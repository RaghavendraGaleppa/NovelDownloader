# Chapter 355: Such a Large Frame, Yet Such a Waste

Xuanlin trembled violently, his knees shattering the bluestone floor into a web of cracks. The gills at his throat flared uncontrollably, spewing bloody foam with a fishy stench.

"The Penglai Pavilion's Sea Suppressor, Xuanlin?"

Xuan Yunfan stepped forward slowly. With each step, unrefined foreign true qi seeped from his pores. A wisp of the Dragon Tiger Sect's crimson true qi had just slipped out from between the scales of his dragon armor when he casually grabbed it, pinching it like a living creature and forcing it back into his body.

Xuanlin watched in horror as the forcibly absorbed true qi transformed into writhing serpents of light beneath Yunfan's skin, only to be digested in an instant.

Xuan Yunfan's gaze was sharp as lightning as he examined the prostrate Xuanlin with keen interest. The ten-zhang-tall merfolk warrior trembled uncontrollably, the deep-sea meteoric iron scales on his battle armor making faint clicking sounds—the sound of his fear-stricken body's scales clashing against each other.

"I didn't expect Penglai Pavilion to be raising demonic beasts..." Xuan Yunfan's fingers idly toyed with a wisp of unrefined foreign true qi, his tone laced with amusement. "Is the energy within you true qi, or demonic qi?"

Xuanlin's gills flared violently as he stammered, "It... it's demonic qi, pure deep-sea demonic qi!" He deliberately emphasized the words "demonic qi," his scaled hands digging desperately into the stone floor.

Just moments ago, the image of Penglai Pavilion's beautiful matron being drained dry by the Ten Extremes true qi was still fresh in his mind. Her voluptuous body had visibly withered and shriveled, ultimately becoming a skeleton draped in finery. What was even more terrifying was that Xuan Yunfan had executed this sinister cultivation art with the ease of a leisurely stroll.

Heaven have mercy, the Ten Extremes Martial Way in the hands of the Sword Sage, Lone Nine, was not this malevolent. According to the sect's ancient texts, when the Sword Sage Lone Nine once used the Ten Extremes Martial Way to evolve the "Ten Extremes Heavenly Sword," the sword's emergence was like a galaxy in reverse, its cold light tearing through the void. Wherever that three-foot green blade reached, the experts of the six great sects bowed their heads. The Sword Pavilion Master had his lifebound sword shattered in one strike, the Nine Luminaries Sect Master was torn apart by sword light before he could even use the Great Sun Glaze Art, and the Dragon Tiger Manifestation of the True Origin Sect Master crumbled like paper under the sword's might.

Lone Nine's swordsmanship had reached the realm of "All Qi Returns to the Blade." Before an opponent's true qi could even approach him, it would be shattered by his sharp sword intent. Why would he need to forcibly seize and absorb it like Xuan Yunfan? In the battle across the eight hundred li of frozen plains back then, half of the six great sects' guardian divine weapons were destroyed, yet they couldn't even dull Lone Nine's sword edge in the slightest.

But now, Xuan Yunfan had twisted this supreme martial way into a demonic art. The Ten Extremes true qi, like a gaping maw, devoured the cultivation of others. Wherever it passed, even Nine-Realm Grandmasters became dried skeletons, their very souls seemingly devoured by that sinister true qi. As the true qi churned in his palm, the Dragon Tiger true qi, the Sword Pavilion's sharpness, and the Buddhist sect's true energy were all forcibly refined, transforming into serpents of light that writhed beneath his skin, ultimately becoming nourishment for the Ten Extremes Martial Way.

Such demonic might bore no resemblance to the righteous sword intent of the Sword Sage Lone Nine from years past. There was only that terrifying soul-absorbing technique that made one's spine crawl with cold.

Xuanlin stole a glance around. The nine mighty Nine-Realm Grandmasters, who had once dominated their respective regions, now lay collapsed like harvested grain. Some had their chests caved in, others their heads shattered, but what was most terrifying were the few "empty shells" that had been drained of their true qi. Their gaunt faces were frozen in the despair of their final moments, as if their souls had been completely devoured by that诡异 Ten Extremes true qi. Just one look at them would likely haunt one's nightmares for a lifetime.

"It's a pity then," Xuan Yunfan chuckled softly, the Ten Extremes true qi in his palm gradually calming. The true qi swirling around him faintly revealed nine different types of true qi being fused and refined. Those were the lifelong cultivations of the nine experts he had just defeated—the ferocity of the Dragon Tiger Sect, the sharpness of the Sword Pavilion, the depth of the Maitreya Temple... all had become the finest nourishment for the Ten Extremes Martial Way.

Hearing the hint of regret in Xuan Yunfan's voice, Xuanlin secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Just as he was about to speak, his throat barely producing a pleading tremor, his pupils suddenly constricted. The right hand that Xuan Yunfan had lowered was now silently rising. The Ten Extremes true qi in his palm, like a vortex from the abyss, pulled all the remaining Dragon Tiger true qi and Sword Pavilion remnants into his skin. The writhing serpents of light instantly surged, condensing into a mountain-like pressure between his five fingers.

"All that size, yet wasted," Xuan Yunfan sighed, his hand pressing down like the sky collapsing.

Xuanlin's ten-zhang merfolk body sank violently. His scales exploded with a thousand cracks, as if the weight of an entire mountain had suddenly pressed down on his spine. He could clearly hear his bones groaning under the unbearable strain, his organs twisting and deforming under the挤压 of the terrifying true qi, and the core of his demonic qi was crushed to the brink of shattering.

The last light in his vision was the churning Ten Extremes true qi in Xuan Yunfan's palm. That true qi was like the world's sharpest blade, easily tearing through his protective demonic qi like it was flesh. The crisp sound of scales falling mixed with the muffled sound of flesh exploding filled his ears.

In his dying moment, Xuanlin suddenly understood why the dried-up Grandmasters' faces were frozen in despair. The moment the thought of struggling arose, he felt a chilling touch on the crown of his head—Xuan Yunfan's palm had lightly pressed against his skull.

*Bang!*

Like a heavy hammer shattering a glass cup, Xuanlin's vision plunged into complete darkness. His kneeling body still maintained its begging posture, but from the top of his head to his waist, it had collapsed into a thin layer. The unique azure demonic blood of the merfolk hadn't even splashed out before it was vaporized into a scarlet mist by the Ten Extremes true qi.

When Xuan Yunfan withdrew his palm, the platform trembled and cracked with a spiderweb of fissures. He merely brushed the blood mist from his sleeve, as if he had just crushed nothing more than an ant.

Only a single, incontinent old steward remained, slumped in a corner. His trousers were soaked in foul liquid, and his murky eyes were frozen in terror. His枯瘦 fingers dug desperately into the gaps between the blue bricks, as if this could help him avoid the恶魔's gaze. But Xuan Yunfan merely swept a glance over him, as if passing over a speck of insignificant dust.

The lingering resonance of the Ten Extremes true qi still flowed around Xuan Yunfan. The unrefined foreign true qi, like living creatures, coiled around his arms—the Dragon Tiger Sect's crimson true qi writhed like fire snakes, the Sword Pavilion's piercing sword light condensed into ice crystal fragments, and the Maitreya Temple's golden Buddhist aura turned into floating dust. He casually raised his hand and crushed a wisp of Penglai's Weak Water true qi that tried to escape. The exploding azure light in his palm made his pupils seem as deep as an abyss.

Though Xuan Yunfan appeared calm on the surface, the Ten Extremes true qi within him was churning like a turbulent abyss. The foreign true qi he had forcibly seized was now like trapped beasts, charging wildly through his flesh and blood. Distorted patterns occasionally bulged beneath his skin, as if countless serpents of light were tearing and struggling within his muscles.

A wisp of Nine Luminaries true qi suddenly shot out from between his fingers, exploding into fine golden-red light in the air. Immediately after, the residual true qi of the True Origin Sect's Dragon Tiger Manifestation溢出 from behind his ear, dissipating as green smoke.
