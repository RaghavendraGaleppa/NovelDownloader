# Chapter 4: Only Seeking Longevity

At Seven Mysteries Sect, every inner disciple, after two years of basic training at the Hundred Forging Hall, would be assigned to a senior protector or hall master to formally apprentice and learn more profound martial arts. Afterwards, those who made great contributions or possessed exceptional talent might be admitted into the Seven Absolute Hall to be taught unique skills. Disciples who distinguished themselves in the inner sect assessment and entered the Seven Absolute Hall, however, did not need to undergo the two years of basic training; they would be directly accepted as personal disciples by several deputy sect masters and taught the sect's unique skills.

After completing their registration at the Seven Absolute Hall, disciples from the External Affairs Hall would send good news to the new entrants' families based on the registration information. Han Zhen already imagined his Third Uncle's joy at learning they both remained in the Seven Mysteries Sect, surely leading to a grand celebratory banquet.

Subsequently, under the guidance of a senior disciple, the two arrived at the mid-slope of the peak where the Seven Absolute Hall was located. Here, there was a courtyard composed of many stone houses, and any empty room could be chosen freely. After a full day, Han Zhen felt tired, and Wu Yan's legs were trembling; he had no energy left to bother Han Zhen. However, even if Wu Yan had any intentions, Han Zhen wouldn't care. After formally apprenticing and learning internal cultivation methods, Han Zhen was certain that he and Wu Yan would soon belong to different worlds. Even if Wu Yan's brother-in-law was a deputy sect master, he wouldn't be able to bully disciples under other deputy sect masters. His only goal was to embark on the immortal path; he wouldn't waste time on the disputes of ordinary people.

Han Zhen found a relatively clean stone house in a secluded spot and hung up his nameplate. This would be his living quarters for at least the next four years. Soon, dedicated personnel delivered bedding and other daily necessities. After washing himself with cool water, Han Zhen ate some dry rations, lay down on the bed, and fell into a deep sleep.

Four days later, the entrance examination for the last batch of disciples was completed. A total of twenty-one individuals were admitted into the Seven Absolute Hall, including several young girls. Among them, there was a small girl with a decent appearance who quickly became the center of attention for this batch of Seven Absolute Hall disciples. Having lived two lives, Han Zhen naturally had no interest in such frail and petite girls and paid little attention to the squabbles and jealousies among the children. Currently, Han Zhen's mind was solely focused on quickly apprenticing under a sect master, learning the Seven Mysteries Sect's internal cultivation methods, and cultivating true qi. This way, if he managed to obtain the Evergreen Art incantation from Han Li a month later, he could use the internal cultivation method's training style as a reference. Han Zhen remembered that Han Li had successfully guided qi into his body and embarked on the immortal path in this manner, though it took him a full three months to develop a sense of qi. In other words, if Han Zhen himself, even with the assistance of the [Heaven Rewards Diligence] karmic luck, couldn't guide qi into his body within a hundred days, it would mean he wasn't even a pseudo-spiritual root.

Han Zhen remembered that in this world, those born with spiritual roots were one in ten thousand. Spiritual roots were divided into five-element attributes: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Most people with spiritual roots possessed a mixture of five or four multiple attributes. Without a fortuitous encounter, one could only cultivate basic five-element techniques to the third or fourth layer throughout their life and then stop, with 99% having no hope of Foundation Establishment. Thus, they were called "pseudo-spiritual roots." Spiritual roots formed by a combination of two or three attributes, due to their faster cultivation speed, were called "true spiritual roots." Beyond these, there was also the single-attribute spiritual root, known as a "heavenly spiritual root." Its cultivation speed was astonishingly fast, and it had no Core Formation bottleneck. Such a heaven-defying spiritual root might only be discovered once every few centuries. However, another type, seen once every few decades, was a spiritual root formed by the mutation and sublimation of two or three five-element spiritual roots, known as a "variant spiritual root." The cultivation speed of variant spiritual roots was even comparable to heavenly spiritual roots, but they lacked the heavenly spiritual root's talent for exempting Core Formation bottlenecks. Examples include the Lightning Spiritual Root, which sublimes from Earth and Water, and the Dark Spiritual Root, which sublimes from Wood and Water. They could also cultivate basic five-element techniques, but if they could find cultivation methods that matched their specific attributes, their combat power could equal three or four ordinary cultivators of the same cultivation level.

On this day, the new disciples of the Seven Absolute Hall all changed into new satin robes, representing their Seven Absolute Hall identity, and were led to Sunset Peak, the main peak of the Seven Mysteries Sect, to pay respects to the Sect Master and the three Deputy Sect Masters. After worshipping the ancestors and swearing allegiance upon entry, each Deputy Sect Master introduced their skilled martial arts and unique techniques. The new disciples would then choose their own master, with Sect Master Wang himself not participating in this process. Han Zhen immediately ruled out Deputy Master Ma, who was the portly old man on top of the Bone Forging Cliff that day, and Wu Yan's backer in the Seven Mysteries Sect. Just as Han Zhen was deliberating between the two remaining choices, a Deputy Sect Master named Wu stepped forward and specifically requested Han Zhen to join his disciples. The other deputy sect master was displeased because he had long known there was a promising talent with excellent aptitude among this batch of disciples. It was precisely because of the difficulty in assigning him that the past rule of the Sect Master choosing was changed. Han Zhen then remembered that Deputy Master Wu was the second strongest expert in the Seven Mysteries Sect, with staff techniques that were truly divine. Before the two deputy sect masters could start arguing over him, Han Zhen made his decision. Deputy Master Wu laughed heartily three times, his face glowing with satisfaction.

The next day, in the courtyard.

After completing the apprenticeship ceremony, Deputy Master Wu had a heart-to-heart talk and only then learned that Han Zhen possessed no basic martial arts knowledge, completely unaware of the Twelve Main Meridians, Eight Extraordinary Meridians, or the locations of acupoints throughout the body. He had merely spent money to learn some basic stance methods from outer disciples of the Seven Mysteries Sect, and then, for three years, relied on arduous practice to achieve minor accomplishment in an external martial arts boxing style! Deputy Master Wu marveled even more, sighing with relief that he had argued for and accepted Han Zhen as his disciple before anyone else; this time, he truly found a treasure. Not only were his bone structure and character top-notch, but his comprehension was truly heaven-defying!

However, all martial arts begin with a foundation. Even disciples of the Seven Absolute Hall must first cultivate the Seven Mysteries Sect's introductory internal cultivation method, the "True Yang Force." After explaining the basics of True Yang Force, Master Wu further elucidated the cultivation realms of Jianghu martial artists to Han Zhen and the others. Those who haven't cultivated true qi are considered unranked. As the saying goes, "Practicing boxing without cultivating internal energy leads to nothing in the end."

"The Jianghu is divided into three major realms: True Qi, Grandmaster, and Heavenly Human."

"There can be a vast, heaven-and-earth-like gap even between individuals in the True Qi Realm. Initial true qi can only snap branches, while highly cultivated true qi can manifest sword auras. Therefore, strength and reputation in this realm are earned through combat."

"As for the Grandmaster realm, the former patriarch of the Seven Mysteries Sect was a Grandmaster."

At this point, Deputy Master Wu began to speak eloquently about the Seven Mysteries Sect's history of once dominating Jingzhou. Finally, there was the Martial Dao Innate realm. This was merely a legendary realm circulated within the Jianghu, one that perhaps someone had once reached. The other newly admitted disciples listened with immense longing, but only Han Zhen remained unmoved. Compared to longevity and eternal youth, a martial artist's decades of roaming the mortal world were merely transient smoke.

Master Wu sighed. His own age was not young; in a few more years, his qi and blood would begin to decline. Let alone the legendary Innate realm, even the Grandmaster realm was just a dream. However, now he had a disciple in whom he could entrust his dreams. Under Master Wu's guidance, all seven new disciples began to attempt cultivating the True Yang Force, seeking to perceive the ethereal qi sensation.
