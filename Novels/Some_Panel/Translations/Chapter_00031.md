# Chapter 31: Canglan Island, Canglan Sect

“Refining the Demonic Core Pill requires not only a demonic core but also a spirit herb, the Demon-Companion Grass,” Huoyuan continued.

“Demon-Companion Grass?” Yang Ji mentally noted it, then gestured for Huoyuan to continue.

“The Demon-Companion Grass emits a very special scent that demon beasts particularly enjoy. This scent can help them quickly enter a cultivation state, similar to the Calm-Mind Pills that human cultivators take.”

“It’s precisely because of this unique medicinal property of the Demon-Companion Grass that it can suppress the demonic nature within the demonic core, allowing the refined Demonic Core Pill to be consumed by humans.”

“Furthermore, Demon-Companion Grass is also the main ingredient for refining Demon Lure Pills, making it extremely valuable.”

“Fortunately, this spirit herb can reproduce through roots and seeds and is easy to grow, so after all these years, there are still quite a few in the ocean.”

“When demon beasts usually encounter this spirit herb, they gather it and plant it in their own caves.”

“Therefore, if a cultivator wants to find this spirit herb, they only need to find a demon beast’s lair.”

“It is precisely due to the existence of Demonic Core Pills and Demon-Companion Grass that a special profession has emerged in the Thousand Island Sea: Demon Hunters!” Huoyuan slowly explained.

“Demon Hunters? Why is there no such term on Southern Wind Island? Cultivators who go out to sea are generally called adventurers,” Yang Ji wondered, then asked, “Why have I never seen Demon-Companion Grass sold in the various shops on Southern Wind Island?”

“Heh heh, because there’s simply no Demon-Companion Grass within the Thousand Island Sea, so Demon Hunters wouldn’t appear here. They operate in the Demonic Scent Sea, which lies beyond the Thousand Island Sea. That region produces Demon-Companion Grass and is a paradise for demon beasts. Demon Hunters usually hunt demon beasts and search for Demon-Companion Grass in that sea. Demon-Companion Grass from the distant Demonic Scent Sea wouldn’t be sold on Southern Wind Island, nor would there be any point in selling it here, so it’s normal that Master hasn’t seen it,” Huoyuan chuckled.

“I see!” Yang Ji nodded and asked, “Then where can I buy Demon-Companion Grass?”

Demonic cores were sold in various shops, but only this Demon-Companion Grass was what he currently needed.

“Although Demon-Companion Grass is more abundant than some high-grade spirit herbs, it’s equally precious. Other islands probably don’t sell it. You’d only find it on Canglan Island, Nanyuan Island, or Changqing Island, the three largest islands,” Huoyuan said.

“Little Brother Yang, coincidentally, our merchant ship is setting sail again in three days, and it’s headed precisely for Canglan Island. If you wish to go, you can come along. You can also help your old brother guard the ship once more, though this time I won’t be able to pay you,” Jin Dafu said with a smile.

“Alright, then many thanks, Old Jin,” Yang Ji bowed his hands, then continued to chat with Huoyuan in detail.

After leaving the Myriad Treasure Pavilion at noon, Yang Ji went straight back to his small house in the southern part of the city. Upon returning, he immediately opened his furnace. After a day of refining, all thirteen portions of the herbs he had just bought had been transformed into Spirit Essence Pills. For the next two days, he cultivated while quietly waiting for the day of departure.

Time passed quickly. Three days flew by in a flash.

Yang Ji left his house early, accepting the invitation to embark on the sea journey. Their destination this time was Canglan Island, described in books as a massive island resembling a continent. Canglan Island was as famous as Nanyuan Island and Changqing Island, making it one of the three largest islands in the Thousand Island Sea. It was a place of beautiful mountains and waters, with a flourishing population. The island was home to one high-grade spirit vein, six mid-grade spirit veins, and nine low-grade spirit veins, making it a rare and precious cultivation ground. However, this land of natural treasures was firmly occupied by the Canglan Sect, leaving others to covet it in vain.

At Southern Wind Port, a large ship slowly sailed out, carried by the gentle breeze. On board, most of the crew were the same people who had previously sailed with the ship. After all, this job of sailing with the ship was a good one; one trip could earn several hundred spirit stones. If one were to struggle out in the open sea, with a bit of bad luck, they might not earn that much in several months. The crowd chatted and drank spirit tea on the deck. Xu Xiangsong and others also talked about their previous trip to the volcano and inquired about Liu Yongqing. Yang Ji naturally gave a vague answer, shaking his head regretfully, implying Liu Yongqing might have died in the snake swarm. Xu Xiangsong and Tan Guanghong exchanged glances and did not press further. The situation at the time had indeed been very dangerous and tense, and anything could have happened. Everyone shook their heads, guessing that Liu Yongqing might indeed have met with misfortune, and then no longer brought up the matter. Yang Ji was happy for that.

The large ship sailed on, the journey smooth and uneventful, without disaster or mishap. Five days later, the ship arrived at Canglan Island port. This place truly lived up to its reputation as one of the three great islands; a quick glance at the port revealed thousands of large ships docked, and countless small boats, like ants. Ships came and went ceaselessly, and the air was filled with bustling human voices, making it incredibly lively. Just observing this small corner, one could tell how prosperous Canglan Island was. The scene was extraordinary, truly befitting an island where the Canglan Sect was established.

Canglan Island was vast, with a straight-line distance of a hundred thousand li from east to west. To reach Canglan City, flying would take a significant amount of time, so taking a teleportation array was the best option. After disembarking, they flew a short distance and, about five li from the port, saw a large teleportation hall in a plaza. Inside the hall were eight teleportation arrays, all carved onto the floor paved with spatial stones. The teleportation array patterns were circular, intricately drawn, exuding a sense of profound mystery.

“Where to?” a middle-aged cultivator in a white robe asked, looking at them indifferently.

“Canglan City!” Jin Dafu replied.

“Ten spirit stones per person,” the middle-aged cultivator stated.

“Thank you,” Jin Dafu handed over the spirit stones collected from everyone. The attendant scanned them with his divine sense, counted the amount, and nodded, “Stand on the array.”

As soon as everyone stood in place, the array patterns flashed. Amidst the surge of spiritual light, a powerful force pulled them into a different dimension, as if they were caught in a deep water vortex, their bodies enveloped by a mysterious energy. After a dizzying sensation, when everyone opened their eyes again, they had already arrived at the teleportation hall on the other side.

As they exited the hall, they saw a massive ancient city towering before them. The ancient city was grand and imposing, its walls thick and towering into the clouds, filled with the vicissitudes of time, like an immortal palace that had fallen from the heavens, ancient yet magnificent. On the city walls, three powerful characters, "Canglan City," were carved in vigorous strokes. Yang Ji, visiting for the first time, couldn't help but take a long, deep look. But his gaze was quickly drawn to the scene in the distance beyond the ancient city.

Behind the ancient city, extending to the horizon like a painting, mountain ranges undulated, rosy clouds hung high, purple qi ascended, and spirit birds occasionally emerged from the mists. Divine rainbows flashed now and then, and the atmosphere of an immortal realm was intense, practically overflowing.

“That is…” Yang Ji murmured.

Jin Dafu followed Yang Ji’s gaze and chuckled, “That’s Canglan Sect. Are you captivated, Little Brother Yang? If you could get in, then I’d finally have someone in a sect.”

“Which of us rogue cultivators doesn’t want to join a sect? But how many actually can?” Everyone longed for it, yet also felt regret.

“Sects only look at root bones, how shallow,” someone muttered disdainfully.

“Leaving aside root bones, how am I, He Chao, inferior to anyone?”

“Stop complaining, let’s go, we’re entering the city.” Jin Dafu smiled and led everyone into the city.

The city was exceptionally prosperous, with crisscrossing streets, bustling crowds, and countless shops. There was Tang Family Artifact Forging, Xiao Family Pill Tower, Han Family Medicine Shop, Wu Family Talisman Store, and everything imaginable. Yang Ji’s goal was clear: to buy Demon-Companion Grass, and to check out high-grade pills and spirit herbs. He continuously entered and exited various shops and pavilions. From one end of the city to the center, he visited dozens of shops, and without exception, none had Demon-Companion Grass, nor high-grade spirit herbs or high-grade pills for sale.

Furthermore, he discovered many other rogue cultivators with the same goal, frequently inquiring about high-grade pills. Many cultivators even permanently staked out various shops; as soon as a rare item appeared, they would swiftly snatch it, leaving no chance for him. Yang Ji now realized how severe the situation was; thankfully, he possessed the skill of alchemy, otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable. No wonder so many rogue cultivators became alchemists midway through their cultivation; they were simply forced into it.

With no luck in finding Demon-Companion Grass or high-grade spirit herbs, Yang Ji frowned as he walked out of a shop. Then, he set off again, walking from the city center towards the other end of the city. He once again inquired at dozens of shops along the way, but similarly, found no Demon-Companion Grass, nor high-grade spirit herbs or high-grade pills.
