# Chapter 91: Monk Xingtai

Amidst the crowd, Lin Fan suddenly formed hand seals. Two thick bolts of lightning materialized out of thin air, striking down the cultivators on either side and sending them tumbling.

He then produced a golden whip, electricity crackling along its length as he swung it. Every magical artifact it touched conducted the current straight to their wielders. One by one, the cultivators collapsed, their bodies wreathed in crackling electric rings until they were thoroughly cooked inside and out.

"Damn it!"
"Where did this monster come from?"
"Get out of the way!"

Shouts of alarm rose from the crowd as Lin Fan's unstoppable charge left a trail of electrocuted bodies in his wake. 

Lin Shan, watching from his position, was shocked by Lin Fan's combat prowess. The man was practically a walking high-voltage line, slaughtering his way through Qi Condensation cultivators with ease. That golden whip was likely even more terrifying than his own Cold Iron Sword.

Seeing his clan brother charging ahead, Lin Shan knew he couldn't just stand by. Gritting his teeth, he plunged into the fray. 

Thankfully, his Cloud-Copper Heart Mirror provided solid defense. As he advanced, all manner of weapons—swords, spears, axes, hooks, banners, and miniature pagodas—rained down on him in a cacophony of metallic clangs. Various area-of-effect spells—fire rain, water arrows, earth spikes, vines, and golden blades—came flying at him from all directions. Lin Shan hacked his way forward with the Cold Iron Sword while relying on healing talismans to push through.

By the time he caught up to Lin Fan, his internal organs ached from the strain, and the protective barrier from his heart mirror had been worn down to a thin film. Several unknown insects—likely released by some cultivator—were gnawing away at it with audible crunching sounds.

In stark contrast, Lin Fan was completely unharmed. A radiant, multicolored robe swirled around him, its light shifting through five distinct hues. Remarkably, it could automatically adjust its defensive properties to counter whatever elemental attack came its way.

"Five Elements Robe!" Lin Shan immediately recognized this famed high-grade magical artifact.

Each Five Elements Robe was said to be incredibly difficult to craft, requiring the meticulous work of a master artificer and rare spiritual materials. Their price was nearly half that of a Golden Core cultivator's magic treasure. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators would find them prohibitively expensive. In the entire Great Song cultivation world, there were probably fewer than ten people who owned one.

Of course, while the Five Elements Robe excelled at defending against spells, Lin Shan's Cloud-Copper Heart Mirror was superior against physical attacks—each had its strengths and weaknesses. Physical defense was crucial for preventing instant kills from ambushes, but in large-scale battles, the Five Elements Robe clearly had the advantage.

With spells flying wildly across the battlefield, dodging was nearly impossible. Unless one was supremely confident in their skills, ranged attacks were preferable to close combat. Yet Lin Fan charged ahead without hesitation, wielding his golden whip with reckless abandon. No cultivator's melee weapon could withstand his lightning—after all, most magical artifacts contained conductive materials.

Cultivators trained in spiritual energy, not physical endurance. Few could withstand high-voltage electricity. Seeing Lin Fan charging toward them, the remaining cultivators scrambled out of his way, allowing Lin Shan to follow closely behind.

"Hand over the map and the statue!" Lin Fan bellowed.

The leader of the group—the one carrying the ancient treasure map and the Joyful Buddha Statue—paled at Lin Fan's approach. His face twisted with reluctance, but survival instinct won out. He pulled out a scroll and a statue from his robes and tossed them in opposite directions, clearly hoping to escape with his life.

Just then, a thunderous voice boomed from a hundred meters away, each word striking their hearts like a drumbeat:

"This humble monk has come upon hearing of the Joyful Buddha Statue's appearance!"

The voice carried such power that every cultivator on the battlefield froze in shock. 

The reason was simple: though the words sounded like ordinary speech, they resonated directly in everyone's minds—this was spiritual sense transmission! Only cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage or above could project their voices through spiritual sense.

A few, including the leader who had just thrown away the treasures, recognized the newcomer.

"Monk Xingtai!"

Remembering the monk's promise of a thousand spirit stones for the Joyful Buddha Statue, the leader immediately regretted his decision and lunged to retrieve the statue he had just discarded.

But Lin Fan and Lin Shan were already in motion. Lin Fan snatched the ancient treasure map, while Lin Shan cleanly caught the Buddha statue.

The moment the items changed hands, Monk Xingtai arrived, covering the hundred-meter distance in an instant.

All fighting ceased as the cultivators turned to face the newcomer.

A gray-robed old monk hovered on a cloud platform, a golden wheel in hand, his expression one of solemn compassion.

"This humble monk seeks the Joyful Buddha Statue," he announced. "Which fellow Daoist holds it? I am willing to pay handsomely."

Though he addressed the crowd, his gaze settled unerringly on Lin Shan—his spiritual sense had already revealed everything.

Lin Shan remained expressionless. The moment he caught the statue, his enhancement panel had briefly appeared. Just like the statue from Yi Chuan, this one bore the mark of the Joyful Deity, used to gather faith. It contained 10 points of ancient essence, which he absorbed immediately, bringing his total to 88.

Now facing a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Lin Shan had no intention of keeping the statue. Avoiding conflict was the priority.

But before he could act, the former owner of the treasures stepped forward, bowing to Monk Xingtai.

"Venerable Monk! These two thieves stole both the Joyful Buddha Statue and the ancient treasure map from me! I beg you to uphold justice!" He added enticingly, "If you help me recover them, I will gladly present the statue to you as thanks!"

The man's scheme was transparent—Monk Xingtai would retrieve both items, and he would "gift" the statue in return, effectively reclaiming the treasure map while saving the monk a thousand spirit stones. A win-win.

However, at the mention of the "ancient treasure map," Monk Xingtai's expression changed dramatically.

He had come solely for the Joyful Buddha Statue, intending to purchase it from Lin Shan as a show of goodwill. But if this "ancient treasure map" was indeed present—especially one linked to a secret Zen Buddhist treasure—he couldn't let it slip away.

As a Buddhist cultivator, he knew exactly what the map represented: a key fragment to unlocking a hidden Zen treasury. Securing it was imperative, and secrecy was paramount. If word got out, other Foundation Establishment cultivators would swarm in, complicating matters.

Monk Xingtai's face darkened as he weighed his options. To claim the map, he would have to eliminate every witness here—no survivors. Even one escapee could ruin his reputation and invite retribution.

His gaze swept across the battlefield, already calculating the most efficient way to silence everyone permanently.

The cultivator who had spoken up waited nervously for a response. When none came, he looked up—only to meet the monk's murderous glare.
