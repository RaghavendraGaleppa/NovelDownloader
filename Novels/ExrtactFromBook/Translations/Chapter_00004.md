# Chapter 4: Settling In  

Han Yue exerted control over the kitchen knife, carefully slicing along the grain of the beef.  

As the blade touched the meat, he felt as if he were cutting through a piece of elastic steel. An unusual force within the beef resisted, pushing back against the knife's edge.  

This strange energy was difficult to handle—no wonder most cultivators couldn't work as meat cutters, and no one had stepped forward to take the job earlier!  

But Han Yue had his own method. He connected with the **[Thoughtless Slash]** rune in his mind, drawing out a thread of lightning energy.  

This thread of lightning coursed through his meridians, spreading across his entire body before finally channeling through the knife's tip, suppressing the bizarre force within the beef.  

Then, with a swift motion, Han Yue cleanly sliced off a strip of meat.  

The young woman watching him immediately cheered. For her, Han Yue's ability to handle the meat-cutting task was nothing short of a godsend!  

The entire meat-cutting team's morale instantly lifted. The previously tense atmosphere eased, and everyone worked faster.  

Han Yue continued slicing, producing uniform strips of meat that were quickly distributed. With his help, the speed of meat distribution finally caught up with the growing line of people waiting.  

As the crowd thinned, Han Yue grew more proficient. His speed increased until he surpassed the other three cutters.  

Lightning energy flowed through his body, continuously tempering his flesh. The impurities within him were shattered by the lightning, making his muscles and bones increasingly dense and refined.  

Finally, after another hour or so, the beef was fully divided.  

The young woman stepped forward again and announced loudly:  

"Today, the No. 9 Courtyard of the Celestial District has successfully distributed meat! We thank all our friends for your support!"  

"This time, we obtained a total of 130,000 jin of first-tier demonic beast—Steel Ghost Beef—and it has all been distributed!"  

"Our courtyard wishes all those who received meat success in their physical refinement!"  

"Until next time!"  

With that, the entire team dispersed, packing up everything in the square onto three large carts.  

The young woman pulled Han Yue onto one of the carts, and the convoy swiftly departed.  

Han Yue could sense the team's goodwill toward him and smoothly integrated into their ranks.  

Not long after they left, he witnessed another astonishing sight—a massive reptilian corpse was being slowly transported toward the central square where they had just finished distributing meat.  

At the head of the procession, a burly man cleared the way, shouting as he walked:  

"No. 73 Courtyard of the Earth District will distribute first-tier demonic beast—Blazing Lizard meat today!"  

"All guests seeking to refine their bodies with this meat, please come quickly!"  

Yet another meat distribution team!  

As a newcomer, Han Yue was deeply curious about the workings of the Meat Distribution Market.  

This was the first large human settlement he had encountered after leaving the primeval forest. Having traveled too far already, he didn't hesitate to stop and enter.  

Before arriving at the central square, he had spent half a day exploring the city. Fortunately, the white fox fur bundle he carried had been well-preserved, keeping all his valuables safe.  

Han Yue exchanged some gold and silver for new clothes and enjoyed a hearty meal, finally shaking off his exhaustion.  

Then, he wandered the city in search of a place to settle until he followed the crowd to the central square.  

There, he witnessed the grand spectacle of the meat distribution ceremony, leading to his application as a meat cutter.  

The convoy headed toward the Celestial District, winding through the city streets before finally stopping before No. 9 Courtyard.  

The area was divided into two parts—one section consisted of three rows of private courtyards, while the other housed a massive warehouse and a row of commercial shops.  

The carts entered the warehouse, and everyone began unloading.  

"You all keep working. I'll take Han Yue to see his new place!"  

With that, the young woman pulled Han Yue away.  

They had already exchanged names on the cart. The muscular young woman was named Fang Yi, just sixteen years old but already in the Body Refinement stage for four years.  

Standing over two meters tall, Fang Yi towered over Han Yue, who was already a head taller than average at 1.9 meters.  

The two arrived at a small courtyard, where Fang Yi handed Han Yue a key and said:  

"From now on, you can live here without worry. It's very safe."  

"Aside from helping out during the meat distribution ceremony every ninety-nine days, you're free to do whatever you want!"  

"However, the Meat Distribution Market is full of hidden talents, so it's best to keep a low profile. Don't stir up trouble I can't handle."  

"Get settled in first. We'll have a feast tonight—beef heart and liver. Come over when you're ready!"  

With that, Fang Yi left.  

Han Yue unlocked the door and stepped inside.  

The courtyard wasn't large—just over a hundred square meters—with a small courtyard, three side rooms, and all the necessary amenities.  

Han Yue entered the main room, placing his bundle on the table.  

He fetched a basin of hot water, washed up thoroughly, and then lay down in the bedroom.  

At last, Han Yue had secured a place for himself in this world.  

He relaxed completely.  

As he rested, he began carefully considering the information Fang Yi had shared with him on the cart.  

This place was called the **Meat Distribution Market**, established over a thousand years ago.  

Its influence spanned thousands of kilometers, and its reputation was immense—a place countless ordinary people dreamed of for changing their fate.  

The Meat Distribution Market was backed by the forest, surrounded by abundant resources—demonic beasts everywhere and countless spirit herbs. It was home to over a million people and more than a hundred thousand cultivators.  

Within the Meat Distribution Market, the land was divided into 396 independent factions, known as "numbered workshops" or "numbered courtyards."  

No. 9 Courtyard of the Celestial District was one of them.  

Every day, one faction from each of the Celestial, Earth, Mystic, and Yellow Districts had to hunt at least one first-tier demonic beast and distribute its meat in the central square.  

Four distribution rounds took place daily, from morning till night, without pause!  

All members of the 396 factions in the Meat Distribution Market could freely obtain demonic beast meat without any cost—a tremendous benefit.  

Just by joining a numbered faction, one could continuously obtain precious resources without lifting a finger.  

Of course, this also came with immense pressure!  

To maintain their status, each faction had to ensure that, at least once every ninety-nine days, they successfully hunted a qualifying first-tier demonic beast and completed the distribution ceremony.  

A single failure would result in the immediate revocation of their faction's right to exist.  

Additionally, on New Year's Day each year, all ninety-nine factions from the four districts had to unite to hunt a second-tier demonic beast for distribution.  

The responsibility of leading the hunt rotated among the factions, adding another layer of pressure.  

If the hunt for a second-tier demonic beast failed, the leading faction would bear the blame and face elimination.  

Since the Meat Distribution Market's founding, this rule had never been broken!  

Countless factions competed and cooperated, rose and fell here—this was the unique allure of the Meat Distribution Market!
