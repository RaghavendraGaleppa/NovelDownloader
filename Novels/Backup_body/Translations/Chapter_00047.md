# Chapter 47: The Undying Debt! The Immortal Creditor!

Li Zhengjing's heart was in turmoil. The final line of his fortune—being forcibly captured and taken back to the Kunlun Immortal Sect for torture—gave him a splitting headache.  

*It seems this Young Sect Master isn’t an easygoing one!*  

With that thought, he hesitated, considering whether to bid farewell to Jia Shifang and leave early. But when he checked his fortune again, nothing had changed. Whether he left now or not, the Kunlun Young Master would still detect him.  

So he excused himself to relieve himself, slipped into the bushes, and quietly swallowed two low-grade spirit stones.  

**The method to alter fate was as follows:**  

1. **Channel the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi** within his body, using the *Sword Nurturing Technique* to store it in the divine ability of his left arm. Then, conceal the traces with a *Mystic Light Talisman* pasted onto his left arm.  
2. **Consume a bottle of Five Elements Creation Paste** and secretly cultivate the *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique* to quickly generate new internal energy from his organs, masking the sword-intent traces in his original aura.  

*"This costs two low-grade spirit stones? What a rip-off!"*  

Cursing inwardly, Li Zhengjing followed the instructions. He gathered the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi into the 36,500 muscle fibers of his left arm and affixed the Mystic Light Talisman.  

After downing the Five Elements Creation Paste, he quietly practiced the *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique*, careful to minimize any disturbances. Only after refining a few strands of new internal energy did he finally relax and step out of the woods.  

"Second Brother, you sure took your time—must’ve been holding it in for half a year without visiting a brothel," Jia Shifang teased with a smirk.  

"Shifang!"  

The Vajra Temple’s Buddhist disciple chided softly, "You are a disciple of Buddhism. You should remain pure in mind and speech."  

Then, he cast a deep glance at Li Zhengjing and remarked, "Fellow Daoist, your aura just now was rather domineering."  

Li Zhengjing’s heart skipped a beat. Before he could respond, he sensed an overwhelmingly sharp and fierce presence!  

His expression shifted as he turned to face an icy mountain breeze—so cold it stung like blades.  

His gaze sharpened, and in the distance, a hundred yards away, a figure approached slowly.  

Even at this distance, the sharpness of the newcomer’s aura reached him on the wind.  

*"Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi?"*  

*"I thought all who mastered this technique met untimely deaths, and the Kunlun Immortal Sect sealed it away. No one should be practicing it anymore!"*  

*"This Kunlun Young Master also cultivates the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi?"*  

*"No wonder the golden page showed he could detect the sword qi in me—we share the same origin!"*  

Glancing at his left arm, concealed beneath his sleeve by the Mystic Light Talisman, Li Zhengjing felt uneasy.  

If he could sense the Young Master’s sword qi so clearly, then the reverse must also be true—especially since the Young Master’s mastery was likely higher.  

*Would storing the sword qi in his left arm and covering it with the talisman really be enough to evade detection?*  

*Logically, it shouldn’t work...*  

*But the golden page’s method to alter fate had guided him this way.*  

As these thoughts raced through his mind, the figure now stood just ten yards from the pavilion.  

*"This Kunlun Young Master’s presence is even more imposing than Lu Huaiyuan, the top disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect!"*  

Li Zhengjing studied the approaching figure.  

The man wore Daoist robes, appearing to be in his early thirties, with sharp brows and starry eyes—handsome and extraordinary.  

His aura was razor-sharp, so intense that even the mountain wind carried traces of his sword intent.  

Wherever he stepped, the grass at his feet withered and shattered.  

Leaves blown by the wind turned to dust before they could touch him.  

*"His Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi… seems less refined than mine?"*  

A startling thought crossed Li Zhengjing’s mind.  

Then, realization dawned on him.  

Inside the pavilion, the Vajra Temple’s Buddhist disciple stood and bowed.  

"Esteemed Young Sect Master."  

The Kunlun Young Master remained indifferent, not returning the courtesy. His raised brows exuded arrogance.  

"Buddhist Disciple, why are there others present during our meeting?"  

"This is unclaimed land, an abandoned pavilion. I merely borrowed it to rest—I have no right to ask them to leave."  

The Buddhist disciple smiled. "Besides, our meeting today is open and aboveboard. There’s no need for secrecy. Moreover, since we’re near the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, having one of their disciples here as a witness avoids any suspicion of conspiracy..."  

The Kunlun Young Master stepped into the pavilion.  

"Your cultivation has progressed well. You’ve tempered yourself sufficiently—soon, you’ll achieve the Arhat Golden Body, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our Daoist Human Immortals."  

He sat down, his tone cool.  

"Twenty-three years ago, I opened all 365 acupoints in my body, reaching the peak of the True Qi Realm—unrivaled beneath the Human Immortal stage. That year, you had just entered this realm..."  

A trace of melancholy flickered across his sharp features.  

"Yet now, I still haven’t attained Human Immortality, while you approach the Golden Body Realm."  

The Buddhist disciple replied, "Twenty years ago, the Young Sect Master was hailed as the strongest beneath the Immortal Realm, unmatched in the mortal world. This humble monk is far beneath you..."  

The Kunlun Young Master sighed.  

"Two decades have passed, and I’ve regressed. Now, even Lu Huaiyuan of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect rivals me in combat."  

Li Zhengjing, standing outside the pavilion, thought to himself, *"The strongest in the world twenty years ago? Yet after two decades, his power has waned?"*  

The Hanging Bird perched on a tree branch muttered, *"Ancient texts say cultivation is like sailing against the current—if you don’t advance, you regress. This guy must’ve spent twenty years drowning in wine and women instead of training. When I reach his level, I’ll quit drinking—no distractions!"*  

Jia Shifang scratched his bald head, utterly confused.  

At that moment, the Kunlun Young Master flicked his sleeve, releasing sword qi that enveloped the pavilion, sealing off all sound.  

"What’s this about?" Jia Shifang moved closer.  

"Come back." Li Zhengjing tugged his sleeve. "Your senior brother didn’t ask us to leave, meaning their conversation isn’t secret. But now, the Young Master clearly doesn’t want us hearing the rest. Don’t invite trouble."  

"If they’re hiding it, it can’t be good," the Hanging Bird whispered. "Are they having an affair?"  

"Hard to say," Jia Shifang murmured. "Back at the temple, I noticed my senior brother avoids women..."  

"Then he probably prefers men," the bird spat. "I *hate* secret rendezvous like this..."  

Outside, whispers and gossip continued.  

Inside, the atmosphere was grave.  

"That Feather Transformation Immortal Sect inner disciple isn’t Lu Huaiyuan—he has no right to hear this."  

The Young Master spoke calmly.  

"You’ve come to Xuanling Prefecture, so you must also believe the Venomous King Xin Xuan is hiding here. You’ve likely heard of the people and events tied to him."  

The Buddhist disciple nodded. "That’s why I descended the mountain."  

"Our ‘debt’ remains unpaid."  

The Young Master’s expression darkened.  

"Seventeen years ago, everyone thought he was dead. But when I passed through the Great Zhou capital recently, I sensed his traces—left behind when Xin Xuan fled the city using a certain treasure."  

He reached into his robe and placed a fragment before the Buddhist disciple.  

"At the time, I didn’t understand the truth and didn’t pursue Xin Xuan. Later, I found this shard in the capital."  

The Buddhist disciple picked it up. "You’re sure it’s his treasure?"  

The Young Master nodded. "Our creditor."  

He tapped the markings on the fragment.  

"The spiritual energy has faded now, but when I found it, traces remained..."  

The Buddhist disciple’s face grew solemn. "So we can confirm Xin Xuan didn’t just stumble upon this treasure by chance."  

"Exactly. The treasure wasn’t activated by Xin Xuan—it was the creditor himself. He was in the capital at the time. After Xin Xuan left, I searched the city but found no trace of him. He must’ve left soon after."  

The Buddhist disciple sighed. "Seventeen years ago, the previous Feather Transformation Sect Leader died with him... Yet he still lives."  

The Young Master stood.  

"I am the next leader of the Kunlun Immortal Sect. You, barring unforeseen events, will be the next abbot of the Vajra Temple."  

"If our creditor still lives, he *will* come to collect. When that day comes, we’ll have to face him."  

"Recently, three of our sect’s Grand Elders deduced that although the previous Feather Transformation Leader sacrificed his life, he didn’t succeed in killing the creditor. However, the creditor must’ve suffered grievous injuries—even after seventeen years, he may not have fully recovered."  

"Xin Xuan is our only lead. We *must* capture him alive and trace the creditor’s whereabouts!"  

With that, the Young Master leaped into the air, his True Qi erupting like blades as he soared toward Xuanling Prefecture.  

His voice echoed behind him:  

"Monk, seal off Xuanling Prefecture. I’ll capture Xin Xuan before anyone else!"  

The Buddhist disciple sighed. "This won’t be easy..."  

His gaze then fell on the two men, one bird, and one tree outside the pavilion. After a moment’s hesitation, he took out a string of prayer beads.  

"Friends, I’d like your help with something."
