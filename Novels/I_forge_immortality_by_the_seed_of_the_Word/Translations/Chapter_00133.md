# Chapter 131: Advancing to Foundation Establishment Realm

In the cultivation chamber.

Zhang Jing maintained his cross-legged meditation posture, his aura suddenly growing still. All his attention was now focused entirely within his Niwan Palace. Under his deliberate control, his spiritual sense had withdrawn to a corner of the Niwan Palace, its fluctuations rapidly calming until they seemed frozen.

At this moment, the construction of his Dao Foundation had reached its final stage.

At the center of the Niwan Palace, a massive Dao pattern—the physical manifestation of his Primordial Beginning True Intent—radiated the terrifying principles of world evolution and Dao creation. It rapidly contracted until it transformed into a mass of chaos.

Yet in the very next instant—

Boom!

Boundless divine light suddenly erupted in all directions.

In that moment, Zhang Jing lost all perception.

Simultaneously, the spiritual energy across the entire immortal island froze. A terrifying aura began to spread throughout the island. Deer Thirty-Eight, who had been diligently cultivating, suddenly collapsed to the ground as if crushed by a massive mountain. Struggling to lift its head, it looked toward the jade pavilion where Zhang Jing resided, its large eyes filled with indescribable terror.

"Master, save me! I'm being crushed to death!" it screamed inwardly.

An unknowable amount of time passed.

Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, a profound Primordial Beginning True Intent flashing within them.

"Foundation Establishment Realm! Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation!"

A surge of joy welled up from the depths of his heart—a celebration from his very life essence, a jubilant chorus from every organ and tissue in his body following the complete transformation of his life's hierarchy.

Through some mysterious sense, Zhang Jing perceived his current lifespan limit.

"Nine hundred years at Foundation Establishment Realm? No, the Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation must be contributing—the actual lifespan for this realm should be three hundred years!"

After careful contemplation, a trace of astonishment flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

Was this the effect of an immortal foundation? The gap between an ordinary Dao Foundation and this was simply too vast.

And this was merely the visible difference in lifespan. In other aspects, the disparity was equally enormous, perhaps even more terrifying than the difference in longevity.

With a thought, the scene within his Niwan Palace appeared before his mind's eye.

A perfectly round treasure pearl, faintly tinged with purple, hovered between existence and non-existence, exuding the profound meaning of the beginning of heaven and earth and the birth of all Daos.

This was the external manifestation of the Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation—bearing striking resemblance to the treasure pearl he had comprehended when grasping the Primordial Beginning Origin World in the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven.

Though the Dao Foundation floated within his Niwan Palace, it faintly connected to the external world, linking with the boundless spiritual energy and countless principles of the universe.

Withdrawing his consciousness from the Niwan Palace, Zhang Jing's mind instinctively merged with the Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation.

In that instant, everything within several hundred miles seemed to reflect perfectly within his perception. He felt that without any spells, he could effortlessly manipulate the spiritual energy within this vast area—moving mountains or diverting rivers would be as easy as flipping his palm.

Moreover—

Returning his awareness to the cultivation chamber, Zhang Jing lightly pointed forward. A spell instantly materialized, enveloped by Primordial Beginning True Intent. Under his control, the spell began to wildly evolve—changing attributes, altering forms—while the surrounding dense spiritual energy was nearly drained dry.

In mere moments, the spell's power had increased dozens of times over and continued to grow rapidly.

Pop!

Zhang Jing instantly extinguished the spell.

Within his dantian, his mana had transformed once more—from its previous profound black to a near-chaotic hue, radiating an even more terrifying aura.

"This is the Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation!" Zhang Jing sighed in admiration.

Yet having received the Primordial Beginning Origin World's legacy, he understood that while the current Dao Foundation appeared immensely powerful, it was merely displaying its most basic capabilities.

The true horror of the Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation lay in its ability to incorporate various Dao Intents through its inherent Primordial Beginning principles, unifying or evolving them to forge a unique path capable of unleashing extraordinary might. This would also lead to the formation of powerful innate divine abilities when advancing to the Golden Core Divine Ability Realm.

These divine abilities would determine what kind of Dao Domain—and ultimately what form of Primordial Beginning Origin World—would manifest.

In other words, only a Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation infused with multiple Dao Intents could truly showcase its glory as an immortal foundation. What he possessed now was merely a blank seed.

With this realization, Zhang Jing's attention turned to the Moonlight Dragon Python Dao Intent curled in a corner of his Niwan Palace. This seemed like a suitable candidate to integrate into his Dao Foundation.

After a moment's hesitation, however, Zhang Jing decisively shook his head.

His current cultivation was still low, and his understanding of the Primordial Beginning Origin World remained shallow. More importantly, he lacked any concrete plan for this legacy's development. Incorporating Dao Intents now might be premature and could backfire.

"It's better to wait until I reach the Upper World," Zhang Jing thought. "There must be numerous records on Primordial Beginning cultivation there, along with mature Dao Intent combination legacies. I'll make my decision after studying them. After all, even a blank Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation is already formidable enough."

As he pondered, Zhang Jing noticed something peculiar. Through his Dao Foundation's connection to heaven and earth, he faintly sensed a discord—as if this world was incomplete. Not just slightly flawed, but riddled with gaps everywhere.

This couldn't be possible, could it?

Unable to believe it, Zhang Jing focused intently. Before long, his brows furrowed deeply. It wasn't an illusion—this world truly had issues! Moreover, he could confirm that due to the Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation's unique nature, attempting to advance his cultivation in such an environment would be highly disadvantageous.

Since the Upper World had opened this legacy to them, it implied their world was intact.

"Troublesome! This means if I want to improve my cultivation now, I must go to the Upper World. I wonder how much time has passed—I hope I can still make it before the next Upper World opening."

Otherwise, he would have to waste a full one hundred and eighty years. Though his lifespan was long, it wasn't meant to be squandered.

As the radiant purple hues gradually faded, a bright streak of light suddenly shot out from the immortal island, stopping directly before the courtyard master.

The light dissipated, revealing Zhang Jing's figure.

"Zhang Jing greets the courtyard master and all pavilion masters," he said with a faint smile.

"Haha, truly worthy of an immortal foundation!" The courtyard master, sensing Zhang Jing's aura, couldn't hide his astonishment and envy. This aura was nearly approaching that of the weakest Heavenly Craft Pavilion Master—who, despite being an incomplete Golden Core cultivator, was still a Golden Core expert! Yet a mere early Foundation Establishment junior was almost catching up.

"Master, you knew I established a purple-grade immortal foundation?" Zhang Jing asked in surprise.

"Of course I knew—the Upper World informed me," the courtyard master replied with a meaningful smile.

"The Upper World?" Zhang Jing's confusion deepened.

"Enough suspense," the courtyard master said. "Zhang Jing, I officially inform you that Upper World True Immortals will descend upon Dragon Lake Dao Academy in three months to escort you to the Upper World for cultivation."

Before Zhang Jing could react, the courtyard master continued, "But before you go, could you do us a favor?"

"A favor?"

"Indeed—challenge the True Spirit Ranking as a disciple of Dragon Lake Dao Academy!" The courtyard master looked at Zhang Jing with eager anticipation.
