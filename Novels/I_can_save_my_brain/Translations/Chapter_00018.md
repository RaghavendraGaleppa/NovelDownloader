# Chapter 18: Water Spirit Pearl  

Upon hearing this, the bearded stall owner's face briefly showed a troubled expression before he shook his head.  

"Apologies, but I can't disclose this matter to you. However..." He paused, then continued, "If I'm not mistaken, you're not a rogue cultivator, are you?"  

"Oh?" Chen Daoxuan's interest was piqued. Without confirming or denying, he asked, "How did you come to that conclusion?"  

"In that situation just now, a novice rogue cultivator would have panicked. But you remained composed, clearly possessing extraordinary confidence. Given your young age and such confidence, you must be a member of a prominent family. I wonder if you're from the Wu, Zhao, or Yang family?"  

Though the bearded man named Zhang San appeared rough, his mind was sharp. He was now probing Chen Daoxuan's background. The three families he mentioned were the most renowned in the surrounding hundred-thousand-mile sea region, aside from the Zhou family—all of them established Foundation Establishment families.  

Chen Daoxuan shook his head. "No need to speculate. I'm not from a Foundation Establishment family but a minor one, hardly worth mentioning."  

Caught in his attempt to pry, Zhang San looked embarrassed. After some thought, as if making a decision, he whispered into Chen Daoxuan's ear, "Are you interested in the refining method for the Wind and Thunder Array Disk?"  

Chen Daoxuan's heart leaped—this was an unexpected boon.  

"I am somewhat interested. Our family has been planning to train artifact refiners recently and is collecting refining methods for various magical artifacts."  

Hearing this, Zhang San's expression turned respectful. A family capable of training artifact refiners was undoubtedly a "major family" with substantial resources. After all, assembling a complete artifact refinement lineage was no easy feat. Ordinary Qi Refinement families lacked the means to nurture such talents.  

Realizing this, Zhang San's tone became more deferential. "My apologies, I was presumptuous earlier!" He bowed deeply to Chen Daoxuan.  

Chen Daoxuan didn’t hold a grudge over the earlier incident—otherwise, he wouldn’t have let Zhang San off when the Zhou family's enforcers were present. Recognizing the goodwill, Zhang San knew what to do next.  

He retrieved a jade slip from his storage bag and transmitted his voice, "Take a look—this is the refining method for the Wind and Thunder Array Disk."  

Chen Daoxuan took the jade slip and probed it with his spiritual sense. Instantly, a wealth of information about refining array disk artifacts flooded his mind.  

Having been deceived once before, Chen Daoxuan scrutinized the contents carefully. After thorough examination, he confirmed that the method recorded in the jade slip was genuine.  

Maintaining his composure, he asked, "How much for this jade slip?"  

Zhang San raised five fingers. "Since you're genuinely interested, I’ll give you a fixed price—five hundred spirit stones!"  

The rogue cultivator named Zhang San watched Chen Daoxuan nervously. Five hundred spirit stones was a staggering sum for a Qi Refinement rogue cultivator—enough to drive many to desperate measures outside Guang'an Prefecture.  

Seeing Zhang San’s furtive demeanor, Chen Daoxuan nodded. "Deal!"  

Purchasing the refining method for an array disk artifact at five hundred spirit stones wasn’t a loss for him. While rogue cultivators might not see the value, for Chen Daoxuan, who aimed to expand his family’s legacy, enriching their heritage was always a worthwhile investment.  

After some discussion, the two deliberately chose to complete the transaction in a rented inn room rather than openly in the market. Neither dared to conduct such a large exchange in public—five hundred spirit stones could easily attract unwanted attention.  

Once the deal was done, Zhang San cupped his hands in farewell and swiftly left the rogue cultivator market. With such a fortune on him, he was undoubtedly more nervous than ever—his cultivation was only at the fourth level of Qi Refinement, barely higher than Chen Daoxuan’s.  

Meanwhile, Chen Daoxuan was in high spirits.  

In just half a day at the rogue cultivator market, he had acquired a rare artifact refining method—not for common offensive or defensive artifacts, but for an auxiliary array disk.  

With this success, he continued browsing the stalls.  

Zhang San’s former spot was now occupied by another rogue cultivator. Shaking his head, Chen Daoxuan moved on until he stopped before a gaunt, black-robed elder.  

He remembered this man—during his earlier dispute with Zhang San, the elder had repeatedly provoked and undermined Zhang San, inadvertently helping Chen Daoxuan.  

Unlike Zhang San’s gregariousness, the black-robed elder exuded an aloof aura. Even as Chen Daoxuan stood before him, the elder ignored him, continuing to meditate silently on his cushion.  

Cultivators, accustomed to long periods of seclusion, often developed eccentric temperaments, so Chen Daoxuan wasn’t bothered.  

"Senior, how much for this Water Spirit Pearl?"  

Chen Daoxuan’s eyes lit up as he spotted a pearl emitting pure water-attribute spiritual energy on the stall.  

Water Spirit Pearls were unique cultivation resources produced by the Zhou family of Spirit Shell Island. These pearls could filter and purify spiritual energy, allowing cultivators to absorb and refine it more efficiently, thereby accelerating cultivation speed.  

However, these treasures had a limited lifespan—typically, a first-grade Water Spirit Pearl would lose its purifying effect after a month, becoming an ordinary pearl.  

Normally, such treasures rarely reached rogue cultivators, as they were usually pre-ordered by major families. Chen Daoxuan wondered how this elder had obtained one.  

At his question, the black-robed elder opened his wrinkled eyes and replied coldly, "One hundred spirit stones. No bargaining."  

"Ah!"  

Chen Daoxuan was taken aback. The market price for a first-grade Water Spirit Pearl from the Zhou family was only fifty spirit stones—this elder was charging double. No wonder no one had bought it despite the foot traffic.  

This wasn’t just a markup—it was daylight robbery!  

Perhaps sensing Chen Daoxuan’s hesitation, the elder explained, "Young friend, look closely. This is a top-grade first-grade spirit pearl. While one hundred spirit stones may seem steep, Water Spirit Pearls are rare. A slight premium is reasonable."  

Chen Daoxuan remained skeptical. He had never seen the Zhou family’s Water Spirit Pearls in person—he only recognized them from descriptions his thirteenth uncle had shared.  

"Suit yourself."  

Seeing Chen Daoxuan’s indecision, the elder, who clearly lacked salesmanship, closed his eyes again.  

"Fine, one hundred it is."  

Water Spirit Pearls were hard to come by, and if the elder’s claim about its quality was true, the price wasn’t entirely unreasonable. Moreover, since the elder had indirectly helped him earlier, paying a premium could be seen as returning the favor.  

Just as the transaction concluded—  

"Woo woo woo!!!"  

A piercing alarm suddenly echoed throughout Guang'an Prefecture’s immortal city.
