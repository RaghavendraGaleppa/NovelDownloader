# Chapter 159: The Snake Daoist and the Bounty Hunt!

**"Thunder Spirit's Seal of Forbidden Arts and Evil Destruction!"**  

"What an imposing name," Gu Yuan couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, inwardly marveling.  

In this world, the names of magical seals were not chosen lightly—unless by ignorant fools from minor sects who didn’t know their limits. Such recklessness would only invite ridicule.  

This particular seal bore the prefix "Forbidden Arts," and since it was listed as a reward, it was undoubtedly extraordinary. Gu Yuan sensed that this seal might hold the key to resolving the hidden dangers within his nascent Dharma Core.  

*"Buzz!"*  

With a thought, he channeled his magic power and reached out to claim the mission.  

*"Whoosh!"*  

Just then, the sound of a drawn bowstring echoed in Gu Yuan’s ears, followed by a sharp surge of magic power that intercepted his own, abruptly cutting off his attempt to accept the mission.  

Gu Yuan remained expressionless. With a flick of his divine sense, he identified the assailant.  

It was a sinister-looking young man with narrow, triangular eyes and thin lips. He wore an unusual short-sleeved robe, and a small black snake coiled around his shoulder, hissing menacingly at Gu Yuan.  

"Fellow Daoist, have you even read the mission requirements?" the young man sneered. "This bounty demands exceptional combat prowess among Foundation Establishment cultivators. You seem unfamiliar—how many missions have you completed? What achievements do you boast of, that you dare claim this task?"  

*"Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!"*  

The black snake on his shoulder hissed in unison, as if mocking Gu Yuan.  

"And what do you propose, Fellow Daoist?" Gu Yuan replied calmly.  

"Step aside. This mission is mine," the young man declared imperiously. Then, with a mocking grin, he added, "You look soft and delicate. Why not take the mission at the Su Yin Island? Lie on that enchantress’s bed—perhaps you’ll make a name for yourself there!"  

He burst into laughter, his snake hissing along as if amused.  

Others in the hall witnessed the scene, some chuckling while others whispered explanations to those unaware.  

"That’s Daoist Snake. He was bitten by a mid-stage Earth Demon Serpent on the Ten Thousand Serpents Island, and the demonic energy damaged his mind, leaving him erratic and reckless. Still, his strength is nothing to scoff at. That black snake of his is an early-stage Earth Demon familiar. Together, they’re a deadly pair—several Foundation Establishment cultivators have already fallen to them."  

"That unfamiliar Daoist doesn’t stand a chance against Daoist Snake."  

---  

Hearing this, the crowd nodded in understanding, while Daoist Snake laughed maniacally.  

In the shadows, a pair of bright, piercing eyes observed the scene, silently assessing who would claim the bounty.  

Gu Yuan remained unfazed by the laughter, but when those eyes turned toward him, he glanced back.  

The owner of those eyes seemed momentarily startled but quickly composed herself.  

Gu Yuan shifted his attention back to the bounty board.  

*"Clang!"*  

This time, instead of mere magic power, a brilliant sword aura flashed like lightning, striking toward the board.  

"You dare?!" Daoist Snake roared, flicking his fingers to release a black arrow of spiritual energy aimed at intercepting Gu Yuan’s sword light.  

*"Shing!"*  

Yet Gu Yuan’s sword aura split into sixteen strands—one continued toward the bounty board while the remaining fifteen twisted like dragons, slashing toward the black arrow.  

The arrow was dark as ink, carrying both speed and a sinister, corrosive force. But the sword light, radiant as the sun, sliced through the black energy effortlessly, dispersing it like scattered clouds.  

Undeterred, the sword aura surged forward with relentless momentum, honing in on Daoist Snake.  

"A sword seal?!" The young man’s face darkened, but madness quickly replaced his shock.  

*"Corrosive Spirit Seal!"***  

With a furious shout, he unleashed a black seal. Instantly, the hall filled with rolling dark mist, within which countless phantom serpents writhed and hissed.  

Yet the sword light remained undiminished, swift as wind and thunder, cleaving through the mist in an instant.  

The serpents wailed, powerless to stop it.  

"Go!"  

Panicking, Daoist Snake flung his black snake into the mist.  

*"Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!"***  

The serpent spewed dense black energy, replenishing the dissipating mist, which now thickened into an oppressive, foreboding shroud.  

*"Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!"***  

The phantom serpents gnawed at the sword aura, dimming its brilliance.  

*"Shing!"***  

But then, the sword light split again—two more strands emerged, revitalizing the fading aura as it slashed through the mist.  

---  

"Tch, is that all you’ve got?" Daoist Snake sneered.  

Yet before he could finish, an overwhelming divine sense descended upon the hall. An invisible three-eyed thunder dragon materialized, its colossal form filling the space, crackling with lightning.  

Daoist Snake’s face paled. He hastily drew a silver token to defend himself.  

*"Swish!"***  

But a small jade mirror, radiating an inexplicable magnetic force, locked onto the token, freezing it mid-air.  

*"Roar!"***  

Terror flashed in Daoist Snake’s eyes—but it was too late.  

The divine sense struck like thunder, shattering his consciousness. Pain exploded in his mind, scattering his focus and rendering him unable to muster his magic power.  

He bit his tongue, desperate to regain clarity, but before he could react, an excruciating agony tore through his soul—as if something deeply connected to him had been severed.  

*"Ah!"***  

He screamed inwardly, struggling against the encroaching darkness.  

Death loomed mere inches away.  

But the thunderous resonance in his mind left him disoriented, his consciousness adrift.  

"Young friend, cease your attack. The White Flame City forbids killing. Slaying his familiar is punishment enough."  

A hoarse voice rang out, followed by an immense spiritual pressure that halted the battle.  

Daoist Snake’s vision slowly cleared. He touched his neck—blood seeped from a shallow sword wound. A fraction deeper, and his head would have rolled.  

On the ground, the bisected corpse of his snake familiar twitched in its death throes.  

Trembling, he looked up to see the delicate-faced Daoist holding the bounty scroll.  

Standing in the hall was a purple-robed elder, his aura profound—a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Pale-faced, Daoist Snake dared not utter another word. He bowed hastily to the elder before stumbling out of the Hall of Golden Bounties.
