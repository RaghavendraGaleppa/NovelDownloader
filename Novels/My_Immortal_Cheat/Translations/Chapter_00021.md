# Chapter 21: Verification Complete

The atmosphere was incredibly awkward, almost spiraling out of control. Old Man Zhan's arm hung suspended in the air, unsure of what to do. He had already bellowed "come here!"—would cooperating kill him?

He coughed to alleviate the embarrassment, withdrew his arm, and then, his face darkening, addressed Zhou Tian. "Who exactly are you, and what is your purpose?"

Zhou Tian wore a helpless expression. "I really am Zhou Tian; I haven't been possessed. Didn't you want to verify me with that soul lamp? Hurry up and do it." Zhou Tian was quite puzzled by his own transmigration. In his previous life, he had simply been walking along the road when he suddenly transmigrated; he wasn't struck by lightning or hit by a meteor. It just happened. Although he didn't know why, he believed that a mere soul lamp verification shouldn't be able to detect it. Otherwise, what about the millions of fellow transmigrators?

Seeing Zhou Tian's nonchalant attitude, Old Man Zhan and the others secretly pondered: Could he genuinely not be possessed?

"Alright, then come here." After a moment of silence, Old Man Zhan beckoned Zhou Tian closer. Regardless, it was best to verify with the soul lamp first.

"I'm not coming over, you come here!" Zhou Tian stuck his neck out and retorted to Old Man Zhan.

"Why?" Old Man Zhan frowned and asked, his divine sense spreading out. The palace's formations couldn't restrict someone of his cultivation level. He instantly scanned the space around Zhou Tian hundreds of times; there were no traps.

"Nothing. I'm just afraid some people might take advantage and spank my behind." Zhou Tian muttered, his eyes darting towards Zhou Yi, practically naming him directly.

"..." Zhou Yi's face darkened with black lines. This was definitely not his son!

"Alright!" Old Man Zhan nodded and walked towards Zhou Tian, the Lapis Lazuli Golden Lamp floating in his hand.

Zhou Tian remained motionless, waiting. Only when Old Man Zhan approached did he notice that the surface of the Lapis Lazuli Golden Lamp had a transparent protective layer, like glass, etched with incredibly intricate patterns. Golden light, barely visible to the naked eye, flowed across it.

Stopping in front of Zhou Tian, Old Man Zhan held up the Lapis Lazuli Golden Lamp. The golden lamp floated between the two of them, emitting a soft, hazy glow.

Gazing at the golden lamp, a sense of intimacy welled up in Zhou Tian's heart, as if the lamp before him was an extension of his own body. Feeling this sense of kinship, Zhou Tian completely relaxed. Although he had speculated that due to the mysterious reasons of his transmigration, it shouldn't be detected, he had still felt a degree of apprehension. Even if he were detected as not being Zhou Tian, he would have a chance to escape. But his current identity and background were so formidable; a single command was enough for anything. How pleasant! If he ran away, he'd have to handle everything himself, which would be very troublesome. Besides...

Thinking of this, Zhou Tian glanced at Tian Ling, who had long since been knocked unconscious by Emperor Qin. He also had a loli beauty wife here; it would be such a pity to leave.

Ignoring Zhou Tian's rich inner monologue, Old Man Zhan wasted no words. Energy surged, and the golden lamp began to spin rapidly. The outer protective罩 (shield) emitted golden light, and lines of runes appeared.

The soul lamp was crafted from a wisp of innate qi brought from the womb, making it incomparably pure and untainted by external impurities, thus requiring secret arts for its preservation. Initially, the soul lamp's purpose was merely to detect if its owner was alive. Verifying the soul was simply a byproduct. Therefore, the lamp's protective measures were exceedingly complex, needing to be removed step by step. The intricacy of the process was such that even Old Man Zhan, an old master of his cultivation, developed a fine sheen of sweat on his forehead. Zhou Tian watched the fantastical scene before him with unblinking admiration, filled with envy.

He also wished he could soar through the nine heavens, grasp thunder, and control the universe. But alas, he couldn't cultivate. Even if he could, he might not be able to persevere. In the original owner's memories, he had seen those so-called cultivation manuals—what nonsense! They were harder to understand than the *Tao Te Ching*. Why bother cultivating that? His own 'cheat' was much better.

After another period of time, Old Man Zhan finally managed to unravel the protective layer on the outside of the soul lamp. That protective layer transformed into a stream of light and vanished into the void, proving to be not substantial, but rather a complex formation of runes. Now that the rune formation was broken, the protective cover also disappeared.

The moment the protective cover vanished, a wisp of clear qi appeared in Old Man Zhan's hand, enveloping the small flame exposed to the void. Old Man Zhan looked at Zhou Tian and said, "This is made from a w wisp of your innate qi, the very essence of your origin. If you are still Zhou Tian, it will autonomously merge into your soul. There is no harm, and no benefit." The soul lamp was truly wondrous. No matter where you were, if your soul perished, the soul lamp would extinguish. Even those who created the soul lamps couldn't fully explain its principle. Only Zhou Tian's previous life had a theory called "quantum entanglement" that could attempt to explain it somewhat.

"Come on," Zhou Tian said, spreading his arms, a look of nonchalance on his face.

Old Man Zhan, with the flame enveloped in clear qi, brought it closer to Zhou Tian's forehead, slowly dissipating the clear qi. The faint firelight illuminated Zhou Tian's face. As it came into contact with the outside world, tainted by impurities, the flame's glow noticeably weakened.

Zhou Yi and Emperor Qin watched without blinking. Runes swirled in Old Man Zhan's hand, golden light flickered, and a miniature golden spear, only thumb-sized, appeared in his grip, trembling slightly in the void. If there was the slightest anomaly, this spear would pierce Zhou Tian's forehead.

Though the flame was gradually dimming, it continued to move slowly, finally entering Zhou Tian's forehead just before extinguishing completely. Zhou Tian felt nothing, just something entering his soul, and then... it was gone...

A cool breeze swept through the room, which fell into an eerie silence.

Old Man Zhan looked embarrassed. He dispelled the energy spear in his hand and even wiped his hands on his clothes, as if that could conceal the fact that the dazzling golden spear earlier hadn't been conjured by him. Emperor Qin issued a series of commands, and the layers of powerful cultivators surrounding the Hall of Mental Cultivation dispersed, and the formations were also withdrawn!

Zhou Yi, meanwhile, let out a sigh of relief. Thank goodness, thank goodness, he was still his son—even if he really wanted to beat him to death!

Zhou Tian looked around and asked, "Is the verification complete?"

"Haha!" Old Man Zhan burst into laughter, patting Zhou Tian's shoulder. "My Zhou family is truly blessed to have such an outstanding young talent as you!" With that, he vanished directly. The rest was Emperor Qin and Zhou Yi's business; he would only be an awkward presence if he stayed.

As for why Zhou Tian possessed such supernatural abilities, that no longer mattered. As long as it was confirmed that Zhou Tian was still Zhou Tian, and still a member of the Zhou family, that was enough. Perhaps some mighty Dao Lord took a liking to Zhou Tian and bestowed a great fortune upon him! As for the possibility of the soul lamp being inaccurate, such a possibility did not exist. It was made from innate qi; even at the Heavenly Venerate realm, where one's life essence had changed, practically becoming two different life forms, the soul lamp could still distinguish them.
