Chapter 104: The Consequences of Panicked Full Effort

The pine forest was vast, exuding a faint scent of pine resin. The pine needles on the branches were dense, like clusters of emerald-green fine swords. A clear spring gurgled through the forest, and a fiery spring silently expanded, its crimson glow illuminating the green pines, making the scenery here exceptionally beautiful.

However, no one was appreciating the view; the atmosphere was incredibly tense. No one had expected to meet here so unexpectedly, right after entering the spirit cavern.

Li Qingxu, clad in purple, held a purple bamboo staff tempered by celestial light, a calm smile on his face.

It was no longer he who was trapped in a siege. Instead, his opponent, Li Qingyue, was cornered here by him and his acquaintances.

However, those two acquaintances had not yet responded, seemingly also unprepared for such a situation.

Li Qingyue, in silver-white armor, her dark hair fluttering by her ears, said little. She strode directly towards Li Qingxu.

At this moment, she was extremely assertive. Although her figure was as slender as a celestial willow, her aura after donning the armor was incredibly oppressive, unlike her usual demeanor.

Radiant light flowed all over her body, parting the pine branches and vines that blocked her path. The ground seemed to pave a glowing road, extending forward.

"Wang Caiwei won't interfere. You wait here," Li Qingyue secretly transmitted, instructing Qin Ming and the other three golden-armored guards not to follow.

In fact, Qin Ming had already judged that Wang Caiwei probably wouldn't enter the fray.

If she helped Li Qingxu, what would Cui Chong and think once he found out?

Zheng Maoze wanted to wipe away sweat. How could they encounter such an opening? It put him in a difficult position.

Because here, they couldn't kill to silence witnesses. Both Li Qingxu and Li Qingyue, even if severely injured, would definitely be able to escape the spirit cavern eventually. Forcing him to pick a side now would offend someone, no matter which way he went.

From a personal relationship perspective, he had been closer to Li Qingxu these past two years. After all, the latter possessed extraordinary talent and had a terrifying teacher who was extremely protective of his disciples.

However, Li Qingyue's rise was also incredibly rapid; she feared no one when facing them alone.

After some struggle, the slightly stout Zheng Maoze spoke: "We are all old acquaintances, once very close friends. There's no need for swords drawn."

Qin Ming knew this was very much in line with "Zheng Dazhuang's" character; though seemingly rough at first glance, he was actually meticulous.

Zheng Maoze had also judged that Wang Caiwei wouldn't act. He had long known that the Wang family's direct daughter was not simple; for so many years, she had always smiled at people, and he had never seen her lose her temper.

Besides the reason Qin Ming had identified, Zheng Maoze felt there were other reasons to predict she wouldn't enter the fray.

One of them was that Li Qingyue confronting Li Qingxu was precisely because she publicly brought up past events, wanting to stand up for her old acquaintance Qin Ming and settle an old score. Wang Caiwei was also one of the parties involved in the past; no matter what, she had once journeyed with Qin Ming. If she helped Li Qingxu deal with Li Qingyue this time, people might privately say she was cold-hearted.

There was another very important point: Li Qingxu was currently targeted by several core disciples, and his chance of obtaining a near-immortal artifact this time seemed slim.

Li Qingyue, however, had a great deal of hope. If she obtained it, she was destined to become an extremely important figure in the Outer Lands in the future. From a long-term perspective, it was even less advisable to offend her.

Indeed, Wang Caiwei, clad in black armor, revealed a bright yet gentle smile that made one feel as if bathed in a spring breeze.

She mediated, saying, "We were all friends back then. Why have we become estranged after coming to the Outer Lands? If we were to join forces, how powerful would we be? Isn't that better than antagonism?"

Li Qingyue continued to walk, her graceful form glowing. She stepped on the thick pine needles, her silver armor clinking. She smiled at Wang Caiwei and nodded at Zheng Maoze, acknowledging their words and decisions.

Li Qingxu secretly sighed. He had indeed anticipated this situation, but he couldn't bypass Li Qingyue; he inevitably had to fight her.

Actually, Li Qingxu was very strong. Otherwise, Tang Xumi, Jiang Shengyu, and others wouldn't have followed Li Qingyue to target him.

At this moment, his face was impassive. He only glanced at Wang Caiwei, said nothing, and then secretly transmitted a message to Zheng Maoze using a secret art.

"What?!" Zheng Maoze was moved.

Li Qingxu had mentioned his master, that incredibly protective and terrifying senior, who was still in the prime of his life and had many years left to live.

Moreover, Li Qingxu had made a promise to him, something that could immediately boost his strength.

So Zheng Maoze's expression subtly changed. There were benefits to be gained, and most crucially, he was very afraid of that senior. Even millennium families wouldn't want to offend such a figure.

"Qingyue, I apologize, but I have my reasons; I must act. But rest assured, I'm just joining the commotion. I have no intention of truly harming you, nor will I fight a deathmatch," Zheng Maoze secretly transmitted. He was going to enter the fray.

Beside him, He Tai, who had mastered the Great Ape King Energy, was definitely a formidable expert, lauded as a future grandmaster of fist techniques. Even in his nascent stage, he had already slain Outer Saints and was stepping forward.

He Tai was a young powerhouse specially invited by the Millennium Family Zheng, having received significant benefits, so he naturally had to exert his full strength.

Zheng Maoze secretly instructed: "You don't need to follow me into the attack. Block Li Qingyue's four golden-armored guards. Don't be merciless; just hold them back slightly."

Li Qingyue's beautiful face hardened with icy coldness. She looked at He Tai and surprisingly changed direction, heading straight towards him.

Clearly, she was worried that this person would severely injure Qin Ming and the three golden-armored guards, and wanted to resolve him first.

He Tai sensed this, and his Celestial Light energy instantly burst forth. His eyes revealed a wild light, like a Great Ape King emerging, unleashing incredibly terrifying fluctuations. As celestial light swept past, the ancient pines near him cracked open.

"Qingyue, I've instructed He Tai not to truly attack your people. I swear what I say is true," Zheng Maoze quickly transmitted.

He Tai was his trump card. If the two of them teamed up, they might indeed have a slight chance of obtaining the legendary item. They absolutely couldn't fight a deathmatch prematurely.

Li Qingyue's eyes were deep, flowing with mysterious light. She had cultivated Spirit Eyes, allowing her to discern that Zheng Maoze wasn't lying. This time, she said nothing and charged directly at Li Qingxu.

Amidst the forest, multicolored light surged. Bathed in brilliant radiance, she cast aside her elegant, ethereal fairy-like demeanor, now possessing a captivatingly powerful aura.

Li Qingxu smiled. Although he wasn't confident against Li Qingyue, Zheng Maoze siding with him was his biggest advantage.

In a duel between experts, even if one person is unexpectedly slightly stronger, it can change the tide of battle, let alone having the addition of a not-weak Zheng Maoze.

"Li Qingyue, I'm afraid you'll be the first one eliminated!" Li Qingxu laughed.

His hair glowed, and his purple robe billowed. He swung the purple bamboo staff, causing the nearby pine forest to hum and tremble violently. His spiritual consciousness expanded and intertwined, shattering the ancient pines and giant vines in front of him.

Li Qingxu proactively moved to meet Li Qingyue. Even before they truly closed in, their consciousness power and the Light of the Yellow Court already clashed. That battlefield became terrifyingly destructive; centuries-old pine trees exploded, and massive rocks disintegrated.

"Go deal with her golden-armored guards!" Li Qingxu shouted, instructing the four experts behind him.

At the same time, he also looked at Zheng Maoze and his few helpers.

Zheng Maoze braced himself and attacked, then secretly transmitted a message to He Tai again, repeatedly urging him not to get serious and not to kill.

Behind Li Qingxu, among the four golden-armored guards, some fought bare-handed, some wielded heavy weapons like spiked clubs, but the most eye-catching was the golden-armored youth holding a great pike, seemingly having inherited the legacy of an overlord.

Clearly, Li Qingxu's teacher deliberately showed off that even a legacy as formidable as that of the ancient peerless overlord, when learned by someone, merely designated them as a golden-armored guard under him. This was a psychological deterrent.

The four bypassed the core disciples and charged forward, their killing intent shaking the pine forest. Evidently, they were all Outer Saints.

At the critical moment, Li Qingyue broke free from the encirclement of Li Qingxu and Zheng Maoze, rushing towards the four. Instantly, five-colored divine radiance surged, and when the four passed through this area, they suddenly felt as if they were sinking into a quagmire.

"Li Qingyue, you can't interfere!" Li Qingxu said coldly. The purple bamboo staff in his hand, which remained intact despite being tempered by celestial light from beyond the world, emitted a sonic boom as it smashed towards Li Qingyue's back.

At this moment, Qin Ming repeatedly threw flying spears. Four short spears shot through the pine forest, emitting terrifying sounds of wind and thunder, arriving before the four golden-armored guards.

Although the four Outer Saints stumbled, nearly being thrown off their feet by Li Qingyue, they were interfered with by Li Qingxu at the crucial moment, allowing them to break free.

Immediately, celestial light intertwined on their bodies. Either bare-handed or swinging their weapons, they repelled the four short spears Qin Ming threw. With crashing sounds, the spears pierced through nearby thick pine trees.

Qin Ming's expression was solemn. Relying purely on physical strength was clearly not enough to deal with those four. His celestial light couldn't yet be infused into ordinary weapons to leave his body, so the four short spears had no killing power against them.

"Kill!" The two men and one woman who had followed Li Qingyue for over a year had all initially established themselves in the Outer Saint realm. Now they shouted and charged forward, fearlessly engaging their opponents.

Qin Ming, holding his bronze staff, also followed silently, preparing for a major battle!

Seeing Zheng Maoze's four helpers also approaching to encircle Qin Ming and his companions, Li Qingyue took a deep breath. She pushed through the pressure from Li Qingxu and Zheng Maoze, forcibly dragging the two closer to the golden-armored guards' battlefield.

Suddenly, chaos erupted. Core disciples and Outer Saints were all in the same area, making it extremely dangerous.

Qin Ming suddenly accelerated. He truly didn't believe it; with his fusion of over a dozen types of Celestial Light energy bolstering him, could he really not deal with one Outer Saint?

Last time in the desert, he had paid a heavy price to kill one.

Now, he had fused two miraculous techniques, causing his Celestial Light energy to undergo an astonishing transformation and its power to greatly increase. He should have even more confidence now.

With a clang, he swung his bronze staff with all his might, only for it to be... snapped in half by the golden-armored youth's great pike.

Qin Ming's face changed. This was a weapon he had carefully selected from the Red Cloud City armory, forged from mixed gold, not true bronze, yet it was split in two in an instant?

Moreover, he saw the golden-armored youth sneering, his great pike erupting with a foot-long beam of celestial light.

Qin Ming was immediately horrified. This great pike was already two meters long, and the golden-armored youth's celestial light could extend an additional foot beyond it, which was truly astonishing.

One must remember that the Outer Saint he had killed in the desert, despite using all means, couldn't make his celestial light penetrate out of his weapon; it could only leave his body by about half a foot.

Could this golden-armored youth's celestial light extend over two meters from his body? This was truly somewhat terrifying.

At this moment, the golden-armored youth revealed a cruel sneer, slashing diagonally with his great pike, giving his opponent no chance to switch weapons.

Celestial light surged; he intended to blast Qin Ming apart.

Li Qingyue, enduring the pressure from Li Qingxu and Zheng Maoze, arrived nearby to provide aid.

Qin Ming was indeed quite tense. At this moment, going all out, he used his strongest power, raising his fused and unified Celestial Light energy to an unprecedented height.

Li Qingyue's eyes sensed something. She suddenly stopped, a look of surprise on her face, and did not approach further.

Qin Ming parried the great pike with his bare hands, and the weapon didn't break? His heart sank, but his combat awareness was extremely strong. Seeing the golden-armored youth surprised and his movements stiffen, he immediately followed up, pressing close to the pike, and unleashed the strongest Celestial Light energy from his fused Silk Book Method.

The golden-armored youth's heart pounded. What kind of monster was this? He couldn't even externalize his Celestial Light yet, but he could already contend with an Outer Saint bare-handed?

His great pike had some jade-iron incorporated into it, allowing it to channel his celestial light, but just now, the opponent had actually dispelled the celestial light on the pike with a single hand.

Now, he felt a severe crisis. With the opponent so close, he could only temporarily release his great pike, and his hands, like tiger claws, erupted with celestial light to meet the opponent head-on.

"Ah..." The next instant, he screamed. His tiger claw energy disintegrated, his finger bones shattered, flesh and blood flying everywhere. At the same time, his chest was struck by the opponent.

In an instant, his protective golden armor glowed, runes shimmering brilliantly, saving him from certain death once.

Had it not been for that, he would have been blasted apart by the opponent's bare hands.

Qin Ming was still slightly tense. His fused and unified Celestial Light energy continued to burst forth. Unable to penetrate the opponent's runic golden armor, he aimed at the shattered hand.

This terrifying Celestial Light energy could spread along flesh and blood. The golden-armored youth only managed to let out a tragic wail before his entire body exploded into a mist of blood within his glowing armor.

Such a strike shattered the original stalemate on this battlefield.

"This Outer Saint was not worthy of the name; he just looked quite intimidating, and it seems I'm not weak at all," Qin Ming muttered as his tension receded.
