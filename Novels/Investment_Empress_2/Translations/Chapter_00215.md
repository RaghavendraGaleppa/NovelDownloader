# Chapter 215: The Shopkeeper Limited by Poverty, A Gift? The Inner Scene Killer!

“Some见面禮 (jiàn miàn lǐ, meeting gifts), what do you all think?”

Sun Gui stood straight, stroking his chin with a smile.

The Qingyuan Sect was considered a major sect within a single Prefecture, but Yunzhou had three Domains and twenty-seven Prefectures, each no less prosperous than Ziyang Prefecture. The accounts he handled annually were enough to build several sects the size of Qingyuan Sect.

He calculated it very accurately.

The items displayed outside were exactly equivalent to the treasury of a medium-sized sect.

But the main hall was silent.

Qian Bufan: “.....”

Ouyang: “.....”

He scratched his head, calculating how many sets of Li Shidi’s brush, ink, paper, and inkstone those items outside could buy.

Xue Jing: “.....”

Recalling the scene of Little Li pouring out medicinal herbs in a torrent, Old Xue felt completely unphased.

The scene was extremely quiet. An awkward silence.

Sun Gui was baffled. Was the Qingyuan Sect’s foundation far more substantial than he thought? Or were they people of experience, showing no emotion?

That Li Mo was so young; surely he hadn’t seen such a scene before...

“What does Young Hero Li think?”

“I have always viewed money as dirt and have no interest in gold and silver treasures.”

Li Mo smiled politely.

He felt a gaze from behind him.

As is well known, Little Li does not have eyes on his back.

But the time he spent training with his beautiful Master wasn't in vain, was it?

Now it’s useful.

“Please take these gifts back, Shopkeeper Sun.”

Sun Gui’s expression changed. Skilled at reading people, he saw no trace of greed or attachment in Li Mo’s expression.

Was he really a person of noble character, free from lowly interests?

But... people live for something they desire.

It is either fame and fortune, or personal strength and transcendence.

Sun Gui narrowed his eyes and said with a smile:

“In that case, I was being rude.”

“But does Young Hero Li know that my Hengtong Commerce has business routes all over the world? We have all kinds of rare treasures, spiritual pills and elixirs, divine weapons and sharp blades, and secret manuals of supreme martial arts. Even if we don’t have them temporarily, we can find them through connections.”

“Divine weapons?”

“Uh...”

“Do you have sword-type divine weapons?”

Sun Gui’s smile froze on his face.

Most divine weapons are in the hands of Heaven List experts. Even Heaven List experts wouldn't use them lightly; they are usually enshrined in important places like ancestral halls.

“The Commerce can find them, but this is beyond my authority...”

“So it was just an adjective. What about divine arts?”

“.....”

Sun Gui himself only practiced supreme martial arts of the upper grade.

“Do you have pills similar to the Nine Apertures Dragon and Tiger Golden Pill?”

Li Mo asked.

“Ah? What is that?”

Sun Gui was touched on his blind spot of knowledge.

His current situation was a bit like... his imagination being limited by poverty?

Tang Xiaobao scratched his head: “Li Shidi, what he just said seemed to be all adjectives.”

Sun Gui suddenly felt the weather was a bit hot, and sweat was pouring out of him.

He remained silent for a moment to ease the awkwardness:

“Let’s order food first.”

“We can talk in detail while eating... Xiao Er!”

Li Mo said: “Xiao Er is sleeping in the firewood room.”

“Huh?” Sun Gui was stunned, then smiled: “Actually, I am very familiar with the owner here. I can just call him to join us.”

“You mean Shopkeeper Zhang? He should be... on his way back to his hometown right now.” Li Mo pondered.

“He went back? Why so suddenly...”

---

“Naturally, because he sold the restaurant for a good price.”

“Old Zhang once said this restaurant was his life's work. How much money would it take for him to give up this place and go back home peacefully to retire...”

Sun Gui picked up his tea and took a sip.

Li Mo said: “A box of banknotes. A box about your size.”

“A box... of banknotes? What kind of fool...” Sun Gui scanned the surroundings, then asked in confusion: “How does Young Hero Li know so clearly?”

Li Mo pointed at himself expressionlessly:

“Because that fool was me.”

“??”

Sun Gui suddenly understood why Li Mo had no interest in money.

He coughed lightly, his voice becoming much softer:

“Actually, my eldest daughter is very beautiful, knowledgeable, gentle, and quiet. She admires Young Hero Li immensely and should meet your standards for a wife.”

“A rich, beautiful girl, huh, precious disciple.” Shang Wu smiled and nudged Li Mo with her elbow.

Li Mo waved his hand heavily: “I have no interest in young ladies from wealthy families.”

Sun Gui continued: “Then my second daughter, although a bit spoiled, is lively and cute, and loves to roam the world doing chivalrous deeds...”

“The spoiled young lady is the same.”

“My third daughter works in the yamen and is now a captain. She hates evil as much as death.”

“.....Can she help me wipe out the Drizzle Pavilion?”

Little Li’s forehead broke out in black lines.

By the way, Shopkeeper Sun, where did he get so many daughters?

It was quite a headache. He suspected that if he didn't refuse, Shopkeeper Sun wouldn't mind him taking them all...

But he had made his meaning very clear!

Why did he have to accept him as a son-in-law... It's all because of Tian Miao. Whether the 'Prosperous Wife' is true or not, is it necessary to write such an unorthodox thing on the Hidden Dragon List?

“I have no plans to get married for now.” Li Mo said helplessly.

Sun Gui remained silent for a moment and asked: “Then why don't... Young Hero Li try getting to know them one by one? If it happens to be a match, and affection grows over time...”

Li Mo’s eyes were clear and determined: “Impossible, absolutely impossible!”

As soon as he finished speaking.

He felt someone sit next to him.

Ying Bing drank tea as if no one else was around. Her skin was like ice and bones like jade, her nobility unparalleled.

When Sun Gui was swept by her gaze, he suddenly didn't feel hot anymore.

But why was the sweat pouring out even more, unable to stop?

“I appreciate Young Hero Li’s kindness, but please take the gifts back.”

Li Mo took the teacup and took a sip.

Sun Gui was also a man of the world and went along with it:

“A gift given, how can it be taken back.”

“It is worth it for me to have made a good impression with Young Hero Li on this trip.”

He clapped his hands again.

The servants following him brought in another box.

Li Mo noticed that this box was particularly luxurious. Just the material of the box itself was worth about the same as its weight in gold.

“What is this?”

Li Mo asked.

Sun Gui walked to the box in the center of the hall and patted it twice:

“Although it is not a precious item to Young Hero Li, it is something useful.”

He was about to open the box.

However, he suddenly felt a shock in his heart. He looked up and saw that the elders of the Qingyuan Sect opposite him were the same, as if a sudden anomaly had occurred.

It wasn't sudden.

The next moment, the box suddenly exploded.

The domain of the Inner Scene descended instantly.

Pitch black, as if all light vanished in an instant, the restaurant was plunged into thick darkness where one could not see their own hand.

Changing the sky and the sun?

Isn't that the signature martial art of the Evil Ming King?

The name instantly flashed through everyone's mind.

The disciple of the Evil Ming King, rank 73 on the Human List, the 'Silencing All Horses Blade'—Peng Keshan.
