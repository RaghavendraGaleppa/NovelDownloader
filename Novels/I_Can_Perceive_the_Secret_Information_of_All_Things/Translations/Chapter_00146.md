# Chapter 146: The Two Balls from Yuanshen Temple, So It Was You Who Stole Them  

Yuanshen Temple.  

"Has Priest Xiao returned yet?"  

After donating incense money to Yuanshen Temple, Qiuhaitang, a white-robed official exorcist from the Zhenxie Division, lit a stick of incense and asked the two people in the main hall.  

The two were playing chess—an elderly Daoist priest and a woman of extraordinary bearing.  

"Looking for whom?" Liu Haizhu frowned as he glanced at Qiuhaitang.  

Qiuhaitang was momentarily confused. Judging by the old priest's tone, he didn't seem very familiar with Xiao Ji.
