# Chapter 28: The Profound Heaven Devouring Spirit Sword Art

The sect master of Fengyue Sect was deeply astonished.  

The importance of Foundation Establishment Pills needed no elaboration. Under favorable circumstances, a single pill could elevate a disciple to the rank of an Elder with Foundation Establishment cultivation—a status that would make them a revered ancestor in any smaller cultivation family.  

Even among the sect's true disciples, not all were granted a Foundation Establishment Pill. Many had to wait years for such an opportunity. In truth, even a single Foundation Establishment spiritual treasure was invaluable, let alone the pill itself.  

Yet now, the Grand Elder had declared that any true disciple who successfully deciphered the enigmatic treasure would be rewarded with a Foundation Establishment Pill?  

This was unbelievably generous.  

If any disciple succeeded, they would be incredibly fortunate—not only gaining insight into the treasure's secrets but also receiving a Foundation Establishment Pill. Who among the true disciples would be so lucky?  

Still, the sect master mused, even the sect's Foundation Establishment Elders had been stumped by the treasure. The Grand Elder himself likely hadn't fully comprehended it either, given his persistent interest. It was doubtful any disciple possessed such extraordinary fortune.  

Though his thoughts churned, the sect master knew the Grand Elder's decree was final. His duty was merely to carry it out.  

Thus, the elderly man bowed solemnly and replied, "Understood."  

In truth, he felt a pang of regret. If he could have deciphered the treasure—unlocking the very opportunity the Grand Elder sought—perhaps he might have found a path to Core Formation. But reality was unyielding. A pity, truly...  

After a brief report on sect affairs, the elderly man took his leave, leaving the robed youth alone on the cliff.  

Silence returned to the precipice.  

Seated atop a massive boulder, Swordmaster Profound Sword gazed into the distance, his weathered eyes tinged with melancholy.  

As a Core Formation cultivator, he had lived over four centuries. His remaining lifespan was short, and the weight of time pressed heavily upon him.  

Unless he achieved Nascent Soul within the next few decades—extending his life by a millennium—his fate was sealed.  

He had resolved to attempt a breakthrough before his lifespan expired, even knowing the odds were slim. Failure would mean death, but he had little choice.  

Even if he failed, the sect would endure. With a False Core cultivator at its helm, bolstered by the sect's formations and his own preparations, Fengyue Sect would survive, though weakened.  

"...Yet my sword path will perish with me," the robed youth murmured with a sigh.  

The sword art he cultivated was not native to Fengyue Sect. It was an inheritance he had chanced upon during his travels—the **Profound Heaven Devouring Spirit Sword Art**.  

This was no ordinary technique. Swordmaster Profound Sword suspected it might not even originate from this realm.  

Yet, in a sense, it was incomplete.  

He possessed only seven layers of the art: three for Qi Refining, three for Foundation Establishment, and one for Core Formation. Beyond that, there was no further guidance—only a supplementary technique called the **Devouring Spirit Sword Forging Art**.  

According to the supplementary text, the path beyond Core Formation required self-enlightenment. The Devouring Spirit Sword Forging Art was meant to aid in deriving higher realms of the sword path.  

In theory, with this method, one could push beyond Core Formation—even reaching Nascent Soul, Divine Transformation, or unimaginable heights beyond.  

If achieved, this would undoubtedly be a peerless sword art.  

Yet the process was agonizingly difficult.  

Swordmaster Profound Sword was no ordinary talent. His rise from obscurity to his current cultivation proved his genius.  

Yet even he, after relentless effort, had only reached the ninth layer of the Profound Heaven Devouring Spirit Sword Art.  

The tenth layer—the threshold to Nascent Soul—remained beyond his grasp. His soul's strength was insufficient for the derivation. Any attempt risked severe spiritual damage.  

Without the tenth layer, Nascent Soul was impossible.  

Thus, he remained trapped at Core Formation.  

At times, he wondered: had he chosen a different path, might he already be a Nascent Soul cultivator?  

But it was too late to change. His only hope lay in breaking through the sword art's limits.  

Miraculously, he had recently obtained an ancient plant from a secret realm. Though outwardly ordinary, he sensed it concealed a soul-nourishing technique—one that could strengthen divine sense.  

This discovery had thrilled him. If he could enhance his soul's power, perhaps he could finally derive the tenth layer and ascend to Nascent Soul.  

Yet despite his efforts, the plant's secrets eluded him. Even the sect's Foundation Establishment cultivators failed to glean anything from it.  

He theorized that only Nascent Soul-level divine sense could unlock it—a cruel irony. If he already possessed such power, he wouldn't need the technique in the first place.  

In desperation, he extended the opportunity to the sect's true disciples—a last, hopeless gamble.  

Perhaps one among them possessed unique aptitude or extraordinary luck.  

But he held little expectation. This was merely a final act of resignation before he risked everything in a doomed breakthrough attempt.  

"Perhaps this was my destiny from the moment I chose the Profound Heaven Devouring Spirit Sword Art..."  

Swordmaster Profound Sword's whisper faded into the wind.  

And so it was for most cultivators who faced their end at the mercy of an insurmountable bottleneck.
