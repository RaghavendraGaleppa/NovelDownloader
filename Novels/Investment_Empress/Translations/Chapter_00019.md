# Chapter 19: Murong Xiao's Past and Little Li's First Body Tempering

His name was Murong Xiao, and he grew up with his grandfather.

He wasn't always called a genius.

Since childhood, he had scale-like patterns on his body, often leading to him being bullied by other children. Each time he returned from the private academy with a bruised face, his grandfather would say he was too kind and cowardly, not knowing how to fight back when beaten.

But only he knew the truth.

When he was being punched and kicked, what truly frightened him wasn't being unable to win against others, but rather a yearning voice that arose from deep within his heart:

"Hungry."

That's why he dared not fight back. He was afraid that once he saw blood, he would no longer be able to control that hungry self.

As he grew older, that deep-seated hunger gradually faded, but he still maintained his vegetarian habits. Murong Xiao believed he was no different from a normal person.

Until today.

He arrived at the second layer of the Divine Edge Cavern.

"You are a Flood Dragon, a natural great demon, yet you don't consume blood-food?"

"Stop suppressing yourself."

"Return to your true self, and you will never again be bullied by the weak..."

His true nature, suppressed for many years, had never disappeared. It was like a growing pile of dry hay; once ignited, the flames would rage out of control.

Just as Murong Xiao's consciousness was almost dissipating, and scales were nearly covering his cheeks, the next second, someone pried open his mouth and shoved something inside.

It was round.

Before he could taste what it was, it rolled down his throat.

Miraculously, his spiritual platform swiftly regained clarity.

Murong Xiao opened his eyes in a daze, only to see a youth about his age standing before him, handsome and smiling radiantly. In his hand was a porcelain bottle, from which emanated an aroma of pills that was instantly invigorating upon smelling.

He recognized him; it was the youth who, like him, had been accepted as a True Disciple during the Initiation Ceremony.

"You're finally alright." Li Mo let out a sigh of relief. Geez, that was close. In this second layer, there were already few people, and he was the closest to Murong Xiao. If Murong Xiao had been consumed by killing intent, the first target of his attack would likely have been himself.

"Thank you," Murong Xiao whispered his gratitude. No matter how foolish he was, he knew it was the youth before him who had saved him. What he had just consumed must have been some kind of priceless pill. Otherwise, it wouldn't have had such an effect.

"Many thanks for your intervention, Brother Li. I was momentarily careless and was infiltrated by killing intent."

"I'm afraid it wasn't just that, was it?"

"Huh?" Murong Xiao's expression stiffened slightly. He looked up, feeling as if the other party's smiling eyes had already seen right through him.

"Actually, I once read in an ancient text that a half-demon body is usually influenced by its bloodline. The higher the bloodline's grade, the more profound the influence. If not controlled, demonic nature will revive... Your bloodline should be of the Flood Dragon type... Just now, I saw horns growing on your head..."

Li Mo hadn't even finished speaking. Murong Xiao's expression suddenly shifted several times. Finally, his face darkened, as if he had made some sort of decision. Step by step, he slowly walked closer.

Li Mo cautiously took two steps back. Could Murong Xiao have gone insane and was planning to kill him to silence him?

Just as this thought arose, then, *Thud!*

Murong Xiao knelt down decisively. He knelt quite forcefully, even cracking the bluestone bricks on the ground.

"Please, I beg you, don't tell anyone else."

Li Mo: "..."

The Heavenly Fate Divine Eye rated his nature as kind; he really was quite kind. He even suspected that if he were to lean into Murong Xiao's ear right now and whisper, 'You wouldn't want others to know about your half-demon body, would you...?' Then, whatever demand he made, the other party would likely accept.

"Doesn't Elder Han He also know about your half-demon body?" Withdrawing his inner mischievous thoughts, Li Mo asked, puzzled.

Murong Xiao said bitterly: "You also know that everyone in Ziyang Prefecture calls me the 'Kirin Child'... This is actually a lie my grandfather concocted."

After classmate Murong Xiao's explanation, little classmate Li finally understood the reason. The Roaring Flood Dragon is a calamitous beast. Once it appears, it will unleash a bloody storm. Back then, Murong Xiao's father brought back a woman, who was Murong Xiao's mother. The two were married not long after. However, it wasn't until she became pregnant that the old family head of the Murong clan discovered his son was a ruthless character, even more impressive than Xu Xian. Many things happened in between, but Murong Xiao was eventually born safely. The old family head knew that a half-demon body couldn't be concealed, so he simply didn't hide it, instead having people spread rumors in the city. Over time, everyone in Ziyang Prefecture came to believe that Murong Xiao possessed a trace of the Water Kirin bloodline. The Kirin is an auspicious beast. Gradually, Murong Xiao became known as the 'Kirin Child'.

"..." Li Mo was greatly shocked after hearing this. "Your whole family is quite ruthless. Don't worry, I'll keep it a secret."

"But even if I don't say anything, you'll eventually expose yourself."

"Sigh..." Murong Xiao was silent for a long time, then let out a deep sigh. How could he not know? Even if he passed this hurdle today, what about later? As a martial artist, he couldn't possibly be a goodie-two-shoes his entire life.

At this moment, Murong Xiao's eyes suddenly lit up: "By the way, Brother Li, what kind of pill did you just give me?"

"Here, this is called a Tranquil Heart Pill." Li Mo handed him the bottle.

"Tranquil Heart Pill?" Murong Xiao poured one out, examined it, and his eyes dimmed again. "I've taken them before, but they never had such an effect..."

It was indeed a Tranquil Heart Pill. But it was a six-patterned one! A six-patterned pill, even the simplest healing pill, was a rare and highly sought-after treasure, its value far exceeding the pill itself. No wonder the effect was so good... Even with the Murong family's considerable influence in Ziyang Prefecture, such a pill was incredibly difficult to acquire, because even if a pill master managed to refine one, they usually wouldn't put it up for trade.

"Alright, I'm off. I still need to cultivate." At this, Li Mo waved his hand.

"Brother Li, your pills!"

"Just keep them for now. A man's knees are worth gold; consider it compensation for your grand gesture."

"Huh?"

"As for your bloodline matter, I'll go back and check that ancient text. Maybe there's a solution."

"Huh??"

Murong Xiao held the porcelain bottle, kneeling dumbfounded in place. He, too, had grown up with a silver spoon in his mouth, yet this was the first time in his life he felt his imagination was limited by poverty.

No way, big brother. A six-patterned pill! And not just one, but a whole bottle! He didn't even know how much this was worth, because in the hands of someone who needed it, it was a priceless treasure.

Classmate Murong suddenly felt a bit of regret. Since he had already knelt, he should have kowtowed a couple more times.

Murong Xiao wanted to chase after him, at least to say a few more words of thanks. But he had only taken a few steps before stopping, because he realized that he seemingly couldn't proceed any further to where Li Mo was going.

"Brother Li, Brother Li Mo!"

"That's the third layer!" Murong Xiao's voice echoed through the cavern. With his own physical strength, he could only reach the middle section of the second layer.

Blood Qi Realm, descending to the third layer of the Divine Edge Cavern? Just thinking about it was horrifying!

"No, Brother Li just saved me, I absolutely cannot let anything happen to him! If I can't go to the third layer, then I can only go beg Master..." Murong Xiao scrambled to his feet. He swiftly ran towards the entrance of the Divine Edge Cavern.

Meanwhile, a certain little classmate Li was completely unaware of this matter. As he walked, he saw a message from the system:

[You have an uncollected investment feedback. Do you wish to collect it?]

"No."

Li Mo stepped into the third layer, fully concentrated. Looking up, various weapons were sparsely embedded in the mountain walls. These weapons had all once belonged to Inner Realm experts. Looking at them was like seeing the past lives of their famous owners—seeing them pierce into others' bodies, held by their masters, locked in life-and-death struggles with enemies. Similarly, the sharp killing intent they emitted was many times stronger!

Perhaps there were still people on this layer, but at least they weren't within Li Mo's field of vision.

"This should be far enough," he mused. "If I go any further, even with my Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body, it would be dangerous."

Li Mo found a bluestone and sat down. He first took out a gourd and chugged two mouthfuls of Icefire Wine. Upon entering the mouth, it was like a secluded mountain spring, refreshing and cool. But once it entered his stomach, it seemed to ignite, making every inch of his meridians, fascia, and even bones burn with heat.

"Let's begin!" Li Mo exhaled a breath of wine, then chewed and swallowed the Tranquil Heart Pill.

Circulating his cultivation technique, as the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body began to operate, the sharp killing intent from the weapons washed over his body.

Pain! Fine beads of sweat trickled down Li Mo's forehead; he gritted his teeth and persevered. He felt his muscles were like unpolished stones being constantly ground, gradually revealing their inner jade-like luster, becoming increasingly tough. And the potency of the Icefire Wine acted as a lubricant, enhancing the tempering effect while also promoting muscle restructuring. Sweat drenched his clothes, and white steam rose from his head. Little classmate Li vividly experienced just how painful body tempering truly was.

But, he had already started. After a brief probing, he began to incorporate his meridians into the tempering process.

Buzz—

Just as Li Mo was cultivating, the weapons embedded in the stone wall seemed to sense something, all beginning to vibrate continuously.
