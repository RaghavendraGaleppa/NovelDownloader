# Chapter 8: Cultivation Techniques  

Upon reaching the fifth floor, Han Yue found the atmosphere completely transformed. The furnishings were more refined, exuding an air of elegance.  

The layout here no longer resembled a typical shop but rather consisted of private tea rooms designed for discreet conversations. Far fewer guests frequented this level, each being ushered into individual tea rooms for detailed discussions.  

The exchange of knowledge and information demanded the utmost confidentiality, and the merchant house had arranged everything with impeccable professionalism. Han Yue couldn’t help but admire their expertise in conducting business.  

Shortly after entering their assigned tea room, a scholarly middle-aged man walked in. With a polite smile, he greeted them, "Welcome, honored guests. I am Tang Xian, one of the overseers of the fifth floor. Please, make yourselves comfortable."  

Tang Xian prepared a pot of tea and said, "Please try our merchant house’s new tea—Huanghao Silver Peak. Its flavor is quite exquisite."  

Han Yue and his companion obliged, and the atmosphere quickly grew more relaxed.  

Tang Xian then inquired, "What might you be seeking today? While our merchant house may not be the strongest in cultivation techniques, we can still meet most needs."  

Han Yue spoke first, "Mr. Tang, could you explain how knowledge and information are priced and sold here?"  

"Of course!" Tang Xian replied. "Our fifth-floor inventory is divided into three main categories."  

"The first consists of verified cultivation techniques and knowledge. These are expensive, but we guarantee their accuracy. Many of these techniques have historical records of successful practitioners, with verifiable sources."  

"The second category includes consigned, brokered, or unverified techniques and knowledge. These are more affordable and abundant, though their value depends greatly on the buyer’s discernment."  

"The third category comprises non-cultivation-related knowledge, which is significantly cheaper."  

With that, Tang Xian had three catalogs brought over.  

Han Yue examined them carefully.  

The first, a jade catalog, listed thirteen high-grade cultivation techniques, each priced at over ten thousand merchant coins—far beyond Han Yue’s current means. Moreover, the techniques listed often came with significant restrictions. After a brief glance, he set it aside.  

The second, a bronze catalog, contained over three hundred entries, each priced at 500 merchant coins. The sheer volume made selection daunting.  

The third, a paper catalog, was the thickest, resembling a hefty book. Han Yue focused intently on this one, meticulously reviewing its contents.  

After nearly two hours, he finally looked up.  

"My apologies for the wait, Mr. Tang. I’ve made my choice: *An Introduction to Runic Script* and *On Primordial Qi*."  

The two books totaled exactly 80 merchant coins, perfectly matching the budget provided by Fang Yi.  

Tang Xian smiled approvingly. "Excellent choices. These texts originate from renowned inland sects. While they don’t directly enhance strength, they are invaluable for broadening one’s understanding."  

"Here in Fenrouji, most prioritize hunting demonic beasts and gaining power. Few take the time to study such materials."  

After retrieving the books, Tang Xian handed them to Han Yue, concluding their transaction. Having achieved his primary objective, Han Yue bid farewell and returned to Courtyard Nine with his companion.  

On the way back, Xiao Liu couldn’t help but ask, "Brother Dao, what’s the use of these books? For the same price, we could’ve bought ten sets of the merchant house’s Bone-Tempering Elixir—enough to significantly boost our physical strength."  

Han Yue chuckled and countered, "Does our courtyard have any books to read?"  

Xiao Liu thought for a moment. "My father mentioned that a few generations ago, one of our past leaders spent a fortune on a technique from the jade catalog. But no one in our courtyard ever managed to master it."  

"That manual must still be around. I’ll ask the leader to lend it to you."  

Upon returning to his quarters, Xiao Liu soon delivered the promised manual.  

Now, Han Yue had seven books in his possession: the two newly purchased, the one from Xiao Liu, and four seized from the City Lord’s residence. The latter five were all written in runic script.  

Though he had possessed these texts for some time, deciphering them had been a challenge due to the runic script. With *An Introduction to Runic Script*, Han Yue could finally attempt translation.  

For the next several days, Han Yue remained indoors, devoting himself to translating the texts—pausing only to consume demonic beast organs for sustenance.  

The manual Xiao Liu provided was titled *Bloodhand Art*, a technique requiring the absorption of demonic beast blood-qi. Practitioners could channel this qi into their hands, altering their physiological structure to manifest the *Bloodhand* supernatural ability. Mastery of this technique could elevate a cultivator to the second rank.  

However, such techniques held little appeal for Han Yue. Not only did they rely on demonic beast blood-qi, but they also induced bodily mutations—something he wished to avoid.  

Three of the remaining four books followed similar principles, so Han Yue set them aside.  

Only the last one held his full attention:  

*Thunder Nurturing Art*  

A foundational cultivation technique designed for those who had absorbed thunderforce.  

Though concise—barely a few hundred characters—the text was profound, detailing how to harness thunderforce to forge a runic seal within the dantian. Once mastered, this seal could temper the body and spontaneously generate thunderforce.  

This was precisely the foundational technique Han Yue needed.  

He exhaled in relief—his efforts had not been in vain. He had finally found the key to converting his resources into tangible power.  

The thunderforce within Han Yue originated from his supernatural ability, *Thoughtless Slash*, which was of an exceptionally high rank. According to *On Primordial Qi*, while different forms of qi had affinities and conflicts, none were inherently stronger than others. Any type could be cultivated to higher ranks.  

In other words, a second-rank cultivator who absorbed demonic beast blood-qi was no weaker than one who wielded thunderforce.  

However, natural qi manifestations were typically third-rank or higher. Absorbing natural qi often accelerated cultivation, allowing practitioners to allocate more time to refining supernatural abilities, tempering their bodies, or crafting magical artifacts—resulting in greater combat prowess.  

But those who absorbed the power of high-ranking demonic beasts stood on an entirely different plane.  

By advancing to the Body Integration realm through *Thoughtless Slash*, Han Yue had already gained a significant advantage over ordinary cultivators.
