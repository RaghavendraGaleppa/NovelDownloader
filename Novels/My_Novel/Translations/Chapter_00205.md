Chapter 205: The Dragon Appreciation Banquet Begins, A Vast World

Guest Hall.

Madam Wen walked forward with graceful steps, wearing a fox-fur cloak over her white robe. Li Bohou caught sight of her from the corner of his eye and lightly raised his right hand. Li Haitang felt an invisible force lifting her, and she stood up.

Li Bohou abandoned his previous modest and casual demeanor. Cupping his hands, he said, "Madam Wen, I trust you have been well since we last met."

Madam Wen took the host’s seat and nodded slightly. Her gaze swept over the two of them as she said softly, "Please sit, Divine Catch Li. Do not stand on ceremony. Haitang, you may sit as well."

Her words were intimate, like a loving elder speaking to Haitang. Flattered and somewhat overwhelmed, Li Haitang sat down quietly.

Madam Wen apologized, "I am truly sorry. I was in seclusion for cultivation and found it difficult to break away. That is why I kept you waiting for so long. I had Xiao Xian entertain you; I hope he did not neglect you. If there were any shortcomings, please speak plainly. I will certainly punish him."

"Not at all, not at all," Li Bohou laughed. "Young Li handles matters thoroughly, and we conversed pleasantly. Staying in the manor for a few days has been quite relaxing and comfortable."

Madam Wen smiled. "If that is the case, it is for the best. Haitang, how have you been lately? Did you catch the Immortal of the Altar?"

Li Haitang said, "I am truly ashamed. My learning is shallow, and I lost track of him. I failed to capture that vicious criminal."

Madam Wen said, "One success or failure does not determine a hero. You are still inexperienced; suffering a setback is good for you."

"Yes, I will heed your teachings!" Li Haitang replied respectfully.

"Your father is the famous Divine Catch; what need is there for me to teach you? I am merely an elder sharing a bit of experience. The word 'teaching' is too much for me to claim."

Wen Caishang paused, then got straight to the point. "Divine Catch Li mentioned that there is a matter concerning the Dragon Appreciation Banquet? Please speak plainly."

Li Bohou’s expression turned solemn. He tapped the armrest lightly with his fingers and said, "The Dragon Appreciation Banquet is about to begin. It should be... in the second month of this year. It is now the end of the twelfth month; it is time to set off!"

"Oh?" Madam Wen looked into the distance, contemplating for a moment. "Calculating the time, it indeed should be soon. This grand banquet is truly hard to predict whether it brings fortune or disaster."

She took a light sip of tea.

Li Bohou said, "There is another matter I need to inform Madam of."

Madam Wen said, "Please, speak."

"This matter is quite a coincidence."

Li Bohou said, "Some time ago, I pursued the criminal on the Red List, the 'Zither Demon.' Although I unfortunately let him escape, during the pursuit, I happened to uncover some secret information that is greatly related to you. At this Dragon Appreciation Banquet, someone intends to target you."

"The Taixin Sect, the Jianyu Tower, the Shiluo Village... many sects are preparing a great scheme, and it seems to concern you. I came specifically to warn you; I hope Madam will be extra careful. Do not fall into the hands of these villains."

Upon hearing this, Madam Wen frowned slightly. She thought to herself, *These sect forces all have experts backing them; they are certainly not comparable to the people of the prefecture city. I have killed many of their disciples in the past, creating deep grudges. It is expected that they would use this Dragon Appreciation Banquet to target me. But for them to actually unite... I must prepare early.*

She smiled and said, "So that is the case. Divine Catch Li has traveled a thousand miles to deliver this message; Caishang is immensely grateful. I have received this information and will certainly be on guard."

Li Bohou nodded. He pulled Li Haitang to his side and said, "That is all I had to say. Originally, since Young Li and Madam are close, I could have had him convey the message. But upon careful thought, this matter concerns life and death. Only by speaking face-to-face can I show respect and ensure Madam takes it seriously."

"I have heard that Madam is as beautiful as a fairy. Seeing you today, it is indeed true. conversing with Madam is like hearing a celestial melody; it is truly wonderful. Unfortunately, I have urgent matters to attend to and must take my leave first."

Madam Wen sneered inwardly: *He speaks sweetly, but he is merely trying to distance himself from me. He traveled a thousand miles to tell me of hidden dangers. It is just to clear his daughter's relationship with me in advance, so she won't be牵连 (involved). Do you think I can't see through this? Fine. You are just a hunter in the Jianghu; how could you risk your life for me?*

She knew Li Bohou’s intention to leave was firm. Pretending to persuade him to stay, she said softly, "Divine Catch Li, why the hurry? Why not stay a few more days? The gardens in my manor are unique. How about I personally accompany you two for a few days of sightseeing?"

*For you to accompany me personally, I certainly do not have the fortune to enjoy that,* Li Bohou thought to himself. He said, "It is truly not convenient. I must leave now. I hope Madam will not take offense." He gestured to Li Haitang and walked out. With a single step, he covered several zhangs. The flowers and grass under his feet were lush, as if it were early spring.

In the blink of an eye, they were already far away.

Madam Wen said coldly, "Haha. He is so afraid of being牵连 with me that he even used the 'Step of Three Springs'."

She turned to look at Li Xian, her voice softening instantly. "Xiao Xian, what do you think? Did you hear that? This Dragon Appreciation Banquet is fraught with danger. Are you still willing to go?"

"If I can go and share your burden, I would ask for nothing better," Li Xian said loudly.

"Good, good," Madam Wen patted the back of Li Xian's hand, delighted. "If all the men in the world were like you, that would be wonderful. But such a good man is unique, and now he is in my hands. Rest assured, those petty villains are no match for me. No matter how many there are, it is futile."

The Dragon Appreciation Banquet arrived suddenly, forcing the trip to the Southern Frontier to be abandoned.

The next day.

Uncle Xiang, responsible for handling the various matters of the Southern Frontier trip, quickly learned of the situation. Entering the inner court and requesting an audience with Madam, after understanding the general situation, he said nervously, "Madam, this trip is fraught with danger. Have you considered not going?"

Madam Wen was tending to potted plants, pruning flowers, and said impatiently, "Whether I go or not is my decision. There is no need for you to meddle."

"If it were any other matter, I would certainly obey Madam. But this is dangerous. Madam has no heirs. If an accident were to happen..." Uncle Xiang broke out in a cold sweat, pressing his head to the ground. He felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles as Madam's gaze fixed upon him, radiating a chilling coldness.

Madam Wen said softly, "If I told you that this Dragon Appreciation Banquet concerns an important ingredient in my recipe?"

Uncle Xiang’s expression changed. He said sincerely, "Then this old servant is willing to give his life to clear the path."

"Rise," Madam Wen said. "What use is your life to me? Just watch over the manor and keep things running as usual. Oh, hide away some precious items."

"After the Dragon Appreciation Banquet ends, we will have to move to a new location. This Qingning County... we do not need to stay here for long."

Wu Wei Hall.

Li Xian vaguely understood the gravity of the matter.

"Madam settling in Qingning County... could it be that she was waiting for this Dragon Appreciation Banquet?"

Madam Wen had many industries. In several large counties, she owned clothing shops, restaurants, cosmetics shops, and wine cellars. Uncle Xiang told Li Xian to visit the various families and sell off the industries conveniently.

Li Xian knew that Madam Wen had lived in Qingning for a long time but had no deep feelings for this place. Once the Dragon Appreciation Banquet was over, the manor would likely migrate.

At that time... he would also need to follow her and leave. Li Xiaofan was traveling for study and was not in Qingning. Although Li Xian had some attachment to Qingning, it was not difficult to part with.

If there was anything he was reluctant to part with, it was the Wu Wei Hall. Li Xian subtly expressed that he might be leaving Qingning. Everyone was reluctant to see him go.

By Qingning Lake. Li Xian and Luo Xia were strolling.

Li Xian said, "Luo Xia, in the future, these brothers will have to be entrusted to you."

"You are really leaving?" Luo Xia asked.

"I'm not sure, but I have a feeling," Li Xian said. "After the Dragon Appreciation Banquet... perhaps it won't be long before we leave. Or perhaps... this Dragon Appreciation Banquet is very unusual.总之 (In short), it is hard to say."

He teased further, "Once I am gone, you will be the Wu Wei Zheng Lang."

Luo Xia rolled her eyes. "Do you think I covet that position?"

Li Xian said, "I have some industries in the city. I will hand them over to you for management when the time comes. Also..."

"The industries of Yi He Manor are up for sale. I am handling the transaction and can select some excellent assets to transfer to my name. I will give you a list later; you must manage them well."

"Let the brothers eat some good, spicy, and fragrant food."

Luo Xia sighed. The Dragon Appreciation Banquet brings shifting winds and clouds. Matters are unpredictable; why think too far ahead?

They returned to the hall to train the various officers. Li Xian sensed the convergence of winds and clouds but remained calm and unyielding, silently honing his martial arts.

"The road ahead is perilous; martial arts are my companion. I started as a servant, and now I possess some strength. The Immortal of the Altar, the Black River Village, Xu Lifeng... obstacles and dangers have been constant. Yet, I have walked through them all."

"This Dragon Appreciation Banquet... though my strength is lowly, I will still play a part. Before the banquet has even begun, I already sense layers of danger. Madam's strength is formidable; I have yet to see anyone who is her match. But there are always higher mountains, and there is always a sky beyond the sky..."

"Although it is difficult to improve my strength significantly in the short term, whether it is wind blades or frost swords, the road ahead is uncertain, but I will walk it without hesitation!"

[Proficiency +1]

Li Xian practiced martial arts diligently, accumulated internal energy, digested precious elixirs, and comprehended the essence of techniques.

The road ahead is unpredictable, but he walks on with composure.

Madam Wen remained indifferent, practicing as usual and waiting for the opportunity. Li Xian helped sell the industries and earned a considerable amount of money.

Madam's industries were top-tier at generating wealth and had long been coveted by families in various counties. Selling them was not a problem. Li Xian earned the difference, making a fortune every day.

He had never possessed so much silver before. But it would not stay for long before flowing out again. He used the money to buy some restaurants, wine shops, cosmetic shops, and clothing stores that were doing very well.

He left them for Luo Xia to manage. After all... he was not leaving forever.

In this way, Li Xian had industries established in Huangyu, Qingning, Ziqiong... and several other counties. His financial power and influence were among the best in the area.

With the extra money.

Li Xian entrusted others to purchase poisons, poisoned darts, and many other hidden weapons. Walking the Jianghu, one relies on oneself the most.

He also purchased geographical maps.

Memorizing the terrain, mountain ranges, and river systems along the way in advance. Li Xian thought to himself: *In case, just in case, an accident occurs, if I do this, and then that... can I hold my own against an enemy?*

"I have no lightness skill, but my accumulation of martial arts is no longer shallow. According to Madam, the previous trip to the prefecture city was just child's play. Why is the Poor Heavenly Prefecture called 'Poor'? It is because of the word 'Poor.' Although to me, this Poor Heavenly Prefecture is already wealthy, looking at the Yu Nan Dao... it is poor and remote."

"This Dragon Appreciation Banquet is truly a glimpse into a corner of the Jianghu."

Great Martial Empire.

Southern Heaven Domain.

At the intersection of Yu Nan Dao and Longxiong Dao, there is an old dragon pool with dark and cold water.

Dozens of miles away from the pool, there is a rushing great river. It is called the "Blossoming River."

It originates from the [Yangchun Prefecture] in the west of Yu Nan Dao, stretching forty-nine thousand miles, passing through Yu Nan and Longxiong as it rushes toward the sea.

Deep within the pool.

A python raises its head.

On the second day of the second month, it will leave the river to become a dragon, and heroes will gather. The Dragon Appreciators will help the python traverse the water into the sea, transforming into a dragon. The Dragon Slayers will block and kill it along the river!

The Dragon Appreciation Banquet... there is no banquet and no dishes, but there is a real dragon!
