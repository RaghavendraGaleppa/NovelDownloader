# Chapter 38: The Moon Surrounded by Stars, The Ice Cube: "I'm Not Jealous at All"

At this moment.

The Clear Abyss Sect undoubtedly became the most dazzling existence within the Purple Sun Mansion. The multicolored radiance almost stole the brilliance of the bright moon in the sky.

**Purple Sun Mansion City.**

Inside an antique-style room.

An elder dressed in luxurious clothing had his feet resting in the laps of two young servant girls for warmth when he suddenly noticed the color of the window gauze change.

He slowly rose and asked, "Why is the outside so brilliantly lit with multicolored light?"

"Replying to the Mansion Master, it is coming from the direction of the Clear Abyss Sect."

"Clear Abyss..."

The elder fell into a pensive silence, his expression shifting multiple times.

"Write a letter and invite Elder Yin Hua of the Rare Beast Peak to the Mansion for a visit."

"Yes..."

The steward acknowledged the order but seemed to have something else to say.

"Hmm? Speak if you have something to say."

"Princess Chulong... she is missing."

After the steward finished speaking, he was already sweating profusely, not daring to look at his master's expression.

After a long while, a deep and chilling voice came:

"Dig three feet into the ground if you must; bring her back no matter what."

"Yes."

***

**Biluo Lake.**

A ship as massive as a mountain stood upon the river waters, its size not much smaller than the surrounding islands.

Black flags fluttered in the wind, inscribed with powerful, hook-like characters:

**[Red Whale Ship]**

The Red Whale Gang, one of the three major sects of the Purple Sun Mansion, was ostensibly the weakest of the three. However, its members were a mix of all sorts of people from all walks of life, claiming to have a strength of one hundred thousand. Behind the scenes, countless martial forces were entangled with it.

A burly, bearded man stood at the bow of the ship, hands behind his back, gazing into the distance.

"Did the Clear Abyss Sect discover a strange treasure, or did some kind of inheritance open?"

"Big Boss, I believe it is the latter."

A pale-faced, beardless youth spoke from behind.

Strangely enough, despite being the leader of the Red Whale Gang and an Outer Scene Realm expert, the bearded man did not doubt or refute the youth's words.

"The Clear Abyss Sect has a long history, yet it still possesses an inheritance appearing in the world."

"This inheritance must be extraordinary."

"Those qualified to receive it must be geniuses of heaven. I'm afraid they have the potential to enter the Hidden Dragon List?" the bearded man said in a deep voice.

He had always wanted to elevate the Red Whale Gang under his leadership to a higher level, replacing the Clear Abyss Sect as the number one force.

This was highly possible.

After all, Shangwen Cang was already old.

"With me here, what does it matter if one or two monsters appear in this small Purple Sun Mansion? Can they compare to me?"

The youth in a red robe licked the corners of his mouth.

"What the前辈 says is right." The worry in the Red Whale Gang Leader's eyes vanished.

***

**North Dark Domain.**

On a toweringly high mountain peak, a tower of a hundred stories was built, seemingly reaching high enough to touch the sky.

**Heavenly Derivation Sect.**

The world-famous Hidden Dragon List, as well as the Heaven, Earth, and Human lists, all originated from here.

On the Star Observing Platform at the top of the tower.

A silver-haired elder maintained a posture of looking up at the sky,不知 how long she had been standing there.

Suddenly, the corner of her eye twitched, and her aged voice muttered to herself, "The stars are in disarray, the Taiyin star is flourishing, yet why is it all chaotic again?"

She took out a jade plate from her怀里, on which countless thumbnail-sized jade pieces were slowly sliding.

As she channeled her energy into it, the speed of the jade pieces' movement increased.

Suddenly, it jammed abruptly, and the entire jade plate dimmed.

Simultaneously, the elder's face also dimmed.

"Cough, cough, cough..."

"Master, what is wrong?"

"Yinghuo... Yinghuo..."

"Are you referring to what the Founder recorded, the chaos of the Yinghuo (Mars)?"

The elder let out a long sigh, her pale old face appearing even more aged.

The beautiful young girl bit her lip, her heart in turmoil.

The Heavenly Derivation Sect knows the will of heaven, observes the rise and fall of dynasties, and even pushes the tide from behind the scenes.

This includes the founding of the Great Yu Dynasty and the ascension of the Martial Emperor.

The chaos of Yinghuo represents one thing.

The Heavenly Derivation Sect will be unable to see the heavenly secrets.

"Master, the Crown Prince requests an audience."

Another disciple stepped forward to report.

"Tell him this old woman will not help her find Princess Chulong, nor can I find her."

***

**Clear Abyss Sect.**

With such a major event occurring, the sect's trial was naturally terminated early.

Mainly, throughout the entire Clear Abyss Mountain Range, wherever the multicolored light shone, strange beasts, regardless of strength, scrambled to flee, or even lay on the ground trembling.

Continuing the trial would be meaningless.

**Moon Gazing Cliff.**

A thin, elderly man walked to the edge of the cliff.

Shangwen Cang was still wearing that gray linen robe, looking more like a neighboring old farmer than the leader of a sect.

"Sect Master."

---

"Sect Master."

The elders snapped out of their shock one after another.

"How long has it been since Ying Bing and Li Mo fell into the Clear Abyss?" Shangwen Cang asked softly.

"About two hours."

Xue Jing's brow was now completely free of worry: "Sect Master, the two of them must have entered a secret area of the Clear Abyss, and... they have likely already taken the inheritance into their hands."

"I... I also think so."

Cold Crane's expression was very interesting.

It wasn't that Cold Crane's temper was bad; the expressions of the other elders weren't much calmer either.

Since the founding of the Clear Abyss Sect, no one had ever seen the true appearance of this opportunity.

The radiant light, shining upon heaven and earth.

This is an inheritance that even they would have difficulty imagining!

The only doubt is who exactly obtained the opportunity...

Ying Bing?

Or...

"Hahaha, my precious disciple really makes me proud."

Shang Wu stood with hands on her hips, her apricot eyes reflecting the sparkling radiance: "My disciple got the inheritance, he will definitely be the Sect Master in the future."

"He became the Sect Master, and I will be the Grand Elder."

"Then I can spend the sect's money however I want."

"Hehe... hehehe..."

Shang Wu wiped the corner of her mouth, extremely happy.

The Elders: "..."

Miss, we don't even know who the inheritance will go to yet.

And our Sect Master is still alive, and you're already planning how to stir up trouble in the future?

If Shang Wu became the Grand Elder...

Everyone took a cold breath in unison.

Qian Bufan said righteously, "The Sect Master needs the approval of the peak elders to use internal resources."

"I think, the possibility of that little girl Ying Bing obtaining the inheritance is greater," Elder Cold Crane said.

Elder of Falling霞 Peak also nodded: "That cry just now, it should have been female."

Shang Wu: "?"

You can tell the gender from the sound?

Xue Jing was both amused and exasperated: "It's also possible that the inheritance was obtained by both of them."

The multicolored light finally filled the entire Clear Abyss.

The young man and woman set foot on the Moon Gazing Cliff again.

Li Mo had a bright and satisfied smile.

Ying Bing's brow flickered faintly, adding a touch of divinity to her peerless beauty.

However...

Li Mo's smile was just too bright.

For a moment, the crowd really couldn't tell who the opportunity had fallen to.

"Where is the inheritance?"

Shang Wu quickly arrived in front of Li Mo, looking him up and down, even sniffing him with her delicate nose.

"It's not with me," Li Mo said, spreading his hands.

"Then why are you smiling so broadly?"

"???"

Not with Li Mo?

Everyone turned their gaze to Ying Bing.

"This disciple did indeed obtain an inheritance, and it is extremely ancient," Ying Bing nodded.

She knew the origin of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix.

But in everyone's eyes, she should be receiving an inheritance for the first time and shouldn't be so familiar with its origins.

Of course, this didn't affect the elders' shock.

Because of two words: ancient.

It is not advisable to praise the past and belittle the present. For example, martial techniques may be innovated by later generations.

But an inheritance is absolutely more valuable the older it is.

If it didn't have a background, it would have been lost in the river of time long ago; how could it have been passed down until now.

"Our Clear Abyss Sect is probably going to produce a monster capable of entering the Hidden Dragon List."

"The history of the Clear Abyss is long and profound, yet countless people have explored it without finding anything. Who would have thought that in our lifetime, we would see this inheritance see the light of day again."

"Exceptional talent, accompanied by great fortune. Ying Bing's future achievements are unimaginable!"

...

Everyone couldn't hide their emotion and excitement.

Being looked upon like precious treasures by the elders.

Ying Bing herself bit her lips, instead turning her gaze toward the young man not far away.

She saw him smiling even more happily.

【Congratulations to the host, the investment in Ying Bing was successful, granting her a major inheritance in her life.】

【Is the reward to be claimed?】

The Ice Cube was surrounded by stars, but Student Li wasn't the least bit jealous.

Because just now, he received the investment feedback from the system.

If it weren't inconvenient right now, he couldn't help but claim it immediately.

"I'll claim it when I get back... I'll claim it when I get back..."

Li Mo rubbed his hands, wishing he could return to Autumn Water Pavilion immediately.

At this moment, Shangwen Cang finally spoke slowly:

"Alright, Ying Bing, your opportunity is yours to handle. Anyone who asks about it, you do not need to say a word."

"From today on, Moon Gazing Cliff is sealed off."
