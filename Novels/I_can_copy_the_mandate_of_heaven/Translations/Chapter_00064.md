#64, Martial Arts Master!

As the years passed, the tranquility of the Seven Mystic Gate was disrupted by increasingly frequent conflicts, and the number of patients sent to the Medicine Valley grew daily. Li Zhiming's days became busier, as he treated injuries ranging from ordinary disciples to elders and even peak-level figures.

Within a year, Li Zhiming had treated countless wounded individuals, and miraculously, not a single patient died under his care in the Medicine Valley. His exceptional skills earned him a reputation throughout the Seven Mystic Gate, and his name became synonymous with excellence in medicine.

As his fame spread beyond the sect, people began to refer to him as a "little divine doctor." The side hall was filled to capacity with patients, and Li Zhiming's workload was so heavy that he was on the verge of exhaustion. To alleviate the burden, the Seven Mystic Gate dispatched over a hundred medical practitioners to assist him.

A year later, Li Zhiming reached the age of fourteen, as foretold by his original fate. The Medicine Valley, once bustling with activity, fell silent. The conflicts between the Seven Mystic Gate and external forces seemed to have ceased, and the influx of wounded patients came to an abrupt halt.

As the last batch of patients left the side hall, the Medicine Valley returned to its usual tranquility. Outside the hall, a lanky, refined-looking teenager with a height of over seven feet crouched down, making "zi zi zi" sounds to entice a fruit fox. The fox, now fully grown, had a shiny coat, with a white face and neck, and black body and claws. Its thick tail swished back and forth as it ran towards Li Zhiming, its paws resting on his knees.

"You're acting like a dog again!" Li Zhiming exclaimed, tapping the fox's head and ruffling its thick fur. "Who taught you this?"

The fox yelped in response, its tail wagging furiously.

"You know, I've been thinking," Li Zhiming said, "when that sturdy uncle comes, he might just stew you. I've seen the way he looks at you, drooling all over the place."

The fox let out a series of indignant yips and squeaks, protesting Li Zhiming's teasing.

As Li Zhiming strolled through the Medicine Valley, cradling the fruit fox in his arms, he couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment. The valley was now empty, with everyone, including the females and Han Li, having gone elsewhere.

As he walked to the entrance of the Medicine Valley, Li Zhiming gazed up at the sky, lost in thought. "I'm fourteen now," he murmured.

It seemed like just a moment ago that he had arrived at the Medicine Valley, and now, several years had passed in the blink of an eye. The memories of his past were starting to fade, including the image of his master.

Li Zhiming recalled the first time he saw his fate, the black, worm-like text that emerged from his head: "Early Demise at Fourteen."

"Does that mean I'll die this year?" Li Zhiming wondered, pondering the possibility that his fate had changed.

As he stood at the entrance, bathed in sunlight, Li Zhiming gazed up at his head, and a different sight met his eyes. His fate had transformed into "Martial Arts Master," with a list of skills and abilities that seemed endless.

Skills: Scholar, Farmer Level 5, Blacksmith Level 5, Tailor Level 5, Healing Max, Magical Silver Hand Max, Confined Dragon Hand Max, Luo Smoke Step Max, Dark冥刀法 Max, Great Power Golden Fist Max, Venomous Snake Breath Max, Eight Trigrams Cloud Splitting Palm Max, Buddha Hand Max, Jade Breaking Fist Max, Demonic Hand Max, White Cloud Emerging from the Mountains Max, White Crane Soaring to the Heavens Max, Magical Snake Sword Max, Mother-Son Yin-Yang Sword Max...

In total, Li Zhiming had mastered 2,465 martial arts techniques, with 340 of them reaching an advanced level. His knowledge encompassed the entire Seven Mystic Gate, from the 36 absolute techniques of the Elder Hall to the various exotic martial arts practiced by the nine peaks.

Li Zhiming had transformed his fate, becoming a "Martial Arts Master" through his tireless efforts in the Medicine Valley over the past two years.
