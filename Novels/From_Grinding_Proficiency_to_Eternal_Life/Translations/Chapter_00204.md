# Chapter 204: The Murderer

"If the Master knew of your actions, he would not be angry but would greatly praise you. If we were to truly abandon these commoners, how would we differ from those six top sects?"

Fu Jin was about to speak when Xu Yunfan cut straight to the point. "I will go down the mountain first. The giant mechanical bird we rode here has been shaken apart; to return, we must walk for a while. Senior Brother, don't worry about me. I cultivate the Hundred Tempering Steel Body; I can move freely even within a battle formation."

Fu Jin's expression was complicated. The thousands of words in his heart eventually condensed into a single sentence.

"Junior Brother, be careful in all matters. If it is impossible to succeed, you must preserve your life and retreat. You are the Master's hope, the hope of the Forging Hall, and even... the best successor of the Divine Weapon Ridge!"

He naturally knew what Xu Yunfan intended to do.

Xu Yunfan had his own considerations. He did not care much for these commoners.

He merely wanted to test how powerful he had become. The battle with Tuoba Lie earlier, though intense, had far from reached his limit.

Moreover, the notifications of proficiency rising on his attribute panel made it difficult for him to move away. Only high-intensity combat against strong opponents would yield such effects.

Every point of proficiency gained on the attribute panel made the martial arts he cultivated more proficient.

Having held back for so long, Xu Yunfan naturally wanted to test his limits.

Currently, the experts of Great乾 in Yanbei Dao were mostly gathered in Yanbei City and were eyeing the surroundings of the Nine Shine Sect.

With his strength, which allowed him to crush Tuoba Lie—a warrior comparable to the Blood Transformation Realm—he only needed to carefully avoid experts of the Marrow Cleansing and Organ Refining Realms. Coupled with the endless vitality of the Pure Yang One Qi Art and the Qi replenishment from the Ginseng Child at his chest, he was confident he could sustain high-intensity battles for seven days without rest.

Xu Yunfan strode down the mountain and happened to see a squad of Great乾 soldiers resting at the foot.

He had no scruples whatsoever. With every step he took, a shallow pit was left in the ground.

When Xu Yunfan's ninth step landed on the exposed basalt, the rocks on the mountain path shattered like war drums beating. His tendons shook, and his heel dug three inches into the rock layer, scattering many pebbles.

The scouts watering their horses at the foot of the mountain looked up sharply. Seeing the seven-foot-long heavy hammer in the dust, their faces turned deathly pale.

"Enemy attack! Hexagram Formation! Raise shields!"

The commandant's shout trembled.

As soon as the twelve iron-clad shields formed a circle, Xu Yunfan's hammer head struck the copper rivets of the lead shield.

Slightly鼓起 (bulging) muscles, accompanied by the sound of wind and thunder, the hammer head trembled three times, its force layering upon itself. The fine steel shield face shattered directly into four pieces.

The soldier holding the shield didn't even grunt before being sent flying by an unimaginable force, his life or death unknown.

Xu Yunfan had deliberately held back.

The physical enhancement brought by the Muscle Refining Realm exceeded his imagination. Since breaking through yesterday, he could easily feel his strength still rising. If he used a bit more force, a single hammer blow would turn the man into a mist of blood.

As the second hammer swept horizontally, the trapezius muscle protruding from the back of Xu Yunfan's neck tightened like a bowstring.

The gravel whipped up by the hammer wind rattled against the iron armor. Six hooked spears thrust at him snapped instantly.

In the sparks generated by the iron soles of his boots rubbing against the blue stones, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in his hand churned up a murky white wave of air and crashed heavily into the formation.

Three breaths later, Xu Yunfan had slaughtered his way through the thirty-man squad. He shook his other hand, and the chain hammer retracted, turning back into the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. He grabbed the commandant by the throat.

Meeting the other's terrified gaze, Xu Yunfan asked, "Do you know who Tuoba Lie is?"

The commandant's Adam's apple rolled under Xu Yunfan's tiger-claw grip, the iron neck guard being crushed into five dents.

"Fourth Rank... Longxiang Four Towns...节度使 (Commissioner)," he coughed up blood foam. "He commanded... the Falcon Yang, Xuan Ge, Broken Formation, and Iron Forest camps... all elite central army troops... He carried... the Imperially bestowed hundred-jin Meteorite Iron Mountain-Swallowing Sword..."

Xu Yunfan understood. He casually tossed the commandant to the ground.

"Tell your superior, the one who killed Tuoba Lie is Su Zhenhe of the Xuanzhen Sect!"

Having said that, Xu Yunfan mounted the best scaled horse and galloped toward Qingzhou.

That night, Cuibo City, Cangzhou.

The copper clepsydra was nearing midnight when the candlelight in the main hall of the Cuibo City military office suddenly flickered several times.

Qi Wanshan's waist, adorned with a gilded Chi Tiger belt, struck the red sandalwood desk heavily, causing the twelve bronze tally tokens to clatter.

His eagle-like eyes swept over the blood-soaked commandant standing below, then fixed on the headless corpse on the carpet. The wolf-head design at the iron belt buckle clearly embedded with Tuoba clan's unique Uz steel pattern.

He flicked open the left arm guard of the corpse with his fingers; three snake-shaped bruises were writhing beneath the skin.

This was the abnormality of the meridians that only appeared three hours after the death of a Tuoba clan member when their true blood dissipated.

"Tuoba Lie is dead?!"

The tall, thin general widened his eyes, looking at the kneeling commandant and then at the headless corpse of Tuoba Lie, which was smashed beyond recognition.

If not for the aura of true blood emanating from the corpse, which he was extremely familiar with, he would have thought the commandant was there to play a joke.

Even so, his expression was one of disbelief. "With the martial arts experts in Qingzhou and Cangzhou having been purged recently, who could kill him?!"

"General Qi..."

The commandant, pale-faced, said, "That person claimed to be Su Zhenhe of the Xuanzhen Sect."

"Xuanzhen Sect... Su Zhenhe..."

Qi Wanshan's eyes flashed with thought. He immediately had someone bring a roster and flipped through it. "So it is the true disciple of Sect Master Guanshan Daoren of the Lingnan Dao Qingyue Xuanzhen Sect..."

He glanced at the mangled flesh of Tuoba Lie not far away and rubbed his aching temples.

With Tuoba Lie dead, the Tuoba clan naturally wouldn't accept it, especially his elder brother, Tuoba Li, who was currently encircling the Three States of the Nine Shine Sect. Upon hearing this news, Tuoba Li would certainly come for revenge.

"Tuoba Lie, oh Tuoba Lie. I placed you in the rear precisely to keep you out of trouble. How could you be killed so easily..."

Although Qi Wanshan felt helpless inside, a subtle expression flashed across his face as a thought occurred to him.

"Summon the参将 (Brigade General) of the Beacon Fire Camp."

As he turned, the hem of his robe extinguished two copper lamps. "Where is Tuoba Li's Xuan Ge Army?"

Before he finished speaking, three short and two long horn blasts suddenly came from outside the city.

When the personal guard burst through the carved door, he was holding a signal arrow carved with the Nine Shine Star Map. It was the communication arrow of Tuoba Li's vanguard camp surrounding the Nine Shine Sect.

Qi Wanshan raised his eyebrows, took the arrow, and his eyes flickered. If he could use this to advance a step further, it would be a good thing.

"Prepare an urgent report to send this news to the Tuoba clan. Additionally, I must have a letter from Tuoba Li of the Xuan Ge Army. I will write it myself!"

Early the next morning, after absorbing the overflowing Ginseng Qi from the Ginseng Child three times and completing his cultivation of the Pure Yang One Qi Art in a mountain forest, Xu Yunfan felt refreshed. He spurred his horse and headed toward Qingzhou.
