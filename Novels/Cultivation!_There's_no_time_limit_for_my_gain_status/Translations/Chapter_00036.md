# Chapter 36: A Monster's Emergence?

"May I ask, senior brother, how did you determine that person was a demon just now?"

At this moment, Yu Banxia and the others also arrived, standing beside Jiang Li with spiritual energy faintly gathering around them, ready to defend against any sudden attack.

"How did I determine? Isn't it obvious?"

The monk Zhengyuan looked somewhat puzzled now. His hearty smile gradually faded as he walked over to the youth he had struck down.

"This demon was covered in sinister energy and ferocious aura, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws to harm others. If that's not a demon, then what is it?"

*Cough! Cough! Cough!*

At that moment, the youth lying on the ground like a pile of mud suddenly coughed several times, his throat gurgling as if blocked by fluid. After spitting out a mouthful of bloody foam, his deeply sunken chest actually began to rise and fall again.

The youth was still alive.

"Hmm? Why has that sinister energy disappeared?"

The cultivator who claimed to be a disciple of the Cihang Temple scratched his head, still not understanding what had happened.

"Qianqian, go see if he can still be saved."

"Senior brother, the sinister energy just now was actually the effect of my spell. This youth is indeed not a demon."

"He, like the other children in the square, has been in a deep sleep and unable to wake up due to certain reasons..."

"Senior brother, please step back a little so our junior sister can see if she can treat his injuries."

Jiang Li briefly explained the general situation of the unconscious children in Yinnan Kingdom and raised his right hand, summoning a mass of Yin energy as proof of his words.

Seeing the Yin energy in Jiang Li's hand, Zhengyuan's eyes flashed with displeasure, but it quickly vanished.

"This... So that's how it is? There's actually such a strange illness?"

"Amitabha! It seems I mistakenly harmed an innocent person!"

"My fault, my fault!"

Zhengyuan appeared to be a reasonable person. Realizing the group was wary of him, he stepped back a considerable distance.

"Junior sister, please help treat the injured."

"This is the Jade Bone Regeneration Pill from our Cihang Temple, as a token of apology. I hope it can help this young man."

As he spoke, he took out a bottle of pills from his sleeve and offered it.

Jiang Li and the others stepped forward, separating him from the injured youth before allowing Lu Qianqian to begin her healing spell behind them.

Yu Banxia cautiously approached to take the pill bottle, sniffed it, and found nothing amiss, which eased his mind somewhat.

On one hand, their abilities were limited. On the other, they had no personal ties to the youth. They had no intention of standing up for him.

---

In truth, when Jiang Li released his Yin-attribute spiritual energy earlier, he had been prepared for the monk to attack in the name of vanquishing evil.

At the very least, judging by cultivation level, Zhengyuan, at the late Qi Refining stage, could easily take down their entire group of novices.

In such a situation, it was best to resolve matters peacefully.

"Senior Brother Zhengyuan is truly righteous. We will do our best to save the youth. To have the fortune of consuming such a spiritual pill in his lifetime is already a blessing for him."

Cultivators who compensate mortals after harming them are rare.

Moreover, the Jade Bone Regeneration Pill was a famous high-grade Yellow Tier pill, known for its effectiveness but low production.

Outer sect disciples like them could hardly find channels to purchase such pills, let alone spare one for a mortal.

In fact, the pill was likely more of a hush payment.

After all, feeding a mortal a high-grade Yellow Tier pill wasn't much different from killing them outright.

"One more thing."

"Judging by your attire, you must be disciples of the Hidden Scripture Valley, right?"

The major sects in the Great Heavy Mountain region generally maintained decent relations.

It was said that there were frequent exchanges between disciples, and historically, there had even been inter-sect marriages. Recognizing each other's disciple uniforms was normal.

Of course, the character "藏" (Hidden) embroidered on their left chests made it impossible to miss.

Similarly, the monk's attire was equally distinctive. If not for their inexperience as novices, they would have recognized him earlier.

"Indeed, we are disciples of the Hidden Scripture Valley. We came here to investigate the case of the unconscious children in Yinnan Kingdom."

Yu Banxia answered truthfully. It was unlikely the monk held any grudge against their sect—otherwise, that punch earlier would have landed on Jiang Li instead.

"Hmm. When you arrived, did you happen to see a graveyard or any place with particularly heavy Yin energy nearby?"

Zhengyuan asked solemnly, and the group understood.

He had initially appeared to ask the local officials for directions but had mistaken Jiang Li's controlled youth for a demon and attacked.

"Apologies, we haven't seen any graveyards. However, the king and officials of Yinnan Kingdom are over there. They might be able to help you."

"Senior Brother Zhengyuan, has something happened?"

The monk shook his head, either unwilling to elaborate or unaware himself.

"If you haven't seen one, then never mind. This area has been unsettled lately—it seems a monster has emerged."

---

"You'd best not leave the city while you're here. Once you resolve your business, don't linger. Return to your sect as soon as possible."

Jiang Li and the others exchanged uneasy glances. Could the children's condition be related to this monster? It seemed their mission had just gotten more complicated.

"Thank you for the warning, Senior Brother Zhengyuan. We'll be careful."

After expressing their gratitude, they introduced Zhengyuan to the king of Yinnan Kingdom, who was asked the same question.

However, the local officials and the king's answers were disappointing.

"Graveyard? What's that?"

"Oh, a place to bury the dead? Apologies, honored immortals and venerable master, but our kingdom has no graveyards."

"In Yinnan Kingdom, we have always practiced water burials. If a citizen cannot return to the embrace of Mother River after death, we consider it the greatest desecration."

The kingdom had no tradition of burial, making graveyards nonexistent.

The king and officials of Yinnan Kingdom had barely even heard the term "graveyard," indicating the custom had been in place for a long time.

Thinking back, during their carriage ride, they hadn't seen any burial mounds or tombstones. For a mortal kingdom with limited transportation, this was highly unusual—they couldn't have buried their dead too far away.

Even in modern times with cremation laws, cement graves were common in the mountains. Yet there were none here, confirming the truth of their words.

Failing to obtain the information he sought, Zhengyuan discreetly reminded them not to speak of the earlier incident before quickly departing.

But this was only the beginning.

News of the "monster's" emergence seemed to have spread far and wide. After Zhengyuan left, four or five more groups of cultivators arrived, asking the same questions.

Some were rogue cultivators, others were disciples from nearby sects.

Though their goal was the same, they clearly belonged to different factions.

After encountering two such groups, Jiang Li and the others unanimously agreed they shouldn't get further entangled in this matter.

A group of early and mid Qi Refining novices were far from qualified to meddle in affairs of this level.

They retreated to the palace of Yinnan Kingdom, avoiding further contact with outsiders and leaving the king and officials to handle the visitors.

Instead, they focused on studying the unconscious children, hoping to complete their mission and leave this troubled land as soon as possible.
