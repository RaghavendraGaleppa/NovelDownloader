# Chapter 149: The Observatory

The author: Black is Better than a Crow

"The Four Symbols Suppressing the Mountains requires a breathing rhythm matching 'Kan-Li Counter-Impulse.' You raised the frequency of the Earth Vein resonance by half a level, causing an overload naturally."

As he spoke, he tore the Thousand Mechanism Threads from his waist. The threads, like living things, burrowed into the gaps of the bearings. The Hundred Refinements Coiling Silk Strength vibrated along the threads, pulling down twelve misaligned gears and forcing them back into place to mesh.

Han Qiushan stood frozen on the spot.

This technique was clearly the "Mechanism Pull" secret transmission of the Mechanism Hall, yet Xu Yunfan's Coiling Silk Strength was three points purer than Mo Shisan's. As the chief disciple of the Mechanism Hall, Mo Shissan possessed natural talent and an intuitive sensitivity to minute details.

"The wind pressure in the Xun position is abnormal because the impeller has been pierced by seven air holes by the Earth Fire Stone," Xu Yunfan suddenly turned to another fault.

A black-gold wire lifted the red copper impeller from the furnace, and it flew into his palm with a sound. Under the effect of "Removing Impurities and Retaining the Essence," the charred holes were forcibly reshaped. He began to reshape the red copper in his hand, infused with Blood Qi, melting it like wax with terrifying strength.

He casually tossed the impeller back into the furnace, and the needle of the wind pressure gauge instantly returned to zero.

"This... this is the Heavenly Ministry's 'Flowing Fire Shaping'? But that is a secret technique only a Marrow-Washing Grandmaster can perform! How could..."

An elderly disciple with graying hair spoke with a trembling voice.

Everyone watched Xu Yunfan move between various fault points. The rhythm of his Thunderfire Hammer strikes subtly matched the Earth Vein's rhythm. Wherever he passed, the sound of gears meshing became as melodious as a set of bronze chimes.

When the final, canyon-like drive chain was welded shut by his Hundred Refinements Condensed Steel Technique, the trembling of the entire Heavenly Craft Fortress abruptly ceased.

Xu Yunfan wiped the iron dust from his forehead, but when he turned around, he saw the disciples of the Mechanism Hall take a synchronized step back, their eyes looking at him as if they were gazing upon the reincarnation of the First Grandmaster.

Mo Shisan, who had rushed over upon hearing the news, looked at Xu Yunfan with a complex mix of emotions. It was hard to imagine that just a few days ago, the man had been following him to practice the application of Hundred Refinements Coiling Silk Strength on various mechanical objects. Yet, the operation of sending a silk thread into a gap to correct a misaligned gear just now...

Mo Shisan could succeed five out of ten times doing it himself.

But none of those times looked as effortless and casual as Xu Yunfan's.

"Senior Brother Xu," Han Qiushan's Adam's apple bobbed, the wrench in his hand already twisted out of shape. "This technique of yours... is it truly from the Heavenly Craft Forging Art?"

Xu Yunfan smiled slightly. "It comes from your Mechanism Hall's Thousand Mechanisms Essential Manual."

As he spoke, he couldn't help but glance at a prompt rising in his vision indicating an increase in his Heavenly Craft Forging Art proficiency.

It was rare. Since he had first entered the realm of the Heavenly Craft Forging Art, only now had a proficiency point increase prompt appeared.

This made Xu Yunfan seriously consider maintaining this Heavenly Craft Fortress.

Mo Shisan let out a cold snort. "I can recite the Thousand Mechanisms Essential Manual backwards, but it doesn't cover the situation just now."

He was about to continue questioning when a earth-shattering explosion suddenly came from the engine cabin not far away.

Mo Shisan's face changed drastically.

"不好，压力舱爆了！" (Bad, the pressure chamber has exploded!)

At this moment, Xu Yunfan had already taken the lead and rushed off.

"..."

It wasn't until the early morning of the next day that the disciples of the Heavenly Craft Cave almost entirely entered the fray. Led by Mechanism Hall Master Mo Han, Mechanism Hall Chief Disciple Mo Shisan, and Casting Hall true disciple Xu Yunfan, they repaired all the various problems of the Heavenly Craft Fortress.

When dawn broke, Mo Han reluctantly let go of Xu Yunfan's arm under the fierce gaze of Zhan Yan. Under Mo Shisan's envious and sour gaze, Mo Han left, looking back three steps for every one he took.

Before leaving, he looked up and sighed, "生不逢时啊，当初要是我先遇上他就好了。" (I was born at the wrong time; if only I had met him first back then.)

Xu Yunfan could only maintain a polite smile.

Thirty miles outside the Jade Capital, on the official road, twelve sweat-blooded dragon horses were pulling a bronze blood cauldron at full speed.

These three-zhang-tall giant cauldrons were covered in dark red rust, and the玄铁 (titanium-steel) chains at the mouths of the cauldrons clanged with the jolting.

The bottom of each blood cauldron was engraved with the patterns of the "Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions," currently leaking thick blood plasma, dragging serpentine blood trails along the bluestone road, moving according to a certain trajectory.

Inside the Jade Capital, atop the five hundred and thirty-three-zhang Observatory, Guo Lang's Taoist robe fluttered in the fierce wind.

He looked down at the surging sea of blood clouds below, his heart filled with extreme complexity.

By yesterday, the Incense Sect had completed the blood sacrifice of over thirty-six million people. Next, it was his turn to act.

Regardless of success or failure today, he would be nailed to the pillar of shame, bearing the infamy of the ages.

Not far away, beneath the Nine Dragons Canopy, the Empress sat in the center, her deep eyes carrying an indescribable look of anticipation.

But things had come to this, and there was no turning back for him. Guo Lang looked up at the full moon hanging in the sky, took a light breath, and a wisp of True Qi suddenly surged from his fingertips. The divine weapon in his hand, the Taiyi Light-Splitting Sword, lit up its edge, reflecting the positions of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions.

"Heaven sends out killing intent, shifting stars and changing mansions."

Guo Lang's sword pointed at the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, and the Big Dipper suddenly lit up as bright as day.

Behind him, three hundred and sixty Incense Sect priests began to chant the "Blood River Crossing World Sutra," the sound waves shaking the titanium-steel chains at the base of the Observatory.

Thirty-six hundred bronze blood cauldrons were arranged along the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansion star formation, the blood plasma inside emitting a strange golden-green color.

The bronze sundial on the top level of the Observatory suddenly turned to the Hai position. Guo Lang's left hand pressed down on the center of the dial, the Taiji Fish, while his right hand's Taiyi Light-Splitting Sword lifted seven bronze lamps.

The back of the Supervisor of the Imperial Observatory's hand was bulging with blue veins, the tendons twisting and knotting under the skin into the shape of a dragon—a sign of the Jade Vein achieved upon the completion of tendon training.

"Activate the formation!"

Atop the observatory, three hundred and sixty Incense Sect priests simultaneously slit their wrists. Blood followed the grooves of the formation patterns, converging into the central blood pool.

Guo Lang's sword tip划出 (drew) the trajectory of the Big Dipper across the surface of the blood pool, and the plasma suddenly boiled like hot oil.

From below came the wailing of the citizens within the seventy-two wards of the Jade Capital, the sound waves making the titanium-steel chains clang.

The Taotie patterns on the surface of the blood cauldrons gradually glowed red, and the star chart's rotation was reflected in Guo Lang's pupils.

He suddenly recalled the days cultivating in the Ghost Valley thirty years ago. At that time, his master, observing the stars at night, deduced the "Taiyi Salvation Sutra," originally created to resolve calamities.

The scripture was still here, but the person who should have been the savior of the calamity had become the evil star of destruction.

In an instant, beneath the nine-layered observatory, the Imperial Court belonging to the central axis of the Great Zhou suddenly shook.

"The Earth Vein is beginning to flip!" the Empress couldn't help but stand up, staring fixedly at the churning sea of clouds below that was gradually turning blood-red and showing strange ripples.

The eight hundred cultivators of the previous dynasty locked the Primordial Spirit with the Earth Vein. Today, the prosperity of old would finally be restored.

"The Earth sends out killing intent, dragons and snakes rise from the land!"

The sword edge turned toward the Dihu position, and a dull rumble came from the bottom of the Observatory.

Seventy-two ancient wells in the Jade Capital simultaneously spewed blood columns. The water-suppressing beasts carved on the well edges actually opened their stone eyes in the blood rain.

The tiger's mouth of Guo Lang's hand was cracked, blood seeping into the star chart along the Kui dragon patterns on the sword handle.

At the same time, across the entire Great Zhou, washed in blood by the Incense Sect, a ghostly wind rose out of thin air, accompanied by the wails and angry roars of ghosts.

Nine Liangs Sect in the Northern Dao of Yanbei, tens of thousands of miles away, Beichenzi was staring at the sect's treasure, the "Seismograph."

The jade ball in the copper dragon's mouth suddenly fell into the copper toad plate. His callous-covered fingers traced the scratches on the instrument's body.

"The Earth Vein disturbance in the Jade Capital has exceeded the Great Earthquake of the Tianqi Three Years by more than tenfold."
