**Chapter 12: Peach Blossom Forest**

"This place is truly hard to find!" At this moment, Zhao Di was walking through a valley in the southern part of the Flowing Cloud Mountain Range. Green hills and lush trees surrounded him, and occasionally, faint wafts of floral fragrance drifted by. Contradictory to the scenery was the sound of rushing water pouring into a pool, masking the chirping of insects and birds. Yet, all around him were green hills and lush trees; there was no visible water flow.

After several days of traversing mountains, Zhao Di finally arrived at the mysterious waterfall mentioned by the old farmer.

Zhao Di released his spiritual sense, spreading his awareness to the surroundings, and indeed, he detected something unusual. He immediately infused spiritual energy into his eyes, intending to use Spirit Sight to see clearly.

"Indeed, it's an illusion! But thankfully, it seems to be the simplest kind," Zhao Di thought with a hint of relief. This illusion was clearly designed for mortals; any cultivator skilled in Spirit Sight could meticulously observe and discover its flaws.

The flaw lay in a large tree, about three feet thick, not far from Zhao Di's right hand. This tree subtly emitted faint spiritual light fluctuations. Furthermore, upon closer inspection, while its leaves appeared to sway gently in the wind, their amplitude and frequency were exactly identical each time, completely unrelated to the wind direction or strength.

Zhao Di cast a Vajra Shield upon himself, instantly enveloping his entire body in a faint golden light. Within the golden light, Zhao Di walked straight towards the large tree, showing no signs of stopping even as he reached it.

The instant Zhao Di's Vajra Shield touched the tree, the tree suddenly shimmered with spiritual light a few times, then vanished. After Zhao Di passed through, it reappeared as a dense, green-leafed tree.

Zhao Di, protected by the golden light, easily passed through the "large tree," and the scenery before his eyes abruptly transformed.

Ahead, there were no longer any green hills or trees; it was clearly a forest of pink peach blossoms. A little further away, a beautiful, cloud-piercing peak rose majestically, and a silver-chain-like waterfall flowed from its mountainside. The rushing sound of water originated from this very spot.

Zhao Di slowly walked through the relatively sparse peach blossom forest, heading towards the waterfall. It was early summer, and most of the hundred flowers in the lowlands had already withered, but the temperature in the mountains was slightly lower, and the peach blossoms were in full bloom. Smelling the intoxicating floral fragrance, Zhao Di couldn't help but softly recite: "In the human world, April's beauty fades away; mountain temple peach blossoms begin to bloom!" He thought it was a pity there were only mountains and peach blossoms here, but no temple, otherwise it would have been perfectly fitting.

However, as he passed through the peach blossom forest, he witnessed an even more fitting scene.

In the emerald pool, several tens of zhang in circumference, beneath the waterfall, a black-haired, graceful maiden was playing in the water, completely naked.

At this point, still two to three hundred zhang away from the maiden, Zhao Di immediately stopped. He noticed a spiritual light flickering around her body, indicating she was also a cultivator. This was the first cultivator Zhao Di had encountered since leaving the Jian family. He hadn't expected her to be a stunning female cultivator, nor that he would meet her in such a "peach blossoms in full bloom, romantic spring light" situation.

The maiden evidently hadn't noticed Zhao Di immediately. With his mind racing, Zhao Di simply slipped back into the peach blossom forest unnoticed.

The maiden, who was enjoying her bath in the pool, suddenly heard a male voice from the nearby peach blossom forest: "In the mortal world, April's beauty fades away; immortal mountain peach blossoms begin to bloom."

"Who's there? Don't come closer!" The maiden, startled, quickly submerged her entire body in the emerald pool, leaving only her head exposed, and vigilantly stared towards the peach forest.

A slender man in luxurious secular attire emerged from the peach forest. Upon seeing the scene, he immediately turned his back to the maiden and said loudly, "Immortaless, please don't be offended. I am heading to the Flowing Cloud Market and stumbled upon this place unintentionally. I ask for your understanding."

The maiden saw that he indeed had spiritual light flickering around him, but judging by the strength of the fluctuations, his cultivation seemed to be nothing special. Coupled with his voice, which suggested he was just a callow youth, she felt greatly relieved. She called out to the youth, "Don't come any closer; return to the peach blossom forest for now."

Seeing the youth obediently and prudently retreat into the peach blossom forest and disappear from sight, the maiden quickly dried herself and dressed. Once her emotions had calmed, she called out towards the peach forest again, "Fellow Daoist, you may come out now."

Hearing this, Zhao Di slowly emerged from the peach forest and stopped about ten zhang in front of the maiden. Previously, due to the distance and his hasty glimpse, he hadn't clearly seen her appearance. Now he realized she was a beautiful woman with arched eyebrows, phoenix eyes, a high nose, small mouth, and fair, tender skin. She seemed a year or two older than him. At the same time, Zhao Di also noticed that her cultivation was slightly higher than his, probably around the fifth level of Qi Condensation.

Zhao Di cupped his hands in a respectful gesture and said, "I unintentionally disturbed Immortaless's leisure, and I ask for your forgiveness. I wish to inquire about the entrance to the Flowing Cloud Market. Would Immortaless be able to offer some guidance?"

"The Flowing Cloud Market you speak of is indeed not far from here. The entrance is on the mountainside of a cliff sixty li to the southwest, and it's quite easy to find. Specifically, it's..." The maiden maintained a cold, distant expression, though her cheeks were slightly flushed as she pondered if the other party hadn't seen anything. Her tone, however, was flat and devoid of any irritation.

Seeing the maiden had answered his question, Zhao Di didn't dare to linger. After a few words of thanks, he headed southwest.

After running and walking for two to three hours, Zhao Di found the place the maiden had described. Before him was an almost vertical mountain cliff, shrouded in dense mist from about a hundred zhang above its base, making it impossible to see how high the entire cliff extended.

It seemed the entrance was within this thick mist, but it was so high above the ground; how was one to ascend?

The cliff face was entirely smooth rock, offering no handholds for climbing.

Only Foundation Establishment cultivators who had mastered the "Levitation Art," or those possessing a flying magical artifact, could directly fly into the mist.

Yet, the Flowing Cloud Market was clearly a trading place primarily for low- and mid-level Qi Condensation cultivators, and any flying magical artifact was quite expensive, making it impossible for every cultivator visiting the market to possess one.

Zhao Di used his Spirit Sight to its fullest extent. Other than discerning faint spiritual light flickering within the mist, he found nothing else. This cliff was clearly real, not an illusion like the large tree he had encountered earlier.

Zhao Di circled the area a few times. With no other options, he had no choice but to retrace his steps to find that "Immortaless" again and ask for clarification, assuming she was still there.

Fearing the female cultivator might leave, Zhao Di quickened his pace.

He had only walked back for less than two hours when suddenly, sounds of a man and woman shouting came from ahead. A woman and a man burst out of the nearby forest, one after the other, separated by only a few tens of zhang. Their distance was rapidly closing, and the former was on the verge of being caught by the latter at any moment.

Zhao Di was startled. His first reaction was to turn and leave, but the two were incredibly fast. Before he could turn and run a few steps, they spotted him.

"Fellow Daoist, wait! Fellow Daoist, help! Ah, you're the Fellow Daoist I saw this morning!" The running woman, seeing someone ahead, immediately clung to him as a lifeline, shouting for help. She then recognized Zhao Di's attire.

Hearing that it was indeed the "Immortaless'" voice behind him, Zhao Di paused, then slowly turned and stopped.

In any case, with his speed, he wouldn't get far before being caught anyway, and he would still be implicated. He might as well act a bit more gallantly.

Zhao Di, of course, knew there must be danger; otherwise, why would this maiden, whose cultivation was a level higher than his, be shouting for help? With a flash of golden light, he cast the defensive spell "Vajra Shield" upon himself.

The maiden now bore no resemblance to her cold demeanor from their first meeting earlier that morning. Her cheeks were flushed, and she was dripping with sweat, which only added to her allure. She gratefully nodded at Zhao Di, then stood side-by-side with him, several zhang apart.

At this moment, the man who had been relentlessly pursuing her also caught up, stopping quietly seven or eight zhang in front of the two.

He was a refined-looking young man, even somewhat handsome, save for a slightly lecherous mustache. He was now watching the two with a smiling gaze.

After clearly discerning the spiritual energy fluctuations emanating from the newcomer, Zhao Di secretly groaned in his heart.

This young man actually had an eighth-level Qi Condensation cultivation, significantly higher than both Zhao Di and the female cultivator.

"What seems to be the misunderstanding between you two? I'm just passing by. We are all cultivators, so it's best to prioritize harmony!" Zhao Di uttered these utterly useless pleasantries while his mind raced, devising a strategy. Simultaneously, he quietly hid his Immortal-Slaying Flying Dagger and a dozen talismans in his sleeve.
