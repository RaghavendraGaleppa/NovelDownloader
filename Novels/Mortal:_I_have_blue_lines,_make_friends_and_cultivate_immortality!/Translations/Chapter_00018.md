# Chapter 18: Talisman Master Identity Exposed! The Crowd is Stunned!

"Hmm?" Li Huayuan glanced at Nangong Wan who had stopped him, as well as Chen Qiaoqian and Dong Xuan'er who now stood before Lin Yun.

Nangong Wan was understandable—she was from the Masked Moon Sect. 

But you two are from Yellow Maple Valley! We're on the same side! That arrogant brat is the outsider!

Meanwhile, Han Li behind Lin Yun was looking at him with a strange expression, then at the Masked Moon Sect elder.

"Didn't Brother Lin say it's best not to even meet her eyes directly?"

"Why does it seem like they're quite familiar now?!"

"And where did this pink-robed female cultivator come from suddenly?"

"Brother Lin, just how many things are you hiding from me?"

"Damn it!"

"I'm so jealous!"

Han Li's gaze carried a trace of resentment. He felt emotionally deceived by Lin Yun—he seemed to be just another fish in Lin Yun's pond.

Chen Qiaoqian glared at Dong Xuan'er beside her, her delicate brows furrowed in displeasure. "Who are you?! Why are you standing up for Brother Lin too?"

"Hmph—" Seeing Chen Qiaoqian's angry expression, Dong Xuan'er raised her chin smugly. "None of your business!"

"I fell for Brother Lin at first sight, so I'm helping him. Got a problem with that?"

After speaking, Dong Xuan'er turned to Lin Yun with a pitiful look. "Brother Lin, look at her—she doesn't even know you but is standing up for you. She must have ulterior motives."

"Not like me—I only know how to care for you."

"You—" Chen Qiaoqian was nearly driven mad by Dong Xuan'er's act. "You just met Brother Lin today!"

"I've known him for years!"

"And who are you anyway? Can you even help him?"

"I'm from the Chen Family!"

Chen Qiaoqian shot Dong Xuan'er a threatening glare, her intent clear.

"Hmph—as if I'm scared!" Dong Xuan'er placed her hands on her hips fearlessly. "You're from the Chen Family? Well, I'm from the Dong Family!"

"My master is the number one Golden Core cultivator in Yellow Maple Valley—Grandmaster Hongfu!"

"You stay away from Brother Lin, or I'll have my master wipe out your Chen Family!"

"You—" Clearly no match for Dong Xuan'er's sharp tongue, Chen Qiaoqian was left fuming, her chest heaving with rage. She truly wanted to stab the other girl with her Darkwater Sword, but Dong Xuan'er's background was indeed more formidable.

Her Chen Family's Golden Core ancestor was only at the early stage, while Dong Xuan'er's master, Grandmaster Hongfu, was already at the late Golden Core stage, preparing to break through to Nascent Soul—there was simply no comparison.

---

"Seriously? These two beauties are fighting over a Five Spiritual Roots Qi Condensation rogue cultivator?!" The onlookers felt a pang of envy, their hearts burning with jealousy toward Lin Yun.

They wished they could replace him right then and there.

"Why not me?!"

"Fair maiden! Look at me! I may not be as dashing as Lin Yun, but my spiritual roots are better than his!"

Watching Dong Xuan'er and Chen Qiaoqian argue gave Li Huayuan a headache.

Why were these two fighting over a rogue cultivator?

Chen Qiaoqian was one thing—the Chen Family ancestor had some ties with him, but it wasn't like the ancestor would fight him over Li Mufeng. Impossible!

But Dong Xuan'er was another matter. Before coming, Senior Sister Hongfu had given him clear instructions.

What truly baffled Li Huayuan was Nangong Wan. Who was she? Why was she standing up for this rogue cultivator too? Were they close?

Meanwhile, the Golden Core cultivators from the other five sects on the viewing platform were deep in thought.

The Masked Moon Sect wouldn't act without reason—there must be something more to this.

"Fellow Daoist from the Masked Moon Sect, what is the meaning of this?" Li Huayuan asked.

"Fellow Daoist Li, this humble one merely wishes to ask him a few questions first. Afterward, you may decide his fate. Would that be acceptable?" Nangong Wan negotiated.

Li Huayuan nodded, though he wondered why the Masked Moon Sect's Golden Core cultivator would help Lin Yun.

"Your name is Lin Yun, correct?" A voice as clear and melodious as a nightingale's song reached Lin Yun's ears.

Lin Yun nodded.

"I have a question for you. Answer truthfully—you understand your situation. If your answer satisfies me, I can protect you."

"Did you draw those talismans yourself?"

Hearing Nangong Wan's question, Lin Yun nodded again.

Nangong Wan glanced at the Golden Core cultivators from the other sects. Some had already caught on, their gazes filled with greed. She knew she wasn't the only one who had noticed.

In that case, they had to lay everything out openly.

With a wave of her hand, Nangong Wan sent a white jade brush, a stack of talisman paper, and cinnabar floating before Lin Yun.

"Here are one hundred sheets of talisman paper. If you can successfully draw two high-grade primary talismans, I will believe you and protect you, allowing you to join the Masked Moon Sect!"

---

Nangong Wan herself was a mid-grade talisman master, so she naturally carried talisman-making materials.

The crowd instantly understood—no wonder the Masked Moon Sect's Golden Core ancestor had intervened. Lin Yun was a talisman master!

This also explained why Lin Yun possessed so many talismans.

However, many began to worry for Lin Yun.

"Isn't the Masked Moon Sect's Golden Core ancestor bullying him?"

"One hundred sheets for two high-grade primary talismans? That's a two percent success rate!"

Talisman masters among rogue cultivators were already rare, let alone those capable of high-grade primary talismans. Lin Yun was only at the eleventh level of Qi Condensation. A one percent success rate would already mark him as a prodigy, much less two!

Li Huayuan's eyes widened in realization. "No wonder this kid dared to act so arrogantly!"

"To be a talisman master at the Qi Condensation stage!"

The other Golden Core ancestors also focused intently on Lin Yun.

Meanwhile, Han Li beside Lin Yun was still stunned.

"A talisman master?"

"Brother Lin?!"

"But I've never seen Brother Lin draw talismans before! Didn't he say it was extremely difficult?"

Lin Yun picked up the jade brush, admiring its smooth texture and faint fragrance. "A fine brush!"

Then he smiled. "One hundred sheets are too many. For mere high-grade primary talismans, ten will suffice!"

With his max-level talisman mastery, Lin Yun could easily succeed with just two sheets. But to avoid causing too much of a stir, he decided to tone it down.

"Ten sheets?!"

Dong Xuan'er and Chen Qiaoqian exchanged shocked glances.

"Brother Lin!" Chen Qiaoqian's eyes held concern—she had never seen Lin Yun draw talismans before.

Dong Xuan'er was purely astonished. If Lin Yun could achieve two successes in ten attempts, he wouldn't just be a genius—he'd be a monster!

Talisman crafting was notoriously difficult. Even her master, Hongfu, couldn't craft mid-grade talismans and had given up. If Lin Yun already had such a terrifying success rate, he was destined to become at least a mid-grade talisman master, possibly even a high-grade one!

High-grade talisman masters were exceedingly rare.

"Ten sheets? Isn't Lin Yun being too arrogant?" Zhou Qingning frowned. "Even the best talisman master in our Masked Moon Sect wouldn't dare claim a twenty percent success rate, let alone a Qi Condensation cultivator!"

"Tsk—Lin Yun's arrogance knows no bounds!" A rogue cultivator scoffed. "I, Lu Wei, have never seen a talisman master with such a high success rate!"

"If he really pulls this off..."

"I'll eat my own magical instrument right here!"

"Ten sheets?" Nangong Wan frowned. As a mid-grade talisman master, she knew the difficulties firsthand. "This guy's confidence is outrageous. When I was at Qi Condensation, even one success in fifty attempts was considered lucky."

"Isn't he afraid of embarrassing himself?" The Golden Core cultivators exchanged glances.

"Ha ha ha—" Facing the crowd's skepticism, Lin Yun laughed. "Without skill, it's arrogance. With skill, it's confidence!"

"And I happen to have the skill to back it up!"

With swift, flowing strokes, Lin Yun began.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, he successfully crafted two high-grade primary Thousand Blades Talismans by the eighth sheet!

The entire arena was stunned.

After so many shocks today, Han Li was completely dumbfounded.

"Brother Lin, didn't you say talisman crafting was extremely difficult?"

"Didn't you tell me rogue cultivators rarely become talisman masters, that only major families and sects have them?"

"Is this how you define 'rare'?!"

"Tsk—"

"Holy—"

"And it's the hardest metal-element spell talisman! Lin Yun is defying the heavens!"

"If he continues growing like this, he'll undoubtedly become a mid-grade talisman master!"
