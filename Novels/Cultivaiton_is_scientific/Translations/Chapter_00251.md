# Chapter 251: Transaction  

What surprised Master Luo even more was her observation of Li Shiming's Stellar Sea of Formations, which had reached a level close to that of a Formation Master.  

Li Shiming was just one step away from becoming a Formation Master. All he needed was a moment of enlightenment—perhaps tomorrow, perhaps several years later.  

But regardless of how long it took for that enlightenment to come, Li Shiming's ascension to Formation Master was already inevitable.  

"Shi Lan, you've broken through?" Master Luo, while scrutinizing Li Shiming and Yin Shilan, suddenly noticed Yin Shilan's breakthrough.  

Additionally, Li Shiming's strength left Master Luo astonished. Her perception told her that Li Shiming had reached the same mid-stage Foundation Building realm as Yin Shilan.  

"Master, I just broke through after drinking the spirit tea Shiming brought!" Yin Shilan replied with a blissful smile.  

Master Luo glanced at the jade cup nearby and exchanged a look with the Golden Core cultivator beside her. Both were surprised by Li Shiming's generosity.  

Even for a high-ranking elder like Master Luo, third-grade spirit tea was a rare commodity, distributed only once every five years in quantities of a dozen leaves or so. Such tea was typically reserved for the closest of friends.  

However, considering Li Shiming's status within the Shushan Sect, it was possible he had access to such precious resources, usually reserved for Golden Core cultivators.  

Master Luo rarely regretted anything, especially after becoming a Golden Core cultivator. But today, she felt a pang of regret. Had she taken Li Shiming as her disciple back then, the benefits to her and the sect would have been immense.  

"Disciple Li Shiming pays his respects to Master Luo!" Li Shiming bowed deeply in a gesture of respect.  

Whether it was because she was Yin Shilan's master or because she had once granted him the status of an outer disciple of the Thousand Illusions Sect, she deserved his reverence.  

Though he hadn't used that status, it had been his safety net, giving him the confidence to travel thousands of miles to the Northern Shu Continent.  

"Li Shiming, I misjudged you. Had I known, I would have kept you by my side," Master Luo admitted without hiding her emotions, shaking her head with a sigh. She then introduced the Golden Core cultivator beside her, "This is Elder Niu, and this is his disciple, Xiao Ke."  

Master Luo clearly knew what had transpired, but she didn't use her connection with Li Shiming to plead for Xiao Ke. She merely made the introductions.  

Li Shiming's favor was now too valuable to waste on such trivial matters.  

"Greetings, Elder Niu!" Li Shiming bowed respectfully.  

"Fellow Daoist Li, I'm here to ask a favor on behalf of my disciple. Xiao Ke acted improperly and deserved his punishment, but I hope you can show mercy and dispel the sword intent within him," Elder Niu said, returning the greeting as an equal rather than accepting Li Shiming's deference.  

When Xiao Ke had been brought back by Elder Zheng, Elder Niu had been furious upon seeing the state of his disciple's spiritual lake.  

But after hearing the details of the incident outside the mountain gate from Elder Zheng, Elder Niu had nearly struck Xiao Ke dead on the spot.  

While others were trying every means to befriend Li Shiming, Xiao Ke had gone out of his way to offend him.  

Still, Xiao Ke was his disciple, and Elder Niu had to resolve the sword intent within him.  

After careful examination, however, Elder Niu hesitated to act. The slightest mistake could lead to the collapse of Xiao Ke's spiritual lake, ending his cultivation path entirely.  

Thus, Elder Niu sought out Master Luo to arrange this meeting.  

"Elder Niu, dispelling the sword intent is simple. But I ask that you ensure Xiao Ke refrains from harassing Yin Shilan in the future," Li Shiming said. He had no intention of making an enemy; he merely wanted to teach Xiao Ke a lesson.  

With Elder Niu personally intervening and Master Luo present, refusal was not an option.  

Though Master Luo knew of the incident outside the mountain gate, she hadn't been aware of the cause. Hearing Li Shiming's words, she fixed a stern gaze on Xiao Ke.  

She regretted her involvement even more. Had she known Xiao Ke had been harassing Yin Shilan, she wouldn't have lifted a finger to help him.  

As a female cultivator herself, she understood the troubles women often faced in the sect. She had thought her protection would shield her disciples from such issues.  

"Fellow Daoist Li, rest assured. Upon our return, I will confine Xiao Ke to a year of seclusion. If he dares disturb Yin Shilan again, I will personally deal with this disgraceful disciple!" Elder Niu said, his face burning with shame under Master Luo's gaze. He glared at Xiao Ke with undisguised fury.  

Xiao Ke shrank back, unable to use his spiritual lake but still feeling the piercing stares of his master and Master Luo.  

Li Shiming smiled and swept his divine sense over Xiao Ke, withdrawing the sword intent he had left behind.  

Master Luo and Elder Niu were both inwardly amazed. No wonder Li Shiming had achieved such success in alchemy—he had already mastered divine sense at the mid-stage Foundation Building realm.  

Master Luo even considered having Li Shiming retake the spiritual root test. Could the Heavenly Sea Sect's assessment have been wrong? How could a genius like Li Shiming, excelling in cultivation speed, formations, and alchemy, only possess a triple spiritual root?  

"I'm here!" Liang Yexuan's voice rang out as she flew toward the mountaintop pavilion, having bypassed the formation.  

When she saw Master Luo and Elder Niu in the pavilion, she stuck out her tongue and quickly bowed.  

"Still as reckless as ever, Yexuan. What's the rush?" Master Luo said with mild affection.  

Even Elder Niu smiled warmly, showing no displeasure at her lack of decorum. Liang Yexuan was different from other elite disciples—she had grown up in the sect under the protection of her father, Elder Liang. Many Golden Core elders doted on her as if she were their own.  

"Nothing, really!" Liang Yexuan hastily stowed the jade box she had been holding into her storage bracelet and shook her head.  

She was no fool. There was no way she would mention the "Beauty Preservation Pill" in front of Master Luo.  

Her transaction with Li Shiming wasn't complete yet. If Master Luo learned of it, she could easily outbid Liang Yexuan with her wealth—acquiring a full set of third-grade Five Elements formation materials would be trivial for her.  

Liang Yexuan had gone to great lengths, even resorting to begging and pleading, to secure two third-grade materials from her father. She couldn't let someone else swoop in now.  

Master Luo chuckled at Liang Yexuan's evasiveness but didn't press further. It was just a harmless secret between youngsters.  

"Li Shiming, Shi Lan, I won't intrude on your reunion any longer," Master Luo said with a smile.  

"Fellow Daoist Li, I'll take Xiao Ke back now. I'll make amends another time," Elder Niu added, taking his leave.  

The two Golden Core cultivators departed with Xiao Ke, leaving Li Shiming to bow in farewell.  

"I almost gave it away in front of Master Luo!" Liang Yexuan patted her chest in relief.  

"You got the third-grade formation materials so quickly?" Yin Shilan asked curiously.  

"I cried my eyes out in front of my father, and he finally gave in!" Liang Yexuan boasted proudly.  

She handed the jade box to Li Shiming, her eyes gleaming with anticipation.  

Li Shiming didn't hesitate. He opened the box and inspected the wood and water attribute third-grade formation materials.  

Both were high-quality and met his requirements.  

Of course, the Thousand Illusions Sect was a major sect, and its high-ranking elders had access to resources beyond ordinary cultivators' wildest dreams.  

A weight lifted from Li Shiming's heart. With all five third-grade Five Elements formation materials secured and his cultivation at late-stage Foundation Building, he was now fully prepared for his Golden Core breakthrough—pending only the refinement of the necessary pills.  

After that, it would all come down to luck.  

Li Shiming took out a jade vial and placed it on the stone table.  

Liang Yexuan snatched it up immediately, carefully opening it to examine its contents.  

Recalling the sect's records on the Beauty Preservation Pill, she verified its authenticity.  

A look of ecstasy spread across her face. No third-grade materials could compare to this pill—it would preserve her youthful beauty forever.  

Any female cultivator would go mad for it. Two third-grade materials in exchange for this treasure? She felt she had gotten the better end of the deal, almost as if Li Shiming had given her preferential treatment because of Yin Shilan.  

"Deal done!" Liang Yexuan declared, immediately swallowing the pill.  

Keeping such a treasure was risky—any influential female cultivator who saw it might snatch it away. Better to consume it immediately.  

Her skin began to visibly transform, becoming smoother and more radiant, her pores nearly invisible.  

She could feel the changes and touched her face in awe, her mouth hanging open in an unladylike manner—though she had never been one for decorum.  

"Shi Lan, look at my skin!" she exclaimed, tugging at Yin Shilan to share her joy.  

"Liang Yexuan, it's getting late. Shouldn't you be heading back?" Li Shiming interjected, unmoved by her excitement.  

He had come all this way to spend time with Yin Shilan, only to be interrupted repeatedly.  

"Fine, I'll go find my sisters!" Liang Yexuan said, leaping into the air with the same haste with which she had arrived.  

Li Shiming wanted to remind her not to spread word of the Beauty Preservation Pill, but she was already gone in a flash.  

"Lan'er, I can't stay long. I need to leave now, or there will be trouble," Li Shiming said, knowing that news of the pill would spread quickly.  

"Shiming, we'll have many more chances to meet. I'll wait for you," Yin Shilan replied softly, though parting so soon pained her.  

Moved, Li Shiming gently embraced her.  

"Once we reach Golden Core, we'll become cultivation partners and never part," he vowed firmly.  

"Yes," Yin Shilan whispered, feeling like the happiest woman in the world.  

The Thousand Illusions Sect had many female cultivators, owing to its cultivation techniques, several of which were better suited to women.  

True to Li Shiming's fears, Liang Yexuan wasted no time boasting to her friends. Soon, news of the Beauty Preservation Pill spread like wildfire among the sect's female cultivators.  

Not long after returning to her cave abode, Master Luo received numerous inquiries from female sect members—including several Golden Core elders—all asking about Li Shiming and requesting introductions.  

Puzzled by the sudden interest, she inquired further and learned from a close friend about Liang Yexuan obtaining a Beauty Preservation Pill from Li Shiming.  

Master Luo froze. She recalled Liang Yexuan's nervous demeanor earlier—she must have been in the middle of that very transaction.  

For the third time that day, regret washed over her.  

Had she pressed Liang Yexuan just a little, the girl would have spilled the secret.  

Master Luo touched her face. A single Beauty Preservation Pill could restore her youthful radiance. She was a woman too, and even with her cultivation techniques, nothing compared to the pill's effects.  

She had no intention of facilitating introductions for the others. In a flash, she flew toward Yin Shilan's mountain.  

Recalling Yin Shilan's earlier transformation, she now realized it must have been due to the pill.  

One for Yin Shilan, one for Liang Yexuan. If Li Shiming had two, and likely took one himself, he must have more.  

As a high-level alchemist, there was a good chance he had refined them himself.  

Given his skills, he would have produced a full batch—meaning at least seven more pills remained.  

With that thought, Master Luo sped up. The two peaks were close, and she arrived in moments.  

But when she entered the formation, only Yin Shilan remained. Li Shiming was gone.  

She sighed inwardly—she was too late.  

Across the sect, many cultivators were now searching for Li Shiming, while others sought out Yin Shilan.  

For a long time to come, Yin Shilan wouldn't know peace.  

But that, perhaps, was a happy problem to have.
