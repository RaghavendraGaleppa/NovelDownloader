# Chapter 15: Techniques Perfected, Slaying

Yang Ji had fresh water and dried food, so he was in no hurry to leave. He was determined to wear down this Overlord Crab.

He had discovered that continuous combat rapidly increased the proficiency of his techniques, several times faster than practicing alone. It was rare to encounter such a well-matched opponent, so he naturally wouldn't let go of such a good opportunity.

Just like this...

[Flowing Water Sword Art (Initial Mastery): 1/100]
[Light Body Art (Initial Mastery): 1/100]

Yang Ji's flying sword traced arcs, resembling flowing water, yet also like the gentle turns of Tai Chi. Sword by sword, he completely deflected the immense force from the Overlord Crab's spear-like legs, often rendering its powerful, heavy blows useless. Having comprehended "feather swaying with the wind," his movements were nimble, pausing and moving, rising and falling erratically. His movement technique had greatly improved, allowing him to respond to the Overlord Crab's attacks with much more ease.

The Overlord Crab, however, grew increasingly frustrated with each exchange, feeling that the human in front of it was becoming more and more elusive. Despite using all its tricks, it couldn't harm him. Yang Ji also sensed its thoughts and would occasionally pretend to be hit, instantly re-energizing the crab and making it excited. Such battles occurred punctually every night.

Time flew by. Another ten days passed. Yang Ji had now been on Desolate Isle for fifteen days.

The continuous high-intensity combat led to further breakthroughs in his Flowing Water Sword Art and Light Body Art.

[You continuously use the Flowing Water Sword Art. Within the Softness of the Sword, you comprehended the Hardness of the Sword; water can pierce stone, and sword qi is sharp and piercing. Your Flowing Water Sword Art has broken through, reaching Major Mastery.]
[You continuously use the Light Body Art. Within "feather swaying with the wind," you comprehended "riding the wind," significantly increasing your speed. Your Light Body Art has broken through, reaching Major Mastery.]

[Flowing Water Sword Art (Major Mastery): 1/150]
[Light Body Art (Major Mastery): 1/150]

"The Hardness of the Sword!"
A chilling aura emanated from Yang Ji. He rode the wind, his figure transforming into a swift gust, condensing his sword qi into a water droplet-sized point, and charged forward with his sword.

Woosh!
A sword pierced the air.
*Squelch!*
Instantly, a different sound echoed—not the usual clanging of metal on stone, but a clear yet muffled squelch.
"This sound..." Yang Ji was startled, sensing something was wrong. He immediately looked over and saw a tiny point of blood-red light emerge on the crab's abdomen, strikingly conspicuous.
Blood?
It's injured? My sword broke its defense?
*Hiss, hiss!*
Struck directly in the abdomen, the Overlord Crab's large mouth emitted a faint, sharp hiss, and the word [PAIN] appeared above its head.
"It really is injured," Yang Ji's pupils constricted, and his heart trembled.
Before the Overlord Crab could fly into a rage, he swiftly retreated.

The Overlord Crab quickly glanced at its lower abdomen. The wound wasn't obvious, and [CONFUSION], [DID HE JUST STAB ME?] appeared above its head.
Seeing its confusion, Yang Ji knew that the sword qi he had condensed in that strike was like a steel needle, piercing into its body, similar to a bee sting. While it caused a slight ache, it wasn't fatal.
However, a wave of ecstasy surged in Yang Ji's heart. If the Major Mastery Flowing Water Sword Art could injure it, then could the Perfected Flowing Water Sword Art slay it?

With one effective strike, to prevent the Overlord Crab from becoming wary and escaping, Yang Ji immediately pulled back, deciding not to use the Hardness of the Sword again.
Without waiting for it to react further, he swiftly charged back in, but this time he held back, deliberately putting himself at a disadvantage.
The Overlord Crab had been momentarily confused after being stabbed, but seeing the situation turn in its favor, it quickly cast Yang Ji's previous strike out of its mind.
The man and the crab resumed their battle.

Just like that, days passed.
Yang Ji had been on Desolate Isle for over a month now.
And on this very day, the long-awaited notification rang out again.

[You continuously use the Flowing Water Sword Art. You comprehended the true essence of blending hard and soft, and the vastness of flowing water. Your Flowing Water Sword Art has broken through, reaching Perfected.]
[You continuously use the Light Body Art. Within "riding the wind," you comprehended "white crane ascending to the heavens," allowing you to move in a straight line with the momentum of a soaring white crane, significantly increasing your speed. Your Light Body Art has broken through, reaching Perfected.]

[Flowing Water Sword Art (Perfected)]
[Light Body Art (Perfected)]

After a month of life-and-death combat, these two low-level techniques finally reached the Perfected stage.
Yang Ji's expression brightened. As he looked at the Overlord Crab, a sharp glint flashed in his eyes.
"Blending hard and soft, vast flowing water. I wonder if the Perfected Flowing Water Sword Art can pierce through this fellow's bronze armor with one strike."
Seeing Yang Ji suddenly stop, his gaze growing increasingly cold, the Overlord Crab hissed from its mouth, and an inexplicable surge of restlessness and unease arose in its heart.

At this moment, Yang Ji seemed to have transformed into a primeval beast, making the crab feel uneasy. A warning sign suddenly appeared in its mind. The next moment, it scrambled its legs and turned to flee.

"Trying to run?" Yang Ji's eyes darkened. At this point, how could he let it escape? Even if it took exhausting it to death, he would.
His figure now like a diving white crane, he raised his sword and pursued with extreme speed.
Spiritual energy surged madly within his body, pouring into the Sky-Soaring Sword. Sword qi erupted, emitting unmatched sharpness, and the vast power of a surging river instantly permeated the air, enveloping the Overlord Crab.
This sword strike carried the momentum of overturning mountains and seas. The sword light whistled, reaching its peak speed.

*Squelch!*
The sword pierced the Overlord Crab's rear shell, the entire blade plunging in without the slightest obstruction.
*Hiss, hiss, hiss!*
The Overlord Crab cried out in pain, its body trembling. It violently launched itself from the ground, and with a splash, carrying a trail of blood, it plummeted into the sea.
"Too late to run now!" Overjoyed by the sword's immense power, Yang Ji quickly jumped into the sea, chasing it down.

Hearing the splash, the Overlord Crab glanced back, its body trembling, its demonic soul jolting. [DAMN IT], [THE HUMAN HAS GROWN STRONGER], [HE'S CHASING ME].

"Where do you think you're going?" Yang Ji cultivated the Water-Surging Art, allowing him to move like a fish in water, his movements unhindered.
Seeing the Overlord Crab fleeing rapidly through the water ahead, he raised his hand and launched a sword attack through the endless seawater. With a ripping sound, the sword qi tore through the water and slammed into the Overlord Crab's back.
Immediately, its bronze armor cracked, and blood seeped out, once again staining a large area of the sea.

[TERROR], [WHAT TO DO?], [ESCAPE TO THE STONE CAVE] appeared in the Overlord Crab's eyes.
"Escape to the stone cave?" Yang Ji raised an eyebrow and charged forward at extreme speed. He feared unforeseen complications, so it would be best to slay it mid-pursuit.
He immediately raised his sword and unleashed several more sword qi strikes.
*Ching, ching, ching!*
The sword qi tore through the water, continuously striking the Overlord Crab's body. In an instant, its bronze armor kept cracking, severely damaging its vital energy.

"This guy's health bar is really thick. How is it not dead yet?" Yang Ji watched its eighteen thick legs continuously propel it through the water, still full of vigor and showing no signs of impending death, feeling utterly surprised.
It seemed the sword qi couldn't stop.
*Ching, ching, ching!*
Countless sword qi attacks rained down.

After chasing it for a full two li, the Overlord Crab was riddled with wounds, its body mangled.
Only then did [DEATH COUNTDOWN: 30 BREATHS] appear above its head.
Just then, a continuous stretch of reefs appeared ahead, like a mountain range blocking the way. There were numerous cave entrances, suggesting a network of interconnected passages within, a hidden grotto-heaven.
If the Overlord Crab were to slip in there, it would indeed be difficult to kill.

However, now it only had twenty-five breaths left to live. Even if it burrowed in, it wouldn't get far.
*Whoosh!*
Yang Ji accelerated, cutting through the water, and followed the Overlord Crab into one of the cave entrances.
The passage inside the cave was not dark. The surfaces of the stone walls along the way were covered with inch-high luminous grass, casting a faint light within.
After several twists and turns in the passage, Yang Ji followed the Overlord Crab to a cave chamber filled with aquatic plants.

The Overlord Crab turned its head and glared at Yang Ji, then immediately drooped its eyelids and breathed its last.
"This fellow, glaring at me even in death," Yang Ji smiled faintly, finally letting out a sigh of relief.
It had been a month, and he had only hunted two demonic beasts. Now he truly understood the difficulty of cultivators venturing out.
Indeed, what one saw was not necessarily one's own to claim. If his techniques hadn't reached the Perfected stage, he truly wouldn't have been able to defeat this Overlord Crab.
But the outcome was good.

Looking at the enormous corpse before him, he began to dismember it. The bronze armor, the eighteen thick legs, the two large claws, and the demonic core were the four most valuable parts.
Yang Ji quickly processed them, even putting the crab meat into his storage bag.
With the Overlord Crab's massive body no longer obstructing it, a faint red glow immediately rose from the ground.
Yang Ji looked down and found a fiery red stone where the Overlord Crab had been lying. Its surface was worn smooth, clearly indicating it was the crab's frequent sleeping stone bed.
