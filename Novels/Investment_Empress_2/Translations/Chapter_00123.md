# Chapter 123: The Blood Phoenix Secret Realm Opens

“Yin Huacheng is dead?”

This news was like a stone thrown into a calm lake, causing waves of shock to ripple through the crowd.

Yin Huacheng was the highest-ranking cultivator among the Clear Abyss Sect disciples present. Few people here could claim to be a sure match for him.

Dead?!

“He is truly dead. He died just outside the manor, and his body has already been brought back.”

Judging by the pale faces of the Disciples of the Burning Jade Forest, Yin Huacheng hadn't just died—he had died miserably.

For a moment, countless eyes turned toward the direction of the Clear Abyss Sect group.

However, most of the Clear Abyss Sect members wore calm expressions, showing none of the anger or agitation one might expect. It was as if a stranger had died.

It was Li Mo who spoke with a grave expression: “I think there must be something suspicious about this matter. We should go take a look.”

...

The wind and rain continued to fall. Tonight would undoubtedly be a sleepless night.

In the front hall of Dongli Manor, a straw mat was laid out, with faint traces of blood seeping through. If one didn't know this was Yin Huacheng, it would be hard to tell that this was even a human body.

“How tragic.”

“Who... who could have done this?”

“I can’t even tell what kind of weapon was used. It definitely wasn't a sword.”

“Hiss... A mighty Fifth Step of the Observation Realm, and he didn't even have a chance to cry for help. He was killed in a single blow!”

The crowd began to议论纷纷 (discuss heatedly), faces filled with fear, suspicion, and uncertainty.

Yin Huacheng was considered a strong expert within the Observation Realm. Yet, he had been crushed as easily as a chicken.

“We’ve already sent someone to notify the Elders.”

“Senior Brother Ouyang, what do you think?”

“Brother Tie, and you?”

Luo Yu looked at the two men.

One of them was the disciple with the second-highest cultivation level in the Clear Abyss Sect, also the Chief Disciple of the Ruyi Peak.

Tie Qi was not only the Chief Disciple of the Gang Dou Sect but also an experienced hunter.

“The killer didn't use Internal Qi, nor did they use Intent or Soul power,” Ouyang said. He was a young man with a somewhat sorrowful expression, shaking his head as he looked at Yin Huacheng’s corpse.

No Intent?

No Internal Qi?

Did that mean Yin Huacheng was beaten to death with brute force?

Hiss...

The sound of people gasping in shock filled the hall.

To kill an Observation Realm cultivator with brute force—was that something a human could do? It was too brutal.

“The killer’s weapon was... a hammer!”

“And the killer only made one move.”

“The perpetrator is likely an assassin from the Drizzle Tower. They practice an extremely tyrannical body-refining method.”

Tie Qi’s expression was heavy as could be. He could only deduce this much, as he hadn't witnessed the scene personally.

“A hammer?”

“Killed with a single hammer strike?”

“The Drizzle Tower?”

The crowd looked at each other in dismay. Those with weaker stomachs swallowed their saliva.

The arrogance on Bai Jinghong’s face had vanished, and he was silently calculating the situation. The more he calculated, the paler his face became.

If he had been in Yin Huacheng’s place, his fate would likely have been the same.

He knew that Yin Huacheng had also cultivated a body-refining technique. In terms of physical strength, he was slightly stronger than Bai Jinghong.

Could there really be such a terrifying existence in this small Eastern Wilderness?

“It’s the Hammer King of the Northwest!” a young, tender girl's voice spoke up at that moment.

What was that?

Everyone looked toward Luo Yao, who had just spoken.

“That’s right, it’s the Hammer King of the Northwest.”

“I’ve seen him in action before. He crushed the Night Ghost Liu Heng into a pile of mush with a single hammer.”

“And judging by his voice, he shouldn’t be very old. Probably a big brother.”

Luo Yao raised her little face, looking quite proud of herself.

...

Luo Yu fell into deep thought. Previously, he had been dismissive of the existence of the Hammer King of the Northwest, but now he truly began to doubt himself.

Everyone else also fell into a fearful silence, lost in thought.

A brutally vicious assassin from the Drizzle Tower, who liked to crush people to death with a hammer, was nearby.

By convention, they should have been filled with righteous indignation, saying a few polite words and promising to assist the Clear Abyss Sect in capturing the killer to save face.

But no one dared to.

What if the killer hadn't gone far?

“In broad daylight, under a clear sky!” an extremely angry voice rang out.

Everyone was stunned for a moment, looking out at the pitch-black night and the howling wind and rain.

“Daring villain! How dare you ambush and kill a disciple of my sect!”

“I, Li Mo, swear enmity with him forever!”

The young man finished eating his watermelon, smashed it on the ground, and spoke with righteous indignation.

The young heroes present all felt a bit embarrassed. Just moments ago, they had been terrified and hadn't dared to make a sound.

Look at him—how open and honorable, how noble, how willing to be the first to act for justice.

They had heard that this true disciple, Li Mo, was eager to help the just and hated evil with a passion. The rumors were indeed true!

“Brother Li is straightforward!”

“Brother Li, he has no faults!”

The hall erupted in cheers. Someone gave a thumbs-up, and others applauded loudly.

But the cheers stopped quickly.

Because... the wind and rain outside seemed to have suddenly stopped?

No, the wind and rain hadn't stopped; all the raindrops were frozen in place, unable to fall.

It was the Domain of an Inner Scene expert.

Yin Huaxuan walked in with a deadpan expression, but his aura was like that of a furious lion.

Beside him followed many Inner Scene experts from the Purple Sun Mansion.

Just moments ago, they had searched the area within a hundred miles, not letting even a fly escape, but they hadn't found a single trace.

If the other party hadn't flown away with wings, there was only one possibility.

“Come out.”

“I already know about you.”

His voice echoed, deafening. Almost everyone lost their composure at that moment; the imposing aura pierced straight into their hearts.

Everyone felt as if they had a fishbone stuck in their throat, their secrets exposed and nowhere to hide.

Li Mo also felt as if he were being stared at by a fierce beast.

But he felt no disturbance in his heart.

Is that it? It’s far inferior to my Master.

Yin Huaxuan’s gaze lingered on Li Mo for a moment.

He remembered that when they left the sect, Yin Huacheng had a conflict with this boy?

But...

This boy is good at swordplay, and he’s only at the Internal Qi Realm...

“Elder Yin Huaxuan, the killer may not necessarily be here.”

“Who knows what strange methods the assassins of the Drizzle Tower have to escape.”

“My Burning Jade Forest will assist you in the investigation with all its strength,” the middle-aged man in a Confucian robe spoke, breaking the oppressive atmosphere.

“That person might be here for the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.”

“Indeed. They will likely show up inside the secret realm. If my disciples get any information, we will definitely share it with you.”

The other Inner Scene experts also voiced their agreement.

“Yao’er.”

“You’ve seen the person. Come tell us about his characteristics.”

After all, the incident had happened within the territory of the Burning Jade Forest.

They attached great importance to the death of a true disciple from the Clear Abyss Sect.

That night, the elite disciples of the sect were dispatched, and several Inner Scene experts were mobilized, causing a huge uproar. For a time, Qinghe County was filled with panic, and even petty crimes ceased.

But no matter how big the commotion was, there were few results.

Moreover, Qinghe County was no longer dominated solely by them. Some forces, though not rooted in the Purple Sun Mansion, were not something they could thoroughly investigate.

From the start, this massive operation was doomed to be much noise but little substance.

Besides, the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm was about to open.

At that time, more than just a true disciple would die.

The next day.

Red Maple Mountain, fifty miles outside Qinghe County.

The maple leaves here bloomed all year round, maintaining this blood-red color in all four seasons. Today, the red seemed even more enchanting, as if it wanted to dye the layers of clouds.

It was unknown if this had anything to do with the Blood Phoenix that had fallen here.

Now, clouds were gathering from all sides. Countless martial artists from all over were converging here.

The secret realm was about to open.
