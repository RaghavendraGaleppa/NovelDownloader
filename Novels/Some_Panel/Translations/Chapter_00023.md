# Chapter 23: Beast Fire News

Time flew by, and two years passed in a flash.

During this period, Yang Ji cultivated with an abundant supply of high-grade Spiritual Splendor Pills, leading a rather comfortable life. As expected, his cultivation reached the seventh level of Qi Condensation.

[Realm: Qi Condensation Seventh Layer (450/6400)]

In these two years, nothing significant happened; everything was as usual. However, a small incident occurred today, two years later.

The Mo Family's shop approached Myriad Treasure Pavilion. Yang Ji initially thought it was because the quality of his pills was too good, snatching the Mo Family's business. Upon asking, Jin Dafu told him that while the pills he refined were of better quality, Myriad Treasure Pavilion sold them for 520 spirit stones per bottle, a price they maintained. The two families' overall pill prices were different, and their consumer bases were different, so there wasn't much direct competition.

Upon further inquiry, Yang Ji learned that it was He Gu who, enraged that the pills sold by Myriad Treasure Pavilion were of better quality than those he refined, came to challenge them. The target of his challenge was clear: Huoyuan, the one who refined the pills. Having advanced to become a peak alchemist, Huoyuan had finally caught up to He Gu, who had always been ahead of him. Naturally, feeling proud, Huoyuan couldn't stand the provocation. Thus, a contest unfolded between him and He Gu. The two publicly refined pills in the South Wind Island Plaza, attracting many cultivators to watch.

Yang Ji naturally couldn't be bothered to watch such a minor spectacle, and the result remained unknown to him. However, in the evening, he saw Huoyuan return, his face beaming, humming a small tune. Yang Ji knew then that Huoyuan had won. Of course, this was also within his expectations. After all, the pill formula given to Huoyuan had been meticulously improved by him, with a nearly perfect medicinal liquid ratio, resulting in higher quality pills. His victory was no surprise.

On the same day that Huoyuan was delighted, Yang Ji also received good news. Jin Dafu had finally collected forty portions of spiritual herbs for refining Spirit Origin Pills from various places. Spirit Origin Pills were mid-grade pills, several times better than Spiritual Splendor Pills. If he had Spirit Origin Pills to consume, Yang Ji's cultivation would undoubtedly progress much faster.

At this moment, holding the spiritual herbs and pill formula he had just acquired from Jin Dafu, he impatiently entered the alchemy chamber. With a sweep of his storage bag, he produced an alchemy furnace. After enlarging it, he fully enveloped it with the earth fire and began warming the furnace. Taking advantage of this interval, Yang Ji began to study the pill formula, memorizing the order of herb placement, then took out the spiritual herbs to examine them.

One portion of spiritual herbs for refining Spirit Origin Pills cost three thousand spirit stones. Forty portions amounted to a full 120,000 spirit stones. It had taken Jin Dafu over two years to collect just forty portions, which showed how precious these aged spiritual herbs were. Firstly, these spiritual herbs grew slowly and required many years to mature. Secondly, these high-grade cultivation resources were controlled by major families and the three great sects, who would not release many of them to the outside world. After all, high-grade cultivation resources meant faster cultivation, and faster cultivation meant outrunning one's natural lifespan limit, which in turn meant a longer life. Thus, high-grade cultivation resources were equivalent to life itself; anything tied to one's life was undeniably precious. Upon inquiring, Yang Ji also learned that Jin Dafu had only managed to acquire these few tens of portions by relying on his connections. Therefore, he treated them with far greater solemnity than he had when refining Spiritual Splendor Pills.

An incense stick's worth of time passed, and Yang Ji had thoroughly reviewed both the pill formula and the spiritual herbs in his hand. Once everything was ready, he patted the furnace lid and tossed in a Spirit Origin Fruit. However, as time passed, his brows furrowed deeper and deeper. He discovered that although the Spirit Origin Fruit in the furnace fire had melted, its medicinal efficacy had not reached its optimal level, and there were many impurities within that the furnace fire simply could not refine.

Yang Ji frowned and stared intently: [The spiritual energy contained within the earth fire is insufficient to melt out the Spirit Origin Fruit's maximum medicinal efficacy. Current efficacy: 60%. Impurities: 60%.]

"Insufficient spiritual energy in the earth fire?" Yang Ji was startled. This wasn't a problem of the fire not being strong enough; the Spirit Origin Fruit had melted, indicating the temperature was clearly sufficient. It was just that the medicinal efficacy within the spiritual fruit could not be fully released.

"Only sixty percent of the medicinal efficacy is released. Refining forty portions would mean losing nearly half." Yang Ji shook his head. Such a loss was clearly unacceptable to him, so he immediately collected the Spirit Origin Fruit liquid from the alchemy furnace into a container. Spiritual herbs for refining mid-grade spirit pills were already hard to find; losing over half was not what he wanted. He had no choice but to seek another method.

Yang Ji put away his alchemy furnace and walked out with a depressed expression. Huoyuan, seeing this, his eyes immediately gleamed, came up with a smile and said, "Master, did you encounter a problem with your alchemy?"

"Hmm?" Yang Ji's depressed expression paused, because he saw seven words above Huoyuan's head: [Hehe, not enough spiritual energy, right?]

*This old man guessed the problem I encountered with this alchemy session?*

He sure did!

Although Huoyuan's alchemy skills were mediocre, he had lived for decades and seen much, so it was plausible he could deduce the flaw of insufficient earth fire spiritual energy. Yang Ji glanced at him, sighed, and then spoke: "As you might have guessed, this earth fire simply cannot thoroughly melt the Spirit Origin Fruit."

"Master, I know of a type of flame that can definitely melt the Spirit Origin Fruit completely," Huoyuan suddenly said with a mysterious chuckle.

"Spirit fire? Or beast fire?" Yang Ji gave him a faint glance and asked casually. His expression didn't change much, as he knew that only these two types of flames, which contained more spiritual energy, could thoroughly melt the Spirit Origin Fruit. However, both spirit fire and beast fire were extremely difficult to find. The former, spirit fire, born between heaven and earth, was exceptionally rare. Whenever news of one spread, alchemists would surely flock to it with their people. The latter, beast fire, was similar. As soon as a demonic beast possessing beast fire was discovered, alchemists would certainly set their sights on it. This was because these two types of flames were essential for becoming a high-grade alchemist. The inability of the Spirit Origin Fruit to be thoroughly melted by earth fire clearly demonstrated the importance of flames to an alchemist.

"Hehe, Master, you don't need to be discouraged. I know the whereabouts of a beast fire," Huoyuan said with a fawning smile.

"Oh?" A flicker of surprise appeared in Yang Ji's eyes as he looked up and stared at Huoyuan. "Tell me about it."

"Ten years ago, I ventured out to sea with someone to search for spiritual herbs. That night, I witnessed a miraculous scene on the surface of the ocean. Although the full moon was like a disc that night, casting its light everywhere, I noticed that the moonlight on the nearby sea surface was particularly dense. The moonlight first descended softly, wisp by wisp, like green smoke. Eventually, it surged downwards like thick smoke, directly plunging into the seabed.

"Astonished, I steered my Water-Traveling Boat down into the sea to investigate. I discovered that the surging lunar essence entering the sea was being entirely absorbed by a small sun. And that small sun was none other than a Level 7 Blazing Sun Beast lurking deep within the ocean. As it opened its mouth to absorb the lunar essence, I knew it was about to break through. Because whenever a Blazing Sun Beast breaks through, it needs to absorb lunar essence to regulate the raging Blazing Yang energy within its body. This is also its weakest moment.

"Gathering my courage, I immediately approached and launched an attack on it. However, the Blazing Sun Beast was extremely vigilant. Sensing danger, it disregarded the critical moment of its breakthrough and plunged deep into the seabed. Sitting in my Water-Traveling Boat, I wanted to kill it while it was weakened from its breakthrough, so I continued the chase. But the Blazing Sun Beast was very fast. After escaping into an underwater volcano, it vanished.

"Because I am an alchemist, I couldn't forget about this Blazing Sun Beast. I waited on the ocean for a full year, but it never reappeared. It wasn't until I came to Myriad Treasure Pavilion and had access to earth fire that I gradually forgot about it. But just now, seeing Master frustrated with alchemy, those old memories instantly resurfaced," Huoyuan laughed.

"This was ten years ago?" Yang Ji frowned. "It's been ten years already. Is that Blazing Sun Beast still there?"
