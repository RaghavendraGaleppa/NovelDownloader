# Chapter 287: Thump~ (1/2)

The battle nearby was a one-sided affair.

It was shocking. The Venerable Huai Kong, a seventh-level Profound Palm expert who commanded a Great Dao, had only slightly exerted his power, and the demons of the Southern Domain were already trembling in fear. Yet now, he was being suppressed by a demoness, utterly unable to fight back!

To be honest, Li Mo was feeling quite uncomfortable.

He had just used his Eye of Providence and understood the two who had suppressed their feelings for over a thousand years. He wanted to leave, but he was afraid the sound of getting up would disturb the two across from him.

He looked at the Ice Cube and noticed a stray strand of her hair, blown by the mischievous breeze to the corner of her lips.

So, he casually tucked it behind her ear.

"Ice Cube, your ears are a bit hot."

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and removed the hand that had brushed past her lips and rested on her ear.

"The weather has turned cold; I've caught a chill."

"A chill?"

Li Mo really wanted to believe her.

But he still remembered that her room used to be cold enough to freeze ice cakes. If she could catch a cold, that would truly be a ghost story.

Looking at her moist, glistening lips, Li Mo felt his own ears must be burning right now.

It seemed he had caught the same chill as her.

"Ice Cube..."

Li Mo's eyes were as firm as Mu Rongxiao claiming he would quit lust.

"Hm?"

Ying Bing's beautiful eyes widened, her frosty jade face freezing in place.

At this moment, the supreme martial arts and the path to immortality in the Empress Feng Tian's mind seemed to turn into pink bubbles, popping and vanishing without a trace.

She could move like a fleeting light or a passing shadow in an instant.

But watching the young man close his eyes and lean in...

She only had time to close her eyes as well...

*Thump—*

A very crisp sound.

"Ouch..."

Their foreheads had an intimate collision.

Li Mo covered the spot that had bumped together. He had a hard head; the pain was completely negligible, but why did his heart ache so much he couldn't breathe?!

Especially when he saw the girl across from him, her fair forehead now flushed, her eyes losing focus, looking less cold and more dazed...

"Should we try again..."

"No."

"..."

Li Mo regretted reading so many novels now. If he hadn't read so much, wouldn't his first kiss have been given away by now?!

Who said you have to close your eyes to kiss?!

Those damn novel writers ruined me!

"Does it hurt a lot?"

"It's fine."

"Really?"

The Ice Cube was expressionless and not smiling at all; she definitely didn't look fine!

Hmm...

Actually, Ying Bing's expressionlessness was initially because she was stunned, but later her thoughts were in a mess. She had already recalled the sensation of their lips touching last time.

Just thinking about it was a bit...

If it had really happened just now, would she even need to activate the system for the next ranking?

Facing him, she probably wouldn't even be able to lift her sword. According to the system's comprehensive power comparison, could she win?

Ying Bing suddenly understood a little.

Why the Venerable Huai Kong, a Profound Sage, was suppressed so severely by Shang Qinqing, who had fallen from the seventh level.

There was a whole level of difference, and there wasn't even a chance of winning!

The sound of that 'thump' was particularly harsh.

Now, the Venerable Huai Kong and Shang Qinqing couldn't pretend they hadn't noticed the two of them, treating them as if they were air.

"The little ones are watching."

Shang Qinqing shot Huai Kong a flirtatious glance and reluctantly let go of him.

Venerable Huai Kong: "..."

You knew long ago, and now you're being shy?

Amitabha, my sins, my sins.

"This old monk doesn't remember what just happened..."

"Hm?"

"Qinqing, I am still the Abbot."

Huai Kong let out a heavy sigh.

As long as no one takes over his burden, he cannot return to secular life.

---

"I've waited for you; I've waited a thousand years."

"This karmic connection might... not take too long."

Venerable Huai Kong said with a complex expression.

In any corner of the Xuankong Temple, even if he didn't deliberately investigate, he knew everything that was happening.

He knew about Mu Rongxiao giving the prayer beads to Li Mo, and he also knew about the Buddhist scripture Li Mo gave to Mu Rongxiao.

A moment later, Huai Kong took off his turban and turned to leave.

After exchanging a few glances, Shang Qinqing hid the tenderness in her eyes and put on that carefree look again.

When she walked over, she saw the young man and woman being somewhat silent. She couldn't hide the smile on her face. Presumably, she wasn't hungry, as she didn't even take out any melon seeds to eat. She said with a beaming smile:

"Oh, Little Bing'er, why are you two here?"

"We just arrived,打算 saying goodbye to you. We were just figuring out which path is faster."

Li Mo said with a normal expression.

It wasn't that he was good at pretending nothing happened; mainly, he had seen something he shouldn't have. He figured their 'intimate contact' had also been seen by others.

Those who know, know. It's a tacit understanding.

"Tsk tsk, Shang Wu was actually able to teach a disciple like you; that's rare."

Shang Qinqing looked him up and down, clicking her tongue in amazement.

"Does Clan Leader Shang know my Master?"

"More than know her. Back then, I was only at the seventh rank, hadn't even taken human form, and almost got plucked and stewed by her."

"..."

Li Mo was speechless for a moment.

He decided to mention his Master less when going out in the future. His Master's old acquaintances might not only be powerful but also have met her in a not-so-pleasant way.

"Don't overthink it. Her temperament... it's not hard to understand..."

Shang Qinqing shook her head and didn't delve deeper into the topic.

She reached out and pointed at the map, drawing a line on it.

"You two take this path back to Nanguan City."

"Isn't this... a huge detour?"

Li Mo's eyes followed the route she pointed, feeling a bit puzzled. It was a full twice as long as the path he took to get here, because it wasn't a straight line but made several large bends.

But Li Mo was never stupid.

After a slight turn of his mind, he blurted out:

"Because of the Jade Phoenix God?"

Mu Rongxiao had also warned him.

This return journey was destined to be unpeaceful.

"It's not just the Jade Phoenix God. You two yourselves are also a reason."

"I won't be able to help you openly at that time. I can only guarantee that those who find you won't be worse than a fourth-level demon king-level calamity beast."

Shang Qinqing wore a smile, but her words were quite domineering.

"Thank you, Clan Leader Shang."

Li Mo understood the implication in her words.

That there might be encounters with great demons?

Demons revere the first level, while human martial artists revere the ninth level; the two are opposite.

A great demon is equivalent to an Inner Scenery expert in the human race, and usually, a fifth-level calamity beast is stronger than an Inner Scenery expert.

But she had already helped; he couldn't ask for more.

Moreover, how can a martial artist avoid experiencing storms and rain?

He said "thank you," but there was no response for a long time.

When Li Mo looked up again, he found that not only Shang Qinqing was gone, but the nearby Marriage Tree, the Buddhist halls, and the ancient pagoda had all vanished.

There was only a bare mountain peak, as if it were a great dream.

He quickly turned his gaze, and his mood immediately calmed down.

"Ice Cube, we're going home."

Li Mo's fingers moved. He wanted to reach out, but he remembered the awkwardness from just now.

"Mm."

An inexplicably cool and soft little hand filled his palm, and he subconsciously gripped it tight.

He looked at the strange and beautiful scenery of the Southern Domain. All distracting thoughts, like worries, vanished without a trace, leaving him feeling the world was vast and lofty.

The return journey is long.

Fortunately, he doesn't have to walk it alone.

Ying Bing gazed at the young man's profile, seeming to...

Think the same thing?
