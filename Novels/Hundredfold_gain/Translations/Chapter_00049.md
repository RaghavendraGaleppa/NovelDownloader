# Chapter 49: The Shabby Market and Broken Spirit Beads  

"About several miles southwest of Black Serpent City, there's another market? Alright, I understand."  

Qi Chuan nodded slightly upon hearing Murong Fan's words. After delivering this information, Murong Fan didn't linger. With another cupped-fist salute, he turned and left.  

Watching Murong Fan's figure disappear into the distance, Qi Chuan turned his gaze toward the southwest. In that direction, there seemed to be a stretch of low hills covered in dense thickets.  

At first glance, the area appeared desolate and uninhabited. However, it was common for markets in the cultivation world to be situated away from mortal settlements.  

"Since there's a market nearby, I might as well stop by and see if I can sell this half-destroyed top-grade magical artifact," Qi Chuan mused to himself.  

The artifact in his possession had lost all its inscribed formations and was completely unusable. It could only be dismantled for raw materials. Since the primary materials were mostly ruined—let alone the secondary components—its value had plummeted. Still, it retained some worth.  

Given that he wouldn't be using it anytime soon, it made sense to exchange it for cultivation resources. The market was only a few miles away, so it wouldn't hurt to try his luck there.  

With that thought, Qi Chuan set off toward the hills. The short distance was quickly covered, and soon, he arrived at an inconspicuous valley hidden amidst the dense foliage. From afar, nothing seemed amiss about the place.  

Yet within the valley lay a small cultivation market.  

The market consisted of a single street lined with modest buildings housing various shops. These shops offered a range of goods—magical artifacts, talismans, pills, and more—though the quality was generally low. Most items were low- to mid-grade, with mid-grade being scarce and high-grade serving as prized displays.  

Along the street, rogue cultivators peddled their wares from makeshift stalls. Their goods were even shoddier, barely worth mentioning.  

"Can a place like this even handle a half-destroyed top-grade artifact?" Qi Chuan thought, slightly exasperated as he surveyed the scene.  

Though his artifact had lost much of its value, it still held some worth. These small, low-budget shops likely wouldn't offer a fair price.  

As for the rogue cultivators' stalls, their transactions weren't even conducted in standard low-grade spirit stones but in something even more inferior—broken spirit beads.  

Broken spirit beads were essentially the leftover scraps from cutting raw spirit stone ore into standard low-grade spirit stones. One low-grade spirit stone could be exchanged for ten broken spirit beads.  

It was clear what kind of business these rogue cultivators were running. If Qi Chuan were to pull out his half-destroyed top-grade artifact, he'd probably give them a heart attack.  

"I'll take a quick look around. If there's no good place to sell it, I'll just head back," Qi Chuan decided.  

He strolled down the street, weaving through the crowd of rogue cultivators. Since he wasn't wearing his inner sect robes from the Windmoon Sect, he didn't stand out—except for his youth, which contrasted with the mostly older cultivators around him.  

"Hmm? This shop seems decent."  

After a while, Qi Chuan paused in the middle of the street and glanced at a shop to his left. Its signboard read "Breeze Pavilion."  

The pavilion was a three-story structure, slightly taller and more refined than its neighbors. Its design and materials exuded an understated elegance, making it the most distinguished establishment in the valley market.  

A steady stream of rogue cultivators flowed in and out, suggesting bustling business. Given its apparent prosperity, it might have the means to take his artifact off his hands.  

Of course, if the offered price didn't meet his expectations, he could always walk away.  

"Let's take a look inside first."  

Qi Chuan stepped through the entrance and surveyed the first floor. Three counters were staffed by attendants assisting seven or eight cultivators with purchases of talismans and artifacts—all low-grade.  

"Esteemed guest, how may I assist you?"  

A nearby attendant noticed Qi Chuan and greeted him warmly. It wasn't that he recognized Qi Chuan's status—just standard customer service.  

"Do you only carry low-grade items here?" Qi Chuan asked, glancing around.  

"If you're looking for mid-grade items, please proceed to the second floor. For high-grade, the third floor," the attendant replied, his tone growing more respectful as he realized Qi Chuan was a serious buyer.  

"I see. Thank you."  

With that, Qi Chuan headed for the stairs.  

The second floor had only two customers browsing at a single counter. Uninterested, Qi Chuan continued to the third floor.  

There, he found a single counter manned by a balding old man who had been dozing off.  

Qi Chuan cleared his throat.  

The old man startled awake, blinked at Qi Chuan, and then immediately broke into a wide smile. "Esteemed guest! How may I serve you today?"  

He straightened up from his reclined position.  

"I'm not here to buy. Does Breeze Pavilion accept this?"  

Without preamble, Qi Chuan placed the half-destroyed artifact on the counter.  

"Of course! Though we'll need to inspect it first," the old man said, his eyes squinting as he examined the item.  

After a moment, his wrinkled hands trembled slightly, and his eyes widened. Upon closer inspection, he relaxed slightly and smiled.  

"If I'm not mistaken, this is a top-grade artifact—though heavily damaged. Its value has dropped significantly. Top-grade artifacts are usually well-maintained, and this doesn't seem like battle damage. May I ask where you acquired it?"  

Qi Chuan remained impassive. "Does Breeze Pavilion require sellers to disclose their sources?"  

The old man hastily waved his hands. "No, no! Just an old man's curiosity. I've never seen a top-grade artifact before—please forgive my rudeness."  

"In that case, name your price. How much will Breeze Pavilion offer?" Qi Chuan asked coolly.  

The old man hesitated, muttering to himself, "Even if it was top-grade, it's mostly ruined now... The primary materials are barely salvageable... It's not easy to repurpose..."  

Qi Chuan waited silently.  

After a long pause, the old man finally gritted his teeth. "How about... 180 low-grade spirit stones? We'd be taking a loss, but..."  

As he spoke, he subtly studied Qi Chuan's expression.
