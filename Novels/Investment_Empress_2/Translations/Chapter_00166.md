# Chapter 166: Trouble, the Ice Cube Seems Truly Angry

The rain didn't fall, but the atmosphere was now incredibly awkward.

Li Mo laughed for a while before realizing something was off. The feeling was wrong.

He疑惑地捏了捏, a bit high and prominent, a bit soft, with excellent elasticity...

Something was definitely wrong!

Little Li's gaze stiffened as it moved downward.

"!"

"This is actually a misunderstanding..." Li Mo's voice was dry.

Ying Ice's neck was blood-red, her face expressionless, her eyes deep and hazy as if shrouded in mist.

*Go on, I'm listening.*

"Ahem..."

Li Mo felt his scalp tingle under that gaze. He was now seriously considering whether he could stay in the Autumn Water Pavilion anymore. If he couldn't sleep with his eyes closed at night in the future, he'd be done for. He'd close them to sleep, and when he opened them again, they'd be open forever, wide and round like copper bells forever.

"It's just... skill approaching the Dao. The Great Dao has forty-nine paths, with one missing."

"The 'one' that was missing just now... it was just... right there."

Even Little Li didn't know if this explanation would make the Ice Cube believe him. He really was just practicing too seriously! And he never expected that the Ice Cube's weak point would actually be her... rear defenses.

Ying Ice's jade-like face became even colder and stiffer. The atmosphere grew even quieter. She didn't say anything else. Instead, she took a large-headed doll from her bosom.

*Huh?*

Li Mo was stunned. Why did this doll look so familiar?

*Snap—*

The Ice Cube twisted the doll's head right off, using quite a bit of strength.

Li Mo: "!"

Why did he suddenly feel a chill on his neck, along with a phantom pain? Wasn't this some kind of voodoo doll made with his hair or something?

But soon, he saw the Ice Cube put the Frost Sword inside and take out a ruler instead.

"Good thing this is a spatial object..."

"Again."

"Huh?"

A cold sweat suddenly broke out on Li Mo's back.

He saw Ying Ice say coldly: "I admit defeat for the previous round. I'll give you the wager. Think about what you want."

"Now, again."

"Again?!"

Before Little Li could even agree, the ruler was already slashing through the air.

Strange.

This time, Ying Ice's sword lacked that 'one', yet it came even more overbearing and imposing. Even if he used the Dugu Nine Swords, he couldn't find a way to counter it—at least not with his current beginner level.

And so.

For the next hour, Little Li's buttocks underwent a stormy beating.

*Slap—*

*Slap—*

*Slap—*

"What's that noise so early in the morning?"

Shang Wu poked her head out from upstairs. Seeing the scene in the courtyard, her languid face immediately woke up. She scratched the back of her head and yawned. "What kind of new game is this now..."

***

Not long after, the sparring ended.

Ying Ice put away the ruler and returned to her room.

Li Mo wanted to sit down on the reclining chair, but the Ice Cube's ruler had struck with penetrating force. Although he wasn't injured, even touching the spot hurt a bit.

*Sigh.*

In terms of swordsmanship, there was still quite a gap between him and the daughter of destiny. Although he was already very strong among his peers.

But what happened earlier? How did she suddenly have such an obvious weak point? Did she hold back?

Moreover...

At that time, he was completely focused on the thought: *I just reached the入门 level of the Dugu Nine Swords, how can I stand for this kind of humiliation?*

And then he got carried away.

"Yesterday she was even helping me scrub my back, now she's definitely angry..."

Li Mo felt a bit of a headache. The Ice Cube was his number one investor, after all.

***

She was basically his sugar mommy.

What should he do?

"The Ice Cube doesn't really have any likes or dislikes," Li Mo scratched his head, truly troubled.

Just then, the system notification suddenly rang:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Ying Ice', allowing her to discover the flaws in her sword technique.】

【Investment Feedback: One drop of Frost Origin Dew】

【Frost Origin Dew】: "The most ancient ice essence in the heavens and earth. It takes ten thousand years to condense a single liquid drop, known as Frost Origin Dew. It is a holy item for replenishing the soul and nourishing the spirit!"

***

On the other side.

After Ying Ice closed the door, she slowly walked to the Cold Marrow Jade Bed and sat down.

However, the moment she made contact, a numbing sensation, like electricity flowing through her, surged from the spot that had been beaten.

The breath Ying Ice had been holding in for a long time finally broke.

"Haa..."

She wanted to delete the scene from earlier from her mind completely.

But the system notification popped up again:

【Congratulations, Host, reward successfully claimed!】

"Hmph..."

Ying Ice pursed her lips and waved her sleeve forcefully, making the annoying text disappear.

After breathing for a long time, the strange feeling in her heart finally subsided somewhat.

Every time she ranked below Li Mo, there was not only the loser's penalty but also this inexplicable reward!

She absolutely could not, and should not, lose again.

Actually, Ying Ice still didn't know how Li Mo had ranked above her last time.

"How did I... let him hit me just now?"

"His swordsmanship suddenly became very strange."

"Is it because he touched the threshold of skill approaching the Dao?"

Ying Ice's eyes flickered with thought. She recalled for a moment, then shook her head.

No, that's not it.

He did touch the threshold, but it was just the threshold. Once she was no longer affected by external factors, he didn't have a chance to use that strange sword technique to exploit a gap.

The pestle hasn't seen him practice recently, so what was the reason?

She couldn't figure out the reason for the time being.

"The only thing I can do is make myself stronger."

Ying Ice took a deep breath. After all, the 'Divine Sky Heart Sword' was a divine technique, vast and profound, representing the highest level of martial arts in the nine heavens and ten lands. She couldn't master it thoroughly with just a superficial understanding; she needed to constantly verify and practice.

But just now...

After sparring with Li Mo, she found some of her own shortcomings.

"My first form still isn't perfectly seamless..."

As Ying Ice recalled, she summarized her experience from earlier. She couldn't avoid Li Mo's final sword strike, that move which couldn't even be called a sword technique...

The scenes and sensations she wanted to disperse could only constantly reappear in her mind...

***

Over the next few days.

Little Li's life became very simple. Observing the divine, tempering his soul, practicing the sword.

Since that day, the Ice Cube's ruler had never failed to make intimate contact with his buttocks.

Of course, there were benefits. His 'Dugu Nine Swords' was progressing towards proficiency.

One day.

Li Mo's consciousness sank into his dantian. Under the illumination of the Xuan Dan, the little figure materialized by his soul was covered in mysterious and complex divine patterns that were constantly forming and disappearing.

These were all carved on bit by bit after he observed the divine. In just a few days, the acupoints he had opened had been completely stabilized!

This was also thanks to the daily drop of Frost Origin Dew and the Empress凰天's Ascension to Immortality diagram.

"Everyone's soul can承载 different forms and spirits."

"The Ice Cube doesn't just observe one form."

"I wonder what other divine forms I'll have in the future."

Li Mo let out a soft breath.

Not long after, the door to the Autumn Water Pavilion was knocked.

It was a few unsurprising visitors.

"Senior Brother Li, we're setting off for Yunzhou now."

Ouyang, carrying a large bag of painting tools, called out in greeting.
