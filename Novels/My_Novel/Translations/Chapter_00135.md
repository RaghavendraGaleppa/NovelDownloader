Chapter 135: The Young Hero Pulls the Coffin into the City!

"This... this..." Li Xian exclaimed in shock.

A smile touched Madam Wen's lips as she thought to herself, *This child’s Transformed Physique is actually similar to mine. It seems there is hidden gold within common mud. He is of the same caliber as I.*

She had originally had no intention of nurturing Li Xian. However, as Li Xian revealed his capabilities step by step, he first satisfied her, then surprised her, and slowly, she began to harbor the thought of nurturing him. In the past, no matter how much effort she put into nurturing someone, Madam Wen would never have cared so deeply.

Today, she learned that Li Xian’s Transformed Physique was actually identical to her own. [Perfect Physique] was already rare, which was a source of Madam Wen's pride. One was rare enough, yet now a second had appeared, and it was right under her own command.

It made her think of the saying: a precious sword deserves a precious scabbard.

"Your Transformed Physique is extraordinary, but the path of martial arts still requires diligent study. I have been refining pills for over a month and am somewhat weary," Madam Wen said.

Li Xian stood up and said, "In that case, I shall take my leave." He turned to withdraw.

"When did I tell you to leave?" Madam Wen said lightly, the temperature instantly dropping.

"Then, Madam..." Li Xian felt a chill run down his spine, confused as he asked.

"You lack manners," Madam Wen chided softly. "If I am weary, what should you do?"

Li Xian thought, *This Madam Wen has a strange temperament; she is truly unpredictable. Since she said she is weary, naturally she should rest well. My leaving now should be the right thing to do. Since she won't let me leave, could it be... she wants me to help relieve her fatigue?*

His thoughts turned, and he asked, "Should I help relieve the Madam's fatigue?"

Madam Wen nodded and said, "A teachable child. Such mistakes must not be made again. If I say I am weary and you simply leave, that is disrespect."

"But I do not know how to relieve the Madam's fatigue," Li Xian asked.

Madam Wen patted the jade couch and said, "Come onto this couch and massage my shoulders. The method of kneading meridians and relaxing bones, you have likely not learned, so I won't demand too much of you today. Go seek out Qiu Yue for instruction tomorrow."

"Once I fall asleep, you may leave. Remember, do not wake me, or you will be punished with a beating."

Left with no choice, Li Xian climbed onto the jade couch and began to massage her fragrant shoulders with both hands. Separated only by a thin layer of ice silk, the scent of the Madam's hair wafted to his nose.

Although he had not learned the method of kneading meridians and relaxing bones, as a martial artist, he inevitably had experience with falls and injuries, so he understood a thing or two about massage and manipulation.

Madam Wen slightly closed her eyes. Feeling the pressure on her shoulders, she had long known Li Xian's technique was crude but said nothing. However, this round of kneading gave her a unique feeling.

Usually, such tasks were handled by Qiu Yue.

Qiu Yue was close to her, serving her personally in daily life. Qiu Yue's technique was skilled, but it inevitably lacked a certain "flavor." Li Xian's technique was crude and very unskilled, which happened to hit the right "flavor."

Madam Wen had been famous since her youth and had never allowed a man to get close. Her entire body was filled with heavy Yin energy. Now, she had nurtured a young man. The invisible Yang energy烘照 (baked and illuminated) her back, and faint, wispy strands subtly tugged at her consciousness.

She felt incredibly comfortable, her mind wandering, completely relaxed.

This shoulder massage lasted late into the night.

The Madam lay on her side, her left arm propping up her head, long hair casually draped, her eyes closed in a light sleep.

Li Xian was stiff and拘谨 (reserved/timid) all over. Just as he wanted to withdraw his hands and leave, he sensed Madam Wen's eyelashes tremble slightly.

Li Xian frowned and suddenly thought:

*The Madam's thoughts are deep; every move she makes should be scrutinized. Her asking me to massage her shoulders is likely another test.*

*Now that I also have a [Perfect Physique], if I am not loyal to the Madam, I am a potential threat to her. At this moment, she appears to be asleep, but it is actually a test of me. If I leave halfway, while it cannot be said that I have two hearts, it shows my devotion to her is not strong enough.*

*Right now, I must continue to massage her shoulders and wait for her to wake up before leaving.*

Li Xian understood the key point.

He no longer hurried to leave, slowly continuing to massage Madam Wen's shoulders.

The next day.

Early morning.

Slanting sunlight shone in. Madam Wen's eyelashes trembled, and she woke naturally. Feeling the comfort in her shoulders, and realizing a pair of large hands were still pressing and kneading, she asked, "You haven't left yet?"

Li Xian said, "It is rare for me to be able to serve the Madam; I did not wish to leave, so I served through the night."

"You have shown great heart. Serving all night, you must be weary too. Go back and rest," Madam Wen said gently, her words clearly mixed with satisfaction.

Li Xian left the inner courtyard, stretched his waist, and circulated his vital energy and blood throughout his body. During the day yesterday, he had confronted the army, and at night, he had massaged the Madam's shoulders. He was exhausted in both body and mind.

"So my Transformed Physique is named [Perfect Physique]. It is actually the same as the Madam's. It seems this [Perfect Physique] should not be bad. Only, when the Madam revealed her physique, her body did not change, but I grew a red mole between my eyebrows."

Li Xian rubbed his shoulders, but no one was there to massage them for him.

He was too exhausted. Returning to his residence, he lay down on the bed and fell into a deep sleep.

Until noon, the door was knocked.

Ding Hu, supporting himself on crutches, came to find him to handle affairs of the manor. Li Xian ate some dry rations simply, knowing this matter could not be delayed, so he personally took charge to arrange and handle the various affairs of the manor.

He presented the list of the dead and injured to the Madam. The Madam waved her hand and said, "The dead defended the manor with merit; give ten taels to each." With a stroke of her vermilion brush, she brushed over the casualties.

After that came the patrol schedules, recruiting guards, recruiting servants... various matters.

Li Xian did not personally handle these trivial matters; he simply gave the direction and handed them over to Ding Hu to handle meticulously.

Speaking of another side.

Last night. Lin Guolong received the news that the twenty thousand troops of the Yellow Dragon Army had all been captured, and he was to send troops to take custody.

Lin Guolong originally did not believe it until the guards of the One Union Manor presented "Qi Biao's" head. Only then did he panic; a great fortune had fallen right before him.

He immediately sent troops to guard them and drafted a letter overnight to report to the court and the family forces.

This kept him busy for two days.

This morning, he finally came to a temporary pause and found time to relax.

Inside the Lin family residence.

In a man-made spring pool.

The surrounding garden scenery was exquisite, with rockeries and green willows, fresh and elegant.

Lin Guolong, light in spirit, lay in the water, surrounded by five beautiful concubines serving him well. Massaging his shoulders, scrubbing his back, feeding him fruit flesh, massaging his legs...

"I, Lin Guolong, have quelled the chaos. Hehe, I'd like to see who dares to look down on me in the future. Hmph, so what if I don't have the加持 (blessing) of fortune?" Lin Guolong said proudly.

"Master, I knew you were the most formidable," said the concubine massaging his shoulders sweetly.

"Of course," Lin Guolong said. "I have sent a message via carrier pigeon; the family should know of this great achievement by now. This military merit is truly immeasurable. Capturing twenty-one thousand eight hundred troops alive, I truly possess the demeanor of a great general!"

"Master, tell us, how did you capture them?"

The concubine massaging his legs, her body like a water snake,顺势 (taking the opportunity) threw herself into Lin Guolong's embrace.

Lin Guolong enjoyed the blessing of having many women, embracing the jade into his arms, laughing out loud, and said heartily, "Since you want to hear, then I shall reluctantly tell it again."

"That was truly extremely majestic. Speaking of that day, the great army pressed against the city, seeing the city gate about to fall, the enemy forces were unstoppable. If they entered the city, they would inevitably burn, kill, and loot; then neither you nor I could escape the disaster."

"At the moment the sky was about to collapse, I turned the tide, climbed the city wall with a long bow, drew the bow full like a full moon, and shouted: 'Qi Biao, you little old man, dare you catch my arrow!' Before the enemy leader could speak, this arrow was already shot."

"In an instant, the sky and earth darkened, the sun and moon hung upside down. One could say that peerless heroic stance was destined to be worshipped. With this arrow, how could that old thief still have life? Naturally, he perished instantly! But... relying on this alone, to make tens of thousands of soldiers truly surrender, is still far from enough. Do you know what I did next?"

The concubines' eyes were filled with admiration. "What did you do, Master~? Don't keep us in suspense, tell us quickly~"

One by one, their sweet pleas were like honey wrapping around the heart, making one forget oneself.

Lin Guolong felt an unspeakable pleasure, his scalp tingling, and said excitedly, "Such elite troops, such fierce tigers and wolves, how could they surrender easily. At this time, the dragon was headless, and the military heart was scattered. But although Qi Biao died, the Left Wing Guard was not dead."

"If the Left Wing Guard issued military orders, the ten thousand troops would continue to attack the city, and we would still have difficulty resisting."

"Right then, my heart was full of serving the country, with no other thoughts. I rushed into the enemy army alone and beheaded Qi Biao with a single slash. Holding the head high, I suppressed ten thousand soldiers with my presence alone. Adding fuel to the fire, this made the soldiers realize there was no hope, and they surrendered one by one, accepting their fate!"

The concubines listened, their hearts surging. To be able to see such a hero in a dream was already a blessing of three lifetimes.

"Master~, you are the county magistrate, one of the best in the county. We beg you, could you invite that Li Dalang to the府 (mansion) to sit?"

"Yes, Master, please invite Li Dalang."

The concubines pushed and shoved Lin Guolong.

Lin Guolong said, "Wait, you listen to my great achievements, why invite that irrelevant person?"

The concubines said, "Oh, it's nothing, we just want to see Li Dalang." They couldn't help but drift away in thought. The one who truly took the enemy general's head and crushed the ten thousand troops was Li Xian of the One Union Manor.

The eldest son of the Li family in Qingning County.

This was known throughout the county; Lin Guolong was just boasting.

"You shameless hussies, I haven't died yet, and you've already changed your hearts!" Lin Guolong roared.

He had lost the mood to soak in the water. Just then, a colorful bird beast landed on a willow branch.

Lin Guolong was startled. This was a Colorful Feather Bird, a strange bird specially bred by the family for communication, flying at incredible speed, able to recognize important family members, and knowledgeable about the counties and towns of Qiong Tian Mansion.

He caught the colorful bird beast.

"Replying so quickly? Usually, when I communicate with the family, it takes three to five days, or sometimes no reply at all."

"And it's this Colorful Feather Bird... such birds are extremely rare."

He opened the letter and read the contents.

"Oh my!"

"That young mistress is coming to my Qingning County soon?" Lin Guolong said in disbelief.

One family's joy is another's sorrow.

Leopard Blade Sect.

In a spacious courtyard, the sect's disciples practiced martial arts diligently.

Xu Liefeng's mind was wandering in the void. After learning of Qi Biao's death, he was panic-stricken, turning over and over in his mind, recalling if there were any flaws in his plan.

"I hid my appearance, hid my figure, and moved at night. No one should know what I did. Qi Biao did speak to me, but he is dead, with no witness. This matter... should just pass like this."

Thinking of this, he finally set his mind slightly at ease.

"Li Xian, have you handled the matter I asked you to do?"

In the One Union Manor.

Madam Wen asked.

Li Xian said, "It is done. The coffin has been bought, but I do not know for whom it is prepared."

Madam Wen waved her slender hand and said indifferently:

"Naturally, it is for Xu Liefeng."

"Prepare the carriage, and pull the coffin into the city!"
