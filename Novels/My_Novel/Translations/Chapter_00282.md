Chapter 282: Candle Sect’s Legacy, Nangong’s Shyness, Minor Accomplishment of the Viscera Sutra, Flawless Five Organs

Shi Yufei stroked his beard and laughed. He observed Li Xian’s handsome features and extraordinary bearing, revealing a heroic and uncommon demeanor. Although young and lacking in experience, he had great potential to be molded into a talent. Engaging in the lowly deeds of the Flower Cage Gate was truly unsuited to his noble presence. Shi Yufei thought that for Li Xian to merely be a flower thief was an immense waste. He recalled the "Candle Sect" and pondered it carefully... faintly feeling that Li Xian carried the legacy of the Candle Sect.

Li Xian asked, "The Candle Sect? I heard Elder Ye mention it once." Shi Yufei replied, "Oh? That is rare."

Shi Yufei had gray hair and a white braid, a square face, and bright eyes. At first glance, he looked benevolent, but upon closer inspection, he concealed an imposing aura. He was vastly different from the typical lecherous and cunning flower thieves.

Li Xian said, "Grand Chief... may I ask a bold question? That Poison Flower Taoist, Hao Qingshe, is so arrogant and unbridled. Is she perhaps a member of the Candle Sect?"

Shi Yufei said, "You are very smart. You must have sensed that Hao Qingshe has a special relationship with our Flower Cage Gate. Although she resides in the Longevity Water Altar, she does not accept our commands."

Shi Yufei stroked his beard and said, "Your speculation is correct. She is indeed from the Candle Sect."

Li Xian said, "But didn't the Candle Sect already..." Shi Yufei said, "The Candle Sect was destroyed, but its sparks scattered across the world. The remnants and diehards changed their identities, and it is not surprising that some descendants of the Candle Sect remain."

Li Xian understood. Shi Yufei continued, "The Poison Flower Taoist, Hao Qingshe... is unreasonable and overbearing. Over the years, she has acted willfully, capturing flower thieves to refine poisons and concoct medicines. This is a common occurrence. I tolerate her because of her Candle Sect identity."

"If you belong to the Candle Sect, her wild behavior will have to be restrained. If she refuses to be restrained, this old man will help her be restrained."

Li Xian said, "I am young and ignorant, how dare I compare myself to Senior Hao." Shi Yufei said, "Hao Qingshe is becoming increasingly excessive and is truly in need of discipline. But... she belongs to the remnants of the Candle Sect, and the Flower Cage Gate also belongs to the remnants of the Candle Sect."

"According to the sect's hierarchy... the Flower Cage Gate's status is not high. Ordinary disciples have little connection to the Candle Sect. Therefore, Hao Qingshe acts recklessly, capturing them to kill and refine, practicing toxic martial arts. If I were to stand up for them, according to Candle Sect rules, it would inevitably be seen as excluding sect members. Because of this concern, I have tolerated it for a long time."

"I truly dislike Hao Qingshe. So if you join the Candle Sect, I can rest easy and warn Hao Qingshe."

Li Xian sorted out the key points and suddenly realized: "In the mind of this Grand Chief, the Candle Sect is far more important than the Flower Cage Gate."

Shi Yufei smiled and said, "I see that your talent is exceptional, which is why I am telling you so much. However, wanting to join the Candle Sect is not an easy task."

Li Xian thought to himself: "Hao Qingshe is a remnant of the Candle Sect, acting viciously and perversely, which shows that the Candle Sect is not a group of good people. Am I jumping from one pirate ship to another?" He said, "Grand Chief... is the selection for the Candle Sect very strict?"

Shi Yufei smiled self-deprecatingly: "The Candle Sect was destroyed long ago, what selection is there? It's just some who refuse to give up, amusing themselves."

With that, he stopped talking about the Candle Sect.

The prizes for the champion of the grand event were three: merit money, rare treasures, and a beautiful companion. Shi Yufei, considering that Li Xian had almost lost his life, allowed him to choose a martial art and buy it at a reduced price.

Li Xian received his merit money and pondered deeply... The opportunity to choose a martial art was rare, so he should be careful and thoughtful. He wanted to delay for a few days to think about his future path. Shi Yufei stroked his beard and smiled, very appreciative. Being able to remain calm and composed in the face of great profit was indeed a rare quality.

He had important matters to attend to, so he did not insist, saying, "The rare treasures will take some time. Go and claim your beautiful companion first. Hahaha... young and vigorous, you need to be moderate."

He immediately called two maids to attend to him.

Li Xian watched him leave.

The two maids smiled and said, "Young Master Hua, please come with us. Your beautiful companion is waiting for you. That girl has a stubborn temper, you must teach her well."

Li Xian followed and smiled, "What is the name of this beautiful companion?"

The maids said, "Her surname is Nangong, given name Liuli. It is a good name, but... the female palace said she needs to be disciplined."

"Young Master Hua... you might not be clear about the rules regarding beautiful companions?"

Li Xian said, "Beautiful companions, are there rules for them?"

The two maids looked at each other, covered their mouths, and giggled, saying, "Naturally there are rules, and quite a few at that."

Li Xian smiled, "Then please enlighten me, two sisters." The two maids blushed and giggled, secretly glancing at Li Xian several times. At this moment, Li Xian’s true appearance was revealed, adding to his extraordinary handsomeness.

They said, "The so-called beautiful companion... is a unique rule of our Flower Cage Gate. The disciples of the Flower Cage Gate who enjoy a close beautiful companion are all those who have rendered meritorious service or have exceptional martial prowess."

"But if one cannot keep their beautiful companion, it is a great loss of face. If one can make the beautiful companion submit both physically and mentally, it will earn the elders' favor."

When Li Xian saw Nangong Liuli again, she was dressed in gorgeous clothes, with exquisite makeup, breathtakingly beautiful. Her hair was styled in a "Willow Cream Bun," decorated with red hairpins, white hair ornaments, and luxurious hairpins, making her look extremely grand and elegant. Her appearance was originally very beautiful, and her vision and experience were sufficient to carry this makeup, making her look even more dignified and appropriate.

Her jade shoulders were bare, draped with a light gauze shawl, and her jade shoes were delicate and charming.

She walked over gracefully.

Li Xian thought: "What a beauty... if according to the Flower Cage Gate's rules, such a rare beauty is indeed mine." His gaze was playful as he scrutinized her carefully.

Nangong Liuli glanced at Li Xian, felt a slight joy, but then couldn't help but feel sorrow and worry:

"Even if he won, he is better than a flower thief. But I have finally given myself to someone else and can only rely on him to live. I, Nangong Liuli, am a woman from a good family, but I have ended up like this. How can this be considered good?"

She sighed softly.

Two maids stood beside Nangong Liuli. The light in this path was dim, but Nangong Liuli’s ornaments shone brightly.

The accompanying maid said, "Young Master Hua... from today on, Nangong Liuli is your beautiful companion. You can do whatever you want with her."

Nangong Liuli’s pretty face turned bright red, and she dared not look at Li Xian. Her heart was filled with an inexplicable feeling, both expectant and resistant. When she thought of "do whatever you want," after thinking it over, it was just that kind of thing. Li Xian smiled and said, "Thank you for the service!" He led Nangong Liuli away.

Nangong Liuli’s steps were light and graceful. Wearing the "Flowing Gaze of Rainbows" dress, she did not dare to make any large movements. She walked behind Li Xian, her beautiful eyes examining him.

Just now, the Poison Flower Taoist had attacked aggressively, and poisonous mist had covered the arena. She was filled with despair, grieving for Li Xian’s tragic death and for her own fall into the hands of another villain. Later, seeing that he was unharmed and shining with brilliance, she couldn't help but feel ecstatic.

Her emotions fluctuated wildly. But now that the dust had settled, she felt extremely awkward and helpless. She even lamented that she hadn't learned the walking and sitting methods of the "Flowing Gaze of Rainbows" dress because she was too stubborn at the time. This was truly miserable.

Her mind was wandering. Suddenly, she took a slightly larger step, pulling the tiny needles of her dress. A tingling and numbing sensation pricked her ribs, back, and soles of her feet, an indescribable feeling. She was both scared and a bit strange, almost falling, but Li Xian reached out to support her.

They walked out of the pavilion. The sunlight shone on them, and a gentle breeze rustled.

The island had a mild climate, with lush flowers and green grass.

Li Xian smiled and said, "Miss Nangong, have you been well recently?" Nangong Liuli said resentfully, "How could I be well? I'm almost bullied to death." Li Xian said with concern, "Did they..."

"Ah!" Nangong Liuli quickly explained, "It's not what you're thinking." Li Xian smiled, "What am I thinking?" Nangong Liuli said, "What else could you be thinking? You must be thinking of that kind of thing."

Li Xian smiled, "Miss Nangong... I am an honest person, I really don't understand what you mean by 'that kind of thing'." Nangong Liuli rolled her eyes and said, "You... no one would believe you're honest!"

Li Xian said, "Does this count as holding a beauty in my arms?" Nangong Liuli sighed and said, "You snatched a beauty. My life is so bitter."

Li Xian said, "Why didn't you escape yourself back then." Nangong Liuli asked, "If I had escaped, wouldn't it be Sister Bian following you now? Would you prefer that?"

Li Xian said, "I wish you both had escaped. But now that you're in my hands, it seems fate is hard to defy." Nangong Liuli felt a bit grateful and said, "Then thank you for your kindness, good hero."

The journey was long. Walking on the mountain path, Nangong Liuli truly suffered unbearably. Her strength failed her, and she felt extremely tired after half a mile, sweating profusely.

Her beautiful eyes darted around. The dress restricted her acupoints all over her body, a very strange and indescribable feeling. Li Xian sensed something was wrong and asked, "What's wrong with you?"

Nangong Liuli rested for a moment and said with difficulty, "There are tiny needles hidden in this dress, piercing my skin. When I walk, stretch, or make any other small movement, it pulls the tiny needles. I... I can't go on, I need to rest."

Li Xian said, "I'll help you take it off later." Nangong Liuli shook her head, "It's not that simple... without a unique method, this dress cannot be taken off by force."

Li Xian said, "The Flower Cage Gate has many strange methods. Are you suffering a lot? Let me help you rest." Nangong Liuli nodded slightly. Li Xian held her waist and helped her to rest on a large rock by the roadside. Seeing that her forehead and the back of her neck were covered in sweat, and there were even fine bumps, she must be suffering extremely. When he touched her, Nangong Liuli trembled all over, and the bumps increased.

She smelled Li Xian's fresh scent, like sunlight shining on her. Her beautiful eyes immediately became unfocused and wavering, and she couldn't help but have some wild thoughts.

The Flowing Gaze of Rainbows dress contained a universe inside; it was not entirely for tormenting the wearer. The tiny needles pierced the body, soft and fine. They caused a slight itch, controlled physical strength and internal energy, and simultaneously increased primal desires.

Nangong Liuli had been bound by family rules since childhood and also protected by her family. The light of glory always shone on her, and she was always restrained. Now, in the dark and remote Flower Cage Gate, the light of her family could not shine here. She was naturally resentful and worried, but her desires were gradually increasing.

Nangong Liuli suddenly froze, scrutinizing Li Xian's face, and let out a deep "Hmm". She knew Li Xian was extremely handsome, young, and of humble origin, but she didn't know where he had learned so much. The light here was bright, and they were close, so she could see more clearly. She couldn't help but think: "This face... it's really a work of art. This young flower thief's handsome and unrestrained... is... is very rare."

Her pretty face turned slightly red.

Nangong Liuli sat for a while, her strength recovered slightly. Although there was still a tingling sensation all over, she could suppress it. She curiously asked, "Do you have a Reborn Physique?" Li Xian said, "Yes."

Nangong Liuli said, "Is it the Compassion Physique or the White Hair Physique?" Li Xian said, "I have the Perfect Physique."

Nangong Liuli was shocked: "Ah! You have such a talent?" Li Xian said, "Is this Reborn Physique very powerful?"

Nangong Liuli said, "Extremely powerful. Reborn Physiques are varied, like a scale... if you enjoy its benefits, a certain part will suffer its drawbacks."

"The Perfect Physique at every stage has only benefits and no drawbacks. Naturally, it is very powerful, but it ultimately depends on the person..."

Li Xian smiled, "I know. Hurry back, Instructor Nangong. With your beautiful looks, if others see you, they might block the road and try to snatch you."

Nangong Liuli spat lightly. Her strength recovered, Li Xian helped her up. When Nangong Liuli stood, she pulled the tiny needles and trembled again. Li Xian held her gently, preventing her from falling. They walked together, crossed a winding path, and passed through a stream. After walking for another half an hour, they saw a peach blossom town.

It was near evening. Smoke rose from the town's chimneys, peaceful and leisurely. Fields of flowers were everywhere. Farmers carrying hoes returned home, and naughty children played with bees. Nangong Liuli was very surprised and looked for a long time, not knowing there was such a town here.

Li Xian returned to the town and learned that Nangong Liuli had great difficulty walking and sitting. Fearing she would lose face, he returned to the inn first. The bedroom was on the second floor, but the stairs made Nangong Liuli cry out in pain.

Every step was restricted by the dress. The worst part was... she had suffered so much, but she didn't know if it was suffering or pleasure. If it was uncomfortable, it indeed made her feel depressed and helpless. If it was comfortable, the pulling of the tiny needles gave her a faint, surging feeling.

When they reached the second floor, her pretty face was as red as blood, and she leaned against the wall to rest. She cursed, "Damn it... who invented this dress? I'd rather be tied up."

Li Xian helped her into the room. They would stay at the inn for the night. Nangong Liuli's expression was strange. Seeing that the inn only had one bed, if Li Xian wanted to do that kind of thing, she would have no way to resist.

Li Xian took off her headdress. He weighed it lightly and thought: "This should be worth some money."

He said, "You'll sleep on the floor tonight."

Nangong Liuli said, "Me? On the floor?" Li Xian said, "The bed is too small, I need to sleep by myself."

Nangong Liuli was a little angry, but she could understand: "Alright... but I can't move, I'll have to trouble you to help me with that."

Li Xian said, "Of course."

He immediately called the innkeeper to bring another straw mat and a quilt. They were spread on the floor. The inn was small, and with the floor bedding, there was no space left. Li Xian washed his shoes and socks, sat cross-legged, practiced the Five Organs internally, moved the filth, and nourished his blood to strengthen his body.

[You moved the filth, Proficiency +1]

[Proficiency: 1533/1600 Mastery]

Accumulating daily, it was nearing minor accomplishment. Li Xian was full of ambition and steady in his actions. Nangong Liuli could not see clearly how Li Xian moved the filth to strengthen his organs, she just thought he was resting like this.

Midnight.

Nangong Liuli suddenly felt hungry. She tried to speak several times, but felt too embarrassed. Li Xian opened his eyes and looked at her, put on his shoes and socks, and went downstairs. After about an incense stick's time, he brought back local food.

The window was slightly open, and there was a jar of fragrant wine.

Nangong Liuli endured the pain of the tiny needles and sat at the table, eating and drinking. The stimulation from the needles gradually became accustomed to, but the itching and numbing in the acupoints on her soles were very difficult to adapt to.

She could only endure it.

After eating and drinking, her mind was slightly more at ease. Seeing that Nangong Liuli was so restricted and had no hope of escape, Li Xian also had no intention of leaving the island for the time being. Staying at the inn for a long time was inconvenient and not a long-term solution.

He decided to arrange for a "house" tomorrow.

The next morning.

Leaving Nangong Liuli in the bedroom, Li Xian walked through the streets, looking for an empty courtyard. The town was bustling with people from east to west and north to south, but there were surprisingly many vacant houses.

Many were empty. Li Xian inquired about several vacant properties, only to find they all had owners. They were the residences of several disciples who were away from the island seeking pleasure, so they were temporarily empty.

Passing a house in the east of the town, he saw a beautiful woman living inside, with an elegant and dignified demeanor, watering flowers and plants. Upon asking, he learned that this was the residence of an elder. The people living in the house were all his beautiful companions.

It turned out...

Beautiful companions were both a gift and a restriction. The Longevity Water Altar was secret, and the beautiful companions could never leave the altar. Those who possessed beautiful companions had to help them arrange a residence for them to live in for a long time.

Being constantly concerned, they would not forget to return. If a beautiful companion was favored by her "Master," her status was also quite good.

Li Xian thought to himself: "There are many intricacies here. I am new here and don't understand many things. I need to observe more, see more, and watch more in my actions."

Turning left and right in the alleyways. Li Xian observed the feng shui and chose a treasure house. However, the places with good feng shui all had owners. The deep courtyards and grand gardens, with exquisite landscapes, were difficult for Li Xian to rent or buy with his meager wealth.

He was not anxious, treating it as a leisurely walk. He came to "Green Ox Street" at the west entrance of the town and saw another abandoned house. The door was ajar, and the signboard had fallen off.

Such an old abandoned house definitely had no owner. In these chaotic times, the disciples of the Flower Cage Gate suffered heavy casualties. Today they might be glorious, but tomorrow they could be buried in a foreign land.

Li Xian pushed the door open and saw weeds everywhere.

The house was surprisingly large. The front yard was spacious, with several fruit trees that had not been pruned for a long time. They had borne fruit, which had ripened and fallen to the ground, rotting and accumulating, giving off a moldy smell.

The tree crowns were lush, growing wildly.

There was a winding stream for drinking games... but it had dried up and was overgrown with weeds half a man high. Pollen from the flower fields had blown into the yard, and strange flowers and weeds could be seen everywhere. Beside the plaque, seven or eight beehives hung, buzzing loudly, very noisy.

Abandoned for several years, many poisonous creatures had bred. Li Xian walked into the inner courtyard and saw a pavilion, a hall, four wing rooms, a main room, and a study...

The furniture had all decayed, covered with moss, and snake and rat nests were everywhere. Li Xian held his nose and looked around. Although the house had been abandoned for a long time, its layout and design were quite good.

The paths were all paved with bluestone slabs, but weeds grew wildly in the cracks. Li Xian wandered in the yard, occasionally hearing strange "rustling" sounds, which were the sounds of snakes and rats scurrying away.

There was a well and a clepsydra in the inner courtyard... going deeper, in the southwest corner of the yard, there was a secret room. After pushing the door open, there was a staircase leading down.

Walking down the stairs, he came to a dark cave. A cold and gloomy aura rushed towards him. Li Xian had a pure yang body, with vigorous yang fire, and was never afraid of ghosts or evil things. He drew the River-Sinking Sword and打出 two yang energy sword qi, igniting the wall candles.

The secret room was quite large... presumably used for seclusion and quiet cultivation. The ground was covered in dust, but no snakes, rats, or poisonous creatures were seen. It showed that the sealing was very good.

Going deeper, there was another layer of secret room inside the secret room. Li Xian lit the fire and saw that this layer of the secret room stored many miscellaneous tools. Ropes hung from the walls... and other objects.

Li Xian frowned slightly, and upon closer observation, he immediately understood. He revealed a mocking smile. It turned out this secret room was used for playing with beautiful companions.

There were strange and peculiar devices... truly an eye-opener. Li Xian thought: "They played quite elaborately, but unfortunately, these things are useless now that they've been empty for so long."

Although this abandoned house was very dirty and messy, with poisonous insects, snakes, and rats nesting in groups, Li Xian was short of a residence. If the price was suitable, renting or buying would be fine. So he went to the "Yamen Hall" of Peach Blossom Town.

Buying land and moving house, weddings and funerals, were all handled at the "Yamen Hall". Li Xian stated his intention, and the official of the Yamen Hall immediately took out the deed.

The Yamen Hall was not a governing institution of the Great Martial World. It was a folk yamen spontaneously organized by Peach Blossom Town and promoted by the Flower Cage Gate. Li Xian saw that the house was priced at 'Thirty-Six Taels', and couldn't help but speculate: "This Peach Blossom Town is isolated from the world, and materials are very cheap. In terms of food and clothing, it's hard to tell. But the land for the house... is not very expensive. The money I have left is almost enough to buy a house!"

He still had some silver left. By pawning Nangong Liuli's headdress, hairpins, and small anchors, he could buy the house. He couldn't help but feel secretly excited: "In my life, I have never truly bought a house or owned my own residence. Planting flowers and grass in the courtyard, practicing martial arts and going into seclusion..."

He decided to buy the house.

The official said, "Hero... do you really want to buy this house?"

Li Xian said, "What's wrong?" The official said, "I need to make it clear to you beforehand, so you won't come looking for me for trouble later. That house... is quite large, not remote nor bustling. It's a good place for a quiet residence."

"Previously, several heroes wanted to buy the house. But... that house is cold and gloomy, as if... as if haunted! Do you still want it?"

Li Xian frowned and said, "Then please show me all the other vacant houses. I'll decide then."

The official listed and displayed all the deeds in the town. Li Xian had already walked all over Peach Blossom Town, and upon seeing the text on the deeds, he knew which house it was. He was suddenly doused with cold water. Although land in Peach Blossom Town was cheap, a decent house covering several acres would cost hundreds of taels of silver.

It turned out...

That house had been abandoned for a long time, and the price had been reduced again and again. That's why it was so cheap. Li Xian pondered: "With this little silver... for a normal house, I couldn't even buy it, let alone rent it for long. Although that abandoned house is haunted, even a poor ghost is a ghost. If I really encounter a ghost, I'll invite it to drink tea and chat."

Li Xian said, "I'll buy that house anyway." The official did not persuade him further. Li Xian gathered enough silver, bought the deed, and returned to the inn with satisfaction, humming a little tune.

Nangong Liuli heard that they had "settled down" today, and felt a bit more at ease inexplicably. She said, "If we manage well, we can still live a good life." She then froze, as this sounded like a poor couple.

Li Xian said, "So I, Hua Wucuo... have settled down here. We'll stay at the inn for one more night. Tomorrow we'll go clean up the house."

Nangong Liuli said, "That's great... but I can't help you." Li Xian said, "In two days, it's Elder Liu Yu's banquet. He invited me. I'll ask him how to take off the Flowing Gaze of Rainbows dress."

Nangong Liuli said joyfully, "That's really thank you."

Li Xian suddenly smiled, "How will you repay me?" Nangong Liuli blushed, "You... how do you want me to repay you?"

Li Xian saw that although Nangong Liuli had been through many embarrassing things, she was a noble lady, as beautiful as the bright moon. He didn't think too much and顺势 smiled, "You're so beautiful."

Nangong Liuli was immediately at a loss, not knowing what Li Xian was up to. Li Xian teased, "Shall I hold you while you sleep?"

Nangong Liuli's heart pounded. She had never heard such straightforward words. She said, "Even if I don't want to, I... I can't refuse, can I?" Li Xian said, "It's a pity I'm not a flower thief, free and unrestrained. You'd better sleep on the floor."

Nangong Liuli felt a bit disappointed, with an indescribable anger. She thought: "If this young flower thief didn't have that intention, why did he say such annoying things?"

Li Xian said no more and closed his eyes to move the filth. Nangong Liuli, however, found it hard to fall asleep and couldn't help but have some wild thoughts. She knew she had fallen into the bandit's nest, and it would be hard to escape this calamity.

If it really came to that kind of thing, it would be her first time, and she was quite confused.
