# Chapter 266: Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Method

Xu Yunfan stood alone amidst a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. The head of his hammer dripped with demonic blood. After absorbing the blood energy, the dragon scale armor shimmered with dark golden patterns, clearly having undergone another enhancement.

Xu Yunfan didn't even frown at the pungent, fishy stench of the dense demonic blood.

He had long grown accustomed to the smell from hunting demons for food these past days. However, the concentration here was so overwhelming that it still made breathing somewhat difficult.

After selecting a few demonic corpses with the most potent blood energy, Xu Yunfan quickly distanced himself from the area.

Two hours later, Xu Yunfan was already seated cross-legged deep within a mountain cave. A flickering bonfire illuminated his cold, stern face.

Outside the cave, the mountain wind howled, but inside, spiritual energy was as dense as mist. It flowed slowly from the convergence point of the mountain's terrain, making this place an excellent spot for cultivation.

Xu Yunfan looked up at the wisps of spiritual mist drifting above and sighed inwardly. As time passed, the spiritual energy within this small realm seemed to be dwindling.

It was a cage...

Before him lay several demonic corpses brimming with blood energy. One of them had already been skinned and deboned, its flesh roasted over the bonfire. Fats dripped into the fire, producing a sizzling sound.

Although demonic flesh was foul-smelling and unpleasant, if handled properly, its taste could be quite good. Moreover, the vital blood energy it contained was a great tonic for martial artists.

He slowly turned the roasting meat, his gaze somewhat distant.

According to Yu Congling, this world was a cage-like realm where the Dao of Immortality did not exist. Only by breaking free from it could one have the chance to touch the path of cultivation.

This was what Yu Congling referred to as 'Position.'

He fished out the 'Primordial Order' from a hidden compartment within the mechanism box, rubbing the palm-sized token with his thumb.

Its texture was neither truly metal nor wood.

He prided himself on having handled many different types of metals and minerals in the Heavenly Work Cave, but he had never encountered a texture like this.

"Primordial, Primordial Demon..."

After a long while, after carefully putting the Primordial Order back into the hidden compartment, Xu Yunfan tore off a piece of roasted, charred meat. He chewed and swallowed it, feeling the surging blood energy within his body. He opened the mechanism box again, revealing the Ginseng Spirit. Ignoring its chattering, Xu Yunfan expressionlessly plucked a ginseng root from its wrist and put it in his mouth.

After pushing the Ginseng Spirit back in, he closed his eyes and focused his mind, beginning to comprehend the *Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Art* he had obtained from Jingming.

This cultivation method was one of the profound arts of the Maitreya Sect, and although it couldn't directly lead to the ninth realm of Qi Refining, it was still one of its ultimate techniques. It was specifically designed for martial artists in the Marrow Cleansing realm, emphasizing "changing tendons and bones, cleansing marrow and hair." It not only thoroughly tempered the bone marrow but also allowed the martial artist's physical body to be reborn, reaching the state of "Golden Marrow and Jade Bones." It could enhance a person's aptitude and alter their bone structure.

Feeling the intense ginseng energy rapidly spreading from his stomach to his four limbs and two hundred bones, Xu Yunfan recalled the incantation Jingming had described.

"Marrow is the essence of blood, bones are the house of marrow. Cleansing marrow is like refining gold, changing tendons is like forging a sword..."

He took a deep breath. The blood energy and strength within his body surged like a river, circulating according to the meridian paths of the *Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Art*.

Ordinary martial artists undergoing marrow cleansing must first use their internal strength to permeate the bones, then use blood energy to wash the bone marrow. The process is slow and painful.

But the *Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Art* is different. It emphasizes "using Qi to guide blood, using blood to temper marrow." It directly uses internal energy to guide blood energy deep into the bone marrow, its efficiency far exceeding ordinary marrow cleansing methods.

The pure Yang internal energy cultivated from the Pure Yang One Qi Technique was now proving its worth.

This *Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Art*, if one did not possess the refined pure Yang internal energy from the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, would require practicing its prerequisite martial arts and cultivating a mouthful of Vajra Qi to be feasible.

Xu Yunfan circulated the technique. Through his breathing, the spiritual energy of the realm was frantically devoured by him, transforming into pure internal energy. It traveled along the spine like a great dragon, climbing upwards and eventually converging within his bone marrow.

"Hisss..."

Intense pain struck!

His bone marrow felt as if it were being scorched by a raging fire, or pierced by thousands of steel needles. Veins bulged on Xu Yunfan's forehead, and cold sweat poured down him.

But he was already accustomed to pain. Not only did he not stop, but he also accelerated the circulation of his blood energy, forcing the impurities within his bone marrow to be expelled bit by bit.

After the marrow cleansing was complete—meaning the marrow inside his entire skeleton had been 'washed' once—the next step was the practice method of "Changing Tendons."

The two complemented each other. Missing any key practice method would disrupt the balance within the body, which, as Jingming had said, would cause an inexplicable戾气 (violent energy) to arise from within.

Most Buddhist martial arts follow a path of fierce and overwhelming power. Practicing them for a long time accumulates violent energy in the chest, which can easily lead to demonic deviation at the slightest provocation. That is why there are various Buddhist scriptures to cleanse the mind and resolve this violent energy.

The "Changing Tendons" method of the *Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Art* is extremely domineering. It requires using internal strength to forcibly stretch and compress the tendons throughout the body, increasing their resilience to the point where they can withstand even more explosive bursts of strength.

Xu Yunfan's arms trembled. His internal strength moved like dragons and snakes through his body, his tendons making a "cracking" sound, as if being pulled and reshaped by an invisible hand.

Faint golden patterns appeared on the surface of his skin, a sign that his tendons and bones had been tempered to the extreme.

By the time the tempering of his bone marrow and tendons was complete, three full hours had passed. Yet, Xu Yunfan still showed no signs of stopping.

The immense medicinal power from the ginseng root he had plucked from the Ginseng Spirit had not yet faded, continuously flowing within his body. If he didn't find a way to consume it, most of it would be wasted.

Xu Yunfan let out a low shout. The blood energy in his body boiled, and his internal strength seeped into his bones along with the blood energy. The depths of his bone marrow faintly shimmered with a golden luster, and his bones, washed by the spiritual energy, became as clear as jade.

[You are practicing the Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Art. With the assistance of the ginseng root and demonic vital energy, you seem to have begun to achieve success.]

[You are...]

The attribute panel in his vision continuously flickered with notifications of his training progress.

不知过了多久。

"It's done!"

His eyes snapped open, a sharp light like lightning flashing within them. The aura around his body surged. His bone marrow now flowed like mercury, his bones were as hard as divine iron, and his tendons were far more resilient than before.

[Your Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Art has reached Entry level.]

[Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Art 0/500 (Entry)]
[Special Effects: Golden Marrow Mercury Stage 1, Jade Bone Resonance, Tendon Changing Coiling Dragon.]

[...]

Looking at the information for the Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Refining Art displayed on the panel, Xu Yunfan slowly stretched his body. With his every movement, a series of crisp bone echoes could be heard from within his body.

The sound was not the dull friction of ordinary bones, but rather like two warm jades striking each other, sending clear, echoing ripples through the silent cave.

The massive, python-like warm currents that had spontaneously risen within his body had yet to subside, continuously strengthening his physique.

He clenched his five fingers into a fist, and his knuckles actually emitted a layer of lustrous jade light.

As his muscles tensed, his great sinews coiled like pythons, revealing winding patterns beneath his skin.

Xu Yunfan stretched his five fingers, then clenched them tightly with a forceful grip!

*Boom!*

With a muffled sound, a visible, turbid white shockwave was generated from his fist.

It was an air blast.

He hadn't even used his full force. After reaching the Entry level in this martial art, his own strength had taken a great step forward.

The most astonishing change came from the depths of his bone marrow.

Xu Yunfan could clearly perceive that there seemed to be a liquid metal flowing within his great dragon spine. With every heartbeat, it pushed the Golden Marrow Mercury to circulate between his bones.

He casually sliced his own arm. The blood droplets that seeped from the wound carried a faint golden glow. In just three breaths, the flesh had already healed as if it were new.
