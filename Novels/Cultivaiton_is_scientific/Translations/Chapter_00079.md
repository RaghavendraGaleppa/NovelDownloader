# Chapter 79: Refining the Corpse

After spending some time studying the "Profound Nether Corpse Refining Manual," Li Shiming was no longer an outsider when it came to refining corpses.

First of all, refined corpses could be stolen. As long as the original owner of the corpse was dead and the corpse remained inside the Corpse Storage Bag, one could use special methods to claim the corpse for themselves. Moreover, the strength of the stolen corpse wouldn't diminish at all and could even be further enhanced.

This perfectly aligned with the characteristics of the Profound Nether Sect—seizing resources for personal use. Since refined corpses were essentially products of accumulated resources, they could naturally be taken as well.

However, under normal circumstances, a cultivator with a refined corpse could easily overpower others of the same rank, making theft quite difficult. Not to mention, the refined corpse had to be inside the Corpse Storage Bag when its owner was killed.

Most of the time, before a Profound Nether Sect cultivator died, they would either make their refined corpse self-destruct or drive it into complete madness, rendering it impossible to refine again.

That Li Shiming managed to obtain a Corpse Storage Bag was due to sheer luck—and the misfortune of the Profound Nether Sect cultivator in Zhongdu City.

That cultivator had snatched a single-spiritual-root seedling from within the Profound Nether Sect's territory and refined it into a corpse. Afterward, the sect discovered this and, to enforce discipline—and more importantly, because the cultivator lacked a powerful backer—he was hunted down.

The cultivator fled, secretly killing people along the way to gather blood for refining his corpse. Eventually, he arrived in the Heavenly Sea Sect's domain and discovered that the secular cities there were filled with rogue cultivators at the Qi Refining stage.

It was like hitting the jackpot. These rogue cultivators had no defensive formations in the city and were weak—perfect resources for refining corpses. During his time in Zhongdu City, he even became pickier with ordinary people, only targeting those born during the Yin hours for blood extraction.

The rogue cultivators being used for refining corpses was partly Li Shiming's fault. If he hadn't wiped out the Hao Family, the rogue cultivators wouldn't have gathered in Zhongdu City, and the Profound Nether Sect cultivator wouldn't have targeted them.

If the Profound Nether Sect cultivator hadn't attacked rogue cultivators in Zhongdu City, Gu Jia—the Heavenly Sea Sect's stationed cultivator—wouldn't have cared about their deaths. 

Everything seemed predestined. The destruction of the Hao Family outside the city made Gu Jia suspect the presence of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Combined with the incident involving the Profound Nether Sect cultivator, he reported it to the sect, which led to Elder Cui's arrival.

When the Profound Nether Sect cultivator faced Elder Cui's flying sword, the overwhelming pressure of a Foundation Establishment cultivator left him no chance—nor the will—to summon his refined corpse.

A Bronze Corpse would be nothing more than a single slash of sword light to a Foundation Establishment cultivator. When Elder Cui's sword light shattered the fleeing Profound Nether Sect cultivator's body, the Corpse Storage Bag fell with the remains, allowing Li Shiming to pick it up later.

Li Shiming repeatedly memorized the sigils for subduing a refined corpse. Faced with the temptation of a Bronze Corpse, how could he resist?

Based on the situation in Zhongdu City, this Bronze Corpse had at least mid-stage Qi Refining strength. Currently at only the third layer of Qi Refining, Li Shiming had no idea how long it would take to reach the fourth layer and enter the mid-stage. Subduing the Bronze Corpse would instantly boost his combat power significantly.

If he hadn't encountered the Profound Nether Sect's attack, he might have hesitated—after all, this was the Profound Nether Sect's corpse-refining technique. But after experiencing the brink of death, he knew personal strength was paramount. He didn't want to leave his fate to luck again.

He took out the Corpse Storage Bag, drew the Blazing Flame Sword, and made a small cut on his fingertip. Then, he channeled his spiritual energy to force out a drop of vital blood.

As the drop of vital blood left his body, it emitted waves of spiritual energy. Li Shiming felt extremely weak—extracting vital blood according to the "Profound Nether Self-Refining Manual" had far worse consequences than he expected.

If not for the days spent cultivating the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique" on the flying boat, forcing out this drop of vital blood at the third layer of Qi Refining might have dropped him back to the second layer.

"I should've known the Profound Nether Sect's methods would be strange!" he muttered helplessly.

But there was no turning back now.

Under his control, the drop of vital blood, connected to his spirit, transformed into a complex sigil. He sent the sigil into the Corpse Storage Bag, guiding it toward the Bronze Corpse's forehead.

The moment the sigil touched the corpse's forehead, its eyes snapped open, flashing with a violent struggle. If the corpse hadn't been immobilized inside the bag, its frenzy wouldn't have been limited to its eyes.

Li Shiming's mind buzzed. His vision blurred, and countless blood-soaked figures appeared—men and women, old and young—floating inches above the ground as they swayed toward him. Their shrill screams, agonized wails, and eerie whispers sent chills through his soul.

Already weakened from extracting the vital blood, Li Shiming collapsed to the ground.

*"Detected 8Hz low-frequency sound waves..."*  
*"Detected 219dB lethal sound waves..."*  

IBMz15 flooded his vision with urgent warnings. His senses were linked to the supercomputer, which he had programmed to alert him to danger.

"Play 'Great Compassion Mantra'!" he commanded, clinging to the last shreds of clarity.

The chanting of the mantra filled his senses, immersing his mind and body in the purifying verses of Buddhist scripture. The terrifying influence transmitted through the sigil from the Bronze Corpse could no longer affect him.

"I knew it, I knew it!" Li Shiming muttered in frustration once his emotions stabilized.

During the blood extraction, he had suspected the Profound Nether Sect's techniques would have severe side effects. But greed had clouded his judgment—owning a Bronze Corpse at the early Qi Refining stage, regardless of whether it had mid- or late-stage strength, was too tempting. With the materials he had, he could even nurture it to peak Bronze Corpse level.

More importantly, following the "Profound Nether Corpse Refining Manual," he only needed three more materials to potentially elevate the Bronze Corpse to an Iron Corpse—a Foundation Establishment-level combatant.

Just look at how Jiang Bingneng of the Profound Nether Sect had held his own against two opponents and escaped even after Elder Cui joined the fight—all thanks to his Iron Corpse.

Greed had made him reckless, causing him to lose his usual caution.

"But it was worth it!" Li Shiming laughed heartily as he sprawled on the ground, sensing the connection with the Bronze Corpse. He had succeeded—the Bronze Corpse was now his.
