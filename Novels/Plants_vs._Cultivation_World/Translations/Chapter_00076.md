# Chapter 76: Fragrance Fills the Room  

After entering the small house, Gu Mo sealed the doors and windows, then activated the protective formations to prevent the fragrance from Chu Feifei's special constitution from leaking out and causing unnecessary trouble.  

With the house completely sealed, darkness enveloped the interior, broken only by the faint glow of a spirit lamp. At this moment, Chu Feifei's heartbeat inexplicably quickened.  

"Are you ready?"  

After ensuring everything was secure, Gu Mo asked Chu Feifei. Next, he would search for the optimal spiritual frequency for her body. In the process, all the secrets of her physique would be exposed to his senses.  

"Mm!"  

Chu Feifei nodded.  

Seeing her agreement, Gu Mo took her slender hand, sending pulsating spiritual energy through her palm to explore her body.  

"Absolutely genuine."  

If Yuan Niya had any artificial enhancements, Chu Feifei was the real deal—her ample curves were all-natural.  

However, noticing Chu Feifei's slight fidgeting, Gu Mo quickly composed himself and continued channeling his spiritual energy downward.  

Suddenly, Chu Feifei stiffened as if startled, her legs snapping together as a blush spread across her face.  

Compared to Yuan Niya, Chu Feifei's reaction seemed more intense. To avoid awkwardness, Gu Mo closed his eyes, pretending to focus intently on adjusting the spiritual frequency for her, feigning ignorance.  

Seeing Gu Mo's oblivious expression, Chu Feifei let out a silent sigh of relief. If he had noticed what just happened, she would have died of embarrassment.  

As the pulsating spiritual energy continued its course, Chu Feifei gradually relaxed.  

Once the energy had circulated through her body, Gu Mo slowly opened his eyes and confirmed again, "Are you sure you want to receive a perfected-level Cleansing Technique?"  

He wasn't certain what effects the perfected-level technique would have on her, and unforeseen circumstances couldn't be ruled out.  

"Yes. If anything unexpected happens, I take full responsibility," Chu Feifei replied earnestly.  

"Alright!"  

Seeing her determination, Gu Mo didn't hesitate. With a flick of his hand, he cast the perfected-level Cleansing Technique on her.  

In the next instant, it was as if a piece of jade buried in dust had been cleansed of impurities, revealing its dazzling brilliance.  

An intense fragrance erupted from Chu Feifei's body. With just one whiff, Gu Mo felt as though he had drunk himself into a stupor.  

Instinctively, he activated the Wine God Soul-Tempering Technique. To his astonishment, the technique began operating smoothly without any spiritual wine—and the effect was even stronger than when he used wine.  

Meanwhile, Chu Feifei was equally shocked. She could feel spiritual energy surging toward her from all directions. With just a slight effort, she could effortlessly absorb it, her cultivation speed skyrocketing beyond belief.  

Without hesitation, she began cultivating, seizing this rare opportunity. Thus, within the fragrant confines of the small house, Gu Mo and Chu Feifei immersed themselves in cultivation.  

An hour later, the fragrance around Chu Feifei gradually faded, like jade being covered in dust once more. However, this time, a permanent change had occurred—a small patch of the dust had been permanently wiped away, leaving a glimmer of light.  

This meant the perfected-level Cleansing Technique had permanently activated a fraction of Chu Feifei's special constitution. With repeated sessions, she could eventually undergo a complete transformation.  

Feeling the changes in her body, Chu Feifei's eyes sparkled with joy. If she could maintain such terrifying cultivation speed, she believed she could reach the peak of Qi Refining within a few years.  

"Gu Mo, thank you!"  

She bowed solemnly to him. The perfected-level Cleansing Technique was nothing short of a rebirth for her.  

"No need for thanks. The fragrance from your body greatly benefits my cultivation as well," Gu Mo replied, inwardly thrilled by the rapid growth of his spiritual sense.  

"Then... can I come to you again?" Chu Feifei asked hopefully. A single session wasn't enough to fully awaken her constitution—she needed Gu Mo's continued assistance.  

"Of course."  

Gu Mo had no reason to refuse. The fragrance she emitted accelerated his Wine God Soul-Tempering Technique. A few more sessions, and he might even develop divine sense—a power typically reserved for Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

"However, you'll need to conceal your fragrance." Gu Mo leaned in and sniffed. Though the intense aroma had faded, a faint scent still lingered around her. As her constitution continued awakening, the fragrance would grow stronger.  

"I'll find a way to mask it before coming to you again," Chu Feifei said, understanding the need for discretion. As a mere outer disciple, drawing too much attention would be unwise.  

"I have a technique for concealing auras. You can try it." Gu Mo thought of the Breath-Concealing Art he had learned from the rogue cultivator. Since it wasn't a sect technique, he could freely teach it to her.  

Taking the manual from Gu Mo, Chu Feifei studied him curiously. If he had mastered this technique, his current Qi Refining second-layer cultivation might not be his true level.  

"Am I that fascinating?" Gu Mo asked flatly. He had anticipated her suspicion, but he no longer feared exposure. With the sect leader's reward of spiritual pills, rapid progress was only natural.  

"Not at all. I'll take my leave."  

Chu Feifei smiled, pleased to have uncovered another of Gu Mo's secrets. Now that they each knew something private about the other, they were even.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo!"  

Not long after Chu Feifei left, Yuan Niya arrived.  

"Senior Sister, you seem delighted. Did something good happen?" Gu Mo asked, noting her cheerful expression.  

"Hehe!"  

Yuan Niya grinned, then released the spiritual aura of a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator.  

Sensing her energy, Gu Mo's eyes widened in surprise. Last time, she had mentioned going into seclusion—now she had broken through to the fourth layer of Qi Refining.  

*Truly worthy of a mid-grade fire spiritual root. Her speed is astonishing.*
