Chapter 204: That Has to Be Me, the Day the Hidden Dragon List is Announced!

“Someone actually left such a mark on the Stone of Strange Sword Scars. It’s simply too much!”

Wei Zhaoliu clenched her fists, trembling with anger.

Li Mo coughed lightly.

“Actually, is it possible that he didn’t want to do it either?”

“He just happened to gain some enlightenment while looking at it, and happened to leave that enlightenment behind.”

Wei Zhaoliu’s expression froze upon hearing this. She opened her mouth, then pressed her lips together and lowered her head.

She had been contemplating the strange stone since she was a child, yet she couldn’t leave even a scratch on it.

But that person, on his very first attempt, had reshaped the stone to his will.

The gap between them was simply despairing.

For a moment, Wei Zhaoliu’s eyes lost focus. That sword mark was like the will of heaven; how could it be so easily...

“Ahem.”

Seeing that she was on the verge of a mental breakdown again, Li Mo said seriously, “Wei Shijie, your talent in the Dao of the Sword is astonishing. One day, you will surely comprehend an even more powerful sword art. Won’t you be able to change the stone back then?”

The comfort from his soul intent, combined with his gentle words, had a remarkable effect.

“Yes, I just need to work a little harder...”

Wei Zhaoliu nodded heavily. “Thank you for the wake-up call, Shidi! If you have any questions about the Dao of the Sword that you don’t understand, feel free to ask me!”

“Helping others is the root of happiness. There’s no need for thanks.”

Li Mo blinked calmly.

Wei Zhaoliu sighed.

“That person is simply a monster.”

“In what aspect?”

“In every aspect. His talent goes without saying, but who in their right mind practices with a hammer?”

Wei Zhaoliu said indignantly.

“...”

Li Mo was silent for a few seconds, feeling quite sympathetic. “If one had a choice, who would want to... Actually, people who practice with hammers aren’t necessarily bad people.”

Wei Zhaoliu frowned. “Shidi, why are you empathizing with that person? Are you very familiar with him?”

“To be honest, he and I are sworn enemies.”

“That makes sense. You definitely don’t have that kind of aura.”

Wei Zhaoliu nodded.

When she thought of someone who practiced with a hammer, she automatically imagined a figure with a tiger’s back and a bear’s waist, fierce and savage, capable of eating three children in one meal.

This Shidi was handsome and gentle; he didn’t look like the type who would get along with such a person at all.

Besides, he had just helped her.

What a nice guy.

.......

After coming down from the Sword Pavilion, he did not return to Yunzhou City.

Today, the Ice Cube was giving a lecture at the Sword Pond.

The so-called Sword Pond was the place where Hengyun Sword City stored its swords, similar to the Divine Blade Cave. It was a massive open-air plaza.

In the center was a clear pool of water, inside which all kinds of swords were stored.

At this moment, the Sword Pond was packed with people, surrounded three layers deep.

“No wonder Yi Bing could become this session’s Sword Hero. What she says is even better than what my External Scene Master teaches.”

“If only she were a disciple of the Sword City.”

“If she were a Sword City disciple, it wouldn’t be long before the Eldest Shijie would have to change.”

“It’s a pity we couldn’t hear Young Master Li’s lecture. He also has the potential of a Sword Immortal; I wonder what unique understanding he would have of the Sword Dao.”

.......

While listening attentively, low murmurs of discussion could be heard from time to time.

Seeing that there were too many people and the lecture was almost over, Li Mo decided not to go in.

He stood there for a while.

Suddenly, he was lost in thought.

Not far away, a small figure with a basket on her back was poking the ground with a peach blossom branch.

With a light flick, a fragment of a broken sword was lifted up and flew into her small basket.

The air was humid, and strands of hair stuck to her neck, but she was engrossed in her task.

“Chu Long, why aren’t you going into the Sword Pond?”

Looking at the faint dimples at the corners of her mouth, Li Mo walked over and asked.

“I’ve... I’ve already listened.”

“You’ve already listened?”

“Sister Bing’s lecture... is very similar to Teacher’s...”

“...”

“Could it be that Sister Bing... was also... also guided by Teacher?”

Jiang Chulong tilted her head, looking a bit confused.

“That’s not necessarily true. After all, the principles of the Sword Dao lead to the same end. Perhaps they just have similar understandings.”

“Hmm... that makes sense.”

Princess Jiang felt that what Li-ge said was very reasonable.

---

Watching her accurately lift another broken sword from the earth, Li Mo asked curiously, “Chu Long, how do you know there are swords buried in the ground?”

“Because... I can hear them... and... and there are so many of them.”

Since there was nothing else to do, Li Mo accompanied Princess Jiang in the愉快 task of picking up trash near the Sword Pond.

If you ignored the fact that what they were picking up were all broken sword fragments, it was a bit like a spring outing, digging for wild vegetables and gathering mushrooms...

Before long, the small basket was almost full.

“Why are they all swords...”

“It’s strange.”

Li Mo noticed that all the swords buried in the nearby earth were damaged?

And they were buried quite neatly.

“Of course it’s strange.”

A familiar voice came. It could be heard that he was suppressing some kind of emotion.

“Hmm?”

Li Mo looked up and saw Elder Zeng standing there with a dark face, looking at the two of them displeased.

“These swords have been buried around the Sword Pond for a long time.”

“I didn’t expect them to be dug up by you two.”

“A long time?”

Li Mo’s heart stirred. If they had been buried for so long without being discovered by others, didn’t that mean these swords were all extraordinary?

If it weren’t for Princess Jiang’s Innate Sword Body, she probably wouldn’t have been able to find them.

Could it be that they were treasures deliberately placed to test the disciples’ talent?

Elder Zeng’s face darkened even more.

“Yes! I set up a sword-nurturing formation around the Sword Pond according to the strange门 directions. Now, it’s all been dug up by you two!”

Li Mo: “...”

He was just about to tell Princess Jiang that these swords weren’t discarded trash and needed to be put back, when he saw Jiang Chulong with her head drooped, looking pitiful, the small basket weighing down her thin shoulders, heavier than she was.

She said in a small voice, “But... but these swords... are crying...”

“Ahem... Elder Zeng.”

“Hmm?”

“Could your sect consider another method to nurture swords?”

“Compared to using damaged swords, other methods cost even more! Who will pay for it? You?”

“It has to be me.”

.....

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in a Golden Stone Sword-Containing Great Array.】

【Investment Feedback: 100 Years of Martial Arts Comprehension.】

Trading money for Martial Arts Comprehension was an incredibly good deal.

Little Li just happened to need a massive amount of Martial Arts Comprehension.

He still needed to condense four Profound Pills.

That is to say, he still needed to cultivate four types of Heart Methods, advance them to the Profound Pill Realm, and turn them into stars in the *Scripture of the Heavenly Stars and Profound Pill*.

Now, no amount of Martial Arts Comprehension was too much for him.

Thus, Elder Zeng made the Sword Pond’s spiritual energy a bit stronger, Little Jiang got her hard-to-find trash, and Li Mo gained Martial Arts Comprehension.

A win-win for all three!

....

Three days later.

The elders who were already on the way had not yet arrived.

However, the new issue of the Hidden Dragon List was about to be published.

Little Li didn’t sleep last night; instead, he deduced the *Eight Treasures Devouring Gold Art* and practiced all night.

With various rare treasures and the fact that he had already walked the path to the Profound Pill Realm once, the process went very smoothly.

But he was still a bit short of condensing another Profound Pill.

“If this continues, it will probably take two months to gather the Seven Stars...”

Not long after, the disciples of Qingyuan Sect had all gathered.

“The elders should be arriving soon. I wonder if we’ll be in time to see the list as soon as it’s published.”

Shen Yunfei smiled. “Let’s set off!”

Qingyuan Sect rarely has disciples on the list.

But this time, there were two who were certain to be on it; it was just a matter of how high their rankings would be.

Thinking this, he looked towards a distance.

There, the young man and young woman had just walked out of the courtyard together.

A small girl with cloth strips covering her eyes followed behind them.

Shen Yunfei had a momentary illusion.

In just a few days, their aura... had grown stronger?
