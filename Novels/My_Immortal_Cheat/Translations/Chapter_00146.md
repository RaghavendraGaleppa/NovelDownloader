## Chapter 146: Art of Military Formations

"Sacred? A mere homeless cur dares to represent the Sacred!"

Zhou Changsheng showed no mercy, tearing away their facade.

"You are far inferior to those ancient heroes of the Fuxi Realm. It seems you are indeed feeling apprehensive, debating with me here. Otherwise, you would have long since attacked."

The Holy Lord was not disturbed by Zhou Changsheng's words. He saw clearly that they were indeed uncertain, fearing that Kyushu would catch them off guard. But for now, their external arrangements had proven effective.

Zhou Changsheng's face sank. These old monsters had lived for countless years, capable of discerning much from the slightest clue.

"Those ancient predecessors were naturally peerless, but our generation is not ordinary either. They could shatter your world, and so can we!" Zhou Changsheng roared, his voice like rolling thunder. He naturally respected the ancient sages, but he also had his own pride, confident he was no weaker than anyone.

"Junior, mind your words!"

As this voice spoke, actual thunder appeared, thick as a dragon, rumbling in the void.

This was the Thunder God Lord. He possessed the body of a burly man, clad in armor that covered only parts of his physique, revealing incredibly muscular skin with purple material tattooed into lightning patterns.

Deities are very special life forms, with no true lifespan limits. As long as someone believes in them and praises them in their hearts, they can exist. But similarly, if they lose faith, they will die directly.

These ancient deities, with their long-standing and powerful divine positions, were hard to kill. They acted like old-timers, calling Zhou Changsheng a "junior."

Zhou Changsheng sneered, his face full of disdain.

"It's a disgrace for you, Thunder God Lord, to wield the most unyielding and strongest power, yet be the first to flee when your homeland was shattered! What right do you have to control the Thunder Divine Seat anymore!"

"This is why I planned for so long!"

The Dao hearts of these deities were as firm as world barriers; they would not be swayed by Zhou Changsheng's mere words.

"No more talk, let's fight. Let me see what abilities this so-called Kyushu truly possesses!"

A hoarse, bone-grinding sound came from a mass of black mist beside the Thunder God Lord. This was Death, an incredibly powerful divine position, surpassing elemental deities.

Zhou Changsheng's gaze subtly swept over the four deities who had remained silent. Although their status was inferior to the Holy Lord, Thunder, and Death, their physical strength was that of true Heavenly Kings, making them very troublesome.

Boom!

As if chaos was being recreated, a massive explosion drew everyone's attention.

The huge bronze ancient doors of the Pantheon slowly opened, emitting myriad auspicious lights and divine sounds echoing in the void. Finally, a crack appeared. But because the bronze doors were already immensely huge, even a mere crack was large enough for a hundred people to enter simultaneously.

Zhou Tian's eyes held some doubt. Was this Pantheon related to the Heavenly Mandate? He had thought the opening of the Pantheon signaled the Heavenly Mandate's appearance, and the Holy Devil's vigil here confirmed his idea. But seeing the Pantheon stop after opening just a crack, it was clearly not the grand unveiling for the Heavenly Mandate.

"Sky-Resounding Dragon Horn!" Zhou Changsheng roared.

"Woo-" A deep, muffled horn sounded, interrupting Zhou Tian's thoughts.

The horn's rolling sound, like muffled thunder, echoed throughout the Boundless Heavens.

This horn was refined from a Sky Dragon's horn, enhanced by countless formations. This horn had long become spiritual, unimaginable, a rare treasure for military formations.

A true dragon's horn was already a rare treasure in the world, and its power when made into a horn could be imagined. However, at this moment, the horn's sound did not harm souls. Although it resonated through heaven and earth, it did not cause blood qi to churn or pose a risk of explosion.

The moment the horn sounded, many people became solemn. Among the younger generation, some felt a sense of desolate grandeur and surging passion, wishing to immediately throw themselves into battle. Even Zhou Tian felt a surge of hot blood, wishing to rush out and fight immediately.

A fissure opened at the bottom of the Ancient Qin Ship, and the black armored soldiers leaped down, landing on the ground.

"Hoo!"

Almost instantly, a military formation was assembled. Roaring, towering blood qi shot into the sky, like a sea of blood floating in the air. Blood clouds churned, sounds of battle emerged from within, and the firmament shattered.

The Sky Dragon Horn, refined from a true dragon's horn, had a sound that moved through eternity, capable of greatly increasing courage and battle intent. Otherwise, no matter how profound the art of military formations, if individual disparity was too great—like the difference between an ant and a true dragon, where a single glance could kill—how could one speak of resistance?

The other seven major forces also employed similar methods. In the blink of an eye, eight military formations were formed. Their qi and blood surged like wolf smoke collapsing clouds, flames burned fiercely, divine light flowed abundantly, and killing intent soared to the heavens. Each formation seemed connected, their energies merging.

"Thrust!"

A great shout came from the Heavenly Qin military formation. This was the army's commander, also the core of the formation, giving orders from the center.

"Hoo!"

Ten thousand men moved as one, each performing the same action, thrusting forward, their sound shaking eternity!

A colossal blood-colored spear, ten thousand zhang long, shot out from the surging blood clouds. Its blood light was dazzling, and faint, tragic cries could be heard—these were once great enemies of this army, now turned into spirits fallen beneath the spear.

Boom!

A vertical eye split open on the Thunder God Lord's brow, emitting dazzling blue light, as if a thunder world existed within it.

A blue lightning bolt shot out from it, initially thumb-thick, but as it neared the blood spear, it transformed into a vivid thunder dragon, its scales flashing with electricity.

The void exploded, chaos churned, and both the thunder dragon and the blood spear vanished simultaneously. The Thunder God Lord, however, frowned slightly, somewhat surprised.

Although the previous attack was not his full power, its might was considerable, and he hadn't expected it to be nullified.

"The Fuxi Realm's art of military formations was renowned in ancient times; there's no need to be surprised." The Holy Lord spoke, extending a luminous jade hand. Melodious chanting echoed, and behind her, an ancient mountain seemed to appear, its height unknown, countless holy spirits with double wings circling it. A light gate opened in the void outside.

Figures shrouded in white light stepped out, with ethereal wings on their backs. These were her Divine Kingdom Holy Spirits, who could be summoned to descend by some method connecting to the Divine Kingdom.

The opponents had the aid of military formations. If they had no counter-method, it would be very troublesome for them.

The Thunder God Lord was likewise. Behind him, a thunder world floated and sank, and from the thunder emerged beings purely composed of lightning. From afar, they didn't look like soldiers but like a sea of lightning.

From the turbid river flowing around the God of Death, skeleton soldiers and Nightmare Knights crawled out. Although they seemed to walk shakily, as if they would shatter at a touch, they were actually anything but fragile. As their numbers grew, a mass of black mist condensed above their heads, and these skeletons even knew the art of military formations.
