# Chapter 1: The Nightmare

"Whew! Whew! Whew!"

In the darkness, Qin Ziling abruptly sat up from his wooden bed, his chest heaving violently, his forehead drenched in beads of cold sweat.

He had just had that nightmare again.

In the dream, he saw himself sitting in a wheelchair, looking up at a plane flying closer through the blue sky, its roaring engines tearing through the air, trailing two long white vapor streams behind it.

Suddenly, the plane transformed into a monstrous bird with a dragon's head—its massive fleshy wings covered in golden scales, two gleaming fangs sharp as blades, and hollow eyes with eerie flames flickering within, appearing utterly terrifying.

On the back of this monstrous bird crouched a tall, thin, elderly man dressed in black, his face aged and hideous, clearly injured.

The two long white vapor trails behind the plane morphed into two enormous swords, their edges gleaming with deadly sharpness.

In the dream, he suddenly became that elderly, ugly, injured man, lying weakly on the cold, sinister-feeling monstrous bird, filled with despair as the giant swords came hurtling toward him.

In an instant, the two swords erupted with a blinding, sun-like radiance, countless sword beams roaring forth, filling the sky.

"My life ends here!" The injured man in the dream—Qin Ziling—felt an indescribable pain. Then he saw his body, along with the monstrous bird beneath him, pierced through by countless sword beams, riddled with holes before exploding violently.

The terrifying shockwave from the explosion caused several nearby mountain peaks to collapse.

Blood, flesh, and shattered rocks flew in all directions.

The dream's final image froze on a severed finger streaking through the night sky, falling into an ancient well behind a dilapidated Taoist temple at the mountain's base.

A black ring was wrapped around the severed finger.

Above the temple's entrance hung a weathered plaque, tilted to one side, bearing the words: "Chixiao Temple."

...

After a long while, Qin Ziling gradually calmed down in the darkness. He glanced at the paper-covered wooden window—still pitch black outside—before lying back down. Staring at the wooden beams overhead, covered in thick cobwebs, his eyes reflected complex emotions and confusion.

Ten days ago, he had still been lying in a hospital room with bright glass windows and white-painted ceilings.

That day, his consciousness had gradually grown distant and hazy, enveloped by an immense darkness that sought to devour him. At that moment, he thought he had finally lost to his illness, that his life was about to end.

But he truly couldn't accept it.

He had just turned thirty. Three years prior, after countless setbacks, his career had finally begun to flourish, and a bright future seemed within reach.

So he fought back fiercely, constantly telling himself to hold on. He struggled desperately in the darkness, refusing to let his consciousness fade.

He believed modern medicine was advancing rapidly—as long as he persevered, there was hope!

Finally, the darkness that sought to consume him dissipated, and he lost consciousness.

When he awoke, he found himself lying in this old, dilapidated wooden house, covered by a tattered quilt, having become a nineteen-year-old youth named Qin Ziling.

Ten days wasn't particularly long, but because he had not only taken over Qin Ziling's body but also inherited his memories, he had gradually begun to accept and adapt to his new identity after days of confusion.

Yet the recurring nightmare over these ten days, along with the frequent flashes of grotesque zombie-like figures in his mind—even the occasional sudden emergence of evil, ruthless thoughts from his subconscious—left him, the soul now inhabiting Qin Ziling's body, feeling an eerie, bone-chilling terror upon reflection.

It was as if his soul harbored another, far darker, more sinister and merciless consciousness.

"If I've truly crossed over into Qin Ziling's body like in the novels, why do I keep dreaming of becoming that ugly, even sinister old man? Why does my mind, aside from my own memories and Qin Ziling's past, keep flashing fragmented, chaotic, dark, and evil images—even scenes with bizarre zombies? These definitely aren't Qin Ziling's memories! Could it be from watching too many horror and zombie movies in my past life?"

"But this time, in the nightmare, I actually saw the temple's name clearly. In previous dreams, the temple's name never appeared."

Lost in these thoughts, Qin Ziling drifted back into a fitful sleep.

When he woke again, dawn was breaking.

Qin Ziling's home was a three-section courtyard house. The brick-and-tile east and west wings, the three main rooms with four side chambers, the winding corridors, and the decorative screen wall—all spoke of the Qin family's former prosperity.

But now, the tilting structures and peeling red-painted mud walls revealed their current decline.

The once meticulously laid cross-shaped brick pathways and carefully designed courtyard had become vegetable plots and a poultry pen, the ground littered with chicken and duck droppings.

Qin Ziling lived in the east wing. When he stepped out, a young woman in a coarse linen dress was feeding the poultry. She had delicate, refined features and a graceful figure, though her sallow skin and malnourished appearance were evident.

"Young Master, you're awake. Let me fetch water for you to wash up," Yin Ranyue said quickly upon seeing Qin Ziling emerge.

"No need, I'll do it myself," Qin Ziling waved her off and strode to the well to draw water for washing.

Watching him do this himself, Yin Ranyue looked puzzled.

She was a pitiful orphan, once nearly starved to death by the roadside until Qin's mother took her in out of compassion.

At that time, the Qin family hadn't yet fallen into decline. They owned fertile farmland outside the city, shops within, and had several servants, maids, and tenant farmers.

But their fortunes soon changed. First, their shop burned down, reducing all goods to ashes. Then the family patriarch passed away, followed by Qin Ziling's father falling gravely ill. To pay for treatment, the family sold off their farmland and livestock, and the servants gradually left.

Only Yin Ranyue remained. She had been just ten then—clever and obedient—and Qin's mother, fond of her and pitying her plight, kept her.

Eventually, Qin Ziling's father succumbed to his illness, leaving the family in deepening poverty.

Having grown up as the young master, Qin Ziling had always taken Yin Ranyue's service for granted, often scolding her when in a foul mood.

But since falling severely ill ten days ago, Yin Ranyue noticed Qin Ziling had shed his young master's airs, even speaking to her gently.

"Could the young master be thinking of... marital matters?" Yin Ranyue's malnourished face flushed slightly at the thought, and she hurried to the kitchen to bring out the prepared breakfast to the main hall's wooden table.

Having served Qin Ziling since childhood, in wealthier households, she would have been considered a "bedchamber maid"—destined to remain with the family, not to be married off. Given the Qin family's current state, a grand wedding for Qin Ziling was unlikely. More probable was her transition from maid to daughter-in-law, saving the cost of a bride price.

Thus, in her heart, Yin Ranyue had long considered herself Qin Ziling's woman—the only question was whether she'd be wife or concubine.

Now, with Qin Ziling's modern sensibilities leading him to treat her with natural consideration and respect, Yin Ranyue felt both surprised and delighted, her imagination running wild.

As Yin Ranyue went to fetch breakfast, Qin Ziling entered the inner room, where his mother, Madam Cui, was already weaving.

Madam Cui was renowned in the village for her weaving skills, her cloth highly sought after. This, along with their dozen or so meager acres of land, was the family's main source of income.

Though only in her early forties, Madam Cui's hair was already half-white from overwork, her face deeply lined. Yet her hair remained neatly combed, her worn clothes clean and tidy, her dignified bearing a far cry from that of an ordinary village woman.

As a child, Qin Ziling had heard whispers that his mother came from the prestigious Cui family of neighboring Qinghe County.

But from the time he could remember, Madam Cui never spoke of her family, nor had there been any contact between the two households.

"Mother, you've worked hard. Let's have breakfast first," Qin Ziling said softly, his gaze filled with filial respect.

Coming from modern society, he had not only merged with this world's Qin Ziling's memories but also his emotions.

And having taken over this body by chance, it was only right that he fulfill the original owner's filial duties.

"My, it's already morning," Madam Cui said with a smile, setting aside her work and rising to join Qin Ziling in the main hall.

The wooden table held several black steamed buns, a plate of scrambled eggs with scallions, a dish of greens, and a pot of thin porridge.

As Madam Cui and Qin Ziling entered, Yin Ranyue quickly ladled porridge for each and even pulled out a chair for Madam Cui.

Madam Cui and Qin Ziling sat, but Yin Ranyue remained standing.

"Ranyue, sit and eat with us. From now on, you don't need me to call you each time," Qin Ziling said, looking at her.

"Mm!" Yin Ranyue responded with a blush before sitting down.

Madam Cui said nothing, only glancing at Qin Ziling with a trace of approval in her eyes.

Once seated, Madam Cui and Yin Ranyue each took a black steamed bun, eating it with greens and porridge, avoiding the scrambled eggs.

"Mother, Ranyue, have some eggs too," Qin Ziling said, moving to serve them.

"You need the nourishment for martial training—it takes a toll. The eggs are for you. We do lighter work, and we're women—this is enough," Madam Cui replied.

"Yes, Young Master, your training is most important!"

Touched yet helpless, Qin Ziling felt a deep shame and powerlessness.

In his ten days here, he'd learned that martial training demanded immense energy. A few eggs were far from enough to build strength.

Those who truly excelled in martial arts all ate meat and medicinal herbs daily—some even feasted on exotic beast meat, if they came from wealthy families.

But the Qin family, now impoverished, could barely afford his martial school fees, let alone meat or herbs. Exotic beast meat was beyond imagination.

Exotic beasts lived deep in the mountains, fearsome and savage. Even experienced hunters dared not venture far to hunt them—only martial masters who'd cultivated their strength to the "Jinli" level would brave the depths.

And even then, hunting exotic beasts was perilous, usually requiring teams of three to five.

"Without meat or herbs, no matter how hard I train with this body's mediocre foundation, it's pointless!" Qin Ziling sighed inwardly, though he couldn't voice it.

A mother knows her son best. Though he said nothing, Madam Cui seemed to read his thoughts. "Ziling," she said quietly, "I know you're ambitious, wanting to master martial arts like your grandfather and restore our family's glory. But we're no longer what we were. Without nourishment, your path will be a thousand times harder. If you feel it's impossible, it's better to make other plans early."

"Mother, I want to keep trying," Qin Ziling replied without hesitation.

Given a second life, how could he resign himself to being an ordinary farmer in a small village?

Moreover, this was an era of chaos—where the strong preyed on the weak, bandits roamed, and war raged. Without martial strength, not only could he not protect his family, but his own life would hang by a thread.

No matter how difficult or slim the hope, Qin Ziling wouldn't give up now.

"If that's your resolve, I'll support you," Madam Cui said with mixed emotions.

"Thank you, Mother." Qin Ziling's nose stung at the sight of her gray-streaked hair and wrinkled face, and he lowered his head.

As he did, his gaze fell on his porridge bowl, and suddenly the ancient well from his nightmare flashed through his mind.

"Mother, is there a Taoist temple called Chixiao around here?" he asked abruptly.

"Chixiao Temple?" Madam Cui paused, then looked at him in surprise. "Why do you ask about Chixiao Temple?"
