# Chapter 23: Mid-Grade Marrow Cleansing Pill  

After reaching the fourth layer of the Spiritual Movement Stage, Lin Xuan encountered a problem—the efficacy of the Marrow Cleansing Pills had significantly diminished, making his cultivation progress slow and arduous once more.  

The path of immortal cultivation grew increasingly difficult as one advanced. Clearly, as Lin Xuan's strength improved, the low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills could no longer meet his needs.  

Normally, if the quality of the pills was lacking, one could compensate by taking more of them. However, the *Pill Annotation* clearly stated that one should not consume more than nine Marrow Cleansing Pills per day.  

This presented a dilemma.  

After careful consideration, Lin Xuan decided to attempt refining mid-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills once again.  

According to the *Pill Annotation*, the daily limit was nine pills, but it didn’t specify the grade. In other words, while one could take up to nine low-grade pills per day, the same applied to the more effective mid-grade pills.  

Since the low-grade pills were no longer sufficient, his only option was to aim for mid-grade ones. When he had first discovered the wonders of the blue star sea, Lin Xuan had tried refining mid-grade pills but failed after much effort.  

Now, however, the circumstances were different. Back then, he had only been at the second layer of the Spiritual Movement Stage, whereas now he was at the peak of the fourth layer. Moreover, the blue star sea grew in tandem with his spiritual power. With his increased cultivation, the star sea had expanded significantly.  

Lin Xuan couldn’t guarantee a hundred percent success, but with the low-grade pills becoming ineffective, refining mid-grade ones was his only choice.  

Once he made his decision, Lin Xuan began his attempt. He first rested to restore his spirit, magic power, and the star sea in his dantian to their optimal states.  

Then, he sat cross-legged, took out a low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill from a jade bottle, and held it in his hand. He released his divine sense—now that he had reached the fourth layer of the Spiritual Movement Stage, not only had his spiritual power increased, but his divine sense had also grown stronger. At full strength, it could cover a ten-meter radius, allowing him to perceive even the slightest movements, such as an ant crawling or the sound of a needle dropping. It was a marvelous sensation.  

Of course, this was nothing compared to the legends of high-level cultivators, whose divine sense could scan hundreds of miles, or Nascent Soul cultivators who could traverse the void with their consciousness. But those were mere legends—Lin Xuan, at his current level, had no chance of encountering such beings.  

Right now, refining mid-grade pills was his priority.  

With this in mind, Lin Xuan began mobilizing the blue light points within his body. Countless blue lights gathered together, forming a beautiful ribbon that traveled along his meridians. Previously, this process had been arduous, but now it was much easier. After refining thousands of discarded pills, he had become highly skilled. Additionally, his strengthened meridians could now bear the strain more effectively, making the process smoother than before.  

Soon, the light points reached his right wrist. Lin Xuan focused his divine sense entirely on the pill.  

Immediately, something wondrous happened—the Marrow Cleansing Pill appeared magnified in his mind, allowing his divine sense to penetrate its interior and clearly distinguish the essence from the impurities.  

Carefully controlling the flow of the blue light points, he guided them into the pill in an orderly manner, initiating the refinement process. Inside the white pill were black impurities that diminished its efficacy. Refinement meant removing them.  

This process was extremely difficult because the impurities were tightly intertwined with the essence. However, the blue light points could differentiate between the two—they passed effortlessly through the white essence but pushed the black impurities outward.  

Unlike refining discarded pills into low-grade ones, where the impurities were solid particles that could be easily moved, the impurities in mid-grade refinement were semi-liquid and viscous, making separation much harder.  

For the same volume of impurities, one light point had sufficed before, but now at least three to five were required. His previous attempt had failed because the energy of his blue star sea had been insufficient. Now, the question was whether the expanded star sea could sustain the refinement to completion.  

Refinement couldn’t be paused—it had to be completed in one go. If interrupted, the pill would be rendered useless, becoming true waste that even Lin Xuan couldn’t salvage.  

Before attempting, Lin Xuan had estimated a success rate of over seventy percent under normal circumstances. However, since this was only his second attempt at mid-grade refinement—the first having ended in failure—he couldn’t rule out unexpected complications.  

But even if problems arose, it didn’t matter. He had plenty of low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills to spare. Failure wouldn’t be a loss—he could simply learn from the experience and try again. Just as refining discarded pills into low-grade ones had initially been clumsy and inefficient before becoming effortless with practice, this too was a process of mastery.  

With this mindset, Lin Xuan proceeded boldly, unafraid of failure.  

At first, everything went smoothly. Though moving the semi-liquid impurities consumed more energy, the expanded star sea seemed sufficient.  

However, when the impurities were nearly separated from the essence and pushed to the pill’s edge, they refused to budge further—they couldn’t be expelled.  

Why was this happening?  

Lin Xuan frowned but remained calm. Panicking wouldn’t solve anything—he needed to analyze the situation rationally.  

Focusing his divine sense on the pill’s edge, he noticed that, unlike the interior, the outer layer was also semi-liquid.  

"Ah, I see," Lin Xuan mused while maintaining the flow of blue light. When refining discarded pills into low-grade ones, the impurities were solid particles, making expulsion easier. But with mid-grade refinement, the impurities were semi-liquid and sticky, making them harder to remove.  

That must be the reason!
