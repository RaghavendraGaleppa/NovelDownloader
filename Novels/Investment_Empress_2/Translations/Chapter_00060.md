# Chapter 60: "Big Brother Li Wants to Have a Baby with Me?!"

Three days later.

At the entrance of the Murong estate, the carriage that had brought them here stood quietly parked.

The porridge shop was still open, and many of the Murong family's younger generation had come out to see them off.

"Xiao'er, train diligently under Young Master Li. Do you understand?"

"If you lack anything, let the family know."

Murong Hai stood at the entrance with his hands behind his back, every wrinkle crinkled with kindness. Looking at him now, he didn't seem as imposing as when they first met; he was more like an ordinary old man.

"I understand, Grandfather."

Murong Xiao nodded seriously. He looked around and scratched his head.

"Where's Brother Li?"

"I'm here."

A voice drifted over with the wind.

But before the sound fully arrived, the person was already there.

Murong Xiao turned his head and discovered that Li Mo was already standing on the carriage's shaft at some unknown time, his robes gently swaying in the wind.

"Wind Shadow Step?"

He was stunned.

How did Brother Li know their family's superior inherited footwork technique?

"I gave this technique to Young Master Li just three days ago."

Murong Hai could only sigh now.

He could clearly see it.

The move Young Master Li just displayed had clearly already reached a minor success level.

It seemed he was very suited to this technique, had an epiphany, and on top of that, possessed outstanding comprehension.

"Brother Li, have you been studying the Wind Shadow Step these past few days? No wonder I haven't seen you."

"Not entirely."

Li Mo shook his head slightly.

He had mastered the Wind Shadow Step on the first day.

His talent in footwork was actually quite average; he had basically used up all the martial arts insights he gained from helping ordinary people.

"Oh, right, and training too." Murong Xiao said, somewhat understanding.

Li Mo played with the ring in his palm, smiling without speaking.

For the past three days, most of his time had been spent researching how to leave the aura of the World Seed on the Ancient Meaning Ring.

This was truly not a simple matter; it required an immense amount of energy.

Li Mo had used many Six-Striped Pills just to restore his spirit and energy.

Fortunately, he succeeded in the end.

Now, the Ancient Meaning Ring, after being guided by Li Mo, had successfully left a 'backdoor' for the World Seed.

The coachman arrived.

"Grandfather, we're off now."

"Old Master Murong, let's keep in touch."

Li Mo also waved his hand from outside the carriage.

The carriage slowly began to move.

The refugees and beggars lining the road who had come for grain looked up at the carriage, their numb expressions suddenly showing a spark of life.

They all knew.

The Great Benefactor Li had said that even after he left, the charity hall would continue to operate.

"Take care, Great Benefactor Li!"

"Once I make it big in the future, I'll definitely build a shrine for you!"

"Wishing you great success in your martial path!"

...

Listening to the thanks from both sides of the road.

Being seen as hope by so many people for the first time, an unusual emotion surged in Li Mo's chest.

He let out a long breath and lowered the carriage curtain.

"Please, head to Mud Corner Alley first."

"Alright."

The coachman hurriedly agreed.

Now, he couldn't dare not listen to Young Master Li.

Even the young clan head had to listen to him.

...

Mud Corner Alley.

Inside the civilian residence, there were still many piles of broken and worn-out items, but it was no longer as lifeless as before.

These past three days, Li Mo had come every day.

And every time he came, he would cook for them.

"Why hasn't Big Brother Li come yet today?"

"Will Big Brother Li bring candied hawthorns today?"

"I want to eat 'Donkey Rolling in the Dust'..."

"You guys only know how to eat."

The little beggars were busy in the courtyard.

Suddenly, the mute kid, A-Ba-A-Ba, cried out. He had the sharpest ears, and the little beggars all ran to the entrance of the courtyard.

Sure enough, the sound of a carriage was coming.

"Big Brother Li."

"Today, I'll make you guys lotus leaf chicken and roasted meat. It's very simple; you can make it yourselves in the future."

Li Mo entered and chatted with them as usual. During this time, he had long become familiar with this group of little rascals.

"Go... Good morning."

Jiang Chulong greeted timidly.

Her face was still deliberately smudged like a little cat, so her complexion couldn't be seen.

But her voice had much more strength to it, indicating her body was much better.

---

She even had the strength to help now.

"I... I'll help... you cut vegetables."

"Sure."

Li Mo shook the water droplets off his hands.

But for a long time, Jiang Chulong didn't make a move.

Her timid voice came again.

"I... I don't have... a knife..."

"Here."

Li Mo casually took the Chixiao Sword from his waist and handed it over.

Coincidentally.

The usually aloof Chixiao Sword had been very agitated these past few days; it was like a cat seeing catnip whenever it saw Jiang Chulong.

Once it was in her hands, it was incredibly well-behaved, cutting whatever she told it to.

Thus.

The precious Xuan-level artifact was temporarily used as a kitchen knife.

"This... this... you actually use this to cut vegetables?"

Murong Xiao stuttered upon seeing this.

"It's... it's not... very convenient."

"This sword... isn't good."

Jiang Chulong stammered in reply.

Murong Xiao: "!"

Li Mo: "..."

The Princess's sense of value was strangely peculiar.

A bag of rice was treated like a treasure; a hundred silver bills could keep her little mouth agape for half a day.

Yet, when faced with Xuan-level artifacts or Fire Sparrow Plumes, she treated them as common items.

Little Li had curiously asked her about this once.

And thus, the following conversation occurred.

"People... will die... without eating..."

"What about silver bills?"

"Silver bills... can buy... food..."

"Don't you think this sword can be exchanged for a lot of silver?"

"Can it? But I've... seen many... better than this before..."

Including pills, Xuan-level artifacts, she always felt precious items were common.

Probably because these things, precious to ordinary people, were commonplace to her in the past.

So... she was completely ignorant of common sense.

For example, yesterday she picked up a rattle drum, and after Li Mo fixed it, she treated it like a rare treasure.

It was quite something.

It could be considered a kind of没见过世面 (unworldliness).

Not long after, the meal was ready.

This time, however, Li Mo didn't eat with them.

Instead, he called Jiang Chulong to the side and first took out a piece of paper from his chest.

"This is the deed. It's for this abandoned residence. From now on, you guys aren't refugees or beggars; you are the masters of this place."

"Ma... Master?"

Jiang Chulong took the deed in a daze, carefully folded it, and then put it into the brocade pouch containing the Fire Sparrow Plumes.

"And this."

Li Mo took out the Ancient Meaning Ring from his chest.

Without a word, he put it on her slender finger.

Jiang Chulong: "!

Mother said that rings are usually tokens of love!

If a man gives a ring to a woman, it means expressing admiration. If she accepts it, it means they have decided on a lifelong commitment.

And还会...还会生小寶寶 (will also... will also have babies).

Accepting the ring = will have babies soon.

That was what Jiang Chulong believed.

Big Brother Li was very handsome, very gentle, could tell interesting little stories, and could cook...

But... but she wasn't ready yet!

If she refused, he would definitely be very heartbroken...

"Little Stutterer?"

Jiang Chulong across from him seemed to have suddenly crashed.

Even through the dirt on her face, one could see her blushing to the point of dripping blood.

Li Mo reached out in confusion and waved his hand in front of her eyes.

"Big Brother Li... this... this... this is..."

"Oh, this item was also entrusted to me by someone to give to you."

Little Li directly shifted the blame to the Ice Cube.

Since it was something the Ice Cube gave, she should accept it, right?

"So... that's how it is..."

Jiang Chulong's body relaxed, but she felt a bit dejected.

Wearing the ring, her calmed heart felt a sense of loss, as if something was missing.

"Then I'm off."

"Where... where are you going?"

"Back to the Qingyuan Sect, but don't worry, I'll be back after a while."

Watching the youth walk to the entrance and bid farewell with a smile.

Jiang Chulong bit her lip, watching him walk out step by step.

For some reason, she found the courage to call out:

"Big Brother Li... wait."

"You... you haven't... seen my... my appearance yet."
