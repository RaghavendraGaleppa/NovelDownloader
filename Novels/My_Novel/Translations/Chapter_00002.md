Chapter 2: Better Pain Than Numbness

Li Xian was stunned, his movements freezing in place. "Brother, what's wrong?" Li Xiaofan asked.

Li Xian smiled and patted his brother's head. "Nothing, little brother. We must work hard so that no one else can bully us."

It seemed his transmigration hadn't been without its cheat abilities.

He practiced his fist techniques over and over with unwavering determination, believing that persistence could move mountains.

"Brother, rest assured! The winter examination is just over a month away. I will not let you down," Li Xiaofan said resolutely.

"Good brother, let's eat. It's been a long time since we've had meat."

Li Xian's eyes grew moist. Since their father's death, the two brothers had relied on each other. The elder had shouldered the responsibility, and the younger had matured early. But the world was harsh, and doors were tightly shut, making it impossible to gain even a foothold.

Now... they could finally see a glimmer of hope.

The two brothers only had one set of clothes between them, so naturally, they had no pot to boil water or cook meat. Every blade of grass and tree outside the forest was controlled by landlords, aristocratic families, and powerful clans.

If they lit a fire and smoke rose from the chimney, guards would immediately come looking for them. They would at least suffer a severe beating.

They could only go to the house of Aunt Liu next door to borrow her stove. Aunt Liu's family was slightly better off; at least they had clothes to wear and勉强 had the appearance of a family.

That night.

Li Xian changed into a servant's uniform and returned to the One Union Manor.

From today on, he was no longer a free man but the lowest and most despised servant within the One Union Manor.

But if you can't even fill your stomach or keep yourself warm, what good is freedom!

"I don't seek fame or fortune now. I only wish to find a place to shelter myself in these troubled times," Li Xian sighed to himself. Behind the high walls and grand courtyards, he wondered how his brother was doing.

"You lot are sensible enough; no one tried to run. Since everyone is here, let me teach you the rules of this place."

The person who came to receive the new servants was not Luo Fang from the day, but his nephew, "Bi Hao."

"This entire manor, as well as the twenty thousand mu of fields outside and twenty-nine mountain peaks, all belong to our Manor Mistress," Bi Hao announced.

Speaking of this, Bi Hao puffed out his chest with pride, as if sharing in the glory.

"The Manor Mistress has recently gone out and won't be back for a few days. Don't say I didn't warn you, you lowly beasts. You'd best keep your eyes in check and not look around recklessly. If you offend the Mistress, be careful you don't get disabled."

"The Mistress's beauty is breathtaking, a first-class beauty. There was once a servant who was mesmerized by the Mistress upon seeing her. His eyes were dug out and thrown into the river."

Hearing this, everyone felt a chill in their hearts.

"Alright, from now on, you will labor in this area. Work hard. If you get whipped and your skin is torn open, hehe... it'll be hard to keep your life."

The manor was vast, with mountains and rivers, housing thousands of servants, yet it still seemed spacious, with a subtle shortage of manpower.

Li Xian, with memories from two lifetimes, had seen the world. Yet, he was still amazed.

"This is the servant's quarters. You will live here from now on. Tomorrow, at the fifth watch, you must get up to work. Anyone who oversleeps, don't blame me for stripping them naked," Bi Hao said coldly.

The servant's quarters were not large, yet they accommodated over a hundred people. The smell was indescribably foul—a mix of foot odor, body odor, and sweat, accompanied by teeth grinding, farting, and sleep-talking.

Snoring rose and fell, creating a "lively" atmosphere.

The beds were pressed tightly against each other, with not a bit of space left. Words like "clean" and "comfortable" were worlds away from this place.

"A manor this large is surprisingly stingy with its servants," Li Xian thought.

There were eleven similar servant quarters, arranged in a row. Yet, there were only five latrines for the toilet.

Since he was here, he had to adapt.

The next day.

Li Xian was assigned to clean an abandoned house. The manor had twenty pavilions and seventy-two elegant residences. It seemed the work was never-ending.

Li Xian and three other new servants were led by two veteran servants to a house that had been abandoned for a long time.

One of the veteran servants ordered, "You, go sweep over there. You, go pull the weeds. You, go clean the latrine."

One of the new servants asked, "What about you guys?"

"废话 (Fèihuà - nonsense). We naturally have our own matters. Hurry up, no more talk. On your first day, you want to be lazy already?"

The veteran servant looked at them with utter disdain.

Li Xian frowned slightly but said nothing. He honestly followed the orders and went to clear the weeds in the backyard of the building.

There were many weeds here, their roots deep in the soil, making them very difficult to pull. After doing this kind of work for just two or three quarters of an hour, one's waist would become sore and painful.

Li Xian patiently pulled them out one by one.

[Skill: Weeding]
[Proficiency: 12/500 (Novice)]
[Description: Pulling weeds, pulling weeds, a minor skill, a minor skill. A three-year-old child or an eighty-year-old man could do it. It's easy to reach Novice, but reaching Mastery depends on fate.]

The cheat interface popped up. Every time Li Xian bent over to pull weeds, he gained something, gradually grasping the knack.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]

His speed grew faster and faster, and pulling weeds didn't seem as tiring anymore.

[Proficiency is full.]
[Skill: Weeding]
[Proficiency: 0/1000 (Mastery)]
[Description: Back against the sky, feet on the ground. Though this path is minor, it holds a unique charm. Young man... have you realized something?]

In this world, whether it's a skill or a martial art, it can be divided into six stages: Novice, Mastery, Small Success, Great Success, Perfection, and Pinnacle.

At this moment, Li Xian, in the art of weeding, was already equivalent to a servant who had practiced for several years.

"A servant's life is not their own. How can there be free time? If I finish my work too quickly, I'll surely be sent to do other tasks."

"It's better to intentionally slow down and use this spare time to improve my abilities."

And so, during the breaks from weeding, Li Xian would occasionally stop and throw a few punches at the air, practicing the Wild Bull Fist. The Wild Bull Fist only had "three stances," and a full set took only a few seconds.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]

Li Xian became more and more adept. With every punch, he intuitively felt his progress.

He worked until evening, stopping for lunch in between. Although it was bland, it was enough to fill his stomach.

[Proficiency is full]
[Wild Bull Fist (Incomplete Stance)]

[Proficiency: 0/1000 (Mastery)]
[Description: The stance is incomplete, but the intent is not. The wild bull is fierce, and its punch is startling.]

Li Xian felt a warm current slowly flowing towards his lower abdomen.

"This is... Internal Force?"

"This world has Internal Force?"

Li Xian sensed this warm current. He couldn't name it, as he had never been exposed to the path of a warrior.

But he knew clearly that this thing was beneficial and harmless!

"Not bad, not bad. This feeling is truly peculiar. It's as if my whole spirit has been lifted."

He tried to control the warm current with his will, attaching it to his fist, and threw another punch. The force of the punch increased significantly, and as it rubbed against the air, a faint "moo" of a wild bull could be heard.

"Incredible."

Li Xian was overjoyed, but he didn't dare to get carried away. He quickly lowered his head and continued weeding.

It was getting late.

Bi Hao walked to this abandoned building, inspecting the servants' work one by one.

"What the hell is this sweeping?" he roared. In the corner of a wardrobe, he lightly ran a finger along it, picking up a speck of dust. He immediately erupted in a torrent of curses, punching and kicking.

The servant was beaten to a bruised and swollen face, not daring to make a sound.

Selling oneself to others, though it ensures food and clothing, the hardship and humiliation had to be swallowed down.

"You, your work doesn't meet the standard. Don't even think about resting tonight. The laundry room is short on hands, so you go help out."

Bi Hao waved his hand dismissively and continued to check elsewhere.

"Who did this latrine?" Bi Hao's face turned terrifyingly dark as he arrived at the restroom.

"It... it was me," a new servant stammered. Judging by his age, he was about the same as Li Xiaofan, only eleven or twelve years old.

"What is this?"

Bi Hao pointed at a patch of filth, glaring down at the servant.

"F-filth," the servant said, confused.

"Lick it clean," Bi Hao said coldly.

"Ah... ah?" The servant was stunned.

Bi Hao sneered, grabbed the servant by the hair, and pressed his face into the filth. "What 'ah'? Lick it clean for me!"

"I'll lick... I'll lick."

The servant humiliatingly complied. Bi Hao's gaze swept over the众人 (crowd), warning them, "I'm telling you, don't think this is just an abandoned house. The people who can live here are the Mistress's friends from the Jianghu. For such figures, even their excrement and urine are fragrant, like gold!"

"Don't even mention you lot. Even if it were me, if the Mistress ordered it, I would obey without question and consider it an honor!"

Then, Bi Hao looked at the servant. "Is it fragrant?"

The servant, afraid of being beaten, nodded quickly. "Fragrant, very fragrant."

"Hahaha!"

Bi Hao laughed a few times and said, "That's more like it. This is what a servant is. A servant who has sold himself. If you had a special skill, you might have some use and status. But do you have any?"

The crowd remained silent. Some had numb expressions, while others had already accepted their fate. But Li Xian shook his head internally. No matter how difficult the environment or how lowly the status, a spark of spirit must never be lost!

Even in death, it must not be lost!

Next, it was Li Xian's turn.

"You're the one weeding?" Bi Hao looked at Li Xian with a meaningful expression.

"Yes," Li Xian nodded.

"Good."

Bi Hao walked to the backyard, touching the whip wrapped around his waist.

Compared to sweeping and cleaning the latrine, weeding was the hardest. The former, after being taught a lesson, could be handled with enough care. Weeding... was the most tiring and the hardest to pass.

Either you couldn't finish pulling the weeds, or you made a mess of the ground. Weeding servants... usually got whipped!

However, when Bi Hao reached the backyard, he was dumbfounded. "Where are the weeds?"

"I've already pulled them all. They're on the cart," Li Xian pointed to a cart nearby.

Bi Hao confirmed it was true, then stomped on the ground. He was immediately amazed. Not only had the weeds been pulled, but the ground had also been re-packed firmly.

This young man either had experience as a household servant or was meticulous and thorough in his work.

"Hmm, not bad, not bad. What's your name?" Bi Hao rare smiled.

"My name is Li Xian," Li Xian said truthfully.

"Li Xian?" Bi Hao shook his head. "That's not a good name. Not for a servant."

"You did well today. You can go to the accounting office and collect three coins as a reward. Rest well tonight. Keep it up tomorrow."

"Thank you for the praise, Master Bi."

Li Xian shouted as usual. At this moment, his bowing and scraping was not a loss of spirit, but a calculated蛰伏 (hibernation) after认清 reality (recognizing reality).

Hearing the words "Master Bi," Bi Hao felt his whole body tingle with pleasure. He patted Li Xian on the shoulder and laughed, "Hahaha, kid, you know how to handle things."

On the way back.

A new servant ran over to strike up a conversation. "Brother Li, how did you do it? Can you teach me?"

Li Xian saw that they were all pitiable people and was willing to guide them, but he didn't know how to explain it. He could only smile and say, "There's no trick. I'm just used to it."

"A flatterer, and he says he's 'just used to it.' Tch," a veteran servant sneered disdainfully.

They had also been new servants once, knowing how to avoid certain pitfalls to protect themselves. At the same time, they enjoyed seeing newcomers stumble.

"We're all servants. Why must you be so confrontational? If you had given them a hint or two during the day, these two young brothers wouldn't have had to suffer such great humiliation," Li Xian frowned.

"A hint? A hint my ass," the veteran servant said dismissively.

"Brother Li, don't say that. I felt terrible at the time, but thinking about it now, Master Bi was right. I don't feel it's a humiliation anymore," the servant who cleaned the latrine said numbly.

Li Xian wanted to say something but swallowed it down. He lamented that this manor truly had a demonic quality. It made both the oppressors and the oppressed indulge in power.

Becoming heartless and numb, gradually assimilated.

Shit is shit. No matter how powerful a person is, shit still stinks.

Li Xian clenched his fists, his fingernails digging into his palms, silently warning himself: one can be humble, but one must not be numb.

"If I want to make life easier, perhaps... I should secretly learn some other skills."
