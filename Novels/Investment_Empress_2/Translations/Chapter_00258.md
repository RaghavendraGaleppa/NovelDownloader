# Chapter 258: This Is Undoubtedly a Genius of the Mingjiao Clan!

“Don’t!”

Wu Dameng was greatly shocked, his gaze toward Li Mo filled with terror.

This young man looked gentle and refined—how could such fierce words come out of his mouth?

Seeing his expression, Li Mo couldn’t help but feel puzzled.

Didn’t Elder Qian say this phrase was a way to express friendliness?

“Ahem, I was just joking.”

Li Mo waved his hand and said, “My friend and I came from outside the Southern Frontier to the Black Water Marshes to find relatives. We just wanted to ask about the Mingjiao Clan’s territory.”

“What do you want to know? I can’t say anything involving the clan’s secrets.”

Wu Dameng grew wary. “Besides, you’re both clearly humans. How could there be any relatives of yours in the Mingjiao Clan territory? You must be mistaken.”

“We’re not mistaken.”

Li Mo pondered for a moment.

Suddenly, he activated the Seventy-Two Transformations. His form shifted within the clouds, transforming into a Mingjiao several dozen feet long.

Although his size wasn’t as massive as Wu Dameng’s, his aura was even more ferocious.

“Impossible... impossible...”

Wu Dameng couldn’t believe it, yet the suppression from his bloodline made him tremble slightly.

“How could there still be Mingjiao existences outside the Southern Frontier?!”

“Because I have an excellent transformation technique. You didn’t see through my true form earlier, did you?”

Little Li boasted proudly.

See?

I told you—the First Qingyuan Sect’s Best Actor title is truly well-deserved...

“So... you’re one of our own?”

Wu Dameng was stunned for a moment, then looked at Huang Donglai.

“Is he also a Mingjiao?”

Huang Donglai: “.....”

He didn’t have Li Mo’s transformation technique.

Just as he didn’t know how to respond—

Li Mo quickly came up with an idea. “He’s my mount.”

“Ah?”

Huang Donglai’s body trembled.

Murong Xiao stroked his chin, deep in thought.

Wu Dameng hesitated. “A mount? I’ve only heard of human geniuses capturing dragon-serpents as mounts. You...”

“Exactly! Human geniuses can take demonic beasts as mounts—why can’t demonic beast geniuses take humans as mounts?!”

“Gasp...”

Wu Dameng leaned back in shock, his pupils trembling as they gradually filled with a light of wisdom.

That’s right!

Why should demonic beasts have to serve humans as mounts?

Recalling the fierce scene of Li Mo riding Huang Donglai and charging toward him at high speed, Wu Dameng completely believed it.

A genius.

This was definitely a genius of our Mingjiao Clan!

That’s why he had such a fierce aura!

No wonder his strength was so immense!

“Then is this human also your mount?” Wu Dameng looked at Murong Xiao.

Murong Xiao exchanged a glance with Li Mo, then released the White Jade Sarira, no longer suppressing his bloodline.

The next moment, the characteristics of a dragon-serpent appeared on him.

“An *Ren’yao*?!”

Wu Dameng exclaimed in shock.

Li Mo: “.....”

Murong Xiao: “?”

Huang Donglai: “Kukuku...”

“Humans are born from humans, demons are born from demons. Those born from both are *Ren’yao* (human-demons).”

“*Ren’yao* are incredibly powerful—they can use demonic bloodlines while also practicing human martial arts.”

Wu Dameng didn’t understand why the others suddenly fell silent.

He felt the term *Ren’yao* was quite fitting.

“Mount-brother, stop laughing for now.”

Li Mo gestured for Murong Xiao to calm down, then said, “We came here this time to find relatives for my friend Murong. His parents are in the Mingjiao Clan territory.”

---

“Murong...”

Wu Dameng’s large eyes rolled, as if remembering something.

He blurted out, “You’re Third Uncle’s child?”

“Third Uncle?”

“Yes! Uncle Murong married Third Grandmother, so he’s Third Uncle. Does that mean...”

A heavy silence fell over the scene.

In other words, Wu Dameng had to call Murong Xiao... Uncle?

This was truly a case of the flood washing into the Dragon King’s temple.

Why do I say that?

Li Mo was thinking—if back then, Old Man Murong had said he wanted to be sworn brothers with him, and he had agreed that day...

What would Wu Dameng have to call him?

“How are my parents now?” Murong Xiao asked nervously.

“Ah... the clan has been quite complicated lately.”

“Alright, let’s set off then.”

Li Mo transformed back into human form but retained some Mingjiao characteristics.

“Before we go, could you... untie me first?”

WWu Dameng’s eyes were filled with tears.

Being tied up like a ball—how could he still face other demons?

After being untied, he recovered his half-human, half-dragon form—a dragon head with a human body. Clearly, his transformation wasn’t perfect.

Watching Li Mo return to human form while only keeping some Mingjiao traits, he couldn’t help but feel envious.

They boarded the bronze carriage and headed south.

Li Mo adjusted to the Mingjiao traits on his body, then checked the investment feedback he had just received.

**[Nine Dragon Serpent Strength Pill]:** Refined from the souls of nine fierce dragon-serpents. Permanently increases strength after consumption. Those with weak physiques should use with caution. The medicinal effect is too violent and may damage the body.

This was a fierce, tiger-wolf-style pill.

From the description, even a martial artist at the Observation Realm who focuses on body refinement would likely struggle to digest it.

But no one in the Observation Realm could have perfected a body-refining technique either.

“I’ll find a secluded place to take it later.”

Li Mo retracted his thoughts from the system space.

The burly man opposite him, Wu Dameng, spoke up: “By the way, Brother, since we’re one of our own, why did you hit me?”

“That’s how Mingjiao outside the Southern Frontier greet each other.”

“Truly fierce, surviving outside the clan territory. As expected of our kind.”

“By the way.”

Li Mo looked at the increasingly close Mingjiao Clan territory and asked, “You mentioned earlier that the situation in our Southern Frontier clan is complicated. What exactly is going on?”

“This matter...”

Wu Dameng let out a heavy sigh.

“Our Mingjiao Clan has lived in this Black Water Marsh for a long time, but in recent years, our territory has been shrinking.”

“The Peng Clan has a blood feud with us. Over the past few decades, they’ve been constantly encroaching on our land.”

“It’s all because sixty years ago, they obtained the Heavenly Divine Jade.”

Heavenly Divine Jade...

Li Mo knew this was likely what the demons called the Jade Phoenix God.

“Every sixty years, the Heavenly Divine Jade returns to the Southern Frontier, and each clan sends their new generation to compete for it.”

“The clan has been in an uproar lately over the名额 for competing for the Divine Jade. After all, even just seeing the Divine Jade once is a great opportunity.”

“Over the years, Third Uncle and Third Grandmother have been blamed and pressured by other dragons quite a bit.”

Wu Dameng said helplessly.

Murong Xiao’s breathing grew heavier instantly.

Li Mo was puzzled: “What does competing for the Divine Jade have to do with pressuring Murong’s parents?”

“Half-demons are more likely to gain insights from the Divine Jade.”

“So what were they forced to do?”

“To have a second child. Naturally, they had to do what I told you earlier.”

“Huh?”

“Ask for Baba...”

“.....”
