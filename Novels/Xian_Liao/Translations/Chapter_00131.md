# Chapter 131: The Minor Dan Yuan Gathering (Combined)

A month later, Zhou Qing felt that the qi of Heart Fire Thunder, Liver Wood Thunder, and Kidney Water Thunder had become incredibly pure and harmonious. Simultaneously, his spiritual consciousness had increased by a full ten percent.

In addition, his blood qi and physical strength had also improved.

"Truly worthy of being a spiritual item that can increase the probability of forming a Golden Core by thirty percent. It directly acts on qi, body, and spirit, enhancing all three while further refining and harmonizing the innate primordial qi. Unfortunately, since I already possess the Dao Furnace, my essence, qi, and spirit have long been perfectly harmonized. The effects of the Jade Liquid Returning Pill won't be as significant for me as they would be for ordinary qi cultivators."

Zhou Qing felt slightly regretful, but this also confirmed one thing: his cultivation of the Dao Furnace had already laid the foundation required for qi cultivators to form their Golden Cores during the Foundation Establishment stage.

Practicing the Five Organ Thunders was about enhancing his innate primordial qi.

The true thunder qi of the Five Organ Thunders constituted Zhou Qing's innate primordial qi.

Once the Five Organ Thunders were fully cultivated, he could use the innate primordial qi stored in his five organs to open a domain—a capability typically only possessed by Golden Core cultivators.

Domains were essentially miniature versions of the legendary divine immortal abodes.

As a domain expanded, it would become an immortal's abode. Even ordinary people living within it could enjoy long lives free from illness.

It was akin to the Buddhist concept of the Pure Land.

Once Zhou Qing's Five Organ Domain was formed, infused with the qi of the Five Elemental Thunders, any enemy trapped within would face a human-shaped minor heavenly tribulation as Zhou Qing casually unleashed the Five Elemental Thunders.

Moreover, the Five Elements were the foundation of the world's structure. With further development, they could give rise to a small world capable of trapping powerful opponents.

At the same time, he could cultivate the Taiyi Primordial Divine Light to counter all Five Elemental techniques in the world.

"Since I haven't fully mastered the Five Organ Thunders yet, taking another Jade Liquid Returning Pill would mainly increase my blood qi and physical strength. Moreover, the effects of spiritual pills diminish with each use. It seems I should hold off on taking another pill for now and wait until the Five Organ Thunders are fully cultivated. Opening the Five Elemental Domain will then come naturally."

Zhou Qing made his decision.

Additionally, each successful batch of Jade Liquid Returning Pills yielded nine pills. Currently, he was running low on Blood Dragon Mushrooms, though he still had enough Longevity Jade Liquid for another batch.

As for the dozens of other rare spiritual herbs, even the four major demonic sects would have struggled to gather them all.

However, Zhou Qing had accessed the herb garden of the Divine Water Palace, which contained a wide variety of spiritual herbs that largely met his needs for refining the Jade Liquid Returning Pill.

"To refine another batch of Jade Liquid Returning Pills, I'll need to find a way to obtain more Blood Dragon Mushrooms from the Blood Demon Sect. There's no rush, though. After I break through to the Golden Core level, I can try to 'borrow' a couple of Blood Dragon Mushrooms from the Blood Demon Sect—or see if Jin Guang has any left."

---

Zhou Qing estimated that Jin Guang would likely use his Blood Dragon Mushrooms after this beast tide.

As for the Jade Liquid Returning Pills, Zhou Qing couldn't possibly trade them before reaching the Golden Core level. Fortunately, he had the Mortal Realm; otherwise, the phenomena from pill refinement in the Jingyang Dao Domain would be impossible to conceal, likely attracting raids from demonic beasts.

The Jade Liquid Returning Pill was also highly effective for fifth-tier demonic beasts at the late Foundation Establishment stage, aiding their advancement to the Golden Core level.

Although Zhou Qing had reconciled with Jin Guang, if Jin Guang reached the Golden Core level before him, his attitude might change.

Once Zhou Qing formed his Golden Core and successfully refined another batch of Jade Liquid Returning Pills, the pill's thirty percent boost to Golden Core formation probability could very well allow the Dao Court to produce several Golden Core cultivators within the next century.

---

"The effects aren't as significant for me as I imagined, but for ordinary late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, they're truly invaluable. Elders and Brother Zhang, each of you can take one now and another when you attempt to break through to the Golden Core."

Fu Shan waved his hand. "I won't take one yet. Since Junior Brother Fu Song and Daoist Zhang are joining this beast tide, they should take one now to boost their strength."

Fu Shan had stepped back to focus on pill refinement and teaching disciples. In the Mortal Realm, he wasn't in a hurry to improve his cultivation, preferring to build a solid foundation.

Though his progress seemed slower than Fu Song's, his foundation was incredibly stable.

He planned to merge with the Pear Tree Demon only after Zhou Qing reached the Golden Core level.

For now, Fu Shan prioritized stabilizing the Mortal Realm as their stronghold.

Zhou Qing nodded and distributed the Jade Liquid Returning Pills. Yuan Mingyue and Xiao Ruowang, who were responsible for logistics in the Mortal Realm, didn't need the pills yet.

Meanwhile, Lin Wan'er's advancement to the Earthly Melody stage had significantly boosted Zhou Qing and Yuan Mingyue's spiritual consciousness during their daily music sessions. The effects were less pronounced for Zhang Jingxiu and the others, as Zhang primarily used the Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture to eliminate the hidden dangers of demonic seeds.

Zhou Qing also noticed that the Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture's effects on him and Yuan Mingyue were enhanced by their close relationship with Lin Wan'er.

Lin Wan'er and Yuan Mingyue often performed together, their hearts gradually growing closer.

Lin Wan'er had even taken the sobriquet "Qingfeng" (Clear Breeze) to complement Yuan Mingyue's "Mingyue" (Bright Moon).

Soon after, Fu Song and Zhang Jingxiu eagerly went into seclusion to absorb the pill's effects and prepare for the beast tide.

---

Zhou Qing knew that having them take the Jade Liquid Returning Pills now was incredibly extravagant and wasteful.

But weren't pills meant to be consumed?

"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."

In truth, if Zhou Qing offered the Jade Liquid Returning Pill to Jin Guang, Jin Guang would likely be eager to become his sworn brother.

Unfortunately, Zhou Qing wasn't yet at the Golden Core level and couldn't afford to support a sworn brother who might form a Golden Core with the pill's help.

After taking the Jade Liquid Returning Pill, Zhou Qing's mana became exceptionally pure. When using the Thousand Illusions technique, he could effortlessly retract his mana into his organs without revealing any abnormalities.

Now, with the Thousand Illusions concealing his cultivation, even early Golden Core cultivators might be easily fooled.

At most, they might sense that his physical cultivation was unusual, mistaking him for a body cultivator.

After distributing the pills, Zhou Qing received a message from Xiao Ruowang.

---

**Mortal Realm, Great Snow Mountain**

The three major temples of the Esoteric Sect had been converted into Daoist monasteries, guarded by water-cultivating disciples of the Dao Court.

"A newly appeared demon?" Zhou Qing observed a tea tree sapling atop the snow-covered mountain peak. Amid the icy landscape, this touch of green stood out starkly.

"So far, it hasn't shown any aggression. Agricultural experts have found that its leaves can be used to make tea, which detoxifies, reduces heart fire, and aids in comprehending cultivation techniques—though the effects are minimal."

Zhou Qing: "Apart from that, this sapling is continuously absorbing the lingering ghosts and spirits from the Esoteric Sect in the snow region."

Xiao Ruowang: "Exactly. The spiritual energy atop the mountain has become much purer. But I'm concerned about what might happen if we let it grow unchecked, so I wanted your decision, Zhou Zhenren."

Zhou Qing pondered briefly: "Why don't you use the Demon Seed technique to deepen your connection with it and observe it periodically?"

"That's what I thought too. Since you agree, we'll proceed accordingly."

Zhou Qing nodded and asked, "How are the spirit fields coming along?"

Xiao Ruowang: "I was just about to report. The low-tier spirit rice has responded well to fertilizers made from demonic beast remnants. But to expand the fields, we still lack sufficient fertilizer. As for the premium Dragon Pattern Rice, using the residue from your recent pill refinement has yielded excellent results. We've already harvested an early batch—I brought some for you to try."

Zhou Qing smiled: "Good. Later, I'll use Qingyang Spirit Fire and some spiritual water to prepare it. You mentioned fertilizer shortages—meaning we don't have enough demonic beasts. The beasts we brought from the Jingyang Dao Domain, combined with those native to the Mortal Realm, are barely enough for the Dao Court's current disciples. But as our numbers grow, the supply won't keep up. However, large-scale spirit rice production can meet the daily cultivation needs of low-tier disciples. The spirit fields are crucial. During the upcoming beast tide in the Jingyang Dao Domain, my master and I will gather more demonic beasts. Moreover, the beast tides occur every ten years—each one will be a harvest for us. There's no need to worry too much."

Before Jingyang Zhenren disappeared, he had also used demonic beast flesh and blood to fertilize spirit fields.

The most important condition for cultivating spirit fields was a stable and suitable environment.

The Mortal Realm, in its spiritual energy resurgence, was uniquely suited for spirit field cultivation.

Long-term consumption of spirit grains not only reduced pill toxicity but also mitigated the燥性 (dryness) caused by consuming demonic beast flesh.

Historical records in the Jingyang Dao Domain mentioned ancient sects cultivating spirit fields for spirit grains.

The methods weren't complicated, but the conditions were hard to meet.

Since Jingyang Zhenren's time, only he and Zhou Qing had been capable of large-scale spirit field cultivation.

It was undeniable that the two of them stood out as luminaries across eras.

Though Zhou Qing considered himself second to none, he still held Jingyang Zhenren in high regard.

After sampling the Dragon Pattern Rice, Zhou Qing took the remaining portion back to the Jiangzhou Herb Garden.

---

Zhou Qing pruned some mulberry branches from the Great Mulberry Tree, dried them with the Water Control technique, and ignited them with Qingyang Spirit Fire.

The female Blood Demon Sect cultivator Qin Qing's storage pouch contained a pottery jar that gathered spiritual energy, functioning as a small cauldron for cooking spiritual ingredients.

Zhou Qing used the jar to hold some mulberry dew from the Great Mulberry Tree, mixed it with spiritual water from the spring Yuan Mingyue had dug in the courtyard, and cooked a pot of spirit rice.

The aroma filled the herb garden, whetting their appetites. They quickly finished the rice, savoring not just its cultivation benefits but the sheer enjoyment it provided.

Zhou Qing smiled: "As for the low-tier spirit rice, Wan'er, discuss with Mingyue how to use it for brewing spirit wine."

Lin Wan'er's eyes lit up, then she remarked, "I remember you don't drink much."

Zhou Qing: "Ordinary wine harms cultivation, but spirit wine should be different. Tang Jieyuan also enjoys wine—see if he has any ancient brewing recipes."

Lin Wan'er chuckled, "Tang Jieyuan's wife just gave birth to a daughter. It might not be the best time to bother him."

Zhou Qing raised an eyebrow: "Wife? That adopted daughter of Merchant Shang?"

Lin Wan'er nodded: "Merchant Shang passed away earlier this year. Some of his descendants have joined the Dao Court."

Zhou Qing acknowledged this. After he killed Shang Bing, Merchant Shang had proactively sought peace and facilitated the recruitment of Confucian scholars from the Ancient Classics Academy to the Dao Court.

Recognizing his cooperation, Zhou Qing hadn't troubled the Shang family.

The Shang family, in turn, dared not seek favors from Zhou Qing.

Some Shang descendants had joined the Dao Court with Zhou Qing's approval.

Given that Shang Bing's lineage had died out, a branch of the family had been adopted to continue it.

The Shang family now only hoped for a few descendants to enter the immortal path, with no further ambitions for political power.

Their initial misalignment, though later corrected, had permanently excluded them from the core of power.

However, even cultivators were subject to the cycle of life and death.

Within the Dao Court, factions would rise and fall naturally.

Family lineages and master-disciple relationships would form the main factions. These two systems would inevitably intertwine.

Zhou Qing had no intention of preventing this—it was inevitable.

Human nature dictated it.

Moreover, internal competition was beneficial.

A monolithic hierarchy would only burden him without yielding benefits.

"The wise may err; the foolish may stumble upon wisdom."

Zhou Qing couldn't guarantee he wouldn't make mistakes, so he needed a "fool" to remind him.

Fortunately, as the wise one, Zhou Qing already had the perfect candidate.

"Second Senior Brother, it's you!"

While Fu Shan and Zhang Jingxiu maintained a certain distance in their interactions with Zhou Qing, Fu Song was the one who would immediately point out Zhou Qing's mistakes.

Their shared experiences during the imperial examinations in Changzhou had forged a deep bond.

After consuming the Dragon Pattern Rice, Lin Wan'er experienced a breakthrough. The rice's vitality infused her body, enhancing her blood qi.

Her Deer Song Longevity Scripture naturally advanced to the fourth layer of Qi Refining—the level once attained by Qing Lingzi.

Though primarily a qi cultivation technique, it also improved physical cultivation, allowing Lin Wan'er to reach the first layer of Body Refining.

Zhou Qing clapped lightly: "Congratulations, Wan'er. You've taken another step on the path of longevity."

Lin Wan'er blushed: "I've wasted so many resources and only reached the fourth layer."

Without the Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture, it would have taken her another decade to reach this level.

Zhou Qing smiled: "You've earned it. It's not a waste."

Lin Wan'er first felt joy, then a hint of melancholy.

Zhou Qing guessed the reason and comforted her: "Your grandfather can't cultivate in this lifetime. But cultivation is about turning the impossible into possible. If I ever transcend life and death, I might use great divine abilities to revive him—and even you."

Lin Wan'er was both amused and curious: "Would that still be me?"

Zhou Qing: "That would depend on you, not me. I might even revive Fu Song and the others."

What could have been a somber topic became lighter with Zhou Qing's words, dispelling Lin Wan'er's sorrow.

Life was lived in the present.

Lin Wan'er resumed her cultivation, while Zhou Qing checked Yuan Mingyue's pulse.

Though the All-Seeing Eye would provide the clearest assessment, it would be inappropriate to use it unnecessarily.

The restrictions formed by Qingyang Spirit Fire were stable. After checking her pulse, Zhou Qing said, "Mingyue, you won't need to worry about the Profound Yin Qi acting up for a long time. You can cultivate without concern."

Yuan Mingyue: "Master, since the Profound Yin Qi episode, I occasionally dream of formations—terrifying ones capable of destroying heaven and earth."

Zhou Qing pondered: "Your Profound Yin Qi isn't accidental. Given your extraordinary talent for formations—even comprehending teleportation arrays—I've long suspected you might be the reincarnation of a powerful figure. These dreams aren't surprising."

"Will I become someone else?" Yuan Mingyue worried.

Zhou Qing: "If you don't want that, grow stronger. And your master will keep growing stronger too."

He couldn't predict the outcome, but with sufficient strength, all problems could be resolved. For now, these weren't pressing issues.

Yuan Mingyue: "Master, it seems there's nothing in this world you fear."

Zhou Qing: "You're mistaken. I fear things too. But fear doesn't solve problems. I choose to solve them first."

After their conversation, master and disciple resumed their cultivation.

The Mortal Realm was a haven, but that didn't mean it was eternally safe.

Zhou Qing knew that without sufficient strength, everything they had could vanish in an instant.

Seeking immortality was about preserving this beautiful world, and growing stronger was about protecting what they had.

"As heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman should constantly strive for self-improvement."

Three more months passed.

As the beast tide drew nearer, Zhou Qing received an invitation from Jin Guang a month before its arrival.

"Minor Dan Yuan Gathering."

The invitation detailed a trade meeting near Tianxuan City, open only to mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators or above—the main force for the upcoming beast tide.

The gathering aimed to allow participants to exchange resources and familiarize themselves with one another—essentially a salon for Foundation Establishment grandmasters.

Since Fu Song and Zhang Jingxiu had emerged from seclusion, the three of them attended together.

At the very least, Fu Song was at the mid-Cauldron Furnace stage, while Zhang Jingxiu was nearing the late stage.

As Fu Song put it, he was at the "peak of mid-Cauldron Furnace, great perfection."

---

The gathering was held on a mountain near Tianxuan City, surrounded by ancient trees in a serene environment.

No formations or restrictions were set up.

With so many Foundation Establishment cultivators gathered, even an early Golden Core demon would struggle.

The divide between Golden Core and lower stages was profound.

Historical records rarely mentioned instances of pre-Golden Core cultivators defeating Golden Core opponents.

But a large group of Foundation Establishment cultivators could still pose a significant threat to an early Golden Core being.

Zhou Qing brought not only Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song but also Ang Ri.

Upon arrival, Jin Guang came to greet them.

Noticing Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song, Jin Guang inwardly startled and hesitated to approach.

Staying clear of body cultivators was a lesson learned through the bitter experiences of countless qi cultivators.

The rivalry between body and qi cultivators was ancient.

Legends spoke of the "Heavenly River Sect," which had both body cultivators practicing divine demon physiques and qi cultivators mastering great divine abilities. The two factions clashed violently, leading to a pyrrhic victory for the qi cultivators.

Body cultivators excelled in initial assaults, but once qi cultivators withstood the first wave and deployed their techniques and artifacts, the body cultivators' advantage waned.

Jin Guang paused before greeting them.

Just then, a massive crane descended from the sky, carrying a long-bearded cultivator.

"Crane Immortal has arrived," someone exclaimed.

Zhou Qing knew of Crane Immortal—a recently advanced Foundation Establishment grandmaster who had sent only a ninth-layer Qi Refining disciple to the previous Tianxuan City meeting to stabilize his cultivation.

Fu Song had complained to Zhou Qing about this, remarking that only someone as tolerant as Shang Zijian would let a mere Qi Refining cultivator share their platform.

Zhou Qing surmised that Crane Immortal had taken advantage of Shang Zijian's good nature.

From Fu Song's description, Shang Zijian seemed like the Foundation Establishment equivalent of Zhi Shan.

Seeing the enormous crane, Fu Song frowned and said to Ang Ri, "Ang Ri, after all these years and all you've eaten, why haven't you grown bigger? Any random bird can crap on your head."

Ang Ri let out a piercing cry, sharp as a drawn blade.

The crane, hearing the cry, froze as if encountering a natural predator and plummeted to the ground in a cloud of dust.

Crane Immortal, with his grandmaster cultivation, remained unharmed, but the humiliation of his mount being frightened was undeniable.

He glared at Ang Ri: "Whose unruly beast is this?"

Fu Song: "This spiritual beast belongs to the Daoist."

Crane Immortal tensed, ready
