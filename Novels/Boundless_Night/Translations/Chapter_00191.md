# Chapter 191: Two Nobodies Turn Arrogant Brutes

Wu Yaozu whispered, “Brother, that woman in black is looking at me again!”

Qin Ming also sensed something and said, “I told you, that’s your imagination. Do you know how to deal with this kind of situation? Just ignore her.”

Wu Yaozu glanced at him, grumbling, “Brother, I think you’re going to die alone.”

Then, he took a sharp intake of breath, "Hiss, I carefully sensed it, and it seems she’s looking at your back? I take back what I just said.”

Wu Yaozu perked up, “Brother, do you know her but are deliberately ignoring her? Is there some past between you two?”

Little Wu’s perception was indeed unusually keen. Few could detect the hidden gaze of experts at the level of Master Wu and Tang Jin.

“Let’s go!” Qin Ming quickly walked forward, afraid he would spout nonsense. This kid had just come out of a forbidden land, and when he focused on something, he got particularly excited.

Wu Yaozu nodded, following along, “Is this what my grandma called the colorful mortal world? Gatherings and partings, a moment’s glance back, and even in a vast sea of people, one can find an unchanging gaze from the past. Such an encounter surpasses all the mornings and evenings.”

Qin Ming wanted to cover his mouth. He quickly pulled him into the crowd, afraid that Tang Jin and Master Wu’s spiritual perception might be too keen, allowing them to intercept their conversation from the surrounding noise.

“These two youngsters have extraordinary perception; they can even notice that?” the purple-eyed crow said, then cackled as if hearing something.

Beside it, Tang Jin, whose graceful figure was enveloped in wide black robes, had a slightly darkened expression. She whispered, “What are you laughing about? It’s dreadful!”

“Caw-caw-caw, it truly is an unexpected encounter.”

“You shut up!”

***

Under the night sky, Shanhe Academy was bustling with people, like a festival, figures everywhere.

Qin Ming saw the sixteen-year-old scalper crow and asked with a smile, “Sister Crow, what’s the ticket price now?”

“Flying Dragon in the Sky!” Sister Crow stood haughtily on a tree branch at the crossroads. Her business was indeed good. She said, “You two will regret not buying earlier; the ticket price has doubled.”

“Really?” Wu Yaozu’s eyes widened. He thought, if he had known, he should have hoarded some back then. If they sold today, his and Brother Ming’s tuition fees would be settled.

Sister Crow turned her back to them and said, “Tickets are hard to come by now. Even I can only get a few for some VIP clients through special channels.”

It was busy, surrounded by people buying tickets.

“Don’t you two think? That’s a peak showdown between a quasi-ancestor master’s personal disciple and a heaven-defying prodigy who swept through eighty-one cities! It has rocked Kunling City, known far and wide.”

Wu Yaozu rubbed his hands, his eyes fervent, “Sister Crow, I think you could also sell tickets to my spars with my brother.”

Sister Crow rolled her eyes, “Hmph, you two nobodies. Even if you paid people to watch, I doubt anyone would come.”

Beside them, some of the people buying tickets nodded in agreement.

“Yeah, brother, it’s not me talking you down, but even if you had half a month of warm-up, no one would bother.”

Wu Yaozu half-jokingly boasted, “Brother, I’m not bragging, but those two well-known prodigies tonight, I could pin them to the ground and beat them.”

“Brother, you’re something else. You really dare to dream. Alright, I’ll wait to see your name in the nightly gazette someday.”

“This young man sure dares to speak; he can brag more than my grandpa when he’s had too much to drink, and he’s in a wheelchair!”

A group of people burst into laughter.

Sister Crow said, “Why don’t you two bite the bullet and buy two tickets, go inside, and see how strong that ambitious young ancestor master, who wants to test his sword against the world, truly is? Even if you don’t possess their cultivation or talent, you can learn from their demeanor and presence during this grand event; that would also be an improvement.”

Wu Yaozu said, “Am I crazy? Buy tickets to watch two people who might be even weaker than me fight? Impossible! Sister Crow, if you gave us two tickets, I might consider it.”

Sister Crow said, “Then I’d definitely be crazy!”

Not far away, a commotion stirred. As several women passed by, many people discussed them. The leading woman seemed to have a distinguished background; her graceful figure from behind was quite captivating.

Sister Crow whispered, “See that? That’s Liu Hanhya, the most beautiful senior sister in our Shanhe Academy. Her talent is astonishing, and she’s amassed a deep foundation before a sudden breakthrough. She’s already been noticed by an elder from the Immortal Land, and her future is limitless. Even she’s going to watch this showdown. When you two can attract the attention of such immortal-level figures, then I can sell tickets to your fights.”

“Those are Liu Mingzhe and Tang Jun, who haven’t shown their faces in a long time. Even they’ve come out of seclusion to watch!”

“Oh, that’s Luo Lianqing, the Immortal Flower from the neighboring Feixian Academy. The few men and women around her also have significant backgrounds; all have very deep cultivation.”

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu stood at the intersection, listening with great interest to the crowd’s discussions, learning about many famous individuals.

Kunling could be called an academy city. Many renowned disciples from various Daoist temples and academies had indeed arrived, all prominent figures, sparking fervent discussions.

Today, Shanhe Academy was truly overflowing with popularity.

Fiery springs snaked, illuminating every corner of the academy. Even Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu’s dormitory area, that dark patch of forest, was now brightly lit.

The two toured the academy for a long time. Once the novelty wore off, and without tickets, they returned to their lodging, only to find too many outsiders wandering around, making even their area anything but quiet.

“I think we don’t need to be so low-key; we should change places to live.”

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu both felt that their current living environment was poor. Anyone could come here, the noise was excessive, and there were mosquitoes, which, though they couldn’t get close, made for a bad experience.

In comparison, that picturesque area in the distance where fire springs flowed was much better. Outsiders were not allowed inside, making it very peaceful.

That area was primarily for disciples of the Immortal Path and Mystic Sect, but others could also fight their way in and take over.

“Let’s go!” Being men of action, they grabbed their bags and left the place. They didn’t think they would fail and wouldn’t need to return.

***

Ahead, beautiful peaks were adorned with fiery spring waterfalls, colorful dragon carps swam in the lakes of open areas, immortal mist flowed through bamboo groves, ancient medicinal herbs perfumed the cliffside regions, and purple qi permeated the air.

“The scenery is excellent, truly pleasing to the eye!”

The two were very satisfied and decided to live here.

It was late evening, and the place grew even more serene, with only pleasant bird calls sounding from the fiery red vines. A few immortal cranes leisurely strolled in the distant wetlands.

“You two, stop.” Someone blocked their way, immediately identifying that they were not students living there.

“We’re here to pick a residence,” Wu Yaozu said.

The person blocking them was speechless. These two were truly confident; they even brought their luggage. However, he didn’t make things difficult and simply asked them to register.

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu exclaimed that the place was really nice. There were houses by the lake and residences built on spiritual mountains, most of which were occupied by famous students of Shanhe Academy.

The two chose suitable residences, not wanting to be too high-profile. They decided to replace this year’s new students and move into their lodgings, not competing with the older students.

However, their timing was very bad.

Because today was a special day.

Almost all students had gone to watch the fight. Even without tickets, they wanted to feel the atmosphere outside the arena, discuss it with others, and know the results immediately.

“Isn’t there still over half an hour left? Why are they so eager?” Wu Yaozu complained.

“Over there, the two buildings by the lake still have people,” Qin Ming looked ahead.

The person who registered them and accompanied them was a senior student, a strange expression on his face, but it quickly vanished, not showing outwardly.

“Hmm, the people living there are indeed this year’s new students, but their strength is extremely high.”

“It’s fine; as long as the conditions meet our requirements, nothing else matters,” Wu Yaozu said.

***

A moment later, a group of people, over a dozen in total, rushed out of those two buildings. Each looked displeased, glaring at the two who had rudely disturbed them.

The senior student who had accompanied Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu seemed to regret it. He bowed in apology, saying, “These two insisted on coming over.”

A beautiful girl in yellow robes sharply retorted, “Are you two here to make a joke? Are you ignorant, or just plain foolish? Do you know what kind of place this is? How dare you come here to challenge us!”

Wu Yaozu didn’t like that. “Junior Sister, your words are really unpleasant; Little Wu is not pleased. I’ll just ask one question: are the people living here this year’s new students? I only give face to senior sisters and senior brothers right now. If it’s the same batch, who would I be afraid of?!”

The group, originally angry, now all laughed, but their eyes were far from friendly. Then they all spoke, with mockery and derision in their voices.

“You two must be crazy to want to be famous, aren’t you? You’re truly asking for trouble.”

“Brother, did you just come out of the mountains? Do you even know the situation of this year’s new students at Shanhe Academy? And you dare to speak so presumptuously here!”

Wu Yaozu’s face darkened, “You talk too much; I really don’t believe in evil. If the owners of these two houses are here, then come over and accept the challenge according to the rules, quickly! My brother and I are in a hurry; we’re waiting to move in!”

Immediately, the laughter from the other side stopped, and their expressions turned cold again.

The yellow-robed girl even clenched her fists, because her building next door was also included.

The senior student who had led them here wiped sweat, feeling he had been reckless today and should have sent these two naive youths away, but it was too late for regret.

A peerless white-robed young man stepped out, handsome and composed, with a faint smile on his face. “It’s still early, and I’m just idling. It’s a good time to warm up. Having someone to practice with should be a joy.”

His black hair flowed like a waterfall; he was quite handsome, his eyes as brilliant as stars, calm and confident, as if everything was under his control. He stood with his hands behind his back, looking at Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu.

He smiled slightly and said, “You two can come at me together. As long as you can defeat me, these two houses will be yours to live in.”

Wu Yaozu was displeased, “Brother, don’t be too arrogant. Speaking like that makes you seem a bit conceited. Who in this world would dare make the two of us team up? Sigh, I’ll be low-key. I’ll narrow the scope: I’m talking about our batch of new students.”

The group’s facial expressions nearly turned to stone!

“Where did these arrogant brutes come from?!”

“Just two nobodies, and they dare to come here causing trouble? I’d like to step in and swat them away myself!”

Everyone here was displeased.

Wu Yaozu was speechless. Who was arrogant, really? Didn’t the people opposite them underestimate him and Brother Ming first?

The unworldly white-robed young man calmly spoke, “Alright, one of you can come, or both of you can attack me simultaneously; the choice is yours.”

“To deal with you, I don’t need my brother to make a move; I’ll do it myself!” Wu Yaozu rubbed his hands. Then he looked at the yellow-robed girl, “Oh, and Junior Sister, this also involves your residence. If it’s really too much, you two can team up against me.”

“Arrogant brute!” The group was all enraged.

Wu Yaozu felt wronged and annoyed. Hadn’t he just imitated what the other person said? Why was he being treated with such an attitude? There was nothing more to say; he would just subdue them!
