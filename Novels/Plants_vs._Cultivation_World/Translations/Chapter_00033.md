# Chapter 33: The Yield Champion

As Gu Mo leisurely rode his crane toward the Spirit Plant Hall, a streak of sword light suddenly shot past him from the direction of the hall. The sword light abruptly turned around and stopped right before Gu Mo, revealing Mai Yunfa—the very person who had brought Gu Mo to the Spirit Plant Hall in the first place.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, come with me quickly!" Seeing Gu Mo, Mai Yunfa immediately pulled him onto his flying sword and sped back toward the Spirit Plant Hall.

"Senior Brother Mai, what's going on?" Gu Mo quickly assessed the situation in his mind. As far as he could tell, he hadn't exposed anything he shouldn't have.

"Elder Zhao is looking for you—it's good news." Mai Yunfa looked at Gu Mo with admiration. Having just come from the Spirit Plant Hall, he clearly remembered the shock on Elder Zhao's face.

**Half an hour earlier...**

The steward in charge of storing spirit rice had begun reporting this year's harvest to Zhao Qiancheng—the most important matter for the Spirit Plant Hall.

"The yield has dropped again this year?" Learning that the growth rate of spirit rice production was still negative, Zhao Qiancheng's expression darkened.

Though the decrease was minor, it was still a decline—and worse, it had been a slight but consistent drop for several years in a row. This was the most frustrating kind of trend.

It made the sect feel as though he, as the steward, wasn't doing his job properly. The primary purpose of the Spirit Plant Hall was to provide spirit rice for the sect. The yield directly affected the hall's benefits and resources for the coming year—as well as Zhao Qiancheng's own future prospects.

He had been focusing on increasing production for years, but the spirit fields in the valley had already reached their limit. There was no room for further improvement, and even maintaining the current yield was difficult. The slightest disturbance could cause a minor drop.

The only way to increase the hall's spirit rice production now was to utilize the scattered fields outside the valley. However, due to a lack of manpower, those fields still couldn't be fully cultivated.

Wait—wasn't there already someone farming the fields outside the valley?

"What was Gu Mo's yield this year?" As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Zhao Qiancheng's memory was sharp. He quickly recalled Gu Mo's situation.

"Elder Zhao, I was just about to report that." Hearing Zhao Qiancheng mention Gu Mo, the steward smiled—this was the pleasant surprise he had prepared.

In recent years, he had always brought bad news during these reports. But this year, he finally had good news to share, and he intended to make the most of it.

The steward immediately presented Gu Mo's yield for both harvests this year. When Zhao Qiancheng heard that Gu Mo's first harvest had yielded 500 jin of spirit rice, his expression shifted to surprise. For a first-time cultivator to achieve such a yield was truly remarkable.

But when he learned that Gu Mo's second harvest had soared to 800 jin, Zhao Qiancheng was thoroughly stunned.

An output of 800 jin per mu—that was enough to contend for this year's yield champion.

"Elder Zhao, the highest yield for Spirit Jade Rice this year was indeed 800 jin." The steward took the opportunity to inform him that Gu Mo had won the yield championship for the year.

"Good, good, good!" Zhao Qiancheng took a deep breath and uttered the word three times. The policy of leasing the outer valley fields to willing outer disciples had been his idea. Gu Mo was the first beneficiary of this policy, and the more outstanding Gu Mo's performance, the more it proved Zhao Qiancheng's foresight.

When Gu Mo learned that Elder Zhao wanted to see him about his field's yield, he was overjoyed. The yield champion received generous rewards—though the exact prize wasn't fixed and depended entirely on Elder Zhao's discretion. Still, anything given by a Foundation Establishment steward would be a treasure for a Qi Condensation cultivator like him.

Mai Yunfa, steering the flying sword, glanced at Gu Mo's excited expression and couldn't help but feel envious. In previous years, he hadn't paid much attention to the yield champion's rewards, but this time was different. He was certain Gu Mo would receive something far beyond the usual.

The reason was simple: Gu Mo had given Elder Zhao a reason to boast.

Under Mai Yunfa's full-speed flight, the sword soon landed before the Spirit Plant Hall's meeting hall. Gu Mo followed Mai Yunfa inside and saw Elder Zhao.

"Greetings, Elder Zhao!" Gu Mo bowed alongside Mai Yunfa.

"Not bad." Zhao Qiancheng studied Gu Mo. Though Gu Mo's cultivation hadn't improved much, his achievements more than justified the praise.

"You must have mastered a second Spirit Farmer technique by now," Zhao Qiancheng said confidently, considering Gu Mo's exceptional comprehension and his record-breaking yield.

Mastering two Spirit Farmer techniques in just over a year since joining the hall? This young man had the potential to become the fourth person in the hall to master all five techniques.

What a shame his spiritual roots were so poor. With such talent, he could have even become an inner disciple.

"Yes." Gu Mo answered respectfully. Now wasn't the time to reveal that he had already mastered all five techniques—that would be too shocking and draw unwanted attention.

Admitting to two techniques fit his established image as a quick learner and aligned with Elder Zhao's expectations. Keeping everything within the steward's predictions was the safest approach.

If Gu Mo were to claim he had mastered three techniques, it might impress Elder Zhao, but it would also invite scrutiny—something Gu Mo wanted to avoid at all costs.

"Since you've won the Spirit Jade Rice yield championship, the hall will reward you as usual." Zhao Qiancheng studied Gu Mo, considering what to give him.

Though Gu Mo's spiritual roots were poor, his comprehension was excellent. Compared to other outer disciples with both poor roots and poor talent, he was definitely worth nurturing.

"Have you heard of Spirit Plant Masters?" After a moment of thought, Zhao Qiancheng asked.

At this, Mai Yunfa's eyes widened in disbelief—he had guessed what reward Elder Zhao intended to give. While he himself had received such a reward as an outer disciple, it had never before been granted to an outer disciple.

"I'm afraid my knowledge is limited—I haven't heard of them." Gu Mo shook his head. Judging by the name, Spirit Plant Masters likely had something to do with plants, but he truly had no idea what they did.

"You can think of them as an advanced form of Spirit Farmers—a profession on par with alchemists, talisman masters, formation masters, and blacksmiths. The spirit seeds you receive have been cultivated by Spirit Plant Masters to achieve such high yields," Zhao Qiancheng explained.
