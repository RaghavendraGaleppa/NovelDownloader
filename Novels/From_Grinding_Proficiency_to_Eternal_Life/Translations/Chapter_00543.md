Chapter 543: The True Scripture of Heaven and Earth's Interchange, Yin and Yang's Separation and Union

His spiritual sense raced as he carefully observed the situation within Liu Yunhua. He discovered that her spiritual sea was not completely depleted. Instead, under a strange cycle, it had formed an internal, unbreakable barrier, locking away all her origins and displaying absolute "insulation" against the external devouring force.

Although Pu Yu was trapped by restrictions and unable to move her body, her mind was clear.

Seeing this scene, her cheeks flushed slightly. However, feeling the faint fluctuations of her Master's vital energy and the increasingly strong devouring field of Xu Yunfan, a complex, indescribable expression appeared on her face—fear mixed with a hint of inexplicable... relief?

She clearly sensed that the devouring force was primarily focused on Liu Yunhua. Although she wasn't being cultivated upon by Xu Yunfan, standing so close, she could still feel a slight牵引 force. However, this force seemed far more "gentle" than the backlash she had suffered when she initially tried to cultivate with the basic extraction method of the Hundred Desires Peak to absorb Xu Yunfan's essence.

She even faintly felt that if she were willing, she might be able to use the unique牵引 vital energy of her innate lust dao body to try and absorb a bit of Xu Yunfan's leaking pure yang thunder qi?

Just as she was secretly pondering whether this was possible, and what would happen if Xu Yunfan sensed it and instantly slapped her to death...

"Heh... hehe..."

A series of intermittent, mocking, and weak laughs came from Liu Yunhua's mouth.

She barely raised her head, her pale face, which had lost all of its enchanting charm, twisting into a sarcastic and wretched sneer. Yet, a trace of the pride belonging to the Peak Master of the Hundred Desires Peak remained in the depths of her eyes.

A Foundation Establishment True Person, excluding the three top sects of the Taihua Spirit Void Realm, was a figure capable of establishing a sect or founding a cultivation family elsewhere.

"Junior Brother Xu, save your energy... Ugh... Your pathetic little 'Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Method'... dares to try and cultivate upon Senior Sister me?"

She gasped for breath, continuing with difficulty, each word carrying a triumphant mockery.

"What I cultivate... is the 'True Scripture of Heaven and Earth's Interchange, Yin and Yang's Separation and Union'.

The core direct inheritance of my Hundred Desires Peak, the Great Dao True Art that points straight to the Golden Core realm. How could it be compared to that 'Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Method'... Hmm... That method is merely... merely the introductory chapter that mimics the breathing of the True Scripture."

Listening to Liu Yunhua's mockery, Xu Yunfan remained silent, merely accelerating his movements while channeling the qi and blood in his body downwards, making himself even more imposing.

"Perhaps Senior Sister could enlighten me?"

Watching the galloping Xu Yunfan, Liu Yunhua gritted her teeth and said.

"The 'True Scripture of Heaven and Earth's Interchange, Yin and Yang's Separation and Union'... emphasizes... seizing the creation of heaven and earth, and controlling the pivot of yin and yang.

It refines not only one's own lust spiritual power but also opens a true inner scene gate within the body... forming an indestructible yin-yang boundary of its own... With my mid-Foundation Establishment realm, this boundary may not be perfect... but relying on the Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Method, you think you can shake my foundation? In your dreams!"

"Heaven and Earth's Interchange... Ten thousand transformations in the same furnace! Those who have not comprehended the Great Dao of Yin and Yang... fundamentally cannot... forcibly pry open my inner scene gate!"

Her words were intermittent, yet filled with triumph and the final confidence to preserve her life.

This was her true foundation, and now it had become her only life-saving straw.

No matter how strong Xu Yunfan's strength was, if he did not understand the subtleties of Yin-Yang Separation and Union, and did not know the mysteries of Heaven and Earth's Interchange, he would never be able to truly devour her foundation.

Forcibly attempting to do so would only trigger the passive counterattack of the yin-yang qi within her body. Although it would be weak, it would be enough to cause fluctuations in the restrictions, giving those outside a chance to be alerted.

This was her opportunity to turn the tables. If she accumulated enough energy, she might be able to break free from her internal shackles in one breath and then give Xu Yunfan a severe blow.

In that way, the roles of attacker and defender would be reversed.

Xu Yunfan's surprise quickly faded, replaced by an almost cold understanding.

He stopped his movements, looking down at Liu Yunhua with deep, dark eyes, and the remaining devouring force dissipated.

So that's how it is.

Naturally, he knew of this scripture, but the price required to exchange for it was quite high, so Xu Yunfan had never considered it.

As a behemoth that had passed down its legacy for ten thousand years, how could the top true inheritance arts of the Origin Demon Sect be such "inconvenient" things?

He had also browsed the introduction to the 'True Scripture of Heaven and Earth's Interchange, Yin and Yang's Separation and Union' in the Scripture Pavilion of the Origin Primordial Sect. He knew its concept was lofty, but unfortunately, the exchange points required—just the introductory chapter needed ten thousand points—were truly not cost-effective.

The "Heaven and Earth's Interchange" of its true art versus the "Yin-Yang Separation and Union"—one is grand and magnificent, the other points directly to the fundamental.

It is by no means simply covered by the way of stealing yin to supplement yang or the dual cultivation of men and women.

The true core of this scripture was originally to build a self-sufficient, perfectly balanced "Inner Scene Heaven and Earth" or "Yin-Yang Boundary" within the body. Relying on this foundation, one could be invulnerable to external invasions and remain invincible.

At the same time, it was precisely because of this perfect foundation and principle that, upon reaching great perfection, one could truly achieve "all the essence of heaven and earth can be plundered," and all things in heaven and earth could be used as one's own cauldron.

Cultivating upon others was merely an extension of one of its overbearing means, not the core purpose.

Dual cultivation—how could it be such an inconvenient thing?

One can blend with people, with objects, and with heaven and earth.

This is the true Great Dao of the Demon Path.

Only in this way does it befit the status of a top true art of the Origin Demon Sect.

Its overbearing nature lies not in the ferocity of momentary plunder, but in the indestructibility of its own foundation and absolute dominance in the level of external plunder.

With this true art in hand, upon reaching great perfection, one naturally possesses the true confidence to control yin and yang and command the essence of all things.

The fruit it seeks is also extremely powerful.

"Senior Sister's words have greatly enlightened this Junior Brother."

Xu Yunfan spoke slowly, his voice carrying no anger, but rather a hint of excitement.

"Since the 'Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Method' is merely the foundation, then..."

He leaned forward slightly, his powerful aura condensing once more. A powerful spiritual sense, strong enough to make Liu Yunhua's expression change, pressed down, firmly locking onto her.

"Then please, Senior Sister, fulfill this Junior Brother's admiration for the 'True Scripture'."

He extended two fingers. A faint light flashed at his fingertips, and a wisp of the Divine Thunder power of the Heavenly Palace, condensed to the extreme and carrying the true meaning of the destruction of a proto-firmament, coiled around them like a peerless sword edge, slowly approaching Liu Yunhua's glabella.

He naturally knew how to perform a soul search. The Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Method relied on the cultivation method to make one's mind unclear and confused, allowing him to ask for the information he wanted.

But Liu Yunhua did not fall into this category.

He had to use another method.

The thunder light at Xu Yunfan's fingertip was cold and solid, carrying a will of destruction that could obliterate everything.

Although it was only a wisp, Liu Yunhua did not doubt for a moment that if this thunder light pierced her glabella, her soul would instantly turn to ash.

She wouldn't even be able to achieve reincarnation.

"Senior Sister has gone to great lengths. Please inscribe the complete method of the Foundation Establishment chapter of this true scripture, along with the Yin-Yang essentials, core key points, and taboos that you have comprehended..."

Xu Yunfan spoke word by word, his speed very slow, yet each word weighed a thousand jun, striking Liu Yunhua's crumbling heart one by one.

"Onto this jade slip. I swear by the Great Dao, if you are sincere and the recording is accurate, I will spare your life today."

(Reviewers!!! A bitter laugh)
