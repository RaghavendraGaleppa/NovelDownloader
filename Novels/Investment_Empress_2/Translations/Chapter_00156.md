# Chapter 156: If It Weren't for You, I Should Be Soaking in a Hot Spring!

Several Senior Brothers and Sisters in the Observation Realm looked into the distance.

They saw trees constantly toppling not far away.

Various fierce beasts, each with powerful auras, had eyes glowing red, having lost their sanity.

From their auras, most were of the Eighth Rank, with over a dozen at the Seventh Rank.

Among them, one had reached the peak of the Seventh Rank—a goshawk with white horns and feathers as hard as fine steel.

It was equivalent to a Ninth Aperture cultivator in the Observation Realm.

Strange.

When they had first arrived at the Rare Beast Peak, they had patrolled the area, and back then, these fierce beasts were quite docile.

Why had they suddenly gone into a frenzy?

Could it be...

*Whoosh!*

A signal arrow shot by Xu Zhiqing, exploding into a brilliant firework in the sky.

Then she shouted loudly, "Junior Brothers, split up and intercept them!"

As her words fell, the group simultaneously retreated.

Xu Zhiqing originally wanted to tell Li Mo to stay put, but by the time she turned her gaze, all she saw was a fleeting shadow.

*Swish.*

What just flew by?

Oh... it was Junior Brother Li.

Wait... it was Junior Brother Li!

In the haste of the moment, Li Mo had no time to use his Destiny Divine Eye; he could only try his best to intercept the fierce beasts.

The first one he met was a Seventh Rank fierce beast.

A giant bear covered in rock, as big as a small mountain, raised a paw and slammed it down toward Li Mo.

Xu Zhiqing was about to rush forward, but Ouyang pulled her back.

"We should go intercept them from another direction."

"But..."

"If you can't hold on later, just shout for Junior Brother Li to save you."

"???"

*BOOM!*

A loud noise came from not far away.

Li Mo's fists carried two streams of energy—one extreme cold and one extreme heat—like long dragons, crashing forward with a thunderous impact.

The massive body of the Rock Bear was sent flying backward, the rock armor on its chest instantly shattering as it crashed into several Eighth Rank fierce beasts.

The flying bear had immense destructive power.

Xu Zhiqing: "..."
Miao Jinyin: "...."

Ouyang: "I told you. Let's just go intercept the Eighth Rank beasts."

Little Li looked at his own fists.

He hadn't used any martial arts just now; he had only utilized the power of his two Xuan Dantians.

Among Seventh Rank fierce beasts, aside from those with special bloodlines, the Rock Bear's strength was almost at the top. Yet, before his power, it was like a child.

And this was with just two Xuan Dantians.

Once he had all 365 of them in the future, wouldn't he be a humanoid nuclear bomb at minimum?

"The Rock Bear's paws seem to taste pretty good."

"If we slaughter these beasts, we won't need to buy groceries for a long time."

Little Li began to acquire free ingredients at zero cost.

Of course, he didn't forget his duty.

He kept his Destiny Divine Eye active, searching for any trace of Yin Huaxuan.

Suddenly.

The white-horned goshawk, at the peak of the Seventh Rank, flapped its wings, stirring up a violent gale as its aura rose to its peak.

Its eyes were fixed on Li Mo, as if it was gathering all its strength to charge at him.

Li Mo subconsciously prepared to counter.

After all, it was a peak Seventh Rank beast; he had to show some respect.

Then.

The white-horned goshawk moved like lightning, charging forward with explosive speed.

However, it headed in another direction.

Li Mo: "...."

So you were trying to run?

He observed that Ouyang and the others were handling the Eighth Rank beasts without pressure, and he had already cleaned up most of the Seventh Rank ones.

Only then did he shoot forward like an arrow released from a bow.

...

Meanwhile.

On the Divine Weapon Peak.

Seeing the fireworks explode on the nearby Rare Beast Peak, several true disciples immediately stood up.

"Rare Beast Peak?"
"Didn't we already sweep that area? Is Yin Huaxuan still there?"
"Guardian Futu, we will leave this place in your care. We shall go investigate first."

After saying this, the true disciples flew toward Rare Beast Peak.

"Take care."

Futu slowly stood up. He looked into the distance.

From the forging pavilion, a figure carrying the aura of the weapon peak moved into the distance.

---

His eyes flickered as he concealed his entire aura.

Not long after, he arrived at his residence and opened a hidden door.

"Have they been lured away?"

A hoarse voice came from within.

The person inside the hidden door was none other than Yin Huaxuan. His aura had dropped significantly, far from what it used to be.

"Yes, Han He went as well."

Futu tossed over a bottle of pills and a human-skin mask.

Yin Huaxuan took the bottle and smelled it; realizing it contained Blood Spirit Pills, he immediately swallowed one.

"If this succeeds, the 'Flood Dragon Playing in the Waves' painting will surely be delivered to you."

After his aura recovered slightly, he gritted his teeth and said, "Unless we eliminate Shang Wu and Li Mo and take control of the Jade Beauty Peak, the great affairs of the sect will be difficult to achieve."

As his words fell, his aura and figure shifted slightly.

"This is not a place to talk."

Futu spoke.

"Good. As long as you can get me near the Stream Stone Forest, I have my own way to leave." Yin Huaxuan nodded.

...

Not long after.

Futu and a 'Murong Xiao' appeared on the Divine Weapon Peak.

One was a senior guardian of the Divine Weapon Peak, and the other was a true disciple favored by Elder Han He; naturally, they passed through unobstructed.

As they passed through the Stream Stone Forest.

Yin Huaxuan took out a strange whistle and blew a sound inaudible to the human ear.

*Whoosh!*

The white-horned goshawk landed, but its gaze looked behind it.

Yin Huaxuan relaxed slightly.

The white-horned goshawk he raised possessed a trace of an extremely diluted Great Peng bloodline. Its flight speed was as fast as lightning, and during long-distance travel, not even an Inner Scene expert could easily catch up.

However, just as he was about to mount the hawk's back and escape...

*BOOM!*

A loud noise echoed through the sky!

A figure, like a meteor, crashed heavily into the ground.

Yin Huaxuan: "?"
Futu: "?"

The two looked at the white-horned goshawk, their eyes filled with confusion.

What kind of thing did you bring here?

This didn't look like an Inner Scene expert, as there was no fluctuation of using a domain to fly.

The two exchanged a glance, neither daring to act rashly.

The dust settled.

They finally saw the figure patting the dust off his clothes.

"Crashed again, cough."

Li Mo patted the dust while taking a pill.

This damn hawk is fast!

Even with his two Xuan Dantians replenishing his true energy at extreme speed, he almost couldn't catch up.

Fortunately...

Huh?

Little Li realized something was off.

"Brother Murong?"

Seeing 'Murong Xiao' standing together with Futu not far away, Li Mo was stunned for a moment.

"Senior Brother Li, what are you doing here?"

'Murong Xiao' gave Futu a look and stepped forward.

"I chased that hawk here."

Li Mo raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"By the way, is it about time you returned that 'Love and Moon Mirror' you borrowed a couple of days ago?"

"I just happen to have it with me."

'Murong Xiao' fumbled in his chest and walked forward.

Meanwhile, Futu quietly circled to the side, preparing to launch a sneak attack.

Last time, Li Mo had used a secret technique, which must have come at a great cost.

Surely he couldn't have such a method again this time?

Three against one, with a sneak attack—the advantage was theirs.

However.

"Look, is this the one..."

'Murong Xiao' didn't even finish his sentence before the short sword in his chest stabbed out.

*Clang!*

The short sword was directly cut into pieces by the Chixiao Sword.

"You..."

"Brother Murong's eyes lit up when he looked at me, but yours didn't."

Li Mo's right hand dropped the hammer into his palm, and he smiled politely:

"My true energy is fully recharged now."

*BOOM!*

The Little Hammer, worth forty, came crashing through the air.

Accompanied by Little Li's roar:

"If it weren't for you, I should be soaking in a hot spring right now!"
