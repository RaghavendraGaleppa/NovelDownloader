# Chapter 15: Parchment

Without any hesitation, Zhou Qing stretched his legs and leaped, running like a deer, imagining the scenes of deer he had seen in the past, like imitating a tiger.

The way deer run in documentaries, the specific image of deer in zoos.

He constantly overlapped these images.

He had tried this process before, but he didn't know what he was doing wrong. Each time, he spent a lot of energy, becoming physically and mentally exhausted, and he couldn't grasp the essence of the deer like he could when imitating a tiger.

Today was different.

After cultivating the Tiger Play to perfect mastery and the Deer Play to the proficient stage, his mind and body seemed to have opened up.

Naturally, he grasped the essence of the Deer Play.

But Angri was even more agile, and Zhou Qing's first leap missed.

Zhou Qing temporarily leaned against the corner of the wall to adjust his breathing.

"Angri is much more agile than I imagined. How did the blacksmith Hu catch it in the mountains? His legs should have been far less nimble than they are now."

Zhou Qing felt a perplexing doubt in his heart.

"Could it be some kind of trap?"

Zhou Qing instinctively rejected this judgment. He felt that this matter was related to the blacksmith Hu's unique skills.

Black Tiger Fist was just the most superficial skill of the blacksmith Hu. If it was really valuable, how could he easily teach it to the students in the village school?

Possessing unique skills, having ventured out, practiced mysterious kung fu, and injured his leg, returning to Hu Village was obviously to avoid something.

Zhou Qing outlined a clearer persona for the blacksmith Hu.

However, he didn't plan to delve deeper into this secret now.

The blacksmith Hu was outwardly very polite to Zhou Qing, because of Zhou Qing's scholar status and his help in interpreting ancient texts.

If Zhou Qing insisted on getting to the bottom of it, who knew what trouble he would stir up?

Since Zhou Qing was already involved, he naturally had to analyze it and prepare himself mentally. But on the surface, it was best to pretend ignorance for the time being.

After a moment of thought, Zhou Qing adjusted his breathing.

He didn't focus his attention on Angri. The more he focused on Angri, the more vigilant it became.

He slowly visualized and outlined the essence of the deer.

His legs naturally relaxed, and a burst of heat suddenly arose in his waist and back. His leg bones exerted force, and his muscles felt a tearing sensation.

Hiss!

Zhou Qing suddenly burst out.

"Haha!"

Zhou Qing laughed, holding a feather in his hand.

Compared to not being able to catch anything just now, this was a significant improvement.

"That grab just now, the force was wrong, otherwise it wouldn't have just been tearing off a feather."

Grabbing requires force from the hands and the flexibility of the hands, which is exactly what the Tiger Play trains.

Previously, Zhou Qing obviously used the thinking of the Deer Play, without combining it with the Tiger Play's method of exerting force. Tiger and Deer combined?

Angri felt a jolt just now, almost getting caught by its master.

In desperation, it reluctantly approached the big mulberry tree. Its chicken eyes were full of incomprehension, as if saying, it hadn't offended its master, had it?

Fear, pity, and helplessness.

There was also a chill from the big mulberry tree behind it.

The branches and leaves of the mulberry tree swayed.

If someone deliberately observed the swaying posture of the mulberry tree at this time, listening to the rustling sound of the branches and leaves, they might have a hallucination.

Schadenfreude?

Of course, in the not-so-large courtyard, one person and one chicken continued their chase.

Finally, at the cost of Angri losing three feathers, the game ended.

Zhou Qing was a little unsatisfied, but the slight lengthening of his leg bones and the tearing sensation in his muscles reminded him that today's training could end here.

He hadn't even had time to use the wooden dummy to train his fist techniques.

He had no choice but to give up!

Zhou Qing had to admit that Angri had extraordinary spirituality. After Zhou Qing surprised it once, it immediately became vigilant. When Zhou Qing tried to repeat the trick, the result was failure.

One person and one chicken chasing each other in the courtyard had a bit of a battle of wits and courage.

Zhou Qing had a slight advantage, but there was also a price to pay.

Without paying attention, the Deer Play's training was approaching its current limit.

If he hadn't eaten snake meat and snake gall, the intensity of the chase just now, the short burst of power, might have left Zhou Qing paralyzed on the ground.

Now, lying back on the bed, Zhou Qing could clearly hear his heartbeat.

He was also a little mentally exhausted. He silently recited the articles of the sages, and his spirit slowly became lively again, while his heartbeat returned to a normal rate.

Familiar heat was already wandering in his legs, repairing the torn muscles. However, the slight lengthening of his leg bones obviously made him a little uncomfortable.

He felt a strange sensation in his legs.

"This is the limit of Deer Play training, accelerating my growth and development. It seems I can grow a little taller because of this," Zhou Qing analyzed calmly in his mind.

He also realized a problem from this, that is, carrying a load and using the Deer Play method to travel, although it had a little effect on the Deer Play's training, there was also a hidden danger.

That was, carrying a book basket to Hu Village was putting some pressure on his spine and affecting his growth and development.

His physical foundation was weaker than that of ordinary people, and he was not yet fifteen years old, which was a critical period for growth and development.

It had to be said that no matter how carefully he considered, there would be oversights. After all, martial arts training was a completely new challenge for him, in an unknown field.

Zhou Qing was now relying on some knowledge from books and movies, as well as information obtained through the blacksmith Hu, to slowly explore. Of course, the credit of the Nourishing Life Master was also indispensable.

Through this incident, Zhou Qing increasingly recognized the mystery of the Five Animal Frolics.

It was indeed a well-honed, centuries-old health-preserving exercise. Even if it hadn't been modified into a version more suitable for Zhou Qing himself, its well-honed characteristics could correct some problems caused by Zhou Qing's improper training.

For example, when Zhou Qing normally cultivated the Deer Play to the limit, it could eliminate the side effects of weight-bearing training that hindered development.

When the effect of the heat was exhausted, Zhou Qing took a cold shower and changed his clothes.

Now that it was hot summer, the well water, although cold, was particularly refreshing when poured on his body, which had been repaired by heat after exercise.

At the same time, Zhou Qing felt that he still had inexhaustible energy and none of the hunger he usually felt after overtraining.

It seemed to be the credit of the snake meat and snake gall.

Zhou Qing couldn't sleep too early, but today's training had been a bit excessive, so he had to stop. So he took out a tattered Analects and sat under the big mulberry tree, leaning against the tree's thick trunk. The coolness seeped through his clothes into his back, making him particularly comfortable and content.

It had to be said that the big mulberry tree in the courtyard was really a treasure.

It could shelter from wind and rain, and also provide shade.

At night, the moonlight shone through the gaps in the branches and leaves, the shadows of the branches danced, and the leaking moonlight was like accumulated water, illuminating the courtyard with indescribable poetic beauty.

Zhou Qing held a volume of the Analects in his hand, not reading, just using it as a decoration.

This way of reciting had a sense of ritual.

He was becoming more and more accustomed to the life of the ancients.

Moreover, the big mulberry tree had an excellent insect-repelling effect, and mosquitoes were extremely rare in the yard.

He used his Finger Flicking Skill to strike the trunk of the big mulberry tree. Some parts of the trunk had broken a little skin and had not yet healed. Now, sitting and leaning against the trunk, there was a faint fragrance, which was very pleasant.

Unconsciously, it was dusk.

The setting sun shone on the courtyard.

Zhou Qing stopped reciting, full of energy.

He closed the Analects and looked at the cover, unable to help but laugh.

It turned out that he had been holding it for too long, and the sweat from his palm had soaked through the cover. The ink of the word "Analects" had smudged a bit, making it look more like the word "Swing."

Swing Language?

Speaking of which, he was indeed becoming more and more like a strong and powerful scholar, reading the Swing Language, which was also fitting.

Dong dong dong!

Knocking on the door sounded.

There were many guests today.

As usual, Zhou Qing asked the person knocking on the door, "Who is it?"

"Zhou Master, it's me. The maid Chunxiang from the Lin Mansion."

"The maid from the Lin Mansion?"

Zhou Qing didn't remember knowing any maids from the Lin Mansion, but since it was from the Lin Mansion, they must have something to do with him.

He had to give the landlord face.

Zhou Qing opened the wooden door and saw the maid in front of him. She looked vaguely familiar, and when he carefully observed the half of her face covered by her hair, which was slightly swollen, he immediately realized.

"It's you?"

Chunxiang gave Zhou Qing a resentful look, lowered her head, and presented a long box, "This is the parchment that Miss sent to Zhou Master. Please accept it, otherwise, this servant will not be able to report back."

Parchment was now the best paper, even more exquisite than the widely sought-after Zuo Bo paper.

However, the cost of parchment was expensive. The official price was one hundred copper coins to buy a single sheet of parchment, and it was usually unavailable even at that price.

Because these kinds of goods were often supplied first to scholars with official titles, especially successful candidates in the imperial examinations.

After all, the paper used for the provincial and palace examinations was parchment.

If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools.

Knowing how to write neat and powerful articles on parchment would definitely be a plus in the provincial and palace examinations.

Zhou Qing had punched Chunxiang last time, although it was a misunderstanding, he was somewhat sorry for Chunxiang.

So the Lin family's Miss sent Chunxiang to deliver the paper.

As a scholar, Zhou Qing would naturally not refuse a good intention.

Zhou Qing took the box. This time, Chunxiang respectfully bowed again, preparing to leave.

Zhou Qing stopped her and asked her to wait outside the door for a while.

After a moment, Zhou Qing came out of the house, holding a paper package about half the size of his palm.

"I accidentally hit you last time. Inside are Five-Fragrance Pills, which have the effect of detoxifying and beautifying the skin. You can take them back and try them."

He thought that Chunxiang was the Lin Miss's maid.

He had verified that the Five-Fragrance Pills had no side effects, and long-term use would give the body a faint herbal fragrance. If Chunxiang took them back and tried them, and they had an effect, it would definitely attract the Lin Miss's attention.

Merchants were good at seizing business opportunities, and their opportunity for cooperation would naturally come.

The effect of seeing is believing was definitely more useful than Zhou Qing's lengthy explanations.

Moreover, Zhou Qing planned to find an agent to handle the Five-Fragrance Pills for him. The butcher Hu was a good choice. If he personally participated in the Five-Fragrance Pills business, it would definitely be inconsistent with his scholar status in the eyes of people at the time, and it would be undignified.

In the circle of scholars, being undignified could easily become a topic of conversation, giving people an opportunity to attack him, and even affect the imperial examinations.

Because scholars who participated in the provincial examinations needed not only to register, but also to have more than one scholar in the circle vouch for them.

How could a scholar with a bad reputation ask someone to vouch for him?

Therefore, some scholars who were poor and destitute were unwilling to find some livelihoods that seemed to lose face, also for this consideration.

It wasn't just blind pedantry.

Hearing about detoxification and beauty, Chunxiang, who was already worried about her not fully swollen face, couldn't help but brighten her eyes. Zhou Master wasn't a bad person either.

At that time, Zhou Master had treated her as a bad person.

It was understandable.

If she didn't forgive him, what could she do? He was a scholar, and still the top scorer.

Chunxiang was just a maid by the Lin Miss's side.

Therefore, she couldn't refuse Zhou Qing's kindness. She took the paper-wrapped Five-Fragrance Pills, thanked him, and left.

Zhou Qing watched her leave, seeing carriages waiting in the distance, and understood in his heart that the Lin Miss was also nearby.

If the Lin family didn't plan to recruit Zhou Qing as a son-in-law, it was best for the two of them not to have too much contact.

It wouldn't be good if rumors spread.

However, the Lin family also wanted to express their goodwill towards Zhou Qing.

The Lin Miss naturally attached great importance to the matter of sending parchment to Zhou Qing, so she followed.

The carriage was waiting in the distance. If Zhou Qing saw it, he would naturally understand the Lin family's intention of friendship. In this way, the Lin Miss's goal would be achieved.

From giving a one-coin rent discount to sending clothes and Huangjing, and now sending parchment.

The Lin family's goodwill was advancing layer by layer, with clear goals and well-founded advances and retreats.

In the future, if Zhou Qing became prominent and the Lin family had something to do, based on this good relationship, they wouldn't be turned away.

Of course, the Lin family might not rely on Zhou Qing.

But merchants diversified their investments, had many escape routes, and made good connections, which was their nature.

…

…

Back in the courtyard, there was still some time before dark.

Zhou Qing cleaned the stone table under the big mulberry tree and opened the box. There were as many as ten sheets of parchment inside, worth one string of cash. If they were sold, they would be worth more.

Because parchment was usually unavailable even at a high price.

In the black market, ten sheets of parchment could sell for two strings of cash.

He neatly spread a sheet of parchment on the stone table and pressed down the four corners.

Zhou Qing touched it and smelled it, judging that it was mulberry bark paper made from mulberry bark, which could last for a thousand years without rotting. Monks often used it to copy scriptures, and calligraphers often used it to write their proud works.

As a graduate student in ancient Chinese language and literature, he had appreciated articles and calligraphy copied on mulberry bark paper in his tutor's house.

He had a deep impression of that calligraphy, the content of which was a copy of Zhuge Liang's "Admonition to His Son."

As for who copied it, he didn't know.

Zhou Qing recalled the past, and the words and sentences on the Admonition to His Son floated to his mind.

Seeing the mulberry bark paper in front of him, he couldn't help but feel itchy.

"Since I want to study and take the imperial examinations, I can't neglect my skills in writing and calligraphy."

Zhou Qing found a brush and ink, and first practiced calligraphy on straw paper to find his touch.

Then, he let the content of the Admonition to His Son flow through his mind. The articles of the sages, every word a gem, unconsciously, Zhou Qing felt a kind of inexplicable touch in his heart.

At a certain moment, his emotions erupted. He soaked the brush head with ink, and the tip of the brush fell on the paper:

"The conduct of a gentleman is to cultivate himself with tranquility and nourish his virtue with frugality. Without indifference, there is no way to clarify one's ambition; without tranquility, there is no way to achieve far-reaching goals... Years pass with time, and intentions fade with each day... Grieving over guarding a poor house, what will be the point!"

Zhou Qing's heart calmed down during the writing process.

Finally, he put down the brush and suddenly realized.

During this period of time, he had been very involved in cultivating the Tiger Play, and unconsciously developed a hidden ferocity.

In the process of writing, the ferocity was purified, with less impetuosity and more purity.

Accurately speaking, the ferocity was transformed into courage. He paid attention to the Nourishing Life Master again, and there was one more item:

Literary Courage (Beginner).

At the same time, he noticed that the content of the Tiger Play had also changed:

Tiger Play (Proficient).

He had actually naturally advanced the Tiger Play from proficient to expert without practicing the Tiger Play.

Zhou Qing focused his attention on "Literary Courage" again.

"It must be because of the effect of this Literary Courage."

Reading and writing could directly improve the progress of Tiger Play cultivation?

Zhou Qing seemed to have opened a door to a new world, and the road ahead became wider.
