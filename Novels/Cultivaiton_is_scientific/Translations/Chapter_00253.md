# Chapter 253: The Setup  

Li Shimin took out the Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Furnace. He wasn't planning to refine pills in large quantities—his real purpose was to buy time.  

Inside the furnace, he was refining the Foundation Establishment-stage "Shushan Hunwu Pills." He estimated that if any monks from the Thousand Leaves Temple were indeed tailing and monitoring him, they would likely come to investigate if he remained inactive for too long.  

He even kept the "One Leap Ten Thousand Miles Talisman" in his hand. Though this life-saving talisman was slightly slower than his "Step-by-Step Lotus" technique, it still served as a last resort.  

Outside, Venerable Zhiming waited for a full day and night. Something felt off. The area had no spiritual veins, and Li Shimin had merely dug a temporary cave dwelling. There wasn't much he could do here.  

Even if he were cultivating, he couldn’t possibly be consuming spirit pills continuously—every type of pill required digestion time.  

*Has Li Shimin discovered me and used an array to cover his escape?* Venerable Zhiming grew increasingly anxious.  

It wasn’t that he lacked patience, but this mission had been assigned by Venerable Huike. He couldn’t afford any mistakes.  

After several more hours, he could no longer sit still.  

Finally, gritting his teeth, he abandoned stealth and approached the cave’s defensive array. He sent a probing spell inside—a way to test the waters.  

This was a common practice among cultivators. If someone responded, he could explain it as a simple inquiry.  

But given his identity—especially after Venerable Huike’s recent attack on Li Shimin—any disturbance would raise suspicions.  

Yet, Venerable Zhiming had no choice. He had to confirm whether Li Shimin was still inside.  

After an incense stick’s worth of time without any response, his expression darkened.  

Without hesitation, he summoned his magic treasure and struck the array with full force.  

The array wasn’t particularly powerful—just a makeshift formation using second-grade materials, barely capable of withstanding attacks from Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

A single strike from a Golden Core cultivator like Venerable Zhiming shattered it instantly.  

As the array collapsed, a deafening explosion erupted from inside the cave. The smell of scorched materials mixed with the fragrance of medicinal herbs wafted out.  

"My pills!" Li Shimin’s furious roar followed.  

Venerable Zhiming had been over 80% certain Li Shimin had already left. That was why he dared to attack the array.  

But now, Li Shimin stormed out, his face twisting in shock and anger at the sight of the monk.  

"Thousand Leaves Temple—this isn’t over!" Li Shimin’s talisman flashed, and his figure blurred into a streak of light. His voice lingered in the air, but he was already gone.  

He had activated the "One Leap Ten Thousand Miles Talisman" without giving Venerable Zhiming a chance to explain.  

The monk stood frozen, realizing the gravity of the situation. That talisman was a priceless life-saving treasure, typically reserved for a Golden Core master’s most valued disciples.  

With Li Shimin forced to use such a trump card, no explanation would suffice.  

What Venerable Zhiming didn’t know was that this was all part of Li Shimin’s plan.  

Li Shimin had grown weary of the temple’s relentless pursuit. As a mere late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, he couldn’t guarantee his concealment techniques would always work against the temple’s Golden Core monks—or even their Nascent Soul elders.  

So instead of relying on his "Soul Veil Shadow Art," he set a trap. The cost? A single "One Leap Ten Thousand Miles Talisman" to cement the narrative that the Thousand Leaves Temple had attacked him—again.  

The talisman lived up to its name, propelling him nearly ten thousand miles in an instant—faster than most Golden Core cultivators could fly.  

Though effective, crafting such a talisman was incredibly demanding. The materials alone required third-grade ingredients.  

When the talisman’s effects faded, Li Shimin finally relaxed. The oppressive sense of being tracked—though imperceptible—had weighed on his mind. Now, he was free.  

He immediately reported the incident to the Shushan Sect, detailing how Venerable Zhiming had attacked his defensive array, forcing him to use the talisman to escape. He even included a recorded image of the scene.  

Leaving the sect to handle negotiations with the Thousand Leaves Temple, he then contacted Cai Hong using his guest alchemist token.  

"Daoist Li, it’s rare for you to reach out first!" Cai Hong’s cheerful voice came through.  

He assumed Li Shimin was expressing gratitude for the Northern Shu Trading Company’s recent assistance—when three Golden Core cultivators had been dispatched to help him.  

Li Shimin’s value lay in his ability to mass-produce high-quality pills—a feat even master alchemists struggled to match.  

His pills were in high demand precisely because each one was consistently top-tier. Even a slight improvement in efficacy, when accumulated over time, made a significant difference—especially for life-saving elixirs.  

"Manager Cai, I recall that when I signed the guest alchemist contract, I had the right to choose my clients, correct?" Li Shimin asked calmly.  

"Of course! The Northern Shu Trading Company would never interfere with your decisions regarding whom you refine pills for," Cai Hong replied, though puzzled.  

"Good. From now on, remove all Thousand Leaves Temple-related refining tasks from my list. If I find any, I’ll terminate my guest relationship with your company," Li Shimin stated flatly.  

"Daoist Li, may I ask why?" Cai Hong was taken aback.  

This was no small matter. Li Shimin’s alchemy skills were among the best among high-level alchemists. His output and quality were unmatched.  

All six major sects had placed large orders through the Northern Shu Trading Company, benefiting greatly.  

Now, Li Shimin was attempting to single-handedly boycott the Thousand Leaves Temple’s alchemy business.  

Though it seemed audacious, it was entirely within his rights. However, it would undoubtedly provoke the temple—a sect not known for its patience.  

Cai Hong wanted to mediate, hoping to prevent further escalation.  

"Ask the Thousand Leaves Temple what they did to me," Li Shimin said before cutting the connection.  

Within the temple, few—whether Venerable Zhiming, Venerable Huike, or other monks—understood Li Shimin’s significance.  

The temple’s alchemy outsourcing had been handled by Venerable Zhiyan, the overseer of their pill-refining hall.  

Over the past year, the temple had reaped immense benefits. The high-quality pills Li Shimin produced had significantly boosted their monks’ cultivation efficiency.  

When Venerable Zhiyan received the Northern Shu Trading Company’s notice—that Li Shimin would no longer accept tasks from the Thousand Leaves Temple—he panicked.  

His pill-refining hall had been stockpiling second-grade herbs for a new batch of pills.  

Without Li Shimin, they’d have to rely on their in-house alchemists, whose success rate for high-grade pills was barely 10%—and even those couldn’t match Li Shimin’s quality.  

Having tasted the difference, the temple’s monks would revolt if forced back to inferior pills.  

Venerable Zhiyan urgently reported the matter, demanding to know why Li Shimin had cut ties.  

The temple’s higher-ups were already reeling from the Shushan Sect’s furious condemnation.  

If the first attack on Li Shimin could be dismissed as a misunderstanding, the second one—forcing him to use a life-saving talisman—was undeniable aggression.  

This incident was straining relations between the two sects.  

After all, Grandmaster Fan had personally intervened last time. Now, barely days later, the temple had disrespected him by attacking Li Shimin again.  

Meanwhile, Li Shimin traveled through the night, his "Soul Veil Shadow Art" rendering him invisible. His "Step-by-Step Lotus" technique left no trace, allowing him to move like a ghost.  

By day, he continued using shadows to mask his movements.  

Within half a day, he reached the border checkpoint. Familiar with the defensive array’s flaws from before, he slipped through unnoticed into the buffer zone.  

There, he released his clone, Li Yuanba.  

The two exchanged a knowing smile and a bow before Li Yuanba transformed into a streak of sword light, heading for the mountain pass.  

With his clone safely returned to the Ten Thousand Mountains, Li Shimin finally relaxed.  

No matter what the Thousand Leaves Temple planned, Li Yuanba’s return meant they’d have far fewer opportunities to act against him.  

From now on, Li Yuanba would focus on cultivation, minimizing outings.  

Li Shimin re-entered the righteous faction’s territory, this time heading for the ruins of the Five Qi Sect.  

He continued his covert journey, blending "Soul Veil Shadow Art" with "Step-by-Step Lotus." This method was far stealthier than using a flying boat.  

Given the temple’s extensive intelligence network, overt travel would quickly draw their attention.  

---  

"Huike, I demand an explanation!" Grandmaster Fan’s voice was laced with fury as he contacted Venerable Huike.  

"Patron Fan, we meant no harm to young Daoist Li. We merely sought information about a Buddhist reincarnation," Venerable Huike replied carefully.  

"If the Thousand Leaves Temple had questions for Li Shimin, they could’ve gone through the Shushan Sect. Instead, you ambushed him twice—forcing him to expend a life-saving talisman. Is this how your sect operates?  

"Shall the Shushan Sect employ the same tactics against your monks?" Grandmaster Fan retorted.  

Venerable Huike now regretted his actions. He’d only just learned from Venerable Zhiyan about Li Shimin’s alchemical importance.  

Previously, second-grade pills and Foundation Establishment affairs hadn’t concerned him.  

But now, with Li Shimin boycotting the temple while supplying the other five sects, the implications were dire.  

Over time, the temple’s monks would fall behind in cultivation speed—a disparity that could prove disastrous in large-scale conflicts.  

Thus, resolving this matter became the temple’s top priority.  

Who would’ve thought a mere Foundation Establishment alchemist could wield such influence over a major sect like the Thousand Leaves Temple?  

Forced to concede, the temple had no choice but to make amends.
