# Chapter 143: Divine Sword Thunder Control Technique (Seeking Monthly Tickets)

The area within five or six miles of Jiangzhou's medicinal garden had long been designated as a restricted zone. At this moment, other disciples of the Dao Court in the city could sense the terrifying aura of the heavenly tribulation from afar and knew it was related to Master Zhou.

In the past, the Dao Court had no shortage of martial cultivators who weathered heavenly tribulations, but those events were completely incomparable to the oppressive aura now gathering in the sky.

The thunder tribulation clouds were densely concentrated, covering only about a mile in area, with the cloud layer hanging low.

The great mulberry tree's energy surged forth, releasing a stream of azure qi that formed a protective barrier above its canopy. The barrier pulsed with vitality, flowing like water.

Lin Wan'er watched from a distance, her heart pounding with nervousness. Having lived alongside the great mulberry tree for many years, she had developed deep affection for it.

Boom!

A brilliant bolt of lightning streaked down from the thunder clouds, tearing a massive, mysterious rift in the void. The lightning struck the azure barrier above the tree's canopy.

An intensely cold aura erupted from the lightning.

In an instant, the entire medicinal garden was affected, covered in frost and snow.

"The mortal realm's heavenly law is centered around the principle of frost, which manifests even in the great mulberry tree's tribulation," Zhou Qing mused silently.

He understood this was due to the mortal realm's heavenly law—vast amounts of frost spiritual energy had gathered to form the tribulation clouds. The mortal realm's nature was relatively singular in its attributes.

Forming a Golden Core was likely the limit of what the mortal realm could achieve.

Unlike the world where the Jingyang Dao Domain resided, which had a much higher ceiling.

Zhou Qing thought of his Five Elements Inner World. If his inner world continued to expand and eventually became a minor realm, it would likely be based on the five elemental origins.

Well, his inner world was currently only five zhang in size—nowhere near the scale of a minor realm. Such matters were still just dreams for now.

The only way Zhou Qing could expand his inner world at present was by breaking through to higher realms.

The great mulberry tree continuously released its essence energy, transforming it into a protective barrier to withstand the tribulation.

Many disciples of the Dao Court, while terrified, felt an indescribable awe. The great mulberry tree was merely Master Zhou's spirit plant, yet it could contend with such heavenly might. They couldn't even imagine what divine abilities Master Zhou, who had already reached the legendary Golden Core realm, might possess now.

"Master Zhou can achieve immortality," Feng Xiu thought with conviction.

From a distance, Fu Shan observed the great mulberry tree enduring the tribulation with both shock and admiration. He understood clearly that had the great mulberry tree fallen into demonic paths, it would have been utterly overwhelmed by the tribulation. But because of Zhou Qing's influence, the tree's yin energy had been balanced by his yang energy, purging all evil influences and allowing it to withstand the tribulation on its own.

Even so, it remained uncertain whether the great mulberry tree could fully survive the tribulation.

---

The power of the thunder tribulation grew increasingly intense, and the great mulberry tree's protective barrier began to falter.

Boom!

Another bolt of lightning, thick as a water column, came crashing down.

The great mulberry tree's barrier finally shattered, and its canopy visibly burst into flames.

This was the tree using its yin-contained-yang to resist the extreme cold of the tribulation.

The tribulation continued relentlessly.

The great mulberry tree burned continuously while visibly shrinking in size.

Bolts of lightning fell endlessly.

"No wonder wood-attribute spirit creatures advancing to Golden Core-level entities are so rare even in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Such relentless strikes would be unbearable for naturally cultivated wood-attribute spirits, let alone the great mulberry tree now," Zhou Qing assessed silently.

He could already sense the great mulberry tree's vitality draining at an alarming rate.

"Friend Mulberry Tree, let me help you," Zhou Qing murmured.

The great mulberry tree, initially lost in fear and confusion, immediately calmed upon hearing Zhou Qing's voice.

After all, it had encountered Zhou Qing shortly after gaining sentience—he was essentially its guiding mentor.

The Azure Bamboo Sword, unable to hold back any longer, shot into the sky with Zhou Qing's permission, intercepting the lightning.

Countless bolts struck the sword.

But now, not only was it a magic treasure, it had also absorbed materials from the Shattered Moon Blade with Zhou Qing's help.

Originally, the Shattered Moon Blade's materials would have taken the Azure Bamboo Sword an extremely long time to assimilate fully.

Yet under the torrent of lightning essence, this fusion process accelerated dramatically.

Moreover, driven by Zhou Qing's comprehension of the Divine Firmament True Method, vast amounts of Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder True Qi were generated.

The Azure Bamboo Sword helped the great mulberry tree withstand the remaining pressure.

As Zhou Qing's life-bound magic treasure, and having harmonized its energy with the great mulberry tree over the years, the tribulation recognized them as one entity.

Otherwise, external interference in the tribulation would have triggered an even more terrifying heavenly punishment.

The Divine Firmament True Method surged wildly within the Azure Bamboo Sword.

An ocean of Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder True Qi gathered.

Zhou Qing felt something shatter within his Nourishing Life Mastery.

Sword Dao: Divine Sword Thunder Control Technique (Sword Technique: Majestic Heavenly Might—'Beginner Level').

Countless insights into the sword path collided and merged, forming a complete sword technique.

Majestic heavenly might, guided by the sword!

All the Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder True Qi within the Azure Bamboo Sword erupted, coalescing into a colossal thunder sword that slashed toward the tribulation clouds in the void.

The terrifying tribulation clouds scattered under the overwhelming thunderous sword light.

This was also because the tribulation was nearing its end.

But this single sword strike left all witnesses of the tribulation in boundless awe.

---

In later generations, many versions of this event circulated.

The most widespread account claimed that Master Zhou, while resting under the great mulberry tree, grew impatient with the approaching thunder tribulation, drew his sword, and with a single slash, cleaved the tribulation clouds apart!

It was said this scene was personally witnessed and recorded by Elder Fu Song.

Although scholars from the Ancient Classics Academy verified that Elder Fu Song wasn't present at the time, no one believed them.

After all, Elder Fu Song's personal notes contained records of the event!

Would Elder Fu Song lie?

...

Nearby, the great mulberry tree had shrunk significantly, its body charred. But the life-giving energy following the tribulation began to manifest, signaling the tree's new transformation—a process that would naturally take time.

However, vast amounts of spiritual energy from the mortal realm converged toward the great mulberry tree, even benefiting the nearby Qingfu Palace. The entire Jiangzhou region became significantly richer in spiritual energy.

"The great mulberry tree's ability to gather spiritual energy has improved tremendously after this advancement," Zhou Qing noted as he absorbed the converging energy while observing his Nourishing Life Mastery.

The Divine Sword Thunder Control Technique, derived from the Divine Firmament True Method, utilized thunder essence to generate Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder True Qi. This qi could then cultivate Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder Divine Light, concealed within sword radiance.

The key to cultivation lay in collecting vast amounts of thunder essence during thunderstorms using a flying sword.

Outside of thunderstorm seasons, one could cultivate yin-yang dual energies as a foundation to generate Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder True Qi.

This was also how Patriarch Tianxuan had cultivated yin-yang divine light using the Divine Firmament True Method.

Unfortunately, the yin-yang dual energies from the Divine Firmament True Method weren't sufficiently pure.

Thus, Zhou Qing's current focus was on the Rooster of Dawn and Yuan Mingyue.

The Rooster of Dawn possessed supremely pure solar true qi.

In its previous life, it had followed Jingyang. Zhou Qing suspected Jingyang's achievement of the Yin-Yang Treasure Vessel Body was also related to the rooster—at least the yang aspect likely originated from it.

However, Zhou Qing planned to wait until Yuan Mingyue reached Foundation Establishment perfection before attempting yin-yang divine light. The purer and more potent the yin-yang dual energies, the better the results.

Moreover, the quality of yin-yang dual energies was somewhat tied to the host's cultivation level.

With his All-Seeing Eyes, Zhou Qing could easily observe the world's energy flows and predict thunderstorm seasons.

He could then gradually cultivate the Divine Sword Thunder Control Technique while simultaneously tempering the Azure Bamboo Sword. Thanks to the tribulation's assistance, the Shattered Moon Blade's materials had fully integrated into the sword.

The Shattered Moon Blade was originally a fragment of the Demonic Moon—a broken magic treasure piece—which was why Zhou Qing could refine it. Had it been the intact White Moon Wolf sacred artifact, Zhou Qing's current cultivation would have been insufficient for refinement.

---

Having absorbed the Shattered Moon Blade's materials, the Azure Bamboo Sword had grown stronger.

This advancement was thanks to the generous "gift" from the Greedy Wolf Saint.

The Azure Bamboo Sword resided within Zhou Qing's body, continuously tempered by the Green Sun Spirit Flame. The Golden Core-level flame subtly aided the sword's gradual evolution.

The Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace's Three Flavors True Fire was actually a fusion of Sky Fire, Wood Fire, and Stone Fire.

Currently, Zhou Qing's Green Sun Spirit Flame had absorbed Solar True Fire and vast amounts of wood-attribute essence from cultivating Liver Wood Thunder.

Thus, Wood Fire and Sky Fire were already complete.

Only Stone Fire remained missing.

Stone Fire required seeking in extreme yin earth-shattering locations, corresponding to Solar True Fire.

Zhou Qing had already instructed Tianxuan City to help locate such sites. However, he wasn't in a hurry—his current priority was perfecting his divine abilities and techniques.

Additionally, he needed to study the Divine Water Palace's map.

Ideally, he could enter the Divine Water Palace before the hundred-year deadline.

...

The Azure Bamboo Sword still retained considerable Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder True Qi, which Zhou Qing needed to further refine and harmonize with sword energy.

Thunder methods originated from the wood element, corresponding to the Thunder (震) and Wind (巽) trigrams in the Eight Trigrams.

When Zhou Qing cultivated the Deer Play technique years ago, it corresponded to the liver—a wood-attribute organ. This led to the Deer Play's movement techniques, later elevated to "Wind God Legs."

This was the wind attribute derived from the wood element's Wind trigram, hence the name—not arbitrarily chosen.

Thunder methods originated from the liver and passed through the heart.

Zhou Qing's Five Organs Thunder started with the heart fire before moving to liver wood—a reverse cultivation sequence.

This inversion was related to the Five Thunders Dissolution Hand.

The natural progression of wood-fire followed the five elements' generative cycle, consolidating essence, qi, and spirit.

The Five Thunders Dissolution Hand's principle reversed the five elements, dispersing the unified essence, qi, and spirit.

This was a divine ability to dissolve cultivators' or demonic creatures' cultivation.

Meanwhile, the reverse generation of the five elements started with wood and ended with earth. In the five directions, earth occupied the central position of virtue, unifying all elements.

Despite the reverse generation, the Five Organs Thunder ultimately merged through the spleen earth thunder.

Moreover, the Dao Furnace's formation relied on the perfect fusion of essence, qi, and spirit. For further refinement and impurity removal, the Dao Furnace needed reshaping and reintegration.

The reverse generation of the five elements aligned perfectly with this process.

During the reversal, the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace's impurities were also expelled.

The Supreme Unity Primal Chaos Divine Light unified the five elements.

---

Reintegrating the dispersion caused by the reverse generation led to Zhou Qing's Dao Furnace forming a Golden Core.

This marked the perfection of alchemy.

Forging the Dao Furnace was one milestone in Zhou Qing's cultivation path; forming the Golden Core was another.

Thunder methods could originate from the liver or kidneys. Kidney water thunder was yin thunder, corresponding to the Marsh (泽) trigram. Thus, kidney water thunder was insidiously toxic.

Cultivating yang thunder involved complex desires but could be restrained with great willpower. Cultivating yin thunder required a tranquil mind normally but left one vulnerable to external temptations, easily leading to demonic paths.

Zhou Qing's Five Organs Thunder began with heart fire thunder, embodying pure yang and following the orthodox path of longevity.

Additionally, the five elements' sword energy belonged to metal, originating from the lungs.

Lung metal could harm others, but Zhou Qing nourished it with the Azure Bamboo Sword's wood attribute, concealing its edge. This somewhat diminished its sharpness, yet wood generated thunder. Through the Divine Thunder Sword Control Technique's thunder attribute, the sword energy's power could be fully unleashed.

The residual Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder True Qi in the Azure Bamboo Sword was refined into Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder Divine Light, merging with the sword.

This divine light significantly enhanced the Divine Sword Thunder Control Technique's power.

...

White Moon Wolf Sacred Land.

"That brat actually refined the Shattered Moon Blade completely. Even with Tianxuan's help, it shouldn't have been possible," the Howling Moon Monster muttered, frowning beneath the Demon-Sealing Pillar.

Unfortunately, he had only managed to project a sliver of his spirit at the time—otherwise, he could have inflicted irreversible damage on Zhou Qing.

Now, it seemed he had nurtured a tiger to his own detriment.

"Ancestor, according to our intelligence, Tianxuan has likely fallen into deep slumber and can no longer act easily."

Howling Moon nodded. "No surprise. Without powerful artifacts to seal himself, Tianxuan's demise is imminent. He's humanity's last trump card—he might act once more at most. Currently, Qinglingzi poses a significant threat. Due to the Shattered Moon Blade, I'll need a century to break free fully. But I fear that brat might disrupt my plans if left unchecked. Given time, he could become a calamity on Tianxuan's level—or worse..."

Howling Moon's expression darkened.

Even now, the name "Jingyang" cast a long shadow over him. The seven characters carved on the Demon-Sealing Pillar—"Jingyang imprisoned Howling Moon here"—remained vividly etched, indelible.

White Moon said, "I've contacted the Black Eagle Demon King and the Ink Dragon King, explaining the stakes. However, they demand the secret of your advancement. If you agree, they're willing to collaborate on a plan to hunt Qinglingzi."

The Black Eagle Demon King and the Ink Dragon King were both late Golden Core-level beings. Combined with White Moon, three late Golden Core experts could rival even Patriarch Tianxuan.

However, this plan required luring Zhou Qing at least a thousand miles from Tianxuan City—the farther, the better. Golden Core-level battles near the city might awaken Tianxuan, who could then sacrifice himself to save Qinglingzi or take down one or two of them.

After all, Tianxuan was already on the brink of death.

"To advance into a peerless great demon, one requires the essence of a 'Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root.'"

"Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root?"

"Indeed, which is why I never told you—it would've been useless. A Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root must at least be a wood-attribute, Golden Core-level spirit creature. In ancient times, the Southern Barrens birthed a Green Emperor, a once-in-an-era genius among demons. Its true form was a green lotus. Many peerless great demons arose because of it. The Green Emperor nearly unified the Southern Barrens. Its realm far surpassed human Nascent Soul cultivators, but it mysteriously vanished, leading to our defeat against the ancient human sects' counterattack."

Howling Moon revealed these long-buried secrets before continuing:

"Truthfully, all humans and demons in the Southern Barrens seek the secret of immortality. Yet across countless ages, none have truly succeeded. Even the primordial gods and demons, born from the world's creation and said to be undying, ultimately perished. Some demons and a few humans carry traces of their bloodlines. The primordial gods and demons were divided into ancient gods and ancient demons, born from the pure and turbid energies of creation. They possessed near-limitless lifespans but still faded away.

By the ancient era, human cultivators and demons began a new cycle of conflict. Initially, human body refiners flourished, extracting god-demon bloodlines to achieve physiques surpassing even ours. Yet their lifespans remained shorter than demons'. Through endless struggle, human qi cultivators rose, eventually replacing body refiners as humanity's mainstream after internal strife.

As the world changed, qi cultivators initially incorporated body refinement, but this grew increasingly difficult. Pure qi cultivation became dominant—today's qi refiners.

Jingyang was an anomaly, seemingly forging a path merging ancient and modern methods, achieving the 'Yin-Yang Treasure Vessel Body' with unparalleled accomplishments in both qi and body refinement. Even in ancient times, such a figure would've been a prodigy.

Humanity's cultivation methods have progressed overall. Modern techniques, divine abilities, and artifacts would surpass ancient cultivators' in their own era. Ancient humans excelled in comprehending the Dao, but their techniques paled in comparison. However, today's world makes Dao comprehension far harder.

Moreover, humanity faces tribulations far more terrifying than ours.

They've suffered multiple near-extinctions yet always rebounded. Even I must admit humans are formidable foes. Given the chance, they must be eradicated completely—otherwise, their resurgence spells doom for demonkind."

Howling Moon spoke with palpable dread.

Having lived through eras predating Jingyang—including a golden age of Southern Barrens humanity—he'd witnessed countless mighty demons fall to human hands.

During humanity's declines, they became prey for demons. But during their rises, entire demonic races faced annihilation.

This deep-seated fear and hatred were why demonic beasts went berserk during beast tides—their blood and bones remembered.

In the Southern Barrens, weak creatures were born silently, while stronger ones made louder arrivals.

For instance, Sunflare Tiger cubs emitted low roars at birth.

Humans were even louder, wailing without fear of attracting predators.

This instinctive crying was ingrained in their bloodline—a testament to their past dominance.

Currently, humanity was weak. But Howling Moon knew their resurgence meant extinction for many demons.

In ancient times, Golden Core-level demons didn't assume human forms.

But humanity's overwhelming strength forced them to disguise themselves, even infiltrating human societies to learn cultivation methods.

This was why many modern Golden Core demons could shapeshift instinctively.

However, wood-attribute demons found shapeshifting exceptionally difficult. Howling Moon had only heard of the Green Emperor succeeding.

A mere Golden Core wood spirit was far from achieving such a feat.

In both human and demon legends, after the primordial gods' fall, immortality became the ultimate pursuit.

Immortals were said to rival heaven and earth in longevity, transcending life and death.

Yet "immortality" remained mythical—no verified cases existed.

As for how to achieve it, Howling Moon had heard one theory: unifying the Southern Barrens and harnessing its fortune might birth the land's first immortal—the Southern Barrens' Immortal Progenitor!

This was why the Green Emperor sought unification.

As for what lay beyond the Southern Barrens, no records existed.

The Barrens alone seemed boundless. The Jingyang Dao Domain, cleansed by Jingyang, was a rare haven. Beyond it lay countless dangers even Howling Moon dared not probe—primordial god-demon battlefields, ancient sect ruins, forbidden demonic zones...

Missteps meant certain death.

As for why it was called the Southern Barrens, the name dated back to the primordial era.

Having explained the secret of advancing to peerless demonhood—which was essentially no secret—White Moon gained deeper insight into humanity's threat.

Fragmented records existed among the White Moon, Black Eagle, and Ink Dragon tribes. Howling Moon's words reinforced the major demons' consensus against human resurgence.

Many had lived through Jingyang's era and understood the devastation such figures wrought.

Given enough numbers, humans could produce numerous Foundation Establishment cultivators in decades, even Golden Core elders. With sufficient population and stability, Nascent Soul monsters might emerge within centuries.

Even after Jingyang, humanity's repeated declines still birthed threats like Tianxuan.

Thus, while competing amongst themselves, the major demons tacitly agreed to prevent human resurgence.

White Moon would spare no effort rallying the two late Golden Core demons to hunt Qinglingzi.

The key was luring him at least a thousand miles from Tianxuan City—the farther, the better. This required human traitors' cooperation.

Fortunately, humans were prone to infighting.

White Moon began scouting suitable candidates.
