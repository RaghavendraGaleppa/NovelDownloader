# Chapter 49: The Matter of Promotion

On his way back from the outer sect to his courtyard, Chu Ning pondered the news he had heard from Mu Ling.

According to Mu Ling, she had learned from a senior in the sect that the Qingxi Sect would expand its training efforts for labor disciples. Originally, skills like talisman-making, alchemy, and artifact forging were only taught to inner and outer sect disciples. However, after this season, labor disciples would have the opportunity to learn some basic crafting techniques.

Yet, Mu Ling also mentioned that even for labor disciples, the opportunities would be limited, given the sheer number of them in the Qingxi Sect. For example, labor disciples in the Spirit Plantation Division, who practiced wood-attribute techniques, would naturally be more suited to talisman-making. However, disciples in the Ding District would have little chance to compete, while those in the Bing District might have an opportunity.

"It seems I still need to find a way to get promoted to the Bing District," Chu Ning thought to himself.

In fact, Chu Ning already met the hard requirements for promotion to the Bing District, such as reaching the mid-stage of Qi Refinement and being able to cast certain planting spells instantly. However, meeting these conditions didn’t guarantee promotion. The Qingxi Sect conducted promotions once a year, and the number of spots was extremely limited. Only by outperforming others in the assessment could one secure a spot.

As for the timing of the promotion assessment, Chu Ning knew it would take place in three months. The spirit field he had been assigned to after his initial assessment three months after joining the sect had originally belonged to a disciple who had been promoted.

"I was planning to keep a low profile and develop steadily, but it seems I’ll have to compete for certain things now," Chu Ning thought, his expression turning serious as he entered his courtyard.

This time, he wouldn’t be competing against newcomers like Yuan Guang but against all labor disciples in the Ding District, including many senior disciples who had been in the sect for years. As a new disciple participating in the promotion assessment, regardless of whether he succeeded, he would inevitably draw some attention.

But Chu Ning couldn’t afford to worry too much about that. A labor disciple reaching the fourth level of Qi Refinement within a few months wasn’t unheard of. As for his spellcasting abilities, he could use his previous explanation. Once he entered the Bing District and kept a low profile for a while, people would gradually forget about him. Missing this opportunity, however, would mean it might never come again.

Having made up his mind, Chu Ning decided without hesitation to participate in the promotion assessment three months later.

Over the next few days, Chu Ning spent his time tending to the fields and cultivating, with nothing out of the ordinary happening.

One evening, as he returned from the fields, he was surprised to find the gate of the courtyard next to his—where Qi Chongmao had lived—wide open.

Chu Ning’s heart skipped a beat. "Could someone be investigating Qi Chongmao’s disappearance again?"

Zhuang Yunde had clearly stated that the sect wouldn’t investigate the disappearance of a mere labor disciple in depth. The Enforcement Hall had already conducted an investigation ten days ago. Why would they come back now?

With these thoughts in mind, Chu Ning unconsciously slowed his steps. Just then, he faintly heard voices from the courtyard, and it seemed someone was about to come out.

Without further hesitation, Chu Ning pushed open his own courtyard gate with a calm expression, pretending to head inside.

"Junior Brother, wait a moment!"

Just as Chu Ning stepped into his courtyard, a voice called out from behind, making him pause.

Turning around, he saw a man and a woman emerging from Qi Chongmao’s former courtyard. The man was of average build, around forty years old, with thick eyebrows and large eyes, giving off a somewhat simple and honest vibe. The woman appeared younger, and though not stunningly beautiful, she was quite attractive.

With a quick assessment, Chu Ning sensed that both had stronger spiritual energy fluctuations than him—they were at the sixth level of Qi Refinement.

"Junior Brother, my wife and I have just been assigned to live here by the sect. We’ll be neighbors from now on," the man said.

Chu Ning was slightly surprised. He hadn’t expected the sect to assign new occupants to Qi Chongmao’s courtyard so soon—and a married couple at that. While he had occasionally seen female disciples in the Ding District, this was the first time he’d encountered a married couple.

Before he could respond, the woman spoke up, "You didn’t even introduce yourself properly. How is he supposed to know who you are?"

The man chuckled sheepishly, while the woman turned to Chu Ning with a smile. "Junior Brother, I’m Lu Yunfang, and this is my husband, Luo Hongping. We’ve just returned from outside and were assigned to this courtyard."

Chu Ning cupped his hands in greeting. "Chu Ning greets Senior Brother and Senior Sister." Then, with some curiosity, he asked, "Senior Sister mentioned you just returned from outside?"

"Yes, we were previously stationed at a cultivation family’s spirit fields..." Lu Yunfang explained.

Through her account, Chu Ning gradually understood the situation. The couple had been managing spirit fields for a cultivation family under the sect’s jurisdiction. The family had many fields but few cultivators, so Luo Hongping and his wife had been stationed there for years. Recently, the family had produced a few new cultivators, and with Qi Chongmao’s disappearance leaving his fields unattended, the couple had been recalled to the sect.

Lu Yunfang smiled and added, "We just wanted to introduce ourselves as neighbors."

Chu Ning didn’t engage much further, politely maintaining a reserved demeanor as he saw them off. Despite the couple’s friendly attitude, his experience with Qi Chongmao had made him cautious. Not everyone who seemed kind was harmless.

After lighting the stove and cooking a meal, Chu Ning ate a large bowl of spirit rice. As the faint spiritual energy circulated through his body, he began his cultivation routine.

As usual, he first practiced the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, followed by the Evergreen Wood Technique, and finally the Soul Refinement Art. In his Mud Pill Palace, his divine sense remained in a swirling mist, not yet condensed into liquid, meaning he still couldn’t use it for sensing. Undeterred, he continued practicing according to the Soul Refinement Art’s口诀.

By the time he finished his cultivation, it was already deep into the night. Chu Ning returned to his room and lay down to sleep. After a moment’s thought, he took out a few items from his storage bag and placed them beside his pillow—an offensive talisman, a defensive talisman, and his mysterious black wooden sword. These were all within easy reach.

Since the incident with Qi Chongmao, Chu Ning had grown increasingly cautious, even within the sect. Especially now that new neighbors had moved in next door.
