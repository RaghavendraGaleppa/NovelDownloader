# Chapter 45: Wealth and Power

In the sight of the crowd...

Pale, ghostly figures densely packed like demons surged through the streets and alleys, leaping, running, and crawling with astonishing speed, converging towards Zhang Jing and his companions from all directions.

"Senior brothers and sister, these are ghost-skin puppets, controlled by the demon 'Lord Yin' of Heishan County," Zhang Jing quickly explained. "This dense fog is also its doing."

"Haha, junior brother, you actually managed to uncover the hidden demon in Heishan County. You'll get first credit for this mission!" Senior Brother Ding laughed heartily.

With that, the bamboo staff in his hand flew out, glowing with emerald light as it swept straight through the horde of ghost-skin puppets.

For a moment...

The air was filled with continuous, agonized wails as countless ghost-skin puppets turned to ashes, leaving behind only dried, tattered human skins.

"Tong Yao, you protect Junior Brother Zhang. We'll go help," Senior Brothers Zhou and Xia said simultaneously, immediately activating their magical artifacts to attack the surrounding ghost-skin puppets.

Though numerous, these ghost-skin puppets were extremely weak.

Seeing his senior brothers enthusiastically engaged in battle, Zhang Jing chose not to intervene. Instead, while Senior Sister Tong was fully focused on the front, he quietly replenished the expended spells in his Five Methods Spirit River.

These ghost-skin puppets were merely appetizers—the real demon had yet to appear.

Meanwhile, beneath Heishan County...

In a vast underground hall, a massive black tiger, standing eight zhang tall, sat on a giant chair in a human-like posture. Its front paws supported its huge tiger head, while its hind legs were crossed like a human's. Its whip-like tail slammed against the ground, scattering rubble.

The black tiger's eyes were half-closed as it occasionally growled in a hoarse voice, "Push faster, you lazy wretches! Useless in life, and just as useless as ghost-skin puppets in death. Truly disappointing."

Following its gaze...

At the center of the hall was a three-zhang-wide pool. In its middle stood a massive crimson millstone, which dozens of pale-faced ghost-skin puppets struggled to turn. Another hundred or so puppets stood in line, vomiting fresh flesh still attached to white bones into the millstone.

As the millstone turned...

Thick, mercury-like crimson liquid dripped continuously into the pool below, creating ripples. At the same time, wisps of pure mist rose from the pool and were immediately sucked into a white jade bottle placed beside it.

Whoosh—

A strange demonic wind blew.

The black tiger descended from its chair, thrusting its ferocious head into the pool and taking a deep breath. Its tiger eyes instantly revealed satisfaction.

"Good stuff, truly good stuff. Pity I have to give half of it away. If only it were all mine..."

Suddenly, the black tiger closed its eyes, as if sensing something. The next moment, a trace of suspicion flashed in its gaze.

"Why have so many ghost-skin puppets died? Did the Dao Academy send people? That can't be! I've already eaten all the demons in Heishan County. Did those three humans mess up their act? Otherwise, why would the peaceful Heishan County attract the Dao Academy's attention?"

"Useless, all useless! I knew humans were only good for filling my belly—nothing else! Roar—"

A frustrated tiger's roar echoed through the hall.

"No, no, no! Minions, get moving! Pack up all of my belongings!"

With that command...

The black tiger plunged its head into the pool again, sucking up half of the crimson liquid in one breath. Then, opening its maw, it spat out a storage bag, collecting the crimson millstone, the remaining liquid, and the white jade bottle.

On the other side...

All the ghost-skin puppets had been slain.

Senior Brother Ding turned to Zhang Jing and asked, "Junior Brother Zhang, do you know where the demon is now?"

"From what those three rogue cultivators said, it should be in the underground palace beneath the county. As for the entrance, follow me, senior brother."

Recalling the words of the man with the black mole, Zhang Jing soared into the air, swiftly heading east.

Soon...

Amidst the ruins of the city wall, Zhang Jing pointed to a stone gate below and said with concern, "Senior Brother Ding, this is one of the entrances to the underground palace. But I heard the demon is at the peak of the fourth level of Qi Refining. Wouldn't it be too risky for us to go in like this?"

Before he finished speaking, Senior Brother Xia chuckled and replied, "Junior brother, Senior Brother Ding is incredibly strong! Don't worry."

"Junior Brother Zhang, you said this is one of the entrances. Do you know where the others are?" Senior Brother Ding asked solemnly.

Zhang Jing shook his head. "Senior brother, those three rogue cultivators didn't know either."

"After killing so many ghost-skin puppets, the demon underground must have noticed. We're short on manpower, and we don't know the exits. Our only option is to strike now before it fully reacts—go down and slay it!"

Senior Brother Liu pushed open the stone gate and strode in first.

"Stay close behind me, and don't wander too far. Also, keep an eye on Junior Brother Zhang."

"Understood, senior brother!"

The winding passage descended endlessly, with branching paths veiled in spiderwebs. Every ten zhang or so, glowing night pearls were embedded in the ceiling, but the thickening fog limited their light to small patches.

Senior Brother Ding led the way.

Zhang Jing and the other three followed closely, swiftly moving down the main passage.

As they walked...

Zhang Jing suddenly noticed the dense fog swirling violently, as if something was approaching.

Before he could warn them...

Roar! A deafening roar erupted.

A massive tiger, its form obscured by the fog, leaped out from a side passage, lunging ferociously at Senior Brother Ding.

A chilling aura of killing intent spread.

Clang!

At the critical moment...

The emerald bamboo staff erupted with intense spiritual energy, intercepting the attack. Simultaneously, a protective barrier enveloped Senior Brother Ding, with a rotating shield reinforcing it.

Boom—

The colossal tiger collided with the bamboo staff, producing a dull thud before both were sent flying.

The tiger let out a pained howl before vanishing back into the fog.

Due to the narrow passage and the brief exchange, Zhang Jing, surrounded by his Five Methods Spirit River, barely had time to react before the tiger disappeared. He awkwardly lowered his hand.

Senior Brother Ding examined his bamboo staff, its glow noticeably dimmed.

"A fourth-level Qi Refining tiger demon—this must be the one!"

Turning to the others, he said urgently, "Junior brothers and sister, stay close."

A surge of spiritual energy erupted from him, and his speed increased severalfold.

In the great hall...

Violent spiritual fluctuations swept outward, accompanied by the relentless clashing of metal and the tiger's savage roars, reverberating through the underground palace.

The intense battle made the entire structure tremble, as if on the verge of collapse.

"The commotion is up ahead! Senior Brother Ding must be fighting the demon. Hurry, let's help!" Senior Sister Tong exclaimed anxiously after sensing the disturbance.

Given their past experiences with Senior Brother Ding, an ordinary fourth-level Qi Refining demon shouldn't have posed such a challenge. Yet, judging by the commotion, the battle was far from easy.

"Let's go!"

Senior Brother Xia, standing behind Zhang Jing, agreed.

"Junior brother, I might not be able to protect you later. Be careful," Senior Brother Zhou reminded Zhang Jing with a smile.

"Understood, senior brother."

Zhang Jing nodded.

But ahead, Senior Sister Tong had already summoned her artifact and rushed forward, with Senior Brothers Zhou and Xia close behind.

"Wait for me!"

Caught off guard, Zhang Jing hastily took out his Water Cloud Shield and followed.

Soon...

The four emerged from a small doorway into a vast space.

The sight of Senior Brother Ding locked in combat with a giant black tiger greeted them.

"Senior Brother Ding, we're here to help!" Senior Sister Tong shouted, charging forward with her artifact.

But before she could advance, a pitch-black spell streaked through the air, exploding violently and sending her flying.

Senior Brother Ding's voice rang out, "All of you, retreat the way you came! This beast has broken through to the fifth level of Qi Refining mid-battle. You can't interfere in this fight."

"What about you, senior brother?" Senior Brother Zhou called back.

"It just broke through—it can't defeat me, but I can't defeat it quickly either. Go now! I'll meet you above."

"Hahaha! Leave? I say you all stay! Look at that tender flesh..."

The black tiger swatted Senior Brother Ding's bamboo staff aside and lunged toward the four, covering dozens of zhang in a single bound.

An overwhelming, suffocating killing intent filled the air.

Before them, Senior Sister Tong and the two senior brothers froze, as if paralyzed by terror.

At that moment...

Zhang Jing, standing at the back, looked up. His dark pupils reflected the image of the leaping black tiger—he could even see the foul drool dripping from its maw.

"You like jumping, huh? Let's see if your corpse can make up for my losses."

Swoosh—

The Five Methods Spirit River surged.

Three pitch-black, dragon-like spell-fish leaped from the river, transforming into three dark, chilling blades imbued with terrifying killing intent.

At the same time...

A stack of thirty Solar Blaze Talismans appeared in Zhang Jing's hand, activated simultaneously, radiating an aura of extreme danger.

A barrage of talismans and three Ice Blade spells, enhanced by the Void-Devouring Serpent Dao Rhyme, erupted before the black tiger's horrified eyes.

Boom—

A miniature sun seemed to ignite.

The charging tiger was blasted backward faster than it had come.

The scent of charred flesh filled the air.
