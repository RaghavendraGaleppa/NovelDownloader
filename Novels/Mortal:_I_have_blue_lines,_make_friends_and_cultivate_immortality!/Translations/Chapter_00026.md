# Chapter 26: Lin Yun: "Qiaoqian, I'm Feeling Very Agitated Right Now!"

Ten days later, Lin Yun and his group arrived at Yellow Maple Valley.

Yellow Maple Valley was located in the Taiyue Mountain Range of Jianzhou. Jianzhou, situated in the northern part of the Yue Kingdom, ranked second in size among its thirteen provinces. The region was mostly covered with mountains and hills, sparsely populated, and bordered the neighboring Yuanwu Kingdom.

The Taiyue Mountain Range stretched continuously for thousands of miles in western Jianzhou. Not only was it home to countless wild beasts and birds of prey in its pristine, rarely traversed forests, but there were also occasional rumors from woodcutters and hunters claiming to have seen immortals or demons, adding a layer of mystery to the area.

Ordinary people would never guess that the central part of this mountain range had been occupied by Yellow Maple Valley, one of the seven major cultivation sects, for thousands of years.

From above, this area appeared no different from other mountain ranges—rugged peaks and lush forests. But in reality, it was all an illusion created by an enormous mystical formation. Beneath this facade stood countless pavilions and grand halls, with cultivators flying about on leaf-shaped magical instruments, busily going about their tasks.

"Hmph!"

"What an overconfident little girl!"

As they disembarked from the Taiyue Flying Boat, Chen Qiaoqian flicked her hair with refreshed vigor and patted her fully satisfied stomach. "I've beaten you by far!"

Without paying any further attention to Dong Xuan'er, she strode off like a victorious swan, her long, jade-like neck held high.

Dong Xuan'er was utterly confused. Had Chen Qiaoqian gone mad? Had she been driven to insanity by her?

Meanwhile, Han Li and Lin Yun were about to part ways.

As a specially recruited disciple of Yellow Maple Valley, and with the backing of the Chen family—one of the valley's three great clans—Lin Yun naturally wouldn't receive the same treatment as Han Li, a pseudo-spiritual root rogue cultivator who had barely entered the sect through the "Immortal Ascension Token."

Lin Yun patted Han Li on the shoulder and spoke earnestly, "Xiao Li, once you call me 'brother,' you're my brother for life. If you run into any trouble in Yellow Maple Valley, remember to come find me. I'll have your back!"

Han Li nodded gratefully. "Brother Lin, I'll never forget your kindness. Take care of yourself too."

With that, he left with Elder Wang.

Watching Han Li's retreating figure, Lin Yun also stepped off the Taiyue Flying Boat. He couldn't help but feel reluctant to part with his golden goose.

Due to the Immortal Ascension Token, Yellow Maple Valley was temporarily unsure how to handle Han Li, so they simply assigned him to the Guest Reception Pavilion.

Lin Yun, on the other hand, was taken away by the Talisman Hall of Yellow Maple Valley.

The head of the Talisman Hall was an old man called "Elder Fu," who had reached the peak of Foundation Establishment—False Core stage—and was already 180 years old.

When he first saw Lin Yun, his wrinkled face was stern and unyielding.

However, after Lin Yun effortlessly drew two high-grade primary talismans in front of him, Elder Fu's deeply lined face suddenly blossomed like a chrysanthemum.

"Marvelous!"

"Absolutely marvelous!"

"A genius!"

"Young man, you're truly a talisman genius!"

"Hahaha—"

"Lin Yun, from today onward, you are the deputy hall master of the Talisman Hall!"

"With your talent, you'll become an intermediate talisman master in no time!"

The speed at which Elder Fu's attitude changed left even Lin Yun speechless.

That night, Lin Yun settled into the quarters prepared for him by the Talisman Hall.

"Brother Lin, are you resting?"

Just as he had lain down, he suddenly received a message talisman from Chen Qiaoqian. Lin Yun sighed in exasperation.

"Senior Sister Chen, what are you doing~!"

Outside Lin Yun's room, Chen Qiaoqian waited eagerly. Using the Chen family's influence, she had easily found out where he was staying.

"Ah!" Lin Yun glanced at his waist and sighed. "Tonight is going to be another battlefield. I really need to start practicing body-refining techniques soon."

"Brother Lin..." Seeing him open the door, Chen Qiaoqian gazed at him with tender affection, her body squirming slightly with restless desire before she shyly lowered her head.

"Brother Lin, I—"

"Come inside with me!" Lin Yun pulled her into the room.

Though Chen Qiaoqian's wrist ached from the rough handling, a strange excitement surged in her heart. She found herself anticipating more.

"Brother Lin, be gentle... Don't be so rough," she whispered with a hint of anticipation. "But... if you insist, Qiaoqian won't refuse you."

She closed her eyes, her long lashes trembling slightly, her lips parting slightly.

"Qiaoqian, have you forgotten what I told you before?" Instead of the storm she expected, Lin Yun spoke sternly. "You seem to be getting addicted to this!"

His words startled her. She opened her eyes in panic. "Brother Lin, no—that's not it! Qiaoqian hasn't forgotten about cultivation! It's just—just—"

Under Lin Yun's piercing gaze, she lowered her head in shame, feeling utterly humiliated. "I'm sorry, Brother Lin."

"Ah..." Seeing her like this, Lin Yun sighed, his stern expression melting away like winter snow, replaced by boundless gentleness.

He reached out and caressed Chen Qiaoqian's cheek before pulling her into his arms.

Chen Qiaoqian trembled in his embrace like a frightened little bird.

"Qiaoqian, don't blame me for being harsh. It's just that we shouldn't let momentary pleasures hinder our path of cultivation."

"We're both still young. We should aim for higher realms of power."

"Think about it—if we both reach Core Formation or even Nascent Soul stage, we'll have hundreds, even thousands of years together."

"So, do you understand?"

"Don't sacrifice our greater happiness for fleeting indulgence."

"Mmm." Chen Qiaoqian nodded obediently, finding his words reasonable.

*She really falls for this kind of talk,* Lin Yun thought. *Well, this is one of her good points. Otherwise, I wouldn't have chosen her first.*

Chen Qiaoqian was easy to read—once she liked someone, she wanted to be with them always, willing to give everything for them. Her emotions were pure and intense.

"Brother Lin... but Qiaoqian just can't help missing you," she murmured against his chest, her fingers tracing circles on him.

Feeling the restless body in his arms and her barely contained longing, Lin Yun issued a command.

"Kneel."

Chen Qiaoqian looked up at him. The gentleness in his face was gone, replaced by an unyielding gaze.

A mix of grievance, anticipation, and excitement stirred within her.

She loved this domineering, ruthless side of Lin Yun just as much!

What could she do?

She could only submit and obey.
