# Chapter 38: Selling  

"Old Liu, why has the spirit rice gotten more expensive again? Two spirit stones per jin—might as well rob people outright!" A loud voice shattered the quiet atmosphere of the market.  

Li Shiming turned toward the source of the noise—a stall two spots away. Hearing the mention of spirit rice, he moved closer but stopped about five meters away, not getting too near. The other onlookers did the same, keeping their distance. Some even turned and walked away upon hearing the argument.  

Li Shiming noticed the wooden sign on the stall bearing the character "Liu."  

"Spirit plant seeds!" His eyes lit up when he saw the items on display.  

Currently, the only spirit plant seeds he had were for spirit rice. Growing just that alone would provide him with enough rice. However, the space in his machine room was extremely limited, and all the available space was already dedicated to cultivating spirit rice. If he could find higher-value spirit plants, he could significantly increase his profits.  

But for now, another cultivator was negotiating with the stall owner, so he couldn't approach yet.  

"Go rob someone else then! This is the price—take it or leave it!" Old Liu, the stall owner, raised his eyebrows dismissively.  

"Wasn't it one and a half spirit stones per jin just a while ago?" The complaining cultivator grumbled, but spirit rice was a necessity, so he had to buy it anyway. He knew this market was the only one nearby, and the Liu family—Old Liu's clan—was the sole producer of spirit rice in the area.  

"The two-spirit-stone price is only because we managed to eradicate a spirit insect swarm in time. Otherwise, forget two spirit stones—there might not even be any extra rice to sell!" Old Liu said helplessly.  

On the surface, being a spirit farmer seemed lucrative—just buy some seeds, plant them in a spirit field, and wait for the harvest. But in reality, spirit farming came with many challenges, as Li Shiming had read in *The Basics of Spirit Farming* and Shi Ximing's cultivation notes.  

Spirit fields were highly attractive to spirit insects that fed on rice. Some of these pests could even bypass defensive formations by burrowing through the soil, wreaking havoc on the crops.  

Most loose cultivator clans lacked powerful defensive formations, making them more vulnerable to insect infestations. The worst was encountering a spirit insect swarm—a sudden explosion in the insect population that launched a full-scale assault on the fields.  

Normally, spirit insects would sneak in and cause minor damage. But during a swarm, countless insects would recklessly charge the fields. If the defenses held, only part of the crop would be lost. If not, the entire field—and even the spirit soil itself—could be ruined.  

Of course, Li Shiming had no such worries when growing spirit rice in his machine room.  

"Fine, I'll take ten jin," the cultivator said reluctantly, pulling out a cloth pouch from his waist and counting out twenty spirit stones.  

The man looked pained, clearly not swimming in wealth.  

Li Shiming noticed that the cultivator hadn't retrieved the stones from a storage pouch—just an ordinary bag.  

Sure enough, after receiving the ten jin of spirit rice from Old Liu, the man carried it away in his hands.  

"First time here, friend? I, Old Liu, am known in Zhongdu Market for my fairness—never cheated young or old! The spirit rice I sell is the best within a thousand li!" Old Liu turned to Li Shiming with a smile.  

"Old Liu, within a thousand li, you're the only one selling spirit rice anyway!" a nearby stall owner chimed in.  

The surrounding cultivators who knew Old Liu burst into laughter.  

Listening to their banter, Li Shiming realized that when it came to haggling, cultivators weren't much different from ordinary people.  

"Fellow Daoist Liu, what kinds of spirit seeds do you have here?" Li Shiming asked, lowering his voice.  

Old Liu gave him a once-over, surprised that he was asking about seeds.  

After all, growing spirit seeds required a spirit farmer. As the other stall owner had said, the Liu family was the only one in the area with spirit farmers and fields. The seeds on his stall were mostly for show—otherwise, having only spirit rice would make his stall look too plain.  

"I've got Emerald Grass seeds—favorite food of herbivorous spirit beasts. Then there's Earth Ginseng seeds, and Three-Leaf Orchid seeds," Old Liu explained, pointing at each type.  

Li Shiming shook his head inwardly. Emerald Grass was even less valuable than spirit rice. As for Earth Ginseng and Three-Leaf Orchid, he only knew how to cultivate Earth Ginseng.  

But even if he grew Earth Ginseng, who would he sell it to?  

This market was tiny. Though he hadn't explored every corner, he already had a rough idea of what was available.  

Only six stalls had proper tables—these were the permanent ones. The rest were just cultivators selling their unwanted items.  

Perhaps these items weren't worth selling to the permanent stalls, or maybe the stalls simply wouldn't buy them.  

Either way, the variety of goods here was pitifully small. Li Shiming decided against buying Earth Ginseng seeds—it wasn't worth the effort to research cultivation methods for something that might not even sell, especially if it interfered with his spirit rice production.  

He had hoped to find higher-grade spirit herb seeds here, but reality had dashed those expectations.  

"Fellow Daoist Liu, do you buy spirit rice?" Li Shiming asked after some thought.  

Since he wasn't buying seeds, he might as well sell some rice to earn more spirit stones for other purchases.  

"Of course I buy spirit rice! One spirit stone per jin—I'll take as much as you've got!" Old Liu replied in a hushed tone.  

Li Shiming simply stared at him without speaking.  

Old Liu's face reddened slightly, realizing his earlier customer's loud complaint had probably been overheard.  

"Friend, you must understand—the cost of importing rice from afar is already one spirit stone per jin. I'm not lowballing you!" Old Liu spread his hands in explanation.  

"One hundred jin of spirit rice for one hundred twenty spirit stones. Deal now," Li Shiming said softly.  

"Since you've said so, I'll give you face this time. Remember Old Liu if you have more rice to sell in the future!" Old Liu didn't push back. At this price, he could still turn a profit. He also worried that if Li Shiming set up his own stall, it might drive rice prices down.  

Li Shiming touched his waist, producing a cloth pouch, which he placed on the table.  

Old Liu opened it, channeled a wisp of spiritual energy inside, and quickly assessed the rice's quality. His smile widened.  

"Here are one hundred twenty spirit stones. Please count them," he said, placing a small bag on the table.  

Though Li Shiming lacked Old Liu's expertise, spirit stones were easy to verify with a touch. His hand swept over the bag briefly before he nodded and stored it away.  

The transaction was swift, but several onlookers had still noticed.
