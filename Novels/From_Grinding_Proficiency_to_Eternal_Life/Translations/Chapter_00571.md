# Chapter 571: He Is a True Disciple of the Primordial Sect

The one facing him was wreathed in starlight, his divine will as profound as the boundless cosmic void. He cultivated the wondrous Dao of the Clear Qi of Heaven and Earth, and every movement drew upon the immense Dao laws of the Taihua Void Realm. He was none other than the Lord of the Clear Source of the Primordial Sect.

The clash between these two supreme beings, held back nothing. The mere shockwaves made the entire space groan in agony.

"You fiends dare to invade my Celestial Palace? You deserve to be executed!"

The Heavenly Emperor's voice was majestic and vast, echoing throughout the cosmos. He mobilized the laws of the entire world to suppress the Lord of the Clear Source.

The Lord of the Clear Source let out a cold snort, a sound like a primordial thunderclap that shattered the heavens, showing no fear. "A frog in a well dares to speak of executing immortals? You fail to recognize the will of Heaven and are destined to be turned to dust!"

With a light tap of his sword finger, billions of refined Clear Qi swords materialized from thin air. In the next instant, they merged into one, transforming into a sword of judgment that cleaved through the Clear Qi of Heaven and Earth.

The two traded blows, their laws intertwining and colliding, turning the world upside down. For a time, they were locked in a stalemate.

Just as the deadlock seemed unbreakable, a sudden, unexpected change occurred.

"Amitabha... The sea of suffering is boundless; turn back, and the shore is near!"

A merciful and grand Buddhist chant suddenly rolled in from the western horizon!

A colossal Buddha's palm, large enough to cover half the sky, materialized from countless Buddhist runes. The lines on its palm depicted the Six Paths of Reincarnation, showing scenes of life and death. It radiated a terrifying will to enlighten all things and suppress all evil demons and heretical paths. Ignoring the Lord of the Clear Source, it ruthlessly抓向 the faintly visible floating platform of the Primordial Sect.

Its target was clearly the Void Channel behind the platform, which connected to the Taihua Void Realm.

This move was a masterstroke, aiming to cut off the Primordial Sect's retreat.

"The East Pole Old Ghost of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect!"

The Lord of the Clear Source erupted with fury. His divine sense, like a thunderclap, shot straight into a churning sea of clouds and a realm of swords in the eastern sky.

"Dongxu! If you continue to watch from the sidelines, do you believe I will immediately summon three other fellow sect members and tear down the gates of your Myriad Chariots Sword Sect first? Let's see if your Myriad Calamities Annihilation Sword Array can withstand the combined might of four Lords!"

This threat was naked and direct. Using the Heavenly Dao of the Taihua Void Realm, he ensured his voice reached its intended destination.

"Hmph! Qingyuan, the face of your Primordial Sect isn't worth my intervention!"

A cold, indifferent voice, as if formed by the friction of billions of sword qi, came from the depths of the sea of clouds.

The Lord of the Clear Source's expression turned slightly grim. He hadn't expected another Lord-level figure, one who had proven their Dao and attained their fruit, to be in this celestial realm.

The intelligence he had received was flawed.

This Heavenly Realm seemed to be no weakling.

But with only two Golden Core Lord-level figures, the Lord of the Clear Source's expression was inscrutable, and he had already formulated a plan in his heart.

But the next moment.

*Swish!*

An indescribable sword light suddenly blazed from the depths of the Xiayun Sea of Clouds in this celestial realm.

This sword light was neither gold nor jade, colorless and formless. It possessed only a pure, ultimate "Emptiness" that could sever and annihilate all matter. Its trajectory completely defied logic, as if ignoring the distance of space and time. It had only just appeared when it pierced the center of the descending, giant Buddha's palm.

There was no earth-shattering explosion, only a silence as if a piece of the heavens and earth had been forcibly erased.

The core character seal at the center of the palm's heart instantly shattered. Along with it, a solid section of the surrounding Buddhist kingdom space silently collapsed and vanished.

The giant Buddha's palm, like a popped soap bubble, transformed into a sky full of dissipating golden light and a piercing Buddhist wail.

This is my chance!

Down in the valley, Xu Yunfan's eyes shone with a brilliant light.

The Lords were locked in a stalemate, their shockwaves sweeping through the eight directions. Even the lock of this world's Heavenly Dao was being interfered with by the violent fluctuations, leaving it in disarray.

This was the perfect time to... fish in troubled waters...

No, to infiltrate the core area of the Celestial Palace in search of great opportunities.

At the South Heaven Gate, the disciples of the Primordial Sect were locked in a frenzied and chaotic assault. He, possessing methods to conceal his aura, had the perfect opportunity to strike at the core.

He still had time to absorb the world's root qi, but the enemy's main base in the Celestial Palace was in chaos, an opportunity not to be missed.

If there had only been one Heavenly Emperor, and he had been plundered by the Lords first, then they would only be able to pick up the scraps. But now, a chance had appeared.

His true energy surged, and his body shifted slightly, preparing to transform into an intangible bolt of lightning and escape into the void.

*Chi!*

*Chi!*

*Chi!*

Three incredibly condensed streams of spiritual light—black, silver, and red—shot through the air from three extremely tricky angles, like venomous snakes that had been waiting for this exact moment.

The three streams of light intersected, instantly forming a cage of light woven from the three colors. It not only sealed off all his escape routes, but its powerful binding force also made the surrounding space as viscous as glue, almost capable of restraining his divine sense as well.

Xu Yunfan forcefully halted his momentum. The lightning beneath his feet exploded, shattering the rock beneath him as he stabilized his form.

His face was expressionless, his icy gaze sweeping towards the source of the spiritual light.

High above a shattered cliff not far away, three figures silently materialized in a triangular formation.

The leader, dressed in a black-gold Daoist robe, had a gloomy expression like water. His narrow eyes flickered with greed and scorching killing intent. He was clearly a powerful True Person at the late Foundation Establishment stage.

His formidable spiritual pressure pressed down without restraint, like an abyss or a prison.

To his left was a female cultivator in a silver-threaded cloud-patterned skirt. Her eyes were as cold as frost, and a small sword resembling a bamboo leaf flitted around her. Her aura was restrained, yet she seemed even more profound and dangerous than the late Foundation Establishment True Person beside her. She was at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, clearly skilled in assassination and sinister arts. Her eyes held no emotion, like frozen, dead water.

To his right was a bald, burly man of异常魁梧 build, his skin faintly glowing with a metallic luster. He wore only a red beast-skin vest, his muscles twisted like gnarled old roots. On his back was a huge, dark-black axe the size of a door panel. He was wreathed in a thick aura of bloodthirsty killing intent and violent demonic energy. He too was at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.

Xu Yunfan recognized these three.

They were three of the seven True Persons who had descended to this celestial realm with him.

They were the powerful subordinates of the Heavenly Calculation True Person: Zhao Moyang, a late Foundation Establishment cultivator who primarily practiced the *True Scripture of the玄Yin Soul Slaying*; Leng Yuehua, infamous for her *Bone-Dissolving Soul-Destroying Needles*; and Sun Qishan, the violent and bloodthirsty cultivator from the Hundred Calamities Peak who常年镇守 the Blood Fiend魔Cave and had mastered the *Hundred-Forged Heavenly Demon War Body* to a proficient level.

"Senior Brother Zhao, Junior Sister Leng, Senior Brother Sun."

Xu Yunfan's tone was flat, betraying no anger or joy. His gaze swept over the undisguised greed and malice on their faces.

"You've surrounded me. What do you intend to do? The Celestial Palace has not yet fallen, and the main generals are turning on each other. If you delay the sect's grand plan, can you bear the wrath of a Lord?"

He secretly gathered his energy. The Word of Strife silently circulated within him, and his roiling blood and soul began to slowly rise, their speed increasing by the second.

The series of intense battles and the control of the great array had depleted some of his energy. Now, facing three powerful enemies who were at their peak and fully prepared, the pressure on him increased sharply.

Especially with one of them being a late Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly; it seemed he would have to use some of his trump cards.

"Hehehe..."

Zhao Moyang let out a dry, grating laugh. His greedy gaze was fixed on Xu Yunfan, as if looking at a rare treasure.

"Junior Brother Xu, why play dumb? We're fellow sect members, so I won't beat around the bush."
