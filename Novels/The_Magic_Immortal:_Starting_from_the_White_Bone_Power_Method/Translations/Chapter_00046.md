# Chapter 46: Water-Fire Escape Art

After briefly toying with his magical power, Wang Chan's consciousness pierced through flesh and blood to behold the dark true bone beneath, where intricate patterns of magical restrictions interconnected, forming a thunder-patterned seal.

The seal was mysteriously profound, pure white in color yet exuding the most yang and unyielding aura of thunder. With a thought, the sinister true power hidden within the true bone surged like a tide, threatening to erupt—Wang Chan was simulating a scenario where the sinister true power would backlash.

Just as the true power was about to break free from the confines of the true bone, the white thunder-patterned seal suddenly crackled with electricity. In an instant, it condensed into a faintly visible white thunder-garment that tightly enveloped the entire true bone.

No matter how the sinister true power surged and roiled, it couldn't break through. Instead, the thunder-garment continuously emitted bolts of lightning that struck the true power, as if subjecting it to a thunderstorm.

Interestingly, though the sinister true power initially appeared weakened after being agitated by the thunder-garment, upon reforming moments later, it became slightly more refined than before.

This white thunder-garment was the manifestation of the **[Thunder Sealing Seal]**. Through his recent explorations, Wang Chan discovered that as long as he reinforced the seal every half month, he would never have to worry about the sinister true power leaking out and exposing his demonic roots. This brought him considerable peace of mind, and whenever he encountered other cultivators now, he spoke with much more confidence.

Moreover, this seal was a sealing technique that could also block spiritual sense, spells, and divine abilities from detection. It could be used not only on himself but also on others or objects. For instance, had he possessed this seal during the incident with the tiger-jiao corpse, he wouldn't have had to discard so much material—at least the jiao teeth could have been brought back.

Unless the beauty mark woman's **[Autumn Wind Cicada]** was of a higher grade than the **[Thunder Sealing Seal]**, she would have no way to track him.

Most importantly, Wang Chan had developed the habit of drawing out his sinister true power daily and agitating it with the seal, using this method to refine the power. Since it was thunder-attribute, once he perfected the **[Thunder Sealing Seal]** and elevated it to a high-grade seal, its power would undoubtedly become even more formidable.

With this daily refinement, he wondered if he could elevate the quality of his sinister true power from low-grade to mid-grade. If that happened, and the power then fed back into his magical energy... heh... his foundation would only grow stronger.

With a faint smile, Wang Chan abruptly stood up and left the underground chamber to draw a bath.

He stuffed thick spirit wood into the earthen stove and lit it, causing flames to roar to life. Amid the flickering blaze, a streak of fire suddenly shot into the stove's flames at a speed invisible to the naked eye.

Looking around, Wang Chan's figure had vanished without a trace.

After a long while, a tongue of flame licked out from the stove's mouth, and Wang Chan emerged from it before transforming into a wave of water and plunging into a nearby spirit spring vat. Strangely, despite the large splash, not a single drop spilled, nor were there any ripples—as if nothing had happened at all.

"Whoosh!"

Moments later, a surge of spirit spring water rose and landed perfectly in a spirit pot. At the same time, Wang Chan reappeared beside the stove as if materializing from thin air.

"Truly the **[Water-Fire Escape Art]**—even with just one layer of restriction, it's this profound. Imagine how marvelous it'll be once all restrictions are complete and it's elevated to divine status," Wang Chan mused, hands clasped behind his back as he watched the spirit water in the pot begin to bubble.

The **[Water-Fire Escape Art]** allowed him to transform into water or fire, enabling rapid long-distance travel while also providing exceptional concealment. When moving through water or fire, he could merge seamlessly with them, evading detection. With this art, combined with **[Dragon's Vigor, Tiger's Might]**, the black and white needles, and the mid-grade **[Soul Suppressing Talisman]** in his soul sea, Wang Chan felt much more at ease. No matter how vast the wilderness, he could now protect himself.

After bathing and changing, Wang Chan lit a spirit incense in his bedroom, intending to sleep soundly so he could visit the Black River Market early the next day. Unexpectedly, someone knocked on his door.

From the rhythm of the knock, it was Zhang the Hunchback.

Since partnering with Luo Bing to tend the fields, Zhang's hunch seemed less pronounced, and his vitality had improved, as if he had found a second lease on life.

Why was he visiting Wang Chan at this hour instead of spending time with the alluring Luo Bing?

Wang Chan opened the door to find Zhang squatting outside, smoking a pipe with the air of a farmer fretting over a poor harvest.

"Fellow Daoist Wang," Zhang said upon seeing him, quickly standing and stowing his pipe before cupping his hands in greeting. "I've recently acquired some spirit tea. The moonlight is enchanting tonight—care to join me for a chat?"

"Fellow Daoist Zhang's spirit tea must be excellent. Please, come in," Wang Chan replied warmly, ushering him into the courtyard.

After tea and small talk, Zhang took a deep drag from his pipe and said hoarsely, "I've sold my family's **[Wind Spirit Hoe]** and scraped together some extra spirit coins. Tomorrow, I'm heading to White Mountain City to purchase a low-grade formation."

Wang Chan listened quietly.

The **[Wind Spirit Hoe]** was a fully restricted (27 layers) artifact, indispensable for tending spirit fields. Zhang had relied on it before becoming a mid-grade spirit farmer. It was surprising he was willing to part with it.

"You must have heard about the **[White-Haired Ghost Mosquitoes]** at Red Plum Mountain. The wilderness is in chaos—not just among cultivators, but ghosts and demonic beasts are appearing out of nowhere, each more terrifying than the last," Zhang said anxiously. "Without a low-grade formation to protect my home, I don't dare close my eyes at night."

Wang Chan nodded slowly.

Seven days prior, a herb gatherer at Red Plum Mountain had accidentally provoked a swarm of **[White-Haired Ghost Mosquitoes]**. That night, the swarm infiltrated the mountain, wreaking havoc and nearly draining the life force of over eighty households. Only a handful of skilled cultivators escaped, while five households survived because they had secretly set up low-grade formations, which held off the swarm until reinforcements arrived.

"I don't have much to spare, but here are twenty spirit coins..." Wang Chan said after a moment, placing the coins on the table one by one.

Zhang was a good neighbor, and buying a formation was a major undertaking for a rogue cultivator. The gesture was necessary.

"Your kindness touches me, Fellow Daoist Wang, but I've managed to gather enough coins," Zhang said, visibly moved. He pushed the coins back and added, "I'll be gone for at least half a month, maybe a month. I was hoping you could look after Luo Bing for me."

Wang Chan frowned in confusion.

"Lately, there have been unsavory male cultivators lurking around, sometimes even late at night. I'm worried," Zhang explained.

With the influx of southern migrants, the wilderness had grown chaotic, and demand for housing in spiritual caves had surged. Rent at Lotus Mountain had risen to four spirit coins per month, forcing many early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators to leave. Those who remained were either skilled or at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement. Many newcomers were mid-stage cultivators who had migrated from distant Black Water City—survivors with formidable abilities.

Luo Bing, with her curvaceous figure and delicate features, had attracted unwanted attention despite her reclusive and proper demeanor. Zhang, still at the early stage of Qi Refinement (with 36 strands of Qi), had been stuck at a bottleneck for four or five years.

Knowing that Wang Chan had connections with a fairy-like patrol officer, Zhang felt he was the best candidate for the task.

"Fellow Daoist Zhang..."

"I trust your character, Fellow Daoist Wang. Please don't refuse," Zhang said earnestly. "If I don't return within six months... please take her as your concubine. She's obedient, skilled in serving tea and water, gentle, and sweet-tongued."

Wang Chan: "..."

"Once, in her sleep, she even called your name with flushed cheeks... well, what woman doesn't love a handsome man? It's only natural..."

Wang Chan: "..."

"Also, Fellow Daoist Wang, about that wine... ahem, could you spare some? A trip to White Mountain City shouldn't be wasted—I'd like to enjoy myself too."

---

In the end, Wang Chan reluctantly agreed to Zhang's request and even gifted him a bottle of **[Giant Ant Strength Wine]**. As long-time neighbors and given Zhang's trust, he had no reason to refuse. Besides, it was a trivial matter for him now.

After seeing Zhang off, Wang Chan sighed inwardly.

A few months ago, faced with the current state of the wilderness, he might have been as anxious as Zhang. Still, if the opportunity arose, acquiring a low-grade formation for protection wouldn't be a bad idea—it would help conceal his sinister aura during cultivation and provide security.

Standing by the window, he exhaled deeply and was about to close it when his brow furrowed again.

*Tap.*

*Tap-tap.*

Another knock—gentle, unfamiliar.

Before he could ask who it was, a delicate voice bypassed the simple formation and reached his ears:

"Fellow Daoist Wang, I'll first take a bath and change. Please bear with me and administer the rejuvenating acupuncture later. These past few months of constant travel have left me exhausted."
