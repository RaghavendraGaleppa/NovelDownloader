# Night Without End - Chapter 9: Golden Jade Suit

As the shallow night neared its end, Qin Ming awoke. The sunstone in the copper basin emitted a soft, fiery glow, and the house was quiet.

He was parched, his throat feeling like it was on fire. After gulping down several large bowls of ice water, he finally let out a long breath.

Soon, he noticed something was off. His clothes felt tight against his skin, almost too small.

Realizing what had happened, he stood against the doorframe and measured himself, confirming that he had indeed grown taller.

Qin Ming was lost in thought. He had only slept, but the process was beyond imagination, nurturing a rich, new life force in a short amount of time, and his innate foundation had developed again.

He stretched his limbs, feeling like he had inexhaustible strength. He went to the courtyard and easily lifted the two stone grinding discs.

Then, he tried holding them up with one hand. Although it felt heavy, he could briefly manage it.

Qin Ming was astonished. He could now barely lift over four hundred pounds with one hand. Didn't that mean he wasn't any worse than those famous young men in the bright city in the distance?

He took off his ill-fitting clothes and discovered that the scab on his shoulder had fallen off, leaving no scar behind. This was also a manifestation of his rebirth.

Afterward, he began preparing dinner.

Qin Ming cooked a pot of meat soup and roasted the wolf ribs until they were fragrant and tempting. Using mutated creatures as ingredients was enough to satisfy his body's need for "rebirth."

He ate large pieces of meat and drank big bowls of soup. His body was already hot, but now he was sweating profusely, and a warm current surged through him, spreading throughout his body.

Although the rebirth was in its final stages, it wasn't over yet. He wanted to strike while the iron was hot, fully stimulating his body's activity to promote the process.

His physique was improving rapidly. Difficult movements from the past could now be performed casually and effortlessly.

It felt like a ball of fire was burning inside Qin Ming's body, about to shine through his skin.

Finally, patches of "golden dots" appeared on his skin, then "broke through the soil," and golden bristles emerged. Although extremely small, they were faintly discernible.

This was unusual and had never happened before.

The "golden bristles" emerged from his flesh, bringing out faint traces of blood. It looked frightening at first glance, but it didn't actually harm his body.

Qin Ming felt a sense of relief, and his body's energy became fresher, more vibrant, and full of vitality. This process felt like "detoxification."

Then he understood that this was a thorough rebirth, cutting off harmful substances.

His original pores seemed insufficient, and clusters of "golden bristles" emerged, drilling out of his body, mixed with traces of blood, carrying away old impurities.

Golden light constantly appeared, densely packed, like golden needles moving around, echoing each other, weaving across Qin Ming's body, as if sewing clothes, forming a strange sight.

Combined with the faint white mist around his body, he looked quite ethereal.

He was tireless and consumed a lot of energy. When he was hungry, he ate wolf ribs, and after a short rest, he would continue to stimulate his body's activity.

Occasionally, he would also study Lu Ze's "Elementary Explanation of Night Meditation."

Throughout the night, Qin Ming discharged a lot of sweat, and his metabolism was extremely vigorous.

His body was numb, as if sprouting branches and leaves, full of vitality, carrying the aura of the beginning of all things.

When a strong sleepiness came over him, he stopped moving.

He realized that he was about to enter the final stage of "hibernation."

After a simple wash, he lay on the bed, his eyelids almost closing.

Blurrily, he saw a faint silver light appearing on his skin, and even more golden bristles emerging, like golden needles flying and weaving, "weaving cloth" in the silver-white mist.

Although very sleepy, Qin Ming was still deeply amazed. The golden threads crisscrossed, dividing the silver light into blocks, forming a dense grid, and overall, his body seemed to be wrapped in a "golden jade suit."

He was somewhat lost in thought, his mind wandering, thinking about many things.

Ancient emperors were buried in jade boxes adorned with pearls, connected with gold threads, expressing their desire for longevity, pursuing it even in death.

Was the "wild method" he had learned in his childhood so special? During the rebirth transformation, a layer of pure white mist naturally flowed, and the golden threads connected, actually resembling a golden jade suit.

Could it be that the ancient emperors had heard some rumors, so they ordered people to make golden jade suits?

He shook his head, feeling like he was overthinking it. Then he couldn't hold on any longer and fell into the deepest sleep.

As the shallow night arrived, Qin Ming woke up, feeling his body was tight. Soon he understood the situation. He had sweated a lot during the night, and the golden needles had brought out traces of blood. These "old impurities" had dried on his skin, forming a thin cocoon.

The water tank contained a whole block of ice. He smashed it into pieces, boiled a pot of water, and after washing up, he changed into loose and clean clothes, feeling refreshed.

Clearly, his body temperature had dropped, which meant that the "rebirth" was almost over.

Qin Ming went to the courtyard and lifted the two stone grinding discs again. This time it was easier, and he could hold them up with one hand for a long time.

Then, he put a stone lock weighing over a hundred pounds on top.

"Very heavy!" He felt it was very heavy in his hand, quite strenuous.

The two rough stone grinding discs, plus the stone lock used to exercise arm strength, weighed more than five hundred pounds, but he could still hold them up with one hand.

Lu Ze had told him that in the distant bright city, there were young men who could lift a six-hundred-pound tripod.

Qin Ming's eyes were clear, and he showed a bright smile. His arms had the strength of a thousand pounds.

As for the more distant ends of the earth, those mysterious and unknown cities, he didn't know how powerful the newborns in the golden age were.

Qin Ming picked up half a saber-horned deer, as well as a hind leg and some ribs of a donkey-headed wolf, and went to the neighboring courtyard.

"Little Qin, this... is too much!"

"Brother Lu, Sister-in-law, I can't eat it all by myself. Anyway, I'll still go into the mountains, and it's better to change the taste often," Qin Ming said.

If it hadn't been for Lu Ze's care during the previous period, he might have starved to death.

"Uncle, you're so good. Otherwise, we would have been starving in a few days," Wen Rui said happily, because he had heard his parents say that the family's food was almost gone.

Qin Ming touched his head and said, "With Uncle here, how could I let you starve?"

The mutated squirrel jumped up and down in the cage, only it was indignant, chirping at Qin Ming. This intelligent little mountain beast was very vengeful.

"Little Qin..." Village Chief Xu Yueping came, wearing a beast skin jacket, looking to be in his forties, with a slightly square face, thick eyebrows, bright eyes, and a strong body.

"Uncle Xu." Qin Ming greeted him.

He laughed heartily and said, "I knew you, kid, would be promising. Taking this step is like stepping on a golden footprint."

He wanted to know how strong Qin Ming's physical fitness was after his rebirth in the golden age.

"Little Qin, you've grown taller. Is the rebirth over?" Lu Ze asked.

Qin Ming was about to respond when he suddenly felt a gust of wind coming at him.

Xu Yueping's right hand was like a knife, unexpectedly chopping towards his neck.

The matter was too sudden, and such a close distance made it difficult to defend against.

But Qin Ming successfully avoided it and counterattacked accurately, grabbing his wrist with a bang.

"Your reaction speed is far beyond other newborns," Xu Yueping exclaimed. At such a close distance, his sudden attack would be difficult to avoid even for the most sensitive mountain beasts.

Liang Wanqing exclaimed, then realized that he was testing Qin Ming's foundation after his rebirth.

Xu Yueping's wrist was firmly grasped, and he couldn't shake it at all.

"Your reborn strength..." He showed a surprised look.

Lu Ze and Liang Wanqing were looking forward to it, hoping that Qin Ming's physical fitness could be greatly improved, with a qualitative change.

Because this was related to a person's life, it was a chance to change fate.

Qin Ming let go.

Xu Yueping's eyelids twitched wildly. He was the strongest newborn in Shuangshu Village and had already seen that the young man in front of him had not used his full strength.

He said solemnly, "I guess you have almost six hundred pounds of strength."

Liang Wanqing was stunned when she heard this. It should be known that the limit for newborns in this area to lift a tripod was five hundred pounds.

Lu Ze was very excited and said, "This... even if you go to that distant city, you won't be worse than others."

"Uncle is the best!" Wen Rui shouted, clapping his little hands.

"Lao Xu, the mountain patrol team is here." Yang Yongqing appeared, just in time to hear what he had said, and his heart was shaken.

He realized that Qin Ming had broken the upper limit of the local newborns.

The appearance of the mountain patrol team meant that things were definitely not simple. Xu Yueping and Yang Yongqing quickly left.

After a cup of tea's time, someone came to call Qin Ming, asking him to go to the village chief's house.

He was a little puzzled, why were they looking for him?

"All newborns have to participate and listen to the mountain patrol team talk about the situation in the mountains," the person told him.

Xu Yueping's house was very lively. Including Qin Ming, there were seven newborns in the village, and they had all come, even the seventy-year-old Liu Lao Tou was present.

The sunstone illuminated the room brightly, and the atmosphere was harmonious. The mountain patrol team member, Feng Yi'an, was talking about the situation in the mountains.

"The magnetic field in the mountains was chaotic some time ago. It's easy to get lost if you go deep, and there have been many strange things. Some of the hot springs where dangerous creatures live have almost gone out, while high-level hot springs have been born in the depths of the night mist." Feng Yi'an had a big beard and was quite rough and unrestrained, drinking the tea in his cup in one gulp.

Qin Ming finally knew why the mountains had been so chaotic recently, and why some behemoths had appeared in the outer areas of the dense forest.

Because there had been changes in the mountains, and the nests of some famous birds and strange beasts had problems, they were restless, causing other creatures to flee.

"Will the situation worsen? What if high-level species rush out?" Someone asked.

"Everyone, please rest assured that high-level figures will enter the mountains and talk to those mysterious creatures to restore peace to this area as soon as possible."

Feng Yi'an said that even if the negotiations failed, there would be big figures to block the top creatures in the mountains.

"Just in case, the mountain patrol team members are on standby, and all newborns in the villages and towns outside the mountains must also be prepared."

Feng Yi'an explained that the high-level officials were mainly preventing top creatures, but perhaps some "small fish" would slip through the net.

Everyone's faces were solemn when they heard this. Newborns had to participate in the war when necessary!

Feng Yi'an smiled and said, "Don't be nervous, it's not as serious as you think. Besides, if there is a war, the bright city in the distance will send noble children to train, all of whom are elites, and they will help us sweep the mountains."

The people present breathed a sigh of relief when they heard this.

"Brother Feng patrolled the mountains late at night and came early in the morning to bring us news. It's really hard work," Xu Yueping said.

Feng Yi'an waved his hand and said, "Brother Xu, what are you talking about? This is all my duty. Don't worry, if fierce beasts and mountain monsters rush out, they will have to step over the bodies of our mountain patrol team members, otherwise they will never hurt the people outside the mountains."

Xu Yueping personally brought up a large iron plate with a whole roasted rock sheep on it, fragrant and inviting, to entertain Feng Yi'an.

He stopped the few people who wanted to get up and leave and said, "Don't go, let's have a few drinks with Brother Feng."

The atmosphere in the room suddenly became lively.

"Let me tell you, there's no need to worry. This time, not only will the city lord who governs this area come in person, but it is said that experts have also been invited from afar. There won't be any trouble. The main thing is to guard against moon worms and unpredictable mountain masters appearing."

After a few drinks, Feng Yi'an revealed a lot of information.

Qin Ming was surprised and listened carefully.

He was not used to the spicy old wine at the banquet. He wanted to drink some tea, but he put down the cup again. In addition to bitter tea, there were also dried ants the size of a thumb, making the tea soup complex.

Xu Yueping smiled and said, "Little Qin, men must learn to drink alcohol. Also, these black ants are a great tonic, really good stuff."

Feng Yi'an turned his head and looked over, saying, "This little brother looks young and unfamiliar."

"Uncle Feng, just call me Little Qin."

Xu Yueping introduced, "This is Qin Ming, a little over sixteen years old. He just successfully completed his rebirth and is the most promising young man in this area. I hope he can go to the distant Crimson Cloud City to study."

"A good seedling, transforming in the golden age. What an enviable foundation," Feng Yi'an said with great emotion.

The others also praised and envied him, knowing how great the potential of someone with a golden foundation was.

Everyone kept toasting, and the atmosphere at the table was lively. Feng Yi'an told some bizarre events in the mountains.

"Have you ever seen some mysterious fields in the deep mountains? All the crops are golden in color, and the thick fog can't cover them. The brilliant golden light breaks through the dark night sky... Whose rations are those?"
