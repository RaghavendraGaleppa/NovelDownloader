# Chapter 237: The Sword Rises, the Nine Peaks Resound

The hexagonal lattice of the dragon scale armor's heart mirror flickered frantically. One thousand, seven hundred and twenty inverse scales flared outward simultaneously, yet they could not stop the piercing strike that exceeded the speed of sound.

"噗!"

The sword tip penetrated three inches into the flesh before being stopped by the板肋 (plate-like ribs). The woman's gaze shifted upward, looking at Xu Yunfan's face.

Xu Yunfan showed neither sorrow nor joy. His waist suddenly exploded with force as he spun, allowing the sword blade to carve a bloody hole in his ribs. With the momentum of a death-seeking strike, his heavy mace smashed toward the woman's heaven-spirit point.

This move was the final path of the eighteen techniques of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method: "Ten Thousand Mountains Paying Homage to the Ancestor." Abandoning all defense, he sacrificed his life for righteousness, striking out with the heavy mace in a relentless, forward-charging stance.

Under the force that poured out everything he had, the wind from the mace actually compressed the air into a liquid state!

Ripples finally appeared in the woman's eyes.

She abandoned her sword and leaned back, her slender waist bending into a startling arc. Her tiptoes tapped the body of the mace nine times in succession.

Each tap exploded into ice crystals on the dragon scale armor, and the final kick landed squarely on Xu Yunfan's throat.

"Crack!"

Four crescent scales on the neck armor shattered.

Xu Yunfan flew backward like a cannonball, crashing through three sword peaks before coming to a stop.

Before the dust could settle, he had already crouched and risen again, his eyes, burned red by the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength, locked tightly on the enemy.

"Not bad."

The woman's cold voice suddenly sounded by his ear.

Xu Yunfan immediately sensed that the heavy mace in his hand had become incredibly heavy. Unknowingly, thousands of frost blades had condensed into ice chains wrapping around the mace's body!

Even the continuously erupting magma-like patterns on the mace were frozen solid at this moment.

He decisively abandoned the mace, pushing the Black Steel Hundred-Refined Body to its limit. His fists transformed into red meteors,轰向 the woman's chest.

The instant his fist锋 touched her plain clothes, the moonlight suddenly flared brightly.

The nine sword peaks simultaneously emitted a startling sword cry, as if a vast starlight condensed into a three-foot光 blade at the woman's fingertips.

Xu Yunfan saw his own reflection shattering on the blade. It was a speed that surpassed the understanding of martial artists, as if the moonlight itself was挥剑!

"Strike, Mace!!"

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace sensed its master's crisis and shot to him from beneath his feet.

But it was all too late.

The light blade gently划过 Xu Yunfan's neck.

The dragon scale armor emitted a dying hum, and one thousand, seven hundred and twenty inverse scales vaporized in the moonlight.

The Black Steel Hundred-Refined Body melted away like wax under the blazing sun. The blood Qi and wolf smoke formed by the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength was split in two by the sword Qi.

In Xu Yunfan's final field of vision, he saw his headless body still挥拳.

The fist wind tore a blood line across the woman's cheek, revealing a冷艳 face similar to the极道遗蜕 vest.

The moonlight reflected in the cold pool suddenly turned blood red.

The instant the sword Qi touched his skin, the one thousand, seven hundred and twenty inverse scales of the dragon scale armor simultaneously erupted with赤芒.

The dragon essence blood sealed by the strongest swordsmith of the Divine Weapon Ridge疯狂燃烧, attempting to抵挡 this sword that transcended the material boundary.

Xu Yunfan's pupils reflected the trajectory of the sword light.

The Lin Character Mantra stretched time by a hundred times. He clearly saw how the sword Qi tore through the air. It was not a simple slash, but a vacuum blade formed by the moonlight collapsing upon itself under the牵引 of sword intent!

The Black Steel Hundred-Refined Body崩溃 first.

The tempered muscles and flesh disintegrated at the molecular level under the sword Qi, and the bronze-colored skin剥落 like weathered pottery.

The Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength transformed into three thousand blood-red streams that burst out of his body,蒸腾 into scarlet mist under the moonlight.

The sound of bones breaking was like a continuous string of firecrackers.

First, the toe bones turned to dust in the aftermath of the sword Qi, followed by spiderweb-like cracks appearing on the shin bone. The cracks spiraled upward along the leg bone.

When the sword Qi掠过 the pelvic bone, the entire skeleton was already covered in light cracks, like a摔碎 jade carving.

The dragon scale armor emitted a dying哀鸣.

The hexagonal lattice of the heart mirror爆裂 one by one,飞溅 fragments vaporized in the moonlight.

The Red Python scales wrapped around the heart area拼命收缩, but were掀开 by the aftermath of the sword Qi, revealing the violently beating heart.

The most tragic was the head.

The lower jaw bone detached first, teeth falling out with a clatter in the sword Qi.

The nasal cartilage melted into a gelatinous substance, the blood vessels and nerves in the eye sockets绞碎 like tangled messes.

When the skull cap was整个掀起, the azure light of the Lin Character Mantra was still flowing within the cranial cavity, until it was finally swallowed by the moonlight.

When the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace finally arrived, it only caught a handful of bloody rain mixed with bone渣.

The heavy mace trembled violently in the moonlight, the nine dragon patterns渗出 blood, as if悲鸣 for its master.

The surface of the cold pool reflected the final scene: Xu Yunfan's headless body still maintaining the punching posture, his knuckles碎裂 inch by inch in the moonlight.

The woman picked up the bronze hairpin sword and turned to leave. The tear on her plain clothes slowly渗出 ice crystals, freezing the猩红 bloodstains into frost flowers.

"..."

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes and sat up abruptly.

His expression shifted不定, and finally.

"Go to hell!"

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but curse. Being in the state of the Lin Character, with his body under his全方位 control, he clearly felt his body crumbling inch by inch under the woman's sword Qi.

Recalling it now was simply a torturous experience.

"Exactly what level is that..."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a trace of doubt in his heart, and it seemed the woman had become much more清醒.

His heart moved slightly. He slowly got up, moved his hands and feet, and touched the dragon scale armor and Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace on his body.

The sword Qi of that mysterious woman was truly too惊艳.

Xu Yunfan was certain that even a Ninth Realm Qi-Gathering Supreme Grandmaster would not be able to挥洒 such peerless sword Qi as that woman.

One sword rises, the nine peaks move.

It was also his own fault for having insufficient spiritual power, unable to completely replicate the full might of the two divine weapons, the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace and the dragon scale armor.

After吸了参气 (absorbing the ginseng Qi) and beginning to cultivate the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, Xu Yunfan suddenly opened his eyes.

He looked up and was only then surprised to find that the元灵 Qi gathered in the surrounding mountain terrain was now thin to the point of almost non-existence.

If not for the method of seeking dragons and distinguishing veins, he really wouldn't have been able to confirm it.

Why has the spiritual Qi decreased so much?

Xu Yunfan subconsciously touched his chest. The dragon scale armor trembled slightly, instantly裂开 a slit, revealing the极道遗蜕 vest tied up inside.

At this moment, it actually presented a faint,淡清辉 luster.

"..."

At this moment, Xu Yunfan understood clearly that the spiritual Qi gathered between the mountain terrain had been completely吞噬 by this vest of the Extreme Way Legacy.

He immediately lost the mood to continue practicing. Confirming there were no lost items around, he walked out of the cave and looked at Qi Huan, who was sitting in meditation on a tree.

He saw that Qi Huan had threads of漆黑 like雾的妖魔气息攒动,萦绕周身.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow slightly and didn't say much, just开口道: "Let's go."

Qi Huan opened his eyes, looking at Xu Yunfan who had背负好 a hammer and a mace. The demonic Qi around him suddenly收敛入身.

He轻盈落地后, his expression was somewhat complex.

"Are we really going to that place?"

Qi Huan turned to look at the mountain peak in the distance where赤霞翻涌. Listening carefully, one could faintly hear a sound like the呼啸 of a mountain range.

This was not the呼啸 of the mountains, but the breathing of some huge creature.

Xu Yunfan naturally understood what Qi Huan was thinking.

"Naturally, we must go and take a look. If there is a chance, we definitely cannot let it go. If you are unwilling, I will not force you."
