# Chapter 17: The Four Halls of Mystic Talisman Sect

“Ah, Green Hornet, when will you finally awaken your intelligence…?”

The longer Ding Rui stayed in this world, the more curious he became about its wonders. He simply couldn’t imagine how many more beings and phenomena existed in this cultivation world that defied his wildest dreams.

…

After the harvest, the spirit field returned to its tranquil state. As the spirit rice seeds germinated, the spirit field cultivators became busy once more.

However, after a few days of work, Old Huang suddenly approached Ding Rui, requesting, “Little Ding, could you please take on a bit more of the work in the spirit field for a while? I need some time to focus entirely on my cultivation.”

“Are you about to break through?” Ding Rui couldn't help but ask.

Old Huang was the cultivator with the highest cultivation level in Spirit Field 377, and also someone with exceptional cultivation talent. He wasn't very old, but he had been at the third stage of Qi Condensation for a year and was on the verge of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage.

“Yes!” Old Huang nodded.

“That’s wonderful news!” Ding Rui immediately thumped his chest. “No problem at all, leave it to me!”

Old Huang smiled, his whole demeanor visibly relaxing a few shades. He nodded vigorously in thanks. “I won’t forget your help this time. Once I break through to Foundation Establishment, I will repay you a hundredfold!”

“Are you sure about a hundredfold repayment?” Ding Rui feigned a look of surprise. “That’s no small sum.”

Initially, Old Huang had only asked for 3,000 spirit grains, but Ding Rui insisted on lending him 10,000. Old Huang eventually accepted it, as he wasn't sure if 3,000 grains would truly be enough. His acupoint capacity was unusual, allowing him to store far more spiritual energy than others. This was also why, despite Old Huang’s excellent cultivation talent, he had been stuck at the third stage of Qi Condensation for so long.

After taking the spirit rice, Old Huang became reclusive, spending his entire days in cultivation. Meanwhile, even with the added responsibility of all pest control for Spirit Field 377, Ding Rui found it effortless, though it did mean sacrificing some of his own cultivation time. To ensure he still had enough time for his own cultivation, Ding Rui had to reduce the number of times he went out to work. While this meant earning fewer resources, resources were precisely what Ding Rui lacked least at the moment. As long as he maintained his ability to exterminate large aphids, his iron rice bowl was secure.

After two full months of dedicated cultivation, Old Huang finally emerged! He successfully entered the Foundation Establishment stage, reported it to the sect, and directly became an outer disciple, leaving Spirit Field 377. Since the sect knew of Ding Rui's talent in the *Golden Radiance Art* and that he could single-handedly manage the pest control for Spirit Field 377, they did not assign any more *Golden Radiance Art* cultivators there. Spirit Field 377, which had originally only housed seven cultivators, now found itself with even fewer hands.

This was the first time Ding Rui felt a touch of helplessness due to the lack of alcohol in this world. It wasn't fulfilling enough!

…

The next day, after formally seeing Old Huang off, Ding Rui asked Liu Yun and the others during their lunch break: “What is the Battle Hall?”

“You don’t know?” Liu Yun was startled, then quickly realized. “Ah, right, you had amnesia once, so it’s understandable you wouldn’t know. Let me briefly explain it to you. Even though you might become a spirit farmer, you will eventually have to join one of the four halls.”
