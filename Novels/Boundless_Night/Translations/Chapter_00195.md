Chapter 195: Winds of Change Gather

Wu Chengwang and Qin Ming were both smiling, pleased with each other and finding each other agreeable. The atmosphere was harmonious; perhaps this was a win-win situation.

Soon, Qin Ming became alert. He couldn't get carried away. This was a one-time deal; he didn't plan on coming again. Why was he still smiling like an idiot? He efficiently and naturally adjusted his expression, his smile slowly fading. He immersed himself in the scripture, feigning ignorance, humbly asking, "Master Wu, why does the third page of this scripture suddenly become so difficult?"

Wu Chengwang chuckled, saying, "Profound cultivation techniques are all incredibly recondite. Ninety percent of people are fated not to comprehend them at all. Fortunately, with my guidance, the Golden Cicada Scripture isn't so obscure. My disciples can cultivate it."

"Master Wu, truly worthy of being a Pioneer of Laws," Qin Ming praised. After reading the scripture, Qin Ming sighed inwardly. Old Wu was not simple; this manuscript truly embodied his painstaking efforts and contained extremely profound insights. His expression transitioned naturally, from boisterous laughter to a slight smile, then to seriousness, and finally a furrowed brow, because he was ready to leave; there was no need to stay long.

To his surprise, Wu Chengwang found him quite agreeable. Not only did he offer guidance, but he also invited him to study in the small courtyard, claiming the flowers and plants there could refresh the mind. "Don't be impatient. I recall when I first cultivated this scripture, I was stuck for a long time too," he said genially. For all these years, everyone who came to him to learn profound techniques had been filled with bitterness and never smiled. It was rare to encounter such a cheerful young man who put him at ease.

Qin Ming was speechless. The manuscript he was studying still carried Wu Chengwang's strong emotions. He had already resonated with two complete versions of the *Golden Cicada Scripture*. "Alas, it's too difficult. I feel I smiled too soon; this scripture just doesn't suit me," he began to make excuses. In the small courtyard, filled with medicinal herbs and exotic flowers, a riot of colors bloomed, and a fresh fragrance permeated the air. Although the environment was elegant, Qin Ming truly didn't want to stay any longer.

"You should cultivate it like this: the golden cicada is a bug, yet not a bug; it is also a Zen scripture..." Wu Chengwang intended to play the long game. He didn't want Qin Ming to get stuck at the first hurdle and began giving him personal instruction. Finally, Qin Ming endured for a full hour before naturally frowning and departing.

"What a wonderful child," Wu Chengwang said, smiling broadly as he watched Qin Ming's retreating back. "Too bad his comprehension is a bit lacking." He called out, "Come earlier next time!"

Little Wu said, "Brother, did you really spend six hundred Day Gold? Our family's savings are almost gone again."

"Yes, let's go back," Qin Ming nodded. Only after returning to his residence, facing the sapphire-like lake, did Qin Ming drop his pretense and happily fished for several Five-colored Dragon Carp. Soon after, he returned to his courtyard and began cultivating!

Wu Yaozu gasped in admiration, "Hiss, Brother, you are a true genius! You've grasped the essence and achieved something remarkable in such a short time." This was because he felt Qin Ming's aura had completely changed, imbued with a Zen rhythm. At the most crucial moment, he even heard the sound of a cicada's chirp that cleared the mind and inspired sudden enlightenment. That was not a real sound, but the heavenly Dao resonance emanating from Qin Ming's flesh, organs, and bones.

Qin Ming cautioned, "It's just the beginning. Act as if you saw nothing. If that old guy finds out, he'll probably raise a ruckus, or even attack us."

"I understand!" Wu Yaozu nodded, then went to study his *Flesh-Blood Soul Locking Art*.

Qin Ming spent the entire day cultivating the *Golden Cicada Scripture*. It not only involved revival, regeneration, and Zen intent, but the Golden Cicada Force it produced was also incredibly powerful. Without protective Dao methods, how could it be considered a profound technique? Qin Ming pondered deeply, increasingly feeling that this profound technique was vast and profound.

"If broken down, it can manifest Dead Force and Life Force, involving partial Yin-Yang transformations, ultimately forming a complete Golden Cicada Force. If this part can be cultivated, one can undergo a complete transformation, regenerating from the verge of death." Qin Ming's expression turned solemn, because this was not the end. He combined Wu Chengwang's insights with his own comprehension, continuously exploring. He believed this was a treasure of a profound technique. To this end, he used the halo formed by the Five-Element Profound Technique he cultivated to simulate the Golden Cicada Force.

"The cicada's chirp is like silk, subtle yet continuous. As long as the Zen intent endures, the Golden Cicada Force can flow endlessly." Qin Ming studied the Zen rhythm, while also focusing more on practical combat. For a time, around his body, fine rain fell like threads, cicada wings became like swords, and the Golden Cicada Force flowed ceaselessly.

"The golden cicada transforms again, its cry like thunder. At this point, the Golden Cicada Force is no longer gentle and soft, but rather vigorous and domineering. Its light can even sublimate, illuminating all directions." He studied diligently, wanting to simulate it with other Sky Light Forces, but failed. Currently, it was impossible, only causing a lot of commotion in the small courtyard.

Overall, the two versions of the Golden Cicada Scripture: one focused on the physical body's complete transformation, shedding the old shell for rebirth. The other version emphasized transformations and other aspects, manifesting various miraculous Sky Light Forces, leaning more towards practical combat.

"Above the *Golden Cicada Scripture*, there is also the *Divine Cicada Scripture*, which falls into the category of secret scriptures, on the same level as the *World-Dwelling Scripture*." Even the legendary "Otherworlder" might have some connection with the *Divine Cicada Scripture*. Qin Ming sighed inwardly. Each profound technique had higher-level continuations. This was truly a "well-ordered lineage," making him quite yearn and anticipate.

Next, he diligently cultivated the Golden Cicada Scripture, actively preparing for his ninth rebirth. This was accumulating his foundation and solidifying his roots. Each additional profound technique would significantly enhance his strength, as it could trigger a qualitative change in his Sky Light! Moreover, for his final rebirth, he wanted to make some changes, not following his previous path. However, he first had to cultivate the Golden Cicada Force!

While Qin Ming and Little Wu silently cultivated and accumulated their Dao foundation, the outside world was bustling, with countless people engaged in heated discussions. As expected, last night's duel between Ling Yu and Xin Youdao made it to the front page, reported widely. The light of a peerless genius pierced through the night mist, illuminating all regions. Although Xin Youdao lost, the night reports did not demean him, but instead gave him high praise. As for Ling Yu, it went without saying; he was finally directly addressed as 'Young Ancestor', no longer concealed.

"Ling Yu will test his sword against the world. When his realm rises, he will likely compete with those Immortal Seeds and God Seeds."
"Certainly, he's advancing on two paths and will rise rapidly. I look forward to that day!"
...The entire Kunling City was abuzz with discussions.

However, the two parties involved had complex feelings. They weren't as happy as imagined; both went to cultivate desperately! Qian Chuan looked at the newspaper in his hand, his expression colorful. He really wanted to say: No one understands the truth better than me! He gazed towards the lakeside. Amidst the emerald bamboo and golden vine trees, the houses there were inhabited by two mysterious youths who had once toppled the two geniuses highly praised in the newspapers. If this were to spread, it would undoubtedly cause a massive sensation!

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu lived fulfilling lives, each cultivating their techniques, diligently learning about the Third Desolate Land, wanting to know when they would hunt the auspicious beast. "That plateau is rich in various medicinal herbs, contains some special secret realms, and also has a large number of demons and monsters. At that time, people from all paths and different realms will have a chance to participate." This was a practical combat exercise, a military drill, and also a small-scale preview of a major expedition into the depths of the Night Mist World. Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu learned that various Daoist dojos and academies were surveying that plateau and would delineate more precise territories.

"Participants will each carry several memory crystals. They are not required to record their movements throughout, but the scenes of killing demons and monsters at the final critical moment must be recorded to ensure the authenticity of their achievements." The precautions gravely warned against internal strife. If anyone violated this, others could collectively attack to ensure legitimate self-defense.

"First Realm, Second Realm..." Qin Ming saw the rough draft that had just appeared. The terrain was complex, with marked activity zones for people of various realms. Clearly, the further one ventured into the plateau, the higher the level of the corresponding demons and monsters.

"In the First Realm, who are we afraid of? We can even try our hand in the Second Realm!" Little Wu rubbed his fists, eager to go.

Qin Ming reminded him, "Don't be arrogant. In the Second Realm, there will certainly be Near-Immortal Seeds, God Seeds, Exotic Seeds, and the like." These days, Kunling City was getting livelier. Why did Sun Taichu come with Cui Chonghe? His objective was clear! Recently, people from the Pure Lands Beyond, Immortal Lands, Yang Lands, and Esoteric Sects, including those unknown Immortal Seeds and God Seeds, were continuously arriving. The main reason was that this auspicious beast was truly extraordinary. Its blood essence could extend the lifespan of Ancestor-level figures, and its benefits for the younger generation were naturally even greater!

Wu Yaozu nodded, "Brother, let's strive for our ninth rebirth during this plateau pioneering, and even enter the Outer Saint domain! Then we can go explore the Second Realm and grab more benefits!" In Kunling City, people were discussing Ling Yu and Xin Youdao, and also hotly debating which Near-Immortal Seeds had arrived and which God Seeds had quietly appeared. Ordinary people listened with great interest, while those in the know felt the winds of change rising. This region would be hard-pressed to remain peaceful; major events would soon unfold.

"Little Sparrow, I've traveled over mountains and rivers, thousands of miles, and finally arrived at Kunling City with Princess Violet Lightning Beast and the others." A talking sparrow, carrying a small bag, descended from a huge airship with the Violet Lightning Beast, Four-Tusked White Elephant, and other extraordinary beings.

"Mountain Lord, I wonder how you are. Little Sparrow has made significant progress recently!" The talking sparrow flapped its wings, flying forward. It was now the Violet Lightning Beast's confidant.

"Little Qin has been gone for a long time. Did something really happen on the airship?" Li Qingyun had also arrived, frowning. Meng Xinghai had specifically asked him to find Qin Ming, and he also intended to meet Li Qingyue.
...

Ling Yu was vexed. After several days of calming down, he still couldn't stand it. He found Tang Jin again and strongly requested that she arrange a decisive battle with the youth from Black and White Mountain. Last time, he had been taught a lesson and reprimanded, so Tang Jin had not agreed.

"Have you successfully condensed the Five-Colored Thunder Force and Four Symbols? Have you cultivated the Sky Light by fishing with a wisp of Pure Yang spiritual consciousness as a seed? Have you thoroughly mastered the superposition and fusion of profound techniques?" Tang Jin asked him.

Ling Yu's battle intent soared. "Senior Sister, I have cultivated all of these to perfection. If I can't fight him, I won't be able to sleep, and my Dao foundation will struggle to advance even an inch."

Qin Ming had already cultivated the Golden Cicada Force. For ordinary people, a profound technique could take half a lifetime to cultivate and a lifetime to study, but for him, it was clearly not that difficult. "I need to cultivate another profound technique!" he muttered to himself. In the past, each time he underwent rebirth, he would combine one profound technique with several Sky Light Forces. But this time, he didn't want to cultivate conventional Sky Light Forces. Instead, he was preparing to see if he could simultaneously cultivate and fuse two major profound techniques.

"Next, which profound technique should I choose, and how do I acquire it?" Qin Ming frowned. After careful study, he was quite fond of the *Dragon-Serpent Scripture*. This was the profound technique cultivated by Ancestor Qingtian during his ninth rebirth. It could not only allow one to be reborn from death but also cultivate incredibly fierce Sky Light Force. Ancestor Qingtian was renowned for being able to prop up the heavens with his bare hands, possessing unparalleled divine might! Qin Ming felt that this Ancestor's path to rebirth was quite extraordinary, and the scriptures he cultivated at certain key junctures were worth serious study.

"The *Dragon-Serpent Scripture* is not easy to obtain. The Mountain River Academy has a collection, but it's not publicly available." He pondered whether he should switch to other dojos to acquire it.
