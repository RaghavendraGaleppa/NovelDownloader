# Chapter 524: Cultivation to Golden Core in This World is a Dead End

Xu Yunfan stood at the edge of the raging, chaotic torrent of impure evil energy. The Eight Scenery Cloud Qi slowly retracted into his body, leaving behind a battlefield strewn with devastation, along with the lingering scent of burnt flesh and blood in the air.

The Arhat had not suffered much damage. Fearing being intercepted by a Great True Person from the Primordial Origin Sect, he had made his single strike and immediately fled into the distance.

Xu Yunfan lowered his head and looked at Chu Chengnan, who lay nearby, on his last breath. He was like a man whose life force had been completely drained. Moments ago, this Hundred Peaks True Person had been full of imposing grandeur, on the verge of proving the Golden Core. Now, his breath was as faint as a gossamer thread, his meridians shattered throughout his body, his grotto-heaven withered, and his cultivation base had almost been crippled back to the Foundation Establishment realm, turning him into a complete废人.

There was no joy of victory. Instead, an indescribable, icy chill slowly crept up Xu Yunfan's vertebrae, freezing all the agitation within his bloodline.

In this world, to ascend to the Golden Core realm, one must contend with the overt and covert obstructions of the True Persons from the three great sects. There was simply no possibility of success.

He had no idea how the Pure Yang Patriarch from a thousand years ago managed to do it—forcing his way into the rank of a Golden Core True Person with the status of a minor world. This alone speaks volumes about just how terrifyingly talented he was.

In this world, given the current situation, it was utterly impossible to successfully ascend!

He had personally experienced the entire process.

He had also resisted the sword light.

He had witnessed Chu Chengnan cleverly seize the power of heaven and earth to overcome the Heavenly and Earthly Tribulations.

He had also personally witnessed the scene that could shatter the Dao Heart of any Foundation Establishment True Person.

The Arhat's strike was so fast that even as an observer, Xu Yunfan could not react in time. The power of the Dao Fruit from a higher realm, carried by the Demon-Subduing Rung of the spiritual treasure, was like a spear of judgment thrown by a god. It easily smashed to pieces the single sliver of opportunity to prove the Dao, which Chu Chengnan had purchased by burning the accumulation of five lifetimes as a Foundation Establishment perfection cultivator.

"Golden Core Fruit Position... The 108 Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiends..."

Xu Yunfan's mind churned over these words repeatedly. In the past, he only knew that this path was fraught with difficulties and obstacles. It was not until he personally experienced it that he truly understood the true meaning behind the word 'difficult.' It is a chasm, a heavenly moat forged by the hands of the current Golden Core True Persons themselves, standing guard over the heads of all cultivators in the Taihua Lingxu World, absolutely forbidding anyone else to touch it!

The three great sects of the world: Primordial Origin, Ten Thousand Chariots, and Bodhisattva Zen.

Like three insurmountable giant peaks, they firmly guard the only ladder to the heavens leading to a higher realm.

Within each sect, there may be open strife and covert struggle, or intricate scheming, but when an 'outsider' attempts to touch the forbidden fruit of the 'True Person circle'—the 'Golden Core Dao Fruit'—the will of the three sects manifests with astonishing tacit understanding.

How could the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land strike with such precision?

How could that Arhat ignore the spatial barrier and descend upon the key node in an instant?

That spiritual treasure, the Demon-Subduing Rung, was definitely not something an Arhat could possess or activate.

The lethal sword intent from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect that came through the void—if it weren't for the fear of the Primordial Origin True Person's counterattack, it would likely have arrived earlier and been even more sharp and fierce.

And True Person Qingyuan...

He did intercept the power of the Bodhisattva Zen Bodhisattva, but in the end, he could not defend against the scheme of borrowing a knife to kill from a 'peer' Bodhisattva that crossed realms.

And within the Primordial Origin Sect, was it ever a smooth road?

The mockery from True Person Jiuyuan, the other True Persons standing by with arms folded...

All of these were invisible man-made tribulations.

Moreover, within the Primordial Origin Sect, since True Person Qingyuan wanted Chu Chengnan to become a Golden Core True Person, there would naturally be people who did not want him to become one.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over Chu Chengnan's broken body and then in the direction where the Arhat had fallen.

This cruel reality was like a basin of ice water, extinguishing the slight self-satisfaction that had sprouted in his heart due to the Divine Thunder Scripture and the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi.

Xu Yunfan exhaled a breath, completely dispersing the sense of complacency that had risen from his attribute panel.

The True Persons of the Taihua Lingxu World were truly too shameless, too unconcerned with their status.

Not to mention that Yuan-Ying Dao Lord, the World Honored Tathagata, who repeatedly descends his will to '炸鱼' [fish-bombing, i.e., bullying newbies], but these Golden Core True Persons are also all holding max-level divine weapons to block the newbie village.

The Heavenly and Earthly Tribulations could still be braved for a sliver of hope by relying on transcendent wisdom, powerful cultivation methods, and excellent geographical advantages.

But this most terrifying, most lethal, and most unsolvable 'Man-made Tribulation'...

The willful suppression from the Golden Core True Persons standing at the pinnacle of this era.

How could one break through it?

To use a Foundation Establishment body to resist the schemes of a True Person who wields a Dao Fruit and understands a portion of heaven and earth...

It is no different from an ant trying to shake a tree.

The Primordial Origin Sect stirred up this heaven-shaking great war, sacrificing countless disciples and sect members. In Xu Yunfan's view, one of the fundamental purposes might have been for True Person Qingyuan to fight for that sliver of opportunity to prove the Dao for Chu Chengnan amidst the chaos.

Only with the mutual restraint among the three sects was there a possibility for a fish to pass through the net.

Even with such a meticulous layout, with True Person Qingyuan exchanging countless resources and exhausting all his efforts, and with a powerhouse like True Person Qingyuan providing protection, plus a once-in-a-millennium opportunity...

In the end, it still turned into nothingness under the thunderous strike of the Bodhisattva Zen's spiritual treasure, the Demon-Subduing Rung.

How dishonorable!

There is only one path to success, but cliffs of failure are everywhere.

And on this thorny and treacherous path of betrayal, the greatest trap is not the tribulations themselves, but the cold, condescending gaze from those who have already reached the summit.

They do not allow latercomers to share their power, to divide the already limited source of the 'Dao Fruit'.

The Heavenly Dao of the Taihua Lingxu World drives cultivators like giant rats to conquer other worlds, seeking fruit positions to strengthen the world's foundational Heavenly Dao. Yet the pinnacle existences among cultivators, the Golden Core True Persons, are doing everything they can to hold others back. Upon encountering a grotto-heaven still in its embryonic stage, they would not hesitate to absorb it into their own.

How ironic.

A profound sense of oppression enveloped Xu Yunfan.

He looked at the废掉 Chu Chengnan, and his mind filled with thoughts. Perhaps this was not the first proof-of-Dao aspirant to fall, and it would certainly not be the last.

As long as this world is still controlled by those mere dozen or so True Persons, and as long as the structure of the three great sects remains unshaken, any attempt to climb towards the 'Golden Core' will be like swimming against the current. At any moment, it could be swept into an abyss of eternal damnation by the towering waves named 'Man-made Tribulations'.

The Pure Yang Patriarch of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect was powerful, but other True Persons would not necessarily be happy to see someone who is not a direct disciple, and even carries the brand of the Primordial Origin, become a True Person.

The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land views all non-Buddhist cultivators as demonic evil and is thus a mortal enemy.

The internal strife within the Primordial Origin Sect is no less than that from external enemies.

The path seems to have been completely sealed off.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath. The intense impure evil energy pierced his lungs and organs, carrying a wildness of destruction and rebirth, but it was instantly refined by his powerful physical body, transforming into wisps of true essence.

In a desperate situation, true wisdom and courage are revealed.

The situation of oppression by the three great sects, while it blocks the smooth road, does not necessarily mean one cannot cleave a bloody path through the cracks.

Although Chu Chengnan is废掉, every detail of his failure, every instance of being targeted, and every force he endured...

All have become valuable lessons on Xu Yunfan's future path.

The earth-shattering strike that shattered the Dao Fruit with the spiritual treasure, the cold gazes of the True Persons scheming against each other, were all deeply imprinted in his heart.

"Golden Core..."

Xu Yunfan silently recited in his heart.

He looked at his own palm, where the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi flowed, and the Divine Thunder arcs flickered in and out of existence.

"To break this situation, there is only one way: to be stronger, faster, and more ruthless."
