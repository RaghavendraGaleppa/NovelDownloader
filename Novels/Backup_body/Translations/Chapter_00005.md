# Chapter 5: Undercurrents and Looming Peril!

The thirty-sixth book recorded insights into the foundational techniques of cultivating internal energy through organ nourishment, written eighteen years ago by an inner sect disciple named Wu Yong.

"Eighteen years ago, this cultivation manual secretly contained the 'Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison Suppression Art.'"

"Seventeen years ago, the 'Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison Suppression Art' was completely lost within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect."

"That inner sect disciple named Wu Yong back then—could he have been a spy sent by the Wuding Mountain faction?"

Li Zhengjing's expression shifted as he flipped open the cultivation manual.

*My name is Wu Yong. I entered the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect at eight years old. After five years as a menial laborer, I was promoted to the outer sect at thirteen. Four years later, I achieved the pinnacle of external martial arts and received the organ-nourishing internal energy cultivation method. It took me seventy-six days to cultivate a strand of internal energy, allowing me to ascend to the inner sect.*

*Today, I received an inner sect task to record my cultivation insights, hoping they may serve as inspiration for future disciples.*

...

Li Zhengjing read every word carefully, his thoughts focused on the golden page in his mind.

*Wuding Mountain—Mystical Character Selection Technique!*

The first number in Wu Yong's record was *eight*—meaning this was the eighth section of the Mystical Character Selection Technique!

"First line, take characters two, six, and nine!"

"Second line, take characters nine, seven, and six."

"Third line..."

Li Zhengjing scanned the text, frustrated that he had no brush to write with and was forbidden from copying. He could only memorize it silently, thinking, *The second character of the first line is 'name,' the sixth is 'year,' the ninth is 'feather'...*

He continued memorizing, character by character, until a voice interrupted him.

"Junior Brother Li, it's getting late. The library is closing."

Pei Ying smiled as he spoke. "I understand that reading the cultivation insights of our predecessors can be deeply inspiring, especially on your first visit. But moderation is key—there will be plenty of time in the future. Besides, everyone's path is different. Others' insights may not suit you, so discern wisely."

Li Zhengjing closed the book and placed it back on the shelf, smiling. "Forgive my enthusiasm, Senior Brother."

Pei Ying waved it off. "I was the same way at first—nothing to laugh at. Just don't forget, tonight at my place for a drink."

With that, he left, glancing at the bookshelf once before descending to the second floor of the library.

Li Zhengjing reluctantly looked at the book one last time before turning away, thinking, *I only managed to memorize less than two hundred characters this afternoon—likely not even thirty percent of the complete 'Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison Suppression Art.'*

He resolved to return the next day and headed downstairs, submitting to a search by Attendant Lin.

Attendant Fan had just finished searching Pei Ying and let him leave.

Pei Ying turned back with a smile. "I'll prepare the food. You can come over in about an hour."

Li Zhengjing nodded with a smile. After Attendant Lin finished searching him, he left the library.

Xie Guihai, watching from behind, frowned slightly at his retreating figure.

Once all disciples had been searched and left, the two attendants exchanged glances.

Attendant Fan produced a slip of paper. "Left by Pei Ying."

Attendant Lin took it and read, then murmured, "Sixth bookshelf, twelfth row, thirty-sixth book."

Attendant Fan checked the master catalog. "From eighteen years ago. Should we remove it?"

Attendant Lin shook his head. "The library is open to all. We can't remove every book he reads, can we? Besides, cultivation insights from eighteen years ago are outdated. If he wants to read them, all the better."

Attendant Fan hesitated. "What if he notices issues with his own cultivation method while reading others' insights?"

Attendant Lin scoffed. "He's only just begun learning organ-nourishing internal energy. He lacks the discernment and experience to spot problems. If you're so worried, you might as well consider whether he's some once-in-a-generation genius who can piece together a complete cultivation method from fragmented insights!"

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing had already returned to his courtyard. Eagerly, he took out a brush and recorded the hundred-plus characters he had memorized, lest he forget or misremember any.

Though fewer than two hundred characters—likely less than thirty percent of the complete method—they were enough for him to begin deciphering their mysteries.

Night deepened unnoticed until a knock came at his door.

Li Zhengjing opened it to find the fake medicine peddler standing there.

"Six jars, as promised. Sixty taels of silver."

"Bring ten more tomorrow."

Li Zhengjing acknowledged, paid, and then asked, "Do you know Pei Ying's background?"

---

Night had fallen in the attendants' quarters.

Chen Youyu, Attendant Lin, and others had gathered.

Five outer sect attendants stood, while the only one seated was the inner sect disciple—Chen Yang!

"Attendant Chen is my uncle, and the four of you are all retainers of the Chen clan. Today, I've called you here regarding that boy Li Zhengjing, who entered the sect with Yuan Zhengfeng's token," Chen Yang stated.

"Junior Nephew Chen, rest assured. A mere outer sect disciple—since you've personally given the order, we'll ensure he never rises again," Attendant Lin declared.

"For the past six months, Attendant Chen has had it out for him, but we never paid him much mind," Attendant Fan added with a smile. "If we'd wanted to act, we'd have buried him long ago."

"But now it's different. He's reached the pinnacle of external martial arts. Given time to cultivate internal energy, he'll become an inner sect disciple—a status no lower than ours!" Chen Yang's tone was calm. "What opportunities do you see moving forward?"

"The organ-nourishing internal energy method he's cultivating is flawed," Chen Youyu interjected softly. "He'll never produce internal energy, never ascend to the inner sect. In time, I can—"

"Fool! How dare you bring this up?"

With a *bang*, the table shattered!

Chen Yang's face turned icy as he withdrew his hand.

Previously, he had maintained a composed demeanor, but now his fury was uncontrollable.

At first, he had merely envied Chen Youyu for suppressing the boy and earning Elder Chen Zhu's favor. He had considered taking the boy's life to win the elder's approval—only to uncover this catastrophic scheme of tampering with cultivation methods!

"If not for your reckless, brainless meddling with the cultivation method, why would I be here in the outer sect, cleaning up your mess?"

Chen Yang's rage caused his aura to leak, freezing the floor within a ten-foot radius. The room's temperature plummeted.

"As outer sect attendants, suppressing a mere outer sect disciple is trivial!"

"Even if you'd buried him at any point in the past six months, I could have protected you! But instead of acting then, you chose this idiotic move now—utterly brainless!"

"Tampering with the organ-nourishing internal energy method in the library violates the sect's most fundamental rules—its unbreakable foundation!"

"If this gets out, everyone involved will be sent to the Soul-Severing Platform, their spirits annihilated, never to reincarnate!"

Chen Yang's voice was frigid. "You're all from the Chen clan. If this is exposed, even Elder Chen Zhu may suffer the consequences!"

Chen Youyu shuddered, his face turning deathly pale.

The other four attendants glared at him with fury.

This old fool had gathered them under Elder Chen Zhu's name to tamper with the cultivation method—but now it seemed he had acted alone, falsely invoking the elder's authority!

"This boy endured half a year of suppression in the outer sect yet still achieved the pinnacle of external martial arts. His talent is exceptional, his perseverance unmatched."

"Such a youth, gifted beyond measure—I've heard his name, Li Zhengjing, reached the Sect Master's desk the moment he received the organ-nourishing method!"

"A disciple already on the Sect Master's radar, achieving external mastery in half a year—if he fails to produce internal energy in three to five months, an inner sect elder will investigate!"

"By then, your tampering will be exposed."

"That's why you must silence him immediately—erase all traces!"

"No matter how talented an outer sect disciple is, once dead, he's dead. I'll handle the fallout. But the organ-nourishing method must be cleansed of all evidence!"

Chen Yang scanned the group. "A mere junior, insignificant as an ant—suppress him however you like, it's trivial! But tampering with the cultivation method? Were your brains kicked by a donkey?"

Chen Youyu's face twisted. "Then... perhaps we could give him a complete, unaltered organ-nourishing method?"

Chen Yang took a deep breath. "Uncle, it seems your brain wasn't kicked by a donkey—it was eaten by a dog! Years in the outer sect, bullying disciples, have made you forget the inner sect's rules?"

Chen Youyu fell silent, not daring to speak further.

The other attendants also bowed their heads.

"Give him a complete method so he can compare and realize his current one is flawed?"

"Even if he doesn't notice, after half a year of your suppression, he'll hold a grudge. Once he cultivates internal energy and ascends, he'll come for revenge!"

"Besides, suppressed yet reaching external mastery in half a year—imagine his potential in the inner sect!"

Chen Yang's rage was palpable. Were they not within the sect, he might have slain Chen Youyu on the spot and silenced the other four.

"But Junior Nephew, once he enters the inner sect, won't you be there to suppress him?" Attendant Zhou smiled. "Elder Chen sits high above, unconcerned with such an ant. With you handling him, even if he enters the inner sect, he'll never rise!"

"Zhou Shaojie, was your brain eaten by a dog too?"

Chen Yang flicked his sleeve. "Inner sect disciples of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect are truly nurtured by the sect—highly valued!"

"You bully outer sect disciples as you please, but in the inner sect, every punishment must be approved by the Enforcement Hall."

"Even inner sect elders can't suppress a disciple without cause!"

His gaze swept over them as if they were fools. He exhaled sharply, then turned to leave with a final remark.

"I'll arrange for assistance."

"Ensure he rests in peace before the inner sect examination."

"Otherwise, prepare your wills and hope for a peaceful death."

Silence fell, the atmosphere thickening.

The attendants' gazes at Chen Youyu turned hostile.

"Chen Youyu, what a masterstroke."

"For half a year, to curry favor with Elder Chen, you suppressed Li Zhengjing."

"We had no part in it, no grudge against him. His future means nothing to us! But now, posing as a Chen clansman under Elder Chen's name, you've dragged us into your mess."

"Tampering with the cultivation method binds us together. Now that we're all in this, should we call you 'fellow daoist'?"

"We serve the Chen clan under Elder Chen's guidance, not yours!"

Attendant Lin sneered and stormed out.

The other three attendants followed suit.

Chen Youyu couldn't defend himself. He had no choice but to accept the blame for "falsely invoking authority."

Glaring at the shattered table, he cursed inwardly, *Damn you, Chen Yang! Father-killing bastard! It was you who ordered me to gather them and tamper with the method in Elder Chen's name! Now you deny it and pin it all on me!*

Clenching his fists, he thought bitterly, *Chen Yang has prepared for exposure—he's washing his hands clean, forcing me to take the fall!*

"If this gets out, the sect will punish him as an uninvolved inner sect disciple. With Elder Chen's protection, he'll get three years at most."

"But I'm the mastermind—I'll face the Soul-Severing Platform!"

Chen Youyu felt utterly wronged. Chen Yang had invoked Elder Chen's name, leaving him no choice.

Now, Chen Yang had made him the scapegoat. If exposed, he alone would bear the consequences!

The thought of the Soul-Severing Platform—annihilation, body and soul—weighed heavily. He cursed again.

"Chen Yang, you father-killing bastard!"

Meanwhile, Chen Yang was already on his way back to the inner sect.

His expression was dark, his fury mounting.

"Chen Youyu dared to impersonate Elder Chen, using my name to gather the Chen retainers and tamper with the method?"

"If we don't silence Li Zhengjing soon, exposure will bring disaster!"

"Worse, Elder Chen's ties to the Chen clan weaken as his cultivation grows. If he learns his name was used for such a crime, he may abandon the clan entirely!"
