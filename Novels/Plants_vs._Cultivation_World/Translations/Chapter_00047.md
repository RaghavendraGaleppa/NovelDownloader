# Chapter 47: Mid Qi Refining Stage

Gu Mo's words silenced Yuan Niya's intended questions. It was true that the Minor Revitalization Technique was an exclusive spell for spirit farmers, but very few among them truly mastered it.

Among the five exclusive spells for spirit farmers, the Minor Revitalization Technique was the most difficult. It also represented a qualitative leap for the profession. Once mastered, a spirit farmer gained the ability to heal spiritual plants, allowing them to take on lucrative tasks involving the treatment of rare flora.

Such missions were highly rewarding, making this spell a significant income booster for spirit farmers.

Beyond healing plants, the Minor Revitalization Technique could also treat cultivators. Some expedition teams unable to find healers would recruit spirit farmers who had mastered this technique.

A spirit farmer proficient in the Minor Revitalization Technique could essentially leave their fields behind and pursue more profitable assignments.

From what Yuan Niya knew of Gu Mo, he had joined the Spirit Cultivation Hall less than two years ago. How could someone with supposedly inferior spiritual roots master such a technique already?

"Don't waste the Cleansing Technique's effects. I won't cast it a second time," Gu Mo reminded her as she stood stunned.

Snapping back to attention, Yuan Niya focused on her own priorities. Regardless of Gu Mo's circumstances, accelerating her meridian cleansing was crucial—it would determine whether she could secure a true disciple position in the future.

"Haah..."

When the Cleansing Technique's effects faded, Yuan Niya collapsed weakly, utterly exhausted. Her robes were soaked with sweat and dotted with bloodstains, yet her eyes shone with intense brightness.

The enhanced cleansing had worked remarkably well. After some rest, she would be ready to attempt her breakthrough.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, I owe you a debt for this!" she said solemnly after catching her breath. Without his help, she would have needed weeks of recovery—precious time she couldn't afford to lose in the cutthroat competition for true disciple status.

"Enough talk. Your padding's coming loose," Gu Mo waved her off, eager to avoid any compromising situations that might spark rumors.

"Ah!" Yuan Niya clutched her chest and fled in embarrassment.

While Yuan Niya departed to breakthrough, Gu Mo prepared for his own advancement—from early to mid Qi Refining stage.

A month passed without Yuan Niya's visit. She messaged via jade slip that she had successfully broken through and was consolidating her new realm.

"Time for my breakthrough," Gu Mo murmured, storing the jade slip. His meridian cleansing progress had caught up with his cultivation, and the fusion of his three minor cycles was complete. Now he needed to circulate the newly formed intermediate cycle—success would mark his official entry into the mid Qi Refining stage.

Preparing ten portions of Solar Essence as backup, Gu Mo began channeling his spiritual energy. The process went smoothly without any energy shortages—his foundation was three times stronger than peers at his level, and the Solar Essence stood ready to replenish any gaps.

Circulating an intermediate cycle took significantly longer than minor cycles, explaining why higher-level cultivators required extended meditation sessions. For his first attempt, Gu Mo proceeded with deliberate caution, spending a full day completing one circulation. The slow pace ensured perfection—speed mattered less than accuracy.

As the cycle completed, Gu Mo felt his spiritual energy surge through the newly established pathways. The roaring current began purifying his body and meridians—the signature meridian cleansing of a realm breakthrough.

This purification lasted six full hours, indicating his physique and spiritual energy would be six times stronger than typical newly-advanced mid-stage cultivators.

From triple strength at early stage to sixfold at mid-stage—the gap widened with each advancement. Gu Mo wondered if he might reach nine times the standard at late Qi Refining stage.

Such disparities were immense, yet true prodigies often surpassed even these margins. As the cultivation world said: "Sometimes the gap between people exceeds that between humans and dogs."

"Exhilarating!"

The breakthrough left Gu Mo feeling unprecedentedly powerful in both body and energy. His very aura had transformed—standing beside an ordinary mid-stage cultivator, the difference would be as stark as uncut jade beside a common rock.

Gu Mo was that luminous jade, though his spiritual roots remained a noticeable flaw. Yet with the Sunflower's assistance, even this weakness became negligible.

---

After acclimating to his new power, Gu Mo activated his Breath Concealment Art. His aura rapidly condensed, the extraordinary presence vanishing until he appeared as an ordinary first-level Qi Refining cultivator once more.

None could suspect that beneath this facade lay mid-stage strength.

With his breakthrough complete, Gu Mo could resume using Solar Essence to advance. Although now at mid-stage, he hadn't yet reached the fourth level—that would require initiating his fourth minor cycle.

During early stage, completing a minor cycle marked advancement to the next level. But at mid-stage, merely beginning the fourth minor cycle qualified as reaching fourth level—full completion wasn't required.

This change stemmed from the intermediate cycle now present in mid-stage cultivators, effectively advancing their standing by half a step.

The trade-off was that mid-stage cultivation required completing an intermediate cycle before initiating new minor cycles, significantly lengthening cultivation sessions and increasing difficulty. Yet the benefits far outweighed these challenges.

After adjusting his state, Gu Mo absorbed the ten unused Solar Essence portions. His expression then darkened—something was wrong with the essence.
