**Chapter 22: Han Li's Growth, The Cultivator**

Yu Zhitong yelled in a frenzy, "Mo Juren, you imbecile! Do you even know what reaching Qi Condensation Layer Six in two years means?!"

Of course, Han Zhen had actually taken four years to cultivate to Qi Condensation Layer Six. Merely relying on meditation to refine the scattered spiritual energy of heaven and earth was an astonishing cultivation speed in itself. Mo Juren felt like he had heard the funniest joke in the world: Han Zhen also possessed spiritual roots! This mediocre person he had always looked down upon also had spiritual roots! How unfair the heavens were!

Han Zhen, with his Qi Condensation Layer Six magic power, fully propelled the arrow. Its target was Yu Zhitong's nascent soul. As a Qi Condensation Layer Seven cultivator, only Yu Zhitong, capable of casting spells, posed the sole threat present. Mo Juren's thumb-sized nascent soul, merely grazed by the arrow, instantly vanished into thin air. Yu Zhitong, greatly startled and disoriented, quickly used his remaining meager magic power to cast a movement spell, narrowly avoiding a direct hit. However, the light orb still lost a third of its size, and the green light around it flickered unsteadily. He didn't even have enough magic power left to cast an illusion and escape. He realized that Han Zhen wasn't holding back; rather, he simply didn't know the Object Manipulation spell. But in his nascent soul's current state, any martial artist could destroy it. Yu Zhitong couldn't help but quickly beg for mercy, hoping that since he hadn't actively participated in the fight, his life might be spared.

All of these polar reversals happened in an instant. Han Li only came back to his senses then, looking at Han Zhen, who seemed like a divine soldier descending from the heavens. Upon closer thought, his cousin Han Zhen seemed to be hiding something from him. For instance, wasn't the timing of his appearance too coincidental? What exactly was the weapon that turned Doctor Mo into ashes? Yet, the fact of his rescue was undeniable. Han Li caressed the small beast-skin pouch on his chest, knowing he also harbored secrets. However, a rift had ultimately formed deep within him. The unconditional trust he once had for Han Zhen was now gone.

"Tell me about your relationship with Doctor Mo, and the full story of this matter," Han Zhen asked. Yu Zhitong knew Han Zhen was a killing god. He thought he might be able to gain Han Li's sympathy, but he found Han Li, who had just experienced a life-or-death situation, remarkably cold.

"If I tell you, will you spare me?" Yu Zhitong's nascent soul flickered with a dim green light. In his current state, neither of the two people before him could successfully seize his body.

"It depends on your sincerity."

"I was originally a..."

"Tell the truth!" A short sword appeared in Han Li's hand. It was the one Doctor Mo had previously confiscated along with the Five-Poison Water. Having just narrowly escaped death, Han Li's emotions were highly unstable. Yu Zhitong knew he had no choice but to cooperate honestly.

"I was originally a member of a cultivator family..." Yu Zhitong honestly recounted his origins, his grievances and past affections with Doctor Mo, and why he chose to abandon his enmity and cooperate with him. As for the plot against Han Li, it was entirely orchestrated by Doctor Mo because he was unwilling to seek help from Yu Zhitong's family. Han Zhen scoffed upon hearing this. How could an experienced old fox like Mo Juren accept such a proposal? Yu Zhitong also told the two of them the three iron rules of body possession in the cultivation world, explaining that he only entertained the idea of seizing a body as a last resort because he didn't want to be assimilated by Doctor Mo. After hearing all of this, Han Li finally understood what Doctor Mo meant by "inheriting his body." In short, Yu Zhitong's words shifted all blame away from himself, while also expressing intense hatred for Mo Juren.

"Mo Juren is merely a mortal, yet he dared to try and sit as equals with us cultivators, even calling us brothers! How preposterous! Even more despicable, he used vile methods to destroy my dharma body and even deluded himself into thinking he could step onto the immortal path—it's utterly delusional!" Yu Zhitong gnashed his teeth, his hatred for Doctor Mo evidently suppressed for a long time, now pouring out without reservation.

After hearing all this, Han Li finally understood what he had experienced over the past four years, and realized that he had unknowingly stepped into another world.

"But you two are different. You were born with spiritual roots, especially Brother Han Zhen, whose aptitude is extraordinary. It would truly be a pity to waste your time like this. Why not return with me to my family's ancestral land? With your talents, both of you would be sufficient to be accepted as personal disciples by my family's elders." Yu Zhitong's calculations were clear, even trying to forge connections. He didn't believe anyone could resist the temptation of becoming an immortal. However, he forgot that Han Li had just experienced a "benevolent master, filial disciple" incident, and the words "personal disciple" immediately ignited a killing intent within him.

"That's something to consider. Finally, I have one more question for you: How many layers does the Evergreen Arts have in total?" Han Zhen looked at Yu Zhitong's nascent soul with a slightly interested gaze and spoke softly.

"If I tell you, will you agree to my request?"

"Do you have a choice?" Han Li looked at Yu Zhitong's nascent soul with disgust.

Yu Zhitong was intimidated by Han Li's murderous gaze. He racked his brain, wondering what he had said to offend him, and could only answer honestly: "The Evergreen Arts has thirteen layers in total, but I only know the first eight. The book Mo Juren always had in his hand is hidden in that secret compartment over there."

Han Li quickly found the secret compartment in the stone chamber. Inside, there wasn't just a scroll with "Everlasting Scripture" written on its cover, but also some other strange items. Han Li finally understood why Doctor Mo had tirelessly pored over this book. It turned out Mo Juren had never given up hope, not fully believing Yu Zhitong's claims about spiritual roots, and had secretly tried to decipher the cultivation methods of the Evergreen Arts. Sure enough, as Yu Zhitong had said, it contained the incantations for the seventh and eighth layers of the Evergreen Arts, and not only that, but also several spells. This was what Han Zhen had always yearned for. Only by mastering spells could one truly be considered a novice cultivator who had stepped into the cultivation world.

Han Zhen quickly memorized the last two layers of the Evergreen Arts. He flipped to the final pages and indeed found several crude spells recorded there. The spells recorded on the final pages included "Fireball Spell," "Spirit Stabilizing Talisman," "Wind Riding Art," "Object Manipulation Spell," and "Heavenly Eye Spell"—five incantations in total. These spells didn't seem difficult to comprehend. Han Zhen felt that after a few more attempts, he should be able to cast the Fireball Spell. Han Zhen thought of Han Li, who had spent half a year studying just the Fireball Spell and still hadn't grasped its essence. He couldn't help but glance at Han Li with a strange look. Never mind, he would study it later, after they parted ways.

Han Li, however, misunderstood Han Zhen's intention. He suddenly pulled out the long tube, aimed it at Yu Zhitong's nascent soul, and sprayed the Five-Poison Water. However, without the earth mushroom flower added, this version of the poisonous water had no effect on the nascent soul. Only then did Yu Zhitong realize with a start that Han Li intended to kill him to silence him.

"Why won't you spare me!?" Yu Zhitong's nascent soul let out a venomous shriek. He truly couldn't understand why, after cooperating so much. Han Li, however, ignored him, thrusting the short sword like a venomous snake. Not long after, Han Li saw that he couldn't eradicate the last remnant of green light, and only then reluctantly withdrew his short sword.

"Do you really think I don't know that Doctor Mo was just a pawn you used to wear me down? Waiting for us both to be injured, so you could reap the benefits and be the profitable third party!"
