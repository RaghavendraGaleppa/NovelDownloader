# Chapter 75: The Choice  

Li Shiming learned from his identity jade slip that his residence was a single room on the second floor of the Qingqiu Pavilion.  

During the newcomer period, food was delivered daily by servant disciples. There were two types: ordinary mortal food and spirit food.  

The first task for newcomers was to follow the path beside the Qingqiu Pavilion to the Scripture Pavilion, several hundred meters away, to obtain their primary cultivation technique.  

Zhu Ji was questioning one of the newcomers, while others were either deep in thought or waiting their turn.  

Since Li Shiming didn’t need to change his primary cultivation technique, he saw no need to rush. Instead, he decided to visit the Scripture Pavilion first.  

With this thought, he left the Qingqiu Pavilion.  

Just as he was about to walk, he remembered the paper crane in his newly issued storage bag. He channeled spiritual energy into the bag.  

It was a one-cubic-meter storage bag—already quite generous.  

The generosity of the Tianhai Sect was evident. As long as one reached the first level of Qi Refinement, they would receive a storage bag.  

The reason it was given only after reaching the first level was that without spiritual energy, the newcomers wouldn’t be able to use it.  

Li Shiming took out the paper crane. Naturally, it was made of paper—high-quality talisman paper, to be precise. However, the crane wasn’t a talisman but rather a tool similar to a magical artifact, used for transportation.  

He infused a trace of spiritual energy into the crane, which immediately enlarged and hovered before him.  

This energy established a faint spiritual connection between him and the crane, allowing him to control it with his mind.  

He mounted the crane, which dipped slightly under his weight before stabilizing.  

To be honest, the paper crane wasn’t particularly comfortable to sit on. Its paper construction made him feel like it might break at any moment.  

But he knew this worry was unfounded. With the runic formations embedded in it, even mortal swords and weapons couldn’t harm the crane.  

The crane soared into the air. Not daring to fly recklessly here, he steered it toward the Scripture Pavilion.  

*"Riding alone on an aged crane descending from the Jade Terrace,  
Immortal robes fluttering as it arrives from the summit.  
When will the prince pass by Gou Ridge again?  
A single flute melody heralds the dawn clouds parting."*  

While riding the flying boat earlier, Li Shiming hadn’t felt it as deeply. But now, atop the paper crane, he truly experienced the transcendent freedom of a cultivator, unbound by the constraints of nature.  

Unfortunately, the journey was too short. After only a brief moment of enjoyment, he arrived at the entrance of the Scripture Pavilion.  

Dismounting, he willed the crane to shrink back to its miniature form and returned it to his storage bag.  

Entering the Scripture Pavilion, he found it different from what he had imagined. At least on the first floor, there were no bookshelves in sight.  

"Identity jade slip, please. What technique are you here to obtain?" A cultivator in Qi Refinement robes asked casually.  

---  

Li Shiming noticed a plaque on the cultivator’s chest that read "Scripture Pavilion." Presumably, this was the sect member assigned to manage the pavilion.  

He handed over his jade slip, which the cultivator placed under a formation.  

"As a newcomer, you’re entitled to one free Qi Refinement technique," the cultivator said, then gave Li Shiming a surprised look before continuing, "You also have a sect reward—an additional free Qi Refinement combat skill!"  

Li Shiming had been wondering about the promised reward. So this was where it came into play.  

He didn’t know the exact value of a free combat skill, but a reward was a reward, and he wasn’t in a position to be picky.  

"I’d like to ask for recommendations on good body-refining techniques," Li Shiming said, discreetly sliding five spirit stones across the counter.  

Having worked in his previous life, he understood human nature. While the two worlds were different, social customs remained similar.  

Though he could have asked Zhu Ji about body-refining techniques, Li Shiming trusted that the Scripture Pavilion’s staff would have more comprehensive knowledge.  

"So, you already have a primary cultivation technique. Call me Senior Brother Liu," the cultivator said, smoothly pocketing the spirit stones with a smile. "Body-refining techniques are expensive, so using your free newcomer quota on one is a smart move. What elemental affinity are you looking for? That’ll help me narrow it down."  

"What options are there for metal-attribute body-refining techniques?" Li Shiming asked eagerly.  

"The Scripture Pavilion has several metal-attribute body-refining techniques," Senior Brother Liu began, now quite talkative after receiving the spirit stones.  

"*Diamond Guardian Divine Art* is a Buddhist body-refining technique. However, those bald monks’ methods require a foundation in Buddhist philosophy, making it difficult to master without prior study. That said, Buddhist techniques tend to have grandiose names but deliver impressive results.  

*Bronze Body Method* is a modified version of corpse-refining techniques. It uses various toxins to strengthen the body. Once mastered, it provides exceptional defense and even grants some toxic properties. But let’s just say you won’t be finding a cultivation partner afterward!  

*Dragon Elephant Mystic Art* is a Daoist body-refining technique. It demands vast quantities of rare medicinal herbs but, once perfected, is said to grant the strength of a dragon and an elephant. It’s on par with the *Diamond Guardian Divine Art* as a top-tier body-refining method."  

Li Shiming hesitated. Though Senior Brother Liu had dismissed the *Diamond Guardian Divine Art*, his tone suggested he held it in high regard.  

As for the *Bronze Body Method*, Li Shiming wouldn’t even consider it. Cultivation wasn’t about turning oneself into some grotesque, toxic monstrosity.  

The *Dragon Elephant Mystic Art* was highly praised by Senior Brother Liu, indicating its excellence.  

But the issue was resources. The technique required vast amounts of rare medicinal herbs. Even with his skills as a spirit farmer, he couldn’t guarantee a steady supply.  

Moreover, practicing the *Dragon Elephant Mystic Art* would signal to other cultivators that he possessed abundant rare resources—a risk that outweighed the defensive benefits.  

"Senior Brother Liu, I’d like the *Diamond Guardian Divine Art*, please," Li Shiming finally decided, speaking politely.  

Senior Brother Liu smiled but offered no further advice. The choice of techniques was a personal matter, crucial to a cultivator’s future path. He wouldn’t dare influence such a decision.  

Besides, even if Li Shiming made a mistake, it was only a body-refining technique—not his primary cultivation method.  

Senior Brother Liu retrieved a jade slip and placed it into the formation. A beam of light transmitted information into the slip.  

"Since you’re still in the newcomer period, the jade slip is also free. The sect’s *Diamond Guardian Divine Art* only covers up to the Foundation Establishment stage. What’s being copied for you now is the Qi Refinement portion.  

Remember the sect’s rules: sharing techniques privately is forbidden. Violators face severe punishment—expulsion at best, execution at worst," Senior Brother Liu warned sternly as the transmission continued.  

Li Shiming watched the jade slip intently, using his heightened senses to memorize the process of the formation transmitting data.  

He wasn’t sure if this observation would prove useful, but it was a rare opportunity. Perhaps in the future, when his strength grew, he could delve deeper into the mysteries of jade slip technology.
