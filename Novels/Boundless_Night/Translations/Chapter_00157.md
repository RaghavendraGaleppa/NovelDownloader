**Chapter 157: The Ambition to Blaze a Trail**

In the stone chamber, Qin Ming was half-asleep, half-awake, when he vaguely saw a towering figure in the depths of the night mist. The light of his spirit actually seemed on the verge of dissipating!

He jolted awake, sitting up. He felt unsteady and quite weary; just a fleeting glimpse had caused him such pressure. He calmed his mind and focused, circulating the *Fate-Changing Scripture* to enhance the vitality of his flesh and blood, nourishing his essence, qi, and spirit. Moments later, he had fully recovered, no longer feeling fatigued.

"How bizarre, as if my consciousness left my body and drifted far away with the mist. I actually witnessed such an anomalous sight, seemingly real yet illusory." Qin Ming pondered, "One was Lu Zizai, so the other must be the Six Supremacies Ancestor, right?" At the same time, he found the *River Vein Scripture* extremely interesting. A top-tier wondrous art was like a gold mine that could be continuously excavated, always yielding new surprises.

Qin Ming consolidated his understanding of the *River Vein Scripture* in the quiet chamber. Acquiring the fifth wondrous art and cultivating Heavenly Light Energy from it filled him with a sense of joy and satisfaction.

Soon after, he emerged from the stone cave, breathing in the fresh air. In recent days, Lu Zizai would appear nearby at this time, strolling through the enlightenment ground, as if contemplating something, or perhaps reminiscing before his imminent departure.

"How is your comprehension of the *River Vein Scripture* coming along?" Lu Zizai appeared again, standing by the bamboo grove as he asked. He recalled how, back in the day, he had fully mastered it within five or six days, quickly cultivating River Vein Energy, astonishing everyone around him. Those scenes felt like just yesterday.

"Actually, it's not very difficult. Compared to some secret scriptures, it's relatively easy to get started with," Lu Zizai said.

Qin Ming nodded, "Senior Brother Lu is right; I feel the same way."

"Then how much have you understood?" Lu Zizai asked with a smile.

Qin Ming replied, "I've cultivated all the chapters from the nascent stage and parts of the scriptures from the Outer Sage realm that I could comprehend."

Lu Zizai paused, "How many days has it been?"

"Four days," Qin Ming responded. Then, a soft Heavenly Light Energy appeared in his palm, accompanied by swirling mist. Next, he drew the nearby fire spring into his hand, the vermillion clouds and mist coiling around it like a burning cloud.

"Four days?" Lu Zizai was lost in thought. This was faster than his own record from back then. Could this "junior brother" he just met be so formidable? He had thought his record would be hard to break, at least within the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court, yet he had personally witnessed a latecomer take even less time.

After a slight daze, Lu Zizai nodded, "Not bad. In the future, you will be one of us."

A group of elders stood guard from a distance, not daring to peek. Only the Grand Disciple of the Young Ancestor stood closer, inadvertently overhearing this remark. Immediately, he was shocked! How many people on the Newborn Path in this world could receive such an evaluation?

"W-what's wrong?" Zhou Tao noticed the hunched figure in front of him tremble and thought something had gone awry. The Grand Disciple of the Young Ancestor walked back, trembling, his hair so sparse it was negligible. He sighed, "It's ancestral-level talent."

...

"Senior Brother Lu, can I learn the *World Fire* true art now?" Qin Ming asked, his eyes gleaming with brilliant light.

Lu Zizai's expression was somewhat complex. Looking at the young man before him, he seemed to see his past self: such high aptitude, and so eager to learn. Soon, he smiled again. *He* was now an eighteen-year-old boy!

"Your comprehension is extraordinary; I will teach you the World Fire Refining True Art."

Qin Ming listened attentively, then returned to the quiet chamber to silently comprehend. This scripture was indeed difficult; he hadn't fully sorted it out yet, and some details could only be intuitively grasped, not verbally explained. He needed to navigate the misty zone himself.

"Hurry up and comprehend it. If you don't understand anything, ask me immediately. I might have to make a run for it in the next few days," Lu Zizai said. He was quite direct, speaking such words without concealment even within the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court.

"Are you leaving or staying?" Lu Zizai asked.

Qin Ming naturally wanted to leave too. If such a powerful figure was running away, what was he still doing here? However, he felt somewhat indebted to the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court. He had learned their wondrous arts, and he now knew that the "strange medicine" he had gathered might have had an owner. Would the elders agree if he just left like that?

Lu Zizai said, "If you feel you owe the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court, just repay them later."

"Alright!" Qin Ming nodded, then asked some questions about *World Fire*. The scripture wasn't long, but it was profoundly esoteric. It was mysterious and contained infinite wondrous uses, allowing one to gain insight into anything, like gauging one's compatibility with cultivation methods.

Several days later, Qin Ming felt that even with the remaining mysteries in this true art, he could now explore it on his own and navigate the inexpressible misty areas. Lu Zizai began packing his belongings, preparing to leave the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court.

"Senior Brother Lu, where are you going?"

"To roll around in the mundane world, and then, most likely, I'll head into the depths of the Night Mist World to explore the Newborn Path."

Without a doubt, Lu Zizai had the ambition to blaze a trail!

"Dong..." A melodious bell rang through the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court, summoning the young disciples.

"Not leaving for now." The fleeing Lu Zizai had actually returned, seemingly displeased. He paced back and forth in the enlightenment ground.

Qin Ming walked out of the quiet chamber, "Senior Brother Lu, what happened?"

"People from the Outer Lands came to visit. I'm very dissatisfied with them." Such was his true nature—ethereal in demeanor, yet extremely direct in speech.

"What's wrong?" Qin Ming knew something must have happened.

Lu Zizai said, "Someone from the Outer Lands brought their disciples for a sparring match."

Qin Ming was unfazed, "What's the big deal? The early Six Supremacies Energy is best suited for fighting those from the Outer Lands. Heavenly Light is like the great sun; it can burn their spiritual light." There was a reason why several legendary energy techniques made the Outer Lands and the Esoteric Sect wary, especially in the first two realms, where they seemed to be particularly effective against them. As for other Heavenly Light Energies, they were hard to describe, often severely suppressed by the Outer Lands and Esoteric Sect's methods.

"The key is, they want to use our methods against us," Lu Zizai said with dissatisfaction.

Qin Ming was astonished, "You mean, Newborn Path methods?"

"It is said that some old geezers from the Outer Lands have developed incredible cultivation methods, or some say they're lost energy techniques from our Newborn Path that fell into their hands." Lu Zizai frowned. The people from the Outer Lands were clearly testing their methods, and this time, someone led the team, making the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court their first target. They claimed it was for sparring and exchange, but they definitely wanted a true contest. Without certain confidence, how would they dare to visit? If the disciples of the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court were suppressed by the Outer Lands people in their own home, it would be a huge joke.

"Are they really high-level cultivation methods researched by the big figures of the Outer Lands?" Qin Ming asked. If so, that would be too formidable.

Lu Zizai shook his head, "Definitely not; it's not the same path at all. How could they casually create methods? Eight times out of ten, they obtained cultivation methods left by an ancestral master of the Newborn Path who met with an accident, such as the *Heaven-Severing Strategy*, or the *Eight Scenery Divine Illumination Scripture*, which hasn't appeared for a long time." Although he felt the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court was decaying and hoped for its renewal, he didn't want outsiders to challenge them in such a manner, especially while he was still present.

"There shouldn't be much of a problem, right?" Qin Ming thought the outliers cultivated by the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court would be enough to handle the situation.

Lu Zizai said, "Don't underestimate the Outer Lands. They have methods to improve the foundation of Newborns. Even ancestral masters of the Newborn Path once used their methods to strengthen their own foundations." Moreover, he had already learned that the Outer Lands had put significant effort into cultivating a top-tier outlier this time! If that person also possessed a Heavenly Light Energy no weaker than the legendary Six Supremacies Energy, then the outcome of the match would indeed be hard to predict.

Lu Zizai said, "Although the talent cultivation of the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court is not what it used to be, I reckon they can handle it. But I don't want the Outer Lands people to win even a single match." Because the opponent was challenging them using Newborn Path methods, their intentions were malicious.

"You go and fight. Don't give them a single chance. Sweep them away like withered leaves, completely defeat them all!" Lu Zizai instructed.

"Alright, no problem!" Qin Ming immediately nodded. He had received many benefits from the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court and was just wondering how to repay this karma. As it turned out, before he even left, he had an opportunity to flex his muscles.

"Senior Brother Lu, you must help me disguise my true appearance. I'm worried there might be problems afterward."

"Don't worry, that's definitely been considered," Lu Zizai nodded.

Soon, Qin Ming learned that the visitors were from the Outer Lands Immortal Earth. It was said that several old seniors had researched a scripture called the *Immortal Boxing Scripture*. Moreover, the people of the Outer Lands Immortal Earth privately believed that the Heavenly Light Energy cultivated from this scripture was definitely no weaker than Tathagata Energy or Jade Purity Energy.

"This scripture has quite a resounding name," Qin Ming showed a look of surprise.

"It's definitely a scripture left behind by a fallen ancestral master of the Newborn Path, which they have repackaged and brought out," Lu Zizai stated with absolute certainty.

The sparring was set for tomorrow. The people from the Outer Lands Immortal Earth mentioned that after their friendly exchange with the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court, they would also visit the Jade Purity Sect, the Tathagata Gate, and other places, paying respects one by one.

Lu Zizai was even more displeased. Were they planning to challenge the strongest dao lineages of the Newborn Path one by one? He instructed, "Hit them hard. It doesn't matter. I want them to eat their words. After this battle, they should all go back to the Immortal Earth to recuperate."

Qin Ming replied, "Okay, no problem. Senior Brother Lu, I want to use the *River Vein Scripture*, but this Heavenly Light Energy hasn't reached great completion yet..." He had originally wanted to ask if there were any "fallen fruits" here, so he could quickly integrate the energy techniques.

Lu Zizai said, "You have five wondrous arts, each belonging to one of the Five Elements. You can completely rotate the Five Elements now, temporarily converting one of them into the Water Element. It shouldn't be too difficult."

"I can do that? I'll give it a try!" Qin Ming became interested, pushing the matter of "fallen fruits" to the back of his mind.

That day, while walking with Lu Zizai in the Six Supremacies Ancestral Court, he unexpectedly spotted a familiar face in the crowd—one of the guests from the Immortal Earth this time. She was a young girl in white, not one of the outliers scheduled to fight, but a member of the accompanying observation team.

Lu Zizai understood, "That small group of people should be the newly promoted core disciples of the Outer Lands Immortal Earth. They want to observe various methods of our path through the battles between top-tier outliers."

Qin Ming was surprised; she had actually become a core disciple of the Outer Lands Immortal Earth today. He recalled encountering two women by the fire spring in Twin Tree Village back then. The green-robed woman among them had once stood on the back of a Golden Roc and seized the greatest fortune of Black and White Mountain, and now the white-robed girl beside her had achieved such status.
