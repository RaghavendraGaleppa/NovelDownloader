# Chapter 81: Sword-Nurturing Gourd and Spiritual Energy Transformation

**Spirit Fish King**

Upon hearing Wang Jinsong's words, Zhang Yan gazed longingly at the deep pool. These spirit fish were truly remarkable treasures. Unfortunately, they couldn't be bred or casually hunted.

"Alright, now that we've eaten, let's head back," Wang Jinsong said after finishing the spirit fish, leading Zhang Yan and the others back to their base to begin formal cultivation.

However, due to Zhang Yan's low cultivation level, he couldn't train with his senior brothers. Instead, he was summoned by the Grandmaster to her thatched cottage.

"Sit," the Grandmaster said, her voice cool and her expression unreadable.

"Yes," Zhang Yan replied respectfully, quickly taking a seat opposite her.

"I recall Changqing mentioned your exceptional comprehension—four mastered spells, was it? Which ones?" the Grandmaster inquired softly.

"Water Element Art, Wood Element Art, Lightness Art, and Rain Summoning Art," Zhang Yan answered without hesitation.

In truth, he had mastered more than just those—there was also Transplanting Flowers to Trees and the Golden Grass Pheasant Sword. The former had reached mastery through the spiritual hoe's innate ability, requiring only time to perfect. The latter, being his first offensive spell since beginning cultivation, had also reached mastery after prolonged practice.

"All supportive spells," the Grandmaster mused, slightly furrowing her brow. It was somewhat impressive, but Zhang Yan reminded himself not to overstep—this was the Grandmaster, after all!

"Do you wish to become a production-type cultivator?" the Grandmaster asked, studying him.

"Yes. But I'd also like to learn some self-defense techniques," Zhang Yan nodded. In truth, he aspired to be more than just a production-type cultivator—he aimed to be an all-rounder.

With his Equipment Panel, whether it was combat techniques or production skills, his progress would far surpass others'. As an adult, he saw no reason to limit himself.

"Good. A cultivator solely focused on production is inherently weaker. If one can only generate resources without the means to protect themselves, all their efforts merely serve others," the Grandmaster said sternly, a sentiment Zhang Yan wholeheartedly agreed with.

This principle wasn't unique to the cultivation world—it had been an eternal truth in his past life as well. As the saying went: *You stockpile grain, I stockpile guns—your home becomes my granary.*

"Please guide me, Grandmaster!" Zhang Yan eagerly sought her wisdom.

"Among the myriad cultivation methods, few excel in combat as much as sword cultivation. Would you be willing to learn?" the Grandmaster proposed.

**Sword Cultivation**

"Sword cultivation? This disciple is willing!" Zhang Yan immediately bowed deeply. This was a tactic—when a superior spoke, one should show immediate loyalty. The specifics were secondary.

"Very well. You may try learning it. Come to me if you have questions. Your current cultivation is far too low—you must reach Foundation Establishment soon," the Grandmaster added, clearly dissatisfied with his progress.

Zhang Yan could only sigh inwardly. Although his spiritual roots had improved once, his cultivation time was still far shorter than his seniors'. Slower progress was inevitable.

*Perhaps I should leverage the sect's resources to gather spiritual materials,* he suddenly thought. The sect's power far exceeded his own, and as a true disciple, he could mobilize some of its resources. If similar treasures were available, he might receive priority allocation.

As he pondered, the Grandmaster tossed him a gourd-like object.

"This is..."

**[Equipment Name]:** Sword-Nurturing Gourd  
**[Equipment Tier]:** Low-grade Spiritual Artifact  
**[Equipment Quality]:** Blue  
**[Equipment Effects]:** Sword Qi (Lv. 2), Divine Ability: Spiritual Energy Transformation (Great Mastery), Sword-Nurturing Art (Perfection).

"This Sword-Nurturing Gourd is a trinket I no longer use. Though it's a spiritual artifact, even a Qi Refining cultivator can wield it. It's essentially an accessory to the Sword-Nurturing Art. Once you master the art, you can condense your spiritual energy into sword Qi stored within the gourd. The longer it's nurtured, the more powerful it becomes—capable of surpassing your current realm by one minor stage," the Grandmaster explained, then tapped his forehead, transferring the Sword-Nurturing Art directly into his mind.

"Thank you, Grandmaster!" Zhang Yan bowed deeply.

"Go now," she dismissed him with a wave.

Returning to his quarters, Zhang Yan laid out the Sword-Nurturing Gourd and the Thunderflame Token. He needed to master both the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art and the gourd's techniques while also advancing his cultivation.

He also needed to acquire the Metal and Earth Element Arts. The list of tasks was long, but none could be neglected. The elemental arts were foundational, while the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art was crucial for both artifact forging and Foundation Establishment.

Foundation Establishment required mastery over three pillars: essence, energy, and spirit. Energy—his pure Yang童子功 ensured flawless spiritual energy. Spirit—his enhanced consciousness, bolstered by spiritual tea and the Clearheart Lotus, was impeccable. Essence, however, referred to physical vitality. Without a robust body, the tribulation of Foundation Establishment could prove fatal. Hence, most cultivators tempered their bodies or consumed vitality-enhancing elixirs.

As for the Sword-Nurturing Art, it was a formidable trump card, far surpassing his Golden Grass Pheasant Sword. While he could enhance the latter's power through inscriptions, its base potential was limited—like trying to turn a pistol into a missile. The Sword-Nurturing Art, however, was that missile, growing stronger with time.

**Thunderflame Body Tempering Art**

Zhang Yan began with the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art. Typically, this art required harnessing natural lightning during storms—a perilous process demanding supervision. But the Thunderflame Token's innate lightning attribute allowed him to summon controlled bolts at will, granting him a unique advantage.

Crackling energy erupted from the token, searing through his body. "Agh—so painful!" he gasped. The intensity was staggering—far exceeding ordinary spells. Yet, with his ample spiritual energy, he gradually subdued the lightning, using it to temper his flesh.

Each session was meticulously controlled, avoiding excess. Compared to those who relied on unpredictable natural lightning and restorative pills, his progress was exponentially faster.

After his first session, Zhang Yan marveled at the results—his physical strength had increased by over ten percent. However, the exertion left him ravenous. He consumed restorative pills to alleviate the hunger, though he missed having the silly bird around to test them first.

**Sword-Nurturing Art**

Next, Zhang Yan turned to the Sword-Nurturing Art. It was an unusual technique, requiring the specialized gourd to function. The art involved condensing all his spiritual energy into a single strand of sword Qi, stored within the gourd for continuous enhancement.

The gourd also housed a divine ability—Spiritual Energy Transformation. Curious, Zhang Yan equipped the gourd and activated the ability. A miniature flying sword materialized in his palm, formed entirely of spiritual energy. Despite its ethereal nature, its potency was undeniable—especially after being nurtured by the gourd.

"And... even though it's smaller, it feels more practical," Zhang Yan mused, smiling at the shimmering blade.
