# Chapter 15: All Part of the Act  

Flames surged like a raging sea.  

Terrifying waves of heat swept in all directions as thick black smoke billowed into the sky.  

Under the glow of the crimson firelight, Dou Changsheng could clearly see the one-armed martial artist at the center of the group, standing in the spotlight, his imposing aura overwhelming.  

Dou Changsheng’s heart leaped into his throat—his bluff hadn’t worked. The enemy hadn’t fallen for it at all.  

Just as despair settled in and he was certain death was inevitable, the situation took an unexpected turn.  

This formidable foe, this great adversary, had actually been killed by his own allies.  

Dou Changsheng was stunned. His emotions had been on a rollercoaster, soaring and plummeting—it was utterly thrilling.  

So much so that he remained frozen in place, unable to react for a long moment.  

And in that brief lapse of attention, Dou Changsheng suddenly realized that of the few who had emerged from the flames, only Feng Zhongyi remained alive.  

The other accompanying martial artists had all been ruthlessly slain by the flexible sword in Feng Zhongyi’s hand.  

Feng Zhongyi, peerless in lightness techniques, moved with lightning speed. After killing them, he tossed their bodies into the fire, reducing them to charred remains and erasing all traces.  

The entire sequence of actions had been executed in the blink of an eye.  

The slain martial artists had naturally resisted when Feng Zhongyi turned on them, but by the time Dou Changsheng focused his attention forward, everything was already over.  

Feng Zhongyi slowly sheathed his flexible sword, took two steps forward, and spoke solemnly, “I may not be a good man, but I still hold righteousness in my heart.”  

“I understand the distinction between our people and the barbarians. If the military provisions were truly seized and the Sword Gate Pass opened to let the northern tribes invade, the land would be plunged into chaos. The northern territories would fall into ruin, tainted by savagery, and our people would be ruled by uncivilized outsiders. No one with a shred of conscience could tolerate such a thing.”  

“I’ve long wanted to pledge my loyalty to the Shogunate, but I never found the right opportunity.”  

“By heaven’s mercy, I’ve finally been given the chance to abandon the darkness and embrace the light.”  

Dou Changsheng watched as Feng Zhongyi bowed deeply with genuine sincerity. He sighed softly, then turned and left without responding. He knew that the more he said, the more mistakes he might make—silence was the safer choice.  

After all, Dou Changsheng wasn’t so arrogant as to think Feng Zhongyi was some pushover he could trample at will.  

Even as he walked away, Dou Changsheng remained on high alert, wary of Feng Zhongyi following the same playbook and stabbing him in the back.  

A sword through the back, a heroic death.  

Only when he had disappeared into the darkness without any movement behind him did Dou Changsheng finally relax slightly. Still, he didn’t dare look back, afraid Feng Zhongyi might suddenly call out, “Still here, buddy!”  

---  

Feng Zhongyi’s sharp gaze remained fixed on Dou Changsheng’s retreating figure until it was completely swallowed by the darkness.  

He stood motionless for a long while before the solemn expression on his face gradually faded. He quickly stepped forward to the corpse of Long Ying, reached out to help him up, and asked with concern, “My lord!”  

“Are you all right?”  

Long Ying’s eyelids fluttered as he slowly opened his eyes and exhaled deeply. His chest, which had been unnaturally still, began to rise and fall again—as if his heart had stopped beating and only now resumed.  

Long Ying didn’t speak immediately. After waiting for about a dozen breaths, he exhaled again and said slowly, “I’m getting old.”  

“Truly old.”  

“Holding my breath and slowing my heartbeat isn’t as easy as it was in my youth.”  

“It seems all these years of smooth sailing have dulled my old skills of feigning death.”  

“This is a profound lesson—one I must take to heart.”  

Long Ying gradually stood up, stretching his back before finally feeling more comfortable. He then reached behind and tore off a broken blood pouch, tossing it to the ground. As he wiped his hands and body with a handkerchief, he said, “Your acting was excellent. For a moment, I really thought you were going to kill me.”  

Feng Zhongyi hurriedly explained, “My lord misunderstands.”  

“This subordinate wouldn’t dare lay a hand on you.”  

“Had you not planned this in advance, I wouldn’t have dared entertain such thoughts, even with a thousand lives to spare.”  

Long Ying laughed heartily and patted Feng Zhongyi’s shoulder. “I believe you.”  

*I believe you—if you had confirmed he was a grandmaster, you would’ve struck without hesitation.*  

His gaze grew profound as he stared at the raging flames. With a sigh, he said, “Our failure to guard the provisions will surely bring the Grandmaster’s wrath upon our return.”  

Feng Zhongyi replied firmly, “My lord need not worry.”  

“The Shogunate sent a grandmaster—how could we possibly resist?”  

“This subordinate witnessed everything clearly.”  

“My lord raised your whip, and it cut through the air like a shooting star, its crack like divine thunder, shaking the heavens. A single strike could shatter stone and split mountains.”  

“Yet the enemy deflected it effortlessly.”  

Long Ying shook his head. “Wrong.”  

“If we had truly attacked a grandmaster of pure Yin, none of us would be alive now.”  

“From beginning to end today, we never saw Dou Changsheng, nor did we encounter a grandmaster.”  

“There were only traitors among us, setting fires everywhere. We were forced to retreat due to the flames.”  

Feng Zhongyi nodded in understanding. “My lord is wise.”  

“The matter of the grandmaster lacks concrete evidence and won’t convince the Grandmaster. But once he investigates thoroughly, he’ll uncover traces of a grandmaster’s presence. Then we’ll be in the clear.”  

“After all, the ones imprisoned this time were mere nobodies—no big fish among them.”  

Long Ying sighed. “In my younger days, I was stubborn and refused to yield until I hit a wall. But losing this arm taught me that the world isn’t just about brute force.”  

“As you said, what would killing Dou Changsheng gain us?”  

“Even under my intimidation, he didn’t panic or reveal any weaknesses—proof that he had something to rely on. Even if he wasn’t possessed by a grandmaster, he surely had other hidden cards.”  

“If he had the military provisions, it might’ve been worth the risk. The rewards from the Grandmaster would’ve allowed us to flee to another kingdom, beyond the reach of the Xiangzhou Wang Clan.”  

“But Dou Changsheng had nothing. Taking such a risk wouldn’t have been worth it.”  

Feng Zhongyi agreed. “My lord speaks wisely.”  

“There was an eighty percent chance Dou Changsheng was bluffing, but twenty percent was real.”  

“I deliberately slowed my attack to test him, but I couldn’t discern anything.”  

“So I stuck to the plan. The cost was negligible, yet it ensured our survival. Far better than gambling our lives against a possible grandmaster or a noble scion with hidden cards.”  

“Meeting you today, my lord, has shown me the light.”  

“I hope you’ll continue to guide me in the future.”  

“As for this skill of feigning death… might this humble subordinate learn it?”  

“Life as a rogue cultivator is too perilous. With such a technique, I’d feel much safer.”
