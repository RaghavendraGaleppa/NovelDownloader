**Chapter 50: The Greatest Advantage**  

Perhaps to save costs—or for other reasons—the senior brother from Hundred Arrays Peak didn’t give Zhang Yan a new formation disk but a used one.  

As a result, it still carried its original attributes:  

**[Equipment Name]**: Spirit Plant Formation Disk  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Green  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- **Basic Array Comprehension** (You have a preliminary understanding of formations.)  
- **Array Control** (Formations you manipulate suffer reduced energy loss and increased effectiveness.)  

Looking at these attributes, Zhang Yan was deeply moved. This senior brother was far too generous—he had only asked for a formation, yet the senior had practically handed him his livelihood.  

*"Junior Brother, do you not like this formation disk? I only brought one today. If you think it’s too old, I can go back and get you a new one."*  

The senior brother felt uneasy under Zhang Yan’s intense gaze and cautiously asked.  

*"No, no! I prefer second-hand ones!"*  

The moment the senior mentioned replacing it, Zhang Yan’s joyful expression stiffened. How could he let such a treasure slip away? He immediately refused with righteous indignation.  

*"As long as you’re satisfied, Junior Brother."*  

The senior brother could only conclude that Zhang Yan had some peculiar tastes. Who in their right mind preferred used items?  

*"I’m never coming back to set up formations for him again."*  

With that thought, the senior brother turned and left.  

Zhang Yan, of course, had no idea what the senior was thinking. Right now, he was immersed in the joy of acquiring both the formation disk and the spirit herb garden.  

Though he had known nothing about formations before, from this moment on, he could confidently declare that he, Zhang Yan, had achieved a modest mastery of the art.  

Ah, the life of a cheater was just this simple and unpretentious.  

As for the spirit herb garden...  

*"Running the formation for such a large garden will consume a considerable amount of spirit stones daily. So unless absolutely necessary, I should avoid activating it."*  

Formations required spiritual energy to operate, and that energy didn’t come from nowhere—it had to be replenished with spirit stones.  

Of course, if he had access to a spirit vein, he could draw energy directly from it. Unfortunately, Qingheng Sect’s third-grade spirit vein was the foundation of the entire sect. It was allocated to the Golden Core elders for cultivation and powered the sect’s grand protective formation. Ordinary disciples were strictly forbidden from siphoning energy from it, and the consequences for violating this rule were severe.  

Zhang Yan had no intention of courting such trouble.  

Instead, he turned his attention to what kind of spirit herbs he should plant. Earlier, he had asked Elder Liu to collect some seeds for him. Most were for first-grade mid-tier spirit herbs, with a few upper-tier ones mixed in. Lower-tier seeds were almost nonexistent.  

Choosing the right grade of spirit herbs was crucial.  

First, they couldn’t be too high-grade. While higher-grade herbs fetched better prices, they also took much longer to mature. Zhang Yan was only at the early Qi Refining stage—his lifespan was limited, and he was at a phase where rapid progress was essential.  

He needed a steady flow of spirit stones, so only moderately graded herbs would suit his needs.  

But planting herbs that were too low-grade would be a waste of the garden’s high-quality soil, and their value would be negligible.  

His solution was to focus on first-grade mid-tier herbs, supplemented by a small number of upper-tier ones.  

Thanks to the high-grade spirit soil, mid-tier herbs could mature in just one year, allowing him to quickly recoup his investment and reinvest. Upper-tier herbs would take about three years, but once harvested, they would bring him massive profits.  

*"Let me see what seeds you’ve chosen."*  

Elder Liu had prepared the seeds as agreed, but Zhang Yan frowned after a quick glance. Though the seeds weren’t low-grade, their value was mediocre—far below his expectations.  

After some thought, he decided to visit Wood Spirit Peak.  

When in doubt, seek his master!  

Why wouldn’t he take advantage of such a long, pristine thigh if he had one?  

Since he attended Zhuge Wan’s lessons daily, he brought up the matter the very next day.  

*"You want to maximize the output of your high-grade spirit field?"* Zhuge Wan smiled at her youngest disciple.  

Though Zhang Yan had the lowest cultivation, the poorest spiritual roots, and no notable background, Zhuge Wan had taken a liking to him.  

If asked why, she would simply say: *This child reminds me of myself!*  

And she wasn’t joking—he truly did.  

Most importantly, Zhang Yan was sharp. He grasped her teachings after just one explanation, and his approach to solving problems in the Spirit Plant Dao aligned perfectly with hers.  

In Zhuge Wan’s eyes, Zhang Yan wasn’t just a disciple—he was a kindred spirit.  

So when he came to her with questions, she answered earnestly.  

*"Your reasoning is sound. Right now, you need to quickly amass spirit stones to exchange for resources and boost your cultivation. But you’ve overlooked your greatest advantage."*  

*"Greatest advantage?"*  

Zhang Yan was puzzled.  

Sure, he was handsome and had cheats, but those weren’t applicable here.  

*"Please enlighten me, Master."*  

Since he couldn’t figure it out, he simply waited for Zhuge Wan’s answer.  

*"Your greatest advantage is being my disciple!"*  

Zhuge Wan looked at him with amusement. Though he was a genius in the Spirit Plant Dao, he still had much to learn about navigating the world.  

Or perhaps he simply didn’t realize just how much influence a Golden Core master could wield.  

*"You can negotiate contracts with the sect or external cultivation families."*  

*"Huh?"*  

Zhang Yan’s eyes widened.  

How had he forgotten this?  

As Zhuge Wan’s disciple, he had her backing. Whether dealing with the sect or aristocratic families, his credibility would be sky-high.  

This meant he could secure specialized contracts—for example, if the sect needed Spirit Rhino Flowers for the next decade, he could sign an agreement where they paid him an advance, and he’d deliver the goods later.  

If he was bold enough, he could even demand payment for the next seven or eight years upfront. With Zhuge Wan’s support, that wouldn’t be a problem at all!  

For some reason, this scheme felt eerily familiar to Zhang Yan...
