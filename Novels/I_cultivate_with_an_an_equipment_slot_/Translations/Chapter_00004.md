# Chapter 4: The Difference Between Equipment  

Although the Qingheng Sect largely ignored its outer disciples—even exploiting them periodically—there was one exception.  

When an outer disciple first reached the Qi Refining stage, the sect would grant them some rewards as an investment in their potential. These rewards might be modest, but for disciples like Zhang Yan, who had no backing or connections, they were invaluable.  

After freshening up, Zhang Yan stepped out of his room and happened to see Old Lin emerging as well.  

"Shall we go?" Old Lin greeted him casually, preparing to lead Zhang Yan to work.  

But then he froze, his eyes locking onto Zhang Yan in shock.  

"You… you’ve reached Qi Refining!" Old Lin’s voice trembled slightly.  

"Just luck," Zhang Yan replied with a bow, neither confirming nor denying it outright.  

His cultivation level wasn’t something he could—or intended to—hide.  

"Luck?!" Old Lin scoffed. "Damn it all, why have I never had such luck?"  

As someone who had spent decades in the world of cultivation, Old Lin knew better than to believe in mere luck when it came to breakthroughs.  

"In that case, Junior Brother Zhang, you should hurry to the sect headquarters," Old Lin said, quickly adjusting his demeanor. "Once you receive your jade token and talisman, you’ll truly be recognized as a member of the sect." His attitude had shifted entirely, now addressing Zhang Yan as "junior brother."  

"Please, Elder Lin, there’s no need for such formality. You can still call me Zhang Yan," Zhang Yan protested.  

"That won’t do. Before, you were a mortal. Now, you’re a cultivator—we must address each other as fellow disciples."  

Old Lin was adamant. "Since you’ve already broken through, you’ll need to visit the sect. I won’t keep you any longer—go ahead."  

Seeing that Old Lin wouldn’t budge, Zhang Yan stopped resisting but still maintained a respectful demeanor.  

Leaving the estate, Zhang Yan oriented himself and headed straight for the outer sect.  

Perhaps it was the exhilaration of reaching Qi Refining, but even the surroundings seemed more vibrant, the air fresher. The overgrown weeds and the sounds of insects and frogs did nothing to dampen his spirits.  

"Finally here."  

Glancing at the sign reading "Administration Hall," Zhang Yan straightened his robes and strode inside.  

The hall was small, with only a middle-aged Daoist leaning on the counter. He looked up as Zhang Yan entered.  

"Junior Brother, what brings you here today?" the Daoist asked with a smile.  

"Greetings, Senior Brother. I’ve just reached Qi Refining and came to collect the sect’s rewards," Zhang Yan replied with a bow.  

"Ah, a newly advanced disciple! It’s only been two months since the new disciples joined, and you’ve already broken through—congratulations!" The Daoist beamed. "May I ask who your master is?"  

"I have no master. I’m just an outer disciple working as a spirit farmer in the herb garden," Zhang Yan answered honestly.  

"No master, yet you reached Qi Refining in just two months? Junior Brother, you’re a prodigy!" The Daoist quickly verified Zhang Yan’s identity before handing him a jade token and a storage pouch.  

"These are the standard rewards for outer disciples who reach Qi Refining: one storage pouch, two sets of robes, one jade token, and 100 contribution points. You may also visit the Enlightenment Peak to learn two spells free of charge."  

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"  

Zhang Yan gratefully accepted the items. The robes were already inside the storage pouch, while the jade token served as his sect identification. It was also a magical artifact capable of storing contribution points and, in emergencies, activating a protective barrier that could withstand a single strike from a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator while marking the attacker.  

If sold, this token alone could fetch dozens of spirit stones.  

Of course, no one would dare sell their sect identification. The Qingheng Sect strictly forbade it, punishing offenders with expulsion and crippled cultivation—or worse, for severe cases.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"  

After expressing his gratitude, Zhang Yan turned to leave.  

As he walked away, the middle-aged Daoist watched his retreating figure thoughtfully before shaking his head.  

"Ah well… just an outer disciple, after all."  

---  

Exiting the Administration Hall, Zhang Yan couldn’t help but feel a surge of excitement as he touched the storage pouch at his waist.  

Just as he had expected, both the pouch and the jade token were recognized as equipment by his system.  

**[Name]:** Low-Grade Storage Pouch  
**[Quality]:** Gray  
**[Effect]:** Any part of the body can serve as an access point for storage.  

**[Name]:** Identification Jade Token  
**[Quality]:** Green  
**[Effect]:** +10% defense, protective barrier, marking ability.  

"Something’s off."  

Frowning, Zhang Yan studied the descriptions.  

The jade token was a green-grade item, yet its effects were merely the standard functions of the artifact itself—unlike the secondhand items he had encountered before.  

The legacy jade slip had granted him minor mastery of the Evergreen Art, while the spirit hoe had provided skills like plant identification and cultivation.  

But these new items only displayed their inherent traits.  

"Are these artifacts different somehow?"  

After some thought, it struck him.  

The previous items had been used before, while these were brand-new, mass-produced sect artifacts.  

"So the Evergreen Art mastery and plant-related skills came from the previous owners’ experiences!"  

The realization hit him like lightning.  

"If that’s the case, I need to collect more secondhand equipment!"  

"The more used artifacts I gather, the more useful skills I can extract!"  

With this in mind, Zhang Yan changed course.  

Instead of returning to the herb garden, he headed straight for the sect’s marketplace.  

The Qingheng Sect was a major power, boasting tens of thousands of disciples, a Golden Core elder, and control over two nations with intercontinental trade.  

Naturally, it had its own marketplace where disciples could trade goods.  

Though smaller than dedicated trading hubs, the sect market had fewer counterfeits and guaranteed quality. Some items were even cheaper than those sold outside, prompting many outer disciples to buy secondhand artifacts here and resell them elsewhere for profit.  

Zhang Yan had never been interested before, but now that he knew the value of used equipment, it was time to explore.
