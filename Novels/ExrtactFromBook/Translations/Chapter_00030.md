# Chapter 30: Making a Big Profit  

For core disciples like Luo Erjia, who hail from top-tier factions, money is both important and unimportant.  

When wealth can be transformed into an aid for cultivation, it naturally becomes valuable and worth striving for. But when one merely hoards money without converting it into resources, it loses all significance.  

Ambitious cultivators with vision would never allow themselves to be trapped by the illusion of wealth.  

Thus, even if Han Yue had demanded five, three, or even just one mid-grade spirit stone per demon beast, Luo Erjia—affectionately called "Little Luo"—would have accepted without hesitation.  

However, in such a scenario, Han Yue would have lost her goodwill and recognition as a Beast Taming Sect disciple. The trade-off was for Han Yue to weigh.  

But Han Yue had no intention of haggling. Little Luo's offer already satisfied him greatly, and he saw no need to push for more.  

Moreover, the two storage artifacts and two demon beast corpses Little Luo had advanced him represented a substantial investment. Han Yue had no intention of betraying that trust.  

The two quickly reached an agreement.  

This mutually beneficial transaction left both parties extremely satisfied.  

Initially, Han Yue had considered extracting some information from Little Luo. But now that their relationship had shifted to a business partnership, he decided to hold off.  

Once the deal was sealed and their rapport deepened, there would be time for questions later.  

Without wasting another moment, Han Yue stood and took his leave, setting off under Little Luo's eager expectations.  

He retraced his path at breakneck speed, his escape light cutting through the sky.  

After pausing briefly in an area roughly 10,000 kilometers from Flesh-Splitting Market—just long enough to effortlessly dispatch a few first-rank demon beasts—he returned to the market.  

He didn’t even stop by his home, heading straight for the trading house. There, he sought out Xiao Qing, handing her the Corpse-Storing Pouch, the Treasure Pouch, and the materials list, entrusting her to handle the transaction.  

He then retired to a teahouse on the seventh floor to rest.  

After their long collaboration, Han Yue had come to trust Xiao Qing implicitly. Her professionalism and impartiality had earned his respect, and he now relied on her expertise for most of his dealings with the trading house.  

True to its mercantile foundations, the trading house had its own unique methods when it came to business.  

Before long, Xiao Qing returned with the results of the transaction, meticulously detailing each item.  

Four first-rank demon beasts fetched 1,200 trade coins.  
Two second-rank demon beasts sold for 9,600 trade coins.  
Total income: 10,800 trade coins.  

The materials list consisted of spirit herbs commonly used by bloodline cultivators and refined demon beast components, all of which the trading house had in stock.  

After applying Han Yue’s discount, the entire purchase came to just 1,500 trade coins.  

Following his agreement with Little Luo, as long as Han Yue delivered the requested materials, the remaining profit was entirely his.  

Buy low, sell high—Han Yue walked away with a net profit of 9,300 trade coins, having expended only a fraction of his time and energy.  

It was practically like earning two second-rank demon beasts for free.  

His wealth accumulation had skyrocketed once again.  

Han Yue never imagined that his diligent hunting efforts would be outmatched by simply acting as a middleman.  

Now, all he hoped was that Little Luo would keep this arrangement going for as long as possible.  

After collecting the prepared materials from Xiao Qing, Han Yue returned home.  

Three days later, with his mana fully replenished, he took to the skies once more.  

His golden escape light streaked across the heavens, occasionally spiraling in exuberant loops—a clear sign of his excellent mood.  

With a clear destination in mind, Han Yue flew even faster than before.  

Before long, he arrived at the pond where the Crimson-Horned Python dwelled.  

After several days, the water level had stabilized, and the once-murky pond had regained its clarity.  

Little Luo was nowhere to be seen.  

Glancing up at the nearby mountaintop, Han Yue spotted Milk Green—the black panther—peering warily at him from behind a boulder, only its feline eyes visible.  

The beast was nothing if not dutiful.  

Han Yue settled onto a rock, meditating to recover his mana while he waited for Little Luo’s return.  

Less than two hours later, a thunderous rumbling echoed in the distance.  

Han Yue rose into the air, scanning the horizon.  

In the distance, towering shrubs collapsed one after another, their falls accompanied by deafening crashes.  

It was as though an enormous bulldozer was plowing through the forest, carving a path straight to the pond.  

Han Yue knew at once that Little Luo had returned.  

Sure enough, as the last of the trees toppled, Little Luo burst into view, dragging the corpse of a black hound behind her.  

"Eh? Runner, you're back already? Did something go wrong?"  

Little Luo was stunned to see Han Yue, assuming he must have encountered trouble and been forced to turn back.  

Han Yue chuckled. "Not at all. I’ve completed the transaction—I’m here to deliver your materials."  

"What? Already? You made it to Flesh-Splitting Market and back in under four days?"  

Little Luo’s astonishment only grew.  

Han Yue’s travel speed far exceeded her expectations.  

"Big Bro Runner! Your movement technique’s grade must be insanely high! That speed is terrifying!"  

She hadn’t expected Han Yue to be even faster than she’d imagined.  

The nickname truly fit.  

Han Yue retrieved the Corpse-Storing Pouch and Treasure Pouch Little Luo had given him earlier and handed them over.  

After carefully inspecting the contents, Little Luo broke into a delighted grin, her dimples making her look utterly charming.  

"Perfect! Exactly what I needed—and the quality is excellent!"  

"Big Bro Runner, you’re amazing!"  

"Can you make a few more trips for me? I’ve got plenty more demon beast materials stockpiled!"  

"If you can help me move them all, I’ll go all out on hunting!"  

"With all these demon beast resources in the outer regions just sitting there, we could team up and make a killing!"  

Little Luo’s excitement was palpable. Given her strength, hunting second-rank demon beasts was child’s play.  

The only reason she hadn’t gone all-out before was the logistical nightmare of transporting her spoils back.  

This was why many cultivators, even those strong enough to hunt freely in the outer regions, rarely did so.  

The vast distances and transport limitations made demon beast hunting an inefficient way to gather resources.  

But with Han Yue’s unparalleled speed bridging those gaps, those constraints vanished.  

Little Luo could hunt to her heart’s content, unleashing her full potential without worrying about wasted effort.  

Her thoughts aligned perfectly with Han Yue’s.  

In fact, Han Yue had come to her with the exact same idea:  

"Opportunities like this don’t come often. Let’s make a big profit!"
