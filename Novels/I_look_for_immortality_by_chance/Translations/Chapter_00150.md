# Chapter 150: The Eight-Legged Insect Demon!

A demon core!

A demon core is a rare treasure that can only be formed by naturally gifted demonic beasts. It allows them to absorb the essence of the sun and moon, granting them unfathomable and mystical abilities. In a sense, demons possessing such cores possess immense potential and are highly likely to break through their limitations to reach higher realms.

Gu Yuan had slain numerous demons in the Scarlet Moon Great River, yet he had never encountered a single demon core—such was their rarity.

At this moment, the owner of the demon core revealed himself from the side of the floating clouds. He appeared as a young man dressed in white robes, adorned with a jade pendant at his waist and a jade hairpin in his hair, exuding the refined air of a noble scion. Yet, a faint demonic aura lingered around him, unmistakably marking him as non-human.

Above his head, the demon core shimmered with spiritual light, intermittently releasing streaks of lightning that disrupted the spiritual artifacts wielded by the women. Their coordination faltered, and they were forced into retreat during the battle.

"Hahaha! First Mistress, with Brother Bai's help, your spiritual artifacts are useless! How can you possibly stand against us? Surrender now, hand over the spirit pearls, and perhaps I'll spare your life—after some… pleasurable company!" The golden toad on the floating clouds burst into laughter, taunting the voluptuous woman before him.

The woman had peach-blossom-like features and a curvaceous figure, even more alluring than the one who had captured Gu Yuan. Strangely, her aura was solid and ethereal, without a trace of instability—as if honed through rigorous cultivation, unshakable as a boulder. Yet, her combat skills seemed mediocre, with only illusion techniques as her forte.

But the golden toad merely unfastened his robe, revealing his upper body—his chest suddenly sprouted dozens of densely packed eyes that emitted golden light, instantly dispelling all illusions and shattering the woman's most potent seals.

"Whoosh—!"

The woman's expression darkened as she channeled streams of profound yin energy, weaving defensive seals around herself. Though struggling, she managed to hold her ground against the golden toad's assault.

The other women, however, fared far worse. Their auras were already unstable, and their combat prowess relied heavily on spiritual artifacts. With their artifacts intermittently malfunctioning and one of their companions missing, they were outnumbered two against three, putting them at a severe disadvantage.

"Esteemed Daoist, you are a rare and gifted being—why aid this toad demon? Why not join us on the island as my honored guest? We could enjoy each other's company and rule the island together?" The leading woman, growing desperate, called out to the white-robed youth controlling the demon core.

The youth merely cast her a cold glance, his eyes filled with disdain. Without a word, he continued manipulating the demon core to disrupt their spiritual artifacts.

Seeing this, the woman paled, but a ruthless resolve flared within her. She prepared to unleash her final trump card, determined to drag her enemies down with her.

Just then, a vast spiritual force surged forth, taking the form of a roaring dragon entwined with invisible lightning, striking toward the white-robed youth. The sheer intensity of this spiritual assault was so overwhelming that even the golden toad—a mid-stage Earth Demon—and the mid-stage Foundation Establishment woman were visibly shaken.

Such terrifying spiritual power!

The white-robed youth's heart clenched. Without hesitation, he summoned a small jade bell and placed it before him.

"Dang—!"

The bell chimed softly, emitting a deep, resonant tone that rippled outward in invisible waves, clashing against the oncoming dragon.

The dragon roared furiously, unleashing bolts of lightning, but the jade bell was no ordinary artifact. With gentle oscillations, it withstood the formidable spiritual assault.

Yet, in the next instant, the youth's expression twisted in alarm. He transformed into his true form—a bizarre insect demon, ten feet in length, with a spiked back, eight legs, and a body as lustrous as white jade.

The moment he revealed his true form, a blinding sword light flashed toward his back.

"Clang—!"

Sparks erupted as the sword struck the demon's carapace. Astonishingly, the insect demon's natural armor withstood the slash of a mid-grade spiritual sword.

"Swish—!"

But the sword light suddenly split—one into two, two into four, then sixteen—all converging on a single crystalline segment of the demon's shell.

Simultaneously, a handsome figure had silently appeared beneath the floating clouds. In his hand, a strange seal resembling a coiled dragon pulsed with radiant light, suddenly shooting toward the demon core above the insect demon's head.

**Dragon-Binding Seal of Truth!**

Ethereal green vines, capable of restraining even a dragon, unleashed a tremendous force of suppression upon the space surrounding the demon core.

"No!"

"Don't even think about it!" The white insect demon shrieked. Two of its eight legs abruptly snapped off, transforming into razor-sharp projectiles that shot toward the Dragon-Binding Seal with speed rivaling Gu Yuan's sword light.

"Boom—!"

At the same time, the demon core blazed with thunderous light. Combined with the two severed legs, it shattered the forming seal just before it could fully manifest, allowing the demon core to narrowly escape back into the insect demon's body.

But the cost was two legs, now reduced to ashes.

"Clang—!"

With the demon core safely returned, the insect demon's aura surged. The luminous glow on its carapace intensified, allowing it to withstand the assault of sixteen sword lights.

Yet, its fighting spirit had completely evaporated. Without hesitation, it plunged into the sea, vanishing without a trace.

"Brother Bai!" The golden toad cried out in dismay, his beady eyes darting about as he contemplated fleeing.

But the voluptuous woman would not let him escape so easily. With a flick of her jade ruler engraved with mountain patterns, she launched another assault, forcing the golden toad back into battle.

Both combatants, however, spared a sliver of their attention for the young man by the floating clouds. Though only at the early Foundation Establishment stage, his decisive and thunderous tactics had clearly tipped the scales of this battle.

"Whoosh—!"

Yet, in the next moment, the young man's entire form dissolved into flowing water, vanishing without a trace—leaving not even a wisp of his aura behind.

"My lord!" The voluptuous woman, still locked in combat with the Earth Demon, called out in desperation. But the vast expanse of the sea stretched endlessly, and the young man was nowhere to be seen.

---

Far across the boundless ocean, a large, six-legged insect with a spiked back and jade-like sheen swam frantically. Only after confirming that no pursuers followed did it finally relax, its eyes burning with fury and resentment.

"Damn it all! That stupid toad didn't even scout the island properly before dragging me into this mess! If I hadn't sacrificed two legs, I would've lost my demon core—or worse, my life! Once I recover, I'll make them pay!"

Cursing and fleeing, it traveled for an unknown length of time before a verdant island—shaped like a giant turtle—came into view, its bamboo forests swaying in the wind.

At the sight of the island, the insect demon finally relaxed. Transforming back into its human form—a graceful, white-robed scholar—it stepped onto the shore.

"Your master has returned! Why is no one here to greet me?" it shouted.

But unlike usual, the cave was eerily silent.

Squinting, the insect demon saw a young man in a cyan Daoist robe sitting cross-legged, watching it with a composed expression.
