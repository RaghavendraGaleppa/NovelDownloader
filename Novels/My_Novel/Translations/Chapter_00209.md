# Chapter 209: Peering into the Great Primordium, the Four Great Characteristics

A young man walked down the stairs. He wore a colorful robe that was dazzling to the eye, a jade belt at his waist adorned with sachets and jade pendants.

"Madam Broken Sword is renowned throughout the land. It is only right that she enjoys the finest room with a private box. Surely no one has any objections?"

"Since Master Cai is the owner of the True View Tower, we naturally have no意见 regarding your arrangements," replied an old woman holding a sword, her eyes closed until this moment. She opened them slightly, casting a glance at Wen Caishang and Li Xian.

The young man's name was Cai Qiuzhou. He came from a wealthy family with properties everywhere. He was neither a cultivator from Yunan Dao nor from Longxiong Dao; he simply loved doing business.

Cai Qiuzhou cupped his fists. "The True View Tower belongs to the heroes of the world. I, Cai Qiuzhou, merely provided the funds and effort, acting as a humble assistant for a meager salary. There are few guest rooms; how could I dare make a decision on my own? I must ask for your opinions. Does anyone object?"

Tongmu Laoren Hong Muya, the Gluttonous Toad Hand Di Bin, and the Sword-Hugging Old Woman Su Yu... the heroes on the third floor had no objections.

Cai Qiuzhou smiled. "In that case, please settle in. Congratulations, Madam Broken Sword. You are the second to occupy a guest room."

Wen Caishang smiled. "You heroes, showing pity for a woman's不便, have not competed with me for the room. I, Caishang, am deeply grateful."

There was no hint of gratitude in her words. In the Jianghu, there is no such thing as "giving way." It was simply that they did not dare to compete, or could not win if they did.

The fourth floor was quiet, the top of the tower. More than seventy feet high, it offered a commanding view of the small town.

Entering the residence, she fastened the door bolt.

It was serene and tranquil, the room exceptionally spacious.

It contained a courtyard, rockeries and flowing water, screens, and a bathing pool... it was like a separate world. Pushing open the window, the streets below were crowded with heroes, sitting on hard benches, enduring the scorching sun... the difference in treatment was as vast as heaven and earth.

Li Xian thought to himself, "Martial artists train in martial arts to improve their strength. What they seek is nothing more than this. Since the Madam possesses formidable strength, she can naturally handle any situation with ease."

He unpacked his belongings, organizing the money, clothes, and poisons... confirming nothing was amiss. Wen Caishang nodded slightly. Li Xian had handled all the miscellaneous matters along the way with great care, which satisfied her greatly.

She took off her boots and sat cross-legged. She restrained her breath and practiced internally, slowing the decline of her extraordinary techniques. Li Xian moved lightly, not daring to disturb her. He looked around at the room's decorations.

"Senior Li Bohou has extensive knowledge. After interacting with him for two days, I have even learned to appreciate calligraphy, paintings, flowers, and porcelain."

Li Xian stopped in front of a gallery. In the painting, a cold plum blossom stood proudly in the snow, its charm unique. The plum blossom bloomed, a snowflake adorning its petals. At first glance, it seemed incredibly beautiful, lifelike, as if it were the real thing.

Unconsciously, he had been gazing at it for a long time.

"Plum blossoms flourish in the snow. Such a flower is said to be rare. But it is also not rare. Do you know why this painting is hung here?" Wen Caishang walked over slowly.

Li Xian said, "Please enlighten me, Madam."

"I haven't taught you how to appreciate paintings," Wen Caishang said with a light laugh. "Tell me your feelings first. Let me see how much talent you have."

Li Xian pondered for a moment and said, "According to my understanding, appreciating a painting is like appreciating a person. Because no matter how lifelike a painting is, it ultimately cannot compare to the real thing. Just as you said, plum blossoms are said to be rare, but also not rare. If you look for flowers in winter, you can usually find them."

"In that case, if one wishes to see plum blossoms, they only need to wait for winter. Isn't this painting of plum blossoms redundant? Hmm... it cannot be said to be entirely redundant, after all, not everyone has the leisure to search for flowers in the cold wind of the twelfth lunar month."

"But it is redundant to hang it here. Although the True View Tower is not tall, its standards are not low. This painting must be precious; perhaps it is a collection of Master Cai's. Such value, if it were only for its lifelike quality, would naturally be unreasonable."

"I observed it carefully just now. I discovered that the plum blossom in the painting is lifelike, but that is only one aspect. The ingenious part is that every branch and trunk is painted with a different technique. This single plum blossom contains the essence of the painter's entire school."

"Therefore, those who appreciate this painting are not appreciating the painting itself, but the painter's world-shocking skill. They unconsciously linger within it, unable to return. Madam... I do not know if what I said is correct?"

There was an ancient gallery in the One Harmony Manor. It contained many famous paintings. Li Bohou had taught him the way of appreciation, explaining the schools of painters. The so-called outsider looks at the painting, the insider looks at the brushwork.

Li Xian had only dabbled superficially, but now, based on his understanding, he spoke at length. Wen Caishang frowned slightly. "That is indeed a school of appreciation. Who taught you this?"

"Senior Li Bohou," Li Xian replied honestly as he appreciated the painting.

Wen Caishang let out a cold snort. "Lift your hand."

"Madam..." Li Xian was confused but raised his hand anyway. Wen Caishang said coldly, "I told you before that you must not hide anything from me. How dare you still hide things from me? How should I punish you?"

Li Xian was stunned. "Madam, I truly did not hide anything from you." Wen Caishang said, "But you did not主动 tell me either."

Wen Caishang said, "That Li Bohou is himself a heartless and unrighteous man. What is the use of learning his way of appreciating paintings?" With a gentle sweep of her sleeve, a bloody wound appeared on Li Xian's palm.

The injury was severe, tinged with a trace of internal energy. Wen Caishang said, "You must quickly forget that third-rate skill of his."

Her voice softened. "The true way of appreciating paintings is the exact opposite of what you just said. If it were as you said, wouldn't all the paintings in the world be works of炫耀 skill?"

"Everyone would compare whose brushwork is more exquisite, whose techniques are more complex. Would it be very interesting to see many such paintings?"

Li Xian suddenly understood. "What you say is reasonable, Madam."

Wen Caishang glanced at the sword wound, and a trace of regret arose in her heart. She did not know why she had been so angry just now. The sword contained internal energy, making the injury very painful, and it might not heal for several months. Seeing his broken skin and flesh, she no longer felt the cold indifference of reward and punishment as before. She couldn't help but think:

"Why was I so angry just now? Ah... everything Li Xian has learned so far was taught by me. I was afraid he would make bad friends and be led astray. This punishment was indeed too heavy, but he needs to learn a lesson from it."

Wen Caishang said, "Therefore, appreciating the brushwork is the first aspect. Appreciating the charm is the second. This painting of a cold plum blossom in the snow was painted by the artist Gong Lao. After his wife died, in the winter two years later, he painted this while looking at the plum blossoms and thinking of his wife."

"What you said about each branch being painted with a different technique is indeed true. However, Gong Lao's painting skills were profound, and he had mastered all the various schools of painting. He painted it naturally; this is the most superficial layer of the painting."

"There are some self-righteous, vulgar types who only know the first aspect but not the second. It is truly laughable."

Li Xian smiled awkwardly.

Wen Caishang said, "Though it is a painting of a plum blossom, it is actually a painting of his wife. Look at the painting: a single cold plum blossom stands proudly. But savor the charm within..."

Li Xian freed himself from the constraints of painting techniques and felt it carefully. He immediately felt the howling wind and snow, the plum blossom swaying gracefully... as if he were there. In the howling wind and snow, it seemed as if she was there. In the swaying plum blossoms, it seemed as if she was there...

When love is deep, naturally, she is everywhere. But just looking at the painting, it was impossible to see any clues. Li Xian thought to himself, "This artist Gong Lao is truly a man of deep passion. His love is so profound, it is admirable."

He couldn't help but ask, "Madam, what became of Artist Gong Lao?"

"I do not know," Wen Caishang said.

"Thank you for your guidance, Madam. Otherwise, I would have missed this painting and regretted it for life," Li Xian said.

"Naturally," Wen Caishang returned to her seat. "If you wish to learn how to appreciate objects and paintings, I can certainly teach you. Li Bohou's superficial knowledge is not worthy to be compared with mine."

Li Xian thought to himself, "I remember that before, Madam had quite a few words of praise for Senior Li Bohou. The speed at which women change their faces is truly fast."

The tower was lively.

Heroes came to ask for seats and ascend the tower one after another, competing with each other. It was very lively. The heroes of Yunnan Dao and Longxiong Dao were as numerous as the sea, as dense as a forest. How could the small True View Tower accommodate them all?

Although the Dragon Claw Banquet was of great importance, the news had not been widely spread. Therefore, it was an exaggeration to say that all the heroes of the two daos had entered the banquet.

The seasons in Long Claw Town were like spring.

It was still late winter, in the middle of the first lunar month. The green fields of Long Claw Town were full of vitality, with babbling brooks and shimmering light. The scenery was beautiful.

Master Cai knocked on the door. "Have I disturbed you, Madam?"

Li Xian glanced at Wen Caishang. Seeing her sitting cross-legged on the bed, practicing internally with a calm mind, he said, "Not at all. Is there something you need, Master Cai?"

Cai Qiuzhou said, "Long Claw Town is remote and mountainous. It lacks seafood and mountain delicacies, but it has its own local specialties. As the owner of the tower, I wish to invite you heroes to taste them. The dishes are being served one after another, and I would like to invite you, Madam, to grace the private box to taste them."

Li Xian smiled. "Thank you for your trouble. I will go and inform the Madam and ask her to make the decision."

"Good," said Cai Qiuzhou.

Wen Caishang also had a desire for good food. So she went to the private box to enjoy the guest banquet in the tower. Long Claw Town is rich in mountain mushrooms, which are delicious. Among them is a type of mountain mushroom called "Dragon Claw Mushroom," which looks like a dragon's claw and contains a potent toxin.

However, with a special cooking method, the toxin is removed. The taste is indescribably delicious, not inferior to mountain delicacies and seafood. Interestingly, wild boars run rampant in the mountains.

The meat of these wild boars is tough and smelly. Unless one is extremely hungry, it is hard to eat. Yet, when "Dragon Claw Mushroom" is stir-fried with "Wild Boar Whip," one is fresh and sweet, the other is foul and smelly. Combined, they become a delicacy of the world.

Wen Caishang saw Li Xian holding chopsticks with his left hand, knowing his right hand was injured. She said, "The diet of martial artists is also based on this principle. Among humans, there are one hundred and eighty Xuanhuang foods. The higher the ranking, the rarer and more potent they are."

"But consuming the top three to drink their essence would result in extremely useless martial arts techniques. Therefore, for martial artists' diets, one cannot blindly pursue high-ranking foods. How to combine them is the most important thing. However, this matter depends greatly on fate."

In this way.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang settled into their residence.

The guest room was spacious, with plenty of space. They could practice martial arts to their heart's content.

Li Xian refined his martial arts, diligently practicing "Vast Sky Legs." His proficiency accumulated bit by bit.

[Vast Sky Leg]
[Proficiency: 4895/20000 (Perfected)]

Every morning, dense fog必起 (inevitably rises) in the mountain streams. Li Xian practiced his leg techniques, causing the water vapor to pour in. The mist swirling around him was a奇特 (unique) sight.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]
[You have comprehended the essence of the Golden Scales in the Pond technique, and your proficiency in the Spirit-Refining Realm (Shi Jing) has increased by 2.]
[Your attainments in various martial arts are extremely profound. You have gathered the skills of many heroes, your heart feels something, your mind understands something, and the speed at which you digest the essence of heaven and earth has increased.]
[Spirit-Refining Realm (Shi Jing), Proficiency +3]

Li Xian's body was filled with the essence of heaven and earth, stored but not dispersed. When attending banquets, whenever he had time, he would refine his martial arts to promote digestion.

Broadening his horizons, his mind became vast.

He contained the universe within.

This secretly契合 (aligned with) the essentials of martial dao cultivation.

[Spirit-Refining (Shi Jing)]
[Proficiency: 91/100]

The Spirit-Refining Realm has nine transformations, and strange phenomena will naturally appear. Li Xian's body emitted a faint fragrance, his face as flawless as jade. He was a little over seventeen, not yet eighteen.

Elegant and graceful, with a wondrous, immortal appearance.

A handsome young master, hard to find in this mundane world.

Wen Caishang was very satisfied, nodding secretly.

Li Xian's eyes were tightly closed, his Embryonic Phase even stronger. The double pupils in his eyes almost appeared, but he forcefully suppressed them. The red mole on his forehead glowed brightly.

Red light illuminated his face, his hair fluttering.

The Perfect Physique and the Double Pupil Physique were both extremely powerful. Li Xian felt his power surging. His whole body trembled, his spine like a divine mountain, making strange "cracking" sounds.

Behind him, it was as if a towering mountain stood, with five-colored light flowing within. Within it were cranes, colorful deer, true dragons... all splendors gathered, ineffably wonderful.

The strange phenomenon Li Xian displayed was far superior to others!

Although he came from a humble background, through a twist of fate, he was favored and nurtured by the Madam. The foundation of his bones and the grounding of his realm were not inferior to anyone!

Wen Caishang raised her eyes to look at him, gazing for a moment. "I didn't expect Little Xian to have laid such a foundation. This is naturally very good; it is because of this that I appreciate him. But this child's temperament still needs tempering. Before that, I must suppress him a bit. Such a fine, exquisite胚体 (胚体 - embryo/base material), I must slowly carve and polish it."

Li Xian's strength had advanced again. The path of Spirit-Refining and Shedding the Mortal had reached its end. If he encounters a fortuitous opportunity, he can touch the Second Realm of the martial dao with ease. If not, it will be no more than a year or so.

"Right now... I can already peer into the scenery of the Second Realm of the martial dao."

"The Second Realm of the martial dao is Bone-Refining and胚胚 (胚胚 - embryo formation)."

"Martial artists have long consumed the essence of heaven and earth, and their physique gradually transforms."

"Above the Spirit-Refining Realm, characteristics appear one after another. The ethereal immortal sound, I have already experienced it."

"But besides that, there are three other characteristics!"
