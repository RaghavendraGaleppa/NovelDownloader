# Chapter 2: Soul Departure  

When Examiner Lu Ya saw Zhou Qing swiftly dissecting the examination question, he initially thought the response would be shallow. To his surprise, the very first sentence directly addressed the core theme of "conduct and retreat" while subtly alluding to the concluding phrase "only you." In Lu Ya's eyes, though the analysis wasn't groundbreaking, it was flawlessly executed.  

Given the generally low standard of imperial examinations in Jiangzhou, encountering such a well-structured eight-legged essay from a mere child scholar was exceptionally rare.  

Lu Ya held the exam paper, scrutinizing it repeatedly, and couldn't help but feel a growing admiration for the young talent. He proceeded to quiz Zhou Qing on classical texts, discovering that while Zhou Qing wasn't thoroughly versed in them, his interpretations were insightful—albeit occasionally naive, as was typical of a youth. Yet, for a child scholar, such naivety wasn't a flaw.  

Even the most pedantic scholars would, at worst, dismiss such a young man as "youthfully arrogant."  

Moreover, it was evident that Zhou Qing lacked formal mentorship, which explained his sporadic unconventional views on classical texts. This only reinforced Lu Ya's belief that Zhou Qing was a promising talent.  

After all, teenagers often misinterpret classical texts—some elders do too.  

The correctness of such interpretations often hinges on one's status, position, and reputation.  

However, this brief interaction wasn't enough for Lu Ya to immediately take Zhou Qing as a disciple. Even if he did, he couldn’t do so openly.  

After dismissing Zhou Qing, Lu Ya interviewed several other candidates. Though impressed by Zhou Qing earlier, he hadn't felt an overwhelming urge to mentor him. Yet, after comparing Zhou Qing’s performance with the others, Zhou Qing stood out even more prominently in his mind.  

"Exceptional!" Lu Ya internally praised Zhou Qing once more.  

When Wang Hai submitted his paper, the examiner was appalled by the atrocious handwriting.  

Frustrated, Lu Ya couldn't help but contrast Wang Hai with Zhou Qing, feeling that the latter would have been a far more fitting protégé.  

Recognizing that even the useless have their uses, Lu Ya decided to leverage Wang Hai’s social connections. He instructed a clerk to fetch Zhou Qing’s address and told Wang Hai, "Go and befriend Zhou Qing. Assess his character and intellect in private."  

Wang Hai dared not disobey his uncle’s request, though it meant postponing his plans for a brothel visit.  

If he could persuade Zhou Qing to join him, however, that would be ideal.  

Wang Hai wasn’t foolish—he could tell Zhou Qing had impressed his uncle, likely as a potential disciple. What better place to test a man’s character than a brothel?  

---  

After returning home, Zhou Qing was about to cook when an uninvited guest arrived.  

Recognizing the visitor as Wang Hai, the nephew of Examiner Lu Ya, Zhou Qing deduced his purpose.  

But...  

"Brother Wang, you’re inviting me to a brothel for drinks and music?" Even with two lifetimes of experience, Zhou Qing found this method of "testing" someone absurd.  

What kind of test was this? What young man could resist such temptation?  

Still, Zhou Qing firmly declined.  

"Brother Wang, I must refuse."  

"Why not? It’s a refined pastime! We’ve just finished the exams—time to celebrate!"  

"Friend" was a term used between scholars, while "young friend" was for scholars addressing child scholars. Wang Hai, however, was confident that both he and Zhou Qing would soon be scholars, so the title was appropriate.  

Zhou Qing gestured toward his parents’ memorial tablets and sighed. "Brother Wang, I’m in mourning."  

Wang Hai froze. The excuse was impeccable, leaving him no room to argue.  

Not wanting to return empty-handed, Wang Hai devised another plan. Bowing, he said, "Since you’re in mourning, I won’t disturb you further. Farewell."  

---  

After leaving, Wang Hai headed straight to a brothel with a familiar courtesan. His plan was to send her to Zhou Qing’s home later to test his chastity.  

If Zhou Qing resisted, he was truly virtuous. If not, Wang Hai wouldn’t report it—instead, he’d use it to strengthen their bond. If Zhou Qing ever became a high-ranking scholar, Wang Hai could benefit from the connection.  

Plus, this brothel visit was justified—his uncle had sanctioned it.  

---  

That evening, Zhou Qing stared at his nearly empty rice jar and sighed. Studying left him mentally refreshed but physically drained, requiring large meals to recover.  

His growing body demanded even more sustenance.  

The 220 coins he’d saved for the exams had vanished within days.  

Though tempted by Wang Hai’s offer—a chance to feast—Zhou Qing couldn’t risk violating his mourning period.  

A diet of porridge and vegetables left him perpetually hungry.  

Lying in bed, Zhou Qing tossed and turned, unable to sleep. The thin walls amplified the sounds of his neighbors’ nightly activities, stirring his youthful blood.  

To calm himself, he sat cross-legged and silently recited *The Great Learning*:  

"The way of the great learning lies in manifesting virtue, in renovating the people, and in resting in the highest excellence..."  

Gradually, his mind settled.  

Then, something strange happened.  

Zhou Qing felt his body grow lighter, as if being lifted upward. He breached an invisible barrier—and suddenly, he was looking down at his own seated body from above.  

"Nightmare?"  

"Soul departure?"  

His detached soul felt no fear, only serenity.  

Then, he noticed a glow from his physical head. A book materialized before him, its title: *The Nurturing Lord of Life*.  

---  

Zhou Qing awoke drenched in sweat, trembling violently. He gulped down a bowl of cold water, barely steadying himself.  

Even after experiencing transmigration, soul departure and a mysterious book shattered his worldview further.  

His soul had been pulled back by *The Nurturing Lord of Life*, leaving his body weak, as if severely ill.  

Before he could ponder further, a knock came at the door.  

"Who is it?"  

"A maid sent by Young Master Wang, with soup to warm you."  

Zhou Qing opened the door to find a heavily made-up woman holding a food box. As he reached for it, she pushed past him into the room, then threw herself at him.  

Zhou Qing sidestepped, and she crashed onto the floor, hitting her nose on the bed frame. Tears streamed down her face.  

"Madam, restrain yourself!"  

Her wails died under Zhou Qing’s piercing gaze. He seized her arm, shoved her out, and slammed the door.  

After she left, cursing, Zhou Qing opened the food box—a hearty chicken soup.  

Ravenously, he devoured it. Warmth spread through his body, dispelling his weakness. A faint heat surged to his head before vanishing.  

He thought of the book in his mind but set the mystery aside for now.  

The "maid" was clearly Wang Hai’s test.  

Yet the soup had saved him—without it, he might have fallen gravely ill. In his current state, a serious illness could be fatal.  

Zhou Qing sighed heavily.
