# Chapter 102: So Much

Half a month passed in a flash.

During this time, apart from waiting for the Gold Essence Fruits to ripen, Chu Ning hadn't stopped crafting talismans. He had been continuously practicing to improve the success rate of his high-grade Primary Talismans.

That evening, after completing his daily talisman crafting, Chu Ning looked at the pile of talismans before him, feeling a slight headache.

"My talismans are accumulating more and more!"

For low-grade Primary Talismans, with Chu Ning's current Divine Sense, he could continuously craft 150 talismans at once, with a 100% success rate. These talismans sold without any problem. His reputation was established, and he could sell over a hundred low-grade Primary Talismans every day.

For mid-grade Primary Talismans, with his current Divine Sense, Chu Ning could continuously craft 100 talismans at once, with a success rate close to 90%. However, after the recent beast tide, for a period, the demand for mid-grade Primary Talismans wasn't very high. Of the 90 talismans Chu Ning made daily, only about ten would sell. Fortunately, after the beast tide, many demonic beasts lingered around. Recently, people probably used up most of their talismans, so the sales volume picked up again. Even so, combined with what he had accumulated earlier, he already had nearly 800 mid-grade Primary Talismans on hand.

For high-grade Primary Talismans, with Chu Ning's current Divine Sense, he could continuously craft 70 talismans at once. After half a month, the success rate had increased from the initial 40% to 50%. And these talismans were almost all still in his possession. This past month, Chu Ning had only sold fewer than 10 high-grade Primary Talismans. So now, Chu Ning had accumulated over 400 high-grade Primary Talismans.

"If I keep crafting like this, I'll have over 2,000 accumulated talismans."

Chu Ning shook his head with a chuckle. It seemed that after harvesting the Gold Essence Fruits tomorrow, he really had to make a trip to Fengxia Market. With so many talismans, it would be difficult for any place other than large stores like Cloud Sea Pavilion to take them all at once. Chu Ning had considered selling these talismans back to the sect. However, doing so would expose his Qi Condensation Level 7 cultivation, as there would be no way to explain the high-grade Primary Talismans otherwise. After some thought, he decided against it; it was better to handle them himself.

After categorizing and storing these talismans in his storage pouch, Chu Ning immediately took out his Black Night Iron Soulwood Sword and began meditating to cultivate the Spirit Refinement Art. During this period of continuous talisman crafting and cultivation, his Spirit Refinement Art had made significant progress.

[Azurewood Everspring Art (Yellow-grade Low-tier), Third Level (62/2100)]
[Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art, Volume One, Unbreaking Tendons 31/1500]
[Spirit Refinement Art, First Level 440/1000]

In half a month, after Chu Ning dedicated more time to talisman crafting and Spirit Refinement Art, he could gain nearly 3 points of proficiency daily. The proficiency of his Spirit Refinement Art had finally broken the 400 mark. In contrast, the cultivation of Azurewood Everspring Art and Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art progressed steadily.

For the Azurewood Everspring Art, Chu Ning, who had just broken through to Qi Condensation Level 7, still primarily relied on cultivating with the help of the Azurewood Spring Blossom Art. He wasn't in a hurry to use large amounts of spirit stones and pills, as he needed to stabilize his realm first. Of course, there were no higher-grade pills available anyway. In Yanji Market, pills used by late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators were practically unsought, just like high-grade Primary Talismans. Chu Ning even specifically changed his appearance with an illusionary transformation spell to ask Gu Xiaoqing, but her reply was that she didn't have any. It seemed that even if Gu Xiaoqing possessed some, it was only a small portion for her own cultivation, and she wouldn't sell them.

By cultivating with the Azurewood Spring Blossom Art, Chu Ning could still gain 2 points of proficiency daily. This was largely due to the spirit-absorbing effect of the Iron-Stem Orchid. Especially after the Iron Orchid Fruit grew, the effect of absorbing spirit qi was very noticeable. With Chu Ning's current Qi Condensation Level 7 cultivation and the amount of spirit qi absorbed, as long as he cultivated for a longer time, it was still enough to support him in gaining 2 points of proficiency. If Chu Ning had relied on Azure Spirit Fruit or Purple Crystal Bamboo before, he would probably only gain a little over 1 point a day.

The progress of the Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art, however, had completely slowed down. Although the "Unbreaking Tendons" cultivation method had better body-tempering effects than "Unwithering Bones," its proficiency gain was also more difficult. Chu Ning now cultivated for a considerable amount of time each day, yet he could barely gain 1 point of proficiency. It seemed that to increase his speed, he would need to rely on some body-tempering items.

After cultivating the Spirit Refinement Art once, Chu Ning rested. The next morning, he went to the spirit fields. The Gold Essence Fruits were ripe and ready for harvest.

Harvesting these was quite simple. Chu Ning went row by row with jade boxes, quickly filling ten large jade boxes, containing over a thousand fruits. All things considered, the yield was similar to that of the Purple Crystal Bamboo next to it. He had already asked Gu Xiaoqing, and these Gold Essence Fruits were typically worth about one spirit stone each.

After harvesting the Gold Essence Fruits, Chu Ning looked at the twenty mu of spirit fields, pondering what he should plant next. The Gold Essence Fruits were fine; after harvesting, he could use the Growth Acceleration Spell and Azurewood Spring Blossom Art, and they would re-flower and bear fruit in about a month. However, for the ten mu of land where Purple Crystal Bamboo was originally planted, Chu Ning didn't have a suitable spirit plant in mind for the moment. He already had enough talisman paper, so he naturally wouldn't plant Purple Crystal Bamboo again.

In fact, Chu Ning thought it would be best if he could plant Iron-Stem Orchids. Although Iron-Stem Orchids took longer to grow than Purple Crystal Bamboo, the Iron Orchid Fruits could temper the body, which Chu Ning himself could use. Moreover, whether Iron Orchid Fruits grown by others would bear fruit depended on luck. But he didn't have to worry about that; as long as Little White peed on each plant, combined with his Azurewood Spring Blossom Art, the Iron Orchid Fruits would definitely bear fruit. However, the seeds of the Iron Orchid Fruit were a problem, and Chu Ning didn't have any yet.

"It seems I can only go to Cloud Sea Pavilion in Fengxia Market to see if I can buy some Iron Orchid Fruit seeds. If not, I'll have to wait two months until my own Iron Orchid Fruits ripen and produce seeds." Chu Ning muttered to himself. He felt a bit regretful that the spirit fields would lie fallow for nearly two months.

Upon returning from the spirit fields to the market, Chu Ning didn't go back to his own shop but instead went directly to Gu Xiaoqing.

"Oh, Junior Brother Chu's Gold Essence Fruits have ripened?" Hearing Chu Ning's intention, Gu Xiaoqing's face immediately lit up with joy. "Recently, everyone in the sect seems to be busier, and Deacon Lin brings things for us less often. My Gold Essence Fruits here are just about to run out, so Junior Brother Chu's timing is perfect."

As Chu Ning took out the ten large jade boxes from his storage pouch, he said to Gu Xiaoqing, "Senior Sister, please take a look at the quality of these Gold Essence Fruits first."

"Alright!" Gu Xiaoqing reached out, opened a box, and took out a Gold Essence Fruit. Her beautiful eyes then turned to Chu Ning, and she nodded with great satisfaction. "It seems Junior Brother Chu not only has talent in talisman crafting but is also very proficient in spirit plant cultivation. Such high-quality Gold Essence Fruits are very rare even within the sect."

"It's just a coincidence that my wood-attribute cultivation technique and spells are quite compatible," Chu Ning offered his usual excuse. He then took out the ten large jade boxes from his storage pouch. "Senior Sister Gu, there are a thousand fruits here in total. Please count them."

Gu Xiaoqing smiled gently and said, "Since Junior Brother has already counted them, I naturally don't need to. It's truly rare to have a thousand such high-quality Gold Essence Fruits from twenty mu of spirit fields."

Chu Ning smiled and didn't respond. This wasn't the yield from twenty mu of land, but ten mu. Of course, he wouldn't tell Gu Xiaoqing that.

Gu Xiaoqing collected all ten boxes of Gold Essence Fruits into her storage pouch, then took out a pouch of spirit stones and placed it in front of Chu Ning. "Junior Brother Chu, here are a thousand spirit stones. Please keep them safe."

Chu Ning took it, then took out 50 spirit stones and placed them on the table. "Senior Sister Gu, 950 spirit stones are enough." Chu Ning didn't deliberately emphasize that Gu Xiaoqing had given him the Gold Essence Fruit seeds initially, nor did he mention her giving him pills as a gift when he bought them. However, Gu Xiaoqing was a very intelligent person and immediately understood. She didn't act coy and directly put away the 50 spirit stones, smiling, "In that case, thank you, Junior Brother Chu."

Chu Ning exchanged pleasantries and was about to leave when Gu Xiaoqing suddenly spoke, "Junior Brother Chu, I'm planning to invite everyone to Fengxia Market these next few days. I wonder if Junior Brother Chu would like to come?"

"To Fengxia Market?" Hearing Gu Xiaoqing's words, Chu Ning was quite surprised. What a coincidence! He had been talking about going to Fengxia Market for half a month, and now Gu Xiaoqing was inviting him. However, Chu Ning didn't show much emotion on his face; instead, he asked Gu Xiaoqing, "Senior Sister Gu, why suddenly think of going to Fengxia Market?"

Gu Xiaoqing smiled gently and said, "Recently, there are gradually more people in the market. I heard that a first-tier high-level demonic beast has appeared again, and the demand for pills might increase later. Plus, the various medicinal materials in the sect aren't fully stocked. I heard that Fengxia Market nearby is a large market. Tomorrow is the opening day, so I want to buy some medicinal materials for alchemy. It just so happens that Junior Brother Shen, Junior Brother Luo, and Junior Sister Lu also want to check it out, so I thought I'd invite you along."

Chu Ning had already planned to go, and since there was company now, he immediately agreed.

That night, Chu Ning worked through the night, crafting another batch of high-grade Primary Talismans.

The next morning, Chu Ning and the other four left Yanji Market.

"Can everyone use sword flight? Wind manipulation flight is too slow." Luo Yiping turned to the group and asked, his gaze falling on Chu Ning. Immediately, Luo Yiping was the first to take out a flying sword from his storage pouch. This outer sect disciple from the Spirit Beast Hall seemed to have always had a dislike for Chu Ning. Chu Ning likewise had no fondness for him, but he didn't let it show. He simply chose to remain silent.

According to sect rules, cultivators could learn sword flight upon reaching late-stage Qi Condensation. Although Chu Ning had already broken through to late-stage Qi Condensation, his displayed cultivation was only Qi Condensation Level 5. Moreover, he hadn't returned to the sect, so he naturally hadn't learned sword flight.

Then, Shen Zhengquan took out a small spirit boat from his storage pouch. Although not large, it could barely seat two people. As a disciple of the Artifact Forging Hall, it was not unusual for him to possess good magic tools. Chu Ning then saw Lu Miaoying stand beside Shen Zhengquan. Clearly, this female disciple, Qi Condensation Level 5, from the Spirit Beast Hall was planning to ride Shen Zhengquan's magic tool.

Gu Xiaoqing only reacted at this point. She hadn't taken anything from her storage pouch and looked at Chu Ning apologetically. "I forgot that Junior Brother Chu can't use sword flight. Then I'll use wind manipulation with Junior Brother Chu, and we'll arrive a bit later."

Hearing Gu Xiaoqing's words, Shen Zhengquan and Luo Yiping exchanged a glance, both a little surprised. Yesterday, when they heard Gu Xiaoqing also invited Chu Ning, they had conspired to embarrass Chu Ning today. They didn't expect it to lead to Gu Xiaoqing saying such a thing. Just as Luo Yiping was about to speak and suggest Chu Ning not go at all, Chu Ning spoke up.

"Senior Sister Gu, there's no need. I have a magic tool."

Then, everyone watched as Chu Ning took out a shuttle-shaped magic tool from his storage pouch.

"A flying magic tool?" As a disciple of the Artifact Forging Hall, Shen Zhengquan recognized it at a glance. "I didn't expect Junior Brother Chu to have such a magic tool. Its grade seems to be quite high, and the price must be considerable."

Chu Ning's expression was calm, without any hint of pride. He simply said in a normal tone, "I earned some spirit stones from selling talismans before, so I asked Deacon Lin to help me buy one."

As soon as he said this, Luo Yiping, who had just been hoping to see Chu Ning make a fool of himself, immediately looked upset. A flying magic tool could cost over a thousand spirit stones, something he, who had only recently arrived at the market from the outer sect, didn't possess.

Seeing this, Gu Xiaoqing's face showed a hint of a smile. "That's good then. Everyone can go together now." As she spoke, Gu Xiaoqing also took out a flying sword from her storage pouch.

Immediately after, the few of them each soared into the sky on their respective magic tools, heading towards Fengxia Market. Along the way, Luo Yiping, who was carefully controlling his sword, watched Chu Ning effortlessly piloting his Wind Chasing Shuttle, feeling a pang of bitterness in his heart. Flying swords could indeed allow cultivators to fly, but they were different from dedicated flying magic tools. The spiritual power required and the difficulty of control were not low. That's why the sect required disciples to be in the late-stage Qi Condensation realm before learning it. Chu Ning's Wind Chasing Shuttle, as a high-grade magic tool, required only a tiny bit of spiritual power, making it naturally much easier. He was only holding back because he was considerate of the others' speed; otherwise, he would have long since accelerated and flown to Fengxia Market.

After more than an hour, the group arrived at Fengxia Market. Although Chu Ning had been here once before with Lin Changqing, he still followed behind, acting as if he had never seen such a sight.

After entering the market, Luo Yiping turned to Gu Xiaoqing and said, "Senior Sister Gu, what do you want to buy? Shall we go with you first?"

Gu Xiaoqing shook her head slightly. "Everyone wants to see and buy different things. To save time, why don't we split up? Let's meet back at the market archway in an hour to return. What do you all think?"

"That's good too, saves us from staying too long," Shen Zhengquan agreed.

Hearing Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan say this, Luo Yiping could only feel a slight regret. And Chu Ning had absolutely no objections. Even if Gu Xiaoqing hadn't spoken, he would have found a reason to split up anyway.

After the group separated, Chu Ning went to an unpopulated area in the market. First, he cast an illusionary transformation spell, then put on a different set of clothes from his storage pouch, instantly transforming into an ordinary-looking middle-aged cultivator. At the same time, Chu Ning released the restrained aura of his Yin-Wood Spirit Physique, fully revealing his Qi Condensation Level 7 cultivation.

Only then did Chu Ning walk towards the Cloud Sea Pavilion in the center of the market. It wasn't the auction day for Cloud Sea Pavilion, so after Chu Ning entered, he felt there were significantly fewer cultivators than his previous visit.

Upon seeing Chu Ning, a Qi Condensation Level 4 attendant immediately came forward. "Senior, are you looking to buy or sell something?"

Chu Ning glanced at the attendant, who was a whole major realm lower than the one he encountered last time, but he wasn't surprised. After all, his previous visit was with Foundation Establishment cultivator Lin Changqing, so their treatment would naturally be different.

"I wish to sell some high-grade Primary Talismans and some demonic beast materials. The quantity is quite large. I also plan to buy some things." Chu Ning explained his intention, and the attendant immediately said, "Understood. Please follow me, Senior."

The attendant led Chu Ning to a room where a female cultivator, appearing to be around thirty-six or thirty-seven, was seated. This female cultivator also had a Qi Condensation Level 7 cultivation. Although her looks couldn't be called stunning, there was a charming allure in her eyes. After the attendant explained Chu Ning's purpose, the female cultivator immediately greeted him warmly.

"This humble one's surname is Zhang. May I know Fellow Daoist's esteemed surname? Would you like to sell items first, or buy first?"

"My surname is Li," Chu Ning said casually. He didn't directly answer her question but instead asked, "When I conduct transactions at Cloud Sea Pavilion, my identity and information can be kept confidential, right?"

The female cultivator surnamed Zhang smiled charmingly upon hearing this. "Fellow Daoist, please rest assured. Our Cloud Sea Pavilion's reputation is well-known throughout the markets within several thousand li. Whatever Fellow Daoist buys or sells here, once you leave Cloud Sea Pavilion, no one will know."

Chu Ning nodded slightly upon hearing this. "Let's see if you'll buy these items from me first." Chu Ning said, then began to take out items.

He first took out the things he obtained from the Blood-spotted Unichorn Ape's cave. "Five pairs of Iron Armored Ox horns, three pairs of Wild Spirit Boar tusks..." As Chu Ning took out items one by one, the female cultivator surnamed Zhang continuously tallied them. Her tone wasn't too surprised; after all, Chu Ning was at Qi Condensation Level 7. If he dedicated himself to hunting demonic beasts, he could naturally hunt many of these first-tier low-grade demonic beasts. At the same time, she felt a little strange, wondering why Chu Ning was worried about information leaks when he was only selling some low-grade demonic beast materials.

While thinking this, the female cultivator surnamed Zhang didn't say much. Instead, she watched as Chu Ning continued to take out items from his storage pouch. When Chu Ning took out two Blood-spotted Unichorn Ape hides and a horn, the female cultivator's bright, watery eyes finally glinted. "Oh, such complete Blood-spotted Unichorn Ape hides and a horn!"

Chu Ning stopped taking out items at this point and asked the beautiful female cultivator, "Fellow Daoist Zhang, how many spirit stones are all these items worth?"

The female cultivator surnamed Zhang pondered for a moment, then said, "Those items you took out earlier, the materials from first-tier low-grade demonic beasts, aren't very valuable. Together, they are worth 300 spirit stones. The Blood-spotted Unichorn Ape hides and horn are very well-preserved. The hides are worth 50 low-grade spirit stones, and for the horn, I'll give Fellow Daoist 300 spirit stones per horn, making it 700 spirit stones in total. Are you satisfied with this, Fellow Daoist?"

Chu Ning nodded and didn't speak. The price seemed fair. Then, he once again took out a pile of talismans from his storage pouch and placed them on the table. "Could you tell me the price for these mid-grade Primary Talismans and high-grade Primary Talismans?"

The female cultivator surnamed Zhang was momentarily stunned. "These are all high-grade Primary Talismans and mid-grade Primary Talismans... So many?"
