# Chapter 120: The Chip (Bonus Chapter for Reader 171021102948988)

It seemed the relic was nothing more than a sugar-coated bullet. However, the old monk Duyuan probably never expected that a rootless fourth-level Qi Refinement cultivator like Li Shiming would develop spiritual sense.

Not just Li Shiming—even among privileged "immortal second generations," few could cultivate spiritual sense during the Qi Refinement stage, even among the most talented. Spiritual root aptitude and mental aptitude were two different things; having top-tier spiritual roots didn't necessarily mean one had equally exceptional mental potential.

Rare talents like Baili Jinyan were few and far between. Otherwise, his father from the Holy Ice Sect wouldn't have prepared so many resources beyond the Qi Refinement stage for him.

Li Shiming threaded a string through the relic and hung it around his neck, allowing him to continuously absorb the high-quality Vajra Power it emitted. As for the erosion from the Buddhist imprint, he discovered it was an excellent way to temper his spiritual sense. The imprint, blocked by his spiritual sense, was gradually worn down.

His spiritual sense drew strength from his soul, ensuring a steady supply. Meanwhile, the Buddhist imprint from the relic was like water without a source—as his spiritual sense continuously eroded it, the imprint eventually transformed into pure spiritual energy, which was absorbed back into his spiritual sense, strengthening it further.

"Take the sugar coating, return the bullet!" Li Shiming muttered smugly after this discovery.

As for the other technique the old monk Duyuan had given him—"Lotus Speech"—Li Shiming had mastered it during this time and could now use it in conjunction with "Demonic Voice Infiltration."

"Lotus Speech" had significant power, primarily in its ability to bewitch minds. However, through his and IBMz15's research—especially IBMz15's analysis of the two sound-based techniques, one Buddhist and one demonic—they combined them to create a new technique.

This new technique, dubbed "Demonic Lotus Voice" by Li Shiming, incorporated the spiritual energy application of "Lotus Speech," the sound manipulation skills of both techniques, and modern acoustic research.

IBMz15's capabilities in known fields were evident through "Demonic Lotus Voice." While the new sound technique might still be immature in spiritual energy application, its sound manipulation far surpassed the original Buddhist and demonic techniques.

In terms of power, its effectiveness was currently limited by Li Shiming's low cultivation level. It worked well against peers but diminished against higher-level cultivators.

Of course, "Demonic Lotus Voice" still needed real combat testing—these were just IBMz15's theoretical projections.

During his cultivation of the "Five Elements Absorption Technique," his spiritual sense surprised him again.

As usual, he sat beside the spiritual vein, using its abundant spiritual energy to practice. When he activated the technique, his spiritual sense instinctively spread outward like a net, enveloping the entire lower-grade spiritual vein's exit.

Not a single strand of metal-attribute spiritual energy escaped his spiritual sense's grasp—all were captured and channeled into his body. This alone significantly boosted his cultivation efficiency.

From his research on Qi Refinement cultivators, he had some insights. Comparing heavenly spiritual roots, dual spiritual roots, and his own situation, he concluded:

If a heavenly spiritual root's efficiency was 100, a dual spiritual root's was 50. However, this 50 wasn't absolute—it depended on which spiritual root's technique was cultivated. If the cultivated technique matched an 80% affinity spiritual root, the actual efficiency would be 40 (50 × 80%).

For triple spiritual roots, the theoretical efficiency was 33.3%, adjusted based on the cultivated technique's affinity. Some cultivators who practiced two-attribute techniques had to average their affinities before calculating.

Li Shiming's actual efficiency was about 27, placing him among the top tier of triple spiritual root cultivators—hence his rapid progress. His choice to focus on metal-attribute spiritual energy had been correct.

Quadruple spiritual roots had a theoretical efficiency of 25%, further diminished by split affinities. Quintuple spiritual roots fared even worse.

These were just theoretical values. In reality, heavenly, dual, triple, and lower spiritual roots also differed in spiritual energy perception and absorption rates—better roots had stronger sensing and absorption.

Many quadruple and quintuple spiritual root cultivators couldn't even reach their theoretical efficiency due to poor spiritual energy perception and wasteful absorption.

Spiritual sense, to some extent, mitigated these gaps. It enhanced spiritual energy perception and extended outward, forming a more efficient collection network than the body's natural absorption.

With spiritual sense, Li Shiming's cultivation efficiency approached his theoretical maximum of 27. While it couldn't compare to a heavenly spiritual root's 100, it matched some of the weaker dual spiritual root cultivators.

He mused that setting up his own spirit-gathering array would further boost his efficiency. Even small daily improvements would accumulate significantly over time.

The next day, Li Shiming used his identity token to exchange for several inscription patterns: Spirit Storage, Acceleration, Fortification, Sharpness, Flame, and Frost. He would have exchanged for more, but his merit points were running low.

With his remaining points, he acquired a unique formation called the "Startling Cloud Thunderfall Array"—the only lightning-based formation available for exchange.

Lightning formations were highly sought after for their explosive offensive power and natural suppression of demonic techniques. However, they had a major flaw: the lightning wasn't generated out of thin air. Thunderclouds had to form in the sky first, making it easy for enemies to detect and avoid.

The "Startling Cloud Thunderfall Array" was particularly impractical due to its lengthy thundercloud formation time, making its knowledge cheap and unpopular.

Learning inscription patterns posed no trouble. Thanks to his past-life memories and IBMz15's assistance, Li Shiming grasped their essence effortlessly.

He wasn't learning them to craft magical artifacts—at least not yet. Even with IBMz15's help, his time and energy were limited.

Here, another benefit of spiritual sense emerged. After cultivating the "Jade Heart Ice Mind Technique" to nourish his spiritual sense, his mental fatigue fully recovered. Combined with the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" restoring his body, he no longer needed sleep to recuperate.

Effectively, like a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he could go without rest for at least a month. This freed up more time for his studies, though his workload increased accordingly.

Time passed. After several days of effort, his so-called "industrial mother machine"—a lathe—was completed.

---

The lathe's entire body was inscribed with Fortification Patterns, granting it stability far beyond its original design. Its cutting tool was a low-grade magical artifact, personally inscribed by Li Shiming with Spirit Storage, Fortification, and Sharpness Patterns. A small spiritual energy infusion array continuously replenished the Spirit Storage Pattern's energy.

The lathe's cutting capability was unparalleled against mundane metals.

Powering the lathe was the "Startling Cloud Thunderfall Array." The lightning energy it produced was converted into stable electricity via a newly built collector, stored in batteries, and then supplied to the lathe.

The array consumed spirit stones. With sufficient stones, it provided endless electricity, adjustable by scaling the array's size. The only drawback was the ten-minute startup time.

The first devices produced were a single-crystal furnace, epitaxial reactor, oxidation furnace, magnetron sputtering station, chemical mechanical polisher, lithography machine, ion implanter, wire bonder, wafer dicing saw, and wafer grinder.

These ten devices were for producing chip wafers. Without technical barriers and with complete designs from IBMz15 (since China could manufacture such equipment in his past life), production was straightforward.

The lithography machine he chose wasn't the most advanced nanometer-level model but an easier-to-produce micrometer-level one.

All these devices shared one flaw: they lacked control chips. Like the "industrial mother machine," they were missing their core components—a classic chicken-and-egg problem.

Li Shiming's solution was to use IBMz15 as a universal substitute, simulating the necessary control programs to operate these devices.

All this work was done alongside his cultivation. The time freed up from not sleeping was almost entirely devoted to these projects.

Three months passed. During this time, he purchased over two thousand spirit stones' worth of materials from Yun Ze, including many ordinary items.

He had to consider two critical issues: where all these mundane materials were going and the source of his spirit stones.

So far, he'd spent around four thousand spirit stones at the Yun Clan's trading house—a substantial sum. Most Qi Refinement cultivators couldn't produce such amounts at once. As a new formation master, continuing to splurge would make his wealth increasingly hard to explain.

Four thousand spirit stones were already the limit of what his identity could justify in the short term. He needed a plausible short-term income source.

The first batch of wafers was produced. Due to technical and experience limitations, Li Shiming wasn't satisfied. IBMz15's analysis identified key improvements, but he didn't want to waste these wafers.

Today was significant: the micrometer lithography machine would produce the world's first micrometer-level chip.

He didn't place it in his machine room space—it was too small. To gain experience for future advanced chips, he needed to start with micrometer-level ones.

IBMz15's data was extensive, but actual production differed from theory.

Despite the three months spent—far longer than expected given the "industrial mother machine's" precision and his spiritual sense's assistance, even using the machine room's third-grade sword base for specialized components—countless challenges arose, slowing progress.

Fortunately, he was undisturbed during this period, allowing him to focus on cultivation and his projects.

Li Shiming activated a formation in the underground space, expelling air to create a near-vacuum, temperature-controlled environment. Originally a trapping formation (ineffective against cultivators who could endure without air), it was perfect for sterile, dust-free conditions without complex filtration systems.

He didn't enter the formation. Using his spiritual sense, he fed a cut wafer into the lithography machine. A cable extended from the machine room space into the machine.

This world's first chip wasn't cutting-edge by past-life standards but a relatively outdated design.

Under IBMz15's control, the lithography machine activated, projecting light onto the wafer's surface. Like printing a photograph, it etched the intricate design onto the wafer.

The lithography machine was just a tool—IBMz15 handled the precision work.

When the chips emerged, 450 had been etched. After packaging, the final products weren't pretty—even ugly, with strange patterns to obscure their purpose.

Testing revealed only 164 met specifications; the rest were defective.
