# Chapter 73: The Headless Monk Preaches at Night

Xiao Ji walked along the road with a hammer strapped to his back.  

According to Zhao Jiuzhou's advice, even if he had a storage artifact, it was best to carry the hammer openly—it was the perfect way to deceive enemies.  

Xiao Ji found the idea amusing. He had never considered disguising his sword as a hammer before, but it would indeed catch opponents off guard.  

When invited, Zhao Jiuzhou didn't hesitate and followed Xiao Ji into the desolate mountains near Luolin Town.  

The mountains stretched endlessly, like scattered dragon scales.  

Fortunately, Xiao Ji had prepared in advance. With Song Yuanbao's help, he had combed through numerous records in the archives, narrowing down the search until he pinpointed a forbidden mountain.  

The mountain had been declared off-limits by the authorities because many had disappeared there. Since the government couldn't monitor every remote area, the usual solution was to post warnings, advising people against venturing in.  

But many knew that to obtain rare treasures, taking risks in the mountains was the best way. Countless people had stumbled upon extraordinary finds while gathering herbs or cutting timber, transforming their fortunes overnight. Such temptation was hard to resist.  

The mountain path was treacherous, but for cultivators, it posed no real obstacle.  

By the time they reached the forbidden mountain, night had fallen, and the surroundings grew even darker. The mountain wind carried eerie whispers, as if the dead were sighing.  

"Brother Xiao, are we really going to fight a Foundation Establishment expert?" Zhao Jiuzhou couldn't shake the feeling that this was a reckless idea.  

"Exactly. A headless monk. I need something from him," Xiao Ji replied. "Don't worry, I'll handle the monk. You just need to deal with any other nuisances—whatever they may be. Most importantly, be ready to ambush him."  

"Are you really at the Foundation Establishment stage?" Zhao Jiuzhou began doubting his own memory.  

When they first met at the Child-Giving Temple, Xiao Ji had clearly struggled against Duan De. If not for exposing Duan De's deceit, both of them would have died there.  

How could he have reached Foundation Establishment in just a few days?  

Was his foundation even real?  

"Brother Zhao, stop overthinking it. I know you've been skeptical about my cultivation level this whole time," Xiao Ji said. "Rest assured, I truly am at Foundation Establishment. Sometimes, those of us with talent progress quickly—a sudden epiphany can lead to a huge leap. Besides, didn’t I demonstrate my abilities at the Profound Iron Sect? Shattering a sword with a flick, freezing an iron sphere..."  

"You're a single-spiritual-root genius yourself. You haven’t been on the path of cultivation for long, yet you're already approaching the sixth level of Qi Refinement," Xiao Ji continued. "I believe you’ll reach Foundation Establishment soon too—provided you put aside your disguise techniques and focus on refining artifacts."  

Zhao Jiuzhou sighed. "Brother Xiao makes a good point, but the problem isn’t that I don’t want to refine artifacts properly. You know how expensive artifact refining is. To advance quickly, I need a lot of spirit stones."  

"Right now, I have to mine ores from the sect’s quarry alone, smelt them to extract usable spirit iron, and only then can I cultivate. I’d love to just buy spirit iron directly with spirit stones."  

The path of artifact refinement was indeed one that demanded wealth. Zhao Jiuzhou’s poverty made it clear he had chosen the wrong specialization—this was a field for those with money to spare.  

"Here’s what we’ll do," Xiao Ji decided to make an investment. "I earned some spirit stones during my last trip to Taigu City. I’ll lend you some for now."  

Investing in a single-spiritual-root genius would surely yield great returns in the future.  

Though Zhao Jiuzhou was eccentric—obsessed with disguise techniques—it didn’t change the fact that he was a prodigy.  

Without hesitation, Xiao Ji retrieved a pile of spirit stones from his pendant storage artifact, showing them to Zhao Jiuzhou. "After we finish this, take them back to your sect."  

"This… isn’t appropriate," Zhao Jiuzhou stammered, taken aback.  

"Nonsense. These are just worldly possessions," Xiao Ji said. "We help each other out."  

As they talked, they continued their journey, soon entering the forbidden mountain.  

---  

A dilapidated temple with a collapsed roof stood before them.  

Moonlight pierced through thick clouds, streaming in through the broken tiles.  

Inside the temple, a headless figure clad in tattered monk robes sat before a cobweb-covered Buddha statue, striking a wooden fish. His withered hands resembled dead branches, and the wooden fish looked like a broken stone.  

The rhythmic *dong-dong-dong* shattered the silence of the night, its cadence unnerving.  

The grotesque monk stopped striking the wooden fish and slowly turned around.  

It was then that the scene became clear—dozens of wild beasts sat cross-legged before him: foxes, wolves, tigers, leopards, snakes, boars…  

They sat like human disciples, pious and reverent, as if awaiting a sermon from an elder monk.  

Since the monk had no head, he could not speak.  

In the heavy silence, he raised his right hand and pointed at a fox.  

The fox seemed to answer a summon, crawling forward on its belly until it reached the headless monk.  

As it moved, the other beasts watched with envious eyes.  

When the fox reached the monk, he placed his right hand on its head. A grayish glow flowed from his palm into the fox’s body.  

The fox trembled, emitting low whimpers, but soon fell silent.  

Then, the monk placed both hands on the fox’s head—and lifted.  

The head came off as easily as plucking a melon.  

The headless fox collapsed, lifeless.  

The monk then placed the fox’s head onto his own empty neck.  

The flesh fused seamlessly, as if it had always belonged there.  

*Crack—*  

The monk adjusted his new head, seemingly unaccustomed to it.  

"Amitabha," he intoned in a voice neither human nor beast, the fox’s mouth moving unnaturally. "Today, the fox demon blessed by this humble monk shall ascend to the Western Paradise..."  

The other beasts bowed in reverence.  

The scene was incomprehensible—a group of savage demons, seemingly brainwashed, willingly offering their lives without resistance.  

That they would surrender their heads so willingly spoke volumes of the monk’s power.  

"Today, this monk shall speak to you of light and darkness," the eerie monk continued. "Some claim to be bearers of light, yet commit deeds of darkness. Others dwell in darkness but guide all beings toward the light of the Buddha’s realm."  

"Whether one chooses darkness or light, the Buddha says there is no wrong, for in this world, right and wrong do not exist..."  

"What say you, uninvited guests? Do you find this reasoning sound?"  

The fox’s head slowly turned toward a broken window on the left.  

Every demon in the temple followed its gaze.
