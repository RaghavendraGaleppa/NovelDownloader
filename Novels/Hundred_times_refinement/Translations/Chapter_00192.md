# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 140: The Young Master of Heavenly Fiend Sect  

Among the three newcomers, two possessed cultivation levels equal to Lin Xuan's, while the third was actually a late Foundation Establishment stage demonic cultivator. This forced Lin Xuan to adopt a more serious expression.  

His gaze fell upon the hems of their robes, where a small demonic figure was embroidered.  

"Heavenly Fiend Guard," Lin Xuan quickly identified their affiliation.  

Just as the righteous path in Youzhou was dominated by the three great sects—Biyun Mountain, One-Line Gorge, and Thundercloud Manor—the demonic path in Heavenly Fiend City was controlled by the three most powerful factions: the Extreme Demon Cave, the Ghost Wail Sect, and the Nether Fiend Cult. To maintain order, these three sects jointly formed the Heavenly Fiend Guard from their elite disciples—similar to a city garrison in the mortal world.  

The leading demonic cultivator surveyed the chaotic scene with a cold expression before fixing his hostile gaze on Lin Xuan. Though a flicker of surprise crossed his eyes upon sensing the Heavenly Fiend Demonic Qi emanating from Lin Xuan, it quickly vanished. While he couldn't fathom how this young cultivator had earned VIP treatment, daring to cause trouble in Heavenly Fiend City was another matter...  

Lin Xuan showed no trace of panic. He never acted without careful consideration. The cultivator he had obliterated was merely a rogue practitioner. Demonic cultivators were even more self-serving than righteous ones—Lin Xuan doubted the Heavenly Fiend Guard would risk offending him, the Young Master of the Spirit Medicine Mountain, over such a minor figure.  

Confident in his calculations, Lin Xuan remained unfazed.  

The leading demonic cultivator grew increasingly wary as Lin Xuan stood calmly encircled by the three of them. His expression darkened further. "Who are you?" he demanded coldly. "How dare you kill a fellow cultivator in Heavenly Fiend City—"  

Before he could finish, the sound of flute music interrupted him.  

The demonic cultivator paused, then immediately adopted an expression of utmost deference. His two companions likewise stepped aside respectfully.  

Hearing the music, Lin Xuan's expression flickered briefly before settling back into calm composure—a reaction that drew silent curses from the surrounding demonic cultivators, who thought him reckless.  

A dark cloud approached from the distance, within which loomed the fearsome silhouette of a demonic beast. The creature was several zhang long, resembling an enlarged tiger but with a single horn on its forehead and massive wings on its back.  

A Blackgold Roar!  

The onlookers gasped in awe. This was a peak second-tier demonic beast, powerful enough to rival a Foundation Establishment cultivator at the Great Perfection stage.  

But what truly astonished everyone was the luxuriously robed young man seated atop the beast. Around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, he held a jade flute in his hand.  

"Young Master!"  

The highest-ranking member of the Heavenly Fiend Guard bowed deeply toward the robed man, while the other two stood respectfully with hands clasped.  

---  

Yet the robed man ignored them. His gaze swept the crowd before he guided the Blackgold Roar to land. Clasping his fists, he greeted, "Brother Lin, it's been a while."  

He was actually acquainted with the Young Master?  

The three Heavenly Fiend Guard members paled, silently grateful they hadn't offended Lin Xuan earlier. Otherwise...  

The robed man's status was extraordinary—he was none other than the Young Master of the Nether Fiend Cult, one of the three most powerful factions in Heavenly Fiend City. Much like Xu Feng, he had befriended Lin Xuan during a visit to the Spirit Medicine Mountain for alchemical services.  

Alchemists truly commanded respect. Having received significant aid from Lin Xuan, Long Jun was exceedingly warm. "Brother Lin, why didn't you inform me of your arrival in Heavenly Fiend City? I could have welcomed you properly."  

"I only just arrived," Lin Xuan replied.  

Long Jun nodded, then abruptly turned a stern gaze toward the three guards. "What's the meaning of this? Why are you harassing my sworn brother?"  

"Young Master, it's like this—"  

The three men paled further. The leader hurried to explain, but Long Jun cut him off with a wave. "I don't care to hear it. Whatever Brother Lin did falls under my responsibility. Now scram."  

His tone brooked no argument.  

In the cultivation world, might made right—those with power dictated the rules. Far from protesting, the three guards acted as if pardoned from execution, bowing repeatedly before vanishing in flashes of light.  

The surrounding cultivators, sensing the shift in atmosphere, likewise dispersed discreetly.  

Hidden in the shadows, the two elders in green and white robes exchanged surprised glances.  

"Well, Brother Zhang? I told you this boy was untouchable," the green-robed elder said smugly.  

"To think he's on such familiar terms with the Young Master of the Nether Fiend Cult... I grow increasingly curious about his identity."  

"For now, let's merely observe. Our priority is the Demon Venerable's grand scheme."  

"Rest assured, Brother Chen. I understand."  

Their voices faded into silence.  

Watching the guards flee, Lin Xuan smiled slightly. While he hadn't feared them, avoiding trouble was always preferable. He clasped his fists. "Thank you, Brother Long."  

"Think nothing of it!" Long Jun waved magnanimously. "Since you're here, why not visit my humble abode? Allow me to host you properly."  

Lin Xuan considered briefly. Being unfamiliar with Heavenly Fiend City, he needed guidance on acquiring ghost cultivation techniques. "In that case, I'll impose on your hospitality. Please give me a moment."  

---  

Turning, Lin Xuan addressed the delicate-looking young woman behind him solemnly. "Miss Xu, Heavenly Fiend City is fraught with peril. Had you traveled with your brother, you might have been safe. But alone, you're like a lamb among wolves. You should leave."  

His words were sincere—both out of genuine concern for an old acquaintance and practical consideration. He had gone to great lengths to save her, ensuring Xu Feng owed him a favor. If Xu Yin came to harm after his departure, his efforts would be wasted.  

For both personal and altruistic reasons, Lin Xuan wished to see her safe.  

Though somewhat spoiled, Xu Yin wasn't recklessly stubborn. She had left alone after a minor quarrel with her brother. Hearing tales of Heavenly Fiend City along the way, she had ventured there out of curiosity. But after her recent ordeal, she realized this den of demonic cultivators was no place for a mere Qi Refining practitioner.
