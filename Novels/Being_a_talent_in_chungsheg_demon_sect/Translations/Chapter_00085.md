Chapter 85: Body Snatching

The towering statue in the City of the Dead was not just for show. This statue was the foundation upon which the Listening Ghost Sect was established. Built at the heart of the secret realm, it resonated with the earth veins of Skeleton Mountain, essentially serving as the bedrock of the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm itself. Construction of the statue began when Patriarch Listening Ghost was still alive, with cultivators serving as laborers and mortals as materials. It was only barely completed after Patriarch Listening Ghost's 300-year reign ended with his death. It possessed countless divine anomalies and was even tied to a trump card of the Listening Ghost Sect, not to be used unless absolutely necessary.

Yet, at this moment, everything changed.

Lu Yang sat atop the statue's head, doing nothing, yet in an instant, he twisted the feng shui, replacing the statue and becoming the nexus of heaven and earth within this secret realm! This was not his conscious effort, but a natural consequence of the disparity in their cosmic rank. Just as mortals only paid attention to the world's highest peak but largely ignored the second highest, heaven and earth often only focused on those of higher cosmic rank.

"I have arrived as invited. Senior, where are you?"

Before Lu Yang's words faded, a majestic Saint's Manifestation rose from behind him, its lips also parting to unleash a thunderous roar! In an instant, Lu Yang's voice echoed throughout the secret realm and beyond. The countless mortals within the City of the Dead were relatively fine; they merely instinctively covered their ears, feeling the sound like thunder erupting from the mountains, leaving them bewildered and at a loss. Only the eight elders of the Listening Ghost Sect felt as if Lu Yang's voice possessed 'weight', crashing down upon them with a boom, scattering their escape light and nearly sending them tumbling from the sky. They looked up at the Saint's Manifestation Lu Yang had conjured, their faces filled with terror.

"This scoundrel is arrogant... He's blaspheming the Patriarch!"

"Just a single voice made us... Could he be an existence on par with the Patriarch?"

"Impossible!"

For a moment, all eight elders' expressions changed, their faces flushed. Their previous discussions on how to subdue Lu Yang instantly became a joke! Yet, the next second, joy suddenly appeared on their faces. They saw the towering statue tremble slightly under Lu Yang's voice. A soul hidden within was awakened, letting out a long sigh:

"A disciple of the Primordial Saint Sect... has finally arrived."

As the words fell, the previously rigid statue suddenly relaxed its brow, and its eyes, originally cast from fine iron, instantly gleamed with intelligent light. The Foundation Establishment soul had awakened! A true Foundation Establishment soul, identical to Old Ancestor Yun from the previous life, and even superior, for this one's cultivation realm seemed higher than Old Ancestor Yun's!

Immediately after, Lu Yang saw a brilliant light fly out from the towering statue. Then, drawing on spiritual energy, it manifested as a handsome Taoist with a youthful face and hair like a crane's plumage, possessing a transcendental aura. He landed before Lu Yang and then chuckled, "Interesting. Where is your physical body, young friend? You're merely a soul?"

"I've made a fool of myself before Senior."

Lu Yang smiled faintly, meeting Patriarch Listening Ghost's gaze directly. "Senior doesn't seem to be in a much better state either. This must be your fifth reincarnation, wouldn't you say?"

He was certain that this person was a remnant of the Witch-Ghost Dao. However, the Witch-Ghost Dao was a thousand years old. For a Foundation Establishment True Person to live until today, they would need at least four reincarnations. Even with immense cultivation, they wouldn't be formidable.

"May I ask how Senior knew I was a disciple of the Saint Sect?"

Patriarch Listening Ghost shook his head. "Young friend, the moment you acted, you nearly wiped out my entire sect's members. Who else but a madman from the Primordial Saint Sect would act like that?"

Lu Yang frowned at the words, then righteously declared, "Senior's lineage herds people as ghosts and harms all living beings. This junior's actions are merely eliminating harm for the people!"

Patriarch Listening Ghost immediately laughed. "Indeed, a disciple of the Saint Sect!"

Lu Yang: "..."

After a moment of silence, Lu Yang proactively changed the subject. "Senior invited me here. What is your intention?"

"To escape my predicament and re-establish my Witch-Ghost Dao lineage." Patriarch Listening Ghost chuckled, "Therefore, I need to borrow something from you, young friend. Please do not refuse."

"Oh?" Lu Yang's gaze was sharp. "What does Senior wish to borrow?"

As his words fell, Patriarch Listening Ghost's expression turned sinister, his eyes containing a chilling glint as he stared straight at Lu Yang, like a hunter sizing up his prey. Lu Yang showed no fear, meeting his gaze calmly.

"Young friend, you understand, don't you? I intend to break open that Golden Core sword qi with the help of the Primordial Saint Sect, so naturally, I need a Primordial Saint Sect identity."

Patriarch Listening Ghost grinned, his teeth stark white and glinting with a chilling light. "My Witch-Ghost Dao specializes in souls, and I have some insights into reincarnation and body snatching. I have already reincarnated four times. Normally, the fifth reincarnation would mean complete oblivion, no longer transcendental. However, there are still ways to cleverly circumvent this. As long as you, young friend, are willing to lend me your body. I will replace you, and my fifth life can regain its vitality. I see that young friend has extraordinary potential; perhaps you can even help me ascend back to the Foundation Establishment realm."

His tone was calm, but the facts he spoke sent shivers down one's spine.

"Senior wishes to possess me?" Lu Yang raised an eyebrow.

"This isn't the first time. Why do you think so many Foundation Establishment cultivators died on the day the Golden Core sword qi descended, yet only I survived?"

Patriarch Listening Ghost was highly experienced; he had done something similar before. Using body snatching, he seized a mortal's physical body as a temporary dwelling, borrowing its fate to conceal himself, thereby avoiding the Golden Core sword qi's sweep. Such a method was cultivated by no one else in the Witch-Ghost Dao back then but him.

"So, Senior sought me out this time?"

"I should thank you," Patriarch Listening Ghost laughed. "I don't have much time left. If you hadn't appeared, I probably wouldn't have lived much longer."

Lu Yang sneered, "Do you think you can possess me?"

"In life, one must always take a gamble. The Witch-Ghost Dao cannot perish in my hands. For this, I am willing to pay any price; life and death mean nothing."

Though he spoke thus, Patriarch Listening Ghost's attitude was highly confident. Perhaps he was certain that Lu Yang could not be his match, or perhaps after clinging to life for a thousand years, many things had become trivial to him. Regardless, at this moment, he brought a strong sense of danger to Lu Yang.

However, Lu Yang still had one question in his heart. If it were merely for body snatching, why would the Golden Core sword qi massacre the entire secret realm? There must be a more crucial reason he didn't know about. Of course, Lu Yang didn't expect Patriarch Listening Ghost to tell him. Even what he was saying now, Lu Yang only believed a third of it, not fully trusting it. After all, Heaven knew if it was deliberately said to mislead him.

"It seems I'll have to capture Senior first, then interrogate you thoroughly!"

Lu Yang's eyes blazed, and his figure suddenly vanished. The Saint's Manifestation behind him, however, instantly became distinct, two golden hands clapping together from left and right.

*Boom!*

In an instant, dazzling golden light engulfed Patriarch Listening Ghost's vision. He was clearly caught in the Saint's Manifestation's palm, intended to be refined in a flash. Yet the next second, an even more intense brilliant light erupted from the Saint's Manifestation's hand, directly blasting open Lu Yang's palm. Then, rolling black clouds intertwined with brilliant light, finally revealing a majestic mansion towering into the clouds, with jade steps and vermillion platforms, solemn and imposing. Three large characters were inscribed on its plaque:

[Yama's Hall]!

The mansion's gates were wide open, with jade steps and vermillion platforms. Patriarch Listening Ghost stood at the head, a Dharma Body also manifest behind him, holding a skull staff in his left hand and a book in his right. This was – The Manifestation of the Dark Lord of the Underworld!

"To achieve Foundation Establishment, cosmic rank is merely an entry ticket, nothing to boast about." Before Patriarch Listening Ghost's words finished, his aura also surged in sync.

*Boom!*

The next second, his cosmic rank reached the same level as Lu Yang's. Both stood on the same starting line, yielding not an inch, and directly collided with a thunderous roar! In an instant, the remaining eight elders of the Listening Ghost Sect hadn't even had time to offer aid. The collision between the two raised visible, towering waves of energy, surging like tsunamis, shaking them back violently and causing them to vomit blood continuously. And under such a collision, the brilliant light between Patriarch Listening Ghost's eyebrows grew even brighter.

"In any case, it can no longer be concealed. Succeed, or die a martyr!" Patriarch Listening Ghost's tone was faint, yet his actions grew increasingly resolute, as if he had already made up his mind. This mysterious Foundation Establishment cultivator had used the art of body snatching to conceal heavenly secrets back then, thus escaping the Golden Core sword qi's purge. Yet at this moment, he abandoned his concealment and no longer masked heavenly secrets, causing his true identity from the past and the corresponding karma to become increasingly clear.

*Clang! Clang!*

Within the secret realm, the Golden Core sword qi suspended high in the sky also seemed to sense something, emitting a series of soft clangs, like a divine sword rumbling within its sheath.
