**Chapter 54: The Coming Storm**

For cultivators, being a divine archer was nothing. Any immortal cultivator, unless physically impaired, possessed keen senses and could hit any target infallibly. What was so special about that? But for mortals, becoming a divine archer was quite difficult.

"Immortal Zi Luo, this artifact can't be that simple, can it?" someone called out from the audience.

"Exactly, if it's just about accuracy, anyone can do that!"

Immortal Zi Luo smiled, subtly covering her face. "This fellow daoist speaks wisely. Of course, this artifact is not that simple. As you all saw earlier, the one operating the artifact was merely a mortal woman. If a cultivator were to operate it, imbuing it with spiritual energy, the enhanced range would be one thousand zhang!"

One thousand zhang, which translated to a little over six *li*.

Immortal Zi Luo continued her introduction, adding that when the artifact was forged, a golden light from beyond the heavens descended and merged into it. Besides its "eagle eye" trait, she implied there might be other undiscovered effects. Listening to Immortal Zi Luo's exaggerated claims, Tie Xiangguang, the artifact forger in the private room, chuckled.

"This seller truly dares to boast! It's nothing more than the technique of array-infused artifact forging!"

Wei Gan's mind stirred. "Array-infused artifact forging? Is this a new type of artifact forging technique? I've never heard of it before."

Finally, Tie Xiangguang had a topic where he could shine. A proud expression appeared on his face, and he said smugly, "It's just not widely known in this region. This method was conceived by array masters in Xingguo, and it's less than a hundred years old in total. It's normal for it not to be heard of here in Zhaoguo."

Gongyang Yan spoke up, "Even this old man hasn't heard of this array-infused artifact forging technique. However, Xingguo truly is a sacred land for array masters."

The speaker might have spoken carelessly, but the listener took it to heart. Tie Xiangguang swore that cultivators from Zhaoguo didn't know about array-infused artifact forging, yet how did he know? After all, he was also a native cultivator from Zhaoguo. Unable to figure it out, he simply stopped thinking about it. Wei Gan also shook his head inwardly, admonishing himself: There were far too many cultivators with secrets in this world. It would be impossible to investigate every single one.

On the auction stage, after Immortal Zi Luo finished her introduction, she announced the official start of the artifact's auction. "This artifact's starting price is twenty low-grade spirit stones. Each bid must not be less than five low-grade spirit stones."

Soon, someone bid: "Thirty spirit stones!"

"Forty spirit stones!"

"Forty-five spirit stones!"

Immortal Zi Luo, or rather, the narrative fabricated by the artifact's owner, still managed to impress many cultivators, drawing numerous bids. Even Wei Gan had considered participating in the auction but ultimately decided against it. Mainly, after listening to Tie Xiangguang's explanation, he knew that the final price for this artifact would inevitably be inflated. The spirit stones in Wei Gan's storage pouch were certainly enough to buy this artifact. But he wasn't willing to be a "sucker" at this moment. More importantly, this artifact wasn't a necessity. What Wei Gan truly intended to acquire was the Tier 1 high-grade array formation—the "Golden Light Array." This was the item Wei Gan was determined to win.

After Wei Gan withdrew, only two parties remained in the bidding for this item. One was a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator seated in the first-floor hall; the other was from the Qiao Immortal Clan, occupying a private room on the second floor of the auction house. The Qiao Immortal Clan had sent five people to participate in this auction. Their leader was the Qiao Immortal Clan's patriarch.

At this moment, he stood at the viewing platform of his private room, his gaze fixed on the bidder below. "This fellow daoist looks quite unfamiliar; may I ask where you are from? I am Qiao Gongshi, patriarch of the Qiao Immortal Clan. Fellow daoist, would you be interested in becoming friends?"

The one addressed was a tall, slender cultivator. Facing Qiao Gongshi's 'threat', the man remained fearless. "What? Does attending an auction mean disclosing all one's information? Furthermore, since it's an auction, the highest bidder wins. Why is Patriarch Qiao bringing up the name of the Qiao Immortal Clan? Are you trying to threaten me?" The tall, slender cultivator snorted coldly, turning his gaze towards the auction stage. "Aren't you going to manage this?"

On the second floor, a telepathic message instantly reached the private room where Wei Gan and the others were. Both Wei Gan and Tie Xiangguang kept their gazes fixed on their noses, remaining silent and still. Seeing this, Gongyang Yan, acting as the veteran general taking command, stepped forward. He sent a telepathic message across the entire auction venue: "Fellow Daoist Qiao! During this auction, you must not disrupt the normal order! If you offend again, we will have no choice but to ask you to leave!"

Qiao Gongshi snorted, saying nothing more.

At this point, the bidding for the longbow artifact had reached a high price of seventy-seven spirit stones. "This old man bids ninety spirit stones. This is the final offer!"

The tall, slender cultivator smiled. "In that case, I'll yield it to Patriarch Qiao."

Immortal Zi Luo's eyes brightened, and she immediately announced, "Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Qiao, on acquiring this longbow artifact!"

Watching Qiao Gongshi return to his private room with a displeased expression, Wei Gan's brows furrowed into a '川' shape, then relaxed again. He spoke, "We need to be careful; some people might become desperate and resort to extreme measures during this auction. If someone suddenly goes mad and tries to raid the auction, it would be difficult to stop them."

Tie Xiangguang shrugged it off. "If such a thing really happened, wouldn't we just leave it to the Bai family? Doesn't their Bai Clan patriarch have an eighth-level Qi Condensation cultivation?"

Gongyang Yan also began considering Wei Gan's words and echoed, "It really doesn't seem safe. This Fellow Daoist Qiao also has an eighth-level Qi Condensation cultivation." He looked down and named seven or eight cultivators, all of whom were at the late-stage Qi Condensation realm. The Bai family patriarch, a mere individual, would instantly be lost among such a crowd. Logically, an auction of this kind should have a Foundation Establishment grand cultivator presiding to ensure safety.

Tie Xiangguang, who hadn't been particularly worried initially, suddenly felt that the auction had become fraught with peril after Wei Gan and Gongyang Yan's analysis. "Gentlemen, perhaps we should speak less of such inauspicious things," Tie Xiangguang said, his already somewhat dark face turning even darker.

Wei Gan also shook his head. "I was just speaking casually, not saying it will necessarily come true. Our Zhaoguo cultivation world isn't a demonic path stronghold; with major sects presiding, the atmosphere wouldn't be so bad." The argument temporarily ceased.

However, a seed named 'vigilance' had already taken root and sprouted in the hearts of all three. The auction had commenced smoothly, but whether it could conclude peacefully and safely remained an unknown. For them, that was the most crucial thing.
