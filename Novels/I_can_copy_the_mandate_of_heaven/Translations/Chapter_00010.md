## Chapter 10: Qixuan Gate

The carriage rattled and swayed, jolting people's bones loose. Back at Daniu's side, Daniu rested his head on Li Zhiming's thigh, and Li Zhiming lay on Daniu's back. The little kids were carefree and soon fell asleep. The bumpy ride lasted about half a month, and even sitting in the carriage, people felt like their bodies were going to fall apart.

The little beast in Li Zhiming's arms seemed to sense the unease and became more docile. Li Zhiming would hold the beast and get off the carriage, taking it to the stream to drink water and picking wild fruits for it to eat. The other kids had hard biscuits from the warriors' pockets.

They didn't worry about the kids running away; the harsh terrain with steep mountains, old trees, and tangled vines made it difficult for even experienced hunters to navigate, let alone these kids. If they did escape, the warriors could catch them again and would be glad if they showed such ability.

Li Zhiming gave a biscuit to Hanli, who looked at him warily but took it and said "thank you." Daniu was dissatisfied, looking at the people staring at him and the rich kids also gazing at him. No one had anything to eat but dry biscuits, and their throats were parched.

Li Zhiming decided to share the fruits he gathered. "Come and take one each," he said, and the kids gathered around. Even the rich kids, who initially hesitated, took a fruit and thanked him.

Later, Li Zhiming went to roast a fish he caught. Without salt or seasoning, he added some wild herbs he found. When he returned with the fragrant fish, he divided it into three parts: Hanli got the head, Li Zhiming got the middle, and Daniu got the tail.

Hanli and Daniu didn't care about the division; they were just happy to have something to eat. After finishing the fish, Hanli's wariness towards Li Zhiming decreased.

As night fell, Li Zhiming slept on Daniu's back again. In the middle of the night, he heard a noise but was too tired to open his eyes. At dawn, when the caravan was about to depart, Li Zhiming saw Hanli return, covered in dust, holding a struggling fruit狸兽.

The beast had injured legs and was caught by Hanli. Li Zhiming was relieved but scolded the beast for running away. He was about to hit it but then felt sorry and spared it. Hanli teased Li Zhiming for being childish.

Li Zhiming tied the beast securely, including its mouth, and renamed it "Paopa" for its love of running. The kids gathered around Paopa, touching and playing with it. As they traveled, the scenery outside changed dramatically, and the kids marveled at the vast plains.

The rich kids, who thought themselves worldly, looked down on the others but were amazed by the mountains. Li Zhiming and the kids were approaching Qixuan Gate and leaving the mountains behind.
