# Chapter 198: Half-Disciple and the Primordial Blood Gold Essence

"Little Master?"

At the sound of the voice, Zhang Jing and Feng Wuyu, who were about to leave the secret realm, halted their steps and turned around simultaneously. The obsequious smile of the secret realm's spirit immediately came into view.

"Jiaoyun, are you calling me?"

Noticing its gaze, Zhang Jing froze momentarily, his voice tinged with surprise and confusion. 

This was the Dongzhen Huamiao Heaven! 

Rumors had it that behind the Jiaoyang Secret Realm stood a terrifying powerhouse from the Primordial Demon Sect. No matter how one looked at it, the secret realm's spirit's form of address shouldn't be directed at a disciple of the Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect like himself.

Faced with Zhang Jing's bewilderment, the secret realm's spirit didn't elaborate. Instead, it respectfully presented a crimson decree made of neither metal nor stone, saying cautiously:

"Little Master Zhang Jing, my master instructed me to give this to you."

This—

Glancing at the decree, Zhang Jing couldn't help but hesitate. 

The "master" the spirit referred to was undoubtedly the terrifying powerhouse behind the Jiaoyun Secret Realm. Coupled with the title "Little Master," the implication was clear.

As for the reason?

"It must be related to the Divine Ability inheritance of the Supreme Scarlet Karma Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade I comprehended," he thought.

But... he already had a master. 

Accepting this would feel like betraying or even disrespecting his master, Yuanming Zhenjun. Yet refusing would mean slighting the terrifying existence behind the secret realm. Who knew how they might react?

After all, in Zhang Jing's experience, beings associated with demonic paths rarely followed rules—their moods dictated their actions.

At this moment, he found himself caught between a rock and a hard place—unable to advance or retreat.

Just then:

"Junior Brother, accept it. This likely has something to do with our master. Don't overthink it. Besides, neither you nor I have the power to refuse the will of such an existence," Feng Wuyu advised with a smile, seemingly sensing Zhang Jing's dilemma.

As he spoke, his eyes briefly swept over the decree, a trace of envy flashing in his gaze.

His words were like a wake-up call.

Zhang Jing suddenly remembered that his entry into the core of the Jiaoyang Secret Realm to comprehend the Undying Blazing Sun had been granted by his master.

Coming to his senses, Zhang Jing said gratefully, "Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother."

He then turned to the secret realm's spirit and accepted the crimson decree with a composed smile. "Thank you."

"You're too kind, Little Master," the spirit replied obsequiously, not daring to show the slightest neglect—after all, Zhang Jing's status had changed.

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing's curious gaze fell upon the decree in his hand.

A flash of light erupted from it, followed by a dizzying sensation.

When his vision cleared, Zhang Jing found himself in an immense, majestic palace.

Seated on a cushion at the head of the palace was a divine figure seemingly condensed from scarlet karma flames, studying him with an amused expression. Below this divine figure sat another terrifying presence composed of countless overlapping shadows, also observing him—though with a gentler gaze.

Before Zhang Jing could react, the lower figure spoke with a laugh:

"Zhang Jing, do you know who I am?"

The voice triggered instant recognition. Though they had never met, the tone and demeanor left no doubt about the speaker's identity.

Immediately, Zhang Jing knelt and said reverently, "Disciple Zhang Jing pays respects to Master."

"Haha, no need for formalities. From now on, address me as 'Shifu'[1]," the figure replied cheerfully before continuing, "Let me introduce you—this is the Seven Desires Divine Monarch, the creator of the Supreme Scarlet Karma Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade inheritance you just learned. Without His permission, you wouldn't have been able to master this legacy."

"In gratitude, you should address the Divine Monarch as 'Shifu' as well."

"Thank you for the guidance, Shifu. This disciple understands," Zhang Jing responded respectfully, a flash of realization crossing his mind.

Without delay, he turned and bowed deeply to the divine figure above. "Disciple Zhang Jing pays respects to Shifu. This disciple will forever remember the grace of your teachings."

Observing this, Yuanming Zhenjun nodded slightly, increasingly pleased with this soon-to-be youngest disciple.

Blessed with great fortune and opportunities, yet devoid of arrogance—courteous, prudent, and gifted in both talent and temperament.

Beside him, the Seven Desires Divine Monarch also showed approval.

A majestic voice resounded:

"Zhang Jing, though you are True Yang's disciple and belong to the Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect, having inherited my Karma Flame Dao, you shall also be considered half my disciple. Should you ever need assistance, seek me at the Myriad Desires Divine Palace beyond the realms. The Scarlet Karma Decree in your hand signifies your status as my disciple and holds boundless utility."

"Additionally—" 

After a brief pause, the Divine Monarch chuckled. "Very well. This Primordial Blood Gold Essence is perfect for forging the Supreme Scarlet Karma Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade. Consider it my gift to you."

"Go now."

With a wave of his hand, Zhang Jing was returned to the secret realm before he could even express his thanks.

Now, besides the Scarlet Karma Decree, he held a blood-gold essence the size of an infant's fist, radiating crimson immortal light. A terrifying, oppressive aura instantly filled the surroundings.

"So I've... inexplicably gained half a master?" Zhang Jing murmured inwardly, glancing at Senior Brother Feng Wuyu and the secret realm's spirit, both watching him with concern.

But the next moment, his expression changed drastically.

The Primordial Blood Gold Essence, though small, was unimaginably heavy—as if he were holding up a mountain. Even channeling all his magic power proved futile.

Crack!

His bones groaned under the strain.

At the critical moment, a hand reached over and lightly supported the essence.

Zhang Jing exhaled in relief. "Thank you, Senior Brother."

"Junior Brother, did... the Divine Monarch bestow this upon you?" Feng Wuyu asked, eyeing the essence with unconcealed envy.

Zhang Jing nodded.

"Tsk—as expected of a legendary immortal existence. Had I known..." Feng Wuyu sighed regretfully.

"Senior Brother, is this Primordial Blood Gold Essence truly that valuable?" Zhang Jing ventured.

Feng Wuyu gave him an odd look before explaining wistfully:

"Valuable? This primordial essence is exceedingly rare—the ideal material for forging a life-bound treasure. Ancient Dao cultivators in our sect would go mad at the sight of it."

Pausing, he added half-jokingly, "Junior Brother, a piece like this could fetch hundreds of billions of merit points, and people would still fight over it."

Zhang Jing exhaled slowly, finally grasping the treasure's worth—priceless and irreplaceable.

As for the "hundreds of billions of merit points" mentioned by Feng Wuyu, Zhang Jing wasn't naive enough to take it literally.

"Just as Shifu said, this essence is perfect for forging the Supreme Scarlet Karma Immortal-Slaying Demon Blade. Their attributes align perfectly—it must have been chosen deliberately."

"How formidable would a blade forged from Primordial Blood Gold Essence be?" 

His mind flashed back to the heaven-rending crimson blade light he'd witnessed during the inheritance.
