# Chapter 532: The Dao Fruit of the Divine Firmament Jade Clarity Nine Palaces Profuse Vault Myriad Transformations Immortality

Lu Chuan walked with steady steps, sighing as he went, his tone filled with a hint of emotion and genuine regret.

"Junior Brother Chu Chengnan... Alas, I practiced alongside him on Qingyuan Mountain for hundreds of years. We were once as close as comrades and brothers, with a deep bond. His will was firm, his heart sincere. He schemed for five lifetimes, yet in the end, he chose to break free from this cage. Though he has failed in his attempt to attain the Golden Core and prove his Dao fruit, it does not mean he has no hope of starting over. This life of his has only just passed a hundred years. With determination, he could still live for another hundred or two hundred years."

Xu Yunfan glanced at him. The emotion in Lu Chuan's eyes did not seem feigned; it seemed to be a mix of regret that Chu Chengnan had failed to follow the True君's (Zhenjun's) scheme to ascend, and a sigh that he had broken free from the predicament and was no longer under the Zhenjun's control.

Was it real or fake?

Could there truly be a bond of brotherhood within the Primordial Origin Sect?

He didn't believe it.

However, Xu Yunfan showed nothing of the sort. It was his first meeting with Lu Chuan, and he was unaware of the man's character. Naturally, he had to be cautious with his words and actions.

"Though he did not achieve his ultimate goal, his Dao Heart is resolute, and his actions are decisive. It can still be considered a truly brave and daring act."

His words were measured and to the point. Lu Chuan did not delve deeper and naturally shifted the topic back to Xu Yunfan, his tone carrying a sense of guidance and expectation.

"Junior Brother Xu, you have now abandoned your old path and are cultivating the true method. Your Dao Foundation has just taken shape, and this is the time for fierce and vigorous progress. The True武 Subduing Demons Scripture is controlled by the Bodhisattva's Pure Land, and the World-Honored One Tathagata exerts strong control over it. Even if you cultivate it to a profound level, it will ultimately be nothing more than a bridal gown for the Bodhisattva's Pure Land. Your current switch in cultivation is indeed a break from its shackles. The atmosphere of the Divine Firmament Peak has not gone unnoticed by the Zhenjun. The most crucial matter for you now, Junior Brother, is to stabilize your foundation, gather the root Qi of heaven and earth, and condense the nascent form of the Divine Firmament Cave Heaven, in hopes of早日 entering the ranks of the late Foundation Establishment stage."

He stopped walking and looked at Xu Yunfan, his gaze intense.

"Rest assured, Junior Brother, the Zhenjun has a clear view of the entire周天 (Zhou Tian, the celestial cycle) and has his own arrangements. As long as you proceed step by step, diligently and tirelessly in your cultivation, the day you condense your Cave Heaven will be the moment a great opportunity, crucial to the foundation of your Dao path, descends upon you. At that time, as your senior brother, I will personally come to guide you into the game."

"The Zhenjun's great love and your guidance, Senior Brother, are etched in my heart, Yunfan. I will surely give it my all and live up to your expectations!"

Xu Yunfan's face showed genuine gratitude as he bowed deeply, but his heart was cold.

A great opportunity?

You must be joking.

Now, he needed to act carefully and avoid attracting attention within the Primordial Origin Sect as much as possible.

The tragic end that Chu Chengnan faced under the grand scheme of the Qingyuan Zhenjun at Cold Crow Pass flashed through his mind.

In the final moment of his attempt to attain the Golden Core, his Dao Foundation was shattered by a great Arhat from the Bodhisattva's Pure Land, who sacrificed himself and wielded a Relic Treasure, a Demon-Subduing Pestle. His withered Cave Heaven collapsed. After failing to attain the Golden Core, he was ruthlessly abandoned by the Qingyuan Zhenjun.

Such a naked display of truth made Xu Yunfan even suspect that the Qingyuan Zhenjun simply didn't know how to win people's hearts. But then he thought again, the other party was a Golden Core Zhenjun; why would he need to?

所谓的机缘,不过是真君布棋所需时抛下的诱饵和推动棋子前进的血食。

自己在下方累死累活,担着天大风险拼命争抢,最终所得与真君那庞大的收获比起来,恐怕不过是些边角碎末。

The so-called opportunity was nothing more than bait thrown out when the Zhenjun needed to set up his board, and the blood and food to push the pieces forward.

He, laboring below, taking on immense risks and fighting desperately, what he would get in the end, compared to the Zhenjun's enormous harvest, would probably be nothing more than scraps and fragments.

Even if Chu Chengnan had succeeded in attaining the Golden Core and obtained the Unmoving Mountain Dao Fruit, it would only have been to merge it into the Qingyuan Zhenjun's Cave Heaven, supporting his advancement to the mid-stage of the Golden Core.

A typical tool.

Even if he had become a Golden Core Zhenjun, to take another step forward, he would have to wait for the Qingyuan Zhenjun to advance first, for the other's Cave Heaven to be completely stable, able to hang high without needing a Dao Fruit to support it. Only then could he retrieve his own Dao Fruit and progress further.

The tearful, earnest warning Chu Chengnan gave before he left was still vivid in his mind.

"A man must rely on himself!"

Personal strength is the fundamental Dao Heart.

They chatted for a while longer. After formally bidding farewell to Lu Chuan, Xu Yunfan mounted his Divine Firmament light and flew back to the Divine Firmament Peak alone. He dismissed his attendants and settled peacefully in the depths of his own cave dwelling. Only then did he truly calm his heart and begin to plan the crucial step for his own advancement to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.

Condensing the nascent form of the Divine Firmament Cave Heaven.

To be honest, he now had the Attribute Panel.

As long as the proficiency of a technique reached a certain level, there was a high probability that he could condense a Cave Heaven naturally, without even needing to perform the root Qi gathering.

However, what was somewhat unbearable for Xu Yunfan was that his cultivation progress was always far too slow.

Basically, maintaining his daily cultivation, it would take ten to fifteen days for a single proficiency prompt to appear on his Attribute Panel.

This made him so impatient that he couldn't stand relying on his clone, Sun Wukong, to plot for the fruits on the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend仙桃树 (Xian Peach Tree).

If he followed this pace, it would likely take him thirty to fifty years to achieve anything if he wanted to condense his Dao Foundation.

The path of cultivation for the *Divine Firmament Nine Palaces Profuse Vault Immortality Scripture* had the condensing of the Dao Foundation as just the starting point, equivalent to forging the foundational vessel to contain power.

To advance from the early to the late stage of Foundation Establishment, he needed to gather the core "root Qi" that resonated with the scripture's origin within the inner landscape of this Dao Foundation. Using this as the core framework, he would then step by step construct and open up the nascent form of a Cave Heaven that belonged exclusively to his future self.

The so-called root Qi is a special form condensed from the laws and energy origins of heaven and earth, precipitated and congealed in different environments, different substances, or strange phenomena. It contains fragments of the Dao laws pointing towards a Dao Fruit, or pure and immense energy of laws.

For the *Divine Firmament Nine Palaces Profuse Vault Immortality Scripture*, which primarily cultivates the Dao of Thunder, the required core root Qi must be a heaven and earth wonder related to thunder, destruction, life, and the Profuse Vault.

The Dao Fruit that this true scripture points to is named the "Divine Firmament Jade Clarity Nine Palaces Profuse Vault Myriad Transformations Immortality Dao Fruit."

What is the Divine Firmament Jade Clarity Nine Palaces Profuse Vault Myriad Transformations Immortality Dao Fruit?

Its essence is that a cultivator uses thunder as the root and the Profuse Vault as the platform, integrating the divine order of the Nine Palaces, to temper and elevate the inner landscape Cave Heaven into a single, primordial, neither-born-nor-destroyed precious core. They then invite the manifestation of this fruit position from the Great Void Spirit Ruins Realm, hold a ritual to seek its favor,得以托举功行 (de to support their merit), hang high their Dao Foundation, possess the nature of eternity and immortality, and prove the authority of thunder's creation, destruction, and nurturing.

When this Dao Fruit is achieved, the cultivator's Cave Heaven naturally becomes a small thousand-world Cave Heaven of the Divine Firmament Profuse Vault. When thunder is born, it is the pivot of creation; when it is destroyed, it is the heavenly punishment. The Nine Palaces and the constellation stars revolve and defend within it. The myriad transformations flow without falling, ultimately transcending the Five Elements and calamities, achieving a Dao Fruit that resides in the world, immortal and indestructible.

It can be said to be one of the foremost existences among the 108 Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend fruit positions in the Great Void Spirit Ruins Realm.

This true method was once controlled by the former Divine Firmament Nine Palaces Zhenjun of the Primordial Origin Sect. However, after the Pure Yang Zhenjun shattered his Cave Heaven and slew him, the fruit position was left completely vacant.

Thinking of this.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh with emotion. He truly had a good background in this life.

Master Pure Yang had truly given him a heaven-shattering great opportunity.

Xu Yunfan silently deduced the essential formulas of the true scripture in his mind, circulated his magical power, and cultivated the Divine Firmament true scripture.

The Origin Qi of Thunder is the foundation and main artery for constructing the Divine Firmament Cave Heaven. If he wanted to accelerate his proficiency cultivation, he naturally needed to seek the fundamental source of thunder power that is supremely yang and supremely rigid, containing pure destruction and new life.

The ideal locations would be those perilous lands where thunder has been ceaseless since ancient times.
