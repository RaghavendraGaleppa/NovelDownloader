# Chapter 75: The First Forged Artifact

"This boy reminds me of myself!"

As Lei Kunhai uttered these words, Lei Wanbao's heart trembled. So, Zhang Yan should really be called Lei Yan, shouldn't he?

Zhang Yan paid no attention to Lei Kunhai's praise. At this moment, he had immersed his entire being into the art of forging. 

According to Lei Kunhai's forging notes, crafting a superior magical artifact required the smith to unite their essence, energy, and spirit, sensing the spiritual nature within the materials to create the most powerful artifact possible. Zhang Yan was now doing precisely that—attuning himself to the spiritual essence of the materials as he hammered them into shape, one strike after another.

This was no simple task. 

Lei Kunhai had instructed Zhang Yan to forge a hammer, but this request held profound implications. The shape of a hammer varied greatly depending on its purpose. A forging hammer, for instance, was larger with a flat head, while a combat hammer was smaller with a pointed tip. 

Though Lei Kunhai had asked Zhang Yan to make a forging hammer, given that this was his first attempt at artifact crafting, Lei Kunhai's expectations were modest—he only needed Zhang Yan to produce something resembling a hammer. It didn't even have to be a functional artifact. 

Of course, he didn't say this aloud. 

Meanwhile, Zhang Yan remained absorbed in his work. 

One strike, two strikes, three strikes. 

Each hammer blow deepened his understanding, allowing him to rapidly internalize the knowledge from Lei Kunhai's notes. 

After countless strikes, Zhang Yan felt something within him demanding release—an energy that found its outlet in the rhythmic pounding of the hammer. 

Finally, with one last strike, a wave of satisfaction washed over him. 

Looking down, he saw a small silver hammer, about ten centimeters long, resting on the anvil. 

This was his first forged artifact. 

"Did... I succeed?" 

Staring at the hammer, Zhang Yan was stunned. He had actually crafted an artifact on his first attempt. 

He picked it up instinctively. 

**[Equipment Name]:** Forging Hammer  
**[Equipment Grade]:** Low-grade Artifact  
**[Equipment Quality]:** Gray  
**[Equipment Effect]:** Flash of Insight (Increases the chance of success when forging artifacts.)  

It truly was an artifact. 

A smile spread across Zhang Yan's face as he turned to Lei Kunhai. 

"Senior Lei, I think I succeeded!" He handed the hammer over. 

Lei Kunhai, who had been standing nearby with an air of indifference, finally turned around. 

"Let me see." 

"Let me see!" 

Unlike his grandfather's restraint, Lei Wanbao was practically vibrating with excitement, reaching out to snatch the hammer. 

"You little brat, get lost!" Lei Kunhai yanked him aside and took the hammer from Zhang Yan. 

"This artifact..." Lei Kunhai examined it closely, turning it over in his hands. 

For some reason, it felt eerily familiar. 

Too familiar. 

The craftsmanship, the design—it was as if he had made it himself in his youth! 

How had Zhang Yan replicated his style so perfectly just from reading his notes? 

Lei Kunhai realized he needed to reassess Zhang Yan. This boy was even more of a genius than he'd thought. 

If Zhang Yan joined Qianbao Peak, the future of their lineage would be secure! 

"Senior Lei, does this pass?" Zhang Yan asked nervously. "I feel like, even though it's technically an artifact, there are still many flaws. If I had been more careful during quenching, the imperfections wouldn't be so obvious. And I rushed the forging process—I shouldn't have hurried so much. But the biggest issue is my physical strength. I'm still too weak." 

As Zhang Yan listed his shortcomings, Lei Kunhai was at a loss for words. 

Lei Wanbao, meanwhile, was utterly baffled. 

Wait, what? 

You're a complete novice who just crafted an artifact on your first try, and instead of celebrating, you're giving a self-critique? 

Have some mercy on the rest of us! 

He wanted to grab Zhang Yan by the collar and scream, "What do you gain from making the rest of us look bad? Do geniuses like you have to crush everyone else's hopes?" 

But under his grandfather's watchful gaze, he didn't dare utter a word—let alone threaten Zhang Yan. 

If he did, Lei Kunhai would make him regret it. 

The same grandfather who had defended him so fiercely would turn that fury on him without hesitation. 

The thought sent a shiver down his spine. 

No, absolutely not. That would be a nightmare. 

Clearly, he needed to cozy up to Zhang Yan instead. 

As a privileged descendant of an immortal lineage, Lei Wanbao knew his limits. After repeatedly failing to measure up to true disciples, he had accepted the truth—his achievements weren't due to talent or spiritual roots, but purely because he had powerful backing. 

Even if his grandfather was currently displeased with him, blood ties still counted for something. 

And more importantly, Zhang Yan's talent guaranteed he would become a colossal figure in the future. 

Why not latch onto him now, before others caught on? 

What? Was it embarrassing for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to cling to a Qi Condensation junior? 

Not at all! 

Lei Wanbao had been beaten black and blue by his grandfather more times than he could count, yet he still strutted around without shame. 

As long as he didn't feel awkward, there was no awkwardness! 

It was all about securing a powerful ally. 

Nothing shameful in that! 

With this in mind, he forced a smile through his bruised face and shuffled closer to Zhang Yan and Lei Kunhai. 

"What are you doing, looking like a ghost? Get lost!" 

Lei Kunhai nearly unleashed a spell when he saw the grotesque, grinning face looming toward him. 

"Disgusting. Have some dignity!" 

After berating Lei Wanbao, he turned back to Zhang Yan, his tone softening instantly. 

"Don't worry, don't be afraid. I'm actually very mild-tempered! There's absolutely no violence here." He thumped his chest emphatically. 

Zhang Yan glanced at Lei Wanbao's battered face, then nodded solemnly. 

Oh, he believed it. 

Lei Kunhai was definitely not a violent man. 

"Your artifact is decent, but yes, there are flaws. I'll point them out so you can reflect on them later. And as a smith, you can't afford to be physically weak. Here—take this." 

Lei Kunhai produced a token from nowhere and handed it to Zhang Yan. 

"With this, you can access the Scripture Pavilion to study the *Thunderflame Body Tempering Art*. If you have questions, come find me anytime. Return the token once you've mastered it." 

"Thank you, Senior Lei!" Zhang Yan accepted the token gratefully. 

As he took it, he glimpsed its properties—and was shocked by what he saw. 

The attributes on this token were unexpectedly formidable!
