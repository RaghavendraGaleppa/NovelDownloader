Chapter 11: The Guardian Ranks, Step by Step

After Li Xian finished asking the "Three Questions of Martial Dao," he already had a general idea. He thanked Pang Long, and then, unable to bear the hunger in his stomach any longer, began to eat heartily.

A few pieces of oily, fatty meat went down his stomach.

With his stomach full, his strength returned. He quickly cleaned the plate, and for the first time in a long while, his belly was filled to the brim, lifting his spirits immensely.

But he couldn't help but think again:

"I'm full now, but I wonder how my little brother is doing, all alone outside."

"Five hundred copper coins is quite a sum. It shouldn't be too difficult for him to have a meat meal occasionally. If I get the chance, I should go back and see him."

After leaving the Canteen Building, Pang Long suddenly heard a chime—Madam's summons.

He didn't dare to delay and went to see her immediately. However, leaving Li Xian alone here wasn't a good solution either.

Just then, a guardian walked by, so Pang Long called out, "Zhao Han, this kid is new. He's in your care now. Take him around and show him the ropes."

With that, he hurriedly left.

"Little brother, hello there. I saw the earlier duel. I really didn't expect you to be the winner."

The guardian named Zhao Han had a friendly smile and didn't look down on Li Xian for being a former servant.

Li Xian cupped his fists and said, "Brother Zhao, from now on, we'll be colleagues. Please look out for me."

"Hahaha, of course, of course." Zhao Han laughed heartily.

Seeing Li Xian's tattered clothes, messy hair, and dirty face, he said, "Commander Pang asked me to take care of you, so I need to do things properly. Come with me quickly."

He got Li Xian some new clothes to change into.

"I'll take you to the bathhouse to wash up and change into the new clothes."

"The guardian uniforms are made of much sturdier material; they're nothing like servant clothes. You can just throw these old ones away after you take them off."

Hearing that he could wash up, Li Xian's heart leaped with joy.

Ever since transmigrating here, he hadn't washed his body even once. He was filthy, no different from a beggar.

The guardians had a dedicated large bathhouse.

Inside, there were individual compartments. Zhao Han brought Li Xian to the bathhouse and only then remembered he didn't have a bucket. "You don't have a water bucket yet. Use mine for now."

There was a well next to the bathhouse; all the water for bathing came from there.

The well water was warm in winter and cool in summer, but the so-called "warm in winter" was only relative to the air temperature. If you poured it over your body, it was still quite cold.

Li Xian took off his clothes, hoisted the wooden bucket, and poured it over himself from top to bottom. The cold water drenched him instantly.

It was already winter. Although there was no snow, it was already quite cold.

However, the coldness soon began to fade, replaced by a wave of warmth that invigorated his spirit.

Li Xian endured the biting cold, scrubbing the dirt from his body and combing his messy long hair.

"Wow, were the servants really that miserable?"

"This kid... is actually a bit enviable."

Zhao Han, standing by, clicked his tongue repeatedly, his gaze involuntarily drifting downward as he secretly compared with his hand.

Then he looked at himself and made an unwise comparison, which gave rise to a hint of inferiority complex.

Li Xian poured a full seven buckets of water over himself. His skin turned red from the cold, but his body was finally clean.

Then he put on the guardian uniform.

"What a fine young man!"

Zhao Han's eyes lit up, and he clapped his hands in praise.

Clothes make the man, and the horse makes the rider. In just half an hour, the dirty and messy servant had transformed into a handsome young man.

"Brother Li, you're actually quite handsome," Zhao Han said.

"Really?" Li Xian touched his own face; it didn't seem bad.

"This is what a guardian should look like. Come on, I'll take you for a walk around. I'll tell you about the ways of us guardians." Zhao Han put his arm around Li Xian's shoulder and walked out.

"Our guardians... are divided into four ranks: A, B, C, and D. Since you've just been appointed, you're only at rank D."

"I'm at rank C. The higher the rank, the better the monthly salary and benefits."

"For example, as a rank D guardian, your monthly pay is one hundred and fifty copper coins. It's not a small amount, really."

Li Xian asked, "Then how do I improve my guardian rank?"

"Smart, you've hit the nail on the head." Zhao Han clapped his hands and said, "In our manor, we hold guardian competitions periodically. The ranks are reclassified based on the rankings from these competitions."

"So, the competition among us guardians is actually quite fierce. Martial arts training is hard work."

"And, the guardian rank isn't just about increasing your monthly salary; your authority within the manor also increases accordingly."

"You've been to the Canteen Hall, right? They have meals divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. The higher your guardian rank, the better the food you can enjoy."

"There are countless other privileges like that. I won't go into detail; you'll get to experience them slowly."

As they were speaking.

The two of them arrived in front of a row of houses.

"This is where we live," Zhao Han said, stopping.

Looking around, the houses here were arranged neatly in rows and columns. The walls were made of red bricks and the roofs of blue tiles; all the houses were of the same style.

Each house could accommodate four people.

"This is more like a place for people to live," Li Xian couldn't help but sigh, then thought to himself, "But it's still just a place for servants to live."

The houses were only about ten feet high, with four beds inside, making it very cramped and narrow.

Each room had a plaque with a number on it.

"Brother Li, you can live with me. Our room happens to have an empty spot," Zhao Han said with a smile.

"Great! I'd be delighted." Li Xian smiled readily.

"Haha, I'll introduce you to everyone right away."

Arriving at Room 113, Zhao Han pushed the door open.

"老大, you're back?"

"Wow, who's this? He's so handsome."

"Yeah, he looks unfamiliar. I haven't seen him before."

Immediately, two people came over, one thin and one fat, named Wang Chun and Zhuo Yilie respectively.

Zhao Han introduced them to each other, and after they got to know each other's names, he asked, "Brother Li, how old are you?"

"I just turned fifteen," Li Xian said.

"Fifteen... you're the youngest, so we'll call you the fourth," Zhao Han said. "Wang Chun is twenty-one, so he's the second. Zhuo Yilie is nineteen, so he's the third."

Zhao Han patted everyone on the shoulder and said:

"Fourth, from now on, we're all in the same boat. We have to help each other out.

If you have anything you don't understand in the future, just ask us."

Night fell.

After Zhao Han's guidance during the day, Li Xian had a general understanding of the basic rules for guardians.

He lay on the bed, no longer surrounded by the jostling and crowding of servants.

Although a faint smell of feet and sweat was still unavoidable—Second Brother Wang Chun had very smelly feet—it was much, much better.

"A complete turnaround in a single day."

"But even so, I'm still just a guardian."

Li Xian's feelings were complex; he didn't know whether to be happy or something else.

On one hand, he personally experienced that people are divided into different classes, with different levels of nobility and baseness;

On the other hand, he was relieved that his living conditions had improved.

Zhao Han turned over and saw Li Xian staring blankly at the ceiling. "Fourth, hurry up and sleep. We have morning training tomorrow."

"Okay."

Li Xian closed his eyes and fell asleep.

The next day.

The sky had just begun to brighten, and the rooster crowed.

"Get up, get up."

Zhao Han got out of bed and put on his clothes, not forgetting to slap Wang Chun on the face and kick Zhuo Yilie in the back.

The two of them slept like dead pigs, not moving an inch. Zhao Han sighed, then suddenly thought:

"That's right, Fourth Brother stayed up late last night; I need to wake him up too."

He turned his head to look, but saw that Li Xian had gotten up even earlier. He was already dressed and sitting quietly on the bed.

"Fourth, not bad. You're up early," Zhao Han said in surprise.

"When I was a servant, I had to get up even earlier. I'm used to it," Li Xian said, shrugging his shoulders and stretching his limbs.
