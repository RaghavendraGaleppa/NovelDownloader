# Chapter 254: You Call That Not Being a Demonic Sect? He's a Wife-Buffing Battle Soul (1/2)

The Peng Demon was captured in a very humiliating manner.

...

As everyone knows, humans are a race that possesses wisdom and understands the importance of division of labor and cooperation.

That is why they were able to defeat the demon race, who were born powerful and blessed with bloodline abilities.

In fact, the demon race wasn't originally called the "demon race." It was only when they united against the humans that the various clans collectively adopted the name.

The Peng Demon was a bird that valued its freedom and was unruly by nature.

It had relied on its speed to escape from the combined attacks of military formations multiple times, looking down on the so-called "coordination" of humans.

When it left its clan, its grandmother had warned it that this was only because it hadn't encountered a true genius.

Today, the Peng Demon saw one.

"Just how fast is that kid's movement technique?"

The Peng Demon fled frantically, yet it could feel that Huang Donglai, who was wearing Cloud-Walking Boots and carrying someone on his back, was even faster than it was.

He was getting closer and closer!

It was simply absurd.

Even among avian demons, its speed was outstanding!

"If this keeps up, I'll be caught sooner or later!" the Peng Demon calculated, and its heart filled with dread.

If it were caught, a fight would be unavoidable.

Once the battle started, it was at the Half-Step Sixth Grade, close to the Inner Scenery realm of humans, against two who were merely at the Observing the Deity stage...

The Peng Demon suddenly froze.

Wait a minute.

The advantage was on its side. It was practically a碾压 victory.

The Peng Demon came to a screeching halt.

Why the hell was it running?!

"If I can't outrun you, can't I just beat you?!"

...

A short while later.

In front of the nest on the cliff.

The Peng Demon, with a large lump on its bald head and tied up tightly, was thrown to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.

"Huh? Brother Mu, what's wrong with you, Brother Mu?"

Li Mo was suddenly taken aback and became vigilant.

He saw that Mu Rongxiao's eyes were rolled back, his tongue lolling out as he lay there, drooling profusely. He looked like someone who had failed to abstain from worldly pleasures for years.

"Brother Li, is there a possibility that he absorbed even more of the Soft-Tendon Powder than the Peng Demon?"

"That makes sense."

Li Mo began searching for an antidote pill.

However, he had recently purchased a lot of new pills and spiritual herbs, and there were also things Huang Donglai had picked up along the way. He couldn't find what he needed for a moment and had to identify them one by one.

Fortunately, Huang Donglai was by his side, so the identification process was much faster.

"This one is..."

"Brother Li, that's Thousand-Centipede Bone-Eroding Ash. It's specifically used to destroy evidence and bodies."

"Oh, oh, and this one?"

"This is the Five-Color Poisonous Fungus. Anyone who eats it will fall into severe hallucinations, unable to distinguish reality from dreams."

"This pill looks so beautiful, it should be..."

"Brother Li! That's Half-Step Madness Laughter Elixir! Don't let its good looks fool you, it might even taste a bit sweet. It's a must-have for home and travel, but if you eat it, you'll laugh yourself to death!"

Li Mo searched for a long time.

He even accidentally dropped the '40' with a clang on the ground.

"You... you people... are you... members of the Demonic Sect?"

The dazed Peng Demon barely managed to stay conscious, looking at the group with fear.

It had heard that among humans, there were some extremely vicious individuals, just like the disaster beasts of the demon race.

"What kind of bird language are you speaking? We are legitimate and orthodox righteous sects. How else would you have ended up in our hands?"

"This is what they call 'evil cannot overcome righteousness'!"

Li Mo picked up his hammer and frowned.

"..."

The Peng Demon looked at the tortoise-shell bind on its body, the piles of poison bottles on the ground, and that terrifying, malevolent hammer brimming with killing intent.

It then recalled their bizarre fighting style.

"I don't want to have a tongue-kiss with a human!"

The Peng Demon cried out with a grating and ugly sound. It felt it was finished; its tongue was definitely going to be cut off to be served as a side dish with wine.

*Bang—*

Little Li gave it a head-bop, adding a small lump on top of the large one on the Peng Demon's bald head.

---

"Stop your racket. I'll ask the questions, and you'll answer. If you tell the truth, I'll consider letting you live."

Li Mo said with a stern face.

The Eye of Providence showed that although this Peng Demon often harassed towns, it didn't like to eat people. Instead, it preferred to raid cattle and sheep or rush into granaries for a feast.

"Really?"

"You only have the option to believe me."

"Then ask away."

The Peng Demon swallowed its saliva and became老实.

"Have you seen this woman?"

Li Mo took out a red bean mung bean mooncake.

The Peng Demon's eyes were bigger than the mooncake. Driven by a powerful survival instinct, its eyes almost crossed as it tried to get a better look.

"Her? Of course, I've seen her!"

"She's a living Rakshasa! Look at the feathers on my head! She's the one who shaved them off!"

The Peng Demon poured out its grievances.

"Where did she go?"

Li Mo took a bite of the mooncake and asked.

"The Green Pheasant Clan's territory," the Peng Demon thought to itself, *Could this be an enemy of that woman?* Otherwise, why would he look like he wanted to swallow her whole.

"If you want to hunt her down, you can only wait for her to come out of the Green Pheasant Clan's territory."

"The Green Pheasants are few in number but very powerful. They forbid humans from getting close, and they don't even allow male demons."

"For some reason, she was allowed in as an exception and even received an audience with the clan leader..."

...

The Green Pheasant Clan's territory.

It was autumn, but this place was full of vitality.

The trees were exceptionally tall, with roots and leaves that faintly showed a magnificent blue-green hue, making this already beautiful place seem even more like a fairyland in the human world.

On the trees, paths and tree-house buildings were connected, like a fortress built in the air.

A woman in blue clothes walked slowly through the fortress. Her figure was no different from a normal person's, but in reality, her two hands were wings, and her two legs were bird claws.

She flapped her wings and flew to the treehouse at the top of the canopy.

There, she saw a young girl in a celadon dress.

The girl's expression was like the frost after dusk, her eyes as clear as the cold moon. An air of aloofness and indifference seemed to surround her, locking her in her own world.

Even a pure-blooded Green Pheasant like an elder probably wouldn't be so cold and lonely.

In fact, when she first arrived at the Green Pheasant Clan's territory, she wasn't like this. She would even raise the corner of her mouth when eating a certain kind of pastry.

Lately, she hadn't been seen eating mooncakes, and the time she spent frowning had increased.

Was it because the mooncakes had a magical power that brought happiness?

*Ding-a-ling—*

The woman in blue shook the bell on her wrist in a peculiar rhythm.

"Is the old clan leader calling for me?"

Ying Bing asked.

The woman in blue nodded.

One person and one bird moved through the vast blue-green canopies, stepping over the dappled shadows of the trees, occasionally leaving a faint dusting on the girl's clothes.

*Ding-a-ling-ling~*

The woman in blue shook the bell again, meaning:

"I'm so envious of you."

"Envious of what?"

Ying Bing withdrew her thoughts.

The woman in blue continued to shake the bell to express her meaning:

"Envious that you can speak."

Bearing the bloodline of the Green Pheasant meant one could never make a sound. Even after transforming, one would still be unable to speak.

Unless one found their fated one.

But how could that be easy?

A Green Pheasant might very well live its entire life without ever making a sound.

The woman in blue found it hard to imagine that the girl before her, with a bloodline so noble it was unimaginable, was actually...

She grew more and more curious:

"Who is the person you are thinking of?"

"Him..."

Ying Bing's cold eyes rippled slightly. Her tone, for some reason, became softer. The sunlight fell on her shimmering eyelashes, dyeing them with a faint, trembling twilight.

"He's a wife-buffing battle soul."
