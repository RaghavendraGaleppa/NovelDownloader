# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 110: Master Tongyu  

The Flaming Mountains stretched thousands of miles north of Youzhou, forming the largest mountain range in northern Zhao Kingdom. Sparsely populated and scorching hot, even wild beasts and birds were rarely seen in this harsh environment.  

Despite its inhospitable conditions, the Flaming Mountains held great renown in the cultivation world—this was where the Spirit Medicine Sect made its home. The region boasted the richest earthfire resources in Youzhou, making it ideal for alchemy.  

Three days later, Lin Xuan arrived at the Flaming Mountains.  

The moment he landed, a wave of blistering heat assaulted him. Frowning, Lin Xuan estimated the temperature exceeded fifty degrees Celsius. Were he not a cultivator with a tempered body, an ordinary person would have collapsed instantly.  

With a thought, a faint blue glow enveloped his body, bringing immediate relief. This water-attribute barrier was perfect for resisting the intense heat. After orienting himself, Lin Xuan summoned a wind-walking technique and began his ascent.  

Unlike most sects that erected multiple defensive formations around their headquarters, the Spirit Medicine Sect was different. Its unique status and frequent visits from outsiders seeking alchemical services meant the Flaming Mountains—though their core territory—were only protected by a few illusion arrays to deter mortals.  

Lin Xuan easily reached the legendary "Mountain Within a Mountain." This natural wonder derived its name from its geography: a massive volcanic crater so vast that it housed a smaller, cauldron-shaped peak within its basin.  

This extraordinary formation, seemingly crafted by divine hands, was perfect for alchemy. Legend had it that a millennium ago, various cultivation sects in Youzhou had fought fiercely over this land. Yet, they ultimately abandoned their claims after a wandering cultivator posed a simple question:  

"Even if you seize this place, do you possess the alchemical skills to utilize it?"  

To prove his point, the cultivator demonstrated his prowess by refining Foundation Establishment Pills before the assembled sect leaders. While most sects achieved only a twenty percent success rate with this crucial mid-tier elixir, he astonishingly reached fifty percent—producing one successful batch for every two attempts.  

Convinced, the sects ceded the Mountain Within a Mountain to him on one condition: he would assist them in pill refinement. This cultivator became the founding patriarch of the Spirit Medicine Sect. Over time, others who preferred alchemy over cultivation joined, gradually forming today's sect.  

Upon arrival, Lin Xuan found several cultivators already waiting outside the Mountain Within a Mountain. Judging by their attire, some belonged to nearby sects while others were wandering cultivators drawn by reputation. Today was the Spirit Medicine Sect's designated day for receiving external guests.  

The cultivators barely glanced at Lin Xuan before looking away—most visitors here shared the same purpose. Resigned, Lin Xuan took his place among them.  

Hours passed, yet none showed impatience. The reason was simple: the Spirit Medicine Sect's members were notoriously eccentric. Rumor had it that a Core Formation elder once offended an alchemist here with rude demands, prompting the latter to deliberately sabotage ten consecutive batches of precious pills.  

While failed attempts were common in alchemy, the chief alchemist's consecutive "mistakes" were clearly intentional. Furious at seeing his rare ingredients wasted, the elder nearly lashed out—only to be restrained by companions.  

In most places, a Core Formation expert commanded respect. But at the Spirit Medicine Sect, even their mere Foundation Establishment mid-stage sect leader enjoyed unparalleled status. The unspoken rule across Youzhou's cultivation world forbade harming Spirit Medicine alchemists—they were too rare and skilled to risk losing.  

Witnessing this dynamic, Lin Xuan's ambitions stirred. Joining the sect would secure his future pill supply while granting him the protective status of an official alchemist. Despite the sect's modest strength, membership offered immense benefits.  

At noon, a beam of white light flashed as a young man in his twenties emerged. "Esteemed cultivators, please follow me," he said respectfully.  

Lin Xuan blinked in surprise—the guide was merely a mortal, likely an outer sect disciple. The waiting cultivators eagerly followed him inside.  

The volcanic interior had been meticulously transformed by generations of Spirit Medicine patriarchs. Chambers carved into the mountain housed natural alchemy workshops fueled by earthfire veins. The most prized location remained the cauldron-shaped peak at the crater's heart—said to be a natural alchemical vessel surpassing all man-made cauldrons. Yet none since the founder had mastered its use.  

The mortal guide efficiently inquired about each visitor's pill requests, directing them to appropriate workshops for negotiations with alchemists. When he turned to Lin Xuan, his eyes held reverence—he'd been informed this was a Foundation Establishment expert.  

"How may I assist you, immortal?"  

Lin Xuan smiled mildly. "My thanks, but I'm not here for alchemy."  

The youth blinked. "Then why—?"  

"I wish to join your sect."  

The boy's reaction mirrored Wu Tian's, but he wisely refrained from comment. "In that case, please accompany me."  

---  

"Another failure!"  

In a spacious alchemy chamber, a white-bearded Taoist sighed mournfully. Before him floated a violet-red fireball fed by earthfire spewing from an iron beast's maw. The opened cauldron in his arms emitted the acrid stench of charred ingredients rather than medicinal fragrance.  

"Even the simplest high-grade pill—Marrow Cleansing Elixir—has foiled me twenty times now," grumbled the disheveled elder. Despite his appearance, this was none other than Master Tongyu, Spirit Medicine Sect's leader and Youzhou's premier alchemist—a Foundation Establishment mid-stage expert.  

Higher-grade versions of the same pill offered vastly superior effects. While Master Tongyu could reliably produce mid-grade pills, high-grade refinement remained elusive. Was it true, as legends said, that such achievements relied solely on fortune rather than skill?  

As he pondered, a message talisman arrived. A respectful voice reported: "Sect Leader, a Foundation Establishment cultivator seeks to join our sect."  

Master Tongyu stood abruptly. Cultivators devoted to alchemy were rare, especially among higher realms. For decades, the sect had struggled with succession—most alchemists were short-lived Qi Condensation adepts. Recent deaths had left worrying vacancies.  

If this decline continued, the sect's legacy might perish. The news of a Foundation Establishment applicant brought hope. Determined to assess this potential recruit personally, Master Tongyu resolved to uphold the sect's ironclad rule: only those with genuine alchemical talent could become formal disciples.
