# Chapter 254: Spirit Serpent  

Standing above the vast ocean, one truly comprehends the immensity of the world.  

Li Shiming hovered over the sea's surface, surrounded by nothing but endless water. Without the IBMz15 guiding his position, he would never have been able to locate the spot marked on the ancient map with just his eyes.  

Excitement surged within him. In the world of cultivation, many cultivators ventured into unexplored territories in search of relics. The cultivation realm was filled with countless unknown ruins—abandoned caves left behind by cultivators who had perished from injuries or old age often became targets for exploration.  

Li Shiming and his doppelganger, Li Yuanba, had only explored one such ruin before. That expedition had yielded substantial rewards—though it had also been fraught with danger. This time, his exploration of the Five Qi Sect's ruins marked his second true venture into the unknown.  

He halted his sword light. According to the IBMz15's calculations, this was the location marked on the ancient map as the site of the Five Qi Sect.  

Gazing at the endless expanse of water around him, he couldn't help but sigh at the vicissitudes of time.  

After casting a protective spiritual barrier around himself, he descended into the sea.  

The spot was roughly three hundred miles from the shore. The water was clear, allowing visibility for dozens of meters, and his spiritual sense extended even further.  

Soon, he reached the seabed.  

To his disappointment, there was nothing remarkable in sight. His spiritual sense probed downward, but the thick layer of silt drastically reduced its range. At most, he could penetrate fifty meters beneath the seabed—beyond that, it was futile.  

Unfazed, he began moving slowly across the seabed while scanning with his spiritual sense.  

Suddenly, a sense of foreboding gripped him. Instinctively, he activated *Step-by-Step Lotus Blooms*. A white lotus appeared beneath his feet, while another bloomed a hundred meters away.  

A slender, venomous serpent emerged from the silt, baring its four fangs as it lunged at him. Its strike seemed to land on his body—but in reality, it only bit into an afterimage.  

Li Shiming's hair stood on end. Had he not been vigilant, he would never have escaped the serpent's ambush.  

The serpent was a spirit beast nearing the level of a Great Demon. What was even more terrifying was that he hadn't detected its presence until it attacked.  

Despite maintaining an active spiritual sense, the serpent had managed to approach him undetected—an inconceivable feat.  

He had long heard that the ocean was the most dangerous place. The only reason he dared to venture here was because this area was relatively close to the shore—still within the safety of coastal waters.  

---  

The serpent, having missed its strike, didn't relent. Its body cut through the water like a streak, pursuing Li Shiming relentlessly.  

Underwater combat was not his forte. Unless a cultivator specialized in aquatic battles, most would find themselves at a disadvantage beneath the waves.  

Both spells and magical artifacts were hindered by the water's resistance. Fire-based spiritual energy, in particular, was severely suppressed.  

The drag of the water also slowed down artifacts, requiring time to adapt before fighting effectively. Even movement in the sea was affected, reducing speed to less than a third of what one could achieve in the air.  

Li Shiming, however, didn't have to worry about this. *Step-by-Step Lotus Blooms* allowed him to teleport instantaneously between two lotus flowers, bypassing the water's resistance entirely.  

As the serpent closed in, he channeled water-attributed lightning energy and unleashed a *Lightning Strike*.  

The spell erupted into countless electric currents in the water around him. He swiftly retreated to avoid being caught in his own attack.  

But when he reappeared a hundred meters away, he was stunned to find the serpent had vanished.  

He was certain the *Lightning Strike* hadn't killed it. Even if the full force of the spell had struck the serpent—which it hadn't, due to the water dispersing its power—it wouldn't have been enough to kill a spirit beast nearing Great Demon status.  

"Cunning creature!" Li Shiming's expression darkened as he activated the *Earthen Shield Pearl*, enveloping himself in a powerful defensive barrier.  

The *Earthen Shield Pearl* was a spoil of war obtained by his doppelganger, Li Yuanba, after slaying a sect's true disciple. Its defensive capabilities were formidable, though it required earth-attributed spiritual energy to charge beforehand.  

With the shield in place, he felt slightly more at ease.  

The brief skirmish had stirred up the seabed, reducing visibility as silt swirled in the water. Combined with the serpent's ability to evade spiritual detection, he had to be even more cautious.  

He didn't summon his flying sword—its speed underwater was inferior to the serpent's.  

The moment he sensed a ripple in the water beside him, he teleported away. A white lotus bloomed in the distance as he reappeared, just as the serpent's fangs snapped shut on empty water.  

"It's a *Phantom Veil Serpent*!" Li Shiming realized after evading the attack.  

He had read extensively in the Shu Mountain Sect's archives—or rather, scanned them into the IBMz15's database. The system had quickly matched the serpent's appearance and combat style to records from an ancient jade slip found in a ruin.  

The *Phantom Veil Serpent* was an ancient venomous spirit beast. Its skin could block spiritual detection—whether through spiritual sense or other means—rendering it invisible to cultivators.  

Additionally, it possessed an illusionary ability, allowing it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings, akin to invisibility.  

The combination of these traits made it one of the most lethal ambush predators.  

Though the jade slip didn't specify the potency of its venom, the serpent's threat level was ranked above many infamous poisons—a testament to its lethality.  

Fortunately, this *Phantom Veil Serpent* was only near-Great Demon level. Had it truly reached Great Demon status, Li Shiming would have been in grave danger.  

Now that he understood its nature, his eyes gleamed with interest. While the serpent posed limited danger to him, its presence here suggested that something from ancient times still existed in these waters—something that sustained the serpent's survival.  

But before he could explore further, he needed to deal with the *Phantom Veil Serpent*. Its stealthy attacks were still a threat.  

Electricity crackled around him as he unleashed multiple *Water Thunder Orbs*—a water-attributed lightning technique from the *Nine Heavens Lightning Strike Art*.  

These orbs functioned as proximity mines, detonating upon contact or when triggered by Li Shiming, releasing a burst of water-attributed lightning in a wide area.  

At his current late Foundation Establishment stage, enhanced by the *Five Elements Qi Absorption Array* in his spiritual lake, his spells reached the peak of Foundation Establishment power.  

Unable to locate the serpent, he didn't linger in one spot. Instead, he continuously teleported across the seabed, scattering *Water Thunder Orbs* in his wake.  

Though seemingly random, their placement followed a formation pattern. Each orb acted as a formation flag, though their single-attribute energy limited the formation's overall power.  

Li Shiming reappeared at the formation's center, standing atop a white lotus while twelve others bloomed around him in a defensive array.  

He waited.  

The *Phantom Veil Serpent* didn't keep him waiting long.  

Confident in its ambush prowess, the serpent ignored the numerous orbs and struck again—materializing beside Li Shiming without warning.  

This time, he didn't evade. The *Earthen Shield Pearl* took the brunt of the attack.  

He finally witnessed the serpent's venom in action. The pearl's earth-attributed barrier corroded rapidly where the fangs struck, the damage spreading swiftly.  

The serpent's bite packed the force of a half-step Golden Core cultivator's full strike. Without the *Earthen Shield Pearl*, his own trap might have backfired.  

Acting swiftly, he triggered all the *Water Thunder Orbs*.  

Within a two-hundred-meter radius, water-attributed lightning erupted, saturating the area. The formation amplified the effect, though it would only last for two breaths.  

The *Phantom Veil Serpent*, having failed its attack, attempted to vanish again. But the lightning forced it out of stealth, revealing its position sixty meters away.  

A white lotus bloomed beside the serpent as Li Shiming teleported in. His third-grade sword foundation, infused with immense physical strength and sword intent, slashed down with full force.  

This was the culmination of his preparations—a single decisive strike.  

The blade struck the serpent's vital point—seven inches below its head.  

Li Shiming's close-combat prowess was extraordinary. With his flawless physique, dual body-refining techniques, third-grade sword foundation, and sword intent, this strike rivaled a half-step Golden Core cultivator's full power.  

The *Phantom Veil Serpent*, though formidable, was still not a true Great Demon.  

The sword cleaved halfway through its body, lodging firmly in the wound.  

The serpent thrashed wildly, trying to dislodge the blade.  

"Die!" Li Shiming roared, his left hand seizing the serpent's head, preventing it from using its fangs.  

His right arm strained as he forced the sword deeper, severing the serpent's spine.  

The serpent's body lashed against him with desperate strength, each strike equivalent to a late Foundation Establishment cultivator's full-force blow. But to Li Shiming, it was negligible—his defenses were unbreakable.  

At this moment, he was akin to a humanoid beast—a spirit beast nearing Great Demon-level physicality.  

Had the *Phantom Veil Serpent* been capable of speech, it might have wondered who the real monster was.  

Even Li Shiming was astonished by the serpent's resilience. His third-grade sword foundation was his strongest weapon, yet it had struggled to deliver the killing blow.  

After ten breaths of struggle, the blade finally severed the serpent's spine.  

The bisected serpent twitched violently, its jaws gaping in his grip. Its vitality was astounding.  

But now, it was truly defeated.  

After a moment, the *Phantom Veil Serpent* died. He stored its corpse—its skin alone could be crafted into a rare spiritual artifact.  

The *Earthen Shield Pearl* was nearly drained of earth-attributed spiritual energy, corroded by the venom. He set it aside for later.  

Now, his attention returned to the seabed.  

This time, he didn't rely solely on his spiritual sense. Instead, he began excavating the silt with his spiritual power, storing large amounts in his storage bag before discarding it elsewhere.  

The laborious task lasted an entire day, digging over thirty meters deep.  

Gradually, the seabed's secrets were unveiled. His spiritual sense detected man-made stone blocks—remnants of ancient construction.
