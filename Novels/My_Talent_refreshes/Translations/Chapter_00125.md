# Chapter 125: Only One Leaves Alive

Despite having just descended from the large mountain cave, Chu Ning was still cautious, sending his puppet bird to scout the cave first.

After confirming that the cave was the same as when he had left, without any significant abnormalities, Chu Ning slowly stepped out into the large cave.

Then, Chu Ning released Little Spirit White from his spirit beast pouch. He was counting on it to lead the way once they were outside.

As soon as Little Spirit White was released, its small head tilted. It made no sound but immediately transmitted a message to Chu Ning:

"Woof, other cultivators have been here."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning's expression froze, then his face became serious. He undoubtedly trusted Little Spirit White's keen sense of smell. Back then, Little Spirit White had been able to track down the Earth Spirit Spring water by relying on a faint trace of Old Man Sun's scent. And when Chu Ning had used an illusionary transformation spell to change his appearance, Little Spirit White had recognized him instantly. Chu Ning suspected it relied on its acute sense of smell to perceive auras.

Since Little Spirit White now claimed someone had been there, it certainly couldn't be wrong.

His spiritual sense instantly spread out, Chu Ning vigilantly defending himself while cautiously probing. However, under Chu Ning's scrutiny, there was no one in the cave.

Chu Ning carefully walked towards the cave entrance, then extended his spiritual sense outwards, probing beyond the opening.

"Hmm?"

Just as Chu Ning's spiritual sense reached its fifty-zhang limit outside the cave, a figure appeared within its range.

"Perfected Qi Condensation?"

Sensing the aura emanating from the other party, Chu Ning's expression subtly changed. This was the first time he had encountered a Perfected Qi Condensation cultivator since entering the Spirit Realm. This undoubtedly made him feel a little strange. He had seen three or four Perfected Qi Condensation individuals in the sect's training grounds before. Those few all seemed to have just entered the Perfected Qi Condensation realm. But this face was not theirs. Moreover, this person's aura clearly indicated they weren't newly in the Perfected Qi Condensation realm.

Chu Ning then felt slightly relieved. If his guess wasn't wrong, this person should have been in the Spirit Realm all along. That would at least generally confirm that they were not from the Yin Demon Sect. As long as they were a fellow disciple from Qingxi Sect, things would be easier to handle.

After some thought, Chu Ning directly maneuvered his puppet bird to fly outside, pretending to fly aimlessly around. It then stopped not far above the handsome young man's head.

Chu Ning didn't want to just walk out and cause some misunderstanding, so he decided to make the other party reveal themselves.

The handsome young man immediately noticed the puppet bird's presence, his expression shifting slightly before returning to normal as he stepped out from behind a large rock.

"Are you a junior brother from the sect?" the handsome young man asked loudly, a gentle smile on his face, towards the cave entrance.

Chu Ning's figure slowly emerged. Upon seeing the handsome young man, he slightly cupped his hands in a salute.

"Greetings, Senior Brother."

The handsome young man's eyes flickered with surprise upon seeing Chu Ning's Qi Condensation seventh-layer cultivation.

"Are you a newly arrived junior brother? What's your name?"

Hearing the handsome young man's words, Chu Ning confirmed his previous judgment and nodded, "Li Qun from the Outer Affairs Hall. Greetings, Senior Brother."

"Li Qun from the Outer Affairs Hall," the handsome young man murmured, his gaze fixed on Chu Ning. "Did you pick the Blazing Wood Twin-Life Fruit in this cave?"

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning understood the other party's intention. He pondered for a moment, not answering immediately. He certainly wanted to deny it, but he couldn't find a good excuse. If the other party wanted it, Chu Ning would have to consider how much was appropriate to give. As for the Fire Spirit Crystal, that was naturally out of the question.

"Qi Condensation seventh layer, capable of killing a Scarlet Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion. Not bad."

The handsome young man's smile remained on his face. The next moment, however, he suddenly raised a hand, and a pillar of fire shot towards Chu Ning. His voice then resounded, "However, you can die now!"

Chu Ning, who had long been on guard, immediately activated several defensive talismans.

"Sizzle! Sizzle!"

With several sounds, the defensive shields in front of Chu Ning shattered one after another. Although Chu Ning had only activated initial-grade superior defensive talismans, his expression still turned serious. This person's attack power was formidable. Chu Ning knew very well that this person had only launched a casual probing attack, but even so, it felt to Chu Ning to be far beyond that of an ordinary Qi Condensation ninth-layer cultivator. This was already beyond what a normal Perfected Qi Condensation realm cultivator could achieve.

"Could this person be on the verge of Foundation Establishment?"

These thoughts flashed through his mind. Seeing that the handsome young man didn't immediately attack again, but instead watched him with a mocking sneer, Chu Ning asked in a deep voice, "Senior Brother, what is the meaning of this? Why attack without rhyme or reason?"

The handsome young man chuckled at Chu Ning's words. "It doesn't matter if I tell a dying man. Let you be a clear-headed ghost."

"You've just entered the Spirit Realm, so you probably haven't reached the formation arranging grounds yet, naturally, you wouldn't know that if you obtain the spiritual rhyme of the Spirit Seed while activating the formation, you can cleanse your marrow and change your bones, improving your talent, would you?"

"Of course, only a very few people are lucky enough to have such fortune. Most disciples will only suffer from spiritual energy backlash and explode when the Spirit Seed's spiritual rhyme erupts. And I, Shang Rui, am one of those extremely lucky people."

The handsome young man, who introduced himself as Shang Rui, wore a proud smile on his face. "With Wood-Fire Dual Spirit Roots, I entered the inner sect. When I was about to break through to Perfected Qi Condensation, I was arranged to enter the Spirit Realm. When activating the formation, I was so fortunate as to obtain a wisp of the Spirit Seed's spiritual rhyme. After refining this wisp of spiritual rhyme, in less than a month, I am only one step away from Foundation Establishment."

"According to sect rules, once one obtains the spiritual rhyme of the Spirit Seed, one cannot remain in the Spirit Realm, as this would affect the sect's acquisition of the Spirit Seed."

Shang Rui's gaze now burned with eagerness, looking directly at the mountain cave behind Chu Ning, his voice tinged with excitement. "However, I just happened to learn from other junior brothers that there's a Blazing Wood Twin-Life Fruit here. If I can get help from this fruit, I might even be able to achieve Foundation Establishment directly without needing a Foundation Establishment Pill, and my future achievements would be no worse than those with Heavenly Spirit Roots! To get these spiritual fruits, I waited until you all entered and the directional needle became useful again before I found this place, but I didn't expect you to get there first."

Chu Ning looked at Shang Rui, whose expression kept changing, and continued in a deep voice, "Since Senior Brother only wanted the Blazing Wood Twin-Life Fruit, you could have just asked me for it. Why resort to lethal force?"

"Heh!"

Shang Rui chuckled, shaking his head. "You don't understand the importance of this Spirit Seed to the sect. It is a Heaven and Earth Supreme Treasure that can help Golden Core cultivators enter the Nascent Soul stage. In front of such a treasure, my Foundation Establishment is a trivial matter. If the Sect Master were to know that I obtained the spiritual rhyme and still lingered in this Spirit Realm, and something unexpected happened midway, then I..."

"So you want to silence me?" Chu Ning's heart sank.

Shang Rui slowly nodded, the smile gone from his face, his gaze turning cold as he looked at Chu Ning. "That junior brother who gave me the information, I had to put in a lot of effort to eliminate him without others finding out. Do you think I'll let you leave alive?"

Hearing Shang Rui's words, Chu Ning sighed slightly. "So, only one of us two will leave alive, there's no other choice, is there?"

Upon hearing this, Shang Rui's face again showed a smile, but this smile was full of mockery. "Don't you think it's laughable for a Qi Condensation seventh-layer cultivator like you to say such a thing?"

"I don't think so!" Chu Ning said, raising his hand, a long blade already appearing in it. At the same time, he swung the blade down, and a green light shot towards Shang Rui.

"Verdant Wood Sword Art?"

Shang Rui chuckled, raising his hand casually, and likewise unleashed a similar sword art. The two sword arts collided in mid-air. Even though Chu Ning's attack was empowered by a magic tool, the green light dissipated instantly under Shang Rui's casual strike.

"Ordinary spell attacks are completely ineffective against him." Chu Ning sighed inwardly, experiencing the power of a Perfected Qi Condensation cultivator close to Foundation Establishment for the first time. He still had mid-grade mid-tier talismans on him, but he didn't want to waste too many at this point. After all, the opponent might also have other means. Instead of consuming his resources in a drawn-out fight, it was better to finish it quickly.

Chu Ning retracted his long blade, and a dark, heavy shield appeared in his hand.

Startling Thunder Steps!

At the same time, Chu Ning's figure flickered, and he rushed directly towards Shang Rui.

Shang Rui's face showed a hint of surprise at this moment, but he seemed to have guessed something. His figure flashed, Shang Rui evaded while a layer of fiery shield appeared on his body surface. At the same time, he raised a hand, and a sky full of fireballs rushed towards Chu Ning.

"Sizzle! Sizzle!"

However, these fireballs were blocked directly one zhang outside Chu Ning's body. This was because Chu Ning had already activated defensive talismans. Meanwhile, Chu Ning's speed did not decrease, and he had already charged directly in front of Shang Rui. Blazing Flame Bracer! Tiangang Fist!

Shang Rui seemed a little surprised by Chu Ning's rapid approach. However, when he saw Chu Ning's right fist coming, there was no panic on his face; instead, the mocking expression deepened.

The next moment, Chu Ning's flame-wreathed right fist struck the fiery red magic power shield. However, to his slight surprise, the flame attack from his Blazing Flame Bracer failed to have any offensive effect on Shang Rui's magic power shield. On the contrary, when the blazing flames touched the fiery red shield, they were directly absorbed.

"Playing with fire in front of me?" At the same time, Shang Rui's playful voice rang out.

"Bang!"

Chu Ning, however, ignored it. The latter part of his Tiangang Fist attack still struck the red defensive shield. Immediately, the fiery red defensive shield trembled, looking as if it could shatter at any moment. This somewhat surprised Shang Rui.

"Body cultivator?"

Shang Rui seemed to have guessed something at this moment. He condensed a flame in his right hand and pressed it directly towards Chu Ning, who was right in front of him. But at this moment, Chu Ning did not retreat but advanced, his dark shield directly blocking the flame. His right hand struck out again like lightning, this time without the Blazing Flame Bracer.

"Shatter!" "Shatter!"

A series of flame explosions rang out. There was the sound of Shang Rui's flame shield shattering, and also the sound of his flames hitting the dark shield. At the same time, Chu Ning charged forward fiercely. The dark shield in his left hand, propelled by the forward momentum, heavily slammed into Shang Rui's body.

This collision immediately sent Shang Rui flying backward. At the same time, after losing the resistance of his defensive shield, the immense impact from the shield caused Shang Rui to feel a burst of sharp pain throughout his body.

"Damn it!"

Shang Rui, who had regained his balance, felt his blood and magic power surge. With this single collision, he was actually injured. This undoubtedly caused Shang Rui, who had initially expected to easily subdue Chu Ning and maintain a calm, collected demeanor, to have a drastic change in expression.

"Go to hell!"

Shang Rui looked at Chu Ning, who was charging at him once more. In his extreme frustration, he seemed to have completely lost patience. With a casual flick, a long spear appeared in his hand. The next moment, the long spear glowed with fiery light all over, and a strong fire spiritual energy permeated the surroundings.

"It's your honor to die under this top-tier magic tool, the Fire Phoenix Plume Spear!"

Accompanied by his voice, Shang Rui savagely thrust the spear down at Chu Ning. Instantly, a swath of blazing flames shot towards Chu Ning.

"Top-tier magic tool?"

Feeling the power of the long spear's attack, Chu Ning's heart tightened. Without any hesitation, he immediately activated a mid-grade mid-tier defensive talisman.

Shang Rui was no longer careless at this point. As he unleashed that swath of blazing flames, he himself rushed forward, spear in hand. His speed was no less than Chu Ning's Startling Thunder Steps, and there was even a faint sign of him breaking through the Spirit Realm's restriction and taking flight. However, it looked more like the Fire Phoenix Plume Spear was pulling him along. The Fire Phoenix Plume Spear faintly emitted a phoenix cry.

As he ran, Shang Rui also saw the swath of blazing flames he had unleashed strike Chu Ning's protective shield. And that protective shield merely rippled slightly, completely unharmed.

"Mid-grade mid-tier defensive talisman?"

Shang Rui, surprised that Chu Ning had so many means, flashed a cold sneer. The long spear, imbued with blazing flames, struck heavily onto the white shield. Instantly, this mid-grade mid-tier defensive talisman shattered with a single blow.

"Is this the power of a top-tier magic tool?"

Seeing this, Chu Ning couldn't help but sigh inwardly. This mid-grade mid-tier defensive talisman, which could defend against Foundation Establishment cultivators' spell attacks, couldn't even withstand this spear strike.

His heart was secretly alarmed, but Chu Ning's movements showed no hesitation. His magic power surged directly into the Earth Spirit Bracelet on his left hand. Instantly, a layer of earthy-yellow magic power shield appeared around his body.

Shang Rui's long spear, which he had initially believed would pierce straight through, struck the yellow magic shield but was firmly blocked.

"How is that possible?" Shang Rui looked at this scene, his face filled with utter disbelief. Although this strike had been partially blocked by the mid-grade mid-tier defensive talisman, it certainly wasn't something an ordinary defensive magic tool could block.

"Hmph!" With a light snort, Shang Rui fully infused his magic power into the long spear. Chu Ning's endless array of methods had instinctively made him a little wary. He no longer cared what kind of defense the opponent had; as long as his attacks were relentless, breaking through was only a matter of time.

But at the same time, a sudden chill ran down Shang Rui's spine, an inexplicable feeling of dread rising within him. This feeling typically only appeared when he faced extreme danger.

Shang Rui subconsciously looked at Chu Ning. Then, he saw that in Chu Ning's hand, there was now a small, jet-black knife.

"This is..."

Before Shang Rui could fully make it out, he saw the jet-black knife transform into a dark streak of light, shooting towards him. Instantly, a powerful aura of might pressed down.

"Not good!"

Shang Rui's expression immediately changed drastically. He rapidly wielded his long spear, forming a wall of fire in front of him. At the same time, magic power surged within his body, enveloping him in a fiery glow. This was precisely the protective spell that had just blocked Chu Ning's Blazing Flame Bracer and Tiangang Fist.

Shang Rui's reaction speed was indeed not slow, and coupled with the fact that the jet-black knife's speed wasn't exactly fast, he managed to set up two layers of defense in a short time.

However, all these defenses seemed to offer no obstruction to the dark light. The dark streak pierced through both layers of fire screens, and then, to Shang Rui's horrified gaze, it passed directly through his neck.

The next moment, all the flames on this sect prodigy's body vanished. He fell to the ground, eyes wide with disbelief.

At the same time.

"Clang!"

The long spear, no longer wreathed in flames, fell to the ground.

"So powerful!"

Chu Ning looked at Shang Rui, who clearly died with eyes wide open, then at the jet-black knife stuck in the ground behind him, his eyes sparkling. The defense that his Blazing Flame Bracer plus Tiangang Fist couldn't break through had no defensive capabilities whatsoever in front of this jet-black knife.

No, it even had to include the fire screen from the long spear. Although this spear seemed more like an offensive magic tool, the way Shang Rui used it suggested the fire screen also had some defensive capability. Yet, even with two layers of defense, the jet-black knife broke through them as if effortlessly.

"Tsk, an incomplete Dharma Treasure."

Chu Ning walked to the jet-black knife, which was stuck in the ground, and picked it up. The jet-black knife, which had just drained half of his magic power in one go, had once again lost its spiritual rhyme. Chu Ning tried to infuse a tiny bit of magic power into it, and as expected, it wouldn't enter.

Putting it back into his storage pouch, Chu Ning finally let out a sigh of relief.

"It's a pity this incomplete Dharma Treasure has usage limitations and consumes too much magic power. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to worry at all when facing opponents below the Foundation Establishment stage. Perhaps even Foundation Establishment cultivators might not be able to fully withstand this incomplete Dharma Treasure."

Thinking this, Chu Ning chuckled softly and shook his head.

"It's already very good. If it weren't for this thing, killing Shang Rui would probably have been a huge hassle. All those mid-grade talismans in my pocket would have been almost entirely consumed."

Thinking this, Chu Ning turned to look at Shang Rui's corpse, his expression becoming more solemn. He really hadn't expected that a talented Dual Spirit Root disciple would be so troublesome after reaching the Perfected Qi Condensation realm.

However, the words Shang Rui spoke earlier had given Chu Ning a lot of new information. For instance, the mention of obtaining the spiritual rhyme of the Spirit Seed and being able to rapidly increase strength in a short time. And that the Spirit Seed was effective even for Golden Core cultivators trying to enter the Nascent Soul stage. Then, after obtaining the spiritual rhyme of the Spirit Seed, one had to immediately leave the Spirit Realm.

This immediately opened Chu Ning's mind completely. He had previously been wondering what conditions would allow them to leave the Spirit Realm after the sect arranged for them to enter. Now, Chu Ning at least knew one method: obtaining the spiritual rhyme of the Spirit Seed within.

While these thoughts flashed through his mind, Chu Ning's actions did not stop. His hand directly picked up the top-tier magic tool from beside Shang Rui's corpse.
