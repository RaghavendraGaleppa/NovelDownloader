# Chapter 36: Settling Scores

The flat stone was merely a disguise, concealing within it the world's most advanced timing system along with several chemical substances including white phosphorus.  

The timing mechanism was a spring-driven system composed of multiple gear sets. When the predetermined time was reached, it would trigger the fusion of potassium chlorate and phosphorus, causing a small-scale explosion.  

While the explosive force of potassium chlorate and phosphorus wasn't particularly powerful, it was sufficient to ignite a large quantity of white phosphorus mixture blended with various chemicals.  

The white phosphorus mixture inside the flat stone was formulated based on the composition of military-grade white phosphorus bombs. Had Li Shiming not been concerned about excessive destruction, he would have simply used a fully assembled white phosphorus bomb.  

The power of a white phosphorus bomb was too great. Using his IBM z15 mainframe server, Li Shiming had calculated the precise dosage required to destroy a carriage.  

After observing Prince Shun's carriage, he had computed the exact time it would arrive. As long as the prince's procession maintained its speed, the timing could be accurate to within a second.  

Inside Prince Shun's carriage, the prince and several close aides were chatting when they suddenly heard cries of alarm from outside.  

In the next instant, the entire carriage was engulfed by strange white flames. The fire penetrated the thick wooden and leather walls of the carriage from all sides—bottom, front, back, left, and right—in mere moments.  

This carriage was specially constructed. Its dense, thick wood and treated leather could even withstand armor-piercing arrows from powerful bows.  

Yet against the white phosphorus mixture, it couldn't hold out for even a single breath before being burned through.  

The white flames licked at the occupants of the carriage. Before these flames, status meant nothing—death was the only outcome.  

Li Wenfeng thought of Li Shiming's eyes. In that moment, those eyes seemed to reveal who had burned them to death.  

The four closest bodyguards, despite their formidable skills, had no time to react before the white flames clung to their bodies.  

Instinctively, they tried to smother the flames with their hands, but these were no ordinary fires.  

The white flames clung like maggots to bone, burning through clothing and searing into their skin, relentlessly consuming flesh.  

The four bodyguards could no longer concern themselves with Prince Shun. They were thrown to the ground by their horses, which were also alight with the same white fire.  

The horses instinctively rolled on the ground, trying to extinguish the flames. The bodyguards followed suit, but their efforts were futile.  

Had military-grade white phosphorus mixture been so easily extinguished, it wouldn't have been the terrifying weapon that struck fear into hearts in Li Shiming's previous life.  

"Save the prince!" shouted the cavalrymen who were slightly farther away.  

They ignored the four screaming bodyguards on the ground. These riders were the prince's personal guard—if anything happened to him, they wouldn't survive either.  

Frantically, they tried to pull Prince Shun from the carriage, now a raging white inferno. But anyone who touched the flames immediately caught fire themselves, collapsing to the ground in agony.  

After more than a dozen riders perished, the white flames rapidly diminished and soon died out.  

All that remained of the carriage was a pile of ashes. The carriage and everyone inside had been reduced to charred remains by flames that had no place in this world.  

Only then did the cavalrymen calm down. Staring at the irrecoverable wreckage, they realized the prince could not have survived.  

"Young master, there seems to be a fire behind us!" a guard reported to Li Shiming.  

"Pay it no mind. Continue on our way," Li Shiming ordered sternly.  

The guard knew better than to meddle in Zhongdu's affairs—the political waters here ran too deep.  

Through the rear window, Li Shiming saw a red firework explode in the sky, forming a distinctive pattern.  

Just as his carriage was about to enter the city gates, thunderous hoofbeats erupted from within the walls.  

The gate guards hastily directed Li Shiming's carriage to the side. Moments later, a cavalry unit stormed through the gates.  

"Immortal Gu, this humble ruler has a request." Outside the courtyard gates of a palace residence, Emperor Jin Geng of Great Xia, clad in bright yellow imperial robes, bowed respectfully.  

Beside him stood only his personal eunuch. Had others witnessed this scene, they would have been shocked to see the emperor show such deference.  

"Your Majesty has arrived. Please enter," came Gu Jia's voice from within. The gates swung open of their own accord.  

"Wait here," Jin Geng instructed the eunuch before stepping inside alone.  

Gu Jia sat on a stone stool in the courtyard, reading a book. When the emperor entered, he merely set the volume aside without rising.  

"Immortal Gu, my third son was attacked five li east of the city and has perished. The method of attack was... unnatural, resembling an immortal's technique. I beg your assistance," Jin Geng said, bowing deeply without a trace of imperial arrogance.  

He knew his place well. In the mortal world, he was emperor, the Son of Heaven above all others.  

But this did not apply to immortals—especially not to Gu Jia, a cultivator from the Tianhai Sect. Were it not for the sect's protection, Great Xia would never have enjoyed such enduring stability.  

Every ascending emperor learned one crucial truth: the palace's resident immortal must be respected.  

Gu Jia wasn't surprised by the news. He had been the one to inform Li Shiming of the third prince's movements.  

If a second-level Qi Refining cultivator like Li Shiming couldn't handle a mere prince, he wouldn't deserve the title of cultivator at all.  

"Your Majesty, wait here briefly. I shall return shortly," Gu Jia said, maintaining proper decorum despite knowing the truth.  

He tapped his storage pouch, and a blue light enveloped him as he transformed into a streak of light shooting skyward.  

The distance from the palace to Zhongdu's eastern gate would take half a shichen (one hour) even on horseback. But flying as he was, Gu Jia reached the scene in moments.  

The area was already cordoned off by imperial guards in bright armor. Gu Jia stopped some distance away, presenting a token before approaching.  

When he saw the pile of ashes that had once been a carriage, his first thought was that a cultivator must have been responsible.  

Mortal fires couldn't reduce a carriage and its occupants to such a state—it would require extreme heat.  

But upon closer inspection, he realized his mistake. There wasn't the slightest trace of spiritual energy. This definitely wasn't a cultivator's work.  

Gu Jia found himself impressed with Li Shiming. Whatever method the young man had used to achieve this effect deserved praise.  

It seemed the favor he'd hoped to collect from Li Shiming wouldn't materialize. Shaking his head, Gu Jia turned to leave. Since this wasn't a cultivator's doing, it was none of his concern.
