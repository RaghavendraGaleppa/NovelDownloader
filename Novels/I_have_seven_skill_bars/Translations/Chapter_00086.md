# Chapter 86: Exceptional Talent?

“The direction of fire control, too, serves this very purpose. More precisely, it’s not just about direction, but about adjusting the entire position of the flame. You need to control where the flame burns, and where it heats!”

“When refining some difficult pills, you might even need to split the flame into three, four, or even five clusters to refine different parts separately.”

“As for its size and temperature, that’s because a flame doesn’t burn out of thin air; it requires certain substances to sustain it. By enveloping the flame with your *Yang Condensation Art* true essence, you can easily control its size and temperature by decreasing or increasing its contact with those substances.”

Li Yizhen explained everything very clearly, meticulously detailing the entire process of fire control for Ding Rui.

Upon hearing this, Ding Rui immediately understood. Before his transmigration, he had learned that fire requires oxygen to burn. Thus, by enveloping the flame with his *Yang Condensation Art* true essence and reducing its contact with oxygen, the fire would shrink. Conversely, increasing contact would make it grow. He had never forgotten this principle. Currently, Ding Rui only possessed gaseous true essence, typical of a first-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. However, once he reached the liquid or even solid true essence stages, he would be able to completely seal the flame with his true essence, making his fire control abilities even more powerful.

“I don’t know either,” Li Yizhen said.

“Huh?” Ding Rui turned, his eyes wide.

Li Yizhen looked a little embarrassed, a faint blush appearing on her face, but she calmly continued, “It’s quite normal. Many Pill Hall disciples don’t know the exact mechanism, because for us, our cultivation and true essence are sufficient to forcefully control the flames. While this skill must be mastered, we can gradually learn it later. Our main focus right now is completing alchemy tasks.”

“I see, it seems I’m simply too weak,” Ding Rui nodded, refocusing his attention on the small cluster of flames slowly burning before him.

The fire used by most Pill Hall disciples was very ordinary. Only inner disciples and cultivators capable of refining precious pills were qualified to use other, more specialized flames. And the more specialized the flame, the higher the cultivation requirements. Ding Rui couldn’t even manage this ordinary flame at the moment, so he naturally didn't dare to even think about other special flames. His gaseous true essence was simply too weak, rendering him completely unable to do anything substantial with the burning fire. Ding Rui continuously tried, but with no progress, he couldn't help but scratch his head.

Higher quality pills would undoubtedly fetch more resources, and they were also more effective!

…

Time passed quickly, and it was already dark.

Li Yizhen glanced outside, then shook her head and said, “Alright, you can go practice fire control on your own. Just light a fire anywhere and try. Be careful not to get so frustrated that you try to grab it with your hands, because that won’t help.”

“Let’s move on to the next thing. Today, I want you to try out the entire process. After this, anything that can be practiced privately, you can go practice on your own.”

Hearing this, Ding Rui could only stop. Although he wanted to continue trying, he knew that he wouldn’t achieve any significant results in the short term.
