# Chapter 100: Storming the Prison, Distorting Truth  

The bustling streets of the capital were alive with activity.  

The little dragon girl looked around with delight, while Li Zhengjing frowned slightly. Since entering the city, he had felt numerous eyes upon him. His reputation had grown recently, and many recognized him.  

This time, he hadn’t bothered to conceal his identity, though he had no intention of openly associating with the Jian'an Marquis's household. If trouble arose later, he didn’t want his family implicated.  

"I knew the capital was seething with undercurrents, but I didn’t expect the Jian'an Marquis's household to be targeted so soon," Li Zhengjing mused, hands behind his back. He had already confirmed that this matter was aimed at his family and had been planned for some time.  

A month ago, Guo Xinnu had taken his family out for an excursion. His carriage blocked the main road, forcing a passing woodcutter to take a side path, where he was buried in a landslide.  

Upon hearing of the incident, Guo Xinnu mocked the woodcutter, calling him foolish for taking the dangerous path and claiming he deserved his fate.  

Li Pu, who happened to be leaving the capital on orders, intervened, arguing that while the woodcutter had made a poor choice, he didn’t deserve such scorn in death.  

Guo Xinnu flew into a rage, hurling insults at Li Pu. From that moment, their feud began.  

A month later, Guo Xinnu’s entire family was slaughtered last night, and today, he himself was killed outside the city by Li Pu’s trusted subordinate.  

Now, Li Yun had been arrested and directly accused Li Pu of ordering the murders.  

"Eldest Brother has always been kind-hearted. He wouldn’t wipe out Guo Xinnu’s family over something like this," Jia Shifang whispered. "If anything, he might have stood up for the woodcutter and humiliated that old fool Guo Xinnu in the city. But killing him? Slaughtering his entire family? Impossible!"  

"But they believe Eldest Brother is the prime suspect, and Li Yun is his trusted subordinate. I’m sure they’ve prepared witnesses and evidence to seal the case," Li Zhengjing said, stroking his chin. "What has Eldest Brother done since the Crown Prince’s death?"  

"I looked into it earlier," Jia Shifang replied quietly. "Fourteen days after the Crown Prince’s death, the Third Prince’s residence caught fire, killing many. Eldest Brother led a pursuit and shot the arsonist, earning a promotion to Deputy Commander."  

"The arsonist?" Li Zhengjing glanced at him.  

"His identity was unknown," Jia Shifang said.  

"Can we find out?" Li Zhengjing asked coolly.  

"Not enough money," Jia Shifang admitted. "If I send for funds and grease some palms, I might uncover something."  

"Go, then," Li Zhengjing said. "Leave the money you have—your niece needs snacks. And don’t draw attention. You’re here to take the spy exam, after all."  

"Got it." Jia Shifang handed over his silver notes, checked his bearings, and headed toward the Jia family’s pharmacy.  

"Aren’t you going home?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked. "With your current strength, unless the Imperial Preceptor is watching you, you could easily shake off any surveillance and return to the Jian'an Marquis's residence in secret."  

"Let’s save Eldest Brother first," Li Zhengjing said. "Since Li Yun betrayed him, there must be a reason. We’ll start with Li Yun’s family."  

Li Yun was his elder brother’s trusted subordinate, and Li Zhengjing knew him well. He followed the path to Li Yun’s home and immediately understood the situation.  

"Li Yun’s household has nine people. I remember he had a family of four. The other four have strong auras—they’ve trained in external martial arts. The last one is at the initial Qi Refinement stage?"  

"It seems he wasn’t bribed with money but coerced by having his family taken hostage."  

"Fine. Hanging Wall, A’Shu."  

Li Zhengjing waved his hand. "Handle this."  

With that, he released his Qi, enveloping the house.  

The Five Elements Creation Tree scaled the wall with its countless roots, while the Hanging Wall Bird took flight. Flames erupted inside, and the screams ceased in an instant.  

Li Zhengjing pushed open the door. The Five Elements Creation Tree had bound five people with its branches, their faces charred beyond recognition.  

"Young Master?"  

Li Yun’s family stared at him in shock.  

"Go inside, pack up, and leave the capital. This matter doesn’t concern you anymore," Li Zhengjing said.  

"But what about Li Yun?" a woman asked hesitantly.  

"I recall your son can write. Have him pen a letter, and I’ll deliver it to reassure Li Yun," Li Zhengjing replied.  

"Thank you, Young Master!" The entire family bowed, tears streaming down their faces.  

"Go."  

Li Zhengjing approached the Qi Refinement cultivator. "I don’t recognize you. Which prince recently recruited you?"  

The man remained silent, his expression grim.  

"Make him talk," Li Zhengjing said, glancing at the tree and the bird. "Who’s better at torture?"  

The Hanging Wall Bird raised a wing. "Me! I’m learned in all arts!"  

The Five Elements Creation Tree didn’t speak. Its branches burrowed into the five captives’ flesh like serpents, writhing and probing.  

Soon, someone cracked.  

"The Third Prince’s man?"  

Li Zhengjing fell silent. In his memory, his elder brother was closest to the Third Prince.  

Back when the Crown Prince was alive, his ambition and talent had awed all his brothers. After his death, the princes must have turned on each other, each vying for the throne.  

If that was the case, the Jian'an Marquis's household likely supported the Third Prince. Moreover, Li Pu’s promotion had come after he shot the arsonist at the Third Prince’s residence.  

So why would the Third Prince target him?  

After extracting the truth, Li Zhengjing remained silent.  

"Three days ago, the Seventh Prince died of illness—though his death was kept secret. In truth, he lost the power struggle and was cornered by the Third Prince. He took his own life!" the Qi Refinement cultivator stammered. "But Li Pu, under the Third Prince’s orders, delivered the Seventh Prince’s head to the palace!"  

"And then?" Li Zhengjing asked.  

"With the succession settled, the Third Prince emerged victorious and will become the Crown Prince!" the man said through gritted teeth. "Though the princes fought fiercely, they spared each other’s lives—except for the Seventh Prince, who died by his own hand."  

"If he’s about to become Crown Prince, why kill my brother?" Li Zhengjing pressed.  

"The Emperor’s condition," the man whispered. "Li Pu desecrated the Seventh Prince’s corpse. His crime warrants execution! The Emperor demands Li Pu’s body be placed beneath the Seventh Prince’s coffin before he’ll proclaim the Third Prince as heir."  

"A mere Li Pu is nothing compared to the throne," Li Zhengjing mused. "Since the Seventh Prince killed himself, they needed another crime to pin on my brother?"  

"Exactly," the man confirmed. "The Guo Xinnu family were the Seventh Prince’s old allies. They were fleeing the capital, so they were slaughtered to seal the case."  

"The Third Prince is ruthless!"  

Li Zhengjing laughed coldly, then looked skyward. "I thought gathering evidence and witnesses would clear my brother’s name. But with both the current and future emperors determined to kill him, the officials have no choice but to convict him."  

He flicked his fingers, and the Five Elements Creation Tree silenced the five captives permanently.  

"What now?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked. "This is the capital, home to multiple human-immortal-level experts and the Imperial Preceptor. Causing trouble here is like stirring chaos in the heart of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Only someone like the Debt Collector could escape unscathed."  

"The fake medicine peddler said the Hall-Suppressing Dragon Pillar can save lives."  

Li Zhengjing checked the golden page’s fortune prediction:  

**Fortune:** Assuming the identity of the Impermanent Ghost Face and wielding the Hall-Suppressing Dragon Pillar to storm the prison and rescue Li Pu. Midway, the Imperial Preceptor gathers the nation’s fortune and strikes you dead!  

**Method to Alter Fate:** …Insufficient spiritual energy!  

Li Zhengjing swallowed twelve spirit stones.  

**Fortune:** Revealing your true identity as Li Zhengjing, sweeping through all obstacles, breaking into the prison, rescuing Li Pu, and returning home to reunite with your parents. Share tea and a meal, then bathe and change into elegant attire, appearing composed and dashing.  

"What nonsense is this?" Li Zhengjing muttered, baffled. "Is this fortune-telling serious?"  

Shaking his head, he instructed the Hanging Wall Bird, the Five Elements Creation Tree, and the little dragon girl to wait for Jia Shifang.  

Taking Yuan Zhengfeng’s jade fragment as a precaution, he headed straight for the prison.  

"Imperial Prison—halt!"  

"Halt my ass!"  

Li Zhengjing drew his blade and unleashed a thunderous strike, carving a path forward.  

He fought his way in, cutting down the peak Qi Refinement expert guarding the entrance and scattering the other jailers without hesitation.  

Suddenly, a treasure’s power surged above.  

The Prison-Suppressing Divine Beast opened its eyes, radiating terrifying pressure. Any peak Qi Refinement expert below the human-immortal level would flee in terror!  

But Li Zhengjing raised his left arm and unleashed a Divine Fire technique, shattering it instantly!  

The prison’s formations were formidable, but they couldn’t stop him.  

"The prison is heavily guarded. Only a human-immortal could break in," Yuan Zhengfeng remarked. "If a human-immortal storms the prison, no defense can stop them. But it will alert the capital’s guardians."  

"Let them come!" Li Zhengjing swallowed Yuan Zhengfeng’s jade fragment, borrowing human-immortal strength to cut through the outer guards and reach Li Pu’s cell.  

Li Pu sat inside, shackled and despondent.  

Hearing the commotion, he looked up, revealing a handsome face twisted in shock. "Second Brother?"  

"Save the talk. Let’s go home."  

Li Zhengjing slashed through the chains—specialized restraints, but no match for human-immortal power.  

"What are you doing?" Li Pu protested. "They only want my life. If you break me out, our family will suffer."  

"Would you rather die?" Li Zhengjing grabbed him. "Come on!"  

"But—"  

"No buts. I heard you didn’t hesitate when you beheaded the Seventh Prince."  

With that, Li Zhengjing fought his way out of the prison.  

Twelve peak Qi Refinement experts guarded the prison, but Li Zhengjing defeated them all.  

He marched through the streets with Li Pu in prison garb, repelling all attempts to stop him, and returned to the Jian'an Marquis's residence.  

"You’ve brought disaster home!" Li Pu said grimly.  

"Go see Father and Mother. They’ve been worried sick all day."  

Upon entering, the servants gasped in shock. Inside, weeping could be heard.  

The Marquis and his wife were in tears, especially Lady Jia, who was nearly inconsolable.  

"Father, Mother, I’m back," Li Pu said, breaking down.  

"My son, how did you escape?" Lady Jia cried joyfully, clutching his hand.  

Li Pu hesitated, about to explain, when his parents’ eyes shifted behind him to Li Zhengjing—and they froze as if struck by lightning.  

Li Zhengjing stepped forward and bowed with a smile. "I broke into the prison and rescued Eldest Brother."  

"What?"  

The Marquis trembled. "You dared storm the Imperial Prison?"  

Li Zhengjing shrugged. "If I didn’t, Eldest Brother would be dead."  

The Marquis paled. "But now the entire Jian'an Marquis's household will be executed for this! Didn’t I tell you not to return to the capital unless summoned?"  

Li Zhengjing spread his hands. "But I had nowhere left in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. I’ve grown stronger, so I came back."  

"Grown stronger? In just a year? Do you know how many experts lurk in the capital?"  

The Marquis suddenly stiffened, his eyes widening in horror. "You broke into the prison after just a year of cultivation?"  

Li Zhengjing checked the golden page’s fortune and smiled. "We’ll talk later. I need a bath and a change of clothes first. Then we’ll have tea."  

The Marquis turned even paler. "You committed a capital offense, and you’re worried about changing clothes and drinking tea? We need to flee immediately!"  

"Relax."  

Without another word, Li Zhengjing dashed to the rear courtyard.  

Yuan Zhengfeng’s voice echoed in his mind.  

"Your father isn’t the scholar I once knew."  

"Years ago, I met a young scholar during my travels. We shared many interests."  

"But he had no desire for immortality. He wanted to serve the people, to govern justly and purge corruption."  

"Impressed by his integrity, I gave him a token, promising his descendants a chance at immortality."  

"How did it end up with your father, sending you to the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect?"  

Li Zhengjing explained.  

The scholar had indeed become a county magistrate, but within a year, he was convicted of corruption, sentenced to death, and his family was to be executed.  

Desperate, his family offered the Feather Transformation Sect token to the Jian'an Marquis's household in exchange for protection. Though the scholar was executed, his family was spared.  

The token had remained with the Marquis ever since.  

"So he truly abandoned his principles and became corrupt?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked.  

"Who knows?"  

Li Zhengjing set the jade fragment aside, bathed, and changed into fresh robes. As he fastened the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Blade to his waist, Yuan Zhengfeng spoke again.  

"Two human-immortals have surrounded the residence. Nearly a thousand imperial guards are closing in."  

Li Zhengjing checked his fortune and grinned. "Let’s go see."  

He returned to the front courtyard, where his parents and brother stood pale-faced, certain doom looming over them.  

Ahead, a human-immortal expert strode forward, his aura overwhelming.  

General Fang Yin, one of the capital’s four divine generals, stood clad in armor, his power amplified by the thousand elite soldiers behind him.  

"Li Zhengjing, you dare storm the prison and return here, spitting in the face of the capital’s defenders!"  

"Storm the prison? I was rescuing someone!"  

"Enough! Surrender now, or we raze the Jian'an Marquis's residence to the ground!"  

Fang Yin glared. "The world knows Li Zhengjing of the Feather Transformation Sect, the thief who stole spirit stones and fled. Did you think the capital’s defenses would bow to you?"  

His voice turned icy. "Half a year ago, the Crown Prince fell ill from poison. Your family claimed the second son died of the same poison—yet here he stands! Did you conspire with the Venom King Xin Xuan? Was your massacre in Siyecheng to silence witnesses?"  

Li Zhengjing tightened his grip on his blade and glanced at his father.  

The Marquis sighed. Back then, Li Zhengjing had been on the verge of death but miraculously recovered. Meanwhile, the Crown Prince had succumbed to poison.  

Had the Emperor learned of Li Zhengjing’s survival, he would have used him as a test subject—or worse, as medicine to cure the Crown Prince.  

To protect his son, the Marquis had secretly sent him away, declaring him dead. With the Crown Prince’s illness, the capital was a powder keg. If the Marquis backed the wrong prince, his family would perish.  

Sending Li Zhengjing away had been to preserve the family line.  

But now his return had exposed the truth.  

Just as the Marquis was about to speak, a voice rang out from outside.  

"I believe the prison was breached by another party. Li Zhengjing was there to aid the wounded."  

A young Daoist in robes stepped forward, his expression solemn. "And who says Li Zhengjing is the Jian'an Marquis's second son? His name is Li Erpu, registered in the Ministry of Revenue—and a close friend of the Imperial Preceptor!"  

Silence fell.  

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin, marveling at the golden page’s prediction. "Unbelievable."  

The young Daoist studied Li Zhengjing approvingly. *Storming the prison, unshaken in the face of danger, returning home composed and impeccably dressed—his talent truly is peerless, just as the Imperial Preceptor said!*
