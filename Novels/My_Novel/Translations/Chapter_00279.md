# Chapter 279: The Grand Gathering Opens, the Flowing Gaze Dress, the List of Heroes, and Li Xian’s Arrival

The Flower Cage Sect has five branch altars, each representing one of the Five Elements. The Water Altar is located within the Dongran Lake in Huaiyin Prefecture, Yu’nan Dao. This is a closely guarded secret; only the elders know its approximate location. One must be received by a Ferrying Emissary to enter the altar’s mouth.

The red smoke was named "Clear Drifting Sleep Fragrance." It was meticulously refined from various common materials: Red胭脂花 (Red胭脂花), Calming Grass, Stone Powder, Blue Pool Lotus Stamen, Moon-Longing Fruit...

"Common materials" were actually not cheap. Li Xian’s "Tiger Saliva Stone" and "Golden Leopard Sinew" already possessed miraculous effects, yet they still belonged to the category of "common materials." In the mouths of martial artists, "common materials" refer to ordinary treasures that possess miraculous effects but are not enough to be called "rare worldly treasures" passed down through generations.

Clear Drifting Sleep Fragrance... its scent is gentle and aids sleep. It soothes anxiety and calms the mind. It is an excellent medicinal smoke. However, it requires precise "timing." Used at the Hai period (9-11 PM), the medicinal effect is excellent, and the healing power is doubled.

If used at the Zi period (11 PM - 1 AM), it is completely different. The three main herbs—Red胭脂花, Blue Pool Lotus Stamen, and Moon-Longing Fruit—all change their medicinal properties according to the time. At Zi hour, the properties of Red胭脂花 and Moon-Longing Fruit clash like fire and water, while the Blue Pool Lotus Stamen acts as a mediator.

The medicinal effect changes instantly. Although it still possesses the essential benefit of aiding sleep and calming the mind, it more strongly stimulates miscellaneous thoughts and subtly increases one's desires and interests.

These miscellaneous thoughts cover a wide range. They can be about martial arts, love, the past... all sorts of things. But a person's miscellaneous thoughts often change according to their circumstances and situation.

The layout of the bedroom, in particular, subtly guides one's miscellaneous thoughts toward matters of pleasure and intimacy. The books arranged on the shelves are all types of romantic biographies.

Nangong Liuli had gradually adapted to sleeping every night with the sleep fragrance. After she felt herself becoming increasingly irritable, she spent a whole night carefully analyzing the red smoke's ingredients and managed to discern the main herbs like Red胭脂花 and Blue Pool Lotus Stamen. She vaguely guessed the red smoke's effect and cursed, "If these evil thieves and lustful men had directly used an aphrodisiac, I would have praised them for their true nature. At least they would be honest villains. Hmph. But they had to use this improper sleep fragrance."

"My heart is pure. Do I have anything to fear?"

『Clear Drifting Sleep Fragrance』, though originating from the Flower Cage Sect, is a legitimate medicinal product sold in many places. It has the effect of healing heart wounds.

After smelling it for several days, the sleep fragrance originally did not add to lustful thoughts. But unfortunately, she herself possessed such thoughts. They accumulated in her heart, making her feel more and more agitated and resentful.

That day... she inadvertently glanced at the sandalwood box on the vanity table again. Thinking of the items inside, her pretty face suddenly flushed red. Although she had felt something strange before, she hadn't thought much of it and never made such associations. In that instant, certain images flashed through her mind, and she suddenly understood its purpose.

This time, she was too ashamed to face anyone. She exclaimed in terror, "The Flower Cage Sect... how... how could they make such strange things?" She fled far away, trying to avoid looking, fearing that if her gaze fell on the sandalwood box, it would dirty her eyes.

Dazed, another few days passed. Her cheeks were slightly flushed. She clearly knew that "Clear Drifting Sleep Fragrance" was not a lust-inducing drug, but she couldn't stop cursing it and had to attribute the changes to it.

In reality, "Clear Drifting Sleep Fragrance" has the characteristic of "the pure remain pure, the turbid remain turbid." Those with no desires or demands, upon smelling the fragrance and sleeping, would benefit endlessly. Those with heavy desires and demands, upon smelling it, would find their desires insatiable.

She glanced at the vanity table, her mind in a haze:

"I have come here, and this life is hopeless. Why bother with clan rules and teachings? Rather than being forced by those thieves, I might as well... Ah! What am I thinking? How could I think like this... This is really terrible. This place is extremely strange."

She tightly pursed her lips, struggling slightly. Feeling unable to move, she felt a slight sense of relief: "Luckily, I am tied up and cannot move, so I won't do anything strange. Wait... being tied up has become a good thing?"

"Damn Flower Cage Sect!"

Her thoughts raced, and she always felt restless. After lying in bed for a while, she bounced down again. Looking left and right, she wanted to find something to distract her mind.

Her heart was turbulent, and she thought of the young thief in the prison who fed her. She had never seen his face clearly, but in her memory, it was hazy, as if adding a unique charm.

She endured this bitter suffering for a long time, passing several more days in isolation. Every day was sleeping and dazing... nothing else. Precisely because she was extremely bored, her mind became active.

She originally wanted to focus her thoughts on martial arts moves. However, drifting and floating, she always thought of other things. Her interest in martial arts was not strong; since childhood, she was bound by clan rules and etiquette, dignified and proper.

Everyone envied her beauty as the noble daughter of the Nangong family, with a prominent background.

Now that she had been captured, her clan's trace was gone, and the rules vanished. She felt as if she had broken free from a cage. Though her body was bound, she felt a sense of freedom. She clearly knew this feeling was wrong, but Clear Drifting Sleep Fragrance only guided her miscellaneous thoughts, drawing out deeper thoughts.

These were all her original thoughts.

But her disgust towards the Flower Cage Sect was also genuine. At this moment, her feelings were mixed and extremely complicated.

Suddenly, the door opened. Four women in black dresses, with exquisite makeup and beautiful looks, walked into the room, giggling.

Nangong Liuli turned her head away. The four women laughed and said, "You still say you're not a little slut? Why is your face so red?" Nangong Liuli said, "I wish I could kill you!"

One woman said, "Oh dear, oh dear. You know what you're thinking, we won't argue with you."

Nangong Liuli had anger with nowhere to vent, secretly annoyed at her own lack of willpower. She had been turned into this state by the Clear Drifting Sleep Fragrance. One woman said, "Alright, sisters, stop teasing her. The grand gathering has already started. We need to prepare the prize properly."

Nangong Liuli exclaimed in shock, "What? The grand gathering has already started? How long has it been?"

The four women looked at each other, giggling and said playfully, "It's been a long time. You... quickly follow us. Since you are the prize, we'll allow you to see this grand gathering."

Nangong Liuli was ashamed and angry, unwilling to comply. She secretly used the "Thousand Jun Drop" martial art, her feet taking root, sinking deep into the ground, not moving an inch.

The four women knew she was resisting and laughed, "At this point, resistance is useless. Since you're not being obedient, don't blame us." Their figures were like shadows, surrounding her in an instant, saying, "If you don't retract your energy, I'll use the『Soft Wind One Finger』?"

Nangong Liuli quickly retracted her energy, gritting her silver teeth, she could only temporarily endure the hatred. "The situation is stronger than the person. I'll go with you." The four women suddenly laughed, "Even if you retract your energy, we didn't say we wouldn't use it."

Four fingers struck out simultaneously. They tapped on Nangong Liuli's spine, ribs, and abdomen. Her eyes widened,来不及 to be angry, she let out a惨 cry and was completely paralyzed. She was then carried out of the room by the four women.

Nangong Liuli's eyes were moist. The events of the past few days could be described as extreme humiliation. The finger technique she suffered was something her internal energy could not resist, causing her to tremble slightly. She also had to listen to the teasing and mocking words of the four women.

About half an hour later, they arrived at a room. There was a finely polished silver mirror that could reflect her entire appearance and show the details of her face.

The four women admired, "This girl has a good background, a beautiful face, and a first-class figure. Sigh... the four of us sisters are inferior to her."

Nangong Liuli pursed her lips and tried to stay calm, not speaking. The four streams of finger energy passed along her spine, as if mixed with some medicinal power. It was truly like "touching the bone and it melts, touching the heart and it softens, touching the flesh and it numbs..."

They arrived at a warm pool, steaming with hot vapor. The four women undressed her and allowed her to enter the pool to wash her body. Nangong Liuli stepped on the bottom of the pool, her whole body relaxed. She looked around curiously. The four women stood at the four corners of the pool, guarding against Nangong Liuli's resistance.

At this point, Nangong Liuli was deep in the thieves' den and felt there was no escape. So she relaxed and enjoyed the bath. Her pretty face was slightly red. Since her capture, bathing had become a luxury. The prison at the bottom of the ship was hot and dark; she sweated like rain, her clothes drying and getting wet again. Martial artists are ultimately "human," and they have their own embarrassments.

Later, she was locked in the bedroom. The situation improved a lot, but it was still difficult to wash. Combined with the frequent rise of miscellaneous thoughts, it was truly like a deep boudoir locked with spring desire.

Just like the beautiful scenery of early spring, lush fragrant grass, misty water vapor, and spring dew about to drip.

She didn't care about the floods or the imminent disaster. After washing, the four women brought a宽 towel, she simply wrapped it around herself, her long hair like a waterfall.

The four women laughed, "You're lucky. The higher-ups have granted permission. We specially prepared the Flowing Gaze Dress for you."

Then they took out a wooden box. Opening the box, inside was a set of exquisite clothing. It was fabric imported from the Western Regions, feeling like gauze or silk, woven carefully. The four women took out the clothes; it was a dress with complete accessories: silver hairpins, earrings, shoes and socks, sachets, pearl strings... counting them carefully, there were many accessories never seen before.

The candlelight shone, and the many accessories reflected each other, with colorful light spots flowing. The four women touched the fabric and said with ill intent, "You little girl... wearing this dress, you'll have good fortune."

Nangong Liuli, at first glance, saw the clothes were magnificent and didn't reject them. But upon closer inspection, she felt a tremor all over and wanted to flee. Inside the clothes were hidden fine毛 needles. Once worn, they would surely pierce her skin. But the needles were extremely fine, so they probably wouldn't feel painful.

Looking closer... the Flowing Gaze Dress fit Nangong Liuli's figure perfectly. The positions of the fine needles must correspond to the acupoints on her body. These acupoints were all targeted at the martial arts she practiced. If she wore it, her acupoints would be firmly controlled.

Then she would be powerless to turn the tide, at the mercy of others.

The four women said, "This is woven from pure jade silk from the Western Regions. This kind of silk doesn't stain dirt. Even after wearing it for several years, it won't get dirty or messy."

It turned out the Flower Cage Sect was extremely skilled in lewd and cunning techniques. This set of clothing was a masterpiece of ingenuity, hiding a trap within. Its beautiful appearance concealed a predicament.

Nangong Liuli fought back fiercely. But unfortunately, her state was weak, and although the four women's martial arts were not as good as hers, they joined forces and used the Soft Wind One Finger. Nangong Liuli could not cope.

After a moment of anxious struggle, Nangong Liuli said in a deep voice, "Alright... I'll wear this dress!" She could only swallow her anger and temporarily endure. She began to dress, putting on the lightweight socks. Throughout the process, she didn't feel the fine needles.

But the moment she finished dressing, her acupoints were restrained, and her strength was drained by seventy percent. She tried to circulate her internal energy. When the energy passed through several major acupoints, it was dispersed by an invisible force. Or it was blocked,难以 to cross the chasm.

She could still use her internal energy, but she had to avoid the important acupoints. The meridians through which the energy traveled were narrow and remote. She couldn't use martial arts, which was no different from having no internal energy at all.

It was like two armies fighting, and the logistics transporting supplies. The wide roads were all blocked. The supplies had to take a long detour, or even abandon carts and horses, carrying grain over mountain paths. By the time the supplies arrived, the front army had already been defeated.

She had truly become a delicate woman, at the mercy of others.

Moreover, the basic acupoints controlled by the fine needles in the clothes were combined with each other, creating another妙 effect, combined with the miscellaneous thoughts stirred up by the "Clear Drifting Sleep Fragrance."

With the Flowing Gaze Dress on, her beautiful eyes流盼.

Her expression was strange, and she was suffering unbearably.

The four women said, "Don't rush, there's still some makeup. You don't think it ends here, do you?" Nangong Liuli cried inwardly, thinking, "Oh dear... there's still makeup... I... I can't live anymore!"

At this point, she was even less of a match. They did her makeup, applied lipstick... making her up exquisitely. With cloud-like hair and phoenix hairpins, she transformed... though her eyes hid anger, her appearance was extremely exquisite.

She looked as if she had been invited to a banquet.

Nangong Liuli was full of shame and anger. But looking in the mirror, she was extremely beautiful. Her hair was like ink, her figure graceful.

Seeing this scene, Nangong Liuli finally felt a slight comfort. When she moved slightly, her moth-like brows furrowed, feeling something strange. The fine needles hidden in the clothes pierced into her skin. Her slight movements pulled on the entire garment, which in turn tugged on the fine needles.

It produced a miraculous effect. The ribs, the Yongquan acupoints on the soles of the feet, and many acupoints on the back felt as if ants were biting them. Her whole body felt as if it had undergone dozens of Soft Wind One Finger attacks.

Nangong Liuli stood frozen in place, even breathing had to be done carefully. The four women teased, "Good girl, come with us." Nangong Liuli tried to take a half-step.

She couldn't help but let out an "Ah" and dared not move. Her beautiful eyes流盼, looking at the four women for help.

The four women said, "Oh right, we forgot to teach you the footwork. This set of clothing requires corresponding footwork to walk."

Since the four women taught the footwork, Nangong Liuli dared not disobey and learned according to the steps. Taking a light step, it was indeed effective. But her posture was slightly provocative, and she could only suppress her embarrassment.

After practicing for half an hour, Nangong Liuli could walk without hindrance, but her speed was very slow. The four women nodded secretly; the task was complete. They immediately took Nangong Liuli and walked slowly out of the building.

Nangong Liuli sighed repeatedly. She could only follow. Seeing the bright sun in the sky, she had no heart to watch. She thought, "The Flower Cage Sect has a long history. If that woman had fallen into this situation, she would also be hopeless. The situation is stronger than the person. I might as well endure it temporarily to make it a bit easier."

After walking for half an hour, Nangong Liuli was so tired she was covered in sweat. The Flowing Gaze Dress was exquisite, but it didn't breathe or absorb sweat, as if deliberately making her suffer. Moreover, this footwork was extremely tiring both physically and mentally, and the speed was slow.

Nangong Liuli said, "Where are we going? Haven't we arrived yet?"

The four women said, "Are you impatient?" Nangong Liuli's face flushed red, and she gritted her silver teeth. She hated the Flower Cage Sect to the core, but she was indeed restless and very strange.

After walking slowly for another half hour, Nangong Liuli was so tired she wanted to crawl and rest. But the Flowing Gaze Dress wouldn't allow her to do anything else. She had to maintain her posture, arching her back and chest, walking slowly, maintaining her graceful charm.

She felt as if the sky and earth were spinning, not knowing how long they had walked. They entered a room with a red wood chair. The four women said, "Go sit down."

Nangong Liuli was covered in sweat and extremely exhausted. She immediately walked over and sat down. In an instant, she牵动 the fine needles at her acupoints and felt completely powerless.

She thought, "These thieves are playing with me. I'm wearing this clothing. Even walking requires 'careful calculation.' Without the specific method, if I sit down, I'll pull the fine needles."

She said weakly, "Bastard..." The four women said, "Hmph, you little slut, who did you offend? You had to offend us."

The four women laughed, "This Flowing Gaze Dress has a way to sit and a way to walk. The four of us sisters can't stand your arrogant face. If you behave well now and call us 'good sisters,' we'll teach you all the secrets of walking and sitting. Although you can't use martial arts, you can still move around without hindrance. It's a bit troublesome, but it's much better."

Nangong Liuli said, "In your dreams."

The four women said, "In that case, endure it yourself." The four women turned and left, closing the door.

Nangong Liuli's heart cried bitter tears. Hearing the door close, she secretly regretted it. She wanted to turn her head, but didn't dare to move.

"I was impulsive again. This is terrible. In this state, walking and sitting are both problems." She sat upright in the chair, not daring to move at all. Suddenly, light shone in... in front of her was a huge glass mirror.

Below were eight arenas. The surroundings were packed with thousands of spectators, extremely lively, all belonging to the Flower Cage Sect thieves.

Nangong Liuli took a few deep breaths, barely suppressing her agitation, and stared intently at the arenas. It had been a long time since she had seen other people.

The grand gathering was in full swing, at its most intense. The sound of fists and feet, the sound of verbal abuse, the shouting of the crowd... all entered Nangong Liuli's ears. Her gaze wandered, looking for a certain figure.

"Over there!"

Nangong Liuli gradually saw.

She saw a figure lying on a tree branch tens of丈 away from the arena, leisurely chewing on a straw. Nangong Liuli felt an unexplained anger rise, thinking of her own situation. In her anger and despair, she turned her gaze away.

The Flower Cage Sect was skilled in miscellaneous arts, but their martial arts were slightly weaker. Nangong Liuli was filled with complex emotions. She knew her fate; today she would fall into the hands of one of them.

Seeing the martial artists on the arena, although their martial arts were not weak, Nangong Liuli came from a noble family since childhood. At clan banquets and grand festivals, she had seen peers sparring. Many talents she saw could easily crush ninety percent of the people here.

"Do I still expect the Flower Cage Sect to produce a true dragon? These thieves rolling in the mud, no matter how strong their strength, what does it have to do with me? Hmph. That Hua Wucoo is timid as a rat. His strength is actually decent. If... he really fought for me. Even if he lost, I would remember his kindness. My heart has nowhere to settle, it will end up on him anyway. But he won't even do that..."

Thinking of this, tears fell. She felt an inexplicable sense of grievance.

Her gaze was suddenly attracted by an arena. The Flower Cage Sect's Wang Changjiang struck out a move, and actually produced three "ethereal fairy sounds" at once. His opponent was instantly defeated, tumbling out of the arena, unconscious.

Nangong Liuli's beautiful eyes narrowed slightly and said, "This person is quite厉害."

This Wang Changjiang was already thirty-five years old. Nangong Liuli was twenty. On the path of martial arts, the older one is, the more refined. Eating fine food for more years, practicing martial arts for more years, accumulating experience for more years, is naturally a huge advantage.

There is a saying in the Jianghu: "Better to offend a young hero than an old crafty one." It means some martial artists, although their martial arts realm is ordinary, are old and crafty, with means beyond their realm.

At Nangong family banquets, sparring among peers was limited to a "three-year" difference. If the age difference was three years, one had to carefully consider the sparring. "Bullying the young with the old" is not honorable, and "bullying the old with the young" is even more humiliating.

Nangong Liuli once competed in music with a cousin four years her senior at a clan banquet. The music contained insights into martial arts. After winning, she didn't dare to be overbearing.

Unconsciously, she recalled the glory of the past. Walking in the Jianghu, there is only the distinction between strong and weak, rarely between old and young. Her praise was also genuine.

In a distant pavilion.

The Flower Cage Sect's "Water Altar Chief Emissary" Shi Yufei, Water Altar Deputy Envoy Yan Hao, Water Altar Ferrying Emissary Jin Shichang, Flower Cage Sect Elders Ye Cheng, Liu Yu, Meng Han... all watched the scenes on the arenas.

Seeing Wang Changjiang defeat his opponent in one move, they all nodded frequently, quite appreciative. Shi Yufei said, "This junior Wang Changjiang can be considered an outstanding talent of my Flower Cage Sect."

Water Altar Deputy Envoy Yan Hao said, "In one move, he played the 'Enchanting Fairy Sound,' 'Strengthening Energy Fairy Sound,' and 'Drumming Fairy Sound,' showing that his martial arts are well-planned. He has figured out his own path."

Jin Shichang said, "In this grand gathering, this child can compete for the top prize."

Shi Yufei sighed, "Ah..."

Flower Cage Sect Elder Liu Yu asked, "Why does the Chief Emissary sigh?" Shi Yufei said, "This Wang Changjiang is indeed quite good. But he's always a bit lacking in flavor. I don't find him very satisfactory."

Meng Han said, "My Flower Cage Sect still has Wolf Blade, Bao Zhi贤, Ding ZeLin and other talented juniors. They are all quite good candidates."

Shi Yufei said, "The current situation is different. The dynasty is declining, and chaos is rising everywhere. Heroes emerge in large numbers. Noble families and clans all focus on nurturing talented juniors. They select those who enter the lists to increase their family's influence."

"The talents you mentioned, can they enter the lists?"

There are four major lists in the world: List of Heroes, List of Beauties, List of Divine Weapons, and the Red List. The lists are set into three levels: Heaven, Earth, and Human. The List of Heroes is highly concerned by all heroes. Those who ascend the list are all among the dragons and phoenixes of men.

The list does not set an age limit, purely based on aura, martial arts, and influence. The Earth List corresponds to heroes in the "Dao" level, and the Human List corresponds to heroes at the "Prefecture" or "State" level, which is one level lower.

Those who can登临 the "Human List" at the age of twenty have a high reputation and great influence. Li Xian was once selected for the "Prefecture City Talents List," which is a derivative list of the List of Heroes. Although such lists have some prestige.

But the Heaven and Earth Four Lists... only include the List of Heroes, List of Beauties, Red List, and List of Divine Weapons. The so-called "Prefecture City Talents List," in the end, is a list specially set up by the prefecture city to identify rising stars.

The emissaries and elders were all silent. Water Altar Deputy Envoy Yan Hao said, "Chief Emissary, even the Human List of the List of Heroes is not easy to enter. It not only depends on individual strength but also on the backing influence."

"There are only 108 spots. They are still young. It's a bit too much to ask."

Shi Yufei said calmly, "The Water Altar is located in Huaiyin Prefecture. As far as I know, the 106th place on the Human List here... is a fourteen-year-old boy from the Lishan Sword Sect."

The List of Heroes has no age limit. Therefore, being able to挤进 the list at a young age is truly exceptional!

Shi Yufei said, "Huaiyin Prefecture already has quite a few young heroes who can挤进 the Human List of the List of Heroes. We should naturally encourage ourselves... Although what we do is different from them, don't forget, we were once..."

He spoke to this point, a nostalgic look on his face. The expressions of the others were varied. Yan Hao was indifferent, Jin Shichang and Ye Cheng were slightly fanatical, while Meng Han and Liu Yu looked into the distance.

The grand gathering was very lively.

Several more fights were seen. Ding ZeLin and Wolf Blade appeared one after another, performing brilliantly, causing the whole venue to cheer and be extremely lively.

Shi Yufei nodded slightly, but always felt a slight sense of regret. He couldn't see the style he wanted to see.

Suddenly, he saw an arena.

Li Xian stepped forward and cupped his fists.
