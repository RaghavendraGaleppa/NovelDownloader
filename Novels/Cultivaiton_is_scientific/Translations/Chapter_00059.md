# Chapter 59: News  

"I wonder when I'll be able to break through!" Li Shiming murmured to himself as he sensed the spiritual energy vortex within his body.  

Ever since drinking the spirit tea at Gu Jia's place, his spiritual power had surged. Combined with six months of diligent cultivation and the nourishment from spirit food, he had finally reached the peak of the second level of Qi Refinement.  

He could feel a barrier before him—breaking through it would propel him into the third level of Qi Refinement.  

His consciousness entered the machine room space, where he observed the spirit tea tree that had grown six new branches. The leaves were sparse, and he hesitated to pluck them.  

Compared to the Talisman Spirit Bamboo, the spirit tea tree grew much slower.  

After more than half a year, the tree had barely branched out, still far from its mature form. Harvesting the leaves now would undoubtedly harm its growth and delay its development.  

"Better wait a little longer," Li Shiming thought, abandoning the idea of picking the tea leaves. His cultivation speed was already impressive by most standards.  

Of course, his progress was remarkable only when compared to rogue cultivators. In just a year, he had gone from having no foundation at all to standing on the threshold of the third level of Qi Refinement. Most rogue cultivators took nearly a decade to reach this stage.  

Over the past six months, he had accumulated over two thousand catties of spirit rice and a vast stockpile of various low-grade talismans. If not for the scarcity of talisman ink materials, his collection would have been even larger.  

After the Hao family's extermination, some cultivators had attempted to enter the talisman business. However, due to resource limitations, their operations remained small-scale.  

Li Shiming had a high demand for talisman ink, but to avoid drawing attention, he refrained from further transactions with rogue cultivators.  

He was acutely aware of his situation—while no one dared provoke him openly, it wasn't because of his own strength but rather Gu Jia's influence. Since Gu Jia couldn't always be by his side, Li Shiming needed to lay low and bide his time.  

Just as he was thinking of Gu Jia, a *Hundred-Mile Message Talisman* flew toward him. The talisman took the form of a small bird, carrying another talisman in its beak.  

Li Shiming extended his hand, and the bird alighted on his palm, transforming into a letter along with the accompanying talisman.  

"Recently, there have been reports of cultivators controlling corpse puppets to commit murders. Keep this *Hundred-Mile Message Talisman* with you. If you encounter trouble, activate it immediately to call for help."  

Reading the letter, Li Shiming felt a surge of gratitude. Regardless of Gu Jia's underlying motives, this gesture was one he couldn't ignore.  

He had seen *Hundred-Mile Message Talismans* many times before, but without the corresponding spell, he couldn't craft them himself. The one Gu Jia had sent was pre-set to transmit to the small courtyard in the imperial palace, where Gu Jia spent most of his time.

"Corpse puppets?" Li Shiming racked his brain but found no mention of such a technique in his limited knowledge of cultivation.  

Judging by the name alone, it seemed to involve reanimating corpses for one's own use.  

Li Shiming wasn't entirely without sources of information. He maintained contact with the scholars who had passed the imperial examinations alongside him.  

These scholars had entered various government departments, and through their conversations, he often gleaned insider knowledge.  

Fellow examination graduates formed a tightly-knit group, especially since they were still in the early stages of their official careers, with minimal conflicts among them. Tradition held that those who passed the exams in the same year were among the most valuable allies in officialdom, so their connections remained strong.  

Though Li Shiming held no official position, the emperor's favor ensured he was never overlooked. His fellow graduates always included him in gatherings.  

At these gatherings, he had heard about a series of bizarre murders—over a dozen cases where victims had been drained of all their blood.  

Now, connecting this with Gu Jia's warning, Li Shiming suspected these crimes were the work of corpse puppets.  

However, mortal rumors differed from cultivator intelligence. He wondered if he should seek out a fellow cultivator to learn more about recent events.  

His thoughts immediately turned to Clan Leader Liu. Over the past six months, the two had interacted several times, and the clan leader had always treated him well.  

He knew Clan Leader Liu was currently residing in the city—not because the Liu family, like some rogue cultivators, had relocated entirely, but because they had split into two groups. One remained at their ancestral home, while the other moved into the city.  

This was a precaution against suffering the same fate as the Hao family—complete annihilation.  

The Liu family wasn't alone in this strategy; three other cultivation families had done the same.  

Among rogue cultivators, the prevailing belief was that things would stabilize after the Ascension Assembly. The influx of cultivators to the capital was largely due to the assembly, presenting an opportunity to earn extra spirit stones in the city's market.  

When Li Shiming paid Clan Leader Liu a visit, the latter personally greeted him at the door.  

"Brother Li, what brings you here today?" Clan Leader Liu asked with a strained smile after ushering him into the reception hall and seating him as a guest of honor.  

"I heard from Elder Brother Gu that a cultivator is using corpse puppets to wreak havoc. I came to inquire for more details," Li Shiming replied bluntly, getting straight to the point.  

"I do know about this. Just yesterday, a third-level Qi Refinement cultivator, Brother Gu, was killed by a corpse puppet less than a mile from here. Elder Brother Gu has already reported it to the sect, and rogue cultivators have been tasked with tracking down the culprit," Clan Leader Liu explained, his face etched with concern.  

---  

Now Li Shiming understood why Gu Jia had warned him. A murder in the capital, especially one involving a cultivator, was no small matter.  

Under normal circumstances, Gu Jia wouldn't have intervened in a cultivator's death. But these rogue cultivators had sought his protection, and their deaths demanded action—otherwise, the Heavenly Sea Sect would struggle to maintain authority over them in the future.  

"Is this cultivator really so strong that Elder Brother Gu has to report it to the sect?" Li Shiming asked, surprised.  

Gu Jia was the most powerful cultivator in the area. If even he felt the need to escalate the matter, the situation must be dire.  

"We don't know exactly how strong he is, but he's at least at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement—possibly even at the late stage, like Elder Brother Gu," Clan Leader Liu replied with a bitter smile.  

Li Shiming's hair stood on end. A powerful cultivator lurking in the shadows like a hunter was an extreme danger for a novice like him, barely at the second level of Qi Refinement.  

No wonder Gu Jia had sent him the *Hundred-Mile Message Talisman*—the threat was that severe.  

"Cultivators are now sticking together, afraid to act alone. We suspect this culprit may be connected to the one who exterminated the Hao family half a year ago," Clan Leader Liu continued.  

"I hope they find him soon. Otherwise, none of us will sleep soundly at night," Li Shiming said gravely, careful not to reveal too much.  

Having obtained the information he needed, he didn't overstay his welcome. Taking advantage of the remaining daylight, he headed home.  

He had no intention of wandering outside after dark—that would make him easy prey for the hidden cultivator.
