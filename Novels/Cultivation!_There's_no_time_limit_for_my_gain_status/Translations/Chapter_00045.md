# Chapter 45: The Fire Peak Sword Cultivator

Splashing through the water, Jiang Li emerged from the riverbank carrying a half-man-sized boulder, trudging step by step onto dry land.

Ptooey! Ptooey!

Spitting repeatedly, Jiang Li began clearing the mud and sand from his mouth and nose the moment he reached shore. His appearance was utterly disheveled—tattered clothes, unkempt hair covered in mud and water weeds, with several plump river snails still clinging to his forehead. At that moment, he looked no different from a water ghoul.

Just as he was rhythmically spitting out debris, Jiang Li suddenly froze. The muscles in his arms bulged violently as he hurled the boulder he was still holding with all his might toward his side.

Boom!

The half-man-sized rock had barely flown halfway when a streak of light shot toward it, instantly reducing the boulder to a shower of shattered fragments. The projectile's momentum slowed slightly after piercing through the stone, allowing Jiang Li's enhanced vision to barely track its trajectory.

But... he couldn't dodge it!

Wooden Armor Technique! Armed Hardening!

Clang!

Jiang Li's hands, now covered in wooden armor and reinforced with dark energy, clamped down on the streak of light mid-flight. A tremendous force transmitted through his arms, and though his feet remained planted, the impact sent him skidding backward, plowing two ankle-deep furrows in the ground.

The object in his grasp struggled violently, emitting scorching heat as it attempted to pierce through his body and burn his heart to ashes. The wooden armor covering his hands quickly charred and disintegrated under the intense heat.

Sizzle!

The blackened skin of his Armed Hardening made direct contact with the projectile. A searing pain shot through his palms as the faint scent of burning flesh wafted through the air—yet surprisingly, the temperature was still within tolerable limits!

The cooling effect of his hardened skin allowed him to withstand the fiery assault. His dark hands maintained an iron grip on the streaking light as he wrestled against its momentum. Bolstered by [Bloodburst Frenzy], Jiang Li's monstrous strength allowed him to hold his ground, even as he was pushed back nearly twenty meters.

Only when his heels reached the riverbank did he finally halt his forced retreat. As the dazzling light in his hands dimmed, the projectile's true form was revealed—a slender, dark-red sword that continued to vibrate fiercely in his grasp.

"Bloody hell! A flying sword?!"

Jiang Li cursed aloud, only to feel the sword heating up again in his hands.

"Not done yet? Let me help you quench that fire!"

Glancing at the murky river behind him, he flipped backward while clutching the crimson sword and plunged into the water.

---

Bubbles erupted violently as if the water were boiling, with plumes of steam rising in thick white clouds.

"Damn it! My flying sword!"

Moments later, a white-robed figure arrived, gracefully alighting on the treetops. Yet his frantic demeanor upon landing might have made onlookers think his wife was in labor.

The young man appeared only slightly older than Jiang Li, with striking, jade-like features and an air of heroic vigor. Given a few more years, he would undoubtedly become another heartthrob capable of driving countless young women wild. Embroidered on the chest of his white robes was a small crimson sword—the mark of a Fire Peak disciple from Mount Shu's Five Elements Sect.

"Scarlet Sky Sword! Return! Return! Return!..."

"Why isn't it working?"

The Fire Peak disciple gestured urgently with sword fingers toward the still-bubbling water, but his treasured flying sword refused to reappear.

"Did the water damage it? Damnable monster!"

Just as he was scratching his head in desperation—

Splash!

A chain shot out from the water with astonishing speed, coiling around him before he could react. With nine-tenths of his combat prowess reliant on his sword, the disciple—now disarmed and ambushed—was helpless as the chain yanked him toward the river.

Jiang Li, still submerged, felt victory within reach. All he needed was to drag his attacker underwater and deliver a beating the man would never forget.

But then—hubris struck.

Sword Light Technique!

A two-foot-long blade of crimson light erupted from the Fire Peak disciple's right sword fingers. With a single slash, the razor-thin energy cleanly severed the chain's thick links.

Though the chain had some history behind it, it was ultimately just a mundane object. Its inferior materials might have sufficed for ordinary use, but against spells or magical artifacts, destruction was inevitable.

Jiang Li's heart ached—that chain had cost him three spirit stones! Bursting from the water with the Scarlet Sky Sword in hand, he lunged at the disciple, now barely three steps away, shouting:

"Give me back my treasure!"

The Fire Peak disciple paled.

"What?! That thing was a treasure?!"

Before he could process this, Jiang Li was upon him.

Like a tiger pouncing on prey, Jiang Li wielded the sword in one hand while the other formed a claw. His monstrous strength, concentrated in his powerful frame, could tear the physically frail swordsman apart in seconds.

Yet Mount Shu's Five Elements Sect lived up to its reputation as one of the Four Overlords of the Great Heavy Mountains—their disciples were no pushovers.

Instead of retreating, the white-robed swordsman raised his sword fingers and charged forward.

The two collided. The older Fire Peak disciple was effortlessly overpowered, his throat seized as Jiang Li slammed him to the ground.

But Jiang Li's assault came to an abrupt halt.

The Scarlet Sky Sword, which had been gripped in his left hand with its blade pointing forward, had somehow rotated 180 degrees. Its razor-sharp edge now pressed against Jiang Li's own throat, radiating faint heat.

Silence fell.

Face-to-face—close enough to kiss—the two remained locked in stalemate for nearly ten seconds. Jiang Li repeatedly strained his left hand, attempting to wrest back control of the flying sword through brute force, but eventually conceded that one-handed strength alone couldn't overpower the weapon.

Finally, Jiang Li broke the tension with a bright smile.

"Senior Brother, perhaps there's been some misunderstanding."

"Your junior brother is Jiang Li of the Hidden Scripture Valley. I merely fell into the river and had just climbed ashore when you sent your flying sword at me."

Though Jiang Li addressed him warmly as "Senior Brother," his grip on the man's throat didn't loosen in the slightest.

His words, however, seemed to trigger realization in the other—he really had attacked the wrong person.

While the Four Overlords couldn't be called inseparable allies, they generally stood on the same side. Minor conflicts between them rarely escalated to lethal violence.
