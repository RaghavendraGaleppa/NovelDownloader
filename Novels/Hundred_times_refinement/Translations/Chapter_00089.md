# Chapter 39: The Lingyun Formula  

Early the next morning, the mountaintop was bustling with activity. For the Lingyun Sect, today marked the unfortunate day of their disbandment and asset liquidation. However, for the other cultivators who stood aloof from the matter, this was a day they had long anticipated.  

Major sects and immortal cultivation families aside, even rogue cultivators were eager to scour for decent treasures among the offerings. Lin Xuan rose early, but by the time he arrived at the square, it was already packed with cultivators.  

At the entrance, each person received a jade slip. By channeling their spiritual sense into it, they could view the detailed schedule for the day's events.  

The treasure exchange was divided into two parts: an auction and a free selection. The auction, where participants would bid, naturally featured higher-grade items, including spirit artifacts, crafting materials, and beast eggs.  

While spirit artifacts and crafting materials were well-known, the beast eggs were the unhatched offspring of spirit beasts. It was common knowledge that spirit beasts, like cultivators, could absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and wield formidable powers. Though fierce, they could be tamed and, once bonded to a master, would never betray them. Many cultivation sects were accustomed to raising spirit beasts as guardians for their gates and mountains.  

These eggs were laid by the Lingyun Sect's tamed spirit beasts. Since they hadn't hatched yet and thus hadn't bonded with a master, purchasing them was a bargain.  

It was clear that the auction items were the Lingyun Sect's true treasures. However, ordinary rogue cultivators needn't entertain any hopes—these would undoubtedly be divided among sects like the Drifting Cloud Valley, the Fire Spirit Sect, the Talisman Mountain Sect, and the Heavenly Star Sect. At best, cultivation families might scavenge a few low-grade spirit artifacts or inferior beast eggs overlooked by the major sects.  

The second part of the exchange was the free selection. This was somewhat similar to the rogue cultivators' stalls from previous days, except the Lingyun Sect had categorized the items they intended to sell, allowing everyone to browse and choose.  

Though the best treasures had already been reserved for the auction, the Lingyun Sect's thousand-year accumulation was still impressive. Various low-tier items—even those useful for Foundation Establishment cultivators—might appear.  

These, however, held no interest for the major sects. The primary buyers would be cultivation families and wealthier rogue cultivators.  

The jade slip provided a clear introduction, even listing the items for sale in detail. This pleased Lin Xuan, as it saved him much trouble.  

Skipping the rest, Lin Xuan went straight to the section on cultivation techniques. There were over a dozen low-tier techniques available, which reignited his interest. Although the Drifting Cloud Valley had imparted a low-tier technique to him, as an overlooked disciple, he had only been given the most ordinary one.  

Truly excellent low-tier techniques were reserved for a select few elite disciples.  

This was why, despite having ample spiritual medicine and diligent cultivation, Lin Xuan had struggled to break through to the fifth layer.  

While the Lingyun Sect couldn't compare to the Drifting Cloud Valley in terms of high-level cultivators or mid-tier techniques, their low-tier techniques were on par.  

So why not purchase an exquisite low-tier technique? It would make his cultivation smoother and faster.  

What particularly excited Lin Xuan was that, due to limited space in the square and the overwhelming number of participants, the stalls had become cramped. To fetch better prices, the Lingyun Sect decided to hold the free selection in two sessions: cheaper items in the morning and pricier ones in the afternoon.  

Low-tier techniques were part of the morning session, while mid-tier techniques would be sold in the afternoon. This way, Lin Xuan wouldn't have to worry about missing out and could take his time choosing.  

After understanding the details in the jade slip, Lin Xuan headed straight for the low-tier techniques section. If he was going to buy, he needed to act swiftly. He didn’t want someone else snatching the best technique before him—he had no interest in ordinary ones.  

He quickly found the stall, tucked away in a remote corner. The reason was simple: low-tier techniques were only suitable for Qi Condensation disciples. Major sects and even cultivation families largely disregarded them, and while rogue cultivators might be interested, most were too poor. Even if they barely had enough pills to spare, they wouldn’t spend them here.  

Thus, these items were hard to sell. The stall was manned by an ordinary low-tier disciple, with only a handful of visitors.  

Lin Xuan examined the dozen or so jade slips on display, each labeled with the technique’s name. A young man in his twenties sat behind them.  

*"Huntian Art," "Purple Sun Force," "Gentle Wood Technique"...*  

Lin Xuan scanned them one by one until his eyes landed on three characters: *Lingyun Formula*.  

Coincidentally, back when he attended lectures at the Young Eagle Pavilion, a knowledgeable Foundation Establishment expert had once reviewed the foundational techniques of various sects. He mentioned that among the seven or eight sects in Yanzhou, the Drifting Cloud Valley was undoubtedly the strongest, with the most Foundation Establishment cultivators and even a Core Formation expert like Sect Master Yunhe.  

However, in terms of low-tier disciples, the lower-ranked Lingyun Sect was actually no worse. Their best foundational technique, the *Lingyun Formula*, was on par with the Drifting Cloud Valley’s top low-tier technique, the *Flying Cloud Force*, each excelling in different aspects. Both were excellent for laying a solid foundation.  

At the time, Lin Xuan hadn’t paid much attention, but he remembered the Foundation Establishment cultivator’s high praise for the *Lingyun Formula*. Naturally, he now wanted to acquire it.  

Picking up the jade slip labeled *Lingyun Formula*, Lin Xuan channeled his spiritual sense into it for a quick browse before looking up and casually asking, “How much?”  

“Thirty low-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills,” the disciple replied without even raising his head.  

“Hmm.” Without another word, Lin Xuan took out three jade bottles from his robe and placed them on the stall. After the disciple counted the pills, Lin Xuan turned and left.  

The entire transaction took less than five minutes. Then, as if nothing had happened, he continued strolling through the market. Compared to the rogue cultivators’ stalls, business here was booming—partly because the items were more valuable, and partly because cultivation families were wealthier. Many had prepared ample pills in advance for this event and were now snapping up goods.  

Lin Xuan made no further purchases. After wandering for a while, he returned to the inn. Acquiring the *Lingyun Formula* had been a spur-of-the-moment decision. His main goal was still a mid-tier technique containing the *Spirit Control Art*.  

Now, he would rest and conserve his energy. As long as nothing unexpected happened in the afternoon, this trip would be a complete success.
