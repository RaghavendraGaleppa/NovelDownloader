# Chapter 420: The First Mahjong Championship of Autumn Water Pavilion, What the Hell!

Winter's tail had yet to retreat, and the morning sun shone brightly, making the snowy scenery of the Qingyuan mountain range gleam.

In the second-floor boudoir, a breathtakingly beautiful girl, as if the finishing touch to a snowy masterpiece, leaned against the railing with a cold expression, gazing into the distance as if admiring the snow.

But if one looked closely, they would notice a hint of daze in her cool, deep eyes.

She had just opened the window when she heard Li Mo slam the table and say those two sentences.

'He... has never been in love...'

'He... doesn't understand love...'

Ying Bing's thoughts drifted back to her past life.

It seemed that ever since her family died, she had severed all worldly emotions and desires. Seeing others troubled by love, she only felt they were worrying themselves over nothing.

Heaven and earth are merciless, and the Great Dao is without emotion.

She had always believed this, and later, when she reached the peak of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, it proved her right.

Thus, as the Master of the桂宮 (Gui Palace), she decreed that all disciples of the palace must be pure in mind and free of distractions, dedicating all their energy to pursuing the Great Dao.

Although the rules were strict, disciples still repeatedly violated the taboos.

The word 'love', once touched, seemed to make one foolish...

This only strengthened her conviction.

Love makes people foolish.

And so, from then on, her world contained only herself, lonely and cold. At times, she would also watch the snow alone.明明雪根本不及她呼出的一口氣，卻偶爾也覺得有點.....冷？

Until her rebirth.

A long-forgotten, sunny smile inexplicably barged into her life, allowing brilliant spring light to fall upon the snowy mountain.

And, to make matters worse, there was a system.

And, to make matters worse, she inexplicably lost several times...

So, where there is one, there will be a second. Gradually, she got used to being led by him, eating the food he fed her, and calling him 'stinky little brother'.

Occasionally, she would be startled to realize that she seemed to have become different from before.

But this change was something she couldn't bring herself to dislike.

This...

Is this called being in love?

Ying Bing didn't know. The words 'affection' and 'love' were separated from her by a thick layer of ice in her past life, and now they were still like flowers seen through mist, hazy and unclear.

So she changed her clothes, walked down the stairs, and went to the side of Li Mo, who was sitting on the threshold of the courtyard gate, contemplating life, and sat down beside him.

"What are you eating?"

"嗯...油條，來點兒？" (Hmm... fried dough stick, want some?)

So the two of them sat together in front of the threshold, blowing in the chilly wind, drinking soy milk and eating fried dough sticks, watching the sun climb up from the snowy mountains, watching the sky gradually become gorgeous, dotted with white clouds.

Little Li, the love mentor, had the same confusion.

Letting him be a mentor for others, he could be commanding and domineering, giving pointed advice with great eloquence.

But if you asked him to actually practice, he would be just as confused.

"Want more soy milk?"

"Mm."

Li Mo went to get another bowl. Seeing the Ice Cube sitting on the threshold with her legs hugged, he felt it was a bit unreal.

"I want it hotter."

"Is this not hot enough?"

Li Mo thought to himself, why is the Ice Cube so eager to eat something so hot today?

So scalding, what good does it do to warm her up?

He circulated his true energy to heat the soy milk, then scooped up a spoonful.

"Try it again."

"Sss..."

Ying Bing's expressionless, vermilion lips parted slightly as she took a sip of the scalding soy milk with a cool demeanor. Then, she gently exhaled a breath of hot air, and a small, pink, and moist section of her tongue could be seen cooling itself.

"I don't find it that hot."

"Mm, not hot..."

Li Mo, confused, drank the remaining soy milk from the spoon and smacked his lips twice.

Strange.

He hadn't put any sugar in it, so why did he vaguely taste a faint sweetness...

Li Mo scratched his neck. Why had it been feeling so itchy lately?

The Ice Cube silently retracted her gaze from his neck.

"Huh? Aren't we supposed to play mahjong?"

Qin Yuzhi brought out the mahjong table, standing there with a look of being caught off guard, her expression like Uncle达's "I don't have a car yet."

"Why are you two eating?"

"Do you want some too?"

"...I'm not hungry."

Qin Yuzhi had slept for thousands of years, but right now she felt incredibly full. Was it because of her stubbornness?

---

Or was it because she wanted to play mahjong so badly?

Right.

The 'Love Campaign' Li Mo mentioned (a name given by Qin Yuzhi), hadn't it already started...

Thinking of this, she said with vigilance:

"You two aren't playing 'love tiles,' are you?"

"What's a 'love tile'?"

Ying Bing tilted her head. She had never played one.

"Newbie?" Qin Yuzhi narrowed her eyes, revealing a hint of evil.

That requires a tuition fee, you know.

"Looks like we're still one person short?"

Little Li finally remembered that there was still someone in Autumn Water Pavilion, that burly woman who had chugged several bottles of the strong stuff. She should still be in a deep sleep...

So he pushed open the door to the beautiful master's room and saw an indistinct figure lying on the bed in a completely unseemly posture, snoring with arms and legs flailing.

"Master!"

He lifted the blanket.

"Huh?"

Shang Wu opened her eyes groggily, her laziness tinged with a hint of killing intent.

You'd better have a good reason for disturbing me, or you might get into some trouble.

"One player short for mahjong."

"You've got some nerve, actually daring to ask me to play mahjong. I am the number one Mahjong God of the Qingyuan Sect, the one who almost plucked the Green Luan's feathers to use as the One Tile!" Shang Wu instantly became spirited, her steps full of energy. It had been so long since she last played cards.

She had once suggested to the Sect Leader that the Qingyuan Sect hold a mahjong tournament every year.

Unfortunately, it was unanimously rejected.

And so.

The First Mahjong Championship of Autumn Water Pavilion officially began!

While they were peacefully playing mahjong on one side, on the mountain path leading to the main peak's great hall on the other side, Elder Zeng of Hengyun Sword City and the Three Heroes of Hengyun wore faces full of grief, still carrying the breath of last night's alcohol.

Every few steps up the mountain, they would let out a heavy sigh.

Amidst the sighs, they arrived at the main peak's great hall.

"Old Zeng? What's this..."

Elder Han He happened to be heading to the main peak's great hall as well. He and Elder Zeng were old acquaintances. Many years ago, the two had even collaborated to forge weapons, and they occasionally exchanged forging techniques.

It was just that Elder Zeng had better bone structure and higher cultivation, so he had already become a master forger.

"Ah! I'm not here to see you this time."

Elder Zeng let out another heavy sigh.

"Then what is it?"

"It's about Li Mo. Let's talk after I see Sect Leader Shangguan!"

Li Mo?

Elder Han He was taken aback. He had just passed by Autumn Water Pavilion and seen the kid playing mahjong.

Seriously, he didn't even say a word after returning from the Broken Axe Mountain...

The two entered the hall.

Upon seeing Shangguan Wencang, Elder Zeng's first words were:

"Sect Leader Shangguan, my condolences."

"???"

Shangguan Wencang, puffing on his pipe tobacco, was completely bewildered.

"Your sect's Li Mo, at the Cloud Dream Underground Palace, perished. I saw it with my own eyes."

"How is that possible???"

Elder Han He leaned back slightly.

Wasn't that kid just fine, playing mahjong over there?

But the two of them immediately took it seriously, after all, Elder Zeng was at the Outer Scene realm and had excellent eyesight.

"It's absolutely true. I even brought back his remains."

Elder Zeng pulled out that single strand of hair and sorrowfully recounted the events of the past, his story vivid and detailed.

Elder Han He's head buzzed.

Then who was the one playing mahjong in Autumn Water Pavilion?

He suddenly shivered.

From Elder Zeng's tone, he could tell that the Cloud Dream Underground Palace was a strange and诡异 place. Could it be that he had just...

Seen a ghost?!
