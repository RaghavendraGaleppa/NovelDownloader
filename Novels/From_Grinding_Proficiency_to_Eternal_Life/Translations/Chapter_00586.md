Chapter 586: I Want You to Aid in My Cultivation

The information stream on the attribute panel flowed like mercury, with cultivation progress notifications popping up every quarter of an hour or so, faithfully reporting the fruits of this frenzied training.

With the attribute panel, he could clearly see his own cultivation progress.

How could Xu Yunfan easily break away from his cultivation?

It was truly like leveling up by defeating monsters. Watching his proficiency points rise bit by bit, his heart felt as refreshing as if he had just eaten ice cream.

Simply satisfying.

Xu Yunfan's mind was crystal clear, all his focus concentrated on guiding the vast root qi surging into him, sorting out the gradually stabilizing elements of earth, water, fire, and wind within his Small World, constraining the trajectories of the Thunder Dragon and Star Shine, and ramming the embryonic world manifested by his Dao Foundation into something incredibly solid.

As for the earth-shattering roars from the outside world, the supreme pressure leaking from the collision of True君 realms, the thunderous roars emitted by the dying world's will fighting back...

All external clamor was blocked out by an invisible barrier of cultivation.

Xu Yunfan had no external thoughts.

At this moment, he was merely a seeker of the Dao, seizing the last thread of opportunity from the Heavenly Dao to charge towards a higher realm in the corner of a realm destined to be devoured by the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

It was unknown whether three years or five had passed.

Until one moment, when the last torrent of thick, pure, earth-yellow root qi, carrying a few strands of tough gold and silver threads, merged into the embryonic Small World above his head, the entire miniature world suddenly fell silent.

*Boom!*

A thunderclap from the depths of his soul resounded through his four limbs and eight meridians.

The spiritual power within his Dantian instantly boiled and churned. The Thunder Pool manifested by his Dao Foundation, surging with purple-gold thunder slurry, roared as it rushed through his four limbs and eight meridians. Beneath every inch of his skin flowed lightning as bright as molten gold refining iron. Deep within his bones, the clear, resonant chime of divine jade colliding rang out. The phantom Thunder Pool within his viscera suddenly solidified, as if it had truly opened up an inner world that nurtured thunder.

His blood flowed like mercury, faintly revealing a glimmer of starlight flames.

A sense of unprecedented perfection, a saturation of power pushed to its limits, instantly swept through every wisp of Xu Yunfan's divine sense and every inch of his flesh and blood.

The embryonic Small World suspended above his head, which had already expanded to over three zhang in size, trembled violently. The chaotic turbulence at its edges completely solidified, transforming into clear boundaries. The dense purple qi condensed and sank, becoming a thick, earth-like foundation. The thunder inside was no longer wild and uncontrolled; instead, like docile swimming dragons, it traversed between the stars according to some profound trajectory. Stable order had replaced the chaos of its birth.

A breath of creation and destruction, born from opening up an inner universe, spread out steadily and mightily, causing the surrounding space to resonate subtly.

*The Profound Nine Firmaments Primordial Chaos Indestructible Scripture* was complete!

*'Your Profound Nine Firmaments Primordial Chaos Indestructible Scripture has reached Perfection.'*

Along with this notification from the attribute panel, Xu Yunfan's body trembled. Mysteries spontaneously arose within him, and infinite wonders appeared out of thin air in his mind, allowing him to fully comprehend the *Profound Nine Firmaments Primordial Chaos Indestructible Scripture*.

Within his Sea of Consciousness, the shadow representing the embryonic Small World suddenly shone brilliantly. It was no longer projected above the Baihui acupoint; instead, like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, it instantly sank down and took root firmly at the very core of his Sea of Consciousness, merging with his soul.

A vast, mighty power surged ceaselessly from the inside out.

Foundation Establishment, Late Stage, was achieved as naturally as water flowing downhill.

"It's done..."

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes. Deep within his pupils, purple-gold thunder patterns flashed and vanished, as if containing two primordial thunders capable of splitting chaos.

He looked inward at himself, feeling the unprecedented, mighty power surging within him. The embryonic Small World resided in the Purple Mansion of his Sea of Consciousness, providing spiritual power reserves and origin support far exceeding those of his peers.

As long as he didn't overuse his spiritual power and damage the foundation of this embryonic Small World, he could naturally achieve self-replenishment, with a source that was endless.

The cultivation level of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World was far superior to the cultivation in the xianxia novels from his previous life.

A Foundation Establishment True Person, once their Dao Foundation is revealed, displays power that is even more formidable than that of some True Immortals.

Sensing the cultivation memories conveyed by the attribute panel in his mind, a genuine joy welled up in his heart.

The barrier of the Foundation Establishment Late Stage, under the constant washing of the realm's root qi and the support of the attribute panel, had finally been completely broken through by him.

In his memories, it took him five lifetimes of reincarnation to finally comprehend it. It was only by lifting the Small World and placing it in the Purple Mansion that he achieved success.

Now, his Dao Foundation has turned into fertile soil, from which the Golden Lotus of Fate has sprouted. Now that the Small World has risen, it has finally bloomed and borne fruit.

The biggest obstacle had been overcome.

The path ahead was now clear and distinct.

Stabilize his realm, comprehend the strand of先天 indestructible golden nature provided by the Heavenly Empress, until he领悟 and凝聚 his own indestructible golden nature, thereby knocking open the door to Foundation Establishment Perfection.

Naturally, this was no difficult task for Xu Yunfan.

Although the *Profound Nine Firmaments Primordial Chaos Indestructible Scripture* was already complete, there was still a "Dao Deeds" column on the attribute panel, and its improvement had not yet reached its limit.

With that strand of innate golden nature originating from the Taiyin Dao Fruit in hand, this was not an unattainable goal for him.

As for forming the Golden Core and attaining the Dao.

The *Profound Jade Clear Nine Firmaments Primordial Chaos Myriad Transformations Indestructible Dao Fruit* ranked among the top ten of the 108 Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Dao Fruits. It was the sovereign of Thunder Methods, one of the strongest Dao paths of the Yuqing lineage of the Primordial Origin Sect, and had long been inscribed deep within his Dao Foundation. That was his ultimate goal.

The Taiyin Profound Mirror Dao Fruit was, after all, an external Dao Fruit. Compared to the 108 Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Dao Fruit system of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, it was still inferior.

If he were truly greedy for the present and attained this external Dao Fruit, he would likely become the target of public condemnation in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World in the future.

Those Golden Core True Lords would not be polite to a True Lord with an external Dao Fruit.

If it were only for the Golden Core, it would be fine, but if he wanted to go further, the higher the rank of the Dao Fruit, the more advantageous it naturally would be.

His cultivation had temporarily come to a halt for now. Having just entered the Foundation Establishment Late Stage, it was not yet the time to comprehend the indestructible golden nature.

Xu Yunfan's mind moved slightly. He gently patted his navel, and the Zhoutian Spirit Banner immediately flew out. His gaze fell upon that profound and dark Spirit Banner.

The banner unfurled, and a figure draped in palace robes, with delicate features but an inescapable numbness and a hint of deep-seated reverence, was shaken out. It was the Heavenly Empress.

The moment she appeared, she habitually lowered her head slightly, kneeling on one knee, her posture extremely respectful, not daring to overstep in the slightest.

Even though her soul had been completely twisted and confined by the Star Banner, the noble outline and lingering grace of the Mother of the Heavenly Court remained. However, under absolute control, they appeared exceptionally tame and fragile.

Sometimes, it's always about who has the bigger fist, not who is more noble.

"Your Lordship's cultivation has advanced. It is the moment for balancing yin and yang. Heavenly Empress Star Lord, come aid Your Lordship."

Xu Yunfan's voice was calm, but his pleasant mood was obvious.

With these words, the puppet show began.

Before the words had fully faded, the *True Scripture of Heaven and Earth's Exchange of Yin and Yang and Separation and Union* was already activated.

In an instant, profound and complex Dao patterns spread out from his body, instantly enveloping the Heavenly Empress.

The Heavenly Empress's delicate body trembled slightly, an indescribable anticipation rising naturally within her. Having experienced the methods of the Hundred Desires Peak, one truly gets a taste for it and wants more.
