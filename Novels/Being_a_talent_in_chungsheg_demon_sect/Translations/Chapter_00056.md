# Chapter 56: Without Foundation Establishment, Forever a Pawn

For Lu Yang, this was an unprecedented experience. He was "ascending." In some profound and mysterious realm, his position was continuously climbing towards a "higher place," and everything mundane became increasingly insignificant to him.

'Is this the vision of a Foundation Establishment expert?'
'Is this ascension!?'

Lu Yang understood. No wonder Foundation Establishment experts were mostly elusive, transcending the mundane world. Perhaps this "height" was one of the reasons. At the same time, he recalled Yun Miaozhen's "Taiyi Golden Splendor" (太乙金华) great divine ability, which she had unleashed during their previous fight. That divine ability had given him a similar feeling to what he was experiencing now, but not as "high." Thinking about it now, perhaps great divine abilities were a simulation of Foundation Establishment.

No wonder it was said that cultivating a great divine ability could increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment. It was like the difference between "starting to climb a mountain from the foot" and "starting from halfway up the mountain." Different starting lines naturally meant different difficulties in reaching the summit.

The next second, Lu Yang's mind suddenly reeled. Immediately after, he felt as if he had fallen into a realm where he couldn't see his own hand, a place that seemed to encompass everything yet was empty and void, making it difficult for his spiritual sense to expand.

Soon, however, the situation changed.

"Beasts! You beasts!"

Along with a furious roar, a burst of colorful light suddenly erupted in the mysterious realm, and around the colorful light, pillars of towering black qi sealed off all directions. Both the colorful light and the black qi felt as heavy as mountains to Lu Yang. However, from the looks of it, the colorful light was clearly firmly pinned in place by the black qi, and as time passed, large areas of the colorful light were being eroded by the black qi, and the once powerful roar grew increasingly faint.

'This is... a Foundation Establishment battle?' Lu Yang's heart was filled with shock and uncertainty. He understood that he was merely hitching a ride on Daoist Yingshan's perception and couldn't truly witness this grand battle between experts.

However, relying on his experiences from previous lives, he still made a judgment.

'That colorful light is likely an expert from the Shenwu Sect... I get it! This is another trap! But this time, the bait is the entire Skull Mountain!'

Realizing this, Lu Yang suddenly felt clarity. Everything before him solved a puzzle that had always stumped him. Clearly, Daoist Yingshan's fishing at Skull Mountain was for the Witches and Ghosts Secret Realm, and from his words, it was likely related to his cultivation.

Yet, from beginning to end, Skull Mountain only had Daoist Yingshan, a single Foundation Establishment expert. Where were the Shenwu Sect's Foundation Establishment experts? Initially, Lu Yang thought Daoist Yingshan's methods were so brilliant that he could lay out a trap without the Shenwu Sect's experts knowing, but now it seemed that wasn't the case.

In fact, it was the opposite.

'This Daoist probably wasn't trying to hide anything at all. Instead, he was openly manipulating karma, all to lure out the Shenwu Sect's Foundation Establishment experts!'

Daoist Yingshan was at Skull Mountain, using himself as bait. And the Demonic Sect was using Daoist Yingshan to fish in the entire Northern Frontier! Now, the fish had taken the bait; all of Shenwu Sect's Foundation Establishment experts had fallen into the trap!

*Boom!* In an instant, the entire world trembled. A Foundation Establishment expert from the Shenwu Sect roared, "Demonic Sect, do you really intend to destroy our Shenwu Sect's lineage this time?"

"What else?" A Foundation Establishment expert from the Demonic Sect sneered, "Let me guess, are you still hoping for those lunatics from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion? Let me tell you, they won't come!"

"As early as ten years ago, during the Battle of the Myriad Corpse Pit in Jiangnan, our Venerable Elder reached an agreement with the Sword Pavilion's Sect Master. The Northern Frontier would belong to our sect, and the Southern Frontier would go to the Sword Pavilion. So today, if our Demonic Sect destroys your Shenwu Sect, in the future, the Sword Pavilion will destroy the Myriad Poison Sect of Miao疆. It's a one-for-one exchange; neither side loses."

"What... Impossible! Chongguang, you're lying to me!" Facing the enraged accusation from the Shenwu Sect's Foundation Establishment expert, Daoist Chongguang sneered, "Let's just say I'm lying to you. Anyway, after today, there will be no more Shenwu Sect!"

"You fiend!" In an instant, the colorful light surged, finally transforming into five resplendent streaks of Qi. Instead of combining for an attack, they scattered and fled rapidly in all directions.

"Disperse, escape! Try to get back to the sect..."

"Escape? Wishful thinking!" It was still Daoist Chongguang, the Demonic Sect's Foundation Establishment expert, who now seemed particularly domineering. He laughed heartily, "Above the heavens, below the earth, you have nowhere to run!"

*Boom!* With a thunderous sound, Lu Yang completely lost all sensation and fell into a coma. He didn't know how long passed before he slowly regained consciousness, feeling as if he had been dreaming.

"You're awake?" A voice came from beside his ear. Lu Yang's pupils contracted, and he fully awakened. He looked around and realized he was back in the forests of Skull Mountain.

Beside him, Daoist Yingshan stood with his hands behind his back, looking at him with a faint, enigmatic smile. "Greetings, Senior Brother!" Without a word, Lu Yang immediately bowed deeply in formal salutation.

"Rise." Daoist Yingshan raised a hand, chuckling softly, "You have greatly assisted me in acquiring the Witches and Ghosts Secret Realm this time, so your contribution is immense. Thus, I shall give you a few pointers."

"Please enlighten me, Senior Brother," Lu Yang said respectfully.

"Firstly, I forcibly elevated your Qi Fate and helped you seize the Qi Fate of others. Although this allowed you to advance rapidly in a short time, the repercussions are immense." Daoist Yingshan paused deliberately after speaking. Seeing Lu Yang's expression remain unchanged, appearing unperturbed by honor or disgrace, he nodded slightly and continued, "Therefore, according to my calculations, your luck will be extremely poor for the next thirty years. It's best not to cultivate or venture out, otherwise, there's a risk of losing your life."

"I humbly accept your guidance." Lu Yang dared not show the slightest dissatisfaction. After all, though he lost thirty years of luck, Daoist Yingshan gained a Witches and Ghosts Secret Realm.

Without Foundation Establishment, one is forever a pawn... How dare a pawn feel dissatisfaction? For a Foundation Establishment expert to be willing to use you, that is your blessing!

Daoist Yingshan even bothered to give him a warning, which was already giving face to him as a member of the Three Rivers Association, making him somewhat of a subordinate.

Seeing Lu Yang so "sensible," Daoist Yingshan was quite satisfied. He smiled, "Regardless, you helped me accomplish my goal, which counts as a great meritorious deed."

"As the head of the Three Rivers Association, I always reward meritorious deeds."

"Since you've already broken through to the tenth layer of Qi Condensation, the next step is nothing but Foundation Establishment... How about this: I shall bestow upon you a Foundation Establishment Wonder. What do you think?"

At these words, Lu Yang's eyes instantly widened. Foundation Establishment Wonder!?

'That's right... In the life before last, Zhao Xuhe most likely obtained his first Foundation Establishment Wonder this way. It's just that I've replaced him now...'

No wonder he had been stationed in the market for so long, sending people to gather information daily, yet hadn't even seen a shadow of a Foundation Establishment Wonder. Thinking about it now, that must have been a deliberate rumor spread by Zhao Xuhe in his life before last, to deceive outsiders and obscure the truth.

Lu Yang's mind raced, filled with excitement and longing. Yet, in the end, his expression gradually calmed. After closing his eyes and pondering for a moment, he actually shook his head and said, "Senior Brother, may I request a different reward?"

"...Oh?" This time, Daoist Yingshan was genuinely surprised. "Are you sure? This 'Ascension Token' in my hand can increase the chance of Foundation Establishment by at least ten percent."

"I'm sure." Lu Yang nodded. A Foundation Establishment Wonder was indeed precious, but he knew very well that with his Qi Fate damaged for the next thirty years, he wouldn't be able to keep such a wonder! For him now, a Foundation Establishment Wonder would not be a fortuitous encounter but rather a source of disaster, very likely leading to his premature death. This much could be seen from the ending of Zhao Xuhe in the life before last. Thus, Lu Yang, relying on great willpower, forcefully suppressed the greed in his heart.

'For me, there's no need to rush.'
'I've only just reached Qi Condensation Perfection. There's still much room for growth, such as great divine abilities... As for Foundation Establishment Wonders, I can always acquire them in a few more lives.'

Lu Yang's certainty made Daoist Yingshan fall silent. To be honest, he hadn't initially intended to pay much attention to Lu Yang. It was mainly because Lu Yang had broken through two realms consecutively, knew how to assess the situation, and was a member of the Three Rivers Association, that Daoist Yingshan had developed a slight intention to cultivate him.

After a moment, he spoke again, "What kind of reward do you want to exchange for?"

Lu Yang answered without hesitation, "I want a treasure that can enhance my comprehension."

After all, the great divine ability he possessed, the *Grand Yin Metamorphosis Corpse Dissolution True Art*, still lacked the cultivation of the Taiwei Imperial Edict Treasure Talisman, and that part heavily relied on comprehension. If he didn't understand it, he simply didn't understand it. So, without a treasure to enhance his comprehension, Lu Yang estimated that he probably wouldn't be able to master this divine ability even after several more lives.
