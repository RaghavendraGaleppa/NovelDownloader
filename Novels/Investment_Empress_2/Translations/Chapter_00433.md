# Chapter 433: Student Li Is Probably Sick

The Iron Essence longsword, forged through a hundred refinements, was something the two old men had seen many times and was not particularly rare. However, what surprised them about this sword was not its form or material, but its forging technique.

"The texture is incredibly uniform and dense."

"The forging patterns are like stacked mountains, so beautiful, like water waves converging in one direction..."

*Ding—*

Elder Zeng reached out and lightly flicked the blade with his finger, eliciting a clear, resonant hum.

"Good, extremely good! This is absolutely a sharp weapon, and a top-tier one at that."

"To achieve such results on the first attempt at weapon forging... This is something I have only seen once in my life!"

Elder Zeng did not lack famous swords, yet as he looked at this top-tier sharp weapon made of Iron Essence, his eyes were filled with reluctance to part with it.

"Give it here."

Elder Han He took the sword and examined it meticulously, letting out clicks of admiration from time to time.

Hmm, good. This weapon has a soul infused into it.

Every inch is filled with painstaking effort. That小子 (kid) really achieved ten hammer strikes per breath! And he did even better than Elder Han He had imagined.

"It seems you took my words to heart."

"Hmph, if it weren't for my Five Elements Refining Method, how could the Iron Essence have undergone five rounds of tempering and quenching?"

Elder Zeng raised his chin to emphasize his point.

The strengths of the two men's techniques had actually been perfectly integrated within this young man.

The two old men exchanged a glance, seemingly understanding what the other was thinking.

After all, the kid was young. If they gave him a perfect score, he might get arrogant.

Besides, this sword had not yet reached its most perfect state.

At the very least, there was still a gap compared to what the two of them could forge.

"Theoretically, Iron Essence can be forged into a famous artifact, but the sword you forged initially is only a top-tier sharp weapon."

"There are still a few areas where you are lacking."

"I am all ears."

Li Mo put down his hammer and listened earnestly.

This was the life experience of a veteran craftsman, something that could only be accumulated over time. It was not a martial art, and even martial dao insights might not be able to deduce it.

"First, your understanding of 'sword' is still insufficient. The techniques and focus during forging vary for different weapon types; they are not all the same..."

Elder Han He and Elder Zeng took turns commenting one after another.

Finally, Elder Zeng summarized:

"There is one more point. This can't be blamed on you; it lies with the quenching material."

"The quenching oil was used multiple times in a short period by you, causing the oil temperature to be too high. Therefore, the final quenching did not achieve the expected effect. Otherwise, the quality of this Iron Essence sword had the potential to reach a higher level."

"Xiao Mo... Xiao Mo?"

At this moment, Elder Zeng noticed that the little blacksmith Li seemed a bit distracted, so he waved his hand in front of his eyes.

Li Mo's eyes were swirling a bit, and his whole body felt swollen. "It seems the things that can't cool down aren't just the sword."

"Hm?"

"Me too."

"Hah???"

Elder Han He poked Li Mo's shoulder and found that his body was scorching hot like a red-hot烙铁 (branding iron). It was just that the temperature of the fire vein was originally high, so they hadn't noticed it earlier...

"My god, this kid is like a freshly出炉 (出炉) iron billet."

"Is he forging a weapon or forging himself?"

It actually made sense to say he was forging himself.

The Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements was, after all, a process of refining oneself along with it...

"No, this can't go on..."

After a heavy silence for a long time, the Grand Craftsman and the Forging Master reached a consensus with solemn expressions.

They had to 'quench' Student Li.

So...

The two old men lifted the novice blacksmith Li, one in front and one behind.

*Plop—*

He was thrown into the extremely yang part of the fire vein, which was transforming into an extremely yin cold pool.

"Damn, Xiao Mo seems to have sunk!" Elder Zeng leaned back slightly.

If he stayed soaked for too long, not even a hair would be left.

---

Elder Han He panicked: "Quick, fish him out! Aren't you good at catching fish? Hurry up and摸 (touch/grab) him up!"

Elder Zeng blew his beard and glared: "Nonsense, that's called taking a break amidst busyness. The one who is best at catching fish is clearly you!"

"Every time you go fishing and come up empty, you jump into the water to grab one and pretend you caught it. Shameless!"

Clearly, neither of the two old men had any experience with this very new form of quenching.

...

In the evening, the early spring chill was setting in. The withered leaves of the big banyan tree in the courtyard rustled, and the coldness transformed from physical damage to magical damage,钻 (drilling) out from the bones.

At this hour, Qiushui Pavilion was unusually devoid of cooking smoke, making it seem even more cold and desolate.

Because, our Chef Li was probably sick.

He was brought back by Elder Han He, stiff all over. Now he was wrapped in a毛毯 (wool blanket), sitting there shivering with lifeless eyes, his eyebrows frozen.

And the Great Sect Master, Shang Wu, was circling him with suspicion.

"Yesterday he was so full of fire, burning like he was on fire, how did he turn into an icicle today?"

"I don't know either."

Li Mo was also a bit confused.

He only remembered that after using the Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements to temper his physique and forging a sharp longsword, his eyes went black and he passed out.

It should be... passing out from too much fire energy?

But why is he covered in ice now?

Moreover, not only is he covered in frost, but he also feels like there is a fire burning inside him.

If he said he was a hot-blooded youth with an icy exterior and a fiery interior, no one could refute it now...

"Wait a moment."

Shang Wu scratched her head, walked into the room, and came back holding a cup.

The smell of slightly stimulating alcohol could be smelled from it.

"Hold this."

"Huh? Is this some kind of medicinal wine..."

Li Mo was stunned and took it.

"No, wine tastes better when chilled."

"?"

He really couldn't expect the Master to be reliable.

"Let me see."

Sect Master Qin Yuzhi looked very serious, looking like a professional as she placed her hand on his pulse, just like an old Chinese doctor checking the pulse.

Then she frowned slowly.

As everyone knew, Sect Master Qin was knowledgeable. Seeing her frown, Li Mo couldn't help but feel nervous.

"What's wrong with me?"

"Hmm... Your symptoms are actually 'Extreme Yang giving birth to Yin'!" Qin Yuzhi's eyes widened.

"!"

Li Mo shivered, not sure if it was from the cold or the scare.

Didn't you say yesterday that I just had a bit of excess fire, and it was far from enough?

How did it suddenly become Extreme Yang giving birth to Yin today?

"Just kidding, haha, were you scared?"

"So I don't have Extreme Yang giving birth to Yin?"

"I can't tell, because I don't know how to diagnose illness at all."

"...... You're scamming me!"

Li Mo had black lines all over his head.

No wonder no one tried to wake Qin Yuzhi up when she was sleeping in the Yunmeng Underground Palace for so long. It's hard to say that the disciples didn't do it on purpose or 'accidentally'.

If only one of you two was a little bit reliable, it wouldn't be this unreliable!

He felt that staying in Qiushui Pavilion was no different from going to the hospital for a cold in his previous life.

If there was nothing wrong originally, Qin Yuzhi and Shang Wu might cause some trouble for him.

He took a deep breath, supporting his stiff body, preparing to go to the Dan Ding Peak to find Elder Xue for a look. Although he felt he wasn't too serious and wouldn't have any major problems for the time being, he was afraid that over time, something might really go wrong.

But just at this moment, a crisp sound of footsteps came from the stairs of the pavilion.

Li Mo paused and looked back, seeing the cold and otherworldly face of the Immortal Qing.

Ying Bing's first glance fell on Student Li. Sensing that his condition was off, the originally detached and aloof expression suddenly gained a hint of seriousness, and her shapely eyebrows furrowed deeply.

"Li Mo, come over and sit down properly."
