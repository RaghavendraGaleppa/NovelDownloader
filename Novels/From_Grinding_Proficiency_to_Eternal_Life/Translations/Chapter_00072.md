# Chapter 72: The Prefectural City and Seeking a Master

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, agreeing.

As evening fell, the caravan arrived at Feiheji. Xu Yunfan’s ears twitched slightly as he faintly heard three carriages carrying black iron boxes quietly turn into a fork in the road, disappearing into the mist.

Liu Tianyun’s command flag always pointed toward the post station ahead, acting as if that batch of goods had never existed.

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, then slowly closed them again moments later, continuing to cultivate the *Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass Bone Refining Chapter*.

He knew clearly that the caravan had its own secrets. He only needed to arrive safely in Changyi; there was no need to inquire about anything else.

Even at Feiheji, Liu Tianyun had specially brought a few jars of wine to drink with him, clearly testing whether he had noticed anything.

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't look for trouble. After drinking the wine, he lay down and went to sleep. Seeing him sleeping soundly, even hearing faint snores, Liu Tianyun finally felt relieved and quietly left the carriage.

"Brother Liu, they have received it," a subordinate reported in a low voice.

"Hmm, let’s not speak of this matter again. Pretend it never happened," Liu Tianyun instructed faintly.

"Yes."

A few days later, the caravan finally arrived at the prefectural city of Changyi without incident.

Xu Yunfan looked up, feeling a surge of emotion.

The bluish-gray city walls rose ten zhang high, resembling the remains of a giant dragon lying across the earth. Thirteen arrow towers stood majestically at the corners of the fortifications, with deep indentations from wolf-tooth halberds and meteor hammers still visible between the battlements.

The two sections of the city wall in the southwest corner, collapsed and then repaired, were particularly eye-catching. The rammed earth was mixed with new traces of iron filings, which clashed with the surrounding ancient rock walls. It was clear this prefectural city had also endured the flames of war.

The noon sun could not penetrate the century-old Xuan iron wood plaque hanging over the city gate. The four gilded characters, "Zhen Hai Ping Bo" (Suppressing the Sea and Calming the Waves), had already peeled away by half.

Two rows of soldiers wearing black armor and holding long spears stood solemnly on either side of the city gate, their bloodthirsty aura thick, eyes fixed straight ahead like sculptures.

The massive city gate was divided into two passages, each capable of allowing eight carriages to pass side by side.

Merchants and pedestrians pushed and pulled goods into the city for sale, creating a bustling scene.

By the time the soldiers finished inspecting the goods and the caravan entered the city smoothly, an hour had passed.

Passing through the city gate, the prosperous scenery of Changyi City rushed to meet them. Shops lined the streets on both sides, and pedestrians came and went in an endless stream.

It was truly a scene of peace and prosperity, completely different from the tragic scene of frozen bones on the roads in Beiye City.

Xu Yunfan felt an indescribable emotion in his heart.

Liu Tianyun kept his promise and took Xu Yunfan to a rather imposing restaurant, ordering a table of rich wine and dishes.

"Brother, you've had a hard time these past few days. Let's relax properly today," Liu Tianyun said with a smile, raising his cup.

Xu Yunfan also raised his cup in response. The two clinked cups and exchanged toasts, the atmosphere harmonious.

After three rounds of wine and five flavors of dishes, Liu Tianyun asked, "I wonder if Brother Xu has any ideas about which sect to join after arriving in Changyi?"

Xu Yunfan shook his head. "I'm not clear on that yet. Brother Liu has been in Changyi for so long, do you have any recommendations?"

Liu Tianyun chuckled, tapping the table lightly with his fingers, and said slowly, "Then you've asked the right person. Two hundred li to the south, hidden within the Longji Mountain Range, are the Three Mountains and Nine Caves. When it comes to the methods of forging bones and refining tendons, there are a few that are quite exquisite."

He paused and continued, "Although they can't compare to the top sects in Zhongzhou, they are quite famous throughout the entire Yanbei Dao."

"Wushan Xueyue Sect is only one hundred and twenty li from Changyi. They cultivate the Twelve Heavenly Beam Fist. There is a Nine Dragon Waterfall within the sect, which is a thousand feet high. Disciples mostly wash their bodies to cultivate, needing to stand on a pillar under the waterfall for three hours to pass. A martial artist with fully developed bones and tendons possesses a pair of iron fists with the power of an iron chain blocking a river."

"There is also the Cloud霄观 (Cloud霄Observatory), which follows the path of secret methods to forge tendons. This sect does not focus on training strength but emphasizes the natural way of the Dao and a pure body and bones. Those Taoists who walk out are all tall and slender, mostly handsome men and beautiful women. Their method of training tendons is called Cloud霄缠丝劲 (Cloud霄Silk Winding Strength), which can use special vibrations to stimulate the bones, skin, and membranes to generate three times the toughness."

"I remember back then, a discarded disciple of Chixiao, Liu Wujiu, cultivated the Cloud霄Silk Winding Strength to the level of great tendons turning into ropes, almost reaching the Jade Vein realm, relying solely on an incomplete manual. If a swordsman from Zhongzhou hadn't come, he would likely be a Blood Transformation expert by now."

Liu Tianyun chattered on for a long time, finally patting Xu Yunfan's shoulder and saying earnestly, "Those sects all have their noses high in the air. When you go to seek an apprenticeship, remember not to get angry easily; it's not worth it. They prefer to cultivate disciples from a young age. As for someone like you who started halfway and seeks apprenticeship with existing skills, others will naturally be somewhat displeased."

"However, with your age and having already reached the Grand Completion stage, many sects won't reject you. Just go for it."

Xu Yunfan thanked him repeatedly. After bidding farewell to Liu Tianyun, he found a blacksmith shop, customized an iron box, and agreed to pick it up the next day.

随后，他找了间就近的客栈住下，开始琢磨先去哪一家门派拜师。

Subsequently, he found a nearby inn to stay in and began contemplating which sect to visit first for apprenticeship.

筋骨皮的修炼法门他如今都已掌握，且练筋、练皮两门功夫极为上乘。那“飞毛腿”虽然听起来俗气，实则是一门相当了得的练筋武学。

He now possessed the cultivation methods for bones, tendons, and skin, and the two skills for training tendons and skin were exceptionally superior. Although "Flying Hair Leg" sounded vulgar, it was actually a remarkable skill for training tendons.

至于“赤练铜身披风锤”更不用说，铜身功大成让他寻常刀剑难伤，三十六路披风锤在同境界武者中几乎是碾压的存在。

As for "Red Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer," it went without saying. The completion of the Copper Body Skill made him resistant to ordinary blades and swords, and the thirty-six styles of the Cloak Hammer were almost crushing to opponents of the same realm.

《铁桥镇关练骨篇》虽然比之不上这两门，但也相当不俗，只是有些残缺，练到大成后便无后续更进一步圆满的练法。

Although the *Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass Bone Refining Chapter* couldn't compare to these two, it was still quite impressive. However, it was somewhat incomplete, lacking a method for further perfection after reaching the Grand Completion stage.

徐云帆思来想去，决定从练骨这一方向入手。

After thinking it over, Xu Yunfan decided to start from the direction of bone training.

第二天一早，徐云帆花了近千两银子买了匹有一丝异兽血蛟马的快马，取了铁匣，将鎏金锏装入其中密封后，心中微微一松。

Early the next morning, Xu Yunfan spent nearly a thousand taels of silver to buy a fast horse with a trace of the exotic beast Blood Flood Dragon's blood. He retrieved the iron box, sealed the gilded steel mace inside, and felt a slight sense of relief in his heart.

他当即快马出城，朝着最近的一家以练骨出名的门派赶去。

He immediately rode his horse out of the city, heading towards the nearest sect famous for bone training.

苍梧山玄岳门，黑铁玄门轰然闭合的余音里，老教习摩挲着虎口的老茧，站在山门内看着徐云帆冷笑。

At the Xueyue Sect on Cangwu Mountain, amidst the lingering sound of the black iron gate slamming shut, an old instructor stood inside the sect gate, rubbing the calluses on his tiger's mouth, looking at Xu Yunfan with a cold sneer.

“八岁后练过鹰爪擒拿的都算根骨脏了，你如今二十一，想要修炼我派武学，简直是痴人说梦。

"Anyone who has practiced Eagle Claw Capture after the age of eight is considered to have contaminated their bone constitution. Now that you are twenty-one, wanting to cultivate our sect's martial arts is simply a pipe dream."

一练武师又如何？去山下武馆练三年筋肉再来测骨！到时候兴许还有机会入外门弟子。”

"So what if you are a First-Rank Martial Master? Go train your muscles and tendons at a martial arts hall down the mountain for three years before coming back to test your bones! Maybe then you'll have a chance to become an outer disciple."

看着紧闭的山门，以及两侧虎视眈眈的玄岳门弟子，徐云帆一言不发，背负着铁匣和瓮金锤转身离去。

Looking at the closed gate and the Xueyue Sect disciples glaring at him on both sides, Xu Yunfan said nothing. Carrying the iron box and the Urn Gold Hammer on his back, he turned and left.

三百里外，青莲山阴山派，一名浑身火烧火燎、毛发赤红的首座打量着站在面前的徐云帆，目光扫过他身后的瓮金锤和铁匣，轻哼一声。

Three hundred li away, on Qinglian Mountain at the Yinshan Sect, a headmaster with a body scorched by fire and red hair looked Xu Yunfan up and down. His gaze swept over the Urn Gold Hammer and iron box behind him, and he let out a cold snort.

“哪来回哪去吧，你筋骨皮俱成，来我这里也是浪费。”

"Go back where you came from. Your bones, tendons, and skin are already fully formed. Coming here is just a waste."

徐云帆面无表情。

Xu Yunfan's face remained expressionless.

当初千佛寺那赤发壮汉双手的高温极为惹眼，阴山派自然在他的考虑范围内。

Back at the Thousand Buddha Temple, the high temperature of the red-haired man's hands had been extremely conspicuous. The Yinshan Sect was naturally within his considerations.

听到拒绝，他也不气馁，转身迅速下了山门。

Hearing the refusal, he didn't get discouraged either. He turned around and quickly went down the mountain.

金阙峰搬山派掌门捏着徐云帆的身子骨，一边啧啧称奇，一边微微摇头。

The Sect Master of the Mountain Moving Sect on Jinque Peak pinched Xu Yunfan's body structure, clicking his tongue in wonder while shaking his head slightly.

“二十一岁就修筋皮二练大成？倒是个奇才，可惜……”

"Twenty-one years old and already achieved Grand Completion in the second stage of tendon and skin training? Truly a prodigy, a pity..."

他眼角瞥向擂鼓瓮金锤锤颈的煞纹，叹道：“早被蛮劲养歪了骨髓，我这镇山六合劲要童子功重塑一百零八块骨头，你这身杂驳筋骨练了反毁我门根基！不成，不成。”

His eyes glanced sideways at the ominous patterns on the neck of the Urn Gold Hammer. He sighed, "Your bone marrow was long ago distorted by brute force. My Mountain Suppressing Six Harmonies Strength requires a virgin body to reshape one hundred and eight bones. If you cultivate with your mixed and impure bones and tendons, it will only destroy the foundation of my sect! No, it won't work."
