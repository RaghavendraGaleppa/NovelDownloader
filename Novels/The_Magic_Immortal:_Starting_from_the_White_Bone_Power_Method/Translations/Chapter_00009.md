# Chapter 9: Cultivating Both Righteous and Evil Paths  

Wang Chan clenched the golden bone in frustration, instinctively moving to store it in his pouch. But realizing it was still early and he couldn’t sleep, he decided to examine the differences between a graded cultivation technique and an ungraded one.  

He extended his spiritual sense into the bone, carefully studying the details of the technique.  

Half an hour later, Wang Chan withdrew his spiritual sense, pressing his temples with a look of astonishment.  

The *Bone Devouring Strength Art* was far more profound than the *Mystic Turtle Breathing Technique*. Though classified as a low-grade first-tier technique, it uniquely combined both orthodox and unorthodox cultivation methods, rivaling even mid-grade techniques.  

Its brilliance lay in absorbing spiritual energy to cultivate sinister Yin-based mana, which was then infused into the bones for tempering. This process simultaneously purified the mana while strengthening the bones—cultivating the body meant refining the bones themselves.  

The mana, filtered through the bones, returned to the dantian devoid of any sinister qualities, while the bones themselves became saturated with malevolent energy.  

This was the essence of cultivating both righteous and evil paths.  

Since the bones were concealed within the flesh, as long as Wang Chan restrained the sinister energy and masked it with pure mana and flesh, no ordinary cultivator would detect his demonic roots.  

"If I practice this technique, I won’t have to worry about being exposed as a demonic cultivator," Wang Chan muttered, his eyes gleaming. "But merging with demon bones is a life-or-death gamble..."  

Just then, a message appeared before his eyes:  

**[Discovered Demonic Cultivation Technique: Bone Devouring Strength Art (Low-Grade). Requires demon bone fusion for entry. Fusion penalty can be exempted.]**  

The revelation struck like thunder. Wang Chan jolted upright, banging his head against the door in shock. Though dizzy, he ignored the pain, staring intently at the message.  

After a long moment, realization dawned. "The system can record techniques and bypass the dangerous initiation processes—including demon bone fusion!"

By the Hour of the Ox (1–3 AM), under the dim glow of a lamp, Wang Chan gritted his teeth, trying to complete another cycle of breathing exercises. But with a groan, he slumped onto the meditation mat, utterly drained.  

"The *Mystic Turtle Breathing Technique* is just too weak. Each cycle barely retains sixty percent of the spiritual energy. After days of grueling effort, I’ve only managed to refine a single wisp of mana."  

Standing up slowly, he drank a cup of spirit tea to soothe his meridians while making plans.  

Without the aid of *Spirit Nourishing Elixir*, he had only endured an hour and fifteen minutes before his meridians ached and his dantian swelled. It would take a full day to recover, meaning no experience points for today.  

"I can’t afford to miss even a single daily point. At dawn, I’ll head to Black River Market. Expensive pills are out of reach, but I can’t skip the elixir—one spirit coin per dose. I need to make up for lost progress."  

With over a hundred spirit coins saved, he could afford to splurge temporarily to boost his strength.  

After meticulously planning the next day’s tasks, an overwhelming drowsiness hit him. Rubbing his swollen eyes, he collapsed onto his bed—his first real urge to sleep since arriving in this world.  

But less than half an hour later, frantic knocking yanked him from his dreams.  

In his dream, he had just been about to embrace the beauty-marked patrol guard when the noise shattered the illusion.  

Furious, he slapped his storage pouch, summoning three *Withering Needles* to hover around him. His left hand clutched a protective talisman, while his right gripped a sticky spirit coin, ready for battle.  

"Brother Wang! Help!" a rough voice bellowed outside.  

Realizing it was a plea for medical aid, Wang Chan exhaled sharply, stowing the needles in his sleeve. With a glare, he flung the door open.  

If this wasn’t a real emergency, he’d make sure the intruder regretted it.  

The door had barely cracked open when a towering figure barged in—a burly man with a fierce beard and a shaved head, cradling a pale, bloodied woman in his arms.  

Her abdomen was torn open, intestines visible through the shredded robe.  

"Brother Wang, my wife was gutted by a Three-Eyed Crimson Hound in the northern bamboo forest. She’s bleeding out—please save her!"  

"Tie Zhan?!" Wang Chan’s expression darkened.  

This man was a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator with over fifty strands of mana, wielding a mid-grade magic artifact—the *Mystic Heavy Rod*. A renowned beast hunter of Lotus Mountain, his combat prowess was formidable.  

His wife, also a mid-stage Qi Refiner, was no weakling either.  

Yet even together, they had fallen to the Three-Eyed Crimson Hound.  

Wang Chan assessed the situation. Against Tie Zhan, he might hold his own briefly with ambush tactics, but in a direct fight, he’d be crushed in three moves.  

If he encountered that hound, he’d be devoured down to the bones.  

Since when did such a vicious demon beast appear in Lotus Mountain? The patrols had just swept the area days ago.  

Shaking his head, Wang Chan examined the woman again. "I’m not skilled in treating such wounds. Head to Cave 81 on the mountain—Brother Tang’s *Azure Origin Healing Touch* can save her."  

Tie Zhan hesitated. "But Tang... he’s got a reputation. They say he... takes liberties with other men’s wives..."  

Wang Chan rolled his eyes. "Her intestines are spilling out. Even if he’s a lecher, he won’t try anything with you watching. Go!"  

"Thank you!" Tie Zhan bolted up the mountain, leaves swirling in his wake.  

Watching him disappear, Wang Chan realized his sleepiness had vanished, replaced by thoughts of the Three-Eyed Crimson Hound lurking in the bamboo forest.

At dawn, Wang Chan cooked a pot of white jade spirit rice porridge, savoring its sweetness. But without pickles or cured meat, it felt lacking.  

As golden sunlight bathed his freshly swept courtyard, he leaned on his broom, admiring the tidy space. The aroma of rice and burning spirit wood soothed his restless mind.  

After devouring most of the porridge, he prepared to leave for Black River Market—until a commotion erupted next door.  

"Brother Chen, if you don’t settle this matter today, the Red Leaf Gang will—"  

"Get out!"  

A woman’s sharp retort was followed by a chilling gust. A blade of cold light severed half an ancient pine at the cliff’s edge, sending it tumbling down the mountain.  

Before Wang Chan could react, a severed arm, dripping blood, landed in his courtyard with a wet splat.  

Cracks spiderwebbed across the limb before it exploded, scattering gore across the pristine garden—flowers, walls, even leaves now splattered red.  

"My garden!" Wang Chan roared inwardly. "Can’t you people ever stop?!"  

Freshly cleaned and now ruined. Furious, he stormed out to confront the culprits.
