# 41，守灵

In a basin, hastily gathered paper money burned, casting light in the otherwise cold night. The main hall was filled, silent in meditation, though some arrived with urgency. Spotting the Sect Leader and various Branch Leaders, they would quickly bow, then kneel before Mo Daifu's lifeless body, offer a kowtow, and depart.

No one spoke.

Li Zhiming held his master's cold, stiff hand, soon falling asleep beside him. Seeing this, Gao Changdong subtly gestured, and a nimble martial artist immediately understood, gently carrying Li Zhiming away to sleep elsewhere.

Whispers rippled through the night.

Han Li, eyes swollen and red, huddled beside his companion, hugging his knees, yet sleep evaded him. Memories of his selection into the Seven Mysteries Sect flashed before him, the hopes of his parents in the small village, the expectations for their simpleton son. How much could a poor village boy hope for in life?

He wasn't like Li Zhiming, fantasizing about immortals from the start. He only wanted to work hard, to use every ounce of his strength to live a worthwhile life!

But he couldn't see his own "fate," unaware that his self-pity was the very thing his companion envied. To emerge from this small mountain village and fulfill one's destiny, not just in this vast land, among all living beings.

But throughout all eternity, would there be another?

Who could truly foresee their own future?

As midnight arrived, silence settled. Those who were to sleep did so, scattered here and there. Li Zhiming's performance that afternoon had successfully paved a different path for himself and his fellow disciple within the Seven Mysteries Sect.

With Mo Daifu's death, the Seven Mysteries Sect should be at a loss. As for these two disciples, they would simply await their next "teacher," or be expelled. Those unable to learn martial arts would be sent down the mountain to farm.

As they grew older and stronger, they would become tenant farmers of the Seven Mysteries Sect!

But now, with a clear and obvious Li Xiaodaifu, how different the future could be! Otherwise, would martial artists be sleeping in this room tonight, solely to prevent these two children from being frightened by a corpse in the middle of the night?

If they caught a cold from sleeping on the ground, who would care about their lives?

Furthermore, the Sect Leader Meng Weizhi wasn't being paranoid in considering whether they would be scared by sleeping with a dead body. In this strange and mysterious world, anything was possible, and even a midnight "resurrection" wouldn't be a surprise.

The crickets chirped incessantly, contrasting the tranquility of the valley with the stillness of the mortuary. Exhausted, Gao Changdong glanced at the sleeping children and quietly rose.

Immediately, a subordinate followed him outside.

"I won't be here tomorrow. Take good care of Li Xiaodaifu. Don't let the child handle any chores within the sect, understand?"

The young man beside him nodded repeatedly, his expression solemn. "We understand." His tone was even more formal than Gao Changdong's. "Taking care of Li Xiaodaifu is safeguarding our own lives and fortunes."

"Please rest assured, Branch Leader. We understand the importance. Not just for these seven days, but for the years to come, we won't allow even a bug to bite him."

The young man spoke with utmost sincerity. Hearing the heartfelt words, Gao Changdong nodded with emotion. With Mo Daifu gone, everyone was anxious. Now, with his disciple stepping up, they all felt reassured.

But Li Xiaodaifu was still young. These days, a child's survival rate wasn't high. Of the batch of children sent to the Seven Mysteries Sect four years ago, about twenty percent had already died.

And there was the prodigy of the court, the Grand Doctor Gan from decades ago, who was said to have become Prime Minister at the age of twelve, yet died young at fourteen.

Gao Changdong circled his finger towards the valley entrance. "Get busy, build a perimeter around the valley, find a team to rotate shifts, and prevent any villains from entering, especially those scum from the Sea Sand Gang."

Gao Changdong's voice was icy. "The area around this valley must be thoroughly searched. Remove any places where someone could climb the cliffs, so that there's only one path up the mountain. Anyone coming up the mountain for treatment, regardless of who they are, must have their identity checked."

"When Li Xiaodaifu is seeing patients, there must be at least a Branch Leader level person guarding him, to prevent assassins from infiltrating." After considering the situation, Gao Changdong said, "Alright, that's it for now. Turn this into a detailed plan, make sure nothing is overlooked, and report it to me. After I review it, I'll report it to the Sect Leader."

"Yes."

Was all this too serious? Not at all. With Mo Daifu gone, safeguarding this little prodigy until he came of age was their top priority for the next decade.

"I have other matters to attend to." With that, Gao Changdong walked away, his hands behind his back, and soon disappeared into the night.

Li Zhiming didn't sleep long, nor could he sleep well. He only managed about an hour before he woke up, staring with red, swollen eyes. As soon as he opened his eyes, he met not only his companion Han Li's gaze, but also the concerned faces of the adults.

A young martial artist, a rough-looking man with stubble like needles on his chin, wrung his hands and leaned close. "Li Xiaodaifu, there's still an hour before dawn. You can sleep a little longer."

"We'll wake you when it's dawn."

"Yes, yes," echoed a chorus of voices around him.

Looking at the kind face of the martial artist, Li Zhiming sat up and looked outside. It was the darkest part of the night, making it difficult to tell the exact time.

Li Zhiming crawled to the fire basin, knelt down, and threw some yellow paper into the fire.

Immediately, someone eagerly brought a prayer mat, and another brought a thick coat to drape over Li Zhiming.

Watching from behind, Han Li felt that his companion had earned this privilege through his own abilities, and he felt both envy and admiration.

After burning paper in front of his master's fire basin for half an hour, he eventually lowered his head, half asleep and half awake. As dawn approached, the sky gradually shifted from deep black to pale gray, making it clear that daylight was near. The mountain chill grew stronger with each passing moment.

But the coat draped over his body was exceptionally warm, preventing him from feeling any cold.

When dawn fully arrived, Li Zhiming suddenly felt like a sick bird escaping its cage, as the world of dark and light was difficult to distinguish. Only when the sky was bright did an unwelcome thought creep into his head.

His master was truly gone, and had been gone for an entire night!
