Chapter 158: Anyway, I'm Wearing a Bathrobe...

Yin Huaxuan’s powerless body crashed to the ground.

However, Futu’s aura was rising rapidly at this moment. The phantom of the tiger and leopard behind him melted and merged into his body, and scales began to appear on his body. His forehead bulged, as if something was about to break out.

He actually exuded an aura vaguely similar to Yin Huaxuan at his peak.

“As long as I kill one more...”

*Whoosh—*

Once again, that hammer came crashing down, seeming fast yet not fast, seeming slow yet not slow.

Rule Number Five of the King of Fighting.

When someone is showing off, they have no brain. Striking them by surprise at this moment often yields excellent results.

“Heh, you were actually suited for the Divine Weapon Peak back then.”

“Unfortunately, since you entered the Qunyu Peak, you must die.”

Futu revealed a cruel smile.

He was at the Eighth窍 of the Observing God Realm.

Now that the Hundred Beast Blood Refinement was complete, he was about to transform into a Flood Dragon Demon.

Li Mo had just entered the Observing God Realm.

Even if he was stronger than the average Observing God Realm cultivator, how could he possibly be his opponent?

The expansion of his power made Futu’s heart swell with it.

The hammer drew closer.

He threw a punch with unruly arrogance. The Tiger and Leopard Thunderclap Hand had a terrifying momentum, with violent strength.

*Bang—*

The overwhelming force contained within the Starfalling Hammer of the Panshi Realm only exploded at the moment of contact.

In an instant.

That arm exploded, scattering blood and flesh everywhere.

“Something’s wrong!”

“That hammer just now... clearly wasn’t this heavy.”

This was the first thought that rose in Futu’s mind as he flew backward.

Of course it wasn't.

This was the father of the hammer from just now.

However, the two hammers looked exactly the same.

And now that Li Mo had reached the Observing God Realm, although he didn't use the Seven Stabilizing Universe, his hammer technique had reached a state of perfection. Even a normal swing of the hammer wouldn't waste a single bit of his strength.

Only when you get hit by the hammer do you know if it's forty or eighty—Zhou Shuren.

*Bang, bang, bang—*

The sound of stone pillars shattering rang out incessantly.

“Huh? He’s not dead?”

Li Mo frowned.

No wonder the elders had a chance to save Futu’s life from their Master.

Those who cultivate the Hundred Beast Blood Refinement are like cockroaches, possessing extremely tenacious vitality. They can survive a strike from a Divine Weapon.

This shouldn't be something an Observing God Realm cultivator could withstand.

“Starfalling Hammer of the Panshi Realm...”

Seeing the short-handled hammer in Li Mo’s hand, Futu thought of something, and extreme terror filled his pupils.

This Divine Weapon was actually in Li Mo’s hands.

No wonder...

No wonder the Divine Weapon Cave trembled inexplicably that day.

It was clearly because the Starfalling Hammer had recognized a master!

What terrified him even more was that Li Mo could actually use it!

“Leave!”

The thought flashed through Futu’s mind. The clothes on his back tore apart, and a pair of flesh wings suddenly grew out. With a flap, they carried him soaring into the sky.

Before leaving, he blew the bone whistle he had taken from Yin Huaxuan.

The White Horned Eagle recognized the whistle, not the person. Upon receiving the attack command, it struck again like lightning.

Its speed had reached the limit of a Grade 7 Strange Beast, but in Li Mo’s eyes, it was still incredibly slow.

His body moved slightly, letting the eagle’s claws brush past him.

Chixiao was drawn, and the scorching sword light swept upward.

*Rip—*

The true energy generated by the Yin and Yang Dual Pellets was sharp and dazzling, seeming as if it could pierce the heavens.

With just one sword strike, it pierced through the White Horned Eagle’s wing. Blood rained down from the sky as it fell to the ground.

“Useless!”

Futu cursed through gritted teeth. He regretted it immensely.

If he had known, he shouldn't have helped Yin Huaxuan escape in the first place and just killed him directly.

If the Demonic Sect had pursued responsibility then, even if he didn't die, he would have shed a layer of skin. It would have been better than the current situation.

Suddenly.

He heard a sound of empty explosion behind him, making his hair stand on end.

It was Li Mo, who had stepped on the void, using the Wind Shadow Step in mid-air, holding the hammer and coming at him horizontally.

Futu wanted to resist, but at this moment, he felt like a fish thrown onto the shore. The air around him was solid like an iron block.

*Rumble—*

With one hammer strike, Futu’s bones shattered, and he was blasted into the ground.

The ground trembled, creating ripples that spread out, just like in the written version.

“Let’s put the eighty away for now.”

Li Mo stopped channeling the power of the world. Using the Sun Wheel Sword Canon, he unleashed more than ten scorching sword lights consecutively, blasting them into the deep pit.

Rule Number Six of the King of Fighting.

When he’s down, finish him off. Never be soft when delivering the final blow.

---

*Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle—*

More than ten sword lights wreaked havoc.

Li Mo still felt it wasn't enough and prepared to jump into the hole with the Starry Rod.

“He was already dead when your hammer fell.”

Elder Han He’s voice came.

The old man’s face twitched.

The elders had hoped to squeeze some useful information out of this traitor.

“I told you to capture him, not to destroy the body and wipe out the evidence!”

Li Mo sheathed his sword and smiled sheepishly:

“Even a lion uses all its strength to catch a rabbit. How can one hold back in a fight?”

“Next time, please notify me earlier.”

Han He: “.....”

They had originally planned to root out Yin Huaxuan’s accomplices and interrogate them separately.

Now, the only living thing left was the White Horned Eagle. What use is a bird?

It was their fault too.

When they sent the disciples out, they really didn't say to spare the opponent.

But who could have thought that a disciple in the Observing God Realm could kill Yin Huaxuan before they arrived!

And even took out his accomplice along with him.

This kid Li Mo had just entered the Observing God Realm.

If he went to Hengyun Sword City to attend the Yunzhou Martial Arts Summit...

“Elder Han He, it’s getting late.”

Li Mo glanced at the sky.

A clear hint.

*I want to get off work.*

.......

Autumn Water Pavilion.

The moonlight, like a waterfall, condensed into substance. Within the small confines of the Autumn Water Pavilion, a clear and melodious jade sound seemed to echo.

The commotion from Ying Bing opening her窍穴 showed signs of attracting a heavenly phenomenon.

She opened her eyes and looked at Shang Wu.

Shang Wu nodded.

*Whoosh—*

She rose from the hot spring. A phantom of a lotus appeared, suppressing the surrounding space and locking the phenomenon strictly within the courtyard.

“Haa...”

The fluctuation of life and death at the窍穴 in Ying Bing’s brow was no longer suppressed.

A moment later.

The small phoenix bird she had outlined finally took shape and merged into the窍穴 in her brow.

She was still her.

But after opening the窍穴, Ying Bing gained a touch of jade-like charm, and her noble and peerless aura became even more intense.

She felt a bit weak.

She had just consumed most of her spirit, and the internal energy condensed by the two pellets was completely depleted.

“I’m sleepy. You can recover on your own for a while.”

Shang Wu yawned.

“Thank you.”

Ying Bing bowed her head in thanks.

She indeed needed to recover quickly.

Midnight was approaching.

This meant the system was about to rank the results.

Even a countdown appeared before her eyes as a reminder:

【00:12:30】

【00:12:29】

.....

*Step—*

Just then.

A footstep echoed outside the Mist Flower Spring, and the person walked in.

Ying Bing’s dark eyebrows raised slightly. She had just been guessing the order of the rankings this time and hadn't noticed someone entering the Autumn Water Pavilion.

Who?

Her keen spirit instantly captured the newcomer...

Oh, it’s Li Mo.

That makes sense. Shang Wu is still here. Who else would be allowed in besides him.

“Exhausted. I’ll take a bath to relax. Hehe.”

His voice also came over.

Ying Bing’s gaze froze.

Why, of all times, is it exactly now...

What should she do?

However, it was only for a moment, and her expression returned to normal.

So what if we take a bath together? Why care about such small details?

Anyway.

I’m wearing a bathrobe.

“Huh?”

“Little Ice Cube, you’re still here?”
