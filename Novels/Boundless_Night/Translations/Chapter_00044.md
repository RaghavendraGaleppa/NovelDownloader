# Chapter 44: Heart Stirred

The old man was tall and rushed over at an alarming speed, like a black tiger pouncing on its prey. His cold gaze would make ordinary people's legs turn to jelly.

Qin Ming gripped his long-handled dark gold hammer, moving like an agile leopard. He first leaped forward swiftly, then quickly changed direction, choosing not to confront directly. Instead, he swung his long-handled dark gold hammer from the side, aiming for the old man.

The old man frowned. This youth's speed was surprisingly no less than his own. They were about to collide, yet the opponent could instantly change direction, crossing past him from the right and swinging a hammer his way!

Qin Ming felt a strong vibration transmit through the metal handle. The old man had actually struck the side of the dark gold hammer with his bare hands, which was quite terrifying.

His first hammer strike was merely a probe, meant to gauge how extraordinary the Skyglow Force of a third-stage Newborne truly was. The result made his expression even more serious.

The old man rushed past, his body protected by white Skyglow. Footprints on the ground were filled with cracks, making it clear how powerful he was when moving.

He was deeply surprised. If it were any other lower-stage Newborne, their weapon would have long been shaken loose and flown out of their hand under his Skyglow Force.

After they crossed paths, they had effectively swapped positions.

The old man looked down at the Golden Rooster Knight's 'pancake face' beneath his feet. It was gruesome, utterly disfigured. When he looked up, his eyes were incredibly cold.

Qin Ming sighed. He had only been trying to 'tidy up' the Golden Rooster Knight's remains, not wanting his unusual death to be discovered too soon, when this old man barged in.

He had originally planned to secretly observe the third-stage Newbornes and probe them cautiously, but now he was directly facing a tough battle.

The two silently shifted their feet, slowly approaching each other, like two dangerous beasts gathering momentum, ready to pounce at any moment.

"I'm from Crimson Cloud City. Aren't you afraid of retaliation if you kill me?" Qin Ming suddenly spoke.

He was wearing the armor gifted by Cao Long, Mu Qing, and the others, which was indeed very deceptive. Of course, he didn't believe it would deter the opponent.

But it would make the opponent hesitate for a moment, to weigh the consequences. After all, Crimson Cloud City was the center of this region, and its major families were not to be trifled with.

However, such a seasoned figure would ultimately not show mercy.

As Qin Ming finished speaking, he suddenly erupted into an attack.

Indeed, the opponent's footsteps only paused for a fraction of a second, but that was enough for Qin Ming. He seized this opportunity to strike first, his great hammer crashing down.

The two were already very close. With Qin Ming's sudden explosive strike, the old man could only passively meet it head-on; it was slightly too late to dodge.

"Boom!"

A dull thud echoed in the spacious cave, and the ground trembled slightly. The old man wrapped one palm around the great hammer, his other hand also extended.

However, the force of this hammer strike far exceeded the initial probe. Qin Ming went all out, causing white light on the old man's palm to surge, nearly dissipating.

The old man intended to envelop the hammer like wrapping a dumpling and swat it away, but his 'dumpling skin' almost tore.

He rapidly retreated. This youth, who hadn't even cultivated Skyglow, possessed ridiculously great strength, smashing his palm until it was agonizingly painful and numb.

Since Qin Ming had gained the initiative, he naturally showed no hesitation, striking hammer after hammer, completely adopting the posture of 'random hammer strikes to kill the master'.

Each hammer strike erupted with a thunderous roar, fast and fierce, smashing the old man until he almost vomited blood. He moved sideways and retreated like a ghost, but he could never shake Qin Ming off; the opponent fully kept pace with his speed.

Qin Ming was secretly startled. The opponent had already blocked seven of his hammer strikes, all with bare hands. This was truly abnormal.

Purely in terms of strength, even if the opponent was a third-stage Newborne, he was no match for Qin Ming. But with Skyglow protecting and enhancing him, the old man could directly withstand such a heavy dark gold hammer.

Qin Ming was truly moved, yearning for Skyglow to manifest within his own body.

The old man's face flushed red from the oppressive force. His hands alternated striking the great hammer, but he still couldn't quite bear it; both his hands were trembling.

At this moment, how could he care about his dignity? He finally found suitable terrain with no obstructing rocks. He lunged to one side of the ground, tumbling and rolling, shooting out like a swimming snake.

Though disheveled, he finally broke free from his opponent's rhythm.

He looked down at his hands. Even with Skyglow nourishing and protecting his flesh, they were still red and swollen. He felt as though his bones might have been injured.

"Truly abnormal, couldn't even blow him up?" Qin Ming's expression wasn't very pleasant as he quickly closed in.

The old man's gaze was sharp and cold. He really wanted to ask, 'Who's abnormal here?' How could someone who hadn't cultivated Skyglow possess such a level of strength?

He had already drawn the long blade from his back, secretly vowing never to carry a blade there again; in a moment of crisis, he hadn't even had time to draw it. Just now, his two hands had been swinging like windmills, continuously clashing with the dark gold hammer that kept slamming towards his face.

After the old man held his blade, he used Skyglow to clear the blood clots, and the pain was temporarily alleviated.

"Unfortunately, my Skyglow Force hasn't reached mastery; otherwise, why would I need a weapon!" he said. All third-stage Newbornes would manifest Skyglow, but that mysterious Skyglow Force was very difficult to cultivate.

Qin Ming knew that as one's cultivation level continuously increased, cultivating rare and special Skyglow Forces could tear weapons apart like paper.

However, reaching that level during the third-stage Newborne phase was clearly impossible. Even having learned the so-called 'Juling God Force' or 'Rulai Force' wouldn't suffice; it required the support of a corresponding higher realm.

Qin Ming naturally wouldn't give him time to recover his hands. Wielding his long-handled dark gold hammer and gripping his short sword, he hacked, smashed, cut, and hammered, delivering fifty-eight hammer strikes and forty-two sword slashes in one go, giving the old man no time to breathe.

The old man grew furious. When had he ever been so passive in this region, especially being suppressed by a mere youth? Instantly, his entire body glowed intensely with Skyglow, and he fiercely counterattacked.

Soon, he was inwardly alarmed. The youth opposite him had completely changed from his previous frenzied posture. Although the long-handled dark gold hammer was still powerful and fierce, it now showed astonishing changes; it no longer looked like hammer techniques, but rather blade skills.

As Qin Ming swung the great hammer at high speed, his wrist was still violently shaking, as if vibrating a blade. The great hammer hummed as it slammed down, carrying afterimages, and when it struck the blade, it exerted a terrifying tearing force.

The long blade in the old man's hand was nearly twisted and sent flying. His expression became solemn.

Qin Ming changed his tactics again. The great hammer fell like thunderbolts, one after another. The terrifying dark gold luster crisscrossed the underground space; all due to his incredible speed. The horrifying trajectories carved by the great hammer were dense, interwoven, like a burst of continuous lightning.

With a bang, the old man was sent flying, crashing into the stone wall. His right hand trembled slightly. Even with Skyglow protecting him, he found it somewhat unbearable.

His eyes were cold. He leaped from the stone wall and actively launched a fierce assault. This wave of counterattack indeed made Qin Ming feel a bit strained.

The old man was fighting like a madman, holding a long blade in one hand while his other hand once again began to directly clash with Qin Ming's great hammer.

With a clang, sparks flew from Qin Ming's shoulder. His armor was grazed by the old man's left hand, directly sending four or five armor plates flying. This scene made his pupils contract; the power of the Skyglow Force made him extremely wary.

Qin Ming became cautious, maintaining a certain distance from the old man at all times, no longer giving him a chance to close in. The great hammer in his hand was swung into a whirlwind, with dense hammer shadows continuously blasting forward.

The old man was certain that if he didn't have Skyglow augmentation, this kid would have long since blasted him to smithereens. What kind of monster was this? To be so outrageous even before manifesting Skyglow.

A moment later, amidst the heavy hammer shadows, the great hammer in Qin Ming's hand roared like the sun breaking through clouds, unleashing its strongest strike from within the hammer afterimages.

His speed was too fast; the other hammer shadows hadn't even dissipated yet, swirling like electrical sparks. As the main hammer slammed down, this time the long blade in the old man's hand nearly flew out. He mobilized Skyglow to resist, but he himself became utterly exhausted from it.

Qin Ming continuously unleashed nine such heavy hammer strikes. The old man could no longer bear it; the Skyglow on his body dimmed, and he vomited a large mouthful of blood.

Seeing this, Qin Ming swung his hammer in a sweeping motion again. This time, it carried a biting blade intent, like a bolt of lightning tearing through the night sky, causing the entire dark underground cave to send sand and stones flying and winds to rage amidst the booming hammer sounds.

The clash between the great hammer and the long blade was deafening. The old man ultimately couldn't hold onto his blade; his arm spasmed, the long blade fell to the ground, and he coughed up large mouthfuls of blood.

Qin Ming continued swinging his hammer, forcibly shattering the old man's protective Skyglow!

With a 'thud', the old man's right hand instantly became a bloody mess. Without the enhancement of Skyglow Force, he could no longer block a heavy hammer strike; his finger bones were shattered.

The next moment, the old man's mouth was full of blood foam, and he felt an intense pain in his chest. His entire chest cavity had caved in, and he was sent flying seven or eight meters away by a single hammer strike.

"Third-stage Newbornes are really hard to kill!" Qin Ming panted, genuinely feeling a bit tired. Skyglow Force was extremely troublesome.

The old man hadn't fully died yet and was so enraged that he spat out another mouthful of blood. He felt that Qin Ming wasn't speaking like a human; how could someone who hadn't cultivated Skyglow presume to kill a third-stage Newborne?

However, he was also filled with frustration and resentment. He really was defeated by such a person and was about to die.

Qin Ming stepped forward, preparing to deliver a finishing blow with his hammer. He said, "I'll also give you a flat 'pancake face'."

"I... you scum!" the old man coughed blood, cursing with great difficulty. He was truly unwilling to die like this at the hands of a youth.

"People from Golden Rooster Ridge are too crude, always cursing," Qin Ming shook his head. The great hammer in his hand fell, flattening the old man's face and caving in his forehead.

He began to search the old man's body and 'tidy up' his remains.

"If those mutated fierce beasts rush in later, they should be able to take care of these two bodies for me."

Qin Ming moved about various parts of the large underground cave, his brows deeply furrowed. He had found at least three other old men in other passages, likely all third-stage Newbornes.

"This is troublesome!" He didn't want to take risks or be aggressive.

"Hmm?" He saw another familiar face; it was the Golden Rooster Knight who had once reprimanded them and had even whipped an old man, leaving a deep gash on his face with the whip's tip.

"Kid, where did all those villagers go? Come here, I'm asking you a question!"

Qin Ming directly unleashed a 'Great Qin Flying Hammer' strike. With a bang, the area fell completely silent.

He dragged the man's body into the darkness.

The underground cave system had various spiderweb-like passages. A group of abnormals slaughtered their way in through one of the paths, throwing the entire place into chaos.

Qin Ming retreated to a distance, entering an area where Skyglow was interwoven. He temporarily didn't need to hunt people from Golden Rooster Ridge or the Three-Eyed Cult; he began to seriously search for mysterious resources.

He continued to delve deeper, traveling a long distance.

Strands of light mist flowed, preventing the underground world from being utterly dark.

"Could my luck truly be here?" Qin Ming felt a faint fluctuation in a place where the Skyglow was relatively dense.

Not long after, he crushed a fist-sized rock, revealing a shimmering blue luster. It seemed to be another type of jade-iron, about half the size of a walnut.

"It can only be made into one arrowhead," Qin Ming was still very happy. It was good to have a harvest, and moreover, it was incredibly precious.

"Heh, what a double blessing!" Two people emerged from another passage, looking at the jade-iron in Qin Ming's hand with delight.

Qin Ming recognized them at a glance as people from Crimson Cloud City. Without realizing it, he had ventured so far and run into another group.

"Oh, aren't you Qin Ming?" One of the young men showed a surprised expression.

Qin Ming examined him carefully. He had an impression of this young man; he had been observing when Qin Ming fought Nie Rui and Shen Jiayun.

"Oh, so this is the young hunter you mentioned, the one with astonishing spear skills who defeated Nie Rui and Shen Jiayun?" another middle-aged man spoke.

He appeared to be in his thirties, wearing crimson armor, and offered a faint smile. He said, "You're Qin Ming, right? Come over, let's have a chat."

Qin Ming didn't move, standing rooted to his spot.

Previously, his impression of Crimson Cloud City's nobles wasn't bad. From Cao Long, Mu Qing, Wei Zhirou, to Nie Rui, Shen Jiayun, he felt they were all decent.

However, at this moment, he sensed malice from the two nobles ahead. They were likely eyeing the blue jade-iron in his hand.

Clearly, not everyone was benevolent. Or perhaps, some smiles and elegance were only suitable for public display. In uninhabited places, like this underground world, those hypocritical masks could be torn away.

Qin Ming remembered the young noble ahead. After he had defeated the Twin Stars, the young man had even chatted warmly with him for a few words before parting ways.

"Qin Ming, come over. Do us a favor," the young noble spoke. Gone was the smile from that day, his tone quite flat.

"A third-stage Newborne?" Qin Ming ignored him and looked at the middle-aged man in his thirties. When this man lightly clenched his fist, Skyglow appeared.

"Hmm, you should show proper reverence to people like me. In this dark underground world, all those boasts others made about you are useless," the middle-aged man said.

Qin Ming said nothing and walked towards them.

The two had never worried about him escaping. After all, when Qin Ming fought Nie Rui and Shen Jiayun, his strength was close to seven hundred jin, and he was just a youth who had only undergone one stage of Newborne awakening.

Qin Ming wanted to approach them, but the middle-aged man shot him a glance, so he didn't get any closer. He followed them to a very open area.

"That is..." Qin Ming was startled. Ahead, the light mist was incredibly dense, heavily evaporating. Within it was a three-colored flower, dazzling and brilliant, on the verge of blooming.

The middle-aged man smiled. "Little Brother Qin, I see that your body seems unharmed after being corroded by Skyglow. Do us a favor. Once this three-colored flower fully matures, retrieve it for us from within the Skyglow."

"What's its use?" Qin Ming asked.

The middle-aged man replied, "Its use is immense. It can help one cultivate Skyglow Force. After the third Newborne stage, who wouldn't want to cultivate more types of Skyglow Force? But even cultivating one is difficult. This flower is truly remarkable!"

"That truly makes one's heart pound!" Qin Ming exclaimed.
