# Grand Scene

Late at night, in the profound silence, Qin Ming found himself involuntarily stepping into the dark mist. Unease gnawed at his heart; he couldn't comprehend why this was happening.

He traversed through the dense fog, and beyond a short distance, the scenery became indistinct.

Qin Ming noticed that he was in a "humanoid" form and not dim. At the last moment before leaving, he had clutched the tattered cloth and brought it with him. The cloth piece was about the size of two palms put together, roughly square, and about one palm's length. At this moment, Qin Ming was a consciousness form, size irrelevant. He could drape the dim cloth over himself, which meant that when he manifested, he would only be slightly taller than a palm.

It was a peculiar experience, his senses exceptionally sharp. However, Qin Ming's expression was incredibly solemn, devoid of any hint of a smile. For such a situation to inexplicably arise in the dead of night, an ordinary person would have long since panicked. The fog was thick; this place was profoundly deep, silent, even deathly still. He had no idea where he was going.

Soon, Qin Ming's feet touched the ground, which was black soil, resembling the legendary Netherworld.

"Clatter!" He actually heard the crisp sound of chains colliding, and then he saw shackles silently flying towards him.

Qin Ming's heart slightly jolted. Finally, there was movement. What was this situation? Were they going to shackle him immediately? He swiftly dodged. At the same time, deep within the mist, he saw two colossal figures. They were both as tall as small mountains, now opening their terrifying eyes and striding heavily towards him.

Immediately, Qin Ming saw a gigantic ox demon with coarse horns, its entire body covered in black fur. Its four hooves made the ground tremble, its eyes were golden, and a dense nether-mist swirled around its form. Beside it was a horse demon, its hooves as large as millstones, its entire body pure white, with silver pupils. As it flicked its tail, it dispersed large swathes of the night mist.

"You dare to resist when you see your superior?" The ox demon's voice was like a clap of thunder, reverberating through the night mist. Its mountain-like body drew near. Thick chains, connected to shackles, were coiled around its massive horns. As it opened its mouth, black mist billowed forth like a mountain flood. It was this demon that had just tried to shackle Qin Ming.

"Where did these demons come from?" Qin Ming was completely fearless. In the Untamed Lands, how many old demons had he not slain? However, he suddenly realized that he had no physical body, only his consciousness. How could he fight?

"Hm?!" Suddenly, he discovered that he wasn't a pure consciousness form; his Celestial Light power had followed him! In an instant, he realized something. The secret technique Li Qingyue had passed to him, which he practiced daily, produced consciousness essence, most of which would be absorbed by his flesh and blood, leaving only a small accumulation. And the grand-uncle of Meng Xinghai's master had given him a thin booklet, which he also diligently practiced. The divine intellect produced from it would likewise be absorbed by his flesh and blood, leaving only a small amount. Since Celestial Light energy was born within his flesh and blood, it seemed to have intertwined with his consciousness essence and divine intellect, accompanying them into this black mist.

Qin Ming clenched his fist slightly, and golden light erupted, dispelling large amounts of the black mist! Then, in this form, he activated the Silk Scroll Technique. Immediately, golden rays interwoven around his entire body, making him somewhat resemble the figures standing in the black mist behind Lu Zizai and the Six Imperial Grandmasters. However, his current body was very small, far from comparable to those sky-piercing giants.

"What's wrong with you?" The massive ox demon seemed surprised. The chains on its head rattled again, and the attached shackles glowed with five-colored light, falling directly towards Qin Ming. In this situation, how could Qin Ming sit back and wait for death? He waved his arm, feigning a punch, mainly to make the tattered cloth draped over him flutter. He had already tested this cloth when in his physical body, finding it remarkably miraculous. He wondered if it would be effective in this environment.

He activated it slightly, and the cloth emitted a faint glow, instantly shattering the five-colored shackles. The horse demon's millstone-sized hoof stomped forward, but upon being touched by the tattered cloth, it let out a shriek of agony. One of its silver hooves smoked white, as if burned, and it recoiled in fright.

"Heart Lamp Illumination, Pure Yang Light, this..." The ox demon was shocked.

"The shackles do not bind you, which means you bear no sin," the horse demon spoke.

Qin Ming stared at them coldly, saying, "Don't tell me you two are Ox-Head and Horse-Face, and this place is the Netherworld."

The ox demon said, "Though there are some differences, it's close enough. We've had a misunderstanding with you."

"Pure Yang Light can pass freely through the Netherworld. We shackled the wrong person this time; we apologize. You are a great figure, destined for the Celestial Gates, you should go that way," the horse demon said, pointing the way.

Qin Ming swung his fist, sensing that they weren't that strong. This time, he didn't use the mysterious cloth woven from exotic gold draped over him. Instead, he directly unleashed his Celestial Light energy, and to his surprise... it ignited both of them!

"Ah, this isn't Pure Yang Fire, but why is it so similar?"

"You..."

The two mountain-like demons swiftly disintegrated into ashes.

"What is this place?" Qin Ming examined his surroundings carefully. After burning away the nearby black mist, he saw a high platform in the distance and walked towards it. Although it was crafted from five-colored wondrous stones, it wasn't dazzling. On the contrary, it was simple and unadorned, as if it had endured countless ages, settling into an essence of returning to true nature. There were only three symbols on the platform, which Qin Ming didn't recognize. They were an extremely ancient script, bearing the lingering charm of an old era. But after his mind resonated with them, he understood their meaning: Ascension Platform.

Qin Ming felt like he was seeing ghosts. This black mist world had everything, even using names like this so casually? He had originally wanted to retreat, but now the power pulling him had vanished. However, when he looked behind him, there were no familiar sights. He couldn't find his way back; it was an endless expanse of desolate Netherworld.

"Is this also what it's like deep within the boundless black mist behind Lu Zizai and the Six Imperial Grandmasters?" Qin Ming frowned. He was completely in the dark, understanding nothing about this place's situation. He walked towards the Ascension Platform, genuinely refusing to believe in evil. He was just a newcomer; could he really ascend with iridescent clouds and become a quasi-immortal being?

The moment he stepped onto the five-colored platform, auspicious mists surged, and hundreds of thousands of colored lights enveloped him. Then, Qin Ming found himself ascending, carrying a vast amount of light rain, flying higher and higher, as if about to enter another world. He was stunned. He was truly ascending with iridescent clouds. Where was he going?

Accompanied by melodious music, the dense night gradually receded. He stood on white clouds, seeing a magnificent palace complex in the distance. He looked back, and again, there was no way to retreat.

"Since I'm here, I'll face it calmly!" Qin Ming, draped in the cloth woven from exotic gold, walked towards the architectural complex.

Along the way, colorful clouds lingered and immortal mist surged. He then stepped onto a massive arched bridge made of pure white jade, seemingly spanning a heavenly chasm. In the lake-like waters beneath the bridge, mountain-sized golden lotus flowers bloomed, and under the gigantic lotus leaves, flood dragons swam. Passing over the jade bridge, Qin Ming arrived at a place that resembled a celestial palace. Here, jade palaces and grand towers, golden bricks and jade tiles, sacred and majestic buildings stretched as far as the eye could see. Furthermore, he saw many women here, their colorful robes fluttering, seemingly the legendary fairies, soaring through the air.

In the sky, a cry echoed, and golden light illuminated all directions. A Golden Crow shone upon all creation. That scorching sun-like radiance was incredibly sacred, causing Qin Ming, who had lived his entire life in a world of perpetual night, to fall into a daze, gazing repeatedly.

"Esteemed senior, are you here for the banquet?" A purple-robed woman descended from the sky, her beauty remarkable, and she bowed with a smile.

"Am I very old?" Qin Ming asked.

The purple-robed maiden chuckled, "Those who can come to this place must have reached the Pure Yang level in their consciousness essence, fearless of thunder and fire; only then can they ascend to the Nine Heavens. Only esteemed seniors and experts can achieve this."

"Where is this place?" Qin Ming inquired again.

The purple-robed woman replied with a solemn expression, "This is a Divine Kingdom. My master is the True Martial Divine Lord, the Demon Slayer."

Qin Ming nodded and said, "Tell your master to come meet me."

The purple-robed maiden grew indignant, saying, "Senior, you're being unreasonable. Even if your status is noble, you cannot make such an impertinent request. If you wish to attend the banquet, please respect the local master."

Qin Ming burst into laughter, "It must be tiring to put on such an act. What virtue or ability do I, a mere newcomer, possess to warrant such a grand display from you? This only proves that you are truly too weak. In that case, I can rest assured, haha..."

The purple-robed maiden's brows furrowed in a cold glare. Meanwhile, among the jade palaces and grand towers, before the deepest Central Heavenly Palace, a colossal figure slowly emerged, growing taller and taller, like a towering mountain, looking down upon Qin Ming. Other colorful-robed fairies also took to the air, watching him from a distance. And there were some banquet attendees, sitting in their seven-colored chariots, craning their necks to look in his direction.

Qin Ming spoke, "As I said, I'm just a mere newcomer, yet you've created such a grand spectacle, exposing your true nature."

Before the Central Heavenly Palace, the colossal figure was a middle-aged man, wearing an imperial crown with dangling pearls that swayed. He was utterly cold and exceedingly majestic.

Qin Ming said, "Alas, I must thank you for going to such great lengths to show me such a grand scene. Living in a world of perpetual night, these things were merely a luxury, something I could only dream of. But today, you helped me construct a false grand scene. Although I quickly saw through the illusion, those beautiful sights will linger in my memory for a long time."

"You can see through all of this?" The purple-robed maiden was astonished. It truly had been a futile effort, offering a show for nothing.

"Indeed," Qin Ming nodded. When he resonated with the emotions, he sensed a dense resentment and saw through the false scenario constructed by consciousness essence.

"Enough!" he roared, unwilling to waste any more time, genuinely fearing a small oversight leading to major disaster.

"In the past, in my eyes, let alone a newcomer like you, even an External Sage would be no different from an ant on the ground. Alas, how lamentable, how pathetic!" The mountain-like middle-aged man spoke, blue light appearing in his eyes. At the same time, the fairies and the banquet attendees all shattered.

Qin Ming dared not be careless. Even though he knew the opponent was extremely weak and likely couldn't harm him, he still launched an all-out attack. He activated the tattered cloth on his body, mainly to ignite the Remnant Sun Sigil. With a loud boom, a dazzling golden sun appeared outside his body, illuminating the area before him.

In an instant, the jade palaces and grand towers were set ablaze, the palaces collapsed, and the middle-aged man let out a shriek of agony, exclaiming in disbelief, "What is that?! How do you possess such a thing?!" He retreated at extreme speed, but he was very weak and couldn't avoid it at all. Compared to his peak, his current strength was negligible, practically insignificant. Otherwise, with his status, how could he possibly act out a charade with such an "ant"!

Rumble! The sky shattered and the earth cracked. All the architectural complexes collapsed and went up in flames. Fierce blazes spread across the Nine Heavens, and even the entire world began to crumble. There was no Divine Kingdom's grand scene here; the true sight was merely rubble everywhere, broken walls, and scorched earth.

A large blue centipede, very faint, roared in front, but it was helpless. This was the "great existence" that had sought to "subdue" Scarlet Cloud City and the surrounding mountains. Tonight, a wisp of its lingering spirit was stirring up trouble, seeking revenge on Qin Ming and wanting to reclaim its divinity. In the ruins, there was an altar emitting misty light. The centipede's lingering spirit had used some ritual to draw Qin Ming's consciousness to this place. But now, as the great sun appeared on the tattered cloth, the illuminated altar collapsed.

"Damn it, I was supposed to become a god, but I was blocked! My last wisp of spirit can't even deal with a mere newcomer and is about to vanish! Heavens, how unfair are you!" The blue centipede roared. In truth, it had already been killed by the four great experts. This was merely its last wisp of resentment, stirring up trouble in this special black mist world. This place of broken walls and general ruin had once been its divine kingdom, shattered and destroyed by the four great experts.

"You died without injustice. To forge your path to godhood, you tried to devour the entire surrounding region, causing an entire city of people to die unjustly. If you were to become a god, that would be true unfairness to heaven and earth." Although Qin Ming had taken quite a bit of its divinity, he felt no guilt whatsoever.

That last faint blue light exploded, and it completely dissipated.

Qin Ming searched here, realizing that the entire ruin had been cleared out. When the four suns appeared, this place was breached, and how could any valuable items remain? Finally, at the collapsed altar, he discovered a golden scale. It was with this item that the great centipede had activated the dilapidated altar, drawing Qin Ming's consciousness to this realm. Qin Ming was certain that this item hadn't been here before, otherwise it would have been taken by the four great experts long ago. It must have been brought back by the centipede's lingering spirit from somewhere else. He guessed that the great centipede wanted to put him on the altar as a live sacrifice!

"There are words!" Qin Ming discovered tiny, intricate characters on the scale. He was overjoyed, astonished by such a gain. He felt that such a record was absolutely not simple!

At this moment, he felt a pulling force emerge, drawing him away involuntarily. Qin Ming didn't panic, vaguely realizing that he was about to return to his physical body. Moments later, he passed through the dense black mist, appeared in his room, and then with a whoosh, merged back into his body.

In the profound silence of the night, he awoke.

Qin Ming suddenly sat up, a little doubtful. Was everything he had just experienced real? It felt like a dream. When he looked down, he confirmed it wasn't a dream! Because, right there on the bed, was a palm-sized golden scale, shimmering brightly, intricately engraved with countless tiny characters.
