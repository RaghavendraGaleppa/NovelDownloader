# Chapter 4: The Primordial Enlightenment Scripture

Over the years, Chen Daoxuan had invested most of the resources that should have been used for learning artifact forging into developing his envisioned furnace. Unfortunately, things hadn't gone as planned.

With the wisdom of his past life, Chen Daoxuan understood that research might be an endeavor that never yields returns, but success could bring astonishing rewards.

"Fortunately, with the help of the 'Primordial Enlightenment Scripture,' my progress in artifact forging far exceeds what outsiders could imagine!" Chen Daoxuan murmured.

The "Primordial Enlightenment Scripture" he mentioned was discovered five years ago when he broke through to the Qi Refining stage and opened his sea of consciousness. At that time, it lay quietly at the center of his mind—mysterious, serene, and emitting a faint golden light.

The characters in this scripture were unfamiliar to Chen Daoxuan, yet he inexplicably understood their meaning and could recite them from memory. Translated, the scripture was called the "Primordial Enlightenment Scripture."

The scripture wasn't long; reciting it in its entirety took exactly the time it took for an incense stick to burn. At first, Chen Daoxuan didn't notice anything unusual about it. He only felt his spiritual sense replenished, his mind clearer, and a refreshing sensation after reciting it.

However, when he began studying artifact forging and attempted to refine copper ore for the first time, he discovered the scripture's terrifying power. Normally, even a first-rank artifact smith would feel mentally exhausted after refining spirit ore for three days and nights. For Chen Daoxuan, who was only at the first layer of Qi Refining at the time, the toll was even worse.

He remembered collapsing after his first refining session in the Earthfire Chamber, his sea of consciousness feeling as if it had been shattered. Then, as if guided by instinct, he recited the Primordial Enlightenment Scripture. To his surprise, not only did his chaotic sea of consciousness return to normal, but his spiritual sense also seemed to have grown slightly stronger.

From that moment, Chen Daoxuan realized that the scripture's ability to restore a cultivator's spiritual sense alone made it invaluable. Although spirit medicines that restored spiritual sense weren't rare in the cultivation world, each was exorbitantly priced—far beyond what a small clan like the Chen Family of Twin Lakes Island could afford.

This was why, despite his rapid progress in artifact forging thanks to the scripture, he dared not reveal it easily. Of course, aside from keeping the scripture a secret, he also needed to use the clan's resources to develop the furnace before him.

With this in mind, Chen Daoxuan's gaze hardened with renewed determination. "No matter what, these five years haven't been completely wasted. Perhaps tomorrow will be the day I succeed!"

According to his vision, this furnace should be able to replace the cultivator's role in refining spirit ore—just like steel smelting furnaces in his past life. However, refining spirit ore differed significantly from refining ordinary ore in one crucial aspect: spiritual essence.

For ordinary iron ore, high-temperature smelting was sufficient. But spirit ore required not only melting but also fusing the spiritual essence within it. This was where Chen Daoxuan hit a wall. While he could manage high-temperature refining, merging spiritual essence—as recorded in artifact forging traditions—could only be done through a cultivator's spiritual sense.

The second-rank forging inheritance of his clan mentioned no other methods. Perhaps none existed in this world at all. Chen Daoxuan noticed that cultivators, regardless of the situation, always sought to rely on their own power rather than external tools—a fundamental difference from Earth's civilization.

Whether in alchemy, artifact forging, talisman crafting, or even combat, cultivators preferred to depend on their own strength. Even if a powerful magical artifact could provide an advantage in battle, cultivators still prioritized improving their own cultivation. This was also why alchemists were often more respected than artifact smiths.

Returning to the matter at hand, Chen Daoxuan had devoted all his efforts over the past five years to this furnace, aside from studying traditional forging knowledge. To say he had failed wasn't entirely accurate. He had divided the furnace's functions into five parts: the control system, the feed inlet, the heating and smelting system, the levitation system, and the discharge outlet.

The core of it all was the control system—Chen Daoxuan's proudest achievement. The driving array at its heart was his original creation, based on second-rank forging knowledge and his own ideas. By adjusting the distance between the spirit stones and the driving array using sliding rods, he could control the amount of spiritual energy received by the array, thereby regulating the furnace's internal temperature.

In other words, with this furnace, a few mortals working together could melt copper ore. The only remaining problem was how to fuse the spiritual essence of the ore—a challenge that had stumped Chen Daoxuan for nearly a year.

Encouraged by his success with the driving array, he leaned toward creating another new array to merge the spiritual essence, but so far, he had not succeeded.

Standing before the furnace, Chen Daoxuan held a stack of blueprints. A closer look revealed detailed schematics of the furnace, including orthographic and cross-sectional views—except for one blank area at the bottom. According to his design, this was where the array for merging spiritual essence should be inscribed.

"Ugh..." After a long silence, Chen Daoxuan sighed. The frustration of being so close yet unable to take the final step was unbearable.

After racking his brain until his head ached, he finally stopped. Setting the blueprints aside, he sat cross-legged and began reciting the Primordial Enlightenment Scripture.

For him, daily recitation of the scripture and cultivation of the "Return to Origin Technique" were non-negotiable routines. In fact, he recited the scripture more often than he practiced the technique—every time he exhausted himself forging artifacts, a single recitation would restore his vigor, making it a habit he never tired of.

As the scripture flowed through his mind, Chen Daoxuan sank into a state of chaos, oblivious to the passage of time or the flow of air, as if his consciousness had completely faded.

Soon, the time it took for an incense stick to burn passed. When he opened his eyes, his expression turned serious. This was already the ninth time. Previously, reciting the scripture had never produced such an effect. But in recent sessions, something new had begun to happen.

"I wonder if this change is good or bad..." Chen Daoxuan murmured, staring at the nine motes of stardust orbiting the golden scripture in his sea of consciousness like satellites. "What in the world are these things?"
