Chapter 116: The Terror of the Myriad Spirit Banner

"Don't panic! This is just one of his magic artifacts! No matter how powerful a magic artifact is, it requires sufficient true qi to activate. He is, after all, just one person!"

As a monk from Fulong Temple, Guanghui was clearly far superior and calmer than Guangming. At the very least, he stabilized the situation instantly, unlike Guangming, who only knew how to deceive and then flee. Soon, the Buddhist cultivators quickly formed a defense around him.

The next second, thousands of Witch-Ghouls swarmed forward.

"Amitabha!"

The Buddhist cultivator at the very front immediately let out a thunderous roar, his body erupting with golden light. With a single punch, he instantly swept away the Witch-Ghouls before him.

However, it was all in vain.

The subsequent Witch-Ghouls showed not the slightest hesitation. They even devoured the corpses of their fallen comrades, growing stronger before charging forward once more.

Boom!

The Witch-Ghouls didn't even intend to fight the Buddhist cultivators. As soon as they got close, they self-detonated, their bursting malevolent yin energy corroding the Buddhist cultivators' golden bodies like a potent poison.

"If I attain Buddhahood, and the heavenly beings in my land are not entirely golden in color, then I shall not attain Supreme Enlightenment."

At the center of the formation, Guanghui fully unleashed his true qi, blessing the surrounding Buddhist cultivators with the "Great Golden Body Mantra." The vast Buddhist light instantly evaporated all the malevolent yin energy.

"Hold the line! These Witch-Ghouls aren't strong!"

Guanghui could no longer afford to be compassionate. His face was grim, as he desperately tried to boost morale, and he wasn't speaking idly.

In fact, while the Witch-Ghouls in the Myriad Spirit Banner were numerous, only eight of them were comparable to those at Qi Condensation Completion, and all of them were crucial components of the Yama Hall. Lu Yang wouldn't send them into battle. Therefore, all the Witch-Ghouls that had acted so far were below Qi Condensation Completion and thus no match for the Buddhist cultivators.

However, if they received higher-realm authority augmentation, that would be a different story.

The next second, a Witch-Ghoul, only at the Qi Condensation Mid-stage, pounced on a Buddhist cultivator at the Qi Condensation Late-stage at the very front. A not-so-powerful malevolent qi surged forth.

Rip!

The golden body of the Qi Condensation Late-stage Buddhist cultivator, which should have been indestructible, seemed to weaken countless times over. It dramatically tore open under the malevolent qi's ripping force!

"Ah!"

The Buddhist cultivator screamed, desperately unleashing true qi to shake off the Witch-Ghoul clinging to him. However, more than ten Witch-Ghouls rushed up swiftly, instantly submerging him.

"How could this be...?"

Guanghui, witnessing this scene, nearly bit through his Buddhist teeth. With his insight, he could naturally tell that the normally weak Witch-Ghouls could effortlessly breach a golden body because they had received augmentation from a higher-realm authority. Their own power, conversely, was instantly greatly diminished due to their insufficient realm authority.

At this moment, Guanghui was utterly bewildered.

True Monarchs above! Foundation Establishment True Persons shouldn't be allowed into the secret realm! At the very least, no Foundation Establishment True Person could possibly hide from a True Monarch's divine eye.

Does this mean... this demonic fiend in front of me isn't at Foundation Establishment?

Damn it, and he's *not* at Foundation Establishment!?

However, the situation didn't allow him to ponder further. The outermost Buddhist cultivators were already crumbling, their golden bodies constantly collapsing after being corroded by the malevolent yin energy.

"Only... a decapitation strike will work!"

Guanghui looked up, his gaze falling upon Lu Yang, who stood behind the thousands of Witch-Ghouls. A bitter smile touched his lips, but it quickly faded, replaced by determination.

"If I attain Buddhahood, and there are hells, hungry ghosts, or beasts in my land, then I shall not attain Supreme Enlightenment."

"If I attain Buddhahood, and heavenly beings in my land, after the end of their lifespan, return to the three evil paths, then I shall not attain Supreme Enlightenment."

"If I attain Buddhahood, and the heavenly beings in my land are not entirely golden in color, then I shall not attain Supreme Enlightenment."

With lips parting and closing, Guanghui directly chanted three great mantras. In that instant, magnificent Buddhist light rapidly spread outwards from him as its center.

Within the Buddhist light, a temple faintly materialized.

Inside the temple, monks performed morning lessons, and thunderous Dharma teachings resonated. What a beautiful ancient temple with ringing bells! On the plaque above the main gate of the temple were three vigorously written characters:

Fulong Temple!

The next second, all the Buddhist cultivators melted into the Buddhist light, vanishing without a trace. Thousands of streams of Buddhist light converged, finally forming a towering golden Dharma manifestation.

"Dragon-Elephant Vast Strength Vajra Body!"

This was the most powerful Dharma combat method of the Pure Land Buddhist cultivators.

Pure Land cultivators practice the "Profound Joy and Nirvana Path," which involves annihilating the self and realizing one's own ephemeral nature, acknowledging that they are but another "self" of the Supreme World-Honored One when he delivers sentient beings from the mortal world.

Thus, the more a Buddhist cultivator comprehends their "true self," the closer they become to the World-Honored One who founded the Profound Joy and Nirvana Path, and the stronger the divine abilities and magical power they wield.

This characteristic also granted Buddhist cultivators a unique divine ability, different from other orthodoxies: when multiple Buddhist cultivators together perform a secret technique, unifying their consciousness into a single "self," they can transcend the limitations of their realm and borrow a higher level of realm-power from the Profound Joy Pure Land!

The higher the realm-power, the greater the number of Buddhist cultivators required.

For example, Buddhist cultivators at the Qi Condensation stage would need all Eight Legions of Buddhist Beings to be present to borrow a Foundation Establishment realm-power.

A single Buddhist legion, at most, could only form a realm-power close to Foundation Establishment, which would be a Dharma Protector Vajra, considered a high-ranker within the Qi Condensation stage.

At this moment, Guanghui unified the entire Dragon Host. Over a hundred Buddhist cultivators merged into one, and the "Dragon-Elephant Vast Strength Vajra Body" that manifested was truly a pinnacle among them!

"Evil spirits and monsters, you shall be slain!"

As his voice fell, Guanghui's Vajra body assumed a wrathful form, then charged into the hordes of Witch-Ghouls, pushing through the waves of ghouls towards Lu Yang.

However, the next second, that wrathful form transformed into an ineffable despair.

Because at the center of the thousands of Witch-Ghouls, a magnificent palace rose from the ground, commanding the obscure and seizing the profound. From within, a graceful and noble beautiful woman emerged.

Dharma Protector Deity Su Nü!

Although Su Nü couldn't receive the augmentation of the earth veins because she wasn't on Skull Mountain, she was still at the Foundation Establishment realm-power. She was not someone Guanghui could hope to contend with.

Boom!

Su Nü merely raised her jade hand and gently brought it down. Guanghui, in his Dragon-Elephant Vast Strength Vajra form, was immediately sent flying, crashing straight into the dust.

His golden body, once resplendent with Buddhist light, was shattered inch by inch by that single palm strike. Buddhist light flowed from his wounds, and every drop of blood that spilled from his injuries transformed into a Buddhist cultivator with eyes wide in indignation. Once the blood ceased flowing, this "Dragon-Elephant Vast Strength Vajra" would collapse without further attack.

In an instant, Guanghui felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.

He even felt a trace of resentment towards the Buddhist True Monarchs outside. *Damn it, how did you oversee this battle?! How could you let a Foundation Establishment True Person infiltrate the Dao-contention battlefield?*

*You animals!*

At this moment, Guanghui couldn't even see Lu Yang's figure anymore. All he saw was boundless malevolent yin energy, Witch-Ghouls, and the magnificent Yama Hall.

"Demonic fiend! If you dare, fight me one-on-one!"

Beneath the Myriad Spirit Banner, Lu Yang listened to Guanghui's furious roars while calmly toying with the sword pill in his hand. Cursing at the enemy before death was merely the wail of the defeated.

Besides, when Guanghui had charged at him with over a hundred Buddhist cultivators, he hadn't shown any intention of fighting him one-on-one. And now he suddenly wanted to fight one-on-one?

"I *am* fighting you one-on-one right now."

*You, one, against my many.*

Soon, a quarter of an hour later, the Buddhist light completely faded, leaving behind only corpses littering the ground.

"What excellent materials, can't let them go to waste..."

Lu Yang activated the Myriad Spirit Banner. The deceased Buddhist cultivators rose once more, even Guanghui, who had just been roaring at him, was among them, his face now filled with loyalty.

Behind Lu Yang, Qin Tianhe joyfully trotted over, holding a bald man.

"Senior, I caught one who tried to escape."

After speaking, he cautiously glanced at the Buddhist cultivators who had risen behind Lu Yang. While marveling at the sight, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly:

*We two are truly amazing.*

"...There are still some that slipped through the net?"

Lu Yang paid no mind to Qin Tianhe's emotions, instead looking at Guangming, who was disheveled in Qin Tianhe's hand. Seeing this, Guangming immediately raised his hands:

"Don't kill me! I have important information to provide!"

"Exalted Cultivator, spare my life!"
