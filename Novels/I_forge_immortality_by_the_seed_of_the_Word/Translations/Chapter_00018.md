# Chapter 18: Converging Forces, Setting the Goal (Combined)

About three li away from Zhang Jing's residence, a woman in white robes appeared before a small courtyard. She raised her delicate hand and knocked gently on the door, her red lips parting slightly: "Junior Sister Shen Qingqing, please come out for a moment."

The sudden voice attracted several hidden gazes from the surroundings. However, when they saw the beautiful figure, those gazes quickly retreated in fear.

Someone couldn't help but sigh: "That's Senior Sister Liu Nanshu from the Misty Isle. Why would she come here personally?"

"Tsk~ Since the Misty Team, ranked second in the outer court, has arrived, it means the competition between the top teams for those two top-tier geniuses is already over."

"There's no hope left. Let's go contact those second-tier junior brothers and sisters on the list."

In an instant, figures surrounded by spiritual light swiftly dispersed in different directions, moving faster and faster.

Meanwhile—

Creak—

The courtyard door opened, revealing a tall figure with a youthful face and a hint of cool elegance in her demeanor.

"Qingqing greets Senior Sister," Shen Qingqing said softly.

"My name is Liu Nanshu. You can call me Senior Sister Liu. Hmm—Junior Sister, you've already completed Qi Induction and stepped into the Qi Refining Realm? And judging by your aura, you must have already mastered an upper-grade inheritance, right?"

Liu Nanshu's beautiful face showed a trace of barely concealed astonishment.

At the same time, Shen Qingqing was equally unsettled. This "Senior Sister Liu" had seen through her true cultivation level at a glance? Over the past two days, several senior brothers and sisters had visited, but this was the first time her cultivation had been exposed so easily.

"Senior Sister, you can tell?" Shen Qingqing asked curiously.

"Of course," Liu Nanshu smiled lightly. "As expected of a top-tier genius. Your talent truly exceeds my expectations. But after all, you've only been cultivating for a few days, so your concealment technique isn't yet refined."

"Though, to be fair, this time I'm just taking advantage of my higher cultivation level," Liu Nanshu added.

"I see. Thank you for the guidance, Senior Sister."

Shen Qingqing suddenly understood and realized that this Senior Sister Liu's cultivation must be extraordinary.

"Junior Sister, I assume you already know the purpose of my visit, so I won't beat around the bush." Liu Nanshu's gaze burned with intensity as she declared confidently: "If you agree to join us, our Misty Team can offer whatever others can—and even what they can't!"

---

"Senior Sister, I still want to—"

Hearing this, Shen Qingqing bit her lip hesitantly.

"Junior Sister, hear me out first before making your decision."

"Starting today, you'll receive three bottles of Purple Spirit Pills every month, your choice of a mid-grade magical artifact, one mid-grade spell inheritance, and ownership of a high-grade cave abode. Moreover, all the Dao Merits you earn in the outer court will be yours to keep."

"In short, we will fully support your cultivation until you enter the inner court. How does my offer sound?"

With that, Liu Nanshu playfully blinked at Shen Qingqing.

"Senior Sister, what would I need to do in return?"

Shen Qingqing was tempted but remained cautious.

"You wouldn't need to do anything."

Meeting Shen Qingqing's doubtful gaze, Liu Nanshu said sincerely:

"With your talent, it won't take more than a few years for you to enter the inner court. All we ask is that, in the future, if our Misty Team ever faces a crisis, you remember this favor and lend us a hand."

"I swear on my Dao Heart—every word I've said is true, and the Dao Academy can bear witness!"

After a moment of silence, Shen Qingqing suddenly smiled brightly.

"Since Senior Sister has put it that way, then—"

"May I have a little more time to consider?"

---

In the guest room, Zhang Jing looked at the senior brother across from him with an apologetic expression.

"Senior Brother, this is a significant matter. Surely I can't make a decision immediately?"

Hearing this, the man's face momentarily showed surprise.

Then, he stared at Zhang Jing with disbelief and said sternly:

"Junior Brother Zhang, what's there to hesitate about?"

"Three bottles of spirit pills, two months' access to the standard cultivation chambers, plus a monthly stipend of thirty spirit stones! You might not know this, but the spiritual energy in those chambers rivals that of some cave abodes—they can greatly accelerate cultivation, and they're extremely expensive to use."

"As long as you join our Hundred Rivers Team, I can provide all of the above—no later than tomorrow. No, in fact, I can give them to you right now."

With that, the man fixed his gaze firmly on Zhang Jing.

"Junior Brother, the terms I'm offering are already very generous. Only the top ten teams could offer better. But those teams only focus on geniuses who might rank in the top ten of the assessment."

"Forgive my bluntness, but those geniuses either come from cultivation families with abundant resources or are just a hair's breadth away from top-tier talent—often both."

"Without exception, they've already begun Qi Induction in the past couple of days."

"And you, Junior Brother—"

The man's words abruptly stopped.

Though he didn't continue, Zhang Jing understood the implication: Junior Brother, you're still a step behind these people.

"It's not that I don't want to give you more—I simply don't have the authority."

The man spread his hands helplessly before adding:

"I'm not trying to discourage you, but this year's assessment has twenty-nine second-tier geniuses. Without the spirit pills and cultivation chambers we're offering, you might not even make the top twenty to earn the first-year reward of twenty Dao Merits per month."

"You should weigh the pros and cons carefully."

Seeing Zhang Jing's indifferent expression, the man pressed on:

"Junior Brother, our Hundred Rivers Team ranks thirty-fourth among all outer court mission teams. We have five mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators and one late-stage Qi Refining senior brother. When carrying out demon-subjugation missions, you'll not only have safety guarantees but also earn substantial Dao Merits."

"Do you know how many outer court disciples would fight tooth and nail for a chance to join us?"

"Only because you received a second-tier assessment were you invited."

Zhang Jing remained silent, as if weighing his options.

Finally, he smiled at the man and said:

"Thank you for your kindness, Senior Brother. But I still think it's best to consider this carefully."

Hearing this, the man wasted no more time. He stood up to leave, saying calmly:

"If Junior Brother insists, then I won't say more."

"My offer stands until the assessment rankings are finalized. Even if you rank outside the top twenty, you're welcome to join."

"Zhang Jing is honored by Senior Brother's regard!"

"Then I'll take my leave and stop disturbing you."

With that, the man strode out, his eyes reflecting a hint of emotion.

Though rejected, he felt no resentment. In Zhang Jing, he saw a reflection of his younger self.

But—did this junior brother truly think joining a top-ten team was so easy?

Based on his judgment, in previous years, Zhang Jing might have had a slim chance at the top ten. But this year—

Difficult. Extremely difficult.

Behind him, Zhang Jing watched the senior brother disappear before slowly closing the door, his eyes complex.

"Sigh, that's the third one. The others must be facing the same situation—if not worse."

---

To be honest, Zhang Jing had almost agreed this time.

Of the three groups that had approached him, this senior brother's offer was the most generous. Unfortunately—there were conditions Zhang Jing couldn't accept.

Especially one clause: For the first five years after joining, 30% of the Dao Merits earned by new members would go to the Hundred Rivers Team.

Similar terms had been proposed by all three teams.

From their words, Zhang Jing inferred that likely only the top-ten teams didn't impose such deductions.

In other words, this was an unspoken rule—unless you were strong enough.

Zhang Jing fell into deep thought.

The [Nether Python Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme·Fragment] had already demonstrated its extraordinary ability to gather and absorb spiritual energy during cultivation. Moreover, Zhang Jing sensed that the Dao Rhyme's power had yet to fully manifest—that would only happen after he officially stepped into the Qi Refining Realm.

And this was just a fragment!

Thus, whether for the unparalleled cultivation compatibility or to fully realize the terrifying [Nether Python Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme], the upper-grade method [Ocean-Turning Python Seizes Emptiness True Art] was something Zhang Jing absolutely had to obtain.

The only uncertainty was how quickly he could accumulate Dao Merits.

Under these circumstances, Zhang Jing couldn't accept the harsh condition of surrendering 30% of his Dao Merits for five years—even if joining a strong mission team would theoretically increase his overall earnings.

Unless—he joined a top-ten team.

They imposed no deductions and offered even greater platforms, naturally providing more opportunities to earn Dao Merits.

"So, I have another reason to fight for a top-ten ranking?"

At this thought, Zhang Jing felt the pressure intensify.

The competition was already fierce. Now, with countless mission teams actively recruiting geniuses and showering them with spirit pills, who knew how many monsters would emerge?

But then again—

Who wasn't a monster these days?

A translucent jade talisman slowly materialized before him.

[Five Organs Unlocking Water Origin Annotation·Uninitiated (29/70)]
[Pure Essence Breath Absorption Meditation·Level 1 (33/100)]

With nearly twenty days remaining, Zhang Jing was confident he could advance both techniques to Level 2.

So what if others reached the Qi Refining Realm first?

---

Calming his mind and steadying his breath, a phantom third eye slowly opened.

In the quiet cultivation chamber, the sound of scales sliding against each other was incessant, occasionally accompanied by the faint roar of a python.

The Nether Python Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme silently expanded, stirring the surrounding spiritual energy into tidal waves that instantly gathered within the chamber.

The sound of swallowing echoed.

"Senior Brother, I forgot to mention—wherever I am becomes a cultivation chamber," Zhang Jing murmured, his gaze serene.

"If the Dao Rhyme were complete, would my very presence create a cave abode? And beyond that—a blessed land?"

---

Four more days passed unnoticed.

In a small courtyard hidden within the woods, people gradually gathered.

In a secluded corner:

"Brother Zhang, this is Wu Mingyuan's courtyard. That guy has been hiding since he arrived, as if afraid I'd come for his spirit stones."

"It took me forever to find him."

Ji Bochang grumbled indignantly.

His appearance had undergone a dramatic transformation.

His embroidered brocade robe had been replaced by a moon-white gown adorned with golden cloud patterns, giving him an ethereal air. The erotic painting fan he once carried was now a white jade fan woven with cloud-silk threads.

The only constant was the explicit imagery on the fan—now even more scandalous, undoubtedly influenced by Zhang Jing's previous "guidance."

"Brother Ji, since Wu Mingyuan didn't receive a second-tier assessment, he probably isn't ready to face you yet. Why the rush?"

Zhang Jing said helplessly.

He had been peacefully cultivating in his courtyard when Ji Bochang suddenly summoned him. After some twists and turns, they arrived at this remote spot.

"Ah, Brother Zhang, you don't understand. After breaking through to the Qi Refining Realm, my spirit pill consumption has multiplied. I'm almost out. I planned to buy more at the Dragon Marsh Market, and then I happened to spot Wu Mingyuan nearby."

"Seeing him means it's fate! Might as well collect the bet and buy a couple more pills."

"I see. Then why drag me here?" Zhang Jing pointed at Ji Bochang's new outfit and fan, his expression darkening. "Surely not just to show off your senior sister's new gifts?"

"Haha, as expected of Brother Zhang—you guessed it instantly."

Ji Bochang adjusted his collar and stroked the fan proudly.

"Don't underestimate these, Brother Zhang. This robe is called 'Water-Fire Dharma Garment.' It's said to have two restrictions—water avoidance and fire resistance. Neither water nor fire can touch it. A true treasure."

"And this white jade cloud-silk fan is no ordinary item either. It has three restrictions: Misty Miasma, Mind-Clouding Fog, and Flame Cloud Qi. One wave releases obscuring mist, the second brings confusion, and the third summons fiery clouds to reduce enemies to ashes."

"All... given by your senior sister?"

Zhang Jing was dumbfounded.

He suddenly began to doubt: Between him and Ji Bochang, who was the real cheat protagonist?

Seeing Zhang Jing's increasingly dangerous gaze, Ji Bochang hurriedly explained:

"Brother Zhang, calm down! I was joking earlier."

"So the robe and fan are fake?"

"Of course not! These treasures were prepared by my Dao Companion to help me compete for a top-ten ranking."

"You—"

"Brother Zhang, I meant that out of those fifty spirit stones, twenty belong to you, remember? After we get them, I'll take you to the Dragon Marsh Market."

At this, Zhang Jing's eyes lit up.

"Brother Ji, does the market sell magical artifacts? Are they expensive?"

Seeing how well-equipped Ji Bochang was under his senior sister's guidance, Zhang Jing couldn't help but worry.

In terms of spiritual power and spells, with the jade talisman and his skills, he was confident he wouldn't lose to anyone.

But magical artifacts?

Bare-handed against magical artifacts?

Would that be underestimating his opponents—or overestimating himself?

"Well," Ji Bochang waved his fan (careful not to activate it), "twenty-five spirit stones might barely get you a low-grade magical artifact."

"That's a relief!" Zhang Jing exhaled, then eagerly urged, "Let's go collect those stones from Wu Mingyuan!"
