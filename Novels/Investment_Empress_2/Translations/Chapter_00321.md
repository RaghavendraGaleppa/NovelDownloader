# Chapter 321: How Dare You Ask Me to Abandon You?

The setting sun was as red as blood.

Their shadows stretched long and thin against the city walls, which were scarred by the ravages of war.

“Young Master Li!”

“Tsk, tsk, did everyone see it today? Young Master Li stood atop the city wall, not taking a single step back.”

“Indeed. He struck that Helian Wu dead with a single hammer.”

“Seeing him standing there makes me feel like I have an anchor in my heart.”

Wherever Li Mo walked, the weary eyes of the Qingmu Camp soldiers shone with reverence, as if they were witnessing victory itself.

As long as the Frost Immortal was still soaring through the sky.

As long as Young Master Li stood atop the city wall.

No matter what kind of enemy they faced, they had confidence in their hearts.

They had all forgotten.

Li Mo was actually only at the Divine Observation Realm. His cultivation wasn't much higher than theirs; in fact, he was on par with some of them.

He was even of an age similar to their own sons and nephews.

They only knew that such dazzling figures as Young Master Li and the Frost Immortal were fighting alongside them, never letting them down.

Young Master Li had used his physical body to block the siege ram and slain the long-renowned Helian Wu, who was rumored to unite the various tribes of the Southern Frontier.

Gazes filled with hope made Li Mo feel at a loss.

He turned his head and once again used his Providence Divine Eye to look into the distance.

**[Name: Han Zhen]**
**[Age: 22 (5330)]**
**[Constitution: Blood God Body]**
**[Realm: Nine Apertures of Divine Observation]**
**[Destiny: Purple]**
**[Evaluation: Former Grand Chancellor of the Great Shang Dynasty. After Yu destroyed Shang, due to possessing the Blood Phoenix Essence, he领悟ed the profundity of the Blood Phoenix Essence to a deeper level when his soul and body were on the verge of annihilation, allowing him to be reborn through a surrogate. He has now been reborn seven times.]**
**[Recent Encounter: He is determined to obtain the Xia Phoenix Qi, Blood Phoenix Essence, and Jade Phoenix God possessed by Ying Bing. After losing the Blood Phoenix Essence, he switched to cultivating the Demon Summoning Sutra, absorbing the power of the masses on a large scale, intending to regain the path of blood sacrifice by using the countless souls lost in the war. The more living beings die, the stronger his power becomes.]**

So, Han Zhen didn't care at all about how many people died.

Whether it was the people killed in the massacre or the defenders of Qingmu City, it was likely that even if his own people died, he wouldn't care anymore.

For the divine artifacts on the Frost Cube.

This former Grand Chancellor of the Great Shang would likely stake everything on this battle.

Qingmu City had won today, but that didn't mean there were no losses.

Tomorrow, the battle would be even more brutal.

The Providence Divine Eye, which had not yet been closed, swept over the soldiers present.

Ying Bing watched as the young man's figure paused, then reached out to smooth his wrinkled collar.

They had agreed to go eat, but as Li Mo walked, his direction unconsciously changed again.

The two walked past the city walls licked by the flames of war, all the way down to the central command tent. The generals were visibly fewer in number, yet they were still handling military affairs with fervent intensity.

Qu Sheng sat there with furrowed brows, reading the battle reports.

“Commander.”

Li Mo stood at the door and spoke softly.

Qu Sheng understood he wanted to speak privately, so he got up and walked out.

After a moment of silence, he forced a strained smile.

“Today counts as a great victory. Our casualty ratio is one to five.”

“Commander Qu, did the Prince of the South... never intend to come from the beginning?”

Silence.

Li Mo had just used his Providence Divine Eye. He saw that some soldiers died on the eighth day, others on the tenth day.

If the Prince of the South were to come, it would be impossible for soldiers to still be dying on the tenth day.

Qu Sheng's expression froze, then his eyelids drooped, and his raised head lowered slightly.

“Young Master Li is correct.”

“His Majesty issued a golden edict not long ago, ordering the Prince to return to the capital to report on his duties.”

“I sent the Young Marquis to invite the Prince, also looking for an excuse to have him return to a safe place. At the time, I also wanted Young Master Li to leave with him, until I witnessed your ability to come and go freely, moving thousands of miles.”

“If the Prince were to come, how could the Qingmu Camp have reached the point of lacking food and supplies? But I couldn't say it. If I did, the fighting spirit in the hearts of my brothers would surely dissipate.”

---

Ying Bing's deep, clear eyes flashed with a thoughtful light.

Thinking about it carefully.

The Prince of the South was himself a powerhouse of the Law Body Realm, and one of the few divine generals of the present age. In the army, he was enough to rival the Seventh Realm.

His death was itself abnormal.

Li Mo opened his mouth to speak.

Before he could, Qu Sheng pointed at the妖王's head on the city gate.

“Back when the Prince was still at the Outer Scenery Realm, he斩杀ed that wicked crocodile with his brothers. Then he stayed here, personally building this Qingmu City with his men in the vast marshes. Standing here, it feels as if the comrades who died on this land are all still here.”

“Even if the final outcome is the destruction of the city, I will die before the civilians.”

“The two of you, the battlefield is merciless. War is never a means to build a career and achieve glory. You have both witnessed this. In the future, when you soar through the nine heavens, if you hold a bit more compassion in your hearts, then my death will have some meaning.”

*A hero draws his sword in his prime, bringing another ten-year calamity upon the people...*

These words surfaced in Li Mo's heart.

“Go on.”

Qu Sheng patted Li Mo's shoulder and said for the second time.

After speaking, he rubbed his face and walked back into the camp with a confident expression on his face.

“Young Master Li just said that the second wave of supplies will be here soon!”

He had even found an excuse.

But the generals probably never imagined that this would be the second lie told in Commander Qu Sheng's life, a man whose words carried the weight of a nine-ton tripod.

They all clenched their fists, as if seeing the dawn of victory.

“Frost Cube, I'm hungry. Let's go eat.”

“Okay.”

Ying Bing withdrew the hand that was reaching for the big-headed doll, preparing to take out some candy.

Young Master Li had no heart to cook today.

It was just simple dry rations and meat and vegetable soup, the same as the soldiers in the army.

“Ying Bing, why don't we just leave?”

Li Mo held his bowl and suddenly looked into the distance with a relaxed expression. “Anyway, this city can't be held. We've done everything we could. We've fought with all our strength.”

“Do you really think so?” Ying Bing stared at him seriously.

“Mm.”

“You're lying to me.”

She leaned in close. Without even looking, Li Mo knew it was her, smelling the faint, cool fragrance.

Those eyes like ice mirrors must be able to see right through a person's heart.

“? I'm not.”

“Then dare you turn around and look me in the eyes and say it?”

“I don't dare!”

Li Mo was tough everywhere except his mouth. A pair of cool, slender hands immediately reached his cheeks and turned his head.

The Frost Cube's gaze, the forced version.

“You want to trick me into leaving first, then stay here alone, only leaving when the city is truly about to fall, right?”

“...Wow, Frost Cube, you're so smart.”

His scheme seen through, Young Master Li touched his nose.

It was simply unreasonable. Did the Frost Cube also know how to use the Providence Divine Eye?

Well, that's not the point.

The Frost Immortal was now pursing her lips, the look in her eyes saying she wasn't happy, and there was even a hint of mist.

She was angry.

She hadn't said it, but he knew what that look meant.

*How dare you make the decision for me, and ask me to abandon you?*
