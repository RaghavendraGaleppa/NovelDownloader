# Chapter 130: The Jade Pendant  

The inner garden was small, spanning only about twenty zhang in length and width, but it housed the most precious medicinal herbs. The Seven-Star Grass was the treasure of this garden.  

Lin Xuan hesitated for a moment before entering, first releasing his spiritual sense to scan the surroundings.  

According to Ouyang Qinxin's speculation, there was more than one Core Formation expert who had broken into this place. Moreover, the restrictions at the heart of the herb garden were formidable and not easily dismantled. Thus, Lin Xuan proceeded with caution.  

At first, he detected nothing unusual. But after a while, furious roars and the growls of demonic beasts echoed from the garden ahead, mixed with violent surges of spiritual energy.  

Lin Xuan's eyebrows rose slightly, and a thoughtful expression crossed his face.  

Gritting his teeth, a flash of determination appeared in his eyes. He activated his flight technique and headed toward the inner garden. *No risk, no reward.* If he wanted the immortal herb, he had to be willing to face danger.  

However, the scene inside was not what he had expected.  

The restrictions had already been broken, and the remnants of shattered formation tools littered the ground.  

Aside from a demonic beast crouching nearby, there was only a single corpse.  

The deceased bore a striking resemblance to Liu Hai, his eyes wide open and filled with unwillingness. In his hand, he clutched the broken remains of a weapon. Though only a fragment remained, it radiated an intimidating spiritual energy.  

"A fragment of a magic treasure?"  

The term flashed through Lin Xuan's mind, but what truly unsettled him was the demonic beast before him.  

Neither lion nor tiger, it seemed a hybrid of the two, with a spiked tail and the size of a wild elephant.  

*A Lion-Tiger Beast!*  

Lin Xuan's pupils contracted slightly. No wonder it had been able to kill a Core Formation expert—this was a top-tier third-grade demonic beast.  

The cultivators of the Breezy Cloud Sect were no fools. Though the Nascent Soul Formation Ceremony had stretched their manpower thin, they would never neglect security in such a crucial place as the herb garden.  

Especially the inner garden, where the herbs were invaluable. Though the Sword Immortal of Taibai had departed, the sect had stationed their strongest guardian beast here.  

A top-tier third-grade demonic beast was equivalent to a Core Formation Great Perfection cultivator. Killing Liu Tong, who was only at the early Core Formation stage, was effortless. Liu Tong had sought revenge against the Breezy Cloud Sect, only to meet his end with a shattered core.  

Facing the beast, Lin Xuan felt a chill run down his spine. At his current strength, he wouldn't survive a single strike from it.  

Yet, the Lion-Tiger Beast merely glanced at him before lazily lying back down.  

*Was it because of my disguise?* Lin Xuan was overjoyed. Testing his luck, he cautiously took a step forward. But before his foot could touch the ground, the beast let out a low growl, forcing him to hastily retreat.  

He shook his head with a bitter smile. He had been too optimistic. Unlike cultivators, demonic beasts distinguished friend from foe through spiritual sense. He had known this, yet still harbored foolish hopes.  

But Lin Xuan didn't give up. After several attempts, he discovered that as long as he stayed at least five steps away from the spirit herbs, the Lion-Tiger Beast would ignore him. Any closer, and it would attack.  

Lin Xuan didn't dare cross that line—a third-grade demonic beast was beyond his ability to handle.  

But how could he steal the Seven-Star Grass under these circumstances?  

Time was running short. The disturbance in the herb garden wouldn't remain hidden for long. If more Breezy Cloud Sect experts arrived, escape would be impossible.  

Yet, leaving empty-handed was unacceptable.  

After a moment of contemplation, a glint of resolve flashed in Lin Xuan's eyes. *I'll take the gamble!*  

He reached into his robes and pulled out a handful of spirit stones from his storage pouch, then hurled them far into the distance.  

This wasn't a random act. Lin Xuan knew that most demonic beasts were drawn to spirit stones. His plan was to lure the beast away.  

With a flash of yellow light, the Lion-Tiger Beast indeed left its spot and chased after the stones.  

Seizing the opportunity, Lin Xuan dashed forward at full speed, reaching for a small plant with seven leaves—the Seven-Star Grass.  

But before his fingers could touch it, an earth-shaking roar erupted. A tremendous force slammed into him, sending him flying backward.  

Looking up, Lin Xuan's soul nearly left his body. The Lion-Tiger Beast was charging at him, eyes blood-red with fury.  

His expression darkened. He had underestimated the beast's speed.  

*Danger!*  

Though he knew he stood no chance, Lin Xuan refused to simply wait for death. He flicked his storage bracelet, intending to summon a spirit artifact.  

But in his panic, he fumbled and pulled out a jade pendant instead.  

It was one of the mysterious treasures he had obtained at the Stream-Leaping Gorge. Despite studying it multiple times, he had never uncovered its purpose.  

Though it undoubtedly held some profound secret, it was neither a magic treasure nor a spirit artifact. Drawing it now seemed like a fatal mistake.  

Yet something strange happened.  

The pendant emitted a soft glow. When the ferocious Lion-Tiger Beast touched the light, its killing intent vanished, replaced by docility.  

Lin Xuan was stunned.  

He glanced at the pendant in his hand, realizing the light originated from the intricate patterns carved into it.  

Saved from certain death, Lin Xuan was both shocked and overjoyed. But now wasn't the time to ponder the pendant's mysteries. He cautiously reached for the Seven-Star Grass again, keeping an eye on the beast.  

No reaction.  

Gritting his teeth, Lin Xuan plucked the herb and stored it in his pouch. Then, with a flick of his wrist, he sent a beam of white light to sweep over the Core Formation expert's corpse before swiftly leaving the inner garden.  

Uncertain of the outcome of Ouyang Qinxin and Liu Hai's battle, Lin Xuan wisely chose an alternate route out of the herb garden.  

He didn't return to the Cloud Sea.  

If the herb garden incident was discovered, leaving the Breezy Cloud Sect would become difficult.  

Fortunately, the main events of the Nascent Soul Formation Ceremony had concluded, and visiting cultivators were free to depart.  

Lin Xuan dispelled the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art, reverting to his true appearance, and smoothly exited the Breezy Cloud Sect.  

By evening, he had traveled halfway to his destination. Seeing that night had fallen, he stopped at a desolate mountain.  

Finding a hidden cave, he set up several warning restrictions before releasing Lin Yue'er.  

"Young Master!"  

The little wraith had grown stronger, mastering most of the ghost cultivation manual Lin Xuan had given her. Soon, she would need a higher-tier technique.  

Pleased with her progress, Lin Xuan smiled. Since she was bound to him by a blood pact, her strength directly benefited him.  

"Yue'er, keep watch for me."  

"Yes, Young Master!"  

Once the wraith had flown out of the cave, Lin Xuan calmly retrieved several items.  

First was the Seven-Star Grass. Though unremarkable in appearance, Lin Xuan handled it with reverence, carefully storing it in a jade case.  

Next, he examined a blackened fragment—the remains of a magic treasure retrieved from the Core Formation expert's corpse.  

Thinking about it, Lin Xuan felt a twinge of frustration. Despite stumbling upon a fallen Core Formation expert, he had found no storage pouch on him. This fragment was his only gain.  

Though it pulsed with powerful spiritual energy, Lin Xuan couldn't help feeling dissatisfied.  

Shaking his head, he reminded himself not to be greedy and stored the fragment away.  

Finally, he took out the jade pendant.  

He had acquired it at the Stream-Leaping Gorge, a treasure the Fire Spirit Sect had desperately sought, even at the cost of making enemies.  

For the longest time, Lin Xuan had failed to uncover its purpose, nearly forgetting about it in his storage pouch.  

Yet today, a simple mistake had turned into a blessing. Without the pendant, not only would he have failed to obtain the Seven-Star Grass, but he would have also perished under the Lion-Tiger Beast's claws.  

But why had it pacified the beast?  

Lin Xuan turned the pendant over in his hands, scrutinizing it closely.  

Half an hour passed with no revelations.  

Just as he sighed and prepared to put it away, he suddenly paused.  

Holding the pendant up, he examined it with his spiritual sense. After a moment of thought, he retrieved a talisman from his storage ring—the Soaring Bird Beast Talisman.  

He had used it once before, so some of its energy had been depleted.  

Grasping the pendant in one hand and the talisman in the other, Lin Xuan took a deep breath and channeled his spiritual power into the pendant.  

Instantly, it emitted a radiant glow...
