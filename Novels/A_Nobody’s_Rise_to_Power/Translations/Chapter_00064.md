Chapter 64: The Mirror Demon and the Medusa

“Mirror Demon” was brought up.

Her name alone hinted at her allure, especially when compared to the Medusa who had come before her.

However, when the “Mirror Demon” walked into the hall, her completely unexpected presence shocked everyone.

Was she beautiful? Absolutely!
Was she enchanting? It seemed so.
But... there was something... however... just...

She wore a plain-colored garment that shimmered as if bathed in a thin layer of moonlight. Her figure was light and serene, as if she weren't stepping on the ground but floating within a halo of pure light.

As soon as she entered the hall, she pulled off the green cloth covering her head. The handsome young man beside her couldn't stop her in time. She stood there calmly and quietly, like an orchid in a deep valley—uncompeting, yet possessing a natural fragrance.

Once the green cloth was removed, her hair was revealed. It was only an inch long!

Which young girl would shave off her beautiful hair?
She was clearly a nun. The lack of a burn mark on her head was normal, as branding was not an original Buddhist system. In Yang Can’s world, this system began in the Yuan Dynasty. In this world, such a rule apparently didn't exist yet.

Extremely beautiful women are rare; a woman with such beauty and such an ethereal temperament is even rarer. Having temperament is usually a good thing, but hers... it was too ethereal. Pure and flawless to the point where one couldn't bear to defile her.

Although she wasn't wearing a nun’s robe, her dignified aura was too transparent and distant. She stood there silently, seemingly accepting all arrangements of fate calmly. Her extra sense of ethereal tranquility made it impossible for anyone to harbor any defiling thoughts. One only wanted to... press their palms together in respect for her.

Yang Can, Leopard Head, and Little Green Plum all looked at Manager Qian simultaneously.
*Are you crazy?*

Yang Can suddenly remembered the scene from *Young and Dangerous* where the "Black Crow"哥 stepped on the Guan Gong statue. This human trafficker really had no taboos; he dared to kidnap and sell a nun? Who would dare to buy her?

Manager Qian was also bitter inside. When he received the goods, he hadn't discovered the girl's identity. At the time, his supplier had wrapped her head in a green cloth; it wasn't like this. Now she looked like a "living Bodhisattva"; this was going to be the death of him.

In Longshang and even the Western Regions, the worship of Buddhism was prevalent. Even the most unruly and unscrupulous young masters of noble families wouldn't dare to take this woman. They themselves might not respect the gods or Buddhas, but they couldn't stop the elders in their families from believing. If they brought her home, the consequences would be terrible.

But Manager Qian refused to take a loss, or his mind wouldn't be at peace. So this "money-losing goods" had been held in his hands. Manager Qian knew that even though the local tycoon in front of him had no experience, he would still be wary of such things.

So, he put on a smile and said, "This woman is named Mirror Demon..."

The girl in the plain clothes pressed her palms together and said calmly, "This nun's Dharma name is Jingyao."

Manager Qian’s words caught in his throat, and his smile became strained. "She is skilled in blending incense, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement. Your Lordship's manor is so magnificent; you need a servant like this."

Yang Can looked at Manager Qian with disgust. *Do you think I'm an idiot? Huh? Do I look like I lack common sense?*

He looked at the "Mirror Demon" again. Her dignity didn't come from external majesty, but from an extreme "emptiness." It was like high-quality porcelain from the official kilns of the Song Dynasty; the glaze was thick and moist, yet it pursued the tranquility and loftiness of "sky-blue glaze." Or like a jade Buddha; although the carving was simple, the warm and smooth material expressed endless peace and compassion to the fullest.

*Amitabha!*
*Take her away, take her away~~~*

Before Green Plum could speak, Yang Can waved his hand repeatedly. "Forget it, forget it, Manager Qian, don't harm me."

Manager Qian hurriedly said, "My Lord, just consider it an act of kindness. Keeping her to make incense and arrange flowers for your noble house is a good thing!"

"Why don't you show some kindness, Manager Qian?"
"I'm a slave trader. If I show kindness, how can I continue doing business?"
"Huh? That actually makes sense!"

While Yang Can was bickering with him, Green Plum's eyes darted around, and she gently tugged on Yang Can's sleeve. "Master, why don't we take in Master Jingyao? We can send her back to the temple later... If we turn a blind eye and she ends up being bought by someone with no scruples, I'm afraid..."

Green Plum was also a believer in Buddhism. She was instantly conquered by Master Jingyao's unparalleled temperament and wanted to do a good deed.

Yang Can was indeed wary of Master Jingyao's identity, especially her aura like a white jade Guanyin. He couldn't bring himself to do anything to her. Even if he just used her as a laborer, he would feel like he was defiling her. Asking her to wipe tables and sweep floors? A sin, a sin.

Buying her and sending her back to the temple? It wasn't impossible. He could consider it accumulating merit for the child in Little Suo's belly. However, he couldn't let Green Plum become arrogant just because she was favored; she needed to learn some discipline.

Thinking of this, Yang Can glanced sideways at Green Plum. "Alright, the expense will be deducted from your wages."

"Huh? Master, you're accumulating merit, why deduct my money?"
"It was your suggestion, so you should be the one to accumulate the merit. Besides, you're already my person. Doesn't your accumulating merit count as me accumulating merit?"

Little Green Plum didn't pay attention to the other words; she only heard "you're my person." The little girl's heart sweetened, and she said happily, "Alright then, deduct it from my monthly wages."

Having successfully tricked her, Yang Can turned to Manager Qian with a smile. "Manager Qian, you heard that? Name your price."

Manager Qian gritted his teeth and said, "Thirty bolts of silk, Mirror Demon is yours!"

Yang Can shook his head. "Forget it, we aren't going to accumulate this merit."

Manager Qian slapped his thigh hard and said with hatred, "Twenty bolts! Just twenty bolts, okay? She can do flower arranging, incense making, playing the zither, and tea serving. All kinds of elegant skills, absolutely presentable! To be honest with Lord Yang, I spent thirty bolts to acquire her!"

"Is that so..." Yang Can thought for a moment. "Then how about... you throw in two more servants? I'm not picky, just give me whatever."

Ordinary servants cost only three to five bolts. If they were of lower quality, they might cost less than three bolts. However, Manager Qian was also a man who haggled over every penny. Mainly, he was here to make money, and his mind had to be at peace.

Manager Qian gritted his teeth and held up one finger. "One. I'll throw in one more servant, how about it?"

Yang Can nodded. "Alright, it's a deal."

Master Jingyao stood there. Being sold was clearly an unhappy event, but to have to throw in a "bonus" for someone to even want her... it made her feel quite uncomfortable.
*Just who do I think I am...*

Yang Can settled the deal immediately and sent people to the warehouse to transport the silk and绢 (bolts of silk). The people sent to carry the goods were the slaves he had just bought.

Manager Qian sent a handsome young man to check the goods and quietly instructed another handsome young man. "Go, bring the driver, Old Xin, as the 'bonus'. Don't let that black-hearted thief Yang Can find out he's lame."

The handsome young man nodded in understanding and turned to leave.

Manager Qian was very satisfied with this transaction. He had sold a third of his "inventory" at once, which was considered a big deal in Tianshui City.

Yang Can paid mainly with绢 (bolts of silk), along with other items like satin. In fact, porcelain could also be used as currency, but silk was lighter and easier to transport. Among the treasures left by Zhang Yunyi, there were no shortage of large utensils made of precious metals. He had managed Feng'an Manor for decades; as a local tyrant, the wealth he had accumulated was quite astonishing.

After personally torturing and killing his own brothers and nephews, Zhang Yunyi seemed to have seen the light. He only took some convenient valuables and left the rest for Yang Can. Li Damu knew the market value of these items and calculated the prices on the spot for the handover.

Manager Qian was in the human trade business and traveled to various places, so he naturally did other trades as well. He had his own channels to liquidate these assets, and the exchange rates might even be higher than Li Damu's valuation.

After the handover was completed, Manager Qian smiled and said, "Lord Yang is a generous man. I often come to Tianshui City. If you have business in the future, just send a word."

After saying that, Manager Qian "casually" pointed to a person standing by the roadside. "This is the 'bonus' I threw in. See if you are satisfied."

Since it was a "bonus," and Yang Can had said he wasn't picky, there was no need to inspect it. Besides, Yang Can looked at the man. He was in his early forties. Although his beard was messy, his arms exposed through the linen vest were quite sturdy. That was enough; he could do heavy labor.

Yang Can nodded and agreed readily. Manager Qian sighed in relief. This Old Xin was indeed quite good. It was just how business worked. Since someone paid for it, they didn't want something defective. Those who could afford servants were respectable people. Having a lame servant at home would look bad if guests saw it.

Today, he had sold all the troublesome goods in one go to this rural tycoon. It was truly satisfying!

Manager Qian boarded his luxurious carriage with his two "living perfume bottles" and drove off flamboyantly.

Returning to the main hall of the manor and sitting down again, Yang Can felt that he finally had some of the dignity of a manor lord. These servants from the inner and outer courtyards, plus the guards organized by Leopard Head, had added seventy or eighty people to the Yang Mansion all at once. The huge manor finally had some life in it.

Yang Can left the placement and duties of these newly bought servants entirely to Green Plum and Leopard Head. However, the blue-eyed Medusa and the shorthaired Master Jingyao were clearly top-tier servants, and how to place them was a bit of a headache.

The Yang Mansion didn't even have a music troupe yet; the so-called dancers were just a concept for now. Looking at the red-haired wildcat who was watching him warily, ready to pounce and reveal her claws at any moment, Yang Can couldn't immediately bring up his idea of opening a trade route. Although everyone in the manor was trustworthy now, Yang Can didn't want to let them know about some of his plans and intentions in advance.

Let this little wildcat continue to misunderstand.

Yang Can thought for a moment and sent her to the back courtyard to make his bed and serve his daily needs. His business plan was still just a concept in his mind; he couldn't just feed her for nothing. This was called making full use of resources.

What made Yang Can headache the most was the Mirror Demon.

Medusa was sent away, and Yang Can looked at the Mirror Demon again. The Mirror Demon was also looking at him. Her eyes were as clear as a cold pond after rain. Although they reflected the light of the sky and the clouds, there wasn't a single ripple. It gave a feeling that she was a successful practitioner with deep cultivation.

"Little Master..." Yang Can looked at her shorn head. "Where is your place of cultivation?"

The Mirror Demon smiled faintly. Her extremely pale cherry lips curved slightly. This had nothing to do with sadness or joy; it was a kind of tranquility after total enlightenment.

"This nun's place of cultivation was raided by bandits. My fellow nuns were killed, and the temple was burned to the ground. This nun... cannot return."

Yang Can was dumbfounded. *What does this mean? Why can't I get rid of her?*

*No way, the Yang family doesn't keep idlers. I'm not going to keep a home-raised nun.*

Yang Can said, "In that case, I will look for a suitable temple and send you there to 'stay temporarily'. With your qualifications, I believe you will be able to 'settle down' there very soon."
