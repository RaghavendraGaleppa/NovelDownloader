# Chapter 19: Magic Arts

Li Shiming sat in the pavilion. Several days had passed since the autumn examinations ended, yet he paid no attention to the results.

Today, he wasn't practicing the "Five Elements Absorption Technique"—not out of laziness, but because the four glowing stones on his spirit-gathering plate had dimmed. Without the plate attracting spiritual energy, practicing the technique was virtually useless.

Rather than wasting time on ineffective cultivation, he turned his attention to studying magic arts.

The contents of three spells—"Spring Breeze and Rain Technique," "Geng Metal Technique," and "Earth Spirit Technique"—flowed through his mind. He had mentally simulated the casting processes countless times.

Li Shiming had long dismissed the servants from the garden, seeking solitude. Unless it was his father, Li Wenyuan, no one dared to disobey his orders. At this hour, Li Wenyuan was occupied with official duties, leaving the garden to Li Shiming alone.

"Spring Breeze and Rain Technique," he murmured, tracing patterns in the air with his fingers.

Spiritual energy shimmered faintly along the path of his fingers. With the assistance of the IBM z15 mainframe server, he flawlessly executed the most complex rune formations of the technique, which required precise adjustments of spiritual energy output. The slightest error would cause the spell to fail.

The arcane rune of spiritual energy hovered before him as he awaited the first manifestation of the spell. Yet, after several seconds, the rune dissipated without producing the small rain cloud described in the manual.

"Where did I go wrong?" he pondered, reviewing the manual's contents once more. He was confident in his understanding and execution—there had been no mistakes.

This failed attempt had drained a third of the spiritual energy within his dantian's vortex. He wasn't sure how long it would take to replenish, so he needed to identify the issue before attempting again. Otherwise, his limited energy reserves wouldn't last.

"Intent guides the spell," Li Shiming recalled a previously overlooked line.

He had assumed this meant simply willing the spell into existence, but this interpretation had led to failure. Considering himself adept with mental focus—given his experience manipulating the server space through consciousness—he thought the "intent" referred to mental will. If so, the spell should have worked.

He revisited Shi Ximing's cultivation notes but found little about the "Spring Breeze and Rain Technique," nor any explanation of "intent."

At this moment, Li Shiming realized the value of a teacher. The manual, though detailed, lacked the foundational knowledge a beginner needed—every minor assumption could become an obstacle.

After reorganizing the spellcasting process in his mind, he remained certain that his execution matched the manual's instructions, thanks to the IBM z15's precision. Before his spiritual energy had been sufficient, he had rehearsed the motions repeatedly without actual energy expenditure.

"Could 'intent' mean embodying the essence of spring rain?" A spark of insight struck him.

But how to evoke such an essence?

He devised a solution. From the IBM z15's database, he retrieved footage of spring rain and projected it directly into his vision. Immersed in the misty rain, he felt seeds sprouting and trees budding. The projection, displayed through his eyes, surpassed even the immersion of 3D movies from his past life.

"Not enough," he muttered. He sensed he was on the verge of understanding but remained just short of grasping the true essence. Given time—perhaps days—he might naturally achieve it.

But he had a better idea. He entered the IBM z15's Linux system. Previously, he had linked his vision to the server's display and scanning functions. Now, he aimed to connect all five senses as input-output devices, allowing sensory data to be both recorded and simulated.

To facilitate this, he wrote a program—a task that would have taken days in his past life. But with his consciousness interfaced with the IBM z15's 190 CPUs, code segments materialized as he thought. His control over the server's hardware enabled him to write highly efficient, low-level programs akin to assembly language.

In just five minutes, the sensory integration program was complete.

He loaded simulated sensations—gentle breezes, raindrops, the scent of damp earth—into his senses and replayed the spring rain footage. Standing on soft, moist soil, he felt the wind, smelled the earth, and sensed the rain's vitality.

"This is the essence of spring rain," Li Shiming whispered.

Instinctively, he channeled spiritual energy, tracing the intricate runes of the "Spring Breeze and Rain Technique" in the air. The rune hovered briefly before exploding into a small, roiling rain cloud. Tiny flashes of lightning flickered within as raindrops fell. The shower lasted for the time it took to drink a cup of tea before the cloud faded.

Li Shiming stared in awe. Had anyone else been present, the sight would have been astonishing. The spell's range was modest—about twenty square meters—far from the legendary feats of immortals. Yet, for a low-level plant-growth spell at the second layer of Qi Refining, the effect was impressive.

The cloud hung low, and the garden's carefully designed layout—with its winding paths and partitioned views—ensured it remained hidden from outside observers.
