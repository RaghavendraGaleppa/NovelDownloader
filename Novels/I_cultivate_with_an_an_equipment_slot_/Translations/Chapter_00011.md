# Chapter 11: The Visit  

"Greetings, Senior Sister Lin."  

Zhang Yan politely addressed Lin Qiuying.  

"Junior Brother Zhang, just returned from Enlightenment Peak?" Lin Qiuying asked casually.  

"Yes, I learned a new spell," Zhang Yan replied.  

"What spell was it?"  

"The Wood Origin Technique."  

Zhang Yan didn't hesitate to answer.  

"Ah, the Wood Origin Technique. That’s quite a useful spell for a spirit farmer," Lin Qiuying remarked, her tone laced with an inexplicable hint of disdain.  

"Indeed, I find it quite practical," Zhang Yan replied with a smile, pretending not to catch her sarcasm.  

"Someone like you will remain a spirit farmer for life," she sneered.  

"And where might Senior Sister be employed, if I may ask?"  

Zhang Yan's expression turned cold. He couldn't fathom why Lin Qiuying harbored such hostility toward him. Out of respect for Old Lin, he had already tolerated her once, yet she persisted in her provocation. Though Zhang Yan was generally amiable, he was no pushover.  

"Me?" Lin Qiuying lifted her chin proudly. "I'm a disciple of the Ten Thousand Talismans Peak!"  

The Ten Thousand Talismans Peak, like the Wood Spirit Peak, was one of the five main peaks of the Qingheng Sect, specializing in talisman crafting. The remaining three peaks were the Thousand Treasures Peak (for artifact forging), the Hundred Formations Peak (for array studies), and the Qingheng Peak—the sect’s main peak, where disciples focused on combat prowess.  

These five peaks collectively formed the Qingheng Sect, with Qingheng Peak holding nominal supremacy due to its historical significance and martial strength.  

Disciples of the five peaks were divided into two categories: those personally mentored by peak masters or elders, and those admitted based on talent who received collective instruction from senior disciples or elders.  

Lin Qiuying belonged to the latter group. Though her status wasn’t as prestigious as the first, she was still an inner sect disciple—a distinction far above Zhang Yan’s current standing.  

"Now you see the gap between us?" Lin Qiuying gloated. "So don’t entertain any foolish notions. We’re from entirely different worlds! A spirit farmer will always be a spirit farmer, while I will become a talisman master!"  

Zhang Yan: "......?"  

He was utterly baffled. Was this woman mentally unstable? Why was she spouting such nonsense?  

At that moment, Old Lin hurried over, pulling Lin Qiuying aside with an apologetic look.  

"Brother Zhang, my apologies. Qiuying has always been headstrong. I thought you two might get along given your similar ages, but it seems I’ve caused a misunderstanding." Old Lin’s expression was troubled.  

Lin Qiuying was his daughter, talented enough to be admitted to the Ten Thousand Talismans Peak, but her arrogance often led to conflict.  

Old Lin, though not particularly strong in cultivation, prided himself on his discernment. From his observations, Zhang Yan was no ordinary talent—his rapid progress in Qi refinement and spell mastery hinted at great potential. Combined with his humble demeanor, Old Lin believed Zhang Yan would rise far in the future.  

Thus, he had hoped to introduce his daughter to Zhang Yan, offering his savings to support them both. But Lin Qiuying’s abrasive attitude had ruined the opportunity.  

"No harm done," Zhang Yan replied calmly, glancing at Lin Qiuying. To him, she was nothing more than a self-important fool. Her pride in being a Ten Thousand Talismans Peak disciple meant little—after all, Mu Sen had already promised to recommend him to the Wood Spirit Peak’s master once he mastered the Wood Origin Technique.  

With the Enlightenment Mat, Zhang Yan could easily claim mastery, though he preferred to avoid drawing excessive attention. He aimed to be an unremarkable genius—someone who reaped the sect’s benefits without becoming a target.  

"Let me treat you to a drink today. Qiuying may be sharp-tongued, but she means well," Old Lin offered with a smile.  

Before Lin Qiuying could retort, a streak of sword light descended upon the spirit herb garden.  

A Foundation Establishment cultivator had arrived.  

Lin Qiuying’s arrogance vanished instantly, replaced by deference.  

The sword halted mid-air, revealing its rider.  

"Greetings, Elder!"  

Lin Qiuying and Old Lin immediately bowed. The elder, however, barely acknowledged them—a common reaction, given the vast gap in status.  

"Senior Brother Mu, what brings you here?"  

Zhang Yan recognized the newcomer—it was Mu Sen.  

"I just finished lecturing and realized I forgot to mention something important," Mu Sen said, stepping off his sword. "Some of the spirit seeds I gave you require special conditions to sprout. It’s common knowledge on Wood Spirit Peak, but I overlooked it earlier. Let me explain briefly now. The rest, you’ll learn once you formally join the peak and meet our master."  

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Zhang Yan bowed gratefully.  

Meanwhile, Old Lin and Lin Qiuying stood frozen in shock.
