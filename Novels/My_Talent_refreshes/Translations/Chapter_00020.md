# Chapter 20: I Know the Growth Spell  

The three of them entered the market, and a lively scene unfolded before Chu Ning's eyes.  

"High-quality talismans for sale! Attack and defense talismans available!"  

"Premium spirit rice from the Chen Family, guaranteed quality!"  

...  

Just a few steps into the market, Chu Ning was greeted by a chorus of hawkers, leaving him both amused and slightly surprised. He hadn't expected the market of the cultivation world to be so similar to those in the mortal realm.  

Of course, the goods sold here were all related to cultivation—talismans, spirit plants, magical artifacts, and elixirs—a dazzling array that truly broadened Chu Ning's horizons.  

Qiu Shunyi, who had visited twice before, acted as their guide.  

"The shops near the outskirts mostly belong to smaller cultivation families, so the quality of their goods is relatively lower. The further you go toward the center, the more powerful the families become. The very center is dominated by major shops from our Qingxi Sect and other large merchants."  

Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. "Isn’t our Qingxi Sect’s shop the largest in Qinghe Market?"  

"No," Qiu Shunyi shook his head. "From what Senior Brother Shang told me, the largest shop here is the Yunhai Pavilion. In fact, Yunhai Pavilion is the biggest in all the markets along the Qingxia Mountain Range.  

After all, major sects like ours have many disciples, and most high-quality resources are used internally. Yunhai Pavilion, however, specializes in business with cultivators, often selling rare treasures."  

Chu Ning nodded in understanding.  

As they strolled around, Chu Ning quickly noticed that the market wasn’t just about selling—there were plenty of requests for purchases as well.  

Some shops openly advertised: "Buying all kinds of spirit herbs!" or "Purchasing spirit beasts!" Others even posted hiring notices, some of which contained bizarre requests that left Chu Ning baffled.  

"Bloodmoon Cow about to lactate—seeking a beastmaster to perform a Milk-Inducing Spell (must be able to cast instantly). Price negotiable."  

"Spiritbreath Grass requires growth acceleration—seeking a plant cultivator to perform a Growth Spell (must be able to cast instantly). Price negotiable."  

...  

Pointing at one of the notices, Chu Ning asked Qiu Shunyi, "Do any of our sect’s disciples take on jobs like these?"  

Qiu Shunyi chuckled, recalling his own initial surprise. "Of course. These notices are actually aimed at people like us.  

The Qingxi Sect has many outer disciples, and everyone needs resources for cultivation. The sect actually allows us to earn some extra income on the side."  

He continued, "But from what Senior Brother Shang told me, most of these hiring requests come from cultivation families affiliated with the sect or a few major merchants who have formal partnerships with us.  

Random outsiders can’t just post hiring notices—the sect doesn’t want its disciples working too much for other factions."  

Chu Ning nodded again, then asked curiously, "Do many of our sect’s disciples take on these jobs?"  

"From what I know, not many," replied Lü Xingyuan, who had been mostly silent until now.  

"The senior disciple I used to follow mentioned that these cultivation families usually have their own people who know basic spells. They only post hiring notices when they have special requirements.  

The rewards they offer aren’t great—sometimes just a few spirit fragments. For example, when it comes to plant cultivation, only disciples from the Dizi District might consider it, but most of them can’t meet the spell requirements.  

So usually, only a senior from the Bingzi District, who happens to be in dire need of spirit stones, would take on such jobs."  

Chu Ning suddenly understood. Though this was his first time in the market, he wasn’t completely ignorant after months in the cultivation world.  

Spirit fragments were incomplete spirit stones with less concentrated spiritual energy, making them less valuable than whole stones.  

For example, a standard low-grade spirit stone weighed about ten taels. But if exchanging with fragments, it might take twelve or even thirteen taels to match one, and most people wouldn’t even bother.  

Disciples from the Bingzi District, who were at the mid-stage of Qi Refining, likely wouldn’t care much for a few spirit fragments.  

After all, those who could cast spells instantly were usually already earning decently from their own cultivation efforts.  

At this thought, Chu Ning’s heart stirred.  

These people might not care for such small rewards, but he certainly did!  

He hadn’t learned the Milk-Inducing Spell, but he did know the Growth Spell!  

Now at the fourth level of Qi Refining, he had mastered spells like Growth, Purification, and Verdant Spring—with Growth and Purification already castable instantly.  

If he took on these jobs, he could earn some spirit fragments.  

Moreover, performing auxiliary spells like these wouldn’t easily expose his true cultivation level.  

Though they were just fragments, for someone as poor as Chu Ning, it was still tempting.  

Keeping these thoughts to himself, he continued exploring the market with the other two, even visiting the grand shops of the Qingxi Sect and Yunhai Pavilion at the center.  

After about half an hour, Chu Ning suddenly slapped his forehead.  

"Ah! I just remembered—a senior asked me to handle something earlier. You two go ahead, I’ll catch up later."  

Qiu Shunyi and Lü Xingyuan were slightly surprised but didn’t press further, agreeing to meet at the market entrance in an hour.  

Knowing his task might take unpredictable time and that he could move faster than them, Chu Ning added, "If I’m not back in an hour, don’t wait for me—I’ll catch up."  

The two, aware of Chu Ning’s "second-level Qi Refining" speed, nodded in agreement.  

After parting ways, Chu Ning turned down a side street and soon arrived at the shop advertising the Spiritbreath Grass job.  

Inside, a middle-aged man in plain robes with a neatly trimmed beard greeted him with a merchant’s welcoming smile.  

Sensing the man’s cultivation—around the second level of Qi Refining—Chu Ning discreetly adjusted his aura to the third level.  

He knew a second-level disciple might not be taken seriously for such tasks, but third-level disciples were more credible.  

The shopkeeper, unable to gauge Chu Ning’s exact level due to his adjusted aura, smiled even more warmly.  

"Welcome, honored guest! How may I assist you? I’m Shopkeeper Song."  

Without preamble, Chu Ning pointed at the notice outside.  

"Shopkeeper, I saw your request—Spiritbreath Grass needs growth acceleration?"  

"Indeed!" Shopkeeper Song’s eyes brightened. "Are you skilled in the Growth Spell?"  

Chu Ning nodded slightly. "I can cast it instantly. If that’s the requirement, I can do it."  

The shopkeeper immediately retrieved an Ironvine seed and handed it to Chu Ning.  

"Here’s an Ironvine seed. Could you demonstrate first?"  

Chu Ning almost laughed—he was all too familiar with Ironvine.  

But it made sense—it was a common plant, perfect for testing.  

Instead of taking the seed, he simply channeled his spiritual energy and cast the Growth Spell instantly.  

The seed sprouted a thin green vine—the early stage of Ironvine growth.  

With that done, Chu Ning met Shopkeeper Song’s gaze.  

"Shall we discuss payment now?"
