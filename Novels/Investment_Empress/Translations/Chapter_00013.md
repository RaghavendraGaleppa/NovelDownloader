# Chapter 13: A New Investment Target, This Damn Sense of Security

"The Liuhe Fist emphasizes qi permeating the six directions and intent reaching the eight directions."

"Power originates from the ground; once mastered, your eyes will guide your hands."

Xiao Qin meticulously demonstrated the fist techniques, simultaneously explaining the core principles of the martial art. His explanations were remarkably clear and easy to understand.

While observing, Li Mo couldn't help but feel a little curious. This Senior Brother Xiao's proficiency in Liuhe Fist was excellent, far beyond the standard of an outer disciple.

Before long, Li Mo had roughly grasped the basics.

"Senior Brother, what is your name?"

"Xiao Qin."

Xiao? Li Mo inexplicably associated this surname with the words 'extraordinary' written all over it. He couldn't help but activate his Heavenly Mandate Divine Eye to appraise the other party.

**[Name: Xiao Qin]**
**[Age: 18]**
**[Bone Root: None.]**
**[Realm: Just entered Blood Qi Realm.]**
**[Heavenly Mandate: Purple]**
**[Evaluation: Though of ordinary bone root, his comprehension is exceptional, and his character resilient. Outwardly a rough stone, but inwardly concealing a beautiful jade, he will achieve great things later in life and carve out his own domain.]**
**[Recent Encounter: Carries the Seven Stars Ancient Jade, a rare treasure of ancient origins. This treasure requires a massive influx of blood qi to activate, causing Xiao Qin's realm to continuously drop from the tenth meridian of the Blood Qi Realm.]**

...

After reading this, Li Mo was stunned for a moment. Senior Brother Xiao Qin actually possessed a purple heavenly mandate! Li Mo truly hadn't expected it. After all, the other party was an outer disciple and didn't appear to have any special characteristics. If not for his good fist techniques and the surname that caught his attention, he might have overlooked him.

Alright, he thought, from now on, he might as well just collect investment targets by surname. He'd round up all the 'Xiao's and 'Ye's and 'pluck' them first. This also indirectly proved something: having an excellent heavenly mandate didn't necessarily mean a smooth life. One might still encounter various setbacks and tribulations. If one overcame them independently, the heavenly mandate might strengthen. If not, it could weaken or even disappear.

As Li Mo's thoughts churned, Xiao Qin's brows suddenly furrowed. He glanced at Wang Hu not far away and said, "Junior Brother Li Mo, if you have a conflict with Wang Hu, you should leave early."

"Oh? Why do you say that?" Li Mo was puzzled.

"The sect's Martial Arts Training Hall has another rule," Xiao Qin's expression wasn't very pleasant. "Disciples can challenge each other to spar, and the challenged party cannot refuse."

"What kind of rule is that? Aren't they afraid of injuring people?" Li Mo raised an eyebrow. Did this mean Wang Hu would deliberately come to challenge him later?

"With that Deacon Senior Brother watching, it won't lead to serious consequences. At most, a minor injury or some hardship," Xiao Qin shook his head and sighed. From his tone, it seemed he had suffered such losses often.

Li Mo mused. He could understand such a rule. The sect didn't need disciples who only talked theory. Rather than suffering losses or even dying in the outside world, it was better to have a 'preschool class' among their own people first. So, encouraging martial combat was understandable, as long as no one was crippled or killed, it wasn't considered a big deal.

"Well, if you want to learn fist techniques, you can still find me tomorrow. For today, just head back first."

"No need, what's there to be afraid of?" Li Mo still wore a light smile, seemingly unconcerned about the matter.

Xiao Qin frowned. Was Junior Brother Li assuming that as a true disciple, Wang Hu wouldn't dare to truly lay hands on him?

Just then, not far away, Wang Hu rubbed his hands together. "You, come here and fight me." He shoved an outer disciple forward.

The outer disciple gritted his teeth and accepted the challenge. However, it was only his first day learning fist techniques, and he had only barely learned the stances. His punches weren't much different from wild flailing.

"So soft, didn't you eat enough?" Wang Hu sneered. He swiftly parried the opponent's punch, then kicked at the back of his knee, scattering his not-so-firm stance.

*Plop!*

The outer disciple couldn't stand firm and was kicked to his knees.

On the stage, He Hongfeng frowned slightly. Sparring was sparring, and using some tactics to win was acceptable. But Wang Hu's fist techniques were clearly far superior to his opponent's; he was clearly deliberately humiliating him. However, he glanced at Wang Hao and ultimately said nothing.

"You..."

"Hm? You're not convinced? If not, let's continue!"

"Con... convinced..."

"If you're trash, then practice more. Get lost."

Wang Hu stretched his neck, bones cracking. He turned his head. "Hmph, I forgot there's a noble true disciple here. Come on, let me see what makes a true disciple so strong."

He swaggered over menacingly, bumping aside a few outer disciples in his path.

Li Mo: "..."

He looked menacing, but Li Mo felt not a hint of panic. After all, he could add martial arts insights to his Liuhe Fist at any moment. How many years would be good to add? If he dumped twenty years into it all at once, would he be unable to hold back and accidentally kill the guy?

Just then—

*Whoosh!*

A tree branch, imbued with a chilly aura, cut through the air. Wang Hu's face instantly blanched, and he immediately dodged without thinking.

However, he was still too slow. The branch grazed his neck, instantly drawing blood! This was no ordinary tree branch; it was like a sharp sword!

Everyone swallowed, feeling a prickling sensation on their backs even from a distance. They all turned their gazes towards the entrance.

At the entrance, Ying Bing stood, her face like frost, her expression serene. Clearly, that sword-like strike had come from her hand. A single strike, with a mere tree branch she'd casually picked up and thrown, had injured Wang Hu so severely?

Li Mo: "!"

What was with this damn sense of security?

"She... she's trying to kill me." Wang Hu's face was ashen, his voice trembling.

Wang Hao's heart trembled as he gazed at the stunning figure, a flash of possessiveness in his eyes. On her first day, she had already cultivated a superior sword art to initial proficiency? High talent, excellent comprehension, exquisite beauty, and even such a spirited personality.

But Wang Hu was still wailing miserably. Wang Hao then solemnly questioned, "Junior Sister Ying Bing, how can you casually kill a fellow disciple? You'd best give me an explanation."

He was ignored.

"Why are you here?" Li Mo asked, a little surprised.

"Passing by on my way to the Scripture Pavilion." Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed for a moment, then relaxed. She seemed to understand why Li Mo was at the Martial Arts Training Hall.

"Opened your meridians?"

"Mm, just not like you, I also learned a sword art." Li Mo was curious and astonished. That strike just now definitely wasn't the work of a beginner. Nor could it be executed right after opening one's meridians; that ice block had opened at least one more main meridian. Goodness, a red heavenly mandate was truly terrifying. It was almost on par with his own cheat.

"Return to Autumn Water Pavilion." Ying Bing's vermilion lips parted lightly. Without waiting for Li Mo to respond, she turned and walked out the door.

"Mm." Li Mo glanced at the still dazed Xiao Qin, deciding there was no rush. The person wasn't going to run away; investing tomorrow would be the same.

The two spoke as if no one else was present. Not far away, Wang Hao's face had grown so dark it looked like it could drip water. "Junior Sister Ying Bing, you nearly killed my cousin just now! Even if you are a true disciple, you cannot act so recklessly!"

Ying Bing paused. As if finding this 'fly' a bit annoying, she slightly turned her head, her voice, like jade falling to the ground, rang out, "I never 'nearly' kill."

With that, she walked out the door. None of the outer disciples along her path dared to meet her gaze.

Li Mo: "!"

Yes, exactly, that's the vibe.

"You..." Wang Hao was instantly choked, his gloomy expression changing several times. Her words, which brooked no argument, actually made a sense of conviction rise in his heart.

"Senior Brother He, are you just going to stand there and watch?"

"Junior Sister Ying didn't violate any rules, and your cousin is wailing with full vigor; he doesn't seem seriously injured at all," He Hongfeng said with a chuckle. Did Wang Hao think he was an idiot? Even if Junior Sister Ying tore down the Martial Arts Training Hall, he'd still have to cover for her.

"Stop f***ing wailing, she's already gone," Wang Hao, feeling inexplicably terrible, kicked Wang Hu in the backside.

Only then did Wang Hu react. He merely had a bloody gash on his neck. It looked terrifying, but it wasn't actually a big deal. However, he had truly felt as though his head was about to be separated from his body, brushing past death itself!

"Li Mo, you coward! Still needing a woman to protect you!"

"Dare to come to the Martial Arts Training Hall again, and I'll make you pay! She can't protect you every day!" Wang Hu angrily yelled at the outside.

Suddenly, he noticed Xiao Qin in the corner, shaking his head and chuckling.

"You good-for-nothing dare laugh at me? Was it you who taught Li Mo fist techniques just now?" Wang Hu instantly exploded. "Since you're such a good teacher, come on, let me ask you for some pointers too."

Xiao Qin narrowed his eyes, standing ready for battle. He, unlike Junior Brother Li, didn't have such good luck. He could only rely on himself.
