# Chapter 184: Nianjun Speaks Frankly and Faces Disdain

The city of Fu was a prosperous hub where seven rivers converged. It was now mid-October, and the temperature had turned bitterly cold, with the first snowflakes beginning to drift from the sky. Winter arrived early in Fu City, and pedestrians on the streets were already wearing thick padded jackets.

Leaving Zhenxiang Tower, a cold wind whipped about them. It was past noon, and the sun was hidden behind clouds, making the chill even more biting. Li Xian noticed that Hong Chengbing and the other two were shivering, not dressed warmly enough. He gave each of them ten taels of silver, telling them to buy thick jackets before the snow truly set in.

The three were immensely grateful.

They walked back toward the government estate. Soon, Li Xiaofan saw Gu Nianjun and called out to her loudly.

Gu Nianjun, with her graceful demeanor, walked over slowly and said, "Little Brother Xiaofan."

Li Xiaofan hurried over. "Sister Gu, what brings you here? Did you come to eat as well?"

He turned to the side and introduced, "This is my elder brother, Li Xian."

"Li Xian?" Gu Nianjun looked over, a hint of surprise in her eyes. She gave a slight nod but did not offer a greeting. Instead, she said, "Little Brother Xiaofan, your master is calling for you."

"My master is calling for me?" Li Xiaofan was taken aback.

The group headed back together, winding through several main streets until they reached the entrance of the estate. Li Xiaofan said, "Brother, why don't you come with me to meet my master?"

Li Xian knew that Xiaofan's master, "Fu Haoran," was an extremely formidable figure, one whom even the Madam had to treat with great respect. He thought to himself, "Such a person is not someone I can curry favor with at my current level. Under normal circumstances, I would be unwilling to meet him, as it would bring too much trouble. But since Xiaofan is my brother, if I could meet him once, I could better understand Xiaofan's life here."

He said frankly, "Alright."

Li Xiaofan was overjoyed. Gu Nianjun said, "Little Brother Xiaofan, your master is calling for you, likely to discuss something important. It would be somewhat inappropriate for your brother to go as well."

"Why don't you go see Master Haoran first? I can keep your brother company and walk him around the estate."

"Ah!" Li Xiaofan was delighted. He winked at Li Xian and laughed, "Alright, I'll trouble Sister Gu to walk with my brother."

"You two must take a good walk."

With that, he ran into the estate with Hong Chengbing, Liu Shu, and Lu Xuan, turning several corners and disappearing from sight.

Deep within the estate.

A three-story pavilion stood before a courtyard planted with purple bamboo. The plaque bore the three characters "Haoran Pavilion," the calligraphy bold and clear.

It was evident that the calligrapher had profound mastery of the literary arts and was an upright, heaven-defying individual.

Fu Haoran, a "Heavenly Official Descending to Earth," was watering the flowers in the courtyard. Hearing footsteps, he knew Xiaofan had returned and said, "Xiaofan, you're back?"

"Master," Li Xiaofan said respectfully, "Did you summon me for something?"

"The scriptures and theories I taught you a couple of days ago, recite them for me once," Fu Haoran said.

"Alright." Li Xiaofan had a photographic memory and an excellent one at that. He recited them flawlessly, even understanding the difficult parts thoroughly. Fu Haoran nodded, his eyes filled with satisfaction and hidden affection. He stroked his beard and said, "Good, good, my good child, you are truly excellent."

"Thank you for the praise, Master," Li Xiaofan said happily.

"You just left the estate; was it your brother who came to find you?" Fu Haoran asked.

Li Xiaofan picked up a watering can and skillfully helped water the flowers. "Yes, my brother came specifically to see me. I was just about to introduce him to you, Master."

"No need," Fu Haoran said. "Xiaofan, I spoke to you before about the scholarly tour. Are you prepared?"

"The scholarly tour..." Li Xiaofan's eyes lit up. "We scholars must see the world and meet all kinds of people. But isn't the tour supposed to be after the New Year?"

"It's been moved up. It's this afternoon," Fu Haoran said.

"Huh!" Li Xiaofan was shocked. "But my brother just got here. Master, I need to go see my brother." He dropped the watering can and rushed out in a hurry. Fu Haoran picked up the watering can, brushed off the dirt, and smiled. "This child."

Not long after, Li Xiaofan walked back dejectedly. His brother was gone, his eyes slightly red. They had难得 met, yet they couldn't even say a proper goodbye.

Fu Haoran walked over and said earnestly, "Xiaofan, the scholarly tour is for tempering your heart. Knowledge from books is ultimately superficial. Only by truly walking the world can you integrate and master what you have learned. I possess a noble spirit but have nowhere to apply it. You have an boundless future and no ties, so you can go further."

Meanwhile, on the other side.

Gu Nianjun's smile had vanished. "Brother Li, please come with me. Let's take a walk around the estate."

She walked ahead. Li Xian followed, taking several quick steps but unable to catch up. He discovered that whether he sped up or slowed down, Gu Nianjun was always half a step ahead of him.

Li Xian guessed that there were many students in the estate, and walking side-by-side with a woman could easily lead to misunderstandings. It was perfectly normal for Gu Nianjun to have such a concern, so he stopped trying to catch up and slowed his pace.

Observing her steps, they were elegant and unhurried, yet she was always a step ahead. He couldn't figure out the reason and couldn't help but marvel, "Fu City truly hides dragons and tigers. This woman is just walking normally, yet she conceals an extremely superior lightness skill. With such a lightness technique, even if I went all out, I probably couldn't catch up."

"Xiaofan said she comes from a great background, it seems it's not a lie. That kid is small but sly, he really wants to help me find a wife."

After walking for a while, they went deeper into the estate. Li Xian said, "Xiaofan told me that since he came to the estate, he has been grateful for Miss Gu's care. On behalf of Xiaofan, I'd like to thank you sincerely."

Gu Nianjun, with her graceful demeanor, walked with her hair swaying gently. She said softly, "Xiaofan is naturally intelligent, can seize fortune, and has a sincere heart. He is thirsty for knowledge, occasionally comes to ask for advice, and is very polite. How could I not teach him?"

"It puts my mind at ease to see that Xiaofan has such good teachers and friends like you," Li Xian said with a smile. His steps gradually slowed as he looked at the green willows and lake in the estate.

Li Xian suddenly asked, "Miss Gu, you seem to dislike me?"

"We've just met, how can you talk about like or dislike?" Gu Nianjun said indifferently.

They came to a long corridor where there were fewer pedestrians. Trees towered on both sides, and flower beds were in full bloom, their fragrance filling the air. Gu Nianjun added, "When Little Brother Xiaofan asks me about scholarship, he always mentions you."

"Meeting you for the first time today, however, it's different from what I imagined."

"Oh?" Li Xian asked, "How so?"

"From Xiaofan's descriptions, your nature is simple and honest, similar to Xiaofan's temperament, with a sincere heart. Even if you don't have Xiaofan's kind of talent, you are still a very good person," Gu Nianjun said, turning her head.

Li Xian smiled. "So I have disappointed Miss Gu?"

"I said earlier, since we've just met, how can there be disappointment?" Gu Nianjun shook her head. "Xiaofan is still young and doesn't know that people change. Even brothers from the same womb can have one who does evil and another who does good. He has been cultivating in the estate for a year, and you have been experiencing the world for a year. The things you've experienced and the people you've seen are different. It's only natural for you to have changed."

Her words carried a hidden criticism. She first said Li Xian was sincere and simple, then said he had changed. This meant Li Xian was no longer sincere or simple, and was far different from Li Xiaofan.

Li Xian understood this naturally.

Gu Nianjun said, "Your name is Li Xian, so it was you who injured Wan Run?"

"You know about that too?" Li Xian asked.

"The estate's studies encompass heaven and man, with a wide variety of subjects: statecraft, music, chess, calligraphy, painting, poetry, songs, medicine, divination... all are covered. Wan Run was severely injured, fell to the ground unconscious, his flesh packed with shards of porcelain, his injuries were terrifying. He was soon sent to the estate by the common folk. Those in the estate skilled in medicine treated his injuries, promoting the spirit of healing."

"That's how I found out," Gu Nianjun said.

Li Xian understood. "So that's how it was."

Gu Nianjun asked, "But it was just a verbal dispute, why did you have to injure him so severely? Your methods were so ruthless. Aren't you afraid that one day, someone will use the same ruthless methods on you?"

Li Xian was open and aboveboard. He knew Gu Nianjun disliked him and already had a prejudice against him, but his tone remained calm, without explanation or defense. "Since you think my methods are ruthless, then what is your purpose in specifically walking with me, Miss Gu?"

Gu Nianjun said, "Ruthless methods, the name Li Xian. And you have the strength to severely injure Wan Run, so you are the 'Evil Lieutenant' of Qingning?"

"Correct," Li Xian asked. "Miss Gu, do you also believe those rumors? Is it because of those rumors that you have a prejudice against me?"

"Whether I believe them or not, what does it matter?" Gu Nianjun shook her head and smiled. "I'm not interested in your affairs. Whether your methods are ruthless or you bully the world, I don't care. I specifically walked with you, it's just for Xiaofan's sake."

"Xiaofan has great ambition, talent, and character. He was born of humble origins and was ostracized in the estate. Both Master Haoran and I saw this. We didn't offer help to test his character and temper his conduct. All along, he has done very well. Though young, his will is firm and his aspirations are distant; he has never wavered."

"Such a sincere heart is easily tainted. Ordinary people or matters naturally cannot affect him, but those close to him are the most likely to pollute this rare, pure heart."

"Because of Little Brother Xiaofan, I have investigated you. Whether the rumors in the market are true or false, it doesn't matter. We have no friendship, but there is no doubt that you are entangled in a web of grievances and disputes."

"Moreover, you were ruthless in your actions just now. This shows that even if the rumors are not entirely true, they are not entirely false. You and Xiaofan are biological brothers. Precisely because of this, you are not suitable to have further contact with Xiaofan."

Having said this, she had made her point clearly.

Li Xian frowned, thinking, "This woman is arrogant, looks down on me, but is very optimistic about Xiaofan." He said calmly, "Miss Gu, I am very happy that you and the others care for Xiaofan. But you seem to be underestimating me."

"I do have many entanglements, but I will never involve Xiaofan."

Gu Nianjun said, "What you do, I don't care. But I've made myself clear. If you are unhappy, whether you are angry or furious, it's fine if you want to fight me."

"Goodbye!" Li Xian didn't want to say more.

Gu Nianjun said, "There is one more thing you need to be clear about. You came to this city of Fu, and many entanglements and undercurrents are surging. Master Haoran is already aware of this and plans to take Xiaofan away from this situation, to leave the city and travel for scholarly pursuits, teaching him the ways of the world."

"If fate is unkind today, the mountains are high and the waters are long. This may be the last time you two brothers meet."

Li Xian stopped and said coldly, "You are doing this for Xiaofan's good, taking him on a scholarly tour. If Xiaofan is willing, I will never object. But why deceive him and add obstacles to a proper farewell?"

Gu Nianjun remained silent.

Li Xian was angry that Gu Nianjun was acting on her own initiative and looking down on him. Though her words were not explicit, they carried a sense of vigilance and caution, as if he would take the opportunity to攀附(climb up to) Xiaofan and Fu Haoran if given the chance.

However, on second thought, this trip to Fu City was bound to be turbulent. It was an excellent place for Xiaofan to leave the city. He had a plan in mind and did not show his emotions. He said, "Miss Gu, you said a lot to me just now. In the end, it boils down to one thing: you look down on me, Li Xian."

"So what?" Gu Nianjun said proudly. "Do you expect me to think highly of you?"

"If you were a true hero, I would surely look at you with new eyes in the future. But right now, you are stuck in a quagmire, unable to even take care of yourself."

Li Xian smiled and said frankly, "It's fine. Even though you look down on me, I still want to thank you on Xiaofan's behalf. What happened today ends here. Farewell!"

He turned and left, free and easy, magnanimous.

Gu Nianjun was stunned, a look of surprise on her face.
