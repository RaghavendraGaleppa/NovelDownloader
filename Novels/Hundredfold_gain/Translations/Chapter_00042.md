# Chapter 42: Ye Liang's Test and Reaction

In the southeastern part of the inner sect, atop a towering spiritual peak, thin mist swirled as the dim sunlight filtered through the clouds. At the summit stood a mid-grade first-tier cave dwelling.

At the entrance of the cave, Ye Liang stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his luxurious robes fluttering in the breeze. A strand of black hair danced before his forehead, exuding an undeniable aura of authority. His noble features were adorned with a gentle smile as he gazed into the distance.

The height of his spiritual peak and the elevation of his cave dwelling afforded him a broad view. From the entrance, he could faintly make out numerous other inner sect peaks stretching into the distance. This was why he had initially been pleased with the location when he had drawn this cave dwelling by lot.

"That direction... must be where Qi Chuan's cave dwelling is located," Ye Liang mused with a faint smile, his eyes settling on a barely visible peak to his left. That was the site of Qi Chuan's high-grade first-tier cave dwelling. Though it was of higher grade, the peak itself was actually shorter than Ye Liang's mid-grade dwelling.

When he had first entered the inner sect, Ye Liang hadn't known much about Qi Chuan, only that he was a proud scion of the Qi family who had lucked out in drawing a high-grade first-tier cave dwelling. However, he had later discreetly tasked the Ye family with investigating the family disciples and rogue cultivators who had entered the inner sect in the same batch. Through this, he had gathered some information about his fellow new inner sect disciples.

Though Qi Chuan, the lucky one, was relatively well-protected by the Qi family, making the information Ye Liang obtained somewhat limited, he had still managed to learn that the boy might be a spellcasting prodigy. According to the Ye family's investigation, Qi Chuan's Fireball Technique had likely reached the minor mastery level—perhaps even major mastery. 

However, Ye Liang believed it couldn't be major mastery; minor mastery was more plausible. After all, the boy was only about fourteen years old—two years younger than himself. How could he possibly have achieved major mastery in the Fireball Technique? Still, even minor mastery marked him as a genuine spellcasting prodigy. 

Moreover, Qi Chuan's cultivation wasn't weak either. At fourteen, he was already at the fourth level of Qi Refining. Combined with his spellcasting talent, this piqued Ye Liang's interest. 

With his birthday banquet just three days away, an idea struck him. He would invite Qi Chuan and use the occasion to test the true level of the boy's Fireball Technique. 

Of course, Qi Chuan wasn't the only one. This time, he had only invited those among the new inner sect disciples—those from the same intake—whom the Ye family's investigations had identified as having promising talent and potential, making them worthy of recruitment.

Though his ultimate goal was to become a core disciple and, eventually, a Foundation Establishment elder of the Moon Breeze Sect, he would remain an inner sect disciple for some time before that. During this period, having these promising new disciples work for him would be ideal, allowing him to focus more on his cultivation. 

Take Qi Chuan, for example. The boy had been fortunate enough to draw a high-grade first-tier cave dwelling. If Ye Liang could devise a way to exchange it for his own—whether through resources or promises—it would undoubtedly greatly benefit his cultivation.

"This time, I'm sending the invitation personally. Surely Qi Chuan won't refuse?" Ye Liang gazed ahead, a warm smile playing on his lips. 

By all reasoning, refusal seemed unlikely. After all, he was a member of the Ye family—a clan widely regarded as the foremost beneath the Moon Breeze Sect. As the sole Ye family member selected for the inner sect, his cultivation talent and current realm made him the undisputed top among the new inner sect disciples of his batch. 

For someone of his standing to lower himself and personally invite Qi Chuan to his birthday banquet was already a tremendous show of respect. Whether out of a desire to curry favor or fear of offending him, Qi Chuan surely wouldn't dare refuse. 

And once the boy attended, Ye Liang had various means to test the true level of his Fireball Technique. 

If it was indeed at the minor mastery level, Qi Chuan would hold greater value for recruitment compared to other new disciples. But if it was major mastery... that would pose a threat. The boy might even become a rival in the competition for core disciple status. 

If the latter proved true, learning it early would allow Ye Liang to prepare countermeasures in advance...

*Flap! Flap!*

Just then, the sound of fluttering wings broke the silence. 

A paper crane struggled through the thin mist, ascending from below. 

Seeing this, Ye Liang smiled faintly and extended his hand, allowing the crane to alight on his palm. He unfolded it and read Qi Chuan's reply on the back.

*"My apologies, Brother Ye. I’ve been extremely busy lately and truly cannot free myself to attend in three days. Nevertheless, I wish you a happy birthday."*

*"...Qi Chuan."*

As his eyes traced the words, the warmth in Ye Liang's smile gradually froze. 

"Hmph. This Qi Chuan has quite the nerve!" 

*Whoosh!* 

Crushing the letter into a ball, flames erupted from his palm. In an instant, the paper turned to ash, slipping through his fingers. 

Ye Liang's gaze shifted back toward the direction of Qi Chuan's high-grade first-tier cave dwelling. A shadow of anger flickered deep in his pupils. 

He truly hadn't expected the boy to dare refuse. 

He had assumed that even if Qi Chuan wasn't interested in being recruited, he would at least attend the banquet out of courtesy. 

To think...

"Never mind. He’s just a minor talent in spellcasting..." 

Ye Liang chuckled softly and shook his head, a trace of disdain flashing in his eyes. 

In his estimation, there was a ninety-nine percent chance Qi Chuan's Fireball Technique was only at the minor mastery level—certainly not major mastery. 

If it was just minor mastery, then in Ye Liang's eyes, the boy was merely somewhat gifted—nothing extraordinary. 

After all, in the world of cultivation, what truly mattered was one's realm of cultivation. 

Even if Qi Chuan mastered the Fireball Technique to perfection, it would only be formidable within the Qi Refining stage. What use would it be against a Foundation Establishment expert? 

If the boy thought himself special just because of a minor spellcasting talent, it would be nothing short of laughable. 

"Better to focus on preparing to recruit the other promising new disciples who will attend in three days. At least some of them will agree." 

Cold light flickering in his eyes, Ye Liang flicked his sleeves and turned back into his mid-grade first-tier cave dwelling. Behind him, the glow of formation runes flared, and with a heavy *boom*, the door slammed shut. 

From within the cave, a faint chuckle could be heard. 

"As for this Qi Chuan... well, there will be time to deal with him later..."
