Chapter 87: Palm Thunder

A loud cracking sound echoed through the air as a massive black rock in front of Lin Xuan suddenly developed deep cracks, and small rocks began to fall off. The atmosphere grew thick with dark energy, and a black light burst out from the rock, disrupting Lin Xuan's hand seals.

The young man's expression turned grim as the cacophony of terrifying sounds grew louder, a mix of dying screams, beast roars, and other eerie noises that sent shivers down the spine. The sky darkened, and a thick, black fog emerged from the rock, filled with ghostly apparitions and a malevolent aura that seemed to drive one mad.

Even the resentful energy within the Hundred Souls Banner couldn't compare to the intensity of the negative emotions emanating from this place. Lin Xuan's expression turned serious as he realized that the guardian of the spiritual herb wasn't a beast, but a malevolent ghost or evil spirit.

The air was heavy with the weight of countless cultivators who had fallen here over the years, their resentful energy lingering and eventually forming into powerful malevolent entities. Lin Xuan recalled the legends he had read about such occurrences, where cultivators and beasts fought over spiritual herbs, leading to their downfall. Some reincarnated, while others remained, their souls trapped, and eventually became malevolent ghosts, guarding the herbs and preventing others from taking them.

The ghostly apparitions emerging from the fog were the accumulated souls of cultivators and beasts that had perished here over the centuries. Lin Xuan's lips curled into a wry smile as he realized that he couldn't bypass this challenge. To harvest the herb, he needed to eliminate the malevolent entities.

Lin Xuan retrieved a talisman from his robes, infused it with his energy, and ignited it, releasing a golden light that bore the characters "Po Xie" (Break Evil). The talisman proved effective against the ghostly entities, and two of them dissipated into nothingness. However, this was only a small fraction of the malevolent energy present.

As Lin Xuan continued to face the ghostly apparitions, he unsheathed his flying sword, which, imbued with his energy, could cleave through the entities. Meanwhile, the carnage in the Creek Leaping Gorge was nearing its end, with most cultivators having been slaughtered by the Fire Spirit Gate, leaving only a few with the strength and cunning to survive.

Elsewhere, Xiang Wu, a cultivator, sneered at Qin Yan, a young female cultivator, taunting her to surrender her sword and become his concubine. Qin Yan's face flushed with anger and shame, but she knew she couldn't escape Xiang Wu's pursuit, as he was skilled in tracking techniques.

As the battle between Qin Yan and Xiang Wu intensified, Qin Yan realized that she couldn't outlast him and decided to use her last resort – a blue pearl that contained a powerful spell. Xiang Wu, confident in his superiority, didn't notice the pearl until it was too late.

The pearl released a brilliant blue light, accompanied by crackling thunderbolts, which Xiang Wu recognized as the "Palm Thunder" spell, a high-level technique typically mastered by cultivators above the Foundation Establishment stage. The intensity of the spell's energy made Xiang Wu suspect that the cultivator who had sealed the Palm Thunder was likely at the Nascent Soul stage.

The blue lightning bolt struck Xiang Wu's transformed gold ring knife, now in the shape of a giant serpent, and sent it tumbling to the ground, revealing its true form. Xiang Wu was now certain that the pearl contained a Nascent Soul stage cultivator's Palm Thunder.
