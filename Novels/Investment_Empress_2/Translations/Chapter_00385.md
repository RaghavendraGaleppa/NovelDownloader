# Chapter 385: Shopping with the Ice Cube and the Young Mistress's Special Skill!

The streets were bustling, and Li Mo noticed that even the martial artists from Qinghe County had grown in number. The group ahead were clearly swordsmen from Yunzhou. Each carried a long sword, their white robes fluttering, yet they shivered like quails in the heavy snow. Still, it didn't stop them from thinking they looked dashing.

Internal energy practitioners could easily dispel the cold by circulating their Qi, but who would be so foolish as to keep their Qi flowing constantly for twelve whole hours? Unless, of course, they were like Li Mo, possessing seven Xuan Pills.

"Li... Brother Li?"

Li Mo was just wondering if the special effects lately had been a bit too over-the-top when a familiar voice called out to him. It was none other than the famous Hengyun Three Heroes: Wu Chushu, Cao Mu, and Bai Jinghong.

"What are you guys doing here?" Li Mo asked.

"Aren't you heading to the Broken Axe Mountain to investigate as well?" Wu Chushu replied. "A few days ago, ten thousand swords filled the sky. It was earth-shattering. The spectacle was absolutely magnificent."

"The 'Ten Thousand Swords Filling the Sky' was indeed impressive, but it's a bit overused," Li Mo said, nodding. "Personally, I prefer today's 'Heavenly Furnace Refining the Sun.'"

Li Mo nodded, giving his recent work a small evaluation.

Cao Mu: "?"
Wu Chushu: "??"
Bai Jinghong: "....."

How did he know the details so clearly? He even knew exactly what kind of celestial phenomenon occurred today.

Seeing the strange expressions on their faces, Li Mo coughed lightly.

"The New Year is coming soon. Are you still heading to Broken Axe Mountain?"

Bai Jinghong shook his head, maintaining his aloof swordmaster demeanor. "Brother Li, surely you aren't idle this New Year either?"

Li Mo and Ying Bing, who once hadn't even made it onto the Hidden Dragon Ranking, were now both ranked in the top five! Which genius at the top of the ranking wouldn't want to fight for the number one spot?

But the top spot belonged to the Crown Prince of the Great Yu Dynasty, Jiang Yu. His talent was exceptional; the world said he was comparable to his ancestor, Emperor Wu. He enjoyed the best resources from the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, backed by an entire dynasty. He stood high at the top, like an insurmountable chasm.

To surpass him, talent and hard work went without saying, but one would also need a heaven-defying opportunity.

The legacy of Broken Axe Mountain, in the eyes of many, had become that heaven-defying opportunity.

"I am quite busy," Li Mo said, looking up at the forty-five-degree angle, his face as cold and aloof as an ice cube.

Well, at night he had to cultivate with the Ice Cube, discuss what special effects to use tomorrow, and teach the little Princess Jiang. During the day, he had to ride the Somersault Cloud to Broken Axe Mountain to add special effects. With the New Year approaching, he also had to go to the southern border to maintain the collective faith of the various tribes.

He was either showing off his divinity or on his way to show it off. Young Master Li was a little exhausted.

Wu Chushu looked serious. "It seems Brother Li has already made ample preparations."

"Of course," Li Mo said matter-of-factly. "Otherwise, how could I spend the New Year in peace?"

Suddenly, Li Mo felt something was off.

*Hmm?*

Where was my Ice Cube? I was holding her hand just a moment ago. How did she disappear in the blink of an eye?

Li Mo looked up to search for her and noticed that Bai Jinghong and the others were staring at something behind him with expressions as if they had seen a ghost. It wasn't some evil spirit, was it?

Young Master Li's heart tightened, and he turned around, his expression freezing.

Dressed in a red dress, Ying Bing was holding a tiger's head. To be precise, it was a tiger-head hat, the kind a child might wear, looking incredibly cute. Her cold and distant face, paired with the new red dress, made her even more stunning. She seriously pinched the tiger-head hat.

"Li Mo, is this one good-looking?"

"There are no children in our house."

"Do you like it?" Ying Bing hugged the tiger-head hat, her voice soft.

Li Mo was speechless. "I... I wouldn't even be able to fit it on."

So Ying Bing took the tiger-head hat and put it on his head. Surprisingly, it actually fit.

And so, the handsome Young Master Li acquired a New Year's skin: *Divine Hammer Little Tyrant - Tiger-Head Hat Limited Edition.*

Li Mo: "....."

He couldn't even imagine what his introduction on the next Hidden Dragon Ranking would become if the people from the Heavenly Panning Sect saw this.

"Ten taels of silver, it's not expensive..." Ying Bing tugged on the tiger whiskers on his head, straightening the hat for him, and murmured.

---

"Ten taels?"

"Ten taels."

"This hat is only worth ten taels if it's made of a real tiger's head. Which stall is this? Even if you were selling it to a celestial fairy, you wouldn't rip them off like that. Let's go, I'll back you up."

Did they think the Little Tyrant of Qinghe County was just for show?

Li Mo took two steps.

Then he turned back, took the hand of the cold and elegant Ice Cube, waved goodbye to the Hengyun Three Heroes, and turned to leave.

Ying Bing looked at the three of them, finding them somewhat familiar. She wanted to greet them, but she couldn't remember their names at all.

So it turned into a cold glance, followed by a magnificent turn and departure...

"....."

Bai Jinghong, Wu Chushu, and Cao Mu fell into deep thought, feeling that everything happening before them was a bit surreal.

After a moment of silence.

Cao Mu, holding his sword, said, "Li Mo and Ying Bing must have made many preparations for the opportunity at Broken Axe Mountain. What we're seeing is probably just the surface."

"Exactly. Behind the scenes, they might have prepared some secret technique to seize the opportunity in one go," Bai Jinghong said. He himself often secretly practiced his swordsmanship and then told Wu Chushu and Cao Mu that he was listening to songs at the pleasure house to put them at ease. Unfortunately, he was later discovered, because Wu Chushu was actually at the pleasure house every day.

Wu Chushu crossed his arms and squinted at the backs of the two leaving.

It was well known that Li Mo had always overshadowed him in the art of "showing off his divinity," and his deeds in the southern border had spread throughout the world.

He was very curious about how Li Mo and Ying Bing had managed to enter the top five of the Hidden Dragon Ranking together.

"Should we follow them and take a look?"

"Yes. 'Other mountains' stones can polish jade.' It's good to learn from others."

"I'm also curious about how they usually practice to achieve such rapid progress."

With that, the three of them followed. On the bustling and noisy street, it wasn't long before they saw Li Mo and Ying Bing again.

Li Mo was holding Ying Bing's hand and standing in front of a hat stall.

"Ten taels of silver, boss, isn't that a bit too much?"

"Cough, Young Master Li, then how much do you say it is?" The stall owner clearly knew Li Mo and his tone was a bit sheepish.

Li Mo made a gesture of 'eight'.

"Eight taels?"

"Eight *wen*."

"???? Young Master Li, how can you bargain like this!"

The stall owner's eyes went dark, and then his expression became serious. On Li Mo, he saw a figure that made all the small vendors on this street tremble with fear: Gu Xueqin!

And so, the scene inexplicably became intense.

Li Mo and the stall owner began a thrilling, heart-pounding session of haggling.

"....."

A hint of confusion appeared in Ying Bing's clear, deep eyes. Not to mention ten taels of silver, ten taels of gold wouldn't be much to him. But why was he haggling with the intensity of a grandmaster's duel?

"One tael and four mace. If it's cheaper, I'll take two. If not, I'm leaving. I'm really leaving," Young Master Li finally used the 'I'm leaving if you don't sell' technique and successfully won.

He turned back to look at the Ice Cube, raising his chin with a triumphant smile, like a victorious general.

Ying Bing pursed her lips, took a money jar from her big-headed doll bag, and began to count the silver. As she counted, the corners of her cold eyes lifted with a hint of joy.

"So you can bargain like that."

"Of course."

After paying, Li Mo picked up a white-furred cat hat from the stall.

The stall owner grimaced. "The Young Mistress of the Li family is a master at bargaining. I get scared just seeing her come over."

Upon hearing this, Ying Bing's eyes trembled slightly. She looked at Li Mo, who was fiddling with the white cat fur hat.

"Li Mo."

"Hmm?"

"I want to learn that too."
