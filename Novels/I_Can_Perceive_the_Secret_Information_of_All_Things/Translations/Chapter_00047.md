# Chapter 47: Trouble, There's a Taoist

An eagle-man plucked a feather from its body to pick its teeth: "So you'll have to lower the price a bit more."

The speaker was an eagle demon, commonly known in the underworld as the Black Feather Nest Lord. 

It wasn't called that because its feathers were black—but because its heart was black. 

There was no trade this creature wouldn't dare undertake. In recent years, it had frequently traveled between human territories and the western demon lands, specializing in human trafficking. 

The Flying Feather Gang it personally established held significant weight in the trafficking underworld. Even many second- and third-tier demons gave it face because it brought benefits. 

Sometimes, demons were even more pragmatic than humans. 

At this moment, it had brought its elite subordinates to the Second Cave of the Mad Demon Den for a human trade. 

The Flying Feather Gang consisted almost entirely of avian demons—wild ducks, pheasants, pigeons, and the like. 

Now, standing behind the Black Feather Nest Lord were several arrogant bird-men. 

Among them was a crow who wore its clothes unbuttoned, looking particularly cocky. 

Naturally, the Mad Demon Den side wasn't low-key either. Bear King had specifically chosen several bizarre-looking, hulking subordinates to stand behind him. Unfortunately, the lazy demon named Kaola had been assigned to a critical position elsewhere—otherwise, its presence would have blown the Flying Feather Gang away. 

These days, any den with an imported demon could show off a little. 

"Two hundred eighty-six people, all healthy children. Final offer: one hundred yellow-grade spirit stones plus ten Shapeshifting Pills... that's already rock bottom," Bear Demon said, crossing his legs with negotiation flair that matched his counterpart. 

The Black Feather Nest Lord snorted through its nostrils, already calculating how to haggle further. 

A hundred spirit stones per trade was no small sum. 

Of course, such mundane trades couldn't compare to transactions between lofty cultivators. But for a small demon gang established just a few years ago, a hundred spirit stones was already impressive. 

"Eighty. Not a coin more," the Black Feather Nest Lord declared, using its beak to snatch a piece of meat and swallow it whole. 

"Ninety. Final offer," countered Bear King. 

"Eighty," the Nest Lord insisted. 

"Look, my Mad Demon Den has over a hundred brothers to feed," Bear King argued. "You're making this very difficult!" 

It had even counted many low-intelligence demons in that number. 

The standoff seemed to have reached an impasse. 

"Difficult?" The crow behind the Nest Lord suddenly stepped forward and flipped the table. "Then don't bother!" 

The sudden act left both sides stunned. 

"Crow, what are you doing? I wasn't finished eating!" The Nest Lord frowned. "And the timing's all wrong—we were still negotiating! You're supposed to wait for my signal!"

Just as both sides were wondering how to salvage the situation, a pig demon came tumbling in: "My King! Trouble—there's a Taoist outside!"

A Taoist? 

At their trading location? 

"And martial constables too," the pig demon added between gasps. 

Constables too? 

This clearly meant someone had colluded with human authorities. 

"Black and white teaming up, eh?" The Black Feather Nest Lord spat out the feather it had been using to pick its teeth, its eyes turning vicious. 

Its subordinates immediately spread their wings, ready for battle. 

"I should be the one saying that," Bear King growled as his body swelled, the white fur on his chest bristling. "You're the one colluding with human officials, birdbrain." 

Bear King was convinced the Taoist had been brought by the Flying Feather Gang. 

For this trade, it had spent many nights strategizing. 

Choosing the Second Cave as the location, laying false trails around the main mountain den, even stationing imported demons as decoys—all to mislead rival demon dens or human cultivators and buy time for the transaction. 

Once the deal was done, it planned to take the smart brothers, abandon the stupid ones, relocate, and start fresh elsewhere.

At the hidden forest behind the Second Cave of Mad Demon Den stood large fenced enclosures divided into sections. 

Originally temporary holding pens for humans, the area now lay strewn with demon corpses as constables ushered out a continuous stream of captives—men, women, and children. 

One enclosure held only children, which Song Yuanbao was carefully counting. 

"One hundred sixty-seven... two hundred eighty-four, two hundred eighty-five." Song glanced nervously toward the cave entrance and whispered, "Taoist Xiao, I think that's everyone." 

"There's one more. That kid's extremely cautious—crawling out while using obstacles for cover. Have your men find him," Xiao Ji said. 

Song Yuanbao had brought few men—only six including himself. 

Moreover, this operation involved infiltrating demon territory for a rescue. Following Taoist Xiao's plan to eradicate this demon faction entirely had everyone slightly on edge. 

They'd followed the Taoist's winding path, circling around until the main den was in sight—only to abruptly retreat and search another mountain instead. 

Though unclear about the reasoning, the results spoke for themselves: they'd effortlessly located the missing people. Not just the ninety-nine recently abducted from Willow Town, but many more. 

Demons lurking nearby had been pinpointed and silently eliminated one by one, like wooden stakes, without causing the slightest disturbance. 

A ghostly assassin couldn't have done better. 

Then came the even more thrilling rescue. Taoist Xiao had strolled into the enclosures as casually as entering his own home—so brazen even Song, a human constable, thought it overly audacious. 

Didn't take demons seriously at all. 

This was their territory, likely riddled with traps and demonic arrays. 

Yet astonishingly, Xiao Ji seemed to avoid every hidden danger with preternatural awareness. 

Thus they'd easily freed the captives and, per Xiao Ji's instructions, began leading them out in orderly lines. 

Only one demon guard had escaped alive—a pig demon. 

Xiao Ji had watched it flee without pursuit. 

He needed a messenger to alert the den, making the pig demon an unwitting guide that would save him time. 

Rescue first, eradicate second—Xiao Ji's prearranged strategy. With the people safe, only the extermination of Bear King's faction remained. 

The plan for total annihilation was simple: seal the cave. 

Xiao Ji liked sealing caves. 

Simple, effective, and thorough. 

He instructed Song Yuanbao's team to lead the captives back the way they came toward the main road. Song sent his men ahead but chose to stay and assist the Taoist.

Outside the Second Cave's entrance, Xiao Ji stood guard while Song Yuanbao hid nearby. 

[Flying Feather Gang and Mad Demon Den combined forces: 2 first-grade tenth-tier demons, 6 first-grade second-tier, 5 first-grade third-tier, and 28 below first-grade...] 

[Black Feather Nest Lord: first-grade tenth-tier. Weapons: three yellow-grade feather artifacts. Demon art: Molting Eagle Strike.] 

[Bear King: first-grade tenth-tier. Strength-based. Can launch claw nails. Demon art: Mountain Moving Technique.] 

The intel matched what he'd gathered from lesser demons earlier, though more detailed now. 

Mountain Moving Technique had tiers too. At lower levels, one could only move boulders or iron balls. Greater strength allowed shifting small hills. Moving an entire mountain? Impossible for a tenth-tier Qi Refining demon. 

Analyzing the opposition revealed their strongest were the two leaders—mere lackeys before Xiao Ji's Great Perfection Qi Refining cultivation, two whole tiers below him. 

The miscellaneous lesser demons would be easily handled too. 

After reassessing the situation, Xiao Ji turned his thoughts inward. 

"I really should learn more spells. A Taoist on the verge of Foundation Establishment shouldn't just hack away with a sword—it's undignified," he mused about his current limitations. "Next time in Ancient City Tai, I must acquire proper cultivation manuals." 

A melee Taoist worked in the mortal realm, but would struggle in cultivator circles. Those flying adepts in Ancient City Tai, the legendary battles described in texts—what true cultivator fought at close range? 

Xiao Ji knew he possessed the "Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Violet Gold Sword Art," but even sword techniques projecting attacks three thousand miles away still felt like melee combat.

Inside the Second Cave's negotiation hall, both sides were seasoned demons who wouldn't panic over unverified rumors. 

"Well played, Brother Bear," the Black Feather Nest Lord sneered. "Underestimated you—having your lackey interrupt negotiations with scary stories to make me flee so you'd get the goods for free? Clever scheme." 

"You think that one could act?" Bear King gestured at the pig demon's dopey face. "I know my subordinates." 

The pig demon's eyes still bulged with genuine terror—not something it could fake. 

After brief discussion, both sides decided to investigate. 

At the cave mouth, the demons peered out to find the ground littered with their kin's corpses. 

A Taoist sat cross-legged ahead, clearly settling in for the long haul. 

The pig demon spread its hooves. "See? I wasn't lying."
