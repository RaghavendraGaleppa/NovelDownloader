# Chapter 49: The Trail of the Gu King Xin Xuan!

Inside the pavilion, Jia Shifang remained completely unaware that he had been marked by someone, still curious about the earlier conversation between the Buddhist Master and the Young Sect Leader of Kunlun.

"What exactly were you discussing with the Young Sect Leader of Kunlun earlier?" Jia Shifang, straightforward by nature, asked bluntly. "And how is the Gu King Xin Xuan so important that you'd use a sacred artifact from the Arhat Hall as a reward to set up formations across the entire Xuanling Prefecture?"

"This matter does not concern you," the Buddhist Master of the Vajra Temple replied, giving him a deep look. "He is the Young Sect Leader of Kunlun, which is why he was privy to this! As for me, I was only informed after inheriting the title of Buddhist Master!"

After a pause, the Buddhist Master added, "This matter involves the very foundation of the immortal sects and Buddhist temples—it is a closely guarded secret. If you truly wish to know the truth, the only way is to one day seize my position as Buddhist Master!"

"With your unparalleled talent, how could I ever take your place? Unless the Jia family buys the entire Vajra Temple..." Jia Shifang trailed off, lost in thought for a moment before suddenly asking, "How much is the Vajra Temple worth?"

Was this fool actually considering usurping the position of Buddhist Master?

"..."

The Buddhist Master's expression remained unchanged as he said, "First, follow my instructions and bury the prayer beads in various locations across Xuanling Prefecture. If you still wish to challenge me for my position, we can discuss that later."

Jia Shifang scratched his head. "Fine, I'll do as you say."

Then, as if remembering something, he added, "Oh, that disciple from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect outside—he's a relative of mine, a man of extraordinary talent! Once this matter is settled, you should show him that calligraphy piece you've been struggling with. He might have some unique insights..."

The Buddhist Master was taken aback and chanted a Buddhist mantra before sighing. "With a mind like yours, you actually have such a talented relative?"

"Of course," Jia Shifang replied. "Don't judge by my simple mind—my second brother is full of cunning and would grasp the teachings of our Vajra Temple perfectly."

The Buddhist Master felt something was off about this statement, as if the entire Vajra Temple had been subtly insulted.

By the time he looked up again, Jia Shifang had already left the pavilion, bidding a reluctant farewell to Li Zhengjing before they each went their separate ways to bury the prayer beads.

"The wealthiest family in the Great Zhou Dynasty, the Jias, and now a relative who's joined the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect?" The Buddhist Master's expression shifted slightly as he thought of the recent upheaval in the capital. "The Crown Prince was killed by the Gu King Xin Xuan. It seems the world is on the brink of great change..."

"Behind Xin Xuan stands the 'Creditor.' Is he trying to overturn the future of the mortal world single-handedly?" he mused. "If so, his next appearance will likely be an attempt to overthrow the immortal sects and Buddhist temples beyond the mortal realm."

With a sigh, he murmured, "After all these years, the opportunity is nearly ripe. The Creditor must be preparing to reap his harvest..."

But now, after generations of cultivation by human immortals, which sect leader would willingly surrender such a prize?

Thus, the only solution was for the immortal sects and Buddhist temples to unite, find the shared "Creditor," and ensure his demise—for only death erases debt!

Meanwhile, in Xuanling Prefecture.

Within its thirty-two cities, in a place called Siyecheng, two men sat facing each other in a courtyard.

The man on the left was burly, with dark skin and an empty left sleeve.

"Brother Xin Xuan, dressed in Great Zhou attire, you don't stand out as much now."

"Great Zhou clothing is flashy but impractical—such a waste of fabric," Xin Xuan replied, eyeing the elderly man across from him.

The old man wore Daoist robes and carried a golden token—clearly an inner elder of the Ancient Moon Peak under the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.

"The Beast Taming Hall of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect has been the most troublesome opponent I've ever faced," Xin Xuan said slowly. "Of the twenty-six thousand newly hatched larvae I scattered across Xuanling Prefecture, most have been devoured by the exotic beasts they control..."

The elder chuckled. "For a single Beast Taming Hall elder and thirty inner disciples to focus solely on the gu insects you crafted speaks volumes of your skill."

He continued calmly, "Your cultivation is only at the mid-level of the True Qi realm, yet with the poison of your lifebound gu, even upper-level True Qi experts must tread carefully. Before coming here, I heard you wiped out three hundred Crimson Scale Army soldiers who tried to intercept you outside the capital—such a feat is truly remarkable."

Xin Xuan smirked arrogantly. "I merely poisoned their food beforehand. Nothing impressive."

The elder adjusted his robes and grasped the golden token bearing his name—engraved with the characters "Zhou Li."

"With this token shielding you, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's searchers won't detect this place. But we still shouldn't linger..." Elder Zhou Li said. "After our earlier discussion, I released the batch of gu insects you refined into Jingye Prefecture and Tianyuan Prefecture—creating false trails to divert the imperial forces and the other sects' search parties."

"However, this tactic isn't foolproof. The Young Sect Leader of Kunlun and the Buddhist Master of the Vajra Temple likely suspect you're still in Xuanling Prefecture, which is why they bypassed Jingye and Tianyuan to come here directly."

With a sigh, Zhou Li added, "I can hide you from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, but I can't stop the imperial army, nor can I intimidate the Kunlun Young Master or the Vajra Buddhist Master. You must find a way to escape Xuanling Prefecture as soon as possible."

Xin Xuan scoffed. "The esteemed Young Sect Leader of Kunlun and the Vajra Temple's Buddhist Master, joining forces to capture me? You so-called orthodox figures sure hold this savage from the southern wilds in high regard."

"They're likely after the 'Creditor,'" Zhou Li said. "The life or death of the 'Creditor' involves a great secret of this world. Most believe he perished alongside the previous sect leader of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, but now that traces of him have reappeared, it's caused an uproar..."

He looked at Xin Xuan. "Fortunately, the recent incident of the Ghost Valley Spirit Official returning to the Golden Ship of Salvation has put the higher-ups on edge, making them hesitant to act rashly. Otherwise, you wouldn't have remained hidden and unharmed for this long."

"But if this drags on, and a Human Immortal steps in, Xuanling Prefecture will be turned upside down—and you'll have nowhere left to hide."

Xin Xuan snorted, his eyes gleaming with defiance. "If not for your delays, I'd already be back in the Southern Wastes by now, not trapped here."

He raised his muscular right arm, revealing a horned black snake coiled around it. 

"If Xuanling Prefecture is no longer safe, I leave today."

"Should anyone try to stop me, I'll have all thirty-two cities of Xuanling Prefecture buried with me!"

"Elder Zhou Li, prepare everything for me."

His gaze was ruthless as he stared at the elder.

Zhou Li rose slowly and nodded. "I'll have everything ready within an hour."

With that, he left his golden token behind and exited the courtyard.

He walked through the streets until he reached the northern part of the city, then pushed open the gate of another courtyard.

Inside lay an old man—lifeless, his vitality extinguished.

"Senior Brother Zhou Li," the "elder" murmured, looking down at the corpse. "You shouldn't have investigated the 'Creditor.' Forgive me for what I must do."

He peeled off a mask, revealing himself as none other than the current Chief Enforcer of the Ancient Moon Peak's Law Enforcement Hall!

From his robes, he retrieved a bronze mirror.

Tapping it with a finger, a faint glow shimmered within.
