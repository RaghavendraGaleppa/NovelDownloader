# Chapter 125: The Chixiao Secret Realm and the Distribution of All Six Qi

Half a day earlier, Gu Yuan had been discussing the secret realm obtained by Ma Wu with Bian Chuyao in this very place. The copied version of the Chixiao Secret Codex was still in his hands. Yet now, within half a day, Ma Wu had personally come to offer him the secret realm.  

This made Gu Yuan sigh once more at the allure of spiritual Qi and Foundation Establishment.  

"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."  

"What kind of secret realm is it? Why not take it for yourself, Nephew?" Gu Yuan asked with a smile.  

"To be honest, I have already entered this secret realm once and obtained some opportunities, which allowed me to cultivate supreme-grade spiritual sense. However, the realm is fraught with dangers, filled with Foundation Establishment-level demonic entities. My strength is feeble, and I am unworthy of such treasures. It would be better to offer it to you, Uncle, for you to claim!"  

"This secret realm belonged to the Chixiao Sect, a Golden Core sect from a thousand years ago. Within it are countless exotic fruits, precious elixirs, and marvelous techniques. If my guess is correct, there may even be supreme-grade spiritual artifacts or fragments of magic treasures!"  

Supreme-grade spiritual artifacts? Fragments of magic treasures?  

Gu Yuan's interest was immediately piqued.  

After Foundation Establishment, cultivation is divided into early, middle, and late stages, also known as the Three Revolutions of Foundation Establishment. Each breakthrough in a minor realm brings a significant increase in mana, and the power of the Dao Foundation is greatly enhanced, resulting in a substantial gap in combat strength.  

Spiritual artifacts used in Foundation Establishment are also categorized into primary, intermediate, and superior grades, corresponding to the three cultivation stages.  

Spiritual artifacts possess intelligence and formidable power, serving as a crucial means for cultivators. Obtaining a superior-grade spiritual artifact at the early stage of Foundation Establishment would greatly enhance one's combat strength. However, wielding an artifact beyond one's level can also be a burden. If one's mana is insufficient, they may even be drained dry, damaging their foundation. Generally, such artifacts are reserved as trump cards.  

As for supreme-grade spiritual artifacts, they are the pinnacle among spiritual artifacts, possessing unparalleled power.  

Magic treasures, on the other hand, are items only Golden Core masters can wield. Even fragments of such treasures hold terrifying power.  

Gu Yuan hadn't expected the Chixiao Sect's secret realm to contain such treasures. It seemed it truly hadn't been thoroughly explored.  

This Ma Wu truly had some luck on his side.  

Ma Wu, sensing Gu Yuan's interest, immediately prostrated himself and presented a jade key with both hands.  

The jade key was no larger than a finger, golden-jade in color, with intricate patterns flowing within it. However, its luster was dim, as if most of its power had been exhausted, and it was slowly replenishing.  

"This jade key is the means to open the Chixiao Secret Realm. Every ten years, by channeling mana into it atop the southern mountain's red cliff, one can open the realm's gate."  

"I last activated this realm eight years ago. To open it again, we need only wait two more years!"  

As he spoke, his tone carried a hint of sorrow, and he pleaded in a low voice, "Though my appearance has not yet aged, I am already nearly fifty years old. The sixty-year lifespan limit is not far off, and I cannot afford to waste time any longer. I beg you, Uncle, to grant me this opportunity!"  

His current cultivation was entirely due to what he had obtained in the secret realm. Otherwise, he would have remained an ordinary disciple.  

The realm was fraught with unknown dangers. Escaping unscathed the last time was already a stroke of luck. Without Foundation Establishment, further exploration would be impossible.  

Originally, he had planned to use the realm's treasures to defeat the aristocratic disciples, seize spiritual Qi, break through to Foundation Establishment, and then explore the realm again. That way, he could rise above his humble origins.  

Most of the common-born prodigies in the Dao Academy had followed such a script.  

But who could have predicted... he would ultimately lose to Bian Chuyao, his efforts coming to naught.  

No matter how great the opportunities in the secret realm were, without Foundation Establishment, they would be wasted.  

Most crucially, rumors had begun circulating within the sect about the impending war in the Chiyue Great River.  

This would not be a minor skirmish but a full-scale battle.  

Qi Refinement disciples would be mere cannon fodder!  

Without Foundation Establishment, life and death would be uncertain!  

The precedent set by the Falling Clouds Sect was still fresh in memory. Even the disciples of Golden Core masters had perished in battle. Only by achieving Foundation Establishment could one gain a sliver of control over their fate. Otherwise, survival in the midst of war would be precarious, especially for common-born disciples.  

This was why the pursuit of spiritual Qi was so fervent within the sect.  

Time was running out!  

The Azurefire Golden-eyed Ape Clan had dominated the Chiyue Great River for thousands of years. They were not to be trifled with.  

Previous conflicts, such as those at the Cloudcliff Shell Field and Flying Wave Mountain, had been insignificant skirmishes for the Azurefire Golden-eyed Apes—mere peripheral losses they had tacitly allowed the Dao Academy to take.  

But this time would be different.  

And so, he had offered up his greatest secret, hoping to achieve Foundation Establishment as soon as possible.  

Having laid all his cards on the table, Ma Wu prostrated himself on the ground, anxiously awaiting Gu Yuan's response.  

"There is no need for such formalities. Rise quickly. Soon, we shall address each other as peers!"  

A voice came from above, causing Ma Wu's spirits to soar, his heart filled with joy!  

"Thank you, Uncle! Thank you, Uncle!" Ma Wu exclaimed excitedly.  

After years of arduous cultivation, the gate to Foundation Establishment had finally opened for him.  

"Do not rush to thank me yet. Though the secret realm is valuable, service is indispensable. For fifty years, you must follow me into battle in the Chiyue Great River, advancing and retreating together."  

Gu Yuan stored the jade key away before adding calmly, "Commanding a Foundation Establishment cultivator is the greatest value of spiritual Qi."  

"I shall follow your lead without hesitation!" Ma Wu replied immediately, without the slightest doubt.  

So-called service was merely a form of duty, not slavery. He had long been prepared for this and had no objections.  

If he could achieve Foundation Establishment, fifty years would pass in the blink of an eye.  

"Good."  

Gu Yuan chuckled lightly and waved his sleeve. A crimson-gold strand of spiritual Qi floated out, circling before Ma Wu.  

Overjoyed, Ma Wu couldn't help but bow deeply once more.  

"Focus on your cultivation. I hope we may soon address each other as peers."  

Gu Yuan offered a few words of encouragement.  

A strand of spiritual Qi was an investment. He did not wish for it to fail.  

"Once I achieve Foundation Establishment, I shall return to pay my respects and swear a Dao Heart Oath!"  

Ma Wu bowed deeply once more before taking the spiritual Qi and returning to his cave abode to begin his closed-door cultivation.  

---  

As time passed, the competition among the Hundred Arts outside the Earthflame Cave gradually came to an end.  

A common-born disciple named Lü Zijing distinguished himself in the art of artifact forging, crafting a flawless supreme-grade magic tool in the shortest time and surpassing all others to obtain a strand of Gold-Metal spiritual Qi.  

Another common-born female disciple, Fu Youling, excelled in alchemy and obtained a strand of Azurewood spiritual Qi.  

In addition, an elderly common-born disciple nearing sixty, who had unique insights into spirit field cultivation, also received a strand of spiritual Qi.  

Since these three disciples had no other treasures to offer, Gu Yuan made an agreement with them to serve him for a hundred years, which they gladly accepted.  

With that, Gu Yuan had fully distributed all the spiritual Qi in his possession—two strands to aristocratic disciples and four to common-born disciples, covering both combat and support roles. This barely constituted the foundation of his own faction.  

Not wishing to reveal his Threefold Foundation Establishment yet, he spread the word that the remaining two strands of spiritual Qi were reserved for future use and would not be distributed further. Though this disappointed many Qi Refinement cultivators, there was nothing they could do.  

The Gu Faction had been established, forming its own power bloc. Within the Dao Academy, unless a mighty figure intervened, who could oppose him?  

However, such prominence naturally invited envy.  

Among the seven aristocratic lineages, some long-established Foundation Establishment cultivators began to take notice of Gu Yuan.  

Yet everyone remained on the sidelines, quietly awaiting the war in the Chiyue Great River.  

This would be a crucible—true gold fears no fire.  

Meanwhile, Gu Yuan was also busy enhancing his own strength.  

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye. The Three-Eyed Spirit Water and Stone Nectar had both been fully accumulated.
