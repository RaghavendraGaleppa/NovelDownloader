Chapter 103: Against Evil Cultists, There Is No Need for Reason!

The sky was dimming, the sun just setting as the bright moon began to rise. The temple fair at the Lingjiang Dock was finally coming to an end.

The temple keeper casually waved his hand. In the temple, the head of the smiling Buddha holding a flower suddenly flew off and landed on his own head.

He turned around to look at the three figures behind him.

"Are you three here to offer incense and worship the Buddha, or to make a wish?"

Hearing this, the person wearing a dragon mask among the three stepped forward and spoke.

"Relying on others is不如 relying on oneself."

"Good."

The smiling Maitreya nodded slightly, the smile on the Buddha's head on his own growing even wider, as if very satisfied with this answer.

"You three brothers have given me a pleasant surprise."

"From today on, you are members of the Fine Rain Tower. You can go to the Dark Tower to take on bounties."

"If you handle that matter well, you can be promoted exceptionally to the Human Slayer."

He opened his palm, and lying in his large hand were three copper swallows.

For a moment, these swallows seemed to possess their own life, like living creatures, even flapping their wings.

"Don't worry. Once the job is done, these swallows will be given to you."

"May I ask what the job is?"

The Three Tyrants of Huai Mountain exchanged glances. The one with the dragon mask spoke in a muffled voice.

The smiling Maitreya said calmly:

"Follow me to deliver a batch of goods, flowing straight down the river."

"Remember, this matter is confidential. Do not reveal it to anyone, lest the people of the Clear Abyss Sect find out and cause trouble."

"If the news leaks, no one can save you brothers."

Delivering goods?

And absolutely not allowed to be known by the Clear Abyss Sect?

Otherwise, it would be eternal damnation?

The three—Dragon, Tiger, and Leopard—exchanged glances and fell into silence.

The smiling Maitreya thought that the three brothers felt the risk was too high and were unwilling to risk offending the Clear Abyss Sect.

So he spoke with a smile again:

"Old brother, I've been a temple keeper at this dock for over ten years. I see fishermen fishing every day, and I've learned a truth."

"The bigger the storm, the more valuable the fish!"

"If you three brothers don't want to take risks, how can you rise to the top?"

After a long silence.

Li Mo was surprised inwardly but didn't show any unusual expression. He continued to ask:

"Since you want us to take the risk, you should at least tell us what goods we are delivering."

"It's nothing more than sending some children to the base of the Demon Summoning Sect."

The smiling Maitreya answered patiently and then asked:

"You three are smart people. Have you considered it?"

As his words fell.

In the small temple, it seemed as if Buddhist chants echoed, making people relax physically and mentally.

The meaning was very clear.

The matter has been told to you; this贼船 (thieves' ship) is not something you can get off as you wish.

The dragon mask cupped his hands in salute:

"We are willing to do our utmost."

The smiling Maitreya had just relaxed his mind. Before he could nod and say something.

A short knife hidden in the shadows stabbed straight towards his back heart.

The strike was silent, and it only revealed a terrifying killing intent when it was close to the target.

The smiling Maitreya was indeed at the Divine Observation Realm, with an extremely fast reaction speed.

His body twisted strangely, like a slippery snake, dodging this fatal blow.

Then he turned around abruptly and caught the short knife between his fingers.

If he hadn't practiced Buddhist arts and awakened from the killing intent in time, this blow would have caused him serious injury.

"What are you trying to do!?"

The smiling face on the Buddha's head instantly turned into a wrathful Vajra.

No one answered.

What awaited him was a spreading mist, like a dark cloud accumulating countless storms, filling every space around him.

A Domain?

---

The smiling Maitreya quickly realized that this only looked like a domain but lacked the pressure of an Internal Scene martial artist.

However.

The chilling cold still pierced his bones to the marrow.

"Ying Bing!?"

Whoo—

A strong wind blew. The light cyan internal energy sword light and the silent sword technique's killing intent swept together, making the blood light around him waver.

He raised his palms and pushed forward. Two palm shadows scattered the sword and knife.

But what followed was two bright long swords.

One red, one blue, intertwined, endlessly generating, like a pair of ice and fire dragons entangled together.

Crack—

This stunning sword strike seemed to have hit something hard like metal.

"Cough!"

He coughed out a mouthful of burning ice shards.

This sword almost killed him. If he hadn't reacted so fast.

Strange to say, there were no wounds on his body surface, but the headless golden body in the temple suddenly dimmed a lot.

"If I hadn't painstakingly managed this place for over ten years, I would have capsized in the ditch today!"

"Li Mo, you actually delivered yourself to my door..."

He didn't even finish his words.

"Against evil cultists, there is no need for reason! Attack together!"

"I'll smash the Buddha statue; you guys cut him!"

A hammer appeared in Li Mo's hand as he spoke to coordinate.

He had seen it: unless he smashed this Buddha statue, he couldn't kill the other party in a short time.

This Divine Observation Realm guy was quite tricky.

The smiling Maitreya: "......"

He wanted to stop them.

But he had to face the other three.

Mainly Ying Bing. The other two were just annoying flies; as a mid-stage Divine Observation expert, he could deal with them casually.

This little girl was too terrifying.

Even in a one-on-one fight, relying on the incense and faith power accumulated over more than ten years, he would probably be suppressed.

And now there's Li Mo added to the mix.

The intelligence he received said Li Mo used a sword; when did he suddenly pull out a hammer...

Boom—

The third style of the Calm Heaven and Earth Hammer, the Thunder Stabilizing Extreme.

When this hammer fell, there was rolling wind and thunder, like the thunder that resounded through the heavens on the day of Awakening of Insects after accumulating throughout the winter, shaking the eight wilds!

Is this really the Internal Energy Realm?!

In his extreme shock, the smiling Maitreya could only throw a string of black prayer beads, hoping to block it for a moment.

He didn't expect that as soon as the prayer beads approached, they let out the wails of vengeful spirits and were obliterated by the overflowing aura.

The faith power accumulated for more than ten years.

Under the true divine punishment, it was also destroyed with ease.

Dang—

The sound of a bell rang out, piercing through metal and cracking stone.

Slowly, spiderweb-like cracks appeared on the golden body.

Then pieces of the golden body peeled off, revealing the white bones inside.

He could finally no longer resist the cold sword energy.

The cold wind blew, passing straight through his body.

The sword energy that rustled through the forest pierced him like a sieve. The blood didn't have time to flow before it was frozen by the frost.

...

At the same time.

Rumble—

At the Lingjiang Dock, a young man in brocade clothes who was inquiring along the street suddenly froze upon hearing such a commotion.

"That direction is..."

"That's the Maitreya Temple. Usually, before we go fishing, we go there to pray for the Buddha's blessing."

The old fisherman's words flashed through Luo Yu's mind like a thunderclap.

The Maitreya Temple?

Many children went missing near the Maitreya Temple during the temple fair, didn't they?

Without thinking, he leaped up like a startled swan and swept towards the direction from which the noise had just come.
