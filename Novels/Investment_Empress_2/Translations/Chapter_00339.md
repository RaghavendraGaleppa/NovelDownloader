# Chapter 339: What Is She Hiding? The Little Princess's New Opponent

Li Mo's plan wasn't complicated, especially with a group of Demon Kings and great demons cooperating with him. These senior demons, if placed among humans, would be at the Fifth Realm Outer Scenery or even Sixth Law Body level.

How to make the local people believe in him?

Simple—perform miracles before them.

He was far too familiar with this tactic. All those novels he'd read weren't for nothing. Little Li was an expert in all kinds of posturing for the masses.

He'd give the people of the Southern Border a small taste of the "King of Swag's"震撼, and there would be no worries about not becoming their new "god."

Once the time was ripe, he would slowly fade away.

After discussing the details of the plan, the sky began to darken.

The demons exchanged glances, feeling that the Peerless Flood Dragon truly lived up to his reputation as a genius. His proposal was simply breathtaking.

"The senior demons have eaten their fill. You may retire to the Jiawei Tavern."

After a while.

Li Mo bid farewell to the demons and prepared to return to the tavern with Ying Bing.

The central command tent was, after all, Commander Qu's place for handling military affairs. He couldn't just stay there to recuperate until he fully recovered.

His arms hung limply as he walked along the street with Ying Bing. The pedestrians and carriages had long since packed the snow down hard, making it feel like walking on ice.

Every now and then, someone would slip and land squarely on their backside, unable to get up.

The Southern Border had never seen such heavy snow.

On the street, children had made sleds, letting their big yellow dogs pull them along. There were also little kids skiing and having snowball fights, even engaging in role-playing.

"It's my turn to be Young Master Li!"

"I've been the Disaster Beast twice today!"

"Hurry, hurry, give me the sword!"

Li Mo looked at the children fighting over a straight tree branch not far away, and his eyes lit up.

"Good sword, truly a divine sword."

"?"

Ying Bing glanced at the Chixiao sword at his waist, her deep, clear eyes flashing with helplessness.

The saying "men remain boys until death" was perfectly embodied in Little Li.

This was evident from how, just a moment ago, he had carefully taken the ice lid from a water jar he passed, afraid it would break when he pulled it out, but once he got it out intact, he smashed it to pieces on the ground and asked her excitedly if it was impressive.

If she didn't hold him back, he might have gone off to slide on the ice.

"Li Mo."

Ying Bing extended her small hand.

"Alright."

The eager Li Mo ultimately chose to hold the ice lump's hand (or rather, be held by the ice lump).

Her small hand, cool and fragrant in his palm, gradually warmed up, making Li Mo a bit bolder. He would occasionally try to slide forward a little.

Sometimes when he walked slowly, sensing his intentions, Ying Bing would give him a slight glare and pull him forward for a little slide.

It felt... kind of happy?

Ying Bing turned back to look at him. This少年, who would soon be seventeen, was about to become a hero whose name would shake the world. The Hidden Dragon List would soon spread his deeds throughout the nine heavens and ten earths.

Yet here he was, holding her hand with a bright smile, like a grown boy who hadn't yet matured.

She felt a strange, ticklish sensation in her heart.

It was as if something had taken root and sprouted...

Hmm...

Perhaps, maybe, it was because she'd been wearing the Taiyin Liuxian Skirt for too long. Her Taiyin energy was already abundant, and now it was becoming slightly restless...

...

Late Night.

Inside the small world.

Looking around, the misty haze was almost gone. The seven stars, including the sun and moon, and the various landscapes carefully constructed by the尊大人 himself, everything was thriving with an extraordinary aura.

Its area was now half the size of a city.

When Li Mo breaks through to the Inner Scenery, it might be as large as Yunzhou City.

When he reaches the Inner Scenery realm, he could project this small world as a field domain, covering an entire city!

Just thinking about it was staggering.

However, the尊大人 was not currently thinking about field domains.

"Just now, what was the ice lump hiding and tidying up?"

On the way back to the tavern, Ying Bing seemed to have suddenly remembered something and asked him to wait outside the door.

---

Little Li found it a bit strange.

Through the door, he saw the ice lump putting something into the big-headed doll. It looked like... clothing?

"Could it be a local Southern Border style... that she's worn before?"

Thinking of this, the尊大人's body trembled, and the contemplation in his eyes grew even deeper.

"Teacher... what... what are you thinking about?"

A timid voice spoke.

Little Princess Jiang had just entered when she saw her尊 teacher standing there with a profound and unfathomable expression.

Could he be contemplating some profound principle of the Great Dao?

"This kind of thing, those who understand, understand."

"Those who don't, wouldn't understand even if I explained."

The尊大人 retracted his thoughts and sighed softly, shaking his head.

"Oh..."

Little Princess Jiang obediently stopped asking, becoming even more convinced of her guess.

Her teacher's thoughts were too profound; she probably wouldn't understand even if he told her.

Besides, she had something more important to say:

"Teacher, Aunt Mei... Aunt Mei wants to take me... take me away from Ziyang Prefecture."

"But... but Big Brother Li hasn't returned yet."

"The Southern Border is so dangerous now. Is he... is he okay?"

When Jiang Chulong asked this, her stammering was noticeably better.

Li Mo was stunned.

Did the people at Ziyang Prefecture already know what had happened in the Southern Border?

Does that mean the elders of the Qingyuan Sect know too?

The good news of the great victory at Qingmu City probably hasn't had time to be sent back. They must be very worried right now...

"He's fine."

The尊 teacher softened his voice and patted Little Princess Jiang's head.

"Really?"

Jiang Chulong bit her lip, and through the cloth band, one could see her eyes trembling slightly.

"When have I ever lied to you?"

The尊大人 couldn't help but laugh, then added:

"Besides, not long from now, the Hidden Dragon List will be released, and everyone in the world will know. You'll see it too."

"Mm..."

Jiang Chulong let out a sigh of relief,抚着 her chest, then asked in a small voice:

"Teacher, today... who will I be sparring with?"

"Today's opponent is a bit different."

The尊大人 smiled mysteriously and took out a Divine Observation Painting.

This was from an investment return. It depicted a young general who had fought countless battles on the battlefield, containing the true meaning of the battlefield.

It was a Upper Form.

Currently, the众生之力 stored in the Empty Color Pagoda was only enough to fill a little more than one layer of the thirty-six layers, which was just enough to project an Upper Form.

The众生之力 flowed from the small pagoda into the浑天反真镜.

The mirror light shone on the painting, causing a figure to step out from it.

The figure wore ancient battle armor and held a massive Mo blade. His aura was around the Divine Observation realm.

"This person was the heir of Prince Helian during the Great Shang Dynasty."

"This projection contains a portion of his power and the essence of his techniques."

"Your lesson today is to defeat him!"

"He is only the first. In the future, you will have countless opponents. You must defeat them, nurture your own true Sword Dao, until your Sword Bone is reborn!"

From the information given by the Fate Divine Eye.

Little Princess Jiang was fifteen years old.

And the moment she stepped into the Divine Observation realm would be the moment her Sword Bone was reborn!
