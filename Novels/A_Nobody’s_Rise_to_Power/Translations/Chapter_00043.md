# Chapter 43: Is Yang Er Taking the Bait?

Zhang Yunyi’s inner residence was a labyrinth of winding corridors and secluded paths. The numerous pavilions and verandas were scattered in a way that anyone unfamiliar with the layout would easily get lost.

Next to the dressing table stood a lamp stand with a delicate wooden frame, intricately carved with patterns and shaped with unique elegance. This was an exquisite bedroom. Eight tallow candles on the stand lit the room brightly.

A beautiful young woman sat before the mirror, wearing a sheer, translucent nightgown. Her figure was striking, with a slender waist and curvaceous hips. Under the window sat a rosewood table with tea and snacks. On a nearby armchair sat a man in his thirties, also in a nightgown. He was Zhang Xinyan, the eldest son of Zhang Yunyi. The Zhang Master had fathered him at seventeen, so the age gap between father and son wasn't very large. The beautiful woman removing her makeup in the mirror was his wife, Chen Wan.

Suddenly, a knock came at the door. Young Master Zhang, who was snacking and drinking tea, immediately stood up and walked over quickly. He opened the door to find a servant boy standing outside, his face brimming with excitement. "Young Master, it's done!"

Zhang Xinyan joyfully asked, "Director Yang slept with her?"

The servant boy replied, "The lamp has been hung."

"Ha ha, good, very good!" Young Master Zhang said proudly, "This time, I've finally got a handle on him! I'd like to see how he's going to cause trouble for my Zhang family now, haha..."

After laughing a few times, he waved his hand. "Go on, keep watching. Report any news immediately."

The servant boy agreed and ran off quickly. Young Mistress Chen sat at her vanity, curling her lips in disdain.

"You and your father are the only ones who would do such a thing. Sangzhi is your father's concubine, your little aunt. You sent her off to be used by someone, and you're both so delighted about it. Really... I don't even know what to say."

Sangzhi was Zhang Yunyi's "concubine," while the "consorts" were usually used for gifting or serving guests. There was actually a difference between the two. For someone of the Zhang Master's status, even for entertaining guests, it should be a consort, not a concubine. Therefore, once Yang Can touched her, the Zhang Master would have grounds to make a move against him.

*I came to inspect, and to show respect, I even had my own concubine serve tea! But how could you pull my concubine onto your bed?* If this matter were blown up, Yang Can would be marked by the Clan Master: *This man is unfit for important tasks!* Even if he fell for a beauty trap, he would still be deemed unreliable. This price was enough to make Director Yang reach some sort of tacit understanding with him.

Young Master Zhang glared at his wife. "What does a woman know about this? This is called strategy. What's a mere concubine? If I can't part with a beautiful concubine, how can I hook Yang Can?"

"Hmph!" The young mistress scoffed dismissively and gracefully rose to go to bed.

Young Master Zhang, having just received such good news, felt a heavy stone lifted from his heart and was in high spirits. Seeing Wan'er bend over to spread the sheets, her slender waist folded, creating a perfectly smooth curve. Her top was lifted by the movement, revealing a patch of snow-white skin on her back. The place where her hip met her waist formed two charming, shallow dimples. Young Master Zhang's interest flared immediately. He grinned lecherously and leaned in.

"You beast, how annoying!" the young mistress娇嗔ed, and the candles in the room were extinguished one by one, gradually plunging it into darkness.

Xiao Tan's technique was extremely proficient, clearly the result of rigorous training. She scrubbed and massaged, attending to every part, yet she remained serious and maintained a perfect, appropriate distance. Yang Can couldn't help but sigh to himself that his own Second Director was not as good at enjoying life as that rural landlord.

After Yang Can finished his bath, Xiao Tan brought a dry piece of ge cloth. She held the cloth open with both hands, eyes lowered, and said respectfully, "Director Yang, please get dressed."

She held the cloth high, level with her eyebrows, so she wouldn't see Yang Can's body. Yang Can took the thick, dry cloth and wrapped it around himself. He didn't need to wipe much; the ge cloth had excellent absorbency and quickly soaked up all the water droplets on his body.

Xiao Tan bowed slightly. "This servant will wait outside. If the Director has any instructions, just call out." With that, she gracefully withdrew.

Yang Can had been prepared to firmly reject the temptation of beauty. In the end, she didn't even give him the chance, and for a moment, he felt a bit of a letdown. After he changed into fine cotton sleeping clothes and draped his wet hair over his shoulders, he walked out of the bathroom. Xiao Tan was standing outside respectfully. As soon as she saw him come out, she led him to the bedroom.

Yang Can entered the bedroom, and Xiao Tan stopped at the door, her voice sweet. "This maid will rest in the side room. Young Master, if you need anything, just call for me at any time." After saying that, she closed the door for him.

Yang Can hummed a tune as he untied his sash and walked toward the bed. Suddenly, he noticed a lump on the already-made bed. Yang Can was surprised and quickly took two steps forward, reaching out to pull the blanket. But to his surprise, he couldn't lift it. Inside the blanket, Miss Sangzhi was lying there. Obviously, she was completely naked, because although Yang Can couldn't lift the blanket, it was because Sangzhi was holding it down. However, the blanket was still pulled open a corner, revealing a tender, smooth, round shoulder.

Yang Can exclaimed in shock, "Miss Sangzhi?"

Sangzhi smiled softly and charmingly, lowering her eyes with a shy expression. "Please, Master, have mercy."

***

Qingmei was wearing a round-collared robe, her hair simply tied in a ponytail. She had just finished her bath, and her hair was shiny and black. With her cheerful steps, the ponytail bounced lightly, radiating youthful energy. This was her first time taking on an external affairs task, and she was quite excited. However, because it was her first time, she had no idea how to proceed. Although she really wanted to get the upper hand on Yang Can, after thinking it over, she still had no clue. So, she decided to cooperate with Yang Can; at worst, she could just share some of the credit with him. Thus, she couldn't wait to run over.

Madam Sangzhi was the Zhang Master's favored concubine. The Zhang Master had disguised her as a servant girl in order to get a handle on Yang Can. After this happened, he wouldn't expose it immediately. If Yang Can was just going through the motions, he would act as if nothing had happened. If Yang Can really intended to deal with him, then he would bring this matter up and accuse Yang Can of forcing his favored concubine.

Xiao Tan was originally Sangzhi's personal maid and was still serving her now. It was just that the "master" had temporarily changed. In fact, Xiao Tan was quite interested in her mistress's "temporary master." After all, Yang Can was young and handsome, and which girl doesn't love a handsome man? So, after entering the side room, Xiao Tan didn't go to sleep but pressed her ear against the wall...

Before she could hear any interesting sounds, there was a sound of "thump, thump, thump" footsteps. Xiao Tan was slightly startled. Who would be barging in at this time? Wasn't this going to ruin her master's great plan? Xiao Tan hurriedly opened the door to welcome the visitor and saw a ponytail bouncing as it ran up the stairs.

"Who is it? Ah! Miss Qingmei?"

Qingmei ran up the stairs and, seeing no one to receive her, secretly curled her lips. *This is a village, no matter how grand it pretends to be, it's still undisciplined. A guest like me has come up the stairs, but no one has come out to greet me.* As she reached the top, she saw Xiao Tan in her nightclothes, her hair down,迎ing her with a flustered look.

Qingmei immediately became suspicious. "You're a servant girl, why aren't you sleeping downstairs? Dressed like this, you..."

Suddenly, Qingmei's eyes lit up with "thieving light": *So it's you, Yang Can, daring to be unfaithful behind my young mistress's back!*

For a moment, Qingmei felt a mix of excitement and anger, along with an indescribable pang of jealousy. She put on a stern face, pushed Xiao Tan aside, and barged into the room.

Inside the room, Yang Can saw the servant girl Sangzhi lying under the covers and quickly tied his sash. "Miss Sangzhi, what are you doing? I don't need anyone to keep me company." *Hmm, the psychological preparation for firmly rejecting the seduction that I had been酝酿 for a long time has finally been put to use.*

Sangzhi giggled, propping up her fragrant chin, exuding charm. "Serving the Director is the Master's arrangement, but I am also more than willing myself. It's just a matter of a night's passion, a spring dream without a trace. You don't need to take it to heart."

Yang Can said sternly, "You be quiet!" He was afraid that if this girl said any more, his resolve would waver. This woman was sent by the Zhang Master, and he didn't dare touch her. Did he really choose Feng'an Manor as his first stop just because it was closest to Phoenix Mountain Manor? Couldn't he have gone to the farthest one first and then worked his way back? He chose Feng'an Manor because he had found something suspicious while going through the accounts. Therefore, this Zhang Master was a target he had to take down. Zhang Yunyi was the sacrifice for Director Yang to make his name. Since he had decided to use Zhang Yunyi to establish his authority, how could he accept benefits from him?

Although he had accepted the other party's gold饼 earlier, that was different. He had already secretly turned that gold饼 over to Steward Deng and explained the reason. But how could he turn over a beautiful woman sent by the other party?

*But... a firm refusal will make the Zhang Master raise his guard against me, won't it? How can I refuse tactfully and without a trace?*

Yang Can was racking his brains when the door was "swung open" by the angry little Qingmei.

"Yang, you have some nerve..."

As the door opened, Qingmei put her hands on her hips, striking a pose like a teapot. At the same time, her eyes were wide open. Before, she had only guarded the door for her young mistress, hearing sounds but seeing nothing, which was frustrating. Today, I can finally watch clearly and openly.

*Huh?* The situation in the room seemed different from what she had imagined? Qingmei stood there, hands on hips, stunned. Her big eyes looked at Sangzhi on the bed, tightly wrapped in the blanket, her face pale with fright, and then at Yang Can, who was in his nightgown and looked righteous. Qingmei felt something was off.

When Yang Can saw Qingmei, his eyes lit up. He had finally found a suitable excuse! Yang Can took a leap to Qingmei's side and pulled the arm she had on her hips into his embrace.

"Qingmei, listen to me. I didn't call her to keep me company. In fact, I had no idea she was here. I was just taking a bath, and when I came back, she was lying there completely naked."

Qingmei's lips twitched a few times. She did want to hear Yang Can's explanation, and for him to sincerely repent and admit his mistake. But what was with this look of guilt, as if he had been caught cheating by his wife? Little Qingmei vaguely felt that the situation was developing in a direction she couldn't predict.
