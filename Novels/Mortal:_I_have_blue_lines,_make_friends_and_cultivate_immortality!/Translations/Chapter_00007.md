# Chapter 7: The Diamond Technique and the Ruler of Heaven Talisman Treasure!

The next day, everyone went out to set up their stalls—except for Lin Yun and Han Li.

"Brother Lin, aren't you going out with them?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"They're all seasoned veterans—I'm not worried about them. It's you I'm concerned about." Lin Yun glanced meaningfully at Han Li.

Under Lin Yun's gaze, Han Li immediately tensed up, growing wary. *Could it be because I revealed my pills yesterday? Is he taking advantage of everyone being out to deal with me?* The thought wasn't unfounded. After all, Lin Yun was at the tenth level of Qi Refinement, on the verge of breaking through to the eleventh—he would definitely need pills!

"Brother Lin, what about me?" Han Li forced a smile, masking his true thoughts. His hand subtly retreated into his sleeve, gripping a flying sword talisman tightly. If Lin Yun made any sudden moves, he would activate it immediately.

"Brother Han, I noticed you're already at the eighth level of Qi Refinement. Why did you trade those precious pills for that so-called Flying Sky Talisman yesterday? Wouldn't it have been better to keep them for your breakthrough to the ninth level?" Lin Yun asked bluntly.

Han Li hadn't expected Lin Yun's concern to be about this. They were practically strangers who had met by chance, yet this "Brother Lin" seemed genuinely considerate of him.

"Brother Lin, to be honest, the cultivation technique I practice only goes up to the eighth level. I haven't found the subsequent parts yet." Han Li sighed with a bitter smile, revealing his predicament.

"Is that so? Take a look—do any of these contain your technique? If not, we can search outside." Lin Yun handed Han Li a dozen cultivation manuals.

"*Flowing Cloud Technique, Golden Back Technique*..." Han Li flipped through them, and his eyes lit up when he saw *Evergreen Technique*. He hadn't expected Lin Yun to actually have it.

"Brother Lin, this is the one." Han Li held up the *Evergreen Technique* and returned the remaining manuals.

"Oh, the *Evergreen Technique*?!" Lin Yun looked surprised.

"Brother Lin, is there something wrong with it?" Han Li tensed at Lin Yun's reaction.

"Brother Han, don't misunderstand. The *Evergreen Technique* is as common as they come. You probably just had bad luck yesterday, focusing too much on talismans. This technique is practically worthless—just two spirit stones a copy," Lin Yun explained.

"Ah?" Lin Yun's words left Han Li dumbfounded, stirring an indescribable feeling in his heart.

*Master Mo, you treated an incomplete *Evergreen Technique* like a priceless treasure, yet it turns out to be nothing more than a common commodity...*

"Truly..."

"Ah—" Han Li sighed, his expression complex.

He then handed Lin Yun two spirit stones. "Brother Lin, consider this manual as purchased by me."

Lin Yun didn't take the stones. Instead, his face darkened. "Brother Han, I genuinely consider you a brother, yet you don't treat me as a friend! I brought this up and offered you the *Evergreen Technique*—do you think I did it for two measly spirit stones? If you truly see me as a friend and call me 'Brother Lin,' take those back! We hit it off from the start—talking about spirit stones only hurts our bond!"

Han Li hadn't expected such sincerity from Lin Yun. They had just met, yet Lin Yun had already shown him so much kindness. It seemed there were still good people in this world.

He then took out a bottle of Golden Marrow Pills and offered it to Lin Yun. "Brother Lin, you helped me before, and now you've given me this technique. This is the last bottle of pills I have—please accept it as my gratitude. May you soon reach the eleventh level of Qi Refinement and dominate the Ascension Conference!"

Lin Yun waved his hands frantically, inwardly screaming, *Don’t give them to me! Don’t!* Outwardly, however, he wore a stern expression, feigning anger. "Brother Han, you don’t value your own cultivation enough! Now that you have the complete *Evergreen Technique*, it’s time for your breakthrough! If you call me 'Brother,' how could I possibly take these pills? You’d be putting me in an unrighteous position!" His face twisted in exaggerated distress.

"Uh... this..." Seeing Lin Yun's passionate reaction, Han Li sheepishly withdrew the pills. If he insisted, wouldn't that reveal he still had more? "In that case, I’ll humbly accept. The kindness of gifting me this technique will be repaid in the future!" He clasped his fists solemnly.

*Brother Lin, it’s not that I’m stingy—it’s just that the matter of the little green bottle is too critical. I have to be cautious.*

**[Ding! Han Li’s favorability has increased. Current favorability: 60 (Deep Friendship). Host has gained one reward draw opportunity.]**  
**[Ding! Drawing in progress...]**  
**[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained the Talisman Treasure—Ruler of Heaven!]**  
**[Talisman Treasure—Ruler of Heaven: Originally belonging to Spirit Beast Mountain cultivator Lü Tianmeng, whom Han Li later killed. Upon activation, it can manifest countless miniature rulers, unleashing unparalleled offensive power!]**  

**[Ding! Host has gifted a friend the *Evergreen Technique*, triggering 'Give a Plum, Receive a Peach.']**  
**[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained the Spirit Realm Body Refinement Technique—Diamond Technique!]**  

"That’s more like it. Between brothers, such formalities only hurt our bond." Seeing the system notifications, Lin Yun grinned and patted Han Li’s shoulder. *Not only did I get a talisman treasure, but also the Spirit Realm’s Diamond Technique. What a steal!*  

"I noticed you bought talisman paper and spellbooks yesterday, and you seemed very interested in talismans. Are you planning to make them yourself?" Lin Yun changed the subject.  

"Ah?" Han Li was caught off guard by the question but nodded after a brief pause. "I wanted to give it a try."  

"But you only bought blank talisman paper—you didn’t get cinnabar or a talisman brush." Lin Yun rolled his eyes, exasperated.  

"Brother Lin, do these items have to be specially made by cultivators? Can’t ordinary materials from the mortal world be used?" Realizing his inexperience was showing, Han Li decided to ask outright.  

"Of course they have to be special! Crafting talismans is difficult—not just in skill but also materials. To successfully make a spiritual talisman, you need paper made from special ingredients and cinnabar mixed with the blood of spirit beasts.  

"As for brushes, there are two types: those made from the spiritual fur of beasts and those crafted from rare, heavenly materials like charcoal. Both can improve success rates and talisman potency.  

"Ordinary mortal brushes? Forget about them withstanding the corrosive nature of spirit beast blood—even if they somehow did, the success rate would be abysmal!" Lin Yun lectured seriously.  

"I see. Thank you for the guidance, Brother Lin." Han Li cupped his hands respectfully.  

"If you want to make talismans, you’ll need a proper brush. Let’s go find one later—maybe we can get a good one. I don’t feel comfortable letting you wander alone, especially with so many sect and clan cultivators gathering for the Ascension Conference." Lin Yun spoke with apparent concern.  

"Alright." Han Li nodded, now feeling deeply ashamed of his earlier suspicion. *To think I doubted Brother Lin with such petty thoughts...*  

With that, Han Li and Lin Yun headed out together.
