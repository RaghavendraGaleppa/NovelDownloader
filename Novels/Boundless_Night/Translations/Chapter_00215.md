Chapter 215: The Path Breaks, The Old Man Appears

Two divine chains on Li Qingxu's body snapped one after another, exploding like sticky runic light, blocking Qin Ming and forcing him back. Li Qingxu felt a blaze of anger ignite in his chest, burning straight to his head. This demon must be doing it on purpose, relentlessly targeting his head.

In fact, Qin Ming wasn't so obvious. After several slashes to the head, he had already switched targets, attacking vital areas like the chest and abdomen. During the fierce battle, even though Li Qingxu was utterly enraged, he didn't utter a single word. He felt he was disgracing his sect. As Cao Qianqiu's personal disciple, he was no match for a demon, being pushed to such a state, covered in blood. Uttering threats now would be meaningless.

However, he didn't panic. The remaining divine chains on his body coiled, penetrating into his spiritual consciousness and connecting to the depths of his flesh and blood. His power increased once more. Li Qingxu was well aware of the consequences if all nine divine chains were to break. His eyes narrowed slightly, revealing his full murderous intent.

Qin Ming raised his blade and charged directly. In an instant clash, Cao Qianqiu's created ultimate technique was seen again. The area became vibrant with colors, accompanied by a tidal wave of killing intent. With a *snap*, another nine-colored divine chain broke. Li Qingxu's abdomen was pierced by the Serpent Sword, sending him stumbling back, half his body stained red with blood. On his body, only four divine chains remained.

However, Qin Ming's expression turned serious, feeling increasingly that his opponent's state was off. Li Qingxu had clearly been heavily wounded multiple times, yet he remained remarkably calm.

Silence fell over the mountainous terrain. Both men watched each other. Li Qingxu's body surged with a large amount of silver light particles, while the four divine chains within him vibrated with a *clanging* sound. His bleeding abdomen and chest wounds were healing. A rustling sound emanated from around him, as vast expanses of silver bamboo groves appeared, with fine rain scattering from above. Directly over his head, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. For a moment, this spectacle captivated everyone watching from various sides. Everyone saw the problem: those four divine chains were vibrating, and then this wondrous phenomenon manifested.

Subsequently, a torrential downpour began over the battlefield. Dark clouds pressed down, thunder boomed, and lightning intertwined with the silver bamboo on the ground. This wasn't natural lightning drawn from the sky, as the dark clouds were too close to the ground, almost within reach. Even with his feather robes stained with blood, Li Qingxu still appeared quite ethereal. He raised his bamboo staff and pointed it at his opponent. With a *rumble*, terrifying lightning, one bolt after another, streaked across the void, striking down towards Qin Ming's head.

In the Secret Realm, many people stood on high mountains. Upon witnessing this scene, their expressions grew solemn. Li Qingxu's command over lightning terrified them; they questioned if they could withstand such a bombardment. No one expected Qin Ming to also unleash lightning, clashing head-on! Beneath his feet, the Earth Qi surged, and Li Fire blazed, turning the ground crimson. He used the *Wuji Scripture* and *Li Fire Scripture* to create Earth Fire. In mid-air, Wind-Thunder Force, Five Thunder Force, and Purple Mansion Thunder-Fire Force resonated, forming Heavenly Thunder. At the same time, he activated the *Heluo Scripture*, causing the Heavenly Thunder to ignite the Earth Fire.

Actually, he could unleash electrical flashes by simply employing one or two force techniques. But now, Qin Ming used several wondrous techniques to amplify his terrifying thunderous power significantly. In an instant, lightning flashed and thunder boomed between the two youths. Dazzling lights intertwined, the ground turned scorched black, and nearby trees exploded into splinters.

*Crack!* Ultimately, the dark clouds above Li Qingxu's head were dispersed, and the thunder disappeared. In this lightning duel, neither of them was at ease, each defending with other wondrous methods. After Qin Ming unleashed countless lightning bolts, he used the Yin-Yang Black and White Light from the Dragon-Serpent Scripture to block. Then, the instant the lightning dissipated, he charged forward. Li Qingxu was sent flying backward. This time, he was struck by the black and white light, spitting out a large mouthful of blood, smashing through a large swath of trees, and another divine chain in his flesh broke.

At this moment, on the various mountaintops in the Secret Realm, the people who had been nervously watching gradually came to their senses. Every time, Li Qingxu would create a grand display, but in the end, he would always be heavily struck. Many had originally held his techniques in awe, as they were all Cao Qianqiu's ultimate arts, but now their gazes upon him were strange.

"Every time he appears ethereal, unleashing all sorts of rumored ultimate moves with a captivating demeanor, but he loses every single time!"
"Exactly, he considers himself an immortal seed, and he never loses when it comes to style, but in actual combat, he hasn't won a single crucial battle." Someone couldn't help but comment like this. Even Li Qingxu's acquaintances, upon hearing this, couldn't help but nod in agreement. Back then, the most important battle of his life, he lost to Li Qingyue, narrowly missing out on that near-immortal artifact—the Eight Trigrams Furnace. Now, with two paths clashing, he was repeatedly heavily wounded by the youth from the Demonic Path.

"Li Qingxu, he can really take a beating!" someone sighed. Many noticed that he had been suppressed from start to finish, constantly getting injured, yet he never retreated, still standing firm in the arena. Precisely because of this, those who had been mocking him earlier gradually fell silent. If it were them, they would likely have died long ago. "One can only say that it's not Li Qingxu's lack of strength, but rather the youth from the Demonic Path who is even more formidable!"

Li Qingxu's body swayed, his face ashen. He said, "It shouldn't be like this. My master is Cao Qianqiu, how can I lose to a demon? I've shamed him!"

With a *snap*, this time he voluntarily broke a divine chain! Moreover, that dazzling divine chain was stained with his blood and accompanied by countless dense runes. At the same time, Li Qingxu's body glowed, and a large amount of light particles evaporated, all merging into that divine chain. A phoenix cry resounded through heaven and earth. The divine chain transformed into a blood phoenix, soaring upwards and diving towards Qin Ming, carrying endless killing intent.

Qin Ming activated the original demonic version of the *Dragon-Serpent Scripture*. The Dragon Blade in his hand was like a blazing sun, accompanied by surging demonic qi. He hacked at the blood phoenix with dozens, even hundreds, of blade lights in an instant, utterly shattering it. Although the blood phoenix was shattered, it didn't disappear. It floated above Qin Ming's head, as if it had captured his aura, performing some kind of marking.

Li Qingxu spoke, "Next, if I lose, then I accept it. It can only mean I haven't cultivated my teacher's sect-suppressing ultimate technique to its essence." At this moment, the six divine chains that had broken earlier within him all detached, rushed out, and disintegrated in the void. Countless runes then reassembled, forming a large-mouthed runic pouch. With a *rumble*, it enveloped Qin Ming.

"The Myriad Talisman Pouch, one of Cao Qianqiu's ultimate trump cards!" Many recognized this ultimate technique and were shocked. How could Li Qingxu have mastered it at this age? At this time, even immortal seeds and divine seeds like Li Qingyue, Cui Chonghe, Zhao Yaoting, and Su Shiyun were paying close attention, as this ultimate technique was too famous, its might shaking the Night Mist World. In the past, Cao Qianqiu once encountered an extremely dangerous formidable enemy and used the Myriad Talisman Pouch to absorb the opponent, refining them alive into a ball of blood mist. There were even rumors that a patriarch of the Rebirth Path, while in isolated cultivation in his later years, was almost trapped inside his Myriad Talisman Pouch and suffered severe injuries.

Qin Ming didn't dodge and was drawn into the pouch made of runes. Moreover, the shattered blood phoenix reappeared, pouncing on the Myriad Talisman Pouch, like a Phoenix Knot, binding the mouth of the pouch tightly. "Our demonic race's heaven-defying talent has been drawn into the Myriad Talisman Pouch. Is he... going to be refined?" a demon cried out in alarm. Even they had heard of Cao Qianqiu's trump card, and today his disciple had actually displayed it.

Li Qingxu formed hand seals, his spiritual consciousness boiling. He was refining the Myriad Talisman Pouch. After Qin Ming entered the pouch, he immediately felt waves of discomfort. Endless runes flashed, pressing in on him, attempting to burrow into his flesh and blood. Inside the pouch, countless streams of light, like blades and swords, continuously thrust through. Outside Qin Ming's body, the black and white Dragon-Serpent Diagram rotated, instantly blocking this erosion. "These runes don't feel like Li Qingxu's aura." Qin Ming frowned. He had felt something was off earlier, and now that strange premonition resurfaced in his mind. In any case, he had to get out first.

In the Secret Realm, those close to Li Qingxu breathed a sigh of relief, then cheered. After waiting for so long, they finally witnessed him turning the tables in adversity. "He... won't be in trouble, will he?" Jiang Ruoli, Gan Jincheng, and others had solemn expressions. Even Xin Youdao, who had some understanding of Qin Ming, frowned deeply. After all, Cao Qianqiu's Myriad Talisman Pouch was too famous. Little Wu's path vibrated; he almost couldn't resist making a move, but he trusted Qin Ming, believing he should be able to escape that dangerous situation.

No one could see what was happening inside the Myriad Talisman Pouch. Qin Ming naturally wouldn't hold back, immediately employing the Heaven-Light Force, a unified fusion of six wondrous techniques. Dazzling fist light, like a sun exploding, blasted against the Myriad Talisman Pouch. Then, everyone saw the shrinking runic pouch suddenly inflate, growing larger and larger, emitting dazzling golden radiance. Next, the entire pouch exploded with a *boom*.

Qin Ming didn't yet know how great the impact of his punch was. This was because even if a powerhouse of the same realm were trapped inside, they would have to pay a considerable price to break free. Yet, he had just entered, and in an instant, he broke out, moreover shattering the Myriad Talisman Pouch! This was simply earth-shattering!

At this moment, even Cui Chonghe from the Immortal Path had his pupils contract, staring intently, wanting to see through it all. Cai Jingcheng, Tang Yutian, and others from the Esoteric Sect also shot out divine light from their eyes, gazing this way, hoping to see the truth. Li Qingyue's beautiful eyes shone with a peculiar brilliance. With her fair, slender hands, she gently moved, performing a mysterious ultimate technique. Su Shiyun, Xue Yunzheng, Leng Feiyue, and other seeds from various paths all watched intently, no longer nonchalant, becoming serious.

Li Qingxu couldn't believe it, unable to accept it. He said, "How is this possible? In a duel of the same realm, no one can break through my master's ultimate technique like that!" In the Secret Realm, on various mountaintops, many people were dumbfounded, their hearts filled with immense shock. What a powerful generation of young demon was this?

"I really wish he could have been born in Cao Qianqiu's era. If he were there, he'd surely beat Old Cao to death. How could that old geezer be allowed to run rampant!" Instantly, the emotions of some demons were ignited, becoming exceptionally excited. "Our demonic race will greatly prosper!"

Qin Ming immediately realized that the power of his six wondrous techniques was too astonishing. It should surpass the Three Imperial Forces, and also be stronger than the Golden Body Nirvana cultivators of the Tathagata Sect and the Heaven-Shakers of the Sky-Shattering Sect! He immediately smiled faintly and said, "Old Cao's trump card is naturally incredibly powerful, but as his disciple, you haven't mastered it. The Myriad Talisman Pouch is full of flaws, with cracks intertwining in some places, even letting light through—it has serious defects!"

As he spoke, he moved like a phantom crossing the Night Mist Sea, teleporting to launch his final attack on Li Qingxu. In front of everyone, he still activated the *Dragon-Serpent Scripture*. Yin and Yang qi flowed, and black and white light burst forth. A great dragon and a great serpent flew from his hands, blasting towards his opponent, whose feather robes were in tatters.

Although Li Qingxu resisted with all his might, he truly couldn't hold on any longer. After several clashes, his spiritual consciousness was agonizingly burned by the extremely strong and pure Yang aura of the opponent's great dragon, on the verge of igniting. At the same time, he was repeatedly struck by the black and white light. His arm was broken, his chest caved in, and his purple bamboo staff flew from his grasp. In just a few breaths, Li Qingxu's leg bones snapped, and his shoulder blades nearly shattered. Even his forehead had been grazed by the black and white light, showing clear cracks. All over his body, countless bones were broken, and he was a bloody mess.

No one expected the demonic youth to grow stronger with each blow. In the final phase, he began to sweep through his opponent like a destructive force, giving the immortal seed no chance to breathe. Was he going to utterly crush him? "Didn't they say that those who bravely forge new paths would be protected and safe?" those close to Li Qingxu anxiously questioned. On the demons' side, many people shouted, "How exhilarating! This is our demonic race's unparalleled genius! What immortal seed? Suppress him, slaughter him!" "This young demon truly possesses extraordinary talent. Even an immortal seed like Li Qingxu is suppressed to such an extent. Who can contend with him?" Many disciples from external sects were deeply shaken.

"Alas, it has come to this. My Nine Dragon Nurturing Body Art has been broken by you just like that." Li Qingxu spat out a mouthful of bloody foam, actively snapping his last two divine chains.

"I don't care if you're Nine Dragons or Nine Worms!" Qin Ming activated the black and white light, sending Li Qingxu flying horizontally once more, almost tearing his body completely apart. Some wounds were already transparent, showing through from front to back.

At this moment, Li Qingxu's Immortal Path *boomed* as it snapped, then completely disintegrated. But precisely at this moment, after all nine divine chains had broken, a terrifyingly pure Yang light burst out from his body, instantly transforming into the image of an old man.

"What the hell!" Qin Ming really wanted to shout. Because after breaking through Li Qingxu and severing all nine divine chains, he actually saw Cao Qianqiu!
