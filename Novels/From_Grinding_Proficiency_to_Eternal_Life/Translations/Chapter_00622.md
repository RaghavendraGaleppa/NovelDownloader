# Chapter 622: The Sea of Worlds

The author: The Crow is Black Enough

How far could he flee?

"Ant, today, this Sovereign will pursue you to the ends of the Sea of Worlds to seize your soul and refine it into a lamp!"

Qingyuan True Lord was so furious that his chest felt ready to explode, flames seemingly rising three feet above his head.

To be repeatedly humiliated and severely wounded by a mere Foundation Establishment ant, and to have him escape right before his eyes with someone else—this was an absolute, unprecedented humiliation.

If the other True Lords were to find out, he would never be able to hold his head high in their circle again.

If he could not reduce Xu Yunfan to ash, his Dao Heart would be left with cracks, and his cultivation might even regress.

This matter was simply too shameful.

As a demonic True Lord, he had suffered repeated setbacks, and his very Grotto-heaven had been pierced through and damaged.

He immediately prepared to circulate the Wondrous Dao True Method of Heaven and Earth's Pure Qi, drawing upon the residual Pure Qi of the Immortal Palace to protect his body. He was about to move, to step into that chaotic void passage to pursue Xu Yunfan's trail.

A violent aura surged toward the heavens.

However, at that very moment—

"Clang!"

An indescribably sharp Sword Intent, carrying the power to sever all things and seem capable of shaking down the stars, descended from beyond the nine heavens, or perhaps溯回 from the end of time. Without any warning, it suddenly pierced the air high above the East Sea, which had only just begun to calm.

This Sword Intent's aura was incredibly familiar to Qingyuan True Lord.

It was from a thousand years ago, the one that had once made him suffer and whom he had deeply dreaded.

Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

True Lord of Pure Yang, Lu Chunyang.

This Sword Intent did not attack anyone. It was like an invisible blade, hovering precisely in the void, cutting off all subsequent actions Qingyuan True Lord was preparing to take to unfold the Immortal Palace's Pure Qi and cross the Sea of Worlds.

Simultaneously, it served as a clear warning, instantly illuminating this battlefield in the East Sea.

Qingyuan True Lord's expression changed drastically.

This old ghost had indeed come.

The aura of the three consecutive bursts of Pure Yang Sword Intent, and the core imprint of the Sword Intent, could not possibly escape the notice of its original master.

Especially when the final Sword of Tribulation Severance severed his killing intent chain, that pure and unadulterated Dao Rhyme of Destruction was the most conspicuous beacon.

Lu Chunyang must have sensed that his three Sword Intents had been activated and that the enemy was another True Lord like himself, which was why he had descended in person.

After all, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect prided itself on being the leader of the Righteous Path. The person who had personally bestowed the three Golden Core Sword Intents had been the one to activate them. By reason or by sentiment, Lu Chunyang would have to appear.

Qingyuan True Lord did not dare to be negligent.

Right now, his Grotto-heaven was in turmoil, his physical body was severely injured, and his strength had plummeted. To face Lu Chunyang, a mid-Nascent Soul Sword cultivator in perfect condition, would be pure suicide.

Even at his peak, he was no match for True Lord of Pure Yang.

A Sword Cultivator at the mid-Nascent Soul stage possessed terrifyingly formidable power.

Let alone the fact that he was now only at the early Nascent Soul stage.

If they were to meet head-on, the only one who would die would be himself. Unless True Lord Pudu arrived, he had no choice but to retreat, otherwise, he would meet his end right here.

Lu Chunyang might even be thrilled to once again ignite a great war between sects.

It was meaningless to entangle himself in a fight here. Forget about hunting down Xu Yunfan, he himself might die here.

"Hmph!"

Qingyuan True Lord forcefully suppressed his boundless rage, staring intently at the direction where Xu Yunfan had vanished.

Without a moment's hesitation, Qingyuan True Lord abandoned his plan to pursue using the Immortal Palace's Pure Qi. He pushed the residual Wondrous Dao True Method of Heaven and Earth's Pure Qi to its absolute limit, reaching out and tearing violently at the chaotic void before him.

"Riiip!"

A fissure was instantly torn open. Behind the fissure churned a torrent of gray-black energy, emanating a terrifying aura of devouring and annihilation.

The Sea of Worlds!

Qingyuan True Lord's figure flashed. Shrouded in the residual Pure Qi of the Immortal Palace, he plunged without hesitation into that Sea of Worlds filled with the chaotic light of creation and destruction.

He vanished inside the fissure in an instant.

Just as Qingyuan True Lord's figure plunged into the Sea of Worlds, a silhouette suddenly appeared in the sky above the East Sea.

The newcomer wore a moon-white Taoist robe. His build was not particularly imposing, and his features were not striking, but his eyes seemed to contain a vast, boundless universe of swords—deep and calm.

It was none other than the leader of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, True Lord of Pure Yang, Lu Chunyang.

He did not look at the fissure through which Qingyuan had disappeared. His gaze simply swept calmly across the battlefield, riddled with holes, like the sharpest of blades.

In the air lingered the unique sharpness left behind by the explosion of the three Sword Intents he had bestowed upon Xu Yunfan.

He stood silently for a long while, a Sword Intent for deduction coiling around him.

"Hm?"

Lu Chunyang's expression changed slightly.

He truly hadn't expected Xu Yunfan to plunge headfirst into the Sea of Worlds.

He was just about to take a step into the fissure when he suddenly stopped, turning his gaze toward the Eastern Wastes, his eyes flickering slightly.

If he were to leave the Taihua Spirit Ruins World and enter the Sea of Worlds, the Bodhi Pure Land would likely immediately have the four figures in the Eastern Wastes attain the position of the Self-Existing King Buddha. By then, the Bodhi Pure Land's actions of turning the land into a Buddha Kingdom would be unstoppable.

"I can only leave it to your fate."

Bodhi Pure Land.

A Bodhisattva, seated atop a twelve-petaled golden lotus, watched the figure lingering over the East Sea, a hint of regret flashing in his eyes.

What a pity.

If only he could have lured Lu Chunyang away, everything would have been much simpler.

True Lord Pudu of the Primordial Origin Sect alone would still be able to handle the situation.

***

The Sea of Worlds.

The chilling ripples of the Sword Intent still trembled in the void, and the shattered seawater and dissipating Immortal Palace Pure Qi were mixed together into a chaotic mess.

Xu Yunfan stood upon an escape artifact.

It was no larger than a banana leaf, but it was a Void-Crossing Vessel capable of hiding amidst the chaotic light of creation and destruction in the Sea of Worlds. His face was as pale as paper.

At this moment, the spiritual power within his body was less than a tenth of what it was at his peak. His Divine Thunder Physique was covered in a spiderweb of cracks. Worse still, the three life-saving Golden Core Sword Intents had all been used up.

He looked back. The familiar fluctuations of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World had completely vanished, replaced by the violent and chaotic currents of the Sea of Worlds, mixed with the light of creation and destruction that could annihilate life.

He forcefully suppressed the intense pain in his soul and turned his gaze to Ye Xuan, who was forcibly confined within the vessel, her face a mask of terror.

After all, in the Sea of Worlds, a Foundation Establishment cultivator who ventures out is a dead woman walking.

If Xu Yunfan hadn't refined the extraordinary artifact, the Void-Crossing Vessel, he would never have dared to take such a risk.

He glanced at the Skill Column on his Attribute Panel. The Soul Exchange from the Creation Cloud Script was still lit up.

This made him secretly heave a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, he had the Attribute Panel, an existence that transcended rules, which could ignore distance.

If it had been the Cloud Avatar Technique from the original version of the Eight Sceneries of the Divine Capital, Creation Cloud Script, he would have been completely helpless now.

Xu Yunfan looked at Ye Xuan.

"Now tell me, how exactly do we get to that coordinate you mentioned? Or would you prefer to be thrown into the Sea of Worlds?"

The fear in Ye Xuan's eyes deepened.

Once illuminated by the light of creation and destruction in the Sea of Worlds, not even reincarnation would be possible.

Although most Sword Cultivators from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect were fanatics, they were still relatively normal when faced with such a threat of death.

She gritted her teeth and quickly recited the coordinate path. It was a chaotic rift point in a realm far from the mainstream currents of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

Xu Yunfan said no more. His spiritual sense frantically urged the Void-Crossing Vessel.

This escape treasure, forged with painstaking effort, erupted with its final brilliance, struggling to navigate through the violent chaos of the Sea of Worlds. Every collision with the light of creation and destruction made the vessel's body groan under the unbearable strain.
