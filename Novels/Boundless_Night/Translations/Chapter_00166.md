**Chapter 166: The Fates of the Founding Ancestors of Various Great Sects**

"No!" Qin Ming replied, quite decisively.

Meng Xinghai was surprised. "You refused so resolutely?"

In the spacious living room, the calming incense curled up from the bronze censer, emitting a soothing fragrance that quieted the mind.

Qin Ming sighed, "The people I want to see aren't here, but most of the people I don't want to see have shown up."

Li Qingyun nodded. "Young people should be so spirited. If you don't want to see them, just refuse."

In truth, Qin Ming could already imagine some of the scenes that would unfold if he met them.

"Wang Caiwei wants to see you," a man in black came in to inform him.

"Just tell them I'm in seclusion," Qin Ming said.

Those people knew he was inside the manor; they simply wanted to see him in person.

Subsequently, Lu Zhenyi, Zheng Maoze, Zeng Yuan, and others sent messages one after another.

Qin Ming did not appear. He didn't want to witness certain people flaunting their superiority after stepping onto the Immortal Path, something he'd already witnessed in Silver Vine Town on Black-White Mountain.

"Indeed, speak your mind," Li Qingyun chuckled.

Meng Xinghai said, "Uncle Li, perhaps don't say those last four words. They're a bit too much like Cao Qianqiu's style."

Soon, Qin Ming was lost in thought. He had learned from Meng Xinghai that Cao Qianqiu, whose spiritual consciousness shone like a crimson sun, had once extended a finger in the night sky, intending to directly crush him.

Qin Ming felt a chill down his spine. He had been very low-key, keeping his talents hidden in the Divine City, blending in with the common dust. How could that still offend Cao Qianqiu?

"That makes no sense," he said, puzzled.

"He said he saw a trace of the Overlord's shadow on you," Meng Xinghai informed him.

Qin Ming's expression subtly changed. That old fellow's intuition was terrifying. He hadn't even used the Overlord's cultivation technique, yet he could discern something?

He clearly remembered the scene he'd seen in the Overlord's last testament: Cao Qianqiu, ferociously brutal, unleashed six palms that shattered the Overlord's limbs, torso, and head respectively.

The Overlord's blood, which had fallen to the ground, did not extinguish. Its spiritual radiance rose, only to be stomped into ash by that old fellow, turning the entire land into scorched earth.

One pool of blood, carrying the Overlord's intense emotional fluctuations, landed on his last testament. Cao Qianqiu sneered, and with a sweep of his hand, extinguished all spirituality within the blood.

"He's so powerful and overbearing, has he never met his match?" Qin Ming asked.

Li Qingyun's expression was grave. "The 'steel plates' he kicked were all pierced through and shattered. He's one of the prominent figures from the Outside Realm Pure Land."

Meng Xinghai nodded, his expression serious. "Currently, he is one of the foremost cultivators in the Outside Realm Pure Land!"

Qin Ming fell silent. That old fellow was simply too powerful and dangerous!

"My Martial Uncle-Grandmaster has already returned. He probably won't come out again for another ten years," Meng Xinghai said.

"Old Cao left?" Li Qingyun asked.

Meng Xinghai replied, "Not yet. Reportedly, he's going to circle Black-White Mountain."

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming felt a complete lack of security knowing Cao Qianqiu was still in the city. That old fellow acted without restraint, doing as he pleased. If he were to remember Qin Ming again, a single finger could crush him into oblivion.

Not long after, Meng Xinghai received a report from his confidant and chuckled, "Just now, he left."

Qin Ming subtly breathed a sigh of relief, then felt a strong desire to become stronger. Life in the Night Mist World was already difficult, and with old monsters like Cao Qianqiu around, he severely lacked a sense of security.

Subsequently, with Cao Qianqiu no longer the topic, the atmosphere gradually relaxed.

Qin Ming mentioned his experiences at the edge of the world, and when the two in the living room learned that he had consecutively hunted Strange Blood creatures, they were both shocked.

"Do you know the value of a portion of Strange Blood? Each portion can create an Extraordinary Person!" Meng Xinghai exclaimed.

Li Qingyun said, "Some of the old fellows in the Six Imperial Ancestral Court are probably bleeding from the heart. There's definitely an elder behind every divine creature."

Qin Ming's expression turned serious. "Aren't they simply nurturing danger by raising these demons?"

Meng Xinghai shook his head. "Not quite. They've drawn a clear line, not allowing those old demons to set foot in human habitats. The Divine Lament Plains were originally a land of chaos, not yet fully reclaimed by us. If it weren't for these captive old demons occupying the border territories and acting as a barrier, other demons would cross over at any time, leading to more village massacres, injuries, and bloodshed."

Li Qingyun examined Qin Ming's foundation. "Your foundation, I can't even judge it anymore. Perhaps the Path of Rebirth is too marginalized, and even Heaven can't stand it, so you might truly carve out a new path."

Qin Ming shook his head. "What are my current achievements? Once I reach the Outer Saint stage, further improvement will be like crossing a chasm with every step. This path is too difficult. Alas, I only have two chances for rebirth left."

Meng Xinghai said, "I think, with such a deep foundation as yours, there might be a turning point. The path ahead might not be able to stop you."

Qin Ming sighed, "How glorious the Six Imperial Ancestral Court is, possessing the legendary Six Imperial Heart Sutra, with a mature path to follow. But what did I see there? A group of emaciated old men who could only stand shoulder to shoulder with those not considered elderly from the Outside Realm Immortal Lands, yet they were significantly older!"

He truly felt a sense of crisis, because he had learned in detail that those gaunt old men, in their youth, had once shone brightly in all directions. They were all Extraordinary Persons, some even suppressing core disciples from the Outside Realm, yet they were surpassed by their opponents once they reached the second major realm.

And after enduring until the third major realm, they could only contend with the descendants of their former rivals. Such a mental journey would be unbearable for most.

Even top-tier Extraordinary Persons weren't much better off. The more glorious their early stages, the greater the sense of disparity later on. The feeling of stagnation over long periods was truly terrifying.

The most crucial thing was that someone once wanted the Six Imperial Ancestor to serve as a porter—that was incredibly horrifying!

This topic was too heavy, so Qin Ming didn't say more.

He turned to the two of them, seeking answers to other questions.

"Are the current ancestors of great sects like Tathagata, Six Imperial, Heaven-Supporting, and Jade Purity the original progenitors?"

Qin Ming had experienced things in the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, meeting Lu Zizai. While practicing the 'River Knot Sutra', in a half-dream, half-waking state, he seemed to glimpse the Six Imperial Ancestor, and behind him, a terrifying giant radiating bloody golden light within the night mist. He had too many unanswered questions.

Meng Xinghai's expression turned serious. "I believe they've all been replaced, because no one can live that long."

That was his answer. The shortest-existing ancestral courts of the various sects on the Path of Rebirth had been around for over a thousand years, while the most ancient great sects had existed for over three thousand years.

"There's also a saying that a few of the ancestors are still the original individuals," Li Qingyun said.

Meng Xinghai added, "At the very least, the Tathagata has certainly changed. They themselves have the concept of the 'Current Tathagata,' referring to the ancestor of the current era, while the 'Past Tathagata' refers to the ancestor of the past."

Li Qingyun said, "Legend has it that a special scripture once crippled more than one ancestor."

Qin Ming's heart trembled upon hearing this, guessing it was very likely the Silk Script Method!

Subsequently, the two helped Qin Ming decide where he should ultimately go, conversing until past midnight.

The next day, Yu Que, upon learning of Qin Ming's return, appeared in his room early in the morning.

"Mountain Lord, you're finally back! During your absence, little Yu Que has been living without any flavor, yearning for your return. This time, you're going to study afar, please take me with you, okay? Don't sneak off again!"

Qin Ming glanced at it askance. "I heard you were mixing with a bunch of other creatures, enjoying yourself so much you forgot to return home. Don't tell me you've taken another wife?"

"How could that be? I'm a loyal bird!" Yu Que protested. It was quite extraordinary now; its feathers were more vibrant, and its beak and claws gleamed with a crystalline luster.

Qin Ming chuckled, "Do you even believe that yourself?"

Yu Que flapped one wing against its chest. "Our Yu Que tribe only breeds once a year in early spring. During that period, I am absolutely faithful to my mate!"

Qin Ming refrained from commenting, otherwise, it would surely launch into a speech about how bird life was just like this, that it was a great husband, and its fatherly love was as vast as the sea.

Two days later, Qin Ming finally left the City Lord's Manor, assuming most of those people should have left by then.

However, coincidentally, he was on his way to meet Xu Sheng, Sister Fangfang, and Wu Zheng for a meal when he encountered Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan, who were covered in bandages, still lingering.

If Lu Zhenyi and Chen Bingyan hadn't been there as well, Qin Ming would have truly considered turning around and avoiding them. Those two had spoken up for him last time in Silver Vine Town on Black-White Mountain.

"Qin Ming, you're really not being considerate! You're on your home ground, yet you're hiding from us!" Zheng Maoze spoke up.

"Big Zheng, why are you covered in injuries?" Qin Ming asked. This was because, during his time in the Divine City, he couldn't resist slapping Zheng Dazhuang amidst a chaotic fight.

One could only say that Zheng Maoze's life-saving spiritual artifacts were formidable, exploding spiritual shields, spiritual armor, and other items, thus escaping disaster.

Zheng Maoze's face darkened upon hearing this. Recently, every time he came out to compete for opportunities, he would inexplicably have a dozen bones broken by some strange fellow. It was too miserable; he even developed a psychological trauma.

Zeng Yuan was in a similar state.

Qin Ming didn't particularly want to bother with these two and instead chatted with Lu Zhenyi and Chen Bingyan.

"Didn't you say you were in seclusion?" Wang Caiwei was also there, still lingering behind. Dressed in a black gown, her dark hair cascaded like a waterfall, and her skin was like congealed cream. She was as beautiful as ever, very fond of smiling, and her smiles were incredibly radiant and infectious.

"I just came out of seclusion today," Qin Ming replied.

Under the circumstances, he was inevitably going to treat them, choosing a lakeside restaurant in the city and calling Xu Sheng, Sister Fangfang, and Wu Zheng to join them.

Yet, even so, it couldn't stop Zheng Maoze from flaunting his superiority after stepping onto the Immortal Path, and indeed, he managed to "show off" quite effectively.

"For those from the Outside Realm, a Jade Armor Guard can serve for three generations," Zheng Maoze said, telling a cynical joke.

His meaning was clear: a Jade Armor Guard is very strong, considered quite formidable, but they find it difficult to advance further themselves. They can't keep up with their master's cultivation speed and might even be surpassed by younger cultivators on the Immortal Path. Thus, a Jade Armor Guard can serve a family for three generations.

Yu Que blinked its black, gem-like eyes and asked curiously, "Big Brother, does your family raise Jade Armor Turtles? In the end, one turtle outlives three generations of your family?"

"Whose bird is this? It really... can't talk!" Zheng Maoze wanted to slam the table.

"I live in the City Lord's Manor," Yu Que stated.

Xu Sheng interjected to smooth things over. "Brother, let's drink. Let me tell you stories from my years as a traveling merchant. You know, we often encounter corpses in the Night Mist, and occasionally, we see them alive and well in bustling cities. The consequences of that are quite terrifying. Hmm, I look at you... *hiss*, you look very familiar!"

Xu Sheng's face turned pale, seemingly stunned, and he hastily left.

Zheng Maoze stared blankly, then erupted in anger. The meal became impossible to finish, and the drinking party ended abruptly.

"Qin Ming, if you need anything, just let us know. We'll definitely help if we can," Chen Bingyan said.

Qin Ming didn't stand on ceremony. "If you discover any unique cultivation methods in the Outside Realm, please copy them for me if possible."

"Okay!" The group departed.

That evening, someone, he didn't know who, sent him a package.

Qin Ming opened it. Beneath layers of oiled paper was a book. The cover bore four large characters: Five Thunders Refine Organs.

This cultivation method was certainly not simple; he had heard of it before!

Who sent this?

Before Qin Ming could recover his senses, Meng Xinghai, with a grave expression, informed him and the still-present Li Qingyun of a secret report that had just arrived.

"This is incredible, a major piece of news! Cao Qianqiu suffered severe injuries on Black-White Mountain. This can be considered a major event that has shaken the Night Mist World!"
