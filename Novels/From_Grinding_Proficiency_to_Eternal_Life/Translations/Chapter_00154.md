# Chapter 154: Ghost Weeping Abyss

At the first hint of fish-belly white on the eastern horizon, he suddenly rose, twisting his waist and hips to assume the starting stance of Vajra Supporting the Heavens.

The scapula and ilium resonated simultaneously with the taut twang of a bowstring. The pores over his entire body opened and closed in rhythm with his breath, actually drawing in the morning dew from a radius of thirty meters and condensing it into a spiraling mist.

The instant the first wisp of purple qi pierced through the clouds, Xu Yunfan exhaled like a thunderclap.

The white streamer shooting from his nose stretched ten meters before slowly dissipating, yet his chest cavity seemed like a bottomless pit, swallowing the purple qi flowing from the east.

On his attribute panel, the proficiency notifications for the Pure Yang Qi Technique began popping up intermittently. The veins beneath his skin suddenly took on a gilded hue, as if molten gold were surging through his blood vessels.

For the past month, the Heaven Craft Fortress had continued its advance toward the Ghost Weeping Abyss. Operating without rest for twelve shichen, it had finally stabilized under the maintenance and operation of the Heaven Craft Cave disciples, managing to travel three hundred li per day.

By today, the extreme boundary of the Lingnan Dao, the Ghost Weeping Abyss, was finally visible in the distance, its silhouette appearing before the crowd.

"Senior Brother Xu! We're almost at the Ghost Weeping Abyss!"

Mo Shisan's shout came from below.

During this period, Xu Yunfan's mastery of the Heaven Craft Forging Art's mechanical ingenuity had almost completely won over Mo Shisan. There were some joints that would take Mo Shisan a long time to figure out, but Xu Yunfan would understand with just a single pointer.

Some of his brilliant, eye-opening ideas were even more astonishing, making Mo Shisan regard him as a genius.

When Xu Yunfan proposed the concept of an internal combustion engine, Mo Shisan buried himself in the Mechanism Hall day and night to research it.

Xu Yunfan put on his sweat-soaked tunic and looked down into the mist-shrouded abyss.

The crisscrossing sword marks on the cliff walls emitted a faint blue phosphorescence, having yet to fade after a hundred years of wind and rain.

"The Sect Master has ordered each hall to send a team of disciples to the Ghost Weeping Abyss in advance to scout it out."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan nodded slightly. "I need to inform Senior Brother Fu about this."

The青烟 from the quenching pool in the Forging Hall had yet to disperse when Xu Yunfan pushed the door open and almost ran into Fu Jin, who was applying flood dragon oil to the Nine-Ring Mountain Shaking Hammer.

In the sharp screech of the steel rings rubbing together, Zhan Yan pressed a scroll of yellowed maps onto the玄铁 anvil, polishing a piece of refined iron in his hand until it shone with oil.

"You're just in time."

Without looking up, Zhan Yan pointed the piece of refined iron in his hand onto the map.

"The scouting team will split into three paths to descend into the abyss. Your Senior Brother Fu will lead the elite of the Forging Hall through the eastern sword-marked secret path. Decades ago, the former Mechanism Hall Master once rode a mechanical beast down there. Now, after so many years, we don't know what the situation is down there, so naturally, we need someone to go down and scout it out first to find a place for the Heaven Craft Fortress to settle."

Xu Yunfan was just about to speak as he unfastened the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, but Fu Jin suddenly barred the door with his Nine-Ring Mountain Shaking Hammer.

"At the chen hour tomorrow, you will accompany Mo Shisan in inspecting the Xuanwu Mechanism Array."

Xu Yunfan was taken aback. He had specifically polished his Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, waiting to test just how much his current strength had grown. He never expected that Zhan Yan wouldn't even ask him, just directly assigning him a task.

"Master, I think I can go down and scout with Senior Brother Fu."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but glance at the solemn-faced Fu Jin. He was confident that even without activating the Lin State, his current strength was not inferior to Fu Jin's.

Zhan Yan shook his head slightly. "The matter is already decided. There's no need for you to say more."

Fu Jin reached out and patted Xu Yunfan's shoulder.

"It's not a big job. Just stay well in the sect. That Ghost Weeping Abyss sounds scary, but it's just the sound of the wind howling through the canyon, echoing and creating wailing noises."

"Master Mo has already given us the detailed information. We're just going to take a look at the terrain and find a place for the Heaven Craft Fortress to settle."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan no longer insisted. When he reached the corridor bridge, his eyes flashed as he saw Qi Huan standing in the scouting team, standing silently without a word.

Ever since the External Affairs Hall got entangled with the Incense Fire Cult, and the Hall Master of the Hidden Blade Pavilion, Bao Yan, was revealed to be a spy sent by the Great Zhou Imperial Court, this incident had dealt a huge blow to Qi Huan. At the same time, because he was Bao Yan's true disciple, he was gradually marginalized in the Heaven Craft Cave and pushed out of the core circle.

The once high-spirited Qi Huan, who was regarded as the number one among the young true disciples of the Heaven Craft Cave, had become silent and withdrawn in recent days.

This was inevitable. The Hall Master's betrayal had almost brought the entire Heaven Craft Cave to ruin. As a disciple, he would inevitably be seen as bearing some joint responsibility.

Qi Huan noticed Xu Yunfan's gaze, but his expression remained unchanged, his eyes still lowered, silent and motionless.

Xu Yunfan leaned on the bronze railing and looked down into the abyss. Four teams of Heaven Craft Cave disciples were rapidly descending on玄铁 sliding platforms.

The bronze winches emitted a harsh sound of metal meshing. More than a hundred black-clothed disciples carrying mechanism boxes landed and instantly transformed into a torrent of iron, advancing in four directions along the cliff walls.

The eastern team unfolded folding ladders and fixed them into the phosphorescent sword marks, while the western team set up water dragon crossbows aimed at the fissures. The clicking sounds of gears meshing during their movements even suppressed the strong winds from the abyss.

A group of ten-plus nine-zhang-tall mechanical birds swept through the mist. The iron wings supported by the玄钢 skeletons were as large as war chariots.

At the root of each bird's wing was embedded a compressed airbag improved by Mo Shisan. Wherever the玄晶 eyepieces scanned, the phosphorescent powder from the wingtips left a trail of fluorescent blue in the mist.

The leading mechanical bird suddenly dove, launching thirty-six ground-probing spindles from beneath its wings. When the tungsten steel drill heads struck the rock layer, the resulting sparks formed a red web in the abyss. If there were any movement below, it would be detected immediately to provide an early warning.

The hundred-zhang-high玄钢 walls of the Heaven Craft Fortress were crushing the ancient Sword Gate path. Sixteen玄钢 spider legs were inserted nearly thirty zhang into the rock layers. Each pile was carved with the shock-absorbing structure designed by Mo Han. Amidst the roaring of steam, the billowing white steam even boiled the surrounding vegetation.

At the bottom of the fortress, three hundred and sixty玄铁 hubs meshed with the transmission chains. The white mist steaming between the axles was the condensed steam from the condensing device developed by the former Mechanism Hall Master, swallowing and spewing geothermal energy.

Such a earth-shaking commotion made the seven warlord cavalry troops trailing behind stay warily thirty li away, looking at this moving fortress with wary expressions. Many martial world adventurers also came along to watch the spectacle, and quite a crowd had gathered.

If they didn't know this was the Heaven Craft Cave relocating its sect, if such a fortress approached a city to attack it, it wouldn't take two shichen to bring a city to its knees.

Moving from Yanbei Dao to the southwest Lingnan Dao, the Heaven Craft Fortress's journey was extremely conspicuous. If the Empress hadn't failed in her great undertaking and had no energy to spare for the Heaven Craft Cave, it would have been difficult to travel so smoothly.

The other dao and prefectures were constantly testing the Empress's reaction, wanting to carve out territories and declare themselves kings.

Now, heroes rise everywhere. Although the Heaven Craft Fortress is incredibly coveted, as possessing such a fortress would unleash unimaginable power on the battlefield, the Heaven Craft Cave has countless mechanisms, and it's not easy to approach. Plus, there's a Marrow Cleansing Grandmaster holding the fort; otherwise, such a massive target would have been used for target practice long ago.

Crossing two dao regions to reach the Ghost Weeping Abyss in Shu Prefecture of Lingnan Dao, the relocation of the Heaven Craft Cave is known to all under heaven.
