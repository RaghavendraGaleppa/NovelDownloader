Chapter 93: Do I Not Look Like a Good Person?

"Hmph!"

Entering the Yama Palace once more, Butian Peak Master's expression grew even uglier. His body of earth and stone continuously shed sand and gravel, as if it would collapse at any moment.

"To force me to this extent!"

Butian Peak Master exhaled deeply, suppressing numerous emotions. Along with his breath, the "Grand Dao Diagram of Yin and Yang" that had manifested in the air returned to his brow.

The next second, he parted his lips and teeth, exhaling like thunder:

"Geng Jin is the Great White of the heavens, bringing forth killing and robust strength. Robust when meeting water, its Qi flows clear; strong when meeting fire, its Qi is pure and sharp, referred to as Shang Zhang!"

The heavenly sound was clear and resounding, instantly shaking the heavens and earth. Lu Yang looked up, seeing nothing but vast golden light, blazing fiercely and difficult to behold directly. Only by probing with his spiritual sense could he vaguely discern a majestic white tiger, colossal and imposing, sitting atop mountains and ridges, staring intently at him.

"Roar!"

A tiger's roar caused rolling sandstorms to fall from the sky, formless and insubstantial yet heavy as ten thousand pounds, as if countless blades instantly slashed down upon the Yama Palace!

Outside Skeleton Mountain, Daoist Hongyun's eyebrows instantly shot up at the sight: "It's actually the Sitting Mountain Lord. He cultivated Shang Zhang among the Heavenly Gang positions?"

"That old monster Chen Taihe must really be pushed to his limit. He's hidden his Dao Path for so many years, unwilling to reveal it, and now it's finally accidentally exposed!"

Only after cultivators reach Foundation Establishment are they truly considered to have entered the Dao. After that begins the long path to Golden Core Dao Fruit. However, the heavens and earth have their numbers, and Dao Fruits are no exception; each Golden Core Dao Fruit is unique. The 'Dao Path' leading to a Dao Fruit is also unique, and once exposed, others can immediately deduce it.

Therefore, for cultivators, their Dao Path is a top secret. Otherwise, if known, the opponent could make targeted arrangements to obstruct your Dao Path. Even worse, if the Dao Fruit pointed to by your Dao Path already has a True Lord... The Witch Ghost Dao serves as a grim example.

However, on the other hand, the 'Dao Path' itself is also a powerful weapon for Foundation Establishment True Persons in combat, precisely because it is formed by collecting the Heavenly Gangs and Earthly Fiends.

Heaven is the stem, Earth is the branch. The intersection of stems and branches is where the Golden Core Dao Fruit resides.

To form a 'Dao Path', one needs to gather ten Heavenly Gangs and twelve Earthly Fiends, taking both their Yin and Yang aspects, totaling four great medicines. Obtaining one medicine signifies Mid-Foundation Establishment, three signify Late-Foundation Establishment, and all four signify Perfected Foundation Establishment, with the Grand Dao complete and ready to seek the Golden Core Fruit.

"The Sitting Mountain Lord belongs to 'Shang Zhang' among the Ten Heavenly Gangs. And a Dao Path starting with 'Shang Zhang'... it seems the Dao Fruit Chen Taihe intends to achieve is one of these six: Roadside Earth, Hairpin Gold, Pine and Cypress Wood, Pomegranate Wood, White Wax Gold, or Wall Earth!"

Daoist Hongyun's gaze was sharp, silently calculating in his heart.

Just then, a damp mist suddenly permeated the heavens and earth, accompanied by the sound of surging waves. Finally, it transformed into a red, human-faced mermaid. With a human face and a voice like mandarin ducks, it lashed its tail in the air, turning the void into a tidal wave that crashed thunderously against the Yama Palace, causing the entire Yama Palace to shake violently, almost disintegrating. The Yin soldiers and ghost generals guarding the Yama Palace scattered in large numbers.

"It's the Chiru Scale!" Daoist Hongyun immediately concluded, "Shen Jin is robust when meeting the Moon Branch, Water and Earth find longevity in this palace... Is he seeking 'Tun Tan' for the Earthly Fiend position?"

"Shang Zhang, Tun Tan... he aims for the Pomegranate Wood Dao Fruit!"

Boom!

At that moment, with a loud bang, Butian Peak Master finally broke through the Yama Palace again, riding the human-faced fish transformed from the Chiru, and instantly vanished from his spot.

However, his expression at this moment was utterly livid.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

Although he aimed for Pomegranate Wood, he had always kept it well-hidden, never revealing his true intentions, to avoid being known by True Persons who had chosen the same Dao Path as him.

But now, everything was exposed. All cultivators in the world seeking Pomegranate Wood would henceforth regard him as a thorn in their side. If someone was a step ahead of him on the Dao Path, that would be one thing, but what he feared most were those who, like him, were also in Mid-Foundation Establishment. That would truly be an irreconcilable feud.

As soon as he thought of this, killing intent surged in Butian Peak Master's heart.

At the same time, Lu Yang also revealed himself, letting out a helpless sigh: "Pseudo-Foundation Establishment is still a bit inferior compared to true Foundation Establishment."

Moreover, the disparity between different Foundation Establishment cultivators also startled Lu Yang. He was fighting Butian Peak Master, who had less than one-tenth of his strength remaining due to the Golden Core sword qi, at his full power. It was like kicking a man when he was down. Yet, he still hadn't killed the opponent.

He had thought the overall situation was settled, but the Sitting Mountain Lord and Chiru Scale that Butian Peak Master suddenly displayed greatly broadened Lu Yang's horizons.

"But I can't just let him escape like this."

Lu Yang's mind stirred. The fragmented Yama Palace expanded again, its gates opening and closing, intending to capture the recently escaped Butian Peak Master back. This was the wonder of the Yama Palace. Within the eight hundred li of Skeleton Mountain, no soul could escape its grasp. If Butian Peak Master had a physical body, capturing him might have been much more troublesome. But with only his soul remaining?

One grab, one catch!

Boom!

The sound of the gates opening and closing was like thunder exploding, rolling through the air. Butian Peak Master immediately turned back, his face showing an unspeakable look of humiliation. The next second, he didn't hesitate, forming a sword-finger and slashing.

*Chirps—!*

A sharp screeching sound erupted from Butian Peak Master's soul. Then, amidst flying sparks and electricity, Butian Peak Master's soul was split in two!

Lu Yang was momentarily stunned at the sight: "This is... the Heavenly Silkworm Secret of Severing Thoughts to See the Self?"

But on second thought, it made sense. The Heavenly Silkworm Secret of Severing Thoughts was a great divine ability mastered by Chen Xin'an, so it was perfectly normal for Butian Peak Master, as his father, to know it.

After Butian Peak Master split in two, one half resolutely lunged towards the Yama Palace, using itself as a shield to block Lu Yang's pursuit, while his true body, riding the human-faced great fish transformed from the Chiru Scale, vanished in a few flashes, fleeing beyond the boundaries of the eight hundred li Skeleton Mountain.

"Cutting off the tail to survive? So decisive, worthy of a True Person of the Sacred Sect."

Lu Yang frowned slightly, but his actions were swift. He activated the Yama Palace, suppressing it directly and accepting the divine avatar that Butian Peak Master had thrown into the net. Immediately after, he absorbed it into the Myriad Spirit Banner.

Refined in an instant!

"Pfft!"

The next second, Butian Peak Master, who had just escaped to safety and was planning to summon back his avatar, suddenly spat out a mouthful of soul essence, turning back with a vengeful gaze.

Lu Yang, however, was unfazed. He returned to the main seat of the Yama Palace, forming a hand seal. The earth veins of the eight hundred li Skeleton Mountain immediately surged with Yin Qi, pouring in like sweet dew. Wherever it passed, the Yama Palace's injuries disappeared, and it appeared that it would be fully restored within a few months at most!

This was also the advantage of the Yama Palace. Because the Pseudo-Foundation Establishment was based on the Skeleton Mountain's earth veins, with the nourishment of the earth veins, the recovery speed of injuries was much faster than that of ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Compared to him, Butian Peak Master was in a miserable state. First, his physical body was destroyed, then he fought a great battle with Lu Yang, suffering damage to his Dao foundation and his soul splitting. It would be impossible for him to recover without three or four decades.

"Butian Peak Master is, after all, a True Person of the Sacred Sect. If I truly kill him, I won't benefit either. Injuring him severely, that previous finger strike was just collecting some interest."

When I truly break through to Foundation Establishment, then I'll settle accounts with him!

Thinking this, Lu Yang calmed down, leaning back against the Yama Palace, his gaze cold as he watched Butian Peak Master and Daoist Hongyun outside Skeleton Mountain.

However, he soon noticed that Daoist Hongyun's expression was off. He looked grave, staring up at the sky, completely devoid of the calm composure Lu Yang had seen before. Between his brows, a strong sense of hatred even shone through.

Someone was coming?

The next second, Lu Yang saw a mass of shimmering light rolling through the sky from the horizon. Wherever it passed, it illuminated the colorful clouds, revealing a heroic man clad in armor and bearing weapons. The man's appearance was not particularly handsome, but he possessed an innate bearing, his brows soaring. Though he had a middle-aged countenance, he carried the sharpness of youth. A profound light shot up from the crown of his head, which was the manifestation of his 'Dao Path', completely unhidden. The four great medicines within the profound light were clearly visible.

"Chongguang...!!!"

Daoist Hongyun gritted his teeth. This person was his greatest adversary within the Sacred Sect, simply because the Lamp Flame Dao Fruit he sought had once been his. The enmity of Dao struggle was irreconcilable! What angered him even more was that with the passage of time, he had already fallen from his Dao Fruit position, and surprisingly, he was no match for this junior when they truly fought.

"...Hmph!"

With a cold snort, Daoist Hongyun directly vanished from his spot, clearly unwilling to meet the other person. The heroic man in the sky likewise ignored him. His gaze fell, first sweeping over the battered Butian Peak Master, then landing on Lu Yang, revealing a satisfied smile.

The next second, Lu Yang heard a voice: "May I ask, fellow Daoist, which True Person of my Sacred Sect has returned in reincarnation?"

Lu Yang: "..."

Wait, why does everyone think I'm a disciple of the Sacred Sect? Do I not look like a good person?
