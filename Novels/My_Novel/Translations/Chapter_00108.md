Chapter 108: Divine Archery, White Snake in the Mist

An arrow flew through the air with lightning speed.

Zheng Xuezhang broke out in a cold sweat, terror-stricken. He raised his palm to grab the arrow but felt he had no certainty of success. He wanted to turn and dodge, yet his body felt sluggish and stuck.

This was a "premeditated arrow."

Li Xian had poured his very intent and spirit into the arrow the moment he drew the string. The gallantry of that shot was beyond words.

"Damn it!"

Zheng Xuezhang squeezed his horse with his legs, sank his waist, and leaned back, performing a backflip in midair. At the same time, he grabbed the horse's tail with his rear hand and threw his beloved steed directly at the arrow.

He used the horse's flesh and blood as a shield to slow the arrow's momentum, but the arrow's force was too fierce to be stopped. The horse was pierced instantly, fell to the ground, and let out a cry before breathing its last.

In his panic, Zheng Xuezhang didn't have time to think. He planted his feet and continuously waved his palms, moving so fast the naked eye could hardly follow. He hoped to use the wind from his palms to weaken the arrow's force and dissolve the "intent" within it.

Zheng Xuezhang's heart pounded like thunder, thumping wildly, and blue veins bulged on his forehead. Seeing the arrow approach, he had an impulse to turn and run. But if he did, his spirit would be broken, and if Li Xian shot a second arrow, he would be in an even worse state.

In an instant, many thoughts flashed through his mind. In the end, he threw caution to the wind. Gathering his Qi, he let out a great roar and grabbed at the oncoming arrow with both hands.

*Thud!* Zheng Xuezhang was thrown back more than ten steps, crashing into a large tree. The arrow still broke through his defenses and shot into his chest.

However...

"Ptui!"

Zheng Xuezhang spat out a mouthful of blood and took out a breastplate, laughing wildly. "Fine archery, fine archery! But a pity, the arrow is mediocre!"

It turned out that this arrow could have shattered the breastplate and taken his life directly. Unfortunately, the wooden arrow was of ordinary quality. When the arrowhead struck the breastplate, it shattered into dust.

"Little bastard, give me your life!"

Zheng Xuezhang snapped the arrow in half and charged swiftly toward Li Xian. Li Xian thought to himself, "As expected, it was still a bit lacking." He drew the string again for a second arrow.

"Dad, your sword!" shouted a surviving son.

Zheng Xuezhang was stunned. He had been intimidated by Li Xian's intent and had completely forgotten the great sword on his back. Reminded of this, he immediately unsheathed it and held it before him.

Li Xian turned his arrow and shot coldly at the son who had just spoken. A scream rang out, and another life was extinguished by the arrow.

"My son!" Zheng Xuezhang's eyes turned bloodshot. "I will capture this boy, make him wish he were dead, and avenge you all!"

With heavy casualties and no way to retreat, seeing his beloved sons die one after another, his ferocity surged. Filled with killing intent, he charged up the mountain with his sword.

The mountain path was winding, and Li Xian stood at the summit, looking down from above.

This path up the mountain was like an invisible barrier. With him holding the bow alone, he possessed the spirit of one man defending a pass against ten thousand foes.

The sound of whistling wind rose as Zheng Xuezhang, his martial arts formidable, utilized his lightness technique to the fullest. He leaped and bounded, moving like a gibbon or a golden leopard, his speed uncannily fast.

Li Xian remained calm in the face of danger and shot with precision.

Zheng Xuezhang parried with his sword. But since he held the sword with his hand, his fingers were exposed. Against Li Xian's divine shooting, they were surely doomed!

"This boy's archery is strangely good. If I keep dodging, how can I kill him?" Zheng Xuezhang's mind raced. He changed his parrying stance and slammed his great sword into the ground.

Stones flew everywhere. He swept the flat of the blade, sending countless pebbles and yellow dust hurtling toward Li Xian.

The attack was truly formidable.

Each stone possessed terrifying power. Li Xian had no choice but to retract his bow and dodge. But with stones raining down from all directions, how could he avoid them all?

A stone struck his left shoulder, embedding itself in his flesh. Li Xian shook his body lightly, forcing the stone out of his meat.

He continued to draw his bow and shoot.

Zheng Xuezhang tried the same trick again. But this arrow was already loosed, shooting off one of his fingers.

Back at the One Union Manor, he had already lost a palm and several fingers. He could continue to hold his sword not through finger strength, but by吸附ing it with the Qi in his palm.

But without fingers, he couldn't execute his exquisite swordsmanship. Thus, his strength was severely limited. Losing another finger now was no different from losing a son.

Zheng Xuezhang let out a miserable scream and dared not charge forward anymore. He looked around and suddenly saw a large boulder. He immediately used his lightness technique to hide behind it, panting heavily.

He tried to calm himself.

He couldn't help but think, "I have truly miscalculated. This boy is merely a guard, how could he possess such terrifying archery? My martial arts are high, but I cannot withstand his arrows. If I cannot get close, how can I capture him?"

He was at a complete loss.

Li Xian said coldly, "Old thief Xuezhang, do you think hiding behind a rock means I can't hit you?" The arrow flew again.

His archery had already reached its peak, deeply understanding the thousand changes of the bow and arrow. When an arrow leaves the bow, due to its length, the head, body, and tail sway like a wave.

With the right force and angle, the arrow could curve horizontally after leaving the string, bypassing obstacles to hit the target.

This arrow was loosed.

Zheng Xuezhang's scalp went numb. By the time he noticed, it was too late to dodge. The arrow划过 a horizontal arc and shot before him. He raised his hand to block, but the arrow pierced through his palm and into his right eyeball.

However, such curving arrows had a drawback: their power was insufficient.

Zheng Xuezhang screamed and dared not stay behind the rock anymore. He immediately fled, scrambling desperately into the forest. Finding a larger cover, he hid himself once more.

"Boss, we'll clear the way for you! Let's fight him!" shouted the elite Black Water Gang members in unison.

They swarmed up the mountain, using their lives to block the arrows. Li Xian frowned slightly, not expecting them to be so loyal to Zheng Xuezhang.

They were far different from common mountain bandits.

He immediately showed no mercy. Anyone who stepped onto the mountain path was killed with a single arrow. After killing dozens in a row, the path was littered with corpses, and blood flowed like a river, a scene of extreme tragedy.

Li Xian reached for his quiver again and found it empty. The Black Water Gang's attack was sudden, and he didn't have many arrows. A gang member shouted excitedly, "Boss, he's out of arrows!"

Hearing this, Zheng Xuezhang tremblingly poked his head out. Seeing Li Xian's longbow aimed at him, his whole body shuddered, and he quickly retreated deep into his cover.

He had been scared out of his wits.

But after calming down, remembering that Li Xian's bow was indeed empty, he gathered his courage and looked out again.

He saw Li Xian had put away his bow and instead drawn a long sword.

"Hahaha, Li Xian, you little bastard! Without your bow and arrow, let's see how I'll kill you!" Zheng Xuezhang laughed and used his lightness technique to rush toward the mountain path.

He had been accumulating anger for a long time, and his killing intent was as solid as substance. His blood and Qi circulated too fast, his chest heaving like thunder with a rumbling sound, truly terrifying.

Li Xian drew his blade and executed the Great Luo Sword Style. He slashed horizontally and vertically, forcing the Black Water Gang members back so they couldn't get close.

Zheng Xuezhang charged to the front, seeing Li Xian had no path of retreat. He laughed loudly and reached out to grab Li Xian's arms, intending to tear them off.

Suddenly, Li Xian leaned back and fell straight down the mountain. Zheng Xuezhang was stunned and looked down... Li Xian's feet were hooked to a vine, and he was swinging toward the distance.

He had already prepared a way out!

"Damn it!" Zheng Xuezhang stomped on the vine, snapping it. Li Xian had nothing to hang onto and was about to crash to the ground. At that moment, he shot out both legs, executing the "Breeze Leg Style" and utilizing the mystery of the "Light" character. His falling momentum greatly decreased.

[Breeze Legs]
[Mastery: 21/50000, Peak Perfection!]

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew.

Li Xian's "Riding the Wind" trait also activated, and he actually floated upward a bit, walking on the wind! He finally landed on a large tree and fled into the distance.

Zheng Xuezhang was both shocked and terrified. He thought that this boy's archery was terrifying, and it had been hard work to exhaust his arrows. If he wasn't killed now, there would be endless trouble in the future. He immediately leaped from the mountain summit.

He had practiced lightness techniques. But it was only the most superficial "Water Skimming Technique," a skill for river surfaces, not enough to allow him to maneuver in the air.

However, the foundation of his transformed body was still there. He used his lightness technique to slow his fall partially, then took the impact with his physical body. When he hit the ground, his internal organs ached, his lungs bled, and he spat out a mouthful of blood foam.

His feet were deeply embedded in the ground, and his knee joints were dislocated, as if he had suffered a heavy blow.

Zheng Xuezhang shook his body, and after a series of cracks and pops, his dislocated bones all returned to place.

"Brat, you still run!"

Li Xian was rushing ahead, and Zheng Xuezhang was chasing fiercely behind. Zheng Xuezhang had practiced lightness techniques, so his speed was far superior. Although Li Xian's [Breeze Legs] had been practiced for months and were already at [Peak Perfection], they were ultimately a leg style, not a lightness technique.

In the Great Wu Dynasty... martial arts were precious. And "lightness technique" was even more precious, extremely difficult to obtain.

But Li Xian was not without his advantages. Whenever he encountered an uphill climb, no matter how steep the terrain, he could easily翻越 it. Then, with a leap, utilizing the mystery of the "Light" character, he would pull away from Zheng Xuezhang again.

Relying on the complex terrain and the rising and falling slopes...

In this way, it became a cycle.

Zheng Xuezhang was clearly extremely powerful, yet he could do nothing to Li Xian. Li Xian circled with him for a long time without suffering any loss.

Li Xian provoked him, "Old thief Xuezhang, how does the taste of losing your sons feel?" Zheng Xuezhang said, "Hmph, so what if I lost sons? Once I capture you and turn you into a human sail, I can father three or four more in the future, with a whole clan of descendants!"

Li Xian said, "Is that so? The deer dies, who knows whose hand it will be in." (Meaning: It's not over until it's over.)

Zheng Xuezhang roared, "Arrogant!" and chased with all his might. The two had been locked in a struggle all night, and now the dawn broke, a sliver of fish-belly white appearing on the horizon.

"Expert swimmers die in the woods, old thief. For you to venture so deep, I'm afraid you won't be returning," Li Xian laughed.

"Spouting nonsense!" Zheng Xuezhang was furious, then suddenly froze. In the dim morning light, he saw that this place was shrouded in heavy, highly toxic mountain miasma, obscuring his vision.

In his pursuit, he had unknowingly lost his way and was trapped within the miasma.

Zheng Xuezhang thought, "Not good! This boy is cunning. He deliberately lured me here. I was blinded by anger and unfamiliar with the terrain, and I never realized it!"

Regret arose in his heart. He wanted to turn back, but he didn't know where he was. Every breath of miasma burned his lungs like fire. The situation was dire.

"Damn it! Even if I die, I'm taking you with me!" Zheng Xuezhang knew survival was unlikely, and his killing intent became purer. A blood mist shook from his body, and his speed increased once more.

Li Xian recognized this move. It seemed to be called the "Blood Mist Technique," which consumed one's blood and Qi to enhance strength. He was already on guard. Using the thick fog for cover, he dodged left and right, refusing to engage in a direct clash.

Zheng Xuezhang was frantic and helpless, despair creeping in. With heaven-defying skills, he had nowhere to use them and was about to be worn to death in the forest. Li Xian picked fruits along the way to counteract the miasma's poison.

But he couldn't stay long.

"Not good!"

The forest was filled with thick fog, and Li Xian's vision was also obstructed. As he ran through the woods, he suddenly saw a giant snake blocking the path ahead.

The snake was snow-white all over, its tongue flicking in and out. It was perfectly hidden in the miasma. If one wasn't careful, they would be sent right into its mouth.

Li Xian never ventured deep into the miasma zone. If Zheng Xuezhang hadn't been chasing him so relentlessly with his abnormal vitality, he wouldn't have entered this place to trap and kill him.

He immediately forced a change in direction. But this caused a momentary slowdown. Zheng Xuezhang seized the opportunity and rushed forward, striking out with both palms.
