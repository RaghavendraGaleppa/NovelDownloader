# Chapter 103: Reunion with the Blacksmith Hu

The bright moon hung over the mountain forest. Although Zhou Qing had newly mastered his flying sword and five innate masters were setting out together, the final outcome would only be known when they encountered the Sky Wolf.

Each demonic beast possessed different abilities. For instance, the rooster Mao Ri could ignite bonfires.

"It smells delicious," someone remarked.

The leopard they were eating had been hunted by Xiao Ruowang.

Fusong nodded in agreement, "The bonfire lit with Solar True Fire indeed gives the meat a unique flavor—it completely brings out the aroma."

Zhang Jingxiu suggested, "Should we gather some spirit wood for roasting? The taste would surely be even better."

"Old Zhang, that's a fine idea," Fusong approved.

Xiao Ruowang nodded blankly.

Zhou Qing sat cross-legged in meditation, abstaining from the meat. As he approached the perfection of the Innate Realm, his Qi, body, and spirit were all nearing their current limits. Ordinary food offered him no benefits beyond satisfying his appetite.

Normally, according to Qinglingzi's description, after reaching the ninth layer of Qi Refinement, one could establish a Dao Foundation—what ancient Qi Refiners called Foundation Establishment. But for Zhou Qing, it wasn't so simple.

"My Great Dao Foundation clearly requires a supreme technique that unifies Qi, body, and spirit to establish, not merely Qi Refinement."

"Before that, I must first achieve the perfection of the Innate Realm—the perfection of Qi, body, and spirit."

Zhou Qing somewhat understood why the beast hide mentioned the tenth layer of Qi Refinement as a legendary realm. Pure Qi Refinement alone could never reach that stage.

The tenth layer of Qi Refinement represented the perfection of the Innate Realm, where Qi, body, and spirit all reached their post-Innate limits. Zhou Qing had inadvertently pushed his physical limits further by practicing the Heart Fire Thunder technique.

However, without the Great Mulberry Tree's Yin energy, practicing Heart Fire Thunder became increasingly dangerous, easily harming himself.

In truth, from the moment he began practicing the Five Viscera Exercises, Zhou Qing had benefited from the Great Mulberry Tree's Yin energy, supplemented by elixirs, to complete the cultivation of the Five Viscera Thunder Resonance.

He and the Great Mulberry Tree complemented each other—one Yang, one Yin; one active, one still.

The emergence of the Demon Seed Gestation Art was merely the icing on the cake.

"With the flying sword, my combat power has indeed improved, but to achieve true perfection in cultivation, I must still rely on the power of nature."

Zhou Qing was well aware that after clearing the demonic beasts from the forbidden depths of the mountains, apart from the occasional emergence of demons, his true adversaries in this mortal realm were the forces of nature itself.

And the demons would have to be far more formidable than the Ghost Vine to pose a threat.

This was an idea he had conceived two years prior—to use the ocean tides for cultivation.

---

After slaying the Sky Wolf, the remaining demonic beasts, unless particularly powerful, would be left to Zhang Jingxiu and the others. Zhou Qing intended to cultivate amidst the ocean tides to achieve Innate perfection and comprehend a supreme technique that fused Qi, body, and spirit.

By then, whether he established his Dao Foundation or not, it would be time to visit the cave abode of Master Jingyang.

Because at that point, there would be nothing left for him to improve upon.

After eating and resting for the night, Zhou Qing and his companions finally reached the deepest part of the Western Mountains.

---

"Strange, I don't sense any demonic beasts," Fusong muttered.

"Stay alert, everyone. Danger approaches," Zhou Qing said gravely, his spiritual senses extended.

He could feel a looming threat, though his eyes saw nothing. Gradually, a thin mist began to envelop them.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Heavy footsteps approached.

Without hesitation, Zhou Qing unleashed his Cloud-Parting Palm.

A massive beast, several zhang tall, materialized before them. Zhang Jingxiu and the others immediately attacked.

"A white Sky Wolf," Zhou Qing observed, recognizing its appearance.

According to reports from the Demon-Slaying Division's scouts, the demonic beast they had seen was over ten zhang long. This white wolf didn't match that description. But Zhou Qing wasn't surprised—Innate experts could expand their bodies using Qi and blood, and demonic beasts could do the same.

However, maintaining such a form wasn't sustainable, and it sacrificed agility and flexibility.

The four Innate masters struck the white wolf simultaneously, producing a thunderous impact.

The beast howled, sending the four flying back.

Seizing the moment, Zhou Qing retreated and drew his Thunderbolt Bow, firing an arrow.

To his shock, the arrow—crafted from mulberry wood—was caught in the wolf's jaws.

"Incredible reflexes."

But Zhou Qing had coated the arrowhead with venom from his small snake. Though the wolf snapped the arrow, it wasn't unharmed.

The beast staggered slightly, visibly affected.

With a flick of his sleeve, Zhou Qing launched the small snake using the Enchanting Daoist's hidden weapon technique. The "Green Snake in the Sleeve" shot forth like a venomous dragon, biting the wolf's nose.

Enraged, the wolf shook its head violently, flinging the snake away.

Zhou Qing seized the opportunity to retreat further, unsheathing his Ironwood Sword and thrusting it toward the wolf's eye.

"Piercing Moon!"

Using the flying sword to execute Piercing Moon drastically increased its speed.

The sword plunged into the wolf's eye, eliciting a roar of pain.

"Scatter, everyone!" Zhou Qing shouted.

He knew that after striking a vital point, the wolf would frenzy. A terrifying aura enveloped him.

---

"Pay respects to the Divine Lord!"

"The Divine Lord has returned!" A burly man with a thick beard exclaimed excitedly.

Mao Ri tilted its head, looking confused.

"Brother Hu, it's been years."

"Master Zhou," one of the temple guardians replied—none other than Blacksmith Hu.

Mao Ri clearly remembered Hu as the one who had captured it from the mountains. It proudly flapped onto Hu's shoulder.

Hu chuckled awkwardly, not daring to provoke the rooster.

The third guardian was a short man entwined with small snakes.

None of the three possessed high martial prowess; Hu had the strongest Qi and blood.

Through questioning, Zhou Qing learned the other two guardians were descendants of disciples once taught by Master Jingyang. They had originally lived in a village but were pursued by the Martial Virtue Department, scattering until only these two remained.

Hu had been a spy sent by the Martial Virtue Department to infiltrate the village, stealing a beast hide and a Qi Refinement manual left by Master Jingyang.

The manual was meant for Qi Refinement, but Hu, misunderstanding its contents, practiced incorrectly and suffered the consequences.

Eventually, the two guardians found Hu and brought him deep into the mountains. When the Martial Virtue Department pursued them again, Hu had a change of heart, risking his life to save the two. The trio then settled in this temple connected to Master Jingyang, becoming its guardians.

The Martial Virtue Department commander who had hunted them was a lone operative—the same Southern Commander Gu Fan whom Zhou Qing had killed. With Gu's death, that trail ended.

The temple enshrined a majestic divine rooster.

According to the guardians, this rooster was the Divine Lord. At the end of each life, it would burst into flames, revert to an ordinary spirit bird, and gradually regrow.

Their duty was to protect the Divine Lord as it matured.

Unexpectedly, the Divine Lord had gone missing.

The snake keeper had once sent out tamed spirit snakes to search, but none returned.

Zhou Qing confirmed that the small snake in his sleeve wasn't one of the keeper's. The fate of the others, he ignored.

The temple retained the divine aura of Mao Ri's previous incarnation, deterring demonic beasts from approaching.

Zhou Qing also obtained the Qi Refinement manual Hu had stolen.

"Greenwood Sword Art: To master this art, one must cultivate the Evergreen Immortality Technique, establish a Dao Foundation, forge Sword Qi, and slay demons with unstoppable might."

Zhou Qing's expression turned odd. This was no simple Qi Refinement manual—it was a sword art meant to complement Qi Refinement. That Hu had practiced it blindly without dying was sheer luck.

---

"Brother Hu, if you don't mind, let me check your pulse."

Hu obliged, well aware of Zhou Qing's current prowess. Years ago, fearing the guardians or the Martial Virtue Department would seize the beast hide and leave him no way out, Hu had left it with Zhou Qing before fleeing into the mountains with the two guardians.

"This is... True Qi!"

A sharp energy invaded Zhou Qing's body.

He quickly realized why Hu hadn't killed himself practicing incorrectly: Hu possessed an Immortal Physique. But the sword art required the Evergreen Immortality Technique to function properly.

Hu's haphazard practice had only produced faint traces of sword-like True Qi—and in meager amounts. His body, however, was already riddled with damage.

Zhou Qing hadn't expected Hu to be the Immortal Physique he sought, nor that Hu would waste his innate talent so thoroughly.

Most martial artists spent their lives striving to break through to the Innate Realm and cultivate True Qi. Before Zhou Qing's time, only two Innate masters existed: the Grassland Warlord and the old eunuch.

Yet Hu could naturally cultivate True Qi.

With proper guidance and techniques, his path to immortality would have been far smoother than even Qinglingzi's, who had inherited predecessors' legacies.

Such divine favor, squandered unwittingly.

Hu's greatest issue now was his ruined body. Though the True Qi he cultivated was minimal, it had drained his Qi and blood.

Lacking Zhou Qing's spiritual talent and being much older—unlike Zhou Qing during his developmental years—Hu couldn't recover through exercises like the Five Animal Play.

Zhou Qing didn't reveal the truth, only advising Hu that the technique harmed him and should be abandoned.

He persuaded Hu to leave with him. The other two guardians, shocked to hear the Great Zhou Dynasty had fallen, chose to remain out of habit.

Zhou Qing didn't object.

Mao Ri wandered the temple, emerging with its feathers imbued with a mysterious aura, though still seeming dazed.

Zhou Qing gleaned some temple secrets, though not many. The temple had been built for Mao Ri's previous incarnation. What astonished Zhou Qing was Mao Ri's ability to reincarnate—was its true form a phoenix?

It didn't resemble one. Nor did it match the temple's portraits exactly.

It bore traits of both the Golden Crow and the Divine Lord, suggesting its appearance changed with each incarnation. Perhaps in one life, it would resemble the Golden Crow of esoteric paintings.

Yet no matter how mysterious, Mao Ri and the Great Mulberry Tree coexisted peacefully—a sign of mutual wariness.

From the start, the tree and the bird in Zhou Qing's home had been anything but ordinary.

He brought Hu down the mountain to Jiangzhou's Zhou Village—formerly Hu Village. Reunited with elders and villagers, Hu felt as if centuries had passed in what seemed like a day.

The outside world had changed so much.

Zhou Qing sent Hu to the Qingfu Palace for treatment by Fusong.

He hoped Hu would recover, settle down, and have children—though whether his Immortal Physique could be inherited remained to be seen. Zhou Qing knew Hu's cultivation prospects were bleak, but perhaps his descendants would show promise.

After all, Hu was from Hu Village. Maybe his clansmen could persuade him.

Did Hu's origins mean the village had once produced an Immortal Physique? Had it reawakened in Hu?

These questions required time to answer. Could Hu Village have the potential to become a cultivation clan?

Such matters spanned generations—results wouldn't be immediate.

Preparing elixirs, Zhou Qing headed for the coast to cultivate amidst the tides and push for Innate perfection.

Many of his questions likely awaited answers in Master Jingyang's cave abode.

"Powerful demons and monsters outside prey on cultivators. Becoming a demon offers better chances of survival!"

This revelation weighed heavily on Zhou Qing. Must one truly become a demon to survive?

He refused to believe it.

Even as a demon, one wouldn't escape life and death—only lose oneself, a different kind of demise.

Paths are forged by walking. Where predecessors failed, he might succeed.

Zhou Qing hoped Master Jingyang had found the right path. How had the master learned of the outside world?

Surely, others had ventured forth before.

"If I fail, I'll leave this knowledge for those who come after," Zhou Qing resolved silently.

Yet no matter the hardships ahead, he wished to tread this path himself.

Onward!
