Chapter 110: Taking on Karma, Method for Forging the Wings of Time and Space

Facing the five Integration Realm grand cultivators, Liu Huang, who had originally been arrogant and ready to strike with full force, instantly became obsequious and humble.

"Seniors, please enjoy your meal and drinks. This table is on me. I'll go pay now."

Liu Huang's expression was a little stiff. He forced a smile, wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, and retreated with trembling legs, ready to leave immediately.

But how could anyone let him just leave like that?

"You kicked the door and now you want to leave? Get back in here!" Feng Ran sneered. With a raise of his palm, a silver light flashed, instantly sucking Liu Huang in. With a thud, he was forced to his knees on the ground.

"Seniors, this junior was reckless and entered the wrong room. Please spare me this once." Liu Huang's heart jolted in surprise. He quickly lowered his head, trembling, and in the interim, secretly glanced at Yang Ji out of the corner of his eye. He saw that Yang Ji was smiling with great interest. Even with a myriad of killing intent in his heart, Liu Huang dared not even breathe loudly at this moment, only obediently kneeling before everyone.

"Haha, this old fellow was quite imposing when he was chasing the Venerable One back then. Who knew he'd be so pathetic today?" Inside his sleeve, the Buddhist Child chuckled via spiritual transmission.

Liu Huang's gaze across Yang Ji's face was very brief and quick, but the people present were all extraordinary figures; they immediately noticed his small action.

Hong Bo then smiled meaningfully, "Just now, who were you demanding blood for blood from? It couldn't be our little brother Yang, could it? Hmm?"

"No, no, senior, you've misunderstood. I truly did enter the wrong room. This young brother is exceptionally talented, dignified and refined, cheerful and bright, with an imperial demeanor and natural brilliance. He's clearly a good person; how could I possibly cause him trouble?" Liu Huang repeatedly offered a conciliatory smile.

Yang Ji was taken aback, finding the flattery somewhat disingenuous. However, he had to admire Liu Huang. Facing five Integration Realm grand cultivators in such a predicament, he seemed obsequious, but in reality, he had calmed down. His true thoughts were hidden deep in his eyes, while outwardly he deliberately showed fear. He truly lived up to his age, capable of bending and stretching, calmly adapting to circumstances. No wonder he was able to cultivate to the Void Refinement Realm.

What puzzled Yang Ji was that, judging by Liu Huang's demeanor, he seemed submissive and not a reckless person. So why would he be so arrogant as to kick the door in? Just as he was pondering, he heard Liu Huang angrily transmit a message to his subordinate outside the door: "You idiot! Didn't you tell me these six people were being polite to him because they were all pushovers? How are they all Integration Realm grand cultivators?!"

"Fort Master, these six people were indeed very polite to him. I thought they were just amicably befriending a small Nascent Soul cultivator and were all insignificant figures. How was I to know they were all Integration Realm grand cultivators?"

"Fort Master, but that's truly how it is! Look, they really are quite polite to him; they even call him 'little brother'."

"You... you idiot, you've ruined me!" Liu Huang was filled with sorrow and rage.

"For... Fort Master, your killing intent got the better of you, you acted impulsively."

*Pffft!* Liu Huang's heart surged with old blood, and his body couldn't help but tremble slightly.

Outside the door, the two black-robed figures saw that the situation was not right. They exchanged a glance and immediately prepared to quietly leave. But just as they took two steps, they heard Grand Venerable Mo Yuan say coldly, "Get in here."

He extended a single palm towards the door, and the two black-robed figures instantly transformed into two arcs of flowing light, disappearing into his palm.

"Ah! A world in his palm, myriad phenomena within! Are you a Mahayana cultivator?!" The two infinitely shrinking black-robed figures darted wildly in Grand Venerable Mo Yuan's palm, instantly turning pale with fright.

"Demon Monarchs? Two Sky Demons comparable to Void Refinement Realm cultivators." Yang Ji's gaze narrowed. He identified them in one breath, shocking them even more.

At the same time, Liu Huang, who was kneeling on the ground, also trembled subtly upon hearing this.

"How dare you collude with Sky Demons! You deserve to die!" Grand Venerable Mo Yuan roared abruptly. His five fingers silently pressed together, and the two Sky Demons in his palm immediately shrieked.

"Ah, you can't kill us! Demon Emperor Tiange won't let you get away with this!"

"Hmph, Demon Emperor? Even if a Demon God comes, I'll still kill them." What kind of person was Grand Venerable Mo Yuan? He was a Mortal Immortal. A mere Demon Emperor was only comparable to a Mahayana cultivator, and a Demon God was merely a Tribulation Immortal. Even if the Demon Lord himself came, it would be useless. The deaths of the two demons were already sealed.

His five fingers tightened, followed by two screams and two wisps of black smoke. The two Demon Monarchs were utterly annihilated, their souls scattered.

"Extraterrestrial Sky Demons are vicious and malicious, viewing all races as food. They are like rats crossing the street in the Myriad Realms, hunted by everyone. Wherever they go, nothing good comes of it," Gao Shi said gravely.

"This person actually colluded with Sky Demons! Despicable!" Feng Ran said with a murderous air.

"Senior, spare my life!" Liu Huang cried out, his body trembling. He was truly terrified.

"No matter what grudge you have with little friend Yang, because of these two Sky Demons today, I will take on the karma between you two." Grand Venerable Mo Yuan extended his palm, pulling Liu Huang into it. His divine sense surged into Liu Huang's sea of consciousness, brutally reading his memories. Liu Huang's seven orifices bled, and his soul was instantly scattered.

"So it was some dirty business." Grand Venerable Mo Yuan's expression turned cold. A fierce flame ignited in his palm, instantly burning Liu Huang's corpse to ashes.

Two Demon Monarchs and one Void Refinement cultivator instantly met gruesome deaths. Outside the door, the last person from Liu Huang Fort was terrified. He turned and tried to escape. But Grand Venerable Mo Yuan's gaze lifted. He seized him from the air, a stream of light disappearing into his palm. With a squeeze of his five fingers, the person inside was crushed into bloody foam before even emitting a scream.

In an instant, all four were dead.

"Ah, you killed them all?" Qing Ling, who had come to stop him, was startled when she saw Grand Venerable Mo Yuan displaying his might.

"The karma here should not spread. Let it be buried here forever." A layer of immortal light suddenly surged from Grand Venerable Mo Yuan's body, quickly enveloping everyone inside the Immortal Arrival Inn. Immediately after, everyone shuddered. In a trance, their memories seemed to have been cut, as if they had forgotten something. They shook their heads in confusion, yet couldn't recall what it was.

As the immortal light passed, the shattered room door reassembled and firmly settled back onto its frame, perfectly intact.

"Huh? Why am I here?" Qing Ling's delicate brows furrowed slightly, feeling a bit puzzled. She looked at Hong Bo and the others, then quickly reacted, smiling, "Seniors, do you need something from me?"

"Oh, nothing needed. You may go," Hong Bo chuckled.

"Alright, Seniors, if you need anything, please don't hesitate to call me." Qing Ling smiled sweetly and slowly withdrew.

"I have erased the memories of everyone inside the Immortal Arrival Inn from the past half incense stick's time. As for those outside the inn, there are formations isolating them, so they couldn't hear the commotion inside," Grand Venerable Mo Yuan slowly explained.

Everyone looked at Grand Venerable Mo Yuan, filled with astonishment. Such a method was truly powerful; silently erasing others' memories. Mortal Immortals were indeed extraordinary.

"After we've had our fill of wine and food, I'll go to Liu Huang Fort to cut off the source of karma, to prevent the Sky Demons from affecting the Immortal Arrival Inn. Also, I'll pay a visit to that Demon Emperor!" Grand Venerable Mo Yuan said coldly.

Everyone knew that with these words from the Grand Venerable, that Demon Emperor's death sentence had been pronounced.

"Come, don't let this person ruin the atmosphere. I've even killed Demon Lords; a mere Demon Emperor is nothing. I'll take on all the karma; it has nothing to do with you all." Grand Venerable Mo Yuan suddenly smiled, raising his cup to everyone.

"To the Grand Venerable!" Everyone exchanged glances, raising their cups with a smile.

Yang Ji also raised his cup, smiling as he drank with everyone. Afterward, he also raised his cup specifically to Grand Venerable Mo Yuan, respectfully saying, "Many thanks to Grand Venerable today."

"No matter. Colluding with Sky Demons, their deaths are nothing to regret," Grand Venerable Mo Yuan said, chatting and laughing as he drained his cup.

Yang Ji felt a surge of emotion, never expecting that the karma between him and Liu Huang would be settled in this manner.

After leaving the Immortal Arrival Inn, everyone exchanged contact methods and dispersed. Grand Venerable Mo Yuan flew in the direction of Liu Huang Fort. Yang Ji, on the other hand, flew towards the Wuji Dao Sect. His task was now complete; he had passed the second assessment. This meant he could stay within the sect for another hundred years. A hundred years later would be his third task, and if he could pass it, he would be able to permanently remain in the Dao Sect, enjoying its divine abilities, cultivation techniques, and resources.

After five days of using the teleportation array, Yang Ji returned to the sect. The mission verification passed smoothly. On the Dao Sect's talisman, the assessment elder had inscribed with his unique Dao power: "Successfully killed Young Master Hua Liu, completed the second assessment task." Seeing these words, a smile also appeared on Yang Ji's face.

With the second assessment passed, not only could he go to the Dao Pagoda to acquire a grand divine ability or a Dao-grade cultivation method, but the Canglan Sect would also benefit from this. The Dao Sect's rewards would be distributed, and he was quite happy to finally be able to make some contributions to the Canglan Sect.

The Canglan Sect possessed a Dao-grade cultivation method, the "True Adamant Divine Art," a grand offensive divine ability, the "Returning to Chaos Sword Art," and a grand movement divine ability, the "Grand Heaven Teleportation." What was currently lacking was a grand defensive divine ability and a grand flying divine ability. He possessed the body-tempering art "Humanoid Weapon," but this was inherited from a Demon Emperor, not from the Dao Sect. Yang Ji pondered for a moment and still had no intention of handing it over to the sect. Because too much was involved; the Demonic Sect was not as amicable as the Dao Sect, and he feared the Canglan Sect might not be able to bear such karma. As for handing it over to Senior Brother Li Changxiao, that was different. Senior Brother Li Changxiao was a Dao Sect disciple, with outstanding talent and abundant luck. If he were to become a true disciple in the future, he would definitely be able to bear such karma. Considering this, Yang Ji had no intention of handing over "Humanoid Weapon."

Instead, he went to the Dao Pagoda and, taking advantage of completing his second assessment task, exchanged for a speed-type divine ability, the "Soaring Light of Earth." Afterward, Yang Ji went to the Reward Hall, found the relevant elder, and handed him the first three volumes of the "Soaring Light of Earth" he had exchanged for, along with the last four forms of the "Returning to Chaos Sword Art," and the fourth and fifth volumes of the "True Adamant Divine Art." When the elder sent someone to distribute the rewards to the Canglan Sect, these could be given out together. Of course, having exchanged for the Soaring Light of Earth, he could also cultivate it himself. While flying magic treasures were good, having cultivation techniques mastered himself gave him more confidence.

Upon returning to Dao Peak, Yang Ji found that Chong Yuan and the others had not yet returned from exploring the secret realm, so he could only offer a silent prayer for them.

Inside the main hall.

Yang Ji sat cross-legged, his divine sense probing into the cluster of immortal light within his sea of consciousness. Inside this cluster of immortal light was the method for forging the "Wings of Time and Space," an invaluable and immensely significant secret. The moment he touched it, a deep, resonant voice sounded, belonging to Grand Venerable Mo Yuan.

"The Wings of Time and Space are a realm-suppressing treasure, containing hundreds of millions of unique Dao patterns. They possess endless creation and profound mystery, a supreme treasure of heaven and earth, comparable to an Immortal King artifact."

"By chance, I've grasped three thousand Dao patterns for forging the Wings of Time and Space. With these three thousand Dao patterns, combined with Space Stones and Time Stones, a top-grade Dao artifact can certainly be forged."

"Little friend possesses the Primordial Divine Tree, which can easily melt Space Stones and Time Stones using the Primordial Divine Thunder, thus forging the Wings of Time and Space."

"Furthermore, the Dao patterns contained within each realm-suppressing treasure are extremely special. They can only be inscribed onto materials capable of bearing them. Forcibly inscribing them onto other materials would result in one of two outcomes: either the patterns cannot be inscribed, or the material is destroyed by the Dao patterns."

"The original materials for the Wings of Time and Space are Space Stones and Time Stones, so the unique Dao patterns they contain can only be inscribed within Time Stones and Space Stones."

As Grand Venerable Mo Yuan's words faded, Yang Ji saw three thousand ever-changing Dao patterns within the cluster of immortal light, as well as a model of the Wings of Time and Space condensed by a grand divine ability. That pair of immortal light-shining Wings of Time and Space had three thousand wings on each side, and each wing resembled a flying sword, bearing a ninety percent resemblance to his own Sword Wings.

Yang Ji couldn't help but be stunned, wondering if Senior Fu Dongliu had created the Sword Wings based on the model of the Wings of Time and Space, but without containing the unique Dao patterns for forging them. Yang Ji summoned his Sword Wings, preparing to try inscribing the Dao patterns for forging the Wings of Time and Space into them. But after thinking about it, he gave up. He only had this one treasure; if it were destroyed, it would be equivalent to severing his wings, and his flying speed would be greatly reduced. Since Grand Venerable Mo Yuan had spoken as he did, it was likely that he had tried inscribing the Dao patterns for forging the Wings of Time and Space into other materials before, presumably without success.

However, these Time Stones and Space Stones, capable of bearing the special Dao patterns for forging the Wings of Time and Space, were top-tier materials comparable to Chaos Stones, no worse than Titanium White Fine Gold, or even better. They would be extremely difficult to acquire. But once he had enough materials, Yang Ji, possessing three thousand Dao patterns, could obtain a top-grade Dao artifact in a short time. What an immense stroke of luck this was. If he were to sell it, it's estimated that Tribulation Immortals and even some Mortal Immortals in the Myriad Realms would fight fiercely over it.

The imitation Flying Immortal Shuttle that was auctioned at the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance back then was said to have only a mere five hundred Dao patterns inscribed within it, yet it caused hundreds of Mahayana cultivators and dozens of Tribulation Immortals to contend for it. If he were to forge an imitation Wings of Time and Space containing three thousand Dao patterns, its value would likely be priceless, only tradable through bartering. Because the significance of such an artifact was too great; the effect of an imitation artifact with five hundred Dao patterns versus one with three thousand Dao patterns in weakening tribulation lightning during ascension would be vastly different. At the level of Tribulation Immortals, every tribulation required full preparation. Even a slight increase in success rate could drive them into a frenzy.

If Yang Ji could truly find Time Stones and Space Stones and forge a top-grade Dao artifact that was an imitation of the Wings of Time and Space, then, as long as he had sufficient strength, with a single call, countless Mahayana cultivators and Tribulation Immortals would likely flock to him, willing to owe him favors. It might even be possible to establish a new sect with it, creating another Dao Sect.

Of course, Yang Ji had no such ambition; he was simply more enamored with the abilities of the Wings of Time and Space. Being able to pause time, rewind time, and travel freely through the Myriad Realms as a wanderer—that was true unrestrained freedom. Against enemies, it was an even more powerful weapon; just the abilities to pause time and lock space could strike fear into anyone. In battle, victory or defeat often hinged on that single moment of pause; an instant was enough to determine life or death.

However, Space Stones and Time Stones were both rare treasures, difficult to acquire. Yang Ji pondered for a moment, concluding that his only option was to go to the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance and consult Bai Bi'er. If they didn't have them, posting a search quest would also be good.
