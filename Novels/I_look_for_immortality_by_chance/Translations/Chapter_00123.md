# Chapter 123: Three-Eyed Ape, Kui Thunder, and Dragon-Binding Wood! (Combined)

After a cultivator breaks through to the Foundation Establishment stage, the spiritual awareness in their sea of consciousness naturally transforms into divine sense.

The term "divine sense" carries the character for "divinity," making it inherently more profound than mere spiritual awareness. The most straightforward change is that divine sense possesses tangible power—it can interact with reality, manipulate objects from a distance, and even control flying swords or turn strands of hair into blades using nothing but the force of divine sense.

The primary reason Foundation Establishment cultivators require spiritual swords as vessels for their sword seals is precisely because they possess divine sense, enabling them to wield swords and merge sword techniques with spells seamlessly. In contrast, Qi Refinement cultivators can only manipulate swords through Qi, placing their methods on an entirely different—and inferior—level. Thus, they often resort to forming sword qi through seals to attack.

However, manipulating objects from a distance is merely one of divine sense's many functions. Its greatest capability lies in piercing illusions, discerning truth, and comprehending the workings of heaven and earth.

After breaking through to Foundation Establishment, Gu Yuan's Silver Flood Dragon spiritual awareness naturally evolved into Silver Flood Dragon divine sense. Within a radius of one li, every detail of the world became crystal clear to him, and nothing within this range could escape his perception.

Beyond this, divine sense plays another critical role for cultivators: combat.

Divine sense is the sixth consciousness, intricately linked to a cultivator's will. If attacked, the consequences range from mental rigidity to complete loss of consciousness. In battle, even a momentary lapse can be fatal. Given its vast range and near-instantaneous transmission—swift as a spark—divine sense often determines the outcome of a fight. Superior divine sense alone can increase one's chances of victory by twenty percent.

Thus, cultivators place immense importance on divine sense, prioritizing its enhancement after reaching Foundation Establishment. However, divine sense is profoundly mysterious, a fusion of a cultivator's will and their perception of the world. Without exceptional techniques or seals, it is nearly impossible to cultivate or strengthen.

Most cultivators resort to two alternative methods.

The first is through spiritual artifacts. These are far superior to ordinary magical instruments, exclusive to Foundation Establishment cultivators. With a mere thought, they unleash formidable power, possess innate intelligence, and can autonomously protect their master in battle. Those with weak divine sense often seek spiritual artifacts to safeguard their consciousness.

The second method involves consuming "Heaven and Earth Spiritual Waters," refining them into the sea of consciousness to bolster divine sense.

For ordinary cultivators, breaking through to Foundation Establishment transforms their spiritual awareness into divine sense, significantly enhancing their ability to perceive the world and engage in combat. However, it does not grant any extraordinary abilities.

Take Gu Yuan's Silver Flood Dragon divine sense, for example. Though it evolved from a top-tier spiritual awareness during the Qi Refinement stage, even after ascension, its combat applications remain limited to basic actions like "biting" or "tail-whipping"—lacking any profound techniques.

After all, divine sense exists primarily to help cultivators comprehend the heavens and earth and pursue the Great Dao, not for slaughter. Those seeking combat prowess must find their own means.

Fortunately, the Four Spirit Jade Pillars are precisely such treasures.

**Boom!**

With a flick of his wrist, Gu Yuan tossed the Four Spirit Jade Pillars onto the spiritual vein behind his meditation cushion.

**Whoosh!**

Instantly, spiritual energy surged like a tide into the pillars. The silver, three-eyed ape carved into the jade seemed to awaken, its eyes gleaming as mysterious power condensed along the pillar's patterns, forming droplets of liquid that dripped into the jade basin atop the pillar.

This was the essence of the Heaven and Earth exotic beast—the Three-Eyed Ape!

When refined with the Four Spirit Jade Pillars, its blood produced the "Three-Eyed Spiritual Water." Absorbing this water into the sea of consciousness granted the cultivator's divine sense a third eye, capable of piercing illusions and veils of deception—only the most formidable powers could evade its gaze.

Once refined, combined with his Heavenly Gaze technique, Gu Yuan felt he could return to his old profession with ease.

Yet, what he desired most was not the Three-Eyed Spiritual Water, but the final spiritual water the Four Spirit Jade Pillars could produce—the Kui Thunder Spiritual Water!

Kui, the essence of wind and thunder!

Consuming and refining this water imbued a cultivator's divine sense with the power of thunder. A single thought could unleash lightning, unstoppable and awe-inspiring. And Gu Yuan's Flood Dragon divine sense was uniquely suited to harness thunder's might.

Of the Four Spirit Jade Pillars' spiritual waters—excluding the Azure Crane Spiritual Water—the remaining three formed a cohesive lineage. Refining them bestowed extraordinary abilities.

**Whoosh!**

Spiritual energy surged through the cavern, pouring into the Four Spirit Jade Pillars as the spiritual waters slowly condensed. Gu Yuan watched with satisfaction.

Though the environment of Blazing Earth Island was harsh, its spiritual energy concentration was undeniable—a top-tier second-grade spiritual vein, more than sufficient to sustain the production of two spiritual waters from the pillars.

By his estimate, the Three-Eyed Spiritual Water would fully condense in about half a month. As for the Kui Thunder Spiritual Water, it would take no more than a month.

With this in mind, he turned his attention away from the pillars and settled onto his meditation cushion, retrieving the three jade slips he had acquired earlier for careful study.

"Senior Brother Gu, I've come uninvited. Would you kindly open the formation for a discussion?"

Just then, a divine sense transmission drifted into Blazing Earth Island, echoing outside its barriers.

Gu Yuan focused his mind, and in his sea of consciousness, the Silver Flood Dragon seemed to open its eyes, revealing the surrounding landscape in vivid detail.

A young woman in a crimson dress stood gracefully in the air, a golden hairpin adorning her hair, her skin as fair as snow, and a gentle smile perpetually gracing her lips. Her black tresses fluttered in the wind, exuding youthful vitality.

**Hum.**

The invisible barrier around Blazing Earth Island parted, and Bian Chuyao chuckled lightly, transforming into a crimson streak that instantly landed on the island.

The stone cavern's entrance opened wide, allowing her to step inside.

"Congratulations, Junior Sister Bian, on your breakthrough and the addition of three hundred years to your lifespan!" Gu Yuan remained seated on his cushion, smiling as he waved his sleeve, conjuring a jade table and a fresh cushion for her.

Before leaving Dry Origin Cave, Gu Yuan had packed all his belongings, anticipating he might not return. Otherwise, he wouldn't have had the means to offer tea and seating to a guest.

As for the Young Giant Divine Wood in Dry Origin Cave, it had withered and dissipated after Gu Yuan's breakthrough to Foundation Establishment, no longer able to absorb spiritual energy for him.

"I should be the one thanking you, Senior Brother. Without you, I wouldn't be where I am today!" Bian Chuyao bowed gracefully before settling onto the cushion.

But as she glanced around, her expression froze.

"Truly, 'a mountain's worth lies not in its height, but in the presence of immortals'... Senior Brother's abode may appear crude, yet it houses such a treasure!"

Initially, Bian Chuyao had felt indignant on Gu Yuan's behalf at the sight of the barren Blazing Earth Island. But upon noticing the Four Spirit Jade Pillars voraciously devouring spiritual energy, her expression turned complex.

With such a treasure, the quality of one's dwelling mattered little.

No wonder this man, born of humble origins, had managed to rival the scions of great families. So this was his secret.

Gu Yuan merely smiled faintly.

Had he still been in the Qi Refinement stage, he would never have dared to display the Four Spirit Jade Pillars so openly. But now, as a Foundation Establishment cultivator with his own spiritual island, concealment was unnecessary.

With the impending campaign in the Crimson Moon Great River, securing greater benefits required demonstrating greater capabilities. Otherwise, former allies might reconsider their stance.

After all, Foundation Establishment was a world apart from Qi Refinement, and many of his previous methods were no longer applicable...

Bian Chuyao's gaze lingered on the Four Spirit Jade Pillars, her thoughts in turmoil.

Born into privilege, she had always been proud. During the Qi Refinement stage, she had acknowledged Gu Yuan's superiority—the man's methods were simply too numerous. But Foundation Establishment changed everything. Her grandfather had personally bestowed upon her top-tier divine sense spiritual water and materials for cultivating various seals. She had been eager to prove herself against Gu Yuan once more.

Yet, the moment she stepped into his cave, he had delivered a silent rebuke.

The intricate patterns on the Four Spirit Jade Pillars unmistakably identified them as a secret treasure of the Heavenly Secrets Pavilion—a relic once used to nurture sect leaders. That such an artifact had fallen into Gu Yuan's hands...

Bian Chuyao's expression grew even more complicated. Her estimation of Gu Yuan's abilities rose yet again.

This man truly could not be measured by the standards of an ordinary disciple.

"Junior Sister, what brings you here today?" Having made his point, Gu Yuan waved his sleeve, shrouding the Four Spirit Jade Pillars in mist before addressing Bian Chuyao.

"I wouldn't have disturbed you, but I'm here on another's behalf."

"Senior Brother, while you've been cultivating in peace, the various families and factions have been in an uproar over you!"

Seeing Gu Yuan's serene demeanor, Bian Chuyao couldn't help but sigh.

The value of spiritual energy far surpassed that of ordinary spiritual items. It was the key to Foundation Establishment—three hundred years of life! No cultivator could remain indifferent.

True scions of great families, direct disciples of Golden Core masters who received genuine teachings, had no worries—their elders would spare no effort to secure spiritual energy for them. But those slightly less privileged had to fight for it themselves.

Otherwise, wouldn't everyone in the sect achieve Foundation Establishment?

Previously, with no spiritual energy circulating, tensions had been manageable. But now, with twenty strands suddenly released, the entire sect was in turmoil, with countless figures maneuvering behind the scenes.

"Even my Bian family isn't exempt. I never realized how many uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces I had until now..."

Bian Chuyao shook her head ruefully.

"And how did you distribute yours?" Gu Yuan asked.

"Blood ties and debts of gratitude are the hardest to repay. I've enjoyed the privileges of my family since childhood—wealth and resources beyond measure. It's only right to give back."

"I selected three juniors with the highest potential for Foundation Establishment and distributed the energy among them. As for the last strand... I'm keeping it in reserve."

Bian Chuyao suddenly blinked mischievously.

Everyone had their selfish desires. If the Great Dao proved unattainable, finding a Dao companion and bearing descendants was the natural course—a path beyond reproach, for without it, there would be no immortal families.

Countless peerless beauties and talented young cultivators had eventually settled into married life, raising children and living as immortal couples.

Bian Chuyao feared that one day, she might follow the same path. Thus, she would keep one strand of spiritual energy for her less-talented descendants.

If she succeeded in her Dao pursuit, she could use it as fuel for further ascension.

This wasn't due to lack of ambition—the Great Dao was simply too arduous.

After Foundation Establishment came the Golden Core stage, where countless brilliant minds had faltered. Over millennia, only a handful might succeed.

The Cloud Mist Valley, the Ancient Peak Secret Realm, and now the Four Spirit Jade Pillars had shown her that the world was vast, and talent alone did not guarantee success.

"Your distribution seems fair," Gu Yuan remarked with a smile.

"My spiritual energy is mine to allocate. Once distributed, it's a done deal, and no one can dispute it. But Senior Brother, your unassigned energy has driven everyone to distraction. You've no idea how many disciples—common-born, aristocratic, from all seven peaks—have come knocking, hoping to sway me into influencing your decision. Rumors even claim I can decide on your behalf..."

"A mere weak woman like me could never presume to speak for a genius of the sect..."

Bian Chuyao pouted slightly, casting a sidelong glance at Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan couldn't help but chuckle.

This woman was as silver-tongued as ever.

Yet, without her aid in the Ancient Peak Secret Realm, securing the spiritual energy would have been far more difficult. Moreover, he knew she was no fool—she must have her reasons for coming. Cutting to the chase, he asked, "Enough with the roundabout talk. Which esteemed figure has enlisted you as their envoy?"

Bian Chuyao smiled. "An elder from Ruyi Peak."

"As you know, the sect selects talents based on overall merit, not individual cases. The Centennial Banquet's timing is immutable—those who miss it must seek alternatives."

"Traditionally, spiritual peaks and great families have reserves to aid their disciples. But with the Southern Mountain Domain in turmoil, obtaining spiritual energy has become far more challenging. Right now, the easiest path is through you."

"A single word from you, and spiritual energy is secured, saving endless effort. Hence, they've come to you."

"Ruyi Peak has a female disciple born with a Supreme Yin Dao Body, a talent unmatched in centuries—far surpassing Si Rujing. Were it not for her youth and lower cultivation, she would have been the one to enter the Ancient Peak Secret Realm."

"She's currently at the eighth layer of Qi Refinement and will reach perfection within a few years."

"But without spiritual energy, her path to Foundation Establishment would be delayed indefinitely. Thus, Ruyi Peak approached me to negotiate for a strand of Supreme Yin Moonlight Energy."

"Normally, I'd refuse—after all, I owe my own spiritual energy to you. But Ruyi Peak's offer is too generous to pass up..."

Gu Yuan cut to the chase: "What's their offer?"

"Having forged a Ginseng Dao Foundation, you must have selected the Dragon-Binding True Seal in the Transmission Hall. This seal is immensely powerful but requires the Heaven and Earth exotic wood—Dragon-Binding Wood—to refine."

"Ruyi Peak possesses a superior-grade Dragon-Binding Wood, perfect for your seal!"
