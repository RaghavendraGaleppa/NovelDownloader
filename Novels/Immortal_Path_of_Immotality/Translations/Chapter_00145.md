# Chapter 144: The True Disciple of a Major Sect

The sounds of battle still echoed from the direction of the camp gates, while the two Golden Core cultivators who had been fighting in the sky had vanished without a trace. The atmosphere around the central command tent was heavy, almost suffocating.

"Tap."

"Tap."

"Tap."

Each of Lin Shan's steps was light, yet they landed like hammer blows on Princess Guo's heart. She could feel the young man's unwavering determination to kill her—so absolute, so final!

Her spiritual power was completely exhausted, her spirit beast puppets all destroyed, and every magical instrument had been knocked to the ground. Now, she could only lie there, utterly defenseless.

As death loomed closer, memories of her past flooded her mind like a revolving lantern: her privileged childhood in Huai'an Palace, the wealth and luxury she'd enjoyed since birth, the ice-attribute cultivation manual she'd obtained at fifteen that marked her entry into the world of cultivation. Step by step, she'd advanced to the mid Qi Refining stage, rising to prominence among the rogue cultivators of the capital.

She'd partnered with Prince Qi's faction for resources, joining three others to ambush rogue cultivators heading to Yichuan. Little did she know their first target would be Lin Shan—and their first failure.

Their second attempt was meticulously planned, even borrowing the strength of the Great Yan Princess, yet they still met defeat. The third time, she'd nearly been assassinated in her own palace.

After joining the Cangxuan Sect, she'd endured years of humiliation, weathering countless rumors and hardships. She'd painstakingly curried favor with an elder in the sect, enduring his lecherous gaze while secretly breaking through to Foundation Establishment. Venturing outside, she'd risked life and limb to seize opportunities...

And yet, here she was—still crushed beneath his foot.

Her mortal enemy now held her life in his hands, flaunting his dominance. No matter how hard she struggled, she could never surpass him. Every scheme she devised ended with him turning the tables against all odds!

The more Princess Guo thought about it, the more furious and desolate she became. She raged against the heavens for their unfairness, cursed the fickleness of fate—never once considering that she herself had started this feud, that this karma was of her own making.

---

Lin Shan's resolve was unshakable. Step by step, he approached, summoning his flying sword to deliver the final blow to Princess Guo's pale neck.

At that moment, a faint hum of a sword resonated between heaven and earth. It grew louder as it approached, its speed so great that the sound became a continuous whine, culminating in a sharp whistle as it tore through the air with explosive force.

"Clang!"

A flash of blinding light streaked past. Before anyone could react, Lin Shan's high-grade magical sword—crafted from black iron—was sent flying, tumbling twice before clattering to the ground.

Then, under the stunned gazes of onlookers...

"Crack!"

It snapped in two.

Lin Shan whirled around.

A young man in blue Daoist robes, appearing no older than twenty, rode toward them on a scrawny donkey that trod upon clouds. His face glowed with vitality, his eyes sparkled like stars, and his bearing exuded an extraordinary elegance and grace.

---

Not only did he radiate the aura of a mid Foundation Establishment cultivator, but even his seemingly frail donkey was a Foundation Establishment spirit beast. Every accessory—rings, belt, jade pendant, tassels, bracelets, boots—emitted the faint glow of high-grade magical instruments.

He approached Princess Guo, gently helping her to her feet.

The two made a striking pair—he in blue robes, she in palace attire, both Foundation Establishment cultivators, both youthful in appearance. A golden boy and a jade girl, a match made in heaven.

Lin Shan's heart pounded. This man had already reached mid Foundation Establishment yet still looked like a youth—how young was he? And with so many high-grade magical artifacts adorning him, how wealthy must he be?

A Foundation Establishment spirit beast mount was one thing, but what was that attack earlier? Lin Shan hadn't even seen it clearly, yet it had severed his high-grade flying sword in a single strike!

Luan Chun, the little girl from the Black Lotus Sect, finally snapped out of her daze, realizing the gravity of the situation. But when it mattered, she proved reliable, leaping to Lin Shan's side to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him.

As fellow members of the Black Lotus Sect, their fates were intertwined.

Meanwhile, the young man in blue carefully fed Princess Guo a few healing pills, watching as color gradually returned to her face before finally relaxing.

With unhurried grace, he cupped his hands toward Lin Shan and Luan Chun in polite greeting.

"Qi Zhong, True Disciple of the Qianyun Pavilion."

"Greetings, fellow Daoists. My respects to you both."

Despite having just witnessed Lin Shan's attempt on Princess Guo's life, his manners remained impeccable—a testament to the upbringing of a true disciple from a major sect, his poise and bearing beyond ordinary measure.

Caught off guard by his demeanor, Lin Shan and Luan Chun instinctively returned the courtesy, introducing themselves in turn.

But they quickly caught themselves.

Behind them, their fellow sect members were locked in life-and-death combat. They were demonic cultivators! Why were they playing along with this decorum? Why follow the formalities of the righteous path?

Lin Shan's heart chilled. He realized that the other party had somehow influenced their minds, subtly weakening their resolve without them noticing. Truly, a true disciple of a major sect could seize the upper hand without lifting a finger.

The name "Qianyun Pavilion" was renowned throughout the Great Song Dynasty, standing alongside the Purple Thunder Sect and the Beast Taming Valley as one of the three great orthodox sects.

The Purple Thunder Sect excelled in lightning techniques, the Beast Taming Valley in controlling beasts, and the Qianyun Pavilion in artifact forging.

No wonder this man was decked out in high-grade magical artifacts—artificers were notoriously wealthy. Not only did they make money easily, but their equipment also made them formidable in battle.

But this was the central war zone, where the Black Lotus Sect and the Purple Thunder Sect were supposed to clash. The Qianyun Pavilion should have been defending the northern stretches of the Falling Pine Mountains or engaging the Yellow Spring Sect from the Great Yan Dynasty in the distant northwest.

What was he doing here?

Lin Shan remained vigilant as he recalled something he'd heard from Nightingale—that Princess Guo had a fiancé, a true disciple of the Qianyun Pavilion.

Back when he'd returned to Yichuan Market for the second time, he'd taken a detour specifically to avoid this man.

Now, facing him in person, Lin Shan realized how far-reaching Princess Guo's schemes had been. Each time he'd resolved to kill her without hesitation (defying the trope of villains monologuing), some last-minute intervention had saved her at the critical moment.

Still, given Princess Guo's beauty, talent, and cunning, it wasn't surprising she'd won the heart of a true disciple from a major sect. Had they not been enemies, even Lin Shan might have been charmed.

But an enemy was an enemy. No matter how many allies she had, he would cut them all down with his sword—just as he'd shown no mercy to the brocade-robed man and his companions years ago.

Speaking of swords... Lin Shan suddenly remembered his broken weapon. With a wave of his hand, he summoned the two halves back to his grasp. Qi Zhong made no move to stop him, even offering an apology.

"In the urgency of saving a life, I had no choice but to use my Geng Metal Sword Qi, destroying your weapon. My deepest apologies."

Only then did Lin Shan notice the faint golden light swirling around Qi Zhong's fingertip—a tiny, delicate thing, yet radiating a chilling sharpness. This must be the so-called Geng Metal Sword Qi.

Something so small could sever a high-grade magical sword in one strike?

A cold dread settled in Lin Shan's heart. He'd never encountered anything so lethally sharp before and had no idea of its origins.

Qi Zhong studied Lin Shan and Luan Chun, then the towering Water Bear chieftain behind them, the tree-men encircling the area—four of whom also exuded Foundation Establishment auras. His gaze flickered briefly to the weakened Princess Guo before he spoke again, ever courteous.

"Brother, forgiveness is a virtue. Would you grant me this face and let the matter rest?"

The words struck Lin Shan as eerily familiar—the same phrase the Nascent Soul elder Jinglian had used when stopping him from cursing Xiong Shan. Back then, refusal hadn't been an option.

Now, hearing similar words from Qi Zhong, whose demeanor so mirrored Jinglian's, Lin Shan couldn't help but sneer.

That old Nascent Soul monster was beyond him for now, but he'd settle that score eventually. And who did this guy think he was? Did he think his Geng Metal Sword Qi made him invincible?

"This grudge isn't yours to mediate. If you know what's good for you, stay out of it."

Qi Zhong seemed unaware of the history between them, continuing earnestly:

"I take no part in the strife between righteousness and demonic paths. I came only to retrieve Junior Sister Guo. Must you persist so relentlessly?"

"Our feud runs deeper than you know. She started it all."

"Whatever grievances exist, I'll bear them in her stead. As her betrothed, it's my duty."

"Listen, brother—her waters run too deep. You're out of your depth."

"Hmm? How would you know how deep her waters run?"

---

Their conversation quickly devolved into misalignment. As they argued, Lin Shan realized Qi Zhong seemed genuinely unaware of his history with Princess Guo.

The young disciple simply assumed Lin Shan was a demonic cultivator attacking the camp, with Princess Guo defending it. He had no intention of fighting Lin Shan—he just wanted to take Princess Guo and leave.

Had Princess Guo never told him?

Lin Shan shot a puzzled glance at Princess Guo, who averted her eyes in panic. Understanding dawned.

Princess Guo had clearly kept her past misdeeds hidden to preserve her innocent image in Qi Zhong's eyes. Ambushing and killing travelers might be normal for rogue cultivators, but a righteous disciple like Qi Zhong would surely despise such acts.

So the Qianyun Pavilion's true disciple had been kept in the dark.

Lin Shan's eyes gleamed. He stepped forward.

This deceitful, venomous woman—today, he'd expose her true nature. Losing a wealthy, influential fiancé like Qi Zhong would devastate her.

"Brother, you've been deceived! This woman is a viper. It started in the Yan Cloud Mountains—"

"Shut up!" Princess Guo cried out, desperate to silence him. But Lin Shan's mouth was his own, and no one could stop him.

He recounted everything—from the Yan Cloud Mountains to the Great Song capital. Beside him, Luan Chun—genuinely naive—grew increasingly furious, her cheeks flushing red as she pointed at Princess Guo. "So you're this kind of scheming, poisonous woman!"

"Finished?" Qi Zhong's expression was unreadable.

The Qianyun Pavilion's true disciple had shed his earlier refinement. The courtesy he'd shown moments ago might as well have been an illusion.

"The cultivation world is built on deception. Even the righteous path wears a mask of hypocrisy. Killing for treasure is commonplace—did you think orthodox disciples like me are so naive?"

Lin Shan was stunned. He'd underestimated Qi Zhong. The man's earlier demeanor had painted him as an upright gentleman, but he saw everything with crystal clarity.

Princess Guo looked equally shocked, as if seeing him for the first time.

"I know exactly what kind of person Junior Sister Guo is. How she conducts herself is none of your concern!"

Qi Zhong had transformed from a refined scholar into an overbearing protector, his words dripping with domineering confidence. As her fiancé, no matter how much wrong she'd done, he wouldn't allow others to judge her—such was the arrogance born of his strength and backing.

Luan Chun, ever the fickle demoness, clasped her hands in admiration. "So domineering! I love it!"

"Shing—!"

Lin Shan drew his sword, leveling it at Qi Zhong.

The water-blue artifact thrummed with ancient Daoist rhythms, its edge sharp enough to reflect his unyielding killing intent. He'd see whether this "Geng Metal Sword Qi" could snap his treasured Severing Water Sword in two.

"So, Qi Zhong—if you insist on interfering..."

"Then stay with her—forever!"
