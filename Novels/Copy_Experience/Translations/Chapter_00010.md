**Chapter 10: News of the Azurewood Art**

Hunting demonic beasts was a very profitable endeavor, as these creatures were essentially treasures from head to toe for human cultivators. Their blood, fur, bones, scales, horns, and feathers could be used for artifact refining, pill concoction, or talisman crafting. Their meat could be used to feed spirit beasts, and some demonic beast meat was even edible.

“Want to buy some demonic beast meat? I can give you a discount!” Yin Yu’s voice chimed in at just the right moment.

Lu Xu’s heart stirred. Now that he was wealthy, it was indeed time to improve his living standards.

“How much for the demonic beast meat?”

“I sell it to others at five catties of meat for one spirit stone. For you, it’ll be six catties for one spirit stone!”

“That expensive?”

“Not at all! This meat came from a first-order mid-grade Fire-Horned Demonic Ox that I hunted. Its flesh and blood are rich in vital essence, which can strengthen tendons and bones, greatly benefiting a cultivator’s physical body!”

“A Fire-Horned Demonic Ox? Fairy Yin truly has impressive methods; you must have made a fortune!”

Fire-Horned Demonic Oxen were not easy to deal with. They were thick-skinned and muscular, incredibly strong, swift as the wind, and even skilled in some fire-element divine abilities. Although they were only first-order mid-grade demonic beasts, even ordinary late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators found it difficult to defeat them. However, successfully hunting one yielded astonishingly rich rewards; the more powerful the Fire-Horned Demonic Ox, the higher the value of its horn, fur, and other parts.

“Fortune? How is this a fortune? To deal with that ox, I destroyed a magical artifact, used up over twenty talismans, and fought it in the Myriad Demon Mountain Range for a full seven days. I almost died there myself!” Yin Yu rolled her eyes as she spoke. Given her Qi Condensation Layer 7 cultivation, this indeed showed how difficult the Fire-Horned Demonic Ox was to handle.

“Oh, right, my talisman reserves are low. I was planning to buy some from you at a low price. You won’t refuse, will you?” Yin Yu asked, changing the subject.

“Of course not! We had an agreement!”

“Alright, then give me forty talismans!” Yin Yu said with a gentle smile.

Lu Xu took out forty talismans from his storage pouch. Yin Yu glanced at them and saw that there was a variety: Qi Concealment Talismans, Fireball Talismans, Earth Spike Talismans, Ice Talismans… She nodded in satisfaction. With this batch of talismans, she wouldn’t need to purchase any more for a long time.

“According to our previous agreement, these forty talismans sell for thirty-seven spirit stones. And please weigh out seven spirit stones worth of demonic beast meat for me!”

“Alright, Fellow Daoist Lu is indeed a man of his word!”

Yin Yu smiled. Her initial investment had now borne fruit, directly saving her three spirit stones this time. After weighing out forty-two catties of demonic beast meat and handing thirty spirit stones to Lu Xu, the two completed their transaction.

Lu Xu carried the Fire-Horned Demonic Ox meat, mentally calculating his current assets. He still had over a hundred catties of spirit rice, enough for a year. The forty-two catties of demonic beast meat would also last a year; demonic beast meat wouldn’t spoil just by being stored. As for talismans, he had forty of various types left, which he intended to keep for self-defense and not sell.

Besides these, there were his spirit stones. Adding Yin Yu’s thirty, he now had over six hundred ninety spirit stones, nearly seven hundred in total! This was a substantial amount!

Lu Xu felt a sense of urgency. He didn’t plan to continue making talismans for now. Instead, he wanted to quickly improve his cultivation. However, before that, he needed to inquire about Tan Hu’s information and get to the bottom of his origins. Additionally, Lu Xu also wanted to ask Yin Yu about things that could help him improve his cultivation.

Inside a private room in Mingqing Pavilion, Lu Xu and Yin Yu sat facing each other. A moment later, an attendant from the pavilion brought two cups of spirit tea and placed them on the table between them before quietly withdrawing.

Yin Yu picked up her teacup, took a light sip, and closed her eyes slightly. After a moment, she sighed, “This Cloud Peak Mist Tip truly lives up to its reputation. It’s so refreshing and invigorating!”

Lu Xu also picked up his teacup and took a sip. The hot tea, upon entering his mouth, transformed into a vibrant current of spiritual energy that surged through his body, circulating within his meridians. Lu Xu immediately felt as if his entire body had been cleansed. He couldn't help but praise it; this spirit tea was indeed extraordinary. No wonder a single cup could sell for one spirit stone.

Casually casting a sound isolation spell, Yin Yu looked at Lu Xu and asked, “What news do you want to inquire about from me?”

Lu Xu didn't beat around the bush and went straight to the point: “Has Fairy Yin heard of Fellow Daoist Tan Hu, the one I traded with today?”

Yin Yu gave him a meaningful look upon hearing this, then smiled softly. She had long felt that there was something mysterious about the two of them. However, she never meddled in matters unrelated to her, so she hadn't asked Lu Xu anything. After taking another sip of tea, Yin Yu slowly said,

“That Tan Hu is a strange person. His movements are always mysterious. Although he claims to be an adventuring cultivator like me, I’ve never seen him go to the Myriad Demon Mountain Range. I haven’t even seen him appear near Qinghu!” Adventuring cultivators in Qinghu Market typically hunted demons in Qinghu if their cultivation was low, or directly ventured into the Myriad Demon Mountain Range if their cultivation was high. Not going to either place certainly meant he couldn't be called an adventuring cultivator.

“He came to the market four years ago, and after he arrived, I never saw him do any work in the market, nor did I see him hunt demons or go on adventures. Yet, he never lacked spirit stones. This person is very suspicious!”

“Hmm, so he’s likely a member of a bandit cultivator organization?” Lu Xu slowly asked.

“Being a bandit cultivator is possible, but an organization? That’s unlikely! There are quite a few bandit cultivators around Qinghu Market, but most operate in groups of three to five,” Yin Yu shook her head.

Lu Xu frowned slightly. Given Tan Hu’s financial resources and the quantity of talismans he purchased, a small group of three to five bandit cultivators definitely couldn't explain it.

“Are there any major illicit forces around Qinghu Market?” Lu Xu continued to ask.

“Absolutely not. If there were, the Mo family would have eradicated them long ago!”

“However, speaking of bandit cultivator organizations, something suddenly came to mind!” Yin Yu said, a hint of uncertainty on her face. “Two years ago, it was rumored that someone saw members of the Black Robe Society, one of the Wei Kingdom’s two most notorious bandit cultivator organizations, appearing in Qinghu!”

“The Black Robe Society?”

“Yes, but this is just hearsay and not reliable!” Yin Yu said.

Lu Xu secretly noted the name and asked again, “Does Fairy Yin know anything about the Black Robe Society?”

“No one knows what the Black Robe Society is like internally. They became famous for plundering the Thousand Absolute Sect’s market. The fact that they survived the Thousand Absolute Sect’s encirclement shows their extraordinary strength!”

*Hmm, if that’s the case, then this Black Robe Society must have Foundation Establishment experts!* Lu Xu thought to himself.

Seeing that he couldn't get any more information about Tan Hu from Yin Yu, he changed the subject: “Does Fairy Yin know anyone in this market who cultivates the *Azurewood Art*?”

After leaving Mingqing Pavilion, Lu Xu immediately strolled to a corner of the market’s trading area. From a distance, he saw an old man with white hair and a white beard, dressed in green robes. His stall displayed numerous wine jars. This Fellow Daoist Liu, recommended by Yin Yu, also cultivated the *Azurewood Art*, just like Lu Xu. He seemed to be a spirit wine master, skilled in brewing spirit wine.

“Inspect Cultivation Art Experience!” Lu Xu silently willed. A green light flashed before his eyes, and a line of characters appeared:
