# Chapter 72: Eating Soft Rice with Hard Attitude

Lin Shan sat in a daze for a long time, completely stunned.

What had just happened was too bizarre to comprehend—the disappearance of the green-robed elder's soul, the opening of a path to the infinite void, the purple immortal scripture, even the storm of information that had seared into his very soul.

If not for the divine ability seed quietly suspended in his consciousness, reminding him that everything had truly occurred, he would have thought it all a dream!

Now that he possessed the divine ability seed, Lin Shan fully understood its origins. Through the "straw effigy" before him—an artifact from the Wudao Sect's legacy—he could communicate with the immortal artifact "Seven Arrows Book of Nails" and make offerings to it.

The straw effigy itself was ordinary, possessing no special properties. It merely served as a conduit chosen by the immortal artifact and thus couldn't be destroyed.

The rules and principles behind this were beyond Lin Shan's comprehension, and he had no way to investigate them further.

As the initiator of the offering, if the cultivation level of his chosen target didn't exceed his by a major realm, the power bestowed by the "Seven Arrows Book of Nails" would severely injure them.

However, if the target's cultivation was higher than his—for instance, if he, a Qi Refining cultivator, cursed a Foundation Establishment cultivator—the backlash would reverse the offering onto himself. He would then lose lifespan as compensation to the immortal artifact.

In other words, as long as he didn't recklessly curse those stronger than him, within the same major realm—regardless of early, middle, or late stages—he wouldn't need to expend his lifespan.

There were only two minor limitations to this ability: first, he needed an object bearing the target's aura, or their blood or hair to lock onto them; second, there was a cooldown period—it could only be used three times a day.

"Three times is plenty! From now on, anyone who pisses me off is getting cursed to death!"

Lin Shan slapped his thighs and leapt to his feet, brimming with excitement, already contemplating who to test this ability on first.

But after much deliberation, he suddenly realized that he had been thorough in eliminating his enemies along the way, leaving no lingering foes.

There had been one enemy—Princess Guo—but coincidentally, she had reconciled with him just that day and even promised to send him antiques. Though he remained somewhat wary and didn't fully trust her, he also didn't possess any of her personal belongings, blood, or hair.

After pondering in circles, Lin Shan gloomily gathered the array of ritual items from the ground.

"I still need to find a way to boost my immediate combat strength. If I run into a fight while traveling, who's going to give me time to curse them? Besides, to curse someone from afar, I'll need higher cultivation to sustain it."

Having reached this conclusion, Lin Shan didn't hesitate. He sat in meditation, waiting for dawn.

...

On the third day in Yichuan, Lin Shan opened his eyes, rose, and bid farewell to the inn.

He needed to reach the peak of the sixth layer of Qi Refining as soon as possible. His storage pouch still held exactly thirty spirit stones.

Arriving at the administrative hall in the city center—an ancient-style grand hall bustling with cultivators—it was clear that Yichuan's market was a busy place.

Heading to the second floor, he found the market administrator in charge of cave residence rentals—a white-bearded elder at the late Qi Refining stage.

"I am Elder Yan, the overseer of cave residence rentals in Yichuan Market."

Lin Shan quickly bowed. "Elder Yan, here is my token. I wish to rent for three months."

Elder Yan nodded, accepted the token, and gestured for Lin Shan to follow.

He led him to another hall, where a massive sand table occupied the center. It depicted the entire geography of Yichuan, including the mist formation surrounding the city and all areas within and beyond its walls.

Some spots in the mountains flickered with white light, while others glowed steadily yellow—the same applied to locations within the city.

"White dots represent available residences, yellow ones are already occupied. Feel free to choose any you like, though prices vary by location. I trust I needn't elaborate further," Elder Yan explained briefly.

Lin Shan nodded and began scanning the options.

Just then, footsteps approached, and a familiar voice from the previous day sounded behind him:

"Fellow Daoist Lin, you're also choosing a residence? What a coincidence!"

Turning, Lin Shan saw Princess Guo approaching gracefully in palace attire, smiling brightly as she stood beside him.

"Yes, quite the coincidence," Lin Shan replied with a nod before turning back to the sand table.

Princess Guo, who had been monitoring Lin Shan's every move for the past two days, knew this was no chance encounter. The moment she saw him enter the administrative hall, she'd guessed his intent to rent a residence for secluded cultivation.

She'd hurried over to learn where and for how long Lin Shan planned to cultivate, allowing her to make arrangements. Her greatest fear was that Lin Shan, with ample funds, might settle in Yichuan for years—how long would they have to wait then?

To covertly keep tabs on him, Princess Guo asked with a smile:

"Does Fellow Daoist Lin have a residence in mind? Why not be neighbors with this younger sister? We could exchange cultivation insights regularly."

She'd even dropped her royal title, referring to herself humbly as "younger sister," revealing the depth of her scheme.

But Lin Shan, wholly absorbed in his drive to grow stronger, paid no attention to such nuances. He responded absently without even glancing her way: "Sure, as you wish, Your Highness."

Princess Guo cursed inwardly at his obliviousness—no wonder he was single—but maintained her pleasant facade:

"Where does Fellow Daoist Lin plan to stay? I'll cover the rent for you. After all, we've turned hostility into friendship."

This offer gave Lin Shan pause. He was indeed short on funds. If Princess Guo was willing to foot the bill, who was he to refuse?

"In that case, I gratefully accept."

Nearby, Elder Yan pricked up his ears, his mind buzzing with gossip. Was this a wealthy woman pursuing a poor young man? Paying his rent? What luck—and yet the boy seemed utterly unappreciative, eating the proverbial soft rice with a hard attitude? 

The youth these days were truly something else!

Meanwhile, Princess Guo consoled herself: one had to spend money to make money. She'd already parted with ten spirit stones yesterday—what were a few more for rent?

By her estimate, Lin Shan would reach the peak of the sixth layer of Qi Refining within half a year, forcing him to emerge in search of opportunities. 

An ordinary cultivator renting a suburban residence paid two spirit stones per month—less than ten over several months. When the time came, he'd repay her with interest!

She stood quietly beside Lin Shan, waiting as he deliberated.

After a while:

"Elder Yan, this one. Three months."

Lin Shan pointed to a secluded, high-end courtyard in the eastern residential district. He liked its tranquil environment, with few cultivators passing by—perfect for focused cultivation.

Elder Yan nodded, inserting Lin Shan's token into the sand table. The white dot turned yellow, marking the residence as taken. He then looked between Lin Shan and Princess Guo: "Thirty spirit stones for the rent. Which of you will pay?"

Lin Shan turned to Princess Guo with hopeful eyes.
