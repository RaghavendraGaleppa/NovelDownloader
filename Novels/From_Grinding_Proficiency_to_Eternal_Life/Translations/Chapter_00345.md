Chapter 345: All Dead

"You only have this much ability?"

Xu Yunfan turned around coldly. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Whip suddenly changed its move, transforming from rigid to soft, like a spirit snake coiling towards Chu Sheng's wrist.

Chu Sheng hurriedly retracted his fist, only to see the whip tip suddenly accelerate and heavily strike his ribs!

"Pfft!"

Chu Sheng spurted blood and flew backward, three of his ribs broken.

He barely stabilized his figure, only to see Xu Yunfan had already leaped into the air, whip raised high. Ten Extreme True Qi condensed at the whip tip, forming a sharp energy that made his skin ache.

It was the killing move of the Ten Extreme Martial Way, "Return to the Void"!

How could Fairy Yunlan allow him to strike again?

If Chu Sheng died, with Xu Yunfan's terrifying strength, she would likely not fare well either. At this moment, she couldn't help but feel a trace of regret. If she had known it would be like this, she shouldn't have stepped out.

In the end, her state of mind was not stable enough; the Xuanhuang Qi on Xu Yunfan had blinded her mind.

In the next instant, the various distracting thoughts in her heart were quickly cut away, leaving only Xu Yunfan's figure in her eyes.

"Star Net Soul Lock!"

She lightly tapped the Heart-Seeking Bell with her fingertips. The bell sound turned into invisible chains binding Xu Yunfan's limbs, while her sword edge struck out again, aiming straight for Xu Yunfan's eyes.

Although the eighth-grade divine weapon had strong defense, the head was ultimately made of flesh and blood.

Xu Yunfan curled a cold sneer at the corner of his mouth. Facing Fairy Yunlan's fatal sword strike aimed straight at his brow, he didn't dodge or avoid; instead, he suddenly raised his hand towards the sword edge!

"Sss!"

The instant the sword tip pierced his palm, the gauntlet of the Dragon Scale Armor splashed with dazzling sparks. The Ten Extreme True Qi boiled within the flesh and blood, forcibly stopping the sword momentum three inches inside his palm.

Fairy Yunlan's pupils contracted sharply. Her move "Starfall Piercing Rainbow" should have pierced through gold and stone, but now it felt like stabbing into ten thousand feet of profound iron, unable to advance further!

Before she could change her move, Xu Yunfan's five fingers suddenly clenched. The muscles in his palm emitted a "zheng" explosive sound like metal clashing, actually gripping the sword edge firmly.

As the sword body trembled, Fairy Yunlan only felt a sharp pain in her wrist.

Xu Yunfan's left hand had already clasped her jade wrist holding the sword like an iron hoop. The Ten Extreme True Qi rushed up along the sword body, shredding her sleeve to pieces!

"Is it because your Penglai Pavilion's swords have been overseas for too long..." Xu Yunfan's voice carried a piercing chill, "That they aren't even qualified to scratch an itch for me."

He spoke indifferently, but his mind was calculating. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Whip in his right hand was already smashing down towards Chu Sheng's head!

Chu Sheng roared, raising both fists to the sky, trying to硬接 this whip.

However, the immense killing force transformed by the Ten Extreme True Qi of the Ten Extreme Martial Way, upon touching the fist edge, made his proud Scorching Sun True Gang instantly melt like snow meeting boiling water!

"Boom!"

The whip edge smashed down. Chu Sheng's fists burst into a mess of flesh and blood, his forearm bones shattered inch by inch.

The remaining force didn't dissipate. The whip body pressed him to his knees, his knees smashing spiderweb-like cracks into the training platform.

"The 'Scorching Sun Venerable' of the Nine Luminaries Sect?" Xu Yunfan looked down at Chu Sheng, whose face was covered in blood and dirt, his voice cold as a freezing abyss. "After today, the Nine Luminaries Sect should change its Venerable title."

Before his words fell, the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Whip rose again.

"Stop!"

Fairy Yunlan shouted sharply. The sword edge vibrated violently. Xu Yunfan felt its sharpness and had to open his fingers. Fairy Yunlan finally broke free from Xu Yunfan's left hand and stabbed towards the death acupoint on his back!

But Xu Yunfan seemed to have eyes behind his back. His figure tilted slightly, using his shoulder armor to硬接 this sword, while the whip edge fell without hesitation towards Chu Sheng's Tianling Cover!

"Bang!"

Red and white matter splattered everywhere. Chu Sheng's headless corpse swayed and fell heavily to the ground.

Fairy Yunlan retreated ten zhang, holding her sword with a slightly trembling hand.

She finally realized that the man before her was not an existence that a ninth-grade Qi Condensation Supreme Grandmaster could contend with.

Dragon Scale Armor, a tempered body, terrifying strength, Ten Extreme True Qi—under the叠加 of these factors, Xu Yunfan was nearly invincible in this realm!

The opponent seemed to have truly reached the ultimate limit of the ninth-grade Qi Condensation.

Xu Yunfan wiped away the remaining bloodstains on his palm indifferently. The Ten Extreme True Qi surged like a river. The wound pierced through by the sword edge in his palm actually writhed with flesh and blood in an instant.

As the true qi transformed into vitality flowing, the muscle tissue healed at a visible speed, leaving not even a scar.

What was even more startling was that the hole pierced in the Dragon Scale Armor leaf shone with a golden-red luster. The patterns on the armor surface lit up one by one. The broken scales grew and spliced together like living things, restoring to their original state in the blink of an eye, even faintly revealing a sharper edge than before.

The buzzing sound emitted by the resonance between true qi and the armor made the gravel within a radius of ten zhang tremble along with it.

His gaze swept over the chaotic scene.

Daoist Guanshan had no vitality left, Chu Sheng's head was crushed, and Fairy Yunlan's sword was broken and her armor cracked.

He slowly raised the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Whip. The blood dripping from the whip tip scorched white smoke on the blue bricks. He looked at the field, where only Fairy Yunlan remained.

Seeing Xu Yunfan look over, Fairy Yunlan's body tightened slightly and she couldn't help but speak.

"We can talk. My Penglai Pavilion possesses true immortal methods. If you can share the Xuanhuang Qi, my Penglai Pavilion can find a way for you to set foot on the immortal path."

Seeing that Xu Yunfan seemed not to hear, just walking over slowly holding the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Whip, Fairy Yunlan couldn't help but continue: "This world is a cage, the ninth grade is the limit. If you take that step, great disaster will surely befall you."

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Whip suddenly burst with a dazzling blood light. Xu Yunfan's wrist shook. The whip body tore through the air like a red dragon leaving the abyss, aiming straight for Fairy Yunlan's heart, carrying the violent vortex of the Ten Extreme True Qi!

Fairy Yunlan's pupils contracted sharply. Having prepared early, she formed the Star Net Heart-Seeking Formula, and the sword edge bloomed with seven layers of protective starlight.

However, this protective sword gang shattered one after another the instant the whip edge touched it. The Ten Extreme True Qi entangled around the whip tip was like bone-rotting poison, eroding her famous Penglai protective sword qi until it was full of holes.

"Pfft!"

The whip edge pierced through her chest, pinning Fairy Yunlan firmly into the obsidian base of the Xuanwu Training Platform.

She vomited a large mouthful of blood. The Star Net Heart-Seeking Bell cracked in half amidst violent trembling. Before the bell sound had even dissipated, Xu Yunfan had already stepped one foot onto the end of the whip handle.

The Ten Extreme True Qi blasted into her four limbs and hundred bones along the whip body. The ice muscle jade bone body cultivated by the Penglai Pavilion's secret martial arts emitted cracking sounds unable to bear the burden, and the acupoints around her body exploded with blood flowers one after another.

"You won't understand. You will be like me, forever falling into the Avici Hell. In this world, no one can transcend..."

Fairy Yunlan's blood-stained fingertips scratched the whip body futilely. Her pupils reflected Xu Yunfan's cold face.

Xu Yunfan turned the whip handle indifferently. The nine dragon patterns on the whip body lit up one by one, completely grinding Fairy Yunlan's remaining vitality to nothing.

The setting sun was like blood, illuminating the fragmented Xuanwu Training Platform in the center of the Imperial Capital.

Imperial Astronomer Bureau Chief Guo Lang sat slumped under a half-broken wall in the distance. His official robe was covered in dust and bloodstains, and the cracked compass in his hand had long stopped spinning.

He stared fixedly at the three corpses not far away: Daoist Guanshan of the Xuanzhen Sect with a crushed head, Chu Sheng of the Nine Luminaries Sect with a collapsed chest, and Fairy Yunlan of the Penglai Pavilion with a pierced heart.

Three Supreme Grandmasters of the ninth-grade Qi Condensation, who had shaken the six paths of the Great Zhou Dynasty, were now lying dead on the spot like ants!
