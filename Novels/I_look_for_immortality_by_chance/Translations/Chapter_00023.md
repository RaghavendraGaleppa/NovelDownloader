# Chapter 23: Crushing with Authority, the White Worm Ice Prison  

According to the sect's regulations, any disciple wishing to engage in a life-or-death duel must first obtain a golden decree from the Enforcement Hall. Both parties must then seal it with their blood before the duel can commence.  

The victor would then use the golden decree to enter the Enforcement Hall, activate the formation, and seize everything from the defeated party's cave abode.  

This was the proper "duel procedure" as stipulated by the sect.  

Everything Gu Yuan said was in accordance with the rules.  

There wasn't a single flaw to be found.  

And all of this had been part of his calculations.  

He understood clearly that he had no connection to the Golden Core Elder. Once the truth of his admission into the sect became known, it would inevitably invite complications.  

Moreover, due to the dispute over the cave abode, he had already offended the Lan Family and possibly even provoked Qiu Mingshan.  

Thus, he needed to find a new "backer."  

That backer was none other than the sect's laws and regulations!  

The Qingfeng Daoist Sect was a major sect, and the difference between major and minor sects lay in governance—minor sects were ruled by individuals, while major sects were governed by laws.  

The Qingfeng Daoist Sect had tens of thousands of disciples, a vast expanse of marshlands spanning thousands of miles, countless islands, and innumerable mortals under its jurisdiction. Such a vast territory naturally required a "legal framework" to maintain order; otherwise, managing such a large sect would be impossible.  

With laws came rules, and with rules came opportunities to exploit—opportunities to ensure one's own growth.  

In a minor sect, Foundation Establishment cultivators were elders or even sect leaders, their every word carrying the weight of law. Ordinary Qi Refinement disciples had no means to oppose them.  

But the Qingfeng Daoist Sect was different. Foundation Establishment disciples were not uncommon, so even they were bound by the sect's laws and could not act recklessly.  

This was precisely why the sect had established these regulations.  

With so many Foundation Establishment cultivators and powerful families within the sect, the absence of strict laws would allow the elite families to freely oppress common disciples. Over time, the sect would become a stagnant, foul pool.  

Though the laws couldn't erase the resource gap between noble families and common disciples, they at least ensured the latter could cultivate in peace.  

This alone was already a rare advantage.  

When Huolongzi had envied Gu Yuan for joining the Qingfeng Daoist Sect, "stability" had been a key factor.  

In this world, finding a place where one could cultivate in peace was no small feat.  

The silver-tinged golden light in the Demon Star Grotto hadn't appeared without reason.  

Gu Yuan was well aware of this, which was why he remained unshaken.  

Though the Lan Family was powerful, they couldn't crush him outright.  

Once he grew stronger, he could revisit this matter.  

Today, when Lan Tianlu suddenly appeared, Gu Yuan not only remained calm but was even intrigued by his solitary arrival. He deliberately provoked him with the "Three Laws."  

As expected, Lan Tianlu couldn't restrain himself and immediately resorted to violence, choosing the life-or-death duel method.  

This confirmed Gu Yuan's suspicions.  

"The Lan Family might not know about the Four Spirit Jade Pillars... or perhaps they simply can't support Lan Tianlu!"  

"So Lan Tianlu had no choice but to challenge me to a duel, hoping to kill me while I'm still weak and seize the Spirit Flood Dragon Heavenly Water!"  

With this realization, Gu Yuan felt even more at ease. He decided to play along, using the opportunity to observe the combat techniques of elite disciples and prepare for future battles.  

As expected, the seals he had learned from his previous life couldn't compare to the heritage of major sects and noble families.  

Left with no choice, Gu Yuan activated the formation and suppressed Lan Tianlu outright.  

---  

"Elder, this man has no golden decree, nor have we sealed it with blood. How can this be considered a proper duel?"  

"I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the sect by Elder Hu's favor. I've only just begun converting my cultivation techniques and haven't even learned a single high-grade seal. Must I endure such oppression?"  

Gu Yuan's voice was laced with indignation and anger, making him appear deeply wronged.  

"Despicable! Despicable!"  

"You were the one who challenged me to a duel, and now you're going back on your word!"  

"Release me! I swear I'll kill you!"  

Nearby, Lan Tianlu was so enraged by Gu Yuan's "pitiful" tone that he nearly exploded. He now realized he had fallen into Gu Yuan's trap.  

The other party had deliberately provoked him into attacking so he could use the formation to suppress him.  

This lowly disciple from a minor sect was truly shameless!  

But even though he understood, there was nothing he could do. He couldn't afford to wait.  

If Gu Yuan took the "Spirit Flood Dragon Heavenly Water" first, he would lose the advantage. That was why he had acted so hastily when Gu Yuan mentioned the duel—only to realize Gu Yuan had outmaneuvered him from the start.  

With the cave formation as his safeguard, even if Lan Tianming himself had come, he wouldn't have been able to kill Gu Yuan within the sect.  

"Elder Hu? Which Elder Hu? Could it be Elder Hu from Jade Pot Peak?"  

The Enforcement Hall elder, sharp-eared, immediately caught the key detail in Gu Yuan's words.  

"Indeed, Elder Hu of Jade Pot Peak!"  

Gu Yuan clasped his hands respectfully.  

During his time in the Scripture Pavilion, he had familiarized himself with the major families and factions within the Qingfeng Daoist Sect. He also learned that the Golden Core Elder who had brought him into the sect was none other than the master of Jade Pot Peak—Sword Fox.  

"So you're the lucky one who solved the mystery behind Elder Hu's female disciple's death?"  

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the elder was well-informed and quickly pieced things together.  

"I was merely fortunate," Gu Yuan replied modestly, no longer hiding the truth.  

The elder fell into deep thought.  

---  

He himself had come from humble origins and harbored a natural disdain for the sect's elite disciples. Since Gu Yuan had acted strictly in accordance with the rules and was personally recommended by a Golden Core Elder, the elder knew exactly how to handle the situation.  

"Disciple Lan Tianlu of Hidden Flood Dragon Court, for attacking a fellow disciple without cause, you are fined twenty spirit stones and sentenced to fifteen days in the White Worm Ice Prison for reflection!"  

"Remember, private duels are forbidden in the sect. If you have grievances, bring them to the Enforcement Hall and obtain a golden decree!"  

With a sweep of his sleeve, the elder delivered his verdict.  

The glowing formation runes outside Gu Yuan's cave dimmed and faded, releasing the pressure that had pinned Lan Tianlu down.  

But before he could react, emerald vines lashed out, binding him completely.  

"Rele—"  

His furious roar was stifled in his throat, leaving him unable to utter a sound. He could only glare at Gu Yuan with murderous intent.  

"What? Do you object to the Enforcement Hall's judgment?"  

"Hand over the spirit stones immediately, then follow me to the White Worm Ice Prison!"  

The elder's cold gaze bore down on Lan Tianlu.  

Taking several deep breaths to suppress his rage, Lan Tianlu opened his storage pouch and allowed the elder to confiscate twenty spirit stones.  

"Half of the Enforcement Hall's fines go to the victim. Here are ten spirit stones for you."  

The elder took the stones and, with a flick of his wrist, sent ten of them floating into Gu Yuan's palm.  

Hearing the word "victim," Lan Tianlu's eyes burned crimson, as if he wanted to tear someone apart.  

But the elder merely waved his sleeve and vanished from Gu Yuan's cave with Lan Tianlu in tow.  

Watching their retreating figures and the ten spirit stones in his hand, Gu Yuan couldn't help but chuckle softly.  

Lan Tianlu lacked depth and wasn't particularly strong. The Lan Family didn't seem to have invested much in him either.  

He wasn't a deadly adversary.  

Gu Yuan didn't take him seriously.  

The outcome of their conflict had been decided the moment Gu Yuan, backed by a Golden Core Elder's influence, had seized the cave abode from the Lan Family.  

But Lan Tianlu's harassment was just a glimpse of what lay ahead on the path of cultivation.  

Wealth, companions, techniques, and territory—all were contested!  

To climb higher and go further in his cultivation, Gu Yuan would face countless such struggles in the future.  

He couldn't rely on authority to crush his opponents every time, nor were the sect's laws an invincible shield.  

He needed to grow stronger—fast.  

"Fortunately, an excellent opportunity lies right before me."  

Rubbing the spirit stones in his hand, Gu Yuan smiled faintly before stepping back into his cave and sealing the stone door behind him.  

It was time to cultivate in seclusion.
