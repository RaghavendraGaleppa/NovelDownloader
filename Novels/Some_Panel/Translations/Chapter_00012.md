# Chapter 12: Soaring Cloud Sword, Water-Traveling Boat

Yang Ji nodded. Jin Dafu's readily agreeable promise stemmed from his understanding of the difficulty in refining pills. If Yang Ji were truly a master alchemist at this moment, Jin Dafu would certainly not agree to a fifty-fifty split.

Now, he had secured a source for geo-fire and a pill formula, but purchasing the alchemy furnace and spirit herbs would require a large sum of spirit stones, which he currently couldn't afford at all. With a thought, he decided to make a trip out to sea, spend some time acquiring resources, and gather some initial capital. However, before that, he needed to purchase a magical artifact.

He then said, "Elder Jin, please show me your magical artifacts."

"Oh? Little Brother Yang wants to buy a magical artifact?" Jin Dafu chuckled, then pulled him up. "Come, come, come, Little Brother. What grade of magical artifact are you looking for? I'll show you." As they walked, he continued, "We have a complete range of magical artifact styles here: swords, spears, blades, halberds, everything you could imagine."

"Show me your swords," Yang Ji said.

"Alright!" Jin Dafu quickly led Yang Ji to a counter, pointing at the flying swords within. "Our Ten Thousand Treasures Pavilion has a total of six swords: Azure Cloud Sword, Flowing Water Sword, Soaring Cloud Sword, Stabilized Light Sword, Azure Rainbow Sword, and Green Rong Sword."

"Among them, the Flowing Water Sword, Azure Cloud Sword, and Soaring Cloud Sword are low-grade magical artifacts. The Stabilized Light Sword and Green Rong Sword are mid-grade magical artifacts, and the Azure Rainbow Sword is a high-grade magical artifact."

"Low-grade magical artifacts generally sell for one thousand spirit stones, mid-grade for six thousand, and high-grade for ten thousand."

As soon as Yang Ji looked at the counter, he felt waves of austere sword qi emanate from them. Even from two steps away, he could feel their cutting power. All six flying swords shimmered with lustrous light, transparent and seamless, their engraved patterns appearing naturally formed. Evidently, the forging techniques were superb. At a glance, there wasn't a single flaw on the sword bodies, indicating that the materials used were extraordinary.

Due to differences in materials and internal restrictions, these swords gave him distinct sensations: *[Sharpness]*, *[Coldness]*, *[Elegance]*, *[Heaviness]*, and so on.

Seeing him lost in thought, Jin Dafu smiled and offered a suggestion: "Little Brother Yang, you cultivate water-attribute cultivation methods. This Flowing Water Sword is the most suitable for you."

"This one is forged from Flow-Pattern Steel, with six restrictions laid out within the sword body. Once activated by spiritual energy, the sword qi flows, and its power is considerable."

Yang Ji, however, shook his head. He looked at the Flowing Water Sword: *[Low-grade among low-grade magical artifacts. Material: Flow-Pattern Steel. Insufficient forging, contains impurities, inadequate quenching, low hardness. The six internal restrictions have minor flaws, spiritual energy transmission will be obstructed.]*

Although the attributes of this Flowing Water Sword matched his cultivation method, it had too many flaws. It barely qualified as a low-grade magical artifact solely due to the Flow-Pattern Steel and six restrictions; otherwise, it would be a low-tier, inferior product. He couldn't be bothered with this sword; it had too many defects.

Immediately, his gaze shifted to the Azure Cloud Sword and the Soaring Cloud Sword. The former: *[Mid-grade among low-grade magical artifacts. Material: Green Steel Wood. Raw wood soaked in medicinal liquid for forty-nine days, then carved into a sword body. Strong flexibility, not easily broken, but insufficient hardness and penetration power. Six internal restrictions are intact.]*

The latter: *[High-grade among low-grade magical artifacts. Material: Deep Sea Cold Iron, inherently emits cold qi. Due to forging and sharpening, it gives off a chilling sensation.]*
*[Once spiritual energy is injected, activating the six sharp restrictions within the sword body, sword qi will soar into the sky, and cold light will be overwhelming.]*

Seeing this, Yang Ji's eyes lit up. He said to the young girl behind the counter, "Let me see that Soaring Cloud Sword."

"Certainly, Young Master." The girl nodded, her delicate hand wrapped in a handkerchief, slowly presenting the sword.

The sword was three feet three inches long. Its body had no engraved patterns, transparent and luminous throughout, as if meticulously polished from profound ice. Yang Ji took the long sword, running two fingers along its body. He immediately felt a biting cold qi penetrate his fingers.

With a flick of his finger, *Hum!* The sword body emitted a continuous, crisp hum, and a keen sharpness emanated from it.

"What a fine sword!" He couldn't help but murmur. A trace of spiritual energy flowed into the sword, and three inches of sword qi instantly shot out from the tip, piercing the air. "I'll take this sword."

"Little Brother Yang, what keen insight! This sword was forged by a master, and its quality is absolutely top-tier among similar magical artifacts." Jin Dafu chuckled, then paused, adding, "However, the material is a bit inferior. Deep Sea Cold Iron is far less effective than Flow-Pattern Steel. Although six sharp restrictions are laid out within, its sharpness and hardness are still somewhat lacking. I'm afraid it would be difficult to pierce a high-level demonic beast with one strike. Your elder brother here suggests you buy the Flowing Water Sword instead."

Although the Flowing Water Sword's material was good, it had too many flaws that would affect his combat power, so Yang Ji inwardly refused. "This Soaring Cloud Sword and the Soaring Water Art I cultivate both have the character 'Soaring' (凌), making them quite compatible. I'll choose this one," Yang Ji said with a smile, directly paying one thousand spirit stones and putting the flying sword into his storage bag.

Afterwards, Yang Ji's gaze fell upon the Water-Traveling Boat. Unfortunately, he had no spirit stones left and couldn't afford this aquatic magical artifact. He planned to rent an ordinary wooden boat with silver at the dock.

Seeing him look at the Water-Traveling Boat, Jin Dafu frowned. "Little Brother Yang, are you planning to go adventuring at sea?"

"Yes, I plan to make a trip out to sea to acquire some cultivation resources. Otherwise, where would I get the spirit stones to buy spirit herbs and an alchemy furnace?" Yang Ji chuckled.

"But the vast sea is very dangerous. For a small cultivator at Qi Condensation Layer five to rush out like that..." Jin Dafu's brow furrowed slightly, and a thought bubble appeared above his head: *(If you die out in the sea, who's going to help me guard the ship?)*

Seeing the display above his head, Yang Ji really wanted to punch him. Wasn't that a curse? He then laughed, "The sea is vast. I shouldn't be so unlucky as to encounter great horrors right after going out, right?"

"Hey! Little Brother, for safety's sake, I, your elder brother, can make the decision to lend you this Water-Traveling Boat for now." Jin Dafu turned around and quickly retrieved a palm-sized miniature boat from the counter. Its surface was aquamarine, shaped like a shuttle, resembling a submarine from Blue Star (Earth).

"Little Brother, this Water-Traveling Boat is a top-grade item among low-grade magical artifacts, valued at one thousand spirit stones. I'll lend it to you first. When you acquire treasures from your adventure and trade them with me, we can deduct the cost from that. How about it?" Jin Dafu said.

Yang Ji looked at the Water-Traveling Boat: *[Top-grade among low-grade magical artifacts. Internally equipped with three speed restrictions, two transformation restrictions, and one defense restriction.]* Indeed, it was as Jin Dafu had said.

"Little Brother, this Water-Traveling Boat has two transformation restrictions within it."

"When you use it in the future, just inject spiritual energy into it, and this tiny Water-Traveling Boat will quickly enlarge to the size of two people, resembling a shark. It has a camouflage form, capable of luring demonic beasts and spirit fish."

"Sitting inside, you can command it to dive into the seabed for exploration. If you get bored, you can activate another transformation restriction to turn it into a small boat for two, allowing you to drift with the sea without capsizing."

"The other three speed restrictions are for preserving your life and chasing spirit fish or demonic beasts. If you spot a target, you can fully activate these restrictions. Whether you chase or flee will depend on your luck, Little Brother."

"As for the defense restriction, I don't need to say much more, do I, Little Brother?"

As Jin Dafu spoke, he handed the small boat to Yang Ji. Yang Ji touched the fish-scale patterns on the small boat and immediately injected spiritual energy into it. *Hum!* A faint sound was heard, a gentle spiritual light flashed, and the small boat instantly enlarged, standing before Yang Ji like a miniature submarine. He then transformed the boat into its other form; similarly, with a flash of spiritual light, the small boat immediately turned into a sail-less vessel.

"Not bad!" Yang Ji was very satisfied, muttering inwardly, *It seems this Ship-Guarding Envoy still has some use.* He then looked at Jin Dafu and said, "Then I thank you, Elder Jin."

"Hehe, no need to thank me, no need. Since it's your first time at sea, it's best not to go too far. Also..." Jin Dafu paused, then mused, "It's best not to approach unfamiliar cultivators. After all, human hearts are unpredictable, good and evil are hard to distinguish. Not everyone is as pure and honest as I am."
*(I'm really afraid you'll get stabbed by someone, and I'd have lent you a Water-Traveling Boat for nothing.)*

Yang Ji's eyes subtly twitched. *Is this guy really afraid I'll die, or is he just pained about his Water-Traveling Boat?*
