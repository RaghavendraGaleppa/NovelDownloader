## Chapter 34: Qingyuan, Leap of Faith

Wangyue Cliff.

Along the way, Li Mo hadn't actually spent much effort seeking out exotic beasts to slay. No matter how generous the sect's rewards, they surely couldn't compare to the Ice Lump's inheritance. Just listen to that – the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix. Such a high-level opportunity, if not for clinging to the Ice Lump's jade leg, he might have been fated to miss it entirely in this lifetime.

"Truly a sweet deal," he mused.

Lost in thought, Li Mo had already ascended Wangyue Cliff. Looking down from here, it was a ten-thousand-zhang sheer cliff, its depths shrouded in swirling clouds and mist, the bottom entirely unseen. Not even a single bird could be seen.

Qingyuan.

This very place was the origin of the entire Qingyuan Sect. Gazing further into the distance, one would discover that the entire Qingyuan appeared strikingly abrupt. Lacking both beginning and end, it bore no resemblance to a naturally formed geological feature.

"Where is the inheritance ground?"

Li Mo scanned his surroundings but found no trace of the so-called inheritance ground. Indeed. Wangyue Cliff was hardly a remote, rarely visited place. Rumor had it that young couples from Treasure Beast Peak often came here for secret rendezvous, and the sect harbored numerous anecdotes and legends about this very spot. If it were so easily found, it would have been made public long ago.

How then did that Ice Lump discover it? Could it be similar to his experience in Shenfeng Cave, where he felt a connection with that hammer? Was the opportunity here also calling to her?

"Speaking of which, it wouldn't require me to jump from Wangyue Cliff down into the Qingyuan Abyss, would it?"

"How incredibly deep..."

Li Mo walked to the edge of the peak and peered down. Suddenly, his vision blurred momentarily. In the ethereal depths, it was as if a heaven-shaking sword intent had slashed down. The sword intent was like a heavenly punishment descending from the nine heavens, capable of severing any obstruction in this world until its target was utterly annihilated.

In that instant.

Li Mo felt his physical body, honed by the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body, was incredibly fragile, no different from that of a mere mortal.

"Hmph..."

"Qingyuan... was it carved out by a single sword?"

This terrifying thought arose in Li Mo's mind. A sword strike from who knew how many eons ago, its sword intent still lingered to this day. "A single sword's light chills nineteen states." Before this sword intent, that phrase no longer seemed merely descriptive. What kind of mighty expert must have wielded such power?

"In the future, the Ice Lump might also become such an expert, perhaps even stronger than this, right?"

Li Mo recalled the Eye of Heavenly Fate's appraisal of Ying Bing. She was destined to become a supreme expert of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Compared to her now, at least in the Qi-Blood Realm, he shouldn't be lagging too far behind...

Thinking this, young Li sighed: "Why am I not material for practicing swordsmanship?"

"Next time, I'll try again with a better sword..."

...

A slightly chilly wind blew across Wangyue Cliff. Ying Bing tied back her slightly disheveled long hair, her gaze drifting. "The Soaring Heaven Sword Dao is indeed vast and magnificent, its spirit permeating mountains and rivers."

"The master who currently presides over this Dao should still be guarding the Sword Mound, I presume?"

The one who unleashed that sword strike was someone even she, in her prime, would have to face squarely. Later, that master passed the Soaring Heaven Sword Dao to a deposed princess of the Great Yu Dynasty. Coincidentally enough, she had known the female sword immortal, who inherited the Soaring Heaven Sword Dao and later became the foremost sword immortal under the Nine Heavens, since their earliest days. Because in her previous life, she was deemed to have an 'Absolute Meridian,' preventing her from entering the Qingyuan Sect immediately. They had once shared a period of mutual support and navigated challenges together. That was Ying Bing's first time learning the sword.

"Chu Long should also have been demoted to the Eastern Desolate by now."

"But she definitely wouldn't know who I am anymore."

Ying Bing unconsciously let out a faint smile. It was at this moment that she ascended Wangyue Cliff.

"Hmm?"

Seeing Li Mo by the cliff edge, his entire body stained with beast blood, Ying Bing was slightly startled. She had expected Li Mo to still be in Xishi Forest; after all, he might have encountered peak Ninth-Grade exotic beasts further along the path. Even with his twelve-vein Qi-Blood Realm cultivation and perfected swordsmanship, he definitely wouldn't have been able to handle them with ease. Considering how difficult this path was for a Qi-Blood Realm cultivator, she had even specifically given Li Mo an extra hour.

Yet... he had actually arrived earlier than her?

"You're finally here."

Li Mo chuckled, unfazed. It seemed the Ice Lump had an easy journey, not even a single hair out of place. His own clothes were tattered... Alright, he had torn them himself.

"Mm, you should tend to your injuries first. I'll wait."

Ying Bing nodded lightly, comprehension dawning in her mind. Li Mo must not have engaged with any of the exotic beasts along the path. Instead, he had disregarded everything, evaded battle whenever he encountered an exotic beast, and made a direct dash for Wangyue Cliff.

"Heal my injuries?"

Li Mo paused, then chuckled: "I'm not injured. This is all exotic beast blood. If you don't believe me, take a look."

"I encountered two not-too-strong exotic beasts blocking the way, and since I was in a hurry, I didn't pay them much mind."

He took a few steps closer. Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed slightly, and she actually reached out to poke his chest. It really was beast blood. Could it be that he hadn't encountered any trouble along the way, only running into two early Ninth-Grade exotic beasts upon reaching Wangyue Cliff? His luck was perhaps a bit too good. But... this also meant he had given up on the trial.

Ying Bing, of course, didn't care about the sect trial's rewards. But Li Mo, who clearly didn't know why she had summoned him, still chose to come at all costs... Ying Bing looked up and saw his handsome face, radiant with a sunny smile. She found not a trace of complaint or impatience in his brows, only the joy of having fulfilled their agreement on time. It was as if he trusted her implicitly, convinced that her summoning him must have been for a specific reason.

Why? Ying Bing found herself increasingly unable to comprehend this young man.

"Uh..."

Li Mo felt a little uncomfortable. The Ice Lump's finger was still poking his chest. It felt cool and silky...

"Two True Disciples, have I perhaps come at an inopportune moment?"

Suddenly, a jarring, hoarse voice drifted over with the cold wind. Li Mo and Ying Bing turned around almost simultaneously. On the path they had taken, the sole route up Wangyue Cliff, a figure clad in black robes with an iron mask covering his face, had appeared, standing there at some unknown moment.

"I originally only sought True Disciple Li to settle some scores."

"I never expected such an unexpected gain, to find even True Disciple Ying here."

When he mentioned Ying Bing, the black-robed figure's voice trembled, tinged with uncontrollable excitement.

*Whoosh—*

A signal arrow shot through the air. The opponent might as well have plastered the words 'bad guy' across his face. Li Mo naturally didn't waste words with him, immediately summoning help.

Yet the black-robed figure remained unmoved, instead sneering: "True Disciple Li, why don't you use your brain and think? If I hadn't made thorough preparations, would I appear here?"

"Ying Bing, oh Ying Bing, I truly cannot bear to see you become a pair of doomed lovers with him. As long as you..."

*Ring, ring—*

Two chimes echoed. Li Mo expressionlessly shook the Heart-Unison Bell.

"Li Mo!"

Instantly, the black-robed figure's voice changed. If one could see through the mask, they would witness the face beneath it, its expression instantly changing dramatically, breaking out in a sweat. He knew, of course, who that bell would summon!

"You deserve to die!"

Vaguely, only a beast's roar could be heard, echoing endlessly within the Qingyuan Abyss. However, before the opponent could make a move, a flash of sword light had already arrived. The sword intent was bone-chillingly cold, domineering and decisive, making one's hair stand on end. Ying Bing actually hurled her longsword away.

This sword strike, the black-robed figure was confident he could withstand. But he had to admit that Ying Bing's strength far exceeded his imagination; 'genius' was an insufficient term to describe her. If he took it head-on, even as a God-Gazing Realm cultivator, he would suffer injury.

The air fell silent for an instant. The black-robed figure ultimately chose to halt his steps and dodge sideways. However, at this very moment, Ying Bing didn't look at the black-robed man; instead, she met Li Mo's gaze.

"Jump."

Li Mo seemed to realize what she intended to do. Ying Bing suddenly felt she understood this young man even less. This was the unfathomable Qingyuan Abyss. Why did he not show even a flicker of fear? Or was it because of his... trust in her?

"Alright."

Ying Bing had never been one to be hesitant or indecisive. Since Li Mo agreed, although she couldn't comprehend his thoughts, she still pulled his hand without hesitation, stepping into the void. The cold wind instantly turned piercing. Everything around them rapidly blurred. All their senses grew dull...

"You two!!"

On Wangyue Cliff, the black-robed figure rushed forward, his black robe already torn open. He looked down, dumbfounded, at the figures of the young man and woman, hands clasped, disappearing into the clouds and mist. In his eyes, only disbelief remained.
