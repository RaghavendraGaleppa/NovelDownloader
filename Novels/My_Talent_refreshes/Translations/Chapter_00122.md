# Chapter 122: Might of the Bloodfiend Pill

As Yu Jiehui consumed the pill, a faint aura of bloodfiend qi began to emanate from his body, growing denser by the moment. A crimson, malevolent energy started to appear on his hands, quickly enveloping his black shield. The azure sword light, which had been steadily expanding, halted its growth and then gradually dissipated before Chu Ning's eyes. In contrast, the fire blades he had previously unleashed seemed unaffected.

Observing this, Chu Ning mused, his Azurewood Sword Art seemed to have no effect against this bloodfiend qi. Yet, the fire-element spells unleashed by his Blazing Bracelet appeared to be far more effective. With this realization, Chu Ning immediately put away his Divine Wood Longbow. With a sweep of his right hand, he unleashed ten more fire blades. Concurrently, he grabbed a handful of Blazing Fire Talismans, activating them all with a flick of his wrist.

Yu Jiehui watched the sky fill with fire, the bloodfiend qi around him intensifying. He swung the long blade in his hand, a crimson light piercing through the weapon and colliding with Chu Ning's numerous fire-element spells in mid-air. Instantly, over half of the fire blades and Blazing Fire Talisman spells vanished, with only a very small fraction of spells being blocked by his black shield. At the same time, Yu Jiehui charged directly towards Chu Ning, blade in hand.

"You forced me to take the Bloodfiend Pill, damn you!"

This disciple, previously an eighth-layer expert from the Azure Stream Sect's Enforcement Hall, was now shrouded in a crimson mist, appearing like a blood person. Even his azure longblade, clearly a wood-element artifact, had turned blood-red.

In the distance, Xu Runsheng, who was using several talismans to fend off Tan Zhang and Lin Lan, furrowed his brows slightly. "He used the Bloodfiend Pill so soon?" However, when he glanced over and saw Yu Jiehui already charging towards Chu Ning with his blood-red blade, he felt greatly relieved. "I should finish this quickly too!"

With that thought, several intermediate-grade low-tier attack talismans appeared in Xu Runsheng's hand. "Tan Zhang, Deacon Liao Yunming from your pavilion likes you so much, I wonder how many intermediate-grade low-tier talismans he's given you?" As he spoke, Xu Runsheng raised his hand and activated the talismans. Immediately, dozens of golden threads surged forth from each talisman. Soon, hundreds of golden magical threads appeared in the air, then, with a casual flick of Xu Runsheng's finger, they shot towards Tan Zhang and Lin Lan in the distance.

Tan Zhang's face changed drastically at the sight. He rapidly activated several talismans, conjuring layer after layer of protective barriers around his body.

At this moment, Chu Ning, on the other end, watched Yu Jiehui charge towards him, his expression growing more solemn. *It seems that Duan Yanwu, who chased me last time, most likely also took this Bloodfiend Pill. But why is the Bloodfiend Pill Yu Jiehui took completely different from Duan Yanwu's?* Chu Ning's expression was indeed filled with doubt. The Bloodfiend Pill Duan Yanwu had consumed earlier seemed to only greatly increase his speed, allowing him to keep up with Chu Ning's Startling Thunder Steps. However, there didn't seem to be much change in his attack or defense. But the current Yu Jiehui's bloodfiend qi was several times denser, and judging by the might of his attacks, he was even stronger than a ninth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator.

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, Yu Jiehui had already arrived before him. The blood-red longblade slashed down towards Chu Ning. But in the very next instant, Chu Ning, who had been within his line of sight, suddenly vanished.

Startling Thunder Steps! Chu Ning, unwilling to engage Yu Jiehui head-on, directly used Startling Thunder Steps to dodge, simultaneously moving behind Yu Jiehui.

Heavenly Gang Fist! Chu Ning once again employed the Blazing Bracelet combined with the Heavenly Gang Fist. Since fire-element spells were effective against this bloodfiend qi, Chu Ning naturally wouldn't waste the opportunity. As expected, upon contact with the Blazing Bracelet on his fist, the bloodfiend qi around Yu Jiehui rapidly thinned, clearly being burned by the searing flame. What surprised Chu Ning slightly was that the searing flame didn't directly break through the bloodfiend defense. When Chu Ning's Heavenly Gang Fist slammed into Yu Jiehui's back, a faint layer of blood-light still clung to the opponent's body surface. Chu Ning paid it no mind and struck directly!

"Pfft!" A muffled groan rang out. The bloodfiend qi on Yu Jiehui instantly vanished, and he was sent flying directly.

"Bang!" He crashed heavily onto the ground, spitting out a mouthful of vital blood. "You, how could you..." Lying on the ground, Yu Jiehui looked at Chu Ning with utter terror and disbelief. As a disciple of the Yin Demon Sect, he enjoyed resources from two sects. His artifacts and other possessions were naturally superior to those of ordinary Azure Stream Sect disciples. Moreover, he had even used the Bloodfiend Pill to overdraw his vital blood and enhance his cultivation. Yet, under such circumstances, facing a sixth-layer Qi Condensation Chu Ning, he had ended up in such a state. Chu Ning's endless stream of treasures and techniques left Yu Jiehui dumbfounded and utterly despairing. He was astonished, and so was Chu Ning.

After cultivating the Heavenly Gang Fist, Chu Ning could almost guarantee a one-punch kill against enemies if he found the right opportunity. Especially when combined with Startling Thunder Steps and the Blazing Bracelet, its power was greatly enhanced. Even Duan Yanwu, a ninth-layer Qi Condensation disciple of the Yin Demon Sect, had been killed by a single punch from him. Yet, Yu Jiehui had not died directly under his single punch, which was a huge surprise.

Of course, Chu Ning had no time to ponder these things excessively at the moment. With a flick of his hand seal, the Azurewood Sword Art was unleashed again, shooting towards Yu Jiehui.

"Senior Brother Xu, save me..." Seeing this scene, Yu Jiehui was terrified and couldn't help but shout. But before he could finish, the azure light had already arrived, directly severing his head.

However, his scream did attract Xu Runsheng's attention. Just as he was about to break through Tan Zhang's talisman defense, he couldn't help but turn his head, his eyes filled with disbelief. But in the next moment, his pupils contracted sharply. For at that very instant, several sword light spells unleashed by Chu Ning were already hurtling towards him.

Xu Runsheng saw this and, with a raise of his hand, activated a talisman. Immediately, another defensive barrier appeared before Xu Runsheng. At the same time, he took out several more talismans, flicking his wrist to send them flying in two directions, towards Chu Ning and towards Tan Zhang's group. More were directed at Chu Ning. This was because Tan Zhang had already been at a disadvantage under Xu Runsheng's continuous attacks. So at this moment, Xu Runsheng harbored a deep hatred for Chu Ning, who had consecutively killed several of his companions. Of course, on another note, Xu Runsheng had also realized that Chu Ning was definitely not as simple as his displayed sixth-layer Qi Condensation cultivation suggested.

However, Xu Runsheng was still using conventional attacks even at this point. Clearly, even when facing three opponents, he seemed unwilling to use the Bloodfiend Pill. Chu Ning's eyes flickered slightly at the sight. *Comparing talismans? Especially low-tier high-grade ones? I'm not afraid of anyone.* With a thought, Chu Ning's right hand had already grasped several talismans, sending them hurtling towards Xu Runsheng. They were all low-tier high-grade Blazing Fire Talismans.

Xu Runsheng scoffed softly, more talismans appearing in his hand. These were water-element defensive talismans that specifically countered fire. As expected, these blazing spells vanished upon contact. However, in the next moment, what left Xu Runsheng somewhat dumbfounded was that Chu Ning's two hands were each clutching another handful of talismans, activating them once more.

And judging by how he kept retrieving them from his storage bag, he still had more talismans. As expected, in the next moment, Chu Ning grabbed several talismans with each hand and activated them. A sky full of blazing lights assailed Xu Runsheng one after another. This made his face slightly change, as he was exceptionally familiar with the power of talismans. The crucial point was that, judging by this momentum, it was wave after wave, with no pause whatsoever.

"He's just an outer sect disciple, how can he have so many talismans? And they're all such powerful low-tier high-grade talismans; even Tan Zhang and I might not have this many." Xu Runsheng thought to himself, gritting his teeth. He took out an intermediate-grade low-tier talisman from his storage bag and activated it. He fully expected this to be enough for defense. And indeed, it was, at first. However, the talismans in Chu Ning's hands seemed endless. Ten magical flames at a time, interspersed with fire blades from his high-grade artifact. The intermediate-grade low-tier defensive barrier, after enduring so many successive attacks, began to dim rapidly.

On the other end, Tan Zhang's eyes lit up at the sight. He casually took out two talismans and activated them, two azure lights shooting out—they were also intermediate-grade low-tier attack talismans. Xu Runsheng's already tottering protective barrier in front of him could not withstand this onslaught. It instantly shattered.

"You forced me!" Xu Runsheng roared, activating another protective barrier while simultaneously taking a blood-red pill and swallowing it.

Seeing this from afar, Chu Ning's heart slightly clenched. "Sure enough, it's the Bloodfiend Pill again. I wonder what level a ninth-layer Qi Condensation Xu Runsheng will reach after taking it." Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately shouted, "Senior Brother Tan, be careful! He's forcibly raising his cultivation realm, don't hold back!" As he spoke, Chu Ning's hands showed no pause, unleashing several more fire blades.

On the other side, Tan Zhang, prompted by Chu Ning's warning, gritted his teeth and pulled out another talisman. It was an intermediate-grade mid-tier attack talisman. He seemed somewhat reluctant to use it, but seeing Xu Runsheng gradually emanating bloodfiend qi, he still gritted his teeth and activated it directly. However, when he looked up, he was stunned to see that the sixth-layer Qi Condensation disciple from the Outer Affairs Hall, in the other direction, had also taken out and activated a talisman. Judging by its power, it was also an intermediate-grade mid-tier talisman.

Two intermediate-grade mid-tier talismans struck, equivalent to the simultaneous attacks of two Foundation Establishment cultivators. Xu Runsheng's magic barrier naturally couldn't withstand them and shattered instantly. But at the same time, an incredibly dense bloodfiend qi erupted from Xu Runsheng's body. After two such powerful talisman attacks, the bloodfiend qi only thinned slightly; it didn't completely disappear. Xu Runsheng wasn't even affected in the slightest.

"Seeking death!" Xu Runsheng, transformed into a blood person, roared. He unleashed a golden light from his hand, which, the moment it left his grasp, was directly enveloped in blood-light. This golden light shot straight towards Tan Zhang, while Xu Runsheng himself streaked towards Chu Ning.

*Does the Bloodfiend Pill's attack power increase the closer you get?* This thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind as he watched Xu Runsheng's figure turn into a blood-red blur. However, his body showed no hesitation, vanishing from his original spot in a flash. At the same time, not daring to be careless, he squeezed the talisman he held, activating an intermediate-grade mid-tier defensive talisman. His Earth Spirit Bracelet on his left hand was also poised for action. After all, judging by the might of Xu Runsheng's attack, it had already reached a level above late-stage Qi Condensation.

Just as he finished all this, Xu Runsheng's face, filled with surprise and ferocity, appeared before him. Just like Duan Yanwu before him, after taking the Bloodfiend Pill, this person's speed was incredibly fast, actually able to keep up with the Startling Thunder Steps. And at this moment, Chu Ning finally saw clearly the artifact in Xu Runsheng's hand. It was a short awl only two inches long. When it had just struck Tan Zhang, this artifact was clearly a metal-element artifact. But now, it was glowing with a blood-red light.

"Pop!" Xu Runsheng, holding the artifact, slammed into Chu Ning's defensive barrier. The barrier swayed gently but did not break. Clearly, an intermediate-grade mid-tier defensive talisman was not so easily breached.

"An intermediate-grade mid-tier defensive talisman?" Xu Runsheng, glowing with blood-light, his voice filled with surprise. He didn't even carry such a talisman himself. After his initial surprise, Xu Runsheng, holding the short awl, was about to launch another attack. But how could Chu Ning allow him to succeed so easily at this moment? The instant he confirmed that the defensive barrier was fine, Chu Ning's right hand violently struck out.

The fist, imbued with searing flame, directly smashed into Xu Runsheng's body, which was covered in blood-light. The bloodfiend qi, which had already withstood the talisman attacks, rapidly dissipated under the searing flame's assault. Xu Runsheng's blood-shrouded face gradually cleared, revealing an expression of utter horror.

At this moment, he finally understood why Yu Jiehui, who had also taken the Bloodfiend Pill, had died so easily. Realizing this, Xu Runsheng, as Chu Ning's fist slammed down, used the last trace of residual bloodfiend qi to rapidly retreat. This prevented Chu Ning's Heavenly Gang Fist from fully connecting with Xu Runsheng's body. But even so, the bloodfiend qi had completely scattered with that single strike.

Xu Runsheng was just congratulating himself on not being hit by that punch when his pupils suddenly constricted. For as he flew backward, a fork-shaped artifact shot towards him, aimed directly at his throat. Its speed was even greater than his retreat speed. Then, in his utterly shocked gaze, this flying fork vanished from his sight.

"Pfft!"
"Crack!"

Immediately, Xu Runsheng vaguely heard the sound of bones shattering, and a searing sensation surged into his neck. He desperately wanted to look down, but he could no longer do so.

"Bang!" The next moment, Xu Runsheng fell stiffly to the ground.
