# Chapter 142: A Leisurely Half-Day, the Ice Cube Believes the Situation is Secure

As is well known, the "soup" from the Ice Cube is far beyond just being described as poisoned. Li Mo even wondered if he could find a bit of soup within the poison itself.

"Can I not drink it?"
"You have already been drinking it for two days."

Ying Bing furrowed her brows as she looked at him.

"...Two days?"

Li Mo opened his mouth in shock.

"Elder Xue's prescription requires three bowls a day, taken for three full days. Today is the last day."

Ying Bing gently raised the spoon and brought it to Li Mo's lips.

Shocking—the famous Ice Cube actually knew how to take care of someone. Fortunately, no one from her past life who knew her reputation was present; otherwise, they would have been so astonished they might have gouged out their own eyes.

Li Mo: "....."

Summoning his courage, he opened his mouth and drank it. The taste was slightly bitter, but not unpleasant. He finally understood how the thin strand of internal energy in his meridians had recovered. It was all thanks to the Ice Cube feeding him. So, she had been coming to take care of him every day recently?

The room suddenly fell very quiet. Outside the window, the intermittent cries of summer cicadas could be heard, along with the sound of his mother vigorously shaking out a quilt. The rustling sound suggested his father was watering the flowers and plants.

These sounds reached his ears. Previously, Li Mo had always found them noisy, making it impossible to fall asleep again after getting up to use the restroom. But after being away from home for so long, accompanied by the clinking of the spoon against the porcelain bowl, he felt an inexplicable sense of peace.

The sunlight was also pleasant. In the hazy, dust-filled rays, the girl's every eyelash was coated with a crystalline sheen, her gaze clear and spirited, radiating brilliance with every glance.

Our Li Mo is no stranger to grand scenes, yet he couldn't help but be entranced at this moment.

"Your hand."

Ying Bing suddenly spoke.

"Oh, okay."

Li Mo extended his hand. After Ying Bing took it, two streams of internal energy alternated and circulated, just as before, transferring into him to soothe his tangled meridians.

While circulating her energy, she asked, "How do you feel?"

"Soft."

Li Mo rubbed her hand and answered seriously.

"?"

Ying Bing raised her head, her gaze quietly fixed on him.

Li Mo snapped back to reality and coughed lightly. "I can barely use the 'Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh' technique."

"Good."

And so. After many days, the two joyfully and contentedly began their dual cultivation again.

Outside the window, Li Dalong happened to pass by. Seeing the scene inside, he quickly stopped in his tracks.

"Son, you're awake?"

He was just about to greet his son when his mouth was covered by the child's mother, who had rushed over upon hearing the news. Gu Xueqin even used her family's light footwork.

"You blockhead, are you stupid? The child has a thin face."

"Yes, yes, my wife is right."

Li Dalong closed his mouth sheepishly, bent his knees, and only peeked in with half his head visible.

The two of them peered inside,慈祥的 (kindly) smiles spreading across their faces. Whether unconsciously or unable to help it, they started whispering again.

"It's so nice, hehe."
"You see, I told you, since they were little, I felt that Bing'er would be the daughter-in-law of our Li family."
"Good, so good. I watched her grow up too."
"Mo'er has also become sensible. When he was little, he used to pull her hair all the time, and he wouldn't stop even if you beat him."
"After going out and experiencing the world, he's become sensible."
"Bing'er is so powerful now, she's already in the Xuan Dan Realm. As long as she doesn't dislike our son, that's good enough."
"Fortunately, our son is as handsome as me. Sigh, back in the day, I was also a famous handsome young man in the ten miles and eight villages..."

......

Li Mo: "....."

No way. Mom and Dad, you two really don't treat me like a martial artist. To him, even a mosquito flying past was crystal clear, so his parents' "whispering" was practically deafening.

Besides, she has the Heavenly Mandate, and I have a System. We're not any worse than the Ice Cube, right! Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river! What's so great about a Xuan Dan? Just wait until I condense three hundred and sixty-five of them!

Right.

Since he could hear them, then the Ice Cube...

Li Mo looked over and found the girl's jade-like face was calm, but her eyelashes were trembling slightly in the sunlight...

Understood.

I, the one who should配合 your performance, will act as if I see nothing.

Estimating the timing was about right, Li Mo coughed heavily.

"Where are Mom and Dad? I haven't paid my respects to them since returning."

"They..."

Ying Bing's gaze silently shifted towards the window, and she withdrew her fair hand.

Footsteps sounded shortly after.

"Son, did we disturb you?"

Li Dalong and his wife entered from the door.

Li Mo feigned great surprise: "What a coincidence, Mr. Li and Ms. Gu. Speak of the devil."

"Your mother and I were just taking a stroll nearby, yes, just a stroll."

Li Dalong maintained a straight face, his words firm and resolute.

"What a coincidence, I say."
"Who says it isn't, right?"

Old Li and young Li were now evenly matched in their ability to spin a yarn. Even if the father-son duo were to perform a cross-talk show for an hour or two, they could do it without missing a beat.

"Are you feeling better? Elder Xue came to ask about you personally today."

Gu Xueqin sat down beside him, giving her son a thorough once-over.

"I'm pretty much recovered after resting for two days."

Next came the family's round of asking about well-being. Li Mo took out the Earth Vein Spiritual Milk and healing pills he had prepared in advance, along with several words of advice.

Old Li had always had old, lingering injuries and was still stuck at the Internal Qi Realm. When his mother gave birth to him, her body had also been weakened, and she hadn't practiced martial arts since.

The couple were moved, but repeatedly warned him not to do anything illegal, like sneaking into the Qingyuan Sect's treasury to steal things.

Young Li was speechless. Their concerns weren't unfounded; when he was little, he had stolen silver from home to buy popsicles and got a good beating for it.

Ying Bing watched quietly from the side, and an involuntary sense of tranquility and relaxation welled up in her heart. In Li Mo's words, this was called...

"Stealing a leisurely half-day from a fleeting life"?

[Ding—]

At that moment, the System's daily prompt sounded timely.

[Time until the next ranking comparison: 7 days.]

This time, there was finally no need to worry about penalties for defeat. Everything was back on track.

She now possessed the Blood Phoenix Essence, the Rosy Phoenix Soul, and the True Phoenix Feather. The heir of the Yan Heaven Sect and the prince of the Great Yu Dynasty couldn't possibly have so many trump cards at the Internal Qi Realm. Even if he condensed a Xuan Dan, it wouldn't affect her ranking. The reward for first place would definitely be better than that for second.

Thinking of this. Ying Bing, however, found it hard to feel that this was her due. Because a part of the credit belonged to him...

...

Two more days passed.

After Li Mo woke up, he took the miraculous pills from the System space and recovered at an astonishing speed.

Just as he had thought, breaking through and then being reborn indeed brought him the opportunity to break through to the next realm. He began to focus on condensing his Xuan Dan.

As for Ying Bing, she remained at home as usual, only stabilizing her realm every night. Her dual Xuan Dan were now perfectly round and flawless, and the Blood Phoenix Essence had been truly integrated into her foundation.

That day, she had just finished her practice. The vast power of the Blood Phoenix Essence slowly dissipated. When she opened her eyes, she saw several elders of the Qingyuan Sect, led by Shangcang Wencang, looking at her with smiles.

"Dual Xuan Dan, and a great fortune on top of that."
"Once we return to the sect, we will choose an auspicious day for you to enter the main peak's ancestral hall."

Shangcang Wencang spoke with欣慰 (pride).

Ying Bing nodded slightly. She knew these elders had come for other matters.

Qian Bufan spoke up: "Regarding the secret realm, we need to ask you about the situation first."

Ying Bing and Li Mo were not together from beginning to end. Since Li Mo had not yet recovered, they naturally needed to inquire about Ying Bing's experiences.
