# Chapter 162: Demonic Skeleton

The other disciples remained silent, but none of them were convinced. The grudges held in people's hearts are not so easily dispelled.

"Senior Brother Qi, there are traces of Mo Family mechanisms at the southwest corner."

A disciple couldn't help but call out, as if he had seen something unbelievable.

Qi Huan forcefully cut off his thoughts and immediately led the others toward the sound.

When the searchlight illuminated the depression ahead, even the most rebellious Yan Qi sucked in a cold breath. Hundreds of skeletons were spread out in a radial pattern, each skull embedded with a rusted bronze nail. Corroded chains串 these bones into an eerie star chart.

"Demon Suppression Nails!"

After a long while, Qi Huan slowly exhaled, looking at the skeleton closest to his feet. A corroded bronze nail was driven straight into the skull, with terrifying fine cracks spreading all over the bone.

Yan Qi suddenly exclaimed, "Look at that one in the southeast corner!"

The underground river formed a vortex-shaped deep pool here, with half of a giant bronze pillar插在 the pool's edge.

At the end of the chain wrapped around the pillar was locked a pitch-black skeleton over three meters high.

Even though it had been dead for an unknown number of years, the skeleton still maintained a posture of roaring at the sky. The twelve pairs of ribs in its chest cavity were like curved blades pointing toward the dome of the cave. A spiral horn half a foot long grew from its forehead, its surface covered with dark red blood grooves.

Qi Huan's Adam's apple bobbed up and down. When the sole of his boot crushed a tiny finger bone, it made a grating, teeth-clenching sound.

At some point, bean-sized beads of sweat had already formed on his forehead and were dripping down. The cold sweat on his back quickly soaked his clothes.

He raised the searchlight in his hand, illuminating the top of this skeleton's head. The surface of the rusted bronze nail was covered with tadpole-like dark patterns, and emerald green crystals seeped from the cracks at the tail of the nail.

"What is this..."

"It should be the remains of a martial arts master."

"Can a skeleton be this big?"

"Yue Shan is already over two and a half meters tall. I've seen people over three meters tall before. I remember a general from the Great Zhou Dynasty came to the Heavenly Work Cave to ask for a weapon a few years ago, and he was even taller than three meters."

"But look at the horn on that skeleton's head. This isn't something a human can grow."

"Could it be the remains of a demon?"

While the disciples were discussing this, Qi Huan, as if possessed by a ghost, reached out and touched the horn.

The next moment, his body trembled slightly, and he stood frozen like a statue.

The exclamations of the sixteen disciples seemed to be separated by a thousand layers of water curtains. The chilling sensation transmitted from his fingertips rushed straight to his mind along his meridians.

The horn actually turned into a liquid-like substance the moment he touched it. Dark red patterns, like living things, climbed up his arm, weaving a ferocious ghost totem under his skin.

"Senior Brother Qi!"

Yan Qi's anxious voice accompanied a crossbow bolt that shot past his ear and hit the rock wall. He wanted to blast the remains apart, but he didn't expect the bolt to spark against the bone remains. The remains didn't shatter; instead, the fine steel crossbow bolt broke into pieces.

But the world in Qi Huan's eyes had completely twisted. The underground river turned into a surging sea of blood, and every skeleton opened its empty eye sockets and roared.

"Why?! Why does loyalty not earn trust! After pouring my heart and soul into the Heavenly Work Cave for so many years, to be denied because of this one matter?"

Waves of blood beat against the embankment built of skeletons. Each skeleton transformed into the faces of fellow disciples familiar to Qi Huan.

He saw the skull of the Mo Family Hall Master, Chu Xu, open its jawbone, and the corroded bronze false teeth collide to make a piercing, mocking sound: "A dog from the Hidden Blade Pavilion dares to touch the Heavenly Work Diagram?"

A skull floating nearby suddenly grew the face of his master, and a shrill cry squeezed out from a broken larynx bone: "You thought that kneeling and licking the blade would cleanse your bloodline? You are my disciple. Do you think they would treat you as before, regarding you as the most talented disciple in the Heavenly Work Cave?

You're wrong, completely wrong. That Xu Yunfan is now being treated like a star held in the palms of all hands. The hall masters of various departments are all looking at him with eager eyes. And you? You're like a rat in a gutter, ignored by everyone!"

"When the Foundry Hall was first established, who stood guard over its territory for seven days and nights without rest!"

Qi Huan's roar shattered the blood waves, but more scenes emerged from the fragments. As he呕着血 marked the weaknesses of the mechanisms on the ink diagram, Mo Han was using his merit list as a coaster for a teacup;

When he led the disciples to defend the Ghost Cry Abyss fissure, the Punishment Hall disciples were stuffing incriminating letters into his bedroom.

"No, that's not what I did, it wasn't me! I didn't!! What did you stuff into my memories?!"

Qi Huan clutched his head, stumbling backward with a ferocious expression. The veins on his temples bulged under his skin, as if they were about to tear apart at any moment.

A giant bronze mirror rose from the sea of blood, and the scene of the victory banquet at the Ghost Cry Abyss three days ago reappeared in the mirror.

Qi Huan saw himself standing outside the hall on the stone steps, holding a congratulatory gift. The sweat-soaked Hidden Blade Pavilion礼服 clung to his back. The disciples passing by treated him as if he didn't exist; the respect he used to receive was gone.

"Senior Brother Xu is here!"

"Senior Brother Xu has come!"

He turned his head and saw Xu Yunfan, carrying the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, being surrounded by a crowd of disciples like stars surrounding the moon as he walked into the banquet hall.

The sound of Mo Han's loud laughter came from inside the hall.

"Remove the seats for the Hidden Blade Pavilion. Their chief disciple probably prefers to stay in the dark..."

The mirror surface suddenly splashed with blood. Those blood droplets coalesced into images of the sixteen guards having their weapons taken away. Yan Qi, protecting his severed wrist, screamed with a tragic expression.

"Senior Brother Qi! They said our sword chests would offend the honored guests!"

"The Nine-Link Chain Crossbow I designed myself—you just changed the pattern and called it the Heavenly Work Cave's heritage!"

Qi Huan's玄钢剑劈开了 the blood mirror, but the fragments turned into thousands of edicts with barbs.

The vermilion characters on the edicts dripped with poison: "Those of the Hidden Blade Pavilion shall never hold power in the core departments for eternity."

He recognized this as the opening line of the "Admonition of Loyalty and Righteousness," which he had copied three hundred times on his birthday last year.

A rotten hand suddenly reached out from the pile of bones, its palm holding a still-beating heart.

The demon's bewitching voice mixed with the pulsing of his blood: "Look at the fellow disciples you protected. When they ate the glutinous rice dumplings at the victory banquet, did they leave even a single grain for the dog who was eliminating evil spirits in the gutter?"

The demonic skeleton suddenly rose, and its pitch-black bone claw pierced his chest and grasped the beating heart.

In the agony, Qi Huan heard a genderless whisper: "Do you want the power to take revenge? Take back everything you have lost, fairly and squarely. Since they won't give it, then you must seize it. If they are unwilling, then you must take it. Whoever opposes you, kill them. Those who follow you will prosper; those who oppose you will perish!

Can you smell it? The delicious spiritual energy rising from the earth's veins. All of this will grant you supreme power!"

"Senior Brother Qi!!"

In reality, the sixteen disciples watched as Qi Huan suddenly fell to his knees. The other six swords of varying lengths, which had shot out from his sword chest, hummed and actually suspended themselves in mid-air, surrounding Qi Huan in a circle.

This scene made all the disciples stop in their tracks, their faces filled with shock.

Yan Qi couldn't hold back and stepped forward.

The six suspended swords suddenly emitted a piercing hum, and the wave patterns on the sword ridges glowed with a dark red blood light.

Yan Qi's fingertips were still three inches from Qi Huan's shoulder when the longsword that had left its string pierced through his throat.
