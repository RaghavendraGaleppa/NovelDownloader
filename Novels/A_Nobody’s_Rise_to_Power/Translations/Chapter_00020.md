# Chapter 20: The Gate of Righteousness

Since returning from the foot of Panshan Mountain, Yi She had been in a state of deep depression.

He felt that if he hadn't tried to show more respect for the Clan Leader than the First and Second Stewards, arriving at Phoenix Mountain days early for the heir's wedding, he wouldn't have been sent to receive the coffin. If he hadn't been sent to receive the coffin, he wouldn't have interrogated that horse thief and learned a secret he dared not speak of.

But now that he knew, he couldn't pretend ignorance. He had no choice but to grit his teeth and report to the Clan Leader.

Truly, hoping to stay out of it was just his wishful thinking...

When he walked into the Hall of Bright Virtue, the rain was almost stopping, but Steward Yi's heart was still damp and chaotic.

He knew that the grand performance orchestrated by the Clan Leader and the Second Master of the Suo family was meant to kill several birds with one stone, and he was one of those birds.

The Clan Leader wanted to use this public occasion to force him to choose a side.

As long as he personally said, "Yu Huanhu is the murderer who killed the Young Master," even if he added the qualifier "according to the horse thief's confession," he would be forced to side with the Clan Leader.

But Steward Yi didn't want to take sides; he wanted to struggle a bit more.

Therefore, upon entering the Hall of Bright Virtue, Yi She did his best to evade and spoke ambiguously, hoping Yu Huanhu would see his perfunctory attitude and not regard him as an enemy.

However, Steward Yi's evasion greatly dissatisfied Yu Xinglong. Was it really impossible to force Yi She to actively side with him? Was this Clan Leader, in the eyes of his retainers, truly so unworthy of allegiance?

Seeing Yu Xinglong's face growing increasingly grim and Suo Hong pressing him aggressively, Steward Yi could no longer hold out and resorted to "diverting the disaster."

Yi She said, "Second Master Suo, since you said that it was Elder Tu who personally heard it and then reported it to the Young Mistress, why not ask the Young Mistress to come here and clarify? I was merely following the Clan Leader's orders to receive the coffin. I am unclear about the details of the Young Master's murder, and I only interrogated that horse thief once briefly. I truly have nothing more to say."

Yu Huanhu said coldly, "I didn't know my niece-in-law thought I was the murderer of her husband. Clan Leader, why not have her come? I want to ask her face to face!"

The rain had stopped. Yang Can pushed open the window, and a fresh breeze after the rain rushed in.

The apricot blossoms were even more enchanting after the rain, a tree full of charm.

Suddenly, Suo Chanzhi was seen walking out from the inner gate, accompanied by two wet nurses and two young maids in blue.

She had already changed out of her hemp mourning clothes. The residents of Longshang were deeply influenced by nomadic tribes and did not have the custom of observing a mourning period.

Among the many ethnic groups in Longshang, there were some who killed their wives to be buried with them, and others who allowed immediate remarriage, but there was no concept of mourning.

Therefore, Suo Chanzhi was currently only unsuited to wear overly bright and ostentatious clothing like bright reds and purples; otherwise, it didn't matter much.

Her attire was now primarily a combination of black and white, which set off her bright eyes and white teeth, making her exceptionally beautiful and pure.

Suo Chanzhi walked gracefully along the flagstone path. When her eyes met Yang Can's, her gaze dimmed slightly before she walked past, looking straight ahead.

It was the young maid in blue behind her, Qing Mei, who, taking advantage of the moment when no one was paying attention, shot Yang Can a meaningful glance.

It wasn't a flirtatious look; it meant she had something to say to him.

Yang Can's heart skipped a beat. The moment he had been waiting for had finally arrived!

The plaque "Hall of Bright Virtue" still shone golden after the rain.

When the Young Mistress, Suo Chanzhi, walked into the Hall of Bright Virtue, everyone in the hall looked at her.

Everyone's gaze unconsciously fell on the Young Mistress's abdomen.

The situation regarding the direct line of the Yu Clan's eldest branch was now extremely delicate.

According to reason, with the heir apparent dead, this branch could be dissolved.

However, no one could be certain yet whether Yu Chengye was truly without an heir.

They needed to see if the Young Mistress was pregnant, but that would take another half month.

Right now, even a highly skilled physician could not detect a pulse.

If the Young Mistress was pregnant, then everyone would have to wait another nine months to determine whether she gave birth to a boy or a girl.

This feeling of opening a blind box was quite... exciting.

However, at a glance, at least for now, the Young Mistress's waist was still slender and delicate, with no sign of pregnancy at all.

As soon as Suo Chanzhi arrived, she began recounting the events from the day Yu Chengye was murdered.

At the time, the entire wedding procession was setting up camp, so the formation was scattered and the defense was at its weakest.

The timing of the horse bandits' ambush coincided perfectly with this optimal moment.

This gave people the feeling that there really was an insider providing information, colluding from within.

She then mentioned that many of the Suo family's dowry goods were scattered and piled within the camp.

Because they were to be loaded onto carts and set off early the next morning, these goods had not been moved to the center of the camp.

But the horse bandits, who should have been there for wealth, ignored these goods and went straight for the center of the camp.

After killing Yu Chengye, they immediately began to break out. The goods they carried away were taken casually as they fled.

Although Suo Chanzhi's words did not explicitly state that Yu Huanhu was the murderer, these种种 anomalies, combined with the horse thief's confession, were almost equivalent to pointing directly at Yu Huanhu's nose and calling him the killer.

Yu Huanhu said with a dark expression, "Niece-in-law, there were no horse bandits attacking at the foot of Panshan Mountain. Who killed your Suo family's Elder Tu?"

Suo Chanzhi shook her head. "Niece-in-law is also deeply puzzled by this. To be honest, Elder Tu was just a dowry servant by my side. Who would kill her, and why?"

Yu Huanhu laughed angrily. "Niece-in-law, your Second Uncle has underestimated you. Your tongue is truly sharper than a sword!"

Suo Chanzhi's eyes filled with tears as she said mournfully, "Niece-in-law is merely stating everything she knows and saw in front of the clan elders. The one who lost her husband is niece-in-law; the one who, just after marrying, must bear the inauspicious name and remain a widow for life is also niece-in-law. Second Uncle, do you think niece-in-law has any reason to wrong you?"

At this point, two streams of clear tears finally fell from Suo Chanzhi's eyes.

Everyone in the hall was moved by her words. Yes, the one who should hate the true culprit the most should be the bride. Even if she was deceived and her accusation was false, one couldn't say she had ulterior motives.

Yu Huanhu laughed sorrowfully to the sky. "Hahaha! Niece-in-law, you have no reason to wrong me, but how wronged am I?

According to what you said, my nephew was staying in the center of the camp, protected by your Suo family's guards.

So tell me, what means could I use to bribe someone from your Suo family to be my insider?

The murder of Elder Tu is even more bizarre. What person, and for what reason, would kill your Suo family's steward nurse?

At that time, there shouldn't have been anyone from our Yu family in the center of the camp, right?"

Hearing this, Suo Chanzhi's beautiful eyes turned盈盈ly towards Steward Yi.

She didn't speak, but her eyes seemed to speak.

Steward Yi, who had just been secretly congratulating himself on finally escaping the whirlpool with the "diverting the disaster" strategy, turned pale. *No, are they coming for me again?*

The Clan Leader wanted to use this matter to force him to take sides, the Second Master Suo was stirring up trouble, and now the Young Mistress wasn't letting him go either. He...

Meeting the suspicious gazes of some branch heads and elders, the panicked Steward Yi suddenly thought of another person.

Master Yang!

Yang Can had once said that the Suo family was the most suspicious in the death of the Young Master.

That was nonsense, of course. What reason would the Suo family have to kill the Young Master?

However, at this moment, it wouldn't hurt to pull him out to block the attack.

With that reckless fellow stirring things up inside, wouldn't he be able to extricate himself again?

Steward Yi immediately employed the "diverting the disaster" strategy again, cupping his hands towards Yu Xinglong and saying, "Clan Leader, this retainer suddenly thought of a person. Regarding the death of the Young Master, this person holds a different view."

When Yang Can stood before the entrance of the Hall of Bright Virtue, the spring light was bright.

The wind was fresh, carrying the scent of spring grass and flowers.

The three gilded characters "Hall of Bright Virtue" on the lintel shone brilliantly.

The bronze threshold on the ground was over a foot high, polished and gleaming.

Yang Can took a deep breath and stepped over that golden, shining bronze threshold.

He stepped over with his left foot first.

Everyone in the Hall of Bright Virtue looked at Yang Can at that moment.

At that instant, it was as if the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and Vajras in a sacred mountain temple were all looking at a little monk coming in to offer incense; the invisible pressure was immense.

Suo Chanzhi sat in the seat originally belonging to the heir apparent, Yu Chengye. She only glanced at Yang Can before quickly retracting her gaze.

There were too many people here, and each was a seasoned veteran. She was afraid someone would notice something.

Yu Xinglong said in a deep voice, "Yang Can, you were my son Chengye's guest advisor and also the groomsman for his wedding. Chengye was unfortunately murdered by villains, and the true culprit is still shrouded in mystery.

"I have heard that you have a different view on Chengye's murder. Now, in front of my Yu family members and Second Master Suo, state your opinion."

"This one obeys!"

Yang Can bowed deeply to Yu Xinglong at the head of the hall and walked calmly to the center of the Hall of Bright Virtue, standing firm.

Was he nervous? Of course he was.

But his nervousness wasn't because of the people in the hall.

His unease was due to a lack of corresponding experience.

How much experience did Yang Can have in his past life? Although most of it was seen online, indirect experience is still experience.

Moreover, to step onto this Hall of Bright Virtue today, he had privately rehearsed it countless times and built up his mental fortitude many times.

He was nervous only because the correctness of his "taking a bypath" would be verified today!

Yang Can stood firm and said, neither humbly nor arrogantly, "Clan Leader, Second Master Suo,各位 branch heads and elders, this one was favored by the Young Master and brought in as a guest advisor. This time, I accompanied the Young Master to Jincheng to fetch the bride and served as a groomsman, following him the entire way..."

Yang Can began speaking from the moment they left Jincheng with the bride, Suo Chanzhi. He described how the Suo family members acted arrogantly, took charge of everything, and acted arbitrarily regarding the march and camp setup.

He even mentioned that during rest and defense, the guards protecting the Young Master up close were all from the Suo family. Aside from him, a scholar with no martial ability, all the Yu family members were forbidden from approaching the center of the camp...

Some of what Yang Can said had already been mentioned by Suo Chanzhi, but some had not.

However, even for the things Suo Chanzhi had mentioned, because the two had different stances and positions, their interpretation and description of the same event were completely different.

According to Suo Chanzhi, the many unreasonable points seemed to point the suspicion of the true culprit towards Yu Huanhu.

But now, from Yang Can's perspective, the Suo family became the biggest suspect.

For a moment, the Second Master of the Yu Clan, Yu Huanhu, looked at Yang Can with a much gentler gaze.
