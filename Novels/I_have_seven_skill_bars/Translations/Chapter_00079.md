# Chapter 79: Flowers Bloom and Intelligence Awakens

Ding Rui had been busy all day, not returning to his 520 spirit field until late at night. He then slept soundly until dawn.

The next morning, after waking up, he immediately walked into his spirit field.

The Meridian Flowers he had planted earlier had finished rooting and moved past their rapid growth phase, now rapidly approaching their flowering period.

"It'll be in the next day or two," Ding Rui thought to himself, looking at the budding flower calyxes at the tips of the branches and leaves.

He wasn't nervous about this; rather, he felt a faint sense of anticipation.

After tending to the Meridian Flowers in this small plot of spirit field, Ding Rui immediately began working on the Meridian Flowers planted by the sect.

With the blessing of his [Double Deep Pit] skill, he loosened the soil for these rapidly growing Meridian Flowers with extreme speed.

And these Meridian Flowers grew quickly, often several inches in a single day, so loosening the soil needed to be done daily to prevent the soil below from compacting again and affecting their growth.

Before noon, Ding Rui had finished tending to all the Meridian Flowers in his 520 spirit field.

He routinely walked out of the spirit field, intending to leave 520 and head to the other spirit fields he was responsible for.

But at that very moment, a subtle "buzzing" sound suddenly reached Ding Rui's ears.

He paused his steps, momentarily failing to react.

However, the "buzzing" sound grew louder and louder, and moments later, it erupted like a bomb detonating in deep water.

"Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz..."

The entire spirit field was now filled with Meridian Flowers, but even the ones he had planted first hadn't bloomed yet, so where would the bees find anything to eat?

"Uh..."

Ding Rui thought for a moment, just about to comfort the Qingfeng Xia in front of him, when suddenly, one of them flew upwards, its tone becoming light: "Found it!"

Ding Rui immediately looked puzzled.

Found what?

Then he saw all the bees flying towards a certain direction in the spirit field.

He looked over there and immediately saw that the patch of Meridian Flowers he had planted earlier had actually bloomed!

They lay like a deep purple ribbon spread across the spirit field.

What a coincidence!

It seemed like an ordinary day.

The Qingfeng Xia had successfully awakened their intelligence, and these Meridian Flowers had finally bloomed.

These two events had coincidentally aligned perfectly.

Ding Rui walked closer to that small patch of spirit field and watched.

The Qingfeng Xia had only just awakened their intelligence, and their overall number was far less than that of the bee-cultivator bees before.

They couldn't even manage to gather from this small patch of Meridian Flowers.

Ding Rui felt a little uneasy; Jiang She had arrived too suddenly, and he hadn't had a chance to tell the Qingfeng Xia to stop.

He walked up to Jiang She, intending to explain, but Jiang She spoke first, frowning, "Are you perhaps planning to use bee-cultivators to process Meridian Flowers during their flowering period? That's quite useless. To keep Meridian Flowers in bloom, you have to work on them from within."

Seeing that Jiang She wasn't angry, Ding Rui understood that the Qingfeng Xia collecting nectar wouldn't have a significant impact on the Meridian Flowers' yield. Nevertheless, he explained, "Senior Brother, these are the Qingfeng Xia, the bee-cultivators of my spirit field. They just awakened their intelligence today, and I haven't told them not to collect Meridian Flower pollen, so they don't know any better."

Jiang She glanced at Ding Rui and smiled, "The amount of Meridian Flower pollen collected by bee-cultivators is extremely small and won't affect the overall harvest. That's fine. I came to see how you plan to deal with Meridian Flowers during their flowering period. Are you ready?"

Ding Rui didn't dare to promise too much, saying, "This junior brother will try his best, but... there shouldn't be any problems... right?"
