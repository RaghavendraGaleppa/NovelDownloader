# Chapter 151: Yellow Spring Soil

Half a month later, Zhou Qing and Yuan Mingyue returned to the Water Manor from the Divine Water Palace.

Reflecting on their journey to the Divine Water Palace, Zhou Qing considered bringing Yuan Mingyue along a wise decision. With the addition of the All-Seeing Eye and the Primordial Heavy Water, only one special water curtain in the Divine Water Palace remained inaccessible to him—everywhere else was now open to him.

Moreover, Zhou Qing had found the Three Radiance Divine Water, a new batch of Longevity Jade Liquid, and a medicinal garden suitable for Golden Core cultivation.

Now, all he needed was to locate an extreme Yin Earth Fiend site to refine the Samadhi Divine Fire, after which he could begin crafting the Immortality Elixir.

Additionally, Zhou Qing had discovered a divine ability to manipulate the Primordial Heavy Water—"Water Dragon's Chant."

With the second layer of Primordial Heavy Water as its core, it could gather vast amounts of water-attribute spiritual energy. There was also another divine ability called the Frost Soul Divine Light.

This technique shared similarities with the "Frost Overwhelms the World" spell but was far more powerful.

"Unfortunately, the Divine Water Palace doesn't have the soul attack technique I've been seeking. Such divine abilities are exceedingly rare. They're only commonly found in the spiritual cultivation lineages," Zhou Qing mused silently.

Furthermore, Zhou Qing deduced that the most important secret of the Divine Water Palace likely lay behind the water curtain in the Divine Water Hall.

The reason Zhou Qing couldn't pass through that curtain was that it was entirely composed of third-layer Primordial Heavy Water. Without Nascent Soul-level strength, breaching it was impossible.

Fortunately, the existence of that water curtain provided Zhou Qing with a tangible reference for cultivating the third layer of Primordial Heavy Water in the future. Once his strength was sufficient, he could even attempt to refine it.

For now, though, he had to focus on steadily cultivating the second layer of Primordial Heavy Water.

With the medicinal plants from the Divine Water Palace's Golden Core garden, while he couldn't yet refine the Immortality Elixir, he could attempt to craft some daily-use spiritual pills for Golden Core cultivators to aid in his cultivation.

Zhou Qing consumed these pills to purify his Yin-Yang Divine Light, using it to temper his Golden Core Path. Simultaneously, he practiced the "Frost Soul Divine Light" and "Water Dragon's Chant."

Once these two divine abilities were mastered, combined with his Yin-Yang Divine Light and the Divine Thunder Sword Control True Art, he could confidently escape even from late Golden Core opponents.

Though he had previously frightened off the three great demon kings, that had been by leveraging Patriarch Xuan Tian's prestige.

Had the three demon kings dared to fight to the death, Zhou Qing's bluff would have been exposed.

However, the higher one's cultivation, the less willing they were to gamble with their lives.

Behind the water curtain in the Divine Water Palace lay the true core of the palace, the key to controlling it. Though Zhou Qing couldn't yet control the Divine Water Palace, he could enter it anytime using the Black Water Divine Stele.

Still, Zhou Qing preferred to remain in the Water Manor.

---

During his time in the Divine Water Palace, he had inexplicably felt as if he was being watched.

Fortunately, this sensation dissipated as soon as he left.

He suspected that some terrifying entity might be sealed within the Divine Water Palace.

Five years passed in the blink of an eye.

...

"Greetings, Alliance Leader." Qin Fang, the sect master of the Blood Demon Sect, arrived at Desolate Ridge.

Zhou Qing returned the greeting.

Qin Fang brought good news: they had located an extreme Yin Earth Fiend site. If the information was accurate, it would fill the final gap in Zhou Qing's Green Sun Spirit Fire, allowing him to refine his own Samadhi Divine Fire.

The extreme Yin Earth Fiend site would produce the Stone-Centered Fire, also known as the Extreme Yin Earth Fiend Divine Fire.

"This soil was brought back by one of our disciples from that location. I suspect it's not just an ordinary extreme Yin Earth Fiend site—it might be connected to the Yellow Spring Path."

The Yellow Spring Path was the origin of spiritual cultivators, said to be the road connecting life, death, and reincarnation.

Zhou Qing took the small amount of soil, which was a dark yellow. As soon as it touched his hand, an extremely Yin-cold energy seeped into his body.

But his Five Elements circulation naturally refined this energy.

"It seems this is indeed the legendary Yellow Spring Soil. Its Yin-cold energy has strong corrosive properties," Zhou Qing concluded accurately.

Yellow Spring Soil was unique to the Yellow Spring Path.

The Blood Demon Sect disciple who had brought it back had rapidly aged.

This disciple had been at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, yet even he couldn't withstand the corrosive Yin-cold energy.

"If that place is truly part of the Yellow Spring Path, only a spiritual cultivator can enter. But the last spiritual cultivator in the Jingyang Dao Domain was killed by Patriarch Xuan Tian," Zhou Qing thought.

---

The Yellow Spring Path was tied to the rules of heaven and earth's reincarnation and was only suitable for spiritual cultivators.

It seemed the extreme Yin Earth Fiend site's emergence was related to the Yellow Spring Path.

"I must thank Fellow Daoist Qin for finding this extreme Yin Earth Fiend site," Zhou Qing expressed his gratitude before seeing Qin Fang off.

To enter the extreme Yin Earth Fiend site, Zhou Qing needed to make additional preparations.

The Yellow Spring Path's natural laws didn't reject spiritual cultivators.

Zhou Qing thought of the Tiger Demon Bright King.

The esoteric traditions and spiritual cultivation shared the same roots.

At the same time, Zhou Qing planned to use Thousand Illusions to simulate a spiritual cultivator's aura.

Currently, the Dao Court had one spiritual cultivator.

---

Li Anping, the former leader of the Anping Dao, had the potential to become a spiritual cultivator. He had now joined the Dao Court as an overseer and, after obtaining esoteric techniques in the Snow Domain, had become a spiritual cultivator.

"Greetings, True Person Zhou." Li Anping was stationed in the Snow Domain, where he focused on cultivation and occasionally assisted the spiritual tea tree in purging the lingering ghosts and spirits there.

He was a valuable aide to Xiao Ruowang.

Given the dangers of being a spiritual cultivator, Zhou Qing had implanted a soul curse mark using the Tiger Demon Bright King after Li Anping's transformation. As long as Li Anping didn't commit evil in the mortal realm, the mark wouldn't affect him.

Zhou Qing inquired about his cultivation progress, observing Li Anping with the All-Seeing Eye.

This made Li Anping nervous.

He hadn't been a cult leader for years—True Person Zhou knew that.

But Li Anping had also achieved something most Dao Court disciples could only dream of: spending an entire month alone with True Person Zhou.

"You actually have a talent for talisman crafting. If you're interested, you could explore it further," Zhou Qing said, patting Li Anping's shoulder before leaving.

---

Back in the Water Manor, the Tiger Demon Bright King within Zhou Qing's body roared incessantly. His spiritual cultivator aura grew increasingly dense, and his appearance began to change.

He didn't take on Li Anping's form, but his aura was strikingly similar.

The more he used Thousand Illusions, the more he sensed its potential wasn't limited to transformation and aura concealment.

It could evolve further.

"Thousand Illusions, combined with body refinement, might ultimately evolve into something akin to the ancient divine demons," Zhou Qing thought.

"Divine Demon Transformation?"

At his current level, Zhou Qing could tell that Thousand Illusions' creator hadn't intended it as a mere concealment technique.

Though the ancient divine demons had mysteriously perished, one of their defining traits was their indestructible physical forms.

Indestructibility was the ultimate pursuit of cultivators.

---

Zhou Qing understood that throughout history, cultivators had sought countless paths to transcend life and death. Qi cultivation and body refinement were merely two broad categories among these paths, and they weren't entirely separate.

They were intertwined.

Currently, Zhou Qing and Jingyang Zhenren were among the best at balancing both.

But there were differences between them.

After cultivating the Yin-Yang Treasure Vessel Body and refining the Yin-Yang Divine Light, Jingyang Zhenren could shatter all techniques and divine abilities with a single strike of his divine light.

In contrast, Zhou Qing's approach was more eclectic.

The essence of the Yin-Yang Treasure Vessel was the vessel itself—using Yin and Yang energies to refine all things.

Zhou Qing, however, used the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace to refine his Golden Core, melting diverse elements into his Golden Core Path.

Jingyang Zhenren shattered all techniques.

Zhou Qing's path was to melt all techniques into one.

Thus, he could also cultivate the Yin-Yang Divine Light, integrating it into his myriad techniques.

But it still couldn't match the purity of Jingyang Zhenren's approach.

Overall, Jingyang Zhenren leaned more toward the path of extremes.

Zhou Qing speculated that this extreme path might be why Jingyang Zhenren had disappeared. There must have been some flaw he needed to resolve.

"The foundation of the world is the Five Elements. With my Dao Furnace, I've refined the Five Elements True Body, making it natural to melt all techniques into one. There's no hierarchy among paths—what matters is who can walk the furthest."

Though his Supreme Unity Primordial Chaos Divine Light could shatter all Five Elements techniques, its greatest feature was immunity to them.

As long as an opponent's technique fell within the Five Elements, Zhou Qing could use the Supreme Unity Primordial Chaos Divine Light to defend against it, neutralizing much of its power even if the opponent's cultivation surpassed his.

The Supreme Unity Primordial Chaos Divine Light was more defensive than offensive.

In contrast, the Yin-Yang Divine Light was purely offensive, breaking through all techniques with relentless force.

"If the Supreme Unity Primordial Chaos Divine Light could be perfected and cultivated to its peak, its greatest feature would be immunity to all techniques, not just those of the Five Elements," Zhou Qing mused.

Wrapping the Yin-Yang Divine Light with the Supreme Unity Primordial Chaos Divine Light, he felt a profound harmony between the two. They were mysteriously connected.

If the two could truly merge, they might even form the "Supreme Unity Primordial Chaos Five Elements Yin-Yang Annihilation Divine Light."

Zhou Qing chuckled to himself.

Using Thousand Illusions to assume the form of a spiritual cultivator, he stealthily approached the Yin Fiend site Qin Fang had mentioned.

The site was only a thousand miles from Xuan Tian City, located in a bottomless chasm.

With Thousand Illusions concealing his aura, Zhou Qing descended into the chasm.

After descending just a few miles underground, he found traces of the Yellow Spring Soil.

And he sensed the aura of the Yellow Spring.
