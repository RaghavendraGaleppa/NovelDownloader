# Chapter 12: Ambush  

"Disregarding an elder's advice will only lead to regret!"  

Qin Chong immediately sensed something amiss. Zhao Yin wouldn't have warned him without reason, yet he couldn't pinpoint the exact problem at the moment.  

Still, he decided to heed Zhao Yin's suggestion.  

Find a place to hide? Suddenly, Qin Chong thought of the perfect location. After flying a short distance, he changed course toward the Flying Cloud Waterfall.  

After a day of flight, he was already close to his destination.  

Just then, a figure abruptly appeared, blocking his path. The man wore a coarse gray Daoist robe, his burly frame concealed beneath it, with only a pair of sharp, piercing eyes visible behind a black cloth mask. His cultivation was at the sixth layer of Qi Refinement—half a step into the late-stage of the realm.  

The sheer killing intent radiating from those eyes sent a chill down Qin Chong's spine.  

"I heard you made quite the haul at Gourd Valley. I’d like to borrow your storage pouch," the man said in a low, grating voice that scraped unpleasantly against the ears.  

Damn it! A robbery and murder disguised as a polite request?  

A buzzing sound followed as the man summoned a black flying sword—a mid-grade magical artifact. In an instant, the sword expanded to over ten feet in length, transforming into a streak of black light that shot toward Qin Chong.  

The distance between them was barely thirty feet. Even if Qin Chong tried to flee now, he wouldn’t make it. Turning his back would only leave him vulnerable to a fatal strike before he could even raise a defense.  

With no other choice, Qin Chong summoned his Black Iron Shield, channeling his spiritual energy to hold it firmly before him.  

The attacker’s eyes flickered with surprise at the sight of the shield, but it was quickly replaced by a surge of killing intent.  

"Not bad. You even have a defensive artifact!"  

**BOOM!**  

The black sword slammed into the shield with terrifying force. The impact sent Qin Chong skidding backward uncontrollably, his boots carving deep furrows into the ground before he finally steadied himself several yards away.  

He dared not relax his grip on the shield, pouring every ounce of his remaining energy into maintaining its defense.  

Though their cultivation levels differed by only a single layer, Qin Chong knew he was hopelessly outmatched. The gap wasn’t just in raw power or equipment—the sheer bloodlust radiating from his opponent was suffocating.  

This kind of killing aura wasn’t something one developed casually. Only those who had spent years slaughtering beasts or cultivators of equal or higher strength could exude such a presence.  

This man was a seasoned killer. Under normal circumstances, a novice like Qin Chong wouldn’t last more than a few exchanges.  

To put it bluntly, if the attacker had gone all-out from the start, Qin Chong would already be dead.  

The fact that he had barely survived the first strike meant his opponent either underestimated him or hadn’t expected him to possess a defensive artifact—even if it was only a low-grade one.  

In terms of value, a low-grade defensive artifact was roughly equivalent to a mid-grade offensive one.  

But in actual combat, the difference was stark. The Black Iron Shield could withstand only a few more hits before shattering, especially against a black flying sword that seemed anything but ordinary.  

**WHOOSH!**  

The enemy retracted his sword in an instant, then launched a second strike with terrifying precision. Qin Chong’s eyes widened—how could a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator manipulate artifacts with such terrifying skill?  

**BOOM!**  

This time, the attacker poured even more spiritual energy into the blow, slamming Qin Chong against a massive tree. Gritting his teeth, Qin Chong clung to the shield, though blood now trickled from his nose, his breathing ragged.  

"Impressive. Surviving two strikes makes you exceptional. The next one will shatter your shield—and your life."  

Qin Chong had no breath to waste on retorts. Words were meaningless now. His opponent was determined to kill him, and survival was his only concern.  

A crack had already formed at the center of the Black Iron Shield. The man was right—one more strike, regardless of its power, would destroy it.  

"Now, die!"  

The third attack came like lightning, too fast for Qin Chong’s eyes to follow. Yet he still strained to hold the shield in place.  

**CRACK!**  

With a deafening explosion, the Black Iron Shield shattered, fragments scattering in all directions.  

The black sword hesitated for only a fraction of a second before continuing its deadly trajectory.  

Seizing that brief moment, Qin Chong threw himself into a desperate roll, barely avoiding the strike. The sword pierced clean through a tree trunk thick enough to require two men to encircle.  

"Interesting. Let’s see how you dodge this one."  

The black streak lunged again.  

This time, a flash of green light erupted from Qin Chong’s body as a jade-hued flying sword shot forth, clashing directly against the black blade. A corona of opposing energies—black and green—collided in midair.  

But within moments, the green light began to falter.  

"You have a mid-grade artifact? No, this is—"  

Qin Chong had summoned Huo Yuanliang’s Aquaflame Sword. Though its water-aligned nature clashed with his own cultivation, reducing its effectiveness, it was still a mid-grade artifact—enough to buy him some time.  

Blood now dripped from the corner of Qin Chong’s mouth, his spiritual energy nearly depleted.  

"This is an outer disciple’s artifact from the Azure Dragon Valley. How do you have it? Are you one of theirs?"  

A flicker of doubt crossed the attacker’s eyes, but Qin Chong remained silent.  

"Fine. Then you die here." The man intensified his assault, forcing Qin Chong to retreat step by step just to maintain his defense.  

With no other options left, Qin Chong clenched his teeth and retrieved a mid-grade spirit stone from his pouch, gripping it tightly in his left hand to replenish his energy.  

"A mid-grade spirit stone? What a waste! Trying to outlast me? Let’s see how long you hold on!"  

The stone’s size made its quality unmistakable.  

As energy flooded back into his body, Qin Chong channeled it into the Aquaflame Sword, pushing back against the black blade. For a moment, the two weapons locked in a stalemate.  

After multiple exchanges, the gray-robed man’s energy had also dwindled, his expression growing tense. He produced a recovery pill and swallowed it hastily.  

But compared to a mid-grade spirit stone, Qi Refinement-level recovery pills were far less efficient, requiring time to refine through cultivation.  

Qin Chong’s gaze remained fixed on his opponent as he poured energy into the sword.  

After a tense standoff, Qin Chong suddenly surged forward, forcing the black sword back slightly. His opponent immediately braced for a counterattack.  

Yet in that instant—  

Qin Chong withdrew the Aquaflame Sword, leaped onto his own flying sword, and fled at full speed.  

He knew all too well that even with the spirit stone’s aid, victory was impossible. His only chance was escape.  

"Running? Let’s see how far you get!"  

Unhurried, the attacker mounted his black sword and gave chase in a streak of dark light.
