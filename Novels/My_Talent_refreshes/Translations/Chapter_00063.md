# Chapter 63: The Legacy of the Spirit Talisman Pavilion  

"I'm willing!"  

Chu Ning answered without hesitation. He had been worrying about where to learn talisman-making techniques, so joining the Spirit Talisman Pavilion was an opportunity he couldn't refuse.  

From Liao Yunming's earlier words, he had gleaned some insight. Those sent by the Spirit Plantation Division to learn talisman-making wouldn't receive the same treatment as the Pavilion's disciples. People like Xie Caitian would likely only learn basic talisman techniques at most.  

But according to Liao Yunming, as long as he joined the Spirit Talisman Pavilion, he could learn more advanced talisman-making methods. At the same time, he wouldn't have to leave the Spirit Plantation Division—his Green Wood Spring Technique could still be cultivated there. It was the best of both worlds.  

Seeing Chu Ning agree, He Changyou and Liao Yunming nodded.  

"Good, then we'll send a message to request permission together."  

With that, He Changyou took out a communication talisman, and the two of them spoke into it briefly before sending it off.  

After about the time it took to drink a cup of tea, a response talisman flew back.  

He Changyou caught it and listened, then said, "The sect has approved."  

Chu Ning's heart leapt with joy, and Liao Yunming also broke into a smile.  

"Excellent! The Spirit Talisman Pavilion has gained another promising disciple."  

Then, as if correcting himself, he added, "Or rather, the Spirit Talisman Pavilion and the Hundred Arts Hall have gained another promising disciple."  

He Changyou turned to Chu Ning.  

"Thank Elder Liao for his generosity."  

Chu Ning immediately clasped his hands toward both of them.  

"Many thanks to both Elders for this opportunity."  

Noticing that Chu Ning hadn't left him out, He Changyou's expression softened slightly.  

"Senior Brother Liao, I'll leave Chu Ning in your care. I'll take the other disciples back first."  

After speaking to Liao Yunming, He Changyou turned back to Chu Ning.  

"Come find me at the Spirit Plantation Division's training grounds once you're done here."  

"Yes!" Chu Ning bowed in acknowledgment.  

Liao Yunming smiled warmly and beckoned. "Follow me."  

He then led Chu Ning straight to the third floor of the pavilion.  

Not long after they left, Tan Zhang, the Spirit Talisman Pavilion disciple, returned to the main hall with the other nine disciples.  

He Changyou immediately led them out.  

Xie Caitian and the others exchanged glances, noticing Chu Ning's absence, their faces filled with confusion.  

Xie Caitian, seemingly familiar with He Changyou, couldn't help but ask,  

"Elder He, aren't we waiting for Chu Ning?"  

He Changyou shook his head.  

"No need. Chu Ning's talent in talisman-making is exceptional. He's been accepted as a dual-hall disciple and will be learning talisman techniques now."  

Hearing this, the other nine were stunned, their faces a mix of shock and envy.  

Having been in the sect much longer than Chu Ning, they understood what being a dual-hall disciple meant—first and foremost, it meant automatic promotion to an outer sect disciple.  

While they were astonished by Chu Ning's extraordinary talent, they couldn't help but feel intensely envious.  

Suddenly, the talisman techniques they had just received didn't seem quite as appealing anymore.  

---  

Meanwhile, Chu Ning followed Liao Yunming to the third floor, where they entered a spacious hall.  

Rows of shelves lined the room, each labeled with large characters:  

Talismans, Talisman Brushes, Talisman Ink, Manuals... everything was neatly organized.  

"This is the Spirit Talisman Pavilion's repository," Liao Yunming explained.  

"While these aren't the most precious items in the pavilion, they're all of excellent quality. Since I promised you the same treatment as our disciples, I'll select a few things for you."  

With that, he walked forward.  

Chu Ning watched eagerly, his eyes burning with anticipation.  

Each category was further divided into different shelves and layers, clearly indicating varying levels of quality.  

He wondered what Liao Yunming would choose for him.  

As he pondered, Liao Yunming first stopped at the talisman brush shelf and picked one out.  

Then he moved to the ink, manuals, and finally even the talisman shelf.  

After making his rounds, Liao Yunming returned to Chu Ning.  

"Though you have talent, you're still a beginner, so I haven't selected anything too advanced."  

He handed the items to Chu Ning one by one.  

"A mid-grade talisman brush. A good brush improves success rates. This is far better than the shoddy ones the Spirit Plantation Division hands out—those don't even qualify as low-grade."  

Liao Yunming's tone was dismissive.  

Chu Ning internally sighed—that "shoddy" brush hadn't even been given to him; he'd had to buy it with spirit stones.  

"Five boxes of standard talisman ink. The ink is mostly the same until you start making intermediate talismans."  

Liao Yunming continued, "Once you start completing tasks for the pavilion, you can collect a few boxes each month."  

Chu Ning accepted them, tucking the brush and ink into his storage pouch without examining them closely.  

Next, Liao Yunming handed him a jade slip.  

"This jade slip contains the Spirit Talisman Pavilion's foundational knowledge on primary talismans—basic talisman-making principles and techniques for crafting lower-grade primary talismans."  

His expression grew serious.  

"Don't underestimate this foundation. The other nine disciples today were only taught a few specific talisman techniques. This, however, systematically covers talisman-making and includes insights compiled by generations of our disciples.  

"If you want to master this art, you must start here."  

Chu Ning accepted it solemnly.  

"I will study it diligently."  

Pleased by his earnest response, Liao Yunming nodded approvingly.  

"Practice the basics well. Once you've mastered the knowledge inside and can craft five of the talismans with at least a sixty percent success rate, you can apply to learn the *Spirit Talisman Compendium*."  

"*Spirit Talisman Compendium*?" Chu Ning exclaimed in surprise.  

He had seen this before—back when Mu Ling had shown it to him, which was how he'd learned about the opportunity to study talisman-making.  

Liao Yunming smiled.  

"The *Spirit Talisman Compendium* is one of our pavilion's finest primary talisman manuals. It records techniques for crafting upper and mid-grade primary talismans—extremely valuable."  

Chu Ning's eyes gleamed with excitement.  

Seeing this, Liao Yunming's smile deepened.  

He gave this same motivational speech to every new disciple, and it always worked.  

However, very few managed to obtain the *Spirit Talisman Compendium* in a short time.  

For a new disciple, achieving a sixty percent success rate in five talisman techniques was no easy feat.  

Of course, Chu Ning didn't know this.  

His only thought upon hearing Liao Yunming's words was simple:  

The *Spirit Talisman Compendium*—he *would* claim it!
