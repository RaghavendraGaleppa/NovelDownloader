# Chapter 36: Flying Ants Annihilate the Enemy  

Qin Chong could clearly sense the tendrils of demonic energy eroding his Four Symbols Revolving Spear, causing his expression to darken with alarm.  

The spiritual energy of righteous cultivators and the demonic energy of devil cultivators inherently countered each other. The outcome of such confrontations usually depended on the cultivators' cultivation levels and techniques. Once a magical artifact was corroded by the opponent's energy, its power would be greatly diminished. If damaged, repairing it later would be even more troublesome.  

Seeing this, Qin Chong decisively withdrew the Four Symbols Revolving Spear and, gritting his teeth, hurled several Explosive Flame Talismans.  

**Boom! Boom! Boom!**  

After a series of deafening explosions, the encroaching demonic energy was completely dispersed. The Soul-Snatching Banner also seemed to have suffered damage, its aura weakening once more.  

"Good! Very good! To force me to this extent—you’ve earned the right to die by my hand!"  

The devil cultivator appeared somewhat disheveled, but the killing intent in his eyes burned fiercely. He channeled a surge of demonic energy into the Soul-Snatching Banner, preparing to launch another attack.  

However, Qin Chong flung out all his remaining talismans in one go. The ensuing explosion was more than twice as powerful as before.  

After the blast, the thick demonic energy that had shrouded the area was almost entirely swept away. What Qin Chong saw next filled him with even greater fury.  

The ground was littered with piles of bleached bones—not a single one of the hundred or so villagers had survived. The scene was horrifying.  

While Qin Chong could grudgingly accept the brutality of battles between cultivators, the senseless slaughter of so many innocent villagers was something he couldn’t stomach.  

**Cough! Cough!**  

The devil cultivator was still alive?  

The sound of coughing snapped Qin Chong out of his rage. His own spiritual energy was nearly depleted. If the enemy still had strength to counterattack, his situation would be dire.  

"Hahaha! My painstakingly refined Soul-Snatching Banner has been severely damaged because of you, you little bastard! A hundred deaths wouldn’t be enough to atone for your crime!"  

The tattered banner rose into the air once more, and dark clouds of demonic energy surged forth. The devil cultivator, now frenzied and heedless of his injuries, poured every last drop of his remaining energy into the banner.  

In an instant, the battered Soul-Snatching Banner erupted with terrifying power. Piercing wails and howls echoed from within the demonic energy as swarms of vengeful spirits rushed toward Qin Chong.  

With no other choice, Qin Chong summoned his Frostsilver Sword, sending it streaking through the air like a silver bolt.  

**Bang!**  

A deafening explosion erupted—Qin Chong had detonated the Frostsilver Sword!  

The blast was as powerful as seven or eight talismans combined. The demonic energy was obliterated, and the Soul-Snatching Banner split in two, crashing to the ground.  

Silence fell over the battlefield.  

**Guh!**  

Unable to suppress the surging blood in his chest, Qin Chong spat out a mouthful of blood—a backlash from the self-destruction of his artifact.  

"You bastard, you should be dead now!" Qin Chong muttered under his breath as he surveyed the scene.  

Yet when he probed with his spiritual sense, his expression darkened further. There was no trace of the devil cultivator within his detection range.  

He wasn’t dead—he had escaped.  

Had he mastered some kind of teleportation technique?  

Even the most basic teleportation techniques required at least Foundation Establishment cultivation to grasp, and they consumed an enormous amount of energy while covering only short distances.  

Teleportation techniques were life-saving measures used in dire situations, allowing cultivators to vanish from one spot and reappear elsewhere in an instant. Mastering such a technique was incredibly difficult, requiring a sliver of comprehension of spatial laws. Even among Foundation Establishment cultivators, few could achieve it.  

How could a mere ninth-level Qi Condensation devil cultivator possess such an ability?  

Qin Chong couldn’t make sense of it, but the evidence was undeniable.  

Just then, a streak of light shot toward him from the distance at terrifying speed.  

It was him!  

Qin Chong wanted to flee, but his spiritual energy was completely exhausted. Even if he had any left, he doubted he could outrun the devil cultivator’s speed.  

"Hahaha! Die, you little wretch! Let’s see what other tricks you have up your sleeve!"  

**Whoosh!**  

A black streak shot toward Qin Chong—a top-grade flying sword, dark as obsidian. However, with the devil cultivator’s energy nearly depleted and his left arm severely injured, the sword’s power was greatly diminished.  

Even so, the attack was enough to be fatal for Qin Chong in his current state.  

He immediately summoned his Ironhide Shield, pouring the last of his energy into it.  

**Clang!**  

The shield was sent flying backward from the impact, smashing into Qin Chong and sending him tumbling back over thirty feet.  

Only after spitting a mouthful of blood onto the shield did he barely manage to stabilize it.  

Qin Chong’s brows furrowed deeply, his eyes tinged with red.  

With a wave of his hand, a dark cloud surged forth like a tidal wave toward the devil cultivator—his Spirit-Devouring Flying Ants.  

"Ah! Spirit-Devouring Flying Ants!"  

The devil cultivator’s face twisted in horror. He abandoned his attack on Qin Chong, frantically waving his arms as demonic energy surged from his body, forming a black protective barrier around him.  

A faint green flame flickered on the barrier’s surface—an unknown type of fire.  

Qin Chong’s heart sank. The devil cultivator was far more experienced than he had anticipated—not only did he recognize the Spirit-Devouring Flying Ants, but he also knew to counter them with fire.  

Countless flying ants swarmed over the devil cultivator, encasing him like a giant cocoon.  

One by one, the ants burned in the green flames, raining down onto the ground like falling leaves. Within moments, a thick layer of ant corpses covered the earth.  

But the swarm was vast. With Qin Chong’s energy completely drained, his only hope now lay with the ants.  

After a few moments, the devil cultivator let out agonized screams—his energy was exhausted, and he could no longer sustain his barrier or the flames.  

The screams lasted only a few breaths before silence returned.  

Qin Chong collapsed to the ground, his face ashen, gasping for air.  

It was finally over.  

After recovering for a moment, he staggered to his feet, retrieved the devil cultivator’s storage pouch, and scanned the surroundings before slowly making his way out of the village.  

Desperate to recover his energy, Qin Chong returned to his previous hiding spot.  

Exhausted both spiritually and physically, his body felt unbearably heavy. With great effort, he dragged himself inside.
