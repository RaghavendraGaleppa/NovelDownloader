# Chapter 74: Unexpected News

Lin Shan carried his belongings and first went to the Artifact Forge to inquire about selling his magical artifacts.  

The shopkeeper took out a magnifying glass—which also seemed to be a "detection artifact"—and hunched over the counter, squinting through his aged eyes as he carefully examined the items.  

After about a quarter of an hour, the shopkeeper put away his heirloom tool. Looking at the two artifacts before him, he shook his head at Lin Shan.  

"This low-grade artifact, the refined iron sword, has two chipped edges, likely damaged by external force. At best, I can offer five spirit stones for it."  

"As for this insect-rearing tower, it's intact, but since it was used to house flying ants, the interior has been mostly gnawed and damaged. I can only offer seven spirit stones for it."  

Lin Shan couldn't help but frown upon hearing this. "Shopkeeper, these artifacts are fully functional right now—no different from any other low-grade artifacts. You're lowballing me too hard!"  

The shopkeeper stroked his thin mustache. "These artifacts may seem fine, but they're actually severely damaged. They'll be completely useless after a few more uses. Right now, you can still recover some value. Be content with what you're getting!"  

Lin Shan scoffed. He didn't buy this nonsense at all. Others might have been swayed, but Lin Shan had his cheat—the Enhancement Panel! If it hadn't flagged any hidden flaws in these artifacts, what was this shopkeeper blabbering about?  

Seeing the man spout nonsense, Lin Shan wasted no more words. He retrieved his artifacts and left.  

Crossing a street, he arrived at the Treasure Pavilion.  

The Treasure Pavilion also bought all sorts of items. Lin Shan presented the two artifacts again, and while the appraiser here seemed more reliable, the prices offered weren't much better—eight spirit stones for the sword and ten for the tower.  

Lin Shan pondered for a moment. The difference was still too far from his expectations.  

After all, a refined iron sword typically sold for twenty spirit stones, and the insect-rearing tower for thirty. Since both were still in good working condition, he might as well set up a stall and try selling them as second-hand artifacts.  

So he took back the two artifacts and instead pulled out the remains of the Soulwood Fish, staring intently at the appraiser.  

The moment the appraiser behind the counter saw the Soulwood Fish, his eyes lit up!  

He stole a glance at Lin Shan, only to find the young man staring straight at him.  

Clearing his throat awkwardly, the appraiser pulled out a needle-like artifact and began examining the remains. It seemed every appraiser had their own "tool of the trade." Watching him twist and turn the needle with practiced motions, he looked quite professional.  

"Hmm... seems to be the remains of some wooden fish artifact. I'll give you two spirit stones for it."  

The appraiser put on an expression that suggested Lin Shan was getting a great deal.  

Lin Shan sneered. "These are the remains of a high-grade artifact, the Soulwood Fish. My elder personally fought and destroyed it in battle against an envoy of the Black Lotus Sect before handing it to me!"  

Not only did Lin Shan reveal the artifact's origins, but he also subtly warned the appraiser that he had powerful backing.  

The appraiser's face flushed with embarrassment upon being exposed. *If you knew its origins, why didn't you say so earlier? This is just awkward!*  

He had no choice but to revise his offer. "Well, it is a high-grade artifact remnant, but it's too severely damaged—only half remains. Look at these edges... tsk tsk. How about... twenty spirit stones?"  

Lin Shan remained expressionless. "The material of this high-grade artifact is three-hundred-year-old soulwood. Just the raw material alone, as a third-tier spiritual resource, has a market value of no less than a hundred spirit stones!"  

The appraiser's face twisted with embarrassment again. *If you knew the material, why not mention it sooner? This is just painful!*  

He had to adjust his offer once more. "The amount of soulwood here isn't much, and the spiritual patterns seem to have been scattered by lightning... thirty spirit stones!"  

After a lengthy round of bargaining, the deal was finally settled at forty-five spirit stones. Exhausted, Lin Shan left the Treasure Pavilion.  

*These unscrupulous merchants are utterly shameless!*  

---  

Arriving at the market district, the foot traffic today seemed decent.  

Lin Shan picked a spot and set up his own stall. He placed the *Artifact Refining Notes* alongside the low-grade iron sword, pricing the pair at thirty spirit stones. The *Beast Taming Notes* and the insect-rearing tower were bundled together at forty spirit stones.  

After all, the *Artifact Refining Notes* and *Beast Taming Notes* were introductory textbooks for two of the Six Arts of Cultivation. In shops, they sold for twenty spirit stones each, while the refined iron sword and insect-rearing tower went for twenty and thirty spirit stones respectively. By bundling them, Lin Shan wasn't shortchanging any frugal rogue cultivators looking for second-hand goods.  

As noon approached, cultivators began setting up stalls on either side of Lin Shan.  

Coincidentally, the stall to his left belonged to the talisman seller who had once sold him the Bloodburn Talisman and Invisibility Talisman, while the stall to his right was run by the spell seller who had sold him the Whirlwind Technique. The two seemed to be friends, having just arrived arm-in-arm after who-knows-where, and with no better spots available, they settled on setting up beside Lin Shan.  

Now, these two "fake young masters" who secretly peddled goods behind their elders' backs flanked Lin Shan on both sides.  

"What a coincidence, gentlemen! I'm the one who—" Lin Shan introduced himself.  

The two nodded in sudden realization—whether they actually remembered him or were just pretending was unclear—and the three struck up a conversation.  

As they manned their stalls, idle chatter turned into tall tales as they boasted about their exploits.  

The talisman seller recounted how he had followed his clan elder to the Eastern Sea and encountered a mermaid princess.  

The spell seller shared his story of traveling to the Western Desert with his family elder and stumbling upon an ancient Buddhist cave.  

Lin Shan, in turn, narrated his tale of accompanying his sect senior to the Southern Border to exterminate an envoy of the demonic Black Lotus Sect.  

The three exchanged praises, growing more congenial by the minute. They even joked about slaughtering a chicken or cow to swear brotherhood on the spot.  

But when the topic shifted to the "Yichuan Auction," Lin Shan fell silent, listening intently to their boasting.  

The spell seller said, "Speaking of the Yichuan Auction, they hold small auctions yearly and grand auctions every five years. This year happens to be a grand one—there might be some real treasures up for grabs!"  

The talisman seller added, "Last year's small auction's finale item was a minor divine ability talisman crafted by my great-grandfather—the *Blazing Sky Incineration Talisman*!"  

The spell seller exclaimed, "Brother, your Murong Clan is truly formidable, with a Golden Core Realm expert presiding. How enviable!"  

The talisman seller waved it off modestly. "Not at all, not at all. Your family is no less impressive!"  

The spell seller then said, "I heard this year's auction will have Foundation Establishment Pills. Have you heard about that, brother?"  

The talisman seller nodded. "That's common knowledge among all major cultivation families now. Rumor has it that last time, ten Foundation Establishment Pills sold for a sky-high price of fifty thousand spirit stones—almost as much as a damaged magic treasure fragment!"  

The spell seller sighed. "Indeed. These days, spiritual herbs and flowers of sufficient age are becoming increasingly rare. The cultivation cycles of major sects and families can't keep up with consumption rates. The younger generation of low-to-mid-level cultivators is struggling—it's quite concerning."  

The talisman seller agreed. "Absolutely..."  

...  

Despite being mere Qi Refining cultivators, the two began discussing the grand affairs of the cultivation world, critiquing policies and lamenting the state of the realm.  

Lin Shan, sandwiched between them, pricked up his ears and gleaned much useful information. After all, he spent most of his time cultivating and had no local connections. Isolated from the world's happenings, he had no other way to learn such news.  

When he heard that the Yichuan grand auction in three days would require at least late-stage Qi Refining cultivation as the minimum entry threshold, he quietly calculated. *If I can break through before then, I might still make it.*  

What particularly caught his attention was their mention that the auction was currently accepting consignments—with the minimum requirement being mid-grade spiritual items. His heart stirred at this.  

He did indeed have two mid-grade items in his possession: the Frostiron Sword and the Purple Spirit Fruit seed.  

The Frostiron Sword was non-negotiable, but the Purple Spirit Fruit seed... perhaps it was worth a try?
