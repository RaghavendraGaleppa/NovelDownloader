# Chapter 43: Nether Soul Demonic Lotus

The basement was utterly silent, with only the sound of three people's breathing audible.

Qu Lian sat cross-legged, her eyes half-closed. A phantom image of a snow-white lotus hovered above her head, emitting strands of white light that enveloped her entire body. 

Under the illumination of the white light, despite her water-blue dress modestly covering her body, faint black threads could be seen faintly shimmering—like spider silk, countless strands wrapping around a certain spot inside her body, forming a cocoon-like mass. 

At first glance, the black threads seemed ordinary, but a slight spiritual sense scan revealed their chilling, sinister nature, evoking discomfort. Without a doubt, these were the Corpse Ghost Worms.

However, upon closer inspection, Wang Chan's expression turned grim. 

"The Corpse Ghost Worms have taken root in her heart!"

For most cultivators, the heart and brain were extremely vulnerable. The thought of inserting slender silver needles into her heart made Wang Chan's expression turn grave. The slightest misstep in controlling his spiritual energy could easily prove fatal.

"Brother Wang, please proceed with the needles without worry. I will be fine," Qu Lian said considerately, noticing his hesitation.

Touched by her trust, Wang Chan nodded solemnly. "Do you need any other protective measures?"

"The Corpse Ghost Worms reside there, so my heart won't be damaged. Even if injured, they will draw energy from other parts of my body to heal it," Qu Lian replied calmly, shaking her head.

As if to reassure him further, she suddenly retrieved a thin black needle from her storage pouch and, without hesitation, stabbed it into her own heart.

"Ah!" 

The needle pierced her heart, and Qu Lian let out a soft cry, her eyes squeezing shut in pain. Her face contorted slightly, and a trickle of blood seeped from the corner of her mouth. 

But at that moment, a dark mist surged around her heart, drawing energy from other parts of her body to mend the wound. In an instant, the needle was forced out.

Wang Chan and Ning Jingming exchanged glances. 

This woman... was she always this ruthless to herself?

After observing for a while and confirming she was unharmed, Wang Chan nodded, preparing to proceed. Still, he took a moment to carefully study the best approach for inserting the needles.

His gaze then drifted curiously to the white lotus phantom above Qu Lian's head. 

As a humble rogue cultivator with limited knowledge, he pondered for a long time but couldn't identify its origin.

"Brother Qu, is your symbiotic spirit the Nether Soul Demonic Lotus?" Ning Jingming suddenly asked, his tone laced with wariness.

Qu Lian didn't respond, but the slight twitch of her eyelids confirmed it.

Symbiotic spirit?

Wang Chan was momentarily stunned. Given Qu Lian's aura, he had assumed she was an orthodox cultivator, never expecting her to be from an unorthodox sect. 

This was his first time witnessing an unorthodox cultivator's symbiotic spirit up close.

A symbiotic spirit referred to the practice of unorthodox cultivators utilizing various spiritual entities—demons, ghosts, and other supernatural beings—to complement their cultivation methods. These spirits compensated for the inherent flaws in unorthodox techniques, aiding their practice.

If an unorthodox cultivator found a symbiotic spirit perfectly suited to them—and if the spirit itself was powerful—their cultivation would progress much faster, and the spirit could become a formidable ally in battle.

There were even rumors that half of an unorthodox cultivator's combat strength came from their symbiotic spirit.

Generally, most unorthodox cultivators kept their symbiotic spirits hidden from outsiders, as revealing them could expose weaknesses and make them vulnerable to counterattacks. 

Thus, unless absolutely necessary, unorthodox cultivators rarely used their symbiotic spirits in combat. 

Some even refined additional, lesser spirits as decoys to mislead others, though this was uncommon.

Of course, if the symbiotic spirit had little combat ability and was more supportive in nature, there was less need for secrecy—such as Beauty Mark's Autumn Wind Cicada.

Seeing Wang Chan's confusion, Ning Jingming explained, "No wonder Sister Qu can suppress the Corpse Ghost Worms. The Nether Soul Demonic Lotus can pacify the soul, bewitch the mind, and attack the spirit. Though only of mid-tier bloodline, it's an exceptionally rare spirit capable of targeting the soul."

Hearing this, Wang Chan subtly took two steps back.

No wonder Ning Jingming was so wary. That beautiful white lotus was actually a dangerous entity. 

It seemed he needed to strengthen his soul defenses when he had the chance. 

Otherwise, despite his formidable physical body, a weak soul could easily be exploited by others.

While his black needles, in their Profound Yin Qi form, could penetrate even the soul sea, they weren't necessarily capable of defending against soul attacks—especially since many such attacks were formless. 

The two were fundamentally different forces.

Unless something tangible entered the soul sea, there was little he could do to block them.

"Brother Wang, can you see clearly now?" Qu Lian suddenly opened her eyes and asked seriously.

Wang Chan had no choice but to step forward again, channeling spiritual energy into his eyes to scrutinize every detail.

"If Brother Wang still can't see clearly, I can remove the concealment from my body," Qu Lian offered without hesitation, as if worried he might miss something.

Such an opportunity?

Wang Chan's heart stirred, but Qu Lian's pure and natural aura left him without the slightest impure thought. 

This woman was truly strange—just one look from her put him in a state of utter clarity.

Still, he understood her reasoning. When lives were at stake, no precaution was excessive. What was a mere physical form compared to that?

"No need," Wang Chan refused with righteous dignity.

The Nether Soul Demonic Lotus was powerful enough to reveal the Corpse Ghost Worms clearly. There was no need to take advantage of the situation.

"Then let us begin," Qu Lian said with a deep breath.

"My needles may hurt. Please bear with it," Wang Chan warned.

"It's fine," Qu Lian replied with a faint smile, as if unconcerned.

Wang Chan nodded and retrieved nine silver needles from his storage pouch.

"Brother Wang, wait." Ning Jingming suddenly handed him a purple talisman. "Activate this protective charm first."

The talisman bore thunder-patterned inscriptions, resembling armor at a glance.

"A mid-grade Purple Thunder Armor Talisman? Brother Ning, you truly have remarkable means," Qu Lian remarked, impressed. "With this, even if the Corpse Ghost Worms explode, it can provide some defense and buy us time."

"Thank you, Brother Ning." Wang Chan hadn't expected this gesture and was genuinely moved.

Without hesitation, he affixed the talisman to his body. A crackling sound followed as a layer of purple thunder armor enveloped him, shielding him securely. 

Arcs of lightning flickered around him, humming softly.

With the talisman's power upon him, even the yin-tainted energy hidden within his True Bones seemed subdued. 

This thunder talisman was clearly extraordinary.
