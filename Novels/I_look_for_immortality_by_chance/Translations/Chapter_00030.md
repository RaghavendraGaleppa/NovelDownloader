# Chapter 30: Choosing Seals and the Auction  

"Forget it! Forget it!"  

"I can't just pursue secret seals blindly. Secret seals only represent lineage and spiritual perception—they don't mean other seals are worthless."  

Gu Yuan scrutinized the two seals for a long time before finally sighing and selecting the latter one.  

The *Mi Yuan Chi Arrow Seal* wasn't a secret seal, but its power was immense. Among all the seals Gu Yuan had seen, few could surpass it.  

And Gu Yuan needed a trump card.  

If he truly encountered a fight, he would need a decisive, thunderous method!  

Most importantly, this seal might work wonders alongside the *Cloud and Mist Heaven Seal*.  

"Buzz—"  

As Gu Yuan made his choice, the restriction on the jade slip vanished, and the jade token in his hand dimmed, losing all its luster.  

Not daring to delay, Gu Yuan eagerly picked up the jade slip and examined it carefully.  

But after just a moment, his smile froze.  

"Damn it, how is it this expensive?!"  

Gu Yuan couldn't help but curse inwardly.  

In this world of cultivation, seals required the aid of Dao patterns to be forged, and to refine Dao patterns, one needed to purchase spiritual materials.  

The two seals Gu Yuan had chosen demanded rare resources.  

The primary material for the *Cloud and Mist Heaven Seal* was a fragment of a 500-year-old *Bi Ao* turtle's shell. Though only a small piece was needed, it was still an exorbitant price for such an ancient creature.  

The *Mi Yuan Chi Arrow Seal* required a piece of "Mi Yuan Golden Stone." While not as rare, the auxiliary materials were numerous—over a hundred items listed, enough to make one's head spin.  

Clutching his storage pouch, Gu Yuan felt his heart bleeding.  

It was like seeing a perfect interior design rendering, only to be immediately deterred by the price.  

Compared to these precious spiritual materials, comprehending the Dao patterns of the seals seemed trivial.  

In truth, not all seals required such expensive materials. Some high-grade seals could be forged with simpler resources.  

Because what truly mattered for seals was the comprehension and refinement of "Dao patterns."  

Some Dao patterns could be found on a three-year-old spirit herb, like the *Grass Sword Seal*.  

But to comprehend such patterns and forge them into seals required extraordinary talent.  

This world was vast and boundless. Wealth, companions, methods, and resources were the four golden principles.  

Yet, if one possessed exceptional talent and insight, defying the heavens wasn't impossible.  

Though Gu Yuan lamented the heavy cost of these two seals, he also felt a sense of relief.  

Because... he wasn't a prodigy.  

If success depended solely on talent rather than resources, that would be worse news for him.  

But this realization didn't make him any happier. He could only curse inwardly once more:  

"Damn it!"  

---  

After memorizing the details of forging the seals, Gu Yuan stood up.  

The jade tower seemed to understand his intentions. A gentle beam of light enveloped him, and in the next moment, he was transported out of the Transmission Hall.  

Bathing in the golden morning sunlight outside, Gu Yuan exhaled deeply.  

With the seals in hand, his confidence had greatly increased. Now, all he needed was to follow the path of cultivation step by step.  

But before that, he needed funds to continue his journey.  

"I hope the *Azure Crane Spirit Water* doesn't disappoint me..."  

Straightening his robes, Gu Yuan mounted his *Cloud-Treading Shuttle* and flew toward Silvermoon Bay.  

A month had passed. According to the agreement, if Gu Yuan didn't return the spirit stones by today, the *Azure Crane Spirit Water* would be auctioned off.  

Since Gu Yuan had already successfully refined the *Spirit Dragon Heavenly Water*, he no longer needed the *Azure Crane Spirit Water* and could use it to exchange for resources.  

This auction was crucial for his future cultivation, and he eagerly hoped for a few gullible bidders to appear.  

During his flight, he suddenly thought of Lan Tianlu.  

Had that guy already consumed the spirit water?  

---  

Silvermoon Bay's market was bustling with activity.  

Even the *Stellar Veil Auction*, which required a five-spirit-stone entry fee, was packed with shadowy figures under the moonlight.  

Inside the grand celestial hall, everyone gazed expectantly at the jade platform at the highest point.  

On the platform, a figure with an indistinct face held a small jade hammer, smiling as he surveyed the crowd below.  

"Thanks to everyone's support, the *Stellar Veil Auction* grows ever more prosperous, with treasures increasing by the day. Coinciding with Elder Xuan's emergence from seclusion, he has generously contributed a batch of rare items. Thus, I have organized this auction for all fellow disciples to bid!"  

After a brief introduction, the auctioneer waved his hand, and another veiled figure gracefully approached, presenting a magical artifact.  

"High-grade artifact—*Soul-Chiseling Hammer*!"  

"A single strike from this hammer will stun the spiritual sense of any enemy below the eighth level of Qi Refining, leaving their sea of consciousness in turmoil and rendering them immobile. A treasure for decisive victory! Those who have consumed high-grade or better spirit water may have slight resistance, but it won't diminish this artifact's power. Starting bid—fifty spirit stones!"  

The auctioneer's voice rang out loudly.  

"Fifty-one!"  

"Fifty-three!"  

"Sixty!"  

The crowd erupted with bids, and the atmosphere quickly grew heated.  

Meanwhile, a familiar voice whispered in Gu Yuan's ear:  

"Senior Brother, please don't take offense."  

"The *Stellar Veil Auction* was founded by Elder Xuan. As the elder of the *Celestial Artifice Pavilion*, many of his disciples are skilled artificers. To support their business, the auction occasionally features magical artifacts for sale."  

"We originally planned to auction our items separately, but we happened to coincide with the *Celestial Artifice Pavilion*'s event. So we decided to combine them—perhaps we can fetch a higher price this way."  

"Since the *Celestial Artifice Pavilion* took over the auction, there are no commissions. They're essentially promoting our items for free. Please don't mind, Senior Brother."  

The figure who had guided Gu Yuan into the celestial hall earlier explained with a smile.  

"Brother Si is considerate. How could I possibly mind?"  

Gu Yuan replied with a smile.  

"Si" and "Yang" were naturally their pseudonyms for the occasion.  

"I'm glad you're not upset. The *Celestial Artifice Pavilion* has many good items today, along with treasures from other sources. If anything catches your eye, feel free to bid."  

"From what I know, at least six or seven scions of noble families have come specifically for the *Azure Crane Spirit Water*. It's bound to fetch a high price—Senior Brother stands to make a hefty profit!"  

Brother Si flattered him with a grin.  

The *Azure Crane Spirit Water* was among the finest of high-grade spirit waters, surpassing even the *Silver Fish Spirit Water* of the Dao Academy. Any noble disciple with means would surely compete fiercely for it, securing a brighter future for their descendants.  

Hearing this, Gu Yuan felt much more at ease and quietly observed the auction.  

The auction was lively, with artifacts and seals of remarkable quality. But for Gu Yuan, who had just returned from the Transmission Hall, they paled in comparison.  

Only a few spiritual materials caught his eye. He bid several times, spending thirty-five spirit stones to acquire key auxiliary materials for the *Mi Yuan Chi Arrow Seal*.  

The auction proceeded without much excitement until the main event arrived.  

"Today's auction features two treasures that I'm sure many of you have been eagerly awaiting!"  

"Without further ado—the *Azure Crane Spirit Water*, a high-grade spirit water for spiritual perception! Starting bid—two hundred spirit stones!"  

With a strike of the jade hammer, the crowd erupted.  

"Two hundred and ten!"  

"Two hundred and twenty!"  

"Two hundred and forty!"  

The clamor of bids made Gu Yuan's lips curl into an uncontrollable grin.  

But among the crowd, one figure stared at the spirit water on the platform, his heart filled with bitterness and resentment.  

"Gu Yuan!"  

"That's my spirit water!"  

"Mine!"  

"White Worm Frost Prison... I've gained a new opportunity this time. I swear, I will make you pay!"  

Even as he seethed with hatred, he obediently raised his hand and called out:  

"Two hundred and fifty spirit stones!"
