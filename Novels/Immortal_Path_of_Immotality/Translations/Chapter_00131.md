# Chapter 130: The True One's Passing

In the dimly lit cave dwelling, Lin Shan hastily arranged various ritual items. Placing the Tail Devouring Worm's severed tail before the straw effigy, he had no time to care about aesthetics—time was of the essence.

Drawing his bow and nocking an arrow aimed at the straw figure, his consciousness instantly shifted to the mysterious aperture within his dantian.

Inside, the lightning-scorched Tail Devouring Worm, its body blackened and charred, was pitifully licking its wounds with its tiny tongue when sudden terror struck.

"Hiss—!"

The worm convulsed violently, emitting shrill screams as if unaware of what was happening. Segmented sections of its body began sprouting soft black tentacles, while its once-lively eyes gradually transformed into the grid-like compound eyes of an insect.

Lin Shan, who suffered from trypophobia, felt goosebumps erupt all over his body at the sight.

The worm's originally plump form began taking on defined contours, with pronounced muscle ridges and branching veins spreading like tree roots. In the blink of an eye, the once-adorable creature had transformed into a hulking monstrosity!

"Is this a curse? It feels more like evolution!"

Observing the thick, writhing length before him, Lin Shan couldn't help but compare it to his own, sighing in relief that he still held the upper hand.

Regardless, he couldn't allow this transformation to continue. Releasing the bowstring, the arrow struck the straw effigy.

"Chirp—!"

The Tail Devouring Worm inside him wailed again, rolling and trembling as countless tentacles sprouted from its body, probing the surroundings as if sensing something.

Lin Shan marveled at the sight—he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator! Cursing a mere Qi Refining creature should have killed it instantly. Yet this gu worm persisted. Just what had Turtle True One created?

Despite his astonishment, Lin Shan nocked a second arrow.

The worm's condition worsened. Its seemingly evolving exoskeleton softened, and its thick, rigid body appeared corroded from within, gradually shrinking again.

After another comparative glance, Lin Shan confidently drew his bow a third time.

Finally, a wobbly matchstick-like figure emerged from the mysterious aperture, resembling a dying man in the desert desperately seeking water. The Tail Devouring Worm, unable to resist, crawled out in search of its master, yearning to return to its warm embrace.

Overjoyed to see this stubborn squatter finally vacate his aperture, Lin Shan swiftly enveloped it with spiritual energy. Weakened by the curses, the worm offered no resistance.

"Splat!"

With a single step, Lin Shan crushed the defenseless creature beneath his foot.

---

"HAHAHAHA!"

"Still acting tough now?"

"These past few days have been torture—DIE!"

Unable to resist, Lin Shan stomped several more times. Only when he sensed no life beneath his feet and his aperture felt empty again did he burst into relieved laughter.

Meanwhile, in another cave dwelling unknown to him, a frail old man suddenly coughed up blood.

"Master! What's wrong?"

The Foundation Establishment youth paled at the sight. He knew how severe Turtle True One's injuries were and how critical his condition had become.

A Golden Core cultivator's lifespan typically spanned four hundred years. Though Turtle True One had extended his life past this limit through extraordinary techniques, hoping to break through to Nascent Soul and rejuvenate himself, the past three years of constant battles and escapes after the demonic sects' ambush on Fishing Turtle Island had left him no opportunity to attempt the breakthrough.

Now, with his vitality nearly exhausted, he had consumed his last precious healing pill in a final gamble.

In the cultivation world, pills were categorized by grade. While ordinary Jade Pills for Qi Refining cultivators held little marvel, higher grades like Dharma Pills, Treasure Pills, and Spirit Pills offered progressively greater effects.

Treasure Pills, equivalent to Golden Core cultivators' magic treasures, possessed transformative properties. Many minor supernatural abilities required specific Treasure Pills for cultivation. Healing Treasure Pills were especially rare—only a renowned figure like Turtle True One could acquire them.

As for the even rarer Spirit Pills, legends spoke of them developing sentience akin to spiritual treasures.

The youth didn't understand why his master, while refining the Treasure Pill, had suddenly vomited blood—a clear sign of qi deviation.

"Enough... enough."

"Heaven's will..."

Turtle True One coughed more blood, his face instantly ashen like a mountain ghost, his sunken eyes and bark-like skin radiating despair as he sighed endlessly.

As his life force began fading, memories of his youth flashed before his eyes...

During healing, disturbances were strictly forbidden. The death of his life-bound gu worm triggered an instant backlash against his soul and vitality.

At his peak, he might have suppressed it. But now, exhausted and at death's door, qi deviation left him beyond saving.

Tears streaming down his face, the youth collapsed at his master's feet, wailing. Turtle True One extended a skeletal hand, gently stroking the youth's hair with weary affection.

"My foolish, foolish disciple..."

"I always knew you coveted my legacy."

"Your senior brothers and sisters scattered long ago. Few remained by my side these three years."

"Some died, some fled, some betrayed, some surrendered. Only you stayed faithfully by my side."

"Your perseverance reminds me of my younger self. Had this demonic calamity not struck the East Sea..."

"Perhaps..."

Turtle True One's murmurs faded into silence.

Thus passed the East Sea's mighty titan, cultivator of the Darkwater Cold Turtle manifestation, a step away from Nascent Soul—quietly dying on an obscure border island.

The youth, now composed, gently closed his master's eyes, even smiling with relief.

"You old bastard, you really held on stubbornly."

"Do you know how much suffering I've endured these three years, chasing and fleeing with you?"

"Now it's all worth it. All our sect siblings are dead. You're dead. Only I remain—HAHAHA!"

"Even after expenditures during our flight, the wealth you accumulated over a century on Fishing Turtle Island is enough to propel me to Golden Core!"

"Once I cross the East Sea into the vast outer oceans, a hundred years of secluded cultivation will make me a Golden Core True One."

"By then, the righteous-demonic war will have ended, the world settled. As a rogue cultivator, I can start anew!"

"HAHAHA—"

The youth's initial venting of grievances transitioned into triumphant laughter, reveling in his hard-won success.

But in the next instant, his joy turned to horror.

His laughter choked off like a strangled duck's quack. With terrified eyes, he watched black spots erupt across his body, burning strangely as they corroded his spiritual energy—the more he resisted, the faster the corrosion spread.

Before he could react, all his hair—scalp, eyebrows, beard, underarms, chest, belly, even his nether regions—shed completely, achieving a macabre version of "purification."

Worse yet, a white, hairless skull sprouted from his right shoulder. Turning his head, he found its hollow eye sockets staring blankly at him, jaws clacking in eerie laughter.

---

On the opposite side of the same island, Lin Shan grinned excitedly as he drew his bow toward the straw effigy. Before it lay the bottle of white mist given by the Foundation Establishment youth, illuminated by two flickering candles.

"The hour of Zi has passed—a new day brings three fresh curses. Might as well use them!"
