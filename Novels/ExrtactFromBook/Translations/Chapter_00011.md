# Chapter 11: Exhilaration

Four large wagons raced through the forest, the draft horses displaying endurance that left Han Yue utterly astonished. 

They could actually cover two thousand kilometers in a single day and night! 

With these wagons, hunters from the Meat Division could comfortably hunt within a ten-thousand-kilometer radius. 

On the second day of their journey through the jungle, the convoy arrived at a location three thousand kilometers southwest of the Meat Division. 

This was the hunting ground allocated to the Celestial Sector. 

Upon arrival, the four wagons dispersed, each heading toward its own destination. 

After traveling another three hundred kilometers, they finally stopped by a large lake. 

The crew automatically set up tents and prepared meals, leaving only Fang Yi and Han Yue to chat. 

"Han Yue, after this hunt, you should go pick out some armor from the warehouse at the Division," Fang Yi suggested. 

"In this forest, anything can happen—hidden dangers lurk everywhere. An extra layer of protection is always good." 

Fang Yi's hunting experience far surpassed that of most people, and Han Yue wholeheartedly agreed with her advice. 

He had already decided that his next choice would be a resource-type or cultivation-enhancing divine ability. 

To improve his defenses, he would have to rely more on external aids. 

"This forest is teeming with demonic beasts that have claimed countless cultivators' lives," Fang Yi continued. 

"My grandfather and Xiao Liu's father died last year during a hunt when they unexpectedly encountered a second-order demonic beast. They sacrificed themselves to protect our retreat." 

"But this is the fate of us cultivators from the Meat Division!" 

"Our Division controls so many resources that countless rogue cultivators strive to join the numbered workshops." 

"Everyone fights desperately for cultivation. Whatever the consequences, we must accept them." 

Han Yue hadn't expected Fang Yi to be so philosophical. She spoke of her loved ones' deaths with remarkable calmness. 

"Division Head, why is the Meat Division able to occupy this forest and herd demonic beasts here? Aren't there other forces competing for it?" Han Yue asked. 

"This place is both a hunting ground and a prison. If our Meat Division didn't guard the borders and suppress the demonic beasts, humanity's living space would gradually be encroached upon." 

"These resources are merely our compensation." 

"How many disciples from major sects would be willing to spend their entire lives trapped here, hunting demonic beasts and cultivating bloodline power?" 

"Our Meat Division has existed for over a thousand years, producing millions of cultivators—certainly the highest number in the world! Yet we've barely managed to cultivate a handful of third-order cultivators." 

"Han Yue, if possible, I'd also like to leave the Meat Division and venture inland, to experience life as a disciple of a prestigious sect." 

This piqued Han Yue's interest. "Division Head, do you know about the inland regions?" 

"I've never left the Meat Division. I only know that east of the Spirit Sword Gorge lies human territory." 

"The further east you go, the denser the population and the more cultivation factions there are." 

"According to human cultivation hierarchies, factions that have produced fourth-order grand cultivators can be called 'prestigious schools.' Those with fifth-order grand cultivators qualify as 'major sects.'" 

"Places like our Meat Division, which have produced several third-order cultivators, are merely influential local factions." 

"About a hundred thousand kilometers east is the region of Guizhou, under the influence of the 'Beast Taming Sect,' a prestigious school." 

"The 'Beast Taming Sect' has fourth-order grand cultivators and is the closest major sect to us. They specialize in taming demonic beasts and cultivating bloodline power, making them the most compatible with our Meat Division." 

"Historically, many have left the Meat Division to join the 'Beast Taming Sect,' but prestigious sects have high thresholds—few succeed." 

"Once you leave the Meat Division and fail to join the 'Beast Taming Sect,' returning becomes nearly impossible." 

It made sense. Those who embarked on the cultivation path were no fools. How many would risk losing substantial resources for a slim chance to join a prestigious sect? 

"Han Yue, if you're interested in this information, you should visit the Trading House." 

"All these details are available for purchase on the fifth floor. After this hunt, you can use some trading coins to buy them." 

Before they could finish their conversation, the scouts returned with crucial news: 

"Division Head, Brother Dao, we've located the target—three kilometers north." 

Without hesitation, Fang Yi grabbed her long scythe and large shield, gathered her team, and set off. 

Only then did Han Yue receive Fang Yi's hunting dossier: 

**[Steel Ghost Ox]**  
**[Rank: First-Order]**  
**[Skill: Ghost Flame]**  
**[Length: Approximately 20 zhang (60 meters)]**  
**[Description: The Steel Ghost Ox absorbs aberrant energy, tempering its body into steel-like bones. Only second-order primordial energy can breach its defenses. Beware its Ghost Flame skill—physical contact is fatal. Recommended to attack its nostrils, perineum, or anus with sharp weapons.]**  

Another Steel Ghost Ox! 

Noticing Han Yue's surprise, Fang Yi explained, 

"Han Yue, among first-order demonic beasts, the Steel Ghost Ox has the most delicious and sought-after meat. Its horns, bones, and hide also fetch high prices, making it one of the most cost-effective prey." 

"Even after distributing the meat, the remaining parts of a Steel Ghost Ox can sell for 200 trading coins." 

"I never let one escape if I can help it!" 

As they spoke, the group crested a small hill and spotted the Steel Ghost Ox. 

At about five hundred meters, the ox sensed their presence through energy fluctuations. 

It assumed an aggressive stance, roaring at the intruders with black sparks flickering in its mouth. 

In the next instant, Fang Yi shot forward like a thunderbolt, leaving only an afterimage behind. 

Her movement generated tremendous kinetic energy, her armor screeching against the air with explosive friction! 

She closed the distance instantly, leaping high and slamming her shield directly onto the ox's snout. 

**BANG!** 

A deafening impact echoed as blood sprayed from the ox's nostrils, scattering the sparks in its mouth. 

Before the beast could react, Fang Yi landed, immediately springing up again to deliver another crushing shield bash. 

**BANG!**  
**BANG!**  
**BANG!**  

Each strike, infused with her bloodline power, sent violent tremors through the ox's body, leaving it stunned and rigid. 

Then, Fang Yi circled to its side, hefting her nearly two-meter-long bone scythe, and slashed it across the ox's neck. 

Empowered by her strength, the entire blade sank into the ox's flesh, cleaving a massive gash through its artery. 

With an eruption of bloodline energy, Fang Yi severed the ox's neck, inflicting a fatal wound. 

Blood gushed forth, drenching her completely. 

Releasing the scythe, she let the blood rain down as she moved to the ox's head and delivered a few more shield strikes for good measure before turning away. 

The hunt was over—completed in under fifteen seconds! 

Han Yue stood rooted in place, watching the entire spectacle, feeling nothing but exhilaration! 

Fang Yi's raw, overpowering combat style left his chest swelling with excitement!
