Chapter 109: Drinking Golden Crow Blood, My Kidneys Feel Warm

"Ice Cube, is there something stuck on my face?"

"No."

At the dining table, Li Mo looked at the girl opposite him, who resembled an ice lotus, feeling a bit confused.

The Ice Cube's peripheral gaze had been drifting over to him intermittently, seemingly lost in thought.

But the moment he looked over, she would immediately snap back to reality, as if nothing had happened.

"Then why...?"

"It's nothing. The food you made today is very delicious," Ying Bing said softly.

With money in his pocket, Student Li Mo had indeed put a lot of effort into his meals.

For instance, today's dish was made from a Grade 4 Beast, the Four-Winged Snake. The snake soup boiled from it was incredibly delicious and could nourish yin and supplement yang.

But...

"?"

Li Mo glanced at her clean bowl and chopsticks, slowly drawing a question mark in his mind.

"I was thinking about cultivation matters," Ying Bing shook her head and took a sip from her bowl.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in Ying Bing with a bowl of Four-Winged Snake Soup.】

【Investment Feedback: One Earth-Replenishing Body-Forging Pill (Six Patterns).】

【Earth-Replenishing Body-Forging Pill】: "Can regrow severed limbs and repair bodily deficiencies."

For Li Mo, this wasn't very precious.

But this type of pill, he was getting it for the first time.

Some people with physical deficiencies would definitely want it, like eunuchs.

Its value is definitely far beyond that of a Grade 4 Beast.

...

Nightfall.

Ying Bing returned to her former room.

The originally damaged bed had long since been cleared away.

In the empty space, she had placed a Cold Marrow Jade Bed.

The Cold Marrow Jade Bed has the effect of calming the mind and can withstand the cold Taiyin Qi. She didn't need to worry about cultivation damaging the surrounding furnishings anymore.

"It's almost identical to the one I had in my previous life."

Ying Bing took off her shoes and socks, shaking the water droplets from her hands.

In a daze, it seemed as if she had returned to the days when she sat atop the Laurels Palace, accompanied by the cold moon all year round.

High and lofty, yet lonely and cold.

At this moment, she was nothing like the person who had quietly washed dishes in the kitchen just moments ago.

*Whoosh—*

Taiyin Qi surged but was tightly confined within the range of the Cold Marrow Jade Bed, becoming even more condensed.

She entered a cultivation state.

Time passed.

Now, her Dantian was already filled to two-tenths of its capacity.

After the midnight hour, once the Taiyin Qi had calmed, she did not rest.

The True Phoenix Feather hung silently before her, a speck of rosy light blooming from her brow.

A drop of Emperor's Flowing Essence was dripped onto the feather.

She was about to truly begin refining the Rosy Phoenix Qi.

As a divine technique, the most powerful aspect of the Rosy Phoenix Qi lies in its never-ending nature.

...

On the other side.

In front of the waterfall not far from the Autumn Water Pavilion.

"It's the same as before."

Li Mo had arrived at the place where he often practiced.

The rock 'bathtub' he had carved out was filled with rainwater, and two birds were inside washing their feathers, appearing extremely spirited. They weren't afraid of him upon seeing him.

Li Mo didn't drive the two little birds away and sat cross-legged on the green stone.

He closed his eyes and sensed slightly.

After entering the Jade Liquid Realm with the "Karma Fire Red Lotus Wondrous Method," he became increasingly clear about the flow and changes of his internal Qi.

At this moment, he could feel the small lotus seed in his Dantian constantly inhaling and exhaling the liquid internal Qi.

During this process, the vitality of the lotus seed became increasingly abundant, and it had already sprouted.

"When the lotus seed grows a stem, condenses nine leaves, and produces a lotus seed, I will have formed a Xuan Dan," Li Mo recalled the insights from the Wondrous Method.

He took out the bottle of Golden Crow Blood and measured out a drop.

The Golden Crow is a legendary creature, far beyond the description of a 'Beast.'

Although it wasn't essence blood, even just its blood required extreme caution.

Li Mo didn't think the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body could make him invincible.

Even if it reached the Transformation Realm, he probably couldn't rely solely on his physique to take a punch from his Master.

His Master is obviously not as powerful as the Golden Crow.

"Fortunately, the Golden Crow Blood isn't as violent as I imagined, only a trace of its aura has leaked out..."

Li Mo thought for a moment.

He poured a cup of Verdant Wood Life-Bringing Liquid before dripping the crystal-clear Golden Crow Blood into it.

After dissolving, the liquid in the cup looked like a pale green gold.

"Here goes nothing!"

Li Mo took a breath and swallowed it head-on.

A thread of fire entered his stomach.

"Exhale..."

"Inhale..."

---

He adjusted his breathing, controlling the growth of the lotus seed while also making it constantly condense internal Qi...

Intense vitality.

Extreme Yang energy.

The two flowed and entangled within his body, making him feel as if he were a hot iron.

He stood up and charged into the waterfall.

*Thud—*

The Forging Calamity Meteor Hammer fell into his palm.

Countless weapon-slaying sharp auras gushed out, but were controlled by him, the weapon master, swirling around his body like swimming fish.

Sounds like leaves rustling in a forest occasionally came forth.

This weapon-slaying sharp aura could obliterate even fine weapons; an ordinary Internal Qi Realm cultivator would be annihilated in an instant.

However, light still shone from Li Mo's body.

His five viscera and six bowels all produced thunder-like rumbles.

This Golden Crow Blood actually had the effect of tempering the physique!

This was something Student Li Mo was ignorant of.

When master craftsmen forge famous weapons, they often use the blood of a type of Clanging Gold Bird to temper the weapon's edge.

His Qi and blood and internal Qi flowed faster and faster.

Li Mo only felt his entire body swelling, as if a volcano were erupting.

*Buzz—*

The Forging Calamity Meteor Hammer sensed its master's need and released an even more powerful weapon-slaying sharp aura.

*Swish, swish, swish—*

Stone powder rustled down.

Shaken away by Li Mo's body tremble.

"I've taken another step closer to having a body like a famous weapon," Li Mo exhaled.

In his Dantian.

Internal Qi was like jade liquid.

Above it, a flower bud floated, about to bloom.

"By the way."

"Why is it so warm here?"

Li Mo covered his kidneys.

Could it be that Golden Crow Blood...

Also has the effect of strengthening yang?

No wonder the Golden Crow race perished... is it possible that too many people wanted their blood?

Student Li Mo stopped his baseless associations.

He was a bit hot-headed right now.

That drop of Golden Crow Blood hadn't been completely consumed; the remainder was hidden in his kidneys.

"I'm afraid I haven't even used up a tenth of the Golden Crow Blood."

"The Verdant Wood Life-Bringing Liquid isn't enough for now," Li Mo sighed lightly.

Although he had many good things on him, they were all mixed up.

He really didn't have anything similar anymore.

"I'll go to the Scripture Pavilion first tomorrow, then find Elder Xue at the Dan Ding Peak."

Student Li Mo made his decision.

Hmm.

Dan Ding Peak is the wealthiest among the Nine Peaks and also has the most rare treasures.

Old Xue might have some good stuff in his hands.

Moreover, condensing a Xuan Dan is, to some extent, similar to refining pills.

...

The next day.

Scripture Pavilion.

"I want to go to the sixth floor."

The counter was tapped.

The deacon who was lowering his head recording suddenly looked up, but found no one in front of him.

"Have I been reading too many illustrated books lately?"

"Am I hallucinating?"

The deacon scratched his head and lowered his head to check the books again.

"Are you deaf?"

The voice came again.

"Look down!"

The deacon was stunned.

Only then did he see a child about the height of the counter, wearing the clothes of a true disciple, looking at him with an unhappy expression.

"So it's Junior Brother Bao."

"My apologies, my apologies."

The deacon quickly apologized.

This was the beloved disciple of Elder Xue from Dan Ding Peak.

"Never mind, help me record it, I want to go to the sixth floor."

After recording, the child staggered his way to the sixth floor.

The two deacons behind him watched his retreating figure and couldn't help but sigh.

"If Junior Brother Bao didn't have a physical deficiency, he should be in the Divine Manifestation Realm by now, right?"

"Yeah, it's a pity that even Elder Xue can't cure this illness."

"He's been to the sixth floor many times; he should be looking for a way."

As the two were speaking, they heard footsteps at the entrance again.

Upon seeing the person, the two quickly straightened their clothes and became respectful:

"Senior Brother Li."
