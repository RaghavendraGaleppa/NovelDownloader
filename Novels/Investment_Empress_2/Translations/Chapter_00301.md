# Chapter 301: How to Date?

“With a steel straight guy like Young Master Zhong, you can’t confront him head-on. You have to tease him.”

“Tease?”

“Ah, your movement is a bit too exaggerated. I’m not talking about physical actions. Haven’t you heard that a woman who acts spoiled has the best fate?”

At the very least, having seen a thing or two from his past life, Student Li was an expert when it came to giving pointers.

Zhong Ling was completely fooled, almost calling him Master Li. She thought to herself, *as expected of a genius from the Hidden Dragon List. Having traveled thousands of miles, he really knows a lot.*

Haven’t you seen the way Fairy Han looks at him?

Even a celestial beauty like her can’t part from him, so he must have some authority on the matter.

“If you really don’t get it, just flip through this.”

“Isn’t this just a storybook?”

“The recent updates include a plotline about a demonic maiden from the Joyful Union Sect. I have to say, it’s got some substance. I suspect Senior Brother Ouyang conducted some on-site research.”

“???”

...

Half an hour later, all sorts of skewers were laid out on the table.

The tavern was bustling again. Since dinner time had passed, it was now the late-night snack hour. Jiawei Tavern was lively once more, with street-side barbecue stalls characteristic of the Southern Frontier puffing out clouds of white smoke.

Li Mo brought out the skewers and sauces.

This place was originally opened by a retired squad leader. On days off, many familiar faces from the barracks came by, quite a few bringing their families. The atmosphere had the distinct vibe of a veterans’ barbecue.

“Young Master Zhong, you’re eating here too?”

“Did you come alone? If you don’t mind, join our table?”

“Tiger, call him Big Brother Zhong.”

“Hello, Big Brother Zhong.”

“?”

Before Zhong Zhenyue could take a bite, he suddenly didn’t feel so hungry anymore, and he felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles.

To be honest, he was envious. But remembering his experience in Yunzhou, he couldn’t help but shudder.

“Where’s Ling’er?” Zhong Zhenyue asked casually.

Li Mo put the skewers on the grill and smiled mysteriously. “She said she needed to ask the landlady for help to change her clothes.”

“Change clothes?”

Zhong Zhenyue was stunned.

Just as they said a few words, the door to the owner’s room suddenly opened. Zhong Ling, adorned with silver ornaments and wearing Southern Frontier attire that was relatively revealing by Central Plains standards, walked out gracefully.

It had to be said, she had a unique charm.

*Tsk, I wonder what Ice Cube would look like in that outfit?*

*Ice Cube’s waist isn’t a waist, it’s...*

Li Mo turned his head, smiling as he prepared to watch Zhong Zhenyue’s reaction.

“You demonic woman! How dare you come to the Southern Frontier to harm me again!”

Zhong Zhenyue’s face was full of vigilance. He sprang up like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, using a lamb skewer as a shield.

Li Mo: “...”

Talk about being bitten by a snake once and fearing a rope for the rest of one’s life.

However, this situation was within Student Li’s expectations! (Foreseen by the Eye of Fate), and he had already warned Zhong Ling about it.

“You ate your own... when you were four...”

“Sis, please don’t say it...”

Zhong Zhenyue finally behaved. Zhong Ling twitched the corner of her mouth and sat down beside him. She glanced at Student Li, who was calmly grilling skewers, and suddenly felt her courage bolstered, putting on a smile.

“Don’t call me ‘Sis’ today, it makes me sound so old.”

“Here, have a skewer~”

“Little flying stick is coming~”

Zhong Zhenyue was sweating profusely and swallowing hard, his eyes screaming to Li Mo: *‘Save me.’*

Unfortunately, Little Li Chef was obscured by the smoke and didn’t see it.

Not long after, the entire tavern fell silent for a moment as Ice Cube walked out of the room gracefully and sat down beside Li Mo, resting her chin in her hand as she watched him grill.

She glanced at the two people not far away, her gaze somewhat strange.

“What’s wrong with them?”

“They are probably, roughly, possibly... dating?”

“?”

Ying Bing was about to fix her cool gaze on the skewers, but it paused unconsciously on Zhong Zhenyue and Zhong Ling. The smoke rising from the grill seemed to add a touch of ethereal aura to her. How unbelievable.

She was momentarily lost in thought.

Dating...?

In her previous life, her days were filled with crises and intricate plots. She disliked scheming against others, so she quietly locked herself in the Osmanthus Palace.

---

Besides occasionally feeling the cold loneliness, she had actually grown accustomed to it.

Until she was reborn. At first, it was the daily meals, then practicing martial arts together, sleeping in the same bed, soaking in the same pool, and even giving her massages...

Ying Bing felt a bit dazed. How had she done all these things she once couldn’t imagine?

Does this... count as dating?

How exactly is dating supposed to be done?

It couldn’t possibly be like what he has in mind...

Ying Bing felt she needed to consult some references.

Hmm... just to understand it a bit. She couldn’t be completely ignorant of this aspect and just let him have his way...

While she was thinking, Little Li Chef’s skewers were ready, fragrant and sizzling with oil.

Over there, Zhong Ling seemed to have made up her mind. After breaking the ice, she completely threw away her reserve.

“Big Brother, have one~” Zhong Ling moved swiftly, picking up a skewer of grilled leeks.

“Pfft— *cough cough cough*!”

Zhong Zhenyue was choked by the chili powder and coughed violently.

“...”

Ying Bing frowned slightly.

Well, she is older than Li Mo, so calling him ‘Big Brother’ is a bit strange...

“Hmm...”

Li Mo thought about it and realized he seemed to have overlooked something.

Are they not blood-related? Does Old Zhong know about this?

Just at that moment.

Zhong Ling seemed to be losing her patience. She slammed the silver ornament on her head onto the table and grabbed him by the collar.

“You little brat, don’t you dare act tough with me. Eat it for me!”

“Okay, Sis, you... you’re choking me...”

Zhong Zhenyue behaved.

Well, the mighty Eight-Armed Young Flood Dragon, Young Master Zhong Zhenyue, was now eating skewers, small, helpless, and pitiful.

“Pfft...”

Student Li sighed, but couldn’t help but laugh.

It was a failed negotiation that turned into a forced attack. Half of the strategy they had discussed wasn’t used, it was all wasted.

The people around couldn’t help but find it amusing.

Zhong Zhenyue was embarrassed. While Zhong Ling went to get drinks, he lowered his voice and asked:

“Brother Li, what’s wrong with her?”

“Old Zhong, didn’t you say you were envious that the brothers all have families?”

“Yeah.”

“Have you ever heard this poem? ‘I searched for him a thousand times in the crowd, and suddenly I turned, and there he was where the lights were dim.’”

Zhong Zhenyue fell into deep thought.

Ying Bing’s eyelashes trembled slightly. She tilted her head, taking in the sight of the少年(youth) speaking with such conviction.

At this moment, the tavern was noisy and bustling, the aroma of barbecue filled the air, and the smoke of human life was hazy. Yet, he became increasingly clear in her heart. Even with her eyes closed, she knew exactly what expression he would have.

Zhong Zhenyue seemed to understand but not quite:

“Brother Li, what does that mean? Can you make it more straightforward?”

“If your biological sister wasn’t your biological sister...”

“?”

“Would you want to kiss your sister?”

“?????”

Little Li Student felt he had done his best.

Even if he lost this round, he was still the SVP (Survivor Valuable Player)!

Just as he was thinking this, a skewer of meat was brought to his mouth. Little Li Student thought, *although my hand has a mind of its own, it shouldn’t be feeding me automatically, right?* So he turned his head and found Ice Cube looking down at him.

She was holding a skewer of grilled mushrooms.

“Eat.”

“Hmm?”

“Little brat, eat.”

...

PS: Sneak attack! Hehe.

The little author really didn’t go play *Black Myth: Wukong*. Is it fun?
