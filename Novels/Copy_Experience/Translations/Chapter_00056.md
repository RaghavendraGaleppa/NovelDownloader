# Chapter 56: Qi Condensation Layer 8

[First-grade High-rank Talisman Master: 32/100 (10x)]

"Copy!" Lu Xu silently roared in his heart. A flash of green light later, 320 copy points disappeared from the cyan stone tablet, and a torrent of information surged into his mind.

Lu Xu's eyes were glazed over, but his body, propelled by inertia, continued to slowly walk forward.

After several breaths, he regained his senses and followed Talisman Master Wang into his house.

"Where was Fellow Daoist Han from previously? This old man hails from the State of Zhao and has been in Wanxian City for over fifty years!"

"I am from the State of Wei and have only been in Wanxian City for a year!"

"The State of Wei? Oh, this old man has also heard that a great war seems to have broken out in your State of Wei. Many fellow Daoists who have come to Wanxian City this past year are from Wei!"

"Alas, it's always the struggles between those major powers that inadvertently affect us innocent ones!" Lu Xu sighed deeply.

"Indeed, these people fight endlessly, never resting!" Talisman Master Wang also sighed.

The great war in the State of Wei had already lasted for a year.

Initially, the Wei Emperor and two Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Wei clan died in the sudden attack by the Thousand Absolute Sect's Old Ancestor, but the grand formation of the Wei capital did not break.

The Crown Prince of the State of Wei had secretly achieved Foundation Establishment at some unknown time. After the Wei Emperor's death, he immediately ascended the throne to preside over the Wei capital's grand formation, leaving the Golden Core Old Ancestor helpless.

As a result, a few months after this Golden Core Old Ancestor of the Thousand Absolute Sect returned to his sect, he passed away due to old age.

With his death, the power dynamic in the State of Wei drastically changed. The Thousand Absolute Sect could no longer maintain its crushing superiority.

Thus, the great war suddenly intensified.

Both factions had cultivators at the Great Perfection of Foundation Establishment, and more than one at that. No one knew how long their war would continue.

"Since I've arrived in Wanxian City, the troubles of the State of Wei no longer concern me. The most important thing now is to live stably here!" Lu Xu said with a smile.

Talisman Master Wang nodded, "Precisely. Fellow Daoist Han appears quite young; perhaps you'll even have a chance to reach Foundation Establishment!"

After exchanging pleasantries with the renowned High-rank Talisman Master for a while, Lu Xu presented his gift and then returned to his own home.

He inwardly inspected himself:

[Name: Lu Xu]
[Lifespan: 31/131]
[Cultivation: Qi Condensation Layer 7, Body Forging First Stage]
[Spiritual Root: Wood (Lower-Mid)]
[Cultivation Arts: Azurewood Art (Great Perfection): 1000/1000; Imperial Dao Body Forging Art (Minor Accomplishment): 273/300]
[Copy Points: 192]

[Skill — Alchemy]:
[First-grade High-rank Alchemist: 57/100 (10x)]

[Skill — Talisman Crafting]:
[First-grade Mid-rank Talisman Master: 81/100 (3x)]
[First-grade High-rank Talisman Master: 40/100 (10x)]

[Skill — Spells]:
The experience for First-grade Low-rank Talisman Master had disappeared; it seemed to have reached max level.

"The success rate for First-grade Mid-rank talismans has reached eighty percent, not bad, not bad. I can make more Mid-rank talismans from now on. As for High-rank talismans, it's better not to sell them for now; I should mainly use them myself!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

Just like High-rank pills, High-rank talismans were rarely circulated on the market.

On one hand, this was because the number of High-rank Talisman Masters was very small to begin with.

On the other hand, the talisman crafting ability of these Talisman Masters was also quite limited.

Even those with higher success rates could not produce High-rank talismans in large quantities.

This was because crafting a single High-rank talisman consumed an enormous amount of mental energy.

This meant that most High-rank Talisman Masters could only hope to craft one High-rank talisman every ten to fifteen days.

Their annual output was only a few dozen talismans, and it was precisely for this reason that the quantity of High-rank talismans circulating in the cultivation world was very low.

Coupled with their success rate, even some diligent High-rank Talisman Masters could at most craft thirty or so High-rank talismans in a year.

Of course, Lu Xu's mental energy far surpassed that of ordinary cultivators, and his talisman crafting output was also much higher than other cultivators.

When crafting talismans with full effort, he could produce one High-rank talisman in five or six days.

The price of a High-rank talisman ranged from ten to fifteen spirit stones, meaning he could earn six hundred to nine hundred spirit stones a year from High-rank talismans.

"Still not as good as making Low-rank or Mid-rank talismans!" Lu Xu sighed inwardly.

After all, his success rate for those two types of talismans was simply too high.

After copying the Talisman Master's experience, Lu Xu immediately increased the supply of talismans to the market in the second year.

He Qi and Luo Chuan also worked desperately to help him sell talismans.

Thus, a whole year passed.

His two employees helped him sell over six hundred First-grade Low-rank talismans and over seventy First-grade Mid-rank talismans.

At the same time, the five bottles of Qi Replenishing Pills that Lu Xu put up for sale for the first time were also all sold out.

After deducting various costs, Lu Xu earned eight hundred spirit stones.

His two employees also profited immensely; their salaries for that year were forty spirit stones each, which was much higher than what they earned when working for Gao Yi.

"See? I told you from the start that I wouldn't treat you unfairly!" Lu Xu said at the year-end summary, looking at the two beaming employees.

"Thank you for your guidance, Shopkeeper! Your great kindness is unforgettable!" The two quickly bowed to Lu Xu to express their gratitude.

However, their gratitude was somewhat complicated. On one hand, they were happy about the surge in their income, but on the other, they felt a sense of melancholy.

To help Lu Xu sell talismans, their personal time had been severely compressed.

Their progress in cultivation and learning talisman crafting was severely delayed, and their minds were constantly occupied with how to sell more talismans.

Previously, when they worked for Gao Yi, they were very relaxed. The two would take turns manning the shop, staying there all day waiting for customers to come.

Now, to generate higher sales, they even had to go out themselves to solicit customers.

Those days, thinking about them brought tears to their eyes!

Lu Xu then spoke, "Actually, in my opinion, your income can still increase. What's forty spirit stones? As long as you work hard, one hundred spirit stones isn't a dream!"

"Huh?" Both of them were dumbfounded upon hearing this.

"Aren't you taking turns manning the shop? On the days you're not in the shop, don't just sit idle. Go out and promote talismans, promote pills, and get to know as many customers as possible!"

"Then... then are we still cultivating?" Luo Chuan stammered.

"Foolish! Work hard for a few more years while you're young, save up more spirit stones, and won't your life be more comfortable later? If you don't strive now, do you wait until you're old to fight for it?"

And so, under Lu Xu's earnest teachings, He Qi and Luo Chuan worked even harder.

In the third year after Lu Xu took over the shop, he earned twelve hundred spirit stones.

In the fourth year, with Qi Nurturing Pills also entering Yifang Chamber, Lu Xu's earnings reached an impressive fifteen hundred spirit stones.

While busy earning spirit stones, Lu Xu did not neglect his cultivation.

With the continuous aid of pills, by the end of the fourth year, he successfully entered Qi Condensation Layer 8.
