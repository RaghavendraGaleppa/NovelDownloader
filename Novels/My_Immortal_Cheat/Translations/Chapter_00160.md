# Chapter 160: Heavenly Venerate Tomb

“I won't hide it from you. The item I want is crucial to me. Even just a part of Buddha Wutian's remains would be enough for me to act against your Zhou family. That item is his sarira, and I must obtain it!”

“I know you possess special methods, but I also know that everything comes at a price. You wouldn't want me to spend the rest of my time researching how to deal with you, unless you can kill me right now!”

Seeing Zhou Tian's silence, Saint Devil spoke bluntly. A hint of madness flashed across his usually gentle face, his eyes gleaming like the sun.

Zhou Tian frowned slightly. It was clear Saint Devil was overtly threatening him, but Saint Devil was right. If he truly dedicated himself to studying ways to deal with Zhou Tian in the future, he might very well find a method. Moreover, if Saint Devil targeted Tian Ling, she genuinely wouldn't be able to withstand it.

Tian Ling did not grow up in the Zhou family from childhood, and thus didn't have the various protective measures the Zhou family arranged for their descendants. Although becoming Zhou Tian's fiancée would grant her corresponding protections, they hadn't been put in place yet. And most crucially, the soul lamp method couldn't be supplemented later.

“Isn't this a trade? What do I get?”

Zhou Tian didn't mention the fact that Saint Devil had already become a guest elder of the Zhou family. Although it was stipulated that he couldn't act against the Zhou family, Saint Devil was clearly willing to pay any price to resolve his own issues, even sacrificing his own life.

“Aside from that sarira, everything else in that place belongs to you.”

Saint Devil returned to his normal state, the mad expression gone.

“How do I know what's in that place?”

Zhou Tian's brow furrowed slightly. What if that place only contained the sarira? He'd suffer a huge loss.

Saint Devil revealed a mysterious smile and uttered, “That place is a Heavenly Venerate's tomb.”

“A Heavenly Venerate's tomb!?”

Zhou Tian was startled. Good heavens, he hadn't expected Saint Devil to have such a major piece of news. That was a Heavenly Venerate's tomb, who knew how many treasures it contained.

“Is it the tomb of the one named Buddha Wutian?” Zhou Tian asked.

“It's not his tomb. He rose to fame during the Nine Realms Era, a time when there weren't so many Heavenly Venerates. Records indicate there was at most one Half-step Heavenly Venerate. I'm not sure whose tomb it specifically is,” Saint Devil explained. Although he could confirm through special means that Wutian's sarira was indeed in that tomb, and had even seen it with his own eyes, he didn't know which world it belonged to, or which Heavenly Venerate's tomb it was.

“So that tomb is in the Star Realm, then?”

“That's right.” Saint Devil nodded. How could there still be an unknown Heavenly Venerate's tomb in the Nine Provinces?

“Can we wait until the commotion in the Land of the Abandoned Gods subsides?” Zhou Tian said. Recently, the Land of the Abandoned Gods had been turbulent. The time for the Heavenly Mandate to emerge was approaching. Zhou Changsheng had told him that many Star Realm forces were eyeing it covetously. At the very least, he could serve as a high-end combatant for 32 seconds.

“You don't need to worry about that.” Saint Devil's hair flowed, each strand crystalline and brilliant, his eyes like crimson suns. He pointed a finger at the void. “Heaven's Gate has already descended. Moreover, it's unlikely the Heavenly Mandate of the Land of the Abandoned Gods will emerge for some time.”

Only then did Zhou Tian realize that in the direction of the Nine Provinces' encampment, a colossal city floated, its stone walls mottled, adorned with soaring phoenixes and dragons. It had completely entered war mode. Riders on Scarlet Flood Dragons and Violet Lightning Lions patrolled the four directions, and grand formations extended into the void.

It had shrunk considerably compared to what he had seen in the void that day. Coupled with his continuous conversation with Saint Devil, he hadn't noticed it until now.

He hadn't expected Heaven's Gate to have already descended. Many things would be much easier then, Zhou Tian mused. But then he remembered the latter half of Saint Devil's statement, and feeling a little strange, he asked, “What do you mean the Heavenly Mandate shouldn't emerge for some time?”

Saint Devil smiled faintly, his eyes glowing with a profound depth as he stared at Zhou Tian and said, “Originally, the King of Gods, as a being who once carried the Heavenly Mandate of the God Realm, still had a shred of influence over it. It was through this influence that he could make the Heavenly Mandate emerge prematurely, disrupting many of your Nine Provinces' plans.”

Zhou Tian felt his scalp tingle under Saint Devil's gaze. As if multiple personalities weren't enough, did this guy have some weird kinks too?

“Their plan was likely to use the King of Gods' remnant soul to directly cause the Heavenly Mandate to emerge after the Pantheon appeared, and then choose a certain deity to bear it. But who would have thought you would appear out of nowhere and directly fight him off? Now the Heavenly Mandate has returned to a dormant state, and it will probably be difficult for it to emerge for some time. I only deduced this afterward by combining various pieces of information. The King of Gods was once an ancient titan; I never expected all his schemes to be completely shattered by you.”

“Oh?” Zhou Tian's eyebrows raised. So there was this underlying reason. He waved his hand nonchalantly and said, “I didn't expect it either. I just casually made a move. One can only say that life is full of uncertainties, truly unpredictable.”

Watching Zhou Tian's slightly smug expression, Saint Devil spoke, “It's precisely this reason that led to my transaction with a certain mysterious organization leader being postponed. I temporarily cannot obtain Wutian's remains, and I've reached a critical juncture. I can only risk considering the sarira, which is why I came to you.”

Zhou Tian's expression stiffened. What was this supposed to be?

“Alright, I've explained everything clearly to you. Let's go,” Saint Devil said to Zhou Tian. The reason he explained so much to Zhou Tian temporarily was because he didn't want Zhou Tian to use those methods to fight him to the death.

“You at least have to let me go back and report that I'm safe, lest they all think I've been completely annihilated,” Zhou Tian said.

“Don't your Zhou family have those soul lamps? They definitely know you're not dead.” Saint Devil didn't want any more complications. Heaven's Gate had already descended, and he no longer had the standing to negotiate. He certainly didn't want to test that terrifying war fortress.

“Right.” Zhou Tian's eyes flickered. He didn't mention that his soul lamp had actually been used up long ago, and the Zhou family no longer had a way to detect if he had died.

Since Saint Devil didn't want him to go back, he didn't insist. After all this time, some of his divine peculiarities had been revealed, and with Zhou Zui, who had personally witnessed his revival, even if the self-detonation scene had looked grand, it was merely dying once.

“Let's go.” Saint Devil waved a large hand, and space shifted. The two were already in the void of the Land of the Abandoned Gods. Dark void storms raged, but all of them subsided as they approached.

Saint Devil took out several black-gold glistening stones of various shapes and sizes, none larger than a fist. Their surfaces were engraved with dense symbols, from which golden light flowed.

Whoosh! Two golden lights shot out from Saint Devil's eyes. His pupils were entirely golden, and mysterious symbols floated within their depths.
