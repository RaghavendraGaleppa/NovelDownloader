# Chapter 22: Ying Bing's Worries, The Inheritance Land

Autumn Water Pavilion.

At this moment, the aroma of cumin and grease permeated the small courtyard.

"Barbecue! Five taels of silver per skewer, but if you're pretty, it's free!"

"Here, you're a beauty, so here's a skewer for you~"

Li Mo had dug out a winter charcoal brazier to use as a grill, skewering beast meat from Treasure Beast Peak. It sizzled as it cooked, dripping with oil. While grilling, he hawked his wares in an amusing tone.

"My good disciple, were you a chef in your previous life?"

Shang Wu took a bite, her almond eyes showing pure bliss. She had eaten barbecue before. But why was her disciple's so delicious? Especially that unique aroma, perfectly blended with the charred scent of the meat – it was absolutely divine.

Li Mo smiled, picking up a few more skewers. "Wow, another beauty! This black-horned lamb nourishes Yin and replenishes blood; it's on me."

"It's very delicious." Ying Bing took a small bite, chewing slowly. The 'ice block' gave a four-character-long high praise, indicating the taste was indeed excellent.

"Hoo-ha....hoo-ha...." Shang Wu loved spicy food and kept exhaling. Even Ying Bing, who usually preferred light meals, indulged herself for once. After all, eating as it grilled, she lost track of how much she had consumed.

"Little Bing'er, you understand respecting your master best, so this skewer of grilled fish should be mine."

"But you're not my master."

"You've eaten a lot, little girls who eat so much will get fat."

"I'm still growing."

"Oh, you live with Li Mo every day; just have him make it for you next time."

Shang Wu crossed her arms, pouting indignantly. She couldn't even coax or trick this little girl out of a skewer of grilled fish; it was infuriating!

Ying Bing ate the grilled fish, tucking a strand of black hair behind her ear, a hint of a smile not quite hidden. She thought of the past. In her blurry memories of the Eastern Desolation, only a few important people had left a deep impression on her. Shang Wu was among them. When the Clear Stream Sect fell, if not for Shang Wu, she likely wouldn't have escaped Purple Sun Prefecture alive. Alas... Shaking her head, Ying Bing dispelled the distracting thoughts in her mind. In this life, those tragedies would never repeat.

"Good meat naturally calls for good wine." Li Mo also sat down at the table to eat. In his hand was a bottle of wine, contained in jade-colored white porcelain. As he pulled out the stopper, a spicy yet refreshing aroma instantly diffused. The wine poured out. It astonishingly separated into distinct red and blue colors in the cup.

"What kind of wine is this? It smells so good!" Shang Wu twitched her delicate nose, sniffed, and immediately perked up, her almond eyes widening slightly.

"Icefire Wine." Li Mo smiled, placing a wine bowl in front of Shang Wu. As he spoke, he poured another cup. This one was for the 'ice block'. Ying Bing's crescent-moon-like brows subtly lifted. She picked up the cup, examining it closely, her mirror-like eyes reflecting the two-colored wine, a truly beautiful sight.

This item originated from Jade Spring Island in the Northern Sea. There was a spring there, half cold and half hot all year round, possessing the wondrous effect of tempering the physique. A wine-making clan on the island specialized in using its waters for brewing, and the resulting wine was likewise, hence named Icefire Wine. Although that clan focused on wine-making, it was still a formidable power, even compared to the Clear Stream Sect. Each year, the clan would offer hundreds of types of fine wines as tribute to the Laurel Palace, including this Icefire Wine. By then, she no longer needed it and typically used it to reward promising disciples. Why did Li Mo possess this wine?

"My dearest disciple, where did you get this wine?" Shang Wu, her cheeks flushed from the Icefire Wine, spoke in such a soft whisper for the first time. Her almond eyes blinked gently, like ripples on water.

"....." Li Mo leaned back strategically. It was hard to imagine that the delicate woman before him was capable of punching a mountain peak to smithereens. "I stumbled into a secret realm and only managed to get a few jars." Young Li blurted out.

"Oh? You have such good fortune; no wonder you could enter the third level of the Divine Peak Cave unscathed." Shang Wu didn't find anything wrong with his explanation. Ying Bing took a sip, understanding dawning in her heart. She probably had a guess. Li Mo had likely obtained some inheritance. Relying on treasures left in that inheritance, he had changed his physique. The Icefire Wine was also a remnant from the inheritance, used to temper the inheritor's body. Perhaps... it was during those few days when she was opening her meridians in Purple Sun Prefecture City?

That's good. At least in the future, he would have the chance to inherit Shang Wu's mantle and become an Elder of the Clear Stream Sect. For him, this was already a significant change of fate.

"Hmph, fine." Shang Wu pursed her lips and downed the wine in one gulp.

"There are still a few jars of Icefire Wine left. If Master likes it, why not take a jar?"

"No need, you keep it. This wine can temper the body, but I no longer need it."

"Then next time I go down the mountain, I'll bring Master a few more jars of good wine." Li Mo was a little surprised. He picked up a wine cup and took a sip. Only then. The next moment, he realized something was off. He remembered he hadn't poured wine for himself, so what he just drank... was Ying Bing's cup?

"Little Bing'er, what's wrong?" Shang Wu tilted her head, noticing Ying Bing seemed a little stunned.

"Nothing." Ying Bing frowned, gently shaking her head.

"Oh, oh, then you should drink more! This wine is very beneficial for those in the Qi-Blood Realm." As Shang Wu spoke, she picked up the small gourd from her waist and gulped down two mouthfuls. Li Mo lightly coughed, got her a new cup, and poured it full.

"Mm." Ying Bing sipped her wine. Just now, her calm inner lake seemed to have a faint, almost imperceptible ripple? This was what made her feel strange. Among the men who had pursued her, some possessed unparalleled talent through the ages, some had peerless natural aptitude, some had terrifying backgrounds. Even before she became one of the Nine Heavens, Cang Tian, one of the Nine Heavens, had expressed his admiration for her. Let alone giving him any encouragement. She hadn't even harbored a single thought. Over time, everyone in the world said that the Empress who long resided in the Laurel Palace was ice in body and mind, devoid of the seven emotions and six desires. In truth, she was simply steadfastly pursuing the martial dao. The mortal world wears down a hero's bones; love and affection are merely stumbling blocks. But just now, when that unusual feeling arose in her heart, she surprisingly didn't reject it...

"Perhaps it's because of the Icefire Wine..." Ying Bing finished the Icefire Wine, not bothering to savor its taste. "At my current realm, I cannot ignore the effects of intoxication." Recalling her thoughts, she silently guided the surge of wine essence to circulate within her body.

"Practice diligently during this time." Shang Wu finished speaking, then yawned. "In a while, the sect will have a trial for new disciples. Don't disgrace your master, okay?"

"Trial?" Li Mo looked bewildered.

Shang Wu wiped the sparkling wine stain from the corner of her mouth. "It's simply placing you all in the Clear Stream Mountain Range to collect some herbs, slay some exotic beasts, and so on. For those in the Qi-Blood Realm, it's quite a challenge. Some Rank Nine demonic beasts are rather difficult to deal with. When the time comes, you and Little Bing'er can look out for each other."

Li Mo nodded, roughly understanding what was going on. A common trope in novels. He was slightly speechless. "Master, Ying Bing is the Sect Master's disciple; her treatment is much better than mine. How could she need to look out for me?" Speaking of which, when Master took him in, it seemed to be because she was interested in Ying Bing? They had just met, and she was already calling her 'Little Bing'er'. Ying Bing didn't seem to reject it either; it was as if the two had known each other for a long time.

"Who said your master doesn't care about you?" Shang Wu twitched her delicate nose and took out a small booklet. "Take this and practice. It's a Middle-tier martial art; for your current level, it's just right. It's certainly much better than Six Harmonies Fist." Written on the booklet was: *Liaoyuan Sword Art*. Don't just look at it being a Middle-tier martial art. Outside, it would be a foundational treasure, enough for many sects to rely on. Many minor sects still regarded Low-tier, or even unranked, martial arts as precious treasures.

"Thank you, Master."

"Hmph, you were just complaining about me." With that, Shang Wu waved her hand, carrying her small gourd, and left the Autumn Water Pavilion.

At the table, Ying Bing put down her wine cup, her mind returning to peace. For the sect trial, what she needed to do, no one could help her with. She was going to acquire an inheritance. Although she didn't know who left the inheritance Li Mo obtained, compared to what she was about to receive, it was absolutely worlds apart. After all, no true powerhouse would leave their inheritance in the barren Eastern Desolation Region. The inheritance she was going to activate was different. It was not left by a 'person'.
