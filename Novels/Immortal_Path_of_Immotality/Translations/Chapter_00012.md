# Chapter 12: The Unpredictable Turns of Life

As evening approached, fiery clouds painted the sky crimson.  

After traveling thirty or forty li south, Lin Shan spotted a small town nestled among rolling hills. Descending the mountain along a winding path, he could make out two large characters on the city gate: "Yongchang."  

He found a woodcutter's family outside the city and learned that Yongchang County was still about a hundred li south of the Zangke Commandery.  

Having exhausted himself from the day's journey, Lin Shan had no desire to sleep in the wild. He discarded his escort bureau uniform and changed into spare clothes from his pack. After showing his travel permit to the city guards, he entered the small county town without incident.  

Inside the city, he found a tavern and ordered a lavish feast. After eating his fill, he booked a room at an inn and enjoyed a comfortable bath. With money in his pocket, Lin Shan felt much more at ease.  

---  

That night, lying on the inn's bed, Lin Shan tossed and turned, unable to sleep.  

After all, he had narrowly escaped death during his first escort mission—an experience that would unsettle anyone.  

He got up and went to the inn's courtyard. The bright moon hung high in the sky, surrounded by countless stars. The chirping of crickets filled the summer night, and the silhouettes of the surrounding mountains were clearly visible beyond the city walls.  

Lin Shan practiced the Evergreen Technique for a while before pulling out the hexagonal token he had acquired earlier that day. Engraved with the characters "Xin Twenty-One," it had been taken from the stocky man he had encountered.  

The other token, "Bing Twenty-Five," belonging to the tall, lean man, had already been absorbed by Lin Shan during his journey, its ancient essence consumed before it turned to dust.  

As Lin Shan stood in the courtyard, lost in thought, he recalled Master Pu's description of the "Nightingale," the assassin organization. A sense of unease crept over him. Would these assassins come after him during his travels in Zangke Commandery?  

He considered discarding the token in the wilderness but feared he might never find it again. It seemed wiser to hide it somewhere safe and retrieve it once his martial skills improved.  

After all, if he could use it to obtain more tokens in the future, he might uncover additional sources of "ancient essence."  

His current strength was still far too lacking.  

As he pondered, the night suddenly grew eerily silent. The chirping of insects vanished, replaced by an unsettling atmosphere.  

Lin Shan felt the token in his hand grow inexplicably warm.  

Following an instinctive premonition, he turned his head and saw a figure standing atop the courtyard wall, silhouetted against the full moon.  

Cloaked in black with a sword in hand, the figure's robes fluttered in the night breeze.  

"Black robes... a sword..."  

Despite the cool night air, beads of sweat formed on Lin Shan's forehead. His eyes locked onto the figure, his body frozen in place.  

He had seen this person earlier that day in a valley dozens of li away—the very man who had effortlessly slain Wang, the escort leader and a first-rate martial artist. The memory was seared into his mind.  

---  

Yes, it was the leader of the black-clad bandits!  

Lin Shan's mind went blank, leaving no room for coherent thought.  

The moonlit figure extended a hand toward him, and a deep voice echoed through the night.  

"Hand it over."  

Lin Shan snapped back to reality. Realizing what the man wanted, he immediately tossed the token into the air.  

The black-clad leader reached out, and the hexagonal token defied gravity, flying straight into his grasp.  

After examining it for a long moment, the deep voice spoke again.  

"Fatty Li was one of my few capable subordinates. To think he died at the hands of a brat who just reached the Breath Exchange realm."  

"Interesting."  

Chuckling to himself, the black-clad leader let out a low, sinister laugh that sent chills down Lin Shan's spine.  

Fatty Li? The stocky man from the forest earlier—the one at the Organ Refinement stage?  

It made sense. The man had wielded an internal palm technique, likely bestowed by the black-clad leader, which explained why he had been so formidable.  

Drenched in cold sweat, Lin Shan dared not argue. He had planned to study the token before hiding it away, never expecting the leader to arrive so quickly.  

The fact that he had survived while the token ended up in his possession spoke for itself. The black-clad leader had lost a long-trained subordinate and was likely here for revenge.  

Before Lin Shan could finish his thoughts, the figure on the wall laughed eerily and suddenly tossed the token back to him.  

Lin Shan caught it, bewildered.  

Was the leader not seeking vengeance? He had heard that members of assassin organizations were capricious by nature—perhaps this was just another example of their unpredictability?  

"That useless Fatty Li is dead, and good riddance. The Nightingale recognizes tokens, not people. I have no interest in pursuing this matter."  

The black-clad leader studied Lin Shan for a moment, his sharp eyes seemingly piercing through him. After a brief pause, he nodded slowly.  

"You've got potential, but not much."  

Lin Shan: "???"  

The words, combined with the moonlit setting, radiated an aura of disdain—as if the leader viewed everyone as beneath him. Stirred by his transmigrator's soul, Lin Shan felt an inexplicable urge to respond.  

Just as he was about to step forward and try to strike up a conversation, the black-clad leader leaped down, placed a hand on his shoulder, and—without waiting for a response—hauled him over the wall.  

Using the Lightness Technique, the leader bounded across rooftops, carrying Lin Shan like a helpless chick in an eagle's grasp. Lin Shan's qi remained frozen, his dantian sealed.  

---  

Dizzy from the wind rushing past, Lin Shan barely registered when they finally arrived at their destination. The black-clad leader unceremoniously tossed him into a new courtyard.  

As his qi circulation returned, Lin Shan shook his head and stood up, only to find dozens of pairs of eyes staring at him in the dim light.  

"..."  

Now he could see clearly—over twenty black-clad figures sat cross-legged in the courtyard, the same ones he had encountered in the valley earlier that day.  

Life was truly unpredictable. He had met them in the morning and now reunited with them at night—and soon, they would become his comrades.  

"This is the new recruit. I happened to pick him up on my way. He'll replace Fatty Li starting tomorrow. For now, stay put until the mission begins. If anyone dares to act out..."  

The voice faded as the black-clad leader departed, leaving behind only a black robe, headscarf, and face veil, which landed on Lin Shan's head.  

"Wait... so I'm just part of the Nightingale now? Just like that? No initiation, just free work attire?"  

Still in disbelief, Lin Shan hesitantly changed into the assassin's outfit, struggling to process the night's events.  

That morning, he had set out to make his mark in the martial world. By nightfall, he had been forcibly recruited by the Nightingale's leader, with no chance to refuse.  

When he finally regained his composure, he noticed the dozens of eyes still fixed on him, sending an uncomfortable shiver down his spine.  

Fortunately, most of the assassins were merely curious and soon lost interest, closing their eyes to rest. Only one continued to glare at him with murderous intensity.  

"Huh? That guy looks familiar..."  

Though everyone wore black face veils, Lin Shan could make out a scar running down the man's brow under the moonlight.  

"Holy crap! Scarface!"  

Lin Shan's heart skipped a beat. Of all people, he had to run into this guy again!  

Truly, life was unpredictable—full of twists and turns!  

Scarface's hate-filled gaze never wavered, as if he wanted to devour Lin Shan alive. Lin Shan had no doubt that, had the leader not issued his warning, Scarface would have lunged at him without hesitation.  

After all, during the earlier ambush, Lin Shan had nearly killed him. No one would let such a grudge slide easily. Even if Scarface claimed otherwise, Lin Shan wouldn't believe him—not when a knife in the back was always a possibility.  

This wasn't about pettiness. In the martial world, any potential threat had to be eliminated before it could take root. With only one life to live, no one would gamble on another's mercy.  

"So the feud is set. I'll have to strike first when the chance comes."  

Lin Shan began plotting how to eliminate Scarface while maintaining a calm facade, closing his eyes to meditate.  

On the other side, Scarface gnashed his teeth in frustration. "Damn brat! This morning, he was our target. By nightfall, he's one of us. Who knew he'd be such a tough nut to crack? I misjudged him!"  

Regret gnawed at him. His earlier outburst had revealed his identity too soon. With the kid's sharp wits, he would have figured it out eventually—but now, Scarface would have to bide his time.  

A sinister grin curled beneath his black veil.
