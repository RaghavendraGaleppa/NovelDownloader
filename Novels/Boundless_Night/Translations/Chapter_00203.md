Chapter 203: Alien Journey (Combined Chapters)

The Night Mist World was as dark as an abyss, with cities flickering like candlelight. This high plateau was no exception, only the areas where fiery springs surged glowed with light.

However, the Secret Realm was not dark, even without fiery springs. It was like the "twilight" described in ancient texts, everything bathed in a mist of light, displaying a variety of colors, predominantly crimson, pervasive throughout the forest.

People felt themselves shrink, as mountains rapidly magnified. From the outside, the ground looked like nothing but "moss," but what they saw now was utterly extraordinary: giant flowers large enough for several people to lie inside, easily serving as makeshift shelters. Foxtail grass was thick and long, dangling in mid-air like a dragon's tail.

"We are treading on a planet that fell from beyond the sky," Zhao Muyao of Pure Yang Academy remarked, carefully observing the terrain.

Jiang Ruoli of Bodhi Academy added, "Thinking about it, it truly is quite dreamlike. A celestial body landed here, looking small, yet so extraordinary. It once hung high in the outer reaches; we are standing on an alien world."

The men present were more pragmatic, devoid of romantic notions or special sentiments about worlds beyond the sky.

Xiao Wu tugged at the giant foxtail grass. "Ladies, why don't we swing on this alien world? Experience some exotic flair!"

Silence immediately fell over the group.

Qin Ming quickly pulled him aside. This brother was still too unsophisticated. Even if those women had rejected them, he shouldn't be spouting such nonsense. Clearly, Xiao Wu still harbored some resentment, determined not to suffer any verbal losses.

Not far away, both the two women who had just spoken, and those like Lin Qianyi and Xiao Yaqin who were about to speak, all fell silent, their faces slightly dark. Their beautiful fantasies about a world beyond had been thoroughly shattered; the atmosphere was gone.

The elder who had led them in turned to leave, surprisingly without saying much.

"Senior, our groups, whether from the previous cohort or new disciples of this one, can we truly contend for immortal seeds here?" Gan Jincheng of Skyroc Daoist Temple asked. Overall, they were considered "newcomers" and had no experience with such events. The other older disciples did not travel with them. Furthermore, with participants from the Beyond-the-World Region, Secret Sects, and various aberrant groups, the composition was complex.

The elder replied, "The Secret Realm is vast. Entering from different areas will place you extremely far apart, making it difficult for you to meet."

Then, he smiled slightly and said, "Do you think the strange substances and extraordinary spiritual herbs you see are the greatest fortunes, something you need to fight and snatch from each other? You are mistaken."

"Huh?" Everyone was stunned and quickly urged him to elaborate. Their academy seniors hadn't mentioned any of this, because this was a newly conquered Secret Realm, quite different from others.

The elder said, "Don't worry, you'll know soon enough. By then, you won't even have the inclination to fight others. This place is very special; you need to 'savor' it with your heart. The benefits are considerable."

Upon hearing this, the groups grew even more curious and humbly sought guidance.

He smiled, "This is a test of your keen spiritual sensitivity. Observe and grasp it yourselves. I will only say this much: even formidable figures like Pu Heng and the Qing Tian Sect disciples have entered here and gained something."

The group was stunned. Who was Pu Heng? Cao Qianqiu's head disciple! And a young master from the Qing Tian Sect, both had investigated this place. It must be truly extraordinary.

"Even Senior Sun might have personally visited," the elder whispered.

Everyone was lost in thought. The Senior Sun he spoke of surely referred to Sun Taichu. Such a powerful master, accomplished in creation itself, had graced this place? Instantly, the group was invigorated and immensely excited, some youths nearly crying out.

Then, they calmed down. "Won't it be very dangerous?" If such great figures were interested, this place was definitely not ordinary, perhaps even terrifying.

The elder shook his head, "Don't worry, this place varies from person to person. Besides, you won't trigger those things. Even if I pointed you in the right direction, you wouldn't be able to follow in the footsteps of the senior master."

A large group of people mused, carefully pondering his words, deciphering the valuable information contained within. This star fragment must be truly astonishing.

After speaking, the elder prepared to leave. He saw a youth digging for jade in stone and stuffing it into his pockets, couldn't help but ask, "What are you doing?"

Qin Ming awkwardly smiled, "Sumeru is contained in a mustard seed. I wonder if these stones from here can be used for storage." He dug out two pieces of jade, throwing one to Xiao Wu.

The elder said, "You are quite clever, but you won't be able to use them once you take them out. Even the seniors above had to spend a great deal of effort to carve out spatial dimensions." Then, he looked at Qin Ming repeatedly, saying, "You are a Newcomer. It's a pity, you are lacking in the spiritual domain. Here, you need keen spiritual sensitivity. You won't do well; it'll be tough for you."

Having said that, he stepped out of the area and quickly disappeared.

"That old geezer," Xiao Wu muttered, pouting.

Except for the Newcomers, everyone else was delighted, as the elder had subtly hinted at more valuable information.

Wang Lijie of Dragon Elephant Daoist Temple said, "Everyone, there must be astonishing fortune here, otherwise why would Senior Sun visit, or Young Master Pu Heng and others come personally? Let's deliberate, in what direction should we exert ourselves, and what exactly is the situation?"

Su Junlin of Great Dream Daoist Temple said, "Let's just go straight ahead and explore. However, don't separate at first. After all, the academy teachers warned us that this place is not peaceful, and when certain crises appear, an entire team is needed to resist them."

For a moment, many looked at Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu. Their team was too "meager" and "simple," almost a joke. A group of youths felt that if these two didn't follow them, they probably wouldn't even make a ripple and would soon disappear, perishing in the Secret Realm.

Instantly, some pouted, others snickered.

Xiao Wu said, "What do you mean? Are you looking down on our elite team of two? You better not cry and beg my brother and me later!"

"Let's see how long you can be stubborn!"

"If you leave us, can the two of you even survive?!" Some people said, displeased.

Someone even suggested expelling the two, not letting them follow.

Suddenly, a commotion arose ahead, then someone quickly rushed out because they smelled a faint fragrance in this lush area. As they proceeded, the scent gradually intensified.

"Golden Orchids!" someone exclaimed.

The trees here were often hundreds of meters tall, and vines as thick as water barrels were common. Just ahead, a large cluster of orchids was fresh and dewy, practically dripping golden liquid, bright and dazzling. Two teams rushed over. Among them, two individuals were particularly aggressive, leaping forward to pounce on the Golden Orchids.

This was a very precious spiritual herb. When combined with other minerals and transformed into a golden liquid, it had miraculous healing effects, allowing one to recover quickly.

"Fragrant and rich, these are mutated Golden Orchids!" someone exclaimed in delight.

However, soon someone screamed in agony. The two who pounced sank down, then stumbled out, covered in a "thick fragrance."

Everyone was dumbfounded, then quickly retreated. Qin Ming and Xiao Wu were also stunned, quickly covering their mouths and noses and running backward.

"It's corpse rice!" Xiao Wu shamelessly shouted, feeling particularly disgusted. A patch of golden orchids had actually rooted in a large pile of corpse rice. The fragrance had covered the stench below. Now, those two youths were covered in filth, practically driven mad with rage.

Three maidens who had collected Golden Orchids instantly felt the flowers were no longer fragrant. Ashamed and enraged, they quickly threw them away, rubbing their fair hands repeatedly, wishing they could peel off a layer of skin.

No one had expected to be "taught a lesson" so soon after entering. It was truly a gruesome experience. The two main victims, covered in sticky grime, felt worse than being killed, almost collapsing.

"You've gone too far! Not only did you steal my spirit herbs, you also ruined my herb field! This is outrageous!" From a distance, a giant dung beetle pushed a "round ball" and came rolling in, truly dung-raged. It was two to three times larger than a tabletop, its body seemingly cast from dark gold, clattering as it moved, its claws tearing through some vines along the way.

Gan Jincheng looked at the affected members, then at the black armored beetle, truly unwilling to fight it. "Misunderstanding, we will leave immediately."

"I entered this area from the plateau and painstakingly cultivated these herbs for five years, but you ruined them! Pay with your lives!" the black beetle roared. Then, it suddenly spread its black shell, flapping its wings, coming as fast as a black lightning bolt.

Everyone realized there was no avoiding a fight. Disturbing its herb field was just an excuse for it to start a battle. This was a demon from the plateau; the two factions were now at war. If they met, they had to fight.

"Ah..." The two who had been affected earlier screamed consecutively, chilling many hearts. The two were torn apart, blood splattering everywhere. Although emotionally distraught, when the crisis appeared, their attacks were not slow, and they used their full strength, but they couldn't stop it and were torn to shreds.

No one expected the black beetle to be so strong. It had already entered the Second Realm, its body harder than refined iron. It was no small demon at all. Most terrifying was the constant, ear-splitting flapping sound, like grinding iron plates, giving people goosebumps. A total of eight black beetles appeared, flying like black lightning, all in the Second Realm.

"One team hunts one, the remaining teams provide support," Zhao Muyao shouted.

Wang Lijie said, "Don't panic. These demons from the plateau were waiting here to ambush us. There's nothing to fear; just eliminate them." Each team had experts. Once organized, dealing with Second Realm aberrations was not too difficult.

Instantly, spiritual light surged and divine perceptions erupted, with various spiritual artifacts flying, fiercely colliding with the beetles that seemed cast from dark gold, even sparking flames. This showed how incredibly hard they were.

Qin Ming felt that this alien journey was truly awful, encountering such foul-smelling bugs right at the start.

"What 'planet from the sky,' it's not romantic or beautiful at all!" Xiao Wu also complained.

The people nearby were exasperated. These two still had the leisure to comment? Especially Jiang Ruoli, Zhao Muyao, and the other leading women, who had just been fantasizing about a world beyond, filled with romantic sentiments. Now they glared at him.

"You two are no help, yet you make sarcastic remarks. You're just burdens, shut up!" Su Junlin even rebuked.

"Is that all? Just a few beetles!" Xiao Wu scoffed.

"Then you go up, kill them!" someone sneered. Now they had stabilized the situation, and some black beetles had been eliminated.

"An expert always has to anchor the formation, right? Actually, it's mainly because they stink too much," Xiao Wu said.

"Two burdens!" some people complained.

Liu Hanying even said coldly, "Don't tell anyone you two are from my Mountains and Rivers Academy. I don't know you!"

Just then, a shriek rang out. A snow-white beetle flew over, and wherever it passed, it sliced five people in half at the waist, causing immense damage. They had just entered the Secret Realm, and seven people had already died consecutively. It was a bloody journey. At this rate, who knew how many would perish.

The silver beetle was even stronger. Though there was only one, it heavily injured one of the teams. Its speed was incredibly fast. It caused such a situation immediately upon its appearance that even Qin Ming and Xiao Wu didn't react in time. Immediately, it swooped down towards Liu Hanying's group.

*Clang!* The spiritual artifact Liu Hanying deployed only managed to fend it off. Its terrifying claws, like finely crafted gold, merely grazed her armor, cutting several cracks and nearly drawing blood. This was only the initial clash, yet it was already like this. Her face was pale. If they were to engage in a fierce confrontation, she might also be torn apart.

The silver beetle was actually smaller than the other black beetles, only about the size of a tabletop, but its speed was fast, its power fierce, and the buzzing of its silver wings was like thunder. Wherever it passed, trees, vines, and other vegetation would be severed, or even explode. Many realized that this was a mutated insect. If it could continue to grow, it could become a Sacred Beetle!

"Clang!" It swooped for a second time. Liu Hanying staggered backward, her spiritual artifact damaged. The armor on her shoulder shattered, but fortunately, there was another layer of inner armor, otherwise her shoulder might have been torn open. Many felt alarmed, knowing she was actually very powerful, already noticed by an elder from the Immortal Land, possessing extraordinary talent.

*Clang!* Xiao Wu acted. Although he didn't suffer verbal losses, he wouldn't stand by and watch others die. He threw an iron spear he carried on his back, hitting the silver beetle. To Liu Hanying's surprise, the beetle shook violently in mid-air. Xiao Wu threw another iron spear. At the same time, Qin Ming also acted, because this silver beetle was indeed very strong. If left unchecked, more people would likely die. He threw an iron hammer.

The others also deployed their spiritual artifacts, attacking together. *Bang!* The silver beetle exploded.

Liu Hanying was shocked. She felt that although many people had attacked, it was ultimately Xiao Wu's iron spear and Shen Wubing's powerful hammer that had shattered it; it had nothing to do with the others.

"Thank you!" She stepped forward to express her gratitude, feeling ashamed of what she had said earlier.

"No need to thank me, Mountains and Rivers Number Two," Xiao Wu said, turning his back to her.

Liu Hanying's expression froze.

Qin Ming smiled and said, "Helping each other."

"Thank you!" Liu Hanying whispered.

All the beetles were eliminated. They had just started their journey, yet seven people had already died. It was truly an inauspicious beginning, and the atmosphere became somewhat somber. For a while, the teams did not separate, continuing to walk together.

Those who were close by had already begun to doubt the true strength of the two youths. Liu Hanying, as a direct witness, had confirmed that these two were unfathomable; she had misjudged them earlier.

Gan Jincheng frowned. "Where does the mystery and extraordinary nature of this place lie?" After walking for ten *li*, they encountered no more danger, but also made no special discoveries.

Jiang Ruoli said, "That senior implied it quite clearly: it requires keen spiritual perception. Newcomers are out of luck here. Most likely, it wants us to constantly use our divine perception and consciousness aura to explore the path." Then, everyone except the Newcomers did so.

"Hiss!"

After walking another two *li*, they made a discovery. The entire world seemed a little different, filled with an indescribable aura. Moreover, soon after, they heard dog barks, not from wild dogs, but very much like those kept in villages, and faintly, there were even chicken crows.

Many people were startled, seeing scenes ahead that shouldn't appear. However, the Newcomers in each team were utterly confused, because they saw and heard nothing. Those who walked the Immortal Path and Secret Sect Path, if they did not use their divine perception or consciousness aura, would only see towering ancient trees and thorny bushes ahead, with no abnormalities whatsoever.

"Is that a Near-Immortal, or a God-like being?!" As they approached, the scenery became clearer, causing some people to tremble.

Ahead, there was a thatched cottage. On a bluestone table, tea fragrance wafted, and bamboo slips were piled high. An peerless beauty was reading a bamboo book, her long hair falling, touching the slips, emitting a brilliant glow. She seemed to hear someone calling and temporarily left, riding on five-colored clouds.

"She left! The freshly brewed tea hasn't been drunk. Can we approach? Could it be the legendary immortal tea that grants enlightenment?"

"Those bamboo slips..." Some people's hearts trembled. They were excited yet apprehensive, feeling it all too dreamlike. Was this the fortune the elder hinted at? It seemed not to exist in the normal, real world.

Meanwhile, in a distant area, Xiang Yiwu was dumbfounded, because he saw a dilapidated temple where a golden cicada, burning with intense flames, was staring at him eye to eye. Ahead, a sudden cicada chirp sounded, and the burly abandoned disciple of Buddha nearly exploded. He shivered all over, staggering backward, his mouth full of blood foam.

Even further away, Li Qingyue, with her hair like a waterfall, walked like an exiled immortal, her silk sash fluttering in the wind from her slender waist. She walked along a path paved entirely with black and white stones. An eight-sided bronze lamp cast its light, illuminating her path. Soon after, she saw a palace engraved with trigram symbols standing ahead.

In another place, Cui Chong, holding a nine-colored sword, cut through thorns and brambles, finally ascending along a bluestone path, rising towards the clouds.

...

"She's back! Did she see us?"

In the distance, a group of youths watched, their hearts uneasy. What they saw was quite bizarre. Was it a real person and scenery, an illusion, or a residual image of something that had once happened here? They couldn't help but approach, moving forward involuntarily.

"Brother, did you see it?" Xiao Wu asked in secret.

"I saw it," Qin Ming nodded.

Xiao Wu's expression was grave. "It's truly strange. This doesn't seem like a spirit wandering place, yet it's so real. I even smelled the tea fragrance, and my mind felt clear. If I could take a sip, wouldn't I achieve enlightenment?"

Qin Ming nodded. "The tea fragrance is indeed very enticing, and my mind resonates with it. The key is that pile of bamboo slips; they are even more extraordinary." As they approached, more and more scenes emerged.

After the woman returned, an elderly couple also walked over, and a young child appeared. Furthermore, a young couple gradually became clear. A house with blue bricks and gray tiles also appeared beside the thatched cottage. This seemed like a family.

Immediately, the scene rapidly shifted. The elderly couple were likely the woman's parents, the young couple her elder brother and sister-in-law, and the child her nephew. In the courtyard of the blue-brick, gray-tiled house, a yellow dog wagged its tail, and old hens roamed about, very down-to-earth.

As years passed, the beautiful woman in the thatched cottage on one side remained unchanged in appearance, while everyone else had grown very old. Finally, she stood up from the bluestone table, her entire body glowing. Endless light rain covered her, the thatched cottage, and all the others.

"This is like a story: one person attains the Dao, ascends amidst glowing clouds, and even their chickens and dogs ascend to heaven..." someone murmured.

However, the final outcome was different from everyone's expectations. When the woman lifted off the ground with her family, they burned fiercely, finally turning to ashes. A faint light rain surged forth, but it also exploded and dissipated. Everyone turned to ash, simply perishing. On the spot, the thatched cottage and gray-tiled house were left only as ruins. The bamboo slips burned, leaving only a few fragments. Only the tea set remained intact, still there.

A breeze blew, lifting the ashes. Green bamboo swayed, thin mist lingered, and colorful clouds gathered and dispersed, as if narrating the difficulty of becoming a near-immortal. Even such a dazzling woman failed, and even implicated her family.

Ashes, rubble, a bluestone table, a teapot and teacups left from who knows how many years ago—a truly abnormal scene, laid out before them.

Someone couldn't help it and strode forward, then suddenly clutched his head, his consciousness aura flickering unsteadily. He simply couldn't approach the place. When he retreated and took deep breaths, he was astonished to find that he couldn't see anything. No matter how he extended his consciousness aura to perceive those scenes, it was useless.

"Did I fail? I can't get close?" he muttered to himself. Then, feeling nothing, he continued to walk forward. This time, he could walk into that area, but felt nothing, simply passing through it.

Others noticed that he seemed like a shadow, drifting past the ruins. In the real world, that was a thorny patch, and he had only touched vines and ancient trees.

"Let me try!" another person stepped forward, but also clutched his head and screamed. Afterward, someone, without moving his body, extended his consciousness aura, trying to approach the place. But it felt like being struck by lightning; his soul light was repelled, and it took him a long time to regain consciousness. He felt a chill down his spine and said, "It felt like being hit by an otherworldly heavenly light, the pain was unbearable!"

Lin Qianyi, Wang Lijie, and others successively stepped forward, all failing. Even the renowned figures here, Gan Jincheng, Jiang Ruoli, and Zhao Muyao, walked to the front of the small courtyard ruins, but ultimately retreated with pale faces.

The Pure Yang Body, named Lu Dao, was also in the team. He entered the small courtyard under immense pressure, seemingly hearing something, and then retreated, saying, "This place has no缘分 with me."

Next, Ling Yu and Xin Youdao also successfully stepped in. Many watched nervously. Both frowned successively, then retreated. Except for the Newcomers, everyone had tried once, all gaining nothing.

Luo Lianqing, the "Immortal Flower" of Feixian Academy, said, "It's fine. There must be more wondrous scenes and even more astonishing fortunes ahead. There will always be a place suitable for us." The group all nodded.

"Do you two want to try? Wu Yaozu, aren't you cultivating both paths?" Liu Hanying whispered.

"Brother, let's try too!" Xiao Wu said.

"Alright!" Qin Ming nodded.

Then, the two of them, like the others, trembled slightly and groaned when they initially approached.

"This... one cultivates both paths, but the other is just a simple Newcomer, yet they can also feel something?"

"How can you believe that? They're clearly faking it!"

Some people observed and discussed from behind. Unfortunately, at this moment, they could no longer perceive the miraculous scene. The ruined thatched cottage, bluestone table, tea set, and so on, were all invisible to them.

"I don't believe they really went in!" Zhao Muyao said. This was because Qin Ming and Xiao Wu had stepped forward again. They were only slightly hindered before smoothly entering the ruins of the small courtyard.

Xiao Yaqin said, "I think they are just putting on a show. It's impossible for them to truly step before a Near-Immortal's thatched cottage."

"Pure Yang Number Two, Calamity Aversion Number Two, quiet down," Xiao Wu said. He actually had the leisure to remind those people. Zhao Muyao and Xiao Yaqin both glared at their retreating backs. They were referred to as "Number Two"; that guy was truly outrageous.

Qin Ming and Xiao Wu heard a sigh, as if a woman was speaking, saying they were not suitable for the path here and should leave as soon as possible. The two ignored her, wandering and searching around. Then, they encountered immense pressure, as five-colored clouds surged towards them, attempting to expel them. However, the two stood firm like nails, resisting the mountainous force, refusing to budge.

Xiao Wu said, "She dissipated long ago; she can't do anything to us."

Qin Ming walked towards the bluestone table, picked up the teapot, and shook it. There was still the sound of liquid sloshing inside. Soon, Xiao Wu, resisting the immense force, also walked over.

"This tea hasn't gone bad, has it?" he muttered.

"No, it's still very fragrant!" Qin Ming said with certainty.

"Can those two really be faking it? They're quite convincing!" someone outside commented.

Wang Lijie said, "They must have memorized the location of the bluestone and are now pretending to pick up the teapot!"

Lin Qianyi said, "They're even pouring tea. Is acting like this interesting?"

Qin Ming was indeed surprised and astonished. So many years had passed, yet the tea in the pot hadn't spoiled. Tea fragrance still wafted, and it was very enticing. Unfortunately, there was very little tea. As soon as he shook it, he felt it—perhaps not even half a cup. The bluestone tabletop was dust-free, and the teacups were like new, very clean.

Qin Ming poured tea into the two cups. As expected, there was only a small amount; though it covered the bottom, the tea was probably only an inch deep. It was clear, sparkling, and faintly glowing, unlike ordinary tea. Just smelling it made one feel on the verge of enlightenment.

"I'll try it first, to see if it's bad tea," Xiao Wu said. He tasted a little, then immediately put it down. "Good tea! I'm getting drunk!" However, this kind of drunkenness was a profound intoxication; he felt as if he was on the verge of enlightenment.

Qin Ming also drank some. Instantly, his mind became clear, and he gained many insights, wanting to enter secluded cultivation right there!

"These two are addicted, getting more and more convincing!" someone whispered.

Qin Ming looked at the bamboo slips preserved on the table and was instantly shocked. He was sure he hadn't misread. He stared at the characters and patterns on the bamboo slips, in disbelief!

Xiao Wu also picked up a few bamboo slips and instantly petrified. "I'm rubbing... no, may heaven rub me! This is ancestral providence!" Although he was in an enlightened state, he was also on the verge of madness. His fingers trembled as he fumbled with the bamboo slips, immensely excited.

Qin Ming was the same. He felt the bamboo slips were as heavy as mountains. This tea and these bamboo slips were definitely a perfect combination. He closed his eyes, replayed his thoughts, then looked at the bamboo slips again, gaining even more insights. This place truly was a land of wonders!
