Chapter 50: That Day

That day, on Phoenix Mountain, it was the fourth month of the human world.

Suo Chanzhi lay curled up on the couch like a lazy Persian cat. Her jet-black hair was tied in a simple bun, fastened with a green jade hairpin, making her look exceptionally elegant and pure. Her figure was curvaceous and smooth, already carrying the fullness of a young wife.

Qing Mei knelt on the long-pile carpet before the couch, laying out Yang Can's plan to Suo Chanzhi in its entirety.

Undoubtedly, Yang Can's plan was a gamble. If it failed, they would be in a very passive position. However, it was also the most effective method to break the current stalemate.

Yu Xinglong had used Yu Chengye's death to put Yu Huanhu in a difficult position. In response, Yu Huanhu severed his own arm, returned his assets, and vowed to live in seclusion to escape the calamity. But by returning the assets, he turned the tables back on Yu Xinglong. *If you don't touch my people, you lose your prestige. If you do touch them, and the autumn harvest fails, you will still lose your prestige.*

Regarding this, Yu Xinglong truly had no better way to break the deadlock, so he presented a "scapegoat." To deal with the Suo family, use him! To handle inquiries from all sides, use him. He was being used for every purpose, his value squeezed dry.

Yang Can was unwilling to submit; he had to prove his value and solve this unsolvable problem. Under these circumstances, all conventional methods were either useless or too slow. It seemed the only option was to take a risk.

Thinking of this, Suo Chanzhi asked softly, "Does he understand that a pawn that has crossed the river is in the most perilous position? He cannot retreat, only advance. He is the most conspicuous target, the easiest to be taken out first."

Qing Mei replied earnestly, "But, he has already crossed the river!"

Suo Chanzhi was stunned. That's right, he has already crossed the river! At this point, is there any meaning in hesitating over whether he should have crossed?

Suo Chanzhi laughed at herself. "You've awoken me with a single sentence."

Qing Mei shook her head. "It wasn't my idea. I just remembered something Director Yang said."

"What did he say?"

"He said that since that day, he can only advance, not retreat."

Suo Chanzhi's enchanting eyebrows arched slightly in confusion. "Which day?"

"That day!"

Qing Mei pursed her lips, as pink and tender as a dried apricot. "That day..."

That day...

Suo Chanzhi's face suddenly flushed, as if remembering something. Then, little Qing Mei's face also turned red.

Suo Chanzhi coughed, feigning seriousness. "Alright, I agree!"

Qing Mei was surprised. "Miss, you're agreeing just like that?"

Qing Mei had privately hoped Suo Chanzhi would agree to Yang Can's plan, but her sudden and decisive agreement was still somewhat unexpected.

"Mm, I agree!" Suo Chanzhi sat up.

It was a beautiful spring day, and sunlight slanted in through the opened shoji door. Suo Chanzhi's skin looked as pure as glazed glass in the light. She looked at Qing Mei with utmost seriousness. "We have no other choice but to trust him!"

After a moment of silence, Suo Chanzhi's voice grew a little lower. "Just like that night, he had no other choice either."

Her voice became even more melancholic. "Qing Mei, tell me... am I being unfair to him?"

Qing Mei remained silent. He was doing perfectly fine as an advisor, and then suddenly, he was pulled into this life-and-death vortex by them... But what's the use of saying more now that it's done?

Suo Chanzhi sighed. "You must take good care of..."

She stopped and gave a bitter smile. "No, you can't take care of him. On the surface, you two are still a pair of sworn enemies."

"We're not anymore," Qing Mei quickly explained upon hearing this. "Miss, now everyone in Feng'an Village thinks that I... have a secret relationship with him."

"Oh?" Suo Chanzhi looked at Qing Mei, her gaze gradually becoming peculiar.

Qing Mei's face turned red again under her scrutiny. "But I don't, I really don't, I swear!" Qing Mei raised her hand, looking righteous. *Anyway, I haven't slept with him, so it doesn't count.*

The two piercing gazes that had been putting so much pressure on Qing Mei finally retracted.

"Forget it. Whether you have or not, it's bound to happen sooner or later. You were originally my dowry maid anyway. So... you'll have to take good care of him for me."

"Oh..." Little Qing Mei answered in a daze.

*By the miss's logic, if I round it up, doesn't that make him my man?*

*Ugh! What "rounding up," it sounds like "dismemberment by five horses," so creepy. Whether it's rounding up or down, it should be counted as "five in"!*

Yang Can's curved-plow was finally finished.

Before this, the only plows in this world were straight-beamed. Straight-beamed plows were not very flexible when turning around at the end of a furrow, were very laborious to operate, and had poor efficiency. Their defects were especially obvious in small, complex plots of land.

The curved-plow, created with Yang Can's ideas and forged by Blacksmith Li, perfectly solved these problems. It was not only easy to maneuver, but could also freely adjust the depth of the plowing. Moreover, it was more ergonomic to use. Using it allowed the plowman to stand upright to operate, instead of having to bend over as before. Even a single person with a single ox could complete the entire process, greatly reducing the use of manpower and animal power.

Today, they were going to officially unveil this new plow in the fields. Many tenant farmers, villagers, and retainers had rushed over upon hearing the news. They had used farm tools their whole lives and had never imagined they could be improved. They all wanted to know if this thing was really better than the plows they used now.

Blacksmith Li's little apprentices carried the curved-plow and placed it in the field as if it were a treasure. An old, experienced farmer was called to test it. He had a face full of wrinkles, was stripped to the waist, and his dark skin was as tough as cast iron. He was a tenant farmer of Feng'an Village, tilling the Yu family's land.

As soon as he saw the tenant leader, Wang Fugui, he complained with a bitter face. "Tenant Leader Wang, the ox and plow from the landlord today should have been used by my family. Now you've called this old man to test the new plow, and this delay will cost me half a day's work!"

Wang Fugui said impatiently, "Alright, alright, enough with the nonsense. You were asked to test the plow because everyone agrees you're a good farmer. Don't worry, since we're using your land for the test and asking you to do it, we'll naturally compensate you. One day, how about one day? We'll let your family use the ox and plow for an extra day."

The old man was overjoyed, and with a grin full of yellow teeth, he bowed deeply to Wang Fugui. "Thank you, Tenant Leader Wang, thank you!"

"Alright, alright, hurry up and test the plow."

"Alright, alright, this old man is going."

The old man happily went down into the field. He and his son unhitched the old plow from the ox, then led the ox over. After he finished preparing, just as he was about to plow with his son as usual, Yang Can suddenly said, "No, use this plow alone."

"Eh?"

The old man was a bit confused. *Could this even work?* But he knew that Director Yang was a great figure whom even the village lord treated with respect. Even if the man was giving blind commands, he didn't dare to disobey. The old man thought to himself, *I'll just put all my strength into it today and try to plow the field well. Otherwise, if this great lord gets angry in his embarrassment, I'll be the one to suffer.*

Many villagers crowded at the edge of the field, watching the experiment. The old man held the plow and looked at Tenant Leader Wang Fugui with trepidation. Wang Fugui nodded, and only then did the old man cautiously shout, "Gee!"

The commands for guiding an ox are roughly the same as for a horse, but an ox's reaction is much slower. So when giving commands like "Gee," "Haw," "Whoa," or "Get up," the voice should be drawn out a bit.

Hearing the command, the ox tensed the plow rope and moved forward. Most of the people present were farmers who worked the land. After just a few glances, they noticed that this plow seemed quite different. The old man holding the plow felt it most acutely. This time, he could not only straighten his back, but he also didn't need his son to lead the way in front. Wherever the plow passed, the soil parted with a rumble, as if plowing open a wave of mud. It felt not only much easier than usual, but the soil crumbling effect was also better.

The old man was both surprised and delighted. The villagers at the edge of the field were even more excited and clamorous. Blacksmith Li ran over excitedly and urged, "Don't stop, don't stop, keep going. Plow this furrow and then turn around to try."

"Alright, alright," the old man agreed, continuing to drive the ox forward. The farmers couldn't hold back and ran into the field, walking alongside him.

Peng Jin, the field supervisor, was dumbfounded. "It's actually feasible, it's actually effective."

This Supervisor Peng and Lai Gulun had been following Yang Can every day, but later they had grown lazy and just sat under a tree drinking tea and chatting at the blacksmith's shop. Today was the first time Peng Jin had truly looked at this curved-plow.

He watched as the plow reached the end of a furrow, turned around easily, and came back this way. When the plow got close, many villagers surrounded it at once. They touched it here and there, all extremely excited.

The old man abandoned the plow and stumbled over, shouting excitedly, "Tenant Leader, Tenant Leader, this plow works, it really works!" He was already babbling incoherently. A job that originally required two or three people could now be done with at least one person saved. Not only that, it also saved animal power. It used to take three days to plow one *mu*, but now it could basically be done in one day. This was a divine tool, a true divine tool!

The same plot of land, the labor time shortened from three days to one! The required manpower reduced from two or three to one, and animal power was also saved... How much manpower, material resources, and time would be saved? The immense economic value of this was the most intuitive thing for these villagers.

Yang Can recalled some information he knew and smiled. "This plow saves more than just manpower and material resources. Using this kind of plow, the effects of deep plowing and soil crumbling are better, and the yield will also increase. I don't dare to say much, but an increase of ten to twenty percent in yield is possible."

What?

Yang Can's words were like throwing a ladle of cold water into a boiling pot of dumplings. The scene fell into a dead silence. A moment later, the "water" boiled even more fiercely.

The old man testing the plow fell to his knees with a thud. With tears in his eyes, he shouted, "Divine tool, this is a divine tool! Director, you are a god!"

The effects Yang Can described were actually somewhat conservative, but in the ears of these farmers, it was already an incredible miracle. The villagers were in an uproar. Lai Gulun, Peng Jin, and Wang Fugui's eyes sparkled with greed when they heard the news.
