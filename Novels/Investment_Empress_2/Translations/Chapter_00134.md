# Chapter 134: Li Mo: "Are You Selling the Blood Phoenix Essence?"

"I was once a Profound Master of the Seventh Realm."

Han Zhen stood with his hands behind his back, speaking indifferently.

A Profound Master was almost the pinnacle of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Any faction without a Profound Master to stand guard could not be called transcendent.

They need not bow to emperors and could enjoy the treatment of princes just by having their names recorded in the imperial court.

His majestic voice echoed within the palace.

"Profound Master?"

Li Mo was confused.

Ying Bing remained as cold and detached as ever.

For a moment, the palace was silent—so silent it became awkward.

Han Zhen: "..."

The reactions of these two young people were not what he had expected.

There was no terror, no shock, no ecstasy. Nothing.

Then again...

The Clear Abyss Sect had declined to this extent.

The strongest person they knew, Shangcang Wencang, was merely at the Fifth Realm, the Outer Scenery.

"In the Eastern Wilderness Domain, you are nothing but frogs at the bottom of a well."

Han Zhen patiently straightened his chest slightly.

"When you reach the Fourth Realm, the Inner Scenery, you will realize that seeing me is like a mayfly seeing the vast blue sky."

His words carried unparalleled confidence and spirit.

Then, the atmosphere fell flat again.

Ying Bing: "..."

Li Mo: "Hmm..."

To be honest.

Li Mo felt that Han Zhen wasn't very good at painting grand visions. He was too honest, not professional at all.

He had a few suggestions, but he wasn't sure if he should say them...

Han Zhen narrowed his eyes at the unmoved duo and praised them:

"You two indeed have a calm temperament, the sign of one who will achieve great things."

"Very well, I shall tell you the truth directly."

"I am no ordinary Profound Master. Thousands of years ago, I was the Grand Tutor of the Great Shang Dynasty, dominating the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands for millennia."

"If you have my guidance, you will surely enter the Seventh Realm in the future."

"Divine arts, peerless techniques, rare treasures—many divine items you haven't even seen in the Clear Abyss Sect will be within your reach."

His voice shook the air, his words like a seductive hand, carrying immense temptation.

Han Zhen believed he was showing great sincerity.

Over the thousands of years, he had never wasted so much breath and effort on anyone.

*Whoosh—*

The pale golden skeleton of the Profound Master suddenly stood up.

A bewitching red light pulsed faintly at its chest. With each beat, blood-colored patterns spread along the bones, forming intricate runes.

A powerful and terrifying aura swept over them.

This was both a display of strength and a threat.

"You've actually degraded the Blood Phoenix Essence to such a state."

Ying Bing frowned slightly.

"...?"

Han Zhen's eyelids twitched, and a dangerous glint appeared in his eyes.

"Uh."

Li Mo thought for a moment and asked:

"Is the scheme you mentioned, by any chance, to overthrow the Great Yu and restore the Great Shang?"

Han Zhen seemed surprised, but he didn't deny it.

Li Mo coughed lightly and continued:

"Then how about this? I have some wealth. Why don't you sell the Blood Phoenix Essence to me?"

"After that, we go our separate ways. How about it?"

"What do you think?"

Han Zhen was so angry he almost laughed, his expression turning completely gloomy.

Behind him, the bronze divine tree faintly appeared.

Knowing so many secrets, yet wanting to act as if nothing happened without joining his cause?

"Wild horses are hard to tame. When I was young, I was just as unruly as you."

"Then let you experience firsthand what... despair is!"

As he spoke, his body gradually melted, turning into blood.

---

The ground began to bleed, turning the palace into a river of blood. Under the illumination of the divine tree, it began to boil.

It was far stronger than any Divine Observer Realm expert they had ever seen.

The blood river surged and roared toward them.

A radiant glow flowed, and sword qi like rain froze it solid.

"You actually possess the Radiant Phoenix Qi, no wonder..."

Han Zhen was shocked, but his desire grew even stronger.

Li Mo pulled out a hammer, interrupting the speech.

He directly pulled out a hammer and swung it down, shattering the frozen blood river.

He had been observing the movements of the blood river, trying to find Han Zhen's true body within it, and then smash it with eighty hammer strikes.

*Rumble, rumble, rumble—*

Sword qi surged, the wind from the hammer howled, and the blood river churned.

For a time, the palace buzzed incessantly.

Han Zhen grew more and more alarmed as he fought.

He realized that Ying Bing and Li Mo were both far stronger than he had imagined!

One was surrounded by a flowing radiance, bone-chilling cold, with逆天 sword cultivation.

The other possessed immense strength, and destructive power even surpassing the former.

He had to admit.

Even if these two separated and fought him one-on-one, he might not necessarily have the chance to win.

Facing two at once, even with his vast accumulation and the blood river he had gathered, defeat was only a matter of time.

"Being able to force me to this extent, you two can be called heroes."

"But... this is my洞天 (Cave Heaven)!"

*Boom—*

The red array patterns on the ground lit up rapidly, absorbing the blood.

The thick scent of blood flowed through the array, pouring back into the Blood Phoenix Essence in the skeleton's heart, making it increasingly miraculous.

It even grew flesh and meridians again, quickly forming a human body. The face resembled the youth in red clothes, but older—it was Han Zhen's middle-aged appearance.

The middle-aged Han Zhen stood shoulder to shoulder with the young Han Zhen, their auras connecting.

A trace of a Profound Master's pressure filled every corner of the world!

*Splash—*

The blood river separated, splitting the battlefield.

"Huh?"

After being separated, Ying Bing looked toward Li Mo's direction but couldn't see the youth.

"The opportunity of the Clear Abyss Sect is actually the Radiant Phoenix Qi."

Above, the middle-aged Han Zhen's heart burned with excitement. This was a treasure.

If he combined it with the Blood Phoenix Essence in his hand, when he returned to his peak, he might be able to go a step further and reach the Eighth Realm!

Regardless of whether Ying Bing submitted or not, he had to get his hands on this Radiant Phoenix Qi!

"The might of a Profound Master, why aren't you kneeling?"

*Thump, thump—*

The Blood Phoenix Essence, refined from blood, pulsed, each beat powerful and vigorous.

It also made the pressure of the Profound Master Realm grow stronger wave after wave.

If it absorbed enough living essence, truly reviving this Profound Master skeleton wasn't impossible.

However.

The girl opposite him said something he couldn't understand even if his brain exploded:

"You are weaker than last time."

Han Zhen was furious.

Because he found the girl's gaze cold and disdainful.

It was like looking at a piece of trash barely holding on.

Just as he attacked in anger, planning to use a trace of Profound Master power to completely suppress Ying Bing...

*Thump—*

The Blood Phoenix Essence beat violently again.

This time, it broke free from Han Zhen's control.

"No!"

Han Zhen's eyes split wide with rage.

But he could do nothing, only watch helplessly.

The treasure that had kept him alive for thousands of years, the foundation for his comeback, turned into a blood-colored phoenix shadow. Like a swallow returning to its nest, it flew into Ying Bing's forehead.

And slowly began to burn.

"The Blood Phoenix Essence is not used that way."

Ying Bing was enveloped in burning phoenix feathers. Her beautiful eyes were still so calm, but because of the surging divine light, she appeared noble and domineering.
