# Chapter 27: Spiritual Farmer Liu Yun

Li Yizhen's pale face instantly flushed red at a visible speed, like a boiled lobster.

"Lan Lan!" Li Yizhen cried out, pouncing straight onto Lan Lan.

The other female cultivators in the neighboring spirit fields burst into laughter.

In truth, they weren't genuinely trying to set Li Yizhen and Ding Rui up; Li Yizhen had never even said she liked Ding Rui.

However, in their eyes, Ding Rui was a bit simple-minded, seemingly clueless about romantic matters, while Li Yizhen did pay him some attention. So, they often teased her, seeing it as a unique form of amusement in their intense, busy, and monotonous life in the spirit fields.

Moreover, they knew that the speakers were not serious, and neither were the listeners.

Currently, these female cultivators were secretly watching Ding Rui, seeing him stare blankly at Li Yizhen, who was hugging Lan Lan, covering her mouth, and blushing fiercely. He looked utterly bewildered, as if he hadn't understood a single thing.

Qing Yu also couldn't help but chuckle. Glancing at the sky, she interrupted Li Yizhen and Lan Lan. "Alright, it's getting late. Afternoon work is about to begin. Don't mess around here; get ready. Junior Brother Ding Rui, you should head back early too."

Ding Rui nodded obediently.

Returning to Spirit Field 377, Ding Rui looked at the Green Bee Knight, still silent and motionless, then shifted his gaze to the small bag of valley flower seeds in his hand.

"I'll be working overtime tomorrow, so I'll plant these tonight!"

He bent down and began to work, selecting a relatively fertile plot of land near the entrance.

Valley flowers planted in ordinary soil naturally wouldn't thrive, but Ding Rui only needed them to live and then bloom.

The moon unknowingly revealed itself, casting silver light over the land, illuminating the busy figure in Spirit Field 377.

The night gradually passed.

Although Ding Rui had already planted the valley flowers, ready for the Green Bee Knight's successful awakening of intelligence, a good half month later, the Green Bee Knight still hadn't achieved it.

However, after asking Mi and learning that this was normal—some bee cultivators' awakenings could even take several years—and that Mi had already prepared enough food for the Green Bee Knight, Ding Rui stopped worrying excessively.

As long as he was sure the Green Bee Knight was still alive, that was enough.

The valley flower seeds he planted at the entrance had already sprouted and were growing quite robustly.

After all, he was destined to become a spiritual farmer, and under Ding Rui's care, these valley flowers would face practically no issues.

So, even before Liu Yun returned, several outer sect disciples led people to Spirit Field 377 to take over Liu Yun's previous work.

A total of three people arrived: one cultivator practicing the *Rain and Dew Art*, one practicing the *Condensing Yang Art*, and one practicing the *Earth Qi Art*.

After Ding Rui and Liu Yun had swapped the weeding and rain-summoning duties, Ding Rui alone took charge of all insect extermination and weeding. This was necessary for his merged skills, and he even often felt the daily quantity wasn't enough, so he worked overtime at a low price, naturally not relinquishing these tasks to anyone else.

Now that Liu Yun had left, and the sect knew Ding Rui had mastered the *Rain and Dew Art*, they naturally assigned half of the rain-summoning work to him as well.

Adding Wu Ang and Le You, Spirit Field 377 now only needed one *Rain and Dew Art* cultivator, one *Earth Qi Art* cultivator, and one *Condensing Yang Art* cultivator.

The total number of people suddenly increased to six.

And Ding Rui immediately became the undisputed mainstay of Spirit Field 377!

After the outer sect disciples dropped off the three new cultivators, the three cultivators immediately rushed forward to greet Ding Rui, Wu Ang, and Le You.

"Senior Brother Ding, do you still remember me? I once invited you to our spirit field to exterminate insects!"

"Senior Brother Ding, you've also been to our spirit field, 333, do you remember? You said you wanted to run away when you saw that number."

"Haha, Senior Brother Ding, I'm from 230. Please take good care of me in the future."
