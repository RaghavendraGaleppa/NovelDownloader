# Chapter 2: Forced to Take the Blame

The courtyard fell into stunned silence. While tales of finding treasures after falling off cliffs were common in stories and folktales, no one had actually encountered such fortune in real life.

Yet as they observed Lin Fan's newfound aura and charisma, something about him did seem subtly different now.

"I paid respects to my master's remains at the cliffside and inherited his legacy," Lin Fan continued his grand speech. "I vowed to cultivate diligently and bring glory to the Primordial Tyrant Blade lineage."

Most listeners remained skeptical. The story sounded too fantastical, and with only Lin Fan's word as proof, many suspected he might be spinning tales.

Steward Lin, in particular, refused to believe a single word. In his fifty years of life, he'd never heard of anyone actually obtaining such fortuitous encounters—such stories belonged firmly in the realm of fantasy!

As he pondered, the steward grew convinced this matter must be connected to Lin Fan. Remembering the tight deadline the family elders had set for solving the theft case, and with a discreet glance at the chest of silver, he ordered his subordinates:

"Confiscate these stolen goods for now and detain Lin Fan until we complete our investigation."

Lin Fan immediately protested, "Steward Lin, I respect you as an elder, but you can't falsely accuse me. If you take these away, even if I'm cleared later, I doubt they'll return intact."

"You insolent brat!" Steward Lin stepped forward angrily. "The family head tasked me with investigating this theft—everyone must cooperate. Your refusal proves you're hiding something; if you're hiding something, you're the prime suspect; and if you're the prime suspect, you're likely the thief! Come with me to the disciplinary hall!"

His words carried a surface logic that sounded almost convincing.

As Steward Lin reached out with his calloused hands, the surrounding clansmen quickly scattered. But tonight was destined for twists—Lin Fan stood his ground and met the steward's palms with his own.

*Boom!*

A dull impact echoed as both men staggered back. The flagstones beneath Lin Fan's feet cracked like spiderwebs, yet the youth himself remained unharmed and composed.

"Impossible!" Steward Lin's face twisted in disbelief. "Tempered organs, qi circulating internally! You've reached the peak of Visceral Training and are approaching Transformation mastery?"

Gasps erupted through the courtyard.

Among the crowd, Lin Shan's interest piqued. In this world, martial artists were divided into Precelestial and Postcelestial realms.

Precelestial masters were exceedingly rare—rumor had it only the Great Elder of the Lin family had reached that realm, making the Lins one of the foremost noble clans in Qinghe County.

Postcelestial practitioners progressed through three stages: Qi Exchange, Visceral Training, and Transformation—commonly known as third-rate, second-rate, and first-rate masters.

As the saying went: "Scholars thrive in poverty, warriors in wealth." Martial cultivation demanded tremendous resources in nutrition and finances—only wealthy families could afford it.

Training without proper nourishment would only exhaust one's vitality, leading to premature death.

Even among noble houses, starting martial training at age eight with regular medicinal meals and pills, it typically took at least ten years just to reach Qi Exchange—the first Postcelestial stage.

For someone like Lin Fan to achieve Visceral Training (second-rate mastery) by sixteen was virtually unheard of—even among aristocratic families' privileged heirs!

In all of Qinghe County, this was unprecedented!

Now many clansmen began wondering if Lin Fan truly might have inherited a peerless master's legacy.

"Could the legendary protagonist hiding his strength be right beside me?" Lin Shan mused. Did everyone with 'Fan' in their name get protagonist-level fortune?

Not just Lin Shan—the entire crowd now regarded the youth who'd just faced Steward Lin with newfound awe.

Even Steward Lin himself was only a second-rate master. Younger generation members like Lin Shan and Lin Shu hadn't even reached Qi Exchange yet—technically not even ranked as martial artists.

A second-rate warrior like Lin Fan could already make a name for himself in the wider martial world!

"Enough!"

A stern-faced middle-aged man emerged from the inner courtyard—Lin Zhenyue, current head of the Lin family and a renowned first-rate master in Qinghe County.

Even the county magistrate treated him as an equal.

After glancing at the silver notes and Lin Fan, he declared, "A clansman's personal fortune remains his own—the family won't confiscate it. However, regarding the stolen 'Spring River Ducks' painting, you do bear some suspicion."

Pointing at Steward Lin and several managers, he ordered, "Tomorrow, search all pawnshops, auction houses, even black markets for traces of the painting."

With a flick of his sleeve, he turned to leave, adding, "Lin Fan, come with me. Everyone else, disperse."

Though Steward Lin's pride smarted, he had no choice but to comply.

Late into the night, the crowd dispersed in small groups, buzzing about Lin Fan's Visceral Training breakthrough.

Carrying his meager belongings back to his small room, Lin Shan felt half his worries lift. Thanks to Lin Fan's dramatic intervention and forced scapegoating, most of the family's attention had been diverted.

Had they investigated deeper, who knew what might have been uncovered.

Sitting on his bed, Lin Shan reflected on how his peer Lin Fan had already reached Visceral Training as a second-rate master, while he hadn't even crossed the first threshold of Qi Exchange.

---

"Could Lin Fan actually be the transmigrator here?" The thought startled Lin Shan himself.

Despite his envy, he couldn't neglect daily cultivation. Producing today's allotted "Qi Gathering Pills"—common supplements helping unranked martial artists accumulate qi—Lin Shan prepared for his routine.

Lin family outer courtyard disciples received one bottle monthly (ten pills), with modest effects.

Just as he was about to swallow a pill, the translucent interface from earlier reappeared before his eyes:
