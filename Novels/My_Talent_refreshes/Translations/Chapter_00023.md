# Chapter 23: The First Magical Duel  

Chu Ning had been traveling with the Wind Riding Technique for a while when he began to feel the inconvenience of carrying the wooden sword in his hand.  

Without channeling spiritual energy into it, the sword was too heavy and somewhat hindered his movement. But infusing it with energy would drain his reserves.  

He had previously tested his limits—after casting the Verdant Wood Spring Technique ten times in succession, his spiritual energy would be nearly depleted by the time he returned to his residence.  

For the past few days, he had refrained from consuming any Replenishment Pills to conserve them. But today, without one, his energy wouldn’t be enough to sustain him.  

"Should I just walk the last stretch?"  

After a moment’s hesitation, Chu Ning shook his head and found a secluded spot. He took out a Replenishment Pill from his pouch and swallowed it.  

His cautious nature made him unwilling to linger too long outside the sect or the market.  

The pill could restore his energy even without meditation, though the process would be slower. Meditating while refining the pill’s energy, however, would yield faster and better results.  

This was how he had recovered his energy the first time at Old Man Sun’s place.  

A quarter of an hour later, his spiritual energy was fully restored. Chu Ning stood up and prepared to continue his journey.  

As he stepped back onto the main path, he paused. In the distance, a figure was approaching—someone not dressed in the robes of a Qingxi Sect disciple.  

"Why would an outsider be on this road leading to the Qingxi Sect?"  

The thought flashed through his mind, and his entire body tensed with vigilance.  

At that moment, the bearded cultivator opposite him caught sight of Chu Ning, and a flicker of delight crossed his face.  

"Something’s wrong!"  

Though the expression vanished in an instant, Chu Ning, who had been closely observing, noticed it.  

Keeping his face impassive, he discreetly gripped a talisman in his hand. Simultaneously, he swiftly channeled his energy to activate the Vine Armor Technique.  

With just that glance, Chu Ning had confirmed that the man was also at the fourth level of Qi Refinement—just like him. He couldn’t afford to be careless.  

The bearded man sensed Chu Ning’s energy fluctuations, his eyes briefly registering surprise before shifting to mockery.  

With a hand seal, just as the Vine Armor Technique enveloped Chu Ning, a sharp, metallic gleam shot from the bearded man’s hand—a Gold Sword Technique, the most offensive of the five elemental spells.  

"A full-force Gold Sword Technique from a fourth-level Qi Refinement cultivator—consider yourself honored..."  

A smug expression appeared on the bearded man’s face, but in the next instant, it vanished.  

He watched in disbelief as Chu Ning’s Vine Armor Technique, though trembling under the assault, stubbornly held, blocking his attack.  

"How is this possible? You… you’re not at the second level of Qi Refinement."  

The realization dawned on him, and his expression darkened.  

At the same time, another layer of protective energy enveloped Chu Ning, while his hands rapidly formed another hand seal.  

"A talisman?"  

A flash of greed crossed the bearded man’s eyes. With a cold laugh, he unleashed another Gold Sword Technique, aiming straight for Chu Ning.  

Though not instantaneous, his spellcasting was remarkably fast—a sign of long practice.  

**Boom!**  

The Gold Sword Technique struck the barrier formed by the Protective Talisman, sending a deafening roar into Chu Ning’s ears.  

Yet, the talisman’s defensive power proved formidable—the barrier remained intact.  

The bearded man’s confidence wavered. With another hand seal, he launched yet another Gold Sword Technique.  

As the golden light surged toward Chu Ning, he flicked his wrist, sending the wooden sword—previously set aside—flying toward his opponent using the Object Control Technique.  

The bearded man stared at the dark, oversized "flying sword" lumbering toward him. Though puzzled by its sluggish speed, he didn’t dare take the hit.  

He sidestepped, leaping a full zhang (about 3.3 meters) to evade.  

**Thud!**  

The wooden sword abruptly dropped from the air.  

The bearded man blinked in surprise, glancing at Chu Ning, wondering if his Gold Sword Technique had already killed him.  

Instead, he saw Chu Ning forming yet another hand seal.  

Instantly, four Ironvine Tendrils erupted from the ground on either side of the bearded man, coiling toward him.  

He tried to dodge, but having just evaded the wooden sword, his movements were constrained.  

Two of the vines wrapped around his legs, halting his momentum mid-leap.  

The other two swiftly followed, binding him tightly.  

**Boom!**  

The Gold Sword Technique struck Chu Ning’s protective barrier again.  

After enduring two consecutive attacks, the barrier shattered. The remaining sliver of golden energy was deflected by the Vine Armor Technique.  

The bearded man’s eyes widened—not in triumph, but in horror.  

Chu Ning was already activating another talisman.  

"How does a mere young laborer disciple have so many talismans?!"  

The thought flashed through his mind, but he would never get an answer.  

A familiar golden gleam—even faster than his own Gold Sword Technique—streaked toward him.  

"Gold Sword Talisman!"  

Those were his last words.  

The golden light pierced his chest, and he collapsed backward, his body grotesquely suspended by the unyielding vines.  

**Huff…**  

Chu Ning exhaled slowly but remained on guard.  

With another hand seal, he activated the secondary effect of the Thorn Technique. The four vines constricted, their thorns drawing blood from the bearded man’s lifeless body.  

At the same time, the fallen wooden sword rose again and slammed into the man’s head with brutal force.  

Only when neither the vines nor the sword met any resistance did Chu Ning finally relax.  

He approached cautiously, still gripping a Protective Talisman and a Gold Sword Talisman, stopping a zhang away.  

After a brief pause, confirming the man was truly dead—his body now mangled beyond recognition—Chu Ning dispelled the vines.  

His caution wasn’t unwarranted. This was his first duel with another cultivator, and he had no idea what tricks the man might have had up his sleeve.  

Next, he searched the corpse.  

The man clearly hadn’t been wealthy. After a thorough inspection, Chu Ning only found:  

- One low-grade spirit stone  
- One low-grade Swift Step Talisman  
- Two small manuals  
- A tiny jade box  

Without examining the contents, Chu Ning ensured nothing else was hidden before incinerating the body with two Fireball Techniques.  

Then, without delay, he departed.  

The rest of the journey passed without incident. Only when he finally returned to his courtyard did he allow himself a long, relieved sigh.
