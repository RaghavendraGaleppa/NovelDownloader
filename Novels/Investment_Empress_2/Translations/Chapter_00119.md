# Chapter 119: Is Old Qian Also a Master? Arrival at Dongli Village

**Name:** Yin Huacheng
**Age:** 38
**Bone Structure:** Hundred Beast Blood Body (Incomplete)
**Realm:** Five Apertures of Divine Observation.
**Fate:** Blue-Grey
**Evaluation:** Recruiter for the Hundred Beast Hall, a branch of the Demon Summoning Sect. The Hundred Beast Blood Training is neither righteous nor evil; it becomes righteous if used rightly and evil if used wrongly. This person has allowed beastly nature to enter his body, focusing solely on strengthening the physique while neglecting the spirit. He has strayed onto a crooked path, creating countless sins of slaughter.
**Recent Encounters:** Covets the Host's inheritance and desires to kill him to obtain it. Intends to enter the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm to assist Han Zhen, hoping the other party will help purify his body.

If Li Mo hadn't looked, he wouldn't have known.
The moment he did, he almost rang the bell in alarm.
The Demon Summoning Sect again?
Suddenly, many thoughts flashed through his mind.
He thought of the anomaly on Wang Hu, the black-clothed men at the Moon Watching Cliff.
He also thought of the monster below the Divine Peak Cave.
Is it all the same person?
And Han Zhen... wasn't that the person the Ice Cube told him to pay attention to?
If the son is like this, then what about the father...

**Name:** Yin Huaxuan
**Age:** 70
**Bone Structure:** Hundred Beast Blood Body
**Realm:** Eightfold Internal Scene Heaven
**Fate:** Blue with a hint of Purple
**Evaluation:** Protector of the Hundred Beast Hall of the Demon Summoning Sect. About to condense the spirit of a hundred beasts to transform into a Flood Dragon body. Has been lurking in the Clear Abyss Sect for over fifty years. Deeply scheming and steady in temperament.
**Recent Encounters:** Intends to use his identity as a Clear Abyss Sect Elder to complete the Demon Summoning Sect's scheme.

Little Li leaned back slightly.
Good lord.
This isn't even a case of defection; he was a member of the Demon Summoning Sect from the very beginning.
Fifty years.
Even Chen Yongren would have to offer him a cup of tea.
Watching the other party return to the carriage, Little Li opened his mouth.
"Cough, Yin Huacheng's character is a bit extreme, but Elder Yin is actually a decent person."
Seeing that Li Mo kept looking at the father and son, Qian Bufan spoke up beside him.
Xue Jing also said softly, "His Beast Peak has supplied the sect with many materials."
Li Mo: "..."
He looked around and cleared his throat.
"Elders, please get in the carriage to talk."
Yin Huacheng was manageable.
But for Yin Huaxuan to have survived safely in the Clear Abyss Sect for over fifty years, he surely had some backup plans.
An Eighth Stage Internal Scene expert was not something he could handle at the moment.
It was most appropriate to let trusted elders know first.
"Being so mysterious, what is it?"
Qian Bufan and Xue Jing got into the carriage.
Under normal circumstances, if a disciple just opened their mouth to say they had something to discuss with the elders, they certainly wouldn't get this kind of treatment.
"Elders, what I am about to say, even if you are surprised, please do not make a scene."
Li Mo looked at the Sect Leader's carriage. The material was special, preventing anyone from listening in, so he finally spoke.
"What kind of trouble are you causing this time, kid?"
Xue Jing was confused.
The convoy hadn't even left the Clear Abyss Sect yet. Whatever needed to be done so cautiously within the sect?
However, Li Mo's next sentence froze the confusion on his face.
"Yin Huacheng also has the aura of the Demon Summoning Sect."
The carriage fell instantly silent.
They hadn't expected Li Mo to drop such a bombshell right from the start.
Ying Bing's eyes moved slightly, her eyelids lowered as if in thought.
Xue Jing and Qian Bufan immediately turned solemn.
"This is not a matter for jokes."
Qian Bufan said sternly.
If Yin Huacheng had a problem, then what about Yin Huaxuan?
This involved not just a true disciple, but a Peak-Protector Elder.
"Xiao Mo, are you certain?"
Xue Jing considered himself a genuine Internal Scene expert, and his perception was far stronger than that of the Internal Breath realm.
But what made him uncertain was that Li Mo had a precedent: during the sect trial, he had exposed Wang Hu.
"I have a method that might prove it."
"But if this turns out to be true..."
Li Mo said, looking at the two elders with a probing gaze.
"Tell us your method first."
"If it truly works, you don't need to worry about the rest."
Qian Bufan crossed his hands behind his back and said indifferently.
Li Mo: "!"
He is so cool.
Is Old Qian actually a master?

"If we enter the secret realm, I'd like to see if there's anyone left from the Clear Abyss to jump around."
Yin Huacheng's pupils changed several times, sometimes like a snake, sometimes like a hawk, and sometimes like a bird.
"Get in."
A voice came from inside the carriage pulled by six exotic beasts, resembling a small palace.
He quickly suppressed his killing intent and boarded the carriage.
The interior of the carriage was extremely luxurious. A censer diffused a scent that calmed the mind. There were bookshelves inside, along with various paintings depicting scenes like riding the clouds or flood dragons diving into the abyss.
The clean-shaven Yin Huaxuan was painting expressionlessly.
The carriage began to move slowly.
Yin Huaxuan remained focused on his painting, and Yin Huacheng dared not speak first.
After about half an hour, he slowly lifted his brush.
A new painting of a flood dragon appeared on the paper, but like the others in the carriage, it lacked eyes.
"Father's painting skills are becoming more exquisite. I'm afraid even the Ruyi Peak can't find a better painter than you," Yin Huacheng said softly.
"Do you know why I have painted flood dragons for twenty years?" Yin Huaxuan asked.
But before Yin Huacheng could answer, he spoke again:
"The Hundred Beast Blood Training is merely a superior martial art. As long as you融 (fuse/merge) a hundred forms, it can be considered successful."
"Father, I know..."
"You know nothing."
Yin Huaxuan's expression grew colder:
"融百兽形 (Fusing the forms of a hundred beasts) is to transform into a flood dragon; transforming into a flood dragon is to observe the dragon, to transform into the true dragon's divine form."
"Look at your beastly appearance. Do you deserve it?"
Yin Huacheng was scolded until his face turned pale and then green.
"When we reach Qinghe County, I will ask Master Han to purify your body."
"You cannot touch Ying Bing. That girl is someone Master Han has specifically mentioned."
"Get out."
"Yes."
Yin Huacheng left with a pale face.
The breeze brushed his face as he rode on his horse, his mind churning with various thoughts.
He couldn't touch Ying Bing?
However, his father didn't say he couldn't touch Li Mo...
He had placed a bounty on the Yulou Building before, but the Laughing Maitreya was killed by Ying Bing before he could collect, costing him the deposit.
At that time, Qinghe County would be a chaotic mix of heroes and villains. If Li Mo died at the hands of assassins, it would seem quite reasonable?

......

For the past few days, Little Li had been immersed in monotonous training. Occasionally, he would drink tea with the Ice Cube, practice swordsmanship, and eat hot pot.
During this process, he gained a slightly better understanding of Ying Bing's two layers of Internal Breath.
The Ice Cube's physique allows her to have two layers of Internal Breath and condense two Xuan Dans.
What about himself?
Li Mo still only has a preliminary understanding of his own physique.
If the Xuan Dan is condensed well, the gap will be even more obvious in the future Divine Observation realm.
Therefore, during this period, in his spare time, he would also flip through other cultivation techniques.
The convoy of the Clear Abyss Sect traveled unimpeded, with the worst horses pulling the carriages being thousand-mile steeds.
Thus, several days later, they had already arrived at Dongli Village, a hundred miles away from Qinghe County.
This place belongs to the Burning Jade Forest, as they are considered half hosts.
Although the Burning Jade Forest is not the leader of Ziyang Prefecture, its Forest Lord has a distinguished status, so many people from all sides come here to stay.

......

*Crackle, pop—*
The light rain of June fell between the pavilions and towers of Dongli Village, making them indistinct in the misty rain.
The Burning Jade Forest said it welcomes heroes from all over the world to gather.
In reality, wandering martial artists with no background and no real ability couldn't enter at all.
But that didn't stop them from gathering nearby to inquire about news and join the excitement.
"Is that the current chief of the Burning Jade Valley? Why does he always look at people with his nose?"
"Is there a possibility that he slept wrong last night and got a stiff neck?"
"Don't talk nonsense. He seems to have broken through to the Divine Observation realm recently. How could a Divine Observation expert get a stiff neck?"
As the wandering martial artists were whispering to each other...
A team of carriages and horses came down the main road.
They turned their gazes toward it.
"The people from the Clear Abyss Sect have arrived."
