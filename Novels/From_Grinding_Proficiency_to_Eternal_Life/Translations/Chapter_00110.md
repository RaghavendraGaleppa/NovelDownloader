# Chapter 110: The Incense Fire Sect

Yan Yuwei gritted her teeth so hard they nearly shattered, her face filled with envy.

"If it were any other sect, even a Blood Transformation expert might not possess a top-grade sharp weapon. He's merely a Three-Refining Martial Master; where does he get the qualification to wield a treasure weapon? The Casting Hall is clearly cheating!"

Mo Shisan chuckled twice. "If you're unconvinced, you can have your master stay up for two months straight to forge a weapon for you. It might not be a treasure weapon, but it would at least be top-grade."

Yan Yuwei slumped to the ground, her face ashen, speechless for a moment.

After a long while, she turned her head. "As the chief disciple of the Mechanism Hall, don't you have any thoughts on this? Your master personally went to the Thunderfire Pool, used the Heavenly Artisan Forging Method, and worked with Hall Master Zhan to forge this weapon."

Mo Shisan, who was fiddling with a miniature tiger-shaped mechanical beast on the table, raised an eyebrow, looking at Yan Yuwei with some surprise.

"I haven't seen you in a few days, and you've grown a brain? You even know how to sow discord?"

Yan Yuwei's gaze sharpened.

*Crash!*

A hole suddenly burst open on the second floor of the Misty Rain Tower, and a black figure flew out, crashing to the ground.

Mo Shisan scrambled up, his face filled with fury. Under his wide robes, several mechanical arms like scorpion tails shot out. The ends were tipped with sharp, triangular blades that gleamed with cold light, pointing at Yan Yuwei upstairs.

"Yan Yuwei, just you wait. At the Disciple Ceremony, I'll be the first to take you down!"

Yan Yuwei crossed her muscular, vein-protruding arms and let out a cold snort.

"I'll be waiting."

As Xu Yunfan bit down on a bamboo skewer while crossing the Vermilion Bird Bridge, his nostrils flared slightly. A somewhat familiar scent flowed into his nasal cavity, making him raise his eyebrows. His originally relaxed expression turned serious in that instant.

As the Heavenly Artisan Cave spread the news of the Casting Hall's Disciple Ceremony and invited various forces, all sorts of characters, whether invited or just here for the excitement, seemed to have emerged.

The Incense Fire Sect!

This scent... he was far too familiar with it. When he passed through Wuzhou, he didn't know how many Incense Fire Sect members he had killed or how many strongholds he had destroyed. With a single War Drum Golden Hammer, he had slaughtered his way through the so-called Demon-Sweeping Heavenly Army's small contingent.

The power a long-handled heavy weapon could exert on the battlefield was absolutely beyond imagination.

He followed the scent and turned into a deserted alley. At a glance, the pedestrians coming and going were mostly family members of the generations of disciples from the Heavenly Artisan Cave's Mechanism City.

The further he went in, the stronger this unique incense fire smell became. He walked all the way to the end of the alley before stopping.

He looked at the dilapidated gate three zhang away. The crack in the door was seeping that extremely厌恶 (disgusting) aura.

Inside, there were undoubtedly Incense Fire Sect members. These rats always liked to hide in dark corners to plot disgusting things.

Xu Yunfan gripped his hammer behind his back. The scapulae in his shoulders cracked like popping beans. A four-hundred-jin object shattered the wind and smashed toward the iron-reinforced wooden door.

The moment the iron door exploded into pieces, Xu Yunfan's heel took half a step back, and the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was already held horizontally in front of his chest.

Twelve black-robed men knelt down like iron stakes, smashing into the bluestone floor. Spiderweb-like cracks mixed with dark red blood flowing from their feet.

These black-robed men had temples bulging like eggs, and exposed wrists showed earthworm-like golden lines. Their eyes were bloodshot. If you looked closely, the bloodshot in the whites of their eyes were actually constantly squirming bloodline worms. These bodies, stimulated by secret medicines, had their pain nerves already devoured by the golden line worms.

They were clearly the Incense Fire Sect's so-called Demon-Sweeping Heavenly Soldiers, who used their usual method to stimulate human potential and squeeze out vitality. They felt no pain. As long as their bodies didn't suffer fatal destructive attacks, they could still be lively for a short time.

Back in Wuzhou, when encountering such foes, Xu Yunfan would usually smash them to pieces with a single hammer.

"The little brother from the Casting Hall is quite the good hunting dog. You smelled us out."

The leading old crone tapped the ground with her iron staff. The skull embedded in the staff's head emitted green smoke. The copper eye patch covering her left eye suddenly popped open, revealing a black cannon barrel.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. This was clearly the technique of the Mechanism Hall.

His expression remained calm as he said indifferently, "The smell emitted by you Incense Fire Sect members is too polluting to the air. I really couldn't help myself."

"Sharp-tongued. Since you've found us, it saves us the trouble of kidnapping you."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly, both surprised and puzzled.

"Why are you looking for me?"

"You killed so many of our sect's disciples in Wuzhou, even overturned several坛主 (Altar Masters), and smashed several Ming尊 (Bright Lord) statues. You've long been on our Incense Fire Sect's list. Kid, since you have a bad memory, let this old woman teach you what should and shouldn't be done."

Xu Yunfan sneered, his heart stirring. Even if he was on the Incense Fire Sect's list, it shouldn't be worth the effort to chase him all the way to Cangzhou. There must be another reason.

"You?"

Xu Yunfan looked the old crone up and down, confirming that she hadn't entered the Flesh Refining Realm, and was at most a Grand Master of the Outer Three Unities. He straightened his body, raised his head, and suddenly understood a few things.

"You old不死 (immortal) has a muddled brain. How could you be qualified?"

The one-eyed crone was furious and反笑 (laughed in reverse). She sneered, leaning on her iron staff as she walked out from the dilapidated gate. "Perfect. I'll use your bones and tendons to enlighten the Bright Lord!"

With a wave of her iron staff, the first Incense Fire Sect member charged. His arms spread out to seven feet long. Iron claws extending from his knuckles tore through Xu Yunfan's shoulder clothes, revealing the Extreme Path Remnant Vest underneath.

Xu Yunfan didn't panic at all. He spun around to avoid the grab. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in his hand suddenly rotated, and the Thirty-Six Paths of the Windbreaker Hammer were immediately unleashed.

His right wrist flipped abruptly. The heavy hammer划出 (drew) a half-arc in front of him, causing the handle of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer to glow with magma-like patterns.

The sect member who charged first had his arm joints twist backward. In the sharp whistling sound of the iron claws tearing through the air, the three-inch-long fine steel fingernails barely brushed past his arm, but only刮出 (scraped) five white marks on the surface, not even breaking the skin.

*Crack!*

The hammer head精准 (precisely) smashed into the sect member's elbow joint, crushing the arm bone with a sound like rotten wood snapping.

Xu Yunfan顺势 (took advantage of the momentum) twisted his waist and spun. The nearly four-hundred-jin heavy hammer swept out with the centrifugal force, causing the air to炸出 (explode with) a buzzing sound.

The second sect member's shin bones broke the moment the hammer wind touched him. His残躯 (maimed body) collapsed half a brick wall like a torn sack.

The remaining few rushed forward one after another, but couldn't take a single hammer from Xu Yunfan. The heavy hammer swung around; if it touched, they were injured; if it hit, they died.

At this moment, the old crone's iron staff suddenly exploded into three sections. The tail mechanism弹出 (sprang out) a nine-foot-long chain blade.

As the poisoned blade edge brushed past Xu Yunfan's ear, he clearly saw some meat fragments stuck between the links of the chain blade, clearly not cleaned properly.

"The seventh one."

Xu Yunfan let out a low shout, spun his waist, and the moment the heavy hammer in his hand touched the ground, the copper spring at the end of the hammer handle suddenly弹出 (sprang out).

*Bang!*

An invisible force suddenly压塌 (collapsed) down within a three-zhang radius around Xu Yunfan. The incredibly powerful energy forcibly pressed the ground down three inches.

If the old crone hadn't retreated violently, she would have been included in this hammer strike.
