# Chapter 241: The Scholar's Pavilion Poetry Gathering, and Li Mo's Mid-Autumn Gift!

Tonight in Yunzhou City felt less like a night and more like a perpetual twilight. The lights of countless homes blended on the night sky like neon, and the clouds seemed dyed with the colors of intoxication.

Before leaving, Li Mo went to check on Mu Rongxiao.

Well, he was still hard.

He was placed in the backyard, looking like a statue of a Buddha.

"Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, Brother Mu Rong. Don't say I forgot about you."

Little Li was a man of great loyalty.

He placed a plate in front of Mu Rongxiao, upon which were mooncakes stacked in the shape of a pagoda.

Not only was he loyal, but Li Mo was also thoughtful.

The tavern was by the lake, and mosquitoes were abundant. So, he lit three sticks of mosquito-repellent incense, found a censer to hold them, and placed them together in front of Mu Rongxiao.

Mu Rongxiao: "....."

Hmm...

Suddenly, he looked quite dignified and solemn.

"It's a shame you're too busy to go out and play today. Since that's the case, bless me from the tavern that all my affairs may go smoothly."

Li Mo clasped his hands together in a sincere bow.

Many commoners would perform rituals today; those near mountains would worship the mountain god, and those near water would worship the water god.

He didn't have much faith in such things, but he certainly enjoyed the ceremonial aspect of it.

Leaving the tavern, he saw the young maiden by the lake. She was gazing absently at the bustling street. The noise and clamor rushed toward her but seemed to part around her, clearly illustrating what it means to stand alone in the world.

Only when a certain youth came into her sight did the smoke and fire of the mortal world appear in her eyes.

"Where do you want to go first?" Li Mo asked.

"The Scholar's Pavilion."

Ying Bing tied her hair up.

When she was eating earlier, she had heard the commotion coming from the Scholar's Pavilion. The market street was the most lively in Yunzhou, with particularly many stalls selling all sorts of trinkets. One could get there by following the Yulong Street.

She still hadn't figured out what to give Li Mo.

She didn't know what to do on a date either.

But it was okay. She could just 'see how others do it' to learn.

"Alright."

The two walked into the street, and the prosperity of the era washed over them.

Ying Bing looked at the street seriously for the first time, her gaze sweeping over the various trinkets.

Li Mo, however, didn't look around much at the variety on Yulong Street. After all, he was quite familiar with the stall owners...

His peripheral vision was wrapped around Ying Bing. She had changed into a shorter dress after dinner, revealing her fair and slender calves. Her black hair was tied with a red thread, and her jade-like face shone as she looked around. She made people forget the bright moon in the sky.

She was peerless and aloof. Just standing next to her brought immense pressure.

However, a scene flashed in Li Mo's mind: the first time she cooked, she had ended up looking like a little striped cat.

Sensing the gaze beside her suddenly carrying a hint of amusement, Ying Bing remembered seeing many men and women earlier, all laughing and talking.

".....The moon is very beautiful today," Ying Bing said.

"Indeed," Li Mo replied without moving his gaze.

"......"

Ying Bing suddenly didn't know what to say.

*You say that so decisively without even looking at me.*

They fell silent.

Neither spoke again, but as they walked under the brilliant lights, Ying Bing's heart instead felt calm.

Saying nothing felt quite comfortable too.

This was probably going with the flow.

Speak if you want to, stay silent if you don't. Even if they didn't say a word, it wouldn't feel awkward.

Before long.

They arrived at the Scholar's Pavilion, where the atmosphere was even more lively.

The pavilion stood eight stories high, towering above the surrounding pavilions and terraces. The crowd around it was packed layer upon layer, and the sound of voices was like a downpour.

"What are they doing?"

Li Mo glanced over and saw a few familiar figures.

It was the Three Heroes of Hengyun who had visited him today.

Among them, Wu Chushu wasn't alone but had a female companion with him. She was dressed exquisitely, likely the daughter of a wealthy family.

At the moment, he was speaking confidently, as if everything was under his control.

Beside him, Bai Jinghong and Cao Mu were giving him the death glare.

*Damn it, so this is why he was so kind to invite us to the lantern festival today.*

*He actually had a date!*

*So unfair.*

"What are you guys talking about?"

Li Mo suddenly spoke up.

---

"....."

Wu Chushu's smile instantly vanished.

He recalled some unpleasant memories.

The smile didn't disappear; it just transferred to the faces of Bai Jinghong and Cao Mu.

"Ahem, I brought Miss She to see the Scholar's Pavilion poetry gathering."

Wu Chushu cleared his throat and said to the woman beside him:

"This is..."

"Battle Soul of the Auspicious Wife!" Miss She answered抢先.

Li Mo: "......"

Could someone spend some money to change the evaluation on the Hidden Dragon List?

He would even accept a little commission fee.

He changed the subject and asked:

"What is the poetry gathering?"

Wu Chushu intended to show off his vast knowledge in front of the beauty.

So he began to explain.

Li Mo got a general idea.

Legend has it that there was once a senior swordsman in Yunzhou who was not only peerless in swordsmanship but also exceptionally talented in literature. He passed the imperial examination in one go and became the Zhuangyuan (Top Scholar). However, at the banquet for the Jinshi (Successful Candidates), he got drunk and wrote a poem criticizing current affairs, which angered the previous emperor, and his title of Zhuangyuan was stripped.

So he simply resigned and returned to Yunzhou to build this Scholar's Pavilion.

"Every year during the lantern festival, there is a poetry gathering here. Those who can match the given topic receive a prize."

"This year's prize is a jade hairpin, of quite good quality."

As Wu Chushu spoke, the smile returned to his face.

As a lover of showing off in public, his literary talent was quite good (in his own opinion).

The Scholar's Pavilion was a location he had specifically chosen...

"Brother Chushu, I really want the prize from the poetry gathering," Miss She said in a soft, coquettish voice.

Bai Jinghong and Cao Mu trembled with anger, their fists clenched. *What is this? What kind of talk is this?!*

"By the way, Young Hero Li, why are you out alone?"

"Could it be..."

Seeing Li Mo alone, the two felt a bit of comfort.

At least someone was there to share the firepower.

But soon, Ying Bing appeared holding a flower lantern. She wasn't here to enjoy the festival; she looked like a fairy inspecting the mortal world.

Perhaps because the crowd was a bit crowded, she stood particularly close to Li Mo.

Bai Jinghong: "......"

Cao Mu: "......"

The two exchanged a glance. *They should have just rotted away in Sword City. Why did they have to stick their noses in for no reason?*

"Ice Cube."

Li Mo suddenly spoke, then reached out to brush the stray hair from her cheek to the side. The skin he touched felt like fine silk and warm jade.

"Hm?"

"Your hair seems to come loose often."

"It's tied with a cord, so it's a bit easy to loosen."

Ying Bing was momentarily dazed, then nodded.

She was dazed not just because of the mortal world before her, but also because she remembered the past.

What was she doing at this exact moment in her previous life?

Probably standing atop the high Osmanthus Palace, watching the tides of the human world rise and fall.

She had certainly experienced the chilling loneliness of being at the top.

But because she had to maintain a pure and detached heart, she had never stepped into the red dust of the mortal world.

"Then... how about I give you a hairpin for the Mid-Autumn Festival?"

Li Mo's voice sounded by her ear.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes, looking at the youth before her who had brought her into the mortal world. Suddenly, the corners of her lips lifted slightly. That smile gave a tangible form to the soft beauty of the moonlight.

The people around them were instantly dumbfounded.

Even the coquettish Miss She stared blankly.

"Okay."

"......"

It was Little Li who was stunned instead.

He had been racking his brain just moments before, thinking about which senior's poem to plagiarize to show off.

Seeing that smile, he suddenly didn't need to think anymore.

A poem, whose content he remembered but whose author he did not, surfaced in his mind.
