# Chapter 25: The Trading Conference  

Qin Chong immediately took out the empty honeycomb and placed it beside the ant queen, releasing a trace of honey from within to lure her inside.  

However, after waiting for a while, the ant queen remained motionless, seemingly still lost in a pleasant dream. Seeing this, Qin Chong grew anxious, but impatience wouldn’t help.  

After nearly half an hour, the ant queen finally stirred, inching forward along the thin trail of honey—though at a pace ten times slower than a snail’s.  

Another half-hour passed before the ant queen fully entered the honeycomb. Qin Chong let out a long sigh of relief—only to blurt out, "Damn it!"  

He didn’t have a spirit beast pouch. How was he supposed to carry this thing out?  

This was a major problem.  

Sighing, he realized his only option was to gamble: hide the ant queen for now, return to the surface, and find a way to trade for or buy a spirit beast pouch.  

Though he had a plan, executing it wouldn’t be easy.  

Spirit beast pouches were rare commodities, each worth over a thousand spirit stones—far more valuable than ordinary storage pouches.  

Calming himself, Qin Chong decided to focus on gathering the spirit stones first. He would hide the ant queen afterward, using his newly acquired Five Elements Concealment Formation to keep it safe.  

Removing the spirit stones from the outer layer was simple—he could pluck them out by hand without tools, and clearing away impurities was much easier now.  

This was because the ant queen had absorbed much of the stones’ spiritual energy, causing them to shrink slightly.  

As for the damaged spirit stones, Qin Chong tossed them into the Eight Trigrams space, hoping the miraculous golden soil would restore them.  

He resolved to finish collecting all the spirit stones before returning to the surface.  

This meant missing the monthly submission deadline, but since some miners occasionally submitted every two or three months, it wouldn’t raise suspicions.  

The only oddity would be his ability—as a mere third-level Qi Refining cultivator—to stay underground for so long.  

After relentless effort, Qin Chong finally finished gathering all the stones just before the two-month mark. In total, he obtained over 1,300 intact spirit stones and 500-600 damaged ones.  

He decided to keep 200 for himself and submit the remaining 1,100.  

Given his apparent cultivation level, submitting over a thousand stones was already impressive, especially for his first solo mining expedition.  

During this time, he also used his remaining dozen spirit stones to cultivate mid-grade spirit stones. The process drained his energy repeatedly, leaving him exhausted.  

But to secure a spirit beast pouch, he had no choice but to push through.  

Upon returning to the surface, Qin Chong promptly submitted the stones and collected his reward.  

He then sought out Chen Mo, an experienced miner who might know where to obtain a spirit beast pouch.  

Luckily, he arrived just as Chen Mo was leaving his stone hut to descend into the mines—likely for the last time, as his three-year term was ending.  

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Qin—are you here to see me?" Chen Mo seemed surprised. Miners rarely interacted aboveground, spending most of their time in the tunnels.  

"I have a question for you, Fellow Daoist Chen," Qin Chong said, skipping pleasantries.  

"Ask away. I’ll answer if I can."  

"Do you know where I can get a spirit beast pouch?"  

"A spirit beast pouch? Planning to tame a spirit beast?"  

"I encountered a burrowing beast in the mines. It digs through rock incredibly fast, so I thought it might be useful."  

"Not a bad idea. Some miners here use spirit beasts to speed up excavation."  

"Any leads?"  

Chen Mo pondered for a moment before replying, "There’s a trading conference tomorrow night. You might get lucky there—though spirit beast pouches aren’t cheap."  

"I’m aware. If it doesn’t work out, so be it."  

"Worth a try. I’m heading down now—take care."  

"You too. Thanks for the tip."  

Chen Mo’s farewell hinted this might be their last meeting, a sentiment Qin Chong silently acknowledged.  

The trading conference’s location didn’t need to be specified—the residential area was small enough to stumble upon it easily.  

The next evening, Qin Chong prepared briefly before heading out. He quickly found the event in a large hall adjacent to the stone submission area.  

To his surprise, several Foundation Establishment cultivators were present, including Huo Qiang, making Qin Chong uneasy.  

The hall was packed with forty to fifty Qi Refining cultivators, bustling with noise. Qin Chong chose a secluded corner and sat on the steps.  

The conference hadn’t officially begun, but the turnout suggested it would start soon.  

Given the mine’s two hundred-plus Qi Refining cultivators, this was a decent gathering. Qin Chong spotted familiar faces—fellow miners who’d arrived with him.  

"Everyone, we’ll begin now. Quiet, please," announced Huo Qiang, to Qin Chong’s surprise.  

The crowd settled, shifting to the edges or sitting on the floor like Qin Chong. Only a handful of wooden chairs were available, reserved for higher-status attendees.  

At the center of the hall were long tables laden with materials, herbs, and artifacts for Qi Refining cultivators.  

"First, we’ll auction items on display. Call out if interested, and I’ll announce prices. Competing bids will go to the highest offer," Huo Qiang declared.  

It seemed the items belonged to the Foundation Establishment cultivators, who were shrewdly auctioning them off for profit.
