# Chapter 142: Meeting an Old Acquaintance Again

Time and space seemed frozen in that final moment, the scene becoming eternal.

After an unknowable length of time, the surrounding starry sky shattered like a mirror with a "crack," leaving Lin Shan and Black Skeleton Demon Monarch staring at each other in shock. The sensation of having their thoughts frozen was something they had never experienced before.

"That last immortal court powerhouse was..." Lin Shan swallowed hard, forcing out the words as he fixed his gaze on Black Skeleton.

The demon monarch seemed reluctant to elaborate, only offering an ambiguous response: "Exactly who you think it was."

"Whew—"

Having inexplicably wandered into this mirage and witnessed an interstellar battle, Lin Shan felt his emotions surge like tidal waves. The experience made him acutely aware of his own insignificance while simultaneously stirring a longing for the vast world beyond.

He had no idea where this battle had taken place—perhaps in the distant heavens, the ancient immortal realm, or even his homeland from his previous life! The flying saucer representing technological civilization particularly stirred long-buried memories.

As he pondered, the howling wind and white expanse around him brought him back to reality. He suddenly remembered that he had entered this place while chasing the "Illusion Spirit Ancient Tree."

Snapping back to attention, he scanned his surroundings and spotted a small sapling lying motionless not far away.

Lin Shan approached and picked up the sapling. The enhancement panel showed no reaction—clearly, the plant was still alive, and living beings couldn't be appraised.

He tugged at a small branch but couldn't break it off. Drawing his black iron sword, he struck at it, only to chip the blade!

Enraged, Lin Shan pulled out his treasure-grade Severing Water Sword and began sawing at the branch.

"Screech—screech—"

The small sapling in his hand seemed to wake from the pain. Upon realizing it was being sawed, it immediately began shaking its leaves frantically.

After a while, a small section of the branch was severed, and drops of vibrant green sap oozed out. The lecherous Black Skeleton Demon Monarch swiftly produced a small bottle, collecting every last drop while the sapling tearfully ceased its struggles.

This time, the enhancement panel responded.

**[Illusion Spirit Ancient Wood]**
Quality: Fourth-grade spiritual material  
Description: A branch from a ten-thousand-year-old Illusion Spirit Ancient Tree, used for illusion techniques, formations, and artifact forging.  
Enhancement cost: 64 points

Quality: Fourth-grade spiritual liquid  
Description: Sap from a ten-thousand-year-old Illusion Spirit Ancient Tree, aids in cultivating illusion techniques, enhances resistance to illusions, and can refine illusion-based elixirs.  
Enhancement cost: 64 points  

Having obtained two treasures in one go, Lin Shan couldn't help but burst into laughter. Black Skeleton Demon Monarch joined in with his eerie cackling, while the sapling in Lin Shan's grip trembled, its leaves rustling in fear.

This Illusion Spirit Ancient Tree was clearly a golden goose—a renewable resource. Whether it was the wood or the sap, Lin Shan could use them himself or trade them with high-level cultivators. As long as he didn't kill the goose that laid the golden eggs, he could reap benefits slowly.

"This tree took ten thousand years to gain sentience, equivalent to the intelligence of a three-year-old. That makes it easier for you to control," Black Skeleton Demon Monarch said evasively, clearly angling for a share of the spoils. He now had his own storage pouch, secretly filled with items he had pilfered from Lin Shan, always dreaming of independence.

"If only it had seeds, my 'Scattering Beans into Soldiers' technique could gain a high-tier combatant," Lin Shan mused, ignoring Black Skeleton's hint. He didn't want the demon to accumulate too much wealth, lest he become the master instead of the servant.

After thoroughly examining the sapling, they found no fruits or seeds. Perhaps this spiritual tree was born of heaven and earth, reproducing through means other than seeds.

Lin Shan then took out a spirit beast pouch, forced a master-servant contract onto the sapling, and tossed it inside to amuse itself. For now, it would have to make do with cramped quarters until he could arrange better accommodations.

Following the guidance of the Void Star Compass, Lin Shan twisted and turned through the miasma-filled Illusion Wind Belt until he nearly lost his bearings. Finally, he emerged into open air, where a sliver of daylight spilled down.

After trekking another few hundred miles along a narrow path, the landscape opened up, signaling his complete exit from the Poison Burial Great Gorge.

No sooner had he left the gorge than he heard deafening battle cries ahead. Soaring into the air on his sword, Lin Shan saw a massive military camp not far from the gorge's entrance. However, it seemed sparsely defended, with only a few hundred righteous cultivators holding the line against an assault.

The attackers were none other than his former superior, Yan Yuanchun, and her forces!

Yan Yuanchun had somehow navigated the Illusion Wind Belt ahead of him, leading over three hundred subordinates—including Luan Chun and three other female Foundation Establishment cultivators—while leaving Lin Shan behind.

Whether out of sheer audacity or overconfidence, this female protector had launched a direct assault on the righteous faction's camp. It was an astonishingly bold move!

In truth, it wasn't entirely surprising. Days earlier, the battle at Dongmen Pass had reached a stalemate, with the Black Lotus Sect nearly breaking through the city's defenses. The righteous faction's Violet Sky Sect, responsible for the central theater, had scrambled to reinforce Dongmen Pass by withdrawing troops from other regions.

The Poison Burial Great Gorge's entrance was left to the Cangxuan Sect, a mid-tier sect whose remaining forces consisted mostly of the elderly, weak, and injured. This was a classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul—prolonged defense inevitably led to vulnerabilities.

Upon emerging from the Illusion Wind Belt and discovering the weakened state of the righteous camp, Yan Yuanchun had seized the opportunity, recognizing it as a heaven-sent chance to claim a major victory.

Her sudden ambush caught the righteous cultivators completely off guard. Many of the camp's rune cannons and arrow towers had been destroyed, but the remaining formations allowed the defenders to mount a desperate resistance. The vanguard of demonic cultivators pressed the attack, and the battle raged fiercely.

Though most of Yan Yuanchun's forces were expendable rogue cultivators, she had over a hundred loyal female disciples who had followed her from Yichuan. Protected throughout the journey, they now proved their worth.

Siege engines—battering rams, scaling ladders, catapults, and ballistae—were assembled, and puppets were deployed.

In the sky, Yan Yuanchun dueled a righteous Golden Core cultivator astride a snow-white spirit crane, surrounded by eighteen crescent moons. The opponent clearly had the upper hand, slicing apart the countless goldfish and carp summoned by Yan Yuanchun's Mandarin Duck Brocade Pouch treasure.

"Should we join in?" Lin Shan and Black Skeleton Demon Monarch observed the battle from afar, debating whether to participate. While the demonic forces seemed to be gaining ground below, Yan Yuanchun appeared to be struggling in the aerial duel.

"Go! That woman seems to be setting up a killing move—this battle is winnable!" Black Skeleton Demon Monarch's sharp eyes discerned Yan Yuanchun's strategy. Convinced she wouldn't attack without a plan, he urged Lin Shan to seize the opportunity for merit.

Though the skeleton lacked moral fiber, his judgment was reliable. Lin Shan was about to charge forward when a thought struck him.

Pulling out his summoning banner, he gave it a shake. A vortex appeared, disgorging a crowd of figures who tumbled to the ground unceremoniously.

"Oof! Weren't we in the Illusion Wind Belt? Where is this?"
"Ah! It's the Envoy! Did you save us?"
"Master, you've finally rescued us! We missed you so much!"
"Waaah! I got lost in the forest on the first night and barely survived. I never thought I'd see you again!"

The group, suddenly freed, wept with gratitude, clinging to Lin Shan's legs with effusive praise. To his surprise, some who had gone missing on the first night had actually survived.

"You're something else, lasting four or five days in that den of poisonous critters!" Lin Shan mentally noted the man's name for future cultivation.

Unfortunately, his right-hand man, Old Man Zhong, wasn't among them. Something must have happened to him.

Without further ado, Lin Shan led his men in a roaring charge toward the righteous camp.

The battle had reached its climax. Led by four Foundation Establishment cultivators, the Black Lotus Sect's forces had destroyed numerous siege engines and breached the camp's walls, engaging the defenders in close combat.

Lin Shan's twenty-odd subordinates, initially listless, perked up upon seeing their side's advantage. They eagerly scaled the ladders and joined the fray—a perfect illustration of "laughing in victory, cursing in defeat."

Black Skeleton Demon Monarch wasn't idle either. Shrinking down, he leaped from Lin Shan's side, resumed his original size, and unfurled his Bone Banner. Hordes of skeletal warriors wielding cleavers emerged.

While his minions looted shattered rune ballistae and carried materials to his storage pouch, the demon monarch scavenged the battlefield unabashedly. Fellow disciples who recognized him as Lin Shan's "pet" could only grit their teeth in silence.

Lin Shan didn't interfere with Black Skeleton's looting. If the demon wanted to hoard materials for crafting siege engines and building an army, so be it. Since Lin Shan lacked forging skills, allowing his subordinate to grow stronger was acceptable.

Instead of lingering on the walls, Lin Shan flew into the camp on his sword. There, he found Yan Yuanchun's four female Foundation Establishment disciples already deep in combat.

To his surprise, the young Luan Chun was dueling a righteous Foundation Establishment cultivator near the central command tent.

The woman wore an elegant blue gown, her arched eyebrows coldly noble, her crimson lips alluring yet untouchable. Her entire demeanor exuded an air of unapproachable grace.

Recalling that the Cangxuan Sect of Yingchuan was stationed here, the woman's identity became clear.

She was none other than an old acquaintance he hadn't seen in a long time!
