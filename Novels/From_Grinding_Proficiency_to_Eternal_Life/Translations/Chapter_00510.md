# Chapter 510: Destroying the Treasure Tree

Wukong’s staff strike, fueled by rage, not only unleashed all the spiritual power condensed from his foundation but also carried the十几 (ten-odd) types of violent Heavenly and Terrestrial Fierce Qi he had just swallowed without fully refining.

Sharp Metal Fierce Qi tore through the sky, Profound Cold Fierce Qi froze spiritual energy, and Nine Heavens Thunderfire exploded with a deafening roar...

These terrifying Fierce Qi, with vastly different natures and conflicting properties, were forcibly fused at the tip of the staff, stimulating each other and collapsing into a chaotic madness.

The protective runes collided violently with this chaotic, violently extreme destructive energy.

There was no earth-shattering boom, only a heart-piercing, tearing sound, as if the foundation of the universe itself was being ripped apart.

The nine-colored auspicious light shattered inch by inch like fragile glass, turning into a rain of light that scattered. Before it even hit the ground, it had already dimmed and vanished.

The protective array laid out by True Lord Pudu couldn't even last a single breath before it was forcibly breached by this chaotic flood of energy containing the origins of multiple Heavenly and Terrestrial Fierce Qi.

Qingfeng and Mingyue, who had been standing by, froze, their expressions of pride completely stiffening.

*Impossible! How could a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator possibly shake a restriction set by a True Lord?!*

The scene horrified them; they never imagined that this immortal peach tree could be shattered by Wukong with a single staff strike.

However, the facts spoke for themselves. The shadow of the staff met no further obstruction and smashed squarely onto the trunk of the ancient tree.

*Thump!*

A dull sound, as if striking ten-thousand-year-old divine iron, exploded.

There was no flying sawdust, no crisp sound of branches snapping.

In the terrified eyes of Wuneng and Wujing, the treasure tree—which carried countless origins of Heavenly and Terrestrial Fierce Qi and glowed with flowing light—suddenly revealed countless spider-web-like cracks, fine and deep as ink, starting from the point where the staff tip struck.

The cracks spread instantly throughout the entire peach tree.

Branches, roots, and even the few remaining core immortal peaches swaying on the branches were all swallowed by the cracks.

Then, an indescribable scene unfolded before the few of them.

As if crushed by an invisible giant hand, the entire treasure tree suddenly collapsed and shrank inward.

The originally full and plump branches and trunks visibly withered and dried up, jade-green leaves instantly turned to black powder, and countless pure origins of Fierce Qi—Fire Fierce, Thunder Fierce, Metal Fierce, Water Fierce, Wind Fierce—erupted wildly from the cracks like a punctured balloon.

In an instant, the colors of the wind and clouds changed within the central courtyard.

The violent energy flow tore through the air, forming a raging storm of Fierce Qi.

Red Fire Fierce collided with blue Cold Fierce Qi, exploding into large patches of ice crystals and steam.

Green Wind Fierce tore through space with a piercing shriek.

Purple Thunder Fierce turned into electric pythons that darted around, blasting black holes into the ground.

Metal Fierce Qi was like millions of invisible blades, silently flattening the surrounding rockeries and stalagmites!

That celestial wonder, the immortal root, now resembled a forcibly drained energy core. In the span of just a few breaths, it lost all vitality and brilliance, turning into a pitch-black, twisted, crack-covered stump—like something frozen by ten-thousand-year-old ice and then ravaged repeatedly by thunder and fire—standing ugly and charred at the center of the storm.

The air was filled with the pungent smell of scorching and the faint fragrance of dissipated pure energy, mixing into a nauseating scent of death.

The vast origins of Fierce Qi were barely one-tenth of what they were, and countless chaotic Fierce Qi filled this once serene courtyard of the Taoist temple.

Wujing and Wuneng’s legs went weak, their faces turning deathly pale.

"It's over, it's really over now. I'm going to turn into roasted pork," Wuneng said with a look of despair, staring at the charred treasure tree before him.

Such a calamity of immense proportions—even grinding their bones to ash wouldn't settle it.

True Lord Pudu's methods are unpredictable; the two of us are just ants. I'm afraid even fleeing into the Sea of Bitterness wouldn't save us from the cycle of reincarnation.

Wujing trembled, his lips quivering as he muttered, "Maybe we should just commit suicide. If we commit suicide, there's still a chance for our true spirits to escape, enter the Underworld, and enter the cycle of the Sea of Bitterness to be reborn."

Wuneng subconsciously agreed, "Reasonable, reasonable. Maybe we even have a chance to be reborn as humans, so we won't have to be demons anymore."

"Treas... Treasure tree..."

Qingfeng and Mingyue’s eyes were wide and round, bloodshot instantly filling the whites of their eyes. The blood drained from their faces, leaving only endless despair and surging fury.

The sect's supreme treasure they had guarded for hundreds of years, treating it as their very life, had vanished into nothingness right before their eyes.

"Ah! You beast! I'll fight you to the death!"

Qingfeng, his eyes bursting from their sockets, let out a piercing, extreme shriek. His spiritual power surged, sending his hairpin flying and leaving his hair disheveled.

He formed a seal with his hands, and a green-light sword was suddenly summoned. Carrying a resolute killing intent, it stabbed straight toward Wukong, who was standing dumbfounded before the charred tree.

Mingyue was even more grief-stricken and indignant. He didn't even bother to cast a protective spell, relying solely on his hatred. He condensed a palm-thunder in his hand and slapped it toward Wukong's back, throwing all caution to the wind.

The spiritual power of the early Foundation Establishment stage was pushed to the limit by them. At this moment, the foundations of Qingfeng and Mingyue manifested, turning into the异象 (phenomenon) of Qingfeng accompanying Mingyue.

However, amidst the dissipating storm of violent Fierce Qi, it appeared so pale and powerless.

"Hmph, early Foundation Establishment, and you dare make a move on me?"

Wukong's heart was still filled with vicious intent. Seeing the two young boys charging at him like madmen, a flash of impatient ferocity crossed his eyes.

He simply flexed the muscles on his right arm, his monkey fur bristling like steel needles, and casually swept his staff horizontally.

Whoosh!

The wind from the staff was like a whip, tearing through the air with a crack.

The shadow of the staff arrived first, followed by two dull sounds.

Qingfeng's oncoming flying sword was accurately knocked aside by the staff's body. It let out a mournful cry and spun into the darkness, its whereabouts unknown.

As for Qingfeng himself, he was struck by the aftermath of the staff wind squarely in the chest. It was as if he had been hit by a giant hammer. He spat out a mouthful of blood, his small body flying backward like a torn sack. He slammed heavily into the courtyard wall, slid down limply, and instantly lost consciousness.

Mingyue fared even worse. Before his desperate palm-thunder could even touch the hem of Wukong's clothes, the horizontally sweeping shadow of the staff had already landed on his shoulder.

*Crack.*

A clear sound of bone fracturing rang out.

Mingyue didn't even let out a scream. His body twisted unnaturally in mid-air, spinning half a circle, and crashed heavily to the ground, also losing consciousness. Only blood gushed from his mouth, dyeing his Taoist robe red.

In just two staff strikes.

The two Taoist boys under True Lord Pudu were lying on the ground, their life or death unknown, forming a miserable picture with the peach tree that had turned into charred coal.

*Plop.*

*Plop.*

Wuneng and Wujing could no longer hold on. Their legs went soft, and they plopped down onto the Fierce Qi-filled ground. Their faces were as white as paper, their lips trembling, and they could only repeat over and over.

"It's over... over... it's completely over now!"

The fat on Zhu Wuneng trembled all over. His mind held only one thought: *skinned and tendons pulled, soul refined in fire...*

It's over!

Sha Wujing's face was ashen. Deep in his eyes were only fear and regret. The veins on the hand gripping the crescent moon shovel bulged, but he couldn't muster an ounce of strength to resist.

"Ah... Amitabha... Sin! Sin!!"

A Buddhist chant filled with shock, anger, despair, and a hint of breakdown sounded at the entrance.
