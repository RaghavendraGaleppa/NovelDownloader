# Chapter 23: Slight Panic! Only 98% Confidence in Solving the Case!

Li Zhengjing wasn’t particularly concerned about the enmity between the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official and that cold-faced youth. However, he was very attentive to the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official’s guidance.

The hanging bird had been frightened unconscious and hadn’t woken up yet, so Li Zhengjing didn’t bring it back with him. Considering the bond with Elder Bai Xiao, the bird was unlikely to end up dead. 

After leaving the "Spiritual Official Hall," Li Zhengjing couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief. The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official was unfathomably powerful, with a fierce and bloody demeanor, exuding an oppressive and sinister aura. No wonder that young man named Fan Kaihu had become so twisted.

**"A case from half a month ago?"**

Li Zhengjing returned to the residence prepared for him by the local authorities and placed the Five Elements Creation Tree on the ground, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the soil and water.

As dawn approached, he headed to the government office to review recent case records. The registrar he had met the previous day hadn’t arrived yet, but the person guarding the records was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old youth named Lu Xiaoxuan.

"Immortal Master, please wait a moment. I’ll retrieve the case files for you," the boy said with a respectful bow.

"Was the late Constable Wu, who was killed by the demonic entity, your adoptive father?" Li Zhengjing vaguely recalled seeing the boy’s name on the list.

"Yes," Lu Xiaoxuan replied respectfully, lowering his voice. "I’m not a disciple of the immortal sect, but with my adoptive father’s help, I was able to secure a position in the government. My name has already been submitted to the sect, and in two more years, my five-year term will be complete."

Within the jurisdiction of the immortal sect, local governments could submit lists of individuals like him—minor officials who, after serving for five years, would be considered equivalent to having completed five years of menial labor within the sect. 

Once the five-year term was fulfilled, they would qualify to participate in the sect’s outer disciple examination.

"Constable Wu laid the foundation for you. In two years, entering the outer sect shouldn’t be difficult," Li Zhengjing remarked.

"Thank you for your auspicious words, Immortal Master!" Lu Xiaoxuan bowed again, though his emotions were complex.

In two years, he would only be eligible to take the outer disciple examination, with no guarantee of success. Yet, this person before him was likely no more than two years his senior—already an inner disciple of the immortal sect, his status far surpassing that of his late adoptive father.

**"Found it."**

Li Zhengjing examined the case records from half a month ago. That day, there had been seven cases involving extortion, unpaid debts, petty theft, and even a homicide.

"I was the one who filed that case," Lu Xiaoxuan said softly. "A couple from out of town claimed they were searching for relatives but couldn’t find them. They said they planned to settle here and start a business. In reality, they were thieves who had drifted into the area. Under the guise of business, they targeted a household and attempted to rob them that night but were beaten to death on the spot."

"Oh?" Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow. "Was this case handled personally by your adoptive father?"

"Yes," Lu Xiaoxuan confirmed.

"The household that was robbed—was the owner named Cai Yue?" Li Zhengjing cross-referenced the records from the previous night and said calmly, "The first victim killed by the demonic entity was this Cai Yue, correct?"

"Yes," Lu Xiaoxuan replied.

"Good." Li Zhengjing spread the case files on the table and compared them carefully before speaking slowly. "After Cai Yue’s death, two minor officials went to investigate and were also killed by the demonic entity. These two officials were the same ones who assisted your adoptive father in handling the theft case half a month ago."

"T-this…" Lu Xiaoxuan trembled. "Are you suggesting the demonic entity is killing people because of that case from half a month ago?"

"Perhaps it’s just a coincidence," Li Zhengjing said. "But your adoptive father was also killed by the demonic entity. Of the four people involved in the 'theft' case, all four are dead. There are still three others…"

"Those three aren’t here," Lu Xiaoxuan said. "One went to the prefectural office in Qixing Prefecture to report to the governor. Another went to the immortal sect to deliver the news. The third was sent to a neighboring county to summon Commander Zhou, an 'Inner Qi' realm expert, to assist in the investigation."

"None have returned yet?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"Zhang Yu, who went to the sect, and Zhang Chao, who went to Qixing Prefecture, returned last night to report and went home," Lu Xiaoxuan said.

"Summon them here," Li Zhengjing ordered.

**"No need!"**

A voice came from outside. "They won’t be coming."

Li Zhengjing turned to see four people entering the government office. The one on the far side was the registrar he had met the previous night. The other three—two men and one woman—were dressed in white robes with silver tokens at their waists. They were clearly inner disciples of the immortal sect.

These three must have accepted the case after him and rushed here overnight.

**"They arrived quickly. It seems the sixty merit points are quite enticing,"** Li Zhengjing thought to himself.

"Just now, the night patrol officers reported," the registrar said with a bow. "Zhang Yu and Zhang Chao were both killed last night—drained of blood."

"Hmm?" Li Zhengjing’s eyes narrowed, though he wasn’t entirely surprised.

"We initially thought this demonic cultivator was merely reckless, practicing his sinister arts within our sect’s territory to absorb blood and enhance his cultivation," one of the inner disciples said. "But after hearing Junior Brother Li mention these two, it seems he isn’t killing indiscriminately."

"It appears Junior Brother Li has already uncovered clues and identified the demonic cultivator’s pattern," another inner disciple said arrogantly. "So, enlighten us."

Li Zhengjing glanced at the name on his token.

**Chen Bing?**

Was he just an ordinary Chen disciple, or was he from the Chen clan, the same lineage as Chen Youyu?

He didn’t bother wasting his inner qi to confirm the man’s identity and simply replied, "Why should I?"

"Arrogant!" Chen Bing’s face darkened with anger. "You’ve only been an inner disciple for half a month. You should address me as senior brother! How dare you refuse to answer me?"

Li Zhengjing placed a hand on the hilt of his sword and smiled. "Not happy about it? Come and try to cut me down, then."

Chen Bing was furious, but the disciple named Zhou Mo stopped him with a raised hand and turned to Li Zhengjing.

"Junior Brother Li, this demonic entity’s abilities are likely not weak. For him to dare commit crimes within the territory of our Feather Illumination Immortal Sect, he must be confident in his strength," Zhou Mo said slowly. "We’re not here to steal your sixty merit points. We’re here to save your life! You’ve only been in the sect for half a month, barely forming your inner qi. You’re no match for him."

Before Li Zhengjing could respond, the young woman spoke up.

"I also have clues. We can exchange information."

She carried a wooden box on her back, which she now set down. She glanced at Li Zhengjing and then at the other two before continuing, "This matter involves a demonic entity and the lives of local civilians. As disciples of the immortal sect, we should prioritize the greater good over personal grievances."

Her features were delicate, her figure tall and slender, and her tone was cool as she spoke. "As for the merit points for slaying the demon, they should be divided based on contributions—but that’s a discussion for after the demon is dead, not now."

She opened the wooden box, and a black eagle descended from the sky, landing gracefully atop it. With a snap of her fingers, a white wolf the size of a calf bounded in from outside, its aura fierce and vibrant.

She looked at the three of them and said, "After learning of the two officials’ deaths, I sent them out to investigate."

Li Zhengjing observed the black eagle and the white wolf. **"Both are awakened beasts, comparable to the Inner Qi realm. This woman must be from the Beast Taming Hall."**

He glanced at her token, which bore the name **He Qingyu**.

"The intelligence provided by the Public Affairs Hall was incorrect. This demonic cultivator is stronger than expected."

"Based on residual energy traces, his cultivation is at least at the mid-tier of the Inner Qi realm—sixth or even seventh layer."

"His weapon is likely an iron hook."

"And his footprints are light, suggesting agile movement."

He Qingyu continued, "Among the four of us, Senior Brother Chen Bing has the highest cultivation—seventh layer of Inner Qi. But even he may not be superior to the demonic cultivator."

Chen Bing snorted disdainfully. "Let’s assume the worst and consider him at the upper tier of Inner Qi. Even at the same realm, with the techniques of our immortal sect, I have absolute confidence in defeating him!"

He shot Li Zhengjing a mocking glance. "As for Junior Brother Li, you’d probably be killed in a single encounter. Yet you still dare to dream of claiming these sixty merit points?"

Li Zhengjing ignored him and asked He Qingyu, "Can you track the demonic cultivator’s location?"

He Qingyu shook her head slightly. "The demonic entity’s energy is too chaotic. My white wolf can’t follow it."

Li Zhengjing wasn’t surprised. He glanced at the two freeloaders before turning back to He Qingyu. "A word in private."

"What do you think you’re doing?" Chen Bing snapped, while Zhou Mo’s expression darkened.

Li Zhengjing walked to the side and shared the clues he had uncovered with He Qingyu.

"So, after committing the crimes, the demonic cultivator didn’t flee. He stayed here—perhaps for revenge?" He Qingyu frowned.

"Exactly," Li Zhengjing said. "The three officials were sent to deliver messages, which spared them initially. The demonic cultivator could track their residences but didn’t know where they went. It’s also possible they were sent in different directions, forcing the demonic cultivator to wait here for their return."

"What kind of deep-seated hatred would make him take such a risk and stay?" He Qingyu murmured, puzzled.

Li Zhengjing had some idea from Fan Kaihu’s words but didn’t think it appropriate to share. Instead, he said, "Of those involved in the 'theft' case, only the official sent to summon Commander Zhou from the neighboring county remains."

He Qingyu pondered for a moment. "I’ve met Commander Zhou. He was once an inner disciple. After turning sixty, he applied to become an outer sect elder but was rejected and sent here instead. His skills are formidable. If that official is with him, he should be safe. The demonic cultivator wouldn’t dare act in front of Commander Zhou."

"But the demonic cultivator might not know about the government’s internal arrangements," Li Zhengjing pointed out.

He Qingyu’s eyes brightened with realization. "So you think the demonic cultivator, unaware of Commander Zhou’s presence, will continue watching the official’s residence, waiting for his return?"

After a pause, she hesitated. "This demonic cultivator is strong. Aside from Senior Brother Chen Bing, the rest of us might not be able to subdue him. This matter…"

Li Zhengjing shrugged. "I’m just exchanging information with you. The rest isn’t my concern."

He Qingyu thanked him and said, "As long as the demonic cultivator remains at large, the civilians’ lives are at risk. This information is crucial. I can’t hide it from the other two senior brothers."

Li Zhengjing didn’t respond. The moment he learned the demonic cultivator was "agile," his confidence in capturing or killing the entity had dropped—from absolute certainty to **98%**.

To prevent the demonic cultivator from escaping and harming civilians, he had shared his findings with He Qingyu. He knew she would inform the other two, but he didn’t mind. Now, everyone had the same information. Whoever captured or killed the demonic cultivator and claimed the sixty merit points would depend on their own abilities.

With that in mind, he studied Chen Bing and Zhou Mo carefully before relaxing.

**"Good. Both are weaker than that dead waste, Chen Youyu."**
