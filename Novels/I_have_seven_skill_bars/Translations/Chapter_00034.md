**Chapter 34: Evil Cultivator**

Previously, Ma Wen had been resting on the other side of Spirit Field 377. He then saw the battle erupt and personally witnessed Yang Shou's astonishing combat power. When he realized Yang Shou intended to kill Ding Rui, and that Ding Rui had no chance of survival, Ma Wen immediately decided to circle around Yang Shou from the other side and rush towards Ding Rui's position. It had to save Ding Rui and then take Ding Rui to fetch reinforcements together. Only it had this ability now. But it could only do this much. It was still a young horse, just faster and sturdier, but still unable to withstand Yang Shou's terrifying fighting prowess.

"Get on! Quick!" Ma Wen had already run up to Ding Rui, nudging Ding Rui's face with its neck to urge him. Ding Rui gritted his teeth, gathering all his strength to leap onto Ma Wen's back.

"Watch out! Run!" At that moment, Mu Tian's shout rang out again. Ding Rui and Ma Wen looked back to see Yang Shou had already broken free from Mu Tian and was charging straight towards them. Yang Shou had initially thought that Ding Rui, being heavily injured, would have no escape, so he planned to deal with the more troublesome Mu Tian first. But Ma Wen's sudden appearance startled him. If Ma Wen managed to take Ding Rui and escape, he wouldn't just be doomed today; he wouldn't even manage to kill a single enemy.

"Pfft!" Ma Wen spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, but it did not stop. Instead, it continued to push forward.

"Ah! Die!" Ding Rui kept his eyes on Yang Shou, who was relentlessly pursuing them from behind. At this moment, Yang Shou unleashed another burst of True Essence. Although less potent than the previous one, it was equally ferocious. Ding Rui knew that Ma Wen was the most crucial factor now; if Ma Wen also lost its ability to move, then the two of them, man and horse, would likely be left behind alive by this evil cultivator Yang Shou and perish utterly. In a flash, Ding Rui didn't know how he mustered such resolve. He lunged backward, sliding to Ma Wen's rear flank, and flattened himself, using his own body to shield the area where Ma Wen was about to be attacked. "Don't mind me, keep running!" he yelled, then closed his eyes.

*Bang!* A dull thud. Yang Shou's savage True Essence struck Ding Rui.

"Pfft!"

Yang Shou's evil cultivation technique had undoubtedly reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage. If given more time, he might have unknowingly broken through to the Core Formation stage. A Core Formation evil cultivator, right here in the sect's spirit fields! Mu Tian felt his scalp tingle just thinking about it. The sect's attention to cultivators in the spirit fields was truly too lacking.

*Whoosh...* Yang Shou's fist, whistling with wind, heavily smashed onto Mu Tian's blocking arm.

*Bang!* A muffled sound. Mu Tian was completely pushed back by the immense force. Mu Tian was currently within the sect's spirit field area, and furthermore, the sect elders forbade him from leaving the sect to participate in battles before reaching the Core Formation stage.
