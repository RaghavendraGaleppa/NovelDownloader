# Chapter 85: The Golden Severing Grass!

Gu Yuan and Senior Brother Li exchanged knowing smiles, leaving the others in the hall with no choice but to sigh in resignation.

The world was never fair, and cultivation was no exception.

Compared to those from prominent families or master-disciple lineages, disciples from humble backgrounds faced far greater hardships in their cultivation journey.

Though the Lecture Hall provided foundation-building Daoists to teach and allowed students to ask questions, these Daoists were not their personal mentors. While they could answer doubts, expecting the same treatment as direct disciples was nearly impossible.

Take today's lecture, for example. The Daoist had given Gu Yuan three methods—superior, middle, and inferior—but they were far too vague, merely general directions.

For the superior method, where could one seek the body seal that could enhance aptitude? For the middle method, where could one find the dual cultivation technique or the rare treasure? 

As for the inferior method of gradual progress, which elixir should one purchase?

These answers were left for the disciples to discover on their own.

This was the trial every disciple of the Hidden Dragon Academy had to endure.

After all, even foundation-building cultivators had their own families and disciples. The academy could never achieve true fairness.

But Gu Yuan had no intention of submitting to such trials. Fairness was something one could create for oneself.

The "Purple Jade Tranquil Incense," worth over five hundred spirit stones, was his bridge to "fairness."

Though foundation-building cultivators were powerful, they were still human.

Gu Yuan simply hadn't expected to encounter a "fellow traveler."

But upon reflection, it made sense. Senior Brother Li was already at the ninth level of Qi Refinement. At such a stage, he was no ordinary disciple and naturally had his own methods.

"Junior Brother, though you've obtained the golden talisman with the steward's help, don't set your hopes too high. The superior method is difficult to obtain..."

Senior Brother Li glanced at the golden talisman in Gu Yuan's hand and sighed. Then, with a smile, he added, "But our earlier agreement still stands. My younger sister is exceptionally beautiful. If you fail to obtain the method, come find me at Crimson Rainbow Cave!"

With that, he mounted his magical artifact and departed.

Gu Yuan shook his head helplessly, then tightened his grip on the golden talisman and rode his jade shuttle back to Qian Yuan Cave.

"You've offered a treasure, and I shall not be stingy. I will impart all three methods to you, but whether you can obtain them depends on your own fortune."

Inside Qian Yuan Cave, Gu Yuan channeled his spiritual energy into the golden talisman, and a voice immediately echoed in his mind.

"In our academy's Scripture Transmission Hall, there is a body seal called the 'Primordial Seal.' This seal can transform a cultivator's entire bone structure into a primordial physique. With this seal, the bottleneck of Qi Refinement will vanish, ensuring you reach the ninth level. However, unless you are a direct disciple of a Golden Core master or a blood relative, obtaining this seal is as difficult as ascending to heaven. Not only is the method to acquire it arduous, but refining the seal itself is even more challenging. Unless Sword Fox Sovereign personally intervenes, you can forget about succeeding."

"This method—use it wisely."

"As for the middle method of dual cultivation, I can teach you the 'Nine Palaces Yin-Yang Art.' If you find a female cultivator at the eighth level of Qi Refinement and cultivate with her for seven days, you will surely break through. However, while effective, this method has its drawbacks. In the future, you will inevitably be influenced by her, drawn into the path of emotions, losing full rationality—you will love what she loves and cherish what she cherishes."

"Of course, the same applies to the woman. She will love what you love and cherish what you cherish. If you are determined to find a cultivation partner, this method is worth trying."

"As for the rare treasure method, there is currently a promising opportunity."

"Among the Five Great Families of the academy, the Bian Family owns a third-tier spirit island. On this island grows a unique herb called the Golden Severing Grass. This herb is naturally imbued with spiritual energy and possesses extraordinary effects—it specializes in severing cultivation shackles."

"Aside from providing it to their own disciples, the Bian Family also sells this herb to academy cultivators to foster goodwill. With my golden talisman, you may enter the island. However, this herb is precious, and many seek it. Be prepared for competition."

"This herb not only severs shackles but also refines all your spiritual energy, enhancing the power of your future sword seals!"

"As for the inferior method, judging by your dignified demeanor and proud spirit, I doubt you would choose it. After all, the inferior method carries significant risks—elixir toxicity that hinders future cultivation."

"But since I have accepted your treasure, I must inform you."

"Grind Three-Star Elixir with Moonlit Grass into a liquid. Take it three times a day for half a year, and you may break through your bottleneck."

The voice of Xiang Ronghua flowed smoothly from the golden talisman, detailing the specifics of the three methods.

"Truly worthy of a foundation-building cultivator—knowledgeable and experienced. These five hundred spirit stones were well spent..."

Gu Yuan stored the golden talisman away, unable to suppress a sigh of admiration.

Without Xiang Ronghua's guidance, uncovering such information on his own would have taken untold effort.

Now, though he had spent a fortune, his path forward had been laid out clearly before him.

This was akin to "buying knowledge" from a foundation-building cultivator.

"The superior method is excellent, but it's truly beyond reach..."

Recalling Xiang Ronghua's words about the superior method, Gu Yuan felt a stirring in his heart but ultimately shook his head in resignation.

Over the years, he had used the Stone Liquid multiple times, yet never once had he encountered an opportunity related to a "body seal."

Body seals were seals that altered fate—difficult to obtain as ascending to heaven.

Unless he successfully became Sword Fox Sovereign's direct disciple, there might be a sliver of hope.

But those accepted as disciples by a Golden Core master were all prodigies of extraordinary talent—why would they need a "Primordial Seal"?

"Dual cultivation is tempting, but its drawbacks are too severe. It's not an option. For now, the only choice is to try for the Golden Severing Grass!"

After a moment of contemplation, Gu Yuan mounted his flying shuttle and left the cave once more.

Yunxuan Island.

Located in the northern part of the Nine Rivers Great Marsh, this island was far from the Hidden Dragon Academy. Gu Yuan flew for a long time before finally spotting it.

The island wasn't particularly large, but its shape was peculiar—like a treasure ship tilted into the marsh.

Perpetually shrouded in mist, the island resembled a massive cloud taking root, giving it an ethereal, fairyland-like appearance while also blocking all attempts at detection.

For cultivators below the foundation-building stage, even entering the island was impossible.

"Whoosh!"

Gu Yuan stopped outside the island, took out the golden talisman, and infused it with spiritual energy. The talisman immediately shone brightly, like a golden arrow shooting into the island.

"Whoosh!"

Before long, the mist on the island parted slightly, revealing a staircase formed of swirling clouds.

Gu Yuan followed the misty steps downward. After an indeterminate distance, whispers suddenly reached his ears.

"Another one! So many humans have come to the island lately!"

"Hmph, it's all because the Golden Severing Grass is ripe. They're all here for it!"

"This human is quite handsome—aloof and cold, just like... just like what the young mistress calls it—'aloof and transcendent'!"

"Pah! That's for girls! For boys, it should be 'heroic and majestic'!"

"Sigh... I wonder if he brought any treats. Ever since the young mistress arrived, she's eaten all the island's flower nectar. I haven't had any in ages."

"Quiet! The entire Misty Vale was gifted to the young mistress by the master. Until she reaches foundation-building, we can forget about tasting nectar."

"Shh! Stop talking—that human seems to have heard us. Oh no... I think he has supreme-grade spiritual sense..."
