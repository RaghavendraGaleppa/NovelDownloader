# Chapter 87 Discovery

Compared to the shadowy figures within the Five Ghosts Soul Refining Banner, the bronze corpse was more akin to a perpetual motion machine—stronger, faster, and more efficient.

However, the bronze corpse had its limitations. It couldn't cast spells or perform long-range attacks like flying swords, making it purely a close-combat entity.

Li Shiming retrieved a massive axe from his storage bag and handed it to the bronze corpse, which obediently accepted the weapon. He then led it to a corner of the training chamber. First, he used the Flaming Sword to carefully carve into the wall, meticulously extracting a cubic meter of rock and storing it in his storage bag.

Next, he directed the bronze corpse to dig downward. This served two purposes: easing his own workload and honing his control over the corpse. 

Controlling the bronze corpse involved two methods. The first was issuing clear commands through the blood pact, which the corpse would follow using its combat instincts—such as attacking a target relentlessly until destruction. The second was direct manipulation through the blood pact, where the corpse would act like a puppet, obeying his every move. Of course, it couldn't perform beyond its capabilities, such as casting a spell like "Spring Breeze and Gentle Rain."

A downward tunnel quickly took shape within the small mountain peak, with Li Shiming storing all excavated rocks and soil in his storage bag. He wasn't digging blindly—after careful analysis using IBMz15, he had mapped out Eagle Beak Island's terrain and formulated a precise excavation plan based on the cave's structure.

With the bronze corpse's immense strength and the lower-grade axe artifact, digging through rock and soil was effortless. After reaching a depth of ten meters, Li Shiming ordered the corpse to carve out an underground chamber. At this depth, he could easily climb in and out without needing a ladder.

The entrance was sealed with the previously extracted rock, meticulously processed in the computer space to fit perfectly. He opted for this simple method over magical seals, as his current abilities made physical barriers more reliable.

The planned underground space was a hundred square meters with a three-meter ceiling—large enough for his needs while maintaining structural integrity within the mountain's rock.

Li Shiming's ten-cubic-meter storage bag soon filled up, forcing him to make multiple trips to dump the excavated material into the surrounding ocean, leaving no trace behind.

Just as the bronze corpse was finishing the chamber, the axe suddenly struck an unexpected void. Sensing the anomaly through the blood pact, Li Shiming halted the digging. He carefully chiseled away at the rock with the Flaming Sword, revealing a natural opening in the final corner of the chamber.

Frustrated at having unintentionally breached the chamber, he wondered where this passage led. Lacking sufficient magical means to explore, he turned to technology—launching a drone equipped with night vision. 

The drone navigated the winding tunnel, descending over thirty meters, moving sideways for another hundred meters, and then dropping five more meters before emerging into an astonishingly vast underground space. What Li Shiming saw through the drone's feed defied expectations—this wasn't just beneath Eagle Beak Island, but extended far beneath the ocean floor.

The space was colossal, far larger than his planned hundred-square-meter chamber. Intrigued, he decided to investigate further, expanding the natural tunnel to accommodate himself and the bronze corpse. Soon, he stood on a newly carved platform at the tunnel's end, peering into the darkness.

Using a waterproof, battery-powered lamp—a product of his idle experimentation—he illuminated the cavern. The space resembled a professional indoor basketball arena, mostly dry except for a small thirty-square-meter pool in one corner.

Puzzled, Li Shiming muttered, "This doesn't make sense. How is this space so dry when it's below sea level?" According to IBMz15's calculations, the cavern should be submerged. Moreover, the air was fresh, unlike the stale atmosphere expected in a sealed environment.

Taking a deep breath, he froze. The air was saturated with spiritual energy—far denser than the subpar spiritual vein on Eagle Beak Island, rivaling the concentration achieved by his spirit-gathering array. 

"Could there be another spiritual vein here?" he wondered. This would explain the clean air, as spiritual veins naturally purified their surroundings. 

Jumping down, he examined the cavern floor—solid rock without cracks, preventing seawater intrusion. The entire space seemed carved from a single massive boulder. 

His excitement grew. This hidden cavern, rich in spiritual energy, might be the perfect location for his envisioned technological base—far surpassing his original plans.
