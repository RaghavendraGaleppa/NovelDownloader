# Chapter 146: Concealing Spirit within Mechanisms

Xu Yunfan watched as the humanoid mechanical armor, manipulated by the black-gold threads shot out from his Hundred-Refinements Filament Qi, took a few steps. Then, a grating, tearing sound of metal rang out from within the armor before it collapsed with a resounding crash.

Xu Yunfan: "..."
Mo Shisan: "..."

"Ahem, it must be because I forcibly altered the stress structure of the materials. That's why this happened. If I were to forge it again according to the proper mechanical structure, it should work. I'll go think about it..."

He had intended to show off his prowess but ended up making a complete fool of himself instead.

Ignoring Xu Yunfan, who had fled as if escaping, Mo Shisan knelt down with burning passion. His eyes trembled with adoration as he ran his hands over the wreckage.

"So that's how it is... I see, it can be done this way too..."

Leaving the Mechanism Hall and emerging onto the ground, Xu Yunfan glanced at the slowly dimming萤石 (fluorite) lamps on the ceiling. He strolled through the streets, heading toward the Foundry Hall's驻地 (base).

Theoretically, there had been nothing wrong with the humanoid mechanical armor. Having lived in a modern era of information explosion in his previous life, Xu Yunfan knew plenty about robotics. Having just obtained the complete Art of Heavenly Crafting, he couldn't resist the urge to try his hand.

After all, the Heavenly Cavern was situated in an ancient feudal society with extremely limited information. Although this world had various supernatural martial arts, major powers guarded their secrets jealously and would never contribute them willingly. One could say that the Heavenly Cavern was already astonishing enough to construct the Heavenly Crafting Fortress, a near-wonder of the world.

In the days that followed, Xu Yunfan, having completed the Art of Heavenly Crafting, naturally stopped his studies. Instead, he spent his days by the Thunderfire Pool, wielding his Xuan Steel Forging Hammer to strike a Xuan Steel mechanism chest.

The Heavenly Cavern lacked almost everything except Xuan Steel. Every time the high furnace built by the Heavenly Crafting Department by the Thunderfire Pool was tapped, nearly ten thousand catties of raw Xuan Steel ore were refined into molten Xuan Steel flowing out. There were five such furnaces built beneath the Thunderfire Pool, constructed to the absolute limit of what the Thunderfire Cave could bear.

As the five Xuan Steel furnaces beneath the Thunderfire Pool trembled simultaneously and molten iron surged through the channels like crimson dragons, driven by the mechanical beasts pumping bellows below...

*Clang!*

Xu Yunfan's skillful hammer stamped the final Mo Family 'Non-Aggression' pattern onto the surface of the mechanism chest. As the three hundred and sixty gears inside meshed, they instantly sucked in all the sulfur steam within a radius of thirty meters, leaving nothing behind.

It was the lost method of "Concealing Spirit within Mechanisms" from the Art of Heavenly Crafting!

According to the methods of the Heavenly Cavern's Mechanism Hall, one would need to cultivate the Hundred-Refinements Filament Qi into their bone marrow and then undergo an extremely complex process to forge a mechanism chest with the ability to conceal spirit.

Cultivating the Hundred-Refinements Filament Qi into one's bone marrow meant one was already a Marrow Cleansing Grandmaster, a feat that would take an eternity to achieve.

How could it be as easy as Xu Yunfan, who, despite being one step short of the External Three Unifications, could forge it so effortlessly?

*You have forged a Xuan Steel mechanism chest capable of concealing spirit.*
*Your understanding of the Art of Heavenly Crafting seems to have deepened slightly...*

"..."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but glance at his attribute panel, his mouth twitching slightly. The Art of Heavenly Crafting was truly too high-end; forging such a mechanism chest didn't even increase the proficiency bar by a single point.

*Click!*

Taking advantage of the Thunderfire Pool's solitude, Xu Yunfan's knuckles unlatched the refined steel chest on his back.

"Lin!"

With a soft shout, the fluctuating emotions in his eyes quickly turned into a placid pool. He opened the mechanism chest he had委托 (commissioned) the Mechanism Hall to forge, revealing the dragon-head pommel of the Golden-Plated Cudgel.

In the 'Lin' state, his arm was as steady as bedrock. Just as the dragon-head pommel of the Golden-Plated Cudgel sprang out and he reached to grab it, the entire Thunderfire Cave suddenly shook violently.

*Hum!*

The magma in the Thunderfire Pool below suddenly reversed its flow, surging upward like a fountain to spray a massive lotus-shaped bloom against the ceiling.

Xu Yunfan looked down and saw a shadow entangled by nine chains of blazing iron flash past in the pool. Just as the Xuan Steel lid above promptly fell, the ends of the chains plunged deep into the magma.

Looking up, he saw the magma that had rushed to the ceiling of the Thunderfire Cave cascading down like a waterfall. His expression remained devoid of joy or sorrow. He grabbed the still-vibrating Golden-Plated Cudgel, quickly stuffed it into the Xuan Steel mechanism chest, and closed it.

The entire Thunderfire Pool, which had been vibrating and humming, instantly calmed down.

"Holy sh—!"

After exiting the 'Lin' state, Xu Yunfan leaped up in shock. He quickly scanned his surroundings. With the Art of Heavenly Crafting at his disposal, he immediately made a decision.

He stomped his foot, vaulting high into the air with the Xuan Steel mechanism chest and the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer on his back. He hooked onto a few chain bridges in mid-air and quickly reached the top of the Thunderfire Cave.

Stepping onto the Xuan Steel lid above, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate for a moment. In three big strides, he pulled down the lever in front of him.

*Rumble!!!*

The chains of the entire Thunderfire Pool fully activated at this moment.

The Heavenly Crafting Fortress's control center.

"Geothermal eruption! Activate the Black Tortoise Mechanism Array!"

Mo Han rushed over in a panic, inserting his refined steel prosthetic limb into the main control panel. The twelve layers of Xuan Steel lotus petals on the Heavenly Crafting Fortress began to spin rapidly.

Seven patterns on the floor of the Heavenly Crafting Hall began to glow red, spreading toward the armillary sphere in the center.

This scene made Mo Han's expression change slightly. The heat from the seven magma veins was being drawn, frantically converging toward the Thunderfire Pool!

Seeing this, Hong Baichuan had already appeared silently in the Heavenly Crafting Hall.

"Press the Xuan Steel lid down and re-seal it!"

"I know that, old man!"

Mo Han's refined steel prosthetic began to turn as he exerted force. However, the next moment, Mo Han felt the resistance in his hand suddenly lighten and couldn't help but let out a surprised "eh?"

"The Xuan Steel lid has been activated?!"

Inside the Thunderfire Cave, countless chains began to surge up and down. The Xuan Steel lid, weighing nearly ten thousand tons, slammed down with immense force.

*Bang!*

With a deafening clang of metal, the Xuan Steel lid crashed down, embedding itself into the pre-set mechanisms and crushing the churning Thunderfire Pool, sealing it completely.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan finally let out a sigh of relief. He then quickly fled the scene.

At this moment, his heart was churning, and an uncontrollable excitement surged within his chest.

Deep within the Heavenly Cavern, inside the Thunderfire Cave, beneath the Thunderfire Pool... there was actually a divine weapon!

The Mo Family's 'Non-Aggression' patterns carved on the ceiling of the Heavenly Crafting Hall gradually faded, and spiderweb-like cracks appeared on the surface of the armillary sphere.

Hong Baichuan's hand rested on the main control panel, his brow furrowed tightly.

"The heat from the seven veins has surged three times compared to the past few months. Elder Mo, what were the records of geothermal extraction before the Sect moved here?"

"The Molten Gold Hall has been drawing eighty thousand catties of fire daily for the past half month!" Mo Han replied after a brief thought.

"That's ten times the usual amount!"

He pointed to the topographical map hanging in the Heavenly Crafting Hall. "The Lingnan Dao plan requires refining at least thirty thousand tons of firestone. Naturally, the geothermal consumption is much higher than usual."

Mo Han speculated, "It's probably because we've been drawing too much lately, leaving the area below empty."
