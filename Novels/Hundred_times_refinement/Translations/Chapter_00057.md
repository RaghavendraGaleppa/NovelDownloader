Chapter 7: Magical Tool

The sudden turn of events left Lin Xuan stunned. Zhang Yu's voice came through in a broken tone, "Well, I was wrong about you. You want to keep the treasure all to yourself?"

"That's right," Zhou Yan replied, her voice still charming but now laced with a sinister and ruthless tone. "Master, you treated me well, but I know the principle of 'having something precious and being afraid of being harmed.' I'll leave you a whole corpse out of our past connection."

Listening to their conversation, Lin Xuan's curiosity grew. Zhou Yan dared to commit the taboo of killing her master, and it was all for the sake of swallowing the treasure. What kind of treasure could be so attractive? Although he was eager to know, he didn't dare to make a move.

This senior sister was ruthless and had a much higher cultivation level than him. Lin Xuan didn't want to put himself in danger out of curiosity.

A tragic cry echoed, and a burst of blood splattered. Through the grass, Lin Xuan saw Zhou Yan pierce through her master's chest. A yellow light group emerged from Zhang Yu's body, trying to escape in a panic.

"Don't think you can escape with your primordial spirit!" Zhou Yan was prepared. She reached out with her right hand, her jade-like fingers grasping the light group.

The light group struggled, crashing left and right, but to no avail. It began to plead for mercy, "Yan'er, considering how Master treated you well in the past..."

Zhou Yan remained unmoved, exerting a bit of force to crush the light group, dispersing it into the air. Lin Xuan felt a chill watching this. Zhou Yan's heart was too cruel. It was known that all living things were composed of "body" and "soul." If the body died, the soul could still be reincarnated. However, if the soul was destroyed, it could never enter the cycle of reincarnation again. Even in the fierce battles among cultivators, they generally wouldn't destroy each other's souls unless there was a deep-seated grudge. Zhou Yan had taken such a drastic measure against her own master.

After killing her master, Zhou Yan's expression remained normal. She began to search Zhang Yu's body, and after a while, a look of狂喜 (wild joy) appeared on her face. "Found it!"

Despite knowing the danger, Lin Xuan couldn't resist his curiosity. He quietly peeked out, seeing Zhou Yan holding a box about the size of a fist. The box was made of high-quality sandalwood, exquisitely crafted. Zhou Yan gently touched it, her face filled with joy.

"Who's there?" Zhou Yan's expression suddenly changed, her eyes narrowing as she looked over, her face full of malice. Lin Xuan felt a pang of regret. It wasn't that he made a noise; a wild rabbit happened to pass by, catching Zhou Yan's attention.

Lin Xuan's mind raced, his expression turning grim. Seeing Zhou Yan kill her master had shown him that pleading or trying to deceive her wouldn't work. He decided to act, leaping out from his hiding spot, his right hand flicking out several icy lights towards Zhou Yan.

Zhou Yan snorted, forming a red protective shield around herself with her hand. The icy lights hit the shield, bouncing off. She smiled coldly, relieved. From the attack, she had judged that Lin Xuan's cultivation was weak, only at the early stage of Spirit Motion.

Lin Xuan didn't linger, turning to flee as soon as he launched his attack. The difference in their strength was too great; he had no chance in a straight fight.

He cast a wind attribute "Light Body Technique," allowing him to cover nearly a hundred meters in a few seconds. Lin Xuan didn't run in a straight line, which would have made it easy for Zhou Yan to catch up. He zigzagged, using his familiarity with the terrain to delay her. Even if she used her spiritual sense to track him, the unfamiliar path would make it difficult for her to find him quickly.

After running for a distance, Lin Xuan suddenly stopped. Instead of continuing to flee, he examined his surroundings and then crouched down to search the ground.

This action was quite unusual and puzzling. Zhou Yan was about to catch up, but Lin Xuan was delaying.

However, Lin Xuan had a purpose. After a careful search, he muttered, "Still here." His furrowed brow relaxed, replaced by a calm expression.

The sound of footsteps reached his ears; Zhou Yan had arrived nearby. Lin Xuan stood up, his face feigning panic.

"Want to run?" Zhou Yan's charming voice came over, laced with venom and mockery. She glanced at Lin Xuan's attire, confirming he was a disciple of their sect. However, this junior brother's cultivation was too weak, only at the second layer of Spirit Motion. Seeing Lin Xuan's cultivation level, Zhou Yan's expression became relaxed. Killing him to silence him wouldn't require much effort.

Lin Xuan's heart didn't anger but instead felt joy upon seeing Zhou Yan's disdain. If she underestimated him, she would be less cautious, increasing the chances of his plan succeeding. Of course, he didn't let his emotions show on his face, still appearing worried and flustered. "Senior sister, don't... don't kill me!"

His stuttering plea, combined with his panicked expression, made Lin Xuan's acting impeccable. However, his feet quietly moved two steps to the left.

"Hmph, you saw my secret and still want to live?" Zhou Yan's heart was as venomous as a snake. She wouldn't show mercy to a fellow disciple she had never met before. With a flick of her left hand, a small sword was summoned, growing to several meters long as it flew towards Lin Xuan, accompanied by dazzling sword light.

Lin Xuan's expression turned serious as he faced the magical tool. A magical tool was a simplified version of a magical treasure, designed for low-ranking cultivators. Though not as powerful as a true magical treasure, it still possessed great might, capable of flying through the air and performing incredible feats.

Theoretically, cultivators who reached the fourth layer of Spirit Motion could control magical tools. However, such tools were precious, and it was rare for Spirit Motion cultivators to own one unless they inherited it or were gifted it by their seniors.

Zhou Yan's attack was ruthless, summoning a magical tool despite seeing Lin Xuan's weak cultivation.
