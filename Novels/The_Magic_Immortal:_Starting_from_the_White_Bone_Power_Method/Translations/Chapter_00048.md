# Chapter 48: Spring Moon Cicada

The beauty mark on her face had intended to hurl more cutting remarks, but when she met Wang Chan's unabashed gaze and saw the meaningful expression on his face, her icy demeanor faltered, quickly replaced by fluster and a hint of shyness.

After all, she wasn't anything to Wang Chan—what right did she have to interrogate him?

It was just that, having repeatedly witnessed Wang Chan's flirtations with that widow while remaining indifferent to her, jealousy had inevitably taken root.

Fortunately, years of patrol duty had exposed her to countless situations. After a brief moment of inner turmoil, she regained her composure and continued, "As your neighbor and friend, I advise you to stay away from that woman. She may appear to be at the early Qi Refining stage, but her true cultivation is mid-stage Qi Refining, not far from late-stage."

Wang Chan's face displayed just the right amount of astonishment, though inwardly he acknowledged that this beauty mark, bearing the [Autumn Wind Cicada], had sharp eyes indeed to discern Madam Cheng's hidden depths.

But how much had she truly uncovered about Madam Cheng?

Noticing the subtle shift in Wang Chan's expression, the beauty mark couldn't help but feel a flicker of satisfaction. Seizing the moment, she added, "Not only that, but while her spiritual energy is refined, her aura is inexplicably chaotic. There's a hidden spring-like allure in her eyes. Though her appearance is proper, her delicate frame conceals seductive bones. Without a doubt, she practices some dual cultivation technique. If she were to set her sights on you, your lanky frame might not withstand even a single 'sip' from her."

A single sip?

She could even see that?

This woman had some skills.

Intrigued, Wang Chan couldn't resist asking, "Is she a demonic cultivator?"

"Hmph, dual cultivation techniques aren't exclusive to demonic cultivators. Orthodox and... unorthodox practitioners dabble in them as well."

"So, Madam Cheng's dual cultivation technique is formidable?" Wang Chan probed further, his tone casual.

"...Not necessarily!" The words slipped out before she could stop them. Realizing her blunder, the beauty mark shot Wang Chan a frosty glare, then summoned a white cloud artifact and flew down the mountain.

After the incident with Madam Cheng, she clearly had no mood left for Wang Chan's rejuvenating acupuncture.

Wang Chan's earlier agitation had also cooled, and with the awkward tension between them, he let her go without protest.

There would be time enough later.

When hunger struck, she would come knocking on her own.

A quaint cave abode, shielded by a mid-grade formation, lay beneath a rippling barrier of light. The interior was elegantly arranged, with lush greenery in the courtyard and the soothing fragrance of spiritual incense filling the rooms.

The beauty mark angrily stripped off her black soft armor and tossed it to the ground, changing into a light, breathable home robe instead.

The discarded armor emitted an alluring black glow—a newly acquired low-grade artifact named "Ink Rhyme," which she had spent considerable effort procuring.

She had never worn it in front of others before, hoping tonight would be the night she could employ her charms and watch a certain someone drool as he eagerly helped her out of it. Alas, it had all been for naught.

Frustrated, she retrieved a bottle of spiritual wine and downed it, her vision quickly blurring with intoxication.

Yet, even in her drunken haze, the image of Madam Cheng refused to leave her mind.

That woman—a widow skilled in dual cultivation techniques. Perhaps her late partner had succumbed to her relentless demands.

The last time she saw Wang Chan cozying up to that widow, Madam Cheng, she had dismissed it as coincidence, chiding herself for overthinking.

But now it seemed—

Wang Chan must have developed a taste for such women!

Especially since he had the audacity to ask whether Madam Cheng's dual cultivation technique was formidable.

"Hmph, Madam Cheng's seductive bones may be decent, but if I were to unleash my own, what would she amount to?"

Muttering to herself, the beauty mark flipped her palm, and a glimmer of silver light materialized. As the radiance faded, a silver cicada appeared.

Its wings trembled, emitting faint green threads of light.

She then extended her left hand, releasing a yellow cicada—the [Autumn Wind Cicada]. Freed, it chirped joyfully before sensing the silver cicada's presence and immediately prostrating itself as if before a monarch.

"What an ungrateful little rogue cultivator, daring to bear 'Cicada' in his name... If not for the [Spring Moon Cicada] choosing you, why would I, against Brother Feng's wishes, lower myself to pursue you?"

The next day, at the Black River Market.

Wang Chan set up his medical stall as usual, arriving early.

With few patients at this hour, he brewed spiritual tea and perused a newly purchased jade tome, *Detailed Exploration of the 108 Perilous Sites in the White Mountain Range*.

Though the wilderness was fraught with danger, it paled in comparison to the White Mountain Range's unfathomable depths, teeming with countless hazards.

Moreover, it housed several second-tier forbidden zones and dozens of first-tier ones.

Rumor had it that many formidable cultivators ventured into the mountains for training, returning laden with treasures—if they survived.

"I wonder what mission Madam Cheng is undertaking that requires her to enter those mountains."

As he pondered, a familiar, pleasant fragrance wafted over on the breeze. Raising his head, he saw a female cultivator in apricot-yellow robes standing before him, her figure full and graceful.

Her almond-shaped eyes, rosy cheeks, and plump lips complemented her willow-like waist—this peach seemed riper than ever.

Without waiting for Wang Chan to speak, she picked up his teacup and, ensuring no one was watching, drained it in one gulp. Smirking, she teased, "Slacking off, aren't we, Fellow Daoist Wang? Drinking tea and reading instead of tending to patients. Come, accompany me inside for some... attentive service."

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Shen. You go ahead and freshen up first. There's spiritual spring water inside. I'll join you after finishing this passage."

Wang Chan gave her a once-over before replying calmly.

With a hum of acknowledgment, the robed cultivator slipped into the thatched hut.

She was a regular, having first experienced Wang Chan's skills four months prior. Since then, she visited monthly for his "Cloud-Pushing Jade Feet" treatment—always once a month, though the timing varied.

Whatever cultivation technique she practiced, her feet always seemed troubled.

A short while later, muffled sounds emanated from the hut.

Half an hour passed before the robed cultivator emerged, leaning against the doorframe like a freshly bloomed flower. Whether Wang Chan had been too vigorous or not, her legs seemed too weak to support her.

"Fellow Daoist Shen, you must be more careful in your cultivation. The qi in your feet is severely obstructed. Without my silver needles, mere Cloud-Pushing wouldn't suffice," Wang Chan advised upon seeing her state.

"Mmm." Head bowed, she murmured in response. As she stepped over the threshold, she suddenly turned back, biting her lip as she transmitted her words secretly: "My surname isn't Shen. My real name is Su Jue."

With that, she lightly touched her cheek, and for the briefest moment, another exquisitely delicate face flickered into view before reverting to its original form.

"Ah... Fellow Daoist Su." Wang Chan blinked in surprise before cupping his hands in acknowledgment, replying via transmission as well.

"In half a month, I'll be entering the city. I won't be returning here."

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Su."

"Seven days from now, at the Langyun Teahouse east of the market, third floor, the Butterfly Blossom Room. I've picked some Water Charm Peaches. Would Fellow Daoist Wang care to sample them?"

"...Indeed!"

At the Hundred Herb Garden, Wang Chan purchased ten bottles of [Spirit Nourishing Elixir], five Cleansing Talismans, and two low-grade [Qi Restoration Pills] with twenty distinct pill patterns—quite the splurge.

Qi Restoration Pills rapidly replenished spiritual energy, proving invaluable in combat.

With the black market visit scheduled for tomorrow night, it was better to be overprepared than under.

Noticing Wang Chan's uncharacteristic extravagance, Shopkeeper Hu studied him briefly before handing over the items and transmitting covertly, "There's news on He Changkong."

He then passed Wang Chan a jade slip.

Pressing it to his forehead, Wang Chan absorbed the information:

"One of the Black Eagle Gang's leaders."

"The gang is backed by the Bai Family. He Changkong has aligned himself with Bai Shaofeng, the Bai Family's direct descendant."

"Possesses a formidable mid-grade artifact, the [Little Flat Mountain Seal], along with a low-grade spell and another low-grade artifact."

"Other abilities unknown."

"Extremely cautious and cunning. Rarely appears alone; usually surrounded by gang members. Whereabouts when solitary remain unclear... Cave abode location unknown."

Wang Chan reviewed the details several times before calmly cupping his hands. "My thanks, Shopkeeper Hu."

"Don't mention it." The shopkeeper chuckled before adding, as if struck by a sudden thought, "Ah, I heard He Changkong's cultivation partner is named Su Jue—an exceedingly gentle and refined female cultivator... Ahaha, no need for that look, Fellow Daoist Wang. You know how I am with certain types of information."
