Chapter 278: Listening to Fate, Wearing the Turbid Robe

Li Xian digested the essence of heaven and earth, sitting cross-legged with a clear mind. All things vanished, leaving him sitting alone. Gradually, he felt a thin layer of Turbid Robe enveloping his entire body. The "Turbid Robe" was an illusory object, difficult to see with the naked eye. Wen Caishang's "芥虚魔衣" (Jie Xu Demon Robe) was like an exquisite and delicate personal garment, embroidered with "interlayers" and "pockets" for storage.

When she placed items into the "interlayers," "pockets," and "sleeve bags" of the Jie Xu Demon Robe, they vanished into thin air. When she wanted to retrieve them, she simply flipped her hand and took them. It was extremely convenient and powerful. However, since it was a "garment," its storage capacity was ultimately limited. Once the "interlayers," "pockets," and "sleeve bags" were completely full, it could no longer store anything. Therefore, the items stored in the Turbid Robe must be extremely precious.

Wen Caishang's "Jie Xu Demon Robe" had another extremely powerful characteristic. No one else knew about it, and it was rarely recorded in ancient texts. Only those who possessed it knew. The White Snake Soft Sword was originally soft and sharp, but it did not have the characteristic of extension. It was the Jie Xu Demon Robe wrapping the sword body that allowed it to extend and lengthen. The word "Demon" in "Jie Xu Demon Robe" naturally came from the past of the Candle Sect, but it also implied a "demonic nature."

Nine types of Turbid Robes...

Li Xian suppressed his excitement: "Even if it is a tattered cloth robe, I need not lose heart. If it is a mid-grade or high-grade Turbid Robe, I also need not be complacent." He gradually calmed down, his state of mind clear. The Turbid Robe around him gradually revealed itself, and an invisible robe substance wrapped his entire body.

He focused his gaze and looked inward. He faintly caught a glimpse of the Turbid Robe's appearance, presenting a faint, colorless form. It shrouded his entire body in a hazy manner, revealing a powerful internal Qi. It was upright and vast, majestic and solemn.

"It's the Pure Yang Qi Robe?"

Li Xian recalled Nan Gong Liu Li's words. Among the nine types of Turbid Robes, only the "Pure Yang Qi Robe" description corresponded, with the whole body wrapped in thick Qi.

The second realm of martial arts, undergoing the process of clearing the ascension and turbidity descending. It was like a chaotic world being split into clear and turbid. When the turbid Qi precipitates, it becomes thick and permeates the body surface, lingering without dispersing, gradually transforming into a 'Turbid Robe.'

His face showed joy, thinking: "It really is the Pure Yang Qi Robe... This is truly a gift from heaven! This Qi Robe is so rare, to obtain it occasionally is truly lucky."

After the characteristics were fully revealed, Li Xian stood up and felt very strange. He focused his mind on one spot, and the Pure Yang Qi Robe faintly condensed, with a thin film separating it. The dust floating in the air was blocked from a distance, unable to approach even a fraction.

The Pure Yang Qi Robe... was not afraid of sword slashes. Wrapped in an invisible Qi Robe, he could hide Qi within the Turbid Robe, displaying all kinds of subtle changes.

Li Xian was in high spirits. Since he had obtained the Turbid Robe, he must explore its uses. He shook his whole body, and Qi energy penetrated through his body. First, he stored Qi in the Turbid Robe, then shook open the Turbid Robe. The 'Robe Substance' pushed outward, creating an invisible force that shattered the bed, wooden table, and bookcase instantly.

The Pure Yang Qi Robe was a fierce and tough robe, capable of resisting fists, feet, swords, and blades, yet不失 nimble and agile. The characteristic of "Storing Qi in the Turbid Robe" was truly unique in the world, making others envious.

"Pure Yang Qi Robe... its effect is to block swords and blades, and it can store Qi within the robe. Although the effect is simple, if used properly, it can indeed add many miraculous effects."

Warriors eat, nurture, practice, and soak, accumulating powerful internal Qi. The use of internal Qi is of utmost importance. In the past, Wen Caishang had no internal Qi, her strength greatly reduced, and she repeatedly encountered dangerous situations. This shows that "internal Qi" is the cornerstone of martial arts moves.

The internal Qi of ordinary warriors can move freely within the body, but once it leaves the body, it often becomes blocked and fragmented, making it difficult to use effectively. Only by executing martial arts moves can the internal Qi still have momentum after leaving the body.

Those who wear the "Pure Yang Qi Robe" are truly superior in the use of Qi. Simply using internal Qi to shake the robe is enough to unleash a pushing force.

Li Xian practiced hard on his own, his interest soaring.

[Shaping Bone Luo Embryo]
[Proficiency: 0/100]
[Description: Characteristics have emerged: ethereal fairy voice, three flowers gathering at the top, Turbid Robe covering the body...]

The fourth characteristic of the second realm of martial arts is named "Hair Takes Root upon Falling," also known as "Dust Settles." It refers to the evolution of the second realm's characteristics reaching this point. After a warrior appears with "Turbid Robe covering the body," they will soon "Hair Takes Root upon Falling."

The first strand of hair falling to the ground, touching the ground and growing roots, proves that the warrior has set foot in the second realm, and the inner world has begun to take shape.

Days passed peacefully.

Li Xian practiced hard for several days but did not see "Hair Takes Root upon Falling" or truly step into the second realm of martial arts. He couldn't help but frown slightly, vaguely feeling that he was slightly different, as if the characteristics had not been fully revealed.

The Flower Cage Gate's Water Altar was about to host a grand event. The news spread secretly. The talented heroes of the same sect heard the rumors and all took the elders' ships to rush to the Water Altar.

The rewards set were generous: three taels of merit silver, a beautiful woman, and a rare treasure.

In these few days, ships arrived one after another at the shore. The island was very lively, and all inns were full. The Flower Cage Gate disciples nearby, if they had the opportunity, almost all came to the Water Altar.

To the southwest of Peach Blossom Town, there is a Hundred Flower Canyon. Two high mountains surround a narrow path, with flowers blooming in the path.

Li Xian temporarily stayed in an inn and had nowhere to practice. He always liked to go to secluded places when practicing, slowly studying martial arts moves, accumulating proficiency, and condensing the Qi Lake. So he found this quiet place. The surrounding scenery was beautiful, with few people and no one to disturb.

He stepped into the flowers, grabbed with both hands, and first performed a set of "Flying Snake Hand." Actually, what Meng Han said made some sense.

The Flying Snake Hand... the name of this martial art is contradictory. Snakes belong to the category of lying on the ground, waiting for opportunities, insidious and vicious. Since ancient times, martial arts related to "snakes" have sought insidiousness and viciousness.

And "Flying Snake Hand," with the prefix "Flying" added to the snake, easily makes people misunderstand that it is a nimble and swift martial art. In fact, it is exactly the opposite. This is precisely the brilliance of this martial art.

It means a lying viper suddenly flies over. The horror of this, catching the enemy off guard, can be imagined. Martial arts like "Lying Snake Hand," "Coiling Snake Hand," and "Viper Hand" are immediately inferior in comparison.

Therefore, the "Flying Snake Hand" aims to be more insidious and vicious, attacking the unprepared, killing the enemy beyond their expectations. However, Li Xian executed this move with flying leaps and dodges, adding a sense of "python and dragon" to it.

Although it violated the original meaning of the martial art, it added his own characteristics.

Suddenly, he saw "flower bees" and "flower butterflies" flying in front of him. Li Xian smiled and said, "Let's try this move!" His hands moved in circles in the air, and the Pure Yang Qi Robe covering his body was played with by him at will. Suddenly, it became like a large cloth bag, trapping the flower bees and butterflies.

They couldn't fly out, very anxious.

Li Xian laughed heartily, very happy. He spread open the Pure Yang Qi Robe again, and the bees and butterflies flew away in all directions. Li Xian smiled and said, "Want to run?" His playful mood arose. He tapped on the flower petals with his toes, and his figure flashed into the air.

He struck out with his hands.

[You caught bees and captured butterflies, Flying Snake Hand proficiency +4]
[You caught bees and captured butterflies, Flying Snake Hand proficiency +5]

The scattered bees and butterflies were all caught back again. Li Xian went back and forth, playing with them more than ten times. The bees and butterflies were all exhausted and limp in his palm. He also felt tired, so he completely let go and released them back to nature.

There were many poisonous bees in the flower cluster. But he wore the "Pure Yang Qi Robe." When the poisonous bees' stingers stabbed, they were blocked by an invisible film half a millimeter from his skin.

He lightly shook his body, and the poisonous bees fell down in rustles, stunned and numb. Li Xian walked through the flower cluster, covered in pollen, but did not attract bee bites.

He practiced until noon, when the scorching sun was high in the sky. The summer heat was stifling, and Li Xian was thirsty and tired, so he left the narrow path of the flower valley.

He exhaled a clear breath, blowing away the pollen and wiping away the sweat. Feeling refreshed all over, he hurried back to Peach Blossom Town.

The Flower Cage Gate grand event was approaching. Talented heroes from all sides gathered at the Water Altar headquarters. Among them, the outstanding ones were the four: Ding Zelin, Wang Changjiang, Wolf Blade, and Bao Zhixian.

In Peach Blossom Town, betting pools had been set up, and the topic was very lively.

Li Xian was in a very good mood. After returning from practice, he went to the restaurant to reward himself well. He ordered some wine and dishes, and a plate of fried bee pupae.

He ate and drank, restoring his energy.

The second floor of the restaurant had a pleasant view, overlooking the flower sea on the island. At this time, the restaurant was full of Flower Cage Gate disciples.

They talked to each other:

"This grand event is quite grand."

"Yes, our Flower Cage Gate was once scattered and fragmented. Although there are many disciples, most are a motley crew. Although we know it's true, it's uncomfortable to hear."

"Hmph, if we only talk about reputation, our Flower Cage Gate is also a first-rate sect. Hehe, those disciples of big sects look down their noses at people on ordinary days, very arrogant. But if they fall into our hands, men are killed with one knife, women are tied up five flowers, no matter how good their background or high their skills, it's all in vain."

"Hahaha, this makes a lot of sense. No matter what sect prodigy or noble lady... if they are targeted by us, let's see what they can do."

"Exactly, are we going to fight them one-on-one? Hahaha."

Several of them drank Peach Blossom fresh brew, obviously a bit drunk. Li Xian smiled without speaking, continued to eat and drink, and listened to their idle talk.

"Tell me... our Flower Cage Gate hasn't held a grand event for many years. Suddenly holding a grand event now, and with such generous rewards, what is it for?"

"I've heard something about this matter."

"Oh, Brother Liu, please tell us quickly."

That Liu surnamed flower thief shook his head and said:

"It is said... our Flower Cage Gate is about to make a big move. So we are holding a grand event to boost morale! Our Flower Cage Gate, although there are many disciples, is too messy."

"In the same generation, there is not a single one who can stand out and be compared with the disciples of those big sects. Now the world is gradually chaotic, and our Flower Cage Gate has been repeatedly besieged. If we continue to be so loose and unrestrained, there might be a day of utter destruction."

"So our Flower Cage Gate wants to change the sect rules. To unite the disciples, we are holding this grand event. First, to encourage young heroes to compete and exchange skills. Second, to attract sect disciples to return to the Water Altar, as there may be important matters to announce."

Li Xian nodded slightly. The world is gradually chaotic, the dynasty is declining. The Flower Cage Gate is loose, wanting to prepare its strength to deal with the impact of the times, which is normal.

"In such a great era, who is not a tiny speck of dust? I am favored by nature, possessing an extraordinary rebirth appearance and a Pure Yang Qi Robe... I should practice martial arts diligently. To protect myself, and to protect my younger brother..."

He thought of the most important people in his life. His younger brother had become a disciple of Fu Haoran, protected by the sect and blessed with luck, so there was no need for him to worry. Gu Wanjun, although she despised him, was really good to his younger brother. She regarded him as a sect disciple.

He also thought of that lady in a white skirt, gentle and charming, dignified and vicious Wen Caishang... Although he had been intimate with her, if there was true affection, why did she want to gouge out his eyes?

Thinking of this, he suddenly felt that in this vast world, he was alone.

He drank several jars of wine heroically, slightly drunk. He thought cheerfully: "Even if no one looks up to me, I live for myself."

"Never mind all that."

He continued to drink and ordered several more jars. Actually, when Wen Caishang wanted to gouge out his eyes, he was not without heartbreak, but he had no time to be heartbroken.

He ate and drank his fill. He put down his wine bowl and was about to pay the bill and leave when he suddenly heard a commotion in the crowd. A sedan chair was passing by in the bluestone street.

That red sedan was eye-catching.

The sedan bearers were four women, with similar hair buns. The sedan was open, and the scenery inside was not concealed at all. Inside lay a阴柔 (yinrou, soft/yin-natured) young master, who was holding a beautiful woman in his arms.

The Flower Cage Gate disciples communicated: "It's Ding Zelin... he really came. It seems this grand event will have a good show to watch."

"They say he and Wang Changjiang had a feud over a beauty. They have been fighting openly and secretly on ordinary days. Now they meet at the grand event, won't they fight to the death?"

"This young master is handsome. I heard that some time ago, he used ten taels of merit silver to exchange for the 'Ethereal Graceful Hand'."

"Ah... look quickly. He is currently practicing the 'Ethereal Graceful Hand'! It is said that this martial art has very strict practice conditions. It requires a beautiful woman to help with all her heart, and their bodies and minds to merge."

"Help with all her heart... hehe, what kind of help is that?"

"Naturally, it means helping with all her heart, openly facing each other, and giving everything."

"So envious. Such a delicate flower, played with so casually."

Ding Zelin had a soft face, and the woman beside him had a blushing face. She was originally a wealthy and noble lady, with luxurious clothing and food. In the prime of her youth, she was targeted by a flower thief. She was brought here and lived on the island.

She gradually sank, and now she couldn't bear to part with Ding Zelin.

[You transported filth, proficiency +1]

Back in the inn bedroom.

Li Xian transported filth, quietly practicing internally. He abandoned the noise around him, remaining calm and constant. When he opened his eyes, the setting sun was about to disappear, and it was dusk.

The Flower Cage Gate grand event was very lively. Li Xian did have the intention to participate. He quietly prepared his strength, conserved his energy, and waited for the grand event to begin.

"I am now separated from the One Union Manor. Resources, precious treasures, money, residence... all need to be solved by myself. Since I have decided to stay long-term at the Water Altar, I should do my best to perform, obtain rewards, and then purchase a residence here."

On the other side.

After the flower boat docked, Nan Gong Liu Li was untied by the four women. They held her hands and feet, walked through a hidden passage in the boat, and entered a flower cluster.

The flowers were lush, taller than a person. Relying on the cover of the flowers, the four women took winding small steps, left and right, making it impossible for anyone to discover.

Nan Gong Liu Li had just left the cabin, and the sunlight hit her face. She squinted her eyes slightly, feeling very dazzling. In a daze, she remembered that she hadn't seen sunlight for nearly a month, hanging bound in a narrow cell.

After adapting to the sunlight, she shook her internal Qi, trying to escape from the capture. But after several attempts, her internal Qi was always dissolved by the four women.

Feeling hopeless, she was angry and ashamed, and kept cursing with extremely harsh words. She said the four women were helping the tyrant, unworthy of being human. The four of them bullied the few with the many. If they let her go, she could easily defeat them all. If they didn't believe it, they could try.

The four women heard the curses and all giggled, completely indifferent. Nan Gong Liu Li thought: "They are as thick-skinned as that flower thief, really making me angry." She cursed: "A group of lewd and cheap goods."

One woman smiled and said: "Little girl, your mouth is quite vicious. Hehe, watch how sister deals with you, making you obedient." She stretched out her finger. She poked Nan Gong Liu Li's back spine, secretly passing internal Qi. Nan Gong Liu Li trembled all over, feeling as if she was electrocuted all over, and immediately lost the strength to struggle.

The finger energy remained in her body, adding heat. The back spine itched unbearably, and it gradually spread throughout her body. Nan Gong Liu Li asked: "You... you are despicable. What... what finger technique is this!?" Her beautiful eyes were misty, with tears.

The four women all laughed heartily. They explained: "This is the 'Soft Breeze One Finger,' specially used to entertain little girls like you."

Nan Gong Liu Li cursed: "Despicable!" But her voice was soft and酥 (su, soft/brittle). The finger energy flowed all over her body, and she quickly focused her mind to resist, unable to curse and condemn anymore.

The four women saw her appearance, knowing they had subdued her, and all laughed sweetly. Nan Gong Liu Li gritted her silver teeth, several times wanting to curse, but deeply afraid of making strange sounds. She had to hold it in.

They walked for about half an hour.

Nan Gong Liu Li took a deep breath. The finger energy gradually receded. She thought: "If I don't scold, wouldn't that mean I'm afraid of them? Hmph! I would rather endure the torture than submit!"

Her heart was uneasy, truly afraid of this "Soft Breeze One Finger." If she was poked again, it would be truly miserable. If it were just body pain and death, it would be easy to endure. Suffering is suffering, what's there to say? But if there was hidden pleasure in the suffering, that would be terrible. But she forced herself to be calm, wanting to say vicious words to prove her will. But just as she opened her mouth, her back was poked again. The finger energy entered her body, climbing up her spine.

Nan Gong Liu Li secretly said it was bad. She could no longer speak, her red lips tightly closed. She secretly complained, her face full of despair.

"This... this kind of humiliation, it's... it's better to go back to the boat and drift on the water. Although my hands and feet are difficult to move, it's very embarrassing... but I've gotten used to it a bit. I don't have to suffer this kind of humiliation from them."

In the wild flower sea, there stood a pavilion. The pavilion was light green, and the flower sea swayed. The pavilion and the scenery blended perfectly, actually able to hide the pavilion completely.

If you are not familiar with the secrets of passage, it is absolutely impossible to find this place. Nan Gong Liu Li was dizzy, suffering all kinds of humiliation. She felt a blur in front of her eyes, and she was in the pavilion.

"The Flower Cage Gate bandits act sneakily and circuitously. I was carried along, and although I wanted to remember the way in case of a chance to escape, the colorful flower sea made me dizzy."

"I didn't know when I entered this pavilion. Oh no... how can I escape? This is terrible."

She was extremely depressed, complaining repeatedly. She looked around. The pavilion was very cold, but the interior decoration was all luxurious.

A cold air blew in her face. The four women carried Nan Gong Liu Li, running east and west. Although their steps were strange, their speed was not slow. Nan Gong Liu Li was dizzy and couldn't remember the route.

They came to a row of bedrooms. Each room had windows pasted with semi-transparent paper. Passing by here, you could see the situation inside.

Each bedroom held a woman. These women were in different situations. Some had their hands and feet free and sat in front of the dressing table in a daze. Some were tied hands and feet and thrown on the bed.

Nan Gong Liu Li suddenly realized: "These women are all like me, captured and brought here. I have the same fate as them, and I can't escape."

They came to a bedroom.

The four women put down Nan Gong Liu Li and pushed her into the bedroom. They said: "From today on, you will live here. Wait for the higher-ups to issue orders on how to deal with you."

Nan Gong Liu Li's feet touched the ground, and she immediately turned around and struck out with a palm. The four women had long expected this move. Two women grabbed her wrists and twisted them behind her back, while simultaneously using the "Soft Breeze One Finger" to poke her left and right ribs.

Nan Gong Liu Li's eyes rolled back, almost fainting. She had no strength to resist, her legs weak, and let the four women handle her.

The leader said: "This woman is too dishonest. We saw she was tied up for nearly a month and wanted to give her some relaxation. Hmph, she always wanted to resist. Fine, sisters, no need to be polite to her."

Nan Gong Liu Li said stubbornly: "Use whatever means you have. Do you think I, Nan Gong Liu Li, am afraid!" Her heart was actually extremely afraid. She clearly felt that although the four women's martial arts were high, they were far inferior to her.

But somehow... the martial arts of the four women were all targeted at women. And the four of them worked together tacitly, taking full advantage.

Nan Gong Liu Li was carried into the bedroom. The four women were provoked by her repeated provocations and were also angry. They all took out several zhang long flower ropes. They tied Nan Gong Liu Li's hands firmly.

Nan Gong Liu Li felt an extreme abnormality in her heart. She was angry, of course, but inexplicably accustomed to it. The leader said: "This cheap girl's martial arts are not bad, everyone be serious. Lock her joints and acupoints firmly."

Nan Gong Liu Li let out a wail. She struggled desperately, which instead stirred the four women's annoyance. They exerted their strength on the heavy parts, pulling the ropes hard. One woman said: "Cheap girl, being stubborn with us, you are asking for trouble. The厉害之处 (powerful aspects), you will slowly find out later. Hehe, by the time you beg, no one will pay attention to you."

Another woman said: "Why say so much to her, she won't remember the kindness. Besides... this big prize of hers needs to be well entertained."

Her hands and feet were tightly bound with dense flower ropes.

The four women closed the door and left. Nan Gong Liu Li sobbed alone, feeling very helpless. She slightly regretted her stubbornness just now. If she had softened a bit, she would have been much more relaxed at this moment.

She sighed softly and stopped struggling. She lay on the bed like this, enduring the time, waiting for her fate.

At midnight, the hour of Zi. A faint pink smoke seeped out from the gaps in the bedroom. It smelled faintly fragrant, very pleasant and conducive to sleep. She was tied up uncomfortably, exhausted mentally and physically, and couldn't fall asleep. Smelling the sleep-inducing incense, her soul was calm, and she actually felt drowsy.

She fell asleep unconsciously.

She woke up the next day, frowned, and secretly felt something was wrong: "Yesterday's sleep-inducing incense, was it really just for sleep? Would the Flower Cage Gate be so kind?" She was tied up by the four women and found it difficult to move.

The room was extremely quiet. She was bored, so she moved her body and observed the room's layout. Bookshelf, dressing table...

She noticed that on the dressing table, there were several sandalwood boxes. She thought: "Could these be treasures? What are their functions, why are they placed here? Let's see if they can help me escape."

She stared closely to observe. She struggled to the dressing table, and her reflection appeared in the mirror. Nan Gong Liu Li's pretty face turned red. She tried to open the sandalwood boxes.

The items inside were very strange. They were named琉璃神杵 (Glaze Divine Pestle), 极玉宝锥 (Extreme Jade Treasure Awl)... The names were very intimidating, and the materials were not ordinary. But Nan Gong Liu Li looked at them and felt they were very strange. She had a feeling that these items had no murderous aura at all, as if they were very difficult to use in martial arts fights. Nan Gong Liu Li thought: "Extremely strange, everything about the Flower Cage Gate is extremely strange."

She was bored and walked around. Unable to find a breakthrough, she lay dejectedly on the bed to rest.

The bedroom's decoration was quite elegant, much better than the cell at the bottom of the boat. Nan Gong Liu Li shook her head, looking at the ceiling decoration, feeling extremely bored.

Another day passed like this. At the hour of Zi, red smoke drifted in. Nan Gong Liu Li held her breath and focused her breathing, refusing to inhale a single breath.

But the red smoke filled the bedroom. She held on for a while, but eventually needed to breathe and still inhaled the red smoke, falling into a daze.

In the following days, she felt extremely bored. Trapped in a single room, restricted everywhere, her temper became increasingly irritable. A fire burned in her stomach, and she wanted to smash and destroy whatever she saw.

She increasingly felt that irrelevant and distracting thoughts frequently appeared in her mind.
