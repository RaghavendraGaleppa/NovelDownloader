Chapter 106: Venerable Mu Yuan, Demonic Lord of Imperial Prison

“Is that all the guts you have, kid?”

“Running already?”

The more the Immortal-Striking Stone spoke, the faster Yang Ji’s sword-wings vibrated on his back. It was a joke; with a Sky Demon comparable to a Red Dust Immortal present, he did not want to get entangled in a major karmic cause. Making a swift escape was the best course of action.

“This kid, plunging straight into the death mist, it seems he really has a way out. I can’t let him escape.” The Immortal-Striking Stone narrowed its eyes, then revealed a smile that indicated everything was under control. It shot a white beam of light at Yang Ji, binding him securely.

With a whoosh, Yang Ji was instantly pulled back.

“You run pretty fast, kid. I thought you were someone special and was thinking of going out with you, but I didn’t expect you to be such a timid coward.” The Immortal-Striking Stone suddenly transformed into an old man in white robes, with an immortal-like bearing and an air of wisdom. He stood with his hands behind his back, pointing at Yang Ji, lecturing him with disdain in his eyes.

“This junior hasn’t lived enough yet, Senior. Please show mercy and let me go,” Yang Ji said helplessly.

“Hmph, death is just another destination. I hate cowards most in my life. Since you’re so afraid of death, I’ll feed you to the Sky Demon later,” the Immortal-Striking Stone glared, huffing and puffing, threatening him.

“Senior, you’re… taking me to feed the Sky Demon, isn’t that just increasing its demonic might?” Yang Ji looked at the white beam of light binding him, then said with a placating smile, “Senior, why don’t we sit down and talk properly?”

“Hmph! You’re a sly and cunning kid; I can tell you’re not a good person at first glance.” The Immortal-Striking Stone glanced at him twice, his gaze flickering. Thoughts of [Threaten] and [Appease] surfaced in his mind, but with a flick of his finger, he still retracted the light beam.

Seeing this, Yang Ji temporarily gave up the thought of escaping and instead asked, “Senior, what exactly is this place, and why is such a terrifying Sky Demon suppressed here?”

“This is the shattered inner world of Venerable Mu Yuan,” the Immortal-Striking Stone replied.

“Venerable Mu Yuan? Why does that name sound familiar?” Yang Ji suddenly fell into contemplation, information recorded in books rolling through his mind. He suddenly exclaimed in surprise, “Venerable Mu Yuan? Could it be the Sect Master of Taiyuan Dao Sect from 200,000 years ago, Venerable Mu Yuan?”

“Precisely. You actually have some knowledge, kid,” the Immortal-Striking Stone looked at him with surprise.

“Rumor has it that Taiyuan Dao Sect was a massive Daoist lineage in the outer starfield that suddenly vanished overnight, becoming an eternal mystery. I never expected to encounter Venerable Mu Yuan’s shattered world here,” Yang Ji exclaimed in awe.

“What eternal mystery? It’s just that the old geezers at the top didn’t want to tell you younger generations. Back then, Taiyuan Dao Sect suffered a devastating assault from Outer Realm Sky Demons, incurring heavy losses and depleting its foundation. It was almost annihilated, sigh, practically annihilated. Millions of disciples all died. The entire Daoist lineage now only has me and Venerable Mu Yuan left,” the Immortal-Striking Stone sighed tragically, like an old man in his twilight years.

“An assault from Outer Realm Sky Demons? Venerable Mu Yuan? Senior, are you saying that Venerable Mu Yuan from 200,000 years ago is still alive?” Yang Ji asked in shock.

“There’s nothing to be surprised about. Nine Tribulation Immortals can live for 90,000 years. The Venerable unexpectedly broke through to the Red Dust Immortal realm, so living a mere 200,000 years is naturally not a problem,” the Immortal-Striking Stone shook its head.

“Red Dust Immortal? Then, the one suppressing that Sky Demon, who is also comparable to a Red Dust Immortal, is…” Yang Ji suddenly looked towards the unknown depths.

“Precisely, the Venerable is suppressing the demon with his own body,” the Immortal-Striking Stone lamented. “If the Venerable were to perish together with that Sky Demon, then the entire Taiyuan Dao Sect would truly be completely annihilated. The once endlessly glorious Dao Sect would completely vanish into the river of time.”

“I never thought that even a powerful Daoist lineage with a Red Dust Immortal would have a day of annihilation,” sensing the Immortal-Striking Stone’s sorrow, Yang Ji couldn’t help but shake his head.

“No Daoist lineage is eternal. They are all just fish leaping in the river of time. Since ancient times, how many Daoist lineages have become mere fleeting clouds? Only some legacies they left behind stubbornly display traces of their existence. The tragic thing is, some Daoist lineages were annihilated without even leaving behind their legacies, truly forgotten by the world forever, unable to reignite their glorious fireworks,” the Immortal-Striking Stone sighed.

“Senior, isn’t Taiyuan Dao Sect still around with you? You can also pass on the Dao Sect’s legacy and make it flourish,” Yang Ji said.

“Me?” The Immortal-Striking Stone shook its head. “I am just a small Dao artifact. I haven’t learned much, nor have I even touched upon the sect’s core immortal arts. How could I strengthen the Daoist lineage? How could I continue its glory?”

“Senior, isn’t Venerable Mu Yuan still there? You can…” Yang Ji subtly looked towards the depths.

The Immortal-Striking Stone shook its head and said, “I know what you want to say, but in a life-and-death battle between figures of that level, one’s focus needs to be 100% concentrated. Once distracted, they would fall into a disadvantageous position, with unimaginable consequences.”

“If I were to ask the Venerable to transmit his arts to me, that would be harming the Venerable, and also harming the entire Daoist lineage. If the Venerable wins, there’s still a glimmer of hope. If he loses because of me, then everything will be doomed forever.”

Yang Ji pondered for a moment, then said, “Since Venerable Mu Yuan and that Sky Demon are in a stalemate, how about I take you out to find reinforcements? Sky Demons are detested by everyone. I believe many people in the Grand Primordium World would be willing to help Senior eradicate the demonic scourge.”

“It’s not that simple. Deep inside, there’s the Nine Heavens Ten Earths Isolation Grand Array, which shields the aura of the Venerable and that Sky Demon. To get involved in their battle, one must break through the Nine Heavens Ten Earths Isolation Grand Array and enter. But if even a trace of this demon’s aura were to leak out, Outer Realm Sky Demons might detect it and come to rescue this Sky Demon. The consequences would be unimaginable then; no one would be willing to bear the risk of their sect being annihilated just to help the Venerable slay the demon.” The Immortal-Striking Stone shook its head, rejecting this idea.

“This?” Yang Ji didn’t expect there to be so many restrictions.

He looked towards the depths and asked, “What is the name of that Sky Demon inside? Even Venerable Mu Yuan, a Red Dust Immortal, cannot eradicate it.”

“Demonic Lord of Imperial Prison! A powerful Sky Demon comparable to a Red Dust Immortal,” the Immortal-Striking Stone said gravely.

“Demonic Lord of Imperial Prison?” Yang Ji murmured, then asked again in confusion, “Senior, how was the death mist outside the secret realm formed?”

“This is a manifestation of a portion of the Demonic Lord of Imperial Prison’s Dao of Death externally. This demon intends to use this method to devour the flesh and blood of external cultivators to nourish itself and restore its vitality. The Venerable, in turn, uses space-imprisoning techniques to counteract it, slowing its speed. Cultivators usually flee far away upon seeing the death mist, rendering its efforts futile. But how could this demon be willing to give up? It occasionally breaks through space, causing the mist to jump around, and sometimes people fall into it and suffer a tragic end,” the Immortal-Striking Stone explained.

“So that’s it! No wonder the death mist appears without warning and then disappears without warning. It turns out figures of such a level are secretly clashing.”

Yang Ji finally understood, but still had doubts in his mind. “Since this death mist is created by that Sky Demon, isn’t Venerable Mu Yuan afraid that Outer Realm Sky Demons will discover the demon’s whereabouts?”

“The world is vast. There are three thousand Great Realms, countless Small Realms, and infinite starfields. Sky Demons cannot be omniscient and omnipresent. If not for that, they would have long discovered the existence of the Venerable and the Demonic Lord of Imperial Prison.”

“Furthermore, there is no primal aura of the Demonic Lord of Imperial Prison within the death mist. All of its aura has been sealed inside by the Nine Heavens Ten Earths Isolation Grand Array. The external death mist is merely the Demonic Lord of Imperial Prison using its powerful cultivation realm to influence the Dao of Death between heaven and earth, causing the purest death energy to manifest. Those are death energies that have never been refined by anyone and have not been contaminated by anyone’s aura.”

“Many people cultivate the Dao of Death, so it is difficult for Sky Demons to discover any clues,” the Immortal-Striking Stone said.

“Using powerful cultivation to influence the external Dao of Death, so that’s how it is!” Yang Ji nodded, a slight change in his expression.

As the two chatted, night fell.

Just then, boom! The world trembled, and the sound of thunder rang out.

In the depths, strong winds howled, the full moon was devoid of light, and bolts of lightning descended from the sky, tearing through the dark void, breaking through the mist, and striking down.

In the depths of the secret realm, the clanging of chains could be heard at this moment, and a terrifying aura surged out, roaring, as if a primordial savage beast was about to break free.

Yang Ji suddenly ascended into the air, his gaze fixed on the direction where the lightning struck. Information immediately appeared: [Nine Heavens Ten Earths Isolation Grand Array], [Demon-Subduing Grand Array], [Myriad Annihilation Lightning-Attracting Array], [Demon-Sealing Well], [Demonic Lord], [Red Dust Immortal].

Just as he was about to retract his gaze, he saw five more pieces of information: [Early-Integration stage cultivator], [Mid-Integration stage cultivator], [Late-Integration stage cultivator], [Late-Integration stage cultivator], [Mid-Integration stage cultivator].

“Senior, there are others in the depths?” Yang Ji asked in surprise.

“Yes, they, like you, accidentally stumbled in. They managed to survive thanks to their decent cultivation. The other intruders weren’t so lucky; those below the Integration stage faced only death,” the Immortal-Striking Stone shook its head, gazing ahead intently. It suddenly grabbed Yang Ji and said, “Come, I’ll take you in to see.”

Boom!

Boom!

Thunder vibrated heaven and earth, and a destructive aura enveloped all directions. Bolts of purple lightning, following a sky-reaching iron pillar, struck downwards, plunging into an eight-zhang diameter black demonic well. Inside, purple light surged, crackling.

“Roar!”

Suddenly, a deep roar echoed from within the demonic well. A violent wind capable of scattering one’s soul surged out, causing the iron pillar extending deep into the well to tremble. Waves of tragic aura surged, carrying currents of black demonic qi.

However, the eight black iron chains locking the demonic well suddenly brightened. Endless silver runes emerged, intertwining to form a circular rune shield that firmly suppressed the demonic qi within. This was the Demon-Subduing Grand Array, suppressing the demonic qi.

Yang Ji, watching from afar, could feel the boundless, vast demonic qi and the powerful soul-suppressing aura from within the demonic well. If not for the Nine Heavens Ten Earths Isolation Grand Array locking in the terrifying aura, a single demonic roar could have instantly claimed his life.

“Quick, qi and blood are surging from over there, quickly gather them.” Five Integration stage cultivators surrounded the demonic well, constantly absorbing the blood mist that filled the sky.

“Senior, what are they doing?” Yang Ji asked in a serious voice.

“Do you see that blood mist? Those are transformed from the flesh, blood, and souls of creatures that tragically died within the death mist. Every night, these blood essences hidden in the death mist will surge towards the demonic well. If the Demonic King absorbs them, its vitality will recover, and the consequences would be unimaginable. These five people are preventing that from happening,” the Immortal-Striking Stone explained.

“Immortal-Striking Stone Senior, who is this young brother?” an old man with a withered face and a poor complexion noticed Yang Ji beside the Immortal-Striking Stone and couldn’t help but ask.

At the same time, the other four also saw Yang Ji and all cast curious glances his way.

“Oh, him? Like you, he’s someone who stumbled in from outside,” the Immortal-Striking Stone said vaguely.

“Oh? How did this young brother stumble in? And why is he unharmed?” Everyone was surprised, knowing that when they had inadvertently fallen into the death mist, they had almost lost half their lives.

“He screamed in the death mist, and I happened to be patrolling, so I helped him,” the Immortal-Striking Stone said.

“Oh?” Everyone’s gaze flickered. Cultivators at their level could infer a lot of information from just a few words. They looked at Yang Ji, then at the Immortal-Striking Stone, clearly not believing such a claim. They had all experienced the death mist and knew its power; small cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage, upon encountering even a wisp of death energy, would instantly perish. How could any screams even be emitted?

Immediately, someone secretly transmitted his voice to Yang Ji, asking, “Young brother, how did you get in?”

“I had just been caught in the death mist not long ago when I encountered Senior Immortal-Striking Stone, who was out on patrol. He shot a beam of light and saved me,” Yang Ji transmitted his voice back.

“Is that really true?” The person confirmed.

“Yes, if not for Senior Immortal-Striking Stone, I would have probably died in the mist,” Yang Ji transmitted his voice with a look of lingering fear.

“Senior, what about you? How did you get in?” he asked.

“The death mist appeared without warning, enveloping us. We thought that following the direction of light would lead us out, but we never expected that the place with light would be this secret realm. We once joined forces, preparing to break out, but we all ended up injured, and after much wandering, we still returned to this place. The death energy within the death mist is erratic and disrupted our sense of direction; we simply couldn’t get out. Yet, getting in was easy. It must be the Sky Demon’s doing,” that person transmitted his voice.

“Esteemed Lord, it seems they also want to get out. Why don’t we join forces, suppress the Immortal-Striking Stone together, and break out?” Buddha Child transmitted his voice.

“No! Let’s not discuss it for now,” Yang Ji transmitted his voice sternly.

“Kid, did they transmit their voices to you? You absolutely must not take them out. If they were to side with the Sky Demons, reveal what happened here, attract the Outer Realm Sky Demons, and release the Demonic Lord of Imperial Prison, then the world would once again become a living hell. The karma involved would be immense; could you bear it?” the Immortal-Striking Stone transmitted its voice solemnly.

This was also Yang Ji’s concern. If such a peerless demonic fiend were released, it would simply be unimaginable. But he himself was currently trapped, and the Immortal-Striking Stone clearly wouldn’t let him leave. This made things very difficult.

“Haha, everyone guard your positions. We absolutely cannot let this qi and blood surge into the demonic well. Once this Sky Demon is eradicated, the death mist outside will also disappear, and everyone can leave,” the Immortal-Striking Stone encouraged.

“The Myriad Annihilation Lightning-Attracting Array draws down Pure Yang Purple Lightning. Under such powerful heavenly lightning striking every night, this Sky Demon still won’t die. This guy’s life is truly too tenacious,” an Integration stage elder said gravely. “I wonder how many thousands of years it will take for this Sky Demon to die. It’s too long.”

“Sigh, it is indeed long. If we could draw down the Origin Divine Lightning, this Sky Demon would probably turn to ash and vanish in less than a day,” the Immortal-Striking Stone also shook its head helplessly.

“Thousands of years?” Yang Ji frowned. This was indeed too long. He couldn’t wait.

Just as he pondered, Shen Yin’s voice suddenly came through: “Big brother, I think I can draw down the Origin Divine Lightning.”
