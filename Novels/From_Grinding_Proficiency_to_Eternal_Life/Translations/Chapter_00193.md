# Chapter 193: Startled Awake

Elder Mo's words make sense," Hong Baichuan nodded. "I will send someone to arrange it immediately."

As the setting sun sank in the west, the twenty-three mechanical bronze bells of Tiangong City rang out one after another.

The disciples on the Observatory had already dispersed. Sect Master Hong Baichuan had also said he was preparing to go to Shu City to pay a visit to the Prefect.

Now that the central authority of the Yujing Dao was powerless to govern the four regions, they were practically in a state of division. It was necessary to discuss matters in advance. If the Great Qian forces were to break through the two dao and come here, they naturally had to prepare a response.

Xu Yunfan and Fu Jin remained standing on the Observatory, watching the disciples from the Mechanism Hall, led by Mo Shisan, gradually disassemble the giant kite mechanism, analyzing the holes shot into it by crossbow bolts one by one.

Time passed.

The setting sun hung on the verge of falling, its afterglow splashing over the flying eaves of Tiangong City, startling flocks of swallows into the air.

The trembling sound of the twenty-first mechanical bronze bell still echoed in their ears, yet only two figures remained on the Observatory.

Xu Yunfan leaned on the railing, looking down at the disciples of the Mechanism Hall below like a swarm of ants. Mo Shisan was directing everyone to disassemble the honeycomb crossbow mechanism at the root of the giant kite's wings; his玄晶 (mysterious crystal) goggles emitted a cold blue light in the twilight.

"Master seems to still be in Qingzhou, Yanbei Dao. I heard he's heading towards the Divine Weapon Ridge," Xu Yunfan said after a long while, a hint of anxiety in his heart.

He naturally knew why Zhan Yan had gone there. The Divine Weapon Ridge must hold some secret that could help him shed his Extreme Path remains.

"Three days ago, a flying kite sent a letter saying Master was seen in the Qingzhou region," Fu Jin suddenly spoke, his knuckles unconsciously tracing the diamond patterns on the Nine-Ring Mountain Shaking Hammer. "The Divine Weapon Ridge is located at the border of Qing and Wu states. There is a highway below it. If the two states want to互通, this road definitely won't be abandoned..."

"A peak expert of the Blood Transformation Realm who wants to leave cannot be stopped by a thousand soldiers and ten thousand horses," Xu Yunfan cut him off. The thunder-fire麒麟 (qilin) patterns on the palm of his hammer reflected the sunset. "Perhaps he found a way to suppress the Extreme Path remains and is delayed for some time."

Fu Jin's mind was already in turmoil. Zhan Yan was his backbone. He had been a disciple at the Divine Weapon Ridge and was even more so now in the Tiangong Cave.

He suddenly gripped the hammer handle tightly, the steel rings colliding and sparking: "Sixteen states of Yanbei Dao have already fallen to nine! Didn't you hear the information brought by the giant kite team? The Great Qian's ten thousand troops have surrounded Qingzhou as tightly as an iron bucket. Not even a sparrow could..."

"Do you think Master is a vegetarian?" Xu Yunfan flicked his finger against the railing. The clanging vibration drowned out Fu Jin's last words, showing that Xu Yunfan's heart wasn't as calm as his appearance suggested.

"Back when the Incense Fire Sect raided the Tiangong Fortress, he alone charged through three hundred heavy armored soldiers without getting a speck of dust on his blood-stained clothes..."

Fu Jin's tense shoulders relaxed slightly, but he frowned again: "But this time is different. There are countless experts in the Great Qian army. They don't have the concept of martial arts sects. According to Old Mo, the martial arts sects over there were all smashed and their temples destroyed by the Great Qian..."

"Great Zhou is not Great Qi. The Nine Brilliance Sect isn't made of tofu. Why do you think the Nine Brilliance Sect is still sitting calmly on the fishing platform?" Xu Yunfan replied.

After repeated attempts to persuade him, Fu Jin's turbulent thoughts were finally settled.

After parting ways, Xu Yunfan watched Fu Jin's retreating figure and couldn't help but shake his head secretly.

His senior brother's steps were already in disarray.

He viewed Zhan Yan as a father, and wasn't Zhan Yan the same? Fu Jin was raised by Zhan Yan from a young age.

He looked up towards the nine heavens.

His eyes flickered, and he felt a bit hesitant. Going out at this critical juncture wasn't a good time.

He ultimately abandoned the thought.

Early the next morning, after practicing the 'Lin' character formula, Xu Yunfan once again pried open the mysterious steel mechanism box on his chest.

"Huh?"

Seeing that the Ginseng Baby wasn't sticking its head out at all, Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows and tapped the mysterious steel mechanism box with his fingers.

*Dang! Dang!*

A few sounds, amplified by the nine-layer hollow structure inside the box, eventually sounded like a great bell tolling within the box, making the Ginseng Baby unable to bear the disturbance. It suddenly poked its head out of the hole, chattering incessantly at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan paid it no mind. He took a deep breath towards it, inhaling a wisp of Ginseng Qi into his body, then expressionlessly pressed the Ginseng Baby back into the mechanism box and closed it.

Using this wisp of Ginseng Qi, Xu Yunfan guided the Pure Yang Internal Qi to move slowly through his flesh and blood, continuously strengthening his internal energy.

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes and focused his mind. The moment the Ginseng Qi entered his body, the Dazhui acupoint on the back of his neck thumped violently. The Pure Yang Internal Qi, like molten rock, split into two streams along his spine, continuously guiding the Ginseng Qi to soak into his muscles, skin, and membranes. With each small cycle, a portion of the Ginseng Qi would merge into the Pure Yang Internal Qi, growing visibly at a rapid pace.

The blood energy stirred. As the Pure Yang Internal Qi surged through his flesh and blood, his biceps visibly swelled and contracted. Each pulse made his bones rattle like chimes.

The scorching current flowing through his fascia snapped like a bowstring.

When the morning light climbed onto his exposed back muscles, the sweat beads didn't even have time to fall before they were evaporated into mist by the astonishing heat radiating from his body.

*During the circulation of the meridian cycle, the Pure Yang Internal Qi in your body resonated mysteriously with the Ginseng Qi. The Pure Yang Internal Qi completed three major cycles through your body and arms. Proficiency has increased significantly.*

*You...*

After finishing his practice, Xu Yunfan glanced at the few information prompts that had popped up on his attribute panel.

Seven proficiency information prompts gave him a full forty-two points of proficiency. He was only one hundred and twenty points away from completely mastering the Pure Yang One Qi Technique.

Xu Yunfan was overjoyed. At this pace, where would he need half a month? Perhaps in just a few days, he could completely achieve Great Completion in the External Three Unions.

Stepping into the External Three Unions realm, he had achieved Great Completion in just two or three months.

Where in the world could one find such a shocking cultivation speed?

Unfortunately, the External Three Unions stage was special. It was about twisting the three forces of muscles, bones, and skin together, casting them into a single furnace, so that no force was wasted. Only then could the use of force enter a new realm, truly deriving 'Jin' (explosive force) from within the flesh and blood.

The External Three Unions are the secret key to laying the foundation in martial arts.

A warrior should take the three images as the foundation: muscles like a flood dragon twisting green mountains, bones like fine steel forging a sword embryo, and skin like a heavy armor covering a golden bell.待到三力相合，形成龙虎之力，方得三力交缠如龙蛇起陆，举手投足间可爆发出远超自身形体的威力。

This step can lay a solid foundation for the next step into the non-human realm.

After breakfast, Xu Yunfan was preparing to wield the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer to activate the Red Serpent Mountain Shaking Jin within him. Now that the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shaking Hammer Method had formed a skill, no matter which one he practiced, the other two would improve with the growth of proficiency, making it much easier.

"Senior Uncle Xu!"

A disciple from the Casting Hall慌慌张张 (in a panic) pushed open his courtyard gate, waving a letter in his hand.

"Master left a letter and said it should be given to you!"

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted, and he immediately had a few speculations in his heart.

Xu Yunfan unfolded the letter. The pine-soot ink contained a familiar cold iron aura, a hint of the coldness that came from Fu Jin's blood qi after forging weapons for years.

Fu Jin's handwriting was like a broken blade carving stone, its force penetrating the paper: '...
