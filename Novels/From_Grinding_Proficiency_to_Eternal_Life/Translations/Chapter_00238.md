# Chapter 238: The Fierce Flood Dragon

Qi Huan fell silent for a moment before nodding slightly. "Brother Xu, feel free to command me."

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. Qi Huan was being so compliant that it almost made him feel guilty about what he planned to do.

Had Qi Huan shaken his head and tried to leave, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer behind him would have taught the man what true hammer techniques were.

He would have certainly shouted, "Where do you think you're going?"

Without further hesitation, the two sped toward the Chixia Mountain peak.

Naturally, Xu Yunfan did not act as brazenly as before. His steps were like arrows shooting forth, yet he landed without a sound.

Two hours later, when the breathing sounds from the Ruogong Cave stronghold and the Ghost Weeping Abyss reached their ears, Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly.

The tendons in his arches exploded with sound. The unique steel-grey color of the Hundred Tempered Steel Body spiraled up from his knees.

Qi Huan felt a tightness at the back of his neck as a wave of energy, shrouded in dragon scale armor, lifted him onto a twenty-zhang-tall ancient tree. He quickly adjusted his posture and landed softly.

Xu Yunfan's figure landed beside him like a phantom, light and silent.

"Stay quiet."

The moment Xu Yunfan's five fingers dug into the tree trunk, the red mist eight hundred zhang away suddenly churned violently.

The entire mountain range heaved like a living creature. Magma-like liquid seeped from between the scale-like rock fissures. The stench of sulfur and blood rushed at them, causing Xu Yunfan to involuntarily hold his breath. The stray breath he took felt like a knife scraping his throat.

Qi Huan's blue scales stood on end, and his demonic pupils shrank to the size of pinpricks. He finally saw clearly what the so-called "mountain range" truly was.

A flood dragon's body, over a hundred zhang long, coiled into a nine-bend earth vein. Each red scale flowed with magma-like patterns. Bone spurs jutted from its spine, standing a zhang high, and the dark golden scabs at their tips refracted starlight under the sun.

Most terrifying was the dragon's head. Where the eyes should have been were two crater-like depressions. Boiling, lead-gray sludge flowed slowly down the nasal ridge.

Its scales were shattered in many places, making it look gruesome and terrifying. The sound of breathing that made the entire mountain heave came from this dragon's nostrils.

With every breath, a massive amount of spiritual mist was sucked in, turning into specks of starlight that merged with its body, slowly healing its injuries.

The terrifying pressure made the intense blood energy of the two men stagnate.

The two stared fixedly at the fierce flood dragon for a long time.

Finally, confirming that the dragon had no intention of moving, they relaxed slightly. Qi Huan sighed in admiration.

"So there really are flood dragons in this world. I thought they were just myths, yet here I am, seeing one in this small world secret realm!"

"What exactly happened to this flood dragon to suffer such a terrifying injury..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes shimmered with awe. His Adam's apple bobbed. The dragon scale armor on his body sensed the flood dragon's aura, causing the scales to slowly flutter and emit a humming sound.

The iron wood beneath his feet, harder than refined steel, suddenly cracked like a spiderweb. The sleeping fierce flood dragon merely turned over, and the ground within a hundred zhang radius heaved up like dough, creating a three-zhang-high wave of earth.

Qi Huan suddenly clutched his chest, black blood seeping from the gaps in his blue scales.

A pressure originating from his bloodline made his knees crackle under the strain, as if a thousand-pound anvil was pressing down on every bone.

"Retreat first!"

Xu Yunfan's low shout, infused with the Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength, shook Qi Huan out of his kneeling state.

The moment their toes left the ground, the ancient tree they had been hiding in was swallowed by subterranean fire.

Xu Yunfan's heart shook, and he subconsciously touched the dragon scale armor on his body.

This fierce flood dragon had definitely discovered them the moment they arrived.

Just then, boiling magma spewed from the ground, and a four-clawed energy shadow reached out from within. The rotting flesh stuck between the claws was clearly part of a Light Armor from the Sword Pavilion.

"Someone has been here!"

Qi Huan's voice was hoarse. As a demon, he was naturally suppressed by a higher-level demon beast, and he hadn't fully recovered yet, but his voice carried obvious delight.

His pupil, covered in blue scales, suddenly shrank into a vertical line. In the distance, a half截 ice-patterned sword floated in the lava pool. The frost flowers unique to the Sword Pavilion's "Nineteen Forms of Frost" were blooming strangely in the high heat.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted.

The breastplate of his dragon scale armor suddenly popped out three crescent moon scales. At the same time, seven sword qi pierced the air from the southwest.

Where the sword qi passed, the churning red mist actually froze into a waterfall of ice crystals, trapping the sulfur fire clouds spewed by the fierce flood dragon in mid-air.

"It's sword qi from the Green Bamboo Sword. The Sword Pavilion people, most likely Pei Yan. He's actually using the flood dragon to test his sword! It looks like quite a few Sword Pavilion disciples have died."

Qi Huan's voice carried a mix of amusement and disbelief, unsure if he was praising their bravery or mocking their ignorance.

"Die!"

Pei Yan's voice, mixed with ice shards, pierced their eardrums.

This Sword Pavilion traveler actually walked over the solidified magma. The Green Bamboo Sword in his hand emitted a three-chi frost radiance. Every step he took left a hexagonal ice flower on the ground.

His left sleeve was empty, and ice crystals had formed over the severed arm, with a few drops of blood frozen inside.

The fierce flood dragon suddenly raised its head and let out a series of sounds like metal clashing against stone.

In the crater-like eye sockets, the lead-gray sludge suddenly shot out, condensing in the air into nine magma dragons.

Pei Yan's Green Bamboo Sword suddenly burst forth with seven layers of frost rings. Where the sword tip pointed, the sword hummed. Under the superordinary attribute of the divine weapon, it utilized the Taiyi Light Splitting Sword to create seven phantom sword qi.

Xu Yunfan clearly saw the frost patterns on the sword spine refracting a Big Dipper star map under the reflection of the magma. Before the sword qi arrived, the demonic blue scales on Qi Huan, who was a hundred zhang away, had already begun to frost over.

Qi Huan's expression shook. It was hard to imagine that standing so far away, he was still affected by the sword qi.

Xu Yunfan beside him, however, acted as if nothing was happening. As the frost of the sword qi spread toward him, the scales of his dragon scale armor fluttered, and a breath of scorching heat blew it all away.

"Sword Divides the Big Dipper!"

In the roaring shout, the sword light turned into seven rivers of ice flowing upward.

Each magma dragon was pierced through the seven-inch point by the frost sword qi. The boiling dragon corpses froze into ice sculptures before they could hit the ground.

Pei Yan's expression was ferocious, his sword-like brows standing upright. Holding his sword with his single arm, he walked on ice, the tip of his sword pointing at the left eye crater of the fierce flood dragon. Where the cold light passed, it even froze the sulfur sludge into glass-like crystals.

The fierce flood dragon's mountain-like body suddenly trembled violently.

The bone spurs on its back stood upright like a thousand arrows shooting forth. The dark golden scabs at the tips exploded with a bang, turning into a sky full of fire meteors crashing into the sword light.

Pei Yan swung his sword, the frost blade weaving a hexagonal ice net in the air. However, the moment the fire meteors touched the ice net, the blood scabs inside suddenly split open, releasing thousands of golden threads!

"It looks like they're probably done for!"

Xu Yunfan's eyes were deep.

Those golden threads seemed to be the things trapping the fierce flood dragon, but now the dragon was forcibly stimulating them with its blood energy.

The ice net instantly vaporized into white mist, and Pei Yan had no time to change his move.

The fierce flood dragon's right claw suddenly plunged into the earth vein, and the entire red rock formation rolled up like a living creature.

The remains of the seven magma dragons actually reassembled in the earth and stone into赤 gold chains. The half截 Sword Pavilion Light Armor tied to the end suddenly exploded into a blood mist. It was clearly the remains of the Sword Pavilion disciples who had died in the dragon's belly earlier!
