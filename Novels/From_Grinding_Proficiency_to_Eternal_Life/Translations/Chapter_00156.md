# Chapter 156: The Taoist Observes the Mountain

Xu Yunfan immediately understood. Hong Baichuan had brought him here to add weight to the Heavenly Work Cave, to let the Xuanzhen Sect know that the Heavenly Work Cave had successors. Naturally, the other party would pay more attention.

Halfway up the mountain, the mist suddenly cleared.

A hundred zhang away, seven bronze pillars coiled with dragons rose from the ground. Atop the pillars, black iron chains crisscrossed like a net, locking a three-legged, two-eared cauldron.

The *taotie* patterns on the cauldron's body were inlaid with malachite. Under the sunlight, emerald light flowed, actually enveloping the entire mountain gate within the dense azure mist emanating from the cauldron.

"What a Mountain Suppressing Cauldron!"

Hong Baichuan clapped his hands in admiration. "I have heard that the Xuanzhen Sect's 'Cauldron Suppresses Mountains and Rivers' can verify the righteousness of the world and release the spiritual energy of all things. Today, I have truly broadened my horizons."

Although this Mountain Suppressing Cauldron was not quite a divine weapon, its material was extraordinary. Having received the worship of the Xuanzhen Sect day and night for a long time, it naturally produced a bit of divine power. Even in the era of spiritual dearth, with incense gathering and devout worship, it still had quite an effect.

Moreover, now that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth has appeared somewhat, this Mountain Suppressing Cauldron, which has existed for who knows how many years, might regain a fraction of its former power after being nurtured for a period of time.

Su Zhenhe lightly tapped his folding fan against his palm, smiling faintly. "Since Sect Leader Hong brought the 'Seven Luminaries of the Big Dipper Blades' from the Heavenly Work Armory's treasures to our doorstep, how could the Xuanzhen Sect dare to be negligent? The malachite sand burning in this cauldron is the best counter to metal and iron's killing intent."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow upon hearing this.

No wonder his blood and qi flowed more smoothly when he was climbing the mountain; it was the effect of this azure mist. If he stayed in this environment for a long time, his cultivation speed would increase by several points!

"Excellent blessed land!"

Hong Baichuan acted as if he hadn't noticed, turning to lift the iron box behind him.

Seven streams of cold light shot into the sky, arranging themselves like the Big Dipper above the cauldron. The edges of the blades trembled, sounding like dragon chants.

Silver fir charcoal from the bottom of the box rustled down, actually burning into seven lotus flowers in the azure mist!

Su Zhenhe's smile stiffened slightly.

The blades forged from North Sea Black Ice Iron were supposed to have their edge suppressed by the malachite sand. Yet, they used the residual heat of the charcoal to反催 fire energy, forcibly tearing open a gap in the array.

The rhythm of his knuckles tapping the fan was disrupted for a moment before returning to composure. "Sect Leader Hong has excellent skill and excellent weapons."

"A petty trick, how can it compare to the Xuanzhen Sect's heritage of thousands of years?"

Hong Baichuan's sleeve shook, and the seven blades returned to their case.

The bronze cauldron trembled violently, its feet sinking three inches into the ground.

No matter how divine the Mountain Suppressing Cauldron was, it was ultimately just a treasure artifact. This set of Seven Luminaries of the Big Dipper Blades was truly the Heavenly Work Cave's most treasured possession.

Xu Yunfan lowered his eyes to hide the brilliance within them.

The moment the blades left their case, he clearly saw the muscles on the back of Su Zhenhe's neck tense like a bowstring. If it weren't for the fact that this treasure artifact was in Hong Baichuan's hands, he probably wouldn't have been able to restrain himself from testing it out.

This true disciple of the Xuanzhen Sect ultimately couldn't hide the pride in his bones.

"Please."

Su Zhenhe stepped aside to make way. When he closed his folding fan, it brought forth a sharp sound, much like a sword sheathing its blade.

Xu Yunfan brushed past him. The fabric on his shoulder silently tore half an inch, cut by an invisible aura.

"Oh, Brother Xu, my apologies. I just got this folding fan a few days ago and can't yet control the invisible aura that leaks from it daily. I will send someone to bring you a change of clothes later."

"It's fine."

His gaze swept past his outer garment, his expression calm as he walked forward unhurriedly.

That aura couldn't break his defense.

Watching Xu Yunfan's back, Su Zhenhe's eyes flickered with a hint of surprise. He hadn't expected the other party to remain so unmoved.

No wonder he could ascend the mountain with Hong Baichuan.

Su Zhenhe pondered this, but seeing that they were almost at the mountain gate, he abandoned the thought in his mind.

A bell rang out suddenly from the mountain's peak.

Nine tolls of the bell dispersed the clouds and mist, revealing a white-bearded Taoist standing with his hands clasped behind his back by the mountain gate.

The green bricks beneath the elder's feet were cracked, and at the end of each crack was a sheathless iron sword, the black ribbons wrapped around the hilts fluttering like flags.

Xu Yunfan instinctively gripped his Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, his body tensing.

Hong Baichuan, however, seemed oblivious, looking at the Taoist before him with a smile.

It was the sect leader of Qingyue Xuanzhen Sect, the Mountain Observing Taoist.

Once the clouds and mist at the mountain gate had completely cleared, eight Taoists in green robes were already waiting by a thousand-year-old ginkgo tree by the roadside, arranged according to the Eight Trigrams. Iron swords stood like the Big Dipper.

The leading Taoist held a silver silk whisk. His frost-white eyebrows were heavy with morning dew. When he saw Hong Baichuan approaching, a smile also appeared.

His gaze swept over the corner of the box on Hong Baichuan's shoulder. The whisk suddenly pointed east, and in an instant, the mountain wind swept up the ginkgo leaves on the ground, condensing into three green dragons that charged straight at the wooden box.

"What excellent Supreme Unity Azure Energy!"

Hong Baichuan laughed and stepped onto the Xun position. His refined steel-like body-tempering technique made the copper locks on the box clang.

The next moment, a phoenix cry suddenly split the air from within the box, actually shredding the leaf-green dragons to pieces.

In the golden rain, the iron box crashed to the ground. When the lid flew open, the cold light was so intense it dimmed the stars. It was actually seven irregularly shaped blades of varying lengths, their edges arranged in the pattern of the Big Dipper. Upon closer inspection, they were forged from North Sea Black Ice Iron mixed with ginkgo charcoal. Each weapon's patterns were inlaid with malachite, a specialty of Lingnan, its emerald glow flowing like a living creature.

Beside him, Guan Hengzi, who was slightly older than the Mountain Observing Taoist, had his pupils contract. The silver threads of his whisk moved without wind. "Sect Leader Hong was actually able to fuse the Arctic Cold Iron with the South Fire Essence?"

"We used your sect's thousand-year-old ginkgo wood as charcoal and malachite as the medium, refining it in the Thunderfire Pool of my Heavenly Work Cave for seventy-seven days."

Hong Baichuan wiped the ice from his forehead, his laughter carrying a hint of imperceptible pain.

"Daoist Guanshan, this set of 'Seven Luminaries of the Big Dipper Blades' is perfectly suited to the essential principles of your sect's Big Dipper Array."

Another Daoist, Guan He, suddenly rose. His Taoist robes billowed like clouds.

Everyone saw the green light flow at his fingertips. The seven weapons seemed to come alive, drawing the trajectories of the Twenty-Eight Mansions in the air. When the final blade pierced the ginkgo tree trunk, the mist covering the mountain instantly condensed into sweet dew and fell.

With this move, Daoist Guan He's face was slightly flushed, but his eyes revealed unconcealed joy.

Ninth Stage of Qi Refining?!

Xu Yunfan's pupils contracted, but he quickly calmed down.

It was a bit different from the described Qi Refining. The green light at his fingertips was likely achieved by using some secret martial art combined with the five elements of his internal organs. A true Ninth Stage Qi Refiner wouldn't have to exert so much effort like him.

Seeing this, Hong Baichuan couldn't help but express surprise. "Daoist Guan He, are you perhaps already half a step into Qi Refining?"

Daoist Guan He shook his head with a bitter smile. "To be honest with Sect Leader Hong, this move of mine has already expelled the vital energy I had accumulated over three days. I've made a fool of myself now."

"Why be so modest?"

Hong Baichuan's face was full of emotion. "To this day, I have long been stuck at Marrow Cleansing with no further progress, but Daoist Guan He still has hope."

Daoist Guan He seemed to remember something and finally sighed. "If you hadn't suffered a serious injury back then, the Heavenly Work Cave would have at least produced a Viscera-refining Grandmaster. Perhaps you would have had a chance at Qi Refining. But Sect Leader Hong, don't lose heart. Now that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth has been stirred up by that Empress, there might be a chance for a reversal. Don't be disheartened."

After saying this, he couldn't help but glance at Guanshan.

Guan Shan's眼角 twitched. He naturally understood what his senior brother, Daoist Guan He, meant.
