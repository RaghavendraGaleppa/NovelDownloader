# Chapter 231: Dividing Pills  

Elder Ma's effortless mastery of pill refining filled Li Shiming with admiration. Achieving such a level would likely require years of dedicated practice.  

As usual, Li Shiming extended his spiritual sense into the cauldron. The refinement of the 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill' was naturally many times more difficult than previous pills. Through his spiritual sense, he could perceive Elder Ma continuously harmonizing the energies of the spiritual herbs within the cauldron using secret techniques.  

The energies inside the cauldron remained in a stable equilibrium. As time passed, the reactions grew increasingly intense, yet under Elder Ma's control, everything stayed within manageable limits.  

A single cauldron of pills took two hours to refine. Not only was Elder Ma refining two cauldrons simultaneously, but he also took the time to explain aspects of the 'Shushan Pill Canon' to Li Shiming.  

Through this session of refining the 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill,' Li Shiming gained a clearer understanding of what it meant to be a high-level alchemist.  

With a gentle tap of Elder Ma's spiritual sense on the artifact cauldron, a fragrant aroma wafted out.  

"A full cauldron of high-grade pills—Master, your skill is truly remarkable!" Li Shiming could judge the quality of the pills just by the scent and couldn't help but praise.  

Elder Ma smiled but said nothing, though inwardly, he sighed in relief. Having a disciple like Li Shiming came with its own pressures. Despite appearing relaxed, Elder Ma had exerted his full effort to ensure no mistakes were made.  

Even for a master alchemist, refining second-grade high-level pills wasn't a guaranteed success. A single lapse in concentration could lead to errors.  

Elder Ma placed the ten high-grade 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills' into a jade vial and handed it to Li Shiming.  

"Master, I'd like to refine a batch myself and ask for your guidance," Li Shiming said as he accepted the vial and stored it away.  

He took out his Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Cauldron and began his first attempt at refining a second-grade pill for mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Elder Ma divided part of his spiritual sense to observe Li Shiming's process. This wasn't an ordinary refinement. If Li Shiming succeeded in refining the 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill,' the sect would gain another high-level alchemist.  

Given Li Shiming's talent and his possession of spiritual fire, there was no doubt he would eventually become a master alchemist.  

The Crimson Sun Flame entered the Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Cauldron, and as Li Shiming executed the 'Spiritual Flame Control Technique,' he felt an even greater ease in manipulating the flame. The technique was specifically designed for spiritual fire, which explained his heightened control.  

One by one, the processed spiritual herbs were placed into the cauldron. Under the influence of the 'Thirty-Six Palm Pill Reversal Technique,' the herbs tumbled and mixed, transforming into pill liquid.  

Using the 'Green Emperor Sensing Technique,' Li Shiming monitored the state of the liquid inside the cauldron. With data collected by IBMz15 from Elder Ma's refinement process, he adjusted the energy balance within the cauldron.  

Beside him, Elder Ma stored away the pills he had just refined and focused entirely on Li Shiming's process. A pleased smile appeared on his face. Despite this being Li Shiming's first attempt at refining the 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill,' he maintained a flawless performance without a single mistake.  

As the pill liquid in the Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Cauldron grew denser, Li Shiming used his spiritual sense to form a hand that gently tapped the cauldron. With each tap growing stronger, the final strike caused the cauldron to open, releasing eight pills.  

"Ah!" Li Shiming sighed. This batch hadn't yielded a full cauldron, and only three were high-grade, with the rest being mid-grade.  

"Good enough. I'll assign you the sect's 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill' refinement task. With a few more attempts and some总结经验, you'll stabilize your output," Elder Ma said, waving his hand. He couldn't stand Li Shiming's dissatisfaction despite performing so well.  

By Li Shiming's standards, Elder Ma's other alchemy disciples would have been expelled long ago.  

"Thank you, Master!" Though disappointed, Li Shiming was still pleased. He bowed in gratitude.  

Elder Ma's words were an implicit acknowledgment of Li Shiming's status as a high-level alchemist, allowing him to take on high-level alchemy tasks for the sect.  

The 'Shushan Primordial Pill' he had refined earlier was a second-grade pill, but it contained only one second-grade herb. In contrast, the 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill' used five second-grade herbs, significantly increasing the difficulty.  

Within the Shushan Sect, Elder Ma was the only master alchemist, while there were four high-level alchemists.  

Though four might seem like a lot, considering the vast size of the sect and the hundreds of mid-to-late Foundation Establishment disciples, it was far from enough. Without Elder Ma's direct involvement, the demand for pills for mid-to-late-stage cultivators always outstripped supply, with every batch being quickly exchanged for contribution points.  

"Now that you've stepped into the realm of high-level alchemists, you'll likely receive requests from various connections within the sect. For at least a year, avoid accepting such commissions. An alchemist's reputation is crucial. While failures don't require compensation, they do damage credibility," Elder Ma advised.  

"I understand," Li Shiming nodded.  

Li Shiming accepted the task of refining one hundred batches of 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills' and returned to his cave abode.  

---  

After three refinements, Li Shiming stabilized his output of high-grade 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills' at a full cauldron. This achievement was thanks to both IBMz15's data on Elder Ma's refinements and the experience he had gained from a year of intensive pill refining.  

Once confident in his success rate, he attempted refining ten cauldrons of 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills' simultaneously.  

His confidence stemmed from IBMz15's assistance. Within the range of his spiritual sense, not only could he monitor all ten cauldrons, but IBMz15 also provided real-time alerts, ensuring any oversight was promptly corrected.  

Ten jade vials were filled with one hundred high-grade 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills.' Satisfied with his flawless performance, Li Shiming moved subsequent refinements into the machine room space.  

Ten artifact cauldrons lined the space, allowing him to collect 'Pill Essence' and refine top-grade 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills.' These would be essential once he advanced to mid-stage Foundation Establishment.  

By the time he had refined half of the hundred batches, refining mid-stage Foundation Establishment pills had become as effortless as refining the 'Shushan Primordial Pill.'  

Moreover, refining ten cauldrons at once drastically increased his speed. By the second day, he had refined nearly fifty batches and produced four top-grade 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills.'  

Still, Li Shiming wasn't satisfied. With IBMz15 and the micrometer-level precision of the machine room space, his achievements felt almost trivial.  

He turned his attention to the 'Hundred-to-One Pill Division Technique,' experimenting with it during each refinement.  

Within the machine room space, he had no fear of energy disturbances caused by the technique. His micrometer-level perception, combined with IBMz15's flawless monitoring, ensured any issues were detected and resolved instantly.  

His luck held. On the second day, the technique succeeded once. As he executed it, he focused intently on the cauldron's internal state.  

Inside the cauldron, as the pills took shape, a phantom pill shadow appeared beside them, voraciously absorbing spiritual energy. This phenomenon defied his understanding and nearly overwhelmed IBMz15.  

He had assumed the technique gathered excess pill liquid to form additional pills. Instead, it conjured pills from nothingness, materializing them through absorbed energy.  

When the batch was complete, he examined the twenty high-grade pills closely. One of the ten phantom-formed pills was tested thoroughly—every method confirmed it was a genuine high-grade 'Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill.'  

This inexplicable phenomenon underscored why the seemingly unreliable technique had been preserved in the 'Shushan Pill Canon.'  

Reviewing IBMz15's data, Li Shiming identified a fleeting, intricate pattern lasting only a hundredth of a second during the technique's activation. This pattern, composed of micrometer-scale particles, was the key to the technique's success.  

Without IBMz15's analysis, this ephemeral event would have gone unnoticed.  

Armed with this insight, Li Shiming began applying the technique to every refinement, doubling his output. One set of materials now yielded twenty pills, allowing him to amass vast reserves.  

Even more crucially, the output of top-grade pills also doubled.

While Li Shiming made breakthroughs in alchemy, his counterpart in the Senluo Sect, Li Yuanba, was also busy.  

Returning to the Ten Thousand Swords Peak, Li Yuanba met with Sword Elder.  

"Yuanba, it seems you avoided any danger this time?" Sword Elder asked with concern.  

After learning of Elder Lü's death in battle, Sword Elder had regretted sending Li Yuanba to the front lines.  

In such large-scale conflicts, Foundation Establishment cultivators were essentially cannon fodder, with heavy casualties being the norm.  

Of course, many also rose to prominence by securing resources in battle.  

But Elder Lü's death—a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator—had been unforeseen.  

"Master, I didn't even need to use the prayer beads you gave me," Li Yuanba replied with a smile.  

He wasn't lying. Sword Elder, however, couldn't have guessed that the real meaning was that he hadn't needed the beads because Elder Lü, restricted to Foundation Establishment-level strength, had been effortlessly killed by the 'High-Grade Magical Artifact Electromagnetic Cannon' before posing any real threat.  

Elder Lü might well be the most humiliatingly defeated mid-stage Golden Core cultivator in history.  

"Good. Your sword intent feels more solid—you've gained much from this experience," Sword Elder remarked, sensing Li Yuanba's progress.  

"Master, I encountered a Buddhist monk who moved between white lotuses with near-instantaneous speed. What technique was that?" Li Yuanba seized the chance to ask.  

His kill of Jueyuan Buddha was recorded in his military merits, so there was no need to hide it.  

"The 'Lotus Steps' of the Thousand Leaves Temple—an introductory technique to the Divine Foot Travel," Sword Elder explained with interest. "Divine Foot Travel is a heavenly rule-based technique typically mastered by Nascent Soul elders. Though 'Lotus Steps' is foundational, it brushes against the edges of such rules."
