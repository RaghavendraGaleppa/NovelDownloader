# Chapter 46: Talismans Clash with Spells  

Compared to his opponent's agitation, Lin Xuan appeared composed—at least on the surface. While trading talisman flames against the other's spells, he occasionally mixed in a sneak attack with an Ice Bullet Technique or something similar. Though these couldn't harm Yan Tianheng, they succeeded in infuriating him.  

Lin Xuan's expression was particularly provoking—his face filled with disdain, and he even taunted Yan Tianheng with a few mocking words from time to time. The Yan family head's face darkened further with each passing moment.  

It was no wonder. After all, he was the patriarch of a prominent family, a master of the seventh layer of cultivation. Yet, he couldn't do anything about a mere fourth-layer brat. The frustration gnawed at him.  

And that insufferably smug look on Lin Xuan's face—it was enough to drive a man mad.  

Was Lin Xuan truly this reckless?  

Of course not!  

He was doing this deliberately. It was common knowledge that acting rashly in battle would inevitably weaken one's combat effectiveness. Facing an opponent stronger than himself, victory would be extremely difficult to achieve. Not only did he need flawless strategy and tactics, but psychological warfare was also crucial.  

So Lin Xuan deliberately put on that infuriating act, provoking Yan Tianheng with words. And just as expected, the Yan family head lost his composure.  

This also proved Lin Xuan's sharp judgment. Though Yan Tianheng was ruthless and cunning—a true old fox—he had a fiery temper. Making him lose his cool wasn’t all that difficult.  

Everything Lin Xuan did was for the sake of victory. In truth, he was just as frustrated inside. After all, trading talismans against spells was painful—these were precious resources he had painstakingly gathered, and each one used was one less in his arsenal.  

What frustrated Lin Xuan even more was that using five low-grade talismans at a time like this was incredibly wasteful.  

Five low-grade talismans could just barely counter one of Yan Tianheng’s mid-grade spells. So far, Lin Xuan had already used thirty. If he could have activated all thirty at once instead of in batches, he would have long since reduced his opponent to ashes.  

But that was just wishful thinking. The reason was simple—activating low-grade talismans still required spiritual energy. With Lin Xuan’s current cultivation level, he could only use five at a time before needing a short break to recover. Though the interval was brief—just two or three seconds—that tiny delay made all the difference.  

Because in that time, Yan Tianheng could cast another mid-grade spell, turning the battle into a war of attrition. It now boiled down to who would exhaust their resources first—Yan Tianheng’s spiritual energy or Lin Xuan’s talismans.  

In truth, there was a way to activate more than five talismans at once. Lin Xuan had once read about it in a book—it required refining the talismans again, linking them together using a rare treasure called Spirit-Guiding Grass.  

To put it simply, it was like firecrackers. They could be lit one by one, or strung together with a fuse so that lighting it once would set them all off at the same time. The Spirit-Guiding Grass acted as that fuse—by using it to link talismans, dozens or even hundreds could be activated simultaneously.  

Lin Xuan had stockpiled so many low-grade talismans precisely because he intended to seek out Spirit-Guiding Grass later. But who would have thought he’d encounter an enemy so soon? These talismans hadn’t been refined yet, so he had no choice but to use them five at a time.  

Thus, while Lin Xuan was inwardly distressed and frustrated, outwardly, he maintained an air of nonchalance and confidence—a crucial psychological tactic in battle.  

At the same time, Lin Xuan was thinking that this couldn’t go on. Though Yan Tianheng’s spiritual energy had weakened considerably, it was still far from exhaustion. Was he really going to have to outlast him in this battle of attrition?  

Meanwhile, Yan Tianheng was also growing uneasy. Initially, he had thought capturing a mere fourth-layer brat would be effortless. But now, he was no longer so sure. Just how many talismans did this kid have? If things continued like this, his own spiritual energy would be depleted first.  

But on the other hand, this kid was absurdly wealthy—his resources surpassed even those of Foundation Establishment experts. Considering he had once traded a mid-grade pill for a cultivation technique, if he had one, it wasn’t impossible for him to have another.  

If he could obtain a mid-grade pill, his chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment would greatly increase. At this thought, a greedy glint flashed in Yan Tianheng’s eyes, and he licked his lips. It seemed he had no choice but to use that treasure.  

He unleashed another mid-grade spell while reinforcing his spiritual energy shield, making it even more solid. Then, he reached into his robes.  

Lin Xuan frowned, a shadow crossing his face. Seeing Yan Tianheng’s movements, he knew his opponent was about to unleash something formidable.  

Lin Xuan had no intention of letting him act unhindered. He could no longer afford to be frugal—without hesitation, he flung out two mid-grade talismans he had obtained from Zhang Yu. One countered the Firebird Technique, while the other transformed into a massive curved blade that slashed down at Yan Tianheng.  

Since his next move required his full concentration, Yan Tianheng had no choice but to endure the Metal-Attribute Blade Technique bearing down on him.  

**BOOM!**  

The power of a mid-grade spell was incomparable to the earlier Fireball Technique. The sheer force of its collision with the spiritual energy shield was staggering.  

Dust billowed into the air, and the ground was carved with a deep trench. After taking the hit, Yan Tianheng’s face turned deathly pale, and a trickle of blood seeped from the corner of his mouth. Yet Lin Xuan inwardly cursed—if only the attack had been slightly stronger. Though the blade technique had wounded Yan Tianheng, it still hadn’t broken through his shield.  

**"Brat, to force me to this point… you’ve done well. But now, you can die!"**  

Before the dust had even settled, Yan Tianheng’s venomous voice rang out, filled with chilling malice. Lin Xuan tensed, channeling spiritual energy to his fingertips while gripping another talisman in his other hand.  

But he didn’t act recklessly. Making a rash move when the situation was unclear would be foolish. He needed to see what his opponent had prepared before deciding his next step.  

Though wary, Lin Xuan felt not an ounce of fear. Yan Tianheng might have a trump card, but so did he—the Ice Needle Technique and the Golden Binding Rope remained unused. Even if his opponent was a peak-level expert, victory in a battle between cultivators wasn’t determined by cultivation alone. Artifacts, talismans—they all played a decisive role.
