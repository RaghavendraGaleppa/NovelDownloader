# Chapter 12: I Just Disguised My Sword as a Hammer

The sudden appearance of Physician Xue from the black wooden coffin caught Xiao Ji off guard. Currently, his perception range was limited to just one zhang (about three meters), making him no different from an ordinary person beyond that distance. At his current cultivation level, unexpected situations were bound to occur.

Physician Xue floated out of the coffin and landed steadily on the ground.

"You didn't go out to practice medicine?" Xiao Ji was surprised by this development. The information he'd obtained from the acolytes at the Child-Giving Temple had clearly indicated Physician Xue was away. Yet here he was. The only explanation was that Physician Xue had deliberately misled his disciples, hiding in the secret chamber to cultivate. Any disciple who dared enter would be caught immediately.

"Those useless disciples of mine can't even keep visitors out. Looks like I'll need to replace them again," Physician Xue muttered to himself, ignoring Xiao Ji's question. His demeanor was erratic, bordering on madness. "I will achieve immortality—no one can stop me. But just as I was about to break through, you two had to disturb me. Perfect timing—I need cultivators' hearts to refine a special medicine. Come quickly, into my bowl!"

As he spoke, he placed a bloodstained large bowl on the filthy altar. "Hurry up and place your hearts in the bowl. Why hesitate?"

Xiao Ji and Zhao Jiuzhou: "..."

They were at a loss for words.

It was clear Physician Xue had succumbed to qi deviation, his consciousness eroded by dark thoughts, leading to his deranged behavior. His condition fluctuated between lucidity and madness, making him highly unpredictable and dangerous. One moment he might try to kill you, the next he might engage in casual conversation.

Zhao Jiuzhou shook the small hammer in his hand, and it transformed into a sword.

Xhao Ji frowned at the sudden change, puzzled. When he had sensed Zhao Jiuzhou earlier, he hadn't focused on his weapon, only the man himself.

"I just disguised my sword as a hammer," Zhao Jiuzhou explained.

"What's the point?" Xiao Ji found it rather pointless.

"It catches people off guard. When I swing what looks like a hammer, my opponent prepares to defend against a blunt weapon—only to be met with a sharp blade. Unpredictable," Zhao Jiuzhou said with confidence.

"But you've just revealed your secret. Physician Xue will surely be on guard now. You should have kept that trick hidden a little longer," Xiao Ji shook his head slightly.

"No matter," Zhao Jiuzhou stepped forward, thrusting his sword at Physician Xue with swift precision. "Because in truth—it's a spear! Duan De, die!"

As the sword tip neared Physician Xue, it suddenly elongated into a gleaming silver spear, its momentum fierce.

Xiao Ji didn't know what expression to make at this point. He quickly sidestepped to the right.

In the next instant, Zhao Jiuzhou was forced back by Physician Xue's silver needles, flipping backward and landing unsteadily. Xiao Ji caught him.

"Thanks," Zhao Jiuzhou muttered, wondering how Xiao Ji always seemed to be in the right place at the right time.

"Don't mention it," Xiao Ji replied with a perfunctory smile.

Physician Xue, now calm again, retracted his silver needles and addressed Zhao Jiuzhou's sudden attack. "That counts as a sneak attack, doesn't it? One should at least explain themselves before killing. I'm a physician who saves lives, after all... And as I said earlier, my name isn't Duan De. It's Xue."

This was the same man who, moments ago, had demanded their hearts for his medicine.

Zhao Jiuzhou kept his gaze fixed on Physician Xue. "I don't care what your original surname was. I know you once went by Duan De and incited strife within the Profound Iron Sect, leading to its downfall. And look at this place—you murdered seven Taoist priests from the Child-Giving Temple. No matter what, you deserve death."

"Hahaha... The Profound Iron Sect's internal conflict was just a few words from me. I didn't kill anyone directly—only those who sought my life or tried to steal from me. Blame their greed and stupidity," Physician Xue retorted. "As for those seven priests, do you even know what they did? They conspired to murder their own master to obtain a dark cultivation manual, using infant spirits to prolong their lives. I merely took over their operation."

"Within thirty miles, there are seventeen villages. The ignorant villagers only knew the Child-Giving Temple was effective, unaware of the priests' sinister motives. They meticulously managed the temple for one purpose—to harvest the unborn children from these villages."

"If a woman carried a single fetus, they'd ensure a smooth birth, even aiding the sick to conceive quickly. Whether the parents wanted a boy or girl, the priests could manipulate the outcome—all to attract more desperate couples."

"But if they detected twins, they'd secretly extract one to refine into infant spirits."

"So tell me—did they not deserve to die? You who claim righteousness—do you still seek vengeance for them?"

This revelation was unexpected. When Xiao Ji had been upstairs, he'd only gathered surface-level information. Now, standing more than three zhang away from the seven priests in the medicinal baths, he couldn't verify the story immediately—though he soon would.

Regardless, this had nothing to do with killing Physician Xue.

Xiao Ji had initially thought the place was empty—he'd planned to take the single-stringed pipa and leave. But Physician Xue had never left the temple; he'd been hiding underground all along.

"You disturbed my cultivation! You deserve death!" Physician Xue's mood shifted again, his madness resurfacing.

This erratic behavior made it difficult for Xiao Ji to predict his next moves.

"Fellow Daoist Zhao, this sinister physician is at the fifth level of Qi Refining. Both of us are at the fourth level—don't underestimate him," Xiao Ji warned.

"No wonder that needle was so fierce earlier... But when he left the Profound Iron Sect, he was only at the first level of Qi Refining. How did he advance so quickly?" Zhao Jiuzhou was skeptical. "And how did you know I'm at the fourth level?"

"Don't dwell on trivial details. Let's deal with him first," Xiao Ji said, positioning himself for an optimal strike. "Engage him directly."

They had only met tonight. What if this Taoist was sending him to his death while planning to escape? After a brief hesitation, Zhao Jiuzhou chose to trust Xiao Ji—if only because of his otherworldly demeanor.

"Take this!" Zhao Jiuzhou lunged forward, his spear aimed straight for Physician Xue's forehead.

This time, his weapon didn't transform.

Zhao Jiuzhou was, after all, a spearman.

Physician Xue flicked out a silk thread, entangling the spear, then launched three silver needles with a snap of his fingers. Simultaneously, he tossed pills toward the seven priests in the baths.

Xiao Ji felt exhausted. When Physician Xue was incoherent, he could predict his movements—like charging at Zhao Jiuzhou to bite him. But now, with his mind clear, Physician Xue fought methodically, instantly reversing the disadvantage and even finding time to feed pills to the corpses.

Once ingested, those pills would allow Physician Xue to control the priests—they'd been refined into medicinal puppets.

Xiao Ji moved swiftly. Drawing his sword, he dashed toward the priests, slicing the pills midair before they could enter the corpses' mouths. With precise strikes, he beheaded all seven to prevent further tricks.

His actions were so rapid that both Zhao Jiuzhou and Physician Xue froze momentarily.

Seeing his carefully cultivated medicinal puppets destroyed, Physician Xue's despair tipped him back into madness. He turned on Xiao Ji with a furious lunge, his three silver needles curving midair to follow.

The situation had suddenly become far more perilous.
