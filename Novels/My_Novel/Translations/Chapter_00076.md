Chapter 76: The Blood Palm Arrives at the Gates, The Mistress Summons Me

“Truly, they say you’re a good man, Master.”

“He’s just a useless old man, yet you treat him with such respect. You’re giving him too much face.”

They left the manor at noon and returned as evening was drawing to a close.

Li Xian led the way, holding a torch in hand. The group of guards, having heard rumors of ghosts, felt a chill in their hearts.

The weather was bitterly cold, and the Yin energy was already at its peak.

To pass the time and relieve the boredom, they began to chat.

“Bullying the weak is not my way,” Li Xian said. “If you wish to advance further in the martial path, you must adjust your mindset. Those who bully the weak will be bullied by others; only those who strive for self-improvement can truly become strong.”

“Yes, yes, Master Li is absolutely right.”

The guards agreed repeatedly.

Li Xian glanced at them and knew that no one had taken his words to heart. But he didn't mind and continued to lead the way. They turned onto a mountain path where the trees were dense, making it difficult to walk at night.

Branches reached out, blocking the way above their heads. Li Xian drew his blade and slashed them away, scattering the twigs on the ground.

At this time, it was difficult for common folk to gather firewood.

A single fire was hard to come by, so even these small twigs and leaves would be secretly picked up and saved. Li Xian had lived through such times, so he swung his blade freely, not minding leaving more scattered branches behind.

“By the way, do you think there are really ghosts in this world?”

From behind, a guard, perhaps thinking of the events in the East Farm Village, suddenly asked.

“Ghosts?”

“Of course there are. If demons exist, how could ghosts be missing?”

“Let me tell you, not to mention other places, but right here in our manor, there have been ghosts!”

The guards began to chatter. Li Xian was also interested and asked, “Oh? There were really ghosts?”

Hearing Li Xian’s question, the guards became even more enthusiastic. One of them said, “It wasn't just a rumor, it was terrifying.”

“It's said that after a person dies, if their vengeful spirit doesn't dissipate, there's a chance it can turn into a ghost.”

“Some come for your life, some for your wealth, all kinds of strange things.”

“Master Li, if you're interested, I can tell you all about them one by one.”

As they were speaking...

Li Xian was feeling quite curious when he suddenly frowned, sensing something amiss. He said in a low, stern voice, “Something's not right.”

“Master, what's not right?” The guards immediately panicked, fearing that ghosts were at play.

However, the说法 of ghosts and monsters in the world has never been certain. The things that cause the most trouble are, and always will be, people.

Li Xian lowered his torch and said, “Look.”

On the ground were dozens of footprints of varying depths, and among them, a cart track was particularly conspicuous.

And these tracks were freshly made.

They hadn't seen any ghosts, but there were plenty of human traces.

“A group of people, making a grand entrance under the cover of night, heading for the manor.”

“And they aren't carrying any lights, traveling in the dark. They must be up to no good. Those with good intentions don't act this way.”

Li Xian's mind raced. He quickly lowered the torch and extinguished it with dirt.

“Ah, Master, why did you put out the fire?”

“We can't see anything now!” the guards exclaimed in alarm.

“Quiet,” Li Xian said sternly.

The group immediately fell silent, not daring to make a sound.

“There's trouble in the manor,” Li Xian muttered. He pointed to a small path and said, “If we take the main road, we'll likely run right into them. We'll take a detour back via the small path.”

The night was pitch black, and the small path was secluded. The way was even harder to travel, and the guards were unwilling, but how could they dare to object?

Seeing that Li Xian had already taken the lead and stepped onto the small path, they could only follow. Even if they had complaints, they didn't dare to voice them.

Li Xian ran and sprinted. Three-quarters of an hour later, he emerged from the woods and entered the manor through the east side gate.

The manor covered a vast area, with gates on all four sides: east, west, south, and north. The south gate was the main entrance, and each gate was extremely far apart, not connected in the slightest.

Li Xian's hearing was exceptionally sharp, and he faintly heard some commotion. There was trouble at the main gate.

He immediately went to Pang Long's courtyard. Seeing no lights in the courtyard, he knew Pang Long had already rushed to the front gate. He then went to the guards' dormitory, which was also empty.

“It seems these visitors are extremely hostile!”

Li Xian frowned, tightened his grip on his blade, and felt an ominous premonition. After a moment of hesitation, he took a rarely known path toward the main gate.

He concealed his figure, hiding in the shadows.

Finally, he could see the situation clearly.

He saw the manor's vermilion main gate, which had been split into four pieces by two slashes. The cuts were smooth, as if slicing through tofu, showing that the person who broke the gate had extremely profound skill.

He also saw that there were quite a few people outside the gate. They weren't holding torches, so he couldn't see their exact number. But from the commotion, there had to be many.

*Boom!*

*Boom!*

*Boom!*

Thunderous drumbeats exploded in the night, disturbing everyone's sleep.

Pang Long's expression was grim. He channeled his Qi and roared, “Who dares to beat the drums? Do you have a death wish?”

The sound waves rolled forth, momentarily overpowering the drumming and forcing the drummer back several steps.

“It is I, Zheng Xuezhang, who beats the drums!” an even louder, furious shout replied.

Zheng Xuezhang took a great stride forward, making a formal entrance. He was a burly man with a full beard, radiating an overbearing aura, and a long blade as tall as a person was strapped to his back.

Li Xian secretly pondered, “Is he here for me?” His heart tightened. He remained hidden, but he didn't regret killing Zheng Caiqi. That man was narrow-minded; whether killed or not, he would have brought endless trouble.

“If the situation turns bad, I'll run immediately,” Li Xian thought, grateful to be in the shadows, holding his breath and observing.

“Zheng Xuezhang, your Blackwater Gang is going too far!” Pang Long cursed angrily.

Zheng Xuezhang retorted, “It is you who have gone too far!” He glanced sideways and saw a manor guard beside him. Filled with rage, he didn't bother with formalities. He reached out, grabbed the guard, broke his limbs, and threw him out the gate like a dead pig.

“You!”

Pang Long was furious. This man had first broken the gate and then attacked his people.

“You use the water from my Blackwater Gang, and yet you dare to secretly harm my son. Today, I will tear this place apart until you can't even live in peace.”

“Where is Li Xian? Get the hell out here!”

As Zheng Xuezhang spoke, he attacked another guard. Using a capture technique, he targeted the guard, who was at the B-level. But before such a master, he was as fragile as a clay chicken or a mud dog.

The guard was so terrified he couldn't move, about to be captured.

Pang Long roared, unable to just stand by and watch. He immediately stepped forward, threw the guard behind him, and slapped his palm toward Zheng Xuezhang.

“Here you come!”

Zheng Xuezhang turned his claw into a palm, meeting Pang Long head-on. The two palms met with a *bang*. Snow and dust flew up at their feet, swirling around them.

Pang Long poured all his strength into the attack. The firelight shone on him, and a colorful glow appeared on his shoulders.

“Some skill. Half-step to Food Essence?” Zheng Xuezhang could still speak, and in this single palm strike, the difference in their strength was already clear.

“Hmph!”

He let out a cold snort and flicked his left hand. The swirling snow and dust shot toward the side with more people. The force was immense, blowing over a dozen guards and sending them tumbling.

Pang Long was already struggling to hold on.

He channeled his Qi throughout his body, surging it into his palm. “Hah!” He let out another roar, adding his other palm to the attack, barely managing to stand his ground against Zheng Xuezhang.

“Overestimating your own abilities,” Zheng Xuezhang said. He gave a slight shake, and a layer of blood mist suddenly erupted from his body.

His strength and internal Qi instantly surged several times over. This was the “Blood Wheel Technique,” a powerful martial art of the Entry Level. In an instant, he blasted Pang Long back, forcing him to one knee as he spat out several mouthfuls of blood.

Pang Long mustered his strength and said, “You dog, for trespassing the manor's gates, take this!” He paid no more mind to anything else and unleashed his signature move, the “Red Ridge Long Fist.”

Once this fist technique was unleashed, it was like Mount Tai crashing down, its momentum surging. Yet it wasn't just a straightforward charge; it possessed the flexibility of an eighteen-turn mountain path.

Qi is originally an intangible thing. But when manifested through martial arts, it becomes visible to the naked eye and full of mystical wonder.

The two exchanged several moves. Each move was shocking, and every punch and kick carried immense force. Zheng Xuezhang was a Food Essence expert, so he naturally had the upper hand against Pang Long.

Pang Long gathered his momentum and threw a ferocious punch. Zheng Xuezhang remained calm and said, “Let's see how you handle this move!” He turned his back, exposing his back to the attack.

Pang Long's fist struck his back. Zheng Xuezhang stomped his foot, and a rebounding force shot out.

A series of *cracking* sounds were heard as the bones in Pang Long's right hand shattered. He let out a painful, agonizing cry.

Zheng Xuezhang laughed heartily.

This was, of course, for revenge for his son.

But it was also a test of the One Union Manor's depth. If their strength was shallow... he would swallow them whole.

“I hear you have a mistress?”

“Have her come see me!”

Zheng Xuezhang was victorious and in the height of his pride.
