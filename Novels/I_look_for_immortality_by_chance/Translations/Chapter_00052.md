# Chapter 52: The Azurewater Ape and the Fiery Eye Pill  

"Hmm?"  

"Not good!"  

Gu Yuan's heart skipped a beat.  

At this moment, he was still concealed within the Void Jade's effect—only cultivators at the ninth level of Qi Refinement could potentially see through his presence. Yet, an attack had just been launched at him. Could it be a bandit cultivator at the ninth level?  

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan activated his Cloud Radiance Robe, causing streams of radiant light to cascade down and shield him. Simultaneously, the Eight Winds Ring vibrated intensely, ready to immobilize any incoming magical artifacts.  

However, there were no artifacts in the air—nothing for the Eight Winds Ring to lock onto.  

Nor did the Cloud Radiance Robe manage to fully protect him.  

The "barrier" in the air wasn't aimed at Gu Yuan himself, but rather at the ten-zhang radius around him.  

It was as if an invisible prison had sealed off this small patch of the world.  

Within Gu Yuan's dantian, several spell seals hummed in warning, vigilantly scanning their surroundings.  

"Hahaha, no need to look around! This is my clan's unique 'Water Prison Heavenly Seal'—it can seal off a ten-zhang area and conceal any traces of battle. Unless your cultivation surpasses mine by a full major realm, the only way out is to kill me!"  

Just as Gu Yuan was warily surveying his surroundings, a booming voice suddenly echoed through the water.  

Then, with a surge of waves, a six-foot-tall ape with emerald-green fur, a blue tail, and golden pupils emerged from the water.  

"Azurewater Fiery-Eyed Ape!"  

Gu Yuan couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.  

The one ambushing him was actually an Azurewater Fiery-Eyed Ape!  

These apes weren't native to the Scarlet Moon Great River—why was one here?  

Wasn't it afraid of being hunted down by the Dao Academy's experts?  

Wait—no. True Azurewater Fiery-Eyed Apes had golden eyes that shimmered with divine light, like blazing suns. This ape's eyes, though golden, lacked that radiance. It must be of impure bloodline, not a true Azurewater Fiery-Eyed Ape.  

Seemingly reading the meaning in Gu Yuan's gaze, the ape flew into a rage.  

"Impure bloodline or not, I can still kill you!" it roared.  

"Brat, hand over the Fiery Eye Pill and your storage bag now, and I might spare your life!"  

"Otherwise, I'll tear you to pieces and ensure you never reincarnate!"  

It glared at Gu Yuan with intense fury.  

By now, Gu Yuan had already calmed down.  

Azurewater Fiery-Eyed Apes were a rare species, born with the cultivation of the third level of Qi Refinement. After about ten years of growth, they could reach the sixth level, and another ten years would bring them to the ninth. A pure-blooded Azurewater Fiery-Eyed Ape could even reach Foundation Establishment strength in just twenty years.  

Adult Azurewater Fiery-Eyed Apes were almost always at the late Foundation Establishment stage, with the strongest even reaching the Golden Core realm.  

But this impure-blooded ape before him, regardless of how long it had lived, was only around the seventh level of Qi Refinement. Gu Yuan's mind settled.  

Hearing the ape's demands, however, Gu Yuan frowned.  

"The Fiery Eye Pill?"  

"I don't have it. You must have been deceived—don't throw your life away for nothing."  

The Fiery Eye Pill had just appeared at the auction, but Gu Yuan hadn't purchased it. Why would this ape target him?  

A sense of conspiracy crept into his thoughts.  

He had initially suspected disciples of the Falling Clouds Sect might ambush him, but instead, he was facing an impure-blooded Azurewater Fiery-Eyed Ape over a pill he didn't even possess.  

"Hah! Do you think I don’t know who supplied that Fiery Eye Pill?" the ape sneered.  

"That pill was sold by me! The materials used to refine it came from my mother’s eyes. I can sense its aura even through a storage bag—you can’t fool me!"  

"Hand it over now, along with your storage bag, and I’ll spare you. Otherwise, you’ll die for nothing!"  

With a cold laugh, the ape brandished a blue steel trident, its gaze fixed greedily on the storage bag at Gu Yuan’s waist.  

Its mother’s eyes?  

The Fiery Eye Pill had been sold by this very ape?  

But Gu Yuan had never bought it—why was he being framed?  

Was someone setting him up?  

Or was this ape simply using it as an excuse to rob and kill?  

Gu Yuan’s thoughts raced as he pieced together the puzzle.  

"I don’t have the Fiery Eye Pill. There must be some misunderstanding."  

"If you release this seal, we can work together to uncover the truth."  

His tone softened slightly, attempting to pacify the ape.  

"Fine, then toss me your storage bag for inspection!" the ape scoffed.  

Gu Yuan sighed, his expression turning cold.  

"Very well. Since this is a setup, the mastermind likely isn’t overwhelmingly strong. I’ll deal with you first, then find them."  

Handing over his storage bag would be foolish—he had no intention of doing so.  

"Arrogant fool…"  

The ape sneered and lunged forward, trident raised.  

But in an instant, thick fog enveloped the area.  

Within a ten-zhang radius, mist and torrential rain obscured everything, suppressing all perception and spells.  

*Clang!*  

A golden ring shot through the fog, locking onto the ape’s trident.  

The inscribed patterns on the trident flickered briefly before dimming, as if reduced to mere scrap metal.  

The ape’s face twisted in shock.  

This fog and the ring’s power were far more formidable than it had anticipated.  

"I’ve bitten off more than I can chew!"  

Panic surged within the ape, but its expression only grew fiercer.  

"So what? Brat, today you’ll witness my clan’s divine technique!"  

Taking a deep breath, it channeled its demonic energy, causing its golden pupils to glow intensely.  

Though its bloodline was impure, it still possessed half the heritage of its rare lineage. At full power, it could activate the Fiery Eye Technique.  

And the Fiery Eye Pill required the scorching sun’s flames to be consumed—this human hadn’t had the chance yet.  

Victory was still possible!  

*Poof!*  

As demonic energy swirled, the gold in its eyes grew brighter.  

*Boom!*  

But then, thunder rumbled within the fog.  

A blinding bolt of lightning struck its forehead.  

*Crash!*  

Staggering, the light in its eyes dimmed.  

"Top-grade magical artifact!"  

"Damn it!"  

It roared in frustration.  

Though its trident appeared unremarkable, it was forged from rare river steel, capable of harnessing the power of the Azurewater River. If not for the ring’s suppression, it would have been a top-grade artifact, providing crucial defense while it activated its technique.  

Without the trident, it had lost a vital safeguard.  

*Whoosh!*  

Just as it steeled itself to endure the lightning and reignite its power, a silver beam descended from above.  

"This is…?"  

It didn’t recognize the beam, but its demonic energy, vitality, and spiritual sense instantly weakened—as if it were withering away like its mother had before death.  

"Another top-grade artifact?!"  

Despite its hybrid resilience, only a top-grade artifact could inflict such debilitating effects.  

A wave of dread washed over it.  

This time, it had truly provoked someone far beyond its league.  

*Sssshhk!*  

Yet, before it could react, a force like molten lava pierced through the fog and impaled its skull, extinguishing all thought.  

*Crack!*  

The invisible seal shattered, revealing the open world once more.  

A handsome young man, watching the broken water seal from a distance, froze mid-smile.
