# Chapter 13: Lightly Polishing the Long Sword

"One pill every morning, continuously for seven days. Grind this herb into a powder, ignite it, and it will help the injured recover faster," Song Miu instructed, taking out the medicinal ingredients.

"Thank you, Physician. This is your consultation fee, please accept it!"

Seeing their big brother's injuries improve, the surrounding men were all in high spirits, with no trace of their earlier sinister murderous intent. How could Song Miu dare to accept money from these people? He waved his hands repeatedly.

Finally, Song Miu couldn't resist Jian Liang's enthusiasm and hesitantly accepted one tael of silver. The smiles on the faces of the surrounding men grew wider, and they no longer pressed Song Miu to accept the other consultation fees.

Chen Fei watched from the side, a slight chill in his heart. It was fortunate that Song Miu understood the ways of the world. If he had really accepted all the consultation fees just now, their heads would likely be forfeit.

These people might seem generous, but how could they truly give money away so freely, even if it was for a medical fee?

Walking out of the room and into the main hall, they found Pu Liao lying unconscious on the ground.

"This fellow tried to escape just now, so the brothers caught him back and broke one of his legs," someone beside Jian Liang said.

Jian Liang's eyebrows twitched, and he looked at Chen Fei and Song Miu with a half-smile before cupping his hands. "The brothers were a bit heavy-handed and injured him. Why don't we give this brother some silver so he can go back and properly treat his injuries?"

"No, no, we wouldn't dare!"

"What happened?!" Zhang Sinan frowned, looking at Pu Liao's broken leg. Even if it were healed, he wouldn't be able to walk normally again.

"We encountered a den of mountain bandits, alas..."

Now that they were here, Song Miu finally let out a sigh of relief and recounted everything that had happened. As he spoke, the listeners grew increasingly apprehensive.

One could imagine that if Song Miu's medical skills had been poorer, or if he hadn't had the healing pill, or even if he had been a little greedy, he might have been decapitated by now.

"These mountain bandits are incredibly audacious! I'll report this to the county yamen and have them apprehended!" Zhang Sinan declared coldly, turning to head back into the county. Cui Sanjie quickly stepped forward and whispered a few words to Zhang Sinan. Zhang Sinan's expression flickered, but he said nothing, simply continuing forward.

Chen Fei took a few deep breaths. This matter would probably end up unresolved. The county yamen wouldn't concern itself with affairs outside Pingyin County, and the Zhang family, in all likelihood, would also pretend it hadn't happened.

No one died, so wasn't everything fine?

Just as Chen Fei expected, the Zhang family didn't publicize the incident. Afterward, they merely compensated Chen Fei and the other two with some silver as a gesture of solace. Pu Liao received a bit more compensation, as he had lost a leg.

Zeng Defang shook his head, picked up a chicken foot, and tossed it into his mouth.

"Then how can the Zhang family agree?" Chen Fei pressed, "With my current earning speed, if I were to buy the Grass Reversion Pills myself for cultivation, I'd probably run into financial difficulties."

"Become a live-in son-in-law."

Zeng Defang smiled and glanced at Chen Fei. "However, you no longer have the chance. All the Zhang family's young ladies have already married. But besides becoming a live-in son-in-law, there is another way: rendering meritorious service to the Zhang family."

"Please enlighten me, Elder Zeng," Chen Fei said, cupping his hands.

"Your talent is good, and the Zhang family has noticed it. I'll ask about it for you tomorrow and then let you know."
