# Chapter 2: The Spirit Hoe - The Second Equipment  

Dawn.  

The golden crow had just risen, its first rays piercing through the clouds and slipping through the window cracks to land on Zhang Yan, bathing him in a radiant glow. He looked almost divine, like an immortal descended to the mortal realm.  

His eyelashes fluttered as he opened his eyes, exhaling a turbid breath. His gaze seemed even brighter than before.  

"A whole night of practice, and I’ve only gained a wisp of spiritual energy. Who knows how long it’ll take before I truly reach the Qi Refining stage." Despite cultivating all night, Zhang Yan didn’t feel the slightest bit tired. On the contrary, he felt refreshed and invigorated.  

Especially when he sensed that faint, warm current of energy circulating within his body—it made him even more excited.  

Qi Refining cultivation.  

To step into the Qi Refining stage, one needed to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, refine it into spiritual power, and then use it to unblock the body’s meridians. The human body had twelve major meridians. Each meridian unblocked would bring a significant boost in strength.  

Once all twelve meridians were opened, one would reach the Great Perfection of Qi Refining. And because all twelve meridians were connected throughout the body, the strength of such a cultivator far surpassed that of ordinary Qi Refining practitioners.  

At present, Zhang Yan had already achieved the stage of refining Qi into threads. Based on his current progress, in less than half a year, he might very well become a true Qi Refining cultivator.  

**Knock, knock, knock.**  

Just as he was lost in thought, a knocking sound came from the door.  

"Time to get to work!"  

"Coming!"  

Hearing Old Lin’s voice, Zhang Yan immediately got up, straightened his clothes, and walked out.  

"Today, you’ll be responsible for hoeing and weeding."  

Old Lin was still wearing that tattered Daoist robe. Though he was smiling, the deep wrinkles on his face made his expression seem somewhat unpleasant.  

"Yes, Elder Lin." Zhang Yan nodded in acknowledgment.  

Though he and Old Lin were nominally both disciples of the Spirit Herb Garden, with no distinction in rank, in reality, Zhang Yan had to follow Old Lin’s orders. Otherwise, he might not even earn a single spirit stone. His only alternative would be to wait until he reached the Qi Refining stage, apply for a spirit field, and grow spirit rice to earn spirit stones.  

For now, working under Old Lin might be tiring, but it allowed him to earn some spirit stones while also gaining experience. Such an opportunity was hard to come by—like finding a lantern in broad daylight.  

"Good, let’s go." Old Lin was very pleased with Zhang Yan’s attitude.  

"Our Spirit Herb Garden is just one of tens of thousands under the Qingheng Sect. The sect owns countless spirit fields—you could say that within Qingheng Mountain, our Qingheng Sect is the heavens!"  

"Being able to join the Qingheng Sect is a blessing earned from your past life. Though your aptitude is lacking, don’t be discouraged. Save up some spirit stones, marry a wife, and have children. Who knows? Maybe your descendants will have better talent."  

"To be honest with you, this old man once had a daughter—a mid-grade spiritual root. She’s now an inner disciple of the Qingheng Sect, with hopes of reaching Foundation Establishment in the future!"  

At this point, Old Lin’s eyes brightened, and his tone became noticeably livelier.  

"An inner disciple!"  

Zhang Yan’s face showed genuine envy—he wasn’t faking it.  

Disciples of the Qingheng Sect were divided into outer disciples, inner disciples, and true disciples.  

If the sect were compared to a company, then the elders and deacons would be the managers, reaping the greatest benefits. True disciples would be the management trainees, receiving the sect’s full investment and training.  

Inner disciples would be the middle management—while the upper echelons feasted, they at least got to drink the broth.  

Outer disciples, however, were the lowest-level laborers.  

They did the hardest, most exhausting work for the least reward—sometimes none at all. After all, even companies paid wages, but as outer disciples, the sect not only withheld payment but actively exploited them.  

For example, after a year of backbreaking labor in the Spirit Herb Garden, seventy percent of their earnings went to the sect. Only the remaining thirty percent was theirs to keep.  

From this, it was clear that the Qingheng Sect’s true focus was on its true disciples. Inner disciples were left to fend for themselves—if they succeeded, great; if not, no big loss.  

Outer disciples like Zhang Yan? They were nothing more than objects of exploitation.  

The sad part was, even this pitiful status was something many couldn’t attain.  

Zhang Yan sighed inwardly.  

But since he couldn’t change the rules, he would simply have to adapt.  

First, he’d set a small goal: once he reached the Qi Refining stage, he’d lease two hundred acres of spirit fields and earn a fortune!  

The spirit fields Old Lin managed weren’t far from their garden.  

After passing through lush forests and treading along overgrown paths, they finally arrived at the edge of a vast expanse of spirit fields.  

It was midsummer.  

Under the scorching sun, a gentle breeze stirred the green spirit rice, sending waves rippling endlessly across the fields—a soothing sight.  

"All these spirit fields are under my lease."  

"Learn well from me, and at the very least, you’ll have a stable foundation."  

Seeing Zhang Yan’s awed expression, Old Lin couldn’t help but smirk with pride.  

Though his cultivation was mediocre, he had a genuine talent for cultivation techniques—otherwise, with his aptitude, he never would’ve been able to marry and have children within the Qingheng Sect.  

"Your task today is weeding. These spirit fields are rich in spiritual energy, but weeds grow alongside the spirit rice, competing for that energy. Your job is to remove them." As he spoke, Old Lin demonstrated, pointing out the differences between weeds and spirit rice.  

The weeds looked deceptively similar to the spirit rice. Without careful observation, it was easy to mistake one for the other.  

Old Lin casually plucked two weeds from the field.  

"These weeds absorb spiritual energy. After uprooting them, be sure to toss them onto the roadside—never leave them in the field. Otherwise, they’ll regrow overnight."  

"Yes, Elder Lin!"  

Zhang Yan nodded and reached out to pull the weeds.  

"Hmm?"  

Though the weeds weren’t tall, no matter how hard Zhang Yan tugged, they wouldn’t budge.  

"These weeds have roots that stretch dozens of meters deep. You won’t pull them out like this—use this hoe to cut them." Seeing this, Old Lin patted the storage pouch at his waist.  

A hoe appeared in his hand, which he then handed to Zhang Yan.  

"Thank you, Elder Lin." Zhang Yan marveled at the wonders of the cultivation world. Even a simple weed could stump him.  

"Good, work hard. I’ll go water the fields." After handing over the hoe, Old Lin turned and left.  

Zhang Yan remained silent, staring intently at the hoe in his hand.  

Just yesterday, he’d been wondering when he’d encounter his next piece of equipment.  

Yet here it was—only a day later—his second piece of equipment.  

**[Name]:** Spirit Hoe  
**[Quality]:** Gray  
**[Equipment Effects]:** Sharpness, Minor Mastery of Spirit Plant Cultivation, Spirit Plant Identification  

"This…"  

"It’s actually another piece of equipment!"  

Zhang Yan’s eyes widened. Moreover, this equipment had three effects.  

**Sharpness:** Your weapons and attacks gain a layer of sharpness.  
**Minor Mastery of Spirit Plant Cultivation:** You are now a barely qualified spirit planter!  
**Spirit Plant Identification:** You can now recognize common spirit plants.
