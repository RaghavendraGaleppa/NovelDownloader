# Chapter 47: The Convicted Women

"Do you still remember the warnings our sect master gave you?" Gao Changdong turned around, sternly reprimanding the three girls. "Here, you must be proper, diligent, and most importantly, 'obedient'! Do you understand?"

After scolding them, he looked at the girls, who were once spoiled and waited on hand and foot. However, after the fright they experienced at the Judicial Bureau, they now cowered like scared quails, nodding repeatedly.

Gao Changdong then turned to Li Zhiming, his face filled with a smile, and even nodded slightly. "Dr. Li, I've kept that person here. If there's anything you're not satisfied with, just send someone to let us know."

"Thank you, Chief Gao. Take care, and Han Li, go fetch a few bottles of 'Serenity Pills' for Chief Gao," Li Zhiming said.

Han Li immediately went to fetch the pills. Gao Changdong's face was now filled with a smile, and he couldn't refuse Li Zhiming's gesture. It was an opportunity to curry favor with the doctor.

As Gao Changdong left, Li Zhiming stood up to see him off. However, he only took a few steps before Gao Changdong stopped him, insisting that he return.

Li Zhiming couldn't help but think that Gao Changdong was being overly cautious. With his current physical condition, a little rain wouldn't harm him. However, if Li Zhiming caught a cold, the consequences would be severe.

After Gao Changdong left, the three girls were left alone in the room, filled with a sense of oppression, unfamiliarity, and fear. However, Li Zhiming didn't notice any of this.

Li Zhiming was still unaware of the intentions behind the selection of these girls, including the connections between Meng Wei and Gao Changdong.

As Li Zhiming walked away, he thought to himself that his life had taken a dramatic turn. He was now in a position to give orders, just like the corrupt wealthy merchants.

Although he thought this, his expression remained unchanged. "Han Li, take them down. I'm feeling a bit irritable and need some time alone," he said, then turned and walked away.

Just as he was about to leave, Li Zhiming caught a glimpse of a green glow on one of the girls' heads. However, he said nothing and continued on his way.

With Li Zhiming gone, the girls let out a collective sigh of relief. Han Li appeared before them, her expression gloomy. "Follow me," she said, leading them away.

"This is where you'll be staying," Han Li said, opening a door.

After Han Li left, Jiang Yun let out a deep breath, and the other girls began to tremble, eventually calming down as they huddled together, whispering and crying.

Jiang Yun got up to close the door, ensuring that their crying wouldn't be overheard.

As they cried, Jiang Yun began to recount her story. "My father was the governor of Wang Province. He was implicated in the silver reserve embezzlement case and executed."

The other two girls listened, their eyes filled with tears. They introduced themselves, revealing that they were also daughters of officials who had been implicated in the same case.

The youngest girl, Zhong Jun, was the most timid, revealing that her father was a low-ranking official in Wang Province.

As they shared their stories, the girls realized that they had been brought together by circumstance, and despite their different backgrounds, they were now in the same situation.
