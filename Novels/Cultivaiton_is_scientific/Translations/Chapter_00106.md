# Chapter 106: South Mountain

Li Shiming sat atop his paper crane, retrieving his identity jade slip. He first sent a message to Yin Shilan, informing her that he was leaving to complete a mandatory mission. 

He then checked the mission details—it involved traveling to the South Mountain Kingdom to treat a spiritual tree. Given that South Mountain was a mundane realm, the spiritual tree there likely wasn't anything particularly valuable. Precious spiritual plants couldn't survive in areas with such sparse spiritual energy. However, considering his documented status as a novice spiritual farmer, the assignment made sense.

The only issue was the distance. Traveling by paper crane would take over ten days just to reach the destination. 

*This might actually be a good thing*, he mused. *The farther I am from the sect, the harder it'll be for the Holy Ice Sect to investigate me. After all, this is a mandatory mission assigned by the Enforcement Hall—not something I requested!* 

After flying for two hours, he couldn't help but feel the pace was excruciatingly slow. While the speed was comparable to a car from his past life, for a cultivator covering vast distances, the paper crane's speed was painfully inadequate. 

Back when he was at the early Qi Refining stage, his limited spiritual energy had left him no choice. But now, at the fourth layer of Qi Refining—solidly in the mid-stage—he had some real power at his disposal. 

He hadn't learned any flight techniques, but the *Sword Control Art* he practiced included a method for riding a sword through the air. Previously, his spiritual energy had been insufficient to sustain such flight. 

Without hesitation, he stowed the paper crane, leaving himself momentarily suspended in midair. Just as he began to plummet toward the ocean, he flicked his fingers, summoning the Green Kite Wooden Sword. It transformed into a streak of golden-green sword light. 

At the fourth layer of Qi Refining, wielding a high-grade magical artifact like this wasn't sustainable for long, but he had no other options. He couldn't use the Blazing Flame Sword—it had been confiscated by Baili Jinyan at one point, and there was no telling if it carried any lingering traces. 

The Green Kite Wooden Sword was the only sword-type artifact he had fully refined. Without it, he'd have nothing to use for the *Sword Control Art*. 

"Behold the sword cultivator's flight!" he declared theatrically, feeling slightly ridiculous. But with no other cultivators within ten miles, he allowed himself this moment of indulgence. 

The sword light caught his falling body, then expanded to envelop him entirely. With a sudden burst of speed, he heard the air tearing around him. His spiritual energy drained rapidly—10% every ten breaths. 

After thirty breaths, he had to stop. The consumption was simply too great. But in that brief flight, he'd glimpsed the terrifying potential of sword cultivators. 

This was true self-powered flight, at least five times faster than the paper crane. And this was only at the fourth layer of Qi Refining—higher levels would bring even greater speed. 

He took out two spirit stones, absorbing their energy to replenish his reserves. This was standard practice for Qi Refining cultivators. There were three ways to recover spiritual energy: 

1. Natural recovery—slow and steady absorption through the spiritual vortex.  
2. Medicinal pills—the fastest method, but prohibitively expensive for most Qi Refining cultivators.  
3. Spirit stones—the most common method, balancing cost and efficiency.  

Li Shiming opted for spirit stones. Once replenished, he resumed practicing his sword flight. With each attempt, his mastery of the *Sword Control Art* improved. Drawing on aerodynamic principles from his IBMz15's database, he refined the sword light's shape to reduce air resistance. 

His flight distance increased from eight *li* in thirty breaths to ten *li*. At peak speed, he estimated he could reach 600 kilometers per hour. 

Still, the spiritual energy cost prevented him from using sword flight as his primary mode of transportation. He alternated between flying and recovering, making steady progress.

Yin Shilan emerged from her research, shaking off fatigue as she noticed the message on her identity jade slip. No matter how busy she was, she always reserved midday for communication with Li Shiming. 

Their exchanges not only advanced her array mastery but also brought her an inexplicable sense of closeness. 

"A mandatory mission?" she murmured, disappointed. As a privileged disciple, she'd never been subjected to such assignments—the sect always negotiated requests with her. 

"I'll ask him about it when he returns," she decided, immediately diving back into her studies. Unlike Li Shiming with his IBMz15, her achievements as a mid-level array master at such a young age came solely from relentless dedication and passion.

Meanwhile, Han Tianlei eagerly exploited his Enforcement Hall authority to forcibly activate Eagle Beak Island's defensive formation. To him, Li Shiming was already a dead man—the island's high-grade spirit fields and enchanted bamboo now belonged to him. 

Bypassing standard procedures with backing from Enforcement Hall's Xu Peiran, Han Tianlei transferred the island's ownership to himself. All it cost was an annual tribute of a few hundred *jin* of spirit rice. 

The Han Family—a rogue cultivator clan based in South Mountain Kingdom—had flourished under Han Tianlei's status as a Tianhai Sect enforcer. Were it not for the emperor's sect protection, the Hans might have seized the throne. 

Gathered in their ancestral hall, ten Han cultivators listened as patriarch Han Yu relayed Han Tianlei's orders: eliminate a fourth-layer Qi Refining sect disciple without leaving traces. 

"Just fourth layer? What's his background?" one clansman asked dismissively. 

"Don't underestimate him," another cautioned. "Sect disciples always have tricks." 

Han Yu added, "He's a new recruit who became a spiritual farmer. Probably not too strong, but stay alert." 

The mood lightened. While sect disciples warranted caution, a newcomer with less than a year's training couldn't pose much threat. Cultivation required time—progress came in years, not months. 

"Move out in full force to Long Stone Valley," Han Yu commanded. The valley was the only practical land route into South Mountain Kingdom—exactly where the mission instructions would lead Li Shiming.

After ten days of alternating between sword flight and recovery, Li Shiming finally reached land. The solid ground beneath his feet brought relief—despite his cultivation, the ocean still commanded his respect. 

His journey had been uneventful, traveling through sect-controlled territory where few would dare attack a Tianhai disciple. 

Now in South Mountain Kingdom but still distant from his destination, he paused to rest. With two days' travel remaining, curiosity finally overcame caution. 

Far from the sect and the Holy Ice Sect's reach, he felt safe investigating Baili Jinyan's storage bracelet. At worst, he'd examine its contents within his machine room space using his avatar. 

After setting up the Black Shade Concealment Array—the best defensive formation he currently had—he switched consciousness to his avatar. 

The avatar picked up the storage bracelet, channeling spiritual energy inside. Immediately, his attention locked onto the flying vessel. 

Ever since seeing Yin Shilan standing elegantly on her own vessel, he'd longed for one to share with her. 

This model appeared small—just a foot long within the spacious bracelet—but he knew it could expand to full size once认主 (recognized as master).
