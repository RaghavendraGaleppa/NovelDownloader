# Chapter 151: Goal Determined - The Great Dream Heart Realm Immortal Scripture

"True Yang Supreme Venerable—"

So his master had such a title?

A trace of surprise flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. Senior Brother Feng Wuyu hadn't mentioned this before.

Opposite him, noticing the subtle change in Zhang Jing's expression, Yan Chihong thought for a moment and understood the reason. He smiled and explained:

"Haha, Junior Brother, having just ascended from the lower nine realms, you might not yet be aware of your master's formidable reputation throughout the Profound Yellow World and even beyond—or perhaps I should say, his fearsome reputation!"

He added silently in his heart.

Just thinking about the numerous foreign deities who had fallen to the True Yang Supreme Venerable, along with the many Heavenly Immortal powerhouses from the Myriad Races faction within the Profound Yellow World, made Yan Chihong's scalp tingle.

Looking at Zhang Jing with undisguised envy, he said:

"Junior Brother, among the many Heavenly Immortal True Lords of your Supreme Unity Dao Sect, the True Yang Supreme Venerable undoubtedly stands at the very pinnacle. It's said throughout the Profound Yellow World that the Supreme Venerable might attain the Golden Immortal Dao Fruit within the next million years. To be accepted as his disciple—you must have accumulated ten lifetimes of good fortune."

As he spoke, Yan Chihong's envy seemed about to overflow from his eyes.

"You flatter me, Senior Brother. I'm merely a nominal disciple," Zhang Jing replied modestly.

"It's different—you were personally guided from the lower realms by him. By the way, Senior Brother Yan, you don't seem to be from our Supreme Unity Dao Sect?" Zhang Jing suddenly realized something and asked curiously.

"I'm from the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect of the True Ascent Treasure Ultimate Heaven, currently stationed at the Multiverse Auction House in your Radiant Immortal Realm," Yan Chihong answered without hesitation.

"True Ascent Treasure Ultimate Heaven, Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect!"

Zhang Jing was momentarily stunned.

Of course he knew of the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect—another top-tier human inheritance power in the Profound Yellow World, a colossal entity comparable to the Supreme Unity Infinite Dao Sect, ruling over one of humanity's seven great heavenly realms, the True Ascent Treasure Ultimate Heaven.

However, unlike the Supreme Unity Infinite Dao Sect, the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect was rather... unique.

They were most famous for their Wandering Immortals.

These Wandering Immortals traveled throughout the myriad worlds. Beyond humanity's seven heavenly realms, their presence could be found in the eleven heavenly realms of the Myriad Races faction and even the most mysterious Primordial Profound Yellow Heaven.

They claimed to buy and sell anything and everything.

Zhang Jing had even heard that the Wandering Immortals' business had expanded beyond the Profound Yellow World, with many foreign deities being both their customers... and sometimes merchandise.

"So the Multiverse Auction House was established by the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect."

Zhang Jing marveled inwardly, yet somehow it made perfect sense.

After some casual conversation, remembering he still had important business in the Radiant Immortal Realm, Zhang Jing prepared to take his leave from Yan Chihong.

Unexpectedly—

"Junior Brother, please accept this Golden Token of our Multiverse Auction House's honored guests."

Yan Chihong stopped Zhang Jing, handing him a palm-sized golden plaque shimmering with crimson-gold light, its surface engraved with intricate Dao patterns.

"Senior Brother, this is...?" Zhang Jing looked curiously at the token.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, this is specially prepared for our honored guests. With this token, you won't need to physically visit the auction house for future transactions, and you'll be exempt from luck deductions," Yan Chihong explained enthusiastically.

Hearing this, Zhang Jing's eyes lit up.

"Then this junior won't decline your kindness."

He accepted the token with a smile.

Zhang Jing understood perfectly well that this gesture was almost certainly due to his master's influence.

But so what?

He, Zhang Jing, had earned this master through his own abilities!

Before long.

In the Dao Repository Secret Realm.

Zhang Jing's figure suddenly appeared.

Without delay, the Chaos Dao Mark between his brows manifested as he directly connected with the vast consciousness of the Dao Repository.

In the next instant.

The countless stars above began to shimmer.

Rather than immediately exchanging for Dao Intent, Zhang Jing began carefully searching through the numerous immortal Dao inheritances within the repository.

He wanted to see if any matched his envisioned cultivation method.

After careful consideration before coming here, Zhang Jing had ultimately set his sights on immortal inheritances related to void and miniature worlds.

He believed that such inheritances, when upgraded into Dao Seeds, would perfectly integrate various Dao Intents—crucially aligning with the Primordial Beginning World lineage's path of world derivation.

An unknown amount of time passed.

A trace of exhaustion unconsciously surfaced in Zhang Jing's eyes.

Sifting through the ocean of inheritances to find those meeting his requirements was no easy task.

Fortunately—

Zhang Jing looked at the two stars before him, a satisfied smile appearing at the corners of his eyes.

Yet this smile soon turned to helplessness.

Before him, two stars shone with brilliant radiance:

[Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability - 990,000,000 Luck Points]
Description: With the Twenty-Four Heavens empowering oneself, Dharma power becomes boundless, divine abilities immeasurable.
Cultivation Requirements: Golden Core Realm! Foundation Establishment practitioners may attempt preliminary cultivation, requiring mastery of: Perfect Devouring Cosmic Python Dao Intent, Perfect Blazing Annihilation Vermilion Bird Dao Intent, Perfect True Water Mystic Whale Dao Intent, Perfect Thousand Mountains Bixi Dao Intent, Perfect Gentle Wind Wenlin Dao Intent!

[Great Dream Heart Realm Immortal Scripture - 80,000,000 Luck Points]
Description: Evolve a dream realm heart domain—a glance spanning ten thousand years, where I am the dream and the dream is me; illusion becomes reality and reality illusion!

One divine ability, one cultivation method.

These were the results of Zhang Jing's meticulous selection from countless immortal inheritances.

His gaze lingered on the two stars as his brows furrowed slightly.

The cultivation requirements for the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability weren't problematic for him.

The five Dao Intents required for preliminary Foundation Establishment cultivation were conveniently included among the thirty-six Dao Intents needed to advance to Golden Core Realm through the Primordial Beginning World's path of world derivation.

The only issue was the price!

The staggering 990 million luck points made it nearly impossible to consider purchasing.

At least at his current Foundation Establishment stage, Zhang Jing couldn't conceive of any way to accumulate nearly a billion luck points.

With this thought, the star containing the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability quietly receded, leaving only the one containing the Great Dream Heart Realm Immortal Scripture.

This inheritance might be the most suitable choice available now.

Creating a Great Dream Heart Realm to achieve True Immortality through merging with the Dao via the heart realm...

Having upgraded so many skills into Dao Seeds through the jade talisman in his Niwan Palace, Zhang Jing had gained some insight.

He could confirm that the direction in which the jade talisman upgraded skills into Dao Seeds was actually influenced by his subconscious.

Meaning—

If Zhang Jing cultivated the Great Dream Heart Realm Immortal Scripture, then under his deliberate influence, there was a high probability this skill would evolve into a Heart Realm Dao Seed far surpassing the original version's capabilities.

And as a mental dream domain, the Heart Realm Dao Seed would have both the potential and capacity to integrate thirty-six Dao Intents, transforming into a 'Great Dream Heart Realm Immortal Seed' containing thirty-six Dao principles.

What would happen if he fused this Immortal Seed into his Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation?

Zhang Jing didn't need to think twice.

Even at worst, it would undoubtedly be far superior to simply fusing thirty-six Dao Intents into the Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation.

And the key point—a dream mental world was still a world!

This ensured the World Derivation path wouldn't deviate significantly.

As for the steep price of 80 million...

Zhang Jing didn't consider it a major issue.

After all, his master had given him a full three hundred years to advance to Golden Core Divine Ability Realm.

At one million luck points per year, accumulating eighty million would take only eighty years.

Factoring in the time needed to comprehend thirty-six Dao Intents—no more than thirty additional years.

This left him nearly two hundred years to upgrade the Great Dream Heart Realm Immortal Scripture into a Dao Seed.

The plan was entirely feasible!

At this realization, Zhang Jing couldn't help but exhale in relief, his expression visibly relaxing.

Only with the assistance of his mysterious jade talisman would such an approach be possible.

For other cultivators, merely comprehending thirty-six Dao Intents would be headache-inducing enough.

Then, with a thought:

[Zhang Jing (Nominal Disciple of the Crimson Brilliance Grand Vast Cave Heaven): 3,349,900 Luck Points]

"Enough to purchase three or four Dao Intents," Zhang Jing mused silently.
