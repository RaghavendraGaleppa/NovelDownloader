# Chapter 41: Overbearing

"Uncle-Master Chen, could we possibly turn back for a moment?" Han Zhen asked, his cold gaze fixed on Daoist Qingwen's figure.

"What is it?" Uncle-Master Chen showed no displeasure, instead looking curiously in the direction Han Zhen was staring.

"Two of my friends have gone missing. It might be related to that person down there." Han Zhen quickly explained the disappearances of rogue cultivators during the Tai'nan Small Gathering. Although he had a suspect, he couldn't do anything without evidence.

"I hope Uncle-Master Chen can help this junior uncover the truth," Han Zhen said, cupping his fists with an air of righteousness.

"Such a thing!" Uncle-Master Chen snorted coldly. Immediately, he commanded the Golden Beak White-Headed Vulture to turn back, descending onto the essential path leading out of Tai'nan Valley. The cultivators below, seeing the massive dark shadow bringing a gust of wind, quickly dodged to the side.

Daoist Qingwen and his companions were directly in its path, their way blocked. With nowhere to hide, several talismans glowed in their hands, allowing them to stabilize their footing. Besides Qingwen, the few people behind him found their limbs slightly unresponsive the moment the Tier 1 high-grade demonic beast's golden eyes fixed on them. Cold sweat trickled down Qingwen's forehead. He steeled himself and looked up, only then noticing a young man staring coldly at him from beside the terrifying old man on the bird's back.

"This humble one's Daoist name is Qingwen. May I ask this senior from Spirit Beast Mountain why you have stopped me?" Daoist Qingwen asked, making a respectful bow, his voice trembling slightly.

Han Zhen looked at Uncle-Master Chen. After the latter nodded, Han Zhen spoke in a cold voice, "Evidence indicates that the disappearances of rogue cultivators at the Tai'nan Small Gathering over these past years are the work of Daoist Qingwen. What more do you have to say in your defense, Daoist?"

Uncle-Master Chen looked at Han Zhen with satisfaction and nodded. He had shed the mortal world's rules so quickly. This boy had also so quickly understood the law of the jungle in the cultivation world, already knowing how to bully others with power. It seemed there was no need to worry about him not adapting once he arrived at Spirit Beast Mountain.

Upon hearing Han Zhen's words, Daoist Qingwen was first startled, then said with an innocent expression, "Daoist Han, are you perhaps joking with this poor Daoist? If Daoist Han claims to have evidence, then present it for everyone to judge! Otherwise, in front of so many fellow cultivators, this poor Daoist would rather die than accept such slander!"

Qingwen truly lived up to his reputation as someone capable of uniting rogue cultivators of diverse personalities. In just a few words, he made them share his indignation.

"That's right, if Daoist Han has a grudge against Daoist Qingwen, he shouldn't use such methods to humiliate someone!" said a pair of rogue cultivator husband and wife behind Qingwen.

"Amitabha, it's better to resolve enmities than to deepen them. This humble monk hopes Daoist Han can spare Daoist Qingwen." A young monk stepped forward, attempting to stop the conflict, considering it a meritorious deed.

The surrounding rogue cultivators also chimed in, saying a few words. This was exactly the effect Qingwen desired. By leveraging this "lamenting for the fox's death when the rabbit is gone" atmosphere, Qingwen hoped this senior from Spirit Beast Mountain would be hesitant. Surely, in front of so many fellow cultivators, one wouldn't just casually kill someone over a disagreement?

Han Zhen was about to speak, but unexpectedly, Elder Chen's cold snort seemed to explode in the ears of the rogue cultivators: "Hmph, this old man's suspicion *is* the evidence!"

These Qi Condensation realm cultivators were momentarily dazed. A Foundation Establishment Immortal Master was truly this overbearing. When they recovered, they saw a green whip lashing out towards Daoist Qingwen, with no intention of further explanation. Naturally, there were plenty of methods to make Daoist Qingwen confess that the disappearances of rogue cultivators were indeed his doing.

At this moment, no one dared to stand by Qingwen's side anymore, all frantically dodging away. Qingwen knew he couldn't get away cleanly. If caught, some items in his storage bag would definitely lead to further discoveries. Daoist Qingwen raised his head, a sinister expression on his face, looking at Han Zhen. Suddenly, he flicked his sleeve, and several talismans flew out. Two of them seemed to be sound transmission talismans, flying towards outside the valley.

Uncle-Master Chen did not intercept them. Instead, he patted the spirit beast pouch at his waist. Before Han Zhen could even see clearly, something had already shot out in pursuit. Daoist Qingwen didn't notice this. He slapped another talisman onto himself, and a blue light instantly flared beneath his feet. Han Zhen watched Qingwen's desperate struggles before a Foundation Establishment cultivator. He knew there was no chance of escape; perhaps surrendering and revealing the Black Fiend Sect would have given him a chance to live.

Sure enough, Daoist Qingwen had only streaked a few *zhang* away when a streak of blood flashed past, and Daoist Qingwen's headless corpse fell to the ground. Unbeknownst to anyone, a jade toad, about a *zhang* tall, had appeared on Daoist Qingwen's inevitable escape path. The pressure emanating from its body was no less than that of the old man on the giant bird's back. It was clearly a Tier 2 demonic beast. The jade toad extended its tongue again and, with a flick, Daoist Qingwen's headless corpse vanished into its belly. The jade toad's belly wriggled, then it spat out some items. Besides miscellaneous objects, there was also a grey storage bag. Then the jade toad's eyes swiveled around, looking at the surrounding rogue cultivators. Fortunately, the Foundation Establishment old man recalled the demonic beast, and only then did the rogue cultivators feel like they had retrieved their lives.

Uncle-Master Chen's intention was clear: he deliberately had the jade toad spit out these items because he disdained the possessions of a Qi Condensation cultivator, and thus gave them as a favor to Han Zhen. Han Zhen couldn't help but gain a more intuitive understanding of what another Uncle-Master had said: high-level cultivators view low-level cultivators as ants, and will act decisively and kill without a second thought.

Han Zhen once again reminded himself that this was the kind of world he would face in the future, and he must act cautiously and with foresight. Although the process had some unexpected turns, Daoist Qingwen's death was still the outcome Han Zhen desired. As for the gazes of the rogue cultivators, Han Zhen paid them no mind.

Using his magic power, Han Zhen pulled Qingwen's storage bag into his hand. His divine sense probed inside, and then he let out a cold laugh. Just like that, in front of numerous rogue cultivators, the contents of Daoist Qingwen's storage bag spilled out everywhere. Besides various miscellaneous magical artifacts, there were also many female items. Some sharp-eyed rogue cultivators instantly recognized many familiar items among them—magical artifacts that were inconvenient to fence in Tai'nan Valley.

"Isn't that... the magical artifact of the Luo couple who disappeared a year ago? I remember that gourd very clearly!!"

"How could it be Immortal Fairy Ruyan? I saw her wear that immortal dress once, I can't believe she also met with such a terrible fate! Despicable!!" This was clearly the cry of a heartbroken rogue cultivator.

"Amitabha, I can't believe Qingwen was such a person!" The young monk bowed towards the scattered relics on the ground, seemingly chanting sutras for their salvation.

The several rogue cultivators who had been associated with Daoist Qingwen felt more a sense of relief at surviving a calamity, and they all bowed to Han Zhen in thanks. Han Zhen took the spirit stones and a few seemingly valuable items from Qingwen's remains. Then, with a wave of his hand, he tossed the lower-grade magical artifacts to some of the rogue cultivators.

The great bird soared into the sky, flying south towards the State of Yue.
