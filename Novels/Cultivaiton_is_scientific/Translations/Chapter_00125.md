# Chapter 125: Resolution

It wasn't the fault of the 'Demonic Sound Lotus'—Li Shiming had simply chosen the wrong targets to use his soundwave technique on.

Had he used the 'Demonic Sound Lotus' against cultivators from other sects, even demonic ones, the effect would have been significant. However, due to the nature of their core cultivation techniques, the Sacred Ice Sect disciples possessed an extraordinary resistance to mind-altering illusions.

Moreover, Li Shiming's cultivation level was still too low. Had he reached the late-stage Qi Refinement realm, the two late-stage cultivators wouldn't have stood a chance.

As he pondered this, a flash of cold light appeared before his eyes. 

A translucent ice sword stopped half a meter from his face. In front of him, a small Spirit Turtle Shield materialized. A mid-grade Spirit Turtle Shield naturally couldn't fully block a full-force strike from a seventh-level Qi Refinement cultivator—it was the shield's defensive array that had activated.

Still, the impact caused the shield's defensive array to tremble before completely neutralizing the attack.

Li Shiming narrowed his eyes and unleashed a Spiritual Thought Jade Sword—an attack undetectable to the two late-stage cultivators—directed at the seventh-level cultivator. Simultaneously, the Green Kite Wooden Sword, guided by his 'Sword Control Art', transformed into a streak of sword light that followed the Spiritual Thought Jade Sword toward the same target.

Speaking of the Green Kite Wooden Sword, after acquiring more spirit stones, Li Shiming had considered purchasing a metal-attribute high-grade sword from the Yun Trading Company. However, none of the options he examined satisfied him. 

The main issue was that the Green Kite Wooden Sword's quality was simply too high. Switching to other high-grade metal swords wouldn't provide a substantial improvement in the 'Sword Control Art's' effectiveness. Factoring in the time needed to refine a new high-grade sword, he deemed the exchange unworthy. Thus, he continued using the Green Kite Wooden Sword.

Another crucial reason was his heightened standards. Having seen the artifacts in Baili Jinyan's storage bracelet—though he couldn't yet use them—he found ordinary high-grade artifacts unimpressive.

The seventh-level cultivator was shocked when his attack failed to breach Li Shiming's defenses. This was a direct confrontation, yet his high-grade artifact couldn't penetrate the defenses of a mere fourth-level Qi Refinement cultivator. Even if the opponent was using a high-grade defensive artifact, this shouldn't have happened.

The fact that Li Shiming's Spirit Turtle Shield was only mid-grade made the situation even more perplexing. 

In the cultivation world, artifacts were undoubtedly important, but cultivation level mattered more. Each level brought qualitative changes to spiritual energy, enhancing both power and artifact control.

Theoretically, a seventh-level Qi Refinement cultivator wielding a high-grade artifact should easily break through a fourth-level cultivator's high-grade defenses.

As the seventh-level cultivator contemplated another attack, an excruciating pain erupted in his head—not physical, but spiritual. 

Having delegated defense to the eighth-level cultivator, he was completely unprotected. Even if he had defenses, the Spiritual Thought Jade Sword's attack was beyond what Qi Refinement cultivators could resist—an overpowered method of assault.

Had Li Shiming practiced the 'Jade Heart Ice Thought Technique' longer, this single strike could have killed the seventh-level cultivator instantly. 

Spiritual Thought was a hallmark of Foundation Establishment cultivators, representing an attack method a full major realm above Qi Refinement. Even ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators lacked such spiritual attack techniques.

The seventh-level cultivator opened his mouth to scream, but a sword light pierced his chest, silencing him forever.

The eighth-level cultivator never imagined his comrade would be instantly killed in a clash with a mere fourth-level cultivator. He was barely holding his own against the copper corpse's mid-grade Gatling artifact, relying on pills to boost his strength.

He desperately wanted to flee, but Li Shiming's position blocked the cave entrance perfectly. To escape, he'd have to break through both the copper corpse and Li Shiming.

"Let's die together!" the eighth-level cultivator roared, his eyes filled with madness.

His spiritual energy fluctuated violently as his body began to swell.

Li Shiming had no intention of letting him self-destruct. A late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator's explosion would obliterate him. 

He launched another Spiritual Thought Jade Sword. The moment it struck the eighth-level cultivator's brain, the madness in his eyes froze. 

Without spiritual energy to sustain it, the high-grade shield was knocked away by a barrage of ice bullets. The eighth-level cultivator's body was exposed, and within moments, his chest was riddled with holes—the fatal one piercing his heart.

Li Shiming exhaled deeply. He had won, but the battle hadn't been as easy as he'd anticipated.

Using the Spiritual Thought Jade Sword twice against higher-level opponents left him mentally exhausted. He now understood the risks of this technique—he'd been fortunate his opponents lacked defenses against spiritual attacks.

Had they possessed countermeasures, the level difference could have inflicted severe spiritual damage.

Before the fight, he'd underestimated the two late-stage cultivators' combat prowess. Only during the battle did he realize his mistake. Without the Gatling's suppression, he wouldn't have had the chance to use his spiritual attacks. This deepened his understanding of how level disparities affected combat.

Li Shiming approached the corpses and performed the 'Soul Control Division Technique', absorbing their souls. He then stored the bodies and cleaned up the battle traces in the cave.

The cave, protected by arrays, remained intact. His main task was retrieving all the ice bullets, which would eventually melt as their spiritual energy dissipated.

Inspecting the cave further, he found a storage room stocked with fasting pills and healing medicines. Two other rooms were equipped with spirit-gathering arrays—expensive setups indicating this was an important outpost.

From their combat style, he recognized the two as Sacred Ice Sect disciples, undoubtedly connected to the aftermath of Baili Jinyan's death.

Li Shiming left the pills untouched and didn't dismantle the arrays. Before designing the 'Thousand-Mile Mutual Vision', he would've looted everything—the array materials were valuable. 

But now, with greater resources, he had deeper plans.

He began setting up the cave, primarily burying solid explosives—a mix of nitroglycerin and other chemicals—beneath it. With unrestricted access to materials, he'd recreated one of his previous world's most powerful explosives.

Two tons of solid explosives were hidden underground. 

He also installed pinhole cameras on the main hall's walls. Since the cave's thick stone blocked signals, he modified the existing arrays to transmit information outward—a simplified version of the sect's communication array, effective within eighty meters.

Outside the cave, underwater, he placed a relay receiver connected by a kilometer-long cable.

With everything prepared, Li Shiming waited in a small underwater cave a kilometer away, wearing a diving suit.

He planned to stay for several days, fishing for the departed Foundation Establishment cultivator. While he couldn't defeat such an opponent directly, he doubted even a Foundation Establishment cultivator could survive two tons of enhanced explosives in a confined space.

If the explosives failed, he'd retreat to Eagle Beak Island immediately—or even seek refuge in the Nine Peaks if necessary. Given his status in Dui Peak, securing a cave there was plausible.

Underwater, an oxygen generator in his spatial pocket supplied air through a tube, allowing him to stay indefinitely. Though cultivation methods could achieve similar results, he preferred technology to avoid spiritual energy fluctuations.

With time to spare, he practiced the 'Soul Control Division Technique'. The two late-stage souls provided excellent material.

'Soul Control' involved manipulating synthesized souls created from harvested ones—whether from cultivators or spirit beasts. Ordinary souls were too weak.

Li Shiming merged the two souls into a 'Primary Spirit', a dense energy mass visible to his spiritual sense. Only late-stage Qi Refinement souls met the technique's minimum requirements; weaker souls would require continuous feeding.

The technique's greatest advantage was reconnaissance. By splitting a tiny fraction of the Primary Spirit into a 'Divided Spirit', it could scout vast distances indefinitely unless destroyed or depleted.

The Divided Spirit shared senses with the Primary Spirit, which in turn shared them with its master. Thus, no matter how far the Divided Spirit traveled, the master could perceive everything it did.

Though extremely fragile, Divided Spirits were nearly undetectable and often ignored even if noticed—making the 'Soul Control Division Technique' incredibly valuable. 

Li Shiming carefully created a Divided Spirit, so faint he could barely sense it even nearby. In water, its presence was even subtler.

"Looks like Divided Spirits can replace some surveillance tasks," he mused.

The Divided Spirit moved effortlessly through water, encountering oblivious fish. Surfacing, it provided a second vantage point alongside the cave's cameras.

He estimated the Divided Spirit would last about ten days. Without replenishing souls, the Primary Spirit couldn't create more.

He imagined Baili Jinyan must have possessed a powerful Primary Spirit, lost in the explosion.

During his absence, neither Yin Shilan nor Ren Feier could reach him via identity jade slips. Yin Shilan visited Eagle Beak Island, finding its defensive arrays active, and assumed he was in seclusion. Ren Feier, having traveled with him before, remained unconcerned, tallying the stories he owed her for later collection.
