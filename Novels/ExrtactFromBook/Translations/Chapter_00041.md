# Chapter 41: Four Items  

A piercing shout suddenly erupted from one of the bamboo-walled private booths, drowning out Xu Yuan's voice.  

The voice was like a steel saw scraping against sheet metal—sharp as a nail driven into the ear, stirring an indescribable discomfort in the heart.  

"Xu! Who has the patience to listen to all your nonsense?"  

"Why are we even here? Get to the point already!"  

Xu Yuan's speech was abruptly cut off, and the hall fell silent.  

Then, from the same booth, another voice emerged.  

"Apologies, Master Xu!"  

"My brother here rarely ventures out and isn't familiar with human customs. Please pretend he doesn't exist!"  

"Master Xu, your words are most enlightening—do continue, haha!"  

This time, it was a young girl's voice, light and crisp like birdsong at dawn, lifting the mood instantly.  

"What's wrong with what I said? Let's get this over with and leave. Who wants to stay here any longer?"  

After a brief back-and-forth between the two, the lecture became impossible to continue.  

Xu Yuan chuckled and, without further hesitation, announced:  

"My apologies for the oversight. Since a fellow cultivator has raised the point, we shall adjust the schedule for this gathering."  

"We will move the treasure exchange forward and postpone the lecture to tomorrow. Please bear with us."  

Han Yue was surprised that two clearly non-human cultivators had managed to derail the event's proceedings—and that no one in the hall had objected.  

Something felt off. It was as though everyone was eagerly anticipating the auction of magical materials!  

With so little information at his disposal, Han Yue couldn't shake the feeling of being out of sync with the atmosphere.  

Before long, a massive crystal mirror was carried to the center of the hall. A young man in red robes stepped forward beside it and declared:  

"Greetings, fellow cultivators. I will oversee the exchange of magical items from this point onward."  

"The [Illusory Light Mirror] to my right is connected to the smaller mirrors in each of your booths."  

"Shortly, I will project the auction items onto the [Illusory Light Mirror]. You may place your bids through the mirrors in your possession!"  

"First up is the [Taiyi Mystic Light Talisman]. Starting bid: one thousand mid-grade spirit stones. Minimum increment: one hundred stones. Bidding will last for the time it takes an incense stick to burn. You may begin."  

As soon as the young man finished speaking, an image of a jade talisman appeared on the [Illusory Light Mirror], rendered in perfect detail as if the real item were present.  

The red-robed attendant lit an incense stick to mark the time.  

Han Yue picked up the small mirror beside him and, following the instructions, entered a bid of one thousand spirit stones.  

He executed his plan without hesitation, ready to raise his offer as long as it stayed within his budget.  

To his surprise, no one else placed a bid for a long while. Only as the incense neared its end did another participant make a single incremental offer.  

Han Yue quickly raised the bid to twelve hundred spirit stones—and then, silence.  

Just like that, he secured the first third-tier magical item at a price far lower than expected: a single-use offensive talisman!  

The auction's energy wasn't as heated as Han Yue had imagined, but obtaining his desired item below budget was still a pleasant outcome.  

Once the auction concluded, an assistant delivered the talisman to Han Yue's booth. He placed twelve hundred mid-grade spirit stones on the assistant's tray, finalizing the transaction.  

Next, the red-robed attendant presented the second item: a third-tier ore, [Dawn Gold].  

A fist-sized, black-and-gold-streaked stone appeared on the [Illusory Light Mirror].  

Han Yue was the first to bid again.  

This time, the [Dawn Gold] saw slightly more competition. The starting price of two thousand spirit stones quickly climbed past three thousand.  

Han Yue steadily increased his offer, securing the item at thirty-five hundred mid-grade spirit stones.  

The process felt effortless—his pre-set budget was far more generous than necessary!  

The following auctions for [Dawn Silver] and [Flame Within Stone] unfolded similarly. Though there were competing bids, Han Yue ultimately claimed both.  

In total, he spent less than ten thousand mid-grade spirit stones on the first four third-tier items—far below his initial estimates.  

Something still felt off. Even those who bid against him seemed hesitant, as if ready to withdraw at any moment.  

It was as though everyone was conserving their resources.  

But Han Yue paid no mind. Acquiring four third-tier treasures in a row had greatly enriched his collection!  

However, the atmosphere shifted dramatically when the fifth item was announced.  

The third-tier wonder, [Elixir Purification Water], could refine a second-tier cultivator's golden core, elevating its grade.  

This was a rare treasure that directly enhanced strength and expanded one's path—scarce in supply but immensely sought after.  

Before Han Yue could even input the two-thousand-spirit-stone starting bid, the price had already skyrocketed.  

At least fifty booths participated in the frenzy, driving the price past eight thousand mid-grade spirit stones before the bidding slowed.  

Even then, the price continued climbing until it peaked at twelve thousand.  

Han Yue watched the spectacle unfold, having long withdrawn from the competition as it surpassed his limit.  

The next item, [Emperor's Nectar], was even more outrageous.  

This third-tier treasure, which greatly enhanced bloodline cultivation for practitioners of the Blood Qi path, held immense value in Guizhou—a region dominated by such cultivators.  

Over a hundred booths placed bids, pushing the price above twenty thousand mid-grade spirit stones and marking the auction's first major climax.  

Han Yue finally understood: the cultivators here weren't short on funds—they were simply more selective, unlike him, who had splurged on items he might not even use.  

The [Emperor's Nectar] ultimately sold for a staggering twenty-eight thousand spirit stones, shattering Han Yue's expectations.  

Evidently, cultivation-enhancing treasures and the four items he had acquired, though all third-tier, belonged to entirely different value brackets.  

By now, only one third-tier item remained on Han Yue's pre-acquired list: the [Pure Sun Lamp].  

With over thirty thousand spirit stones still at his disposal, he pondered whether to increase his budget for the lamp—when another disruption arose in the hall!
