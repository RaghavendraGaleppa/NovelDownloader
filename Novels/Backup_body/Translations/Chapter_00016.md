# Chapter 16: So You're Li Zhengjing?

In the Public Affairs Hall.

"The demonic case in Qixing Prefecture?" The inner elder raised his brows and said, "According to the records, you've only been an inner disciple for half a month, correct?"

"Indeed," Li Zhengjing replied.

"The Qixing Prefecture incident has already claimed three lives, one of whom was a peak-level martial artist—a constable! If it involves demonic forces, the culprit must at least be at the Qi Refinement realm!" 

The elder shook his head slightly. "This task requires disciples at least at the mid or upper Qi Refinement realm. You've just entered this realm and may not even have stabilized your cultivation. If you encounter a Qi Refinement-level demon, you'll be walking to your death."

After speaking, he set the document aside and waved dismissively. "Go pick something safer. Youngsters shouldn't be so eager for merit that they throw caution to the wind! The tasks here are meant for training, not suicide missions!"

Every inner disciple was highly valued by the sect, especially someone like Li Zhengjing—young and having joined only half a year prior—who received implicit protection.

"Thank you for your concern, Elder," Li Zhengjing said softly. "But I believe I'm capable of handling this."

The elder fell silent for a moment before replying, "I only advised you because of your youth and talent. But if you insist, I can't stop you. By sect rules, you may take the task if you wish."

He waved his hand dismissively, thinking to himself, *Some fools just can't be saved, no matter how much you warn them. What a waste of the sect's resources!*

With a sigh, he concluded that a disciple who had only reached Qi Refinement half a month ago would be lucky to have stabilized their cultivation, let alone progressed further. But he had done his duty in warning.

Aware of the elder's goodwill, Li Zhengjing bowed before leaving the hall.

As he reviewed the document in his hand, he learned more about the case.

Among the three great immortal sects of the world, only the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect resided within the borders of the Great Zhou Dynasty. 

The sect's territory spanned six thousand li around Feather Transformation Mountain, divided into nine prefectures and seventy-two counties. All local officials within this region were appointed by the sect, subject to imperial approval.

*The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect is practically a state within a state,* Li Zhengjing mused. *In essence, these six thousand li are entirely under the sect's governance.*

The document also revealed that the deceased constable had been forty-four years old, a former outer disciple of the sect dispatched five years prior to serve in Qixing Prefecture. 

All minor officials within the sect's territory were former sect members—either demoted supervisors like Chen Youyu or disciples who had left due to age or other reasons.

These exiled disciples earned one hundred merit points for every five years of service without incident. Additional merits could be awarded for outstanding contributions, which could then be exchanged for cultivation resources—techniques, elixirs, talismans, formations, or rare herbs.

However, given the sect's peaceful domain, earning substantial merits was difficult, and advancing their cultivation outside the sect's spiritual veins was nearly impossible. Still, it offered them a sliver of hope.

"I'll set out for Qixing Prefecture tomorrow," Li Zhengjing decided. Then he added silently, *But first, I'll make a detour to Bailing Prefecture to deal with Chen Youyu.*

A glance at the golden page in his mind confirmed his fortune remained unchanged: *Killing him will bring great fortune—utterly foolproof!*

Returning to his courtyard, he noticed a squirming sack on the ground, with two roots emerging from the soil, attempting to untie the chains.

*The Five Elements Creation Tree is trying to escape?*

Furious, Li Zhengjing rushed over, pinned the sack down, and pummeled it seventeen or eighteen times.

"Master... I'll never do it again..." The roots flailed as the tree wailed pitifully, its cries enough to move any listener to tears.

"If there's a next time, I'll toss your entire body into the pot!" Li Zhengjing scolded. "I was planning to risk my life fighting demons to earn merits and exchange them for Mystic Breath Crimson Soil to nurture you! After all I've done for you, this is how you repay me? By trying to flee?"

"Do you have no conscience? Look within yourself—have I not treated you well? Have I beaten you recently?"

"You're just asking for it!"

Still seething, he delivered another round of punches.

The Five Elements Creation Tree flailed its roots in surrender, a pang of guilt stirring within. *The master hasn't beaten me lately... He even plans to find spirit soil for me... And here I was trying to run away... I really don't deserve his kindness... Wait, I'm not even human...*

After the beating, Li Zhengjing exhaled deeply. *Chains alone aren't enough. I'll have to take it with me when I leave the mountain, or it might escape and cause trouble.*

He packed his belongings and was about to resume cultivation when a voice called from outside the courtyard.

"It's Gao Changhe! Open the door!"

Li Zhengjing recognized the voice—it was the inner elder who had overseen his assessment. He opened the gate and bowed.

"I assigned you the safe task of compiling texts, yet you ignored it for half a month. Today, you dared to take on the Qixing Prefecture demon case!" 

The elder's expression was complex, tinged with anger. "Do you realize that case has already killed a peak-level martial artist? The culprit is at least at the Qi Refinement realm!"

"This task is meant for upper Qi Refinement disciples. You've just entered this realm—how can you possibly handle it?" His face darkened. "Are you trying to get yourself killed?"

Before Li Zhengjing could respond, the elder waved his sleeve. "Enough. The task is already assigned, so there's no point arguing. Just tell me—how confident are you?"

"At the very least, my life won't be in danger."

"Good." Elder Gao nodded slowly. "It seems your cultivation has progressed these past two weeks. I underestimated you."

Puzzled by the elder's words, Li Zhengjing waited silently.

Elder Gao continued calmly, "I knew of your existence the moment you entered the sect with Yuan Zhengfeng's token. I also knew Chen Youyu was suppressing you. But I didn't intervene. Do you know why?"

Li Zhengjing bowed slightly but remained silent, his eyes questioning.

"Yuan Zhengfeng was too upright and made many enemies. To the inner elders, a newcomer like you was insignificant."

"Scoundrels like Chen Youyu will always try to curry favor by targeting those out of favor. As an inner elder, I couldn't interfere directly in outer sect matters. Moreover, if I had openly protected you, you'd have drawn even more attention from the inner elders."

"At that point, not only would Yuan Zhengfeng's enemies target you, but so would those who oppose me. I'd be the only one shielding you, while multiple factions would seek to harm you just to spite me."

Elder Gao's tone was indifferent. "More importantly, you hadn't yet shown me talent worth protecting."

He clasped his hands behind his back. "My friendship with Yuan Zhengfeng wasn't enough for me to waste effort on a hopeless mediocrity. But now... you've proven yourself."

With that, he produced an object—a single feather.

"Since it's your first mission, I'll give you a life-saving talisman."

Li Zhengjing examined the feather curiously.

"Don't ask questions," Elder Gao said. "Consider this talisman something you chose for yourself."

"*I* chose it?" Li Zhengjing was baffled.

"Tonight, a distinguished guest will arrive—someone of high status and formidable ability. They're heading to Qixing Prefecture."

Elder Gao explained, "Since you've chosen the same destination, traveling together will ensure your safety."

Li Zhengjing hesitated. His plan to kill Chen Youyu would be complicated by an additional party. 

Just as he was about to refuse, Elder Gao added, "This guest's senior holds immense influence within the sect. Escorting them safely will earn you that elder's favor."

Li Zhengjing's interest was piqued. *An elder even an inner elder calls 'ancestor'—could they be a transcendent, immortal being?*

"Wait here. The guest will arrive soon." 

Before leaving, Elder Gao added sternly, "The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect is a blessed land of spiritual energy, where cultivation is twice as effective. Remember—in the future, choose tasks within the sect. Don't leave the mountain unless necessary."

"Understood." Li Zhengjing bowed as Elder Gao departed.

Anticipating the guest's arrival, Li Zhengjing dug up the Five Elements Creation Tree, gave it another beating, and stuffed it back into the sack to avoid detection.

By midnight, just as Li Zhengjing was nodding off, a streak of white light descended and landed on the stone table.

Before he could react, a childlike voice rang out from the light:

"So you're Li Zhengjing?"
