Chapter 395: Hundred Desires Peak

"Some interesting things are happening..."

Hundred Desires Peak was a place where desires were released to the extreme. According to Xu Tian, within the Primordial Origin Sect, many people on Hundred Desires Peak had extremely wild and twisted personalities.

"Who goes there?"

Two disciples in white robes emerged from behind a stone tablet, vigilantly sizing up Xu Yunfan.

The male disciple had lips as red as cinnabar and teeth as white as jade, with features as delicate as a painting. His robe hung loosely on his body, revealing half of his jade-like chest. His eyes shimmered with hidden charm, and a faint smile played on his lips. Every movement he made exuded a lazy, seductive aura.

The female disciple was cute and charming, with almond eyes and peach-like cheeks, her skin fairer than snow. Her waist was slender, her figure exquisite, and the curves beneath her robe were faintly visible. She lightly bit her red lips, her eyes filled with spring-like waters as her gaze roamed over Xu Yunfan, as if she were examining an amusing toy.

Standing together, their every frown and smile caused Xu Yunfan's blood and energy to stir slightly. The Ten Extremities True Qi unconsciously accelerated within his flesh and blood, as if pulled by some invisible force.

He was inwardly alarmed and quickly circulated the *Ten Extremities Martial Dao* to suppress the disturbance. He secretly thought that the disciples of Hundred Desires Peak were indeed strange; even their breathing carried a seductive power that could capture one's soul.

What made him feel even more cold inside was that when the male disciple saw Xu Yunfan's robust physique and his finely sculpted muscles, he actually winked at him.

Xu Yunfan calmly took out the Primordial Origin Token.

"I am Xu Yunfan, sent by the Peak Master of Hundred Desires Peak, Lady Hundred Flowers, to accept her as my master."

Hearing that it was Lady Hundred Flowers who had sent someone, the two disciples did not dare to be negligent.

One of them took the jade tablet to inspect it and frowned. "Strange, the jade tablet is correct, but I don't recall having someone like you in the peak?"

"I am from the Jietian Realm. I was fortunate enough to gain Lady Hundred Flowers' favor."

Xu Yunfan's smile remained unchanged. With his Foundation Establishment cultivation, it was natural to be able to trace his background. Rather than hiding it, it was better to admit it openly.

"So that's why... No wonder your physique is so令人馋得慌... Hehe..."

The female disciple stepped forward and lightly poked Xu Yunfan's chest with her fair finger. Even through the dragon scale armor, she could feel the hardness of Xu Yunfan's chest.

Instantly, her eyes rippled, and she let out a delicate moan. "Junior Brother, since you're here to accept a master, after registering, why don't you come find me? I'll teach you the introductory scriptures of Hundred Desires Peak."

The male disciple with a feminine appearance immediately became unhappy and cursed, "You shameless slut! Can't you see that Junior Brother is an upright person? How can you, a whore ridden by a thousand men and bowed to by ten thousand, dare to say such things?!"

Xu Yunfan: "..."

Watching the two fall into an argument, Xu Yunfan was somewhat speechless. He didn't want to waste any more time and quickly stepped past them, heading straight for Hundred Desires Peak.

The two disciples' voices suddenly stopped. They looked at Xu Yunfan, who had quickly disappeared from sight, their expressions filled with shock and some unease.

"This speed... isn't that the late stage of Qi Condensation?"

If they accidentally offended a disciple in the late stage of Qi Condensation, and that person had a narrow mind, they might die an unjust death tonight.

The male disciple also looked a bit dejected, muttering, "I didn't say anything..."

The mountain path of Hundred Desires Peak was winding and twisting, with pavilions and towers hidden among the green pines and cypress trees along the way.

The higher he went, the denser the spiritual energy became. By the time he reached the mountainside, a faint spiritual mist was visible in the air.

According to Xu Tian's description, the Hundred Desires Peak's Registration Pavilion was a three-story small building, with a drowsy old man sitting at the entrance.

Weren't there only handsome men and beautiful women on Hundred Desires Peak? Why was there an old man?

Xu Yunfan muttered to himself as he stepped forward to pay his respects and handed over his identity jade tablet.

"Hmm? A new disciple?"

The old man opened his turbid eyes and sized up Xu Yunfan. "It's not the time for recruiting disciples. How did you..."

He leaned forward slightly and lowered his voice. "Did you pull some strings?"

"Ahem... I found this Primordial Origin Token outside the sect."

The Primordial Origin Token was not inscribed with a name. As long as someone held it, they could naturally enter the sect to accept a master.

The old man immediately understood. The harmless-looking fellow in front of him must have obtained it by killing someone and seizing the treasure. He sat up straight and said indifferently, "Since you have the Primordial Origin Token, it's natural you can join my Hundred Desires Peak."

He cast a spell on the jade tablet and tossed it back to Xu Yunfan. "Go to the Miscellaneous Hall to get your residence key and this month's allowance. Since you have joined Hundred Desires Peak, you are naturally a disciple under Lady Hundred Flowers."

"Thank you, Elder."

The stone in Xu Yunfan's heart finally fell. He had thought the entry hurdle would be the hardest to pass, but it now seemed exceptionally easy, giving him an unreal feeling.

But on second thought, this was quite reasonable.

A great sect of the demonic path like the Primordial Origin Sect has always viewed its low-level disciples as weeds, mere consumables.

A disciple with an unknown origin and mysterious background like him is probably common within the sect; one more or one less makes no difference.

Moreover, once one steps into the gates of a demonic sect, it is like falling into an endless abyss. The brand of "demonic cultivator" will be impossible to escape in this lifetime.

Even if he wanted to switch sides in the future, the righteous path of the world would never accept him.

From now on, he could only walk the world under the name of the Primordial Origin Sect, with no way back.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan didn't care.

So what if it's a demonic sect? As long as he can become stronger, as long as he can achieve longevity, even if it means standing against the entire world, he will not hesitate.

Leaving the Registration Pavilion, Xu Yunfan followed the signs to the Miscellaneous Hall.

There was a long queue here, mostly low-level disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect coming to collect cultivation resources.

While queuing, he secretly observed his surroundings and found the atmosphere among the Primordial Origin Sect disciples to be quite strange. On the surface, it was orderly, but undercurrents were surging.

In just this short while, he had already witnessed several instances of silent confrontations with their eyes.

"Name."

When it was Xu Yunfan's turn, the steward behind the counter asked without looking up.

"Xu Yunfan, a new disciple."

The steward's hand paused, and he looked up to carefully examine Xu Yunfan. "Do you have proof?"

Xu Yunfan handed over his identity jade tablet.

After checking it was correct, the steward took out a bundle from under the counter. "This is your residence key and this month's allowance. As an outer disciple, you can receive ten lower-grade spirit stones and one bottle of Qi Gathering Pill each month."

Xu Yunfan took the bundle and was about to thank him and leave when he heard the steward coldly add:

"Remember, new disciples can collect their allowance for the first three months. After that, it must be exchanged with contribution points."

The steward flipped through his ledger without looking up and continued, "Hundred Desires Peak does not support idlers. You must complete at least one sect task per month. If you can't complete it, you can pay with contribution points. If there is no contribution record for three consecutive months..."

He suddenly looked up, a hint of a mocking smile flashing in his pupils as he looked at Xu Yunfan. "Hundred Desires Peak is always short of cultivation cauldrons."

Xu Yunfan frowned slightly, but saw the steward suddenly grin. "Of course, a Junior Brother with such a robust physique like you is most favored by the Senior Sisters of Hundred Desires Peak."
