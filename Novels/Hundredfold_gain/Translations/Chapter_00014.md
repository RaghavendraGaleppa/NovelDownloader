# Chapter 14: Qi Refinement Third Layer  

The Condensing Qi Pill dissolved the moment it entered Qi Chuan's mouth, transforming into a thick medicinal energy that surged through his limbs and bones.  

Without hesitation, Qi Chuan immediately activated the Evergreen Art.  

As his spiritual energy circulated, an attractive force emanated from his meridians. This force not only drew faint specks of spiritual energy from the surrounding void into his body through his breath and acupoints but also guided the dense medicinal energy within him, pulling it strand by strand into his meridians.  

Qi Chuan's original spiritual energy then enveloped this newly absorbed energy, circulating it through his meridians along a specific pathway. As it flowed, the spiritual and medicinal energies gradually assimilated into his own spiritual energy.  

By the time this energy finally returned to his dantian, it had grown noticeably stronger.  

**[You activated the Evergreen Art, absorbed spiritual energy, refined medicinal energy, and converted it into your own spiritual energy. Triggered 9x Critical Strike, gained 9x rewards. Your total spiritual energy increased slightly.]**  

Opening his eyes, Qi Chuan saw the words floating before him. He then checked his internal state and confirmed that his spiritual energy had indeed grown denser.  

This improvement was incomparable to his gains during the first layer of Qi Refinement. The boost came from both the Condensing Qi Pill and the 9x Critical Strike.  

Under normal circumstances, with his low-grade eighth-tier spiritual root, achieving even this modest improvement would have required an unimaginable amount of time and effort.  

"With this, my cultivation speed should be significantly faster now, right?" Qi Chuan mused.  

Closing his eyes again, he immersed himself in cultivation, no longer paying attention to the Critical Strike notifications. Whether he acknowledged them or not, the effects would trigger automatically.  

By the time he finished his day's cultivation, another notification appeared:  

**[You activated the Evergreen Art, absorbed spiritual energy, refined medicinal energy, and converted it into your own spiritual energy. Triggered 10x Critical Strike, gained 10x rewards. Your total spiritual energy increased slightly.]**  

This was the result of his final major cycle of the Evergreen Art, which didn't surprise him.  

Assessing his spiritual energy, he noted significant progress over the day. However, he was still far from breaking through to the third layer of Qi Refinement.  

The key wasn't just the progress—it was the remaining medicinal energy. Based on his estimation, over 80% of the pill's energy was still left in his body.  

After some quick calculations, Qi Chuan concluded that fully refining the remaining energy would take about seven or eight days.  

However, cultivation-enhancing pills couldn't be taken too frequently. At most, he could consume one per month. Otherwise, the buildup of pill toxins and bodily resistance would skyrocket, posing severe risks.  

"So, these eight Condensing Qi Pills will last me less than a year?" Qi Chuan muttered, though he wasn't overly concerned. Having enough resources to sustain his cultivation for that long was already a blessing.  

Next, he shifted his focus to practicing spells.  

**[You successfully cast Fireball once and maintained it for a period. Triggered 25x Critical Strike, gained 25x rewards. Your Fireball proficiency increased slightly.]**  

**[You successfully cast Water Arrow once and maintained it for a period. Triggered 19x Critical Strike, gained 19x rewards. Your Water Arrow proficiency increased slightly.]**  

**[You successfully cast Golden Skin once and maintained it for a period. Triggered 15x Critical Strike, gained 15x rewards. Your Golden Skin proficiency increased slightly.]**  

Through relentless practice, both Qi Chuan's cultivation and spell mastery advanced at a staggering pace.  

---  

Another year passed.  

By now, the commotion surrounding the secret realm had completely died down, and even the fifty-li restricted zone had reopened.  

Families that had previously withdrawn their forces and restricted their members' movements resumed their activities. Many even sent people to investigate the former site of the secret realm.  

However, to their frustration, the once-promising location now held nothing but a barren mountain range—completely stripped of any treasures or remnants of the secret realm.  

Some families grumbled internally—couldn't the Wind Moon Sect have left at least something behind? But there was nothing they could do. After all, who dared challenge a major sect like Wind Moon?  

They combed through every inch of the barren mountain and its surroundings, but found nothing.  

The frequent presence of cultivators in the area even led to violent clashes and incidents of robbery.  

Regardless, the matter of the secret realm was now truly over.  

Yet, contrary to expectations, the outside world didn't settle into peace. Instead, another major event sent shockwaves through the cultivation world—Wind Moon Sect was opening its gates for a disciple recruitment!  

The news instantly sparked endless discussions.  

Qi Chuan observed these external disturbances but never let them disrupt his cultivation. If anything, he trained even harder.  

Then, one day—  

**[You diligently cultivated, completing a major cycle of the Evergreen Art. Triggered 100x Critical Strike, gained 100x rewards. Your spiritual energy increased significantly. You have successfully advanced to the third layer of Qi Refinement.]**  

As Qi Chuan concluded his session, these words appeared before him.  

A faint breeze stirred in the quiet room, rustling his robe. The light in his eyes dimmed as he focused inward.  

His spiritual energy had reached a level only achievable at the third layer of Qi Refinement!  

"Finally broke through to the third layer. It wasn’t easy," Qi Chuan murmured, savoring the newfound strength.  

His stock of eight Condensing Qi Pills had been exhausted months ago. Since then, he had relied solely on sheer perseverance to progress.  

Now, after months of relentless effort and accumulated gains, he had smoothly broken through to the third layer—the final stage before mid-stage Qi Refinement.  

The density of his spiritual energy was now several times greater than when he was at the first layer, and his combat prowess had naturally soared.  

In the Qi Family, among over a hundred cultivators, excluding the Foundation Establishment patriarch, the handful of late-stage Qi Refinement elders, and the twenty or so mid-stage cultivators, the highest cultivation level among the remaining members was precisely this stage.  

Coupled with Qi Chuan's mastery of the five basic elemental spells, his combat strength was formidable. With a decent magical artifact or two, he would stand out even among early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.  

"But..."  

Qi Chuan formed a hand seal, and a crimson fireball materialized in his palm—the product of his Fireball spell.  

The fireball was now slightly larger than half a fist, and his casting speed had improved significantly since he first achieved minor mastery.  

Yet, despite these gains, his Fireball spell hadn't reached major mastery. There was still a considerable gap.  

"It seems the difference between minor and major mastery is much larger than I thought, making the breakthrough far more difficult."  

Over the past year, Qi Chuan had focused on cultivation during the seven or eight days after taking a Condensing Qi Pill each month. The rest of his time—especially in the latter months—had been devoted to spell practice.  

Given that his spell training often triggered higher Critical Strike multipliers than his cultivation, he had expected faster progress.  

Yet, major mastery remained elusive.  

But perhaps this was to be expected.  

After all, most low-level early or mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators might never achieve major mastery in any spell in their lifetime. Even minor mastery was rare.  

A major mastery Fireball spell could hold its own even among late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.  

And a perfected Fireball spell, wielded by a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator? That would be truly terrifying.
