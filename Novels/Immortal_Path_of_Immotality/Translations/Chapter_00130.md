# Chapter 129: Bloodfiend Gu

Lin Shan examined the red thread-like mass in his hand, watching as countless crimson worms wriggled and intertwined. This was the so-called "Bloodfiend Gu" that Old Man Zhong had mentioned.

According to him, these worms could help other gu insects evolve—though whether that was true remained to be seen. His enhancement panel couldn't analyze living creatures, but given Old Man Zhong's recent reliability and the fact that he was at his wit's end with the Devourer Gu, Lin Shan gritted his teeth and made a decision.

Under the astonished gazes of over a hundred onlookers, he plucked out a single tiny red worm, wrapped it in spiritual energy, and swallowed it whole. Using his spiritual power, he guided the worm into his dantian.

Inside his acupoint, the Devourer Gu had just finished feasting on white mist and was lazily lounging, half-asleep. Sensing the arrival of the new crimson gu, it cracked open its tiny eyes in surprise. But after a brief glance, it merely rolled over and continued its nap. Clearly, Lin Shan's earlier "feast" had exhausted its curiosity, leaving it uninterested in its new companion.

Disappointed but undeterred, Lin Shan reasoned that perhaps the quantity was insufficient. He sent ten more worms directly to the acupoint's entrance. This time, the Devourer Gu seemed to sense something peculiar. Its eyes fluttered open, blinking with confusion as it scrutinized the newcomers.

Encouraged, Lin Shan immediately pushed half of the remaining Bloodfiend Gu toward it. At last, the Devourer Gu's primal instincts kicked in. With a speed that defied logic, it somehow bypassed Lin Shan's Foundation Establishment barrier, darted out, and devoured the entire cluster of red worms before retreating back into the acupoint—all in the blink of an eye. It even licked its lips and glanced around with an intelligence that seemed far beyond a typical gu insect's dull nature.

Lin Shan was dumbfounded. For the first time ever, the creature had voluntarily left its acupoint. But more alarmingly, it appeared to possess considerable intelligence. Had all his previous attempts to lure it out been nothing more than a joke in its eyes?

Steeling himself, Lin Shan sent the remaining half of the Bloodfiend Gu into his dantian—this time keeping them far from the acupoint. His plan was simple: the moment the Devourer Gu emerged, he would strike it down for good.

Inside the acupoint, the Devourer Gu was still savoring its recent meal, its body tingling with satisfaction. When it spotted the new cluster of red worms in the distance, its eyes lit up with unmistakable delight, and its tiny tongue flicked out eagerly.

But its intelligence proved to be a double-edged sword. It hesitated, peering around cautiously as if sensing a trap. Lin Shan's dantian was a mesmerizing sight—a swirling vortex of azure spiritual energy, dotted with occasional silver sparks, resembling a miniature galaxy. Yet, the Devourer Gu's instincts eventually overpowered its caution. It shot out of the acupoint, charging toward the Bloodfiend Gu.

At that exact moment, all the silver sparks in the vortex converged. Lin Shan, using his spiritual sense, directed bolts of lightning toward the gu insect. These past days with the parasite in his acupoint had been torturous, each moment feeling like an eternity. Now that it was out, he was determined to obliterate it.

To his astonishment, the plump white worm displayed astonishing agility. It twisted and turned, slipping past every lightning bolt with uncanny precision, and in an instant, it had the red cluster in its grasp. With a crunch of its needle-like teeth, it devoured the worms and let out a satisfied chirp.

Furious, Lin Shan redirected all the lightning to form an impenetrable barrier around the acupoint. If he couldn't kill the worm, he could at least prevent it from returning. 

The Devourer Gu hesitated, assessing the situation. With spiritual energy surging toward it and the acupoint sealed off by lightning, it had no choice but to make a desperate dash back. As a gu insect bound by its master's will—Tortoise Sage's command to occupy Lin Shan's acupoint—it couldn't simply abandon its mission.

Lin Shan, now beyond caring about potential damage to his dantian, unleashed a storm of razor-sharp wind blades, intent on shredding the worm to pieces. Yet, the Devourer Gu, true to its reputation as Tortoise Sage's trump card, employed another mysterious ability—phasing in and out of a spiritual form. This was how it had initially bypassed Lin Shan's Foundation Establishment barrier to enter the acupoint.

Miraculously, it weaved through the tempest of blades and lightning, though not without cost. By the time it forced its way back into the acupoint, its once-pristine white body was charred and battered, its tail severed. Barely alive, it curled up, licking its wounds.

The entire ordeal had lasted mere seconds, leaving Lin Shan seething. What kind of gu insect was this? It defied all logic!

His dantian, brimming with Foundation Establishment-level spiritual energy, had failed to subdue a single worm. It was absurd.

Ignoring the bewildered stares of his followers, Lin Shan grabbed Old Man Zhong by the shoulders. "Do you have more Bloodfiend Gu?"

The old man gave him a strange look, his gaze flicking briefly toward Lin Shan's abdomen before shaking his head. "Not at the moment. If you can wait a month, I might be able to cultivate more."

A month? Lin Shan nearly lost his composure. The Devourer Gu, though severely injured, would undoubtedly recover and wreak havoc in his dantian long before then.

Just as despair threatened to set in, he noticed something in his dantian—a severed segment of the worm's tail, bobbing in the spiritual energy vortex, on the verge of dissolving. His eyes lit up.

If he couldn't force the gu out, perhaps he could curse it to death using the Nailhead Seven Arrows Art! He had used the technique on humans before, but never on a gu insect. There was no telling what might happen.

His first curse, cast on a Qi Condensation cultivator in the Great Song's capital, had birthed a monstrous eyeball. The second, targeting Bear Mountain's Foundation Establishment expert, summoned purple tentacles. If he cursed the Devourer Gu, what eldritch horror might manifest inside his acupoint? Would he be trading one nightmare for another?

But with no other options, Lin Shan decided to deal with the immediate threat first. He rose abruptly, ignoring his followers, and took to the skies on his sword. Success or failure would be decided tonight.

Whether the curse would work or not, he would find out soon enough.
