# Chapter 647: Time is Running Out, We Must Hurry

Xu Yunfan no longer looked at Him.

His gaze was cast toward the depths of the snow-covered ice plains in the distance, where resided the last High God of the凛冬 Northern Plains.

The Goddess of Ice and Snow, Anja.

Whether it was Locke Man or Buthus, Xu Yunfan did not care what they thought in their hearts. To him, it was of no consequence; he simply needed these few to open up the局面.

Locke Man and Buthus, one of ice and one of wind, were already firmly in his grasp.

"Locke Man," Xu Yunfan spoke.

"Your subordinate is here," Locke Man immediately stepped forward, his attitude respectful.

Having witnessed firsthand how Buthus was defeated and controlled without any ability to fight back under the Divine Thunder of the Celestial Firmament, his fear and obedience toward Xu Yunfan deepened.

"And the Frost Goddess, Anja."

Locke Man understood immediately and said, "The Goddess of Ice and Snow, Anja, rules over the Eternal Silent Glacier. Her divine realm is located in the Slumbering Ice Abyss at the northern pole of the plains. Her power is similar in nature to mine, but leans more towards stasis and slumber, and she holds a portion of the authority over Soul Frost. She is solitary and indifferent by nature, rarely participating in the disputes between me and Buthus, and her reliance on faith is relatively light. She does not have many gods under her command, but they are all Mid-Gods proficient in Frost magic. Her divine realm's defenses are extremely strong; it is said to be connected to an ancient source of primordial ice."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly.

A light reliance on faith meant she was likely more focused on delving deeper into her own authority, and her strength was probably even more troublesome than Locke Man and Buthus.

However, it also meant her follower base was small, and her divine power would be correspondingly scarce.

Even if her strength was formidable, she was likely just a "one-shot wonder."

The divine soul phantom of Buthus was also nearby, afraid that he wouldn't be able to drag others down with him. Since he was already in this state, he naturally couldn't stand the self-righteous Anja.

"That woman Anja is a madman," Buthus said. "She once tried to completely freeze the entire Slumbering Ice Abyss along with herself within the glacier, in pursuit of so-called Eternal Frozen Stillness. She is different from us; she has no interest in expansion, but her divine realm is almost the hardest bone to chew in the Northern Plains. Attacking her recklessly would cause too much commotion and would inevitably draw the attention of the Main God's will."

Buthus was adapting to his role quite well.

It sounded a bit interesting.

However, Buthus's words served as a reminder to him. A direct assault on Anja carried immense risk and could easily alert the Main God-level existence of the Natural God System prematurely.

After all, the conflict between the two High Gods, Buthus and Locke Man, was still somewhat controllable. But if they suddenly joined forces to attack another High God, it would inevitably attract the gaze of a Main God.

This was precisely what he needed to avoid at all costs.

What he needed was a controllable and larger-scale divine war to harvest gods, not to directly confront the most顶尖 existences of this world.

After all, the time left for him was running out.

He needed to create a time difference. Once he subjugated Anja, he could directly march to invade the neighboring human kingdom, the territory of the Bright God System.

This would提前引爆 the confrontation between the two great God Systems.

Sometimes, once a war starts, it easily forms a snowball effect.

After all, the Dark God System, which is天生 hostile to the Bright God System, would definitely seize the opportunity to act.

Moreover, it would also draw other High Gods of the Natural God System into the fray.

The human race has a massive population. With such a vast resource of incense and faith, anyone would want a piece of the pie.

Manipulating human hearts was something Xu Yunfan, who had studied deeply at the Primordial Origin Sect, was quite adept at.

The gods of this world lacked mental fortitude and mostly acted on their own desires, which was a lower-class approach.

This was why there were a large number of Mid-Gods and High Gods, yet only three Main Gods.

As for Qingyuan Zhenjun, Xu Yunfan was certain he was doing everything in his possible to track him down.

The other party was a Golden Core Zhenjun, with unfathomable methods. Although Xu Yunfan could temporarily wield the power of a Golden Core using the Supreme Yin Profound Mirror Dao Fruit, and the Star Spirit Banner's power had greatly increased, directly contending with a Golden Core Zhenjun was still an arduous task.

He had to, before the other party found him, seize as much Immortal Golden Nature as possible to enhance his strength, and even attempt to quickly return to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World to summon his clone, giving himself a chance to instantly冲击 Golden Core.

Thoughts whirled, and an even grander plan rapidly took shape in Xu Yunfan's mind.

He needed a super war that would sweep through the entire Natural God System, and even involve multiple God Systems.

"Buthus," Xu Yunfan looked at the divine soul phantom of the God of Gale, "Besides you, which other High Gods are on good terms with the Gale God System? Or, under your Main God, which other powerful God Systems are there?"

Buthus was taken aback, then immediately understood Xu Yunfan's intention, his face twitching slightly.

"Venerable Master, are you trying to...?"

He was truly startled by Xu Yunfan's ambition.

This alien demon from another realm seemed to want to reignite a divine war that would sweep across the entire continent in Aeterna.

Based on his previous actions, this家伙 wanted to harvest the divinity of the gods.

He couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart.

He seemed to be stepping towards the abyss.

"Answer," Xu Yunfan's voice held no temperature, but it sent a jolt through Buthus.

Buthus immediately said, "Above the Gale God System is the Lord of the Firmament, Orian. He wields the great power of the sky and atmosphere, and is the Main God of the Natural God System. Under Lord Orian, besides my Gale God System, there is the Fury of Thunder, Bal, who rules over the Thundering Mountain Range, and the Mother of Cloud and Mist, Sif, who commands the Endless Sea of Clouds. They are all extremely powerful High Gods. Bal's God System is several times stronger than mine at its peak."

Xu Yunfan quickly calculated in his mind and soon clarified his train of thought.

He looked afar and made eye contact with Zhang Ziyang, who was on a distant mountain peak at the edge, conveying his thoughts.

Zhang Ziyang nodded slightly in acknowledgment.

"Very good," Xu Yunfan's mind was instantly put at ease.

"Locke Man, Buthus, I need you to put on a show. A show grand enough to draw the attention of Bal, and even Orian, to the Winter God System."

He looked at the two High Gods under his control.

"Locke Man, you are to immediately return to the Eternal Frozen Court. In the most grief-stricken and indignant manner, lament to the other High Gods you know. Say that Buthus tore apart the tacit understanding of a truce and, in league with a powerful evil god suspected to be from the Starfall, set a trap. Not only did it severely injure you, but it also slaughtered all of your Mid-Gods and Low-Gods. You fought back with all your might and, although you severely injured Buthus thanks to the terrain advantage, you are now无力 to fight again. The foundation of the Winter God System in the Northern Plains is now in grave peril, and you beg for reinforcements to severely punish the Gale God System and the evil god behind it."

"Buthus," Xu Yunfan turned to the God of Gale, "You are to return to your Storm Divine Realm. In a similarly severely injured state, send the most urgent call for help to Bal, the High God you know. You are to accuse Locke Man of going mad with rage, colluding with an evil god who wields bizarre thunderous power, and setting up a spatial restriction array to ambush you. Their methods were vicious; they not only slaughtered all of your subordinate gods but also beat you to a severe injury, and boasted that their next target would be Bal, and that they would even challenge the authority of Lord Orian. You must emphasize that the evil god's thunder power is incredibly bizarre and powerful, and may have even stolen a portion of the authority over thunder."
