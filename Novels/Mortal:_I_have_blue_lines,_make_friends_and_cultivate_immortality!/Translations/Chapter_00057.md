# Chapter 57: "Lin Yun: 'Beg Me! Then I'll Save You!'"

"Are we still fighting?" Nangong Wan glared coldly at Lin Yun.

"You people from the Masked Moon Sect still have the face to ask?" Lin Yun snorted. "Wouldn't it have been better to just let me help Ancestor Li win his bet?"

"But no, you had to incite the other five sects to surround and kill me!"

"What does that have to do with me? I didn't know about it! Besides, Senior Brother Qiong has always acted however he pleases—he does whatever comes to mind without consulting anyone. If you're so brave, go take revenge on him!"

Nangong Wan retorted angrily.

"Hmph—he'll die by my hand sooner or later!" Lin Yun sneered.

As Lin Yun and Nangong Wan faced off, the Black Flood Dragon in the swamp had already completed its third molting. Its strength had increased yet again.

"ROAR—"

With a furious roar, it suddenly burst out of the swamp.

"Damn it—this beast recovered so quickly!" Nangong Wan had nearly forgotten about the lurking second-stage Black Flood Dragon due to Lin Yun's sudden appearance.

"Hey, Lin Yun! This second-stage Black Flood Dragon isn't easy to deal with. Let's work together to take it down. I promise all grievances between you and the Masked Moon Sect will be settled, and no one will come after you later. How about it?"

Nangong Wan knew she couldn't handle the flood dragon alone. After molting, its defenses had reached an unbelievable level. Whether she used her Vermilion Bird Ring to blast it with flames or struck it directly with the treasure itself, she couldn't inflict significant damage.

The main reason, of course, was that her cultivation had regressed to the Qi Condensation stage. If she were at the Core Formation stage—no, even the Foundation Establishment stage would suffice—but she was stuck at Qi Condensation.

Reluctantly, she had to swallow her pride and ask Lin Yun for help.

"With such a formidable enemy before us, surely he'll agree," Nangong Wan thought to herself.

"No—I refuse to work with anyone from the Masked Moon Sect." Lin Yun turned his head away without hesitation.

"Are you stupid?" His response stunned Nangong Wan. "Do you think it'll spare you after devouring me?!"

"This underground space is collapsing everywhere—there's nowhere left to hide!"

"Or do you really think you can take this thing on alone?"

"Even I, a Core Formation cultivator, can't handle it. Do you think a mere Qi Condensation cultivator like you can—" Just as Nangong Wan was trying to persuade Lin Yun to set aside their feud and focus on the beast, she suddenly froze.

Lin Yun stretched out his palm, revealing five small, pale-blue orbs crackling with lightning.

"Sky Thunder Beads! Five of them!" Nangong Wan was shocked. "Where did you get so many Sky Thunder Beads?!"

"None of your business!" Lin Yun smirked. "Well? Is this enough?"

"Haha—speechless, aren't you?"

Lin Yun burst into laughter.

Meanwhile, the Black Flood Dragon charged at them. Nangong Wan dodged with a mid-grade Earth Escape Talisman, but her supply of talismans was nearly exhausted. Worse, the range of a mid-grade talisman wasn't enough to escape the collapsing mountain.

As the flood dragon lunged at him, Lin Yun clapped his hands together, summoning the Giant Tortoise Shield and the True Wood Shield to block the impact.

"BOOM—"

"This beast is strong! Its power is nothing like Qiaoqian's." Lin Yun frowned. He had underestimated the flood dragon.

He had tested his strength against Chen Qiaoqian before. Thanks to cultivating the Profound Heaven Five Spirits Art—which combined five basic techniques—his spiritual power was on par with Foundation Establishment cultivators in both quantity and purity.

Moreover, he had completed the first and second layers of the Vajra Art.

Yet, even with all that, he still struggled against the flood dragon. Truly, the elite among demonic beasts—especially a molted flood dragon—was far stronger than he'd expected. The might of draconic creatures was no joke!

"HAH—" Lin Yun slapped a Strength Talisman onto his arm, then leaped out from behind his shields and punched the flood dragon, sending it flying.

"ROOOAR—" The dragon howled in pain as its scaled head caved in from the blow, its massive body crashing to the ground.

"He sent a second-stage Black Flood Dragon flying?!" Nangong Wan was dumbfounded. "Is this guy even human?"

And he was only at Qi Condensation!

"Oof—that hurt!" Lin Yun examined his swollen fist. "Seems the first two layers of the Vajra Art aren't enough. I need the third layer."

The flood dragon writhed back to its feet, eyeing Lin Yun warily. Yet, its gaze was also filled with greed—its instincts screamed that something within Lin Yun could help it evolve further, igniting its bloodline.

"Why's it staring at me after getting punched? Something's off." Lin Yun frowned.

The dragon coiled itself, then lunged at Lin Yun again, jaws wide.

Nangong Wan, now free to recover some spiritual power, watched curiously. Why was the flood dragon so fixated on Lin Yun? Did he possess some treasure that attracted it?

"Need my help now?" she teased through a voice transmission.

"Not a chance!" Lin Yun snapped.

"Still coming at me?!"

"Take this!" He hurled a Sky Thunder Bead.

"BOOM—" The explosion lit up the cramped cavern, arcs of lightning dancing across the walls. The confined space, now reinforced by the earlier collapse, amplified the blast.

He hadn't thrown all five beads—he still needed the flood dragon to pressure Nangong Wan for his reward.

"SCREECH—" The flood dragon's back was torn open by the blast. Realizing Lin Yun was too dangerous, it turned and charged at Nangong Wan instead.

"Wretched beast!"

She summoned her Vermilion Bird Ring, but the flood dragon spat black liquid at it. The treasure dimmed instantly upon contact.

Though it could recover with time and Core Flame refinement, its power was temporarily crippled.

Nangong Wan had lost her last resort!

"Still watching?!"

"Save me already!"

"Now you know how it feels to be left hanging!"

Lin Yun's mocking voice echoed through the cavern.

"You—"

Cornered, Nangong Wan was truly desperate. The flood dragon had backed her into a dead end with no escape.

"Help me!" she screamed.

"Beg me first. If you beg, I'll save you." Lin Yun pressed further.

"Bastard—don't push me! Even if I can't fight back now, the Maiden Reincarnation Art I cultivate has a soul-possession technique!"

"If this beast eats me, I'll possess its body and regain my Core Formation strength!"

"Then even your Sky Thunder Beads won't save you!" she threatened.

"I said, beg me, and I'll save you. As for possessing the flood dragon—go ahead." Lin Yun remained unmoved.

"You—" Nangong Wan was livid. As a revered Core Formation elder, she had never suffered such humiliation!

It was true she could use the possession technique, but doing so would trap her in a beast's body forever.

She'd rather die!

"Tsk, tsk. Imagine—a Core Formation elder turning into a Black Flood Dragon. Would you be called a 'dragon-human' or a 'human-dragon'? Would you seek a male or female mate? Sounds fascinating." Lin Yun grinned.

"P-please... help me." A whisper escaped her lips.

"Louder! I can't hear you!" Lin Yun teased.

"You—"

"HELP ME!" Nangong Wan screamed, eyes shut tight.

"Lin only helps his friends. You're not my friend—I won't help." He smirked. "If you're willing to befriend me, I'll save you."

"Fine! I'll be your friend!"

"Hurry! I can't hold out much longer!" Her last defense—a brocade handkerchief, a top-grade artifact—was corroding under the flood dragon's venom.

[Ding. Nangong Wan has sent you a friend request.]  
[Ding. Nangong Wan is now your friend. You may draw two rewards from her.]
