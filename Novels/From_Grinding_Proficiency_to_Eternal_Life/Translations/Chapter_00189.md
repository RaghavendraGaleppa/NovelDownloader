# Chapter 189: The Mysterious Realm of Profound Truth?

Since Bao Yan of the Cangfeng Pavilion was revealed to be an agent of the Great Zhou Imperial Court, the position of Pavilion Master has remained vacant.

As Bao Yan's direct subordinate, Qi Huan was naturally marginalized, intentionally or otherwise. Qi Huan was quite sensible and did not seek the spotlight in various situations, instead conscientiously fulfilling his duties.

At least during this period, the other departments had developed a much better impression of him.

If nothing unexpected happened, once Qi Huan stepped into the Muscle Refining Realm, the position of department head might very well fall to him next.

How could such a rational person get involved with Pei Yan?

Xu Yunfan's mind raced with thoughts, but his expression remained unchanged. He smiled and said, "I wonder what good news has brought Senior Brother Qi here personally, bringing this Walking Commissioner Pei along."

Qi Huan naturally detected the sarcastic undertone in Xu Yunfan's words, but he pretended not to notice, his face still serious. "The Five-Yearly Sects Exhibition of Lingnan Dao is approaching. If we can secure a ranking, Junior Brother Xu, not only will the Xuanzhen Sect bestow elixirs, but there will also be many divine arts and peerless techniques. As an external sect, if we wish to integrate into the martial world of Lingnan Dao, we naturally need to participate."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow slightly upon hearing this; he wasn't surprised. He had known previously that the Nine Luminaries Sect held a similar event every five years in Yanbei Dao, inviting the martial artists of Yanbei Dao to participate.

Calculating the dates, he hadn't expected that Lingnan Dao and the Nine Luminaries Sect would hold their events almost simultaneously. From his master, Zhan Yan, he had learned that during the Sects Exhibition, the other five major peak sects rarely sent disciples to participate in other Dao states. If they did come, it was almost equivalent to challenging the host sect.

The matter could be minor or major.

Now, the Walking Commissioner of the Sword Pavilion, which dominates Jiangnan Dao, had crossed the Dao to come here, which was quite intriguing.

Sensing the atmosphere, Pei Yan took the conversation over. His tone was gentle but carried an unmistakable excitement.

"Brother Xu, this exhibition is no small matter. Lingnan Dao is the birthplace of the Xuanzhen Sect, where the martial path is flourishing and sects are numerous."

"The Five-Yearly Sects Exhibition gathers elite disciples from Lingnan Dao and even the surrounding major sects. It is an excellent opportunity to showcase strength and exchange martial arts."

Xu Yunfan smiled faintly and politely declined. "Commissioner Pei makes a valid point, but how could such a grand event involve a nameless person like me?"

He was joking. He wouldn't step out of the mountain gate for anything right now. With the Ginseng Baby in hand, he planned to cultivate the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art to perfection before considering leaving. If possible, he even hoped to learn the Sect Master's ultimate technique.

Going out to show off now would be sheer foolishness.

Pei Yan shook his head. "Junior Brother Xu, you are too humble. I observe that your martial arts are extraordinary, especially just now; you were practicing the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art. To be able to perform it at the External Three Unifications Realm is naturally extraordinary. Moreover, possessing the Heavenly Art of Forging makes you a rare talent."

"Many sects are looking for potential disciples during this exhibition. If you can stand out, your future achievements are limitless."

Qi Huan also chimed in from the side. "Commissioner Pei is absolutely right. Junior Brother Xu, you might not know this, but the rewards for this exhibition are incredibly generous. Besides the elixirs and peerless techniques from the Xuanzhen Sect, the top twenty have the chance to enter the Mysterious Realm of Profound Truth for cultivation."

"The Mysterious Realm of Profound Truth?"

Xu Yunfan was a bit curious.

Pei Yan explained, "With the initial rise of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, though not abundant, some forces transcending the mortal world have awakened. The Mysterious Realm of Profound Truth is a cultivation sanctuary sealed by the Qingyue Xuanzhen Taoist Temple two thousand years ago. It is said to contain boundless spiritual energy and many divine arts and precious herbs; naturally, opportunities are countless."

"The realm has not yet fully opened, and few within the Xuanzhen Taoist Temple can operate the formation, which gives us this chance. As long as one's bone age does not exceed twenty-five and they win a place in the top twenty of this exhibition, they may enter. Of course, upon returning, whether it is a peerless technique or an elixir, one must present the original to the Xuanzhen Sect and keep a copy, or split the elixir in half. This is a heaven-sent opportunity."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but be slightly moved.

But unfortunately, I have the Ginseng Baby in hand, which drives even Qi Refining Grandmasters crazy. Why should I take this risk?

He looked at Qi Huan and suddenly smiled. "Senior Brother Qi has contributed the most to the Heavenly Art Cave. With your exceptional talent, you will surely secure a ranking for the Heavenly Art Cave. I'll wait for the next time, next time."

Qi Huan was slightly stunned, seemingly never expecting Xu Yunfan to say such a thing.

Logically speaking, within the Xuanzhen Sect, including inner and outer disciples and true disciples, they couldn't even gather twenty disciples under the age of twenty-five in the Muscle Refining Realm. There might even be Blood Transformation experts among them.

The six major peak sects of Great Zhou are all selfish to the core. If there were no benefit, would they be so kind?

When the Heavenly Art Cave first settled in Lingnan Dao, if it weren't for being a major weapon-forging sect with countless skilled craftsmen, it wouldn't have been easy to reopen the mountain and establish a sect here.

For this, Sect Master Hong Baichuan used his personal connections and brought a treasure weapon from the Heavenly Art Cave's reserves to pay respects before gaining the Xuanzhen Sect's current attitude.

With the spiritual energy of heaven and earth just beginning to surge, is the Xuanzhen Sect really so generous as to let others explore its secret realm?

Xu Yunfan remained noncommittal. No matter how the two tried to persuade him, he continued to politely decline.

Finally...

"Junior Brother Xu, are you truly not interested in this opportunity?" Qi Huan's voice carried a deep sense of regret.

When Xu Yunfan looked up, the clock on the highest tower in Heavenly Art City was nearing noon.

He picked up his hand and gestured for the disciple bringing food to place the meal on the stone table in the courtyard. As he opened the food box, a rich aroma mixed with steaming heat rose to his brow. "I have reached a bottleneck in my cultivation. I need to contemplate the changes in my strength day and night and dare not step over the threshold."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's insistence, Pei Yan and Qi Huan left.

As Qi Huan left, he gave Xu Yunfan a deep look and left silently, following Pei Yan.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly. From Qi Huan's gaze, he saw a hint of greed.

The way he looked at him was filled with a trace of avarice...

A month passed in a flash. The setting sun poured onto Xu Yunfan's back, and the rising white mist carried three withered maple leaves into the medicinal pool.

The Ginseng Baby struggled, baring its teeth and breathing out a rust-colored, sweet-smelling essence.

Xu Yunfan exhaled two white streams from his nose, and the Qi force shattered the withered leaf drifting toward his glabella.

The copper bell hanging from the eaves swayed gently, the wind carrying a chill like shards of ice, reminding him that today was the third waning moon after the Cold Clothing Festival.

As the twilight soaked into the blood scabs under his ribs, the opening stance of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art had already shattered a half-rotted ginkgo tree seven zhang away.

Where the Red Serpent Mountain-Surrounding Strength flowed, the ochre-yellow leaves on the ground formed a vortex within the Qi waves. The leaf blades cutting through the twilight revealed the outline of the Hundred-Forged Steel Body, the bulging muscles resembling old kiln pottery waiting to be crazed.

The Hundred-Forged Steel Body is an advanced technique of the Copper Body Skill, requiring the method of casting both inside and out,配合 with many rare medicinal baths for tempering.

That medicinal pool was specifically dug by Fu Jin, allowing the Heavenly Art Department disciples to let Xu Yunfan soak in it immediately after completing his Hundred-Forged Steel Body cultivation.
