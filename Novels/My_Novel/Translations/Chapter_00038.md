# Chapter 38: Perceiving the Wind and Returning to Qingning

"This is for the rouge. Take good care of it."

Pang Long tossed a pouch over.

"Pang..."

Li Xian wanted to ask more, but Pang Long let out a heavy sigh and turned to enter the manor.

Looking around, the world was pitch black.

Buying rouge in this situation was like a fool's dream—more difficult than climbing to the heavens.

The One Union Manor was over thirty miles from Qingning County. Although it wasn't a mountain road, it was a government road paved with fine gravel and sand.

However, the heavy snow had long since buried the path.

Unable to find the way, if he ventured out, he would surely lose his direction.

Li Xian sorted out the situation and let out a soft breath.

He forced himself to calm down and thought of a countermeasure.

"I am still at the manor's entrance, with reference points, so I know the directions of east, south, west, and north. Once I walk into the snowstorm, there will be no more reference points."

Regardless, he first put on his beast-fur cloak to maintain body heat as much as possible.

"This pouch feels soft and cold; it should be the Madam's."

He opened the pouch, finding three taels of silver inside.

Although the world was chaotic, cosmetics were incredibly expensive. These three to five taels of silver could buy rouge, but not truly high-quality rouge.

"It seems the drinker's intention is not the wine, but the water."

Li Xian put the pouch away. Seeing the manor gate was tightly shut, he knew staying any longer was useless. So, holding his oil lamp, he first followed the perimeter wall.

He walked over a mile to a corner. Li Xian knew that if he continued following the wall, he would just circle the manor and never reach Qingning County.

"How to break through?"

Li Xian emptied his mind, calming himself...

Suddenly, an idea struck him.

In this environment, his eyes were useless.

What was truly useful was his skin and his senses.

"If I walk east, I will reach Qingning County. The difficulty lies in how I can keep walking east without going wrong."

"Eyes are useless, ears are useless... The only things useful are 'memory' and 'feeling'!"

Li Xian stretched out his hands flat, sensing the wind direction.

At this moment, he hadn't lost his direction; he knew where the cardinal directions were.

There was a faint resistance ahead, blowing from the east. A moment later, the wind shifted, turning into a south wind...

The wind direction was constantly changing.

"Fortunately, I learned the Four Directions Fist. Applying its principles here is the perfect way to break through."

"I will use my body as a flag, sensing the great winds from all sides, treating the wind as enemies from every direction."

"First, remember the initial wind direction, then, based on the changes in the wind's angle, I can deduce which way the wind is blowing at any given moment, and thus use the wind direction as a reference to determine the east, south, west, and north directions."

"As long as I constantly determine the wind direction, I won't get lost in the snowstorm."

Simply put, since the world is devoid of objects and pitch black, the wind is the only reference.

But the wind changes at every moment. Once inside the snowstorm, one cannot even distinguish east from south, so how can one distinguish the direction of the wind?

Moreover, the wind can push one's steps astray, causing one to turn without realizing it.

To keep walking east is incredibly difficult.

The only way is to firmly remember the initial wind direction, and then, based on the sensations in the wind, deduce the new wind direction in real time.

To find this "flowing," only reference point within the vast snowstorm.

Li Xian took a deep breath.

He calmed his mind and thought of nothing else. He took a step forward, entering the snowstorm.

The wind suddenly shifted, blowing from the southwest.

"It's a southwest wind!"

Using the wind as his compass, he determined the location of the east and stepped forward towards the east.

"It's changed... now it's a southeast wind..."

He determined his direction again.

The hardest part of this method lay in "memory" and "confidence."

Even if the method was feasible, walking alone in such an environment would inevitably make one's mind suspicious and one's thoughts drift.

Any slight error, oversight, or loss of focus along the way could lead to a complete misjudgment, causing one to circle around unconsciously and become completely lost.

Li Xian closed his eyes, abandoned his senses, and steeled his resolve.

He turned the wind that disrupted his direction into a marker that locked his direction.

He took step after step, walking for an unknown length of time.

"This is..."

When he opened his eyes again, he saw the towering city gate of "Qingning County" standing right before him.

"I succeeded!"

Li Xian was ecstatic, no different from escaping death. He leaned against the city wall and followed it. Not far away, he saw a dog hole.

He threw two punches, his internal energy vibrated, scattering the snow blocking the dog hole.

He crawled through the hole and successfully entered the city.

"The Madam specifically sent me to buy rouge; what was her true intention?"

"Was it to silence me? Or was there another purpose?"

Li Xian saw a horse stable. He used his "Treading on Snow" ability to lightly leap over the fence, using the stable to rest properly.

On such a windy and snowy day, Qingning County's gates were all closed.

"Perhaps, I should take this opportunity to run away? From now on, I would be free, go to another place, and find a new path?"

A strong desire surged within Li Xian.

Just then, he sensed something, as if a gaze was fixed on him.

He looked around, but there was no sign of anyone.

"No..." Li Xian secretly warned himself: "She sent me out in a snowstorm to buy rouge; there must be another purpose. If I run away now, perhaps... that would truly invite a fatal disaster!"

He pulled himself together.

He circulated his internal energy throughout his body, restoring warmth to his frozen hands and feet.

"If I didn't have internal energy, I would have died from hypothermia long ago."

Li Xian muttered to himself. Since he was already here, he might as well take a look at Leaking Bottle Alley.

He saw the dilapidated houses, the thatched roofs blown away by the strong wind. Fortunately, his younger brother had already left, so he didn't have to suffer the cold here.

The Liu Aunty family next door had their roof reinforced with mud and covered with some wood.

It was barely able to withstand the strong wind.

The house was lit with fire, the family of three huddled together on a warm heated kang.

Li Xian's mood improved considerably. He left Leaking Bottle Alley and felt his way along the houses.

"This oil lamp is quite magical; the strong wind can't blow it out."

Although it could illuminate the surroundings, it wasn't enough to provide warmth.

There were many houses in the county, and many reference points, so he wouldn't get lost. Li Xian identified the names of the streets and alleys through several tall buildings.

"Water Gauze Alley..."

"This is the place!"

If one were to ask where to buy cosmetics in Qingning County, it would be "Water Gauze Alley" next to "Red Candle Alley."

Red Candle Alley was a place of nightly revelry, a place of romance and pleasure. Water Gauze Alley was a street for selling silk, satin, cosmetics, and decorative items.

It was completely different from Leaking Bottle Alley.

The ground was paved with blue bricks. When it was bustling, the lights were bright, and delicacies from land and sea were so abundant that leftovers were simply thrown on the ground.

But they wouldn't give them to beggars.

Each building hired several thugs.

Whoever dared to pick up leftovers would be beaten. They just wouldn't give you anything to eat; what could you do?

However, the snow had accumulated like a blanket, and the blue bricks were no longer visible.

"Dream Immortal Pavilion"

"I'll buy it here."

Li Xian knocked on the door but got no response. He immediately knocked heavily again.

Bang, bang—

It was a long while before someone answered.

"Get lost, get lost! Freeze to death somewhere else! You think this old lady will bury you? No way!"

The voice was quite sharp.

"Open the door, I'm here to do business."

Li Xian raised his internal energy and shouted with full voice.

After a long while, the door was pulled open a crack, and an eye peered through the gap. "Sir, in the dead of winter, you haven't gone to the wrong place, have you?"

The tone became much more polite.

Li Xian said in a deep voice, "This is the place. I want to buy rouge."

"You really want to buy rouge?" the woman asked.

"What else?" Li Xian brushed the snow off his body.

"Alright then, come in." The woman opened a gap. Li Xian squeezed his way in, and the door was closed again.

The room was very warm.

Several stoves were burning. Li Xian took off his cloak, shook the snow from his hair, and then began to observe the other person.

She was a middle-aged woman in her forties, quite plump, holding a red and green handkerchief, and carrying a strong scent of perfume.

"Oh, oh, oh, it's a young master."

After seeing Li Xian clearly, the middle-aged woman relaxed a lot.

It turned out to be a greenhorn.

"What kinds of cosmetics do you have here? Give me an introduction." Li Xian stretched out his hands and warmed them by the stove.

"Cosmetics, oh, there are plenty," the woman giggled. "Young master, follow me."
