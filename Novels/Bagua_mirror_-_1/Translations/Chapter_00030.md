# Chapter 30: Forming a Team

Unfortunately, Qin Chong's joy was premature. By the time he returned to the surface, all he had gained were those two storage pouches.  

However, this was precisely the time when cultivators were returning to the surface to hand over their spirit stones, so the two pouches likely contained a considerable amount.  

Before emerging, Qin Chong had already transferred the useful items into his Bagua space, while the empty pouches were casually discarded in two inconspicuous side tunnels.  

This effectively erased all traces. As long as his Bagua space remained undiscovered, no one would suspect him.  

Acting as if nothing had happened, Qin Chong went to submit his spirit stones while discreetly gathering information. For the Qi Refinement cultivators working in the mines, three Violet-Striped Earth Scorpions were indeed formidable opponents.  

But on the surface, where several Foundation Establishment cultivators stood guard, such low-level late-stage first-rank demon beasts were insignificant.  

To avoid trouble, Qin Chong had deliberately delayed his return by a few hours.  

At the submission point, he learned that the three demon beasts had been slain by the Foundation Establishment cultivators, though five or six miners had perished in the incident.  

Occasionally, one or two low-level demon beasts appearing in the mines wasn’t unusual, but the simultaneous emergence of three late-stage first-rank creatures was abnormal.  

Upon returning to his quarters, Qin Chong received a new directive:  

For the next half-month, no one was permitted to enter the mines. Several Foundation Establishment cultivators would investigate the incident. To Qin Chong, this was no hardship—just a forced break.  

However, the thought of Foundation Establishment cultivators entering the mines made him uneasy. His hasty disposal of the two storage pouches now seemed careless.  

If they were discovered, would he be implicated?  

It was too late now. He could only resign himself to fate.  

Besides, all the spirit stones he had taken from the mine were safely stored in his Bagua space. As long as he didn’t recklessly display them, there would be no evidence against him.  

For now, this was the only comfort he could offer himself.  

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye. Qin Chong didn’t know the outcome of the investigation, but new regulations were announced: from now on, miners would work in teams of three.  

However, these teams weren’t self-selected—they were assigned by the overseers.  

Qin Chong’s notification listed two names: Song Jinpeng and Liao Xiong. No additional details were provided. He would have to wait until they met to learn their ages and cultivation levels.

The next morning, as Qin Chong stepped out of his quarters, two cultivators approached him—his new teammates.  

"You must be Fellow Daoist Qin Chong?" The speaker was Song Jinpeng.  

The man was burly, roughly the same height as Qin Chong but twice as wide. Liao Xiong, on the other hand, stood a head taller than Song Jinpeng, with a similarly robust build and a simple, honest demeanor.  

"Indeed, I am Qin Chong. You two must be Fellow Daoists Song and Liao?" Noting that both were at the seventh level of Qi Refinement, Qin Chong greeted them respectfully.  

"Haha, I’m Song Jinpeng, and this is Fellow Daoist Liao Xiong."  

Clearly, Song Jinpeng was a talkative, sociable type, while Liao Xiong was taciturn, merely nodding in acknowledgment of Qin Chong’s greeting.  

"I’ll be relying on your guidance from now on."  

"Don’t mention it! Since you were just heading out, and we’ve come to find you, why don’t we descend into the mines now if it’s convenient?"  

"I was actually about to look for you both."  

"Then let’s go. We can chat along the way."  

The trio set off together, re-entering the mining tunnels.  

Throughout the journey, Song Jinpeng barely stopped talking, eventually reducing Qin Chong to monosyllabic responses. It was exhausting.  

Despite the incessant chatter, Qin Chong did glean useful information.  

"Fellow Daoist Song, do you know the results of the investigation?"  

"I don’t have specifics, but I heard some rumors from a few Canglong Valley disciples. That’s why we’re being grouped into teams now."  

"Oh?"  

"Rumor has it that the Qingxuan Sect is behind this. The mining rights to the Cangwu Vein currently belong to Canglong Valley, but the deposits are nearly exhausted. Qingxuan Sect is getting restless."  

"So those three demon beasts were deliberately released by Qingxuan Sect members?"  

"Not just demon beasts—they’ve also recruited rogue Qi Refinement cultivators to disrupt Canglong Valley’s operations and skim profits for themselves."  

"Qingxuan Sect would stoop so low?"  

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Qin, you’re still young and inexperienced. Not only major sects but even minor cultivation families will do anything to secure resources."  

From this, Qin Chong deduced that Song and Liao were likely rogue cultivators.  

"Will we be in danger down there?"  

"There’s always risk, but Qingxuan Sect won’t act too brazenly. Their operatives are probably around our level. As long as we stick together, we should manage."  

"With my low cultivation, I fear I’ll hold you both back."  

"Don’t worry. The tunnels are vast—chances of running into trouble are slim. And even if we’re outmatched, we can always flee."  

Song Jinpeng clearly had an exit strategy, but Qin Chong had no intention of entrusting his safety entirely to these two. If push came to shove, he wouldn’t hesitate to reveal his true strength to survive.  

Two days later, the trio reached a mining site and began extracting spirit stones.  

This particular spot had been discovered earlier by Song Jinpeng. Now that they were teaming up, there was no point in keeping it secret—especially with Qingxuan Sect cultivators potentially lurking about. Leaving the stones unclaimed would only benefit outsiders.  

However, Qin Chong found it frustrating to operate under his teammates’ watchful eyes. He could only discreetly transfer stones into his Bagua space while they rested to recover their energy.  

The two storage pouches he’d scavenged had contained over two thousand low-grade spirit stones, but he couldn’t use them yet—not until their residual energy signatures faded. Otherwise, if Canglong Valley discovered them, he’d be in serious trouble.  

Working with someone like Song Jinpeng had its perks—boredom was never an issue. The downside was the occasional noise pollution.  

Three months passed without incident. The team’s mining efforts proceeded smoothly, and their haul was decent. Yet, an uneasy tension began permeating the entire mining zone.  

Canglong Valley seemed to be deploying more personnel. Disciples who had previously avoided the mines now ventured deep underground in squads of five or six, each led by a Foundation Establishment cultivator, patrolling the tunnels.  

At the first sign of trouble, nearby patrols would rush to assist.  

Qin Chong sensed a storm brewing. Would his spirit-stone profiteering scheme soon come to an end?
