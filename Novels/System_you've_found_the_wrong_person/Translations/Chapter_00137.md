# Chapter 136: Three Treasures, the Golden Hoop!

Coming to Changzhou had two main purposes.

The first was the Tiger Soul Saber, and the second was the fragment of the Colossus Armament blueprint.  

So far, there had been no news regarding either of these matters. Yan Jiutian, the previous wielder of the Tiger Soul Saber, was still alive. Trying to seize the saber now would be like snatching food from a tiger's mouth—Dou Changsheng had already given up on that idea. As for the fragment of the Colossus Armament blueprint, he had no leads either.
