Chapter 149: Drawing the Ice Cube!

“Junior Brother, please don’t do anything reckless!”

When Li Mo said he wanted to learn painting to draw for himself, Ouyang leaned back, his face turning pale with shock.

“What’s the problem?”

Li Mo didn’t understand why he was reacting so dramatically.

“Trying to get someone to learn painting is a sin worse than a thousand cuts! It’s a total sucker’s game!”

Ouyang said with a grave expression, rattling off the disadvantages of learning painting like pouring beans from a bamboo tube.

“First of all, learning painting requires talent. Having talent in this aspect is even harder than having superior bone structure for martial arts.”

“As for talent, that’s not something I need to worry about.”

Li Mo thought to himself that it couldn’t possibly be worse than his talent for the sword.

He could just pile on with Insights.

Besides, he didn’t intend to become some Grandmaster of Painting. He just needed to be able to draw the ‘Lower Form’ roughly. Everything else could be handled by the Creation Seal!

Ouyang twitched his mouth and couldn’t help but try to persuade him again.

“Learning to paint is also incredibly expensive.”

“When I first started learning painting, my family thought I had picked up some illegal or illicit habit.”

“It’s hilarious, really. Illegal habits aren’t nearly as expensive as high-quality brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones.”

Regarding this, Li Mo smiled shyly:

“I got a few sets of the Four Treasures of the Study. It should be enough for practice... right?”

He took out the brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones he had received as investment feedback.

“You’re using *these*... for practice?”

Ouyang’s jaw dropped.

Li Mo waved his hand. “They’d just be sitting there otherwise. Might as well use them.”

Ouyang: “...”

Listen to yourself. Is that even human language?

Jade paper of the Green Vein... Dustless Brush... Pine-patterned Purple Smoke Beast Ink... Qilin Fragrance Inkstone...

Even the greatest scholars of the present age couldn’t gather such a luxurious set.

Take that lump of beast ink, for example.

His master had waited over a decade at an auction to find a single piece, spending a small fortune to buy it.

He clenched his fists. At this moment, he really wanted to hit someone, but unfortunately, he wasn’t a match for him.

When he bid farewell to Li Mo, his expression was complicated.

“By the way, Junior Brother.”

“Hmm?”

“Next time you come to find me, just come straight in. Don’t shout that Elder Shang Wu is coming. It scared me so much I didn’t dare to paint today.”

“Got it.”

The young Li Mo politely presented a thousand taels of silver tickets, soothing Senior Brother Ouyang’s wounded soul.

“Take care, Senior Brother. If you have any questions about the Way of Painting, please come ask me anytime!”

Senior Brother Ouyang sent him down the mountain with a beaming smile.

***

Autumn Water Pavilion.

On the stone table lay a shattered statue and a ruined Divine Contemplation Diagram.

After returning, Li Mo tried to practice Divine Contemplation again.

Then...

The Night Ghost Statue and the Blood-Flesh Buddha Contemplation Diagram were both ruined.

He gritted his teeth and took out the Golden Crow Transforming the Sun Diagram.

The diagram was fine.

But he still didn’t gain any growth in his Soul Intent, let alone condense Form Intent or break open the Profound Core.

“Where exactly did things go wrong?”

“Is my accumulation at the Profound Core realm still insufficient?”

“Or is it... because of the Immortal Body?”

Li Mo couldn’t help but let his thoughts wander.

The former possibility was unlikely.

That left only the latter.

Even the Elders couldn’t understand the Immortal Body; he could only feel his way forward like a man crossing a river by feeling the stones.

“Now, I can only try slowly on my own.”

“If I can’t get a Divine Contemplation Diagram, I’ll have to make my own to have enough to eat.”

Li Mo took out the book *Wonderful Brush Produces Flowers: Ink Washing Record* and began to read it with full concentration.

Surprisingly, painting wasn’t a simple task at all.

Composition, form, and artistic conception needed to be perfectly combined.

To draw a Divine Contemplation Diagram, one even needed to condense one’s Soul Intent at the tip of the brush, outlining it with the flow of ink.

This undoubtedly raised the difficulty of painting geometrically.

If one was slightly careless, the painting would be ruined.

“I estimate my talent for painting is only slightly better than my talent for the sword...”

Li Mo shook his head.

After barely finishing the entire *Ink Washing Record*, he tried using his Martial Dao Insights.

【30 years of Martial Dao Insights injected successfully.】

***

Good news.

Martial Dao Insights could actually be used for this.

This was probably because the *Ink Washing Record* itself aimed to paint Divine Contemplation Diagrams and was categorized under the Martial Dao.

Bad news...

【30 years of Martial Dao Insights consumed.]

【Your *Wonderful Brush Produces Flowers: Ink Washing Record* has been comprehended to Initial Proficiency.]

Li Mo: “...”

In his mind flashed Senior Brother Ouyang’s expression of agonized persuasion, telling him not to learn painting.

“Trying to get someone to learn painting is a sin worse than a thousand cuts.”

This saying was absolutely correct!

Apparently, Initial Proficiency could only paint ordinary ink wash paintings. To paint a Divine Contemplation Diagram, one needed at least Great Accomplishment.

【30 years of Martial Dao Insights injected successfully.]

【Year 1: You recalled every scene you have seen in your life and practiced with all your might.]

...

【Year 30: You feel you have done everything possible with technique, yet you still cannot paint a Divine Contemplation Diagram. You feel this is probably the limit of what you can achieve on the Way of Painting.]

【Art requires talent. If you don’t have it, you don’t have it.]

【You haven’t even found what you want to paint, so how can you pour your spirit into it?]

【30 years of Martial Dao Insights consumed.]

Countless Insights poured into his mind.

“I’m just deducing the art of painting, why is it mocking me too!”

Young Li Mo punched the stone table, causing the Four Treasures of the Study to jump into the air.

Another thirty years thrown in, and he didn’t even reach Small Accomplishment!

Is there no justice? Is there no law!

“What’s wrong with you?”

A puzzled voice of the ‘Ice Cube’ sounded by his ear.

He looked up to see the少女 standing alone under the sunset, holding her sword, as if coated in a layer of fluorescence.

The evening wind was a bit boisterous.

It danced with the leaves, fluttered the少女’s skirt, and swayed her three thousand black strands of hair.

Li Mo was stunned.

He had just learned painting.

At this moment, he suddenly felt an urge to pick up a brush.

“Ice Cube.”

“Hmm?”

“Can you help me with something?”

“Anything but soaking in hot springs.”

“Hmm...”

***

Dinner.

Delicious food was laid out on the table.

Shang Wu looked curiously at the distance, where Li Mo was sitting seriously in front of an easel, wielding his brush vigorously, his strokes flowing like dragons and snakes.

“What is he doing?”

“He said he wants me to help him practice painting.”

Ying Bing withdrew her gaze, feeling a little strange in her heart.

Li Mo was really focused right now.

The feeling of being drawn seriously by someone had an indescribable nuance.

“Painting?”

“He went to Ruyi Peak and picked up *that* thing?”

Shang Wu’s almond eyes widened. She rolled up her sleeves and was about to rush to Ruyi Peak.

The beautiful Master was very angry.

This was trying to lead her precious disciple astray!

“Master, I want to learn it myself.”

Li Mo无奈ly spoke up.

“That makes it even worse!”

Shang Wu walked to his side.

She inadvertently glanced at the picture on the Jade paper of the Green Vein and her expression froze.

Instantly, she stopped making a fuss.

“Hmm?”

Ying Bing was a bit curious and stepped closer.

She saw a少女’s figure跃然纸上.

Her face wasn’t drawn.

But...

It was unmistakably her.
