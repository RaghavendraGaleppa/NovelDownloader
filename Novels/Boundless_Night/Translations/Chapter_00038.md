# Chapter 38: Sleepless Night

Qin Ming was truly startled. His fingertips were icy cold and actually began to permeate into his hand. How could he remain calm?

He immediately shook his hand forcefully, then tried to pull it off.

A day had passed, and the sunstone in the copper basin was no longer as bright, making the room quite dim. Even so, Qin Ming felt he should have noticed the mysterious substance sooner; he only realized its presence through the sensation on his hand.

He approached the copper basin, took out a sunstone, and examined it under the last lingering glow of the fiery light.

"A piece of ice melted?"

This cold liquid was colorless and odorless, easily overlooked. When Qin Ming crushed the stone, there was no unusual phenomenon.

"Could this be water that seeped into the stone after the rain, then froze and was nourished by the heavenly radiance, turning into a mysterious substance?" He was somewhat skeptical, as this chilling liquid truly had no unique characteristics.

The most precious treasure, a ten-colored pillar of light reaching the heavens, drew attention from all directions. It was destined to spread throughout many splendid cities, sparking heated discussions, and would undoubtedly be recorded in history.

"You're just a scrap of it. Besides being so cold it stings my hand, why do you have no other divine properties?" Qin Ming frowned as he examined it.

After he vigorously shook his hand, the liquid stopped permeating. Strangely, it didn't scatter onto the ground, yet it didn't feel particularly sticky either.

"What's it for?" Qin Ming pondered. This liquid had no special features, making him frown, as he had no idea how to use it. Should he let it seep into his flesh and blood? He felt it was too uncertain.

He had already learned from Mu Qing and Cao Long that the mysterious substances nourished by heavenly radiance came in many varieties, some of which were not only useless but even harmful to the body.

"Hmm?" Qin Ming's expression subtly changed. He had thought he'd expelled the cold sensation from his body earlier, and that shaking his hand vigorously prevented the liquid from entering his flesh and blood. But now it seemed that wasn't the case. An unusual feeling came from his right hand; the spot that had been permeated by the cold was now becoming warm.

Moreover, that warm current was spreading rapidly, or more precisely, flowing. It traveled along his fingers into his arm, then quickly moved from his shoulder to his neck.

Although it was comfortable, this unexpected situation made Qin Ming feel as if he was facing a formidable enemy. He immediately activated the Rebirth Method recorded in the silk scroll to resist.

But it was useless. On the contrary, that warm current began to "go to his head"!

Crucially, the portion of the icy liquid he hadn't managed to shake off also began to fully permeate his fingers, turning from cold to hot as it moved up his arm.

"I admit you're not stagnant water, you're quite special. Can we just stop for a moment? Let me catch my breath!" Facing this unknown and unpredictable situation, Qin Ming tried every method he knew, but nothing changed.

"All of it came in?" He shook his arms and rubbed his hands repeatedly. Broken golden ripples appeared on his body, but they were useless; instead, they accelerated the process.

The bone-chilling liquid rapidly transformed within his flesh and blood, giving off a warm sensation. Then, whether from his left or right hand, it all moved upward, like a hundred rivers converging into the sea, finally reaching his brow.

Qin Ming stared at himself in the mirror. Since he couldn't stop it, he could only calmly observe.

The warmth in the center of his forehead grew thicker and thicker until all the warm currents gathered there. His entire frontal bone began to glow, then the light spread deeper into his head.

He felt no discomfort. That rich warmth eventually dissipated.

Qin Ming carefully felt his body. Besides feeling exceptionally energetic, there seemed to be no other abnormalities.

He carried the long-handled black-gold hammer to the courtyard and practiced a set of saber techniques. His strength hadn't increased, and his physique showed no obvious changes.

But Qin Ming knew that this liquid couldn't be so simple. It was impossible for it to leave no trace in the end; the changes it caused must not yet have been discovered by him.

He looked up at the night sky, which seemed slightly clearer. The night fog seemed less dense, and his vision had improved a little, but it wasn't particularly significant.

Qin Ming ate some food and then went to the village entrance, standing by the fire spring beneath the black and white trees.

He ran his hand over the rough tree trunks. One large tree was black as ink, the other seemed carved from white jade, its leaves not falling even in the bitter winter.

"The liquid came from the Black and White Mountain. You two are seeds that drifted down from there…"

Clearly, Qin Ming was overthinking. Even when he held a black and a white leaf in his mouth, there was no abnormality.

"Let's leave it at that for now," he comforted himself. At least his body felt no discomfort; on the contrary, he felt energetic, so there shouldn't be any dreadful changes.

Suddenly, he sensed something. There was a commotion from Old Man Liu's house at the village entrance, accompanied by the cries of children and women.

Though only tens of meters away, Qin Ming entered the courtyard in a blink. His brows immediately furrowed as he saw three large ground chickens.

One of them was quite special: its feathers were light yellow and faintly glowing, its two legs were exceptionally thick, and its claws were unusually sharp, leaving slight scratches on the bluestone ground of the courtyard. It was much stronger than the other two ground chickens, likely the so-called second-mutation Golden Rooster.

In the courtyard was a grim-faced man, speaking in a low voice, but it was clear he was about to lose his temper. Qin Ming realized this was a Golden Rooster Knight from Golden Rooster Ridge. Why had he come to Old Man Liu's house?

Two other people accompanied him, also whispering to Old Man Liu. Old Man Liu's family stood by, at a loss, clearly frightened by these people.

With Qin Ming's hearing, he naturally heard everything clearly. They were persuasively, yet forcefully, trying to "purchase" the small red grass Old Man Liu had obtained from the Fire Bat Cave. In the shallow night, the Golden Rooster Ridge people had seen Old Man Liu emerge from the Fire Bat Cave and noticed a red light flash at his chest, realizing what was going on. Now they had come for it.

"Old Liu, you're already so old. You suffered severe injuries in your early years, and your foundation is long broken. It's difficult for you to achieve a second rebirth. Why not sell it at a high price and leave some assets for your children and grandchildren?"

"Yes, that kind of red grass, when consumed, feels like a raging fire. You're old and frail, you simply can't bear it. If your second rebirth fails, the consequences would be too terrible."

Old Man Liu was helpless, his face filled with an unspeakable desolation mixed with a hint of sorrow. He said, "I've strived my whole life, fought for most of my life, just for this one chance!"

Without a doubt, this was his obsession. And he had already prepared some cold-natured supplementary herbs. By slowly conditioning his body recently and consuming the red grass in portions, it wouldn't be a problem; he had a great chance of success.

Substances that could help people achieve rebirth were primarily because they contained abundant vitality and spirituality. The claims of "excessive medicinal potency" or "like a raging fire" were exaggerated.

...

Hearing this, Qin Ming felt infuriated. Wasn't this bullying? An old man over seventy, who had been longing for a second rebirth for decades, finally saw a glimmer of hope under this obsession, only for someone to come and forcibly buy it! He heard the price they offered. How was this different from outright robbery?

Dozens of Night Silver coins might indeed be a considerable fortune for ordinary people, but this was a spiritual substance that could help someone achieve a second rebirth. It was too insulting.

The small red grass grew in a dangerous cave guarded by a third-mutation creature, the Fire Bat. It was extremely difficult to harvest; even the Golden Rooster Knights themselves dared not enter.

"Three elder brothers…" Qin Ming spoke, stepping forward.

"Who are you? Stay out of this!" one person snapped, showing no mercy, clearly not wanting him to say anything more.

The Golden Rooster Knight merely swept his gaze over Qin Ming, his eyes cold. Though he said nothing, the warning was clear, telling him not to interfere.

"Little Qin, don't say anything. Let me go inside and think about it." Old Man Liu spoke, not wanting Qin Ming to get involved. Golden Rooster Ridge was too difficult to deal with; they were once a band of notorious bandits, and even though they had been pacified, their style of action remained crude. Once targeted by them, the consequences were unpredictable.

"Three elder brothers, this red grass Old Man Liu has was given by Cao Long and Mu Qing of Crimson Radiance City…" Qin Ming spoke again.

His implication was clear: he was mentioning the direct descendants of nobility from Crimson Radiance City, who now had a good relationship with Old Man Liu and were willing to give him spiritual substances to condition his body. Old Man Liu was even going to guide those people early tomorrow morning.

"Old Liu himself said these things, heh, but in the end, you're just…" The Golden Rooster Knight sneered. He didn't say Qin Ming was using their names to intimidate, but that was clearly the implication—he didn't believe people from Crimson Radiance City would deeply associate with a few hunters.

"Young man, you need to be sensible. Don't meddle in matters that aren't yours," the person next to him warned even more directly.

Old Man Liu turned and walked into the house, taking out a packet of gleaming red grass from a hidden compartment in the wall. Finally, with a resolute bite, he grabbed a handful and shoved it into his mouth. Instead of slowly conditioning his body with supplementary herbs, he ate most of it directly.

He only left a small amount, which he brought out to the courtyard.

"Just this little bit? Did you eat it beforehand?" The Golden Rooster Knight's face immediately darkened. His intuition was indeed very accurate.

"There really is only this much," Old Man Liu said.

"What good is this small amount? Old Liu, you're very good!" The Golden Rooster Knight patted his shoulder, then turned and left.

After the three disappeared into the village entrance, Old Man Liu opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood.

"Old Man Liu, what happened to you?" Qin Ming was startled.

Old Man Liu said, "That Golden Rooster Knight is very sinister. He practices the Yellow Earth Palm. He suspected I ate the spiritual substance in advance, and this was his way of secretly scattering my vital essence to prevent me from achieving a second rebirth."

Qin Ming looked through the courtyard gate into the wind and snow outside the village, really wanting to chase them and give each of them a hammer-saber blow. He knew he couldn't act so rashly. Golden Rooster Ridge had a group of notorious bandits behind them. Acting on a momentary impulse might bring great disaster to the entire village. He decided to "plan things out" after returning to the mountain.

"Old man, are you alright?"

"Grandpa!"

Old Man Liu's family anxiously gathered around him.

"How do you feel, sir?" Qin Ming asked.

Old Man Liu said, "I know Golden Rooster Ridge's style, so I was prepared. Although the situation isn't great, it's not too serious. A few days of recuperation will be enough."

In fact, Golden Rooster Ridge wasn't the only one who came to forcibly buy. People from the local Three-Eyed Cult also showed up, likewise led by Second Rebirthers. In the end, when the Three-Eyed Cult people realized they couldn't force a purchase, they too left with a flick of their sleeves, casting cold glances around before departing, making the encounter very unpleasant.

"It's not easy for ordinary people to live in such harsh conditions, and even after becoming Rebirthers, it's still difficult…" Qin Ming sighed in his courtyard that night.

Soon, he realized what change had occurred in him: his abundant vitality hadn't diminished at all. It was very late, yet he had no desire to sleep.

He lay there for a long time, only to find that he simply couldn't fall asleep. The more he closed his eyes, the more awake he became.

Restless in the middle of the night, what was going on? He wasn't an immortal; how could he not sleep? Besides, if there were immortals and gods in this world, they would have raised the sun long ago. Why would the night fog be dense and the world shrouded in darkness?

In the latter half of the night, Qin Ming had no choice but to get up and take a stroll. After walking around the village eighteen times, he felt even more energetic.

"What's wrong with me?" Returning to the courtyard, he practiced the Rebirth Method from the silk scroll, then practiced the combat techniques from the saber manual. He could feel tired, but he simply wasn't sleepy.

He went out late at night, eventually returning to the village entrance. Having nothing else to do, he cleared away the snow burying a stone tablet.

"I heard the elders say this tablet weighs 1,100 jin. I estimate I have a thousand jin of strength in one hand, but I've never actually tested it. I'll use it now."

Ultimately, Qin Ming managed to pull the stone tablet out of the frozen ground and then, astonishingly, lifted it above his head with a single hand.

"Although it's very strenuous, I can do it. This means my two arms actually have 2,200 jin of strength, which is higher than I estimated."

The next day, Xu Yueping saw Qin Ming and asked, "Little Qin, have you been crying?"

Qin Ming was startled. "No, why?"

"Why are your eyes a bit red?" Xu Yueping asked.

"I didn't sleep well last night," Qin Ming replied.

Old Man Liu went into the mountain as usual, showing no signs of injury.

Upon meeting Cao Long, Mu Qing, Wei Zhirou, and others, Qin Ming didn't hide anything and directly recounted how Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Cult had tried to forcibly buy the grass last night.

"That's a bit much," Mu Qing said.

Half an hour later, the Golden Rooster Knight from yesterday was found. Mu Qing slapped him, sending him flying six or seven meters away, losing many teeth.

"This is someone I invited, he's been helping me. You want to steal the spiritual grass we gave him?" Mu Qing asked coldly.

"No… it was a misunderstanding," the Golden Rooster Knight's voice trembled.

With a clang, Cao Long's great spear grazed past his ear. Changing direction, it sliced through a nearby large tree. Cao Long said coldly, "Even after we leave, none of you are allowed to retaliate, otherwise you will face grim consequences."

"I understand!"

Moments later, the people from the Three-Eyed Cult were also warned. However, Mu Qing and Wei Zhirou privately told Qin Ming and the others that while the Three-Eyed Cult's local stronghold wasn't significant, their distant orthodox sect was very powerful, with branches in many cities.

"Golden Rooster Ridge isn't simple either; it's a foothold established by the Golden Horde here."

Old Man Liu was very grateful for this; he hadn't expected them to stand up for him.

That day, Qin Ming found an opportunity to dig up the saber manual. Since Wang Nianfu had become a wanted criminal, he didn't have to worry too much and could take the secret scroll home to study.

After the shallow night ended, he returned to the village.

"I hope I can sleep tonight. I can't keep being this energetic!"

After dinner, he used the fiery glow of the sunstone to begin looking through the leather saber manual. The moment he opened it, he was stunned.

Qin Ming looked up at the outside, then lowered his head to look at the old ancient book. What was going on? This world felt different to him!
