# Deep Reflection on Reader Feedback (And a Plea for Follow-up Reads)

Dear fellow Daoists,

This novel initially performed exceptionally well in terms of data, even making it to the prestigious Sanjiang recommendation list. All of this was entirely due to your support for me and Han Yue. For this, I express my deepest gratitude.

However, after the story progressed to the sect portion, I began receiving numerous negative reviews from readers. The main criticisms focused on the content being too diluted, excessive exposition, slow pacing, and lack of plot progression.

Initially, I didn't quite understand these complaints. Personally, I very much enjoy reading cultivation segments and daily sect life in xianxia novels. Moreover, writing these sections actually requires more effort and time from me—I certainly never intended to pad the content.

Yet the actual results speak for themselves—all metrics have visibly declined!

After several days of deep reflection and multiple discussions with my editor, Blowing Snow, I've ultimately changed my perspective. I humbly accept all your opinions and suggestions.

The concentrated outpouring of sincere criticism clearly indicates that my writing simply wasn't engaging or enjoyable enough. I shouldn't have indulged in writing content I'm not skilled at and that readers don't enjoy, just for my own satisfaction.

I offer my sincere apologies here!

Moving forward, I'll do my utmost to write content that everyone enjoys. I also hope you'll continue providing feedback in the comments, so I can understand which parts still need improvement and avoid similar issues.

To address this problem, I've deleted 10,000 words of drafted content and have added extra updates today to accelerate the story's progression. I hope readers who've already left might see this message and consider giving me another chance.

Finally, I sincerely ask for your follow-up reads today.

Lastly, I'd like to sincerely recommend a new work by a talented author in our group: "After the Immortal's Fall."

And lastly of all, may all fellow Daoists find smooth paths in your cultivation and achieve immortality soon!
