# Chapter 189: The Dao Intent of Supreme Unity

"Is this the Dao Intent formed by merging thirty-six foundational Dao Intents? Why does it seem so... unremarkable?"

Zhang Jing's gaze swept rapidly over the unfamiliar Dao Intent before him as he unconsciously raised an eyebrow.

This was completely different from what he had anticipated.

He hadn't expected earth-shattering phenomena upon its emergence, but at least some manifestation should have appeared. After all, this contained fused elements of the Five Elements, Yin-Yang, Time-Space, and other powerful Dao Intents.

Although these Dao Intents only contained traces of their corresponding Great Dao principles, they still carried some essence.

In the next moment.

With a thought from Zhang Jing, the newly fused Dao Intent slowly returned to his body.

Instantly.

A vast, primordial, and supremely fundamental artistic conception suddenly permeated his mind, giving him a fleeting glimpse of the magnificent scene of heaven and earth's inception and the evolution of myriad Daos.

Yet this vision lasted only an instant before disappearing completely.

What is this...?

Zhang Jing's eyes flickered uncertainly.

The true meaning of the Primordial Beginning Realm's inheritance?

No! It more closely resembles the artistic conception of the Primordial Immortal Light of Creation.

But not quite.

Although this unfamiliar Dao Intent shared some similarities with the Primordial Immortal Light of Creation—both carrying a hint of the "One"—their essential natures felt entirely different to Zhang Jing.

He couldn't quite articulate their differences.

Perhaps...

The Primordial Immortal Light of Creation emphasized creation, while this unfamiliar Dao Intent leaned more towards existence, giving him a sense of being the origin of all things.

"Before heaven and earth were formed, there was chaotic simplicity, undifferentiated yet containing all things—this is called the Supreme Unity."

A phrase Zhang Jing had once read in his previous life suddenly flashed through his mind, seeming to perfectly describe this unfamiliar Dao Intent.

"Then let's just call it the Dao Intent of Supreme Unity," he thought to himself.

Soon after.

As if realizing something, a contemplative look appeared in Zhang Jing's eyes.

Supreme Unity (太一), also known as Supreme Yi (太乙).

Among the 365 foundational Dao Intents of the Supreme Yi Infinite Dao Sect—corresponding to the number of heavenly bodies—thirty-six of them could merge to form the Dao Intent of Supreme Unity.

And coincidentally...

These thirty-six Dao Intents were precisely those required for advancing to the Golden Core Divine Ability Realm through the World-Derivation path of the Primordial Beginning Realm inheritance.

Moreover...

If he remembered correctly, back at the lower realm's Dao Academy, the dean had once mentioned that the Pure Essence Breath Absorption Visualization Method was one of the most widely circulated foundational cultivation techniques among Dao Academies.

And the Pure Essence Breath Absorption Visualization Method seemed to have some intricate connection with the Primordial Beginning Realm inheritance.

Could all these really be coincidences?

Zhang Jing didn't believe that for a second.

"Perhaps the World-Derivation path of the Primordial Beginning Realm is more than just a lineage inheritance?"

......

Returning to reality.

Zhang Jing forcibly suppressed his doubts and turned his attention to the blazing Human Path True Flames around him.

The massive bronze arena beneath his feet was on the verge of collapse.

Opposite him.

Ji Changyu still wore the same confident expression as before, his brow radiating arrogance.

Noticing Zhang Jing's gaze, he smiled slightly and asked:

"Fellow Daoist, have you considered my proposal?"

"If we don't settle this quickly, the first place in this Proud Cloud Secret Realm might truly be taken by an outsider. Not to mention, this first place is related to the innate divine ability—Proud Sun Auspicious Clouds."

Seeing Zhang Jing remain unmoved, Ji Changyu pondered for a moment before adding:

"Very well, Fellow Daoist Zhang Jing. If you're willing to concede defeat, I'll give you all the fortune I've accumulated in this secret realm. How about that?"

Hearing this, Zhang Jing looked at the other man in surprise.

Giving away several billion units of fortune just like that? Truly befitting a prince of the Human Emperor Dao Court—his wealth was staggering.

However...

There was some truth to his words.

Not because Zhang Jing feared Chang Jin would reap the spoils of their conflict.

But simply because he felt this battle had indeed reached its conclusion.

Letting out a light sigh, a faint smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face as he said gently:

"Fellow Daoist Ji makes a valid point. There's no meaning in dragging this out further—it's time to end it."

As his words fell.

He extended a single finger.

Faint spiritual light of mana emerged.

The newly formed Dao Intent of Supreme Unity was summoned, coiling around his fingertip.

In an instant.

A speck of spiritual light streaked across the sky, heading straight for Ji Changyu.

A terrifying artistic conception—as if seeking to return all things under heaven to the chaotic state of Supreme Unity—spread along its path.

Wherever the spiritual light passed.

The previously indomitable Human Path True Flames, which had seemed capable of burning through anything, now appeared utterly powerless, dimming and extinguishing completely.

On the opposite side.

Upon hearing Zhang Jing's words, Ji Changyu's face had initially broken into an ecstatic smile, his lips nearly stretching to his ears.

"Haha, Fellow Daoist Zhang Jing truly has the greater good of our human race at heart. Rest assured, when we leave the secret realm, all the fortune will—"

His words cut off abruptly.

As if sensing something, Ji Changyu suddenly looked up, his pupils contracting as a chill shot up his spine from tailbone to crown.

In his field of vision.

A rapidly flickering speck of spiritual light grew larger and larger.

Within that light.

He smelled the thick scent of death.

In the blink of an eye.

The light had already reached his brow.

A white immortal light appeared in response.

"I shouldn't have been careless. If I'd kept my full attention on Zhang Jing, or gone all out from the start, I'd still be standing on this arena!"

Ji Changyu thought with regret.

His figure instantly vanished from the spot.

The next moment.

Boom—!

With a deafening explosion that shook the heavens.

The spiritual light imbued with the Dao Intent of Supreme Unity continued unimpeded, striking the bronze arena behind where Ji Changyu had stood.

Crack! Crack!

An unending series of shattering sounds erupted.

The thousand-zhang bronze arena, already riddled with holes, finally gave way, splitting into two massive pieces.

Like a small portion of the sky collapsing, the enormous shadow slowly fell.

In this moment.

All sound ceased.

Zhang Jing stood calmly in mid-air, his serene gaze sweeping over the falling arena before turning upward to the sky.

[Rank A-1: Chang Jin, Wins: 97]
[Rank B-1: Zhang Jing, Wins: 97]
[Rank C-1: Ji Changyu, Wins: 96]
[Rank A-2: Qu Junhou, Wins: 95]
......
......

Before long.

Zhang Jing withdrew his gaze.

"Only two battles remain—one against Brother Qu Junhou, and one against Chang Jin. Given the secret realm spirit's patterns, my match against Chang Jin will likely be... the final one!"

As if thinking of something amusing, a faint smile flashed in the corners of his eyes.

......

At this moment.

On the arenas and various locations across the Island of Talents.

Countless gazes—some disbelieving, others awed—settled upon Zhang Jing.

"How is this possible!"
"Ji Changyu clearly seemed stronger! That golden-red flame divine ability was unstoppable."
"Hmph! Ridiculous! How can you judge strength by appearances?"
"Though we're all at the Foundation Establishment realm, can the strength of those three really be assessed with mere eyes? Even the secret realm spirit had to set up these arenas for evaluation."
"Exactly."
"Don't forget, Fellow Daoist Zhang Jing used thirty-six perfected Dao Intents in this battle! With such terrifying innate talent, his victory isn't surprising."
"Terrifying indeed!"

......

In one corner of the Island of Talents.

"Elder Brother... are you alright?"

Ji Jiulin asked cautiously, looking at the slightly disheveled Ji Changyu before him.

As he spoke.

His gaze inadvertently drifted to Zhang Jing in the sky.

A trace of awe flashed through his eyes.

His elder brother, who had forged the Blazing Mortal World Dao Foundation and ignited the Primordial Flame, had actually lost to another Foundation Establishment cultivator!

And if not for the secret realm spirit's protection, just now...

Ji Jiulin shook his head.

For a moment, he felt as if he were living in an unreal dream.

Just then.

"I'm fine!"

Ji Changyu slowly stood up, his eyes filled with unwillingness as he said:

"This time, I was careless. I didn't guard against Zhang Jing's sneak attack. Otherwise, I would have been the last one standing on that arena!"

Having said that.

A thoughtful expression appeared on his face as he analyzed:

"But... losing this battle doesn't necessarily mean I've lost all chance at first place and the Proud Sun Auspicious Clouds divine ability. There's still hope!"

"As long as I defeat Chang Jin next, and Chang Jin defeats Zhang Jing, then it's a tie between us all."

Behind him.

Hearing these words.

An odd look crossed Ji Jiulin's face.

He wanted to say something, but the words died on his lips.

Given his elder brother's current state.

Perhaps it was better to keep his thoughts to himself.

......

"Master, we entered the Dao Sect at nearly the same time, and I've had your guidance. Why is the gap between me and Brother Zhang so vast?"

"And it seems to be growing wider."

"Can a person's innate talent truly reach such heights?"

Qu Junhou's voice, tinged with frustration and despair, suddenly echoed in his sea of consciousness.

The scene of Zhang Jing defeating Ji Changyu replayed endlessly in his mind.

His expression had become indescribably complex.

For a moment.

He didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Logically.

He should be happy for Brother Zhang's victory.

Yet every time he recalled how utterly powerless he'd been against Ji Changyu.

He simply couldn't bring himself to smile.

"Disciple, during the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core realms—where innate talent matters most—don't compare yourself to that little monster. Trying to do so will only bring you humiliation. His talent far surpasses your imagination."

Within Qu Junhou's sea of consciousness.

The faint figure of an elderly man materialized, speaking quietly.

"But once you reach the Dharma Idol realm and beyond, many more factors influence strength—innate talent, opportunities, and fortune all play crucial roles. That will be your chance to catch up to him, even surpass him."

"I know of several great opportunity sites. After you advance to the Golden Core realm, you can attempt to visit one and undergo a transformation there."

"Thank you, Master!"

Qu Junhou said gratefully.

"Don't worry, my disciple. As my student, you'll never be inferior to anyone. These small skirmishes mean nothing. Your true goal is to attain the Dao Fruit of the Carefree Heavenly Immortal, even the Dao Fruit of the Eternal Golden Immortal."

"Junhou understands. Thank you for your guidance, Master!"

After listening to his master's words.

A spark of excitement flashed in Qu Junhou's eyes.

The frustration and despair that had weighed on his heart earlier.

Had now completely vanished.

......

As time passed.

As if sensing something.

In mid-air.

Zhang Jing, who had been resting with his eyes closed, suddenly opened them and looked straight at an arena not far away.

Two numbers slowly appeared.

B-1! A-2!

"A-2—Brother Qu! Just as I expected."

Zhang Jing smiled slightly.

Then his gaze shifted to the adjacent arena.

A-1! C-1!
