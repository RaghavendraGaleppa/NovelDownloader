# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 136: Returning to the Mountain and Alchemy  

"Treating each other as peers?"  

Lin Xuan was overjoyed. The path of cultivation was fraught with difficulties, and having the guidance of a high-level cultivator would bring immense benefits. However, he maintained a respectful expression and replied humbly, "Senior, you flatter me. How could this junior possibly..."  

"Enough with the formalities. I, Ouyang Qinxin, dislike hypocrites. You have done me a great favor, and I also value your status as the young master of the Spirit Medicine Mountain. Whether you wish to befriend me or not, the choice is yours."  

What a straightforward woman! Lin Xuan inwardly praised her. He immediately dropped his pretenses and said earnestly, "Since Senior does not disdain me, then I... shall respectfully comply."  

Hearing this, Ouyang Qinxin's expression softened. Her willingness to lower herself to befriend Lin Xuan stemmed from two reasons: first, she genuinely appreciated his timely warning and rescue; second, the Spirit Medicine Mountain held significant weight in the cultivation world. Despite her exceptional talent, advancing beyond the Core Formation stage was extremely challenging, and she often required rare elixirs to aid her cultivation. Befriending Lin Xuan would undoubtedly be beneficial for her.  

Glancing at the storage pouch in Lin Xuan's hand, she pondered for a moment before saying, "I didn't bring any treasures with me on this trip, so I'll offer you this instead—the storage pouch of that dwarf Miao. Consider it a token of our friendship."  

Lin Xuan was delighted. Although Ouyang Qinxin had taken the dragon-shaped magical artifact, the remaining treasures in the storage pouch still belonged to a Core Formation cultivator. The contents were bound to be substantial.  

"Thank you, Senior!"  

"No need for thanks."  

Lin Xuan smiled but said nothing. Another cultivator might not have been so generous, as Ouyang Qinxin had been the one to defeat Miao the Dwarf.  

In the ruthless world of cultivation, betrayal was not uncommon. Fortunately, Ouyang Qinxin was not that kind of person.  

With a flick of her jade-like hand, she produced a jade slip and handed it to Lin Xuan. "This contains some of my cultivation insights over the years. It should be helpful to you."  

"Thank you."  

Lin Xuan accepted the jade slip with great joy. Cultivation insights were invaluable, as they could save one from many detours. Most cultivators guarded their knowledge jealously, often withholding even from their disciples. It seemed Ouyang Qinxin was sincere in befriending him.  

With a smile, Lin Xuan said, "Senior's kindness is deeply appreciated. Though my cultivation is still weak and I cannot offer much now, if you ever need any elixirs refined in the future, feel free to visit me at the Spirit Medicine Mountain."  

"Mm." Ouyang Qinxin nodded and took out a small jade-carved guqin from her sleeve. "If you ever encounter any difficulties, you may seek me out at the Green Cloud Mountain."  

After exchanging a few more pleasantries, they prepared to part ways. Lin Xuan hesitated for a moment before saying, "Senior, please be cautious of Taibai Sword Immortal when you return to the mountain."  

Ouyang Qinxin turned sharply, her expression grave. "Have you heard something?"  

"No," Lin Xuan shook his head. "It's just that I find Taibai Sword Immortal somewhat... Well, please be careful."  

Hearing his ambiguous words, Ouyang Qinxin was momentarily taken aback before her expression softened. She gave him a meaningful look and smiled. "Thank you for the warning. I will be cautious. Farewell." With that, she transformed into a streak of blue light and vanished into the horizon.  

Watching her disappear, Lin Xuan stood silently for a while, reflecting on his actions. He believed he had handled the situation appropriately.  

Having forged a friendship with Ouyang Qinxin, he naturally did not want anything to happen to her. The support of a Core Formation cultivator would be invaluable for his future cultivation.  

Initially, Lin Xuan had considered revealing Taibai Sword Immortal's conspiracy to her. However, upon further thought, he realized that Ouyang Qinxin and Zhang Taibai were both from the Green Cloud Mountain sect, whereas he had only known her for a few hours. Speaking too deeply too soon was unwise.  

Lin Xuan had no intention of doing something thankless. Thus, he had merely hinted that Zhang Taibai might pose a threat, leaving the specifics for Ouyang Qinxin to deduce.  

A single word was enough for the wise. With his warning, Ouyang Qinxin would surely be more vigilant, achieving his goal.  

With that, Lin Xuan transformed into a streak of light and disappeared into the vast wilderness.  

He did not stop along the way, flying straight back to the Spirit Medicine Mountain. He did not want to encounter any more misfortunes.  

The journey took a full day and night.  

When the gates of the Spirit Medicine Mountain came into view, Lin Xuan finally relaxed, feeling a sense of familiarity and comfort. The trials of his journey had left him exhausted.  

Returning to his cave dwelling, he bathed and slept soundly. The next morning, he awoke to find a message talisman floating in the air before his bed.  

Lin Xuan was momentarily surprised before realization dawned. He reached out, and the talisman flew into his palm. The voice of Tongyu Zhenren emerged: "My dear disciple, you've returned. Come to my cave at once."  

"Dear disciple?"  

Lin Xuan nearly laughed. He had not expected his usually stern master to display such humor.  

Yet, within those few words, he sensed genuine concern, warming his heart. Regardless of the circumstances, his master had always treated him well.  

After freshening up, Lin Xuan made his way to Tongyu Zhenren's cave.  

Having learned of the Spirit Medicine Mountain's hidden strength, Lin Xuan now regarded his master—who was always engrossed in alchemy—in a new light. A question arose in his mind: was Tongyu Zhenren truly a Foundation Establishment cultivator? Or was he concealing his true power, playing the fool?  

However, it was not yet time to ask. Until he understood the true reason behind his master's decision to appoint him as the next sect leader, Lin Xuan resolved to feign ignorance.  

The cultivation world was brutal, and conflicts between masters and disciples were not unheard of. Though Tongyu Zhenren had treated him well so far, caution was Lin Xuan's guiding principle.  

To his surprise, Tongyu Zhenren only inquired about his experience at the "Nascent Soul Assembly" and expressed some concern for his well-being. Lin Xuan naturally omitted the details of stealing the Seven-Star Grass and his encounter with Ouyang Qinxin, but he truthfully recounted the rest.  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan bid his master farewell. The scene was one of a dutiful disciple and a caring master, though only they knew their true thoughts.  

Returning to his cave, Lin Xuan pondered for a moment. At the very least, Tongyu Zhenren seemed to harbor no ill intentions toward him—for now. Setting the matter aside, he focused on his immediate priority: improving his strength.  

He headed to the alchemy chamber.  

From his storage pouch, he retrieved a wooden box. Opening it, he revealed a vibrant green herb.  

Though unassuming in appearance, this was the legendary Seven-Star Grass. Obtaining it had been a perilous endeavor, but his efforts had borne fruit.  

Next, he took out a large quantity of common herbs from another storage pouch—materials he had purchased from the grand market.  

Now, it was time to refine the Meridian-Cleansing Pills.  

These pills did not enhance cultivation directly, but they allowed him to bypass the daily limit of three Foundation Establishment Pills, significantly accelerating his progress.  

With the backing of the Blue Star Sea, Lin Xuan was not overly concerned about failure. Even if the refining process went awry, he could always purify the results.  

...  

Several days later.  

Lifting the cauldron lid, Lin Xuan's face lit up with joy. Perhaps because the Meridian-Cleansing Pills were relatively simple to refine, this batch had succeeded.  

He examined a purple pill before storing it in a prepared vial.  

In the following months, Lin Xuan continued refining the pills.  

By the end, the alchemy chamber was filled with dozens of small vials, each containing finished pills.  

Half of these were successfully refined, while the other half were purified from failed attempts.  

Regardless, Lin Xuan now possessed thousands of Meridian-Cleansing Pills.  

He held up the remaining Seven-Star Grass. Despite refining so many pills, less than a fifth of the herb had been used.  

After a moment's thought, he returned it to the wooden box and applied a preservation technique, ensuring it would remain viable for decades.  

With a sweep of his sleeve, he stored the pills and left the alchemy chamber.  

Lin Xuan began his cultivation in earnest.  

With the Meridian-Cleansing Pills neutralizing the effects, he could now consume up to fifteen Foundation Establishment Pills daily. Despite his poor innate talent, the sheer quantity of pills allowed his cultivation to progress at an astonishing rate.  

Of course, he did not spend all his time in seclusion. Between cultivation sessions, Lin Xuan studied alchemy texts and gradually took on more responsibilities within the Spirit Medicine Mountain, as befitting his status as the future sect leader.  

Thus, day after day, five years passed in the blink of an eye.
