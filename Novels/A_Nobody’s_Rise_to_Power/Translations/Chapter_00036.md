Chapter 36: Descending the Mountain

Qiaoshe hurried forward with a smile to smooth things over. "Manager Yang, since that's the case, let our Qingmei go with you. Our Qingmei is very quick-witted. She calculates accounts even faster than the old head accountant, and her ability to read people is exceptional. With Qingmei accompanying you, if you encounter a difficult tenant or a slippery steward, she can help you out, right?"

Suo Chanzhi glanced at her indifferently, a faint, mocking smile on her lips. "Qiaoshe, you're not very old, but you certainly know how to handle things. You've arranged everything inside and out, up and down, so clearly and thoroughly. It seems my manor really can't do without someone like you."

Qiaoshe's face paled. She quickly bowed, stammering, "Young Mistress, I was just... just trying to put in a good word for Qingmei, and also... to please you..."

Suo Chanzhi let out a soft laugh. "So, that means I don't know what's good for me."

"No, no, oh..." In her panic, Qiaoshe lightly slapped her own cheek to apologize. "This servant knows her mistake. I beg the Young Mistress for forgiveness."

Suo Chanzhi's voice was cold. "Qiaoshe, you have overstepped your bounds!"

Qingmei said, "The Young Mistress just established the rules for the manor the day before yesterday. How should a mistake like yours be handled?"

Qiaoshe stammered, "T-twenty slaps to the face."

"Hmm." Suo Chanzhi's voice remained soft and gentle, carrying a hint of allure amidst its coolness, but the words she spoke were chilling to the bone. "Remember, by my side, there is no place for those who do not understand the rules."

Qiaoshe knelt, trembling. "Yes, this servant knows her mistake."

Suo Chanzhi flicked her sleeve. "Kneel in the courtyard and give yourself twenty slaps. Qingmei, you will supervise the punishment."

Qiaoshe dared not disobey and quickly retreated to the courtyard, kneeling in the sunlight. As a personal attendant to the Young Mistress, she held a relatively high status in the inner residence. But now, she could only kneel there, in front of all the maids and matrons coming and going, slapping her own face without holding back in the slightest.

Qingmei followed her out to supervise. For a moment, only Yang Can and Suo Chanzhi remained in the room. Although the door was still open, they spoke in low voices, not worried about being overheard.

Suo Chanzhi asked in a low voice, "Why do you need to tour the estates?"

Yang Can replied, "I have to go eventually, and it can't be put off until autumn. If that's the case, going sooner is better than later. And besides..." Yang Can paused, then continued, "The outer estate is relatively stable, and it's difficult to get a foothold there. Especially with a Senior Manager above me. If I can gain control of a few farmlands and pastures, I'll have some external leverage."

Suo Chanzhi nodded. "Let Qingmei go with you. If she goes, I'll have an excuse to send Suo family guards to help you. Moreover, with Qingmei there, if you have any urgent matters, you can contact me through her. Qingmei is my trusted aide; I will instruct her."

"Alright, I'll go back and make some preparations. I'll be descending the mountain in a few days."

Suo Chanzhi nodded. Her slender hand slapped the table with a 'crack'. She raised her voice and said sharply, "I said Qingmei is to go, so she will go! Manager Yang, there is no need for further discussion!"

"This minister takes his leave!" Yang Can's voice was also quite loud, carrying an undercurrent of indignation. He flicked his sleeve and stormed out of the main hall.

In the courtyard outside the hall, Qiaoshe was kneeling bolt upright, fiercely slapping her own face. Qingmei stood beneath the eaves, her small, sweet face slightly raised. Not far away, under the covered corridor, several maids and matrons were hiding and whispering. They had not only witnessed Qiaoshe's punishment but also heard the explosive conversation between the Young Mistress and Yang Can.

Yang Can stopped at the top of the steps. Qingmei's bright eyes darted towards him, a triumphant smile on her face. "Manager Yang, no matter how unwilling you are, you and I will be traveling together."

Yang Can snorted and brushed past her, descending the stone steps.

Qiaoshe hadn't held back in the slightest. If a matron from the Suo family had been carrying out the family punishment, she would have suffered even more. Her delicate, pretty face was now a bruised purple-red, and the corner of her mouth was bleeding. Yang Can sighed and suddenly tossed a small medicinal gourd from his sleeve. It landed on Qiaoshe's skirt, which was spread out like a lotus leaf.

"You are the Young Mistress's personal attendant. Your face is the curtain to your master's door. What would it look like if it were disfigured? This medicine is excellent for reducing swelling and stopping bleeding. After you finish the family punishment, remember to apply it to your face."

Qiaoshe looked at Yang Can gratefully. Manager Yang was clearly protecting her. After all, she and Manager Yang were from the Yu family; they were on the same side. Those Suo family people were all scoundrels!

Yang Can then glanced sideways at Qingmei and said in a sarcastic tone, "These days, the one supervising the punishment looks more like the clown on stage than the one being punished. Isn't that strange?"

With that, Yang Can strode away.

This intense confrontation with Suo Chanzhi and her servant would surely reach the ears of those with ulterior motives, further cementing the impression that he was at odds with the Suo family.

"You...姓...杨的!" (You... surname... Yang!) Qingmei stomped her foot angrily at Yang Can's retreating back. This bastard, now that he doesn't have the chance to bully my mistress, he's getting addicted to bullying me? Although little Qingmei knew Yang Can was putting on an act, she couldn't help but feel angry.

Li Youcai descended the mountain, taking eight attendants with him. Since this trip would take at least two to three months, all the stewards of the main branch came to see him off. Yang Can, as the second manager, stood at the front with Madam Pan (Xiaowan).

"Salt and iron are nearly as important to the Yu family as agriculture. Although I am reluctant to part with you, with the young master having just passed away, I cannot neglect my duty to inspect the affairs, to reassure everyone."

"For the sake of fulfilling your duty to the clan head and the main branch, how could I dare to let personal feelings interfere?" Pan Xiaowan looked reluctant to part. "I will manage the household well, my husband, you can rest assured."

Li Youcai smiled and nodded. He then looked at Yang Can. "Manager Yang, agriculture is the foundation of our Yu clan. You must put in great effort and not let the clan head and the Young Mistress down."

Yang Can replied, "Rest assured, Senior Manager. I, Yang, will also be descending the mountain in a few days to tour the various farmlands. When the time comes, I will certainly follow your instructions and handle matters properly."

Li Youcai understood and smiled. He patted Yang Can's arm, then exchanged a few pleasantries with the other stewards before mounting his horse. Holding his whip, he cupped his fists to them and said, "Everyone, please return. I am off!"

Li Youcai rode down the mountain with his eight attendants. They rounded several bends and crossed two ridges, arriving at Phoenix Mountain Pass. There was an orchard here that supplied fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry to Phoenix Mountain Manor. The orchard steward was one of Li Youcai's trusted men. He was already waiting here, and behind him was a carriage.

The moment Li Youcai saw the carriage, his heart bloomed with joy. He immediately dismounted, merely waving a hand at the orchard steward before eagerly getting into the carriage.

With a 'swish', the carriage curtain was lifted, and Li Youcai saw a young maid in green sitting inside. It was a small bed-sized couch, but she was huddled in a corner. When the curtain was lifted, light poured in, and the girl's body shrank back, like a startled sparrow.

Li Youcai squinted to look at her. She was in her tender teens, with a slender waist that seemed as if it couldn't be grasped in one hand. Her jet-black hair was tied with a red cord, revealing a slender, milky-white neck. Especially her eyes, they were clear, black pools, filled with panicked tears.

Li Youcai immediately showed a satisfied expression. This Zhang Yunyi, the head of Feng'an Estate, truly knew how to be a person. The little maid he had chosen was truly a delight. In fact, Zhang Yunyi had delivered this little maid to him a couple of days ago, but Li Youcai hadn't let him bring her up the mountain, instead having her placed here. The Senior Manager wanted to take the little maid with him on his tour, to warm his bed and serve him on the journey. By the time he returned to the mountain, the rice would already be cooked, and even if his wife was unwilling, there would be nothing she could do.

"Hurry, let's go! Hurry!" Li Youcai gave an impatient command and plunged into the carriage.

This mountain path was the main route between Phoenix Mountain Manor and the outside world, so it was naturally often maintained. However, when the carriage passed over it, it was still unavoidable for it to be a bit bumpy. Some sections or at certain times, the carriage would be particularly jumpy. Just like now...

Fortunately, this intense jolting didn't last long. In ancient times, when an army charged, the general would beat a rapid drum as a signal, and the rapid drum had to be beaten three times. It took about two minutes to beat the three rounds of the drum. Today, Senior Manager Li fully demonstrated what "one surge of energy, then it wanes, and by the third, it is exhausted" means. Of that rapid drum, he only managed about one and a half rounds before the carriage was moving smoothly and steadily...

Watching Senior Manager Li descend the mountain, the group of stewards followed Yang Can and Madam Pan back to the manor. As they reached the gate of Senior Manager Li's small courtyard, Pan Xiaowan suddenly stopped and said to Yang Can with a smile, "Manager Yang, the Senior Manager has a fine wine to give you. Please come with me to get it."

"Uh, thank you for the trouble, Madam." All the stewards were there, and Madam Pan looked completely serious, so Yang Can couldn't refuse. Otherwise, the stewards would surely become suspicious.

The two entered the courtyard. Madam Pan still looked dignified, but suddenly let out a soft, charming laugh and whispered, "What, you don't dare enter my house? Is it some dragon's lair or tiger's den?"

Yang Can gave a wry smile. This woman was just short of beating gongs and drums to announce to the world, "This old lady wants to seduce you." How could he not understand Madam Pan's intentions?

In fact, after confirming that Suo Chanzhi was pregnant, he had to use the main branch as his foundation to begin his struggle. And for the outer estate of the main branch, even with Suo Chanzhi's status as the Young Mistress of the main branch, it would be very difficult for her to purge it, let alone Yang Can, who was an airdropped second manager.

Pan Xiaowan was Li Youcai's wife, and Senior Manager Li was henpecked. If Yang Can could turn Madam Pan into his own person, it would obviously be of great benefit to him. Moreover, Li Youcai had clearly shown his intention to ruin him, so Yang Can didn't need to have any psychological burden toward Senior Manager Li.

However, he didn't want to provoke this enchantress, because he had an instinctive feeling that this woman was uncontrollable. He was worried that if he took in this enchantress, it wouldn't be a stroke of fortune, but a calamity. The raft you think will take you across the river could also be the coffin that buries you in the waves.

"Lai Xi, Lai Xi." At Madam Pan's call, Lai Xi ran out from a side room.

Pan Xiaowan said, "I just had the kitchen simmer a double-boiled bird's nest with rock sugar. It needs to be cooked over a gentle fire. The people in the kitchen aren't very attentive. You go and watch over it. It needs to be simmered for a full hour and a half before it's ready to be taken out."

"Alright!" Lai Xi agreed and ran off happily. He could always snag some tasty snacks while in the kitchen; this was a task he enjoyed.

Pan Xiaowan ushered Yang Can into the main hall, her seductive eyes fixed on him as she used her back to push the door shut slowly.

"Please have a seat, Uncle. I'll go get the wine." Pan Xiaowan gave Yang Can an alluring glance and then sauntered towards the inner room.
