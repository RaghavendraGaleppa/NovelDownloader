**Chapter 245: Old and Young Have Gone Mad [Two Chapters in One]**

In the night sky, thick clouds exploded.

Cao Qianqiu was horrified; his power reached the realm of creation, so why was he plummeting from the sky? A momentary lapse in concentration brought him a "storm," followed by "a thousand hammers and a hundred refinements." Who were these people around him? All were Ancestors, their cultivation unfathomably deep, their combat experience extraordinarily rich.

"Boom!"

The Tathagata of This Era spoke little, but his strikes were anything but subtle. His entire body radiated boundless light, shattering the night fog and cracking the earth. He pressed his right hand downwards, and heavenly light materialized into a colossal palm descending from the sky. This was the famous Tathagata's Giant Hand, carrying endless runes, appearing to burn as it struck Cao Qianqiu, causing his body to crack open and Pure Yang blood to stain him. The immense impact even dislodged one of Old Cao's eyeballs.

The Yuqing Ancestor pointed his right hand, and the heavenly light transformed into a Measuring Heaven Ruler, as pristine as jade. As it descended, it was like a meteor piercing the night sky, radiating boundless terror. With a crash, Cao Qianqiu's body-protecting golden light shattered, and a piece of his head crumbled.

"Ah..." he roared, the clouds on the plateau completely dispersing. When had he ever faced such a perilous situation? He was surrounded and overwhelmed, filling him with intense resentment.

Simultaneously, black and white light swirled, binding him. Jiang Zhiyuan, the Temple Master of the Yin-Yang Temple, attacked, using the black and white energy to tear apart his Immortal Dao golden body.

*Slap!*

At this moment, Qingtian Ancestor arrived, his black hair disheveled, a grin on his face. He slapped Cao Qianqiu's head, the sound echoing like thunder across the sky. Cao Qianqiu was completely stunned. Never in his life had he suffered such humiliation! What had he just experienced? After being entangled by the black and white light, that old monster Qingtian seized the opportunity to slap the left side of his head, leaving his ears ringing. This was a colossal disgrace!

"Old mutt!" Cao Qianqiu was consumed by rage, his white hair flying wildly, seemingly capable of slicing through the void. He knew that Qingtian had originally intended to slap his left cheek but he had narrowly avoided it, resulting in the blow landing near his left ear. Clearly, Qingtian had a better attack point, but he just wanted to hit him like that. The actual damage wasn't significant, but the mental blow was too intense!

For a moment, Old Cao nearly self-destructed on the spot, so enraged that immortal flames spewed from his seven orifices. His entire body was enveloped in a red blaze, his fury overflowing. Immediately after, he felt excruciating pain.

Lu Yu manipulated the Six Qi, splitting them into Six Emperors that were indistinguishable from true Immortals. They wore golden pearl crowns with beaded fringes and held jade tablets, with seals hovering at their sides. The six figures ignored space, teleporting to Cao Qianqiu, each grabbing a limb, his head, and so on, intending to tear him apart. Old Cao had been powerful and formidable his entire life, but now he was constantly on the defensive. His opponents were practically dismembering him. His body-protecting immortal light transformed into layers of symbols, like twinkling stars, and his Pure Yang power boiled, resisting the Six Emperors' force of the Ancestors.

At the same time, the other Ancestors struck again. Who were these people? All were paramount figures standing atop the clouds of the night fog world, their cultivation as profound as the deep sea. They were individuals who had fought their way out of mountains of corpses and seas of blood, their grasp of battle far beyond ordinary comprehension.

"Ah..." Cao Qianqiu's arm was torn off.

Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan, radiating ten thousand streams of immortal light and a thousand auspicious rays, erupted with their full power to provide rescue. They couldn't allow Old Cao to be besieged and blown apart. This concerned the prestige of their Immortal Path. Moreover, if anything happened to Cao Qianqiu, the repercussions would be far-reaching, creating an uncontrollable storm. Even Yu Shaohua couldn't "coast" too much; after all, she was part of the Immortal Path faction. As she stepped forward, immortal lotuses bloomed one after another beneath her feet, and she instantly appeared at the center of the battlefield. Ten suns hung in the sky, turning the long night into day. Even from outside the plateau, everything beneath the sky could be seen.

Everyone was shocked, on the verge of turning to stone. That was Cao Qianqiu, boundlessly domineering, known as "Cao the Unconquerable," yet today he was suffering a calamity, and not a very dignified one. This was unbelievable! In all the past rumors, he was the one fiercely killing renowned figures from other paths, shattering one iron plate after another, earning a formidable reputation. In the past, it was almost true to say he wielded absolute power. Today, he himself was suffering a brutal assault; everything had been reversed. The brutality with which Cao Qianqiu had beaten others in the past was matched by the ferocity with which the Ancestors struck him today. This was only the beginning. Those few Ancestors sometimes preferred to endure attacks from Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan, intent on crippling Cao Qianqiu.

Some venerable figures on the Immortal Path side felt unsettled, sensing that something terrible was about to happen. Today, even if Cao Qianqiu didn't die, he would be flayed and have some bones removed. If not for Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan's explosive efforts, rescuing him with all their might, and Yu Shaohua's arrival, Old Cao, struck by five Ancestors, would have been truly miserable. Even so, his shoulder was torn, one foot even snapped off, and his eyeball was shattered. This was an unprecedentedly dangerous situation. However, he finally managed to catch his breath. And he was no longer falling.

Cao Qianqiu frowned. What kind of status did he possess? How could his body suddenly lose control? Had he not yet escaped the influence of Black and White Mountain? At the last moment, he temporarily threw away his spear!

"Haven't moved my muscles and bones in many years, they've rusted. A small warm-up, much more comfortable now," Qingtian grinned. He was tall and burly, his eyes more terrifying than lightning, beams of light tearing through the clouds with every blink. Cao Qianqiu's chest heaved. He truly wanted to grab this old coot, punch through his mouth, and explode him with full force.

"Little brat, I see you're still not convinced. Come on then, I'll cripple you!" Qingtian said. The other Ancestors didn't speak, but having the crude, ferocious, and down-to-earth Qingtian Ancestor as their spokesman was enough.

Cao Qianqiu's eyes were as cold as from hell. How had he ever endured such humiliation in his life? "Old Sun, Wenhan, Immortal Yu, the three of you hold back their respective opponents for me. I want to fight this old mutt with all my might!" he said chillingly.

"Do you really intend to fight this to the end?" Sun Taichu's voice also turned cold, looking at the Ancestors of the New Path.

"Less nonsense!" Lu Yu's only response was three words. The Ancestors on the Immortal Path side couldn't help but ponder: had Lu Yu, Qingtian, the Tathagata of This Era, and the others decayed and were making a final desperate stand, or were they on the rise again, recovering and approaching their peak? How many major battles could the New Path Ancestors sustain? Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan's greatest worry was that these few had completely succeeded in their Nirvana.

For now, only Cao Qianqiu's eyes were bloodshot, eager for immediate revenge! At this moment, the Immortal Path and New Path were in a four-on-five state. Cao Qianqiu believed that the New Path Ancestors were all old and frail, and wouldn't last much longer. Eventually, they would turn the tide of battle and achieve a decisive kill!

"What are you looking at?!" Qingtian Ancestor attacked, seemingly teleporting through space to appear directly in front. Without another word, his large hand, capable of shattering mountains, slapped directly at Old Cao's face.

"I..." Cao Qianqiu was filled with indignation, feeling truly bullied. In fact, Qingtian's ferocity and dominance were precisely the demeanor Old Cao usually displayed when looking down on other opponents.

"Hitting you makes me feel so good!" At this moment, even the most taciturn Tathagata of This Era uttered such a remark.

"Agreed!" Jiang Zhiyuan of the Yin-Yang Temple nodded. Cao Qianqiu's entire being was unwell.

The great battle erupted once more!

***

Outside the plateau, people watched as the five Ancestors attacked Cao Qianqiu, their hearts surging. Many wished they could clap and cheer, feeling extremely gratified. Primarily, Cao Qianqiu had been hated for so many years. In the past, all parties dared not speak out in anger, enduring him because they were far from his match. Today, someone was attacking on their behalf, truly letting out a mouthful of pent-up rage.

At this moment, the area outside the plateau also saw surging winds and clouds, attracting people's attention, as battles had broken out there too.

Lu Zizai stood with his hands behind his back, while beneath him lay Pu Heng, Wei Yunqi, and four other masters, naturally provoking dissatisfaction from the factions of Cao Qianqiu and Sun Taichu. One of Sun Taichu's extremely powerful disciples entered the fray, intending to challenge Lu Zizai and rescue his senior martial brother Wei Yunqi; otherwise, their faction would lose too much face. Lu Junhao, a former "Immortal Seed," now a top figure beneath the Ancestor platform, erupted with immortal dao rune light. With every step he took, the entire grassland trembled violently. He was teleporting, traversing the night fog, and charging towards Lu Zizai!

At the same time, Li Qingxu, in a secluded spot, removed his mask, changed his clothes, and walked towards the battlefield, ready to face that old acquaintance.

Qin Ming stood silently on the grassland, facing the gazes of numerous Immortal Path disciples alone. His five-colored blade was raised, ethereal yet powerful, like a young deity descending to the mortal world. He alone obtained four portions of auspicious beast blood, surpassing everyone else, making it impossible not to draw attention. Coupled with some rumors about him, he was already a focal point.

"He is Qin Ming, Mountain Master, the god in my heart!" In the distance, Yu Que, carrying a small satchel and flapping her wings, whispered excitedly.

This area had many unique beings, including the young Four-Tusked White Elephant and the Purple Lightning Beast. The Purple Lightning Beast had transformed into a beautiful purple-haired woman, staring at the young man in the field, feeling suspicious, as if some past scenes seemed to overlap. Many old acquaintances were also watching, such as Li Qingyue, Ning Siqi, Chen Bingyan, and others, all aware of the old feud between Qin Ming and Li Qingxu. Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan found it truly unbelievable that Qin Ming, who had only embarked on the New Path seven or eight months ago, had already reached such a height, poised to challenge an Immortal Seed. In their perception, Qin Ming had no affinity with the Immortal Path, meaning he belonged to a different world than them. In past encounters, they had even subtly mocked him, feeling immensely superior. How could they have known that today, this old acquaintance would rise so fiercely, as a New Path cultivator, capable of directly facing all Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds, becoming the biggest dark horse in this competition for auspicious beast blood.

Li Qingxu walked with his sword drawn, his face cold. He knew that this old acquaintance, whom he had nearly beaten to death, was now exceptionally troublesome. They had already met while hunting demons on the plateau, each with another identity. He had fought Shen Wubing while wearing a mask and "narrowly lost," retreating at the time. Now, the opponent had specifically called him out, clearly intending to settle their past grievances, perhaps unaware that he was the masked man. Li Qingxu took a deep breath, preparing to go all out; he could not afford to lose in this identity again.

In a flash, he was like a ghost in the night fog sea, silently traversing hundreds of meters, as if riding his sword, arriving in the blink of an eye. Li Qingxu was like a sword-wielding immortal, imbued with Pure Yang consciousness light. His sword body streaked across the sky, shattering the night fog, directly reaching his opponent's glabella. The brilliant sword light was dazzling beyond compare.

"Clang!"

Qin Ming stood his ground, his feet unmoving. In his right hand, the five-colored blade, formed from heavenly light, was raised. With one strike, he sent Li Qingxu, along with his sword, flying. This strike was accompanied by the sound of wind and thunder, carrying five-colored divine radiance that illuminated the area and reflected the young man's determined eyes. Since he had been exposed, Qin Ming no longer remained low-key; he intended to face all opponents directly.

Ultimately, it would depend on whether the Ancestors could shake the Immortal Path, making figures like Cao Qianqiu no longer dare to interfere recklessly.

On the grassland, everyone was dumbfounded. With just one strike, he repelled his opponent. Li Qingxu's arm was numb, his consciousness light aching as if partly scorched. He stumbled backward, his face filled with shock. How could this be? On that plateau, while contending for the head of the third-realm old demon, the two had fought fiercely. How was it that he was now increasingly outmatched? Li Qingxu was unconvinced. He regrouped, adjusted his breathing, his consciousness light dazzling. He held his sword in one hand and pointed with the other, consciousness runes intertwining as he unleashed his sect's ultimate move—the Myriad Talisman Bag.

Back when Qin Ming had taken on the identity of "Demon One" in the secret realm, he had witnessed this formidable technique. At that time, he had indeed struggled to deal with it, but he had still broken through it. Now that his cultivation was higher, he dealt with this move effortlessly, his five-colored blade light cutting through the void, seemingly indestructible. Li Qingxu intended to use the Talisman Bag to trap his opponent and then refine him. But with a *boom*, the Myriad Talisman Bag was cleaved in half by the blade light, then exploded into fragments.

Swords and blades clashed, two figures flickered. Li Qingxu fought with all his might, but he still coughed blood and staggered backward. His mind trembled. The discarded pawn whom he had casually toyed with back then could now look down on him. He found it difficult to accept such a reversal. Back then, if he hadn't intentionally toyed with his opponent, a single blow would have been enough to blow this person apart. Meeting again, he was actually no match! This turn of events left him in the worst possible mood. He knew this person had survived and had embarked on the New Path a few months ago. At the time, he had simply smiled dismissively, believing that they were now worlds apart, on different planes. How could his opponent ever catch up to him? He was an Immortal Path disciple, Cao Qianqiu's student, and one of this generation's Immortal Seeds! It could be said that he was shrouded in layers of halos, standing proudly above all. Today, his halos were cut open by a five-colored blade; his extraordinary status was no longer impressive.

Li Qingxu erupted. He wanted to reclaim his name, to prove he wasn't the weakest Immortal Seed. He wanted to use all his trump cards and fight this old acquaintance to the end. He believed he could lose to anyone but the person before him. He was fighting desperately, and he was indeed very strong, clashing repeatedly with Qin Ming, constantly exchanging blows. After all, he was Cao Qianqiu's last disciple. However, after multiple exchanges, he was covered in blood, even having a wound on his neck, nearly decapitated at one point.

"Enough, Qingxu, quickly retreat! You've taken so many blows, that's enough to prove yourself!" From behind, several people secretly transmitted messages, clearly anxious and worried about him. Li Qingxu's mind reeled when he heard this. What did he hear? Did both his sect and his Li family clan members think this way? He was an Immortal Seed, born to look down on those from the New Path. But now, everyone thought that him being able to hold off Qin Ming for a moment was enough to prove himself? What kind of logic was this?! How long had it been for so many people to adopt this perception? Li Qingxu was furious. He didn't want to lose to the person he had once cast into the mundane world of fire.

*Bang!*

He flew horizontally, his body constantly spurting blood. In an instant, Qin Ming followed up, his five-colored blade chopping down at his head, intending to cleave him in half. With a *clang*, the long sword in Li Qingxu's hand snapped and shattered. At the same time, the consciousness light he released was ignited by his opponent's heavenly light force. The blade's edge sliced through his flesh, cutting open his forehead bone. The cold sensation and sharp blade light threatened to split him in two. At a critical moment, his consciousness light boiled, a life-saving trump card left by Cao Qianqiu, runes intertwining, carrying him away from the battlefield via instant teleportation. Qin Ming, holding his blade, was carried by five-colored light as if ascending, chasing after him.

"Come back," Lu Zizai transmitted secretly. He didn't want the people from the outer realms to resent Qin Ming too early. If there was to be slaughter today, let it begin with him. If anyone sought revenge, they could come find him.

At this time, Lu Zizai had also severely wounded his opponent. Lu Junhao, Sun Taichu's outstanding disciple, had desperately wanted to ignite his entire cultivation and defeat his opponent, but he was rapidly defeated instead. At the last moment, he severed his arm to survive, his Pure Yang consciousness body damaged, his entire arm burning and exploding. His so-called immortal characteristic was ineffective. Lu Zizai manipulated the Six Qi, turning his arm into ashes, completely obliterating it. Lu Zizai kept his word, deciding to begin the culling from the captives by executing Old Cao's direct disciples.

After Qin Ming stopped, everyone looked over. "Senior Brother Li... he actually lost so quickly." Zeng Yuan's lips trembled. In the past, he and Qin Ming had a good relationship until the latter became an outcast. He no longer associated with Qin Ming, instead siding with Li Qingxu, his rival. Now, looking at that old acquaintance, his expression was incredibly complex. Zheng Maoze's forehead was sweating, feeling that life's changes were unpredictable.

"That's my brother!" Ning Siqi was incredibly excited. His cousin, Wang Caiwei, was also deeply moved, watching the figure in the field.

"This is the current generation's prodigy from our Mountain River Academy. His worth speaks for itself; every move is effortless, defeating an Immortal Seed!" In the Kunling territory, many disciples from various academies were exhilarated. Whether acquaintances or strangers, everyone looking at the young man in the field showed astonishment. The New Path had indeed produced a figure with Ancestor potential!

Li Qingxu's face was pale. His defeat today filled him with endless resentment, strengthening his resolve to walk the "path of breaking and establishing." At this moment, the discussions about him in this area almost made him spit blood.

"The master never lost in his youth, but the disciple never won a crucial battle."
"Don't say that, Old Cao will probably be miserable today too!"

***

Qin Ming turned to look at the Immortal Seeds, scanning many faces. Immediately, this caused many people to show strange expressions. Lu Zizai had once told him to compete and challenge at the same level. Now, did he really want to weigh the most famous Immortal Path disciples? In fact, Qin Ming didn't intend to do that; he was merely looking at Cui Chonghe, repeatedly. What did that mean? The Cui family's faces immediately darkened.

"This ungrateful wretch, does he want to target the main family even in this situation?" Someone from the Cui family couldn't hold back. At the same time, someone immediately sent a message to Cui Chonghe, telling him that he absolutely must not suppress his cultivation to enter the fray. If he ever faced him in the future, he should directly crush him! Moreover, the Cui family believed that today's occasion was not suitable, and Cui Chonghe should not get involved in any karma.

On the other side, Lu Zizai struck, his Six Qi transforming into Six Emperors, blasting one of Cao Qianqiu's direct disciples to death. After the Six Emperors' force erupted, that mass of Pure Yang consciousness light ultimately turned to ashes.

"You...!" Someone cried out in shock and anger but was powerless to stop it.

"He's not only my master's direct disciple but also a distant relative. How could you...?" Another junior martial brother of Pu Heng spoke. Then, he fell silent, his mouth permanently shut. He too was sent on his way, directly refined by Lu Zizai. His immortal characteristic was utterly obliterated, eventually turning to dust. Pu Heng, also a prisoner, was more obedient, remaining silent, which was uncharacteristic of his usual strong and domineering demeanor.

Everyone was appalled. Lu Zizai had actually killed two direct disciples of an Ancestor-level figure on the spot! At this moment, Lu Zizai's gaze also flickered towards Pu Heng. The latter's hair immediately stood on end!

Everyone felt that both the old and young of the New Path had gone mad today. Were they trying to completely shake the Immortal Path?

***

At this moment, deep within the plateau, Cao Qianqiu was incredibly furious, unleashing various ultimate techniques as he battled the New Path Ancestors. With one finger pointing to the sky, endless clouds surged, carrying various essences from beyond the world, transforming into a giant golden millstone. With his other finger pointing to the ground, earth light steamed upwards like boundless mercury surging towards the sky. Old Cao's use of this ultimate technique was immeasurably more powerful than his disciples'. In an instant, both golden and silver lights, heavy and vast, converged as if heaven and earth were truly closing in, intending to crush the New Path Ancestors into a bloody paste.

"Little brat, that won't do!" Qingtian Ancestor roared. He was like Pangu splitting heaven and earth. His right hand's heavenly light energy materialized into a giant axe, and with a *rumble*, it cleaved apart the golden and silver heaven and earth, shattering the cloud-like millstone. Simultaneously, Jiang Zhiyuan of the Yin-Yang Temple submerged Cao Qianqiu in black and white qi.

"This time, I'll cripple you!"

Qingtian Ancestor immediately advanced, striking downwards. Old Cao suffered heavy damage this time, his consciousness light dimming considerably. This was because he was cleaved in half by Qingtian, and even though he reassembled, he was still affected. Primarily, while the few Ancestors were fighting Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan, their main focus was on him alone.

*Boom!*

With a strike from the Tathagata of This Era, Old Cao's body exploded! Lu Yu's Six Emperor manifestations, six figures, came forward, locking down every part of Old Cao's newly reassembled body. With a *puff*, it was hard to imagine the usually gentle Six Emperors Ancestor being so violent, tearing off Old Cao's head.

"I..." Cao Qianqiu's anger soared to the heavens. Since his emergence, he had never suffered such a great loss. His cultivation was being damaged, being weakened; these people were working together to cripple him! He voluntarily caused his Pure Yang consciousness light to explode, then reformed himself in the distance. However, the Yuqing Ancestor had long been waiting. With a point of his finger, a heavenly light lotus descended, blasting him into four or five pieces. The next instant, Qingtian arrived. This time, his large hand solidly slapped Cao Qianqiu's face, four times in succession.

"You are indeed stronger than your master. Back then, he only took two slaps from me!" Qingtian Ancestor said.

"You old geezer..." Cao Qianqiu was on the verge of exploding from rage.

*Boom!*

Under the combined assault of the five Ancestors, Cao Qianqiu exploded on the spot!
