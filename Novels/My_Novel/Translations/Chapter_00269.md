Chapter 269: A Wife Who Knows Her Man, Colorful Skirt Seeks the Gate, An Adventure Under the River, Mistakenly Entering a Bandit Ship

Wen Caishang stood quietly, meticulously arranging her hair and adjusting her silver hairpin. Her beautiful eyes held a mix of feigned anger and hidden joy, like a silkworm seeking thread—she knew Li Xian must be here. With her hands clasped before her, her aura was cool and composed. Bathed in moonlight, she seemed to radiate a soft halo.

Her long skirt trailed to the ground, exuding grace and elegance. It was called the "Skirt of Retained Moonlight for Visiting Immortals," meaning that under the moonlight, the special fabric of the skirt could capture the moon's glow, making her look like a fairy.

Footsteps echoed in the courtyard.

Someone muttered, "Who could it be at this late hour?" The crimson door was pushed open. The man was clearly wealthy, dressed in fine brocade.

It was Tian Fu.

Tian Fu was momentarily stunned upon seeing Wen Caishang. *Strange, strange...* he thought. *Why are all the people these days so handsome and beautiful? Have the celestial fairies descended to the mortal world en masse?*

He was a local tyrant in his own right and a notorious womanizer. Indulging in flowers, the moon, and romantic affairs was second nature to him. Yet, compared to the woman before him, he felt utterly vulgar.

Noticing Wen Caishang's slight frown, he found himself lost in wild fantasies, feeling an inexplicable shyness. He lowered his head and saluted, asking, "This lady..." He had intended to call her "miss," but sensing her mature charm and the complete lack of youthful innocence in her brows, with a faint blush on her cheeks as if searching for a lover, he thought it more appropriate to address her as "madam." So he said, "This madam, are you also... here to see the mansion?"

Wen Caishang thought to herself, *That poor boy, Li Xian, left me. Where would he get the money to buy a mansion? He must be using the excuse of viewing the property to swindle people and consume his precious elixirs. He knows the Golden Light Elixir recipe and happened to obtain the Yellow Nine Ginseng, so he's scheming this.*

*No one knows a man like his wife.* Li Xian was someone she had personally cultivated. Although she hadn't revealed the clan's secret arts to him, she understood his temperament completely.

Wen Caishang smiled. "Of course. Otherwise, why would I come in the middle of the night for fun?"

Tian Fu said awkwardly, "It's rather unfortunate, but this mansion has caught the eye of a great personage." Wen Caishang's smile widened. "Oh? What great personage? He probably hasn't paid yet, has he? Since he hasn't paid the silver, shouldn't I be able to see the mansion?"

Tian Fu said, "He hasn't paid. But... this person prefers quiet. We have a verbal agreement to let him stay for a few days to experience the tranquility. If it suits him, he will purchase it. A person of his stature—even if the deal falls through, it's not good to offend him. So, madam... I'm truly sorry."

Wen Caishang found it amusing. *That little liar not only deceived me but has also swindled others so thoroughly. That mouth of his... it sounds so sweet when he's being charming, but it's truly hateful when he's lying.*

She said, "Since you're afraid of offending him, are you not afraid of offending me? Just lead the way inside. I'll view the mansion and admire the flowers. If I happen to run into him, I'll explain it to him myself."

With a gentle sweep of her sleeve, Tian Fu felt the world spin and his body grow weightless. By the time he came to his senses, he was standing firmly on the bluestone path in the courtyard, several yards away from the crimson gate. He was terrified. If this madam wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as turning her hand.

Wen Caishang stood a yard away, her gaze drifting into the distance. "Lead the way," she said softly.

Seeing the situation, Tian Fu had no choice but to agree. He straightened his jade pendant and hair crown and led the way through the garden.

Wen Caishang said, "Tell me everything he said and did, in detail." Tian Fu was taken aback. "Why?"

Wen Caishang's voice was gentle but carried an edge of impatience. "Don't ask so many questions." Tian Fu didn't dare to ask more and did as he was told.

Passing the "Green Pine Stone," Tian Fu repeated what Li Xian had said. Though there were some minor discrepancies, the gist was the same.

Wen Caishang thought of the past at the mountain villa, when the two of them had walked together. She had taught Li Xian how to appreciate objects and scenery, and that little thief had used it here.

Wen Caishang said softly, "He's not entirely wrong, but not entirely right either. This Green Pine Stone isn't from Mount Su."

Tian Fu said, "Madam... this..." He thought to himself, when he had bought it, the merchant had personally assured him it was genuine. How could it be fake?

Wen Caishang smiled. "He's... only half-baked at best. Enough to fool you lot, but in the art of appraising objects, he still needs a lot of practice."

Her voice was sweet as she gently stroked the Green Pine Stone. "Look at this stone. It's as moist as jade, half-green, half-yellow. The patterns are natural, formed by the scouring of water. It's actually a 'Riverbed Ballast Stone' from the bottom of a river. You've been cheated."

"These stones,阴寒不见天日 (yin cold, never seeing the sun), are passed off as Green Pine Stones because they look slightly similar."

Tian Fu said, "How is that possible?"

Wen Caishang said, "If you don't believe me, I'll split it open." She flipped her sleeve and drew a sword, casually splitting the massive stone. Yellowish water flowed out from within...

It was the murky water that had accumulated over years at the bottom of the river.

Wen Caishang said, "Ballast stones are produced at the bottom of lakes. Soaked by water, they contain yellow liquid inside. They're considered bad feng shui objects. You have a taste for luxury and used your family's wealth to personally arrange the garden scenery. But... the intricacies of it all, how could you possibly understand? Naturally, you were thoroughly swindled without realizing it."

"The fact that you've ended up selling the house is a sign that was there all along."

Tian Fu was speechless with shock, standing frozen. Wen Caishang smiled. "Hurry up and lead the way. Where did he go next?"

Tian Fu responded with three affirmatives, his attitude subtly shifting to one of reverence as he led the way past the "Calligraphy and Painting Pavilion," the "Herb and Tree Corridor," the "Rocky Forest of Artificial Mountains," and many other garden scenes.

A few days ago, Li Xian had displayed his talent and eloquence, speaking with great confidence. Tian Fu had been immensely impressed, and many of his arguments were deeply remembered, which he now recounted one by one.

Wen Caishang first listened to Tian Fu's recitation of Li Xian's words, shaking her head and smiling, her expression lively. The gloom of the past few days seemed to dissipate, as if Li Xian were right beside her, watching him swindle people—it was incredibly amusing. But after listening, she would always correct him, providing a deeper analysis.

She had to one-up Li Xian.

Her knowledge was vast, and her vision broad. If she had the time, a single painting or a single plant could lead to a discussion of many esoteric subjects. Three days and three nights would not be enough to talk about it all. If Li Xian were here, she would be happy to talk, to stroll and flirt. But Wen Caishang had limited patience and was too lazy to say much to Tian Fu. When it came to appreciating objects and scenery, she would simply refute Li Xian's points or point out his mistakes, and then stop.

At the end, she would always add a few curses: "that brat," "that little thief," "stinky boy."

Tian Fu was astonished by Wen Caishang's profound knowledge. Hearing her constantly belittle Li Xian, he found it very strange. Although that young master had some errors in his speech, he was elegant and truly knowledgeable. Gradually, he realized that the two of them had another kind of relationship.

Tian Fu asked, "Madam, if I may be so bold, what is your relationship with that young master..."

Wen Caishang stopped and said with a resentful air, "He is my husband."

"Ah!" Tian Fu said, "Then... they are indeed a good match." Wen Caishang was delighted. "Alright. Call him out for me. I'm taking him back to the manor."

"And this mansion?" Tian Fu asked, confused.

Wen Caishang shook her head. "Don't you understand? My husband, with his glib tongue, loves to lie. He's a romantic wastrel, and all his money is probably spent on clothes. How could he afford your mansion? What 'tranquility'? It was all a lie to stay here for a few days."

Tian Fu said, "This... this..." Wen Caishang said, "But I'm different. Buying your mansion is as easy as turning my hand. If he really likes it, I'll indulge him. Anyway... just call him out. Bring him to the pavilion in the middle of the lake."

Wen Caishang said, "He should be in the secret room."

Tian Fu said, "Young Master... it is the fortune of a lifetime to have earned your favor."

Wen Caishang said resentfully, "Of course." She walked gracefully to the pavilion in the center of the lake, propping her chin on her hand. "It's just that this dead boy doesn't know what's good for him."

Tian Fu said, "I'll go call him right away."

He knew where the secret room was. In his early years, supported by his family, he had practiced martial arts and long since reached the Food Essence realm. The threshold that scattered martial artists struggled to cross their entire lives was easily overcome by the scions of noble families. But later, his martial arts talent proved insufficient, and he couldn't grasp the essentials of the Tian family's martial arts, so he gradually shifted to business and management.

Naturally, he received fewer of the family's precious elixirs. This secret room was built for meditation. Later... after taking a wife and concubines, he often came here for pleasure.

With practiced ease, he pushed open the secret room door. There was no one inside, but there was burnt-out candle wax. He searched around, then hurried back to report the situation to Wen Caishang.

Wen Caishang's brows furrowed slightly, but she soon relaxed and spat, "If this boy were so easy to catch, I would have lost my life long ago. The longer you run, the worse the punishment will be."

She had thought the mansion was acceptable. If she had caught Li Xian, she could have stayed here with him, recounting their feelings. Her wish was unfulfilled, and she couldn't help but feel a flash of anger.

She wouldn't stay any longer. She summoned her ancestral silkworm to track his trail once more.

Meanwhile...

After practicing the "Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidity and Gathering Yang Meridian," Li Xian's five senses were sharp. When he heard Tian Fu knocking on the door, he felt a vague sense of unease.

*Since Tian Fu has found me, I can't stay here anymore. Time to pack up and run. Being chased around like this is no way to live. Sigh... I need to think of a way to practice peacefully and improve my strength.*

Li Xian traveled light. He acted on his thoughts, easily vaulting the courtyard wall and sneaking away under the cover of night. Tian Fu, unaware of this, searched the courtyard for a long time. Because the courtyard was so large, even though he couldn't find Li Xian, it never occurred to him that Li Xian had already fled.

By the time Wen Caishang knocked on the door, he had turned to entertain her, and the two of them had toured the garden scenes again. All this had taken up a considerable amount of time.

On the post road outside the city.

After several days of rest, Li Xian had made progress in both martial and mystical arts. After consuming the "Yellow Nine Ginseng," his body retained five hundred strands of heaven and earth essence. He was slowly digesting them and wouldn't have to worry for months.

A gentle breeze blew, and moonlight dew fell. Distant mountains stood tall, and a great river flowed in his view.

His hair fluttered lightly as he pondered his future path.

He didn't seek fame among the lords, but only a stable life, a reputation, and freedom without restraint. Strengthening himself was the foundation, to help fulfill Lu Dong's last wishes—the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, the Sword-Controlling Art. As for the marriage contract, it was an old story from thousands of years ago, and he had no heart to interfere.

He had recently heard that the "Yue Shan Sword Sect" was widely recruiting talented disciples. The Yue Shan Sword Sect was a famous swordsmanship sect within the Yu'nan Dao. Wen Caishang had also spoken highly of it, praising its deep foundation in swordsmanship. Many essential martial arts principles were worth studying and practicing. Li Xian thought that if he could join the Yue Shan Sword Sect, he would have a way to solve his problems with money, martial arts, and connections. Moreover, he heard that this sect was very upright and its swordsmanship profound. Yue Shan was also a world-famous mountain, with magnificent scenery and clouds and mist swirling around it...

He couldn't help but feel向往 (longing).

Yu'nan Dao consisted of "Seven Prefectures, Six States, and Nine Cities." The region was vast. Li Xian had followed the Flowering River, passing through Yu'nan and Longxiong... The places he had been were far apart, but he had never truly experienced the vastness of the two regions.

Li Xian收敛 (converged) his scattered thoughts. Since he was fleeing, he wouldn't rest easily. After several days of rest, his energy was abundant. His five viscera processed turbidity, nourishing his blood and strengthening his body.

The post road wound its way along, with mountains and rivers visible along the way.

He saw the turbulent river. He had wanted to take a boat several times, but after experiencing the process of "clear rising and turbid sinking," he wanted to stay away from the water.

This time, it was the same. He wanted to拐入 (turn into) the mountain path, passing through treacherous mountains and bad lands.

Suddenly, he felt a deep unease in his heart, as if a great danger was about to befall him. His mind raced, guessing: *Could it be that Master, the Black-Faced Bat King? Or the Luo family? Or perhaps the Madam?*

He had provoked many enemies. If he counted them all, Wen Caishang was by far the most terrifying. Li Xian thought to himself, *If the Madam finds me, she'll definitely挖 my eyes and砍 my legs... just like the old servant in the Leisure Martial Pavilion.*

The feeling grew stronger, his heart burning like fire. His heart skipped a beat, and he was almost certain that Wen Caishang was nearby. This feeling had no basis, relying solely on intuition. Yet he was incredibly sure.

In fact, it wasn't just intuition.

The two of them had cultivated the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword, leaving a deep brand. A spiritual connection was only natural.

Wen Caishang had branded the sword seal. Li Xian was the Sword Master, and Wen Caishang was the Sword Attendant. When Li Xian felt fear, he could vaguely sense it. Therefore, when Wen Caishang was nearby, his heart would burn, and his intuition would be strong.

Li Xian felt increasingly uneasy. Seeing the towering trees on one side and the mountains all around, he thought of plunging into the forest to escape using the complex terrain. But upon careful consideration... who was Wen Caishang? Her feng shui skills were so powerful that she could accurately find him even from hundreds of miles away. How could a mere mountain terrain trap him?

Li Xian forced himself to be calm, but felt that although the world was vast, there was no path to take. He looked at the wide river and suddenly thought: *The river flows endlessly. Perhaps only this can help me escape. I've already exchanged all my silkworm threads, yet Wen Caishang can still come for me. There must be something on me that still allows her to pinpoint my location.*

*I'll jump into the river. The rushing current might be able to mask my trail. Even if it can't, I can use the water to propel me, and my speed will be much faster.*

Li Xian held the "Azure Water Pearl" in his mouth and jumped into the river.

Instantly, he felt extremely heavy. He sank rapidly to the riverbed. The current washed over him; it was deep and dark, hiding infinite terror. He used all his swimming techniques, paddling and kicking... he could move back and forth without hindrance, but trying to rise even half a foot was incredibly difficult.

If he didn't have the "Azure Water Pearl" in his mouth, he would have drowned. Li Xian used the push of the current; one step could cover several yards. The speed was unimaginable. But it was昏暗 (dark and dim), and he had no sense of time.

The deep, murky water disturbed the perception of the silkworm thread. Wen Caishang frowned slightly, her heart resonating with his. She knew that Li Xian had sensed her existence and had designed another escape.

She let out a cold laugh. "Good boy..."

Meanwhile, at the bottom of the river, more than a dozen zhang deep.

Li Xian activated his "Double Pupils" to observe the details. The riverbed was thick with mud and silt. Wrecks of ships, white bones, giant snakes, and fish beasts flashed before his eyes.

Li Xian pressed the "Azure Water Pearl" under his tongue, stoking a furnace in his belly, burning firewood and lighting a flame, boiling the qi and refining the clear. He spat out white mist. The water immediately became clear.

Because the clear rises and the turbid sinks, he remained firmly on the riverbed. Every step he took would inevitably stir up the sand and mud, blurring his vision. And the river current always pushed him forward.

When he first descended to the riverbed, it was dark and murky, with a swift current. Aside from that, it was manageable. But after walking for a while, the dangers of the river gradually revealed their ferocity.

Li Xian took a step, and his right foot sank deeply into the mud. The river stretched for thousands of miles, and the conditions at the bottom were varied and strange. The silt here had accumulated for hundreds or even thousands of years, turning into a swamp at the bottom of the river.

Having undergone the process of "clear rising and turbid sinking," he sank again and again, about to be swallowed by the silt.

Even with the Azure Water Pearl, it was extremely dangerous.

Traveling at the bottom of the river was a strange tactic, but the dangerous situations were even more severe than on land. Li Xian forced himself to be calm and drew his "Sinking River Sword." He thought wryly, *Sinking River Sword, Sinking River Sword, this time, my brother, we're really going to sink in the river.*

He plunged the sword into the silt. Stirring it vigorously, the silt, washed by the water, became loose and turbid. Li Xian used the opportunity to pull his right foot out, paddled away, and moved several yards.

But for the next several dozen miles, it was all silt swamps. Li Xian used the push of the current. Although he traveled fast, covering several yards in a single stride, every time his foot touched the riverbed, it sank.

After traveling a few more miles.

Li Xian gradually came to a realization. The silt at the bottom of the river was sticky and could not be stepped on solidly. He could roll his body to prevent his feet from sinking into the silt, and this would also make his journey faster.

Li Xian had been hunted down many times, but he had accumulated experience with each battle. He was always making progress, and the more dangerous the situation, the calmer he became. Although his current situation was forced upon him by Wen Caishang, he didn't feel wronged or resentful. Because he had risen from a humble background, he had to pay more, and he had to be prepared for the pain of being 'overwhelmed' by the powerful.

He had to respond calmly and seek change in stillness.

*But today's experience... if I have the chance in the future, I'll really defeat the Madam and get my revenge. If I can completely conquer her with my strength, would I still be so afraid of her?*

His heart burned with passion, and he desired to become stronger even more.

He used the scouring of the water, along with the "Azure Silk Palm" to paddle. He leaped forward, covering several yards in an instant. But every time he rose half a zhang, the characteristic of "clear rising and turbid sinking" would pull him down. It was just like an ordinary clay figure jumping on flat ground.

Li Xian was agile. Every time he was about to land, he would roll his body, never sinking into the silt.

This time, as he leaped, he suddenly saw a huge rock at the bottom of the river, almost crashing into him head-on. Li Xian quickly paddled to the side, narrowly avoiding it.

He didn't know how long he had traveled.

The riverbed grew deeper and deeper, exuding a faint chill. He suddenly cried out in dismay. His Double Pupils saw through the murky water to a vertical deep hole that had suddenly appeared on the riverbed ahead.

It was pitch black, and he couldn't see the bottom.

Li Xian quickly stopped his momentum. But the river was torrential, and this deep hole had appeared suddenly. Li Xian was being pushed by the current; how could he stop on a dime? He was pushed to the top of the vertical hole and began to plummet.

Li Xian quickly paddled, trying to swim to the opposite wall of the hole before he reached the bottom. He reached out to grab the wall, but only got a handful of mud and sand. How could he steady himself?

If he kept sinking, endlessly, how could he survive? Li Xian quickly drew his sword and plunged it deep into the wall of the hole.

This dark hole seemed to have been dug out of the mud and sand. The walls were also mud and sand. Li Xian's sinking momentum was strong. The Sinking River Sword was inserted several feet into the sandy wall, but he was still slowly sinking.

Li Xian pondered: *It needs to go deeper.* He secretly channeled his internal qi, and a sword light flashed. The Sinking River Sword was completely submerged in the sandy wall, slowing his descent by half.

Li Xian's feet exerted force. His left leg used the "Vast and Boundless Leg," and his right leg used the "Gentle Breeze Leg." He kicked deeply into the quicksand wall, his calves sinking into the wall, using the force to support himself.

This finally stabilized his balance, and he sank no further. Li Xian breathed a sigh of relief.

*I'm really a reckless cub. I underestimated the dangers of nature. I thought that after leaving Tiger's Cry Ridge, I had a rough understanding of dangerous places. This Azure Water River, with people coming and going, ships sailing back and forth... I thought it wouldn't have anything strange. Relying on the magic of the Azure Water Pearl, I dared to jump into the great river.*

*Who knew that at the bottom of the river, a strange sand hole would appear for no reason.*

A deep chill seeped into his skin. Li Xian used his qi to resist, but still felt his hands and feet go numb with cold. He activated his Double Pupils and stared intently at the depths of the hole. Suddenly, he felt a gaze upon him.

Then... the vertical hole shook violently. Li Xian had好不容易 (with great difficulty) stabilized his position, but because of the shaking of the sand and mud, the soil became loose, and he began to sink again.

Li Xian knew this place could not be stayed in for long. There seemed to be something strange at the bottom of the hole. His Double Pupils vaguely caught a glimpse of some scales, a tombstone, and water plants... as if it was a giant turtle carrying a great tomb on its back.

But the giant turtle was in a deep slumber.

Li Xian stabilized his situation and looked upwards. There was still a distance of ten zhang to the top of the hole. As long as he could climb up, he could resolve the danger. But the river was vast and mysterious. Who knew if there were other dangerous holes or other giant creatures hidden within?

This distance of ten zhang would be extremely easy for a first-rate martial artist. For Li Xian, it was as difficult as reaching the sky. He thought of countermeasures. Although he had many miscellaneous items on him, none would be of use.

Li Xian was naturally clever and soon came up with a strange plan. He brandished the Sinking River Sword and钻进 (drilled into) the sandy wall. The sand was coarse, not as gentle as water. Once he buried himself in the sand, he could sink no further. Then he moved in the sand, "swimming" upwards bit by bit.

After expending a great deal of effort, he finally钻出 (drilled out) of the sand and soil. Having resolved the danger, he no longer dared to be careless. Every step he took thereafter, he was extremely vigilant. Thanks to the power of his Double Pupils, he could see the condition of the riverbed clearly and avoided many dangers in advance.

But there were always some dangers that were extremely hard to avoid. After traveling several dozen miles, he came to a dangerous area rich in water plants. From his Double Pupils' view, it was like an oasis in the water, lush green, teeming with fish and shrimp, beautiful and serene.

However, upon entering the water plant area, he saw that the fish and shrimp were all covered with many black spots. They were some kind of blood-sucking poisonous insects, extremely powerful,钻入 (钻入) human skin and flesh. This was a waterscape with a terrible reputation.

Moreover, the water plants grew fine hairs that entangled living creatures, and the hairs pierced the body, absorbing blood. Li Xian didn't dare to force his way through and wanted to climb ashore. But he discovered that the soil in this waterscape could repel the poisonous insects and poisonous plants.

So he passed through safely.

He traveled for about a day. Li Xian felt that he had swum a long distance. Even if Wen Caishang pursued him relentlessly, it would be difficult for her to catch up immediately. If he continued to潜 (dive) and flee in the river, the horrors at the bottom were numerous, and it was hard to predict if he could protect himself. It would be too frustrating to be buried at the bottom of the river. So he prepared to go ashore.

The river was wide.

To get ashore, Li Xian first had to find the riverbank. He had to climb out of the water along the muddy and rocky walls of the bank. And when he was in the middle of the wide river, it was dark all around, making it hard to distinguish east from west or north from south, which was very difficult to handle.

Li Xian possessed Double Pupils, and his vision was extremely strong. He could see much farther than others. After clearly seeing the surrounding objects, he would choose a direction and move sideways against the current, and he would eventually find the bank.

He was very methodical. By applying simple principles to the extreme, he could always find a way to live.

Suddenly, he felt something trip his foot. He had kicked a very heavy iron object. Looking down, it was an anchor. Li Xian was delighted. *If I follow the anchor and climb onto the ship, I can use the ship to escape and save my strength.*

He grabbed the iron chain and climbed upwards. Gradually leaving the riverbed, the current became clearer, and the water grew warmer. Li Xian had been浸泡 (soaked) in the river for a day, and the dampness had entered his body, condensing a chill. Fortunately, he had mastered the "Heart Fire" attribute, boiling his blood to drive away the cold and expel the dampness.

Soon, he saw the bottom of the ship. Li Xian climbed along the hull and gradually脱离 (broke free) from the water. His body suddenly felt light. He felt incredibly畅快 (carefree). Looking around, he saw a clear blue sky like it had been washed, with no clouds for ten thousand miles, and the rippling water was endlessly beautiful. After this experience, if he ever had to潜江 (dive into the river) to escape again in the future, he would have to think it over carefully.

潜江 (Diving into the river) was not difficult. But潜入江底 (diving to the bottom of the river) was extremely difficult. Li Xian climbed onto the ship and lay on the deck, enjoying the sunlight. He saw it was an ordinary merchant ship and secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Even if he was discovered, he could just pay the fare.

Not long after, the sound of footsteps came from the cabin. More than ten people came out one after another. All of them had strange expressions, looking Li Xian up and down.

One person shouted, "Where did this water bandit come from? Do you have a death wish, daring to board our ship!"

Li Xian activated his "Heart Fire," the chill completely gone, his body warm. He smiled and said, "Everyone, I'm sorry. I was a merchant traveler. The wind and rain were heavy on the road, and I accidentally fell into the water. Washed by the current, I bumped into this merchant ship and climbed up without permission."

"I'm not a water bandit. I just want a ride on your ship. As for the fare, I will definitely pay it in full."

The people looked at each other and suddenly burst into laughter. They all surrounded him, setting up some kind of formation, tightly surrounding Li Xian. Those people laughed and scolded, "How interesting, how extremely interesting. This guy is probably a constable. Somehow he discovered our trail, exposed his tracks, and is deliberately lying to deceive us."

"Exactly, how could such a coincidence happen in the world? But this fellow is quite厉害 (capable). Our concealment method is so powerful, yet he was able to find us."

"It's just luck. We..."

While the crowd was making a racket, they suddenly heard two "coughs." The crowd parted to make way, and a middle-aged man walked out.

He had thick black hair, but his temples were gray. He was tall and handsome. He said, "What's the situation?"

A young disciple beside him whispered in his ear, explaining the situation. The middle-aged man said, "I see... we are being pursued. Don't bother with whether this小子 (boy) is real or fake. Just kill him and feed him to the fish."

The crowd immediately closed in, holding sabers, spears, staffs, and clubs, ready to rush forward all at once. Several of them took the lead in a formation and actually beat their chest drums. They had already reached the Food Essence level!

Li Xian frowned, knowing this ship was no ordinary vessel. The enemy was numerous and powerful, and the middle-aged man's strength was unfathomable. Surrounded by water, the dangers were可想而知 (easy to imagine). A direct fight would definitely lead to loss, and escaping into the river would be even harder to protect himself.

Li Xian's mind raced. He observed carefully, seeking a change in the situation. Suddenly, he was startled, thinking of a crucial point. He said in a loud voice, "Wait! It's a misunderstanding. We are on the same side."

"Oh?" the middle-aged man said. "What same side? Tell me... what side are we on?"

Li Xian said, "I am also a disciple of the Flower Cage Gate."
