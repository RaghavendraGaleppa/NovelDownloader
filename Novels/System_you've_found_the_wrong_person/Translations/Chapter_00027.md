# Chapter 27: Three Origins United, Contending with Heaven  

Outside Jianmen Pass.  

The howling wind lashed against faces like knives, forcing people to squint against the stinging pain.  

Dou Changsheng sat at a tea stall, downing a bowl of cold tea in one gulp before speaking, "Since ancient times, all gatherings must come to an end. The military pay has been delivered to Jianmen Pass, and the ensuing conflicts no longer concern us. It's time for me to bid you both farewell."  

Black Eagle Venerable raised a hand to stop him from leaving immediately and said slowly, "Brother Dou, your chivalry and righteousness are unmatched, earning the admiration of all under heaven. For the sake of the military pay, you repeatedly overcame formidable foes and twice entered Jianmen Pass. The General's Office is deeply grateful and naturally has a substantial reward for you. Have you ever considered entering official service?"  

"If you wish to serve, there are several options. First, you could join the General's Office. Given your merits, you could either remain at headquarters or take up a military post in the provinces. Second, the General's Office could recommend you for a local magistracy. Several county magistrate positions are vacant in the Northern Territories, and you could assume office immediately. Third, you could leave the Northern Territories and serve elsewhere, though I wouldn't recommend it. A man is always at a disadvantage away from home—no matter how harsh the North is, it's still home."  

After listening carefully, Dou Changsheng shook his head decisively. "No, thank you. I have no intention of entering official service."  

The Northern Territories were in turmoil, and the General's Office bore the brunt of it. Established by the Great General Who Guards the North, Yu Yun, the office was viewed with suspicion by the imperial court. If not for Yu Yun willingly traveling alone to the capital and submitting to imprisonment, this so-called "General's Office" would be nothing short of a warlord's stronghold—overseeing military affairs, noble families, clans, sects, and the common folk of the North. In essence, it governed all civil affairs in all but name.  

Yu Yun had risen to prominence by resisting the northern barbarians. Year after year, his authority grew, and the General's Office expanded into a colossal entity. His nine adopted sons were all grandmasters, three of whom ranked on the Earthly Rankings, renowned for their valor in battle. Other grandmasters, such as the Invincible Iron Fist Old Master Yuan, further underscored the office's immense power.  

Yu Yun's every move could sway the tides of the realm. With 200,000 border troops at his command, a single southward march could alter the fate of the empire.  

The more Dou Changsheng learned about Yu Yun, the more he sensed the man's complexity. The General's Office had undoubtedly amassed excessive power—how else could it have grown so formidable? Yet, at the emperor's mere decree, Yu Yun had willingly surrendered himself and been imprisoned.  

If he were truly a power-hungry minister, he could have feigned illness and refused to comply. With the four great nations—and numerous smaller states—locked in conflict, a mere hint of collusion with Western Qin or Eastern Qi would have deterred the imperial court from acting rashly. Had he wished, Yu Yun could have easily declared himself King of the North—or styled himself as King of Zhao or Yan.  

The Northern Territories were treacherous waters, and Dou Changsheng had no desire to be dragged into their depths. Now that the military pay had been delivered, it was the perfect time to make his exit.  

Black Eagle Venerable fell silent for a long moment. Both he and the General's Office had hoped Dou Changsheng would join their ranks—they desperately needed men of noble background, exceptional talent, and sterling character. Though tempted to persuade him further, Black Eagle Venerable restrained himself. With the North in turmoil, this was no time to press the matter.  

After reorganizing his thoughts, he said, "Brother Dou, as a man of the wilds, you've only learned fragments of martial arts. What you lack most is systematic training. Thus, the General's Office has dispatched an expert to personally instruct you for a time. This is a rare opportunity—please make the most of it."  

With that, Black Eagle Venerable rose, followed by Zhao Manren. Both bowed deeply to Dou Changsheng in gratitude for his life-saving deeds before departing together.  

Just as Dou Changsheng prepared to stand, a hand pressed down on his shoulder, instantly sapping all his strength and reducing him to the frailty of an infant.  

Startled at first, he quickly realized this must be the expert sent by the General's Office.  

A hoarse voice spoke, "Such pure and profound Three Origins Unity Qi—yet it flows naturally, uncontrolled. Truly extraordinary."  

An elderly man stood beside him. Dou Changsheng strained to see the man's face, but no matter how wide he opened his eyes, the features remained indistinct—only the vague impression of a medium-built elder.  

The old man clasped his hands behind his back and said calmly, "Your spirit is not yet cultivated enough to pierce illusions and perceive reality. If I choose not to be seen, no mortal eyes may behold me."  

Without waiting for a response, he continued, "My time here is limited. How much you learn depends on your talent and comprehension."  

"The Three Origins Unity Art originates from ancient times, created by sages. It embodies benevolence, loyalty, and courage. When the three unite, one may contend with heaven itself!"  

"To begin, choose one path to cultivate. Your innate qi manifests as white—the path of courage. This is the most common choice, favored by warriors who press forward undaunted by hardship."  

"Memorize the 'Three Origins Unity Art - Innate Chapter' carefully. I will recite it only once. Whether you remember it fully—or at all—is up to you."  

Over ten thousand words of the Innate Three Realms flowed into Dou Changsheng's ears, each syllable imbued with a mesmerizing power that etched itself into his mind. He didn't even need to focus—the words engraved themselves indelibly, as if even a simpleton could recite them flawlessly.  

The elder's once-mysterious image instantly crumbled. A tough exterior, but a heart of gold.  

"Remarkable talent. After just one recitation, you've already mastered it perfectly."  

"The 'Three Origins Unity Art - Divine Chapter' is a closely guarded secret of the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou. I don't possess it—you'll have to seek it there yourself in the future."  

"Your qi is as vast as mountains and seas—clearly, you've encountered extraordinary fortune. Do not squander it."  

"The 'Boundless Sword Art' suits you well. But when you drew your sword at Jianmen Pass, though the sword energy seemed overwhelming, it was scattered and unfocused—just like that martial artist you slew outside Chen Fortress. You've strayed from the right path."  

"Quantity isn't the mistake—the mistake lies in lacking quality."  

"The Hero's Sword was forged by the Tang Clan of Jiangdu, renowned for their weapon-smithing. As the current heir, Tang He poured his heart into this blade. Advancing it to a treasure-grade weapon is a near certainty, and with the right opportunity, it could even evolve into a divine weapon."  

"Contemplate the Hero's Sword, nurture its spirit, and fuse its sharpness into the 'Boundless Sword Art.' Then, that pitiful 'Peacock Spreads Its Tail' technique from Five Beauties Valley wouldn't withstand a single casual stroke of your sword."  

"Such opportunists who claw their way onto the Human Rankings are a disgrace."  

What a pity.  

Dou Changsheng couldn't follow him for ten years of secluded training before reentering the world. Otherwise, by twenty-eight, he would undoubtedly rank first on the Human Rankings.
