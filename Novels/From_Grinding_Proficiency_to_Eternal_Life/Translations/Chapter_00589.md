# Chapter 589: Quantity First, Quality Second

“An ant of the Foundation Establishment realm dares to launch a sneak attack on me?”

Xu Yunfan snorted coldly, his figure instantly vanishing from its high-speed charge.

It was the manifestation of his physical body’s power exploding to its limit, moving so fast it surpassed the naked eye’s ability to capture.

The next moment, he had already appeared like a ghost behind the massive broken pillar where the attacker was hiding.

A thin, small figure clad in a drab, obscure robe was clutching its arm, its face deathly pale and eyes filled with terror.

When Xu Yunfan saw the attacker clearly, he couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.

It was the Zimo True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect, a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator who practiced pure demonic methods. His demonic power was specialized in shadows, and he had condensed a Foundation of Earthly Evil Shadows.

However, the path he had chosen was a narrow one.

The Dao Fruit he aimed for, the Nether Dao Fruit of Ten Thousand Transformations, belonged to the category of Turbid Qi Dao Fruits. It wasn't something of high standing, and he had been in seclusion for many years. His life had peaked.

“So it’s you, Zimo, this ant.”

Xu Yunfan’s expression was cold. He was now at the late Foundation Establishment stage. The difference between a single small realm was like that between heaven and earth, let alone a gap of two small realms.

To him, the other party was naturally an ant.

The other party’s reaction couldn't be called slow. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, his body twisted violently, attempting to transform into a gray shadow and flee into the shadows of the ruins.

But Xu Yunfan was even faster.

He pointed out a finger, soundlessly, yet a speck of condensed purple-gold lightning flickered at his fingertip.

His finger pointed toward the back of the gray shadow assassin’s head.

In an instant, that speck of ultra-condensed purple-gold lightning at his fingertip, like the core of a concentrated star, had yet to make full contact, but the lightning intent of the Divine霄 Nine Firmaments Mystic穹 Indestructible True Scripture, which could shatter all methods, had already pierced through the body, locking onto the core of Zimo True Lord’s soul.

“Spare…”

Terror in Zimo True Lord’s eyes almost turned into a physical substance. The word “life” had yet to leave his mouth when he felt an irresistible, immense suction force and an overbearing lightning intent that struck directly at the soul’s origin, descending simultaneously.

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to listen to his words.

This fellow had tried to sneak attack him, so he deserved to die.

The Zhou Tian Star Spirit Banner silently slid out from his sleeve. Its deep, dark surface was like ink splashed across the night, instantly expanding to a zhang in size, enveloping Zimo True Lord and the hastily summoned demonic shadows around him.

“Hum…”

The dark light of the Star Banner flashed once, and the struggling, twisting gray shadow, filled with horror, was like a clay ox entering the sea, completely swallowed. Only a wisp of green smoke and the faint demonic qi lingering in the air were left on the spot, which was then torn apart by the chaotic celestial qi currents.

“A mere Foundation Establishment early stage is just right to use your demonic soul to fill the star count.”

Xu Yunfan beckoned with his hand, and the Star Spirit Banner rolled up into a stream of light and vanished into his sleeve.

He couldn't help but snort.

Damn it, I was minding my own business and not provoking anyone, yet you came to provoke me first.

He sent his divine sense into the banner’s space to inspect it. He saw the newly added Zimo Star Soul floating among the countless stars. The consciousness that originally belonged to Zimo True Lord was trembling and twisting violently under the banner’s great power, letting out a silent wail. The soul origin imprinted on it was being assimilated and eroded by the banner’s power.

The individual will belonging to Zimo True Lord began to melt like ice and snow, quickly fading away. Under the edification of the Star Spirit Banner, only the outline of a Star Lord, containing pure Earthly Evil Shadow power, was left. It respectfully cupped its fists toward Xu Yunfan and then merged into the trajectory of the Zhou Tian stars.

“Qualitative change is ultimately brought about by quantitative change. Let’s fill the constellations first.”

Xu Yunfan felt no ripples in his heart about this outcome. A mere Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator really couldn't pique his interest.

Limited by the conditions, while pursuing high-quality banner spirits was important, in this battlefield ruin where the Heavenly Court has collapsed and heroes are in chaos, the accumulation of quantity was equally indispensable.

The Zhou Tian Star Banner he refined was specifically crafted to incorporate the Zhou Tian Star Dou Great Array. It needed all 365 Star Lords to be complete before it could display its true might, and perhaps it could借此 ascend to the Spirit Treasure realm.

Although Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivators were weak, when gathered into an array, they were still a considerable force.

In the days that followed, Xu Yunfan, relying on the Three-Layered Karma Secret Technique he had researched deeply, wove an invisible, formless, and fate-confusing secret net around himself, doing his best to twist and obscure his own aura traces and even some of his future karma threads.

At the same time, the Heaven’s Fate treasure bracelet he had personally refined on his wrist hummed slightly, emitting rings of even more profound light, further protecting his own fate, allowing him to move like a ghost in the gaps between light and shadow in the chaotic battlefield where true lords had no time to spare.

It was true that no one could detect him.

Xu Yunfan used the ruins of shattered palaces, collapsed mountain fissures, and surging energy turbulence as cover. His gaze was like a hawk’s, and his divine sense constantly transformed into waves of imperceptible breezes spreading out tens of thousands of miles, searching for suitable targets.

His goal was very clear.

The remaining Heavenly Court beings who called themselves true immortals but were actually on the same level as Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Taihua Lingxu World, and the scattered disciples of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

The notorious Foundation Establishment True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect who had no deep backing, or those belonging to other demonic branches, and occasionally, Arhat Golden Bodies of the Bodhi Pure Land who strayed into this war zone.

But Xu Yunfan had his own bottom line.

For those Core disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect, whose aura was pure and grand, clearly from the sect’s direct lineage, and who hadn't actively provoked him, he suppressed the fleeting thoughts in his heart and chose to slip past silently.

This wasn't being soft-hearted, but purely a rational judgment.

After all, if these direct disciples of the true lords died, the true lords might very well take action to investigate.

Once he faced a true lord head-on, the consequences were easy to foresee.

Most importantly, even if this world, which confused karma, captured these direct disciples into the Star Spirit Banner, once he used the Zhou Tian Star Banner against enemies outside, if it were filled with the sect’s well-known core disciples, all struggling like oxen as banner spirits…

Those lofty Golden Core True Lords, especially the heavyweights of the Jade Clear and Upper Clear branches within the sect, would recognize them at a glance.

By then, what awaited him wouldn't be a reward. A single slap that left him body and soul obliterated would be considered a light punishment.

A typical traitor.

The Primordial Origin Sect had seen such cases before. Refining fellow disciples was a common occurrence, but refining too many would make the true lords give you their apologies.

Xu Yunfan naturally became even more cautious.

This was no longer a problem that could be solved by being low-key. If he stirred up a nest of fellow disciples, that would be a true path to death.

Therefore, his hunting targets shifted more toward those Heavenly Court true immortals who were barely surviving and desperately hiding themselves in the ruins.

These beings, who once enjoyed the offerings of the Heavenly Court and possessed long lifespans, had long since lost their former dignity under the great calamity of the world’s collapse, panicking like dogs that had lost their homes.

Their cultivation level, under the Taihua Lingxu World system, was mostly at the Foundation Establishment early or mid-stage level. To Xu Yunfan, who had just advanced to the late Foundation Establishment stage, they were simply fat meat delivered to his mouth.

Xu Yunfan was naturally very happy.

Although, from the perspective of the Taihua Lingxu World’s hierarchy and his status as a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect, they were nothing but clay chickens and pottery dogs, no different from ants, and some were even inferior to loose cultivators of the Taihua Lingxu World, Xu Yunfan had to pinch his nose and take them in first.
