# Chapter 78: The Decisive Battle, Leaving Everyone Speechless

The elders fell silent, each seeing the shock reflected in the others' eyes.

The Clear Abyss Sect already had one troublemaker in Shang Wu—a先天Fighting Saint Body. That was headache enough.

If a second one appeared...

Hiss...

The elders instinctively leaned back in their seats.

The only consolation was that although Li Mo was formidable in combat, he usually had an excellent temper and was kind to others. He had only struck so heavily this time because the opponent had provoked him first.

"Old Xue, that child is your grand-disciple, isn't he?" Qian Bufan asked solemnly.

"Yes... Li Dalong was once my direct disciple," Xue Jing replied with complex emotions. "But he was injured later and applied to return to his hometown."

"Then you should visit Autumn Water Pavilion more often in the future."

"Indeed, the ideological education of disciples is particularly important."

The elders had already begun planning moral education classes for Li Mo.

"That's my disciple!" Shang Wu sniffed,哼ing. "A bunch of old geezers, just questioning my teaching skills."

The elders: "..."

His body refinement method and swordsmanship have nothing to do with you!

This is purely the boy's own heaven-defying talent, right?

Well...

To achieve such a level under Shang Wu's guidance only makes Li Mo seem like an even more uncut jade.

It was a pity that Li Mo's talent had baffled everyone back then.

Who would have thought that拜师Shang Wu might have been a blessing in disguise...

"He got Chixiao, so his swordsmanship must be impressive too."

"If his body refinement is also at that level... then he and little Bing'er might actually give us a real dragon-and-phoenix battle."

"Hahaha, our Clear Abyss Sect has a true phoenix, and now a hidden dragon is emerging."

Just based on the level Li Mo displayed on the arena.

At sixteen years old.

If you add his considerable swordsmanship, he absolutely belongs in the ranks of prodigies!

The elders looked at the representatives from various sects with ambiguous smiles.

You thought the Clear Abyss Sect was declining?

Wanted to test our sect's foundation?

Sweating now, aren't you?

"By the way, Old Qian, why don't you go up and call a stop to this?"

"Oh, I was just thinking that. Getting old, always forgetting things."

...

The match ended.

The result went without saying, and it was incredibly memorable—this was the first time in this Nine Peaks Tournament that someone had been carried off on a stretcher.

If Wang Hao hadn't still been twitching when they carried him off, everyone would have thought he was dead.

Many people looked at Ying Bing.

But the girl was still sipping her tea, looking unsurprised.

She had personally taught Li Mo swordsmanship, so she naturally knew.

For Li Mo's swordsmanship, body refinement was merely the icing on the cake.

Everyone thought about it and found it understandable.

The two lived together, so they must have some idea of each other's strength. It would be strange if they were surprised.

The only question was...

Who was stronger between them now?

...

The Nine Peaks Tournament continued.

But the subsequent matches were unremarkable.

Ying Bing's battles could basically be summarized as:

"I stand up, and it's over in one move."

However...某人didn't even need to use a combo.

In the semi-finals, Li Mo's opponent turned out to be someone he knew.

Xue Jing's disciple from the Alchemy Peak, the boy who had served Li Mo and Ying Bing at the clinic that day.

"Hehe, Li Shidi, we meet again."

The boy's smiling eyes held a hint of emotion. "When I saw you last time, you hadn't even opened your meridians yet, and I was already at the Jade Liquid Realm."

"Who would have thought that you'd now be standing opposite me."

His actual age was much older than his appearance, but due to an illness, he had remained in this form.

"Shixiong," Li Mo nodded slightly.

"Huh?"

"To stand opposite me, don't you need to get on the arena first?"

Looking at the boy who was still standing below the arena, Li Mo showed a helpless expression.

"Ah, I just remembered I have medicine brewing back at Alchemy Peak."

"I'll take my leave now, I won't disturb you."

The boy left in a hurry.

As he left, his gaze lingered between Ying Bing and Li Mo, and he gave Li Mo a thumbs-up.

"Go for it, Li Shidi. I'm rooting for you."

Li Mo: "?"

Well, he didn't need to move after all.

---

The final match.

Looking up, Ying Bing stood at the foot of the stage. Her light blue plain dress clung to her graceful figure, fluttering in the wind. In her deep pool-like eyes, emotions finally stirred.

She had never imagined before.

That the person standing opposite her in the Nine Peaks Tournament would be Li Mo.

This少年who had quickly disappeared into the crowd and become insignificant in her previous life.

In this life, he had毫不犹豫jumped down from Clear Abyss with her,毫不犹豫given her the Yuan Phoenix Soul Essence, and then revealed astonishing sword talent, almost rivaling Jiang Chulong.

Because of him, her life in this life had also changed in many ways.

Every day there were delicious meals, someone to discuss swordsmanship with, play Go with, and occasionally she could hear novel and interesting words from the少年's mouth.

This feeling...

Wasn't bad?

"Thanks to you, I've become much stronger."

"I won't go easy on you," Li Mo smiled.

The rewards he got from the ice lump naturally went without saying.

The daily耳濡目染also gave him the chance to realize his dream—becoming a handsome swordsman.

"No need to thank me, thank your own hard work," Ying Bing's delicate lips curved into an arc she hadn't even noticed herself. "Show me what you've achieved these past few days."

"I'll definitely give you a surprise," Li Mo's smile was sunny.

As a swordsman dueling with a master.

This feeling was awesome.

"If you've made great progress, I'll be happy for you too," Ying Bing said softly.

His sword was taught by her.

If he achieved results, she would naturally be pleased.

Win or lose wasn't important at all.

Audience: "?"

Elders: "?"

Hey, aren't you two going to fight?

When others get on stage, even if they don't curse or trash-talk, their manners are already excellent. And you two are here being happy for each other?

Should we just leave?

Fortunately.

The two said no more.

Li Mo gripped Chixiao tightly in his hand, his breathing lightened.

Ying Bing tied her black hair into a high ponytail with one hand, then nodded slightly.

The battle began.

Li Mo moved first. The tip of Chixiao trembled, and the sharp killing intent almost solidified.

Like a barrage of crane feathers, each possessing the sharpness to pierce metal and crack stone.

He hadn't wasted any time during this period.

To smoothly communicate between the two fated girls, he went to the library and found many books on sword techniques and principles to cram, pouring nearly half of his excess martial arts insights into them.

He had taken a big step on the path of technique approaching the Dao.

"Using killing intent to replace internal energy."

"Nice," Ying Bing praised softly.

The frosty sword light flashed. She didn't use internal energy.

Yet her agile sword flowers precisely dissolved the sharp killing intent layer by layer.

And she still had energy to spare.

The sword flowers dissipated the crane feathers and顺势counterattacked Li Mo.

The next second.

Li Mo's figure vanished from the spot.

Wind Shadow Step.

"Xunhua Sword Technique can be driven with the momentum of wind and rain."

"Merely dodging will only make my sword momentum stronger and stronger," Ying Bing's clear voice came.

Li Mo thought thoughtfully.

Both are perfected sword techniques, why is that?

Suddenly, he stopped thinking about Fire Crane Thousand Feathers and instead traced back to the source, thinking of the original "Prairie Fire Sword Technique."

Wildfire scorching the plains?

The audience below fell silent.

Are these two strong?

Very strong.

Whether Li Mo or Ying Bing, their swordsmanship had surpassed their imagination.

But...

Damn it.

Where is the tension of competing for the tournament championship?

Is this a fight?

This is clearly just sparring with each other!

Li Chuanzhen, where's the energy you had when you smashed Wang Hao into the ground?

Ying Chuanzhen, where's the invincible aura of finishing in one move upon meeting?

You weren't like this before!

Are you kidding me?!
