# Chapter 33: The Kingdom of Yinnan  

Faced with everyone's doubts, Jiang Li had no choice but to explain that it was due to the unique nature of his cultivation technique—a necessary measure.  

They all knew Jiang Li often practiced in the graveyard, so bringing a coffin along on this trip didn’t seem entirely unreasonable... right?  

After completing the necessary procedures, the group rented a spirit-horse-drawn carriage from the sect and set off.  

The Kingdom of Yinnan wasn’t too far from the Hidden Scripture Valley. Traveling day and night by carriage, they could reach it in just three days. After all, the sect wouldn’t send its disciples on missions to overly distant locations.  

Jiang Li and the others rode along a road carved out by someone long forgotten, speeding toward their destination. Along the way, they had to stop occasionally to rest and prepare meals.  

Yu Banxia and the others, having learned from their previous experience, knew exactly what precautions to take when camping outdoors. Not only did they have no shortage of food and drink, but Lu Qianqian, the petite girl among them, also had a beautiful singing voice. She would occasionally perform a tune or two, bringing much-needed joy to the otherwise monotonous journey.  

The Great Chongshan region, though just a small and relatively barren corner of one of the nine continents in this world, still felt vast and unimaginably expansive to Qi Refinement cultivators like Jiang Li, who couldn’t yet fly.  

To this day, Jiang Li still couldn’t recall exactly how many mortal kingdoms existed within the Great Chongshan region.  

The Kingdom of Yinnan was one of them. In terms of size and population, it was less than a third of Jiang Li’s homeland, the Kingdom of Hongyan. Moreover, it bordered a vast desert, its land arid and its population likely under ten million.  

The recent incident had reportedly affected a wide area, with over two thousand children falling into comas. This had finally pushed the King of Yinnan to take action, spending considerable resources to post a commission at the Hidden Scripture Valley.  

As they neared their destination, Jiang Li began to notice something unusual.  

The air grew increasingly dry, and the fertile black soil gradually gave way to barren yellow earth and sand, unsuitable for plant growth.  

It was early summer, a time when the trees and flowers along the road should have been lush and vibrant. Yet, at a glance, the forests and vegetation all appeared withered and sickly, with many leaves already tinged with the yellow hues of autumn.  

As a wood-attribute spiritual root cultivator, Jiang Li was naturally more sensitive to such changes than others.  

Consulting the sect-provided map, he saw that behind the Kingdom of Yinnan lay an immense desert—so vast its borders weren’t even marked.  

If desertification had worsened, causing the land to lose nutrients and moisture, this might explain the current state of the kingdom.  

But... Jiang Li glanced around. The trees stretched in unbroken stretches, and around the villages and towns of Yinnan, vast rice paddies had been cultivated. This didn’t seem like a land suffering from severe desertification.  

A sense of unease settled in his heart. He couldn’t shake the feeling that the mass coma incident might be connected to this strange phenomenon.  

Passing through the last stretch of dense forest, Jiang Li and the others leaned out of the carriage and finally caught sight of their destination—the Kingdom of Yinnan.  

**[Excessive consumption of Bright-Eye Pills enhances visual acuity.]**  
**[Enhanced Vision: Dynamic vision +200%, visual range +200%, night vision +50%, duration ∞]** (－)  

As a cultivator, Jiang Li’s senses were already sharp, and with the added effects of this buff, his eyesight was practically telescopic.  

While the others could barely make out the city walls, Jiang Li could already clearly see the farmers toiling in the fields outside the city and the listless soldiers idling by the gates.  

The capital of Yinnan wasn’t under lockdown. The soldiers and residents seemed entirely at ease, suggesting the kingdom hadn’t lied in its commission—there were no mass casualties or obvious enemies.  

However, as their carriage drew closer, Jiang Li noticed something else: not a single child was playing in the fields or streets.  

The spirit horses of the cultivation world were extraordinary, pulling a carriage the size of a small room—far larger than any ordinary wagon. Most striking of all, a pitch-black coffin was lashed to the roof with iron chains.  

As a result, every merchant and laborer they passed along the way stared at the carriage with strange expressions. But to them, anyone riding in such a carriage had to be nobility. None dared show disrespect.  

"Tch, these country bumpkins dare gawk at us? No sense of propriety, no reverence for immortals."  

Though they were merely Qi Refinement cultivators—the lowest tier in the cultivation world—in the eyes of mortals, they were no different from true immortals.  

Admittedly, saying it out loud was a bit embarrassing, but in mortal kingdoms, this was simply the truth.  

Whenever the Ascension Pavilion’s caravan arrived to test for spiritual roots, even the emperor of a kingdom would bow and scrape in attendance.  

"We’ll have to give them a little demonstration first."  

The carriage slowed to a stop before the city gates. Yu Banxia extended a hand from within, and a fireball began to grow in his palm, soon swelling to the size of a basketball.  

**[Blazing Flame Art]**  

Yu Banxia possessed a fire-attribute spiritual root, granting him formidable offensive power. This was the technique he had chosen alongside Jiang Li back then.  

After a few breaths, the fireball shot upward, transforming mid-flight into a lifelike flaming bird that circled once in the sky before vanishing with a *poof*.  

While Yu Banxia’s firebird technique might be impractical in actual combat, it was more than enough to awe onlookers.  

Especially in this unenlightened era, where even the crudest demonic tricks could make the common folk prostrate themselves in worship—let alone the spectacle of an immortal’s power.  

Instantly, everyone near the gates, young and old alike, dropped to their knees in reverence.  

"Immortals of the Hidden Scripture Valley have arrived! The King of Yinnan, come forth and pay your respects!"  

Amplified by spiritual energy, the booming voice echoed far and wide.  

After the proclamation, Jiang Li and the others urged the spirit horses forward. They were immortals—since when did immortals wait for mortals?  

The carriage moved leisurely down the straight main road, flanked by crowds of kneeling worshippers. Not a single person dared lift their head to look directly at it.  

Soon, another carriage came speeding from the direction of the palace. However, not daring to obstruct the immortals’ path, it stopped far ahead.  

A lavishly dressed middle-aged man, surrounded by attendants, hurried toward them.  

"Immortal Lords! Are you the Immortal Lords from the Hidden Scripture Valley? I am the King of Yinnan, here to welcome you!"  

The attendants knelt on either side of the road, not daring to speak. The king himself stepped forward and clasped his hands in an awkward salute—a gesture he clearly hadn’t used in a long time.
