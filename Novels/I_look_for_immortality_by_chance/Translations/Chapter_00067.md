# Chapter 67: Heavenly Vision and Peach Blossom Sword Seal!

Snowflakes fluttered down, and in the blink of an eye, over a month had passed.

Winter arrived. Outside the protective formation of Qingfeng Mountain Daoist Academy, white snow fell incessantly, and the waters of the great marsh turned bone-chillingly cold. Yet within the academy's formation, it remained as warm as spring.

Inside the Qian Yuan Cave, Gu Yuan washed his eyes with the last portion of spiritual liquid.

"Shua!"

The cold yet warm liquid flowed over his eyes, causing a tingling, itching sensation—as if something was about to emerge. This feeling had persisted for forty-eight days, but today it was exceptionally intense. Moreover, his eyeballs felt scorching hot, as if a surge of heat was about to burst forth.

After a while, this strange sensation gradually faded. His eyes returned to comfort, now cool and refreshed.

"This is…"

But the world before Gu Yuan's eyes had transformed. Strands of white mist densely filled the air, drifting slowly like a thick fog enveloping the entire cave.

"Spiritual energy?"

Spiritual energy permeated the world, yet it was invisible to the naked eye. Only when it reached a certain density would it manifest as spiritual mist. But now, in Gu Yuan's vision, spiritual energy appeared as droplets of rain, clear and distinct. Not only that, but peculiar trajectories also floated in the air, rising and falling, swaying left and right—these were the traces of the wind's passage.

Every trace left by living beings and objects now appeared in various strange hues before Gu Yuan's eyes. Furthermore, his gaze seemed capable of piercing through barriers and disguises, seeing directly into the essence of things.

Separated from the bamboo courtyard in front of Qian Yuan Cave by a cliff wall, when Gu Yuan focused his gaze, the wall turned transparent. His vision pierced straight through, revealing everything in the courtyard.

"Chirp!"

But that wasn't all. On the green bamboo in the courtyard, lively bluebirds flitted about, nibbling on bamboo leaves. Gu Yuan's gaze, still within the cave, settled on one of the birds.

"An ordinary bird, weak in vitality, half-sated, having eaten bamboo worms, with a hidden injury on its foot."

His eyes saw through the bird's internal organs, discerning all its conditions—even what it had eaten. Gu Yuan didn't use any magic power or seals; this was purely the power of his vision.

"Truly worthy of a spiritual eye that cost nearly seven hundred spirit stones. It's indeed extraordinary."

Gu Yuan withdrew his gaze and exhaled deeply.

---

He didn't know how to describe this sensation, but with the Heavenly Vision, he felt a profound sense of security—as if his very life had evolved, even if only in his eyes. Now, nothing could hide its true nature from him. Even if he couldn't fully discern the essence behind a disguise, he could sense something amiss and receive an inner warning.

Had he possessed this vision during his visit to Moon Bamboo Market, he would have detected the guide's fragrant approach the first time and wouldn't have fallen into the water ape's ambush.

"With this eye cultivated, I've gained a layer of protection."

Pleased, Gu Yuan tested his vision further before finally retracting his gaze. Then, beneath the Small Giant Divine Tree, he sat cross-legged and retrieved a jade slip.

"The Heavenly Vision is complete, but the Peach Blossom Sword Seal still needs work. I must finish it soon—storms are brewing…"

Over the past month, unlike before, Gu Yuan hadn't secluded himself in deep cultivation. Instead, he frequently traveled to Spirit Crane Island to complete spider-harvesting missions and collect spirit stones from behind the Water Curtain Grotto. Through these trips, he became acquainted with several disciples on the island and learned some news.

The Daoist Academy was preparing for another campaign.

Spirit Crane Island had already begun gathering spirit cranes—a clear sign of impending war. Gu Yuan wasn't surprised. The previous campaign against Cloud Cliff Shell Fields had been just the beginning. The Falling Cloud Sect and the Violet-Gold Six-Winged Eagles of Thunder Roar Mountain Range had been locked in battle for a full year, with heavy casualties on both sides. The eagles had already lost three spirit mountains, one medium-grade spirit mine, and a thousand-year herb garden.

By comparison, the academy's movements had been slow—giving disciples ample time to prepare. However, unlike the Falling Cloud Sect, whose conflict with the eagles stemmed from irreconcilable hatred and resource disputes, the academy's purpose was to temper its disciples, not merely expand territory. Thus, the pace was naturally slower.

But once the call to arms came, casualties were inevitable. Gu Yuan had to be fully prepared. Last time, for the sake of a golden opportunity, he had left his name on the Scarlet-Gold Jade Register. Once summoned, all names on the register would be prioritized for response.

Names on the Scarlet-Gold Jade Register weren't recorded lightly—they represented the choices of the academy's "Strike" and "Guard" factions. This was a military campaign against demonic beasts, akin to war. Once committed, withdrawal wasn't an option.

Gu Yuan wasn't keen on joining this campaign. With the spirit stones from the Golden-Back Ape, he could cultivate peacefully, likely even reaching the eighth level of Qi Refinement without resource shortages.

However, withdrawing from the conscription would be difficult. Without absolute certainty, he could only prepare for both possibilities—starting with mastering the Peach Blossom Sword Seal.

Time flew, and another half-month passed in the blink of an eye.

"Buzz!"

On the translucent spiritual wood, peach blossoms emerged one after another—hundreds of them cascading down in dazzling, enchanting splendor. Yet intertwined with them were radiant Daoist patterns, sharp as swords, exuding a fierce, murderous aura. A single glance was enough to inspire awe.

"Boom!"

The densely packed patterns connected in a perilous formation, ultimately coalescing into a vivid "peach blossom."

"Shua!"

Then, condensed semi-solidified magic power collided with the blossom.

"Clang!"

A sound like a bell—or perhaps the ring of a sword—resounded. The peach blossom transformed into a seal, its sword energy coalescing into a crimson magical imprint that landed in Gu Yuan's palm.

"Finally done!"

"Thankfully, I had the Small Giant Divine Seal to slightly enhance my comprehension. Otherwise, it might have taken another month to master this seal."

Beneath the Small Giant Divine Tree, Gu Yuan sighed in relief as he examined the completed seal. His towering, massive frame gradually shrank back to its original form.

The Peach Blossom Seal was the type he disliked most—not because it demanded resources, but because it heavily relied on comprehension. The materials required were minimal, costing only a few dozen spirit stones—just a five-hundred-year-old peach wood segment. But deciphering the sword patterns was excruciatingly difficult and obscure.

Even with the Small Giant Divine Seal enhancing his understanding daily, it still took nearly two months of painstaking effort to grasp the patterns and successfully condense the seal.

But at last, it was done.

And the academy's summoning bell and chime had yet to sound—there was still some time left.

Calculating the days, Gu Yuan mounted his flying shuttle and headed once more for Spirit Crane Island.
