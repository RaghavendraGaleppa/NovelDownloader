# Chapter 158: The Silk Scripture is Recognized

The Six Dao Ancestral Court was a land of wonders. Even the disciples from Beyond the Reach, with their extensive knowledge, found themselves exclaiming in admiration as they toured the area.

“How massive must its true body have been for its head to be so tall?” Ahead, a five-hundred-meter-tall skull stood, not eerie but crystal clear and luminous. From its seven orifices grew various spiritual vines and strange trees, exuding a rich medicinal fragrance.

“This is the famous Seven Aperture Miraculous Medicine. Even some elders in our Beyond the Reach Immortal Land are drooling over it. Ah, too bad, we can’t move it away.”

“Silence! Have you forgotten where this is? An Ancestral Court of a major sect!”

Behind them, Lu Zizai's dark hair subtly stirred and floated upwards upon hearing these words. He hadn’t even left yet, and his own backyard’s miraculous medicine was already being coveted by others. It was clear that the people from Beyond the Reach had been eyeing it for more than a day or two.

Qin Ming was also touring this cultivation ground meticulously for the first time, broadening his horizons. Unusual sights were everywhere. Even he almost drooled over the Seven Aperture Miraculous Medicine, but after seeing Lu Zizai’s expression, he immediately looked up at the clouds rolling and unrolling in the night sky, appearing completely unfazed by honor or disgrace.

“This small group of disciples from Beyond the Reach has a solid foundation; they are not simple. The Beyond the Reach Immortal Land truly endures,” Lu Zizai watched their departing backs. He had come personally, naturally, to gauge their strength. Through the qi flowing around these youths, it was as if he was looking at familiar old adversaries.

“Are they all very strong?” Qin Ming asked.

Lu Zizai replied, “To challenge the Six Dao Force, they are quite well-prepared. There are masters helping them refine parts of their spiritual consciousness, imbuing them with wisps of pure Yang energy.” He wasn't disparaging them but rather commenting objectively, believing that Beyond the Reach was experimenting with new methods and verifying new ideas.

“In the first two realms, core disciples of the Six Dao Ancestral Court at the same level aren’t afraid of this group. But once they reach the Spirit Field realm, the trouble will be significant,” Lu Zizai sighed. In fact, even during the Outer Saint stage, the cultivation speed of the New Path would suddenly slow down, and the gap would quickly widen.

Even while walking through the Six Dao Ancestral Court, the group of Beyond the Reach disciples remained extremely confident. This was because even the Immortal Combat Scripture, which could rival the Six Dao Heart Sutra, was merely considered a means of protecting their Dao, not their primary cultivation method.

Some old seniors from Beyond the Reach told them that their path was the Immortal Path, capable of looking down upon all other sects, instilling the strongest belief in all their disciples. Indeed, it was the same during the initial selection of disciples: those without spiritual aptitude could not enter Beyond the Reach, and those without divine wisdom could not join the Esoteric Sect. The ordinary people left behind could only rely on physical mutation, embarking on a difficult path.

“It’s truly not easy for a Dao lineage like the Six Dao to emerge on the New Path,” said a core disciple from the Immortal Land. “To be able to establish themselves in the Night Mist World, achieve worldwide fame, and even earn the approval of some old seniors from the Immortal Land, they are truly formidable.” They believed they were evaluating objectively, but in reality, they harbored a strong sense of psychological superiority. This was because they believed that during the disciple selection phase, they were already the victors, and only the ordinary people who were eliminated would embark on the New Path. In a sense, this was indeed the distinction between immortals and mortals in their eyes.

“The showdown is tomorrow. Are you few confident?” asked the white-clad girl, Luo Yao. Her eyebrows were curved, and her eyes were bright and lively, indicating she was not a quiet person by nature.

“Junior Sister Luo, rest assured, it’s not a big problem,” a yellow-robed youth replied. As he spoke, dazzling Heavenly Radiance Force emerged from his body, even coloring his hair with a golden glow.

The others also chimed in, well aware that the white-clad girl had a formidable background. The 'elder sister' she once followed held an extremely high status in the Immortal Land and, despite her young age, was already capable of contending forcefully with figures from the previous generation. As for Luo Yao herself, she was also exceptionally outstanding. When she reached the appropriate age to compete for core discipleship, she defeated numerous opponents and successfully entered on her first attempt.

“Thinking about it carefully, only in the first two realms can they contend with us. Once they reach the third realm, they’ll only be able to look at our backs from afar. I wonder why the elders want to test their methods this way?” someone questioned.

“Any path needs continuous refinement. This should be preparation for the Great Reclamation. Disciples in the first two realms need various means to protect their Dao.” Luo Yao, unlike her usual lively self, spoke seriously, “All of you, be earnest. Don’t end up suffering a crushing defeat; that would be truly shameful.”

Then, she looked at a purple-robed youth beside her and said, “Li Daocheng, you must hold the fort at the end. This is the first time a few old seniors are testing their methods, so you all must not bring shame upon them.”

The youth Li Daocheng nodded and said, “Senior Sister Luo, rest assured. The Immortal Combat Scripture I have comprehended is sufficient to rival the Six Dao Heart Sutra. Moreover, it seems to be naturally compatible with me, making me obsessed with it to the point where I almost delayed my cultivation on the Immortal Path.” He actually had a head of purple hair, and his face was calm and unruffled. Deep in his eyes, a faint purple mist flowed, a manifestation of reaching a certain level in cultivating the Immortal Combat Scripture. In fact, with every breath he took, wisps of purple mist would surge towards him from the world.

Luo Yao smiled faintly, “Mm, you were someone my elder sister commented on. You must perform well this time. When we return, I will lend you her cultivation notes to read.”

Afterward, they stopped discussing the matter and instead admired the wondrous sights.

Ahead, a fire willow soared into the night sky, its massive crown covering several square miles, resembling a mountain. Its drooping branches were crimson like rosy clouds, exceptionally beautiful.

Lu Zizai said, “Did you notice? The people from Beyond the Reach always maintain a psychological superiority when facing us.”

“Because we are ordinary people who rely on physical mutation,” Qin Ming nodded with a smile, already accustomed to it and feeling no ripples in his heart. In fact, when he first met the white-clad girl Luo Yao, although she held no ill will, she had laughed at his simplicity, saying that they were as far apart as mountains and seas.

After observing the youths, Lu Zizai stopped paying attention and turned to walk back.

Qin Ming asked, “Senior Brother Lu, for tomorrow’s showdown with them, as a disciple of the Six Dao, shouldn’t I demonstrate the Six Dao Force to them?” Initially, he hadn’t dared to bring it up, as he had already received much and wasn't so thick-skinned. Now, however, he believed it was more appropriate to educate his opponents with the Six Dao Ancestral Court’s signature martial art.

Lu Zizai replied, “The Six Dao Path has problems; you don’t need to cultivate it strictly. What I am doing now is forgetting past cultivation methods. I regard you as one of my own, and I don’t want you to follow the paths of predecessors. Every Ancestral Master forged their own path, carving out a new heaven and earth, and you should do the same.”

Qin Ming secretly sighed. The Silk Scripture he practiced was quite unconventional. For now, it seemed beneficial to have more cultivation methods, but he couldn't bring up this matter again. After all, he was also one of those who would soon be leaving.

Lu Zizai, with his back to him, stopped and said, “I suspect your path is similar to a certain special scripture in history, but everyone who tried it failed. Some died, some were crippled, and it even involved Ancestral Master-level figures.”

Qin Ming’s heart trembled violently at these words. He felt that what Lu Zizai mentioned sounded very much like the Silk Scripture.

Lu Zizai looked back and said, “If you truly embark on this path and can persevere to the end, come find me in the future!” He added, “In the early stages, if I were to give you the Six Dao Heart Sutra, which still has issues, I’m afraid you might explode. You should still proceed step by step.”

“Senior Brother Lu, what exactly is your identity?” Qin Ming couldn't help but ask, bringing up the old topic again.

Lu Zizai replied, “So eager to know? Alright, I’ll tell you before I leave, after you’ve dealt with the people from Beyond the Reach Immortal Land.”

In the evening, Qin Ming’s entire body glowed with golden light. Although he had comprehended the River Luo Scripture, the time was still short, and he had only cultivated a small amount of Heavenly Radiance Force; it was not yet a great accomplishment. Now, he had a solution.

In a moment, he used Metal generates Water to transform the Heavenly Radiance Force. Soon, the golden light turned into layers of water mist, engulfing him, with a rich vital energy flowing within. Then, he resumed transforming, continuously experimenting, swapping between the Five Elements, becoming increasingly skilled. Ultimately, he could transform attributes with a single thought.

The next day, a vast training ground in the Six Dao Ancestral Court was already packed with spectators. Everyone knew that the people from Beyond the Reach Immortal Land had come for a spar and exchange, intending to compete using the methods of the New Path, causing a huge stir. Many disciples of the Six Dao Ancestral Court held a suppressed anger, feeling offended. The opponent's win or loss might not matter if they used their weakness to attack the enemy's strength, but if they won, what face would the Six Dao lineage have left?

“The disciples on our side haven’t been practicing the New Path methods for a full five years yet,” an old man said with a chuckle.

“Hmm, the disciples appearing from our side have only embarked on the New Path for two years,” an elder of the Six Dao Ancestral Court calmly replied. In reality, he was merely repeating Lu Zizai’s subtle instructions, acting as a complete 'message relay station.' Yesterday, Lu Zizai had personally observed the disciples from Beyond the Reach Immortal Land and already knew their true capabilities.

At this moment, Qin Ming, clad in green, stood quietly in the center of the field, unrecognised by anyone. Lu Zizai was also afraid that he would perform too outstandingly and be remembered by some shameless old seniors from Beyond the Reach Immortal Land, just like the Hegemon of old, who eventually met a tragic end. However, Qin Ming’s realm was still low, so he wouldn’t catch the eye of those major figures for now. But if he were remembered every time, over time, he would certainly leave a deep impression.

Near the training ground, fiery springs flowed bubbling, and large silver trees swayed, all glowing and illuminating the area.

The people from Beyond the Reach Immortal Land sat on a raised platform, appearing relaxed, but in truth, they attached great importance to this matter. If the trial of their methods succeeded, several old seniors would continue to verify many astonishing ideas.

The ground paved with azure-gold stone was very hard. A youth from Beyond the Reach Immortal Land walked forward, clad in white, not a speck of dust on him. As he advanced, green leaves emerged one after another, followed by withered yellow leaves dancing and swirling around his body.

“It’s actually the Withering and Flourishing Scripture! How can he cultivate it to this extent at his age? The Heavenly Radiance Force isn’t just being released externally, but also transforming into specific phenomena?” Some Six Dao disciples’ expressions changed, greatly shaken by this.

“What are you panicking about? It’s merely the pure Yang spiritual consciousness carrying the Heavenly Radiance Force; everything is illusory,” an elder lightly reprimanded, urging them to quiet down. Despite his words, he too felt uneasy in his heart. The people from Beyond the Reach had, in effect, combined two paths, which was quite ominous.

The white-clad youth smiled. As he circulated the Withering and Flourishing Scripture, brilliant flower buds blossomed in the void, then swayed and flew towards Qin Ming. Even in combat, he exuded an air of transcendence, ethereal and remarkably unworldly.

Qin Ming stood there, directly plucking the flower with his fingers, a faint smile on his face. His ethereal charm clearly surpassed that of the youth opposite him.

Sweat beaded on the white-clad youth’s forehead. That flower carried his Heavenly Radiance Force and even the pure Yang spiritual consciousness refined by an elder. Originally, its power was immense, capable of instant detonation, yet now it was being appreciated as a “mundane flower” by his opponent. What kind of monster was this?

Next, he once again conjured a sacred flower bud, making it spin at high speed as it pressed down on his opponent.

Qin Ming still used the same hand to lightly pluck the flower, while his other hand remained clasped behind his back, appearing relaxed and carefree, like an immortal facing mortals. In the eyes of the people from Beyond the Reach Immortal Land, everything had been inverted.

With a whoosh, Qin Ming flicked his hand. The two flower buds flew back faster than they had come, blossoming as they went. Petals unfurled one by one, danced in the air, and then exploded with a roar!

The white-clad youth couldn't dodge at all. Covered by the sky-filling petals, his white robes burst open, cracks appeared on his body, and he coughed up mouthfuls of blood. He trembled violently, finally collapsing backward onto the ground, his blood staining the earth red.

“Is that all? Did you merely come to the Six Dao Ancestral Court to offer flowers?” Qin Ming asked, his hand still clasped behind his back.
