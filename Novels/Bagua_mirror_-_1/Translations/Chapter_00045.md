# Chapter 45: Dragon's Chant Grass

The Canglong Secret Realm wasn't particularly large in scope, but with flight restrictions in place, cultivators couldn't travel by sword flight. Relying solely on their legs made it impossible to explore the entire realm within three months.

Qin Chong and Zhao Yin chatted as they walked, soon entering a dense forest. Zhao Yin found a secluded spot where the two concealed themselves. On the first day, Zhao Yin didn't plan to take action but instead reviewed maps and details with Qin Chong to formulate a plan.

When Qin Chong saw the jade slip Zhao Yin produced, he couldn't help but curl his lip. "Old Zhao, you're too stingy. Couldn't you spare an extra two hundred spirit stones?"

"What do you know? Do you think I've spent decades in the cultivation world for nothing? Do you really think those extra materials could stump me?" Zhao Yin retorted.

At this, Qin Chong's eyes lit up. Seeing his expression, Zhao Yin quickly clutched the jade slip to his chest. "You little rascal, what mischief are you plotting now?"

"Old Zhao, don't be nervous. Now that we're teamed up, how could I scheme against you? But to complete our top-fifty mission successfully, we should share information. It benefits us both."

Zhao Yin's eyes darted craftily as he put on a sly expression. "You little fox, do you think I care about the materials you got by spending an extra two hundred spirit stones? Don't even think about it."

"Old Zhao, can we work together properly or not? We're in the same boat now—success or failure affects us both. Don't be so petty."

"Do you think I wanted to team up with you? You're the one who pestered me!" Zhao Yin grumbled.

"Enough talk. Hand over the jade slips. We'll review them and plan our next steps." Without waiting for Zhao Yin's consent, Qin Chong tossed his own jade slip over and snatched Zhao Yin's in one swift motion.

"Ugh, meeting you must be the worst luck of my eight lifetimes," Zhao Yin sighed.

"Cut the drama. Meeting me is the greatest fortune you'll ever have. You'll see." After exchanging a few more barbs, the two began carefully examining the maps and information in the jade slips.

The slip Qin Chong had taken from Zhao Yin wasn't the map purchased from Canglong Valley but another collection of information Zhao Yin had painstakingly gathered. However, after reading it, Qin Chong frowned. "Old Zhao, most of the spiritual materials in your notes are already in the 'Beginner's Spiritual Compendium.'"

"So what? My compendium is comprehensive. What's strange about that?" Zhao Yin retorted.

"And yet you guarded it like a treasure!"

"You're the one who snatched it from me, treating it like gold!"

"Ugh, whatever. Let's focus. Our priority is to cross-reference these materials with the map and plan a collection route. Time is short—we start tomorrow morning."

"Who knows what Canglong Valley was thinking, giving us a map and materials separately instead of combining them."

"Dream on. If everything was handed to you on a platter, would it still be called a trial?"

"Fair point. Let's get to work. I'll handle the left side of the map; you take the other. We need to finish quickly."

"You're the one who wasted time arguing!"

Early the next morning, Qin Chong and Zhao Yin hurried toward the nearest Dragon's Chant Mountain. By then, the other cultivators had already dispersed, and the secret realm's entrance had long since closed, not to reopen for another three months.

Though Dragon's Chant Mountain was closest to the entrance, most cultivators bypassed it to search for spiritual materials deeper in the realm, believing that the farther in they went, the greater the treasures. However, greater dangers also lurked in the depths.

Qin Chong, however, believed that success in this trial didn't necessarily depend on the quality of spiritual materials. The rarer the item, the scarcer it would be, whereas lower-grade materials would be more abundant. Since the final ranking was based on cumulative points, quantity could outweigh quality.

Dragon's Chant Grass, Purple Blood Ginseng, Crimson Vermilion Fruit, and over a dozen other spiritual herbs grew within Dragon's Chant Mountain, along with several valuable ores. With luck, they could reap a decent haul.

After a day's travel, they entered the mountain's vicinity, having already gathered some low-grade spiritual herbs along the way—minor gains, but better than nothing.

"Old Zhao, where should we go first?"

"Let's search for Dragon's Chant Grass first. It's the most valuable herb in these mountains."

"Agreed."

Zhao Yin, familiar with the terrain, led the way while Qin Chong followed closely. Within half an hour, they stopped at a shaded slope on one of the mountain's ridges.

"See there? About a dozen stalks of Dragon's Chant Grass." Following Zhao Yin's direction, Qin Chong spotted over ten plants growing on the slope ahead, with three exceeding a century in age.

Earlier, Zhao Yin had warned that powerful beasts might lurk nearby, so they refrained from using their spiritual senses recklessly to avoid alerting them. After carefully scouting the surroundings, they exchanged nods and crept forward.

Within moments, they reached the patch and began harvesting. 

"Leave the ones under thirty years," Zhao Yin instructed.

"Wow, Old Zhao, such consideration for Canglong Valley," Qin Chong teased, though he understood—harvesting immature herbs was shortsighted, even if these were the valley's resources.

"Fool! Those barely earn any points, and who knows if high-ranking cultivators are watching us right now?"

Qin Chong's heart sank. Were there surveillance arrays in the secret realm? 

"How do you know they're watching?"

"Think about it. It's their territory, their restrictions. Would they really let so many people in without safeguards?"

"Good point."

"Exactly. Anyone foolish enough to damage their resources would either be killed on the spot or expelled immediately."

Qin Chong realized partnering with Zhao Yin had been the right choice. Though he had lived two lives and considered himself experienced, in the cultivation world, he was still green compared to a veteran like Zhao Yin.

Harvesting required meticulous care to avoid damaging the plants, which would hasten the loss of spiritual energy. But just as they plucked the last stalk, trouble struck.

Two late-stage first-tier beasts had silently appeared nearby, their crimson eyes gleaming with killing intent.

"Azure-Scaled Horned Serpents!" 

"Don't panic," Zhao Yin said calmly. "They're good at hiding their presence, but their actual strength isn't overwhelming. We'll take one each and finish them quickly." His tone was almost reassuring.
