# Chapter 165: The Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique

The moment Xu Yunfan's boots touched the rammed-earth official road, he felt a numbness spread through his soles.

The ground pulsed with a muffled thunder-like vibration every five breaths. Three hundred feet below, twelve Mechanism Halls, combined with the Heavenly Artistry Department, operated玄钢钻山机 (Xuan Steel Mountain-Boring Machines) that gnawed through the bedrock.

Bare-chested laborers, like lines of worker ants, carried青光 (green-glowing)雷火岩 (Thunderfire Rock)药桶 (medicine barrels) into the tunnel. Each barrel was branded with the vermilion fire seal of "Made by Bingchen of the Melting Gold Hall." From a distance, they looked like a winding, red-scaled fire dragon burrowing into the earth.

"The earth dragon is turning over again!"

Someone shouted, and the entire wilderness suddenly fell into a dead silence.

Three breaths later, the ground in the southwest corner suddenly heaved up a mound, and the sound of gold and iron clashing pierced the sky.

Eight elite disciples of the Melting Gold Hall pulled an iron chain out of the ground. At the end of the chain was a spiral drill bit a zhang wide, its锋刃 (sharp edge) still粘着 (sticking to)炽红的岩浆 (scorching red magma).

Leading them was the Melting Gold Hall's true disciple, the first apprentice, Yan Yuwei. Her muscular body was brimming with strength. As she pulled the chain, her arms bulged with veins, and the force she exerted cracked the stone beneath her feet.

"Good, finally found a steel-refining ground not weaker than the Thunderfire Pool!"

Yan Yuwei was overjoyed. For their Melting Gold Hall's Melting Gold Forging Art, having a fire pool was crucial for accelerating cultivation efficiency. Now that a熔岩地 (magma ground) had been confirmed below the Ghost Cry Abyss, it was naturally a cause for celebration.

The shantytowns built along the moat stretched for over two li. Under straw-mat roofs, mechanical parts were piled high. Bare-chested men shouted work chants as they lifted thousand-jin gear assemblies. Women soaked drive belts in tung oil. Even young children carried bamboo baskets to distribute screws.

It was the slack season for farming. Under the lure of high wages, the surrounding villagers of Shu City had practically poured in with their entire families to work.

Most震撼 (shocking) was the temporary furnace area in the northeast. Thirty geothermal wells喷涌 (spewed)青紫色焰柱 (bluish-purple flame pillars). Apprentices操纵 (manipulated)铁链吊臂 (iron chain crane arms) like spider webs, sending red-hot steel beams into bottomless pits to cast the龙骨基座 (dragon bone foundation) of the Mechanism City.

Such a scene... Having been accustomed to the Xuanzhen Gate's philosophy of avoiding the extravagance of carved beams and painted pillars, favoring the natural atmosphere of "using the mountain's form as the bone and the clouds as its clothes," the two of them found the sight of this steel city truly eye-opening.

After a long while, Yu Jingshan retracted her gaze.

"It's a pity, it doesn't match my cultivation method. If I lived here for a long time, my cultivation would probably decline."

"Indeed."

Xu Yunfan glanced at the two of them without saying a word. He led them into the Heavenly Artistry City and handed them over to his Senior Brother, Fu Jin, to receive them. Upon hearing that they could have weapons custom-made, even Yu Jingshan couldn't help but show interest, surrounding Fu Jin with questions. Xu Yunfan found an excuse and slipped away.

When Xu Yunfan stepped down the精铁梯级 (fine iron stairs) to the three-hundred-zhang-deep underground, sulfur-tinged steam喷涌 (spewed) from the ventilation pipes, making his short clothes snap and flutter in the wind.

This place had been hastily excavated by the Melting Gold Hall using the Mechanism Hall's钻地兽 (burrowing beasts) to tap a magma ground. Yesterday, Xu Yunfan had even personally wielded a mining pick alongside the Melting Gold Hall's disciples to dig this洞 (cave), raising his Mining proficiency to just fourteen points short of the Great Achievement realm.

He couldn't help but secretly ponder that after today, he would go another day of digging with the Melting Gold Hall's first apprentice, Wan Shan, to push his Mining proficiency to Great Achievement.

The Melting Gold Hall's forging area at three hundred zhang deep was like the viscera of a giant beast. The青紫色焰柱 (bluish-purple flame pillars) spewing from the twelve geothermal wells cast熔岩般的纹路 (magma-like patterns) on the rock walls. Thirty-six ventilation pipes, thicker than a person, continuously extracted harmful gases from the underground while drawing in fresh air from the surface.

By the forging platform, Zhan Yan's bare upper body steamed with white mist. His knot-like back muscles rose and fell like waves with every swing of his hammer. Each strike on the red-hot steel blank sent out a meteor-like shower of iron sparks.

"Clang!"

When the final hammer fell, the steel blank actually emitted a dragon-like tremor.

Zhan Yan反手 (reversing his hand), he plunged the forging hammer into the quenching trough. Amidst the rising white mist, the outline of an八棱鎏金锤 (eight-faceted gold-plated hammer) gradually became clear.

The head of the hammer had patterns like layered蛟鳞 (flood dragon scales), and the end of the handle was嵌着 (inlaid with) three Xuan Steel barbs. It was the signature "破甲锤 (Armor-Breaking Hammer)" favored by the weapon-smithing artisans of the Heavenly Artistry Cave.

"You came at just the right time."

Zhan Yan wiped the iron ash from his forehead, his throat rolling with a muffled thunder-like laugh. "Take a look at this hammer. How does it compare to your Thunderfire Qilin Hammer?"

Xu Yunfan stepped forward and picked up the漆黑重锤 (pitch-black heavy hammer) that had not yet cooled. His fingertips stroked the hammer's surface, the touch feeling like caressing a living creature. A strange sensation permeated his skin, spreading heat.

The residual heat from the hammer body seeped through his skin into his meridians, actually causing his muscles to twitch involuntarily.

This was the "bloodlust" that only a top-tier weapon-smith could bestow upon a weapon.

It was a superior-grade sharp weapon, the best piece of weaponry Zhan Yan had crafted since the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.

He took a deep breath. The twenty-four vertebrae of his spine connected like a steel whip, and the muscles of his arms suddenly bulged. With one hand, he lifted the three-hundred-jin heavy hammer above his shoulder.

"It's a bit heavy."

He gave his wrist a shake, and the hammer head spun in his palm, leaving afterimages. "But the 'Coiling Dragon Pattern' on the handle can卸 (dissipate) thirty percent of the recoil, making it suitable for long battles... naturally, it is much inferior to the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer."

With his Heavenly Artistry Forging Technique cultivated to this point, he was in his best state and used the best materials, yet he could only forge a superior-grade common weapon. To break through to the sharp weapon grade, he would at least need his Heavenly Artistry Forging Technique to reach Small Achievement.

A sharp light flashed in Zhan Yan's eyes. His palm-sized hand suddenly pressed down on Xu Yunfan's shoulder.

He only heard the muscles at his own shoulder and neck emit a taut bowstring-like tremor.

The old sword-smith's thumb pressed down precisely. An incomparable force, like Mount Tai pressing down, layered down upon him.

Xu Yunfan's heels pressed down hard. The muscles on his body undulated like waves, and his bones trembled layer by layer. A faint, cicada-like sound emerged as he channeled the incoming force into the ground.

The cracks in the bricks and stones spread like a spider web but stopped abruptly at the threshold, as if an invisible knife had cut off the aftershock.

This press seemed casual, but it actually contained the layered force method of the "Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength." The青砖 (green bricks) beneath Xu Yunfan's feet shattered with a sound, yet his knees remained motionless. This was the "Iron Pile Taking Root" revealed when the External Three Unions were nearly at Small Achievement.

"The卸力 (force-dissipating) method of the Iron Pile Taking Root, yet you've trained it into a posture of splitting a river. The combined force of the three trainings of sinew, bone, and skin has初步 formed (initially formed), and the blood temperature nourishes like mercury flowing..."

Zhan Yan's voice carried an undisguised joy. Having just stepped into the External Three Unions, Xu Yunfan could already cultivate such a state, which naturally shocked him.

It had taken him at least three years to reach the level Xu Yunfan was at now, and his发劲 (force emission) wasn't as smooth and effortless, or as controllable at will, as Xu Yunfan's.

This single卸力 (force dissipation) showed that Xu Yunfan's control over his entire body's muscles had reached a microscopic level, flowing without obstruction.

The Three Trainings are perfect!

No one from the Divine Weapon Ridge back then had achieved this.

"Let's try it!"

He suddenly changed his palm into a claw, his thumb扣住 (hooking) the muscle knot on the inner side of his disciple's shoulder blade. "Back then, your grandmaster practiced his stance on the Yellow River shoals. The tide rose to his knees, yet his blue gown remained dry, all relying on this kind of截劲 (intercepting strength) skill."

A muffled groan escaped Xu Yunfan's throat, and his right arm suddenly bent back like a bow.
