# Chapter 129

At noon the next day.

A streak of rainbow light shot straight into the Thousand Techniques Pavilion. Before long, the same light reappeared, streaking toward the depths of Dragon Marsh Lake.

In the jade-green pavilion at the center of the immortal island, the spiritual light enveloping Zhang Jing gradually dissipated. His eyes flashed as he caught sight of Deer Thirty-Eight diligently cultivating in the distance. A satisfied nod followed—at least the deer wasn't slacking off.

Turning, Zhang Jing entered the cultivation chamber and settled onto a meditation cushion, his expression turning solemn. "All preparations are complete, and I've already informed the Pavilion Master. It's time to break through to Foundation Establishment."

Then he remembered Deer Thirty-Eight. The next moment, his voice roused the meditating deer from its cultivation. "Thirty-Eight, your master will be in closed-door cultivation for several years. You've been granted free access to the immortal island. Continue your diligent practice—I'll inspect your progress upon my emergence. Understood?"

Deer Thirty-Eight shrank its neck slightly before replying meekly, "Understood, Master."

"Excellent." Only then did Zhang Jing feel completely at ease. With a wave of his sleeve, the chamber door slammed shut as restrictive seals activated, isolating all external disturbances.

Closing his eyes, Zhang Jing began regulating his breathing to achieve optimal condition. Establishing one's Dao Foundation was no trivial matter—it demanded absolute focus and preparation.

Time passed indeterminably before Zhang Jing's eyes slowly reopened, his countenance now serene and detached. "Begin."

The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud manifested above him, its five-colored radiance swirling endlessly as profound mysteries emanated forth. The Foundation Establishment method from the Dragon-Subduing Void Absorption True Art and fragmentary insights about Foundation Establishment from the Primordial True World's legacy flashed through his mind.

The Dao Foundation exists in profound mystery—neither wholly present nor absent, residing within the Muddy Pellet Palace to commune with heavenly principles. "The Muddy Pellet Palace... three inches inward from the brow center," Zhang Jing realized.

His vast spiritual consciousness surged outward with intense fluctuations, gradually penetrating the exact center of his brow. Instantly, his awareness entered a mystical space filled with gray mist as unyielding as tempered steel, resisting every advance while rapidly depleting his spiritual energy.

The process proved excruciatingly difficult. Within mere breaths, fatigue already clouded Zhang Jing's eyes. This wasn't mere physical exertion—the Muddy Pellet Palace existed as if in a separate dimension, accessible only through this grueling method by some fundamental law of existence. Only after establishing the Dao Foundation would this anchor point eliminate future difficulties.

Time flowed imperceptibly until—BOOM!—a thunderous reverberation seemed to echo through his being as exhilarating clarity blossomed in his heart. Success!

Joy flashed across Zhang Jing's face as his oceanic spiritual consciousness flooded the previously dark Muddy Pellet Palace. Simultaneously, the Moonlight Dragon Python Dao Intent materialized—first as a savage lunar python that then exploded into countless interwoven chains of radiant divine patterns. "These are... the manifested Dao Principles and Law Patterns?" Zhang Jing intuitively understood.

The patterns varied in size. The most prominent carried the roaring essence of a flood dragon, while a slightly smaller one radiated boundless icy desolation—embodiments of the Flood Dragon Dao and Moonlight Dao respectively. As the patterns began intertwining, the Primordial True Intent suddenly manifested within the palace.

In that instant, an overwhelming aura of primordial chaos, world creation, and universal law propagation filled the space. The previously interwoven Dao Patterns instantly reformed into a cowering Moonlight Python that shrank into a corner, utterly subdued.

Meanwhile, as Zhang Jing devoted himself wholly to Foundation Establishment, a new visitor arrived at Dragon Marsh Market. Beneath the market's grand archway, Pei Xiaoshuang clutched a communication talisman while anxiously scanning her surroundings, her face a mix of excitement and nervousness.

Even now, she could scarcely believe that Senior Zhang Jing's promise from over two years ago was being fulfilled. Yet the solemn assurances from the unfamiliar cultivator who'd contacted her left no room for doubt. "Senior Zhang must have mobilized incredible connections for this," she mused.

Gathering courage, Pei Xiaoshuang mentally cheered herself: "Xiaoshuang, you must cultivate desperately in the Dao Academy! Don't disappoint Senior Zhang's efforts!"

Passing cultivators noticed the young woman beneath the archway, some suspecting she carried valuable treasures given her demeanor. Yet none dared entertain ill intentions—since the incident two years prior, the academy had tightened market security beyond any rogue cultivator's risk tolerance.

Soon a rainbow light descended before Pei Xiaoshuang, materializing into a blue-robed man. "Pei Xiaoshuang?" he inquired with a smile.

Bowing deeply, she replied, "This humble one is Pei Xiaoshuang, Honored Senior."

After verifying her identity, the man nodded. "Then come with me to the academy." Noticing her formality, he added, "You'll be an academy disciple now—address me as senior brother, and others likewise."

"Understood! Thank you for the guidance, Honored—" Catching herself, she corrected, "Thank you, Senior Brother!"

Pleased by her quick adjustment, the man summoned a flying vessel and escorted her toward the Inheritance Pavilion.

As they soared above the archipelago, Pei Xiaoshuang gasped at the breathtaking immortal realms below—jade islands adorned with magnificent structures stretching beyond sight. "So this is Dragon Lake Dao Academy..." she whispered in awe, her heart swelling at the thought of training in this sacred place with complete cultivation methods.

Remembering her benefactor, she hesitantly addressed her escort while fingering her storage pouch: "Senior Brother, you must know Senior Brother Zhang Jing well? Might I ask how he fares? I wish to express my gratitude in person."

In her mind, this senior brother's involvement in her admission surely indicated close ties to Zhang Jing—who better to inquire about her savior's whereabouts?
