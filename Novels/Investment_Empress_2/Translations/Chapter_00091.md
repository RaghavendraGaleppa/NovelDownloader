# Chapter 91: Golden Crow Blood, The Unfettered Trial Begins, Zuoqiu Yang (1/2)

A few days passed in the blink of an eye.

During this time, Li Mo’s daily routine was quite regular.

In the morning, he had his Master’s combat training. He still couldn’t withstand Shang Wu’s ‘Intent,’ but he could endure for longer and longer, even developing a kind of subconscious ‘sixth sense.’

This made his nightly Dual Cultivation increasingly proficient.

This was reflected in his control over his internal energy, ensuring he didn’t place too much of a burden on his Dual Cultivation partner, Bing Tuozi.

Li Mo discovered that the progress they made when practicing the *Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh* together was truly meteoric.

Originally, even if he could achieve the state of Heaven and Man as One, he still needed to continuously absorb the essence of Heaven and Earth to convert it into his own ‘Qi.’

But with Bing Tuozi, this process was more than ten times faster.

Heaven and Man as One, rare spiritual pills, his Master’s beatings, and Dual Cultivation with Bing Tuozi.

Wait... did something strange get mixed in there?

In any case, his speed in the Qi Condensation Realm could only be described as riding a rocket.

However, there was also bad news.

His initial estimation was wrong.

His Dantian’s capacity was too strong, with a meaning of ‘the sea accepting all rivers.’ He originally thought he could condense Qi into liquid in ten days or half a month, but now it seemed it would take a bit more effort.

Little Li wasn’t in a hurry.

After all, the process of cultivation was quite pleasant...

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully assisting Bing Tuozi in her cultivation.】

【Investment Feedback: One drop of Golden Crow Blood.】

【Golden Crow Blood】: “Birds are the essence of Yang, containing a trace of the Golden Crow’s solar power.”

Inside the World Seed.

Jiang Chulong held a branch in her left and right hands, the sound of her swinging them non-stop.

The Primordial Heavenly尊 (Celestial Venerable) flipped his palm and took out a crystal bottle.

Inside were a few drops of淡 golden liquid. Calling them liquid isn't quite accurate, because they don't merge, but burn separately, releasing a bean-sized, magnificent flame.

This was the harvest from Li Mo and Bing Tuozi’s Dual Cultivation over the past few days.

“Teacher... this little bean... it’s so warm.”

Jiang Chulong crouched down beside him, hugging her knees. The firelight flickered in the bottom of her eyes.

“This is Golden Crow Blood.”

The Heavenly尊 smiled lightly, as if this was just an ordinary object for him.

“Golden Crow? Teacher... you... even have something like this?”

Jiang Chulong opened her little mouth in surprise.

“You’ve seen this thing before?”

“I... I’ve seen something... a bit similar.”

Jiang Chulong stammered and recounted her experience.

She used to have no one to play with, so she would sometimes sneak out of the Cold Palace. Once, she snuck out quite far.

“There... there were many... little plaques...”

“And... the Founding Ancestor’s... statue...”

“There was a... three-legged crow... pecking at the Founding Ancestor...”

Li Mo figured out that she was talking about the Ancestral Hall.

After listening for a while, he roughly understood what the little princess had seen.

She had gone to the Ancestral Hall and saw a black three-legged bird pecking at the statue of the Founding Ancestor, Emperor Wu.

When the three-legged black bird was caught and killed, the blood that splashed out was a bit like the bottle of Golden Crow Blood in his hand.

“That shouldn’t be a true Golden Crow, but rather one with a trace of its bloodline.”

“A true Golden Crow is an existence that can transform into the Great Sun.”

Li Mo laughed.

Jiang Chulong nodded thoughtfully, then asked somewhat confusedly:

“But... but isn’t the Great Sun... Grandpa Emperor Wu?”

This question hit Little Li’s blind spot.

The historical records do clearly state that the Founding Ancestor, Emperor Wu, transformed his body into the Sun, but whether this is true or false, who can say for sure.

However, Little Princess Jiang didn’t dwell on this question for too long.

“Teacher, this... take... take it.”

Jiang Chulong took a sachet out from her bosom.

The material was actually quite good. Although there was no embroidery on it, it was sewn neatly.

She stammered, her fingers twisting together, not daring to look at her teacher’s expression.

“I... I made it myself.”

“You can do this?”

The Heavenly尊 was surprised.

“Y-yes... I learned it from a palace maid.”

“Where did you get the material?”

“I... I bought it.”

Seeing that her teacher seemed to like it, Jiang Chulong couldn’t help but sigh in relief, and her speech became a bit smoother:

“Lately, there are many things to pick up... knives, swords, and the like... in a fixed... place every day.”

“Hmm?”

The Heavenly尊 was puzzled.

You can find swords and knives on the street? Does this stuff auto-refresh?

But after Little Princess Jiang recounted her experiences over the past few days, he finally realized.

The Unfettered Trial had begun.

Every day, martial artists from the Jianghu were killing each other.

Some of them, who had a sense of martial honor, would find a scenic spot to duel.

Our Little Princess Jiang would quietly wait for them to finish fighting, then come out to clean up the battlefield.

She would also dig a pit to bury the loser, allowing the dead to rest in peace.

Li Mo: “.....”

Looting corpses?

He never would have imagined that Little Princess Jiang’s hobby of picking up trash would evolve...

“Is... is it not okay?”

“Safety comes first.”

Li Mo thought for a moment, and in the end, he taught her a martial art for concealing her aura.

“By the way, Teacher... when will Big Brother Li... be back?”

This was the question Jiang Chulong was eagerly waiting for, and she asked it every day when he left.

“Today.”

***

The Heavenly尊 gave a definite answer.

The sect needed to send disciples and elders down the mountain to prevent a great chaos in Ziyang Prefecture City.

He had long known that as one of the top few in the martial tournament, he would be stationed in the prefecture city. At that time, his Master would also follow. As an elder, she would naturally be in charge.

Speaking of which...

Shouldn’t it be about time?

Why hasn’t Master sent any news?

...

“Huh? Go to Ziyang Prefecture City?”

Facing his precious disciple’s inquiry.

Shang Wu, lying on a reclining chair, had a confused look in her almond-shaped eyes.

She took off her little gourd and took a few big gulps, then scratched her粉 cloud-like shoulder and remembered:

“There really is such a thing.”

“We were supposed to leave two days ago.”

Li Mo: “.....”

So you just forgot?

After making some inquiries, he found out.

Old Xiao had already set out ahead of time. He was probably already waiting at the agreed-upon location for two days.

So.

Li Mo, plus Bing Tuozi, pulled his Master along and got on the carriage down the mountain.

***

There was no sunset in the evening.

In a post station a hundred miles from Ziyang Prefecture City.

It was raining heavily today, pattering against the eaves. The弥漫 water vapor made the outside a vast white expanse.

Despite the torrential rain, the post station’s business was even better. The sound of people drinking and talking was incessant.

“Did I set out too early?”

“But I’ve been waiting for two days already...”

A figure wearing a bamboo hat, with a broken greatsword on his back, sat in a corner eating, occasionally glancing at the door.

After thinking about it, Xiao Qin felt it wasn’t his problem.

Over the past few days, quite a few incidents had occurred in the post station. Blood was often seen, people died, and it was incredibly tragic.

It was clear the Unfettered Trial had already begun.

“Hmph, the Unfettered Trial.”

At this moment, a aged voice sounded in his ear:

“I hate that bunch of infamous rats the most. They’re like dog-skin plasters, getting into every crack.”

“If I hadn’t been targeted by two Earthly Fiend assassins, I wouldn’t have had to...”

The Thousand-Form Martial Venerable obviously had no good feelings towards the Drizzle Pavilion.

“Teacher, what kind of existence is the Drizzle Pavilion?”

Xiao Qin couldn’t help but ask.

Even his teacher was forced to such a境地?

“In the Drizzle Pavilion, the highest are the Thirty-Six Heavenly Killers, who take direct orders from the Pavilion Master. Then there are the Seventy-Two Earthly Fiends, the Three Hundred and Sixty Butchers, and countless unranked assassins.”

“Heh, none of the guys causing a ruckus these past two days are qualified to enter the pavilion.”

“Those qualified to enter the Drizzle Pavilion wouldn’t be brutes who duel in broad daylight. They are vipers who are profit-driven and stop at nothing.”

“The Drizzle Pavilion is an existence that dares to assassinate even imperial relatives.”

“Give them money, and they’ll do your work.”

The Thousand-Form Martial Venerable had a deep impression of the Drizzle Pavilion.

Xiao Qin pondered and asked:

“Do their assassinations ever fail?”

“Failure just means you didn’t pay enough. They’ll tell you to add more money.”

“.....”

In a way, the Drizzle Pavilion was quite persistent.

Xiao Qin couldn’t help but develop a sense of keeping his distance from the Drizzle Pavilion, which valued money over people.

He was still more willing to deal with a gentleman like Brother Li...

At this moment.

A figure crashed through the rain curtain and stepped into the post station.

The originally noisy post station fell into a deathly silence.

The man was incredibly thin, with a short sword at his waist. He stood there, and the ground beneath him gradually turned red.

The liquid dripping from him wasn’t rainwater, but blood.

*Clang—*

Under the gaze of everyone, he walked straight over and sat down opposite Xiao Qin.

“Brother, is it alright if I sit here?”

As he spoke, he called the innkeeper for a bowl of beef noodles.

“Please, feel free.”

Xiao Qin’s expression was somber.

His Master said this man was no simple character...

“Sir, your beef noodles. As you requested, no scallions.”

The innkeeper ran over with a smile on his face.

The man narrowed his eyes but didn’t touch his chopsticks. He just grinned and said:

“But... I don’t eat beef.”

This sentence.

It broke the tense atmosphere of a storm brewing. The killing intent finally erupted.

*Whoosh—*

The innkeeper, who had just been smiling, flicked the towel on his shoulder, and a storm of cow-hair needles shot out from it.

Simultaneously, the sound of swords being drawn echoed throughout the post station.

“Zuoqiu Yang, today is your death day!”

The diners, the innkeeper, even the carriage drivers, all charged forward without exception, brimming with killing intent.

Xiao Qin: “?”

So the reason that man sat here was because...

Out of the entire post station, he was the only one who wasn’t an assassin?

It felt incredibly sudden and bald.
