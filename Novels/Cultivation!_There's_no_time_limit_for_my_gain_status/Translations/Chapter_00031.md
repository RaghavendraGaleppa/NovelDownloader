**Chapter 31: The Stone of Fate**  

Yu Banxia's breakthrough had been expected, but it still brought Jiang Li a sense of urgency.  

Yu Banxia’s spiritual root aptitude was likely very close to that of a top-grade spiritual root, though he wasn’t quite there yet. If even he could cultivate at such a speed, what about Qi Tianya, who possessed a genuine top-grade spiritual root? Or the other prodigies with even greater talent and more resources than Qi Tianya?  

How far had they progressed by now?  

Jiang Li couldn’t guess, but he imagined they must be formidable.  

With his system’s golden finger, he was certain he would grow stronger like a rolling snowball in the future. But right now, he was still weak—still in the early stages of accumulating his foundational capital. At this point, he couldn’t afford even the slightest slack or carelessness.  

At that moment, Yan Hong casually handed him a cloth pouch.  

"Jiang Li, as you asked, I personally went to the Ascension Pavilion."  

"What you wanted was hard to find, but I managed to get almost everything."  

"The total cost was 143 spirit stones. The remaining seven are in the pouch."  

Jiang Li took the pouch and peeked inside, his face lighting up with delight.  

"You’ve worked hard. You should’ve kept the extra spirit stones—no need to return them."  

He rummaged through the pouch and indeed found seven spirit stones tucked in the corner.  

"No need to be polite. I’ve already deducted the travel expenses and the cost of purchasing the mission items."  

"Besides, I’ve been wanting to visit the Ascension Pavilion again for a while. Their selection is far richer than what’s available within the sect—this trip was quite profitable for me too."  

"But Jiang Li," Yan Hong lowered his voice, "the alchemist at the Ascension Pavilion who took your order said your pill recipe is useless. If you ever commission him again, he’ll charge extra."  

Jiang Li scoffed. "These alchemists are so used to taking advantage that they throw a fit the moment they suffer even a slight loss. Next time, we’ll find someone else."  

In the world of cultivation, alchemy and artifact forging were highly sought-after professions.  

Aside from selling standard pills, alchemists occasionally took custom orders. In such cases, the price was usually negotiated between the parties.  

However, there was an unspoken rule in alchemy:  

If the client provided both the materials and the recipe—especially if the recipe was rare or entirely new—the alchemist would either waive the commission fee or charge very little.  

After all, the alchemist would naturally acquire the recipe after refining the pill, which was already a substantial reward in itself.  

Though Jiang Li dismissed it, he *had* indeed tricked the alchemist.  

The value of a useless pill recipe was... rather low.  

After parting ways with Yan Hong, Jiang Li hurried back to his room with the pouch.  

Inside were two bottles of pills, several stacks of talisman paper, and a crystal—preparations for his upcoming mission outside the sect.  

The "useless" recipe was, of course, the one he had copied from the Pill Creation Hall.  

Learning alchemy wasn’t easy. By the time he could refine pills himself, it might already be too late.  

So he had entrusted Yan Hong with the recipe and spirit stones, asking him to visit the Ascension Pavilion to purchase materials and commission an alchemist there to refine the pills.  

He had only considered the idea as a test, never expecting it to actually work.  

As for why he didn’t ask a sect alchemist... Well, they weren’t fools. If he ran into someone overly curious, things could get messy.  

The recipe he had chosen was meticulously selected for its powerful effects.  

With this, his upcoming mission would be much more secure.  

Then there was the crystal.  

Jiang Li had never seen one in person before, but the original owner of his body had.  

Holding it in his palm, it felt cool to the touch. After a moment, it emitted a faint, gentle glow.  

This was the **Stone of Fate**—a stone used to test whether someone had the fate to cultivate immortality.  

In other words, it tested for the presence of a spiritual root.  

The Ascension Pavilion’s caravans had once carried these stones to mortal kingdoms, testing young candidates before bringing them back.  

Jiang Li and others like him had stepped onto the path of cultivation precisely because of this.  

"I wonder how this Stone of Fate works."  

"Without such a miraculous tool, the scale of the cultivation world might shrink by more than tenfold."  

Jiang Li carried the stone to the window, where a small clay pot filled with moist soil sat on a table.  

Brushing aside the soil, he uncovered a seed buried shallowly within—unchanged in size or appearance since he had planted it months ago.  

"If you’re called the **Seed of Spiritual Roots**, let’s see if you really have any connection to spiritual roots."  

He took the seed from the pot and placed it beside the Stone of Fate on the table.  

One second. Two seconds. Three seconds passed.  

Then, a faint, misty glow emanated from the Stone of Fate.  

"It... it actually reacted!"  

Jiang Li was stunned. Could a seed truly possess a spiritual root? Or could this thing *grow* a spiritual root?  

What did a spiritual root even look like? Was it edible?  

He examined the seed closely but, as before, found nothing unusual.  

He had searched the "Comprehensive Guide to Spiritual Materials: Seeds Edition" in the Alchemy Hall multiple times but had yet to find a seed that matched its description.  

"This is strange. What should I do with you?"  

After some thought, he buried the seed again—this time placing two spirit stones alongside it.  

If it had a spiritual root, it should be able to absorb spiritual energy. Perhaps the spirit stones would have some effect.  

---  

Two days later, during a lecture at the Transmission Hall, Jiang Li saw Yu Banxia again.  

The young man was brimming with confidence, clearly pleased with his title as the top-ranked new disciple.  

"Yu Banxia, congratulations! It won’t be long before we’re calling you ‘Senior Brother’ of the inner sect, right?"  

Flattery was always welcome when a friend was riding high.  

Yu Banxia laughed. "Not at all. Cultivation only gets harder the further you go. Breaking through to the late Qi Refining stage is still a long way off. I won’t make it in time for this year’s outer sect competition."  

His implication was clear: reaching late Qi Refining was only a matter of time.  

The current outer sect seniors who had reached that stage had only done so through years of accumulation.  

Once *he* broke through, he would sweep the competition.  

His words were loud enough to draw sidelong glances.  

Several influential senior disciples frowned in displeasure.  

But the outer sect had its own rules: **First-year disciples were untouchable.**  

The sect had to ensure promising newcomers had time to develop. If the older disciples bullied them into submission, the sect’s future would be in jeopardy.
