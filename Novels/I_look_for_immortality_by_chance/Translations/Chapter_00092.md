**Chapter 92: Flowing Flame Golden Fruit and the Wealthy Chuyao**  

"Is the illusion in the Crossing Truth Star Formation based on the scenery of Yunlan Mountain?" Gu Yuan turned and asked.  

"Exactly. The six battles simulated in the Crossing Truth Star Formation all involve demonic beings from Yunlan Mountain. With your unparalleled skills, you broke through all six barriers, which means you can now enter the Yunlan Mountain valley directly!"  

"With your abilities and the Green Jade Token I gave you, you can freely plunder the secret realm. Isn’t that a generous gift?"  

Bian Chuyao smiled gently, her gaze filled with admiration as she looked at Gu Yuan.  

But Gu Yuan merely regarded her coolly, remaining silent.  

He knew she must have more to say.  

For a mere Mystic Grass, all this trouble couldn’t be without purpose.  

Since this matter was also related to the location of the Three Hearts Seal, Gu Yuan patiently listened.  

Seeing that her "smiling charm offensive" had no effect, Chuyao composed herself and spoke solemnly, "To be honest, Brother Gu, I’ve gone to such lengths to find the strongest fighter to accompany me to Yunlan Mountain to retrieve an item."  

"But don’t worry—I only want that one thing. Everything else in the secret realm can belong to you!"  

"Yunlan Mountain’s treasures are vast. When its sect fell, not everything was looted. Many things remain. Moreover, I’ve heard that some rogue cultivators have made it their hideout, storing secret manuals and techniques there. You’re sure to reap great rewards!"  

Yet Gu Yuan wasn’t interested in these promises. He simply asked, "What exactly are you seeking, Junior Sister?"  

Chuyao hesitated, but she knew that with someone as decisive as Gu Yuan, dishonesty would ruin any chance of cooperation.  

With a sigh, she admitted, "I need a 'Flowing Flame Golden Fruit.'"  

"Flowing Flame Golden Fruit?"  

Gu Yuan frowned.  

He had read about this fruit in the Scripture Pavilion. It was a rare spiritual fruit for Qi Refinement cultivators, capable of transforming a cultivator’s mana into a blazing golden flame, imbued with intense firepower. With this fruit, one could incinerate opponents of the same realm using just their mana.  

Ordinary Qi Refinement cultivators could manipulate their mana in countless ways, wielding immense force to move mountains and part seas, but they couldn’t generate flames without relying on spell seals.  

However, after consuming the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit, one could wield fiery techniques without needing spell seals.  

But while the fruit was extraordinary, it merely granted an additional fire-based ability. Why would Chuyao go to such lengths for it?  

---  

"Brother Gu, you may not know this, but I cultivate the 'Golden Sun Great Sun True Diagram,' one of the Seven True Diagrams of our sect. I’ve been meditating on it for over a decade and have no intention of switching to another method. To reach Foundation Establishment, I must absorb a fire-attribute Heaven and Earth Qi aligned with golden sun flames."  

"My family has already prepared the spiritual energy for my Foundation Establishment. But to ensure absolute success in refining this energy, I must first convert all my mana into blazing golden flames."  

"This step is crucial—only by completing it can I silence any doubts."  

"Yet fruits capable of transforming mana are exceedingly rare. After much searching, I’ve only found traces of a Flowing Flame Golden Fruit in Yunlan Mountain."  

"Since Yunlan Mountain has become a ruin, I urgently needed to find a powerful fighter to accompany me and retrieve this fruit."  

Chuyao’s eyes shimmered with a mix of sincerity and admiration as she softly pleaded, "Brother, with your unmatched skills, would you lend me your aid?"  

*The spiritual energy for Foundation Establishment is already prepared?*  

Gu Yuan had listened to much, but this was the line that struck him most.  

Truly, the privileges of a noble-born disciple were enviable.  

But why choose him?  

"Junior Sister comes from a prestigious clan, with countless experts at your disposal. Why choose an unknown like me?" Gu Yuan sighed.  

"Why belittle yourself, Brother?"  

Chuyao straightened, her gaze burning as if refusing to let him speak so lowly of himself.  

"Though you come from humble origins, in just a few years, you’ve reached the peak of the eighth layer of Qi Refinement. How could the spoiled scions of noble families compare to your talent and temperament?"  

"Moreover, as an inner disciple of our sect, you’ve been granted true techniques. How could you compare to mere servants or guards in my clan?"  

"My clan may have many cultivators and attendants, a grand entourage that seems luxurious, but how many among them can truly reach Foundation Establishment or attain the Great Dao? They merely enjoy the resources my ancestors have provided."  

"A cultivator’s power lies within themselves. You defeated all challengers in the Jade Hall. Unless I summon a Foundation Establishment elder from my clan, who among Qi Refinement cultivators dares claim they can surpass you?"  

"Only someone as talented, formidable, and decisive as you can truly help me. If not you, who else?"  

Gu Yuan couldn’t help but sigh inwardly.  

This woman knew how to flatter.  

Yet she spoke the truth. The glory of noble clans stemmed from their upper echelons, who provided abundant resources, allowing their disciples to surpass ordinary sect members in numbers, artifacts, and techniques.  

But few among them were truly exceptional.  

Gu Yuan cultivated true techniques, refined superior spell seals, and possessed top-tier spiritual sense—how could he be inferior to those noble elites?  

"Still, I must thank you for your kindness, Junior Sister. I have urgent matters to attend to and must take my leave."  

Yet Gu Yuan declined Chuyao’s offer.  

He flicked his sleeve, mounted his flying shuttle, and departed—though not too quickly.  

---  

"Ugh! So annoying, annoying, annoying!"  

"Little Miss, you begged him so sincerely, and he still refused! How rude! He really is a big bad guy!"  

"But it’s fine. That guy clearly isn’t trustworthy. If he went with you, he might even steal the fruit! It’s better not to go with him. We’ll find someone else!"  

"Yeah, yeah! Pah! So what if he has supreme spiritual sense? Without him, we can still enter the ruins!"  

The moment Gu Yuan left, several tiny figures emerged from Chuyao’s hair, shaking their fists and spitting in his direction.  

"Supreme spiritual sense… *is* extraordinary," Chuyao murmured softly.  

"Without it, one’s strength would be reduced by at least thirty percent against the demonic miasma of Yunlan Mountain, not to mention the risk of being bewitched. I never thought a commoner could possess such fortune—and with such formidable skills. For retrieving the Golden Fruit, he’s the best candidate..."  

"Ah, but we could choose from the seven main lineage disciples! They’re definitely stronger than that cold-faced jerk!"  

"Fool! The Flowing Flame Golden Fire is a supreme spiritual energy. Even Grandfather can’t arrange it directly. Little Miss must obtain the fruit in secret to become the undeniable candidate. Only then can Grandfather petition the sect to grant the energy. If the other seven lineages find out, they’ll fight like mad. Though Little Miss is peerless in talent, those seven-lineage disciples are no pushovers!"  

"Ah, then what do we do? That villain Gu already knows about this. Will he spread the word? Should we… quietly eliminate him?"  

One of the tiny spirits puffed out its cheeks, trying to look menacing—though its chubby face ruined the effect.  

Chuyao pinched its cheek and chuckled.  

"Don’t worry… he’s already agreed."  

"Huh? When? I didn’t hear anything!"  

"Someone like him is cautious yet bold. The moment he asked about Yunlan Mountain’s details, he was already interested—otherwise, he wouldn’t have engaged so deeply. The reason he refused and left is simply because my offer wasn’t high enough..."  

"But it’s fine. I, Bian Chuyao, have plenty of spirit stones to spare!"
