# Chapter 135: Defeating the Saint and Seizing the Demon Blade (Supplementary Update)

"The demonic transformations are still too limited." Zhang Jingxiu took a moment to glance skyward, sneering inwardly.

He knew that while the Greedwolf Saint appeared to have the upper hand, it couldn't sustain it for long.

Zhou Qing's sword light might seem overwhelmed, but his sword intent remained perfectly harmonious, showing little depletion. Instead, through continuous combat, he was analyzing the Greedwolf Saint's divine abilities, searching for weaknesses.

Zhang Jingxiu understood well that the longer Zhou Qing fought with his Insightful Eye and formidable divine sense, the more he could control the battlefield.

...

...

Mingri had absolute confidence in Zhou Qing, watching vigilantly from the side. Any foolish creature daring to interfere in the battle between the Tiger King and the White Wolf would face its frenzied attacks.

After joining forces with the Tiger King to dominate the beast tide, Mingri had grown increasingly self-assured. Its bloodline continued to awaken, naturally suppressing these dim-witted demonic beasts, while its Solar True Fire became ever more domineering and ruthless.

Though Zhou Qing's sword tides were being pushed back, the killing intent in his heart swelled.

As sword light crisscrossed the battlefield, Zhou Qing's divine sense and Insightful Eye operated at full capacity, making the rhythm of heaven and earth increasingly clear in his mind.

Man follows earth, earth follows heaven, heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows nature.

Zhou Qing understood clearly—two days of combat had elevated his comprehension of the "Dao" to a higher level than before.

Only through battle could a cultivator truly temper their understanding of the "Dao."

However, these insights couldn't be immediately converted into combat power; they required time to digest.

Zhou Qing wasn't in a hurry.

His demeanor grew increasingly relaxed.

The Greedwolf Saint's blade light intensified, darkening the sky once more under its demonic aura. The Greedwolf's intent sought to blot out the heavens.

Its attacks became heavier, its blade net denser, seemingly pushing Zhou Qing's sword tides into a corner.

Yet, in its eyes, Zhou Qing didn't appear oppressed by the overwhelming blade energy.

"Damnable human cultivator." The Greedwolf Saint felt a growing unease, sensing something amiss but unable to pinpoint it.

Unnoticed, the battlefield shifted.

They moved to distant waters.

Under the surging energy, the water erupted in towering waves.

The Greedwolf Saint's vision was obstructed, but with its demonic eyes and divine sense, it still locked onto Zhou Qing.

"Don't think of escaping. You won't get away," the Greedwolf Saint roared.

Man and demon clashed for another hundred li.

The vast water surface churned with towering curtains of spray.

Heaven darkened, sun and moon vanished.

The explosive roar of energy became the symphony of the world.

Then, suddenly, everything changed.

The erupting waves transformed into countless droplets, and under an extreme chill, the void itself crystallized into icy spikes.

...

...

Countless ice spikes shot toward the Greedwolf Saint like a storm.

Simultaneously, endless gales whipped the waters into frenzy.

Frost, clouds, and wind—each played its part under Zhou Qing's precise control.

Only Zhou Qing, with his formidable divine sense and terrifying mana, could execute such meticulous operations at the Foundation Establishment level, imbuing these ice spikes with devastating power.

"Pathetic tricks."

The ice spikes were indeed powerful, but against the White Moon Wolf Clan's Saint, they were far from enough. A powerful protective barrier deflected the spikes effortlessly. Meanwhile, the blade light grew even more explosive, suppressing the Green Bamboo Sword until it emitted a tearing screech.

Though the Green Bamboo Sword was already a top-grade magic artifact with some of the sharpness of Geng Metal, the Greedwolf Saint's Life-Severing Blade was crafted from the fangs of a deceased Core Formation demon, its material extraordinary—its hardness even comparable to a treasure artifact, though its power fell short.

Only when the Greedwolf Saint advanced to Core Formation could it elevate the blade to treasure artifact levels.

Even so, the Green Bamboo Sword's resilience was no match for it.

But the Green Bamboo Sword was astonishingly tenacious.

The ice spikes Zhou Qing unleashed were ultimately just minor distractions.

A hint of triumph flickered in the Greedwolf Saint's eyes.

Unnoticed, nine drops of water shot toward it.

It paid no heed, even subconsciously assuming Zhou Qing's ice spikes were exhausted—a sign of his waning strength.

By now, the Greedwolf Saint had to admit that even if Zhou Qing's power was declining, his endurance far exceeded expectations.

Its thoughts raced.

It prepared to let its protective barrier deflect the droplets while focusing entirely on shattering the Green Bamboo Sword to deal a crippling blow to Zhou Qing.

But soon, a chilling dread surged within it.

Those nine drops of water were far more terrifying than all the ice spikes combined—they pierced the Greedwolf Saint's protective barrier and struck precisely at the nodes where its demonic power gathered.

Instantly, the Greedwolf Saint's qi and blood reversed.

It couldn't fathom how its barrier had been breached by mere droplets.

Explosions of spells erupted around it.

Hundreds of talismans—ranging from various elemental spells to thunder talismans—detonated in a chaotic storm.

At this moment, Zhou Qing wasn't fighting alone.

Precious talismans from the storage pouches of Qin Qing, Xu You, the red-faced cultivator, and others were all unleashed in a single barrage.

With his overwhelming divine sense, Zhou Qing triggered their activation simultaneously.

Even his remaining thunder talismans were thrown into the mix.

...

...

As explosions rocked the battlefield, Zhou Qing submerged into the water.

He estimated this would at least help somewhat.

The key was the Lung Metal Thunder!

Moreover, if there was any surplus Geng Metal, combined with the Life-Severing Blade, it could be refined into the Green Bamboo Sword, potentially elevating it to a treasure artifact embryo.

Once Zhou Qing reached Core Formation, his True Fire could refine it into a true treasure artifact.

Of course, this would require engraving many more intricate and profound formation patterns.

Beyond that, he also sought a more powerful sword technique. The Green Bamboo Sword's quality wasn't an issue, nor was Zhou Qing's sword Dao comprehension—but his techniques were lacking.

Creating his own would be too time-consuming.

Finding a powerful sword technique, even if he didn't practice it directly, would be invaluable for reference.

Zhou Qing had already summoned Fu Shan to secretly guard the Desolate Ridge. By now, the beast tide had lost most of its threat.

After discussing with Jin Guang and the others, they soon headed for the waters.

Diving a thousand zhang underwater wasn't easy for ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators, but in this group, even the weakest—Fu Song—had a robust physique.

They descended steadily but didn't rush toward the cave abode.

Jin Guang produced an ancient mirror artifact to confirm the departure of the Emerald-Eyed Water Beast before they advanced.

Unbeknownst to them, Zhou Qing's Insightful Eye had already seen the beast leave.

Moreover, the outline of the cave's formation had appeared in his vision.

Heaven, earth, mountain, marsh, water, fire, wind, thunder—eight types of qi circulated within.

"The Eight Trigrams Immortal Thunder Formation!" The name surfaced in Zhou Qing's mind—an ancient formation Yuan Mingyue had once mentioned.

In past beast tides, the potential threat of Core Formation demons might have forced tighter unity. But this time, with no Core Formation demons appearing, self-preservation took precedence. If companions were in danger, no one would recklessly intervene without confidence.

After all, Tianxuan City was primarily composed of loose cultivators, some even temporary arrivals from the wilds.

Zhou Qing's group, however, operated as a sect.

He understood that this was because Tianxuan Ancestor, himself a loose cultivator, treated Tianxuan City as a loose alliance rather than forging it into a tightly-knit sect.

Tianxuan Ancestor didn't want to waste effort.

Because his combat power alone was Tianxuan City's foundation—everything else was secondary.

When Zhou Qing reappeared in the Desolate Ridge market, whether it was Luo Xiangu or the loose cultivators who had joined, they all looked at him as if beholding a deity.

In their eyes, Senior Qinglingzi was already the Tianxuan Ancestor before his Core Formation.

Or perhaps even stronger than the Tianxuan Ancestor of old.

Unrivaled beneath Core Formation—whether among human cultivators or demonic saints...

The White Moon Wolf Saint's Life-Severing Blade now hung at Zhou Qing's side.

Such a feat was dazzling beyond compare.

Zhou Qing was now utterly certain—within Foundation Establishment, he was invincible.

The third, fourth, and fifth days of the beast tide passed effortlessly under Zhou Qing's defense. For Tianxuan City, the fifth day was the climax.

For Zhou Qing, the second day had been the peak.

Though he hadn't appeared in Tianxuan City, the Greedwolf Saint—the strongest among the beasts—had been severely wounded by him, significantly reducing the city's pressure.

After five days of slaughter, Tianxuan City's cohesion had improved somewhat.

On the sixth day of the beast tide, Jin Guang, Crane Immortal, Ye Chong, and another late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator arrived at Desolate Ridge. Aside from Jin Guang, even Crane Immortal regarded Zhou Qing with visible awe.

"Fellow Daoist Jin Guang, please, everyone, take a seat."

Zhou Qing sat imposingly in the host's seat, the Greedwolf Saint's Life-Severing Blade resting beside him.

The pale-white demonic fang blade exuded an unsettling aura.

Jin Guang spoke first: "Fellow Daoist Qingling, your fame has now spread throughout Tianxuan City and the four demonic sects. 'First Under Core Formation' is no exaggeration."

Zhou Qing smiled faintly. "You flatter me, Fellow Daoist Jin. Without reaching Core Formation, no matter how strong one is in Foundation Establishment, it's ultimately meaningless." In truth, had it not been for the Jade Marrow Reversion Pill and the partial refinement of Geng Metal, Zhou Qing's current strength would have been slightly inferior to the Greedwolf Saint's.

And both the Jade Marrow Reversion Pill and Geng Metal had come from Jin Guang's assistance.

Naturally, his impression of Jin Guang was quite favorable now.

Even so, Zhou Qing couldn't fully trust Jin Guang, though he remained courteous in their exchanges.

"Your Core Formation is inevitable, whereas we must still struggle bitterly."

Zhou Qing waved it off. "Let's not dwell on that. Until Core Formation is achieved, such talk is meaningless. How far is the cave abode guarded by the Emerald-Eyed Water Beast from here?"

"Not too far—just a few hundred li, though it's a thousand zhang underwater."

Zhou Qing recalled a particularly deep area about a hundred li from the water mansion—a place his instincts had warned him against exploring. It seemed Jin Guang's cave abode was located there.

Jin Guang and the others had naturally obtained Shang Zijian's approval to come, as the beast tide's danger had diminished by this stage.

Their departure also gave other cultivators more opportunities to distinguish themselves.

Accumulated contributions during the beast tide determined the rewards.

With Jin Guang and Crane Immortal—both peak Foundation Establishment cultivators—along with Ye Chong and another late-stage Foundation Establishment expert, plus Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song, the underwater cave abode was worth exploring despite its dangers.

Even if the Emerald-Eyed Water Beast returned, they could handle it.

Jin Guang had already confirmed that the beast would leave the cave on the seventh day.

The danger Zhou Qing sensed likely stemmed partly from the Emerald-Eyed Water Beast—an ancient remnant species that thrived effortlessly a thousand zhang underwater.

After discussing the matter with Jin Guang and the others, Zhou Qing asked, "Do you know why the Emerald-Eyed Water Beast leaves its cave on the seventh day of the beast tide?"

Jin Guang nodded. "I've investigated this. The beast particularly enjoys a peculiar fish called the Snow Trout. Every seventh day of the beast tide, these fish emerge from a whirlpool abyss a few hundred li from the cave."

"A whirlpool abyss?" Zhou Qing remembered markings for such a location on the underwater maps he'd collected—a notoriously dangerous place from which no one had ever escaped after being sucked in.

That the abyss would expel strange Snow Trout during the beast tide defied explanation.

Zhou Qing suspected there was a secret behind it.

Perhaps a secret realm lay beyond the abyss.

But if he could guess this, so could others. That no one had unraveled the abyss's mysteries suggested extreme danger.

For now, Zhou Qing focused on the ancient cave abode Jin Guang mentioned. He hoped to find Geng Metal there to accelerate his Lung Metal Thunder cultivation before tackling the final Spleen Earth Thunder.

As for the Earth Armored Dragon they'd captured—might it aid his Spleen Earth Thunder training?

Zhou Qing guessed it would help somewhat.

But the key remained the Lung Metal Thunder!

And if there was surplus Geng Metal, combined with the Life-Severing Blade to refine into the Green Bamboo Sword, the sword might become a treasure artifact embryo.

Once Zhou Qing reached Core Formation, his True Fire could elevate it to a true treasure artifact.

Of course, this would require engraving far more intricate formation patterns.

Beyond that, he wanted a more powerful sword technique. The Green Bamboo Sword's quality wasn't an issue, nor was Zhou Qing's sword Dao comprehension—but his techniques were lacking.

Creating his own would be too time-consuming.

Obtaining a powerful sword technique, even just for reference, would be invaluable.
