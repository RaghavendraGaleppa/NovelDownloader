Chapter 252: A Moment to Test Innate Talent

The Immortal Seed from the Pure Land, Sun Jingxiao, saw Qin Ming, Xiang Yiwu, and others approaching. A smile played on his lips. "This is a technique of the Immortal Path, unrelated to the disciples of the Newcomer's Path." He didn't say much more, expecting to see who would look utterly bewildered and embarrassed later.

A book made from immortal skin was a rare sight in this era; no one could bear such extravagance. For a time, a long queue formed of those wishing to lay their hands on this book.

Qin Ming waited and waited, not wanting to waste time, thinking it wouldn't hurt to study the scripture later when there were fewer people. He prepared to go catch up with Li Qingyue; earlier, she had always been surrounded by people, but now there were finally fewer.

"You're really... that young man from Black and White Mountain?" The white-clad maiden Luo Yao approached. On her pretty face, which had a hint of baby fat, her delicate brows curved, and her large eyes sparkled. Without a doubt, she was usually lively and talkative.

"Is it really the person I saw back then? Unimaginable!" Before Qin Ming could say anything, she started conjuring all sorts of scenarios in her mind.

"That Black and White Mountain used to be terrifying, and it's still very strange now. Could it be that it's revived? And a young prodigy has emerged from there..."

"What are you mumbling about?" Qin Ming asked her.

"Ah? Nothing, I just feel that one's destiny is unpredictable," she said earnestly. Back then, in her eyes, he was just a young hunter from a remote area. She truly hadn't expected him to change so much, now capable of defeating Immortal Seeds of the Second Realm.

Qin Ming smiled, "I remember now, aren't you that chubby girl who was like mountains and seas away from me?"

The white-clad maiden's face instantly darkened. Who's chubby?! She was merely bursting with vitality, with a hint of baby fat, not chubby at all. On normal days, who wouldn't call her a fairy? Yet, in this young man's mouth, she was nothing of the sort!

"It really is you, you petty person, you actually hold a grudge!" She stared at the former hunter youth, who actually remembered what she had said.

"Chubby girl, what realm are you in now?" Qin Ming asked with an amiable smile.

Luo Yao desperately wanted to hit him, but considering his strength, she had to resign herself. The boomerang she threw back then had landed squarely on herself.

Qin Ming said, "Hmm, you're only at the early stage of the Second Realm. You still need to work hard. You're not qualified to be an Immortal Seed until you reach the middle stage, and there's quite a gap between you and your sister."

The white-clad maiden was first depressed, then her eyes sparkled again, and she said, "My sister is like a reincarnated Celestial Fairy; no one can compare to her."

Qin Ming pursed his lips, no longer wanting to tease her, and turned to leave.

The white-clad maiden said, "I admit I said the wrong thing and misjudged you back then. However, the distance between you and my sister is indeed... still very far."

Qin Ming didn't refute. The woman in green truly was astonishing. Back then, she was able to seize the greatest fortune from the new master of Black and White Mountain, the White-Haired Old Beast, the Old Weasel, and the former Crimson Cloud City Lord Ling Xu, which was proof enough.

"What did your sister take from Black and White Mountain back then?" Qin Ming asked casually.

The white-clad maiden giggled; naturally, she wouldn't utter a single word about this matter.

Qin Ming turned and left, not wanting to waste time.

"Hey, don't go, let's chat," Luo Yao called out.

Qin Ming glanced at her. "What's there to chat about with you? I still need to study scriptures."

The white-clad maiden was thoroughly exasperated. This guy really couldn't talk properly, completely unreserved, simply odious and stubborn. She couldn't help but say, "That's a scripture of the Immortal Path. What are you, a newcomer, meddling with?"

Qin Ming stopped and looked back. "You Immortal Lands have the 'Immortal Combat Scripture', right? Have you seen it?"

He was very much thinking about the "Eight Sceneries Divine Illumination Scripture." Now that he had planned his path, the most lacking component was the thunder-fire needed for the Dragon-Tiger Concoction.

"I've seen it. What about it?" Luo Yao asked.

Qin Ming instantly became enthusiastic, a wide smile on his face. "Fairy Luo, how about we exchange scriptures? I'd like to trade for your Immortal Combat Scripture."

Luo Yao's eyes widened. This young man didn't even put her in his eyes. Did he really think she was a pure, innocent, and sweet naive girl? He just opened his mouth and tried to trick her out of a legendary scripture!

Qin Ming said, "Don't stare. I guarantee you won't lose out. I'll study the principles recorded on the immortal skin and exchange them with you equally."

Luo Yao immediately curled her lip. "Hmph, you're just a young disciple of the Newcomer's Path. What are you thinking, trying to comprehend the scriptures of a divine immortal's dojo..."

Qin Ming bluntly interrupted her. "Stop the nonsense. I'll just ask one thing: if I can comprehend it, will you trade?"

Luo Yao's temper flared too. "Trade! But can you? It's simply impossible!"

Qin Ming looked at her. "Hold on, don't boast yet. Can you even make that decision? Are you qualified to trade scriptures with me?"

The white-clad maiden felt a pang in her chest. Who was boasting now? How did it turn into him questioning her? However, after careful consideration, she truly didn't dare to reveal the entire "Immortal Combat Scripture."

She spoke, "What I can exchange is only the 'Eight Sceneries Scripture,' which is at the level of a wondrous technique."

Qin Ming's heart stirred. So, the so-called "Immortal Combat Scripture" was indeed pieced together!

"Is the wondrous technique you're talking about the 'Eight Sceneries Divine Illumination Scripture'?"

"No, the 'Eight Sceneries Divine Illumination Scripture' is already a secret canon-level text. The 'Eight Sceneries Scripture' is a wondrous technique."

Qin Ming pondered. Currently, he couldn't cultivate a secret canon-level text even if he had one. At present, he was still at the level of practicing wondrous techniques, so having the "Eight Sceneries Scripture" would be sufficient.

"Alright, at that time, I'll transcribe parts of the principles and exchange them with you equally," Qin Ming said.

The white-clad maiden felt speechless. What kind of person was this? Did he really think his innate talent was unparalleled, and he could comprehend any scripture? Even her sister wouldn't be so confident!

Seeing him about to leave again, she remembered the important matter. She stepped forward mysteriously and whispered, "Are you related to the strange occurrences at Black and White Mountain?"

"You wanted to chat just for this?" Qin Ming showed her the back of his head and walked away directly.

He suddenly noticed the Purple Lightning Beast stealthily approaching, like a thief. Moreover, he noticed the small purple hammer hidden in her sleeve. Could it be that she wanted to ambush him and give him a sudden, fierce blow? In the past, Qin Ming had personally witnessed her use this hammer to shatter the seven-colored vase Cao Qianqiu gifted Li Qingxu in the Great Centipede's divine city.

The purple-haired maiden smiled sweetly at him, feigning a chance encounter.

Qin Ming grinned. Since the other party wanted to put on an an act, he would play along too. They'd see about it later.

Just then, Li Qingyue walked towards him. Her white clothes were purer than snow, her beautiful hair dark and lustrous, her eyes bright and clear. As her sleeves fluttered, her entire being was exceptionally ethereal, as serene as an immortal.

"You're truly popular," she said with a smile, showing no sense of distance after becoming near-immortal. She was still very close, speaking her mind as she always did.

Qin Ming said, "How so? Just now, you were surrounded by people; I couldn't even squeeze through."

Then, he lowered his voice and said, "Do you know? Grandpa Li even wanted to marry you off. He was mainly worried you'd disappear like a kite swallowed by the night sky, but I helped you block it."

Li Qingyue froze for a moment, then tilted her head to look at him, before breaking into a smile that made one feel as if basking in a spring breeze.

Qin Ming said, "Let's go. We'll work together to decipher that scripture."

"Alright!" Li Qingyue was quite confident.

At this point, someone had already used a memory crystal to duplicate the scripture on the immortal skin, so there was no longer a need for a long queue. Of course, Chu Pianran had only revealed twelve pages; the scriptures after that were locked by mysterious patterns.

Soon after, Qin Ming and Li Qingyue stepped forward, also preparing to copy a section.

"Fairy Li, Brother Qin, you can directly view the main text!" Chu Pianran transmitted her voice, regarding the two with special favor. In fact, famous Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds like Cui Chonghe, Su Shiyun, and Zhao Yaoting all received this treatment.

Chu Pianran brought the scripture not to make things difficult for anyone, but genuinely wished for future generations to analyze it. Regarding the ancient text on the immortal skin, she herself had only managed to study twelve pages; beyond that, she truly couldn't comprehend it.

At this moment, some Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds were frowning deeply, unable to comprehend the text. This ancient scripture was too abstruse, leaving people utterly clueless.

Nearby, someone muttered, "The people from the Newcomer's Path actually came forward. This isn't their technique, nor their path at all. Their courage is commendable."

Ironically, Sun Jingxiao, who had first said such things, remained silent because he himself looked utterly bewildered, having comprehended nothing so far.

Qin Ming held the immortal skin, his heart in an internal struggle. He really wanted to resonate with it and record the entire scripture. However, he didn't dare to do so. He knew very well that these were extraordinary principles, likely involving near-immortal beings. He would not forget the terrifying experiences he had when resonating with the Bagua Furnace scripture and the scripture on the golden scales left by the Great Centipede. His comprehension then had been intermittent, and his head had almost been turned into mush by the impact.

Qin Ming sighed inwardly. For now, it was safer to be conventional and not take risks here. There was a group of patriarchs in Kunling City; if anyone was monitoring this place, it would be even more dangerous.

In the end, Qin Ming merely observed the scripture, then closed his eyes to meditate and comprehend.

Runes were interwoven on the immortal skin, preventing it from decaying even after thousands of years. This scripture contained no words; instead, it was filled with lifelike small figures, each with dense, intertwining black and white lines within their bodies.

Qin Ming's heart stirred. This style bore a slight resemblance to the "Fate Altering Scripture." He quietly pondered and carefully studied it. This scripture was indeed very difficult, even forcing him to slightly furrow his brow. The main challenge was that each of the twelve pages contained many small figures, and each figure had complex black and white lines. If each human figure represented a cultivation route, then having so many superimposed together made it truly difficult for the comprehending individual.

Qin Ming tried it. If each illustration was operated according to the black and white lines, there weren't many problems; what was initially sluggish became smooth. His Heavenly Light flowed along the routes, as if opening up a path in a world of night mist, and streaks of light illuminated within his body, like rivers formed by fire springs surging.

Seen this way, it was indeed similar to the "Fate Altering Scripture"! However, it was definitely not the latter; it contained specific techniques and methods.

Qin Ming's heart moved. He knew his own situation: his Heavenly Light energy also contained conscious spiritual light and divine wisdom. He tried activating it solely with Heavenly Light or divine wisdom, and indeed, the difficulty instantly skyrocketed. He understood then that, viewed this way, this scripture was no longer very difficult for him.

Afterwards, every now and then, he would look at the original immortal skin scripture. Mainly because there were too many cultivation routes, he feared oversight and errors, so he repeatedly compared them until he was certain there were no issues.

Many people were speechless. "As a newcomer, do you really need to put in so much effort? Theoretically, one cannot cultivate the scriptures of a divine immortal's dojo at all."

More than two hours passed; it was already late into the night, but everyone was still studying the scripture. During this process, only a few people emitted faint glows, indicating they had gained some insights. Among them were Cui Chonghe, Su Shiyun, and Zhao Yaoting. Li Qingyue also gained something, radiating pure light as she sat there with closed eyes, incredibly sacred. What each person comprehended seemed to be different; at the very least, the light attached to their bodies varied greatly.

In the end, people gradually stopped, because what could be comprehended from the twelve pages had already been comprehended, and it was useless to spend more time on what couldn't be thoroughly understood. Only Qin Ming continued, and at the last moment, he even went to look at the main text, comparing it with the scripture.

Someone sneered. They admitted Qin Ming's achievements on the Newcomer's Path, perhaps possessing patriarch-level innate talent, but currently, trying to comprehend scriptures from other paths was purely a waste of time.

"Look, the Seeds of the Immortal Path and Divine Path, after comprehending parts of the scripture's principles, their external light is extraordinary. What has that Qin Ming comprehended?"

Someone couldn't help but speak, their voice neither too loud nor too soft, because everyone else had stopped, and only he continued.

Chu Pianran told that person not to say anything more, to avoid disturbing the young man in the arena.

*Whoosh!* Qin Ming's body suddenly erupted with black and white light! In an instant, the entire grand palace fell silent. His light was different from everyone else's.
