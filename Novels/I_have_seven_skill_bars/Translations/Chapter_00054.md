# Chapter 54: Finally a Spirit Farmer

When Ding Rui emerged from the logistics department, a wooden plaque embedded with five-element metal particles hung from his waist.

This was the symbol of a spirit farmer's identity. With this waist token, Ding Rui could exchange his spirit rice resources for things he needed at the logistics department. Other cultivators only gained such a token and rights after entering the Foundation Establishment stage and becoming an outer disciple, but as a spirit farmer, Ding Rui could enjoy them even in the Qi Refinement stage.

However, Ding Rui's mind wasn't on this waist token. At this moment, he was solely focused on the mountain of spirit rice in his room, which could finally be put to use. He no longer needed to suppress his cultivation and dare not use a single grain of spirit rice just to cultivate five cultivation techniques. On the contrary, to merge the skills of the five cultivation techniques, he would undoubtedly need to consume a large amount of spirit rice while simultaneously using five cultivation technique skills and cultivating all five techniques to develop his muscle memory for cultivation. And with countless uses of skills and the consumption of vast amounts of spirit rice, his strength would inevitably surge, allowing him to break through the realm he had maintained for two years.

"My first goal is the peak of Qi Refinement First Layer!" Ding Rui clenched his fists, feeling full of motivation.

At this point, he still had to return to Spirit Field 377 and wait for half a day.

This time, the cultivators who came were all those who hadn't shown much talent in the spirit fields. The number of cultivators in Spirit Field 377 had also increased from three to a full ten.

After settling the newcomers, the leading outer disciple walked up to Ding Rui and said, "Come on, let's move all the spirit rice from your room out."

Ding Rui's eyes widened instantly. "Move it by hand? Are we moving it directly by people?" He was surprised. Just by looking at the numbers, he knew that Spirit Field 377 and Spirit Field 520 were far apart. Moreover, there were dozens of sacks of spirit rice in his room. Even though cultivators were strong and robust, they weren't as strong as oxen. The cultivation of True Essence didn't significantly affect a cultivator's physical constitution. Just thinking about moving it by hand made Ding Rui's scalp tingle.

The outer disciple laughed upon hearing this. "What are you thinking? There's a floating boat outside. We just need to move it out and put it on the floating boat."

"Floating boat?" Ding Rui was startled; this was another term he had just heard.

"It's a spiritual artifact used to transport supplies on the battlefield. You'll see it soon. Thanks to you, we can all ride the floating boat over, but the cost of the floating boat's consumption will be deducted from your rewarded spirit rice," the other party said.

"Wait! It's going to be deducted from the spirit rice rewarded to me?" Ding Rui instantly became agitated. "How much will be deducted? How will it be deducted?"

"Haha, just kidding. The sect isn't short on your small amount of spirit rice." The outer disciple burst into laughter as he saw Ding Rui's anxious expression.

After seeing Ding Rui's actions, the outer disciple helping him move the spirit rice laughed again. "What are you touching down there? Floating boats float from above. Fire-floating arrays are inscribed on the boat. The array constantly heats the air, and by pulling the floating boat, it's able to float... Hiss... Yes, that's right, I heard from a brother in the Artifact Hall that it's like this. Although I didn't build the boat, I'm certain it floats because of the fire-floating array!"

Upon hearing this, Ding Rui immediately looked up towards the sky above the floating boat. Naturally, there was nothing but empty space above the floating boat. Coupled with the outer disciple's previous record of tricking Ding Rui, Ding Rui couldn't help but cast a suspicious glance at him.

The outer disciple immediately glared. "Junior Brother, you must believe your Senior Brother!"

"I do believe you!" Ding Rui nodded, yet his face clearly showed disbelief.
