# Chapter 6: Spells and Divine Abilities

He carefully scanned the light screen. It was filled with courses on various spells. Rain Spirit Art, Fire Serpent Art, Fire Control Art—everything was available.

"I can only learn two spells. Which ones should I choose?" Zhang Yan subtly furrowed his brow. His opportunities to learn spells were limited. Once he finished these two, further advancement would require spirit stones or contribution points. Therefore, these two spells were extremely important to him right now.

"My cultivation isn't high, and my strength is meager. Furthermore, I've been staying within the sect and don't need to go out on sect missions yet. So, currently, I don't really need combat-oriented spells. On the contrary, I need to earn spirit stones and contribution points, which means I need auxiliary spells, preferably ones that can help me earn spirit stones quickly."

With this thought, Zhang Yan had already made his decision. He needed to learn the spells required by a Spirit Planter. As for why he wouldn't learn the spells required by an Alchemist, the reason was simple. Refining a single batch of pills required many ingredients. These ingredients often cost a considerable amount of spirit stones. Even for an alchemist who had achieved minor success, there was no guarantee that every batch of pills would succeed. On top of that, he would also need pill formulas. He had none of these things, so how could he refine pills? Even if, by some miracle, he had the formulas and succeeded in refining them all, how would he explain it to others? After all, without a proper master, how could an alchemist become self-taught and succeed?

"The fastest is Wood Elemental Art, starting in half an hour."
"And the Geng Metal Pheasant Sword will begin in three days?"

Having seen the information, Zhang Yan took out his jade token and began to register. "Why does this feel like rushing to sign up for courses in university?" Shaking off this strange feeling, he marked both the Wood Elemental Art and Geng Metal Pheasant Sword courses. This marking wouldn't deduct from his free learning opportunities; after all, he was only attending a trial lecture for now.

Since Wood Elemental Art was starting in half an hour, he waited for a while at Enlightenment Peak, eating something there in the interim. "They're a bunch of leeches! A single meal costs one contribution point! It's practically robbery!" Zhang Yan was somewhat exasperated, yet helpless. He should have brought his own food!

Soon, the Wood Elemental Art lecture began. Zhang Yan entered the Hall of Enlightenment with his jade token. The moment he stepped inside, he felt a sudden sense of enlightenment. From the outside, the Hall of Enlightenment didn't look large, but upon entering, the space inside was surprisingly vast. "A mustard seed containing a Sumeru world?" "Like the concept of a storage bag?" Following the guidance, he quickly arrived at a room. After entering, there was something resembling a lecturer's platform inside, and below it were individual meditation cushions. Perhaps because he had arrived early, almost instinctively, Zhang Yan wanted to walk over to the foremost cushion.

But to his surprise, before him, a girl in a daoist robe, with fair skin and delicate features, plonked herself down on the very cushion he wanted. "This..." Seeing this scene, Zhang Yan immediately started scratching his ears and cheeks, feeling vexed. He really wanted that meditation cushion! But he couldn't just chase the girl away. He could only sulkily sit down next to her, consoling himself that this meditation cushion's effect wasn't bad either. Seeing Zhang Yan sit next to her, the girl, who appeared to be around his age, subtly scrunched up her delicate nose, but she didn't say anything.

As the disciples took their seats, the entire lecture hall became lively. All around, there were people of all kinds—men, women, old, and young. Not long after, a middle-aged man gracefully entered and sat directly on the topmost meditation cushion. There was no need to guess; this was the lecturer for Wood Elemental Art.

"My name is Lin Sen, and from now on, I will be your lecturer for Wood Elemental Art."
