# Chapter 194: Success

Li Shiming didn't hesitate for a moment. He firmly believed in his body's ability to withstand high temperatures—at least for a short period without suffering damage.

To minimize any spiritual energy fluctuations, he didn't even activate his defensive spiritual artifact. Just like that, he charged straight into the giant bear's den.

His eyes immediately locked onto the Solaris Trefoil. A jade box appeared in his hand—a container specially prepared for storing high-quality spiritual herbs.

In his other hand appeared a short jade sword. This wasn't a magical weapon but a tool given by Xu Chuan specifically for harvesting Solaris Trefoil.

With gentle precision, the jade sword lifted the root of the Solaris Trefoil from the rock. At the slightest touch, the roots released their grip on the stone and fell neatly into the jade box.

Although the Solaris Trefoil wasn't fully mature yet, Xu Chuan had mentioned that the Shu Mountain Sect had methods to accelerate its growth. Therefore, there was no need to wait for complete maturity before harvesting this spiritual herb.

Of course, if the Solaris Trefoil was far from maturity, even forced growth wouldn't be able to bring a third-grade spiritual herb to full ripeness.

The advantage of this approach was that it eliminated the need to wait for that precise moment of harvest, reducing the difficulty of collection.

After securing the Solaris Trefoil, Li Shiming's gaze fell upon a small flame flickering on the red rock.

When he had observed the area through the drone's camera earlier, the flames around the red rock hadn't left any particular impression on him.

But now, up close, he could sense that this tiny flame was entirely different from the others—it was brimming with spiritual energy, undoubtedly a spiritual entity of some kind.

He didn't have time to linger. Extending his spiritual sense toward the flame, he attempted to collect it.

But the moment his spiritual sense made contact, the small flame moved with an indescribable speed—almost like teleportation—following his spiritual sense directly into his body.

His heart skipped a beat, but there was no time to dwell on it. Through the drone's feed, he could already hear the distant roar of the giant bear, which had sensed the disturbance in its den.

Li Shiming swiftly stored the jade box in his machine room space. Flipping out of the den, he simultaneously tossed an oversized bomb inside.

His body transformed into a streak of sword light as he plunged toward the ground. At the same time, 'Starlife' fireproof material enveloped his entire body. The entire sequence took no more than a single breath before he was buried half a meter underground.

*Boom!* The explosion shattered the bear's den, sending countless rocks flying.

Following the rocks came the lava. It seemed the boulders had been sealing the lava beneath—likely due to a fissure connecting to an underground magma chamber, creating the environment necessary for the Solaris Trefoil to grow.

Li Shiming's explosion shattered the rocks sealing the fissure, resulting in a small volcanic eruption.

The spewing lava quickly turned the den and its surroundings into a sea of fire.

The giant bear was incredibly fast. Although it had chased the explosion some distance away, it took only two breaths for it to return upon sensing the anomaly in its den.

At the sight of the destroyed den, the bear's eyes turned bloodshot.

Its third-grade Solaris Trefoil—its Crimson Sun Spiritual Flame—all gone.

Just then, it detected a surge of spiritual energy rapidly retreating in the distance. Without hesitation, it gave chase, certain that whoever was fleeing must be the thief who had stolen its treasures.

Meanwhile, on the left peak, a small rocket covered in formation runes ignited automatically as the countdown reached zero.

This small rocket was an experimental model Li Shiming had created while working on larger rockets. Given its size, it couldn't carry passengers or much ammunition, making it essentially useless for practical purposes.

But for luring the giant bear, it was perfect. Li Shiming had programmed the rocket's navigation to target the lake inhabited by the four-clawed flood dragon.

He wasn't sure if the rocket could travel that far—after all, the path was fraught with powerful spiritual beasts.

But the rocket's speed was undeniably fast. Due to its lightweight construction, it reached maximum velocity almost instantly.

Though small, the rocket's engine was a perfect scaled-down replica, using liquid hydrogen as fuel.

Because the rocket required minimal materials, Li Shiming had crafted it entirely from spiritual materials, effectively making it a low-grade magical artifact—custom-ordered from the Hidden Dragon Trading Company during his time at the Tianhai Sect.

Upon ignition, the rocket's formations emitted faint spiritual energy fluctuations. Though subtle, they were glaringly obvious to the enraged half-step demonic bear.

The bear transformed into a crimson blur, chasing after the rocket.

Through his drone feed, Li Shiming waited until the bear was far enough away before emerging from underground.

His body was now covered in a layer of black—the outer shell of the 'Starlife' fireproof material had charred, but the temperature inside remained bearable.

It was unlikely the bear had anticipated any creature hiding beneath the lava right under its nose.

Even fire-attribute spiritual beasts needed to expend their own spiritual energy to avoid being burned by the lava.

The extreme heat of the magma also masked Li Shiming's carefully concealed presence.

Ultimately, the bear wasn't a true demonic beast yet, and its rage had clouded its judgment.

This entire plan had been devised by Li Shiming and the IBMz15, based on an analysis of the bear's behavior. The estimated success rate had been over 80%, which was why Li Shiming had gone through with it.

Emerging from underground, Li Shiming shed the charred 'Starlife' material and transformed into a streak of sword light, fleeing in the opposite direction.

After traveling several hundred miles, he finally found a secluded cave to rest in.

Using several spirit stones to set up a formation around the cave, his first priority was to inspect his body.

The small flame's entry had left him unsettled—his knowledge didn't include any spiritual entities like it.

Sitting cross-legged, he scanned his body with his consciousness.

When his awareness reached his spiritual lake, he found the small flame resting at its center.

Li Shiming sensed that the flame was absorbing his fire and lightning spiritual energy. Fortunately, its appetite was modest, taking only tiny amounts at a time.

Since this was his own spiritual lake, his consciousness easily captured and made contact with the flame.

The flame possessed a faint intelligence, responding with a sense of joy when touched by his awareness.

A thought struck him. Mentally, he issued a command to the flame.

Immediately, the flame left his spiritual lake and appeared on his fingertip, flickering playfully.

To his surprise, his finger felt no heat from the flame—it was as if its temperature matched his own.

Searching his storage bag, he found a small piece of first-grade ore—likely loot from some unfortunate cultivator.

Holding it above the flame with his spiritual sense, nothing happened at first, disappointing him. He had hoped the flame could melt the ore, allowing him to use it for artifact forging.

But as soon as the thought crossed his mind, the flame seemed to respond.

A faint but terrifying aura emanated from it, and the first-grade ore instantly liquefied, all impurities refined away, leaving only pure first-grade metal.

Li Shiming nearly flung the flame off his finger in shock.

Fortunately, the flame had precise control over what it burned and seemed to regard him as its master, sparing his finger from harm.

As he held the molten metal with his spiritual sense, it quickly solidified once removed from the flame.

The quality was nearly perfect—unimaginably so for first-grade metal.

For artificers, removing impurities from ore was the most challenging part, often determining whether a weapon would be low, mid, or high grade.

The same first-grade ore, forged by different artificers, could yield vastly different results.

Of course, some ores were naturally high-grade, requiring only competent craftsmanship to produce mid or high-grade materials.

This tiny flame had effectively done half an artificer's work—refining spiritual ore was the foundation of artifact forging, the first and most crucial step.

Next, Li Shiming took out a second-grade ore and repeated the process.

Again, the ore liquefied, all impurities removed.

Once cooled, he was left with pure second-grade metal.

However, after this refinement, he sensed fatigue from the flame's weak consciousness. He allowed it to return to his spiritual lake.

The flame resumed absorbing his fire and lightning spiritual energy—this time, roughly equivalent to the amount used for a single 'Lightning Strike' spell.

He didn't mind the expenditure. Compared to the flame's utility, the energy cost was negligible.

With the Solaris Trefoil secured, his next task was to leave the Ten Thousand Mountains.

Thanks to Xu Chuan's foresight, he already had a method—using the Shu Mountain Sect's connections.

Additionally, he needed to reunite with Li Yuanba. Traveling together would be safer, especially when crossing the defensive line between the Ten Thousand Mountains and the outside world. With Li Yuanba, a disciple of the Dark Forest Sect, they wouldn't face any trouble.

Li Shiming maintained his routine—traveling by day, resting at night. This time, he took a different route, avoiding the four-clawed flood dragon's lake.

A few days later, he met up with Li Yuanba.

Though Li Yuanba lacked Li Shiming's array of tricks, with Jiang Chen's assistance and the path already scouted by Li Shiming and Xu Chuan, the journey had been smooth.

"Fellow Daoist, you've worked hard!" Li Shiming said with a smile.

"You're too kind!" Li Yuanba replied, grinning.

Despite sharing the same consciousness, the two personas maintained their established dynamic.

"Here's your share." Li Shiming divided the monkey wine equally with Li Yuanba. According to the IBMz15's calculations, even half the amount he'd obtained would be enough to master both his body-refining techniques up to the Foundation Establishment stage.

Beyond that, at the Golden Core stage, the wine's effects would be negligible.

A Golden Core cultivator's body, even without specialized training, was already incredibly resilient.

A spiritual monkey king of its caliber could be crushed effortlessly—its wine would be more of a luxury than a cultivation resource.

He had no intention of selling such a treasure. Instead, sharing it with Li Yuanba would accelerate his body-refining progress.

The stronger Li Yuanba became, the more resources he could secure—ultimately benefiting Li Shiming.

"Thank you!" Li Yuanba accepted the wine with a laugh.

The two spent another ten days traversing the Ten Thousand Mountains before finally emerging into Dark Forest Sect territory.

Once clear of the mountains, Li Yuanba summoned his jade flying boat, piloting it with Li Shiming aboard.

As expected, the Dark Forest Sect insignia ensured smooth passage—other cultivators gave way upon sight.

Even those with grudges against the sect wouldn't provoke an unknown disciple without cause.

For the first time, Li Shiming had the chance to admire the Ten Thousand Mountains from above.

The range lived up to its name—endless peaks divided into numerous mountain chains.

Under the protection of cultivators, mortals had carved out cities and farmland, safe from spiritual beasts.

Compared to the perilous beast territories, the human domain thrived with vitality.

Li Yuanba's enrollment in the Dark Forest Sect had somewhat altered Li Shiming's perception of the sect.

Though a demonic sect, its strict, merit-based systems hinted at a resurgence.

At least on the surface, few demonic traits were visible—though Li Yuanba's exposure might still be too shallow.

Having completed three missions and turned in the heads of two wanted criminals, Li Yuanba was exempt from further tasks for a year, giving him time to focus on cultivation.

"Fellow Daoist, this is as far as I go," Li Yuanba said, landing the boat.

After ten days of travel, they had reached a city near the defensive line.

"Take care," Li Shiming replied with a smile.

Li Yuanba departed on his jade boat, vanishing into the distance. Only then did Li Shiming head toward the city.

This parting might last a long while. Learning of the Dark Forest Sect's massive defensive line spanning tens of thousands of miles along the Ten Thousand Mountains' border had made that clear.

Their next meeting would likely be when both had risen in their respective sects—or when they reached the Golden Core stage.
