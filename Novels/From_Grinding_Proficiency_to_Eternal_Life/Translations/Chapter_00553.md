Chapter 553: The Ritual of Proving the Dao with the Profound Firmament Nine Palaces Divine Thunder Immortal Sutra

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over the "Vision" attribute panel, invisible to ordinary people, that hung in the void.

These were the most advanced cultivation arts and traits he possessed. Aside from these, there were other true arts like the *Eight Sceneries Cloud Art of Xuan Du's Creation*, the *Myriad Chariots Sword Art*, and the *True Sutra of Yin-Yang Intersection and Separation*.

Scanning his attributes on the panel, Xu Yunfan felt a slight surprise. He hadn't realized he had already cultivated several top-tier true arts to his name.

For a typical cultivator, possessing even one true art would be considered a blessing from the heavens.

And here he was, with several, all progressing steadily and showing no small amount of advancement.

At the very least, he had mastered the Eight Sceneries Cloud Art to the point of effortless control, and it was on the verge of Great Perfection.

As for the Myriad Chariots Sword Art, thanks to the fortune of his clone, Han Shi, he could verify his understanding at regular intervals, causing his proficiency to rise rapidly. It had already reached Great Perfection and was not far from being fully perfected.

Xu Yunfan figured he would need to find a reason to release Han Shi from the Divine Martial World soon. With the other's sword Dao talent, it would be a trivial matter for him to be accepted into the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect.

When Xu Yunfan focused his attention on the "Divine Thunder Dao Fruit Resonance" line, a grand, sacred, and seemingly all-encompassing will, eternal and indestructible, faintly appeared at the edge of his perception.

It was like a brilliant star hanging in the boundless high heavens, or the core supreme law governing the运转 of heaven and earth, exuding a pressure that made even a Foundation Establishment cultivator feel insignificant and breathless, alongside an ultimate temptation.

The Supreme Jade Clarity Nine Palaces Profound Firmament Myriad Transformations Immortal Sutra Dao Fruit!

This was one of the 108 Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Dao Fruits in the Taihua Lingxu World, ranking among the highest of the Heavenly Gang.

The one who holds it shall be the Lord of Myriad Thunders, the尊 of the Nine Heavens, ruling the Profound Firmament, and achieving Myriad Transformations and Immortality.

To truly draw the favor of this Dao Fruit and have it bestow the opportunity to prove the Dao, one requires a great vow, great merit, and great action!

Ascend the Nine Heavens!
Tread the Profound Firmament!
Establish the Celestial Palace!
Slay demons and purge the cosmos!

The ritual for proving the Dao with it is incredibly vast and difficult. The so-called "slaying of demons" refers not only to killing mountain spirits and foreign fiends, but also to killing those whom heaven and earth deeply "detest."

What is this detestation?

Those Golden Core True Lords who madly devour the spiritual qi of heaven and earth, like parasitic locusts, refining the spiritual veins of a realm or Heavenly Grotto into themselves, severing the vitality of all things.

These people are the greatest "cancers" of this world.

To kill them is to "slay fiends" for heaven and earth, to return the stolen foundation, and thereby gain the true recognition of the world, allowing one to receive the strongest Dao Fruit.

But to slay a Golden Core True Lord is nothing but a pipe dream.

Back when the Divine Thunder Nine Palaces True Lord performed his ritual, he only succeeded by luring and killing over twenty Foundation Establishment True Lords.

For a Foundation Establishment cultivator to slay a Golden Core—what qualifications or virtue could one possibly have for that?

Even with his Attribute Panel, Xu Yunfan knew it was just a wishful thought.

To kill twenty-nine Foundation Establishment True Lords in one go would be an act that would provoke the fury of both heaven and man.

He had no idea how the Divine Thunder Nine Palaces True Lord managed to do it back then.

Especially that Attribute Panel...

As his gaze swept over the cultivation progress of the *Profound Firmament Nine Palaces Divine Thunder Immortal Sutra* once more, Xu Yunfan's heart began to pound uncontrollably.

In at most thirty years, he would be able to seek the Golden Core and prove his Dao Fruit.

According to ancient texts and sect common sense, no matter how well this Dao Fruit suited him, to call it down, he would have to complete that earth-shattering ritual, subduing hordes of fiends and shaking the heavens and earth.

That would inevitably attract countless covetous gazes and obstructions—a path of nine deaths and one life.

But the accumulation of "proficiency" on his Attribute Panel was not merely about increasing the power of his cultivation arts.

Every time the proficiency of the *Profound Firmament Nine Palaces Divine Thunder Immortal Sutra* increased by a single point, he could faintly feel his connection to the "Divine Thunder Dao Fruit" hidden within the heavens and earth deepening by a fraction.

That invisible bond became clearer and more solid.

This connection was not like the ritual, which caused a grand commotion and resonated with the heavens. Instead, it was like a gentle, trickling stream, moistening things silently, deepening secretly and steadily.

This feeling was as if the accumulation of proficiency itself was a silent, "ultra-micro ritual" that perfectly fulfilled the requirements of the Dao Fruit.

"Does this mean that as long as I max out this 'proficiency,' I can牵引 the Dao Fruit and reach the Golden Core True Lord realm without needing that earth-shattering ritual?!"

Xu Yunfan wouldn't need to slay a True Lord against the odds, nor would he need to lure and kill twenty-nine Foundation Establishment True Lords. As long as the proficiency on his Attribute Panel was achieved, he should be able to immediately seek the Golden Core and prove his Dao Fruit. He wouldn't have to desperately hunt down Foundation Establishment True Lords, only to potentially be surrounded and killed one day.

This could be verified with every single cultivation session. With every point of proficiency added, the Dao Fruit became a fraction clearer.

This also meant he wouldn't need to expose his intentions or attract the sniper attacks and schemes of various True Lords. Between silence and water flowing naturally, he could ascend to the尊位 of Golden Core and flip the heavens and earth in one fell swoop.

Xu Yunfan let out a breath, an irrepressible smile spreading across his face.

With such a supreme Dao Fruit beckoning to him, the future was promising.

The Pure Yang Ancestor had truly gone to great lengths.

Xu Yunfan's heart swelled with emotion. He bowed deeply toward the void and said solemnly, "Disciple Xu Yunfan, thanks the Pure Yang Ancestor for the grace of passing down the Dao!"

Although he didn't know if the Pure Yang Ancestor could see him, at the very least, this display greatly satisfied the three Golden Core sword intents that protected him.

If not for the *Profound Firmament Nine Palaces Divine Thunder Immortal Sutra* passed down by the Pure Yang Ancestor, he would likely still be being used as a pawn. Even with the Attribute Panel, by the time he realized the truth, who knows how long it would have taken him.

Sensing the humming of the Golden Core sword intents, Xu Yunfan naturally bowed deeply once more.

"The Pure Yang Ancestor's grace truly benefits all generations!"

Even with Xu Yunfan's temperament, he couldn't help but let out a long laugh at this moment.

After his excitement subsided, he took several deep breaths, his eyes once again becoming deep and profound.

"The most urgent task now is to do everything possible to increase my proficiency."

Especially by practicing new arts and performing new 'actions.'

He steadied his mind and immediately took out the two newly acquired secret arts.

*The Inscription of Gloom-Eroding Heaven* and *The Solar-Lunar Pivot*.

With a tap of his fingertip, the star beast hide scroll recording the *Inscription of Gloom-Eroding Heaven* slowly unfurled.

Silver-white characters flowed like living things, explaining the supreme and诡秘 art of obscuring heavenly secrets, eroding divination, and distorting karma.

Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense sank into it, and his mind was immediately pulled into a chaotic and hazy "Heaven-Eroding" illusion. Heavenly secrets were as tangled as hemp, karma was inverted and dislocated, and all divination was being devoured and twisted.

He needed to slowly sort this out, then gradually comprehend it.

Time passed bit by bit. After an unknown amount of time...

> *You begin to comprehend the Inscription of Gloom-Eroding Heaven. This art is profound and诡异, your progress is arduous, Proficiency +1*
