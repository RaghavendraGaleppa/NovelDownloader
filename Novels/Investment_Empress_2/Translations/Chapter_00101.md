# Chapter 101: Clothes, Rewards, and an Inner Scene Duel?

Xiao Qin took out a letter, its paper identical to the material found on the Huashan Three Fiends last time. It had already been decoded by Zuoqiu Yang.

"My dear brothers, a scholar after three days apart should be looked at with new eyes. You have recently made a tremendous name for yourselves in the Infinite Trial. The Judge is very satisfied with you, especially with Dragon Fiend."

"The Judge personally praised him, saying he is a born killer."

The tone of the letter had become much more amiable. In just a few days, he had started calling them "little brothers."

*A born killer?*

Xiao Qin looked at Li Mo in surprise.

What kind of unspeakable atrocity had Junior Brother Li committed to earn such high praise from the Judge of the Drizzle Pavilion?

As expected of Junior Brother Li; it seems there is nothing he cannot do well.

"Ahem, let's continue reading."

Actually, Li Mo himself was baffled. What had he done?

He had simply beaten a few people to death and disposed of the bodies.

"Given the strength of you几位 brothers, passing the Infinite Trial should be effortless. After the trial, please come to the Lingjiang Pier for a gathering. The Judge has entrusted me with an important matter. I fought hard to secure this opportunity so that you can participate as soon as you join the Pavilion. When you rise to prominence then, don't forget me."

"—Laughing Maitreya presents this."

The letter ended there.

Li Mo and Xiao Qin couldn't help but look at each other.

They were starting to be involved in the Pavilion's affairs.

Did this mean they were... pre-admitted and guaranteed a spot?

"From Laughing Maitreya's tone, it seems the Judge's status in the Drizzle Pavilion is higher than his."

Xiao Qin was quite certain of this.

Actually, it was the Thousand-Form Martial Venerable who told him.

The Judge of the Drizzle Pavilion determines whether a killer has completed their mission and is the guarantor of the Pavilion's reputation.

"A Judge's personal matter... what could it be?"

"We haven't come into contact with this so-called Judge yet, but it definitely can't be anything good."

After thinking about it, Li Mo felt there must be a catch.

A group of assassins couldn't possibly be going out together to help old ladies cross the street, right?

Looking at the words requesting a meeting from Laughing Maitreya, Li Mo said:

"We should stick to our original plan. When we see Laughing Maitreya, we'll cut him down first. Otherwise, we risk exposing ourselves at any moment. Anyway, we've already been chosen to work for the Judge, so we'll definitely have a chance to meet him then."

"Alright."

Xiao Qin nodded and got back on the donkey cart, preparing to go back and tell Zuoqiu Yang the good news. The cart was full of cooking oil, which the hotpot restaurant used in large quantities every day.

***

The afternoon.

Happy times are always short.

[Congratulations, Host. You have invested a low-level martial art in "Big Pillar."]
[Investment Feedback: One year of martial arts insight.]

[Congratulations, Host. You have invested a low-level martial art in "Little Butterfly."]
[Investment Feedback: One year of martial arts insight.]

...

The little children all came out to bid a reluctant farewell. They had all just learned martial arts. Li Mo hadn't given them anything too good; these low-level martial arts were enough for now to lay a foundation.

After glancing around, Li Mo felt a bit puzzled.

"Where is little Chulong?"

He had found it strange in the afternoon. Chulong would always timidly call out to him, then hesitate and say it was nothing.

"Big Brother Li... I... I'm here."

Suddenly, Jiang Chulong ran over, holding a cloth bundle in her arms.

"This... this is for you."

She shoved the bundle into his arms.

Li Mo lowered his eyes and glanced at it. Inside was a piece of clothing, still crudely made. The fabric was quite good, with a sword embroidered on it. Moreover...

Why did this fabric look a bit familiar?

"Was the reason you went out to pick things up to save money for making clothes?"

"Mm... mm-hmm..."

"It's a pity that I'm... too clumsy... I wasted so much fabric..."

"It's not... a waste... I used the scraps... to make sachets..."

Chulong's voice was as soft as a mosquito's buzz.

Oh, I get it.

The sachets the Venerable received were products of recycling fabric scraps.

For a moment, Li Mo didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

***

But then he noticed something was off.

"You picked up so many things, and you only got enough money for a bit of fabric?"

"Yeah... trash... it's not worth much..."

"This... this one... can only... sell for ten... copper coins."

Chulong pointed at a pile of 'scrap iron' nearby.

Li Mo looked over and his eyelid twitched.

If he wasn't mistaken, that was an axe forged from hundred-refined steel. Although it wasn't new, it could easily be sold for thirty taels of silver at a blacksmith's shop.

Ten copper coins? Damn, that's a black shop! Has their conscience been eaten by dogs?!

"Chulong."

"Huh?"

"Tell me which shop usually recycles your things. I have something to discuss with them."

"Big Brother Li, do you... do you also want to... sell scrap?"

***

Lingjiang Pier.

An endless expanse of large and small ships were docked. The sound of river water lapping against the shore accompanied the fisherman's songs.

On the river, a black-canopied boat swayed gently.

"Li Mo and Ying Bing have finally appeared in the Prefecture City?!"

Yin Huacheng shattered the paper in his palm, letting it fall into the river and disappear without a trace.

The Ziyang Prefecture City had been thrown into turmoil because of the Infinite Trial.

It was said that the Huashan Three Fiends appeared and disappeared without a trace, their attacks ruthless. They were like three killing gods, striking fear into the hearts of the evil participants of the trial.

Because of them, the Infinite Trial was showing signs of ending early.

This storm would soon pass.

The opportunity was fleeting.

Suddenly, Yin Huacheng's ears twitched, and he said to the outside:

"You have come."

"For you to be an Envoy of the Demon Summoning Cult, you do have some skill."

A figure with a smiling Buddha's head lifted the boat curtain and walked in.

"You are the one sent by Judge Cui to handle the business?"

"That is correct."

Laughing Maitreya spoke, and it seemed as if Buddhist chants echoed in the air. It cleansed the mind, severed thoughts, and suppressed desires, making one indifferent to the prospect of death, willing to lower their head and await execution...

"This Buddhist technique you've trained in is like an evil art, hehe..."

"Interesting, sit."

Yin Huacheng poured the other a cup of tea, expressing his recognition of this level of strength.

"The sea of suffering is boundless; I only send people across it to achieve liberation and ascend to the Western Paradise early."

Laughing Maitreya nodded and sat down.

Yin Huacheng got straight to the point and asked:

"How goes the matter?"

"We are just waiting for the last batch of 'goods.' Once they are loaded and we set sail under the Red Whale Gang's banner, we will have a clear path. You can rest assured."

"When will the goods arrive?"

"When the Branch Pavilion Master arrives, the goods will arrive. When the Inner Scene duel begins, the goods can be sent out."

Laughing Maitreya said calmly.

"An Inner Scene duel..."

Yin Huacheng drank his tea, seemingly savoring the meaning behind the words.

"By the way, how much would it cost for you to kill an Inner Qi Realm expert and give all his belongings to me?"

"In the Dark Pavilion, there is a set price. The Envoy can go and post a bounty."

"How much would it take for *you* to take the job?" Yin Huacheng asked.

He wanted to be certain.

Currently, the Drizzle Pavilion's branch hadn't been established yet, so it wasn't easy to find a reliable killer.

"For me to act, it depends on fate."

Laughing Maitreya said impassively.

"One Xuan Crystal."

Yin Huacheng said through gritted teeth.

"You want to kill Li Mo, the true disciple of the Qingyuan Sect?"

Laughing Maitreya didn't agree; instead, he asked a question.

The subtext was: One Xuan Crystal isn't even worth the value of his Xuan Weapon, and we'd have to bear the wrath of the Qingyuan Sect. Do you think I'm stupid?

"I acquired this item by chance in my early years."

Yin Huacheng's expression changed, and he took out another item.

A scroll of a Buddha portrait.

It was a Buddha, but it sat on a black lotus. Within its compassionate expression lay a hint of strangeness, for beneath its lotus throne were the corpses of living beings, with rivers of blood. It was clearly a visualization diagram for some kind of martial art.

Laughing Maitreya's breathing became noticeably heavier.

After a long silence, he slowly spoke:

"The fates have aligned."
