# Chapter 42: What?!

Xu Yunfan slowly paced the courtyard, deep in thought. Finally, he recalled that when he had turned around, Qin Bo had glanced behind the courtyard wall, and his mood had instantly become abnormal.

Arriving at the wall, Xu Yunfan slowly squatted down. Applying force with both hands, he pried away the shattered blue bricks one by one.

When he saw the soil beneath, his eyebrows raised slightly. As someone with Intermediate Mining proficiency, he could tell at a glance that this soil was much fresher than the surrounding area, showing obvious signs of being disturbed.

However, it had been buried for a long time, appearing semi-old and semi-new. It looked like it had been buried three years ago. Although some treatment had been done, it was far too crude for him.

Xu Yunfan turned and quickly found a shovel, starting to dig.

With the bonus effect of his Intermediate Mining skill, the shovel cut into the soil as easily as cutting into tofu, quickly digging out a pit.

*Clang!*

A crisp sound rang out as the falling shovel struck a hard object.

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred, and he couldn't help but feel a bit of anticipation. Since Qin Bo valued this thing so much, it was probably some divine martial arts manual or a heavenly treasure. With this thought, he reached in and pulled an iron box out of the dirt.

He couldn't wait to open the box. Upon seeing the contents, the expression on his face instantly became incredibly complex—a mixture of shock, confusion, and disbelief.

"What the hell?!"

Half an hour later, Qin Bo slowly regained consciousness.

He wanted to move, but he found his hands and feet tightly bound by iron chains. No matter how hard he struggled, the chains didn't budge an inch.

"Is this yours?"

Xu Yunfan's voice, tinged with a strange tone, reached Qin Bo's ears.

Qin Bo looked up and saw a transparent glass bottle under Xu Yunfan's feet. Inside, something unbelievable was soaking in liquid.

"Give it back to me!!"

Qin Bo's eyes widened in fury, his eyes bulging. His body thrashed wildly, the veins on his surface bulging like wriggling earthworms. He exerted a terrifying strength, causing the chains on his body to grind with a "squeaking" sound.

"So it really is yours?!"

Looking at Qin Bo's reaction, Xu Yunfan's face was filled with strangeness. Now he finally understood why Qin Bo was so desperate to get this ancestral home back, why he had a mental breakdown after seeing the shattered blue bricks, and why he had suddenly pulled a knife and stabbed him, leaving a small cut on his waist that was still there.

Although the blood had dried up and it was about to scab over if he didn't treat it, it had still given him a bit of a psychological shadow.

If the other party had a blade-level weapon and stabbed him like that, he would have truly been done for.

This gave him a sense of urgency. He needed to speed up his cultivation to the Perfection stage. Perhaps he could find an even more advanced Body Tempering True Art, allowing him to be fearless against blade-level weapons.

As for the glass bottle, inside was the severed, most important thing for a man...

The moment Xu Yunfan understood what it was, his expression was incredibly dramatic, and he almost dropped the glass bottle in shock.

He gently nudged the glass bottle with his foot. The liquid inside swayed, and the soaking object shook along with it.

"Where did this glass bottle come from?"

Although he had spent most of these days immersed in the rise of his proficiency, he had gone out for a stroll.

The windows of the buildings in the city were, without exception, all made of paper. He had never seen a glass bottle similar to this before.

"Don't touch it! If you touch it again, I'll kill you!! You beast! If you have the guts, let me go, and let's fight with real swords and spears!"

Stimulated by this, Qin Bo roared madly, continuously cursing at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan acted as if he hadn't heard. He took a yellowed book from the box.

When he had flipped through this book earlier, the contents had stunned him on the spot.

This guy, Qin Bo, was actually trying to reconnect his severed root, frantically conducting experiments. The book detailed nearly a hundred human experiments.

This meant that over the past few years, Qin Bo had killed at least a hundred people.

The subjects of the experiments ranged from eight-year-old children to eighty-year-old elderly, none of whom were spared.

Flipping through these records, seeing all the bloody descriptions, Xu Yunfan felt a chill run from the soles of his feet straight to the top of his head, leaving his heart icy cold.

He had always thought that since transmigrating, his mindset was cold enough, but compared to this insane Qin Bo, he was practically a virtuous and good-natured young man.

Xu Yunfan slowly closed the experimental record in his hand, looking at Qin Bo with a gaze mixed with pity and disgust.

Being looked at by Xu Yunfan like this, Qin Bo almost went crazy, his face twisting.

"Don't look at me like that! Absolutely not! Why did you go through my things?! Why?!"

Xu Yunfan sighed helplessly: "Brother, if you wanted to learn from that Eunuch King, I wouldn't have blamed you. If you had just told me, it's not like I wouldn't have given it to you. Why did you have to hide it so securely? It made me think it was some incredible treasure. Why create such an irreconcilable grudge over this?"

What grudge, what resentment.

He really didn't discriminate against eunuchs.

Qin Bo had also calmed down slightly at this moment. He stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan, his eyes bloodshot and completely red.

Although he didn't know what "Eunuch King" meant by Xu Yunfan's words, Qin Bo naturally understood it wasn't anything good. But anyone who knew about this matter absolutely could not be spared.

Seeing Qin Bo's expression, Xu Yunfan's expression also cooled down. He knew clearly that the person in front of him was extremely extreme, and no amount of persuasion would work.

He said indifferently: "A fine young man, why do you need to become a eunuch? In the later stages of martial arts, under the ability of 'Heavenly Human Transformation,' regenerating a severed root is as easy as flipping a hand."

The scene of Li Haomiao's limbs regenerating was still shocking in his heart.

Human power could actually achieve such a feat.

It was beyond imagination.

Qin Bo almost lost his composure again upon hearing this. He stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan and suddenly let out a cold laugh.

"The ability of Heavenly Human Transformation, do you think it's that easy to achieve? Tempering the muscles, bones, and skin from the outside, the Three Unions merging into a circle, moving from the outside to the inside, practicing the flesh, blood, marrow, and qi. There are eight realms in the martial path. Starting from the Flesh Refining Realm, every step is a new heaven. To possess the ability of Heavenly Human Transformation, one must reach the Grandmaster of Qi Refining at the very least. You speak of it so lightly, but how many people in the world can actually achieve it?"

Perhaps because Xu Yunfan had seen his deepest secret, Qin Bo stopped hiding it.

His voice was low: "I was raised by a eunuch in the palace. This eunuch had three adopted sons. He said there was an entry slot for the palace, but it required castration. When the three of us drew lots, the one who drew the longest stick would be castrated and go to the palace. I had clearly marked the sticks and drew the shortest one, but that damn eunuch pushed me in to be castrated anyway. Just as he was preparing to send me into the palace, who would have thought he would have a stroke halfway and just withered away."

Qin Bo raised his head, his face a mix of crying and laughing.

"He died halfway, and the path was gone. It didn't matter if I was castrated or not. I was sent back to where I came from. How could I be willing to accept that? Since ancient legends say that immortals can bring life back with a drop of dew, I naturally took it to heart. But in the end, it was all for nothing!"
