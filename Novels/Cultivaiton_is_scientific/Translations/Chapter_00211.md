# Chapter 211: Initiation

"Your master hails from the 'Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion.' By accepting you as my disciple, you now hold dual identities—both as a disciple of the Senluo Sect and of the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion. This is something you must understand clearly!" Sword Elder explained as he led Li Yuanba into the inner chamber of the cave abode.

This was the first time Li Yuanba had heard of someone holding dual sect affiliations. But since Sword Elder mentioned it, he assumed the sect was aware of this arrangement.

"Where is the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion?" Li Yuanba couldn't recall ever hearing about such a faction. Despite both his main body and himself being part of two major sects, he had never come across any mention of it.

"The Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion isn't located in the Northern Shu Continent. If you ever reach the Nascent Soul stage, perhaps you'll have the chance to visit," Sword Elder replied, a trace of nostalgia in his eyes.

Back when Sword Elder was still a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he had encountered a catastrophic storm while at sea. Sucked into a vortex, he awoke to find himself on the Northern Shu Continent, where he was rescued by a Senluo Sect elder and became his disciple.

Returning to the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion was impossible. Without Nascent Soul-level strength, traversing the far more perilous seas beyond the North Sea would be tantamount to suicide. He had been fortunate enough to encounter a spatial vortex that safely transported him to Northern Shu.

From then on, he became a cultivator of the Senluo Sect. With his master's guidance, he eventually reached the Golden Core stage and took charge of the Ten Thousand Swords Peak.

Though the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion wasn't aligned with the righteous path, it wasn't a demonic sect either. Thus, Sword Elder, hailing from such a background, held little fondness for demonic cultivators.

It was ironic—a Golden Core elder of a demonic sect harboring disdain for demonic cultivators. Yet, this was the reality, making Sword Elder the most unique existence within the Senluo Sect.

Fortunately, Sword Elder's master had successfully ascended to the Nascent Soul stage, providing him with an unshakable backing. This allowed him to maintain his aloof demeanor without fear of reprisal. 

Moreover, Sword Elder's strength was undeniable. Now at the late Golden Core stage, he was virtually unmatched among his peers, second only to Nascent Soul cultivators. His contributions to the Senluo Sect's dominance over the Hundred Thousand Mountains were immense, leaving other elders with no grounds for complaint.

For a Golden Core cultivator like him, finding a suitable disciple within a demonic sect was an exceedingly difficult task.

Most who joined the demonic sect chose demonic techniques from the outset. Even those who didn't were inevitably influenced by the environment to supplement their cultivation with demonic methods to accelerate progress.

As for rogue cultivators who joined through other means, their established cultivation paths made it nearly impossible for them to master sword intent.

This was precisely why Sword Elder, upon seeing Li Yuanba and conducting a brief investigation, immediately issued an assessment task. Finding a suitable disciple was no easy feat.

Entering the inner chamber, Li Yuanba noticed a painting on the wall depicting a mist-shrouded mountain peak. At its summit stood a towering pavilion inscribed with the words "Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion." 

Faint figures could be seen moving within the pavilion, and the mist around the mountain seemed to flow—the painting appeared almost alive. He soon realized it was a magical artifact, its aura so subtle he hadn't detected it at first.

"Yuanba, come and pay your respects to the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion," Sword Elder instructed after performing a reverent bow before the painting.

Li Yuanba knelt before the painting and kowtowed three times in the traditional initiation ritual. He then turned and bowed deeply to Sword Elder, who smiled approvingly.

Rising to his feet, Li Yuanba stood respectfully by Sword Elder's side.

"Ancestors above, your disciple today accepts Li Yuanba as a disciple of the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion. I shall ensure he abides by its rules. May the ancestors bear witness!" Sword Elder declared solemnly to the painting before turning to Li Yuanba with a smile. "From this day forth, you are a disciple of the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion."

His tone suggested that the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion held even greater importance than the Senluo Sect.

"From now on, the 'Ten Directions Sword Art' you've been cultivating will serve as a supplementary technique. You must switch to the 'Sword Intent Soaring Art,'" Sword Elder said, his demeanor noticeably warmer after the initiation ceremony.

"Master, I've been practicing the 'Ten Directions Sword Art' for some time and possess its complete manual, including the Nascent Soul stage sections," Li Yuanba explained, thinking Sword Elder might not know he had the full version. 

Changing cultivation techniques was no trivial matter—it could significantly impact a cultivator's future path. Li Yuanba had already mapped out his cultivation journey, with his clone focusing on rapid progress to support his main body.

"I'm not asking you to abandon the Ten Directions Sword Art. As a disciple of the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion, you must prioritize the Sword Intent Soaring Art. Besides, how can the Ten Directions Sword Art compare?" Sword Elder scoffed.

Seeing Sword Elder's attitude, Li Yuanba didn't press further. Resistance was futile—his master had spoken, and switching techniques was inevitable. 

Fortunately, he was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage, making the transition relatively straightforward.

"As you command, Master," he replied with a bow.

"You won't lose out. Had I not been a true disciple of the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion, I wouldn't possess the complete Sword Intent Soaring Art. This technique far surpasses most in the Northern Shu Continent," Sword Elder said with a laugh.

Li Yuanba detected an underlying message—his master held a condescending view of the Northern Shu Continent's methods. Perhaps feeling no need to hide such sentiments before his disciple, Sword Elder's disdain was genuine.

In the cultivation world, the bond between master and disciple often surpassed even that of parent and child in the mortal realm. While mortal relationships lasted mere decades, cultivators could spend centuries together, especially between Golden Core masters and their disciples.

After Li Yuanba paid homage to the painting, Sword Elder truly regarded him as one of his own.

"Ah, I haven't assigned you a cave abode yet. You'll take the one on the opposite side of Ten Thousand Swords Peak's summit. It's just the two of us here anyway," Sword Elder said, clapping his hands.

This was his first time taking a disciple—a rare opportunity, as finding someone who met his standards wasn't easy. In his excitement, he was doing his best to fulfill a master's duties.

Sword Elder took Li Yuanba's identity jade tablet and upgraded his status from outer sect disciple to true disciple. With no other disciples, this sole apprentice naturally received the highest rank. 

Without needing to compete with other Golden Core elders' disciples, Sword Elder directly granted Li Yuanba his allocated true disciple slot.

"Today, settle in. Tomorrow morning, return here, and I'll teach you the Sword Intent Soaring Art," Sword Elder said as they stood before the five flying sword artifacts on Ten Thousand Swords Peak.

"Yes, Master," Li Yuanba replied with a bow.

There was no need to return to his old outer sect cave abode—he had left nothing behind. He proceeded directly to the new abode on Ten Thousand Swords Peak.

Upon unlocking the cave with his identity jade, he immediately noticed something extraordinary.

"This is a Golden Core-level cave abode!" he exclaimed, sensing the incredibly dense spiritual energy.

He hadn't expected Sword Elder to assign him such a high-grade residence. Though Ten Thousand Swords Peak had no other occupants, this treatment far exceeded what a Foundation Establishment cultivator typically received.

The interior was spacious, particularly the cultivation chamber. Beyond the rich spiritual energy, faint traces of pure sword intent lingered—a priceless environment for sword cultivators, subtly enhancing their sword intent alongside their spiritual power.

"Having connections sure makes a difference," Li Yuanba mused, marveling at his new cultivation environment.

Remembering the Senluo Sect's true disciple he had killed during the mission, he retrieved a storage bracelet. 

First, he examined the Earthen Shield Pearl. Though it had failed to protect Ren Pengxiao, its defensive capabilities were formidable. Li Yuanba's final strike had been his strongest, augmented by his third-grade sword's superior quality and his newly grasped Sword Intent Threading technique—otherwise, breaching the pearl's defense would have been impossible.

Had Ren Pengxiao activated his talisman treasure, Li Yuanba would have needed to summon Jiang Chen for protection. The talisman treasure—a Mountain Talisman with two remaining uses—now served as another trump card.

The Earthen Shield Pearl was useless to him, requiring earth-attribute spiritual energy to activate, but he could pass it to his main body later.

His spiritual sense probed the storage bracelet, revealing considerable wealth—unsurprising, as true disciples were entrusted with resources before their sect's fall. 

A million spirit stones seemed modest to him. More valuable were the second-grade materials: artifacts, formation disks, talismans, pills, and various other resources worth millions. 

But what truly caught his eye was a glowing yellow rock—a third-grade earth-attribute material containing exceptionally pure earth spiritual energy, exactly what his main body, Li Shiming, needed.

It seemed a meeting with his main body was in order—to deliver both the Earthen Shield Pearl and the earth-attribute material. 

Additionally, Li Yuanba needed to cultivate the "Purple Qi From the East" technique, which significantly enhanced physical and spiritual constitution. To maximize its effects, he'd require the complete set of 1,500 Fresnel reflectors.

Though he currently lacked an ideal location for this, as a true disciple, requesting a private mountain from his master shouldn't be an issue.

He donned the storage bracelet openly—as a true disciple now, he no longer needed to fear attracting unwanted attention, even if Sword Elder and the sect hadn't provided one.

---

The next morning, Li Yuanba arrived early at the five flying swords. Sword Elder had yet to appear.

Sensing the pervasive sword intent throughout Ten Thousand Swords Peak—something he hadn't been able to examine closely with Sword Elder present—he tentatively released his own sword intent.

The peak's sword intent enveloped his, and he felt his control weakening. Startled, he realized it was being consumed. 

He hastily withdrew his sword intent, but not before losing a portion equivalent to weeks of cultivation. Had he reacted slower, the loss would have been far greater.

"The sword intent of Ten Thousand Swords Peak was accumulated over generations. Though masterless, it retains a protective consciousness," Sword Elder's voice came from behind—he had arrived unnoticed, witnessing the entire episode.

"Master," Li Yuanba greeted promptly.

"My master secured Ten Thousand Swords Peak for me to pass down the Sword Intent Soaring Art within the Senluo Sect. Taking you as my disciple fulfills that duty. Once my master emerges from seclusion, I'll introduce you to your grandmaster," Sword Elder said, gazing at the peak.

Li Yuanba noted the implication—Sword Elder's master was a Nascent Soul patriarch.

"The Sword Intent Soaring Art is an ancient sword cultivation legacy. Five of our pavilion's ancestors ascended to the upper realm using this method. Our survival owes not just to sword cultivators' might, but also to immortal guardians above," Sword Elder continued.

"Master, does the upper realm truly exist?" Li Yuanba asked eagerly.

"Absolutely. Ancient sects with ascended ancestors can communicate with them through special means. Such matters are premature for you. Just know that mastering the Sword Intent Soaring Art can lead to ascension," Sword Elder affirmed.

Li Yuanba was awestruck. Though unaware of the exact requirements for ascension—far beyond the Northern Shu Continent's Nascent Soul patriarchs—he now understood why Sword Elder dismissed the Ten Directions Sword Art. He even considered having his main body switch techniques.

"Starting today, I impart the Sword Intent Soaring Art. You must swear by your soul never to teach it except to your own Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion disciples—or face soul annihilation," Sword Elder solemnly declared before the transmission.
