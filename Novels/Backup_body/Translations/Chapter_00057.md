# Chapter 57: Elder Gu on the Sickbed!

In the inner courtyard of Gu Yue Peak, Li Zhengjing sat quietly in his room, watching as the sun set behind the western mountains. Once night fell, he would go to meet Elder Gu. He didn’t know whether he would be facing Elder Gu or the Thousand Illusions Deity Lord, but his heart was anything but calm.

"Master, everything is ready," the Five Elements Creation Tree announced proudly as it scurried in. "The Buddhist beads from the Vajra Temple’s disciple have been restrung without any mistakes."

"The wooden box obtained from the Venom King Xin Xuan has a hidden compartment inside. The fact that he could store hundreds of thousands of venomous insects in such a small box shows how extraordinary it is. After careful examination, I discovered that the material of this box is actually carved from remnants of the Divine Phoenix Tree. It’s incredibly spacious inside—enough for me to hide in when accompanying you on your travels."

"Moreover, it’s engraved with formation patterns from the Central Continent’s techniques. It seems someone from the Central Continent must have refined it for him. It can refine spirit stones to provide spiritual energy inside. There are twelve slots here—just insert spirit stones, and the box will be filled with abundant spiritual energy. Over time, the venomous insects inside can continue to grow!"

It handed over the wooden box with its newly sprouted tender branches. Li Zhengjing took it and examined it closely, marveling at its craftsmanship. He placed twelve graded spirit stones inside and sensed the gradual transformation of spiritual energy within.

"Whoever colluded with the Venom King Xin Xuan must have an extremely high level of expertise in formations," he mused.

He then placed the Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill, three Creation Five Mysteries Pills, and other spirit stones into the box. Satisfied, he rewarded the Five Elements Creation Tree with fresh Mystic Breath Crimson Soil and Spirit Origin Heavenly Dew, nurturing it carefully.

"Thank you for your generosity, Master!" The tree was moved to tears. "The materials you retrieved earlier have already been used on the Divine King Gu. It’s gradually regaining vitality and is now gathering its last reserves of strength to lay eggs before its death. It should take about half a month to complete. I’ll take good care of it to repay your kindness!"

"You’ve worked hard. Once the Divine King Gu lays its eggs, I’ll reward you handsomely," Li Zhengjing said before standing up. He removed the low-grade spirit stones embedded in the slender black sword at his waist and placed them into the wooden box.

Then he grasped the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, bestowed upon him by the Gu Yue Peak’s Chief. This was a true divine weapon—a top-tier spiritual artifact, just one step away from being classified as a treasure!

In comparison, the slender black sword embedded with low-grade spirit stones was practically scrap metal. If the two blades clashed, the black sword would undoubtedly snap in two, while the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber wouldn’t even bear a scratch.

"The Peak Chief must have heard that you prefer using sabers," the Wall-Climbing Bird remarked as it flew in, eyeing the weapon admiringly. "Within the Immortal Sect, most favor swords, while sabers are rare. This Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber is said to be an early masterpiece of the Artifact Refining Pavilion’s Chief!"

"You know about this saber?" Li Zhengjing asked in surprise.

"My grandfather mentioned it," the bird replied, then added smugly, "Besides, I’ve always been exceptionally knowledgeable—"

"Impressive," Li Zhengjing responded half-heartedly as he ran his fingers along the saber’s blade. "The material of this weapon is quite unusual—it alternates between cold and warm."

"The raw material for this saber comes from the depths of Fengdu Mountain in the north—a metal known as Yin-Cold Divine Iron," the bird explained. "It fell into the hands of the Supreme Elder of the Wuding Mountain, who forged it into a saber, but the craftsmanship was crude."

"Later, when the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect conquered Wuding Mountain, the Artifact Refining Pavilion’s Chief obtained the saber and sought to refine it anew. However, the Earth Fiend Divine Fire used in treasure refinement would damage the Yin-Cold Divine Iron’s properties, so extreme care was required."

"By then, the saber had already taken shape, so it wasn’t reforged into a sword. Instead, the Formation Pavilion’s Chief was invited to inscribe the Yin-Yang Dual Formation Patterns onto it."

"Finally, numerous Yang-attribute treasures were used to balance the Yin and Yang, intending to elevate it to treasure-grade. But it fell just short…"

"Thus, this is likely the highest-grade saber among our sect’s spiritual artifacts."

The bird sighed. "Its failure to reach treasure-grade has been a sore point for the Artifact Refining Pavilion’s Chief, so it was kept hidden in the pavilion. The Gu Yue Peak Chief must hold you in extremely high regard to have persuaded the Artifact Refining Pavilion’s Chief to part with this Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber as your reward!"

"Obviously!" The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches excitedly. "After this, Master is undoubtedly the most outstanding rising star of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Soon, he’ll defeat Lu Huaiyuan to become the Chief Disciple, then outlast the current Sect Master to take his place—it’s only a matter of time!"

"Shut up!" Li Zhengjing swatted the tree aside and turned his attention back to the saber. "The Gu Yue Peak Chief sees me as a dead man walking, yet he gifts me the Creation Five Mysteries Pills and this Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber… What exactly is he planning?"

Though troubled by these thoughts, he showed no outward signs. Instead, he took out a jug of spirit wine and handed it to the Wall-Climbing Bird.

"You’ve earned this for enlightening me."

"Thank you, Master!" The bird was so moved it nearly shed tears. "This is genuine spirit wine, brimming with spiritual energy! I’ve been craving it for so long, but my grandfather never lets me drink, treating me like a fledgling. But I’m already eight—old enough to marry! Someday, I’ll need wine to set the mood, so building up my tolerance now is only natural."

With that, it eagerly uncorked the jug and plunged its head inside.

Li Zhengjing fastened the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber at his waist, left the wooden box containing his valuables behind, and checked the fortune displayed on the golden page. He exhaled in relief.

"At least I won’t die from meeting Elder Gu today."

With that thought, he pushed open the courtyard gate and ascended to the upper levels of Gu Yue Peak.

Now holding a gold-edged silver token, his status surpassed that of an inner disciple, placing him on par with inner elders. Thus, no one stopped him.

According to sect rules, his current rank entitled him to reside on the upper levels of Gu Yue Peak. However, wary of the secrets he harbored and the presence of the Peak Chief, he had chosen to remain in the inner disciple courtyard, citing his fondness for his original residence.

Upon reaching the upper peak, Li Zhengjing swallowed all the remaining graded spirit stones he had on him. Then he arrived at Elder Gu’s courtyard and knocked on the gate.

"Inner disciple Li Zhengjing of Gu Yue Peak requests an audience!"

"Enter!"

The gate opened, revealing a young attendant who bowed respectfully. Though technically a menial disciple, this attendant had begun cultivating external martial arts under Elder Gu’s guidance. Once he developed internal energy, he would be directly accepted as an inner disciple under Elder Gu’s tutelage.

For ordinary inner elders, such attendants were their legacy disciples. Within the sect, their status was subtly higher than that of regular inner disciples.

"Elder Gu is inside. He just finished refining the medicinal energy from his earlier dose," the attendant said with a smile. "You’ve arrived at the perfect time."

"Thank you."

Li Zhengjing stepped inside as the attendant quietly closed the gate behind him.

Proceeding forward, he saw an elderly man lying on a sickbed—frail, his complexion sickly green, his aura feeble and dispirited.

"So you are Li Zhengjing, the one who slew the Venom King Xin Xuan?"

"Indeed, Elder."

Li Zhengjing raised his head and met the elder’s gaze, keeping his internal energy steady. The spirit stones he had swallowed earlier, previously encased in his internal energy, now dissolved, releasing their spiritual energy to be absorbed entirely by the golden page.

And upon the golden page, information about Elder Gu began to unfold.
