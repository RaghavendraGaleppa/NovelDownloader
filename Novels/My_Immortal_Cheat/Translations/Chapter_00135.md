# Chapter 135: Bad News Keeps Coming

It now seemed that the people who had attacked Zhou Tian’s mother back then must have been from a major power in the Star Realm.

Before Zhou Tian could speak, Zhou Changsheng said, "This matter is truly a long story, and in many places, it's hard to say who was right or wrong. The specific reasons will be told to you by Zhou Yi later; I, this old fellow, won't say too much."

The question Zhou Tian was about to ask was swallowed back. Since Zhou Changsheng didn't want to elaborate, there was nothing he could do.

"All these recent troubles were stirred up by those ancient gods from the God Realm. I don't know why they're so fixated on this ruined place, brewing for so many years, determined to reclaim it."

Zhou Tian's heart stirred, and he spoke, "Is it because of the emergence of the 'Mandate of Heaven'? I once learned from the leader of a divine cult that the condition to become the King of Gods is to obtain the 'Mandate of Heaven'."

Zhou Changsheng showed no surprise. "We've also speculated about this. In ancient times, the complete Mandate of Heaven of the Nine Realms possessed unfathomable power and was a necessary condition to become the strongest in a realm. But with the shattering of the world, the Mandate of Heaven also lost much of its power. We didn't expect the Mandate of Heaven of the God-Forsaken Land to still possess such miraculous functions."

"Oh, she also said that the King of Gods' faith *is* the gods themselves. This reopening of the Pantheon is to release enough divine positions. One of the goals of those ancient gods might be to become the King of Gods," Zhou Tian continued. These major powers were well-informed, and there was little they didn't know, but Zhou Tian still didn't let go of a single detail.

"Oh?" Zhou Changsheng's eyes gleamed with golden light; this was indeed something he hadn't known. "So that's it. I wondered why those gods were willing to pay such a high price to unleash the power of the Pantheon. I thought they were truly naive enough to believe we'd just let them spread their faith."

"We still have too little research into this path; many things remain unclear."

Having said that, Zhou Changsheng turned his gaze to Zhou Tian. "You can't absorb spiritual energy, can you? Have you ever thought about trying this path? I know you have your own fortuitous encounters, but having more paths is always a good thing."

This suggestion made Zhou Tian slightly stunned. To be honest, he had never really thought about it. Although he had gone to the Pantheon with Mu Su and entertained thoughts of competing for a divine position, he had never considered trying the path of faith, mainly because it was too troublesome.

One would need to spread faith, respond to believers' prayers, and maintain their status—it was simply too much hassle. Moreover, because of his past life, he wasn't too comfortable with a group of people kneeling before him, shouting "My Lord," always getting the strange feeling it was some community outreach program.

"Perhaps not," Zhou Tian declined.

"We'll see then. Anyway, we'll have to go to the Pantheon eventually. We'll definitely seize quite a few divine positions. These are genuine, orthodox divine positions from the God Realm. I want to see how they differ from what we've cobbled together ourselves, and from those wandering ancient Holy Spirits." Zhou Changsheng said. They had also experimented with mimicking the God Realm's path, but their results always fell far short of the God Realm's deities. When the Pantheon opened, they would certainly go to join the fun.

Zhou Tian nodded and said no more. Many of his doubts had been resolved by Zhou Changsheng. For a moment, he couldn't think of anything else. After some thought, he said, "Grandfather, if there's nothing else, I'll take my leave."

Zhou Changsheng waved his hand. "I didn't call you for anything else, just to inform you of these matters. Now that it's settled, you can go. I also need to go discuss with a few fellow Daoists soon."

Zhou Tian bowed, preparing to leave. Just as he reached the door, he suddenly remembered something and turned around, saying, "Grandfather, that fellow Zhang Yi is still missing. I'm afraid he..."

Zhou Changsheng knew the name Zhang Yi and said calmly, "It doesn't matter. We weren't planning to rescue him anyway. As long as his soul fire exists, the Old Ancestor can just revive him by consuming some soul fire afterward. Going to that place would likely invite an ambush."

"Now, the God-Forsaken Land is enveloped by something ineffable, preventing contact with the outside world. The Heavenly Pass is also blocked by something, with no activity. I can't even know if he's dead or alive."

Zhou Tian was dumbfounded. How could a casual remark from him lead to so much bad news? Did this mean they were now isolated on an island?

"You don't need to worry too much. My Nine Provinces has weathered greater catastrophes than this. Several Heavenly Venerates have even fallen before, yet we still pulled through. Those Heavenly Venerates must have made contingency plans." Zhou Changsheng seemed either very confident or simply unconcerned.

"I'm really not worried," Zhou Tian answered honestly. He was only worried about the Zhou family; as for himself, he truly wasn't worried at all.

"Good that you're not worried," Zhou Changsheng chuckled, not taking the current situation to heart in the slightest.

Zhou Tian didn't say anything more, afraid that Zhou Changsheng might suddenly blurt out, "Son, actually our Nine Provinces is gone. Now it's just us old, weak, sick, and disabled folks."

As for Zhang Yi, he could only hope for the best.

***

Leaving the room, Zhou Tian went to look for Tian Ling. He had just started talking to Tian Ling when Zhou Changsheng called him away, and he hadn't had a good moment with her yet.

This was the Zhou family's main garrison city, with no other people present, more like a military base. All the trading posts were in the nearby satellite cities.

...

Tian Ling and Zhou Tian walked side by side. The roads here were paved with grayish-blue stone bricks, ancient and very wide, designed to accommodate massive exotic beasts at times.

"I'm already at the Dharma Aspect Realm," Tian Ling said, her eyes crystal clear, her black hair gently swaying, a faint fragrance wafting into Zhou Tian's nose.

"Our Tian Ling is the most amazing!" Zhou Tian exclaimed with a hint of exaggeration. Although he had lasted thirty seconds against the old monster Saint Devil, compliments were still necessary, right?

Tian Ling's pretty face flushed slightly, and she rolled her eyes playfully at Zhou Tian. "You're all talk!"

"Talk? Tian Ling, how did you learn to be so suggestive? Don't you know if my tongue is slippery or not?" Zhou Tian keenly seized on her keyword, promptly retaliating.

Tian Ling glared at him, annoyed and embarrassed. "Nonsense!"

"Don't hang out with that crazy woman Liu Yan anymore. You never used to glare at people before." Zhou Tian spoke ill of Liu Yan, convinced she was the one corrupting his Tian Ling.

"If Sister Liu knew you were speaking ill of her, she'd be fuming!" Tian Ling smiled, her eyes curving into crescent moons, sparkling like the moon itself. Two dimples appeared on her delicate face, and her laughter was as leisurely as a bell echoing in a quiet valley.

"Sooner or later, I'll make Zhou Zui take care of her," Zhou Tian pouted.

"Zhou Zui wouldn't dare," Tian Ling retorted. She had learned quite a lot during this time.
