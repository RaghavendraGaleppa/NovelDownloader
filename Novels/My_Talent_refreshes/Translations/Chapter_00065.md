# Chapter 65: Verdant Wood Sword Art  

Chu Ning arrived at the Spiritual Plantation Hall’s training ground, where He Changyou was indeed still waiting for him.  

However, He Changyou wasn’t in the main training area but in a small room beside it.  

"Greetings, Elder He." Chu Ning cupped his hands and bowed slightly.  

He Changyou nodded slightly, glanced at Chu Ning, and got straight to the point:  

"Has the Talisman Pavilion already taught you the art of talisman-making?"  

Recalling Zhuang Yunde’s earlier words, Chu Ning decided to test the waters and answered truthfully:  

"Yes, Elder Liao of the Talisman Pavilion gave me a foundational manual on talisman-making, passed down within the pavilion. Additionally, he provided me with a mid-grade talisman brush, some ink, and talisman paper. He also promised to teach me the methods of spiritual talismans once I’ve mastered the basics."  

Chu Ning wore an expression of earnest respect as he spoke. When he mentioned the "methods of spiritual talismans," He Changyou’s eyes flickered slightly.  

Chu Ning continued without pause:  

"On top of that, he gave me five talismans—four mid-grade primary talismans, one of which is even a high-grade primary talisman. Oh, Elder Liao also instructed me to request more materials if I run out and to seek guidance from senior brothers if I have any questions."  

As he finished, Chu Ning allowed a hint of joy to show on his face, like a naive disciple who had just received a great reward.  

Of course, he genuinely felt that way. But thanks to Zhuang Yunde’s advice, he exaggerated his reaction slightly.  

He Changyou listened quietly, his eyes glinting faintly. Once Chu Ning finished, he spoke calmly:  

"Elder Liao has treated you quite well, even promising to teach you the methods of spiritual talismans. I was planning to ask for some resources on your behalf, but it seems unnecessary now. The Talisman Pavilion clearly values your talent."  

Chu Ning detected nothing unusual in He Changyou’s tone. The elder continued:  

"Since joining the sect, you’ve been a disciple of the Spiritual Plantation Hall. Over the past year, I’ve observed your progress. Though your spiritual root aptitude is lacking, your compatibility with wood-element techniques and spells is remarkable. If you focus on cultivating wood-element techniques, you could achieve considerable success."  

He paused briefly before adding:  

"Truth be told, I had already considered nurturing you as a key disciple after seeing your performance in the promotion assessment for the Third District. The talisman competition only confirmed my decision. According to sect rules, since you’ve been acknowledged by both halls, you are now qualified to become an outer disciple. You won’t need to return to the Third District for now."  

---  

Chu Ning’s expression shifted slightly. He hadn’t expected that before receiving the benefits Zhuang Yunde had hinted at, he would first be told to stop farming.  

Although he had already obtained the art of talisman-making—which would likely bring him decent income and resources—Chu Ning hadn’t forgotten his most important advantage: the Yin Wood Spiritual Body!  

This innate gift allowed him to accelerate his cultivation speed by tending to spiritual plants and using the Verdant Wood Spring Technique. He had no intention of giving up such a shortcut.  

Not being allowed to farm? That was unacceptable!  

So he quickly spoke up:  

"Elder He, I’ve only just begun learning spiritual plant cultivation. I’d like to continue farming."  

"Who said you wouldn’t be farming?" He Changyou gave him a puzzled look.  

"I’m arranging for you to live in the outer disciple quarters, where the spiritual energy is denser and more beneficial for your cultivation. As for farming, we’ll see how things go in the Third District. In about a month, some disciples will be leaving on assignments, freeing up their plots. I’ll assign you better-quality fields then. Once you reach late-stage Qi Refining, you can apply to farm in the Second District."  

Hearing this, Chu Ning relaxed slightly. The "month" He Changyou mentioned likely referred to disciples like Zhuang Yunde leaving for that mysterious mission.  

"For the next month, focus on cultivating at your residence. Improve your cultivation base, refine your spells, and study talisman-making. Once your new residence and fields are arranged, I’ll inform you."  

He Changyou then looked at Chu Ning again.  

"The Talisman Pavilion has rewarded you, so our Spiritual Plantation Hall won’t be stingy either. What would you like?"  

Zhuang Yunde had been right.  

That was the only thought in Chu Ning’s mind. He had assumed that being allowed to live in the outer disciple quarters and receiving better fields later were already generous benefits. He hadn’t expected additional rewards.  

Chu Ning allowed a flicker of delight to show before pretending to think deeply.  

After a moment, he raised his head.  

"Elder, so far, I’ve only learned basic cultivation techniques for common spiritual plants. The spells I’ve practiced are mostly auxiliary ones for farming. The only offensive and defensive spells I know are the Thorn Technique and Vine Armor Technique. Since I’m now an outer disciple, I wonder if I could learn more about other spiritual plants and spells."  

His words were tactful, but He Changyou understood his underlying request. After a brief pause, he reached into his storage pouch.  

---  

Two jade slips appeared in his hand, and Chu Ning’s eyes immediately locked onto them.  

He Changyou handed the first one to Chu Ning.  

"*Compendium of Spiritual Plants*. This records cultivation methods and uses for most common spiritual plants, including knowledge about rarer herbs. Most entries include planting and nurturing techniques."  

Chu Ning eagerly accepted it.  

Zhuang Yunde had previously given him a jade slip with information on spiritual plants, but it was mostly descriptions with only a few cultivation methods. The one He Changyou provided was clearly more comprehensive.  

Next, He Changyou picked up the second jade slip and handed it over.  

"This is a wood-element offensive spell—a high-grade primary technique called the *Verdant Wood Sword Art*. It’s particularly suited for disciples who’ve practiced the Verdant Wood Spring Technique."  

Chu Ning’s eyes gleamed.  

He had been wanting to learn a more powerful offensive spell. While the Thorn Technique had restraining effects, its offensive power was too weak.  

Previously, he had obtained a mid-grade primary spell called the Golden Sword Technique from the bearded man, but after struggling with it for a while without progress, he had abandoned it.  

Now, He Changyou was offering a high-grade primary offensive spell—this was beyond his expectations.  

Chu Ning quickly accepted it and bowed deeply. "Thank you, Elder!"  

His gratitude was sincere.  

Though Zhuang Yunde had hinted at this outcome, receiving such valuable items from He Changyou still filled him with joy.  

"Go back and rest. I’ll notify you once the sect makes further arrangements."  

With He Changyou’s dismissal, Chu Ning expressed his thanks once more before leaving.  

He had gained many valuable things today—it was time to digest them properly.
