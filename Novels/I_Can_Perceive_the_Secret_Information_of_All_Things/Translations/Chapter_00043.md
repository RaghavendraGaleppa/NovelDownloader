# Chapter 43: The Immortal Master's Apprentice

The bear demon disguised as an immortal master was like a candy that had fallen right into Xiao Ji's pocket—sweetening his heart with delight.

Xiao Ji felt this was an effortless windfall. Among the materials he needed for his Foundation Establishment, this bear's gallbladder not only met the requirements but exceeded them.

"Taoist Xiao, have you thought about what we discussed earlier?" Song Yuanbao asked anxiously beside him.

"What was that again?" Xiao Ji feigned ignorance.

"Joyful Pavilion," Song Yuanbao nudged the Taoist lightly with his shoulder, lowering his voice. "My treat."

Quite generous.

Xiao Ji's gaze shifted away from the sedan chair. Since this bear demon planned to stay in Willow Town for two days—setting up a stage to test qualifications and recruit disciples—it wouldn't escape anytime soon. There was still time to observe.

"But right now, I'm afraid I can't leave," Xiao Ji said with a troubled expression. "Because... I need to report something."

Song Yuanbao: "..."

This took the constable by surprise. They had been chatting just fine—why the sudden urge to report?

Xiao Ji pulled the constable aside and shared his suspicions about the so-called immortal master, explaining that the man was likely a demon in disguise.

"If this person is truly a demon, then he's no immortal master. His promises of apprenticeship are nothing but lies," Xiao Ji whispered. "This group is most likely a human trafficking ring—not a small case."

Indeed, if true, this could be the biggest case Song Yuanbao had ever encountered.

"Taoist Xiao, are you certain? If the immortal master isn’t a demon and we offend such a powerful figure, Willow Town will suffer the consequences," Song Yuanbao hesitated, unable to believe that the dignified immortal master could be a mere beast. The man's demeanor and entourage were far too sophisticated for a simple-minded demon.

If they were mistaken, the immortal master's wrath could bring calamity upon Willow Town. Many powerful figures held petty grudges. Offend them, and they might summon hailstorms in summer, frost in the fields, or floods in winter—just out of spite. 

And if truly enraged? Historical records spoke of earthquakes unleashed in retaliation.

But Taoist Xiao was the person Song Yuanbao trusted most. If he said so, there must be good reason.

"Then I’ll postpone Joyful Pavilion," Song Yuanbao said firmly. "What do you need me to do?"

"Just ensure the magistrate is convinced and the reward is secured quickly," Xiao Ji replied with equal determination. "Leave the rest to me."

So, when you say 'report,' you're just reserving the reward in advance, huh? Song Yuanbao studied Xiao Ji's confident face. "I’ve always been quick with paperwork."

Two days later, at the square beneath Willow Town’s clock tower.

The bear demon had set up a stage for its apprentice recruitment test.

Anyone who passed the test needed only to pay one tael of silver to be accepted into Mount Wuliang’s sect. Those who barely passed could still join as outer disciples.

To dispel doubts, the fake immortal master occasionally displayed flashes of mystical light. He even invited people to strike him with weapons to prove his supernatural resilience.

After the performance came the real test—a standard scam tactic. The author himself had once lost twenty coins to a conman demonstrating "Iron Sand Palm" before selling laundry powder.

The trick was simple: Shatter a few rocks with bare hands, awe the crowd, then lead them into the trap. By the time victims realized the deception, fear of those rock-splitting palms kept them silent.

"Our immortal master descends to recruit disciples for the first time in a millennium!" a young acolyte announced from the stage. "Only ninety-nine spots available. Testing begins now!"

Beneath the clock tower, townsfolk gathered with their children, all hoping their little ones would prove extraordinary. The test was rudimentary—just touching a stone that emitted different colored lights.

Each glow prompted the acolyte to loudly announce the result:

"Qualified for outer sect cultivation!"  
"Grade A—eligible for personal guidance!"  
"Grade B—accepted as an inner disciple!"  
"Elder, please don’t waste our time."

Qualified candidates remained onstage; the rest were dismissed. Some elderly, convinced of their latent talent from "dreams of immortality," tried to join but were brusquely turned away.

Xiao Ji observed carefully. The traffickers exclusively selected healthy children under ten years old. True to their word, they stopped at exactly ninety-nine recruits—all within half a shichen.

"Taoist, should we strike now?" Song Yuanbao glanced at his hidden men. The perfect moment had arrived.

Glory was within reach—how could he not be eager?

If Xiao Ji was right about these demons, Song Yuanbao couldn’t let them leave Willow Town. He had reported to the magistrate, who hesitated, fearing to offend an immortal master. Yet if this was a scam, the abduction of children would be unforgivable.

Caught in a dilemma, the magistrate considered summoning the county’s Demon Suppression Bureau—but time was too short. Professional scammers planned meticulously, accounting for local customs and geography.

Ultimately, the magistrate decided to trust the Taoist from Primordial Spirit Temple. After all, Xiao Ji had solved cases like a deity—this time would likely be no exception. Discreetly, backup was deployed among the crowd, awaiting Song Yuanbao’s signal.

And Song Yuanbao awaited Xiao Ji’s word.

"Don’t you want to know where they’re taking these children?" Xiao Ji said. "We must eradicate the root."

This reminded Song Yuanbao of the Tu family, once-powerful gamblers who sought to seize the temple’s land. Their patriarch, Tu Mantun, had ultimately lost his head at Dragon Soar County’s execution ground. Officially, his crime was harboring demonic cultivators—but everyone knew the true reason was crossing Primordial Spirit Temple.

Coincidence? Unlikely.

Thus, the temple’s Taoist, though handsome, was ruthless beneath the surface. Once targeted by him, one’s secrets unraveled completely.

Xiao Ji remained expressionless, though he sensed the constable’s thoughts. To salvage his image slightly, he added, "Think of those kidnapped children. Without rescue, their fate would be tragic."

"Right! These traffickers are bold—they’ve surely abducted others," Song Yuanbao said, enlightened, now seeing Xiao Ji in an almost saintly light. "We must uproot them entirely and save all previous victims."

"Exactly," Xiao Ji’s gaze returned to the stage. "Its gallbladder isn’t just large—it’s delectably plump."
