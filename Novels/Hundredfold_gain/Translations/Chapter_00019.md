# Chapter 19: The Spark of Inspiration

As night fell, Qi Chuan sat cross-legged on his bed, swallowing a Qi Condensation Pill before circulating the Evergreen Technique. He gradually refined the gathered spiritual energy and the pill's medicinal power into his own spiritual power.

[You circulated the Evergreen Technique, absorbing spiritual energy and refining medicinal power into spiritual power. Triggered 6x critical effect—gained sixfold rewards. Your total spiritual power increased slightly.]

After completing a major cycle, Qi Chuan opened his eyes to see these words floating before him. Sensing his body, he noticed his spiritual power had indeed grown slightly more abundant. At this rate, reaching the peak of Qi Refinement's third layer would only be a matter of time.

However, with only five Qi Condensation Pills left—one per month—they would be exhausted in five months. This was far from enough. Thus, he needed to undertake some clan missions to supplement his resources.

Yet, whether he chose safer internal clan tasks or slightly riskier external ones, they would all consume time that could otherwise be spent cultivating. But this was unavoidable—to compete for the inner sect disciple quota, he had no choice.

Setting aside these thoughts, Qi Chuan calmed his mind and continued circulating the Evergreen Technique. After some time, a faint stinging sensation spread through his meridians, signaling he had reached his daily cultivation limit. Reluctantly, he shifted his focus to practicing spells.

With hand seals and incantations, a crimson fireball larger than half a fist slowly rose from his palm, radiating scorching heat. Moments later, Qi Chuan dispersed the fireball, and another line of text appeared:

[You successfully cast Fireball Technique and maintained it for a period. Triggered 29x critical effect—gained twenty-ninefold rewards. Your proficiency in Fireball Technique improved slightly.]

Feeling his mastery of the Fireball Technique had indeed progressed, Qi Chuan diligently practiced other basic elemental spells as well—Water Arrow Technique and the like. Time flowed steadily amidst this dedicated cultivation.

One year and four months later...

On a spirit herb field atop his private mountain peak, Qi Chuan bent over, diligently tending to the plants. Around him, under the sunlight, spirit herbs swayed gently in the breeze. A dewdrop, crystal-clear like a gem, slid from a leaf tip, shimmering brilliantly as it fell.

[You diligently tended spirit plants for half an hour. Triggered 2x critical effect—gained twofold rewards. Your experience and skill in plant care improved slightly.]

Seeing these words, Qi Chuan smiled faintly but paid little attention. Instead, he straightened, gazing into the distance with an inexplicable unease stirring in his heart.

"Success or failure hinges on today," he murmured to himself.

Over this past year, Qi Chuan had devoted himself entirely to cultivation, occasionally taking on clan missions—both safe internal tasks and carefully selected low-risk external ones—to earn contribution points, all exchanged for Qi Condensation Pills to accelerate his spiritual power accumulation.

Now, at last, his cultivation had reached the peak of Qi Refinement's third layer!

Yet upon achieving this milestone, Qi Chuan had deliberately paused his cultivation, spending half an hour tending the spirit fields to calm his mind and relieve pressure. The reason? The crucial mid-stage bottleneck.

Breaking through would elevate him to Qi Refinement's fourth layer, qualifying him to compete for Moonbreeze Sect's inner sect disciple quota. Failure would dash those hopes—after all, the Transmission Elder's descendant, with fourth-grade spiritual roots, would likely reach at least third-layer peak by selection day.

Faced with two candidates of the same age and cultivation level—one with inferior eighth-grade roots and the other with fourth-grade—the choice was obvious. The inner sect quota would never go to Qi Chuan. At best, he could compete for an outer sect position, lagging a step behind.

Though with his hundredfold critical effect, even as an outer sect disciple, diligent cultivation might eventually secure him an inner sect spot. But direct entry was undoubtedly preferable.

Yet Qi Chuan's current unease wasn't solely about the bottleneck or the quota—it centered on the hundredfold critical effect and its implications for his future cultivation path.

Today, he would attempt his breakthrough, testing whether the critical effect applied to bottleneck breakthroughs. If it proved useless, his cultivation journey would face countless obstacles ahead. How many bottlenecks stood between him and immortality? Without the critical effect's aid, his inferior eighth-grade roots would make progress agonizingly slow.

But if it worked... his path would smooth considerably.

"Speculation is pointless. Only experimentation will reveal the truth," Qi Chuan resolved inwardly.

After a deep breath, he returned to his room and settled onto his bed. Rather than immediately circulating the Evergreen Technique, he first stilled his mind, achieving perfect tranquility before closing his eyes to begin.

As the technique activated, his peak third-layer spiritual power flowed through his meridians along established pathways—a standard major cycle. Having no prior experience with mid-stage breakthroughs, Qi Chuan could only grope his way forward.

Yet as his spiritual power fully mobilized, he faintly perceived something—a vague intuition about how to breach the bottleneck. But this sensation was frustratingly elusive. Rashly attempting a breakthrough in this state might succeed by sheer luck, but such recklessness usually backfired, resulting in failed breakthroughs, physical and spiritual damage, or even regressed cultivation and diminished potential.

"Relying on luck for immortality? The Heavenly Dao would swiftly correct that notion," Qi Chuan mused wryly.

He knew poorer spiritual roots meant tougher bottlenecks—legend stated those with superior roots faced no barriers until Golden Core formation. With his lowly eighth-grade roots, this faint inspiration might be misleading or entirely false. Thus, he maintained the technique's circulation without attempting a breakthrough, focusing solely on clarifying that elusive feeling.

After completing a full major cycle, his spiritual power returned to his dantian like swallows to their nest—and with it, that wisp of inspiration vanished completely.

Qi Chuan opened his eyes helplessly. Despite his focused efforts, he'd gained no tangible insight into breaking through to mid-stage Qi Refinement.

"Is this the limit of eighth-grade spiritual roots? How long must I remain stuck at third-layer peak?" he wondered bleakly.

Just then, his eyes sharpened as new text materialized before him:

[You circulated the Evergreen Technique through a major cycle, attempting to grasp the inspiration for breaking through to mid-stage Qi Refinement. Triggered 72x critical effect—gained seventy-twofold rewards. You successfully captured a wisp of breakthrough inspiration.]
