#76, Descending the Mountain!

The scene before Li Zhiming was the most shocking he had ever witnessed in his life. The cruelty of cultivators far exceeded his imagination. The elders of the Seven Mystic Gate sect had joined forces to attack Su Zongguang, who sat calmly, with a fierce intent to behead the leader of the Sea Sand Gang, who had dared to enter their sect's sacred grounds alone.

Behind Su Zongguang, the thirteen martial arts masters he had recruited with heavy gold had rushed forward to block the top-level masters of the Seven Mystic Gate sect. At the same time, the sound of killing and shouting had finally reached the top of the mountain. Li Zhiming's expression changed slightly as he looked around. The entire mountain was now ablaze, with flames visible everywhere.

It was clear that the Sea Sand Gang was taking advantage of the situation to attack the sect. What Li Zhiming didn't know was that the Sea Sand Gang had launched a simultaneous attack on all the branches of the Seven Mystic Gate sect, including the nine major peaks, with over 200,000 people.

As the attackers surrounded the mountain, the Golden Light Abbot sat cross-legged on the ground, a cold smile on his face. With a subtle gesture, the gray flying sword began to move, cutting down anyone it touched, leaving them either dead or severely injured.

On the other side, three enraged elders of the Seven Mystic Gate sect, their faces red with anger, lifted a massive bronze cauldron that was over three times the height of an adult male and weighed several tons. With a mighty roar, they swung the cauldron towards the Golden Light Abbot.

The impact was earth-shaking, causing the ground to tremble. However, the Golden Light Abbot remained unmoved, even as the ground beneath him cracked and his body was partially buried. He merely let out a cold laugh, his eyes still closed, as he continued to control the gray flying sword.

Li Zhiming felt a tug on his sleeve and turned to see Han Li's worried face. "They can't be saved," Han Li said. "We have to leave, now!"

Li Zhiming hesitated, "But if we leave, they'll be doomed. You're a mid-stage Qi Refiner, can't you think of a way to help him?"

Han Li shook his head, "The object he's using is called the Golden Light Spell, it's impossible to break through with mere mortal strength. And the other object, the Talisman Sword, is virtually indestructible. We can't do anything, we have to leave."

As they spoke, more and more elders fell to the Golden Light Abbot's sword. Li Zhiming knew they had to escape. They made their way down the mountain, but the paths were filled with the sounds of killing and shouting.

Han Li, who had cultivated the Long Spring Decree for six years, remained calm and alert, thinking of ways to protect Li Zhiming. As they reached a point about 300 meters down the mountain, they were blocked by several Sea Sand Gang members wielding long knives.

One of them, a seasoned martial artist, sneered at Li Zhiming and Han Li, "Hey, we've got kids coming down here. Zhang, you're right, guarding this spot was a good idea."

Suddenly, one of the gang members recognized Li Zhiming, "Wait, this is the Seven Mystic Gate's Little Divine Doctor! The gang leader specifically wants him alive, don't harm him!"

The martial artist's expression changed, and he approached Li Zhiming with caution. Li Zhiming didn't hesitate; he drew his sword and charged forward, unleashing a swift and silent strike.

The martial artist, despite being a top-notch fighter, was caught off guard by Li Zhiming's sudden attack. His eyes widened in shock as Li Zhiming's sword hurtled towards him.
