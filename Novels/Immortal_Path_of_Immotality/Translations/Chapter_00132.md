# Chapter 131: Overnight Fortune  

Lin Shan used the "Seven Arrows of the Nailhead Book" to curse the Soul-Devouring Worm into a state of complete incapacitation. Once it was forced to crawl out of his body, he promptly crushed it underfoot. Just as the clock struck midnight, marking the start of a new day, his curse count refreshed.  

Now, with no Soul-Devouring Worm inside him and no Turtle Sage watching over him—and with the joint law enforcement team from the three demonic sects arriving the next day—Lin Shan felt his courage surge. He thought it might be a good idea to curse the young Foundation Establishment cultivator while also peeking over to check on Turtle Sage's injuries.  

But what he saw shocked him—Turtle Sage was already dead.  

*Damn, this young Foundation Establishment cultivator is something else, keeping his master's death a secret!*  

Unbeknownst to Lin Shan, it was actually his own actions that had killed Turtle Sage. By destroying the Soul-Devouring Worm, he had triggered a backlash that sent the old man into a fatal qi deviation. Mistakenly believing the disciple had been hiding the truth, Lin Shan wondered if the antidotes he had been receiving were pre-prepared.  

*Or maybe this guy can control the Soul-Devouring Worm himself?*  

While speculating, Lin Shan continued firing arrows one after another, multitasking between spying and revenge.  

*Neither Turtle Sage nor his disciple were good people—they seized my cave without hesitation and nearly ruined my future. There’s no way I’m letting them off easy.*  

"But if Turtle Sage is already dead, do I still need to expose him tomorrow?"  

"Why don’t I just go over there tonight and claim his inheritance?"  

"If I wait until tomorrow, those Golden Core demonic cultivators might show up, and I might not even get a drop of the spoils."  

The more he thought about it, the more he realized this was a heaven-sent opportunity!  

*As they say, fortune and misfortune are intertwined. Just days ago, I was trapped in despair, but now the tables have turned, and an unimaginable opportunity lies before me—the lifelong wealth of a late-stage Golden Core cultivator!*  

He recalled the grand gathering in the East Sea years ago, where countless aristocratic families and sects had presented treasures to Turtle Sage. Back then, he and his sworn brother Lin Fan had marveled at the rare artifacts they had never even heard of.  

*Who would’ve thought that three years later, all of it would be right in front of me, ripe for the taking?*  

As for the mid-Foundation Establishment disciple? Lin Shan smirked. It wasn’t arrogance—he just didn’t see the guy as a threat. *You’ve already taken three of my sect’s signature curses—how much strength do you even have left?*  

Through the void channel of the straw effigy, he could see the young man’s miserable state—utterly wretched.  

But what surprised Lin Shan this time was that the manifestation of the curse was different from the previous three.  

It wasn’t the eerie giant eyeball that had appeared on the well-dressed middle-aged man’s forehead, nor the tentacled monstrosity that had plagued Bear Mountain’s master, nor even the antennae and compound eyes that had sprouted from the Soul-Devouring Worm.  

This time, it was a snow-white skull.  

And not just any skull—it was swaying unsteadily, its jaw clacking open and shut with a bone-chilling *click-clack*, while a sinister green ghost fire burned fiercely inside its cranium.  

*Is that… a soul entity?*  

Lin Shan didn’t hesitate for long. Though he would normally steer clear of such eerie things, this was about Turtle Sage’s inheritance. Even if it meant risking his life, he had to seize this chance.  

*When you’ve known the pain of poverty, and someone offers you a shot at overnight wealth, would you say no?*  

After firing three consecutive arrows, Lin Shan swiftly packed up his tools, dashed out of his cave, and took to the skies on his flying sword.  

---  

By now, the young Foundation Establishment cultivator was unrecognizable. His hair had fallen out, his body was covered in scorched black patches, and he was desperately clutching the skull that had sprouted from his right shoulder, trying to tear it off.  

Strangely, the skull—born from the curse—could actually speak. Its jaw clattered as it screeched, trying to reason with the young man.  

*"Click-clack! Calm down, young one!"*  

*"We are one—don’t turn on yourself!"*  

*"Clack-clack! We’re like brothers! Why harm kin?"*  

*"From the same root we spring—why hasten the fire’s sting?"*  

The skull even resorted to poetry in its panic, but the young man wasn’t having it.  

After years of enduring hardship, he had finally been on the verge of inheriting his master’s legacy—only to be cursed three times in a row, reduced to this monstrous state. Such a drastic reversal would drive anyone to madness.  

And now this skull kept babbling nonsense about being his "older brother," promising to "protect him," and calling itself the "Black Skull Demon Monarch."  

The young man was on the verge of insanity. He just wanted to rip this abomination out of his body.  

*"Shut up! Stop clacking those damn bones!"*  

With a furious wrench, he snapped the skull’s neck clean off.  

*"Crack!"*  

The skull’s ghostly flames flickered in shock.  

*"I’ve been forcibly ejected from my host already? This guy’s strength is unreal!"*  

The young man hurled the skull to the ground with all his might.  

*"Clang-clang-clang! Roll-roll-roll~"*  

*"Ow! Stop! That hurts!"*  

The skull tumbled across the floor, its green flames swaying dizzily.  

*"Wait, listen to me—"*  

Before it could finish, the chamber doors burst open, and moonlight spilled inside. A white-robed youth stepped in.  

Both the young man and the skull froze, staring at the newcomer in stunned silence.  

Lin Shan, revisiting the scene of his earlier torment, was equally taken aback.  

*What the hell? A talking skull? It didn’t say anything when I cursed him!*  

But then things got even weirder. The skull, which had just been calling the young man "brother," suddenly hopped over to Lin Shan.  

*"Click-clack! If I’m not mistaken, you’re the one who opened the Curse Gate, right?"*  

*"This Demon Monarch has accepted your summoning, projecting an avatar into this world."*  

*"Kid, this guy’s already been crippled by me—go on, beat him up!"*  

*"Once this is done, you’ll need to offer me—"*  

*"Smack!"*  

Lin Shan slapped the skull away without hesitation.  

*"What kind of nonsense is this? Get lost!"*  

His eyes were locked onto Turtle Sage’s lifeless body—and the storage bracelet on his wrist. This was the lifetime accumulation of a cultivator just one step away from Nascent Soul!  

The young Foundation Establishment cultivator was dumbfounded. After three years of struggle, just as he was about to reap the rewards, this brat waltzed in to steal everything?  

*"Have you forgotten about the Soul-Devouring Worm inside you? Do you want to live or—"*  

*"Smack!"*  

Lin Shan backhanded him aside.  

*"Still trying to threaten me at this point?"*  

Without another word, he strode over to Turtle Sage’s corpse and yanked off the storage bracelet. Sensing the fading spiritual restrictions—now weakened by the owner’s death—his heart raced with excitement.  

*"I’m finally about to strike it rich!"*
