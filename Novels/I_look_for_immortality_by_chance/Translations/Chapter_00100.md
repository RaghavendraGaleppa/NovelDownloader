# Chapter 100: Golden Star Grass and Dao Unity Lotus Seed!

"Gu Yuan! Gu Yuan! Damn that Gu Yuan!"

In the mountain forest, Bian Chuyao wielded a peculiar golden flame whip, lashing out at the attacking beasts while cursing incessantly.

Born into a prominent family, she had lived a life of luxury since childhood. With exceptional talent and smooth cultivation progress, she had developed an unflappable composure and gentle demeanor, always presenting herself as kind and amiable.

Even when scheming, she treated others with sincerity, generously offering precious pills and herbs to make people willingly work for her.

She had thought such actions would be enough to win hearts and gain respect from her fellow disciples in the Dao Academy.

But she never expected to encounter Gu Yuan!

After consuming piles of her precious pills and herbs, he reached the ninth level of Qi Refining in just one month. Yet before contributing anything, he ran off alone!

Running away was bad enough, but he even resorted to underhanded tactics, luring nearly all the nearby beasts toward her.

Was he using bandit methods on her now?

"Damn it! Damn it! If only we could use spiritual artifacts in this secret realm, I'd pull out my Flame Barrier and burn him to ashes!"

Seeing the endless waves of beasts around her, Bian Chuyao's beautiful face twisted with anger, her usual calm and gentleness nowhere to be found.

"Whack! Whack! Whack!"

She continuously raised her golden flame whip, activating its seals to mercilessly strike the beasts before her, as if imagining them to be Gu Yuan.

"Evil Gu Yuan! Wicked Gu Yuan!"

"Villain! Absolute villain!"

Several small spirits echoed her outrage, cursing Gu Yuan alongside her.

"Whoosh—"

But just then, a dense fog suddenly rose in the forest. Within the mist, raindrops fell like swords, clinking with a chilling, murderous intent.

"Thud! Thud! Thud!"

In an instant, all the beasts around Bian Chuyao collapsed dead on the ground.

Though more beasts still charged from afar, they couldn't pierce through the thick fog, stumbling blindly and even turning on each other in confusion.

"Junior Sister, my apologies for being late. Are you alright?"

From within the mist, Gu Yuan swiftly approached, landing beside Bian Chuyao with a concerned expression.

"Unlike Senior Brother with his bandit tricks, I merely managed to survive by luck!"

Bian Chuyao had always maintained a gentle and sweet demeanor, her eyes curved like crescent moons when she smiled.

But now, looking at Gu Yuan's face, she couldn't muster even a hint of a smile. Her brows furrowed coldly, her tone icy.

If not for the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit, she would have lashed out with her whip already.

Yet, she still needed Gu Yuan's help, so she forced herself to suppress her fury.

"Junior Sister, don't be angry. I know someone of your noble background must have countless methods—these mere beasts couldn't possibly trouble you."

This time, it was Gu Yuan's turn to coax her.

He showered her with sweet words, trying to smooth things over.

"Where did you go?"

Bian Chuyao remained unmoved, but she didn't bother pressing him further. After all, as long as they didn't openly clash, she had no real way to retaliate against Gu Yuan.

However, she was starting to understand him—this was a man utterly self-centered, bold, greedy, and skilled at deception. For him to abandon his facade and risk offending her to sneak off alone, there must have been something incredibly valuable.

She truly wanted to know—what treasure could outweigh the goodwill of a direct descendant of one of the Five Great Clans?

Hearing her question, Gu Yuan's mind raced. Without hesitation, he "honestly" took out two jade boxes.

"Just retrieving an elder's legacy."

"Since Junior Sister comes from a great clan and has vast knowledge, perhaps you could help me identify these two items?"

Naturally, Gu Yuan wouldn't mention the Golden Seal. But to mend their strained relationship, he needed to offer some explanation.

The spiritual materials in the jade boxes were the perfect excuse—they would let Bian Chuyao identify them for him, saving him the trouble of scouring through ancient texts.

The first box opened, revealing a peculiar jade-like grass dotted with golden star-like specks.

Bian Chuyao's indignant expression softened slightly.

"Golden Star Grass!"

"This is a rare spiritual material for Foundation Establishment. You should know that after breaking through Qi Refining, sword cultivators must imprint their sword techniques onto a spiritual sword, fusing their Dao patterns with the blade. From then on, the sword seal becomes both their method and their weapon—this is what sets sword cultivators apart from others."

"The quality of the spiritual sword is crucial for sword cultivators. This Golden Star Grass can draw upon the essence of metal and the power of the stars during the sword seal's formation, greatly enhancing the sword's quality and imbuing it with exceptional sharpness and spiritual energy."

"Any disciple of a major sect pursuing the sword path would seek such rare herbs to strengthen their blade."

"With this herb, you might barely attempt the path of a sword cultivator."

Bian Chuyao explained the grass's value, her anger diminishing somewhat.

For such a treasure, abandoning her could almost be justified.

But seeing Gu Yuan's expression of sudden realization, her resentment flared up again.

Damn it! She had fallen for his trick again, becoming his free appraiser!

"Junior Sister is truly knowledgeable and wise. Do you know what this seed might be?"

Gu Yuan thanked her sincerely before opening the second jade box.

Bian Chuyao was tempted to ignore him and refuse another free appraisal. But when the box opened, revealing a vibrant green seed radiating a faint glow, her expression changed dramatically.

"Dao Unity Lotus Seed!"

"Swish!"

Her mana surged as she reached out to snatch the seed.

But Gu Yuan was faster, swiftly storing it back in his storage pouch.

"Junior Sister, what's this? Trying to become a bandit now?"

Gu Yuan chuckled, though inwardly he was intensely curious—what was this seed that even a scion of a Golden Core family like Bian Chuyao would covet it?

"Pah! Who wants to be a bandit?!"

"But I diverted all those beasts for you, allowing you to retrieve this safely. Since I contributed, I deserve a share!"

Bian Chuyao glared at Gu Yuan, speaking rapidly.

"Didn't Junior Sister say that in this secret realm, you only wanted the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit, and everything else would be mine?"

Gu Yuan sighed helplessly.

"That was on the condition that we followed my route to Cloudmist Valley, with all other finds going to you. But you tricked me into covering for you while you obtained this! I deserve a portion!"

Bian Chuyao gritted her teeth.

For ordinary spiritual items, she wouldn't care. But this was exceptionally rare—and precisely what she needed. She truly wanted it.

"What exactly is this used for?"

Gu Yuan pressed.

Bian Chuyao took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down before explaining:

"You know that when cultivating a Dao seal, we rely on external Dao patterns for power."

"But Dao patterns aren't infinite. Over time, some materials bearing these patterns vanish from the world, making certain ancient seals impossible to recreate."

"Yet these ancient seals are often incredibly powerful."

"The Dao Unity Lotus Seed, once grown, produces several lotus seeds. These seeds possess the ability to 'unite Dao and beget all things'—they can replenish missing Dao patterns, allowing lost seals to be forged anew."

"Though the quality of your lotus isn't the best, if cultivated successfully, it could recreate ancient seals from the late Foundation Establishment stage!"

"Growing this lotus is extremely demanding—you won't manage it. But I can. Let me cultivate it for you, and we'll split the harvest later!"
