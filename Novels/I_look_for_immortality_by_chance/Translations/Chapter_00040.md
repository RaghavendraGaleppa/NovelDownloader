# Chapter 40: Refining Treasures, Seizing Jade, and the Arrival of Noble Families  

The first thing Gu Yuan saw upon opening the storage pouch was a golden compass.  

Crafted entirely from gold, the compass was extravagantly luxurious, its surface densely inscribed with intricate Daoist patterns of celestial stems and earthly branches, dazzling to the eye. As soon as Gu Yuan took it out, the spoon-shaped needle began spinning rapidly before firmly pointing toward the location of the Pearl King.  

"A Pearl-Seeking Compass?"  

"No wonder Kuang Mingsheng found the Pearl King before me—he actually had this treasure!"  

Gu Yuan suddenly understood.  

A pearl field was vast and boundless, making locating the Pearl King amidst the tides akin to finding a needle in a haystack. To expedite the search, some artifact refiners had devised the "Pearl-Seeking Compass," specifically designed to pinpoint the Pearl King's location.  

However, crafting such a compass was no easy feat. The cost rivaled that of a top-tier magical artifact, and the refinement process was exceedingly difficult. Even among noble families, few possessed one.  

Yet, Kuang Mingsheng had one in his possession.  

"Without this treasure, you might have lived a little longer."  

Shaking his head, Gu Yuan stored the compass away and continued rummaging through the storage pouch.  

Aside from miscellaneous items, the pouch contained thirty-six spirit stones and a translucent, crescent-shaped jade pendant. The jade was so clear that when held, the lines of one's palm could be seen through it.  

"Is this... Void-Concealing Jade?"  

As soon as Gu Yuan grasped the jade, he felt an inexplicable force enveloping his body. Slowly, his form vanished from the stone platform, just as Kuang Mingsheng's had earlier.  

*"In the western mountains, there exists a jade known as Void-Concealing. Holding it allows one to hide within the void, undetectable unless the observer's cultivation far surpasses the bearer's."*  

Gu Yuan recalled the description from the Scripture Repository.  

This was a rare treasure for Qi Refinement cultivators. With it, as long as the opponent's cultivation wasn't three minor realms higher, they wouldn't be able to detect the bearer's presence. It was perfect for stealth.  

However, the jade had one flaw: if the bearer attacked or exerted too much spiritual energy, their presence would be revealed. Thus, it was primarily used for covert movement.  

"Kuang Mingsheng used the compass to locate the Pearl King, then lured the Face-Spider and Red-Tailed Ape to fight Yang Yue and the others while he used the Void-Concealing Jade to sneak onto the stone platform."  

"But to avoid detection, he didn't dare use too much spiritual energy, slowing him down—just in time for me to arrive!"  

With these two treasures in hand, Gu Yuan instantly understood Kuang Mingsheng's plan.  

Admittedly, it was a clever scheme.  

First, secure the Pearl King and break through to the sixth layer of Qi Refinement.  

Once his cultivation improved, Kuang Mingsheng could then choose to either kill the Face-Spider and rescue Yang Yue's group—or eliminate them all.  

And if he encountered Gu Yuan later, he could overpower him with his higher cultivation, eliminating any threats to his peace of mind.  

"Fortunately, I had the Stone Liquid and knew the Pearl King's location. My speed was just fast enough—otherwise, he might have succeeded."  

Gu Yuan felt a pang of relief.  

This was the essence of warfare: speed was paramount.  

Whoever secured the Pearl King and advanced to the sixth layer of Qi Refinement first would gain the upper hand.  

With this in mind, Gu Yuan wasted no time. He swiftly collected the artifacts immobilized by the Eight Winds Treasure Rings on the ground.  

The Eight Winds Treasure Rings, a bribe from Elder Hu to keep Gu Yuan silent, were immensely powerful. Comprising eight interlocking rings, they could suppress any artifact within the Qi Refinement realm.  

Kuang Mingsheng's "Three Decays Mirror" was also a top-tier artifact capable of suppressing a cultivator's essence, energy, and spirit, mimicking the effects of the Three Heavenly Decays. Yet, even it was no match for the Eight Winds Treasure Rings.  

The rings seemed to transcend the limits of ordinary artifacts.  

Aside from the Three Decays Mirror, the "Cloud Radiance Robe" was another high-grade artifact. It could summon seven radiant veils to block a full-force strike from a seventh-layer Qi Refinement cultivator.  

With Kuang Mingsheng dead, Gu Yuan easily erased the spiritual imprints on both artifacts, claiming them as his own.  

Though he hadn't fully refined them yet and couldn't wield them as effortlessly as their previous owner, they still boosted his combat prowess significantly.  

After storing the artifacts, Gu Yuan channeled his spiritual energy and lifted the Pearl King.  

*Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!*  

The Pearl King, already highly sentient, sensed Gu Yuan's hostility and fiercely resisted his grasp.  

But no matter how intelligent it was, the Pearl King lacked offensive techniques. After a futile struggle, it could only watch as Gu Yuan pried it open and extracted the crystalline Pearl King's Orb from its tender flesh.  

The orb was translucent, exuding an intoxicating fragrance that made Gu Yuan's fingers twitch with the urge to consume it immediately.  

However, this wasn't the place for a breakthrough. Outside, the battle between the Face-Spider and Yang Yue's group could end at any moment. Whoever emerged victorious would surely come searching for the Pearl King.  

Breaking through to the sixth layer of Qi Refinement required at least half an hour of undisturbed refinement.  

Thus, Gu Yuan stored the orb in a jade vial, then activated the Void-Concealing Jade and slowly channeled his spiritual energy to slip away.  

---  

*"Die!"*  

Outside the cavern, the battle grew increasingly fierce.  

But Yang Yue and his companions were, after all, inner disciples of the Dao Academy. Fighting with their lives on the line, they gradually turned the tide, suppressing the Azure-Faced Spider and the Red-Tailed Ape.  

Gu Yuan passed by like a ghost, his gaze cold and contemplative.  

If he wished, he could take advantage of the situation and eliminate both the cultivators and the demonic beasts, reaping the spoils.  

But after some thought, he dismissed the idea.  

He was no saint, but neither was he a villain. Yang Yue and the others had no direct conflict with him. Killing them for petty gains would only lower his own standing.  

In this world of cultivation, the kindest and the cruelest often met grim ends.  

A balanced approach spared one from unnecessary trouble.  

"First, break through to the sixth layer of Qi Refinement."  

After leaving the battlefield, Gu Yuan swiftly made his way deeper into the cavern. Finding a secluded spot, he consumed the Pearl King's Orb and began his breakthrough.  

---  

Meanwhile, high above the Cloud Cliff Pearl Field, an opulent treasure ship arrived belatedly.  

Aboard were the elegant and refined scions of noble families.  

"Why must we bother with this trivial Cloud Cliff Pearl Field? A few pearls aren't worth my time—I'd rather have the Jade Void Pills from home!"  

One of the young masters complained.  

Some had to toil endlessly for the resources to cultivate, while others were born with everything they needed, advancing steadily without hardship.  

What was a precious opportunity for disciples of the Hidden Dragon Academy was barely noteworthy to these noble scions.  

"The era of great strife is upon us. Do you think you can cultivate in peace forever?"  

"If you don't hone your skills in battle now, how will you survive when disaster strikes?"  

But noble families didn't rise to prominence without reason. The wiser among them recognized the purpose behind their elders' arrangements and spoke coldly.  

Their words drew immediate agreement from others on the ship.  

True prodigals never received their families' full support. Those here were the elite among elites.  

As soon as the ship landed, streaks of light shot out as cultivators sought demonic beasts to slay.  

In a secluded corner of the ship, a silver-haired, blue-eyed youth gripped a pouch at his waist, his eyes gleaming with cold fury.  

"Little thief Gu Yuan... you will vomit up every last bit of the fortune you stole from me!"
