# Chapter 164: The Assessment  

Elder Yin walked into Li Shiming's cave dwelling with a faint smile on his face.  

Li Shiming placed a cup of spiritual tea in front of Elder Yin. Since he didn’t cultivate spirit fruits, spiritual tea was the only thing he could offer to guests.  

"Shiming, sit down," Elder Yin gestured with a wave of his hand.  

Li Shiming sat opposite Elder Yin, maintaining a respectful demeanor.  

"Last time, when you were sent to participate in the competition against Northern Shu, I wasn’t aware of it. Otherwise, I would never have allowed you to take part in such a contest. Those old fellows didn’t send their own descendants—why should you go?" Elder Yin began by explaining.  

His words warmed Li Shiming’s heart. Regardless, Elder Yin was a Golden Core elder, and the fact that he offered an explanation showed that he genuinely regarded Li Shiming as a junior under his care.  

Li Shiming sensed a shift in Elder Yin’s attitude—no longer the faint sense of exclusion he had felt during their previous meetings. His perception in this regard was extremely sharp.  

"Before you participated in the Northern Shu competition, I left the sect to find Lan’er’s master. Recently, I managed to establish contact with her, and there are some things I need to clarify with you," Elder Yin said with a serious expression.  

Li Shiming straightened his posture and fixed his gaze on Elder Yin. He understood that this must be a matter of great importance, otherwise Elder Yin wouldn’t have come in person.  

"From Lan’er’s master, I obtained more information about Northern Shu. To be honest with you, both we and the cultivators from Northern Shu are waiting. The Northern Shu Mingxin Sect has a False Infant cultivator, who is currently confronting the Senluo Sect in Northern Shu, buying time for our sect to withdraw safely."  

"If the False Infant Ancestor falls, the Mingxin Sect’s invasion of the Seven Sects will be halted. The Mingxin Sect would never wage a war they cannot win. But if the False Infant Ancestor arrives, the Seven Sects will not resist. Either the sects will disband or seek new territories elsewhere."  

Li Shiming was stunned. He hadn’t expected Elder Yin to come specifically to tell him this. Such information was likely beyond the clearance of even most Foundation Establishment cultivators in the sect, let alone him.  

"Is the False Infant Ancestor that powerful?" he asked, puzzled.  

"A False Infant is formed by forcibly breaking the Golden Core into an Infant through special techniques. They have no further growth potential, and their lifespan isn’t as long as a true Nascent Soul cultivator’s. Thus, they aren’t considered true Nascent Soul cultivators. However, their strength is only slightly weaker than a true Nascent Soul’s—far surpassing Golden Core cultivators. The gap is comparable to that between Foundation Establishment and Qi Refinement," Elder Yin explained.  

Li Shiming finally understood the sheer power of a False Infant. No wonder the Golden Core elders of the Seven Sects were ready to abandon resistance.  

"Don’t think we don’t want to resist—it’s just meaningless. The might of a False Infant cultivator isn’t something the Seven Sects can withstand. Right now, both the Seven Sects and the Mingxin Sect are waiting for the final outcome."  

"The sect has also devised plans for promising disciples. Some will be sent in advance to another territory across the land, where there’s a decent spiritual vein. They can hold out there for some time." At this point, Elder Yin looked directly at Li Shiming.  

"Uncle Yin, I don’t want to go," Li Shiming shook his head. He had little sense of belonging to the sect, and the sect’s support for his cultivation had been dwindling.  

Without the sect’s protection, the Tianhai Sect would be largely irrelevant to him for a long time.  

This was especially true now that he had his own primary cultivation method and a substantial reserve of spirit stones, ensuring he could live comfortably at least until the Foundation Establishment stage.  

Of course, he still needed the sect. When he aimed for the Golden Core stage, he would struggle to obtain third-grade materials without the sect’s help.  

But if the Tianhai Sect lost its territory, it would no longer be able to sustain the resources needed to nurture Golden Core cultivators.  

Moreover, relocating to another territory wasn’t necessarily safe. Once the Mingxin Sect fully controlled this region, they would never tolerate the presence of other forces.  

"If you hadn’t demonstrated your strength in the previous competition, I would have already included you in the early evacuation plan. But now, I’m giving you another choice," Elder Yin said with a helpless smile.  

He knew that Li Shiming had developed a rift with certain factions within the sect. The internal power struggles had diminished Li Shiming’s sense of belonging to the sect.  

Li Shiming’s choice didn’t surprise him. Even as a Golden Core elder, he was powerless to intervene in the sect’s internal conflicts.  

But none of that mattered anymore. If they were forced to evacuate, these factions would collapse instantly, becoming insignificant.  

"Please speak, Uncle Yin," Li Shiming said, knowing that Elder Yin was about to reveal the main purpose of this meeting.  

"Lan’er’s master is a Golden Core formation master from the Northern Shu Qianhuan Sect. She came here for a treasure in the North Sea. Due to the Mingxin Sect’s invasion, she doesn’t want to get involved in their conflict. Her intention is to take Lan’er to Northern Shu to join the Qianhuan Sect..." Elder Yin paused when he saw Li Shiming’s expression change.  

Li Shiming felt conflicted. If Yin Shilan had a brighter future ahead, it should have been a cause for celebration.  

But if she went to Northern Shu, he might never see her again—something he couldn’t accept.  

"With your three-spiritual-root aptitude, even with your intermediate formation mastery, you wouldn’t meet the Qianhuan Sect’s admission criteria. However, your comprehension of sword intent gives you an opportunity. If Lan’er’s master agrees, you can become an ordinary disciple of the Qianhuan Sect," Elder Yin continued.  

Li Shiming hadn’t expected such an opportunity. But he still had concerns. Northern Shu was embroiled in war, with even Nascent Soul cultivators involved. The intensity of the conflict was beyond his imagination.  

"Uncle Yin, what kind of sect is the Qianhuan Sect?" Li Shiming pressed.  

Elder Yin smiled, pleased that Li Shiming didn’t blindly accept the offer. To go far in the path of cultivation, one needed to consider carefully before making the right choice.  

"The Qianhuan Sect is a major sect with a Nascent Soul Ancestor, ranking among the top in Northern Shu. As for the chaos in Northern Shu, I’ve learned that it’s confined to the Hundred Thousand Mountains region. The Senluo Sect wouldn’t dare extend the frontlines beyond that area," Elder Yin replied patiently.  

"Thank you, Uncle Yin," Li Shiming said, having made his decision. Joining the Qianhuan Sect was an acceptable option.  

This way, he wouldn’t have to part with Yin Shilan and could enjoy the benefits of a major sect.  

"Don’t thank me yet. I’ll take you to meet Lan’er’s master immediately. She’ll decide whether you qualify for admission," Elder Yin said, waving his hand.  

Elder Yin stood and led Li Shiming out of Eagle Beak Island, heading toward the Nine Peaks.  

Under Elder Yin’s guidance, Li Shiming landed outside a cave dwelling at the summit of the Nine Peaks.  

Elder Yin sent a beam of light into the cave’s formation. After a brief wait, the formation opened.  

"Come in, Fellow Daoist Yin," a pleasant female voice sounded in Li Shiming’s ears.  

Elder Yin nodded at Li Shiming, signaling him to follow, and then entered the cave.  

As Li Shiming stepped inside, his first impression was the overwhelming density of spiritual energy. The concentration was so high that he could almost feel the energy seeping into his pores with every breath.  

The spiritual energy here was so rich that he couldn’t even describe it. Perhaps one wouldn’t even need to cultivate—just sleeping here daily would allow a Qi Refinement cultivator to advance from the early stage to the peak effortlessly.  

In the cave’s main hall, an elegant woman who appeared to be in her thirties greeted Elder Yin with a smile.  

"Fellow Daoist Luo, I’ve brought Li Shiming. Please take a look," Elder Yin said, his tone unusually deferential. Though both were Golden Core cultivators, Luo’s status as a formation master from the Qianhuan Sect commanded respect.  

Moreover, his daughter would be under Luo’s care in the future. As a father, lowering his stance was nothing shameful.  

"Shiming, come and greet her," he turned and reminded Li Shiming.  

"Li Shiming pays his respects to Senior Luo," Li Shiming bowed.  

Luo the Formation Master turned her gaze to Li Shiming. As he straightened from his bow, their eyes met, and Luo activated her Formation Starlight Sea.  

Li Shiming felt the vast expanse of Luo’s Formation Starlight Sea—a continuous landscape resembling an ink painting.  

Her Formation Starlight Sea was alive. Trees on the mountains swayed in the wind, and fish swam in the rivers, creating a vivid, natural world.  

"This is a master’s Formation Starlight Sea!" Li Shiming marveled inwardly.  

Every mountain and river in the Formation Starlight Sea was composed of countless starlights, representing Luo’s immense knowledge of formations.  

What was even more astonishing was how these starlights seamlessly merged into lifelike landscapes, conforming to the natural laws of heaven and earth.  

Luo had activated her Formation Starlight Sea to observe Li Shiming’s.  

Her willingness to assess him wasn’t solely due to Elder Yin’s request but also because of Yin Shilan’s earnest pleas.  

Even as a formation master of the Qianhuan Sect, the number of admission slots she could grant was limited.  

Major sects had stood firm in the cultivation world for countless years precisely because of their strict management systems.  

While Elder Yin might have been impressed by Li Shiming’s comprehension of sword intent at the Qi Refinement stage, Luo, as a formation master, couldn’t care less about sword intent. What she valued was his mastery of formations.  

Yin Shilan had spoken highly of Li Shiming in front of her, sparking her curiosity.  

Yin Shilan’s talent was extraordinary—a heavenly spiritual root and rare aptitude for formations. Even though she was from the Tianhai Sect, Luo had taken her as a disciple.  

Taking advantage of the Mingxin Sect’s invasion, Luo planned to bring Yin Shilan back to the Qianhuan Sect and formally accept her as a personal disciple.  

Luo’s Formation Starlight Sea triggered Li Shiming’s, allowing her to observe it. She found his Formation Starlight Sea peculiar—she couldn’t identify what it represented.  

But she could sense its immense potential, surpassing even her own landscape Formation Starlight Sea in some aspects.  

This was the limitation of differing worldviews. Even as a Golden Core cultivator, Luo’s understanding of the world was shaped by what she had seen.  

In her perception, a Formation Starlight Sea forming a landscape was the pinnacle of her comprehension.  

But Li Shiming was different. His knowledge of the universe from his past life had shaped his understanding of the world’s operation, so his Formation Starlight Sea naturally evolved in that direction.  

"You’ve become an advanced formation master!" Luo exclaimed in surprise.  

This wasn’t a question but a statement. Despite its unusual form, Li Shiming’s Formation Starlight Sea had reached the level of an advanced formation master.  

Luo reassessed Li Shiming, her eyes revealing a hint of regret.  

His innate talent was simply too poor. A three-spiritual-root aptitude was mediocre, and the chances of him reaching the Golden Core stage were slim.  

Even with his exceptional formation talent, he would only have two hundred years of lifespan after reaching Foundation Establishment.  

"Li Shiming, your formation talent is commendable. Here is the Qianhuan Sect’s admission token. With this, you can join as a formal disciple," Luo said, handing him a jade token with a unique mark.  

Elder Yin, standing nearby, looked pleased. Li Shiming’s admission to the Qianhuan Sect was a satisfactory outcome.  

Otherwise, Yin Shilan would never have agreed to leave. If she stayed behind now, her safety would be a concern.  

"Take the token and leave now," Luo waved her hand dismissively.  

"Thank you, Senior Luo," Li Shiming bowed and exited the cave.  

"Fellow Daoist Luo, when do you plan to return to the sect?" Elder Yin signaled for Li Shiming to wait outside and asked Luo.  

"In a few days. Lan’er is too stubborn," Luo said, her tone a mix of exasperation and fondness.  

If not for Yin Shilan’s stubborn insistence on waiting for Li Shiming, she would have left long ago.  

"How will Li Shiming get to Northern Shu?" Elder Yin asked, noticing Luo hadn’t mentioned him.  

"If he can’t even manage that, what right does he have to join the Qianhuan Sect?" Luo had no intention of taking Li Shiming with them.  

She wouldn’t allow Li Shiming to leave with Yin Shilan. She planned to take Yin Shilan as her personal disciple, and for a long time, Yin Shilan’s primary focus would be learning.  

Though she had agreed to Li Shiming joining the Qianhuan Sect, the later he arrived, the more time Yin Shilan would have to study undisturbed.  

Elder Yin said nothing more. He understood Luo’s stance. There were ways for Li Shiming to reach Northern Shu, though it would be troublesome.  

But now that the hardest part—securing admission—was done, the rest was manageable.
