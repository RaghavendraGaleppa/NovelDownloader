## Chapter 57: A Lone Rider Charges Jinji Ridge

Qin Ming sensed something and glanced at the mountain range from which the Purple Lightning Beast had emerged, but he didn't want to investigate further; getting to his destination was paramount right now.

Deep within the mountains, a man in his late thirties, clad in fluttering green robes, stood on a cliff overlooking the landscape. On the majestic peak opposite, white mist billowed, and hazy, ethereal clouds enveloped most of the mountain. Within the mist, a higher being appeared.

"New City Lord of Crimson Glow City, why are you here instead of taking your post?"

"Passing through, I specifically came to see the Mountain Master."

***

After galloping for over ten *li*, the Purple Lightning Beast grew restless again. Its fur shimmered with purple mist, and its wild dash became incredibly bumpy, losing its steady pace. Sometimes, it would suddenly slow down. Anyone else would have lost their balance long ago, perhaps even falling off.

Qin Ming saw it acting up again and pressed the phoenix-patterned long saber against its neck. Instantly, a tuft of faintly glowing purple mane broke off, and blood began to flow from a cut on its neck.

"If you won't give me a ride, I'll give *you* a ride!" Qin Ming hadn't intended to completely subdue it. At the same time, he felt no guilt. The Purple Lightning Beast had kicked him first; an ordinary person would have had their head crushed.

"Straighten up, or you're heading straight to the grave!" Qin Ming pressed the saber again. This time, the Purple Lightning Beast was truly startled, the blood on its neck soaking its mane. It immediately fell silent, becoming quite obedient. From then on, the journey was smooth, with only over ten *li* remaining to Jinji Ridge.

Qin Ming was slightly lost in thought. Even without using his Heavenly Light energy, he could sit very steadily on the back of this exotic beast, riding it with ease. Prior to this, he had never ridden a horse or similar creature in the Black-White Mountain region. What's more, he was riding bareback now, without a bridle or reins on the Purple Lightning Beast. Vaguely, some images appeared in his mind: outside a massive city, he had once galloped wildly on a beast, one that looked even more impressive than this Purple Lightning Beast.

He shook his head, pushing those thoughts away. But as if by habit, he used his long saber like a riding crop, gently tapping the Purple Lightning Beast's flank with its blunt edge. The exotic beast instantly jumped in fright, thinking it was about to be cut again. It moved as if riding the wind, accelerating like an arrow loosed from a bowstring, shimmering with purple light and mist, tearing through the heavy darkness of the night.

Qin Ming rode the fierce beast, galloping through the long night, nearing Jinji Ridge!

Ahead, the area was brightly lit. Even in the dead of night, Jinji Ridge was not dim because its fire spring was close to a second-tier rating, almost comparable to the one in Silver Vine Town. The road was wide, leading directly up the ridge, flanked by dense forests. There were no exotic beasts lurking about, as they knew the bandits here were formidable.

However, Jinji Ridge was much quieter now than before. They had suffered heavy casualties when they went to the Great Rift Valley to compete for the mysterious resources, and many exotic beasts in Black-White Mountain had gorged themselves that day. There were still about thirty people on the mountain now. Those who had been allowed to stay and guard the stronghold that day all had certain connections, and these individuals were even more malicious. As Old Man Liu would say, you could swing a blade at any of the remaining bandits without worrying about accidentally killing a good person; they deserved to die several times over.

Qin Ming sheathed his long saber, took the sturdy bow from his back, and riding the Purple Lightning Beast, charged into the brightly lit area of Jinji Ridge where the fire spring flowed.

The first to discover him were not the bandits, but a Golden Rooster specially used for vigilance. This twice-mutated creature was indeed very responsible. Hiding in the forest, upon seeing someone trespassing, it immediately let out a loud cry: "Cock-a-doodle-doo!"

Qin Ming's first iron arrow shot towards it. With a *thud*, the Golden Rooster's head was pierced by the high-speed arrow, and its cry ceased abruptly.

"What happened?" Some in the stronghold were already heavily drunk.

Some old bandits woke with a start, shouting, "Enemy attack!" These men sprang to their feet, seeing on the road outside the stronghold a lone rider on a beast, enveloped in a hazy purple glow, like a heavenly light tearing through the night, charging towards the mountain gate.

In the past, their watchtowers and stronghold walls would certainly have had a contingent of archers. But now, Jinji Ridge was in a semi-crippled state, and the remaining individuals rarely did any work. In such a cold season, with snowflakes still falling from the sky, most of them were huddled indoors, eating, drinking, and gambling.

Qin Ming charged forth with his beast. The sturdy stronghold gate, before the Purple Lightning Beast's heavy and powerful hooves, was *smashed* with a loud bang. The lone rider and beast directly stormed into the Jinji Ridge stronghold.

"Everyone get up, enemy attack!" Jinji Ridge fell into chaos. Even the drunkards knew what was happening. The stronghold was brightly lit. The nearly second-tier fire spring flowed with fiery haze, making it a valuable place, far superior to the villages outside the mountain.

At this moment, Qin Ming was clad in gleaming armor, his entire face obscured by the helmet's visor, with only his eyes, mouth, and nose exposed. In the eyes of these bandits, the lone rider and beast were too fast, shimmering with purple light, terrifying and astonishing, possessing unparalleled destructive power.

Qin Ming drew his bow and fired arrows in rapid succession. One iron arrow after another, illuminated by the fiery haze, flew like streaks of cold lightning. *Thud, thud, thud...* In just one encounter, he successively shot down five people. Some bandits hadn't even reacted before an arrow pierced their glabella, while two others were killed by the same iron arrow piercing their chests.

"Quick, loose arrows and counterattack!" Someone sobered up, quickly organized men, and at the same time whistled, issuing commands to the tamed Golden Roosters to charge the enemy.

Qin Ming had deeply studied the Wu family's secret manual, which stated he was exceptional in both spear and archery, and it was no joke. The bow and arrows in his hand seemed to have a soul, and his eyes were incredibly sharp. The person giving orders hadn't even finished speaking before Qin Ming shot his head off with a special heavy arrow. Under the illumination of the fire spring's light, this scene was starkly clear. Blood and shattered bone splattered onto other mountain bandits, creating a powerful deterrent. A few individuals' bodies almost froze in place.

However, they were ultimately bandits who had seen blood, and their ferocity was strong. In an instant, they began shouting and counterattacking, some drawing bows and firing arrows. At this moment, five Golden Roosters also charged over, spreading their wings, extending their massive beaks, and extending their sharp claws, rushing towards the lone rider and beast.

The Purple Lightning Beast, having been forced up the mountain, was already incredibly aggrieved and full of pent-up anger. Now attacked by the lesser Golden Roosters, it became instantly enraged. It let out a roar. Although it had a horse-like head, its body was like that of a tiger or leopard, incredibly fierce. It immediately reared up on its hind legs, raising its massive hooves and smashing them down. With two *thuds*, two Golden Roosters died one after another: one had its head crushed by the Purple Lightning Beast, another had its body pierced. Then, it vigorously swung its head, its mouth full of sharp teeth, biting a Golden Rooster's neck and swiftly "decapitating" it.

Throughout this process, whether it reared up or leaped forward, Qin Ming remained stuck to its back as if on flat ground, always incredibly stable. He continuously drew his bow and fired arrows, single-handedly suppressing the bandits' volleys. Two great bandits had appeared silently, but they did not act immediately. They knew that anyone daring to charge in alone was no simple individual; their posture indicated considerable power.

In fact, they still underestimated Qin Ming, as they judged the enemy's level by the force of his arrows. However, the sturdy bow itself had limited strength, and was far from reaching Qin Ming's true upper limit. The next moment, they realized their judgment was wrong, because one of the great bandits personally drew his bow and fired an arrow at Qin Ming. Qin Ming, however, lightly deflected that powerful arrow with an iron arrow, sending it flying amidst a shower of sparks. This level of eyesight and judgment made the two great bandits' hearts sink. At the same time, Qin Ming also drew his bow and fired arrows towards their location.

*Thud!*

The two great bandits dodged, but a young man beside them was shot through the head by an arrow, falling backward onto the ground, unable to even let out a scream. One great bandit let out a low growl. This was clearly someone close to him, and it caused his killing intent to surge.

Qin Ming continued to shoot and kill! In just this short moment, Jinji Ridge had lost more than a dozen men. Originally, there were only about thirty people left, and now nearly half had been eliminated.

Qin Ming directly rode the Purple Lightning Beast, charging towards the nearby wooden houses. He put away his bow and arrows, gripping the sharp great spear. As the lone rider and beast charged, many bandits felt a chill run down their spines, as if a thousand troops were attacking. The mount was too ferocious, instantly trampling several twice-mutated Golden Roosters to death. And the person clad in cold armor on the exotic beast's back was like a god of slaughter, taking a life with every arrow. Many couldn't help but tremble when meeting his gaze.

The single rider, a solitary shadow, drew near. Qin Ming thrust his spear, vigorously shaking it, directly impaling a wooden house and causing it to instantly explode into fragments. The two people inside the wooden house panicked, raising their blades to strike. However, they had only undergone one rebirth, and facing such a lone rider and beast was simply suicidal. Two splashes of blood bloomed. Qin Ming struck out with his spear like lightning, piercing them one after another, then charged again towards the two great bandits of Jinji Ridge.

The Purple Lightning Beast was fierce. It reared up on its hind legs, its heavy hooves stomping forward, causing a wooden house to instantly disintegrate and shatter into pieces. Qin Ming sensed something. The sound of wind came from behind him. He whirled around, raising his spear and thrusting.

It was an old bandit, one Qin Ming had seen in the Great Rift Valley. Naturally, anyone who could return alive from there would be a third rebirth realm cultivator. At this moment, he was surprisingly riding a Golden Rooster much larger than its kin, his mount clearly having mutated three times. It half-flew down from a higher elevation, launching a surprise attack.

"Jinji Ridge has some tricks up its sleeve; they can cultivate these mutated creatures on a large scale," Qin Ming thought, unafraid. His long spear produced dozens of illusory shadows. In mid-air, the old man swung his blade repeatedly, his arms numb from the vibrations. He was horrified to discover how vast the gap was between him and his opponent. His sneak attack had failed, and he would very likely die here. At his level, his instincts were quite sharp; he had a premonition.

In fact, death came even faster than he anticipated. When the great spear in Qin Ming's hand trembled, it not only blocked the old man's long blade but also created a dozen bloodied holes on the three-times mutated Golden Rooster, causing it to die instantly.

"Ah..." The old man cried out, swinging his blade, trying to escape from mid-air. However, his opponent below was far superior in strength. Amidst the dense spear shadows, he couldn't distinguish which were real and which were illusory. With a *thud*, he was pierced through the chest by a spear. Qin Ming impaled and killed him, then, like discarding a scarecrow, he flung the old man's corpse from his long spear more than ten meters away, sending it crashing into a wooden house. The people inside recoiled in horror. This was a master second only to the two great bandits in their stronghold, yet he was killed so effortlessly by the opponent.

At Qin Ming's signal, the Purple Lightning Beast slowed its pace, but its cries were heavy. Ignoring the other bandits, it directly pressed towards the two great bandits. Both great bandits had grave expressions. One drew a broadsword, the other held a long pike, and both advanced. Just then, from the shadows to one side, another old man silently appeared, suddenly attacking Qin Ming from behind, intending to coordinate with the two great bandits.

Qin Ming gripped his long spear with one hand, pointing its tip unmoving at the two great bandits in front. With his left hand, he swiftly drew the phoenix-patterned long saber from his back. Like a dazzling flash of lightning, it slashed past, sending the sharp sword in the old man's hand flying over twenty meters away. This strike from Qin Ming carried immense power, not even being momentarily hindered. After sending the long sword flying, the blade sliced through the night at an even faster speed, *slicing* through the old man's shoulder diagonally, leaving him dead with eyes wide open in disbelief. Another third rebirth realm cultivator had fallen!
