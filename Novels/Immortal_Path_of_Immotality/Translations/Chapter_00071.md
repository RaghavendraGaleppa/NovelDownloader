# Chapter 71: The Immortal Book Bestows Its Power  

Unbeknownst to Lin Shan, every word of his conversation with Princess Guo had been overheard by several people hiding behind the house.  

"Did any of you give yourselves away?" Princess Guo asked coldly.  

"Not a chance. My Cloud Veil Barrier completely masks our presence. Unless that kid is at the Foundation Establishment stage, there's no way he could detect us," one of them declared confidently, clearly proud of his magical artifact.  

A man in brocade robes, noticing Princess Guo's displeasure, asked, "What's wrong, sister? Did that boy do something suspicious?"  

Princess Guo gritted her teeth in frustration. "That brat is too cautious! No matter how much I tried to persuade him, he refused to leave Yichuan to explore with us."  

The middle-aged man in brocade sighed. "Even someone like Qi Zhong, a disciple of the prestigious Qianyun Pavilion, was utterly captivated by your beauty, sister. How could this boy be so unresponsive?"  

The other two couldn’t help but ask, "What do we do now? If he doesn’t take the bait, how can we deal with him outside Yichuan’s market?"  

Princess Guo shook her head and sighed. "We’ll have to wait. He’s probably trying to reach the peak of the mid Qi Refining stage. Even though he got storage pouches from Immortal Huang, the Green-robed Ghost, and his accomplice, breaking through the mid-stage bottleneck in a short time is impossible."  

The other two grew anxious. "If he sells that premium mid-grade magical artifact, he could get five hundred spirit stones—enough to buy a mid-stage Breakthrough Pill!"  

The brocade-robed man’s expression turned cold. "Exactly. If that mid-grade artifact ends up in my sister’s hands, she could sell it for spirit stones, buy the Breakthrough Pill, and immediately advance to the late Qi Refining stage."  

"A late-stage Qi Refiner under twenty, with a rare ice spiritual root—even if her talent doesn’t meet the standards of a major immortal sect, she’d still have a chance with ordinary sects. Once that happens, won’t our status rise as well?"  

"That boy can’t be allowed to escape. Even if he never leaves Yichuan, we’ll intercept him on his way back to Bianliang!"  

A cold glint flashed in Princess Guo’s eyes. "I’ll keep a close watch on him these next few days!"  

---  

Back at the inn, though Lin Shan had reached a truce with Princess Guo, he wasn’t naive enough to fully trust her. Strengthening his own power was the true path forward. Since she had bought the straw effigy for him, he might as well accept her goodwill for now.  

In his room, he took out the newly acquired straw effigy—what the enhancement panel had called the "Seven Nails and Seven Arrows Book" divine ability—and immediately absorbed its 12 points of ancient essence. The number in the top-right corner of the enhancement panel changed from "3" to "15."  

After a closer inspection, he confirmed it was just a simple straw effigy with no other special features.  

The only peculiar thing was that no matter how much straw he pulled from it, the effigy would regrow and restore itself. In other words, it was indestructible.  

Lin Shan tried everything—pressing it to his forehead to probe with his divine sense (useless), channeling spiritual energy into it (no response), even dripping blood on it (still no clue).  

"What exactly is hidden inside this effigy? Where’s the divine ability?"  

Frustrated, he resorted to more extreme methods—burning it, soaking it in water, smoking it, grinding it with his cold iron sword—but nothing could reveal its secrets.  

"No wonder that old woman was willing to sell it. She must have tried everything and only dared to ask for ten spirit stones because she knew it was strange."  

After an entire day of fruitless experimentation, Lin Shan was at his wit’s end.  

That night, he suddenly recalled the enhancement panel’s instructions:  

"Prepare a straw effigy, a bow and arrows, and two lamps. Place an item, blood, or hair containing the target’s essence before the effigy, then perform the curse by shooting arrows into it to grievously wound the target from afar."  

Why not give it a try?  

With nothing to lose, Lin Shan improvised. He didn’t bother replicating the elaborate ritual from legends—lighting a lamp above his head and another beneath his feet—who knew how that even worked?  

Instead, he simply placed two oil lamps on either side of the effigy and set a random item from the Green-robed Elder’s storage pouch in front of it. The old man was already dead, making him the perfect test subject.  

For the bow and arrows, Lin Shan fashioned a crude bow from beast sinew and whittled a few wooden arrows.  

He drew the bow, nocked an arrow, and aimed at the effigy.  

The ritual was simple, but the next moment, something in the void seemed to activate. A flash of white light erupted before the effigy.  

Suddenly, Lin Shan felt his consciousness yanked into an illusion. A wizened wandering spirit drifted through a mountain wilderness, seemingly waiting for underworld ghost envoys to guide it. Its face was unmistakably that of the Green-robed Elder’s ghost.  

Lin Shan was stunned.  

The Green-robed Elder had only been dead for three or four days. Normally, spirits could linger in the mortal realm for up to seven days. But this guy was just idling around—had the ghost envoys gone on strike? Did the underworld have slackers too?  

In that instant, Lin Shan’s consciousness in the illusion saw the Green-robed Elder’s ghost being locked onto by some unseen force. Simultaneously, his physical body sensed an indescribable presence connecting with him.  

The arrow was already nocked—there was no turning back.  

Lin Shan felt as though he was offering the Green-robed Elder’s ghost as a sacrifice to that immense presence. Once the bowstring was released, there was no stopping it.  

*Thwack!*  

The arrow struck the effigy. In the illusion, the Green-robed Elder’s ghost let out a silent scream as black smoke erupted from his form, engulfing him completely.  

Moments later, the illusion faded, leaving only the serene mountain scenery. The ghost was gone, as if it had never existed.  

Lin Shan’s consciousness returned to his body. Dazed, he stared at the effigy before him, now radiating an ethereal light that stretched into an ancient, unfathomable void.  

Following the effigy’s connection, his gaze traveled along an endless corridor through the darkness, where a scroll of purple parchment lay at the eternal terminus.  

"The Seven Nails and Seven Arrows Book!"  

The name surfaced in Lin Shan’s mind unbidden. The purple scroll exuded an immortal aura, wreathed in swirling ribbons of light. Untouched for countless ages, it now bridged the void through the effigy, locking onto Lin Shan’s vision.  

A torrent of purple energy surged from the scroll, racing along the void’s path and bursting from the effigy into Lin Shan’s mind.  

"Ah!"  

A flood of ancient, profound knowledge erupted in his consciousness, churning like a stormy sea before coalescing into a mysterious purple seed embedded deep within his soul.  

When Lin Shan cautiously examined this seed rooted in his soul, the enhancement panel appeared.

"A divine ability seed!"  

Upon touching the seed in his soul, Lin Shan instantly understood its function. It represented complete mastery of a divine ability, allowing flawless execution without any casting delay. Such mastery condensed into a seed within the soul.  

"Did the legendary immortal artifact—the true Seven Nails and Seven Arrows Book—bestow this seed upon me through the void?"  

A realization struck Lin Shan. *Is this the Witch Dao Sect’s legacy art? This truly is a heaven-defying opportunity!*  

Returning to reality, Lin Shan found the room dark once more. The bow lay on the floor, the effigy remained on the table, and the two lamps flickered eerily.  

Outside the window, the night was pitch-black, with no moon in sight.
