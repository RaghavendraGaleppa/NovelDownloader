# Chapter 19: What Exactly Is Up With This Taoist?

The evil cultivator departed with regret and confusion.

Though he had realized his mistake in that moment—that villains shouldn't talk too much—it was already too late. The Taoist had already bared his torso and drawn his sword.

The sword energy was extraordinarily powerful, forcing everyone to give way.

Xiao Ji was holding back in his attacks, considering there were bystanders nearby.

After several exchanges, the group fought their way into the spacious courtyard, finally able to unleash their full potential.

Although Xiao Ji had recently dealt with a fifth-level Qi Refining evil physician, this situation was different. That one had relied entirely on magical artifacts for cultivation and had extremely poor aptitude—finding his weakness and destroying the infant spirit had been enough to easily subdue him.

But this opponent before him had genuinely cultivated his skills step by step, with ruthless techniques aimed at vital points with every strike.

Most importantly, this guy loved shouting during attacks and was fond of dirty tricks.

"Gouge your eyes!"

The evil cultivator detached his left arm and wielded it as a magical artifact with his right hand. The five fingers at the tip of the artifact constantly shifted forms—sometimes a fist, sometimes claws, sometimes two fingers poised to pluck out eyes.

[He says he'll gouge your eyes, but he's actually aiming for your groin.]

If not for his ability to anticipate the opponent's moves, this scoundrel would have been truly difficult to handle.

Xiao Ji thrust his Thunderbolt Sword downward, blocking the evil cultivator's advance and forcing him to hastily adjust his shameless maneuver.

After several failed attempts, the evil cultivator began doubting himself, his combat effectiveness dropping significantly.

Because he simply couldn't land a hit.

"Constable Song, are you all here to watch a show? Not planning to help at all?" Xiao Ji reminded the constables to do their jobs.

"Oh, right! Brothers, let's go! Show him what we practiced!" Song Yuanbao twirled his official saber and leaped forward to slash at the evil cultivator.

Their earlier distraction wasn't due to wanting to watch a fight between tigers from a safe distance—it was just that the Taoist from Yuanshen Temple seemed to be handling things effortlessly, appearing not to need help.

With the constables joining in, the battle became one-sided.

"I can't win this," the evil cultivator felt immense pressure. Even his most vicious moves were ineffective. He muttered to himself, "And there's that guy in their ranks who keeps shouting from a distance—he's way too loud."

Xiao Ji also frowned and glanced at the particularly noisy constable.

This was a first-level Qi Refining martial artist who stood at a distance with his saber, never shutting up. Not only was the evil cultivator annoyed, even Xiao Ji found it unbearable—he wanted to tear the man's mouth shut.

"His body turned slightly left... his eyes are looking at the boss... careful, the black smoke from his artifact is thickening... his chest is rising and falling, probably breathing..."

What an incessantly chatty constable.

Quite the character.

The evil cultivator felt a sense of crisis: "I must escape. What a pity—my cultivation plan in Willow Town is ruined. Just three more years and I could have broken through to the ninth level of Qi Refinement..."

"First, I'll pretend to attack the Taoist, then suddenly turn and strike at the constable. They'll think my target is the constable, but in reality, I'll take that noisy one hostage. Then I'll throw him at them and escape over the right wall while they're distracted."

"That's the plan."

The evil cultivator's mind raced.

Just as he was about to execute this meticulous plan, he noticed the bare-chested Taoist was already standing below the right wall, blocking his escape route in advance.

"What... how did he get there?" The evil cultivator was stunned briefly. "No matter. I'll adjust—first attack the constable, then when the Taoist moves to strike my right, I'll suddenly leap forward."

"Then grab that noisy constable, escape over the left wall, and throw him back to distract pursuers. A brief moment is all I need to get away."

"After all, I'm at the fifth level of Qi Refinement—no one can catch me. That's the plan."

Just as he prepared to execute this new plan, he saw the Taoist had already positioned himself at the base of the left wall, grinning maliciously with his sword in hand.

"What... what's going on?" Cold sweat poured down the evil cultivator's forehead. His body felt chilled—today's events were too bizarre. "No matter, I'm not completely cornered yet. Look at these people—they just circle and shout, not daring to engage. I can still..."

"Ah, that constable is too loud! It's messing with my focus..."

Regaining his composure, the evil cultivator continued plotting his escape during the standoff. He decided to leap onto the roof behind him and make his getaway.

But just as he prepared to execute this new plan, he saw the Taoist had already jumped onto the rear roof, once again cutting off his escape.

The Taoist stood on the rooftop, his well-proportioned muscles seeming to glow, making it hard to look directly at him.

"What... what is happening?" The evil cultivator began doubting his own sanity, wondering if he was trapped in an illusion.

Within moments, he confirmed this was all happening in reality.

Which meant the problem was the Taoist.

"I'll fight you to the death!" The evil cultivator lost all reason and charged at Xiao Ji.

A panicked evil cultivator, facing a Taoist of equal strength plus several trained constables, stood no chance.

Xiao Ji leaped down from the roof. With sweeping and thrusting strikes of his Thunderbolt Sword, he forced the evil cultivator to the ground in just a few exchanges.

Song Yuanbao feinted with his saber and landed a left punch on the evil cultivator's shoulder. Though not powerful enough to cause serious injury, it created an opening.

Seizing the moment, Xiao Ji's sword pierced the evil cultivator's dantian, causing a massive release of spiritual energy.

With an upward flick of the blade, the energy surged into the man's brain, making him collapse like a limp noodle.

"He's down! His body's twitching, fists clenched..." The chatty constable continued narrating the scene from a safe distance.

"Can you shut up? I just want some peace." In his final moments, the evil cultivator seemed oddly calm, his request simple.

His dying gaze fixed on Xiao Ji, as if wanting to ask something—but the opportunity never came.

Song Yuanbao ordered the Tu family's property sealed and had Tu Mantun taken to the magistrate's office.

Xiao Ji approached the talkative constable. "What's your name?"

"You can call me Asui, Taoist," the constable replied.

Having witnessed Xiao Ji's prowess, the constables now regarded him with respect.

"Uh... fitting," Xiao Ji didn't know how else to respond.

After arranging follow-up matters, Song Yuanbao approached Xiao Ji. "Taoist Xiao, we owe you our thanks. On behalf of Willow Town's magistrate office, I'll personally deliver the bounty to Yuanshen Temple in a few days."

Regarding the bounty, Xiao Ji had questions. "Constable Song, what's the current process for cooperating with the magistrate's office?"

"The office posts wanted lists periodically at the bulletin board. If you're interested, you can check there," Song Yuanbao explained.

"I've been to the bulletin board, but the rewards are all in silver. Are there any cases that pay in spirit stones?" Xiao Ji needed spirit stones for travel funds.

"If it's spirit stones you want, our Willow Town office can't provide that," Song Yuanbao fiddled with his saber before remembering something. "But recently, Giant Dragon City issued new regulations about cooperation between the court and wandering cultivators. If bounty hunters want spirit stones, local offices can apply to the county's Demon-Suppression Division."

"I believe it's three thousand taels of silver for one low-grade Yellow Rank spirit stone—not a great deal. Silver is much more practical."

After some discussion, reinforcements arrived to seal and investigate the Tu residence.

Having dealt with those coveting Yuanshen Temple, Xiao Ji felt it was just a minor matter, nothing particularly exciting.

Bidding farewell to Song Yuanbao, he returned to Yuanshen Temple.

The entire way back, he pondered how to acquire spirit stones.

As a proper cultivator, earning spirit stones was a long-term endeavor. Currently, cooperating with the authorities seemed the only way to obtain his first batch.

With initial capital, he could then hunt for bargains and trade.

So absorbed was he in these thoughts that he forgot his robes had been torn apart. In the dead of winter, he walked back to Yuanshen Temple bare-chested, sword in hand.

The young women along the way certainly got an eyeful.
