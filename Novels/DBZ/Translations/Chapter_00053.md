# Chapter 53: Gongyang Yan Shows Favor

The palace was divided into two levels.

The first level, the main hall, already had spacious seats arranged in rows. At the very front was a raised platform, where the auction items would be displayed to all bidders later. The second level of the palace contained individual rooms, each with a balcony overlooking the auction platform. This was the VIP section, reserved for individuals of status and influence. For example, the Qiao Immortal Cultivation Family, similar in standing to the Bai Family; or the Iron Sword Sect, a small cultivation sect within Yunzhou. Naturally, there was also a private room specifically for Wei Gan and his two companions. The view from here was expansive, allowing them to easily observe every move of the cultivators below.

Two *kèchén* (thirty minutes) passed, and the previously spacious auction hall was now packed. Once everyone was confirmed to be present, with a soft *click*, the palace doors closed. Then, with a *hum*, a gentle pillar of light descended from above, enveloping the entire auction platform. This was a protective measure, to prevent anyone from rashly rushing up to seize auction items or harm the auctioneers. A figure in a purple dress slowly descended from the sky, like a celestial maiden from the heavenly palace.

"Welcome, fellow Daoists, to this auction," she announced. "This humble one is Ziluó. With the gracious approval of our host, I shall be presiding over this auction."

Fairy Ziluó's voice was like a clear spring, easily eliciting a faint sense of goodwill from most people in the hall. However, at any time, there are always those who spoil the mood. Immediately, a burly man below shouted loudly, "Fairy Ziluó, everyone's time is precious. Let's start the auction quickly! Old Luo here is getting impatient!"

Fairy Ziluó smiled charmingly and said, "Naturally, this humble one will not waste fellow Daoists' time. However, before the auction begins, there are a few matters that need to be explained in advance. During the auction, threatening via spiritual messages, malicious bidding, and private collusion are strictly prohibited. Should anyone disrupt the normal auction order, they will receive a warning. A repeat offense will result in expulsion from the auction venue." As she spoke, Fairy Ziluó's voice changed from its previous alluring tone, becoming cold and stern. After issuing the warning, she smiled brightly again, as if the person who had just spoken wasn't her.

"Now, please present the first item of this auction: the Yuan-Enhancing Pill."

"As is widely known, the Yuan-Enhancing Pill is a medicinal pill for cultivators in the Mid-Stage Qi Condensation realm to advance their spiritual power. However, this batch of Yuan-Enhancing Pills is extraordinary; all of them are of peak quality. Even for grand cultivators in the Late-Stage Qi Condensation realm, it offers considerable benefits."

As her words fell, a delicate-looking mortal maid walked onto the stage, carrying a wooden tray. Placed on the tray was precisely the bottle of Yuan-Enhancing Pills that Wei Gan had provided.

"This bottle contains twelve Yuan-Enhancing Pills. The entire bottle will be auctioned off, with a starting bid of twenty low-grade spirit stones. Each subsequent bid must not be less than one low-grade spirit stone," Fairy Ziluó said with a beaming smile.

No sooner had she finished speaking than someone placed a bid.

"Twenty-five low-grade spirit stones!"

Before Fairy Ziluó could say anything, another voice immediately called out, "Twenty-seven low-grade spirit stones!"

"Thirty low-grade spirit stones!"

The auction price for this bottle of Yuan-Enhancing Pills soared, quickly breaking past fifty spirit stones.

In a private room on the second floor of the auction house, Tie Xiangguang, the artifact forging master, looked at the continuous bidding below and asked in confusion: "Yuan-Enhancing Pills, even if they are of peak quality, their medicinal effects are only on par with ordinary pills that can advance the spiritual power of Late-Stage Qi Condensation cultivators. Why are they so sought after?"

Gongyang Yan stroked his beard and replied, "If they were ordinary pills for advancing spiritual power in Late-Stage Qi Condensation cultivators, they naturally wouldn't incite such a fierce competition. This old man believes it's primarily because peak quality pills contain less pill toxins. For those cultivators who aspire to break through to a higher realm, this is likely what they value." The 'higher realm' Gongyang Yan spoke of naturally referred to the Foundation Establishment realm.

While they conversed, the bidding on the floor continued. Ultimately, this bottle of pills was won by an elder of the Iron Sword Sect for a price of eighty-five spirit stones.

"Hmm, the elder leading the Iron Sword Sect seems to be Fellow Daoist Tian. At forty-eight years old, he already has a cultivation of Qi Condensation Layer Eight," Gongyang Yan introduced him to Wei Gan. "He is also the cultivator within the Iron Sword Sect with the greatest hope of advancing to Foundation Establishment."

Wei Gan was extremely perceptive, and immediately sensed something from Gongyang Yan's special treatment towards him. *Is he trying to befriend me?*

There's no such thing as unprovoked kindness in this world. Wei Gan only had to think for a moment to understand the reason. This old fellow must have known whose hands the Yuan-Enhancing Pills currently being auctioned had come from. However, this was also exactly what Wei Gan wanted. Although Wei Gan had read hundreds, even thousands, of various books, his knowledge was insufficient in front of an old scholar like Gongyang Yan. Furthermore, there were some pieces of information, such as various intelligence about the small sect like the Iron Sword Sect, that Wei Gan knew nothing about. At this point, having Gongyang Yan introduce things was quite convenient.

Therefore, Wei Gan also returned Gongyang Yan's goodwill with a smile, occasionally chatting with him and exchanging opinions on the auction items. The two of them were deep in conversation, while Tie Xiangguang in the private room felt quite out of place and very awkward. He wanted to interject, but he was clumsy with words, and when it came to matters outside of artifact forging, while not entirely ignorant, his knowledge was 'very limited,' so he simply couldn't chime in.

On the high platform, the auction continued. Items were brought up one after another like flowing water, and their ownership was quickly determined amidst the cultivators' bids. Then, the next item would be presented. Peak quality items like the Yuan-Enhancing Pill were few; the vast majority of auction items had final prices between twenty and fifty spirit stones. Even so, the total sum of hundreds of auction items was a very substantial figure. At least, it was for most of those present.

"The next item is a first-grade, high-quality longbow artifact." As Fairy Ziluó introduced it, a spirited woman in a fitted outfit, holding a powerful iron-core bow, walked onto the high platform. "This artifact, during its forging, accidentally gained a special characteristic called 'Eagle Eye.'"

"As for its effect..." Fairy Ziluó teased, then remained silent.

The next moment, several tall, strong servants carried a target onto the high platform. All the cultivators in the hall immediately had their attention piqued. *Was there going to be a live demonstration?*

The target was placed a hundred paces away. The spirited woman holding the longbow artifact allowed a maid to blindfold her, then drew the bow, nocked an arrow, and aimed at the distant target.

"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!" Several arrows flew forth, embedding themselves firmly in the center of the target.

"There's nothing special about this artifact," the cultivators below muttered, disappointed that the performance on stage wasn't anything flashy.

"Heh, ignorant youngsters," Gongyang Yan said, stroking his beard again.

Those who didn't use their brains were, after all, a minority. Soon, many rogue cultivators realized the problem: *This woman... she's just a mortal!*
