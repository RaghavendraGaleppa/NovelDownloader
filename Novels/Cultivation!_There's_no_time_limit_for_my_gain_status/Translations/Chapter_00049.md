# Chapter 49: The Underwater Graveyard

Jiang Li successfully cast the Five Connections Technique for the first time after six hours of practice. This was merely the most basic level of imitation, proving that his comprehension attribute wasn't particularly impressive. 

His initial attempt at the technique was far from perfect—only two of the five senses were connected, and the effect lasted a mere three seconds. However, the sudden appearance of the status bar and the clearly perceptible connection target filled him with joy. 

As expected, the Seed Puppet Technique, which offered a stronger connection effect, could serve as a sensory node for the Five Connections Technique. That was more than enough.

Jiang Li cast the technique again. Once the status bar displayed [Five Senses Connection], he tapped the plus sign, extending the duration to 63 seconds. A single tap added a minute, while holding it for five seconds made the effect permanent.

[Five Senses Connection: Eyes and ears connected, duration ∞] (-)

With the connection now stable and unbreakable, Jiang Li was satisfied. Two senses out of five were better than nothing. The mouth and nose were of little use to a zombie anyway, and mastering the fifth sense—the tongue—would take far more time than he currently had. 

Without further delay, he submerged his consciousness, linking his vision and hearing to the Black Zombie, his only sensory node. It was as if he had gained an extra pair of eyes and ears. The overlapping sensory input caused a brief moment of disorientation. 

Since he wasn't yet skilled at multitasking, Jiang Li had to focus most of his attention on the zombie's perspective. 

The world through the zombie's eyes was murky and dim, the sound of rushing water pressing against its eardrums like distant drumbeats. Compared to his own diving experience, the sensations were slightly duller but not drastically different. 

The Black Zombie lay motionless, floating peacefully in the water, undisturbed. But when Jiang Li made it flip over and look around, the scene before him was nothing like before. 

The turbid river was now filled with countless flickering wisps of ghostly green fire. Beneath the zombie's feet, bleached bones, bloated corpses, and dismembered limbs covered the riverbed like fallen leaves in a forest—layer upon layer, endless in number. 

In terms of sheer scale, this underwater graveyard dwarfed the outer sect's burial grounds by ten, even a hundredfold.

**"This... How is this possible?"** 

Jiang Li's real body opened its eyes and rushed to the riverbank, peering into the water. Yet, he saw nothing. The Yin-Yang Bamboo arranged in formation along the river's surface showed no signs of disturbance either. 

This made no sense. According to his senses, the graveyard should be right here. Moreover, during his earlier underwater exploration, he hadn't encountered a single corpse in this slow-moving stretch of the river. 

Why couldn't he see anything from the surface, while the zombie had stumbled into this place simply by lying there? 

Was this a realm only accessible to the dead? 

Jiang Li's expression shifted several times before he finally untied his belt and relieved himself into the river. With a satisfied nod, he returned to his meditation. 

Redirecting his focus to the Black Zombie, he attempted to make it swim upward—a difficult task for a stiff corpse. After several failed attempts, Jiang Li gave up and instead guided the zombie deeper into the graveyard. 

Step by step, the zombie trudged through the sea of bones. Night vision was no issue for the undead, and the ghostly fires provided ample illumination. 

As he advanced, Jiang Li noticed something astonishing—a species of fish thriving in this yin-infested underwater wasteland. 

They were hideous deep-sea lanternfish, feeding on the rotting corpses below. Each bore a tiny glowing lantern on its forehead, casting faint light as they drifted through the water like specters. 

"Are these Ghost Lantern Fish? I recall ancient texts mentioning them as extinct since antiquity. Who knew they'd still exist here?" 

The Black Zombie pressed onward, trudging through the silent abyss like a lost traveler in an endless desert. 

Unbeknownst to Jiang Li, an entire day and night had passed. 

Elder Weng Sanqi received another message via the communication spirit stone, bearing good news. 

The sect's flying ship had arrived at the capital of Yinnan Kingdom and successfully retrieved the two thousand children. 

Upon arrival, the city was in chaos—rogue cultivators had been causing havoc, intending to loot and flee. But the flying ship descended from the skies, swiftly executing the troublemakers. 

Unfortunately, two of the seven outer sect disciples had perished in the skirmish. 

Naturally, such minor losses meant little to an elder like Weng Sanqi. The fact that he considered this "good news" spoke volumes. 

After thorough inspections by the sect's experts, it was confirmed—all the children possessed spiritual roots! 

Elder Weng couldn't hide his delight. He sought out Jiang Li, praising him and promising rewards, even mentioning putting in a commendation for his contributions. 

During this time, the other inner sect disciples stationed with Elder Weng occasionally returned. They found it odd that an outer sect disciple spent all his time meditating, but they didn't pry. 

Each time they rested, they only meditated briefly before setting out again in small boats, seemingly with clear objectives. 

Many more hours passed. 

The Black Zombie had been walking in a single direction. 

Finally, Jiang Li noticed a change—the ghostly fires grew denser. 

Any change was welcome. He adjusted the zombie's path several times, and soon, even the undead body could sense the thickening yin energy. 

The most obvious sign was the gradual disappearance of bones, replaced by perfectly preserved corpses that looked as if they had just died. 

This was intriguing. 

Jiang Li was now certain that this underwater graveyard was the hiding place of the Corpse Demon. The only question was—what secrets did it hold? 

Pressing forward, Jiang Li spotted a coffin floating in the distance, surrounded by countless ghostly fires like a moon encircled by stars. 

Just then, his real body was shaken awake. 

Opening his eyes, he saw Elder Weng and several inner sect disciples standing before him. 

"Jiang Li, things might get dangerous soon. Move further back and stay away from the riverbank." 

"Elder, what's happening?" 

Jiang Li's gaze sharpened as he noticed the inner sect disciples and dozens of wooden puppets behind Elder Weng—each carrying multiple corpses. 

Some were beasts, others humans, but all shared one common trait: their bodies were completely covered in talismans. 

Apparently, he wasn't the only clever one here.
