# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 115: Martial Cultivator Pill  

"Qin Yan was appointed as the next sect leader of Piaoyun Valley?"  

Lin Xuan's expression made Ma Tianxiong pause in surprise. Glancing at the cultivator before him, he cautiously asked, "Senior knows my junior sister?"  

"Not at all." Lin Xuan inwardly tensed but quickly feigned indifference. "I've never met the Cloudsoar Fairy in person, though I've heard of her reputation from friends. However, this Miss Qin seems to only be at the peak of the Lingdong Stage. How could she be named the future sect leader? Even if she rendered great service, this seems rather reckless. While Cloud Crane Zhenren's prestige in Piaoyun Valley is unmatched, he isn't one to act arbitrarily. This decision truly astonishes me."  

"Ah, so that's what puzzles you, Senior." Ma Tianxiong relaxed slightly. "You may not know, but Junior Sister Qin has already successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Stage."  

The news brought both surprise and joy to Lin Xuan, though his expression remained perfectly composed. He merely responded with a casual, "Oh?"  

Ma Tianxiong, however, continued eagerly, "Junior Sister Qin slew the Fire Spirit Sect Leader, rendering a great service. In reward, Sect Leader bestowed upon her a mid-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill. After three months in seclusion, she broke through to the Foundation Establishment Stage."  

A mid-grade pill?  

Lin Xuan inwardly sighed. Comparing oneself to others was truly disheartening. Over these past months, he had consumed countless mid-grade pills and even nearly a thousand high-grade ones—all to no avail. Only after braving countless dangers to obtain a furnace of heaven-defying supreme-grade pills had he barely managed to reach Foundation Establishment. And yet, Qin Yan...  

Suppressing his thoughts, he remarked lightly, "The Cloudsoar Fairy truly lives up to her reputation. With such talent, she would stand out even among the top sects of Youzhou."  

"Exactly!" Ma Tianxiong couldn't hide his envy. "Junior Sister Qin joined the sect later than I did, yet in just four years, she reached Foundation Establishment. Her speed even surpassed that of Cloud Crane Zhenren in his youth."  

Speaking of himself, Ma Tianxiong's mood darkened. Lin Xuan glanced at him—this man was also one of Piaoyun Valley's elite disciples. A year ago, he had been at the sixth layer of the Lingdong Stage, but now he had reached the peak.  

"Why be disheartened? Though you may not possess Qin Yan's genius, your talent is still exceptional. With effort, reaching Foundation Establishment is surely within your grasp."  

"Your kind words are appreciated, Senior." Ma Tianxiong forced a smile. "At just thirty years of age, I do have a chance at Foundation Establishment. However, Senior may not know—I took the path of martial cultivation..."  

"Martial cultivation? What of it?" Lin Xuan was genuinely puzzled. He knew Ma Tianxiong's background—originally a renowned young master in the secular martial world, he had later joined Piaoyun Valley by chance.  

Using his martial arts as a foundation, he had forged a unique path into cultivation.  

Logically, while such a path might prevent him from forming a Golden Core, reaching Foundation Establishment should have been assured. Yet, why did he seem so troubled?  

"The inner energy I cultivated in the secular world was formidable, but it had a fatal flaw. It wasn't apparent during the first six layers of the Lingdong Stage, but now that I've reached the peak, it has become an obstacle to Foundation Establishment."  

"Such a thing exists?" Lin Xuan was speechless. Then again, the path of cultivation was fraught with hardships. Countless cultivators had stumbled due to minor flaws.  

With a sympathetic glance, he asked, "What do you plan to do?"  

Most people in such a situation would despair, but since Ma Tianxiong had come to Spirit Medicine Mountain, he clearly had another plan.  

"After learning of this, I was disheartened for a time. But later, an elder in our sect offered guidance." Ma Tianxiong's expression brightened slightly. "That elder had also taken the path of martial cultivation and, coincidentally, encountered the same bottleneck. Yet, he eventually succeeded in reaching Foundation Establishment."  

"So, you've found a solution?"  

"According to the elder, to eliminate this flaw, I must consume a specific pill." Ma Tianxiong stole a glance at Lin Xuan before continuing, "It's called the Martial Cultivator Pill—useless to ordinary cultivators, but perfect for those who took the martial path."  

"And so you came to Spirit Medicine Mountain..."  

"Senior guessed correctly." A glimmer of hope appeared on Ma Tianxiong's face. "I went through great hardships to gather all the ingredients for the Martial Cultivator Pill. However, refining it is extremely difficult—none of the alchemists in Yanzhou were confident. Later, the elder mentioned that the pill he had taken was refined by an expert from your sect."  

"I see." Lin Xuan pondered for a moment before saying, "Since fate has brought us together, hand over the ingredients. Return tomorrow at this time to collect the pill."  

Overjoyed, Ma Tianxiong had been wondering how to ask for Lin Xuan's help—only for the latter to offer first.  

Profusely thanking him, Ma Tianxiong hurriedly handed over the ingredients.  

After seeing him off, Lin Xuan entered the alchemy chamber alone. Surveying the materials in his hand, he noted that many were rare treasures.  

For a peak Lingdong Stage cultivator like Ma Tianxiong to gather these, he must have endured great hardships—that much was certain.  

Lin Xuan's decision to help wasn't impulsive, nor was it out of nostalgia for their shared past in Piaoyun Valley.  

Truthfully, he held little affection for Piaoyun Valley. But this Senior Brother Ma had genuinely helped him on multiple occasions.  

Most cultivators were opportunistic, but Ma Tianxiong was warm-hearted. If not for him, Lin Xuan might have been exposed the first time he disguised himself as Ye Tian to enter the Elite Pavilion.  

Moreover, when Lin Xuan had sought information on supreme-grade pills and faced repeated rejections, it was Ma Tianxiong who had ultimately provided the answers.  

Lin Xuan wasn't a saint—he lived by the creed of repaying harm tenfold.  

But neither was he wicked. He wouldn't provoke others needlessly, and if someone had shown him kindness, he would repay it when possible.  

Within his means, of course.  

As for the Martial Cultivator Pill—given the standards of Yanzhou's cultivation world, refining it was indeed challenging. Even in Spirit Medicine Mountain, only a handful of alchemists could guarantee success.
