# Chapter 117: Refining Three Qi Simultaneously, Foundation Establishment! Foundation Establishment!

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

A peculiar scene unfolded on Jinyuan Island.

Disciples from noble families, the Seven Veins, and common backgrounds all gathered outside a cave dwelling on the island. The noble disciples arrived with entourages of attendants and beautiful maids, their jewels and treasures gleaming brilliantly. The Seven Veins disciples held grand gifts, waiting quietly, while even the common disciples carried bulging storage pouches as they converged.

These three distinct factions had gathered simultaneously, crowding the area before the cave dwelling to the point of being impassable.

"Brother Su, your elder brother was the mastermind behind the plot against Senior Brother Gu. How dare you show your face here to beg for spiritual qi?" 

With so many gathered from different factions, conflicts were inevitable. Someone in the crowd, seeing a young man in "Su family robes," couldn't help but sneer.

"My brother is my brother, and I am I. How can the two be conflated? I've come to apologize to Senior Brother Gu on behalf of my brother!" 

The Su family youth waved his sleeve dismissively as he spoke.

"Ugh, utterly shameless! Failing to harm Senior Brother Gu and still daring to show up—do you really think Senior Brother Gu has no temper and will just indulge you noble disciples?" 

Among the common disciples, someone couldn't hold back their anger and shouted.

They had thought that after Senior Brother Gu's decisive victory, common disciples would finally see better days. Yet, these noble and Seven Veins disciples had the audacity to come begging for spiritual qi as if nothing had happened, even after their previous conflicts with Senior Brother Gu.

"Are we not all disciples of the same sect? Can there truly be such deep grudges?" 

"Exactly! My brother is my brother, and I am I. My brother doesn't represent the Zhou family. Today, I've come under orders from my elders to build a good relationship with Senior Brother Gu. Let bygones be bygones!" 

Many from the noble families and Seven Veins spoke up, their attitudes noticeably humble.

This spectacle left the common disciples fuming.

Where was their arrogance? 

Where was their dignity? 

Weren’t they the ones who used to look down on everyone? Why were they now shedding all pretense of pride to compete with us? 

Have some backbone, will you?!

The common disciples glared at the noble disciples indignantly. 

But the noble disciples remained unmoved, merely directing their servants to pile up treasures before the cave dwelling as they quietly awaited Gu Yuan's emergence from seclusion.

Even the proudest of men would bow their heads when faced with the prospect of three hundred years of life.

After Gu Yuan's triumphant return, the noble and Seven Veins disciples had first seethed with anger, then quickly shifted to panic, worry, and fear.

---

Many disciples, especially those not from direct bloodlines, had rushed to Qian Yuan Cave even before their families could issue orders. 

They dared not gamble on whether their families could secure spiritual qi for them. The best course of action now was to seek Gu Yuan's forgiveness, obtain the spiritual qi, and break through to Foundation Establishment.

This was the Dao Academy's design—the strong grew stronger. As long as one was powerful enough, wealth, influence, and followers would come like the tide.

Grudges? 

Qian Yuan Cave had now become the focal point of the Dao Academy's storm.

Countless people awaited Gu Yuan's emergence from seclusion.

Yet, there were also those who watched coldly from the sidelines, secretly hoping Gu Yuan would fail in his breakthrough and perish.

---

But all of this had nothing to do with Gu Yuan.

Barefoot and with his hair loose, he sat cross-legged beneath the Little Giant Divine Tree for an entire month.

During this time, he did nothing but calm his mind, dispel distractions, and focus entirely on comprehending the Three Methods Heavenly Man True Diagram.

With the Three Hearts Seal enhancing his understanding, he could grasp any technique with ease. But when it came to Foundation Establishment, he remained cautious, ensuring no detail was overlooked.

"It's time…"

Gu Yuan slowly opened his eyes, sensing that his essence, qi, and spirit had reached their peak, and exhaled a turbid breath.

"Whoosh!"

"Clang!"

"Shh!"

With a wave of his sleeve, three strands of spiritual qi—azure, golden, and cyan—floated within the cave dwelling.

The Azure Sea Tide, Great Sun Golden Metal, and Verdant Wood Profound Spirit—these three strands of qi hovered restlessly, refusing to merge. When they collided in the air, the resulting shockwaves made the entire cave tremble slightly.

For ordinary cultivators attempting Foundation Establishment, only one strand of spiritual qi could be refined. 

Refining three simultaneously would cause the conflicting foundations to clash, a perilous endeavor.

Yet Gu Yuan hesitated not at all. He opened his mouth and inhaled, drawing all three strands into his body.

"Boom!"

The immense forces collided violently—golden swords gleamed, verdant wood resonated, and azure waves surged. The three distinct types of spiritual qi tangled like colliding stars, their terrifying power causing Gu Yuan's meridians to quake violently. His mana churned uncontrollably, and thin streaks of blood seeped from his skin.

For most cultivators, refining spiritual qi involved absorbing it into the body, merging it with their mana, and solidifying their foundation—a natural progression.

But Gu Yuan was refining three qi at once, forces as incompatible as fire and water. A single misstep could mean death!

Excruciating pain wracked his body, as if he were being torn apart. Yet his expression remained utterly composed, as though the agony were mere illusion.

All his focus was on his mana.

"Whoosh!"

To refine three foundations simultaneously, one needed mana surpassing ordinary limits!

Now, Gu Yuan's mana—three times that of a typical cultivator—surged forth like a furnace, enveloping the three strands of spiritual qi.

"Bang! Bang! Bang!"

The qi, possessing a will of its own, resisted merging and struggled fiercely to escape.

But Gu Yuan's mana, dense as cast iron, formed an unyielding crucible that trapped the three strands.

"Clang!"

"Whoosh!"

The spiritual qi thrashed endlessly, its power seemingly inexhaustible. Even with his superior mana, Gu Yuan found it difficult to subdue all three strands.

His mana reserves dwindled, showing signs of collapse.

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan activated the Little Giant Divine Seal in his dantian. The spiritual qi of Qian Yuan Cave surged toward him like a tide, replenishing his mana endlessly.

"Boom!"

His mana swelled, and the "furnace" grew even sturdier. Though the three strands of qi still struggled, they could no longer break free, firmly imprisoned within.

Seeing this, a glimmer of joy finally appeared in Gu Yuan's eyes. Without delay, he began visualizing the Three Methods Heavenly Man True Diagram.

Azure seas, a blazing sun, verdant wood—these mystical scenes arose in his mind. Simultaneously, golden threads materialized on the mana-forged "furnace." His mana, carrying the three strands of qi, began flowing along an arcane trajectory, resembling swimming dragons or orbiting stars.

Profound beyond words.

A mysterious power manifested in the void, drawing boundless spiritual qi into Gu Yuan's dantian like kindling fueling the furnace.

The fire of the Dao birthed the crucible, forging the arcane.

Yet the spiritual qi of Qian Yuan Cave seemed insufficient to sustain such vast consumption, showing signs of depletion.

Gu Yuan remained unperturbed. A crimson gemstone floated before him, radiating endless scarlet light that transformed into an unimaginable surge of spiritual qi, flooding into his body like flames.

Time flowed steadily. The three strands of qi, like fish in the furnace, began to merge slowly.

The phantom of a singular, extraordinary foundation gradually took shape.

Azure seas stretching eternally, a blazing sun singing with the resonance of swords!
