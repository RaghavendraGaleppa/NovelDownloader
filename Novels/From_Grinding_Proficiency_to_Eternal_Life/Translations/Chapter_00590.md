# Chapter 590: Yang Jian of the Heavenly Realm

The Star Soul Banner flickered repeatedly, its ethereal light shifting unpredictably.

Xu Yunfan roamed the Heavenly Realm, clutching the Star Soul Banner.

A Heavenly Realm Snow Soul Fairy, who was attempting to use Nine Nether Cold Essence to freeze a hundred miles of ruins to hide herself, had her protective cold light shattered by a Thunder Finger. She let out a piercing shriek as she was sucked into the banner.

A Gu Immortal old monster, who controlled a Ten Thousand Poison Golden Toad and spat out seven-colored toxic mist in an attempt to poison every living being he encountered, had his toxic essence body violently shattered by Purple Gold Thunder Aura. The Golden Toad, along with his soul, became the Poison Toad Star Lord within the Star Banner.

There were also those barefoot immortals hiding deep within the Yao Pool ruins, which had turned into a lake of magma, attempting to refine the remaining spiritual water of the immortals to heal their injuries. Xu Yunfan found them by tracking their faint spiritual energy fluctuations. With a sweep of the Star Banner, they, along with a pool of murky water, were completely devoured.

Xu Yunfan grew more and more delighted as he darted about. The Heavenly Realm was on the verge of being devoured, and the Heavenly Dao was also gradually shattering and disintegrating. Many profound Dao principles were intuitively presented before his eyes.

This was an exceptionally rare opportunity.

As time passed, Xu Yunfan's harvests were plentiful. The starlight within the Star Soul Banner grew increasingly brilliant, and the trajectories of the stars gradually took on the semblance of a nascent grand array.

Xu Yunfan was like a diligent miner, silently mining for wealth on the very edge of the chaotic battlefield.

Until this day.

Xu Yunfan had just used lightning speed to suppress a Heavenly Realm Star Official near the ruins of an observatory that still retained the fluctuations of a dimensional-breaking array. The official was holding a star compass and attempting to use the residual array to counterattack.

Just as he put away the Star Soul Banner and prepared to escape into the shadows of the next location...

"Foreign Demon! How dare you harm the officials of my Heavenly Realm!"

A stern shout, like a thunderclap from a clear sky, pierced through the air, carrying an incomparable sharpness.

Xu Yunfan's heart chilled, and he spun around sharply.

A hundred zhang away, atop a pile of stones formed by the collapse of glazed jade pillars, a majestic figure stood tall.

The man wore a Three Mountains Flying Phoenix Crown, Silver Chain Mail, and an outer black battle robe. He held a three-pointed, double-edged spear that emitted a chilling light and had an ancient design.

His face was resolute, his eyes like lightning. What was most striking was the slightly closed vertical mark on his forehead, which contained a divine light, radiating a heart-palpitating power of insight and the ability to see through illusions.

A magnificent battle intent, at the mid Foundation Establishment realm, mixed with an extremely pure martial will and immortal spiritual power, firmly locked onto Xu Yunfan.

This battle intent was incredibly pure and condensed, far surpassing the True Immortals he had encountered before. It seemed to have been tempered through countless battles of blood and fire, a completely sublimated version of martial arts.

*Quite interesting.*

Xu Yunfan's eyes shone as he swept his gaze over the three-pointed, double-edged spear and the vertical eye on the forehead. A name that was like thunder in his previous life's mythology instantly jumped into his mind.

"Yang Jian?"

He wasn't surprised by the appearance of Yang Jian. After all, this Heavenly Realm had a Jade Emperor and a Heavenly Empress, so it wasn't strange to have more legendary figures. The young god-general he had encountered earlier was also called Nezha, wasn't he?

But such distinct features, so directly corresponding to that name, still caused a faint ripple of anomaly in his heart.

*Why are there so many things like this that seem familiar yet different?*

The god-general holding the three-pointed, double-edged spear heard these words, and his pupils constricted violently. The vertical mark on his forehead seemed to fluctuate intensely as he shouted harshly.

"Who are you?! How do you know my name?!"

Xu Yunfan's mind raced, but a barely perceptible, sly smile appeared on his face. His tone was calm, as if he were stating an unimportant matter, speaking slowly and deliberately.

"When I first broke into the Heavenly Realm, I casually dealt with an arrogant brat who didn't know the immensity of heaven and earth. He rode two fiery wheels and wielded a fire-spitting spear."

"He said before he died that the Heavenly Second Lord Yang Jian was his brother and would surely avenge him, and so on."

"Tsk, so noisy. I casually crushed his soul."

His words were half true, half false. The name Nezha came from his memories of his previous life, and he had casually used it as bait to enrage the other party.

The effect was immediate.

"You were the one who killed Nezha?!"

"Give me your life!!!"

Yang Jian's eyes were about to split from fury.

The end of the world had already tainted the spirits of the creatures in this realm with a sense of decline. Xu Yunfan's words instantly ignited all the grief, anger, and killing intent in his heart.

The long-closed vertical eye on his forehead suddenly snapped open.

*Hum!*

A beam of light, condensed to the extreme and as brilliant as a blazing sun, instantly tore through space. Carrying a terrifying power capable of incinerating all things and seeing through the origin, it shot straight toward Xu Yunfan's brow.

This was the Golden Light of the Heavenly Eye's Insight!

Simultaneously, the ground beneath his feet cracked inch by inch. His entire body transformed into a silver dragon that tore through the void. The three-pointed, double-edged spear划破 the long sky. Before the tip of the blade even arrived, the tyrannical and sharp sword intent, as if it could split a ten-thousand-zhang divine mountain in two, had already locked onto Xu Yunfan in advance.

"Die for me!!!"

His voice shook the universe. The golden-red beam of light was as fast as an aurora, arriving before the spear! The blade aura was like a bolt of silk,劈开 the heavens and the earth.

Xu Yunfan let out a cold snort, a hint of solemnity and excitement flashing in his eyes.

The combat power at the peak of the mid Foundation Establishment realm, and the opponent was purely on the path of martial combat. This was just right for him to test his late Foundation Establishment realm strength.

If he could incorporate Yang Jian into the Star Soul Banner, he would definitely be a formidable banner spirit.

Facing the golden-red beam of light that pierced through the air, as if it could penetrate the soul, the nascent proto-world within his sea of consciousness, which was already stable and rotating ceaselessly, trembled slightly. A sense of a solid barrier, originating from the foundation of a world, instantly fortified his soul.

His spiritual sense was like bedrock, unshakable.

The Golden Light of Insight shot onto it, like a scorching sun burning against solid ice. Although it stirred a violent fluctuation in the soul, it failed to truly harm Xu Yunfan's foundation.

Almost in the same instant he withstood the golden light, Xu Yunfan moved.

He did not choose to clash head-on with the peerlessly sharp three-pointed, double-edged spear. His figure swayed slightly, and arcs of lightning spontaneously ignited, as if he had merged with the turbulent energy currents surging beneath his feet. He disappeared from his original location in the blink of an eye, leaving only a faint purple afterimage behind, which was instantly shredded to pieces by the blade aura.

*BOOM!*

Yang Jian's strike missed, landing where Xu Yunfan had been standing. The violent force was unleashed, reducing the already dilapidated observatory ruins to complete dust. It left a bottomless, massive blade mark, and even caused the space to distort violently.

"Hm?"

Yang Jian's heart trembled. The other party had actually dodged his fatal strike so easily.

His combat experience was incredibly rich. Without hesitation, the golden light of his Heavenly Eye swept again, like a searchlight scanning the void. At the same time, his wrist flicked, and the three-pointed, double-edged spear drew out countless illusory and real silver webs of blades that sealed off the space in all directions.

"You Heavenly Realm immortals with strong combat power all seem to enjoy close-quarters combat so much. Your martial arts are indeed exquisite, a pity..."

Xu Yunfan's voice carried a hint of inquiry, as if a phantom had appeared on a broken wall ten zhang to Yang Jian's left.

"...when facing the path of spell and divine ability techniques, you seem to lack the strength. Though the path of using one force to break ten thousand methods and achieving sainthood through the physical body is good, it is ultimately difficult to master."

Yang Jian spun around, glaring with furious eyes. His sword intent turned again, sweeping forward like a storm.

"Demon of the foreign path! You dare not face me in a direct battle, only knowing how to scurry and hide like a rat, and you dare to criticize the battle methods of my Heavenly Realm?!"
