# Chapter 354: Integration of Truth

A deafening explosion shattered the silence as the purple qi in the old Taoist's brow suddenly detonated.

Amidst the shattered purple light, a surging aura of Dragon and Tiger True Qi began to rise, taking on a nascent form. Seeing this, the two old Taoists beside him let out a muffled grunt and channeled their own Dragon and Tiger True Qi into the mix.

"Roar!"

First, a tiger's roar that shook the nine heavens echoed from the void, the shockwave causing everyone's hearts to tremble. Immediately after, a long dragon's cry responded, as if the winds and clouds were changing, dark clouds churning like furious waves.

In the eyes of the stunned crowd, the True Qi behind the old Taoist materialized, revealing a colossal Dharma Form.

The Dharma Form stood over three zhang tall. The left half was that of a White Tiger, its snow-white fur flowing with the energy of Geng Metal; the right half was that of a Green Dragon, its azure scales shining with the light of Yi Wood.

It possessed a tiger's head and a dragon's horns, its dragon eyes radiating authority. Dragon and Tiger Vital Energy, as solid as substance, coiled around its body, each strand containing devastating power.

"A Martial Dao Dharma Form? I didn't expect your Xuanzhen Sect to have seen the Xuantian Baolu, and to have actually managed to cultivate a Dharma Form."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with a sharp light. The Ten Extremities True Qi in his palm transformed into a vortex, actually unraveling and devouring the Dragon and Tiger Vital Energy from the newly formed Dragon and Tiger Heavenly尊 Dharma Form.

He was familiar with Dragon and Tiger Pill Qi. He had also read the Xuantian Baolu and naturally knew its flaws.

The Dharma Form instantly collapsed. The three old Taoists screamed as they fell to the ground, their blood and energy bursting apart. The backlash from the Dharma Form had directly destroyed their blood energy!

Xu Yunfan took a single step forward. The bluestone beneath his feet exploded, and his figure turned into a shadow that tore through the void.

Layers of airwaves burst in the atmosphere. Before the Xuanzhen Sect old Taoist could even react, darkness suddenly fell before his eyes. Xu Yunfan's palm had already descended like a collapsing sky, his five fingers clamping down on the top of the old Taoist's head, the Ten Extremities True Qi enveloping his skull.

"This cultivation of yours is already ruined, so why not give it to me."

Before the words had fully faded, the old Taoist's body trembled violently. Wisps of green smoke spilled from his seven orifices. The Dragon and Tiger True Qi he had painstakingly cultivated for two sixty-year cycles was now surging out from his Baihui acupoint like a bursting dam.

Xu Yunfan's palm buzzed as the Mixed Origin True Seed spun rapidly, tearing the incoming Dragon and Tiger Qi apart. The Tiger's Evil Vital Energy was refined into crimson flowing fire by the Ten Extremities True Qi, while the Dragon Qi was transformed into a dark blue water mist.

The old Taoist's face visibly withered, his skin rapidly cracking to reveal the dried-up blood vessels underneath, as if he were a clay figurine weathering away.

What was even more terrifying were the scattered remnants of True Qi. Whenever a strand of Dragon and Tiger True Qi tried to escape, fine scale patterns would appear on Xu Yunfan's skin, like thousands of hungry little mouths, devouring the stray energy until nothing remained.

The Black Tortoise Armor beneath the old Taoist's robe made a cracking sound unable to bear the strain. This life-bound magic tool was also drained of its spiritual nature, its scales crumbling into dust.

After three breaths, Xu Yunfan withdrew his hand and shook it lightly, a handful of bone dust sprinkling from his fingers.

The now empty shell of a body collapsed to the ground, shattering into powder the moment it touched the floor. A gust of wind swept it away, leaving nothing behind. Only the scorched tiger claw prints and dragon-shaped water stains left on the ground proved that a Ninth Realm Grandmaster had fallen here.

*You have absorbed a massive amount of Dragon and Tiger True Qi. Your total quantity of Ten Extremities Martial Dao True Qi has increased significantly. You have reached the limit of a hundred years of cultivation.*

He glanced at the message floating on the attribute panel in his vision.

There was no time to look closely. Sensing the True Qi surging within him once more, Xu Yunfan raised his head and looked at the remaining two Xuanzhen old Taoists, revealing a chilling grin.

The Ten Extremities True Qi within him churned like a raging sea. The True Qi he had just absorbed had yet to be fully refined, yet wisps of it were already bursting forth from his pores. He raised his head to look at the remaining two Xuanzhen Sect old Taoists, his white teeth faintly visible, like a ferocious beast selecting its prey.

The two old Taoists had not yet recovered from the shock of their fellow sect member's gruesome death when the scene before them blurred. Xu Yunfan's hands had already clamped onto the tops of their heads like iron pincers.

The Ten Extremities True Qi in his palms spun rapidly, actually forming a vortex of Dragon and Tiger struggling for dominance above their heads. The Dragon and Tiger True Qi the old Taoists had painstakingly cultivated for sixty years now scrambled to flee as if they had met their natural enemy. The Tiger's Evil Vital Energy turned into crimson flowing fire and gushed from their seven orifices, while the Dragon Vein's Mystic Qi condensed into dark blue mist and rose from their Baihui acupoints.

"Fellow Daoist... save me..."

The old Taoist on the left roared as he tried to form a Dragon and Tiger hand seal, but Xu Yunfan clenched his five fingers, shattering the incomplete秘武 (Secret Martial Art).

The old Taoist on the right fared worse. His protective Black Tortoise Armor cracked with a "kakaka" sound. Lifeblood seeped from the gaps between the scales, only to be drained instantly into dry scabs.

After three breaths, Xu Yunfan shook his sleeve and tossed aside the two empty shells. The bodies, once possessed of an immortal grace, now crumbled apart like weathered clay figurines, making a sound like the striking of jade and metal as they hit the ground—the final reaction of a body whose bones had been refined to a jade-like quality after having its Dragon and Tiger True Qi completely stripped away.

"..."

The inside of the barrier was now like a field of carnage.

Xu Yunfan swept a cold gaze over the only remaining people: the Lord of the Celestial Pivot Sword, three female cultivators from the Penglai Pavilion, the Xuanlin, and the two old eunuchs.

The Sword Lord suddenly tore open his shirt, revealing a sword-shaped birthmark on his chest that burst with a piercing cold light. "Xu Yunfan! Take one more step, and I will detonate the Celestial Pivot Sword Soul!"

Before the words were finished, he felt a chill at the back of his neck. Xu Yunfan had somehow appeared behind him. The Ten Extremities True Qi coiling around his fingertips actually mimicked the unique "Sword Qi Turning into Rain" characteristic of the Sword Pavilion, freezing the man instantly.

"Your lives are no longer yours to decide."

At this terrifying sight, the beautiful woman from the Penglai Pavilion let out a scream and tried to turn and flee, but Xu Yunfan grabbed at her from a distance. She discovered in horror that the True Qi in her body was leaking out like a bursting dam, yet Xu Yunfan hadn't even touched her skin. The effect of drawing in energy from a distance, a special feature of the Ten Extremities Martial Art's True Qi Absorption, was displayed here to its fullest!

On the Xuanwu Martial Stage, the moment the last wisp of True Qi pierced the old eunuch's brow, the entire stage fell into dead silence.

Looking around, the stage was unrecognizable. The bluestone ground was covered in spiderweb-like cracks, and a few deep pits still held the lingering shockwaves of True Qi, occasionally bursting with dazzling lightning.

The corpses of the Five Great Sects lay scattered everywhere. The entire stage reeked of pungent blood, mixed with the smell of scorched flesh and skin. Broken weapons and torn banners were strewn about, and a few flags embroidered with the sect emblems were still smoking.

The only living person standing, besides Xu Yunfan who stood with his hands behind his back, was the old steward he had deliberately left alive. The old man was slumped beside the wreckage of the judge's stand. The lower half of his official robe was soaked in blood, his aged fingers tightly clutching half of a科武 (Science and Martial Arts) register, his turbid eyes filled with dullness and numbness.

Xu Yunfan was surrounded by a murky aura of Ten Extremities True Qi, his body like a furnace constantly refining the various foreign True Qi. Occasionally, a strand of golden Buddhist Vital Energy could be seen trying to escape, only to be instantly shattered by the Mixed Origin True Seed. At other times, a few strands of dark blue Water-element True Qi would dart through his flesh and blood, only to be forcefully suppressed by his Ten Extremities Martial Art.

He raised his eyes to look at the kneeling Xuanlin. The Penglai Pavilion's Sea-Calming Emissary had none of his former prestige left. The fish-scale armor forged from ten-thousand-year-old black iron was cracking with a "kakaka" sound, and the glowing cloud patterns between the scales were extinguishing one by one.
