# Chapter 208: Nine Rebirths

The heavens and earth were engulfed in thick darkness. Sun Taichu stood on the clouds, his expression growing graver. He said, "It's not even limited to a few forbidden lands; it includes the entire Kunling Territory! If that's the case, it's truly terrifying. After all, Kunling is a legendary land. In ancient times, the murals carved on the stone cliffs of this territory were all related to the activities of near-immortal beings and god-like creatures, with various records and descriptions."

"The Esoteric Sect... what kind of monsters have they produced?" The person behind Sun Taichu suddenly felt a chill down their spine. Everyone said that the immortal path was brilliant, full of talents, and the lands beyond the secular world showed their strength. However, some paths had never been weak since ancient times. The Esoteric Sect had a frighteningly deep foundation, involved in various fields; the deeper one understood them, the more terrifying they would find them to be.

Sun Taichu's presence in Kunling was not purely for the auspicious beasts, but because he had sensed something. Now, just a slight probe had verified certain matters. The dark figure behind him whispered, "Is a brand new supreme expert rising?" Then, the dark figure suddenly looked up and said, "Or is it that the ancient gods are being reborn, with even grander ambitions..." Sun Taichu, born from pure yang consciousness and spiritual light, now parted the inky clouds, gazing towards the entire Kunling Territory, his eyes incredibly profound.

...

In the Secret Realm, deep within the mountain, Qin Ming was in a daze, his body burning hot, covered in scabs that resembled dragon scales, layer upon layer.

In a trance, he dreamed he had become a great serpent, repeatedly struck by thunderfire in a torrential downpour. Its scales peeled off, its body shattered, bloody. It constantly raised its head in defiance, yet constantly fell, unable to withstand the might of the thunderfire, until eventually, its entire body was scorched black, its bones fractured. After a long period of silence, a faint vitality emerged from its broken body, mixed with the extreme yang left by the thunderfire, slowly reviving it in an impossible, desperate situation. It tore open its old body, covered in blood, struggled free, and strove to transform into a dragon. But the process was incredibly difficult, full of hardship. On the verge of death, it burrowed deep underground to gasp for breath, entering a long slumber to accumulate strength.

Within the mountain's core, the layer of scabs on Qin Ming's body shattered, like a serpent shedding its skin, ushering in a new growth period. His Dragon-Serpent Force underwent a change. As the Dragon-Serpent Scripture circulated, the yin-attributed force became tinged with yang attributes, as if it had been struck by thunderfire, gaining faint traces of extreme yang vital energy. Of course, this was only a partial yin-yang transformation; most importantly, the newly born power was exceptionally dense, causing him to undergo a true metamorphosis.

After the scabs fell off Qin Ming's body, he had reached the extreme point, stepping into the edge and boundary of the ninth rebirth, and his physique began to improve. At this moment, the two fragmented demon seeds had long since been crushed, turning into streams of light, completely worn away. The Dragon-Serpent Force within him transformed into two tangible roots, one in the form of a serpent and the other a dragon, rooting themselves in the "soil" of the fragmented demon seeds, absorbing nutrients. Until finally, the demon seed "soil" exploded, turning heaven and earth upside down. They ceased to exist, their final dying struggle attempting to break the Dragon-Serpent roots.

Qin Ming's entire body ruptured once more, becoming a bloody mess, then new dragon-scale scabs formed again, like a serpentine dragon hibernating, latent, brewing vigorous vitality within. "The dragon fights in the wilderness, its blood is black and yellow..." This time, he dreamed of endless battles, incredibly brutal, as if he were personally participating, constantly fighting on the chaotic land. He moved, battling all the way in an era of bloodshed, his body shattering and reassembling, enduring axe blows, pierced by divine swords, and new thunderfire striking him. He courted death to live, constantly reassembling his flesh and blood in desperation, growing stronger again and again, finally ushering in a qualitative change, completely transforming. A dragon's roar echoed between heaven and earth, and he ascended into the sky.

Simultaneously, the dragon-scale scabs on Qin Ming's body burst open directly, scattered by a surge of virile power. Within his flesh and blood, a real dragon shadow actually appeared, ascending in the heavenly light, utterly astonishing. He fully awakened, the reborn power exceptionally dense, his entire body undergoing changes. He wasn't just reaching the edge of the ninth rebirth; he was striding right into it.

This rebirth was rapid and fierce, quite unusual. Golden threads intertwined on his body's surface, jade light flowed, quickly forming a golden-threaded jade robe that enveloped him. His physique continuously elevated, and his Sky-Light Force surged. Qin Ming was certain that he was in the ninth rebirth, and it didn't seem to need to last long. He perceived the changes within himself; in the past, he would only enhance his Sky-Light Force with fallen fruits, five-colored spiritual branches, and the like after a rebirth. Now, that wasn't necessary. Because his Dragon-Serpent Force had already elevated synchronously.

Moreover, before he officially broke through to the Outer Saint realm, he still had time to continue practicing the Golden Cicada Scripture and the Undying Butterfly Scripture, both of which could be integrated. As expected, Qin Ming's rebirth was nearing completion in less than half a day. He advanced using the Dragon-Serpent Scripture, his physique improving with extreme ferocity. Most crucially, his Sky-Light Force transformed along with it, gaining the rumored characteristics: domineering and even more potent strength. These were some of the traits of Patriarch Qingtian, who was once renowned throughout the Night Fog World, famed for his peerless divine strength, capable of propping up the heavens with his hands.

Clearly, the Dragon-Serpent Force, in its early stages, was a crucial part of his integration of various force methods, laying the foundation. This was one of the important miraculous techniques noted on the "true transmission single page." Qin Ming had already experienced various marvels even before integrating the Dragon-Serpent Force. Within his flesh, blood, and internal organs, a dragon-shaped light coiled, then soared, followed by a dragon's roar echoing throughout his body. Finally, it transformed into a rain of dragon-scale-like light, dispersing among his limbs and bones, completely merging with him. Qin Ming had the illusion he could uproot mountains!

"Alas, it's a pity this is only Patriarch Qingtian's most proficient domain, embodying ultimate rigidity and ferocity. If only I could have integrated the traits of the other patriarchs during this ninth rebirth." He focused on using the Dragon-Serpent Scripture for his metamorphosis to complete this rebirth; it was difficult to attend to other matters at the time.

"Everyone says that the ninth rebirth is not that simple; only prodigies can attempt it. Others stop after the seventh rebirth and can only consume great medicines to break into the Outer Saint realm before continuing their path." Furthermore, it was clearly recorded in books that the stronger a prodigy's initial foundation, the more terrifying the final burst of this rebirth would be.

Qin Ming pondered, how was his ninth rebirth different? He felt that although the improvement was fierce and he had become very strong, witnessing Patriarch Qingtian's past trajectory, it was still not as astonishing as his expectations. His innate talent was extraordinary, and the depth of his foundation would make even previous patriarchs envious; it should have been even more powerful.

Amidst Qin Ming's doubts, the ninth rebirth entered its final stage, bringing him a new ability. He felt a rush of warmth to his eyes, his vision immediately blurred, the scenery of heaven and earth indistinct. After a brief unease, he calmed down. He believed there shouldn't be any major error or negative change. A moment later, his vision recovered. As he walked out of the mountain's core, looking at this Secret Realm bathed in "twilight," everything appeared much clearer. When he concentrated, a warm current flowed through his eyes; the fine veins on the leaves in front of him, the crystal-clear dewdrops held by small blades of grass on distant mountains, all seemed to be right before his eyes, incredibly vivid. "Is it similar to a spiritual eye ability?" Qin Ming was surprised. He felt this ability should be more than just this, and it awaited further verification.

In the mountainous terrain, he unleashed his Dragon-Serpent Force. Instantly, this fierce power swept through like a colossal beast, causing strong winds to howl through the forest and the ground to tremble. He mused that if he were to encounter the silver-robed youth now, even if that person went mad and fully activated his fragmented demon seeds, Qin Ming would not be intimidated. Then, black and white light intertwined between his hands, accompanied by a series of dragon roars.

"Too bad, the Dragon-Serpent Scripture only involves a partial yin-yang transformation. However, the Golden Cicada Scripture also contains some true profoundness, which can be continuously refined later." Qin Ming prepared to integrate the Dragon-Serpent Force. His Sky-Light Force would undergo a transformation because of this, becoming even more terrifying.

"Hm?" Suddenly, he discovered something, falling into a daze. He could no longer see the glowing path, which made him frown. Undoubtedly, he had completely shattered and crushed the two fragmented demon seeds, selectively absorbing nutrients from their "soil," unlike the silver-robed youth who had fully integrated them.

"It doesn't matter. There's another person with a 'dual demon seed,' and he's looking for me. A tiger may intend to harm, but a man also has the will to hunt a tiger!" Qin Ming took a deep breath and began to integrate the Dragon-Serpent Force. This was not difficult; he was adept at controlling various methods using the Silk Scroll scriptures, and the sixth miraculous technique was quickly unifying!

Finally, with a thunderous boom, dragon shadows surged, and his dazzling Sky-Light Force gained another miraculous technique, becoming completely perfected. He felt his entire body brimming with explosive power. Every time he integrated a miraculous technique, his Sky-Light Force would undergo a qualitative improvement! Undoubtedly, this was the most fundamental and root cause of his skyrocketing combat power!

"Now, I've integrated six miraculous techniques. I'm not afraid of any legendary Sky-Light Force in the rebirth stage anymore," Qin Ming murmured to himself, possessing this confidence. In the rebirth stage, the highest achiever in the Six Imperial Ancestral Courtyard was one who bore the Three Imperial Forces, in the Tathagata Gate it was the Golden Body Nirvana practitioner, and in the Qingtian Sect, they were known as Heaven-Shakers.

Qin Ming tried his hand briefly, sweeping all before him, displaying ultimate rigidity and strength, carving a massive hole in the mountain wall! He was a little lost in thought; this improvement was truly astonishingly fierce!

"Alas!" He sighed again. There were nine opportunities in the rebirth stage, and now they were all used up. Could he still break through quickly once he reached the Outer Saint level? According to various sources, those undergoing rebirth would begin to "fall behind" after entering the second realm; some things were destined and couldn't be changed! The main reason was that their improvement speed couldn't keep up with other paths, and they would be swiftly surpassed and left behind until they could no longer see the backs of their peers. Qin Ming felt melancholy, pondering the future. Although he was very confident, the paths of the predecessors were laid out, the road ahead was rugged and difficult, with no light in sight. "I must cut through thorns and brambles, ensure this current state, and absolutely not let my cultivation speed drop," he said, his expression firm.

Suddenly, Qin Ming sensed something: his body was still faintly warm. Had the metamorphosis not completely ended? He carefully perceived it; faint traces of nascent vital energy were hidden within his physical body. The first phase of rebirth had indeed concluded, but it seemed to be still accumulating power! Qin Ming's eyes looked strange, then flickered like firelight. He gazed towards the distant forest. Was the top expert with the "dual demon seed" still looking for him? He murmured, "It seems I still have a chance to use the Golden Cicada Scripture to promote rebirth and explore certain domains that Tathagata excels in."

...

In the Secret Realm, in the area where the disciples of the Pure Land Beyond resided, many people were discussing heatedly. Because another person had "set off"! Li Qingxu, his feather robe like that of an immortal, holding a purple bamboo staff, was walking away along a glowing path, leaving behind an increasingly blurred silhouette. Many were surprised, envious, and jealous, as they recalled the rumored reasons for his ability to embark on this path, which had circulated for some time. "What if... he gets defeated and falls off that path? Then he'd lose face," someone among his former competitors whispered.
