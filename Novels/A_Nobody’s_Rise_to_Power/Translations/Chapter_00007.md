# Chapter 7: The True Culprit

Yang Can had provoked Leopard Head into provoking the Suo family. If the two sides were to engage in a major conflict, and the person who stepped in to mediate was still only that Tu Mammy, then Yang Can could confirm that Tu Mammy was the sole person in charge of this Suo family contingent.

If that were the case, as long as he could deal with Tu Mammy, there was a high chance he could seize the initiative and turn the tables.

At the same time, intensifying the conflict between the Yu family and the Suo family was nothing but beneficial to him in his current situation.

The people in the Suo family camp on the slope, seeing a group of Yu family guards shouting and rushing up the hill, immediately grew vigilant.

They quickly called out warnings to each other and began to gather together.

The death of Yu Chengye, the heir of the Yu family of Tianshui, had clearly affected many people. Yet everyone was trying to turn this influence to their own advantage, or at least prevent it from harming them.

But no one mourned Yu Chengye's death, not even his bride.

Perhaps, there was only one exception, and that person was currently on Phoenix Mountain.

Tianshui City, Phoenix Mountain.

There was a Yu family manor on Phoenix Mountain, named after the mountain: "Phoenix Mountain Manor."

The rising sun at this moment gilded the upturned eaves of the Phoenix Mountain Manor with a brilliant red.

The gates of the ancestral hall deep within the Yu family compound stood wide open. Brilliant sunlight slanted in from outside, illuminating the deep and spacious hall.

The memorial tablets on the offering table seemed to glow because of it.

This was the place for worshipping the ancestors of the Yu family.

The Yu clan had already lasted for three hundred and twenty-seven years. The glory and honor of these three hundred and twenty-seven years were created by the generations of Yu ancestors enshrined in this hall.

Yu Xinglong, the Patriarch of the Tianshui Yu family, held a brand-new memorial tablet in his hands, gently stroking the line of characters he had personally carved and gilded.

After a long while, he let out a sorrowful sigh. A tear fell with a "pat" onto the memorial tablet, slowly sliding into the groove of the character "Ye" (业).

Yu Xinglong lifted his sleeve and gently wiped the tear from the character "Ye," then carefully placed the tablet on the offering stand.

His tearful, elderly eyes gazed fixedly at his son's memorial tablet.

"Memorial Tablet for the Deceased Son, Chengye!" This form of wording was used when a father outlives his son, who is unmarried and childless.

Yu Xinglong was already in his fifties, his hair graying.

Although he was the Patriarch of the Tianshui family, holding high rank and great power, his appearance and temperament were as refined and scholarly as a learned gentleman.

Now, that refined face was tinged with a sense of tragedy.

Although the messenger sent by Leopard Head had taken a shortcut, he had not yet arrived, and the person sent by Tu Mammy naturally had not arrived either.

But Yu Xinglong had already placed his son's memorial tablet in the ancestral hall.

Because he knew his son was no longer in this world.

Before Yu Chengye went to Jincheng to fetch his bride, Yu Xinglong had already foreseen his son's death.

This was because the "bandits" who assassinated Yu Chengye were sent by him.

This was because the timing and method of Yu Chengye's death was a plan agreed upon by father and son, Yu Xinglong and Yu Chengye.

"Father," in Yu Xinglong's tearful vision, the figure of his eldest son, Yu Chengye, faintly appeared.

When Yu Chengye spoke these words, his eyes were terrifyingly calm, as if he were not discussing his own life and death, but an upcoming autumn hunt.

"I believe it is better to use this ruined body of mine to do something useful for our main lineage than to gasp for another half a year."

He took two steps back and knelt before Yu Xinglong. "I ask Father to arrange a marriage for me with another family, and then arrange an assassination on the way to fetch the bride, and frame my Second Uncle..."

"You stop right there! Utterly absurd!" Yu Xinglong immediately shouted to stop him, his whole body trembling.

But that was not out of anger; it was out of fear. He realized, to his shame, that he was tempted.

"We are running out of time, Father. If our main lineage does not curb Second Uncle now, we will never have a chance to turn the tables."

Yu Chengye gave a bitter smile. "My life is already short. Why not make good use of this opportunity?

We lack the strength to suppress the second branch, so we must borrow strength.

Use the marriage between two families as a link, and use my death as the pretext. We can use one force to strike another, suppressing the second branch while also deterring the other branches.

In this way, we can buy enough time for our second brother's growth."

Yu Chengye let out a soft laugh as he spoke. "Besides, the poisoned arrow I was hit with back then was most likely the work of my 'good' Second Uncle.

Although I am framing him with my death now, I might not be wronging him in the slightest."

"My son, my son..."

Yu Xinglong gently closed his eyes and called out sorrowfully.

After a long time, he raised his sleeve and gently wiped the tear stains from the corners of his eyes. Then he picked up three sticks of incense, lit them on the candle flame, and inserted them one by one into the incense burner.

Green smoke curled upwards, gradually blurring the gold characters on the memorial tablet.

Leopard Head led a group of people, their momentum fierce, and stormed into the center of the camp.

The bandit was tied hand and foot and placed on a large cart. He was curled up, half-dead, the dried blood on his clothes having turned a dark red.

"Halt! Who gave you permission to charge in here?" A group of Suo family guards met them without showing any weakness.

Leopard Head shouted sternly, "I am the captain of the guards for Young Master Yu! Today, I will interrogate this bandit to find their nest and avenge my young master!"

A Suo family guard sneered, "We will not hand him over to you. How he is dealt with is the Suo family's responsibility."

"The one who died was a young master of my Yu family!"

"So what?"

The Suo family guard raised his head arrogantly. "Without orders from our Tu Mammy, no one is allowed to approach!"

As he spoke, his hand had already rested on his sword hilt, his gaze cold.

Leopard Head flew into a rage. "Am I to understand that you are shielding the murderer and deliberately stalling for time, so the murderer can escape?"

Leopard Head's large eyes flashed with ferocity. Although the Suo family was powerful, with his own life on the line, he no longer cared about so many things.

The Suo family guard sneered. "Trying to pin a label on me? It's useless. In short, without our Tu Mammy's orders, no one is allowed to approach!"

"Then I'll just take him by force!" Leopard Head let out a vicious laugh, drew his sword, and charged.

The sounds of cursing and fighting from the slope faintly drifted into the bridal tent on the high ground.

"What's going on?" Suo Chanzhi asked vaguely, lying on her side on the couch with a languid air.

She hadn't slept well last night and had exhausted her energy and strength. When she got up early this morning, she hadn't even eaten breakfast before taking a bath. Now she was so tired she could barely keep her eyes open.

She wasn't worried about the noise outside; it couldn't be another bandit attack, could it? The bandits had already attacked once, and they were now on guard. If more bandits came, they couldn't possibly break into the center of the camp as easily as last time.

"I don't know, I'll go take a look," Little Green Plum replied.

After her bath, Suo Chanzhi had changed into a thin, soft nightgown and was lying on her side on the couch, with only a thin quilt draped over her waist.

Little Green Plum looked at her languid, irresistible appearance, her curiosity piqued. Just as she was about to ask something else, she suddenly heard a clamor of shouting and cursing from outside.

Having received her orders, Green Plum could only agree and hurriedly ran out.

Suo Chanzhi, on the other hand, lazily grunted and let out a yawn.

She was really so sleepy right now. She wanted to take advantage of the time before they set off to get a good nap.

On the slope, seeing Leopard Head's ferocity like that of a leopard or a tiger, the Suo family guard showed no fear.

He ran straight towards Leopard Head. As he ran, he flicked his thumb, and the sharp blade in its sheath "clanged" as it sprang out.

With a flick of the guard's thumb, the blade left its sheath and shot into the air.

The guard surged forward, his right hand reaching out to catch the blade bouncing in the air.

"Whoosh~," with a sharp whistling of the blade, it transformed into a disc of light and slashed down towards Leopard Head's head.

This series of movements was as smooth as flowing clouds and water, very impressive to watch.

However, impressive as it was, it was clearly not as practical as Leopard Head's movements.

With a deafening "clang!" that made one's teeth ache.

Leopard Head had already met the attack with his sword sideways. The guard's fierce slash came down, and his sword broke in two with a "clang," the broken half of the blade whistling as it flew into the air.

Leopard Head sidestepped and charged in. Taking advantage of the guard's shock and hesitation, he executed a "Body Press," sending the guard flying backward.

In mid-air, the guard let out a "wah" and spat a mouthful of blood. The impact had clearly injured his internal organs.

Leopard Head had sent his immediate opponent flying with a Body Press, leaving his own front wide open. Immediately, three more Suo family guards rushed at him.

"Here they come!"

Leopard Head was unafraid. With a vicious laugh, he swung his sword to meet them.

A series of grating impacts made one's teeth ache. The three Suo family guards opposite stumbled back several steps, their虎口 (tiger's mouth) split, their arms trembling. The sharp blades in their hands were all chipped with holes the size of beans.

Although Leopard Head had made a move, he did not dare to kill them. When he met their attacks, he used the back of his夹钢 (steel-clamped) sword. The three sharp blades chopping down on the back of his sword naturally couldn't get the better of him.

Leopard Head strode forward, his sword flying up and down, sometimes like a copper whip sweeping fiercely, sometimes turning into an iron ruler striking hard.

Although he didn't dare to kill, he aimed for the opponents' weak spots. Each strike bit into the flesh without taking a life. In the blink of an eye, seven or eight men were rolling on the ground, wailing in pain.

As Leopard Head made his move, his subordinates also drew their weapons and engaged the Suo family guards.

As the two sides clashed, the Suo family guards who were still watching nearby immediately rushed over, shouting curses.

Their movement was seen by the Yu family guards who were still watching from below, so they too rushed over with loud shouts.

But before they could reach Leopard Head's side, they were intercepted by the Suo family guards who had come to reinforce. In an instant, it was a scene of flashing blades and shadows, with cries of battle everywhere.

After the groom's death, the conflict between the two in-laws had finally been brought into the open.
