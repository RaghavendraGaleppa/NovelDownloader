# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 100: Deceiving Heaven to Cross the Sea  

After leaving the marketplace, Lin Xian's expression turned solemn. He immediately retrieved the Snow Jade Ring and soared into the distance on a beam of light. Shortly after his departure, the previously calm air rippled as a dark mist materialized.  

Two Foundation Establishment-stage demonic cultivators emerged from the mist.  

"To think we're being sent to track a mere Qi Refining-stage cultivator?"  

"Don't underestimate that kid. Though his cultivation is low, he just sold over a thousand spirit-nourishing pills. Someone like that is no ordinary rogue cultivator. The master has ordered—"  

Their voices gradually faded as they transformed into a streak of black light, vanishing in the direction Lin Xian had fled.  

Unbeknownst to them, another group of cultivators emerged shortly after. Clad in pristine white robes with lifelike sea dragon patterns embroidered at the hems, they watched the departing figures with cold expressions.  

"Hmph, those scum from the Extreme Demon Cave dare to stir trouble in our Sea Dragon Sect's territory."  

"Senior Brother, there's no need for anger. Though those demonic cultivators are arrogant, they still hold some respect for our sect. That junior brought this upon himself—selling so many pills in half an hour! Even if they were the lowest-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills, a thousand at once is far too extravagant. Not just demonic cultivators—I suspect even many orthodox cultivators would be tempted to rob him. Besides, once he left the marketplace, he was no longer under our protection. The Extreme Demon Cave's actions don't slight our sect's reputation."  

The leader of the Sea Dragon Sect cultivators snorted but showed no intention of pursuing the matter further.

Lin Xian's flight was astonishingly swift, leaving the two trailing demonic cultivators baffled. In terms of speed alone, this kid could rival an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

As the surroundings grew increasingly desolate, the demonic cultivators prepared to strike. Just then, a vast forest appeared ahead, and Lin Xian swiftly vanished into its depths.  

Upon landing, Lin Xian's expression darkened. His spiritual sense far surpassed that of his peers, so he had long detected his pursuers. However, to lull them into complacency, he had feigned ignorance.  

This situation was within his expectations—earning thousands of spirit stones was bound to arouse greed. What he hadn't anticipated was attracting Foundation Establishment experts.  

If it were just one, Lin Xian might have had a chance to escape. But two?  

Fortunately, he had prepared a contingency plan.  

A cold smile curled his lips. Despite the danger, he remained composed.  

About a quarter-hour later, the two demonic cultivators arrived above the forest. Though the dense foliage obscured their vision, they paid it no mind—their spiritual senses could easily pinpoint the boy's location.  

---  

This remote wilderness was the perfect place for murder and plunder.  

"Well? Found him yet?"  

"Strange. I clearly saw him enter, but his presence has vanished. There's only some trash Qi Refining first-layer cultivator inside."  

"A first-layer cultivator?"  

The two demonic cultivators exchanged glances before descending.  

"Kid, did you see a sallow-faced man in his thirties enter here?"  

In a small clearing at the forest's heart, a plain-looking youth of about twenty was diligently practicing Ice Bullet Techniques.  

"Ah! Greetings, esteemed seniors!" The youth stammered, his dull-witted demeanor betraying his awe of the two high-level demonic cultivators. "N-No, I haven't."  

"Esteemed seniors, your cultivation is so profound! Could you... take me as your disciple?"  

"Take you as a disciple?" The taller demonic cultivator sneered, scanning the area once more with his spiritual sense but finding nothing.  

"You truly saw no one else enter?"  

"Y-Yes! How would I dare lie to you? Please, accept me as your disciple!"  

The demonic cultivators had no patience for his babbling. They refused to believe a grown man could simply vanish. Splitting up, they scoured the area for half an hour but found no trace of their target.  

Defeated, they could only leave in frustration.  

As their retreating figures disappeared beyond the horizon, the foolish expression gradually melted from Lin Xian's face, replaced by sharp intelligence.  

Wiping sweat from his brow, he exhaled in relief. The gamble had paid off.  

Once out of sight, Lin Xian first dispelled his Heavenly Demon Disguise Art, reverting to his true appearance. Then, he drank a drop of Crimson Vine Liquid to conceal his cultivation level.  

Though the demonic cultivators had suspected him of being the sallow-faced man in disguise and scanned him multiple times with their spiritual senses, they found no flaws.  

For one, Lin Xian wasn't disguised at all—his true appearance held no traces of deception. Secondly, the Crimson Vine Liquid was extraordinarily potent; even enhanced Spirit Eye Techniques couldn't detect his hidden cultivation.  

Arrogant in their superiority, the demonic cultivators never imagined a Qi Refining cultivator could outwit them. Thus, Lin Xian successfully deceived them.  

Of course, this wasn't without risk. Had the demonic cultivators failed to find their target, they might have vented their anger on him.  

Yet even this possibility had been part of Lin Xian's calculations. Though the immortal path was brutal and bloody, cultivators—whether orthodox or demonic—prized their reputations. As Foundation Establishment experts, bullying a mere Qi Refining novice would be utterly shameful.  

---  

Everything unfolded as Lin Xian had predicted. Though unwilling, the demonic cultivators had no choice but to leave empty-handed.  

The danger had passed, yet Lin Xian felt no joy. Relying on wit and luck to repel enemies was precarious—he despised this sense of vulnerability.  

Had he possessed sufficient strength, none of this would have been necessary. Those who dared scheme against him could simply be crushed outright.  

One's fate must remain firmly in their own hands.  

Standing silently for a long moment, Lin Xian finally took flight, his expression resolute. This incident had been a stark reminder—in the world of cultivation, strength reigned supreme. Only power commanded respect; reason held no sway.  

His top priority now was to enhance his strength and break through to Foundation Establishment as soon as possible.
