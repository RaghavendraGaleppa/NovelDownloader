# Chapter 58: Departure

"You're all staring at me like that, you'll make me blush..."

Returning to the VIP room, Zhou Tian said shyly, looking at the room full of people whose eyes were gleaming with excitement.

"Zhou Tian, you've been hiding your true strength quite well. If not for today's incident, how much longer were you planning to keep it a secret?"

Liu Yan, with her bright eyes shaped like crescent moons and sparkling white teeth, seemed to be in a rather good mood.

Supporting Tian Ling as she sat down on a nearby chair, her complexion had improved significantly thanks to the divine medicine she'd just taken. Zhou Tian chuckled, "When? Perhaps when you and Zhou Zui get married?"

"You... when did your mouth become so sharp-tongued?!"

Liu Yan was choked speechless, only able to say with resentment.

Zhou Zui, standing nearby, looked utterly bewildered. "Meow meow meow?"

"Since this matter is concluded, we won't linger any further. Farewell..."

Li Xunchuan stood up and said, the others echoing him one after another.

Clearly, the young couple had things to discuss. What were they doing here, being a third wheel?

The group stood up and left one after another. At the very end, Liu Yan suddenly turned her head and said, "Little Sister Tian Ling, don't easily believe certain people's sweet words, okay!"

Zhou Tian felt helpless. This Liu Yan truly held a grudge. Tian Ling's delicate body still exuded wisps of spiritual radiance, her skin like crystal, making her look like a fairy stepped out of a painting – this was the lingering effect of the divine medicine.

Hearing Liu Yan's words, Tian Ling's large eyes fluttered, full of spiritual light. Her delicate brows curved slightly as she glanced at Zhou Tian, then nodded at Liu Yan.

"Hehe..." Liu Yan let out a light laugh, her eyes full of cunning, then walked out.

"Ling'er... are you okay physically?"

After they left, Zhou Tian sat beside Tian Ling and asked with concern.

"Almost completely recovered. That divine medicine... it's incredibly potent."

Tian Ling felt the divine elixir within her still continuously releasing its medicinal effects and said softly. This divine medicine was no ordinary item; it had already healed all the injuries she sustained in the arena. The divine radiance it currently emitted was even repairing her physical body inch by inch, slowly mending even some hidden old injuries she had previously accumulated.

"That's good..."

Zhou Tian let out a sigh of relief. That pill was something he had requested from Zhou Xunchuan. He wasn't entirely sure of its exact grade, but anything from Zhou Xunchuan's hands was certainly extraordinary.

The atmosphere grew silent. Zhou Tian looked at Tian Ling's peerless face, like a fairy from a painting. At this moment, she was staring into the void before her, lost in thought.

A moment later, Zhou Tian let out a wry smile.

"Ling'er, I'm sorry..."

It was clear from his actions in the arena that Zhou Tian had been prepared all along; he just hadn't told Tian Ling.

"It's fine..."

Tian Ling turned her head towards Zhou Tian, her autumn-water eyes gazing at him. A blush crept onto her pretty face, and her eyes seemed to be veiled by a layer of mist as she said softly, "What can I do? I like you, after all."

Zhou Tian looked into Tian Ling's crystal-clear eyes, clearly seeing his own reflection in her pupils. He felt his face grow hot. Impossible... How could I be blushing...? I'm the "Nightclub Prince"... It must be shock, I'm just too shocked... Why does Tian Ling feel a bit different? The old her would never have said something like that...

What Zhou Tian didn't know was that after Tian Ling's perceived "certain death" situation in the arena just now, her psychology had undergone a slight change.

Zhou Tian felt his body float a little, as if he were about to fly...

A smile slowly blossomed on Tian Ling's pretty face. Her brows, like distant mountains veiled in mist, curved slightly, and her eyes, like crescent moons, were as stunning as plum blossoms blooming in winter.

"Zhou Tian, are you... blushing?"

Zhou Tian was silent for a moment, then said in feigned anger, "Oh, you dare to tease your husband? What crime does that warrant?!"

"Mm... Ngh..."

Tian Ling let out a soft cry. Before she could finish her sentence, her mouth was sealed, and her whole body went limp...

.........

In the following days, Zhou Tian felt that an extremely boring life was about to begin, because he had received very bad news:

Tian Ling was returning to the Haotian Sect!

Upon receiving this news, Zhou Tian was like a salted fish whose bones had been removed, too listless to even turn over.

Qin King's Manor Main Hall

"Young Master Zhou, please don't look at me like that. I truly didn't tell Senior Sister to go back!"

Zi Xu looked at the gloomy-faced Zhou Tian, but it was primarily Zhou Shu, standing beside him, that made him tremble with fear. Through that day's projection, he now realized that his supposedly well-hidden "old master" was as obvious as a giant lightbulb in the eyes of these people. He gave a wry smile and said.

"I know!"

Zhou Tian said. Of course, he knew it wasn't this kid; this kid didn't have that much power. It was mainly a letter from the Haotian Sect's Sect Master. After Tian Ling read it, she expressed her desire to return for a visit.

Driven by curiosity, Zhou Tian had Uncle Zhou make a copy for him. There were no secrets in it; it merely explained the situation: Tian Ling was the Haotian Sect's representative for the Eight Provinces Grand Competition, so the Sect Master wanted her to return for training.

Although there were countless experts in the imperial capital, any random one would be stronger than the Haotian Sect Master, Tian Ling had grown up in the Haotian Sect since childhood and considered it her home. After being away for so long, she still wanted to go back and see it, even though this "home" had already disappointed her once.

But Zhou Tian was displeased. He always needed someone to vent his frustration on, and this Zi Xu kid became the perfect target.

"Kid, let me tell you, don't harbor any improper thoughts. Otherwise, you won't be the only one to suffer!"

Zhou Tian put his arm around Zi Xu's shoulder and whispered into his ear.

"Young Master is jesting. How could I possibly harbor any improper thoughts!"

Zi Xu forced a wry smile, revealing nothing.

"I'm ready..."

Tian Ling's voice came from outside. Dressed in white, Tian Ling entered, gracefully slender and elegant, as if she had stepped out of a painting. A fragrant breeze wafted forth, and behind her followed the nameless middle-aged man.

By now, Zhou Tian no longer tried to stop her. Although Tian Ling appeared to be a delicate and fragile girl, she actually possessed a strong will. Through the previous incident, she had understood that if she remained a pampered Young Master's consort in the imperial capital, she basically wouldn't be able to die even if she wanted to.

But she didn't want to constantly shelter under Zhou Tian's wings, which was why she wanted to go back.

Zhou Tian also knew he couldn't stop Tian Ling. He sighed.

"Let's go... Let's go, come with me to the teleportation array..."

Within the Qin King's Manor, there were teleportation arrays leading to various places across Futian Province. When Zi Xu and the others arrived, they had to make several transfers because of the great distance; few cities had direct teleportation arrays to the imperial capital.

However, the Qin King's Manor lacked nothing; it had a direct teleportation array to the city nearest the Haotian Sect, saving a lot of time.

Tian Ling also didn't refuse. Not taking a shortcut when available, and insisting on taking a detour, wasn't called self-reliance; it was called being an idiot!

As Zhou Tian watched them, Tian Ling and the others stepped onto the teleportation array. He had rather hoped for a passionate farewell kiss, but unfortunately, Tian Ling was still too thin-skinned...
