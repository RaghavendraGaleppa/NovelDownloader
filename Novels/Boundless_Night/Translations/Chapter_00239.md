# Chapter 239: An Unprecedented Luxurious Experience

It turned out to be the work of a Millennium Family; the Cui family wielded immense power. They possessed profound heritage, maintaining their existence for over a thousand years, and were even growing stronger, truly deserving the title of an evergreen family. Even successive dynasties experienced changes and couldn't compare to them. Many of their clan members had been sent to various factions in the Outside World and the Esoteric Sects, and quite a few had become grand masters.

Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan frowned, but their expressions quickly turned murderous.

"Don't rush, first record it with a memory crystal; we need a righteous justification!" Yu Gensheng said.

Zhao Ziyuan nodded and said, "Mm, others are fighting against demons, but the Cui family is dealing with their own people. It's truly disgraceful."

Both were skin and bones, with only sparse hair fluttering on their heads, truly too aged, yet their cultivation grew increasingly profound. They moved like ghosts or spirits, appearing and disappearing without a trace, traversing through waist-high mugwort, sometimes drifting, sometimes swift.

The Cui family members arrived; this small group consisted entirely of masters.

Qin Ming suddenly halted, sensing a thick malicious intent; a group of people was approaching at an exaggerated speed. Moreover, they had already spread out, circling to surround him. Qin Ming frowned; the tree desired tranquility, but the wind would not cease. He guessed it was still the Cui family. At this stage, he lacked sufficient strength and did not wish to clash with them prematurely, but things had progressed to a point where avoidance was impossible.

This area was primarily a vast meadow, with sparse, tall trees reaching into the night sky, and a few old crows cawed in the distance.

"Qin Ming!" a sharp shout came.

Across from him appeared a burly, bearded man, over 2.3 meters tall, his voice reverberating like thunder under the night sky. In his hand, he gripped a pristine white bone spear, exuding heavy murderous intent.

"Cui Sixteen!" Qin Ming recognized him.

This person was of the older generation, extraordinarily talented, and a master on the path of the Esoteric Sect.

The giant man with a full beard said coldly, "No matter what, my Cui family raised you. Is this the attitude you show when you see me? You even address me directly by my rank."

Qin Ming said, "I once faced death for your Cui family, attracting numerous masters from the Li family to chase and kill me. I owe nothing to someone like you, with whom I've barely exchanged a few words normally." Then, he added, "Furthermore, you've come to kill me, and you still expect me to give you what kind of attitude? Get lost!"

The bearded giant Cui Sixteen's eyes were like brass bells, and the bone spear in his hand crackled with electric light, tearing through the thick night. He did not immediately act because he "knew" there were masters nearby. He was probing, waiting for the person protecting Qin Ming to appear; that was the true target of their hunt. The other Cui family members were poised for battle, ready to launch a fierce attack at any moment to support Cui Sixteen and slay the hidden powerhouse.

"Friend, come out!"

Several Cui family masters stood in the grass, holding their breath, carefully probing all directions with their spiritual senses and divine perception, but found no dangerous opponents.

Qin Ming instantly understood that this group thought he had a "Dao Protector" and did not believe he was the one who had killed those three teams. He sighed inwardly, the Cui family was overthinking it; he was no immortal seed, divine seed, or scion of a noble family—there was no one behind him at all.

At this moment, he naturally decided to make good use of the situation and immediately spoke, "What are you shouting about? That elder senior is too lazy to bother with you. Now is the time to kill demons, the old man doesn't want internal strife. Why don't you all retreat!"

Cui Sixteen had just been rebuked, and now seeing him grow even more arrogant, daring to scold them, his face instantly turned so cold it was almost frosted over. The others also darkened their faces. Who exactly was the Millennium Family here? This brat couldn't distinguish primary from secondary, actually daring to turn around and scold them!

"You truly have the guts of a bear and a leopard, seeking death!" Cui Sixteen's voice was extremely cold, and he advanced step by step. He didn't believe that person wouldn't show up. Since the other party was so composed, he would first deal with the young man in front of him to force that person out. The other Cui family members were not far from him, ready to jointly attack their opponent at any moment, while still scanning the vast grassland.

"You're the ones who want to die! Are you trying to offend the elder senior's prestige? Hurry up and get lost!" Qin Ming spoke his mind directly; since confrontation was inevitable, there was no need for pleasantries.

The Cui family members felt like flaying him alive; with some of their direct descendants dead, their hearts were already filled with boundless anger and resentment, yet he was still jumping around.

Cui Changming, Cui Cheng, and others; the spirit beasts they sent out found nothing, believing there were no other masters nearby.

"Could it be that he possesses a rare treasure?" Several people guessed this possibility. Did he use it to kill Cui Changkong, Cui Qing, and others? They then remembered that several spirit beasts had been following from afar and had indeed never seen any other figures. Could they have been mistaken from the very beginning?

One of them spoke: "Qin Ming, my Cui family provided you with food and clothing and raised you, yet you, this ungrateful wretch, ended up harming our clan members. Do you have any conscience left?"

Qin Ming said, "Don't you feel disgusted saying such things? It's excessively hypocritical."

Cui Sixteen bellowed, "You house-born slave, who gave you the guts to speak to us like this?"

At this moment, Qin Ming was enraged; the other party had even used the term "house-born slave," which was truly malicious.

"With people like you in the Cui family, there will inevitably be a risk of ruin!" he said indifferently.

Cui Changming spoke: "Sixteen, why bother getting angry with a child? It only makes you appear petty and lacking in grace. What if he curses a few times?" He looked at Qin Ming and said, "Child, I know you harbor resentment, but you can't blame us. A person's words, actions, and choices depend on their position. Some decisions are not up to individuals; it's the events themselves pushing things forward."

"What do you want?" Qin Ming asked calmly.

Cui Changming said, "You've mastered the Silk Scroll Technique, haven't you? Come back to the Cui family with me. Even if you've committed multiple bloody acts, I can guarantee your safety."

Qin Ming said, "What if I don't go?"

He knew that the Cui family was extremely concerned about the Silk Scroll; even their elder ancestor was studying it. Clearly, the Cui family saw hope in him, wanting to use him to further analyze the Silk Scroll and allow those in their clan taking the path of rejuvenation to master it. As for the hidden danger in the scripture, where the body would eventually explode, that would only happen after cultivating to a certain level, and many people wouldn't even reach that height. These Cui family members saw Qin Ming's value; even if they couldn't decipher anything, they could use him as a "mother seed" to guide others onto the path.

Cui Changming smiled faintly and said, "You're also a child who grew up in the Cui family. Do some things really need to be said so bluntly?"

"There's no way I'm going with you!" Qin Ming flatly refused. If he truly went to the Cui family, living might be more painful than dying.

Cui Cheng said, "Flowing dynasties, ironclad aristocratic families. The Cui family has watched the major forces in the Night Mist World change throughout history, while we have always been here, never leaving."

A Millennium Family, being a behemoth, indeed suppressed many, making them unable to breathe. Just mentioning them would make all parties incredibly wary.

Qin Ming drew his blade, its gleaming surface reflecting his handsome face and resolute expression.

"Sixteen, take him away," Cui Changming ordered.

It was clear that Cui Sixteen was not suited for intelligence gathering; he was merely a blade in the hands of this small group, and now it was time for him to "work."

"You little ungrateful wretch, come here!" The bearded giant sneered, holding the pristine white bone spear in one hand, while his other large, fan-like hand reached out, grabbing towards Qin Ming.

Qin Ming's expression was indifferent; he no longer cared, even if it meant exposing the ragged cloth or the Essence of Starlight. Cui Sixteen was burly, but his body was exceptionally agile and nimble, like a night bird soaring across the grassland; dozens of meters felt as close as arm's length to him. He seemed to be teleporting, his speed horrifyingly fast.

However, the sneer on his face suddenly froze, and his body stiffened mid-motion. Everyone was shocked, for they clearly saw his head abruptly shatter, bone fragments, blood, and pulpy matter scattering in all directions. Such a bloody and horrifying scene shocked everyone; a master of the early Third Realm had actually died so miserably. Cui Sixteen's "head opened wide," it was truly too sudden.

An iron pellet, jet-black and faintly gleaming with celestial light, shot out from Cui Sixteen's shattered skull. It was this object that instantly killed a direct descendant of the Cui family. Only then did the terrifying sonic boom erupt, deafeningly loud. Furthermore, it could be seen that along the path where the iron pellet flew, the residual shockwaves it generated completely disintegrated the waist-high grass and other ground cover.

The fierce Cui Sixteen's headless corpse remained stiff for two breaths, then fell with a thud. The Cui family members' hair stood on end; there truly was someone behind Qin Ming! Although Cui Sixteen was reckless, his talent was indeed very high; he was a very useful butcher's blade, yet he died violently in the blink of an eye. He died too quickly, causing everyone else's hearts to sink.

Qin Ming was a bit dumbfounded. Constantly struggling against the current, when had he ever received such treatment? Had the sun risen from the ground again today? He felt it was somewhat unreal. He knew his own situation perfectly; he was very clear that there was no Dao Protector beside him.

On the grassland, within the night mist, a black shadow like a phantom appeared, abruptly pouncing towards Qin Ming. Not all of the Cui family masters had revealed themselves earlier; someone had been secretly approaching, now exposed, intending to control the main target and thereby threaten the "Dao Protector."

However, even though he was incredibly swift, he failed to succeed. The grassland trembled, as if a colossal beast was galloping, and the grass along its path all exploded. A withered, gaunt grey figure flashed past, like a hurricane sweeping through, making it impossible for one to open their eyes.

The person from the Cui family who had sneaked in, intending to ambush and abduct Qin Ming, was horrified to discover half of his body was gone. He screamed miserably but couldn't produce the sound he intended. Because his entire left side, including a part of his throat, had vanished along with it. That grey figure was ridiculously fast, like a thunderstorm, yet also like a hurricane. As it passed, it merely swept him with its large sleeve, taking half of his body with it. At this moment, his remaining half-body was bloody, and it was clear he wouldn't survive.

This scene was truly too horrifying! A chill rose in the hearts of all the Cui family members.

Qin Ming, meanwhile, was in a daze. In a moment of crisis, there was actually "help"? This was an unprecedented "luxurious" experience!
