# Chapter 5: Martial Arts

Zhou Qing assigned learning tasks to each student based on their progress with the Thousand Character Classic and informed them they would be tested again the following day. Those who failed to meet expectations would face the ruler—not because he enjoyed corporal punishment, but because it was the norm of the times. Straying from this practice would only invite unnecessary gossip. Moreover, a certain degree of punishment could motivate the students. At their age, most struggled to understand the significance of education for their future.

The Thousand Character Classic was structured in a progressive, coherent manner, with ornate yet natural phrasing, rich in classical allusions. Zhou Qing proceeded to explain the text. While some references differed from what he had learned in his modern life, his inherited memories allowed him to teach with confidence and clarity. By the end of the lesson, while the results weren’t outstanding, it could at least be described as engaging.

Still, some students remained inattentive, even dozing off. Initially, Zhou Qing could only offer gentle reminders. His youthful appearance made it hard to command authority, no matter how stern he tried to appear. Eventually, he found a solution—channeling the essence of the Tiger Play from the Five Animal Exercises. The effect was surprisingly effective.

"No wonder there’s a saying about the awe-inspiring presence of a tiger," Zhou Qing mused, observing the students' reactions. Tigers were the kings of beasts, and as his mastery of the Tiger Play deepened, his simulated tiger-like aura might one day evoke a truly regal bearing.

The morning consisted of two classes. During the second, Zhou Qing let the students study independently while he practiced calligraphy on rough paper provided by the village school. Though crude and far inferior to hemp paper, the fact that the school even had such supplies was a rarity in most villages. As the teacher, Zhou Qing had free access to these materials. Grinding ink, he began writing, using the exercise to refine both his brushwork and his Tiger Play techniques—since the latter involved hand movements that could be honed through calligraphy.

Writing also helped calm his mind. Teaching could be frustrating, after all. He focused on the characters for "tranquility" (心静), a common choice among calligraphers seeking inner peace. Soon, he became immersed, his mind settling into serenity.

After the morning lessons, lunch was served in the school’s dining area. The students ate coarse rice with scant vegetables and little oil, while Zhou Qing, as the teacher, enjoyed white rice mixed with lard and greens, drizzled with soy sauce and topped with a thin slice of cured meat. This fare surpassed what most private tutors in Jiangzhou City received.

Jiangzhou was flanked by water on two sides, with mountains to one side and plains to the other. Though Hu Village was on the outskirts, it nestled against the Western Hills, which provided abundant resources. The villagers often ventured into the mountains together, returning with ample harvests, making their lives noticeably better than those in neighboring villages at the foot of the hills. Another reason for Hu Village’s relative prosperity was its single-surname cohesion, which gave them more leverage against oppressive taxes and conscription. Even if a village produced a scholar, their influence typically benefited only their own family.

Neither Hu Village nor its neighbors had ever produced a Provincial Graduate (举人). Scholars (秀才) were gentry, but Provincial Graduates were officials. While scholars could still be poor, Provincial Graduates never were—so much so that there was a saying: "A Provincial Graduate is worth gold, an Imperial Graduate (进士) silver." Another adage held that passing the provincial exams was far harder than the imperial ones. Out of ten thousand scholars, only a few dozen might become Provincial Graduates in a given cycle, whereas hundreds of Provincial Graduates could advance to become Imperial Graduates. 

There were exceptions, of course, like Fan Jin from *The Scholars*, who spent decades failing the county exams before swiftly passing the provincial ones after finally becoming a scholar. Had Zhou Qing not discovered the *Health Preservation Scripture*, he might have devoted himself entirely to passing the provincial exams to change his fate. Now, however, his heart yearned for something else—longevity, the supernatural, and the mysteries beyond the mundane.

After lunch and a short rest, the martial arts instructor arrived. His name was Hu Mo, a lame man who, in addition to teaching at the village school, ran a blacksmith shop. The students, far more enthusiastic about weapons than books, eagerly played with wooden swords and sticks. These were just warm-ups before Hu Mo taught them their real lesson: Black Tiger Fist.

Though primarily a health exercise, Black Tiger Fist had one lethal technique—"Black Tiger Plucks the Heart." Zhou Qing observed intently, memorizing every movement and even Hu Mo’s breathing rhythm. However, the nuances of power generation were impossible to discern just by watching.

"Little Master Zhou, interested in martial arts?" Hu Mo asked. Despite his limp, his presence was imposing, though he treated Zhou Qing with respect.

Zhou Qing bowed slightly. "My health isn’t the best. I was hoping to learn your Black Tiger Fist to strengthen my body."

Hu Mo smiled. "If you wish to learn, I’ll teach you. I just demonstrated the form—why not try it yourself?"

Zhou Qing performed the sequence, deliberately making minor errors to avoid seeming too proficient. Even so, Hu Mo was impressed. By the third attempt, Zhou Qing had nearly perfected the form, astonishing Hu Mo. "You have talent, Little Master Zhou. Though I hear you’ve already taken the county exams. Martial training isn’t cheap—if not for that, you might consider apprenticing at a martial school in Changzhou to learn true skills."

Changzhou was the capital of Tiannan Circuit, which governed three prefectures and seven counties. The Provincial Exams were held there every three years, overseen by the Circuit Intendant. In this dynasty, scholars far outranked martial artists—a reaction to the previous era’s warlord chaos. Even a scholar could stand before a third-rank official without kneeling.

Hu Mo then explained the power-generation techniques of Black Tiger Fist. To Zhou Qing, these seemed less systematic than the Tiger Play, but without Hu Mo’s guidance, he’d never have grasped them. Crossing disciplines was like crossing mountains. Their exchange gave Zhou Qing a clearer understanding of martial arts, aiding his Tiger Play practice.

In return, Hu Mo asked Zhou Qing about obscure characters, many related to traditional medicine. After receiving clear explanations, Hu Mo sighed. "No wonder the village elders say you’ll surely pass the exams this time. The old teacher’s explanations used to confuse me, but yours make sense." He touched his lame leg and sighed again before leaving for his smithy.

The afternoon martial arts class was more like recess, with students free to play after the initial instruction—which explained their enthusiasm. As Hu Mo departed, Zhou Qing overheard him muttering something about "if only I’d known the true meaning of those words, my leg wouldn’t be like this..."

"Did he cripple himself through faulty training?" Zhou Qing wondered. He had assumed Hu Mo’s injury came from military service. The obscure characters Hu Mo had asked about were likely from a martial manual, previously misunderstood due to poor explanations.

"Good thing the Five Animal Exercises I’m practicing are time-tested. At least I won’t cripple myself." Recalling the warmth spreading through his limbs after each session, Zhou Qing suspected the exercises held deeper, mystical benefits—though their full effects had yet to manifest.

"But martial training is three parts practice, seven parts nourishment. My current lunch won’t suffice for proper conditioning." With ten days until his next rice ration, Zhou Qing resolved to make do with the wine Hu the Butcher had given him, which he could trade for food.

Planning to gather firewood, Zhou Qing sought a sickle from the village elder. Before he could set out, Hu the Butcher arrived with a cloth bag. Learning of Zhou Qing’s needs, Hu offered him a bundle of firewood and invited him back to his shop, where he gifted Zhou Qing a jar of lard. The village elders, pleased with Zhou Qing’s teaching, had also authorized an advance on his rice ration, delivered by Hu.

On the way home, Hu explained that even if Zhou Qing failed the exams, the village would retain him as long as he taught well. Hu Village valued literacy—even basic skills could secure jobs as accountants, far better than farming. With taxes growing heavier each year, the villagers needed alternatives. If Zhou Qing could train even a few students for such roles, the investment would be worthwhile.

Back home, neighbors noticed Zhou Qing’s provisions and asked questions, which he answered politely. Behind closed doors, he exhaled in relief. In such a tight-knit community, any odd behavior spread quickly, and malicious rumors could be hard to refute. Moreover, practicing martial arts and studying required space and quiet.

"Environment shapes temperament, nourishment builds the body." Ancient wisdom held truth. Despite his ambitions, Zhou Qing had to ground himself in reality. With no further word from Wang Hai about the examiner’s stance, teaching at the village school provided stability. Once he passed the exams, he planned to sell his house for funds, though he felt guilty toward the original owner’s family.

"Forgive me. When I prosper, I’ll restore your graves with honor." Bowing before the ancestral tablet, Zhou Qing then cooked a meal. The lard, though nutritious, couldn’t match the cured meat he’d finished in two days—a extravagance that would scandalize most households. But to Zhou Qing, health came first.

After resting, he resumed the Five Animal Exercises. Hu Mo’s insights into Black Tiger Fist deepened his understanding, especially of the Tiger Play. By his third repetition, the movements flowed effortlessly. Suddenly inspired, he executed "Black Tiger Plucks the Heart," feeling his entire body’s strength coalesce. Checking his *Health Preservation Scripture*, he found a new entry:

**Martial Skill: Black Tiger Plucks the Heart (Beginner).**
