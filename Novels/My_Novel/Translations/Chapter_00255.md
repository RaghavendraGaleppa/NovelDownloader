# Chapter 255: The Dual Pupils Manifest, Shaking Antiquity and Dazzling the Present!

Li Xian’s heart sank. Encountering disciples from the Wujimen and the Jianyu Tower here was far from good news. Seeing that the two were isolated, he crouched in the shadows.

Waiting for the perfect moment, he launched a sudden ambush. The vast and ethereal leg technique swept forth, knocking the two men off their feet. Immediately after, he grabbed sand and mud, flinging it into their mouths.

Qi enveloped the sand and mud, instantly clogging their throats. The two men panicked, coughing uncontrollably, unable to speak, tears streaming down their faces.

Li Xian carried the "Silk Jade Cord" with him. The [Master Hand] trait was fully displayed as he bound and captured the two men efficiently. He dragged them deeper into the shadows.

He lit a torch, revealing his face. The two men recognized Li Xian, trembling with fear, their eyes filled with sorrow. Li Xian said coldly, "I will ask, and you will answer. If you hesitate for even a moment, I will kill you instantly!"

A Wujimen disciple stammered, "G-great hero, p-please ask!"

Li Xian asked, "How did you discover this tomb?" He interrogated them meticulously, his gaze sharp.

The disciple told the truth: the Sword-Seeking Alliance had crumbled as soon as they entered Tiger's Cry Ridge, suffering heavy casualties. By now, they had lost ninety percent of their numbers.

However, Su Qiuwu, Shen Pingping, and the others possessed profound knowledge. After navigating numerous dangers, they stumbled upon the Resting Forest. They deduced that a tomb might be nearby.

But searching for a tomb in the vast forest was like looking for a needle in a haystack. So, they gathered everyone, tore off their clothes, and pulled them into threads.

They then tied themselves together to look out for one another, conducting a carpet search from east to west. After more than ten days, they gradually stumbled upon the tomb.

They had lost ninety percent of their men, a devastating blow. Yet, dozens remained, a considerable force. Although they lacked Wen Caishang’s profound knowledge and mastery of geomancy, they relied on sheer manpower and resources to摸索 out the tomb's entrance.

Thus, they all descended into the tomb.

However, they were ravaged by traps, ending up in a wretched state. Su Qiuwu, Zhao Zhiyuan, Li Quan, Qi Beidao, and Shen Pingping all suffered serious injuries.

Li Xian continued his interrogation.

He was surprised to hear that they had already found traces of Wen Caishang. They were currently searching for her everywhere!

Li Xian thought to himself: "I was just about to finish my great task, but this calamity had to arise. Well, the tomb is dark and narrow. Why don't I change my clothes and sneak in close!"

He sized up the two men and thought further: "Su Qiuwu is very familiar with the Jianyu Tower. But he definitely isn't familiar with the Wujimen. Although they have many people, it must be a chaotic mix. It would be perfect for me to slip in unnoticed."

Li Xian said, "My apologies!" He killed the two men, stripped off their clothes, and discarded the bodies in a hidden underground river. He quickly put on the Wujimen clothes, tousled his hair to make it messy, and smeared some blood on his face.

He moved along, listening to the wind and exploring bit by bit. He searched intentionally, guessing that since Su Qiuwu and the others hadn't gone deep into the tomb, they must be in the outer areas.

He headed outward to search. Before long, he indeed saw disciples from the Wujimen, Jianyu Tower, and Taixin Sect. Li Xian went to join them, spinning some lies to fool them.

The tomb was pitch black, and everyone was tense. Seeing a fellow disciple only brought excitement, and no one paid attention to Li Xian's abnormalities.

Li Xian asked, "Why are we just staying here, neither advancing nor retreating?" A Jianyu Tower disciple replied, "The higher-ups ordered that this is a crucial passage. We are to block it here!"

Li Xian, having been taught by Wen Caishang, was already familiar with the tomb's layout. He pondered it carefully and realized that this was indeed a vital passage. It seemed that within the Sword-Seeking Alliance, there was someone extremely skilled in tomb geomancy.

Li Xian's guess was correct.

Shen Pingping from Shiluo Village was extremely skilled in dealing with corpses and tombs. Although Wen Caishang had vast knowledge, she might not necessarily be more proficient than him in the "Corpse Tomb" path.

Li Xian frowned, deep in thought. Suddenly, he heard footsteps from a distance, saying, "Hurry, come quickly! We've found that witch's trail!" It was a Taixin Sect disciple.

He briefly told everyone that they had surrounded Wen Caishang in a certain location and to hurry back for support.

However, the tomb passages were winding and complex. Whenever they reached a critical point, the "Twisting Intestine Path" would scatter their formation.

Thus, while sending messages was easy, providing support was difficult.

Li Xian walked and soon became separated from several others. He didn't panic, considering various possibilities. He knew Wen Caishang was extremely skilled in tomb geomancy; using the tomb's traps, she would be very difficult to capture.

Except for a few dangerous areas with no way out. Li Xian thought: "If the Madam is surrounded, it must be in one of those dangerous areas. I'll go check them one by one first."

He turned and rushed towards the dangerous areas.

Soon, he arrived at a dangerous area called the "Four Sages Cave." Four statues stood there, with green faces and fangs, brandishing their claws. During the Nanyang period, the "Four Sages Cave" was a standard feature in tombs, rumored to be able to drive away villains and serve as tomb guardians.

Li Xian hadn't even gotten close when he heard a commotion.

Someone cursed, "Where are the people? Didn't we send word to gather quickly! Why aren't they here yet!"

Recognizing the voice, it was Zhao Zhiyuan.

Li Xian understood: "The tomb is complex. Even after entering the passages, they scattered. Within the Sword-Seeking Alliance, either Su Qiuwu or someone else has deep research on tombs. But this 'Zhao Zhiyuan' knows nothing about this path."

"He encountered the Madam and chased her all the way, blocking her here. But he was ultimately wary of the Madam, so he only surrounded her and didn't attack. He shouted for reinforcements... but how could he know that while reinforcements have indeed come, they can't find their way back and have even lost men!"

Li Xian deduced the situation from scant clues, guessing correctly eight or nine out of ten. He walked to the cave's entrance and indeed saw Zhao Zhiyuan holding a sword on guard, waiting at the mouth of the cave.

Wen Caishang had been waiting outside the Twisting Intestine Path, but unexpectedly heard strange footsteps and saw Su Qiuwu and the others searching for her. She lamented her bad luck while cleverly using the Twisting Intestine Path to evade them.

Her mind was in turmoil, and she moved through the Twisting Intestine Path in a sorry state. However, this scattered the Sword-Seeking Alliance, leaving them scattered everywhere. Yet, the enemy had the advantage of numbers; even though they were scattered and wandering aimlessly, there was still a chance of an encounter.

Wen Caishang's trail was exposed. They pursued her from all sides. She used the tomb to maneuver, avoiding them for several days. But she had no Qi, and her luck was against her.

She gradually felt despair, her strength failing. Finally, she encountered Zhao Zhiyuan. Knowing survival was unlikely, and that using the tomb to escape would only delay the inevitable for a moment, she decided to proactively enter the "Four Sages Cave."

She cleverly avoided triggering the cave's traps, waiting for Zhao Zhiyuan to enter so she could use the mechanisms to fight him. Her heart was set, she held her sword behind her back, her long skirt fluttering, appearing extremely calm.

Seeing her so calm, Zhao Zhiyuan panicked. He sent the few disciples he had encountered to call for help, but a long time passed with no sign of them.

Li Xian lowered his voice and called out, "Senior, we are here to assist!"

He walked closer to look. Zhao Zhiyuan was in a wretched state, missing an arm, and breathing heavily. It seemed the Tiger's Cry Ridge and the mysterious mountain range were extremely dangerous and had tormented him terribly.

The most severe time was when he ate a poisonous fruit and was poisoned. He almost died on the spot. Although he survived, his legs were weak and sore.

"You... you're alone?" Zhao Zhiyuan said.

Li Xian replied truthfully, "I... I don't know. I just heard someone spreading the word, so I followed. But as I ran... I was the only one left. Then I heard you shouting, so I came over!"

Zhao Zhiyuan cursed, "Damn it! Damn it! This damn turtle place, it's pissing me off, pissing me off!"

When Li Xian first met him, Zhao Zhiyuan still had the demeanor of a third-grade martial artist, speaking with composure. But now, his true nature was fully revealed.

Li Xian thought: "Demeanor is truly innate. No matter how well one pretends in daily life, it will be revealed at the critical moment. Zhao Zhiyuan's demeanor is far inferior to Wen Caishang's."

He remained silent.

Zhao Zhiyuan said, "You! Go capture that woman!" Li Xian was stunned, "Huh? Me?"

Zhao Zhiyuan said, "Of course, you! She has no Qi and is seriously injured. What is there to fear? If you're so cowardly, the Wujimen probably doesn't want you anyway. I might as well help them clean up their门户 and劈了 you!"

Li Xian said, "O-okay! I'll go right now!" He untied the great sword from his back and entered the Four Sages Cave.

Four statues, dozens of feet high, stood in the四方. The entrance was decorated splendidly, emitting a purple light, specifically to lure greedy people into the cave.

The moment Li Xian entered, he triggered a trap. Spikes shot up from the ground. He tapped his toes continuously, avoiding the danger.

Zhao Zhiyuan nodded, "This小子 from the Wujimen is a bit better than my Huangsha Sect. Strange... why is there still no reinforcement?"

Wen Caishang sneered, "Even without Qi, killing a villain like you is as easy as pie!"

The Four Sages Cave was a dead end. There was nowhere to retreat. Wen Caishang placed herself here, showing her firm resolve; she had given up hope of survival.

But she was extremely unwilling to only trade her life for a mere villain. So she didn't trigger the traps and decided to face him personally. Wen Caishang thought: "It's hard to survive today, but... I wonder... where is Li Lang? If I could talk to him again, hear his annoying words, it would... it would make me a bit happier."

The tomb was cold and damp; they had been separated for many days, and her longing grew.

Li Xian's hair was disheveled. He shouted, "Watch my sword!" He swung a horizontal slash. This strike was actually a peerless "sword technique"!

Li Xian was proficient in both sword and saber techniques, and both were at the pinnacle. Although Zhao Zhiyuan had a rich martial arts foundation, his vision was not broad, so he couldn't see the trick.

Wen Caishang let out a cold snort and attacked with her soft sword. However, in an instant, she sensed something amiss and recognized that this move was the "Steal the Sky and Swap the Sun" from the "Setting Sun and Fading Blood Sword."

Wen Caishang thought: "Ah! It's Li Lang!" Her heart softened instantly. She knew she was about to die, but seeing Li Xian was already a great satisfaction.

Li Xian had already calculated. His saber momentum became even fiercer. The moment their blades touched, they communicated spiritually. Li Xian turned his blade and changed to a vertical劈.

Both were extremely intelligent and immediately understood the intention.

Wen Caishang thought: "Li Lang wants me to show no mercy, injure him as much as possible to lure Zhao Zhiyuan into the cave, then seize the opportunity to join forces and kill him. Only then can we have a path to survival!"

Wen Caishang's wrist trembled, her soft sword slanted, and immediately drew a deep sword wound on Li Xian's chest. She had stabbed Li Xian countless times, but this time she felt great heartache.

Li Xian砍了 several times, but all were cleverly avoided. His skin was cut, and his body was covered in blood. For the final strike, Li Xian used the "Setting Sun and Fading Moon" move.

This move was a "mutually injuring sword technique." It was part of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword's emotional adjustment, knowing that love between men and women is never purely harmonious. Thus, they created this sword technique to let each other feel the pain.

Li Xian felt that this "Setting Sun and Fading Moon" was just a trick for a couple's flirtation. He rarely took it to heart. But at this moment, it was just the right time.

Wen Caishang thrust her sword, piercing Li Xian's chest. Li Xian slapped his palm, hitting Wen Caishang's shoulder. Wen Caishang's pretty face turned pale, her eyes welled up, she withdrew her sword and stepped back. Seeing Li Xian fall into a pool of blood, tenderness, love, panic, sorrow, sweetness... many emotions surged.

She remembered the sword thrust just now, which indeed pierced his chest. Her heart ached faintly, and she didn't even notice the injury on her shoulder.

Her current situation perfectly matched the essence of this sword technique. This "Setting Sun and Fading Moon."

Zhao Zhiyuan saw this scene, seeing that Wen Caishang had actually been hit by this little servant's palm, her skills truly exhausted. He said, "Hahaha, why do we need reinforcements? Witch, I'll take you!"

He stepped lightly on his qinggong and lunged forward to kill.

Wen Caishang was furious at Zhao Zhiyuan, thinking: "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had to hurt Li Lang." Her eyes turned cold.

Zhao Zhiyuan said, "Hmph! Let you taste this move again!" He thrust his sword at Li Xian, intending to use the "Self-Sacrifice for Righteousness" move to test him.

Li Xian suddenly sprang up, his strength no longer hidden, in the instant of life and death.

The Dual Pupils opened completely for the first time to face the enemy.

In an instant, an unparalleled might swept forth. The Dual Pupil Phenomenon had three great powers: might, strength, and insight.

Since Li Xian manifested the Dual Pupil Phenomenon, he had intentionally restrained his might. Now it was fully revealed, like a thunderclap. Zhao Zhiyuan met his gaze, his scalp tingling, so frightened he was at a loss, trembling and crying out in shock:

"Dual..."

"Dual Pupils!"
