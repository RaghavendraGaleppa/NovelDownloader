# Chapter 96: Fierce Battle

Zhou Qing and the others arrived at a narrow valley filled with mysterious, unknown gray mist. Ahead, with the eyesight of the four innate experts, they could clearly see multiple sets of footprints entering the valley.

At the same time, people were still anxiously rushing into the valley, afraid that they would be too late and miss out on the treasure.

Zhou Qing instructed the three old Taoists to drive away those who were still recklessly entering the valley to their deaths, and then set up a bewildering array.

With the activation of true qi, a thick fog quickly spread.

Zhou Qing told Qin De, the secret agent from the Martial Virtue Office, to find a place within the array and stay put.

With the array in place, those outside would naturally be unable to enter and feed the ghost vine.

Zhou Qing and the three old Taoists entered the valley.

Mao Ri spat out flames, burning back some of the ghostly creatures. On the ground, they could see many snake-like trails and a lot of bloodstains.

An inexplicable shadow weighed on Zhang Jingxiu and the others.

"Damn it, all these people dying must have helped that ghost thing grow a lot," Zhang Jingxiu muttered.

Demons and monsters grew by devouring flesh and blood. Who knew how many people it had eaten in this period?

And there were quite a few martial artists among them.

Zhou Qing kept his divine sense within a thirty-zhang radius, not expanding it to its limit, but it was enough to explore a lot.

When they reached the middle of the valley, Zhou Qing said, "I need to use the Fierce Tiger Killing Scripture. I ask that my two senior brothers and Daoist Zhang protect me."

The further they went, the denser the ghost mist became, even slightly suppressing Zhou Qing's divine sense.

Zhou Qing knew it was time to act.

In an instant, Zhou Qing's divine sense condensed, and a tangible tiger-shaped dharma robe appeared on his body, radiating a brilliant light.

The tiger's roar and thunderous sound expanded from his body, causing the surrounding air to resonate, and the thick ghost mist began to thin.

At this moment, dozens of python-like vines attacked from all directions, black but with a bone-like sheen. The ghost vines were covered in sharp thorns.

Fu Song kicked a piece of rubble, which was easily pierced by the thorns of the vine.

However, with the blessing of the tiger dharma robe and the tiger's roar, these vines were noticeably sluggish.

Fu Song's large hands slapped at the approaching ghost vines, true qi and gang energy coating their surface. He used his Eagle Claw skill, quickly dealing with two vines.

Fu Shan and Zhang Jingxiu moved like lightning, clearing all the dozens of vines around Zhou Qing within three zhang.

At this point, the ghost mist had dissipated a lot, and even ordinary people could see the surroundings.

But soon, hundreds of vines continued to emerge.

These vines twisted, and ghostly roars echoed through the valley. Faint shadows appeared in the ghost mist, like the grassland warriors who had died at the hands of the ghost vine.

"Senior brothers, Daoist Zhang, leave these things to you and Mao Ri. I'll deal with the one inside."

Zhou Qing stood up abruptly.

The ghost vine constantly divided into these vines, which were dealt with by Zhang Jingxiu and the others, which was also a drain on itself.

But the real showdown had to be handled by Zhou Qing.

Zhou Qing first consumed three Qi and Blood Pills, and a surge of qi and blood power entered his body. He used his Wind God Kick, creating a gust of wind that repelled the surrounding vines.

The ghostly creatures scattered rapidly.

With a gust of wind, he shot like an arrow into the deepest part of the valley.

The cave was spacious and cold, extending deep underground.

It was very dark here, but with Zhou Qing's divine sense, everything around him was clear. He "saw" the grassland Martial Saint parasitized by the ghost vine.

"You are very powerful."

The grassland Martial Saint spoke, but it was not the voice of one person, but two voices overlapping, as if from hell, gloomy and terrifying.

"What should I call you? Baji or Ghost Vine?"

Baji was the name of the grassland Martial Saint.

"I... I am the best in the world."

Zhou Qing couldn't help but be surprised, and then laughed, "So you're just a madman."

He could see that Baji's mind was somewhat confused and obsessed with being the best in the world, but who spread those maps?

Zhou Qing's divine sense moved, "Come out."

Wind God Kick!

A gust of wind kicked out, and a large number of rocks fell. A figure fell down, wearing strange sacrificial clothing.

"You must be the Dao Court's immortal envoy, Real Person Zhou. I am the Grand Priest of the grasslands, and Baji's most trusted person."

Before he could finish speaking, a small snake flew out of Zhou Qing's sleeve like lightning, biting his neck.

He looked at Zhou Qing in disbelief. This guy was so powerful, why was he so cautious, even resorting to such dishonorable sneak attacks?

He was originally a wise man of the grasslands, arrogant and scheming. Even after the grassland Martial Saint was parasitized by the ghost vine, he was influenced by him and would listen to him. He also knew that this Zhou Qing was originally a scholar, who valued benevolence, righteousness, and morality. Normally, there would definitely be a lecture.

He could take this opportunity to use some tricks.

But?

Before he could implement any ideas, the other party actually used an extremely poisonous snake to sneak attack him.

He felt extremely foolish, even ashamed and indignant, and then a surge of anger and resentment arose. These thoughts all arose in an instant.

Zhou Qing didn't say anything, but raised his hand and pointed at him.

Then, under an extremely condensed qi arrow, a hole appeared in his heart.

"At least it can be used as a good material for refining magical artifacts."

Zhou Qing planned to make the vine staff into an offensive magical artifact, but this matter still needed careful study to see if Yuan Mingyue could research corresponding formations to engrave on the vine staff.

At this time, Fu Shan and the others inspected the inside and outside of the valley, reached the deepest cave just now, and then transmitted a message.

Zhou Qing went over and saw a stone tablet.

"It's actually a demon sealed by Real Person Jingyang himself," Zhou Qing said with slight surprise.

Under the stone tablet, there were also small characters.

"Great Demon Seed Fetus Technique."

After reading this passage, Zhou Qing was shocked.

"It's actually a method of refining wood-attribute demons and integrating them into one's own cultivation."

Refining demons to enhance one's own strength, but there was also the risk of being occupied by the demon's consciousness, at least being influenced by the demon. Unless one's own will was amazing and could ensure one's own clarity, one could take the opportunity to become a demon cultivator and gain the ability of demons to devour flesh and blood to strengthen themselves.

At the same time, these words also mentioned another technique.

"Five Spirits Holy Body True Scripture."

The Great Demon Seed Fetus Technique was just the tip of the iceberg of the Five Spirits Holy Body True Scripture.

"It seems that Baji practiced the Great Demon Seed Fetus Technique," Zhang Jingxiu said after Zhou Qing explained the words on the stone tablet.

Zhou Qing nodded, "Although this technique is a demonic technique, it has its merits. We can study it carefully when we go back."

Although demonic techniques had terrible drawbacks, they also had great benefits.

The principles could be used to verify one's own cultivation.

Gusts of wind kept exploding.

The two fought down the cliff, leaving large pits with every move, making the valley's mountain walls riddled with holes.

The aftermath of the shock.

Zhang Jingxiu and the others were both horrified and excited.

In just half an hour, the two had exchanged blows countless times. Moreover, Baji cooperated with the ghost vine, using all kinds of incredible attack methods, hitting Zhou Qing's vital points from all kinds of unexpected angles.

But Zhou Qing's reaction was too strong.

Relying on his divine sense, which was much higher than Baji's, Zhou Qing could always accurately avoid Baji's attacks on his vital points or use the Indestructible Divine Skill to defend in advance.

It was just that Baji was now completely forgetting himself and erupting with his fighting instinct, deeply combining with the ghost vine, even disregarding his own life.

Even if Zhou Qing hit Baji's vital points many times, he didn't kill him.

Boom!

The two clashed again.

The bodies separated.

Baji didn't move further, his body instinctively panting heavily.

Zhou Qing's eyes seemed to burst out with essence, his eyes shining brightly, "To be able to fight me to this point, I admit that you are the second best in the world..."

"But, it's time to end this."

Zhou Qing said each word slowly, each word a gathering of thunder.

Baji felt a terrifying danger, but when Zhou Qing slapped out with a palm carrying lightning, he couldn't avoid it at all.

It turned out that Zhou Qing had severely injured Baji's joints many times during the close combat just now.

His flexibility had greatly decreased.

Zhou Qing took advantage of the opportunity to breathe, as well as the power of the Qi and Blood Pills he had taken before, using the Five Viscera Thunder Sound to further stimulate his qi and blood, erupting his potential, and directly unleashing Palm Thunder.

This strike was when Zhou Qing's momentum was at its peak, and it was also when Baji's body was sluggish, unavoidable and unstoppable.

When the ghost vine saw the lightning, it instinctively wailed.

Baji was hit by Zhou Qing's Palm Thunder, but he was still unwilling to give up and fought back desperately. Under the stimulation of his qi and blood, the ghost vine withstood the power of the Palm Thunder and stabbed towards Zhou Qing's face like a tentacle.

But Zhou Qing's attacks were continuous, and he could defend against it once, but not a second time.

At the same time, when Baji's sensitivity decreased, Zhou Qing's whole body roared with tigers and dragons, and his arms actually swelled several times under the blessing of his horizontal training, like the arms of a giant. With a slap, the air became viscous.

Then there was a sonic boom.

Under Zhou Qing's reckless bombardment, Baji's chest was directly shattered, and flesh buds kept growing and spreading, repairing his broken body.

But Zhou Qing didn't pursue the victory.

It was because under Baji's desperate counterattack just now, a thorn of the ghost vine pierced into his flesh.

"Looking for death!"

Zhou Qing shouted in a low voice.

The Five Viscera Thunder Sound rang out, and finally converged into a "hey" sound. Palm Thunder actually exploded in Zhou Qing's body. From the inside out, a large amount of lightning burst out from Zhou Qing's body.

Zhou Qing directly killed Baji's body, and the ghost vine let out a sharp scream.

It detached from Baji's body, and at the same time, the ghost vine was charred black and smoking, like a charred black snake.

At this time, a tiger's roar and a rooster's crow were heard.

Mao Ri seized the opportunity, directly grabbing the ghost vine with its sharp claws, preventing it from escaping, and constantly spraying fire on the ghost vine.

Under Mao Ri's fire attack, the ghost vine became increasingly weak.

Zhou Qing sat on the ground panting heavily.

Zhang Jingxiu and the three others rushed over, feeling ashamed. They really didn't help much this time. Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Shan were determined to cultivate with all their strength after returning this time.

It was really too embarrassing.

Zhou Qing took a Qi Condensation Pill to replenish the loss of true qi and qi and blood.

Although this behavior was a bit extravagant, he couldn't care less at the moment.

After a long time, Zhou Qing slowly opened his eyes, his breath somewhat weak.

"How are you?" Fu Shan asked with concern.

Zhou Qing: "Don't worry, senior brother, I'm fine. I just didn't expect this guy to be so difficult to deal with, causing some damage to my internal organs, tendons, and bones, but it's a good thing. I forcibly used Palm Thunder and realized some mysteries. I'm not far from mastering Palm Thunder."

The experience brought by this kind of life-and-death fight was incomparable.

Zhou Qing's divine sense was even more stimulated and improved. The insights between life and death were no different from the Dao insights obtained from stealing heavenly secrets, both taking the Dao from God.

But he also had to face the risk of death.

But how could cultivation be completely risk-free?

Zhou Qing even savored the fight just now, the kind of thrilling excitement, as if it stimulated some kind of awakening of his instinct.

It turned out that he liked this feeling of walking on the edge of life and death.

The meaning of life bloomed from this.

Suppressing this instinct, he stopped thinking about it.

Zhou Qing was very clear that adventure was in human nature, and it was also one of the driving forces for the development and growth of civilization. It was just that this nature would sometimes harm oneself.

What should be done should be decided according to the situation.

He couldn't let his nature dominate his actions.

The ghost vine finally lost its resistance, forming a black vine staff, the thorns on it had disappeared, and the entire ghost vine had a jade-like texture.

Zhou Qing cut it open, took out the blood core, and also found animal skin from Baji's body.

This trip was roughly complete.

"The blood core of the ghost vine is filled with more qi and blood power than the last magic tree. But compared to the blood core, its body seems to be more precious." Zhou Qing touched the vine staff, and a strange feeling arose in his heart.
