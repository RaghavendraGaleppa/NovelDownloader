# Chapter 20: The Discarded Pills Room

"Here, this is your token. Keep it safe."

A low-level cultivator in his forties tossed a waist token into Lin Xuan's hands, his expression indifferent as he glanced dismissively at the seemingly dull-witted young man before him. The position of Discarded Pills Room overseer was the most worthless assignment—utterly devoid of benefits. This youth must have been tricked by Overseer Feng.

Lin Xuan pretended not to notice the contempt in the man's eyes. With his current secret burdens, maintaining a low profile was essential, and playing the fool suited his purposes perfectly.

"Thank you, Senior Brother."

Lin Xuan examined the token in his hand—about half the size of a palm, made of neither metal nor wood. On its front was carved "Discarded Pills Room," while the reverse bore the word "Overseer."

This token represented his new identity. With it, he could bypass the restrictions in the first level of Danxia Mountain, moving freely in and out of the Discarded Pills Room.

Danxia Mountain, as a crucial site for the sect, was divided into three levels.

The second level housed dozens of alchemy chambers connected to underground fire veins. The third level stored various finished pills and medicinal ingredients—both highly important areas protected by layers of restrictions and countless hidden checkpoints, making entry extremely difficult.

The first level contained the Discarded Pills Room, reception areas, and various utility spaces, with fewer restrictions. With this token, Lin Xuan, now a low-level overseer in Danxia Mountain's outer areas, could move freely throughout the first level.

Clutching the token, Lin Xuan felt a surge of joy but maintained his vacant expression as he bid farewell to the low-level cultivator.

Once outside and alone, Lin Xuan's demeanor transformed instantly. The naive newcomer aura vanished, replaced by sharp intelligence. A faint, mocking smile played at his lips.

The position of Discarded Pills Room overseer was finally his. At the cost of just a single spirit stone fragment, he had secured his objective—ensuring a steady supply of pills for his cultivation without arousing the slightest suspicion. A perfect two-fold victory.

After a moment of contemplation, Lin Xuan retrieved a jade slip from his robe and channeled his spiritual sense into it. It contained not cultivation techniques but a map of Danxia Mountain's first level and important notes—which areas were accessible and which were strictly off-limits.

After a quick review, Lin Xuan located the Discarded Pills storage room and strode purposefully toward it.

"To other cultivators, these discarded pills are truly worthless garbage," Lin Xuan mused as he walked. "Every other area has at least some restrictions, but the storage room has none at all." The more neglected it was, the better it suited his plans.

After about fifteen minutes, Lin Xuan arrived at the Discarded Pills storage room—a modest quadrangle compound. The largest building served as the storage facility, while the others housed the overseer and attendant disciples.

Though simple, the area was spacious. Satisfied with his inspection, Lin Xuan stepped into the courtyard.

Inside, a few fifteen- or sixteen-year-old attendant disciples were idly basking in the sun. Clearly unused to visitors, they started at Lin Xuan's appearance. But upon recognizing his sect cultivator robes, they quickly adopted respectful expressions. The eldest among them, likely their leader, hurried over and bowed.

"Immortal Master, how may we assist you?"

"What's your name?"

"This humble one is Zhao Ming," the attendant replied without the slightest hint of displeasure at the non-answer, his tone reverent.

The other attendants held their breaths, allowing Lin Xuan to fully savor the superiority of his status. To ordinary people, cultivators were lofty beings, and the feeling of being above them was undeniably pleasant.

"You're their leader?"

"Yes!" Zhao Ming answered truthfully. "This humble one serves as the acting overseer here."

"Acting overseer?" Lin Xuan was taken aback. Even for menial tasks, overseer positions were always held by cultivators. For an outer disciple to fill the role...

Noticing Lin Xuan's confusion, Zhao Ming explained with a wry smile: "To be frank, Immortal Master, the overseer position here has been vacant for a long time. With no cultivators assigned, this humble one was temporarily put in charge."

"I see." Lin Xuan nodded. To other cultivators, the Discarded Pills Room offered no benefits, making it undesirable.

Understanding this, Lin Xuan declared with authority: "I am the new overseer assigned by the sect. From now on, the Discarded Pills Room is under my management. Here is my token—inspect it."

Zhao Ming, no fool, had likely anticipated this. Showing no surprise, he examined the token and, finding it authentic, led the others in a bow. "Disciples greet Overseer."

"Enough." Lin Xuan waved a hand. "Return to your duties."

Dismissing the others, he kept Zhao Ming behind. "Show me around."

This was now his domain, and Lin Xuan needed to familiarize himself with it. Zhao Ming nodded and respectfully led the way.

*Creak!*

A heavy door swung open, releasing a shower of dust. Lin Xuan stared in astonishment at the haphazard piles of jars and bottles inside. "This... this is the Discarded Pills storage room?"

"Yes, Immortal Master."

"Why does it look like no one has cleaned or organized it in ages? Where's the inventory? How many discarded pills are here?"

"Ah..." Zhao Ming hesitated before cautiously replying, "Immortal Master, this humble one doesn't know the exact number. The inventory... hasn't been updated in a long time."

"How can that be? Aren't you the overseer? How can you not know?"

"Immortal Master, it's like this..." Zhao Ming stole a glance at Lin Xuan's expression, carefully choosing his words. "As you know, discarded pills contain too many impurities. They're useless to cultivators—harmful even. Though not thrown away, they're practically worthless. With such disarray in storage, who would bother keeping records? This isn't due to negligence on my part—it's always been this way. The Floating Cloud Vale has existed for over a thousand years, and every generation's Discarded Pills Room followed this tradition. After all, these pills are garbage. No one would steal them, so why count them?"
