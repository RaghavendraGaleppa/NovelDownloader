# Chapter 63: Tier 2 Plants

Returning to his spirit fields, Gu Mo gradually calmed his emotions. The events of today would likely become just a minor episode in the long journey of his cultivation.

As he resumed his daily routine of farming and cultivation, time seemed to pass more quickly.

"Finally succeeded."

In the black mist space, Gu Mo gazed at the Peashooter in the cultivation pot. After half a year of investing solar essence, he had finally filled the upgrade arrow that would advance the Peashooter to Tier 2.

Without hesitation, Gu Mo clicked the upgrade arrow. A flash of light later, the Peashooter officially ascended from Tier 1 top-grade to Tier 2.

**Name:** Peashooter  
**Grade:** Tier 2 low-grade  
**Effect:** Fires pea seeds to attack enemies.  
**Planting Condition:** Tier 2 spirit field.  

The appearance of the Tier 2 Peashooter wasn't much different from its Tier 1 version. The only noticeable change was the emergence of mysterious patterns on its pod cannon, suggesting that more significant transformations would occur with further upgrades.

Similarly, the planting condition for the Peashooter had changed to a Tier 2 spirit field. However, drawing from his experience with the Tier 2 Sunflower, Gu Mo knew that Tier 1 spirit fields could still support Tier 2 plants—though he wasn't sure how much of the Tier 2 Peashooter's combat power could be utilized in a lower-grade field.

With this in mind, Gu Mo transplanted the Tier 2 Peashooter directly into his spirit field. As he had guessed, the plant took root without issue. However, he quickly learned the limitations imposed by the Tier 1 field: a significant reduction in attack frequency. The Peashooter required the absorption of spiritual energy from the field to condense energy peas, and a lower-grade field slowed this process.

Fortunately, energy peas could be pre-condensed and fired instantly when needed—though the slow recharge meant he would likely only get one shot. But that single shot packed the power of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, capable of instantly killing any Qi Refining cultivator and posing a threat even to Foundation Establishment experts.

With this Tier 2 Peashooter, Gu Mo felt a surge of security. Even with just one shot, it was a genuine deterrent. Still, for added safety, he decided to upgrade his Potato Mine as well. Once he had both a Tier 2 Peashooter and a Tier 2 Potato Mine, he could confidently pause his cultivation to focus on upgrading his Sunflowers.

Digging up a Potato Mine from the field and placing it in the cultivation pot, Gu Mo began feeding it solar essence. To his surprise, the upgrade requirements for the Potato Mine were only a fraction of those needed for the Sunflower and Peashooter.

Gu Mo reasoned that the Potato Mine's lower upgrade cost was likely due to its nature as a single-use consumable. Additionally, the Potato Mine was currently the cheapest plant in his arsenal.

Based on the current requirements, it would only take a month to upgrade the Potato Mine to Tier 2—a trivial amount of time for a cultivator.

**Name:** Potato Mine  
**Grade:** Tier 2 low-grade  
**Effect:** Deals devastating explosive damage to the triggerer.  
**Planting Condition:** None.  

Gu Mo stared at the newly upgraded Tier 2 Potato Mine in astonishment. Unlike its Tier 1 counterpart, which required a Tier 1 spirit field, the Tier 2 version had no planting conditions at all—it could be buried anywhere.

After a moment of confusion, Gu Mo realized the logic: the Tier 1 Potato Mine he had purchased was a seed, requiring a spirit field to grow. But the upgraded version was already fully matured, needing no further spiritual energy absorption. Without that requirement, it could be planted anywhere and still unleash its full power.

As for how powerful a Tier 2 Potato Mine was, Gu Mo didn’t know—and didn’t dare test it, since he only had one. But he could make an educated guess based on the Tier 1 version. If a Tier 1 Potato Mine could instantly kill an early-stage Qi Refining cultivator, then a Tier 2 version might be capable of eliminating an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

If true, this would become Gu Mo’s ultimate trump card, granting him the ability to kill Foundation Establishment cultivators while still in the Qi Refining stage.

The Tier 2 Potato Mine greatly bolstered Gu Mo’s sense of security. Though it had drawbacks—such as being a stationary trap requiring enemies to trigger it, and being a consumable item he could only produce once a month—these paled in comparison to its power. In the cultivation world, methods allowing Qi Refining cultivators to kill Foundation Establishment experts were either priceless treasures or came with severe costs.

Burying the Tier 2 Potato Mine in the field outside his hut, Gu Mo smirked. If that mysterious intruder who had sneaked into his residence multiple times dared to return, they’d get a taste of its explosive might.

If the Potato Mine failed to finish the job, the Tier 2 Peashooter in the field could deliver the coup de grâce. However, Gu Mo kept both plants in a dormant state by default—he didn’t want the Peashooter wasting its limited shots on random spirit insects or rodents. That would be like using a cannon to kill a mosquito, and worse, it might accidentally damage his crops.

"Speaking of which, the Water Spirit Rice is almost ready for harvest."

Having spent the past period upgrading the Peashooter and Potato Mine, Gu Mo realized his Water Spirit Rice had entered its harvest season. He immediately set to work reaping the crop.

After finishing the harvest, his next goal was upgrading his Sunflowers. With the Tier 2 Peashooter and Potato Mine, he now had some means of self-defense. But to truly grow stronger, he needed more Tier 2 Sunflowers. Increasing their numbers would drastically accelerate his cultivation speed and allow him to upgrade more Peashooters and Potato Mines faster.

"330 pounds—not bad, a 10% increase." After harvesting, Gu Mo tallied the yield. Compared to last year, he had gained an extra 30 pounds—a significant improvement for high-grade spirit crops.

Storing the Sunflowers in his black mist space and leaving the Peashooter, Potato Mine, and koi fish to guard his home, Gu Mo activated his defensive formation, hung an "Away" sign, and set off for the Spirit Plant Hall to report his yield.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo!"

As his paper crane wobbled to a landing at the hall, several outer sect disciples eagerly approached. Further back, many inner sect disciples watched with anticipation, though none dared to step forward with the outer sect members present.
