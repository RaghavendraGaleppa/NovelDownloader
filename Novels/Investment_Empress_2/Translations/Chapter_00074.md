# Chapter 74: The Power of Connections and a Spectacular Boo

This match drew the attention of ten thousand eyes.

It was the first time the Head Disciple of the Sect Master had ever stepped onto the stage.

Ying Bing stood alone, sword in hand, cold and distant. She resembled a divine Snow Lotus from Mount Tian, naturally becoming the focal point of all gazes.

Down below, many disciples stared without blinking, completely captivated.

Opinions varied on just how high her talent was, but there was no dispute regarding her peerless beauty.

She had even formed a dedicated fan group within the Sect...

"Go, Bingbing!"

A disciple shouted out.

One shout infected two, and soon three made a tiger; the consensus of many overwhelmed the facts.

Thus...

The disciples of the Qingyuan Sect sent forth a roaring, tsunami-like cheer.

On the high platform.

"Go, Bingbing!"

Shang Wu waved her fists, rising up without a shred of dignity and waving her hands enthusiastically.

Elder Han Crane’s mouth twitched. *What is she doing?*

As an Elder presiding over a Peak, she had no dignity at all. Was this proper conduct?

"Go, Bingbing!"

The voice of Elder Su from Luoxia Peak was exceptionally loud.

Han Crane: "...."

Ying Bing is fighting *your* disciple, you know!

The high platform was quite lively for a moment.

The other major and minor sects went without saying; they held their breath and watched intently. After all, many of them had come up the mountain specifically because of the startling heavenly radiance.

That opportunity from the radiance very likely lay with Ying Bing.

The scene was momentarily chaotic.

Opposite her.

A cold sweat slid down Xie Lan'ai's forehead. It wasn't because the crowd was supporting Ying Bing, but because of Ying Bing herself.

However, she gritted her teeth and spoke up anyway.

"Sister, I would like to add a wager."

"If I win, please yield the Frost Sword to me."

"If I lose..."

"Fine."

Before Xie Lan'ai could finish listing what she was offering as collateral, she heard a voice like jade dropping onto a plate agree to the terms.

She hadn't even finished speaking.

This made a flash of displeasure rise in Xie Lan'ai's heart.

"Since that is the case, please make your move, Sister."

"Still, you go first."

Ying Bing raised her eyes to size her up for the first time.

Xie Lan'ai understood this wasn't modesty.

Her meaning was: if she moved first, Xie Lan'ai wouldn't even have a chance to make a move.

How arrogant.

Li Mo felt his scalp go numb and took a deep breath.

Right. Absolutely right.

This was the vibe.

"Be careful, Sister!"

Xie Lan'ai said no more. She initiated her move, pushing the Serpentine Sword Art to its absolute limit. The unpredictable锋芒 (edge/blade) swept forward, intending to use the abundant internal energy of the Jade Liquid Realm to overwhelm her opponent with the pressure of a higher realm.

Her anger didn't mean she underestimated her opponent.

Since a Mystical Weapon had recognized her as its master, the other's sword cultivation must be above hers.

But she still held a great advantage.

A higher realm.

More rich combat experience...

In that instant, she thought of many things.

She even thought about how to seal off the retreat if Ying Bing dodged, and how to step by step force the opponent into a frantic defense with her own rhythm if Ying Bing counterattacked.

But actually... she was overthinking it.

Like a woven tapestry, the sword light struck her body. The sharp internal energy cut through the air; even someone of the same realm would be gravely injured if grazed by that edge.

But a slender, pale hand passed through the sword net as if it were nothing.

Amidst the unpredictable sword moves, it was as easy as plucking a leaf in a backyard garden.

The Serpentine Sword Art stopped.

Because the soft sword was caught between two slender, pale fingers.

*Clang—*

A finger flicked lightly.

The blade actually snapped back, tearing its master's lapel.

A fraction of an inch more, and it would have pierced her chest.

Xie Lan'ai stood frozen, pupils constricted, breath halted.

She subconsciously looked at the girl an arm's length away, but saw that pair of ice-mirror eyes remained as deep and calm as ever.

The opponent had shown mercy.

Otherwise, that fraction of an inch would not have been left.

The entire arena fell into silence.

...

On the high platform, silence also fell.

Everyone had thought Ying Bing would win.

They just hadn't imagined it would be in such a manner, so effortlessly.

Facing an opponent a whole realm higher, she hadn't even drawn her sword, using only a wisp of internal energy to wrap her fingertips.

"That sword of hers, is it called Frost?" the white-robed youth from Fenyu Lin said, the arrogance on his face having vanished completely.

The middle-aged man in a Confucian robe didn't answer him, merely sighing in感慨 (emotion):

"Whenever the Qingyuan Sect is in decline, a heaven-defying genius always appears..."

---

As for the reactions of the Elders, there is no need to elaborate here.

Student Li Mo had a live commentary going on.

"This woman is terrifying!"

"Sss..."

"What are you doing?"

Watching Li Mo, who was sometimes lowering his voice and sometimes sucking in cold air, acting out his role, Ying Bing frowned slightly.

Li Mo: "I'm playing the role of a qualified shocked bystander."

Ying Bing: "?"

...

They drank tea for a while longer.

Just as Li Mo was preparing to get up and relieve himself, Elder Qian Bufan's voice rang out:

"The next match."

"Lin Jiang of Ruyi Peak versus..."

"Li Mo of Qunyu Peak!"

Good news, it was finally his turn.

Bad news, he was a little urgent right now.

Coincidentally, he ran into an acquaintance in the very first round.

Just as expected.

The moment Elder Qian Bufan finished reading these two names, the gazes of the entire arena turned toward them, many filled with scrutiny.

There had always been much discussion about Li Mo within the Sect.

Some said he was eager to help others, a gentleman with a warm heart.

Some said his strength was insufficient to be mentioned in the same breath as Ying Bing, and calling them the "Two Heroes of Qingyuan" was unwarranted.

Haters said he was a gigolo, the kept boy of Elder Shang Wu...

Of course, such rumors were purely slander spread by jealous haters. Senior disciples of the Qingyuan Sect knew that Elder Shang Wu herself was penniless; where would she get money to keep a boy toy?

In short, opinions varied.

But one thing was certain: everyone wanted to see just how much this "True Disciple Li" was worth.

Under the gaze of the crowd, Li Mo couldn't very well say he needed to go to the latrine first.

So he could only mount the stage and say softly:

"Brother Lin, let's finish this quickly."

"Sure thing."

And so.

Lin Jiang, who had just stepped onto the stage, walked to the edge of the擂台 (dueling platform).

One second after Elder Qian gave the order 'Begin'.

He jumped off the platform.

"I forfeit."

Lin Jiang shouted without the slightest hesitation, afraid that if he was even a moment too slow, Li Mo would make a move.

Disciples: "Huh?"

The Elders: "???"

The other sects attending the ceremony: "???"

What the hell, is there a fix in?!

You two are both at the Qi Blood Realm, and you forfeit without even fighting? Are you treating us audience members like idiots?!

Lin Jiang, how can you face us?!

RNM, refund!

Oh, we didn't pay to get in.

Then it's fine.

But there is definitely a problem here. A big problem!

The rules didn't say you couldn't forfeit, and falling off the platform indeed counts as a loss, but this kind of诡异 (bizarre) situation had never happened before.

With named sects from Ziyang Mansion present, Elder Qian Bufan felt this was a bit shameful, so he ran back to discuss it with the other Elders.

"How do we rule this?"

"Should we make them fight again?"

"Look at Lin Jiang's state, is there any point in fighting again? It's meaningless."

The Elders couldn't reach a conclusion.

Elder Qian Bufan suddenly thought of something and suspected: "Niece Shang Wu, you didn't secretly threaten Lin Jiang to forfeit, did you?"

The Elders looked at her; this was indeed something she was capable of doing.

"Watch your words!"

"Would I need to threaten a mere disciple? How troublesome."

"It would be more convenient to just threaten Elder Qian to make a biased call, wouldn't it?"

Shang Wu was furious.

They could question her character, but questioning her intelligence was very angering.

The Elders: "....."

Why are you acting so righteous?

So.

Elder Qian could only announce helplessly:

"Li Mo wins!"

"Boo......"

A wave of boos came from below.

Li Mo remained silent for a moment, then smiled bitterly: "Brother Lin, fast is fast, but... was this really necessary?"

"I'm not stupid."

Lin Jiang shook his head like a rattle drum.

He remembered very clearly.

During the Sect trial, one punch from Brother Li turned Wang Hu, who had made him feel suffocated, into a废人 (cripple).

The shell of the Thornback Turtle was shattered... He was simply a humanoid disaster beast.

Fighting Brother Li, isn't that just asking for a beating?

By forfeiting now, he could save his strength for the next match.

If he didn't forfeit, he didn't need to worry about his ranking in the Nine Peaks Martial Gathering anymore.

万一李兄没收住手，直接考虑开席吃几个菜吧..... (If Brother Li didn't hold back, we might as well start planning the banquet menu right now...)
