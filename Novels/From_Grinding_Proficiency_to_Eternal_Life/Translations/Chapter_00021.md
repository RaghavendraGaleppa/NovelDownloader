# Chapter 21: Skin Tempering Great Completion

The next day, the two and a half men traveled another sixty li. After setting up camp in the leeward side of a massive mountain range, Xu Yunfan and Fang Mushan went hunting separately.

An hour later, Xu Yunfan carried a large, elderly wolf on his shoulders, while Fang Mushan held a hare in his hand.

Seeing Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan staring at the wolf he was carrying, Xu Yunfan shrugged.

"I don't know either. I just turned a corner and saw this old wolf that had been driven out of the pack. It couldn't run fast, so I shot it with one arrow."

After a long while, Fang Mushan let out a cold snort. "Tomorrow, your luck definitely won't be this good."

Fang Mushan, who considered himself a master hunter, was naturally unconvinced.

The third day, the two returned empty-handed. Fang Mushan felt a slight comfort and his mind was somewhat balanced.

The fourth day, empty-handed.

The fifth day, empty-handed.

Until the sixth day, as they traveled to a mountain valley facing the snow-capped peaks, Xu Yunfan dragged a massive wild yak before Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan.

Looking at Xu Yunfan's high spirits, Fang Mushan, with his empty hands, remained silent.

Seeing Fang Mushan's desolate expression, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but ask with concern, "Brother Fang, what's wrong?"

Fang Mushan shook his head slightly, his expression tinged with melancholy. "It's nothing, just thinking of some unforgettable things."

Li Haomiao, smiling, watched from the side but said nothing.

Xu Yunfan didn't press further. A little showing off was enough; he couldn't overstimulate him. Although Fang Mushan seemed easygoing on the surface, his temper was as stubborn as a mule.

If he stimulated the other party, he might go all out hunting and not return without a catch. Then, this fellow Fang Mushan might hole up in these eight hundred li of desolate wilderness and drag him into living like a wild man, until he caught prey heavier than his.

"This wild yak weighing several hundred catties is enough to make three pieces of clothing to ward off the cold."

That night, after eating the yak meat, Xu Yunfan swung his iron pick. His mind was no longer on the deepening pit in front of him but was tightly fixed on the information prompts continuously popping up in his vision regarding the Copper Body Art.

The Copper Body Art was about to level up, entering the Great Completion realm.

'You had a sudden flash of inspiration and discovered the hardness changes of earth and stone at different times. You chose to mine when the earth and stone had the lowest toughness, increasing your mining speed.'

'Your mind moved, and you swung the iron pick using the hammering technique of the Copper Body Art. You carefully listened to the resonance frequency of the pick in your hand, found the rhythm, and swung the pick. The vibration feedback was more stable, and your Copper Body Art proficiency increased.'

'...'

'Your Copper Body Art proficiency is full, entering Great Completion.'

'Copper Body Art 0/5000 (Great Completion)

Special Effects: Vigorous Qi and Blood, Strength Penetrates the Entire Body, Skin as Tough as Iron, Muscles and Bones Strong, Hard to Injure with Sharp Weapons, Can Resist Boulders, Extraordinary Strength, Proficient in Hammering Techniques.'

As the Copper Body Art Great Completion appeared in his vision, countless warm currents instantly surged into his limbs like runaway wild horses. His body seemed to inflate, his muscles swelling and bulging.

His skin also began to tighten and swell.

His bones crackled, as if undergoing a reshaping.

His muscles rapidly expanded like they were being inflated, each one bulging high, filled with explosive power.

His skin color gradually deepened, as if cast from ancient bronze, emitting a metallic luster.

Even his Qi and Blood surged like turbulent waves, churning ceaselessly within his flesh and blood. With every heartbeat, he could feel a powerful force surging. That powerful, pump-like contraction made his energy seem inexhaustible.

The improvement in his realm brought him earth-shattering changes from the inside out, as if he had been reborn.

In his mind, a stream of memories began to flow through his heart.

In these memories, the days of cultivation that flowed to his heart were as deeply imprinted as brands.

In a daze, Xu Yunfan felt as if, at the break of dawn every day, he was already standing in the training ground, gripping a long-handled, heavy steel hammer with both hands.

With every swing of the heavy hammer, the core muscle groups of his entire body coordinated, unleashing immense power.

His abdominal muscles were as tense as steel, the muscles in his waist twisted rapidly, driving the biceps and triceps of his arms to swing the heavy hammer with all their strength. Each exertion seemed as if it were about to tear the surrounding air apart.

During the breaks in his training, he would soak his body, pushed to its limit, in a tub filled with various rare and mysterious medicinal herbs.

The secret medicines mixed together, emitting a strange smell. The moment they touched his body, it felt like countless small flames were burning on his skin and muscles, and the stinging sensation spread throughout his body in an instant.

Every day, he had to grit his teeth, his veins bulging on his forehead, sweat constantly seeping from his pores, yet he always endured without making a single sound.

While the medicinal effects had not yet faded, dozens of steel rods, wielded by others, would beat down on his entire body like a torrential rain.

The steel rods struck his skin and flesh, making a dull sound. Each blow shook the Qi and Blood within him into turmoil.

Day after day, never showing the slightest slack.

Finally, on a day with wind and rain, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled in the sky. Bolts of lightning, like giant dragons, tore through the dark heavens.

Xu Yunfan swung his heavy hammer as usual, but inadvertently, he suddenly felt the heavy hammer in his hand no longer seemed heavy. He tried to increase his swinging speed, and the heavy hammer became as light as a needle in its dance.

Each swing easily sliced through the air, emitting a sharp whistling sound. His skin, under the flickering lightning above, shimmered with threads of a bronze luster.

"Skin Tempering Great Completion!"

Xu Yunfan's heart was filled with emotion. In these days, he had almost completely given up on his amateur activities. Aside from necessary hunting and traveling, he had spent almost all his time immersed in the cultivation of the Copper Body Art.

Even his mining was about to reach Great Completion.

Hard work yields rewards.

Heaven rewards the diligent!

Xu Yunfan felt his eyes were a bit moist.

In these days, he felt he was about to become a professional miner, and even his mining proficiency was nearing Great Completion.

He lowered his head and looked at his body, covered in bulging muscles. Even the clothes and trousers he was wearing were a few inches shorter. The Great Completion of Skin Tempering had clearly made him a bit taller.

The Copper Body Art was not just a martial art of swinging hammers; it was also a body-refining technique. With his current physique, ordinary mortal-grade blades and swords would find it hard to injure his body, which is why a bronze luster appeared on his skin.

*Clang, clang!*

Qi and Blood churned, extremely active. Seeing the bronze luster on his skin, Xu Yunfan reached out and tapped it with his finger, actually producing a clear, metallic sound.

When he climbed out of the mine pit, Fang Mushan jumped up the moment he saw Xu Yunfan.

"How have you become so burly?!"

Li Haomiao's eyes, which had been closed, suddenly opened, and a sharp light flashed within them.

"Skin Tempering Great Completion."

Although his expression tried to maintain calm, his heart was already in turmoil. How long had it been since Xu Yunfan truly started practicing martial arts?

By his calculations, from the time he started mining until now, it had been a little over a month?

Even if he had a foundation before, such a terrifying promotion speed was not normal.

Fang Mushan came to his senses.

"True Blood?!"
