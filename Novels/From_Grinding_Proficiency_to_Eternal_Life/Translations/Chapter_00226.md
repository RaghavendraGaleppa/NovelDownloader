# Chapter 226: Cultivation

The demon suddenly rose to its feet, its stone-pillar-like fists colliding with a thunderous boom.

An inexplicable sense of oppression erupted from the white ape, causing Xu Yunfan’s breath to hitch. He forcefully reversed the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength, his shoulder blades dislocating with a grating, teeth-grinding sound. He executed the second stance of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer, "Earth Dragon Turning Over," to directly clash with the old ape’s dual-pillar smash descending from above.

"Boom!"

A shockwave overturned the surface rock layers within a thirty-foot radius.

Xu Yunfan’s entire body of muscles and tendons trembled violently. The scales on his armor rattled and continuously opened and closed, using the force-dissipating technique of the Hundred-Forge Steel Body to channel the impact into the ground. Amidst the crumbling of earth and stone, Xu Yunfan used the rebound force to leap thirty feet into the air.

The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength circulated frantically through his flesh and blood. The scorching breath spewed from his dragon-scale armor vaporized his blood into a crimson mist.

As the old ape swung its stone pillars and charged upward, the Raging Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace suddenly flew from Xu Yunfan’s grasp. Xu Yunfan twisted his waist mid-air to gather power, pouring the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength through the three-hundred-plus-pound heavy hammer and striking the demon’s fatal point.

Amidst the crisp sound of the bronze chains on the old ape’s body snapping one by one, the one-zhang-tall demon body collapsed to its knees. A half截 section of a rust-covered bone-piercing nail burst out from the flesh buds of its right eye.

*‘You have successfully killed a demon. Your proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer has increased.’*

*Quite interesting.*

Xu Yunfan re-slung the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer on his back and adjusted the position of the Raging Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace. This divine weapon had a very bad temper; he was contemplating when to pull the weapon's will into his own Sea of Consciousness and then use the "Lin" character mantra to suppress it with his own spirit. Having reached the minor success stage of the "Lin" character mantra, his mental will had already condensed significantly.

"Hm?"

As his knuckles brushed over the broken bronze shackles on the old ape’s neck, Xu Yunfan suddenly smelled a mix of fishy and mutton-like stench in the mountain wind. Only then did he realize why this demon had climbed to the summit specifically.

Thirty steps below the cliff, on a vine-covered rock wall, a gap over a zhang high had split open. A smell of rotting meat and rust was gushing out from the cave. Dark red crystal clusters condensed in the rock crevices were clearly the result of demon saliva eroding the stone over years and months.

He flicked a pebble into the cave with his toe, and the sound of it clanging echoed through the rock walls nine times.

This place was clearly the old ape’s lair.

Beasts possess keen senses far beyond ordinary people. Choosing this place as a nest naturally means it understood the gathering of Primordial Spirit Qi at the summit.

*It seems that wherever the terrain converges and Primordial Spirit gathers, there are extraordinary creatures dwelling there.*

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan looked up at the continuous mountain ranges ahead. Through the integration of his Dragon-Seeking Pulse-Distinguishing technique into his vision, he saw gathering points of Primordial Spirit Qi amidst the mountains.

Xu Yunfan stepped onto the summit again, gazing into the distance.

Using the Dragon-Seeking Pulse-Distinguishing method, within the folds of the visible mountain ranges, seven strands of purple qi coiled around pillars like dragons rushing toward the heavens. Moreover, three places were suffused with rosy clouds churning like blood pools.

Each spiritual node was entwined with demon turbid qi similar to that of the old ape’s cave, either forming poisonous miasmas that blocked the sun or turning into black clouds pressing down on the sky. The furthest grey-green killing aura spanning three peaks even faintly condensed into the appearance of a nine-headed giant python swallowing the mountains.

This so-called small world secret realm was actually entirely occupied by demons.

But what shocked him the most was that the Divine Weapon Ridge actually possessed a secret realm.

要知道, a secret realm was a foundation that only the six top sects, which once possessed true Human Immortal level experts, could hold.

The mountain wind swept up the old ape’s broken white fur, and Xu Yunfan’s stomach suddenly let out a thunderous growl.

A long while later, Xu Yunfan let out a breath and lowered his head to look at the old ape’s corpse not far away.

He was somewhat hungry. He stared at the knotted muscles of the demon, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he could still taste the bitterness of the Ginseng Baby left between his teeth. The spiritual energy transformed from the rich Ginseng Qi and Spirit Marrow eventually could not withstand the call of his blood and flesh instincts.

For the past few days, he had almost sustained his life solely on the Ginseng Qi of the Ginseng Baby. If he didn't eat something soon...

Xu Yunfan stared at the old ape’s corpse for a long mental struggle before finally stepping forward slowly.

After a small half-hour, Xu Yunfan had already erected a bonfire, skewering several racks of meat.

Xu Yunfan’s fingertips condensed Red Serpent Strength as he cut through the demon’s chest and abdomen; amidst the burnt smell, a faint sandalwood scent actually leaked out.

When the seventh rib was removed, his expression showed a hint of surprise. The dark golden liquid flowing in the demon’s bone marrow was clearly a sign of having swallowed the marrow of a terrestrial dragon.

"Crunch!"

When Xu Yunfan bit into the first piece of crispy meat and swallowed it, his eyes brightened slightly. These old ape’s flesh and blood contained extremely pure blood energy nourishment.

Not long after, beneath the stomach’s digestion of the meat, waves of warmth actually spread throughout his four limbs and hundred bones.

For a time, all his pores opened up with a bang. Stimulated on his back, the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength began to flow uncontrollably.

The spiritual vein essence the demon had swallowed over the past thirty years was now washing through his four limbs and hundred bones along his esophagus.

For three consecutive days, Xu Yunfan looked at the bone in his hand, which had been gnawed clean of even a shred of meat, and casually tossed it into the old ape’s lair thirty feet away. The crisp sound of the old ape’s leg bone hitting the rock wall echoed seven times in the cave before fading.

Feeling the satiety in his abdomen, Xu Yunfan let out a light breath.

He could clearly feel the warmth rising in his lower abdomen driving his blood energy, causing his body temperature to continuously rise, eventually steaming the mountain mist three inches in front of him into wisps of vapor.

As his five fingers loosely gripped the air, knotted muscles surfaced with interlocking patterns of gold and red. This was a sign that after the Hundred-Forge Steel Body had swallowed three hundred pounds of demon flesh and blood, and with its proficiency constantly rising, it was about to reach great perfection.

When the morning light pierced the sea of clouds, Xu Yunfan had already assumed the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain stance. The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength flowed between his flesh, blood, muscles, bones, and skin membranes, using the Hundred-Forge Steel Body to slowly temper his body.

His feet sank three inches into the ground to borrow strength from the earth.

The moment the Pure Yang One Qi Technique operated, the pure yang internal energy flowing within him caused the Primordial Spirit at the summit to converge like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, rapidly pouring through his nasal orifices into his flesh, blood, muscles, and bones.

"Hiss..."

Feeling the swelling pain like needle pricks coming from inside his body, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but suck in a breath of cold air.

His spine suddenly arched like a full moon, and the two pairs of plate-like ribs opened and closed, actually producing the sound of mechanical gears engaging.

The Primordial Spirit of heaven and earth poured into his body flowed continuously between his flesh and skin membranes. The undigested demon flesh and blood essence surged from his stomach, twisting together with his pure yang internal energy.

*‘You continuously absorbed a trace of Primordial Spirit of heaven and earth to transform into Pure Yang Internal Energy to replenish yourself. Your proficiency in the Pure Yang One Qi Technique has increased slightly.’*
*‘You continuously tempered the Hundred-Forge Steel Body through the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength. The two complemented each other, and your proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer has increased significantly.’*
*‘...’*

The martial path of this world emphasizes moving from the external to the internal. One first trains the muscles, tendons, bones, and skin. Then, through the convergence of the three, one generates a thread of strength and breaks through the shackles of the human body with flesh and blood, thereby entering the Muscle Refining realm.

When the strength fills the flesh and blood to the point of overflowing, and the thick strength nurtured to cover every inch within the flesh and blood breaks through the flesh and blood barriers and transforms into the blood within the body, forging true Qi and blood, it is called Blood Exchange.
