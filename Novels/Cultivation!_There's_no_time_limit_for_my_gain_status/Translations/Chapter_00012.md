# Chapter 12: Rusty Sword, Unrusting Heart

The massive ship sailed through the waves, yet Jiang Li in the cabin barely felt any rocking or vibration.  

During these days, he had taken a rare break from practicing the Year Tiger Technique and allowed himself a relaxed sleep.  

A day later, the ship gave a slight shudder as it slowly docked. Exclamations of awe rose from the deck. After exchanging a glance with Yan Hong, Jiang Li stepped out of the cabin.  

Before him lay an island veiled in mist, where two towering peaks pierced the sky under the morning glow. In the distance, streaks of sword light and immortal cranes could be seen traversing the clouds—a scene straight out of an immortal's paradise.  

The group of aspiring cultivators gazed at this sight, their eyes alight with excitement.  

Once the gangplank was lowered, they eagerly disembarked and followed a cobblestone path toward the assembly grounds.  

"So, did you manage to gather any useful information?"  

Jiang Li had come to realize that Yan Hong possessed a peculiar enthusiasm and talent for navigating social intricacies. While he had been lazing in bed, Yan Hong had already taken his nineteen subordinates to collect intelligence.  

The time had come to choose a cultivation sect—a decision that would shape their future.  

Unless something unexpected happened, Jiang Li would likely spend a long time within whichever sect he joined. Unlike a mere job, leaving a sect wasn't as simple as handing in a resignation. To secure a promising future, they needed to evaluate their options carefully.  

First and foremost, they had to consider the sect's scale and developmental prospects.  

Second was the sect's treatment of its disciples—what resources and allowances they provided. No matter how prestigious a sect might be, without decent benefits, it wouldn't be worth joining.  

Third was the potential for personal advancement. If a sect was entirely controlled by certain families or factions, ordinary disciples, no matter how talented, would find it difficult to rise through the ranks.  

These were the three most critical factors.  

Other considerations included the sect's overall strength, areas of expertise, geographical location, internal culture, and the attributes of its core cultivation techniques—all of which needed to be taken into account.  

The Ascension Pavilion naturally wouldn't provide this information, as their goal was to recruit as many disciples as possible for their own ranks. They had no incentive to promote their competitors.  

However, there was still a way to gather intelligence. The thousand-plus preparatory disciples who had endured two years of labor were the best sources.  

Though they hadn't been granted cultivation techniques and remained ordinary mortals, their two years of living as laborers in the cultivation world had exposed them to enough knowledge to answer these basic questions.  

Moreover, as part of the "service industry," everyone in the Ascension Pavilion—from the pavilion master down to the lowliest laborer—had to memorize the names of powerful sects and the influential figures within them to avoid offending the wrong people.  

Thanks to Yan Hong's efforts, Jiang Li soon held in his hands a booklet detailing the major sects within the Great Heavy Mountain region.  

"Fifty-two sects are participating in this Ascension Assembly," Yan Hong explained.  

"Among them, four are particularly recommended. They are the strongest and most influential in this region, and they attract the majority of disciples during each assembly."  

"However, some reliable mid-sized and smaller sects often offer better benefits to attract new disciples."  

"In some of these smaller sects, with our aptitudes, we might directly enter the inner sect or even become personal disciples receiving full support."  

"Take a look and help me decide."  

Yan Hong flipped through an identical booklet, his face twisted in indecision—like a top-scoring scholar agonizing over whether to attend Tsinghua or Peking University.  

Jiang Li sighed inwardly. With Yan Hong's high-grade spiritual root, no sect would likely turn him away.  

"First, we absolutely cannot choose any fly-by-night sects. If they have incomplete legacies or broken cultivation techniques, we'd have nowhere to cry about it."  

He flipped through the pages and noticed that the first sect listed had numerous annotations.  

"This Shu Mountain Five Elements Peak seems impressive. They have relatively few disciples, yet they're the strongest among the four, inheriting a branch of the ancient Shu Mountain Sword Sect."  

"Every disciple who joins even receives a lifebound flying sword from the sect—far better treatment than the others."  

Jiang Li pointed at the first name on the list.  

"That's true," Yan Hong agreed. "Shu Mountain Five Elements Peak is undoubtedly the righteous leader of the Great Heavy Mountain region. But their recruitment criteria are unusual."  

"Not only must disciples possess at least a mid-grade spiritual root, but they also require a special talent called 'Sword Heart.' Even a supreme-grade spiritual root won't get you in without it."  

Jiang Li sucked in a breath. "They reject supreme-grade spiritual roots? What exactly is this Sword Heart talent?"  

By conventional wisdom, a supreme-grade spiritual root cultivated three times faster than a high-grade and nine times faster than a mid-grade. That Shu Mountain Five Elements Peak would turn away supreme-grade talents was bafflingly strict.  

"Fine, we can still go test for this Sword Heart thing. But we should also think about alternatives in case we fail."  

Excluding Shu Mountain Five Elements Peak, the other three top choices were Mercy Shore Temple, Hundred Refinements Mountain, and Scripture Valley.  

Mercy Shore Temple, as the name suggested, was a Buddhist sect specializing in body tempering and indestructible golden bodies. Like Five Elements Peak, they focused on combat, wielding formidable battle prowess.  

Hundred Refinements Mountain excelled in artifact forging and alchemy. While they might not be the strongest in direct combat, half of the Great Heavy Mountain region's spiritual pills and magical tools originated from them.  

As for Scripture Valley, Jiang Li had initially assumed it was an ancient sect, given the weighty implication of its name.  

Surprisingly, it was the youngest of the four, with a history of barely two centuries. It had been founded by a group of rogue cultivators, reportedly after the exploration of an ancient ruin—though the specifics were beyond the reach of their low-level informants.  

As they spoke, the Ascension Assembly grounds came into view.  

It resembled an otherworldly paradise—a small town composed of wooden courtyards of varying sizes.  

The area was already bustling with activity. Countless preparatory disciples, all under sixteen and brimming with excitement, moved in and out of the courtyards.  

"Alright, young masters and ladies! Welcome to the Ascension Assembly! Here, you'll choose your future sects and follow your senior brothers and elders back to begin your cultivation."  

"I, Fu Zhong, can only take you this far. You may now enter the grounds and select your sects."  

"Each courtyard represents a sect, and at every entrance stands a stone tablet with information about them."  

"You may examine each tablet, but heed this warning: once you pledge allegiance to a sect, there's no turning back. Betrayal will be met with eradication."  

"Lastly, if you wish to join the Ascension Pavilion, proceed to the seventh courtyard on the left."  

With a final glance at the crowd, Fu Zhong vanished on the spot.  

The preparatory disciples entered the grounds, mingling with earlier arrivals.  

Jiang Li and Yan Hong, followed by their nineteen subordinates, made straight for Shu Mountain Five Elements Peak's courtyard.  

A sizable crowd had already gathered there—unsurprising, given the sect's reputation as the Great Heavy Mountain region's premier immortal sect.  

A young man stood holding a rusted sword pointed forward, while an aloof-looking youth gently placed a sheet of white paper against its edge.  

"The paper remains uncut—disqualified!"  

With those words, the sword-wielding youth dejectedly returned the rusted blade and slunk back into the crowd.  

"The test seems to involve cutting paper with a rusted sword without swinging it," Jiang Li muttered, baffled.  

Was there some hidden trick to the rusted sword?  

He cast an Appraisal skill without hesitation.  

**[Name: Rusted Iron Sword]**  
**[Type: Weapon]**  
**[Grade: None]**  
**[Note: A useless piece of junk.]**  

It really was just an ordinary rusted sword.  

"Senior Brother, could you demonstrate how this test works? We're a bit lost," Jiang Li finally asked after watching several more failures.  

The Five Elements Peak swordsman cracked an eyelid, shooting Jiang Li a disdainful glance.  

But he still drew a rusted sword from beside him, held it horizontally, and placed a sheet of paper on its edge.  

The paper drifted downward—yet instead of catching on the blunt blade, it slid smoothly through, splitting cleanly in two midair.  

Jiang Li gaped. This defied all logic!  

"A rusty sword does not mean a rusty heart. This is fundamental for any swordsman."  

The senior brother smirked at their stunned expressions, pleased with his successful display.  

"May I try, Senior Brother?"  

Jiang Li took the sword and gave it a sharp flick. With a metallic ring, clumps of rust shook loose, improving the blade's appearance.  

"Senior Brother, let's go!"  

The swordsman's eye twitched. Did this guy really think he could cheat so blatantly?  

Still, he didn't care. He placed another sheet of paper on the sword.  

Unsurprisingly, Jiang Li—long corrupted by worldly distractions—had no connection to the Sword Heart. Shaking off rust couldn't substitute for sharpening, and the paper remained stubbornly uncut.  

Yan Hong fared no better.  

Defeated, the two retreated from the courtyard.
