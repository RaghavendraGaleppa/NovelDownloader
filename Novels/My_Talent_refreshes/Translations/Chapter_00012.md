# Chapter 12: Qi Refining Third Layer

Like when practicing other spells before, Chu Ning first reviewed the incantation in his mind, circulated his spiritual energy, and formed the hand seals. Then, he pointed toward the sky.

Silently, nothing happened in the air. Seeing this, Chu Ning couldn't help but freeze. If not for clearly sensing the consumption of his spiritual energy, he would have thought he hadn't cast the spell at all.

"This spell consumes much more spiritual energy than the Purification Technique, yet it still failed?"

Unwilling to accept it, Chu Ning tried again, but there was still no reaction. After several attempts, he finally had to face the fact that without the Yin Wood Spirit Body enhancement, his talent was indeed quite mediocre. Even a basic water-element spell like the Nourishing Rain Technique had easily stumped him.

"It seems that under current circumstances, my best option is still to practice wood-element spells. Other elemental spells are too laborious and progress too slowly. I wonder if there will be other talent rewards as I break through later."

Chu Ning immersed his mind into the system again.

[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Grade Low Tier), First Layer (62/300)]

The Evergreen Wood Technique had gained 1 proficiency point from last night's cultivation, but the Purification Technique, Growth Acceleration Technique, and Nourishing Rain Technique he had just practiced still didn't appear. By now, Chu Ning had vaguely figured something out—his proficiency system only worked for cultivation techniques, not spells.

Moreover, Chu Ning faintly felt that even for cultivation techniques, there might be certain limitations. Otherwise, if he could casually practice other techniques and receive rewards, this golden finger probably wouldn't have such loopholes.

"The Nine Yin Body Forging Technique can also grant rewards—does that mean body-refining techniques are also effective?" Chu Ning noted this down, planning to test it later when he found a suitable body-refining technique.

For now, his top priority was to continue cultivating the Evergreen Wood Technique, improving both his proficiency and his cultivation level.

Thus, in the following period, Chu Ning returned to his previous routine. He practiced the technique morning and night at his residence, and during the day, under Cao Dongxin's instructions, he went to the fields to drive away pests and birds and remove weeds. Due to frequent use, his Purification Technique became increasingly proficient. Naturally, the same went for the Wood Spring Technique, as he used it daily to rapidly enhance his Evergreen Wood Technique.

Chu Ning also practiced the Growth Acceleration Technique and Nourishing Rain Technique. The former went smoothly, but the latter's progress was indeed slow. Although Chu Ning could eventually cast it, neither the rainfall amount nor the spiritual energy consumption satisfied him. This forced him to accept the fact that aside from wood-element techniques and spells, his talents in other areas were mediocre.

In the blink of an eye, Chu Ning had been at Qingxi Sect for nearly three months. These two-plus months had been highly routine for him—rising with the sun and resting at dusk, working and cultivating in the fields during the day, and cultivating and resting at night. Every half-month, he visited the Technique Transmission Hall to learn spells and basic spiritual plant knowledge.

After several visits, Chu Ning learned the incantations for the Blade Edge Technique, Object Control Technique, and Wind Riding Technique from Shi Yao. The Blade Edge Technique had some offensive power but was mainly used for harvesting spiritual plants. The Object Control Technique was relatively common in the cultivation world and had practical uses in spiritual plant cultivation, such as sowing and harvesting, making it a basic spell.

However, when Chu Ning asked for other spell incantations, Shi Yao refused, saying that trying to grasp too much would lead to mastering none and advising Chu Ning to focus on his cultivation technique.

One day, Chu Ning followed Cao Dongxin to the fields as usual. The Red Spirit Rice, after two months of growth, had plumped up and turned completely crimson—it was time for harvest. By now, Chu Ning was no longer a novice in farming. He knew that the Red Spirit Rice Cao Dongxin treasured was actually low-grade among spiritual plants. Most cultivators in Qingxi Sect, except for low-ranking servant disciples, rarely ate this rice. It was mainly used as coarse grain, with a significant portion serving as feed for spirit beasts.

Harvesting this rice could be done with ordinary knives, but it would be too slow. The two of them used the Blade Edge Technique instead. Previously, Chu Ning had demonstrated the Nourishing Rain Technique more often in front of Cao Dongxin—naturally, because it was his least proficient spell. Now, he used the Blade Edge Technique in front of Cao Dongxin.

Cao Dongxin cast the Blade Edge Technique on a row of rice stalks, which fell neatly in place. Then, with a Purification Technique and Object Control Technique, he separated the grains from the straw and collected them in a basket. He then glanced at Chu Ning and, seeing that his Blade Edge Technique had only cut a few stalks, couldn't help but smile slightly. Chu Ning's rapid entry into Qi Refining had previously left him feeling sour. Now, seeing Chu Ning's mediocre performance with the Blade Edge Technique, he felt much more balanced.

After finishing his own harvesting for the day, Cao Dongxin said to Chu Ning, "Harvest this entire area today. Remember, it must be done by the end of the day." With that, he turned and leisurely walked back to his residence.

Though Chu Ning had entered Qi Refining quickly, in three months, his cultivation couldn't have progressed much. Seeing his poor mastery of the Nourishing Rain and Blade Edge Techniques, Cao Dongxin assumed his Growth Acceleration and Purification Techniques couldn't be much better either. With only Qi Refining first-layer cultivation and subpar spell proficiency, even if the sect allowed Chu Ning to farm independently, the land assigned to him would be inferior and limited in size. The thought of Chu Ning's future struggles inexplicably lifted Cao Dongxin's mood.

After Cao Dongxin left, Chu Ning continued practicing the Blade Edge Technique—not just to meet Cao Dongxin's demands but also to improve his proficiency for future farming. After all, as a metal-element spell, there were no shortcuts for Chu Ning. However, his Blade Edge Technique was actually much better than what Cao Dongxin had seen. With the support of Qi Refining third-layer spiritual energy, even if his Blade Edge Technique wasn't perfect, harvesting Red Spirit Rice was more than manageable.

Yes, after over two months of cultivation, Chu Ning had already reached Qi Refining third layer. When his Evergreen Wood Technique first-layer proficiency broke 100, he advanced to the second layer, and after breaking 200, he reached the third layer. Now, with a thought, he could see his progress in his mind.

[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Grade Low Tier), First Layer (299/300)]

After two months of cultivation, with ten days left before the three-month assessment, Chu Ning's Evergreen Wood Technique first-layer proficiency was nearing completion. He planned to push through tonight and fully master the last point of proficiency. When his Nine Yin Body Forging Technique had reached completion, his talent had refreshed, granting him the Yin Wood Spirit Body. He wondered what changes the completion of the Evergreen Wood Technique's first layer would bring.
