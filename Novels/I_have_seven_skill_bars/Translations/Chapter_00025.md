# Chapter 25: The Green Hornet's Enlightenment

Dong Feng and Qing Yu embraced each other. Qing Yu truly relished their brief moments alone, but Dong Feng's eyes gazed at the starlit night sky, a frown on his face. Although Qing Yu believed she had persuaded her Dao companion, it wasn't so easy in reality. Dong Feng still harbored prejudice against Ding Rui, though he no longer harbored thoughts of revenge. He looked up at the sky and muttered to himself, "Am I really not as strong as you? I simply refuse to believe it. You may be more valued now, you may be a Spirit Farmer, but a Spirit Farmer is still just a Spirit Farmer. When I become an elite Outer Sect disciple, or even when I cultivate to the Condensing Sea stage and become an Inner Sect disciple, then everyone will see who is truly formidable, who is stronger, who is more talented..."

The sun set in the west. Ding Rui, looking refreshed, walked into Spirit Field 377 from outside. He went out twice every day, once at noon and once in the evening, using his skills hundreds of times each trip. His proficiency in simultaneously using both [Golden Ray Spear] and [Weeding] was rapidly increasing.

"That's no problem!" Ding Rui chuckled. With his skill slots, he believed he could revitalize even the most barren ordinary soil.
"Alright, there's probably nothing else then. Next, you need to become a Spirit Farmer as soon as possible. Once you have your own spirit field, just plant some high-quality, fragrant spirit flowers. Otherwise, don't blame me if it dislikes your poverty and runs away," Mi reminded him.
Ding Rui's eyes widened instantly. "It can run away?"
"Why wouldn't it? Do you think we bee cultivators are fools?" Mi finished, nudging Ding Rui's nose, then flapped her wings and flew into the valley flower field.
A sense of urgency immediately seized Ding Rui. He didn't want the Green Hornet to leave him because it found him poor.

He found Li Yizhen, who was cultivating by the field during her break. Li Yizhen had already seen Ding Rui approaching and wasn't too deeply immersed in her cultivation. She quickly stabilized her True Essence, cleared her mind, and glanced at Ding Rui, asking, "What is it?"
"The Green Hornet is about to gain enlightenment, and Sister Mi said it would be best to get some valley flower seeds for it to collect nectar. I was wondering... if it would be convenient," Ding Rui said.
"The Green Hornet?" Li Yizhen frowned. "What a strange name. Wait here!"
With that, she stood up and walked towards a nearby thatched hut.
Ding Rui waited for a while, and then Li Yizhen returned with a small pouch.
"Inside are valley flower seeds, along with some notes on things to pay attention to during planting. Take them and read them yourself, don't expect me to teach you," Li Yizhen said.

Having been able to meet frequently and cultivate their feelings, Qing Yu walked through the main gate. Upon seeing Ding Rui in the spirit field, she immediately frowned. Valley flowers were generally managed by female cultivators, who were considered more meticulous; male cultivators rarely got involved.
What was this male cultivator doing here?
Could he be a Dao companion of one of the female cultivators?
Li Yizhen's, perhaps?
Qing Yu's face was full of suspicion. She knew all the female cultivators in Spirit Field 56 and had never known any of them to have a Dao companion.
