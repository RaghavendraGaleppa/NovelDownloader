# Chapter 50: There's a Problem With Your Spiritual Roots

Returning to Willow Town, Xiao Ji bid farewell to Song Yuanbao at the yamen.  

Song Yuanbao personally escorted the Taoist priest to the gates of Yuanshen Temple. Just as he was about to leave, Xiao Ji suddenly turned back and said, "Constable Song, have you been stuck at the third level of Qi Refining for a long time?"  

The question triggered a simple recollection in Song Yuanbao's mind.  

He remembered a sweltering summer day.  

Back then, he had been rolling around in a muddy pond outside his village with a group of friends when an old martial arts instructor from the city spotted him. The man praised his exceptional bone structure, declaring him a martial arts prodigy with triple spiritual roots. After speaking with his father, the instructor took him to the city.  

Tests confirmed his talent, and many hailed him as a natural genius. By the age of twelve, he had already reached the third level of Qi Refining in martial arts. Yet, in the years that followed, his progress stalled.  

The old instructor consulted several martial arts masters, all of whom agreed that with triple spiritual roots, his cultivation speed shouldn't have plateaued. Eventually, they visited a major cultivation sect nearby and paid to have his spiritual roots tested with specialized equipment.  

The results remained unchanged—triple spiritual roots.  

After the old instructor passed away, Song Yuanbao left that place and wandered until he arrived at Longxiang County. With his third-level Qi Refining abilities, he became a constable in Willow Town.  

Though his cultivation path had been blocked, reaching the third level of Qi Refining was enough to secure a decent livelihood. He had long accepted his fate and forgotten about further cultivation—until the Taoist priest brought it up again, stirring an inexplicable melancholy in his heart.  

"Taoist Master Xiao, to be honest, I've been stuck at the third level of Qi Refining for over twenty years," Song Yuanbao admitted seriously. "Triple spiritual roots, yet only at the third level—it's laughable."  

"Let me take a look." Xiao Ji circled Song Yuanbao, observing him closely. "You do indeed have triple spiritual roots, but..."  

"But what?" Song Yuanbao tensed, his gaze fixed on Xiao Ji.  

There was something indescribable about the Taoist priest before him—an aura that made him feel as though the man could solve any problem.  

Of course, he knew this was Willow Town, a mundane place where any cultivation sects that existed were considered insignificant. Even the Guixian Sect, situated on the outskirts of Longxiang County and hailed as a major cultivation faction, ultimately relied on the mundane world for survival and couldn't even rank among the top three in the Taoist Alliance.  

Everyone knew that true major sects were far removed from the mundane world, hidden in remote mountains that ordinary people could scarcely reach—places abundant in spiritual energy, herbs, stones, and beasts...  

Yet Taoist Master Xiao was an exception, a man whose every word inspired unwavering belief.  

Even if he was just a priest from the least spiritual temple in Willow Town.  

But the temple's lack of incense and spiritual energy was Yuanshen Temple's problem—what did that have to do with Taoist Master Xiao?  

**[Song Yuanbao, Constable of Willow Town, triple spiritual roots, third level of martial Qi Refining... His spiritual roots are unusual, growing in an inverted manner...]**  

"It's just that your spiritual roots are growing a bit oddly," Xiao Ji said, pinpointing the root of Song Yuanbao's stagnation.  

"How so?" Song Yuanbao pressed urgently.  

"They're growing upside down." Xiao Ji didn't mince words.  

Song Yuanbao, the square-faced constable, was a decent man who had been prompt with his rewards. Since they would likely collaborate often in the future, there was no harm in being straightforward.  

"What do you mean?" As a martial artist, Song Yuanbao only knew that spiritual roots determined one's cultivation speed and potential, but he wasn't familiar with the finer details. All he cared about was how to continue cultivating.  

His tone was anxious, and his eyes shone with hope.  

"I mean exactly what I said—they're growing in reverse, upside down." Xiao Ji kept it simple.  

Though Song Yuanbao didn't know how Taoist Master Xiao had discerned this, he trusted there had to be a reason. Whether his spiritual roots grew upside down or sideways wasn't particularly important.  

What mattered now was whether there was a way to continue cultivating and break through to the fourth level of martial Qi Refining.  

"So... how do I fix them? How do I get them to grow the right way and keep cultivating?" Song Yuanbao asked.  

"Spiritual roots are innate, unlike bones. You can forcibly adjust bones, but not spiritual roots," Xiao Ji said casually, as if discussing vegetables at a market. "However, if you want to keep cultivating and break through to the fourth level, there is a way."  

"Please, Taoist Master, tell me! If I, Song Yuanbao, can truly advance beyond the third level, I'll—" Song Yuanbao grew emotional.  

Xiao Ji cut him off. "If I help you continue cultivating, all I ask is that you come to me first whenever there's a case involving demons. If my method works, that's my only condition."  

The request was practically no request at all.  

Song Yuanbao's excitement dimmed slightly, and he regained some composure. "You have my word, Taoist Master. Even if you didn't help me, I'd still seek you out—after all, I need results too."  

His words were honest, perfectly capturing the mutually beneficial nature of their arrangement.  

Xiao Ji got to the point.  

"Since your spiritual roots are inverted, you simply need to cultivate upside down," Xiao Ji offered a solution that sounded almost too simple. "When no one's around, try to walk, eat, drink, sleep—do everything upside down."  

In short, if something could be done upside down, don't bother doing it upright.  

The reason for doing this in private was purely to preserve dignity—otherwise, people would surely gossip.  

It was a concept that was hard to grasp.  

"If my colleagues see me upside down, they might start wondering if I'm some kind of bat demon," Song Yuanbao joked, a rare moment of levity.  

"Don't worry about what others think. If you can discipline yourself, you'll break through to the fourth level of martial Qi Refining within a year," Xiao Ji assured him. "By then, you'll be accustomed to doing things upside down, and your cultivation path afterward will proceed smoothly..."  

Xiao Ji's words were like an anchor, steadying Song Yuanbao's heart and painting a vision of his future self standing at the pinnacle of martial arts.  

Song Yuanbao, the legendary constable and martial arts titan.  

"Thank you for your guidance, Taoist Master Xiao," Song Yuanbao said, excitement tinged with embarrassment. "Ah, look at me—I didn't even bring a gift today."  

"From what I recall, you escorted me from the yamen to the temple gates. Strictly speaking, you didn't exactly 'come over' with the intention to visit," Xiao Ji said kindly, diffusing the awkwardness. "This is far enough. Until next time."  

They parted ways.  

Xiao Ji entered the temple gates.  

Song Yuanbao's square face glowed with newfound vigor. As he walked away, he suddenly flipped upside down and began sprinting on his hands.  

The sight turned many heads.  

"What the hell just ran past?" was the general reaction.
