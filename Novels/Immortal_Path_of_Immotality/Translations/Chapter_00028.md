# Chapter 28: Spiritual Awakening  

Lin Shan returned to his residence just as a carriage pulled up to his gate. He quickly directed several antique shop assistants to carry the golden bell inside. After giving each a small tip, they left happily.  

Locking the courtyard gate and ensuring all windows and doors were secure, Lin Shan approached the golden bell with barely contained excitement, his eyes gleaming like a starved man beholding a peerless beauty. He reached out and placed a hand on it.  

**[Soul Suppression Bell]**  
Quality: Ordinary  
Description: Originally a Buddhist dharma artifact powered by vows, its spiritual essence has been forcibly erased, reducing it to a mundane object.  
Ancient Aura: 8 points.  
Absorb?  

...  

"Absorb!"  

Every absorption of Ancient Aura sent Lin Shan into euphoria, a fleeting sensation akin to soaring through the clouds.  

With his Ancient Aura restored to 16 points, Lin Shan felt a surge of determination. This was his chance! Today would determine whether he could cultivate immortality and whether he possessed spiritual roots.  

Suddenly, he noticed something unusual. He flicked the bell with his finger.  

*Ding~*  

A soft chime echoed, leaving Lin Shan stunned.  

"It didn't shatter? Normally, it should have turned to dust!"  

After thorough examination, he confirmed that aside from losing its Ancient Aura, the bell remained intact.  

"Perhaps because it was once a dharma artifact? The materials used might not be ordinary, preventing it from crumbling."  

Lin Shan pondered for a while but ultimately dismissed the thought. His priority now was determining his eligibility for cultivation.  

...  

Sitting cross-legged on his bed, he retrieved the two innate-level cultivation manuals obtained from Nightingale.  

The first, *Precious Yellow Scripture*, appeared to be an earth-attribute technique, while the second, *Mayfly's Thread of Heaven*, was more enigmatic. Since the five basic elemental roots—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—were the most common, Lin Shan decided to test the earth-attribute manual first.  

He opened the enhancement interface for *Precious Yellow Scripture*.  

**[Precious Yellow Scripture]**  
Quality: Innate-Level Technique  
Description: Can be cultivated to the peak of the Innate Realm. The technique emphasizes sturdiness, granting formidable defensive capabilities with moderate offensive power. Practitioners may experience increased weight and slight mobility hindrance.  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

Ignoring the details, Lin Shan decisively chose to enhance it. The interface shimmered before him.  

...  

**[Earthbound Art]**  
Quality: Qi Refinement Technique  
Description: Earth-attribute cultivation method, cultivatable up to the ninth level of Qi Refinement. The spiritual energy is gentle and robust, excelling in defense.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

"*Earthbound Art*!"  

Though the description was plain, Lin Shan wasn't picky. The first step was simply to enter the world of cultivation.  

After thoroughly studying the manual and understanding the method to sense spiritual energy, Lin Shan sat upright and began his attempt.  

...  

Three hours later, his face darkened. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't sense even a wisp of earth-attribute spiritual energy in his surroundings.  

According to his understanding of the manual, while individuals varied in spiritual root aptitude, even the weakest should at least sense the corresponding energy. Failure to do so meant one lacked the root entirely.  

With a heavy heart, Lin Shan turned to his last hope—*Mayfly's Thread of Heaven*.  

**[Mayfly's Thread of Heaven]**  
Quality: Innate-Level Technique  
Description: Can be cultivated to the peak of the Innate Realm. The energy is light and agile, significantly enhancing movement flexibility.  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

Staring at his remaining 8 points of Ancient Aura, Lin Shan clenched his teeth. "Enhance!"  

**[Zephyr Mantra]**  
Quality: Qi Refinement Technique  
Description: Wind-attribute cultivation method, cultivatable up to the ninth level of Qi Refinement. The spiritual energy is light and swift, greatly improving movement speed.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

Lin Shan ran his fingers over *Zephyr Mantra*. He had braced himself for surprises, but the gamble still sent his heart racing.  

While he had hoped for one of the five basic elemental roots, wind, thunder, and ice roots were exceptionally rare even among cultivators.  

"Cross the bridge when we come to it," he muttered, burying himself in study.  

...  

Two hours later, after a quick meal, Lin Shan began practicing the *Sensing Chapter* of *Zephyr Mantra*.  

To his astonishment, unlike his previous attempts, he immediately felt a subtle yet distinct difference in the surrounding energy.  

It was indescribable—mysterious and profound.  

Without wasting time, he immersed himself in this sensation, like a fish navigating the vast ocean.  

After what felt like an eternity, he suddenly broke through into a new realm. His surroundings transformed into an interplay of light and shadow, with countless cyan specks drifting lazily around him.  

Recalling the manual's teachings, Lin Shan realized—  

"This is spiritual awakening!"  

Spiritual sense, also called divine sense, allowed cultivators to inspect their bodies internally and extend their awareness outward. At higher realms, it could be used for scouting, telepathic communication, and even controlling flying swords!  

Possessing spiritual sense marked the beginning of true cultivation—the transformation of one's essence and the ability to absorb spiritual energy from the world.  

"I succeeded! I actually possess a wind spiritual root!"  

Lin Shan opened his eyes in disbelief. The cyan specks he had sensed were wind-attribute spiritual energy—his ticket into the world of cultivation.  

Overwhelmed with excitement, he leaped from his bed, his throat dry with exhilaration.  

He could finally cultivate! From now on, he would stand above mere martial artists, surpassing 99% of humanity and stepping onto the path of immortality—a divide as vast as heaven and earth!  

But then he looked down and saw his body covered in black filth—impurities expelled during his spiritual awakening. The process had naturally cleared his meridians, effectively refining his body.  

...  

"Wait... Isn't clearing the meridians what happens when a martial artist breaks through to the Innate Realm?"  

Lin Shan felt a sudden epiphany, connecting the dots.  

Opening the window, he was greeted by bright sunlight. To his amazement, he could now see the intricate patterns on a cicada's wings perched on the courtyard's banyan tree and even observe the rhythmic pulsing of its abdomen as it chirped.  

His hearing had sharpened as well—he could detect the faint rustling of a centipede underground, the hushed conversations of neighbors outside his courtyard, and the buzzing of insects in the air. The world had come alive in vivid detail.  

"Enhanced senses!"  

The term wasn't merely figurative—it was a hallmark of Innate Realm experts.  

Body refinement,  
Enhanced senses,  
Inner illumination,  
Energy projection!  

These were the defining traits of an Innate expert—the pinnacle of the martial world.  

"I'll have to test whether I can achieve inner illumination and energy projection once I cultivate spiritual energy, but it's likely.  

Now I'm certain—reaching the Qi Refinement stage is equivalent to transcending the Innate Realm! The two may share similarities in early stages, but there's an undeniable chasm in their foundations."  

Lin Shan clenched his fists in triumph.  

"Innate martial artists remain at the rudimentary stage of refining essence into energy, while cultivators have already embarked on the path of unifying energy and spirit, transcending mortal sustenance."  

Every cultivation manual's preface stated the same truth:  

The Dao of cultivation follows four stages—  
Refining essence into energy,  
Refining energy into spirit,  
Refining spirit into void,  
Refining void into Dao.  

This was the immortal path witnessed by sages since ancient times.  

As long as one advanced step by step, immortality would one day be within reach!
