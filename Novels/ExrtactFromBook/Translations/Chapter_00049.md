# Chapter 49: Beheading  

The giant ape continued its pursuit of the merchant house!  

With each thunderous step, massive destruction followed in its wake. The Meat-Cutting Outpost had entered its final countdown to annihilation!  

At that moment, a dazzling sword light flashed across the battlefield, slicing past the ape's arm and cutting deep into its side. The blade struck true, opening a wound on the ape's face—Yang Fan of the Sword House had arrived!  

Against all odds, he had managed to halt the ape's advance.  

"Xu Yuan! Why aren't you making your move? What are you waiting for?" Yang Fan's voice, amplified by his spiritual energy, echoed across the battlefield.  

As the only third-stage cultivator remaining in the Meat-Cutting Outpost, Xu Yuan was the only one capable of standing against the giant ape. Yang Fan, relying solely on the superior agility and offensive power of a sword cultivator, could only delay the beast for so long.  

Meanwhile, the merchant house, which had been sent tumbling earlier, suddenly rose like a great ship! Bathed in a radiant glow, it transformed into a massive magical artifact, hovering in midair.  

From its windows, countless war artifacts emerged, unleashing a relentless barrage of attacks upon the giant ape. The torrent of spiritual energy, though not enough to inflict serious damage, sent the beast staggering.  

On the other side of the merchant house, more war artifacts extended outward, bombarding the demonic beasts at the border and dealing significant casualties. The merchant house's intervention temporarily stabilized the crumbling battlefield, giving everyone a brief respite.  

But the giant ape was far from done.  

Its back muscles convulsed violently as two enormous tumors bulged beneath its skin. Moments later, the tumors burst open, revealing two additional arms!  

"Three Heads, Six Arms!" Yang Fan gasped in alarm.  

Among those present, only he—a core disciple of a major sect—could recognize the terrifying significance of the ape's dual divine abilities: *Heaven and Earth Manifestation* and *Three Heads, Six Arms*.  

This was no ordinary third-stage demon beast.  

This was a supreme demonic saint—a true seed of immortality!  

With two additional arms, the ape's strength grew even more overwhelming. It used two limbs to deflect incoming spells while the remaining two reached skyward, attempting to seize the merchant house.  

The merchant house's glow intensified, barely managing to withstand the assault.  

Yet the ape's transformation was far from complete.  

Soon, two more thick, muscular arms sprouted from its body, followed by a second head emerging from its neck. The ape's aura surged, its spiritual energy skyrocketing.  

Multiple arms hammered relentlessly against the merchant house, causing its protective glow to flicker violently—as if it were on the verge of collapse.  

And still, Xu Yuan did not strike.  

As the merchant house's defenses weakened, Xu Yuan's voice finally rang out from within:  

"The demonic forces are too powerful! We cannot defeat them head-on!"  

"Fellow cultivators, retreat eastward at once!"  

"Preserve our strength! Once the demon beast leaves, we can rebuild the Meat-Cutting Outpost!"  

With that, the merchant house ignored all protests and surged eastward at full speed.  

The sudden betrayal stunned everyone. Despair spread like wildfire as countless cultivators felt their resolve shatter.  

"Xu Yuan! How dare you?!"  

"If you flee now, the Azure Lotus Sword Sect will ensure you never find refuge in Gui Province again!"  

"I've already sent word to my sect! Reinforcements will arrive within two hours! Xu Yuan, don't make a mistake you'll regret!"  

Yang Fan was livid.  

As the Azure Lotus Sword Sect's appointed guardian of the outpost, he could never accept such a disgraceful surrender—especially not one so cowardly.  

Inside the merchant house, the core members, including the various department heads, had gathered outside Xu Yuan's red-brick pavilion, protesting his decision.  

Even most of the merchant house's own people rejected his choice.  

But the will of a third-stage cultivator was absolute. Without the strength to oppose him, their resistance was futile.  

The merchant house pressed on, speeding eastward without hesitation.  

Over the centuries, the merchant house had poured vast resources into refining its headquarters into a colossal magical artifact. Now, propelled by its full power, it soared past the Spirit Sword Gorge and into the heart of Gui Province in mere moments.  

The merchant house's betrayal was catastrophic.  

Morale in the Meat-Cutting Outpost collapsed entirely. Without unified leadership, the defenders fractured into disorganized groups. Some began fleeing, and many war artifacts fell silent.  

The situation was deteriorating rapidly.  

The giant ape, enraged by the merchant house's escape, vented its fury on the outpost.  

Its original purpose had been revenge for the merchant house's schemes against Hu Le'er. Now that Xu Yuan had fled, the ape's primary target was gone.  

Left with no other outlet, it turned its wrath upon the Meat-Cutting Outpost.  

Like a petulant child smashing a painstakingly built sandcastle, the ape stomped through the outpost, crushing every intact structure in sight.  

Blood flowed like rivers.  

Among the remaining cultivators, only Yang Fan still fought desperately.  

The honor of a sword cultivator, the duty to his sect, and the dignity of humanity compelled him to stand against the ape's rampage.  

"This beast has only recently advanced to the third stage! Its divine abilities aren't fully mastered—it hasn't even grown its third head! Victory is still possible!"  

"Fellow Daoists, lend me your strength one last time!"  

Yang Fan's solemn plea rallied the defenders.  

With the merchant house gone, he was now the strongest human cultivator on the battlefield.  

Under his leadership, the survivors launched a final, desperate assault.  

Every last ounce of their spiritual energy and techniques was unleashed upon the giant ape.  

For a brief moment, the sky was alight with radiant brilliance.  

The ape's six arms flailed wildly, dispersing the attacks.  

Meanwhile, Yang Fan hovered in midair, his aura surging to unimaginable heights.  

He had activated the Azure Lotus Sword Sect's forbidden technique—*Jade Shattering Sacrifice*—granting him power nearly equal to a third-stage cultivator for a short time.  

He channeled all of it into his ultimate technique:  

*Sword Qi Thunderclap!*  

In the next instant, the air itself trembled as a deafening roar of sword energy erupted.  

Yang Fan vanished—reappearing behind the ape in a flash—and delivered his strongest strike directly at one of its heads.  

The concentrated sword light was so sharp it seemed to cleave space itself, leaving behind a distorted afterimage.  

The blade struck true, splitting the ape's skull wide open. Brain matter sprayed outward as the beast lost half its life force in an instant.  

But Yang Fan wasn't finished.  

Pushing his limits, he summoned a second sword light, aiming for the ape's remaining head.  

The ape roared in fury, its surviving head twisting into a grotesque snarl as it spat out a condensed blast of spiritual energy.  

The two forces collided—and the ape deflected Yang Fan's strike!
