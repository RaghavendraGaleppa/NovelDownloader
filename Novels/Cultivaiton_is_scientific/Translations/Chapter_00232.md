# Chapter 232: The Grandmaster

"What are the laws of heaven and earth?" Li Yuanba would naturally not miss this opportunity to learn the secrets of a Nascent Soul Grandmaster. He asked his master.

"All things in the world must operate according to certain principles. These principles are the laws. For cultivators, the laws usually touch upon the essence of power, allowing them to unleash the strongest force from the most fundamental level! Take the Divine Footstep as an example. 'Lotus Steps' is a short-distance movement governed by the laws. It may seem merely peculiar, but once a Nascent Soul cultivator truly masters the Divine Footstep, they can traverse a hundred miles in a single step. A simple movement, under the influence of the laws, turns the impossible into reality. Truly something to aspire to!" Sword Elder pondered for a moment, doing his best to explain in terms Li Yuanba could understand, his tone filled with emotion.

He was only at the late Golden Core stage and had yet to touch upon the laws of heaven and earth, so his words were merely hearsay.

Li Yuanba, however, latched onto the idea of "turning the impossible into reality." He thought of the 'Hundred-One Pill Refining Technique' his main body was using in alchemy. Could the micrometer-scale patterns that appeared in one-hundredth of a second be a manifestation of certain laws? The 'Hundred-One Pill Refining Technique' turned the impossible into reality, conjuring pills out of thin air.

His cultivation level was too low. Perhaps once he advanced, he would truly understand these things.

"Your grandmaster has emerged from seclusion. Since you've returned today, I'll take you to meet him!" Sword Elder, not wanting to dwell on topics even he couldn't fully grasp, changed the subject.

"As you command, Master!" Li Yuanba nodded in agreement.

"Your grandmaster's surname is Lu. Remember that, so you won't be caught off guard if outsiders mention him!" Sword Elder led Li Yuanba away from Ten Thousand Swords Peak, flying while giving instructions.

Li Yuanba felt somewhat nervous. This was a genuine Nascent Soul Grandmaster.

"Ahead is the Three Saints Peak, a restricted area of the sect. Of course, even if you wanted to approach, the sect's grand formation would stop you!" Sword Elder pointed to the three tallest peaks ahead.

Li Yuanba had never toured the sect's territory before. His knowledge of the sect's layout came solely from maps. Seeing the Three Saints Peak in person, he was struck by their towering majesty—like three celestial beings standing between heaven and earth, or pillars supporting the sky.

Sword Elder took out his identity jade tablet and cast a spell toward the leftmost peak.

"Enter!" Moments later, a voice sounded beside Sword Elder and Li Yuanba.

Sword Elder motioned to Li Yuanba, then suppressed his sword light and flew toward the left peak of Three Saints Peak.

Upon entering the grand formation protecting the Three Saints Peak, Li Yuanba immediately sensed the difference in spiritual energy. The concentration here was, of course, three times higher than that of his cave dwelling.

But concentration wasn't the most significant difference. The most important distinction was the quality of the spiritual energy—so high that Li Yuanba had never imagined such a level could exist. If he could cultivate here, his progress would likely double or more.

This was because the superior quality of the spiritual energy greatly increased the conversion rate into spiritual power, allowing for greater accumulation in the same amount of time.

He knew, however, that cultivating here was impossible. Even his current cave dwelling at Ten Thousand Swords Peak already exceeded the sect's standard allocations. This was the cultivation ground of a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, likely situated atop the main spiritual vein of the Dark Forest Sect. No wonder the spiritual energy was so abundant.

Lost in thought, he followed Sword Elder to the summit of the left peak, where a majestic hall stood amidst the clouds and mist. This grand hall was only visible after entering the formation—those outside had no chance of seeing it.

Sword Elder led the way into the hall with practiced ease. Seated on the central chair was a middle-aged man, completely different from the white-bearded elder Li Yuanba had imagined.

"Master, I've brought my personal disciple to pay his respects!" Sword Elder bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Grandmaster!" Li Yuanba also bowed.

The middle-aged man smiled, glancing at Sword Elder before studying Li Yuanba with interest.

"So you've finally taken a disciple. I was beginning to think you had no intention of leaving your legacy in the sect!" Grandmaster Lu teased.

"Master, I promised you that I would pass down the 'Sword Intent Soaring Heaven Art' within the sect," Sword Elder replied earnestly.

"It's fortunate you found such a pure swordsman in a demonic sect," Grandmaster Lu said, shaking his head.

Years ago, Grandmaster Lu had rescued Sword Elder, brought him into the Dark Forest Sect, and taken him as a disciple, nurturing him carefully. One of the conditions was that the 'Sword Intent Soaring Heaven Art' would be passed down within the sect.

Grandmaster Lu had never forced Sword Elder—there were many reasons, and the inheritance of the 'Sword Intent Soaring Heaven Art' couldn't be compelled.

At that moment, Grandmaster Lu noticed something amusing: Li Yuanba, a pure swordsman, had actually raised a peak-level Iron Corpse. He didn't mention it—every cultivator had their secrets.

Within his perception, nothing in Li Yuanba's storage space could escape his notice. In front of Grandmaster Lu, Li Yuanba had no secrets left.

Fortunately, Li Yuanba had already transferred some of his most critical items to his main body, Li Shiming. Even if Grandmaster Lu saw items like the Fresnel reflector, he wouldn't understand their purpose.

"Hmm?" Grandmaster Lu spotted something even more peculiar, so unusual that even his composure faltered slightly.

He saw a flying sword treasure—a high-quality one. While it was surprising for an early Foundation Establishment swordsman to possess a flying sword treasure, it was another item that truly caught Grandmaster Lu's attention.

With a wave of his hand, Grandmaster Lu retrieved a corpse from Li Yuanba's storage bracelet.

Li Yuanba's heart skipped a beat. Storage bracelets were far more secure than storage pouches, yet Grandmaster Lu could casually extract items from his. How could he not be shocked?

The corpse Grandmaster Lu retrieved was that of the Six-Fingered Tone Demon. With this corpse, the presence of the flying sword treasure in Li Yuanba's storage bracelet could be explained. Though the Six-Fingered Tone Demon specialized in zither treasures, he wouldn't have only one treasure. For a Foundation Establishment cultivator to explore the Six-Fingered Tone Demon's ruins alone would be unlikely. After several cultivators explored together, Li Yuanba's possession of the flying sword treasure and the corpse could be reasonably justified.

"Master, what is this?" Sword Elder asked, puzzled as to why Grandmaster Lu had taken a corpse from Li Yuanba's storage bracelet.

"Haha, this is the corpse of the Six-Fingered Tone Demon. Old Fiend Li's son was killed by him, and he's been hunting for the Six-Fingered Tone Demon's whereabouts. This corpse can be traded to Old Fiend Li for some good items!" Grandmaster Lu explained with a laugh.

As a Nascent Soul cultivator of a demonic sect, he was unrestrained in his actions. Whether it was his own juniors or cultivators from other sects, as long as their spatial items were of inferior quality, he wouldn't hesitate to inspect them.

"Your disciple is quite good. I like him!" Grandmaster Lu said to Sword Elder with a smile, then turned to Li Yuanba. "I'll take the Six-Fingered Tone Demon's corpse. What would you like in return?"

"Since Grandmaster has use for it, consider it my humble offering!" Li Yuanba replied with a bow.

As an early Foundation Establishment cultivator, whatever Grandmaster Lu could offer would likely be limited to Foundation Establishment-level resources—something Li Yuanba wasn't lacking in. It was better to have Grandmaster Lu owe him a favor.

The Six-Fingered Tone Demon's corpse held no value to him anyway. He'd only kept it thinking it might be useful within the sect.

"How could I take advantage of my junior? Here's my token. Later, go claim a set of Core Formation resources—consider it my reward!" Grandmaster Lu waved his hand and tossed a wooden token to Li Yuanba, who caught it hastily.

Li Yuanba didn't know what "Core Formation resources" were. As he pondered, he heard his master's voice.

"Hurry up and thank your grandmaster!" Sword Elder gave Li Yuanba a light pat.

"Thank you, Grandmaster!" Li Yuanba quickly bowed in gratitude.

After Li Yuanba put away the token, Sword Elder looked at Grandmaster Lu with an expression of disbelief.

"Master, you're really favoring the younger generation! Back then, I had to fight tooth and nail to earn those Core Formation resources!" Sword Elder said with a hint of envy, though he'd waited until Li Yuanba had secured the reward before speaking, clearly not wanting to jeopardize his disciple's gain.

"Haha, you're not doing your duty as a master! You underestimate your disciple. He'll likely reach mid-Foundation Establishment within a year, and he's already prepared a flying sword treasure. That shows his determination to form a core!" Grandmaster Lu said with a grin, freely revealing Li Yuanba's secrets.

"Yuanba's flying sword treasure must have come from Yun Xingyi of the Clear Heart Sect. After he obtained Yun Xingyi's techniques, I knew he must have found the body. Yuanba has his secrets—you can see them, Master, but let the younger generation keep some privacy!" Sword Elder said with a resigned shake of his head.

Sword Elder hailed from the Sword Intent Soaring Heaven Pavilion, which, though not exactly an orthodox sect, hadn't raised him with complete freedom. His master, however, was a Nascent Soul demonic cultivator whose actions grew increasingly unrestrained.

Sword Elder didn't ask how his master could be so certain Li Yuanba would reach mid-Foundation Establishment within a year. It was probably due to some cultivation-boosting treasures in his storage bracelet—secrets Sword Elder had no desire to pry into.

"Only early Foundation Establishment, and he's already encountered Yun Xingyi of the Clear Heart Sect? That was a fine swordsman—what a shame," Grandmaster Lu mused, having heard of Yun Xingyi. He then abruptly changed the subject. "You're preparing to form your Nascent Soul. Are you planning to return?"

"My Core Formation resources aren't fully prepared yet. It'll take at least thirty to fifty years before I have even a slight chance of attempting the Nascent Soul breakthrough. Whether I return to the Sword Intent Soaring Heaven Pavilion will depend on whether I succeed in forming my Nascent Soul," Sword Elder replied after a moment's hesitation.

"Why be so cautious? I've long agreed that once you reach Nascent Soul, you'll have the ability to return to the Sword Intent Soaring Heaven Pavilion on your own. As long as you leave the inheritance behind, that's enough. Now that you've found a successor, do as you please. Don't worry about the sect's opinions—with me here, I can shield you from some of the storms," Grandmaster Lu said with a hearty laugh, waving his hand dismissively.

Li Yuanba stood to the side, not daring to breathe too loudly. This was absolutely confidential information.

His master truly intended to leave the Dark Forest Sect. Li Yuanba thought of Elder Lü's preparations—the forging method and materials for the Ten Thousand Swords Peak. Elder Lü must have known about this and had prepared in advance.

Once Sword Elder either succeeded in forming his Nascent Soul and left or failed and was severely injured or perished, Elder Lü would have the opportunity to claim the Ten Thousand Swords Peak and forge it into his own powerful treasure.

After Grandmaster Lu and Sword Elder conversed for a while, Grandmaster Lu beckoned Li Yuanba forward.

"Grandmaster!" Li Yuanba approached and bowed.

"Don't follow your master's rigid ways, insisting that swordsmen should only use flying swords. A swordsman who can preserve his life is a good swordsman!" Grandmaster Lu said, noticing Sword Elder's look of protest. He glared. "How many life-and-death situations have you been in? One misstep, and it would have been the end. If you'd had more defensive methods, none of that would have happened!"

"Swordsmen need tempering. How else can they refine their sword intent?" Sword Elder couldn't let his master corrupt his disciple and had to object.

Though Grandmaster Lu was a Nascent Soul cultivator, he wasn't a swordsman. In this regard, Sword Elder had more authority. Moreover, the Sword Intent Soaring Heaven Pavilion had produced ascended cultivators, giving them far more experience in nurturing swordsmen than the Dark Forest Sect.

"Fine, you're here to annoy me!" Grandmaster Lu waved his hand dismissively. He then winked at Li Yuanba, as if to say, "I know your little secret, but I won't tell your master."

Li Yuanba understood—Jiang Chen, whom he carried with him, couldn't possibly escape Grandmaster Lu's notice.

"Go claim those Core Formation resources soon. I recall a new batch of pill resources recently arrived. If you miss this chance, who knows how long you'll have to wait for the next?" Sword Elder urged as they left Three Saints Peak.

"Master, are Core Formation resources the materials needed to advance to Golden Core? Isn't it too early for me to claim them now?" Li Yuanba asked, confused.

"You haven't been in the sect long. Core Formation resources include a complete set of medicinal herbs, techniques, and secret methods—all refined by generations of predecessors based on the sect's circumstances to create the optimal Core Formation plan. Your grandmaster is truly generous, giving you a set outright without making you work for it. I'm not sure if that's good or bad," Sword Elder mused.

In truth, Grandmaster Lu didn't want to owe Li Yuanba a favor. Combined with the Six-Fingered Tone Demon's corpse, the benefits he could reap far exceeded the value of a set of Core Formation resources.

More importantly, though Li Yuanba's storage bracelet didn't contain many items, Grandmaster Lu could tell that if he rewarded him with other treasures, Li Yuanba might not even be impressed.

As for artifacts, swordsmen used only flying swords their entire lives. Li Yuanba currently wielded a spirit artifact flying sword, and he'd already prepared a flying sword treasure. Grandmaster Lu couldn't very well reward him with a spirit artifact—that would be beneath his dignity.

As for cultivation resources, after discovering a large bottle of top-grade pills in Li Yuanba's possession, Grandmaster Lu abandoned the idea of providing any.
