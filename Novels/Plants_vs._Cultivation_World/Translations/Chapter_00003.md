# Chapter 3: Solar Essence  

The solution Gu Mo had found was actually quite simple. Since he didn't have a spiritual field, he would create one artificially by burying spirit stones and other spirit energy-rich items directly into the soil, thereby enhancing the spiritual energy of that patch of land.  

However, this method had a significant drawback: once the spirit energy in the buried stones was exhausted, the spiritual energy of the land would vanish as well. Only genuine spiritual fields supported by spirit veins could maintain an endless supply of energy.  

But for Gu Mo, this was his only way out. Fortunately, he had three spirit stones on hand to test the method. Without hesitation, he quickly returned to his hut, fetched a pot, dug up some soil from outside, and buried the three cracked spirit stones inside. Three low-grade spirit stones should be enough to elevate a pot-sized patch of land to the level of a first-tier spiritual field.  

After completing the transformation of his miniature artificial spiritual field, Gu Mo planted the Sunflower seed directly into the soil. Now, all he could do was wait.  

If all went well, he would know the results by the next day. As long as the planting conditions were met, the Sunflower would sprout immediately. After carefully inspecting the pot, Gu Mo resumed his cultivation.  

A night of cultivation yielded no progress as usual, but the pot had undergone a dramatic change. Where there had been nothing before, a sunflower-like plant now swayed gently in the morning sunlight.  

"So this is the Sunflower," Gu Mo murmured, examining the plant, which stood only as tall as his forearm. Its stem was straight, adorned with two palm-sized leaves.  

The most striking feature, however, was the flower itself. While it resembled a sunflower, Gu Mo thought it looked more like a miniature sun. As the sun rose in the sky, the flower's hue gradually shifted from a warm red to a golden yellow.  

Moreover, the Sunflower's golden disk continuously tracked the sun's movement. Intrigued, Gu Mo moved the pot to the windowsill, allowing direct sunlight to bathe the plant.  

Under the sunlight, the Sunflower swayed even more vigorously, and the light striking its disk seemed to coalesce.  

"Solar Essence!"  

Gu Mo immediately recognized the condensed radiance gathering in the flower's center. However, the Solar Essence couldn't be harvested yet—it would only be available after sunset.  

He waited in his hut the entire day, not daring to leave for even a moment, fearing something might go wrong in his absence. Fortunately, he had some food and water stored, so he didn’t go hungry.  

Finally, as the last rays of sunlight vanished from the horizon, the Sunflower's golden brilliance dimmed rapidly, though a faint golden glow remained in its disk.  

Gu Mo fixed his gaze on the Sunflower, and the familiar translucent screen appeared before him. This time, an option to "Harvest" was displayed.  

This meant that anyone who couldn’t see the Sunflower’s attribute screen wouldn’t be able to collect the Solar Essence—a huge advantage for Gu Mo.  

Without hesitation, he selected the harvest option. Instantly, the golden light within the Sunflower surged forth, transforming into an egg-sized, ethereal sun that floated into Gu Mo’s palm. The moment he touched it, a warm energy coursed through his entire body.  

"Now, let’s see if this Solar Essence can help me achieve Qi Induction!" Feeling the profound power of the Solar Essence, Gu Mo’s confidence grew.  

Tomorrow was the final deadline. If the Solar Essence failed to help him complete Qi Induction, he would be expelled from the Qinglu Sect.  

Taking a deep breath, Gu Mo swallowed the ethereal sun whole and immediately entered a meditative state. As the Solar Essence entered his body, the warmth intensified. He focused his mind, guiding the energy toward his dantian.  

The process went smoothly, but the ultimate test was whether the Solar Essence could dispel the dark light entrenched in his dantian.  

Finally, the warm energy of the Solar Essence reached his dantian. Like ice melting under the scorching sun, the dark light rapidly dissolved.  

"Success!"  

Overjoyed, Gu Mo watched as the Solar Essence not only eradicated the dark light but also took root in his dantian. With this, he had officially achieved Qi Induction.  

Though the energy he had absorbed wasn’t conventional spiritual energy, Solar Essence was far more potent than ordinary Qi. With this power, Gu Mo’s abilities would surpass those of typical cultivators.  

Exhaling deeply, Gu Mo ended his meditation. The warm energy radiating from his dantian filled him with excitement—he had finally stepped onto the path of cultivation.  

The greatest surprise, however, was the Sunflower from the Black Mist Space. The Solar Essence it produced was undoubtedly a rare treasure, one that would greatly aid his cultivation.  

The next morning, Gu Mo slowly opened his eyes. The joy from the previous night had faded, replaced by frustration. He had assumed that with the dark light gone, his cultivation progress would improve significantly. Yet, the results of his night-long efforts remained disappointingly meager.  

"Low-grade spiritual roots truly make cultivation painfully slow," Gu Mo muttered, shaking his head. While achieving Qi Induction had removed the obstacle of the dark light, it couldn’t change the quality of his spiritual roots. His cultivation speed was still abysmally slow—a clear sign of inferior aptitude.  

But when his gaze fell upon the Sunflower swaying gently in the morning light by the window, hope flickered anew. The Sunflower could produce a portion of Solar Essence daily, compensating for his poor spiritual roots and sluggish cultivation speed.  

Rising to his feet, Gu Mo approached the Sunflower. After observing it for a moment, he grasped the pot—and in the next instant, the Sunflower vanished from the windowsill, stored safely in his Black Mist Space.  

Today marked the end of the three-month trial period. Those who had failed to achieve Qi Induction would be expelled from the Qinglu Sect, while those who succeeded would advance to the next stage of cultivation.  

Since he had to leave, Gu Mo didn’t want to risk leaving the Sunflower unattended in his hut, so he took it with him.  

"So many people!"  

Arriving at the gathering point, Gu Mo saw hundreds of individuals assembled in the square—all newly recruited outer disciples of the sect, selected from several nearby kingdoms. The Qinglu Sect conducted such recruitment every one or two years, depending on demand.  

Scanning the crowd of chatting youths, Gu Mo found a quiet spot to sit. The original owner of his body hadn’t been close to anyone here, which suited Gu Mo just fine.  

After a short wait, the familiar green-robed elder appeared, and the square fell silent.
