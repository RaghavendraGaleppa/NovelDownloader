# Chapter 56: Fist Technique Perfection and Entering the Leisure Martial Pavilion

A martial artist focuses on four aspects: eating, nurturing, training, and soaking. Although Li Xian came from a humble background, through his own strength and opportunities, he had already touched upon three of them: "eating," "training," and "nurturing."

However, regarding the word "soak," he had only heard of it but never seen it.

"Soak" can also be called "bathing," meaning tempering the body with medicinal baths.

Regarding the specific details of the medicinal bath, Uncle Xiang was unclear. After Li Xian took his reward money, he left the accounting room.

"So heavy."

Li Xian weighed the silver in his hand; it was so heavy it bent his wrist. It was the first time he felt the weight of wealth.

Martial artist cultivation was extremely costly. Ten or so taels of silver made no splash in the water, yet for an ordinary person, they couldn't save ten taels in a lifetime.

"Even if I were to go carousing, it would be enough."

"But this money came from luck; I should save it first for future emergencies."

He put the silver into his pocket. Since the money wasn't much, he had to be careful with it.

Returning to the courtyard of the estate guards, there was no one around. Most of the guards had been arranged for patrol duty.

Because Li Xian had just been promoted, he had no shifts scheduled for the next few days, leaving him with plenty of free time.

He found a secluded place, surrounded by vegetation. This was a training ground he often visited, rarely disturbed by others.

He sat cross-legged on the ground, emptied his mind, calmed his breath, and adjusted himself to a martial training state.

"Seize the opportunities, do not slack off."

"No matter the ranks of A, B, C, or D, in the end, they are just illusory titles. Only strength is one's own."

He immediately condensed Qi into threads, starting from the Dantian, and circulated them through the various acupoints again.

When the Qi thread passed the two hundred and fourth acupoint, the Dantian emptied, and the Qi thread could no longer maintain its shape, scattering into his flesh and blood.

He had made progress again.

During the three days in the Bear and Tiger Mountain, Li Xian had no time to practice martial arts. But his internal Qi grew steadily, all because he fed on tigers and bears, greatly replenishing his energy. It made up for the internal Qi that should have been condensed but couldn't be generated due to poor "eating."

"The descendants of noble families eat, nurture, train, and soak with superior conditions. Thus, they can accumulate enough internal Qi with extremely little hard work."

"They can circulate Qi through the meridians early on, locking in their vitality and slowing its decline, allowing their martial path to last longer."

"I may not have their advantages, but I can just walk my current path step by step. There is no need for self-abandonment, nor envy or inferiority."

His right hand swept over his chest pocket, and three pills appeared: Deer Blood Pill, Tiger Blood Pill, Bear Gall Pill...

"Deer Blood Pill is a nourishing pill that strengthens vitality, with a relatively mild medicinal effect. I'll take this one first!"

He swallowed the Deer Blood Pill in one go. The pills bestowed by the Madam were completely different in efficacy from those bought at the Leisure Pill Pavilion.

The difference lay in whether the pills were top-grade or inferior.

The pill entered his stomach, and a warm heat rushed upward, as if a forest of flesh and blood were stampeded by a herd of deer. His muscles trembled slightly.

\[You consumed Deer Blood Pill, proficiency in the Skill: Consumption increased by 12\]

Li Xian used the pill's effect to advance his martial arts.

\[Square Fist\]
\[Proficiency: 4618/5000 Great Mastery\]
\[Proficiency +1\]

Two hours later, the effect of the Deer Blood Pill faded.

His internal Qi became even more condensed.

"Eating and training combined constitute the path of martial cultivation."

Li Xian did not immediately swallow the Tiger Blood Pill. Although the effect of the Deer Blood Pill had passed, the momentum of blood and Qi it stirred had not yet subsided.

A martial artist's physical body is like a lake.

Every time a martial artist practices martial arts and throws fists, blood and Qi are mobilized throughout the body, pulling on the bones, muscles, and tendons, causing ripples on the surface of the lake.

Continuous punching sends ripples spreading out in circles. When the body feels tired, the lake has finally stirred up some waves.

Stirring the waves, making them wash away the surrounding soil—only then will the lake expand, and only then can a martial artist be said to have improved.

Swallowing a pill, its effects volatilizing within the body to stir a great momentum of blood and Qi, is equivalent to directly reaching into the calm "lake" and stirring up layers of waves.

At this moment, practicing martial arts to ride the momentum is like pushing the waves along.

Progress is faster than usual!

\[Your blood and Qi churn, your fist practice flows like a dragon, proficiency +4\]
\[Your body's lake surges, pushing the waves along, proficiency +7\]

In martial cultivation, if you do not advance, you retreat. If the body's lake does not stir up waves, it is like a stagnant pool, destined to dry up one day.

And those who are lazy, even if they persist in practicing martial arts daily, end their practice as soon as the lake stirs slightly.

Thus, they practice day after day, month after month, year after year, but make no progress at all.

Sweat poured down like rain.

Unburdened by patrol duties, Li Xian seized every second, unwilling to waste a moment.

He practiced until his hands went numb and he could no longer punch.

Then he switched to practicing the Breeze Leg.

Although these two martial arts are very basic, the more fundamental the martial art, the wider its application.

Effort invested will never be wasted!

Two days passed in the blink of an eye. Li Xian took one pill each day, consuming the Tiger Blood Pill and the Bear Gall Pill successively.

This was his second time taking the Tiger Blood Pill. Because his Skill: Consumption was already proficient, the effect was slightly better than the last time.

His tendons and bones became tougher, and his strength increased significantly. He hadn't tested exactly how much weight he could carry yet, but he figured he was already among the top among the estate guards.

The Bear Gall Pill was even more extraordinary.

This pill was extremely fishy and bitter after entering the mouth, like chewing on a gallbladder raw. The bitterness was unavoidable and hard to forget for a long time.

But after swallowing it, it immediately turned into a cool current, rushing up to the back of the head, the fontanelle, and the glabella.

White mist seeped out from these three places.

The greatest change was in his eyes. His eyes became clearer, black and white distinct, adding a spiritual charm, and his vision increased significantly.

With the help of the pills, Li Xian's martial arts progress over these two days was also rapid.

\[Square Fist\]
\[Proficiency: 61/10000 Perfection\]
\[Description: After practicing the fist technique diligently, you have finally achieved perfection. Your fist intent is mighty, and your movements are natural. You have broken free from the framework of stances, able to adapt as you please.\]

A casual punch carried the style of a master, possessing its own unique aura.

In terms of Square Fist alone, Pang Long was far inferior.

When Square Fist broke through, it caused his body's lake to surge, and his internal Qi grew, filling up a full half portion!

Circulating Qi through the meridians was no longer far off for him.

After Square Fist reached perfection, Li Xian stopped practicing it.

What should be revealed is revealed, what should be hidden is hidden. When out and about, having a trump card that others cannot anticipate gives one more confidence.

He shifted his focus to the Breeze Leg.

\[Breeze Leg\]
\[Proficiency: 139/1500 Small Accomplishment\]
\[Description: Your leg technique is elegant, like wind brushing against willows. You have brought the Breeze Leg to Small Accomplishment, your leg strength has increased, and it complements the Skill: Running. You have grasped the 'Riding the Wind' characteristic, making you faster.\]

So-called "Riding the Wind" means utilizing the push of the wind to become faster.

Even for an ordinary person, running with the wind at their back increases speed. But after mastering the "Riding the Wind" characteristic, it is as if one can step on the wind itself, becoming faster and lighter.

"Hu!"

Li Xian let out a light breath of turbid air, clenched his fist, and felt his growing strength and increasingly profound internal Qi. His heart was filled with immense peace.

A perfected fist technique!

He had inquired; among the hundreds of estate guards, not a single one had practiced a basic martial art to the Perfection realm.

Because it consumed too much time.

Basic martial arts have very low difficulty, almost no threshold. Even so, from入门 (entry) to Small Accomplishment, a talented person might achieve something after two years of unremitting hard work.

From Small Accomplishment to Great Accomplishment, the time varies—some take a year, others five or six years.

But from Great Accomplishment to Perfection, the path is endless. It depends on talent, bone structure, luck and opportunities, or guidance from a master.

Most martial artists have had the idea of practicing a basic martial art to Perfection. But in the end, they all gave up.

Because after practicing to a certain level, one gradually stops feeling their own progress.

This kind of torment is what truly grinds down the heart and wears away the will.

"My leg technique has also entered Small Accomplishment. My strength... I wonder how it ranks among the B-rank estate guards."

"I can put aside Square Fist for now. It's time to find a chance to go to the Leisure Martial Pavilion and get an intermediate martial art!"
