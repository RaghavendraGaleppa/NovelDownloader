# Chapter 101: Kowtow

The artisan took the weapon, but his arm suddenly stiffened. He reversed his grip and seized Xu Yunfan’s wrist. His originally calm gaze turned sharp in an instant.

"Red Forged Copper Body? Are you from the Divine Weapon Ridge?"

Xu Yunfan was slightly surprised. He shook his head and said, "Not exactly the Divine Weapon Ridge, but there is a connection."

Having practiced the martial arts of the Divine Weapon Ridge, there naturally was a connection. He wasn't lying.

"I see, I see."

The artisan’s sharp gaze softened. His fingers relaxed as he took the broken heavy hammer, his expression carrying a hint of lament.

"Thirty years ago, the Divine Weapon Ridge was smashed by someone, collapsing half the mountain range. The remaining disciples died or scattered. It isn't strange for someone to still practice this hammer style."

Xu Yunfan’s expression shifted slightly. "Were you once a member of the Divine Weapon Ridge?"

The artisan nodded slightly. "My name is Fu Jin. I was a twenty-seventh generation disciple of the Divine Weapon Ridge. I escaped the calamity because I had gone down the mountain to purchase goods back then. It has been nearly twenty years since I arrived at the Sky Crafting Cave."

Sensing a connection to an old friend, Fu Jin found a wine shop, and the two sat opposite each other.

The wine shop was by a window. The moment Fu Jin broke the clay seal, the aroma of the twenty-year-old vintage mixed with the steam spewing from the mechanical beast carriages sliding along the tracks outside, forming a mist.

He stared at the floating green plums in the wine jar, his Adam's apple bobbing three times before he swallowed. After downing a whole jar, he exhaled a breath of alcohol and finally spoke with a somewhat hesitant tone. "The Divine Weapon Ridge... is it doing well?"

Xu Yunfan fell silent for a moment before saying, "The Divine Weapon Ridge has become the Divine Weapon Valley. When I went there, there were only two or three old men, twenty or thirty apprentices, and a dozen or so blacksmiths guarding a few blast furnaces to forge weapons, making ordinary blades."

"Divine Weapon Valley? Good, good, that is good too."

Drunkenness surged onto Fu Jin’s cheeks, finally giving him some courage.

"That year, I happened to be going down the mountain to buy Fireflow Sand from Crimson Flame Mountain. When I returned, I saw from a hundred miles away that the main peak had collapsed half. Magma poured down the cliff face, erasing the statue of the founder carved there..."

"Now there is only a quenching pool left in the valley, which has become an excellent natural iron-smelting pool."

Hearing Xu Yunfan’s words, the wine cup Fu Jin was filling reflected his violently trembling pupils. It took a long time for him to calm his mind.

"The Divine Weapon Ridge held the method to forge divine weapons. It took a thousand years to refine seven divine weapons. One of them was about to break its limits, but someone brought an eighth-grade divine weapon and smashed it on the spot. I wanted to rebuild the Divine Weapon Ridge, but what could I do? I was afraid someone would covet it again, so I didn't even dare to go take a look."

He waved his hand, stopping the topic, and turned to say, "Your heavy hammer is full of killing intent. It can be remelted to store that intent... If you add enough materials, I might be able to forge a heavy weapon of the Sharp Grade."

Xu Yunfan’s expression brightened, and he naturally thanked him repeatedly. He drank with Fu Jin until late at night, and Fu Jin stumbled into the Sky Crafting Cave carrying his broken heavy hammer.

Housing prices in Sky Crafting City were not cheap, slightly more expensive than in Cuibo City, so he found a random place to stay.

The next morning, when Xu Yunfan opened the window, the bronze bells on the eaves were dripping the last drops of night dew.

His ears twitched slightly. He quickly strapped on the iron box and looked up to see Fu Jin crashing into the room. The force made sparks fly from the door hinges, and an old man behind him stepped quickly, shattering the cracks in the blue bricks underfoot.

"Are you Xu Yunfan?"

"I am. May I ask who you are..."

Xu Yunfan looked at Fu Jin.

Fu Jin introduced him, "This is the Master of the Casting Hall of the Sky Crafting Cave, Zhan Yan..."

He lowered his voice slightly, "He is an elder who came out of the Divine Weapon Ridge back in the day, Zhan Yan."

Xu Yunfan straightened his expression and cupped his fists. "Master Zhan!"

He couldn't see through the man's strength; he was at least a Flesh Refining Realm expert. His hands were particularly wide and thick like cattail fans, and the muscle curves of his arms were astonishing.

Zhan Yan waved his hand dismissively and stepped forward immediately. The moment his palm, covered in burn scars, clamped down on Xu Yunfan’s shoulder.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes flashed. His whole body’s muscles tensed subconsciously. As his blood and energy surged beneath his skin, strands of golden threads lit up within his muscles. A strange golden luster flowed over his skin.

*Crack!*

The copper mirror in the guest room shattered instantly. The fragments reflected the excitement dancing in the old man’s pupils.

Zhan Yan’s expression changed from a hint of urgency to one of wide-eyed shock.

"Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Pattern?"

"Golden Skin State?! You’ve perfected the Red Forged Copper Body?!"

"What?!"

Fu Jin also cried out, his face filled with disbelief. Yesterday, he had thought Xu Yunfan was a Three-Forge Martial Teacher who practiced the Divine Weapon Ridge’s martial arts. Out of nostalgia, he naturally wanted to see if he could offer some help, so he went back and intentionally exaggerated Xu Yunfan’s talent to get Zhan Yan to come take a look.

He didn't expect he had still been too conservative.

When Zhan Yan learned that Xu Yunfan had a connection with Lu Yi and took out the token Lu Yi had given him from his chest, his doubts vanished. He relaxed and sighed, "It's that kid. He used to pull the bellows in my courtyard, and I scolded him well."

He suddenly stopped. His thumb scraped against the edge of Lu Yi’s Dark Iron Token, producing a harsh, grating sound. The ice-crack pattern on the edge was an anti-counterfeiting mark he had personally hammered out back then.

"That kid... is he still alive..."

Zhan Yan’s Adam's apple rolled like a muffled thunder. His bloodshot eyes stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan.

"Since you have no master, are you willing to take me as your master at the Sky Crafting Cave?"

Xu Yunfan’s expression shifted. Zhan Yan saw this and said directly, "Although the Divine Weapon Ridge was smashed and the lineage was broken back then, my lineage has been passed down. The advanced martial art of the Red Forged Copper Body and the Heavy Hammer Style is the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method. It includes the玄 Steel Hundred-Forge Hard Body and the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength, allowing you to cultivate straight to the Marrow Washing Realm!"

"Even throughout the sixteen states of the Northern Yan Dao, no one dares to say they are number one when it comes to the hammer methods of the Divine Weapon Ridge!"

Xu Yunfan immediately dropped to his knees in a kowtow. The blue bricks beneath his knees shattered with a bang, fragments of stone flying out like arrows. He knocked his head against the ground, three loud kowtows that sent fragments of blue stone scattering everywhere.

"Master, please accept your disciple's bow!"

Watching Xu Yunfan kowtow without hesitation, Zhan Yan couldn't help but smile. He happily helped Xu Yunfan up.

"Good, good, good!" Zhan Yan’s massive hands gripped Xu Yunfan’s shoulders. His bushy beard seemed to crackle with thunderous laughter. "A Red Forged Copper Body in the Golden Skin State—even the armor-piercing drills of Northern Yan Dao can't pierce it. It is fitting that my Casting Hall rises to prominence!"

Having cultivated the Red Forged Copper Body and Heavy Hammer Style to the Great Perfection realm and manifesting the Golden Skin State, throughout the entire Northern Yan Dao, the number of young people who could cultivate one of the sinews, bones, or skin to the Great Perfection realm could be counted on two hands.

Fu Jin stood by, tears streaming down his old face. He hugged Zhan Yan’s arm and wailed loudly.

"Master, the Divine Weapon Ridge finally has a successor."

"Get lost." Zhan Yan甩开 Fu Jin, his beard bristling. "You can't even remember the banner of the Sky Crafting Cave's Casting Hall? If someone hears it, I'll cut your tongue out."

Fu Jin stood to the side, wiping his eyes, his mouth tightly shut.
