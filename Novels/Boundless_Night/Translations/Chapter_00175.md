Chapter 175: Rebirth as a Butterfly

A bright moon hung high, casting its pure light, covering mountains and filling ravines, dyeing the entire forest a faint silvery white.

Qin Ming was dazed. Was he hallucinating in his dying moments?

This definitely wasn't a moonworm hovering; it was far brighter than the strange worm from Black and White Mountain.

Night mist swirled, but it wasn't too dense. Moonlight, like water, poured down, making the mountain wilderness seem to rise with a thin layer of smoke, possessing a simple, ethereal beauty.

"I'm about to die, what mood do I have to admire the scenery?" Qin Ming struggled to get up, loosening the parachute pack on his body. Yet, he couldn't help but want to examine this world closely.

For someone living in a perpetually dark world, seeing the moon was truly rare!

He leaned against an old tree, the intense pain throughout his body gradually numbing until he couldn't feel it anymore. This was not a good sign; it meant his life might be counting down.

This was a mountainous area, bathed in moonlight, with towering trees, wisteria bearing purple buds, and small trees laden with red fruits. The chirping of insects nearby was pleasant to the ear, yet only added to the serene tranquility.

"In my current state, I might eventually be eaten by wild beasts. Is it my turn to be 'stomach-buried'?" Qin Ming muttered to himself.

At the same time, he felt his speech becoming slurred, his body increasingly disobedient.

He carefully observed his internal organs: they had completely ceased functioning, filled with cracks. There was no heartbeat, no breathing. He was now a living corpse.

However, Qin Ming refused to simply wait for death.

"I have many unfulfilled wishes; I cannot die like this. That scoundrel Cao Qianqiu, hated by gods, humans, and ghosts alike, is living more vibrantly than ever. I am so young, no worse than any ancestor in their youth; I cannot die young."

He encouraged himself, rallying his spirit, activating the Fate Altering Scripture, then practicing the Jade Radiance Force. He tried every cultivation method that could nourish the body.

"I want to forge a path for the newcomers; they have it too difficult. But... perhaps that's too grand a statement; a small newcomer like me isn't worthy yet. Hmm, I still have a bunch of opponents waiting for me to crush. Let's change one more wish: I haven't found my grandfather yet. Back then, only the two of us relied on each other, so lonely. I want to marry and have children, to let him experience the happiness of being a great-grandfather. Oh, and I've even seen the moon, so I must see the sun too!"

Qin Ming's will to survive was at its peak. He didn't want to die, desperately setting up various aspirations for himself!

In the end, he tried every secret technique except for the dominant Purple Palace Thunderfire, which he dared not activate.

One of them actually had some effect: the gentle and spirit-nourishing "Greenwood Scripture". Perhaps the environment here was very suitable for it.

Nearby, lush greenery abounded, with trees everywhere. The entire mountain wilderness was vibrant with life.

In an instant, Qin Ming was engulfed by the rich Greenwood Qi. The fragrant wild flowers, the scent of grass, mixed with the smell of earth, flowed and rippled here, full of fresh vitality.

However, this was only effective at first.

Later, no matter how much effort he put in, his physical condition continued to deteriorate to a terrible state.

At this point, his heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs had completely shut down. Not even the faintest ripple remained from before; all his internal organs had fallen silent.

Had his body died? Qin Ming felt somewhat dejected. Ultimately, he couldn't escape this calamity. He had truly exhausted all his methods; there was nothing else he could do.

Although he was not a disciple of the Immortal Path, nor a divine seed of the Esoteric Sect, he was a leader on the path of ordinary people. Yet, he still found it difficult to change his fate.

Under the moonlight, Qin Ming leaned against the old tree, sighing, resigned. All his sharpness had vanished.

He saw the bright red wild fruits on a nearby tree and realized he hadn't eaten in a long time. However, thinking of his ruptured, defunct stomach, he averted his gaze.

He wasn't afraid of death, merely regretted his life. Gradually, he calmed his mind and quietly observed the surrounding scenery.

Beside him was a lake where, occasionally, five-colored dragon carp would leap, breaking the mirror-like surface of the lake, shattering the moon's reflection. The water shimmered, and wisps of lake mist intertwined with the moonlight, appearing very ethereal, mysterious, and somewhat elegantly transcendent.

"To be buried here, the scenery isn't bad." Although he said this, he seemed a little forlorn.

Pure white thin mist swirled through the forest. Qin Ming looked up at the night sky. Was that a real moon?

"Could it be that I've fallen into some creature's divine realm?" Qin Ming had some doubts.

In the Night Mist World, masters abound. Old seniors possess vast divine powers, and some path-forgers might even still be alive. If a bright moon hung in the sky, how could it escape their notice?

Soon, he dismissed his suspicion. This certainly wasn't the domain of demigod-like creatures deep within the mysterious black mist.

Because, as far as he knew, his physical body shouldn't be able to enter such a place.

Qin Ming introspected again, discovering that his patched-up body, though completely shut down, hadn't necrotized. This was beyond his expectation.

He carefully scanned every inch of his flesh and blood. He believed the main reason his body hadn't died was its incredibly solid foundation; even though it had been torn into many pieces, it still retained strong vitality.

Additionally, the "land" he cultivated among the clouds, from which he collected purple mist, golden light, silver radiance, and the like, also played a role, moisturizing his flesh and internal organs as if secret medicine had entered his body.

Moreover, the Greenwood Qi he had just drawn from the entire forest also somewhat 'preserved' his flesh and blood.

But none of these were long-term solutions. As time passed, even his thickest foundation wouldn't hold up. Being stronger than previous ancestors at his age was useless; he would eventually be depleted.

"Perhaps, only rebirth can save my life, allowing my flesh and blood to regain vitality!" Qin Ming stared at the dreamlike blue liquid, which he had preserved and bound outside his body using Cohesion Force.

However, his body's problems were extremely severe; rebirth would likely be difficult.

Furthermore, if one's body wasn't in its optimal state, consuming minerals could actually harm it.

"I'm about to die, what more is there to consider?" Qin Ming decided to risk it all.

He had no retreat; his only path was forward!

In an instant, he activated Skyglow Force, sending all the blue liquid into his flesh and blood.

Now, he couldn't absorb it orally.

His body was largely unresponsive. Fortunately, his Skyglow Force was special, fused with divine wisdom and consciousness radiance, allowing him to still use it.

Throughout Qin Ming's entire body, including his torn heart, lungs, and kidneys, wisps of blue mist flowed through.

"The path of ordinary people relies on bodily mutation to advance. The ancient sages who forged this path succeeded in their transformations only by consuming special herbs while on the verge of death during their battles with colossal beasts. They walked forward vigorously, leaving bloody footprints with every step. I can do it too!"

He firmed his resolve, encouraging himself.

In a flash, his Skyglow Force circulated throughout his body.

If he failed today, he would die here.

As expected, consuming the minerals when not in optimal condition indeed caused considerable damage to his body; Qin Ming even bled from his seven orifices.

He had no blood left to bleed, but now, after his entire body was 'invaded' by the dreamlike blue liquid, it subtly vibrated, attempting to draw forth his latent potential for rebirth.

This led to severe consequences. His body, originally pieced together like cracked porcelain, was now on the verge of breaking apart again.

If something went wrong, this place would become a scene of scattered flesh and blood fragments.

Clearly, he was different from the path-forging sages of old; his body, in others' eyes, had long since died and was utterly incapable of rebirth.

Now, what other method could he use to prolong his life?

At the brink of life and death, Qin Ming maintained his physical body from shattering. After enduring the fierce changes brought about by consuming the minerals, he chose the Fate Altering Scripture.

This scripture originated from the depths of the Night Mist World, imbued with a mysterious aura, and was being studied by those outside the conventional paths.

Now, he began to activate this scripture.

The Fate Altering Scripture was remarkably mystical, allowing Skyglow Force, divine wisdom, and the light of the soul to operate simultaneously.

At this moment, the three powers merged into one, flowing like golden rivers through his decaying flesh and blood.

Qin Ming was covered in cracks, in an extremely terrible state, as if shrouded in black mist. Not only different parts of his body, but even the interiors of organs like his heart and kidneys, were cut and divided into multiple regions by fissures.

As he activated the Fate Altering Scripture, advancing along a mysterious network, golden rivers traversed the cold, fractured lands shrouded in night mist, gradually dispelling the darkness.

This was like pioneering new land: golden rivers spread out, irrigating the black mist, waiting for the earth to revive. Skyglow, divine wisdom, and the light of the soul merged, like 'yang seeds' buried in the 'yin soil' of his flesh and blood.

Qin Ming was full of hope, waiting for the heavily misted flesh-and-blood soil to once again radiate light, dispelling all death qi.

However, in the end, all the golden rivers delved deep into the 'yin soil', flowing until they were depleted and completely dried up. His spiritual consciousness also sank into the various pockets of flesh-and-blood soil, yet still failed to bring about bodily rebirth.

At this moment, Qin Ming's consciousness sank with it. He was bewildered. Trapped in the black mist, unable to break free, was he going to die along with his physical body?

Had all his efforts been in vain? A myriad of helplessness and powerlessness surged into his heart. His dimming consciousness let out a sigh: even the Fate Altering Scripture couldn't change his fate.

"In this era, myriad laws flourish, all paths advance side-by-side. The Great Reclamation and Great Opening are imminent. The boundless depths of the Night Mist World hold endless mysteries. Those near-immortal seeds and divine seeds might, because of this, have hope of becoming gods and ancestors. I don't want to miss it, I'm unwilling! I want to forge a path for ordinary people, for the newcomers!"

Accompanying Qin Ming's final sigh, he fell silent. The Fate Altering Scripture ceased its operation, and the golden rivers seeped into the black-misted flesh-and-blood earth, never to reappear. He completely lost all conscious fluctuations.

His body became still, filled with a deathly stillness.

Anyone who came here and saw him in this state would be certain that he had lost his life; his flesh, blood, and spirit had all fallen silent. He was truly dead.

In the night sky, a rainbow light streaked across the bright moon, but it couldn't travel far from it. After circling the moon, it quickly dissipated, and the night sky grew cold and silent.

On the ground, within the motionless Qin Ming's flesh-and-blood soil, black mist surged. The 'yang seeds' planted by the Fate Altering Scripture were powerless, unable to take root and sprout.

Now, they were controlled by another scripture, spontaneously emerging. The golden rivers returned to the surface, interweaving across the black mist.

Soon after, golden threads appeared within Qin Ming's body, interweaving to stitch up his tattered form. Silver light steamed, applying itself between his torn flesh and broken internal organs.

Finally, after he had fallen into complete despair, the Silk Scroll Art activated!

At this moment, golden needles threaded across Qin Ming's body, as if mending him thousands, tens of thousands of times. The silver light transformed, astonishingly turning into jade light, reapplying the 'medicine' and emitting a faint medicinal fragrance.

Only at this moment, after the silver light had fully transformed into a jade color, could it perhaps be considered a true "Golden Threads Jade Garment".

Even with such an unusual phenomenon, Qin Ming remained silent and still. His condition was at its absolute worst!

He could be seen as if cocooned, for even the Golden Threads Jade Garment had dimmed. Bound to his body, he remained utterly motionless.

It was unknown how long passed before a portion of Qin Ming's consciousness revived, illuminating parts of his body, then bursting forth from the cocoon of flesh.

He was bewildered: Who was he? Where was this place?

Then, he lowered his gaze and saw a body covered in blood clots, deathly still, as if trapped within a cocoon.

At this moment, he saw several butterflies dancing in the forest under the moonlight.

His spiritual consciousness also imitated them, dancing like a butterfly, following along.

"No, I'm not them. Who am I?" He stopped again, flying back closer to his body.

"Have I been reborn as a butterfly? No, I am Qin Ming, I cannot die!" Fragmented memories appeared. Although he was only a partial consciousness, he still recalled many things.

This was just a part of his consciousness, but he knew that if he left his physical body and departed, his flesh and blood, along with his dormant main consciousness within, would completely die.

In an instant, he returned to his physical body.

This fragmented consciousness, fused with divine wisdom and Skyglow Force, was not fragile. He vibrated with all his might, burning, to awaken his main consciousness.

Gradually, the long-dormant main consciousness began to glow, emitting a faint radiance, and the Golden Threads Jade Garment also regained a faint luster.

"I must wake up! I am not a butterfly, I am a path-forging ancestor!" Qin Ming's wisp of fragmented consciousness roared, stirring up layers of ripples within his main consciousness. Then, it transformed into a fiery blaze, beginning to burn fiercely, until his entire main consciousness became dazzling, and he fully awoke.
