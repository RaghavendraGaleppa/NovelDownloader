# Chapter 2: The Fire Spring

The Fire Spring was surrounded by rocks, mist and haze steaming up, appearing particularly bright in a world perpetually shrouded in night.

Qin Ming squatted down and fished out a glowing stone from the pond. It was more lustrous than red coral, radiating iridescent light in all directions.

The Sun Stones used by every household originated from the Fire Spring. After their glow faded, they could be returned to the spring and would regain their light after a period of time.

The pond was filled with a fiery red glow that shone like magma, yet its temperature was far lower than that of the human body. The pond surface shimmered with dancing firelight. It was neither true fire nor spring water, but a highly unique substance.

Now, with no daylight, perpetual night reigned, differentiated only into shallow night and deep night. In such an era, the Fire Spring was exceptionally important. All crops, be they the mutated grain Silver Wheat or common ones like earth potatoes, needed the Fire Spring's irrigation to grow. Moreover, prolonged absence from the Fire Spring could cause discomfort to people. It could be said that it was the very foundation of people's survival.

Even in this world without daylight, seasons could still be discerned. Spring and summer were the Fire Spring's active periods, during which it gurgled forth abundantly, meeting the needs of cultivation. Winter was its dormant period. For instance, here in Twin Tree Village, while the pond still glowed, it could only be used to nourish Sun Stones for lighting. All in all, in an age without daylight, people lived by "chasing fire."

The Fire Spring, being so conspicuous in the dark, naturally drew the covetous gaze of various creatures. Fortunately, each had its own territory, maintaining a certain balance most of the time. Twin Tree Village suffered from food shortages, primarily because it had been raided by strange birds during harvest. Their beaks, like scythes, would strip several clumps of wheat bare with a single peck. Additionally, an ant plague and certain human factors contributed to people nearly starving to death during the winter.

It was currently shallow night, the darkness relatively faint. Occasionally, "earth light" would rise in the distance, making the vague outline of the dense forest faintly visible. But in deep night, nothing at all was visible; everything fell silent, and the darkness was terrifyingly profound.

Qin Ming pondered when he could go out to resolve the severe food shortage. He gazed out at the wilderness; it was very dark, and distant sights were invisible. The accumulated snow already reached chest height, making the living conditions quite harsh.

At the village entrance, the Fire Spring illuminated a bright area. A cold wind swept past, and within the six-foot square fire pool, the surface rippled with light. The black and white twin trees in the pond rustled, shaking down accumulated snowflakes that sparkled brilliantly in the fire's glow. The leaves of the two trees had a slightly jade-like texture and defied the bitter cold, but apart from repelling mosquitoes in summer, they served no significant purpose. Qin Ming felt the cold snowflakes falling from the trees onto his neck and came back to his senses. No matter what, he needed to recuperate his body a bit more; it was too dangerous outside.

He walked back along the original path, the lights of the various houses flickering. Behind him, the wilderness was utterly dark, everything withered, like a giant beast poised to swallow all.

Qin Ming stood in the courtyard, performing various specific exercises with remarkable skill and fluidity. Having done this for years, it had almost become an instinct. After a long time, sweat beaded on his forehead, and warmth spread through his body. Only then did he stop.

He entered his room and retrieved a miniature crystal bottle, only thumb-length. It was delicately carved, transparent, and exquisite, containing a blue liquid with ice crystals. He carefully held it up, examining it against the fiery glow emanating from the Sun Stone. Two characters were engraved on the delicate bottle: "Mineral Essence." The liquid inside was intoxicatingly blue; when gently shaken, a blue mist flowed within the bottle, creating a dreamlike sensation.

Qin Ming restrained his impulse and did not open the small bottle. He was just recovering from a severe illness, and using the blue liquid at this time would do more harm than good. He had unexpectedly obtained this in a dangerous area in the mountains. Before this, he had only heard of "Mineral Essence" and had never actually come into contact with such a precious substance. Used when the body was in its optimal state, it could improve one's constitution and invigorate the spirit. He had fallen gravely ill after escaping the mountains and hadn't had a chance to try it.

"Perhaps I'll be able to use it in a few more days," Qin Ming mused, putting away the exquisitely crafted crystal bottle.

A cold wind swept by, and sporadic snowflakes drifted down. Qin Ming lived alone, and his quiet courtyard felt desolate, almost bleak. He had grown used to it.

As time passed, the night deepened, and shallow night was drawing to a close.

Lu Ze arrived, accompanied by a boy of about five. Although the boy was bundled up tightly, his small face was red from the cold.

"Wen Rui has grown a bit taller again," Qin Ming remarked, gesturing to the boy's height.

"Uncle, are you feeling better?" Lu Wenrui asked, looking up with concern. His eyes were large and clear, typical of a pure and adorable child his age.

Qin Ming smiled in response, "I'm fine now. In a few days, Uncle will catch that 'Talking Sparrow' you've been longing for."

"A Talking Sparrow that can talk to people, really? That's wonderful!" Little Wenrui exclaimed, exceptionally happy, his eyes sparkling with delight.

"Things outside aren't right recently," Lu Ze said, handing a food box to Qin Ming and telling him not to rush outside.

Although the rock rice was relatively coarse and tough in texture, Qin Ming's mouth still watered. With only two meals a day, he was truly hungry. To his surprise, there were even a few red dates in the rock rice, extraordinarily soft, smooth, delicate, sweet, and delicious. Qin Ming noticed Little Wenrui staring intently and swallowing. Feeling guilty, he squatted down and asked, "Wen Rui, tell Uncle, are you still hungry?"

Lu Ze shook his head and said, "That's not it. He must be reacting to the red dates."

Qin Ming immediately picked out a few red dates and offered them to the handsome, guileless little boy. Lu Ze stopped him, saying, "Your sister-in-law specifically put these in for you to replenish your qi and blood. Don't give them to him."

Just then, Liang Wanqing also arrived. She looked at Wen Rui and said, "Your Uncle Qin is weak. We have no meat or tonics now, so don't be greedy." She wasn't bad-hearted. Earlier, she had believed Qin Ming wouldn't survive, like the other three villagers, and that helping him would be futile, which was why she had argued with her husband. Now, seeing him begin to recover and no longer dazed, Liang Wanqing, despite knowing her family's food reserves were nearly depleted, still felt compelled to help.

Little Wenrui obediently nodded, blinking his large eyes, and said, "Uncle, eat quickly and get better soon. I'm not hungry anymore."

How could Qin Ming possibly eat? He insisted on feeding the dates to Little Wenrui, feeling a pang of discomfort. He knew he absolutely had to venture into the dense forest soon. He was very grateful to the couple but didn't utter many polite words, merely inquiring about the situation outside. Liang Wanqing sat and chatted for a while before returning home, as she had another child over two years old to care for.

"Recently, huge creatures have been appearing in the dense forest, and some people have died or been injured..." Lu Ze told him, emphasizing that he couldn't act alone now as it was extremely dangerous outside. Qin Ming nodded, listening intently.

He wasn't sure if it was due to rampant blizzards making it difficult for mountain beasts to forage, or for other reasons, but there was a great deal of activity in the wilderness. Especially in the area where Qin Ming contracted his strange illness, there had once been pupils brighter than Sun Stones piercing through the mountain's darkness, causing the dense forest to fall instantly silent. Hearing this, Qin Ming inevitably recalled his dangerous experience from a month ago.

That day, in the pitch-black mountain forest, he and three companions suddenly stepped into emptiness, plummeting into a crevice in the ground. The underground was quite abnormal; after extreme darkness, there was a blinding light that made their eyes sting and tears stream down. What disturbed him most was his heart beginning to beat excessively, like violently pounding drums, the powerful thumping even audible outside his chest. Recalling this, he still felt a lingering fear. At that moment, he was paralyzed, blood rushing through his body, and in a daze, he heard the sound of a waterfall. Qin Ming thought he would die, that his heart would explode.

Soon, the depths of the crevice became less dazzling. He saw silver lights, one after another, like silkworm threads or spiderwebs, interwoven, causing his consciousness to become muddled and his sense of space to disappear. At that time, Qin Ming felt dizzy and lightheaded, while his companions had fainted. It wasn't until the silver light suddenly vanished and complete darkness enveloped them that Qin Ming's heartbeat gradually returned to normal, and he regained control of his body. He then successively carried his three companions out of the crevice, and it took a long time for them to regain consciousness.

During this process, Qin Ming also discovered several well-dressed corpses not far from the crevice, who had probably died not long ago. Following the simple principle of not wasting, he quickly checked them, and that's when he picked up the small crystal bottle containing the blue liquid. Qin Ming hadn't mentioned the small bottle to Lu Ze, fearing trouble, as the deceased individuals clearly seemed to be people of standing. The mountains were full of fierce beasts; he presumed nothing would be left there, and all traces would be erased.

On their way back to the village, Qin Ming and his companions gradually began to feel unwell, staggering as they walked, their consciousness growing hazy. The three companions died the very day they returned, their entire bodies turning black. Only Qin Ming endured for a month before finally recovering.

After eating the rock rice, Qin Ming and Lu Ze talked for a long time. Wen Rui was very sensible, listening quietly by their side. Afterwards, the atmosphere relaxed. Qin Ming looked at the slightly shy boy and said, "Wen Rui, when Uncle gets better, I'll let you eat your fill of dates, hazelnuts, whatever you want."

"Will there be meat? I... haven't eaten it in a long time," Little Wenrui whispered, unable to stop himself from swallowing again, as if recalling a taste from the past. His flushed little face was filled with hope.

"There will be!" Qin Ming said, dotingly patting his head.

As night deepened, Lu Ze rose and left with Wen Rui.

Inside the room, the flame-like glow emitted by the Sun Stone in the bronze basin dimmed. Qin Ming sat quietly with his eyes closed, mentally forming his own image, practicing various specific movements, engaging in consciousness cultivation, until finally emptying his mind. The moment he opened his eyes, he vaguely saw a faint silver light flash and vanish.

"Was that an illusion?" Qin Ming was startled. Although it was just a fleeting glimpse, he believed he hadn't been mistaken; indeed, faint silver ripples dissipated from his body surface, vanishing in an instant. He had persisted in this special training method for many years, yet there had never been any "movement" or progress. Today, however, an anomaly appeared!

Qin Ming found a layer of fine sweat on his body, as if he had undergone intense exercise, yet he felt full of vigor. He went to the courtyard, his eyes gleaming, and performed those sets of specific movements with his body. He was completely engrossed. Soon, his body began to heat up, and a vibrant surge of vitality expanded within him, like a parched desert receiving a light rain.

Long after, Qin Ming was drenched in sweat, white mist rising from his head. He felt extremely comfortable all over, as if the last remnants of his illness had been expelled with the profuse perspiration. When he finally felt tired and stopped this special training, he clearly saw an extremely faint silver light emerging from his body surface, then rapidly dissipating.

"It's really different now," he thought, seeing it clearly this time. Qin Ming felt a sense of exhilaration, and a real warmth flowed within his body, slowly nourishing him. His vitality, spirit, and energy grew increasingly abundant.

After a short rest, he still wanted to practice those specific movements, but his stomach rumbled, and hunger emerged, even though he had already eaten dinner. Qin Ming immediately stopped, not daring to consume more physical strength. He couldn't possibly face Lu Ze to ask for more food again. He was soaked all over, his clothes thoroughly drenched with sweat. He went to heat water to wash up.

Qin Ming looked at his clear, handsome face reflected in the basin. It was no longer pale but had regained color. He muttered to himself, "I've mostly recovered. I'll set off tomorrow morning." He didn't want to trouble others or become a burden. Once he could act, he wanted to solve the food problem as soon as possible and escape his current predicament.

Qin Ming returned the extinguished Sun Stone to the Fire Spring. When he came back, he only took a small piece to light his way. The lights in each house gradually dimmed one after another, and the entire village merged into the darkness.

"So hungry!" It wasn't even time to sleep yet, but Qin Ming was unbearably hungry. His stomach felt like it was on fire. Forget about delicacies; he would devour an earth rat if it appeared before him. Unfortunately, in such times, even the mouse holes in the village were desolate. Qin Ming tried to hypnotize himself into early sleep, but he was so hungry his heart pounded with unease, making it impossible to fall asleep.

He forced himself to divert his attention, to think about beautiful people and things, such as the few blurry faces in his mind. Then he thought of his special training method; it was truly different now, even showing "movement." Extremely faint silver ripples had once appeared on his body surface, making him quite expectant of what further changes might come. Then his thoughts drifted, recalling the fresh, sweet berries hidden under the snow and ice in the dense forest, and golden-brown, glistening lamb legs roasted over a bonfire.

"Crossing the line! How can I think of such things!" He quickly pinched himself. He decided to set off when shallow night arrived. It was all to quickly fulfill Little Wenrui's wish. Then he couldn't help but swallow.

Accompanied by his longing and yearning for food, Qin Ming finally slowly fell asleep.
