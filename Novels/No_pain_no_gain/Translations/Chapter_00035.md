**Chapter 35: Seeing Han Li Again**

The small needle only glowed with a faint dark light, and under Han Zhen's Object Manipulation spell, it appeared almost instantaneously on the other side of the room. Moreover, Han Zhen could feel an unhindered connection with the spiritual tool. After testing it, Han Zhen was very satisfied with this tool. Besides countering moves, fighting primarily relied on surprise.

As Shopkeeper Tian introduced each one, after looking through all eight brocade boxes, Han Zhen was interested in acquiring the Cold Nether Needle and two other top-tier spiritual tools, one for offense and one for defense. Three spiritual tools were almost the limit that a Qi Condensation cultivator could control simultaneously.

Shopkeeper Tian watched Han Zhen's conflicted expression, then took a sip of tea and asked with a smile, "How is it, Fellow Daoist Han? Which spiritual tool do you intend to buy?"

Hearing this, Han Zhen stopped hesitating. Running to more shops might not yield anything better, and there was even the risk of exposing his wealth. After all, not every merchant association valued reputation as much as the Ten Thousand Treasure Pavilion.

"I'm quite interested in all three of these; I plan to buy them all!"

"Three?" Shopkeeper Tian said, somewhat surprised. After all, he had a rough idea of Han Zhen's wealth. Even after deducting the cost of talismans, buying one spiritual tool was almost the limit.

Seeing this, Han Zhen smiled faintly, took out two brocade boxes from his storage pouch, and opened them before Shopkeeper Tian. They were astonishingly ten talismans each, full of spiritual energy, clearly not ordinary items. These were, of course, the fruits of Han Zhen's cultivation of two new talisman arts after purchasing the Golden Bamboo Brush from Han Yunzhi several months ago: the Elementary High-grade Spiritual Talisman, Thorny Talisman, and the Elementary High-grade Spiritual Talisman, Fire Cloud Talisman.

"Using these to purchase three spiritual tools, I wonder if it's enough?"

Top-tier spiritual tools typically fetched around four hundred spirit stones at auctions. Even if the finest among top-tier tools were more expensive, the value of Han Zhen's ten talismans slightly exceeded one thousand spirit stones, requiring at most a small supplementary payment.

Shopkeeper Tian was both surprised and delighted, hastily checking the quality of the ten talismans. After confirming that they were all indeed Elementary High-grade offensive spiritual talismans, he began to doubt whether Han Zhen's friend truly existed. After all, cultivating talisman arts to the Elementary High-grade level in just one year was far too rare. Han Zhen was naturally happy that Shopkeeper Tian entertained such doubts.

After a moment of hesitation, Shopkeeper Tian decisively agreed to the transaction: "It will be as Fellow Daoist Han says. As for this small difference in price..." As Shopkeeper Tian spoke, he took out an exquisite token from his storage pouch, bearing the insignia of the Ten Thousand Treasure Pavilion. "I hope Fellow Daoist Han can agree to a small request from this Tian. In the future, whether in Tainan Valley or elsewhere, I hope Fellow Daoist Han will prioritize our establishment. As for this token, Fellow Daoist Han will receive certain preferential treatment at any Ten Thousand Treasure Pavilion location!"

Han Zhen nodded, smiling contentedly, and accepted Shopkeeper Tian's token. Those who could run such a large merchant association were truly shrewd, understanding that long-term cooperation yielded greater benefits than depleting resources. Thus, both Han Zhen and Shopkeeper Tian achieved satisfactory outcomes, and both parties were delighted.

Upon returning to his pavilion, Han Zhen immediately took out the three newly acquired top-tier spiritual tools and began to master them. Aside from the Cold Nether Needle, the other two top-tier spiritual tools were a wood-attribute flying sword—the Wood Elemental Sword—and a small blue shield. Combined with the basic wood-attribute cultivation method Han Zhen practiced, the Wood Elemental Sword could perfectly unleash its power. The shield, when activated, would automatically revolve around his body, actively defending against attacks from all directions. It was particularly effective against fire-attribute spells and spiritual tools.

In the following time, besides cultivating talisman crafting, Han Zhen would occasionally secretly go outside Tainan Valley to familiarize himself with the three spiritual tools he had acquired. By now, he could control them as if they were extensions of his limbs. Unfortunately, since Qing Wen left the valley, he had not reappeared in these past few months, dashing Han Zhen's idea of blood-refining the sword.

As more and more rogue cultivators gathered within Tainan Valley, the Tainan Small Gathering's trade fair was convened as scheduled. At this time, in a grove at the foot of Mount Tainan, a young man with an ordinary appearance was cautiously walking towards the northern side of the mountain foot. This was precisely Han Li, who had resolved the Mo Mansion crisis in Jiayuan City. Although not compelled by the Cold Poison, he still chose to settle this karmic debt.

After observing for a moment outside the valley and confirming no one was around, Han Li emerged from behind a large tree and came to the front of the hillside. He quickly took out a talisman paper from his robes, which then transformed into a fiery light, rushing into the mist and disappearing. Although he had gained some understanding of Tainan Valley from the scattered words in Han Zhen's letter, seeing so many cultivators all at once still left Han Li somewhat dazed. He lightly shook his head to clear his mind. Anyone here could easily eliminate him. To avoid causing trouble for himself and Brother Zhen, he must be cautious and keep a low profile!

Han Li did not go directly to Han Zhen's pavilion. Instead, he approached the square where stalls were set up, but he didn't enter immediately. He stayed nearby, observing the cultivators coming and going. Han Zhen had mentioned in his letter that the Tainan Small Gathering was a trade fair specifically for junior cultivators, but these so-called juniors before him were all quite powerful. Among these people, he could only be considered of average skill. In just a short while, Han Li had seen five or six masters with strong spiritual energy, which made him feel greatly ashamed.

"Brother, why are you standing here alone? Are you waiting for a friend?" A clear voice suddenly came from behind Han Li, startling him.

Han Li slowly turned around to see five or six people standing not far behind him. The one speaking was a pale-faced Daoist, holding a whisk and smiling as he looked at Han Li. Han Li ignored the question. Just as he was about to ask something in return, he suddenly heard a familiar voice, filled with a hint of pleasant surprise.

"Little Li, you're here!"

Han Li instantly turned his head back, slightly stunned. It wasn't because of the change in Han Zhen's demeanor or appearance, but the dazzling, solid white light in his Dantian, which made it difficult for him to open his eyes. Standing behind Han Li was none other than Han Zhen, who had just come out of seclusion after learning that the Tainan Small Gathering had begun. At this moment, his cultivation was at the complete stage of Qi Condensation Layer Eleven!

Han Zhen stepped forward, standing between Han Li and Daoist Qing Wen, and greeted him, "Daoist Qing Wen, it truly has been a long time. I wonder how the Luo couple are doing?"

Han Zhen had naturally learned of Qing Wen's return to Tainan Valley, and also knew that the couple was not among the three who returned, which likely meant they had met a tragic end. Daoist Qing Wen's expression subtly changed upon hearing that name. He then replied with a somewhat pained tone, "Alas, it was all due to this humble Daoist's carelessness. I didn't expect that demon beast to be a pair. Fellow Daoist Luo perished along with his Daoist companion while trying to save them." Evidently, the people behind Daoist Qing Wen had only recently joined this group, and couldn't help but grow curious about this matter.
