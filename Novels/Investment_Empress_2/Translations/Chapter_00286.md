# Chapter 286: The Divine Monk and the Demoness: A Textbook Demonstration!

Mu Rongxiao took the sutra and casually flipped through it, looking somewhat confused. After asking Li Mo to inform his grandfather, Mu Rongyunhai, he waved goodbye.

"Brother Li, take care."
"Take care, Master Zang'ai."
"You damn..."

The farewell was filled with reluctance. Mu Rongxiao had a belly full of words but didn't know how to express them.

Li Mo smiled, returned to the Aquatic Clan's Heavenly Cave to pack up his kitchen utensils and such.

Ying Bing was still lost in thought, not even noticing Li Mo approaching. A tea leaf had fallen into her cup, but she paid it no mind, her soul seemingly flown off to who knows where.

"Ice Cube."

"Hm?"

"Let's go to the Marriage Tree again."

Ying Bing, who had been looking down, trembled slightly at his words and suddenly snapped back to reality.

"Why go back there?"

"I think I dropped something there last time."

Alright.

Little Li wanted to check if he could fulfill his wish before leaving. He didn't know when he'd see the Marriage Tree again, and the scene he saw in the Hundred Flavors Fruit yesterday had left him with a bit of PTSD.

"Let's go look for it, then."

Ying Bing patted the big-headed doll and nodded.

The two walked out of the Aquatic Clan's Heavenly Cave.

"By the way."

"Hm?"

"If a True Dragon and a True Phoenix were to combine, what do you think they would give birth to?"

Ying Bing had been walking gracefully and slowly, but she almost stumbled upon hearing this. When she regained her composure, she had already grabbed Li Mo's sleeve.

"Why are you asking that?"

"Well... just out of curiosity. It seems I've never heard of any descendants of a True Dragon and a True Phoenix." Li Mo pondered.

"That's because a True Dragon and a True Phoenix have never appeared at the same time."

The confused Little Li became even more confused.

After Ying Bing saw the Jade Phoenix Empress and combined it with her own knowledge, she spoke softly:

"It's because of the Power of All Living Beings. True Dragons and True Phoenixes are not creatures that existed from the very beginning. They were born in response to the times, thanks to the faith of the people."

"The Great Yu Dynasty still exists, and its national fortune has condensed into a Golden Dragon of Fortune. Thus, a True Phoenix has no basis to come into being."

"This is similar to the Divine Observation Method. Without the faith of the people, their power would continuously weaken."

After hearing the Ice Cube's explanation, Little Li fell into deep thought.

In the memories of the Fetal Veil Mystery, the mainstream theory is that dragons are also fictional creations.

They were born from different tribes, each with their own totemic beliefs, fighting and absorbing one another until they finally merged into one, becoming the totem of all the descendants of Yan and Huang.

Well, in his past life, there weren't so many mystical powers, let alone the Power of All Living Beings that he only has a partial understanding of now.

It might not be entirely the same thing.

Not long after, the two arrived under the Marriage Tree.

"Huh? Did I already fulfill my wish?"

Li Mo clearly remembered hanging his pouch in a specific spot, but now it was empty. He circled the tree a few times, but there was no sign of the pouch.

"Ice Cube, my pouch is gone. Do you have any idea what happened?"

"Maybe someone picked it up?"

Ying Bing quietly turned her head away.

"How uncivilized! What kind of scoundrel with a son born without an anus would do such a rotten thing?"

Little Li was furious.

*Squish—*

A sound suddenly came from his ear.

It was Ying Bing, expressionless, her delicate hand squeaking the big-headed doll as she squeezed it.

"It's okay, it's just a pouch. I'll hang ten or eight more of them later."

Little Li's anger instantly subsided.

Seeing that, his scalp went a little numb.

The feeling of empathy was just too direct...

They had already said their goodbyes to the Wu Qing couple, and Li Mo planned to leave the Southern Frontier with Ying Bing and return to the Clear Abyss Sect.

Their mount had gone back to its hometown.

Li Mo couldn't expect the Ice Cube to plan a route, so he asked for her map.

The two walked to a small pavilion not far from the Marriage Tree.

However, as soon as he spread out the map, he was stunned.

"Li Mo Village... Li Mo Mountain... Li Mo River... Li Mo Tribe..."

---

The map was quite accurate, but many places weren't labeled with names. This was normal; maps bought from the Prosperous Commerce Guild were the same. They couldn't possibly be detailed enough to record every small location.

But as everyone knows, the Ice Cube can't read a map.

An image involuntarily floated into Little Li's mind.

The cold and aloof Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan got lost. She took out her map to figure out her location, but looking at the map only made her more confused. She had no idea where she was.

So she picked up a pen...

"There are indeed these places."

Ying Bing took back the map, her clear and deep eyes looking very serious.

"Mhm, mhm, that's right."

Little Li nodded as he looked at the delicate hand still捏着 (niē zhe - pinching/squeezing) the big-headed doll.

Then he took out his own map and spread it out, planning their route home.

A while later.

Inside the pavilion, Li Mo rubbed his temples and was about to look into the distance when he saw two figures appear under the Marriage Tree not far away.

Ying Bing also followed his gaze.

Not far away was the Azure Luan Matriarch who would always smile brightly whenever she saw them.

Shang Qinqing.

She wasn't alone; beside her was a monk wearing a veil over his head. They were about fifteen zhang away from the pavilion.

A monk in seclusion?

Isn't that the Divine Monk, Huai Kong!

Shang Qinqing looked at the Divine Monk, her expression full of grievance.

*Sss...*

Little Li took a sharp breath of air, realizing this was no ordinary situation. He immediately held his breath and locked down his own vital energy.

A world-famous Divine Monk, being intimate with a female demon!

This was far more explosive than Old Xue searching for the Primordial Pill with a lantern. He wouldn't dare to sleep too soundly tonight.

Fortunately.

The Divine Monk and Shang Qinqing seemed to have their entire attention on each other and had no time to spare for anyone else.

"You're finally leaving."

"Benefactor, this monk does not know who you are..."

"Then you have the nerve to open your eyes and look at me."

"..."

Huai Kong let out a long sigh.

With his sigh, his eyes opened. The turbid gaze became clear, and his withered skin quickly regained its ruddy elasticity.

In an instant, he became a middle-aged monk.

"I knew it... otherwise, you wouldn't have put the Marriage Tree inside the temple."

Shang Qinqing gritted her teeth as she looked at him.

The Azure Luan symbolizes love.

The Marriage Tree is the same. To be precise, because the world's only pure-blooded Azure Luan met her fated one under this tree, this originally unremarkable tree gained its divine properties.

The Power of All Living Beings from the couples praying before the tree did more than just condense the Hundred Flavors Fruit.

This is also the reason why Shang Qinqing has retained part of her strength to this day, allowing the Azure Luan tribe to remain uninvolved in worldly affairs.

Huai Kong opened his mouth.

"If you lie, I'll push the tree down. I'll go be a Disaster Beast with Big Wind and Nine-Headed Bird."

"Don't do anything foolish..."

It wasn't clear where the other monks in the temple had gone; perhaps their abbot had assigned them extra chores.

Anyway, Shang Qinqing hugged the Divine Monk and started kissing him passionately.

If the monks had been there, they would have been terrified out of their wits. Their Divine Monk Abbot was being devoured by a demon! Was there no one to do anything about it?!

Li Mo leaned back tactically.

No wonder the Azure Luan Matriarch looked at him and the Ice Cube; she must have been starving and just wanted to feast her eyes.

See, the facts prove that you can't suppress yourself for too long. Someone like Brother Mu Rong is already plagued by delusions...

Ying Bing's clear, deep eyes reflected the scene not far away. She gently bit her lip.

She remembered that day.

When she took advantage of him being asleep and secretly...

Looking back now, that didn't seem like a real kiss at all...

The standard... is it supposed to be like this?

She turned her head, and her peripheral vision couldn't help but glance at the corner of his mouth.
