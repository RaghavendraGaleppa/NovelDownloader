# Chapter 281: Winning the Championship, Gaining a Beauty as a Companion, and the Poisonous Flower Taoist's Recruitment Offer from the Candle Cult?

Nangong Liuli, born of a noble and wealthy family, had exceptionally high and discerning standards. Ordinary men could not catch her eye, yet she had fallen into dire straits and faced grave danger. Seeing Li Xian display his might and defeat his enemies, his heroic and peerless demeanor possessed an indescribable charm, and she could not help but feel immense joy. Having already fallen into a pit of despair, she dared not ask for too much. Furthermore, the "Clear and Delicate Slumber Incense" stirred her thoughts, causing ripples in her eyes that refused to fade.

Bao Zhi贤, Ding Zelin, and Wang Changjiang had fallen from the stage, secretly lamenting the failure of their "Three-Angled Abdominal Snake Formation." They cupped their fists and said, "Brother Hua is formidable. The championship of this grand event is rightfully yours. We are convinced."

Li Xian smiled. "I have you all to thank for your concession. Brother Hua merely won by a fluke on the stage."

Shi Yufei and the others nodded and stroked their beards, feeling a measure of satisfaction. Their minds drifted to other matters. The world was gradually descending into chaos, with noble martial artists carving out their own territories. Yet, prodigies and rare treasures emerged one after another. First, the dragon's emergence from the water brought boundless excitement, and later, the sword sects discussed forming an alliance. In these turbulent and distant times, the Flower Cage Sect was but a single, isolated branch. It wished to taste the flavor of the chaotic world while also preserving itself. They thought even further back to the glory of their predecessor, the "Candle Cult," whose resounding prestige was still unforgettable.

As they lowered their eyes in contemplation, a cold laugh suddenly rang out: "Oh? Has the grand event ended?"

The voice was crisp, coming from a distance and echoing back and forth.

The voice spoke again: "I wish to see what prodigy or hero could so grievously injure my disciple." It was seductive and provocative. When the word "I" was spoken, it was still extremely distant, light and faint, as if carried by the wind. By the time the words "my disciple" were uttered, it had already缭绕 by their ears, like smoke blown into their faces, tickling their earlobes.

Suddenly, a bewitching woman in a purple dress was seen approaching from afar. Her steps were light, her figure graceful. She wore a light purple gauze dress, a slender waist adorned with golden threads, her bare feet touching the ground, and her toenails painted a faint red.

Full of charm, she spun around and sat atop the eaves of a pavilion, legs crossed. Her clothes were light and revealing, exposing her fair, white skin. Looking down from her high perch, she surveyed the scene with great interest.

This was none other than the Poisonous Flower Taoist... Hao Qingshe.

Then came the sound of whistling wind. Elder Meng Han of the Panzhi Tower rushed over from a distance. His lightness skill was superb; after a few graceful turns, he landed nearby and returned to his seat.

Ye Cheng frowned. "Meng Han, what trick are you playing? How did this woman get here? Did you summon her?"

Meng Han shrugged. "I don't know either. Brother Ye, you overestimate me. What ability do I have to summon her?" Ye Cheng was extremely suspicious. He flicked his sleeve in secret annoyance, guessing that Meng Han was up to something. He had a vague sense of foreboding and looked up at the woman on the eaves. Shi Yufei retracted his thoughts, Yan Hao's brows were tightly furrowed, and the sudden appearance of Hao Qingshe instantly made the atmosphere tense.

The truth was...

This unexpected turn of events was indeed Meng Han's doing. He was a narrow-minded man by nature and found it hard to let go of a grudge. Seeing Li Xian's initial display of brilliance, he remembered the matter of Li Xian using a token to advance his status and felt an immense sense of injustice.

He thought further: "This Hua Wucuo is detestable to the extreme, utterly lacking in sense. Such a person, even if he shows off a little now, will surely not go far in the future."

His peripheral vision caught Ye Cheng, and he suddenly had another thought: "Wait... this Hua Wucuo is Ye Cheng's man. Could it be that Ye Cheng is deliberately using this to give me, Meng Han, a下马威 (a show of strength)? If that's the case, how can I swallow this insult?"

Thinking of this, he felt even more angry. He suspected that since Ye Cheng was pulling the strings, any direct confrontation would be futile. So, he thought of another plan.

He heard Zeng Xiaoke's agonizing wails as she rolled on the ground, a truly miserable sight. A brilliant plan then formed in his mind. He knew well that there was an extremely unapproachable existence in the Water Altar. A person who was self-willed, unreasonable, ruthless, and skilled in the use of poison.

He rescued Zeng Xiaoke, applied his own homemade ointment to heal her skin, and brought her deep into the island to the secluded dwelling of the Poisonous Flower Taoist. With clever words, he lured Hao Qingshe out.

Hao Qingshe cast a cold glance, guessing that Meng Han had his own agenda. But seeing her beloved disciple in such a wretched state, she was extremely displeased. She also felt that her disciple's defeat had tarnished her own reputation. She had always looked down upon the Flower Cage Sect, so she came in person to observe the competition, intending to cause trouble, pick a fight, and even take a life.

Yan Hao frowned. "Miss Hao... you are late. This grand event has already concluded. This disciple, Hua Wucuo, has won."

Meng Han was slightly taken aback upon hearing this. In the short time he was away, the championship had fallen into Hua Wucuo's hands. But a glance at Hao Qingshe, whose eyes held a sharp glint, made him feel completely unconcerned. He thought, "Even if you are glorious now, it's just a flash in the pan."

Hao Qingshe said calmly, "Is that so... I think the timing is just right." As she spoke, a faint red snake slithered out from her hair. It was as thick as a little finger, its tongue flicking out, hiding a sharp edge.

Ye Cheng said, "Miss Hao, if you have something to say, please state it directly."

Li Xian felt a sense of unease, a vague sense of danger looming. While calming his mind, he also curiously thought, "These elders of the Flower Cage Sect call this woman 'Miss Hao'. That's a strange title. Aren't they from the same sect?"

Hao Qingshe said, "Xiaoke, come out."

Zeng Xiaoke was wrapped in white silk, her injuries severe. But even with medication and rest, her injuries could heal. Hao Qingshe said, "My disciple participated in your grand event. I have already shown you great respect. You lot, knowing no better, bullied her for being a woman and injured her so. You owe me an explanation."

Ye Cheng understood that Hao Qingshe's visit was aimed at Hua Wucuo. He thought, "This Hua Wucuo's temperament is indeed not suited for our Flower Cage Sect. But he is a rare talent. And this woman acts without restraint. If we don't stop her, it's hard to predict what will happen." A sense of appreciation for talent arose in him, and he said:

"In a擂台 (leitai) fight, casualties are unavoidable. To追究 (investigate) afterward would be somewhat inappropriate."

Hao Qingshe sneered. "Appropriate? With you flower thieves, there's no need to speak of appropriateness."

Yan Hao also said, "Your disciple participated in the event, and she herself killed several people. Do you not see others coming to hold her accountable?"

Hao Qingshe said, "My disciple inherits my mantle. If she couldn't even kill people, I would scold her instead. My disciple won fairly. Those who died, died. If anyone dares to追究, I'll just send them on their way. Isn't that simple?"

Yan Hao's face turned ashen. Ye Cheng said, "Your disciple is indeed formidable, but in a martial duel, the situation changes in an instant. Her victory was fair, and her defeat in this round was also fair."

Hao Qingshe said with a chilling smile, "I don't think so."

Ye Cheng said, "We all saw it with our own eyes. Are you implying that we were biased?"

Hao Qingshe said, "Elder Ye... you have a glib tongue. I'm not here to argue logic with you. To have defeated my disciple, he must have used some sinister method. I don't need to see it to be very clear about this. Even if you saw it, you wouldn't understand. In the art of poison, can you even compare to me?"

Ye Cheng's face twitched. With such sophistry, what more could be said? Hao Qingshe continued, "My dear disciple... you tell me, who used despicable means to injure you?" Zeng Xiaoke pointed at Li Xian and said, "Master, it was this villain. I was about to win, but he suddenly used a sneak attack. I beg you, Master, to punish him severely and seek justice for your disciple!"

Hao Qingshe said with great interest, "So it's you, little villain. Though you've won the championship, your deeds are exposed. You'll die a miserable death. Pitiful, pitiful."

Li Xian's brows furrowed tightly. Yan Hao said in a deep voice, "Hao Qingshe... don't you dare make trouble without reason. Our Flower Cage Sect organized this event, and this boy has already won the championship. If you kill him, won't we become a laughingstock?"

Hao Qingshe laughed. "You are already a laughingstock. Hahaha, I'm laughing just listening to it. What can you do about it?" With that, she waved her sleeve, and a cloud of faint blue poisonous mist drifted towards them.

Yan Hao's face turned ashen. Elders Liu Yu and the Ferry Envoy Jin Shichang... all remained silent, but they had strong opinions against Hao Qingshe.

Li Xian felt a great sense of danger. He knew Hao Qingshe came with fierce intent and would not allow him to speak. Facing a powerful enemy, though he felt危急 (dangerous), he forced himself to remain calm.

Seeing the poisonous mist drifting towards him, he thought of a way to escape. The mist seemed slow but was actually fast. Before he could devise a complete plan, it was already approaching. The immediate escape plan had to be put aside to focus on dealing with this move.

He spat out a cloud of blood mist, hoping to use blood fire to burn the poisonous mist. However, the mist was extremely cunning and swallowed the blood fire completely.

Hao Qingshe laughed. "So that's the move you used to burn my disciple's skin. It's useless against me.乖乖 (乖乖) and accept your death." She now understood that Zeng Xiaoke's loss was not unjust.

"This poisonous mist is called 'Bone-Corroding Heart and Brain Incense'. It corrodes flesh and blood, but it has a healing effect specifically on the heart and brain. It will corrode you clean, leaving only your heart and brain consciousness intact. Your consciousness will still be preserved. Then I will have some fun with you."

Shi Yufei stood up. "Qingshe, that's enough! Withdraw the mist."

Hao Qingshe played with the snake at her fingertips and said leisurely, "Great Envoy... you don't have the authority to command me."

Shi Yufei said, "Your disciple's injuries, I will take responsibility for. I quite like this boy. Give me some face."

Hao Qingshe's expression was distant, as if she hadn't heard a thing, implying, "Even if I don't give you face, what can you do about it?" Meng Han secretly thought, "Even the Great Envoy likes this boy. It seems my decision was right. If this boy lives, won't he become powerful in the future?"

He secretly felt得意 (pleased with himself).

Shi Yufei said, "You still won't back down?" He leaped, intending to pull Li Xian off the stage. Hao Qingshe waved her hand, and the speed of the poisonous mist suddenly increased, enveloping the stage a step before Shi Yufei could reach it.

Shi Yufei's expression changed drastically. Seeing the thick fog enveloping the stage, even he would find it difficult to break through. At this moment, Li Xian could not possibly survive. Though he felt regret, he was helpless.

Shi Yufei roared in anger, "Hao Qingshe! Why are you doing this?!"

Hao Qingshe giggled. "Great Envoy Shi... you wouldn't get angry at me over a dead person, would you? We've been friends for so long. You're really breaking my heart."

Her temperament was eccentric, and killing without reason was a common occurrence for her.

Shi Yufei said, "You!"

Hao Qingshe said, "Alright, alright, since the grand event is over, we can just have another competition. What's the big deal? In half an hour, this boy will be corroded to只剩 (only left with) his heart and brain. I'll take this thing back and have some fun with it."

"Whichever sect this boy belongs to, I, Qingshe, apologize. If you want compensation, there is none."

Ye Cheng's face was ashen. Though he had no personal friendship with Li Xian, he was extremely angry.

Shi Yufei looked at the other disciples, all of whom were terrified. He had organized this event with the intention of gathering disciples. This one move had essentially ruined all his previous efforts.

Shi Yufei sighed deeply. "This boy's fate is already pitiful enough. I should give him a quick end. How can I allow you to humiliate him further?"

Hao Qingshe lightly patted her sleeve. "Fine, fine... since the Great Envoy has spoken, I can't very well not listen. I'll let you handle it then. Also, he wasn't killed by me, so don't blame me for it."

Just as she was about to leave, her expression suddenly changed. She saw the poisonous mist rapidly dissolving, as a extremely pure Qi counterattacked the mist. Li Xian was seen completely unharmed, with clear Qi swirling around him.

Vaguely, it seemed as if Li Xian was wrapped in a white, hazy garment. The various strange phenomena around him made him look like a divine being. His long hair fluttered, his jade-like face was flawless, and he was incredibly handsome.

The truth was...

Li Xian had long had a countermeasure. He had condensed the Three Flowers at his apex, boiled and refined his Qi, and let the clear Qi swirl. Then, he used the "Pure Yang Qi Robe" to envelop the clear Qi. In this way, he kept the clear Qi from the Three Flowers at his apex inside a turbid robe, causing the clear Qi to linger and not disperse.

The two complemented each other.

The strange phenomena around him made him look ethereal, like an immortal. The clear Qi circled his body and would not fade, further hinting at an inner purity and outer turbidity, creating a domain of his own, a world of wonder within a short distance.

No matter how strong the poisonous mist was, it could not touch him in the slightest!

Ye Cheng and Shi Yufei were both surprised and delighted. Hao Qingshe's brows were tightly furrowed, her smile had vanished, and she stared at him intently. Shi Yufei laughed. "Excellent... Hua Wucuo, you were hiding such a technique?!"

He continued, "Hao Qingshe, we can't allow you to cause any more trouble here. You said you would leave this person to me to handle. So please, take your leave."

Hao Qingshe smiled faintly. "Great Envoy, when have I, Hao Qingshe, ever been one to keep her promises?" Suddenly, she leaped, intending to kill him herself. Shi Yufei's voice boomed, "Enough!"

His voice contained a powerful inner Qi, shaking the pavilion. Hao Qingshe's movements paused, and she was secretly surprised. This sound contained many techniques; if she强行 (forcibly) attacked, she would surely suffer.

Hao Qingshe said nonchalantly, "Great Envoy, don't try to suppress me with rules. The person I want to kill, can you protect them? If not today, then another day. What can you do about it?"

Yan Hao said in a deep voice, "You villainous woman, you are becoming more and more reckless. Do you really think no one can control you?" He had no particular good or bad feelings for Li Xian, but Hao Qingshe had acted recklessly more than once or twice. Her arrogance truly angered them.

The Flower Cage Sect was a sect that specialized in capturing women. The Water Altar was being toyed with so brazenly by a woman. Hao Qingshe said, "Oh? Vice Envoy大人 (大人)... how will you control me? With your third-rate martial arts?"

"You!" Yan Hao's face was ashen.

Hao Qingshe said, "If you want to challenge me, come at me now."

Yan Hao suppressed his anger. "Why should I fight you? What can you do if I have you confined to this island for the rest of your life?" Hao Qingshe said coldly, "I'll kill you first!"

Meng Han felt a secret panic. He never expected the situation to evolve to this point. If Hua Wucuo had not won the championship, and Hao Qingshe acted recklessly to humiliate him, the others might have been unhappy but would not have spoken out to offend her.

But Hua Wucuo had just won the championship, and she immediately wanted to kill him. She failed once and wanted to try a second time. How could they tolerate this?

Shi Yufei's voice boomed, "Everyone, quiet!" Hao Qingshe played with her snake, and Yan Hao returned to his seat.

Shi Yufei said, "Hao Qingshe... I know the sect rules are useless against you. Though your identity is special, don't go too far." Hao Qingshe remained silent.

Li Xian said, "Elders, Great Envoy... this junior has something to say, I wonder if it is appropriate." Shi Yufei said, "Speak."

Li Xian said, "Since this Hao Qingshe前辈 (前辈) insists that my victory was not fair. Very well... your disciple is still in good condition. Shall we have another match on another day?"

Shi Yufei secretly nodded. "That's an excellent plan. We will invite both parties to fight again once your disciple's injuries have healed. If... Hua Wucuo wins, this matter will be dropped. Hua Wucuo, you must not hold a grudge against Hao Qingshe. If Zeng Xiaoke wins, Hua Wucuo will be at your disposal."

Li Xian said, "Yes!" But he thought to himself, "This woman abuses her power to bully others, and without any reason, she wanted to kill me. She must be a bloodthirsty demon who kills for sport. How can I not hate her? If I get the chance, I will surely return the favor and kill her."

A storm of killing intent brewed in his chest, as solid as bedrock. But his expression was sincere and convinced, even Shi Yufei could not see through it.

Hao Qingshe said, "Fine... then I'll allow you to live a few more months." She turned to leave.

Shi Yufei said, "Wait!"

Hao Qingshe asked, "What is it?" Shi Yufei said, "During this period, if this boy dies a sudden death. Hao Qingshe... there is a limit to things. If it comes to that, don't blame me for being impolite."

"You're threatening me?" Hao Qingshe said calmly.

Shi Yufei said, "Exactly." Hao Qingshe suddenly felt the roof tiles beneath her feet tremble slightly. She let out a soft "hmph" and was secretly taken aback. She knew she had gone too far. Though she was full of viciousness and ruthlessness, and killing was a common matter for her, the timing and situation were different now. This was tantamount to slapping Shi Yufei in the face. She turned and left.

Li Xian watched her leave, his killing intent brewing, but he concealed it perfectly, not showing it in the slightest. He pondered, "My strength is still too weak. I must practice martial arts even more diligently!"

Meng Han wiped the cold sweat from his brow, feeling a sense of regret again. Shi Yufei said, "Hua Wucuo, come with me."

The observation deck of the martial arts tower was spacious. Inside sat Yan Hao, Ye Cheng, Jin Shichang, and others. Led by Shi Yufei, Li Xian went up to the pavilion's deck and greeted everyone one by one.

Li Xian was very grateful to Yan Hao and Ye Cheng for speaking up for him. Though he knew that not everyone in the Flower Cage Sect was good, he remembered their kindness in his heart. His words were polite and measured, showing an extraordinary demeanor.

"Since I began practicing martial arts, the good people I've encountered... it seems only Li Bohou. Nangong Liuli can be counted as half, at least she is quite loyal to her friends."

When Wen Caishang killed people, she was also extremely ruthless, making it hard to judge her as good or bad. Though Li Xian held fast to his bottom line, wandering in this chaotic and turbid world, he dared not hope for a spotless reputation.

Yan Hao laughed. "You are very good, you won beautifully!" Ye Cheng said, "That red mole on your forehead, could it be a sign of rebirth?"

Li Xian played dumb. "I don't know either. It just appeared suddenly." Yan Hao said, "Our Flower Cage Sect is often hunted and killed. Your appearance is very strange and extremely handsome. If you go looking for flowers in the future, you should pay attention to concealing your face."

Li Xian said, "Yes."

The people exchanged pleasantries. Li Xian got to know all the elders of the Water Altar. The Water Altar was a place for exchange and sparring, not the sect's actual location. Liu Yu would be leaving by ship on a certain day, so a banquet would be held, and he invited Li Xian to attend.

Li Xian found it hard to refuse, so he agreed.

Shi Yufei observed that Li Xian's speech and manner were excellent. Although the Flower Cage Sect was not a名门正派 (orthodox sect), if it were to be brought into the open and serve as the face of the sect, its appearance and speech should be of the highest caliber. He felt secretly satisfied. He also remembered the scene when the poisonous mist had enveloped Li Xian, his hazy white clothes making him look like a god. This technique was unique, and he found it rare.

Meng Han said with a forced smile, "Hua Wucuo, congratulations."

Li Xian said sincerely, "To be honest, the fact that I am alive today is all thanks to Elder Meng's help. I thank you here!"

Everyone was surprised to hear this. Ye Cheng asked, "What is the reason for this?" Li Xian said, "I made a bet with Senior Hao Qingshe. We will have another match after Zeng Xiaoke's injuries have healed. The premise of the bet is that Zeng Xiaoke needs to be alive. The martial arts duel was dangerous, and I did indeed strike a little too hard. Fortunately, Elder Meng rescued Zeng Xiaoke, which led to the later bet. So, in other words, for this matter... I should thank Elder Meng the most."

Ye Cheng laughed, knowing that the words held a hidden锋芒 (edge), pointing out who was behind the earlier evil deeds. Yan Hao glanced over淡淡ly (lightly). He and Hao Qingshe had just felt mutual disgust and almost came to blows. Hearing Li Xian's words, he naturally felt no goodwill towards Meng Han either.

Shi Yufei stared intently. Whenever Hao Qingshe appeared, she was always unreasonable and caused trouble. Therefore, the affairs of the Water Altar never involved her. Meng Han's "luring the snake out" was definitely with ill intent. Disrupting the order of the grand event was a highly predictable outcome. For him to still act this way was enough to show that he was narrow-minded and only cared about personal grudges. The Flower Cage Sect was not an orthodox sect to begin with, so this was not a major issue. Though Shi Yufei felt displeased, he did not reprimand him.

Meng Han glared angrily at Li Xian and gave a few awkward explanations. Li Xian thought to himself, "My own grudges must be settled by myself. Any plans I make now are futile. The only thing is to improve my strength as quickly as possible!"

He suppressed his anger and killing intent. Li Xian had won the championship, and the matter of receiving the reward should have been handled by the elders. But after the incident with Hao Qingshe, Shi Yufei personally led the way.

They arrived at the "Merit Hall".

Shi Yufei asked, "Are you new to our sect?" Li Xian answered truthfully, "Yes." Shi Yufei said, "Your appearance is not ordinary. Why did you join the Flower Cage?"

Li Xian knew he should tell the truth in this matter, so he said, "To be honest, it was a series of coincidences and accidents. I was being pursued and happened to board Elder Ye's flower boat. I used his boat to hide from my enemies."

"And I originally had no sect or faction. Since Elder Ye did not dislike my background, I took the opportunity to join the Flower Cage Sect."

Shi Yufei laughed. "You've come to the right place!" They walked to the accounting office. There were over a dozen people there, abacus in hand, calculating each "merit".

He took out "three taels of merit" and handed it to Li Xian. He then said, "I've seen your martial arts techniques. Though your skill is not shallow, they are scattered and杂乱 (disorganized). Though you have the intention to配 (match) them, you are limited by the martial arts manuals you have obtained. I imagine the martial arts you can access are limited, and you rarely have the chance to choose suitable ones."

Li Xian had successively used the "Four Directions Fist", "Breeze Legs", "Vast Legs", "Gang Thunder Finger", "Blood Spitting Manual"... on the stage. He had techniques for fists, feet, legs, and fingers, so it was indeed true that they were scattered and disorganized.

He did not have a family's martial arts, which meant he was not born into a famous noble family.

Shi Yufei said, "If you were to go to the离山剑派 (Lishan Sword Sect), 岳山剑派 (Yueshan Sword Sect), or 赤身铜门 (Red Body Copper Gate)... hehe, you would definitely be turned away at the door. This has nothing to do with talent."

Li Xian said, "Please advise me, Great Envoy."

Shi Yufei said, "Seeking a sect and asking about the martial path is a deep art. Joining a sect... represents a stable environment to gain resources. It can also build reputation and have an unlimited future."

"The roots of a sect are complex, its interests are complex, and its interests with the local noble families are complex. Even if your talent is excellent, aren't there people who envy you? The world is so vast, there is no place that is completely clean."

"Without the support of a family, how can a sect be easily entered?"

Li Xian could not help but say, "So, for those of ordinary birth, is there truly no day of rising to prominence?" Shi Yufei said, "Of course not. For those of ordinary birth, if they want to rise, they must take a detour."

"A detour?" Li Xian was curious.

Shi Yufei said, "When a sect recruits disciples, you cannot directly go to apply. Instead, you must first inquire about the family forces around the sect, and first try to become a guest of a family. Lie low for three years. If you can get a letter of recommendation, then go to the selection and apply, and you might be able to join the sect. If one year doesn't work, then two or three years. As long as you succeed, you will have a relatively stable path to resources."

"If you cannot get a letter of recommendation, you should observe even more carefully. Find opportunities to get to know figures from the sect, actively participate in江湖 (jianghu) duels, catch criminals and seize bandits, display your talent, make good friends, attend grand events, or engage in琴棋书画 (music, chess, calligraphy, painting), 曲笛舞乐 (songs, flutes, dances, music)... step by step, build your reputation. If you do these two things well, you can also join a sect."

"This is the detour! All the paths you can see are straight paths. For those of ordinary birth, walking straight will inevitably lead to a wall. You must take a winding path and seek your way step by step."

Shi Yufei said nostalgically, "I was an ordinary farmer back then. To have reached today, I took many detours."

"Similarly... if you want to live, you also need to take a detour."

Li Xian said, "Great Envoy, are you saying that with just the bet, Senior Hao Qingshe will not spare my life?"

Shi Yufei said, "Of course." Li Xian said, "Then the bet..."

Shi Yufei said, "The bet must still be fulfilled, but you need to be even more cautious. At the same time, you need to prepare for the 'detour'."

Li Xian said, "Please speak plainly, Great Envoy."

Shi Yufei smiled. "Have you ever heard of the 'Candle Cult'?"
