# Chapter 59: Crystal Bone Realm Achieved, Mid-Stage First Rank Body Cultivator  

After setting up his stall, Qi Chuan waited quietly until finally, a young cultivator stopped by.  

The young man glanced at the top-grade Fireball Talisman displayed at the front of the stall and asked in surprise, "Is this a first-rank top-grade talisman?"  

"Correct," Qi Chuan replied calmly, though inwardly pleased to have his first customer.  

"How much for this top-grade Fireball Talisman?" the young cultivator inquired, eyeing the talisman with curiosity.  

"This one isn't for sale," Qi Chuan shook his head.  

Though the top-grade talisman was more valuable, having only one wouldn't make much difference. Displaying it served as an attraction—a way to draw in potential buyers. The same logic applied to his promotion: buy three mid-grade talismans, get one low-grade one free.  

"Not for sale? Then why display it?" The young cultivator looked baffled.  

"Just to draw attention to the stall," Qi Chuan answered plainly.  

"Drawing attention? How pointless." With that, the young man turned to leave.  

Qi Chuan didn't try to stop him, simply waiting for the next customer. However, after taking a few steps, the young man suddenly turned back and, under Qi Chuan's gaze, pointed at the sign on the stall.  

"Four low-grade spirit stones for one mid-grade talisman, and buying three gets a free low-grade one. Can I choose the type of the free talisman?"  

"Of course," Qi Chuan nodded with a smile. He had no reason to restrict that.  

"Then give me three mid-grade talismans—one Fireball, one Golden Skin, and one Earth Wall. For the free one, I'll take a Vine Binding Talisman." The young cultivator handed over twelve low-grade spirit stones without hesitation.  

Qi Chuan happily accepted the payment and retrieved the requested talismans. With the transaction complete, the young man left, marking the end of Qi Chuan's first sale.  

After the first customer, others gradually approached the stall.  

An hour later, Qi Chuan had sold several dozen mid-grade talismans. He then paid for another hour of stall rental.  

By the end of the second hour, he had sold over 140 of the 200-plus mid-grade talismans he had brought, leaving only a few dozen unsold. Seeing little point in continuing, he packed up and left.  

"This trip netted me over 500 spirit stones—not bad at all."  

---  

Qi Chuan was quite satisfied with his earnings. The profits had covered the cost of the Mystic Elephant Spirit Brush, ink, and talisman paper, with an extra hundred or so spirit stones to spare. Now, he could use this sum to further his cultivation.  

With that in mind, he left White Moon Market and headed back toward the direction of the Breeze Moon Sect.  

This time, his journey was uneventful—no followers or ambushes.  

"Perhaps the Breeze Moon Sect's reputation deters most bandits," he mused.  

Soon, he returned to the inner sect and made his way to the Alchemy Pavilion.  

"Hello, I need these herbs."  

On the fourth floor, Qi Chuan handed a list to a middle-aged attendant behind the counter. The man glanced at it, nodded, and went to gather the requested ingredients.  

Moments later, he returned with a large medicinal bundle—more than twice the size of the one Qi Chuan had purchased when cultivating the first layer of the Minor Crystal Jade Body technique.  

"Fifteen inner sect contribution points, or 150 low-grade spirit stones," the attendant stated impassively.  

"Such a price increase..." Qi Chuan sighed inwardly.  

But since these herbs were necessary for the second layer of the Minor Crystal Jade Body, he paid without complaint. After collecting the bundle, he stopped by the lower floors to replenish his dwindling stock of Essence Gathering Pills before returning to his top-grade cave abode.  

There, he prepared another large vat of medicinal bath.  

In a stone chamber, Qi Chuan gazed at the thick, dark-red liquid before stepping in without hesitation. He sat cross-legged, submerging himself up to his neck.  

The scalding heat of the medicinal water seeped into his skin, but his expression remained unchanged. Having reached the peak of the first-rank early-stage body cultivation, such temperatures no longer affected him.  

---  

He then activated the second-layer cultivation method of the Minor Crystal Jade Body.  

The medicinal energy separated from the viscous liquid and seeped into his pores, reinforcing his flesh and bones. In particular, his skeletal structure gradually grew harder and more translucent under the infusion of energy.  

A short while later, Qi Chuan opened his eyes to see a line of text appear before him:  

**[You absorbed medicinal energy while cultivating the second layer of the Minor Crystal Jade Body, triggering a 50x critical effect. Your body has been significantly strengthened.]**  

He faintly sensed a subtle change in his bones—the slight reinforcement from the medicinal bath had been amplified dozens of times in an instant, making the enhancement perceptible.  

"Continue."  

With that, Qi Chuan closed his eyes and resumed his cultivation.  

The only reason he hadn't progressed to the second layer earlier was a lack of funds—not any inherent difficulty. Now, with his wealth from talisman sales, he could cultivate without restraint.  

As his body greedily absorbed the medicinal energy, his progress accelerated.  

---  

Half a year passed in the blink of an eye.  

During this time, Qi Chuan dedicated most of his efforts to the second layer of the Minor Crystal Jade Body while never neglecting his daily cultivation of the Evergreen Art. His spiritual energy had improved considerably, bringing him closer to the sixth level of Qi Refinement.  

Occasionally, he practiced his already-perfected basic elemental spells and the Clear Sight technique. The latter, still in its foundational stage, showed rapid improvement and was nearing the minor mastery level despite only sporadic training.  

His talisman-crafting skills also advanced. To fund his cultivation and medicinal needs, he periodically produced batches of mid- and top-grade talismans to sell at various markets under the Breeze Moon Sect's jurisdiction.  

Thanks to his golden finger's critical effects, he was gradually approaching the level of a first-rank supreme talisman master. Supreme-grade talismans were potent enough to threaten even peak Qi Refinement cultivators.  

Yet, none of these advancements compared to the breakthrough he was about to achieve.  

At this moment, Qi Chuan sat in the medicinal vat within his cave abode. The once-dark liquid had faded to a pale red as the last traces of energy were absorbed into his body.  

As the water turned clear, Qi Chuan slowly opened his eyes. A line of text appeared before him:  

**[You absorbed medicinal energy while cultivating the second layer of the Minor Crystal Jade Body, triggering a 100x critical effect. Your body has undergone a tremendous enhancement. You have successfully mastered the Crystal Bone Realm of the Minor Crystal Jade Body and advanced to mid-stage first-rank body cultivation.]**  

In that instant, his bones radiated a crystalline glow, illuminating the humble stone chamber with dazzling light.
