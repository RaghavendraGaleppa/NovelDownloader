# Chapter 145: Zhou Qing's First Sermon

After collecting the first drop of mulberry dew in a small jade vial, Zhou Qing confirmed its exceptional quality. He stored it carefully for future alchemical experiments.

Once the great mulberry tree took root in its new home within the Water Manor, it immediately connected with the spiritual veins beneath. The tree's inherent ability to gather spiritual energy now enhanced the quality of these veins. Over time, this would undoubtedly lead to further improvements in the spiritual veins' quality—a crucial factor for cultivators, especially high-level practitioners whose daily cultivation benefits greatly from superior spiritual environments.

Using his Insightful Eyes of Truth, Zhou Qing observed that the Water Manor's operations could now be entirely sustained by the spiritual energy gathered by the mulberry tree. The spiritual energy in the manor's herb garden was already comparable to that at the core of Tianxuan City's spiritual veins. As the mulberry tree continued to grow and refine the veins, it wouldn't be surprising if the Water Manor's spiritual energy eventually surpassed Tianxuan City's by a significant margin.

Unlike most high-level cultivators or other beings who only deplete spiritual veins, the "Heavenly Spiritual Root" that was the mulberry tree actually enhanced them, gathering and stabilizing spiritual energy while transforming the area into a blessed land. Zhou Qing deduced that the Primordial Qi produced by the Earth Cauldron was essential for the mulberry tree's growth, though currently in small amounts.

To ensure a steady supply, Zhou Qing periodically sent the Earth Armored Dragon to collect earth-attribute spiritual materials to cultivate the Ganoderma. If the dragon slacked off, its blood could serve as an equally effective substitute—a minor bloodletting that Zhou Qing considered beneficial for the creature's health.

Zhou Qing also contemplated experimenting with the blood of his rooster companion, Angri, once it reached the Golden Core level, given its regenerative abilities. His own Five Elements True Body already allowed for limb regeneration, and further advancement might lead to full-body regeneration—though the resources required for such a feat would be staggering.

Attempting to nourish the mulberry tree with Primordial Heavy Water proved ineffective, though the water did benefit the Cyan Firmament Sword. With only one drop of the second-layer Primordial Heavy Water, Zhou Qing needed more water-attribute spiritual materials to produce another—a task for which the Divine Water Palace seemed ideal.

After relocating the peach tree to guard the teleportation array in Jiangzhou's herb garden, Zhou Qing entrusted its protection to the little snake. The peach tree's ability to replenish vitality also aided the snake's cultivation. Additionally, Zhou Qing provided Lin Wan'er with a high-grade defensive robe and brought her to the Water Manor.

Though his Inner World could accommodate living beings, Zhou Qing chose to physically transport the peach tree rather than reveal this ability, which even Nascent Soul cultivators lacked. He planned to develop a trapping and killing technique based on his Inner World, tentatively named "Sleeve Cosmos," though the mechanics required further refinement.

Zhou Qing also crafted disposable teleportation talismans using the Cosmic Displacement Token, allowing others to return to the mortal realm via the Water Manor's array. He distributed these to Fushou, Zhang Jingxiu, Lin Wan'er, and Yuan Mingyue, with Lin Wan'er receiving five to manage the transportation of cultivation resources back to the mortal realm every three months.

Fushou, despite his playful demeanor, was entrusted with one talisman for personal use, while Zhang Jingxiu focused on breaking through to the True Body realm. Zhou Qing himself remained in the Water Manor, preparing for the eventual escape of the Howling Moon Demon decades or centuries hence.

Though Zhou Qing could hide using his Thousand Illusions technique, Tianxuan City would face destruction without him. Honoring Patriarch Tianxuan's trust and utilizing the city's resources, Zhou Qing aimed to prevent this outcome while ensuring his own survival first.

Zhou Qing then visited Butcher Hu in the mortal realm, offering him the inner core of the Black Yang Tiger for a unique demon-seeding process—an unprecedented method in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Through the Tiger Demon King's empowerment, Hu successfully integrated the core, transforming into a half-tiger demon form. Though the process was grueling, Hu embraced the chance to grow stronger, determined to ascend alongside Zhou Qing.

After advising Hu on his cultivation regimen, Zhou Qing departed, leaving the butcher to his fate. True immortality couldn't be granted by others; it had to be earned.

At Desolate Ridge, Fushou excelled in social engagements, embodying the Dao Court's external affairs. His charm and Zhou Qing's reputation opened many doors, though he modestly avoided flaunting his connection. When pressed to give a sermon on cultivation basics, Fushou hesitated until Zhou Qing suggested he attend his own lecture first and later share his understanding.

Back at Qingfu Temple, Zhou Qing delivered his first sermon to the Dao Court's three thousand disciples. Ascending amidst celestial phenomena—with Angri manifesting as a second sun—Zhou Qing spoke not of techniques but of the essence of cultivation: the pursuit of truth amidst illusion.

Through vivid illusions of a caterpillar's life cycle—eating, cocooning, emerging as a butterfly, and dying—Zhou Qing illustrated the perpetual cycle of life and the transient nature of existence. Despite the inevitable end, he challenged his audience: "Even so, can you persevere?"

The question resonated deeply, leaving all in contemplative silence.
