Chapter 62: The Living Perfume Bottles

With the departure of Steward Zhang and the others, the vast fortress of Feng'anbao became deserted.

In the main hall of the principal residence, only Yang Can, Bao Zitou, Xiao Qingmei, and Accountant Li remained.

Bao Zitou said, "The Lord needs someone to manage the inner residence, and guards for the outer grounds. Does the Lord plan to hire people from the village?"

Qingmei immediately objected. "Hiring from the village wouldn't be appropriate. If we do that, any little happening in our household will be known to the entire village in no time."

Qingmei thought for a moment and suggested, "Why don't we ask the Young Mistress to allocate a group of people?"

Yang Can shook his head. They might be familiar, but did she really want to fill his surroundings with the Suo family's eyes?

" The Young Mistress needs people around her too," Yang Can said. "I only transferred you here, and I don't know if she can bear to part with you. To take more people from her? Let's just forget it."

Actually, Qingmei didn't have any other intentions. In her heart, she saw Suo Chanzhi and Yang Can as her own people, not distinguishing between them. When Yang Can objected, she immediately realized it was inappropriate.

Li Damu's eyes darted around. "Lord, why not send someone to Tianshui City to find a slave trader and buy some servants from him? Such servants have signed contracts of sale; they can only serve the master and are therefore extremely loyal."

Upon hearing this, Yang Can felt a sudden flash of inspiration. "Good, that's an excellent idea!"

Accountant Li was now also retained by Yang Can at Feng'anbao. Naturally, he had originally been the chief accountant of the main branch, so his status couldn't be lowered. Therefore, his official registration remained with the main branch, but he actually managed the finances of Feng'an Village. This place needed a chief accountant, and Li Damu, who had a weakness in Yang Can's hands, was the most suitable candidate in Yang Can's heart.

Yang Can said with a smile, "Mr. Li, your method is very good. Are you satisfied with your appointment at Feng'an Village?"

From now on, Xiao Tan officially belonged to Li Damu. Because he had mentioned it to Zhang Yunyi under Yang Can's name, Zhang Yunyi naturally agreed readily. Of course, Yang Can had also asked Steward Zhang for a person. He wanted Zhu Weipeng; that chef's skills had conquered his stomach.

Li Damu, who was currently very satisfied, immediately beamed with joy. "Satisfied, satisfied. I, Li, am extremely satisfied to be able to serve the Lord."

"Good," Yang Can said. "The matter of finding a slave trader to purchase servants is entrusted entirely to you, Mr. Li. You can choose a time and go to Tianshui City as soon as possible to find a slave trader to bring here."

Accountant Li was overjoyed. Even if he was careful, there was still a lot of profit to be made from this. Being in charge of procurement has always been a lucrative job since ancient times.

Qingmei cautioned, "Tell the slave trader to bring plenty of servants. Our Lord needs to pick and choose. We don't want any rotten apples or malformed melons in our house."

Accountant Li smiled obsequiously. "Of course, of course. When the people are brought back, they must first pass Miss Qingmei's inspection."

Hearing this, Qingmei finally felt relieved. It didn't matter if there were a few rotten apples or malformed melons; the important thing was not to buy a seductress back. What if she exhausted the Lord's body?

After a series of upheavals, Feng'an Village gradually settled down. The spring plowing would soon give way to spring sowing, and life had to go on. This was a major event concerning the livelihood for the entire year; who could keep their energy focused on the personnel changes at Feng'an Village?

In short, the upper echelons of Feng'an Village had undergone a major reshuffle, but it hadn't had much impact on the lives of the common people, and they were content.

Yang Can kept those stewards who had bullied men and women in the past but had not committed unforgivable crimes on probation. It wasn't that he could tolerate such things, but rather that he was considering the bigger picture. He could start establishing order now, making these people abide by his new rules. But he couldn't replace all of them. If he selected a new batch directly from the common people, they might not know how to do the job. Yang Can didn't have the patience to train them from scratch, and the situation didn't allow him to do so.

Wangcai came rushing over from Phoenix Mountain Villa with a small bundle. His master was going to live in Feng'anbao for a long time; what was he doing staying up on the mountain? He brought Yang Can a jar of sealed "Butter." This was naturally made by Pan Furen, Xiao Wan. The two places weren't far apart, and Yang Can returned to Phoenix Mountain Villa every few days. By making frequent reports and inquiries, he could dispel the doubts of the Alliance Master, Yu Xinglong. In this process, it seemed he also had to return gifts from time to time. However, if he were to "be given butter, and return butter," that would be impossible.

Because he had concurrently taken on the role of Feng'an Village's Steward, for the time being, Yang Can didn't have the time to inspect the remaining five villages and three pastures. But if he didn't go, the sword hanging over the heads of these five villages and three pastures would never fall. As long as the sword didn't fall, the stewards of these pastures and villages would remain anxious and work even harder. Of course, Yu Huanhu's factor was also indispensable in this. Yu Huanhu hadn't secretly instructed them to "put in a bad word" for the Alliance Master, Yu Xinglong. Because Yu Huanhu suddenly discovered that Yang Can was not only the second steward of the Young Mistress, Suo's branch, but also a pawn sent by his brother, Yu Xinglong, to the Young Mistress's side to annoy the Suo family. If such a person were used well, he might produce unexpected results in the future. His brother, Yu Xinglong, had clearly already found a scapegoat, just waiting for the autumn harvest to see if the yield was low, so he could push him out to quell public anger. Since he couldn't shake his brother, he didn't intend to play such tricks anymore. He set his sights on Yang Can. For this reason, Yu Huanhu directly sent his eldest son, Yu Rui. With him holding down the fort in Dailai City, Yu Rui could leave. These two father and son would not leave their foundation at the same time.

Now, the private troops of Feng'an Village were still led by Kang Zhengyang as the troop leader. Among the stewards, Yang Can promoted a few new people who were barely usable. Bao Zitou, Cheng Dakuan, became his chief steward of Feng'anbao, a role somewhat similar to that of Wan Tai by Steward Zhang's side. Xiao Qingmei didn't get jealous of Bao Zitou or argue with him over who was the chief steward. Because her current goal was not to be the chief steward of Feng'anbao, but to be the mistress of Feng'anbao... one of them. Of course, she didn't dare to think of being the only one. Even if her young mistress, due to her status, couldn't formally marry Yang Can, that wasn't a reason for her to take her place.

Yang Can was now solely focused on making Feng'an Village a model. The other villages were all watching him. Seeing what he did, they would have plenty of time to think, choose, and respond. And such responses would inevitably be dominated by compromise. That was exactly what Yang Can wanted. Of course, if there really were someone who was blind and wanted to challenge him, he wouldn't mind making them the second Zhang Yunyi, or even having a worse fate than Zhang Yunyi.

However, even the new measures he implemented in Feng'an Village were still pushed forward by Zhang Yunyi. He had Zhang Yunyi organize a team to calibrate all the measuring tools and scales used in the village. He also had Zhang Yunyi establish rules for regular inspections and irregular spot checks. For the village's processing facilities like rice mills and oil mills, Yang Can also had Zhang Yunyi organize a team to rectify them and formulate stricter management measures. Don't look down on these measures, thinking they are trivial and useless. For the people, food is paramount. These trivial matters are of great importance to them. With Zhang Yunyi at the forefront, they could be implemented with maximum efficiency. For now, Zhang Yunyi still had some use in Feng'an Village. Of course, everyone knew that the hand behind Zhang Yunyi was Steward Yang's. Yang Can was gradually becoming the new king in the hearts of the people of Feng'an.

At this time, Li Damu returned to Feng'anbao with a "slave trader" he found in Tianshui. A "slave trader" is a human trafficker. The difference is that most human traffickers are officially registered and engage in officially licensed slave trading. The sources of slaves from such slave traders are more reliable. However, the slaves in their hands are relatively lacking in diversity. Moreover, these human traffickers mostly do business with regular customers in fixed areas. It would be difficult to ask them to bring a large number of slaves from Tianshui City to Feng'anbao for Yang Can to select and buy. But "slave traders" are different. These people who walk the gray business chain will go anywhere as long as there is money to be made. The slaves in their hands are also of various sources, but almost none of them are willing to sell themselves.

The "slave trader" Li Damu contacted was named Qian Yuan. Merchant Qian was a big slave owner. Originally, he looked down on the business of a mere village. But he heard from Li Damu that this Feng'an Village Lord wanted to buy enough slaves to fill the entire fortress. He also heard that this Feng'an Village Lord concurrently managed the other five villages and three pastures. That was different. Not only was this business worth doing, but this person was also worth making friends with. So, Merchant Qian brought his slaves and came. This slave trader's team was very large, with more than two hundred people. Riding on horses were Qian Yuan's guards, about forty of them. They all wore cloth towels wrapped around their heads, long linen robes, and carried swords at their waists, looking fierce. As for the mule carts, they were used to transport slaves. Most of the slaves walked along with the carts, but some were squeezed onto the carts. The slaves squeezed onto the carts were not necessarily old people; older ones couldn't be sold for much money. Slave traders all disliked them for wasting food and were too lazy to buy them, unless they had special skills. The carts mainly carried women and children. Among them, one cart was very different from the slave carts. This cart was gorgeously decorated, with silk curtains hanging all around. It was Qian Yuan's carriage.

"My Lord, we've arrived at Feng'anbao," a guard walked to the side of the carriage and reported to the person inside.

Merchant Qian was sitting in the carriage, holding a crystal cup in his hand. There was still a little red wine left in the cup, which he was gently swirling. Upon hearing the voice, Merchant Qian drank the fine wine in one gulp and handed the crystal cup to the beautiful youth beside him. The youth was about thirteen or fourteen years old, with delicate features. After being dressed up, his charm was almost demonic. There were two such beautiful youths on the carriage. Both were handpicked by Merchant Qian from among the slaves. They served Qian Yuan, always staying by his side whether he was sitting, lying down, getting up, or sleeping. Merchant Qian jokingly called them "living perfume bottles." Because they had to wear incense-infused clothes and carry strange fragrance pouches, they were fragrant all over.

Qian Yuan slowly stood up. The carriage was wide and tall, and with his tall stature, he could stand up straight without bending over. Another handsome youth had already stepped forward and lifted the curtain for him. Qian Yuan affectionately pinched his粉腮 (pink cheek), then walked out of the carriage. In front of the carriage, a slave was already kneeling on both knees, hands on the ground, serving as a stepping stool. Merchant Qian stepped out of the carriage and, stepping on the slave's back, stood firmly on the ground.
