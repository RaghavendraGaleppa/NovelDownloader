# Chapter 109: Buddhist Chant

After studying the 'Ice Heart Jade Mind Technique,' Li Shimin, though not yet mastering spiritual sense, came to understand the importance of temperament for cultivators. This was precisely why it was essential to master spiritual sense during the Qi Refinement stage. 

Had there been only one or two cultivators lying in ambush here, he might not have considered engaging in combat. 

If there were only one or two, it was highly likely that sect disciples would be among them. With his Qi Refinement fourth-layer strength, the odds of defeating two sect disciples were slim. 

But with ten cultivators appearing, it indicated that their individual strength was limited, relying on numbers to bridge the gap. 

In other words, all ten were rogue cultivators. 

Moreover, Li Shimin had already mastered the Sword Flight technique and could escape at any moment. There was no reason for him not to fight. 

This was an opportunity to test his combat prowess while also tempering his temperament. 

He took out two spirit stones, holding them in his hands to replenish his spiritual energy, and stood at the exit of Long Stone Valley, blocking the path of the ten cultivators. 

"How could he be a sword cultivator?" Han Yu muttered in shock. 

Sword cultivators had always been the most formidable fighters among cultivators, and a Qi Refinement sword cultivator was the strongest attacker at that stage. 

He had no desire to fight a sword cultivator—it would only lead to casualties among his clan's disciples. 

But that sword light had pierced through the formation and now hovered at the valley's exit. Han Yu understood the message: the opponent was waiting for them to come out and fight. 

"Gather and form a battle formation!" Han Yu's eyes flashed with ruthlessness. 

He refused to believe that ten cultivators couldn't defeat a single sect disciple. 

Besides, even if Li Shimin was a sword cultivator, how much combat experience could he have after less than a year in the sect? 

Among their ten cultivators, aside from Han Yu at Qi Refinement sixth-layer, two were at fifth-layer, and the rest were all fourth-layer. 

The ten cultivators leaped down from the valley walls, gathering together with Han Yu at the spearhead, forming a mortal battle formation. 

Han Yu stared at Li Shimin standing at the valley's entrance. The latter's robes fluttered in the wind, exuding an indescribable aura. 

Even facing ten Qi Refinement mid-stage cultivators, Han Yu saw no trace of fear or worry in Li Shimin's eyes—only a burning battle intent. 

"Damn it, this is definitely a sword cultivator—a sword lunatic!" Han Yu cursed inwardly. 

Li Shimin also observed the ten cultivators. The distance between them was still over five hundred meters, beyond attack range. 

Qi Refinement mid-stage cultivators had limited attack ranges. Even long-range spells could only reach about a hundred meters. 

He put away his drone and visor, his eyes scanning Long Stone Valley while IBMz15 analyzed the terrain. 

Long Stone Valley was unique—its exit was narrower while the interior widened. 

After assessing the cultivators' strength, Li Shimin relaxed. There was no need to worry about any of them escaping. 

With no chance of escape, he could unleash his full arsenal without restraint. 

His demeanor suddenly shifted. The approaching Han Yu and the others felt as though Li Shimin had transformed into a different person. 

A compassionate, monk-like aura radiated from him as he opened his mouth and began chanting. 

This was a chant infused with background music through 'Demonic Sound Infiltration'—a piece called 'First Light of Buddha,' which should not have existed in this world. 

Amid the majestic music, Li Shimin appeared to the ten cultivators as if bathed in golden Buddhist light. 

'Demonic Sound Infiltration' was a mental attack, far too advanced for rogue cultivators. Led by Han Yu, none of them immediately realized the danger as the music played. 

Their steps slowed. At first, they were curious about how Li Shimin could produce the accompanying sounds of suonas and drums with his voice. Then, they fell under the influence of 'First Light of Buddha.' 

Their battle intent waned, and their killing intent diminished. 

The weaker-willed among them even began reflecting on their past actions, feeling pangs of guilt. 

"Focus! He's using sound to influence our minds!" Han Yu, being the strongest at Qi Refinement sixth-layer, was the first to snap out of it. 

Though he didn't know soundwave techniques, he used the simplest method—channeling spiritual energy to let out a loud shout. 

The other cultivators jolted awake, stabilizing their minds, their eyes filled with terror. 

They hadn't even engaged in combat yet and had nearly fallen victim to his trick. 

Moreover, the music would severely hinder their fighting ability. 

They needed to constantly steady their minds, preventing them from fighting at full strength. 

Fortunately, they had numbers on their side. With mutual support, they still had a chance. 

The distance between them narrowed. Li Shimin stood at the valley's entrance, his expression serene and compassionate. 

Having practiced the 'Vajra Protection Divine Art' for a long time while listening to the 'Diamond Sutra,' Li Shimin could channel Vajra power through IBMz15's recitation of 'First Light of Buddha,' enhancing its effects. 

Vajra power, a Buddhist body-refining force, amplified the potency of 'First Light of Buddha.' 

He didn't expect 'Demonic Sound Infiltration' to wipe them all out. Unless he had the complete version and reached at least Qi Refinement sixth-layer—matching the strongest among them—it was impossible. 

And that was assuming all were rogue cultivators. Sect disciples had some resistance to soundwave attacks. 

Sect disciples, having to contend with the Profound Nether Sect, were trained to defend against such techniques. 

As Han Yu led the group closer, nearing the hundred-meter mark, Li Shimin suddenly changed his chant. 

A piece called 'Soul-Snatching Buddhist Chant' emerged, transforming the Buddhist melody into something sinister, amplifying the mental assault of 'Demonic Sound Infiltration.' 

The music was solemn, the words devout Buddhist mantras, yet an undeniable evil seeped through. 

The valley instantly felt like the Avici Hell. Even Han Yu felt his scalp tingle. 

At the hundred-meter mark—the acoustic focal point of Long Stone Valley—Li Shimin's positioning was deliberate. 

'Soul-Snatching Buddhist Chant,' amplified by the valley's reverberations, grew even more potent. Its synergy with 'Demonic Sound Infiltration' was terrifying. 

Li Shimin hadn't anticipated this. As the chant reached its climax, the ten cultivators arrived at the hundred-meter point. 

Righteous and evil, Buddhist and demonic—the conflicting forces swirled in their ears, tempting them to lay down their weapons and repent. 

Li Shimin summoned the Spirit Turtle Shield. Though he hadn't refined it deeply, his familiarity with its formations allowed him to activate its defensive arrays. 

A spiritual hand placed three spirit stones on the shield's back, and as the formations activated, a barrier enveloped him. 

This barrier rivaled the strongest high-grade defensive artifacts—far beyond what these rogue cultivators could breach. 

The Spirit Turtle Shield was one of his trump cards, ensuring his near-invincibility. 

Among the ten cultivators, only Han Yu and the two fifth-layer disciples remained relatively unaffected by 'Soul-Snatching Buddhist Chant.' The rest were dazed, unable to maintain their protective spells. 

The two fifth-layer cultivators were barely holding on. 

Han Yu wanted to shout another warning, but his cultivation was only slightly higher. Like the others, he could barely protect himself. 

His expression changed as he realized the vast gap between rogue and sect cultivators. 

The sect disciples they'd encountered before must have been weaklings. Now, facing a true powerhouse, the difference was stark. 

At the same time, Han Yu felt resentment toward his younger brother, Han Tianlei. Had Han Tianlei sent them to ambush such a terrifying sword cultivator just to exterminate the Han Clan? 

Or was Han Tianlei planning a major move in the sect and wanted to erase past misdeeds? 

It wasn't unreasonable to think so. Among cultivators, clans were often just alliances for mutual benefit. 

Given sufficient incentive, many would abandon their clans for personal gain. 

As Han Yu's thoughts scattered under the chant's influence, Li Shimin moved. 

For the first time, Li Shimin advanced. Though he lacked high-level movement techniques, 'Light Body Technique' sufficed for the hundred-meter gap. 

Channeling the 'Vajra Protection Divine Art,' Vajra power surged through his legs, boosting his speed. 

In moments, he closed to thirty meters—the effective range of his 'Sword Control Art.' 

Han Yu reacted swiftly. Despite the chant's influence, he instinctively hurled two mid-grade attack talismans. 

Li Shimin didn't dodge. The talismans struck his barrier harmlessly. 

Meanwhile, the Green Kite Wood Sword's light flashed past the talismans, piercing the enemy formation. 

The Spirit Turtle Shield's barrier flickered as flames erupted, but it didn't waver. 

The Green Kite Wood Sword, a high-grade artifact, sliced through the rogue cultivators' defenses effortlessly, enhanced by the 'Sword Control Art.' 

Seven of them, already defenseless, fell swiftly as the sword light danced among them. 

Screams filled the air. Li Shimin prioritized eliminating the seven weakest—all at Qi Refinement fourth-layer like him. 

Without 'Demonic Sound Infiltration,' this battle would have been far more troublesome. 

As the saying goes, even ants can kill an elephant—let alone cultivators of the same level. 

The screams jolted the two fifth-layer cultivators awake. They summoned their artifacts, preparing to strike, when a blinding flash robbed them of vision. 

This was another function of the Spirit Turtle Shield—a dazzling burst of light, highly effective against Qi Refinement cultivators. 

Without spiritual sense, their attacks relied on sight. The sudden flash left them momentarily blind, unable to target. 

The Green Kite Wood Sword's true power shone. The two fifth-layer cultivators' defenses lasted less than a breath before crumbling. 

Han Yu was stunned. Of the ten clansmen who had come to ambush, only he remained after a single exchange. 

Li Shimin switched back to 'First Light of Buddha,' its majestic pressure further eroding Han Yu's will to fight. 

The corpses on the ground, the solemn chant, even the Vajra power within Li Shimin—all exuded Buddhist majesty, like the rising sun shattering Han Yu's last resolve. 

The final blow was the Green Kite Wood Sword, its cold light flickering ominously around him. 

Han Yu's legs gave way. A Qi Refinement sixth-layer cultivator collapsed before a fourth-layer opponent. 

The sword light flashed as Li Shimin used 'Sword Control Art' to seal Han Yu's spiritual energy. 

"Amitabha!" Just as he subdued Han Yu and stopped chanting, a Buddhist mantra echoed from above. 

Li Shimin shuddered. His sword light, already condensed, flared brighter and fiercer. 

For someone to approach undetected, their strength far surpassed his. If hostile, he would fight with everything he had. 

The sword light aimed skyward, where an old monk sat atop a gourd, smiling down. 

The monk showed no interest in intervening. Cultivator conflicts were rarely clear-cut. 

He had been drawn by Li Shimin's Buddhist chant, arriving at the battle's onset. 

Noticing the Vajra power within Li Shimin, were it not for the Heavenly Sea Sect robes, he would have mistaken him for a Buddhist disciple. 

"Esteemed benefactor, I am Monk Duyuan," the old monk said, alighting and folding his hands in greeting. 

"May I ask your purpose, Venerable Duyuan? If you wish to save this man, I can hand him over," Li Shimin said, holding Han Yu. 

He retracted his sword light—there was no point. 

As Monk Duyuan landed, his aura revealed his cultivation—at least Foundation Establishment stage. 

Against such power, Li Shimin's tricks were child's play. 

Even summoning his clone would be futile—the gap was insurmountable. 

Most importantly, he sensed no malice from Monk Duyuan. Perhaps the monk was merely making conversation.
