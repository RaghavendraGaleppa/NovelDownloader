# Chapter 104: Crisis Ahead

Upon returning to the Nightingale organization, Lin Shan suddenly discovered that the Marquis of Bowang's residence had once again stationed a cultivator. 

The Grand Elder introduced him to a young man at the second level of Qi Refinement—his own great-grandson. This matter was actually somewhat related to Lin Shan.

It turned out the Grand Elder's great-grandson had previously attempted cultivation but became stuck at the initial stage of sensing spiritual energy—barely able to perceive it but unable to complete the transcendence. The Grand Elder then devised a clever workaround: he asked Lin Shan to purchase a Heaven and Earth spiritual item, the Vermilion Fruit. This bypassed the need to absorb energy from the world, directly infusing spiritual power to forcibly awaken spiritual consciousness.

After consuming the fruit, the young man finally stepped into the ranks of cultivators. However, with limited spiritual energy from a single fruit and the consumption during attribute conversion, his cultivation stagnated at the second level of Qi Refinement.

Based on the young man's situation, Lin Shan could roughly deduce that his spiritual root aptitude was quite poor, likely of an inferior grade. Still, becoming a cultivator and serving as a mascot for Nightingale wasn't a bad outcome. The Grand Elder clearly thought the same, instructing his great-grandson to remain with Nightingale and avoid venturing into cultivation markets. The young man was obedient, taking his great-grandfather's words to heart and showing great respect to Lin Shan.

After some brief pleasantries and offering cultivation guidance, Lin Shan asked the Grand Elder to gather information about Princess Guo and the middle-aged man in brocade robes—the heir of Prince Qi.

Nightingale's intelligence network proved efficient. Within half an hour, they had results.

The heir of Prince Qi had died of illness half a month prior. Before his death, something seemed to have gone terribly wrong—the entire Prince Qi's residence was wiped out. Rumor had it this was related to the imperial family's Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Lin Shan felt a chill hearing this. He had no idea how things had ultimately unfolded. What became of that strange giant eyeball? He couldn't exactly ask the imperial Foundation Establishment cultivator or Thundercloud Master.

As for Princess Guo, the Grand Elder sighed. Ten days ago, for unknown reasons, she had broken through to late-stage Qi Refinement and joined a Yingchuan cultivation sect called the Cangxuan Sect as an inner disciple.

This news made Lin Shan leap to his feet in alarm. Princess Guo's sudden advancement to late-stage Qi Refinement was undoubtedly due to support from the imperial Foundation Establishment elder. Why the elder chose to cultivate her now rather than before remained a mystery, but Lin Shan was certain it involved him in some way.

Princess Guo reaching late-stage Qi Refinement wasn't particularly concerning—Lin Shan could handle that. But her joining a cultivation sect made exacting revenge much more difficult. Storming the sect would be suicidal. Though not one of the three great sects, any established sect would have at least a Golden Core cultivator overseeing it.

A curse? That option carried significant risks. Having previously cursed the middle-aged brocade-robed man, targeting Princess Guo might allow the clever woman to connect the dots. The imperial Foundation Establishment elder might also deduce something, potentially exposing Lin Shan's curse ability. Moreover, he lacked any of Princess Guo's personal belongings, hair, or blood for the curse. He'd had the chance to collect such items by the stream but was interrupted by the red-faced monk from the Joyous Sect, only managing to obtain the brocade-robed man's talisman sword.

Thinking of the red-faced monk made Lin Shan's teeth itch with anger. Not only had the man cost him hundreds of spirit stones at the auction, but he'd also come specifically to hunt him down. Lin Shan could have permanently dealt with Princess Guo and the brocade-robed man in the Yan Yun Mountains if not for the monk's interference, which had thrown everything into chaos.

"Good. I've acquired several more Joyous Buddha statues in Jiangdong. If you dare come after me again..." Lin Shan had already devised a plan to bait the monk.

The Joyous Sect had long been destroyed. Half a year since the Jiangdong ruins were excavated, no Joyous Sect disciples had appeared to collect the statues—only rogue cultivators and Monk Xingtai had been gathering them enthusiastically. This indicated the current Joyous Sect was a paper tiger with only a few remaining members.

Now armed with high-grade magic tools and over a thousand spirit stones, Lin Shan was no longer the penniless novice who'd left Yichuan. If the red-faced monk showed up again, Lin Shan would beat him beyond recognition.

Noticing Lin Shan's agitation—standing up, pacing, gnashing his teeth—the Grand Elder hesitated before mentioning another matter.

After calming himself, Lin Shan inquired, only to receive more bad news.

Not only had Princess Guo joined the Cangxuan Sect, but she'd also entangled herself with a true disciple from one of the three great sects—Qianyun Pavilion. This disciple, named Qi Zhong, had pursued Princess Guo even during his time as an inner disciple. After inexplicably becoming a true disciple, Princess Guo had accepted his courtship half a month ago, agreeing to become cultivation partners in the future.

This development shocked Lin Shan. Princess Guo truly had far-reaching connections to attract a true disciple from a major sect like Qianyun Pavilion. Considering her icy beauty, fiery figure, seductive lips, and rare ice-attribute spiritual roots, it wasn't impossible.

What concerned Lin Shan was whether Qi Zhong was at Qi Refinement or Foundation Establishment stage. Regardless, his status likely matched top talents like Lin Fan or Thundercloud Master from the Violet Thunder Sect.

Princess Guo's sudden acceptance of Qi Zhong's courtship after previously refusing was clearly a move against Lin Shan—she couldn't handle him alone, so she sought powerful backing. She would certainly have informed Qi Zhong about their enmity, meaning the true disciple might attack Lin Shan under her instigation.

Aware of Lin Shan's rapid cultivation progress, they might already be preparing to ambush him on his way to Yichuan. Knowing Princess Guo's ruthless decisiveness, having ambushed him twice before, a third attempt was highly probable.

Lin Shan didn't consider himself paranoid—caution was the parent of safety. With Lin Fan gone, encountering a Foundation Establishment cultivator alone would be unpredictable.

"Interesting..." Lin Shan mused. He'd underestimated Princess Guo. First, convincing the imperial elder to help her reach late-stage Qi Refinement, then strategically joining the Cangxuan Sect, and now securing a powerful ally—she was a formidable adversary.

His priority now was returning to Yichuan. Under Left Elder's protection at the auction house, he could focus on reaching Foundation Establishment before dealing with Princess Guo. The plan to bait the red-faced monk would have to wait—better that than risk being ambushed by Qianyun Pavilion's true disciple near Yichuan.

Deciding to act immediately, Lin Shan prepared to depart. Princess Guo likely had spies in the capital, and his appearance at the palace earlier might have already been reported. Demon sect attacks were also a possibility—staying was unwise.

Before leaving, Lin Shan checked on Jiang, now a Nightingale elder, who had accompanied him from Zangke County. Jiang sat cross-legged in his room, cultivating diligently with white mist exhaling from his nostrils—unchanged from when Lin Shan first met him in Zangke County.

Without disturbing him, Lin Shan quietly observed his old acquaintance before slipping away into the night, leaving the capital behind.
