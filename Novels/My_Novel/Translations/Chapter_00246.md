# Chapter 246: The Affectionate Couple, Twin Swords Intertwine

The life-and-death struggle in the forest had taken a turn. Zhang Hu was of a higher realm and possessed greater strength, but his body was crippled and his severe injuries had yet to heal, making him unsuited for single combat.

Li Xian, though of a lower realm and lacking experience, was sharp-witted and incredibly quick to adapt. His Perfect Physique added to his killing momentum, while his Twin Pupils observed for flaws.

As the battle continued, Zhang Hu still held the advantage. If Li Xian seized the right moment and utilized his "Life-Saving Yang Qi" or other hidden cards, he might still be able to escape.

However... Wen Caishang's entry into the formation changed everything. The "Setting Sun and Waning Blood Sword" transformed into the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword," its techniques becoming complete and its power instantly increasing.

The paired swordplay embodied the principles of Yin and Yang, complementing each other and combining their strengths. Li Xian's internal Qi was abundant, but his realm was low. Though his martial arts attainment was at their peak, his ability to evolve them was insufficient.

Take the move "Setting Sun Like Blood," for example. It was inspired by the original owner of the Yang Sword watching the sunset, his emotions stirred as he struck with the lingering light of the setting sun, rich with meaning. Li Xian had practiced it day and night until it was flawless and peerless. However, his physical foundation was slightly lacking, still at the Martial Apprentice level, like a chaotic world of clear and murky mixed together... How could he truly witness the magnificent scenery of "the setting sun hanging in the sky" or "the afterglow like blood"?

This was the "evolution."

With the twin swords combined, their strengths were gathered. When Li Xian施展 "Setting Sun Like Blood" again, he could borrow Wen Caishang's "world" to evoke the scenery of "the setting sun about to hide" and "the afterglow pouring down." When he施展 the sword move again, it naturally changed completely in an instant.

As the sword arc sliced through the air, the sky and earth darkened, as if a thousand zhang of afterglow were shooting towards them, making one feel as if they were watching the sunset. The dazzling scene flashed before their eyes, and by the time they came to their senses, the world was already dark...

Zhang Hu, terrified, hastily dodged. Wen Caishang and Li Xian held hands tightly, Li Xian channeling his internal Qi to her. Wen Caishang immediately executed the move "Full Moon," and the two combined to become "Setting Sun and Full Moon," possessing both the changes of Yin and Yang and the principles of waxing and waning!

Furthermore, both of their attainments were quite profound. Zhang Hu hurriedly blocked, his arms burned and frostbitten, the intense pain unbearable. He was forced back over ten paces.

Their sharp swords met as they thrust forward together. This move was called "Sun and Moon Alternate," a follow-up move of immense power. The sun sets and the moon rises, the sun rises and the moon sets; this is eternal and unchanging through the years. As soon as Li Xian's sword strike ended, Wen Caishang's sword followed, just like the alternation of day and night, never ceasing. Zhang Hu panicked and dodged, not daring to clash head-on.

Wen Caishang fully expressed her sword techniques, casting all her frustration and anger to the back of her mind. She said softly, "Li Lang, kill him." Her words held not a trace of killing intent.

Zhang Hu was enraged, feeling utterly humiliated to be treated as a plaything for their flirtation. He pounded his chest with a thunderous sound and charged forward with brute force. Since his legs were severed, he had become insecure and sensitive. This led him to excel in the art of taming and training tigers, neglecting his own strength.

Now, in his fit of rage, his moves were in disarray. Two fists are no match for four hands. His fists could not defend against their two swords. He felt immensely wronged, wanting only to kill Li Xian. But Wen Caishang, protective of her lover, would surely strike his vitals with ruthless swordplay.

If he tried to grab Wen Caishang, Li Xian's sword force was fierce, tightly guarding them both. They tangled for over a hundred moves in this manner. Zhang Hu was covered in sword wounds, while the two of them felt increasingly intertwined, harboring infinite joy.

It turned out... true feelings needed to be forged by fire. The Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword required tender affection and the entrusting of one's life to the other. Practicing the combined swordplay on ordinary days was ultimately just self-amusement, empty talk on paper. Only when facing a powerful enemy with disaster imminent, when mountains were collapsing and the earth was splitting, and the intention to protect one's partner was sincere and resolute, could the swordplay's infinite power be unleashed, placing them in an invincible position.

Zhang Hu grew more and more terrified as he fought. He suddenly felt his strength gradually declining, actually falling back to the first level of the Martial Dao!

Within the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword was a move called "Swearing an Oath to the Heavens." It was a trick where the Yang Sword master deceived the Yin Sword master into swearing an oath to the heavens, thus restricting their own power.

When used against an enemy, the swordplay revealed the principle of Yin-Yang balance. It turned the situation of "the enemy is strong, I am weak" into "both the enemy and I are weak." The terrifying aspect of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword lay in its "principle of Yin-Yang change."

After taking several sword strikes, Zhang Hu fled in terror. Wen Caishang exclaimed, "Li Lang, don't let him escape!" The two gave chase, but were ultimately a step too slow.

Having driven off the powerful enemy, Wen Caishang said, "We were so eager to escape for our lives, we actually forgot about that move!" Her expression was very pleased. She had never been willing to entrust her life to anyone, but after trying it today, she felt her heart was full, as sweet as honey. Every time Li Xian's sword protected her, she was immensely grateful. As they practiced further, she even felt that her own life was no longer important, and she cared more about the other's feelings.

The true essence of the sword was thought-provoking. She couldn't help but envy the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple: "If I could have such a partner, it seems there would be nothing in the whole world to envy anymore." Her beautiful eyes glanced at Li Xian, and she suddenly felt shy.

Li Xian said, "With our twin swords combined, we don't need to fear Zhang Hu anymore! Let's get on the boat and escape quickly." Wen Caishang's face lit up with joy. Though they had been in peril, they had broken through the danger. She gently pulled Li Xian's hand and said, "Good, good, let's return to the manor. I have a way to remove the gu worm. We can escape to another place and live a good life. If you want to go somewhere to show your might and travel in three to five years, I'll accompany you then."

Wen Caishang said, "Li Lang, I must thank you properly for this journey!" She was very emotional. She valued profit and benefit highly and was incredibly talented. In her life, she was never one to easily be moved or have changes of heart. Even if she was moved, it was shallow and only on the surface. But along the way, their encounters and the combination of their sword techniques had made her feelings grow deeper and deeper.

Having tasted the marrow, her passion surged.

Li Xian laughed, "Why thank me? Besides... you have already been kind to me." His expression was distant, his thoughts in a flurry.

The two made minor repairs and chatted intimately, speaking of the combined sword moves they had just used. He would make a move, she would respond, and they found the details of each move very interesting. Their mindsets and circumstances were completely different now. Though they had brought their sword techniques to their peak, there was still much to be explored.

After Zhang Hu fled, his fear gradually subsided. Recalling the fierce battle, he felt very unconvinced. He muttered to himself, "When they strike with that sword, if I just dodge like this, wouldn't I be able to neutralize it completely?"

He regrouped and searched for the two of them again. Spotting them from afar, he let out a shout and charged once more. This time, the two sides had no more words to say; they drew their swords and fought immediately.

Zhang Hu neutralized several moves but failed to grasp the true principle of the swordplay. He took two stabs to the abdomen and let out a wail as he fled far away again. He now knew that Wen Caishang's internal Qi was completely gone and Li Xian's martial realm was low. Though he had been beaten back several times, he remained unconvinced, still feeling there was an opportunity to be had.

It wasn't long before he attacked again. He didn't expect that this time, the two had improved even faster. As they wielded their swords, they now added a divine charm, and occasionally, one could hear laughter and cheerful chatter. The two seemed to be frolicking and playing, not even putting him in their eyes.

Yet, their moves were terrifyingly powerful. He exhausted all his skills but could do nothing to them, only earning more sword wounds. His strength was formidable, so escaping was always no problem.

Beaten time and again, he was heartbroken. The sound of laughter and chatter lingered in his ears, along with Wen Caishang calling "Li Lang, Li Lang." It stirred his past distracting thoughts. Influenced by the swordplay, he completely forgot about grievances and enmities, feeling only unwillingness.

He suddenly thought, "This is a paired swordplay... Ah! That's it! Why was that小子 Li Xian able to be with Wen Caishang? It's all because of this swordplay. If I kill him and take his place, wouldn't that be better? By then... she would call me 'Zhang Lang, Zhang Lang'..."

Having been defeated three times, he had little confidence. He suddenly saw a wild dog foraging for food in the mountains. He said to himself, "Since I have no tiger or beast, if I were to tame a dog, it could carry me, and my strength would increase by twenty percent."

He then captured the wild dog and found a way to tame it. Zhang Hu's ability to tame beasts was top-notch. His unique method could connect the hearts of man and beast.

He murmured in a low voice, speaking a certain beast language. As he spoke, his entire body's bones trembled lightly, emitting a faint, ethereal sound. The wild dog grew sleepier as it listened and finally fell asleep.

When it woke again, it was already very affectionate towards him. He rode the dog and tracked them again. He found them at night.

He saw the two camping in the wilderness, leaning on each other, intimate and inseparable. When the mood struck, they danced with their swords under the moon. They were using sword techniques, but it looked like flirtatious banter. Li Xian's sword tip flicked, untying the cord of Wen Caishang's clothes. Wen Caishang's sword slanted and划过, loosening the sash of Li Xian's outer robe.

Seeing them grow more and more scantily clad, a sword gleam suddenly flashed towards him. It turned out the two had already noticed him! Zhang Hu immediately counterattacked, coordinating with his dog to施展 martial arts.

Using the dog as a tiger naturally had many drawbacks. After several exchanges, Li Xian's sword stabbed and killed the wild dog. Zhang Hu,牵带 by the sword's force, was in a daze, only instinctively defending. He muttered, "I can practice the sword too, why won't you be with me? Why isn't it me?"

His mind was completely lost. Suddenly, he let out a great wail and fled again. He had changed his heart's meridians between life and death, and his emotions were牵带 by the sword's force... leading him to madness and idiocy.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang, seeing him like this, both felt delighted. Wen Caishang sighed, "I didn't expect such a great enemy to end like this!" She couldn't stop holding Li Xian's hand tighter, her heart filled with sweetness and joy.

Li Xian said, "His delusions entered his heart, and he was ultimately反噬 by them. Pitiable, truly." Wen Caishang said, "Hmph! What's there to pity? If it weren't for my injuries, I would have first cured his madness and idiocy, then properly humiliated him!"

Li Xian asked, "What did he do to offend you in the past?"

"He wanted to offend me?" Wen Caishang said with disdain, "He wasn't qualified."

Li Xian asked, "Then why did you break his legs?"

Wen Caishang said calmly, "He wanted to pursue me. I didn't like it at the time, so I cut off his legs to stop him from chasing me."

Li Xian's heart skipped a beat. He thought, "This Zhang Hu hadn't even offended you, and he ended up so miserable. I've been quite arrogant along the way. Won't my end be even worse?" He asked casually, "What about me? Have I offended you?"

Wen Caishang laughed, "You小子 dare to ask me? Hmph, you're the one who offended me the most. You were rebellious and unfilial, haven't you angered me enough?"

"In the carriage back then, you wouldn't listen to my commands. I remember it all. And you pinched me, teased me... I have it all written down."

Li Xian asked, "Then... how will you treat me?" Wen Caishang's eyes rippled, her passion and desire accumulating, but it was always just one step away from being fulfilled before her mood was interrupted. She said softly, "I will punish you slowly. If you don't obey, I'll cut off your legs too. But... we... we are different from them."

Li Xian thought to himself, "Her words are filled with affection, it's just flirtatious teasing, like a coquette. But it might not be false!" Feeling a surge of courage, he said, "Alright, I'll punish you first, so it's fair."

They bypassed White Tiger City and traveled for another day. The sound of river waves crashing was thunderous. The Wei Hu River flowed ceaselessly, right before their eyes.

Li Xian gazed upon the river and the heavens, and a great ambition suddenly arose within him. Wen Caishang practiced the paired swordplay, contemplating Yin and Yang. She had gradually come to understand the "Marrow-Setting Finger" technique, and her strength was recovering by one or two parts.

Walking along the river for over ten li, they saw a boat dock. Flags fluttered, embroidered with a "Black Turtle."

The nearby four hundred li of river territory had been承包ed by the local powerful family, the Liu family. The Liu family had a long history and a deep foundation. Their family totem was the "Black Xuan Turtle."

Wen Caishang taught him, "Look at those flags. The imperial court is weak, and tax revenues from all regions are difficult to collect. In some places, flying a family flag is more intimidating. This 'Wei Hu Liu Family' is quite formidable; this generation of their family has produced two outstanding talents."

Li Xian said, "In the late stages of a dynasty, families carve up territory. If it evolves further, won't heroes rise up everywhere, vying for control of the divine land?"

Wen Caishang said, "You can have such a foresight, you are very clever. I have read history books extensively, and all dynasties in their late stages have this characteristic. But if a powerful figure were to be born within the imperial family, they might be able to turn the tide."

Li Xian thought that if this were his previous life, once a dynasty reached this point, it would be almost impossible to save. He then thought, "However, this world is vast, with more strange and wondrous events. The general direction of the dynasty's progression should be similar to my previous life. But... it's like the difference between a食精武人 and an ordinary mortal. A食精武人 possesses more possibilities, and so does this Great Wu Dynasty."

They proceeded to the boat dock.

Li Xian found the manager, paid the fare, and booked a spot for the next day. The manager, surnamed Liu, was a branch member of the Wei Hu Liu family. He was straightforward and did not cause any trouble, saying, "At the hour of yin tomorrow, we will not wait for anyone who is late!"

There was a food stall next to the boat dock, offering wine, rice, and vegetables, but the prices were very high. Li Xian had劫 some young masters earlier and still had some money left.

He ordered some small plates of meat and vegetables to restore his energy. Li Xian slightly raised his eyebrows. This allowed Wen Caishang to observe his expression for a moment.

She gave him a captivating glance, her graceful figure moving a step faster. Her sleeve brushed the dust off the table and bench, and she said softly, "Great King Li, please be seated."

"Little Cai, not bad." Li Xian nodded, seeing that the training along the way had been quite effective. It was a bit of revenge for his previous resentment.

The other waiting passengers all stared wide-eyed, filled with envy. They also felt Li Xian was truly detestable, not knowing how to cherish a beauty or value her affection. To treat her with such roughness was simply too much!

Li Xian added, "My burden is so heavy, my shoulders are tired." Wen Caishang was extremely embarrassed, but still said, "I'll help you rub them." Her fair, slender fingers gently kneaded his shoulders.

"You臭小子... just you wait!"
