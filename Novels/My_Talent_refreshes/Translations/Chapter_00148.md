# Chapter 148: Toying with a Qi Condensation Perfected Cultivator, Refusing Fairy Cen

On the high platform of Rainbow Island, Jiang Hongguang and the other two had long been waiting, filled with surprise. As Chu Ning flew onto the platform, Jiang Hongguang's face immediately lit up with joy, saying: "Fellow Daoist Chu, you've truly given us a great surprise! I didn't expect your strength to be so formidable!"

Jiang Lan, standing by, had a slightly flushed face, but her eyes openly met Chu Ning's as she said: "Senior Brother Chu, I was a bit rude to you earlier. This junior apologizes."

Chu Ning smiled slightly upon hearing the siblings' words. "What I said to you all earlier, I haven't gone back on my word. However, there's still another round of challenges tomorrow. It's not too late to celebrate after we win then."

Seeing Chu Ning's calm demeanor, unaffected by praise or criticism, Jiang Hongguang sighed inwardly once more. His previous judgment of Chu Ning gained a few more points of certainty.

At this moment, the other challenges on the arena continued. Although Chu Ning had just defeated three Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivators consecutively, it indeed caused quite a stir. However, as time passed, some Tier 2 island competitions also began. The duels of Foundation Establishment cultivators also drew much discussion from the crowd. Gradually, fewer people remembered Chu Ning's recent duel. Since Rainbow Island had already accepted one challenge today, the final round of challenges was left for tomorrow. Chu Ning and the others could also watch the battles with peace of mind.

When the day's matches concluded, Chu Ning returned to his inn's stone room as usual. Before parting, Jiang Hongguang mentioned that Stone Tablet Island's strength was even greater than Clear Spring Island's. He also asked Chu Ning if there was anything he needed help with. Chu Ning naturally replied that he didn't. Although Jiang Hongguang's cultivation seemed strong among Qi Condensation Layer 8 cultivators, he wouldn't be much help against a Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivator. As for Jiang Hongguang's guess that Stone Tablet Island's island master might have reached Qi Condensation Perfection, Chu Ning wasn't very concerned. Honestly, if he hadn't been afraid of exposing his methods, Chu Ning could have won even more easily against those Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivators today. As for Qi Condensation Perfected cultivators, he had even killed a prodigy disciple like Shang Rui from Qingxi Sect when he was at Qi Condensation Layer 8. However, in such competitions, many of his methods couldn't be used. He did need to ponder how to deal with a Qi Condensation Perfected cultivator, if there was one on the opposing side, while still conserving his strength. That night, Chu Ning didn't cultivate the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art in his stone room, but he wasn't idle either, spending the entire night drawing talismans.

The next morning, Chu Ning appeared in the arena as usual. When Chu Ning appeared, many people remembered his performance from yesterday, and a lot of discussions immediately arose. Chu Ning calmly walked to the high platform of Rainbow Island. Honestly, Chu Ning, who had always preferred to keep a low profile, wasn't very accustomed to being the center of attention. But to find a good foothold, Chu Ning felt rather helpless. On the high platform of Rainbow Island, unlike yesterday's solemn atmosphere, the three members of the Jiang family all wore smiles. They weren't sure if Chu Ning could win today's match again, but at least, even if he lost, someone would pay their three years of tribute.

The process was still the same as the previous two days; the competition quickly began. Today, Rainbow Island's match was scheduled later. The highlight of the morning was an island ranked 25th or 26th challenging the island ranked 15th. Each of the two islands sent a total of eight cultivators, including two Foundation Establishment cultivators from each. The battle was extremely fierce, and in the end, the 15th-ranked island successfully defended its position, causing a commotion in the arena. The subsequent rounds of duels were not particularly outstanding; similar to before, about sixty percent of the challengers won. In a blink of an eye, half the day had passed.

"Next round, Stone Tablet Island challenges Rainbow Island."

Just as everyone thought the matches weren't very exciting, Cen Wenquan's voice rang out from the main stage. Immediately, it caused another stir among the crowd.

"The challenger for Rainbow Island is here! Stone Tablet Island is known as the number one island among Tier 1 spiritual vein islands. They say there are five or more cultivators above Qi Condensation Layer 9, and the island master, Gongsun Lang, is rumored to have reached the Qi Condensation Perfection realm. What do you think? Can Chu Ning, that Qi Condensation Layer 8 cultivator from Rainbow Island, still win today?"

"I doubt it!"

"I think there's a certain probability he could win against a Qi Condensation Layer 9, but for a Qi Condensation Layer 8 to win against a Qi Condensation Perfected, that's too difficult."

"Let's see. If he really can win, that would be the biggest upset in this Thousand Islands Competition."

Unlike yesterday's overwhelming skepticism and mockery towards Chu Ning, when Chu Ning and a Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivator from Stone Tablet Island stepped onto the stage, there were surprisingly many quiet voices of support around. Except for some uncertainty when discussing the possibility of Chu Ning facing a Qi Condensation Perfected cultivator, the support from others was quite significant. And Chu Ning did not disappoint these voices of support. Just like the matches yesterday, although today's cultivator from Stone Tablet Island was clearly more cautious, under Chu Ning's various fire-element spells and talisman attacks, he was still greatly troubled.

Some also tried to launch a preemptive attack to catch Chu Ning off guard. Then, everyone saw that Chu Ning had one top-grade low-tier talisman after another. Under the attack of one Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivator, Chu Ning directly used ten top-grade low-tier defensive talismans consecutively. When attacks were fruitless, once they fell into a passive state, they could only face defeat against Chu Ning's barrage of attacks.

"This person is really a Talisman Master!"

"He has so many top-grade low-tier talismans; his talisman crafting skill must be high!"

As information about Chu Ning spread, everyone's gaze towards him became more serious. A Qi Condensation Layer 8 cultivator who could defeat six Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivators with spells, and was also a top-grade low-tier Talisman Master, would not be easily underestimated by anyone.

"Stone Tablet Island's master is going to make his move himself!"

At this moment, a voice suddenly shouted out. Everyone followed the shout and indeed saw a brocade-robed cultivator fly out from the center of Stone Tablet Island's high platform, landing on the arena. This person was small in stature, wearing a brocade robe, giving off a somewhat comical impression. However, upon seeing this person's cultivation, gasps immediately arose.

"Qi Condensation Perfected!"

"Now this is a good show! Qi Condensation Perfected versus the dark horse Qi Condensation Layer 8!"

"Everyone, let's guess! Will it be Island Master Gongsun Lang, the Qi Condensation Perfected cultivator, or the dark horse Chu Ning who wins!"

"It's definitely Gongsun Lang, after all, he's Qi Condensation Perfected."

"Exactly, no matter how strong a Qi Condensation Layer 8 is, he can't compare to a Qi Condensation Perfected, unless he has some hidden trump card."

In the spectator square below, people were discussing animatedly. And at this moment, on the main stage, the Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Thousand Islands Alliance were also discussing. The elderly Foundation Establishment cultivator who had praised Fairy Cen earlier was the first to speak: "Fellow Daoists, who do you think will win between these two?"

"If this Chu Ning only has these methods, then Gongsun Lang will definitely win. If he has some other methods, the probability of him winning won't exceed thirty percent." A middle-aged cultivator in blue robes, seated on the left, chimed in. "Gongsun Lang's earth-element cultivation methods and spells are exceptionally good, especially his defensive capabilities, which are extremely strong. Even against newly formed Foundation Establishment cultivators, purely in terms of cultivation methods and spells, he can put up a fight." The old man nodded slightly upon hearing this, clearly agreeing with the blue-robed middle-aged cultivator. Another middle-aged cultivator in black robes also echoed: "Indeed! Moreover, there's a two-realm difference between them. This Chu Ning has almost no chance of winning."

"I don't think so necessarily." At this moment, Fairy Cen, clad in flowing white robes, spoke. Among the younger generation, she was the only Foundation Establishment cultivator, and only she could participate in the discussion with the others.

"Oh, Niece Cen, what profound insights do you have? Do you perhaps think that Chu Ning can still win?"

"This niece has no profound insights," Fairy Cen gently smiled, her voice ringing like silver bells. "It's just that since this Qi Condensation Layer 8 Chu Ning dared to come out and challenge, he should have some other methods up his sleeve. Perhaps I'm overthinking it, but I believe the chances of victory for both are fifty-fifty."

"Fifty-fifty! I thought Niece Cen would say that junior Chu would win outright," the old man who spoke first chuckled. "However, even fifty-fifty is quite a high appraisal. Let's just watch."

As everyone chatted, the brocade-robed cultivator cupped his hands towards Chu Ning. "Gongsun Lang of Stone Tablet Island, I've come to seek your guidance, Fellow Daoist Chu."

As the brocade-robed cultivator spoke, Chu Ning had just swallowed a Qi Replenishing Pill. In truth, his spiritual power was still ample at this moment, but he had only displayed Qi Condensation Layer 8 cultivation. After several consecutive battles, if he were still completely at ease, people would definitely find it highly suspicious. Moreover, the opponent was Qi Condensation Perfected, so Chu Ning naturally wouldn't underestimate him. At this moment, Chu Ning's expression became a bit more solemn as he cupped his hands: "Chu Ning of Rainbow Island."

Just as the crowd below had shouted, this Gongsun Lang was indeed a Qi Condensation Perfected cultivator. Chu Ning was very sure that after he had defeated six Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivators within two days, Island Master Gongsun Lang would definitely not be careless. It wouldn't be an easy task to win while still concealing his methods. Indeed, as Cen Wenquan's voice on the high platform declared the start of the match, Island Master Gongsun's figure flickered, and he directly used an evasion art to disappear from his spot, causing the large volley of fireballs Chu Ning unleashed to miss their target.

"Earth Evasion Art?"

Chu Ning suddenly understood in his heart, but his reaction was extremely swift; he suddenly soared into the air. At the same time, a dark shield appeared in his hand, which he then pressed directly half a *zhang* behind where he had originally stood.

"Bang!"

The next moment, faintly, a muffled sound came from underground. Everyone who understood what had happened couldn't help but feel a pang in their heads.

"Chu Ning's reaction speed is too fast!"

On the main stage, Fairy Cen, standing beside Cen Wenquan, had a flicker of surprise in her eyes, and her red lips parted, letting out a soft exclamation. As Foundation Establishment cultivators, they could naturally sense the relatively precise location of Gongsun Lang's evasion art.

But what everyone utterly failed to expect was that Chu Ning could also judge with such accuracy. Using a large shield to directly block Gongsun Lang's breakthrough point, he probably hit him quite hard. Indeed, the next moment, when Gongsun Lang's figure reappeared in a different spot, a large bump conspicuously appeared on his head. Although he quickly dispersed it with spiritual power, many sharp-eyed cultivators still saw it clearly. Coupled with his already slightly comical appearance, it made him look even more ridiculous.

Gongsun Lang's expression was not good at this moment, but he couldn't care about others' gazes anymore. Because just as he burst out of the ground, a sky full of fireballs already came flying rapidly. There were fireballs from Chu Ning's own Spiny Thorn as well as Fire Talismans activated by his left hand. However, when these fireballs reached Gongsun Lang, they were all blocked by a layer of earthen-yellow light shield. Gongsun Lang raised his head at this moment, his face calm. Having cultivated earth-element spells, his strongest aspect was defense. His body once again flew towards Chu Ning using his evasion art, but this time, he didn't burrow underground. At the same time, a hammer-shaped magic tool had appeared in his hand. Judging by its quality, it was clearly not a low-grade item.

However, Chu Ning did not wait for him to approach. While raising a stack of talismans, he activated an evasion talisman in his hand, and his figure already flickered away. At the same time, he raised his left hand again, and immediately, a sky full of fire again flew towards Gongsun Lang. Different from the previous fireballs, these pervasive flames were columns of fire. These were precisely a batch of Scarlet Flame Fire Talismans that Chu Ning had painstakingly crafted last night. He didn't want to sell these fire talismans, fearing they would be associated with the Qingxi Sect. But using them himself was naturally no problem. After all, many fire talismans produce this effect when used.

"This is... a top-grade low-tier talisman?"

Looking at the dozen or so columns of fire flying towards him, Gongsun Lang finally understood. Even though he was Qi Condensation Perfected, he dared not be careless in the face of attacks from over a dozen top-grade low-tier talismans. He stopped, activating his spiritual power to the maximum, making his earth-element shield defense reach its peak.

"Crackle crackle!"

Amidst a burst of fiery light, the shield continuously trembled. Although it ultimately held, its earthen-yellow color was already very faint. Clearly, if Gongsun Lang hadn't stopped and fully strengthened his defense just now, the shield would have certainly been breached. Having withstood a wave of attacks, Gongsun Lang once again evaded towards Chu Ning. But to his frustration, Chu Ning had once again used an evasion talisman of no low grade in advance, dodging away again.

Then, just like before, when he wanted to pursue again, various columns of fire came flying, forcing Gongsun Lang to stop and strengthen his defense. Thus, this scene was continuously playing out in the arena. Outside the arena, everyone was dumbfounded. Although Chu Ning was the one being pursued at this moment, seemingly quite passive, he was neither injured at all, nor was he in a hurry. Aside from the talismans being used in a way that made everyone's hearts ache, there didn't seem to be much loss for him. On the other hand, after five or six back-and-forth exchanges, Gongsun Lang's expression was clearly becoming impatient. He couldn't catch up, couldn't land a hit, and often had to fully activate his defensive shield to defend, consuming a considerable amount of spiritual power. In every way, it felt as though Gongsun Lang was being toyed with by Chu Ning.

At this moment, the situation in the arena remained the same. After Chu Ning evaded, he once again sent out over a dozen columns of fire, which Gongsun Lang defended against. However, at this point, his earthen-yellow shield was clearly not as colored as it was when he first defended, being very close to transparent. Just when everyone thought the previous scenes would repeat again, on the arena, Chu Ning's expression suddenly changed. He suddenly stopped activating evasion talismans and instead chose to leave by riding the wind.

On the arena, seeing this scene, Gongsun Lang's eyes immediately lit up. Without another word, he directly flew towards Chu Ning using his evasion art. Gongsun Lang, relying on his evasion art, was naturally much faster than Chu Ning's wind-riding technique, and quickly approached Chu Ning. At the same time, the hammer he had long held ready in his hand also smashed down towards Chu Ning. Gongsun Lang also didn't forget that Chu Ning still had a dark, shield-shaped high-tier magic tool in his hand. So during the swing, he suddenly changed direction, altering his trajectory. Indeed, he saw the originally dark shield in Chu Ning's hand come up to meet it, but it met nothing. This delighted Gongsun Lang, and the large hammer, glowing with earthen-yellow light, smashed straight down. But what slightly surprised Gongsun Lang was that the magic tool Chu Ning originally held in his right hand had disappeared at this moment, and in his hand, there was a talisman.

The next moment, the talisman in Chu Ning's hand activated. Instantly, a layer of white light shield enveloped Chu Ning's entire body. As the faintly yellow hammer struck, the shield remained completely still, without even a tremor.

"Mid-tier mid-grade defensive talisman?" Gongsun Lang seemed to suddenly realize something, a flash of surprise in his eyes.

The next moment, his expression suddenly changed. Because at the same time, he saw that the dark shield in Chu Ning's other hand had also disappeared. Instead, it had been replaced by several talismans, and before he could react, three golden lights flew out from Chu Ning's hand, heading straight for him. The speed was so fast that Gongsun Lang had no time to dodge. They were indeed several mid-tier low-grade talismans! These were talisman arts that Chu Ning had learned by analyzing talismans purchased from Cloud Sea Pavilion.

At this moment, how could Gongsun Lang still care about activating the hammer? His entire spiritual power surged, reinforcing the already extremely faint defensive shield on his body. Gongsun Lang's earth-element defensive spell was originally very miraculous. Under normal circumstances, even a mid-tier low-grade talisman wouldn't be an issue for him to defend against three or four of them. However, he had consumed a lot of spiritual power earlier, and coupled with the suddenness of the situation, he simply couldn't fully unleash its power. Several rays of light struck the earthen-yellow shield, and instantly, the shield shattered directly. What slightly reassured Gongsun Lang was that, under the buffering effect of the defensive shield, the remaining talisman spells that hit him didn't cause him too much injury. This undoubtedly delighted him, and he was about to gather his spiritual power onto the hammer to launch an attack.

But the next moment, a flaming fist appeared before his eyes. Then, it stopped about a *chi* (Chinese foot) away from his face. The scorching heat of the flames and the quite strong spiritual energy fluctuations immediately made his expression change slightly.

"High-tier magic tool!"

Gongsun Lang could clearly sense the fluctuations of the high-tier magic tool in Chu Ning's hand. He also knew that if Chu Ning hadn't stopped at this moment, he, without any defense, would probably have directly collapsed on the arena. His body rapidly flew backward. Gongsun Lang dispersed the spiritual power gathered on his body, took a deep look at Chu Ning, and then sighed: "I lost!"

"Whoa!!"

Upon hearing Gongsun Lang admit defeat, the entire arena immediately erupted.

"No way! Chu Ning, at Qi Condensation Layer 8, actually defeated Gongsun Lang, a Qi Condensation Perfected cultivator!"

"Where did that Island Master Jiang from Rainbow Island find such a good helper?"

"An upset! A huge upset!"

In the spectator area below, the crowd was in an uproar. And on the main stage, the many Foundation Establishment cultivators looked at each other. It was still the old man who spoke first, who now exclaimed in wonder: "I truly didn't expect Chu Ning to win in the end! We old bones all misjudged, but Niece Cen's insight is truly sharp."

The blue-robed middle-aged cultivator shook his head noncommittally. "He just used so many high-grade talismans to deplete Gongsun Lang's spiritual power. It was merely a trick."

Fairy Cen chuckled softly at this moment, "Uncle Du, although it was a bit of a trick, it was also very clever. Moreover, it's rumored that Fellow Daoist Chu is a Talisman Master himself. In that case, the talismans below mid-tier grade were very likely drawn by him. This is also his inherent strength." As she spoke, Fairy Cen glanced at Chu Ning, who had by now withdrawn his spiritual power. "Just now, Fellow Daoist Chu also concealed a high-tier magic tool. If he hadn't held back at the end, Gongsun Lang would have been severely injured, if not dead."

Hearing Fairy Cen's words, the blue-robed cultivator laughed heartily. "Niece Cen is right; it truly seems the younger generation is to be feared."

Cen Wenquan, who had been listening to everyone's chatter, smiled at this moment, "I'd better announce the results now." As soon as he spoke, everyone immediately stopped talking. And Cen Wenquan's voice quickly spread throughout the entire arena through the barrier.

"In this match, Rainbow Island wins. Island Master Gongsun of Stone Tablet Island, will you send anyone else to challenge?"

Gongsun Lang in the arena hesitated for a moment, looked at the calm-faced Chu Ning in the distance, and finally shook his head, saying: "No more challengers will be sent. In this round of challenges, Stone Tablet Island admits defeat!"

Hearing this, Cen Wenquan immediately announced the results: "In this round of challenges, Rainbow Island wins. Stone Tablet Island is responsible for Rainbow Island's tribute for three years."

After saying this, the arena naturally erupted in another commotion. Amidst this clamor, Chu Ning and Gongsun Lang on the arena both cupped their hands, then flew separately towards their respective island high platforms.

As soon as Gongsun Lang returned to the high platform of Stone Tablet Island, two Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivators immediately came to greet him. One of them, a tall man, hurriedly said: "Island Master, why did you admit defeat? That person clearly used so many talismans and magic tools, even a mid-tier mid-grade defensive talisman. If we had gone up again, we might have directly won."

"That's right, Island Master. And we also saw his trump card. One more match would have been enough," another cultivator immediately chimed in.

Gongsun Lang, however, shook his head, frowning as he said: "The opponent spared my life; that's one reason. The more important reason is... I always felt like this person didn't use his full strength. I'm worried he might have another trump card. If we didn't admit defeat under such circumstances, I'm afraid he might deal heavy blows to you later?"

"Still had reserves?"

"Still had a trump card?"

Upon hearing Gongsun Lang's words, everyone on Stone Tablet Island's high platform instantly looked bewildered. What these few didn't know was that at this moment, Fairy Cen on the main stage also showed a hint of surprise in her eyes. "He still had a trump card? It seems he's not simple at all."

Despite such a great distance, and with a sound-proofing barrier in place, on the main stage, the others clearly showed no reaction. But this Fairy Cen actually directly heard the conversation of the people on Stone Tablet Island. The next moment, the woman's apricot-shaped lips slightly parted, and she sent a message out.

Chu Ning returned to the high platform of Rainbow Island, naturally receiving a warm welcome from the three Jiang family members. The fact that Chu Ning was able to defeat two islands, allowing them to possess a Tier 2 spiritual vein, truly filled them with both shock and joy. However, after Jiang Hongguang and his wife exchanged glances, a hint of worry inevitably appeared in their eyes. Although Chu Ning noticed this, he didn't show any expression. Jiang Lan, on the other hand, looked at Chu Ning with entirely different eyes at this moment. She actively kept asking Chu Ning various questions.

"Senior Brother Chu, did you draw all those talismans?"

"What grade was that last talisman you used? Even that Qi Condensation Perfected island master couldn't break through it?"

"Why is your Fireball Art so powerful? I haven't seen anyone else's Fireball Art that strong."

These incessant questions made Chu Ning's head ache. Fortunately, Jiang Hongguang immediately reprimanded her, and Jiang Lan finally stopped. Chu Ning then sat calmly on the high platform, watching the matches below, quietly waiting for the entire competition to end. In the subsequent matches, there were occasionally a few good duels, which also made Chu Ning and the others watch with great interest.

"Sea Blue Island successfully challenged Purple Thorns Island. This Thousand Islands Competition is officially over!"

Finally, as Cen Wenquan's voice fell, the three-day competition officially concluded. Everyone immediately flew off, using evasion arts. Jiang Hongguang then actively said to Chu Ning, "Fellow Daoist Chu, let's go together."

Chu Ning thought about the spiritual stones he had deposited at the inn earlier, and seeing that the sky was about to grow dark, he shook his head and said: "Fellow Daoist Jiang, you go first. I still have some matters to attend to. I'll head to the island tomorrow."

"Alright, then I shall await Fellow Daoist Chu on the island." Jiang Hongguang cupped his hands. With that, Jiang Hongguang left with the other two.

Chu Ning, after glancing at the retreating figures of the three, descended the high platform on his own, preparing to head towards the inn.

"Senior Chu!"

Just at this moment, a maid-like figure suddenly walked up to Chu Ning. Chu Ning, seeing that the other party was a Qi Condensation Layer 6 cultivator, immediately waved his hand, saying: "Please don't call me Senior. Fellow Daoist will suffice."

The maid smiled, but still spoke: "Senior Chu, my young lady wishes to have a word with Senior Chu. I wonder if Senior is available?"

"Who is your young lady?" Chu Ning's face showed a puzzled expression.

The maid smiled again and said, "The young lady of the Cen family, known as Fairy Cen in these Thousand Lakes and Islands. Fellow Daoist must have heard of her."

"Fairy Cen is looking for me?"

Chu Ning was slightly surprised upon hearing this. Then he frowned slightly, "May I ask what Fairy Cen wishes to see me for?"

The maid shook her head, "The young lady didn't say."

Chu Ning frowned again, then shook his head and said: "Please tell your young lady that I have urgent matters to attend to and it's not convenient."

With that, Chu Ning turned and left directly. What a joke. The number one fairy of the Thousand Lakes and Islands—just hearing her name suggested a lot of trouble. Participating in this Thousand Islands Competition, he had already gone against his original intention by gaining so much attention. If he accidentally got entangled with this fairy, the troubles would likely be endless.

The maid, seeing Chu Ning actually refuse her, and even turn and leave without hesitation, was greatly astonished. "This person actually refused Young Lady's invitation?"

In the brief moment of the maid's astonishment, Chu Ning's figure had already vanished. Seeing this, the maid lightly stamped her foot, then also turned and left.

In the Cen family's shop, Fairy Cen heard the maid's words. Although her veiled face obscured her expression, a look of surprise appeared in her bright eyes. "You mean, Chu Ning refused without hesitation?"

The maid nodded, then pouted and said: "He just asked me what was going on, and when I said I didn't know, he just left. I didn't even get a chance to speak again." As she spoke, the maid couldn't help but mumble: "This person is too rude. Young Lady, you invited him, yet he didn't even give you this much face."

Fairy Cen, upon hearing this, chuckled lightly. "Oh you, I'm not some special person. Why must he come just because I called? Alright, tell the people in the shop that if this Chu Ning comes, let me know."

After speaking, Fairy Cen continued to look at something, no longer speaking. The maid responded with a "yes" and then turned to leave the room. At this point, Fairy Cen, who was regarded as a celestial being by many cultivators in the Thousand Lakes and Islands, finally raised her head again. "This person is indeed quite interesting." Although she had just told her maid that she wasn't special, in fact, she was well aware of her standing in the hearts of the many male cultivators in the Thousand Lakes and Islands. Now, someone actually turned and left upon hearing she wanted to meet, coupled with the various methods Chu Ning displayed in the competition, it truly piqued her curiosity.

Chu Ning was unaware of all this. After returning to his stone room in the inn, he didn't step out. He also knew that he had gained some attention in the past few days of competition. Fortunately, there were many participants in the competition these days, and his actual strength wasn't too high, so his victories had a slight element of cleverness. Chu Ning believed that while he might temporarily become the focus of discussion, it shouldn't be to the extent of being observed for a long time. During this period, as long as he remained inactive in the Thousand Islands and Lakes, he believed that it wouldn't be long before everyone would forget about him. With this mindset, Chu Ning naturally wouldn't go to the rogue cultivator market to show his face.

The next morning, Chu Ning checked out of the stone room at the inn early. After retrieving his spiritual stones, he headed straight for Rainbow Island while there were few people around. Just as Chu Ning was heading to the teleportation array on Thousand Illusions Island, on the other side, by the teleportation array on Rainbow Island, Jiang Hongguang and his wife, Yu Yuanxiu, were waiting.

"Husband, you've adopted such a low posture. What if Fellow Daoist Chu still relies on his superior strength..." Yu Yuanxiu had just begun to speak when Jiang Hongguang immediately waved his hand, signaling her to stop talking. At this moment, Island Master Jiang said with a serious expression: "Wife, we can say these things privately, but never speak like this outside. Without Fellow Daoist Chu, Rainbow Island definitely wouldn't have been saved. My low posture is to tell him that from now on, he makes the decisions on this island." Jiang Hongguang said, glancing in the direction of the teleportation array, before continuing: "I don't think Fellow Daoist Chu is an unreasonable person. It's unlikely he wouldn't tolerate us on the island at all. As for that Tier 2 spiritual vein..." Jiang Hongguang paused here, then continued: "There's enough space nearby to open up two cave dwellings. If Fellow Daoist Chu absolutely needs that much space for his cave dwelling, we can just live in our current one. There won't be any impact."

Yu Yuanxiu lightly nodded upon hearing Jiang Hongguang's words. "I understand. I'll explain the implications clearly to that girl Jiang Lan beforehand."

Jiang Hongguang nodded slightly upon hearing this, his gaze fixed on the teleportation array, no longer speaking. Undoubtedly, the methods Chu Ning displayed during the three days of arena matches had made Island Master Jiang extremely wary. Those Qi Condensation Layer 9 cultivators were nothing in front of Chu Ning, so his Qi Condensation Layer 8 cultivation naturally made him even more easily manipulated. So, after much thought throughout the night, he finally made up his mind to adopt a sufficiently low posture.

Just then, Jiang Hongguang and Yu Yuanxiu suddenly saw a flash of white light on the teleportation array. Upon seeing the figure on the teleportation array, both took a few steps forward, and Jiang Hongguang already spoke with a smile: "Fellow Daoist Chu, you've come quite early."

As soon as Chu Ning emerged from the teleportation array, he saw Jiang Hongguang and his wife, and a hint of surprise appeared on his face. "Fellow Daoist Jiang, are you and your esteemed wife going somewhere?"

"My wife and I are specifically waiting for Fellow Daoist Chu here," Jiang Hongguang immediately shook his head and said.

Chu Ning was slightly taken aback upon hearing this. But he quickly understood roughly what was happening and hurriedly cupped his hands towards Jiang Hongguang, saying: "Fellow Daoist Jiang, you're truly too polite. I have already been here once and know where your cave dwelling is, so I would naturally find my way there."

"It's what we should do, what we should do!" Jiang Hongguang, although he heard the calm and humble tone in Chu Ning's words and secretly breathed a sigh of relief, his own words remained very polite. "If it weren't for Fellow Daoist Chu, we would be busy packing our belongings and moving right now."

Chu Ning listened, then shook his head with a smile, not replying. Jiang Hongguang noticed that Chu Ning didn't want to dwell on such topics, so he immediately asked: "Fellow Daoist Chu, would you like to come to our cave dwelling first for a chat, or go directly to the hidden spiritual vein?"

Chu Ning answered with almost no hesitation: "Let's go directly to the Tier 2 spiritual vein. To tell you the truth, I brought some spiritual plants with me earlier. I haven't found a suitable place, and if I don't plant them soon, these spiritual plants might not survive."

Chu Ning was speaking the truth. If it weren't for him digging up the spiritual plants with a good amount of soil attached, and carefully packaging them using special methods, and along the way, for some spiritual plants that were harder to preserve, he would occasionally take them out and perform the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art, more than half of the spiritual plants in his storage bag would probably have been unsalvageable by now. Jiang Hongguang and his wife heard Chu Ning say this and once again began to lead the way. Then, the three of them flew on the wind while chatting.

After only a short while of travel, Chu Ning directly stopped, then looked at Jiang Hongguang, saying with a wry smile: "Fellow Daoist Jiang, what do you mean by this? Rainbow Island was originally yours, and you invited me here simply as a helper. How did it end up with me having to be the island master?" Saying this, Chu Ning shook his head. Understanding their inner apprehensions, he now said to both of them with a sincere expression: "Fellow Daoist Jiang, I am used to being a carefree wanderer and dedicated to arduous cultivation. I truly have no interest whatsoever in being an island master. The island should remain as it was; I just need to find a place for a cave dwelling. As for that Tier 2 spiritual vein..." Saying this, Chu Ning paused, and Jiang Hongguang and his wife's gazes both fell upon Chu Ning. Although the two had already agreed that if Chu Ning forcibly took the Tier 2 spiritual vein, they would accept it, before the matter was finalized, they undoubtedly still held a glimmer of hope.

Chu Ning saw their concerned gazes and smiled, saying: "I originally wanted to wait until it was confirmed before telling you, but it's fine if we go together now. I suspect there might be more than just the hidden spiritual vein you discovered on this island."

"What?" Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Jiang Hongguang and his wife instantly looked surprised.

Chu Ning then reached into his spirit beast pouch and patted it, releasing Little White. The little fellow immediately jumped onto Chu Ning's shoulder. At this moment, Chu Ning continued: "This spirit beast I raised is quite sensitive to spiritual energy. It discovered another place on this island where the spiritual energy is dense. As for whether it's a hidden spiritual vein, we'll need to investigate it further." As he spoke, Chu Ning then said to the two: "Why don't we go take a look now?"

"Oh, okay, okay." Jiang Hongguang, who had been somewhat stunned, came back to his senses, and then said: "Everything as Fellow Daoist Chu arranges."

Chu Ning didn't say much more at this moment. He immediately patted Little White lightly. The little fellow understood and began to direct the way. The three then continued to fly forward. First, they arrived at the desolate mountain where Chu Ning and Jiang Hongguang's group had been last time. Then, Little White directed them to continue flying forward. They flew all the way to the southwestern direction of the island, almost directly leaving the island. Only then did Little White signal Chu Ning to stop.

"Swallow Peak? Fellow Daoist Chu, are you talking about this place?" Jiang Hongguang looked at the mountain peak, which didn't have particularly abundant spiritual energy, and asked, somewhat bewildered.

"Whether it is or not, we'll only know by digging it open." As he spoke, Chu Ning roughly pinpointed a location, then directly patted another spirit beast pouch. Immediately, an Iron Rock Beast, about the size of a small calf, was released. In the past few months, although the Iron Rock Beast spent most of its time in the spirit beast pouch, Chu Ning still fed it daily. Especially during this past month after entering the Thousand Lakes and Islands, Chu Ning frequently released it to feed it in the stone room. This fellow grew much faster than Little White. After several months of growth, the Iron Rock Beast was already as big as a small calf. Jiang Hongguang and his wife exchanged glances, both surprised by the endless array of things Chu Ning possessed.

"Go, make a tunnel!"

Chu Ning lightly patted the Iron Rock Beast, and it immediately began burrowing into the side of the hill. Then, with Chu Ning's spells assisting in clearing the earth, a passage leading directly into the mountain's belly was quickly excavated. Chu Ning led the way, and the three entered in single file.
