# Chapter 37: The Qingyang Secret Art, Rebirth Mystic Water!

This was unexpected.  

Sister Qingyan was far more formidable than imagined.  

To single-handedly contend with the Heavenly Demon Palace—though not directly—demonstrated her immense strength.  

The Agility Ranking wasn't about competing within one's own realm but encompassed all under heaven. Whether you were an Innate or a Grandmaster, if your speed stood unrivaled, you could claim a spot.  

And here she was—the third fastest in the world.  

A woman with a limp, no less.  

It was enough to shame countless able-bodied individuals.  

This was the first time Dou Changsheng had heard of the "Earth Book."  

But even without knowing its origins, its power was evident. After merely observing it once, Tang Qingyan had attained peerless speed.  

Round and round, the matter circled back to its origin.  

Dou Changsheng sneered inwardly. So many people saw him as a mere pawn, coming to test him with their probing words.  

But what did they know?  

He had no need to investigate the missing military funds.  

Indifference shattered all schemes.  

Just like Lin Daoqi—all that blathering amounted to nothing.  

A single sword strike was far more effective.  

Dou Changsheng raised a hand, cutting off Elder Hongyang's words. "I understand everything you've said, Elder Hongyang."  

"Too much has happened tonight. I need time to think."  

Hongyang Daoist fell silent, his expression betraying a strong urge to say more. But after a deep breath, he suppressed it, exhaled heavily, and turned to leave.  

Once the elder was gone, Dou Changsheng released his grip on his sword hilt. He had intended to rest, but sleep was now out of the question.  

After sitting for a while, he pushed open the door and stepped into the courtyard, gazing at the bright moon hanging in the sky.  

The moonlight was hazy, draping the earth in a silvery veil.  

Dou Changsheng didn't dwell on the *Five Ghosts Transport Technique*, nor did he ponder Tang Qingyan's ties to Southern Chen or whether her journey north represented the Southern Chen court.  

None of that concerned him.  

Standing beneath the moonlight, the sense of alienation grew stronger.  

Even this moon bore strange markings, its glow carrying an otherworldly aura—utterly different from the moon of his homeland.  

This was not his home.  

Whether the Northern Lands or the Great Jin collapsed, he cared little.  

He had no roots here, no network of connections.  

Only when he married and had children would he truly belong to this world.  

Dou Changsheng chuckled wryly at his own sentimentality.  

Raising two fingers, he pointed lightly forward.  

A sword aura flickered to life at his fingertips—pure white and about an inch long.  

With each pulse, the ethereal blade exuded a peculiar resonance.  

Slowly, a melancholic emotion seeped into the sword aura. Just looking at it evoked an unbearable longing for home, a sorrow of being unable to return.  

Dou Changsheng tilted his head back and sighed deeply.  

*The Eleventh Stance of the Infinite Sword Art—Yearning!*  

This sword strike already carried a faint trace of divine intent.  

The Millennium Earth Pearl truly lived up to its reputation as a supreme treasure.  

Since obtaining it, his internal energy had grown stronger by the day, and his mastery of martial techniques had reached unprecedented heights.  

The *Infinite Sword Art*, originally a technique of the Innate True Realm, had been mastered in an astonishingly short time—even surpassing its original form. He had deduced the Tenth Stance, and now, fueled by his longing for home, the Eleventh Stance had taken shape.  

With further refinement, it would be complete.  

The Tenth Stance was comparable to an ordinary Innate Profound Realm technique, but the Eleventh Stance was different—it touched upon divine intent, inching toward the realm of a Divine Marvel Grandmaster.  

Dou Changsheng hadn't intended to delve so deeply into the *Infinite Sword Art*—he had hoped to acquire another martial art.  

But now, it seemed this sword art might evolve into a supreme technique, a Grandmaster-level skill.  

The next steps were clear: refine the sword stance, grasp this divine intent, and expand upon it.  

Ideas flooded his mind, but he forcibly suppressed them.  

Cultivation required steady, step-by-step progress.  

As an honored guest of the Three Suns Sect, Dou Changsheng resided in the finest quarters—those closest to the Qingyang Spring, the sect's most prized treasure.  

The spring water flowed endlessly under the night sky.  

This was the ordinary Qingyang Spring, useful but not the miraculous healing substance they sought. The true treasure was the purified essence extracted from it.  

Thus, the spring itself was left unguarded—though any attempt to steal it would surely be detected.  

Standing by the white jade railing, Dou Changsheng had barely settled when a Daoist with a goatee appeared beside him, gazing at the spring.  

"Legend says the Qingyang Spring emerged when a sage preached the Dao, moved by heaven's will," the Daoist said calmly. "The people, grateful for the sage's teachings, named it Qingyang."  

"But in truth, our founder gathered spiritual energy from all directions, excavated the earth's veins, and drew forth underground water. With secret techniques, he purified it into this spring."  

"The true treasure is the technique—not the water itself."  

"With the technique, one could produce Qingyang water anywhere, so long as the water's spiritual energy is sufficient."  

"But without the sage's blessing, its value diminishes greatly."  

"Hongyang sought you out, didn't he?" the Daoist—Qingyang Daoist—continued with a cold laugh. "He must have told you that I stole the military funds, that Tang Qingyan is no good, that she once visited Three Suns Mountain."  

"He knew you'd met her, so he sowed distrust, hoping you'd side with him instead."  

"Hongyang's background seems clean, but in truth, he once served in the palace, dismissed by his noble patron and sent to our sect—all to steal the Qingyang technique."  

"Ziyang has already betrayed us, serving the Imperial Chancellor as his lackey, selling out sect secrets."  

"And who knows how many disciples harbor ill intentions?"  

"Even my three chief disciples are no saints—they've long been colluding with factions in the capital."  

"All of them covet this technique, a treasure that could enrich a family or even a nation."  

"If not for my modest strength, I'd have died in some ditch long ago."  

"I don't blame Ziyang or my disciples. The Three Suns Sect is too small—it can't satisfy their ambitions."  

"The fault is mine. My talent pales before our founder's. I couldn't protect our legacy."  

"Had I been an Earth Ranking Grandmaster, these snakes and devils wouldn't dare oppose me."  

"This so-called 'missing military funds' scheme is just a ploy to force me to surrender the technique."  

"The Imperial Chancellor and the Shogunate—their ambitions are vast. They need wealth, and the Qingyang water is their prize."  

"*The Qingyang Secret Art, Rebirth Mystic Water!*"  

Qingyang Daoist laughed bitterly, then tossed a vial into Dou Changsheng's hands.  

"This is the Rebirth Mystic Water—the true essence of Qingyang, not that diluted imitation."  

"It is your fortune... and your curse."  

"If I die today, you become the Qingyang heir. Every power hungry for this water will come for you."  

"They'll bribe your disciples, corrupt your family, and force you to surrender the technique."  

"And no matter how you protest, they'll see it as pretense—only tightening the noose."  

"My fate today will be yours tomorrow."  

"*The Crane Soaring the Nine Heavens*—what a grand title. Let's see if he believes you."  

"How I look forward to it!"  

Blood spilled from Qingyang Daoist's lips as he sighed.  

"Blame your own talent."  

"I never planned this, meant to die and take revenge. But now I'll gamble—bet you're the next Demon Master."  

"May all who hound you meet their end by your hand, avenging my sect."  

"One last truth, as compensation for dragging you into this."  

"The missing funds? The young emperor stole them."  

"There never was any real shipment—all a ruse. That's why the evidence vanished so cleanly."  

"Typical of the Liu family—selfish to the core. To consolidate power, he'd plunge the realm into chaos, pit his ministers against each other, and reap the spoils."  

"Live long, and kill them all."  

"I'll be waiting in the Yellow Springs!"  

Misfortune had struck again!
