Chapter 320: Influence

Su Wanqing’s figure had barely vanished at the end of the long street when the roguish smile on Bi Sheng’s face receded like the tide.

He turned to fix Xu Yunfan with a gaze, and a chilling light actually flickered within his turbid, elderly eyes.

He spoke without courtesy; after all, Xu Yunfan had been snatched away by his Senior Brother Bi Yuan, and he naturally harbored resentment in his heart.

"Kid," he said.

His thin, bony fingers stropped the gourd at his waist, his voice carrying a rare coldness.

"Don't think this old Taoist is really here to wipe your ass. Your Master... that good Senior Brother of mine made it clear: unless your life hangs by a thread, this old man shouldn't even lift a finger to block a blow for you."

A night wind whistled between the two, carrying with it shattered roof tiles.

"I originally intended for you to secretly lay out your plans in Yujing for three months..."

The old Taoist slid half a turtle shell from his sleeve; it was carved with hexagrams that Xu Yunfan couldn't understand, but judging by Bi Sheng’s expression, it was clearly not a good omen.

"Who knew you'd cause a commotion on your very first day by shooting an arrow three hundred yards!"

He sighed. "Now, you have truly caught the eye of that Empress. From now on, every move you make will likely be watched by many."

Xu Yunfan’s *Imprint* technique hadn't dissipated, allowing him to clearly sense the terrifying aura dormant within Bi Sheng.

That was no mere pressure of the Ninth Realm; it was the presence of someone who had undergone multiple breakthroughs and walked extremely far into the Ninth Realm.

He suddenly realized that when this Senior Brother had clashed with Su Wanqing earlier, he likely hadn't used his full strength—perhaps not even eighty percent of it.

"I understand, Senior Brother. I will be careful in the future. As for that waterside pavilion, I specifically chose its location; there should still be survivors."

Bi Sheng snorted through his nose, exhaling two streams of white vapor. The moment the breath left his body, it transformed into two distinct ripples of air that spread rapidly, causing the blood and energy of the hidden onlookers nearby to churn violently.

"Not completely stupid, at least."

Bi Yuan waved his hand dismissively.

"Remember, those in Yujing who want you dead... are not limited to the Celestial Pivot Gate."

Bi Sheng’s figure dissipated into the night like smoke. Xu Yunfan watched the empty street corner and shook his head slightly.

The old man had cultivated the *Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock* to perfection, and his lightness technique had reached the realm of "walking on snow without leaving a trace, riding the wind to travel." It was not surprising that he came and went without a trace.

In the Ninth Realm of Qi refinement, once劲力 (Jinli) transforms into True Qi, the methods of combat become completely distinct from ordinary martial artists, which is truly shocking.

Although Bi Sheng and Su Wanqing had intentionally controlled the shockwaves of their earlier battle to prevent them from spreading, one could still see the terrifying power of a supreme Grandmaster of Qi refinement in the Ninth Realm.

He turned to look at the trembling Daozong disciples, led by Chen Hong. Since the battle began, these few had huddled in the corner, not daring to even breathe loudly. Now, seeing Xu Yunfan’s gaze sweep over, they trembled in unison.

"S-Senior Brother..." Chen Hong’s Adam's apple bobbed, cold sweat beading on his temples.

Xu Yunfan casually tossed over a heavy brocade pouch; the sound of gold and stone clashing inside was crisp and pleasant.

"Take this. Aside from the red gold, there are several dozen thousand taels of silver notes inside; it should be enough. Compensate everyone at double the amount."

He paused, then added meaningfully, "Especially the households next to the Changfeng Tavern, remember to say a few good words."

After all, aside from the roof tiles shattered along the path of the arrow he had shot into the sky with the *Sky-Piercing Cloud Bow*, those few houses had suffered the most severe damage.

After giving his instructions, Xu Yunfan’s figure flashed, moving like a ghost toward the half-collapsed waterside pavilion three hundred yards away.

Running the *Ten Extremities Martial Art*, he arrived in just a few breaths.

By the pavilion, he clearly sensed a faint breath beneath the rubble, flickering like a candle in the wind—it was indeed that brocade-clad youth.

*Boom!*

Xu Yunfan slapped away a broken crossbeam, revealing the dying youth beneath.

The youth's fine robes were soaked in blood, but the jade pendant at his waist remained as lustrous as ever—it was the "Frost Jade Token," the token of an inner disciple of the Sword Pavilion.

Most eye-catching was the emerald phosphorus chain wrapped around his right wrist; it was currently writhing strangely, as if trying to钻入 (burrow into) his flesh.

"Demon organ?!"

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows, genuinely surprised that this person could use a demon organ for protection. It was truly an eye-opener.

He hooked his five fingers like claws onto the youth's Tianling Gai (top of the head), and his Pure Yang True Qi penetrated the body, forcibly suppressing the writhing chain.

The youth suddenly opened his eyes; his pupils had turned an eerie emerald color. "You... have no idea who you've provoked..."

Before he finished speaking, three dark blue needles shot out from his mouth!

*Clang!*

The Dragon Scale Armor automatically protected its master. The scales fluttered, spitting out wisps of red energy that knocked all the poison needles down.

Xu Yunfan remained calm. He pointed like a sword and struck the Tanzhong Acupoint. Three layers of hidden force from the *Ten Extremities Martial Art* exploded consecutively. The youth shook as if struck by lightning and passed out completely.

"Bring him back to the base," Xu Yunfan instructed the arriving Daozong disciples as he lifted the youth as easily as a sack. "Use the Sect's 'Eight Treasures Soul-Suppressing Nails' to lock his limbs, then... hmm?"

He suddenly turned his head to look at the end of the long street.

A faint vibration transmitted from the ground; at least three hundred armored soldiers were rushing this way, yet the sound of their hooves was eerily silent.

"The Imperial City Division's 'Silent Destruction Horseshoes'..."

A nearby Daozong disciple couldn't help but sneer upon seeing this.

"These hounds have learned their lesson; they've learned to time their arrival, showing up fashionably late."

By the time the first squad of black-armored Imperial Guards turned the corner, Xu Yunfan and the others had already vanished without a trace.

Only amidst the wreckage, the black steel arrow still embedded in the blue flagstones continued to hum and vibrate, shining brilliantly in the rising sun.

The squadron leader stared at the arrow with a livid face, not even daring to reach out and pull it out.

The deputy commander behind him whispered, "Sir, these Daozong disciples committed violence in the streets. Should we..."

"Shut up!"

The squadron leader gritted his teeth. "How could such matters be decided by the likes of us? Report to the Commander immediately..."

The squadron leader's gaze lingered for a moment on the direction of the Daozong base, and his Adam's apple bobbed unconsciously.

He slowly retracted his line of sight, lowering his voice as if afraid the night wind might overhear: "Just say... the ironclad evidence of the Sword Pavilion colluding with the Celestial Pivot Gate has already been snatched by someone else."

"This..."

The deputy commander's pupils contracted sharply, his hand gripping the hilt of his sword tightening abruptly. "Sir, we have no evidence. Aren't we essentially..."

He swallowed, not daring to say the word "framing."

The squadron leader suddenly turned his head; the eyes beneath his iron mask glinted with a shrewd light in the moonlight. He reached out to grip the deputy commander's shoulder, the玄铁 (black iron) vambrace clinking against the pauldron. "Remember, we serve the Great Zhou Imperial Court."

His fingers unconsciously tightened. "The more fiercely these martial sects fight among themselves, the more peacefully the high officials in the court... can sleep."

The deputy commander was about to nod when he suddenly spotted the Daozong disciples counting out compensation in the distance. The "Xuan" character tokens hanging at their waists flickered in the torchlight. The two sides were clearly distinct, treating each other as if they were air.

He hesitated for a moment, leaning close to the squadron leader's ear: "But I just received a report. The brocade-clad youth Xu Yunfan took away... seems to be the Third Young Master of the Prince of Mu's estate."

"What?!"

The color instantly drained from the squadron leader's face beneath the mask.
