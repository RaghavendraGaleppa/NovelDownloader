# Chapter 16: Purchasing a Magical Artifact  

"Then, Fellow Daoist, please follow me to the second floor. The high-grade magical artifacts are displayed there."  

"Much obliged!"  

"How may I address you, Fellow Daoist?"  

The attendant, named Qing'er, led Qin Chong upstairs while engaging him in conversation, careful not to appear neglectful.  

"My surname is Qin."  

"So it's Fellow Daoist Qin. You may call me Qing'er."  

The second floor was smaller than the first, occupying only about half the space, but the furnishings and decorations were more refined and exquisite. There were also noticeably fewer customers.  

"By the way, Fellow Daoist Qin, do you have any other requirements for the magical artifact?" Qing'er inquired.  

"Ah, preferably an earth-attribute artifact, with the strongest offensive power possible."  

"I see. Fellow Daoist Qin, please look this way."  

Qing'er then guided Qin Chong to a display case that exuded a dense earthy aura.  

"This one is called the Mountain-Shattering Sword, a high-grade earth-attribute magical artifact. Once fully activated, its power is immense. The primary material used in its forging is Yellow Crystal Stone, making it exceptionally sturdy and resistant to damage."  

As she spoke, Qing'er handed the sword to Qin Chong for inspection.  

The sword appeared to be only about a foot long and quite thin, but upon holding it, Qin Chong was surprised by its weight. Caught off guard, his body instinctively bent slightly before he steadied himself.  

He then attempted to channel his spiritual energy into the sword to activate it. However, even after pouring in a tenth of his mana, the Mountain-Shattering Sword showed little reaction, merely vibrating slightly and expanding to twice its original size.  

Seeing this, Qin Chong gave up on further activation, his expression turning slightly grave.  

"This artifact's power is indeed formidable, but it seems far too mana-consuming."  

"*Giggle*, Fellow Daoist Qin, high-grade magical artifacts are typically designed for late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators. Given your current cultivation level, activating it would naturally be quite strenuous—especially since you requested an artifact with greater power."  

"I’m well aware of that. I’m purchasing it now in preparation for the future."  

"In that case, Fellow Daoist Qin, why not try this Earth-Cleaving Blade? Its primary material is Profound Earth Essence, and its power is quite impressive—only slightly inferior to the Mountain-Shattering Sword."  

"Blade-type artifacts are quite rare, but this one appears to be exquisitely crafted."  

This time, Qin Chong braced himself beforehand. The Earth-Cleaving Blade was just as heavy as the Mountain-Shattering Sword, but after testing it, he still wasn’t entirely satisfied.  

Qing'er then showed Qin Chong several other high-grade artifacts, but none met his expectations.  

By now, Qing'er was growing anxious. She had finally encountered a big sale, and if it fell through, her promotion bonus would be lost. Yet this young man, who looked like a mere boy, remained completely indifferent to her flirtatious glances. *How infuriating!*  

But outwardly, Qing'er dared not offend a customer—doing so would bring her no benefit and might even cause trouble.  

Suddenly, her eyes lit up with an idea.  

"Fellow Daoist Qin, please wait a moment. I’ll fetch a treasure from our store’s collection. I’m certain you’ll be satisfied." With that, she turned and swayed her slender waist as she left the second-floor hall.  

"A treasure from the store’s collection?"  

Qin Chong was skeptical. Given the scale of this shop, how could he possibly afford such a prized artifact? It was likely just old stock that hadn’t sold for years—did they really take him for a fool?  

Still, there was no harm in looking. Whether he’d buy it or not would depend on what he saw.  

A short while later, Qing'er returned, carefully carrying a three-foot-long exquisite wooden box. She slowly opened it before Qin Chong, revealing a dazzling glow.  

Inside was a spear-shaped artifact! Its entire body was earthen yellow, and the aura it emitted was extraordinary.  

"The Four Symbols Rotating Spear—a high-grade set artifact. Though it appears no different from an ordinary spear now, once activated to a certain degree, three additional spearheads will emerge, capable of detaching from the shaft to attack independently."  

The spear was incredibly heavy, far surpassing the Mountain-Shattering Sword and Earth-Cleaving Blade.  

Strangely, however, Qin Chong found that it consumed much less mana when he channeled his energy into it. He surmised that the mana drain would only increase when the set artifact’s full attack potential was unleashed.  

"Fellow Daoist Qin, if this one still doesn’t satisfy you, I truly have nothing else to offer."  

"Hmm, this one isn’t bad. At the very least, the mana consumption is much lower. I can accept it." Qin Chong’s expression remained neutral, betraying neither joy nor disappointment.  

"I’m glad you’re satisfied. This artifact is priced at 2,500 low-grade spirit stones."  

"How much?" Qin Chong was stunned.  

"Two thousand five hundred low-grade spirit stones," Qing'er repeated.  

"Fellow Daoist Qing'er, surely your esteemed shop isn’t trying to swindle me? A high-grade artifact for 2,500 spirit stones?"  

"Of course not! Fellow Daoist Qin, this is a set artifact—it’s truly worth the price."  

"Though I’m not well-versed in artifact forging, I could sense some flaws when testing it earlier. Moreover, it’s clear this artifact was removed from display because it was hard to sell. The price is indeed too high."  

A dark line formed on Qing'er’s forehead. *This brat is far too shrewd—not willing to suffer the slightest loss. What a tough customer!*  

"Then what price would you suggest? The cost of forging a high-grade artifact is no trivial matter."  

"How about this—in consideration of the Azure Cloud Pavilion’s reputation, I’ll offer 1,500 spirit stones."  

"1,500? Impossible. The lowest I can go is 2,300."  

"1,500!"  

After some haggling, they finally settled on 1,800 low-grade spirit stones.  

Just as Qing'er eagerly awaited Qin Chong’s payment, he added, "I don’t have that many spirit stones on me. I’d like to exchange some materials for spirit stones first before completing the transaction."  

"Ahem… What rare materials does Fellow Daoist Qin wish to trade?"  

"A mature Blood Spirit Fruit, a hundred years old."  

"Blood Spirit Fruit? A century-old mature one?"  

"Correct!"  

"Such a transaction is beyond my authority. Please accompany me to see Master Qi. After his appraisal, we can proceed."  

"Lead the way."  

By now, Qing'er had lost much of her initial enthusiasm, but she had no choice but to see the deal through.  

Inside an elegantly decorated chamber, Qin Chong met an elder.  

The man was tall and broad-shouldered, with white hair and beard, yet his complexion was ruddy and full of vitality. His kindly expression was paired with an unexpected revelation—he was a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

"Qing'er, you may leave. I’ll handle things from here."  

With a graceful bow, Qing'er placed the wooden box containing the Four Symbols Rotating Spear on the table and exited the chamber.  

"This junior greets Senior Qi!" Qin Chong promptly bowed in respect.  

"So, you’re the young friend Qin with the century-old Blood Spirit Fruit? Let me take a look."  

"Indeed, Senior. Please examine it." Qin Chong handed over the fruit.  

"*Tsk tsk*, not bad, not bad. It must have matured not long ago—the spiritual energy is well preserved," Master Qi murmured to himself as he inspected it.  

"For someone of your cultivation level to obtain such a Blood Spirit Fruit is no small feat. How about this—I’ll round it up. Our Azure Cloud Pavilion will purchase this for 3,000 spirit stones. Does that suit you, young friend Qin?"  

The offer brought a surge of delight to Qin Chong’s heart. He had estimated it would fetch no more than 2,500.
