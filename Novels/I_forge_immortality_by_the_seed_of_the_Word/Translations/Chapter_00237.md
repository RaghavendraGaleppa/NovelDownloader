**Chapter 235: Grand Witch Xuangang**

At the peak of Nether Lung Mountain.

The divine flames, perpetually boiling year-round, solidified into tangible form, scorching the void until it incessantly twisted.

Suddenly, Lou Buyi’s tall figure appeared on the mountaintop. His hands clasped behind his back, his gaze fixed on the bronze divine light streaking across the sky. A profound expression settled on his face.

“Post-natal Purple Qi? This Junior Brother Zhang Jing, he has some interesting things indeed.”

“Later, perhaps…”

His voice trailed off, until it was drowned out by the ferocious roar of the raging divine flames.

…

At the same time, within the bronze divine light.

“Junior Brother, how much of this precious stuff, Post-natal Purple Qi, do you actually have on hand?” Feng Wuyu looked at Zhang Jing beside him with a complex gaze. Even now, a lingering sense of shock remained on his face.

Post-natal Purple Qi, at first glance, didn't seem expensive, but that was when calculated in strands. However, this Junior Brother had just casually offered ten strands, which truly stunned him.

Hearing this, Zhang Jing smiled faintly and immediately explained, “Senior Brother, I have a secret method to condense Post-natal Purple Qi, so for me, this isn’t particularly valuable. Of course, my current strength is limited, so I don't have much on hand. Just now, I was merely making an offer. If that Senior Brother Lou had agreed, I would have found a way to gather it slowly later.”

As he spoke, a hint of disappointment flashed in his eyes. It was a pity that Senior Brother Lou hadn't budged just now. Otherwise—

Zhang Jing had wanted to continue raising the price, but ten strands of Post-natal Purple Qi were almost his limit at the moment. After all, just these would take him decades of effort in the future. This was even considering that he had factored in his future cultivation advancement, the expansion of his Mind-Intent Golden Sun's coverage, and the accelerated condensation of Post-natal Purple Qi. Any more than that would be more trouble than it was worth.

On the other side, Feng Wuyu’s eyes flashed. “Is that so?” he asked, then said with expectation, “Then, Junior Brother, if you condense any extra Post-natal Purple Qi in the future, remember to save some for me. You can name your price; I promise not to haggle, haha.”

After speaking, he suddenly realized something and frowned slightly. “If Lou Buyi won't do it, then Junior Brother, your plan to refine a magical treasure blade embryo with that Innate Blood Gold Essence might have to be shelved for now. Or, you could ask Master. If His Elder takes action, then nothing will be a problem.”

“No need, Senior Brother. I’ll think of another way,” Zhang Jing forced a smile, comforting him. A contemplative look flashed in his eyes. He had actually considered this situation before.

“So now I can only follow the second method from the inheritance, which is to directly nourish it with the saber intent of the Grand Supreme Crimson Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade. It's just that the time required will be too long.” Zhang Jing thought to himself.

As for asking his Master, that method was indeed the simplest and quickest. But the thought only lingered in his mind for a moment before being dismissed. On one hand, whether he could even find his Master right now was a question. Furthermore… Zhang Jing didn't even need to think. If even such a small matter required him to seek out his Master, how could his impression in Master's eyes remain good? This act would be akin to picking up sesame seeds and losing a watermelon!

…

Two days later, a streak of light flashed across the sky, then directly plunged into the Spirit Pivot Mountain Secret Realm.

Within the Daoist temple.

“Strange, why is the temple so quiet today? Could something have happened?” A hint of surprise flashed in Zhang Jing’s eyes. He vaguely sensed something was amiss.

However, he immediately reconsidered. This was, after all, Azure Heaven Profound Brightness, the驻地 of the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect, and also within the scope of the Flowing Light Immortal Realm. Countless Daoist mighty figures were hidden within; what kind of accident could possibly occur? Moreover, the temple had Han Sheng in the Dao Integration Realm, and the Yin-Yang Dual Polarity Dust Grand Formation was constantly operating. Unless attacked by an Earth Immortal, or even a Carefree Celestial Immortal, the temple could not possibly be in danger. And cultivators who had reached Earth Immortal and above, even if they went mad, would never actively attack the Daoist temple of a true disciple. After all, such an act would be a complete slap in the Grand Unity Dao Sect’s face. As for demonic beasts—the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect practiced non-interference, but non-interference didn’t mean they didn’t care about anything.

As he watched the main hall of the temple’s main peak draw nearer, Zhang Jing’s heart relaxed slightly. However, in the very next instant, he suddenly felt his vision go dark, and he abruptly lost consciousness.

…

Who knew how much time had passed. Zhang Jing slowly regained consciousness. His chaotic awareness began to recover little by little, and faint streaks of light gradually appeared in his pitch-black vision.

“All my uncles…” A faint, indistinct voice reached his ears, too blurry to make out clearly.

“Where am I?” A trace of confusion flashed in Zhang Jing’s eyes.

Then, he gently lifted his eyelids and found a dark-skinned, powerfully built man sitting opposite him. His muscles bulged, exuding a terrifying sense of strength. This man's cultivation was clearly only at the Foundation Establishment stage, yet he subtly gave Zhang Jing an indescribable sense of terrible danger, as if an ancient fiend slumbered within his body. With just a glance, Zhang Jing perceived a deep, rebellious demonic nature from this figure, a will to battle heaven and earth, as if a single strike would turn the world upside down.

“Uncle Zhang, what exactly happened at my brother’s house that day? What did you see, what did you hear? Please tell me everything!”

Just as Zhang Jing was pondering, he heard the man opposite him suddenly ask. Immediately, Zhang Jing felt a fierce, primal gaze fall upon him, pressing down so hard that he couldn't move. Moreover, as the words fell, the terrifying demonic aura on the figure opposite him grew at an extremely exaggerated rate.

In his seat, Zhang Jing was stunned. Uncle Zhang… was this person referring to him? He couldn't help but lower his head, and his eyes flashed. Only now did Zhang Jing notice that his clothes had, at some point, changed into a coarse gray robe, looking incredibly worn.

“Second Master Wu, you are a cultivator; why bother with a mere mortal like me? I truly didn't lie to you; your esteemed brother really died of illness. Everyone knows this. Don't you agree, Uncle Zhang?” To his right, a middle-aged man said with a terrified expression, not forgetting to drag Zhang Jing into it.

The words reached his ears, and Zhang Jing was startled. Second Master Wu? The brother who died of illness… He couldn't help but glance at the faces of the other few people seated around the table. A beautiful, pale, and haggard young woman suddenly came into view. Beside her was an old woman of sixty, looking restless.

This scene. Zhang Jing found it strangely familiar no matter how he looked at it.

“Crap! So Wu Dalang still died, and why did I inexplicably become an extra? Wait, does that mean the colossal demon sitting opposite me is Wu Song?” His mind was filled with bewilderment.

…

Half an hour later.

*Shasha—*

Zhang Jing walked step by step along the desolate, dilapidated street. Everything in his sight had become completely different from when he left. Or rather, the entire vast San’yuan City, with a population numbering in the hundreds of millions, had now been entirely replaced by some entity using a heaven-defying method, transformed into a massive stage.

He unconsciously looked up. A strange star, shimmering with dark red demonic light, hung high in the sky, silently replacing the sun.

“This is interesting. Such a thing can happen right under the noses of the Grand Unity Dao Sect’s mighty figures?” Thinking this, Zhang Jing's heart stirred. From between his eyebrows, a chaotic Dao Seal, suffused with purple light, slowly emerged. In an instant, he sensed the existence of the Flowing Light Immortal Realm.

“Good, being able to sense the Flowing Light Immortal Realm means that the entity behind this place has not, or cannot, completely isolate the power of the Dao Sect.” A strange sense of calm settled in Zhang Jing’s heart.

…

Half a month passed in a flash. Zhang Jing, hidden in this Yanggu County town, finally witnessed the rise and fall of a grand play with his own eyes. Unfortunately, his 'identity' was too ordinary. Apart from his initial involvement, he could only act as a bystander at other times. Sometimes he couldn’t even spectate, only able to hear verbal accounts from others.

This day, on the street, Zhang Jing slowly stopped, his gaze suddenly fixed on the tall, imposing man who had abruptly appeared before him, standing a full three *zhang* (approx. 9 meters) high. The man had two small snakes, one gold and one silver, piercing each of his ears. His entire body exuded a desolate, primordial aura from ancient wilderness.

The two stood facing each other. The atmosphere was incredibly still. The hurried passers-by around them, however, seemed oblivious to this bizarre sight, as if they couldn’t see it at all.

After a short while, the burly man grinned. “Tsk, kid, where did you hide those thirty-six Nine Stars Heavenly Gang Dao Steles?”

Hearing this, Zhang Jing suddenly realized and immediately bowed. “Zhang Jing, a true disciple of the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect, greets Senior. May I ask Senior’s esteemed name?”

“I am Grand Witch Xuangang of the Jiuli Realm!”

“Kid, don’t try to pressure me with your paltry Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect. Quick, tell me, where are those thirty-six Nine Stars Heavenly Gang Steles now?”
