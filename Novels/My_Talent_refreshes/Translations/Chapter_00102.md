# Chapter 102: Tens of Thousands of Spirit Stones and Spirit Stone Jade Talismans

It was no wonder the female cultivator was so surprised; Chu Ning had simply taken out too many talismans.

Chu Ning had divided them into two piles: Primary-grade High-quality Talismans and Primary-grade Mid-quality Talismans. Each stack appeared to contain several hundred talismans.

These were, naturally, what Chu Ning had accumulated during this period. He had over 800 Primary-grade Mid-quality Talismans. As for Primary-grade High-quality Talismans, after a last-minute batch produced yesterday, he now had 450.

At this moment, the female cultivator, surnamed Zhang, finally understood why Chu Ning had asked about the confidentiality of his identity earlier. After all, the combined value of these talismans was not insignificant.

She casually picked up a Primary-grade High-quality Streamer Ice Shield Talisman, a hint of astonishment flashing in her eyes. "Such high-quality defensive talismans."

If defensive talismans, which were harder to draw, possessed such quality, she knew without a doubt that the other talismans must be of similar caliber.

Ms. Zhang looked up at Chu Ning, her eyes full of smiles, and said, "I hadn't expected, Fellow Daoist Li, that you are actually a Primary-grade High-quality Talisman Master."

To be able to produce so many talismans at once, Ms. Zhang knew without thinking that these talismans must have been drawn by the cultivator before her. And to be capable of producing such high-quality Primary-grade High-quality Talismans, he was undoubtedly a Primary-grade High-quality Talisman Master.

Hearing Ms. Zhang's words, Chu Ning frowned slightly, his expression betraying a hint of displeasure. Ms. Zhang quickly realized her misstep and immediately said apologetically, "This concubine was presumptuous."

With that, she swiftly composed herself and began counting the talismans Chu Ning had placed on the table.

"One hundred forty each of Yin Lightning Talismans, Adamant Talismans, Concealment Talismans, Earth Evasion Talismans, Beast Trapping Talismans, and Clear Wind Talismans. One hundred fifty each of Crimson Flame Talismans, Cloud Soaring Talismans, and Streamer Ice Shield Talismans."

Ms. Zhang swiftly reported the quantities, then looked at Chu Ning. "Fellow Daoist, please confirm if the quantities are correct."

"Yes, no problem," Chu Ning responded.

A smile reappeared on Ms. Zhang's face. "Fellow Daoist Li's talismans are all of very high quality and in large quantities. I can raise the prices appropriately. Yin Lightning Talismans, Concealment Talismans, and Clear Wind Talismans will be calculated at four hundred ninety lower-grade spirit stones each. Earth Evasion Talismans and Beast Trapping Talismans will be five hundred eighty-eight lower-grade spirit stones each. Adamant Talismans will be six hundred eighty-six lower-grade spirit stones."

After Ms. Zhang quoted these prices, Chu Ning quickly calculated in his mind and found that the price she offered was about seventy percent of what he would sell them for himself. Chu Ning didn't feel too much of a loss, as it was unknown how long it would take to sell these talismans if they were kept at his own Spirit Talisman Workshop.

He listened on calmly as Ms. Zhang pointed to the Primary-grade High-quality Talismans Chu Ning had brought. "For these Primary-grade High-quality Talismans, I can offer an even higher price. Crimson Flame Talismans and Cloud Soaring Talismans will be sixteen spirit stones each, totaling two thousand four hundred spirit stones. Streamer Ice Shield Talismans will be twenty spirit stones each, totaling three thousand spirit stones."

Chu Ning calculated again. These Primary-grade High-quality Talismans were being calculated at eighty percent of his retail price. This percentage was indeed higher. However, losing five spirit stones per talisman still made his heart ache a little.

With a slight thought, Chu Ning directly took back the four hundred fifty Primary-grade High-quality Talismans. "Then I'll just sell these Primary-grade Mid-quality Talismans."

Ms. Zhang immediately said, "Please wait, Fellow Daoist Li, what is the meaning of this?"

Chu Ning glanced at her, then slowly began, "You're making five spirit stones per talisman from me. This price is too heavily suppressed."

Ms. Zhang maintained her smile. "Fellow Daoist Li, looking purely at the spirit stones, it might seem less, but in terms of value, I'm offering ten percent more than for the Primary-grade Mid-quality Talismans."

"But these Primary-grade High-quality Talismans must sell even better than the Primary-grade Mid-quality ones here at your Cloudsea Pavilion, right? Moreover, my talismans' quality, even here, I believe is top-tier. Seventeen spirit stones each for Crimson Flame Talismans and Cloud Soaring Talismans, and twenty-two spirit stones each for Streamer Ice Shield Talismans. If you can accept these, I'll sell."

As Chu Ning spoke, Ms. Zhang's face revealed a wry smile. "Fellow Daoist Li is truly a shrewd negotiator. This... Alright, this matter would usually need approval from a senior in the Pavilion, but I shall take the liberty to agree."

Ms. Zhang finished speaking and immediately began calculating. "One thousand lower-grade spirit stones for the monster materials, one thousand seven hundred sixty-four lower-grade spirit stones for the mid-grade talismans, and eight thousand four hundred lower-grade spirit stones for the high-grade talismans. That's a total of eleven thousand one hundred sixty-four lower-grade spirit stones."

"Over ten thousand spirit stones!" Chu Ning secretly exclaimed, a sense of satisfaction welling up in his heart.

He still had some other items he could sell, such as the few magic tools he had obtained from Liu Laoda and his group, and the Earth Spirit Crystal he got from the Blood-Spotted Uniped Ape's cave, as well as the three Seven-Star Spirit Fruits he had remaining after consuming some. However, these items were either too sensitive to deal with, or, like the Earth Spirit Crystal, he wanted to keep them for potential future use. So, for now, Chu Ning had to let go of the idea. Otherwise, if all these were added together, he could have gotten even more.

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, Ms. Zhang's smiling voice rang out again. "Fellow Daoist Li, as for these spirit stones, would you prefer them directly now, or would you like to buy items first?"

"I'll buy items first," Chu Ning immediately replied. The reason he came to Wind Gorge Market, besides selling these talismans, was to purchase some urgently needed items.

Ms. Zhang smiled enchantingly. "Very well, Fellow Daoist. Please state your needs, and this concubine will arrange for them to be brought to you immediately."

Chu Ning had already planned his visit to Cloudsea Pavilion. He immediately stated the first item he wished to purchase. "Does your Cloudsea Pavilion have pills similar to Yuan Gathering Pills, but suitable for late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators?"

Ms. Zhang swiftly answered, "Yes, we have Spirit Yuan Pills, suitable for late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators. They come in bottles of ten pills, at two hundred spirit stones per bottle."

Chu Ning listened, then calmly said, "I'll take fifteen bottles of Spirit Yuan Pills."

"Understood," Ms. Zhang replied, writing something on a piece of paper. She placed it into a round hole on the desktop, then pressed a button, and the paper was immediately transmitted away. She then continued to look at Chu Ning. "Does Fellow Daoist need anything else?"

Chu Ning glanced at the desktop in front of her; he wasn't too surprised. He had seen similar mechanisms during the Cloudsea Pavilion auction before. If there were no issues, the fifteen bottles of Spirit Yuan Pills should be transmitted from that spot shortly.

"I wonder if your esteemed Pavilion has any Iron Orchid Fruit recently, or other body-refining spiritual herbs?"

As Chu Ning's words fell, Ms. Zhang smiled and said, "It seems Fellow Daoist is quite knowledgeable. We don't have Iron Orchid Fruit in our Pavilion recently, but we do have some other body-refining medicines. Fellow Daoist may take a look. Oh, by the way, it seems there are some Iron Orchid Stem seeds from the sect lately. If Fellow Daoist needs them..."

Chu Ning's heart stirred, but he shook his head for now. "Seeds won't be necessary; I'm not proficient in the Way of Spiritual Plants. Let's just look at your body-refining medicines."

Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Ms. Zhang handed him a jade slip. Chu Ning took it and was immediately surprised. This jade slip actually contained records of seven types of spiritual medicines for body tempering. It listed different prices and corresponding effects.

Chu Ning browsed through it, then focused on two items: Pure Yang Stone Powder and Connecting Meridian Body Tempering Pills. The former was powder ground from Pure Yang Stones, and the latter was a pill specifically refined for body cultivators for tempering. However, neither was for consumption; both were for immersion. According to the jade slip's description, both items were effective for body cultivators equivalent to the Qi Condensation Completion realm.

Chu Ning roughly estimated his current body refining realm. After achieving great success in Un-decaying Bones, he could physically withstand spells from cultivators at Qi Condensation Ninth Layer. Based on this, his current stage in the 'Unbreaking Tendons' cultivation, should be equivalent to the Qi Condensation Completion realm. Thus, these two items were comparatively suitable.

Of these, Pure Yang Stone Powder was 1,000 lower-grade spirit stones per portion, and the dosage could be adjusted as needed. The Connecting Meridian Body Tempering Pill came in bottles of ten pills, at 500 lower-grade spirit stones per bottle.

Seeing the prices of these two items, Chu Ning couldn't help but gasp. Body cultivation items were indeed so expensive. However, considering that these two items were for cultivators at the Qi Condensation Grand Completion realm, the price seemed normal.

Chu Ning thought for a moment and ordered two portions of Pure Yang Stone Powder and six bottles of Connecting Meridian Body Tempering Pills. In a while, his Iron Orchid Fruits would also mature, providing him with body tempering resources. These items were still too expensive; together they would cost 5,000 spirit stones. If he were to use them, it would only last for about three months. It consumed too many spirit stones, so even Chu Ning dared not buy too much.

Spending 8,000 spirit stones in one go, Chu Ning couldn't help but sigh at how quickly spirit stones were spent.

Although Ms. Zhang was slightly surprised that Chu Ning, at Qi Condensation Seventh Layer, would need such high-grade body tempering items, she didn't ask further. Instead, she directly wrote another note and sent it through the circular plate. At the same time, fifteen jade bottles labeled "Spirit Yuan Pills" were transmitted over.

Chu Ning now stated his last request. "I'd like to buy a high-grade magic tool with significant offensive power. What are my options?"

Getting a higher-grade magic tool had been on Chu Ning's mind ever since he killed Liu Laoda and his group. He had previously relied too much on talismans, which was fine under normal circumstances. But Chu Ning also needed to be prepared for extreme situations where talismans might be inconvenient to use. For defense, he already had a mid-grade defensive magic tool, plus his minor success in body refining. And Chu Ning planned to find an opportunity to buy some mid-grade talismans later. So, Chu Ning felt his defensive capabilities were temporarily not an issue.

However, he had always lacked a powerful offensive magic tool, and it had been bothering him. After all, while his Azure Wood Sword Art provided sufficient sustained damage, it lacked explosive power.

Hearing Chu Ning's words, Ms. Zhang said nothing more and directly handed a jade slip to Chu Ning. "These are the high-grade magic tools currently available in our Pavilion. Fellow Daoist, please take a look."

Chu Ning took the jade slip and immediately felt a bit overwhelmed. Unlike the previous list of only seven body tempering items, this jade slip contained nearly a hundred types of magic tools. Chu Ning could only slowly browse and select.

During this process, the Pure Yang Stone Powder and Connecting Meridian Body Tempering Pills were also transmitted over.

"This Flying Wheel seems to have impressive destructive power, but unfortunately, it's a metal-attribute magic tool. If I use it, I might not be able to unleash its full power."

"The Crimson Fire Staff also seems quite good, and there are those Demon Suppressing Shears..."

As Chu Ning scanned, he also roughly memorized the information of various items. When he browsed to the seventy-second item, he finally looked at it closely.

"Divine Wood Longbow, it's actually a wood-attribute offensive magic tool."

After carefully reading the description of the Divine Wood Longbow, Chu Ning immediately decided on this one! This Divine Wood Longbow could actually launch one's own spells as "spell arrows," and it could double the damage of those spells. Paired with his Azure Wood Sword Art, it would not only provide sustained damage but also increase instant damage, which was exactly what he needed.

When Chu Ning's gaze fell on the price, another pang of pain struck him. This offensive magic tool actually cost a staggering 1,200 spirit stones, which was comparable to a defensive magic tool of the same grade.

When Chu Ning raised this question, Ms. Zhang immediately smiled and explained, "Fellow Daoist Li might not know, but this bow was originally a top-tier magic tool. Its spells could be launched as arrows, and their power could be doubled again. However, the arrows were lost for various reasons. After research, our Pavilion discovered its current method of use. But the quality of this bow is absolutely that of a top-tier magic tool, so a higher price is only natural."

Hearing the woman's words, Chu Ning showed a slight look of surprise. He then handed the jade slip back to Ms. Zhang. "Then I'll take this item."

Ms. Zhang took the jade slip and transmitted the request again. Soon, a longbow, entirely green and covered in runes, was delivered. Ms. Zhang handed the longbow, Spirit Yuan Pills, Pure Yang Stone Powder, and Connecting Meridian Body Tempering Pills to Chu Ning.

"That's nine thousand two hundred spirit stones in total. You have one thousand nine hundred sixty-four spirit stones remaining. Would Fellow Daoist like to receive the spirit stones directly, or deposit them into a Spirit Stone Jade Talisman?"

"Spirit Stone Jade Talisman?"

Hearing Ms. Zhang's words, Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. He suddenly recalled the jade talisman he had obtained from Old Man Sun's storage bag. Before coming out today, Chu Ning had intentionally left that talisman in Yanji Market, fearing that it might have some connection with Cloudsea Pavilion that could be detected. Could this be what Ms. Zhang was referring to?

"This Spirit Stone Jade Talisman is a special jade talisman crafted by our Cloudsea Pavilion, primarily used for storing spirit stones. Some customers, due to having a large amount of spirit stones, find it inconvenient to carry them, so they store them with us at Cloudsea Pavilion," Ms. Zhang explained. "We will provide customers with a jade talisman as a token, on which the amount of stored spirit stones will be recorded. With this token, you can withdraw spirit stones at any Cloudsea Pavilion, or directly use it to offset the cost of purchases."

At this point, Ms. Zhang smiled and continued, "This jade talisman is also one of the symbols of our Cloudsea Pavilion's identity. Generally, we only issue them for deposits exceeding five thousand lower-grade spirit stones. With this jade talisman, you will always be attended to by a dedicated specialist when visiting the Pavilion, and you will receive certain discounts on transactions. Fellow Daoist has probably also heard of our Pavilion's auctions; with this jade talisman, you can directly participate regardless of whether you have an introduction from a high-level cultivator."

From Ms. Zhang's words, Chu Ning roughly understood the purpose of the jade talisman. Chu Ning didn't directly respond to her but instead said to Ms. Zhang, "May Fellow Daoist Zhang let Li view a jade talisman? I haven't seen such a thing before."

"Of course!" Ms. Zhang said, taking out a jade talisman and placing it into Chu Ning's hand.

It was indeed this item! Chu Ning held it and recognized at a glance that this jade talisman was identical to the one he had found in Old Man Sun's storage bag. However, he kept his expression calm. He simply held it, looking somewhat curious, and asked Ms. Zhang, "Can others use this jade talisman as well?"

"Yes," Ms. Zhang nodded. "This talisman is un-registered. We recognize the talisman, not the person."

Chu Ning roughly understood the situation, then handed the jade talisman back to Ms. Zhang. "I don't have five thousand spirit stones left in my possession now."

Ms. Zhang, however, did not reach out to take it back. Instead, she smiled and said, "Although Fellow Daoist doesn't have that much spirit stone left now, this time you conducted such a large transaction at our Pavilion, which qualifies you for a jade talisman."

Chu Ning pondered for a moment, then nodded. "That works too. Store one thousand spirit stones into this jade talisman for now. As for the rest, I won't store them for now; I still have other uses for them."

As he spoke, Chu Ning was also thinking that he could, given the opportunity next time, take Old Man Sun's jade talisman to Cloudsea Pavilion and see how many spirit stones were inside. According to Chu Ning's guess, Old Man Sun's jade talisman might have been obtained from auctioning the Seven-Star Spirit Fruits at Cloudsea Pavilion. However, Old Man Sun seemed to have used quite a few things during their previous intense battle, so it was uncertain how many spirit stones were still in that jade talisman.

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, Ms. Zhang placed the jade talisman and the spirit stones in front of Chu Ning. "Fellow Daoist Li, it's done. However, Fellow Daoist must remember to keep this jade talisman safe. If it is lost, our Cloudsea Pavilion will only recognize the talisman itself."

Chu Ning nodded, indicating he understood, and said nothing further, standing up to prepare to leave.

"Fellow Daoist, please wait!" Ms. Zhang also stood up at this moment. She then looked at Chu Ning with a smile and asked, "I wonder if Fellow Daoist is interested in becoming an honored guest talisman master for our Cloudsea Pavilion? There's no other meaning; it's simply for you to regularly sell the talismans you draw to us. Regardless of the quantity, we can follow today's prices. And if Fellow Daoist purchases anything from our Pavilion, there will also be certain spirit stone discounts."

The moment her words fell, Chu Ning directly shook his head. "No interest. I'm used to being unrestrained." He naturally had no interest in directly associating himself with Cloudsea Pavilion under the title of an honored guest.

Ms. Zhang's expression did not change much upon hearing this; she continued to smile and said, "That is truly a pity. However, if Fellow Daoist has talismans of similar quality in the future, we hope you will still come to our Cloudsea Pavilion."

Chu Ning noncommittally nodded, his mind already set on not returning to Cloudsea Pavilion to sell talismans again anytime soon, as it drew too much attention.

Subsequently, Chu Ning left the room amidst Ms. Zhang's polite words. Ms. Zhang did not leave the room, instead, an attendant from outside escorted Chu Ning out of Cloudsea Pavilion.

After leaving Cloudsea Pavilion, Chu Ning found a secluded spot and dispelled his Illusionary Transformation spell, returning to his original appearance. At the same time, he used his Yin Wood Spirit Body to conceal his aura, making himself appear to be at the fifth layer of Qi Condensation. After walking around for a bit, he re-entered Cloudsea Pavilion.
