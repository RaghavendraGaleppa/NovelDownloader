# Chapter 48: The Great Ape  

Fang Yi and the members of the Ninth Courtyard stood guard in the Xuan District, surrounding and hunting down a first-tier Azure Wolf. For them, a first-tier demon beast posed little threat.  

Above them, Han Yue soared through the air on his escape light, the [Gengjin Blade Embryo] in hand. The power of [Mindless Slash] was condensed within the blade, showing no outward leakage. With the battlefield still teeming with demon beasts, this promised to be a prolonged battle, and Han Yue was careful to conserve his energy.  

His escape light flickered as he monitored the battlefield, darting from one spot to another. He struck at weak points—eyes, the back of the neck, the hindquarters, or the perineum—delivering precise, lethal blows. Over the years, Han Yue had lost count of how many demon beasts he had slain, making him the most experienced hunter in the entire Butcher's Market.  

To outsiders, his blade work was ruthless, his escape light precise, and his slaughter of demon beasts as effortless as cutting melons and vegetables.  

Yet, despite Han Yue and the other cultivators' efforts, their impact was limited. The true killing machines were the large-scale war artifacts deployed by the various courtyards. These artifacts, powered and operated by twenty to thirty Body Realm cultivators, unleashed attacks rivaling the strength of second-tier Divine Ability Realm techniques. Though their firing rate couldn't match that of individual cultivators, they still unleashed devastating strikes at regular intervals.  

Against first-tier demon beasts, these war artifacts were a one-shot kill. Even second-tier beasts could only endure a few hits before succumbing, especially when restrained by second-tier cultivators. In the short time since the battle began, the war artifacts had already claimed over a thousand demon beasts.  

Thanks to Han Yue's relentless strikes, the pressure on the Ninth Courtyard's position had significantly lessened. He now shifted his focus toward the Huang District.  

As the battle raged on, the corpses of demon beasts piled into mountains. The cultivators' stamina and energy waned, and casualties mounted. Han Yue found himself striking more frequently.  

Just as he spotted another second-tier demon beast and prepared to engage, a flash of sword light cleaved the beast's head in two. It was Yang Fan, the master of the Sword Courtyard.  

A sword cultivator from a major sect, Yang Fan's combat prowess was unmatched. At the peak of the second-tier Divine Ability Realm, his killing efficiency far surpassed Han Yue's restrained efforts. He acknowledged Han Yue with a nod before vanishing into another part of the battlefield.  

Though the battle was intense, the Butcher's Market held the advantage of terrain, keeping the situation under control.  

But just as everyone was fully immersed in the fight—  

---  

A surge of energy erupted from beneath the ground, emerging at the central plaza of the Butcher's Market. The energy took form—a towering, five-meter-tall golden ape.  

The ape's bloodline energy and power overflowed uncontrollably, radiating an overwhelming aura. Unfortunately, the central plaza was deserted due to the ongoing battle, so no one witnessed the sudden appearance of this third-tier demon beast.  

This was none other than the giant Hu Le'er had referred to as "Da Yuan." After secluded cultivation deep underground, Da Yuan had successfully broken through to the third-tier with the aid of [Emperor's Nectar].  

Earlier, he had received Hu Le'er's distress signal, informing him that she had been framed, hunted, and forced into a desperate situation, planning to escape using the [Peach God Branch]. He remained unaware of the subsequent fourth-tier battle.  

Enraged by Hu Le'er's suffering, Da Yuan was determined to exact vengeance. Had his breakthrough failed, he would have been powerless. But now, as a third-tier demon beast with a newly acquired formidable innate ability, he was ready to unleash his fury on behalf of his beloved elder sister.  

Using his third-tier aura, Da Yuan had spent five days driving countless demon beasts from a radius of ten thousand li, inciting the war that now engulfed the Butcher's Market.  

But Da Yuan had already chosen his target.  

He channeled his energy and unleashed his most powerful innate ability—[Heaven and Earth Manifestation]!  

In an instant, his body expanded rapidly, soaring into the sky. His colossal form stretched out, demolishing several nearby courtyards with a single motion. The sudden appearance of this behemoth stirred violent winds, sending debris flying and plunging the area into chaos.  

Han Yue, who had been darting across the battlefield, suddenly found himself shrouded in darkness. He turned and saw a ten-thousand-meter-tall giant ape standing at the center of the Butcher's Market.  

The ape's massive frame blotted out the sun, casting a shadow over half the battlefield, as if night had fallen. Even from a distance, Han Yue could feel the overwhelming energy radiating from the beast.  

This was a third-tier demon beast!  

The moment the giant ape appeared, over three hundred war artifacts swiveled toward it and unleashed a barrage of attacks. Yet, when the deadly strikes landed, they dissipated into wisps of smoke, leaving not a single mark.  

The third-tier demon beast bent its knees and leaped into the air. The sheer force of its movement generated immense kinetic energy, obliterating the central part of the Butcher's Market upon landing.  

With a few simple movements, the ape had already destroyed a fifth of the settlement.  

It then turned toward the Tian District, taking just two steps—crushing several courtyards along the way—before arriving before the Merchant House.  

The giant ape bent down and roared at the building, which now seemed no larger than a small box:  

"Xu Yuan! Come out and face your death!"  

With that, the ape swung a devastating punch toward the Merchant House.  

At the critical moment, the building emitted a green glow, forming a protective barrier. The ape's fist collided with the barrier, producing a deafening metallic clang that shook the earth.  

The entire Merchant House was driven into the ground, leaving only its top few floors exposed.  

Undeterred, the ape dug its hands into the earth, pried the building free, and lifted it overhead before hurling it diagonally into the ground.  

The Merchant House tumbled like a rolling boulder, carving a deep trench through the Butcher's Market and reducing countless courtyards to rubble.  

The destruction and casualties sent the cultivators into a frenzy.  

Many second-tier cultivators abandoned the front lines to return and unleash their divine abilities and spells upon the ape. Though over a third of the war artifacts had been destroyed, the remaining ones continued to bombard the beast.  

No one fled.  

Even those whose homes had been destroyed grabbed whatever weapons they could find and charged at the enemy.  

But to the giant ape, none of this posed any threat. The ants at its feet were crushed with the slightest movement, leaving countless dead and wounded in its wake.  

The Butcher's Market had reached a critical juncture of life and death.  

If this great ape was not subdued, the thousand-year-old stronghold would be utterly annihilated!
