# Chapter 75: Selling Purified Demon Cores

The night deepened unnoticed.

Inside the cultivation chamber, the soothing incense released a faint, tranquil fragrance.

Zhang Jing, seated cross-legged on a meditation cushion, slowly opened his eyes, a smile unconsciously forming at their corners. His cultivation had made another noticeable advancement.

When he left Luodu Tower during the day, Zhang Jing had taken with him the three bottles of Water Essence Pills promised by Senior Brother Li. He had just been cultivating using these pills.

As he had experienced before, high-grade spirit pills truly lived up to their reputation—their effects far surpassed those of Purple Spirit Pills. Combined with the water-attribute spirit herbs in his possession, Zhang Jing estimated that if he continued cultivating steadily like this, the probability of reaching the tenth level of Qi Refinement before the opening of the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven was already eighty to ninety percent.

However—that was only a high probability, not a certainty.

His gaze suddenly sharpened as a thought occurred to him.

Both might be at the tenth level of Qi Refinement, but Zhang Jing didn't believe that entering the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven with a newly advanced tenth-level cultivation would be the same as entering with the terrifying strength of Senior Brother Li. Therefore, although Senior Brother Li's requirement was merely to reach the tenth level, Zhang Jing's goal was far more ambitious.

He wanted much more.

"It seems obtaining a top-grade cultivation method is urgent," Zhang Jing thought to himself.

From observing Chen Xiandao and Shen Qingqing, it was clear that the cultivation speed of top-grade methods was incomparable to his current Five Organs Water Essence Guidance Scripture. The gap between them might even be tenfold. Otherwise, how could top-tier geniuses typically break through to the tenth level of Qi Refinement in just three to five years under normal circumstances?

While innate talent certainly played a role, Zhang Jing believed the top-grade cultivation method was likely the key factor. After all, during the assessment, he had already witnessed the all-encompassing enhancement provided by Dao Rhyme, let alone complete Dao Rhyme!

Additionally, there were the demon cores.

During his cultivation earlier, he had made a simple comparison. With the Five Treasures Spirit River's ability to "digest demon cores" for cultivation, roughly three Water Essence Pills were equivalent to a single water-attribute demon core from a first-level Qi Refinement demon.

At this realization, even Zhang Jing, who possessed the Source Talisman, couldn't help but feel astonished. Although he didn't know exactly how much profit alchemists made from refining spirit pills, judging from his comparison, even accounting for failed attempts and material costs, the profit margin must be several times or even dozens of times higher.

After all, the price of a single Water Essence Pill was enough to buy two purified first-level Qi Refinement demon cores.

Returning to the present, Zhang Jing's gaze gradually grew resolute as a plan took shape in his mind.

Tomorrow, he would first go to the resource repository to sell all the unnecessary spirit herbs and purified demon cores in his possession, accumulating enough Dao merits to exchange for a top-grade inheritance.

Next, he would apply for an overseer position as soon as possible. Becoming an overseer would allow him to purchase water-attribute treasures from the squad's resource repository at lower prices. More importantly—and this was what Zhang Jing valued most—he could issue personal missions to gather large quantities of water-attribute demon cores and various water-attribute treasures.

As long as the price was high enough, Zhang Jing believed he could fully mobilize the formidable resources of the top ten squads in the outer court. As for what repercussions this might have or whom it might offend, he wasn't overly concerned.

Zhang Jing saw things clearly: as long as his cultivation progress met expectations, Senior Brother Li and the Luodu Squad would naturally shield him from any backlash. Until he reached the tenth level of Qi Refinement, Zhang Jing wouldn't leave the Dao Academy's grounds. As long as he remained alive, the more prodigious his performance, the less anyone would dare to act against him!

When it came to matters of benefit, Zhang Jing had to consider every angle.

At most, it would take a year and a half. Combined with the Water Essence Pills provided by Senior Brother Li and multiple approaches working in tandem, Zhang Jing felt his cultivation speed might exceed everyone's expectations—including his own.

As for the Dao merits needed to gather demon cores and treasures, that wasn't a significant problem for him now. After all, he had the Talisman Copying Machine.

The next day, Zhang Jing ended his cultivation early and headed out of his cave abode. As he passed the spirit plant chamber, Lu Thirty-Eight suddenly poked out his head and cautiously reminded him, "Master, don't forget my life-saving ring."

"I know."

But as soon as he spoke, Zhang Jing's footsteps halted. He looked at Lu Thirty-Eight in surprise, "Thirty-Eight, what are you doing here?"

"Master, didn't you say this was the spirit plant chamber? The spiritual energy here is so rich—it's a shame to leave it empty without planting any spirit herbs," Lu Thirty-Eight replied with a simple smile before returning to his diligent digging.

Standing there, Zhang Jing considered telling him that they might not be staying in this cave abode for long, so there was no need to plant spirit herbs. But he couldn't bring himself to dampen the deer spirit's enthusiasm. Deciding not to say anything more, he simply turned and left.

They were just some spirit herbs—if necessary, they could always be transplanted later. Lu Thirty-Eight should be quite skilled at that.

At the southwestern corner of Luodu Island, Zhang Jing stood before an ancient-looking building cast into the mountainside. "This should be the place," he murmured.

Back when he was still in Langya County City, he had inquired with Senior Brother Yan and learned that the resource repository served as the Luodu Squad's storage and distribution center. High-ranking squad members and overseers could not only exchange for cultivation resources at lower prices here but also sell various materials. It was essentially a simplified version of the Thousand Methods Pavilion.

Currently, the entrance to the resource repository was bustling with figures in green robes coming and going.

"Most of these people have probably just returned from Langya County to sell their materials," Zhang Jing guessed privately, sensing faint traces of killing intent on many of them.

Merging into the crowd, Zhang Jing stepped inside.

As soon as he entered, a petite woman approached him eagerly, "Senior Brother, are you here to sell or exchange resources?"

Zhang Jing smiled at her, "I'd like to sell some items."

"Please come this way, Senior Brother," the woman said gracefully, leading him to a bronze door nearby.

The door slowly opened, revealing a secret chamber. Inside, at a square table in the center, a white-haired old man seemed to have been waiting for some time.

"Please have a seat, Junior Brother," the old man said with a kind smile.

"Senior Brother, are you also a member of our Luodu Squad?" Zhang Jing asked curiously.

"Junior Brother, no—this old man belongs to the Thousand Methods Pavilion," the old man replied straightforwardly.

Hearing this, a flicker of surprise passed through Zhang Jing's eyes. If the old man was from the Thousand Methods Pavilion, then the Luodu Squad's resource repository might essentially be... which meant the other top ten squads were likely similar.

In that moment, Zhang Jing suddenly understood why Senior Brother Li had seemed strangely constrained when deciding on his cultivation resources earlier.

Composing himself, Zhang Jing looked directly at the old man and asked, "Senior Brother, do you purchase demon cores with the demonic remnants purified? And at what price?"

The old man's eyes lit up, "Junior Brother, you have purified demon cores?"

Zhang Jing nodded.

"Such demon cores are extremely rare. Our purchase price is double that of ordinary demon cores of the same level," the old man said with a beaming smile.
