## Chapter 6: The Mysterious Canyon

After leaving the Flying Cloud Hall, Lin Xuan found a secluded spot where he let his smile fade, revealing a somber expression and a flash of killing intent in his eyes. He stood there for a moment, lost in thought, his mind still reeling from his encounter with Elder Ma. Though he had made a deep impression on Lin Xuan, he wouldn't act impulsively now. However, once he gained sufficient strength...

The sound of footsteps interrupted his thoughts, and Lin Xuan quickly erased the dark emotions from his face, replacing them with a neutral expression as he turned to face the approaching individuals.

"Ha! You know, that waste, Lin Xuan, got two bottles of useless pills," one of them said, their voices carrying clearly to Lin Xuan's ears.

"What's so strange about that? A commoner without any spiritual roots doesn't deserve to consume pills refined from heavenly materials. It's fitting that he's got useless pills," another person sneered, showing no regard for the fact that Lin Xuan was standing right beside them, listening to their conversation.

Lin Xuan didn't react, maintaining his calm demeanor as he walked past them. A true achiever couldn't be swayed by momentary impulses or emotions. He made a mental note of these individuals, deciding to bide his time until he was strong enough to deal with them.

Lin Xuan's priority now was to focus on his cultivation. Initially, he had planned to use the Xi Sui Dan to break through to the second layer of his technique, but upon examining the useless pills in his possession, he changed his mind. He decided to take a risk and see if he could find any valuable herbs.

Not far from the sect was a secluded canyon with a hidden entrance, rarely visited by others. Lin Xuan had stumbled upon it by chance and had occasionally found precious herbs there. Although the chances were slim, it was worth a try, especially since some ancient, spiritual grasses could significantly enhance one's cultivation.

After weighing his options, Lin Xuan left the Floating Cloud Valley, ensuring he wasn't followed by taking a circuitous route. Only when he was certain he was alone did he divert from the main path and make his way to the hidden canyon.

Upon entering the canyon, Lin Xuan was greeted by a vibrant landscape filled with wildflowers and a sweet fragrance. However, his purpose wasn't to enjoy the scenery but to search for herbs that could aid his cultivation. As he searched, time passed, but Lin Xuan remained undeterred, knowing he had only covered a small area.

Just as he was continuing his search, he heard voices approaching. Without hesitation, Lin Xuan hid in the nearby grass. Two individuals, clad in the attire of the Floating Cloud Valley, descended into the canyon, landing not far from Lin Xuan's hiding spot.

"Master, is your injury serious?" a young woman asked, her voice filled with concern.

Lin Xuan peeked through the grass and saw that the pair wore the sect's uniform. The man, who appeared to be in his forties with a weak complexion and bloodstains on his chest, was none other than Zhang Yu, the elder who had taught them the Spiritual Shield technique. Zhang Yu was said to be at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment realm, a protector of their sect.

The woman, Zhou Yan, was a senior disciple, known for her impressive cultivation at the peak of the Ling Dong realm. Lin Xuan recognized her as one of the top younger cultivators in the sect, with a promising future ahead.

Lin Xuan observed that both Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan seemed to be in a state of panic, as if they were being pursued. Their behavior was unusual, given that they were already within the sect's territory.

As Lin Xuan watched, Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan rested by a tree. Lin Xuan continued to observe, intrigued by their presence and the secrecy surrounding their actions.

Lin Xuan realized that if they had a significant secret and he had stumbled upon it, they would likely silence him to prevent exposure. The world of cultivation was brutal, governed by the law of the jungle. Lin Xuan didn't want to become an unintended victim.

Zhang Yu, being at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, and Zhou Yan, at the peak of Ling Dong, were far more powerful than Lin Xuan. Even injured, they could easily eliminate him.

Lin Xuan held his breath, remaining as still as possible, hoping they would rest for a while and then leave.

"Ah, there's someone!" Zhou Yan exclaimed, her voice causing Lin Xuan's heart to skip a beat.

Before Lin Xuan could react, a cry of pain followed.

"You...you've betrayed me?" Zhang Yu's voice was laced with shock, anger, and a hint of disbelief. "Why?"

"Hmph, Master, you shouldn't waste your energy. The Golden Rope is still in my possession, a gift from you. You know its power. With your current condition, you can barely muster two-tenths of your usual strength. You won't be able to break free."
