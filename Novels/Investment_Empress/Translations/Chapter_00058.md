Chapter 58: Breaking Through to Seventeen Meridians, the Muralong Family's Gratitude

In the Murong mansion, there was a quiet room that was typically used by successive generations of Murong family leaders for cultivation. Murong Xiao had obtained permission to enter this quiet room.

"Grandfather, why did you call me here?" he asked as soon as he entered.

Murong Hai, his grandfather, was sitting on a prayer mat with a wooden box beside him. "I'm here to check on your progress. Now that you've joined the Qingyuan Sect, I want to see if you've slacked off."

Murong Xiao replied, "Don't worry, Grandfather. I've been remembering your words."

Murong Hai asked, "How many meridians have you opened in the Blood Qi realm?"

Murong Xiao answered honestly, "Seven meridians. I'm just a step away from opening the eighth."

Murong Hai nodded in approval. "Not bad. You're much stronger than I was back then. But let's see how you fare in a fight."

Murong Hai stood up, and his aura suppressed to the seventh meridian of the Blood Qi realm. "Come, let's spar."

The quiet room was filled with the sound of fists and feet colliding, as well as the hum of energy.

After a stick of incense had burned, Murong Xiao collapsed to the ground, drenched in sweat. "Stop, Grandfather. You're too strong."

Murong Hai looked at his grandson with satisfaction. "You're already much stronger than the average person at the Blood Qi realm. If you can break through to the eighth meridian and master the Golden Bell Shield to a moderate level, ordinary people at the Blood Qi realm won't be able to break through your defenses."

Murong Xiao smiled, feeling proud. "Am I really that strong?"

Murong Hai said, "You're definitely among the top five in the Nine Peaks Martial Meet."

Murong Xiao shook his head. "I'm not sure, Grandfather. There are many talented people in my generation."

Murong Hai chuckled. "You're just being too modest. You may not be the strongest, but you're definitely among the top."

He handed Murong Xiao a box containing two blue pills. "These are two four-纹 Broken Meridian Pills. They should help you break through to the next meridian."

Murong Xiao's eyes widened. "Grandfather, won't the other family members have any objections?"

Murong Hai snorted. "You're my Murong family's genius, the future pillar of our family. Why should I waste money on others?"

Murong Xiao took the pills and swallowed one. Soon, he felt a cracking sound in his body, and his meridian opened.

Murong Hai beamed with pride. "Not bad. You're indeed my Murong family's prodigy."

Murong Xiao put the remaining pill back in the box. "Grandfather, I want to give this pill to Li Mo. He gave me some medicine before."

Murong Hai's expression turned complicated. "What kind of medicine?"

Murong Xiao replied, "A bottle of six-纹 Clear Heart Pills."

Murong Hai's face twitched. He rummaged through a small room in the quiet chamber and returned with a box. "Let's go see Li Mo. I've picked out a few treasures for him."

As they walked to Li Mo's courtyard, Murong Hai's expression remained complicated. He had intended to give Li Mo a gift, but it turned out that Li Mo had already given Murong Xiao a valuable gift.

When they arrived at Li Mo's courtyard, they found that it was filled with animals, and the peach blossoms had new buds despite the passing of spring. Murong Hai's expression turned stunned.

Suddenly, a loud roar echoed from the room, followed by a strong aura fluctuation. Murong Hai's eyes widened. "Li Mo is breaking through?"

Murong Xiao nodded. "Yes, Li Mo is like this sometimes."

Another loud roar echoed from the room, and the sound of something breaking followed. Murong Hai's face turned pale. "He's breaking through to... seventeen meridians?"

Murong Xiao shrugged. "Li Mo is just very talented, Grandfather."

Li Mo emerged from the room, apologizing for breaking the bathtub. Murong Hai was still in shock, his mind reeling with the implications of Li Mo's breakthrough.

As they stood there, Murong Hai finally understood why Murong Xiao felt that he wasn't the most talented person. Being around Li Mo made it difficult to have confidence.
