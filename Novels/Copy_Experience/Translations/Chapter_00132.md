Chapter 131: A Sinister Hidden Hand

After Lu Xu's figure disappeared, another figure emerged from the room. This person looked significantly younger than Wei Mingyang, a middle-aged man with a striking appearance. Upon closer inspection, one would find his features quite similar to Wei Mingyang's.

If Lu Xu's Eight-Armed Fiend had been present, it would have recognized this man as the Wei family Foundation Establishment cultivator who had first appeared when Lu Xu single-handedly breached the Thousand Absolutes Sect's medicinal garden's restriction that day. He had been intercepted by the Eight-Armed Fiend at that time.
