# Chapter 10: Sunrise, Sunset

The sun rose, and the sun set.

Day after day, a line stretching for miles would rise with the morning sun to begin its journey, and camp under the evening glow as dusk fell.

Armed cavalry in black military uniforms, tall warriors holding halberds, beautiful maidservants riding camels, ornate four-horse carriages, and simple coffins...

This peculiar procession appeared daily on the Longshang plains, adding a splash of vibrant color to the monotonous natural scenery.

"Miss, have some honey water. You've been traveling for half the day," Qingmei said, handing over a silver cup gilded with gold.

Taking the opportunity to pass the cup, Qingmei scrutinized Suo Chanzhi closely.

Qingmei was secretly amazed. The Miss had become increasingly beautiful these past few days, her face glowing with vitality.

Her skin, originally fair and delicate, now seemed so tender it might break at the slightest touch. It was as if a jade-like luster flowed constantly beneath her surface, a beauty beyond compare.

Had the Miss secretly used some new rouge or powder?

But Qingmei was the one who bought all the Miss's cosmetics. It seemed... no brand of powder could produce such an effect.

Suo Chanzhi took the silver cup, her lips lightly brushing the rim as she took a small sip.

The honey water was perfectly balanced, not cloyingly sweet.

"How much... *cough*... how much longer until we reach Tianshui?" Suo Chanzhi asked softly. Her originally clear voice was now inexplicably a bit hoarse.

However, that hoarseness wasn't unpleasant; on the contrary, it carried a unique allure that made one's heart itch with a酥麻 (numbing) sensation.

This piece of "kneaded and rested" dough seemed to have gradually adapted to Yang Can's grinding, becoming resilient and soft, turning bitterness into sweetness.

Of course, she would never admit this.

Qingmei replied, "This servant has already inquired. At our current pace, we will cross the mountain ahead by tomorrow morning. Once we are over that mountain, we will enter the territory of Tianshui."

Suo Chanzhi let out a soft "mm" and turned her gaze back out the window.

Distant mountains were as dark as ink, wild grass grew thickly nearby, and a few wild rabbits, startled by the procession, darted quickly into the depths of the undergrowth.

Suo Chanzhi's eyes quickly located Yang Can. Watching that elegant figure riding and controlling his horse, her teeth involuntarily began to itch again.

That bastard. His methods for tormenting people were becoming more and more varied.

Why did he know so much?

The thought that she might not be the first "dough" Yang Can had kneaded made Suo Chanzhi feel deeply uncomfortable.

The mountain marking the border of Tianshui was just ahead. According to Nurse Tu's plan, Yang Can's usefulness was about to end.

He wouldn't be able to cross that mountain. Tonight would likely be his last night.

Suo Chanzhi secretly decided that when they camped for the night, she would go speak with Nurse Tu.

Why did this Yang Can have to die?

She wasn't舍不得 (unwilling to part with him). She simply felt that Yang Can was a retainer to the eldest son of the Yu family's main branch and held a significant position within the family.

Therefore, keeping him alive could clearly serve a greater purpose.

***

Inside the carriage, Nurse Tu sat with her eyes slightly closed, seemingly resting.

Beside the carriage, a Suo family warrior controlled the horse's speed and reported in a low voice to the person inside:

"Nurse Tu, at our current pace, we will cross the mountain ahead tomorrow and enter the Yu family's territory."

"Mm. Has the Yu family sent anyone to receive the coffin?"

"The Young Master Yu's death was sudden. Even if the Yu family sent someone, they wouldn't have had time to notify us in advance. This subordinate has no way to scout their movements."

"Never mind..."

Nurse Tu waved her hand and slowly opened her eyes.

According to her estimate of the journey, even if the Yu family sent someone immediately upon receiving the news, they would likely only arrive after the procession entered Yu territory.

So... even in the best-case scenario, the two parties wouldn't meet until tomorrow.

In that case, that小子 (brat) Yang Can could die tonight.

Not just Yang Can; she would have to find an opportunity to get rid of that little maid Qingmei as well.

That way, the only people who knew this secret would be Suo Chanzhi and this old woman.

Thinking of this得意 (satisfying) point, Nurse Tu couldn't help but smile slightly.

When she sent someone to report the death to the Suo family in Jincheng, she hadn't yet thought of such a brilliant plan.

By the time she devised this method, Leopard Head had already strengthened his guard, making it difficult for her to send someone out without raising suspicion.

However, she didn't want to send anyone even if she could, because she suddenly felt it would be better for this secret to be known only by her.

A secret known only to her would be a "rare commodity," allowing her to seize the greatest benefit.

To this end, she had even told Suo Chanzhi of this plan, to prevent her from letting it slip to her family later.

However, her true motive could not be revealed. The reason Nurse Tu gave Suo Chanzhi was:

"After all, this concerns your reputation and is of great importance. It is better not to let too many people know."

***

Nurse Tu, having made her decision, instructed the knight outside the carriage window in a low voice: "After we camp tonight, have one of our men find an excuse to start a fight with the Yu family people. Make the disturbance big!"

The knight on horseback nodded, and with a light pull on the reins, trotted forward.

Nurse Tu did not expect that the people from the Yu family would arrive earlier than she had anticipated.

According to the pace of the people she had sent, the Yu family shouldn't have arrived so quickly.

She did not know that Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan, having received Yang Can's guidance, had secretly sent someone to take a shortcut to Phoenix Mountain ahead of time.

Thus, the people sent by the Yu family arrived that very evening.

At dusk, as they were setting up camp at the foot of the mountain, a group of over forty riders suddenly galloped out from the valley.

The horses were all tall, sturdy, first-class steeds from the Northwest. The riders were mostly young men in their twenties with agile and strong physiques.

They wore sturdy sky-blue cotton riding clothes of the same color, with six-inch-wide leather belts around their waists.

Their belts were插 (inserted) with daggers, and their victory hooks held long sabers. Each carried a longbow over his shoulder and a quiver at his waist, making them fully armed.

The leader appeared to be around forty years old. He wore an indigo-blue brocade riding suit, carried a long sword without a tassel at his waist, and had a gray-blue cape fluttering in the wind.

This man had a square face and a wide mouth, thick eyebrows, and dark mustache. His expression was cold, and his gaze carried an imposing aura that commanded respect without anger.

"Steward Yi."

The Yu family guards, who had already prepared for a fight, immediately put away their weapons and cupped their fists in salute upon recognizing the man.

"Steward Yi!"

Yang Can shouted loudly and vaulted from his horse in one fluid motion.

He ran forward a few steps to dissipate the momentum, then cried out in grief, "Steward Yi, the Young Master... was unfortunately killed by horse bandits!"

Nurse Tu glanced casually at Yang Can, not too tense.

Yang Can was Yu Chengye's retainer. It was only natural for him to be grief-stricken upon seeing someone from the Yu family.

During the journey, Yang Can had always been very obedient in front of her, and these displays had successfully麻痹 (numbed) Nurse Tu.

Steward Yi ignored Yang Can and rode straight past him.

This Steward Yi was a major external steward of the Yu family in Tianshui, named Yi She, ranked third among the family's external stewards.

Yi She immediately spotted the simple coffin. He quickly dismounted and walked over with swift strides.

As he drew closer, his pace slowed, and his expression grew increasingly grave.

The death of the eldest son of the main branch meant the Yu family was likely to be thrown into turmoil. This put great pressure on him.

Nurse Tu slowly stepped down from her carriage. The knight beside her moved closer and whispered, "Nurse Tu, the Yu family is here. Should we cancel tonight's action?"

Nurse Tu said coolly, "What does it matter that the Yu family has come? Young Master Yu died at the hands of horse bandits; that cannot be blamed on us. What does it matter if we kill one insignificant retainer now?"

After speaking, Nurse Tu ignored the knight and walked toward Yi She.

At this moment, Yang Can had already hurriedly caught up to Yi She and shouted, "Steward Yi, the Young Master's death is highly suspicious!"

Hearing this, Yi She spun around sharply, his piercing gaze sweeping toward Yang Can.

Nurse Tu, who was about to approach, felt her heart tighten, and her old eyes also fixed intently on Yang Can.

Inside the four-horse carriage, Suo Chanzhi's heart tightened upon hearing Yang Can's shout.

At that moment, only one thought remained in her mind: *If Yang Can reveals the truth, what will become of me, a woman whose reputation will be ruined?*

A huge wave of紧张 (nervousness) made her delicate body tremble uncontrollably.

Yi She stared intently at Yang Can and said in a deep voice, "Mr. Yang, you say the Young Master's death is highly suspicious. What do you mean by that?"

Yang Can completely ignored Nurse Tu's threatening gaze and said to Yi She, "Steward Yi, during our entire journey, the Young Master's close protection was entirely handled by the Suo family. Yet, when the horse bandits attacked, they should have been after wealth, but they ignored the large amounts of goods and charged straight for the center of the camp to assassinate the Young Master. All of this is too illogical. It shows that the Suo family must have a problem."

Leopard Head, witnessing this scene, couldn't help but widen his eyes in astonishment.

*Damn! Is Master Yang this brave?*

Yes, I did say that the Yu and Suo families are like cats and mice living together, each wary of the other, but such matters cannot be laid out on the table.

Even though I've already fought with the Suo family people, that was just a conflict between subordinates, leaving some room for maneuver.

To say the Suo family are suspects in the Young Master's murder is like climbing onto the table and slapping the face of the Suo family head.

Cheng Dakuan felt he had guessed Yang Can's intention. Mr. Yang was taking an unorthodox path, hoping to gain the favor of the Yu family head by adopting an attitude of opposition, even hostility, toward the Suo family.

But... the family head is currently relying on the Suo family's strength. Wouldn't this backfire?

Nurse Tu, upon hearing this, secretly breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed this brat Yang Can didn't dare to mention that he had already touched the Young Mistress of the Yu family.

It seemed this brat wasn't stupid and had guessed that this old woman would silence him, so he was desperately trying to link Yu Chengye's death to the Suo family, claiming they were major suspects.

He wanted to use this trick to make me wary of him, didn't he?

If he were to suddenly die after accusing my Suo family of being major suspects in Yu Chengye's murder, then my family would naturally become suspect.

However, do you think that by saying this, this old woman will spare your life to avoid suspicion?

Haha, don't be so naive!
