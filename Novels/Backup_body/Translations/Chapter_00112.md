# Chapter 112: Hundred-Zhang Golden Body, Five Blades Behead  

In an instant, twenty-five golden dragons coiled around the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk.  

Li Zhengjing charged in, wielding the Five Thunder Mountain-Splitting Blade, unleashing thunderbolts in a frenzied barrage!  

His left arm raised the Divine Fire of Separation, flames and sword intent erupting together!  
At the same moment, his surrounding mana condensed into small dragons outside his body, each opening their mouths to spit out the Great Void Myriad Transformation Sword Qi, all shooting toward the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk within the encirclement!  

"..."  

Meanwhile, the Young Sect Master of Kunlun slashed his sword again and again, cleaving one hill after another.  

The giant yellow dog was suppressed by his sword light, unable to fight back. But this dog was, after all, a demon immortal who had inherited the legacy of the Martial Combat God King from ancient times. Having cultivated for many years, its cultivation surpassed the Young Sect Master’s. Though suppressed, its ability to preserve its life was formidable.  

Even with the direct lineage inheritance of the Kunlun Sect Leader, the Young Sect Master found it difficult to kill the dog in a short time.  

Yet the dragon roars and Li Zhengjing’s loud shouts from behind instantly darkened the Young Sect Master’s mood.  

He glanced over and saw the twenty-five golden dragons. The only thought that flashed through his mind was: *This kid has no sense of rules at all!*  

They had agreed to rely on their own abilities, but Li Zhengjing had pulled out such a massive Dragon Pillar of the Hall and unleashed twenty-five golden dragons!  

"I wanted to test your skills, not your treasures!" the Young Sect Master couldn’t help but shout angrily.  

"Did we agree not to use treasures?" Li Zhengjing looked genuinely puzzled. "Then what about that Sect Leader-grade sword in your hand?"  

"..." The Young Sect Master stared at the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber in Li Zhengjing’s hand, momentarily at a loss for words.  

"Honor your bet!"  

Li Zhengjing said, "Even if you’ve erased the Great Void Myriad Transformation Sword Qi, you can’t erase the credibility of the esteemed Young Sect Master, right?"  

The Young Sect Master’s expression twisted with complicated emotions before he finally vented his fury on the Fifth Helmsman of the Salvation Golden Ship—the demon immortal before him.  

"Young Sect Master of Kunlun, this king has been waiting for you all for a long time. Did you think I’d fall so easily when I intended to wipe you all out in one go?"  

The yellow dog howled at the sky. In the next instant, even more dazzling Buddhist light erupted from within the twenty-five golden dragons!  

The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s golden body was battered, but under the Buddhist light, it instantly regenerated. His golden body expanded with the wind, growing to a towering height of a hundred zhang!  

"Ghost Valley Divine Official, watch carefully!"  

The yellow dog declared proudly, "This is the new First Helmsman chosen by the Salvation Heavenly Venerable! You betrayed us time and again, and now your skills are far inferior to what they once were. From now on, he will take your place—see his power for yourself!"  

The Young Sect Master’s gaze sharpened, his expression grave.  

Li Zhengjing took a step back, gripping the Dragon Pillar of the Hall, golden dragons coiling around him.  

Ghost Valley Divine Official, watching from the periphery, showed a strange expression and muttered, "A perfected golden body, comparable to the upper realm of human immortals. But this guy has actually gathered a massive amount of faith and wish power?"  

Yuan Zhengfeng said quietly, "The Buddhist sect spreads its teachings widely in the mortal world, gathering faith and wish power—similar to the false gods. In the past, I was only at the True Qi realm, and after barely reaching the human immortal stage, I took my own life. So I never understood—though the Heavenly Domain Divine Stone can gather faith and wish power, how do Buddhist practitioners, being flesh and blood, utilize it? It seems today we’ll find out."  

The Buddhist light shone, visible to all!  

This mountain was home to a man-eating tiger, and the Living Buddha had subdued it, spreading his fame far and wide.  

Recently, villagers from all directions had come to worship, and almost all had their wishes granted. They even received prayer beads to protect their homes and lives.  

Ordinary folk naturally had no idea of this "Living Buddha’s" true methods, nor did they know the hidden dangers within the so-called prayer beads!  

Villagers who came to pray here had all been infected with evil energy. Though it invigorated them in the short term, alleviating illnesses and seemingly improving their health, it was actually draining their life force.  

After some time, once their life force was exhausted, their illnesses would worsen, and the evil energy would further corrode them—this was the moment the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk would harvest them!  

"These villagers, ignoring the dangers of the mountain and treating their lives as trivial, deserve death!"  

The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s body radiated Buddhist light as he looked down and declared, "Those who deserve death must be slain. Only by eradicating all evildoers can the world be purified! This humble monk practices the Pure World Buddhist Path. Today, as the Wrathful Vajra, I shall exterminate you evil beings and cleanse this world!"  

His golden body, a hundred zhang tall, illuminated the heavens, casting light in all directions. Then, he chanted Buddhist verses that spread across villages for miles around.  

"This humble monk purifies the world here, slaying evil. What say the masses?"  

His voice echoed across hundreds of miles.  

Wherever it reached, the prayer beads made of human bones in the villagers’ hands glowed brightly.  

Instantly, the villagers prostrated themselves in worship, witnessing the divine miracle of the Buddhist light, their hearts filled with utmost piety!  

"May the Living Buddha slay the evil!"  

"May the Living Buddha slay the evil!"  

"May the Living Buddha slay the evil!"  

Countless prayers converged, the faith and wish power of the masses gathering upon him. At this moment, the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s golden body grew even more solid!  

His might was unparalleled, reaching its peak!  

Seizing the opportunity, the Fifth Helmsman demon immortal broke free from the Young Sect Master’s restraints, revealing its true form—over ten zhang tall, ferocious and menacing. It spoke with human words, mocking them relentlessly.  

"You came here to save these villagers, intending to slay the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk. Did you ever imagine that now, *you* are the evil ones? The masses now pray for the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk to slay *you*!"  

The yellow dog sneered, "Ignorant villagers, their lives worthless. Yet you sought to save them, only to die by their hands. Doesn’t that strike you as absurd?"  

"Shut your damn mouth!"  

Li Zhengjing exhaled sharply and turned to the Young Sect Master. "This evil monk has gathered the faith of the masses, boosting his power far beyond this old dog’s. If you can’t even take down this foul-mouthed mutt before I finish, it’ll tarnish the name of the Kunlun Young Sect Master!"  

"Can you handle this?"  

The Young Sect Master’s gaze was solemn as he looked at the hundred-zhang Buddhist light.  

"No problem!"  

Li Zhengjing stepped forward. "I’ll take down this brain-dead evil monk before you finish that dog!"  

Gripping the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber, he leaped into the air, facing the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s hundred-zhang golden body head-on!  

Twenty-five golden dragons surged around him, suppressing the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk!  

"This evil monk seems convinced he’s in the right—that he’s saving the world, cleansing evil, and restoring purity to the mortal realm," Yuan Zhengfeng remarked. "If you can break his Zen heart in debate, his power will crumble."  

"Debate a centuries-old idiot?" Li Zhengjing spat. "I’m afraid he’ll drag me into his delusional arguments and defeat me with his vast experience! He’s no ignorant child—trying to change his foolish beliefs is pointless..."  

"Then what’s your plan?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked.  

"I refuse to believe the faith and wish power of these villagers is infinite," Li Zhengjing said. "Within a mere hundred miles, the number of villagers is limited. His hundred-zhang golden body won’t last long! Let’s see who recovers faster—him or me!"  

"You’re going head-to-head with him?" Yuan Zhengfeng sounded shocked.  

"Don’t be fooled by his tough golden body. My endurance far surpasses his!"  

Li Zhengjing charged forward without hesitation, intent on wearing the monk down.  

The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk stretched out a hand, golden light erupting from his palm and covering an entire hill!  

Li Zhengjing didn’t dodge. As the golden light descended, he raised his left arm, unleashing the Divine Fire Sword!  

At the same time, the twenty-five golden dragons lunged, biting into the golden body and entangling it fiercely!  

In a single clash, Li Zhengjing was smashed into the ground, bones shattered.  

But the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk, distracted by the dragons and having used his palm’s Buddhist light to attack Li Zhengjing, left his defenses weakened. The Divine Fire Sword pierced through, its sword intent lingering as flames spread!  

"What a fool, trading severe injuries for a minor wound on the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk?"  

The Fifth Helmsman demon immortal sneered inwardly. It didn’t attack, focusing solely on defense and evasion to prolong the Young Sect Master’s efforts to kill it.  

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing, who had counterattacked, was already severely wounded after one exchange—on the verge of being crushed under the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s foot!  

Yet, to everyone’s shock, Li Zhengjing flipped back up and charged at the monk again!  

"What?!"  

The Fifth Helmsman was stunned—only to have its tail severed by the Young Sect Master’s sword in that instant, along with the hill behind it being split in two!  

The Young Sect Master remained expressionless. He already knew of Li Zhengjing’s Heavenly Azure Dao Body and that he wouldn’t die easily.  

He roughly understood Li Zhengjing’s strategy and realized that, with the Heavenly Azure Dao Body, victory was highly possible.  

Thus, his attacks grew even fiercer, determined to kill the Fifth Helmsman within fifteen minutes.  

On the other side, Li Zhengjing traded severe injuries for minor wounds—twelve times!  

By all logic, Li Zhengjing should have died at least seven or eight times by now. Yet he was still alive and kicking.  

In contrast, the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s hundred-zhang golden body dimmed further. Twelve minor wounds, left unhealed, now amounted to a severe injury!  

"Is that all?"  

Li Zhengjing sensed his surroundings and sneered. "The faith of the masses is nearly exhausted! The villagers are already mentally drained, too weak to cheer for you... After today, they’ll probably be bedridden for ten days to half a month!"  

He swung the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber five times, unleashing five thunderbolts!  

The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk could no longer heal his wounds, nor could he block the attacks.  

Each thunderbolt was stronger than the last!  

The twenty-five golden dragons held him in place!  

Unable to dodge, the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s left arm was struck five times in the same spot—and finally severed!  

The massive left arm, flickering with golden light, fell from his body. Before it hit the ground, the light faded, returning to normal size before splattering into minced meat under Li Zhengjing’s foot!  

"Evil demon, you’ve ruined my golden body!"  

The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk roared furiously. "This humble monk will purify the world! Slaughter all evil like you!"  

With that, he turned and fled!  

The yellow dog demon immortal was dumbfounded.  

The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk transformed into a streak of golden light, attempting to escape.  

"This humble monk is destined to be the Buddha who purifies the world—how can I die here?"  

"I must preserve my life, endure humiliation, advance my cultivation, and return to slay evil!"  

"I must not act recklessly now. The greater good must come first!"  

The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk thought to himself, *This humble monk is indifferent to life and death, unafraid of sacrifice. But for the sake of saving the world in the future, I willingly bear the shame of defeat and flee, allowing the world to mistake me for a coward... This is true endurance for the world’s sake, surpassing even the Buddha’s act of cutting his flesh to feed an eagle. I am the true Buddha of this world!*  

As these thoughts crossed his mind, golden light erupted from his body—he had an epiphany, and his Buddhist power advanced another step!  

But just as he fled, the twenty-five golden dragons blocked his path. The first to arrive bit down on his arms, shoulders, waist, and legs, suspending him mid-air!  

"Earlier, the faith of the masses blocked many of my attacks. Now, it’s just your own power. Let’s see how many strikes your fat-headed, squinty-eyed golden body can take!"  

Li Zhengjing advanced, activating the Feather Transformation Dragon Ascension Immortal Art. Over two hundred small dragons outside his body opened their mouths, unleashing sword qi that pierced the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk with hundreds of holes!  

He then swung the Five Thunder Mountain-Splitting Blade five more times, barely severing the monk’s other arm.  

His left arm’s Divine Fire erupted, finally piercing clean through the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk!  

"If not for those twenty-five golden dragons, you’d never be this humble monk’s match!"  

The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk roared, his eyes blazing with fury!  

Li Zhengjing’s eyes shone with golden light as they locked gazes.  

Sparks of golden flame scattered between them.  

Li Zhengjing stepped forward and said coolly, "If not for the faith of these ignorant villagers, how could you have matched me? If I’d cultivated as long as you, I’d have ascended to immortality long ago. Would I need to resort to harming mortals, deluding myself to grow stronger?"  

He stood before the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk and infused his voice with mana, letting it echo for miles:  

"The evil monk brings calamity, deceiving the masses, feasting on humans, crafting prayer beads from bones, corrupting all with evil energy!"  

"I, Li Zhengjing, slay this evil monk today. May the world awaken and suffer no more!"  

With a furious slash, he swung his saber horizontally. Thunder accompanied the blade’s arc, sweeping toward the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s neck!  

The world fell silent!  

Then came an enraged roar:  

"You dare kill me?!" The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s eyes bulged with fury.  

"Didn’t cut through?" Li Zhengjing blinked in surprise, looking at his Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber.  

"His golden body is too tough. Your blade skill isn’t perfected yet—you only left a gash, not a clean cut," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "Just use the Great Void Myriad Transformation Sword Qi or your left arm’s Divine Fire. One strike, and he’s done."  

"No! I refuse to believe I can’t behead him!" Li Zhengjing swung horizontally again—this time without even using the Five Thunder Mountain-Splitting Blade, relying purely on brute force.  

"..." The Giant Wrathful Evil Monk tilted his head slightly, his eyes now carrying a hint of pleading.  

"Still not through?!" Li Zhengjing sucked in a breath. "Back when I reached the peak of external martial arts, tempered by inner energy, refined by True Qi, and occasionally boosted by human immortal mana—my physical body was unparalleled! And my blade can’t even cut off his head?!"  

"..."  

After five slashes, the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk’s golden body finally crumbled, his head flying off. His eyes now held a trace of relief.  

"Such an unsatisfying fight." Li Zhengjing sighed.  

"He wasn’t satisfied either," Yuan Zhengfeng said, a hint of pity in his tone.  

"In the end, the Great Void Myriad Transformation Sword Qi is sharper. Once I reach human immortal realm and become a true sword immortal, a single sword qi should be enough to behead the Giant Wrathful Evil Monk cleanly. Then he’d die satisfied." Li Zhengjing muttered to himself.  

"Sadly, he’ll never experience the satisfaction you could’ve given him." Yuan Zhengfeng replied.  

"I hope he reincarnates and runs into me again, so I can make up for today’s disappointment." Li Zhengjing sighed, sheathing his saber and turning his gaze elsewhere.  

At that moment, the Young Sect Master bisected the yellow dog with a single slash.  

The upper half of the dog’s body plunged into a cliff face and vanished.  

But the Young Sect Master didn’t pursue. Instead, he looked up at Li Zhengjing and said, "My sword qi lingers on it. I’ll follow it to the Salvation Golden Ship’s location. Coming?"  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page’s fortune-telling and shook his head like a rattle-drum. "Nope, nope. I’ve got things to do... Take my advice—don’t go either..."
