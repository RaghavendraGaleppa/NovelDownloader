# Chapter 713: The Mirror of Inverted Fate

That was the sign of a Golden Core cultivator preliminarily manifesting their inner world outside—it signified the initial grasp of the Laws.

For one who had yet to form a Golden Core, even with combat prowess that could pierce the heavens, they were no different from ants trying to shake the sky before a true Golden Core Domain. There was an insurmountable chasm in the essence of their power.

"Still a step short, but your flattery is quite impressive."

Xu Yunfan finally raised his eyes, his gaze landing calmly on Han Shi. It was a look that looked down upon a speck of dust in the palm of his hand.

He slowly rose to his feet, hands clasped behind his back. The vast, starry sea-like pressure belonging to a Golden Core True Lord, no longer restrained, slammed down on Han Shi like a tangible mountain.

"When the Cangming Dao Fruit self-destructed to block Qingyuan and Huiri, I had already formed my Golden Core," Xu Yunfan's voice was flat and devoid of emotion.

"Giving you this body was an opportunity to continue your path of cultivation. It is a chance, not a shackle. You must understand this."

He took a step forward, and the thunder within the Divine Thunder Hall seemed to bow in submission.

"If you remain obstinate and deluded, attempting to throw an egg against a stone..."

Xu Yunfan slowly raised his right hand. A wisp of extremely fine yet incredibly condensed purple-gold lightning flickered at his fingertip, making a "crackling" sound.

It was this seemingly insignificant wisp of lightning that made Han Shi feel as if he had been plunged into an ice cave.

He felt the invisible Sword Soul, the core of his Annihilation Sword Intent, which had just condensed at his brow. Under the gaze of this wisp of lightning, it trembled violently, as if it would shatter completely in the next moment.

A fear originating from the very essence of his soul seized him. It was absolute suppression brought about by the difference in life levels.

"..."

All of Han Shi's anger, unwillingness, and humiliation were forcefully crushed back into his chest before this absolute disparity in power.

His face turned deathly pale, his body stiffened. The knuckles of his clenched fists turned white, but he could no longer凝聚起 a single shred of sword intent.

The sense of power brought by his Innate Sword Body vanished without a trace, leaving only deep powerlessness and terror.

He finally realized with absolute clarity that the person before him was no longer the opponent in his memory, but a true Golden Core True Lord who had stepped into the peak of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

The power he was so proud of, in the other's eyes, was truly just the struggle of an ant.

Watching the anger in Han Shi's eyes extinguish and the inescapable fear appear, the lightning at Xu Yunfan's fingertip quietly vanished.

The pressure eased slightly, but the aura as high and unshakable as the firmament still enveloped the hall.

"Tongxuan has already fallen in the Sea of Bitterness, his soul utterly destroyed. Chiyang True Lord is also dead. His Dao Fruit of the Blazing Sun of Separated Light has been refined by me, becoming the Dao of Thunder and Fire."

Han Shi was shocked to hear this. He truly hadn't expected that during the time he was trapped within the Star Spirit Banner with his consciousness blurred, such earth-shattering events had occurred.

It took him a long while before he said with a涩 tone, "You have killed two True Lords of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. The Sword Sect will surely not let you off!"

Xu Yunfan gave a light laugh and didn't bother to say more.

After all, the Ancestor Lu Chunyang was now the Sect Master of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, overseeing the entire Southern Continent, and had established the Twelve Heavenly Pillar Sword Peaks. As long as he didn't make a move, the other True Lords, such as Qixia and Tianguang, would have to think twice before acting.

Sword Cultists were indeed known as the number one in killing and warfare in the world, even within the Golden Core realm.

But Xu Yunfan was Xu Yunfan. Whether it was his true cultivation or other peerless arts, he had cultivated them to perfection and subtlety. Even the creators of these arts would be inferior to him.

What was there to fear from Sword Cultists?

Xu Yunfan turned his body, his gaze falling on Han Shi.

"This body is given to you. It is a sword, and also a path. How to walk it is up to you."

He paused, his tone turning cold. "But remember, your true spirit origin is tied to the Star Spirit Banner. Do not do anything foolish."

Han Shi's body trembled again. He lowered his head to look at his new, cold, and powerful body, his expression extremely complex.

His hatred had not yet dissipated, and the fear was still there. But before this absolute power, he had no way to resist.

Xu Yunfan had already become a Golden Core True Lord. Although he himself was only half a step away, even the Cangming Return to Void Dao Fruit had turned its gaze and favored him.

But if the Dao Fruit was not yet proven, then there was still a heaven-and-earth difference between him and a Golden Core.

But how could proving the Dao Fruit be so easy?

Xu Yunfan was a prime example. Not to mention the Heavenly Dao of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World descending tribulations, but just those Golden Core True Lords who disregarded martial ethics and took advantage of others' peril were all capable hands.

In the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, such scoundrels who beat up newbies with max-level divine gear were everywhere.

The hall fell into a momentary silence. Only the purple-gold thunder flowed silently between the pillars.

Xu Yunfan no longer paid attention to Han Shi. His spiritual sense sank into the Star Spirit Banner again, deducing repair schemes while reviewing his gains from the Sea of Bitterness.

He also began to ponder how to refine another functional treasure that could allow a physical body to enter the Sea of Bitterness of Samsara.

Three years passed in a flash.

Inside the Divine Thunder Palace, Han Shi stood below the main seat. The newly forged Innate Sword Body exuded a sharp, chilling aura, but deep within his dark golden pupils凝结着 an unresolved gloom.

Three years of nurturing his sword intent. The body, forged from Ten Thousand Year Sword Marrow Jade for bones and North Sea Cold Iron for meridians, had become one with his Anger-Killing Sword Intent. Yet, whenever he looked at the figure on the cloud platform, the sword qi surging through his meridians would act like a caged beast.

He finally raised his head.

"You want me to use this body. What exactly do you want from me?"

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes from his deduction. The Star Spirit Banner in his palm shimmered with a dark light.

"Enter the Sea of Bitterness of Samsara and retrieve the Dao Fruit of the Dark Yin Mysterious Qilin."

"The Netherworld?!"

Han Shi's shoulder bones instantly tensed, his pupils constricting violently.

"A living being entering the Netherworld will definitely face backlash. You want me to send me to my death?"

"If I only needed someone to die, why would I need to耗费 Ten Thousand Year Sword Marrow Jade to forge this Dao Body for you?"

Xu Yunfan said, "Previously, I saw someone forcibly cross the Sea of Bitterness with their physical body. The technique they used, 'Life and Death Reversal, Yin and Yang Chaos,' was excellent. I have some insights into it now."

He pinched a wisp of gray, withered aura with his fingertips. It was the residual spiritual power of the White-Haired True Lord that the Star Spirit Banner had brought back from the Sea of Bitterness three years ago.

Over the past three years, Xu Yunfan had used the Attribute Panel to deduce it tens of thousands of times. He finally deconstructed and reconstructed the nature of this power that reversed life and death, refining it into a dark, ancient mirror.

The back of the mirror was based on Soul-Nourishing Wood Heart, inlaid with seven North Sea玄 Crystals that reversed Yin and Yang. The surface was engraved with patterns of Qilin scales, faintly showing a cold, clear brilliance.

"Hold this Mirror of Inverted Fate."

Xu Yunfan tossed the ancient mirror to Han Shi.

"It can deceive the laws of the Netherworld and protect your physical body for passage."

Han Shi silently caught it, the knuckles of his fingers gripping the mirror turning white.

Xu Yunfan had already arranged everything.

The mirror reflected his cold, sword-like face, as well as the pair of eyes on the cloud platform that were devoid of any ripples.

Just like when the Star Spirit Banner imprisoned his true spirit back then, it made the flames of hatred burn his soul.

Xu Yunfan's voice rang out, "Daoist Han, if this mission succeeds, I will grant you your freedom."

Han Shi's expression shifted slightly, and finally, a few traces of mockery appeared.

"Baiting me with freedom to make me闯 a place of ten deaths and no life..."

A low sneer rolled in his throat, "Xu Yunfan, you haven't changed at all."

Xu Yunfan looked out of the hall with his hands behind his back, his expression calm.

"If I obtain the Dao Fruit this time, I will give you a chance to be剥离 from the Star Banner. If I fail..."

His voice suddenly carried a hint of coldness.

"Then, just like Wukong, return to the banner and be my Dao友."

The mountain peak's gale winds howled fiercely. Han Shi's black robes fluttered like wings hanging from the sky.

He glanced one last time at the Qilin phantom coiling on the back of the mirror, then leaped into the Gate of Samsara.

The Yin-Yang runes on the back of the mirror suddenly lit up, wrapping him in a gray light as he disappeared into the temporal storm that tore at the soul.
