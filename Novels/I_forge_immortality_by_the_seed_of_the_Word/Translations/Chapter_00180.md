# Chapter 177

Sitting before my computer until past 3 AM, I stared blankly at the plot outline and chapter summaries, managing to write barely five hundred words. The remaining two chapters totaling five thousand words for today's update will likely be delayed.

My apologies, dear readers. This humble author hasn't been in top form these past couple days, leading to somewhat unstable updates...

The handover of my current job will likely take another week or two to complete (as it involves hazardous materials, we can't leave any loose ends that might lead to accountability issues).

Once the transition is complete, I'll devote myself fully to writing and strive to make up for all missed updates.

That's all for now.

My deepest bows to you all!
