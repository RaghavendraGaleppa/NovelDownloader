# Chapter 575: The Formation Rises and Falls

The power capable of tearing apart mountains was rapidly消散 under the continuous cutting and decomposition.

The vast quantity of Hundred-Forged Demonic Qi was shattered by the refinement of the pure Thunder Evil.

"Waaa!"

Sun Qishan's massive body arched suddenly, the blood draining from his face.

His arms trembled violently, his tiger's mouth split open, and紫 black demonic blood flowed freely.

The bone in his arms, as sturdy as a magic treasure, emitted faint cracking sounds.

The opponent's method of using the Thunder Formation as a shield was truly miraculous. Borrowing force to strike back, using a hundredfold or thousandfold sharpness to consume and counter, it had completely neutralized his pure power attack and反震ed it back onto himself.

The Dao Foundation he believed to be indestructible now showed cracks under that single slash.

The combined thunderous strike of the three was actually blocked by Xu Yunfan with just one formation and one method. Moreover, in an instant, it left all three of them injured to varying degrees.

"This is the Divine Thunder Scripture?!"

"How can the coordination of the formation be so powerful?!"

Zhao Moyang's heart was stirred into towering waves. Fear, terror, and a deeper greed intertwined.

He could see that Xu Yunfan's aura had temporarily risen due to a secret technique, but this divine ability combining the formation disc with the Thunder Method was exquisite beyond imagination, its power far exceeding his expectations and vastly surpassing the limits of the mid Foundation Establishment realm.

If the cultivation method wasn't逆天, how could this be possible?!

He must obtain this True Scripture, no matter the cost.

If Xu Yunfan knew what Zhao Moyang was thinking, he would surely look at the other party with considerable pity.

It is the person who is strong, not the Scripture.

Even if Zhao Moyang obtained the complete Scripture, without attainments in the Dao of Formations, without proficiency in the changes of the Thunder Method, and without the assistance of the attribute panel to perfect every promotion, how could he possess such strength now?

Xu Yunfan gave them no chance to catch their breath or reorganize their attack.

In the instant the three were stumbling from their injuries and their minds were seized, Xu Yunfan's main hand seal technique changed again.

Then, a brilliant purple mark between his eyebrows shone brightly, as if resonating with the core eye of the entire Sky-Locking Formation.

"The Zodiac Star Wheel, the Nine Firmaments take their positions, the Myriad Thunders pay homage to the Ancestor!"

A cold, solemn command echoed through the Thunder Formation space.

*Hum! Boom!*

The Five Thunders Inverted Origin Sky-Locking Formation erupted with its most violent finale.

The entire formation, like a massive thunder核反应堆, collapsed inward and lit up.

The light screen covering a thousand丈 compressed inward to a hundred丈.

The 360 Heavenly Gang Thunder Evil Pearls suddenly merged into one.

They condensed into a terrifying thunder slurry vortex the size of several丈, like a miniature thunder pool.

At the center of the vortex, it was no longer a deep purple thunder ball, but a ball burning with紫 golden flames.

The Purple Micro Heavenly Emperor Thunder.

The millstone shield formed by the Zodiac Destruction Thunder Net instantly disintegrated, transforming into billions of even more violent and finer threads of destruction. Like a storm sweeping through, they cut and ground towards the three within the formation without distinction.

Zhao Moyang was the first to bear the brunt.

Facing this thunder evil storm that seemed to be the crushing weight of heaven and earth, he let out a miserable shriek. His Black Yin Robe instantly swelled to its limit, spewing out sticky, ink-jade-like Black Yin demonic light, forming layer upon layer of turtle-shell-like protective barriers.

This was the strongest defensive Dao Technique from his *Black Yin Soul-Slaying True Scripture*, the Black Yin Sea-Covering Shield.

*Zzzzz!*

The moment the ink-jade shield touched the all-encompassing紫 golden thunder threads, it emitted a piercing sound of消融, like a hot knife cutting through butter.

The erosion and plundering characteristics of the Black Yin Qi, in the face of the极致 pure Purple Micro Heavenly Emperor Thunder containing the will of thunderous destruction, were like the mud in a ditch under the暴晒 of the true sun from the nine heavens, utterly useless.

Layer after layer of ink-jade barriers疯狂 disintegrated and消融ed.

"Block it! Block it for me!" Zhao Moyang, his eyes bursting with rage,不顾 the consumption of his origin and spurted精 blood into the shield.

But the thunder thread storm was pervasive, having already pierced the outer barriers. Its terrifying power, coupled with the inherent paralyzing properties of thunder, made his soul feel as if pierced by ten thousand needles. His reaction speed and the flow of his magical power dropped significantly.

An endless fear surged in his heart. This Thunder Method was too克制 to his cultivation method.

Leng Yuehua's surroundings surged with cold air. Countless tiny ice spikes and thorns凝聚ed out of thin air, swirling around her like a snowstorm, while her figure rapidly退ed, trying to avoid the锋芒 of the thunder net.

However, the thunder thread storm covered the entire compressed space, leaving no room for evasion.

The ice spikes and thorns made a sound like glass shattering the moment they touched the紫 golden thunder threads,爆裂ing and汽化ing one after another.

Her protective ice domain波动ed violently, ice shards飞溅ed, and was instantly torn open in several places.

Several紫 golden thunder threads, like venomous snakes,钻入 the gaps and狠狠抽打 on her protective spiritual light.

"Pfft!"

Leng Yuehua's delicate body trembled violently. A flush of unnatural crimson appeared on her frost-covered face. She opened her mouth and spurted a mist of blood exuding寒气. Her aura visibly withered.

The spiritual light of her Silver Thread Cloud Flowing Skirt dimmed, and the hem even showed signs of scorching and curling.

Her spiritual sea was also in agony. The backlash from the return of the Green Bamboo Small Sword, its spiritual nature greatly damaged, had not yet subsided, and new injuries were added.

Sun Qishan was the most miserable.

He had been charging head-on and was the closest to Xu Yunfan. The central might of the thunder net storm was mostly倾泻ed upon him.

"Awwoooo!!!" He let out a beast-like roar,不顾 the tearing pain in his arms, and疯狂ly waved the heavy,乌黑 great-axe,搅动 a gale of blood-evil demonic Qi, trying to劈开 this deadly thunder evil storm.

But the great-axe moved with extreme difficulty within the storm. Every swing felt like挥舞 in a thick, heavy thunder marsh.

Every thread of紫 golden thunder that缠绕ed the axe blade and his arms brought钻心蚀骨的麻痹 and剧痛. Moreover, the pervasive destruction thunder意 was侵蚀ing his demonic body and Dao Foundation.

The protective blood-evil demonic light was repeatedly cut and钻透ed by countless thunder threads, like being凌迟ed by a thousand small knives, rapidly becoming full of holes.

"Ughhh!"

On Sun Qishan's massive body, his knotted muscles不断抽搐 under the thunder light. Areas struck by the lightning turned焦黑. The metallic luster of his skin裂开 with焦痕 deep enough to see bone.紫 black demonic blood gushed out, only to be instantly汽化ed into a foul-smelling blood mist by the high temperature.

Like a beast driven into a corner, he let out痛苦的嘶吼. The ferocity in his eyes was replaced by难以掩饰的痛苦 and a hint of panic.

The thunder sea churned, the storm raged.

In just a few breaths, the compressed hundred-zhang space of the Sky-Locking Formation was already一片狼藉.

Zhao Moyang was in a wretched state. His Black Yin Robe was torn in multiple places, his ink-black long hair was枯焦 and disheveled, and his handsome face was streaked with black marks from the thunder evil. His aura was极其萎靡, relying entirely on burning his origin精 blood to maintain his摇摇欲坠的 Black Yin shield. Every冲击 of the thunder threads made his body震 violently, causing him to spurt blood.

Leng Yuehua's frozen mask was completely shattered. Her face was惨白 like paper, her silver skirt was焦黑, and her aura was weak as she伏 on a ground of frozen and then shattered ice crystals. The Green Bamboo Small Sword lay powerlessly beside her, its blade's spiritual light almost extinguished.

Sun Qishan was the most惨烈. His body半跪ed on the ground, the great-axe杵ed before him, barely supporting him from falling.

There was not a single完好 spot on his entire body.焦黑 skin and wounds deep enough to see bone were everywhere. Demonic blood浸染ed the ground, forming a small pool of blood. He panted heavily, each breath accompanied by blood foam. His粗犷 face now only held绝望的虚弱 and痛苦.
