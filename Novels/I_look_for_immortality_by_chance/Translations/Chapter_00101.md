# Chapter 101: The Enemy of Luoxia Sect

Upon hearing Bian Chuyao's words, Gu Yuan burst into laughter.

"Without drawing a single sword or blade, just a few words and you want my treasure? Junior Sister, you're the real bandit cultivator here!"

"Bah! You're the bandit cultivator! I'm doing this for your own good. These Green Lotus seeds have extremely stringent growing conditions—they can only survive in places with rich spiritual veins. Thanks to my grandfather's favor, I have the Yuanyun Valley in Yunxuan Island as my base. There, the Green Lotus will definitely thrive. Once it's grown, we can share the seeds!"

Bian Chuyao wore a gentle smile, her demeanor exuding the confidence of someone from a prestigious family as she earnestly explained to Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan pondered for a moment.

Handing over the Green Lotus seeds to Bian Chuyao for cultivation was out of the question. Though Yunxuan Island was a good place, it belonged to the Bian family. If something went wrong, could he really storm a third-grade spiritual island to demand them back?

However, from what Bian Chuyao said, it seemed that successfully cultivating the Green Lotus seeds could yield more than one seed. If that were the case, perhaps they could strike a deal.

With this in mind, his eyes gleamed as he smiled and said, "No need to worry about the cultivation, Junior Sister. I'll handle it myself. What I'm curious about is—since you're so concerned about the Dao Unity Green Lotus seeds, do you perhaps possess ancient seals but lack the means to refine them?"

Seeing the flicker in Gu Yuan's eyes, Bian Chuyao suddenly grew wary and fell silent.

"Don't be nervous, Junior Sister. I did obtain these seeds partly thanks to you. So why don't we make a deal?" Gu Yuan suggested with a smile.

"What kind of deal?"

"I'll cultivate the seeds. If multiple seeds are produced, I can share some with you. In return, you can teach me how to refine a few of those ancient seals."

Gu Yuan waved his sleeve, speaking as if it were a casual matter.

Hearing this, Bian Chuyao nearly laughed in disbelief.

Ancient seals? And several of them? 

Wasn't he afraid of choking on his own words?

But after a moment's thought, her anger subsided as she considered the situation.

Given this scoundrel's selfish and untrusting nature, he would never willingly hand over the Green Lotus seeds to her. 

Unless they resorted to force and involved her family, obtaining the seeds would be impossible. 

But that would be the worst approach. Though this villain had a despicable character, his talent and methods were undeniably exceptional. In a way, his temperament was better suited to the cultivation world. Had it not been for him today, she would have fallen prey to bandit cultivators on White Tiger Ridge.

Such a person had a high chance of reaching Foundation Establishment. In the future, he might even become an ally in her bid for the position of True Disciple. To sever ties completely over the Green Lotus seeds would be unwise and contrary to the Bian family's principles.

Why turn a potential friendship into enmity when goodwill could be bought with wealth?

However... that ancient seal was truly problematic.

After some internal struggle, Bian Chuyao finally lifted her chin and sneered, "Let's see if you can even cultivate the Green Lotus seeds first. If you fail, my offer to help still stands—just come to Yunxuan Island."

She refused to believe Gu Yuan could succeed. If he failed, he would have to beg her for help, and then she would hold all the cards.

"Then it's settled!" Gu Yuan smiled, accepting the agreement.

"Hmph! You'll definitely come crawling to me!" Bian Chuyao wrinkled her nose, her tone haughty.

"If that day comes, I'll personally visit to apologize and beg for your assistance." Gu Yuan laughed, unbothered by her attitude.

As long as he could gain benefits, what did it matter if Bian Chuyao had the upper hand in words?

"Let's not delay—we should head to Yunlan Valley immediately!" Having resolved this matter, Gu Yuan urged them to move.

"Yes, yes! To Yunlan Valley!" Bian Chuyao snapped out of her thoughts and eagerly agreed, no longer dwelling on hypothetical future scenarios.

The two then worked together to break through the encirclement of demonic beasts, returning to Bian Chuyao's original route toward Yunlan Valley.

Yet Bian Chuyao couldn't shake a strange feeling. Gu Yuan seemed even more eager than her to reach the valley, his sword flashing as demonic beasts fell one after another.

"Is this scoundrel planning to pull another trick like before?" Suspicious, she stayed close to Gu Yuan, wary that he might vanish in an instant.

As her thoughts wandered, the jade hall from before reappeared before them.

---

Inside the jade hall, the scar-faced Daoist from the Duzhen Star Formation appeared once more, and Bian Chuyao found herself bound to a jade pillar again.

"To save her, lay down your—"

"Pfft!"

Before the scar-faced Daoist could finish his threat, Gu Yuan's sword pierced the forehead of the "Bian Chuyao" illusion, killing her instantly.

A thick mist rose, and sword light blazed. Within moments, the scar-faced Daoist was also slain.

The illusion of the jade hall dissipated, and Gu Yuan found himself before a stone cave, the scene eerily similar to the Duzhen Star Formation.

It took a while before Bian Chuyao finally appeared beside him.

"You're rather slow, Junior Sister. At this rate, we'll be late to Yunlan Valley..." Gu Yuan frowned slightly and sighed.

"Hmph! Not everyone is as heartless as you, killing without hesitation!" Bian Chuyao's face flushed briefly before she regained her composure, shooting him a glare.

After their time together, she had come to realize the gap in their temperaments. Breaking through illusions took her longer.

But why was this bodyguard so impatient? Why was he in more of a hurry than her?

Gu Yuan chuckled, his demeanor steady once more. Without pressing further, he turned his gaze to the stone cave and asked Bian Chuyao:

"Junior Sister, beyond this lies Yunlan Valley. Now, can you tell me—will we encounter others in the valley?"

He had his own plans and considered this information more crucial than before.

Knowing the enemy was half the battle.

Seeing no reason to withhold the truth now, Bian Chuyao answered plainly, "I can't say for certain. But if we do, they'll undoubtedly be elite disciples from the Yanlei Peak lineage of Luoxia Sect."

"The Flowing Flame Golden Fruit is extraordinary. With it, one has a ninety-nine percent chance of refining the Solar Yang Golden Qi and achieving Foundation Establishment, provided they comprehend the required techniques."

"Years ago, my grandfather and the master of Yanlei Peak participated in the war that destroyed Zhongshan Kingdom. Both discovered the sapling of this Flowing Flame Golden Fruit. However, the kingdom was hastily banished to the Land of Annihilation, and the fruit couldn't be transplanted—it could only survive on the golden-fire spiritual veins of Yunlan Valley."

"So, my grandfather and the Yanlei Peak master set up this contingency. Each crafted two jade tokens, agreeing that when the fruit ripened, their descendants could enter the mountain and compete for it, using their own skills to claim it and achieve Foundation Establishment."

"By my calculations, the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit should be nearing maturity. That's why my grandfather gave me the jade token."

"However, this matter must not be known by other direct descendants of Golden Core cultivators, lest it interfere with my bid for the Solar Yang Golden Qi bestowed by the Dao Academy. That's why I chose you to accompany me."

"If the Yanlei Peak disciple has also entered Yunlan Valley, they must have brought a talented rogue cultivator skilled in combat."

"Once we enter the valley, I can handle the Yanlei Peak disciple. But the person they invited... that will be your responsibility, Senior Brother. Are you confident?"

At the end, Bian Chuyao fixed a piercing gaze on Gu Yuan, as if deciding whether to trust him.

Gu Yuan merely asked calmly:

"Can I kill them and take their storage pouches?"

Bian Chuyao's solemn expression collapsed instantly, and she couldn't help but facepalm.
