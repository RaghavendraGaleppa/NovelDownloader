# Chapter 66: The Fairy of the Clouds

The elite disciples possessed remarkable cultivation levels, yet among these thirty-some individuals, female cultivators were few in number. Though scarce, these blossoms amidst the foliage stood out brilliantly.

"Hmm, why hasn't Junior Sister Qin arrived?"

"Not sure, but since Elder Li is lecturing today, she should come, right?"

"That's not certain. Though Junior Sister Qin has been with the sect for only a short time, her cultivation is profound. She might be in seclusion again."

...

The female disciples whispered among themselves, drawing the attention of even the most arrogant elite disciples. Even the two most accomplished experts at the Great Perfection stage turned their heads.

Lin Xuan mimicked the others' reactions but inwardly sighed. That Junior Sister Qin truly had a formidable reputation!

The disciple they referred to was named Qin Yan, who had entered the valley at the same time as Lin Xuan four years ago. Yet their fates had diverged drastically.

Lin Xuan lacked spiritual roots, remaining an ordinary mortal. His cultivation progressed at a snail's pace, and despite exerting ten times the effort of others, he had been left far behind by his peers.

Qin Yan, however, was the exact opposite. Blessed with exceptional spiritual roots, she grasped every technique and secret method instantly, able to deduce the rest from a single instance. She was hailed as the sect's once-in-centuries genius, adorned with countless accolades.

In less than four years since joining the Piaoyun Valley, Qin Yan had already reached the Great Perfection stage of the Lingdong Realm. Her future foundation establishment was a foregone conclusion, and some elders even speculated she might become the sect's next Core Formation expert after Elder Yunhe.

The foremost among low-level disciples!

Moreover, she was naturally beautiful, with especially fair skin, earning her the nickname "Fairy of the Clouds."

She was the dream lover of many male disciples, immensely popular. Unfortunately, Qin Yan was cold and aloof, devoted solely to cultivation, showing no favor to anyone, let alone allowing anyone to get close.

In Piaoyun Valley, some might be confused about who the sect leader was, but the name "Fairy of the Clouds" was universally known.

As the female disciples chatted, a fragrant breeze wafted in, and a stunning young woman entered the hall. She appeared to be around seventeen or eighteen, with peerless beauty and skin like jade.

"Gulp!" Lin Xuan heard a male disciple nearby swallow hard.

"Junior Sister Qin!"

The previously aloof elite disciples immediately set aside their pride, greeting Qin Yan with deference.

Yet Qin Yan remained cold and indifferent, ignoring them all as she walked past. Far from offending the elite male disciples, her attitude only intensified their fervor.

Lin Xuan frowned. What was the point? Qin Yan might be beautiful, but she was unattainable. Why waste effort? Among the male disciples present were many popular figures who had the affection of other junior sisters, yet they scorned those who admired them, only to fawn over Qin Yan and be rebuffed.

Lin Xuan didn't believe this was solely due to Qin Yan's spiritual roots and beauty. After all, Piaoyun Valley had other attractive female disciples, and as for cultivation—what did that have to do with love?

The key was that the unattainable was always the most desirable. This inexplicable notion influenced everyone's mindset.

Though he disapproved of the male disciples' behavior, Lin Xuan played along to avoid standing out, offering a greeting to the Fairy of the Clouds. The result was the same—he was ignored, and he earned disdainful glances from several female disciples.

Lin Xuan inwardly sighed at his misfortune.

The other male disciples persisted, showering her with nauseating flattery. Lin Xuan noticed that while the Fairy of the Clouds maintained her cold demeanor, her eyes betrayed her irritation. No one enjoyed being pestered by flies, which explained why she had arrived late.

Fortunately, the situation didn't last long. After another five or six minutes, an elder entered the hall.

He appeared to be in his fifties or sixties, though his actual age was certainly much older. Cultivators absorbed spiritual energy from heaven and earth, aging much slower.

For instance, a mature and beautiful woman at the Core Formation stage might well be over two hundred years old.

Depending on the cultivation techniques they practiced, each cultivator aged at a different rate. Some legendary techniques and elixirs could even allow cultivators to retain their youthful appearance throughout their lives.

Of course, not all cultivators preferred to look young. While women cherished beauty, many male experts believed a youthful face paired with white hair exuded authority and had little interest in preserving their looks.

This was the Elder Li everyone spoke of, but contrary to Lin Xian's expectations, this expert at the Great Perfection stage of Foundation Establishment had a sly, rat-like appearance and a short stature, lacking any imposing presence.

Yet appearances could be deceiving, and Lin Xian dared not underestimate him. He bowed respectfully along with the other disciples.

Elder Li surveyed the disciples before him, nodded in satisfaction, and took a seat at the front, closing his eyes to meditate.

Lin Xian was puzzled. Wasn't today supposed to be his lecture? Why...

Though confused, Lin Xian remained still, observing how others would react.

"Elder, this disciple has recently felt abdominal pain during cultivation. Could there be an error in my method?" A disciple in the second row stood up and asked respectfully.

Elder Li opened his eyes and glanced at him indifferently. "Hmm, sixth-level cultivation, currently attempting to break through to Great Perfection, correct?"

"Yes!"

"You're too impatient. Your Dao heart is unstable, and spiritual energy has accumulated in your abdomen. Rest for now and consolidate your sixth-level foundation."

"Thank you for your guidance, Elder." The disciple bowed deeply and sat down.

Then another disciple stood up.

...

So this was how it worked. Before the lecture, disciples would raise their cultivation issues. Lin Xian was delighted—he had been worried about the time limit of his disguise technique, and this arrangement suited him perfectly.
