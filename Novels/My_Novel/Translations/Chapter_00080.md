# Chapter 80: Perils from All Sides, Solidifying the Blood

The feast lasted until late into the night. Li Xian was completely stuffed. He covered the leftover tiger carcass with snow and left it in the courtyard before going to bed.

He slept soundly. His first night in Heihe Village passed peacefully.

The next morning, a rooster crowed from the east.

Li Xian stretched, his bones making a series of popping sounds. Though he was only fifteen and came from a poor family, by utilizing various resources, he had managed to build a robust and strong physique.

It had snowed last night.

Yet, Li Xian felt no cold at all; in fact, he even broke a slight sweat. He attributed this to the pure yang beast he had consumed, which helped him ward off the chill.

He had long since developed the habit of a morning run to invigorate his blood and qi. Splashing his face with snow, he felt a jolt of energy throughout his body.

Then, he began his martial arts practice.

[You rose with the rooster to practice, training diligently in the fist art. Proficiency +1]

[You faced the sun and threw your punches, channeling your blood and qi. Proficiency +1]

The morning sun's halo shone upon Li Xian.

The Four Directions Fist was already at Perfection. Now, as he挥舞ed it, it carried considerable momentum and a unique flair that was entirely his own.

"While I was at the manor, I had to hide my abilities and couldn't show my perfected fist art."

"Here in Heihe Village, I am free and unrestrained, so I can practice my fist art to my heart's content."

Li Xian deeply appreciated the rarity of such freedom.

[Four Directions Fist]
[Proficiency: 499/10000 (Perfection)]

He practiced his martial arts to the fullest, completely undisturbed and free from duties like patrolling.

He practiced continuously until noon.

[Four Directions Fist]
[Proficiency: 568/10000 (Perfection)]

This solid progress filled him with joy. Wiping away his sweat, Li Xian ate some tiger meat and then went to find Uncle Fu in the village.

"Uncle, are you settling in well?"

Seeing Li Xian arrive, Uncle Fu didn't dare to be negligent.

"It's alright," Li Xian said. "I'm new here and not very familiar with the area. I'd like to ask Uncle Fu to send someone to show me around."

"I can do it myself. I grew up here, who could be more familiar than me?" Uncle Fu replied.

"I'm afraid it might be too taxing on your health," Li Xian said with a smile. "I need to conduct a field inspection, which will involve climbing mountains and crossing rivers."

"Ah!" Uncle Fu exclaimed in surprise. "You... you mean you want to leave the village?"

He said seriously, "Uncle, I'm not trying to stop you, but there are many tigers in these forests. The last guard... he died a tragic death in a tiger's mouth."

"Besides the tigers, there's no shortage of human trouble. There's the Mountain Wind Stronghold up in the nearby mountains, and they're fierce, I tell you. And by the river, there's the Black Water Gang, also fierce, killing without blinking an eye."

Li Xian said, "I mainly want to check the farmland and the nearby areas for water and firewood. There's no need to worry."

Hearing this, Uncle Fu finally felt reassured. He was too old to personally guide and explain things, so he called his son, a man in his forties named Fukang, to lead the way.

"Uncle, please come with me," Fukang said with a bow.

The duties of an externally驻守的护院 (guard) were to watch over the firewood and forests, and to protect the fields and the village.

Villages are divided into rich and poor. Being stationed in a wealthy village is a comfortable life. Being stationed in a poor village, however, is fraught with danger.

Heihe Village had three thousand acres of land, all belonging to the Madam. Its hundred or so households were all her tenant farmers.

The farmland was at the eastern exit of the village and lay fallow for the winter. The place for fetching water was a small stream on a neighboring mountain.

The stream gurgled year-round and was vital to the villagers.

"Brother Fukang, what do you think is the most dangerous thing?" Li Xian asked casually.

"Dangerous?" Fukang thought for a moment. "There's too much of that. People die in our village every year."

"Dangers are many. Wild beasts and venomous snakes are secondary; the key threats are the people from the Mountain Wind Stronghold and the Black Water Gang. They're the ones who really push people to their deaths."

"The Black Water Gang guards the water source, leaving us with no water to use. The Mountain Wind Stronghold comes down the mountain to rob grain. Our harvest was already meager, and then they plunder it clean."

"If you refuse to give them grain, they'll beat you to death. If you do give it... you might still freeze or starve to death."

"Fortunately, there are some fruits in the forest. When you're truly desperate, you can find people to go up the mountain together to pick some fruit to fill your stomach."

"It offers a slim chance of survival."

"But then again, when you go up the mountain to pick fruit, the wild beasts won't be polite. Sigh."

As they were talking, the two of them arrived at a gully.

Fukang pointed downwards. "This used to be a river, but the neighboring Chihe Village, relying on the fact that their village head is related to a flag-bearer in the Black Water Gang..."

"They had their villagers secretly dig a channel to divert the river."

"Heh, they actually succeeded. Now we're left with no water and have to go begging them for it."

The riverbed was a good seven or eight yards wide, extending deep into the mountains.

Li Xian bent down to observe and found that the riverbed was dry, with lush vegetation inside, as if it were spring. Yet, just a few yards away on both banks, the ground was covered with a blanket of snow.

He reached out and held his hand over the riverbed.

He sensed a faint warmth.

"Uncle, did you notice something unusual?" Fukang asked.

"Nothing," Li Xian replied. "The vegetation here is so lush. Aren't you curious?"

Fukang said, "What's there to be curious about?"

He had never given it much thought.

"Fair enough."

Li Xian stopped asking. For these villagers, even getting enough to eat and drink was a problem; the word "curiosity" was far too much of a luxury.

A tiger soup was simmering in the stove.

In the courtyard.

Li Xian was practicing his fist art with dedication.

His initial exploration revealed that Heihe Village harbored many dangers. The only way to ensure his own safety was to quickly improve his strength.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]

Li Xian brought his fists together and struck out.

After reaching Perfection in the Four Directions Fist, his punches were fluid and effortless, giving him a feeling of natural comfort.

He used both hands to execute the fist art, employing his mind for two tasks at once, doubling its power.

[Four Directions Fist]
[Proficiency: 620/10000 (Perfection)]

He practiced until his hands trembled and his bones ached. Then, Li Xian switched to leg techniques, practicing the Breeze Leg, using the wind from his kicks to clear the snow from the courtyard.

[Breeze Leg]
[Proficiency: 345/5000 (Great Mastery)]

[Emerald Green Palm]
[Proficiency: 219/2000 (Proficiency)]

For an ordinary martial artist, it's not advisable to practice too many martial arts in one day. Otherwise, their blood and qi could become chaotic, achieving the opposite effect. If they were to mix up the forms, there was even a risk of crippling their martial arts.

Practicing one or two arts was sufficient.

Li Xian had the "Heaven's Reward for Diligence," so he wasn't bound by this restriction. However, within the twelve hours of a day, including the "Great Luo Saber," he had four martial arts to practice.

If he spread his efforts evenly, he could make progress on all fronts, but it would inevitably slow down his advancement.

"Instead, I should focus my time on two specific martial arts each day."

Li Xian made up his mind.

He would dedicate his time to the "Four Directions Fist" and the "Breeze Leg." These were the first two martial arts he had learned, and they had accompanied him as his situation improved.

From the lowest grade to the second-highest grade. Now, though he is still at the second-highest grade while stationed elsewhere, he is actually on par with the highest grade, because only guards of the highest grade are qualified for external postings.

"The Four Directions Fist is close to reaching its peak. I want to see what the peak looks like."

"And the Breeze Leg can boost my speed. If I encounter danger in the future, it will increase my chances of escaping."

"It's a pity about the Emerald Green Palm, a superior martial art... it makes my heart itch."

"But one eats a meal bite by bite, and one practices martial arts step by step. During my time stationed here, I... can practice all these martial arts one by one!"

His mind was clear, and his fist paths became more direct.

He practiced until night fell.

Li Xian discovered that his efficiency had significantly improved.

Although a second-highest grade guard only needs to patrol for two hours, the manor has a rule: once night falls, guards who are not on duty are not allowed to go out and wander.

Therefore, the only real time for martial arts practice was during the day. By the time evening came, he had to fetch water, wash up, eat... factoring in these零碎 (零碎) times, the time available for practice was greatly reduced.

Now, as long as his energy allowed, he could practice until midnight, and no one would say a word.

"Gurgle, gurgle..."

Only when his stomach growled did Li Xian stop his practice.

He carried the large pot to the courtyard and devoured the tiger soup.

A mouthful of milky white, thick soup went down his throat.

[Drank a large amount of tiger soup, practiced the art of consumption. Proficiency +6]

The blood and qi he had depleted from his martial arts practice were quickly replenished. His bones and flesh emitted a gentle warmth, an indescribable comfort.

Even a tiger beast couldn't withstand a slow boil over a fierce fire. It had become so tender the meat fell off the bone, and...

For this tiger soup, Li Xian had added a handful of salt!

It was very flavorful!

"Now, on top of being full, I can also pursue the pleasure of a good taste."

"Tomorrow's tiger soup, I'll add some wild vegetables for a mix of meat and vegetables, for balanced nutrition."

Li Xian patted his belly, feeling comfortable all over.

Even the highest-grade meals weren't as precious as this tiger soup.

"Hmm!"

Suddenly, in an instant.

Li Xian's breathing hitched. He felt an inner energy (qi) spreading throughout his body, and the flow of his blood became vividly perceptible, as if, in a flash, it had slowed down.

This was...

Solidifying the Blood
