## Chapter 70: Precipitous Terrain

The main peak of the Seven Mystic Gates loomed in the distance, its mountain body a lush green, surrounded by other mountains. The entrance to the mountain was rugged and treacherous, exuding a majestic aura that made one feel like a single man could block the pass and ten thousand men could not force their way through. 

Li Zhiming wasn't a stranger to this place; however, the journey here was long, and he only occasionally visited. As he rode his horse, he noticed numerous martial artists with bound legs and robust physiques, their bodies emitting a rich, fiery energy. Along the way, he saw ox carts and horse carriages, and some martial artists carried water cylinders several times their own size, their movements swift and agile, with not a single drop of water spilling from the cylinders.

Some men, massive and powerful like oxen, pulled several old yellow oxen backward with their bare hands, the oxen struggling but unable to resist the men's brute force. An elderly man, seemingly over eighty years old, with a robust spirit and silver hair, wore a long, black robe; his muscles were like forged iron, and he carried a heavy iron pole on his shoulder. 

The iron pole seemed to weigh a lot, but the old man walked steadily, his footsteps heavy, leaving deep impressions on the ground. As Li Zhiming and his companions approached the mountain gate, a young disciple of the Seven Mystic Gates stepped forward to greet them. 

The path to the mountain gate was not wide, just enough for one horse to pass, and was lined with lush greenery and moss. Some robust young martial artists from the Seven Mystic Gates stood to the side, yielding to Li Zhiming and his companions as they dismounted their horses.

The mountain path wound upward, with precipitous cliffs on both sides, making it difficult to climb. Even people with exceptional agility would find it hard to scale. The cliffs had been managed by the Seven Mystic Gates for centuries; wherever there was a slight outcropping of rock, it had been smoothed or sharpened.

The mountain was the foundation of the Seven Mystic Gates for several hundred years, and even the imperial court coveted this stronghold. The various halls, ancestral shrines, and the Treasury of Arts were all located on this mountain. There were multiple paths to the mountain, about six major and minor routes, all complex and circuitous like the one Li Zhiming was on.

It took only three li of mountain path for the first "checkpoint" to appear - an old wooden bridge suspended in mid-air, tied together with ropes and wooden planks. The bridge spanned a seemingly bottomless chasm, and one had to cross it to proceed. 

The bridge's strategic importance lay in its ability to be severed by a single sword cut if an emergency arose, blocking the path. Without the ability to fly, it was nearly impossible to breach the mountain. Li Zhiming knew that there were four more such bridges ahead.

The mountain had a vast area behind it, with wells, spring water, and large areas suitable for cultivation, capable of supporting a thousand people. A disciple guarding the bridge greeted Deng Xiangzhu and Li Zhiming, requesting that they hand over their horses.

It was a standard procedure; once on the mountain, one could no longer ride a horse. This wasn't solely due to the steep terrain but also a precaution against external threats. There had been an incident where a respected leader had fallen to his death from a horse on the bridge.

Deng Xiangzhu handed over the reins, and Li Zhiming nodded slightly in acknowledgement. The disciple, whose name was Tang, was surprised that Li Zhiming remembered him. Li Zhiming had saved Tang's life in the medicinal valley, and Tang had been grateful.

As they continued on foot, Li Zhiming glanced at Tang's black destiny pole. He could recall everyone's name and details because he had copied their destiny poles. 

The wooden bridge was just the beginning; they had to cross four more before reaching the top. The final ascent was to a mountain peak where a magnificent, tiled hall stood. The grounds were filled with young men and women about Li Zhiming's age, all with their hair tied up, practicing martial arts.

The leader of the group, Deng Xiangzhu, mentioned that the headmaster had specifically requested Li Zhiming's presence and would perform the ritual of tying the hair into a bun himself, a great honor. This was unprecedented in nearly eighty years.

Li Zhiming nodded slightly, feeling a sense of respect and responsibility. The young men and women looked at him with curiosity and admiration.
