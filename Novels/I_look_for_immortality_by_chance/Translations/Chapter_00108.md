# Chapter 108: Three Foundations, Fulfilling Promises

Gu Yuan had long pondered how he, as someone solely cultivating the Dao Academy's "Seed of Heaven and Earth Evergreen Diagram," could stand out among the numerous Golden Core families and compete for the position of a true disciple.  

The "Seed of Heaven and Earth Evergreen Diagram" was one of the secret transmissions of the Dao Academy, capable of leading directly to the Golden Core realm, and was by no means inferior.  

However, in terms of profound mysteries, it still fell short compared to the other true diagrams that only the Seven Great Veins and Golden Core families could cultivate.  

Once one reached Foundation Establishment, there would naturally be inherent gaps.  

The path to ascension ultimately remained in the hands of these elites. While those of humble backgrounds had avenues to progress, they were always at a slight disadvantage—unless they possessed extraordinary innate talent and could become disciples of a Golden Core master.  

But now, with the "Three Methods of Heaven and Man True Diagram," Gu Yuan felt he could finally rise above.  

"Among the Three Methods of Heaven and Man, in addition to the 'Seed of Heaven and Earth Evergreen Diagram' I currently cultivate, there are also the 'Diagram of the Vast Sea and Azure Abyss' and the 'Diagram of the Great Sun Golden Dragon Sword.' These three true diagrams, combined into one, have transformed into an entirely new method—cultivating three qi simultaneously, establishing three foundations, and obtaining three Dao Foundations. This is enough to compensate for any shortcomings of other true diagrams!"  

Feeling the surging and peculiar spiritual energy within him, Gu Yuan couldn't suppress the smile on his face for a long time.  

Most people only needed to refine one qi to establish a single Dao Foundation.  

Even with the profound heritage of Qingfeng Dao Academy, no one had ever managed to establish two Dao Foundations with a single true diagram.  

The academy possessed numerous profound methods, allowing practitioners to simultaneously cultivate various secret techniques and arts, mastering multiple methods with ever-changing techniques. However, once a Dao Foundation was established, it could not be altered.  

Each Dao Foundation represented a unique divine ability, one of the core strengths of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

But with the "Three Methods of Heaven and Man True Diagram," in addition to refining the "Green Wood Profound Spirit Qi" to establish the "Green Ginseng Dao Foundation," Gu Yuan could also refine the "Azure Sea Tide Life Qi" to establish the "Azure Abyss Dao Foundation."  

The Azure Abyss Dao Foundation naturally granted control over water. Moreover, it could condense "Profound Abyss Heavy Water," where a single drop weighed as much as ten thousand jun, making it nearly unstoppable when unleashed. If hundreds or thousands of drops were released together, they could reverse waterfalls and alter the course of rivers—though condensing such water was extremely difficult.  

Furthermore, he could refine the "Great Sun Golden Yi Qi," which, once refined, would allow him to establish the "Golden Rainbow Sword Foundation." This foundation could condense the Great Sun Golden Rainbow, making the cultivation of sword seals as effortless as a fish in water. The sword radiance would shine as brilliantly as the sun and move as swiftly as a rainbow.  

Three Dao Foundations!  

This method encompassed both cultivation and combat prowess, truly a divine and marvelous technique!  

With this method mastered, fighting one against three was not impossible.  

To stand out among the great families and various prodigies, such a marvelous method was indispensable!  

"Fortunately, I previously obtained the Three Hearts Golden Seal, which greatly enhanced my comprehension. Otherwise, I might not have been able to grasp the 'Three Methods of Heaven and Man True Diagram.' Moreover, this opportunity to receive the method was a one-time affair..."  

Looking at the empty space before him, Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh.  

Methods were not lightly transmitted—this was the final legacy of the master of the Silver-Skinned Beast Scripture. If he had failed to comprehend it, the method would have been lost forever.  

But fortunately, he had seized this opportunity.  

"With this method, I’ve finally eliminated a hidden obstacle and have hope of excelling in Foundation Establishment. However, the difficulty of cultivating this method is truly immense..."  

Feeling the thick and continuous spiritual energy within him, Gu Yuan's lips curled into a bitter smile.  

Three Dao Foundations meant a threefold increase in spiritual energy, but it also meant the difficulty of cultivation had tripled.  

Whether it was accumulating spiritual energy daily or breaking through bottlenecks, the challenges were three times greater than those faced by ordinary cultivators, requiring an incalculable amount of resources.  

This was the price one had to pay to surpass the ordinary.  

"Other resources can be sought gradually. For now, the most urgent matter is Foundation Establishment..."  

"To break through to Foundation Establishment, I must find and refine the wood, water, and metal qi simultaneously. Only then can I overcome the bottleneck and successfully establish my foundation."  

"These three qi must be refined together—none can be omitted. The difficulty is quite substantial."  

Gu Yuan pondered silently.  

Three entirely different types of heavenly and earthly qi were not so easily found.  

But at this moment, it seemed there was a perfect opportunity.  

"The Flowing Clouds Banquet..."  

"It seems this banquet is destined to be my opportunity."  

According to Bian Chuyao, the upcoming Flowing Clouds Banquet had released an additional twenty strands of heavenly and earthly qi for the new Foundation Establishment cultivators to compete over, allowing them to build their factions.  

But for Gu Yuan...  

"A faction? Gu doesn’t need a faction!"  

"I am my own faction!"  

Gu Yuan chuckled inwardly, making up his mind.  

However, this matter would take some time. In the meantime, it was best to prepare on multiple fronts.  

He took a deep breath, then bathed and purified himself, washing away the fatigue of the past few days. After dressing neatly, he mounted his flying shuttle and headed for Moon Bamboo Market.  

......  

"Guest, you’re seeking wood-type heavenly and earthly qi for Foundation Establishment?"  

At Moon Bamboo Market, the manager of South Mountain Pavilion frowned upon hearing Gu Yuan's request.  

"Such qi can only be gathered by cultivators at the ninth level of Qi Refinement or above who have comprehended the methods of Foundation Establishment. Generally, those who can gather such qi reserve it for their own use to advance to Foundation Establishment as soon as possible. It rarely circulates in the outside world..."  

"Not just our South Mountain Pavilion—even the entire Moon Bamboo Market might not see such qi sold once in several years."  

"This is the most critical resource for breaking through to Foundation Establishment. It’s priceless and scarcely available!"  

The manager of South Mountain Pavilion shook his head helplessly.  

Hearing this, Gu Yuan could only sigh in disappointment.  

While spirit stones were valuable, some cultivation resources simply couldn’t be bought with money.  

"However, our South Mountain Pavilion has a few maps marking secret lands where wood-type qi is exceptionally abundant. In these lands, qi may naturally form. If the guest is willing, you can gather it yourself. As long as you’re undisturbed, it should take about half a year to collect enough."  

The manager suddenly smiled slyly and produced a jade slip.  

"Guest, for just four hundred spirit stones, you can obtain three maps to secret lands. Would you consider it?"  

These secret lands had likely been exploited by countless people already. Gathering sufficient qi from them would be as difficult as ascending to heaven.  

Gu Yuan shook his head, though this deepened his understanding of how precious heavenly and earthly qi truly was.  

"Do you have any Earth Demon spiritual items?"  

Gu Yuan asked next.  

He had promised the Golden-Back Ape tribe to help them find Earth Demon spiritual items. Years had passed without success. Previously, his strength had been insufficient, so he hadn’t pushed the matter. But now that his power had greatly increased, there was no reason to delay further.  

"Earth Demon spiritual items?"  

The manager of South Mountain Pavilion pondered for a moment before finally producing another jade slip.  

"Not long ago, a place called 'Frost Ceremony Island' gave birth to a 'Heavenly Blood Pulp Fruit.' This item can assist high-grade demonic beasts in breaking through to the Earth Demon realm. However, several cultivators at the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refinement have already set their sights on it and are currently in a standoff."  

"By my estimate, the fruit will mature in about half a day. If the guest is confident in your strength, you could go and compete for it—or at least observe the battle and see if you can purchase it afterward."  

Gu Yuan took the jade slip, paid one hundred and fifty spirit stones, then mounted his jade shuttle and flew toward Frost Ceremony Island.  

A day later, Gu Yuan arrived at Spirit Crane Island with two bulging storage pouches and a blood-red jade box.  

Over the following days, he repeatedly traveled between Moon Bamboo Market and other locations, purchasing information in hopes of finding suitable secret lands and clues to heavenly and earthly qi. But his gains were minimal.  

As time passed, news of the Flowing Clouds Banquet’s reopening was officially announced within the Dao Academy.  

All ninth-level Qi Refinement cultivators in the academy were stirred.  

Numerous cultivators who had been struggling to find heavenly and earthly qi outside the academy returned one after another.  

For a time, streaks of light darted across the sky, heralding a brewing storm.  

At this moment, outside the entrance to Qian Yuan Cave...  

A young woman with skin as fair as snow, breathtaking beauty, and a perpetual gentle smile knocked on the cave’s door, holding a long list of gifts.  

"Senior Brother Gu, the Flowing Clouds Banquet is about to begin. Would you care to join me?"
