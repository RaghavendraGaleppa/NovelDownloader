## Chapter 58: Nothing More Than This

The elder who had undergone three stages of rebirth fell dead, his upper body twitching slightly for several breaths after hitting the ground.

Night had fallen, and cold snowflakes drifted down. Even the bright fire springs illuminating the area could not dispel the gloom in the hearts of the Golden Rooster Ridge inhabitants. The man and his steed felt to them no less overwhelming than countless powerful iron cavalry charging simultaneously; the pressure they exerted was immense. That was a veteran expert of three rebirth stages from their stronghold, yet the man riding the Purple Lightning Beast had cleaved him in two with a single saber strike. The two severed halves of the corpse seemed to crash into their very souls, the crimson blood not only staining the snowy ground but also chilling them to the bone.

The two Grand Bandits had cold eyes. Though heavy-hearted, they showed no fear of battle. Years of ruthless killing and baptism by fire had forged them, and this alone could not shake them. The main reason was that this man rode a Purple Lightning Beast; this creature's speed surpassed even that of a human who had undergone five stages of rebirth. They simply couldn't outrun him. If the two of them tried to flee separately, they would certainly be picked off one by one. Given the formidable display of the person before them, breaking into Golden Rooster Ridge alone at night, it was clear he intended to eliminate everyone.

Qin Ming rode the Purple Lightning Beast forward, its heavy, powerful hooves falling unhurriedly on the ground, like dull drumbeats that resonated, striking fear into hearts. Many of the bandits were terrified. Though they were usually bloodthirsty and ferocious, at this moment, they wished only to flee. The powerful hoofbeats seemed to stomp on their increasingly fragile minds. Qin Ming clutched the long spear in his right hand, pointing it forward. With a flick of the long saber in his left hand, crimson blood beads splattered onto the ground, and then he raised the blade.

“What are you waiting for? Surround him together!” one Grand Bandit roared, his cold words making many feel as if they had fallen into an ice cellar. This was a warning: no fleeing, they had to fight. They knew too well the methods of this faction; even if the two Grand Bandits were defeated, the Golden Bandits above would mercilessly deal with those who showed cowardice today.

At this moment, one Grand Bandit swung a broadsword wider than a palm, slashing towards the man and his steed, as if a bolt of lightning had struck. The heavy and powerful great spear in the other Grand Bandit’s hand had a blade that shimmered blindingly under the fire springs’ glow. He lunged forward, like a streak of rainbow light piercing through, stirring up a furious wind and swirling the snow on the ground. Previously, the two Grand Bandits had observed Qin Ming’s techniques and believed him to be a fourth-stage rebirth cultivator as well. They thought they could fight him; it was still uncertain who would prevail.

Qin Ming was fearless. He flicked his long spear in his right hand, scattering the swirling wind and snow, parrying the sharp spear blade aside, and then thrust it towards the man’s heart. Simultaneously, the long saber in his left hand chopped out, clashing with the greatsword in the other man’s hand, sending sparks flying. He spurred his beast forward. Wielding saber in his left hand and spear in his right, Qin Ming utilized the Purple Lightning Beast’s astonishing speed to generate terrifying momentum, single-handedly forcing the two Grand Bandits to stagger back. The faces of the other surrounding people changed. Those were their two leaders, yet even working together, they were forced back by a single opponent. The two Grand Bandits' blood and qi churned, and a chill ran down their spines, for the opponent’s strength was exceptionally great, a cut above their own.

Qin Ming, still riding the Purple Lightning Beast, did not stop. He charged towards the wooden huts behind the two, and at the same time, the urgent sound of chains rattling could be heard. With a thunderous boom, a terrifying explosion rang out. Someone was operating a specialized ballista; spear-like bolts were fired explosively. One of them Qin Ming dodged, stirring up a dreadful airflow as it whizzed past his ear, the immense power clearly discernible. Another bolt was struck by his saber, changing direction, piercing through a house and impaling a person standing in the snow, drawing a large gush of blood.

At the same time, Qin Ming cleaved through the wooden huts and other obstacles ahead with his long saber, breaking through. The gleaming saber light shredded all resistance. Two elders rushed out, each gripping a long spear, thrusting them at him. The two Grand Bandits from behind also swiftly closed in, joining the encirclement.

Qin Ming had long known that Golden Rooster Ridge had more than just one or two third-stage rebirth cultivators; he had personally witnessed four elders emerge alive from the great rift valley last time. He had already sensed that there were third-stage rebirth cultivators lying in wait here. He wanted to eliminate them first, lest they interfere during his confrontation with the two Grand Bandits. Most importantly, he feared these third-stage rebirth cultivators might secretly escape; they were much faster than the other mountain bandits. As for the two Grand Bandits, if they too tried to escape, they would naturally be his primary pursuit targets.

The two elderly bandits instantly felt as if struck by lightning. The opponent’s strength was too immense, simply unrivaled. Their arms twitched and trembled from the force of the impact. What was most terrifying was that the opponent’s great spear and long saber seemed to possess life and soul, cultivated to a realm they could barely fathom. Even as he slaughtered, all his movements carried an inexplicable divine charm, giving a visual sense of beauty; even killing seemed to become an art.

The long saber in Qin Ming’s hand continuously struck out, saber light following saber light, recreating the saber intent of 'Heaven and Sea Merging.' Layers upon layers of stacked saber light twisted away an elder’s long spear. With a light slash of the blade, blood seeped from his neck, and then he collapsed, his head falling to the ground. Another elder was buried under a deluge of spear shadows. His long spear was knocked away, and in an instant, the opponent’s long spear pierced his chest. He was then hoisted up, held aloft in mid-air. Qin Ming shook the great spear, and the dozens of spear shadows that should have appeared exploded within the elder’s body. The body of this elder, who had undergone three stages of rebirth, instantly exploded into pieces!

This sight sent a chill down the spines of both Grand Bandits. Seeing this, the other mountain bandits’ hair stood on end, and a chill ran from head to toe. Such a ferocious man and steed filled them with dread, making them want to flee immediately. Who cared if the Golden Robbers would settle accounts later? Staying alive was paramount right now. They realized that even their two leaders couldn’t stop this person.

Someone fled!

“Everyone, halt!” one Grand Bandit roared.

Qin Ming clashed intensely with the two Grand Bandits several times, then charged past them. Riding the Purple Lightning Beast, he pursued them onto the mountain path, continuously striking with his saber, cutting down six men, who all fell into pools of blood. Behind them, several more mountain bandits turned pale, their path ahead blocked. Qin Ming stood his ground, saber drawn, watching them indifferently. He then rode the Purple Lightning Beast back towards the stronghold.

“Who exactly are you? When did Golden Rooster Ridge ever offend you?” one Grand Bandit couldn’t help but ask. He still didn’t even know the opponent’s identity.

“If this stronghold is eradicated, the Golden Robbers won’t just stand by,” the other Grand Bandit said, his confidence clearly wavering.

“You bandits, after being offered amnesty, your roguish nature remained unchanged and even intensified, bringing calamity to this region. Do you think the City Lord would just stand by? Even the Transcendents are provoked by your actions. Your heinous crimes are too numerous to list; if Golden Rooster Ridge isn’t destroyed, even Heaven itself would be displeased!” Qin Ming said in a hoarse voice.

The two Grand Bandits were filled with apprehension and suspicion. A bad premonition arose in their hearts; the opponent mentioned the City Lord and then Transcendents—indeed, both could potentially act against them. A new official’s first acts are often drastic, and perhaps their fire would burn towards them. Furthermore, not long ago, they had even collaborated with a transcendent beast, only for it to inexplicably vanish.

Qin Ming spurred his beast into a charge, and the remaining mountain bandits scattered and fled.

“Why panic? To the back mountain!” one Grand Bandit shouted. Immediately, some people's eyes darted, and they ran towards the back mountain. Qin Ming, meanwhile, re-strung his bow and shot down several people in quick succession. The two Grand Bandits closed in, forcing him to draw his saber again and confront them.

This time, Qin Ming focused on his saber techniques. A hazy saber light flowed, and the phoenix-patterned long saber seemed imbued with life, carrying the sound of wind and thunder, accompanied by dazzling flashes of light, as if intending to sever the heavens at a single point. The two Grand Bandits’ hearts trembled. The opponent’s life-tier was similar to theirs, yet his saber mastery had reached a realm they could only gaze up at. Only because his Heavenly Light could not yet be unleashed externally along the blade was it not even more terrifying. They strongly suspected that, purely in terms of saber technique comprehension, this person might be no weaker than some of the Golden Robber chieftains.

Pfft! One man’s shoulder was struck by the saber, blood spurting out. Qin Ming was somewhat surprised. The instinctive intuition of a fourth-stage rebirth cultivator was indeed powerful. His saber strike had originally been intended to cleave the opponent's shoulder diagonally, killing him in one blow. As a result, the opponent had pre-empted it, only getting grazed on the shoulder without even damaging the bone.

This Grand Bandit became desperate, discarding his broadsword. With a 'bang,' he seized a fleeting opportunity with incredibly sharp spiritual perception, clamping Qin Ming’s passing saber between his hands. Although threads of Heavenly Light emanated from the Grand Bandit’s hands, protecting him, his palms were still injured, and crimson blood trickled down. With a 'crunch,' he broke the long saber in Qin Ming’s hand. So this is a fourth-stage rebirth cultivator? They are indeed much stronger than those elders; their total Heavenly Light has greatly increased. In a sense, they are even more dangerous when fighting bare-handed.

The other Grand Bandit launched a fierce assault, intending to suppress Qin Ming and prevent him from reaching for his long spear. Both of them realized that this mysterious person’s saber techniques and spear techniques had been cultivated to an unparalleled level, possessing the power to turn decay into wonder. If he continued to grow, he would truly transcend, his killing power soaring further amidst artistic beauty, his skill nearing the Dao.

Qin Ming was fearless. He also wanted to test his Heavenly Light energy. He threw the long saber, and with a 'pfft,' it pierced a mountain bandit in the distance. Then, he faced the enemy bare-handed. The two Grand Bandits’ attacks were swift and fierce, arriving from both sides consecutively. Qin Ming’s left hand met one Grand Bandit, colliding solidly with his palm, and their respective Heavenly Light energies burst forth instantly. In an instant, that Grand Bandit flew backward, clutching his palm, his face pale. His right hand was covered in blood, a large chunk of flesh torn away. Not only that, a terrifying penetrating force ravaged his palm; his right hand was a bloody mess, and three finger bones were broken.

Qin Ming leaped up, dismounting from the Purple Lightning Beast, and met the other Grand Bandit mid-air, who was pouncing like a hawk. The two clashed several times in the shortest span. This Grand Bandit fared even worse; his hands were completely deformed. He screamed, flung back six or seven meters. Both his hands were like chicken claws, unable to straighten, most of the flesh torn away, and all his finger bones broken.

“He has merged several types of Heavenly Light energy!”

“Why are you targeting us?” A bone-chilling coldness spread through both of them. To be able to merge several types of Heavenly Light energy at only the fourth stage of rebirth was certainly not something a small organization could cultivate; he must have a significant background. They did not know that Qin Ming was only a third-stage rebirth cultivator.

“Am I too strong, or did I overestimate you earlier? Fourth-stage rebirth Grand Bandits are nothing more than this,” Qin Ming said in a hoarse voice, lowering his head to look at his own hands. He had already sat back onto the Purple Lightning Beast’s back immediately. The beast, which had already stretched its legs and wanted to bolt, could only gnash its teeth in secret. In truth, it had the opportunity to try and bolt, but it was intimidated by Qin Ming’s imposing aura, fearing it would be killed like those bandits. Qin Ming patted its head and said, “Your choice was correct. See this long spear of mine? It’s prepared just for you. If you dare run, I’ll throw it with full force, guaranteed to nail you dead on the mountain path.”

The two Grand Bandits retreated, now completely losing the confidence and strength to fight Qin Ming head-on. They turned and left, using the buildings as cover, hoping to shake off their opponent as they rushed towards the back mountain. Qin Ming pursued them on the Purple Lightning Beast, and along the way, he had already stabbed one Grand Bandit to death with his long spear. With a forceful shake of the spear, the corpse exploded into pieces. Afterward, he saw what lay in the back mountain, murmuring to himself, “No wonder it’s called Golden Rooster Ridge.”

***

In the deep night, below Golden Rooster Ridge, a few figures stood quietly in the dense forest beside the road. A woman was contemplating something in the darkness.

“Miss, are you still waiting?” a maid beside her asked softly.

In the dim forest, the woman had a slender figure, her face indistinct. She said, “Hmm, let’s wait a little longer. That figure riding the Purple Lightning Beast looks familiar…”

“Like whom?”

“Cui Chonghe.”
