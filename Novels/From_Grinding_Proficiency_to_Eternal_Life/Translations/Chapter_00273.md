# Chapter 273: Afraid of Brothers Suffering

The scales of the dragon armor clanged loudly as they were struck, but he paid it no mind, grinning with the same rough smile familiar from the escape across the eight hundred miles of barren ice plains: "Damn it! I thought it was some old monster from the Dao Sect coming out of seclusion, so it's just you, bastard!"

His rough hand suddenly grabbed the back of Xu Yunfan's neck, lowering his voice: "Are you here to take me as your master?"

Before Xu Yunfan could speak, Fang Mushan patted his chest and said, "Don't worry, with your Big Brother Fang here, you're guaranteed to enter the Dao Sect today. That old man Bi was unfair back then, not taking you away. Now that you've crossed mountains and seas to come here, full of sincerity, even if your aptitude isn't great, the Dao Sect will accept you for such tenacious determination."

Xu Yunfan didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "I've already taken a master. I'm a disciple of the Skyforge Cave now."

He naturally knew Fang Mushan was being kind; upon meeting, he immediately assumed Xu Yunfan had come to seek their help. With the bond forged through life-and-death experiences, Fang Mushan would naturally do his best.

Back in the eight hundred miles of barren ice plains, Xu Yunfan had helped him many times, and he remembered it all.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have kept muttering to Bi Sheng about not bringing Xu Yunfan back.

Fang Mushan's tiger eyes widened upon hearing this. "What? The Skyforge Cave?"

He scratched his head and turned to look at Li Haomiao. "Old Li, what kind of sect is that? How does it compare to the Dao Sect?"

Li Haomiao was tilting his head back to drink. Hearing this, his wrist paused, and amber-colored wine dripped down his chin.

He wiped his mouth and glanced sideways at Xu Yunfan. "A second-rate sect specializing in forging weapons. The strongest in the sect, Hong Baichuan, is only at the Marrow Cleansing Realm. Previously, the Skyforge Cave moved the Skyforge City to become the Skyforge Fortress, which shocked the entire martial world for quite a while. This sect... isn't bad."

Meeting an old friend with whom he shared a life-and-death bond naturally lifted his spirits.

The Skyforge Fortress's relocation passed through two provinces, causing quite a stir. Many onlookers followed the entire way, and the Dao Sect naturally knew about it.

"Marow Cleansing Realm?!"

Fang Mushan's voice suddenly rose, shaking the raindrops off the pine branches.

He grabbed Xu Yunfan, looking heartbroken. "Brother, you've been糊涂 (mistaken)!"

His rough fingers poked at the dragon scales on Xu Yunfan's chest. "With your skills, you'd be more than qualified to be an inner disciple in the Dao Sect, yet you went to the Skyforge Cave to... what? You're a true disciple in the Skyforge Cave?!"

Fang Mushan's voice rose again, somewhat disbelieving. Although he was known as a true disciple, his cultivation speed was truly slow. Li Haomiao was almost touching the Muscle Refining Realm, while he had just entered the Outer Three Unifications. If not for his innate talent and divine strength, he probably wouldn't even rank on the Divine Thunder Peak.

Fang Mushan said, "Brother Xu, you've been糊涂 (mistaken)! Even as a true disciple, it's not as good as being an inner disciple in the Dao Sect. That Skyforge Cave, as Brother Li just said, is a second-rate sect, and it's purely about blacksmithing... you'll delay your martial arts training!"

As he spoke, Fang Mushan paused slightly, staring intently at the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel behind Xu Yunfan and the dragon armor on his body, looking somewhat hesitant.

"Brother Xu, this armor of yours is..."

"Dragon Scale Armor, a Divine Weapon. My master specially gave it to me!"

"What?!"

This time, Fang Mushan's expression completely changed. He truly didn't expect the Skyforge Cave to be so generous as to give away a Divine Weapon as a gift.

Although Li Haomiao and he had joined the Dao Sect, they still didn't have a decent weapon. The Coiling Dragon Spear behind him was something he personally spent a great deal of money to buy from the Dao Sect's Weapon Forging Hall.

After a moment of silence, Fang Mushan switched to earnest persuasion: "Brother Xu, the Skyforge Cave's resources definitely aren't great. You'll be held back in your martial arts training. Even though you've taken a master, where will you get martial arts resources?"

Xu Yunfan said, "Oh, because I'm currently the number one true disciple of the Skyforge Cave, all the sect's resources are being poured into me. I don't have to worry about insufficient resources. As for precious pills and elixirs, since the Skyforge Cave's Forging Hall exports many weapons, many sects seeking precious artifacts and sharp blades are very willing to exchange them for valuable medicinal pills."

"Plus, now I can forge sharp blade-level weapons..."

"What?!"

This time, Fang Mushan couldn't hold back anymore, shaking Xu Yunfan's hands continuously.

"You're saying you can forge sharp blade-level weapons?!"

Xu Yunfan was shaken until his head spun, smiling wryly: "Brother Fang, I..."

Li Haomiao said softly from the side: "Brother Fang, it seems Brother Xu's life is much better than yours. Sometimes, it's better to be the head of a chicken than the tail of a phoenix..."

Realizing he had lost his composure, Fang Mushan's old face turned red. He coughed dryly and directly interrupted Li Haomiao, counting on his fingers as he lectured Xu Yunfan.

"Do you know how many supreme techniques are in the Dao Sect's Scripture Pavilion? Have you heard of the 'Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock'? Cultivating it to completion allows you to enter the Nine Realms directly, ride the wind, and cross the Weak Water! And the 'Supreme Azure Cloud Sword Canon'—one sword strike makes a hundred ghosts weep!"

As he spoke, he grew more excited, then suddenly lowered his voice and leaned in: "If all else fails, I'll split half of Brother Li's 'Dragon Sparrow Bone Tempering Technique' from the Yellow Island Secret Canon with you! No matter how good the Skyforge Cave is, its martial arts can't compare to the Dao Sect's depth, right?"

Seeming to regain his confidence, Fang Mushan patted his chest: "With my face, that old man Bi will definitely agree to let you in."

Li Haomiao spat out a mouthful of wine: "Fang! Mu! Shan!"

Xu Yunfan struggled to hold back his laughter, his shoulder armor trembling.

Fang Mushan thought he was wavering and pressed his advantage, pulling out a greasy token from his怀里: "See this? The Dao Sect Token bestowed by the Dao Sect Elder! I earned it by helping them kill a Chaos Hound beast during the Primordial Spirit's resurgence last year."

He slapped the token into Xu Yunfan's palm. "Today, I'll use this token to guarantee your entry. If old man Bi dares to stop you..."

Xu Yunfan felt a slight warmth in his heart. Although Fang Mushan was rough, this Dao Token—if he encountered someone in need outside—would easily fetch tens of thousands of taels of silver, with people fighting red-faced over it. Just casually throwing it out was enough to show his loyalty.

"Brother Fang..."

Xu Yunfan finally found a chance to speak. His fingertip lightly flicked, and the token flipped back into Fang Mushan's怀里. "I've already received my master's true transmission of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique..."

As he spoke, he suddenly formed a sword with his fingers. A wisp of green light shot out from his fingertips, carving a sword mark three inches deep into the snow—exactly the thick, wave-like Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength.

Fang Mushan's gaping mouth could fit in a goose egg.

Li Haomiao's pupils contracted sharply, and the wine jar cracked with a *snap*: "Strength?!"

He looked up, dazed, at Xu Yunfan before him, speaking word by word.

"Muscle Refining Realm?!"

"Not Muscle Refining Realm," Xu Yunfan replied lightly.

Fang Mushan's expression relaxed slightly, laughing: "I knew it! Yunfan's aptitude is even worse than mine. I'm still wandering around the Outer Three Unifications; how could he have entered the Muscle Refining Realm? It must be a trump card his master gave him, able to unleash a sudden burst of strength..."

Xu Yunfan said softly: "I'm already at the Marrow Cleansing Realm."
