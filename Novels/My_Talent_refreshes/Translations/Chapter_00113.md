# Chapter 113: Qi Condensation Eighth Layer

It was another closed market day. In his backyard, Chu Ning held a Golden Orchid Fruit. Before him stood Little White, along with several Grey Spirit Rabbits.

"Little White, what do you think of this spirit fruit?" Chu Ning asked, holding up the Golden Orchid Fruit towards Little White.

"Ying!" Little White whimpered. "Want to eat!"

"This is a mutated spirit fruit, you can't just eat it casually, you little glutton," Chu Ning playfully scolded. However, from Little White's divine sense transmission, Chu Ning generally understood that the Golden Orchid Fruit had a high spiritual energy content.

But given that it was a mutated spirit fruit, for the sake of caution, and to thoroughly understand its medicinal effects, Chu Ning decided it was best to conduct some experiments. Thus, he specifically prepared several Grey Spirit Rabbits.

Picking up a Golden Orchid Fruit, Chu Ning squeezed it firmly. This Golden Orchid Fruit was even harder than the Iron Orchid Fruit. Chu Ning had to apply more force to break it open. To his surprise, after it was cracked, there was no direct flow of juice. Instead, it contained white flesh, which appeared incredibly juicy.

Chu Ning took out a jade knife, sliced off a small piece of the flesh, and fed it to one of the Grey Spirit Rabbits. Then, he cut off a larger piece of flesh. With a gentle squeeze, a drop of viscous juice oozed from the flesh and fell into a small bowl. Immediately, the clear water in the bowl turned milky white.

Chu Ning picked up a Grey Spirit Rabbit from in front of him and directly fed it a mouthful of the diluted juice. Then, he switched to another Grey Spirit Rabbit. This time, he didn't feed it directly but smeared the milky white diluted juice onto its body.

Having done all this, Chu Ning looked at the remaining half of the Golden Orchid Fruit. Because of the continuous slicing, the fruit's core was exposed. The core was yellowish-brown, with individual kernels about the size of rice grains. Chu Ning carefully removed each kernel, planning to prepare them as seeds according to the sect's spiritual plant cultivation methods. Of course, this was only if the Golden Orchid Fruit proved genuinely useful and had no adverse effects.

Worried that the Grey Spirit Rabbit experiment might not be entirely accurate, Chu Ning pondered for a moment and bought several Spirit Chickens from Lu Miaoying next door. He then repeated the previous steps, feeding some fruit flesh, some fruit juice, and topically applying the diluted juice to others. Afterward, Chu Ning kept these Grey Spirit Rabbits and Spirit Chickens in separate areas of his backyard.

After a short period, Chu Ning went to observe them. To his delight, none of the Grey Spirit Rabbits or Spirit Chickens showed any signs of discomfort. On the contrary, they were all energetic. Chu Ning didn't rush to conclusions. After observing for a full day, he began carefully examining each one with his divine sense.

He discovered that regardless of whether they were Grey Spirit Rabbits or Spirit Chickens, the spiritual energy fluctuations within them were stronger than the day before. Among them, the increase in spiritual energy was more pronounced in those that had eaten the fruit flesh compared to the others.

"So these Golden Orchid Fruits are meant to be eaten directly? And there's no body-tempering effect anymore?" Chu Ning was somewhat doubtful. He wasn't satisfied with this result, as he had grown the Iron Stalk Orchids specifically for body tempering. If the hybridized Golden Orchid Fruit lacked body-tempering effects, this mutation would be useless to him.

At this thought, Chu Ning's heart stirred. He hurried over to Lu Miaoying's shop and bought another Spirit Chicken and Grey Spirit Rabbit. Chu Ning's frequent purchases of Spirit Chickens and Rabbits somewhat surprised Lu Miaoying, who couldn't understand why Chu Ning had suddenly become so enthusiastic about supplementation. Chu Ning, however, paid no mind to her curious gaze, grasping the animals and returning directly to his shop's backyard.

Immediately, Chu Ning examined the newly bought Spirit Chicken with his divine sense, then separately examined the other animals he had experimented on. A flicker of unusual light passed through his eyes. The next moment, he picked up the newly purchased Spirit Chicken again.

"Crack!" With a mournful cry from the chicken, he broke one of its wings. When Chu Ning picked up the chicken that had been smeared with diluted fruit juice, using the same force, he couldn't break its wing. Chu Ning applied a little more force, and the Spirit Chicken cried out mournfully. "Crack." Its wing finally broke. Ignoring the Spirit Chicken's cries, he picked up the Spirit Chicken that had eaten the fruit juice. As he expected, he had to apply even more force to break its wing. As for the Spirit Chicken that had eaten the fruit flesh directly, Chu Ning had to use about twice the initial force to break its wing.

This scene undoubtedly made Little White, who was lying on the ground nearby, tremble in fear. It quickly scurried away from Chu Ning, seemingly afraid that Chu Ning might set his sights on it. Fortunately, Chu Ning didn't turn his attention to Little White. Instead, he continued with the Grey Spirit Rabbits, beginning to break their legs. The entire backyard was a scene of carnage.

After all the experiments were complete, Chu Ning took out a Rejuvenation Talisman and cast it, healing all the Grey Spirit Rabbits and Spirit Chickens.

He then took out another Golden Orchid Fruit and fed it to them again, just as he had the day before. At this point, Chu Ning had made a preliminary judgment. This Golden Orchid Fruit could both increase the spiritual energy of these Spirit Chickens and Grey Spirit Rabbits, and temper their bodies. Among the methods, topical application, like with the Iron Orchid Fruit, was the least effective. Drinking the juice was next. The most effective method was eating the fruit flesh directly.

If this deduction held, a cultivator consuming the Golden Orchid Fruit directly could very likely both increase their magic power and temper their body. Despite having this judgment, Chu Ning decided to feed them for three days and observe for several more days to be absolutely sure.

For the next two days, Chu Ning chose relatively fixed times each day to check on the effects of the Golden Orchid Fruit on the Grey Spirit Rabbits and Spirit Chickens in the backyard. In three days, the Grey Spirit Rabbits and Spirit Chickens visibly grew larger each day. Although Chu Ning only fed them for three days, the effect continued even after stopping. After another seven days, for a total of ten days, the Grey Spirit Rabbits and Spirit Chickens stopped growing. However, they were still about a circle larger than when Chu Ning first bought them, and showed no signs of discomfort.

Chu Ning also tested the bone strength of the Grey Spirit Rabbits and Spirit Chickens, finding them several times stronger than the two newly purchased ones. Furthermore, Chu Ning didn't waste the new Spirit Chickens and Grey Spirit Rabbits; he fed them some fruit kernels. After all, if Chu Ning ate the Golden Orchid Fruit directly, he might consume the kernels along with it. He ultimately found that the Spirit Chickens and Grey Spirit Rabbits that ate the kernels showed no abnormalities, though there seemed to be no effect on increasing spiritual energy.

Only then did Chu Ning truly feel relieved. He decided to use the Golden Orchid Fruit for his own body tempering. Before cultivating, Chu Ning checked his current progress.

【Azurewood Everspring Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Layer (540/2100)】
【Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Unbreaking Sinews (333/1500)】
【Soul Refinement Art, First Layer (802/1000)】

During these ten days, Chu Ning had naturally not stopped cultivating. After he began using Spirit Essence Pills, combined with daily cultivation, his Azurewood Everspring Art's proficiency had returned to a daily increase of about 4 points. The Unbreaking Sinews proficiency, with the Iron Orchid Fruit for body tempering combined with daily cultivation, also steadily increased by 2 points per day. As for the Soul Refinement Art, when he was at his peak in talisman crafting, Chu Ning once achieved a daily increase of 4 points when his Qi Condensation and body tempering intensity were not as high.

However, now Chu Ning could achieve over 2 points daily, roughly 5 points of proficiency increase every two days. He tossed a Golden Orchid Fruit to Little White, who happily munched on it with satisfying crunching sounds. Chu Ning himself took out a Golden Orchid Fruit, vigorously squeezed its skin open, and put the entire fruit into his mouth.

With one Golden Orchid Fruit down, Chu Ning immediately felt a wave of heat in his abdomen. Should he temper his body first, or cultivate qi first? Thinking that the Golden Orchid Fruit might be effective for both, this thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind. Feeling the heat spread through his limbs and bones, and sensing that the warmth leaned more towards body tempering, Chu Ning ultimately chose to temper his body first.

He immediately began cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art. After cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art over and over again, Chu Ning finally dissipated the burning sensation that had spread throughout his body. However, a faint warmth lingered in his abdomen, a sign of spiritual energy gathering. Chu Ning, at this moment, couldn't bother to check the progress of the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art and immediately sat cross-legged, cultivating the Azurewood Everspring Art.

His magic power circulated continuously within his body until all the spiritual energy from the Golden Orchid Fruit was transformed into magic power. Only then did Chu Ning truly stop. At this point, Chu Ning finally looked at his cultivation progress in his mind.

【Azurewood Everspring Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Layer (541/2100)】
【Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Unbreaking Sinews (335/1500)】
【Soul Refinement Art, First Layer (802/1000)】

"Azurewood Everspring Art increased by 1 proficiency point, and Unbreaking Sinews proficiency increased by 2 points!" Chu Ning delightedly observed the improvements the Golden Orchid Fruit brought him. Consuming one Golden Orchid Fruit had actually achieved both Qi Condensation and body tempering effects simultaneously. Moreover, the effects were quite significant. If he used one Golden Orchid Fruit every day, combined with Spirit Essence Pills and daily cultivation, his Azurewood Everspring Art could increase by 5 points and Unbreaking Sinews by 3 points per day.

"This truly is an unexpected bonus!" Chu Ning chuckled as he ended his cultivation. His storage bag didn't contain many Golden Orchid Fruits at the moment, only about 60. But for him, cultivating more Golden Orchid Fruits naturally wouldn't be difficult.

Chu Ning immediately went to the backyard, took out the kernels he had previously extracted from the Golden Orchid Fruit flesh, and began to accelerate their growth. He instantly cast the Growth Acceleration Spell, hitting the Golden Orchid Fruit seeds. The seeds showed no reaction, which didn't surprise Chu Ning. After all, given the excellent effects of the Golden Orchid Fruit, it was normal for its cultivation to be more difficult. It wasn't the first time he'd encountered seeds that were hard to sprout.

He then cast consecutive Growth Acceleration Spells, one after another, onto the Golden Orchid Fruit seeds. In the blink of an eye, Chu Ning had cast nearly 20 Growth Acceleration Spells. Yet, the seeds still showed no reaction. Chu Ning instinctively sensed them with his divine sense, and his brow furrowed slightly. Previously, with other seeds that required many Growth Acceleration Spells, there would be some subtle changes as the spells progressed. Even if the changes were minute, they could be sensed with careful divine sense examination. But now, after consecutively using 20 Growth Acceleration Spells, Chu Ning didn't feel any change in these seeds.

"Could it be that these seeds simply cannot be accelerated?" A sense of unease flashed through Chu Ning's mind. However, he didn't stop because of this. Instead, he continued to cast Growth Acceleration Spells. Soon after, another 30 Growth Acceleration Spells were cast onto the seeds. Simultaneously, Chu Ning continued his divine sense examination.

Then Chu Ning stopped casting, shaking his head with a slight sigh. It seemed his earlier worries had come true. With 50 consecutive Growth Acceleration Spells yielding no reaction, there was only one possibility: these Golden Orchid Fruit seeds could not be forced to grow.

"Mutated ones are always mutated, prone to problems," Chu Ning sighed inwardly. He had originally thought that if the Golden Orchid Fruit seeds could be cultivated, he would uproot all the Golden Origin Fruits and Iron Stalk Orchids in his spirit field and plant these Golden Orchid Fruits instead. But now, it seemed this idea was a bust. To obtain Golden Orchid Fruits, he could only rely on the previous accidental method: ensuring the two spiritual plants flowered at the same time and allowing the Iron Stalk Orchid pollen to fertilize. This was certainly not as convenient, but it was an unavoidable measure.

The next day, Chu Ning arrived at his spirit field. Coincidentally, the normally growing Iron Orchid Fruits had matured. Chu Ning first harvested all these Iron Orchid Fruits. The yield of these Iron Orchid Fruits was considerably higher than what Chu Ning had grown in his courtyard before. He had initially purchased 100 seeds from Cloudsea Pavilion. Excluding the 20 mutated, hybridized plants, the remaining 80 Iron Stalk Orchids yielded a total of 270 Iron Orchid Fruits.

After harvesting the Iron Orchid Fruits, Chu Ning began the transplanting process. He first moved some of the Golden Origin Fruits in the central areas, scattering and planting the 80 Iron Stalk Orchids among them. Then, Chu Ning replanted the moved Golden Origin Fruits in an interleaved pattern. This way, the 100 Iron Stalk Orchids were completely surrounded by Golden Origin Fruits, increasing the probability of pollination. Chu Ning also planned to dig up a few more Golden Origin Fruits, cultivate some seeds from the recently obtained Iron Orchid Fruits, and plant a few more rows of Iron Orchid Fruits. If he could plant another 100 plants, he would be able to cultivate 200 Golden Orchid Fruit trees in the future. This would be enough for half a year or even a year of his cultivation from a single harvest.

Of course, that was for later. For now, Chu Ning's priority was to cultivate this batch well. After transplanting these two spiritual plants, Chu Ning began casting the Sweet Rain Spell and the Azurewood Spring Bloom Spell. He needed to accelerate the next fruiting cycle of these Iron Stalk Orchids and Golden Origin Fruits.

However, Chu Ning's choice of acceleration was now more deliberate. He no longer used the Azurewood Spring Bloom Spell in wide swaths as before but meticulously controlled its casting range. He only allowed the Azurewood Spring Bloom Spell to fall on the Iron Stalk Orchids, ensuring it didn't affect the Golden Origin Fruits. After all, Iron Stalk Orchids had a longer flowering period. If he were to accelerate the Golden Origin Fruits now, it was very possible that the Golden Origin Fruits' flowers would wither before the Iron Stalk Orchids' even bloomed.

In the blink of an eye, ten days passed. Three days prior, Chu Ning had prepared the Iron Orchid Fruit seeds. These seeds, unlike the Golden Orchid Fruit seeds, could be planted. Chu Ning successfully germinated them and planted them in his spirit field. For this, Chu Ning specially dug up 100 Golden Origin Fruit trees. He didn't waste these trees but transplanted them all to the backyard of his spiritual plant house. After all, these spiritual plants could still be used to offset the monthly rent of the Azure Creek Spiritual Plant Shop.

At this time, the 200 Iron Stalk Orchids in Chu Ning's field were divided into three types. One type was the 20 plants that had already produced Golden Orchid Fruits. Because these trees were harvested early, under continuous spellcasting, Chu Ning felt that their next flowering and fruiting wouldn't be too far off. Therefore, Chu Ning had already begun casting spells on the surrounding rows of Golden Origin Fruits, trying to make both spiritual plants flower simultaneously.

Another 80 plants were ordinary Iron Stalk Orchids that had only undergone 10 days of Azurewood Spring Bloom Spell acceleration, meaning they still had some time before flowering and fruiting. Finally, there were the 100 newly planted saplings, which naturally had a much longer way to go. Chu Ning applied spells separately to each category, which was much more meticulous than his previous work. Therefore, during these past ten days or so, besides his daily talisman crafting and cultivation, Chu Ning spent most of his time in the spirit field.

However, one morning, after his regular cultivation and breakfast, Chu Ning did not choose to go to the spirit field. Instead, he directly closed his shop door, went to the backyard, and prepared to cultivate the Azurewood Everspring Art.

【Azurewood Everspring Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Layer (596/2100)】
【Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Unbreaking Sinews (368/1500)】
【Soul Refinement Art, First Layer (824/1000)】

After eleven days of cultivation, Chu Ning's Azurewood Everspring Art's proficiency on the third layer had reached 596. He was only 4 proficiency points away from reaching 600 and breaking through to the Qi Condensation Eighth Layer from the seventh. Chu Ning decided to just push directly to the Qi Condensation Eighth Layer.

Without taking a Spirit Essence Pill, Chu Ning took out a pile of spirit stones. In his previous breakthroughs, Chu Ning had relied on spirit stones rather than pills. This time, Chu Ning decided to do the same. He leaped into the circular ring formed by the Iron Stalk Orchids in the backyard, first casting an Azurewood Spring Bloom Spell. Immediately afterward, Chu Ning sat cross-legged and began cultivating with the spirit stones.

Chu Ning's speed in absorbing spiritual energy from spirit stones was not slow. However, upon entering the Qi Condensation Seventh Layer, Chu Ning needed 6 spirit stones for every point of proficiency increase, which was double that of the Qi Condensation Sixth Layer. So, even with the help of spirit stones, Chu Ning still needed some time.

Half an hour later, the Azurewood Spring Bloom Spell on the Iron Stalk Orchids began to take effect. Strands of spiritual energy emanated and entered Chu Ning's body, and his cultivation speed became even faster. Spirit stones were consumed one after another. After consuming nearly 40 spirit stones, Chu Ning, who had been sitting cross-legged, finally straightened up.

【Azurewood Everspring Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Layer (601/2100)】
【Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Unbreaking Sinews (368/1500)】
【Soul Refinement Art, First Layer (824/1000)】

Qi Condensation Eighth Layer!

Feeling the state of his magic power in his dantian and checking his cultivation proficiency, Chu Ning's face broke into a smile. There was no great surprise, no bottleneck encountered. After reaching 600 proficiency with 24 spirit stones, Chu Ning used another 16 spirit stones to break through the Qi Condensation Seventh Layer in one go. At this moment, Chu Ning had officially reached the Qi Condensation Eighth Layer.
