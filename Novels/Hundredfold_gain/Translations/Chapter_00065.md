# Chapter 65: You Play the Tiger Against the Wolf, While I Watch from the Mountain! (Please Follow and Read)

Some time later, ninety li north of the Fengyue Sect, at the Mystic Ice River.

This was a forest blanketed in snow and frost. Towering trees bore thick layers of accumulated snow, their outward-reaching branches adorned with crystalline icicles. When the wind blew, the branches swayed, causing the ice crystals to collide and produce a continuous crackling sound.

Rustle.

Qi Chuan, clad in the attire of a Fengyue Sect inner disciple, walked across the snow-covered forest floor. Soon, the view ahead opened up, revealing a vast expanse of white, frozen lake.

No—this wasn't a lake but a frozen river. Beneath the mystic ice, water still flowed, though the river was so wide it resembled a lake.

"Is this the Mystic Ice River?" Qi Chuan murmured, a trace of awe flashing across his face. This wasn't originally a world of ice and snow, but due to the Mystic Ice spiritual vein beneath the river, this localized frozen realm had emerged in an otherwise temperate region.

"Beneath this ice, there truly are ice-attribute demonic beasts." Qi Chuan lowered his gaze to the ice, as if peering through it to see the dark shadows of creatures lazily drifting in the frigid waters below.

Occasionally, the sounds of fierce battles between demonic beasts would rise through the water and ice, followed by bursts of blood mist as the victor, eyes glowing crimson, voraciously devoured the remains of the defeated.

"However, this section of the river only has a lower first-grade spiritual energy concentration. The Iceglass Dragon-Scale Carp is a mid first-grade ice-attribute demonic beast, so it would only reside in the deeper parts of the Mystic Ice River, where the mid first-grade spiritual vein lies."

Qi Chuan reached out and grasped at the air, summoning a faint wisp of spiritual energy that carried a trace of icy chill.

"The energy here is too sparse—this can't be the section with the mid first-grade spiritual vein. I need to go deeper."

With this thought, faint crystalline jade light flickered beneath his feet as he swiftly glided across the ice toward the heart of the Mystic Ice River.

Soon, Qi Chuan arrived at the deepest part of the river. Looking around, he could no longer discern the outlines of the snow-laden forests on either bank—only the endless white expanse of the frozen river remained.

"This must be the location of the mid first-grade Mystic Ice spiritual vein."

Standing firmly on the thick ice, Qi Chuan grasped another wisp of spiritual energy. This time, it was noticeably denser than before.

However, the area with such concentrated spiritual energy spanned only about three hundred zhang in width and a thousand zhang in length—not particularly large.

"Hmm? There seem to be signs of broken ice ahead?"

Qi Chuan's gaze sharpened as he noticed anomalies in the ice several dozen zhang away. The surface appeared to have been broken and then refrozen, as if someone had entered the water beneath.

"Has someone been here already?"

Frowning slightly, Qi Chuan considered the possibility. The mission to hunt the Iceglass Dragon-Scale Carp wasn't exclusive to him—other inner disciples could have taken it as well.

The question was whether that person was still beneath the river.

Regardless, Qi Chuan wasn't concerned. Late-stage Qi Refining inner disciples typically wouldn't bother with the Iceglass Dragon-Scale Carp, opting instead for higher-reward missions involving upper first-grade demonic beasts. Thus, the person here was likely, at most, a peak sixth-layer Qi Refining inner disciple.

"Besides, I'm already here—no point leaving empty-handed. I'll just hunt one quickly and leave. No need to overthink it."

With this in mind, Qi Chuan summoned a small fireball and tossed it onto the ice at his feet. The flames spread, their intense heat silently melting the mystic ice and creating a dark opening that extended downward until it reached the frigid waters below, forming a clear passage.

Then, Qi Chuan slowly descended into the icy river, immediately activating two minor spells: Water Repelling and Invisibility.

Notably, his Invisibility spell had unknowingly reached the minor mastery level. This was due to his habit of using it frequently, even during safe missions. The repeated use, amplified by his golden finger's enhancement, had gradually elevated it to minor mastery.

The Water Repelling spell, however, hadn't been used as often and remained at the basic level.

Once submerged, Qi Chuan began silently gliding through the water, searching for traces of the Iceglass Dragon-Scale Carp.

After some time, he found one—but not just the carp. Another figure was present as well.

"Him?"

Qi Chuan's eyes widened in surprise at the sight before him.

Not far away, a young man—protected by a Water Repelling spell—was locked in combat with a massive Iceglass Dragon-Scale Carp. The creature, several zhang long and seemingly sculpted from crystal-clear ice, thrashed violently as spells clashed, sending turbulent waves through the freezing water.

The young man was none other than Ye Liang, the prodigious scion of the Ye family, who had entered the Fengyue Sect's inner sect at the same time as Qi Chuan. Ye Liang had once sent Qi Chuan a paper crane invitation to his birthday celebration, which Qi Chuan had politely declined.

"To think the person who broke the ice earlier not only stayed but is also someone I know. And judging by Ye Liang's mana fluctuations… has he reached the sixth layer of Qi Refining?" Qi Chuan mused silently, somewhat taken aback.

This development made it even less necessary for Qi Chuan to reveal himself. With his minor mastery Invisibility spell active, Ye Liang would have a hard time detecting him. He could simply wait for Ye Liang to finish his hunt and leave before seeking out another Iceglass Dragon-Scale Carp. There was no need to compete for the same prey.

"Wait—something's wrong!"

Just then, Qi Chuan's eyes narrowed as he spotted two more dark shadows emerging from the murky depths behind Ye Liang.

"Two more Iceglass Dragon-Scale Carp? And they're heading straight for Ye Liang? He really has bad luck today…"

Qi Chuan shook his head slightly, wondering how Ye Liang would handle this situation.

Given that the Ye family was one of the most prominent cultivation clans under the Fengyue Sect, boasting three Foundation Establishment experts, and Ye Liang himself possessed a top-tier spiritual root, he surely had plenty of tricks up his sleeve to deal with this.

Meanwhile, Ye Liang, engaged in battle with the first carp, initially felt no pressure. The creature's strength matched that of an average sixth-layer Qi Refining cultivator, and he was confident he could defeat it soon.

But when he sensed the approach of two more carp, his expression darkened. "Two more? This is bad!"

Against one, he could win. Against two, he might scrape by with full effort. But three? That called for a strategic retreat.

Or so it would seem—under normal circumstances. But the current situation was slightly different.

Ye Liang's gaze flickered toward a seemingly empty patch of dark water to his left, his eyes narrowing slightly as a faint glow flashed in his pupils. A gentle smile curled his lips.

"There's someone hiding there, isn't there? Just arrived… Given the circumstances… perhaps I can use the 'drive the tiger to swallow the wolf' tactic?"

He had once cultivated a pupil technique, allowing him to detect subtle anomalies in the water. Though the other party's concealment was skilled, he could still sense their presence—just not their identity or cultivation level.

But that didn't matter for his plan.

A shadow of cunning flickered in Ye Liang's eyes as he subtly redirected the three carp toward the hidden observer.

"He noticed me? That shouldn't be possible—unless he has a pupil technique?" Qi Chuan was surprised to see Ye Liang leading the carp toward him. Still, minor mastery Invisibility wasn't infallible, and a sixth-layer cultivator like Ye Liang might have sensed something—just not necessarily identified him.

"This guy's intentions aren't exactly honorable…"

"But if he thinks he can force me out, he's mistaken. I'll just stay hidden and let him enjoy his thrilling battle with three carp!"

With a cold smirk, Qi Chuan silently formed hand seals, channeling mana from his dantian.

Boom!

In the next moment, a brilliant yellow light erupted around him, forming a massive hollow sphere of earth—like an impenetrable fortress—encompassing a vast section of the water.

This was no ordinary major mastery Earth Wall technique. It was on the verge of perfection, boasting astonishing defensive power. Even late-stage Qi Refining cultivators would hesitate before attempting to break through it.

A single Earth Wall spell—impervious to all attacks.
