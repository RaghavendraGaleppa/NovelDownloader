# Chapter 21: I Challenge You to a Life-and-Death Duel!

"Second-grade Spirit Gathering Array Disk, thirty-five spirit stones—fair price for all!"

Before the jade platform, after exchanging a few pleasantries, the stall owner took out a jade-colored array disk carved with thirty-six formation patterns, resembling a small pagoda, and handed it to Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan accepted the array disk, examined it carefully, and a look of joy appeared on his face.

It was indeed a second-grade array disk.

With this, he would surely succeed in condensing the "Spirit Dragon Heavenly Water."

However, the cost was indeed steep.

The array disk alone required thirty-five spirit stones. Adding the spirit stones needed to activate the formation, the total expenditure would amount to at least one hundred and fifty!

This sum could practically drain an ordinary Qi Refinement disciple.

"No wonder there are still green dots in the opportunity points—the Four Spirit Jade Pillars are far too costly."

Gu Yuan sighed inwardly.

For the spirit stones needed for the array disk, he had the gift from Fire Dragon Master, plus the ten spirit stones given by Qiu Mingshan when he first entered the sect. He could barely scrape together enough.

But the array disk alone wasn't enough—he still needed spirit stones to activate the formation, which was the major expense.

Gu Yuan was far from having that many spirit stones on hand.

However, he did possess two treasures. The first was naturally the "Jade Dragon Flying Shuttle" given by Fire Dragon Master, and the second was the "Azure Crane Spirit Water."

Come to think of it, Gu Yuan truly had a connection with "dragons." Both of his treasures bore names related to them.

The Jade Dragon Flying Shuttle was a high-grade magical artifact, usable even in the late stages of Qi Refinement. However, it only provided swift flight and lacked offensive capabilities, making its value relatively low. Gu Yuan estimated it could only fetch sixty to seventy spirit stones.

Far from enough for the array disk.

Next was the "Azure Crane Spirit Water."

This was a genuine high-grade spirit water, a rare treasure even in the Azure Peak Daoist Academy.

Ordinary disciples had never even seen it.

Even among the children of noble families, not everyone possessed it.

If Gu Yuan were to offer this, he could certainly gather enough for the array disk.

However, the "Spirit Dragon Heavenly Water" had yet to be successfully condensed. If something went wrong, it would be unfortunate. Thus, Gu Yuan decided to prepare for both possibilities.

"I'll take the array disk."

Gu Yuan took out the spirit stones and purchased the array disk. Then he added, "But as you know, activating the array requires a large number of spirit stones. I don't have that many on hand right now. I'd like to use a treasure as collateral to borrow some from you, with a one-month deadline. If I fail to return the spirit stones after a month, this item will be yours to sell. If I return the spirit stones, the item remains mine. What do you think?"

"Oh?"

"What item is it?"

The figure behind the jade platform was slightly taken aback.

This was essentially pawning.

But over a hundred spirit stones was no small sum. What treasure could be worth that much?

"Take a look, senior brother!"

Gu Yuan took out a jade vial and showed it to the other party.

"Azure Crane Spirit Water!"

The figure on the jade platform immediately grew excited.

"An actual high-grade spirit water!"

"I'll offer two hundred—no, two hundred and forty spirit stones! Sell it to me directly, how about it?"

This was a genuine treasure. Even if he couldn't use it himself, selling it to a noble family's disciple would fetch a hefty profit.

Gu Yuan shook his head.

If the Spirit Dragon Heavenly Water failed to condense, this item would be his lifeline for breaking through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement. Selling it now was out of the question.

"Senior brothers, I have a way to handle this treasure. Would you like to hear it?"

At that moment, the figure who had guided Gu Yuan into the Heavenly Palace suddenly spoke up.

"What method do you propose?"

Gu Yuan asked.

"Senior brother urgently needs spirit stones now. Brother Ma and I can pool some together and lend them to you."

"Then, Brother Ma and I can spread the word that in one month, the black market may have 'Azure Crane Spirit Water' for sale, stirring up interest."

"If, after a month, senior brother still wishes to sell the spirit water, we can hold an auction and fetch a high price. Senior brother takes the lion's share, while Brother Ma and I take a small cut."

"If senior brother decides not to sell, then you can pay us some interest and reclaim the spirit water. How does that sound?"

The figure proposed.

Under this arrangement, he and "Brother Ma" stood to lose nothing.

And Gu Yuan's cost would be minimal—just some interest.

"Let's proceed with this method!"

After a moment of contemplation, Gu Yuan agreed.

Since he wanted to prepare for both outcomes, some extra expenditure was unavoidable.

The three then signed a contract in the Heavenly Palace, sealing the agreement.

The contract bore the imprint of a Golden Core cultivator, making it unbreakable and highly secure.

Gu Yuan left the "Azure Crane Spirit Water" in the Heavenly Palace for safekeeping, then departed the black market with one hundred and fifty spirit stones and the array disk.

……

The Heavenly Star Black Market, forged with a Golden Core seal, lived up to its reputation. With a single thought, Gu Yuan exited the black market.

Not only that, but he didn't reappear at the pavilion's entrance. Instead, he emerged amidst the bustling crowd of the market, his presence perfectly concealed by the flow of people.

Gu Yuan pretended to browse the market casually for a while before mounting the Cloud-Treading Shuttle issued by the Daoist Academy and returning to his cave abode.

But at the entrance of his cave, he saw a familiar figure.

Lan Tianlu, with his silver hair and blue eyes, sat astride a celestial horse, waiting outside Gu Yuan's cave.

"Senior Brother Gu!"

Upon seeing Gu Yuan, Lan Tianlu dismounted and bowed respectfully.

"Junior Brother Lan?!"

Gu Yuan narrowed his eyes slightly, looking at the seemingly calm young man before him, and chuckled lightly.

He had known they would meet again, but he hadn't expected it to be so soon.

"It seems... the Golden Core's favor has come to an end."

Gu Yuan sighed inwardly.

Though the young man before him appeared respectful, his acting was far inferior to "Senior Brother Yang's" performance in the Demon Cave.

A cold killing intent was palpable.

Clearly, he had already learned the truth about Gu Yuan's admission.

But Gu Yuan had long prepared for this and had a countermeasure ready, so he remained unruffled.

"Senior Brother Gu, I was too rash the other day. It was my fault. To make amends, I'd like to help you relocate to a cave abode on Azure Light Island."

"The spiritual energy concentration on Azure Light Island is thirty percent higher than here. Moreover, that cave abode was previously occupied by a noble family's disciple and is filled with treasures and shell maidens—luxurious and splendid. Won't you consider moving there?"

"All expenses will be covered by me!"

Lan Tianlu spoke humbly, his tone pleading.

But Gu Yuan only chuckled.

"What about this cave abode, then?"

"Since I've erred, I should be punished. I'll reflect on my mistakes here in this cave!"

Lan Tianlu remained bowing.

"Junior Brother Lan... If I were you, I'd immediately summon an elder in the Foundation Establishment stage, find some pretext to detain me, and then force me to exchange cave abodes."

"Or, I'd tempt you with top-grade spirit water or Foundation Establishment treasures to trade caves."

"Or, I'd invoke the academy's laws and challenge you to a 'life-and-death duel.'"

"Not like this, offering trivial benefits and speaking childish words, making a fool of myself."

Gu Yuan shook his head.

"Gu Yuan!"

"You opportunistic upstart!"

"How dare you steal my opportunity!"

"You refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit—you're unworthy of top-grade spirit water!"

"A life-and-death duel!"

"I challenge you to a life-and-death duel!"

Gu Yuan's words shattered Lan Tianlu's composure. He abruptly raised his head, his eyes blazing with fury and killing intent.

"Boom!"

Blue lightning surged from Lan Tianlu's palm as a falcon-shaped talisman shot forth with tremendous force, streaking toward Gu Yuan's brow.
