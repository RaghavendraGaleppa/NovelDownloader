# Chapter 84: Why is She Acting So Strange Today?

Master went to the Scripture Pavilion in a rush, without even eating breakfast. She said she was going to review knowledge related to the Internal Breath Realm.

Noon.

Wisps of cooking smoke rose from Autumn Water Pavilion.

"No movement all morning."

"Did the Ice Block really run into some trouble?"

"Or is it because of yesterday's spar..."

Li Mo's mind conjured the image of yesterday, when he had tackled the Ice Block to the ground. After all, she was a woman, and it happened in plain sight. Could it be that she was embarrassed and didn't want to see him?

"That's unlikely... right?" Li Mo didn't think Ying Bing had that kind of personality. After much thought, he decided to go upstairs and check.

Carrying the prepared dishes, he went upstairs and knocked loudly on the wooden door. No response. Li Mo blinked, used some force, and the door creaked open. As soon as he entered, Little Li was stunned.

The room was comparable to a cold storage. On the cracked bed, where someone should have been sleeping, there was a large block of ice. Inside the ice block was a girl, hugging her knees, her life status unknown.

It was Ying Bing. A true, ice block.

Li Mo: "!"

No, how did you manage to seal yourself in ice? There wasn't that much water in the room! It was highly unscientific.

Thump thump thump—

"Ice Block."

"Ice Block?"

Li Mo knocked on the ice block, called out twice with no reply, and no longer caring whether it was reasonable or not, he prepared to smash the ice block open.

Whoosh—

But halfway through extending his fist, he abruptly stopped. This pale blue ice was clearly not formed from ordinary water vapor; it was incredibly solid. Who knew if the Ice Block would also go *crunch* if the ice shattered?

"That's right, Internal Breath!" Li Mo suddenly remembered that he was already a martial artist in the Internal Breath Condensation Realm. He reached out and channeled several wisps of internal breath into the ice block.

Swish swish—

Under his control, the internal breath was like a precise carving knife, slowly eroding the solid ice. The speed was not fast.

.......

Half an hour later.

The Ice Block was finally 'rescued'. Her eyes were tightly shut, her delicate brows furrowed, as if she was having a nightmare, but fortunately, her breathing was stable. Just as Little Li was wondering if his good intentions had led to a bad outcome, Ying Bing's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

"You..." Li Mo originally wanted to ask her how she was, but swallowed the words.

What a complicated pair of eyes they were. He had never seen the Ice Block reveal such an expression towards anything. The former Ying Bing was always indifferent and cold, as if it was extremely difficult for anything to truly touch her heart. She always seemed confident and clearly knew what she was doing. But now, Li Mo saw in her eyes... confusion? Complexity?

"Yesterday, were you deliberate?" After a long while, Ying Bing's faint voice came.

During the spar, Li Mo clearly hadn't shown strength exceeding hers. That could only mean he was hiding his true abilities. Ying Bing herself had once walked at night in brocade robes, an experience of hiding her strength.

Li Mo: "!"

Sure enough, she was still hung up on yesterday's events? And she even 'isolated herself' because of this? Something's not right! Is this still the Ice Block? Why is she acting so strange today?

"My apologies." Li Mo smiled awkwardly.

Ying Bing lowered her gaze. He admitted it.

He had indeed held back during their spar. Ying Bing's breathing quickened slightly.

"Why?"

"..." Little Li was rendered silent by the question. He just did it accidentally, there was no 'why'. If he absolutely had to find a reason...

"Because of the hammer." Li Mo took out the Star Mortar from his sleeve.

"Cataclysmic Meteorite Hammer?" Ying Bing blurted out.

Divine weapon? No... it just looked the same, a mere imitation without true divine essence. This was merely a Profound Weapon, a counterfeit.

Li Mo: "!"

How did the Ice Block know? That day on Divine Weapon Peak, hadn't they agreed that no fourth person should know about this? Could it be... Master? Thinking of Shang Wu, Little Li immediately understood. Master must have drunk too much one day and accidentally revealed something.

Li Mo sighed and said: "The Cataclysmic Meteorite Hammer is indeed with me. Don't tell anyone else." He added, "It was a move born of helplessness. I hope you don't mind..."

Anyway, the Ice Block wasn't an outsider; it was fine if she knew.

"A move born of helplessness..." Ying Bing pondered, her eyes flickering, as if a mist had cleared in her heart. She seemed to understand. That day, the commotion in Divine Edge Cave was because the Cataclysmic Meteorite Hammer acknowledged its master. That weapon master was Li Mo. A divine weapon, naturally, could not be easily displayed to others.

"You... can you activate a divine weapon?" Ying Bing asked seriously.

"Barely." Li Mo helplessly spread his hands. "Unless it's a matter of life and death, I'd rather not." If he were to activate it when he was at the Great Perfection of the Blood Qi Realm, it could at most augment the power of the World Seed for a single breath. If he continued for even slightly longer, he would be exhausted and injured.

"No wonder... no wonder..." Ying Bing understood.

The system ranked based on combat power. The combat power here did not include external objects. For example, if someone possessed a powerful hidden weapon that was consumed after one use, then that hidden weapon could not be included as part of their inherent combat power. Li Mo was the master of a divine weapon and could barely activate it. Naturally, the divine weapon would be counted as part of his combat power.

The might of a divine weapon... Ying Bing recalled the scene from her previous life when Shang Wu activated the Cataclysmic Meteorite Hammer; with one strike, mountains toppled, as if a meteor had fallen from the sky. That kind of power was beyond human capability. Could she withstand it? The answer was definitely no. No matter how invincible she was in the same realm or capable of fighting above her level, she could not withstand the might of a divine weapon in the Internal Breath Realm.

But... activating a divine weapon in the Blood Qi Realm? Didn't that sound like a fantasy? She didn't understand how he did it. But... this move was no different from exploiting a loophole in the system. As long as she couldn't withstand the divine weapon, she would be suppressed by Li Mo for one more day.

"Now that everything's clear, it's fine. Let's eat, let's eat."

"Mmm... alright."

In Ying Bing's life, she had encountered many greater difficulties than this. She wasn't afraid of difficulties; she was afraid of the unknown. It was good to understand the reason. A divine weapon wouldn't grow, but her cultivation realm was advancing by leaps and bounds. In the near future, the Cataclysmic Meteorite Hammer would no longer be an obstacle to her. Perhaps, the next time? If she could get the system's reward...

[Host, please strictly adhere to the punishment terms.]

For the first time, Ying Bing felt the food was tasteless. That strange, unfamiliar sensation welled up in her heart again, refusing to dissipate.

Sharing a bed... for a month...
