Chapter 77: A One-Sided Beatdown, Shang Wu: "Haters, Speak Up!"

On the arena stage.

When enemies meet, their eyes burn with animosity, and the air was originally thick with gunpowder. But hearing those familiar voices cheering him on, Li Mo felt his toes curl with embarrassment, completely oblivious to Wang Hao's predatory gaze.

"Please, stop chanting," he silently pleaded.

"Let me see what you're made of, Junior Brother Li." Wang Hao's internal energy surged throughout his body, his qi-mechanism already locking onto Li Mo opposite him. The moment Qian Bufan's "Begin!" fell, he shot towards Li Mo like an arrow released from a bowstring.

His fists faintly emitted a dark glow, clearly indicating he wore special gauntlets. With a single punch, the whistling wind seemed to roar like tigers and leopards, and the surging internal energy resonated like thunder. Many within Qingyuan Sect recognized this move of his. It was the signature skill of Futu, an Inner Elder, a high-grade martial art: Tiger-Leopard Thunder Hand.

"Good move," Li Mo thought, excitement rising within his heart. All things considered, this was his first proper fight against another person. The last time he fought Cui Peng, Cui Peng was already half-dead and couldn't even exchange a few moves before being killed.

He didn't draw his sword. With a similar tremor of his muscles and bones, his thirty-six meridians surged with qi and blood, his waist twisted, and he directly met the punch head-on.

Wang Hao was startled at first, then a sinister curve formed on his lips. It seems his opponent was relying on his reputation, unwilling to use the Scarlet Firmament Sword, or perhaps to show off the advantage of a weapon? He had originally worried that his gauntlets wouldn't withstand many blows from a Profound Weapon. Li Mo's action played right into his hands. Facing a higher-ranked opponent, not using his full strength immediately, and even being overconfident out of concern for his reputation—today, he would let his opponent experience true ruthlessness...

But could he really?

"Huh? A Qi-Blood Realm cultivator fighting an Internal Energy Realm cultivator, and he's not even using a weapon?"

"Not only no weapon, he doesn't seem to be using any martial arts either."

"True Heir Li has a foundation in body tempering. I often see him in Divine Edge Cave. Perhaps he has another trump card?"

"Even body tempering taken to the extreme of the Qi-Blood Realm can't be that exaggerated, right? Otherwise, everyone would just practice body tempering; who would bother learning other martial arts?"

"Isn't his sword dao attainment formidable?"

...

A Qi-Blood Realm cultivator, without a weapon, brawling with an Internal Energy Realm cultivator who *is* using a weapon. Who wouldn't be confused by this?

However... in an instant, the two fists collided.

*Clang—*

A bare fist against a gauntlet surprisingly produced a sound like a tolling bell. A circle of dust swept out from their center. A figure stumbled backward, leaving a series of deep indentations on the ground. When they clearly saw who had retreated, everyone froze in place as if they had seen a ghost.

It was Wang Hao!

Wang Hao's face was pale, his smile frozen at the corners of his mouth. The arm that had just clashed with the other was trembling uncontrollably. He hadn't practiced body tempering, but that didn't mean his physical condition was poor. Even without internal energy, he wasn't inferior to common spirit beasts. And just now, he *had* used internal energy.

How could Li Mo's strength be so immense?

Before his thoughts could settle, the figure of the young man opposite him vanished from his spot. Of course, he didn't disappear into thin air; it was Wind Shadow Steps. Wang Hao also employed his movement technique. However, Li Mo's figure swept in like a passing hurricane, following him like a shadow.

What was little student Li thinking in his heart right now? Hmm... On the arena, intentional killing wasn't allowed. He was wondering if beating his opponent to death would be a bad idea. Let alone taking out his hammer. Even using his sword, the sharpness of Scarlet Firmament, combined with the sword techniques he had spent many martial insights cultivating while oscillating between the "ice block" and Jiang Churong, was definitely not something Wang Hao could withstand.

He also wanted to test the limits of his body—a body that felt capable of matching an Internal Energy Realm cultivator even without resorting to supreme techniques—to see just how far its potential truly stretched.

In an instant, Li Mo appeared before Wang Hao. The two exchanged a glance. Under the gaze of those fiery pupils, Wang Hao inexplicably felt a chill in his heart and swallowed hard. But then, shameful anger rose within him. In the history of the Nine Peaks Martial Meet, never before had an Internal Energy Jade Liquid Realm cultivator looked so pathetic in front of a Qi-Blood Realm cultivator.

He was furious, but it was of no use. A sharp pain shot through his waist, temporarily robbing him of the ability to think.

"Inner armor?" Li Mo furrowed his brow. When he had just punched, the sensation wasn't that of hitting the opponent's body. "So, you're pretty resistant to beatings, huh?"

"Wait..." A bad premonition rose in Wang Hao's heart, and he didn't even have time to finish his sentence.

"True Heir Li was engaged in close combat by Wang Hao?"

"No, it's Wang Hao who was engaged in close combat by True Heir Li!"

Again, Tiger-Leopard Thunder Hand collided with an ordinary punch.

*Crack—*

The gauntlet was dented by the impact. Seizing the opportunity, Li Mo took advantage of his opponent's shaken state to mercilessly beat a "dog in the water," driving an elbow into his chest. The "Unified Qi Penetration" of Liuhe Fist was executed by him in a single, fluid motion. Fists, elbows, knees...

*Thump, thump, thump—*

Wang Hao, clad in inner armor, was brutally beaten by Li Mo on the arena stage. His liquefied internal energy was completely useless now, only able to protect his vital points. It wasn't that he hadn't tried to fight back. But... he couldn't break through the defense at all!

"Wait... wait..."

*Thump, thump, thump, thump—*

"I... I surr..."

*Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump!*

The bluestone arena floor was now riddled with spiderweb-like cracks from the pounding. Compared to a contest between experts, this looked more like a street brawl. And a completely one-sided one, an adult beating a child. The scene was incredibly brutal.

"Gulp... ho... holy crap..."

"This True Heir Li... is he even human?"

"Good thing I agreed when he advised me not to relieve myself anywhere last time, otherwise it's hard to say if I'd be incontinent right now..."

"True Heir Li usually seems gentle and refined, like a good-natured gentleman, but why is he so terrifying when he starts fighting?"

"Don't forget who his master is..."

...

Many gazes at this moment couldn't bear to look at the stage. Especially when they saw Wang Hao trying to crawl off the stage to concede, only to be grabbed by the ankle and dragged back, his fingernails carving ten marks into the ground—everyone couldn't help but break out in cold sweat. Too brutal. Those who had brought family members quickly covered the children's eyes.

"Phew, luckily I didn't fight Brother Li..." Xiao Qin sighed deeply. Frankly, Wang Hao was currently stronger than him. If he were to face him, and his master didn't help, he wouldn't even have a ten percent chance of winning.

"Master, is this the benefit you spoke of, where the Qi-Blood Realm foundation is stronger than ordinary people's?"

"Were you this strong in the Qi-Blood Realm back then?" Old Xiao, who hadn't seen much of the world, asked.

"Uh... hmm, more or less." Thousand Forms Martial Venerable's voice was a little wavering.

"Master, why does your voice sound weak?" Xiao Qin was puzzled. Hadn't his master recovered a lot after using the Deep Yin Soul Nourishing Wood?

"Ahem, oh, this little friend Li has somewhat exceeded this master's expectations. Besides, the Soul Nourishing Wood doesn't take effect that quickly." Thousand Forms Martial Venerable's aged voice had still not regained its former inscrutability. He was also dumbfounded. How many meridians did this kid have? Had he misjudged him?

"It's good to be alive..." Lin Jiang swallowed, his sweaty palms fiercely wiping on his clothes. Although Brother Li's fists hadn't landed on him, just thinking about it sent shivers down his spine.

"Mm-hmm!" Murong Xiao nodded vigorously. It was a good thing he reacted quickly back then; looking back now, that was truly the wisest decision he had ever made in his life. At this moment, the gazes around them no longer held any doubt, only admiration and praise. How could they have been throwing the match? This was called foresight!

On the high platform. Shang Wu waved her delicate fists, her almond eyes flickering with satisfaction. Her precious disciple was indeed not taken in wrongly. She suddenly stood up, her gaze sweeping over the many stunned elders. She channeled qi to her dantian:

"Haters, speak up!"
