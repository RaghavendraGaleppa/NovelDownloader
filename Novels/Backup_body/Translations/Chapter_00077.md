# Chapter 77: He Exists Beyond the Cycle of Life and Death!

Immortality!

Every cultivator in this world seeks the path to immortality, ascension to the heavens, and eternal life!  
Three thousand years ago, it was widely believed that the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign had achieved immortality and ascended. Yet, he was ultimately buried in the dust of the mortal world.  

Since then, no one has ever attained immortality or become a true immortal!  

Yet now, this Netherworld Marshal before them—a deity from ancient legends—claims that the founding Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhou Dynasty has achieved immortality?  

But wasn’t he at the end of his lifespan when he came here to suppress the source of the sinister energy? He even believed he couldn’t contain it alone and sought to lure the Debt Collector here, using his hands to seal the source of corruption!  

From the current perspective, it seems he also intended to use the Netherworld Marshal’s power to kill the Debt Collector!  

But how could someone who came here to die have achieved immortality?  

"The founding Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhou Dynasty was a figure at the pinnacle of this world. Perhaps after entering Fengdu Mountain, he took the final step and reached the level of the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official murmured.  

"Perhaps..." Li Zhengjing glanced over. "Could it be related to the Debt Collector’s opportunity?"  

"That doesn’t make sense," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "Various sects have all obtained opportunities, yet none have achieved immortality. Moreover, the Debt Collector is the true master of these opportunities—why hasn’t he ascended? And when he came here, he was clearly blocked by the Xuancha Ghost King. This proves that the Grand Preceptor achieved immortality, but the Debt Collector did not!"  

"Could it be..." The Hanging-Wall Bird raised its wing and scratched its head with the green dragon horn atop it. "He took that final step and reached the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign’s level but didn’t dare to ascend, so he borrowed a path through the Netherworld to reach the immortal realm?"  

"But based on my deductions, that Netherworld may not be the one we know," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said. "We live in the turbid mortal world, while that place is filled with yin energy and wandering souls. Yet it’s merely another realm of cultivation—perhaps even just a blessed land attached to the mortal world!"  

"Regardless, the founding Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhou Dynasty did come to Fengdu Mountain. He bypassed the grand formation, crossed the broken bridge, and continued forward along this path."  

Li Zhengjing’s expression shifted. He glanced at the golden page, but it showed nothing. He turned his head and asked, "We came here for an opportunity. Are we leaving empty-handed?"  

"That can’t be!"  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official looked at the Xuancha Ghost King and whispered, "The opportunity I mentioned to you was the Dao treasure left behind by the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign! The World-Saving Golden Ship discovered in his tomb that before his ascension, he once came here..."  

Before Fengdu Mountain collapsed, a helmsman of the World-Saving Golden Ship was sent to investigate!  

When the news spread, the Void Extreme True Immortal was dispatched and happened to witness the mountain’s collapse, encountering the 'True God.' That was when he went mad.  

Most factions in the world believe the collapse of Fengdu Mountain and the invasion of millions of demonic spirits were the work of the World-Saving Golden Ship.  

"Records state that the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign came here and encountered ancient Netherworld deities, stopping at this point!"  

"But for some reason, he left his lifebound Dao treasure here!"  

"The third-generation World-Saving Heavenly Venerable once speculated that if the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign hadn’t left his treasure at Fengdu Mountain, he might have survived the tribulation of ascension and avoided being buried in dust."  

"The Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign left his lifebound treasure here, likely because Fengdu Mountain was already unstable three thousand years ago."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official continued, "The treasure he left behind may have delayed the mountain’s collapse by three thousand years..."  

He looked ahead and said, "Since the Xuancha Ghost King is blocking the path, the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign must have stopped here back then. Logically, the treasure he left behind should also be here!"  

Yuan Zhengfeng hesitated. "Could it be that the founding Grand Preceptor took the Heavenly Azure Dao treasure into the Netherworld?"  

Li Zhengjing frowned slightly. "Hard to say."  

The Hanging-Wall Bird couldn’t resist speaking up. "Why not just ask the Xuancha Ghost King?"  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official fell silent, giving the bird a look as if it were an idiot.  

Yuan Zhengfeng didn’t respond, likely cursing the bird in his mind.  

Li Zhengjing sighed. "This Xuancha Ghost King guards this place, forbidding the living from passing. If not for the respect he holds for the 'Remnant Corpse of the Netherworld Lord' that Elder Yuan inhabits, he would have already killed us. Why would he answer our questions now?"  

"Why make it so complicated?"  

The Hanging-Wall Bird looked puzzled. "Though they’ve lived for many years, their knowledge might not surpass mine. After all, we’ve all studied extensively, but they’ve been trapped here while I read every day. Over time, my knowledge must exceed theirs!"  

With that, the bird poked its head out confidently. "Watch as I use my brilliant plan to make them spill the truth!"  

"..."  

Silence fell.  

The Hanging-Wall Bird took a deep breath and spoke in human tongue.  

"I heard that three thousand years ago, there was a legendary treasure here. Was it taken by Old Zhou into the Netherworld?"  

It continued, "The stupid ones need not answer. Let the smartest among you speak!"  

"Who are you calling stupid? Who’s stupid?" The left head grew furious. "It’s insulting us! Not even the Netherworld Lord’s face can save you now! Kill it!"  

"I’m the smartest! I’ll answer!" The middle head declared. "In life, I was a scholar of great learning!"  

"It was Old Zhou who took it!" The right head blurted out. "And he packed it into a bundle, placing it right behind us!"  

"..."  

The other two heads turned to glare at the rightmost one, their expressions filled with extreme displeasure.  

The scene fell into silence.  

Li Zhengjing opened his mouth but said nothing.  

Yuan Zhengfeng also remained silent, while the Hanging-Wall Bird preened proudly. "See? I outsmarted them!"  

"We underestimated them!"  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official whispered, "Earlier, the Xuancha Ghost King attacked the Void Extreme True Immortal, expending divine energy in the process. The clash of consciousnesses left him in a daze—basically half as insane as the Void Extreme True Immortal!"  

Li Zhengjing’s eyes lit up. "Strike while the iron is hot! Ask more questions!"  

He stepped forward. "Which wise elder among you can return Old Zhou’s belongings to me? He’s a long-lost relative of mine..."  

The three heads of the Xuancha Ghost King fell silent.  

Then the Void Extreme True Immortal suddenly shouted, "I’m Old Zhou’s father! I’m here to find my son—let me through to see him!"  

"Who are you fooling? Earlier, you called him an old man, saying you could’ve killed him with one hand in your youth. Now you’re his father?" The left head sneered.  

"Do you think we’re so addled by the clash of energies that we’d believe this?" The middle head scoffed.  

"Unless you defeat us, you’re not getting through!" The right head said firmly.  

"Could Your Excellency deliver the bundle to us?" Li Zhengjing bowed.  

"No! Old Zhou didn’t give us anything in return!" The middle head shook its head.  

"Behind us lies the Netherworld. Where you stand isn’t the living world, but it’s still the border between realms." The right head spoke solemnly. "Though we seem close, we’re separated by two worlds—infinitely far apart..."  

"Most importantly, letting you pass or us stepping forward would violate Netherworld law!" The left head declared. "We abide by the rules here!"  

"Turn back." The right head’s voice grew deeper, losing its earlier simplicity.  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing and the others exchanged glances.  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official sighed. "He’s so powerful that aside from the legendary 'Debt Collector,' no one in history has ever forced their way through. Even the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign stopped here before his ascension! There’s nothing we can do—we’ll have to leave empty-handed."  

Yuan Zhengfeng didn’t respond. For him, entering Fengdu Mountain and awakening was already a great boon. With the Yin-Yang Five Elements Creation Tree, he could now walk the mortal world.  

Not being taken by the Netherworld deities was a stroke of luck!  

And recovering the old sect master’s remains was another blessing!  

Only the Void Extreme True Immortal seemed dissatisfied, roaring and insisting on going forward.  

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing fell deep in thought.  

He focused his mind and looked at the golden page.  

**Fortune:** Returning empty-handed without obtaining the Heavenly Azure Dao treasure. During the breakthrough to the True Qi realm, the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi’s sharpness proves too overwhelming, tearing through the body, leaving it riddled with holes, intestines ruptured, and features unrecognizable!  
**Afterward, the Thousand Illusion Divine Monarch flies into a rage, dismembers the body, grinds the bones to dust, and leaves no corpse intact!**  

**Method to Alter Fate:** ...Insufficient spiritual energy!  

"Senior, do you have spirit stones?" Li Zhengjing suddenly asked.  

"I have twenty refined spirit stones on me." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official took them out, puzzled. "You’re still at the Inner Breath realm, unable to refine spirit stones. What use are they to you?"  

"Lend them to me. I’ll repay you later."  

Li Zhengjing took the stones and swallowed them one by one, this time without hiding his actions. The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official and the Hanging-Wall Bird stared in shock.  

Yuan Zhengfeng, having replenished his energy with spirit stones before, remained calm.  

The Void Extreme True Immortal muttered in confusion, "Mortals swallow gold to commit suicide. Cultivators swallow spirit stones to kill themselves? Is the Young Sect Master trying to die so he can enter the Netherworld? What a clever plan!"  

His eyes lit up. "Bastard! Lend me some stones—I want in too!"  

Before he finished speaking, Li Zhengjing swallowed the "Broken Jade" on the World-Saving Boat and leaped into the air!  

Boom!  

His left arm unleashed the Blazing Sun Divine Sword!  

Flames filled the sky, sword qi surged ominously!  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official and the Hanging-Wall Bird were stunned.  

The Void Extreme True Immortal shouted, "Wait for me!"  

"Audacious! You dare force your way through?"  

The Xuancha Ghost King mobilized his divine energy. Despite the chaos in his consciousness, his duty remained unwavering!  

**Guard this checkpoint!**  
**No living beings may pass!**  

Even with the Remnant Corpse of the Netherworld Lord, this rule could not be broken!  

"Kill!"  

The Xuancha Ghost King stirred the heavens!  

The Yellow Springs surged violently!  
Yin energy swept in all directions!  

"Come!"  

Li Zhengjing’s left arm unleashed the Blazing Sun Divine Sword!  

He activated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique and swung the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber!  

This strike was the Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Saber Technique!  

"Audacious!"  

All three heads of the Xuancha Ghost King roared in unison!  

But to everyone’s shock, the ghost king froze momentarily!  

From Li Zhengjing’s body erupted the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, carrying the might to suppress hell!  

The Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber also bore the power to vanquish evil!  

The Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Saber Technique borrowed the might of heavenly thunder!  

The Blazing Sun Divine Sword, rooted in sword qi, was unleashed with the Blazing Sun divine ability—its flames countered yin energy!  

Only now did everyone realize that every skill Li Zhengjing possessed countered evil spirits!  

The Xuancha Ghost King took the full force of the Blazing Sun Divine Sword unharmed, but under the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, he faltered for an instant!  

The Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Saber Technique, executed with the Dragon-Patterned Saber, unleashed thunderous might that shook the surroundings!  

"Go all out!"  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official wasted no time, unleashing dual Dao techniques and spitting out Blazing Sun flames!  

The Hanging-Wall Bird, as an auspicious divine creature, naturally repelled evil. It too spat Blazing Sun flames!  

The Void Extreme True Immortal was ecstatic. "Our group has been at odds this whole journey. Now, at last, we’re united in charging to our deaths!"  

He fought most fiercely, charging straight at the Xuancha Ghost King!  

The battle erupted instantly!  

Yellow Springs churned!  
Yin energy surged!  
Divine might shook the heavens!  

In mere moments, the Xuancha Ghost King roared, his three heads and six arms suppressing all living beings before him!  

In less than three breaths, the entire group was defeated!  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official, the Void Extreme True Immortal, and even the flame-spitting Hanging-Wall Bird were all knocked down!  

"Pathetic!"  

All three heads of the Xuancha Ghost King bellowed!  

But then they realized that amidst the chaos, one figure had vanished.  

The left and right heads turned to see the young man already standing on the other side of the bridge, having slipped past them to their rear!  

Li Zhengjing, empowered by Human Immortal-level energy, crossed a hundred yards in an instant!  

"The method to alter fate points here!"  

His eyes gleamed as he pressed his hand into the void!  

The yin energy dispersed, revealing a green cloth bundle floating beside the bridge!  

This was the item left behind by the Great Zhou Grand Preceptor!  

He grabbed it!  

"Seeking death!"  

The Xuancha Ghost King turned, his six arms descending like a collapsing sky!  

Li Zhengjing flipped backward, leaping off the bridge into the Yellow Springs!  

Boom!!!  

The impact shattered another section of the bridge!  

"Come back!"  

Enraged, the Xuancha Ghost King unleashed Netherworld spells, blasting the water and churning up massive waves!  

Beneath the water, Li Zhengjing’s skin was already corroding, and countless vengeful spirits swarmed him!  

He activated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique. With Human Immortal-level energy, he instantly scattered the spirits!  

Sinking deeper, he swam desperately forward.  

His body was corroding, and his vision failed.  

"The Yellow Springs’ water dissolves flesh and soul! You’ll be completely erased!"  

Yuan Zhengfeng’s voice was frantic. "What are you trying to do? If you can’t get the opportunity, just go back and find another way! Why risk your life like this?"  

Even so, Yuan Zhengfeng acted swiftly, taking control of Li Zhengjing’s body to protect his head, organs, and bones from complete dissolution!  

The surrounding waters churned as the Xuancha Ghost King’s spells bombarded them relentlessly!  

Then, something coiled around Li Zhengjing’s waist and yanked him from the depths!  

"Young Master, are you alright?"  

It was the voice of the Five Elements Creation Tree, now awakened.  

The vine that pulled him out was one of its branches, now impervious to yin energy and the Yellow Springs’ water.  

"Run!"  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official bellowed, fleeing madly on the World-Saving Boat.  

The Xuancha Ghost King gave chase with terrifying fury!  

But then, the atmosphere shifted again.  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official glanced back, puzzled.  

The ghost king was still pursuing, but despite his power, he hadn’t closed the distance.  

"Seemingly close, yet separated by two worlds?"  

He recalled the right head’s earlier words and relaxed slightly—but a greater question arose: "How did that kid cross two worlds in an instant?"  

Confused but undeterred, he led the group onto the bridge, stowed the boat, and fled back the way they came.  

The Xuancha Ghost King chased for a while longer before losing sight of them.  

"No need to chase. They’ve returned to the mortal world via Fengdu Mountain," the right head said.  

"Something’s off with you!" The middle head glared. "First, you spared them in the Netherworld Lord’s name. Then you kept hinting about the Debt Collector, Old Zhou, and the treasure..."  

"More than that!" The left head added. "When that kid attacked, his tiger-leopard roar stunned us briefly. Their combined assault was no threat—we could’ve easily captured him!"  

"You let them go!" The middle head accused.  

"The spirit in the Netherworld Lord’s remnant corpse, that strange bird, and that kid are all from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect," the right head sighed. "Though I’m dead, I was once the sect’s leader..."  

"Old Zhou recommended you for this divine body as a Netherworld Marshal—not to show favoritism!" The left head snapped.  

"This was Old Zhou’s plan," the right head said calmly. "But we didn’t expect the one taking the bundle to be a junior we never considered. Since he took it, it’s his opportunity now..."  

"You’re dead! You shouldn’t interfere with the living world!" The middle head barked.  

"What’s done is done. I’ll accept punishment."  

The other two heads exchanged glances, then produced paper and brush to record the incident.  

"List their names for the Judge to note—severe punishment!"  

"Got the register. Copying now!"  

"The bird’s called White Hanging-Wall, the tree’s the Yin-Yang Five Elements Creation Tree, and there’s a Divine King Gu larva."  

"The half-dead guy in the Netherworld Lord’s corpse is Yuan Zhengfeng."  

"The freak is the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official."  

"The lunatic’s Dao title is Void Extreme."  

"Names recorded. Reporting now!"  

"Wait... something’s missing?"  

"Impossible! We copied from the register—no mistakes! Anyone who comes here is listed. Huh? The numbers don’t match!"  

"What about the kid who took the bundle? Where’s his name?"  

"Check again!"  

The Xuancha Ghost King pored over the register, even the right head—once the Feather Transformation Sect’s leader—joining in.  

Three heads, six hands, searched for a long time before exchanging baffled looks.
