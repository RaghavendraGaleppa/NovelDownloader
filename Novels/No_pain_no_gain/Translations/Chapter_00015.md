# Chapter 15: Gaining a Trump Card

In Divine Hands Valley, even with Han Zhen's affairs being hotly discussed, Han Li was not affected in the slightest. Doctor Mo, to allow Han Li to focus on his cultivation without external interference, temporarily sealed off the entire Divine Hands Valley.

Han Li had been excited for several days ever since he discovered the secret of the small bottle. During this period, every night, while diligently practicing his skills, Han Li observed the bottle's changes, all the while worrying about its secret being discovered by others. Every night at a certain hour, the bottle would attract white strands of light, which would converge into small white specks, subsequently absorbed and swallowed by the bottle. This unusual phenomenon continued until the eighth day when it finally ceased.

Immediately after, the dark green patterns on the bottle suddenly emitted a dazzling green light. Golden characters and symbols also emerged on the bottle's surface, imbued with an indescribable ancient charm. These symbols had fluid structures and peculiar strokes, constantly moving and flickering across the bottle's body. But it was only for a fleeting moment before this strange phenomenon quickly vanished. Han Li casually picked up the bottle. After the bizarre occurrences on the bottle over the past few days, Han Li was no longer as surprised as he initially was. Following his routine, he tried to open the cap, and effortlessly, the cap was easily removed.

Han Li tilted his head to look into the bottle's opening, finding a single drop of jade-green liquid within, which cast a verdant hue throughout the entire bottle. Han Li lowered his head and sniffed, detecting no fragrant scent of precious medicine. He couldn't help but feel a little disappointed; his dream of becoming a martial arts master was shattered once more. Han Li also thought of Brother Zhen; when would the martial arts manual he promised him finally be given to him? As for the secret of the small bottle, Han Li buried it deep in his heart, intending not to tell anyone.

After Han Zhen returned to Seven Mysteries Sect, his doorstep was quickly worn out. There were those who didn't believe Han Zhen's achievements and came to challenge him, those who came to propose marriages, and even many high-ranking members of the sect sent him numerous precious herbs and gifts. Han Zhen naturally accepted all the gifts without exception, but sent all visitors away, refusing to meet them. Until one day, someone saw Sect Master Wang and three unfamiliar martial uncles visit Han Zhen's residence, and on that day, thunderous explosions reverberated from the mountain. Soon after, a prohibition came from within the sect: no one, except Master Wu, was allowed to disturb Han Zhen without the Sect Master's permission. This was because Han Zhen had given the three Grand Martial Uncles a reason they couldn't refuse: he had hope of reaching the Grandmaster realm within ten years. In reality, Han Zhen had scheduled his move against Doctor Mo and was making preparations.

It would take another two years for Han Li to cultivate the Evergreen Arts to the third layer according to schedule. Han Zhen had been stuck at Qi Condensation Layer Three for some time and was already impatient. Han Zhen now had a complete understanding of his own strength; after exchanging blows with the three Grandmasters, he was invincible below the Martial Grandmaster realm! However, Doctor Mo had once dominated both the light and dark sides of Lan Prefecture, living by the rule "those who comply survive, those who defy perish." Even if he wasn't a Grandmaster, he wasn't far off. Moreover, his arsenal of poisons and cunning tricks had to be guarded against. Therefore, Han Zhen still needed to prepare thoroughly, ensuring a one-hit kill and giving Doctor Mo no chance to employ his schemes.

With no one to bother him, Han Zhen finally enjoyed some peace and quiet. On this day, he was inventorying the gifts he had received. Among them, a hundred-year-old Polygonatum Sibiricum (Yellow Essence Ganoderma) caught Han Zhen's attention. Han Zhen vaguely remembered this as the main ingredient for a spiritual elixir; a pill refined from a plant over a hundred years old could even aid cultivators in the late stages of Qi Condensation to increase their magical power. As for thousand-year-old Polygonatum Sibiricum, it was a top-tier spiritual medicine, rarely seen in the cultivation world, appearing only at auctions where Foundation Establishment cultivators would frantically bid for it. It would be impossible to obtain without several thousand spirit stones.

Han Zhen checked the gift list; this hundred-year-old Polygonatum Sibiricum actually came from Vice Sect Master Ma. This made Han Zhen sigh with a few words, confirming that he was indeed an old fox. Vice Sect Master Ma was Wu Yan's cousin's husband, the first "big shot" Han Zhen had met in this world, and his attitude towards Han Zhen was not exactly friendly. Therefore, Han Zhen had a deep impression of Vice Sect Master Ma. This time, Wu Yan had followed Han Zhen's team down the mountain for training, and this disaster was also aimed at Han Zhen. If Vice Sect Master Ma had truly used this as an excuse to cause trouble, he would have been justified, but now Han Zhen's reasoning carried more weight. Putting aside his Qi Condensation Layer Three cultivation, in terms of mortal martial arts prowess, Han Zhen, going all out, could exhaust any one of the Grand Martial Uncles to death. Only if all three opponents joined forces would Han Zhen be defeated. Han Zhen smiled, carefully put away the hundred-year-old Polygonatum Sibiricum to prevent its medicinal properties from dissipating.

Arriving in the newly excavated training room, he finally had time to properly study the arrowhead he had previously obtained. This might become a winning weapon against Doctor Mo. Han Zhen took out the arrowhead from a small leather pouch similar to the one Han Li used to hide his small green bottle. This pouch was specially sewn by Han Li's mother from animal hide and contained a peace talisman made from boar tusks. When she learned that Han Zhen would also be going with them to participate in the Seven Mysteries Sect's entrance examination, she had prepared two such pouches, hoping they would bless them with safety and freedom from disaster. Han Zhen first clamped the arrowhead between two fingers, and smoothly, without any obstruction, injected a small amount of True Qi through his fingertips into the arrowhead.

With a flick of his wrist, the arrowhead shot out like a dart, burying more than half its length into the stone wall, causing some spiderweb-like cracks to appear around it. He then switched to a common fine steel arrowhead and found that under the same True Qi conditions, the damage caused was almost identical. Indeed, True Qi had no propulsive effect on the arrowhead. He dug out both arrowheads. This time, Han Zhen circulated the Evergreen Arts, using his consciousness to extend and inject magical power into the arrowhead. Unlike when using True Qi, Han Zhen immediately felt a connection establish with the arrowhead. A faint green spiritual glow emanated from the arrowhead, but unfortunately, Han Zhen did not know how to control its movement. Indeed, lacking the other half of the magic tool, this arrowhead was like a dead object.

Han Zhen persistently made various attempts, finally choosing to increase the magical power injected into the arrowhead. As if reaching a critical threshold, the green light on the arrowhead instantly became dazzling, shooting out from his hand. Han Zhen felt his connection with the arrowhead immediately sever. A smooth hole appeared in the one-zhang-thick stone wall in front of where the arrowhead had shot out. Han Zhen quickly chased after it, but the small arrowhead was already nowhere to be found. Fortunately, the arrowhead had shot out towards the outside of the mountain. Han Zhen searched along the trajectory of its flight, finally sensing the arrowhead with his residual spiritual energy aura. At a spot seven hundred paces down the mountain, he found the small arrowhead fallen in the forest, likely having lost momentum after its injected spiritual energy was depleted.

"Perhaps it can become the trump card that determines victory or defeat!" Han Zhen carefully placed the arrowhead back into the animal skin pouch, then hung it around his neck. Compared to the explosive destructive power of True Qi, the terrifying penetrative effect of spiritual energy injected into the arrowhead made Han Zhen feel even more awed. It also served as a warning to Han Zhen: never try to resist a cultivator's attack with any mortal means!
