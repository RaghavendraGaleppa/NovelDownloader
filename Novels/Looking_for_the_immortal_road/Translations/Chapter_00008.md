# Chapter 8: Immortal-Slaying Flying Knife

Although Zhao Di had been cultivating for ten years, he had never encountered a demonic beast. Naturally, he found these legendary creatures both novel and frightening. Moreover, he had no combat experience whatsoever. After much deliberation, he decided to take a safer mountain path. Although it would take several extra days, it was better than foolishly losing his life right after setting out.

While cultivators possessed far greater physical stamina than mortals, Zhao Di, at only the fourth level of Qi Condensation, was still extremely tired after a day of traveling through the mountains. He felt it was time to eat something, rest comfortably for the night, and resume his journey at dawn. When Zhao Di left the Jian family, he hadn't brought any waterskins, canteens, or dry food, as solving basic needs like eating and drinking was no challenge for a cultivator. In fact, upon reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, nourished by potent spiritual energy, cultivators' bodies transformed completely from mortals, allowing them to achieve "Bigu"—the state of complete abstinence from food and drink, sustaining themselves solely by absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

Zhao Di now spread his full attention outwards. With his powerful divine sense, he could monitor every movement within a radius of over ten zhang—from the sound of an earthworm burrowing into the soil, to the faint fragrance emanating from a blade of grass, or even the tiny pollen grains clinging to a bee's hairs as it flew past a flower patch. All of this appeared clearly in Zhao Di's mind. This sensation of seemingly controlling everything around him was something Zhao Di thoroughly enjoyed. If the distance was slightly greater, his senses wouldn't be as keen, but he still noticed a wild rabbit nibbling on tender grass several tens of zhang away.

"Stealth Art," Zhao Di muttered, casting this basic low-tier spell upon himself. A beam of spiritual light enveloped his body, and after a few flickers, Zhao Di completely vanished into the mountain forest. Of course, this low-tier concealment spell was only effective against mortals. If there were other cultivators nearby, they could easily see Zhao Di's every move by using the equally low-tier "Spirit Eye Art."

After casting the Stealth Art, Zhao Di easily approached within two or three zhang of the grey-furred wild rabbit without disturbing it. Then, a small fireball spell struck about two chi from the rabbit. After a fiery explosion, a small crater about half a chi deep was left on the ground, and the rabbit, completely unaware of what had happened and still intently nibbling on grass stems, was instantly killed by the shockwave of the explosion.

"The power of that mini-fireball spell was perfectly calculated. Any stronger and this delicious meal would have been scorched," Zhao Di remarked to himself, picking up the wild rabbit from the ground. At the same time, he thought: "I still need to spend more time practicing with magical artifacts. It would be much easier to hunt wild beasts with them. Moreover, the books all say that the cultivation world operates on the law of the jungle and is even more dangerous than the mortal world. It's good to have more ways to protect myself."

He used a small fireball to excavate a shallow pit, wrapped the rabbit in leaves, placed it in the pit, covered it with a layer of soil, and then piled seven or eight arm-thick branches on top. With a soft "whoosh," a soybean-sized flame gathered on his finger. He lightly flicked it onto the branches, and they immediately burst into fierce flames. In a short while, all seven or eight branches were reduced to ash.

"This flame formed by spiritual energy is truly bizarre; it's so powerful it's a bit hard to control. The soil is also very hot now. Slowly, in about half an hour, the rabbit should be braised perfectly. Perhaps I should use this opportunity to practice manipulating my artifact." From his beast-skin pouch, he took out a flying knife-shaped artifact. Its blade was about three inches long and one inch wide, with a short hilt, making the entire knife palm-sized. It emanated a faint blue glow. This small knife was a low-grade artifact, yet Zhao Di had given it an exceptionally mighty name: the Immortal-Slaying Flying Knife. It was a gift from his family when he reached the fourth level of Qi Condensation, and it was currently his only artifact.

Zhao Di slowly channeled spiritual energy from his palm into the flying knife, simultaneously enveloping the entire blade with his divine sense. The small knife hummed, then leaped into the air. Manipulating an artifact was known as Art of Control, a common method for cultivators to control objects remotely. Besides channeling spiritual energy into the artifact to establish a connection with the cultivator, divine sense and intention were also required to control its every movement.

"Go!" Zhao Di commanded aloud, simultaneously picturing the small knife flying forward to strike in his mind. Sure enough, the Immortal-Slaying Flying Knife shot forward with a streak of blue light at incredible speed, reaching five or six zhang away in the blink of an eye.

"Return!" Zhao Di gave the flying knife another "instruction" in his mind. At this point, the small knife seemed somewhat reluctant, trembling a few times before slowly turning back and flying to Zhao Di's front. "It seems I can only control this flying knife within about three or four zhang of myself. Beyond that range, it's difficult to manipulate skillfully," Zhao Di thought. Since acquiring this artifact, he had practiced the Art of Control seven or eight times, and now he could finally manage to control it somewhat proficiently within close proximity. He practiced several more rounds, both testing how far the small knife could fly before he lost control and practicing agile close-range manipulation. About half an hour later, a fragrant aroma wafted from the earth, and Zhao Di stopped his practice.

He was full after eating two rabbit legs. He casually found a banana leaf over a chi wide and cast the "Rain Transformation Art." Instantly, countless tiny water droplets condensed in the air above his palm, turning into a fine drizzle that slowly fell onto the banana leaf. Before long, the leaf was filled. "So sweet!" Zhao Di took several large, satisfying gulps. With a content expression, he leaped onto a branch of a nearby large pine tree, using both hands and feet to easily climb high up in just a few movements, choosing a comfortable spot for his night's rest.

Perhaps he was truly tired, as he quickly fell into a deep sleep. In his dreams, he was sometimes in his previous life, immersed in reading scriptures; other times, he was learning spells with a group of children, the various splendid and mighty spiritual lights dazzling him and filling him with longing; then he would return to his "childhood," with Jian Xin'er following him like a tail every day, constantly urging him to tell stories...

A beast's howl, echoing through the mountain forest, startled Zhao Di awake from his dream. Zhao Di immediately sat up and looked in the direction of the sound. Illuminated by the moonlight, he could only vaguely discern a large, black-and-white striped beast in the distance, slowly but steadily approaching his location. Zhao Di channeled spiritual energy into his eyes and observed the beast carefully with his Spirit Eye Art for a while, confirming that it was just an ordinary wild animal, completely devoid of spiritual energy.

Secretly relieved, Zhao Di simply waited patiently in the tree for the beast to approach. If he hadn't guessed wrong, the scent of the half-eaten roasted wild rabbit had probably attracted it. When the beast was two or three hundred zhang away from Zhao Di, illuminated by the faint moonlight filtering through the trees, Zhao Di finally got a clear look at its appearance and couldn't help but take a sharp breath. The beast was over a zhang long, with pure white fur marked by black stripes, strikingly resembling the fabled rare animal—a white tiger.

"What a find!" Zhao Di's hunting instinct was piqued. In his mind, white tigers held special significance; legends claimed that those who encountered and hunted a white tiger were destined to become great heroes. To have such a good omen on just his first day of venturing out for experience, did this portend good fortune ahead? It was precisely because Zhao Di was a cultivator that he dared to think this way. If an ordinary mortal had seen this beast, they would likely have been paralyzed with fear, far from considering it a good omen.

This unlucky white tiger had clearly not yet noticed Zhao Di's presence, still striding step by step towards the spot emanating the rich scent of roasted meat. Suddenly, a small, several-inch-long knife enveloped in a blue light shot out from the pine tree, heading straight for the white tiger, reaching its side in an instant. Although the white tiger was massive, its movements were incredibly agile. With a single forward leap, it dodged the blue light, simultaneously sweeping its long tail to strike the blue light. That steel-like long tail struck with such force that it could probably snap even palm-thick trees in half.

However, the blue light was completely unaffected, severing the tiger's tail in two. It then immediately changed direction and darted towards the tiger's belly. Its speed left the tiger no chance to dodge. With a pained howl from the white tiger, the blue light sliced a large gash beneath its body from head to tail. It then collapsed, dead, with its blood and internal organs spilling onto the ground.

The "Immortal-Slaying Flying Knife" achieved a triumphant victory in its first actual combat, then was gleefully recalled by Zhao Di. Zhao Di paused briefly, then re-summoned the flying knife, carefully controlling it to meticulously skin the entire white tiger, piece by piece. Such precise control was extremely taxing on his divine sense. By the time the entire tiger hide was removed, Zhao Di felt a dull ache in his head, clearly a result of overusing his divine sense. He put away the Immortal-Slaying Flying Knife, not bothering to tidy the tiger hide, and returned to the pine tree to fall soundly asleep.
