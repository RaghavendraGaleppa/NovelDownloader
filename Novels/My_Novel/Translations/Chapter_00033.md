Chapter 33: Youthful Heroism, the Younger Brother Seeks the Manor

The warmth flowing through the Dantian is referred to by martial artists as "Nei Jin," "Nei Qi," or "Nei Qi."

It is a substance that martial artists, through the tempering of their martial arts, generate from deep within their flesh and blood.

When applied to martial techniques, it can trigger qualitative changes.

With Qi to protect the body, it can also ward off severe cold, resist external evils, boost energy, and has many other wondrous effects. Li Xian is still in the initial stages of the Dao of Martial Arts and is still exploring these.

Li Xian circulated his internal energy, supplementing it with the perfected "Four Directions Fist." As he threw a punch, the martial intent was incredibly rich.

It actually had a meaning of returning to simplicity and truth.

"Li... Lord Li?"

Suddenly, a man walked toward him, nodding and bowing, his face filled with a fawning, flattering expression.

This man was named Shi Xiaodong, an ordinary Class D Guard. Just in terms of age, this man was twenty-five, while Li Xian was only fifteen.

Yet now, he hunched his waist, wore an ingratiating smile, and his attitude was humble and respectful. He took the initiative to address Li Xian as "Lord."

"What is it?"

Li Xian retracted his stance. Today's hard practice had yielded results; the Four Directions Fist had successfully reached perfection, and the proficiency of the Clear Breeze Legs had increased by over 40 points. He was just about to rest.

"I heard that... you've become a Class C Guard?" Shi Xiaodong asked with a smile.

Li Xian nodded. Shi Xiaodong immediately clasped his hands in congratulations: "Congratulations, Lord Li, felicitations, Lord Li, this is truly remarkable. Everyone has been talking about you these past two days, saying you are handsome and valiant, elegant and extraordinary..."

After a great deal of praise, he finally got to the main point.

"It's like this, I have a small favor I'd like to ask for your help with."

"Let's hear it." Li Xian bent down to pick up the sheathed sword on the ground and tightened his wrist guards. Though young, he already possessed an extraordinary aura.

His appearance was handsome and refined.

He didn't look like a servant guard at all, but more like a heroic youth, full of spirit and ambition, dressed in fine clothes and riding a spirited horse.

Shi Xiaodong was momentarily dazzled. Such a heroic youth, he had not never seen them. The manor often had external guests, among whom were no shortage of young masters from distinguished backgrounds.

To them, these were all figures as transcendent as immortals. These figures carried this very spirit of heroic ambition.

But to see it in a guard was truly the first time.

To speak of Class C Guards, although their rank is already quite high, there are many, and indeed many, who are higher. But this thing called temperament is truly mysterious; it comes from the heart. Either one has it, or one doesn't. It cannot be learned.

"You haven't purchased any pills this month, have you?" Shi Xiaodong rubbed his hands together. "I would like to ask a favor, to have you help me purchase a 'Class C Pill'."

Li Xian understood. He rubbed his sore shoulders and stretched his entire body's bones and joints. This was a small detail for maintaining the meridians.

It helped the flow of blood and energy, and unblocked and softened the blood vessels.

"Tell me the details."

Li Xian exhaled a breath and said as he walked. He had a patrol duty coming up soon.

"Hehe, young master here, I've taken a liking to a 'Jade Jade Pill'. I've saved up my earnings for half a year."

"If you agree, Lord Li, please help me buy it from the Leisure Pill Pavilion. Rest assured, I understand the rules. Apart from the cost of the pill, everything else in here is for you."

Shi Xiaodong smiled and took out a pouch, presenting it with both hands.

Li Xian did not take it, but instead asked, "Jade Jade Pill?"

"The Jade Jade Pill costs one tael and seven hundred copper coins at the Leisure Pill Pavilion. Its effect is to enhance internal energy. My martial arts have not progressed for a long time, so I thought of using a pill to take another step up."

Shi Xiaodong said with an ingratiating smile, not daring to hide anything.

"This is the first time I've heard of this pill," Li Xian said. He was short on money at the moment, so helping with this small favor was no big deal.

He took the money bag and weighed it. It was full of broken silver and copper coins, making a clinking sound. He opened it and took a look, estimating roughly.

The broken silver and copper coins inside combined were worth about two taels. This Shi Xiaodong knew how to handle things well.

"Alright, let's go now," Li Xian said.

"Right... right now?" Shi Xiaodong was stunned, a look of surprise on his face. But then, a trace of worry flashed through his eyes.

He followed along the way, watching Li Xian enter the Leisure Pill Pavilion. Shi Xiaodong paced outside the door, muttering to himself:

"This Lord Li is truly straightforward, saying he'll help and doing it immediately."

"But what if he gets malicious intentions and wants to embezzle my money, what then?"

He couldn't help but think this way.

Generally speaking, when a Class D Guard asks a Class C Guard to purchase pills, there are many rules and hidden meanings involved.

Usually, it's ordered in the first few days of the month.

But the Class C Guard won't buy it immediately, because they aren't sure if they will need to use a pill that month.

They will drag it out until the end of the month, only going to buy the pill for the Class D Guard after confirming they don't need it themselves.

And this is the best-case scenario.

Once a person has power, they will find ways to make things difficult for those without power, just to feel that power.

This is especially true when purchasing pills.

"Could it be... that he's already swallowed my savings of over half a year?"

"Oh no, what do I do? What do I do?"

Shi Xiaodong was so anxious he was spinning in circles, almost about to cry.

This kind of thing wasn't uncommon. After all, he was asking for a favor, so if he had grievances, he could only swallow them.

If the Class C Guard really wanted to embezzle the money... this money could only be considered a gift, lost and gone.

After all, if a conflict arose, the loss would be even greater.

"I should have gone to find that Yan Yang. He's an old Class C Guard, even though his price is high and he often delays delivering the pills for months."

"At least... there has never been a case of him swallowing the pills."

"Shi Xiaodong, oh Shi Xiaodong, you just had to be clever, and now you've suffered a big loss."

Shi Xiaodong's eyes were red, he was truly about to cry, feeling stifled in his heart.

"Here."

Before long, Li Xian walked out of the building and tossed a brocade box over.

Shi Xiaodong was stunned.

He hurriedly caught the brocade box, looking at Li Xian with an expression of disbelief.

"What, you asked me to buy you a pill, and now you have this kind of look on your face?" Li Xian frowned.

"Ah... oh, oh." Shi Xiaodong hurriedly opened the brocade box.

A wave of pill fragrance wafted out. Inside lay a light green pill, exactly the Jade Jade Pill. Its quality, shape, and fragrance were all excellent.

"The transaction is complete. The remaining three hundred and ninety copper coins are all mine," Li Xian said, rubbing his nose.

He felt a little embarrassed.

Just by going back and forth, he had earned two months of someone's salary. Even for a Class D Guard, there are many ways to make extra money on the side to increase their income.

But three hundred and ninety copper coins is a genuine amount. In these times, it's enough to buy a life!

"If there's nothing else, I'll be going."

With a wave of his hand, Li Xian left潇洒ly (with an elegant, carefree air).

"This..."

Shi Xiaodong stared dumbfounded at Li Xian's retreating figure.

Same day payment, same day delivery of the pill.

No idle talk, no bullying, no trickery, no acting tough... In his five or six years at the manor, he had never heard of such a thing, nor had he ever seen it. This was a first.

Vaguely, he seemed to understand a little how this youthful heroic spirit came to be.

"Lord Li... you are a true master." Shi Xiaodong gave a thumbs up, sincerely won over.

Previously, among the gossip about Li Xian, there was no lack of his voice. Thinking back on it now, he felt so ashamed he wished he could find a hole to hide in.

The cold wind howled.

It seemed to want to flay the flesh from one's bones, leaving no one to live.

Li Xiaofan's winter examination was imminent. He was about to travel with the examination group to the neighboring "Huangtian County" to formally begin the winter exam.

The Great Wu Empire... valued both martial arts and literature. Martial artists pursued rebirth and transformation, while scholars used literary energy to seize fortune.

Those who carried fortune were highly revered.

The so-called scholarly examination was a test to seize fortune.

Li Xiaofan was very obedient to his older brother. He took the money to eat some nourishing meat, and his nutrition improved a bit.

He was about to leave Qingning County, and he really wanted to see his older brother one more time.

Braving the cold wind, wearing dirty and smelly hemp clothes, his small face was filled with determination.

His snot was frozen stiff, sticking to his face. If he tried to pull it off, it would surely hurt.

He saw a manor in the distance.

"Is this the manor where my older brother lives?" Li Xiaofan thought silently in his heart: "I hope I can see my older brother."
