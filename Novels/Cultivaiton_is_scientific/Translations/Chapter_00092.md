# Chapter 92: Plans

The sea pork was delicious. Apart from the spiritual fish he'd eaten over the past two months, this was only the second time in a year that Li Shiming had tasted spiritual meat.

He ate with great relish, consuming two jin of the spiritual pork in one meal. However, when he practiced the "Diamond Body Protection Technique" afterward, he discovered that despite eating a large amount of sea pork, its cultivation effect paled in comparison to spiritual fish—it wasn't even as effective as the spiritual herbs recorded in the technique manual. This highlighted the extraordinary nature of spiritual fish.

Still, the sea pork satisfied his culinary cravings. Since he dared not waste spiritual fish by overindulging, the sea pork, though less valuable, could be eaten freely.

Through conversations with Qiu Tan, he learned that sea beasts were rarely seen in the sect's waters because the sect had established a defensive line at the passage to the open sea. Many sect disciples skilled in combat were stationed there, hunting sea beasts as their primary target.

In the "Sea Beast Atlas," the sea pig—a low-level, first-tier sea beast—was among the weakest of its kind. First-tier sea beasts were roughly equivalent to human cultivators at the Qi Refinement stage, though this comparison wasn't absolute. A sea beast's strength depended on its bloodline and innate abilities. 

For example, the sea pig Li Shiming encountered had spiritual energy equivalent to the third layer of Qi Refinement, but its offensive capabilities were limited to physical charges and a basic Water Spirit Shield for defense. In actual combat, a third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator with sufficient talismans and flight techniques could easily defeat it.

Sea beasts had clear advantages in their natural habitat. If a battle at sea didn't result in an instant kill, a wounded sea beast could escape into the water, leaving land-bound cultivators helpless. Even the sea pig's Water Spirit Shield allowed it a high chance of survival if it reached the water after being injured.

In the open sea, human cultivators typically hunted sea beasts in teams. Many sea beasts could overpower cultivators of the same level with their formidable physiques, making one-on-one combat extremely dangerous.

Reading the "Sea Beast Atlas," Li Shiming's eyes lit up with an idea. Once he reached the mid-stage of Qi Refinement and refined a mid-grade defensive formation, he could venture into the open sea to hunt sea beasts. With his bronze corpse (a seventh-layer Qi Refinement combatant) and weapons like white phosphorus and thermite bombs, he could hunt sea beasts alone without needing a team.

The atlas also noted that some sea beasts formed inner cores, valuable materials for crafting cultivation-enhancing pills. The prospect of earning spirit stones while using core-derived pills to boost his strength seemed ideal.

Of course, Li Shiming knew this was still a distant goal. For now, he needed to focus on diligent cultivation.

Over the next six months, with no spiritual rice to cultivate, he found himself with more free time. The unique climate of the Tianhai region made spiritual rice farming impossible. Just ten days after his harvest, moist winds from the open sea brought continuous cloud cover, blocking sunlight for entire days. Rain became frequent, falling unpredictably at any time.

Under these conditions, spiritual rice—which required strong photosynthesis, flood resistance, and consistent spiritual rain—would yield far less than the effort invested. Li Shiming estimated that farming under such weather would result in heavy losses.

There were potential solutions. His ongoing genetic modification research aimed to address these challenges. Alternatively, a transparent glass greenhouse with artificial lighting and proper drainage could enable spiritual rice cultivation despite the weather. However, this would require developing an entirely new farming methodology.

Cultivators capable of such innovations wouldn't bother with the modest profits of spiritual rice, while ordinary spiritual farmers lacked the necessary skills. Implementing glass greenhouses, lighting, drainage, and new farming techniques would require extensive array formations—a prohibitively expensive endeavor if scaled across all sect-owned fields.

Moreover, artificial cultivation methods were frowned upon by traditional spiritual farmers, who preferred enhancing their techniques to boost yields. A mid-level spiritual farmer could easily double or triple rice production through refined methods. With such solutions available, why would anyone consider unconventional approaches?

Li Shiming had no plans to build greenhouses or reveal his genetically modified rice anytime soon. Only when he had sufficient strength to protect himself from unwanted attention would he consider sharing his findings. (Personally, he wouldn't eat GM rice—a principle he stood by—but he doubted it would affect cultivators.)

"Looks like I'll have to visit Changming Island," Li Shiming sighed one day, realizing he lacked many essentials: talisman ink materials, spiritual seeds, and certain knowledge—all requiring sect contribution points. He was grateful he'd chosen the expensive "Sword Control Art" early on; otherwise, earning enough points for it could have taken a decade.

With 2,000 jin of spiritual rice to sell and over 2,000 spirit stones, he should have enough for his needs.

Changming Island's market operated on daily, monthly, and annual schedules. The daily market had fixed vendors open every day, while the monthly market attracted larger crowds, and the annual market even hosted Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Li Shiming set out at 4 a.m., as his paper crane's slow speed meant a four-hour journey. According to Qiu Tan, the daily market was busiest in the morning—vendors, being cultivators themselves, usually closed in the afternoon to focus on cultivation. Since he wasn't buying rare items, the daily market sufficed.

Flying on the paper crane through damp, overcast skies was far from the transcendent experience he'd imagined. The journey was uncomfortable, with no shelter from the elements.
