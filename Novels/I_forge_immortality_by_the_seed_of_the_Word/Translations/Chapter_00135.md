# Chapter 133: Within the Flowing Light Immortal Wall  

"After all, Senior Brother You possesses a Golden Dao Foundation!" Yang Bai couldn't help but sigh after hearing Junior Brother Qiu's words.  

The mention of Golden Dao Foundations inevitably made him think of Zhang Jing and the extraordinary phenomena during his breakthrough a month ago. Curiosity got the better of him as he asked, "Junior Brother Qiu, if Zhang Jing were to challenge the True Spirit Ranking now, how far do you think he'd go?"  

"That's hard to say," Qiu Xiuming replied with a wry smile. "Although Zhang Jing has established a Golden Dao Foundation, his cultivation is still too low—only at the early Foundation Establishment stage. Meanwhile, everyone on the True Spirit Ranking is a genius at the peak of late Foundation Establishment. The gap is simply too vast."  

"So you think Zhang Jing won't make it onto the True Spirit Ranking anytime soon?" Yang Bai asked with a chuckle.  

"If Zhang Jing reaches mid-Foundation Establishment, he'll definitely enter the True Spirit Ranking," Qiu Xiuming said after a moment of contemplation.  

"Haha, we're of the same mind, Junior Brother!" Yang Bai nodded in agreement before sighing again. "For a preparatory chief disciple to rank on the True Spirit Ranking at mid-Foundation Establishment—what a blessing for our Thousand Techniques Pavilion. Thankfully, I was decisive back then. Otherwise, Zhang Jing would be in the Inheritance Pavilion now."  

Qiu Xiuming rolled his eyes. He had heard this boast so many times his ears were practically calloused.  

Just then, the light in the hall dimmed abruptly.  

Six indistinct figures materialized silently before the assembled disciples. The hall fell into complete silence.  

A moment later, the dozen or so inner disciples in the hall bowed respectfully and chorused, "We greet the Academy Master and the Pavilion Masters!"  

"No need for formalities. Carry on as usual—pay us no mind," the Academy Master said warmly, his voice brimming with unmistakable delight and even a trace of anticipation.  

"Senior Brother Yang, it seems the Academy Master and the Pavilion Masters are also looking forward to Senior Brother You's ranking," Qiu Xiuming transmitted excitedly.  

"Of course. Senior Brother You is currently the undisputed chief disciple of our Dragon Lake Dao Academy. It's only natural for the Academy Master and Pavilion Masters to be concerned about his True Spirit Ranking," Yang Bai replied.  

Half an hour later, as everyone remained fixated on the Flowing Light Immortal Wall, awaiting the results, a figure slowly entered the hall.  

Qiu Xiuming glanced over absentmindedly, then froze for a moment before breaking into an intrigued smile.  

"Senior Brother Yang, guess who just arrived?"  

Yang Bai turned to look and immediately mirrored Qiu Xiuming's expression.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing? Tsk, both Golden Dao Foundation talents of our academy are gathered here today! Now we don't have to speculate about how far he'll go—we can see for ourselves. By the way, did you bring a Shadow Retaining Talisman?"  

"What for?"  

"A scene like this won't happen again. We should record it."  

Meanwhile, as Zhang Jing approached, the Academy Master greeted him with a chuckle, "Zhang Jing, you've finally arrived. We've all been waiting to see your performance today."  

"Zhang Jing, it's good you're here."  

"Tsk, in just over a month, your aura has grown even more unfathomable."  

The other five Pavilion Masters also exchanged pleasantries with Zhang Jing, their tones remarkably cordial.  

Though there was still a gap in cultivation, their attitudes made it clear they regarded Zhang Jing as their peer.  

"Zhang Jing greets the Academy Master and Pavilion Masters. I'll do my best, though I fear I may disappoint," Zhang Jing replied modestly.  

After the brief exchange, he strode decisively into the Flowing Light Immortal Wall without hesitation.  

In a corner of the hall, Qiu Xiuming and Yang Bai exchanged bewildered glances.  

Why did it seem the Academy Master and Pavilion Masters weren't here for Senior Brother You, but specifically for Zhang Jing?  

How strange!  

With a flash of white light, Zhang Jing found himself in a familiar space.  

Before him stood the massive True Spirit Ranking, and beneath it, two solitary bronze doors—one to the left, one to the right. The doors were modest in size, roughly nine feet tall and five feet wide.  

As his gaze swept over them, the seal script inscriptions on the doors glowed faintly.  

"Spiritual Enlightenment Realm tests comprehension of Dao Intent, while the Miraculous Techniques Immortal Realm evaluates combat and protective abilities. The combined results determine the ranking. Interesting."  

After a brief consideration, Zhang Jing stepped toward the Spiritual Enlightenment Realm door.  

With a creak, the thousand-jin bronze door slowly swung open.  

Zhang Jing stepped through and vanished.  

Inside, his vision revealed a cobblestone path that defied logic, stretching straight toward the horizon. Below was a bottomless abyss, dark and boundless, howling with sinister winds.  

"Walk forward without relying on cultivation? A thousand zhang signifies perfect Dao Intent comprehension. But what lies beyond?" Zhang Jing mused, recalling the door's description.  

He tested his senses and confirmed he had no access to his cultivation.  

Without hesitation, Zhang Jing strode forward, hands clasped behind his back.  

The abyss below exerted a powerful pull, as if trying to drag him down, while the winds intensified with each step, threatening to destabilize him.  

A thought stirred in his mind. His Dao Foundation within the Mud Pill Palace trembled slightly, and the Primordial Beginning True Intent instantly unfurled, shielding him from the abyss's pull and the raging winds.  

His steps lightened, and his pace quickened.  

This form of trial posed no challenge to someone wielding the Primordial Beginning True Intent.  

Half an hour later, Zhang Jing emerged from the Spiritual Enlightenment Realm.  

After a brief rest, he entered the Miraculous Techniques Immortal Realm through the other bronze door.  

Meanwhile, on the door to the Spiritual Enlightenment Realm, a line of small characters faded away:  

**[Zhang Jing (Dragon Lake Dao Academy): 1,999 zhang]**  

In a flash, Zhang Jing found himself on a dueling platform. His sealed cultivation had now fully returned.  

"Zhang Jing, begin the challenge?" a dispassionate voice intoned.  

"Yes," Zhang Jing affirmed.  

Instantly, a figure materialized before him—expressionless, clad in the robes of an inner disciple from the Radiant Light Dao Academy.  

Zhang Jing recognized him—someone he had encountered not long ago in the Myriad Gods Minor Heaven.  

"I wonder how closely these battle phantoms mimic their originals?" Zhang Jing mused, recalling similar constructs like the guardian spirits in the Myriad Gods Minor Heaven.  

The phantom opposite him began gathering mana furiously.  

"No matter. Let's end this quickly."  

Zhang Jing's eyes flashed as he activated the **Lunar Python Devouring Qi Dao Seed**.  

A bestial, savage roar shook the platform.
