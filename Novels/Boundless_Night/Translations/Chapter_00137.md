Chapter 137: One More Option

In the thick night fog, the silver firelight extinguished, leaving only Qin Ming's fist, surging with a sun-like Heavenly Light Energy, pressed close to his opponent's forehead. Yu Zhuohan lay motionless on the ground, completely unconscious.

From a distance, Cui He and Cui Shuning's emotions surged violently, their chests tight with a suffocating feeling. The worst had happened. The strength of the one impersonating Cui Chonghe far exceeded their expectations. If he were a disciple of the Cui family, they would have burst into cheers—he was undoubtedly an astonishing young prodigy! However, a massive, unbridgeable rift now existed between them and Qin Ming, making any improvement in their relationship impossible. Most critically, if the fake Cui Chonghe continued to grow at this rate, they, let alone others, felt they wouldn't be able to sleep soundly.

The wilderness fell silent, a storm brewing in the hearts of the younger generation, truly stunned. Instantly, a cacophony of voices erupted from their area as they began to discuss animatedly.

"Wake up!" Qin Ming tugged at Yu Zhuohan. Why had he fainted? Qin Ming had wanted to resonate with him while his emotions were at their peak. Qin Ming realized that his unified Heavenly Light Energy was harmful and oppressive to the Esoteric Cult's "Spiritual Wisdom," so he had to retract his fist's radiance. He prepared to search Yu Zhuohan for spoils.

Suddenly, a warning sign flashed in his mind, and his hairs stood on end. He didn't know when, but two figures had appeared nearby, silently observing. One of them was Meng Xinghai, which made him sigh in relief. The other figure was shrouded in a black robe, making it impossible to discern their gender, but it was clear they cared deeply for Yu Zhuohan. The two had appeared here likely fearing he might strike a fatal blow, blasting Yu Zhuohan with a single punch.

Qin Ming naturally wouldn't do that; he didn't want to make enemies without reason. The silver-haired youth had once defied Cui Shuning, saying he would use the confrontation to temper himself. It was evident that this youth did not take orders from the Cui family. Qin Ming believed that if he killed Yu Zhuohan, Cui He and Cui Shuning would be pleased. After all, the silver-haired youth was likely of no small origin; his strength was quite extraordinary, an innate ability user, and the Esoteric Cult should be very fond of such new talents.

Qin Ming had already extended his hand, wanting to "pick up treasures" from Yu Zhuohan's person. He didn't mind Meng Xinghai watching, but the black-robed figure was also staring at his hand. He felt awkward but still polite, managing a laugh to himself. "Brother, the ground is covered in dew. You should get up quickly. I didn't hit you hard."

With his outstretched hand, Qin Ming naturally couldn't search for loot. Instead, he simply shook the silver-haired youth's shoulder, trying to wake him.

The black-robed figure spoke, "We are all members of the Esoteric Cult. What happened to our promised amity? This junior of yours didn't hold back at all. That fist light, like a blazing sun, would surely have burned through the Spiritual Wisdom of any ordinary Esoteric Cult disciple."

Meng Xinghai shook his head, saying, "It's his first time fighting an Esoteric Cult disciple. He doesn't understand the methods of our path, so he didn't control the intensity well."

From afar, Cui He and Cui Shuning heard this exchange, and their minds nearly collapsed! It turned out that Meng Xinghai had already known about the young expert they had found from the Esoteric Cult; the two not only knew each other but seemed to have some existing friendly ties.

Yu Zhuohan awoke and immediately saw his opponent, the one with the powerful aura who had brought him boundless pressure, smiling brilliantly at him. His heart immediately tightened. Such a dangerous individual, so close! If that terrifying Heavenly Light Energy were to erupt, his accumulated Spiritual Wisdom would surely burst apart.

"Don't be scared. Please don't faint again," Qin Ming quickly reassured him.

The black-robed figure walked over and said, "Get up."

Yu Zhuohan's face flushed slightly, and he quickly said, "I didn't faint from fear! I fainted because that sun-like fist light scorched my Spiritual Wisdom, causing injuries!"

Qin Ming watched with great regret as the silver-haired youth strapped his Crimson Jade Iron Sword back onto his back. Yu Zhuohan watched him warily, always feeling that something was off about the gaze of this youth who had once been as imposing as a mountain.

With that, the duel came to an end.

Some rejoiced, others worried; the moods of the onlookers in the wilderness varied. Among the group of young people, the atmosphere was most lively; they were all stunned by the strength of their old acquaintance. No one had expected him to rise so rapidly. Two years ago, many knew that something had happened to him. Without incident, his life trajectory would have completely changed, and he would never have returned to their sight.

And it should have been so. From what they understood, he had embarked on the New Life Path less than half a year ago. Starting so late, and without good cultivation techniques, how could he possibly catch up? Yet, he was truly unbelievable. After falling from grace, he had remained silent for over two years, and now, news came that he was already an Extraordinary Individual.

Cold qi rose from Zheng Maorong's tailbone upwards. He had thought that this old acquaintance, who had fallen into the dust, could be easily suppressed or even killed in a remote area with a simple hint to someone. But now, he was formidable to such an extent. A strong sense of unease filled his heart!

Beside him, some acquaintances were already making arrangements to invite Qin Ming to a small gathering back in Crimson Glow City. "I knew it," someone said with a smile, "even if he suffered a great change, he would eventually recover!" How much truth and how much falsehood lay in those words was hard to tell. However, some genuinely rejoiced for Qin Ming. In the past, pressured by circumstances, they hadn't dared to visit him in Crimson Glow City. Now, seeing him struggle out of the "mire" on his own, gain Meng Xinghai's appreciation, and earn the regard of the Li family's venerable elder, they all secretly breathed a sigh of relief for him.

"Heh heh..." someone from the Li family's direct lineage chuckled, completely disregarding the gloomy expressions of Cui He and Cui Shuning. Relatively speaking, what was it if Qin Ming had kicked Li Qingxiao's backside twice? Now, every time Qin Ming had a "moment of glory," it was equivalent to humiliating Cui He, Cui Shuning, and the others, making them vexed and stifled with frustration. As rivals, the Li family's direct descendants were naturally pleased.

However, when they remembered that Li Qingxu had almost killed Qin Ming back then, they all frowned, thinking that it had truly been a "botched" outcome. Either don't make a move, or kill him directly to avoid leaving trouble behind. So, gradually, the Li family members also stopped smiling. Only Qi Daoming could still smile, greeting Meng Xinghai and chatting about old times from their youth.

Cui He and Cui Shuning took a long time to recover. The "seed" talent favored by the Esoteric Cult had actually been defeated, further demonstrating that Qin Ming was qualified to enter the Six Imperial Sects, and his potential was even greater than they had imagined.

Cui Shuning turned, just in time to see people from the Wang family. They said nothing and were already walking deeper into the night fog, about to leave the area. Cui He suppressed a belly full of anger. He had been made a laughingstock by a group of acquaintances, and now he had to hand over the fragmented scriptures of the *Yi Wood Scripture* and the *World-Dwelling Scripture*. It was too disheartening.

Sure enough, Meng Xinghai walked straight over, all smiles, and extended his hand to Cui He. Without a moment's hesitation, he publicly demanded the scriptures.

"You, Meng, you're too rude!" Cui He's hair shimmered with a green light as he fumed.

After Meng Xinghai obtained the scriptures, he couldn't be bothered to say more to him and turned to leave.

By now, Qin Ming was surrounded by many people. Even Yu Zhuohan, the Esoteric Cult's new talent, had come over; it seemed they had become acquainted through conflict.

"Guests from afar," Meng Xinghai called out to everyone, inviting elders, young adults, and youngsters alike, "let's return to Crimson Glow City. I'll be your host and throw a welcoming feast for you all."

On the way back, Qin Ming pondered his future. Now that he had more options, which sect would be most suitable for him to join?

Meng Xinghai was very serious. "You need to think about this carefully. Later, you should also get a 'golden invitation' from the Six Imperial Sects. More options are always better than none." With that, he handed the fragmented scriptures of the *Yi Wood Scripture* and the *World-Dwelling Scripture* to Qin Ming.

A hazy light emanated from Lu Yuzhi as she moved through the night fog, like an ethereal and transcendent spirit walking out of the forest. She approached Qin Ming, smiling, "I never expected you to be an Extraordinary Individual. The way you discerned eight colors of Heavenly Light Energy in the Purple Bamboo Forest of Jinrui City truly astonished me."

Her admiration was genuine. She was impressed that a youth, who had not yet entered a Daoist lineage like Jade Purity or the Six Imperials, possessed such a profound understanding of Heavenly Light Energy. It was truly remarkable. In Lu Yuzhi's opinion, even the young Extraordinary Individuals secretly cultivated by great sects' ancestral grounds were no better. She even believed that after Qin Ming entered the Jade Purity Sect, received guidance from its elders, and arduously cultivated the sect's foundational Jade Purity Energy, he might have a sliver of hope to compete for titles like "Young Sect Master" or "Young Patriarch."

She smiled brightly and asked, "I wonder if you're interested in joining the Jade Purity lineage?"

Qin Ming felt that the Jade Purity lineage was preparing for the coming Great Opening Era, expanding rapidly. Their method of recruiting disciples was different from the past, meaning they might not meticulously cultivate each one, but he was still very interested. Lu Yuzhi handed him a golden scroll, telling him that holding it would grant him a core disciple examination at the Jade Purity lineage's ancestral grounds. Qin Ming nodded with a smile, expressing his gratitude, and carefully put it away. Regardless of whether he would eventually go, having one more option was always a good thing.

Not far away, Cui He and Cui Shuning were startled. The Jade Purity lineage had actively extended a "golden invitation," which made them feel even more unpleasant. Ironically, the one who extended the invitation was Lu Yuzhi, an Extraordinary Individual of the Jade Purity lineage. Even they, people of the older generation, dared not easily offend her.

"Qin Ming!" A group of young people, both male and female, enthusiastically surrounded him. With Lu Yuzhi there, they naturally gravitated over.

"Everyone, long time no see," Qin Ming greeted them with a smile.

"Hand them over!" Meng Xinghai saw Cui He stalling, unwilling to give up the scriptures, and even getting distracted by Qin Ming's group. He immediately took matters into his own hands and snatched them.

"You, Meng, you're too rude!" Cui He's hair shimmered with a green light as he fumed.

After Meng Xinghai obtained the scriptures, he couldn't be bothered to say more to him and turned to leave.

By now, Qin Ming was surrounded by many people. Even Yu Zhuohan, the Esoteric Cult's new talent, had come over; it seemed they had become acquainted through conflict.
