## Chapter 34: Brutal

A group of people trekked through the dense forest. Zhang Yuezhen's spirits lifted as she saw occasional bloodstains on the ground. The Zhang family harbored a deep hatred for Sun Shu. If Zhang Yuezhen seized this opportunity to kill Sun Shu, her position within the Zhang family would be secured, and no one would dare to gossip about her role as the manager of the medical hall.

Ahead, a dilapidated temple appeared. In the vicinity of Pingyin County, there wasn't much else, but such ruined temples were plentiful. It hadn't completely collapsed, partly because passing merchant caravans sometimes camped there and tidied it up a bit.

"Everyone, take the antidote pills!"

At Zhang Yuezhen's command, the guards quickly produced antidote pills. Chen Fei, standing at the very back, also swallowed one.

"Whoever kills Sun Shu, I'll give them half of the main family's bounty this time, and their wages will be tripled from now on!"

Zhang Yuezhen turned to face the guards and said in a deep voice, "Sun Shu is already severely injured. Be careful, and there shouldn't be much of a problem. Now, the three of you, go first!"

Zhang Yuezhen pointed at three guards. The three exchanged glances, gritted their teeth, and charged directly towards the dilapidated temple. Half of the Zhang family's bounty – that amount was too tempting. They had never imagined Zhang Yuezhen would be willing to offer so much. Plus, triple wages from now on would completely secure their future livelihood. Most importantly, Sun Shu was injured.

Shouts continued to emanate from the dilapidated temple, and the clash of weapons was incessant, as if the battle inside had reached its final stage. Chen Fei kept his eyes on the temple when he suddenly felt a chill on his wrist. Looking down, he saw that the strange mark from back then was now exceptionally active. Chen Fei's pupils contracted. This 'bone-deep ulcer' mark was usually quite dormant, and with his continuous cultivation improvements, it had been gradually fading. Why was it acting up now?

"All of you, go in!"

Zhang Yuezhen pointed at the last two guards. They excitedly acknowledged her command and rushed in without hesitation.

"You go too!"

Zhang Yuezhen looked at Chen Fei and said, "Don't say I didn't give you a chance. It should be almost over inside. Perhaps you'll get an opportunity to deliver the final blow!"

"Something's not right inside. Listen, don't the sounds coming from within seem a bit similar to before?"

Chen Fei looked at the dilapidated temple and involuntarily took a step back. He hadn't felt anything until the 'bone-deep ulcer' mark acted up. Then, he listened closely to the sounds from inside. To Chen Fei's horror, although the shouts inside the temple sounded fervent, a careful listener would realize that many of the sounds were actually repetitive. During intense combat, one might unconsciously overlook this detail. But with careful observation, one could still detect something amiss.

When Zhang Yuezhen saw Chen Fei's movements, a triumphant smile appeared on her face. Daring to draw his sword against her first—if she could only give Chen Fei a lesson before, now, even if she crippled him, no one would say a word. A mere Skin Tempering realm cultivator, utterly ignorant of his own mortality!

As she thought this, Zhang Yuezhen's grapple was about to accelerate when she suddenly noticed Chen Fei's longsword vanish, leaving only a flash of light in her vision.

"No!"

Zhang Yuezhen's heart jolted with alarm. Just as she was about to turn sideways to dodge, a sharp pain erupted in her chest, followed by a complete loss of sensation in that area. Zhang Yuezhen looked down in disbelief at the wound that had pierced through her chest, front to back, from which blood was continuously gushing. She instinctively clutched the wound, but she couldn't stop the blood from flowing out.

Zhang Yuezhen lifted her head to look at Chen Fei, her eyes filled with incredulity. How could a mere Skin Tempering realm cultivator possess such a sword technique, one that she couldn't even react to?
