# Chapter 66: Vitality Wine

"Peach Blossom Sword Seal!"

"The sword strikes like falling peach blossoms—dazzling and unpredictable. It can split into a hundred beams of sword light to slice through enemies or converge into a single strike to vanquish demons and evil."

"This sword seal is forged from five-hundred-year-old peach wood and possesses inherent suppression effects against all demonic creatures and malevolent cultivators."

As Gu Yuan picked up the jade slip, the sword seal's information automatically surfaced in his mind. At first glance, the technique appeared ordinary, but the densely packed, radiant sword patterns made his scalp tingle. 

This sword seal undoubtedly required exceptional comprehension to master. Yet once perfected, it would unleash formidable power—a truly superior-grade seal technique.

"Since the elder has been so generous, this junior cannot be stingy either. These jade and iron tools, along with this storage pouch, are my gifts to you."

After briefly examining the sword seal, Gu Yuan stored it away and handed a storage pouch to the white-haired elder ape. He had sold most of the pouches obtained from killing Kuang Mingsheng and others, keeping only one or two for emergencies.

The elder ape accepted the pouch, inspected its contents, and smiled. With these tools, the mining and storage of spirit stones would become significantly more efficient.

"Chirp chirp chirp!"

Meanwhile, the golden-backed ape beneath it stared eagerly at the storage pouch, gesturing excitedly.

"Alright, alright, it's yours!" The elder ape chuckled and tossed the pouch to the golden-backed ape.

The golden-backed ape carefully took it, channeled its spiritual sense, and instantly refined the pouch, which emitted a faint glow.

"Whoosh!"

It then retrieved the pouch and aimed it at some loose stones on the ground. A flash of light later, the stones vanished.

"Chirp chirp chirp!" The golden-backed ape was overjoyed, grinning from ear to ear.

"Swish, swish, swish!"

Mimicking what it had seen, it stored and retrieved various items from the cave repeatedly, thoroughly entertained.

Watching this, the elder ape gently patted the golden-backed ape's back and smiled apologetically at Gu Yuan. "Big Baby has lived on Spirit Crane Island since birth and never ventured outside. Resources here are scarce—aside from one handy magical tool, it's never owned anything else. Forgive its childish excitement."

The Green Peak Dao Academy wasn't a charity. It kept spirit beasts to harvest resources, not to nurture them, hence the lack of magical tools. Despite its strength, the golden-backed ape had never even seen a basic storage pouch before.

Gu Yuan didn't laugh but sighed, "Such pure-hearted innocence!"

This incident deepened his fondness for the golden-backed ape, who seemed like an innocent, kind-hearted child.

The perceptive elder ape sensed Gu Yuan's sincerity and smiled warmly. Stroking the golden-backed ape's head, it instructed, "Enough playing. Prepare a feast to thank our young immortal guest."

Reluctantly, the golden-backed ape tucked the pouch into its belly fur and bowed to Gu Yuan with a grin.

"Chirp chirp chirp!"

Like a child, its earlier grievances vanished with the gift, replaced by genuine gratitude and joy.

"You're too kind!" Gu Yuan returned the bow.

Delighted by his response, the golden-backed ape bowed twice more before slapping another golden-backed ape awake and pointing at the wine jars and spirit fruits, then at Gu Yuan.

"Chirp chirp chirp!"

The newly awakened ape, still dazed, dared not disobey. It carefully carried the jars and fruits to Gu Yuan.

Meanwhile, the lower-grade yellow apes from deeper in the cave swarmed in, setting up a stone table and stool before him, arranging the offerings neatly. One even fetched a willow branch to dust the stool, obsequiously inviting Gu Yuan to sit.

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan lifted a jar and took a hearty swig.

"Excellent wine!"

The rich fruit aroma and mellow liquor warmed his throat and belly, suffusing his limbs with comfort. A surge of potent spiritual energy from his dantian stirred his法力, slightly enhancing it.

"Truly worthy of being recorded in the Dao Academy's treasury—this wine is extraordinary!" 

His cheeks flushed, but his aura grew steadier. The wine's robust flavor and fragrance, like a burst of myriad spirit fruits, were indescribably delightful. Gu Yuan drank several more mouthfuls.

The elder ape laughed heartily at his enjoyment.

"Chirp chirp chirp!"

The golden-backed ape with dual pupils sneakily brought over a fiery-red jar, offering it to Gu Yuan with a mischievous grin.

---

"What kind of wine is this?" Gu Yuan hesitated.

"Chirp chirp chirp!"

The ape didn't answer, insistently pushing the jar toward him.

Gu Yuan glanced at the elder ape, who merely smiled cryptically.

Reluctantly, he took a sip.

"Boom!"

An overwhelming heat surged into his belly, accelerating his blood flow downward. A peculiar tingling and swelling sensation followed, as if something was growing.

"This is..."

Gu Yuan was both amused and exasperated. Who would have thought such a seemingly innocent ape could brew such a potent "Vitality Wine"? 

The effects, however, were undeniably impressive—something was definitely expanding, as if undergoing a second growth spurt.

Though intrigued, Gu Yuan waved his hands. "No more, no more!"

Yet the wine seemed to have a mind of its own, continuously pouring into his mouth. In moments, he had drained the entire jar.

"*Burp!*"

Gu Yuan hiccuped, his face flushed crimson, his waist and lower abdomen burning.

The dual-pupiled ape stared at the empty jar in disbelief.

"Whoosh! Whoosh!"

It turned the jar upside down and shook it vigorously—nothing came out. 

Dejected, it pouted while the elder ape roared with laughter.

Behind the waterfall, amidst the gathering of humans and apes, the rustic feast concluded in boisterous merriment.
