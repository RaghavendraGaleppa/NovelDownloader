# Chapter 104: Provocation

In the courtyard where Xu Yunfan resided within the Foundry Hall's territory, Zhan Yan had just brought news of the Disciple Inauguration Ceremony to be held three months later. At that moment, Xu Yunfan was bare-legged, his muscles bulging with veins, practicing the tendon-stretching technique of the Flying Scalpels on an iron pillar.

Every snap of his leg produced a whistling sound through the air, the tendons at his ankles tightening like two twisted cowhide whips.

"Master, rest assured. As long as..."

Xu Yunfan spoke, raising one leg high, his shin pressing against his forehead. The sound of bowstrings snapping echoed between his legs from time to time.

Suddenly, he grinned, feeling he shouldn't speak too definitively, and changed his words. "If it's just those people from the Sky Crafting Cave, I can take them on even with one hand tied behind my back."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's confidence, a smile appeared on Zhan Yan's face. From their first meeting, he knew this boy had been through the struggles of the Jianghu and had blood on his hands; his combat capability was beyond doubt.

"Confidence is good, but you must remember, even a lion uses all its strength to catch a rabbit. Don't be careless."

Xu Yunfan agreed immediately. "Master is right. Back in Wuzhou, I saw a First-Rank Martial Teacher get stabbed in the kidney by the orphan of a man whose legs he had cut off."

Zhan Yan nodded slightly upon hearing this and didn't say much more. They exchanged some pleasantries, but there was no need for further talk.

Not long after he left the courtyard, Fu Jin, carrying twin hammers and riding a scaled horse, led three others and galloped straight toward Qingzhou.

The news that the Foundry Hall would hold a Disciple Inauguration Ceremony in three months quickly spread throughout Cangzhou. As the only forging master capable of crafting Treasure-grade weapons in the Sky Crafting Cave, Zhan Yan naturally drew the attention of many.

In the days that followed, Xu Yunfan paid no mind to the affairs of the outside world. He had a surplus of exotic beast meat, a spiritual fish caught daily from the翠波 Lake in Cuibo City, and took Yuanzhu Pills as if they were candy. He was almost entirely immersed in his martial training.

The originally slow progression of his proficiency, aided by spiritual pills and miraculous medicines, increased at a跨越式 (leaping) rate.

On the seventh day after the news spread, Xu Yunfan was soaking in an iron bathing tub, his skin and flesh turned red.

'You practiced the Flying Scalpels day and night and suddenly felt the muscles of your legs were like agile leopards, perfectly echoing the rhythm of your steps. When sprinting, you are as swift as an arrow leaving the string; when turning, you are as agile as a rabbit穿林 (passing through the forest). Amidst the howling wind, your control over speed and flexibility has reached a new level. Proficiency in Flying Scalpels has increased.'

'...'

After a whole day of this, Xu Yunfan lay comfortably soaking in the medicinal bath. The soup was boiling with the fishy scent of tiger bone powder. Looking at the proficiency notifications that nearly filled his vision today, he couldn't help but grin.

He spread his legs, and two outer female disciples of the Sky Crafting Cave were pounding his legs with fists the size of vinegar bowls, continuously kneading his muscles to relieve fatigue and further penetrate the medicinal effects of the bath.

Looking at the two female disciples working happily, Xu Yunfan tightened the linen cloth covering his modesty around his waist and asked, "You two seem to enjoy this?"

The girl on the left had a figure like a Vajra; her muscles bulged and veins protruded as she kneaded, the muscles on her shoulders and back rising and falling like mountain ranges, yet her face was delicate. She said joyfully, "Senior Brother, you just arrived and might not know. In the Affairs Hall of the Sky Crafting Cave, the Foundry Hall posted this task a few days ago. One session earns quite a bit of Sect Contribution. It's equivalent to half a month's duty pay. Many Senior Brothers and Sisters were fighting to take it. I finally managed to get it."

The girl on the right applied even more ferocious force, her ten fingers digging into the vital points of his knee hollows, making even Xu Yunfan grit his teeth. This girl had a curvy figure, but one could still see the strength contained in her muscles.

The girl nodded repeatedly. "I started lining up at dawn yesterday, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten this job."

Xu Yunfan: "..."

After washing up refreshingly and receiving Xu Yunfan's confirmation by signing the task slip, the two physically imposing girls left happily and quickly.

Xu Yunfan watched them go, speechless. Just as he was about to pick up the heavy hammer beside him to warm up, the courtyard gate exploded with a loud noise. The gate of the courtyard was kicked open with a 'bang'.

Amidst the rain of splintered wood from the broken door hinges, a giant man squeezed in, his muscles undulating like mountain ranges, standing nearly two and a half meters tall. His trapezius muscles piled up like two camel humps, the muscles in his neck twisted into straight steel cables, and his waist was actually thicker than the old locust tree in the courtyard by half a circle.

When the giant took a step, the floor tiles groaned heavily, his footsteps so heavy they made people gasp for breath.

"Xu Yunfan?"

Two streams of white breath spewed from the giant's nostrils, his voice like a rough gong scraping an iron pot. Looking at the skinny monkey before him, a trace of contempt appeared on his face.

"Who are you?"

"Yue Shan of the Hidden Blade Pavilion. I'm here today to see what kind of person the Disciple Inauguration Ceremony of the Foundry Hall has designated as a true disciple three months from now."

Hearing that it was someone from the Hidden Blade Pavilion, Xu Yunfan's expression relaxed slightly. He sized up the other party, figured out the situation, put down the heavy hammer in his hand, and walked up to Yue Shan.

"Good name."

Hearing Xu Yunfan's praise, a mocking smile appeared on Yue Shan's face. However, the words Xu Yunfan spoke next made his expression freeze instantly.

"But didn't your elders teach you that you need to knock before entering someone else's house? Are you an orphan with no parents to teach you?"

Since the other party came with ill intentions, Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't be polite.

A flash of anger passed through Yue Shan's eyes. His palm, the size of a millstone, pressed down toward Xu Yunfan. Just as his right palm was about to land on the skinny monkey's shoulder, his wrist bone was suddenly clamped by five red-hot iron pincers. He wanted to press down, but his hand stopped halfway, frozen in place.

Xu Yunfan's knuckles cracked as he fixed the millstone-sized hand in mid-air, firmly gripping Yue Shan's wrist like an iron hoop. No matter how hard Yue Shan pulled, Xu Yunfan remained unmoving.

"Did the Hidden Blade Pavilion teach you to practice with door panels?"

Xu Yunfan flashed a mouthful of white teeth. "With so little strength, did you grow tall but not smart?"

Yue Shan's blood immediately rushed to his head, the veins on his forehead bulging. The muscles on his pressing right arm rapidly swelled, chunks of muscle popping out like肉瘤 (fleshy tumors). Veins throbbed wildly on his bulging deltoid, looking like a dozen centipedes swimming under his skin.

*Crack!*

The three-inch-thick blue bricks under Yue Shan's feet shattered and splashed, his ankles sinking half a foot into the earth.

However, the opposite Xu Yunfan, apart from the diamond-shaped bulging of his arm muscles and slight twitching of veins under his skin, had a face as calm as water, as if he hadn't even warmed up yet.

Yue Shan's eyes turned red instantly. He let out a low roar from his mouth, and as he raised his other hand, Xu Yunfan suddenly withdrew his strength. Yue Shan's blood and energy reversed, his strength spent, and as he stumbled, he knocked over several iron pillars in the courtyard, rolling onto the ground.

Xu Yunfan watched with a smile as Yue Shan, his face filled with shame and anger, scrambled up from the ground.

Completely blinded by rage, Yue Shan grabbed an iron pillar with one hand and tried to lift it to charge forward. Suddenly, a rough hand slammed onto his shoulder.

The sudden, immense force made his giant body unable to withstand it. He fell to one knee, his body crushed so low he could only support himself with his knee.

(Still ten thousand words today, two chapters in the afternoon and evening respectively.)
