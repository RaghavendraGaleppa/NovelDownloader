# Chapter 132: Visitor from Another Realm

Lin Shan excitedly tucked the storage artifact he had obtained from Elder Turtle into his robes, planning to thoroughly examine it once he had settled the current situation. 

The artifact appeared to be a bracelet, but he didn't dare wear it openly. After all, many powerful demonic cultivators had fought Elder Turtle for two to three years, and some might recognize this treasure. If he flaunted it, wouldn't that be admitting his involvement?

Demonic sects wouldn't protect personal property. Everyone knew Elder Turtle was fabulously wealthy. If a mere early Foundation Establishment youngster like him paraded such immense riches around, he wouldn't survive past the next day.

Lin Shan understood the principle that "a man's wealth is his own ruin." After so many experiences, he realized these high-level cultivators were all cunning foxes. 

Even someone as formidable as Elder Turtle—a veteran Golden Core cultivator, wily as a fox, and exceptionally powerful—had been fatally wounded by just over a dozen Golden Core experts from the three demonic sects. 

Lin Shan was far inferior to Elder Turtle in both strength and experience, clearly still a small fry in the cultivation world. Only by keeping a low profile could he survive long enough to grow stronger.

To rise above others, he needed more opportunities and greater power.

...

While Lin Shan was reveling in his good fortune, the Foundation Establishment youth beside him had completely lost his mind.

After enduring humiliation for over a decade on Turtle Fishing Island, playing the fool under the watchful eyes of his senior brothers and sisters, then accompanying Elder Turtle across tens of thousands of miles of ocean for three years, he had finally outlasted all his competitors. 

Just as his master, on his deathbed, had no choice but to choose him as the successor—on the cusp of becoming the ultimate victor—Lin Shan had swooped in and plucked the prize. Anyone would be driven mad by such a turn of events!

Covered in black spots and as bald as a plucked quail, the youth brandished his magical weapon and lunged at Lin Shan.

But it was all futile. Having been ambushed by three consecutive curse techniques and given no time to recover before Lin Shan barged in, the black spots had already corroded nearly all his spiritual energy. He stood no chance in a fight.

Ten breaths later, Lin Shan retrieved his Five Elements Fan and flying sword, then leisurely addressed the skull that was attempting to sneak out of the cultivation chamber while its occupants were preoccupied.

"Where do you think you're going, friend?"

"Kak?"

The skull turned stiffly, the green ghostly flames in its eye sockets flickering uncertainly as its jaw dropped open to reveal pearly white teeth.

"Young friend, didn't you summon me to deal with your enemy? Now that the enemy is gone, I assume my services are no longer needed. Naturally, I should return."

"Return where?"

"To the otherworld, of course—the one not of this realm."

"Then why not return right here? Why sneak away?"

Lin Shan smirked as he studied the skull. Initially, he had been somewhat apprehensive about the eerie entities summoned by curses, but earlier, blinded by greed for Elder Turtle's legacy, he had absentmindedly slapped the skull without a second thought—only to realize afterward that this thing might just be all bark and no bite.

Seeing it try to flee from him, Lin Shan's courage swelled. He decided to gather some information about these curse-summoned entities.

Realizing escape was impossible, the skull didn't attempt to force its way out—after all, it was just a skull and lacked the means to flee.

"Let's speak plainly. What do you intend to do with me, young friend?"

"Where are you from?"

"The Fifth Hellworld, Skull Demon Ridge."

Hearing about another world for the first time, Lin Shan's eyes widened with curiosity. He pressed for more details.

"What's your world like?"

"Worlds aren't so different. Ours is surrounded by seas of magma, with volcanic continents dotting the landscape, inhabited by various races."

"That's not different?" Lin Shan was taken aback. A world surrounded by magma seas—wouldn't that be unbearably hot?

"For the denizens of hell, magma seas are like your human oceans; volcanic lands are akin to your spiritual mountains and plains. It's perfectly normal for us."

The skull had clearly traveled many worlds and was well-versed. Seeing no way out, it figured it might as well chat with Lin Shan during this soul projection.

"The Fifth Hellworld is vast, home to over a thousand known races. I'm just an ordinary member of the Skull Clan, with branches like Blood Jade Skulls, Black Diamond Skulls, Green Marrow Skulls, and Purple Venom Skulls."

"Our world has a summoning contract with a mighty immortal from the Immortal Realm. When the contract activates, it means a summoner from another world is projecting a call, and all creatures rush to respond."

"You must be a disciple of that immortal's legacy in the mortal realm, hence your ability to summon me to weaken your foe. Since I've fulfilled my purpose, by rights, you should release me."

...

After listening to the skull's lengthy explanation, Lin Shan pieced together that the immortal who had contracted with its world was likely the source of the curse—the immortal artifact "Seven Arrows Book of Nails." 

As for the so-called equivalent exchange, it seemed the artifact took offerings and rewarded these hellish creatures with some mysterious substance, which explained their eagerness to respond to summons.

"And if I let you go, what would you do with your newfound freedom?"

The skull paused, its ghostly flames flickering as if deep in thought before replying, "Naturally, I'd explore this new world. If I can grow stronger here, all the better."

"If I can elevate this projection to match my main body's cultivation, returning would double my power."

"That's why creatures from my world are so eager to answer summons—it's for our own cultivation."

...

As it spoke, the skull began hopping around excitedly, its hellish nature making its thoughts erratic and unconventional.

Lin Shan nodded, half-listening to its ramblings while thoroughly cleaning the chamber to ensure no traces remained. He destroyed the formation arrays around the cave dwelling and incinerated the bodies of Elder Turtle and his disciple with his Five Elements Fan.

Between cleaning, he casually chatted with the skull.

"How does this projection of yours grow stronger?"

"By gathering materials to construct a skeletal body!"

"Interesting. What's your main body's cultivation level?"

"Nascent Soul stage."

"Hmm, not that impress—wait, what did you say?"

"Nascent Soul stage!"

"You?" Lin Shan eyed the harmless-looking skull skeptically. Even an ordinary person could probably kick it away. Nascent Soul stage?

The skull bristled, hopping furiously as if deeply offended.

"I am the Black Skull Demon Lord, ruler of a million-mile radius in Skull Demon Ridge of the Fifth Hellworld!"

"Brat, don't think you can easily manipulate me just because you've got me now. This is merely a minor projection."

"At worst, I'll abandon it—my main body back home has plenty of summoning contracts to fulfill!"

"Countless contracts are activated daily in hell. You think I care about this one?"

...

Lin Shan was stunned. He hadn't expected this skull to have such a formidable background. "Demon Lord" sounded incredibly impressive!

His mind raced as he quickly hatched a plan.

"Hey, hey, no need to get angry, Lord Black Skull! If you don't mind, how about I call you Brother Black Skull?"

"You dare?"

"Come now, don't be like that! A guest is a guest—how could I let Brother Black Skull hop around on the ground? Please, perch on my shoulder!"

"Brat, what's with that look? Like you're plotting something."

"Not at all! Since this is your first time here, as a local, host, and authority figure, it's only right that I show you around!"

"I don't need a tour. I can hop just fine."

"We're on a remote island in the middle of the East Sea. Where exactly do you plan to hop?"

Lin Shan flew into the night sky on his sword, the Black Skull Demon Lord perched on his shoulder. After circling Prawn Barbarian Island, the skull realized they were surrounded by endless ocean with no land in sight.

"Perhaps I spoke too soon..." it muttered.

"Not only that, but the East Sea is currently controlled by three demonic sects. If you hop out there, you might run into some troublemakers who'd love to turn you into a skull artifact. Why suffer that?"

"They wouldn't dare!"

The skull on his shoulder sounded indignant, though its lack of intelligence as a projection made its anger seem almost comical.

Lin Shan quickly steered the conversation, flying back to his newly claimed cave dwelling. He seated the skull respectfully opposite him, serving it a bowl of "82-year-old bone broth."

"Since you have nowhere to go, why not stay with me for now? I'll help you gather materials to strengthen this projection."

"When the time comes, your main body and projection merging at the Nascent Soul stage will elevate your power, making you unrivaled in hell!"

...

Lin Shan's voice dripped with persuasion as he spun his web. A Nascent Soul-stage hellish creature as an ally? That would be an incredible asset!

Why bother raising pets when he could nurture a Nascent Soul skull?

As for helping it reach Nascent Soul stage before letting it return? Nonsense! Once it became his lackey, it would remain so for eternity. Returning home? Not a chance!

The skull stared blankly at the bone broth, its ghostly flames flickering uncertainly.

"That... does sound reasonable."

Lin Shan beamed, quickly bonding with the skull until they were calling each other brothers.

The skull then spat out a silver parchment and offered it to Lin Shan.

"This is our Skull Clan's Spirit Contract. Sign it, and we'll be allies. Call me brother, and I'll have your back!"

If it had a full skeleton, it would have thumped its chest emphatically.

Lin Shan cautiously accepted the so-called "Spirit Contract," using his enhancement panel to verify its authenticity.

[Contract Parchment]
Quality: Silver Contract
Description: Binds Foundation Establishment cultivators and below. Violators suffer Dao Heart damage and demonic invasion.
Enhancement Cost: 32 points

Relieved it wasn't a slave or pet contract, and noting it only bound Foundation Establishment cultivators—which suited his plans to break free upon reaching Golden Core—Lin Shan readily pricked his finger to sign.

Once the contract was sealed, he felt an inexplicable connection to the skull, as if their fates were now intertwined.

But as the terms materialized on the parchment, Lin Shan's expression darkened.

The contract stated: Lin Shan must unconditionally gather materials to elevate the skull's projection to Nascent Soul stage, while the skull could choose whether or not to assist him as it pleased.

"You tricked me?"

The skull's earlier dullness vanished as it cackled maniacally.

"Brat, thought you could con me into being your lackey? Too naive!"

As a Demon Lord from the chaotic Fifth Hellworld, even if its projection occasionally malfunctioned, it wasn't so easily fooled. It had hidden the contract's true terms, exploiting Lin Shan's inexperience to secure a favorable deal.

"By the way, kid, I hate bone broth! Kakaka~"

The courtyard fell silent save for the skull's mocking laughter.

Was Lin Shan now doomed to serve the skull forever?

After a moment's thought, his former Chinese class representative instincts kicked in. He spotted a loophole.

"There's no time limit specified."

He scrutinized the contract, his eyes lighting up. 

"So theoretically, I could take ten thousand years to gather the materials without breaching the contract?"

"Uh...?" The skull's laughter died abruptly.
