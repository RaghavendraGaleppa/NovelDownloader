# Chapter 35: Mysterious Treasure Acquired

In the age when the sun had vanished, even in the faint night, distant scenery appeared somewhat blurry. A little further away, towering mountains were mere dark silhouettes against the night.

Now, everything was different. Deep within the mountain range, ten colossal pillars of light pierced the heavens, illuminating all directions with a brilliance far surpassing the five-colored mist. In a trance, it felt as if day had returned.

Not to mention the towering mountains, even every blade of grass and every tree on the cliffs could be seen with absolute clarity. The colors and textures of the strange birds flying low were distinctly visible, vibrant and lively.

Everyone felt as if the dust in their hearts had been blown away, and a curtain before their eyes lifted. What they saw was pure radiance, mountains and all creation visible and imprinted upon their minds. Even in the harsh winter when ice and snow sealed the mountains, it felt as though all things were revitalizing, everything so vibrant, natural, and inviting.

Old Man Liu sat on the big yellow dog, agitated, saying, "I've lived for over seventy years, and this is the first time I've seen such a brilliant world, such a magnificent heaven and earth! Is this what the splendid mountains and rivers are truly meant to be? What a pity, even as a newly awakened one, capable of seeing distant objects, I always felt a thin veil before my eyes on ordinary days."

Cao Long spoke, "Cities of medium scale and above actually..."

He didn't continue. It wasn't appropriate to discuss such things with an old man from a remote area; the other party couldn't leave this place, and mentioning it further would only cause regret.

He changed his words, "I haven't actually been to many places either. The vast and boundless dark world is too immense. So-called brilliant cities are all like places of fireflies."

Deep in the mountains, the powerhouses from major organizations and the high-level beings seemed to have gone mad, all rushing towards the place where the ten pillars of light pierced the sky.

But in the outer regions, Mu Qing, Wei Zhirou, Cao Long, and others remained calm. They merely observed from afar, even chatting amongst themselves.

They understood clearly that those opportunities were not for them. Even top experts who rushed in might die. That special nexus was destined to be stained red with the blood of powerhouses.

Not everyone could clearly assess their own position. Too many people in the mountains were consumed by envy. Of course, they weren't blindly confident; they weren't rushing towards the battleground of high-level beings.

The ten-colored radiance tore through the night sky. This was an abnormal spectacle beyond the scope of common knowledge, something never seen before on other famous mountains where 'heavenly light' had descended.

Perhaps it had occurred, but someone had deliberately concealed it, as it was not recorded in any books.

Therefore, the various groups of people, envious but still able to maintain restraint, turned and rushed towards the place where the five-colored mist ascended, settling for the next best thing.

In fact, this was also an extremely rare anomalous sight, undoubtedly corresponding to an extraordinary and rare treasure.

However, too many people had come with this objective. As soon as the various factions met, this section of the mountain forest was stained red, the competition incredibly fierce.

"Mountain God, this place is completely lawless! More people are dying here than at the ten heaven-piercing pillars of light!"

"There are even high-level anomalies here! They didn't go to compete in the ten-colored zone, run!"

After being baptized by blood and losing a batch of people in moments, the remaining large contingents from various factions turned and fled, quite decisively.

People saw high-level beings enveloped in thick mist, immense in size, stomping on cliffs, already nearing that special nexus.

Almost instantly, a humanoid being, flapping wide wings and wreathed in crimson light, descended from the sky, blocking the high-level being's path.

"Was that an earthquake?" The crevice in the ground shook violently, startling Qin Ming who immediately rushed out. He was genuinely afraid of being crushed to death deep underground.

He then saw two grand and imposing spectacles, as if daylight had returned to the world. A deluge of light-rain scattered, making all mountains and creations clearly visible.

He had self-awareness; the mysterious and unfathomable treasures born from those two nexuses were not for him. Daring to approach even a single step would mean dying without a burial place.

Standing outside the crevice's exit, Qin Ming could only feel envy. Those masters dominating the depths of the mountains, the ultimate victors, would obtain immense benefits.

Even from his distant, quiet zone, he could hear people in the mountains shouting that the ten-colored nexus was unheard of, and likely to produce treasures of immeasurable grade.

"I finally know why this place is so heaven-defying! Not only did heavenly light descend here two years ago, but it also fell two hundred years ago! Back then, there were no proper treasures at all. The previous heavenly light accumulated for two hundred years and merged with the heavenly light that arrived two years ago, creating this astonishing spectacle before us!"

An elder in the mountain forest spoke excitedly. He was a knowledgeable and strong-willed individual who had thoroughly researched this area and consulted numerous texts. Now, he revealed the reason for this place's abnormality.

"I've also heard rumors. Two hundred years ago, an exceptionally thick beam of heavenly light descended here, startling even the people of the royal capital, who dispatched powerhouses. Yet, the place turned out to be incredibly barren, making all the experts who rushed here wish they could flatten these mountains."

Apart from the high-level beings, everyone else in the mountain range could only observe and discuss. No one dared to risk approaching the two 'creation lands' anymore.

Soon after, many people exclaimed in surprise. Even the high-level beings and human experts, whose eyes were bloodshot from fighting in the center of the battlefield, were dumbfounded.

The two special nexuses, with their heaven-piercing radiance, shifted once again.

"Could there be some monster underground?" Even the normally peaceful and serene Old Weasel began to twitch its face, truly tormented.

This time, the five-colored mist and the ten heaven-piercing pillars of light seemed to be moving in circles, confined within a certain range, and moving swiftly.

"They're rapidly shifting along the spiritual earth veins created by the heavenly light! They're pulling at each other, the circles they trace are constantly shrinking, slowly drawing closer!"

Not only did the experts personally in the fray discover this, but outsiders observing from afar saw it even more clearly.

"Are the two mysterious treasures going to merge into one place?" Everyone was filled with doubt; this completely exceeded their understanding.

Ling Xu, Wei Mo, and the others, along with other high-level anomalies, were practically losing their temper, chasing after the two spectacles but unable to make contact.

Even if they got close, as soon as they entered the special nexus, they would disappear again, continuously shifting. Finally, some high-level beings began to stake out a spot.

Qin Ming watched in astonishment. The nexus he was at wasn't within that range; it was quite tranquil, and no one had come over for the time being.

"Hmm?" He noticed that the crevice beneath his feet was also 'stirring,' beginning to gush out silver threads with a faint golden sheen, occasionally mixed with purple mist, and crimson light.

He instantly felt a surge of excitement. Could there be some precious treasure here about to mature? When he went in earlier, he hadn't seen anything.

Could it be that because of the drastic changes deep within the mountains, this place also 'benefited'?

He quickly rushed inside. The place where the multi-colored lights intertwined was certainly unrelated to him, but if he could gather even one of the slightly lesser, or much lesser, treasures, he would be incredibly satisfied.

Underground, the silver beams of light intertwined, much thicker than before. And as he delved deeper, he could feel a strange fluctuation.

This feeling was similar to when he practiced the 'New Life Method' recorded on the silk scroll here, as if he were soaking in a hot spring and receiving a baptism of silver threads.

Now, without doing anything, he already detected a warmth spreading before him. He traced that special ripple all the way, quickly reaching its source.

Here, the path was blocked by a pile of rubble; there was no way forward.

Without a second thought, Qin Ming immediately began clearing the rocks. He moved them all aside, revealing a new crevice that led to deeper underground levels.

Along the way, he repeatedly used the long-handled dark gold hammer in his hand to clear a path, smashing the crevice wider. Finally, he arrived at the source of the strange fluctuations.

From the deeper part of the crevice, colorful mist gushed out, enveloping a black stone about half the size of a human head.

"What is this?" Qin Ming believed this must be one of the special treasures that everyone was vying for, but he didn't know what the black stone was used for.

Within this special nexus, although various colored mists flowed, causing him intermittent chest tightness and panic, his body could still endure it.

He saw the mist surging from the crevice towards the black stone gradually thinning, beginning to recede like a tide. Did this mean it was about to 'mature' completely?

Qin Ming didn't act rashly; he waited quietly. His body could still hold on, and as the mist dissipated, he no longer felt any discomfort.

A moment later, silence fell. All anomalies vanished, and the half-human-head-sized stone looked utterly ordinary, probably wouldn't be picked up by anyone if thrown away.

However, if he concentrated and felt for it, he could still detect a very faint ripple. This was the special perception he gained after experiencing the baptism of silver light emanating from the crevice.

"I can produce a faint resonance with special treasures nurtured by heavenly light."

Qin Ming took the stone into his hand; it felt heavy. He really wanted to peel open its skin and see what was inside.

But he suppressed the impulse. He had to leave immediately; it would be big trouble if someone blocked him in the crevice.

When he quietly emerged from the exit onto the surface, the vicinity was quiet. But the depths of the mountains were incredibly lively, with figures on many mountaintops gazing at the increasingly astonishing and magnificent spectacle.

The five-colored mist and the ten pillars of light had actually intertwined. Qin Ming moved silently through the dense forest, then buried himself in a snowdrift.

He then began to examine the stone. Circulating the 'New Life Method' recorded on the silk scroll, his flesh rippled with fragmented golden patterns, and he began to peel the stone by hand.

Although the stone's skin was very hard, he silently crushed it, peeling it off efficiently.

Qin Ming continued to work. He felt the stone shrink by two circles, and at the same time, through his special perception, he found its fluctuations had slightly strengthened.

He paused. If he peeled it open completely, would some abnormal phenomenon occur?

After all, although this item was not as spectacular as the two treasures everyone was eyeing, it was definitely not ordinary.

At this moment, Qin Ming felt like a hundred claws were scratching his heart; he desperately wanted to cut the stone open completely, but he was afraid of accidentally causing trouble.
