# Chapter 31: The Storage Pouch

Shopkeeper Tian meticulously inspected the spirit talismans. After a moment, once the spiritual tea was served, he politely asked, “Fellow Daoist Mo, is this your first time visiting our pavilion?”

“Shopkeeper Tian indeed possesses keen insight. It is true, I am a first-time visitor, introduced by a friend,” Han Zhen replied, lowering his voice slightly.

“Many thanks to Fellow Daoist Mo’s friend for speaking highly of our pavilion. I assure you, this transaction will leave you satisfied.” Shopkeeper Tian was even happier to hear that Han Zhen had come by word-of-mouth.

“If I can find a stable channel for cooperation at a reasonable price, I would much rather not waste time hawking wares outdoors and needlessly increase my risks.”

“Throughout the entire cultivation world of the Yue Kingdom, our pavilion’s reputation is second to none. You can conduct your transactions with complete peace of mind,” Shopkeeper Tian seemed immensely proud of Myriad Treasures Pavilion’s reputation.

Shopkeeper Tian leaned back in his chair and lifted the lid of his teacup. An elegant tea fragrance instantly filled the room. Han Zhen could even detect a faint spiritual energy within the aroma.

“This is our pavilion’s specially prepared Azure Cloud Tea, unavailable anywhere else. Fellow Daoist Mo, please have a taste first,” Shopkeeper Tian took a small sip and said with a smile.

Han Zhen pushed the spiritual tea aside, closing the lids of the two brocade boxes. His tone carried a hint of urgency, “Shopkeeper Tian, let’s discuss business first.”

“Of course, of course.” Shopkeeper Tian put down his teacup and straightened up, a trace of apology on his face.

“For low-tier Spirit Quieting Talismans, our pavilion acquires them at a price of fifteen spirit stones for ten talismans. As for mid-tier Vajra Talismans, they are nine spirit stones each.”

“I wonder if Fellow Daoist Mo is satisfied with these prices?” Shopkeeper Tian gently stroked the teacup lid, offering his quote.

The price for the Vajra Talismans seemed reasonable, but the Spirit Quieting Talismans were clearly undervalued by about thirty percent. Han Zhen deliberated, not immediately agreeing.

Instead, he continued, “If I can provide a stable supply, would it be possible to raise the price next time?”

“Fellow Daoist Mo, you may not know this, but many cultivators can draw low-tier talismans themselves. If we were to buy them at the market price, our pavilion might incur losses,” Shopkeeper Tian shook his head and said.

“Shopkeeper Tian, you’re not being honest. My friend is a Talisman Master, and drawing spirit talismans is not as simple as you make it sound.” Han Zhen retrieved his brocade boxes, making as if to stand up and leave.

At this, Shopkeeper Tian quickly pressed down on the brocade boxes and spoke with a very sincere tone, “Fellow Daoist Mo, don’t be so hasty. Business is all about negotiation.”

“Since your friend is an esteemed Talisman Master, then I won’t resort to business trickery with you, brother. If you can provide no less than this many spirit talismans every month from now on, I guarantee a fair price!” Shopkeeper Tian gestured with a number.

The quantity he indicated was a bit more than a normal Talisman Master’s output but still within a reasonable range. He was likely testing the capabilities of Han Zhen’s non-existent friend.

Han Zhen then relaxed and sat back down, picking up the teacup and taking a small sip, pressing the lid against it.

The tea was fragrant and full-bodied upon entry, and a surge of spiritual energy entered his body. Clearly, this was a spiritual tea of no small value.

“Then, as Shopkeeper Tian says, a pleasant cooperation!”

Han Zhen placed the brocade boxes back on the table. Just as Shopkeeper Tian was about to pat his waist to retrieve the spirit stones, Han Zhen suddenly spoke, “Does Myriad Treasures Pavilion have ten-fold storage pouches for sale?”

A ten-fold storage pouch was already the most basic storage magic tool in the cultivation world.

“Of course, we do. The price is fair, only thirty spirit stones.”

Upon hearing this, Han Zhen was surprised it was so cheap, so he bought two immediately.

His future transactions would only involve more and more spirit stones; he couldn't possibly carry a large bag everywhere he went. Wouldn't that be openly declaring himself a fat sheep?

Moreover, Han Li surely carried many elixirs and even thousand-year spiritual herbs that shouldn't be easily shown to others. Giving one to him later would be a favor done naturally.

Han Zhen had considered his relationship with Han Li for a long time. Rather than continuing to hide things, it would be better to find an opportunity to confide some secrets in each other.

For a person cultivating the Dao to ultimately achieve fruition, they must satisfy four conditions: Technique, Location, Resources, and Companion.

Han Zhen and Han Li cooperating together would clearly yield a result greater than the sum of their individual parts.

Finally, after purchasing the storage pouches, Han Zhen also bought a portion of the spiritual tea from Shopkeeper Tian. From now on, he would also need something presentable to entertain guests.

He didn’t buy talisman-making materials at Myriad Treasures Pavilion. Han Zhen was worried about his unusually high success rate in drawing talismans being noticed, so he needed to be cautious.

Shopkeeper Tian had a servant bring the items Han Zhen requested, then said thoughtfully, “Fellow Daoist Mo, this must be your first time using a storage pouch, correct? Allow me to demonstrate.”

Shopkeeper Tian unceremoniously picked up a ten-fold storage pouch, demonstrating and explaining as he went, “Simply point the mouth of the pouch at the item you wish to store, then infuse some spiritual energy into the pouch, lock onto the item, and it will automatically be absorbed.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a white light flashed from the cloth pouch in Shopkeeper Tian’s hand, and a beam of light shot out from its mouth, enveloping all the items Han Zhen had purchased, as well as over a hundred spirit stones. Those items rapidly shrunk within the white light.

Once they had shrunk to a certain size, they were sucked into the pouch. Han Zhen watched from the side, quite moved; this was a scene he had fantasized about many times in his previous life.

“The method for retrieving items is the same: just use spiritual energy to lock onto the item inside the pouch.” Shopkeeper Tian tossed the storage pouch, and Han Zhen caught it steadily in his hand.

“Before Fellow Daoist Mo attempts this, there are a few taboos you must remember. First, a storage pouch has limits on capacity and shrinking magnification.”

“Second, a storage pouch absolutely cannot hold living creatures.”

“Third, and most importantly, low-tier storage pouches cannot be bound to their owner. Fellow Daoist Mo must guard it carefully, and it’s best not to reveal it easily to others!”

Shopkeeper Tian seemed not to want this cooperative channel with Han Zhen to encounter any issues, warning him earnestly.

Han Zhen naturally committed these words to memory. In the future, if he was ever forced to kill someone and seize their treasures, he must remember to search their corpse for a storage pouch.

“The first step to earning spirit stones has finally succeeded!”

Although Han Zhen had consistently referred to "a friend" throughout, Shopkeeper Tian was a shrewd individual and most certainly would have guessed that Han Zhen himself was the Talisman Master.

However, in order to maintain the initiative in the transaction, a moderate exposure of a bit of his strength was acceptable.

By providing a stable supply of talismans, the pavilion would also profit greatly when the Mount Tainan Fair arrived. Coupled with Myriad Treasures Pavilion’s reputation, Han Zhen felt that there was no impropriety.

Han Zhen carefully tucked the storage pouch into his embrace, his heart filled with joy, yet his face showed a hint of disappointment as he walked out of Myriad Treasures Pavilion.

He wound through the plaza, turning and circling for a while, and after confirming that no one was following him, he returned to the rented attic.

Like a child with a new toy, he took out the storage pouch and repeatedly tried to use it, playing with it many times. Only then did he store all his possessions inside.

Afterward, Han Zhen returned to his happy routine of cultivating the Evergreen Arts and drawing spirit talismans.

Cultivation was not boring at all!

During this time, Han Zhen attempted to draw a Voice Transmission Talisman and succeeded on his second try.

He guessed that auxiliary-type talisman arts were considerably easier to cultivate.

“At this moment, Han Li must still be cultivating in seclusion within the Seven Mysteries Sect,” Han Zhen thought. With this in mind, he used a channel within Tainan Valley to send a flying letter, along with a Voice Transmission Talisman.

In the letter, he informed Han Li about the situation in Tainan Valley and the cultivation method for voice transmission art.

Cultivation knows no time, and in the blink of an eye, less than a year remained until the Mount Tainan Fair.

Han Zhen successfully cultivated the Evergreen Arts to the tenth layer, full circle, without using any elixirs.

During this period, his success rate in drawing spirit talismans was too high, so Han Zhen had to seek out Han Yunzhi to help him sell a portion, promising to share some of the spirit stones with her.

Their relationship grew increasingly close. However, her elder brother remained in seclusion and had not emerged, which Han Zhen found quite regrettable.

One day, Han Zhen was studying a newly acquired high-tier talisman art when suddenly, a Voice Transmission Talisman flew before him.

Han Zhen took it and listened, his expression subtly changing.

“Is Daoist Qingwen still thinking about me?”
