# Chapter 554: The Time Has Come

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred.

It was effective!

Although the attribute panel indicated that comprehension was difficult, as long as he continued to comprehend, it was only a matter of time before he achieved initial mastery. Even without cultivating this secret technique previously, just some superficial applications had already allowed him to feel its sharpness.

Immediately, he put down the leather scroll and picked up the ink-black jade slip that contained the *Sun and Moon Profound Pivot*.

His spiritual sense probed into it, and a vast will of yin-yang rotation and the alternation of sun and moon washed over him. The immense and pure true meaning began to continuously...

*You begin to comprehend the Sun and Moon Profound Pivot. This method is grand and majestic, tempering the foundation of your physical body and soul. You perceive its subtleties. Proficiency +3.*

At the summit of the Divine Thunder Peak, inside the meditation chamber.

Xu Yunfan would occasionally close his eyes in comprehension, rubbing his fingertips together, causing electricity to stir in the void as a strange light of erosion flickered between his fingers.

At other times, his aura would surge, a luster of gold and jade flowing faintly beneath his skin. During the day, a phantom of a scorching sun seemed to shine upon him, while at night, the radiance of stars and the moon descended.

The rumble of Divine Thunder gradually merged with it, forming a peculiar resonance. The thick cloud qi accumulated within the *Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra* was continuously mobilized, pouring into his physical body to provide an endless stream of pure energy for the *Sun and Moon Profound Pivot*, while also continuously evolving the intricate structures and changes of the cloud talisman runes.

The *Sun and Moon Profound Pivot* required drawing upon the power of the sun and moon to temper the self. The cloud qi of the Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries could absorb the essence of the sun and moon. After all, artifact refining required more than just spiritual power; it also involved various elemental forces, and the essence of the sun and moon was naturally among them.

Four top-tier true arts and secret techniques, under the command of his Dao Foundation and attribute panel, advanced simultaneously in a mutually reinforcing and astonishingly synergistic manner.

On the vision panel, aside from the slowly climbing proficiency of the *Nether Erosion Heaven Talisman* and the *Sun and Moon Profound Pivot*, the proficiency number in parentheses after the *Divine Thunder Nine Firmaments Immovable True Sutra* was also slowly but steadily approaching 1000.

As for the *Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra*, it had long since reached Great Perfection. Advancing to the Perfection level required five thousand proficiency points, and it would be a long time before he could max it out.

*[You have gained insight while comprehending the Nether Erosion Heaven Talisman. Proficiency +2]*
*[You visualize the sun and moon, drawing upon solar essence to temper your body. Proficiency of the Sun and Moon Profound Pivot +1]*
*[The Mysterious Capital cloud qi within your body nourishes your bones and promotes the circulation of the Sun and Moon Profound Pivot. Proficiency +1]*
*[...]*

*[The foundation of the Divine Thunder Nine Firmaments Immovable True Sutra is stable, drawing upon a thread of Divine Thunder true meaning. Proficiency +2]*

The information prompts on the attribute panel kept jumping.

The price paid was merely a few months of seclusion and cultivation.

With the attribute panel pushing his proficiency forward, the connection between Xu Yunfan and the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit, suspended high above the nine heavens, was also becoming clearer and clearer, silently and imperceptibly.

On this day, after finishing his cultivation, Xu Yunfan's mind stirred slightly. A trace of an extremely subtle thought operated quietly in the depths of his sea of consciousness.

His clone, Han Shi, in the Divine Martial World, was deeply immersed in the comprehension of the *Myriad Chariot Sword Art*.

An imperceptible "sensation of epiphany," as if originating from the deepest recesses of his own sword heart's intuition, descended quietly, startling him from his meditation.

Han Shi, his head full of white hair and his appearance withered, suddenly raised his head. A long-absent sharp light and uncontrollable excitement erupted from his turbid eyes.

He had long since refined his sword intent to the realm of the "Heart Sword." His will was pure and sharp, like a sword heart that was clear and bright. In terms of sword Dao realm alone, he was comparable to a cultivator at the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation.

Relying on the slightly faster flow of time in the Divine Martial World compared to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, he could be invincible among his peers with his sword intent alone.

However, the spiritual qi of the Divine Martial World was as thin as a wasteland. Although his realm was sufficient, the true qi accumulated within his body was like a trickling stream, pitifully scarce. He possessed the realm but struggled to climb to higher peaks.

But it was precisely this century of hardship in a land devoid of spiritual qi that acted like the harshest whetstone, honing his will and sword intent to be even purer and more transparent.

Every wisp of essence qi that dissipated, every torment of his lifespan nearing its end, transformed into a cold gleam on his sword's edge.

"The space is trembling!"

Han Shi's emaciated fingers subconsciously clenched, sensing the extremely subtle yet undeniably real distortion of the entire Divine Martial World.

"The hundred-year period has come again. The world's qi is pulling into chaos. It should be that the Taihua Spirit Ruins World has cycled once, creating a rift. It must be an exit. As long as I find it, I can leave this wretched place."

This world was in an almost post-ancient era. Even if spiritual qi were to recover, it would take three to four hundred years. By then, he would be a pile of withered bones.

He no longer hesitated. His emaciated body erupted with power that belied his appearance as he suddenly rose from his seated position on the stone platform, his posture still as straight as a sword.

He had endured nearly a century of hardship here, his hair and beard turned white, his lifespan nearly exhausted.

If he could not find an opportunity to break free and locate the path to Foundation Establishment, he would truly become a handful of loess in this barren realm, a century of sword Dao cultivation completely wasted.

Following the faint pull from the spatial tremors, Han Shi transformed into a dim yet sharp sword light, braving the invisible stagnation pressure of the realm, and rapidly traversed the desolate land.

After rushing for over a hundred miles, ahead in his vision, within the deep and dark void, a pitch-black crack, like a hideous wound, flickered in and out of existence, appearing and disappearing amidst the spatial ripples.

"Found it! The heavens have not forsaken me!"

Seeing this, Han Shi's expression shook violently, his beard trembling with excitement.

This confirmed his suspicions. Every hundred years, the Divine Martial World would experience a brief but intense spatial tremor due to the qi pull from its superior realm, the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

This crack was the only window to a path of survival and hope.

In this moment of life and death, there was no room for hesitation.

He let out a low roar suppressed for nearly a century and, without a shred of fear, poured all his remaining power into the sword light beneath his feet. Like a moth drawn to a flame, he charged headfirst into that twisting and shifting pitch-black crack.

*Pfft!*

It felt as if he had pierced through a sticky, resilient membrane. An intense sensation of spatial tearing enveloped his entire body.

The next moment, an indescribable, suffocatingly rich vitality, carrying天地靈氣 so pure it made every pore in his body cry out in delight, like a flood that had been积蓄 for ten thousand years, instantly submerged him completely.

"Ugh!"

A groan, half in pain and half in ecstasy, escaped Han Shi's throat.

His body, which had been like a dried-up well, suddenly transformed into the greediest of "sponges," instinctively and frantically absorbing the surging spiritual qi of heaven and earth.

His meridians were reviving, his dried-up dantian sea was greedily gulping it down, and his withered flesh and blood, under the scouring of the pure spiritual qi, trembled with a joyous agony that was on the verge of breaking.

This spiritual qi tide seemed to last for an unknown duration before Han Shi finally stopped his near-plunderous absorption.

He stood firm in the void, sensing the unprecedented sense of immense power and the full vitality within him. A powerful tremor from his narrow escape from death struck his heart and mind.
