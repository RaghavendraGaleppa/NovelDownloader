# Chapter 59: Gilded Cudgel

Xu Yunfan’s expression shifted upon hearing the words.

Before Xu Yunfan could speak, Lu Yi spoke first.

“There are more and more martial artists in Beiye City lately. Have you noticed?”

“I’ve been practicing martial arts at home these past few days. Even my meals are delivered by Changfeng Tavern. I rarely go out.”

Xu Yunfan answered casually, then asked with some curiosity, “Are there really many martial artists in Beiye City recently?”

“They’re practically crowding the streets. If you go out for a look, two or three out of ten people are carrying swords or sabers. The taverns in the city are packed to the brim. These martial artists draw their blades and start fighting at the drop of a hat. The thirteen shopkeepers of the West Market’s Wine Flags have all set up iron birch shields behind their counters. The day before yesterday, two burly men wielding斩马刀 (Zhan Ma Dao / Horse-chopping Sabers) fought fiercely at Changfeng Tavern. A beam as thick as a bowl’s mouth was snapped in half, and the entire second floor has collapsed! It’s too much of a disturbance. It was only when City Prefect Jiang Huaisheng ordered the Chief Commander to lead troops to guard the area that things settled down.”

“No wonder someone was peeking over the wall while I was practicing the other day. I thought it was just a neighbor, so I didn’t pay it any mind.”

Xu Yunfan stroked his chin thoughtfully and continued to ask.

“Did something happen? If it weren’t for something good, these so-called martial heroes wouldn’t have come running, right?”

Lu Yi chuckled. “Naturally. These people who roam the martial world have noses sharper than dogs. They come rushing over at the slightest scent of blood.”

He paused, took a bite of a dish, and said leisurely, “The Hu family was the first to spread the news. A master on Jiyun Mountain achieved a martial death, leaving behind a divine weapon. Because of an earthquake, the cave where he died was revealed. They say it’s the remains of the Grand General who guarded the north from the previous dynasty. He’s clutching a Gilded Cudgel in his embrace, and the残甲 (residual armor) pierced by the cudgel’s tip is still dripping blood. When the divine weapon saw the light of day, a brilliance shot straight up to the Bull’s Head constellation, scattering across the mountain streams. It was spotted by several families in the city, and the rumors spread quickly. Now that the snow has melted and the cave has reappeared, naturally the entire Qingzhou martial world is rushing over at the news.”

At this point, a mocking smile appeared on Lu Yi’s face.

“Most of those people are just cannon fodder. Do you think a divine weapon is so easily obtained? The people in storytelling tales who obtain a divine weapon and soar to the heavens—most of them can’t even endure the backlash from the weapon’s spirit. They can’t even hold onto their own life force, which gets completely drained away.”

“That sinister?” This was the first time Xu Yunfan had heard of such a thing; Li Haoming had never mentioned it.

“A divine weapon is a divine weapon. How can it be compared to ordinary things?”

Lu Yi sighed and looked up at the slightly overcast clouds in the sky. “Times have changed. Only sects with a long history, like the Divine Weapon Ridge, know this clearly. Now, the thread of hope lies with the divine weapons, but…”

He shook his head. “They are extremely sinister. To forge a divine weapon, a human sacrifice is required to give it spirit. Only weapons with spirit can be called divine weapons. It is difficult for ordinary people to get close. Once the blade is unsheathed, even standing slightly nearby can injure people.”

Xu Yunfan was astonished. He had never imagined that a mere weapon could possess such power. He asked repeatedly about the characteristics of divine weapons, and Lu Yi answered each question.

Drinking to his heart’s content with Lu Yi, Xu Yunfan rarely got a little drunk.

After the dishes had been tasted and the wine had gone around three times, looking at Lu Yi’s nose, which had turned red from the alcohol,

Xu Yunfan fell silent for a moment, then spoke. “Once the winter snow melts and disappears, I plan to leave Beiye City to find a sect and become a disciple.”

Lu Yi’s expression shifted slightly. He glanced at Xu Yunfan and nodded slightly.

“That’s right. You’re still young; you need to go out and see more, to make your way in the world… But you’re bringing existing skills to seek apprenticeship. You might be viewed with suspicion. You’re a martial arts master now, right?”

“I’ve completed the Muscle and Skin stage and have just entered Bone Training. I can be considered a second-level martial arts master.”

As Lu Yi spoke, he picked up a piece of braised beef. Hearing Xu Yunfan’s words, his hand trembled, and his expression was one of disbelief as he exclaimed, “You’ve completed the second stage?!”

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, his expression calm. But seeing the disbelief on the old man’s face, looking as if he thought Xu Yunfan was talking nonsense or had gone crazy, he felt a little smug inside.

“I don’t believe it!”

Seeing Lu Yi’s firm statement, Xu Yunfan fell silent for a moment. He raised his arm, and the originally quiet blood and Qi within him surged instantly, filling his arm.

In an instant, blue veins bulged all over his arm, like green pythons coiling around it. His originally sturdy arm expanded at a terrifying speed, and the knotted muscle bundles twisted around each other like giant pythons.

The subcutaneous blood vessels turned into indigo vines, creating deep grooves on the surface of the bulging muscles. The circumference of the muscles expanded several levels beyond the original arm, as if a deformed arm had grown.

*Hum!*

A sound of a large tendon snapping, like a full moon bending a bow, carried an unparalleled sense of immense power that accumulated rapidly.

Then, at the peak of congestion, the palm, which was now bright red, fell like a fan onto the stone stool beside him.

The entire movement was silent. But when Xu Yunfan moved his hand away, a clear palm print was visible on the stone stool, sinking three inches deep, with smooth and round edges.

Seeing this scene, Lu Yi almost jumped up. The drunkenness on his face was scared away by several points. The veins in his neck throbbed, and his murky eyes almost bulged out of his wrinkled eyelids.

A piece of beef *plopped* into the wine cup, splashing droplets of wine.

“The sound of the tendon snapping like a bowstring, the skin tough enough to shake a drum—both Muscle and Skin are at the second stage! Both fully completed!!”

Lu Yi’s thin fingers dug deeply into the edge of the table, and the stone table made a creaking friction sound as if it was being clawed. He stared at the youth’s muscular, knotted arm, his Adam’s apple bobbing three times before he squeezed out a voice.

“How old are you?”

“Twenty-one this year.”

Lu Yi sat down again, organizing his words, his expression full of complexity.

“With your talent, this place is indeed too small. A shallow pool cannot raise a true dragon.”

He slowly stood up, pacing back and forth with his hands behind his back for a long time. Finally, he made up his mind and took out a palm-sized black iron token from his chest.

Lu Yi caressed the token in his hand with a nostalgic look and sighed. “If I were still at Divine Weapon Ridge, I would at least be a master weapon forger by now.”

With that, he threw the token made of black iron to Xu Yunfan.

“Catch.”

Xu Yunfan took it and looked. The black iron token was carved with cloud patterns, with swords and blades intertwined, and the words “Divine Weapon” carved in the center.

“This is the token of Divine Weapon Ridge. If, if…”

Lu Yi’s expression was hesitant, but he finally said, “If other sects do not accept you, you can take this token to Divine Weapon Ridge. But I must remind you, Divine Weapon Ridge has been half-collapsed since someone smashed the mountain. It is not what it used to be. With your talent, think it over carefully.”

Xu Yunfan nodded seriously. “Thank you, Elder Lu.”

Lu Yi seemed to recall the past, waved his hand, turned around, and slowly walked out the door.

“Alright, I also cherish talent. These days, I’ve been able to see a person clearly. Although you are naturally cold, you value promises and keep your word. You are a good talent for the martial world. Don’t join the excitement about that so-called appearance of a divine weapon. If it’s real, those below the Flesh Refining realm are just cannon fodder, losing their lives for nothing. Besides, true or false, who knows if it’s a trap?”

“I understand.”

For the next few days, Xu Yunfan basically stayed indoors, silently practicing the Iron Bridge Suppressing the Pass Bone Training Chapter.
