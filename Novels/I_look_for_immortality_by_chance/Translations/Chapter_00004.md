# Chapter 4: Flame Dragon and Fire  

"Boom!"  

Blistering heat surged from outside the demonic cavern as a deafening dragon's roar shook the heavens and earth.  

The Demonic Fiend Sect had evidently provoked some formidable enemy. The colossal fire dragon, its eyes blazing like golden flames, swept through the battlefield with overwhelming arrogance. The terrifying heat seemed capable of boiling seas and scorching mountains.  

Even the Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Demonic Fiend Sect were powerless to stop the dragon's advance, forced into retreat.  

"Enough, Flame Dragonzi!"  

"Will you not retreat? Do you truly believe the Demonic Fiend Sect is made of clay? If you dare press further, do you not fear the wrath of our sect master?"  

One of the Demonic Fiend Sect's Foundation Establishment cultivators roared in fury as he desperately tried to hold back the dragon's onslaught.  

"Wrath? After today, the Demonic Fiend Sect will cease to exist!"  

From atop the fire dragon, an elder with an azure jade hairpin and billowing sleeves spoke in an icy voice, his demeanor ethereal and immortal-like.  

Hearing this, the Demonic Fiend Sect cultivator's face twisted in horror.  

He immediately formed hand seals and chanted an incantation. A green bird-shaped talisman seal materialized above his right hand, as if summoning something—but no response came.  

His face turned deathly pale. Without hesitation, he raised his hand, conjuring another seal, this one square-shaped with a black bat circling ominously.  

"Screech!"  

As the seal appeared, an eerie, soundless wave rippled through the air, carrying a terrifying, soul-shaking roar.  

"Bang!"  

The elder atop the fire dragon stiffened momentarily, his expression blank as if stunned.  

But above his head, a jade-green lotus seal manifested on its own, releasing a faint, soothing fragrance. The elder inhaled deeply, and within moments, his clarity returned.  

Yet, in that brief moment, the Demonic Fiend Sect cultivator had already mounted a black bronze mirror and fled north at breakneck speed.  

"Stop him!"  

Just then, a large group of cultivators clad in crimson robes appeared outside the cavern, each wielding formation flags. They swiftly set up a grand array to block his escape.  

But the Demonic Fiend Sect cultivator merely snorted. The black mirror erupted with countless beams of demonic light, shredding the formation apart as he vanished into the northern horizon.  

"Uncle-Master, we have failed! The Worm Daoist escaped!"  

A burly disciple in his thirties with a square jaw hurriedly bowed to the elder above.  

"No matter. I never intended to keep him here. That old fox has too many tricks up his sleeve. Killing him would require at least two Foundation Establishment cultivators."  

"Right now, both our Flame Dragon Sect and the Heavenly Origin Sect are besieging the Demonic Fiend Sect's mountain gate. I provoked him deliberately to make him abandon the Demon Star Cavern sooner. That way, we can plunder its treasures before the Heavenly Origin Sect arrives. Otherwise, once the Demonic Fiend Sect falls, we'd have to split the spoils equally."  

The elder waved dismissively.  

"Uncle-Master is wise!"  

The burly disciple's eyes lit up in realization.  

This mission was about seizing wealth behind their allies' backs, not about killing.  

"Enough talk. Enter the mine immediately and gather every last Demon Star Stone. Leave nothing behind. Then spread the word that it was the Worm Daoist who took them."  

The elder issued swift orders.  

"Yes, Uncle-Master!"  

The disciple bowed, but then hesitated. "Uncle-Master, there are still hundreds of Verdant Wood Sect disciples enslaved as miners inside. What should we do with them?"  

"What Verdant Wood Sect? That's the Verdant Wood Demon Sect!" The elder scoffed. "Victors write history. Do you expect us to restore their sect?"  

"Before the Heavenly Origin Sect arrives, transport all the miners to the Serpent Dragon Cave. If there isn't enough time, just kill them. We can't risk them leaking our presence and giving the Heavenly Origin Sect grounds to complain later."  

"Once the Demonic Fiend Sect is wiped out, we'll have hundreds of new miners anyway. There's no shortage of labor for the Demon Star Stones."  

With a wave of his hand, the elder sealed the fate of hundreds.  

The burly disciple shuddered inwardly.  

The Serpent Dragon Cave was a spiritual cavern within the Flame Dragon Sect, home to a stone serpent formed from natural earth veins. This serpent shed special "scales" that were prized materials for artifact forging.  

However, harvesting these scales was perilous—nine out of ten who attempted it died.  

When enraged, the stone serpent devoured people!  

Yet if cultivators of higher cultivation entered, the serpent would burrow into the earth veins and vanish. For years, the Flame Dragon Sect had resorted to capturing rogue cultivators to mine the scales.  

The Serpent Dragon Cave was even deadlier than the Demon Star Cavern. The disciple knew these miners wouldn't last long.  

But a thriving sect meant more resources for disciples like him, allowing further cultivation progress.  

With that thought, he said no more. Bowing once more, he led his fellow disciples into the cavern.  

As per his uncle-master's instructions, he had brought only the most loyal and ruthless among them.  

---  

"Brothers of the Flame Dragon Sect! We are disciples of the Verdant Wood Sect!"  

"Years ago, I visited the Flame Dragon Sect with my master. I believe we've met before!"  

"Uncle-Master Flame Dragon above—have you won? Can you release us?"  

The miners below, unaware of the conversation above, called out hopefully.  

But their pleas were met with cold indifference.  

Holding crimson lanterns that detected life force, the Flame Dragon Sect disciples swiftly located every miner. With a flick of their spiritual power, they knocked them unconscious and loaded them onto flying vessels.  

"What are you doing?!"  

"The Flame Dragon Sect is also under the Heavenly Court's jurisdiction! How dare you act like this?!"  

"Aren't you afraid of the Heavenly Court's inspectors?!"  

As time passed, some realized something was amiss and shouted in protest.  

But the Flame Dragon Sect showed no mercy, striking them down without hesitation, treating them like livestock.  

Those with higher cultivation or knowledge of the truth fled deeper into the cavern, hoping the demonic miasma would shield them from the lanterns' detection.  

But it was futile.  

Without the ability to channel spiritual power or activate talismans, they were no different from mortals—how could they outrun cultivators?  

Within half an incense stick's time, most of the miners had been captured.  

---  

Deep within the cavern, in the darkness, a pair of eyes stared fixedly at an emerald-green token.  

"Almost there... just a little more!"  

Gu Yuan could sense an immense, surging power within the token—like a cannonball ready to fire, searing and unstoppable.  

This power far surpassed that of the Verdant Wood Sect's master, who was at the late Foundation Establishment stage.  

But the token was ensnared by a web of gray mist, sealing the power within, cutting it off from the world's spiritual energy.  

Like a cannon's fuse that had been stomped out mid-burn.  

Fortunately, after countless years, the gray mist had weakened to its limit.  

One final push would shatter it.  

Hearing the commotion above, Gu Yuan ignored the agony in his organs, channeling every last drop of his spiritual energy to ignite a feeble flame at his fingertip.  

The flame flickered weakly, barely illuminating his ashen face in the darkness.  

Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead.  

His body trembled violently, his lips quivering uncontrollably.  

His organs bled, his meridians felt flayed, and the bones in his wrist had shattered. The pain was unbearable, threatening to shatter his mind.  

His vision blurred, consciousness slipping.  

"Pah!"  

Biting his tongue hard, he tasted blood, forcing himself to stay focused.  

"It's too late. The Heavenly Origin Sect's cultivators are arriving. Kill the rest and leave!"  

The elder's cold voice echoed outside.  

With a wave of his hand, countless black beams of demonic light shot into the cavern like arrows of death.  

His technique was eerily similar to the Worm Daoist's.  

---  

Screams erupted in the darkness.  

"Whoosh!"  

The black beams streaked toward the cavern's depths.  

Gu Yuan sensed the surge of spiritual energy and the whistling of the approaching attack.  

A beam of darkness shot straight for his forehead—inches away.  

Death loomed.  

But at that moment, his trembling right hand, holding the flickering flame, finally touched the gray mist.  

The mist, which had endured for untold years, shattered.  

The feeble flame reignited the cannon's fuse.  

"BOOM!"  

A terrifying force erupted, illuminating the cavern in blinding light.
