# Chapter 3: Lure

The excitement faded as Jiang Li soon noticed a sticky sensation all over his body. This was the first time he had practiced martial arts after taking the Body Strengthening Pill, resulting in a large amount of impurities being expelled. While it might not have reached the level of marrow cleansing, it certainly left him feeling significantly lighter after purging the toxins.

"I definitely need a bath now."

Jiang Li wrinkled his nose at his own stench. He retrieved a change of clothes from his bag—fortunately, no one had stolen these items. Slipping out of the carriage, he found the surroundings eerily quiet. Only two black-clad martial artists sat by the campfire on night watch, while everyone else slept soundly in their tents.

Treading lightly, Jiang Li headed toward the small river—the same one where he had secretly watched Yan Fengyue bathe. The guards by the fire noticed his departure but paid no mind, merely poking at the flames.

"Those brats never listen when we tell them not to leave camp. Tsk, our job is to guard the camp. If they die outside, it's their own fault."

Unaware of the guards' complaints, Jiang Li cast Appraisal spells into the dark bushes as he walked. Names of plants and insects he'd never heard of—White Ghost Needle Grass, Springblood Thorn Vine, Riverside Willow—popped up one after another. He ignored them; at his current Appraisal level, even a rare treasure right in front of him might go unnoticed.

Occasionally, yellow or red appraisal frames appeared from the undergrowth, revealing venomous snakes or scorpions. Spotting these, Jiang Li calmly changed course. The large predators in the area had already been turned into roasted meat during the day, leaving these poisonous critters and plants as the main nighttime hazards. As long as he was careful with his Appraisal skill, safety was relatively assured—which was why he dared to venture out alone.

Upon reaching the river, he spammed Appraisal spells into the water to confirm it was safe before stripping off his dirty clothes and using a ladle to wash away the grime.

Back in the carriage, Jiang Li, still riding the high of his earlier success, quickly resumed his training. The Sleeping Tiger stance of the Year Tiger Art allowed him to practice even while asleep. Though the progress was slow, its advantage lay in its steady accumulation and the ability to remain alert during sleep—a unique feature of this otherwise mediocre martial art.

Soon, the sound of snoring filled the carriage, as if a real tiger had curled up inside.

Several days later.

Swish!

A figure darted through the forest, accelerating to top speed before suddenly swinging a sword.

The figure brushed past a thick tree, a flash of sword light streaking through the air. Moments later, the tree—wider than Yan Hong's head—slowly toppled over.

Clap! Clap! Clap!

Yan Hong, with his round, chubby face, applauded as he approached, examining the clean cut on the tree with admiration. "Incredible! Absolutely incredible! Your Mountain-Splitting Sword grows more formidable with each strike. I take back what I said about sparring with you—I don’t want to be on the receiving end of that."

He patted the soft armor he wore, which clearly wouldn’t withstand such a blow. "Jiang Li, your Year Tiger Art has advanced by leaps and bounds, and your Mountain-Splitting Sword is fearsome. In the martial world, many second-rate fighters wouldn’t stand a chance against you."

"But the Wang and Li family brats—they’re not even as strong as I am. How did they manage to beat you so badly?"

Yan Hong vividly remembered Jiang Li’s battered state from days ago—it was a miracle he’d survived. Naturally, he was puzzled.

"What could I do? I didn’t have my sword, and they ambushed me from behind, knocking me out with a rock. Otherwise, as a martial arts family’s heir, how could I lose to them?" Jiang Li pointed to the back of his head, where the massive bruise had been clear evidence of the fatal blow to his former self.

"Just wait till I get my chance. Hmph! I’ll beat the shit out of them! When have I ever been bullied like this in my life?"

His face twisted with anger, perfectly portraying a thirteen-year-old boy thirsting for revenge.

Yan Hong had no doubts. In the martial kingdom of Hongyan, everyone from nobles to young ladies dabbled in martial arts if they had the means. Jiang Li, as the heir of a martial family, was expected to know some skills, even if he’d been somewhat unreliable in the past.

"Don’t worry, brother. With your strength, as long as they don’t ambush you, ten or eight of them wouldn’t stand a chance."

"And don’t worry about the immortal leading the group. No one cared when they beat you half to death last time. As long as you don’t kill anyone in plain sight, no one will bat an eye."

Yan Hong patted Jiang Li’s shoulder excitedly, as if he were the one seeking revenge.

Jiang Li chuckled, then glanced at the sword in his hand. "Uh… Yan Hong, I’ll pay you back when we reach town."

He sheepishly handed the sword back. The blade was now riddled with nicks and chips, its edges repeatedly rolled and reground until it was barely functional—clearly on its last legs.

"Damn… you’ve got some insane strength. Whatever, consider it a gift. What are brothers for? Just promise you’ll get me a better one later."

Yan Hong stroked the battered blade mournfully. Weapons mixed with black iron weren’t easy to come by—even his princely household only had this one.

"Definitely, definitely. I’ll just sharpen this one and use it a bit longer."

Jiang Li found a stone to grind the sword. The two chatted idly near the camp. Silently summoning his status panel, a screen flashed before his eyes:

**[Name: Jiang Li]**  
**[Age: 13]**  
**[Race: Human]**  
**[Main Class: Martial Artist, Tier: Second-Rate]**  
**[Subclass 1: None]**  
**[Subclass 2: None]**  
**[HP: 540/540]**  
**[Stamina: 420/420]**  
**[Strength: 2.1]**  
**[Speed: 2.0]**  
**[Constitution: 2.3]**  
**[Spirit: 1.0]**  
**[Comprehension: 1.5]**  
**[Skills: Year Tiger Art Lv.5, Appraisal Lv.2, Mountain-Splitting Sword Lv.3]**  
**[Buffs: Slow Healing, Satiated, Body Strengthening]**  
**[Debuffs: None]**  

His physical stats had now averaged above 2.0. While this might seem only twice that of an average adult, the reality was far greater. Higher stats provided exponential growth—though the difference wasn’t obvious now, once his attributes surpassed 100, each additional point might equal dozens at his current level.

Beyond stats, his Year Tiger Art had reached Lv.5 (Proficient), and his Mountain-Splitting Sword was now Lv.3 (Adept). For ordinary martial artists, reaching this level might take a decade of grueling training. Yet Jiang Li had achieved it in less than a week.

The credit lay primarily with the Body Strengthening Pill. Each pill lasted two hours, meaning Jiang Li had effectively consumed sixty to seventy of these rare pills in a short span—an impossible feat for most.

What he didn’t know was that even immortal-world pills had diminishing returns and toxicity. Most pills were most effective the first time, with diminishing effects upon repeated use. Moreover, increasing dosage to compensate was unwise due to pill toxicity. Thus, most cultivators, no matter how wealthy, couldn’t recklessly consume pills like candy.

Jiang Li had yet to realize that his cheat ability was far more potent than he imagined.

"Yan Hong, didn’t you train with a martial sect before? I heard immortals are strict about disciples with prior training. Would they reject someone like us?"

Jiang Li recalled Yan Hong’s immense grip strength—easily a 2.5 in stats—remarkable for a thirteen-year-old.

"Not training—my father hired a Blazing Sun Sect elder to teach me. It wasn’t for combat, though. Their techniques are said to… enhance virility."

"As for prior training, don’t overthink it. A bit of mortal martial arts means nothing to immortals. To them, we’re all just mortals anyway."

At the mention of immortals, Yan Hong’s eyes gleamed with longing. Who wouldn’t yearn for immortality?

"True. Even inner energy masters grovel before those immortals, more obsequious than my family’s servants."

Jiang Li sighed in agreement. Inner energy masters were formidable, capable of scaling walls and shattering stone—impressive, but still within human limits. With his Body Strengthening buff, Jiang Li could reach that level soon.

But immortals—or cultivators—were said to command storms and cleave mountains with their swords. Even with his modern knowledge, such power was hard to fathom. Their might transcended humanity, making martial arts trivial in comparison.

"Even innate masters are just servants to cultivators. So Jiang Li, train for fitness if you must, but focus on cultivation later. Fall behind, and I won’t wait for you."

Yan Hong’s chubby face twisted into an exaggerated, earnest expression, looking utterly ridiculous.

"Why do I still hear the nagging of etiquette matrons hundreds of miles from home? Yan Hong, are you sure you’re only thirteen?"

Jiang Li inspected the freshly sharpened sword, exasperated. Though no time-management expert, he was at least an adult in mind—he knew his priorities.

"Heh, I’ve driven off quite a few etiquette matrons in my princely household too."

"Say, Jiang Li, do you like Yan Fengyue? Why not try forcing yourself on her again? I’ll keep watch this time. Afterward, we’d be family."

Yan Hong’s eyes gleamed mischievously—quite a devious idea for someone with such a pudgy face.

"Get lost!"

The two roughhoused as they left the woods.

---

Another evening arrived—dinner time. Jiang Li queued for food as usual, but his peers deliberately isolated him, leaving gaps before and after him in line. It was like school bullying in his past life: targeting the weak to assert dominance, with insults, rumors, and even physical abuse serving as bonding rituals.

Most wouldn’t actively bully him, but neither would they offer help. An ordinary boy might’ve been driven to despair.

But Jiang Li wasn’t ordinary.

After collecting his food, he deliberately glanced fearfully at the boys behind him, then hurried away with his head down. In his "panic," he spilled his tray, "wiped tears" with his sleeve, grabbed a steamed bun from the ground, and bolted toward the distant woods—glancing back repeatedly at his bullies.

Why should you never turn your back on wild animals? Because predators instinctively can’t resist attacking a fleeing target. Combined with his terrified expression—signaling a victim who wouldn’t fight back—it was an irresistible lure for young bullies.

Sure enough, seven boys—three from the Wang family, four from the Li family, the same ones who’d beaten the original Jiang Li to death—exchanged glances. Some hadn’t even gotten their food yet, but the chance to vent was too tempting. They grabbed makeshift weapons and gave chase.

"Watch me—this time, I’ll break that Jiang kid’s legs!"

"Which ones?"

"Ha! All three!"

"Move, don’t let him escape!"

Still basking in their "heroic" rescue of Yan Fengyue, the boys snarled viciously. Jiang Li’s former self had been a bully, but these seven were no saints either. Chivalry? Nonsense—they just enjoyed violence and showing off.

Entering the woods, they soon spotted Jiang Li leaning against a crooked tree, smiling as he waited.

"Heh! Jiang Li, smart move—waiting for us like a good dog."

"Know what? We’ll go easy and only break two legs. But the middle one’s definitely done for!"

"Hahaha!"

The leader brandished a wooden club as the others fanned out, blocking escape routes.

Then—thud!

A figure flew five or six meters, landing motionless. Jiang Li had pulled a sword from behind the tree. Not intending to kill, he’d used the scabbard to send the boy flying.
