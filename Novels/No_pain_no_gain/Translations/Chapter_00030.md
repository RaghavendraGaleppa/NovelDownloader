# Chapter 30: Great Success

A quarter of an hour later, Han Zhen held a shimmering spiritual talisman and the Quieting Talisman he already possessed, meticulously comparing them. From their appearance, the two talismans looked identical. However, the spiritual essence of the one he had drawn was slightly fainter. Moments later, the spiritual power of this Quieting Talisman Han Zhen had drawn suddenly became chaotic, then spontaneously combusted in his hand, burning into ashes. Fortunately, Han Zhen promptly shielded his palm with spiritual energy, preventing the talisman's self-immolating flames from harming him.

Yet, it wasn't without gain. The moment the spiritual talisman was completed, all the thoughts and insights from this drawing experience integrated into his mind. Han Zhen felt he had grasped the knack. So he took another talisman paper and redrew it with his newfound understanding. This time, the spiritual talisman self-destructed during the incantation process. Han Zhen could sense it was due to uneven distribution of spiritual power in a few strokes of the runes. He took another blank talisman paper, then a fourth, a fifth... Each attempt brought new insights into his mind.

Finally, after wasting half a dozen talisman papers, his seventh attempt was a success! Not only did he successfully cast the spell by combining it with the incantation of the Quieting Art, but the spiritual power of this talisman was also considerably more abundant than the one he had seized from Doctor Mo. Among low-grade, elementary spiritual talismans, it could even be considered a masterpiece. Subsequently, he successfully drew five more in a row, and their quality showed a rising trend. Holding these six Quieting Talismans, Han Zhen couldn't help but exclaim joyfully in his heart, "The Heavenly Dao Rewards Diligence truly is terrifyingly potent!"

It was widely known that experienced, professional talisman crafters were extremely rare in the cultivation world, as training a qualified talisman crafter incurred significant costs. Only major cultivation sects like the Seven Great Sects possessed the resources to nurture them. For novices attempting to learn talisman crafting, failing hundreds of times consecutively during the drawing process was a common occurrence. Only after drawing a thousand times might their success rate gradually increase, and this was only if they specialized in a single type of spiritual talisman. A dozen blank talisman papers, twelve sheets in total, cost one spirit stone at the stalls. To proficiently learn how to draw one type of low-grade elementary spiritual talisman, the cost of blank talisman papers alone would amount to one hundred spirit stones. If one switched to another type of spiritual talisman, even with prior experience, the initial success rate would still be astonishingly low. Switching to crafting mid-grade talismans would incur even more staggering costs, difficult to bear even for the Seven Great Sects. Therefore, most spiritual talismans sold on the market were low-grade and mid-grade elementary ones. Higher-quality spiritual talismans were typically crafted by cultivators who specialized in talisman arts. In the following days, Han Zhen would complete his cultivation of the Evergreen Art each day, then proceed to draw talismans until his mental energy was exhausted.

Not only did Han Zhen not find it boring, but seeing the Quieting Talismans gradually pile up filled him with even more drive. Moreover, after so many days, Han Zhen even felt his spiritual consciousness had grown slightly. Finally, all ten dozen low-grade elementary talisman papers he had purchased were used up. Excluding unforeseen issues during the crafting process, he had successfully drawn not only 70 Quieting Talismans but also 15 mid-grade elementary Vajra Talismans! According to the prices at the stalls, selling all of them would yield a net profit of at least 250 spirit stones! Furthermore, the quality of the talismans he crafted was guaranteed, so their sales would definitely be better than those of other rogue cultivators. However, only Han Zhen could achieve such results. If everyone in the cultivation world could easily craft spiritual talismans, prices would have long since fallen into chaos.

"These are only low-grade and mid-grade elementary talismans," he mused. "Once my cultivation increases further, I can begin attempting high-grade elementary talismans." Han Zhen couldn't help but think of high-grade elementary offensive and defensive talismans, each worth dozens of spirit stones. If he could achieve such a success rate with them, he would never have to worry about spirit stones again. Once he earned enough spirit stones, after establishing his foundation, he could also dabble in alchemy, array formations, or even puppet arts. This would not only open up more avenues for wealth but also ensure he had no weaknesses. Of course, raising his cultivation remained the top priority. Han Zhen's stock of blank talisman paper and cinnabar had also run out. It was the perfect time to sell this batch of Quieting Talismans and purchase a new set of talisman crafting materials. With such a virtuous cycle, he should be able to amass a considerable fortune before the Tai'nan Minor Convention arrived.

"But how should I sell so many spiritual talismans?" Han Zhen pondered, holding a stack of talismans. If he were to set up a stall like other rogue cultivators, even if his talismans were of superior quality, it would still take considerable time to sell them all. Not only would it delay his cultivation, but during that time, he could have already crafted a new batch of talismans. Moreover, the public square was crowded and had many watchful eyes. Rashly displaying so many spiritual talismans carried the risk of attracting covetous gazes. "I could consider asking Sister Han Yunzhi to help sell a portion, just giving her a small share of the profit." If the quantity wasn't too large, she wouldn't risk being targeted either. Han Zhen considered this an option, assuming Han Yunzhi frequently set up a stall. "However, it would be much safer to sell the majority in batches to shops that purchase spiritual talismans." At the very least, these shops had extensive backgrounds and large businesses. A slightly larger quantity of low-grade elementary talismans wouldn't cause them to target him for such a trifle, especially for their reputation. Han Zhen recalled that even in a small place like Tai'nan Valley, there was a branch of the Myriad Treasures Pavilion.

So Han Zhen changed into a gray robe, put on a straw hat he had purchased from a rogue cultivator's stall—one capable of blocking spiritual perception—and, carrying the brocade box containing the talismans, stepped out of the pavilion. There were no suspicious individuals around. Presumably, Daoist Qingwen didn't have the time to constantly monitor him; perhaps the Black Fiend Sect had intense internal competition and strict performance evaluations? Han Zhen didn't see Han Yunzhi's stall at the usual spot in the square, so he proceeded to the Tai'nan Valley branch of the Myriad Treasures Pavilion. The bright hall, spacious enough to accommodate dozens of people without feeling crowded, was clearly prepared for the influx of cultivators during the Tai'nan Minor Convention. Currently, there weren't many customers, only three or four low-level Qi Condensation attendants in green robes. Inside the counters were various miscellaneous items: pills, talismans, materials, and spirit-infused artifacts, none of which appeared to be ordinary.

As soon as he saw Han Zhen enter, a young attendant in a green shirt quickly came forward, saying with a cheerful smile, "Honored guest, what would you like to see? Would you like me to introduce some of our items? Everything in our shop is absolutely top-grade."

"I wish to sell a batch of talismans. If the price is fair, we can establish a long-term cooperation," Han Zhen said quietly to the attendant, avoiding the ears of others.

The attendant was slightly taken aback upon hearing this, then promptly led Han Zhen to a room on the second floor, showing no signs of looking down on rogue cultivators. The arrangement upstairs was completely different from downstairs. It was divided into individual rooms, elegantly and comfortably furnished. The green-robed attendant then asked Han Zhen to wait for a moment and withdrew.

Moments later, a middle-aged man with a goatee entered, a glint of spiritual light flashing in his eyes. "This one is Tian Yuanli, the manager of Myriad Treasures Pavilion. May I ask for your esteemed name?"

"This one is the rogue cultivator Mo Juren," Han Zhen replied. As he spoke, he took two brocade boxes from his bosom and placed them on the table, opening them directly.

Seeing the thick stacks of Quieting Talismans and Vajra Talismans brimming with abundant spiritual power, Manager Tian turned to the attendant and instructed, "Go, brew a pot of good tea!"
