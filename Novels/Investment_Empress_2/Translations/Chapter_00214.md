# Chapter 214: A Familiar Feeling, The Richest Man Arrives to Propose?!

Little Li swore that his character and moral integrity were impeccable.

But who could blame him? That swimsuit looked absolutely perfect on the Ice Cube. Her cold elegance and pure allure didn't conflict at all; instead, they complemented each other perfectly...

Who wouldn't be mesmerized by that?

The swimsuit was a reward from the System.

So!

The System is the one at fault; Little Li is innocent.

Li Mo wiped his nose and said seriously, "I was just refining pills with Senior Brother Xiao Bao at Old Xue's place. The fire energy was too intense, so... I got a bit overheated."

"You know how to refine pills?"

"A little."

Looking at the girl's jade-like face, a hint of unusual color flashed in her moonlit eyes.

The suppressed thoughts in Li Mo's mind made his nose itch again.

He distracted himself by saying, "Let's practice quickly. If we don't start soon, dawn will be here."

"Okay."

Glancing at the bright moon hanging in the western sky, Ying Bing nodded lightly.

"Wait!" Li Mo suddenly spoke again.

"What is it?"

"It's nothing, I just need to adjust my state."

The second layer of *Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh* allows one to vaguely sense the other's emotions.

Last time, when he was thinking about the techniques in the Flower-Picking Finger, his thoughts were a bit too wild, and his emotions changed, which the Ice Cube noticed.

Now, he has even more thoughts.

He swallowed a Clear Heart Pill, calmed his mind, and began to observe the Mona Ice Slush inside the World Seed.

A moment later.

Li Mo opened his eyes: "I'm ready."

Two massage chairs that could freely adjust their angles appeared out of thin air.

"Do you want one?"

Li Mo sat down, adjusted to a comfortable position, and turned back to ask.

Ying Bing's eyelashes trembled imperceptibly as she shook her head: "No."

"But it was fine last time..."

Li Mo was confused.

Ying Bing: "..."

Well... before their souls were connected and she hadn't sensed Little Li's ambiguous thoughts yet, it was indeed fine.

Since that time, she found it hard to look directly at this massage chair.

"Then let's start..."

"Wait."

Just as he was about to touch that jade-like hand, it suddenly retracted.

Li Mo was stunned.

He saw the girl close her eyes: "I need to adjust my breathing for a moment too."

The night wind blew gently, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse.

The shores of the Fish Dragon Lake were quiet, so quiet that you could only hear the faint rustling of clothes in the wind, mixed with the faint clinking of wind chimes from downstairs.

The young man and woman looked at each other without speaking, tacitly keeping silent.

A moment later.

A faint fluctuation of spiritual sense began to flow.

Time passed.

The moon set and the sun rose, dawn breaking in the east.

After a whole night, the two finally got up.

They hadn't even let go of the Ice Cube's hand when they heard a familiar voice:

"Junior Brother Li, there are so many people looking for you outside!"

Tang Xiao Bao rushed up, his small arms swinging back as he came to a sudden stop.

"How many?" Li Mo asked.

Tang Xiao Bao counted on his fingers, but found there weren't enough fingers, so he could only say, "Anyway, it's a lot, a whole lot. The threshold of the restaurant is almost worn out."

"Senior Brother Xiao Bao, do you know what they want with me?"

He had just learned last night that the Drizzle Building had increased the bounty on his head.

Li Mo had been on high alert ever since.

"Probably... probably because of the Hidden Dragon List? Junior Brother, you're famous now?"

Tang Xiao Bao clearly didn't know either.

Fame from the Hidden Dragon List...

That made sense. Although he didn't feel it personally, his and the Ice Cube's rankings were indeed shocking.

But the Ice Cube's ranking was clearly one spot higher than his.

Why were all the people coming to visit him?

"Senior Brother Xiao Bao, go and call all the elders."

"Okay."

"Wait, call the Master too."

Li Mo took out a sobering pill.

Then he turned back to call out to Ying Bing: "Ice Cube, are you coming with?"

"..."

Ying Bing shook her head lightly.

She didn't want to waste time dealing with these meaningless worldly affairs.

"Alright then, we'll go to Sword City together later."

Li Mo went downstairs.

Ying Bing silently watched the young man's departing back. She got up and brewed a pot of tea, planning to start practicing the *Xia Huang Qi* after drinking it.

*Xia Huang Qi* could convert different types of internal energy into different types of true essence.

After opening the second acupoint, she hadn't had a chance to do this yet.

She would do it in a moment...

Hmm?

As she sat back down, Ying Bing suddenly froze.

She saw her own chair, empty.

And the one she was sitting on now... was warm.

This touch reminded her of not long ago, when they were practicing swordsmanship and she wasn't paying attention...

Going with the flow was one thing.

But that scene... no matter how she thought about it, it wasn't natural.

...

As Senior Brother Xiao Bao had said, the scale of the visitors was indeed large.

It was reasonable to want to get acquainted with a prodigy from the Hidden Dragon List and a future powerhouse, but according to etiquette, they should have sent a calling card first and arranged a meeting place.

It seemed the visitors were in a great hurry, almost arriving the moment they learned of Li Mo's location.

As if afraid someone else would get there first.

The elders were quite pleased; the Clear Abyss Sect had never made a name for itself in Yunzhou before.

But after Li Mo told them about Xu Yi's matter, they calmed down.

After a discussion among everyone.

They still had to meet them, but Li Mo would keep his Heaven's Fate Divine Eye active the whole time.

Soon, everyone arrived at the first floor of the restaurant.

There were indeed many people, but they were all standing servants, mostly at the Internal Breath realm, with no lack of those at the Divine Observation realm.

Only one person was sitting.

Ouyang was a bit surprised when he saw this person.

"Merchant Sun?"

Merchant?

Li Mo looked over and saw the man Ouyang called Merchant Sun. He was a round, portly man wearing expensive silk clothes, with a thick gold belt adorned with gemstones and coral around his waist.

Two words: extravagant.

Completely different from the low-key Little Li.

"Greetings, esteemed experts of the Purple Sun Mansion."

Merchant Sun stood up, his words flattering the elders of the Clear Abyss Sect, but his gaze was fixed on Li Mo:

"I am Sun Gui, Chief Manager of the Hengtong Mercantile Guild in Yunzhou. I have come specifically to pay my respects to Young Hero Li today, and also to establish a connection with the experts of the Clear Abyss Sect."

The Hengtong Mercantile Guild was one of the four major guilds in the Great Yu Empire, with trade routes spanning north and south, and branches established in every state and prefecture.

Merchants in the Great Yu Empire didn't have high status on the surface, but that was just on the surface.

In reality, the Governor of Yunzhou and the Lord of Hengyun Sword City would treat Sun Gui with respect.

"So it's Manager Sun."

The Clear Abyss Sect members were polite and remained calm.

"May I ask what business Manager Sun has with me?"

Li Mo smiled, clasping his hands casually.

The other party wasn't an assassin from the Drizzle Building, but an Inner Scenery realm expert himself.

Sun Gui was a bit surprised.

Don't they know how rich I am?

But after a moment of abnormal expression, he regained a confident look.

"Young Hero Li is indeed a fine young man, good... very good."

Sun Gui got straight to the point:

"My daughter has always loved reading the storybooks written based on Young Hero Li. She has admired you for a long time and has been crying and making a fuss to me these past few days.

"I only have this one daughter, and my heart softened, so I prepared some humble gifts to come here."

"Men!"

He clapped his hands, and the servants outside opened the boxes one by one.

Except for the last large box.

In an instant, the dazzling light of pearls and jewels filled the eyes, and the treasures were dazzling, causing the onlookers to gasp in amazement.

"My purpose in coming here today is to propose a marriage. May I ask if Young Hero Li is already betrothed?"

*Tap—*

A light sound.

Someone had just stepped into the hall and happened to hear this sentence.

Ying Bing's calm and beautiful phoenix eyes narrowed slightly with a subtle expression.
