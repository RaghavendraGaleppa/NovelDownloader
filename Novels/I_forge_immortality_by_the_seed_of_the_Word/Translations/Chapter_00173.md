# Chapter 170: The Earth-Sundering King of Brightness

In the uppermost layer of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm.

Seven figures sitting in meditation simultaneously opened their eyes, their gazes projecting beams of divine immortal light that faintly outlined various principles of the Great Dao.

"The Proud Sun Seal? How interesting," spoke a crimson-robed figure among the seven.

"The Proud Sun... It's said that when the Void Spirit World was captured by the Seven Desires Divine Lord, its Great Dao core absorbed the will of countless living beings to condense into an undying proud sun, hidden within the sea of Dao principles in the transformed Proud Cloud Secret Realm. It seems the rumors are true," remarked another figure shrouded in magnificent magnetic immortal light, a hint of envy in their voice.

As they conversed, space rippled and coalesced into a massive black-robed figure standing over a thousand zhang tall, seated among the seven. The face hidden beneath the black robe was none other than the gigantic visage that had previously covered the sky, as witnessed by Zhang Jing and others.

"I inform you all that after this occasion, the Proud Cloud Secret Realm will alter its opening rules. Henceforth, the realm will open once every three thousand years. Entry will require Golden Core cultivation, and each individual may only enter once," the black-robed giant stated impassively.

The space fell into profound silence.

After a long pause, someone inquired curiously, "Is this due to the new opportunity rules that have appeared in the secret realm?"

After a moment's thought, the black-robed giant nodded. "Indeed. The secret realm requires a thousand years to condense a divine ability containing fragments of the undying proud sun's principles to serve as a reward."

"And what is the final reward for this occasion?" asked the crimson-robed figure who had spoken first.

"The Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud—a derivative of the Dao-bearing auspicious cloud that carries the undying proud sun and gathers the spiritual light of all beings. It is a first-rate empowerment divine ability," the black-robed giant answered without reservation. At this stage, even if he didn't explain, these individuals could guess most of it.

"Will both the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core champions receive this reward?"

"Yes."

"We understand. Thank you for informing us."

The black-robed giant's massive form gradually dissipated.

Not long after, a sigh filled with envy echoed through the space. "Ah... If only we hadn't been born so early..."

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

At dawn, Zhang Jing, who had been meditating, suddenly opened his eyes. Instantly, various Dao intents began to circulate around him, his aura surging from weak to strong like the revival of all things.

"It seems the time has come," Zhang Jing murmured as he stood and walked outside.

However, the moment he stepped out, Qu Junhou's figure appeared before him.

"Brother Qu, what are you—?" Zhang Jing asked, surprised.

Qu Junhou laughed. "Brother Zhang, isn't today the day we attend that Dao Tea Gathering at the Ten Thousand Immortals Pavilion? Wouldn't it be delightful if we went together?"

"You've been waiting for quite some time, haven't you? Since you know the place, you could have gone ahead first."

Qu Junhou chuckled awkwardly. "It's better to go together..."

The Ten Thousand Immortals Pavilion was a renowned gathering place in the thousand-mile Proud Cloud Immortal City, famed for its extravagance—its beams forged from immortal gold, its pools brimming with immortal wine, its floors paved with immortal crystals, and its decorations made of immortal treasures. It was a hub of activity, frequented by prominent figures without pause.

Yet today, an unusual solemnity pervaded the pavilion. Silence reigned where there was usually lively chatter, and the so-called "prominent figures" were conspicuously absent.

In the surrounding immortal inns and pavilions, many cultivators watched the Ten Thousand Immortals Pavilion with excitement, their divine senses fluctuating incessantly.

"Thanks to the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, we're getting quite the spectacle. Disciples from major factions that are rarely seen have been appearing one after another."

"Indeed! Just yesterday, I saw disciples from the Primordial Ancestor Immortal Sect, an immortal orthodox tradition from the Dongzhen Huamiao Heaven. Their auras were terrifying!"

"Wait, wasn't it the Primordial Demon—"

"Shh! Do you think you're a disciple of the Celestial Immortal orthodox traditions or other immortal orthodox factions? How dare you address them like that!"

"Thank you for the reminder."

"By the way, which faction's disciples are gathering at the Ten Thousand Immortals Pavilion today?"

"Rumor has it they're from the Taiyi Limitless Dao Sect."

"Another immortal orthodox tradition that rules over a celestial realm!"

Just then, an excited voice cried out, "Look! It's the Earth-Sundering King of Brightness! He's actually a disciple of the Taiyi Limitless Dao Sect—no wonder his strength is so terrifying!"

All eyes turned to Qu Junhou, clad in golden robes, who had suddenly appeared before the Ten Thousand Immortals Pavilion. His "exaggerated" performance in the secret realm had left a deep impression on the spectators.

"Wait, who's that man standing beside the Earth-Sundering King? He must be no ordinary figure if he can walk alongside him."

A woman in the corner spoke softly, "That man was in the twenty-ninth competition arena before. His signature move was a five-colored great hand seal, and his strength was formidable. He just didn't like to fight much."

The crowd nodded in understanding, then promptly ignored Zhang Jing and refocused on Qu Junhou.

"The Earth-Sundering King must be the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Taiyi Limitless Dao Sect this time," someone remarked.

But another immediately countered, "No, the strongest is said to be someone named Ge Qingshen. The Earth-Sundering King likely didn't exert himself much in the first round because his opponents were too weak."

"Truly unfathomable..."

Inside the Ten Thousand Immortals Pavilion, in a grand hall bathed in immortal light, nearly a hundred bronze tables were neatly arranged on either side, laden with immortal fruits and spiritual delicacies. Seated on cushions behind the tables were numerous disciples.

As time passed, more and more arrived. Disciples from the Lower Realm's Nine Domains and those from the Celestial Realm naturally divided themselves, sitting on opposite sides of the hall, separated by a carpet resembling a long river.

At the foremost table on the Nine Domains' side, Shen Chu sat with half-closed eyes, appearing utterly at ease—a stark contrast to the nervous expressions of his fellow disciples.

Noticing this, a man beside him asked in confusion, "Senior Brother Shen, the other side has even brought the legendary Senior Brother Ge Qingshen. Yet you don't seem the least bit worried. And why did you set up two additional seats at the front? Are there other cave-heaven senior brothers from the Nine Domains joining us? There was no news of this before!"

His gaze drifted to the front of the hall, where six bronze tables were placed on the raised platform—two on the Celestial Realm side and four on their own. The implication was clear.

Shen Chu smiled mysteriously. "I'll keep it a mystery for now. You'll find out soon enough."

In his mind, he recalled the figures of Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou, as well as their confident declaration: "Ge Qingshen? A mere clown."

"With these two senior brothers presiding, we'll finally make the Celestial Realm faction lower their haughty heads for once!" Shen Chu thought excitedly.

---

As time passed, the hall gradually filled. It became evident that the Celestial Realm faction far surpassed the Lower Realm's Nine Domains in both numbers and strength. Most Celestial Realm disciples regarded their counterparts with faint arrogance, though a few occasionally glanced at the two extra seats at the front, deep in thought.

The hall, now packed with over a hundred disciples, was eerily silent.

Then, footsteps echoed.

The sound shattered the stillness, and nearly a hundred powerful gazes turned toward the entrance.

Two figures walked in, one after the other.

Leading them was Zhang Jing.
