# Chapter 61: A Stitched-Together False Life

Qin Ming rubbed his temples. Every time he tried to recall those fragmented memories, he would feel a slight headache and mental fatigue. One could imagine how severely he was injured in the past; he had been reborn again and again, constantly improving his physique, yet he hadn't fully recovered. However, he was certain it would be soon. With continuous postnatal womb transformation, he would eventually resolve the last remaining minor issues in his body.

"Such disjointed scenes. My life feels stitched together, almost fake," Qin Ming frowned.

In his innocent childhood, he lived a impoverished life, his clothes ragged and full of patches. But by the time he was thirteen or fourteen, things were completely different. In those fragmented scenes, he had once galloped wildly on a beast outside a colossal city. His mount was tall and mighty, its scales shimmering with a hazy glow, clearly no ordinary creature.

Furthermore, he had resided in a vast mansion where all objects were exquisite and luxurious. Important figures there wore splendid robes and fine jade, their daily lives and travels meticulously arranged. Even the women's hair ornaments were extraordinary, either rare feathers shimmering with golden light used as hairpins, or a cluster of crimson-glowing, delicate and alluring peach blossoms nestled in their hair. In this magnificent mansion, he was named Cui Chonghe, likely a direct descendant. He had personally witnessed a boy, Cui Chongxuan, about a year younger than him, consume a three-colored flower and successfully merge four types of Skyglow Energy, causing widespread awe.

"It's baffling," Qin Ming muttered to himself.

He was a direct descendant there, and he could feel that his situation wasn't bad at all; he enjoyed fine clothes and delicious food, and even had rare exotic beasts for transport. But why hadn't he embarked on the path of cultivation? After Cui Chongxuan merged four single types of Skyglow Energy, gasps of admiration erupted. He was highly praised by the elders of the Cui family, who considered him remarkable, and for this, they even helped him find the priceless "Six Imperial Heart Sutra."

"Merging four types of Skyglow Energy doesn't seem like much," Qin Ming mused. In this remote place, he had easily surpassed that relying solely on himself. There were some things he couldn't comprehend; the fragmented scenes he had seen were still too few.

"The year I turned fourteen must have been a turning point," Qin Ming thought, recalling other incomplete scenes. At that time, he had returned to a life of poverty, his clothes no longer splendid but common, even tattered. He had become a boy in a village. Until one deep night, a feathered-robed youth appeared with others. A raging fire engulfed the entire village; almost everyone there died, and he was also severely wounded.

Qin Ming used tea to write several numbers on the table: three, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen. These corresponded to different age periods where his life was completely different, like a stitched-together, false existence. At the same time, searching through his fragmented past, he learned the name of the feathered-robed woman he had seen last night—Li Qingyue. When he was thirteen or fourteen, he often traveled with peers, all riding rare exotic beasts. In most of those scenes, Li Qingyue was present, being one of his good friends.

"Meeting in this remote place, yet she didn't recognize me. Is it because I'm down and out now, and have left the Cui family? Or is it because of the changes that happened two years ago, a deeper reason that I still can't access?" Qin Ming tried to sort out the timeline, but the more he struggled to recall, the more he dug, the more he felt that some life fragments were hollow, like rootless duckweed, as if they didn't belong to him. He shook his head, no longer dwelling on it. What good would knowing more do? He had long since left that colossal city, stranded in this place. There was nothing he could change right now. What mattered most now was accumulating strength, and as his life level ascended, those memories would naturally resurface.

Qin Ming refocused, turning his attention back to the yellowed book before him.

"Although the name 'Yellow Earth Palm' doesn't sound very appealing, according to the ancient records, it is a very orthodox profound art..." Qin Ming was surprised. The notes that followed indicated that everyone who had practiced this palm technique highly praised it, believing it to be incredibly powerful. However, due to limited talent, many couldn't reach its advanced stages. Some of the comments, judging by their tone, seemed to come from highly esteemed, aged masters, actually stating that the Yellow Earth Palm was in no way inferior to the ultimate techniques found in high-level Qi Cultivation arts. This completely piqued Qin Ming's interest. He began to calm his mind, preparing to meticulously study the book.

Gradually, a dense fog appeared before his eyes, followed by the emergence of an old man, demonstrating various combat techniques on the ground: from the metamorphosis of life levels, to the cultivation of Skyglow Energy, and then to the Yellow Earth Palm's ability to turn decay into wonder... Upon seeing the end, Qin Ming gasped in admiration, his thoughts soaring as he withdrew from that wondrous state. This ancient scroll had completely engrossed him, and he couldn't help but clap his hands in praise.

"If one could reach that level, their skill would be akin to the Dao!"

The name "Yellow Earth Palm" was chosen because its creator was overly modest. This palm technique, when initially mastered to a small degree, could penetrate bones, pierce organs, and shatter the body's interior through flesh.

"This is the marvelous application of soft energy," Qin Ming confirmed. This Skyglow Energy was definitely not a single energy technique; it must have integrated multiple secret energies, otherwise, it wouldn't be this powerful. "With further achievement, the soft Skyglow Energy would emanate from the fingertips, easily breaking armor, tearing through fur, scales, and horns, sweeping away everything."

Next, Qin Ming directly flipped to the last page, and those scenes appeared one by one.

"The highest realm of the Yellow Earth Palm actually cultivated a special power: Skyglow Energy condensed into wisps of Earth Qi, dramatically increasing its might." In the scene Qin Ming witnessed, the old man stood on the ground, his feet able to draw Earth Qi, merging it with Skyglow Energy. Finally, the Earth Essence Qi between his hands grew increasingly dense, gradually solidifying, as if a patch of yellow mud was attached to them. He swung his right hand, and a colossal beast, terrifying and mountain-like in size, was struck by his seemingly light palm. It shattered with crackling sounds, like a mountain of flesh being sliced and torn apart, staining the ground red.

"Incredible!" This had already gone beyond the scope of conventional combat techniques; it was highly unusual. The so-called "skill akin to the Dao" was precisely triggered by such profound methods that broke through conventional limitations.

"It's difficult to cultivate to the highest realm," Qin Ming sighed. He was confident in his comprehension, and coupled with emotional resonance, he could obtain the old man's experiences and insights, so that aspect was not an issue at all. Ultimately, it still came down to the accumulation of Skyglow Energy. Only when it was sufficiently profound could the soft Skyglow Energy draw forth the Earth Essence Qi.

Qin Ming stood in the courtyard, practicing, starting with the mysterious soft energy, as it was the essence of the book, supporting everything. Except for meal breaks, he continuously pondered and practiced diligently, from the soft Skyglow Energy to the Yellow Earth Palm. Qin Ming was eager to master it soon, as the Yellow Earth Palm had proven battle records, having slain those from beyond the mundane world.

After more than half a day, feeling a little tired, he finally stopped. As Qin Ming rested, he silently pondered. Among all the secret arts he had acquired, only the last stance of that saber manual could compare to the Yellow Earth Palm. That saber intent sought to cleave the heavens and tear through the night. Similarly, unleashing the full power of that ultimate saber intent also demanded extremely high requirements.

"I'm leaving soon, so I must fulfill what I promised others," Qin Ming valued his word. Since he had said it, he had to do it.

Not long after, he headed into the mountains with a casting net. The coldest days of winter had actually passed. In a little over a month, the ice and snow would begin to melt, and the time for the Fire Spring's revival and blooming flowers wouldn't be far off. Some birds were already becoming active, and it wouldn't be long before they started building nests. Qin Ming was already very familiar with the mountains and understood the habits of certain creatures. With his current skills, sneaking and ambushing small creatures wasn't difficult at all.

Half an hour later, he spotted his target and swiftly cast his net towards a cluster of thorns.

"Help, they're killing birds!" A small creature cried out from within the large net, frantically struggling, wanting to escape but unable to. Qin Ming was overjoyed and rushed forward. Inside was a small, pale blue bird. It was slightly shorter than a palm, with large, gem-like eyes that glowed, and it spoke human words: "Two-legged beast lord, spare me, please let me go! I'll lead you to catch a bear, it has plenty of meat!"

Before leaving, Qin Ming finally caught a talking sparrow, fulfilling his promise to little Wen Rui. At present, he couldn't possibly release this pale blue bird.

As he approached the village entrance, Qin Ming suddenly heard an exasperated voice from behind: "Who captured my wife? Stop right there, do you have a death wish?!" Qin Ming turned his head and recognized it at a glance. It was significantly larger than other talking sparrows, more intelligent, cunning, and extremely mouthy. It had once thoroughly infuriated Cao Long.

"Two-legged beast, release that talking sparrow, or I'll go invite Old Bear down the mountain to break into the village and tear you to shreds! Don't you know who I am? I am a famous sparrow of this mountain, I can even summon the Mountain Lord to wipe out your entire village!" The mouthy mutated talking sparrow's eyes were red, and it chased him closely, continuously intimidating and threatening him.

However, when it clearly saw that it was Qin Ming, it was instantly stunned and quickly changed its tune, saying: "Brother, this is a misunderstanding, like a dragon king's temple being flooded by his own waters... We're family, you know."

Qin Ming was surprised, looking at the talking sparrow in the night sky, which had gone from arrogant to obsequious, and was still quite a chatterbox.

"Master Wu instructed me before he left to help you deliver messages and scout paths in the mountains, but I've been a bit busy recently, just got married, so I haven't paid attention to these things."

"What nonsense!" Qin Ming didn't understand.

"Master Wu is that raven, following a woman completely covered in a black cloak. Let me tell you, that woman is called Tang Jin, her figure is exceptionally good, and her beauty is absolutely stunning. I can even draw her for you..."

Qin Ming suspected this was a human who had entered the mountains and transformed into an exotic creature.

"Brother, please be merciful, let my wife go."

***

Not long after, at Lu Ze's home, two children happily bounced around.

"Uncle, you're amazing! You actually caught a talking sparrow. I'm so happy, the little squirrel needs a companion."

"That's my wife! Squirrels should be paired with weasels!" the mutated talking sparrow shouted from the eaves, correcting them.

The mutated red squirrel immediately glared at it with an unfriendly gaze.

Lu Ze and his wife felt that these small animals had all become spirits!

Qin Ming said, "Just keep it for a few months then release it. I've talked it over with it. In the future, when Brother Lu goes into the mountains, it will help give warnings. Don't worry, it doesn't have any ill intentions, or I'll go find Master Wu."

The next day, Yang Yongqing sighed and brought his black mountain goat to find Qin Ming, preparing to set off together for Golden Rooster Ridge.

Qin Ming was speechless. He really didn't want to make another trip; it was a hundred li round trip. Why hadn't the incident erupted yet?

"Uncle, no rush. Just get there before dark. Why be so eager to join a bandit den?"

"Alright then."

Even after lunch, Qin Ming was unwilling to depart. Eventually, Yang Yongqing couldn't wait any longer. He worried that arriving late would invite trouble from the mountain bandits. Unable to persuade Qin Ming, he had no choice but to set off first. However, in less than half an hour, he returned, galloping back with a joyous swagger, his goat's hooves clattering. As soon as he reached the village entrance, he shouted with a laugh, "Great news! Heaven has opened its eyes and taken all the mountain bandits of Golden Rooster Ridge up to the sky, haha..."

"What?!" Everyone was startled and rushed out.

Yang Yongqing had been completely dumbfounded when he first heard the news on the way. Just yesterday, he had been cursing, saying that unless all the mountain bandits there died, he would have no choice but to report. Yet today, before he even reached Golden Rooster Ridge, it had truly become a Ridge of Silence!

Qin Ming drank a cup of coarse tea, looking out the window. The matter here had concluded, and it was time for him to embark on his journey.

***

In a renowned and brilliant city, magnificent buildings stood in clusters. In a grand hall adorned with sculpted beams and painted pillars, a dignified middle-aged man sat, saying, "Recently, several Yin-Yang Great Medicines have flowed out from Black-White Mountain, drawing the covetous eyes of many great families and those from beyond the mundane world. Cui Hong, you are quite familiar with that place, having gone to observe it two years ago. Go and see if you can retrieve a Yin-Yang Great Medicine."

A man with very long arms stood in the hall. Upon hearing this, he nodded in assent.

"Back then, you placed that child near Black-White Mountain, didn't you?"

"Yes. If he survived, he should have settled down there," the long-armed man replied.

"Take a look while you're there," the dignified middle-aged man instructed.

"Do you have any specific instructions?" the long-armed man cautiously asked. He knew that the dignified man sitting there wouldn't just ask him to "take a look" in passing.
