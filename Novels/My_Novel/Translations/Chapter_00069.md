# Chapter 69: The Carp Transforms into a Dragon, Li Xian Arrives

“Really!?”

Li Xian was overjoyed.

In the Great Wu Dynasty, both literary and martial pursuits were valued. Warriors could undergo a complete transformation, seizing the essence of heaven and earth to achieve formidable combat prowess.

Literati, on the other hand, used the tip of their brush to seize literary energy and claim good fortune for themselves. Though they lacked immense physical power, their influence and authority were not to be underestimated.

The phrase “plucking the flower” referred to achieving excellent results in the academic examination, allowing one to climb even higher.

“Ah, you two brothers are truly remarkable,” Auntie Liu said with a sigh of admiration. “One is even more impressive than the other.”

“Why didn’t my little brother come to tell me this good news himself?” Li Xian asked casually, his mood lifted.

Auntie Liu and Wang Yonghou were both taken aback. They exchanged a glance, their lips parting and closing as if they wanted to speak but hesitated.

“This matter…”

“I really don’t know if I should say it.”

Auntie Liu paced back and forth, her hesitation visible to the naked eye. Wang Yonghou spoke up, “I’ll tell him.”

“Xiao Xian, the two of us only heard this through the grapevine. Whether it’s true or false, you’ll have to decide for yourself.”

Li Xian frowned slightly and nodded. “Alright.”

“You went to work as a guard, so naturally, the old woman and I looked after Xiao Fan for you.”

“After treating the old woman’s illness with the money from last time, there were still a few hundred coins left. After thinking it over, the old woman and I picked a good day and went to Huangyu County to inquire.”

“We wanted to see how Xiao Fan was doing. If possible, we thought we could buy him some steamed buns or dry pancakes. A ten-year-old child, with no one to care for or check on him, is truly pitiful.”

“But when we got there, we heard some bad rumors.”

Wang Yonghou carefully observed Li Xian’s expression. Seeing that he remained calm, he continued, “We heard…”

“Xiao Fan has been detained by someone.”

“What happened?” A cold light flashed in Li Xian’s eyes as he immediately pressed for details.

Auntie Liu said, “I heard… It seems a young master from some gang also took the exam. Unfortunately, his knowledge was too shallow, and he failed to ‘pluck the flower.’ He ranked thirty-seventh, just outside the quota.”

“If just one person doesn’t go, he can… take the spot by succession.”

“The students who ranked ahead are, at the very least, from wealthy families. Our Xiao Fan is the only one who wears patched-up clothes and is just a child, barely ten years old.”

“They naturally pick on the softest persimmon.”

“However… this is just a rumor, we don’t know if it’s true.”

The couple, Liu and Wang, looked anxious and chose their words carefully.

Li Xian was no fool. If the rumor were false, why would the couple seek him out? It was highly likely that the rumor was true, and his younger brother was in a precarious situation.

“Is my brother’s life in danger?” Li Xian asked.

“From the rumor, it seems not,” Auntie Liu said uncertainly. “Even the young master of that gang wouldn’t want to bring trouble upon himself. An act like ‘killing to steal the flower’ is too despicable and disgraceful.”

“Besides, such an action would be seriously investigated. A ‘plucked flower’ student is different from an ordinary person; they are qualified to… claim that mysterious fortune.”

“Ah, we don’t understand the specific details, but the point is, his life is safe.”

“But… but…”

“He won’t be having a good time, that’s for sure.”

Li Xian thought to himself that Liu and Wang were farmers who had never stepped half a foot out of Qingning County in their lives. For his sake, they had traveled all the way to Huangyu County, which was already a tremendous kindness.

Their horizons were limited, so their understanding of the situation was likely biased. Pressing them further would be unreasonable. It was better to investigate personally.

He pondered for a moment. “Do you know where they are hiding my brother?”

“I… I don’t know,” Auntie Liu shook her head.

“Alright, Auntie Liu, Uncle Wang, you two go back. And whatever you do, don’t say you’ve seen me. This matter has nothing to do with you,” Li Xian said solemnly.

“Xiao Xian, you… you… must stay calm,” Auntie Liu said with concern.

“Don’t worry, I’m very calm,” Li Xian said with a smile.

“Sir.”

Bi Hao, who had been watching from the side, bowed and scraped, ready to say something fawning. But he saw Li Xian stride past him without stopping.

“Truly a man of stature. The way he walks commands respect.”

Bi Hao watched Li Xian’s retreating back, his envy unmistakable.

Li Xian took a deep breath.

This was the critical moment for his brother to leap over the Dragon Gate and make a name for himself. As his older brother, he had to give his full support.

Fortunately, I have never neglected my martial arts in my daily life.

At a time like this, the only thing I can rely on is this body of mine.

Li Xian suppressed his anger deep inside, remaining calm and composed… like a heavy, cold bronze tripod.

He found Pang Long and asked for temporary leave.

Then he went to his quarters to retrieve the “Deer-Shooting Bow.”

“Master Li, where are you off to?”

A guard who saw Li Xian asked curiously.

“A private matter,” Li Xian replied. He suddenly stopped and sized up the guard, noticing their similar height. “I remember you have a decent set of clothes?”

“Hehe, that’s right,” the guard laughed.

“I’ll buy them from you for fifty coins,” Li Xian said.

“Come on, Master Li, if you want it, how could I not give it to you?” the guard said ingratiatingly.

Li Xian said, “Thanks, but I still have to pay.”

He spent some time buying a new set of clothing.

Leaving the estate, he found a dense forest and changed out of his guard uniform into the new clothes. It was a bright red cloth shirt, slightly conspicuous, but it wouldn’t immediately identify him as a guard.

He buried his old clothes under a tree. With the long bow on his back, Li Xian hurried to Qingning County.

In his memory, there was a blacksmith’s shop in the east of the city that secretly sold knives.

He arrived at the blacksmith’s. The blacksmith was a big, dark-skinned man, half his body covered in溃烂 burns, his appearance ferocious. He had no children and made a living by forging iron and selling knives.

“Kid, judging by your look, you’re no ordinary customer.”

The blacksmith swung his arm, hammering a red-hot piece of iron, sending sparks flying. He glanced at Li Xian and said casually.

“I want a knife,” Li Xian got straight to the point.

“Alright,” the blacksmith said. “Five hundred coins. Pay up and see the blade.”

Qingning County strictly controlled knives, so they were very expensive.

After receiving the money, the blacksmith weighed it lightly and said with a smile, “Here you go.”

He opened a wooden box and tossed the knife inside. Li Xian reached out and caught it. It was a narrow, single-edged knife about two fingers wide, made of very average material. It was ordinary crude iron, but the craftsmanship was commendable, and it felt good to swing.

With his internal energy flowing, swinging the long knife would be more than enough to cut through skin and flesh.

“It’s not as good as the lady’s weapon. It’s a pity that I can’t wear a blade on a regular basis, and I’m on leave.”

The rules of the estate were strict.

Li Xian wasn’t afraid to break them; he just couldn’t access the better weapons.

The crude iron narrow knife would have to suffice.

“Kid, keep a low profile and put this on,” the blacksmith tossed over a cloth bag. “Don’t bring any trouble to me.”

“Thanks.”

Li Xian put the bag over the knife, completely concealing its glint. He replied淡淡ly and quickly left.

“I need to buy some more bows and arrows. That way, I’ll have bows for long range and knives for close quarters. I also have the Breeze Legs, Square Fist, and Green Silk Palm…”

“As long as I’m careful, I should be able to handle anyone as long as I don’t run into a master of the坛中仙 level, someone at the Essence-Devouring Realm.”

A cold light flashed in Li Xian’s eyes.

He knew this journey would be fraught with danger, and it was unclear just how big a mess he might stir up. Helping his brother leap over the Dragon Gate was naturally the top priority, but he wouldn’t act recklessly. His own life was equally important and not to be treated lightly.

Strategy over brute force!

Evasion and maneuvering were key!

Hunters’ arrows were usually self-made. Li Xian was short on time and had no heart for crafting, so he went directly to nearby hunters to buy them.

He replenished his arrows to two hundred, then went to the county’s black market to buy some gunpowder and poison.

These items were incredibly expensive. The sellers knew Li Xian was in a hurry and quoted sky-high prices. Fortunately, Li Xian had some savings left, and after spending two taels of silver, he had everything he needed.

He then set off for Huangyu County.

The wind and snow raged ceaselessly between heaven and earth.

The carp is about to transform into a golden dragon, peering into the golden palaces of heaven. Li Xian arrives, treading through the snow, to taste the salt and spice of the Jianghu.
