# Chapter 33: Stationed Guard

"My name is Li Shiming. I came to Zhongdu to participate in the imperial examinations and prepare for next year's Ascension Assembly!" Li Shiming didn't dare make any suspicious moves and honestly reported his identity and purpose for coming to Zhongdu.

"Where did you obtain your cultivation? And why are you lingering near the imperial palace?" Gu Jia, hearing that he came for the Ascension Assembly and imperial examinations, pressed further with disbelief.

"I found a book in the back garden of Nanling Prefecture's government office and cultivated according to its methods. I came to the imperial palace just to see it for myself," Li Shiming replied, his answer ninety percent truth with a sliver of falsehood.

"Nonsense! Without a spiritual energy environment, you couldn't even begin cultivation, let alone reach the second level of Qi Refining!" Gu Jia's expression darkened as a wave of pressure descended upon Li Shiming.

Li Shiming felt his entire body grow heavy, forcing him to hunch over, nearly collapsing in the carriage.

"Two months ago, two immortals came to Nanling Prefecture to investigate a case and later left unexpectedly. They stayed at the government office during their visit. After they left, I found some spirit stones in their room. I used them to cultivate and form a spiritual energy vortex," Li Shiming quickly explained.

As the stationed cultivator in Daxia, Gu Jia was naturally aware of the incident where cultivators had been summoned to Nanling Prefecture for assistance. 

Comparing the details, he could tell that most of Li Shiming's account was true.

"How did you know to call them 'spirit stones'?" Gu Jia's eyes flashed as he caught a potential inconsistency in Li Shiming's story.

"I met Fan Yiyang from Tianhai Sect. He told me many things about the cultivation world," Li Shiming answered.

"You know Fan Yiyang too!" Gu Jia exclaimed in surprise before withdrawing his pressure with a smile. "I'll investigate your claims, but don't worry. If you're telling the truth, this will actually benefit your participation in the Ascension Assembly."

"Thank you for your leniency," Li Shiming said with relief, straightening up and cupping his hands in respect.

"Didn't Fan Yiyang tell you that cultivators shouldn't casually approach the imperial palace?" Gu Jia waved off his gesture and asked.

Li Shiming could only smile wryly and shake his head. He hadn't mentioned his plans to visit the palace to Fan Yiyang, so the latter naturally wouldn't have warned him. 

Now he understood why Gu Jia, a powerful cultivator, had intercepted him—he had practically delivered himself to the man's doorstep.

"Do you have a grudge against Prince Shun?" Gu Jia suddenly asked.

"This..." Li Shiming hesitated, unsure how to answer. He didn't dare lie to Gu Jia.

"What's there to hesitate about? He's just a secular prince," Gu Jia laughed heartily.

From his tone, Li Shiming detected clear disdain for the imperial family. 

What puzzled him was why Gu Jia would station himself here if he held such contempt for the secular royalty.

"Last night, assassins sent by Prince Shun's household tried to kill me," Li Shiming answered truthically, now understanding Gu Jia's attitude.

"Hahaha!" Gu Jia burst into laughter again, as if hearing something immensely amusing. 

To him, it was indeed laughable—a mere secular prince sending assassins after a cultivator, even one only at the second level of Qi Refining, was utterly ridiculous.

The true joke was on Prince Shun. Gu Jia imagined the prince wouldn't sleep soundly if he knew his target was a cultivator.

"You can't take action near the imperial palace. Also, if you have other means at your disposal, try not to use spiritual energy. That way, even if something happens, it won't fall under my jurisdiction," Gu Jia said nonchalantly after his laughter subsided.

Li Shiming was taken aback—he hadn't expected Gu Jia to help him.

"Thank you, senior," he said with a bow.

"Don't call me 'senior.' We're both at the Qi Refining stage. Call me 'Brother Dao.' Once you join Tianhai Sect, you'll call me 'Senior Brother,'" Gu Jia waved his hand dismissively.

Having lived long enough to become shrewd, Gu Jia recognized that most of Li Shiming's story rang true, and verification would be simple.

If Li Shiming's background proved clean, coupled with his talent for reaching the second level of Qi Refining in just over two months of solitary cultivation, joining Tianhai Sect wouldn't be an issue.

On this point, Gu Jia and Fan Yiyang shared the same view.

Cultivators assigned to secular postings were either like Fan Yiyang—those with abysmal talent—or like Gu Jia himself, semi-retired cultivators who had reached their limits.

Stationed guard duties in the secular world were low-risk yet offered rewards and imperial patronage. 

Such cultivators shared one trait: they sought to befriend promising talents, even investing in them.

Cultivators valued old favors—whether for appearances or to stabilize their Dao hearts. Those who achieved success in cultivation would inevitably repay past kindnesses.

"Thank you for your guidance, Brother Dao," Li Shiming amended his address.

"Young friend, return for now. We'll speak again in a few days," Gu Jia said, waving his hand toward Mo Yan.

Then, his figure inexplicably vanished, leaving the space before the carriage empty.

Li Shiming was inwardly shocked—he'd been watching intently yet couldn't discern how Gu Jia had departed. 

Had they clashed, he likely wouldn't have even known how he died.

Helplessly, he turned his consciousness to his machine room space, where five white phosphorus bombs and five thermite bombs lay in a crate. Yet earlier, he couldn't even move a finger.

Even if he could retrieve the bombs, throwing them would be impossible—suicide would be the only outcome. 

And even that wasn't guaranteed. Gu Jia's speed was so tremendous that Li Shiming couldn't track it, making the chances of successfully striking him negligible.

"Young master, someone blocked our way!" Mo Yan regained consciousness, still somewhat disoriented as he muttered.

"Eh? Where'd they go?" He soon noticed the empty road ahead and exclaimed.

"No need for alarm. Let's return," Li Shiming ordered sternly, offering no explanation.

As Mo Yan drove the carriage, he kept glancing back at the spot, his mind muddled—unsure whether the earlier events had truly occurred or were just his imagination.

Seated inside the carriage, Li Shiming pondered the matter of Gu Jia.

Unlike Fan Yiyang, whom he'd met by chance on the road and might not see again for who knew how long, Gu Jia was permanently stationed in Zhongdu—and most crucially, connected to the Ascension Assembly.

This connection alone made maintaining good relations with Gu Jia essential.

The only things Li Shiming could offer were spirit rice and spirit tea. 

He was reluctant to present the spirit rice because any investigation into his background would reveal his inability to cultivate it. 

The hundred catties sold to Fan Yiyang could be explained as a lucky find, but producing more would raise suspicions.

Though the spirit tea was imitation, it remained the best item his current identity could reasonably provide.
