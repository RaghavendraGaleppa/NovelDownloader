# Chapter 109: Various Departments

Fu Jin took over the hammer again, and his face immediately flushed red. The nearly four-hundred-pound hammer trembled violently in his palm, buzzing incessantly until he had to let go. The lightning patterns on the dark, lustrous surface of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer shimmered with a faint purple glow in the sunlight.

"If I were in the Blood Transformation Realm, I could easily wield it. Unfortunately... though treasure artifacts aren't as sentient as divine weapons, they still possess killing intent. This killing intent recognizes only Junior Brother. It seems it was forged using the base of your瓮金锤 (Weng Gold Hammer)."

Fu Jin shook his wrist with a wry smile, glancing at the coiled red scale patterns on the hammer handle that were exhaling waves of heat.

"This fierce object only recognizes Junior Brother's blood and energy. I'm afraid that when Master refined the Weng Gold Hammer, he asked for your essence blood as a catalyst."

Xu Yunfan said, "Senior Brother has a keen eye. The other day, Master specifically came to draw my blood. At the time, I found it puzzling, but now I see the reason. He is indeed meticulous."

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan swung the heavy hammer in his hand. The wind from the hammer swept past, causing the walls that had been scorched black over the years to crack piece by piece.

Fu Jin's pupils constricted as he stared at the marks on the ground. He had seen many who had perfected the first level, but among those who could wield hammer techniques to such a realm, considering the Divine Weapon Ridge and now the Casting Hall, there was only one in a hundred years.

"Senior Brother, why don't you try it? Treasure artifacts aren't divine weapons. With sufficient strength, you can easily wield it."

Watching Xu Yunfan's attempt to persuade him, Fu Jin waved his hand. "Enough. If Master found out, I wouldn't be able to get out of bed for three days. Just get used to it properly. A month from now, at the True Disciple Ceremony, our Casting Hall will be counting on you to shine. Practice well. Perfecting the Skin Refinement level—few disciples in the history of the Divine Weapon Ridge of the Heavenly Palace Cave have achieved this. But remain humble and composed. I'm off."

He glanced at the fine steel case on Xu Yunfan's back and muttered, "I wonder what's in that case of yours. You never put it down, whether you're eating, sleeping, or bathing."

Most elderly people are like this, with endless words to say. He left while still muttering.

After bidding farewell, Xu Yunfan shouldered the heavy hammer and excitedly returned to his residence.

Without any intention of resting, he hooked his hand around the蟒筋缠柄 (python tendon-wrapped handle) of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. The muscles of his forearm suddenly contracted like a steel cable winch.

The piercing sound of the nearly four-hundred-pound hammer cutting through the air startled the bronze bells at the eaves into a clatter.

He executed the Thirty-Six Paths of Cloak Hammer to the twenty-first form, "Cloud-Shattering Stance." The spiral energy enveloping the hammer head plowed a half-foot-deep trench in the ground. This was a technique that purely relied on the unity of waist and horse, converting the weapon's weight into destructive force, combined with the flow of blood and energy, to achieve the ultimate expression of a treasure artifact's spontaneous aura.

"Boom!"

The moment the hammer head struck the cast iron training post, the scapulae of Xu Yunfan cracked like popping beans.

The thirty-inch-thick solid steel pillar dented with a sound, and spiderweb cracks spread along the cast iron texture down to its base.

"Sinews and membranes have turned into woven black-gold threads embedded in bone, and the skin has become layered scales forged a hundred times... I wonder what it will be like after perfecting the Bone Refinement level."

Xu Yunfan grinned.

"Exhilarating!"

Perfecting the Bone Refinement level was still a long way off. Based on his current cultivation efficiency, he would need at least another half year to achieve perfection.

He still felt it was a bit slow.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

He had lost the mood to continue training.

Having perfected the Sinew Refinement level, and with today being a day off, he naturally needed to relax and enjoy himself.

Getting dressed and slinging the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer on his back, parallel to the fine steel case, Xu Yunfan leisurely stepped out.

Since entering the Heavenly Palace Cave, he had not left the Casting Hall's territory. Today was a good opportunity to go for a stroll.

Following the path he had taken before, Xu Yunfan stepped into the Outer City's Thousand Mechanisms Workshop.

The population of the Heavenly Craft City was nearly two hundred thousand, mostly the families and relatives of mountain gate disciples accumulated over the years. The pedestrians on the streets were mostly martial artists from the Jianghu, many of whom came to the Heavenly Palace Cave to find a suitable weapon.

The Outer City's Thousand Mechanisms Workshop was the most prosperous place in the Heavenly Craft City.

In the afterglow of the setting sun, an eight-zhang-tall bronze waterwheel was channeling water from the Luo River into the underground mechanism hub. The sound of gears meshing mixed with the forging sounds from blacksmith shops.

Xu Yunfan shoved the meat skewers from the stick into his mouth in one go and casually threw the stick on the ground.

"Hey, hey, hey! Littering! Fine of ten coins!"

A patrolling disciple of the Heavenly Craft Cave, with an armband, strode over aggressively.

Xu Yunfan: "..."

After silently paying the fee, Xu Yunfan lowered his head and quickly disappeared into the crowd. If someone recognized him, it would be the Casting Hall's reputation at stake.

"The people from the Hidden Blade Pavilion have arrived!"

The owner of a roadside pharmacy suddenly exclaimed.

Six black warhorses trotted in unison across the long street. The riders on their backs all carried seven-foot-long mechanism sword cases on their backs.

The leading youth had a cold and stern expression. At his waist hung a藏锋令 (Hidden Blade Order) inlaid with gold and silver. He was齐桓 (Qi Huan), twenty-five years old, who had mastered the迭浪剑 (Stacking Waves Sword) technique. He was at the Third Refinement's great success level, just a step away from the External Three Harmonies. It was said that he was also seeking perfection in one of the Sinew, Bone, or Skin levels, which was why he had delayed stabilizing his bones and skin.

Xu Yunfan noticed his right hand holding the reins. The knuckles were as thick as iron, and the blue veins on the back of his hand coiled like old tree roots. This was the state where the external hard skills had achieved resonance between sinews and bones.

With such an arm, holding a weapon was as steady as a rock, unmoving, which was quite rare.

紧跟着 (Tightly following) beside him was Yue Shan, who had crushed his courtyard gate the other day.

At a glance, the group saw Xu Yunfan standing at the side, a long-handled heavy hammer on his back and several skewers in his hand. Yue Shan, in particular, was first stunned, then his expression relaxed slightly, as if heaved a sigh of relief.

This left Xu Yunfan somewhat confused.

Yue Shan tugged on the reins, staring intently at Xu Yunfan, and said, "So you do know how to rest."

Xu Yunfan found this莫名其妙 (puzzling) and said with some displeasure, "What do you mean by that?"

After speaking, he looked at the鳞马 (scale horse) under Yue Shan and frowned. "Is it too abusive to have such a small horse carry such a big man?"

Yue Shan was two and a half meters tall. Although the scale horse was tall, riding it looked rather comical.

A flash of anger passed through Yue Shan's eyes.

Before he could speak, Qi Huan, who was in the middle, stared at Xu Yunfan and said, "Xu Yunfan?"

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows. "I know you."

A few days ago, on the north peak of the牯牛山 (Bull Mountain), the man he had looked at from afar was unexpectedly a disciple of the Hidden Blade Pavilion.

Qi Huan said calmly, "A month from now, I will attend the True Disciple Ceremony of the Casting Hall. Be careful then."

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows, watching the backs of these people as they left. He shook his head secretly and said nothing.

By then, he would make these people understand why the flowers are so red.

Turning the朱雀桥 (Vermilion Bird Bridge), on the烟雨楼 (Misty Rain Tower).

Two pairs of eyes were watching everything happening on the street.

"He doesn't seem like much... but that heavy hammer on his back is quite good."

Yan Yuwei of the Melting Gold Hall, propping her chin with her hand and leaning against the windowsill, looked down at Xu Yunfan, who was buying a bag of large meat buns and slowly leaving.

"I just got the news. The heavy hammer on his back is called the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. It was jointly forged by my Master and Master Zhan Yan of the Casting Hall. It contains Heavenly Craft forging techniques and has many mechanisms built into it... It's a treasure artifact."

Mo Thirteen was fiddling with the miniature iron parts on the table. As he spoke, he assembled a tiger-shaped mechanical beast.

*Clatter!*

Yan Yuwei suddenly stood up. Her nearly two-meter-tall frame was covered in bulging muscles, and her blue veins pulsed one after another, which was extremely startling.
