# Chapter 245: Acquired

When Xu Yunfan was idly contemplating the Triple Burner Sword Qi once more, a sudden, heavy gasp came from Pei Yan beside him.

Xu Yunfan turned his head to look and saw Pei Yan lying at the edge of the ground fire, panting heavily, his chest heaving violently.

Although the veins on his forehead and neck still throbbed intermittently, they were clearly much more vigorous than yesterday.

"How is it?" Xu Yunfan asked.

The dark purple halo of the surging ground fire cast flickering light and shadow over half of Pei Yan's face. He bent his finger to wipe away the dark green toxic blood from the corner of his mouth, his fingernails plowing five charred marks into the rock wall.

The venom patterns of the flood dragon that had originally climbed up to the Celestial Prominence Acupoint had receded to the膻中穴 (Shanzhong Acupoint). Beneath the festering skin, faint golden meridians could be seen slowly regenerating. Without the erosion of the flood dragon's venom, the Sword Pavilion's secret transmission of the Zhou Tian Sword Bone technique was spontaneously circulating its strength to heal his injuries.

"Four-tenths gone," Pei Yan answered after carefully sensing the inside of his body.

Xu Yunfan flicked away the volcanic ash stuck to his hammer handle with a snap of his finger. The thunder-patterned mouth of the hammer struck his fingernail, sending sparks flying, causing him to raise his eyebrow slightly.

Pei Yan's expression was excited, tinged with joy. "Brother Xu, if I were to take three more breaths of Ginseng Qi now, and refine it with the ground fire, perhaps I could wash the flood dragon venom from your body..."

"Do you think Ginseng Qi is some common market pancake?" Xu Yunfan suddenly scoffed.

When Pei Yan forcefully propped himself up, the joints of his spine actually emitted a clanging sound like a sword case opening and closing. His plain robe, soaked in toxic blood, stirred without wind, and his eyes shone brightly.

"Brother Xu, do you know that the breath of Ginseng Qi I just took is worth the value of a divine weapon from the Sword Pavilion?"

Xu Yunfan's wrist holding the hammer sank slightly, the head of the hammer pressing a spider-web-like scorch mark into the ground.

He squinted at Pei Yan, whose spirit was growing increasingly brighter. Pei Yan even flicked his finger, and a gust of sword wind shot out from his fingertip.

The stalactites hanging upside down on a nearby rock wall suddenly exploded into dust.

Xu Yunfan suddenly recalled that several days ago, when Pei Yan used the "Sword Qi Walking the Triple Burner" on the evil flood dragon, the sword wind sweeping across the rock wall had produced the same bone-shaving, powder-turning commotion.

"Brother Xu is quite the calculator," Xu Yunfan said with a hint of a smile on his face, his expression full of amiability. "I wonder what Brother Xu plans to do next."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's attitude of "no hare, no hawk," and not taking up his topic at all, Pei Yan sighed inwardly and completely suppressed the thoughts in his heart.

Pei Yan said directly, "Brother Xu, I still need your help!"

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrow, the tension in his eyes easing slightly, but he feigned difficulty on his face.

"Brother Xu, it's not that I don't want to help you. In this era of the decline of the Great Dao, this Ginseng Qi is truly too precious. A single mouthful of Ginseng Qi can wash the body and alter one's aptitude."

This Ginseng Qi was truly extraordinary.

He had been absorbing Ginseng Qi for a long time. Although most of it was used to practice martial arts, there were still wisps of spiritual marrow subtly changing his bone structure.

Not to mention that, even if Pei Yan wanted it, Xu Yunfan wouldn't give it out easily. The other party's strength was decent, and although it couldn't compare to his, he still had a divine armor on him, which was somewhat troublesome.

Furthermore, this matter was only manageable because Pei Yan was injured. Once the other party's injuries were fully recovered, if Xu Yunfan wanted to obtain the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art, the initiative would no longer be in his hands.

"The Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art is divided into three volumes, nine chapters, and twenty-eight essential formulas," Pei Yan suddenly said after a long silence. "I can teach you the general outline, but..."

"No problem, but I need the general outlines of all three volumes and the twenty-eight essential formulas. You don't need to say the rest."

Xu Yunfan's eyes shone brightly.

A dull rumble came from the depths of the ground veins, and at that moment, a stream of ground fire suddenly shot up three zhang high without stopping.

"Alright!" Pei Yan carefully considered it. The Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art was exquisite and supreme. Even if one knew the general outline, if one didn't understand the specific circulation and tempering methods within it, a tiny error could lead to a thousand miles of difference. If one wasn't careful, the Qi might explode inside the viscera, turning one's five organs and six bowels into a puddle of mud.

Even if Xu Yunfan obtained the general outline, without knowing the details, he would at most reach the entry level. To practice it to the Great Perfection realm would be no different from a fool's dream.

Moreover, it was still a question whether he could even enter the organ-refining stage.

The three great barriers—blood exchange, marrow washing, and organ refining—are each like a mountain. Many people are stuck at a single barrier for their entire lives, unable to advance an inch.

Among those geniuses who were once famous in the Jianghu, how many were able to reach the other shore?

"The three volumes of Void Clearing. The upper volume, 'Qi Rushing the Dipper,' governs the肃杀 (sù shā, severe and killing) nature of Lung Metal," Pei Yan's voice slowly rang out as he walked to the edge of the stone wall. His wrist bones shifted like a sword tip scraping snow, and a diagram of the visceral meridians' circulation instantly appeared on the stone surface.

"By now, you have already cultivated a strand of sword intent through the Triple Burner Sword Cultivation Formula, which can travel within the meridians. With the recovery of the world's Primordial Spirit Qi, you can guide the spiritual Qi into the Canopy,逆行 (nì xíng, retrograde) along the Hand Greater Yin Lung Meridian for three cycles, using the Shanzhong Acupoint as a whetstone to grind out a sword spine."

Xu Yunfan's pupils reflected the circuit diagram traced by Pei Yan, and his Status Panel suddenly burst forth with azure light.

The twenty-eight interwoven blood patterns in his vision automatically disassembled and reassembled, transforming into three hundred and sixty flickering acupoint light dots.

'You are comprehending "Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art · Upper Volume"'

Watching the information prompt appear in his vision, Xu Yunfan remained expressionless. The large tendon behind his ear trembled lightly like a zither string, suppressing the excitement in his heart.

At that moment, Pei Yan, who was explaining, deliberately skipped over the essential formula that the "Swivel Pivot Inversion" required vibrating the Huiyin Acupoint. That oversight was enough to cause an ordinary person, after entering the practice, to die from an anal explosion if their sword Qi went astray without special instructions.

"The middle volume, 'Melting Gold Quenching Fire,'" Pei Yan pointed with two fingers like a sword towards his own spleen location. As the sword Qi swelled within his body, the ground fire made the outline of his viscera appear with extreme clarity. "Use the Foot Greater Yin Stomach Meridian as a blast furnace. At the辰时 (chén shí, 7-9 a.m.) every day, you must swallow three qian of Red Gold Sand, borrowing the power of the geomagnetism to forge the purity of the sword Qi."

As time passed, the flood dragon venom began to slowly spread again. Pei Yan couldn't help but cough up half a mouthful of black blood, and his sword-spine-like backbone emitted a creaking, unbearable groan. "The lower volume, 'Purple Mansion Listening to Thunder,' is the most dangerous. When the sword Qi enters the brain, one must..."

Two hours later, after Xu Yunfan had finished asking about every single doubt in the general outline and essential formulas, a message suddenly floated out in his vision.

'You have learned the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art'

In the Skills column of the Status Panel, an entry for 'Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art (Not Yet Mastered)' appeared prominently. At the same time, a large amount of related cultivation essentials for the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art suddenly surfaced in his mind.

A complete set of the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art technique.

Just as expected!

Xu Yunfan was delighted inwardly. As long as he knew the general outline of the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art, the Status Panel would naturally be able to complete it.

Although he couldn't cultivate it for now, the tempering methods within the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art were still worth learning from. All he needed to do next was get his strength into his marrow, further condense his Qi, and after stepping into the marrow-washing realm, he would naturally be able to put the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art on his schedule.

Pei Yan suddenly stopped talking. Looking at Xu Yunfan, who seemed to be lost in thought, he slowly said, "The general outlines of the three volumes of the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art have been fully explained. The rest is nothing but specific joint cultivation methods. Brother Xu, what comes next will require your help."

Xu Yunfan agreed immediately.

"Brother Xu, please forgive me for what I am about to do."

(Allow me to rest today. I was too tired last month. Thank you all. I will work hard tomorrow! Thank you, esteemed audience, for your recognition. Thanks!)
