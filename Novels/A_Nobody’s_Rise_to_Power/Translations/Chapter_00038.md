# Chapter 38: Let’s Go Together

The man standing in the main hall turned sharply at the sound of Yang Can’s voice.

Yang Can’s unease instantly vanished.

*So it’s just Cheng Dakuan! What was he doing standing there striking a pose?*

Yang Can walked into the hall somewhat impatiently. "Dakuan, you’ve recovered?"

The Leopard Head punched his chest. "七八成 recovered (七八成 recovered)."

Yang Can looked him up and down. "Why are you dressed like this? You look like a wandering martial artist."

The Leopard Head’s expression darkened. "There is no place for me in the guard squad anymore. That Liu Yu..."

The Leopard Head ground his teeth, then looked at Yang Can with gratitude. "Fortunately, my eyes aren't completely blind. From now on, I, Leopard Head, will follow Master Yang. I will serve you faithfully."

Yang Can waved his hand. "Dakuan, I never treated you as an ordinary guard. You are just temporarily down on your luck. It’s nothing but a temporary setback. With your skills, you will rise again one day."

Cheng Dakuan felt a warmth in his heart. Since being punished, he had truly experienced the fickleness of human relationships.

Especially when he was on the brink of death from illness. Those who once flattered him turned around to step on him. Those who once called him brother avoided him as if he were the plague. Those who had received his guidance and kindness, fearing to offend Liu Yu, did not dare to visit.

These experiences had tempered the Leopard Head’s mind. His temperament had changed greatly compared to the past.

The Leopard Head said emotionally, "Master Yang, only after falling into misfortune did I realize who the true gentleman is."

"You flatter me. Your illness isn't fully cured yet; why did you come running over? You don't need to rush to thank me..."

The Leopard Head said, "I heard that Master Yang is going down the mountain to inspect the various manors?"

"That's right."

The Leopard Head puffed out his chest. "Master Yang, take me with you. Although I am not talented, my martial arts are passable. I am willing to follow Master Yang and act as your guard."

Yang Can hadn't originally thought of taking the Leopard Head down the mountain because the latter wasn't fully recovered yet. But hearing these words, Yang Can’s eyes lit up.

Suddenly, Yang Can remembered something and couldn't help asking, "By the way, you are originally from Feng'an Village?"

The Leopard Head replied, "Yes. My wife still lives in the village. We have six acres of land. My wife usually does some needlework."

If a family lacks strong male labor and relies only on a woman, they can usually farm at most three acres. Although rural women work in the fields like men, there is one core heavy labor that most women cannot do: plowing. Unless, of course, the family owns an ox.

The Leopard Head was one of the few self-sufficient farmers in Feng'an Village. Because he worked at the manor and had some spare money, he owned an ox. Therefore, even without strong labor, the Cheng family could farm six acres.

Yang Can thought for a moment and said happily, "Alright, I will take you down the mountain. If everything goes smoothly this trip, it will be a credit for you."

The Leopard Head agreed joyfully. Yang Can added, "However, you cannot go down the mountain openly with me."

The Leopard Head was stunned. Yang Can said, "Since you are from Feng'an Village, then..."

Yang Can moved closer and whispered into the Leopard Head's ear. The Leopard Head nodded repeatedly.

Yang Can needed to bring a few people on this inspection trip.

First, he needed an accountant. Yang Can decided to take Li Damu, who was so busy he hadn't had time to help organize the accounts yet.

Additionally, he needed to bring some guards. Although Qing Mei was accompanying him, and Suo Chanzhi could use this as an excuse to send some skilled Suo family guards, on the surface, Yang Can and Qing Mei were like fire and water. Therefore, he had to bring some Yu family guards.

Now that Li Youcai had gone down the mountain, Yang Can decided these matters himself without needing to consult anyone.

While Yang Can was preparing to go down the mountain, the Leopard Head quietly disappeared.

Before Cheng Dakuan disappeared, his wife had already taken the child down the mountain first. Because the Cheng family had elderly to care for, now that the Leopard Head had recovered, Mrs. Cheng had to hurry back.

Regarding Cheng Dakuan's disappearance, the first person to run to Yang Can to inquire was actually Liu Yu, who had been dying to see Cheng Dakuan fall.

"The Gate Master doesn't seem to like the Leopard Head, so I sent him to Chicken Goose Mountain. Is there something you need, Commander Liu?"

"Ah, no, no. Raising poultry is good! Raising poultry can cultivate one's character, haha.咳, then I won't disturb you, Master Yang. I take my leave."

Seeing that Yang Can seemed somewhat dismissive of him, Liu Yu tactfully shut his mouth.

As soon as he turned around, he sneered and curled his lip.

*Because I treated the Leopard Head too harshly, Yang Can looks down on me?*

*Hmph, so what if you look up to me? Can you make me stand out? Can you give me wealth and a bright future?*

*Pah! You're nothing!*

After dinner, Yang Can strolled over to Li Damu's residence.

He could directly transfer the guards from Liu Yu, but accountants belonged to management, so he needed to give a heads-up first. At least let them prepare and handle the handover of affairs.

Qiao She walked into Li Damu's room, holding a stack of account books that almost blocked her view.

"Master Li, the Young Mistress asks the accounting office to check these books and compile a general ledger."

Qiao She said, wiping the sweat from her forehead with her sleeve.

Several strands of black hair stuck to her moist forehead, and her face was red as a ripe apple from exhaustion.

After being punished by Suo Chanzhi with a slap, she had been demoted to a messenger girl.

Qiao She used to be just a servant waiting on Suo Chanzhi, but now she is a messenger girl for the inner residence.

Wealthy families strictly distinguish between the inner and outer residences. When people from the outer residence need to pass a message to the inner residence, or vice versa, if they don't need to go in person, they need a runner like this.

Therefore, messenger girls are also called "running girls," abbreviated as "messenger."

Among the servants of the inner residence, the messenger girl has the lowest status.

For Suo Chanzhi, this was a counterattack against the Lady's infiltration.

However, suddenly falling to the status of the lowliest messenger girl in the inner residence was quite a blow to Qiao She.

She is now essentially a general laborer; anyone can order her around, and it's not limited to just delivering messages.

"Oh, it's Miss Qiao She!"

As soon as Li Damu saw Miss Qiao She, his eyes lit up.

This little girl is quite pretty. She was originally given to the young master by the Lady as a personal servant, so of course she is pretty.

In Li Damu's mind, Qiao She might have already warmed the young master's bed.

He didn't know that since Yu Chengye was hit by a poisoned arrow, his body had been severely weakened.

Yu Chengye thought it was just the aftereffect of the poisoned arrow. He didn't know it was because Yang Can's herbs for treating cattle and horses weren't the right cure.

Although Yang Can saved his life through random attempts, Yu Chengye's body was ruined.

However, no man would ever speak of such a thing. Even his own parents, he wouldn't want to mention it, so the Gate Master and his wife didn't know either.

Li Damu had drunk a few cups tonight and was slightly tipsy.

Looking at Miss Qiao She's fair little face and the strands of black hair sticking to her slightly sweaty neck, which set off her milky white skin, he was captivated.

Moreover, Qiao She had a petite figure. To Li Damu, this was the perfect type to play with on the bed, and he couldn't help but feel stirred.

As for the possibility that Miss Qiao She had already warmed the young master's bed, he didn't mind.

He wasn't planning to marry her as a wife; what's wrong with being a "fellow traveler" with the young master?

"What account books are these?" Master Li asked, walking over with a smile.

"Yin, the General Ledger of Income and Expenditure; the Monthly Stipend Ledger; the Gift Exchange Ledger; the Inner Kitchen Daily Usage Record; the Inner Residence Private Expense Log..."

Li Damu looked them over and started thinking. *The Young Mistress is checking these kinds of accounts; is she going to clean up the old staff in the inner residence?*

Naturally, Li Damu didn't want to do such an offending job.

*Hmm, tomorrow I'll split these books with the other accountants. If there's trouble, we'll share the burden.*

"Good, good. We, the accounting office, will check them as soon as possible."

Master Li put down the account books and walked over to Qiao She with a smile.

At this distance, in this era, it would be considered somewhat rude for ordinary men and women.

Qiao She sensed something was wrong and quietly moved aside.

Master Li smiled and asked, "Miss Qiao She, you were originally by the Young Mistress's side, so you had some status. How did you become a messenger girl?"

Qiao She felt a pang of sorrow and said凄然 (sorrowfully), "I am young and ignorant. I didn't know how to speak properly and offended the Young Mistress. I was so foolish, truly..."

She choked up and couldn't continue, tears welling up in her eyes instantly.

After being demoted to a messenger girl by Suo Chanzhi using the incident, she had hoped the Lady would save her from this suffering.

However, once the message was passed up, the Lady didn't show any reaction.

Compared to a daughter-in-law carrying the Yu family's child, she, a mere servant, was worthless.

She had been completely abandoned.

"Hehe, Qiao She, don't be too sad."

Li Damu hurriedly fished out a handkerchief from his sleeve and offered it to Miss Qiao She. The little girl had tears brimming in her eyes, looking pitiful.

*If you're going to cry, it should be because I, Li Damu, made you cry. What's the point of crying like this?*

Li Damu's smile made all the wrinkles on his face bloom like chrysanthemums.

"I, Li, have a bit of status in the main household. If I, Li, were to lose this old face and plead for you in front of the Young Mistress, hehe... However, Li has no relation to you; I have no reason to speak for you."

As Li Damu spoke, he moved closer to Qiao She.

Qiao She had tied an apron for convenience while working. The apron was tied tightly, creating a beautiful curve where the slender waist met the round hips.

Li Damu wasn't just an accountant; he also liked painting and was very sensitive to lines.

That greasy hand slid quietly toward that smooth curve...
