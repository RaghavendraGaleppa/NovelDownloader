# Chapter 58: The Supreme Cavern Nine Heavens Spirit Treasure Refinement Manual

More importantly, *Thunder Nourishes the Soul*, as a first-rank cultivation method, had a mutually reinforcing effect when practiced alongside *Thunder Nourishes the Body*! 

Progress in either technique would naturally promote advancement in the other. Given Han Yue's current mastery of *Thunder Nourishes the Body*, once he began cultivating *Thunder Nourishes the Soul*, he would experience a period of extraordinarily rapid progress. 

Together, these two techniques formed the true foundational cultivation method of the Divine Thunder Palace, one of the supreme sects.

The third secret manual was called *The Supreme Cavern Nine Heavens Spirit Treasure Refinement Manual*, which contained the Divine Thunder Palace's esoteric methods for refining third-rank Dao-receiving magical instruments. It included dozens of artifact refinement techniques perfectly suited to the palace's various longevity cultivation lineages.

The manual's contents were remarkably comprehensive. Beyond just refinement methods for various magical instruments, it contained extensive analysis and descriptions of third-rank materials—essentially serving as an encyclopedia of third-rank materials!

With just a quick scan, Han Yue identified several third-rank materials he already possessed, making him eager to study it in detail when time permitted.

Having just joined the sect and not even returned to its headquarters yet, Han Yue was already experiencing the vast gap between rogue cultivators and a top-tier sect. These three introductory manuals alone contained cultivation knowledge far beyond what most rogue cultivators could ever hope to obtain. 

He was so eager to begin closed-door cultivation that he could hardly wait to thoroughly master all three manuals. The knowledge within was exactly what he had long yearned for, and receiving it now stirred his heart profoundly.

However, this was not the place for secluded cultivation. After briefly skimming the manuals, Han Yue set them aside and continued his conversation with Li Changle, who had just awakened and had many questions of his own.

"Earlier, I heard that Qinglian Sword Sect cultivator mention that the *Mystic Glass Tortoise* had been killed. Do you know anything about that?" Li Changle asked. 

The *Mystic Glass Tortoise* was the very being that had suppressed him here, so news of his nemesis naturally piqued his interest.

"I only heard that the *Mystic Glass Tortoise* was cursed to death by the newly ascended Demon-Seeking Palace's Annihilation Immortal," Han Yue replied.

"Annihilation Immortal? Li Juexian of the Demon-Seeking Palace?"

"Yes, the Annihilation Immortal Li Zihan."

"She's already achieved longevity? What about Shi Xuan?"

"True Person Shi has also ascended to longevity. Both True Person Shi and True Person Li attained the longevity fruit within the last century."

Li Changle fell silent. 

On the path of cultivation, falling behind even a single step meant lagging perpetually. He had already been left far behind by these two peers who were once his equals.

Li Changle had always considered himself exceptionally talented, having advanced smoothly through cultivation without ever falling behind his peers. With powerful inheritances and continuous opportunities, he had gained formidable divine abilities with each breakthrough, making him the foremost among his generation in both combat prowess and cultivation.

Yet now, after three hundred years of stagnation, others had surpassed him. 

The longevity barrier was already difficult to cross, and with his fortunes waning while others rose, his path forward seemed increasingly arduous. Nevertheless, confidence in his own abilities kept his fighting spirit burning bright. This time, he would reappear before his peers as one striving to catch up.

"Disciple, do you have any unfinished business in these outer regions?" Li Changle asked. "We should return to the sect as soon as possible."

"You need to obtain your inheritance, accumulate merit, and begin refining your Dao-receiving artifacts. I also need to enter seclusion to adjust my mind and body. If you can forge your first Dao-receiving artifact before reaching the second rank, you can significantly enhance its refinement during your advancement, saving considerable time."

"Our Divine Thunder Palace's *Thunder Nourishes the Soul* technique is among the finest soul-forging methods below the third rank. Mastery allows second-rank cultivators to wield two third-rank artifacts. If you're fortunate enough to forge your first Dao-receiving artifact at the first rank, you may have the chance to forge a second at the second rank. This timing must be carefully managed."

Han Yue listened attentively to Li Changle's guidance—these were invaluable insights from a high-level cultivator.

"I have two close friends here," Han Yue said. "Once I bid them farewell, I can depart with you."

"Good. Go quickly. I'll wait for you here in three days."

Li Changle assumed Han Yue's friends were nearby, unaware they were actually tens of thousands of miles away. Han Yue didn't elaborate—with his speed, such distances were trivial.

After Li Changle departed northward at high speed, Han Yue soared through the skies on his own light, his heart ablaze with excitement as his path forward became clear.

Before long, he returned to Flesh Distribution Outpost. 

After nearly a month of cleanup efforts by numerous cultivators, the outpost had been largely restored. The corpses were gone, the roads cleared, and some ordinary folk had even begun returning to seek opportunities.

Han Yue arrived at the former site of Courtyard Nine, where three simple wooden houses now stood. Fang Yi and Xiao Liu were overjoyed to see him return at last.

"Brother Blade, you're finally back!"

The three surviving members of Courtyard Nine reunited, reminiscing about the days when their group had feasted and drank together in this very place. A heavy silence fell over them as memories surfaced.

Naturally, their conversation turned to future plans.

Flesh Distribution Outpost occupied a strategic location along a passage to the outer regions, falling under the Qinglian Sword Sect's jurisdiction. Given the recent catastrophe, the sect had naturally intervened.

From Fang Yi and Xiao Liu, Han Yue learned of the Qinglian Sword Sect's plans. 

The outpost was simply too remote, and with the sect having few disciples to spare, they had no intention of establishing a permanent branch here. Instead, they would rebuild Flesh Distribution Outpost under new management.

The Qinglian Sword Sect would station a third-rank cultivator to reestablish a sword-affiliated faction and guard the outpost for a century. However, learning from past failures, this faction would take a more active role in daily operations, ensuring resources were used to nurture talented disciples rather than indulging any single group's desires.

Moreover, the sect had raised the standards for establishing new factions. Now, only those with second-rank combat prowess could become faction leaders—meaning Fang Yi no longer qualified unless Han Yue remained.

Han Yue then shared his own plans: in three days, he would depart for the northern Luzhou Continent to formally join the Divine Thunder Palace as a disciple. 

This meant Fang Yi and Xiao Liu would need to join existing factions if they wished to stay. 

At this, Fang Yi spoke up: "Han Yue, after everything that's happened, Xiao Liu and I don't want to stay in Flesh Distribution Outpost anymore. This place isn't the home we remember. We've decided to take the Beast Taming Sect's entrance examination."
