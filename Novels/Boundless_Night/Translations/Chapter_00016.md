Chapter 16: Annihilating the Enemy

The snow ape was cleaved into two halves with a single strike, a sight that sent chills down Shao Chengfeng and Feng Yi'an’s spines, making them instinctively retreat. They once again doubted whether their leader, Fu Entao, could truly handle Qin Ming.

Fu Entao’s expression shifted slightly, but his attack remained unaffected. Exploiting the opening Qin Ming created while dodging the snow ape, his shining long saber sliced through the swirling snow and wind, cutting horizontally with immense, unparalleled power.

Qin Ming seemed to have anticipated this. He raised his spear with his left hand, blocking it behind him as if carrying it on his back, then leapt forward. Using the momentum from Fu Entao’s ferocious chop on his iron spear shaft, he accelerated his charge. Ordinary people wouldn't dare do this, as even if not instantly killed, they would be severely injured by such a powerful force, perhaps even coughing up mouthfuls of blood. Qin Ming was unharmed, and with a single bound, he was upon his target.

The burly patroller felt his hair stand on end. This opponent was coming straight for him, as ferocious as a giant beast of the mountains. Upon landing, a bright flash of saber light immediately swept towards him. He quickly swung his saber in retaliation, intending to clash blades, but in an instant, he felt his grip on the hilt weakening—the opponent’s strength was overwhelming. After two brief, rapid collisions, the soft flesh between his fingers was torn, blood flowing freely and staining the saber hilt. He could no longer hold his weapon.

*Puff!*

Illuminated by the fiery spring, a brilliant saber light flashed, and his head was sent flying. His body crashed to the ground with a thud.

Qin Ming sharply turned, using his iron spear to block Fu Entao’s long saber, then menacingly looked at Feng Yi’an and Shao Chengfeng. The two men in the back were panicked. Normally, they were ruthless individuals, their temperaments like jackals—vicious, cunning, and skilled. But this young man before them was too brutal, killing without a word, which sent shivers down their spines.

A shadow also appeared in Fu Entao’s heart. The pressure from this young man, a 'second new-born', was immense. Every spear thrust and saber strike vibrated his arms slightly numb. At this moment, he desperately wanted to leave, to escape into the depths of the dark mountains, but he feared leaving his back exposed to the opponent after showing cowardice, which could lead to a fatal chain of kills.

Qin Ming spoke, “There are seven heads to be claimed at the stronghold on the mountain. Four have already fallen. Only three of you remain.”

Fu Entao was startled, then his face darkened. This young man was counting the Golden Mastiff, the Snow Ape, and the five of them together, treating them as equivalent to two mere beasts? Shao Chengfeng and Feng Yi’an tightened their grips on their iron spear and long saber, respectively. If anyone dared to belittle them like this on a normal day, they wouldn't know how to write the word 'death'.

Qin Ming intended to provoke their rage because he sensed that the trio was faltering, likely harboring thoughts of escape. He feared he wouldn't be able to catch the ‘second new-born’ Fu Entao if he fled. Indeed, the shadow that had just appeared in Fu Entao’s heart was stimulated away. In this area, even the veteran leaders of other patroller groups wouldn’t dare to humiliate him like this. Fu Entao had accumulated so much over the years, he was on the verge of advancing, almost touching the threshold of the next realm.

“Is he Qin Ming from Twin Tree Village?” Fu Entao asked the two men behind him. Earlier, when they discussed the Blood Bamboo Forest, Feng Yi’an and Shao Chengfeng had both mentioned Qin Ming, intending to use this young man with a golden foundation to scout ahead and then eliminate him.

“It’s him,” the bearded Feng Yi’an nodded.

Fu Entao nodded back, then spoke coldly, “Alright. When we go back, we’ll raze Twin Tree Village to the ground. Not a single man, woman, or child will be left. During special phases, after the mountain-clearing operation begins, it’s normal for an unexpected ‘famous beast’ to occasionally emerge from the deep mountains and massacre a village.” A cold smile, seemingly laced with blood, appeared on his face as he slowly raised his long saber.

Qin Ming was not enraged; he wanted to stir up their emotions so they wouldn’t lose the courage to fight and flee too quickly. He added fuel to the fire, saying, “Was what I just said about you wrong? Redglow City gives you high salaries, and the villagers respect you, willing to accept reduced harvests from their fire fields just to help the patroller group plant Black Moon herbs. How did you repay them? You drained the pond to catch all the fish, sucked the marrow from their bones, wishing you could consume all the spiritual essence in the fire spring, regardless of how many people would starve to death in the coming famine. You even casually killed innocent villagers for intimidation and deterrence. In your eyes, those lives are not even worth a muntjac, much less the Golden Mastiff you raise. Do you still have a human heart or humanity? Is it wrong to group you with fierce dogs and snow apes? You are far more harmful than they are. Think of the late old leader of the patroller group, and those responsible patrollers from other groups—you are simply not worthy of being named alongside them.”

Qin Ming spoke calmly, without excitement or anger, his voice not even raised. Yet, this caused veins to bulge on Fu Entao’s hand gripping the saber. He said nothing, pressing forward offensively. Even Feng Yi’an and Shao Chengfeng turned murderous, wishing they could instantly kill this calmly speaking young man who pierced straight into their core.

Qin Ming attacked first. Even wielding the relatively heavy iron spear with one hand, he controlled it as if it were an extension of his arm. The sharp spear tip thrust out, leaving streaks of afterimages, stirring up the swirling goose-feather snow. As Fu Entao tilted his head to dodge, the spear tip pierced through a bowl-sized larch behind him. Qin Ming gripped the spear shaft and gave a slight powerful swing, and the tree trunk snapped with a *crack*. Immediately, the chopping saber in his other hand also slashed out.

In an instant, saber lights flashed between the two, their offense and defense extremely perilous. Wherever they passed, large swathes of forest trees fell, their destructive power astonishing. When they reached the vicinity of the fiery spring, with a boom, a large wooden house exploded into splinters under the impact of their saber lights.

Fu Entao, nearly two meters tall, originally exuded immense pressure, but now he was gasping for breath, white mist rising from his naturally curly long hair. He was alarmed, feeling utterly exhausted, his arms numb from the vibrations, while his opponent remained as fierce as ever. If not for his superior speed, he would have undoubtedly fallen already. He had a realization: his opponent’s speed seemed to be a weakness. Just then, he found an opportunity. Feng Yi’an and Shao Chengfeng seized the moment when Qin Ming thrust his spear and swung his saber, both unleashing their full power in a sudden assault.

“Clang!”

An ear-splitting clash of saber and spear erupted. Qin Ming blocked Shao Chengfeng’s iron spear with his chopping saber, then quickly used the saber’s flat to push away Feng Yi’an’s long saber. At this critical juncture, Fu Entao was like a human tiger-wolf, incredibly fierce, his hair flying in the wind and snow. His eyes became extremely sharp as he gripped his long saber with both hands, striking down one blow after another, giving his all. He noticed that when Qin Ming used his spear with one hand to counter, it didn't have the same force as before; it seemed he was about to be suppressed. He roared, “Go all out and kill him!”

Qin Ming used his chopping saber to fend off the other two, while his left-hand iron spear was being suppressed by Fu Entao’s continuous saber chops, appearing precarious. Several times, in dangerous clashes, he chose a mutually destructive tactic, letting Fu Entao’s long saber chop down while his spear tip continued to thrust forward, forcing the opponent to retreat.

Fu Entao revealed a cold smile. Who had he ever feared in a battle of ruthlessness? He suddenly leaped forward, only bothering to avoid vital points on his upper body, swinging his shining long saber down at Qin Ming. Simultaneously, sinister grins appeared on Feng Yi’an and Shao Chengfeng’s faces. They cooperated perfectly, blocking all of Qin Ming’s retreat paths, wielding their long saber and iron spear together, forcing Qin Ming’s chopping saber to be used solely for blocking their attacks.

Qin Ming could not retreat, nor did he have time to dodge Fu Entao’s long saber from the front. At this moment, he didn't hesitate, choosing to accelerate his forward rush. There was no time to raise his long spear high, so its trajectory remained unchanged. With a *puff*, it pierced through Fu Entao’s thigh, completely impaling him. Although Fu Entao’s face twitched, he became even colder. In this kind of bloodied exchange of injuries, he only lost a leg, but the long saber he was chopping down from mid-air could cleave the opponent into two.

At the critical moment, Qin Ming’s chopping saber in his right hand was still dealing with the other two. He abandoned the iron spear, raised his left arm, and directly withstood the sharp long saber. Fu Entao sneered disdainfully; he believed he would chop off both the arm and the person. Feng Yi’an and Shao Chengfeng also laughed. No one knew better than them how terrifying a strike from their two-meter-tall leader, chopping down, could be. They felt as if they could already see the bloody scene.

However, a trembling *clang* sound rang out, accompanied by an extremely grating metallic friction. Things were not going as they imagined. Qin Ming’s outer clothing on his arm shattered, revealing the specialized armor worn by patroller group members, and he was wearing more than one layer. While this armor was not as refined as leader Fu Entao’s, Qin Ming wore three layers, which was enough to block the strike. If not for the extreme bulkiness, Qin Ming might have worn the armor of all four men he had killed down the mountain.

With a thud, Fu Entao staggered after landing from mid-air. His thigh was impaled, the iron spear still lodged within, and blood flowed profusely. He could no longer stand steadily.

Feng Yi’an turned and left without the slightest hesitation, incredibly decisive. He knew that the entire patroller group was likely going to be wiped out. Shao Chengfeng also realized that Qin Ming’s previous weakness was merely a deliberate misdirection, and he immediately fled.

Qin Ming picked up an iron spear from the ground, leaped into the air, and threw it with force. At such close range, it was a guaranteed hit. The iron spear flew at extreme speed, from top to bottom, and with a *puff*, it pierced through Feng Yi’an’s back, nailing him to the ground! “Ah…” he screamed in pain, not dying instantly, struggling futilely where he lay.

The moment Qin Ming landed, he pursued the other man. His speed was slightly inferior to Fu Entao’s, but catching Shao Chengfeng was too easy. Shao Chengfeng would not simply wait for death; he turned and wielded his iron spear in fierce resistance, but it was futile. His right arm was chopped off by Qin Ming’s saber. The iron spear fell to the ground, picked up by Qin Ming, who then mercilessly used the long spear to pin Shao Chengfeng in place, instantly staining the spot with blood.

Qin Ming stood in the clearing and spoke, “If none of you had fled, and just fought to the death here, I think I would have dealt with you all much earlier. I had to be distracted during the process, fearing that one of you might escape. Even if one got away, it would mean my mission this time was a failure.”

“You…” Fu Entao propped himself with his long saber, so enraged he almost spat out a mouthful of blood, believing Qin Ming was spouting nonsense.

“Clashing blades with you while distracted was indeed difficult for me, but I only just became a new-born recently, so it’s excusable,” Qin Ming reflected on the battle.

“What?!” Fu Entao’s expression froze, his heart trembling. He refused to believe that his opponent had just become a new-born, unable to accept such a fact.

“You truly haven’t undergone a second awakening yet,” Feng Yi’an spat out a mouthful of blood, giving a miserable laugh. He knew it was completely over; they had actually encountered such an unbelievable monster.
