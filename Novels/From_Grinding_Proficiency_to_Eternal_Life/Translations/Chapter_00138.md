# Chapter 138: Bao Yan

He was forced to leap forward, simultaneously swinging the chain hammer to hook onto a suddenly hollow section of the corridor bridge. With a slight flick of his wrist, a surge of natural power rose. A swing of the chain hammer sent him flying to another corridor bridge. Another flick, and the chain hammer rapidly retracted, transforming into a Lei Huo Qilin Hammer.

Fortunately, the Lei Huo Qilin Hammer was forged by Zhan Yan, who had swallowed his pride to invite the Mechanism Hall to collaborate on its creation. Otherwise, even with his "Flying Leg" technique at perfection, traversing this place would require extreme caution. A slight misstep would send him plummeting into the Tiangong City below, a drop of three hundred meters.

Before the words had fully faded, the entire corridor bridge Xu Yunfan was sprinting on suddenly disintegrated.

Three hundred and sixty bridge planks turned into flying blades, raining down on Xu Yunfan like a storm.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. He spun around, wielding the hammer in a circular motion. Amidst the surging winds of the hammer, he caught a glimpse of a figure clad in heavy玄铁 armor at the bridge pier—it was none other than the missing Pavilion Master of the Hidden Blade Pavilion, Bao Yan!

The man's face bore a trace of indescribable fanaticism. Seeing Xu Yunfan effortlessly block the flying blades, he realized that the mechanisms here were useless against him.

"It's a pity you chose to take the Tiangong Corridor Bridge. I wasted the fire and thunder devices I set up in Tiangong City. Even a Blood Transformation expert would never escape."

"Dog traitor!"

Xu Yunfan's gaze turned heavy and cold. He glanced around, and upon confirming that no one else was present, he let out a breath.

"Hall Master Bao, I've heard that your Qi and Blood have already passed their peak over the years, and your strength has dropped to merely half-step Blood Transformation?"

Bao Yan squinted slightly, surprised. "Do you think you can defeat me? Although you have perfected the Bone and Sinew refinement, unmatched in all of Cangzhou, looking at the entire Yanbei Dao, there are many who surpass you. There are even those who have perfected the Three Refinements. Why be so arrogant here?"

Xu Yunfan let out a soft laugh, his demeanor unhurried.

"Hall Master Bao, having defected to the Incense Fire Sect, surely you don't wish to be like Zhou Yuande, bowing to the Incense Fire Ming Lord to pray for longevity?"

"I am not a member of the Incense Fire Sect."

Bao Yan's face showed a hint of mockery. "The Incense Fire Sect isn't qualified enough for me to bow my head to them."

"Then why act as a spy?"

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan shifted the Lei Huo Qilin Hammer onto his back. The mechanism lock engaged instantly, securing the nearly four-hundred-pound heavy hammer. He patted the fine steel box he carried on his back; he hadn't taken it off even in Cuibo City.

"Spy?"

Bao Yan's face twisted into a smile of absurdity, the aged skin creasing into lines of ridicule.

"All land under the sky is the King's land; all men within the seas are the King's subjects. I remain loyal to the Great Zhou Empress who holds the Mandate of Heaven. Where is the spy in that?"

As he spoke, Bao Yan even cupped his hands towards the northeast in a虚拱, the black gold threads wrapped around his wrists glinting with a cold light in the twilight.

Xu Yunfan's boot ground against the floor of the corridor bridge. Catching a glimpse of the rotating gears through a crack, he silently took a step back. The chain of the Lei Huo Hammer in his hand emitted a faint metallic friction sound.

"Calling the massacre of a city 'holding the Mandate of Heaven'—Hall Master Bao's tongue must be redder than the branding irons of the Melting Gold Hall."

"I see!"

Xu Yunfan's heart cleared, and he nodded slightly. "You're quite bold to admit it."

"Now that Cangzhou has been chosen as the sacrificial ground, my mission is complete, and I should withdraw. However, eliminating a talent like you along the way would be a great benefit to the Great Zhou."

Bao Yan paused, then changed the subject.

"Xu Yunfan, originally a servant of the Jiang family, exiled to Ningguta by the陛下. Who would have thought that upon reappearing, you would cross Wuzhou and come to Qingzhou to seek apprenticeship. Interesting. Did you choose that name yourself?"

Xu Yunfan's heart trembled, his pupils contracting. He truly hadn't expected Bao Yan to see through his origins in one go.

Seeing Xu Yunfan remain silent, a smile appeared on Bao Yan's face.

"You think you've hidden yourself well? Within the Great Zhou, nothing can be concealed. From the day you settled in Qingzhou, the hounds of the Black Armor Guards caught your scent.

You have good aptitude, and I am someone who cherishes talent. I can give you a chance to atone for your crimes. Now that the Tiangong Cave is on the verge of destruction, and the other seven sects in Cangzhou all have our people inside, acting in concert, a sect like this is as good as dead."

Xu Yunfan lowered his eyelids, hiding his emotions. "I wonder what method Hall Master Bao has for me to atone for my crimes?"

"Kill Zhan Yan and destroy Tiangong City. This is a great merit. Perhaps you will even receive a reward from the陛下, allowing you to shed your lowly status and obtain an official position."

"I am truly..."

Before he could finish, the force generated by Xu Yunfan's foot arch shattered the floor tiles within a zhang.

The fine steel box on his back deformed and cracked in the midst of his charge, revealing the dragon-head pommel of a half-sectioned gilded mace. The force from his steps turned him into an arrow leaving the string, his figure tearing through the wind.

"Thank you, Hall Master Bao!"

Bao Yan's eyes flashed with intensity. The black gold threads in his fingers tightened abruptly. Ripples appeared in the air within a radius of ten zhang—it was the Sky-Ensnaring Net laid out by the Hundred-Refined Coiling Silk Strength!

Facing Bao Yan's furious face rapidly enlarging in his vision, Xu Yunfan reached back to grab the handle of the gilded mace on his back. Suddenly, his eyes moved, and he forcefully halted his charge, turning his head to look at Mo Shisan charging up from below.

"Be careful of the old dog's Coiling Silk Strength! Stop!"

As Mo Shisan's roar came from below, thirty-six silver lights exploded from the ground.

In mid-air, the mechanical armor on his body disintegrated with a crash. Three hundred and sixty pieces of meteoric iron armor blades slashed at the void, attempting to sever the heavenly silkworm threads in front of Bao Yan.

Bao Yan looked at the halted Xu Yunfan with some regret. The heavenly silkworm threads were nearly invisible to the naked eye yet as tough as steel wires. If Xu Yunfan had charged over at his previous speed, he would have been shredded into countless pieces of flesh.

How could Bao Yan let Mo Shisan succeed? With a slight flick of his fingers, he pulled on the black gold threads with his Hundred-Refined Coiling Silk, and the sword on his back unsheathed, shooting towards the blades flying at Mo Shisan.

Amidst the clang of metal, the corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth twitched. He stepped forward again, his charging momentum suddenly accelerating. His body carried the sound of wind and thunder, the veins on his neck bulging like a python coiling around a tree.

The next second, Mo Shisan's expression turned to horror, and Bao Yan's eyes nearly popped out of his head.

They saw Xu Yunfan's muscles vibrating with a strange frequency. Using his body-forging technique, he actually rammed through the heavenly silkworm threads head-on.

Simultaneously, he reached back and grabbed the Lei Huo Qilin Hammer. As his Qi and Blood surged, the lava-like lines on the hammer handle lit up, and arcs of electricity flickered around the hammer head from time to time.

The air roared, torn and surging back. Amidst the piercing shriek, the heavy hammer descended upon Bao Yan's head with the killing move of the Thirty-Six Paths of Gale Hammer, like a reversed Milky Way.

Bao Yan, unable to retreat in time, had his eyes split wide with rage. He raised his hands clad in meteoric iron gauntlets to meet the falling hammer head head-on.

*Boom!*

Along with a grating sound of bones vibrating, the ground beneath Bao Yan's feet shattered. This section of the Tiangong Corridor Bridge trembled violently, and gears occasionally shot out from the bridge, making Mo Shisan's eyelids twitch in the distance.

He had personally participated in the construction of the Tiangong Corridor Bridge.

(Completed 10,000 words. Thank you all for your support. Recently, the plot has been a large continuous arc, starting from the purple-robed old man in Wuzhou to the current crisis in the Tiangong Cave. Since it was truly written word by word, it takes time to present. Some readers feel uncomfortable and find it confusing, which is very distressing. I will try to avoid this narrative style in the future. Thank you all.)
