**Chapter 75: Guaranteed Spot in the Top Eight; Elder Qian Definitely Placed a Bet**

Lin Jiang seemed to grasp his meaning. Since he couldn't win anyway, he might as well surrender directly. It made perfect sense.

Li Mo was momentarily speechless, unable to retort, and could only say with a wry smile, "Thank you for going easy on me."

"Thank you, Brother Li, for your generosity." Lin Jiang breathed a sigh of relief.

And so, Jade Peak achieved victory in its first battle. They had spoken of competing to show strength and foster friendship, yet this match, in the eyes of the crowd, truly embodied nothing but friendship.

Among the inner sect disciples:
"There's definitely something shady going on!"
"I know Lin Jiang; he dared to fight a late-stage Rank 9 exotic beast during the sect trials."
"Something was profoundly amiss."

Amidst the buzzing discussions of the Divine Weapon Peak inner sect disciples, Wang Hao watched the young man leisurely descend from the stage, a cold glint flashing in his eyes. Since Wang Hu entered Ruyi Peak, he had never come out. Even Wang Hao himself, due to his kinship with Wang Hu, was taken by Ruyi Peak's enforcement disciples for three days of interrogation. Only then did Wang Hao understand the reason: Wang Hu had become entangled with the Demon Summoning Cult, a group of demonic cultivators strictly forbidden by the Great Yu Dynasty, to be killed without mercy by any sect upon discovery.

"Senior Brother Wang, it's your turn to go on stage." A fellow disciple beside him reminded.
Wang Hao snapped back to attention and ascended the competition stage. He faced a True Disciple in the Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm. While Wang Hao also displayed an aura of the Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm, he was significantly older than his opponent, and his martial arts cultivation was considerably deeper. The two exchanged blows, fighting fiercely until the battle reached a fever pitch. Finally, it concluded with Wang Hao's victory.

After defeating his opponent, Wang Hao did not retract his intimidating aura. His gaze, sharp as a blade, swept across Li Mo. The hostility and declaration of war were unmistakable. Seeing Wang Hao in this state, Li Mo, on the contrary, felt a sense of relief. Finally, he wouldn't have to worry about not getting to fight. If every opponent jumped off the ring to surrender, his Nine Peaks Martial Arts Competition would be utterly devoid of experience.

Of course.
He shouldn't encounter opponents who surrender directly in every battle, right?
According to the famous Murphy's Law, the more you hope something doesn't happen, the more likely it is to happen.

The next match.
On the ring, two old acquaintances looked at each other in silence.
"Brother Li." Murong Xiao looked at him, revealing a shy smile.
Li Mo: "..."
He looked at Elder Qian, who was responsible for the lottery, with considerable suspicion. Elder Qian lightly inhaled, also looking utterly perplexed. How did this kid draw another acquaintance?

Murong Xiao was also a quite popular disciple of the Qingyuan Sect. Although only in the Qi and Blood Realm, relying on his half-demon physique and exquisite body tempering, he had already defeated several opponents with higher cultivation than him. In terms of performance, his strength was even higher than Lin Jiang's. If he had a bit more luck, he would have a chance to enter the top sixteen.

On the high platform.
"Murong Xiao, the Kylin Prodigy of Ziyang Prefecture."
"In this battle, he should display his full strength, right?"
The white-robed young master looked at Murong Xiao with a mix of appreciation and intense fighting spirit. He was the chief disciple of this generation, on whom Fenyu Lin placed high hopes! He also possessed a half-demon physique. Kylin Prodigy of Ziyang Prefecture? That title should belong to him!

From the Red Whale Gang's side, the Blood-robed Young Master remained silent, but his eyes had already narrowed. He couldn't discern the depth of that young man's power, just like Ying Bing.

"Han He, what do you think?" After Qian Bufan asked, the others also looked towards the Divine Weapon Peak Elder. It was well known that Elder Han He was rigid in nature and stubborn in temperament, so he definitely wouldn't engage in any shady dealings. Therefore, this match would certainly be fair. Unexpectedly, Han He shook his head:
"Murong Xiao is no match for Li Mo."
The admission was remarkably blunt, leaving the elders bewildered. As a master, he must have understood Murong Xiao's strength, yet he affirmed that Murong Xiao would lose without even thinking? If that were the case, there was only one possibility: True Disciple Li indeed possessed a strength that commanded Elder Han He's acknowledgment.

"It seems my grand-disciple might truly give us some surprises," Xue Jing said with a chuckle, turning his gaze to the arena.

However, Qian Bufan's voice came:
"Murong Xiao surrenders."
"Li Mo, wins!"

This time, the elders didn't say anything, their expressions thoughtful. The other disciples watching, and people from outside sects, couldn't understand at all. A wave of exclamations arose:
"Huh? Murong Xiao surrendered too?"
"He kept calling him 'Brother Li'; it seems he has a very good relationship with True Disciple Li, so he conceded?"
"Don't the elders do anything about this?"
"They say True Disciple Li has excellent connections; today I've seen it. He can even rely on his network to enter the top thirty-two?"
"If there are fixed matches, how could Elder Qian not know? I suspect he definitely placed a bet."

...
Waves of discussion and questioning filled the air.
Li Mo took a deep breath: "Brother Murong, you..."
"Brother Li looks like he's broken through again; I'm afraid you won't be able to hold back."
Murong Xiao shivered. He couldn't help but recall the scene of Li Mo striking in the Martial Arts Hall. He had honestly thought it was an earthquake.

"At least let's exchange a few moves, just for show." Li Mo felt helpless.

"I... I still want to make it to the top sixteen..." Murong Xiao also felt wronged. That massive Whale Breath Coral Stone was directly discolored from his strike. Brother Li hadn't even used any martial arts; one punch had the attack intensity of the Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm, and even a faint wisp of martial killing intent emanating from it made his scalp tingle. Now that he'd broken through, what then?

Li Mo didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Not a single fight, and he was in the top thirty-two. To say it was relying on connections... well, maybe it didn't count entirely. Where could he even go to explain this!

........

The morning matches concluded with Elder Qian's announcement of a half-time break. Later, two more rounds of battles were held. From the top thirty-two, they advanced all the way to the top eight. Those who fought their way through were all highly skilled, each displaying their unique abilities, making this arguably the most high-stakes Nine Peaks Martial Arts Competition in history. Among them were individuals like Wang Hao, whose age just barely met the participation cutoff, possessing profound accumulation and rich combat experience. There were also rising stars with exceptional talent like Murong Xiao. Of course, Ying Bing must be mentioned. Every time she went on stage, she crushed her opponents with absolute dominance, sweeping through the rounds, and each battle ended extremely quickly. Of course... there was someone faster than her. For instance, a certain True Disciple from Jade Peak who was "guaranteed a spot by connections" and hadn't even made a move yet... In short, the afternoon's martial arts competition promised to be full of highlights.

......

Qingyuan Main Peak, dining hall.
Li Mo, Murong Xiao, Xiao Qin, and Lin Jiang were seated at a table, eating. Looking at the three who were intently shoveling food, Li Mo felt a slight melancholy.
"Now, everyone in the sect is saying I got in through connections."
"Some even say I'm rigging matches."
"Do you guys have any insights?"
He had participated all morning but hadn't fought a single match. He had nowhere to expend his energy, leaving him inexplicably frustrated.

"Brother Li, if I fought you, I might not have been able to advance." Murong Xiao said awkwardly.
Lin Jiang nodded in agreement, feeling a sense of having narrowly escaped disaster:
"Brother Li, Hundred Flowers Dew Balm probably can't bring people back from the dead..."
Li Mo's mouth twitched slightly, then he looked to the side:
"Old Xiao, what about you? You're in the Inner Qi Realm; you should at least go through the motions with me."

"Huh?"
Xiao Qin currently had a bruised eye, his nosebleed plugged with paper, and his eyes were bewildered. He pointed at himself with a bandaged finger:
"Me?"
Old Xiao had bad luck. He encountered another True Disciple in the Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm and engaged in an all-out brawl with him, both sustaining injuries by the end. He barely managed a narrow victory, but his right hand was temporarily unusable due to the injury. Then, the next round, he ran into Li Mo.
