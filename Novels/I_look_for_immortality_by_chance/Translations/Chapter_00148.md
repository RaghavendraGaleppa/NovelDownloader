# Chapter 148: "I Am Your Wife, My Lord!"

The Western Sea Domain, the Myriad Isles Sea.

This boundless expanse, home to countless islands, was a paradise for demons and rogue cultivators alike. 

At the edge of a vast, majestic island adorned with carved railings, jade pavilions, and waterfalls where cranes soared, a figure suddenly plummeted from the void, crashing straight into the water.

The unconscious figure, though still harboring spiritual energy within, was unable to summon it and thus fell helplessly into the sea. Yet, as if protected by some divine mystery, the endless azure waters cradled the young man gently like a net, keeping him afloat without so much as dampening a single strand of his hair.

"Whoosh!"

Just then, a peculiar black fish with sharp teeth and wings on its back swam cautiously closer. Mistaking the motionless figure for a corpse, it suddenly lunged to bite.

"Clang!"

But at that moment, the phantom of a pagoda shimmered into existence, blocking the fish's attack with a faint tremor. Startled, the fish darted away, only to return moments later when the young man remained unresponsive. It spat a water arrow toward him.

The jade pagoda at the young man's waist stirred without wind, drawing upon his spiritual energy to intercept the strike.

"Swish!"

Yet before it could act, a silver crescent blade shot down from the island, slicing the fish cleanly in half. Seeing this, the jade pagoda stilled, ceasing its movements.

"How strange—someone actually fell from the sky! And today isn't even a stormy day!" 

A clear, melodious voice drew near across the water. 

A lively young maiden in a colorful dress approached, her arms as fair as lotus roots, golden bells adorning her feet. Though her aura was somewhat unsteady, she was unmistakably a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Behind her trailed several similarly dressed maidens, their skirts of varying hues, their cultivation only at the Qi Refining stage.

"Elder Sister Caiyun, this is the Myriad Isles Sea. Isn't it common for rogue cultivators to fight and fall from the sky? With the storm season nearing, even ten people dropping wouldn't be odd!" A green-robed girl giggled behind her hand, addressing the leading maiden with familiarity rather than deference.

"Exactly! Just this month, Sister Yun has already picked up four cultivators—two fleeing enemies, one caught in an expanded storm, and another..." A yellow-robed girl chimed in, her cheeks flushed, eyes brimming with mischief. "Well, he claimed he came to explore the 'romantic charms' of our Yinsu Island..."

"You little minx! Did you indulge him?" 

The yellow-robed girl giggled. "He was fair-skinned, charming, and sweet-talking. Why not? It wasn't me who suffered—he’ll need a long rest, though."

"Shameless!" her companions scolded playfully.

"Enough!" The leading maiden, Caiyun, suddenly grew serious. "This one’s a Foundation Establishment cultivator!"

The girls immediately sobered, falling silent as they followed her cautiously toward the figure on the water.

"Ah!" 

At first glance, their eyes sparkled with delight. 

"What a handsome young lord!" 

They exchanged glances, excitement evident. 

Caiyun, though equally impressed, remained vigilant, her lotus-shaped spiritual tool at the ready as she probed the unconscious man with her divine sense. After a moment, she relaxed. 

"He's alive—just unconscious, his sea of consciousness injured."

"Thank goodness! It’d be such a waste if he died!" The girls sighed in relief.

Caiyun smiled and swiftly clasped a gleaming silver ring around the young man's wrist. Though his body faintly resisted, his defenseless state made it effortless for her. 

"A Foundation Establishment cultivator indeed has protective treasures. But once the Binding Ring is on, even spiritual tools are useless." Satisfied, she then reached down and gave his lower half a quick squeeze, her face lighting up. 

"Elder Sister! How unfair! We want a turn too!" The girls protested, stamping their feet.

With a wave of her hand, Caiyun stopped them. "Enough! A Foundation Establishment cultivator isn’t for us to toy with. I’m taking him to the Second Madam."

At the mention of the Second Madam, the girls sighed in resignation, watching enviously as Caiyun carried the handsome youth toward a lavish palace on the island.

Gu Yuan’s head throbbed as if struck by a hammer. Despite his resilience, the pain was unbearable. Desperate to recall what had happened, he struggled to open his eyes and release his divine sense—only to be met with excruciating agony.

"Don’t move," a soft voice murmured. "Your sea of consciousness is injured. You mustn’t strain it. Here, drink this Soul-Nourishing Tea."

Gentle hands touched his lips, and warm liquid flowed down his throat. The pain receded slightly. Seizing the moment, Gu Yuan forced his eyes open and scanned his surroundings.

He lay in an opulent bedchamber, fragrant with incense, furnished only with an ivory jade bed and a white jade desk. To his shock, he realized he was cradled in the arms of a woman—her skin like snow, her dark hair piled high in an elegant chignon, her body clad in a sheer white peony gauze dress. Her eyes held the allure of spring waters, her curves ample yet graceful.

"Who are you?!" he demanded, recoiling.

The woman smiled coyly. "I am your wife, my lord!"
