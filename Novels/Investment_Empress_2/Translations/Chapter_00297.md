# Chapter 297: The Greenwood Camp and the Ya Zhi True Spirit

Creak, creak—

The carriage rolled through the streets of Greenwood City, heading straight for the Greenwood Camp. The camp was established within the city limits to guard against sudden emergencies.

Along the way, they increasingly saw armored soldiers patrolling in formation.

“Sigh...”

Young Master Li sat inside the carriage, his face deep in thought.

“Brother Li, are you thinking about how to deal with my military formation later? Getting nervous?” Zhong Zhenyue sat boldly, hands resting on his knees, grinning broadly.

A military formation diagram lay before him. After all, Brother Li had been preoccupied and serious the entire journey, so he had to show he was taking this seriously.

“Ah, it’s not just because of the military formation.”

“Oh? What else could make Brother Li this nervous?”

Zhong Zhenyue raised an eyebrow, quite curious.

“Ice... you’ve met Fairy Ice.”

“Yeah, of course.”

“This morning, she looked at me with *that* kind of look.”

Li Mo narrowed his eyes, lowering his gaze while lifting his chin, mimicking the Ice Cube’s expression. He captured about three-tenths of her essence.

“Sigh...”

Zhong Zhenyue leaned back reflexively, spilling the hot tea in his hand all over his lap.

“Based on your experience with women, what do you think it meant?”

“But I don’t have any experience in that area, Brother Li.”

“.....”

Li Mo recalled the time Zhong Zhenyue was drooling after being tricked by a seductress, and that was without her even using any mind-altering martial arts...

Great.

Asking him was a waste of time.

This guy probably has nothing but ‘fighting, awesome’ running through his head, on the same level as the brothers from the Gang Dou Sect.

Soon, they arrived at the Greenwood Camp. After the heavy gates opened, the two got down and walked in. Soldiers could be seen engaging in all sorts of drills.

Some were new recruits, mostly at the Qi and Blood Realm, practicing the most basic thrusts.

Others, at the peak of the Qi and Blood Realm, were stripped to the waist, sparring in pairs. They wrestled together like giant bears.

Sweat, muscles, a real man’s 1v1 battle...

The most elite were the archers, all at least at the Internal Breath Condensing Qi Realm. Many of them had features distinctly different from the Great Yu people, likely conscripted locally from the Southern Frontier.

“The Greenwood Camp, how many troops are stationed here? Is that okay to ask?” Li Mo asked, looking at the seemingly endless camp.

“Brother Li, why don’t you take a guess?”

“Three hundred thousand?”

Li Mo had seen TV shows where they talked about hundreds of thousands of troops or a million lions. Given how vast the camp looked, he felt he was being conservative.

“Haha, it’s eighty thousand.”

Zhong Zhenyue walked into the camp, his aura becoming a bit more imposing. “Three hundred thousand troops would be more like Nanguan City. In the past, Nanguan City truly had a million strong soldiers.”

Li Mo nodded.

He had heard his dad boast about it when he was drunk. In the past, there was no Greenwood City; Nanguan was the only barrier for Great Yu in the Southern Frontier. Back then, the disaster beasts were much more ferocious than they are now, and Nanguan faced the danger of falling several times.

“By the way, the Lu Yi you asked me to find hasn’t been located yet. It will take at least two or three days.”

“That’s quite fast. I wish every garrison in the region were as disciplined as the Greenwood Camp.”

“Father King is powerless to do more.”

Zhong Zhenyue understood what Li Mo meant. After a moment of silence, he said:

“His Majesty no longer values Nanguan as he used to, or perhaps it is no longer needed.”

Li Mo seemed to understand. After a moment of silence, he smiled and said:

“This means the Southern Frontier isn’t as prone to war anymore. That’s a good thing.”

“True. Brother Li, please.” Zhong Zhenyue also smiled. Ahead was the camp of his personal guards.

In the spacious drill ground, a team of about three to four hundred heavily armored soldiers was practicing a formation. Each one had a fierce aura and high spirits.

Commanding them was a heroic female general. She held a precious eagle bow in one hand and command flags in the other.

“His personal guards are battle-hardened elites with a terrifying killing intent.”

Li Mo’s heart stirred.

This aura was somewhat similar to what he sensed from the Ya Zhi True Spirit.

“While they finish their drill, how about we have a spar first, Brother Li?”

---

Zhong Zhenyue looked eager to try.

“Of course.” Li Mo drew the Chixiao Sword.

Having not used a sword for a long time, and having been exposed to the Ya Zhi True Spirit all night, Swordsman Li was also itching for a fight.

The Ya Zhi True Spirit governs swords and blades and enjoys conflict.

The two sparred for a while. Young Master Zhong’s skill had indeed improved greatly. Not only had his technique strengthened, but his experience had also become much more seasoned.

Li Mo used only sword techniques. It wasn’t until the eightieth move that Zhong Zhenyue showed signs of defeat.

A moment later.

The familiar sound of a system notification rang in Young Master Li’s ear.

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in ‘Zhong Zhenyue’ and helped him identify the flaws in his martial arts.】

【Investment Feedback: Hundred-Man Military Formation (Black Scale Formation)】

A military formation technique?

Young Master Li figured he wasn’t going to be a soldier.

He wondered how this formation compared to the Zhong Family Iron Formation of the King of the South.

“Given time, once I enter the Internal Scene, I will surely be able to shed the nickname ‘Eight-Armed Young Dragon’.”

Zhong Zhenyue was drenched in sweat, leaning on his spear, his eyes shining.

He lost, but he improved significantly.

“So nicknames can be changed?”

“Of course. What was Brother Li’s nickname again?”

“Hmm, Lone Wolf Strange Sword!”

Li Mo emphasized seriously.

As they were talking, Li Mo’s ears suddenly twitched, but he didn’t make a move.

*Thwip—*

An arrow landed three inches in front of his foot, its fletching trembling violently.

The female general standing before the command platform spoke out:

“The eleventh-ranked genius on the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List), can’t even dodge a stealth arrow? Could it be that your ranking is entirely due to...”

“Wang Qi (Helpful Wife)?”

Li Mo: “.....?”

Young Master Li’s face instantly turned black.

Why bring up the thing I hate most?!

Zhong Zhenyue glanced at Brother Li’s sleeve. Seeing that he was still holding the hammer, he sighed in relief. Then he put on a stern face and scolded:

“Zhong Ling, how could Brother Li possibly fail to dodge your arrow? He just didn’t want to bother with you. Since he’s still holding his sword, hurry up and apologize.”

Judging by her age, the female general called Zhong Ling was likely Zhong Zhenyue’s older sister.

“Hmph.”

Zhong Ling glared angrily at Zhong Zhenyue, then turned her gaze to Li Mo:

“You wanted to challenge my Zhong Family formation? I’ll command it, and Zhenyue will be the vanguard. Will the Hidden Dragon and Sea Dragon dare to accept?”

“Exactly what I was thinking.”

Li Mo put away the Chixiao Sword.

He had intended to use the killing intent of the military to temper himself, to better accommodate the Ya Zhen True Spirit.

Zhong Zhenyue: “!”

Why am I the vanguard?

I never agreed to that!

Zhong Ling is usually a bit hot-tempered, but she isn’t reckless. What’s gotten into her today?

“By the way, let’s add a wager.”

“Sure. If you lose, you’ll work as a cook for my personal guards for a few days.”

Zhong Ling seemed to have planned this all along.

“Fine.”

“If you lose, you’re never allowed to call me the ‘Wang Qi Dou Hun’ (Helpful Wife Fighting Soul) again!”

Li Mo took off his upper shirt, revealing a torso like a leopard.

Muscles full of power were now wreathed in dark light and a thick, sharp aura of military slaughter.

Behind him, a fierce beast shadow faintly appeared.

Ya Zhi!

Zhong Zhenyue: “.....”

Is it too late to withdraw?

I’m waiting online, it’s urgent.
