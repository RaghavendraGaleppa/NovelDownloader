**One Day Leave**

Today I had some matters to attend to. I've just sat down in front of my computer, and I feel that if I write in a hurry, the quality won't be very high. I'll do my best tomorrow and try to update earlier. This is also the first time I've taken a leave of absence with a dedicated chapter for this book, mainly because I returned too late today. Thank you to all my readers.
