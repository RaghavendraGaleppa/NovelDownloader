# Chapter 128: Surpassing Ying Bing, The Blood Phoenix Spirit Grass

Master Han raised an eyebrow.

His gaze was profound as he looked into the distance. He saw that the ranking inscriptions on the distant sky had changed at some unknown time.

‘First: Li Mo, 577 Beast Tokens.’

‘Second: Ying Bing, 240 Beast Tokens.’

‘Third: Bai Jinghong, 77 Beast Tokens.’

...

Master Han: “?”

To be honest.

Even with his perspective of having dominated for thousands of years, Ying Bing achieving such a degree was already terrifying enough.

Facing beasts of the same realm, or even those surpassing her own realm, she could kill over two hundred in a single hour.

That averaged out to two per minute.

Of course, the actual situation couldn't be calculated by this quantity alone; powerful White Bone Beasts carried more Beast Tokens as well.

But no matter how you looked at it.

Ying Bing’s performance could only be described with the four words: the qualification of invincibility.

Yet...

What the hell was with the first place?

Over five hundred?

Even if the White Bone Beasts stood still and let someone kill them, one couldn't kill them that fast, right?

The brows of the youth in the blood-red robe furrowed together.

He clearly remembered.

During the Nine Peaks Martial Assembly, although Li Mo could be considered a genius in the Eastern Wilderness Domain, there was still a gap compared to a shocking genius like Ying Bing.

Could it be that the秘境 (Secret Realm) had a problem? Allowing this person to find some clever trick?

“Master Han, should this subordinate go into the Secret Realm and capture him?” Yin Huaxuan asked softly.

“Let nature take its course. Pay him no mind.”

The blood-robed youth’s brows smoothed out again:

“As long as Ying Bing can come here, that is what matters.”

“Li Mo... is also a rare talent. We are currently in need of manpower. If he understands the principle of a good bird choosing its tree to perch on, that would be a fine matter.”

Being able to use tricks is also a kind of strength.

Besides, this person himself was one of the few in the Eastern Wilderness that he looked upon with some favor.

“This child is Shang Wu’s disciple. I’m afraid he is wild and hard to tame, stubborn and unyielding...” Yin Huaxuan had just said when the youth in the blood-red robe turned around, his lingering gaze sweeping over him indifferently.

“Shang Wu’s disciple, isn't that even better?”

Yin Huaxuan’s heart suddenly skipped a beat.

“It is his blessing to be able to serve Master Han.”

“But if this person doesn't know what's good for him...”

The youth in the blood-red robe said indifferently:

“If he is not used by me, then his only value is to become nourishment for the Blood Phoenix Essence.”

......

Layer One of the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

The vast pool of water had frozen over in many places.

A giant strange fish waved its massive White Bone tail, creating waves of black ripples in the pool to block the pervasive radiance.

However, the chilling Yin force still compressed its dodging space smaller and smaller.

The pool grew colder and colder.

So cold it felt as if time itself had frozen.

Suddenly.

*Swish—*

A wheel of clear brilliance fluctuated, carrying a snow-colored long sword as it descended from the air.

The White Bone giant fish struggled with all its might, only to find that its immense strength seemed to have vanished completely, unable to be exerted at all.

The snow-colored long sword passed through the void.

The layers of black water waves were pierced through.

*Slap—*

The long sword pierced through its forehead.

The Yin force scattered in all directions, freezing everything it touched into solid ice.

Soon.

The White Bone giant fish was frozen into a lifelike ice sculpture.

A string of bone tokens fell into the young girl’s slender hand, which she stored into the bag at her waist.

After finishing all this, Ying Bing finally raised her head, a hint of confusion in her eyes.

---

Firstly.

She still hadn't seen Han Zhen.

Could her memory be wrong? Or perhaps that person didn't obtain the Blood Phoenix Essence from this place?

And Li Mo.

How could he... be so fast?

“The top fifty can all enter the next layer.”

“There is no difference.”

She lowered her eyes for a moment.

Ying Bing’s thoughts moved.

The magnificent Phoenix Qi seemed to come to life, forming four wings behind her back. With a slight flap, ripples of radiance flowed past.

*Whoosh—*

The Phoenix wings spread, carrying her figure as she rode the wind and departed.

.....

On the other side.

Inside this cave, countless spider webs were spread everywhere. The webs looked light and thin, but in reality, even an Inner Qi Realm martial artist caught in them would be unable to move.

A White Jade Spider several zhang long was hissing as it lay atop the webs.

“Hengyun Sword Qi!”

Hundreds of sword shadows condensed, then suddenly merged into one.

*Sizzle sizzle sizzle—*

The White Jade Spider was covered in wounds, its body rapidly eroded by the sword qi.

“If I had used this move right from the start last time, I never would have lost!”

Bai Jinghong’s chest heaved.

Last time was a match. He hadn't used his true methods.

He was just caught off guard; he hadn't unleashed his true strength...

After collecting the Beast Token, he walked out of the cave.

But as soon as he looked up, Bai Jinghong’s expression froze completely.

........

At the same time.

Before a waterfall, water splashed everywhere.

Behind the waterfall was a dark stone wall. If one looked closely, they could see a small hole had been dug into it.

Inside the hole, a Blood Jade-colored small grass was placed, emitting a faint, strange fragrance. As it drifted with the wind, it looked like a Phoenix flying.

Naturally, the珍奇 (Treasure) was not without an owner.

Dozens of White Bone Apes were wandering in front of the pool.

Compared to ordinary White Bone Beasts, they appeared much more spiritual, and each one had an exceptionally powerful aura.

The weakest was Peak Eight-Rank, equivalent to the Inner Qi Xuan Dan Realm.

The strongest was actually Mid Seven-Rank.

Equivalent to the Five Apertures of the Divine Observation Realm.

Two figures, one large and one small, were poking their heads out from the nearby grass.

It was Xiao Qin and Tang Xiaobao.

Currently, their bodies were covered in thick black mud mixed with bone powder from strange beasts, using this method to isolate themselves from the detection of the White Bone Beasts.

“Senior Tang Xiaobao, you are truly amazing. It really is the Blood Phoenix Spirit Grass.”

Xiao Qin lowered his voice and said excitedly.

He had left behind secret signals along the way that only disciples of the Qingyuan Sect could understand. This was something Elder Qian had instructed everyone to do as soon as they entered the Secret Realm.

Sure enough, he had met Senior Xiaobao.

Senior Xiaobao seemed to have a unique method for finding treasures...

“Hmph, of course.”

Tang Xiaobao snorted lightly, preparing to jump out as he spoke.

“Senior Tang Xiaobao, what are you doing?”

“Of course, I’m going to get the grass. Don't you want the grass?”

“......”

Xiao Qin looked at Tang Xiaobao’s small frame, then at the dozen or so towering and fierce White Bone Apes not far away.

“I know you are very powerful, Senior, but we should plan this carefully.”

Just these dozen or so White Bone Apes were not something they could handle.

Even with the teacher helping, it would require a significant cost.

Moreover, even if they picked the spirit grass, who knows if there might be someone acting as the mantis stalked by the oriole?

“Old Xiao, Senior Xiaobao, what are you two whispering about?”

A familiar voice suddenly came from behind.
