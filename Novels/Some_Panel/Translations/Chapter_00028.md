# Chapter 28: Subduing the Earth Spirit Fire

Bang!

With the explosion of the last Thunderclap Talisman, Liu Yongqing was utterly annihilated, leaving no corpse behind. To avoid drawing attention, Yang Ji tossed all the severed limbs and remains into the lava pool. Liu Yongqing's storage bag was undamaged. Yang Ji had no time to inspect it, so he picked it up and then turned his gaze towards the Earth Spirit Fire. Now, he was in a bit of a predicament. His original intention was to use Liu Yongqing's presence to get it out, but that plan had now fallen through. After staring at it for a long while, unable to come up with any solutions, he set the matter aside for the moment.

He leaped, stepping on two currents of hot wind, and in the next instant, landed before the Flame Tree. These Flame Fruits were spiritual items capable of directly increasing cultivation. It would be a lie to say Yang Ji wasn't pleased. He immediately reached out and carefully plucked the five fiery orange, flame-like fruits. The spiritual fruits, upon touching his hand, weren't as scalding as he'd imagined; there was only a faint warmth. Yang Ji examined them for a moment, then put them away. After picking the Flame Fruits, he stared at the half-man-tall Flame Tree and fell into contemplation. A treasure tree capable of bearing spiritual fruits... if only it could be transplanted—

As this thought surfaced, information appeared on the Flame Tree before his eyes: [Flame Tree, grows on Fire Crystal, cannot survive without lava energy supply.]

Fire Crystal?

Yang Ji drew his sword and slashed. With a tearing sound, the sharp sword qi directly parted the lava around the base of the Flame Tree. He immediately caught sight of the fiery red, translucent crystal below in the foot-wide fissure. Immediately, information appeared: [Fire Crystal, condensed from the essence of lava, can absorb lava energy and give birth to Earth Spirit Fire.]

The Earth Spirit Fire is nurtured by Fire Crystal?

Yang Ji paused, and as he gazed, more information appeared: [Absorbing the Fire Essence within the Fire Crystal can form a nurturing 'mother embryo' for the Earth Spirit Fire, allowing the Earth Spirit Fire to be introduced into the body and slowly refined.]

The Earth Spirit Fire can be brought into the body!

Upon seeing this information, Yang Ji's body trembled with overwhelming surprise and delight. He had originally planned to use the Fiery Tiger Talismans to blast a path out while the Flame Snakes were distracted by Chen De and the others, escaping first and dealing with refining the Earth Spirit Fire later, when he was stronger. But he had never imagined that after absorbing the Fire Essence from the Fire Crystal, he could draw the Earth Spirit Fire into his body. This was a truly unexpected boon. Yang Ji glanced outside; the information showed that Chen De and the others were still fighting. He no longer hesitated. He wanted to quickly absorb the energy from the Fire Crystal and then rendezvous with them; otherwise, with only a few Fiery Tiger Talismans left, it would be difficult for him to break out alone.

With a fierce downward slash of his sword, a sharp clang echoed as the lava parted, and a Fire Crystal was abruptly cut free. Swinging his longsword, Yang Ji forcefully flicked it, sending the severed Fire Crystal onto the shore. One piece wasn't enough. He continued, repeating the process, cutting down a total of five Fire Crystals before stepping on air for a few paces and leaping back onto the shore. He now had Fire Crystals.

Yang Ji sat cross-legged on the reddish, hardened scorched earth, holding a Fire Crystal in his hands, and activated his cultivation technique to begin absorbing. This Fire Crystal was condensed from the essence of lava, and the Fire Essence within it was incredibly pure. As soon as his cultivation technique was activated, tendrils of red energy mist rose from the Fire Crystal, swiftly being drawn into Yang Ji's body. The head-sized Fire Crystal in his hands quickly diminished at a visible rate. In just about half an incense stick's time, all five Fire Crystals had been completely absorbed. Yang Ji glanced at the fist-sized cluster of Fire Essence within his body, resembling a red mist. Immediately, information appeared: [One thousand strands of Fire Essence.]

He wondered if these one thousand strands of Fire Essence would be enough to envelop the Earth Spirit Fire and draw it into his body. Yang Ji looked at the red cloud within his body, then at the Earth Spirit Fire in the center of the lava. With a mentality of trying it out, he leaped, took several steps in mid-air, and then hovered before the Earth Spirit Fire. He pointed at the Earth Spirit Fire with one hand, and the Fire Essence within his body surged out from his fingertip like red threads, quickly enveloping it like cotton floss. As Yang Ji formed hand seals, he intended to draw the Earth Spirit Fire into his body. But the Earth Spirit Fire remained completely motionless, showing no intention of following the refined Fire Essence and leaving. Yang Ji glanced at the information: [Insufficient Fire Essence. The nurturing embryo formed has insufficient attraction for the Earth Spirit Fire, far less than its original 'mother embryo'.]

Insufficient attraction? Looks like I need to add more 'betrothal gifts'.

Yang Ji immediately resumed, his sword rising and falling. In a short while, he had cut off more than half of the Fire Crystals in the lava pool. Just as he was about to retrieve more, he suddenly noticed that the temperature inside the cavern had risen sharply. He glanced at the Earth Spirit Fire, and his heart immediately tightened. He found that the Earth Spirit Fire had seemingly grown larger, its flames more vigorous, expanding from its original fist-size to head-size. [The reduction of Fire Crystals has damaged its original 'embryo', startling the Earth Spirit Fire, showing signs of rioting.]

Signs of rioting?

Oh no, please don't!

Yang Ji was startled. If the Earth Spirit Fire rioted and spread into a sea of flames, it would be difficult to deal with. He immediately retracted his raised flying sword and hastily returned to the shore to continue absorbing Fire Crystals.

A full incense stick's worth of time passed. All fifteen Fire Crystals were now completely absorbed. The red mist within his body, previously fist-sized, had now grown to the size of a head. Yang Ji didn't hesitate. He flew back before the Earth Spirit Fire, slowly extended the Fire Essence from within his body, enveloped it, and intended to move it.

Just then, the Earth Spirit Fire displayed: [Hesitation!], [Indecision!]

Hesitation?

I've cut off more than half of the Fire Crystals in this lava pool. The Fire Essence within my body is probably similar in quantity to the Fire Essence remaining in the lava pool's Fire Crystals. With both conditions being roughly equal, the Earth Spirit Fire was somewhat tempted but too lazy to move. It seems I still need to add more 'betrothal gifts'.

Yang Ji pondered for a moment and realized the key. Immediately, he slashed down with his sword again, obtaining another Fire Crystal. He held and refined with his left hand, while his right hand output the refined Fire Essence, using it to envelop the Earth Spirit Fire. After continuously refining two more pieces like this, the Fire Essence within Yang Ji's body was now clearly greater than the Fire Essence contained in the remaining Fire Crystals in the lava pool.

And just then, it moved. The Earth Spirit Fire finally moved. As Yang Ji gently shifted the Fire Essence, the Earth Spirit Fire enveloped within offered no resistance, slowly being pulled along a bit. Perhaps the Fire Essence enveloping it was abundant enough, making it feel as if it were in a mother's embrace, devoid of danger. The Earth Spirit Fire, which had almost rioted, slowly retracted its flames, returning to its fist-size once more. Seeing this, Yang Ji was overjoyed. He quickly and slowly maneuvered the Fire Essence, and thirty breaths later, he finally brought the Earth Spirit Fire into his body.

Within his Dantian, the Fire Essence, under Yang Ji's control, had transformed into the shape of a bird's nest. And the Earth Spirit Fire, like a newly hatched chick, comfortably nestled within, glowing, radiating heat, and crackling with flames.
