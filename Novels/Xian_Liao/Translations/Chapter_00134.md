# Chapter 134: Reactions from All Sides

The news of Zhou Qing's exploits amidst the beast tide spread rapidly through various channels. Meanwhile, Zhou Qing and his companion Mao Ri, after their grand display, were recuperating deep within the desolate Lingling Ridge, inside the sealed cave abode of the aged Qingmo.

A strand of Qingyang spiritual fire illuminated the cave buried deep within the mountain. Taking advantage of the lull in the beast tide, Zhou Qing and Mao Ri hastened to restore their condition. Despite his formidable cultivation and physical prowess, the immense exertion had left him more drained than he appeared.

Yet, this grand display had yielded bountiful rewards. For Zhou Qing, whose strength had reached its current level, and with Lingling Ridge's market attracting the attention of Tianxuan City, this was an opportune moment to deepen ties with Tianxuan City under the guise of Qinglingzi during the beast tide.

Through his Insightful Eyes of Truth, Zhou Qing discerned that the aura Tianxuan Patriarch projected indicated he had only twenty to thirty years of life remaining. Should the patriarch pass away, Tianxuan City would inevitably fall, leaving no stable environment for large-scale resource gathering. Moreover, without the city's deterrence against the demonic beasts, the relatively peaceful Lingling Ridge would face unimaginable pressure, forcing Zhou Qing to operate in the shadows.

With his ability to assume different identities using the Thousand Illusions technique, Zhou Qing could switch roles at will. Thus, by showcasing his prowess now and aiding Tianxuan City in withstanding the beast tide, he could secure further support from the city.

Tianxuan City not only possessed resources but also housed numerous ancient texts and cultivation techniques accumulated by humanity—knowledge beyond the reach of figures like Immortal Luo. However, Zhou Qing's formidable performance during the beast tide undoubtedly qualified him to access these accumulated insights and resources.

Tianxuan City had survived solely due to the patriarch's presence, yet the beast tide had long hindered its growth. If Zhou Qing could obtain those ancient texts and cultivation resources, the safety of the mortal realm would allow the Dao Court to leap forward in strength.

Given Tianxuan Patriarch's vision, the better Zhou Qing performed during the beast tide, the more recognition he would receive. If the patriarch ultimately failed to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, Zhou Qing could simply abandon the Qinglingzi identity. Still, this period would suffice for him to reap substantial benefits from Tianxuan City.

Failing to seize this opportunity to acquire Tianxuan City's resources would mean missing out once the patriarch's breakthrough attempt ended in failure. Of course, Zhou Qing still hoped the patriarch could withstand the pressure and succeed in his advancement, though he deemed the chances slim. Moreover, when the patriarch attempted his breakthrough, the demonic beasts would undoubtedly spare no effort to stop him.

Zhou Qing had also considered another possibility: if Tianxuan Patriarch concluded that reaching the Nascent Soul stage was hopeless, he might set a deadly trap to lure high-level demonic beasts and take as many down with him as possible. This would buy time and space, leaving behind a final spark of hope for humanity. In that case, they could only trust in the wisdom of future generations.

By then, the patriarch would select promising talents to carry humanity's hope. A standout like Zhou Qing, a righteous cultivator rather than a demonic one, would undoubtedly receive special attention. Thus, Zhou Qing's actions during the beast tide were also a dialogue between him—a guardian of humanity's future—and Tianxuan Patriarch, the protector of its past.

Zhou Qing calmed his mind, banishing distracting thoughts as his breaths resonated like thunder.

In Tianxuan City, the Hidden Dragon Rankings listed the names of various cultivators, including those from the four great demonic sects. The rankings were based on a cultivator's potential to reach the Golden Core stage. Currently, Qinglingzi (Zhou Qing) occupied the undisputed top spot.

During the beast tide's respite, massive projections from recording stones in the city displayed scenes of Zhou Qing's battles. His invincible dominance amidst the beast tide was awe-inspiring, clearly demonstrating that he stood a tier above ordinary perfected Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"If my strongest strike could match Qinglingzi's feats, I still couldn't sustain such performance," mused Crane Immortal, realizing the comprehensive gap between them. Golden Light, watching the projections, also felt a tremor in his heart. Though he had pushed himself to the limits beneath the Golden Core stage, Zhou Qing had surpassed even that.

"His performance shows his mastery of essence, energy, and spirit surpasses mine. Forming a Golden Core would be far easier for him than for me," Golden Light admitted. "Humanity is fortunate to have such a talent, though it's a pity he emerged so late."

Despite his envy and jealousy, Golden Light couldn't help but lament. Had Zhou Qing appeared a century earlier, things might have been different. No matter how dazzling Zhou Qing's display, he remained a Foundation Establishment cultivator, not yet a Golden Core. Even if he formed his core in twenty or thirty years, protecting humanity would require at least mid-Golden Core strength, if not the patriarch's level, to secure Tianxuan City—humanity's last bastion.

By the blood pool of the Blood Demon Sect, Qin Qing felt somewhat embarrassed. She had thought to assist Zhou Qing, only to find he needed no help from her. Such a prodigy would likely disdain a demonic cultivator like her.

The demonic path revered strength, so she bore no resentment toward Zhou Qing, only a sense of defeat. After viewing the recordings, the Blood Demon Sect's leader remained silent for a moment before saying, "Qing'er, with such a genius emerging, it seems the fortunes of humanity in the Jingyang Dao Domain are not yet exhausted."

On the second day of the beast tide, before the red sun could rise, rolling demonic clouds blotted out the dawn. Eerie cries echoed through the mist as it spread across Lingling Ridge, accompanied by chilling wolf howls.

Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song swiftly arrived at the mountain gate. At that moment, talismans shot skyward, transforming into blazing flames—the Binghuo Divine Thunder. The explosions of fire and thunder shattered the demonic clouds and dispersed the mist, while Solar True Fire bloomed amidst the chaos.

The obscured night sky reappeared as the red sun emerged on the horizon, its glow intertwining with Mao Ri's Solar True Fire. For a moment, twin suns hung in the sky!

A surge of demonic energy rushed forward, only to be cleaved apart by the Qinghuang Sword. However, the sword light was deflected by a pale-white blade, swiftly returning to its wielder.

A white-robed youth appeared amidst the clouds, flanked by countless demonic beasts organized into a disciplined army, with spectral entities flickering among them. The youth's features were strikingly handsome yet eerie, his only anomaly being a pair of wolf ears. His white robe, crafted from a mesmerizing wolf pelt, exuded an intimidating aura. There was an undeniable nobility about him.

"The White Moon Wolf Clan's young master—Greed Wolf!" exclaimed distant cultivators.

Greed Wolf, the White Moon Wolf Clan's saint, had been born with his bones refined and meridians cleansed by the clan's patriarch, allowing him to assume human form despite not yet forming a Golden Core. He was the most formidable demonic beast beneath the Golden Core stage. That Qinglingzi had drawn the attention of such a prodigious demonic saint spoke volumes.

From the demonic beasts' perspective, such a human prodigy had to be eradicated. Bound by the agreement preventing Golden Core beings from intervening, they could only dispatch the White Moon Wolf Clan's saint. Moreover, Qinglingzi's elimination of the Black Tiger of Profound Yang had pleased the White Moon Wolves, further motivating them to confront him.

In the void, Zhou Qing and Greed Wolf faced off. Zhou Qing's immense spiritual sense surged like a storm, pressing down on the wolf saint. Spiritual sense was a demonic beast's weakness, and Zhou Qing seized the initiative.

Greed Wolf had not anticipated Zhou Qing's spiritual prowess. Though demonic beasts' souls were naturally inferior to humans', as the White Moon Wolf Clan's saint, he had been tempered with countless rare treasures, granting him spiritual sense comparable to a perfected Foundation Establishment human. Yet Zhou Qing's spiritual sense still overpowered him effortlessly.

Greed Wolf slashed the air with his pale-white blade—the Life-Severing Saber, forged from a fang of the White Moon Wolf ancestor. The blade possessed extraordinary power and unique abilities. Zhou Qing had already withdrawn his spiritual sense before the slash landed, but the ensuing blade energy, targeting essence and spirit, was shattered by a single punch from Zhou Qing.

His display of physical might left Greed Wolf inwardly shaken. "The reports were true—this human's physique rivals ours." As the White Moon Wolf saint, however, fear was not in his nature. His resolve to kill only hardened.

Having fought the previous day, Zhou Qing now had a clearer grasp of his own strength. Having forged his Dao Furnace, even without completing the Lung Metal Thunder and Spleen Earth Thunder, his Jade Marrow Reverted Elixir had elevated his mana and physique to the pinnacle of Foundation Establishment and Body Forging. His mana was exceptionally pure, and his endurance unmatched among peers.

Only by mastering all Five Organ Thunders and achieving the Primordial Unity Divine Light would his Dao Furnace reach true perfection at the Foundation Establishment level. Then, he might stand a chance against an early Golden Core cultivator. For now, he stood above perfected Foundation Establishment but below Golden Core—a vast gap separating the two realms.

Greed Wolf, bolstered by his clan's resources, had indeed transcended the demonic beasts' innate spiritual limitations, matching a typical human perfected Foundation Establishment cultivator. Yet Zhou Qing's spiritual sense far surpassed even Golden Light and Crane Immortal's. His greatest talent lay in his soul.

With his Insightful Eyes of Truth open, Zhou Qing shattered the blade energy with a punch while the Qinghuang Sword erupted with thunderous fury, streaking toward Greed Wolf's eyes like lightning—Moon Pierce!

Brilliant light coalesced into a pure white moon before Greed Wolf's eyes. As a wolf, he was acutely sensitive to the moon, and the vision momentarily dazed him. Zhou Qing's sword struck like thunder at the wolf saint's brow—yet no joy crossed Zhou Qing's face as Greed Wolf's form dissolved like rippling water.

"White Moon Wolf Clan's innate ability—'Wolf Shadow.'" Similar to a human's teleportation technique, this ability allowed the user to momentarily phase into a shadow at critical moments. However, it could only be used once in a short period.

Greed Wolf shuddered inwardly. This human was terrifying, exploiting his clan's weakness so adeptly that he had nearly suffered severe injuries. Over the years, Zhou Qing had studied demonic beast lore extensively. How could he not know of the White Moon Wolves' Wolf Shadow? Hence, he had forced the ability out early to prevent its use at a crucial moment.

His mind was as still as the moon reflected in a well, undisturbed by external chaos. Through his Insightful Eyes, Greed Wolf's position was laid bare. The Qinghuang Sword's radiance surged like rolling tides, thundering toward the wolf saint's new location.

Greed Wolf's heart raced. Gripping the Life-Severing Saber, he summoned a massive blade energy in an instant, slashing down fiercely at the Qinghuang Sword. Blade and tide collided.

The wolf saint tirelessly parried Zhou Qing's swordplay. Their exchange showcased flawless techniques. Soon, Greed Wolf's body erupted with swirling energy, ethereal forms materializing as eerie light pulsed around him, exuding an oppressive, frigid aura. The Qinghuang Sword's tidal force gradually waned.

Yet Zhou Qing grew calmer, his resolve unshaken. No matter what, he would not yield—even if it meant incurring Tianxuan Patriarch's displeasure.

"Zijian, it seems Qinglingzi exceeds my expectations. I had intended to meet him after his Golden Core formation, but I've changed my mind. After the beast tide, arrange for him to see me," Tianxuan Patriarch said, his tone a mix of satisfaction and regret.

"As you command," Shang Zijian acknowledged before departing to prepare for the next wave of the beast tide.

On the beast tide's second day, before dawn, demonic clouds once again blotted out the sky. The White Moon Wolf saint had come, heralding a battle that would echo across the land.
