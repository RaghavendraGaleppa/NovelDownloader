# Chapter 95: The Hotpot Restaurant Opens (Part 1)

In a secret room at the back of the government office's main hall, it was much quieter compared to the clamor outside.

Before a table sat a young man in a white robe with a gloomy expression, drinking alone.

If he were to walk outside, he would certainly be recognized.

It was Yin Huacheng.

Not long after, the door to the secret room rumbled open. Prefect Cui circulated his Qi slightly, and the alcohol fumes on his body evaporated clean. The drunkenness in his eyes seemed to be sucked into a vortex, vanishing without a trace.

In an instant, his intoxicated appearance returned to one of shrewdness.

"I've kept you waiting, Yin Hua True Disciple. I was truly burdened with official duties; I deserve to be punished."

Prefect Cui sat down opposite Yin Huacheng with a smile, pouring him a cup of tea.

Yin Huacheng narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing the teacup. After draining it in one gulp, he sneered, "With just the two of us here in private, why bother putting on a show? Or have you been Prefect for so long that you've started to believe it yourself?"

"Judge Cui?"

The smile on Prefect Cui's face gradually disappeared. He poured himself a cup of tea before saying, "Li Mo and Ying Bing did not show up today. You waited for nothing, Yin Hua Envoy."

"They didn't come?"

Yin Huacheng tapped the table with his index finger. "No matter. As long as they are found, just inform me immediately."

"I came this time for another matter. The goods I ordered from the Demonic Cult—you've been causing delays with wind and rain. By my calculations, they should have arrived by now, shouldn't they?"

"There must be an explanation for this. You wouldn't be using some small fry to take the blame, claiming they failed to execute the task, would you?"

As he spoke, Yin Huacheng's tone carried a hint of accusation.

"The situation is tense right now. If my business with you were to leak even half a word, my position as Prefect would be over. The Main Tower would hold me accountable; I have no choice but to be cautious."

Prefect Cui seemed somewhat weary, squinting as he spoke.

Yin Huacheng's expression shifted unpredictably.

The business they spoke of was not the cooperation between the Drizzle Pavilion and the Demonic Cult. It was a private transaction between Prefect Cui and his father.

But Yin Huacheng pressed on, "Didn't you already keep the people from the major and minor sects within the government office? They are all under your watchful eye. What is there to fear?"

"They are under my watch, but haven't I also been under theirs?"

Prefect Cui set his teacop down on the table with a clatter, a fake smile on his face. "I will send someone to figure out a way to handle the business and will give you a result. I informed your father of this matter in advance."

"It had better be so."

Yin Huacheng also let out a cold snort. "If you delay the Cult's major affairs, the person coming to talk to you won't be me anymore."

With that, he suddenly stood up and left.

Prefect Cui watched his figure disappear and let out a contemptuous laugh.

"How did Yin Huaxuan manage to father such a fool?"

He said no more, toying with the teacup in his hand.

Time passed. Who knows how long it was before the door to the secret room was suddenly knocked upon.

"Who?"

A voice condensed into a thin thread and passed through the door, audible to no one but Prefect Cui.

"It's me," the voice came again.

"Come in."

A shadow suddenly slithered in along the ground. The shadow writhed a few times before solidifying into a human form.

This person wore a loose monk's robe and a smiling Buddha mask on his face.

The voice from under the Buddha mask was indistinguishable as male or female.

"Judge, the 'Hallfront Swallows' have all been distributed."

"I have a personal matter to entrust to you."

"If it is a private matter, why not post a bounty in the Dark Pavilion?"

The man with the Buddha mask responded.

The Drizzle Pavilion valued money over people. Aside from the Main Tower Master, there was no superior-subordinate relationship between others. Even a Heaven-Slayer level assassin could not command a non-ranked assassin.

"Even if I posted a bounty, within the Prefecture City, besides you, Smiling Maitreya, who else could this old man trust?"

"Let's just skip the formalities, don't you agree?"

Prefect Cui took a bag from his robe.

Smiling Maitreya raised his hand and summoned the bag into his palm. After a slight sensing of it, he put it away, seemingly satisfied with the reward.

"Please, go on."

***

"The Prefecture City is getting increasingly chaotic. When the time comes, I want you to muddy the waters and snatch some orphans without parents or kin, and send them to my private residence."

"A small matter."

Smiling Maitreya agreed.

The transaction was made, and the two began to chat idly.

"Regarding this trial, do you have anyone you fancy?"

"The Three Scourges of Huai Mountain: He Bin the Flying Sand Blade, Chu He the Thousand Net Hands, and Liu Heng the Night Ghost. They all have a chance of surviving to the end."

"The Three Scourges of Huai Mountain you mentioned died this afternoon. It seems they were no match for Zuoqiu Yang."

Prefect Cui, seeing that the other did not believe him, took a name list from his robe. It was a special list issued by the Main Tower that could sense the Qi within the Hallfront Swallows.

"See for yourself."

"......"

Smiling Maitreya glanced at it, then looked up again. The smiling Buddha face seemed to say, 'Do you think I'm blind?'

Prefect Cui raised an eyebrow and lowered his head to look.

He found that the names of the Three Scourges of Huai Mountain were still clearly on the list.

He had clearly seen their names dissipate earlier.

Could there be a problem with the Hallfront Swallows?

If it were just one, that would be one thing, but all three at once?

As a formidable expert of the Divine Observation Realm, could he really have been mistaken?

***

In the驿馆 (Post House).

The Post House had been cleaned spotlessly.

[You have a reward waiting to be claimed.]
[Claim Successful]
[Investment Feedback: Ruyi Art]
[Ruyi Art]: "Can alter one's form, change one's appearance, and even change one's Qi. Even an expert of the Divine Observation Realm would absolutely be unable to see through it."

"I have the Phantasmal Silken Gauze, so I don't need to worry about that."

Li Mo raised his eyes and looked at the others.

Those who dared to participate in the Infinite Trial were mostly old hands in the Jianghu. If they didn't conceal themselves, they would be easily seen through.

"I have a martial art here that can change one's appearance and Qi. Even an expert of the Divine Observation Realm won't be able to see through it."

Li Mo took a sheepskin scroll from his robe.

"Ruyi Art?"

Xiao Qin looked at this miraculous martial art. The Thousand Form Martial Sovereign had told him it was a rare and valuable item.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and took it into her hand.

She only looked at it for a moment before the Qi from her body gradually disappeared.

Li Mo had originally wondered if this counted as an investment.

Unfortunately, since it wasn't something they needed, the system did not send a prompt.

Thus, the Post House gained a new waiter, a new chef, a new boss, and a new boss's wife.

As for why a chef was needed...

Because Li Mo had provided Xiao Qin with a hotpot base recipe.

This was his thinking: The better the business, the more people would come. The prospective assassins participating in the trial would definitely come to places with high foot traffic to gather information.

And so, the Post House was transformed into a hotpot restaurant.

***

A few days later.

"Eh? Wasn't this place a Post House before?"

A team of caravan guards stopped their carriage and horses outside the Post House—or rather, the hotpot restaurant.

"The situation is tense recently. We should enter the city first before making any other plans."

"Exactly because of that, we should gather some information before entering the city."

"That makes sense."

"So... are you sure it's not just because the smell from inside is too enticing?"

The caravan leader stared at the name of the hotpot restaurant: [Joyful Sheep.]

After a moment, he nodded.

"We'll stay here for the night."

The caravan guards walked into the shop, and a wave of boisterous clamor washed over them.

Was this newly opened hotpot restaurant really this popular?
