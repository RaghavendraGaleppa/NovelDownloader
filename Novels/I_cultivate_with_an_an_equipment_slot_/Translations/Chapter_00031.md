# Chapter 31: Come Here, You!

"Water Origin Technique, the most basic water-element spell...  
Foundation Establishment method...  
The foundation of water-element spells..."  

A massive influx of knowledge poured into Zhang Yan's mind, leaving him dizzy. The sheer volume of information was overwhelming.  

Through this knowledge transfer, Zhang Yan also learned some well-kept secrets.  

In a way, the woman who sold him the fragment had been right—this Water Origin Manual truly dated back to ancient times. It recorded a method for Foundation Establishment.  

Foundation Establishment methods were always closely guarded secrets of sects and families. The simplest method was using a Foundation Establishment Pill, but this only granted the realm without any additional benefits.  

Beyond that, there were various other methods: Foundation Establishment through a Lifebound Magical Artifact, Lifebound Talisman, Lifebound Spirit Pill, or even Lifebound Formation.  

And then...  

The most conventional yet most difficult method—Foundation Establishment through Lifebound Spells.  

The Water Origin Manual documented this very method. According to its records, mastering the Water Origin Technique to perfection allowed one to comprehend the essence of water during Foundation Establishment, transforming it into the divine ability Water Spirit Technique.  

The Water Spirit Technique allowed manipulation of water-element spiritual power. At first glance, it didn’t seem particularly special.  

But...  

According to the manual, the Water Spirit Technique could simulate other water-element divine abilities.  

"If the Water Origin Technique can simulate water-element divine abilities... what about the Wood Origin Technique? Could it simulate wood-element divine abilities? And the Metal Origin Technique? What if I mastered all the Origin Techniques—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—to perfection?"  

Origin Techniques belonged to a broad category of spells, with nearly every element having its corresponding version. Their primary function was to extract the purest spiritual energy, but they lacked offensive capabilities. Currently, the Wood Origin Technique was the most popular, as it could accelerate plant growth and even heal, making it somewhat useful.  

The other Origin Techniques, however, were nearly useless—barely more than the most basic spells, practiced by novices but rarely mastered to perfection.  

"Strange. Even if other Origin Techniques are disregarded, why hasn’t anyone perfected the Wood Origin Technique? Has no one ever used it as a Foundation Establishment spell?"  

"Or perhaps those who used it didn’t gain the Wood Spirit Technique? Or maybe they simply never spoke of it?" Zhang Yan’s eyes flickered with suspicion. It wasn’t impossible.  

Origin Techniques represented the most fundamental manipulation of spiritual energy. The idea that Spirit Techniques could simulate spells of the same element sounded terrifying.  

But if it were truly that powerful, shouldn’t it have been widely known by now? Yet he had never heard of such a thing.  

Zhang Yan wasn’t entirely convinced by the claims in the Water Origin Manual.  

"The sect might have records. I’ll check later."  

Though he had doubts, the fact that the Water Origin Technique could be mastered to perfection was undeniable.  

Besides, what did it matter if it was true or not?  

He could just learn them all!  

For others, unreliable information might lead to wasted years of cultivation—imagine striving to become a battle cultivator, only to reach Foundation Establishment and find no offensive power!  

But Zhang Yan was different!  

He had the Equipment Panel!  

He had cheats!  

He could have it all!  

First, master all the Origin Techniques to perfection. Then, learn some offensive spells on the side.  

With cheats, he could afford to be this reckless!  

Having made up his mind, Zhang Yan stopped overthinking.  

In his courtyard, he took out another item—a cracked alchemy furnace.  

The Wood Origin Alchemy Furnace.  

He had acquired it long ago but never used it, partly due to lack of funds and partly because he hadn’t fully grasped the "Minor Mastery of Alchemy" skill.  

Only by equipping the Wood Origin Alchemy Furnace could he achieve Minor Mastery in alchemy. But once equipped, he couldn’t use it for actual refining.  

Now, after so long, he had finally deciphered the "Minor Mastery of Alchemy" inscribed on the furnace—though it was limited to Qi Gathering Pills.  

Still, it was enough for now.  

During his time in the market, he had also bought some spirit herbs, which he could now use for alchemy.  

"With Minor Mastery, the success rate for Qi Gathering Pills is about thirty percent. If I can refine three pills per batch, I’ll break even!"  

After some thought, he took out a set of array flags and scattered them around the courtyard.  

This was the simplest type of array—no illusions, no offensive capabilities, only the power to block prying eyes.  

It had been a gift from the sect, but he had never used it before, disliking the need to expend spirit stones.  

Now that he was about to refine pills, however, he couldn’t afford to be stingy.  

Activating the array, he took out his materials—and most importantly, the spirit charcoal.  

Since he lacked a fire-element spiritual root and hadn’t learned any fire spells, he had to rely on spirit charcoal for alchemy.  

This was fine for Qi Gathering Pills, but refining higher-grade pills would require specialized fire spells or even earthfire.  

Lighting the spirit charcoal, he soon had the Wood Origin Alchemy Furnace glowing red-hot.  

Then, Zhang Yan began refining.  

Though it was his first attempt, every movement was executed as if he had done it a thousand times before.  

His control over the flame was especially impeccable—a benefit of the "Major Mastery of Flame Control" inscribed on the furnace.  

Flame control was the hardest part of alchemy, and with Zhang Yan’s mastery, combined with his Minor Mastery of Alchemy, success was almost guaranteed.  

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.  

Zhang Yan hadn’t slept the entire time, keeping a close watch on the furnace.  

"Success or failure hinges on this moment."  

With a final incantation, the furnace lid burst open, releasing a rich, medicinal fragrance.  

"This scent…!"  

Zhang Yan hurriedly peered inside.  

"Four Qi Gathering Pills!"  

He was ecstatic. He had expected three at most, but four was beyond his wildest hopes—this was an overperformance!  

Delighted, he retrieved a prepared jade vial and carefully stored the pills to preserve their potency.  

"Not bad, not bad. From now on, I can pass as a half-decent alchemist!"  

Packing away the furnace, he eagerly took out one of the pills, ready to test it.  

But after hesitating for a long time, he couldn’t bring himself to swallow it.  

"Even though the Equipment Panel lists it as a Qi Gathering Pill, and the ingredients were correct… why am I so afraid to take my own product?"  

Just then, he noticed a bird preening its feathers atop the courtyard wall.  

A grin spread across his face.  

"Come here, you!"
