# Chapter 54: The Sixth Layer of the Lingdong Stage

The beauty of this method was that by injecting spiritual power into the orb, Lin Xuan could control how much of his cultivation level to conceal. The more power he channeled into the orb, the less remained in his meridians and dantian, making his apparent cultivation level lower—and vice versa.

After testing it, Lin Xuan found he could inject up to ninety percent of his spiritual power into the orb. This would make any observer mistake him for a first-layer Lingdong Stage cultivator. No matter how hard he tried, however, he couldn't conceal all his spiritual power completely. But he wasn't greedy—this result already satisfied him greatly.

Lying on his bed, Lin Xuan began contemplating the benefits of the green liquid refined from the Scarlet Vine Grass. First and foremost, it allowed him to hide his cultivation level from fellow disciples, eliminating any worries about accidental exposure and its potentially severe consequences.

Secondly, it would be immensely helpful in combat. By concealing his true strength within the orb—without hindering his ability to cast spells—he could lure opponents into underestimating him. If they mistook him for a mere first-layer cultivator, they might even forgo activating their spiritual shields. Then, he could strike unexpectedly with a powerful technique, catching them off guard.

Of course, there were still questions to answer. The green liquid's effects were surely time-limited—how long would the orb last before dissipating? He could experiment with that later.

Beyond the Scarlet Vine Grass, this successful refinement held even greater significance. It proved the blue light dots weren't just effective for pills—they could purify plants and medicinal herbs as well. This revelation excited Lin Xuan the most.

With so many advantages, his confidence in immortal cultivation grew stronger!

After resting until his Star Sea returned to normal, Lin Xuan resumed the purification process. Once he mastered the technique, refining Scarlet Vine Grass turned out to be easier than purifying pills.

He spent the entire night refining all the herbs in the bamboo basket, ending up with three full bottles of the green liquid. Since only a tiny sip was needed to form the spiritual power-concealing orb, these bottles would last him a long time.

Free from worries, Lin Xuan devoted himself even more diligently to cultivation. Reaching the late Lingdong Stage wasn't enough—he had only just mastered the fifth layer. Now, he aimed for higher realms.

This wasn't impatience. His recent journey had taught him that strength was the ultimate truth in this world. He was still too weak and needed to push himself harder.

Take the Spirit Control Technique, for example. When he finally obtained the mid-tier technique from the Lingyun Sect, he realized it wasn't as simple as he'd assumed.

---

To learn the Spirit Control Technique, one needed at least sixth-layer Lingdong Stage cultivation!

This was because wielding spiritual tools with this technique consumed spiritual power rapidly. Without sufficient cultivation, one simply couldn't sustain it—making the sixth layer the bare minimum.

Lin Xuan wasn't discouraged. Strengthening his foundation first would allow him to wield spiritual tools more powerfully.

Over the next half-month, he focused on purifying pills. Since entering the late Lingdong Stage, the blue light had expanded, increasing his purification success rate. Though he spent the same amount of time as before, he obtained far more pills—especially the mid-tier Marrow Cleansing Pills, of which he now had over sixty. Planning a month-long seclusion, he could consume two to three pills daily.

A month later, Lin Xuan emerged from seclusion, his expression unreadable. Without a word, he headed straight for the discarded pill storage, gathered another batch, and returned to his quarters, shutting himself in and refusing all visitors.

...

Another month passed before he emerged again—only to resume seclusion after less than a day's rest.

The servant boys like Zhao Ming were astounded, their admiration for Lin Xuan reaching new heights. After all, who else could spend months lazily sleeping indoors without growing bored? Only this immortal master before them.

Their lack of suspicion was thanks to Lin Xuan's cunning—his carefully cultivated image of laziness had thoroughly deceived everyone around him.

Finally, after three full months, Lin Xuan officially ended his closed-door cultivation.

His efforts bore fruit. With countless spirit pills and relentless dedication, he successfully mastered the sixth layer of his technique.

Looking back on those three months, even Lin Xuan—with his extraordinary willpower—felt a lingering dread. He had barely rested, sleeping less than two hours daily. The rest of his time was spent in meditation and qi cultivation.

The Great Heavenly Cycle of the Lingyun Art was exhausting. At first, completing even one cycle left him utterly drained. Yet even when he could barely move a finger, he forced himself to persist. Now, he could perform nine cycles a day.

His rapid progress wasn't solely due to the pills—Lin Xuan's own perseverance played an equally vital role.

Unlike his previous emergence after breaking through the fifth layer—when his spiritual power faintly radiated, marking his advanced cultivation—Lin Xuan now appeared utterly unremarkable, even listless.

This wasn't from exhaustion. Though the months had been grueling, he had rested properly before ending seclusion, restoring both his stamina and spiritual power to peak condition.

His languid demeanor was entirely feigned. Combined with the Scarlet Vine Grass's green liquid, his cultivation was completely concealed. Not just ordinary elders and disciples—Lin Xuan was confident that even facing Sect Leader Yunhe Zhenren, a Core Formation expert, the man would be fooled into thinking he was merely a first-layer Lingdong cultivator.

"Immortal Master!" Seeing Lin Xuan finally emerge, Zhao Ming and the other servants hurriedly bowed.

"Mm. Attend to your duties. Don't mind me."

Lin Xuan left the courtyard, heading outward. Though he could now learn the Spirit Control Technique, after such prolonged seclusion, he wanted to stretch his legs. While dedicated to cultivation, he understood the importance of balancing work and rest. There was no rushing perfection—a few days of relaxation wouldn't hurt.
