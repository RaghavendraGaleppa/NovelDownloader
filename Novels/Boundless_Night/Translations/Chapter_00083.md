**Chapter 83: Timely Assistance in the Snow**

Qin Ming’s body moved like swift lightning, his speed fierce and rapid. His feet stomped the forest floor, stirring up a gale as he arrived, swinging the heavy dark gold hammer, which unleashed a terrifying sonic boom. The forest seemed to explode, and all the branches caught in his path shattered instantly.

Ge Qianxun’s pupils constricted. He had no way to avoid, gripping a pair of very heavy iron whips, clashing with all his might against the youth before him. In an instant, sparks flew within the mountain forest, and many large trees toppled. Their first clash left the ground littered with broken branches—it was a pure contest of strength.

Ge Qianxun staggered backward, his hands gripping the iron whips trembling slightly. The opponent’s great hammer strike churned his blood and qi, leaving him feeling suffocated. Although he had acquired and studied the Sun family’s hammer techniques, he did not use hammer-type weapons. He showed a surprised expression; how old was this youth? It was truly outrageous. He was a seasoned expert of seven Rebirths, and his hidden identity was that of the Golden Thief.

Ge Qianxun found that his opponent remained composed, effortlessly swinging such a high-speed and terrifying hammer. Qin Ming launched another attack against him, seemingly without breaking a sweat. Qin Ming was indeed very calm; with nearly five thousand jin of strength, the dark gold hammer, which seemed incredibly heavy to others, was actually very light to him.

With a thunderous boom, as if lightning had struck the mountain forest, Qin Ming swung the dark gold hammer. Wherever it passed, it carved out white shockwaves, and trees crumbled. This time, although Ge Qianxun crossed his dual whips to block, he was nevertheless sent flying, crashing through many trees with incessant cracking sounds. His entire face flushed, a result of his internal blood surging. Though the dark gold hammer hadn't directly struck his body, the impact had left him severely shaken. His arms felt numb, forcing him to shake them slightly to restore circulation.

Dai Shifeng and his confidants all shivered with fright. How powerful was that youth? Just two hammer strikes, and he sent the former hall master flying.

“I knew this ‘job’ would be quite tricky,” Ge Qianxun said with a grim expression. “I didn’t expect it to be about your strength, not your unknown identity. The most hateful thing is that the employer only paid a small sum of Daylight Gold in advance!”

“Seven Rebirths are nothing more than this,” Qin Ming stepped forward. “Ge Qianxun, repay the blood debt for the Sun family!”

Behind them, Dai Shifeng, a Sixth Rebirth expert, sighed, while his subordinates' expressions were a mix of emotions.

Ge Qianxun’s ferocity ignited. “This old man has cultivated himself for many years. It seems if I don’t unleash all my power, you’ll all think Old Ge is soft and easily bullied.” His body actually swelled up, rapidly expanding by a full circle, muscles bulging. He had clearly practiced some kind of hardened body art, and his physique instantly became robust and powerful. Even the wrinkles on his face were smoothed out by the bulging flesh, making him look ten years younger.

“I recall back then, when I first underwent Rebirth, I was also a genius who could lift cauldrons weighing over six hundred jin. If not for someone breaking my hardened body art and damaging my foundation, I would have long since unleashed Heavenly Radiance externally, belonging to another grand realm.” He carried an intense resentment. After his foundation was ruined, he took over twenty spiritual substances and even consumed forbidden drugs to achieve what he had today, but he was completely severed from the next grand realm.

Ge Qianxun’s tone was icy. “Don’t be arrogant in front of this old man, you so-called genius, you might just be killed!” He pounced forward, his dual whips like rainbows, piercing the gloom of the dense forest with thunderous sounds.

However, the greater the force he used, the more severe the backlash he suffered when his attack was blocked by the iron hammer, making him feel like his fingers were about to shatter. One of his iron whips flew out of his hand, and the other was bent out of shape.

“Only this much strength? Barely over four thousand jin after seven transformations. I thought after all that talk, you’d at least have over four thousand five hundred jin.” Qin Ming said lightly, then swung the great hammer again. “Let me show you the true essence of the Sun family’s hammer techniques!”

The so-called hammer techniques also contained whip force. Qin Ming’s arm swung like a whip, maximizing his strength. As for the hammer force, it was needless to say—like shaking a mountain! Qin Ming was swift as a phantom, his long-handled dark gold hammer unleashing genuine wind and thunder sounds. Any nearby branches were instantly blown apart.

With a crash, Ge Qianxun was sent flying again, his bent iron whip flying out of his hand. Heavenly Radiance circulated on his right hand. He was sure that if he had confronted it with pure physical body without Heavenly Radiance protection, his entire arm would have been crippled. How many times had this youth undergone Rebirth? His strength alone was enough to crush him.

“At my level, weapons are no longer important, rather they are a hindrance,” Ge Qianxun roared. “Let me show you the Heavenly Radiance Force of a Golden Thief, I’ll cleave you apart!” He then shot into the forest with a ‘whoosh,’ seemingly trying to escape.

“Same trick again, it’s useless!” Qin Ming said coldly, sweeping across his path with a ‘whoosh.’ Although he was only at the Fourth Rebirth stage, his physical attributes, be it strength or speed, had increased far more rapidly than his opponent’s.

This time, Ge Qianxun was not trying to escape; he was looking for advantageous terrain. His face grim, he circulated his Heavenly Radiance Force, cultivated for decades, immensely powerful, and struck forward. Wherever his palm and fingers passed, the tangled branches blocking his way instantly turned to dust.

Qin Ming successively blocked it with his great hammer, then lowered his head to look. Two faint palm prints had actually appeared on it. “Good, let me show you the power of Heavenly Radiance Force within the Sun family’s hammer techniques!” Qin Ming no longer swung his hammer, but instead pressed forward with a single hand as fast as lightning. He activated the Sun family’s whip force, hammer force, and the mysterious composite ‘Explosive Force’ obtained from the Thunder-Fire Alchemist Temple, which was the precursor to Thunder Force. The three forces merged and blasted out.

Ge Qianxun sneered. His body was incredibly tough after his fifth Rebirth, and after his sixth Rebirth, he gained a special ability to temporarily boost his Heavenly Radiance Force significantly. Unfortunately, his seventh Rebirth was propelled by forbidden drugs, making it somewhat hollow.

For a moment, the Heavenly Radiance emanating from Ge Qianxun’s hands was dazzling. Qin Ming’s single hand clashed with his two hands consecutively. Two thunderous sounds erupted in the forest, accompanied by dazzling Heavenly Radiance. A strong wind swept through the area; many dead branches were picked up from the ground, then shattered in mid-air.

Ge Qianxun simply couldn't believe it. His hands were bloody and mangled, bleeding non-stop; he couldn't block the opponent's Heavenly Radiance Force at all. He remained silent, becoming even more dangerous. Ge Qianxun prepared to fight to the death, knowing that if he couldn't block any longer, he would truly perish here. His bones crackled non-stop. This time, his body didn’t swell but instead shrank. Only his right hand seemed to enlarge. After the bleeding stopped, it began to emit dazzling light. He was mobilizing all his essence, qi, and spirit, fusing several types of Heavenly Radiance Force, concentrating them all in his right hand to unleash his strongest strike, blasting it towards Qin Ming.

Qin Ming had not yet tried the effect of his integrated Heavenly Radiance Force on a living person. Now he wanted to test a move. His right hand still casually held the great hammer, his left hand raised, emitting brilliant light, and with just a light pat forward. With a puff, Ge Qianxun’s palm exploded, his entire right arm followed suit and burst open, and then his shoulder was torn apart as well. If not for his ruthlessness at the critical moment, using his other hand to sever his shoulder, half of his body might have been torn apart.

Ge Qianxun was horrified. What kind of Heavenly Radiance Force combination had the opponent fused? Could it be a combination of techniques from those mysterious great sects? It was simply too terrifying!

Qin Ming stepped forward calmly, quickly gave him a hammer strike, shattering his left arm. “Now it’s symmetrical.”

“You…” Ge Qianxun staggered, his face as pale as paper, covered in blood, too severely injured. Qin Ming left an afterimage in place, lightly brushed his chest with the Yellow Mud Palm, causing Ge Qianxun to vomit blood profusely and fly horizontally, crashing into a large tree, then falling to the ground. So-called ‘soft’ force can also be rigid. Qin Ming didn’t take his life, because this man was a Golden Thief; he wanted to leave him for Meng Xinghai.

Qin Ming squatted down, searched Ge Qianxun’s embrace, and took the package from him. He weighed it; the Daylight Gold inside should not be a small sum. Most importantly, there was a secret manual in the package! “It seems to carry strong emotional fluctuations!” Qin Ming was delighted; this was more valuable to him than Daylight Gold. He left the forest and walked towards the river.

Dai Shifeng and his confidants were all frozen on the spot, sighing in relief after a long while. They felt that youth was too terrifying; Old Ge was just hammered apart so easily by him?

“Qin Ming!” The youth in muddy clothes emerged from the mud, extremely resentful, no longer able to maintain his detached demeanor and arrogance.

Qin Ming looked at him calmly. “You said there was no longer any friendship between us. I entirely spared you because of your cousin, Wang Caiwei, and didn’t shoot you down with an arrow while you were in the sky. If you continue to be reckless, you won’t have a future.”

The youth in muddy clothes had his entire face caked with mud, and now hearing these words, his body seemed to tremble, and he clenched his fists. Qin Ming sighed, not expecting Ning Siqi to appear; he was once one of his best friends, and now it had come to this. It was impossible for him not to be touched. Back then, they had a very close relationship, but not long ago, the other party had said such heartless, face-tearing words. If it had been anyone else, Qin Ming could have accepted it, but it was Ning Siqi who appeared, treating him with disdain and mockery.

“Do you like your cousin, which is why, even when we called each other brothers long ago, you already disliked me in your heart?” Qin Ming asked.

This sentence broke Ning Siqi’s composure. He was filled with immense grief and indignation, saying, “Today, I was shot down into the mud by you, and humiliated like this, destined to become a joke in our circle. Come, let’s fight to the death!”

“You’re too dirty, go wash yourself in the river,” Qin Ming said calmly.

Only old acquaintances understand each other best. This remark completely shattered Ning Siqi, who prided himself on having the demeanor of Wei and Jin scholars and being refined and unconventional. He trembled all over, let out a loud shout, and actually jumped into the river. Ning Siqi loved wearing white clothes, and at this moment, he was covered in filth, even disgusted with himself.

With disheveled hair, he gnashed his teeth and came up, saying, “Qin Ming, you really are something, you’re utterly ruthless!”

Qin Ming looked at him, saying, “I’m a bit confused. As the employer, why would you directly show your face and personally come to monitor the scene? It doesn’t fit your style.”

Ning Siqi gnashed his teeth and said, “Yes, I was foolish, I regret coming here and being humiliated by you in every possible way. If this gets out, I’ll definitely become a laughingstock! Let’s fight, let me see how far your Rebirth path has gone,” Ning Siqi said, then asked again, “Has Meng Xinghai still not appeared?”

Qin Ming looked at him, not speaking.

“Ge Qianxun was dealt with by Meng Xinghai’s people, right?” Ning Siqi had heard the huge sonic boom from the dense forest earlier.

“Scared? So you also know that Old Meng and I are very close,” Qin Ming said.

“I personally witnessed Zhao Jingshuo being captured by you, how could I not know.” Ning Siqi made the first move. As he approached, he said, “I bought a book, I’ll rub mud…” He was slapped flying by Qin Ming and fell into the mud pit again.

“You’re actually this strong?” Ning Siqi was very shocked. The news he received was that Qin Ming had disappeared for two years, and after reappearing, only embarked on the Rebirth path in the last two or three months.

“Ge Qianxun was blown up by me with three hammer strikes and two palm strikes,” Qin Ming said.

“It seems you’ll have to make me use my true strength!” Ning Siqi’s bones crackled all over, and he went to wash himself in the river again. As he approached again, he moved and said, “I’ve prepared a secret manual for you, it’s many times more profound than the Rebirth technique you practiced in that remote place.”

Qin Ming had felt something was off earlier, and when he heard these words, his expression subtly changed, but he still attacked. “The mocking and humiliating words I said to you earlier were the exact words spoken by some of your old acquaintances. If I hadn’t come today, people who once intensely hated you would have personally sought you out to deal with you,” Ning Siqi said quickly.

Qin Ming didn’t speak, and twice more threw him into the mud pit, making Ning Siqi furious. “I still thought you liked your cousin and deliberately targeted me.”

“Get lost!” Ning Siqi only uttered one word. “I personally came here, not hesitating to disgrace myself, to detonate this matter before them, only to be met with such humiliation from you!” At this moment, Ning Siqi’s anger flared intensely.

“What kind of ‘detonation’ is this? Does it have any meaning?” Qin Ming said, attacking him while looking at him.

Ning Siqi said, “It’s enough for the matter to blow up. I’ve already found a reliable person to go to the secluded realm and send an anonymous letter to Cui Qi, hoping he receives it smoothly. If he comes out of seclusion and reads the letter, knowing that people from aristocratic families are humiliating and even trying to kill you this way, with his uncle-nephew relationship with you, he will definitely be enraged. He will ignore the obstruction of those old elders of the Cui family and come out to warn all parties, possibly even killing some aristocratic family descendants! When you see him then, clarify immediately that I disgraced myself like this for your sake, so he doesn’t actually kill me.”

“Siqi!” Qin Ming only uttered these two words.

“Practicing randomly in a remote place won’t do; the combination of Heavenly Radiance Force is very particular. If you casually practice and merge low-level cultivation techniques, something will go wrong in the future,” Ning Siqi told him, saying he had prepared a very powerful cultivation technique, with a complete system, enough for him to cultivate to a very profound realm.

“High-level Will-Energy Art?” Qin Ming asked.

“It’s much more valuable than that, belonging to a relatively rare secret manual. It contains combinations of Heavenly Radiance Force; you don’t need to practice them individually, it’s a wondrous technique after fusion.” He quickly told him the location of the hidden book. Ning Siqi added, “I didn’t prepare spiritual substances for you; go hunt for them yourself, which will also temper you. Alright, I admit I’m a bit tight on funds and couldn’t buy higher-end spiritual substances. After I secretly hired someone to bid on that rare secret manual for you, I didn’t have much Daylight Gold left.”

“Siqi, I don’t know how to thank you,” Qin Ming said, a warmth in his heart. After such great ups and downs, he didn’t have many friends left. To have such an old acquaintance filled him with mixed emotions, and even made his eyes sting.

Ning Siqi said, “Don’t be deceived by other old acquaintances; there are only two or three old friends like me left. Many people have deep, malicious intentions.” When he learned that Qin Ming already possessed such strength at the Fourth Rebirth stage, he was instantly shocked. “Although you’re not Cui Chonghe with near-immortal aptitude, your current talent is very promising!” He was somewhat moved, saying, “Initially, I thought you’d have a very miserable time here, not even having a suitable Rebirth technique.”
