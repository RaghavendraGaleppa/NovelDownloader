# Chapter 52: Is This Really Reclamation?

Entering the outer sect, Chu Ning made his way to Zhuang Yunde's residence with familiar ease. Unexpectedly, he encountered Mu Ling along the way.

"Junior Brother Chu, I heard you'd be coming to deliver your harvest soon," Mu Ling said with a slight tilt of her head, smiling knowingly at him.

No longer confused or wary as before, Chu Ning immediately retrieved talisman paper from his storage pouch. "I was just planning to visit Senior Sister after seeing Senior Brother Zhuang. These are the extra talisman papers after submitting this season's quota to the sect. I wonder if Senior Sister needs this much."

Mu Ling's eyes immediately lit up. "How many?"

"Three thousand sheets," Chu Ning replied.

"So many! Then I won't worry about wasting..." Mu Ling began excitedly before catching herself. She composed her expression and smoothed her hair. "This way, I can properly practice talisman-making."

The transaction was quickly settled—Chu Ning handed over the 3,000 sheets of talisman paper in exchange for sixty spirit stones. The thought of offering a discount for bulk purchase never crossed his mind. If he didn't profit from this, who else would?

As Mu Ling turned to leave with the talisman paper, Chu Ning quickly spoke up: "Senior Sister Mu, I've become quite familiar with various merchants in the market while purchasing talisman paper recently. I should be able to source more. Would you like to buy additional quantities?"

"Buy! Buy!" Mu Ling immediately exclaimed. "Get as much as you can."

After a moment's thought, she added, "With these 3,000 sheets, I can wait a month. For the following month, you can purchase more."

Chu Ning nodded. "Then I'll procure 1,500 sheets for Senior Sister each month."

He currently had 7,900 sheets remaining in his storage pouch. Selling 1,500 sheets monthly over four months would total 6,000 sheets, leaving him with 1,900 for personal use—enough for his planned promotion assessment.

If Mu Ling's earlier information held true and promotion offered access to talisman-making techniques, these papers would suffice for practice. Unlike Mu Ling's extravagant usage, Chu Ning couldn't afford such wastefulness.

Mu Ling nodded in agreement and produced ten additional spirit stones from her pouch, bringing the monthly payment to thirty-two stones. "Then make it 500 extra sheets each month."

After a pause, she added three more stones and handed them to Chu Ning. "For your efforts during this period."

Accepting the payment, Chu Ning watched Mu Ling's light-footed departure with silent amazement. What a spendthrift woman. But the profit felt undeniably satisfying—these three stones plus the monthly delivery fee totaled five stones, equivalent to what cultivators like Qiu Shunyi might earn from an entire season's harvest after sect contributions.

Then again, with a Golden Core stage grandaunt backing her, such sums meant little. Chu Ning pocketed the stones without qualms.

After storing all the spirit stones, Chu Ning proceeded to Zhuang Yunde's courtyard. The rotund cultivator greeted him with his characteristic smile. "Ah, Chu Ning! I was just planning to visit your area this afternoon."

"Senior Brother Zhuang, I've come to deliver my harvest." Chu Ning produced 3,500 sheets of talisman paper and eleven additional spirit stones.

Zhuang Yunde chuckled knowingly. "Met Mu Ling again?"

Chu Ning nodded. "Sold her the surplus talisman paper."

Without further comment, Zhuang Yunde deftly stored the items in separate pouches. Seizing the moment, Chu Ning stated his purpose directly: "Senior Brother Zhuang, do I register for the promotion assessment to District C with you?"

"You're applying for promotion?" Zhuang Yunde showed mild surprise before his expression shifted to realization after scanning Chu Ning. "Ah, you've reached Qi Refinement fourth layer—meeting the requirements indeed." He smiled appreciatively. "Reaching fourth layer within eighteen months is quite rapid progress."

Chu Ning cupped his hands respectfully. "Thanks to Senior Brother's guidance and the spirit stones earned, all invested in cultivation. I officially entered mid-stage Qi Refinement last month."

Zhuang Yunde nodded. "Your natural affinity with the Evergreen Wood Art coupled with resource support explains the speed." His tone then shifted. "However, promotion assessments aren't under my authority. You'll need to register with Deacon He for approval."

"Deacon He Changyou?" Chu Ning verified.

Zhuang Yunde confirmed. "Given your eighteen-month progression to fourth layer and solid spell mastery, Deacon He will likely approve. But competition is fierce—prepare yourself mentally."

With solemn expression, Chu Ning responded, "I plan to use spirit stones for intensive cultivation these coming weeks. Whether promoted or not, I hope for Senior Brother's continued guidance." His gratitude was genuine—despite his cheat-like advantage, Zhuang Yunde's facilitation had been instrumental in his progress and earnings.

Zhuang Yunde's round face softened, then took on a pensive expression. "I'd gladly continue mentoring newcomers like you, but my time may be limited. I'll be departing soon."

Chu Ning started. "Senior Brother is leaving?"

After hesitation, Zhuang Yunde disclosed: "You've been here eighteen months—surely heard the sect periodically dispatches Qi Refinement disciples on external missions every year or two."

Chu Ning recalled Shang Zhaoxiang's past remarks and blurted, "The rumored reclamation of newly discovered resource lands? But I heard only servant disciples were assigned. Is Senior Brother going to oversee operations there?"

Zhuang Yunde gave a mixed response. "I am involved, but not as overseer. Moreover, your information is incomplete—inner and outer sect disciples were initially dispatched. Servant disciples were only recruited later due to manpower shortages."

"Shortages?" Chu Ning murmured before voicing his long-standing doubt. "Senior Brother Zhuang, with so many Qi Refinement disciples sent, is this truly reclamation? I've never heard of anyone returning."

Zhuang Yunde's expression grew complex at the question. Observing this, Chu Ning sensed he'd touched upon something confidential.
