# Chapter 118: The Tenth Void Heaven  

The outside world.  

The top ten names on the Spiritual Essence Ranking suddenly began to flicker.  

Everyone turned their gazes in unison.  

**[Fifth: Zhang Jing (Qi Refinement Tenth Layer · Eighty-Second Step · Dragon Lake Dao Academy)]**  

For a moment, silence reigned.  

Before long, dozens of complex gazes fell upon a stern-looking elder with a goatee—the master of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion of Dragon Lake Dao Academy. Among them were looks of envy, jealousy, and even indignation.  

Of course, the most indignant gaze came from the master of the Inheritance Pavilion, whose form continuously shifted between old, middle-aged, and young.  

"Nine months to achieve perfect comprehension of Dao Intent—such formidable talent belongs on the Upper Realm's stage," he muttered.  

The master of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion appeared calm and indifferent on the surface, but inwardly, he was overwhelmed with immense joy.  

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Qi. With perfect Dao Intent, he can begin forging a Golden Dao Foundation upon his return," said Nong Xingzhou, the renowned chief of the Spiritual Dao Pavilion of Dragon Lake Dao Academy.  

The two were not even on the same level.  

A soft voice suddenly reached the ears of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion master.  

"Go ahead and laugh. I can see the corners of your mouth twitching—it must be painful to hold it in."  

The master of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion suppressed his urge to grin.  

"Mustn't laugh, mustn't laugh. The Thousand Techniques Pavilion has already stolen the spotlight this time. If I act too smug, who knows if some old monster might take offense and scheme against me."  

As he pondered, Qiu Han, the chief of the Spiritual Dao Pavilion, spoke nonchalantly.  

"Fellow Daoist Qi, do you intend for him to ascend to the Upper Realm this time?"  

The master of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion sighed.  

"Fellow Daoist, it's difficult. The time is too short."  

The only possible explanation was that Zhang Jing had already achieved perfect comprehension of Dao Intent—otherwise, how could he have reached the Tenth Void Heaven?  

A black-robed man gasped. "Nine months to perfect Dao Intent! Junior Sister, sharing an era with such a monster—I don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse."  

Given the nature of the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven, the higher the Void Heaven one reached, the greater the spiritual essence obtained—tenfold, even dozens of times more.  

Zhang Jing gazed at the floating islands of varying sizes before him, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes.  

"The Tenth Void Heaven has three senior brothers. I’ll hold off on visiting them for now—finding that inheritance is more urgent."  

The islands appeared to drift lightly, yet not even the fiercest gales could budge them.  

"Someone’s coming," a voice suddenly cut through the howling winds.  

"It must be Junior Brother Zhang Jing."  

Qiu Han nodded.  

"Ah, he just ascended to the Tenth Void Heaven."  

A black-robed man scratched his head in confusion.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing? Wasn’t he in the Ninth Void Heaven?"  

The other two academy masters chimed in with congratulations.  

"Junior Brother, you too."  

Soon after, a black-clad man spoke honestly.  

"Indeed, another Senior Brother You—no, someone even more terrifying than Senior Brother You."  

Zhang Jing felt a familiar sensation gradually intensify, like a beacon lighting up before him.  

"It really is in the Tenth Void Heaven."  

Without hesitation, he activated the Dao Origin Celebration Cloud Dao Seed.  

A dazzling radiance erupted.  

At the apex of the Void Heaven, near the dome, lay an island spanning a hundred li, unmoved by the relentless gales.  

Strangely, the entire island was composed of a massive piece of pitch-black ironstone, devoid of any greenery, its dark surface gleaming faintly.  

At its center floated a pearl-sized orb of pure white spiritual light.  

Qiu Han pointed at the orb and asked curiously,  

"Have you two noticed anything about this?"  

The black-robed man shook his head.  

"Junior Brother hasn’t discerned anything yet, only that it’s incredibly profound—likely concealing some great secret."  

The orb remained inert, emitting no aura, visible only to the naked eye and imperceptible to spiritual sense.  

Yet it exuded an overwhelming allure.  

A moment later, a spatial rift silently appeared and vanished just as quickly, leaving behind a youthful figure.  

Qi Refinement Realm. Tenth Void Heaven.  

Zhang Jing had arrived.  

---  

Elsewhere, the Dragon Lake Academy Master sighed in frustration.  

"Fellow Daoists, is there truly no way for Zhang Jing to make it onto this year’s True Spirit Ranking?"  

The Xuan Light Academy Master shook his head.  

"Fellow Daoist, we understand your sentiments, but forging a Golden Dao Foundation alone would take more than two years."  

The Divine Thunder Academy Master added regretfully,  

"Alas, the same for me. Knowing there’s a great opportunity here yet being unable to seize it—how frustrating."  

The Dragon Lake Academy Master suddenly mused,  

"Since he’s already achieved perfect Dao Intent, all that remains is constructing his foundation. After some thought, forcing Zhang Jing to wait 180 years in the academy before ascending would be a waste of his time."  

Qiu Han sighed again, glancing at the Spiritual Essence Ranking and spotting his junior sister in the Third Void Heaven.  

"Junior Sister Qin Nian, competing with such a monster in the same era—what fortune or misfortune is this?"  

He couldn’t help but recall how, before the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven opened, he had specifically warned her to pay attention to a junior brother from Dragon Lake named Zhang Jing.  

But now, it seemed the advice had been pointless.  

The master of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion clicked his tongue in amazement.  

This speed far exceeded his expectations—even the academy masters hadn’t anticipated it.  

"Ha, at least I made my move first."  

The thought nearly made him laugh aloud, but he quickly schooled his expression.  

Meanwhile, the chief of the Spiritual Dao Pavilion, Nong Xingzhou, remarked sourly,  

"The current chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion has a Golden Dao Foundation, and now the next one will too? How absurd."  

The Inheritance Pavilion master could only seethe silently.  

They had once had a chance to recruit that prodigy—only for this old fox to snatch him away!  

What a pity.  

Yet, before entering the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven, who could have predicted such an outcome?  

Now, Zhang Jing was doomed to languish in the Lower Realm for 180 years.  

What a waste.  

But then again, the scene before him was undeniably breathtaking.  

The Tenth Void Heaven was unlike the previous nine.  

Here, the islands floated amidst eternal gales, untouched by the tempests, exuding an ethereal majesty.  

Zhang Jing took it all in, his heart set on one goal—  

Find the inheritance.
