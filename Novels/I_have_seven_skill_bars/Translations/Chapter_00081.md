# Chapter 81: Failure!

"Do you know your name?" Ding Rui asked. Since the Green Hornet had awakened, he hadn't had a deep conversation with it.

"Isn't it Green Hornet?" the Green Hornet replied.

"How do you know that?"

"Didn't you name me?"

"You hadn't gained sentience back then!" Ding Rui was a little surprised.

"Even though I hadn't gained sentience, I could still remember things. Besides, for us bee cultivators, all we do is collect nectar daily, brew honey, and cultivate diligently. What else is there to remember? I couldn't forget," the Green Hornet said.

"I see." Ding Rui nodded, then added, "Can I see your true form? Your most core appearance, do you understand? The one called the Bee Queen before you gained sentience."

He knew there was a Bee Queen in the hive, and after gaining sentience, that should be the bee cultivator's true form.

"I understand what you mean, but it's not very convenient," the Green Hornet said. "My true form is too large now; it can only stay inside the hive and can't come out. There's nothing much to see anyway."

"These bees are all born from me. To you, they are my children, but in reality, they are parts of my body. Our cultivation resources come from the stray spiritual energy between heaven and earth and the pollen of various spiritual flowers."

"Furthermore, we can brew honey by self-regulating, then use that honey to strengthen ourselves and become more numerous and larger. Our cultivation is tied to our numbers. Once we reach a certain level of cultivation, we can give birth to various powerful bees, depending on our environment and the challenges we face. Don't think we're weak now; when that time comes, we won't be easy to mess with at all..." the Green Hornet continued.

"How do you create different kinds of bees? Shouldn't they all be the same?" Ding Rui interrupted, thinking of the Zerg he used to see on TV.

"We can do it because each bee is merely a part of my body. I can adjust and experiment, just like how human cultivators create various functional spell formations. It's the same principle, and furthermore..."

The night was dark and windy, the moon hidden by dark clouds.

In the dark 520 spirit field, after talking for most of the night, Ding Rui finally fell into a deep sleep. He had been too busy lately, with no room for even a moment of slack. Fortunately, the spirit field cultivators were becoming more familiar with the Meridial Flowers, so he would probably be able to relax a little soon.

The next day.

Ding Rui was awakened by the sound of the spirit field's spell formation. Opening the door, he found that the cultivators Jiang She had sent to help him manage the spirit field had arrived. As the most important person in the entire Mystic Talisman Sect's spirit fields, from this day forward, Ding Rui would have to dedicate almost all his time to tasks that other spirit field cultivators found less straightforward.

And the Meridial Flowers would produce new pollen from their closed stamens every day. As long as the *Azure Wood Art* absorption proceeded without issues, pollen would be produced continuously, eliminating the need to plant new Meridial Flowers.

During this process, naturally, most of the Meridial Flowers were lost due to various accidents. Some were accidentally killed by other cultivators during spiritual energy absorption, and a very small number failed to absorb enough and thus perished, requiring replanting. Ding Rui was not a god, after all. Although he tried his best to help, he ultimately could not attend to every single spirit field. He could only look after a small portion of the Mystic Talisman Sect's spirit fields, let alone those of other sects.

Yet, even so, the current harvest of Meridial Flowers had already exceeded the expectations of the sect domain. Nearly a hundred spirit fields had Meridial Flowers that survived and consistently produced pollen. And Ding Rui almost single-handedly supported more than ten spirit fields! Although these Meridial Flowers couldn't provide an absolute advantage or change the tide of battle, they ultimately brought significant relief to the cultivators on the front lines.
