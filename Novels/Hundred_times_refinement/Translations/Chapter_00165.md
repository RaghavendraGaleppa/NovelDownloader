# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 113: An Old Acquaintance  

Lin Xuan took out a pill and placed it in his mouth. It dissolved instantly, leaving behind a faintly sweet fragrance.  

He then activated the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art, quickly transforming into a completely different appearance.  

Satisfied, Lin Xuan nodded and took another pill. After its medicinal properties dissolved, he guided it into his dantian, where it formed a gaseous sphere that effortlessly concealed his spiritual power.  

He named this pill the Spirit-Concealing Pill!  

---  

Six months later.  

Lin Xuan had fully integrated into the Spirit Medicine Mountain. Unlike other sects, the cultivators here were rarely seen in daily life.  

Apart from Elder Tongyu, Lin Xuan knew very few disciples, and none could be considered close.  

But that didn’t matter—he hadn’t joined the sect sincerely in the first place. His goal was to get his hands on the discarded pills.  

Though he hadn’t yet taken action, he was inching closer to his objective.  

The first step was to earn Elder Tongyu’s trust.  

Thanks to his ability to refine waste into treasure, Lin Xuan had no worries about pill refinement. If a batch failed, he could simply purify it into a finished product.  

Of course, he carefully controlled his performance—showing enough talent to impress but not so much as to seem unnatural.  

Even so, Elder Tongyu was delighted. While Lin Xuan’s alchemy skills weren’t yet on par with his own, considering his youth, he had the potential to reach even greater heights in cultivation and alchemy, ensuring the sect’s prosperity for generations.  

With this in mind, Elder Tongyu decided to name Lin Xuan the sect’s provisional successor—the future leader of Spirit Medicine Mountain after his own passing.  

"Master, this is absolutely unnecessary!"  

Lin Xuan was taken aback. Though he wasn’t a saint, he harbored no ill intentions toward the sect. His sole focus was the pursuit of immortality, and his interest in the discarded pills was merely a means to that end. Becoming the sect leader was never part of his plans.  

"Disciple, do not refuse. Your talent in alchemy far surpasses mine. You will surely elevate our sect to new heights. Passing the mantle to you is the natural choice!"  

After much persuasion, Lin Xuan found himself at a loss for words. Unable to reveal his true motives, he reluctantly accepted the position.  

Leaving Elder Tongyu’s quarters, Lin Xuan sighed. Truthfully, his master had treated him well. Though the disciples of Spirit Medicine Mountain were eccentric, they lacked the cutthroat ambition common among other cultivators.  

He enjoyed his time in the sect, but becoming its leader would bring heavy responsibilities—a burden he didn’t want, given his single-minded focus on cultivation.  

Yet, as he reconsidered, his worries faded. Elder Tongyu was only around 150 years old. Given a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s lifespan, he still had decades ahead. There was no need to fret for now.  

Moreover, his status as the future sect leader came with significant advantages. While some disciples were obsessed with alchemy and indifferent to worldly affairs, most still respected the position. This would make his plan to acquire discarded pills even easier.  

Lost in thought, Lin Xuan suddenly noticed a flash of white light as several people were teleported into the sect.  

The guide was an outer disciple responsible for receiving visitors. Lin Xuan recalled that today was indeed a day for external guests.  

At first, he paid little attention, merely glancing over. But then, his expression froze in surprise.  

Among the visitors was a familiar face—Ma Tianxiong!  

A former elite disciple of the Drifting Cloud Valley, whom Lin Xuan had encountered several times in the past.  

It was from him that Lin Xuan had first learned about the secret of supreme-grade pills.  

Of course, while Lin Xuan recognized him, Ma Tianxiong had no idea who he was. Their previous interactions had been under the guise of "Ye Tian," a persona Lin Xuan had assumed using the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art.  

Back then, Lin Xuan had been an obscure, low-ranking disciple in the Drifting Cloud Valley—someone Ma Tianxiong would never have noticed.  

The outer disciple leading the group immediately bowed respectfully upon seeing Lin Xuan. "Immortal Master!"  

Though Lin Xuan’s status as the provisional successor hadn’t been publicly announced, he was still Elder Tongyu’s personal disciple—a figure of considerable influence within the sect.  

The other cultivators, sharp-eyed as they were, noticed the disciple’s deferential attitude and grew curious. Could this young man be someone important in Spirit Medicine Mountain?  

Their attention shifted to Lin Xuan, and they were further shocked to sense his Foundation Establishment cultivation.  

He appeared to be under twenty years old—an astonishing achievement even for a prodigy from a major sect. Given that Spirit Medicine Mountain was known for alchemy rather than combat prowess, this was even more surprising.  

Could he have cultivated some unique technique?  

Rumors spoke of certain methods that preserved youth until death.  

Lin Xuan remained unfazed under their scrutiny. Casually, he asked, "Are these guests here for pill refinement?"  

"Yes!"  

"Very well. Take the others away. As for this one—" Lin Xuan pointed at Ma Tianxiong. "I’ll handle him personally."  

"As you command."  

The outer disciple was puzzled. Though rumors spoke of Lin Xuan’s alchemical prowess, he had never before taken on external refinement requests. Why now?  

But he wisely held his tongue and led the other cultivators away, leaving Ma Tianxiong behind.  

"Follow me."  

"Y-Yes."  

Unlike the confident figure Lin Xuan remembered, Ma Tianxiong now seemed nervous. He had come to Spirit Medicine Mountain seeking a rare pill to aid his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment.  

Being singled out by a Foundation Establishment expert right upon arrival left him uneasy—was this fortune or misfortune?  

Heart pounding, he followed silently, not daring to speak.  

"You’re a cultivator from Drifting Cloud Valley?"  

"How did you know, Senior?" Ma Tianxiong looked up in surprise.  

Lin Xuan chuckled. "Because I, too, hail from Yan Province."  

"Senior is also from Yan Province?"  

"Indeed." Lin Xuan rubbed his nose, slightly uncomfortable being addressed as "Senior" by a former sect brother. Of course, he couldn’t reveal the truth. "I was a rogue cultivator who once visited Drifting Cloud Valley and happened to see you from afar. Later, when your sect clashed with the Fire Spirit Sect, I chose to leave Yan Province rather than get involved. I’ve since made my way here to Youzhou."  

"Then how did Senior join Spirit Medicine Mountain?" Ma Tianxiong immediately regretted his question—curiosity could be dangerous. "Forgive my impertinence, Senior."  

"It’s fine." Lin Xuan waved it off, his gentle demeanor easing Ma Tianxiong’s nerves. "By chance, I met my master, Elder Tongyu, who recognized my talent for alchemy. Thus, I joined this sect."  

"Elder Tongyu? Senior is the sect leader’s disciple?"  

Ma Tianxiong’s eyes lit up with excitement. Though he had guessed Lin Xuan held a high position, he hadn’t expected such a prestigious connection. The pill he needed was extremely difficult to refine—if he could leverage this connection to request the sect leader’s assistance…  

But despite their shared origins, they had no real ties. How could he possibly make such a bold request?  

By now, they had arrived at Lin Xuan’s cave abode.  

Seated in the reception hall with fragrant tea, Lin Xuan took a sip. "It’s been nearly a year since I left Yan Province. Could you tell me how things are there now?"  

"Of course, Senior. I’ll share everything I know."  

Seeing an opportunity to build rapport, Ma Tianxiong eagerly launched into an explanation...  

Three incense sticks’ worth of time later.  

"What? The war of attrition in Yan Province is already over?"  

"Yes. The Fire Spirit Sect overreached—for some unknown reason, they turned on their own vassal clans and allied sects, slaughtering the cultivators of the Leaping Stream Gorge. Though they tried to keep it secret, word eventually spread. They became enemies of the entire Yan Province cultivation world and collapsed soon after."  

Lin Xuan frowned. While he had anticipated the Fire Spirit Sect’s downfall, he hadn’t expected it to happen so quickly. As the second-strongest sect in Yan Province, comparable to Drifting Cloud Valley, they should have held out longer, even under concerted attacks from opportunistic factions.  

"What Senior may not know is that the Fire Spirit Sect’s rapid defeat was largely due to the efforts of a genius from our sect—Qin Yan, Junior Sister Qin."  

"The Fairy of the Clouds?"
