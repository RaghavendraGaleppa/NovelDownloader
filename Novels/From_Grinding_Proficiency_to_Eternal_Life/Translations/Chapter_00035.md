# Chapter 35: Startling News

Xu Yunfan exhaled, the slightly bulging muscles on his body slowly relaxing.

He raised his palm to take a look. Earlier, when testing the water, he had used the back of his hand to硬接 (hardly receive/block) a steel blade. Aside from a white mark, there showed no other abnormalities.

His body was imperviable to weapons!

Xu Yunfan glanced at the attribute panel that appeared in his vision according to his thoughts.

‘……

Special Effects: Vital Qi is vast and vigorous; Strength penetrates the whole body; Skin is hard as iron; Muscles are strong and bones robust; Difficult for sharp weapons to invade; Can resist boulders; Extraordinary physical strength; Proficiency in hammer techniques.

……’

Among the special effects of the Red Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer, there are two called "Difficult for sharp weapons to invade" and "Skin is hard as iron," both providing him with immense defensive capabilities.

As long as he is careful enough, ordinary, non-treasured weapons find it hard to break his skin. He wondered just how sharp the "keen blade" mentioned by Li Haomiao was.

He swept a glance over the guards lying on the ground, all of whom had fainted. He hadn't hit them too hard, using only half his strength. Although these guards suffered injuries to their tendons and bones, their foundations weren't harmed. As long as they are properly nursed, there shouldn't be any sequelae.

After all, there was no great enmity or hatred between them.

Pushing open the storeroom door, what greeted his eyes were two rows of bookshelves extending inward, filled with all sorts of miscellaneous books and account books.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept past them and finally discovered several large and small chests in a corner.

He tore off the locks on the chests and lifted the lids open.

Rows of neatly arranged silver ingots were placed properly inside the chests. Even though Xu Yunfan had been bombarded with modern information in his previous life, seeing this scene of gold and silver still made his expression momentarily daze.

With this money, why would he need to run around hunting and fishing to earn living expenses?

Wouldn't that just be seeking unnecessary trouble?

After opening the remaining chests one after another, Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows slightly. He immediately hung the chest filled with small gold bars (Xiao Huangyu) in front of his chest and夹着 (clamped/wedged) one large chest under each arm.

They were heavy, but still acceptable. In fact, one could even say it was light. The small chest containing the small gold bars alone weighed over a hundred catties, while the chest containing silver ingots weighed at least five hundred catties.

A One-Practice Grandmaster (Wushi), the most obvious sign of their prowess is the ability to lift eight hundred catties with a single hand. If one, like Xu Yunfan, focused on physical training (Henglian) and followed the path of extreme ferocity, their physical strength would be even greater.

Securing the items properly, he quickly walked out of the storeroom.

He didn't stop for a moment, heading straight for the wall. Just as he was about to climb over the wall and leave, his expression moved slightly, and he shrank his figure into a corner.

"Is that weapon real?"

A voice filled with anxiety came urgently from the room nearby, the tone carrying an irrepressible agitation.

"Mind your words!"

Another, slightly older voice cut down like a sharp blade, admonishing him.

A brief silence followed.

After a long while, the elderly voice spoke again, carrying a heavy and worried tone.

"I don't know which link went wrong, but the news actually leaked out. Now, uninvited guests have sneaked into my Hu Mansion to inquire about the news. Once this matter is confirmed, my Hu family's century-old foundation will probably be destroyed!

Those people are all wolves and tigers."

"Dad, there are already formidable figures coming to spy on us. If we don't think of a way to deal with this soon, we won't be able to protect it! If this drags on for too long, City Guard Jiang Huaisheng won't be easy to deal with either. Our family only has Eldest Uncle as a Grandmaster, our strength is truly insufficient."

The room fell silent for a moment again before the elderly voice suddenly rang out, the tone carrying a hint of ruthlessness.

"Tomorrow, spread the news in the city, saying that the other families also have related clues. As long as we can divert most of the attention away, we can temporarily protect ourselves and plan for the long term from there.

Perhaps, it might even be thought to be false. After all... every year, there are clues about divine weapons everywhere, but the vast majority of them are baseless. As long as the rumors are spread, many people will naturally think it's fake again."

Divine weapon.

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly, and he subconsciously touched the sharp fragment hanging on his chest.

This fragment, which came from the shattered Purple Gold Earth-Shaking Hammer, could still easily slice open a bloody wound on his body even with his current physical training physique.

His thoughts turned, but in the end, he suppressed the fluctuations in his heart. The top priority was to find a place to stay, then look for a bone-forging martial art to practice the Outer Three Unions. Otherwise, the Pure Yang One Qi Technique could only stand by and watch helplessly.

He now had multiple martial arts waiting to be practiced. This divine weapon had attracted so many people's covetous gazes. If he rashly participated, he might not gain any benefits and would only get himself into trouble.

Now that he had carried away so much silver, it was enough for him to live the comfortable life of a wealthy master before his martial arts were perfected. At that time, he would also buy a few maids and learn the extravagant life of the masters of ancient times.

Moreover, if these two people were important figures of the Hu family, why were there no guards in front of the door, allowing them to hide here and discuss the matter of the divine weapon?

Was it a trap?

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. Taking advantage of the fact that no one was paying attention, he quickly climbed over the wall and left the Hu Mansion.

"Master, it's terrible!!"

A series of urgent knocks on the door instantly sounded, interrupting the discussion between Hu Hong, the head of the Hu family, and his son, Hu Feiang.

Hu Hong's brow furrowed instantly, and his heart tightened.

"Come in."

A guard, holding his arm and carrying a long saber with a pale face, walked into the room and said, "Our... our storeroom was robbed. Several chests containing gold and silver are missing."

The guard then explained that the Eldest Master had shouted from a distance, and most of the brothers guarding the storeroom had gone to support him.

Hu Hong didn't pay much attention to that, only asking, "Is my elder brother, Hu Yan, alright?"

"The Eldest Master is fine. After driving away that strong robber, he is now tightening the security of the entire mansion."

Hearing this, Hu Hong let out a sigh of relief and said slowly, "If it's lost, it's lost. This matter is not your fault. Strengthen the vigilance from now on."

Hu Yan was the only One-Practice Grandmaster in the Hu family who had perfected the Muscle Refining stage. He had great hope of stepping into the Grand Completion stage in Bone Refining. Naturally, he couldn't suffer any loss. Although the Hu family only operated within North Ye City, they were one of the top families in the city. Their industries were widespread, and with proper management, their wealth was the most abundant among the city's families.

"How much was lost?"

Hu Hong sat down and asked casually.

The guard lowered his voice and said, "Manager Hu is still counting. He sent me to report first. Preliminary estimates put the total value of the gold and silver lost at nearly thirty thousand taels."

Hu Hong felt a stifling sensation in his chest, his expression becoming extremely interesting.

Even though his family was wealthy and powerful, with businesses reaching the state capital, a sum of thirty thousand taels of silver was still the accumulation of several years of their family's operations.

After a long while, Hu Hong slammed the teacup in his hand to the ground in a rage. "Good thieves!! I will definitely make you pay!"

Uneventfully, he climbed over the wall and entered the inn he had预定 (booked/reserved) in the evening. Xu Yunfan put down the chests gently and silently.

After carefully counting the items, he let out a long breath, a look of joy on his face. Tomorrow, he just needed to find an agency (Yahang) to buy a courtyard house to settle down. After that, he could practice martial arts peacefully and look for a way to join a sect. Then, he would naturally have no worries.

Given that the room was too small, Xu Yunfan didn't bother practicing the Red Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer. After washing up, he simply sat cross-legged on the bed, formed the Hand Seal of the Lin Character (Lin Zi Yin), silently recited the Superior Goodness is Like Water Mind Mantra in his mouth, and gradually let his mind sink into a state of seeming emptiness yet not emptiness.
