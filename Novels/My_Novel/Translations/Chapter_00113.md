Chapter 113: Twenty Great Rods, the Mistress Imparts the Dao

At noon, the scorching sun hung high in the sky. It was already June, the heat intense and the summer air thick.

In the inner courtyard of the One-Union Manor.

Thanks to excellent Feng Shui, it was warm in winter and cool in summer, making it very comfortable.

Madam Wen sat in a long chair in the courtyard, her long hair like a waterfall cascading down. Dressed in a white silk gown that outlined her graceful and alluring figure, she sat with her eyes closed, resting.

"You have come."

She said indifferently without lifting her head or opening her eyes, seemingly enjoying the sunlight.

Li Xian had arrived early, yet he did not expect the Mistress to already be here. He immediately offered some words of apology. The Mistress waved her hand dismissively, saying nothing more, continuing to bask in the sun.

Left with no choice, Li Xian had to accompany her.

He was curious in his heart; it was the first time he saw the Mistress in such a leisurely state. She hadn't even tied up her long hair, letting it hang loose.

He also noticed her proud figure and her casual demeanor, yet her charm was naturally alluring. A faint scent of her hair wafted to his nose.

"Perform the Azure Silk Palm for me."

After half an hour, a thick cloud covered the sun, and the Mistress finally spoke.

"Alright!"

Li Xian dared not hold back. He immediately channeled his Qi into his palms, executing the moves slowly and gently, striking the air several times in succession. Gradually, the palm techniques became more complex, and the method of condensing Qi grew more intricate.

His body moved in harmony with his palms, performed in one breath. A moment later, the palm wind changed its nature, becoming like the surging waves of a great river, turbulent and mighty. The gusts of wind swept through the courtyard, causing Li Xian's long hair to fly.

Madam Wen was slightly taken aback. She had Li Xian perform the "Azure Silk Palm" merely to observe his martial foundation. To gauge a martial artist's temperament, character, and knowledge, one should look for clues in the martial arts they learn and use.

This was the Mistress's second layer of assessment.

The result, however, surprised her.

"This child has practiced the palm for about half a year. After I sent him to Black River Village and he returned, the Azure Silk Palm has actually reached perfection? Although he received my guidance, his aptitude must be quite good."

Upon closer inspection, even the well-informed Madam Wen found it quite astonishing. She observed Li Xian's execution of the palm technique and discovered that the movements, rhythm, and method of Qi circulation were all done excellently.

It felt as if it was achieved naturally, with a seamless and indescribable beauty.

"Very good." Madam Wen stood up, broke a peach tree branch, and lightly tapped it towards Li Xian.

Seeing that the Mistress wanted to test his martial skills, Li Xian immediately retaliated with his palm without holding back. He executed the move "Overturning River Azure Silk," a powerful attack and defense technique where both palms strike out simultaneously, the palm force resembling a surging river.

However, as soon as the palm force was formed and his palms were just about to strike, before they truly clashed, Li Xian, contemplating the subsequent changes in his moves, suddenly felt a chill. He realized with horror that no matter how he followed up, within the next ten moves, his throat would inevitably be slit.

It was like water flowing downwards or waves inevitably calming down; it was a certainty, unchangeable.

The Mistress held the branch and tapped it, a move of indescribable subtlety. In the instant she tapped, regardless of how Li Xian defended or changed his moves, there was only one outcome.

This was something the current Li Xian could not comprehend.

He could only retreat to advance, but the momentum of the Azure Silk Palm was like an incoming wave; how could it be retracted so easily?

Immediately, Li Xian reversed his palm force, slapping one palm on his lower abdomen and the other on his shoulder. His palm force dissipated, and he used the momentum to turn around and retreat, rolling backward.

"Oh?" Madam Wen lightly waved the branch and said, "Why would you rather injure yourself than retreat?"

"Replying to the Mistress," Li Xian said, cold sweat breaking out, looking somewhat disheveled. "If I had not retreated, I would have died within ten moves. I had no other choice but to injure myself to retreat immediately."

This brief exchange finally gave him a glimpse of the truth.

A martial artist of the Mistress's level, relying solely on her martial attainment and using just a tiny bit of force, was enough to leave him utterly defenseless.

"You are not wrong."

Madam Wen took a light step, the branch continuously pointing towards several of Li Xian's acupoints. "This Azure Silk Palm, though it is a decent technique, was created on a whim when I was watching a river."

"It contains many fatal flaws. You may use it within this Qingning County without worry. But if you go to a higher level, it would be no different from seeking your own death."

Li Xian cupped his hands and said, "Thank you for your guidance, Mistress."

Madam Wen raised her eyes to look at him, observing him carefully for a moment. A thought suddenly crossed her mind: *His eyebrows are clear, his eyes bright, his nose straight. Regardless of anything else, this child's appearance is truly excellent.*

This was the second time she had made such an assessment.

Compared to last time, Li Xian had grown, becoming more spirited, handsome, and mature. Though still a youth, having experienced the events at Black River Village, he now possessed a composure that could command a place, and a masculine spirit that radiated from within.

"You have practiced the palm for half a year and achieved perfection, which shows you have quite a talent for the Azure Silk Palm," Madam Wen said. "If one traces martial arts back to their source, one can always find the origin. This Azure Silk Palm is no exception. It was inspired by a certain technique. However, that technique is not a martial art, so I will not teach it to you."

Madam Wen's tone was calm.

She did not know that Li Xian had already witnessed the initial scene of her creating the martial art.

Madam Wen lightly lifted the branch, using it to lift Li Xian's chin slightly. "Are you willing to learn sword arts?"

Li Xian thought to himself, *Why lift my chin to teach me sword arts? I almost thought you were infatuated with my looks.* He said, "Whatever the Mistress teaches, I will learn."

Madam Wen raised an eyebrow. She broke another peach branch and tossed it to Li Xian. "Since you are learning sword arts, use a branch to substitute for a sword for now."

"Today, I shall teach you... The Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword. This is a superior sword art, very rare. However, if I were to teach you all of it, you would not be able to digest it. I will teach you the first layer for now. Once you have mastered it, I will teach you the second."

Li Xian said, "Alright."

Madam Wen immediately began to impart the sword art. She did not demonstrate it herself, only offering guidance from the side. "This sword art is easy to learn but difficult to master. When you practice this sword, you will feel drowsy and fatigued."

"Do not worry, it is a normal phenomenon."

Li Xian used the branch as a sword and practiced according to the method. Gradually, he felt the profoundness of the sword technique. At the same time... he secretly cried out in his heart that this was not good.

*Just from the name 'Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword,' you know it can't be anything good.*

*Given the Mistress's character, this martial art likely won't be given to me for free. I'd be better off not practicing it. But... the Mistress is watching me here. If I don't practice, she'll see through me immediately.*

Li Xian had to grit his head and go through with it.

He followed the method and brandished the long branch.

The method of practicing this sword was peculiar. While executing the sword moves, one also had to supplement it with a specific method of circulating blood.

[You have grasped the入门 method of the Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword]
[Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword · First Layer]
[Mastery: 19/1000 (Entry)]
[Description: This sword technique is of a superior grade. It was originally the Yang chapter of the paired sword technique "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword," but after Wen Caishang privately changed its name and made deletions and modifications, it became the 'Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword'.]
[Since this sword technique was剥离 from a paired technique, it possesses a fatal flaw. After reaching the entry level, if the martial art does not advance, and it does not receive nourishment from the Yin Sword, the body's blood will decay and evaporate.]
[The Dao of Yin and Yang is infinitely marvelous.]
[When Yin and Yang restrain each other, if Yin is strong, Yang follows; if Yang is strong, Yin follows.]
[If the Yang chapter's sword master's attainment exceeds the Yin chapter's sword master, the reverse will occur...]

Li Xian used the branch as a sword and suddenly thrust it forward, a sharp whistling sound breaking the air. A trace of heat rose from Li Xian's Dantian; this was the sign of the sword art's entry level.

The Yang energy in his body condensed and sank into the Qi Lake in his Dantian.

Madam Wen smiled with satisfaction. "Not bad, not bad. You have already entered the entry level."

"Cultivate this Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword well. Once a month, I will find time to give you guidance."

Li Xian had suffered a hidden loss, but it was, after all, a superior martial art, so his feelings were complex. He pretended to be happy and said, "Thank you for your high regard, Mistress! I will live up to your expectations and practice this sword art diligently."

Madam Wen nodded. "Good." She thought to herself, *I practice the Yin chapter, and this child practices the Yang chapter. In this way, he cannot脱离 from me. If I truly invest resources to nurture him, I won't be afraid of it being a waste.*

"Mistress, this subordinate takes his leave," Li Xian said, cupping his hands.

"Go," said Madam Wen.

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

Li Xian was practicing martial arts in the courtyard.

[Azure Silk Palm]
[Mastery: 53/80000 (Pinnacle)]

As his mastery accumulated enough, it broke through to the Pinnacle realm. The Qi Lake in his body surged like a geyser, expanding from thirty-six feet to forty-five feet...

Various martial arts insights flooded his mind.

The flaws and shortcomings of the martial art... were all clearly visible.

"Perhaps after my martial arts reach the Pinnacle, I can rely on my own understanding to gradually fill in the fatal flaws of the Azure Silk Palm."

Li Xian was not discouraged.

Now, of his five martial arts, three had reached the Pinnacle.

Such attainment would be hard to find a second person in the entire Qingning County.

[Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword · First Layer]
[Mastery: 594/1000 (Entry)]

In the following time, he focused mainly on this sword art.

"The Mistress is truly a person who does nothing without profit."

"She taught me this sword art to control me. This also shows that she might... truly invest energy to cultivate me."

"Otherwise, why would she need to restrict me? From this, it can be seen that she... is probably different from Commander Pang and Hua Hanying. But... it is because of my younger brother."

"It's really hard to say whether this is a good or bad thing."

Li Xian's sword art had just entered the entry level, and his execution was somewhat rigid, but his daily progress was evident.

"This Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword was originally a paired sword technique. It would require a Yin sword partner to practice with to progress rapidly. If the sword art does not advance for a long time, it will burn one's own blood, causing mental fatigue and loss of blood energy."

"But I also heard something about 'Yin strong, Yang follows' and 'Yang strong, Yin follows'. Does this mean that if my attainment in this sword art surpasses the Mistress's, I might be able to restrain her instead?"

He did not rule out this possibility, but Li Xian did not dare to think too far ahead.

"Regardless, I think... my current situation might allow me to truly ask the Mistress about some matters of the martial Dao!"

Li Xian sheathed his long branch, his eyes filled with excitement.

Inner Courtyard.

"You want to understand the affairs of martial artists?"

Madam Wen was dining in the main hall, the table filled with delicacies. Seeing Li Xian approach, she did not seem to reject him.

Li Xian nodded. "Replying to the Mistress, I am truly curious."

"Just curious?" Madam Wen looked at him with a smile.

Li Xian said, "If... if the Mistress could grant me a sliver of an opportunity, this subordinate would be willing to go through fire and water to pursue it."

"You are留守 in the manor, so even if you reach the 'Food Essence' realm, it would mostly be useless. Why are you so eager? Is it because you want to go to the Prefecture City to see your younger brother?" Madam Wen's probing was always subtle.

Li Xian shook his head. "I do miss my younger brother. But the real reason is not my younger brother, but... this subordinate dares not say, for fear of the Mistress's punishment."

"Go on and say it. If you don't, I will punish you," Madam Wen said with curiosity.

This little commander was more interesting than the previous ones.

Li Xian had already prepared his words.

To deal with the Mistress, showing true feelings is useless, and so is being straightforward. One must proactively show the value that can be utilized and the space that can be exploited.

Li Xian was penniless; there was nothing about him that the Mistress would value. He could only try to show his loyalty to trade for a path to the martial Dao.

But showing loyalty cannot be done directly. Otherwise, he would end up in the same situation as Pang Long. Ordinary loyalty, mediocre loyalty, what use would it be to the Mistress?

Li Xian大胆 (boldly) made an attempt:

"I once heard Commander Pang say that people of the Mistress's caliber are divine beings who have undergone a transformation from flesh and bone."

"We, the clay vessels, are born of lowly status, struggling and drifting in this muddy world. Now that my younger brother has seized the fortune, that is his ability. But as his older brother, I am unwilling to fall too far behind him."

"If his fellow students were to know that his older brother is a lowly clay vessel, wouldn't that be too embarrassing for him?"

"Of course, these are all minor matters. In the end, it's just about face. The key point is that after receiving the Mistress's guidance, when I practice martial arts, I can't help but admire the Mistress... and my thoughts have become increasingly wild..."

"That's why I couldn't restrain myself and wanted to go a step further, to ask for a glimpse of the scenery above... Please punish me, Mistress!"

Madam Wen said meaningfully, "Is that all?"

Li Xian said, "Yes!"

Madam Wen sneered. "You are quite bold."

"Go and receive twenty great rods yourself. First, let's dispel those wild thoughts of yours."

Saying this, her tone softened. She took a small sip of tea and said nonchalantly:

"As for the Dao of Food Essence, what's so great about it? There's no harm in giving you some guidance."
