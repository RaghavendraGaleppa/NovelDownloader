# Chapter 79: Rigged! This Is Absolutely Rigged!

"Water-element mutated Vermilion Fruit seed. When mature, its spiritual energy content is 15 times that of ordinary Vermilion Fruit, making it quite rare."

"This item is a mid-grade spiritual material that flowers and bears fruit after two hundred years. Currently, it's in perfect condition, having only been unearthed half a year ago. Fellow cultivators from sects and clans may want to take note—starting bid is 700 spirit stones."

Elder Zhang deliberately emphasized this auction item while subtly glancing toward the second-floor private boxes, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Lin Shan awkwardly scratched his head, realizing Elder Zhang had long seen through his lie about the seed being a family heirloom, yet had chosen not to expose his little scheme.

The auction hall fell into an eerie silence. Most Qi Condensation cultivators weren't interested—with lifespans barely exceeding a hundred years, who had two centuries to wait for it to mature? A finished spiritual fruit would have been more appealing.

However, while the common cultivators showed no interest, some influential figures upstairs began bidding.

Mutated spiritual fruits were still rare, and for clans and sects, they represented strategic long-term investments—purchases that could be reimbursed by their organizations anyway. It wasn't for personal use, but future generations could benefit.

"700 spirit stones."

"800 spirit stones."

"900."

...

"1,000 spirit stones!"

The bidding stopped there. Crossing the thousand-spirit-stone threshold seemed to be an unspoken limit among bidders.

Lin Shan exhaled in relief. He wasn't greedy—a thousand spirit stones was already an unimaginable fortune to him. His mind began wandering to how he'd spend this windfall after the auction.

...

As the auction reached its climax, the crowd grew rowdier when the final treasures were unveiled. Lin Shan craned his neck in anticipation.

"Next, we present the highlight items of today's auction."

"Five hundred years ago, a sect called the Joyous Sect in the Great Song territory was mysteriously wiped out overnight! Their ruins have recently been discovered in Jiangdong, and all items today originate from that site."

As Elder Zhang's voice rang out again, listing the treasures, Lin Shan's heart skipped a beat when he heard one particular item.

"Golden Core dual cultivation technique—Spring Wind and Rain Method. Starting bid: 10,000 spirit stones.

Damaged magic treasure—Thousand Banner Pennant. Starting bid: 20,000 spirit stones.

Damaged magic treasure—Lion Head Staff. Starting bid: 20,000 spirit stones.

Magic Pill—Polaris Nirvana Pill. Starting bid: 20,000 spirit stones.

Treasure Pill—Vigorous Dragon and Tiger Pill. Starting bid: 5,000 spirit stones.

Statue of the Joyous Buddha. Starting bid: 1,000 spirit stones!"

Statue of the Joyous Buddha!

Lin Shan froze upon hearing this.

The rest of the items went in one ear and out the other—he couldn't afford them anyway.

But a Buddha statue! Anything related to faith and destiny must contain ancient essence!

Lin Shan had encountered the Black Lotus Buddha statue before, though it only held a trace of ancient essence. As for the massive Black Lotus Buddha statue from the ancient Ye Lang tomb in Zangke County, he'd heard it was purchased by a noble from the capital. He'd asked the Nightingales to investigate during his time in the capital, but would have to wait three months for results.

He dared not touch the golden Buddha statues in ordinary temples. After all, the Buddha himself was still very much alive in the immortal realm and had once crossed dimensions to warn Lin Shan against meddling. He knew better than to provoke that.

But this Joyous Buddha statue was different—the Joyous Sect had been annihilated, making this an ownerless treasure. Wasn't this a golden opportunity?

Lin Shan's heart pounded as he debated before finally ringing the service bell.

Soon, a receptionist—a late-stage Qi Condensation female cultivator—arrived at his box.

She immediately recognized him. After Elder Zhang's high-profile endorsement yesterday, everyone in the auction house knew him as the prospective chief appraiser.

"Master Lin, how may I assist you?" she ventured after some hesitation.

"Please, no titles," Lin Shan said sheepishly. "I just wanted to ask—does the auction house extend credit to staff?"

The receptionist blinked at him before replying, "We don't offer credit, but employees can receive three months' salary in advance. Also, internal staff don't pay commission or fees on bids. First-time purchases under 2,000 spirit stones even qualify for a 20% discount."

Lin Shan started counting on his fingers.

The Violet Spirit Fruit auction would net him 1,000, plus three months' salary of 300—totaling 1,300. With no fees and a 20% discount, he could theoretically afford something worth 1,625 spirit stones.

Still feeling uneasy, he turned to the receptionist.

"Could you... lend me some?"

His tentative request was promptly rejected. Everyone lived paycheck to paycheck, barely affording their cave dwellings—who had spare spirit stones to lend?

Defeated, Lin Shan could only wait for the Joyous Buddha statue's turn.

The preceding highlight items sparked fierce bidding wars among powerful cultivators. The Golden Core cultivation technique sold for 20,000 spirit stones, while the two damaged magic treasures exceeded 30,000 each.

Magic treasures differed from magic tools—they were artifacts only Golden Core cultivators could wield. Even damaged, they were incredibly rare and valuable. The last time Yi River Auction House sold one was twenty years ago.

Such high-level items were usually traded through barter, rarely exchanged for spirit stones. This sale was likely due to the recent excavation.

The Vigorous Dragon and Tiger Pill apparently could rejuvenate elderly men, helping them "raise the flag" once more.

When the Joyous Buddha statue finally came up, enthusiasm waned—it was the least remarkable item from the haul.

"1,000 spirit stones!"

"1,100!"

"1,200!"

...

Soon, only two voices echoed through the hall—Lin Shan's and a red-faced monk's from the Qi Condensation area below.

The monk had a round face, large ears, straight nose, square jaw, and thick beard, with walnut-sized prayer beads around his neck—his intimidating demeanor screamed "don't mess with me."

Lin Shan couldn't fathom why this monk was so fixated on the statue, bidding as if his life depended on it.

Red-faced Monk: "1,400 spirit stones!"

Lin Shan: "1,500 spirit stones!"

Red-faced Monk: "1,600 spirit stones!"

Lin Shan: "1,625 spirit stones!"

Red-faced Monk: "..."

The entire hall turned to stare at the second-floor box. While auction rules didn't specify minimum increments, the unspoken convention was 100-spirit-stone raises. Who was this brat? Didn't his elders teach him manners before letting him into a private box?

Inside the box, Lin Shan cringed, toes curling in embarrassment. In his excitement, he'd blurted out his entire budget. The odd 25-spirit-stone remainder was mortifying under the collective gaze of a thousand cultivators.

On stage, Elder Zhang wondered what the boy was playing at. Was 1,625 his limit? Should I help him out?

The red-faced monk below was momentarily stunned by Lin Shan's unconventional bid before realizing—this kid must be broke! Victory was his for the taking!

Just as he prepared to crush Lin Shan and claim the statue, Elder Zhang moved with lightning speed, hammer in hand, his words rapid as arrows:

"1,625 spirit stones going once!"

"1,625 spirit stones going twice!"

"1,625 spirit stones—sold!"

"Wait! I bid 1,700—"

*Bang!* "Congratulations to our buyer in the second-floor box for winning the Joyous Buddha statue!"

The monk nearly spat blood, his higher bid strangled in his throat. Never had he witnessed such breakneck auctioneering! Since when did the hammer fall this fast?

Rigged! This was absolutely rigged!
