# Chapter 53: Beyond the Bounds

Night had yet to fully descend, but all things were already enveloped in a dense darkness. Trees stood thick on both sides of the road, their branches reaching out haphazardly in the wailing cold wind, resembling a multitude of swaying ghost shadows.

In this profound darkness, Qin Ming decisively swung his blade. It was as if a bolt of lightning had pierced the gloom, instantly shattering the earlier oppressive atmosphere.

At that very moment, a black mist surged forward, laden with intense malice, intending to envelop both of them and swallow them into a vast shadow.

In such a moonless and starless environment, others would naturally perceive nothing. Yet, Qin Ming saw it clearly and felt the mist’s chilling cold, a bone-piercing chill that assailed him as it approached.

*Hiss!* Like a hot knife cutting through butter, the short blade, coated with mineral paint, plunged into the black mist, causing the icy coldness to boil.

"What's going on?!" Old Man Liu cried out, reacting with surprising speed. With a *swish*, he simultaneously drew his heavy-backed broadsword and followed Qin Ming, slashing into the void.

However, his broadsword entered the black mist as if hitting nothing, striking only air.

"Step back quickly!" Qin Ming shouted.

At the same time, he heard a shriek, incredibly piercing, and the black mist began to rapidly condense, actually forming a human figure.

Old Man Liu was very receptive to advice. In an instant, he withdrew his blade and decisively scurried away. He couldn't see or hear anything, completely unaware of what was happening, but relying on his instincts, he realized the situation was severe and deeply unsettling.

A man appeared within the black mist, his human outline somewhat blurry, but Qin Ming's eyesight allowed him to see clearly that it was a young man, his face contorted in immense pain. His cold, sinister eyes turned towards Qin Ming.

Qin Ming’s short blade had cut into his body. The human figure formed by the black mist was actually bleeding profusely, splattering onto the ground.

This scene caused Qin Ming's expression to change.

The young man opened his mouth and spat out a swath of black mist, which transformed into an inky black arrow. It shot towards Qin Ming's brow, cold, sinister, and imbued with bone-chilling coldness.

Qin Ming tilted his head, avoiding the arrow made of black mist. Simultaneously, he violently vibrated the Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade, causing all the attached mineral coating to peel off.

All of this happened in a flash. The black mist attacked silently, and Qin Ming counter-slashed instantly. The mysteriously formed man immediately retaliated, attempting to kill him. There was no delay in the process; they both reacted at the first possible moment.

Qin Ming sensed a great crisis, feeling that he might very well die. This unknown entity brought an inexplicable sense of oppression, allowing him to genuinely perceive the aura of death.

However, as he vibrated his blade, it quickly brought about a change. The chilling, sinister mist surging towards him, with its extremely biting aura, began to rapidly weaken.

In the darkness, a brilliant flash of blade light soared, like a blazing inferno, illuminating this stretch of forest.

The Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade in Qin Ming's hand, once it had shaken off its coating, was completely different when encountering this creature.

During this process, the young man formed by the black mist naturally retreated, wanting to escape this blade. However, as the blade light burned like a radiant flame, his figure twisted and trembled continuously.

"Stop..." he shrieked desperately, struggling to re-mist and ascend into the air, but he failed.

How could Qin Ming stop? He noticed that the "blood" the young man left on the ground dissipated with the wind, like flying ash, not real human blood.

*What exactly is this thing?*

The young man could barely believe that in such a remote place, he would casually encounter a young hunter who could possess a Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade.

He could no longer mistify. He retreated with all his might, moving with a human body, trying to break free from the restraints and get away from this dazzling blade.

Qin Ming had forged this blade but had never used it before, so he had no idea of its characteristics. Now, after striking this mysterious creature, he discovered its wondrous use.

His Heaven's Light Qi could smoothly enter this blade. If it were any other weapon, it would be impossible at his current realm.

Of course, his Heaven's Light Qi was far less lethal to this young man than the Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade itself. However, because of this, he could employ many techniques, such as the adhesive property of his own Heaven's Light Qi.

Qin Ming wielded the Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade. Amidst the steaming white light, it clung to the young man who was trying to escape, as if burning a ghost.

"No, stop!" The young man was terrified, struggling violently.

But how could Qin Ming stop? He didn't even know what kind of monster this was. If it truly escaped, he would be in danger.

The young man raised his hands and opened his mouth several times, trying to unleash black mist and attack Qin Ming, but all were incinerated by the blade light.

His entire body was engulfed in flames. It was no longer like a hot knife cutting butter; it was more like a red-hot blade falling into dry grass, setting it ablaze.

Qin Ming employed his Intercepting Force. The Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade moved crisscross within the young man's body, setting fires everywhere. And whenever the black mist churned and the young man desperately tried to break free, Qin Ming would transform his force into Silk-winding Force and Adhesive Force, firmly locking him down.

Clearly, when the Heaven's Light pierced through the night and descended upon the spiritual mountains, the mysterious products nourished by it all contained an inexplicable power.

At this moment, Qin Ming deeply realized and understood what Cao Long, Mu Qing, and others had said before.

The Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade's light steamed, utterly suppressing the mist-formed man.

In the distance, Old Man Liu's hair stood on end. He saw nothing but Qin Ming's snow-white short blade glowing, then seeming to turn into a torch.

"Why am I completely blind? I didn't see a single ghost shadow."

Qin Ming heard his words and immediately realized that the young man formed by black mist was even more terrifying than imagined. Ordinary people wouldn't even sense him. How could they fight against him?

The young man despaired, for his entire body was burning, and he couldn't break free.

"In an age without the sun, I should be very safe when traveling after reaching this level. How could I meet with disaster here..." He was in immense pain and naturally didn't want to die like this. After weighing his options, he could only abandon something.

"Are you one of those unseen, mysterious creatures that many great clans fear?" Qin Ming demanded.

"I am not one of those things! I am a human! Stop quickly and listen to me!" the young man cried out.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming swung his blade even more fiercely, employing his blade techniques within the man's body, crisscrossing, horizontal and vertical slashes, and even the Blade Intent from the blade manual!

The man formed by black mist desperately wanted to curse. Why was he targeted even more fiercely just because he said he was human?

"People like you are even more terrifying than ghosts!" Qin Ming declared.

"I am from Beyond the Bounds..." the young man shouted urgently.

He was terrified, but he didn't have time to speak, for his body was about to be completely annihilated by the fiery light emanating from the Mutton-fat Jade Blade.

Qin Ming found it absurd. His blade had cut into the man's head several times, yet the opponent was unharmed. In the end, it was only the fiery light that seemed capable of burning him to death.

*Bang!*

At the last moment, the man actually self-destructed, abandoning his dense shadowy body. A piece of tattered cloth, wrapped around a tiny bit of his essence, broke free and tried to fly into the night sky.

But he was too weak. When he activated the strange cloth, his speed was much slower than usual.

Qin Ming reacted swiftly, slashing it with his blade and bringing it down.

"Hmm?" He found that the palm-sized piece of cloth was unharmed. Although it had fallen, it still contained a ball of black mist and tried to soar again.

Qin Ming used the Adhesive Force of his Heaven's Light Qi to reel it back. Then, he activated the Nail Force, piercing the blade's edge through the unsealed gaps in the cloth.

"Ah, stop! I'm from Beyond the Bounds..." the young man cried out, but it changed nothing. The last of the shadowy mist was burned away.

The palm-sized piece of cloth floated to the ground, and the mist-formed young man seemed to have never existed.

Qin Ming gripped the Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade, his expression solemn. He had guessed the young man's background—likely one of the so-called "Beyond the Bounds" individuals.

This was different from what he had imagined. The opponent was not some invisible, mysterious "thing," but a real human being, though his state was extremely peculiar.

"Are people from Beyond the Bounds really this difficult to deal with?" Qin Ming's heart felt heavy.

This person could actually fly, and ordinary people couldn't even see him. How could one possibly fight against that?

Old Man Liu had struck this person with his heavy-backed broadsword, but it was like cutting through air, completely ineffective.

Qin Ming stood still, his expression more serious than ever, because one of his opponents was also from Beyond the Bounds.

If that 羽衣少年 (feathered-robe youth) who led people to burn down the entire village that night, so ethereal and aloof, also walked this path, then he would surely possess these abilities in the future, perhaps even stronger, far surpassing the dead young man.

Earlier, Qin Ming had rejoiced in his rapid growth, feeling he had achieved extraordinary accomplishments in a short time. But now, cold wind carried snowflakes, striking his face, and he sobered up. He couldn't be complacent; he needed to become even stronger.

Because the powerful force he would face in the future was truly somewhat mysterious and unfathomable.

Qin Ming thought about why the silk book appeared. It was because several elders felt that their chosen paths had many shortcomings and jointly deduced new methods, hoping to rival the most glorious paths.

"The methods of those from Beyond the Bounds are truly mysterious and terrifying!" Qin Ming murmured to himself. His own path was still long, and he needed to climb higher, one step at a time.

"Is it resolved? What kind of monster was that? This old man was like a blind fool, couldn't even see a ghost!" Old Man Liu walked over, holding his broadsword.

"Someone from Beyond the Bounds," Qin Ming informed him.

"Their background... is certainly not small!" Old Man Liu's expression grew serious. They had actually provoked such a person.

Qin Ming used the Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade to lift the piece of cloth. He activated his Heaven's Light Qi, making the blade glow brightly, but the cloth showed no reaction.

Old Man Liu's heart surged with emotion. He felt that young Qin was somewhat unfamiliar now, having forged such a strange blade and even killed an unseen individual from Beyond the Bounds.

However, he was old, having guarded Black and White Mountain for so many years, and had heard of too many anomalous events. His emotions quickly settled.

Qin Ming carefully examined the cloth on the blade. He could tell it was extraordinary, with metallic threads woven into it, embroidered with cloud patterns. There should have been other patterns too, but the piece of cloth was too small to discern the main design.

"Should we head back to the village first?" Old Man Liu asked.

Qin Ming shook his head and said, "Let's go to Silver Vine Town instead. We'll have an early breakfast, then go to the family we agreed to meet."

Old Man Liu asked, "You don't need to go back and rest for a bit? Are you that unfazed?"

Qin Ming shook his head again. "There's no need to rest. Those unknowns and mysteries are currently not understood because my strength is still insufficient. Going to borrow secret texts now is a way to improve myself, truly setting out on my path."
