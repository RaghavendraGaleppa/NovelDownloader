# Chapter 10: Trust

"To be precise, this jade token can exempt one from the two-year labor service at the Ascension Pavilion."

So that's how it is. The Ascension Pavilion really is no good. Jiang Li silently cursed inwardly but remained silent, listening as Yan Hong continued his explanation.

"Fu Zhong told me that the Ascension Assembly also has an age limit—participants must be under sixteen."

"Every year during recruitment, the children brought back by the Ascension Pavilion's agents are usually around thirteen to fourteen years old."

"If the forces behind these children don't pay the price or lack the means to obtain such jade tokens, they'll be forced to serve two years of menial labor at the Ascension Pavilion before being allowed to participate in the Ascension Assembly."

"For disciples with mid-grade or higher spiritual roots, the Pavilion wouldn't dare deceive other sects like this. They fear these individuals might grow powerful and seek revenge later. So these jade tokens make no difference to people like us."

"But for those with low-grade or inferior spiritual roots, who lack family backing and can't even afford a single jade token—no one cares much about them. They'll waste two years in various places arranged by the Ascension Pavilion."

"Some will be indoctrinated and directly choose to join the Ascension Pavilion, continuing to serve the organization. Others will have their spirits broken during those two years of servitude, developing submissive natures that make them easier to manage and exploit when they eventually join other sects."

"Accepting mortal gold and silver further consolidates the Ascension Pavilion's control over the mortal world of the Great Chong Mountains. Low-grade spiritual root cultivators tempered by two years of hardship become more obedient and easier to control. This arrangement benefits both the other sects and the Ascension Pavilion, which is why this practice has persisted."

Pausing for a moment, Yan Hong looked at Jiang Li with utmost seriousness.

"Brother, I have an idea, and I need your help!"

Jiang Li laughed heartily and straightforwardly reached into his robe, pulling out a cloth pouch which he placed in Yan Hong's hand. Inside were three Ascension Pavilion jade tokens and eight spirit stones.

Jiang Li trusted Yan Hong. Just for that jar of pear blossom ointment Yan Hong had brought him in his time of need, even if Yan Hong kept all eight spirit stones for himself, Jiang Li wouldn't say a word. At worst, their bond would simply end there.

But if Yan Hong proved trustworthy, it would deepen the mutual trust between them—something immensely valuable. After all, even in games people form parties to level up together. If immortality could truly be achieved alone, would there even be a cultivation world? Wouldn't everyone just meditate in seclusion?

Thus Jiang Li also needed friends. And friends made during one's mortal days, like brothers from school days in a past life, were the most genuine and trustworthy.

So Jiang Li handed over the spirit stones without hesitation.

"You want to take a group of laborers and form your own faction, right? As long as we can ensure their loyalty, I'm in."

"Don't be fooled by how many people are gathered around those guys over there. Very few of them are actually reliable."

Jiang Li gestured toward the four lively groups chatting and laughing nearby. If he and Yan Hong sat at an empty table, they'd likely attract just as many followers—but what would be the point?

Consider this: during the upcoming Ascension Assembly, would those followers abandon the sects best suited for them just because of faction loyalty? Impossible.

"Heh, I knew you'd understand."

"I've already inquired—there's a type of contract in the cultivation world that's unbreakable once signed. The cheapest kind costs only five spirit stones per copy."

"Moreover, in many major sects, outer disciples receive monthly cultivation stipends for their first few years. Even the lowest inferior spiritual root disciples get one spirit stone per month."

"At that point, just collecting these stipends could earn us dozens of times our investment! Consider this your stake, brother. Any profits will be split fifty-fifty!"

Yan Hong grew increasingly excited as he spoke, pulling out his own savings—two spirit stones and one jade token. Combined with Jiang Li's contribution, they now had ten spirit stones and three jade tokens.

On paper, a fifty-fifty split seemed unfair to Jiang Li. But in reality, Yan Hong would handle all subsequent operations, making Jiang Li the one benefiting effortlessly.

After some calculations, Yan Hong took four spirit stones from the pile and gave Jiang Li a "watch this" look.

Picking up a cup of strong liquor from a nearby table, he cheerfully approached the four tables where factions were already forming.

He toasted and joked generously, showering the other youths with flattery they'd never heard before. Cup after cup, he soon had most of them laughing and chatting like old friends.

Jiang Li seemed to see in him the shadow of top salespeople from his past life's business dinners, his round face oddly reminiscent of Steward Fu Zhong.

"Sometimes I wonder—are you here to cultivate immortality, or to make money in the cultivation world?"

After a while, Yan Hong returned with a flushed, smiling face, clutching a bulging pouch—clearly a successful haul.

"Haha, you've got it all wrong, brother. What's bad about making money? Who says you can't cultivate while getting rich? Scholars may be poor, but martial artists need wealth—and cultivating immortality burns through spirit stones even faster! I just think only with enough spirit stones can one truly cultivate to the end!"

"But rest assured, brother—you saved my life!"

Yan Hong was referring to the scale demon incident. Perhaps the alcohol from his toasts had gone to his head, as he suddenly grew emotional.

"Don't... don't say you were just repaying me. Helping you was nothing. That's why you trust me."

He patted the pouch containing spirit stones and jade tokens, deeply moved by Jiang Li's trust.

"But when you saved me, you nearly died doing it."

His hand rested on Jiang Li's left shoulder, as if he could still feel the scars beneath the clothing. The horror of that attack had clearly affected him deeply.

"If you hadn't come, brother, I'd have had my guts ripped out and eaten by those damned scale demons long ago!"

"Yan Hong gives you his word today—no matter how much I earn in the future, half of it is yours!"

With that, he raised another cup toward Jiang Li.

Yan Hong was indeed clever, but at thirteen or fourteen years old—equivalent to early teens in Jiang Li's past life—he was at the age most prone to impulsiveness and romanticizing brotherly bonds.

"Unable to repay the debt of saving my life"—wasn't that phrase the epitome of this era's values?

Jiang Li smiled and raised his own cup. They clinked glasses and drank.

"In that case, I won't stand on ceremony."

"Damn! Couldn't you at least pretend to decline?"

They both laughed. Yan Hong stuffed the pouch into his robes and hurried off to find Fu Zhong.

In their caravan, the spiritual root tests had identified nineteen mid-grade and five high-grade spiritual roots—meaning these twenty-four didn't actually need the Ascension Pavilion tokens.

Excluding Jiang Li, Yan Hong, and seven commoners without tokens, Yan Hong acquired the remaining fifteen tokens in exchange for four spirit stones.

Of course, those four spirit stones only went to the four high-grade spiritual root candidates.

As a high-grade spiritual root holder himself who'd offered spirit stones, and since the extra tokens were useless to them anyway, the others couldn't refuse Yan Hong's small request—it was only proper to help out, wasn't it?
