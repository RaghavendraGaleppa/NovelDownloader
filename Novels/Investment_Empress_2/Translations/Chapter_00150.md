# Chapter 150: The Scenery of That Smile (1/2)

“Not bad... actually pretty good?”

Shang Wu blinked and patted Li Mo’s shoulder.

She didn’t know much about art, but at a glance, it really was excellent.

“It is good.”

Ying Bing nodded gently, a hint of surprise in her eyes.

Even without the facial features drawn, she could tell it was her.

This meant the artist’s grasp of artistic conception and charm had reached a profound level, possessing a spiritual resonance.

“A trivial skill, nothing to write home about.”

Li Mo curled his lips.

He wasn’t being modest; he just had a clear understanding of his limits.

This level of skill was the result of sixty years of dedication!

However.

Seeing Ying Bing’s gaze linger on the painting for a long time, her expression slightly dazed, Little Li’s heart suddenly didn’t ache as much anymore.

“Why didn’t you draw the face?”

Shang Wu pointed at the blank face of the girl in the painting.

Li Mo said helplessly:

“It’s my first time drawing a portrait. I wanted to capture a smiling expression.”

“Besides, the composition of this painting is set in the brilliant midsummer. If the figure isn’t smiling, it would ruin the overall artistic conception.”

“It’s just a smile...”

Shang Wu stopped mid-sentence as she remembered.

She actually couldn’t recall ever seeing Ying Bing smile.

Li Mo couldn’t quite remember either.

In his memory, it was extremely rare to see Ying Bing reveal a smile. The number of times was as rare as the sun rising from the west.

Forget about seeing her smile.

He couldn’t even imagine what the Ice Cube would look like when she smiled.

“Xiao Bing’er, why don’t you... try smiling?” Shang Wu coaxed.

Ying Bing frowned slightly, lowered her eyes, and pondered for a moment, looking somewhat troubled.

However.

She owed Li Mo another favor.

Since she had promised to be his model until the painting was finished, she had no choice but to...

Ying Bing pulled at her petal-like lips, narrowed her eyes slightly, and tried to force a smile onto her cold, beautiful face.

“Hehe...”

Was it beautiful?

It was beautiful.

But...

“Gulp...”

Li Mo and Shang Wu both leaned back slightly, feeling a chill run down their spines.

This was a smile, but it was clearly a cold sneer!

It was aloof and heartless, like the bright moon looking down upon mortals, silently saying two words:

“Ants.”

If he painted it like this, the painting would definitely be rated R.

Minors would get traumatized just looking at it.

“What to do...”

Li Mo pondered for a moment, then suddenly crossed his eyes (refer to the profile picture of the little flop author) and made a face.

“Pfft... Hahaha, you look so silly.”

Shang Wu hugged her stomach, laughing so hard her body swayed.

“?”

Ying Bing’s frown deepened, not understanding this confusing behavior.

Li Mo helplessly returned his expression to normal and said seriously:

“It seems it’s time for the King of Jokes to make his appearance!”

“I will definitely make you laugh today!”

The Funny Challenge at the Autumn Water Pavilion begins!

First up is our beautiful Master, contestant Shang Wu.

She had a serious expression and great ambition, vowing to make the Ice Cube laugh!

She started with a deadpan look.

“There was a little butterfly, flying along, when suddenly she was so hungry she couldn’t fly... Hahaha... And then... And then.”

She hadn’t even finished the joke.

She was already laughing so hard she could barely breathe.

“Then... she fell into the mud and was drowned by the mud, hahaha...”

Shang Wu hugged her stomach, laughing until she was out of breath.

“?”

Li Mo and Ying Bing exchanged a glance.

Was that funny?

Where was the funny part?

“So, Master, where is the punchline?” Li Mo asked.

“Starved to death, the mud butterfly (sounds like ‘starved to death, the mud butterfly’ in Shaanxi dialect)”

---

Shang Wu wiped her tears as she explained.

Li Mo: “....”

What a terrible pun.

Since contestant Shang Wu used a pun and lost points, Judge Little Li and Judge Ice Cube unanimously decided to disqualify her.

Fine.

The main reason was that Master had the sense of humor of a pile of dung. Even if the joke was long, she would laugh herself to death before finishing it.

Next, contestant number two, Little Li!

Li Mo decided to use his ultimate trump card:

“There was a person whose farts were incredibly loud. Can you guess why?”

“Why?”

Shang Wu asked.

“Because he was wearing bell-bottoms.”

“Hahahaha...”

“Hmm?”

Ying Bing tilted her head, looking at the laughing Shang Wu who was doubled over, not quite understanding.

Was that... funny?

“Not even a chuckle?”

Little Li’s competitive spirit flared.

He refused to believe this!

...

Half an hour later.

Little Li looked full of doubt about his life.

The beautiful Master was almost laughing her abs out, saying she couldn’t take it anymore.

But the number of question marks over the Ice Cube’s head only increased.

Li Mo was parched and had lost all confidence.

He deeply suspected that the Ice Cube simply didn’t have a sense of humor.

“I’m so stupid, really.”

“Sigh, give up. Xiao Bing’er might just be born without a love for laughter. My dear disciple, your jokes were really amazing.”

Shang Wu caught her breath and shook her head.

“Sigh, how can we make her laugh?”

Li Mo wracked his brains, using his brush to poke the corner of his mouth.

Perhaps because he was thinking about jokes too seriously.

He didn’t notice that he was holding the brush upside down. The end dipped in ink left a few streaks on his handsome face.

“Pfft...”

“Master, don’t laugh at me.”

Li Mo wiped the corner of his mouth annoyed, but the ink smudged, making his face look like a black cat sheriff.

“It wasn’t me.”

Shang Wu shook her head in confusion.

Oh, right.

The light laugh came again, but Master was clearly talking to him.

“Hmm?”

Li Mo froze and turned his head.

The setting sun still had a trace of afterglow, struggling not to sink in the west.

This afterglow happened to fall on the girl, making her ice-mirror-like eyes flicker between light and shadow.

The gentle evening breeze lifted her hair, blurring her features, but the slightly raised corner of her mouth.

But the rookie painter reflected in her eyes was so clear.

Li Mo suddenly felt as if he couldn't perceive the passage of time, as if time had stopped.

A masterpiece was right before his eyes.

“What are you drawing? Spaced out?”

Shang Wu patted his shoulder.

“Ah, ah.”

Li Mo quickly snapped back to reality.

He focused his mind, lifted his brush, and added a touch of pure, enchanting smile to the blank face of the girl on the scroll.

For some reason.

As these few strokes fell, he felt his mind suddenly clear, exhaustion surging into his heart.

“Is it done? Is it done?”

Shang Wu stuck her head over.

“This... is me?”

Ying Bing also stared intently.

The girl in the painting made her feel both familiar and unfamiliar.

Because even she couldn’t remember what she looked like when she smiled.

However.

In Li Mo’s brush, a few strokes captured the spirit perfectly.

The coldness and the brightness were perfectly blended together by those few strokes.

This smile seemed eternal, vivid, as if another her was quietly standing right there.

She looked at it under the moonlight, and an indescribable emotion spread in her heart.

*Rustle—*

The evening breeze blew, and the leaves rustled as they were swept by the wind.
