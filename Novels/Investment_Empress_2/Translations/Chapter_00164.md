Chapter 164: Rewarding You for Hitting His Hand with Your Butt

The moment the General Principle appeared in his mind, Li Mo froze on the spot.

He felt as if he were standing in a graveyard of weapons.

Sabers, spears, swords, halberds—every kind of weapon was present. Though they were all ordinary weapons, the lingering intent on some of the blades was so sharp that even he felt a chill in his heart.

A man in coarse linen clothes sat silently among them. His face was indistinct, and the space around him was densely covered in sword marks.

The fluctuation of the Heaven and Earth Origin Energy around this man was incredibly faint.

He looked up at the sky, as if sensing something.

*Hum—*

A wooden sword appeared in his hand, causing the countless weapons in the Sword Tomb to cry out in unison. They swam through the void like schooling fish.

He swung his sword toward the heavens. From his withered body erupted a supreme Sword Intent, as if drawing a world-shaking divine sword from a plain, unremarkable scabbard.

One sword seemed to turn into nine, then ten thousand, and then it was no longer just a sword.

The void shattered.

Li Mo felt his spirit tremble violently, as if pulled by an invisible force.

That glint of cold light seemed to pierce through endless time and space, striking him from afar.

There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to evade. Every possible variation was contained within it.

Vaguely, the General Principle flowed through Li Mo’s heart.

*‘Returning Maiden tends to No妄 (Wu Wang), No妄 tends to Fellow Man, Fellow Man tends to Great Possession, Jia turns to Bing, Bing turns to Geng...’*

“Haa...”

Li Mo’s head ached.

The System had displayed the True Meaning in a very gentle way, yet it still put a huge strain on his spirit. If he hadn’t reached the Divine Observation Realm, he would have lost consciousness just like when he accepted the *Karma Fire Red Lotus Mystical Method*.

The *Solitary Nine Swords* exhausted the principles of change.

Its mystery and profundity could no longer be called a sword technique; it was a type of ‘logic’ or ‘reason,’ merely expressed through the medium of a sword.

It was no wonder it had no rank. The martial arts evaluation system of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands could not judge it.

“I wonder if my Martial Dao Insight is enough to burn...”

Li Mo was genuinely uncertain this time.

Bearing seven hundred and eighty years of Martial Dao Insight, he actually felt a bit poor...

But.

For Little Li, who dreamed of being a swordsman, the *Solitary Nine Swords* was a dream true treasure.

However, the biggest difficulty of this martial art was a single word.

*‘Enlightenment!’*

Since it was right in front of him, he couldn't just stare at it.

“Ice Cube, are you awake?”

Every time Li Mo practiced swordplay with the Ice Cube, he saved a lot of Martial Dao Insight.

***

In the next room.

Sitting on the Cold Marrow Jade Bed, Ying Bing sat cross-legged, continuously using the Yin Energy to refine her soul.

Inside the acupoint she had just opened, a crystal-like figure was shining brightly.

As the Yin energy circulated and she continued to observe it, the divine patterns on the little figure showed signs of taking shape.

Besides the Yin Divine Patterns, there were also a few traces resembling birds, which were born and extinguished with the flow of Origin Energy.

This process had continued the entire night.

A moment later, Ying Bing opened her eyes. Just as she was about to get up, she saw illusory words floating before her eyes.

[You have a Tier D Low-Rank Reward waiting to be claimed.]

Ying Bing prepared to ignore it.

After all, based on the last experience, she didn't want to go through that again...

Suddenly.

[You! Have! A! Tier! D! Low! Rank! Reward! Waiting! To! Be! Claimed!!!!!!]

The System’s text, afraid she wouldn't see it, suddenly enlarged ten times.

Ying Bing: “.....I don’t need it.”

[Detected the phrase ‘need it’ in the Host’s response.]

[Reward being issued...]

Ying Bing became even more certain that the System’s rewards were definitely not good things.

Fine, just let it issue the reward.

No matter what it is this time, she would just ignore it completely.

[This Tier D Low-Rank Reward is:

Rewarding you for hitting Li Mo’s hand with your butt.]

Ying Bing: “?”

Seeing this so-called ‘reward,’ the corners of her beautiful phoenix eyes twitched.

You call this... a reward?

The cold, noble, and majestic Empress of the Phoenix Heaven couldn't hold her composure anymore.

If the System had a physical form, she would have already sliced it into pieces with her sword!

“If I don’t do it, this reward doesn’t exist.”

Ying Bing’s eyebrows smoothed out.

She had completely lost interest in the System’s evaluation rewards.

Because all of them were indecent!

---

The ranking rewards were enough.

Just then.

*Knock, knock—* The door was knocked.

“Ice Cube, are you awake?”

“Get up and practice the sword.”

Li Mo’s voice came from outside.

Right.

After obtaining the *Divine Sky Heart Sword Canon*, she hadn't practiced it yet.

Yes, let's go practice the sword!

Ying Bing forgot about the inexplicable System reward, her eyes returning to calmness. She took the Sky Frost sword and opened the door.

As the door opened, their eyes met.

That face, bathed in the morning light, handsome and bright, was smiling.

After he entered the Divine Observation Realm... his aura seemed to have changed slightly?

It had to be said.

Li Mo was born exceptionally well, combining the best features of his father and mother. Especially when he smiled, it easily made people feel warm.

If she were to hit him...

Wait.

Ying Bing froze for a moment in a daze.

What had just popped into her mind?

Li Mo was completely unaware, asking, “Today, uh... are you feeling a bit better?”

That ‘relative’ definitely hadn't left yet.

Some girls have severe reactions, suffering from excruciating pain.

“Huh? Yeah...”

Ying Bing subconsciously nodded.

What does ‘feeling better’ even mean?

Anyway, she wasn't feeling too comfortable right now...

Because that strange sensation didn't seem to be limited to her psychology.

It was itchy.

It felt like a little ant was crawling down her tailbone...

This must be the doing of that so-called reward!

“Since you’re better, let’s go eat breakfast first.”

“We can practice the sword after eating.”

Li Mo never imagined that the Ice Cube was being dishonest. He turned around and went downstairs.

It wasn't until breakfast that he noticed something was off.

“The Master is sleeping in again.”

In the courtyard, Li Mo scratched his chin and sat down with the freshly steamed buns.

He had just taken a bite when he noticed Ying Bing was still standing.

“Sit down and eat.”

Li Mo felt it was strange.

With the Ice Cube’s aura, standing there made him feel like he was sitting on pins and needles.

Actually....

Ying Bing was the one sitting on pins and needles.

She remembered that the moment she sat down, the sensation became even more intense.

“No, I’m fine standing.”

“Are you really okay?”

Seeing Ying Bing’s body tense and her neck flushed red, Li Mo frowned and asked.

“I... can do it!”

Ying Bing took a light breath, her slender hand gripping the sword hilt.

Her eyes behind the ice mirror became firm again.

If she cleared her mind of distractions, what was this... to her?

She had endured even more painful and difficult things!

When she was forging her Law Body, it seemed she angered the heavens. Heavenly tribulation descended, like a doomsday scenario, trying to obliterate her into nothingness.

She endured that kind of pain!

Only because of her unyielding heart!

“Come.”

Ying Bing drew the Sky Frost, the blade gleaming with snow.

Her black hair flew, but it could not cover the light in her eyes!

Li Mo scratched his head.

Why did the Ice Cube suddenly have such an overflowing competitive spirit?

When they sparred in swordsmanship, he usually listened to her teachings more often than not.

Mmmmmmm.

Maybe she wants to test if I’ve made any progress.

“I shall go all out!”

Little Li stood up, biting into his bun.

Bearing the *Solitary Nine Swords* (even though he hadn't mastered it yet).

He had to show the Ice Cube a thing or two!
