**Chapter 95: Slaying a Saint**

The night fog surged. Qin Ming never expected that he would "fall off his mount." His smile vanished, his expression completely frozen.

Below, the golden-armored guard grinned, revealing a mouthful of pearly white teeth. It seemed all of Qin Ming's lost amusement had transferred to him, his smile growing increasingly brilliant.

"Haha..." He swung his greatsword, crushing the sandy ground beneath his feet. His entire body radiated Heavenly Radiance, like a rapidly streaking meteor, threatening to shatter mountains!

Clearly, he wished he could cleave the young man in two with a single strike, making him lose an arm even before contact.

He leaped up, his golden armor clanging, golden light shining in all directions. He was like a blazing sun, intending to burn away the dark night fog. The greatsword in his hand cut through the air like a bolt of lightning.

With a *thwip*, the black fierce bird was bisected by his strike. The Heavenly Radiance tore through its flesh, and blood-stained feathers drifted down.

Qin Ming had already leaped off the bird's back in advance, spreading his clothes like bat wings. This was in imitation of Ge Qianxun, and though he was already close to the ground, he still used it. At the very least, his glide was astonishingly fast, leaving the Outer Saint on the ground momentarily stunned. The guard had to sprint furiously again to pursue him.

With a *thud*, Qin Ming crashed into the soft yellow sand, creating a large pit. Dust billowed up. Protected by Heavenly Radiance, he wasn't injured in the slightest.

"Try running again!" The golden-armored guard appeared, his expression cold. Not much was left of his right arm, which had been utterly smashed by the black-gold great hammer. The shattered bones and bloody pulp couldn't be reattached. Thus, he harbored immense hatred for the young man before him.

Qin Ming's expression grew exceptionally solemn. Facing an Outer Saint alone, his heart truly pounded. If any other newcomer stood here, they would have long since despaired. How could one possibly fight back?

The golden-armored guard, holding his greatsword in his left hand, slowly approached, radiating an intense oppressive aura. He wasn't old, a young man in his twenties with sharp features and piercing eyes.

*Boom!*

He stomped his foot with immense force, instantly sending sand swirling everywhere. He appeared before Qin Ming, raising his sword and chopping down. Qin Ming didn't meet it head-on, swiftly evading the strike.

The golden-armored guard's sword cut through empty air. He half-spun his body, swinging his leg in a sweeping kick towards the young man in the sand. This force was enough to send an elephant flying, its belly ripped open and intestines spilling out.

Qin Ming fumbled, seemingly flustered. He didn't even have time to remove his scabbard, directly using it to block the young man's left leg, which emanated Heavenly Radiance.

A chilling smile appeared at the golden-armored guard's lips. *Such a weakling...* No, he shivered, suddenly realizing. It was precisely this "weakling" who had killed the woman in black and had also caused him to permanently lose his right arm not long before. He was indeed an Outer Saint; even though his leg had already swung out, he forcibly retracted it at the last moment, instead sweeping with his golden greatsword.

Dazzling light burst from Qin Ming's hand. His scabbard shattered as the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade clashed with the greatsword. Sparks flew, and the clanging sound was incredibly harsh. The golden-armored guard broke out in a cold sweat. He quickly retreated a few steps, calming his mind. It had been truly too perilous. If he hadn't retracted his leg just now, today would have ended in tragedy!

Qin Ming was incredibly regretful. He was just a hair's breadth away from severing his opponent's leg with his treasured blade. Success and failure truly hung on an instant. He realized that his "Heavenly Flying Hammer" strike had left a psychological shadow on the golden-armored guard, making the opponent exceptionally vigilant.

Qin Ming felt a dull ache in his chest, continuously forced back by the vibrations. His hands, gripping the blade, felt numb, and the blood in his body churned violently. He finally understood the taste of brute force overpowering skill, of being violently struck head-on.

The golden-armored man glanced at the notch on his greatsword, his expression grim. He became twelve times more cautious of this young man, who was still in the newcomer stage. He had to be careful. After the opponent had smashed his arm, he had set his sights on his left leg, and almost succeeded! Then, his eyes grew hot again. The young man was holding a Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade! He wanted to claim this war trophy.

Neither spoke. All words were pale; at this moment, they only wanted to kill each other. A fierce wind whipped up. The night fog was like a burst dam, sweeping vast amounts of yellow sand from the ground into the air. Both men made their move.

With a *clang*, Qin Ming was sent reeling back six or seven meters, nearly stumbling to the ground. His hands ached terribly from the impact, and the web between his thumb and forefinger bled slightly.

The golden-armored youth strode forward, his expression icy. Another terrible notch appeared on his greatsword. What he found unbearable was that he couldn't cleave the opponent with one sword strike, nor could he even shake the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade from the opponent's grip.

Qin Ming flexed his wrists in the sand, a strange expression on his face. Had this young man just entered the Outer Saint realm not long ago? The gap between them didn't seem to be that vast. At the very least, he had already withstood two of his opponent's sword strikes!

"Did you undergo seven rebirths before entering the Outer Saint realm?" Qin Ming asked, pointing his Mutton-Fat Jade Blade forward with both hands.

Upon hearing this, the golden-armored youth's eyes shot out a cold gleam. Did this young man think he wasn't strong enough? This must be mockery. He instantly charged forward, swinging his greatsword repeatedly.

Qin Ming wasn't mocking him; he just wanted to confirm one thing: how big was the gap between himself and an Outer Saint? Now, by testing it himself, he had initially verified that in terms of strength, the opponent did not possess an absolute overwhelming advantage over him.

The two exchanged blows rapidly. Qin Ming was repeatedly sent flying, and although his steps faltered, he eventually stabilized. The soft flesh between his fingers was slightly damaged, and trickles of blood seeped out, but he could still persevere. Most crucially, he had built up confidence. The opponent was still far from possessing strength over ten thousand catties and couldn't simply hack him to death with terrifying brute force.

In an instant, Qin Ming became proactive, seizing the initiative multiple times. His blade intent was astonishing, and he exuded an aura of self-confidence, like a young master of the blade. The golden-armored man's mind trembled. He was obsessed with sword practice and had achieved profound mastery, but compared to the young man's blade techniques before him, his own truly amounted to nothing. In the end, he was forced to rely on brute force to make his opponent engage in a blade-to-blade clash. His sword techniques were far inferior to the young man's, leaving him furious and embarrassed. What kind of monster had he encountered?

The golden-armored man had high standards. He saw the aura of a grandmaster of blade arts in Qin Ming; calling him a young master of the blade was not an exaggeration.

In the desert, countless grains of yellow sand rose, dancing with Qin Ming's Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade. Driven by his blade intent, they churned like waves, one after another. The desert in this area seemed to transform into a furious sea. As the battle progressed, crashing waves and towering sand-billows surged skyward, growing increasingly terrifying. This was a kind of near-domain power, generated by a young master of the blade giving his all.

The golden-armored man had to unleash his power, pushing his Heavenly Radiance Energy to its limit. He disrupted Qin Ming's unique rhythm, shaking him so hard that Qin Ming nearly vomited a large mouthful of blood. The golden-armored man himself was not well. Once he fully unleashed his Heavenly Radiance Energy, blood would gush from his severed arm, and he couldn't control the wound.

Qin Ming coughed up blood, wobbling as he stood up. He chuckled, "An Outer Saint's Heavenly Radiance Energy isn't as strong as I imagined either. I can withstand it!" His battle intent soared, directly radiating intense confidence.

"Are you insulting me?" The golden-armored youth's voice was chilling, his sword-wielding hand trembling. A young newcomer actually faced him with such an attitude.

Qin Ming said, "Am I wrong? It seems that if one only underwent seven rebirths and used potent elixirs to break into the Outer Saint realm, the improvement in physical quality and the boost to Heavenly Radiance are far less potent than I imagined. Hmm, I've already killed seven or eight Golden Robbers who underwent seven rebirths." In Qin Ming's eyes, this golden-armored man was just someone who had consumed one more potent elixir than a few older Golden Robbers, barely allowing his Heavenly Radiance to be released outwards.

"Outer Saint, come, let's fight to the death!" he roared.

The golden-armored youth felt Qin Ming was taking advantage of him, calling him a nephew. At this moment, he no longer considered this young man an opponent from the newcomer stage, nor even human. The opponent wielded a mysterious and terrifying Heavenly Radiance Energy, actually capable of withstanding an Outer Saint like him, and possessing hints of a blade grandmaster's essence. He truly was a monster.

"Kill!"

The two fought a desperate battle, staking their lives on it. Qin Ming completely disregarded his profusely bleeding hands, only knowing to continuously swing his blade, attacking with superb and unfathomable blade techniques, carrying a terrifying blade intent. Furthermore, he would occasionally make physical contact with his opponent, clashing with his Heavenly Radiance Energy.

"Is that Earth Essence Qi?" The golden-armored man was alarmed. The young man's palms carried Earth Essence Qi. Wasn't that a method only Outer Saints could master? He himself hadn't even tried it after stepping into the Outer Saint realm!

Qin Ming's Yellow Mud Palm struck out repeatedly, making the golden-armored man extremely uncomfortable, blood already trickling from the corner of his mouth. Undoubtedly, Qin Ming's combat power was strongest when he merged all his Heavenly Radiance Energy and unleashed it violently, but the consumption was truly too great. Currently, he chose the Yellow Mud Palm because its consumption wasn't as high, especially after absorbing that miraculous stone condensed from Earth Vein Essence Qi. The power of this palm technique was terrifying.

Whenever the golden-armored man intended a desperate clash, Qin Ming would also switch to his integrated Heavenly Radiance Energy, erupting with full power, clashing head-on with the opponent to the very end. He could anticipate when his opponent would use his full power, because whenever the golden-armored man fought desperately, blood would gush from his severed arm.

The golden-armored man had never felt so stifled. He was actually fighting to this extent with a young man in the newcomer stage. This was an incredibly uncomfortable battle for him. Theoretically, as an Outer Saint, he could have cleaved the opponent in two with a single sword strike, capable of instantly tearing the young man's entire body apart with Heavenly Radiance Energy. But now, his greatsword couldn't cut through the young man, and his palm couldn't penetrate the opponent's strange Heavenly Radiance Energy. He felt at a loss, and he himself was already covered in wounds.

At this moment, the golden-armored man's face was ashen. After multiple full-strength desperate clashes, he didn't know how much vital blood had gushed from his severed arm. He realized things were going badly. This young man, gritting his teeth, had persevered until now and seemed to be gradually gaining the upper hand.

"He might really possess a fragmented Tathagata Force or Sky-Propping Force. He's been dragging me into this desperate fight until now, and I'm losing too much blood. I can't hold on much longer."

With a *clang*, the greatsword in the golden-armored man's hand completely snapped into two. If it hadn't been filled with his Heavenly Radiance, it would have been shattered by the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade long ago.

"This..." The golden-armored man began to retreat. As an Outer Saint, he was actually panicking and somewhat afraid to fight.

"Kill!" Qin Ming, despite coughing blood, still charged forward with his blade. His Heavenly Radiance Energy surged around him, maintaining an unparalleled, vigorous fighting spirit.

*Thwip!*

A moment later, the golden-armored man's left arm was severed!

"Ah..." He let out a tragic shriek, finding it almost impossible to believe that he would ultimately be the one to fall.

Qin Ming was also nearing his limit. Even if the opponent had only consumed one more potent elixir than the Golden Robbers, he was still an expert of another caliber after all. He swung his final strike, and with a *thwip*, severed the golden-armored man's head. Afterward, he himself fell backward onto the yellow sand.

Qin Ming endured the intense pain throughout his body, laughing there. He had actually succeeded in slaying a Saint!
