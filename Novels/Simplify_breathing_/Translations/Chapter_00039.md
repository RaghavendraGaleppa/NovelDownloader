# Chapter 39: Three Immortal Swords

In the backyard of the county yamen, Tan Zhen'an was slowly performing a set of fist techniques. Wherever his fists struck, a deep, resonant thud echoed, like a war drum being forcefully beaten, making one's heart involuntarily tighten.

Moments later, Tan Zhen'an concluded his forms and looked at Hua Shizhong beside him, asking, "Is it clear?"

"It's clear," Hua Shizhong nodded. "Within Pingyin County, the best internal energy cultivation methods are the Zhao family's Glorious Forest Internal Art, which their old ancestor brought back from outside years ago and is not weak even within the Viscera Training realm. There's also the Li family's Droplet Sword and the Zhang family's Cloud-Treading Sparrow, both extremely impressive."

"In ten days, gather some people and bring those cultivation methods back," Tan Zhen'an said, nodding.

"Those people might not be willing."

"Find an excuse. Unite with a few of the aristocratic families, and some will naturally be willing to be our vanguard."

"Good!" A cruel smile involuntarily appeared on Hua Shizhong's face; this was the kind of thing he enjoyed most. Making these families hand over money and resources was just the first step. The second step was to slowly devour a portion of them, leaving nothing behind. This method minimized resistance while maximizing profit.

"By the way, some greenwood friends want to join us. Should we take them in?"

"You decide," Tan Zhen'an said, taking a sip of tea. "Once you get those secret manuals, send them directly to me."

Chen Fei's entire understanding of this world came from Pingyin County. If he were to venture out rashly without any wilderness survival experience, Chen Fei felt he would fail before even starting.

The refining task assigned to Chen Fei by the Zhang family was indeed onerous for an ordinary alchemist. However, Chen Fei had already pushed the proficiency bar for the Grass Reversion Pill to Grand Completion, reaching the maximum yield per furnace. Thus, Chen Fei could complete the Zhang family's task in just two *shichen* (four hours). As for the remaining medicinal ingredients, Chen Fei naturally claimed them for himself. Presently, it was impossible to buy medicinal ingredients in Pingyin County or hire refugees to leave the city, as the rebel army had sealed off the entire county, allowing entry but no exit. Chen Fei had previously stockpiled some food out of concern for the rebels' arrival, and unexpectedly, it had come in handy.

In the black market, after being closed for three days, it quietly reopened. However, compared to its former bustling state, the black market was now deserted. The most sought-after goods were food and medicinal pills. Food, of course, was essential, while pills could be exchanged with aristocratic families for a little food. In the end, eating was the most crucial.

Inside a small hut, Chen Fei looked at Chi Defeng and asked, "Is there really no way to leave Pingyin County?" Although Chi Defeng always fobbed him off with some fake medicines, their relationship was actually quite decent.

Chen Fei cast a suspicious glance at Chi Defeng but said nothing more, turning to leave the black market.

Days passed, and the Zhang family came daily to collect the Grass Reversion Pills. The public order in Pingyin County began to deteriorate. The soldiers, previously restrained, gradually gave in to their nature. Looting and killing started to appear within Pingyin County. A large part of this was done by the rebel army, but some was also committed by the people of Pingyin County themselves. In this environment, the evil in some people's hearts was directly unleashed.

Cries and screams occasionally rang out. Chen Fei listened but made no move. Such matters were beyond his capabilities. Chen Fei simply cultivated even harder, not wasting a single moment. Perhaps it was this pressure, but on the fifth day, Chen Fei unexpectedly broke through the formula for the Light Spirit Pill, refining it for the first time.

[Alchemy: Light Spirit Pill (Initiate 1/100)]
"Simplifying Light Spirit Pill... Simplification successful... Light Spirit Pill → Grass Reversion Pill!"

A smile appeared on Chen Fei's face. Lately, no pills could be bought on the market. Now that he could refine Light Spirit Pills, relying on the medicinal ingredients he had previously stockpiled, he could finally be self-sufficient.

On the eighth day, the three movement technique manuals obtained from the Zhang family were completely merged by Chen Fei.

[Cultivation Method: Ascending Cloud Walk (Grand Completion)]

Compared to his previous Crossing River Cloud, Chen Fei's normal speed had now completely reached his former sprinting state. And if Chen Fei were to use the sprinting technique now, he would feel as swift as the wind and quick as lightning.

After a brief moment, Chen Fei opened his eyes, realizing that the feeling of controlling everything he had just experienced had vanished.
