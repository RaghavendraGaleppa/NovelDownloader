Chapter 342: Top Five of the Hidden Dragon List! A Name That Shakes the World!

At high noon, when the sun stood directly overhead.

Within Dragon Gate, floating light leaped like gold.

The liveliness at the Fish Dragon Lake rivaled the Martial Arts Summit of the Cloud Piercing Sword City from last time. Martial artists were everywhere.

They were all martial artists who owed favors to the Cloud Piercing Sword City, summoned by the call to discuss a great matter.

"The Sword City summoned us urgently; could it be that a great event has occurred?"

"Could it be related to what happened in the Southern Border?"

"The Southern Pacifying King's procession has already arrived in our Cloud Prefecture. Since he isn't in the Southern Border, is there truly a great chaos there?"

"Speaking of which, during the last ranking viewing, Young Master Li and Fairy Ying seemed to be slaying demons and vanquishing fiends in the Southern Border..."

"It's a pity. I came to Cloud Prefecture hoping to catch a glimpse of their风采 (grace and bearing)..."

......

The discussions among the martial artists soon quieted down.

Because words began to appear on the Dragon Gate.

[Hidden Dragon List Rank 100: Xiao Qin]
[Martial Arts: Two apertures of the Divine Observation Realm, perfected Six Harmonies Fist, Great Mastery of the Black Iron Wind-Slaying Sword, learned a profound Shape-Shifting Martial Art. In the Divine Observation Realm, he possesses more than ten Major Shapes and two Extreme Shapes. His martial arts are comprehensive with no obvious weaknesses, and he possesses a secret technique.]
[Combat Record: Fought the Hidden Wolf King (Eight Apertures of Divine Observation) to a standstill, exchanging severe injuries for the opponent's broken leg; at Thunder Fortress, sparred with Thunder Jiaojiao (Top 20 Hidden Dragon), and held his ground in the same realm.]
[Title: The Broken Wind Cripple Sword]

.....

[Hidden Dragon List Rank 86: Huang Donglai]
.....

[Hidden Dragon List Rank 68: Xu Yi]
.....

[Hidden Dragon List Rank 60: Zhong Zhenyue.]
.....

Zhong Zhenyue's ranking had risen another five spots.

However, this achievement did not break the silence on the second floor of the tavern, as if the noise from below could not reach it.

"Father, since you have the Emperor's decree, I shall take my leave shortly."

Zhong Zhenyue said firmly.

Zhong Qin lowered his eyelids slightly. Even at this moment, the Southern Pacifying King remained calm.

"But the Southern Pass still stands. I do not have the Emperor's decree. If I were to abandon my post and become a deserter, with the great enemy at the gates, I would be executed by military law."

Zhong Zhenyue did not think too much about it.

Even if Greenwood City is gone, the Southern Pass still remains.

If he does not return, the soldiers at the Southern Pass will be like a dragon without a head; the Pass might even fall.

But before leaving, he wanted to confirm one thing on the Hidden Dragon List.

Brother Li... is he still alive?

A moment later, the rankings on the Hidden Dragon List had reached the eighth position.

Zhong Zhenyue did not see the name he was looking for.

There was no Li Mo, nor was there Ying Bing.

The two elders of the Cloud Piercing Sword City had completely changed expressions.

Eighth, seventh, sixth. None of them were there.

Does this mean that the two young people who left a heavy mark on the history of the Cloud Piercing Sword City have perished along with Greenwood City?

This caused the hearts of those with similar feelings to sink to the bottom.

But the next second, Zhong Zhenyue's eyes widened suddenly.

He pointed at the iron-painted, silver-hooked characters on the Dragon Gate, his mouth agape, but he found himself voiceless, unable to speak.

[Hidden Dragon List Rank 5: Ying Bing]
[Martial Arts: Five apertures of the Divine Observation Realm, Sword Heart Clarity, Martial Arts attainment reaching Creation, possesses extremely powerful secret techniques. The observed Divine Shape is unknown.]
[Combat Record: Chief Disciple of the Clear Abyss Sect, Sword Hero of Cloud Prefecture, Azure Luan Goddess. Slew several Calamity Beasts across the border in the Southern Border. In the battle of Greenwood City, she commanded an army with unparalleled skill, manipulating tens of thousands of soldiers as if they were her own limbs, using military formations to condense a field comparable to the External Scene. Her musical attainment fully grasped the true meaning of the Azure Luan Clan Leader, surpassing the master. Later, she summoned the True Phoenix to descend, scaring away many high-level Calamity Beasts.]
[Title: Goddess of Gu She, Cold Fairy]

.....

[Hidden Dragon List Rank 4: Li Mo]
[Martial Arts: Five apertures of the Divine Observation Realm, Path of the Hammer reaching the heavens, Shape-Shifting Martial Arts reaching Creation. The observed Divine Shape is unknown.]
[Combat Record: Slaying the former Hidden Dragon Rank 16 Helian Wu. Possessing the potential of a "Ten Thousand-Man Enemy," capable of bearing the weight of a hundred armies. Amidst ten thousand soldiers, he beheaded the former dynasty's National Preceptor, dispelled the Blood God Phantom, and shook the Southern Border. Together with Ying Bing, he defended Greenwood City; his "Heaven-Sinking Hammer" turned the tide of a collapsing sky.]
[Title: Wife-Supporting Fighting Spirit, Little Tyrant of the Divine Hammer]

---

The Fish Dragon Lake fell silent at once.

Even the top three of the Hidden Dragon List were no longer paid attention to. After all, it was still those three: the Crown Prince, the Young Master of the Tianshan Sword Manor, and the Holy Son of the Demon Summoning Sect. They had been discussed over and over again.

Even if there were to be discussions, it would be about whether these three would still hold the top three spots next time...

Would it still be these three?

Countless martial artists of Cloud Prefecture looked as if they were dreaming, standing dumbfounded for a long time.

The bad news was that many had guessed correctly; something big had indeed happened in the Southern Border, something even bigger than imagined.

The good news was that the matter had been settled.

A situation that even experts of the Human Ranking and Earth Ranking might not have been able to handle was resolved by two rising stars of the Hidden Dragon List.

In the tavern.

"Ah? This..."

Zhong Zhenyue looked bewildered.

He had just made up his mind to fight to the death, building up his resolve for so long that he felt his blood boiling.

But now, a basin of cold water was poured over him.

"......"

Elder Xu's face flushed red. It took him a long time to say a sentence:

"They are so young; how can they be so terrifying?"

"Good, good, good..."

Elder Zeng let out a heavy sigh of relief, ultimately unable to suppress the corner of his mouth.

He thought they had nothing left to root for, but unexpectedly, the more he rooted, the more terrifying they became. Where could one find such logic?

"In that case, we don't need to gather the heroes to defend Cloud Prefecture?"

"Hahaha, since they are already here, let's invite them to the Sword City for a drink."

"Quite right, quite right. Let's toast to our Sword Hero and Li Sword Immortal; we should drink a great cup!"

The elders were overjoyed. Elder Zeng even said he had found inspiration again and would write two poems tonight.

Zhong Qin's expression, which remained unchanged even if Mount Tai collapsed in front of him, finally relaxed slightly, turning into an even more complex expression.

He looked up at the three suns.

The thousand-jin heavy burden on his shoulders remained.

"Set out for the capital."

When the Southern Pacifying King spoke, his voice returned to calm.

Zhong Zhenyue was about to say something, but Zhong Qin interrupted:

"They will eventually come to the Imperial Capital. You can wait for them there."

"Yes, Father."

......

Eastern Wasteland Region, Ziyang Prefecture City.

Ziyang Prefecture City does not have a Dragon Gate, but every issue of the Nine Heavens Ten Earths风云榜 (风云榜) is posted on the bulletin board at the city gate.

Sent by the Clear Abyss Sect.

As long as it is a sect officially appointed by the court with its own fief, they would receive the news at roughly the same time.

The news had arrived now.

Inside the Happy Hotpot Restaurant, everyone was silent for a moment.

The elders looked at each other, unable to help but think back to the beginning of the year. That boy was still ignorant, not having touched martial arts yet, and that girl was still troubled by her cold ailment, in danger of a beauty's fragile life.

Suddenly, these two names appeared simultaneously in the top five of the Hidden Dragon List.

They had become famous figures known throughout the Nine Heavens Ten Earths, truly shaking the world with their names.

It hasn't been that long.

How did it suddenly feel like a lifetime had passed?

"We don't need to leave anymore, hahaha, we don't need to leave!"

Xue Jing laughed so hard his molars showed.

"This stinky boy, why doesn't he reply to my Heart-Linked Bell?"

Shang Wu was happy inside, but her beautiful, gorgeous face was puffed up with anger. She put her hands on her hips and said that when Li Mo returns, she would definitely extort her precious disciple.

"Five Spirit Crystals, five. I knew I shouldn't have filled the warship all at once."

Elder Qian's face twitched with heartache.

"Forget it, what's done is done. Let's eat first."
