# Chapter 171: The Sword Above Lin Family Fortress  

"You faked your death! Aren't you ashamed?"  

Lin Musheng's icy words echoed across the square, audible to everyone present. His gaze locked onto Lin San, confident that the other man could feel the fury burning in his eyes.  

"If it lures you out, what does faking my death matter? You stole my family's treasure and fled. I'll resort to any trick necessary to bring you down," Lin San replied indifferently, brushing off the last flickering embers clinging to his clothes. His tone was casual, as if discussing the weather rather than a life-and-death confrontation.
