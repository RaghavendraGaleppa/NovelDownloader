# Chapter 31: Earth Ranking  

Is there any justice in this world?  

Absolutely none.  

The name "Yu Yun" clung to Dou Changsheng like a curse, tightening around him relentlessly.  

Taking a deep breath, Dou Changsheng suppressed his turbulent emotions. He knew all too well—his streak of misfortune had struck again.  

Had the future Dou Changsheng been here instead, he wouldn’t have even known the military pay had gone missing from Sanyang Mountain. He would’ve happily been welcomed by the Sanyang Sect, effortlessly proven himself, and left without a hitch.  

Such was fate.  

But then Dou Changsheng thought of those brothers who didn’t even have a system yet still suffered from bad luck, and suddenly, he felt a little better.  

Better than some, worse than others.  

Dou Changsheng refused outright. "The case of the missing military pay has shaken the court. Such an important investigation would surely be entrusted to a high-ranking official. As for me? I’m just a nobody from the countryside."  

"What qualifications do I have to handle such a major case?"  

"Sister Qingyan, you’ve got the wrong person."  

Tang Qingyan’s expression was sincere, her tone earnest. "I understand the weight of this responsibility, Changsheng. And though this is our first meeting, as the saying goes—appearances can be deceiving."  

"Trust is hard to come by, so it’s only natural you wouldn’t confide in me. I won’t pry into your plans. But if you ever find yourself near Sanyang Mountain and need help, consider me an ally."  

"I hail from Southern Chen, not Northern Jin. I have no ties to the major factions here. My journey north is to repay a debt of gratitude."  

"Changsheng, you must be careful—especially around those in Northern Jin who were once close to General Yu."  

"With General Yu imprisoned, the situation is far too complicated. Gratitude can’t compete with money, power, or self-interest."  

"Prime Minister Chen Qingyao is no mere upstart who rose through favoritism. He belongs to the same era as the Demon Master Lin Xuanqi. For a decade, the Demon Master dominated the martial world—those were his years on the Human Ranking."  

"From the moment he rose, his momentum was unstoppable. After leaving the Human Ranking, he soared straight to the Earth Ranking. Today, he stands at the very top—undisputed, unrivaled."  

"Yet in that same generation, one man, though repeatedly defeated, remained close behind."  

"Chen Qingyao, who styles himself the Ghost Valley Divine Lord, ranks third on the Earth Ranking."  

"These two dominated the top three of their generation’s Human Ranking, hailed as the strongest in recent history."  

"Bear in mind, sometimes an entire generation passes without a single Earth Ranking contender breaking into the top ten."  

"Northern Jin is a great nation. Its prime minister is no ordinary figure."  

"Yet the kingdom now faces internal strife and external threats, all stemming from the sudden death of the late emperor and the ascension of the young ruler."  

"In the late emperor’s time, with Chen Qingyao governing internally and Yu Yun guarding the borders, Northern Jin stood strong—repelling the northern barbarians and suppressing Southern Chen. What glory that was."  

"But since the young emperor took the throne, the kingdom has declined. The prime minister and the general are at odds, locked in struggle."  

"Figures like Chen Qingyao and Yu Yun—used wisely, they can strengthen a nation. Used poorly, they can destroy it."  

"Too much power isn’t always a blessing."  

Tang Qingyan’s expression darkened, her eyes clouded with emotion. She sighed. "The Heavenly Demon Sect was once a martial faction controlled by the Embroidered Guard. But after the rise of the Demon Master Lin Xuanqi, the sect turned the tables—taking over the Embroidered Guard and infiltrating the court."  

"Countless officials in Great Chen secretly collude with the Heavenly Demon Sect."  

"Even my Tang Clan had to send members to study under the Heavenly Sword Sect, relying on their influence to secure safety in Jiangdu."  

"Every family has its struggles."  

Her words carried the weight of a nation’s plight—great powers faced difficulties, but smaller ones suffered even more. The very fate of a country could slip from the ruler’s grasp, usurped by powerful ministers. Only the fear of provoking intervention from greater powers kept them from outright declaring themselves sovereign.  

In this world, martial artists roamed freely. A hundred years ago, they were like weeds by the roadside, unnoticed. But a century later, a single man could stride into the imperial palace three times—starting from the Chaotian Gate, breaking through every barrier with ease, walking straight into the Hall of Supreme Harmony as if the army of thousands were nothing.  

The Demon Master Lin Xuanqi was Southern Chen’s greatest shame.  

Compared to him, the so-called "Demonic Prime Minister" paled in significance.  

Had it been the Demon Master, there would’ve been no northern conflicts. He would’ve long since marched beyond the frontier, into the northern steppes, to debate philosophy with the barbarian chieftains.  

Because of him, Southern Chen had grown powerful, even threatening to surpass the other three nations. But the consequences were dire.  

Shaking off her melancholy, Tang Qingyan turned back to Dou Changsheng. "The situation at Sanyang Sect is complicated. They’re undoubtedly involved in the missing military pay."  

"Be careful when you go up the mountain."  

From her sleeve, she produced a red paper crane and handed it to him. "If you’re truly in danger and need help, channel your innate qi into this."  

"It carries a trace of my divine sense. Once activated, it will find me."  

"I’ll come as soon as I receive word."  

"But use it cautiously. Don’t let a Divine Transformation master see it, or they’ll detect you."  

Dou Changsheng carefully stored the crane, his heart pounding. Her words revealed something startling—this seemingly disabled woman, Tang Qingyan, was actually a formidable expert, a master who had reached the Divine Transformation realm.  

The Tang Clan of Jiangdu, a renowned sword-forging family, was no weakling. Yet even they lived under the shadow of the Heavenly Demon Sect. It was a reminder—nowhere in this world was truly safe.  

But then again, anyone daring to travel from the south to the capital had to have some strength.  

After tucking away the crane, Tang Qingyan added, "I’ve already sent word to Sanyang Sect. They’ll send disciples to escort you up the mountain."  

"Outsiders can’t ascend—only you and your group can."  

"Be cautious once you’re there."  

After these final warnings, Dou Changsheng stepped out of the room to find attendants waiting. Glancing back, he saw the room was empty—no trace of Tang Qingyan, not even the teacups remained. It was as if he had imagined the entire encounter.  

Or perhaps he’d met a ghost.  

"Young Hero Dou," a disciple greeted. "The feast is prepared on the mountain. All the other young heroes have arrived. The sect leader invites you to ascend."

**Author’s Note:**  

A quick correction—*Five Qi Seal* was meant for the future Dou Changsheng, not the current one. The current Dou Changsheng already knows it, so it’s an upgraded version. Just a minor edit with an added line. My apologies!  

Also, it’s been a week with no updates. Not sure if this revival attempt will succeed, but here’s hoping for a recommendation.  

Planning to drop 8k words if it works out.  

If not… well, pretend I never said anything.  

Fingers crossed!
