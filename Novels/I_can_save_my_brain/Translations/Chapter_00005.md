# Chapter 5: Our Family Is Poor  

With a heavy heart, Chen Daoxuan left the laboratory.  

For the first time in five years, he skipped his daily routine of practicing artifact forging and hurriedly departed on the wind.  

By the time he arrived at his thirteenth uncle’s cave dwelling again, night had already fallen.  

Lifting his head, he gazed at the starry sky—it had been sixteen years since he arrived in this world.  

With a mature soul residing within him, Chen Daoxuan often felt out of place in this world whenever he was alone.  

"Daoxuan!"  

Just as he was lost in thought, an aged voice snapped him back to reality.  

Coming to his senses, Chen Daoxuan saw his thirteenth uncle, Chen Xianhe, standing before him, looking at him with concern.  

"Thirteenth Uncle!"  

Chen Daoxuan quickly bowed in greeting.  

Chen Xianhe stepped forward and gently patted his shoulder, saying meaningfully, "Child, you've suffered."  

Chen Daoxuan remained silent.  

After a long pause, he retrieved three large and one small chunk of copper ore from his storage pouch. "Thirteenth Uncle, this is the ore I collected from the copper mine today. As you predicted, the output has decreased again."  

Though he had expected it, Chen Xianhe still felt a pang of sorrow upon hearing the news.  

For the past three hundred years, the Chen family's copper mine had been the backbone of their cultivators' resources. Now, they were about to lose it entirely. Beyond the material loss, as the last remaining elder of the Chen family's "Xian" generation, the emotional toll was hard to bear.  

Chen Xianhe could still vividly recall the carefree days when he and his twelve elder brothers had laughed and joked together.  

But with the passage of time, all of it had vanished like smoke.  

His brothers had fallen in battle, and he, the youngest among them, had been left to shoulder the family's burdens alone.  

Chen Daoxuan, however, felt little attachment to the copper mine. To him, it was merely a spiritual ore vein—nothing more.  

Chen Xianhe glanced at the copper ore in Chen Daoxuan's hands and shook his head. "Keep these for your artifact forging practice."  

"Yes, Thirteenth Uncle," Chen Daoxuan replied with a bow.  

"By the way, how is your progress in artifact forging?"  

At the mention of Chen Daoxuan's studies, a trace of nervousness flickered across Chen Xianhe's face.  

Straightening up, Chen Daoxuan answered solemnly, "The family's forging heritage records the methods for crafting thirteen types of artifacts—twelve first-tier and one second-tier. So far, I've mastered the forging techniques for six first-tier low-grade artifacts. As for the remaining four first-tier mid-grade and two first-tier high-grade artifacts, I haven't yet succeeded."  

Hearing this, Chen Xianhe's eyes filled with satisfaction. "Mastering all the first-tier low-grade forging techniques in just five years is already remarkable!"  

Chen Xianhe knew well that although the family possessed forging knowledge, there was no one to teach it. Chen Daoxuan had learned entirely on his own—a grueling process Chen Xianhe understood deeply.  

After all, every cultivator of the "Xian" generation had attempted to study the family's second-tier forging heritage, yet none had managed to grasp it.  

The path of artifact forging was inherently difficult. Beyond the massive resource expenditure, guidance from a master was essential for smooth progress.  

This was why rogue cultivators rarely produced alchemists or forgers.  

The mere acquisition of forging knowledge was a barrier, let alone the resources required to practice.  

Seeing Chen Xianhe's pleased expression, Chen Daoxuan felt a twinge of guilt.  

He had lied.  

In truth, he hadn't just mastered the six first-tier low-grade artifacts—he had grasped all thirteen forging techniques in the family's heritage, except for the second-tier method.  

To be precise, Chen Daoxuan was now a first-tier high-grade forger.  

He wasn't hiding his abilities out of malice—it was simply too shocking.  

A mere third-level Qi Refining cultivator, yet his forging skills surpassed even those of veteran first-tier forgers at the ninth level of Qi Refining—all achieved through self-study.  

This wasn't just talent—it was monstrous.  

Of course, due to his cultivation level, while Chen Daoxuan understood the methods for forging first-tier high-grade artifacts, his success rate remained abysmally low.  

The reason was simple: first-tier high-grade artifacts required refining more spiritual ore over longer periods. Given Chen Daoxuan's limited true qi and spiritual sense, sustaining the process to completion was nearly impossible.  

The subsequent shaping and array integration posed little difficulty for him.  

After five years of study, he had only occasionally succeeded in forging a first-tier high-grade artifact.  

At his current level, crafting first-tier low-grade artifacts was effortless, mid-grade artifacts were challenging, and high-grade artifacts relied entirely on luck.  

It wasn't a lack of skill—it was a lack of cultivation. His true qi and spiritual sense were insufficient.  

This was precisely why Chen Daoxuan was so desperate to develop a spiritual ore smelting furnace.  

With such a furnace, he could conserve his true qi and spiritual sense during the material refinement phase, allowing him to focus more easily on shaping and array integration.  

At that point, not only first-tier high-grade artifacts, but even second-tier artifacts might be within his reach.  

Chen Daoxuan's momentary guilt vanished as he quickly composed himself and said earnestly, "I dare not claim credit. Without the family's unwavering support these years, my forging skills wouldn't have advanced so quickly."  

This wasn't an exaggeration.  

Over the past five years, the Chen family of Twin Lakes Island had invested spiritual ore materials equivalent to at least five thousand spirit stones into his training.  

Such a staggering sum was beyond the means of most rogue cultivators—even many established cultivation families couldn't afford it.  

The Chen family's ability to provide these resources stemmed from three centuries of accumulation and the wealth amassed by the "Xian" generation on the battlefield.  

Even so, Chen Daoxuan's studies had placed immense strain on the family, forcing Patriarch Chen Xianhe to consider abandoning the copper mine to focus entirely on nurturing Chen Daoxuan.  

Hearing his words, Chen Xianhe smiled and nodded. "Modest and humble—excellent!"  

Then, shifting the topic, he continued, "Daoxuan, you know our family is poor. So you must cherish this opportunity to learn forging."  

"I will remember your words, Uncle."  

After reporting further on the full-scale mining of the copper vein, Chen Daoxuan took his leave on the wind.  

Watching him depart, Chen Xianhe slowly returned to his cave dwelling.  

As the current patriarch, Chen Xianhe's dwelling, though its spiritual vein had dried up, was far more spacious and imposing than Chen Daoxuan's.  

Of course, the reason Chen Xianhe hadn't furnished Chen Daoxuan's dwelling luxuriously was to prevent the young man from indulging in extravagance too early.  

This well-intentioned decision was something he could never explain to outsiders.  

After navigating through several passages, Chen Xianhe arrived before a wall made of dragon-sealing stone.  

Placing his palm against it, he channeled his true qi, causing the inscribed formation patterns to glow.  

The stone wall slowly slid aside, revealing a hidden chamber.  

As Chen Xianhe stepped inside, the chamber illuminated with a radiant glow—stacked densely within were fist-sized spirit stones, gleaming like stars.
