# Chapter 39: High-Grade Spirit Pills

"Junior Brother!" 

Seeing that Zhang Jing still didn't trust him, the man could only explain with a bitter smile:

"Senior Brother truly means no harm."

"You must have noticed when selling talismans at the Thousand Techniques Pavilion just now. Superior-grade talismans are in short supply there too. Especially recently, their stock of high-quality talismans has been particularly tight. For someone like me to buy dozens at once, they simply won't sell them temporarily."

"Ah, let me be honest with you."

The man sighed and continued:

"I recently rented a shop here to sell talismans and materials for making them. I've already contacted cooperative talisman masters. The only thing missing now is some superior-grade talismans to boost the shop's reputation. I swear by my Dao heart that every word I've said is true."

So that was the reason.

Zhang Jing's expression softened slightly before he smiled and said, "Junior Brother understands now. Please wait a moment, Senior Brother, let me check if I have any more."

With that, he pretended to rummage through his storage bag.

While Zhang Jing was searching, the man looked at his youthful face and asked casually, "Junior Brother, may I ask if you've joined any mission teams? With your exceptional talent in talisman-making, being in an ordinary team would be a waste of your potential."

"You haven't even reached mid-stage Qi Refinement yet—that's proof of how ordinary mission teams are holding back your talent."

"Coincidentally, the Nine Fangs team I belong to is ranked fifteenth among the outer courtyard teams. It has many strong members and abundant cultivation resources. If you'd like to switch teams, I can introduce you! We'd all be on the same side then."

By the end, his tone was full of temptation.

Hearing this, Zhang Jing suddenly realized that while this senior brother's reason for buying superior-grade talismans at a high price to boost his shop's reputation might be true, his real intention was actually to recruit him into the Nine Fangs team.

Had his talisman-making skills been too eye-catching?

With that thought, he took out five Star Guidance Talismans and five Scorching Sun Talismans from his storage bag and handed them to the man, apologizing:

"Senior Brother, I'm really sorry, but this is all I have left. Twenty Dao merits will suffice."

"Also, I appreciate your kind offer, but I'm currently with the Luo Du team and have no intention of switching for now. I hope you understand."

The man's expression turned stunned.

He took the talismans, counted them, and then said somewhat awkwardly:

"My apologies for being presumptuous, Junior Brother. Please forget what I just said."

---

"Junior Brother, please show me your identity jade token so I can transfer the Dao merits."

After confirming he had received twenty Dao merits, Zhang Jing couldn't help but ask with a smile:

"Senior Brother, will you need more of these superior-grade talismans in the future?"

"Naturally."

The man pointed to a shop not far behind him and said politely, "If possible, Junior Brother, I'd like to reserve ten defensive talismans and ten offensive talismans from you each month. I'll still buy them at the same price."

"Rest assured, Senior Brother, I won't let you down. Then I'll take my leave first."

Zhang Jing cupped his hands in farewell and turned to leave.

Behind him, the man watched Zhang Jing's retreating figure and grumbled inwardly:

"Damn it, why do all these monstrous talents end up in those top-ten behemoth teams? Can't they share some with us?"

Judging by his age, that junior brother must have entered the Dao Academy in the previous batch.

To reach such an astonishing level in talisman-making in just three years—he was undoubtedly destined to become an inner-court member of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion in the future.

What a shame he wasn't part of our team!

Otherwise, we'd never have to worry about high-quality talismans again.

---

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing was walking briskly toward the entrance.

He decided not to sell the remaining talismans.

The sudden appearance of that senior brother had reminded him—with his current low cultivation level, it was better to be cautious.

He then thought that since he had run out of Purple Spirit Pills, and the pill-selling section of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion wasn't far, he might as well buy some spirit pills.

Zhang Jing understood clearly that cultivation was the foundation in the Dao Academy.

Now that his talismans were selling well, the Dao merits he earned would only increase. Naturally, he wouldn't skimp on spending them for spirit pills.

He glanced at his identity jade pendant.

It showed 258 Dao merits.

Fifty were this month's reward from the Dao Academy, another hundred came from selling talismans just now, and the remaining 109 were leftovers from before.

Wait—that seemed to be missing one Dao merit!

After a moment's thought, Zhang Jing realized that single Dao merit must have been secretly deducted by the Heavenly Crafts Pavilion—for the initial Tranquil Mind Meditation Mat.

---

Half a quarter-hour later, Zhang Jing slowly arrived in front of a spacious and exquisitely decorated shop.

Even standing outside, he could faintly catch the alluring fragrance of medicinal pills wafting from within.

A young man in a blue robe stood at the entrance, seemingly having waited for some time, and smiled at Zhang Jing:

"Junior Brother, what kind of pills are you looking for?"

"Senior Brother, I'd like to buy some cultivation-aiding spirit pills," Zhang Jing replied evenly.

"Right this way, Junior Brother."

With that, the blue-robed young man led Zhang Jing straight to a counter inside.

As they walked, he softly explained:

"Junior Brother, we have many types of cultivation-aiding spirit pills here. The most commonly used—and cheapest—are the Purple Spirit Pills. A bottle of ten costs twelve Dao merits. There are also some high-grade pills, like the Essence Water Pills, Triple Yang Nourishment Pills, and Verdant Harvest Spirit Pills, but those are considerably more expensive."

Soon, they arrived at a counter.

Zhang Jing's gaze swept past the Purple Spirit Pills and went straight to the high-grade pills the man had mentioned.

After earning a hefty sum today, couldn't he indulge a little?

But the next moment, he averted his eyes.

The senior brother hadn't lied—they were indeed expensive!

Essence Water Pill: 28 Dao merits per pill.

Triple Yang Nourishment Pill: 24 Dao merits per pill.

Verdant Harvest Spirit Pill: 18 Dao merits per pill.

"Senior Brother, may I ask why these pills cost over twenty times more than Purple Spirit Pills?" Zhang Jing asked, slightly shocked.

"Haha, Junior Brother, it's naturally because of the precious ingredients required to refine them."

The blue-robed young man grinned, as if accustomed to such questions, and explained:

"Purple Spirit Pills are made primarily from wisps of violet qi collected at sunrise, supplemented with common medicinal herbs like spirit ginseng and vermilion fruit. Since the materials are easily obtainable, they're naturally cheaper."

"High-grade pills are different. Take the Essence Water Pill, for example. Its main ingredient is the Essence Water Quintessence gathered from the deepest parts of the Thousand-Mile Dragon Marsh Lake—extremely rare and precious. Naturally, the pill's price is correspondingly high. In fact, this price is already discounted specially for Dao Academy disciples."

"In the outside world, this would be considered a supreme treasure for water-attribute cultivators. No amount of spirit stones could buy a single pill."

"Senior Brother, how do their effects compare to Purple Spirit Pills?"

Zhang Jing asked again.

"They're not even in the same league."

"I see. Thank you, Senior Brother." Zhang Jing took out his identity jade pendant and said calmly, "Please give me two bottles of Purple Spirit Pills and one Essence Water Pill."

"Hmm?"

The man looked at Zhang Jing in surprise, seemingly not expecting him to purchase an Essence Water Pill.

"Are you sure, Junior Brother?"

Zhang Jing nodded.

"One moment, please."

Before long, Zhang Jing accepted the pills and turned to leave, not daring to look back.

---

After purchasing spirit paper and ink, he directly exited the Thousand Techniques Pavilion.

On the back of a spirit crane, Zhang Jing couldn't help but glance back at the Thousand Techniques Pavilion before shaking his head.

Still too poor. Better hurry back and make more talismans.

P.S.: I was drowsy all day today, so I'll post 5k words for now. The extra 4k words are still being written overnight—you'll see them tomorrow morning.
