# Chapter 249: Setting Off for the Southern Frontier, Baoping Town!

Huang Donglai recommended it with great excitement:

"Brother Li, take a look at this first. This is Bailing Baicao Ku (Green Forest Hundred Grass Wither), an excellent medicine for eliminating pests and weeds when cultivating spiritual herbs. Not only is its effect outstanding, but the price is also very cheap."

"The drawback is that the smell is too pungent; you can smell it from a long distance."

He took out a porcelain bottle and pulled out the stopper, immediately releasing a pungent odor.

"Brother Huang, I'm not going to the Southern Frontier to engage in farming."

Li Mo was somewhat puzzled as to why Huang Donglai would recommend such a thing to him.

Bringing a bottle of herbicide while traveling?

This isn't useful at all...

"Brother Li, you don't know this."

Huang Donglai looked around and lowered his voice:

"I have a unique secret recipe. As long as you use Purple Vine Apples to process it, you can neutralize the pungent smell of the Baicao Ku, turning it into a colorless and odorless deadly poison!"

"So that's what 'outstanding effect' means."

Li Mo carefully analyzed the medicinal properties of the two substances.

Based on his experience in cooking and alchemy, it was indeed feasible.

"Which temple did this great master come out of?" Huang Donglai didn't forget about Murong Xiao either.

"I am Murong Xiao, a fellow disciple with Brother Li."

Murong Xiao's expression turned solemn:

"Brother, you have misunderstood. Aside from losing all my hair and needing to recite scriptures and eat vegetarian food daily, in what other way am I like a monk?"

He did all this to suppress the power of his bloodline.

Li Mo: "......"

Does it need to be alike in other places?

As he spoke, Murong Xiao scanned the hall, then his eyes lit up.

He saw an old monk.

So Murong Xiao walked over to the old monk and said:

"You see, the difference is still quite significant."

"Which temple are the two great masters from? Would you like to try our Hengtong Mercantile Guild's wooden fish? I am also a believer in Buddhism, I can give you two a discount."

"I'll knock your head off!" Murong Xiao was furious and trembling with cold.

"Amitabha." The old monk chanted a Buddhist name.

"Great Master, we meet again."

Li Mo raised his eyebrows slightly.

The old monk was none other than Heng Yuan. It was unclear when he had arrived, or if he had been waiting for them all along.

Li Mo felt it was the latter.

Li Mo asked:

"Since we are going to the Southern Frontier, does the Great Master have any advice for us?"

"......"

Heng Yuan had cultivated the Samadhi of Silence; aside from Buddhist names and scriptures, he could not speak other words.

So he began gesturing with his hands.

Li Mo didn't understand.

But Murong Xiao blurted out:

"Simply do good deeds... do not ask about the future?"

"?"

Li Mo looked at him in surprise. He had never seen Murong Xiao learn sign language.

How could he understand the old monk's meaning?

"Amitabha."

Heng Yuan's Buddhist name still echoed in their ears.

But when they looked up again, he was nowhere to be seen.

Li Mo couldn't quite figure out the intentions of this powerful Zen cultivator at the Outer Scene realm.

But from the information given by the Eye of Providence, he should have no ill intent.

Since that was the case, there was no need to worry too much about it.

Business was urgent.

"Brother Li, I still have many recommendations for items that are effective against people in the dark. Would you like to take another look? Or tell me, what are you going to the Southern Frontier for?" Huang Donglai, true to his original intention, took out a small notebook.

It contained many clever tricks for dealing with people and poison formulas.

"Actually, I'm going to the Southern Frontier mainly to find someone."

Li Mo's mouth twitched slightly as he looked at the small notebook.

The cover clearly read "The Laws of Martial Arts Survival," and the zeroth entry on the first page was:

[Beware of hammers!]

What is all this?

Huang Donglai thought for a moment upon hearing this and said:

"Then I know what Brother Li needs most."

---

"What is it?" Li Mo asked.

Huang Donglai pointed a finger at himself: "It's me."

Li Mo: "?"

"The terrain of the Southern Frontier is as complex as its political situation. Not only is there the Southern Border Army stationed by the Great Yu Dynasty, but there are also the demon clans and the Demonic Invocation Cult."

"The border army's management is lax, the Demonic Invocation Cult lurks in the shadows waiting for an opportunity, and the demon clans are even more complicated internally, with numerous factions and power struggles. This requires someone who understands the situation in the Southern Frontier well. My hometown is in the Southern Frontier."

Upon hearing Huang Donglai's words, Li Mo fell into thought.

He had always heard about the chaos in the Southern Frontier.

It was a region that even the Great Yu Dynasty had not fully controlled.

Ahem...

Actually, from Huang Donglai's extremely cautious personality, one could see that the place that nurtured such a cautious nature could not possibly be a peaceful land.

He and Murong Xiao were like blind flies crashing into it.

Who knew how long it would take to reach the territory of the Mingjiao Clan.

Li Mo nodded and said: "I plan to go to the Mingjiao Clan's territory first. Brother Huang, you haven't saved enough money to buy the medicinal herbs yet, have you?"

"Those medicinal herbs are quite expensive... Brother Li should just buy what he needs first. The Mingjiao Clan's territory is very far away."

Huang Donglai was somewhat conflicted.

Aside from poisons and clever little items, he didn't know what else to recommend to Brother Li.

It seemed like this item was useful, and that one was also useful.

He had never fought such a wealthy battle before; in the past, he always purchased only what he needed most.

"Brother Huang, have you calculated a certain account?"

"What account?"

Li Mo smiled slightly:

"With this deposit slip, after clearing out the Mercantile Guild's inventory, there should still be a surplus."

Huang Donglai: "......"

Who normally calculates things like this?

But thinking about it, as long as he doesn't buy martial arts or weapons, it really would be enough.

Thus, the greatest sales champion in the history of the Hengtong Mercantile Guild appeared.

Sun Gui was extremely shocked when he heard the news.

He was just about to ask the sales champion for his name...

...when he received the other party's resignation.

The Sales Champion Huang had already transformed into Little Li's exclusive guide for the Southern Frontier.

A low-key carriage drove straight out of Yunzhou City.

This carriage looked simple, but its material was extremely solid, and it was equipped with various emergency measures.

It also had a highly precise map.

Huang Donglai stood in front of the map and pointed lightly:

"Brother Li, this is the habitat of the Mingjiao Clan, called Black Water Marsh."

He carefully planned the route:

"After leaving the Southern Pass through the Jinghai Dense Forest, our first stop will be here!"

Li Mo sat up straight to look.

On the map, it clearly read:

"Baoping Town."

.........

Thousands of miles away.

From a bird's-eye view, the small town was surrounded by mountains on three sides, as if placed inside a bottle.

The green mountains were covered in lush terraced fields.

The sky was bright, and three suns scorched the earth, distorting the figures of people sweating in the fields. The style of clothing worn by some of the people was quite different from that in the territories ruled by the Great Yu Dynasty.

While working, the people chatted with each other.

"Ah, the harvest is poor this year."

"After offering a portion to the government troops, it's uncertain if we'll have enough food to get through this year."

"But if we don't support Commander Qi, what do we do if the demon clans enter the village and eat people?"

"That's right... our village is relatively peaceful. Haven't you heard? The village eight hundred miles away couldn't pay the grain, the government troops withdrew, and the entire village was eaten by disaster beasts."

"By the way, the girl who passed through the village looks extraordinary."

...

Amidst the discussion, they couldn't help but look towards a distance.

Inside a shade pavilion.

There was a girl as clear as the cold moon, her gaze fixed on the distance.

Her fair hand took a mooncake from a big-headed doll.

The pattern on the mooncake was surprisingly very similar to the big-headed doll.
