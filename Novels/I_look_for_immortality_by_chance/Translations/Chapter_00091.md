# Chapter 91: The Hidden Ruins of Zhongshan, the Misty Cloud Secret Realm!

"Who would have thought that an unknown junior would take first place!"

"Who is this person? Senior Brother Zhang has cultivated diligently for thirty years, even the elders of Green Peak Dao Academy wanted to take him as a disciple, yet he still lost to this newcomer?"

"Unknown? When a sharp point is in the bag, it must emerge. This Mystic Herb Banquet is likely the beginning of his rise to fame in the academy."

"Our academy truly has no shortage of talent. Even someone emerging from an obscure corner can possess such strength."

"Enough talk, quickly investigate—who is this person? Whose golden token did he use to enter Yunxuan Island?"

"...It seems to be from Elder Xiang Ronghua?"

"Elder Xiang? Although Elder Xiang loves wealth and often sells his golden tokens, he isn't reckless. He wouldn't recommend someone without any background or reputation."

"...Found it! I checked the records—his name is Gu Yuan!"

In the jade hall, discussions buzzed fervently until a disciple from the Personnel Hall suddenly shouted.

"Gu Yuan... that name sounds familiar. Where have I heard it before?"

"Could it be... that minor sect disciple who entered the academy through the bounty offered by Sword Fox Sage?"

"W-what? It's only been a few years, and he's already qualified to compete in the Mystic Herb Banquet—and even took first place?"

"My father was blind! So short-sighted! He should have married my sister to him long ago!"

"So it was the Sage's recommendation..."

Amidst the clamor in the jade hall, Gu Yuan's background was pieced together. Upon hearing the name "Sword Fox Sage," everyone suddenly understood. Those who had been resentful before now let go of their grudges.

Meanwhile, Gu Yuan, who had been standing on the silver steps, had already vanished, teleported away by the grand formation. The jade hall, now devoid of the formation's power, returned to its normal size.

As for Bian Chuyao, she too had disappeared without a trace at some point. Only graceful shell maidens filed in, placing spirit fruits and delicacies on the jade tables.

The crowd knew this was the final compensation—once they finished eating, they could all return home. The matter of the Mystic Herb was no longer their concern.

Shan Yunlong glared hatefully toward the back of the golden hall, downing cup after cup of bitter wine.

Inside the inner hall of the Golden Cauldron Palace, Gu Yuan sat at a jade table while Bian Chuyao, smiling faintly, took the seat opposite him.

Up close, Gu Yuan noticed that Bian Chuyao was not only stunningly beautiful but also had skin so fair it seemed to glow, like a sculpture of jade.

"Senior Brother Gu, your skills and temperament are truly admirable. As promised, the Golden-Slaying Mystic Herb is yours."

Without further pleasantries, Bian Chuyao retrieved a small jade box and slid it toward Gu Yuan.

Inside the box lay a golden spirit herb, faintly shimmering like a sharp sword. Despite being sealed in the jade container, it still trembled slightly, as if breathing in spiritual energy.

"Many thanks, Junior Sister Bian."

Gu Yuan activated his Heavenly Insight Eyes to carefully examine the herb before sweeping it into his storage pouch with a flick of his sleeve. Then, he rose to take his leave.

"Senior Brother Gu, wait!"

Seeing this, Bian Chuyao quickly stood and stopped him.

"Senior Brother, I mentioned earlier that whoever could break my formation would receive a generous gift. Since you surpassed all expectations, how could I go back on my word? I have another gift for you."

Gu Yuan merely turned back calmly, his gaze steady.

Bian Chuyao sighed inwardly, realizing he already suspected something about the earlier competition. Without further pretense, she produced an emerald-green token.

"This Azure Jade Token is my gift to you, Senior Brother."

"Do you know its origin?"

Gu Yuan shook his head.

"Centuries ago, the ruler of Zhongshan Kingdom, deceived by demons, defied the Heavenly Court's laws and recklessly launched a war to exterminate sects."

"Ultimately, our academy, acting on the Heavenly Court's decree, executed the king and reduced his vast territory to a land of annihilation, ending the farce."

"Do you know what a land of annihilation is?"

Bian Chuyao asked softly.

Gu Yuan, of course, knew. Among the records in Yun Hanxiu's storage pouch regarding the Three Seals, this event was mentioned. After extensive research in the scripture repository, he had uncovered the details.

A land of annihilation was a unique space created by the Heavenly Court through immense power. Within it, spiritual energy was sealed, ensuring no living being could surpass the Qi Refinement stage or live beyond 150 years.

Over time, the spiritual energy in this space would dwindle until it vanished entirely, leaving only silence and death—a punishment for rebels, forcing them to fade away in regret.

Yet, these lands also became treasure troves for cultivators. Though thoroughly looted before being sealed, remnants inevitably remained. In the first few centuries, spiritual energy was still sufficient to sustain spirit herbs and exotic creatures.

While the inhabitants of these lands could never leave, spirit herbs and treasures could be taken. External cultivators, unbound by the land's restrictions, could freely enter and exit.

Thus, lands of annihilation earned another name—Hidden Ruins—ideal grounds for Qi Refinement cultivators to explore.

Some even fell in love with the women inside and chose to stay forever, establishing kingdoms and living in luxury.

When Zhongshan Kingdom was reduced to a land of annihilation, it became one such Hidden Ruin. Before the True Dragon's demise and the academy's conquests, the Zhongshan Hidden Ruins were a frequent destination for disciples.

However, entering wasn't easy—one needed a corresponding token to pass through.

Tokens weren't rare; the academy had forged many when sealing the land. But each token was linked to a different location. Some might transport the bearer to a spiritual mountain, while others might drop them into a horde of beasts.

"This Azure Jade Token will take you directly to Misty Cloud Mountain in Zhongshan."

After her explanation, Bian Chuyao smiled softly, her tone laced with temptation.

Misty Cloud Mountain held the same significance in Zhongshan as Green Peak Mountain did in the academy—a true core realm, a mountain of treasures! Before Zhongshan's fall, it was known as the Misty Cloud Secret Realm.

"Senior Brother Gu, wouldn't you say this is a generous gift?"

Bian Chuyao beamed.

"Junior Sister Bian speaks only of treasures, not risks. That hardly seems honest..."

Gu Yuan shook his head.

Over the years, he had gathered extensive intelligence and knew the dangers of Misty Cloud Mountain. Though plundered by the academy and stripped of its powerful cultivators, the mountain had since become infested with monstrous creatures and demonic beasts, feasting on the corpses of fallen cultivators and turning the area into a den of evil.

Many Qi Refinement ninth-layer cultivators, lacking tokens to teleport directly, had traversed thousands of miles through Zhongshan to reach Misty Cloud Mountain, only to perish there.

The place was perilous. Unconfident in his ability to survive, Gu Yuan had postponed his plans to explore the Three Hearts Seal, opting instead to first break through to the ninth layer of Qi Refinement.

"But Senior Brother, you just displayed such formidable power... Surely you can handle mere demons?"
