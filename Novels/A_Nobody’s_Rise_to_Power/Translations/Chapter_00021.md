# Chapter 21: Zhang Yi's Tongue

“Nonsense! That is nothing but sophistry and lies!”

Second Master Suo slammed the table heavily and rose in a great rage. “Master Yang, have you been bought off by Yu Huanhu? Or... are you one of his men all along? Could it be that you are the traitor who colluded with the outside, passed on information, and harmed the young master of the Yu family?”

Second Master Suo’s curly beard bristled, and killing intent flashed in his eyes as he spoke, stepping closer and closer to Yang Can.

Seeing this, Suo Chanzhi grew anxious. Her second uncle was a master of hard martial arts, and if a fight broke out, it would be uncontrollable...

Suo Chanzhi quickly rose from her chair and swiftly inserted herself between Suo Hong and Yang Can.

“Second Uncle, please don't be angry. Let Chanzhi ask him.”

Suo Chanzhi blocked Suo Hong and walked gracefully toward Yang Can.

At this moment, Suo Chanzhi wore a plain dress, resembling an apricot blossom on a branch after the rain, pure and gentle.

“Master Yang.”

“Young Mistress.”

“Does Master Yang perhaps believe that this concubine killed her late husband?”

Yang Can shook his head. “Young Mistress, this humble one believes that the Young Master's death bears heavy suspicion from the Suo family. However, although Young Mistress is a member of the Suo family, the Suo family consists of more than just the Young Mistress.”

Suo Hong roared in anger, “Then who among the Suo family are you talking about? Could it be this old man?”

“Second Uncle!”

Suo Chanzhi frowned and called out softly, stopping Suo Hong. She turned back to Yang Can. “Master Yang, you say the Suo family bears heavy suspicion. What is your basis for this?”

Yang Can said, “When two families are joined by marriage, the man marries and the woman is wed. Upon returning from the wedding procession, the focus should be on the husband's family. Yet, along the way, it was Tu Mamu who overstepped her authority in everything, deciding all matters with a single word. And it was precisely because of this that my Young Master lost his life rashly.”

Suo Chanzhi replied, “That only proves that Tu Mamu was negligent and made improper arrangements, allowing others to take advantage of the situation. How can you implicate the Suo family in a conspiracy?”

Suo Hong shouted loudly, “Exactly! That old hag Tu was killed too. Are you trying to slander her now?”

Yang Can said, “If Tu Mamu had not died, I would have thought my suspicions were unfounded. Precisely because Tu Mamu died, and in such a strange manner, I feel that members of the Suo family must have been involved.”

Suo Hong, enraged, wanted to rush forward and slap this babbling little thief to death.

Suo Chanzhi hurriedly blocked Suo Hong again. Yu Xinglong said, “Second Master Suo, please calm your anger. I certainly do not suspect your Suo family. However, my son was murdered, and there are many rumors. There are still many doubts that are unclear. It is better to let him explain everything clearly in front of everyone.”

Suo Hong gave Yu Xinglong a cold look and slowly sat back down, saying sarcastically, “Fine. Anyway, my Suo family's daughter has become a 'widow at the start of the journey' because of your Yu family! Even if you don't pursue this matter, my Suo family will not let it go. We must investigate this clearly and thoroughly.”

Yu Xinglong glanced at Yang Can and said in a deep voice, “Continue.”

Yang Can bowed slightly. “Yes.”

Yang Can looked at Suo Chanzhi and said seriously, “The bandits attacked suddenly, and their goal was wealth. But those bandits that day ignored the wealth and went straight for the center of the camp. After shooting the Young Master with an arrow, they immediately tried to break out. Isn't this suspicious? This shows that they were not only familiar with the layout of our camp but also recognized my Young Master. Their purpose in coming was solely for my Young Master. Fleeing with a bit of wealth was just to divert attention. Furthermore, although the guards in the camp were caught off guard, a mere hundred or so bandits could not have easily penetrated the center of the camp without an inside accomplice letting them through.”

Suo Chanzhi said, “Even if there was an inside accomplice, how can you be sure that this accomplice was from my Suo family?”

Yang Can said, “My Yu family guards were responsible for the outer perimeter defense. When the bandits attacked, our outer defense had no time to deploy. But what about the inner perimeter, which your Suo family was responsible for? When the bandits attacked, it is not strange that they left a single survivor. What is strange is that this very survivor knew who the mastermind behind this was? I ask, if this matter was truly ordered by the Second Master of my Yu family, would he allow a group of bandits to know clearly that he was the one pulling the strings? Precisely because of this testimony, it becomes difficult to justify.”

Yu Huanhu slightly narrowed his eyes, his gaze toward Yang Can filled with increasing appreciation.

Suo Chanzhi said coldly, “You have not yet explained why, precisely because Tu Mamu died, my Suo family is even more suspicious.”

Yang Can said, “If knowing who the mastermind was from the sole survivor is not considered very suspicious, then Tu Mamu's death can further prove it.”

Suo Chanzhi raised her willow eyebrows and questioned, “What do you mean by that?”

Yang Can said, “In my opinion, when the Young Master was attacked, it was Tu Mamu who leaked information to the bandits and created the opportunity, using the bandits' hands to harm the Young Master. Therefore, when I spoke to Steward Yi, saying that your Suo family was greatly related to the Young Master's death, Tu Mamu was silenced.”

Hearing his name mentioned, Yi She was terrified, afraid of being dragged into the mess again.

Fortunately, Second Master Suo laughed heartily upon hearing this. “Hahaha, it's simply absurd. I ask you, what benefit would my Suo family gain from doing this?”

Yang Can cupped his hands and asked, “May I ask Second Master Suo, what benefit did the Second Master of my Yu family gain from killing the Young Master?”

“That goes without saying! The struggle between the main line and the second line of the eldest branch of your Yu family is known to everyone in Longshang. He didn't want the main line of the eldest branch to grow stronger by marrying into my Suo family!”

Yang Can nodded and said calmly, “What Second Master Suo says makes a lot of sense. Then, does Second Master Suo think that your Suo family has anyone...”

Yang Can looked at Suo Chanzhi again. “Does your Suo family have anyone who does not want the Young Mistress's branch to grow stronger by marrying into my Yu family?”

As soon as these words were spoken, the entire Mingde Hall suddenly fell into a terrifying silence.

All along, everyone had found Yang Can's "accusations" ridiculous. Even Steward Yi only dragged him out to save himself. No one believed Yang Can's words, simply because... the Suo family had no motive to kill Yu Chengye.

But no one expected that Yang Can would have such a unique perspective.

The motive for the Suo family to kill was suddenly established!

Silence. Utter silence.

The Yu family is not a united block; could the Suo family be one? Not to mention a large family passed down for generations, even a common family with just two or three children might fight to the death over inheritance. The Suo family is even larger than the Yu family. Are the various branches of the Suo family on such good terms? Is there not a branch that cannot stand to see the branch of Suo Chanzhi doing well? Or even one that is in competition with them for interests?

With Yang Can's words, Yu Huanhu was no longer the sole suspect pointed at by a thousand fingers.

Yu Huanhu's gaze toward Yang Can became filled with even more admiration, even showing a hint of intimacy.

Yang Can's voice slowed down, but since the Mingde Hall was now silent as a graveyard, everyone still heard him clearly.

“Lord of the Clan, Second Master Suo,各位 heads of the branches, and各位 elders, please think for a moment. Is it possible that the captured bandit survivor is actually a 'dead soldier' thrown out by the true mastermind to frame someone?”

Although his voice was soft, it sounded like a thunderclap in Yu Xinglong's ears.

Even with Yu Xinglong's deep composure, his expression changed slightly. However, this was just because he was guilty; in reality, no one suspected him because of Yang Can's words. After all, the one who died was his own son, the son he had relied on most and raised with all his effort since childhood.

Yu Huanhu's eyes flashed. Seizing the opportunity, he stepped forward.

First, he let out a sorrowful laugh toward the sky, then pretended to be agitated and said loudly, “My elder brother has a steady temperament, while I, Yu Huanhu, am impulsive. Therefore, in managing the family business, Huanhu and my elder brother often had disagreements. However, although there were disputes between us brothers, to say that Huanhu coveted the position of Lord of the Clan and even went mad enough to murder my own nephew... that is absolutely impossible.”

Yu Huanhu slowly raised three fingers to the sky, his eyes red as he swore a vicious oath: “If I, Yu Huanhu, ordered the murder of my nephew Chengye, may heaven and earth condemn me! I, Yu Huanhu, shall die without a burial place, become a lonely ghost after death, and never enter the ancestral temple.”

With Yang Can's words and Yu Huanhu's vicious oath, the minds of the crowd wavered even more. Could it be that we were all wrong? This matter has nothing to do with Yu Huanhu?

Seeing this, Yu Xinglong had to stand up. “Second Brother, don't be agitated. How can you swear such a vicious oath! Elder brother... naturally believes you.”

Yu Huanhu did not accept his comfort, but pressed his advantage to counterattack. “Since that bandit insisted that I, Yu Huanhu, killed my own nephew, then, Elder Brother, just kill me! My nephew Chengye has not been gone long. I, his second uncle, can keep him company on the road to the Yellow Springs.”

Yu Xinglong roared, “Huanhu, stop talking nonsense! When did I ever say you were the murderer? It's just that there are many rumors, and you, Second Brother, have become a suspect. Once this matter is spread, will it only be your reputation that is ruined? That is why I must be cautious. I just want to investigate this matter clearly to clear your name!”

If possible, Yu Xinglong would have chopped Yu Huanhu into pieces on the spot. This Phoenix Mountain Manor was his territory. If he really wanted to kill Yu Huanhu, Yu Huanhu would have no way to escape. However, killing Yu Huanhu alone would not solve the problem at all. The second line of the eldest branch had already grown powerful. Yu Huanhu had come to Phoenix Mountain this time, leaving his eldest son, Yu Rui, to guard their nest in Dailai City. If Yu Xinglong killed Yu Huanhu, Yu Rui, stationed in Dailai City, would immediately rebel. Once the main line and the second line of the eldest branch started fighting, the other seven great clans would descend like a flock of vultures. The nearly three-hundred-year-old foundation of the Yu family would become a wedding gown for others.

Yu Huanhu also knew that his elder brother was indecisive. As the Lord of the Clan, bearing the responsibility for the entire Yu family, he would never dare to bear the serious consequences of killing him easily. However, what Yu Huanhu worried about was never that his elder brother would kill him, but rather... Now that he finally had a chance, how could Yu Huanhu not seize it?

Yu Huanhu immediately said, “Elder Brother, Second Master Suo keeps saying that I, Yu Huanhu, plotted treason because I coveted the position of Lord of the Clan. He doesn't know that Huanhu only pities Elder Brother for your weak health and wants to share your burdens. My sincere intentions have been met with such suspicion. Fine, fine! Since that's the case, then today, Huanhu will clarify his heart's intentions in front of everyone!”

Yu Huanhu's eyes turned red, and his lips trembled. If his elder brother could act, so could he. He would just act along.
