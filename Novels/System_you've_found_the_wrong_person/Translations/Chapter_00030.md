# Chapter 30: Misfortune Strikes

As the words "Gentleman's Sword" were uttered, the bustling tavern fell into sudden silence.

It was as if all sound had vanished from the world, with countless gazes turning toward Dou Changsheng.

The name "Gentleman's Sword" had become renowned throughout the land. If there was one topic dominating conversations in the Great Jin Dynasty recently, it was undoubtedly the Gentleman's Sword.

Emerging from Jun County, this swordsman had traversed the land alone, invincible in battle—never needing more than a single stroke to slay his foes. With one sword strike, he killed the Ironclad Lion King Wang Xiong, charged alone through a hundred cavalrymen, slew a Xiantian realm expert, and sent another fleeing in terror.

Twice entering Sword Pass, even a grandmaster from the Earth Ranking could do nothing but watch helplessly as the Gentleman's Sword flaunted his prowess, leaving behind the declaration: "A single sword dominates the world—this next decade belongs to Dou Changsheng."

The younger generation could only look up in awe. No tales of honor, righteousness, or chivalry could compare to the sensation of a grandmaster willingly serving as a stepping stone for his rise to fame.

The news had shaken the world, and countless were now intensely curious about this Gentleman's Sword, Dou Changsheng. Naturally, his sudden appearance drew everyone's attention.

Having spent his recent days focused solely on travel, Dou Changsheng had remained indifferent upon hearing about the "Gentleman's Sword." Had the visitor not mentioned his name, he might still be wondering who would adopt such a moniker. Now that he realized it referred to himself, his mood soured.

It was a fine title—if not for its unfortunate association with certain infamous figures.

Only after the visitor repeated his inquiry did Dou Changsheng respond, "What is it?"

The man replied, "My master awaits you in a private room on the second floor."

He added by way of explanation, "My master would have come personally, but circumstances prevent it. I must apologize on his behalf."

Aware of the many eyes upon him, Dou Changsheng knew the main hall was no longer suitable. He rose, gripping the Hero's Sword from the table, and commanded, "Lead the way."

Following the guide, he soon reached the second-floor chamber. Pushing open the door, he found a woman seated within.

She sat gracefully in a wicker chair, her beauty striking—though dressed in a pale yellow gown, she carried an androgynous air, resembling a handsome youth. A wooden hairpin held back her raven-black tresses. 

Smiling faintly at Dou Changsheng, she lifted a pale hand, gesturing for him to sit.

Dou Changsheng's gaze lingered briefly before she casually lifted part of her skirt, revealing that both legs ended at the knees—confirming her disability. This was no affectation; she truly had a physical limitation.

"I meant no offense," Dou Changsheng immediately apologized.

She shook her head lightly. "No need. To survive despite my shortcomings is fortune enough—why ask for more?"

"You must be wondering why I invited you here. I am Tang Qingyan of the Jiangdu Tang Clan in Southern Chen. By lineage, I share the same generation as Tang He, though I am older. This Hero's Sword was forged by my father, Tang Fangxiong."

Dou Changsheng promptly raised the sword with both hands, offering it forward. "Brother Tang left in haste last time and did not take the sword. Returning it to the Tang Clan is only right."

Tang Qingyan pushed it back. "This blade was gifted to you—a hero's sword for a hero. Its fame will spread far and wide because of you. If anything, our Tang Clan benefits from this exchange."

"A sharp sword is easy to find, but a legendary one is rare. Without a hero to wield it through earth-shaking events, how could it become renowned? When the Hero's Sword dominates the world, all will know the Jiangdu Tang Clan's mastery."

Such eloquence. Even knowing her words were partly flattery, Dou Changsheng couldn't help but feel pleased, as if sipping cool water on a scorching day.

Tang Qingyan poured him tea before continuing, "Before leaving the Great Jin, my younger brother Tang He instructed me to look after you should we meet. He said that though your acquaintance was brief, you shared mutual respect—like true brothers."

"As kin to Tang He, you are also my younger brother. With the Qingyang Spring's opening drawing all manner of opportunists to Three Yang Mountain, the situation grows chaotic. As your elder sister, I must offer some advice."

"Even if you fear no danger, dealing with nuisances can be troublesome."

Dou Changsheng took a sip of tea. "Please speak plainly, Sister Qingyan."

She adjusted her sleeve, revealing a slender wrist, and smiled. "Though the Qingyang Spring's opening is touted as open to all heroes, in truth, it's already claimed by noble clans, great sects, and royalty."

"Slots are predetermined—the competition merely determines ranking and shares. Your late inclusion displaced someone, and many are displeased. They eagerly await your arrival to settle scores."

"Since this involves junior disputes, so long as no lives are lost, none will intervene. Among them, Lin Daoqi of the Capital Lin Clan—the Mad Blade—leads the charge."

"The Capital Lin Clan and the Xiangzhou Wang Clan have long been at odds. Lin Daoqi, now the Lin Clan's rising star, seeks not the spring's waters but fame—using this event as a stepping stone to challenge the Human Ranking and rival talents across four nations."

"Then there's Chen Weiquan, a gifted official's son and one of the Capital's Ten Elites. But the true concern is the master of Three Yang Sect—Daoist Qingyang."

"Though Qingyang is a Divine Transformation grandmaster, it was under his domain that military payroll silver vanished after a landslide. The northern unrest began with this loss, escalating until border troops grew unstable, the Northern Garrison General was imprisoned, and crisis followed crisis."

"You came from the north to Three Yang Mountain under the pretense of the Qingyang Spring gathering, but your true mission must be investigating the stolen payroll. The Northern Garrison General's imprisonment shocked the realm."

"General Yu once showed me kindness I cannot ignore. I came to uncover the truth behind the silver's disappearance. Now, I propose we join forces to solve this case."

*Damn it, will this never end? I'm not Yu Yun's father!*
