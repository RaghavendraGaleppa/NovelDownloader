# Chapter 326: The Flame Sows the Golden Lotus, the Karma Fire Swallows the Evil Flame (1/2)

Whoosh—

The true fire transformed into a fire dragon, striking first and foremost against the soldiers on its own side.

Wherever the fire dragon passed, soldiers were instantly roasted into black shadows within the flames. They couldn't even let out a scream before their bones were burned into nothingness, and the weapons in their hands melted into molten iron.

The calamity beast's evil flame could even melt mountains and stones into green smoke. It could even ignite the souls of others. Legend had it that the calamity beast did not eat any food but fed on fire, and wherever it passed, a fire disaster was inevitable.

Living creatures burned to death by it would be devoured, forever falling into the Infernal Purgatory of Fire.

Even an Inner Scene expert, without special abilities to protect them, would not dare to touch it.

Let alone Li Mo, who, although empowered by the army formation, had not yet condensed an Inner Scene. His soul was still at the Five Orifices of Divine Observation.

"This fire is coming for me."

Li Mo, locked on by the flame dragon, felt a sudden realization in his heart.

"Ice Cube!"

Li Mo roared loudly.

On the city wall, that cold and ethereal figure seemed to tremble slightly, understanding the youth's intention. She bit her lips tightly, closed her eyes, and changed the formation of the army.

The black-scaled swimming dragon formed by the cavalry was still entangled with the giant snake statue with a human face. Meanwhile, Li Mo detached himself from the army formation!

Detached from the formation, how could a cultivator at the Divine Observation realm possibly roam freely within a great army?

But now, no other being could get close to him.

"He... isn't he running away?"

A leader of the Calamity Beast Tribe was stunned for a moment. The instant Li Mo left the formation, those who saw this scene subconsciously thought he wanted to escape the army and flee alone.

Several experts were preparing to intercept him.

But Li Mo actually went at it alone, charging straight towards the fire dragon!

"Little thing, you are seeking death yourself. The National Teacher cannot blame me for not leaving your body intact!"

The Calamity Beast Bronze Giant was overjoyed. If he devoured this小子's soul, he could take it into his stomach and interrogate it with the evil flame. There was no way he wouldn't extract the secrets from him. Even an iron man would not be able to withstand it.

Bang—

In an instant, Li Mo crashed into the fire dragon. The precious armor he wore flared with red light. He activated the Wondrous Method of the Karma Fire Red Lotus. Instead of being consumed by the flames, the light on his body grew brighter and brighter, shining dazzlingly like the sun.

His eyes seemed to be burning flames within the fire.

A divine body is impervious to fire and water!

The laughter of the Calamity Beast Bronze Giant was cut short.

It couldn't burn him away?

Even a physique of that level of strength, with its divine effects at the Divine Observation realm, shouldn't be enough to withstand the burning of the evil flame.

It probably never dreamed that someone would have jumped into a cauldron to refine pills, refining themselves together with the Nine Orifices Dragon-Tiger Golden Pill.

Not only his physical body, but his soul was not worn down by the evil flame in the slightest! On the contrary, it shone brilliantly within the fire!

"Their roots intertwine, their lives and fates firm, yet they can sow the golden lotus in the fire."

This mantra surfaced in Li Mo's heart.

It was the first line of the general principle of the Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method. This general principle was also preserved in the "Wondrous Method of the Karma Fire Red Lotus."

How could true gold fear fire?

The "Battle Secret of Defying the Heavens" speaks of overcoming the strong with the weak, relying on 'Will'!

How could his soul, which is now like this, be extinguished by a mere evil flame?

The red mysterious pill in his Dantian suddenly burst with light, becoming the main star among the Seven Stars.

A thin layer of flames spread out from his Dantian, burning the surrounding evil flame until it twisted and retreated.

At this moment.

The two types of flames entangled with each other, and the evil flame was continuously burned into nothingness by the other fire.

The Calamity Beast was greatly alarmed and wanted to withdraw the evil flame. However, that figure followed the fire dragon back without hesitation.

That figure, with both body and soul burning, flew into the mouth of the Calamity Beast Bronze Statue.

Everyone's hearts in the field rose to their throats.

The next second.

Whoosh—

The Calamity Beast Bronze Statue suddenly began to struggle, trying all sorts of methods to spit out the thing in its belly, but it was all to no avail. Gradually, the Karma Fire burned more and more fiercely inside it.

He who plays with fire must burn himself.

The Calamity Beast, which had caused calamities with its evil flame, was ultimately devoured by the firelight.

It began to burn.

Clang—

---

Clang—

Its belly bulged with hammer prints. After three consecutive hammer blows, it finally exploded.

A figure, with the firelight on his body not yet extinguished, rushed out.

The calamity beasts and warriors of the Calamity Beast Tribe did not dare to block him. For them, who worshipped fire, Li Mo burning the Calamity Beast to death was no less than a god in their hearts!

"Hero Li! Hero Li!"

"Charge, welcome Hero Li back to the formation!"

On the city wall, cheers rose to the sky, shaking the heavens.

Hero Li's life and death were now closely tied to the fate of every one of them. He was invincible on the battlefield. In the hearts of the soldiers, the scales of victory were always tilted in their favor.

He, as expected, never let anyone down.

On the city tower.

"Hu..."

Ying Bing looked at the youth who had charged out of the bronze giant and finally returned to her sight. She silently let out a breath of relief. While playing the zither, she once again directed the changes in the army formation.

The black-scaled swimming dragon welcomed its dragon head!

And the Greenwood Iron Cavalry, without exception, had momentum like a rainbow, their hearts set on piercing the enemy's core!

Even though the swimming dragon had lost its head, and many comrades had fallen in battle while fighting the giant statues and the enemy army, in their hearts at this moment, they all held an unwavering belief in victory.

"It's good that you're back, it's good that you're back."

Qu Sheng stroked his bulging white robe, the admiration in his smile growing stronger.

He could be certain that when Li Mo charged into the烈火, he did not know he would come out unscathed, yet he still stood in front of the soldiers.

To lead from the front is the true nature of one who can withstand ten thousand enemies.

Qu Sheng had been a commander for many years and had not charged into battle for a long time. But looking at the youthful spirit, he seemed to have found his younger self again.

How could he let down Greenwood City, or let down the Prince?

"Brothers, follow my charge, merge our forces with Hero Li's!"

Above the wall, the whistling of the Rongyuan military crossbows sounded again, instantly dividing the battlefield and leaving the enemy reinforcements from the rear in a momentary vacuum.

"Hero Li! My brothers will follow you from now on. Can you handle it?"

Qu Sheng managed to merge his troops with Li Mo's, his voice like thunder.

"I can handle it!"

Li Mo spat out a mouthful of turbid air that seemed to be burning, answering without looking back.

But then a hint of doubt surfaced in his heart.

The troops had followed him.

What about Commander Qu?

The battlefield had reached a fever pitch, becoming a true meat grinder. Every minute and second, lives were being crushed into mud.

They were getting closer.

The black-scaled swimming dragon, with Li Mo as its head, had already exceeded a hundred units and had become a sharp knife plunged into the enemy formation, determined to pierce right through it.

His fighting spirit grew even stronger.

A warrior capable of facing ten thousand enemies, with sufficient armor and weapons, had the qualifications to roam the battlefield.

"Could he really charge all the way to the central army?"

"That divine will..."

Han Zhen's arm had already completely turned into a bloody mess.

A cultivator at the Divine Observation realm had actually withstood the military might of a hundred units of soldiers.

Was he not getting tired?

What Han Zhen found even more incomprehensible was that divine will phantom.

That aura of battling the heavens and the earth, of wanting to pierce a hole even in the sky, was definitely not a mere form.

It was a Great Dao Divine Form.

It seemed to be a... monkey, wearing golden chainmail and holding an iron rod?

In his thousands of years of experience, he had never heard of such a thing.

Where did this Great Dao Divine Form come from?

It was precisely this divine form that made his fighting spirit soar to the heavens, growing braver the more he fought, transforming him into a warrior capable of facing ten thousand enemies.

"We must make preparations early."

Han Zhen muttered to himself, then shouted loudly:

"What are you all waiting for? Why aren't you making a move?"

"Whoever kills this小子, will stand at the forefront of the Bronze Tree thereafter! Enjoy the worship of all living beings from all directions!"

Boom—

The sound echoed.

Those calamity beasts that had entered the formation finally stopped watching.

A great reward invites brave men.

This is also true for these calamity beasts, who were once gods in their own right.
