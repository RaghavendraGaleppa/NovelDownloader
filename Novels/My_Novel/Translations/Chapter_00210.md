Chapter 210: Secrets of the Dragon Appreciation, Earthly Essence Appears

January 26.

A dragon's roar echoed from the mountains, sounding three times and shaking the land for miles.

The pond water was dark, cold, and deep.

In Dragon Claw Town, martial artists gathered like clouds, while strange hisses of serpents and flood dragons were heard. The noise was deafening, filled with endless discussions and indecisive plans. Among them were those with deep knowledge, familiar with many strange tales and oddities, who said:

"Hehe, everyone, this is the old dragon前辈 (Senior) selecting his troops! If we go and get washed by the water, we'll benefit immensely in the future!"

They set off together for the Old Dragon Pond.

Then, someone from the crowd shouted, "Everyone, don't all rush in at once! If we flood in together, won't we trample all the flowers, grass, and trees? Let's go in batches."

Martial artists are the hardest to control. How could they possibly line up in an orderly fashion and proceed with rules?

However, with everyone having different thoughts—the impatient, the steady, the observers waiting to see, and those fearing scams—batches naturally began to form.

The impatient ones took the lead, a dark mass of several hundred people.

About a hundred zhang from the pond.

The martial artists, fearing they might offend someone, all stopped in their tracks. After hesitating for a moment, one martial artist, slightly bolder in spirit, shouted clearly, "Old Dragon前辈, we have come to help you become a dragon! Are you selecting troops, or is there something else you need? Please tell us directly."

The pond water surged, ripples spreading as if a giant creature was stirring inside. Suddenly, with a "splash," water flew high into the air, drenching everyone.

Everyone was stunned. The hot-tempered ones were almost ready to curse. Suddenly, someone said, "I know, I know, this is soaking up dragon qi. When the Old Dragon前辈 takes to the water to become a dragon in the future, we will have bathed in the dragon soup and benefit immensely!"

Everyone's clothes were soaked, their faces filled with wild joy. They said, "Thank you, Senior, thank you Senior! We will surely do our best to help you stir the wind and waves! Hahaha!"

They left joyfully.

The heroes gathered to help the flood dragon take to the water.

Naturally, they had ulterior motives, driven by profit.

Only when interests align can one exert full effort!

Not long after, another group of martial artists arrived. They wore light clothing, their eyes filled with anticipation. Someone said, "Old Dragon前辈, we wish you a successful ascension to dragonhood in the future, soaring through the heavens and the earth, galloping across the universe!"

They followed the same procedure.

A dragon's roar came from the pond. A splash of pond water flew out, and under the sunlight, a dazzling rainbow appeared. As it sprinkled over their bodies, all who came beamed with joy.

This happened several more times with different groups of heroes. All of them were drenched.

Outside the pond, it was a scene of jubilation and excitement, with endless congratulations and well-wishes. Most were to the effect of congratulations on ascending the Dragon Gate, longevity like the southern mountains, a dragon's posture and phoenix's appearance, or choosing a day to become a dragon...

By noon, most of the heroes attending the banquet in Dragon Claw Town had already bathed in the "pond water" and soaked up the dragon qi.

The pond fell silent again, but the visits were far from over; the main event was just beginning. In the following days, the guests in the second-floor seats, third-floor high seats, top-floor guest rooms, and private boxes of the Wangzhen Tower...

Would be selected by time to visit the Old Dragon alone. There might be golden rain falling, special grants of opportunity, observation of the dragon's body, or discussions of transactions.

Those who came to appreciate the dragon all had their own schemes and plans. The specific details were never revealed.

At dusk.

The setting sun slanted, casting a golden sheen over the pond's surface. The grass and trees were full of vitality.

In the high seats on the third floor of the Wangzhen Tower, the martial arts expert 'Golden Blade Earth Flood Dragon·Zhu Butong' came to pay a visit alone.

He carried a golden blade on his back, his stature tall and imposing. Standing by the pond, he said, "Zhu Butong has come to visit, Old Dragon前辈." As his words fell, the pond water surged, and splashes of water flew towards him.

Zhu Butong snorted coldly, his golden blade dancing, tightly guarding his entire body.

Though the splashes were dense, they could not touch the corner of his clothes.

His blade work was astonishing.

He plunged his blade into the ground, shaking the earth around him, and said in a clear voice, "Old Dragon前辈, I, Zhu, have come from afar. Is this not enough to exchange for a single scale?"

There was no response.

Zhu Butong said, "Alright, if the Old Dragon前辈 looks down on me so, then I shall let the Old Dragon前辈 know my prowess!" He immediately executed his blade technique, golden light swirling, the blade's radiance dazzling...

Suddenly, a rising slash, the flying dragon in the sky.

Suddenly, a downward劈 (chop), the flood dragon entering the sea.

This was the "Golden Flood Dragon Fifteen Blades," an extremely powerful mid-tier martial art. Zhu Butong displayed his strength to increase his bargaining chips.

A moment later. From the depths of the pond, a single scale shot out. Zhu Butong sucked it into his hand from a distance. The flood dragon scale was tough and cool to the touch.

He said joyfully, "Thank you, Old Dragon前辈. I wish the Senior a successful ascension to dragonhood!"

He stored the scale and left happily.

The truth was...

The Dragon Appreciation Banquet was an exchange of interests.

The flood dragon taking to the water desired to become a flying dragon.

It had to face the three great trials of Heaven, Earth, and Man. It was a convergence of the world's brilliance, a gathering of a region's luck, and a collection of human talent's splendor.

If it succeeded in taking to the water, there would be a resonance between heaven and earth, a magnificent display of brilliance, and a 'Heavenly Bestowal of Blessing'.

Those who helped the flood dragon reach the sea would all receive a share.

Those who bathed in the pond water would have their lifespan extended, their bodies strengthened, and their luck enhanced. The immense benefits are too numerous to list.

Those who obtained a flood dragon scale, when the Heavenly Bestowal occurred, the scale would transform into a part of the 'Dragon's Shedding', a human-grade Yellow Treasure!

The Dragon's Shedding refers to the scales shed by the flood dragon, which, after traveling ten thousand miles of waterways and entering the sea to become a dragon, with Heaven's permission, transform into the Dragon's Shedding.

Thus, as night fell.

A waning moon hung high, reflected in the pond.

The pond water was like a mirror, reflecting the night sky. By the pond stood a robust, ancient tree with dense leaves and many branches. Its reflection in the water looked like a silver tree hanging the moon.

Mist rose, making it seem like a fairyland.

It was no longer lively at night. Monkeys slept on the treetops, and fish played in the pond.

Outside the Old Dragon Pond, Li Xian and Wen Caishang walked over slowly.

Reaching the pond's edge, Wen Caishang said softly, "Old Dragon前辈, for your upcoming ascension, Caishang has come to assist."

A flood dragon scale floated out of the pond water. The scale was a light green color with golden thread-like patterns inside. Wen Caishang shook her head and said, "Old Dragon前辈, please come out and meet."

Water surged, and a massive flood dragon's body swam out from the bottom of the pond. The flood dragon was covered in green scales, its body enormous. It had already grown hands, claws, and horns...

Li Xian scrutinized it carefully, thinking to himself: 'Horns on its head, claws on its belly. It has shed its snake-like appearance. Since my past life, I have heard legends of dragons. I never thought I would see one now. It's slightly different from my imagination, a mix of fishy and fragrant smells.'

Wen Caishang said, "Senior, please grant me your heart's blood to splash upon this scale. Caishang will surely do her utmost to help you reach the sea."

"Wen Caishang..." The flood dragon opened its mouth, surprisingly able to speak the human language: "You are too greedy. I granted you the heart scale, which is the only one of its kind. To splash it with heart's blood again, what use would that be?"

Wen Caishang said calmly, "Senior, you need to understand. If you fail to take to the water, this heart scale is nothing more than a slightly tougher snake scale. Though it has some effect, it is ultimately an ordinary object."

"If you succeed in taking to the water, strictly speaking, that Earthly Treasure is not granted by you, but by the permission of Heaven."

"Heavenly Essence and Earthly Essence are both obtained from Heaven and Earth. Even a true dragon, are its scales treasures? If that were the case, how could dragons exist in the world? Wouldn't martial artists have hunted them all to extinction?"

"Senior, you must know that even if you successfully become a dragon. Your scales become the Dragon's Shedding, this treasure is related to you, but not granted by you."

"If Senior hides your strength, then Caishang will naturally hide mine. In the end, Caishang will merely lose a treasure, but Senior will lose your life."

The flood dragon swam in the pond, thinking: 'The heart scale is already the limit. In the future, when the Heavenly Dragon's Shedding falls, the one holding the heart scale will get a unique two-tenths share. She now asks me to use blood to water it. Could it... involve the Earthly Essence?' A vague感应 (sensing) came to its heart, and it said, "Your scheme is great. Do you desire the Earthly Essence?"

Wen Caishang did not answer.

"You are correct. The treasures of Heaven and Earth are not granted by me. The Old Dragon here only decides how to distribute them. Since that is the case, I hope you will do your best." The flood dragon vomited its heart's blood, dripping it onto that 'heart scale'.

It smelled both fishy and fragrant.

The flood dragon said, "Heaven and Earth are vast, with their own principles. I wish to become a dragon, and Heaven sends down layers of obstructions. Yet, it gives me a lifetime of chips to distribute myself, to form a group of friends for my ascension. Now, the final chip is in your hands. I hope you will do your best to help me."

"As it should be," Wen Caishang smiled. "Furthermore... Old Dragon前辈, please grant him a bath."

The flood dragon stretched its head over, examined Li Xian, sniffed his scent, and said, "Young man... your aura is very unique."

Li Xian cupped his fists and asked, "How is it unique?"

"Very fragrant," the flood dragon laughed.

Wen Caishang said, "He also has a Perfect Physique, his body naturally emits a pure fragrance. It is only normal."

"Wen Caishang, to have such a fine son-in-law, your luck is quite good," the flood dragon said. It flicked its tail, splashing pond water into the air, which rained down on Li Xian. He immediately felt a refreshing coolness.

Li Xian was startled. Wen Caishang said calmly, "The dragon's nature is inherently lustful. Though it has not yet become a dragon, it already possesses that nature. It judges others by itself. You need not pay it any mind."

...

Back at their residence.

The incense in the room had not yet burned out, its scent calming the mind and spirit.

Li Xian asked directly, "Madam, you spoke at length with the Old Dragon前辈 just now, but I only understood half of it. Could you please explain it to me again?"

Wen Caishang brought out the Heaven and Earth Treasure Box. It was the size of a palm, even more exquisite. She stored the blood-stained heart scale inside, put it away in her sleeve, and sat down calmly, saying, "What do you wish to know?"

"This talk of true dragons and treasures, I really don't understand," Li Xian said, his heart filled with curiosity.

During the day, he saw the heroes in high spirits, returning with soaked bodies as if they had enjoyed a sweet dew. He thought the Old Dragon had granted them opportunities. However, when he personally bathed, the pond water was foul-smelling and cold.

If it were the height of summer, soaking in it to dispel the heat would be fine. But there was no divine or miraculous effect, so why were the heroes so excited?

Wen Caishang explained, "A flood dragon taking to the water is a great event for Heaven and Earth. Opportunities from Heaven and Earth are often hidden in such great events. Otherwise, why would the heroes from the Yunan and Longxiong Dao come here just for the excitement?"

Li Xian thought to himself with a wry smile: 'I naturally know that without significant profit, Madam, you wouldn't deign to come.' He then thought: 'If I said that out loud, I'd probably get a couple of sword strikes.'

Wen Caishang was in a very good mood and continued, "When a flood dragon takes to the water, there are two great opportunities from Heaven and Earth. The first is bathing in the dragon soup and soaking up the dragon qi. One's bones, lifespan, talent, and luck... can all be enhanced."

"Furthermore... in this world, some powerful martial arts related to dragons. Those who have soaked up dragon qi can practice them with greater affinity and stronger power."

"The second involves treasures."

"When the flood dragon succeeds, Heaven will bestow its essence, known as the 'Dragon's Shedding'. Those who hold its scales will naturally get a share of the Dragon's Shedding."

Li Xian asked, "And what about this 'Earthly Essence' you mentioned earlier..."

Wen Caishang thought: 'It wouldn't hurt to tell Li Xian about this.' She said, "This is a secret, known only to me. I can tell you, but once you know, you will find it hard to leave my side ever again. You are still young, and you might want to travel and explore in the future. Don't let a moment's curiosity block your path forward."

Li Xian said, "Please tell me, Madam."

"Alright," Wen Caishang's expression softened, and she said, "When a flood dragon takes to the water, it not only contains a Human-level Yellow Treasure. It also nurtures an 'Earthly Essence', named the 'Dragon Tread Grass', ranked fifty-ninth."

"The opportunity is here, but how to obtain it is not simple."

She briefly described the mystery within. Seeing that Li Xian's experience was still shallow, he didn't quite understand the principles. She didn't go into too much detail.

Wen Caishang said, "That's not all."

She walked to the window, pushed open the eastern window, and looked out. One could see the endlessly surging river. She pointed gently and said:

"This grand event of the flood dragon taking to the water."

"Those who help the dragon become one will enjoy the benefits. Those who hunt the dragon along the river will also reap great rewards. When the dragon takes to the water in the future, its path along the Flowering River will be fraught with danger."

"A flood dragon taking to the water can be considered an act against the heavens. Those who hunt the dragon follow the will of Heaven and Earth, suppressing the dragon in the river and stopping its ascension. They too can enjoy a Heavenly Bestowal, sharing a Human-level Yellow Treasure."

"If the flood dragon becomes a dragon, I can obtain the Earthly Essence."

"But..."

Li Xian asked, "But what?"

Wen Caishang remained silent. According to the clan's records, although this method could obtain the "Earthly Essence," it was not the orthodox way. It carried the meaning of "theft," so... in mild cases, one's fortune would be hindered, and in severe cases, it would invite disaster.

"A flood dragon taking to the water is a rare event, once in a hundred or two hundred years. This Dragon Tread Grass is an important part of my recipe, so I must do my best to obtain it. If my fortune is hindered, I can find a geomantic treasure land and lie low for a few years to avoid it," Wen Caishang thought to herself.
