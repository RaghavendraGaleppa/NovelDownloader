# Chapter 348: A Genius of Unparalleled Talent, a Wife’s Pride, and the Heroes of Past and Present—Only My Husband Stands Supreme

The ghostly entities are mysterious and difficult to explain clearly. However, based on my extensive reading of ancient history and miscellaneous texts, wherever ghosts breed, the terrain must be unique. It is either shrouded in Yin energy or possesses a distinct topography. These ghosts also possess regional characteristics and are not easily relocated.

"If there truly is the 'Impure Garment' you speak of, it can hide ghosts within one's embrace and turn them to one's own use. Its power is secondary; its inscrutable and unpredictable nature is the true difficulty to guard against. But this is entirely speculation, and I cannot say for certain. Throughout history, methods to suppress and control ghosts have existed, but methods to absorb and command them are extremely rare."

She secretly pondered, guessing that Li Xian might possess a second Impure Garment, and that it involved the powers of gods and ghosts. She feigned a calm expression, but her heart was churning with shock and astonishment. The "Perfect Physique" and "Heavy Pupil Physique" were already peerless; adding to that the "Pure Gang Qi Robe" and the mysterious Impure Garment, combining all these abilities, his future potential was hard to imagine. Her heart swelled with indescribable pride. Looking through the history of past and present, countless geniuses and heroes have emerged... yet standing beside her little husband, they all lose their luster. To have such a husband sharing intimate nights with her, skin against skin, was an incredible stroke of fortune. Not to mention his talent, his diligence, hard work, and comprehension were all excellent. To have found this husband was truly the will of fate. Yet, thinking of his virtues inevitably made her think of his flaws. For a moment, love and hate intertwined, and emotions of affection, anger, and vexation swirled around her.

Li Xian, however, seemed lost in thought. "What you say makes sense, but there is too little information on this path, and it remains mere speculation. If there is a chance, I might try it."

Having finished discussing the matters of the Impure Garment, Li Xian put away the jade table and lay down on the couch. He wrapped his right arm around Wen Caishang, leisurely enjoying the snow. He rarely had such peaceful moments in his life and cherished every second.

Wen Caishang, trapped in her predicament, found this moment unforgettable. She rested her head against Li Xian's chest, wishing she could possess his heart, to swallow it whole in one bite. Suddenly, she bit down hard.

"Ouch!" Li Xian cried out in pain. "How dare you, Wen Caishang? In this state, you still dare to resist?" He then playfully teased her again, and a chorus of娇 laughter, scolding, and begging for mercy ensued.

Hugging her like a pillow, the night deepened in a flash. Li Xian gently stroked Wen Caishang's hair, wrapping his arm around her waist, massaging her feet, playing with her hair, rubbing her shoulders...

Wen Caishang felt that Li Xian's feelings for her were a mix of desire, love, and fear, filled with endless curiosity. She was delighted in her heart; this beautiful body of hers was meant for this purpose. She was even willing to show it off, but on the surface, she嗔ted, "You little brat, fumbling around randomly. How am I supposed to sleep?"

Li Xian said, "My Lady, please sleep."

The night passed sweetly. The next morning, birds chirped to greet the dawn, and fish played in the lake. The Yin and Yang energies gathered over the snowy lake, summoning an alternation of warmth and heat, which actually caused many flowers and plants to sprout. Clusters here and there, in a riot of colors, growing extremely lush.

Sunlight slanted into the valley, making the surroundings vivid and clear. People in the world suffer, rarely having a few moments of peaceful sleep. The closer the parting, the harder it is to let go, and the more one cherishes the time.

Wen Caishang was exhausted from the previous night, only falling asleep around the hour of Mao (5-7 a.m.), and was now in a deep slumber. She was gentle yet fierce in nature. In her sleep, her moth-like eyebrows slightly arched, as if she were once again commanding the world, breaking swords and hearts with a smile. After waking up, Li Xian helped her cover her with the quilt. He closed the four walls of the carriage, restoring it to its original form to defend against external attacks.

Li Xian thought: "Although my Lady won't shout and cause a ruckus, it's better to keep her mouth blocked. Her abilities are extremely strong. Even without cultivation, with just one finger, picking up fine gravel, she could use the 'Flower-Picking Finger' to catch people off guard. I must not be careless. She is in my hands, so she naturally begs for mercy repeatedly. But if I were in her hands, I wouldn't even have the chance to beg for mercy."

He executed the "Returning Cloud Bringing Joy" move from the "Cloud-Chasing Hand." Although the Cloud-Chasing Hand is a basic martial art, it focuses on "throwing," "casting," "striking," and "stealing." The previous move, "Exploring Cloud to Take Mist," is fast and light, capable of extracting a wisp of white smoke from a cloud of black fog while keeping the white smoke lingering and unscattered. The "Returning Cloud Bringing Joy" move is the exact opposite, returning an item lightly and skillfully to someone else.

Stealing things and taking wealth, then returning things and wealth—a back-and-forth. Now used here, while Wen Caishang was still sound asleep, two jade walnuts were already placed in her mouth. Influenced by the Yin-Yang Sword Momentum, she was bound by countless silken clothes, restraints, and ropes, unable to move a single inch. Moreover, knowing that Li Xian wouldn't hurt her, she enjoyed an unusually comfortable sleep. Her vigilance was extremely low, and she didn't even notice.

Li Xian smelled a faint fragrance and picked up the fallen golden hairpin, placing it beside the jade table. He searched inside the carriage, found some silver, and then quietly stepped out. Seeing that it was still early, he wandered around the forest, observing the terrain and paths. There were no snow wolves, snow tigers, or snow bears, but there were long-tailed cats, foxes, and other small beasts preying on birds and animals in the forest.

The small beasts were cunning and had sharp claws.

Li Xian wanted to drive them away. He ran further and captured a tiger beast alive. He took its tiger urine and sprinkled it around the snowy lake. The foxes and long-tailed cats would naturally be scared away. The tiger beast was then released back into the distant mountains.

It took about half an hour. Li Xian had thoroughly investigated the surroundings and secretly thought: "Without a guide, it would be difficult for anyone to reach this place even in a hundred years. The elders of the Five Mountains Sword Alliance, knowing the risks of the duel, chose this location carefully. They have indeed helped me."

Seeing that it was still early, Li Xian found an open space and practiced swordsmanship with the Green Sword. He warmed up his bones and blood with the "Setting Sun Waning Blood Sword," then switched to practicing the "Residual Demon Spear." "Residual Demon Playing in Water," "Residual Crow Defeating the Moon," "Hanging Corpse Upside Down," "Swift Wind Tenacious Grass"... He practiced over and over, tireless and unweary.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Residual Demon Spear\]

\[Proficiency: 7122/35000 (Perfected)\]

\[Description: The spear strikes like a ghost, the Residual Demon displays its might. Stirring ghostly energy, overturning clouds and rain.\]

Since arriving at Feilong City, Li Xian had neglected the practice of the Residual Demon Spear. However, fighting deadly battles with strong enemies had deepened his understanding of the spear techniques. Now, practicing quietly, he applied his insights one by one to reality, verifying and consolidating them.

His progress was rapid. In just over half an hour, the Residual Demon Spear's proficiency had accumulated \[89\] points. He was diligent and tireless, full of energy, and practiced with great enthusiasm. Suddenly, he leaped and thrust, and the Ghost Python Spear, like a giant python pouncing, "pierced" through a tree trunk with a loud bang.

\[Proficiency +2\]

Silver light flowed along the spear shaft. The large tree cracked and fell, the cut smooth as if polished, showing the sharpness of the spear's edge. Li Xian retracted his spear and settled his stance, feeling very satisfied. "Although this spear technique is somewhat incomplete, its power is not shallow. Back when I fought Zheng Dechun, his martial arts evolution was strong, but his moves were not refined. And he was too impatient for success, willingly trying to exchange his life for mine, which was equivalent to courting death. Many of my powerful moves were left unused."

He paused, then executed the Residual Demon Spear again. At the same time, he focused his breath and unleashed the "Iron Copper Body." A dark luster burst from his entire body, and a faint layer of blue-red scales appeared on his skin surface. They seemed illusory yet real, and indeed existed. When attacked, the scales could resist a portion of the killing force.

In the past battle with Zheng Dechun, Li Xian had used the "Iron Copper Body" to block a fatal blow and vaguely sensed something unusual: the Iron Copper Body had become about thirty percent stronger. Now, practicing it again, the疑惑 in his heart was confirmed. It turned out that the basic martial art "Iron Copper Body" and the "Residual Demon Spear" had an implicit compatibility.

Li Xian had derived the "Ghost Entwining Body" characteristic from the Residual Demon Spear. Combined with the Iron Copper Body, it subtly transformed into a "Ghost Copper Body." However, although the two were compatible, it was entirely accidental, and the compatibility was not high.

By the time the sun was three poles high, the climate had warmed. The wind and snow of the previous night had already melted. Li Xian returned to the carriage and saw Wen Caishang sleeping soundly on the couch, seemingly having a nightmare. Her brows were slightly furrowed, she shook her head gently, and made "muffled" sounds. She found it hard to speak both in and out of the dream. He closed the carriage door and hurried to the nearby path, riding the white horse back to Feilong City.

At the government office. Lin Aoshan, Han Qingxiao, and Qu Baitong were discussing important matters. Li Xian came to visit, and the three greeted him with smiles. Han Qingxiao teased, "Brother Li, have you taken care of your wife?"

Li Xian smiled and said, "Naturally, she's been tamed to be completely obedient. I went out early in the morning, and she didn't dare to say a word more." Lin Aoshan playfully scratched her cheek and said, "Shameless, boasting. I think it's you who's been tamed completely. Who knows what conditions you promised to be let out. A young lad like you, not learning good things, learning to be a boy-toy."

Li Xian wasn't angry and said, "Whose boy-toy has such grandeur?" Qu Baitong laughed and said, "Last night, Li Xian said he would treat us. The time is almost up, have you prepared enough money? The three of us were suppressed by you for no reason last night, and we've discussed it; we'll double the payback at the dinner table."

Lin Aoshan rubbed her belly and said seriously, "For this meal, this young lady only ate some water yesterday and this morning. My fighting capacity is strong." Li Xian said, "Don't worry, don't worry, just eat to your heart's content. If you can finish the 'Worry-Free Tower,' I'll sell my pots and scrap iron to buy the Worry-Free Tower."

Han Qingxiao said heartily, "Brother Li is generous." Lin Aoshan said, "Anyone can boast. The Worry-Free Tower has already collapsed; only then do you dare to boast about it."

The group left together. Qu Baitong, wearing a mask, walked with them to a nearby tavern. Li Xian booked a private room, which was luxuriously decorated. In the center stood a round table for the Eight Immortals. In the middle of the table were rockeries, streams, and waterfalls, like a small world in the palm of his hand.

Li Xian told the waiter to serve one of each item on the menu. There were Yellow Fish Stuffed with Soup, Clear Soup Swallow's Nest, Heart of the Snowy Land, Dragon Flipping Ridge... Lin Aoshan, Han Qingxiao, and Qu Baitong had broad horizons. Seeing several dishes were extremely expensive, costing dozens to hundreds of taels, the expenditure was terrifying. They knew Li Xian was genuinely apologetic and was truly going to great lengths to express his sincerity.

Their favorable impression of Li Xian grew. Li Xian never put on a show of being rich; he ordered twelve dishes in total, using all the money he had saved and the money he had taken from his wife.

The dishes were served one by one, all excellent in color and flavor. Dishes like "Dragon Flipping Ridge" and "Heart of the Snowy Land" were specialties of Feilong City. The former was cooked with forty-eight rare treasures from the snow. The latter involved the hearts of snow bears, snow leopards, snow foxes, snow tigers... many beast hearts, nested according to size, and then simmered in a high soup.

None were ordinary items, showing that Li Xian was truly sparing no expense.

Li Xian cupped his hands and said, "Everyone, my funds are limited, so I can only order these. If there were more, we'd have to wait for next time."

Han Qingxiao said, "Brother Li, you're too polite! We said we'd eat you out of house and home, but we didn't mean to actually do it." Qu Baitong also said, "No need for more. If we can't finish it, the silver will be wasted, which is truly heartbreaking."

Lin Aoshan felt even more pained for Li Xian. She knew Li Xian's family background was ordinary. Even though his relationship with the折剑夫人 (Madam Broken Sword) was special, that wife controlled him strictly, and he didn't have the freedom to spend money as he pleased. Now, before the wine and meat, most of the money came from his own pocket, representing months of salary.

She whispered to Han Qingxiao, "Boss, should we secretly pay the bill?" Han Qingxiao didn't care, but wanted to tease Lin Aoshan, so he said, "You pay if you want. I'm not the ancestor of the Lin family. I don't have that much money."

Lin Aoshan glared and said, "You take seventy percent of the monthly salary, it should be about enough." Han Qingxiao pretended not to hear. Lin Aoshan cursed, "Stingy ghost! I'll do it then." She翻出 a small purse from her sleeve, about to secretly pay the bill.

Han Qingxiao grabbed her wrist and said with a smile, "Aoshan, Aoshan, last time I asked you to treat us to a meal, you refused at all costs. Why are you so proactive this time?"

Lin Aoshan's pretty face turned red, and she didn't answer, about to get up. Han Qingxiao said seriously, "Alright, why do you need to worry about this? You're underestimating this Brother Li too much. From last night's events, can't you see that this Brother Li plans things out and handles matters very astutely? At such a young age, to handle things this way, it's rare. It seems he learned a thing or two from the折剑夫人. Since he has arranged things this way, it's one, to show his determination to apologize, and two, to show that he values us. If you go to pay first, although your intention is good, it would be looking down on Brother Li."

Lin Aoshan thought it over carefully and realized it was true, so she happily accepted. Li Xian drank a few cups of wine as a self-penalty, then drank and ate heartily with everyone, creating a harmonious atmosphere. Li Xian was very curious about the affairs of the巡天司 (Patrolling Heaven Division), so he brought it up intentionally or unintentionally.

Han Qingxiao said, "Brother Li is truly a rare talent. If I had the ability, I would definitely pull you into the Patrolling Heaven Division. It would be much better than the Flower Cage Sect." Qu Baitong said, "Ah? Brother Li is from the Flower Cage Sect? How is that possible?"

Lin Aoshan said, "The Flower Cage Sect is mostly full of villains, but Little Li is definitely different. That's right, Little Li, you said there was a hidden story to this matter. How about you tell us in detail?" Li Xian smiled bitterly and said, "Speaking of this matter, it's quite convoluted. Since Aoshan wants to hear it, I'll just tell you directly." He then told the three how he entered the Flower Cage Sect, with some modifications.

Lin Aoshan, Qu Baitong, and Han Qingxiao understood and said, "So that's how it is." Although Li Xian had no intention of joining the Patrolling Heaven Division, he was very curious about the forces in the court, so he asked, "By the way, how does one join the Patrolling Heaven Division? I'm very curious about this."

Han Qingxiao, with a gentle and elegant demeanor, said slowly, "The Patrolling Heaven Division patrols the world on behalf of the heavens. In the past, when the Great Wu Dynasty was strong, a position in the Patrolling Heaven Division was hard to come by. Only the best of the best could get it. Now, the court is in chaos, and the national fortune is declining, but the Patrolling Heaven Division is still not to be underestimated. There are only two ways to enter the Patrolling Heaven Division."

"Inheritance and recommendation. Both Aoshan and I obtained our positions through inheritance, serving as 'Patrolling Heaven Officers,' which is a minor celestial official. Even though the national fortune is declining, we have some face to use when visiting various places, and when traveling in the Jianghu, we can stay in official residences. But we do not have the power to recommend."

"Only the next level up, the 'Lin Tian Official' (Facing Heaven Official), has the power to recommend. My cousin is at the level of a Lin Tian Official, but she is fiercely righteous and has a very straightforward personality. Knowing that Brother Li is from the Flower Cage Sect, she definitely wouldn't be able to coexist with you, let alone recommend you. She might even take your life."

Lin Aoshan said, "Ah, Han Boss... are you talking about that one..." Han Qingxiao nodded and said, "I haven't mentioned this matter specifically, but she is indeed my cousin. Although she is only a few months older than me, she is several times stronger than me. Her abilities and means are beyond my comparison."

Li Xian asked, "I see. I have a free and easy nature. Even without the Flower Cage Sect identity, I might not be used to staying in the Patrolling Heaven Division. By the way, the matter in Feilong City has been settled. How do you plan to arrange things?"

Discussing this matter, the three of them looked serious. Lin Aoshan said, "This matter is very difficult to handle. If the affairs of He Wentian were known by the city's great clans, it would likely cause another disturbance. We decided to transport him out of the city tonight. Qu Baitong will stay here, impersonate He Wentian, and stabilize the situation in the city."

Li Xian thought: "This move of swapping the sky and changing the sun is used very well. It both punishes the villain and stabilizes the situation in the city. By the time the city's noble families notice, the situation will have already changed dramatically." He said with regret, "In that case, we've met today but haven't had a chance to talk in detail before we have to part again. There are so many sights in Feilong City; I wanted to tour and appreciate them with you all!"

Lin Aoshan sighed longly, "Yes, there's no good way. Before, the situation was unclear, and for the sake of caution, we had no heart for sightseeing. Now that everything is settled, we have to leave for important matters." Han Qingxiao cupped his hands and said, "Aoshan and I originally wanted to take this opportunity to bid farewell to Brother Li along the way. After this banquet, we must part."

Lin Aoshan sighed softly, "Parting in the Jianghu, I don't know when we can meet again. Alas."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Fate will bring us together again." Lin Aoshan casually said, "What if there is no fate?" Li Xian casually said, "If I really miss you, it's not impossible to come find you. But by then, I'm afraid I won't be able to afford such a good table of wine and food."

Lin Aoshan's mood improved slightly, and she smiled, "If you come find me, naturally I'll treat you. I'm just afraid that you, this flower thief, will go capture some girl and get caught yourself, beaten to death together."

"If that's the case, why not capture me back. It would at least count as a merit."

Li Xian said, "Alright, so that's your plan." Lin Aoshan deliberately said fiercely, "Of course, I specialize in catching little thieves like you. When you see me in the future, you have to obediently call me 'Grandma' three times. Otherwise, I'll have someone catch you."

Li Xian laughed, "Coincidentally, I specialize in capturing beautiful women like you. I wonder who is more skilled."

The three ate and drank their fill. Qu Baitong took his leave first. Lin Aoshan and Han Qingxiao gathered the government guards, put He Wentian in a prison cart, and escorted him out of the city together. Li Xian watched them leave from afar. After the two were far away, he felt a sense of emotion: "The Jianghu is a place of meetings and partings. Although the city is still bustling, seeing the sword sect leave and Aoshan leave, it inevitably adds a sense of desolation. I somewhat miss the lively scene back then."

He wandered around the city. His senses detected that his wife had already woken up, but she couldn't move an inch. Struggling was useless, but she was restless, trying to use objects to break the ropes. However, how could she not know how tough the Green Silkworm Rope was? She eventually gave up resistance, feeling extremely bored, and let out a muffled, angry hum. The "muffled" sounds seemed to be cursing Li Xian. Li Xian knew he was about to leave and cherished this peaceful time. After buying the ingredients and materials, he rode back to the Snow-Secluded Mountain.

Leaving the horse on the mountain path, he quickly ran back to the snowy lake. Pushing open the carriage door, a wave of heat rushed towards him. He saw his wife's face flushed pink, covered in fragrant sweat. It turned out that Li Xian, fearing that Wen Caishang would catch a cold, had added two yellow jade fragrant coals before leaving. Today, the temperature had warmed up, and the carriage was sealed, making it stuffy and hot.

Wen Caishang had also kept covering herself with quilts. She couldn't kick with her feet or hold with her hands, so she just kept them on, enduring the heat.

When Wen Caishang saw Li Xian, she immediately gave him two fierce glares, thinking: "This little bastard went out early to fool around, making me suffer and wait, sweating all over. If someone didn't know, they'd think you wanted to heat me to death. When did you block my mouth, causing me to have that nightmare? How despicable!" Li Xian immediately took out the jade walnuts. Under the candlelight, the green walnuts looked even more lustrous.

Wen Caishang could speak again. A trace of crystal clearness remained at the corner of her mouth. After calming her breath, she gave him a white-eyed glare and said through gritted teeth, "You little bastard!" Li Xian chuckled, "My Lady, don't be angry. I ran into He Wentian!"

Wen Caishang was startled and said, "He Wentian? What happened to him? If he discovers you, you'll be in danger. Quickly untie me, I can protect you." Li Xian said, "My Lady, don't be anxious. Why don't you take a guess?"

Wen Caishang said, "If the Five Mountains Sword Alliance is unharmed, it must be that He Wentian was defeated, and his end must be miserable. And there's no disturbance in the city, no troop movements, no heightened security, no actions from the noble families. He Wentian's matter should not have been leaked; the common people and noble families in the city don't know. If my guess is correct, he should have been secretly controlled." Saying this, her pretty face flushed, thinking of her own situation.

Li Xian praised, "My Lady is perceptive. It's not far from what you guessed. At that time, Feilong City was in chaos. Besides the Five Mountains Sword Alliance and the Flower Cage Sect, there were also figures from the Patrolling Heaven Division. They suspected that Feilong City had changed, so they secretly潜入 to investigate. Later, the Five Mountains Sword Alliance handed He Wentian over to the Patrolling Heaven Division for disposal."

Wen Caishang understood, "I had a vague guess early on that He Wentian might be planning to rise up and cause trouble." Li Xian said, "My Lady is wise, please enlighten me."

Wen Caishang gave him a resentful glare and said slowly, "He built a good reputation, befriended Jianghu friends, and set up the Worry-Free Tower. If it wasn't for his innate benevolence, then he harbored a great scheme... The most critical point is that in the past, the Great Yu Dynasty's national fortune was in decline, similar to the current Great Wu. At that time, a remote city-state also rose up. This matter plagued the Great Yu for a long time. If it couldn't be resolved quickly, the heroes of the world would imitate it countless times. How could the world be stable? The fall of the Great Yu would be imminent. If they wanted to resolve it quickly, the two places were far apart, and sending troops to conquer would cost countless resources, which was undoubtedly adding insult to injury. Moreover, that city-state was easy to defend and hard to attack. If it couldn't be taken down for a while, it would only boost its prestige, making it a dilemma to advance or retreat. I guess He Wentian wanted to emulate that person." She paused and then said, "But saying this now, it's easy to be accused of hindsight. If he hadn't shown his claws, it would just be speculation."

Li Xian crawled into the quilt and hugged Wen Caishang, asking, "And then?" Wen Caishang smiled and said, "The Great Yu Dynasty was already weak at the time. They forcibly sent troops to conquer but couldn't achieve a great victory. The national strength plummeted. The heroes saw an opportunity and纷纷划地起势, and the world fell into chaos."

Li Xian said, "If the Great Yu hadn't sent troops, they might have lasted longer." Wen Caishang said, "Now it seems, you're not wrong. But back then, no one knew right from wrong." She sighed softly, "It's like when I had you serve as a commander back then; I never imagined there would be such a day. Ah... you little bastard, you're restless as soon as you come back."

Li Xian smiled, "Thank you for your favor, my Lady. I owe everything I have today to your cultivation. I will repay you well." Wen Caishang's face flushed with shame, and she sighed, "I have woven a cocoon to trap myself. And this is how you repay me. You... you..." She was too ashamed to speak, but swallowed her words.

After Li Xian told Wen Caishang everything that happened in the city, he continued, "That Zhai Xing Division is very formidable. Qu Baitong disguised himself as He Wentian. Even I couldn't tell." Wen Caishang said, "The Great Wu's Zhai Xing Division is indeed an extremely mysterious force. If I'm not mistaken, its predecessor should be the Star Cloud Palace."

Li Xian was stunned and asked, "Star Cloud Palace?"

In the past, the Pure Yang Lay存放 the "Essential Treasure·Sky Kui" in the Star Cloud Palace.
