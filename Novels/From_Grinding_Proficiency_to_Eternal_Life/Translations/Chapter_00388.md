Chapter 1: The Desolate Ancient Era

In the desolate ancient era, the heavens and earth were chaotic, and the laws of the great dao were incomplete. The world was a vast wilderness, with fierce beasts and demons rampant, and the strong devoured the weak. In this brutal world, only the strong could stand at the top of the food chain and look down upon the world.

At the edge of the vast wilderness, there was a small village named Stone Village. The villagers lived a simple life, farming and hunting, and were content with their lot. However, the peace was often broken by the occasional appearance of powerful beasts, causing panic among the villagers.

In Stone Village, there was a young boy named Shi Hao. He was born with a broken dantian and could not cultivate. He was often bullied by other children in the village. Despite this, Shi Hao was not discouraged. He believed that as long as he worked hard, he could find a way to break through his innate limitations.

One day, while hunting in the deep mountains, Shi Hao encountered a mysterious old man. The old man had white hair and a youthful face, and his eyes were as deep as the stars. He saw Shi Hao's determination and decided to take him as a perfect disciple.

Under the guidance of the old man, Shi Hao began his journey of cultivation. He learned that the world's spiritual energy was abundant, and there were countless cultivation methods. He also learned that the broken dantian was not a dead end; there were other ways to cultivate.

The old man taught Shi Hao a unique cultivation method called "The Great Desolate Scripture." This scripture was extremely ancient and could cultivate the body and spirit simultaneously. It was said that if one could master it, they could dominate the world.

With the help of the old man, Shi Hao's cultivation progressed rapidly. He broke through the limitations of his broken dantian and reached the Spirit Spring Realm. He could now absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to temper his body and spirit.

However, the path of cultivation was not smooth. Shi Hao encountered many powerful enemies and dangerous situations. But every time, he relied on his strong will and the Great Desolate Scripture to overcome difficulties and become stronger.

As time passed, Shi Hao grew from a weak boy into a powerful cultivator. He began to understand the true meaning of cultivation: it was not just about becoming stronger, but also about protecting loved ones and maintaining justice.

In the end, Shi Hao stood at theDesolate Ancient Era's pinnacle, looking down upon the world. He became a legend, and his story was passed down through the ages.
