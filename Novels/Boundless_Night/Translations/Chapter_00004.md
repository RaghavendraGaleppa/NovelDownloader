# Chapter 4: The Snatch

Qin Ming withdrew his gaze, hoisted the beast-skin bag onto his back, and headed back along the path he had come. His harvest today was substantial, and he was quite satisfied. With this more than half-full bag of food, he wouldn't have to worry about hunger for a while. The path was difficult, with depressions and rocks hidden beneath the snow, but Qin Ming was in good spirits. With ample food, he had no more worries; perhaps consistent practice of those specific exercises would lead to new breakthroughs. He also looked forward to the arrival of early spring, a season brimming with vitality. Though currently surrounded by ice and snow, with plants and trees withered and all things dormant, a different scene would emerge once the dormant period passed. Fire springs in the perilous mountain zones would erupt, and earth light would frequently emanate, causing vegetation to sprout and all life to revive.

As he approached the edge of the dense forest, Qin Ming abruptly stopped. He tossed aside his beast-skin bag, gripping his hunting spear tightly with both hands, and spun around. In the darkness, a pair of chilling crimson eyes appeared, rapidly closing in. His hair stood on end. Though still distant, he could sense that the creature trailing him was large and extremely fierce; a腥味 (fishy/bloody smell) drifted over with the cold wind. He plunged his hunting spear into the snow and quickly drew his bow and arrow. His arm strength was astonishing; he instantly drew the hard bow—difficult for an ordinary person to use—to a full moon, and a powerful iron arrow shot forth, the twang of the bowstring echoing loudly. In the distance, the creature, charging with a savage aura, suddenly paused, apparently struck by an arrow. Qin Ming remained highly focused, drawing his bow repeatedly, displaying his superb archery skills. One lethal iron arrow after another vanished into the night. A dull growl emanated from the dense woods, and the crimson eyes disappeared. Accompanied by the sound of snapping twigs, the creature hid behind the trees. Qin Ming dared not relax; though the unknown dangerous creature was injured, it wasn't fatally wounded, and it would become even more perilous lurking within the forest.

Without hesitation, he grabbed his beast-skin bag and hunting spear and swiftly burst out of the forest, onto the open snowy ground. He didn't want to remain in the dim environment, fearing a sneak attack; he suspected it was a troublesome mutated creature. Considerable movement came from the woods, with sounds of snow being violently disturbed, indicating that the creature was fiercely pursuing him. Qin Ming drew his bow without hesitation. Some iron arrows thudded into thick tree trunks, shaking the entire tree until snow cascaded down like a waterfall. The creature was forced back again, its presence vanishing into the forest. An ordinary beast would either be scared away or, due to injury, would charge in a fit of rage. However, this mutated creature was lingering in the shadows, biding its time and seeking an opportunity.

Qin Ming stood holding his bow and arrow, facing the dense forest, confronting the dangerous creature. The snow on the ground churned, and a large, dark shadow flickered several times within the woods. Its chilling crimson eyes were exceptionally oppressive in the night. Yet, in the end, it was still deterred by Qin Ming's astonishingly powerful arrows, letting out a reluctant, low growl before disappearing into the dense forest. Qin Ming's expression was grim. Although the forest was dark, he could tell that it was a bipedal figure capable of running upright; he didn't know what kind of mutated creature it was. He slowly retreated. There was no movement in the surroundings, but he never lowered his guard. He remained vigilant until he was less than a *li* (approx. 0.5 km) from the fire spring at the village entrance. Past generations had learned bloody lessons: villagers, nearly at the village entrance, had relaxed their guard only to be ambushed, killed, and silently dragged away by unknown creatures trailing them in the darkness.

Outside Twin Tree Village, three young men shivered from the cold, stamping their feet and rubbing their hands, exhaling large plumes of white mist, their eyebrows frosted with ice. They waited on the snowy path Qin Ming had trodden when he entered the pitch-black region, conversing in low voices. "It's torture waiting out here in this freezing weather. If it's too much, let's just leave. I bet he'll die in the wilderness and won't bring back any prey." "What's the hurry? What if he's as lucky as Old Man Li and finds a frozen mountain beast in the outer forest?" These three were usually idle and lazy, not daring to venture into the dangerous mountain zones. However, they were quite assertive within the village, fond of scrounging for food and drinks. Knowing Qin Ming had left the village to hunt, they hatched a wicked plan: to wait here and poach his catch.

"That kid Qin Ming is agile and very strong. Let's not mess up here and end up getting dealt with by him instead." "What's there to be afraid of? He's just recovered from a serious illness, so he must be weak. We'll just throw the beast-skin bag over his head later, and be careful not to actually kill him when we strike." While they intended to commit mischief, they didn't have the guts to kill anyone; they merely wanted to ambush him from behind and secretly seize the prey Qin Ming brought back. All along the way, Qin Ming had been vigilant, his nerves taut. His eyesight was sharp; he had spotted the three dark figures from a distance. He immediately crouched down. The snow on the ground was already almost shoulder-high for him, and now he vanished completely. He silently crept along the snowy path he had previously cleared, finally identifying the figures ahead as the three village loafers. Qin Ming stopped at a suitable spot, able to hear their conversation. Moments later, his expression darkened. These three actually planned to ambush him here and steal his prey? Though he hadn't hunted a bear, only raided a squirrel's nest—which wasn't particularly "glorious" to boast about—he had genuinely experienced two life-or-death crises, attacked first by a human-faced vulture and then by an unknown mutated creature. The slightest carelessness would have meant death. He could not tolerate such poaching of food he had risked his life for.

Hu Yong, Ma Yang, and Wang Youping, shivering from the cold, worked together to dig a snow pit that could block the frigid wind, effectively setting up an early ambush. They huddled inside, waiting for Qin Ming. They had assumed Qin Ming would risk hunting deep in the forest, miscalculating his return time; otherwise, they wouldn't have chatted so carelessly just now. "Be careful. Don't make a sound later," Ma Yang said. Hu Yong nodded. "When you strike him from behind, be quick, accurate, and ruthless. Be swift!" Wang Youping complained, "I hope he comes back alive with some prey and shows up soon. I'm almost frozen stiff. Let's hurry and give him a few iron rod blows." Suddenly, the snow pit where they were hiding collapsed with a rumble, burying all three instantly. Caught off guard, their mouths and noses filled with snow. Hu Yong reacted the fastest, being the first to scramble out. However, before he could steady himself, a foot appeared before his eyes, and with a *thud*, it heavily kicked him in the face. The intense pain contorted his features. Then, a hunting spear violently struck his shoulder; he felt as if his bones were about to break, and he staggered and fell to the ground. Ma Yang was in a similar state; as soon as he poked his head out of the snow, Qin Ming kicked him in the nose. The agonizing, stinging pain was unbearable, making him let out a wail of misery, tears and snot streaming down his face as he rolled repeatedly in the snow.

Wang Youping heard the commotion and knew something was wrong, so he burrowed into the meter-deep snow, not daring to emerge. Then, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his back; the keen steel spear had pierced his clothes, drawing blood. "No... don't kill me!" His voice trembled, his lips quivered, and to his greater shame and embarrassment, he had wet himself. He was terrified of being run through. Qin Ming didn't intend to kill him; he had only, by feel, pierced his skin just enough to draw blood. He poked Wang Youping out, then kicked him three meters away, sending him sprawling into a snowdrift again. "Qin... Ming." "Brother Ming, we're from the same village; we'll see each other around. Please be lenient, we were wrong this time." Once the three recognized him and saw the gleaming steel spear in his hand pointed at them, they immediately cowered. In truth, they all carried knives and clubs, but seeing such a formidable and murderous Qin Ming, they were terrified to their core. Moreover, being injured, they were too cowardly to resist. They typically bullied the weak and feared the strong; when truly faced with a tough opponent, they wouldn't dare cause trouble. Although their actions were despicable, Qin Ming wasn't going to kill them for it. However, a fierce "education" was unavoidable. He pressed the steel spear against their bodies, making them squat obediently on the ground. Then, he gave them a thorough beating, getting a good workout himself. In the end, all three were bruised and swollen, with blood foaming from their mouths. They wailed miserably for a long time before being let go after a stern warning. Qin Ming felt that such individuals were fierce in appearance but timid at heart; they lacked the courage, let alone the ability, to be truly vicious. A good thrashing would be enough to teach them a lesson.

Meanwhile, outside the dense forest where Qin Ming had confronted the mutated creature, a donkey leisurely approached from the distant open ground. It seemed familiar with the path, as if heading into the mountains. Surprisingly, perched on the donkey's back was a weasel. It was pure white as snow, without a single stray hair. In an era where the sun had set and never risen again, white creatures were quite rare. It wasn't as restless as a typical small animal; on the contrary, it was incredibly calm, even "sage-like," sitting cross-legged on the donkey's back, riding backward, facing the path they had come from. This did not resemble a wild animal; its demeanor was more akin to a composed human, with deep-set eyes, steadily riding the donkey along the path. The mutated creature, which Qin Ming had forced back, lunged forward violently upon seeing the donkey approach. However, when it spotted the snow-white weasel on the donkey's back, it suddenly halted, then turned and plunged into the dense forest, diving headfirst under the thick snow, its body trembling slightly. The donkey showed no alarm, merely glancing indifferently at the creature. Like an old horse knowing its way, it carried the silent weasel deeper into the mountains.

The fire spring was in sight, and the black and white twin trees swayed. Qin Ming quickened his pace, reaching the village entrance moments later, where he finally relaxed completely. "Qin Ming's back!" Someone splitting firewood looked up and saw him. Soon, several courtyard gates facing the street opened. It had long been known that Qin Ming had ventured out alone, and many speculated whether he would return alive or if he would have any harvest. "He went out fully armed just as dusk began..." Twin Tree Village wasn't large, and villagers who heard the commotion along the way came out. Each household had Sunstones, radiating a fiery glow, casting a faint light onto the street. When people saw a red squirrel hanging from the hunting spear Qin Ming carried, they fell silent. This was completely different from what they had imagined. Lu Ze quickly walked over, relieved to see Qin Ming safe and sound, his anxious heart settling. Being a straightforward person, he broke the silence, saying, "Everyone said you went into the mountains to hunt a bear, but it turns out you... caught a squirrel?" "I also raided its home," Qin Ming chuckled. People noticed the beast-skin bag on his back, instantly understanding what it contained, and their eyes gleamed with envy. Then, everyone realized that the squirrel's fiery red fur was faintly glowing, clearly indicating it was a mutated creature, its value undoubtedly not low.

"Not only were you safe on this trip, but your harvest is also considerable," Old Man Liu, who lived at the village entrance, remarked with emotion. Some villagers took the opportunity to ask if it was safe outside. Qin Ming truthfully recounted his experiences along the way; he dared not mislead his neighbors, as that could cost lives. Upon hearing that dangerous mutated creatures were active in the outer forest, everyone's expressions changed. For now, it was still unsafe to venture out alone. Afterward, Qin Ming didn't hide anything, mentioning the actions of Ma Yang, Hu Yong, and Wang Youping, immediately inciting the indignation of the villagers, old and young. "How shameless! They don't dare enter the mountains themselves, yet they want to ambush a fellow villager. This isn't just poaching; they want to take a life, don't they?" Ma Yang, Hu Yong, and Wang Youping, leaning on each other and limping, had just emerged at the village entrance when Lu Ze, with others, gave them another severe beating. "Brother Lu, Uncle Yang, Grandpa Liu, stop! Help!" The three cried out in heartbreaking agony, snot bubbles mixed with blood frozen on their faces. Their plight was primarily due to having incurred public wrath; many people had long disliked them.

Qin Ming gave each child on the street a large handful of nuts, immediately causing the group of children to cheer incessantly. He then spotted Granny Zhou, who looked pale and leaned against her courtyard gate. He quickly walked over, and without allowing her to say much, left her some dried provisions.

"Uncle, you're amazing! The wild walnuts are delicious, and the pine nuts smell so good!" In Qin Ming's home, Wen Rui praised him without reservation, overjoyed, tasting every type of dried fruit, his little mouth unable to stop. "Date paste, yummy, sweet," gurgled little Wen Hui, just over two years old, while eating the steamed, pitted, and mashed red date paste, then planting a loud kiss on Qin Ming's face. Nearby, the red squirrel hanging on the hunting spear awoke from its unconscious state, opening its eyes to see several people rummaging through its "family fortune," and instantly fell into despair. "As expected of a mutated creature, so diligent and capable! It stored over thirty *jin* (approx. 15 kg) of food," Liang Wanqing marveled. The red squirrel's eyes were wide and round, almost spitting fire. At this moment, Lu Ze spoke seriously, "Little Qin, I see your body has pretty much recovered. It's time to seriously consider the matter of 'New Life'."
