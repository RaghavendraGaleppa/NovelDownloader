# Chapter 34: The Monster Core Pill Completed, the Monster Stench Sea

“Since we’ve agreed, then this Demon Companion Grass…” Yang Ji smiled at Jin Suanpan.

“Fellow Daoist, here!” Jin Suanpan pouted but still handed over three stalks of Demon Companion Grass, along with a Monster Lure Pill formula. “Since it’s a three-seven split, I won’t be buying the spiritual herbs for refining the Monster Lure Pills. You’ll have to refine them and give them to me.”

“Alright!” Yang Ji readily agreed, accepting the Demon Companion Grass and the pill formula.

The Demon Companion Grass’s shape wasn’t much different from other aquatic plants, but its color wasn’t green; it was a transparent aquamarine blue. The older the plant, the deeper the blue, and the stronger the blue glow emanating from its surface.

This Demon Companion Grass emitted a peculiar fishy smell. Initially, it was faint, but the longer one smelled it, the more intense it became, as if one were in a rotten fish market, making one very uncomfortable.

“The scent of this Demon Companion Grass is quite unique!” Yang Ji glanced at it, confirming it was indeed [Demon Companion Grass], and couldn’t help but frown.

“Heh, if you dislike it, then give it back. This is something monster beasts love, so naturally, it’s different from what humans prefer. Monster beasts just adore this smell; they feel like they’re ascending to immortality smelling it all day,” Jin Suanpan chuckled.

Yang Ji nodded at his words and put away the spiritual herb.

“The Monster Stench Sea is quite far from the Thousand Islands Sea Region. It’s troublesome for me to go back and forth alone. Let’s go together tomorrow. For today, let’s first buy some necessary items and prepare,” Jin Suanpan said.

“Good.” Yang Ji nodded. He also needed to buy some spiritual herbs for refining the Monster Core Pills and Monster Lure Pills.

After agreeing on the departure time, they left the tavern and each went to various shops to purchase what they needed.

While the Demon Companion Grass for refining Monster Core Pills was precious and hard to come by, other auxiliary herbs, including monster cores, were easily obtainable.

Similarly, the auxiliary herbs for refining Monster Lure Pills were also easy to acquire.

Yang Ji had a good number of spirit stones on him and bought fifty portions of each in one go.

After everything was purchased, he rented a quiet cultivation chamber in the city, preparing to refine the Monster Core Pills.

As night fell, his pill furnace was warmed.

Yang Ji tossed an eighth-grade monster core into the furnace. The Earth Spirit Flame transformed into a fiery tongue, instantly enveloping it.

Before long, the monster core began to melt, transforming into a viscous liquid that slowly spread out.

It was then that a semi-transparent, ferocious monster appeared within the monster core. It resembled a carp, with tough brown scales all over its body. Its dorsal fin was covered in sharp, slanted long spines, as sharp as spears. Its fish eyes grotesquely bulged out, filled with a malevolent aura.

This was a Fiendish Carp Monster, an eighth-grade monster beast.

This semi-transparent Fiendish Carp Monster was precisely the monster soul remnant within the monster core. If this monster soul wasn’t purified, then upon consumption, cultivators with lower cultivation would be corroded by the monster qi, leading to madness in minor cases, and death in severe ones.

And to purify this monster soul, Demon Companion Grass was needed.

Yang Ji didn't hesitate. The moment the monster soul appeared, he quickly pulled out a century-old stalk of Demon Companion Grass.

The Earth Spirit Flame split into two, one melting the monster core, the other melting the Demon Companion Grass. Its medicinal liquid dripped down, fusing with the molten monster core, neutralizing the monster qi.

Yang Ji followed the steps of the pill formula, combining them with his own pill refining experience, operating slowly and methodically.

After the monster core and Demon Companion Grass were completely melted and fused into one, he extended his spiritual sense to perceive it. He didn’t detect a single trace of monster qi; it had clearly been entirely neutralized by the Demon Companion Grass.

At this point, a hint of a smile finally appeared on Yang Ji's face.

The Monster Core Pill was more than half complete, indeed, the most crucial half.

Then, he successively took out several auxiliary herbs and melted them. His operations were fluid and smooth, and he quickly finished melting all the spiritual herbs.

After the steps of pill fusion, pill separation, pill rotation, and nourishment were completed, two hours had already passed.

Yang Ji then patted the pill furnace, and a rich pill fragrance surged out. He flicked his sleeve, quickly dispersing it, then eagerly reached into the furnace and grabbed ten aquamarine-colored pills.

After carefully sensing the immense spiritual energy contained within the pills, Yang Ji’s expression brightened with joy.

He immediately sat down cross-legged and consumed one. The medicinal power surged open, and he quickly channeled his cultivation technique to refine it with all his might.

After refining the first wisp of pure spiritual energy that circulated through his spiritual roots, he knew that the Monster Core Pill, refined from an eighth-grade monster core and a century-old Demon Companion Grass, could provide him with approximately 20 cultivation points per day.

This meant that for the remaining four years, as long as he continuously consumed pills of this quality, he would absolutely be able to reach the tenth layer of Qi Condensation, or even make further progress, by the time the three major sects recruited outer disciples.

Yang Ji finally let out a long breath, and a fervent flame ignited in his heart.

If an eighth-grade monster core paired with century-old Demon Companion Grass yielded such an effect, then how much faster would the cultivation speed be for Monster Core Pills refined from tenth-grade monster cores, Monster General-grade monster cores, or even Monster Commander-grade monster cores, paired with even older Demon Companion Grass?

He felt a hidden excitement, as if he saw a smooth path ahead after reaching Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages.

Yang Ji was truly radiant at this moment, full of spirit.

He then stood up, letting the spiritual power vortex refine the pills on its own, while he prepared to refine the Monster Lure Pills.

The time for pill refining passed quickly.

By dawn, Yang Ji had already finished refining. As the first ray of sunlight illuminated Canglan City, he had already left his room.

Canglan Island, port.

Yang Ji hadn’t been there long when Jin Suanpan flew over.

“Fellow Daoist looks quite spirited today,” Jin Suanpan said with a smile as he approached.

“The pills are refined, so naturally my mood is pleasant,” Yang Ji smiled faintly and handed over the Monster Lure Pills. “Can these Monster Lure Pills, refined from sixty-year-old Demon Companion Grass, be exchanged for century-old Demon Companion Grass?”

Jin Suanpan took the pills, inspected them briefly, and was astonished: “More than just ‘can’! It’s absolutely a huge ‘yes’! Fellow Daoist, the pills you’ve refined are almost entirely free of impurities. These are top-grade among their kind. Your pill refining technique, has it already reached the level of a quasi-Pill Master? Haha, we’ve struck it rich, struck it rich!”

Jin Suanpan laughed heartily, his gaze fixated on Yang Ji with fervor. He patted his chest and said, “Monster Lure Pills are extremely useful in the Monster Stench Sea. Pills of this quality can even attract tenth-grade monster beasts. They can definitely be exchanged for high-grade Demon Companion Grass.”

“If so, that would be for the best.” Yang Ji was also somewhat pleased by his words; this concerned his major cultivation plan.

“How many stalks of century-old Demon Companion Grass can generally be exchanged for ten pills?” he asked again.

“Generally, five Monster Lure Pills refined from sixty-year-old Demon Companion Grass can be exchanged for one stalk. If the Demon Companion Grass is a century old, then roughly two Monster Lure Pills refined from it can be exchanged for one stalk,” Jin Suanpan explained.

Yang Ji nodded, saying, “In that case, I’ll use a stalk of century-old Demon Companion Grass to refine Monster Lure Pills, increasing our exchange capital. If we can exchange the yield of one [century-old] stalk for five [sixty-year-old] stalks, it will be easier from then on.”

“That’s absolutely the best plan,” Jin Suanpan chuckled.

“Let’s go. We’ll take a ship to the Monster Stench Sea. It might take a month,” Jin Suanpan said.

“A month’s journey? The Teleportation Hall is right there,” Yang Ji pointed in confusion.

“Teleportation? The Monster Stench Sea is different from the Thousand Islands Sea Region. Monster tides frequently erupt there. If it’s a terrifying grand monster tide launched by a Monster Emperor, even the Thousand Islands Sea Region would suffer, as the affected area is very wide.”

“Therefore, no cities are even built in that area, let alone teleportation arrays. Perhaps if one were built today, a monster tide could erupt tomorrow and smash it to pieces. The cost of repeated repairs would be too high.”

“Don’t think that all monster beasts only swim in the water. Some amphibious monster beasts are invincible in the sea and also overlords on land, capable of destroying cities and pushing islands, incredibly powerful.”

“When you go to the Monster Stench Sea, the sky is your blanket and the earth your bed. Finding a suitable cave on an islet and burrowing in is your home.”

Jin Suanpan chuckled.

“I see!” Yang Ji nodded in understanding.

After a moment’s wait, the two boarded a ship bound for the Monster Stench Sea. The month-long journey quickly passed in cultivation.

One day, Yang Ji suddenly smelled a peculiar fishy scent, different from that of the Thousand Islands Sea Region, with his every breath.

He slowly rose, stood on the deck, and gazed forward. Ahead lay an unfamiliar sea region; the seawater was no longer deep blue, but green—a vast expanse of green as far as the eye could see.

“This is the Monster Stench Sea?” Yang Ji’s eyes calmly swept across the sea ahead.

“Welcome to the Monster Stench Sea,” Jin Suanpan said to Yang Ji with a smile.
