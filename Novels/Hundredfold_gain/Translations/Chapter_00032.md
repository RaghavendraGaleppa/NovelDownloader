# Chapter 32: Gathering Yuan Pill and Advancement Speed  

Half a month later, in the inner sect of Fengyue Sect.  

Among the mountains surrounding Fengyue Lake, in a first-grade upper-tier cave dwelling perched on a cliff within one of the inner sect's spiritual peaks, Qi Chuan sat cross-legged on a stone bed, assuming a cultivation posture. Wisps of spiritual energy separated from the void, flowing like mist into his body through his mouth, nose, and pores.  

The speed at which the spiritual energy surged was incomparable to when Qi Chuan had cultivated in his private peak at Red Maple Valley. This was undoubtedly the effect of the first-grade upper-tier cave dwelling. However, within the entire cave dwelling—and even the entire spiritual peak—only this stone chamber had a spiritual energy concentration that reached the first-grade upper-tier level. Most other areas only had first-grade lower-tier spiritual energy. Even so, it still lived up to its reputation as a first-grade upper-tier cave dwelling.  

*Huff…*  

After a while, Qi Chuan opened his eyes and exhaled a white sword of qi.  

**[You have activated the Evergreen Art, absorbing spiritual energy and refining medicinal power, converting it into your own mana. Triggering an eightfold critical hit, you gained an eightfold harvest. Your total mana has slightly increased.]**  

As Qi Chuan opened his eyes, a familiar line of text appeared before him. Seeing it, he smiled faintly, then closed his eyes and used his spiritual sense to examine the total amount of mana in his dantian.  

*Hmm, not bad. After this hour of cultivation, my mana has increased even more than before. It seems the Gathering Yuan Pill is indeed far superior to the family’s Spirit Tempering Pill.*  

Nodding slightly, Qi Chuan opened his eyes.  

Since moving into this first-grade upper-tier cave dwelling half a month ago, he had spent a few days familiarizing himself with the inner sect’s surroundings. Afterward, he visited the inner sect’s Alchemy Pavilion and exchanged for five "Gathering Yuan Pills," suitable for mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators. He then used these pills to aid his cultivation in the cave dwelling.  

Compared to the Qi Family’s Spirit Tempering Pill, the Gathering Yuan Pill was much more expensive—costing ten low-grade spirit stones per pill. Purchasing five had left Qi Chuan with only about twenty low-grade spirit stones to his name. The Qi Family’s Spirit Tempering Pill, on the other hand, cost only five low-grade spirit stones—nearly half the price.  

However, the Gathering Yuan Pill had its advantages. It increased cultivation speed by about a third compared to the Spirit Tempering Pill.  

This was a staggering improvement. If Fengyue Sect ever decided to make these pills available to the public, countless cultivation families would likely be willing to pay even more spirit stones to obtain them.  

Unfortunately, the Gathering Yuan Pill was only available for exchange within the inner sect, and there were strict quotas, preventing any possibility of resale.  

Of course, if an inner sect disciple were willing to slow their own cultivation and save some pills to sell outside, it wouldn’t be impossible—but very few would do so.  

*At this rate of mana accumulation, I should be able to reach the fifth level of Qi Refinement in about a year and a half.*  

Qi Chuan calculated his progress.  

After reaching the mid-stage of Qi Refinement—from the fourth to the sixth level—there were no bottlenecks. As long as one’s mana reached the required threshold, they could advance.  

With the abundant spiritual energy in the first-grade upper-tier cave dwelling and the aid of the Gathering Yuan Pill, Qi Chuan’s cultivation speed, which should have slowed down after entering the mid-stage, was instead faster than expected.  

Even if counting from the time he first reached the fourth level of Qi Refinement, including the previous few months, it would take less than two years to reach the fifth level.  

*Less than two years to go from the early fourth level to the fifth level?*  

Such a speed would astonish many if word got out.  

*At this rate, reaching the late stage of Qi Refinement before the age of thirty won’t be a problem. Even if I fail to become a core disciple, I can still remain in the inner sect until I’m fifty.*  

*Of course, that’s the worst-case scenario. Maybe I’ll pass the core disciple selection before thirty and become a core disciple?*  

Qi Chuan mused to himself.  

Whether the best or worst outcome, his situation was far better than that of an average inner sect disciple.  

The inner sect of Fengyue Sect had many disciples—not just those from cultivation families like Qi Chuan, but also many senior disciples.  

A few days ago, while taking a break, Qi Chuan had heard that the sect’s recruitment had officially ended.  

Aside from recruiting some servant and outer disciples, the sect had also admitted a few inner disciples—talented rogue cultivators deemed worthy by Fengyue Sect.  

One of them, named Li Qingshan, was said to possess a top-three-grade spiritual root. However, he had started cultivating late and was already eighteen years old with only the fourth level of Qi Refinement.  

Still, with such a spiritual root, he had potential. With the inner sect’s resources, he had a chance to reach the late stage of Qi Refinement before thirty and possibly even become a core disciple in the future.  

In Fengyue Sect’s history, there had been rogue cultivators who, by sheer luck, joined the sect and eventually rose to become core disciples.  

*But in the end, whether it’s new disciples, old disciples, family disciples, or rogue cultivators—no matter how complex or simple the inner sect’s dynamics—it doesn’t concern me much.*  

*I just need to focus on my cultivation. When my strength is sufficient and a core disciple position opens up, I’ll try for it.*  

*If I fail once, I’ll try again. Sooner or later, I’ll succeed. Becoming a core disciple isn’t an issue.*  

Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Qi Chuan steadied his mind and resumed cultivating the Evergreen Art.  

**[You have activated the Evergreen Art, absorbing spiritual energy and refining medicinal power, converting it into your own mana. Triggering a sevenfold critical hit, you gained a sevenfold harvest. Your total mana has slightly increased.]**  

…  

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.  

On this day, Qi Chuan stepped out of his first-grade upper-tier cave dwelling.  

After exiting, he took out his cave token, infused it with a strand of mana, and flicked it lightly. A beam of light shot into the cave, activating the protective formation around it.  

Glowing runes rose from the cave’s surroundings, enveloping the entire dwelling and half the cliff in a barrier that even blocked spiritual sense.  

This ensured that no one but Qi Chuan could enter.  

Of course, given Qi Chuan’s current poverty, the cave was just as empty as when he first arrived.  

*It’s time to head out.*  

Watching the formation activate, Qi Chuan murmured to himself.  

Since entering the inner sect, he had devoted himself to cultivation for several months, significantly increasing his mana and making steady progress in the fourth level of Qi Refinement.  

Additionally, through occasional practice, he had mastered all five basic elemental spells—Golden Skin Technique, Earth Wall Technique, and Wood Vine Technique—bringing them to the Great Achievement stage, unlike before when only the Fireball and Water Arrow Techniques had reached that level.  

However, the inner sect required disciples to complete three missions a year. Thus, he had no choice but to leave and fulfill this obligation.  

With that, Qi Chuan turned and left his cave, heading toward the Mission Hall in the inner sect.  

The Mission Hall wasn’t far—just a few peaks away. With Qi Chuan’s current speed, he arrived quickly.  

At the summit of the peak stood a tall building—the Mission Hall. Around it, streaks of light descended from the sky, revealing figures who then entered the hall. These were inner sect disciples with flying artifacts, though they were few in number.  

Most, like Qi Chuan, walked there on foot.  

While Qi Refinement cultivators could use the Levitation Technique to fly briefly, it consumed too much mana. Under normal circumstances, they preferred to conserve their energy.  

The inner sect had many disciples, though they were scattered. The Mission Hall, however, was a lively place.  

Unlike Qi Chuan, who benefited from his hundredfold critical hits and only needed standard pills to cultivate, most disciples had to work hard for resources.  

They not only completed the mandatory three missions per year but often took on extra tasks to earn more resources, pushing themselves to the limit for faster breakthroughs and stronger techniques.  

Even disciples from cultivation families were no exception—unless, of course, they were like Ye Liang, who came from a powerful family and possessed a top-tier spiritual root. His family likely poured resources into him.  

But with his golden finger, Qi Chuan only needed to complete the three annual missions to sustain his cultivation.
