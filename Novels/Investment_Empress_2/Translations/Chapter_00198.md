# Chapter 198: The Concern of the Empress from the Phoenix Heaven

The Martial Arts Summit had concluded, and a new generation of Sword Elites had emerged.

Today, Cloud Province City was even more bustling than ever before.

For a time, it sparked widespread discussion among all sectors of the Jianghu. Even Elder Zeng of the Five Elements Swordsman commented that this summit had left an indelible mark on the Hengyun Sword City, and indeed, on the entire Martial Arts Summit.

But no matter how lively the outside world was, in a certain small courtyard, time still passed peacefully and quietly.

Chef Li could now split his focus, holding a wok in each hand.

The Sword Pill in his Dantian spun rapidly, controlling the sharp killing intent with microscopic precision, each wielding a spatula to stir-fry vigorously.

"Refining pills and stir-frying dishes share the same principle."

"Does that mean I might be a hidden genius in the Dao of Alchemy?"

Li Mo decided to return to the mountain and try his hand with Old Xue. Old Xue would surely welcome him.

Jiang Chulong, wearing an apron, busied herself assisting him on the side, occasionally sneaking cautious glances at Brother Li's profile.

"Chulong, why didn't you go to the Treasure寰 Tower?"

The Treasure寰 Tower was the most luxurious restaurant in Cloud Province; the entire building was likely worth one percent of Li Mo's net worth. Naturally, after the summit, there would be a grand banquet, a gathering of heroes.

Of course, it was also an opportunity for the upper echelons of Cloud Province to witness the brilliance of the summit's top ten. Mainly, to appreciate the Sword Elite.

The Sword Elite represented the pinnacle of sword art among Cloud Province's younger generation.

"Ah?"

Jiang Chulong opened her small mouth, stunned.

Elder Zeng had actually advised her to go, saying that the Treasure寰 Tower was lively and fun.

Princess Jiang had initially thought she might find some "garbage" to scavenge. But upon hearing that Brother Li wasn't going, she immediately found the idea unappealing.

Was it that she wasn't yet accustomed to such lively places?

Li Mo chuckled, stuffing a piece of chicken into her open mouth.

"Maybe it's because my cooking tastes better than the Treasure寰 Tower's."

"Mm-hmm!"

...

The clouds in the distance were stained with a magnificent rose color. The final sun slowly set, exhaling its last breath, bringing a cool breeze to the sweltering summer night.

The evening wind blew gently.

Hearing footsteps behind her, the distracted Ying Bing turned around.

A simple, yet thousand-gold-worth meal of four dishes and one soup was set on the table.

It was homely food.

The two people chatting were him, still so gentle yet interesting in his tone.

Jiang Chulong listened with her chin in her hands, swinging her legs, listening with utter seriousness.

She showed none of the self-awareness of a youth who had shocked the world at the Hengyun Sword City, a future hidden dragon.

It seemed that if you randomly pushed open the door of a peaceful, hardworking family, you could see such a scene.

The deep contemplation on her brows dissipated unconsciously.

There was a truth she had actually known for a long time.

If she had never experienced the烟火 (yānhuǒ - the smoke and fire of the mortal world, meaning everyday life), her life would be incomplete. How could she speak of becoming an immortal?

She should maintain a calm heart towards all things.

Seeing a crease on Li Mo's collar, she reached out and gently smoothed it.

"???"

Li Mo was taken aback.

Ice Cube was fixing his collar?

Something was off...

The Empress had always been aloof and peerless, unattainable. Looking into her eyes for too long made one feel as if she were looking at an ant...

Was it because Ice Cube couldn't tolerate any dirt? Yes, that must be it!

Feeling a strange sensation, Li Mo continued to say to Princess Jiang:

"We can put a swing in the yard."

"A swing?"

"Yeah, when you push it, you can fly really high."

"Wow... that sounds fun... Brother Li... so amazing..."

"Can I ride it too?"

As they were speaking, a voice as clear as jade sounded from the side.

Princess Jiang tilted her head in confusion.

Little Li Student leaned back slightly.

He turned his head and met those cold eyes, seeing a hint of curiosity.

"Ice Cube?"

---

Li Mo tentatively called out to her.

Could the Hengyun Sword Slash have some side effect?

He really couldn't imagine Ice Cube sitting on a swing, smiling like a flower.

It was abnormal. Too abnormal.

So abnormal that Li Mo felt a bit uneasy.

The food夹 on his chopsticks fell into the soup, splashing a few drops of oil onto his clothes.

The more he thought about it, the more something felt wrong...

"It's possible."

"Mm, your clothes are dirty."

Ying Bing saw the stain.

Li Mo took off his outer robe and set it aside.

"Uh... I'll go get some water..."

"I'll wash it for you."

Before the clothes could touch the stool, they were taken by a slender hand.

She stood up gently and walked towards the well.

Watching her roll up her sleeves and scrub the clothes there, Li Mo's mouth hung open for a long time.

Washing clothes?

Ice Cube not only fixed his collar, wanted to sit on a swing, but also actively washed his clothes for him?

Suddenly, he felt a bit of a cold sweat.

Little Li Student thought it over but couldn't figure it out.

He lowered his voice:

"Chulong, is your Sister Bing okay?"

"Um... I don't... I don't know medicine... but she shouldn't be... sick..."

"Then what is the reason?"

"Because..."

Jiang Chulong bit her lip, the question marks on her little head multiplying. She probably couldn't figure it out, and her CPU might even crash.

Suddenly, a 'tearing' sound caught her attention. Princess Jiang looked over instinctively and almost cried.

The clothes... the clothes were ruined?

Li Mo: "..."

As expected, Ice Cube wasn't suited for this kind of thing; she was a先天家務黑洞聖體 (innate holy body of a household chores black hole).

"The clothes... the clothes..."

"Chulong, that's not the one you made for me."

"Oh oh..."

Princess Jiang felt a bit less heartbroken. Since the clothes were torn, Brother Li wouldn't wear torn clothes, so she could take them.

Snapping back to reality, Jiang Chulong asked timidly and confusedly:

"Sister Bing... Sister Bing's Yi Soul seems to be growing... growing faster than usual?"

"Huh?"

Li Mo was momentarily stunned.

He saw not far away, the girl washing clothes in the moonlight. If you ignored the fact that she was ruining the clothes, it was still quite peaceful and beautiful.

So beautiful and dreamlike that Li Mo felt he might not be awake.

In an instant, he racked his brain.

Ice Cube was not only abnormally concerned about others, but also enhancing her Yi Soul by observing the Taiyin (Moon) while doing household chores?

Why is that?!

Little Li Student suddenly felt that sword techniques seemed quite simple.

At least simpler than the mind of the Empress from the Phoenix Heaven, Ice Cube.

Not long after, Ying Bing walked over holding the clothes. She shook them vigorously twice, imitating the motions she had seen, and hung them on the clothesline.

"It's washed."

"Mm..."

Looking at the clothes that were now beyond recognition and could hardly be called clothes anymore, Li Mo took a deep breath:

"Thank you."

"No need, it's what I should do."

Ying Bing walked towards her room, then turned back at the end:

"Tonight... remember to come find me."

"Huh?"

"Dual cultivation."

"Huh?!!"
