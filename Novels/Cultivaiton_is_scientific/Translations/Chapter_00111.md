**Chapter 111: Negotiation**  

"Lan'er, your mother wouldn’t harm you. Let me meet him—my judgment can help vet him so you won’t be deceived!" The black-robed woman held Yin Shilan's hand, coaxing her gently.  

"Exactly! Just one meeting won’t hurt him!" Ren Fei'er chimed in eagerly, her eyes gleaming.  

In an instant, mother and daughter had formed an alliance, their eyes shining with anticipation.  

"Mother!" Yin Shilan sighed helplessly. She knew her mother’s temperament all too well—if she didn’t give in today, she’d be pestered endlessly.  

"He’s just a friend I get along with. Even if you wanted to meet him now, you couldn’t—he’s been assigned a mandatory mission," she explained.  

Her explanation only deepened her mother’s conviction that her daughter had fallen for someone.  

"What’s his name? How old is he? What’s his cultivation level? What’s he skilled in?" the black-robed woman pressed rapidly.  

Yin Shilan was flustered by the barrage of questions, further unsettled by Ren Fei'er tugging at her arm and staring at her with pleading eyes.  

She might be able to refuse outsiders, but she couldn’t deny her family.  

Of course, the main reason was that, in her own view, her relationship with Li Shiming was still at the stage of close friendship.  

"His name is Li Shiming. He’s a new disciple from this year’s intake, and he has extraordinary talent in formations," Yin Shilan answered after some hesitation.  

"No wonder you two get along so well!" Ren Fei'er said knowingly, though her youthful demeanor made it comical, prompting Yin Shilan to ruffle her hair.  

"Wait—new disciples don’t get assigned mandatory missions," the black-robed woman countered, shaking her head.  

Though not an elder of Tianhai Sect, she was just as knowledgeable about its affairs. She quickly spotted the inconsistency in Yin Shilan’s words.  

"He told me himself—it shouldn’t be wrong!" Yin Shilan replied, startled.  

"I’m not saying Li Shiming lied to you," the black-robed woman clarified with a smile, though her eyes darkened slightly.  

Yin Shilan had been sheltered too well by her and Elder Yin, leaving her ignorant of the darker undercurrents within the sect.  

While Tianhai Sect had strict rules against internal conflicts, some cultivators still found ways to target weaker peers.  

"Lan'er, did Li Shiming mention owning anything valuable?" the black-robed woman asked after a moment.  

"He’s a new disciple—what could he possibly have? Though I did see a Spirit Talisman Bamboo in his cave," Yin Shilan replied after some thought.  

To her, the Spirit Talisman Bamboo was practically worthless. She wouldn’t have even remembered it if her mother hadn’t asked.  

"Check if that cave still belongs to Li Shiming," the black-robed woman instructed, already suspecting the truth.  

Yin Shilan’s expression shifted as she retrieved her identity jade slip to check.  

"Eagle Beak Island has a new owner—a cultivator named Han Tianlei," she said softly, a rare flicker of anger in her eyes.  

To others, Eagle Beak Island might be insignificant, but to her, it was where she and Li Shiming had first met—a place she wouldn’t allow others to violate.  

"It seems Li Shiming is in danger," the black-robed woman murmured, frowning.  

The worst-case scenario had unfolded. She worried how Yin Shilan would take the news but knew she had to speak up.  

"Li Shiming should be fine. Even if he can’t defeat his enemies, escaping won’t be a problem," Yin Shilan said confidently.  

"You didn’t give him any of your life-saving treasures, did you?" the black-robed woman asked sharply, alarmed.  

Both Yin Shilan and Ren Fei'er carried precious protective artifacts gifted by her and Elder Yin—each one rare and difficult to obtain.  

"He doesn’t need them. He has his own Spirit Tortoise Shield, a hand-held defensive formation he designed. Even late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators can’t break through it," Yin Shilan said proudly, as if forgetting she had contributed to its design and provided the materials.  

"Even so, I’ll send someone to check on him," the black-robed woman said, shaking her head at Yin Shilan’s expression.  

Though Yin Shilan hadn’t given Li Shiming any life-saving treasures, her demeanor suggested she’d entrusted him with something even more precious.  

As a mother, the black-robed woman felt both joy and reluctance, tinged with faint worry.  

"Mother, I’ll go protect Li Shiming!" Ren Fei'er exclaimed excitedly, raising her hand.  

"Stay put and don’t cause trouble!" the black-robed woman scolded, pressing Ren Fei'er’s hand down with a glare.  

"You always underestimate me! I’m at late-stage Qi Refinement too!" Ren Fei'er muttered under her breath, though her eyes darted around mischievously.  

"Old Monster Baili is here. Stay here," the black-robed woman said, glancing at the distant sky before waving the sisters back.  

The island was protected by a third-grade formation, shielding them from Golden Core-level disturbances—the reason the black-robed woman dared bring them here.  

Besides, they were near Tianhai Sect. If a fight broke out, the sect wouldn’t ignore it.  

The black-robed woman soared into the sky, her robes fluttering as an eerie wind rose around her.  

In an instant, the gentle mother transformed into a fearsome Golden Core demonic cultivator.  

"Fellow Daoist Ren, why are you here?" Elder Baili asked, his expression souring as he approached.  

"Old Monster Baili, you’re bullying my daughter now? If I hadn’t come, would you have kidnapped Lan'er?" the black-robed woman retorted coldly, showing no respect for the Golden Core elder.  

"Fellow Daoist Ren, my son’s disappearance is related to your daughter. Can’t I even ask questions?" Elder Baili snapped, frustration evident in his voice.  

He knew Yin Shilan’s background and had only intended to question her, nothing more.  

"My daughter has already said she didn’t know your son was coming, nor has she seen him," the black-robed woman replied dismissively.  

"Let me speak to her directly so I can confirm," Elder Baili pleaded, desperation creeping into his tone. The longer this dragged on, the slimmer the chances of Baili Jinran’s survival.  

But the black-robed woman would never allow her daughter to face Elder Baili directly. A Golden Core cultivator could plant insidious spiritual marks, potentially hindering Yin Shilan’s future cultivation.  

Golden Core cultivators had countless methods—even fellow Golden Cores couldn’t guarantee complete protection.  

"Old Monster Baili, do you think I’m easy to bully? If you want war, Tianhai Sect and Profound Nether Sect will oblige. Go prepare—see if I can’t poison every last one of you in Holy Ice Sect!" the black-robed woman sneered, turning to leave.  

Her ferocity left Elder Baili’s face darkening.  

Was this how negotiations worked?  

All he wanted was to ask a simple question. Was it worth escalating to this extent?  

Of course, any cultivator below Foundation Establishment would be stunned by the black-robed woman’s words.  

Given Yin Shilan’s status, Tianhai Sect’s involvement was expected—but why was Profound Nether Sect involved, and even hinting at an alliance with Tianhai Sect?  

The black-robed woman radiated demonic energy—her other identity was a Golden Core elder of Profound Nether Sect.  

"Old Demon Ren, I’m just worried about Jinran. Since you’ve said your daughter hasn’t seen him, I’ll take your word for it," Elder Baili conceded through gritted teeth.  

Holy Ice Sect’s strength was roughly on par with Tianhai Sect or Profound Nether Sect.  

A full-scale war between the three was unlikely—none would willingly provoke a Golden Core-level conflict.  

But the black-robed woman, whom he called Old Demon Ren, was an exception. Her past exploits were legendary in the cultivation world.  

She had once single-handedly nearly wiped out a mid-sized sect using poison—endless, insidious toxins even Foundation Establishment cultivators couldn’t evade.  

More terrifyingly, her poisoning methods were undetectable. A cultivator might drink a cup of water and collapse without warning.  

In her youth, the black-robed woman had been unruly. Had she not fallen in love with Tianhai Sect’s Elder Yin, countless more cultivators might have suffered.  

"I have children too—I understand your concern. I’ll have Profound Nether Sect disciples help search for your son," the black-robed woman said, her smile returning.  

She knew when to relent. Threats were satisfying, but she had no intention of starting a real war.  

Still, after years of self-restraint, she needed to remind others that she remained Old Demon Ren—a Golden Core demonic cultivator unafraid to act.  

"I thank you on Jinran’s behalf," Elder Baili said with a nod before vanishing.  

The black-robed woman’s aura receded, her demonic presence fading as she returned to her gentle demeanor and descended to the island.  

Yin Shilan and Ren Fei'er, accustomed to their mother’s temperament, welcomed her triumphant return.  

"Old Monster Baili won’t give up, but he won’t trouble Lan'er again. I suspect Baili Jinran’s fate is sealed," the black-robed woman said lightly.  

Golden Core cultivators rarely had children, let alone one nearly fully trained. Elder Baili would pursue this to the end.  

But the black-robed woman doubted he’d succeed. If he hadn’t found clues by now, the chances were slim.  

Cultivator tracking methods were most effective when used early. The longer the delay, the lower the odds of success.  

Elder Baili had likely exhausted all means before resorting to questioning Yin Shilan.  

Yin Shilan, however, thought of Li Shiming. Though she claimed not to worry, a trace of concern lingered.  

At only Qi Refinement fourth layer, even with the Spirit Tortoise Shield, he’d face dangers.  

"Lan'er, don’t act against Han Tianlei. Wait for Li Shiming to return. Men don’t like overly assertive women," the black-robed woman advised gently, reading her daughter’s thoughts.  

"I know," Yin Shilan murmured, lowering her eyes.  

"Fei'er and I will return. Don’t worry about Li Shiming—I’ll send someone to protect him," the black-robed woman reassured, patting Yin Shilan’s head.  

Two days later, the black-robed woman discovered her younger daughter, Ren Fei'er, was missing. Sensing her location through a tracking artifact, she sighed.  

"Not a single one of them lets me rest easy!"  

Ren Fei'er’s personality resembled hers, though far less reckless—thanks to her mother’s discipline.  

Still, she wasn’t overly worried. Ren Fei'er had headed toward Nanshan Country, where Li Shiming’s mission was—a mortal region with no threats to a Qi Refinement cultivator.  

Ren Fei'er had always been restless. Letting her go might be for the best.  

Besides, a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the sect was already en route to Nanshan Country. The black-robed woman sent word for them to keep an eye on Ren Fei'er.  

---  

In a cave in Nanshan Country, Li Shiming stared at the barely intact Han Yu, murderous intent flashing in his eyes.  

He hadn’t expected Han Tianlei to genuinely plot his death over a cave.  

The perpetrators were Han Tianlei’s family. No wonder the mandatory mission had sent him to Nanshan Country—it was a death trap.  

Had he been an ordinary Qi Refinement fourth-layer cultivator, he’d have died here.  

From Han Yu’s confession, he learned the situation in Nanshan Country and began formulating a plan.  

The mandatory mission had to be completed—even if it was a trap, he’d deal with it afterward.  

Han Yu, the Han family head, proved easier to break than expected. After minimal torture, he spilled everything—relevant or not—to avoid further suffering.  

When it came to interrogation, Li Shiming was centuries ahead of his time.  

IBMz15’s medical data pinpointed the most painful areas of the human body, psychology texts helped him manipulate minds, and interrogation techniques diversified his methods.  

A pampered rogue cultivator like Han Yu, backed by Han Tianlei, lacked the resilience of true wanderers.  

Li Shiming’s spiritual hand twisted Han Yu’s neck, the man’s face relaxing in relief.  

He placed Han Yu’s corpse alongside the other nine Han family cultivators and inspected their storage pouches.  

Unsurprisingly, they held little of value—just some spirit stones. Even Han Yu’s own weapon was only a mid-grade magical tool, far beneath Li Shiming’s current standards.  

The ten storage pouches, however, expanded his IBMz15’s storage capacity, allowing him to carry more.  

Summoning a paper crane, he flew toward Nanshan Country’s capital, replenishing his spiritual energy with spirit stones.  

"Eh?" Before long, he sensed a spiritual energy fluctuation approaching.
