# Chapter 93: I Approve of the Divine Mother's Marriage to Master!  

Divine radiance blazed, pressing down upon the ancestral lands of the Wan Clan.  

The voice of the Divine Mother, though feminine, carried immense authority and weight.  

Everyone looked up to see a divine statue in the sky, its light illuminating the land.  

Across Lin Yuan Prefecture, people knelt and kowtowed in reverence at the sight of the Divine Mother's manifestation, overcome with awe.  

Within the Wan Clan's ancestral grounds, silence reigned. Under the Divine Mother's oppressive aura, the clan patriarch dared not move, and the three elders at the True Qi realm trembled in fear.  

Even Gu Changzhou, the former "Chosen One" who had fled from the Luofu Immortal Sect, wore a grave expression.  

The Vajra Temple's Buddha Child clasped his hands together, chanting a Buddhist mantra, though his eyes revealed deep contemplation.  

Only Li Zhengjing and his companions remained unfazed.  

The Hanging Bird preened its feathers.  

The little dragon girl blinked her eyes, brimming with curiosity.  

*"The list of offerings has already been submitted to the temple and reported to the capital. The imperial court is well aware of it. If offerings are missing now, is that not an insult to this deity?"*  

*"Not to mention you, the Vajra Temple's Buddha Child—even if the head of your Arhat Hall were here, he would not dare disrespect this deity!"*  

The Divine Mother descended upon the Wan Clan's ancestral lands, her voice booming.  

*"In terms of status, you represent the Vajra Temple, while I represent the Great Zhou Dynasty. Why should I fear you? In terms of cultivation, you have yet to attain a Golden Body, while I was already a Human Immortal over a thousand years ago. Now, as one of the Six Divine Mothers of the Southern Domain, why should I give you face?"*  

"..."  

The Vajra Temple's Buddha Child frowned slightly.  

The Hanging Bird chuckled. *"Seems even your reputation as the Buddha Child isn't enough to sway the Divine Mother."*  

Gu Changzhou stepped forward and bowed. *"This junior, Gu Changzhou, is a true disciple of the Luofu Immortal Sect and a direct disciple of the Wan Clan's ancestor. The Wan Clan of Lin Yuan wishes to offer worship to the Divine Mother of the Southern Domain from now on, revering her with utmost sincerity. We beg the Divine Mother's forgiveness!"*  

The Divine Mother glanced at him. *"The Luofu Immortal Sect's leader has fallen, the Wan Clan's ancestor is dead, and the entire sect is in turmoil. Do you think this can intimidate me?"*  

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin but remained silent.  

Yet the Divine Mother's gaze fell upon him.  

*"You're the traitor of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect?"*  

She spoke slowly. *"Now that you're wanted by the sect and in dire straits, instead of seeking refuge, you dare come to my domain to demand offerings? You young upstarts, barely the best of your generation, are nothing more than brats in my eyes!"*  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing rubbed his temples. He hadn't expected to be berated before even speaking.  

This so-called Divine Mother of the Southern Domain seemed unbeatable in verbal combat—was she a former gossipmonger in her past life?  

*"Today, I came to inspect Lin Yuan Prefecture, only to find offerings missing. Do you know the crime of blasphemy?"*  

*"Offerings this, offerings that—do you know what crime it is to eat me?"*  

The Hanging Bird sneered. *"They say the gods watch over all, but you're so blind you can't even recognize my identity. Eat me, and you'll burst your belly and lose your head!"*  

*"Hm? Who are you?"*  

The Divine Mother's eyes flickered with wariness, clearly taken aback by the bird's boldness.  

Given her insight, she could tell the bird wasn't lying.  

*"My true form is the White Luan Divine Bird, descendant of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's guardian divine beast. My grandfather is the White Firmament Venerable, a renowned immortal beast of the world. Do you dare provoke me?"*  

"..."  

Silence fell over the scene.  

The Vajra Temple's Buddha Child glanced at the bird with pity.  

Gu Changzhou remained deep in thought.  

Only Li Zhengjing sighed.  

The Divine Mother's voice turned furious. *"Not only does your bizarre appearance bear no resemblance to the White Luan Divine Bird, but even if your grandfather were truly the White Firmament Venerable, so what? He's now on the brink of death, missing and presumed dead. The Feather Transformation Sect has declared his life sigil dimmed—he might as well be gone!"*  

Her divine might surged forth as she roared, *"Even if the White Firmament Venerable were alive, I'd still eat you today!"*  

*"What?"*  

The Hanging Bird shuddered, its expression blank as it turned to Li Zhengjing for confirmation.  

Li Zhengjing nodded silently.  

The bird staggered as if struck by lightning, its mind reeling.  

And the Divine Mother was already upon them!  

At that moment, Li Zhengjing raised his left hand—the Blazing Sun Divine Sword erupted forth!  

The sword streaked across the sky, flames and sword intent tearing through the clouds!  

*BOOM!*  

The Divine Mother staggered back, her eyes filled with shock.  

But the Wan Clan members were even more horrified.  

The patriarch and the three elders trembled, thanking their lucky stars they hadn't provoked Li Zhengjing earlier.  

Gu Changzhou's pupils contracted. *"Such power! If that strike had landed on me, I'd be dead on the spot... In a fight, I'd have to avoid him at all costs. No wonder Lu Huaiyuan lost to him."*  

The Vajra Temple's Buddha Child was equally stunned. *"Just a month ago, he was only at the Internal Qi realm. How has he grown so much? Even the Kunlun Sect's Young Master, with all his resources, never advanced this fast!"*  

Li Zhengjing stuffed the dazed Hanging Bird into the Parasol Wood Box, then pulled out a broken jade fragment.  

*"The Heavenly Balance King was a peak Human Immortal in life, stronger than you. But after death, his divine form weakened his power."*  

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice echoed in his mind. *"Now, your strength far surpasses what it was at Fengdu Mountain. Together, even if we can't slay a god today, we won't lose!"*  

Li Zhengjing acknowledged, swallowing the jade fragment and gripping the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber. Just as he stepped forward, the Divine Mother spoke again.  

*"A mighty sword, a fierce flame, and a handsome face—no wonder you could shake the Immortal Sect and escape unscathed in just a year. Truly, a prodigy."*  

Her tone carried admiration. *"Since you've left the sect, the world offers you no refuge. If you submit to me, I shall grant you my protection!"*  

*"Protection?"*  

Li Zhengjing's heart stirred. *"The way she said 'protection'... it didn't sound very proper?"*  

*"Her former self was the Heavenly Balance King. After taking over the divine form, she became the Divine Mother of the Southern Domain. The first Divine Mother was originally a female immortal!"*  

The Buddha Child whispered, his expression odd. *"And as one of the Six Divine Mothers of the Southern Domain, her domain includes love and desire. After eight hundred years of worship, her consciousness has been reshaped... She's no longer the Heavenly Balance King, but the true Divine Mother. In my opinion, she's taken a liking to you."*  

*"This is a serious moment—stop joking!"*  

Li Zhengjing snapped.  

The Buddha Child clasped his hands. *"This monk does not lie."*  

Li Zhengjing's throat went dry. Looking up, he saw the previously furious Divine Mother now gazing at him with appreciation.  

It seemed his Blazing Sun Divine Sword had... pleased her.  

*"I'll give you a moment to consider. Refuse, and you shall perish!"*  

*"Well..."* Li Zhengjing hesitated. *"I'd need to discuss this with my family. My daughter, my grandson..."*  

*"You have children?"* The Divine Mother was stunned, then her eyes flashed with anger.  

*"Of course."* Li Zhengjing pulled the little dragon girl forward. *"Look at her—"*  

*"A'Li!"* The girl suddenly spoke in an ancient tongue, but everyone understood her meaning.  

*Agreed!*  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing let go of her hand and spat. *"I raised you for nothing."*  

At that moment, the Five Elements Creation Tree extended a root from the Parasol Wood Box and spoke.  

*"Whatever Master wishes, this grandson naturally supports! Besides, she is a deity—barely worthy of you..."*  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing ignored it, already planning to cook the tree into medicinal paste tonight.  

Gu Changzhou stepped forward. *"Since your family approves, why not accept? If we fight, we might not win. And if Lin Yuan Prefecture is destroyed, countless will die. For the greater good—"*  

*THUD!*  

Li Zhengjing kicked him to the ground.  

The Buddha Child wisely kept his mouth shut.  

The Divine Mother's voice descended once more.  

*"Time's up. Have you decided?"*  

*"I'd need to consult my wife first."* Li Zhengjing said. *"As a divine being, you no longer have a fleshly body. How would we have children? My wife would need to bear my heirs. Would you serve her during her confinement? And my daughter and grandson—would you treat them as your own?"*  

*"You have a wife?"* The Divine Mother's eyes blazed, the clouds around her burning like fire.  

*"No, I don't."*  

*"Then why mention consulting her?"*  

*"Exactly. No wife means no discussion!"*  

Li Zhengjing spread his hands, then drew the Dragon-Patterned Saber and slashed upward!  

A bolt of lightning surged from the ground, striking the Divine Mother in the sky!  

At the same time, Li Zhengjing soared into the air, his mana erupting outward!  

*"Human Immortal?!"*  

Shock rippled through the crowd—the Divine Mother, the Wan Clan, Gu Changzhou, and even the Buddha Child were stunned.  

In that instant, Li Zhengjing's mana surged like a tempest, soaring through the clouds with the might of a Human Immortal!  

No wonder he had escaped the Feather Transformation Sect's territory!  

No wonder he dared face the Divine Mother without fear!  

He possessed the power to challenge a deity!  

*"He truly cultivated for only a year?"*  

Gu Changzhou turned to the Buddha Child, his expression complex.  

The Buddha Child shook his head. *"A month ago, he was still at the Internal Qi realm. How has he reached Human Immortal strength in such a short time?"*  

Even the Kunlun Sect's Young Master, hailed as the strongest of the younger generation and unrivaled beneath immortals, had yet to step into the Human Immortal realm!  

*"Unfathomable. If you hadn't arrived earlier, I might have tried to stop him—and died on the spot."*  

*"Didn't you obtain a treasure that boosted your strength?"*  

*"Not enough to match a Human Immortal or a god."*  

*"Then at least help him. If he loses, the Divine Mother won't spare Lin Yuan Prefecture."*  

Gu Changzhou hesitated, then nodded. *"Fine. Consider this repayment for our earlier conflict."*  

With that, he shot into the sky, his sword aimed at the Divine Mother!  

*"A mere True Qi cultivator dares challenge me?"*  

The Divine Mother roared. *"If I can't kill Li Zhengjing, I'll kill you first!"*  

Above the heavens, light clashed with flame, clouds swirling in dazzling hues.  

The people of Lin Yuan Prefecture knelt in worship, unaware that two men were preparing to slay a god!  

Li Zhengjing unleashed the Great Void Sword Qi, suppressing the Divine Mother while hurling lightning with his saber.  

His left arm's divine ability lay dormant—after one strike, the Divine Mother was wary, leaving no opening.  

Gu Changzhou's sudden intervention surprised him.  

*"A True Qi cultivator joining this fight?"* Yuan Zhengfeng murmured. *"Ah—he has an immortal treasure!"*  

A hundred-zhang golden dragon materialized behind Gu Changzhou, its aura overwhelming.  

*"The Great Zhou's Imperial Dragon Pillar?!"*  

The Divine Mother paled. *"Only the imperial family knows the activation method. Has the court sent you to kill me?"*  

Fury burned in her heart. *"I served the Great Zhou for centuries, even helping the founding emperor repel invaders 800 years ago—only to be betrayed now?!"*
