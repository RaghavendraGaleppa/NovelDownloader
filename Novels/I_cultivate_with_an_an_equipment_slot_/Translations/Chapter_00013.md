# Chapter 13: A Promising Spiritual Planter

If it were any other restriction, Zhang Yan might not have been able to meet it. But if it was about being a Spiritual Planter—well, that was just perfect. The spiritual hoe Old Lin had given him had an attribute called "Spiritual Plant Cultivation," which essentially qualified him as a Spiritual Planter.  

Thinking of this, he directly addressed the disciple in charge, "I am a Spiritual Planter."  

"Huh?"  

The disciple, who had been sitting at the desk with an indifferent expression, immediately stood up upon hearing this. He looked at Zhang Yan in disbelief. "You're saying you're a Spiritual Planter?"  

"That's right," Zhang Yan nodded lightly.  

The commotion drew the attention of many cultivators in the Hall of Affairs. Their sharp senses picked up the conversation instantly.  

"He's a Spiritual Planter?"  
"How is that possible?"  
"He looks no older than fourteen or fifteen!"  
"And his cultivation is only at the first layer of Qi Refinement—how could he be a Spiritual Planter?"  

Whispers spread through the hall.  

Though Spiritual Planting was one of the most commonly chosen professions among cultivators, that didn't mean it was easy. Quite the opposite—because so many chose this path, the competition was fiercer than in other professions.  

In other fields, a success rate of thirty percent might be enough to qualify as a beginner. But for Spiritual Planters, fifty percent was the bare minimum, and some even required seventy percent to be considered proficient.  

As a result, many cultivators who chose this path never truly became Spiritual Planters. They either ended up as mere spiritual farmers or switched to other professions.  

That was why Zhang Yan's claim was met with such skepticism.  

So young.  
So low in cultivation.  
How could he possibly be a Spiritual Planter?  

In everyone's minds, a Spiritual Planter had to be at least at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement or a white-haired elder. Spiritual plants grew slowly—even the fastest-growing spiritual rice took four months to mature. A young, low-level cultivator simply wouldn't have enough experience.  

Under such circumstances, how could he possibly qualify?  

"You say you're a Spiritual Planter—then are you willing to take the assessment?" the disciple from the Hall of Affairs asked, though he clearly doubted Zhang Yan's claim.  

"Of course," Zhang Yan replied without hesitation.  

The assessment for Spiritual Planters wasn't commonly used. After all, over time, everyone knew which spiritual farmers were truly skilled.  

For example, some farmers consistently harvested more from the same plot of spiritual land than others.  

Or when tending to the same medicinal herbs, some could make them mature faster and with better potency, while others couldn't even keep them alive.  

In such cases, the exceptional ones naturally earned the title of Spiritual Planter.  

But there were also cases like Zhang Yan's—young, inexperienced, yet innately gifted in the art of spiritual planting.  

When others didn't believe, what could be done?  

That was where the assessment came in.  

And the test for Spiritual Planters was straightforward: the care and healing of spiritual plants.  

"Since you're willing to take the assessment, follow me."  

The disciple immediately perked up with interest and led Zhang Yan to the back courtyard, entering a curtained room.  

"Elder, a disciple has come to be certified as a Spiritual Planter."  

"Let him in."  

A hoarse, aged voice responded from inside.  

"Go ahead, Junior Brother. I need to return to the Hall of Affairs."  

"Thank you, Senior Brother."  

Zhang Yan bowed slightly to the disciple before lifting the curtain and stepping inside cautiously.  

Beyond the curtain was a small, greenhouse-like space. Shelves lined the walls, holding trays of spiritual soil where tiny white sprouts grew.  

Zhang Yan sniffed the air—there was a faint, musty odor.  

"You're here to test as a Spiritual Planter?"  

The same aged voice spoke again.  

Zhang Yan looked down and saw a dwarf elder, barely three feet tall, standing before him. He had been so focused on examining the room that he hadn't noticed the elder at first.  

"Greetings, Elder. This disciple wishes to take the Spiritual Planter assessment."  

"First layer of Qi Refinement, and so young?" The dwarf elder's voice was cold. "Fine. Here's a simple test for you. These spiritual mushrooms in the room aren't doing well. Tell me what's wrong with them."  

His tone made it clear he didn't expect much from Zhang Yan.  

"Understood!"  

Without hesitation, Zhang Yan began inspecting the mushrooms.  

The dwarf elder watched him with detached amusement.  

The room was filled with a specific type of spiritual mushroom. They had been growing normally until recently, when many had suddenly started rotting.  

The elder had been assigned by the sect to investigate but hadn't found the cause yet. When Zhang Yan arrived for the assessment, he saw an opportunity to vent his frustration by making the boy tackle the problem.  

He had little patience for those who treated the Spiritual Planter assessment as a joke.  

Unaware of the elder's thoughts, Zhang Yan carefully examined the mushrooms.  

"Is it due to contamination?"  

Recalling knowledge from his past life, Zhang Yan realized the mushrooms were likely infected by foreign fungi—or in this world's terms, "evil qi intrusion."  

And this—he could handle.  

Finding an infected mushroom, Zhang Yan extended a finger and flicked it.  

A flash of spiritual light severed half the mushroom.  

"Boy! What are you doing?!"  

The dwarf elder exploded in anger, leaping up to Zhang Yan's chest height. His face twisted with fury.  

"Please wait, Elder. I can heal this."  

Zhang Yan remained unperturbed. His only goal was to cure the mushrooms.  

"Fine! I'll watch you try! If you fail, I'll deduct your spirit stones as punishment!" the elder snapped.  

"Very well."  

Calmly, Zhang Yan activated the Wood Element Technique. A verdant glow emanated from his hands.  

"Hmm?"  

"Small Achievement in the Wood Element Technique?"  

The elder's eyes widened.  

As the most fundamental and essential technique for Spiritual Planters, he recognized it instantly. Normally, he wouldn't have reacted to someone using it—but this boy was only in his teens and at the first layer of Qi Refinement!  

Yet he had already reached Small Achievement?!  

What kind of talent was this?  

"With this level of mastery in the Wood Element Technique alone, he's more than qualified to be a Spiritual Planter," the elder thought.  

At such a young age, mastering this technique—this boy was undoubtedly a prodigy in spiritual planting!
