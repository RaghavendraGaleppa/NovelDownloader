# Chapter 38: A Windfall

However, the harvest didn't end there.

The green-robed female cultivator's bamboo leaf artifact was probably worth about six hundred spirit coins. Though her green robe was damaged, it could still be repaired by an artificer and should fetch at least a hundred spirit coins.

As for the mid-grade white jade pendant with seventeen artifact restrictions—its value was staggering. All the previous low-grade magical artifacts combined might not match its worth!

A brand new mid-grade artifact started at three thousand spirit coins, with each additional restriction adding another hundred coins. Being a defensive artifact, it commanded a slight premium. This seventeen-restriction white jade pendant could easily sell for five thousand spirit coins.

This item wasn't something the green-robed woman had refined herself—it was one of the heirlooms from her family. When her clan fell apart, she had secretly taken it for protection.

After some thought, Wang Chan placed the white jade pendant and the white mask into his personal storage pouch. He decided not to sell these two items but to refine them for his own use. In these wild lands, mid-grade defensive artifacts were hard to come by, even with money.

The white mask, though not as valuable as the mid-grade artifact, was a fully restricted low-grade item called the "White Ghost Mask." Crafted from the hide of a shape-shifting ghost and imbued with transformation restrictions, it could alter one's aura, appearance, and physique—perfect for unsavory dealings.

The set of paired flying daggers, named "Butterfly Blades," far exceeded ordinary low-grade artifacts with their twenty-seven restrictions. According to the diary, the green-robed woman hadn't refined these herself either—she'd obtained them by murdering a fellow female cultivator during her journey to the White Mountain region. 

Killing her with two punches had been no injustice.

Though the Butterfly Blades had a pleasant name and elegant appearance, Wang Chan intended to refine them for show. After all, his needles were meant for healing—he preferred not to use them openly for combat. He'd already stored them away.

Though other spoils remained to be sorted, Wang Chan couldn't suppress his joy. While not as ecstatic as before, the thought of acquiring in mere moments what would take an ordinary early Qi Refining cultivator decades to accumulate filled him with awe.

"Truly, horses don't grow fat without night grazing, and men don't get rich without windfalls... No wonder so many risk becoming bandit cultivators..."

Yet Wang Chan had no intention of turning bandit himself. Such lawless ventures were no different from gambling with one's head. Those who frequented the riverbanks would eventually get their feet wet—this path led only to ruin. More importantly, with his bright future ahead, steady progress would suffice. There was no need to risk everything for mere wealth.

Reflecting on the recent encounter, he reconsidered his approach. Though the bald bandit and green-robed woman had been no match for him in direct combat, their cunning and methods had given him pause.

"There's always someone better, and skies beyond skies—complacency has no place."

Taking a deep breath, Wang Chan calmed himself and stored the remaining artifacts in a new storage pouch. As he handled them, his panel had prompted whether to register these artifacts for potential upgrades, but none had impressed him—not even the mid-grade artifact.

A glance at his artifact slots showed:
Artifacts (1/3): Minor Withering-Bliss Needles (low-grade, 21/21, fully restricted, deified)

With only three artifact slots total and one already occupied by his needles, the remaining two had to be chosen meticulously.

Turning his attention to the talismans, he found three mid-grade ones: a twelve-restriction protective charm, a thirteen-restriction wind-walking charm, and a fifteen-restriction golden sword charm. 

There were also 432 spirit coins, their chaotic and varied auras indicating they'd been collected from numerous victims—clear evidence of the bandits' recent activities. Ten coins contained hidden toxins. Had Wang Chan not cautiously used a qi-hand to handle them and immediately purified them with his needles, he might have fallen prey.

Recalling their last encounter, he shuddered—the bald man had tossed him exactly ten coins back then, undoubtedly these poisoned ones. As the texts warned, bandit cultivators stopped at nothing.

Other miscellaneous items—spirit liquids, jade books, and assorted materials—totaled about thirty spirit coins in value. But as for cultivation manuals, spell jades, or skill inheritances? Not a single fragment.

Not from the bandits, nor even the green-robed woman's storage pouch. Wang Chan chuckled wryly at his earlier hope of obtaining such treasures from three bandits. 

"Knowledge isn't lightly given," he mused. "Without fate's favor, one might die without encountering such things. You could rob a hundred people and still not find them on the hundred and first."

Unless, by some absurd luck, he robbed someone like Qu Lian.

With the inventory complete, Wang Chan patted his bulging storage pouch with satisfaction. He was now a man of considerable means.

"Just when I needed it most, fortune delivers," he murmured, storing the remaining items. His lips curled into an irrepressible smile.

Strangely, after killing those four, his spiritual and physical energies had surged with excitement, as if electrified. But in his focus on the spoils, he'd barely noticed. Now, the sensation had vanished.

"Could it relate to combat... or killing?" 

Pondering, Wang Chan realized this was the day's unique element—he'd killed. For the first time in this world, he'd taken lives. Four at once.

Recalling the moments, he couldn't deny the exhilaration that had erupted from his very bones and soul when crushing them—an addictive thrill that made him crave slaughtering a hundred more. 

Fear? Guilt? 

Absurdly, they'd never appeared. Yet when he'd first arrived in this world, he'd trembled nightly with terror.

"Craving murder... I must be ill," Wang Chan muttered, bowing his head in silence.

Moments later, a golden koi swam into view, weaving through aquatic plants with spirited grace. Given opportunity, it might one day leap the dragon gate. But its splashing stirred irritation.

A sudden burst of qi pierced the fish, leaving it floating belly-up among the reeds.

Gazing at the finally still koi, Wang Chan's resolve solidified.

"I'm a demonic cultivator. Shouldn't demonic cultivators revel in slaughter?"

Rising with newfound lightness, he exhaled.
