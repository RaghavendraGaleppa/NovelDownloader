# Chapter 105: The Immortal-Beating Stone, A Powerful Demonic Celestial Comparable to a Red Dust Immortal

Buddha Child pulled up trees while shuttling them back and forth to the Mountain Sea World. Shen Yin, meanwhile, absorbed the essence of the wood qi without restraint, feasting freely. The two advanced along the way, quickly penetrating ten li, and the area within ten li became empty.

Yang Ji's gaze, fixed on his surroundings, suddenly sharpened. He quickly sent a voice transmission to Shen Yin and Buddha Child: "Quick, stop." As he spoke, he too flew over.

"Venerable Master, what's wrong?" Buddha Child asked, still embracing a large tree, glancing over with a puzzled expression.

"What's wrong, Big Brother?" Shen Yin tilted her head slightly, her eyes flickering with green light, still gnawing on a Vajra wood.

"Shhh!" Yang Ji made a shushing gesture, then pointed at a calf-sized stone ahead. His heart pounded at that moment; this inconspicuous stone before him actually displayed: [High-grade Dao Artifact, Immortal-Beating Stone, currently in slumber.]

A high-grade Dao Artifact? The Immortal-Beating Stone? Yang Ji's breath caught in his throat. It was truly unbelievable that a Dao artifact was just lying there in such an inconspicuous spot, sleeping on a vine? They say Hao Yun, a true disciple, has profound luck, even picking up treasure artifacts just by stepping out. So, picking up a Dao artifact just by stepping out, what would that even count as?

"Venerable Master, is there anything special about this stone?" Buddha Child asked via voice transmission, seeing Yang Ji show a rare expression of surprise.

"A high-grade Dao artifact!" Yang Ji took a deep breath, calming his turbulent emotions, pointed at the stone, and transmitted.

"What? This ordinary-looking stone is actually a high-grade Dao artifact?" Buddha Child was greatly astonished, his eyes blazing with excitement as he stared fixedly at it, transmitting excitedly, "We're rich, Venerable Master! A material capable of forging a high-grade Dao artifact can sell for billions, even tens of billions, of celestial pills. So, how many pills would a complete Dao artifact be worth?"

"This big stone is a Dao artifact?" Shen Yin was the calmest. She seemed uninterested in such matters, merely tilting her head and blinking her small eyes, casting a curious glance as she transmitted.

"Venerable Master, this place is not simple! Not only are there 100,000-year-old Vajra wood, but we can also see scattered Dao artifacts. My heavens, what kind of place is this?" Buddha Child transmitted, surveying his surroundings with astonishment.

Yang Ji also continuously gazed at his surroundings. This place was vast, stretching endlessly out of sight, an unknown mysterious land, so much so that he dared not explore too far forward. Even with his cheat ability, it wouldn't work. Because looking forward, the scope of his vision was too vast, and countless pieces of information, like code, wildly sprang forth, filling his eyes. Every tree, even every speck of dust, was a piece of information. One could imagine how immense it was.

He still had to filter the useful information himself, and because he saw too many things, even though his divine soul had reached the Yang God realm, he still had a splitting headache and dared not look for too long or absorb too much information. Therefore, he generally only selectively looked at a specific object or a particular area. As for the unknown depths ahead, because the area was too vast and the field of vision too wide, he only dared to glance roughly, thus some unknown dangers could not be seen. Only by advancing his gaze mile by mile, with all information exposed wherever his eyes passed, would he dare to proceed boldly and confidently.

Because the path ahead was unknown, he only dared to linger at the edge and not delve deeper. He hadn't expected that this fringe area would actually contain an Immortal-Beating Stone. A high-grade Dao artifact! It was simply like a dream.

Yang Ji gestured with his eyes, indicating that they should even hold their breath to avoid making any noise.

"Venerable Master, what should we do now?" Buddha Child asked via voice transmission.

"What else can we do? Since we've encountered it, we must acquire it," Yang Ji transmitted. "Don't make a sound. I'll carefully move it into the Mountain Sea World. Even if I can't subdue it, we'll go back and ask the sect's experts for help. I don't think they would covet a disciple's fortune." Of course, this was a last resort. Who wouldn't be envious of even a low-grade Dao artifact placed right before their eyes? Even if he couldn't subdue it, he wanted to take it. Moreover, it was still sleeping; this was an opportunity for him.

Light shimmered in Yang Ji's eyes as he slowly approached in mid-air. But suddenly, with a 'crack' sound, the vines supporting the large stone scattered into a pile of dull wood chips. The large stone, following the momentum, landed on the ground with a 'thump'.

Yang Ji's heart tightened. Seeing the rotten wood chips, he subconsciously looked at Shen Yin. Shen Yin sheepishly stuck out her tongue, transmitting apologetically: "I absorbed too quickly just now and accidentally absorbed those vines too. I didn't realize the stone they were supporting was a Dao artifact!"

"Fortunately, this fellow sleeps deeply, otherwise—" Before Buddha Child finished speaking, the stone on the ground began to vibrate slightly. Large flakes of stone skin immediately fell off, revealing its gleaming, smooth, jade-like interior. And along with it, an ancient voice echoed: "Who's there? Who broke my bed?"

"Oh dear, my stony ancestor, who are you all?" As a piece of stone skin peeled off, two sleepy, large eyes suddenly appeared on the great stone. It startled, seeing Yang Ji and the others nearby, and with a jolt, quickly rolled back three times.

"We..." Yang Ji's expression flickered; he raised a hand, wanting to speak but stopping himself.

"Ha, I know! You're outsiders, aren't you?" The large stone, seeing the three clearly, rolled over again without shyness, its somewhat cloudy eyes wide as it scrutinized Yang Ji and the others.

"Yes, Senior, we stumbled in accidentally," Yang Ji chuckled. "We'll leave now and won't disturb Senior's sweet dream." A high-grade Dao artifact, and one with a spirit no less, could probably crush him to dust with a casual strike. Since he had missed his chance, he decided to retreat decisively. As he spoke, he signaled Buddha Child and Shen Yin to hide in the Mountain Sea World.

Just as he was preparing to retreat, the large stone suddenly murmured and called out to him: "You can leave? No, wait! How did you get in? The fog outside is endless, not only containing illusions but also death energy. How did you manage to enter here unscathed?"

"We just accidentally walked in. Farewell, Senior, we'll visit you again next time," Yang Ji said with a gentle smile, about to leave.

"Accidentally walked in? Hmph, you kid trying to fool me? I've eaten more stones than the spiritual energy in your body! And you dare try to deceive me? Speak, how did you get in? Otherwise, I'll sit on you and crush you to death!" The Immortal-Beating Stone suddenly flared its power, expanding in mid-air and hovering above Yang Ji's head, its body glowing with spiritual light, suddenly erupting with a vast and majestic force.

Yang Ji's heart skipped a beat. Seeing no hostility above its head, he took a deep breath, calmed himself, and smiled slightly: "Senior, I truly did stumble in by accident. If you don't believe me, I can take you out and walk through it again."

"Oh? Looking at your composed demeanor, it seems you truly have a way to come and go freely?" The Immortal-Beating Stone's spiritual light receded, and it suddenly shrank again, hovering before Yang Ji, scrutinizing him. It secretly thought: "This kid actually has a way out, something even I can't do. Hmm, I'd better stabilize him first."

Seeing this, Yang Ji felt a wave of relief while his eyes lit up. He coaxed and tricked: "Senior, if you wish to go out, this junior can guide you. The outside world is much larger; you're truly underutilized here. You should go out and let your brilliance shine!"

"This old ancestor is naturally brilliant, the brightest stone no matter where I go. Hmph! I see you have ulterior motives, trying to subdue this old ancestor? Watch me sit on you and crush you to death!" The Immortal-Beating Stone, wise from its age, instantly saw through Yang Ji's hidden thoughts. Immediately, the words [Intimidation] appeared above its head, and its form once again expanded, hovering above Yang Ji's head, erupting with boundless might.

But at this moment, deep within this region, a muffled thunder-like rumbling suddenly echoed. Faintly, Yang Ji also heard the 'clanking!', 'clanking!' of iron chains rattling, accompanied by demonic low growls. A strange sound emanated from the depths of the secret realm. The Immortal-Beating Stone's gaze deepened, and it snorted lightly, seemingly losing interest in teasing Yang Ji, as it gazed towards the depths.

"Senior, what's in there?" Yang Ji asked with a solemn voice.

"A Demonic Celestial, a powerful Demonic Celestial comparable to a Red Dust Immortal."

"Hey, where are you going, kid?"

"Don't be scared, that Demonic Celestial is suppressed."

"Scared already? You little brat really have no courage at all, yet you want to subdue me." The Immortal-Beating Stone saw Yang Ji's expression change and him bolting away, so it quickly spoke to reassure him.
