# Chapter 51: Fusion! Bug-Grass Slayer

Late in the evening.

Ding Rui sat upright amidst the spirit fields. He had already completed almost all the work in the spirit fields for the day, with only the last few stalks of spirit rice remaining to be dealt with. He slowly exhaled, not planning to use skills to finish all the work directly, but intending to do it himself!

Half a month had passed since the incident with Matthew's tribe. Through half a month of practice and effort, he had almost fully cultivated the inertial memory of running both the [Insecticide] and [Weeding] skills simultaneously. Although his previous attempts had failed multiple times, he was constantly making progress. Today, he planned to try a few more times, and he had a premonition that he was not far from success!

"Hoo..."

Ding Rui slowly exhaled, clearing the skill bar from his mind. He reached out and placed one hand on a stalk of spirit rice in front of him, and the other on the weed beside it. The true essence of the Azure Wood Art and Golden Radiance Art immediately began to circulate rapidly, as smooth as fish swimming in water.

"Host detected to have comprehended a skill. Please choose whether to place the skill into a skill slot and name the skill!"

The familiar message appeared in his mind. Ding Rui opened his eyes, not daring to wait a moment, and immediately placed this newly condensed skill into a skill slot, setting the name he had long prepared.

**[Bug-Grass Slayer]**

A brand new, glowing skill was embedded in the skill bar, occupying one of its slots. At this point, all seven skill slots were completely filled. However, this situation could be improved immediately; Ding Rui only needed to discard the [Golden Radiance Spear] and [Weeding] skills.

But before doing so, he first controlled his emotions and walked over to the remaining stalk of spirit rice, sitting down beside it. Ding Rui's heart was pounding rapidly, and even his hands were trembling slightly. Yet, he still reached out and grasped the spirit rice stalk in front of him, placing his other hand on the weed. With wide-open eyes, he focused his thoughts and activated the [Bug-Grass Slayer] skill he had just comprehended.

Instantly, the true essence of both the Golden Radiance Art and Azure Wood Art automatically flowed out from his acupoints, smoothly and swiftly passing through his two hands, entering the spirit rice and the weed respectively. Next came the Golden Radiance Spear, locating the roots of the weed. It searched for aphids, then began to absorb the weed's spiritual energy. The Golden Radiance Spear began to battle the aphids. After absorbing the weed, the true essence of the Azure Wood Art returned to Ding Rui's palm. Ding Rui then moved the hand that had been on the weed to the spirit rice, and the Azure Wood Art's true essence immediately carried the spiritual energy absorbed from the weed into the interior of the spirit rice.

He didn't feel tired, but he just wanted to close his eyes for a moment. However, before closing his eyes, Ding Rui, with a thought, directly discarded the [Golden Radiance Spear] and [Weeding] skills from his skill bar. Two empty slots immediately reappeared in the previously full skill bar.

"Next, I can focus entirely on cultivating the 'Sun Condensation Art'," he mused. "Although I've spent a lot of energy and time on skill fusion recently, the 'Sun Condensation Art' has also made some progress. It shouldn't take long, at most a month, to successfully cultivate the 'Sun Condensation Art' and condense a skill. By then, I'll need to condense the [Sun Condensation] skill, and the two newly empty skill slots will be used up again."

"However, both the [Sun Condensation] skill and the [Rainfall] skill are for entire fields of spirit rice. I can try to fuse these two skills together, simply by adjusting the target spirit rice area to the same size."
