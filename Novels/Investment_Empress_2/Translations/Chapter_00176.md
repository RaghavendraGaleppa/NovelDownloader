# Chapter 176: Why Don't We Switch Opponents? Li Mo's Hands Are Itching!

On the stage.

The peach blossom branch was pressed against the warrior's throat. A fraction of an inch further, and it would draw blood.

*Gulp—* The man swallowed.

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Did I... scare you..."

Jiang Chulong hurriedly retracted her sword and bowed in apology.

"...."

The venue fell silent for a moment, then erupted into an uproar.

That warrior was no nameless nobody; he was a seasoned wandering mercenary.

Yet the young girl ended it with a single sword strike?

...

"Sword Intent?!"

On the high platform, the elders of the Hengyun Sword City slammed their tables and shot up, their eyes flashing with intense brilliance.

Judging by her age, she was at most fourteen or fifteen.

From ancient times to the present, they had never heard of anyone comprehending Sword Intent at such a young age.

Moreover, the girl's swordsmanship was devoid of any artificiality, as if naturally formed, as if carved by the craftsmanship of the heavens.

With such talent.

If she were to touch the Hengyun Sword Mark...

"Does she have a master?"

"So what? Which sword master in Yunzhou don't I know?"

"Exactly, it's better for this child to be taught by us. If her master objects, we'll go reason with him together!"

The elders of the Hengyun Sword City, all of whom were at least at the Outer Scene Realm, began to clamor.

Suddenly, an elder who hadn't spoken yet said, "I think... I've seen her at the Tianshan Sword Manor."

The elders fell silent.

...

"Junior Brother Bai, do you want to switch opponents with me?"

Cao Mu asked solemnly. He was a sword fanatic, and almost all the young generation in Yunzhou had been sought out by him for a duel.

"I don't want to fight her either, but..."

Bai Jinghong looked at Li Mo on the stage, then at Ying Bing, and gritted his teeth. "She... I'll leave her to me!"

"So tough?"

Wu Chushu was taken aback, looking at Bai Jinghong with newfound respect.

He thought Bai Jinghong had become timid and timid.

He didn't expect him to still have some backbone.

...

"Awesome, Chulong."

Li Mo gave a thumbs up in her direction.

Then he turned back to look at his opponent.

It was a young girl who looked like a delicate, petite beauty. She was looking at him with excitement, her eyes filled with heart-shaped sparkles.

"Jiang Chen... Jiang Chen big brother."

"...Actually, my name is Li Mo."

"Okay, Jiang Chen big brother, can you give me an autograph?"

"Ah?"

After getting the autograph, the young warrior directly jumped off the stage.

Li Mo: "...."

Wait, at least exchange a few moves!

I'm here to test my sword against the world, not to hold a book signing event!!

Whatever.

This situation probably won't last long.

After all, standing on the擂台 (arena) means having the qualification to enter the Sword Tower to observe the Hengyun Sword Mark.

...

Ying Bing's situation was a bit different.

It was a difference in character settings.

After all, in *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me*, Jiang Chen was a gentle gentleman, a bit simple-minded.

Liu Wuyan was the opposite.

"It is my honor to exchange moves with the Snow Moon Empress!"

"Even if I am defeated and die, I will have no regrets!"

The one who stepped onto the stage was a warrior at the Third Aperture of the Divine Observation Realm.

He was solemn and heroic, as if his opponent was truly a Martial Emperor.

Ying Bing: "...."

She said nothing. She slightly raised the unsheathed Frost, signaling the opponent to make a move.

The man did have some skill.

The moment he drew his sword, it had the momentum of surging waves, the sword light dazzling and full of changes.

Anyone who saw it would have to say, 'Good swordsmanship'.

The Raging Waves Sword Art, a superior sword art, used by this man to perfection, he had grasped its essence.

Not far away, Li Mo shook his head slightly:

---

"Twelve flaws."

Amidst the surging waves.

A glint of cold light struck, overbearing and strict, like divine punishment.

This sword strike made it hard for anyone to think of resisting.

The sword light spread, and the man's face turned pale as he fell to the ground with a *plop*.

As sweat poured down, he finally saw the opponent clearly.

The girl's sword hadn't even been unsheathed.

With just a starting stance, he felt as if he were facing a deity and collapsed without a fight.

A starting stance, also known as a starting form.

It was debatable whether this counted as a single exchange, but there was no doubt... this cold girl was terrifyingly strong.

Jiang Chulong's talent was shocking, but Ying Bing was terrifyingly strong, her strength completely defied reason.

...

"What sword qi, what sword momentum!"

"What sword art is she practicing? It doesn't look like a supreme technique..."

*Slam—*

The elders slammed their tables again.

*Crack!*

The table made of bluestone let out a groan, cracked, and collapsed with a *rumble*.

It was clear they were shocked.

It was also clear that Outer Scene experts had considerable grip strength.

...

"Cough... Old Cao."

Wu Chushu scratched his chin and said, "Why don't... we switch?"

"Good!"

Sword fanatic Cao Mu agreed without hesitation.

"Alright, then I'll duel that Jiang... Li Mo."

Wu Chushu finally let out a sigh of relief.

He wouldn't have to face Ying Bing or Jiang Chulong, so his face was saved.

Wu Chushu, who had narrowly escaped disaster, had no idea that Bai Jinghong was tactfully retreating, his gaze suddenly becoming respectful and awed.

"What's wrong, Junior Brother Bai?"

"Nothing. By the way, do you have any unfinished business? You can entrust it to me."

"Huh?"

Wu Chushu was confused and looked up at the stage.

He saw the white-clothed youth, who seemed to be getting tired of signing autographs, take out a wooden board from his spatial artifact, write something on it, and prop it up:

'For anyone who steps up and challenges me with full strength, a reward of one hundred taels of gold.'

'For anyone who defeats me, a reward of ten thousand taels of gold.'

Paying for a beating?

The crowd immediately burst into an uproar.

Ten thousand taels of gold, not silver, was a considerable fortune even for a Divine Observation Realm warrior.

Warriors without a background were all short on money.

"Senior Brother Li, what are you doing?" Shen Yunfei, standing on the arena, was confused.

The warriors on the arena all hoped to conserve their strength as much as possible.

After all, no one dared to say they could withstand a rotation of battles. Even though the Sword Trial was only during the day, they couldn't recover their depleted energy at night.

Did Senior Brother Li, like him, not plan to stand until the end?

Even Zhong Zhenyue on the next arena turned his head.

"One hundred taels of gold? Is it true?"

"Jiang... Big Brother Li Mo, is your hand sore from signing too much?"

"I've wanted to challenge him for a long time, but I just couldn't find the chance!"

"Hmph, pretty boy, I'm coming!"

A rather burly man stepped onto the stage. He was holding a large halberd, bare-chested, his muscles bulging.

The disciples of the Gangdou Sect believed in fighting like a man!

They hated pretentious people the most.

"Gangdou Sect?"

Li Mo recognized the man's style.

Instantly, he analyzed that the opponent was a body-refining warrior. The best way to deal with him was to max out the Extreme Weapon Mutilation Body.

But that way...

Ahem! The main thing is that it wouldn't train him!

Thinking about how he was about to show off... perform in front of all the heroes of Yunzhou as a swordsman, he felt a little excited.

"That's right, Tie Qi is my big brother!"

The man said proudly.

Li Mo smiled, swept his robe, his posture elegant and free, and made a gesture of invitation:

"Then let's keep it to a draw."

Little Li's hands were itching, eager to draw his sword!
