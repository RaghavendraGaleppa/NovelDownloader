# Chapter 3: Qi Cultivation Level One, Sect Benefits

"It actually has three attributes!"

He had initially thought it was just an ordinary hoe. But he hadn't expected it to have three attributes. One offensive attribute and two auxiliary attributes. Especially the two auxiliary ones would be of the greatest use to him. Not to mention, with these two attributes, his farming work would become much more comfortable. At the very least, he wouldn't accidentally uproot spiritual rice, mistaking it for weeds.

"Equip!"

Holding the spiritual hoe, Zhang Yan immediately equipped it without hesitation. After equipping it, a Transmission Jade Slip appeared in his hand again.

"Can I only have one item equipped at a time?"

Seeing the Transmission Jade Slip in his hand, Zhang Yan understood.

"Equip!"

He tried to switch equipment, attempting to equip the Transmission Jade Slip. But unfortunately, the Transmission Jade Slip remained in his hand.

"This means there's a cooldown for switching equipment. I just don't know the exact duration. However, I had only equipped the Transmission Jade Slip yesterday, and today I could switch to the spiritual hoe, so the cooldown period definitely wouldn't exceed one day."

Zhang Yan pondered. Although this cheat-like ability had its limitations, it was still acceptable.

After all, it was Zhang Yan's first time working. Elder Lin had thought Zhang Yan would need a few days to get familiar with it. Unexpectedly, on his first day of work, Zhang Yan single-handedly hoed five *mu* of land! What was even more impressive was that all the weeds were completely removed, and not a single spiritual rice plant was damaged.

"You've got a talent for plant cultivation, kid! You might even become a Spiritual Plant Master!" Elder Lin patted Zhang Yan's shoulder and said earnestly.

Cultivation wasn't just about fighting and killing; it was also about social relations, a new kind of social structure. For ordinary people to survive in the cultivation world, they had to master a skill. These were the so-called Hundred Arts of Cultivation. Among the more famous ones were Alchemy, Artifact Forging, Formation Arts, and Talisman Crafting. However, these four were known as the 'Upper Four Arts.' They had stringent requirements. Not only did they require talent, but also heritage and sufficient resources to learn. These were completely beyond the reach of ordinary cultivators. Only powerful aristocratic families and exceptionally talented disciples had the qualifications to learn them.

While becoming a Spiritual Plant Master was tempting, Zhang Yan knew that cultivation level was the most crucial aspect for him.

"Switch!"

As his voice faded, the Transmission Jade Slip in his hand vanished, replaced by a spiritual hoe.

"So it takes roughly six *shichen* to switch?" He estimated the time. Zhang Yan nodded slightly. Although this duration wasn't short, it wouldn't hinder his cultivation. With this thought, he immediately began to cultivate.

...

Thus, in the blink of an eye, two months passed. During these two months, he did nothing but cultivate and weed the spiritual fields, causing him to lose a significant amount of weight.

On this particular day, Zhang Yan was still cultivating. Sitting cross-legged on a meditation cushion, the surrounding spiritual energy was continuously drawn into his body. The thread-like spiritual energy within his body circulated and surged along its predetermined path.
