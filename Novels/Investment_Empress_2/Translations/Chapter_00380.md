# Chapter 380: The Broken Axe Mountain, The Unfinished Game

In the Li Mansion of Qinghe County.

Though fine snow drifted through the night, a clear beam of moonlight pierced through the dark clouds, casting a layer of frost over the guest room.

It also brought with it scenes from a thousand miles away—the scene inside the Xiyangyang Hotpot Restaurant.

The seventeen-year-old girl, bathed in the moonlight, quietly gazed at the light and shadows before her.

"Dream God..."

Ying Bing's eyes, reflecting the moonlight, rippled slightly.

She knew this was one of the Three Ancestral Gods worshipped by the Summoning Demon Sect.

But in her memories, the Dream God had always been dormant, and there had never been any news of its awakening.

In her previous life, after entering the Qingyuan Sect, she had weathered countless storms. By the time she returned to Qinghe County, she was already at the Profound Mastery Realm and the Master of the桂宫 (Guigong).

Even when she returned to Qinghe County as a Profound Mastery expert, she hadn't encountered that black Nian Beast...

Could it be that the one truly looking for her was the Dream God?

She had only intended to use the vision of her past life to act as a safeguard for Li Mo. She never expected that, after twists and turns, it would once again seem connected to the matter of the Ying family's massacre...

"Whether there's a connection or not, I can only take it one step at a time."

Ying Bing suppressed the turbulent thoughts in her heart and continued to look at the projection.

But after seeing what was happening inside, her furrowed brows relaxed into a helpless expression.

He really could spin a tale.

And she had to help him spin it.

This was the second time the Cold Fairy had helped him deceive the Summoning Demon Sect; she was already getting used to it.

In the projection of the moonlight.

"Since we've all agreed, then we'll set off after we finish eating... hmm?"

Luo Yexian reached out with his chopsticks, only to find that all six dishes on the table were empty.

"Who ate so fast?"

"Huh? I ordered quite a few dishes."

Li Mo wiped his mouth with a serious expression.

As everyone knew, Student Li was a genius with strong learning abilities. He often dined with Elder Qian in Yunzhou and had already received a third of his true legacy.

"In that case, there's no time to lose. Let's set off immediately."

"But we haven't eaten yet... Ahem, important matters take precedence."

"Waiter, the bill."

"Brother Luo is too generous."

Li Mo thanked him with a smile.

Luo Yexian was stunned. He had only called the waiter; he never said he would pay the bill.

But since Immortal Heitu had already thanked him, he had no choice but to take out the silver.

As the group walked out, Luo Yexian continued to speak flattering words:

"You're being too formal. Why thank me? Our two organizations have deep ties; we are family."

"Hahaha, that's right. Brother Luo, why don't we call each other brothers from now on?"

Immortal Heitu was in a fine mood.

He was full, didn't spend a cent, and even earned ten taels of silver—how could he not be in a good mood?

"Brother, I have drifted for half my life. The moment I saw you, I felt like I was seeing a long-lost elder brother."

Luo Yexian, skilled in making connections, was moved to tears.

"Nephew, quickly, call him Uncle."

Tan Zhuyin: "?"

He had just gone to the restroom to discuss matters with the two Body Transformation experts.

How was it that after a trip to the latrine, his generation had been demoted?

He looked at the middle-aged, graying-bearded Luo Yexian, then at the youth-like Immortal Heitu. He couldn't understand how his unfortunate brother-in-law's brother could be addressed as such.

Are you two even from the same generation?

"Big Nephew, this senior's age might be like his cultivation realm—not what it appears. We might actually be the ones gaining an advantage."

Luo Yexian felt no psychological burden in calling him brother.

Tan Zhuyin frowned and shot him a glare, then said seriously.

"To Broken Axe Mountain is about five hundred miles. We should set off now."

"Hmph, kids are thin-skinned. As people beyond the mortal world, why bother with secular titles?"

---

"Let's go."

As Li Mo spoke, he asked the moon in his heart.

"Ice Cube, what kind of teleportation technique would look like it belongs to a great expert?"

His imagination was certainly up to the task.

But with two Body Transformation experts secretly watching, he had to follow the basic laws of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths when showing off his divine powers. Otherwise, it would be too grandiose and might raise suspicion.

"Experts of the Penglai Star Sect can step on the Seven Stars."

"The Tianshan Sword Manor usually travels on swords, able to summon ten thousand swords with a single breath."

"If a cultivator has reached the Body Transformation realm with the Great Yin Divine Will, they can turn their body into moonlight..."

Li Mo listened as the Ice Cube whispered softly in his ear as he walked down the stairs.

He understood roughly.

It meant it had to conform to a certain kind of divine will.

Outside the hotpot restaurant.

Summoning Demon Son Tan Zhuyin boarded a palanquin, carried by sect members to fly through the air. Each bearer was actually an Inner Scene expert.

要知道 (To know that) the elders of the Qingyuan Sect were only at the Inner Scene realm shows the extravagance of this Summoning Demon Son.

Luo Yexian whistled, and a vulture several zhang long descended. It looked fierce and was clearly no good creature.

"Immortal Heitu... Brother, my bird is big enough for you to ride."

Luo Yexian invited Li Mo to mount it.

"It's alright."

The Shen God Pearl in Li Mo's chest trembled.

Roar—

Accompanied by a phoenix cry, a dazzling streak of light shot down from the blue sky, circling in the air. Its magnificent feathers rippled with moonlight, and a gentle breeze was born and died around it.

Its pressure covered the sky, standing above all living things.

Its nobility was like the embodiment of the moon.

A Phoenix.

To be precise, it was a type of True Phoenix.

A Moon Phoenix.

Ice Cube: "..."

Immortal Heitu stepped onto the Moon Phoenix in a single movement. The immortal riding the Moon Phoenix under the moonlight spoke calmly:

"This Seat has no intention of attracting attention, but since we are going to the place of the Dream God's inheritance, we must be solemn. Let's go."

As his words fell.

The Moon Phoenix soared into the sky, like another moon crossing the firmament. Every time it flapped its wings, it scattered specks of starlight.

"Wow, this is Brother Heitu's style."

Luo Yexian clicked his tongue, feeling a hint of regret.

He wished he hadn't called him brother...

He should have called him Father!

"Existences not inferior to True Dragons during the Great Shang Dynasty."

Tan Zhuyin watched the ethereal figure ride the Phoenix away, his eyes filled with a strong longing.

An hour later.

In the snowy clouds, the group began to descend. The outlines of the small mountains below began to appear, also shrouded in a sea of clouds, making it hard to distinguish between heaven and earth.

They landed on a mountaintop within the sea of clouds.

"In fact, we knew long ago that Broken Axe Mountain might be related to the Dream God's inheritance."

Tan Zhuyin looked at the clouds below and said slowly:

"It's just that the Ancestral God did not respond, so we did not dare to disturb."

More like you couldn't find the way in.

Li Mo didn't expose him, but just looked at the continuous Broken Axe Mountain range. In the dark night, it was square and orderly, with mountains rising and falling.

"Immortal, what do you think this mountain range's Feng Shui resembles?"

Although Student Li had said he would make a slight move, he knew nothing about Feng Shui.

Fortunately, the Ice Cube's jade thighs were indeed good to hold.

Li Mo glanced at the moon and said淡淡ly:

"A game of chess, an unfinished game."
