# Chapter 58: I Have a Sword, Please Observe

Yang Ji gazed at the square-arranged sword dao scripture before him.

His heart filled with emotion. This comprehensive scripture provided clear guidance. He no longer had to struggle aimlessly as he did when comprehending the sword dao imprints.

The Xun Sword Dao focuses on wind. Its sword intent imbues the essence of wind: gentle, frenzied, and endlessly变幻 (ever-changing). With his 'golden finger,' Yang Ji continuously comprehended and corrected his understanding. In a mere eight days, he had already achieved initial mastery. Besides the Fire Elephant Sword Intent, a translucent, sword-shaped rune, a nascent seed of Xun Wind Sword Intent, now coalesced in his mind.

A spiritual light flashed in Yang Ji’s palm, and True Steel spiritual energy slowly surged forth, forming a spiritual energy sword in his hand. The moment this sword was infused with Xun Wind Sword Intent, it not only became sharper but also gained a trace of the wind's agility. When he thrust the sword, it moved like a wisp of wind, swift and fleeting, striking from all directions, its trajectory elusive. At other times, it resembled an enraged dragon roaring, rampant and overbearing, tearing through the sky. This sword could be light or heavy, slow or fast, its angles tricky. Light as a gossamer thread, its trail was hard to find; heavy enough to shatter stone, it could devastate all in its path. This was the ever-changing Xun Sword Dao.

Even from this initial attempt, Yang Ji could sense the formidable power of the Xun Sword Dao, which greatly pleased him. He then set it aside, and with a flick of his hand, took out another jade slip containing the Zhen Sword Dao. As before, he immersed his divine sense into the jade slip's space to glean the mysteries of the Zhen Sword Dao. A grand Daoist chant resonated in his ears.

"The Zhen Sword Dao. 'Zhen' represents thunder and lightning, possessing immense power, but only for an instant. Thus, this sword art has only one move: if it doesn't strike, so be it, but once it strikes, nothing can withstand it. Its ruthlessness and swiftness make it paramount among the Guicang Sword Arts."

The sword dao text appeared before his eyes. Yang Ji pondered for a while and discovered that the Zhen Sword Dao bore some resemblance to the single strike of the Circulating Water Sword Art. Both consisted of just one strike, but that strike was an all-out effort, with the momentum of a galloping thunderclap and the speed of lightning. The sword struck like a dragon, grand and sweeping, capturing the awe-inspiring might of thunder, a fearless strike, magnificent and domineering. With the aid of his 'golden finger,' Yang Ji quickly achieved initial mastery. Again, in eight days, he condensed a nascent seed of Zhen Sword Intent.

Following the same pattern, after condensing the Zhen Sword Intent, Yang Ji retrieved another jade slip—his last one—which contained the Dui Sword Dao. As his divine sense entered, the Daoist chant emerged.

"The Dui Sword Dao. 'Dui' signifies a marsh. Once unleashed, it often causes the opponent's attacks to sink as if into a mire, dissipating into nothingness. The Dui Sword Dao is typically used in conjunction with the Gen Sword Dao. When mountain and marsh are combined, one direct and one strange, one heavy and one trapping, it becomes incredibly difficult to resist."

To Yang Ji, the Dui Sword Dao felt remarkably familiar, finding it seven-tenths similar to the sword qi vortex within the Circulating Water Sword Art.

Eight days later, having comprehended the Dui Sword Intent, he thrust his sword. Streaks of sword qi gathered and dispersed, intertwining as they shot forward, like climbing pythons, tearing and dragging their targets into a trap.

Thus, in just one month, all four sword daos were initially mastered, and their respective sword intents had coalesced. At this point, he had fulfilled the White-Browed Venerable’s requirement: mastering all four sword daos. Only a month had passed. If the White-Browed Venerable knew, Yang Ji wondered what his reaction would be.

Yang Ji, however, was not in a hurry to show off. Instead, he immersed himself in comprehending and enhancing the various sword intents. Cultivation knows no time, and a year passed in a flash.

On this day, Jian Yuanzi's voice reached Yang Ji's ears. "Disciple, a year has passed. The Venerable himself has called for a meeting for you. How has your cultivation progressed?"

Upon hearing this, Yang Ji opened his eyes. Sword light surged in his pupils but quickly receded. He rose and pushed open the door, seeing Jian Yuanzi’s expectant yet slightly nervous gaze. He smiled faintly. "Master, don't worry. I'll take both Spirit Cleansing Pills."

As he spread his palm, three sword intents instantly appeared, causing the surrounding air to churn rapidly, transforming into numerous flying swords that whistled back and forth.

"This is Xun Wind Sword Intent, Zhen Sword Intent, and Dui Sword Intent! My disciple hasn't disappointed me!" Jian Yuanzi breathed a sigh of relief, greatly relieved. He immediately grabbed Yang Ji and, with a flash, they teleported out of the main hall, flying towards the Council Hall.

The two entered swiftly, and Jian Yuanzi took his seat. Yang Ji stood in the center of the hall, where the White-Browed Venerable and other Nascent Soul True Monarchs were already seated, waiting, at the head and on all sides.

"Greetings, Grandmaster! Greetings, Martial Uncles and Aunts!" Yang Ji respectfully bowed.

"Little Ji, how has your cultivation been? Have you comprehended the other three sword intents?" The White-Browed Venerable smiled kindly, his gentle words clearly tinged with expectation.

"Indeed, Martial Nephew, how has your cultivation fared this past year?" The various Nascent Soul True Monarchs also had bright, expectant gazes. The stronger Yang Ji’s displayed comprehension and talent, the happier they were, for once Yang Ji entered the Dao Sect, they would all benefit.

"I have a sword; I invite Grandmaster and all Martial Uncles and Aunts to step outside and observe!" Yang Ji slowly stated.

"Oh, you wish to personally demonstrate your sword art? Very well, we shall accompany you outside." The White-Browed Venerable nodded, immediately enveloping Yang Ji and teleporting out of the main hall. The other Nascent Soul True Monarchs swiftly followed.

Outside the hall, by the cliff edge, Yang Ji stood holding his sword. Behind him, the high-ranking members of Canglan Sect watched with spiritual light flickering in their eyes, eager with anticipation. A light breeze stirred, rustling his robes. Yang Ji’s aura surged, the surrounding air began to churn, and the four sword dao runes in his mind started to vibrate.

Suddenly, he struck with his sword. Spiritual energy surged within him like a crashing tide. With one sword strike, the earth shattered, and the heavens quaked. Sword qi cleaved through the sky, stretching ten li. This strike was like wind tearing, like fire roaring, and even more so, like lightning striking swiftly and a marsh engulfing the heavens. With a single strike, wind swept, clouds scattered, and the world was startled. This sword was fast, incredibly fast, and its power was immense. Even after the sword qi passed, the sword intent lingered, leaving behind an endless sharpness.

"Is this a sword strike that fuses four sword intents?" The White-Browed Venerable, a Soul Transformation expert, couldn't help but narrow his pupils in shock upon seeing this strike. "And all four sword intents in this strike have reached ten percent mastery?"

"This?" Even Jian Yuanzi was greatly astonished by this scene. He had not expected that his disciple had not only comprehended the other three sword intents in this year but had also elevated them to such a level.

"A genius! Martial Nephew Yang is truly a genius! I thought mastering three additional nascent sword intents in a year would be the peak of his talent, but this is merely an insignificant beginning!" True Monarch Chang Ye swallowed hard, deeply shaken.

"Indeed, a genius! Not only has he comprehended the other three sword intents, but he has also perfectly fused them. To achieve this in such a short time, he is truly an astonishing genius!" True Monarch Guan Xiao's eyes gleamed with fervent light.

"Such comprehension, monstrous! Even if he can't compare to those natural Dao Bodies and Immortal Bodies close to the Dao, he should be able to rival Spirit Bodies and Sacred Bodies!" True Monarch Ling Gu said excitedly.

"The sect prospers, haha, the sect truly prospers!" True Monarch Yong En cheered, even more invigorated.

After his initial shock, the White-Browed Venerable was now beaming with smiles, his eyes squinted like those of a God of Longevity. He gazed at Yang Ji without end, until after a long moment, he slowly spoke, "From today onwards, Little Ji shall be the second Quasi-Void Refinement Seed after Chang Xiao. Do any of you have objections?"

"No objections, no objections!" The numerous Nascent Soul True Monarchs were all smiling, how could they possibly object?

"Little Ji, from now on, whatever you need, just ask. As long as the sect has it, you may take it. If the sect doesn't have it, we will do our best to acquire it for you." The White-Browed Venerable stroked his beard, his smile profound.

"Thank you, Grandmaster!" Yang Ji's face also showed a hint of a smile, seeing everyone's joy.

"Jian Yuan, from now on, you must promptly inform us of all of Little Ji's requests." The White-Browed Venerable looked at Jian Yuanzi.

"Rest assured, Venerable!" Jian Yuanzi nodded with a smile.

"Little Ji, here are two Spirit Cleansing Pills. Take them!" The White-Browed Venerable flicked his finger, sending two pills flying. Yang Ji raised his hand to receive them and bowed again. "Thank you, Grandmaster."

"This is what you've earned." The White-Browed Venerable’s face was full of benevolent smiles. He glanced at Yang Ji, then swept his gaze across everyone. "Very well, then let us adjourn this meeting. Let us not delay Little Ji's cultivation."

"Martial Nephew, please cultivate at ease. If you need anything, just tell us." The numerous Nascent Soul True Monarchs said eagerly.

"Thank you, Martial Uncles and Aunts!" Yang Ji bowed slightly, a faint smile on his face.

"Alright, alright, everyone disperse. Don't delay Little Ji's cultivation." The White-Browed Venerable said with a wave of his hand.

Everyone nodded and departed from the main hall.

The meeting concluded, and the Nascent Soul True Monarchs returned to their respective peaks. On Chang Dao Peak, True Monarch Chang Ye sat comfortably in his large chair as he had last time, leisurely sipping spirit tea, his mood appearing exceptionally cheerful.

The middle-aged man beside him leaned in again, asking curiously, "Father, you look radiant, your complexion is excellent. Was there good news at today's meeting?"

"After Chang Xiao, our Canglan Sect has produced another Quasi-Void Refinement Seed. Naturally, I am delighted!" True Monarch Chang Ye laughed heartily.

"A Quasi-Void Refinement Seed?" The middle-aged man was greatly startled, then his expression changed to one of immense joy. "Father, who is it?"

"See, it's that Martial Nephew Yang I told you about last time, whose comprehension talent is comparable to Chang Xiao's." True Monarch Chang Ye swept his hand, and spiritual light flashed in the air, revealing a scene with a figure within it.

"It's him? He actually became a Quasi-Void Refinement Seed? Is his talent that astounding?" The middle-aged man was greatly astonished, his eye twitching involuntarily, his heart filled with disbelief.

"What? Do you know Martial Nephew Yang?" True Monarch Chang Ye glanced at him.

"No, I don't! I don't!" The middle-aged man shook his head.

"You don't?" True Monarch Chang Ye frowned, then suddenly shouted, "You're lying!"
