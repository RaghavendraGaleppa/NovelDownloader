# Chapter 53: A Night Visit

As night fell, Lin Shan sat cross-legged in his room, immersed in cultivation. His earlier conversation with the Grand Elder and Immortal Huang had given him a general understanding of the loose cultivators in the capital and Yichuan Market. Now, he simply waited for tomorrow's meeting with the cultivators Immortal Huang had mentioned.

Immortal Huang had told him that before each journey, their small circle would hold an exchange gathering. Each cultivator would bring items they no longer needed to trade with others or sell for spirit stones. The purpose was to strengthen their combat abilities or financial resources before heading to Yichuan.

After all, during the journey to Yichuan, loose cultivators at the early and middle stages of Qi Refinement like them were easy targets for robbery.

Lin Shan's concern was twofold: he lacked spirit stones and had no spare treasures to trade. The only item he might offer was the Warm Sun Jade Pendant given by Lei Zhenzi, but as a low-grade refining material, he wasn't sure if anyone would want it.

As for the Purple Spirit Fruit core and the remnants of the Soulwood Fish, these were undoubtedly valuable items that should be sold to major buyers at a proper immortal market. What he urgently needed now were powerful spells, magical artifacts, or talismans. He had a growing premonition that the journey to Yichuan might not go smoothly.

...

Around midnight, a knock came at his door.

"Come in!"

The door creaked open to reveal the Grand Elder of Nightingale.

Lin Shan opened his eyes, ending his cultivation session. "To what do I owe the honor of your late-night visit, Grand Elder?"

Closing the door behind him, the Grand Elder sat opposite Lin Shan, raised his willow-like eyebrows, and pushed a three-foot-long brocade box toward him with a smile. "Immortal Lin, this old man has come to ask for your assistance."

Lin Shan didn't look inside the box. The Grand Elder wouldn't visit without reason, and whatever brought him here must be important. That he hadn't mentioned it during the day suggested he wanted to avoid Immortal Huang's notice.

"This isn't about inviting me to become a retainer, is it? I'm still young and wish to broaden my horizons at Yichuan Market. I'm afraid I must decline for now. Though if I find myself struggling there in the future, I may have to beg for your shelter then!"

Lin Shan left himself some room to maneuver, not closing any doors completely.

The Grand Elder chuckled, unbothered by being treated as a backup plan. He was certain Lin Shan would return eventually. Young people never came back until life had beaten them down—he'd seen it all before!

Without addressing that directly, the Grand Elder tapped the brocade box. "Let's set aside the matter of retainers for now. Rest assured, Nightingale's doors will always be open to you. Tonight, I come with a different request. You may open it and see."

Lin Shan complied, opening the box. The next moment, his face was awash with shifting colors.

Inside the three-foot box, multicolored spirit stones were neatly arranged, dazzling and resplendent, their glow illuminating the wooden room in the lamplight. A quick count revealed nearly fifty stones of various attributes.

"Haah—"

Lin Shan's breathing grew heavy. He'd never seen so many spirit stones in his life! Was Nightingale this wealthy?

After five breaths of rapid thought, Lin Shan forced himself to look away without touching the stones. "Might I ask what this is about first?"

The Grand Elder smiled. "Nothing too troublesome. I merely wish to ask Immortal Lin to purchase an item for me in Yichuan. If you can bring it back safely, the remaining spirit stones will be yours to keep."

"What item?"

"A Natural Vermilion Fruit!"

Lin Shan was surprised. Did the Grand Elder know about his previous acquisition?

The Grand Elder said meaningfully, "I know a Natural Vermilion Fruit appeared in Jingxiang not long ago, and I suspect it fell into your hands. If you're willing to part with it, these fifty spirit stones are yours."

"Unfortunately, I've already used it," Lin Shan shook his head.

Had he known the fruit could fetch fifty spirit stones, he might have hesitated before consuming it. But it seemed the Grand Elder knew of other sources.

"No matter," the Grand Elder nodded, as if he'd expected this. "Through decades of gathering information, I've learned that wild Vermilion Fruits are hidden in remote mountains and marshes, most difficult to find. However, some major immortal sects or cultivation families cultivate them in their spiritual fields.

"Some large shops in Yichuan have connections to these factions. The Hundred Treasures Pavilion, for instance, stocks Natural Vermilion Fruits. From what I've heard, such common spiritual items cost around thirty spirit stones, similar to low-grade magical artifacts.

"Alas, as a mortal, I cannot enter immortal markets. Hence, I must trouble Immortal Lin with this task."

Lin Shan listened thoughtfully, gaining some insight into basic prices in the cultivation world. But regarding the choice of proxy, he wondered why he'd been selected over others.

"Why not ask Immortal Huang? You've known him for over twenty years, while I'm a newcomer. Why place such trust in me?"

At the mention of Immortal Huang, the Grand Elder looked exasperated.

"Immortal Huang's cultivation is too low. Since returning twenty years ago, he's never left the capital. Now, with his lifespan nearing its end, he's taking this risky trip to Yichuan to settle affairs. Whether he'll even return is uncertain."

The implication was clear—Immortal Huang wasn't reliable.

The Grand Elder added with a shake of his head, "Immortal Huang fancies himself clever, which is precisely why he fell for that loan scam! Greed led to him being sold into slavery—how could I entrust this to him?"

Lin Shan understood now. Immortal Huang was indeed unreliable, and he wouldn't have trusted him either. At the same time, he began to worry—if Immortal Huang was this untrustworthy, what about his circle of cultivators? Would there be complications on their journey to Yichuan?

After further discussion, Lin Shan accepted the fifty spirit stones. It was an easy task with a twenty-stone profit—why refuse?

As for why the Grand Elder wanted the Vermilion Fruit, Lin Shan didn't ask. That was his business.

Before parting, Lin Shan asked the Grand Elder to use Nightingale's network to investigate whether any noble in the capital had acquired a giant black lotus Buddha statue from Zangke County in the southern borderlands over the past two years. The Grand Elder readily agreed, promising to inform him of any findings.

...

The next morning, Lin Shan went early to find Immortal Huang.

The old man emerged disheveled, arm around a maidservant, and only after much reluctance did he dress properly to leave Nightingale headquarters with Lin Shan.

The streets outside Bowang Marquis' residence bustled with activity. The morning market in the Great Song capital opened early, with citizens beginning their daily toil.

Along the way, Lin Shan curiously asked how a man nearing a hundred years still maintained his vigor. Immortal Huang evaded the question with vague replies.

Meanwhile, in a teahouse's top-floor private room in southern Bianliang, four people had been waiting.

A green-robed old man joked with the others, "That old Huang from Nightingale is finally coming out of hiding! What gave him the courage to return to Yichuan after being traumatized last time?"

A middle-aged woman in black Daoist robes covering her mouth laughed, "According to his message talisman, he's bringing a young mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator this time. That must be his safeguard."

"Hmph!" A hook-nosed man set down his teacup. "Old Huang has saved up over a hundred spirit stones in twenty years! With his low cultivation, isn't he afraid of being robbed on the road?"

The green-robed old man chuckled darkly, while the Daoist nun seemed thoughtful. The fourth person, wearing a bamboo hat, remained silent, simply listening to their conversation.

...

Half an hour later, Immortal Huang led Lin Shan into the teahouse.
