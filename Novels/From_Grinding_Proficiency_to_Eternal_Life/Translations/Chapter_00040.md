# Chapter 40: Astonishment

“Brother Qin, I’m fine. It should just be some superficial injuries,” Fei Yao said.

Hearing this, Qin Bo’s expression grew even more anxious. He quickly said, “Junior Sister, how about I take a look at your injuries, then go buy some medicine for you? We absolutely cannot be careless about this.”

Fei Yao felt a struggle in her heart upon hearing these words, a hint of embarrassment flashing across her face.

But in the end, she still nodded lightly, her voice as low as a mosquito’s hum.

“Hmm… we are wanderers of the jianghu; we don’t need to be too formal.”

Qin Bo’s heart secretly leaped with joy at these words.

Usually, although Fei Yao had a good impression of him, she always kept a certain distance, not giving him a chance to take things further.

He hadn’t expected that because of this incident, Fei Yao had actually relented.

For a moment, Qin Bo even felt an absurd desire to thank Xu Yunfan. If it hadn’t been for that kick, he might not have had this opportunity.

However, he didn’t show the slightest bit of this on the surface. He remained full of concern, his movements as gentle as if he were treating a rare treasure, truly appearing to be a man of deep affection.

When he carefully lifted Fei Yao’s clothes and saw the large patch of dark purple bruise on her lower abdomen, he feigned fury, his eyes widening as he stood up abruptly and roared, “You vile thief! Junior Sister, rest assured, a gentleman does not let an insult go unavenged. I will make him pay a painful price for that kick!”

Fei Yao was also recalling Xu Yunfan’s ruthless and brutal methods, her heart filled with anger and frustration. Seeing Qin Bo’s furious appearance before her, she felt an intense sweetness in her heart.

She bit her lower lip tightly, her eyes flashing with a domineering light, and said viciously, “Senior Brother, that guy has occupied your house and is so overbearing. We absolutely cannot let him off. We must find a way to kill him!”

“There is no need to rush. The other party is a martial artist who has at least completed the First Refinement. To deal with him, we cannot act recklessly. We must plan this carefully. If he is willing to sell the house, then everything is fine. We can go over again tomorrow.”

Qin Bo comforted her a few times and quickly pacified Fei Yao. Otherwise, if she insisted on going over again on a whim, the next time they saw the other party, it would likely be as a corpse.

A First Refinement martial artist hiding his name in a small city—without knowing his background or origins—if a conflict arose and the other party went for the kill, they wouldn’t even know who to avenge.

But conversely, the other party might also have no backing, or perhaps he is hiding from the light, which is why he is so low-key.

Perhaps, they could even gain some unexpected benefits from this guy.

Most importantly, the items inside that courtyard were likely found by Xu Yunfan. Whether the other party backed down or not, he had to find a way to kill him.

He had returned this time specifically for that item. The house was just an excuse. He would take the item and leave, but if it were discovered by that martial artist…

Qin Bo’s eyes flickered, murderous intent churning in his heart.

“Huh? Where are my silver notes?”

“…They might have fallen out when I was bringing you back. I’ll go buy the medicine first. Let’s rest for a day or two before making plans.”

“Ah, it’s fine. There’s still a bag of gold leaves in my bag. Senior Brother, just take them and use them. It’s enough for our expenses.”

A blush crept onto Fei Yao’s face. “Senior Brother, you’re so good to me.”

“…”

*You practiced the Flying Leg thoroughly once more. Your steps seem to have become a bit lighter, as if you have grasped its essence.*

*You pondered the Flying Leg carefully, reviewing the old to learn the new. You detected details you hadn’t noticed before and corrected your movements accordingly, finding your force application a bit more efficient.*

*…*

Looking at the information prompts popping up in his vision, almost flooding the screen, Xu Yunfan let out a breath and stopped his legs, which were already sore from practice. At this moment, the blood energy within him was churning and exceptionally active.

In the cold weather, he was bare-chested, pacing slowly in the courtyard to calm his blood energy. The heat radiating from his body and the moisture expelled made him steam all over, white vapor rising from him. His rolled-up trouser legs exposed his thighs, where one could see the bundles of muscles on his legs twitching continuously. The tangled blue veins pulsed as if they were about to burst, jumping incessantly with the contraction and expansion of his heart and the surging flow of blood.

Now, his legs were growing thicker day by day. The circumference of his thighs was such that there was almost no gap when he stood with his legs together.

Glancing at the proficiency of the Flying Leg, Xu Yunfan rubbed his hands together, feeling delighted. He hadn’t neglected the Flying Leg technique these past few days. After five days of intense training, he was only forty-some points away from reaching Great Completion.

It would take no more than a day or two.

Since reaching the First Refinement Great Completion, relying on the attribute panel, practicing other martial arts had become several times faster.

By the time he reached the Second Refinement Great Completion, with both skin and muscle refined, he could call himself a Second Refinement martial artist.

A Second Refinement martial artist was at least several levels stronger than a First Refinement martial artist. When their muscles snap, it sounds like a thunderclap. Their physical quality will take a leap forward, and muscle refinement especially enhances endurance.

Martial artists who have perfected muscle refinement are mostly known for their long endurance. After a high-intensity battle, a true expert might only be slightly out of breath, their face unflushed and their breathing steady.

Martial artists who have perfected skin refinement are better at cultivating strength. They can make their skin as tough as old cowhide. Although they cannot compare to martial artists who focus on external training, their strength can reach eight hundred to a thousand pounds, which is truly astonishing.

A Second Refinement martial artist like Xu Yunfan, with his extremely strong combat ability, would be a hot commodity anywhere. Naturally, he wanted to choose a good sect to settle down in.

He looked up into the distance. The setting sun was like blood, its dim afterglow gradually being swallowed by the darkness, while the moon on the other side was quietly rising.

Xu Yunfan happened to have reached the wall of the courtyard, looking at the opposite wall.

He exerted force with his feet, his toes gripping the ground. The muscles in his legs instantly tensed and bulged, like a powerful bow ready to be released.

As he gathered his strength, his muscles, like thick steel cables, snapped violently, emitting a low hum.

*Crack!*

The bluestone bricks beneath his feet shattered instantly under this tremendous force.

Xu Yunfan used this momentum to shoot out like an arrow released from a bow, his figure as swift as an arrow.

In the blink of an eye, he landed steadily on the ground below the opposite courtyard wall.

A distance of over ten meters was crossed in a single leap!

Xu Yunfan’s expression was somewhat strange. The force he had just exerted felt a bit empty, as if some of his strength hadn’t been fully utilized.

The bluestones laid here were a bit unstable.

He looked back toward the south, in the direction of the inn where Qin Bo and Fei Yao were staying.

The next morning, Xu Yunfan was once again drawn by the sound of knocking at his door. He slowly stopped the swinging of the long-handled wooden iron hammer in his hand.

He threw on a piece of clothing and went to open the door. When he saw who it was, Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow.

Standing before the door was Qin Bo, holding several gifts in his hand.

A smile appeared on Qin Bo’s face.

“Brother Xu, I have come this time specifically to apologize.”

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. He had never expected Qin Bo to adopt such a humble attitude.

As a disciple of the Jingtao Sect and a First Refinement Great Completion martial artist, it was truly not easy for him to make such a gesture. It even made Xu Yunfan hesitate in his desire to kill him, wondering if his own sense of insecurity was due to the series of encounters he had faced since coming to this world.
