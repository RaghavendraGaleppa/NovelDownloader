## Chapter 195: Prison Lock Sword

Though the spear-wielding Heavenly King possessed considerable strength, he lacked trump cards. Unlike that golden ape, who could casually pluck out a few strands of hair, each possessing the might of a Dao Master's strike, he could only overdraft his life force and unleash forbidden arts to barely reach the Dao Master level. It was simply not enough.

He had the self-awareness to know that what was coming next was not something he could participate in. He decided it would be best to find a secluded corner and wait for this place to reopen before leaving.

However, he suddenly froze, feeling a bone-chilling cold. He whipped his head around, his hair standing on end, his heart trembling violently. In the distance, a figure with wildly disheveled hair slowly walked towards him. Each step cracked the earth and mountains. Strands of black hair obscured the figure's face, yet they somehow blocked the vision of a Heavenly King.

"Roar!"

The disheveled figure let out a strange and chilling howl that made one's body turn cold; it was incredibly terrifying.

At that moment, he felt his body tremble, almost collapsing to the ground.

"Roar!"

Another roar echoed, its sound utterly dreadful. Howling winds surged, and thick mist enveloped him as the disheveled creature instantly closed in.

He collapsed to the ground, paralyzed. This was an unimaginable feat—a mere howl could strip a Heavenly King of his ability to resist.

Almost instantly, all the essence of blood and qi from the spear-wielding Heavenly King's body condensed into a single crimson-golden thread and flowed into the creature, leaving behind only a shriveled husk.

The spear-wielding Heavenly King's eyes were wide open. In his dying moments, he seemed to have witnessed the most incredible thing, filled with disbelief and boundless terror, for it was merely a sheet of human skin!

After nearly a day of travel, the trio, including Zhou Tian, had approached the enormous phantom Buddha image. It was daytime now, and the colossal Buddha sat cross-legged on the earth, its body reaching high into the clouds, hands pressed together in prayer, with a benevolent face and kind eyes. Numerous dharma seats floated around its body, each occupied by Bodhisattvas and Arhats.

In front of its body was a shimmering golden light, a true Buddha Kingdom. Through the golden light, faint human figures could be seen, and sounds of chanting seemed to emanate, as Buddhist disciples listened to sermons.

"Do you guys feel it? This phantom Buddha seems to be staring at us," Zhou Tian said, feeling an icy chill on the back of his neck, extremely cold.

"I feel it too," the Holy Devil replied. His cultivation was much higher than Zhou Tian's now, so the sensation was even more pronounced, like an ancient primordial mountain pressing down on him.

Huang Qi also nodded and said, "This place is eerie. That powerhouse must have surpassed the Heavenly Venerate realm. There might be some contingency plan left behind by him." His tone was respectful; he held no ill will just because Wutian had been their enemy in ancient times. This was the respect due to a pioneer on the Dao-seeking path.

"Then how do we get in?" Zhou Tian asked, inadvertently exchanging glances with the Holy Devil. The Holy Devil had obtained many incomplete pieces of information from a lotus seed, which had mentioned that this place was not yet ready to open.

"Entering through the Buddha Kingdom is basically impossible; it would take a very long time. We can enter through the Devil City. Once certain conditions are met, the Devil City will open," Huang Qi explained. He had clearly done his homework before coming, understanding a lot of hidden information.

"Alright, then we wait," Zhou Tian said indifferently. Waiting was fine.

Time passed quickly. After reaching a certain critical point, the Buddha instantly transformed into a Demon King, its face hideous, blood seeping from its body, inspiring fear.

The Sinister City floated and sank within the mist, exuding an ancient and desolate aura. Bathed in a bloody rain, it appeared even more grim. It was like a colossal fierce beast that had ripped through the void from ancient times, its malevolent aura piercing the soul.

Adding to the shock was the gigantic stone sword embedded in the city gate tower. It looked as if it had been violently smashed onto it, with massive cracks appearing on the ancient city walls around the stone sword, and the wall on the main gate itself had suffered severe damage.

As they drew closer, the feeling became even more profound.

"Prison Lock Sword…"

Seeing this sword, Huang Qi seemed lost in thought, muttering.

"You recognize this sword?" Zhou Tian noticed Huang Qi's strange behavior and asked.

"This sword was embedded here by a powerhouse from my Border Prison, so of course I recognize it." Huang Qi snapped out of his trance and produced a slender purple wooden box from thin air, adorned with various profound patterns.

He formed hand seals, and the purple wooden box glowed, emitting a clanging sword hum. Subsequently, the huge stone sword embedded in the city wall began to tremble, letting out a massive roar.

Large chunks of stone clattered down. Black patterns also appeared on the city wall, with a black substance flowing, an utterly malevolent material.

Rumbling!

The stone sword trembled, pulling itself out from the city wall. It emitted a dazzling golden light as its stone casing peeled off, then slowly shrunk. A golden longsword appeared, covered in cracks. After circling a few times in the void, it precisely dropped into the purple wooden box.

"Tsk, tsk, your Border Prison truly consists of sentimental people, doesn't it?" Zhou Tian deliberately emphasized the word "sentimental." A sword that could be embedded in this city certainly wouldn't be an ordinary item. There was a high probability it was a Heavenly Venerate artifact, yet Huang Qi had collected it so effortlessly.

"This sword is basically废弃, its divine essence has severely diminished. The cost to repair it would be no less than forging a new Heavenly Venerate artifact. It has no practical use anymore; it's just that the descendants of its owner wanted to take it back as a keepsake," Huang Qi explained as he put away the purple sword box.

Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow and looked at the Holy Devil, who gave a subtle nod. Having received a clear answer from the Holy Devil, Zhou Tian didn't press the matter further.

"What do we do next?" Zhou Tian asked. Huang Qi had said they could enter through the Devil City, and now the Devil City had appeared. What was the next step?

Huang Qi then pulled out a palm-sized black lotus from his spatial storage, emitting a faint dark light. It was similar to the lotus used by the Four Dragons of Tianyan to open this place, except theirs was golden, while Huang Qi's was black.

"Were the Four Dragons of Tianyan arranged by you?" the Holy Devil suddenly asked.

"No, they are people from the Supreme Academy, making them difficult to approach directly. However, our influence was indeed behind their acquisition of that golden lotus. We are under too much scrutiny to come here directly, so we could only act through others." As Huang Qi spoke, holding the lotus in his hand, he also produced a drop of pitch-black liquid. Just looking at it made Zhou Tian feel sick.

"What the hell is this stuff?" Zhou Tian looked away, still feeling waves of nausea.

"An extremely evil substance." Huang Qi did not elaborate, dropping the liquid onto the black lotus.

The black lotus, which had originally appeared jade-like, seemed to come alive. Its petals softened, swaying and blooming.

A humming sound filled the air, and the city gate trembled. Runes appeared on the gate, connecting together to form a pattern resembling a lotus flower.
