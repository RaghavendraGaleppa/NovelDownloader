# Chapter 6: Embodiment

At last, the unique eating contest came to an end with no clear winner between Han Yue and Fang Yi—primarily because they'd run out of meat. Both had completely devoured the mountains of meat before them.

Fang Yi grinned at Han Yue and said,  
"I knew I wasn't wrong about you! You also broke through to the Embodiment Realm using second-tier or higher origin energy!"  

He burst into hearty laughter.  

"Han Yue, you absolutely must stay with our Celestial Ninth Courtyard! Whatever requests you have, just name them—we'll do everything to fulfill them!"  

The entire Ninth Courtyard was overjoyed at Han Yue's arrival, their laughter echoing around him.  

Han Yue understood well that their goodwill stemmed from recognition of his strength and potential—an investment in him.  

Yet, being acknowledged felt good. He needed the shelter and guidance of such an organization to better integrate into this world. He responded warmly to everyone, further harmonizing the atmosphere.  

As the banquet concluded and the crowd dispersed, Fang Yi called out to Han Yue, who was about to retire to his quarters.  

"Xiao Liu! Over here!"  

A lean boy, no older than thirteen or fourteen, scurried over.  

"From now on, you'll stick with 'Han the Blade' and help him familiarize himself with Flesh-Division Market."  

"Yes, Courtyard Master!" Xiao Liu replied obediently.  

"Han Yue, don’t let Xiao Liu’s age fool you—he was born in Flesh-Division Market and knows every corner of it. Any questions you have, just send him to handle them."  

Fang Yi added proudly, "What’s more, Xiao Liu has resisted absorbing first-tier origin energy to this day. He’s aiming to seize second-tier energy during the New Year’s trials. I’d say the boy has great potential! Feel free to mentor him too."  

Han Yue nodded in agreement and took Xiao Liu back to his room.  

Along the way, Xiao Liu chattered nonstop, providing Han Yue with plenty of useful information.  

Flesh-Division Market had 396 numbered courtyards, each with wildly different structures—ranging from sects and clans to merchant houses, mercenary groups, brothels, and even Taoist temples. Membership varied just as drastically, from thousands in the largest courtyards to mere handfuls in the smallest.  

Under the market’s rules, larger courtyards weren’t necessarily stronger, but those with only a few members were undoubtedly formidable.  

The strongest in each courtyard held the title of Courtyard Master—Fang Yi, in Celestial Ninth Courtyard’s case.  

Back in Han Yue’s quarters, Xiao Liu made himself at home, brewing tea and serving it to him.  

As they drank, Han Yue asked, "Xiao Liu, when do you plan to break through to the Embodiment Realm? And tell me what you know about cultivation."  

"Of course, Brother Blade!" Xiao Liu’s excitement was palpable—he had long yearned for this realm.  

"The Embodiment Realm, also called the Foundation Realm, is both the starting point and the most crucial foundation of cultivation. A cultivator enters it by absorbing and retaining external origin energy within their body."  

"In Flesh-Division Market, advancing is simple. The daily Flesh-Division Ceremony provides free first-tier demon beast meat. Consuming it and successfully integrating its energy allows one to ascend."  

"They say our market has 100,000 Embodiment Realm cultivators—most of whom relied on first-tier beast energy. But that path locks one’s potential, making progress agonizingly slow."  

"The Embodiment Realm has two stages: Energy Absorption and Foundation Establishment. The difference lies in the quality of one’s origin energy."  

"To advance from Absorption to Foundation Establishment, one must refine their energy to at least second-tier. But those who started with first-tier energy face immense difficulty, requiring years of grueling effort."  

"Hence, while we have 100,000 cultivators, far fewer reach the Foundation Establishment stage. Courtyards with second-tier cultivators number less than a fifth of the total!"  

"To achieve anything in cultivation, one must absorb at least second-tier energy from the start—doing so allows an instant leap to Foundation Establishment, saving tremendous time."  

"In our Ninth Courtyard, only the Courtyard Master and you, Brother Blade, achieved this. The rest must painstakingly refine their energy to second-tier just to catch up to your starting point—the gap is immense!"  

Han Yue finally grasped the basics.  

"So, Xiao Liu, you’re aiming to absorb second-tier energy directly?"  

"Yes, Brother Blade. I never partake in the daily ceremonies or eat our courtyard’s meat. I only consume second-tier beast meat during the New Year trials!"  

"Sadly, I’ve attempted absorption three years in a row without finding compatible energy. The Courtyard Master says this year is my last chance. If I fail again, I’ll settle for first-tier."  

Through their conversation, Han Yue learned more.  

Xiao Liu’s father had been Han Yue’s predecessor as the courtyard’s butcher—a powerful cultivator who’d reached Foundation Establishment and dedicated his life to the Ninth Courtyard.  

Thanks to his father’s status, Xiao Liu grew up here and was groomed to absorb second-tier energy.  

But a year ago, his father perished during a hunt—a devastating loss for the courtyard and a turning point for Xiao Liu.  

By the market’s rules, as a mortal, Xiao Liu should have been expelled. Only Fang Yi’s mercy, honoring his father’s contributions, allowed him to stay.  

Yet Xiao Liu knew mortals had no place here. He had to ascend soon. This New Year would be his final attempt at second-tier energy. Failure would mean abandoning his father’s hopes and settling for first-tier.  

Their talk lasted until the moon hung high. After arranging to explore the market together the next day, Xiao Liu left.  

Alone, Han Yue sat cross-legged on his bed, calming his mind for meditation.  

He channeled the thunderous power of [Thoughtless Slash], circulating it through his meridians to temper his muscles, bones, organs, and skin—forging himself anew.
