# Chapter 65: The Value of His Talent Continues to Grow; The Punishment for the Loser is Revealed

Ying Bing, though perplexed, still answered the questions on the paper, starting from the simple and moving to the profound.

"Sword skills and sword techniques are essentially the same thing. They are about precision, flexibility, and making them your own. If you practice a superior sword art to the pinnacle of mastery, you fall into this category, which is considered passable. However, for those who truly possess Sword Qi, Sword Momentum, Sword Intent, and the Sword Dao, sword skills are ultimately just some experiences they've summarized on their path to the Sword Dao."

Li Mo half-understood. He could only apply his understanding of mathematics and physics from his previous life. If the Sword Dao was like mathematics, then sword skills and techniques were formulas. For most people, solving a problem meant applying a formula. Where did the formulas come from? They were summarized by the true geniuses who reached the source.

Li Mo nodded, taking out paper and pen.

"Are you...?"

"Yes, I'm taking notes." Li Mo smiled, scribbling rapidly. The concepts were simple now; he feared he wouldn't remember them once they became more profound.

Ying Bing felt a slight sense of confusion. In all her discussions on the Dao, across both her past and present lives, it was the first time someone had taken notes while discussing. After all, these weren't things to be memorized; those who understood would grasp them instantly.

After a moment, she spoke again: "Sword Qi, Sword Momentum, Sword Intent are indeed three different paths, yet they all lead to the same destination. First, let's talk about Sword Qi. In the Great Shang Dynasty, before the Great Yu, there was a great scholar who studied for sixty years. He didn't practice martial arts or swordplay; he only wrote poetry and classics. Sixty years later, upon entering the Golden Luan Hall, he used 'lips like spears and tongues like swords' to criticize the Emperor and cut down the Great Shang's national destiny. This is the embodiment of a scholar's righteous indignation transforming into Sword Qi. As for Sword Momentum, it emphasizes following the flow of power. The rising and setting of the sun is the momentum of heaven and earth; the blossoming and wilting of flowers is the momentum of nature; the will of the people is human momentum..."

Ying Bing gently poured herself a cup of tea to moisten her throat. Her demeanor reminded Li Mo of a young, beautiful teacher from his previous life. Usually taciturn, but once she started teaching, she exuded a confident, almost sacred aura of mastery over truth.

Of course. Li Mo wasn't just listening intently; his hand kept writing. Half an hour later, seven or eight sheets of paper, their ink still wet, were spread out on the table. Student Li contentedly licked the tip of his pen. As long as he memorized all of this, he would become terrifyingly strong! He would definitely crush that little Princess Jiang! Just as Li Mo was feeling supremely confident, Ying Bing's questioning voice came: "Do you understand everything I've said just now?" As a genius who could ask such questions, she assumed he would have grasped most of it by now.

"Understood!" Li Mo nodded confidently.

"Then tell me your own insights." Ying Bing's eyes, like wind and snow, looked directly into Li Mo's, a posture of calmly awaiting good news.

"Abba abba..." Li Mo's expression froze, his smile gradually vanished, and he fell into contemplation.

Had he perhaps... gotten a little carried away just now? Why hadn't he thought that this 'Ice Block' would also test him? Oh, right, it was a discussion. The Ice Block had talked for so long; he couldn't possibly say nothing. But honestly, he was truly bewildered. Practicing hammers and practicing swords were vastly different... After all, had anyone ever heard of a blacksmith forging iron for sixty years, then going to court and hammering a tyrannical emperor to death with a single blow?

Noticing a hint of doubt gradually appearing in the Ice Block's eyes, Student Li's CPU whirred rapidly. Ying Bing truly didn't understand. She had only asked him to share his insights; it shouldn't be that difficult, should it? Or was it that...

At this moment, the contemplative Li Mo finally spoke, apologizing with a smile: "Sorry, I was thinking a bit too deeply just now. In my opinion, Ying Bing, you don't need to make it so complicated. What is known as 'the sword' has only three realms. One, limited to technique: a sword in hand, but no sword in heart. A common man's rage, blood splattered five paces away. The second kind: no sword in hand, but the sword held within the heart. One practices the unity of man and sword, capable of using all things as a sword. The third kind: no sword in hand, and no sword in heart. At that point, your very existence *is* the Sword Dao."

His calm tone fell. The eloquently speaking youth seemed utterly unconcerned with others' evaluations, merely expressing his own understanding of the Sword Dao. The jade-like beauty across from him, sipping tea, her expression seemed like melting ice and snow, revealing a hint of emotion.

After a long pause, her lips parted slightly: "Excellent."

"You taught me well."

"No, you are correct. The Great Dao is simple; reducing complexity to simplicity is the true principle."

"Oh, not at all." Li Mo chuckled lightly on the surface, but inwardly, he wiped away a bead of sweat. Fortunately, he used to secretly read novels in class, even getting caught by his teacher who said he wouldn't amount to anything doing that. Look, it's coming in handy now!

However, seeing the 'Ice Block' moved and sensing an inclination for her to ask another question, Student Li quickly preempted her: "If one only practices sword skills, can they still reach the Sword Dao?"

Hearing this, Ying Bing pondered, and only after much thought did she nod: "Yes, yet also no."

"Yes?" Li Mo thought to himself, *the Ice Block doesn't seem like a riddle-teller.*

"'Skill approaches Dao' (技近乎道), this is indeed theoretically possible. But there are countless sword arts in the world. An ordinary person, even if they spend their entire life, would only learn a mere scoop from an ocean. They would die of old age before achieving it, so no one can do it, unless... never mind, don't think too much about this aspect, it's meaningless." What Ying Bing had almost said was that only the legendary 'Immortals,' who could live as long as heaven and earth, would have enough time to achieve 'Skill approaches Dao.' But the existence of Immortals itself was even more elusive and unpredictable than the concept of skill approaching Dao.

"I see." Li Mo took a deep breath, suppressing the strange feeling in his heart.

"It's getting late. Thank you for resolving my doubts today."

"I'll go rest first." With that, Li Mo gracefully stood up and left, not taking a single cloud with him. He didn't even mention washing the dishes after eating.

Li Mo's figure departed. In the teacup before the young woman, a leaf drifted down, rippling the tea surface that reflected her jade-like countenance.

The more time she spent with him, the more she felt he was significantly different from his previous life. From being utterly unremarkable at first, he was now impossible to ignore. Today, Li Mo had drawn much closer to her world, almost with one foot already stepping inside. Of course. Her strongest aspect wasn't the Sword Dao. But relying on this sword Dao talent, he was already able to stand by her side.

"Compared to Jiang Chulong..." As the thought arose, Ying Bing silently shook her head. Jiang Chulong was born with a sword fetus and once possessed a sword bone; they weren't on the same starting line, so they couldn't be compared.

(System Notification: One month is approaching. The system will announce the comparison results in seven days. At that time, the system will rank all gifted martial artists in the Eastern Desolation Region. The punishment for the loser has been determined. Punishment Condition: "Share a bed with the person who surpassed you for at least one month.")

Ying Bing didn't even look at the so-called punishment. She was already at the twentieth pulse of the Blood Qi Realm. In seven days, she would fully complete the grand circulation of Blood Qi and enter the Internal Breath Realm! Achieving Internal Breath within a month, with all twenty-four pulses opened—this was unprecedented throughout the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands! In the Internal Breath Realm, possessing the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix's Ethereal Soul, she could wield the power of the Great Yin, and also had the vision and martial accumulation of a Nine Heavens being. Among her peers, she couldn't imagine anyone who could surpass her.
