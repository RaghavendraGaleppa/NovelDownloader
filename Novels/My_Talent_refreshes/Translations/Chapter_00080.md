**Chapter 80: Azure Spirit Fruit and Talisman Sales Income**

The spirit farmer, upon hearing Chu Ning's words, showed a hint of hesitation on his face. "These Azure Spirit Fruit seeds were obtained by me inadvertently. I know these Azure Spirit Fruits are not easy to cultivate; even catalyzing their growth is difficult for me. However, the income from spirit rice is too low, so I wanted to give it a try."

Chu Ning heard this and couldn't help but secretly shake his head. This cultivator, appearing to be at Qi Condensation third-layer, was already struggling with planting spirit rice. The Azure Spirit Fruit required more advanced spells for daily care, and he didn't believe the other party could cultivate it successfully. After all, if this Azure Spirit Fruit were to be cultivated within the sect, it would require at least a high-grade spirit field in Zone C.

Thinking of this, Chu Ning's heart stirred, and he said to the other party, "Fellow Daoist, how about we make a trade? You give me these Azure Spirit Fruit seeds, and I'll give you some Purple Yam Fruit seeds in return, plus one spirit stone. I'll also give you an Evergreen Talisman. What do you think?"

The middle-aged spirit farmer's face immediately lit up with surprise as he looked at Chu Ning, asking with a hint of disbelief in his tone, "Is what the shopkeeper said true?" Without another word, he immediately put down the spirit rice he had just picked up and the Azure Spirit Fruit in his other hand. He then quickly grabbed the items Chu Ning had taken out, as if fearing Chu Ning would go back on his word. Chu Ning nodded, said no more, and took out a small handful of Purple Yam Fruit seeds from his storage pouch. Seeing this, Chu Ning smiled and accepted both the spirit rice and the Azure Spirit Fruit seeds. Chu Ning hadn't brought any spirit plants to sell; today was mainly for acquisition.

Chu Ning didn't profit much from this deal; in terms of value, the items he gave were slightly higher. The reason he wanted the Azure Spirit Fruit seeds was purely because they perfectly fit his plans for the back courtyard. He took the Azure Spirit Fruit seeds to the backyard.

Chu Ning replicated the process, continuously catalyzing the Azure Spirit Fruit. With three consecutive instant-cast Catalyst Spells, the Azure Spirit Fruit began to sprout. Immediately after, Chu Ning followed up with the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom spell, and the vines began to grow a little. Without instant-cast Catalyst Spells, it would be difficult to make them sprout and grow. The truly difficult part in its early stages is actually catalyzing its growth.

After planting Azure Spirit Fruits around the outer edges of both back courtyards, Chu Ning turned his attention to the courtyard on the Spirit Plant Shop side. This courtyard was mainly for planting spirit plants that couldn't be directly stored in the storage pouch after acquisition. Chu Ning already had a plan in mind. Moreover, although the Thorn Bind spell is a low-grade beginner spell, its damage after binding is highly related to the strength of the spirit plant itself. These Azure Spirit Fruits grow on vines, making them very suitable for casting Thorn Bind spells, even better than Iron Thread Vines. The growth period of the Azure Spirit Fruit is longer than Iron Thread Vines, but this refers to the time it takes to flower and bear fruit. The time it takes for the vines to grow is not longer than Iron Thread Vines. At the same time, the Azure Spirit Fruit absorbs spiritual energy better than even Ink Spirit Bamboo or Purple Crystal Bamboo. If valued in spirit stones, Azure Spirit Fruits are roughly twice as expensive as Purple Yam Fruits. However, because Azure Spirit Fruits are more difficult to cultivate and take longer, a regular cultivator can plant two seasons of Purple Yam Fruits in the time it takes to grow one season of Azure Spirit Fruits. So, in terms of total yield, the difference between the two is not significant. The Azure Spirit Fruit is currently suitable for cultivation, but Chu Ning felt that as his cultivation advanced, the rate at which Azure Spirit Fruits absorb spiritual energy might not be sufficient for him later on. It is also very suitable for assisting in the cultivation of the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art with the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom spell. Based on these two reasons, Chu Ning chose to trade for these Azure Spirit Fruits. And for Chu Ning, there wasn't much difference in the difficulty of cultivating either. He mused, "If there's a chance, I should get more high-quality spirit plants." Even if these spirit plants couldn't be sold in the end, they could be used to offset the sect's share of the harvest. "Calculated, that's about fifty percent of the harvest."

As for the courtyard on the Talisman Pavilion side, Chu Ning planned to plant some spirit plants that absorb spiritual energy more quickly. This was naturally to facilitate cultivation using the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom spell. These two courtyards could also be used to plant other things.

The middle-aged spirit farmer had arrived near closing time for the market; after he left, there were hardly any people left on the bustling market street. After confirming the market had finally closed, Chu Ning shut his shop. Chu Ning used the Blade Edge spell to dig an opening in the connected wall, allowing passage.

Having completed these tasks, Chu Ning began to tally the day's earnings from both shops. Chu Ning first checked the Spirit Plant Shop's side. He had acquired Spirit Rice, Red Spirit Rice, Tranquility Grass, White Butterfly Flowers, Apricot Spirit Fruits... Most were common spirit plants from the vicinity. Chu Ning roughly sorted them and put them into designated storage pouches. The large storage pouch He Changyou had specially given him came in handy at this time.

Putting away this storage pouch, Chu Ning took out his own small storage pouch and examined the talismans. Only then did he nod in satisfaction. These spirit stones were now in hand; this was the real deal. And when Chu Ning counted the number of spirit stones again, he was truly startled. In just this one day, he had actually sold 837 spirit stones worth of goods. Chu Ning murmured to himself, "If the income is like this every day..."

Of the originally 220 Blazing Fire Talismans and Profound Ice Talismans, 117 and 138 remained respectively, meaning 103 and 82 were sold. Only 105 Earth Armor Talismans remained, meaning 95 were sold. Of the 260 Wood Escape Talismans, 200 remained, meaning 60 were sold. Of the Rejuvenation Talismans used for healing, 155 remained, meaning 45 were sold. Of the Evergreen Talismans, 110 remained, meaning 40 were sold.

Most were sold as part of the "buy five, get one free" promotion, but some were sold individually. Firstly, this was naturally attributed to his "buy five, get one free" promotion. Secondly, his talismans were of higher quality than those from Wind Canyon, which aroused much curiosity. In this cultivation world that completely lacked marketing knowledge, simply implementing some modern promotional strategies was enough to create significant buzz.

But correspondingly, this also overdrawn everyone's purchasing power. It was impossible for this many people to need to buy talismans every market day. Today was clearly an exception. This meant that most talisman masters could not achieve the same production intensity as Chu Ning. The talismans Chu Ning sold today represented between a quarter and a third of his entire month's production from before. Moreover, even an ordinary late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator couldn't cultivate their divine sense like him and use it to craft talismans. Chu Ning naturally understood that not everyone could be like him. It would be impressive if they could produce even one-third of Chu Ning's talisman quantity, and their quality wouldn't be as high. After all, other people's success rate in crafting talismans couldn't be this high. Comparing the two, a normal mid-stage or even late-stage Qi Condensation disciple, in the same amount of time, would produce far less. Chu Ning stroked his chin. This matter was entirely up to fate; it wasn't something he could do just by wanting to.

However, upon second thought, Chu Ning shook his head. "No wonder the sect's rule stipulated that the talisman shop had to turn over 500 spirit stones to the sect each month. The sect certainly calculates everything accurately."

Having tallied the talismans he sold today, Chu Ning now began to seriously consider Luo Yiping's words. Wind Canyon was preparing to put out a good number of beginner-grade mid-tier talismans for sale. It seemed it was time to learn the talisman crafting techniques recorded in the Spirit Talisman Grimoire.
