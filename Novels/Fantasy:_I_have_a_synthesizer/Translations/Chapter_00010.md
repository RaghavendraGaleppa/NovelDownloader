# Chapter 10: Su Yu's Strength, Instant Kill!

"Su Yu, never thought this, did you?" Li Long stared at Su Yu with a twisted expression.

At this moment, Liu Yiyi walked to Li Long's side, leaning against his shoulder, and a soft, sweet voice rang out. "Brother Long, I helped you get Su Yu out, didn't I? You have to compensate me well!" Liu Yiyi blushed, looking adorable.

Li Long squeezed Liu Yiyi's soft, fragrant shoulder roughly and chuckled. "Don't worry, tonight, I'll make sure you have a good time!"

After saying that, Li Long continued to look at Su Yu. "Do you really think that just because you became a martial artist, everything's fine? In Heng City, offending my Li family means a dead end, even if you're a martial artist!"

Su Yu's eyebrow twitched slightly, then he put on a fearful expression. "You... what are you doing? Assassinating a martial artist, if the Martial Artist Association finds out, even your Li family might not be able to withstand their wrath, right?"

"Hahahaha!" Hearing Su Yu's words, Li Long burst into wild laughter. "Naïve! Su Yu, don't forget, this is outside the city! Of course, I wouldn't dare to act against you within the city, but out here, without anyone from the Martial Artist Association, do you think if you die, they'll pin it on us? And besides," Li Long sneered, "For a mere Su Yu to warrant such elaborate planning, even in death, you should feel proud!"

However, just as Li Long looked at Su Yu's location, his pupils instantly contracted. "What?!"

He saw that in the desolate wilderness, Su Yu, dressed in white, stood silently in place, his gaze utterly calm. Facing the ambush of three Blood Qi Realm martial artists, Su Yu merely raised his arms gently. His arms subtly undulated, like rippling water. In an instant, vast Blood Qi surged through Su Yu's arms.

The next moment, Su Yu unleashed a punch. It carried circles of Blood Qi that resembled ripples. Before one of the Blood Qi Realm martial artists could react, his chest was instantly pierced through. He didn't even realize he was dead.

The remaining two martial artists were shocked. One of them roared, "This guy's tough! Don't hold back, everyone attack!"

Su Yu sneered. "What if it's the Blood Refinement Realm? Murdering a martial artist is a grave crime to begin with. I'd like to see if your Blood Refinement Realm father can withstand the Martial Artist Association's fury!"

Su Yu's body moved violently, like an afterimage, instantly appearing before Li Long and Liu Yiyi. With a swing of his fist, he completely slaughtered both of them.

Afterwards, Su Yu thoroughly stripped the five bodies of their valuables, then casually started a fire and incinerated all five corpses. Only then did he look towards Heng City.

"Li Group," Su Yu murmured, killing intent erupting in his eyes.

Meanwhile, in Heng City. At the very top of the Li Group's building, Li Tianhe sat quietly on a sofa, eyes closed, resting.
