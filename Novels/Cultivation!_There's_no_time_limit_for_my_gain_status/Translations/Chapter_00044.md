# Chapter 44: Piranhas

Sensing the current state of his Black Zombie, Jiang Li floated on the water's surface for a moment before gritting his teeth and finally making up his mind—he dispelled the Wooden Armor Technique.

Without the buoyancy provided by the wooden armor, Jiang Li's body quickly sank back into the churning river.

Once again, he was tossed and turned by the turbulent currents. His body instinctively stiffened as he struggled against the relentless flow of water.

*Stay calm! Stay calm!*

*Relax! Relax!*

Jiang Li forced himself to endure the weightless sensation in the water, consciously relaxing every muscle he could.

Like a video game character whose controller had been set aside, he detached himself from his physical sensations and observed his body's movements as if from a third-person perspective.

At first, the violent spinning didn't slow down—it actually intensified.

In the murky water, a dark shadow loomed larger ahead—another submerged rock!

*Spiritual Armament! Mountain Collision Technique!*

The impending collision triggered his instinct to defend himself.

But... even without defense, hitting it once probably wouldn't kill him... Should he... try it?

*Try it!*

Jiang Li deactivated his hardened armor and relaxed the muscles that had bulged from the Mountain Collision Technique.

He let himself be carried by the current, spiraling headfirst toward the rock.

*Splash—*

To say he wasn't nervous would be a lie. But contrary to his expectations of a skull-shattering impact, it never came.

With a swirl of rushing water, Jiang Li's body—now as flexible as if boneless—twisted along with the suddenly shifting current, narrowly avoiding the jagged rock.

*It worked! It actually worked!*

Underwater, Jiang Li was overjoyed, exhaling a stream of bubbles in excitement.

*This method really works!*

This small success boosted his confidence, and his body naturally relaxed further as he let the rapid current carry him onward.

...

Much later, the first light of dawn broke through the water's surface, casting fragmented rays onto Jiang Li's face.

*Gurgle—*

A few bubbles escaped his nose as he withdrew from his Ghost Wood Technique meditation. Sensing that the surrounding currents had grown calmer, he realized—he must have reached a gentler stretch of the river.

But then, he felt slight tugs and stings on his skin and hair.

Opening his eyes, he saw a school of small, axe-shaped fish—each about the size of a palm—nibbling at him.

He raised a hand and cast Appraisal.

Unlike when used on humans, Appraisal worked much more effectively on these weak, low-level creatures.

**[Name: Serrated Piranha]**  
**[Type: Aquatic Swarm]**  
**[Age: Sexually Mature]**  
**[Gender: Female]**  
**[Diet: Carnivorous]**  
**[Behavior: Pack Hunters]**  

So... he was being targeted by a swarm of piranhas.

Jiang Li shook his head and hands, trying to dislodge the piranhas clinging to him.

But unlike herbivorous fish that would flee at sudden movements, these piranhas weren't scared of humans at all. Instead, they interpreted Jiang Li's actions as the last struggles of prey and grew even more frenzied.

Their jagged teeth clamped onto his skin and hair as they writhed violently.

*Seriously? Me, Jiang Li, a proper cultivator—afraid of a few little fish?*

He grabbed one piranha and yanked it off his body.

Its serrated teeth failed to pierce his skin, instead getting ripped right out of its mouth as he pulled it free.

"Trying to eat me? Your teeth aren't sharp enough for that."

With a squeeze of his hand, the still-thrashing piranha was crushed into a bloody pulp.

Just as he was about to deal with the others in the same way, he noticed something odd.

The water... was vibrating?

Liquids transmitted vibrations far better than air, and soon, the tremors grew unmistakable.

Not far from him, a dense black mass was rapidly approaching.

Wait—**[Behavior: Pack Hunters]**—Jiang Li suddenly felt a chill run from his scalp all the way down to his heels. *This is bad!*

The scent of blood had clearly attracted an entire swarm of piranhas. Jiang Li was now in a situation far worse than kicking a hornet's nest.

He tried to swim away, but he was no merman—there was no way he could outswim fish.

The water darkened as the swarm enveloped him, countless ravenous piranhas darting about so frantically that the river seemed to boil.

*Buzz—*

Tens of thousands of piranhas surged toward him. Then, remembering something, Jiang Li reached into his robe, pulled out a handful of pitch-black ruined pills, and crushed them into the water.

A cloud of inky darkness spread through the already murky river. Within moments, the piranhas clinging to him went limp, their jaws slackening as they sank toward the riverbed.

The approaching swarm screeched to a halt, repulsed by the stench of the ruined pills. They circled the contaminated area, unwilling to cross the invisible boundary.

*Holy hell, that scared me to death!*

*Ruined pills—what a godsend!*

Jiang Li was deeply moved. These ruined pills, churned out by the pill refinery by the basketful every day, were considered hazardous waste—buried at least twenty meters underground to avoid contaminating the soil and spiritual herbs.

Their pungent odor and dark color made them utterly useless, not even fit to serve as poison. Yet for Jiang Li, they had proven invaluable time and again.

*Truly, I'm a genius!*

Just as he was mentally patting himself on the back, something yellow flashed in the corner of his vision—something falling from the water's surface.

With his sharp eyes and experience, he recognized it instantly—a talisman.

*Boom!*

A muffled explosion erupted from the talisman, displacing the water and creating a temporary vacuum. A spherical shockwave blasted outward.

Wherever the shockwave passed, swathes of fish were instantly stunned, floating belly-up toward the surface.

Jiang Li, being slightly farther away, still felt his mind go blank for a split second from the impact—he nearly blacked out.

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*

More talismans rained into the water, setting off a chain of explosions that left the once-ferocious piranha swarm dazed and disoriented.

Realizing the danger, Jiang Li tore off a piece of buoyant wood he had been using for balance and whipped out the iron chain coiled around his waist.

With a powerful throw, the heavy chain shot downward, wrapping around a submerged rock.

Jiang Li yanked it taut, the metal links clinking as they straightened.

The force pulled him swiftly downward, away from the explosions.

His feet finally touched the muddy riverbed. Though movement was still difficult, the solid ground beneath him brought some relief.

Grabbing a large rock, Jiang Li oriented himself with the current and began trudging forward, step by laborious step.
