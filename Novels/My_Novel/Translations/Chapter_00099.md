Chapter 99: The Intimidation Works, Regarding the Madam

Li Xian fished out the martial art manual "Tiger Gate Claw."

During the recent battle, Lu Xuefeng had displayed several martial arts. The "Extreme Iron Palm" and "Hard Qi Technique" were similar to those of Peng Fox.

Only the Tiger Gate Claw was kept as his trump card. He had hidden his true strength for a long time, only using it when he had no other choice.

"Martial arts manuals are so precious. This one is probably worth hundreds of taels of silver. Even for bandits, it would take a very long time to save up that kind of money."

Li Xian knew how difficult it was to obtain martial arts manuals.

Masters passed them to disciples, and disciples passed them to grand-disciples. It was a hierarchical process, mostly relying on verbal transmission. Knowledge was given bit by bit, like squeezing toothpaste. Sometimes, to make disciples serve them sincerely and with filial piety, masters would even deliberately create difficulties to cause their disciples to go astray in their training.

This was done so the disciples would seek guidance.

Then, the master would display their skill to completely subdue them.

Such deeds were common in the manor. Although Pang Long did not teach martial arts, there were over a hundred guards divided into four ranks: A, B, C, and D. Many of them shared the same martial arts.

Even if there were copies of the manuals, allowing them to practice from the books, it was enough to get started. However, to achieve deeper proficiency faster, one needed a master to solve their doubts.

It was a small江湖 (Jianghu, martial world) in itself.

"That Ma Daozi must have passed on his martial arts verbally. But this Tiger Gate Claw didn't come from Ma Daozi. It was something Lu Xuefeng obtained privately."

"Lu Xuefeng had great talent and was gradually showing a 'Tiger and Leopard Physique,' marking him as an extraordinary person. He secretly practiced martial arts on his own."

"They may have sworn brotherhood, but... whether there is any true affection is unknown. Instead, there is likely a lot of vigilance, suspicion, and jealousy."

Li Xian sat on the roof, stroking his chin with a frown.

This conclusion was based on common sense. Since transmigrating here, everyone he had seen was only interested in profit.

As for those with true feelings...

Pang Long could barely be counted as half. But all his passion was given to the Madam, with a loyalty so true it could be seen by heaven and earth. Yet, the Madam ignored him.

"If they have no real affection, Ma Daozi, as the big brother, should be somewhat wary of the Fifth Master."

"I have killed the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Masters. First, I eliminated what he feared, and second, I have already revealed my strength."

"With solid strength, I can now wave the Madam's banner, making Ma Daozi hesitate..."

"Making him feel it's not easy to kill me, he should think it over again."

Li Xian's eyes shone brightly.

Whether they had affection or not, Ma Daozi surely hated him. But at this level, adding another worry for Ma Daozi could only be beneficial.

He immediately returned to his room to get paper and a pen.

He wrote:

"Shan Feng Stronghold, received."

While thinking, he wrote:

"I have long heard that the Shan Feng Stronghold acts tyrannically, plundering villagers. It has troubled my Black River Village for years, cutting off its water source and plundering countless grains."

"Today, I have executed three of you as a warning."

"If you犯 again, I will climb the mountains and exterminate your nest."

Li Xian imitated the Madam's tone.

After considering the signature for a moment, he wrote the four characters: [The Sword-Breaking Madam].

Ma Daozi might not have heard of the Madam's title.

"It's unknown if this plan will work. I need to set up a trap in advance, just in case."

Li Xian prepared his bow and arrows and went to the Shan Feng Stronghold.

He saw the stronghold was already empty. The remaining bandits, after Lu Xuefeng's rampage, were either dead or had fled.

It seemed the stronghold was severely damaged, but as long as Ma Daozi was not dead, he would return to personally take command. The small fry would naturally gather back again.

He placed the letter in the most conspicuous spot.

Li Xian turned and left.

One day later.

At the mountain pass, a black cauldron was boiling fiercely. A pot of fine soup was about to be finished.

"Boss, we're almost out of charcoal. After this batch, we'll have to buy more," said the second master of the Shan Feng Stronghold, Hong Kai. He guarded a box of "smokeless charcoal" and shook his head as he saw the supply running low.

He thought of his early life, having no firewood or rice, worrying about charcoal. After becoming a bandit and practicing martial arts, he still...

Still worried about charcoal.

"Out of charcoal again?"

Ma Daozi frowned. "This smokeless charcoal doesn't have enough火力 (firepower). We've burned over a hundred pounds, and the fine food still isn't cooked."

"Boss, should we switch to a different type of charcoal for the next batch?" Hong Kai asked.

"Switch charcoal?" Ma Daozi cursed. "How can it be that easy? Our stronghold's plundered income for a whole year is barely enough to buy a hundred pounds of smokeless charcoal."

"That's just enough for one cauldron firing."

"If we want to switch to something better, not to mention if I have the authority... even my wallet can't handle it."

The two looked at each other.

As the mighty lord of a stronghold, he was naturally glorious and feared by others.

But if one is a martial artist who has undergone body transformation, and looks at the bigger picture...

It was an unspeakable embarrassment. Not to mention anything else, just the "charcoal and firewood" alone was enough to weigh him down.

Even so, that "smokeless charcoal" was the lowest grade of charcoal.

Its firepower was insufficient.

A pot of fine food had to be boiled for nearly ten days to be barely cooked. If it were a better "treasure," the time would be even longer.

The charcoal consumption would naturally be even greater.

Ordinary firewood's heat couldn't even penetrate the cauldron walls.

There were no outsiders around at the moment, so Hong Kai said, "Boss, why don't we just stop practicing martial arts? Honestly be the lord of the stronghold. This money is enough for us to live very comfortably."

"Nonsense."

A sharp light flashed in Ma Daozi's eyes. "At your core, you're just a country farmer for your whole life, with a vision that's only this big."

"You say to stop practicing martial arts because you haven't seen the world above. If you had, even just a glimpse, you would never be willing to wallow in this mire."

"If I reach the Second Realm, I'm definitely going back!"

"What's so good about being a small stronghold lord, stuck in this godforsaken wilderness?"

Hong Kai looked at the wisp of white hair at the back of Ma Daozi's head and said no more.

Of the five masters of the Shan Feng Stronghold.

Hong Kai was the only one who had followed Ma Daozi the longest, for over a decade...

If one were to say who Ma Daozi trusted the most, it would undoubtedly be him. But it wasn't because their interests or personalities matched...

Hong Kai was already quite old when he joined the Shan Feng Stronghold, and his Qi and blood had started to decline.

He was ruthless in his methods, having skinned people in his early years. In reality, his martial arts weren't strong, and he had barely managed to circulate his Qi through his meridians to this day. But his Qi and blood had declined by half, so he had no chance of "consuming essence" in this lifetime.

That was why he was the only one who could talk to Ma Daozi about this matter.

He only knew a little about the world of martial artists who had undergone body transformation from Ma Daozi's scattered words.

"Second Brother, it seems Fifth Brother won't be coming back."

Ma Daozi looked into the distance. Seeing that it was already dark and several days had passed since Lu Xuefeng left, he suddenly said.

"Boss, this enemy..." Hong Kai's expression changed.

"The one who could kill Fifth Brother is probably... also a figure at the 'Consuming Essence' level," Ma Daozi said solemnly, touching the twin knives under his armpits.

"Boss, are we still going for revenge?" Hong Kai asked.

The moment the words left his mouth, he already knew the answer in his heart.

"Let's wait and see," Ma Daozi did not respond directly. "Since Fifth Brother isn't coming, his share of the [Fine Food], I plan to keep for myself."

"We've run out of charcoal anyway. I'll offer it to Mr. Chai to curry favor with him. I hope he'll give us a 30% discount next year, which will save us a lot of money."

"If I can get on Mr. Chai's good side, hehe, the burden of being the stronghold lord will be on your shoulders then. I'd be more than happy to take any job Mr. Chai gives me."

There was not a trace of hatred in his eyes, only a vague hope for the future.

They boiled for another day like this.

The fine soup was completed, its fragrance filling the air. Ma Daozi took a large portion, and the essence of heaven and earth flowed through his body. But he only absorbed a tiny wisp.

A portion was sealed in a special treasure box.

As for the soup and such, they were given to Hong Kai to drink.

It wasn't that Ma Daozi didn't want to swallow it all.

It was that a martial artist who "consumes essence," while capable of absorbing and digesting the essence of heaven and earth, has limited digestive ability. If he eats too much and can't digest it, the excess will still dissipate into the wind.

To preserve it, a special treasure box was needed.

But this item... was even more expensive than the "treasure" in Ma Daozi's hands.

When the two returned to the stronghold.

They saw it was empty. Ma Daozi went straight into the Hall of Brotherhood and saw a note on the table.

"The Sword-Breaking Madam?"

After reading the note, Ma Daozi showed no fear, no anger, no sadness, no joy. His mind was filled with confusion.

The Sword-Breaking Madam?

Who is that?

Ma Daozi thought:

"The writer is very arrogant, as if they have me completely figured out. Hmph, I, Ma Daozi, am no coward! If it really comes to a fight, why would I be afraid!"

"The Third Brother was cunning, the Fourth Brother was reckless, and the Fifth Brother was skilled. All died in that person's hands. My Shan Feng Stronghold is now empty, truly desolate. A huge loss."

But...

Ma Daozi felt a pang of anxiety in his heart.

"If I go all out and fight them, and the other party is also a [Consuming Essence] expert, there would be a great risk."

"My losses seem huge, but in reality, it's just that. The Third Brother had strategy, but he isn't irreplaceable. Besides, the stronghold lives by plunder, what need is there for great strategy?"

"The Fourth Brother was brave, but he was brainless and often messed things up. The Fifth Brother had great talent, hmph, if I had let him reach the Consuming Essence level, I'm afraid I wouldn't have been his match. I needed to find a way to kill him early."

There was never any real affection; it was all mutual exploitation. Now, calculating the benefits, upon second thought, the idea of revenge was put to rest.

But he couldn't just take such a big loss and pretend it never happened.

He kept this matter in his heart. When he met Mr. Chai in the future, he would ask him about the "Sword-Breaking Madam" and then make other plans.

"Master, as you expected, bandits have appeared in that stronghold again recently."

Uncle Fu hurried over.

Li Xian was very calm. It seemed the stronghold lord had returned.

"Master, should we just charge up there and kill them all?" Uncle Fu asked.

"No need."

Li Xian shook his head. "Keep a close watch. If they don't come to cause trouble, you don't need to make a move."

"Understood." Uncle Fu leaned on his crutch and spread the word through the village.

Although Black River Village had a great enemy in front of it.

But recently, everyone had enough to eat and wear, and the villagers' complexions had actually improved.

Li Xian already knew the result.

The Shan Feng Stronghold most likely wouldn't be coming to attack.

If they truly had affection, they would have already杀过来 (killed their way here).

But the Shan Feng Stronghold remained a hidden danger.

"If they don't come, my trap is useless."

Li Xian wouldn't say he was fully prepared, but he had exhausted his thoughts and calculations, and had a countermeasure in mind.

"Alright... for the next while, there will be some peace. I'll have fewer杂事 (trivial matters) to distract me and disturb my mind."

"Finally, a person can quietly practice martial arts!"

Li Xian circulated his internal Qi. His internal Qi surged, and a hot current flowed through his meridians, making his whole body feel energized.

Practicing martial arts...

Most of the time, it was all for the sake of cultivating this internal Qi.

"In two days, once the situation is completely stable, I'll go catch all the Crab Treasures!"

"Until then, my priority is to focus on improving my martial arts!"

Li Xian, relying on his memory, struck out two palms through the air.

Waves of air surged, with great momentum.

A martial artist's internal Qi must be sufficient to truly bring out the power of a martial art.

"I can put aside the Four Directions Fist for now."

"Next, I should practice the Azure Jade Palm and the Great Luo Saber!"

"The Azure Jade Palm, what exactly is so strange about this martial art? It made Qiu Yue's expression look so strange."

"Could it be... related to the Madam?"
