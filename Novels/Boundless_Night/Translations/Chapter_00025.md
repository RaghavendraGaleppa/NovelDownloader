# Chapter 25: Second Rebirth

Late at night, the world was like ink, all things losing their color, and the entire village was reduced to very blurry outlines.

Qin Ming was processing the Blood Serpent. The skin of this spiritual creature was incredibly difficult to peel; its scales were harder than refined iron, clanging loudly when struck with a cleaver. If one wasn't careful, the vibrant red scales could cut a person's fingers, seeming as if refined from pure gold. If crafted into armor, their defensive power would undoubtedly be astonishing.

Qin Ming tossed the cleaver aside, preparing to switch to a sharper tool. Two days prior, Mu Qingchu had given him a long-handled dark gold hammer, as well as a short sword. He tried it. Although not as sharp as the long sword of the dark-faced man, by gripping the short sword tightly and applying more force, it could barely be used to peel the snake skin. Qin Ming was exceptionally focused. After using the short sword to peel open one end of the great snake's skin, pulling downwards with force made it much easier than cutting directly.

Several sunstones emitted a soft glow, illuminating the Blood Serpent's body in a shimmering scarlet and brilliant red, as if it were a section of polished jade. After the crimson snake skin was gradually peeled away, the exposed flesh was pure white and delicate. The snake gall's color was unlike the dullness of ordinary snakes; it shimmered blue and was as translucent as a gemstone. Qin Ming had already noticed that both the snake meat and the snake gall contained rich and vibrant spiritual energy, faintly glowing, indicating they were superior nourishing ingredients.

"No wonder the people from Scarlet Cloud City immediately tore off their hypocritical masks upon seeing it, not hesitating to kill and plunder."

He used the short sword to cut the snake meat into sections. After carefully washing them, he immediately put a pot on to boil water. He would not delay his second rebirth for a single night. In such a grand environment, he felt a sense of crisis. All sorts of strange characters had appeared, and the great clans and organizations from Scarlet Cloud City were emerging one after another. Who knew what would happen next in the great mountains?

These people were all searching for the "nodes" in the mountains. Special areas were accompanied by unusual phenomena, especially the place where five-colored mists and clouds illuminated all directions, which they coveted immensely, willing to offer extremely rare high-level scriptures as a reward for clues. Since the mountain's magnetic field became chaotic, fire springs extinguished and then reappeared, and all sorts of strange things occurred.

"There's also a group of high-level creatures migrating from afar, bringing their families and seizing resources in the mountain range." Qin Ming pondered, "Could the so-called migration just be a cover? Are these newly arrived top-tier anomalous beings also looking for something?"

The snake meat was already in the pot, and as time passed, a rich aroma gradually emerged, causing Qin Ming to quickly pull back his thoughts and instantly feel his appetite soar. Late at night, the wind and snow raged fiercely. Inside the house, the snake meat pot emitted a rich, tantalizing fragrance. Qin Ming indeed had a strong appetite, patiently waiting for it to be thoroughly cooked.

"It's truly fragrant, and incredibly fresh." After taking the first bite, his eyes lit up. This spiritual creature tasted far better than ordinary snakes; it was like two different species. Originally, he had been somewhat averse to snakes, but now he didn't care at all. In his eyes, this was "dragon meat" on earth.

Qin Ming had only eaten a few mouthfuls when he felt a warmth rising within him. The effect was immediate; the spiritual substance was already taking effect so quickly.

"The snake gall can be steamed, or eaten steeped in strong aged liquor. Alas, there's no wine at home, so there's no choice." While eating the snake meat, he placed the shimmering blue snake gall into the steamer. This contained mysterious spiritual essence, and he needed to watch it carefully.

A moment later, the snake gall, like a large blue diamond, was thoroughly cooked. Qin Ming no longer paid attention to the snake meat and began to enjoy his true "main course."

"My... Mountain God, oh heavens, my heart is so bitter!" Qin Ming took only one bite and felt his tongue go numb with bitterness. He looked at himself in the mirror and found his lips had turned shimmering blue. He knew snake gall was bitter and had mentally prepared for it, but the concentrated essence of the Blood Serpent's gall was far more intensely bitter than he had anticipated. In that instant, he felt that even the snake meat no longer smelled fragrant; he was numbed by the bitterness.

He quickly drank a mouthful of the fragrant snake soup, washing the bitterness into his stomach, but the effect was not great; a strong bitterness still lingered in his mouth. In terms of taste alone, this stuff wouldn't be eaten even by a dog. It was unbearable even for a reborn one who had laid a foundation beyond the golden standard.

Qin Ming didn't swallow it whole, mainly because the snake gall was quite large, and also because he believed chewing it thoroughly would make it easier to absorb the spiritual essence and accelerate his second rebirth. His good mood from enjoying the delicacies all evening was almost ruined by the bitterness. Seeing there was still more than half a gall left, he gritted his teeth. Since it was like this already, he might as well continue to chew slowly.

After Qin Ming ate the entire snake gall, he looked in the mirror and found his lips seemed to be coated in an alluring blue, giving him an indescribably strange aura. "Fortunately, I ate it late at night. If it were earlier, I wouldn't be able to face anyone!"

However, the snake gall's effect was truly potent and extremely strong. Not long after consuming it, his entire body began to heat up, as if he had a high fever. Qin Ming remained calm, continuing to eat the snake meat, not only to suppress the bitterness but also to add more spiritual fire to his body. Eventually, his body began to radiate heat, like a vibrant furnace, repelling the severe cold of winter. His entire being was glowing.

"Food therapy, medicinal cuisine, the effects are here!" Qin Ming stood up, grabbed the long-handled dark gold hammer, and went into the courtyard to practice the killing moves from the blade manual.

Instantly, all the snow on the ground rushed towards the night sky. White mist swirled around his body, a faint light flowed over his skin, and vitality burst forth from his flesh and blood. As he wielded the great hammer, it brought forth gusts of wind and thunderous sounds. Qin Ming's entire essence, qi, and spirit continuously elevated. He knew that the second rebirth had begun; this was a process, not something achieved overnight. But he could clearly feel this change: his strength was increasing, his tendons seemed to be stretching, his perception was becoming sharper, and his eyesight was also strengthening.

"Each rebirth process is so captivating, feeling oneself grow stronger, even the dense, impenetrable night seems to have lightened a bit."

A large amount of active power surged within Qin Ming's body. His entire being felt as if it were being purified and baptized, his muscles and bones seemed to resonate and hum together. Under the night sky, his body was like a furnace, genuinely seen to be glowing. It was as if a secret flame burned within his flesh and blood, cutting away old impurities, promoting rebirth, tempering his essence, qi, and spirit, and accelerating the flourishing changes within his body.

Qin Ming wielded the long-handled dark gold hammer in the courtyard, continuously exerting himself until his hair was soaked and his body covered in sweat, only then did he enter the room. He sat quietly in the room, silently sensing the changes within his body. Afterwards, he pondered whether his body would grow again after the second rebirth. According to Old Man Liu, the bodily changes would vary greatly depending on the chosen spirit-qi technique and meditation method. Next, he would verify the quality of his "unorthodox path" of cultivation and see what kind of changes it would bring to his body.

Qin Ming was originally half a head taller than ordinary people, and after his first rebirth, he had grown nearly two more inches. In the evening, when he discussed rebirth with Old Man Liu and Xu Yueping, both of them felt that his height change was not significant, because some people could shoot up a whole head taller. Old Man Liu had rich life experience. In his youth, he had been very close to the older generation of mountain rangers and had heard many anecdotes about rebirth.

"Some spirit-qi techniques, after being practiced, cause the body to expand like a bubble with each rebirth, growing taller and taller. However, only a portion forms a solid golden body; most of it is merely 'mud embryo'. Therefore, many rebirth methods require suppressing the body's continued growth once a certain stage is reached." This was one of the situations Old Man Liu mentioned. He particularly mentioned that some secretly transmitted spirit-qi techniques were incredibly precious. After practicing them, extremely mysterious changes could occur, such as the birth of a third eye, from which certain sacred legends originated. Such secret texts were too rare, inaccessible even to many great clans.

While drinking, Old Man Liu fell into reminiscence, recounting all the anecdotes that the older generation of mountain rangers had told him in his early years, and then went on to describe some special rebirth methods, as well as their corresponding strange changes and effects. Finally, he also mentioned that there was a rebirth method that required maintaining the body's golden height ratio from the very beginning, not allowing the body to grow wildly. Old Man Liu looked at Qin Ming while drinking, and said drunkenly, "I think your height hasn't changed that much."

Qin Ming's mindset was peaceful. He only needed to wait two days to know which type his practiced rebirth method leaned towards. For the first time, he felt that information was indeed somewhat blocked here. He presumed that the reborn ones in Scarlet Cloud City were very clear about these things, while he had merely pieced together bits of information. Moreover, some people progressed not by relying on rebirth at all, but by other paths. These were too far removed for him to understand.

After sitting quietly for a long time, Qin Ming felt hungry. The changes from the second rebirth were very apparent. He immediately began to eat the snake soup, replenishing his body's needs with food rich in spiritual energy. Finally, after rinsing his body with cold water, he entered dreamland in the silent depths of the night. Before falling asleep, he vaguely saw a "golden thread and jade garment" reappear on his body. Silver light covered him, interwoven with golden threads, appearing quite mystical.

Qin Ming went from light sleep to deep slumber, and finally to a state of semi-consciousness. He felt he was in deep sleep, his body and mind completely relaxed, receiving excellent rest, but a part of his consciousness remained active. In a state between waking and sleeping, he seemed to see a dusty black cloth covering his subconscious, obstructing his vision, preventing him from seeing what lay beyond. But during the process of the second rebirth, the dust was gradually blown away, and a corner of that black cloth was lifted. Then, he saw himself from his ignorant childhood.

Although in a state of semi-consciousness, Qin Ming realized that the second rebirth led to a comprehensive improvement of his body, and even his mental consciousness was strengthening, which caused some blurred childhood memories to resurface. In a trance, it was as if someone whispered in his ear: "This path... although it has a significant origin, it can no longer be practiced."

Then, through the lifted corner of the black cloth, Qin Ming saw a rough, large hand holding a very thin ancient booklet, opening it to the first page before his young self...
