# Chapter 119: The Tai Sui Speaks, the Madam Travels

The alchemical recipe recorded: *Jade-Generating Glass Elixir* requires ten grams each of "Raw Yellow," "Tai Sui," "Dry Worm," and "Ancient Simplicity Seed."

However, the method of refinement was not recorded.

Li Xian sighed internally. If he could have seen the refining method, it would have been like finding gold. He had already gained a massive advantage for nothing.

Although he appeared loyal on the surface, he actually harbored ambitions of establishing his own sect. But everything must be built on a foundation of strength.

"Madam, is refining pills very difficult?"

Li Xian compared the prescription and searched along the medicine cabinet. Having interacted with Madam Wen frequently, he had figured out her temperament, so he dared to speak and ask questions much more boldly than before.

Pang Long held a blind respect and fear for the Madam, remaining loyal without daring to say a word. In reality, although the Madam was snobbish and cold, she was not someone impossible to converse with.

As long as one did not offend her, ordinary conversation and questions were fine.

Madam Wen was also gathering herbs. The true prescription for the *Jade-Generating Glass Elixir* existed in her mind. However, she often split the prescription into parts, storing them in the Yunxiang Pavilion or her usual residence.

The purpose was to facilitate constant recollection and study.

"It is indeed extremely difficult," Madam Wen said.

She moved gracefully to a spot, her fair fingers pulling open a medicine cabinet and taking out a white silken gauze bag.

With a flip of her delicate hand, the bag revealed over ten small bugs. Each one flashed with silver light and was extremely active.

"Silver Dragons... take four," she silently counted in her heart. She took out the bugs; even for her, this process required extreme caution.

Silver Dragons were strange insects of heaven and earth, possessing extreme toxicity that could rot flesh and blood in an instant.

They needed to be entangled with silken threads to gradually calm down. To prevent them from spraying toxins, Madam Wen pointed her finger in the air, using her Internal Qi to control the silk, wrapping the Silver Dragons tightly.

If Li Xian saw this, he would surely notice that Madam Wen's current Qi control technique was quite similar to the Azure Green Palm. However, the difference between the two was as vast as heaven and earth.

Once the four Silver Dragons were wrapped up, they fell into a dormant state. Madam Wen placed them into a brocade bag and immediately went to retrieve the next herb.

She was already very familiar with the Yunxiang Pavilion; she didn't need to think about where any medicinal herb was located. Her method of retrieving herbs was also an eye-opener.

It was very peculiar.

"Non-Firefly Water."

This was a special kind of water. It was transparent, colorless, tasteless, and formless. When opening the medicine cabinet, it looked as if it were empty.

The method of taking it was also quite interesting.

Madam Wen pulled out a thread from her clothes and took out a gold accessory from her waist.

She gently bent the gold accessory, turning it into a golden hook.

Then, she forced a drop of blood from her index finger. The blood was also very strange; although it was red, it had no fishy smell, but rather a scent.

The blood drop hung on the golden hook. She lowered the hook, suspending it inside the "Non-Firefly Water" cabinet.

Holding the silk thread, she was actually... using gold as a hook and blood as bait to fish for the formless, waterless substance.

The blood on the golden hook gradually turned blue.

But to fully retrieve the water, it still required time.

The herbs in this Yunxiang Pavilion were truly the treasures of her heart. Just taking them now was such a hassle; one could imagine how much hard work was required to collect them in the first place.

"Madam, you said... could I learn to refine pills?" Li Xian was still looking for herbs according to the prescription.

He still hadn't found the corresponding cabinet.

Madam Wen needed to wait quietly; this couldn't be rushed. She didn't排斥 Li Xian's question and said, "You want to learn to refine pills?"

Li Xian wanted to very much. Heaven rewards the diligent... if applied to pill refining, it would be incredibly powerful.

Since ancient times, pill refiners... were all professions with huge investments but unstable returns. Although Madam Wen was very serious about refining pills, there was a high possibility of failure in the end.

"It's not that I want to learn, I'm just extremely curious," Li Xian couldn't say he wanted to learn, lest the Madam suspect him. Moreover, he had just obtained the "先天洗胎图" (先天洗胎图), and now he was asking for the pill refining method; it would be too greedy, making the Madam realize his "wolfish ambitions."

He then asked, "Madam, do you think those people who took a single immortal pill and ascended to immortality really exist?"

Madam Wen said faintly, "Focus on gathering the herbs. If there is any negligence, you will go receive the rod punishment again."

Li Xian knew better and asked no more. Madam Wen fell into a memory; these strange tales might not necessarily be false.

"Found it!"

Li Xian was delighted to finally find the "Raw Yellow" medicine cabinet. There were hidden latches on both sides of the cabinet; popping them open would allow the cabinet to be pulled out.

Raw Yellow was a type of insect. It had a very strong fishy smell, a disgusting appearance, and was sticky. The inside of the medicine cabinet was full of mucus.

Fortunately, it was non-toxic.

Li Xian took a medicinal scale and poured the sticky insect into it. After measuring ten grams, he packed it into a special medicinal bag.

Only then did he breathe a sigh of relief.

Next was the "Tai Sui," which was right next to the Raw Yellow, just a few steps away.

"I had Tai Sui in my previous life too. I wonder if these two things are similar, or if they just happen to share the same name," Li Xian muttered.

He opened the hidden latch and pulled open the medicine cabinet. A foul stench rushed straight into his nasal cavity. It felt as if his mind had been struck by a heavy hammer, forcing him to step back three paces.

"This thing stinks so bad!" Li Xian covered his mouth and nose, feeling that the smell had no place to hide.

"Madam Wen asked me to gather the herbs; she probably finds this medicine disgusting and unwilling to do it herself, so she called me over!" Li Xian realized this and glanced at Madam Wen. He found that Madam Wen was also looking at him, her eyes filled with a hint of interest.

Li Xian's eyes turned red, and tears flowed wildly. It wasn't that he was crying, but the smell could stimulate tears. He squinted his eyes and approached again, finally seeing the true appearance of the Tai Sui.

It was a pitch-black meatball.

"It is similar to the description from my previous life, but there must be differences. They are two different things," Li Xian had practiced martial arts for half a year, enduring many hardships and dangers. But mostly it was fighting with people; these strange matters, led by the Madam today, he was finally seeing a glimpse.

There was a jade shear inside the medicine cabinet.

Li Xian cut from the edge, and a piece of meat fell off the Tai Sui.

"Ouch, which bastard is disturbing this大爷's sleep!" A curse suddenly rang out.

The black Tai Sui wriggled.

"Wen Caishang, you bitch, you're here to take meat from大爷 again to refine medicine!"

"Believe it or not,大爷 will spill all your dirty secrets!"

"Bitch, bitch, bitch!"

A barrage of curses came.

"Eh, who are you, kid? You dare to cut大爷? You got a death wish?" The black Tai Sui said.

Li Xian was greatly surprised and looked at Madam Wen.

Madam Wen said, "Ignore it, just weigh it."

Li Xian put the meat on the scale and found it was four grams short. He immediately cut with the jade shear again, but it was still one gram short.

"I apologize, Senior Tai Sui," Li Xian said. He cut with the jade shear again. The black Tai Sui cursed, "You瘟疫小子, you cut大爷 three times!"

"Can't you cut a bigger chunk at once and give the excess back to me? Ouch... my meat!"

Li Xian asked, "If I return the meat, can you use it?"

The Tai Sui said, "What废话, of course!" Hearing this, Li Xian became bold and cut off a large chunk at once.

After weighing ten grams, he returned the excess meat. The Tai Sui actually healed back to its original state instantly. It was truly strange and an eye-opener.

"What are you looking at? Hurry up and close it,大爷 wants to sleep!"

"Damn it, Wen Caishang, you bitch woman, I curse you to die a horrible death."

"Sigh, I've cursed you for years, and I haven't seen you die a horrible death. Eh, wait, I got it. This time大爷 will bless you, hehe. This kid is so ugly, I wish you get..."

The black Tai Sui was extremely noisy, chattering non-stop.

Madam Wen seemed tired of the Tai Sui's cursing, her expression calm and indifferent. She had heard since she was young that if a Tai Sui speaks, it often comes true.

But this black Tai Sui was clearly a different species; its words counted for nothing. It had cursed her for years without any sign of coming true. Moreover... if a Tai Sui speaks, it usually values words like gold, how could it rant and rave like this?

Li Xian closed the medicine cabinet, latched it, and the cursing could no longer be heard.

"Stinky, ugly, and noisy. No wonder the Madam asked me to get it. If it were a good thing, how could it be my turn?" Li Xian rubbed his nose. It was much better now.

Ancient Simplicity Seed was a type of mountain fungus.

It was also difficult to weigh, but compared to the Tai Sui, it was much easier. He quickly took ten grams. There was one last item, "Dry Worm."

He found the corresponding cabinet.

But when he opened it, he found the cabinet empty. There was no sign of the Dry Worm. Li Xian shouted, "Madam, the Dry Worm is gone."

"Gone?"

Madam Wen had already gathered ninety percent of her herbs. Hearing that the "Dry Worm" was depleted, she was taken aback.

She walked over quickly and saw that the cabinet was indeed empty.

It turned out that the last time the "Dry Worm" was used, it had been completely used up. Madam Wen, distracted by the black Tai Sui's noise, had overlooked this detail.

"Since the Dry Worm is empty... it seems we need to go out for a trip," Madam Wen frowned slightly.

Li Xian asked, "What about these herbs..." Madam Wen said, "Store them first. You make preparations and accompany me on a trip."

"Madam, am I going too?" Li Xian asked in surprise.

Madam Wen nodded, "What, are you unwilling to take this opportunity to see the world?"

Li Xian thought to himself: "The Madam is testing me again." He said, "I would love to, but if I go, there will be no one to oversee the guards in the manor, and Qingning County has been unstable lately. If bandits break into the manor, or even come here to steal herbs, that would be terrible."

Madam Wen saw that Li Xian was thoughtful and considerate. She raised her eyebrows slightly, very satisfied. But this time it wasn't a test; she had her own considerations:

"This boy is quite good and worth cultivating. This time leaving the manor, I will have to deal with the medicine trade, and there will surely be many miscellaneous people. It is better to take this boy along to run errands and obey my commands."

"Besides, he is young and handsome. Traveling with me, sending him to do things won't lose my face."

The Madam often went out of the manor.

But she had never taken Qiuyue or Pang Long out. The reason was that ordering them around would actually damage her own face.

It was ironic, but it was the truth.

She said:

"Make your preparations. This time, you will accompany me out of the manor."

Without further explanation, she moved her lotus steps, her long skirt dragging on the ground but not touching the dust, and left first.

Li Xian could only follow. By the time they left the Yunxiang Pavilion, it was already dusk.

Madam Wen said, "Leave the manor at the Xu hour (7-9 PM). If you are late by even a moment, forty rod punishments."

Li Xian was speechless, watching Madam Wen walk away. He didn't know if this trip would be long or short, but he imagined that dealing with the medicine trade would surely broaden his horizons.

He couldn't help but feel a bit of anticipation.

As for the Yunxiang Pavilion... since the Madam herself wasn't worried, he didn't need to be either.

"I didn't expect to be able to follow the Madam out to see the world so soon."

Xu Hour.

A lingering ray of the setting sun shone outside the manor entrance.

Li Xian stood tall and straight, full of youthful spirit. He wore a long sword at his waist and carried a golden bow on his back, waiting early at the door.

A fragrant jade carriage arrived.

It was Li Xian's first time seeing the Madam's travel attire.

The carriage had a smooth body, a black jade color. The body was made of black nanmu, and the craftsmanship was intricate all over. The connection between the wheels and the body incorporated complex mechanisms. Even on bumpy roads, the shocks wouldn't enter the carriage.

The carriage curtains were made of silk, inlaid with gold thread and pearls, with beautiful embroidery.

"Clothes make the man," the phrase popped into Li Xian's mind. Such a carriage arriving naturally could scare off most troublesome eyes.

Martial artists... were even more particular about their style.

Carriages, horses, and mansions were all about face.

Madam Wen lifted the curtain. Seeing Li Xian's heroic and upright posture, very extraordinary, completely unlike the country bumpkin of Qingning County, nor the noble son of a prestigious family.

He had a style and temperament of his own.

Madam Wen stared for a moment, thinking to herself: "I didn't notice before, but this boy really has some unique points."

She withdrew her gaze and lowered the curtain.

"Li Xian, you drive the carriage in front. Since it's rare to come out, let's first pay a visit to my friend in the Jianghu."

Her voice came from inside the carriage.
