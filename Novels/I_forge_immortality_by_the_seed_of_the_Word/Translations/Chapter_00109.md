# Chapter 107: River of Time Golden Sand

In just half a month, Zhang Jing had accumulated over 1.6 million spiritual essence fragments—a number he wouldn't have dared imagine when he was still in the third or fourth Void Heaven. As he had predicted, the rate of spiritual essence acquisition increased exponentially with each higher level of Void Heaven he reached.

"With this much spiritual essence and seventh Void Heaven privileges now available," Zhang Jing murmured, his gaze turning profound. In the next moment, his figure vanished from where he stood.

Upon entering the Myriad Treasures Repository, Zhang Jing immediately turned toward the left gate. Behind it sat Young Master, lounging comfortably on a rocking chair of unknown origin, looking utterly at ease. Yet as Zhang Jing approached, a flicker of surprise crossed Young Master's face.

*Seventh Void Heaven? How did this guy suddenly reach the seventh level without any fanfare?* 

The thoughts flashed through his mind quickly. "What would you like to exchange for?" Young Master asked, his usually sharp voice carrying an uncharacteristic hint of softness.

Zhang Jing's expression turned slightly odd. *Why the sudden change in attitude? Did he get reprimanded for his previous behavior, or has he been replaced entirely?* 

After a brief pause, Zhang Jing asked, suppressing his nervousness, "Young Master, am I now qualified to exchange for River of Time Golden Sand?"

His tension didn't stem from fear that Young Master would refuse—despite his temper, Young Master wouldn't violate the repository's rules. Rather, Zhang Jing was anxious to confirm whether the so-called "River of Time Golden Sand" could indeed be used to boost skill experience points on his jade talisman panel, as he had speculated.

"You can," Young Master replied, interrupting Zhang Jing's thoughts. "Eighteen thousand spiritual essence fragments per grain. How many do you want?"

"How many?" Zhang Jing answered without hesitation, "One grain for now."

He still needed to conserve spiritual essence for comprehending the Moonlight Dragon Python Dao Intent. Without confirming the golden sand's effects, he wasn't willing to waste even a single fragment.

"Just one?" Young Master couldn't help but scoff. With a flick of his hand, a minuscule grain of golden sand, no larger than a pinprick, materialized before Zhang Jing. It shimmered with an ethereal glow, its pale golden hue shifting between illusory and tangible states.

"River of Time Golden Sand!" Zhang Jing reached out and carefully caught it, his breath instinctively slowing as if afraid the slightest exhale might blow it away. Unnoticed, his spiritual essence decreased by 180,000.

"To use it, simply press it against your brow and focus your entire mind upon it," Young Master instructed. "Anything else you'd like to exchange for?"

"Not for now. Young Master, I'll take my leave."

"Don't let me keep you."

With a thought, Zhang Jing's figure, still cradling the golden sand, faded from the Myriad Treasures Repository.

Back atop Heavenly Summit Peak, a flash of light announced Zhang Jing's return. Slowly, he uncurled his fingers to reveal the mesmerizing grain of River of Time Golden Sand resting in his palm.

"How extraordinary!" Zhang Jing marveled as he examined it closely. The sand flickered between states—sometimes illusory, sometimes solid—as if existing partially beyond the material world. Moreover, its faint golden sheen gave Zhang Jing an inexplicable sense of timelessness, as though it remained untouched by the passage of ages.

Curious, he gently extended his spiritual sense toward the golden sand.

In an instant, a profound sensation washed over him—the endless flow of time, the relentless passage of epochs, the transience of all things beneath the river of years. It took him a full quarter-hour before his eyes cleared again.

"So this is the River of Time Golden Sand, containing three years' worth of time within it," Zhang Jing murmured, excitement bubbling beneath his calm exterior. "I hope it works as I imagine."

The jade talisman materialized before his eyes. His gaze swept across his various skills before finally settling on the Pure Origin Breath Visualization Art.

**[Pure Origin Breath Visualization Art - Level 7 (799/—)]**  
*Skill Traits: Gathering Essence Radiance (Low-grade), Crimson Spirit Radiance (Mid-grade), Dao-Guiding Radiance (High-grade)*

He had deliberately chosen not to use the golden sand on his sole top-tier inheritance, the Ocean-Subduing Dragon Seizing Void True Method. The reason was simple—now that his Dao Rhyme had transformed into Dao Intent, the technique had become largely obsolete for him. Meanwhile, the increasingly enigmatic Pure Origin Breath Visualization Art had quietly risen to become his top priority.

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Jing pressed the golden sand against his brow and poured his entire consciousness into it.

In that instant, the world around him drained of all color, fading into monochrome before dissolving into pure gray.

Zhang Jing felt as though he had been abruptly plucked from reality and deposited in some unknowable realm.

"A single moment outside, three years within?" A glimmer of understanding flashed in his eyes.

Sitting cross-legged, he began recalling the Pure Origin Breath Visualization Art's principles.

One month passed.  
One year.  
Three years.

Time flowed relentlessly, yet Zhang Jing remained motionless.

Back in the real world, his eyes snapped open. There was no trace of worldly weariness in his gaze—the experience had felt like nothing more than a fleeting dream. Whether three years or an instant had passed made little difference to his perception.

Then, fragments of insight began coalescing in his mind, gathering like droplets before surging forth as a roaring tide.

The jade talisman flickered erratically.

Moments later:  
**[Pure Origin Breath Visualization Art - Level 7 (3799/—)]**

At that very moment, Zhang Jing suddenly looked up at the sky.

A premonition struck him—he could faintly sense an immense, majestic presence. It didn't feel distant, yet something about it seemed veiled, as though separated by layers of thin gauze. The sensation lasted only a few breaths before vanishing entirely.

It took Zhang Jing half an hour to fully compose himself. That feeling had been strikingly similar to when he first witnessed the true form of the Aurora Magnetic Sea.

"What I sensed just now must be one of the other eight immortal foundation inheritances," he speculated. Though still a guess, he felt nearly certain.

His gaze drifted skyward once more. *The inheritance must be located in a higher Void Heaven.*

Recalling the earlier incident, he realized the connection—it was precisely when insights from the Pure Origin Breath Visualization Art flooded his mind that he had sensed the inheritance's presence.

"Which means this immortal foundation inheritance is deeply connected to the Pure Origin Breath Visualization Art? The Pure Origin Radiance?"

A contemplative gleam flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. To successfully obtain this "Path of the Celestial Immortal," he would likely need to first advance the Pure Origin Breath Visualization Art to the Seed of Law stage. Compared to the Aurora Magnetic Sea, this inheritance might prove far more suitable for him.

Caution was paramount.

But before that, he needed to ascend to a higher Void Heaven to locate its exact position.

"Which brings me back to needing spiritual essence—vast quantities of it!"

Rising to his feet, Zhang Jing sped toward the depths of Heavenly Summit Peak, where the roars of demonic spirits echoed without end.
