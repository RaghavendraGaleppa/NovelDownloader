# Chapter 228: The Switch on the Ice Cube

The broken window could no longer be closed.

The night wind blew in unbridled, shaping the curtains into wild forms.

The girl lay sideways facing him, her expression unreadable.

Through her dark hair, moonlight seemed to pool in the hollow of her collarbones.

With such a slender waist, she still possessed the defined lines of a mermaid.

If not for the flickering candlelight dancing upon her trembling eyelashes, one might mistake her for a jade sculpture.

Li Mo had always thought the scene of someone getting a nosebleed from a surge of blood was exaggerated, but seeing this, he knew he had wronged those stories.

Perhaps they were actually realistic.

"Is it... too dark?"

"It's very white."

"Huh?"

Sensing the boy's gaze, Ying Bing retracted her own, feeling a strange itch on her skin, though she wasn't sure if it was just her own hair.

Was he only interested in feet?

"A '一条龙服务' (one-stop service), does that include staring at me the whole time?" Ying Bing asked softly.

"Please do not doubt my professionalism."

Li Mo covered his nose and shook his head seriously.

People yearn for beautiful things.

He was just purely appreciating the masterpiece of the graduate design of Nüwa. Yes, that was it.

"You can lie flat first."

"Alright."

Anyway, what must come will come; it might as well come quickly.

Her expression was indifferent; it seemed her mental adjustment earlier had been quite effective.

She just never imagined that the 'Sword Heart Clarity' would ever be used in such a situation.

Seeing Ying Bing so open and aboveboard, Li Mo took a deep breath.

**[Ten years of martial arts insight injected successfully.]**

**[Year 1: Through continuous practice, you finally mastered all the acupoints of this martial art. With a casual point of a finger, you can locate the exact spot.]**

**[Year 4: You continuously researched the finger techniques and discovered that different acupoints and finger techniques could resonate with each other, creating an effect greater than the sum of their parts.]**

**[Year 10...]**

**[Your 'Twisting Flower Finger' has reached initial proficiency.]**

As a supreme technique, Li Mo mastered it quite quickly?

It was... quite sudden.

Glancing at the jade-like body lying beside him, Master Li felt a slight stir.

**[Ten years of martial arts insight injected successfully...]**

**[Ten years of martial arts insight injected successfully...]**

...

And so, the 'Twisting Flower Finger' was perfected. Even the massage masters in the Imperial Capital would have to serve tea to Young Master Li if they met him now.

There were still 80 years of spare martial arts insight left.

Don't ask about the spare; isn't this exactly when it comes in handy?

"I just learned this technique; it's quite powerful. Let me know if you can't handle it."

"I won't."

Ying Bing didn't even look up as she replied calmly.

No sooner had the words left her mouth than she felt one of her long, jade-like legs being lifted. A酥麻 (numbing) electric current sensation came from the Yinlingquan acupoint, slowly dissipating just as it had before.

When he pressed on the Diji acupoint, the sensation became even stronger.

Yinlingquan was below the knee bend, and Diji was on the calf.

Further down were Sanyinjiao and Taichong...

The current traveled all the way to her toes.

Li Mo asked confidently, "Do you feel it?"

"Average," Ying Bing closed her beautiful eyes.

"?"

Master Li leaned back slightly.

This shouldn't be happening; how could it be just average?

Hmm... Could it be that because the Ice Cube has been washed by the Taiyin aura for years, her acupoints and meridians are exceptionally open and tough, making her completely unresponsive to normal stimulation?

Master Li had just elevated his finger technique to the level of a supreme master.

Hearing the word 'average,' he couldn't help but be provoked.

"How about here?"

"Mm... Average."

"And here?"

"No sensation."

"???"

From her legs to her shoulders, Master Li couldn't understand how this soft, brocade-like body could endure so much pressure.

He couldn't possibly use those forbidden moves...

Li Mo's gaze drifted downward.

The Ice Cube seemed to sense his gaze and blocked him with her forearm, but this only changed the shape of things rather than stopping him.

"Turn over."

---

Li Mo wiped the tip of his nose.

Ying Bing glanced at the system prompt.

**[Current touch area: 42%]**

After turning over, she tightly closed her eyes and let out a breath.

But once her back was turned, she felt a strange sensation from behind.

"What... did you drop?"

"Hundred Fruit Heavenly Fragrance Oil."

"Mm..."

She did smell a fragrance.

She just didn't know why, at first, she felt the drop of liquid was a bit hot, but then it was gone.

Her skin felt slightly warm...

That electric-like touch seemed even stronger...

"Do you feel it?"

"No."

"Not even this?"

"Mm..."

Li Mo, deep in thought, noticed something was off.

When he pressed her side waist, her delicate hands would curl slightly.

When he pressed her thigh, her toes would tense.

It was like she had a switch...

"Really not?" Li Mo looked doubtful.

"No."

No sooner had Ying Bing spoken than—

**[Ding-dong—]**

**[Detected that the host is completely insensitive to touch.]**

**[The system has kindly increased your sensitivity by 50%.]**

"?"

She opened her eyes, looking slightly dazed.

The same touch now felt... stickier.

Why is it again...

Li Mo, completely unaware of the system's intervention, pressed his hand against her butt.

"Haa..."

Ying Bing shrank her neck slightly, but she couldn't hide the flush spreading across her neck, her mind trembling.

Li Mo: "..."

The ever-unyielding Ice Cube.

How else could she become the Empress of the Phoenix?

Time passed.

**[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Ying Bing' and helping her regulate her aura.]**

**[You have an investment reward waiting to be claimed.]**

" asleep?"

Seeing Ying Bing motionless, Li Mo felt a bit strange inside.

Then he left with a serious expression.

Only his steps were a bit awkward and flustered.

Hearing the footsteps fade and the door close, the room finally heard a soft gasp.

Ying Bing opened her eyes, looking slightly dazed. Unfortunately, Li Mo had gone to take a shower, so he didn't see these complex eyes filled with the night.

**[Detected that the host has completed the punishment conditions, rewards are being issued...]**

**[Reward 1: Azure Luan Wings]**

**[Azure Luan Wings]:** "Can be activated with True Origin to make the body as light as a feather. Can be manifested through the soul to soar through the sky, reducing the suppression of the Inner Scene field."

**[Reward 2: Moon Soul Crystal]**

**[Moon Soul Crystal]:** "A fragment of the Taiyin (Great Yin) that fell from the heavens when the Way of Taiyin was perfected in ancient times. A holy item for enhancing the soul."

**[Reward 3: Demon Slaying Gourd]**

...

The system's punishment was finally over.

But she suddenly had no desire to even look at the rewards, her limbs feeling weak.

"This is the third punishment."

"It gets worse each time..."

Ying Bing changed her clothes, staring blankly at the moonlight outside the window.

She could no longer be certain that she had the upper hand.

After all, the three previous failures were right before her eyes.

Then... what about next time?

What will it be... this time?

...
