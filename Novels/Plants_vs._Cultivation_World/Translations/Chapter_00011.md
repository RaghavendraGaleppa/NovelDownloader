# Chapter 11: Progress in Qi Refinement

Gu Mo was just about to begin his cultivation when he had to stop—he had received a message from Yao Shifeng via a paper pigeon. This method of communication was commonly used among low-level cultivators, known for its poor speed and lack of confidentiality. However, within the sect, it was perfectly adequate for transmitting non-sensitive information.  

Most importantly, these message pigeons were cheap, making them affordable for outer disciples like them.  

Upon receiving the message, Gu Mo immediately set off for the meeting place. Yao Shifeng’s emergence from seclusion meant he had successfully stepped into the Qi Refinement stage.  

When Gu Mo arrived at the familiar private dining room, Wu Jinfei, Hu Hai, and Chu Feifei had already gathered. After several months apart, the three had undergone noticeable changes, with Chu Feifei’s transformation being the most striking. Compared to the somewhat disheveled appearances of Wu Jinfei and Hu Hai, Chu Feifei now seemed even more radiant and captivating.  

What Gu Mo didn’t realize was that his own arrival had also left Wu Jinfei, Hu Hai, and Chu Feifei puzzled. Thanks to his mastery of the Cleansing Technique, Gu Mo had already begun the process of marrow cleansing—a phenomenon typically seen only after entering the Qi Refinement stage. Thus, to the three of them, Gu Mo exuded an aura akin to that of a senior disciple who had already achieved Qi Refinement.  

"Gu Mo, what stage are you at now?" Wu Jinfei voiced the question on everyone’s minds.  

"Still four months away from Qi Refinement," Gu Mo replied after a brief consideration. His original plan had been to reach Qi Refinement in six months, and four months had already passed. In theory, he should have only two months left. Though his progress had been slightly delayed due to the time spent dispelling the black mist, making up for it was simple—he just needed to redirect the solar essence originally used for purification toward cultivation instead.  

Of course, Gu Mo deliberately downplayed his progress. Claiming eight months to reach Qi Refinement seemed like a safer estimate.  

Yet even this modest answer shocked the trio. They knew Gu Mo had traded his sect-supplied pills to Yao Shifeng for spirit stones. Under such circumstances, keeping pace with the group was no small feat—especially since Gu Mo had also spent time mastering a low-tier spell.  

"You all must be close to Qi Refinement as well, right?" Noticing their stunned expressions, Gu Mo paused before realizing his miscalculation. Still, it wasn’t a major issue. Only extreme cases like Fan Shaoming would draw undue attention—his own situation was hardly noteworthy.  

"I’ve got about two months left," Wu Jinfei declared with a hint of pride. Though he couldn’t compare to Yao Shifeng, he still held a clear advantage over the others.  

"Three more months should do it," Hu Hai mused.  

"Well… I think I can attempt Qi Refinement in about a month," Chu Feifei admitted hesitantly. Originally, she had estimated needing three more months before she could confidently attempt the breakthrough. However, every time she used the Cleansing Technique on herself, her cultivation speed increased slightly.  

This unexpected boost had significantly accelerated her progress, allowing her to attempt Qi Refinement a full two months ahead of schedule. The sudden advancement left her both thrilled and uneasy—she couldn’t quite explain the inexplicable surge in her cultivation speed.  

Unlike Gu Mo, who concealed his progress due to genuine secrets that might attract unwanted scrutiny, Chu Feifei had no reason to hide hers. She lacked Gu Mo’s ability to control her cultivation speed at will—she could only push forward with all her strength. Besides, her current pace wasn’t particularly eye-catching. Compared to Yao Shifeng, who had already broken through, Chu Feifei’s one-month delay was hardly remarkable.  

Since her progress wouldn’t invite suspicion, Chu Feifei saw no reason to hold back. The sooner she broke through, the sooner she could secure an advantage.  

After all, hadn’t Yao Shifeng borrowed resources from everyone precisely to accelerate his breakthrough? Today, he had succeeded, becoming the second among their group of outer disciples to enter the Qi Refinement stage.  

**"What?!"**  

Wu Jinfei reacted most strongly to Chu Feifei’s revelation. Based on the luminosity test during their initial assessment, Chu Feifei had ranked fourth—only slightly above Gu Mo. Yet in just a few months, she had surpassed even him. How could he not be shocked?  

"What’s got you all so worked up?"  

Yao Shifeng stepped into the room, his refined demeanor exuding confidence—a stark contrast to his previously unkempt appearance. The transformation brought about by his breakthrough was undeniable.  

"Boss, we were just discussing our cultivation progress," Wu Jinfei explained, summarizing everyone’s status. Upon hearing about Chu Feifei’s advancement, Yao Shifeng’s eyes flickered with surprise, but he dismissed it quickly. Minor anomalies like hers were insignificant.  

After all, the luminosity test wasn’t infallible—some variance was normal. If Chu Feifei truly had some extraordinary opportunity, she would have already broken through instead of needing another month.  

Having entered Qi Refinement as the second-ranked disciple, Yao Shifeng was brimming with ambition. Chu Feifei’s minor peculiarity barely registered in his mind.  

Even the faint aura of marrow cleansing around Gu Mo only earned him a brief glance. In Yao Shifeng’s eyes, cultivation realm was what truly mattered—no matter how well one mastered the Cleansing Technique, it was ultimately superficial.  

He assumed Gu Mo’s unusual aura was simply the result of frequent self-cleansing.  

With Yao Shifeng’s arrival, the focus naturally shifted to him. In return for their support, which had been crucial to his breakthrough, he generously shared his insights on entering Qi Refinement.  

"Gu Mo, do you have any questions?" Yao Shifeng made a point of addressing him. Though Gu Mo’s talent was lacking, he was the only one who had willingly traded his pills. Such a person was hard not to appreciate, and Yao Shifeng was happy to lend him a hand if possible.  

Gu Mo had no real questions—he wouldn’t encounter any bottlenecks before Qi Refinement. But to avoid standing out, he still posed one.  

As the group exchanged questions and answers, time flew by. When night fell, their gathering came to an end, marking a temporary farewell between them and Yao Shifeng.  

Having reached Qi Refinement, Yao Shifeng would soon leave to become an outer disciple assigned to the Talisman Peak.  

Technically, he could have stayed until the end of the year, but Yao Shifeng had no intention of doing so. He had pushed himself to break through early precisely to gain an edge over others. He intended to leverage this advantage to secure further opportunities.  

"Until we meet again—hopefully when all of you have also reached Qi Refinement," Yao Shifeng clasped his hands in farewell before turning away without hesitation. On the path to strength, nothing would hinder his progress.
