Chapter 266: Silent Fortune, Punishing the Luo Maiden, Pride Shattered, Consuming the Human Yellow

Dusk had fallen. All of Li Xian’s schemes and desires had been fulfilled. What remained was the cleanup.

The corpse of the Black-Faced Bat King reeked of foulness. Having practiced unorthodox martial arts and consumed filthy things for a long time, it rotted and spawned maggots the moment it died. Black fluid flowed from its wounds, and its body swelled like an inflated leather bag. Suppressing his nausea, Li Xian searched the body thoroughly as he buried it, taking out all the gold, silver, treasures, and strange artifacts.

He filled the hole with dirt and stomped it down firmly, letting out a soft breath. Li Xian thought, *“Although the corpse is buried, the signs of digging are still visible. It’s too easy to be discovered.”*

He drew the Sinking River Sword and hacked at branches, leaves, bushes, and weeds, scattering them nearby to conceal all traces. He had always been meticulous and cautious. In this dense, verdant forest, no one would ever know where the Black-Faced Bat King was buried. The Essence Treasure, the Yellow Nine Ginseng, had fallen into Li Xian’s hands.

With everything settled, he let out a slight sigh of relief.

Li Xian flipped the Sinking River Sword, examining its blade. He secretly marveled at it as a true treasure. Digging and shoveling earth just now was a tremendous waste, yet the edge remained as sharp as ever. However, such actions inevitably shortened the sword’s lifespan and dulled its sharpness. The blade now bore faint scratches, and its durability had greatly decreased.

*“All things in the world are constantly wearing down. The Sinking River Sword is of exceptional quality, forged by the master smith Ouyang Zi. Even such a precious sword is not immune to damage. It’s a pity... repairing the scratches on the blade is very difficult. It would require a master swordsmith like Ouyang Zi to do so.”*

The precious sword was tarnished. Li Xian channeled his Qi into it with a shake, and it once again emitted a chilling gleam.

Besides the three great treasures, the Black-Faced Bat King had many other miscellaneous items. Li Xian had already placed them on a patch of grass nearby.

He immediately used the Black-Faced Bat King’s black cloak as a sack. Wrapping all the遗物 (yíwù - legacy items/possessions of the deceased) inside, he slung it over his back. Then, he picked up Luo Feiyan.

As expected of the Golden Hairpin of Xiu City, even in her deep sleep, her posture was graceful. The rise and fall of her breathing was full of charm. If the Luo family obtained such a junior, they would surely cherish her like a pearl.

Li Xian activated his lightness technique, flashing through the forest. A gentle breeze lifted the hem of Luo Feiyan’s skirt. Her clothes were already in disarray, which naturally added a touch of spring allure. Li Xian had no mind to admire it, keeping one eye on his surroundings while observing Luo Feiyan’s breath.

Although her hands were bound, the martial arts she had displayed earlier were already formidable. Such a simple restraint would not hold her for long. However, the Golden Leopard Sinew was of limited length and could only be bound loosely. Lacking a better binding technique, he had to make do for now.

He paid close attention to her movements. If she showed signs of waking, he would administer more of the paralytic drug to let her sleep soundly, which was beneficial for both. After walking for half an hour, he saw her eyebrows twitch slightly, as if she were about to wake.

Li Xian immediately increased the dosage of the paralytic drug and fed it to her with water. Luo Feiyan’s eyes fluttered open in a daze. She vaguely caught a glimpse of Li Xian before her eyelids grew unbearably heavy, and she fell back into a deep sleep.

Inside a cave.

Li Xian temporarily took shelter, using weeds to block the cave entrance. He began to sort through the miscellaneous items he had acquired.

A Bat Cloak... Li Xian had seen how the Black-Faced Bat King wrapped himself in it to dissipate palm strikes and protect his body. At the time, he suspected that while the Bat King was powerful, this cloak must hold some secret.

So he scrutinized it carefully, pondering its strange properties and wondering if he could use it. He found the cloak to be sticky on the outside and smooth on the inside, extremely tough. Even with his immense strength, it was difficult to tear. The exterior was covered in black bat fur, which was fine and dense. If inhaled into the lungs, it would pierce them, making it a very formidable weapon.

Li Xian secretly庆幸 (xìngqì - felt fortunate): *“It was a close call not to have tangled with him for too long. The Black-Faced Bat King surely had other tricks up his sleeve that he didn't use!”*

The inside was made of poison eel skin, which could seep venom and was sticky and slippery. Wrapping the whole body in it was like donning a slick snake-skin suit.

*“What a peculiar thing, but it’s too disgusting. Besides... it’s not very convenient for me to use, and it’s too eye-catching to carry.”*

He discarded it deep inside the cave.

The remaining miscellaneous items were: seven taels of broken silver, a Sky-Concealing Narrow Box, a set of bone tools, poison powder, a mouth flute, a music score...

The Sky-Conceiling Narrow Box contained "Essence Treasure Soup." It should have had Essence Meat inside, but it had all been consumed. The remaining Essence Soup had already dissipated its worldly essence.

Li Xian poured it out and washed the box with clean water. He reached for the side pouch at his waist. Inside were two Sky-Concealing Boxes, both empty. Li Xian had not consumed an Essence Treasure for a long time since he drank the Golden Scale.

Now, the worldly essence in his body only remained as "fifty-nine wisps," which would be fully absorbed in a few days. Li Xian pondered: *“Although I have obtained the Yellow Nine Ginseng... according to the Golden Light Dietary Manual, there are conditions to be met before consuming this Essence Treasure. Otherwise, the technique will be impure, and I don't know what kind of technique it will be.”*

*“It’s time to replenish my Essence Treasure.”*

Wen Caishang had told him that when walking in the Jianghu, if one worries about Essence Food, one can visit large cities more often. The "large cities" she referred to were cities of a certain caliber. What does that mean?

The Great Wu Empire is vast, but there is a rough territorial map. This map only depicts the general shape of the territory and marks some important cities.

Any city, big or small, that appears by name on this "National Map" can be considered "of caliber." The forces of sects, cities, and families in the Great Wu Empire are scattered like stars. It's impossible to know all the strange and bizarre places. However, the cities recorded on the National Map are well-known to martial artists.

This alone shows their significance.

The larger the city, the richer the resources.

If there is a grand event in the city, those in power will set up large cauldrons, light great fires, stew Essence Food, and distribute it widely. If one has the ability, one can certainly get a share.

The affairs within are magnificent and vast.

Li Xian sorted through the spoils one by one. He took the useful items with him and buried the useless ones on the spot. He couldn't help but sigh. While he was delighted with the abundant harvest, carrying everything was cumbersome. But he had no fixed residence, his heart was like duckweed, where could he put them?

Li Xian thought of the wonder of Wen Caishang sheathing her sword and disappearing in an instant. If he could do that, all these miscellaneous items around him would have a place to go.

By this time, night was falling.

The scattered travelers of the Jianghu usually moved in small groups of three or four. Seeing that it was getting late and fearing an encounter with the Black-Faced Bat King, they grouped together, forming parties of seven or eight.

Li Xian, based on the map, broke away from the crowd. He carried Luo Feiyan out of the wilderness and sneaked into the "Silk Family Town" east of Xiu City.

From a distance, cotton fields stretched as far as the eye could see. The local feng shui and climate were extremely suitable for cultivating cotton and fruits. Li Xian thought: *“Actually, just looking at the farmland and products... the Poor Heavenly Province is still richer than my previous world. There are many places with two or three harvests a year, but most of the wealth flows into the pockets of the great aristocratic families. This part is no different. People are like this, for thousands, tens of thousands of years... I'm afraid it will never change.”*

He saw that Luo Feiyan was about to wake up again and immediately fed her more of the paralytic drug. Luo Feiyan murmured softly, "Young Master Hua... where is this..." before gently falling asleep again.

After continuous doses, the drug's effect had noticeably weakened. Li Xian estimated it could only keep her unconscious for half an hour now. He needed to find a way to deal with Luo Feiyan completely.

The small town was quiet. The shops were closed at night, with only a few inns open. Li Xian first found a place to put Luo Feiyan, then entered a shop alone to rent a room. After going upstairs, he climbed out the window, carried Luo Feiyan on his back, and sneaked into the room.

By doing this, he could avoid the eyes and ears of the innkeeper and the attendant.

The furniture in the room was all made of "Golden Silk Wood," extremely luxurious. Li Xian rented the room for three days, spending seven taels of silver. This wasn't because he was rich and arrogant, but because he planned to leave Luo Feiyan here. He would need the inn's staff to run errands later, so he showed off his wealth to ensure he wouldn't be neglected.

After putting Luo Feiyan down, Li Xian sneaked out of the inn to find something that could bind her tightly. He thought: *“I'll tie her up first, keep her trapped for a few days, and then have someone discover her. By then, I'll be long gone, merged into the vast sea of people. Who could find me?”*

A martial artist's cultivation realm adds a rhythm to their body, aligning it with the heavens and earth. A martial artist of the second realm has many strange methods, and it is very difficult to bind and capture them. Ordinary coarse ropes, even if tough... because of their simple material, can be escaped with many techniques.

He feared it would be difficult to imprison her for long.

Li Xian walked through the town, thinking about how to trap Luo Feiyan to buy himself more time to escape. He passed a lake and saw a sect's headquarters.

The signboard had three large characters, "Panhu Gang," written with powerful, flowing strokes, full of imposing momentum.

Li Xian thought that gang conflicts were brutal, and their forces were complex. While killing was common, kidnapping and blackmail also occurred. Therefore, many gangs must have unique secrets for capturing people.

Or they might have items like "Tiger Sinew Rope."

So he lightened his steps and sneaked over the wall.

The hall was guarded, with people patrolling in small groups. They were all ordinary people, who, although they had practiced a few martial arts and cultivated a trace of internal Qi, had not yet reached the level of Food Essence. Small gangs like this, which had dominated for years, should not be underestimated. They might be able to find one or two Food Essence martial artists.

Li Xian stepped with the Seven Star Step and activated the mystery of the "Light Word Secret." His body was light and ethereal, landing without a sound. He saw that the back of the hall was a courtyard with red flowers and green trees, full of vitality, and a lake with rockeries... it was surprisingly luxurious.

*“So extravagant. I wonder how much wealth from the people they have scraped together. This world is truly one where the drought-stricken suffer drought, and the flood-stricken suffer floods.”*

Li Xian moved nimbly and saw a row of houses. Inside, there were sounds of laughter and chatter, the sound of men and women playing and chasing each other. Li Xian guessed it must be about those vulgar matters. He raised his eyebrows slightly and couldn't help but open his Heavy Pupil to look. The Panhu Gang's leader, with a big belly but already at the Food Essence realm, was playing and chasing several concubines.

Their clothes were all disheveled, very revealing. The various utensils in the room were shocking to the eye.

Li Xian sighed, not knowing if it was envy or emotion. He averted his gaze and searched through the prison, the storeroom, and other places one by one. In a dungeon, he found a ten-zhang-long Tiger Sinew Rope.

It was very old. The tiger sinew had lost its elasticity, but it was extremely solid. This kind of rope had the ability to "seal sinews and lock bones." Once tied tightly, the sinews couldn't move and the bones couldn't shift, making it impossible to struggle... even if one practiced a martial art like "Bone-Shrinking Art," it would be difficult to break free. Li Xian thought it would be more than enough, so he returned along the way and headed straight for the inn room.

Taking advantage of Luo Feiyan's deep sleep, he put the Tiger Sinew Rope on her. Using the technique of "Draping the Silken Garment," he crisscrossed the ropes. Her wrists and elbows, ankles and knees, were all tightly bound, and then her hands and feet were folded back and tied together securely.

By this time, she was in a very sorry state.

Draping the Silken Garment was a refined technique, and the Tiger Sinew Rope was as thick as a finger, vastly different from the "Silk Thread Jade Green Rope." It was difficult to achieve the level of seeing only the "silken garment" without seeing the knots. Moreover, due to the difference in rope quality, some complex knots could not be used. But it was indeed sufficient.

Luo Feiyan frowned slightly, but the drug's effect was still there.

Li Xian suddenly thought: *“When she wakes up and discovers her situation, she will surely want to fight and kill, to peel my skin and eat my flesh.”*

When he was at the Panhu Gang's headquarters, he had casually taken a few numbing walnuts. He pried open her lips and stuffed the walnuts into her cheeks. He figured she wouldn't be able to spit out the walnuts or speak. Then he put her on the bed and covered her with the quilt.

Luo Feiyan's brows were slightly furrowed, showing signs of waking.

Li Xian asked the inn attendant for paper and ink, and wrote: "Miss Luo, farewell. Rest assured, I will only leave you here for a few days. Someone will come to rescue you in due course. No one knows about our affair, please keep it a secret."

He placed the note on the table. With Luo Feiyan's eyesight, she would surely be able to see the writing.

Then he wrote another letter. The letter was concise: "The Black-Faced Bat King is at the Silk Family Town inn. Come quickly."

He wrapped the note and handed it to the inn attendant. Li Xian gave him three taels of silver and instructed him solemnly: "Deliver this to the Luo family in three days. It's a matter of great importance. There will be another ten taels of silver for you once it's done."

The inn attendant was overjoyed and showered him with flattery. Li Xian smiled faintly. He was a habitual liar and had deceived someone again. The "ten taels of silver" in his words was just bait. In three days, he would be long gone.

After handling everything, Li Xian hid outside the guest room. He secretly observed... to see if Luo Feiyan could break free.

Luo Feiyan slowly woke up, feeling that her eyelids were suddenly heavy. Her head ached terribly. Her hair was disheveled, and in her dazed state, she couldn't make sense of the situation.

*“I killed the Black-Faced Bat King... then I fainted. What on earth happened? Did the Black-Faced Bat King have a hidden trump card? Or was it that Hua... Hua Manlou...”*

Her memories gradually became clear. Suddenly, a chill ran through her body. She remembered the reason for her unconsciousness: she had been struck in a major acupoint. Luo Feiyan also felt a splitting headache. She shook her head gently, wanting to use her hand to rub her temples.

Luo Feiyan was stunned: *“I... seem to be unable to move?”* Her hands were pressed tightly against her back, her wrists bound. Her expression changed drastically, filled with panic. She tried to move her limbs, but they were all tightly bound. She wanted to speak, but she couldn't get the words out.

She said, "Hua Manlou! You bastard!" But her curses came out as muffled sounds.

*“I need to be calm... I seem to be tied up. There's no one in the room, heh. That Hua Manlou is extremely cunning. He changes his appearance and blends into the crowd, being secretive. I figured he was up to no good, and sure enough, he harbored malicious intent. I... I was... exhausted at the time and trusted that scoundrel easily. But he could never have imagined that ropes cannot hold me.”*

Luo Feiyan activated the "Embroidered Body Art." This martial art was very powerful. By making slight vibrations with her body, it made the silk threads flow. Any ordinary rope in the world could be instantly undone with this technique.

This was exactly what Li Xian was worried about.

Luo Feiyan frowned, feeling that the Embroidered Body Art was useless. After several attempts, the ropes remained tightly fastened. She exclaimed, "Could this be a specially made restraint?"

The Luo, Zhang, and Zhou families of Xiu City were hegemons. There were hidden struggles between them. The Zhang and Zhou families had devices specifically for capturing Luo family members. The Zhang family's "Iron Ring Cuffs" could render the Luo family members helpless. The Zhou family's "Red Bag," once it covered a Luo family member, could also capture them on the spot.

Luo Feiyan's face turned pale. If this was the case, there must be a greater scheme behind it. Could capturing her be to threaten her family? Or other possibilities?

Miscellaneous thoughts surged up. But she quickly calmed down. She looked down at herself and saw that it was just an ordinary Tiger Sinew Rope. The key to its effectiveness was not the specialness of the restraint, but the uniqueness of the binding method.

It turned out that...

Although the Luo family's Embroidered Body Art was powerful and unique, it was ultimately no match for the "Silken Garment Misplaced Jade Art." Even though Li Xian had simplified it greatly, its "internal cultivation method" was still more than enough for "binding and capturing."

Luo Feiyan twisted her waist, feeling that her hands and feet were both bent backward. The key joints of her entire body were being tightly restricted. Even a top martial artist, constrained like this, would be unable to do anything. She could only lie there honestly and wait for her fate.

She felt extremely aggrieved. There was a bronze mirror in the room. Seeing her own sorry and trapped state in the mirror, she felt unbearably ashamed and wished she could find a hole to hide in. In her heart, she cursed Li Xian countless times.

Since martial arts were useless, she tried simple methods instead. Her fingers probed for the knots. She could easily reach the knots, but they were very complex. After trying every way, she finally gave up.

She couldn't help but feel extremely dejected and gave up completely. She waited for half an hour, but there was no sign of Li Xian. Moonlight spilled into the window, shining on her face.

She was speechless and extremely frustrated. She thought of how, during the day, she had even considered the possibility of a marriage alliance with Li Xian. In the blink of an eye, she had fallen into the hands of a villain.

She was filled with angry words, waiting for a chance to speak, hoping to unleash a torrent of abuse. But the room was extremely quiet, and she couldn't move. The loneliness was imaginable. Moreover, it was hard to be at ease, not knowing Li Xian's purpose, or if he had accomplices. She was now unable to move, like a fish on a chopping block. Whether Li Xian would butcher, cook, or eat her, she could not resist in the slightest.

The more she thought about it, the more terrified she became.

Until in a daze, she saw a letter pressed on a distant table. After reading what was written on it, she finally felt relieved. But thinking that when someone came to rescue her, they would see her in such a miserable state...

Her reputation as the Golden Hairpin would surely be ruined. She barely let out a sigh of relief, only to feel anxious again.

Li Xian observed until midnight. Seeing Luo Feiyan trapped and helpless, he felt a bit more at ease.

*“This little wench was extremely arrogant at first. Letting her learn a lesson is a good thing. Hmm... I hope she reflects on herself properly.”*

Li Xian, with a heart full of mischief, found Luo Feiyan's frustrated, angry, and embarrassed appearance very amusing. He immediately leaped away and traveled through the night. The day after he left, no one knew of the Black-Faced Bat King's death. Wang Long and Ji Hui from Jingchun Mountain were still searching, feeling very puzzled.

With everyone working together to search the mountain, they should have found some clues. A few days ago, they could still hear of sightings of the Black-Faced Bat King at night, but yesterday, all traces had vanished.

Wang Long and Ji Hui felt more and more urgent, worried that the Black-Faced Bat King had already broken out of the encirclement and would be difficult to find. The Essence Treasure had flown away, which was a pity. The Black-Faced Bat King was not weak in strength, and being hated by such a thief was extremely serious.

But upon closer consideration, it didn't seem right. They held the map, had a tight defense, and many people. Moreover, the Black-Faced Bat King feared the scorching sun, which was a great constraint. How could he have escaped repeatedly?

So... while anxiously searching, they waited in frustration. Luo Feiyan's hair was disheveled, and her clothes were torn. Unable to undo this "Silken Garment," she felt the Tiger Sinew Rope's power more and more.

It locked her sinews and bones, fixing her shape. She endured苦苦 (kǔkǔ - bitterly/enduring hardship). If it weren't for the internal Qi in her body, which moved the blood and Qi, she would have already suffered from blood stagnation and injury. Li Xian had already left gracefully and freely, while she was enduring torment.

So...

Two more days passed.

The elders of the Luo family convened a clan meeting. After several days without any news of the Black-Faced Bat King, they felt there was no more hope.

During this time, the Luo family elders had also been searching secretly. The Essence Treasure was of great importance, and they needed to make arrangements from many sides.

An elder of the Luo family, Luo Xiangxiang, was about to go out when she suddenly saw a person dressed as an inn attendant hesitating at the door, holding an envelope.

Luo Xiangxiang was a female elder. Any female member of the Luo family who reached the second realm of martial arts would never be married off. The outstanding ones, with high status and solid reputation and strength in the clan, would be elected as "clan elders."

"Clan elder" does not refer to seniority. If a family wants to continue its lineage, its rules must be perfect. Juniors must treat elders with courtesy and propriety, needing "respect"... but not necessarily "reverence." Only with both high strength and seniority can one be both respected and revered.

Luo Xiangxiang had once been famous, and her charm still lingered. She said, "What are you sneaking around for!" The inn attendant trembled, explained the situation, and handed over the letter.

Luo Xiangxiang took the letter and waved her hand dismissively, signaling for him to leave. She opened the letter and was instantly shaken to the core after just one glance. She closed the letter... took a few steps to catch up, grabbed the inn attendant's shoulder, and said coldly, "Where is the inn? Take me there quickly."

Her eyes flashed with a cold light, feeling extremely excited. If she could slay the Black-Faced Bat King, she would have rendered another great service, and her status in the clan would rise even higher. Having received the news, she needed to investigate the situation as soon as possible.

She found the inn attendant too slow, so she grabbed his collar and activated her lightness technique to rush there. They soon arrived at the inn, and she had already asked about the situation on the way. She immediately sneaked into the guest room.

But where was the Black-Faced Bat King? She only saw the Golden Hairpin of Xiu City, bound and in a sorry state on the bed. Luo Feiyan saw this scene, her face burning red, wishing she could find a hole to hide in.

*“My reputation is ruined!”* she cried in her heart. Luo Xiangxiang's expression was strange. First, she searched the room thoroughly, but found no trace at all. Only then did she approach.

Luo Xiangxiang said, "Feiyan, why are you here? What on earth happened?" She saw Luo Feiyan's posture, and her pretty face couldn't help but flush. But she quickly concealed it.

Luo Feiyan made "呜呜" sounds, unable to speak. Luo Xiangxiang was stunned, pinched her jaw, and used her Qi to guide it. Several numbing walnuts fell out one by one, stained with saliva and dampening the bedding. Luo Feiyan felt even more ashamed and hurriedly said, "Aunt Xiang... I... I was tricked by a villain."

Luo Xiangxiang saw her torn clothes and her expression changed: "Could it be that..." Luo Feiyan quickly said, "It... it wasn't that." Luo Xiangxiang said, "Really?"

Luo Feiyan said with a blushing face, "Aunt Xiang... you can check if you want." She was eager to prove her innocence. Luo Xiangxiang said, "Alright, I believe you. I received a letter today saying the Black-Faced Bat King was here, but I didn't see him. Instead, I saw you tied up. Could it be the work of the Black-Faced Bat King?"

Luo Feiyan said proudly, "The Black-Faced Bat King? Hmph, that guy was killed by me long ago. Does he have the ability to tie me up?"

Luo Xiangxiang had always known Luo Feiyan was proud. She admired this junior very much, but seeing her in such a miserable state herself, yet her words still full of pride, she suddenly felt that she deserved this calamity.

Luo Xiangxiang asked, "You killed the Black-Faced Bat King, did you search his body?" Luo Feiyan said, "I was about to, but... but I was harmed by a villain!"

Luo Xiangxiang said, "Did you see the Essence Treasure, the Yellow Nine Ginseng?" Luo Feiyan was stunned, "What Yellow Nine Ginseng?"

Luo Xiangxiang said, "Our Luo family went to great lengths to kill the Black-Faced Bat King. Do you think it was for fun? It was all for the Human Yellow Essence Treasure!"

"Ah!" Luo Feiyan said, "I... I didn't know. No wonder... no wonder that guy did this to me!"

Luo Xiangxiang said, "Sigh! It's also our elders' fault. After several discussions, we feared you juniors would leak the secret, so we didn't tell you. We only asked you to report immediately if you found any clues about the Black-Faced Bat King. We never thought... that this would... allow a villain to take advantage."

The two women communicated in detail and figured out the situation. Luo Feiyan said angrily, "So that Hua Manlou disguised himself for the Human Yellow."

Luo Xiangxiang drew her sword and cut through the Tiger Sinew Rope. Luo Feiyan felt deep regret and loss. Luo Xiangxiang saw that Luo Feiyan was a rare prodigy in the clan. She could endure setbacks, but she couldn't lose her spirit. Luo Xiangxiang said, "Feiyan, although you were careless in this matter... it's not right to blame yourself for all the fault."

"They say, knowing shame leads to courage. You are about to enter the Yueshan Sword Sect for intensive training. You can't be dispirited now."

Luo Feiyan said, "Alright! I will keep the matter of the Yueshan Sword Sect in mind and prepare well."

By the time the Luo family figured things out, Li Xian had already fled far away.

The vast sea of people served as his shield.

Li Xian prepared to consume the "Yellow Nine Ginseng." The method for consuming the Yellow Nine Ginseng: rise at the hour of Mao (5-7 a.m.), and light a candle.

For every three *hao* (a tiny unit of measurement) the candle burns down, drink one strand of ginseng fluff. During this process, one cannot move from the spot, nor can one touch the light outside the candle's halo. Wait until the candle burns out, and the consumption is complete.

*“The ninety-nine Yellow Nine Ginseng of Human Yellow... the Golden Light technique, enter my bosom.”*
