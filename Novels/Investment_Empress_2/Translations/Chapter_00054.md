# Chapter 54: One-Hit Kill, Did I Underestimate Myself?

Nijiao Alley.

Cui Peng leaned against a crooked tree, waiting for something.

"Kill Li Mo, stain myself with the blood of a genius, and my Blood Blade will rise to another level."

"I wonder if, besides the Murong family, he has any other experts by his side..."

As he muttered to himself.

A yellow-furred mouse crawled up from his pant leg to his shoulder.

After a few squeaks, a sinister arc appeared at the corner of his mouth.

That little beggar had successfully left a scent on the target.

With that, he could use the strange mouse as a spy to thoroughly investigate all information about the opponent.

Including the martial arts he was skilled in, whether he had a master following him, and his daily habits.

"When you understand a person completely, you can kill them easily."

Cui Peng gently stroked the Blood Blade under his robe, his heart burning with passion.

*Step—*

Footsteps sounded not far away.

Cui Peng looked up; it was the little beggar he had sent.

Since the goal was accomplished.

Then this little beggar had no need to live.

"Come here for the money."

Cui Peng took out another string of copper coins from his pocket and shook it.

His other hand had already grasped the Blood Blade.

But before he could make a move.

The yellow-furred mouse lay by his ear and squeaked twice again.

His heart pounded, and he turned his head sharply.

He saw that不知何时 (who knows when), a少年 (youth) wearing a cloud-patterned brocade robe had already stood there, his smile gentle.

"Cui Peng, you look nothing like your portrait," Li Mo said unhurriedly.

He hadn't expected it.

Originally, he was helping the Ice Cube find someone, but he got an unexpected gain.

Before the Murong family could give him news, Cui Peng had already bumped into his hands.

"How did you know?" Cui Peng's voice was like a阴风 (yin wind)刮出 (blowing) from the Nine Nether Hells.

His entire spirit was tense to the extreme.

Understanding the enemy made him feel like a hunter, confident that he had the situation under control.

But now.

The opponent had suddenly found him.

Who is the prey and who is the hunter, it's hard to say.

"There are many things in this world you don't know," Li Mo shook his head.

In the Eyes of Fate, the opponent's information appeared:

[Name: Cui Peng]
[Age: 28]
[Bone Structure: White Ape Arm.]
[Realm: Internal Qi Condensation Realm.]
[Fate: Green with a hint of Grey.]
[Evaluation: A cold-blooded, merciless swordsman with excellent luck, a born assassin.]
[Recent Encounter: Blood Blade Technique has reached a bottleneck, injuries have not yet healed, has no way out, preparing to take a risk, attempting to ambush and kill Clear Abyss Sect's true disciple Li Mo, and use this battle achievement to join the Drizzle Pavilion.]

Cui Peng stared fixedly at Li Mo.

A pale red short blade with a bloody scent had already fallen into his palm.

In the alley, the atmosphere solidified, filled with killing intent.

The little beggar was already scared silly; his young mind went blank, and the rice bag in his hand fell to the ground with a *pa-da*.

"You go first," Li Mo walked to his side and patted his head.

"Th... Thank you..." The little beggar left in a panic, stumbling and falling to the ground several times due to weak legs.

When he reached the alley entrance, he looked back one last time.

Although he didn't understand what had happened.

He vaguely knew that the benefactor from the Clear Abyss Sect, Li, was a good person, while the beggar who paid him to do things was a bad person.

Cui Peng!

That was the madman who had caused a life-or-death incident not long ago!

*Pa-da—*

In his panic, he stepped on a branch.

This instantly snapped the tension in the alley.

"Stop acting mysterious."

"Daring to come find me alone, today is your death day!" Cui Peng's eyes turned dangerous with gloom.

The Blood Blade in his palm appeared,划出 (drawing) a凄厉 (miserable) arc, stabbing towards Li Mo's chest.

The blade edge hissed, carrying...

The sharpness of weapon slaughter?

It seemed to be mixed with a trace of blood?

Li Mo's expression was strange.

---

It was certain that Cui Peng didn't hold back.

For him, a desperate struggle to finish the fight quickly was the best choice.

But isn't this just perfect...

"You kill people just to practice such a sword technique?" Li Mo shook his head.

He originally wanted to test his hammer skills, but now it seems there is no need.

The Chixiao Sword at his waist fell into his palm.

*Ding, ding, ding—*

In the blink of an eye.

Chixiao directly shattered the internal energy包裹 (wrapped) around the blade, colliding with the Blood Blade several times.

Under Cui Peng's disbelieving gaze, the Blood Blade, which was close to a famous weapon, actually cracked one by one.

Cui Peng's eyes were about to split.

However, before he could feel heartache.

At the place where the weapons just collided, explosive force suddenly erupted.

*Crack—*

The Blood Blade shattered.

What rushed back was an even more violent sharpness of weapon slaughter,炸废 (exploding and ruining) his entire arm.

"You... you also know the Blood Blade Technique?" Cui Peng's heart掀起 (lifted) a stormy sea.

"What nonsense?" *Pfft—*

Blood flowers splashed, flowing down the Chixiao Sword.

Cui Peng died very peacefully.

"Even a full-powered Internal Qi Condensation Realm expert definitely isn't my opponent."

Li Mo was actually quite surprised.

He is this strong now?

He had only used a 'regular sword strike' just now, yet he directly killed someone from a higher level.

But thinking about it, it makes sense.

Although he is at the Qi and Blood Realm, he has already exceeded the limit of the Twelve Meridians.

Extreme Weapon Killing Body,出手 (出手)自带 (carries) the sharpness of weapon slaughter, able to easily break through the 'Qi' of the Internal Qi Condensation Realm.

He is also holding a Mystic Weapon.

These are conditions that ordinary people cannot reach, allowing him to complete the 'feat' of 'one-hit kill across levels'.

"I originally hoped Cui Peng could let me hone my actual combat skills," Li Mo shook his head,扫过 (scanned) the other party's corpse, and searched through his clothes.

Ahem, this is purely because Little Li played too many games in his past life and has a habit of looting after killing monsters.

"Silver tickets... Blood Blade Technique... Strong Bone Pills..."

Most of the things on the other party, he didn't look at favorably.

The Blood Blade Technique that Cui Peng valued like his life was merely a mid-tier martial art.

Silver tickets and pills, he wasn't lacking any.

"This is..." Li Mo suddenly touched a hard, sharp object.

After pulling it out, it was actually an iron swallow.

The material wasn't strange, just the most ordinary mortal iron, but the silver-hooked iron brush writing on it透着 (exuded) a strange sharpness.

It wrote:

[The swallows that used to be in front of the halls of the nobles have flown into the homes of common people.]

"The Drizzle Pavilion's Hall Front Swallow," Li Mo recognized this item.

He had also heard the beautiful master mention it casually.

The Drizzle Pavilion is the most infamous organization among the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths.

Even its entry ceremony is very inhumane.

To join the Drizzle Pavilion, it's not that you go to sign up, but they come to find you.

An iron swallow represents that they have already found you.

Whether you are willing or not, you must participate in the 'Infernal Trial'.

The so-called Infernal Trial is to designate an area and let the selected people kill each other.

Only the few who survive until the end can enter the pavilion.

"The Drizzle Pavilion's Infernal Trial is about to start in Ziyang Prefecture?" Li Mo wasn't interested in this kind of organization.

He might as well wait for the yamen runners to arrive and send Cui Peng's body to the sect together for the elders to consider.

Just at this moment.

"It's right ahead!" The little beggar's voice sounded.

Along with him were the grandfather and grandson, Murong Hai and Murong Xiao.

Murong Xiao heard that there was no movement here and became a bit anxious.

"It's fine, Young Li is safe," Murong Hai was a Viewing God Realm expert with powerful perception.

He could sense that in Nijiao Alley, there was only Li Mo's aura, and it was quite stable.

He thought, perhaps Cui Peng had fled...

Before the thought could finish.

He saw the youth standing in front of a corpse, playing with the iron swallow in his hand.
