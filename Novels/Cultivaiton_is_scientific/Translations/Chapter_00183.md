# Chapter 183: The Ancient Abode  

The drone flew through the hall, and Li Shiming expected to see a room ahead. Instead, what appeared before him was a garden.  

The garden wasn’t particularly large, spanning only a few hundred square meters. A pond had been dug in its center, where several lotus flowers bloomed atop the water. The lotuses shimmered with spiritual light, as did the pond itself—all of them were spiritual treasures.  

The ground of the garden was dotted with various spiritual plants, though their untended state made them appear rather chaotic. Above, artificial sunlight, created by a formation, bathed the plants and pond in its glow.  

This was a garden built within a cave abode. Li Shiming had never seen the dwelling of a high-ranking Northern Shu cultivator before, and now he was finally witnessing one firsthand.  

At the far end of the garden, several rooms had been carved out. The drone scouted them and found that only one was accessible—the others were blocked by shimmering light barriers.  

The deeper Li Shiming looked, the more hesitant he became. From the magical treasures in the hall to the spiritual plants in the garden, and now the single accessible room, everything seemed designed to lure intruders further inside.  

He placed a signal relay at the entrance of the ancient abode and, together with Li Yuanba, began retreating step by step. Every so often, he left another relay behind, ensuring he could maintain control over the drone from a distance.  

After retreating a full ten li, he set up a formation to conceal his presence before finally commanding the drone to enter the accessible room.  

As the drone passed through, the camera feed revealed a withered figure seated cross-legged on a meditation cushion, resembling a corpse. The figure had snow-white hair and wrinkled skin, with an ancient black zither placed before it.  

Li Shiming switched the drone to infrared thermal imaging. The withered body didn’t emit the normal human temperature of 37 degrees, but it was warmer than a corpse should be. If it had truly been dead for years, its temperature would have matched the surroundings. The discrepancy could only mean one thing—this wasn’t a corpse, but a living cultivator.  

At this moment, the Six-Fingered Sound Demon was also frustrated. After all these years, he had finally welcomed a visitor.  

Using the methods he had left behind, only someone who could play the "Earth Tone Annihilation Melody" on the "Earth Tone Annihilation Zither" and survive its effects without death or madness would possess the mental fortitude he sought.  

This was his way of screening for a suitable inheritor.  

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon had suffered severe injuries and, in his desperation, attempted to cultivate recklessly. This led to a qi deviation—a common risk of demonic cultivation techniques.  

Demonic cultivation allowed rapid progress, but its foundation was far less stable than orthodox Daoist or Buddhist methods. Moreover, demonic cultivation neglected mental refinement, increasing the likelihood of qi deviation.  

Already grievously wounded and unable to move, the Six-Fingered Sound Demon could only rely on his divine sense. For years, he had clung to life, waiting for the right cultivator to arrive—someone he could possess to regain a new body.  

He didn’t need exceptional talent, only extraordinary mental strength, as that was the foundation for inheriting his legacy.  

The "Earth Tone Annihilation Zither" had changed hands many times in the cultivation world. Some cultivators had refined it, but not all could receive the "Earth Tone Annihilation Melody" score. Only those with sufficient mental strength could perceive it—the first layer of his screening.  

Without the melody, the zither was weaker than an ordinary sound-based magical tool, which led to its frequent exchanges.  

Among those who obtained it, some had the required mental strength. However, upon refining the zither and receiving the melody, they perished, unable to withstand its power.  

Since the zither was only a spirit artifact, it never attracted the attention of Golden Core cultivators. Thus, it passed through many hands, leaving countless dead in its wake.  

Eventually, it ended up in the hands of Yi Lingling at an auction and was later acquired by Li Shiming.  

After waiting so long, the Six-Fingered Sound Demon was dismayed to find that his visitor wasn’t a cultivator but a strange flying contraption.  

He refrained from using his divine sense actively, merely observing the drone.  

Li Shiming, in turn, studied the withered figure. The drone scanned the body thoroughly before focusing on the ring on its finger.  

He had seen similar rings before—space rings, storage devices reserved for powerful Golden Core cultivators, essentially artifacts of the highest grade.  

Li Shiming considered the situation. If the Six-Fingered Sound Demon could move freely, why had he remained secluded for centuries?  

This deduction came from analyzing the formation outside. The traces of spiritual energy within it revealed its age—an ability only an advanced formation master possessed.  

Since the demon was alive yet unwilling to leave, and had used the zither to lure cultivators, there had to be a reason.  

Almost immediately, Li Shiming thought of possession.  

He had nearly fallen victim to a Golden Core sword cultivator’s possession attempt before, leaving a deep impression of how dangerous such beings could be.  

To confirm whether the demon was truly immobile, he needed to provoke a reaction—and verify if it was alive.  

With that in mind, Li Shiming directed the drone toward the figure’s hand. Its mechanical arm extended toward the space ring, as if attempting to pry it loose.  

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon could no longer feign death. His life’s accumulation and legacy were in that ring.  

His divine sense brushed against the zither, causing one of its strings to vibrate and emit a low hum.  

The drone exploded instantly. As it disintegrated, a small amount of embedded explosive detonated.  

The explosion wasn’t meant to harm the demon—even a hundred times the amount wouldn’t have been enough. Instead, it was designed to destroy an unstable fifty-cubic-meter storage bag attached beneath the drone.  

This was Li Shiming’s "gift" for the possibly immobile demon—a meticulously prepared trap.  

The explosion destabilized the already damaged storage bag, causing its contents to spill out.  

A flood of specially formulated concrete, labeled C130, poured from the void, burying the Six-Fingered Sound Demon, the zither, and the entire room.  

This C130 concrete was a byproduct of Li Shiming’s attempts to recreate his past life’s technology. By grinding the water-repellent rock of this world into powder and mixing it into the concrete, he had created a variant that hardened rapidly upon contact with air.  

The sudden deluge of concrete caught the demon off guard. He attempted to repel it with his divine sense, but the entire room was quickly filled. The concrete solidified at the doorway, sealing the room shut.  

Though fifty cubic meters wasn’t enough to fill the entire space, it was more than sufficient to engulf the demon.  

His divine sense struggled to push back, but the concrete simply flowed around his efforts, soon submerging him completely.  

He tried to activate the zither, but it too was buried, leaving no space for sound to resonate.  

The outer layers of concrete hardened upon contact with air, but the inner portions remained semi-fluid.  

The demon’s divine sense could scatter the concrete easily, but doing so only mixed it further, making no difference.  

After centuries of clinging to life, his divine sense was already weakened. After a brief struggle, exhaustion set in.  

Even as a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, surviving for centuries in such a state was a testament to his strength.  

Now, he abandoned resistance, conserving his energy for one final strike against the cultivator who had trapped him.  

Days passed—one, two, three—but Li Shiming never appeared. The concrete fully solidified, reaching a hardness surpassing granite, capable of withstanding immense pressure.  

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon was now entombed, deprived of air.  

Li Shiming sent another drone into the abode. It navigated to the garden and hovered outside the sealed room.  

The concrete barrier made it impossible to see inside, but the scene within was easy to imagine.  

He knew cultivators could survive without air—even he could sustain himself with spiritual energy for a time. A Golden Core cultivator could likely endure for decades.  

But confirming the demon’s entrapment was enough. It was time for the next step.  

"Stay here, fellow Daoist," Li Shiming said to Li Yuanba as he returned to the abode’s entrance.  

Though it would have been safer to send Li Yuanba inside, the next phase required his own presence.  

Li Yuanba sat cross-legged at the entrance while Li Shiming ventured inside.  

He reached the hall but didn’t touch anything. Instead, he paced back and forth, studying the surroundings.  

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon sensed his arrival. Though trapped, his resentment burned fiercely.  

Even at his lowest, hunted by the Netherworld Sect, he had never suffered such humiliation—being trapped by a mere early Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Once the cultivator came closer, he would seize him with his divine sense.  

The demon had deliberately conserved his strength for this moment.  

Li Shiming’s spiritual sense swept through the hall repeatedly. Inside his Mind Palace, the IBM Z15’s 190 CPUs worked in unison, analyzing the formation’s energy lines.  

This formation was unlike any he had encountered, surpassing his current understanding.  

But formations followed fundamental principles. With the Z15’s computational power, he only needed sufficient data.  

Proceeding cautiously, he extended his spiritual sense into the garden, gathering more information.  

Within his mental sea of formations, new stars of knowledge emerged—each brighter than the last, representing deeper insights.  

This was his longest analysis yet. For ten days, he and the Z15 worked tirelessly, gradually constructing a rough blueprint of the formation.  

"Found it!" Li Shiming exclaimed with joy.  

A complete analysis would take much longer, but he didn’t need full control—just the location of the formation’s energy nodes.  

A formation sustaining itself for centuries required a spirit vein.  

His analysis pinpointed its location—beneath the garden’s pond.  

Over the next five days, he modified the formation, redirecting the spirit vein’s energy into the hall.  

He repurposed the formation to divert all spiritual energy from other areas into the hall, causing the rest of the formation to collapse.  

Without the spirit vein’s support, the abode’s environment deteriorated. Polluted air seeped in, killing most of the garden’s spiritual plants.  

Li Shiming ignored the loss—though many were second-grade plants, survival took precedence.  

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon endured, but his hope dwindled. Without spiritual energy, his already depleted body couldn’t last long. The lack of air forced him to expend precious energy just to stay alive.  

Meanwhile, the cunning cultivator showed no urgency, calmly cultivating in the hall as if it were his own abode.  

Li Shiming wasn’t worried. The demon’s strength had clearly waned. With his body immobilized, how much power could his divine sense truly wield?
