## Chapter 92: The Patriarch of Fire Spirit Sect

The moment they clashed, Qin Yan was sent flying, but she had anticipated her opponent's strength and had set up multiple layers of defense, which prevented her from getting injured.

Though she managed to escape unscathed, Qin Yan's faint hopes of victory were dashed. She realized that a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage was far beyond her league.

Despite being a woman, Qin Yan was decisive and quickly released all her offensive talismans. A burst of dazzling light and thunderous sounds filled the air as she activated her last lifesaving talisman.

She was teleported away once more.

Unlike the teleportation array, the teleportation talisman's destination was random and limited in distance. After reappearing, Qin Yan didn't dare to linger and immediately flew away on her cloud-like vessel, hoping to escape as far as possible.

However, halfway through her escape, she encountered the young cultivator with astonishing abilities. Lin Xuan was still wearing the attire of the Fire Spirit Sect. Without hesitation, Qin Yan launched a deadly attack.

The two exchanged blows, and initially, neither gained the upper hand. It wasn't until they paused to assess each other that they realized they were familiar.

"Lin Xuan?" Qin Yan's face was filled with surprise as she gazed at the young man.

Lin Xuan's expression turned gloomy upon being recognized. He hadn't expected that his opponent would be a fellow sect member, someone he hadn't interacted with much due to their different statuses within the sect.

Qin Yan was equally astonished. She remembered Lin Xuan because they had once met in the Trial by Fire Path, though at that time, Lin Xuan's cultivation was much lower, and he hadn't noticed her. What struck her was Lin Xuan's determination and perseverance, qualities that made her take notice.

However, her memories of Lin Xuan were of a cultivator at the early Spirit Sensitivity stage, not someone who could fly using a magical instrument. She was puzzled by his sudden advancement.

Lin Xuan's eyes flickered with surprise, but he quickly regained his composure. "Qin Senior Sister, what's going on?" he asked, his priority being to understand the danger she faced.

Before Qin Yan could respond, a yellow fog appeared in the distance, swirling with intense spiritual energy. Lin Xuan's expression turned grim as he prepared for battle, grasping his flying sword and a talisman.

The fog coalesced into a figure - a man in his forties with a dignified demeanor, resembling a cultivated immortal. However, upon closer inspection, Lin Xuan's face fell. He recognized the man as the Patriarch of the Fire Spirit Sect, a cultivator at the late Foundation Establishment stage.

Lin Xuan was taken aback, having not expected Qin Yan's opponent to be someone of such high stature. He knew that facing a late Foundation Establishment stage cultivator was beyond his capabilities, and his initial thought was to flee.

However, he didn't act on his impulse, knowing that making a move would attract the Patriarch's attention, potentially worsening the situation. Instead, Lin Xuan calmly prepared his talismans and defensive spells, layering multiple protections upon himself.

Qin Yan noticed Lin Xuan's actions and glanced at him, intrigued by his preparations.

The Fire Spirit Sect Patriarch, Qing Ling Zhenren, smiled, his expression turning sinister. "Ah, another one. I'll send you both to the underworld together."

As he spoke, Lin Xuan launched the first attack, unleashing firebirds and a fire snake. Qin Yan soon joined the fray, her attacks adding to the chaos.

Despite their combined efforts, Qing Ling Zhenren's defenses held strong, his yellow light shield protecting him from their onslaught. Lin Xuan's eyes narrowed; he knew that a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator's defenses were not to be underestimated.

Qing Ling Zhenren was equally surprised by the sheer number of talismans and the quality of Lin Xuan's magical instruments, including an upper-grade flying sword. He wondered about Lin Xuan's background, unable to place him among the lower-tier cultivators of Yan Province.

As the battle raged on, Lin Xuan felt his spiritual energy draining rapidly, a sign that he was no match for Qing Ling Zhenren's might. Qin Yan's timely intervention alleviated the pressure slightly, allowing Lin Xuan to catch his breath and continue fighting.

The introduction of the Hundred Souls Banner, a magical item with dark origins, caught Qing Ling Zhenren off guard. He recognized the banner as a demonic artifact, a tool of the devil cultivators. Though wary, Qing Ling Zhenren was confident in his abilities, having cultivated to the late Foundation Establishment stage.

However, unbeknownst to Lin Xuan and Qin Yan, Qing Ling Zhenren was currently weakened, his strength reduced to a third of its normal capacity due to injuries sustained from a mishap during his cultivation. This vulnerability made him cautious, especially when facing cultivators wielding demonic artifacts.

With a flick of his sleeve, Qing Ling Zhenren countered their attacks, his hands forming a complex seal as he prepared a countermeasure.
