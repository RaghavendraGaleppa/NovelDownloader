# Chapter 56: The Supreme One's Promise

"Indeed, it's True Adamant Spirit Energy!" Jianyuanzi nodded.

"What if he cultivated True Adamant Spirit Energy? It's not as if none of our disciples have comprehended the True Adamant Divine Art before. Does this qualify him for a Spirit Cleansing Pill?" True Monarch Changye shook his head.

"No, wait. Nephew Yang only joined the sect a month ago, and he's already cultivated True Adamant Spirit Energy and broken through to Foundation Establishment?" True Monarch Linggu suddenly paused, looking at Jianyuanzi's faint smile. He instantly understood why his Senior Brother was so confident in calling this meeting to contend for a Spirit Cleansing Pill.

"A month? Isn't that the same time as the outer sect disciples' entry? Linggu, didn't you say several years ago that Nephew Yang comprehended the Severing Sword Dao from the Sword Dao Projection? And at that meeting several years ago, you also mentioned the treatment of a Quasi-Nascent Soul True Monarch for him, which we all readily agreed to. Did you not lead Nephew Yang into the sect several years ago?" True Monarch Guanxiao asked blankly.

True Monarch Linggu let out a dry cough and then spoke of the assessment.

"You mean you assessed Nephew Yang for three years, and he only joined the sect a month ago? And during this time, he comprehended the True Adamant Divine Art and cultivated True Adamant Spirit Energy? In just one month?" True Monarch Sheng Yu asked in shock.

"No, one month is the time it took him from comprehending the cultivation technique to breaking through to Foundation Establishment. This means the time he spent comprehending the technique was far less than a month." True Monarch Yongen's expression was deeply moved. He stared at Yang Ji repeatedly, exclaiming, "A genius! Nephew Yang's comprehension is truly rare."

"If comprehending the Severing Sword Dao from the Sword Dao Projection was luck, then comprehending the True Adamant Divine Art in such a short time this time is extraordinary comprehension."

"With such comprehension, he is certainly qualified to receive a Spirit Cleansing Pill."

"Furthermore, I propose raising Nephew Yang's treatment standard from Quasi-Nascent Soul True Monarch to Nascent Soul True Monarch."

"No, raise his standard to Spirit Transformation." The White-Browed Supreme One suddenly spoke.

"Raise it to Spirit Transformation? Supreme One, isn't that too much?" Everyone exchanged glances, somewhat surprised by the Supreme One's decision.

"Too much? Not at all." The White-Browed Supreme One shook his head and said, "Back then, when I comprehended this cultivation technique, it took me a full year just to get started. Changxiao and Little Ji's entry time should be roughly the same, both within a month. From this, you can see the gap in comprehension between me and them."

"Do you know what this means?"

"The sect will greatly prosper!"

Hearing these four words, everyone's hearts trembled. Indeed, only with comparison comes true shock.

"With Changxiao's talent, there's an 80% chance he'll forever remain within the Dao Sect. Little Ji's comprehension is not bad; what he lacks is his Root Bone. However, Root Bones can be improved with spiritual treasures, but comprehension cannot."

"If Little Ji has abundant cultivation resources and can raise his cultivation to Spirit Transformation, then with his comprehension, he will have a 50% chance of successfully comprehending the Dao and entering Void Refinement."

"Void Refinement and Dao comprehension – that is what truly makes a powerful cultivator, even within the Dao Sect."

"If both Little Ji and Changxiao can achieve Void Refinement, how can our Canglan Sect not greatly prosper? When the Dao Sect bestows endless elixirs and magic treasures upon us, why would you worry about not being able to overcome the Divine Tribulation and achieve Spirit Transformation?" The White-Browed Supreme One spoke, his body radiating a brilliant spiritual light, his face beaming.

Hearing this, everyone's breathing quickened slightly.

"Little Ji, I don't know much about you, and my understanding of your comprehension is limited to the Sword Dao Projection and the True Adamant Divine Art. If you can fully master all four forms of the Gui Zang Sword Art within one year and comprehend a sliver of Sword Intent, then I can promise to give you another Spirit Cleansing Pill. If you have two Spirit Cleansing Pills, you can definitely raise your Root Bone from low-grade to mid-grade."

"Taking both together will yield the best effect."

"You can take one now. If you're confident, you can take the other one in a year."

"If you truly succeed, I can then decide to elevate your status to that of a Quasi-Void Refinement Seed."

Hearing this, Jianyuanzi's expression brightened. Such a standard of treatment was almost on par with Li Changxiao's.

With the full power of the sect poured into him, and consuming the best elixirs, even with a low-grade Root Bone, his cultivation speed would still surge.

One must know, how many disciples with high-grade Root Bones couldn't obtain such benefits? Otherwise, those two Spirit Cleansing Pills would have been gone long ago.

Because in recent years, besides Li Changxiao, the sect truly hadn't produced a genius with such outstanding comprehension. Only such geniuses could bring them hope.

"Since Grandmaster trusts me, there is no reason for this disciple to shrink back. In one year, I shall take both Spirit Cleansing Pills," Yang Ji said, raising his head, his voice full of vigor.

"Good!" The White-Browed Supreme One smiled in satisfaction, then looked towards Jianyuanzi. "Jianyuan, you truly have immense fortune and luck, encountering two such outstanding disciples, Changxiao and Little Ji, one after another. How about letting you be the next Sect Master? It would also boost our sect's luck."

True Monarch Mingcheng immediately called out, "I agree with this proposal!"

Jianyuanzi glanced at him, but shook his head, chuckling, "We all agreed, whoever loses becomes the Sect Master. There's no way I'd be Sect Master. The position of Sect Master is better suited for Senior Brother Mingcheng. I'm used to being carefree; I can't manage the sect well."

Hearing this, True Monarch Mingcheng's face was filled with helplessness.

"By the way, Grandmaster, I have something else," Yang Ji suddenly said.

"What is it, Little Ji? Tell us." The White-Browed Supreme One looked over.

Yang Ji immediately flipped his hand, conjuring two wisps of spiritual energy, and said, "Grandmaster and Senior Uncles, please take a look at these two wisps of spiritual energy. What's different about them?"

"What's different?" Everyone looked over, curious for a moment.

For a moment, no one could tell anything. True Monarch Guanxiao cast a sideways glance and said, "Junior Brother Yongen, didn't you cultivate the True Adamant Divine Art before? Can you tell the difference between these two wisps of spiritual energy?"

"Why do I feel like both wisps are True Adamant Spirit Energy? As for a difference? The wisp on the left has a faint blue tint, while the wisp on the right is like the spiritual energy I condensed when I cultivated the True Adamant Divine Art before—both are translucent and colorless." True Monarch Yongen said, concentrating.

"Indeed, both wisps seem to be True Adamant Spirit Energy. It's just that one has a faint aqua blue color, and the other doesn't. The latter wisp is the same as the spiritual energy Changxiao cultivated." The White-Browed Supreme One narrowed his eyes slightly and asked, "Little Ji, is there some mystery here?"

"Grandmaster and Senior Uncles, please observe!" Yang Ji shot out the two wisps of spiritual energy from his hand. One wisp left a white mark on a flying sword before shattering into pieces, while the other wisp also left a white mark but then bounced back undamaged.

"This?" Everyone present was a master, instantly discerning the difference between the two wisps of spiritual energy.

"Little Ji, how did you cultivate this aqua-blue True Adamant Spirit Energy in your hand?" The White-Browed Supreme One immediately asked.

"This disciple accidentally merged them while transforming spiritual energy. It contains two types of spiritual energy: Spirit Water Energy cultivated from the Spirit Water Art, and True Adamant Spirit Energy cultivated from the True Adamant Divine Art. The two energies merged, and their properties perfectly fused."

"Senior Brother Changxiao also cultivates the True Adamant Divine Art. If he could incorporate some Spirit Water Energy, the True Adamant Spirit Energy within his body might change, and his strength would correspondingly increase quite a bit," Yang Ji explained.

"This is truly a great surprise. Little Ji, you've really helped Changxiao immensely, and by extension, you've greatly helped the sect." The White-Browed Supreme One stroked his beard and chuckled.

A hint of a smile also appeared on Yang Ji's face. "This is what a disciple should do."

At this moment, the White-Browed Supreme One found Yang Ji more and more pleasing to the eye, instantly having the thought of taking him as a disciple again.

Jianyuanzi, seeing the Supreme One's eyes practically sparkling, immediately gave a few dry coughs and ended the meeting, citing Yang Ji's need for cultivation.

With the meeting concluded, the Nascent Soul True Monarchs returned to their respective peaks.

On Longdao Peak, True Monarch Changye was currently seated comfortably in a large chair, leisurely sipping spiritual tea, seemingly in a very good mood.

The middle-aged man beside him curiously asked, "Father, what was discussed at today's meeting that has put you in such a good mood?"

"Our Canglan Sect has another genius! Truly, the heavens bless Canglan," True Monarch Changye chuckled.

"A genius? Is he as formidable as Junior Brother Changxiao?" The middle-aged man's eyes flickered slightly as he asked curiously.

"Look, it's him. His Root Bone is a bit inferior, but his comprehension is enough to rival Nephew Changxiao." True Monarch Changye swept his hand, and a spiritual light flashed in the air, instantly revealing a scene with a human figure.

"It's that kid?" The middle-aged man was greatly startled, his expression subtly changing.

"Hm? What's wrong? Do you know Nephew Yang?" Changye noticed his strange expression and couldn't help but glance at him.

"No, I don't know him. I'm just surprised by his youth. With geniuses appearing one after another in our Canglan Sect, it truly seems we're on the rise." The middle-aged man secretly swallowed, feeling a headache. He thought to himself, "Why is it this kid? I snatched his Beast Fire back then... no, that's not right, I changed my appearance back then, what am I afraid of?"

His expression immediately brightened.

True Monarch Changye saw his expression shifting back and forth, from worry to joy, and frowned, "You truly don't know him?"

"Father, I really don't know him. However, I do wish to get to know this Junior Brother and perhaps bask in some of his good fortune." The middle-aged man's eyes flickered, and he smiled meaningfully.

"Basking in good fortune isn't a bad idea. I'll introduce you another day, but for now, Nephew Yang's cultivation is paramount, and he must not be disturbed," True Monarch Changye said sternly.

"Yes, yes, I understand." The middle-aged man nodded in response, his expression relaxing.
