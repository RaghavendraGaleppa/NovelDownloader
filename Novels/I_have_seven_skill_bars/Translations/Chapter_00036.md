# Chapter 36: Self-Detonating True Essence

The remaining people could only continue hurrying on foot towards Spirit Field 377.

“This is way too inconvenient. Didn’t the sect consider something like this? The Spirit Field Zone is so vast, and it’s completely impractical to send reinforcements,” someone complained.

“Who would have thought that an evil cultivator was secretly lurking, having infiltrated the Spirit Field Zone? I still find it unbelievable.”

“Indeed, our Sect Alliance gathered together hundreds of years ago. Any outsiders wishing to enter would certainly need to be inspected by the elders of various sects. Our Profound Talisman Sect hasn’t had any outsiders join for three hundred years, right? How could an evil cultivator have sneaked into our Profound Talisman Sect?”

“That’s right, and the Spirit Field Zone is at the very heart of the sect, tightly surrounded by the four halls. It can almost be considered the safest place. The sect wouldn’t need to consider sending reinforcements to the Spirit Field Zone at all!”

“Where exactly did this evil cultivator come from?”

“Perhaps Brother Ma Xiu knows. We should ask him.”

...

The fierce battle at the entrance of Spirit Field 377 had raged continuously since its start. Even at the peak of Foundation Establishment, Mu Tian was utterly exhausted. While True Essence could be recovered, the consumption of Divine Sense during combat was inevitable. He now suffered from a splitting headache, barely able to circulate his True Essence to resist any longer.

But no matter how normal such a choice might seem, it was still gambling with years of cultivation accumulation and one's very life. This was especially true for cultivators within a sect, where every resource was hard-won. Thus, most of them would only use standard methods against enemies; self-detonating True Essence was considered a last resort. Evil cultivators, however, had no such reservations. They cultivated through slaughter, and to achieve greater destructive efficiency, they typically employed various True Essence-consuming techniques. For example, Yang Shou at this moment was continuously burning his True Essence to gain immense attacking power.

“To think I, Mu Tian, was protected by the sect elders for decades, never allowed to go out, and now I might just die within the sect... What the hell kind of messed up situation is this!” Mu Tian muttered, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth as he glanced towards the direction Ding Rui and Ma Wen had fled. Still, no one appeared. “It would be strange if they could appear from such a distance...” Mu Tian thought to himself, his gaze growing resolute. He had made up his mind to perish together with Yang Shou.

*Boom!*

Yang Shou's fist slammed over again, and Mu Tian raised his uninjured left arm to block. The violent True Essence belonging to the evil cultivator surged directly into Mu Tian's body. But this time, Mu Tian didn't retreat. Instead, he suddenly lunged forward, extending his bent left arm and fiercely striking Yang Shou's chest. His Divine Sense was utterly depleted, no longer able to support him in circulating True Essence outside his body, leaving him only this extremely risky close-quarters combat method. A peak Foundation Establishment cultivator like Mu Tian's attack was not easily parried either.

Mu Tian's palm was also in bad shape, a bloody mess with bones visible. A weapon held in hand always carried the potential to harm oneself; even the True Essence he cultivated was not truly his to begin with. Not to mention, the fighting style he was using was inherently self-destructive.

Mu Tian scrambled back to his feet, suddenly recalling something an elder once said: “Self-detonating True Essence is only scary the first time. If there's a first, there will be countless times.” The elder had continued, “Seeing those evil cultivators scatter in terror before you, blown apart – that kind of satisfaction is absolutely unimaginable to those who haven't self-detonated their True Essence. Moreover, no matter what realm one is in, self-detonating True Essence is one of the greatest killing moves of our generation of cultivators!”

“How true, hehe,” Mu Tian grinned, blood flowing again from his lips. His Divine Sense was on the verge of complete collapse. At most, he could circulate True Essence for a brief moment longer, then he would inevitably lose consciousness and faint. But he didn't want to faint. He planned to use this final opportunity to send the opposing Yang Shou to the great beyond as well. Since he couldn't survive, they would perish together! Mu Tian shook his head, which felt like it was about to explode, and cast one last glance in the direction Ding Rui had fled. Although he knew that at such a great distance, even if Ma Wen managed to run there, he would likely be too weak to run back, and it was even more impossible for others to arrive. Yet, abandoning hope was indeed a difficult thing to do.
