# Chapter 1: Qin Chong

The Song Kingdom, Yan Province.

The vast Cangyun Mountain Range stretched for thousands of miles, its depths filled with towering peaks, sheer cliffs, and countless perilous areas teeming with ferocious beasts and birds of prey. Ordinary mortals dared not venture into its heart.

Even the fringes of the mountain range posed extreme danger to common folk, though villagers and hunters living at the foothills occasionally braved the terrain—many never returned each year.

Xiao Cang Mountain formed part of the northern foothills of Cangyun Mountain. Though insignificant compared to the range's deeper regions, it stood as one of the larger peaks in the northern area.

Deep within Xiao Cang Mountain's dense forests, a sixteen-year-old youth sprinted toward the mountain's outer reaches.

Of average build with slightly tanned skin, the boy's youthful face bore eyes that seemed weathered by hardship—their gaze resolute, his expression grave.

This was Qin Chong, a third-level Qi Refining cultivator from the Qin Clan near Xiao Cang Mountain. Currently on a training expedition, he relied solely on his legs for movement, as cultivators below mid-Qi Refining couldn't yet wield flying swords.

Thirty yards behind Qin Chong, an iron-backed gray wolf gave relentless chase. This early first-tier demonic beast, common in Xiao Cang Mountain, measured over ten feet long. Its gray fur bore a distinctive black patch across the back. Thick-skinned and powerful, the creature's fangs, claws, and brute strength made it formidable—hence Qin Chong's desperate flight despite his cultivation level.

Though demonic beasts typically surpassed human cultivators of equivalent rank, their low intelligence made them ideal training opponents for novice practitioners.

As he fled, Qin Chong nursed resentment—not toward the wolf, but regarding his forced expedition. By clan rules, pre-mid-Qi Refining cultivators weren't required to undertake field training. Yet schemers had manipulated the clan leader into assigning him this mission over a month prior.

"Whoosh!"

A gust of wind signaled the wolf's leap. Before its massive frame crashed down, the stench of its breath forced Qin Chong to hold his nose. He dodged right, barely avoiding the pounce.

Stabilizing himself, Qin Chong summoned his lone inferior-grade magical weapon—the Flying Dragon Sword. The earthen-yellow blade's grandiose name far exceeded its actual power, as naming conventions reflected their wielders' preferences.

The wolf swatted away the yellow streak with a casual forepaw swipe before roaring at Qin Chong, baring fangs in a display of dominance.

"Arrogant beast! Even if I can't defeat you yet, do you truly think you can best me?" Qin Chong formed seals, recalling and relaunching his sword.

After hours of combat, he'd gauged his opponent—the wolf's defenses were impenetrable to his current strength, yet it couldn't overcome him either. This stalemate had persisted all day.

The wolf dodged the second strike with surprising agility, closing the distance before rearing up to deliver a skull-splitting slash. Qin Chong rolled clear, springing up to continue retreating while recalling his sword.

He knew brute force wouldn't prevail—only strategy could win this battle. With no immediate solution, he adopted delaying tactics, hoping to exhaust the beast. Yet after hours, the wolf showed no fatigue while his own spiritual energy neared depletion. Three more sword strikes would exhaust him completely.

The wolf roared pursuit as Qin Chong fled toward an unexpected dead end—the Flying Cloud Waterfall.

Converging mountain streams plunged dozens of yards down a cliff face into a deep pool below. With the precipice at his back and the wolf advancing, Qin Chong's mind raced through desperate options.

Noticing a wrist-thick tree growing from the cliffside yards away, he hatched a perilous plan—lure the wolf into attacking, then send it tumbling to its death while grabbing the tree to save himself. Yet low-tier demons weren't entirely foolish; the wolf halted at the cliff's edge, growling warily.

Rather than fear, Qin Chong felt defiance surge within him.

Humph! With memories from two lifetimes—including knowledge spanning five millennia of history and global wonders—if I can't outwit this beast today, I don't deserve to walk the immortal path!
