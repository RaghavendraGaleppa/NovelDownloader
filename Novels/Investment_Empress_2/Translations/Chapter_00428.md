# Chapter 428: Just Like Stir-Frying!

"What... kind of hammer technique is that?"

Elder Han He stared intently at the figure in the distance, unable to look away for a long time. He even suspected that he was seeing things.

That was the Anvil of the Ancestor, and the Hammer of the Ancestor.

After slumbering for countless ages, it had now, in the hands of a youth who had just passed seventeen, once again unleashed its original brilliance.

Why was it that he, who was only at the Divine Vision Realm, could accomplish what so many craftsmen of the Divine Weapon Peak had failed to do for thousands of years?

"The 'Divine Hammer Little Overlord's' Divine Hammer does not refer to that divine weapon."

Elder Zeng recalled the scene at the top of the Sword Tower and sighed.

"Rather, it is his hammer technique that has reached the divine realm."

"I... was a fool."

Elder Han He muttered to himself, finally understanding Xue Jing's feelings at that moment.

To master a hammer technique of the Divine Art level and be able to wield a divine weapon—regardless of how he achieved it—the Panjie Meteorite Hammer was indeed held lightly in his grasp as if it weighed nothing.

Furthermore, he was unafraid of extreme heat, thriving within the Fire Vein as if he were a fish in water.

Such a person, Elder Han He could not think of any reason why he would not become a Divine Craftsman in the future.

Not far away.

"The Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements... is showing signs of reaching the入门 level (initial mastery)?"

Li Mo looked puzzled as his movements slowly came to a stop, like a furnace whose fire had been extinguished.

It was just... suddenly bald.

He himself hadn't expected that his talent in the path of forging was no less than his talent in the hammer technique.

《Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements》was also a Divine Art.

But he had only wanted to test if he could use the Hammer Treasure to forge after augmenting himself with World Power, and this Divine Art was almost at the入门 level.要知道 (要知道), he hadn't even had time to strike the iron yet.

Just now, he had only struck the anvil.

At that moment, he turned his head and discovered the two old men looking at him with complex expressions.

"You two are awake? It seems the effect of the Seven-Striped Cold Spring Pill is quite good."

"???"

Elder Han He's scalp went numb, and he was sweating profusely even in the depths of the Fire Vein. No wonder he didn't feel the heat anymore; it turned out that what he had just eaten was a Seven-Striped Pill.

Elder Zeng's mouth twitched. "Do you know how heavy a mountain of gold is? A body at the External Scenery Realm would have a hard time moving it."

"How do you know?"

"At the time, Li Mo threw the mountain of gold on the empty ground and asked me to move it. It tired me out."

"......"

Elder Han He had never experienced such a sense of toil in his entire life.

"Alright, while the effect of the Seven-Striped Pill is still there..."

"I shall teach you our Clear Abyss Sect's secret weapon-forging method."

Elder Han He straightened his腰桿 (waist/back) as he spoke.

"Don't learn from that old fogey Han He."

Elder Zeng's eyes shone as he looked at Li Mo as if he were a rare treasure.

"The weapon-forging method of the Hengyun Sword City is more suitable for you. Besides, that old fogey Han He can at most forge sharp weapons, while I can forge Famous Weapons. I am a genuine Great Artisan."

Elder Han He was furious. "Old Dog Zeng, you've gone too far! He is a disciple of our Clear Abyss Sect! What do you mean by butting in?"

Elder Zeng remained unfazed. "I simply can't bear to see you mislead the youth. Moreover, Li Mo is Shang Wu's disciple, not yours."

"Hmph, a Great Artisan? A Great Artisan who only knows shortcuts? Even a scallion wouldn't want to dip itself in your kind of sauce!"

"Personal attack! You're making a personal attack! I challenge you to a duel!"

"Bring it on! Do you think I'm afraid of you?"

The two old men, like two bulls, butted heads and were on the verge of fighting.

They had always been at odds in their approach to the path of forging.

Elder Zeng was a reformist, advocating the use of all available technological means. He believed that forging didn't necessarily have to use a hammer; any method that could forge a good blade was a good forging method. The Gold and Stone Sword-Nourishing Array was one of his achievements.

He thought the other party was stubbornly attached to the past and inflexible.

Elder Han He, on the other hand, revered ancient methods. He believed that true blades should be forged meticulously, strike by strike, with heart and spirit poured into them, to have a chance of becoming a Divine Craftsman in the future.

He thought the other party was all about technology and ruthless tricks, completely不懂 (understanding) what it means to pour in one's soul!

---

"So, what is the main difference in their manifestations?"

Li Mo didn't quite understand this aspect and found it hard to choose for a moment.

Moreover, personally speaking...

Elder Han He went without saying; the Ancestor of Divine Weapons had given him the most precious treasures, so he was an elder with a stern exterior but a soft heart.

Elder Zeng... he had even put on a mask and recklessly fought to抢 (grab) a single hair for him.

"Let's take the simplest smelting step as an example. I'll demonstrate it for you!"

Elder Zeng took the initiative, taking out a large cauldron covered in array patterns from his spatial artifact. It was about the size of a field kettle.

He took out some of the most common iron ore and put it into the cauldron.

Then he placed the cauldron over the Fire Vein and activated the patterns on it.

Soon, under the influence of the patterns, the iron ore inside was roasted until red-hot.

Elder Zeng stood by the cauldron, occasionally pouring in a material that made Little Li feel dizzy just by smelling it—Black Evil Wood Oil.

That wasn't the end.

"This is Stone Fire Powder, it can purify impurities."

"And Gold Wind Rock, it makes the iron block more solid."

Like an alchemist, he poured many materials into it before finally forging it.

In no time, the steel was hammered into shape.

"So fast."

Li Mo blinked, not expecting forging to be so convenient.

"How is it?" Elder Zeng asked with a smile.

"Not impressive. That thing of yours has no craftsman's soul. It's just a crudely made object."

Elder Han He snorted coldly.

He took out ore to heat it, then placed it on the anvil, swinging his hammer to strike it with a special technique.

The hammer was like a sudden storm, continuous and pleasing to the eye.

While striking, he also reheated it, then repeatedly folded it, over and over.

"The Blue Steel Swords used by our Clear Abyss Sect disciples are all hundred-refined!"

"Every inch of them contains heart and effort!"

This time, it took much longer.

But the iron block that came out had layered patterns on it, very beautiful.

Then Elder Han He spent more effort to directly cast the iron into a sword and casually slashed it at the iron block forged by Elder Zeng, leaving a gap the size of a grain of rice in the latter.

Elder Zeng glared with wide eyes. "You damn bastard, you're劈 (chopping) my iron!"

The two old men started bickering again, then simultaneously looked at Li Mo:

"Which one do you think is better?"

"Wait a moment..."

Li Mo, who had been deep in thought, suddenly had a flash of inspiration in his mind.

Little Li's genius mind always had many ideas.

When he had been watching the two forging methods just now, an idea had already popped into his head.

"Both of your methods have their own merits. Why not merge them together?"

"Huh? How to merge?"

The two old men spoke in unison, then looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other's eyes. After that, they snorted and looked in different directions, acting very proud.

"Just like stir-frying."

"?"

"Stir-frying is very important for controlling the heat, and casting and smelting are also very important for controlling the heat. So, as long as you treat the ore like a dish and stir-fry it, wouldn't that kill two birds with one stone?"

Exactly!

This was the method thought of by Chef Li!

"?????"

...

PS: Dear readers, there really is a method called steel-stirring (chao gang), it's not something this failed author made up, -3-'
