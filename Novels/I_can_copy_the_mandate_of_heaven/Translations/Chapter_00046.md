## Chapter 46: The Maid

As they sipped their tea, Li Zhiming let Han Li give Yang Xiangzhu a cup of silver-tipped tea, a favorite of his master's. Initially, Yang Jingshan's eyebrows furrowed after taking the first sip, but seeing Li Zhiming's calm demeanor, he too maintained a composed expression.

The two chatted casually, avoiding serious topics, much like two peers discussing everyday matters. As the time seemed right, Yang Jingshan prepared to leave.

"I brought some trivial gifts, hoping you, Li Xiaodafu, would accept them," Yang Jingshan said, gesturing to a beautifully wrapped, deep-red gift box adorned with colorful ribbons in the corner.

Li Zhiming didn't decline, instead instructing Han Li, "Han Li, take some of my master's 'Qi Xue Wan' to give to Yang Xiangzhu as a small gift."

Yang Jingshan's heart swelled with excitement, nearly showing on his face. The 'Qi Xue Wan' in Yaogu was a medicinal pill developed by Mo Dafu, made from over a hundred types of highly nourishing ingredients. It greatly enhanced a warrior's Qi and blood. However, it was exceptionally expensive, and Mo Dafu rarely gave it away.

Yang Jingshan pondered, wondering if Li Zhiming, despite his young age, truly understood the value of the items left behind by Mo Dafu.

As Yang Jingshan waited, Li Zhiming sent him off, watching until he disappeared into the rain. He then turned to Han Li, who was sitting on the ground, gazing at him intently.

"What are you looking at?" Li Zhiming asked.

"You've been acting more and more like Master in your words and actions," Han Li said.

Li Zhiming nodded slightly, "Perhaps."

As he sat back down, lost in thought, staring out at the increasingly dense rain, he pondered the vastness of the world and the uncertainties of the future. These were questions that could occupy him for a lifetime.

Just as he was deep in thought, Gao Changdong arrived with several maids. Gao Changdong had encountered Yang Jingshan at the entrance of Yaogu and exchanged a polite nod. Yang Jingshan glanced at the maids brought by Gao Changdong.

In the Qixuanmen, it was rare for servants to be used; they didn't follow such customs from top to bottom. Thus, Yang Jingshan couldn't help but look at them several times, noticing their elegant demeanor and refined features.

As Gao Changdong entered the room, he gestured for the maids to come in and avoid the rain. He bowed to Li Zhiming, "These are the maids sent by the Sect Master to attend to your daily needs."

Li Zhiming observed them; there were three of them, all around fourteen to seventeen years old, with fair skin and no flaws. They stood elegantly, dressed in fine silk.

Despite their refined appearance, they still exhibited a hint of fear and shyness. Before coming, they had heard about the young master; the intimidating Qixuanmen elders had sternly warned them that if they slighted this young master, one word from him could send them back to where they came from - not back to their families or the households of the managers, but to the Jiaosi Fang.

The mere mention of Jiaosi Fang made their eyes well up with tears. They were already grateful to have escaped; Gao Changdong's warning made them even more fearful.

Before serving this young master, they had been taken to meet the high-ranking Sect Master of Qixuanmen, the fiery-haired Jiang Yun. Her words still lingered in their ears.

"Before Li Xiaodafu turns fifteen, you must be diligent and obedient!"

"After he comes of age, he is our hope; having served him since young, you must understand how to fulfill your duties as women properly. We spent a great price to rescue you from Jiaosi Fang, not to make you mere servants!"

"To keep him, one must first capture his heart!"

"If you don't understand, Jiaosi Fang can teach you. There, you'll find people who can make you comprehend. I believe those standing before me are not foolish."
