# Chapter 515: Primordial Pure and Turbid Qi

A terrifying, indescribable boom erupted.

The earth was hammered violently like a giant drum.

Brilliant Buddhist light and a massive mountain shadow clashed at the point of impact, holding, annihilating, and exploding against each other.

The shockwave detonated in a ring, and in the wake of the battle between these four peak Golden Core experts, Zhenyuan Temple, which had already lost its protective formations, along with the mountains, rivers, land, and vegetation for dozens of miles around, was utterly wiped from existence.

The earth collapsed deeply, forming a massive crater. At its center, only the scorched, solitary remains of the Immortal Peach Tree, which Wukong had smashed into charcoal, remained for the moment, though it was teetering on the verge of annihilation.

The Tang Monk and his three disciples, who had been frozen in place, their souls terrified out of their bodies by the sudden cataclysm, had long since been blasted away by the world-shattering impact.

If not for the Bodhisattva Miao Di's intentional shielding and the Tripitaka Master's last-ditch effort to activate a Buddhist protective treasure, forming a faint golden light to protect the four of them, they would have been torn to shreds by the overflowing energy.

Even so, the four of them were shaken so badly they spurted blood from their mouths. Like leaves in a gale, they were swept far from the core of the battlefield, crashing into a pile of rubble dozens of miles away. Their faces were ashen, and their breath was faint.

Zhu Bajie was shaken so hard he revealed some of his boar demon features, grunting and groaning.

Sha Wujing had blood at the corners of his mouth, and his crescent-moon spade was broken in half.

Sun Wukong struggled to prop himself up, his golden eyes wide as he stared at the apocalyptic battlefield, a deep fear and confusion首次流露 in his eyes for the first time.

Tang Sanzang was even more pathetic, collapsing to the ground, his eyes empty and despairing, repeatedly muttering, "It's over... it's over... The journey to the East... has ended... Amitabha..."

The connection to the World Honored One Tathagata, who had been bestowing his power upon him, had been completely severed. He could no longer feel the Tathagata's presence.

This collision between the Primordial Sect and the top Golden Core experts of the Bodhisattva's Pure Land was like two massive galaxies colliding head-on, causing the weather of the entire Eastern Wasteland of the Taihua Void Realm to shift violently.

The terrifying fluctuations of laws and chaotic energy instantly drew the probing gazes of countless dormant powerhouses.

The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect was also watching like a tiger at this moment. Given the chance, they would not mind striking a fallen opponent. The three sects had been clashing with each other for countless years, and such a rare opportunity would not be missed.

Let's turn to another branch of the story.

Just as the Pudao True Lord had torn all pretense aside, the Bodhisattva Miao Di had summoned reinforcements, and the former site of Zhenyuan Temple had become a deadly domain for a Golden Core-level battle, a scene entirely different from the one at the Cold Crow Pass, countless miles away.

"Puff! Hiss!"

Deep within the Cold Crow Pass, on a solitary cliff hanging over a sea of clouds and split by a hideous fissure, from the elevated perspective of a Foundation Establishment cultivator's divine sense, three cavern-heavens as vast as black holes violently crashed into each other.

The Primordial Pure and Turbid Qi, which had been accumulating for who knows how many years, like a tsunami finally finding an outlet, once again surged forth violently.

This eruption was far larger in scale than any before. The purest, most pristine, life-nurturing Heavenly Gang Pure Qi, and the heaviest, most turbid, destruction-bearing Earthly Fiend Turbid Qi, like two entangled ancient dragons, frantically tore apart the cliff and shot straight up into the ten-thousand-zhang-high sky,搅得 the already gloomy sky of Cold Crow Pass into even greater chaos.

For a time, the Pure and Turbid Qi filled the heavens and the earth, forming a terrifying phenomenon visible for ten thousand miles.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan was seated cross-legged on a jet-black cliff boulder, polished smooth as a mirror by the Pure and Turbid Qi, on the edge of this violent "tsunami."

His spiritual power surged frantically, and dozens of jade bottles of various materials and different types of treasure light floated densely in front of him.

Under Xu Yunfan's precise divine sense control, these bottles seemed to have gained spirituality. Their mouths opened wide, greedily swallowing the erupting Primordial Pure and Turbid Qi.

Light flickered across the bottle surfaces, faintly forming miniature gathering formations that forcibly compressed and refined the immense source Qi.

Xu Yunfan's face was a bit pale from over-driving his divine sense, but his eyes shone with irrepressible excitement.

"Excellent! This Primordial Pure and Turbid Qi has infinite uses. Even for nurturing my own Dao Foundation, it is a supreme treasure. Using it to condense my Divine神通 Foundation will surely allow me to forge an unparalleled foundation. My clone's foundation can also rise with the tide. It's just a pity about that Immortal Peach Tree..."

Thinking of the treasure tree turned to charcoal by Wukong's staff, a sliver of regret surfaced in Xu Yunfan's heart. How wonderful it would have been if he had gotten his hands on it.

But it was quickly washed away by the immense sense of gain before him.

He silently calculated in his heart: "In the time it takes to burn one incense stick, the first batch of the core of the Pure and Turbid Qi will be refined! This opportunity cannot be missed!"

However, the moment his mind relaxed slightly.

A terrifying shockwave, originating from the direction of the Eastern Wasteland and carrying a fierce, oppressive might and a will of destruction, as if passing through layers of time and space, slammed violently into his mind.

"Ugh!"

Xu Yunfan was caught off guard. His mind shook violently, as if struck head-on by a giant hammer.

He spurted a mouthful of blood, and the jade bottles floating around him instantly went out of control, their light flashing chaotically, about to be blasted away by the violent Pure and Turbid Qi.

At this critical moment, he waved his hand, and Eight Scenery Cloud Qi spread out, instantly enveloping the surroundings and stabilizing everything.

"What was that?!"

Xu Yunfan's expression was grave as he forcefully suppressed his churning blood and chaotic spiritual power.

His mind stirred, and he immediately connected to Wukong's perspective.

In an instant, his vision was filled with a riot of colors.

The collision of immortal light and Buddhist fire.

The collapse of mountain shadows and dharma seals.

The entire heaven and earth was torn apart like a tattered cloth.

A considerable portion of the Eastern Wasteland had been wiped out.

Accompanying this were the three manifested Bodhisattvas and two terrifying True Lord Dharma Forms, like pillars supporting the heavens, standing in the four directions of the Eastern Wasteland.

"Inhale!"

Even though Xu Yunfan's will was firm, he was still shocked into drawing a cold breath by this apocalyptic battle, which he had witnessed indirectly through Wukong's eyes and which far exceeded the limits of his current cultivation realm.

This level of power was far beyond what a Foundation Establishment True Person could imagine.

Cultivation, cultivation—truly, every step is a new heaven. Every time one crosses a major realm, earth-shaking changes occur.

The battle at Zhenyuan Temple had actually evolved into a world-ending collision between two top sects.

However, the ripples from these battles were rapidly converging.

It wasn't that these True Lords cherished the heavens and the earth, but that if too much was destroyed, the natural laws of this world would surely inflict immeasurable karma, clouding their minds.

In simple terms, it meant everything they did would fail. They would be unable to succeed in anything.

If they wanted to渡 tribulation and become Great True Lords, they would have to contend with the heavens themselves. The heavens would interfere, and their chance of success would drop to zero.

It was the house rigging the game.

Thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning. Xu Yunfan immediately understood that the explosive development at Zhenyuan Temple had far exceeded his plans.

The Primordial Sect was deliberately inciting a great battle, seemingly wanting to trigger the great tribulation ahead of schedule.

Just as Xu Yunfan's mind was reeling, while he desperately tried to stabilize the jade bottles吸摄 the Pure and Turbid Qi and sort through the impact this upheaval would have on him...

"Whoosh!"

A figure, as if flowing from the shadows of the cliff itself, appeared silently not far behind Xu Yunfan.
