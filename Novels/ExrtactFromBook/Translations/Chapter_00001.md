# Chapter 1: Slaying the Demons  

On his third day in this world, Han Yue was already backed into a corner.  

If he didn't kill the city lord and his entire family tonight, he would have no choice but to end his own life.  

With less than three hours left before the banquet began, Han Yue suppressed his emotions.  

Standing in front of the stove, he carefully sliced a foot-long piece of cured meat with a kitchen knife.  

The meat was vibrant in color, perfectly smoked, yet holding it made Han Yue nauseous.  

Slice after slice, his knife skills were impeccable. The knife in his hand, forged from no ordinary metal, gleamed with a dull yellow hue, cutting the meat as thin as cicada wings.  

Before long, the entire piece was sliced clean.  

A dark-skinned, thin child stood silently beside him.  

As soon as Han Yue finished, the child wordlessly handed him another piece.  

They worked in this manner from afternoon until dusk, when a pig-faced monster entered the kitchen.  

"The guests have arrived, Master Chef Han," the pig-faced creature said. "The banquet begins in fifteen minutes."  

"All the ingredients are prepared. We await your knife skills!"  

Han Yue set down his knife and nodded, signaling for the monster to leave first.  

As the pig demon turned to go, a thread-bound ancient book—visible only to Han Yue—materialized before his eyes.  

He flipped to the second page and placed his right palm upon it.  

Closing his eyes, he began to recall.  

His childhood training in modern fencing, the bayonet drills from his military days, every ingredient he had ever sliced since falling in love with cooking, and all the cured meat he had prepared in this very kitchen since crossing into this world.  

Every memory related to cutting was summoned by the book's power.  

In his mind's eye, a dial with numerous markings appeared.  

A needle slowly moved across it.  

As his memories flowed in, the needle passed the first mark and settled into the second, which shimmered alternately in blue and purple.  

**Ding! Conditions for extraction met. Extract ability?**  
**Keyword for this extraction: Cutting!**  

"Extract!" Han Yue didn't hesitate.  

**Ding! Congratulations! You have obtained the ability: [Raiden Shogun · Musou no Hitotachi]!**  

In an instant, a surge of mysterious power flowed from the book into Han Yue's body.  

He closed his eyes, sensing a small purple knife wreathed in lightning traveling through his meridians before settling into his sea of consciousness.  

There, it joined a swirling golden light already present.  

---  

The purple knife took its place beside the golden radiance, the two colors intertwining brilliantly.  

Han Yue stowed the ancient book away and stepped out of the kitchen.  

Two figures awaited him outside—the pig-faced monster from earlier and a goat standing upright on two legs.  

The goat had only partially transformed, its arms human-like while the rest remained distinctly bestial, far less refined than the pig demon.  

Without a word, Han Yue nodded at them and strode toward the inner courtyard.  

The two monsters hurried after him, carrying a long table between them.  

On it lay a naked young woman, her fair skin unblemished, her figure exquisite.  

Bound tightly with red silk, her limbs were arranged in an alluring pose. A gag of the same fabric stifled her cries, leaving only muffled whimpers.  

Her eyes, wide with terror and despair, betrayed her awareness of what awaited her.  

She was the banquet's main course.  

"Master Han," the pig demon fawned as they walked, "your idea is brilliant! A live female feast—just the thought makes my mouth water!"  

"Slaughtering her fresh, serving the tender parts raw with soy sauce, grilling, boiling, or frying the rest—such a spectacle! Such flavor!"  

"I can hardly keep from drooling!"  

"Pity I’m not important enough to join the feast. I’ll just have to watch from the sidelines."  

"Could you spare some scraps for me, Master Han? Just a taste!"  

"Me too! Baa!" The goat demon’s speech was still clumsy, punctuated by bleats.  

Han Yue finally spoke, his voice hoarse with exhaustion. "Of course."  

Soon, they arrived at the grand banquet hall, ablaze with light and raucous noise.  

At the center sat a strikingly handsome yet sinister man, laughing with his guests.  

The attendees were a grotesque assortment—humanoid beasts, horned faces, fanged horrors, some no taller than a foot, others stretching nearly ten.  

Spotting Han Yue, the beautiful man announced, "Gentlemen, I’ve recently acquired a human chef whose skills leave me craving more. I live for his meals now!"  

"Tonight, you shall judge for yourselves whether I exaggerate."  

"Thank you, Lord City Lord!" the demons chorused.  

"Let the feast begin!"  

The monsters' eyes gleamed with ravenous hunger, devoid of humanity, brimming only with primal desire.  

Han Yue stood beside the long table, glanced at the bound girl, took a deep breath, and raised his knife.  

The next instant, golden light erupted through the hall.  

Han Yue became a streak of brilliance, lunging at the demons.  

His right hand, gripping the kitchen knife, erupted with dazzling purple lightning, slicing through the air as though cleaving space itself.  

Golden light flashed simultaneously before every demon.  

Against the purple blade, their supposedly invulnerable bodies tore like cloth, incinerating into ash under the lightning’s fury.  

Then, just as swiftly, Han Yue reappeared in his original spot.  

The banquet hall was silent. Not a single demon remained alive.  

Gasping for breath, Han Yue crackled with residual lightning. For a moment, he felt unstoppable, as if nothing could withstand his blade.  

This was the fleeting power boost from [Musou no Hitotachi].  

His body and spirit had been tempered by the lightning’s divine energy. His vitality surged, his mind sharpened, and even his sea of consciousness had expanded.  

Twenty seconds later, the lightning faded, but Han Yue had already undergone physical and mental rebirth.  

Unbeknownst to him, the infusion of this power had elevated him to a first-rank cultivator in the Body Entry Realm.  

Approaching the table, he untied the girl’s bonds and helped her up.  

"Miss," he said, "I’ve killed all the demons here. We’re safe for now."  

"But this is still demon territory. The city is crawling with them. We’ll be discovered sooner or later."  

"I plan to escape at dawn, but... I can’t take you with me. I’m sorry."  

His voice trembled slightly.  

"You needn’t worry about me, Immortal."  

"You’ve avenged my family. I have no way to repay you except with this."  

She kowtowed three times, then suddenly sprang up and dashed headfirst into the wall, dying instantly.  

Her despair had long since consumed her.  

Han Yue exhaled heavily, covered her with the red silk, then took an oil lamp and doused the fabric.  

With a single spark, he set it aflame.
