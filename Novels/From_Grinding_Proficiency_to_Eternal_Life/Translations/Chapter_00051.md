# Chapter 51: Iron Bridge Town Pass

Xu Yunfan let out a soft laugh. The iron-faced man before him was only at the minor completion stage of training, not even a martial master, yet his tone was incredibly arrogant. This was something Xu Yunfan hadn't expected.

He immediately lost interest. With the iron-faced man being so secretive, the Golden Crow Bone Tempering Chapter was definitely not genuine. Even if it were a real technique, it was likely just a case of "selling dog meat under the sign of a sheep"—deceptive advertising.

Xu Yunfan stood before the iron-faced man, fell silent for a moment, and then turned to leave without a word.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's reaction, the iron-faced man's eyes flickered. The judge's pen in his hand lifted slightly, his gaze fixed intently on Xu Yunfan's retreating figure.

After a long while, the judge's pen in the iron-faced man's wrist suddenly twitched half an inch upward. The pen, made of silver-iron and gold-stone, struck the inkstone, sending sparks flying.

After circling the entire black market, Xu Yunfan found that besides the martial arts manuals being hawked, there were also various medicinal herbs he couldn't name, emitting a pungent medicinal fragrance.

In a corridor dedicated to selling herbs, a strange medicinal aroma wafted through the air. An old woman with a face veil, dressed in a purple satin jacket, carried a vine basket, her withered-branch-like fingers fiddling with dried red blood vines. At the foot of a man in a conical hat stood a three-legged bronze cauldron, in which dark green medicinal juice was bubbling. Beside him was a flagpole that read: 'Hundred Grass Soup, can strengthen blood and Qi.'

Xu Yunfan's nostrils flared slightly as he caught the earthy smell of the "century-old ginseng" pile from fifteen paces away—it was clearly a fake made from dyed balloon flower roots.

"Damn it... this is definitely a black market," Xu Yunfan cursed silently in his heart.

He examined the weapon stalls carefully. The熟 copper mace was engraved with suspicious cloud and thunder patterns, and the joints of the nine-section whip were still stuck with fresh iron slag. It wasn't until he caught sight of a broken knife on a blue cloth that Xu Yunfan stopped in his tracks.

The broken edge of the blade was jagged like a wolf's tooth, and the remaining four inches of the edge were covered with serrated nicks.

They were all ordinary weapons. Only this broken knife seemed to be at the Sharp Edge level. Unfortunately, only a quarter of the blade remained, and the edge was full of notches.

The seller had a sharp eye and naturally knew this broken knife was extraordinary. Seeing Xu Yunfan staring at it without blinking, he began to introduce it.

"A good eye you have, sir!"

The seller, revealing his yellowed teeth, moved closer. "This is a treasure from the Tiger Ben Camp in the Central State. Back in the Western Desert, it shattered seven弯 blades of the same level."

"It's your lying tongue that got shattered, right?" A scar-faced man selling meteor hammers spat. "This piece of scrap iron would even smoke too much if used as firewood!"

Xu Yunfan flicked the spine of the blade with his finger and frowned at the dull thud. The blade did contain some cold iron, but this knife had clearly been through a fierce battle. The smooth break indicated it had been cleanly severed by someone. The cost of melting it down for recasting was far greater than forging a new sharp blade.

He glanced one last time at the faintly visible "Break the Prisoner" inscription on the hilt, tightened the handle of the golden hammer on his back, ignored the two men arguing, and turned to leave.

After walking around the caves selling various rare and exotic items, Xu Yunfan's hopes were dashed. It made sense; if there really were a Bodhisattva statue entwined with ominous energy, the owner would have been dead long ago. How could it be here for sale?

Suddenly, the sound of a pottery jar shattering came from the northwest corner.

In the corner, a hunchbacked old man in a tattered jacket was gripping a hemp-clothed youth's wrist tightly. In the youth's fallen hand, an old silk book bore the four powerful characters: "Iron Bridge Town Pass."

"Two hundred taels!" The youth, his face flushed red, struggled desperately to break free from the hunchback's grip, but the old man's hand was like an iron hoop, unmoving.

"This came from the Iron Clothes Sect's ruins..."

"Shut up!" The hunchback's face turned cold. His fingers suddenly dug into the hemp-clothed youth's wrist, making the youth's entire arm go numb, unable to speak further. He sneered repeatedly. "How dare a hawk from Beimang Mountain cause trouble here? I wonder how many things you dug up from the ground... One hundred taels."

"Iron Bridge Town Pass?" Xu Yunfan's voice suddenly reached the hunchback and the youth.

The deep voice made the hunchback's body stiffen slightly. He turned to see a tower-like strong man standing beside him. The hemp-clothed youth's lips trembled, too scared to speak.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan reached out and grabbed the hand with which the hunchback was holding the youth's wrist. The immense finger force made the hunchback's heart tremble with shock. The powerful force made his fingers spasm, and he had to let go of the youth's wrist. Xu Yunfan didn't even glance at the hunchback; his eyes were fixed on the youth.

Neither of these two was a good person—one was a greedy hunchback, the other was a grave robber who dug up the dead.

"Do you have the martial arts of the Iron Clothes Sect?" Xu Yunfan asked.

The youth nodded hurriedly, his expression cautious. "This is a fragment, the essentials of Iron Bridge Town Pass. The complete version is a supreme art that leads directly to the Blood Exchange Realm. I only found half of the Bone Tempering essentials."

Bone Tempering?!

He just happened to need a bone tempering method.

Xu Yunfan said, "Show me. If it's real, I'll pay two hundred taels for it."

The hunchback's eyes flashed with a cold glint. "Kid, that manual is something I have my eyes on!"

Xu Yunfan glanced at the hunchback and reached out his large hand. The hunchback tried to step back to dodge, but his pupils contracted sharply. He saw Xu Yunfan's large hand instantly cut through the air and land on his shoulder.

The hunchback's face changed drastically. He said urgently, "This is the black market; you can't fight here!"

Xu Yunfan let out a soft laugh, loosened his grip slightly, and patted the hunchback's shoulder. "Brother, how much are you offering?"

The hunchback fell silent for a moment, then said, "Five hundred taels."

"I'll offer one thousand taels!"

Hearing Xu Yunfan's毫不犹豫 words, the hunchback felt a suffocating pain in his chest. "You..."

He glared fiercely at Xu Yunfan. Seeing Xu Yunfan's gaze turn icy cold, he immediately turned and left without another word. One thousand taels—he wouldn't even earn that much in a year of trading here.

Xu Yunfan turned his gaze to the hemp-clothed youth, his expression indifferent. "Can I inspect the goods?"

"Of, of course!" The youth nodded hurriedly and took out the crumpled silk book from his chest.

On the silk book, the four characters "Iron Bridge Town Pass" were as black as iron.

Xu Yunfan flipped through it and read the opening.

*You discovered the Iron Bridge Town Pass Bone Tempering Fragment. After carefully pondering it, you feel a vague understanding, but upon closer reflection, it seems elusive.*

Watching the information prompt floating in his vision, Xu Yunfan felt a slight excitement. The trip to the black market wasn't in vain; he had at least gotten what he wanted.

He had heard about the Iron Clothes Sect from Old Man Lü. It was originally a major sect in Qingzhou, but it was wiped out overnight, likely by the joint forces of several major sects in Qingzhou. Although the Iron Clothes Sect didn't operate outside Qingzhou, its Iron Bridge Town Pass technique, when cultivated to its peak, could break through the Muscle Tempering Great Master level and reach the Blood Exchange Realm.

The Iron Clothes Sect specialized in Bone Tempering.

Although this fragment of the Bone Tempering chapter wasn't the core essential, it should be sufficient for achieving great success in Bone Tempering.

Xu Yunfan casually took a stack of silver notes from his chest, extracted one thousand taels of silver, and handed it to the hemp-clothed youth.
