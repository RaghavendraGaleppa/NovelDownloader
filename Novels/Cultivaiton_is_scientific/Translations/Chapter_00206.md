# Chapter 206: Alchemy  

"What treasure is this?" Senior Sister Ye Jingxian didn't stand on ceremony and immediately took the Monkey Spirit Wine from Li Shiming.  

She opened the flask and sniffed, sensing the effects of the wine. Her expression shifted slightly.  

"Shiming, do you have any other uses for this Monkey Spirit Wine?" Elder Su asked with a smile.  

"Master, since my physical cultivation has reached its peak, the wine is of no use to me anymore. Please accept it as a token of my respect!" Li Shiming replied, thinking his master had taken a liking to the wine.  

He had no reason to be stingy with the wine. His master had helped him immensely—just the ownership of Swordholding Peak alone was an enormous benefit, not to mention everything else.  

"It's not for me. Your senior sister is stuck at the half-step Golden Core realm and needs various methods to strengthen her Dao Body. This wine will be useful to her," Elder Su explained with a laugh.  

"If Senior Sister needs it, then please take it!" Li Shiming waved his hand, hearing that the wine could aid her breakthrough to the Golden Core realm.  

"Junior Brother, I won't take advantage of you for nothing. If you need anything, just ask me!" Ye Jingxian said as she stored the wine away.  

She had considered offering spirit stones, but she had heard from Tianmu Trading House that Li Shiming had placed large orders for goods, indicating he wasn't short on spirit stones.  

Not knowing what else he might lack, she figured that as her junior brother, she could compensate him generously whenever he made a request.  

"Today is Shiming's first visit, so I shall speak of my Dao," Elder Su said, glancing at his five disciples, with a particular emphasis on Li Shiming.  

Dao lectures were the most important form of inheritance between master and disciple. Through words, aura, spiritual power, and divine sense, the master created a unique environment that embodied their understanding of the Dao.  

Of course, Elder Su wasn't asking his disciples to replicate his path. Instead, he was presenting his insights as a reference for them.  

The Dao was the foundation of cultivation, upon which all other techniques were built—at least for Li Shiming's main cultivation method. This was also where Li Shiming lacked theoretical knowledge.  

After an hour of lecturing, the Golden Core elder's understanding of the Dao deepened Li Shiming's comprehension of his own cultivation method.  

As Elder Su had said, solitary study was not ideal. The lecture provided Li Shiming with a clearer perspective on his own cultivation.  

After the lecture, Li Shiming raised the questions he had encountered during his cultivation. Previously, he had relied on IBMz15 to analyze problems and choose the most promising solutions.  

Now, with a master, he could finally obtain precise answers instead of groping in the dark.

"Shiming, although Swordholding Peak generates considerable income, you should still consider earning contribution points alongside your cultivation. With your array skills, taking on missions shouldn't be difficult," Elder Su advised as Li Shiming prepared to leave Tianmu Peak.  

Returning to Swordholding Peak, Li Shiming reflected on his recent actions. He realized that the rapid progress from "Purple Qi from the East" had made him somewhat impatient.  

The hundredfold increase in violet qi from "Purple Qi from the East" had limited effects on his main cultivation method, "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique." Its greatest benefit was reshaping his foundation and enhancing his Dao Body.  

The Foundation Establishment stage was a long process. Even for a Heaven Spiritual Root, advancing from early to mid-Foundation Establishment would take about a decade, assuming no bottlenecks.  

He needed to plan his cultivation carefully and set a realistic schedule.  

As for earning contribution points, he had his own ideas.  

He entered an empty room in his cave abode, intending to turn it into an alchemy chamber.  

He now possessed both artifact forging and alchemy legacies. After some consideration, he decided to start with alchemy.  

Within the Shushan Sect, he didn't need to worry about safety—his focus was solely on improving his strength.  

What he lacked were pills. Early Foundation Establishment pills required contribution points to exchange or had to be self-refined.  

Confident in his learning ability, he trusted his own alchemy skills more.  

He had an upper-grade magic tool cauldron, sufficient for beginners, and a large stock of first-grade spiritual herbs for practice.  

This was why he prioritized alchemy—he wouldn't face material shortages during the initial learning phase.  

For his first attempt, he chose spirit charcoal as the flame source, the most common method for refining low-grade pills according to Elder Ma's legacy.  

He selected "Fasting Pills," the simplest and most basic pill recipe, which only required refining spirit rice without any pre-processing.  

Li Shiming lit three pieces of spirit charcoal—made from carbonized spiritual wood—and activated the "Golden Sun Flame Control Art," adjusting the flame size.  

Once the cauldron heated up, he tossed in the spirit rice. Before he could even use the "Green Willow Spirit Sensing Art" to monitor the rice, a burnt smell wafted from the cauldron.  

His expression froze. His first attempt at alchemy had ended before it even began.  

IBMz15 recorded the first attempt's data—spiritual energy fluctuations, the rice's condition, and the charcoal's temperature—all meticulously logged through spiritual sense.  

After cleaning the cauldron with spiritual water, he tried again, this time lowering the temperature.  

Alchemy legacies were merely guidelines. The cultivation world's temperature measurements were vague, making self-taught alchemy a process of trial and error.  

However, once he established rough reference temperatures for the ambiguous descriptions in the legacy, his failure rate would drop significantly.  

In truth, Elder Ma's legacy wasn't meant for independent study—it was a hint for Li Shiming to seek his guidance.  

But Li Shiming misunderstood, treating the legacy as a straightforward gift and attempting to become an alchemist on his own.  

After resolving temperature issues, he encountered challenges in sensing the rice's changes. Though the "Green Willow Spirit Sensing Art" allowed him to perceive energy shifts, the legacy's vague instructions left him needing concrete data.  

Failure after failure, IBMz15's alchemy database grew, and Li Shiming's understanding of "Fasting Pills" deepened.  

On the twenty-fifth attempt, the "Green Willow Spirit Sensing Art" detected the rice transforming into a balanced, viscous liquid.  

He tapped the cauldron seven times—the "Seven-Finger Pill Collection Art."  

Each tap caused the liquid to roll along the cauldron walls, thickening further.  

On the seventh tap, five perfectly round pills flew out.  

Li Shiming inspected one—a mid-grade first-grade pill. The other four were the same.  

"Not bad, but where did I go wrong?" he mused. Producing mid-grade pills on his first successful attempt was commendable.  

But with IBMz15's database support, he wasn't satisfied with just mid-grade results.  

He wouldn't even consume mid-grade "Fasting Pills" himself—they contained impurities, making spirit rice a better option.  

Repeating the process with the database's guidance, he smoothly produced eight pills, including one high-grade.  

Analyzing the data, he identified the conditions for high-grade pills.  

On the third repetition, he obtained ten high-grade pills—the limit for normal alchemists. Top-grade pills were rare anomalies, achievable only through sheer volume.  

Li Shiming adjusted his schedule, reducing "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique" practice to four hours and replacing sleep with cultivation.  

The saved time went entirely into alchemy.  

With a complete legacy, ample materials, and IBMz15's analysis, his skills improved steadily, and errors dwindled.  

A month later, he successfully refined "Bright Heart Nine Palaces Pills," a mid-to-late Qi Refinement auxiliary pill from the Bright Heart Sect's legacy.  

Stable high-grade first-grade pills—the pinnacle of Qi Refinement alchemy—qualified him as a junior alchemist.  

This change in schedule also affected Li Yuanba, his clone.  

With his three tasks completed, Li Yuanba began accepting combat missions from the Outer Sect Combat Division—ideal for honing his swordsmanship.  

Backed by his zombie servant, Jiang Chen, Li Yuanba completed four missions in a month, eliminating four early Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

The spoils from these kills far surpassed what auxiliary professions could offer, explaining why sword cultivators focused solely on combat.  

However, combat missions were perilous—every cultivator had hidden cards.  

But Li Yuanba, trained in the "Sword Demon Secret Canon" and enhanced by Monkey Spirit Wine, boasted near-artifact-level defenses, with Jiang Chen as his ultimate safeguard.  

Having mastered high-grade "Bright Heart Nine Palaces Pills," Li Shiming hit a ceiling—he lacked recipes and materials for Foundation Establishment pills.  

Remembering Elder Ma, he decided to visit him.  

He plucked leaves from his spirit tea tree, refined them in his machine space, and packed them as a gift—one of the few valuable items he could offer.  

With precise control and alchemy-enhanced techniques, this batch surpassed all previous ones.  

Carrying the gift, he flew to Elder Ma's Alchemy Cauldron Peak.  

After sending a message, he waited patiently outside.  

"Finally!" Elder Ma chuckled inside, having anticipated this visit for months.  

"Wait," came the reply, making Li Shiming assume Elder Ma was busy refining.  

Inside, Elder Ma leisurely read a book, unconcerned about Li Shiming's impatience.
