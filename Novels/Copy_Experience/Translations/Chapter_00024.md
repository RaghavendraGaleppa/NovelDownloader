# Chapter 24: Great Chaos Approaches

Wei State has nine major powers, and the Mo family is relatively at the bottom among them.

Once the news spreads and powerful forces like the Thousand Absolute Sect arrive, the Mo family might not even get a sip of the soup. So, they must seize this opportunity to act quickly and create a time advantage.

"Wait, in that case, can Old Xu still escape? The Mo family might send people to intercept anyone trying to leave to keep the news sealed!"

Lu Xu frowned and hurried back to his home. He couldn't care about external matters; he only wanted to quickly make more mid-grade talismans to ensure his own safety.

Originally, he had thought of directly buying some from other talisman masters. But seeing the bustling scene in front of those talisman stalls, Lu Xu realized that it would be impossible to buy any talismans now. The Divine Talisman Hall's inventory was probably almost sold out, and even if their enshrined masters desperately produced some, they probably wouldn't sell them. At crucial moments, such items were strategic materials that major forces would hoard for unforeseen circumstances.

In his room, Lu Xu took out the unused first-tier mid-grade talisman paper and picked up his talisman brush, beginning to draw.

Three days later, he held a talisman shimmering with faint golden light: a Vajra Talisman!

Lu Xu held the Vajra Talisman in his hand and also took out the Vajra Talisman he had obtained from Tan Hu, comparing the two. "There should be no difference. It seems I have indeed produced a true first-tier mid-grade talisman!" A smile appeared on Lu Xu's face; after entering Qi Refining Layer 4, he could finally produce true mid-grade talismans. "Next, I'll make a pile of mid-grade talismans to ensure my safety. With these, I won't fear anyone in the entire mid-Qi Refining realm!"

As Lu Xu took out blank talisman paper, preparing to continue making talismans, he suddenly heard a commotion downstairs. Walking to the window and opening it, he saw Old Xu and his grandson appear in the courtyard, their faces grim.

"They didn't escape, did they?" Lu Xu thought to himself. He went downstairs.

"Old Xu, why are you back again!"

"Damn it!" Old Xu's face was grim as he cursed. "We were chased back by the Mo family!"

"They've sealed off the east side of the market, not allowing anyone to leave!" Old Xu's face was extremely ugly. Qinghu Market is located at the westernmost end of Wei State. Geographically, it's a salient of Wei State extending into the Ten Thousand Monster Mountain Range, a bridgehead. The market is surrounded on three sides by the Ten Thousand Monster Mountain Range, with only the east side leading to the prosperous areas of Wei State. The east side is fertile land with numerous spiritual fields, where Lu Xu usually worked. Further east lay the mortal town.

And beyond that town, continuing eastward, was considered outside the scope of Qinghu Market. Now that the Mo family had sealed off the eastern exit, to leave the market, one could only head in the other three directions. But those three directions all led into the Ten Thousand Monster Mountain Range.

"Do you know who chased our grandparents back?"

"Who?"

"It was that Mo family member who extorted us before! He recognized me with his spiritual eye technique and threatened to execute us as spies unless I gave him fifty spirit stones!" Old Xu said through gritted teeth.

"It was him?" Mo Qingyuan's face flashed through Lu Xu's mind. If it was that person, it wasn't surprising he would do such a thing.

"What do you plan to do now?" Lu Xu asked.

Old Xu paced back and forth for a moment, then sighed deeply: "We can only take it one step at a time. Paper can't wrap fire; the Mo family certainly can't keep the news sealed!"

"Once the matter leaks out, they won't need to continue sealing the market!"

"Then let's wait a bit longer, there will definitely be a chance to leave!" Lu Xu comforted him. He shared Old Xu's view; the Mo family couldn't keep the news blocked forever. It wouldn't be long before they abandoned this approach, and then there would naturally be an opportunity to leave. He wanted to use this time to quickly produce more first-tier mid-grade talismans.

The production of first-tier mid-grade talismans was much more difficult than low-grade talismans. This was not only reflected in the requirements for the quality of spiritual energy but also in the consumption of mental energy. The complexity of mid-grade talismans was incomparable to low-grade ones, thus consuming more mental energy. Because of this, the number of talismans that could be produced daily would be fewer. Lu Xu, despite his desperate efforts, could only produce one mid-grade talisman every three days.

Three days later, around noon, Lu Xu had just finished drawing a Vajra Talisman.

"Brother Lu, Old Xu, have you heard about the Divine Wood Sect ruins?" A loud shout echoed in the courtyard. Lu Xu opened the window and saw that it was Han Simpleton. Ever since marrying into the Mo family, he often came here. It seemed that because he couldn't integrate into the Mo family environment in a short time, he missed his old friends in the small courtyard more. That's how people are; once they become wealthy, they start reminiscing.

"Why aren't you enjoying life, running over here?" Old Xu appeared at the door, speaking with displeasure. He now had no good expression for anyone related to the Mo family.

"Enjoy what? I just found out that being a Mo family son-in-law isn't easy!" Han Simpleton looked troubled.

"What do you mean by that? You're not happy as a son-in-law?" Lu Xu came out, asking with a smile.

"Alas, did you know that the team sent to explore the Divine Wood Sect ruins has returned!"

"With heavy casualties!" Han Simpleton said worriedly.

Lu Xu heard this and exchanged glances with Old Xu. Both were somewhat surprised. The Mo family's first exploration already had results so quickly?

"Did they gain anything?" Old Xu immediately asked.

"Reportedly, they brought back a hundred-year-old Fire Lily!"

Han Simpleton's words struck Old Xu like a thunderbolt exploding in his ear. He instantly froze. It was a moment later that Old Xu finally recovered.

"Unbelievable, unbelievable, something big is going to happen!" Old Xu paced back and forth, restless and anxious.

Lu Xu's expression also became serious. A hundred-year-old Fire Lily was one of the thirteen auxiliary ingredients required for refining Foundation Establishment Pills, and it wasn't particularly precious in itself. But the crucial point was that if such a spiritual medicine grew in this place, it meant there was definitely a spiritual vein of considerable grade within the ruins. Such a spiritual vein was capable of cultivating the main ingredients for Foundation Establishment Pills!

Foundation Establishment! Anything related to these two words inevitably meant bloodshed!

Sighing deeply, Old Xu said with a grave expression: "The Mo family's old ancestor is quite old and likely won't last many more years!"

"But the Mo family hasn't produced a Foundation Establishment cultivator to succeed him yet. He probably won't miss these ruins this time!"

Lu Xu also realized the seriousness of the problem: "But the other forces in Wei State won't let it go either. There will definitely be a great battle between Foundation Establishment cultivators!"

"It's hard to say if this market can even be preserved!"

Hearing their words, Han Simpleton's face turned pale with fright. He hadn't expected the piece of news he brought to involve so much. "No, Brother Lu, Old Xu, you're not joking, are you? With the Mo family's old ancestor as our pillar of strength, how could the market have problems?"

"If he were still young, he could certainly hold it down!" Lu Xu sighed.

"The Mo family and the Thousand Absolute Sect don't have a good relationship!" Old Xu suddenly revealed another secret.
