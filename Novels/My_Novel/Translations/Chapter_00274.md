# Chapter 274: Liuli's Despair, The Third Characteristic!

Liuli’s heart sank into utter despair as she faced the Third Characteristic. The Defiled Garments were Heaven-ordained, falling into nine distinct categories.

The Yuannan Dao was located south of the Southern Heavenly Domain, governing seven prefectures, six continents, and nine cities. Its territory was vast and expansive.

Domains, Dao, Prefectures, Provinces, Counties... the land was boundless, rich with treasures and hidden resources.

This place was the Huaiyin Prefecture, within the Dongran Lake. The lake domain was vast, concealing countless islands. Its hidden secrets remained difficult to fully uncover.

Legend had it...

Dragon traces were once found here. Deep within the Dongran Lake, a true dragon was said to dwell. The lake produced abundant fish, and several fish markets dominated the shores. Within the lake, "water bandits" and "water thieves" also thrived.

It was said that the ten-thousand-mile Dongran Lake hosted eight thousand water bandits, who called themselves heroes, yet possessed cruel hearts. The islands, strange scenery, rare fruits, treasures, and hidden tombs within the lake were innumerable.

A flower boat sailed amidst the waters. The sky was dark, thunder roared, and heavy rain poured down. White mist and spray rose from the lake surface, creating a hazy scene...

Inside the bottom prison.

Li Xian spoke of "good and bad news." Bian Qiaoqiao trembled all over, her eyes filled with despair. Nan Gong Liuli’s beautiful face turned pale.

After a moment of silence, Bian Qiaoqiao’s eyes reddened, tears welling up. She twisted her body, struggling, her mouth full of complaints. She said she was still young, with great years ahead. If she were sent to some ghostly water altar, she would surely be abused and ruined. She chattered on, extremely noisy.

Nan Gong Liuli had no heart to comfort her, letting her cry and make a fuss. However, having been captured for a long time, she had grown accustomed to the frustration and humiliation. She had even tried to commit suicide. Her mentality had been tempered and was now resilient, gradually calming down.

Li Xian moved a table and chair, about half a zhang high, placing them below Bian Qiaoqiao and Nan Gong Liuli. Although the Flower Cage Gate was despicable, their binding methods were exquisite.

The rope binding them was called the "Flower Rope." It was made from the roots of the "Liaochan Flower," dried and boiled, then twisted and woven together. It appeared light yellow, similar to a regular rope. However, once bound to a person, it was extremely difficult to untie.

The knots would travel around the body. The more one struggled, the tighter the entanglement. If the captive was fierce and struggled violently without stopping, the Flower Rope’s dried roots would gradually be activated, sprouting flowers and bearing fruit. It did not damage the body, but it made the binding even more secure, adding a strange beauty.

Thus, the Flower Cage Gate’s slang referred to "flower nurturing experts" as those with supreme capture skills. If flowers bloomed from struggling, escape was impossible.

Li Xian observed the knots. The Flower Rope crisscrossed, tightly restricting every vital joint. The "Tiger Tendon Rope" bound muscles and bones; once wrapped, one could not move a single inch. The "Flower Rope" left some room, but the entanglement was endless. Once caught, it only grew tighter.

Counting carefully, the two women had been captured for several months. Previously, their families and martial artists of the Jianghu had assisted, setting up a large net to surround them. The two women were locked in iron boxes, carried around to evade pursuit.

Recently, they were transported onto the flower boat, fleeing along the river. The moment they boarded, they were hung here. Realizing escape was hopeless, they attempted to starve themselves to death. They didn't eat or drink for over ten days until Li Xian accidentally boarded the pirate ship, at which point they began eating and drinking again.

Two ropes hung from the top, suspending the two women in mid-air. The more they struggled, the tighter the entanglement. Li Xian’s fingers were nimble as he tried to untie the knots.

Bian Qiaoqiao had been suspended for a long time; being able to loosen it slightly was a great mercy. She urged him on anxiously. Li Xian pried open a knot, and the suspending rope loosened.

Bian Qiaoqiao fell straight down. She cried out in alarm, terrified.

Li Xian raised his hand and caught her, grabbing her waist to stop her fall, and gently placed her on the wooden table. Bian Qiaoqiao’s waist and abdomen landed on the table; having something to cling to and lie on was much better than being suspended high up, swaying with the river waves. Her tense body instantly relaxed, her eyebrows curved in comfort.

Soon, Nan Gong Liuli was also freed. Lying on the table, her beautiful face flushed slightly. She thought, "Lying on the table like this, am I not like a dish, ready to be eaten?"

She secretly glanced at Li Xian. She was gradually getting used to this situation, feeling an inexplicable emotion.

The two women had achieved success in shaping their spines, their waists concealing strength. Now, lying on the table, they could shatter the wooden table with a slight effort from their spine bones. Using the wooden fragments to shoot and kill, ordinary martial artists with shallow cultivation would find it hard to get close.

Nan Gong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao were physically and mentally exhausted, sighing softly, too lazy to resist. Their muscles and bones had not moved for a long time; they only wished for someone to help loosen their blood channels. Li Xian fed them as usual, picking out fish bones and thorns... feeding the fresh white fish meat into their mouths.

Bian Qiaoqiao ate her fill and actually fell asleep, snoring. Li Xian said, "Is she that sleepy? Aren't you two sleeping all day?" Nan Gong Liuli said annoyed, "Try being hung like this. Even if you just fall asleep slightly, the swaying of the boat will wake you up when you bump into each other."

Li Xian said, "That's true. You really have suffered." He casually picked a hair from Nan Gong Liuli's head, twisting the strand to tickle her foot, secretly communicating: "How was yesterday?"

Nan Gong Liuli’s heart stirred, her eyes filled with grievance. She came from a wealthy clan, was dignified and proper since childhood, and supported her family's reputation. Being in such a狼狈 (wretched) state and talking to someone was truly a first. Nan Gong Liuli blinked and then opened her eyes, meaning "good or not."

Li Xian twisted the hair to tickle her, writing on the sole of her foot: "The mechanisms here are complex. I have glimpsed a bit, but I am not sure. The probability of failure in this matter is very high. Have you considered it clearly? Should we try?"

Nan Gong Liuli’s sole was very itchy, suppressing laughter, feeling ashamed repeatedly. She blinked to say yes.

Li Xian chatted casually as usual, asking about Jianghu experiences and heroic deeds... various things. In reality, he was multitasking, secretly using the hair to write: "What is your martial arts cultivation level?"

Nan Gong Liuli glanced at the sleeping Bian Qiaoqiao. She thought this good sister had a really big heart, able to sleep at a time like this.

She blinked several times, indicating both were at the Second Realm of martial arts. On the path of martial arts, the realm was by no means the only standard for measurement. The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion commented on "Heavenly Pride" and "Talent"... treating the realm only as a reference.

Li Xian wrote again: "This place is located on a lake. Surrounded by deep water. Are you afraid of water? Can you swim?" Although he had a way to escape the flower boat, the lake water surrounded them, and fierce fish swarmed... this was also a huge problem. If Nan Gong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao were helpless, the escape plan would die before it was born.

Nan Gong Liuli frowned slightly. Being afraid of water in the Second Realm was known to all. The blood quality of the Third Realm could alleviate the process of "Clear Ascending and Turbid Descending." Nan Gong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao had impressive backgrounds; before walking the Jianghu, their elders offered blood soup. The two women drank it, and their fear of water was relieved.

But wading in water was still dangerous.

She blinked both eyes. Meaning she was both afraid and not afraid.

Li Xian thought, the disciples of large clans and sects really have extraordinary means. He, however, was terrified of water. He said, "Alright. Don't worry. In the coming days, I will slowly explain the mechanism principles. I will discuss an escape plan with you."

Nan Gong Liuli thought: "If I can't untie the ropes, even if I know the mechanism principles, I can't step out of the prison cell."

The two communicated and negotiated. Nan Gong Liuli could only convey information with her eyes, which was extremely inefficient. However, Li Xian was extremely smart, putting himself in her shoes and guessing what Nan Gong Liuli was thinking. He could always answer accurately. Back and forth, it felt as if they were communicating mind-to-mind.

Nan Gong Liuli was very surprised at first, suspecting Li Xian had cultivated "Mind Reading" or "Mind Knowledge" martial arts techniques. But later she realized it wasn't that. This conversation and negotiation gave a feeling of entangled minds. There was an indescribable joy in her heart.

Li Xian secretly transmitted: "The matter of the ropes... is indeed tricky. The Flower Cage Gate's binding technique is top-notch. Even if I personally help untie them, it would take a long time."

"At that time, if my figure is exposed, I will be in danger. This point... ultimately requires you to try it yourself."

Nan Gong Liuli was anxious. If she could untie them, she would have tried to escape long ago. She pleaded in her heart, her beautiful eyes full of expectation, pitiful and moving. "Good hero... I am truly helpless. I hope you can offer an idea."

Li Xian pondered. Although he was willing to save them, he would not risk his life for it. He wrote again: "This rope binds your elbows, wrists, knees, ankles... many important joints. It also bends your hands and feet backward, connecting your two wrists. To untie everything completely is impossible."

"If you want to escape. Choose the most important parts to untie, allowing your hands and feet to separate so you can jump and move. Then quickly escape the boat."

"In the next few days of feeding, I will secretly smear fish blood on your ropes. If you can successfully escape the boat and jump into the lake. The fierce fish in the lake will surely bite. The fishy blood will attract the fish to bite first, which might loosen the ropes. But the danger is very high. Whether it succeeds or not... I cannot be sure."

"Also, with this method... only one of you can escape. Because time is tight, and you have almost no ability to resist. If captured, everything is over."

Li Xian could barely protect himself. All he could do was provide assistance to the best of his ability. Whether they could escape depended on Nan Gong Liuli’s strategy and intelligence.

Nan Gong Liuli pondered. This boy was indeed smart. This plan was a desperate measure, extremely dangerous, but there was a sliver of hope. And it was indeed feasible.

But escaping one meant the other couldn't. Nan Gong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao, whoever escaped first, had to flee immediately. If delayed by half a moment, with hands and feet inconvenient, they would surely be captured.

Nan Gong Liuli couldn't help but hesitate greatly. She knew this plan was dangerous, but she was very willing to try. If handled properly, she could really escape. But Bian Qiaoqiao was simple-minded. If she were abandoned, she would be at a loss, and that would be difficult.

She knew Bian Qiaoqiao’s temperament even better. If Bian Qiaoqiao knew this plan, she would also risk her life to try.

The two women couldn't communicate. Li Xian’s ability to use hair to tickle feet and secretly pass signals was useless on Bian Qiaoqiao, as her feet were clad in beast-leather boots, wrapped tightly.

Nan Gong Liuli sighed softly. After a moment of hesitation, she decided to give the escape opportunity to Bian Qiaoqiao.

"Bian sister is not yet twenty, very young. I have been captured and am gradually used to it. She is always complaining. Well... let her have it."

Li Xian packed the food box and hung the two women back up. Then he left. Nan Gong Liuli watched Li Xian's back, her eyes flickering.

In the following days.

Li Xian fed them at noon. Taking the opportunity to convey mechanism principles, he briefly described the distribution and changes of the narrow paths in the boat. Nan Gong Liuli was very smart and remembered them secretly.

The flower boat’s mechanisms contained a universe within, changing with the climate and time. The complex changes within were no less than a set of martial arts.

Li Xian used his dual pupils to see through and spy on secrets. Combined with the escape with Wen Caishang, the medicinal meals and feng shui used along the way all involved "Five Elements and Eight Trigrams," "Zhou Tian Yi Principles," "Star Theory"... many miscellaneous studies.

Although he didn't fully master them. But Wen Caishang’s knowledge was profound and thick, her words concise and to the point. She cultivated Li Xian as her husband, so the knowledge she imparted was condensed with deep meaning.

When Li Xian pondered the boat's mechanisms, the principles and knowledge Wen Caishang had taught naturally surfaced in his mind. It was as if complex and obscure principles turned into practical applications, appearing before his eyes. With the characteristics of "Observing the World" and "Mind Clarity," he surprisingly mastered the miscellaneous mechanism studies without a teacher.

The boat's mechanisms were complex, with many layouts hiding the wonder of the universe. Ye Chengde had the mechanism boat diagram and studied it for years to master it. He never imagined that Li Xian, relying entirely on his透视 (x-ray vision) and various miscellaneous studies... could glimpse a bit of it.

During these days of contact, Nan Gong Liuli was curious about Li Xian's identity. Talking deeply with him, she was extremely shocked.

Li Xian’s words were concise, never verbose, and never showed off his knowledge. Nan Gong Liuli came from a wealthy family and also liked to study miscellaneous subjects. With a slight hint in his speech, she realized Li Xian’s miscellaneous knowledge was extremely broad, his talent undeniable.

Many of his insights were several levels deeper than her family elders. Actually, although Li Xian was smart, he was young and his understanding couldn't reach such a level. His knowledge came from Wen Caishang; many principles were just recited.

Nan Gong Liuli pondered carefully and gradually understood the boat's mechanism principles. This place was a "Heaven and Earth Severing" trap. But as the universe within the boat alternated, it was also extremely close to a chance of life.

The distribution of narrow paths, the layout of mechanisms... gradually formed a silhouette in her mind. She drafted a route that could avoid detection and escape when they were off guard.

Li Xian had already told her everything he knew. How the two women would escape, he could no longer assist. He watched the wind and the moon. Tonight the west wind was blowing, perhaps a good opportunity to escape. He secretly informed Nan Gong Liuli to make a quick decision.

Nan Gong Liuli nodded secretly. Her gaze was firm as she looked at Bian Qiaoqiao. She counted the time. There was only dim candlelight in the prison cell. Time passed, impossible to judge, so she silently recorded the time in her heart.

Around Haishi (9-11 PM), the sky was dark. She knew that at this time, Ye Chengde was surely eating precious food with the Ferryman. He had no time to pay attention to them.

She twisted her waist, swayed her body, and bumped into Bian Qiaoqiao. Bian Qiaoqiao was sleeping in a daze and was suddenly woken up, looking confused.

Nan Gong Liuli’s mouth was blocked, unable to speak. She thought: "Even if I explain the mechanism principles to Bian sister, she won't understand. It's better to directly tell her how to escape."

She opened her eyes wide, very serious. Bian Qiaoqiao saw her eyes burning like fire, immediately became spirited, and looked at her in confusion. Their eyes met, glances crossing. Bian Qiaoqiao was simple-minded, but having suffered together with Nan Gong Liuli, their moods were faintly aligned. She immediately understood that Nan Gong Liuli had a plan to escape.

The two women were hung separately, about a zhang apart. Nan Gong Liuli swayed her body, moving towards Bian Qiaoqiao. The two women were like two pendulums, swaying left and right, skirts and hair fluttering.

Nan Gong Liuli groaned. Bian Qiaoqiao seemed to understand and also swayed her body towards Nan Gong Liuli. The two women bumped together with a "bang."

Nan Gong Liuli took the opportunity to grab Bian Qiaoqiao’s ponytail. Bian Qiaoqiao clamped Nan Gong Liuli’s skirt. In this way, they stopped swaying.

The two women had tried various methods since being hung in the prison cell. The act of mutually untying ropes had been repeated over a hundred times, but they couldn't loosen them in the slightest.

Bian Qiaoqiao was puzzled and thought: "Sister Liuli still hasn't given up. Well... I'll just accompany her." Although she held no hope in her heart, she cooperated.

Nan Gong Liuli reached out to feel, groping for the knots on Bian Qiaoqiao’s body. Guided by Li Xian, she knew the locations of several key knots. Her fingers were slender and quickly found them. She thought: "Just untie these two spots, and Bian sister’s hands and feet can separate, freeing her from suspension. Although she will still be bound, she will have the ability to move."

"Then, through the narrow mechanism paths, escape the flower boat. Jump into the lake. Her ropes have been smeared with fish blood. When the lake fish bite, the other ropes will surely loosen. Bian sister can then take the opportunity to escape."

She ran the plan through her mind.

Nan Gong Liuli reached out to untie the knots, her heart filled with anxiety. She wanted to be quick. The knot position was very awkward; she couldn't reach her own, but she could reach Bian Qiaoqiao’s.

Her fingertips hid strength, prying open the knot. Bian Qiaoqiao’s hands and feet finally separated. Her muscles and bones felt as if they had been smoothed. Extremely comfortable. She fell from the height, her feet touching the ground.

Bian Qiaoqiao groaned: "Sister Liuli, I'll help you untie!" She jumped lightly, using lightness skill to step onto the table. Her hands were still bound behind her back, reaching back to untie.

But without Li Xian’s guidance, finding the knots would take a lot of time. Finding the "knots" in the Flower Cage Gate had an elegant name called "Searching for Flowers." By the time she found them, she might have fallen into the贼手 (thieves' hands) again. Nan Gong Liuli’s body trembled slightly, her internal energy弹 (sprang), pushing Bian Qiaoqiao away.

Bian Qiaoqiao was very surprised, falling towards the ground. Her feet touched the ground, showing her lightness skill was extraordinary. She flipped lightly in the air and landed steadily, looking at Nan Gong Liuli in confusion.

Both had麻核桃 (numbing walnuts) in their mouths. Nan Gong Liuli groaned: "You escape first." Bian Qiaoqiao frowned, naturally unwilling.

The two women’s speech was blocked, making communication extremely difficult. Nan Gong Liuli had already imagined this situation. Her palm hid strength, striking into the empty air. Because her arms couldn't stretch, the move was very distorted.

Bian Qiaoqiao saw it. This palm was called "Ancestor Dao's Soft Palm." It was a basic martial art of the Dao Xuan Mountain. The Nan Gong family and the Dao Xuan Mountain had close ties through the generations. Although Nan Gong Liuli was not a disciple of the Dao Xuan Mountain, she had entered the mountain to practice.

This move was called "Farewell for Now." Soft Palm... meant gentle and lingering. The Dao Xuan Mountain claimed to be the orthodox martial art. Its basic martial arts had been passed down for a long time, flaws long since filled, and spent painstaking effort to research... reaching the peak realm, which could be expected.

Nan Gong Liuli’s palm had the attainment of "reaching the peak." The move "Farewell for Now" aimed for decisiveness in the palm strike. Bian Qiaoqiao deeply understood the essence of martial arts. Thinking "Farewell for Now" implied "parting ways today."

It was like a close friend saying "Farewell for Now,"必然 (inevitably) leading to separation. Used in palm techniques, it hid killing moves behind. A move that connects the past and the future.

Bian Qiaoqiao had always known Nan Gong Liuli’s temperament and nodded. Nan Gong Liuli executed two more moves: "The Great River Flows East" and "A Hundred Turns of Soft Intestines." They belonged to the "Ancestor Dao's Soft Palm" and "Nan Gong Long Fist" respectively.

"The Great River Flows East" was a move where the Ancestor Dao, in his later years, sighed at the rushing rivers. The Great Wu Empire’s river systems were complex. Flows east, flows west... all existed. This palm energy went east, meaning to escape eastward.

"A Hundred Turns of Soft Intestines" was a family martial art of the Nan Gong family. It was very profound. Nan Gong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao were close, often discussing martial arts, combining the essentials of both families.

Bian Qiaoqiao was playful and lazy, but had卓越 (outstanding) talent in martial arts. She immediately understood the deep meaning, guessing that there were countless mechanism secret paths here, and escaping east might have a chance of life.

Bian Qiaoqiao was still entangled by the ropes. Her hands and feet were bound together. She ran to the prison door, bumped it with her shoulder, but the door was tightly locked. And it was bound by an iron chain.

Her eyes flashed. There was a fine dagger hidden in her beast-leather boots. Since their capture, aside from their swords being removed, their clothes and accessories were intact. No one expected a fine dagger to be hidden in her boots.

She bit the dagger handle with her mouth and cut the chain. Pushing open the prison door, she used lightness skill to flee. With a few jumps, she was several zhang away.

Nan Gong Liuli watched her leave. After she disappeared into the darkness, a cold wind blew, leaving her hanging alone in the dark place. An indescribable loneliness and fear.

She was not selfless. At this moment, she regretted giving the escape opportunity to Bian Qiaoqiao. Imagining the future, Bian Qiaoqiao would escape and return to the Dao Xuan Mountain as a high disciple. She, however, would have a difficult fate, not knowing where to go or who to control.

She couldn't help but shed tears, extremely sorrowful.

Bian Qiaoqiao fled eastward. She quickly reached a long, narrow path. She gritted her heart, ignoring everything. She fled eastward.

Running at great speed, her heart was full of tension, sweat pouring from her palms and soles. The boat's paths and mechanisms were complex; fleeing only eastward was almost impossible to escape. Nan Gong Liuli’s mouth was blocked. The move "A Hundred Turns of Soft Intestines" actually hid three layers of palm energy.

It meant three "Mechanism Response Methods." But the mechanism principles were extremely complex. It was truly asking too much for Bian Qiaoqiao to understand and apply them immediately while fleeing.

Li Xian observed secretly, sighing softly. He thought: "If I don't help, this girl will surely run in circles."

He waited in advance at a certain place. Pretending to encounter Bian Qiaoqiao by chance, half chasing and half driving... guiding her to flee in the correct direction.

Bian Qiaoqiao, in her panic, ran even faster. Li Xian, to clear suspicion, shouted loudly along the way. Gradually, more people chased Bian Qiaoqiao.

Suddenly, she saw light ahead. She had escaped the cabin and arrived at the open deck. The bright moon hung high, shining like a silver basin. She hadn't seen the sun for a long time and found it dazzling.

Amidst her ecstasy, she felt at a loss. Seeing the pursuers killing their way close, she would be captured and taken back again. She would rather die than suffer humiliation again.

Her heart was set.

She jumped straight into the lake. Immediately, countless red fish rushed to bite. Ye Chengde arrived late. Seeing this, he couldn't help but change color. He figured that this woman was in the Second Realm of martial arts, her hands and feet bound, jumping into the water and being bitten by a swarm of fish, she would surely not survive.

Even if they fished her out, it would be a skeleton. He secretly lamented that such a beauty died like this, truly a pity.

Ye Chengde asked: "What happened? How did this woman escape?"

Li Xian looked at the lake, not knowing if Bian Qiaoqiao was alive or dead. Qiao San said: "We don't know either. It was just... suddenly we heard she had escaped. Then we chased along the way. She was forced to a dead end and jumped into the lake to commit suicide."

Ye Chengde narrowed his eyes, feeling a bit angry. He said to Li Xian: "Wu Cuo, you have been in close contact with this woman. Have there been any abnormalities recently?"

Li Xian said: "I haven't seen any." Ye Chengde frowned and pondered. His flower boat layout was exquisite and very tight. If he didn't want it, not even a fly could fly out of the cabin. Coincidentally, he was entertaining the Ferryman, drinking and appreciating the lake scenery, neglecting the guard.恰是此时 (at this exact time), Bian Qiaoqiao escaped the cabin. It was too much of a coincidence.

Li Xian said: "Elder Ye... this disciple has been puzzled. These two women are not simple. Why not add more guards to the prison cell?"

Ye Chengde glanced sideways at him, secretly displeased. Such words were blaming him for improper arrangements. But it also reminded him that he was the only one who fully understood the boat's mechanisms. If others wanted to make a move, they would have to suffer greatly.

He thought: "If I investigate this carefully, it's really my fault. I understand the boat's mechanisms and narrow paths deeply. But I was negligent and never expected that at this time, such an accident would happen."

"This woman's fate is like this, it's also helpless. Well, well... such a beautiful woman turned into bones in the lake. Sigh... becoming a beautiful wife to serve us, what's wrong with that?"

He didn't know about Li Xian’s secret operations. Nor did he believe that anyone else could figure out the boat's mechanisms and secret paths. All of this could only be explained by a vague fate.

Ye Chengde felt his face was brushed aside. He thought again: "Although the probability is small, if the other woman also escapes like this, this trip would be too unprofitable. The Ferryman has a high status. I need to serve him well for future promotion. I will inevitably neglect the boat's affairs."

"It is necessary to pick someone to guard that woman. I think this Hua Wu Cuo has quite some ability."

He said: "Wu Cuo, since you proposed this, alright... the remaining woman is handed over to you to guard. In the coming time, you will move to the prison to live. If there is another problem, I will hold you accountable."

Li Xian said: "Elder Ye... can you add two more hands? If that woman knows her companion is dead, she will surely throw a tantrum. I..." Ye Chengde said: "This is your chance to atone for your fault. That woman escaped, you at least bear the charge of negligence. According to the rules, it wouldn't be impossible to punish you with death."

Li Xian said: "Alright, this disciple is willing to accept the punishment."

Li Xian tidied up the room. He carried the bedding and coarse mat to the bottom level and chose a relatively dry place to lay them out.

Nan Gong Liuli was dejected, full of gloom, regretting her loneliness, fearful and helpless. Li Xian lay sideways on the mat, looking at Nan Gong Liuli curiously, feeling very surprised.

He knew that Nan Gong Liuli’s mentality, strength, and strategy... were far superior to Bian Qiaoqiao. He had communicated with Nan Gong Liuli for a long time and originally thought it would be Nan Gong Liuli who took the opportunity to escape.

He never expected... the one who escaped was Bian Qiaoqiao.

Li Xian said leisurely: "Hey. Your sister has caused me a lot of trouble. In the coming days, I will have to take care of you day and night." Nan Gong Liuli was startled, then realized that outside the cell, Li Xian had already laid the coarse mat.

He was lying sideways, looking over quite boldly. He was extremely carefree. Hearing his words, Nan Gong Liuli suddenly felt comforted.

Nan Gong Liuli nodded. Suddenly the boat shook lightly, causing her to sway left and right. She couldn't help but feel very sad. In the past, with such a violent shake, the two women would definitely collide with each other.

Li Xian said: "We've hit a reef. If I'm not mistaken, we should have arrived at the 'Ten Thousand Reef Forest.' In another four or five days, we will enter the Water Altar."

He sighed in his heart: "I... by a twist of fate, have really become a small thief of the Flower Cage Gate. Yue Shan Sword Sect,唉 (sigh), no缘分 (fate) with me. But there is no other way."

He chewed on a grass stalk, his hands behind his head. His posture was relaxed. Since he couldn't resist, he would temporarily obey.

He was bored, so he untied the walnut from Nan Gong Liuli’s mouth. Nan Gong Liuli, to avoid implicating Li Xian, pretended to be disgusted and cursed angrily. She also cried loudly, very realistically.

Li Xian watched the show from the side. He didn't comfort her, occasionally adding a few sarcastic remarks. The acting was very complete.

Nan Gong Liuli knew escape was hopeless. Her expression was low. Li Xian wanted to find some topics to help her adjust her mood.顺便 (by the way) asking about some things he was curious about.

Li Xian said: "Hey. You guys from big families, are you really fed with a golden spoon and clothed in silk?"

Nan Gong Liuli said: "Family disciples also have competition. The纨绔子弟 (playboys) who squander and enjoy have very low-level pleasures. Not what we seek."

Li Xian said: "In your family, how often do you 'raise the tripod'? How are the refined foods distributed?"

Nan Gong Liuli said: "You are interested? I originally wouldn't say this to outsiders. But it's really boring, so it's fine to tell you."

"My Nan Gong family is very large, with many branches. Every month, the branches gather to drink refined treasures. How to distribute... each branch is different. On the day of the seasonal change, all branches gather in the clan hall."

"This month, one can usually get two portions of refined food. The younger generation of the clan is often called to compete. To show off talent and martial arts... those with eloquence and dazzling talent bring glory to their branch. Naturally, resources will be tilted towards them."

Li Xian sighed: "Sigh... I thought family disciples lived such a life. It's really enviable."

Nan Gong Liuli said: "What's enviable about it. Family disputes are constant. When branches gather, one must bring glory to their father. When the clan gathers, one must bring glory to their branch. Layer upon layer of selection and struggle, human relations are complex, relationships are like a tangled ball of yarn."

"To stand out requires a lot of effort."

Li Xian said: "You should be content. Do you know what life we poor and lowly people live?"

Nan Gong Liuli asked curiously: "Tell me." She had gradually calmed down. Li Xian said: "I..." He recounted his past life.

He made some modifications, but the general picture was the same: how he couldn't eat his fill, how his clothes were tattered. When talking about Li Xiaofan, he praised how he was promising... various things.

It was also a rare moment of pouring out his true feelings. Nan Gong Liuli listened to his experiences and couldn't help but fantasize. Li Xian’s words were interesting, able to make things sound dramatic.

She immersed herself in it, sometimes asking questions curiously based on the topic. Sometimes she even asked questions like "Why don't they eat meat?" Li Xian mocked her, then explained the actual situation.

Li Xian said: "Now you know. Although the family has competition, you don't have to worry about refined food. You don't worry about food and clothing."

Nan Gong Liuli thought: "I have reached my current level with the family's support. It seems there is nothing to be proud of. But Hua Wu Cuo, such a person from a poor background, step by step moving forward, fighting for his achievements. That is the most rare."

"I once scolded him, saying he wasn't even worthy to carry shoes for the Heavenly Pride of the Dao Xuan Mountain. But if I put myself in their place, many Heavenly Prides, if they were脱离 (detached) from the support of their families and forces, could they achieve such accomplishments?"

She couldn't help but遐想 (daydream) continuously. She observed Li Xian through the iron bars. Seeing Li Xian’s lying posture was潇洒 (carefree), but the lamplight was dim. He always gave her an unfathomable feeling.

Li Xian said: "By the way. I heard that in the Second Realm of martial arts, the characteristic of the Defiled Garment is very profound? I, this poor and lowly person, am very curious. Can you tell me about it?"

He chattered about this and that, just to ask this topic.

Nan Gong Liuli really didn't mind explaining: "What do you want to know?"

Li Xian smiled: "I want to know everything. Please elaborate."

Nan Gong Liuli was originally very sad. But after Bian Qiaoqiao left, and Li Xian came to talk, she felt much more relaxed. She rolled her eyes lightly and said slowly: "The Defiled Garment is no less than the Ethereal Immortal Melody."

"But the Ethereal Immortal Melody requires collecting musical scores and matching martial arts. The Defiled Garment is Heaven-ordained."

"There are these types of Defiled Garments in the world."
