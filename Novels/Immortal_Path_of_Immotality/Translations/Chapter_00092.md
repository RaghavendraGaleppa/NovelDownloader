# Chapter 92: Race Against Death

All the rogue cultivators at Qi Refining stage present could vaguely sense the impending danger. Naturally, brothers Lin Shan and Lin Fan also detected the deep killing intent brewing within the old monk in the sky.

At this critical moment, Lin Fan stepped forward with remarkable composure befitting a disciple of a major sect. 

"Junior Lin Fan, direct disciple of the Violet Sky Sect, pays respects to the senior!" 

After a slight bow, Lin Fan unhurriedly displayed his sect token from his storage bag and spoke neither arrogantly nor humbly: 

"The ancient treasure map has fallen into my possession. I believe a venerable senior like yourself wouldn't resort to bullying juniors, would you?"

His implication was clear—revealing his background to warn that harming him would bring retribution from his sect. This was precisely why major sects dared to send their low-level disciples out for training.

The Zen Master Xing Tai, who had been about to strike, now found himself in a dilemma. While killing rogue cultivators was one thing, eliminating a direct disciple of the Violet Sky Sect would bring consequences he couldn't handle. 

The entire Great Song territory would become unsafe for him, and the Violet Sky Sect would undoubtedly mobilize its full force to hunt him down. One misstep could mean the end of his cultivation path.

Yet the "Ancient Treasure Map" concerned Zen Sect opportunities that could greatly aid his future cultivation. At over a hundred years old, Zen Master Xing Tai knew that without a breakthrough before his lifespan ran out, he would ultimately return to dust.

The tension in the air was palpable. The cultivators who had earlier cursed the leader for speaking up now secretly rejoiced that a major sect disciple stood between them and the Foundation Establishment cultivator's wrath.

Meanwhile, Lin Shan and Lin Fan exchanged subtle glances, quickly understanding each other's thoughts. If things went south, they needed to be prepared.

...

About the time it takes an incense stick to burn passed, the crowd noticed the gray-robed old monk's dark expression gradually easing, as if he had abandoned his murderous intent. Everyone quietly relaxed, breathing silent sighs of relief.

But in the next instant—

A golden light suddenly emerged from behind the crowd, weaving back and forth as it swiftly harvested lives. The dying cultivators finally recognized it—the golden wheel magic tool previously held by Zen Master Xing Tai.

"Buzz—"

"Ah!"

"Thud! Thud!"

...

As screams erupted around them, the prepared Lin Shan immediately burned his vital essence, summoning wind currents to carry him away at incredible speed.

Lin Fan reacted just as quickly. With a flash of lightning, his figure vanished, leaving only a talisman fluttering in the wind where he'd stood.

---

The murderous Zen Master Xing Tai in the sky showed mild surprise at this development but didn't seem overly concerned, as if confident they couldn't escape. He focused on slaughtering the rogue cultivators below, ensuring no witnesses remained.

The Ancient Treasure Map was non-negotiable today—even at the cost of offending the Violet Sky Sect. If they came after him later, he could always flee overseas or leave Great Song entirely.

Between the Zen Sect's secret treasures and the Violet Sky Sect's pursuit, greed ultimately won out.

...

A quarter hour later, the Lin brothers were aboard a flying vessel—one recuperating from expended vital essence, the other manning the controls in a desperate escape.

Meanwhile, a golden light rapidly closed the distance behind them.

Zen Master Xing Tai stood atop his golden wheel, cutting through clouds like a beam of light that sent flocks of spirit birds scattering.

Lin Fan kept glancing backward while steering the vessel, encouraging his recovering brother: 

"Don't panic. I've planned our escape route. About 800 li ahead lies the Eastern Sea, near Hooked Turtle Island where a senior martial sister from our sect is visiting the island lord."

His expression showed confident calculation as he continued:

"My senior sister, Daoist Thunder Rain, wields dual lightning and water elemental minor supernatural arts and has reached late Foundation Establishment stage. With her here, that so-called Zen Master Xing Tai will be nothing but a paper tiger!"

He amplified his voice with spiritual energy, ensuring the pursuing monk could hear. The message was clear—back off.

But rather than deterred, Zen Master Xing Tai flew into a rage. How dare a mere Qi Refining cultivator call him a paper tiger? 

Very well, today he'd show them who the real paper tiger was!

Having repurposed his golden wheel as a flying device, the monk produced a cylindrical object from his storage bag—a set of interlinked magic tools with golden needles protruding from all sides.

Tossing it overhead, four needles extended into sharp golden spears that shot toward the fleeing vessel. The brothers' faces fell when they noticed the attack.

At this altitude of over a thousand meters, losing their flying vessel would mean certain death from the fall—neither could yet ride magic tools to fly.

Lin Shan abandoned his recovery efforts, shoving Lin Fan aside to seize the controls while muttering curses.

---

"Let me take over! I'll show you what real skill looks like today!"

"Hold on tight!"

Before Lin Fan could react, the vessel spun violently, sending tables and cushions flying. He was tossed about the cabin like a ragdoll, banging into walls until stars filled his vision.

Outside, four golden streaks shot past as the vessel weaved, rolled, and dodged with astonishing agility.

Zen Master Xing Tai gaped—he'd never seen a flying vessel maneuvered so spectacularly!

Hastily forming hand seals, he redirected the needles for another pass. But under Lin Shan's masterful control, the vessel zigzagged unpredictably like a slippery loach, even managing to gain some distance.

From the ground, observers would see an elegant green vessel dancing through the sky, gracefully evading golden projectiles while leaving its pursuer choking on exhaust fumes.

A wind-aligned cultivator piloting a high-grade wind-aligned flying vessel proved a perfect match!

Inside, Lin Fan gradually adapted to the wild ride and suppressed his nausea. Seeing the monk's disheveled pursuit, he couldn't help laughing.

Since the old monk clearly wouldn't let them go, he might as well taunt him.

"You call yourself Foundation Establishment? You call this bullying juniors? Try being arrogant now—all you'll get is our exhaust!"

While Lin Fan enjoyed his moment, Lin Shan at the controls felt his heart clench.

Brother, is this really the time to provoke him? Are you trying to make this more difficult?

Zen Master Xing Tai, already irritated by the exhaust fumes, grew livid at the mockery.

"Very well! Since you youngsters insist on being insolent, you've forced my hand!"
