Chapter 296: Teaching the Clan Technique, Brewing a Grand Battle

Li Xian frowned, immediately sensing the visitor harbored ill intent. He ascended to the pavilion of his residence and used his Heavy Pupils to peer through the walls, observing the mysterious woman by the side gate.

She was draped in a black robe, her face hidden. However, under the透视 of his Heavy Pupils, he saw through the clothing to reveal a face marred by burns, terrifying to behold.

"Her face is burned, and she is a woman. Is she Zeng Xiaoke, the disciple of Hao Qingshe? Has her injury healed, so she has come here for revenge?"

Li Xian had not forgotten their past grievances and remained vigilant at all times. Zeng Xiaoke's martial arts and poison skills were average; she posed little threat to Li Xian. What he feared was Hao Qingshe making a move. That was precisely why he had joined the Candle Cult. Seeing Zeng Xiaoke reappear, he thought it was time to settle the score.

He did not know that Zeng Xiaoke was already dead, and the skin she wore belonged to another: Zhao Lei, a rather formidable disciple of Hao Qingshe.

This matter must be traced back to half a month ago.

Zhao Lei returned to the Water Altar Island on Tang Feng's flower boat. That day happened to be when Li Xian was suppressing the water bandits, bringing hundreds of bandit leaders back to the island, surrounded by people praising him. Zhao Lei noticed Li Xian then. Hearing the surrounding praise, exaggerated to the extreme, she felt nothing but disdain. Taught by Hao Qingshe, she looked down on her fellow disciples. Hearing them praise "the might of killing bandits," she thought it was making a mountain out of a molehill.

She could easily achieve the same using her poison arts.

Upon returning to the island, her first order of business was to pay respects to her master. Hao Qingshe had a perverse temperament and was practicing her poison arts. Seeing her return, she paid little attention. She had actually forgotten the matter of the duel with "Hua Wucuo" and "Zeng Xiaoke."

Days passed in this manner.

Until noon yesterday, Zhao Lei saw a skin suit hanging outside the residence. Curious, she asked, "Master, have you been concocting new poisons recently? What is the use of this skin suit?"

Hao Qingshe stared at the skin suit for a few moments, frowned slightly, and thought for a moment before recalling the matter. "I forgot about this," she said.

She smiled and asked, "Good disciple, someone has humiliated me. What would you do?"

Zhao Lei said, "Kill them and be done with it."

Hao Qingshe shook her head. "That is too easy. Think of a crueler method."

Zhao Lei said cruelly, "How about turning them into a 'human vessel'?"

Hao Qingshe laughed. "That is acceptable." Hao Qingshe's methods were vicious, and her personality was extremely unlikable. Chu Liu Qing'an had lived on the island for over a month. Knowing Hao Qingshe was also on the island and part of the Candle Cult remnants, she had never visited or spoken to her because she disliked her temperament.

所谓 "Human Vessel" meant using a human as a vessel to cultivate poisonous insects and beasts. They would endure the torment of being devoured by thousands of insects daily, suffering pain worse than death.

Hao Qingshe then recounted the events of the bet and the duel. "That boy does have some ability. He spits out white mist, and ordinary poisons can't touch him. Do you have the confidence to handle him?"

Zhao Lei felt immense disdain. She already knew that "Hua Wucuo" was her enemy. She said arrogantly, "It is as easy for me to crush him as squashing a bug. Master, please rest assured. Leave the arrangements to me. I will make him suffer a fate worse than death."

"This boy is currently at the height of his fame and has attracted quite a bit of attention. If I defeat him now, it will also spread Master's prestige."

Hao Qingshe said, "Hmph, do I care about the reputation of the Flower Cage Sect? A group of lowly flower thieves. They say evil needs evil to tame them. I am more evil than them. Catching them to mix poisons and test toxicity is the best course of action."

"I wanted to kill him that day; it wasn't a big deal. But that old fool Shi and the useless Yan interfered several times. Who Hao Qingshe wants to kill, the more they interfere, the more I want to kill. I failed to kill him last time, but this time, I will kill him right in front of them!"

Zhao Lei smiled and added, "Master, you are mistaken. We aren't just going to kill him, but turn him into a human vessel. Master, leave this to me, and I will handle it perfectly. In the duel, I will first break his limbs, cut out his tongue, but leave him alive for Master to cultivate poisonous insects."

Hao Qingshe said, "Good, good. Zhao Lei, you handle matters thoroughly and are very much to my liking."

"Since you have returned, I have let that little thief live for over a month. It is time to fulfill the duel."

She immediately wrote a letter to Shi Yufei, limiting him to arrange the matter within ten days. Moreover, it had to be grand and known to all, with a scale far exceeding a "grand meeting," to vent her hatred. This hatred stemmed from Shi Yufei and Yan Hao, but was directed at Li Xian. Thus, the letter emphasized the "scale of the duel" to humiliate the two of them.

Zhao Lei put on the "Zeng Xiaoke" skin suit and prepared for the "duel." She practiced "poison arts," often accompanied by pain, twisting her mind. She enjoyed watching people writhe in agony from poison, begging on their knees for mercy.

Only then was the suffering of practicing poison arts not in vain. Since she viewed Li Xian as an enemy, recalling the scene that day, seeing him surrounded by people, her arrogance flared, and disdain grew. She thought the disciples of the Flower Cage Sect were all worthless trash. The person supported by such trash must also be trash. Although she had no grudge against Li Xian and had never even met him, she felt quite annoyed.

So she found a reason to provoke him. First, she inquired about Li Xian's residence. The duel was still ten days away, but she felt an itch to fight. She knew there was a beautiful woman in Li Xian's house.

She inherited Hao Qingshe's viciousness and cunning. She wanted to first subtly apply poison and silently kill the beauty. Since the poison duel was still ten days away, she intended to use "Ten-Day Butterfly Powder." The poison's name was quite elegant, but its effect was chilling.

Vomit blood on the first day, white hair on the second, withered appearance on the third, broken fingers on the fourth, blindness on the fifth, teeth falling out on the sixth... Over ten days, she would endure all kinds of suffering, torturing the person to a fate worse than death, completely destroying their appearance.

Torturing their mind, and then striking a heavy blow at the duel. Only then would it be satisfying.

She knew Li Xian would go out during the day, so she特意 came during the day to wait outside the door and observe. She thought, "This Hua Wucuo should be defeated at the duel. It wouldn't be fun if he were poisoned now."

She would wait for Li Xian to leave before making her move, sending the poison powder into the residence.

Who knew Li Xian had sharp senses. She had just arrived at the door and was already detected. Li Xian guessed this woman was a master of poison. Although he had defeated her once, he could not be careless.

"If she intends to use poison to harm me, on the day of the duel, I must kill her to eliminate future troubles."

As Li Xian pondered, he observed Zhao Lei's movements. Seeing her hiding in the shadows, waiting for a long time. She neither applied poison nor sneaked in; her behavior was very strange.

Li Xian suddenly thought, "I should take the initiative to attack. That Hao Qingshe is extremely vicious. Even if I win the duel, she will never let it go. If I follow the rules too strictly, I will always be the one to suffer."

A fierce light flashed in his eyes. This woman was skilled at using poison. Since she was lurking near his residence, her intentions were certainly malicious! Since that was the case, it was better to strike first. Li Xian left through another door, his figure silently concealed. He quietly approached the poison woman and suddenly shouted, "Who dares to launch a sneak attack?"

At the same time, he struck a fierce palm, its momentum terrifying, mixed with a powerful killing intent.

Zhao Lei was startled. She was focusing intently on the side gate. Hearing the sudden shout, she didn't understand but felt the aura wave crashing towards her. She was shocked and immediately raised her palm to defend, colliding with the opponent's palm.

"Boom!" Zhao Lei's body trembled violently. The bricks under her feet cracked and shattered. Her sleeves tore with a "rip" sound, turning into dust.

Her arm skin was exposed.

The wall behind her shook, and the vermilion paint flaked off. The pedestrians nearby immediately retreated, looking at the scene in panic. Vendors, carriages, vegetable stalls... all fell into chaos. When Li Xian struck, he had already dispersed the residual force, blasting the surrounding pedestrians several zhang away. Although they inevitably suffered some injuries, they were spared from the aftermath.

Zhao Lei's arms went numb. She was both shocked and confused. She had clearly seen Li Xian's face, and her eyes narrowed instantly. Li Xian was also surprised. This palm contained killing intent. Although he didn't use his full strength, he aimed for a one-hit kill. Even if he was in the wrong, he had to eliminate future troubles! Zeng Xiaoke's poison skills were strong, but her martial arts were average. Close combat was her weakness. She would find it very difficult to block this palm.

However... at this moment of palm collision, the opponent's internal energy was thick and powerful, and her palm technique was overwhelmingly strong. It was absolutely not something Zeng Xiaoke could do. Li Xian thought:

"Could it be that in these past few months, Zeng Xiaoke's strength has skyrocketed? No... that is very unlikely, but she is indeed much stronger."

The two palms met for a moment. Zhao Lei lost the initiative and was shaken to the point where her breath became erratic. She had no choice but to retreat several steps. Li Xian shouted, "Why did you sneak attack me!" Seizing the initiative, he executed the "Blue Waves Soaring the Skies" move from the "Blue Silk Palm."

Zhao Lei was speechless with anger. Hearing the words "Why did you sneak attack me," she felt even more wronged and resentful.

She cursed in her heart, "Good, this小子 discovered me, struck first, and then deliberately said I sneak attacked."

Although she did intend to launch a sneak attack, she hadn't actually done it yet. Being wronged like this made her feel very irritated. But as Li Xian's palm force came at her, she immediately channeled her internal energy to resist.

Li Xian struck his second palm, his mind already extremely alert. This woman's strength was quite formidable. Her palm force had increased several times. The moment she struck, a "buzzing" sound could be heard in the ear, showing its terrifying power.

Zhao Lei saw this and actually had no intention of retreating. Her eyes were filled with ruthlessness. She immediately raised her palm to fight head-on. She was also extremely confident in her own martial arts.

Just as the two palms were about to collide and decide the winner, a rustling sound was heard.

Two flying leaves shot fiercely towards Li Xian and Zhao Lei respectively. Li Xian's palm force dissipated. He turned around, caught the leaf, and retreated three steps. Zhao Lei snorted coldly and struck sideways at the leaf, turning it into flying dust that scattered all over the ground.

Li Xian frowned slightly and thought, "This palm energy contains a powerful twisting force. This woman is definitely not Zeng Xiaoke!"

Two figures landed nearby.

It was Shi Yufei and Tang Feng.

Li Xian said, "Master Shi!" Zhao Lei also bowed in greeting.

Shi Yufei said sternly, "What happened? Why are you fighting in the streets? Such a battle, what if you hurt innocent people?"

Li Xian said, "Disciple had no choice. This woman suddenly attacked, so I had to defend myself."

Zhao Lei looked over coldly and said淡淡, "Master, please investigate clearly. This小子 suddenly attacked, and I had no choice but to defend myself." She cupped her hands and said, "Master Shi, if you don't believe me, the neighbors all saw it. You can ask them."

Li Xian sneered, "This姑娘 has such a sharp tongue and such meticulous thinking. It seems you came prepared."

"We martial artists exchange moves. Can ordinary people see the details? This is my residence. If you weren't sneaking an attack on me, why would you be here?"

"You launched a sneak attack with a hidden move first. I returned with an open move. How could the neighbors see the details?"

Zhao Lei's eyes narrowed, emitting killing intent. She sneered, "Sharp tongue. Your martial arts are average, but your tongue is powerful." Feeling that explanation was useless, and not fearing reprimand, she sneered and fell silent. She just stared at Li Xian, emitting a cold, chilling aura.

Shi Yufei looked淡淡 at Zhao Lei and said, "There are still ten days until the duel. What do you mean by coming here now?"

Tang Feng said, "Hua Wucuo is right. You lurking near someone's residence must be with ill intent. It is highly possible you wanted to secretly use poison. According to the Flower Cage Sect rules, those who act recklessly at the Water Altar and disturb the people must be severely punished."

Zhao Lei淡淡 said, "So Elder Tang wants to take this opportunity to punish me. I need to inform my master and let her decide. If my master were here and Elder Tang insisted on punishing me, then please do as you please."

Tang Feng was furious, "You are a disciple of the Flower Cage Sect. If you are wrong, I have the right to punish you."

Zhao Lei paid no attention, not putting Tang Feng in her eyes. Tang Feng was enraged and raised his palm to grab her shoulder.

Suddenly, he saw something wriggling under the clothes on her shoulder, as if hiding a poisonous creature. If he struck down, he would certainly kill the creature, but if poisonous blood stained his palm, it would be extremely bad. So he immediately changed his palm force and struck elsewhere.

A yellow-green centipede crawled out of Zhao Lei's shoulder. It had three wings on its back and suddenly flew to bite Tang Feng.

Just then, Shi Yufei raised his palm and pulled Tang Feng back to his side. Zhao Lei also called back the yellow-green centipede, provokingly looking at Tang Feng. She had triangular eyes, looking at people with a cold, gloomy gaze.

Shi Yufei said, "I'll let you go this time. The duel has been set. In ten days, success or failure will be clear. If you dare come here again, I will definitely strike you dead! Don't play tricks in front of me. Your master killed disciples of my Flower Cage Sect. I considered other factors and didn't追究. Therefore, if I strike you dead, your master won't追究 me for it."

Zhao Lei dared not defy Shi Yufei. Extremely angry, she vented her anger on Li Xian. She said arrogantly, "So Master Shi is biased. The duel hasn't even started, and you are already standing by this flower thief."

Shi Yufei said coldly, "If I were truly biased, I would have sent you to the West right now, you little poison brat."

Zhao Lei smiled and shook her head. She turned to look at Li Xian, her killing intent chilling. "Very well, we will see in ten days. You launched a sneak attack on me today, counting it as you gaining a slight advantage. Ten days later... on the stage, I will make you pay a painful price for today's actions."

She smiled again and said, "Even if Master Shi is biased, it's fine. But there is one thing I need to remind you. My master said that the duel in ten days must be arranged with great fanfare. Her temperament is eccentric. If it doesn't meet her expectations and she causes a scene, Master Shi will surely have a headache."

"Be sure, be sure, the more grand, the better."

Shi Yufei's expression remained calm. Tang Feng almost made a move.

Zhao Lei turned to leave. Li Xian said calmly, "Idle chatter is useless. There is one thing I must tell you. Ten days later, I will kill you."

Zhao Lei stopped and sneered, "Kill me? With your ability?" Her body was as light as a swallow, leaping several zhang high, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Li Xian expression was calm. When he sneaked close, he originally thought "Zeng Xiaoke" was easy to deal with. Although his killing intent was fierce, he held back his palm force, fearing blood and flesh would fly everywhere, scaring the common people, or poisonous gas would drift and kill innocents. With many concerns, although he had the upper hand in the first palm, he failed to kill her.

The second palm had used thirty percent of his strength. Knowing Zeng Xiaoke was skilled at using poison, he was on guard and wanted to test her first. Who knew Shi Yufei and Tang Feng would arrive. He neither killed her nor knew Zhao Lei's true strength.

But he had a rough estimate: her strength was quite formidable, definitely not a weakling. And judging by her words and actions, she was full of confidence. In the stage duel, he could not be careless.

Conversely.

Zhao Lei had a brief exchange with Li Xian. Although she was shocked by his immense power, the exchange was too short to know Li Xian's true strength. Judging only by the first palm force, he was just a brute. Killing him would be no trouble. Zhao Lei had an unreasonable arrogance since birth. As a woman, she looked down on men. As a mortal, she looked down on martial artists who consumed essence. She despised those above her, scorned those at her level, and disdained those below her.

But her opportunities were good, and her strength grew deeper. This unreasonable arrogance accumulated in her chest. Now at the Second Realm of martial arts, relying on her exquisite poison arts, she disdained the First Realm and mortals, scorned the Second Realm, and looked down on the Third Realm.

Qing Niu Residence.

Courtyard.

Shi Yufei stroked his beard and smiled, very pleased. He saw the residence had been completely renewed, a world apart from his last visit. The yellow mud courtyard had become refined and elegant, with flowing water, green scenery, and bright red flowers.

He thought Li Xian had taken his words to heart. He felt the child was teachable, both touched and surprised. He said, "Tang Feng, how is this residence?"

Tang Feng nodded, "Not bad, not bad. Eh, that's a clam shell. You have one too?"

Shi Yufei laughed, "If I'm not mistaken, this is Zisha's clam shell. How did it get to you? Ah, I heard you've been getting close to that girl recently. Could it be you and her... That girl, although she has flaws, also has strengths." His expression was teasing.

Tang Feng raised his eyebrows and looked over. Li Xian said, "Master Shi, I bought it from Elder Han. It cost a thousand taels of silver."

Shi Yufei said, "That girl Han isn't very honest then. She's used it for years, the clam oil has been boiled dry. How is it worth a thousand taels?"

Tang Feng patted Li Xian's shoulder and laughed, "She quoted seven hundred taels last time. I didn't buy it. She finally found a sucker like you!" Li Xian said, "I naturally know Elder Han would trick this傻小子. But working with people, suffering a small loss, is fine."

Shi Yufei and Tang Feng both nodded, quite agreeing. Shi Yufei said, "Wucuo is young but has a big格局. Rare, very rare." Tang Feng smiled, "Brother Hua, if you have time in the future, let's go flower-picking together."

Li Xian smiled and agreed. The three sat in the stone pavilion by the pool. Li Xian brewed and poured tea. Shi Yufei took a sip and got to the point. "Do you know why I came today?"

Li Xian said, "Is it about the duel?"

Shi Yufei said, "Correct. Last night, Hao Qingshe sent a letter. asked me to arrange the duel. She will attend in person to watch the match."

As he spoke, he handed the letter to Li Xian. Li Xian skimmed it and sighed, "Wucuo is a nobody. I really don't know why Senior Qingshe is so concerned?"

Shi Yufei said, "Hao Qingshe has an eccentric temperament. Her actions are hard to predict. But this matter is both good and bad."

"Judging by my understanding of her, she might have forgotten about this matter. If she never remembered, it would be fine. I'm afraid she will suddenly remember and make a move against you. Then you would die without knowing why."

"She hasn't forgotten, so we can truly settle this matter. It's better than being targeted and living in constant fear."

Li Xian said, "Master Shi, that Zeng Xiaoke is definitely not the original Zeng Xiaoke. Does Senior Qingshe have any disciples with a burned face?"

Shi Yufei said, "She is indeed not Zeng Xiaoke. I didn't point it out because Hao Qingshe's temperament is eccentric. If I pointed it out, who knows what else might happen."

"Wucuo, you will have to suffer a bit for this matter. Do you have the confidence to defeat that woman?"

Li Xian said confidently, "I do." He thought, "In a life-and-death battle against an enemy, one must advance without hesitation. Excessive modesty only dampens one's own spirit. Hmph, that woman is extremely arrogant. How can I tolerate her?"

Sharp intent radiated from him. Tang Feng was impressed when he first met Li Xian. Upon meeting him again, he was even more moved and nodded repeatedly. He said, "That's right, Master Shi... Since that woman is an impostor, why didn't you let me teach her a lesson just now?"

Shi Yufei said, "You... usually very cautious, but you were careless just now. If I hadn't pulled you back, you would have been in trouble. That yellow-green centipede is extremely dangerous. If you touched it, you would have had a hard time."

"That is a Three-Winged Red-Headed Centipede. It is very small, has potent poison, and can penetrate stone and spread toxins. I saw you were about to use 'Heavy Rock Technique' to block it. This martial art makes your body as solid as layers of rock. But it is exactly克制 by this poisonous creature."

Tang Feng felt a lingering fear. "So that's how it is."

Shi Yufei said, "It's not your fault. This poisonous creature is extremely rare. You need to practice the 'Centipede Poison Scripture' to cultivate it. This centipede has three wings, showing this woman has reached the third level of the Centipede Poison Scripture. She is so arrogant, even looking down on elders, because she has some backing."

He said solemnly, "This woman is very strong. Even if you have confidence, you must be extremely cautious." Li Xian nodded, not being careless.

Shi Yufei and Tang Feng sat for a while longer, finished their tea, and left.

Tang Feng said, "Master Shi, that Hao Qingshe has no position in the Flower Cage Sect and doesn't handle affairs. What reason does she have to order the Master to do things?"

Shi Yufei pondered. According to the Flower Cage Sect rules, Hao Qingshe could not order him. According to the Candle Cult rules, Hao Qingshe could not order Shi Yufei either. But because Shi Yufei came from the Flower Cage Sect, his status was slightly lower. Her ordering him around did seem somewhat reasonable.

Shi Yufei sneered, "Let's do as she says. If she wants it grand, I will help her make it grand. Hmph, the people from the Earth Altar will also arrive at the Water Altar soon. I will make this match big. Let's see who loses face." He thought, "Wucuo has always been calm. His temperament and ability have been verified. If he says he can win, I believe he can win!"

Nangong Liuli looked over with concern. She had heard everything that just happened. During the "Grand Duel," she was also present and witnessed the whole thing. After Shi Yufei and Tang Feng left, she immediately walked over and said, "Brother Wucuo, do you really have the confidence?"

Li Xian said solemnly, "I naturally have confidence." He was usually modest, but when it came to fighting and killing, he must first hold the belief of victory. Otherwise, his daily hard training would be wasted.

Nangong Liuli said, "If you have confidence, that's good." Li Xian smiled, "Good sister, do you have some secret technique to teach me?"

Nangong Liuli showed hesitation. She saw Li Xian repeatedly encountering dangerous enemies. She and Li Xian had cooperated sincerely and were in the same situation. She hoped Li Xian would win completely and remain unharmed. But her family's martial arts, passed down through generations, could not be taught to others lightly. It was hard to overcome this barrier in her heart.

She paced back and forth, her heart in turmoil.

She looked at Li Xian again, biting her red lips. She actually wanted Li Xian to be bad and tie her up for interrogation. If she were forced to reveal her martial arts, it wouldn't count as her teaching it voluntarily. She hesitated for a moment and made a firm decision: "Those who use poison must be extremely guarded against. Such martial artists are extremely dangerous. If Brother Wucuo suffers the slightest accident, I would surely regret it immensely. Even if it violates the clan rules, I must help him."

She said firmly, "To be safe, I will teach you some clan techniques. They can counter poison arts. You must practice diligently and not fall victim to that vicious woman."
