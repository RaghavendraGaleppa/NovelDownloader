# Chapter 34: Taking It for Himself  

Zhou Qing stopped Miss Lin from helping him obtain the five-leaf ginseng from the Fierce Tiger Gang—he intended to take it himself.  

After all, Butcher Hu's medical expenses were anything but cheap. The compensation the Zhang family had sent through Wang Hai was far from enough. Thus, Zhou Qing had to visit the Fierce Tiger Gang to collect the remaining medical fees—with interest.  

However, he wasn’t planning to go today.  

He still needed to make some preparations.  

It was time to advance the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* to the "Proficient" stage.  

While the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* overlapped in some effects with the Crane Form Technique and the Tiger-Crane Twin Fists, its lethality paled in comparison to the latter.  

Thus, in recent days, Zhou Qing had focused entirely on breaking through with the Tiger-Crane Twin Fists, temporarily setting aside the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual*.  

Now that the Tiger-Crane Twin Fists had reached mastery, elevating the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* from "Skilled" to "Proficient" was a natural progression.  

The *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* had a unique feature: when applied to the Deer Play, the resulting "Deer Run" granted stealth and concealment effects.  

In forests, under the cover of night, or amidst complex terrain, the stealth effect of Deer Run could be maximized.  

If Zhou Qing intended to take the spirit ginseng from the Fierce Tiger Gang, Deer Run, enhanced by the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual*, would be his best tool.  

But he wasn’t planning to head straight for the gang after mastering Deer Run.  

First, he would practice in less dangerous areas at night, gradually increasing the difficulty—perhaps even testing his skills at the Lin residence.  

The Lin family’s security was far stricter than the Fierce Tiger Gang’s. If Zhou Qing could move freely within their estate, he’d have a much higher chance of success in retrieving the ginseng.  

With the provincial exams still months away, practicing stealth techniques would also prove useful in case of emergencies during his journey. If he encountered an unavoidable threat, this skill could serve as a life-saving trump card.  

Moreover, traveling to Changzhou required only a two-week head start, leaving him ample time.  

As for the exam registration, the Lin family had already helped him complete all the necessary procedures.  

Of course, even if he practiced Deer Run at the Lin residence, he wouldn’t venture into the inner courtyard.  

The inner courtyard was primarily occupied by women, and aside from its high walls, its defenses were actually weaker than the outer courtyard. If he were caught sneaking in, it would be impossible to explain.  

If he were discovered in the outer courtyard, however, it wouldn’t be as problematic—after all, it was staffed by male servants and guards. He could simply explain his intentions to Old Master Lin and Miss Lin.  

Miss Lin already knew he practiced martial arts, though she had never openly acknowledged it. Besides, he had also trained in the *Huichun Talisman Manual* from the Qingfu Temple, which she was aware of.  

This exercise would also help him gauge his current abilities.  

To avoid misunderstandings, Zhou Qing planned to send a letter explaining his intentions to Old Master Lin before testing his skills at the Lin residence.  

This would also serve as a demonstration of his capabilities.  

Even if he failed the provincial exams, he would still be a valuable partner for the Lin family.  

Before mastering the Tiger-Crane Twin Fists, he hadn’t had the leverage to make such a move. Now, he could afford to test the waters.  

As for whether Old Master Lin would tacitly approve of this simulated test—  

From a human perspective, the Lin family had already invested heavily in Zhou Qing. It was only natural for Old Master Lin to go along with it.  

Zhou Qing recalled a story from his past life. His mentor had a friend who owed the bank hundreds of millions. Instead of pressuring him to repay, the bank actively helped him find new projects and even loaned him more money—eventually allowing him to turn his fortunes around.  

When Zhou Qing first heard this, he was stunned. But after his mentor analyzed the situation from various angles—human nature, societal dynamics—he realized that what initially seemed absurd was actually quite logical.  

Back in his courtyard, Zhou Qing cleared out a storage room and placed a large water vat inside, nearly filled to the brim.  

On windless nights, he would leap onto the vat and practice Deer Play and the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual*.  

After each session, he observed the ripples in the water to gauge his progress.  

The smaller the ripples, the better his control.  

Practicing atop the vat also improved his balance.  

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.  

Since mastering the Tiger-Crane Twin Fists, Zhou Qing found his training in Deer Play and the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* remarkably smooth.  

Though Deer Play and the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* didn’t display the same "+" symbol as Tiger Play and the Crane Form Technique—indicating they could be fused using *Yang Sheng Zhu*—Zhou Qing naturally integrated them.  

The resulting Deer Run, embodying the fusion of both techniques, grew increasingly potent.  

Strangely, Deer Run never appeared in *Yang Sheng Zhu*’s evaluations. Yet, Zhou Qing felt an instinctive sense that a new martial skill was budding within him—an intuition conveyed by *Yang Sheng Zhu*.  

Moreover, within ten days, the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* advanced to "Proficient" without any hindrance, as if it were the most natural progression.  

The Tiger-Crane Twin Fists had clearly played a significant role. Martial techniques were evidently interconnected, not isolated.  

Now, if Zhou Qing were to practice a move like "Black Tiger Seizes the Heart," his progress would be incomparable to before.  

---  

Over the following month, Zhou Qing tested Deer Run’s stealth effects in various locations at night.  

Though Deer Play had reached "Proficient," the heat generated during practice quickly dissipated into his liver—a hallmark of the technique at this stage.  

Previously, as long as he wasn’t overly fatigued, the heat from Deer Play would flow into his liver—especially after he began accumulating heat from Tiger Play.  

Now that Tiger Play’s heat had merged with Crane Force to form Tiger-Crane Force, Deer Play’s heat consistently nourished his liver.  

This continuous reinforcement of his liver had obvious benefits for his blood and vitality.  

"A strong liver sharpens the eyes."  

With his enhanced vision, Zhou Qing could spot patrolling guards and night watchmen from a distance. In this world, night blindness was common, and even guards and watchmen had limited night vision.  

Deer Run, combined with the cold, drizzling winter rains of Jiangzhou, made Zhou Qing feel like a fish in water—effortlessly blending into the night.  

A month later, Zhou Qing had successfully infiltrated numerous locations without a single misstep, thanks to his meticulous caution.  

During this time, he and Old Master Lin Tai conducted a tacit test—Zhou Qing moved freely through the Lin family’s outer residence, with the night as his perfect cover.  

"It’s time."  

Over the past month, Zhou Qing had also dabbled in Bear Play and Bird Play. Without the aid of Blood Qi Pills, however, progress was agonizingly slow.  

Bear Play alone would take at least a year to reach "Proficient," while Bird Play—due to its similarity to the Crane Form Technique—would require at least six months.  

With Blood Qi Pills, he estimated he could master Bird Play and bring Bear Play to "Skilled" before the provincial exams—possibly even nurturing the martial skill derived from Deer Play and the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual*.  

He wasn’t sure what criteria *Yang Sheng Zhu* used to classify martial skills. Moves like "Flicking Finger Projectile" and "Black Tiger Seizes the Heart" had relatively low thresholds.  

Perhaps Deer Run was merely the embryonic form of the skill, not yet fully developed?  

Whatever the case, Zhou Qing was eager to see what this Deer Play-based skill would become—a leg technique, a movement skill, or both?  

"First fists, then legs."  

The Tiger-Crane Twin Fists had already exceeded his expectations. What surprises would this leg-focused skill bring?  

"Time to take that five-leaf ginseng!"  

After countless nights of practice and reconnaissance—even scouting the Fierce Tiger Gang’s vicinity by day—Zhou Qing had gathered valuable intelligence.  

The gang was struggling under the new prefect’s crackdown. Without the Zhang family’s support, their situation was dire, and morale was low.  

But this was temporary. Rumor had it that Chen Hu, the gang’s leader, had been frequenting the Golden Light Temple, possibly seeking to become a lay disciple and transform the gang into the temple’s outer faction.  

If successful, the prefect’s suppression would likely cease—after all, the crackdown was merely a political maneuver.  

Everything was in place.  

Zhou Qing chose a moonless, windy night for his operation.  

He had learned that the ginseng was stored in the gang’s treasury.  

With Deer Run’s near-silent movement and the cover of darkness, he slipped into the treasury like a shadow.  

Picking locks was a skill Zhou Qing had learned from ancient texts. Using his left hand’s dexterity, he effortlessly opened the complex lock—its faint clicks masked by the wind.  

The guards were huddled in a side room, warming themselves by a fire.  

Zhou Qing vanished into the treasury.  

Moments later, he emerged. But as he scaled the outer wall and landed in an alley, a burly figure appeared at the far end.  

"Which path do you walk, brother? Impressive skills—I wouldn’t have noticed you if I hadn’t stepped out for air."  

Zhou Qing coughed lightly.  

The man approached—  

Then clutched his chest in shock.  

A crossbow bolt had pierced his lung, silencing him. Before he could react, an iron pellet struck his nose, followed by three devastating punches to his temples.  

The sudden, brutal assault left the gang member unable to cry out. The howling wind drowned out the sounds of impact.  

Without hesitation, Zhou Qing retrieved the pellet, withdrew the bolt, and stabbed it into the man’s heart—ensuring his death. Then he vanished into the night.  

As he had predicted, rain began to fall.  

Back in his courtyard, under the glow of an oil lamp, the five-leaf ginseng lay wrapped in silk on his table.  

This was his second kill.  

Fearing the man might wear armor, Zhou Qing had aimed for the lungs. Even with his confidence in his accuracy, the chest was a surer target than the head or neck.  

At close range, the crossbow’s power ensured immediate incapacitation—making the rest effortless.  

A direct confrontation had never been part of his plan.  

For now, the crossbow remained his most effective weapon—surpassing even his perfected "Flicking Finger Projectile" and Tiger-Crane Twin Fists.  

The gang member’s strength might have rivaled the monk’s, but Zhou Qing had no intention of testing it.  

This was Zhou Qing’s first meticulously planned operation in this world—and it had gone smoothly.  

Though a minor hiccup had occurred, it was inconsequential.  

No plan was foolproof. The true test lay in handling unexpected complications—and Zhou Qing was satisfied with his performance.  

He reminded himself that this was a world of survival of the fittest, fraught with unpredictable dangers. Hesitation or mercy could be fatal.  

But overcoming these challenges promised great rewards.  

With the five-leaf ginseng, he could now refine more Blood Qi Pills.  

While these pills were invaluable to martial artists, Zhou Qing’s current status prevented him from leveraging them for profit.  

The Zhang family’s greed over Five Fragrance Pills was proof enough—if word of Blood Qi Pills got out, the consequences would be dire.  

Only after passing the provincial exams could he consider trading pills for resources.  

The gang member and the monk had taught him a harsh lesson: without resilience, even the strongest fighter could be crippled by a single ambush.  

In moments of severe injury, the body often refused to obey.  

Perhaps they could recover in a breath or two—but would their assailant allow it?  

Zhou Qing certainly wouldn’t.  

If he could eliminate threats this way, he could also fall victim to similar tactics.  

The road to the provincial exams would likely be treacherous.  

Bear Play’s defensive prowess was essential—another reason he needed the ginseng.  

Some risks were worth taking.  

His reluctance to rely too heavily on the Lin family had driven this operation.  

After lying low for so long, it was time to show results.  

Suppressing his thoughts, Zhou Qing focused on the ginseng, its surface glimmering faintly in the lamplight.  

"Now, it’s up to you."  

He murmured softly.  

Forward—  

Ever forward.
