Chapter 4: Telekinesis

The ice blade cut into his skin, causing unbearable pain. Lin Xuan's head was covered in cold sweat, which quickly froze. Despite the agony, he continued to cultivate, gritting his teeth to endure the suffering.

In the sky, numerous light dots danced, representing the spiritual energy. Usually, cultivators couldn't see these dots, but when the energy became pure enough, they could sense it. Lin Xuan's task was to absorb these energy dots into his body, making it easier to refine them into magical power.

Since he could see the energy dots, absorbing them wasn't difficult, but it required him to withstand the pain of the ice blade piercing his body. One by one, the energy dots were absorbed, and according to his sect's teachings, he incorporated them into his dantian, forming a cluster of spiritual energy.

Next, he needed to refine this energy. The cluster rotated in his dantian, shrinking in size but becoming more concentrated. Finally, it transformed into a strand of spiritual force, dispersing throughout his dantian.

Lin Xuan's endurance had reached its limit. He quickly retreated from the illusionary realm, collapsing to the ground, gasping for breath. He didn't even want to move a finger.

This process repeated itself for several hours, until nightfall, when Lin Xuan exited the refining path. As he walked away, he overheard some disciples discussing him.

"Did you hear that the disciple without a spiritual root went to the refining path?" one of them said.

"Yes, Ma Shishu saw it with his own eyes," another replied.

"Humph, even with determination, an ordinary person is destined to achieve nothing in the cultivation world. They're just trash!"

Lin Xuan frowned but didn't get angry. He knew that, in the cultivation world, respect was earned through strength alone. It was pointless to get worked up over others' opinions. Instead, he returned to his residence, took out a paper with cultivation methods, and began to practice the Telekinesis technique.

Telekinesis was a fundamental yet crucial spell in the cultivation world, allowing practitioners to drive objects with their spiritual force. It was the foundation for using magical artifacts, although such artifacts were still beyond Lin Xuan's current capabilities. He focused on practicing the technique, using his spiritual energy to concentrate his mind and attach his consciousness to an object, making it move.

For the entire afternoon, Lin Xuan practiced the Telekinesis technique repeatedly. Previously, he had tried but failed. Now, with his enhanced spiritual force, he attempted it again. Hours passed, and Lin Xuan's eyes grew tired, but he continued.

Suddenly, the cup in front of him moved slightly. Although the movement was minimal, it was a sign of progress. Lin Xuan didn't stop; he continued to practice, refining his technique until late at night, when he finally rested.

The next day, Lin Xuan returned to the refining path, facing a new illusionary realm filled with mist and ghostly figures. Countless malevolent spirits charged towards him, but he remained unfazed. His time in the refining path had not only strengthened his spiritual force but also tempered his will and increased his endurance.

As he progressed, Lin Xuan absorbed spiritual energy, refining it and circulating it through his meridians. He performed the Grand Celestial Cycle nine times, pushing his body to its limits. The process was agonizing, with his meridians feeling like they were on fire, but he persevered.

After completing the Grand Celestial Cycle, Lin Xuan re-entered the illusionary realm, repeating the cycle of absorption, refinement, and circulation. His dantian now contained a pale green orb, formed by the accumulation of his spiritual force. The orb twisted and changed, as more spiritual energy was injected into it.

After a month in the refining path, Lin Xuan felt a significant improvement in his cultivation. He launched another attempt to break through to the next layer of the Ling Dong stage. For cultivators, each advancement brought about a transformation in their spiritual force. Lin Xuan was now at a critical juncture.

With a final burst of effort, he infused the remaining spiritual force into the orb. The orb underwent a transformation, with flashes of lightning appearing on its surface. It was on the verge of collapse.

Lin Xuan maintained his focus, but it was too late. With a soft explosion, the orb shattered, releasing the accumulated spiritual force. It dispersed into fine threads, evenly distributing throughout his dantian.
