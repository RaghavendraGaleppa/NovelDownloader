# Chapter 6: The Pure Origin Breath Visualization Method

The next day, as dawn's first light crept across the sky, rustling sounds emerged from one of the stone houses.

Soon after, Zhang Jing, fully dressed and brimming with energy, pushed open the door and stepped outside. He curiously surveyed his surroundings in the dim morning light.

The environment was tranquil and serene. Despite being midwinter, the island remained lush with greenery. Birdsong echoed intermittently from all directions. Nearby, narrow stone houses identical to his own showed slivers of light seeping through their door cracks - evidently, no one had dared forget Instructor Wang's instructions from the previous day.

Turning back for one last look at his dwelling, Zhang Jing couldn't help but murmur to himself with a smile, "It was too dark yesterday to see properly. Now that I look properly, even though it's the lowest-grade 'C' accommodation, this stone house isn't bad at all."

"Just a bit small, that's all."

Indeed, Zhang Jing had initially intended to choose the 'B' grade cottages that at least resembled proper living quarters. But after inquiring with the servants, he'd decisively turned toward the stone houses instead. The reason was simple - money. Opting for a cottage would have left him with less than five taels of silver, and after witnessing the Dao Academy's style yesterday, Zhang Jing was certain there would be other expenses beyond just lodging. Better to save where he could.

Fortunately, while the stone house appeared crude from outside, its interior was fully equipped with all necessities - bed, chairs, stools, bedding, and kitchenware.

After a quick breakfast of dry rations from his pack, Zhang Jing checked the time and eagerly set off for the Transmission Hall, his steps light with anticipation. After yearning for this moment for years, it was finally arriving.

Along the way, Zhang Jing noticed that the vast majority of newcomers from Huizhou had made the same choice as him. Only a dozen or so, judging by their fine clothing clearly marking them as wealthy or noble, had opted for the cottages. As expected, only Ji Bochang and his three companions occupied the 'A' grade courtyard houses.

Passing through the courtyard area, Zhang Jing happened to encounter the flamboyant Ji Bochang emerging from his residence. Their eyes met, and Ji Bochang's face immediately broke into a brilliant yet somewhat roguish smile. Flicking open a painted fan with his left hand, he sauntered over to Zhang Jing.

"Brother Zhang, why didn't you choose to—"

In the Transmission Hall, seated on the foremost cushion, Ji Bochang suddenly turned back and asked in a hushed voice. Before Zhang Jing could respond, however, heavy footsteps abruptly echoed through the hall, cutting Ji Bochang off.

Ji Bochang swiftly turned back around, while Zhang Jing's gaze shifted to Instructor Wang, who had appeared without warning on the platform.

"Good," Instructor Wang said, casting an approving glance over the seated assembly. "No one is late. Let's get straight to the point."

With that, he swept a hand over a black leather pouch at his waist, and instantly a jade slip materialized in his palm. The translucent slip bore faint traces of mysterious runic patterns on its surface.

From his seat in the second row, Zhang Jing's eyes narrowed as he clearly saw the jade slip appear out of nowhere. His gaze unconsciously drifted to the black leather pouch at Instructor Wang's waist - likely some sort of spatial magic tool.

"Containing the universe in a mustard seed?" Zhang Jing mused to himself.

As for the jade slip—

"This jade slip contains one of Dragon Lake Dao Academy's foundational cultivation methods," Instructor Wang announced, "called the 'Pure Origin Breath Visualization Method.'"

His words instantly drew fervent gazes from nearly everyone present. Excitement rippled through the crowd - wasn't this very method the reason they had come to the academy's trials? Now that a cultivation technique lay before them, their enthusiasm was only natural.

Zhang Jing also fixed his eyes intently on the jade slip, though his expression remained calm. With the mysterious jade talisman by his side, along with the Mind's Eye Dao Seed and the Dark Python Devouring Void Dao Imprint, he was confident of passing the trials and stepping onto the immortal path. This confidence allowed him to restrain his inner excitement.

On the platform, Instructor Wang's sharp gaze swept across each face below as if trying to peer into their very souls.

"Four scions of immortal cultivation families?" he thought with surprise. "Could it be that our Seventh Provisional Academy will shine in this year's trials? If we rank in the top three overall, how many Dao merit rewards would that be..."

Raising his voice, Instructor Wang declared solemnly: "The rules for this trial are as follows:"

"After learning the Pure Origin Breath Visualization Method, all participants will have thirty days to practice."

"After thirty days, those who achieve initial mastery will pass the trial and enter Dragon Lake Dao Academy's outer sect. Those who fail will have their memories of the method erased before being returned to their original academies."

His words acted like a bucket of cold water on the previously excited crowd. Expressions of panic instantly replaced enthusiasm, and the air in the Transmission Hall grew heavy with tension.

"Understood?" Instructor Wang's gruff voice boomed.

"Understood!" came the simultaneous reply.

Nodding in satisfaction, Instructor Wang extended a large hand. A white glow flickered at his fingertips as the jade slip floated up before him. After glancing at Ji Bochang and the other three in front, he directed the slip toward Chu Lingyun in the middle row.

"Your name?"

"Instructor, I'm Chu Lingyun."

"Chu Lingyun?" Instructor Wang paused, then coughed lightly. "Ahem, Lingyun, you'll be responsible for safeguarding this jade slip today. Ensure everyone learns the method before leaving."

"You can count on me, Instructor!" Chu Lingyun responded earnestly, lifting her chin with determination.

"Good. To use it, press the slip to your forehead, concentrate your spirit, and attempt to connect with it."

"Understood."

Addressing the assembly again, Instructor Wang announced: "After learning the method today, you may begin practicing. All necessary instructions are contained within the transmission. Tomorrow at the first quarter of mao hour [5:15 AM], I'll be here to lecture for those interested."

With a flash of light, Instructor Wang vanished from the platform.

Standing up, Chu Lingyun addressed the group with a gentle smile: "Everyone, please remain in the hall until you've learned the method. Due to our numbers, we'll proceed in turns - my apologies for the wait."

"As compensation, I'll host a meal at the Spirit Dining Hall three days hence. I hope you'll all attend."

She clasped her hands in a gesture that blended grace with boldness.

"You're too kind, Fairy Chu!"
"Indeed, Fairy Chu! Just say the word - who would dare oppose your arrangements?"
"Exactly! Please arrange as you see fit."

Chu Lingyun acknowledged their responses with a nod. "In that case, I thank you all in advance."

Turning to Ji Bochang and the other two, she gestured with the jade slip. "Shall you three gentlemen go first?"

"No need for formalities," Wu Mingyuan quickly declined. "Since the instructor chose you, you should proceed first."

Deng Yuan and Ji Bochang exchanged glances before nodding in agreement.

"Then I'll not stand on ceremony." A faint blush colored Chu Lingyun's fair cheeks as she pressed the jade slip to her forehead and closed her eyes.

Time passed quickly.

By late afternoon, it was finally Zhang Jing's turn. As one of the last to receive the transmission, he'd mentally rehearsed the process dozens of times already. Without hesitation, he placed the jade slip against his forehead and focused his spirit to connect with it.

Instantly, a torrent of profound and complex information flooded his consciousness.

On his mysterious jade talisman, a new line of text slowly materialized:
