# Chapter 23: Effortlessly Eliminating a Foundation Establishment Cultivator!

Facing the Foundation Establishment enemy before him, Lin Yun produced a small black-green gourd from his sleeve. After forming several hand seals and channeling his spiritual power into it, the gourd floated above his head and spat out eight purple-black orbs.

With a pointed finger from Lin Yun, the orbs shot forward.

The Foundation Establishment cultivator opposite him, having watched Lin Yun's preparations, burst into laughter upon seeing the attack. "With all that arrogance, I thought you had some real skills! You think common Mixed Origin Pearls that anyone can get their hands on can threaten me?"

With a casual flick of his sleeve, the terrifying spiritual pressure he unleashed sent the eight orbs flying away.

Lin Yun flicked his own sleeve in response, releasing several talismans that shot toward his opponent.

"Oh? Talismans? Now that's more interesting. I didn't expect someone like you to possess high-grade primary talismans!" The yellow-robed Foundation Establishment cultivator poured a large amount of spiritual power into his top-grade magical tool, the Crimson Gold Ring, which erupted with golden light and blocked all of Lin Yun's talismans.

At that moment, Lin Yun once again directed the Mixed Origin Pearls toward the Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Still relying on these Mixed Origin Pearls to attack me? How delusional! I told you—they're useless!"

"Huh? Why are these three so small? And blue—"

"BOOM—"

The yellow-robed cultivator attempted to swat the orbs away again, but as they neared him, his spiritual sense suddenly detected something amiss. The eight orbs had inexplicably become eleven, with three of them being no larger than marbles—far smaller than ordinary Mixed Origin Pearls—and colored blue.

In his panic, it was too late to dodge. A bronze mirror slipped from his sleeve, summoning a yellow cloud to shield his body.

"BOOM—"

"BOOM—"

"BOOM—"

Three deafening explosions echoed through the forest. Terrifying white lightning engulfed the surroundings, the sheer force of the blasts uprooting the nearest trees and melting the ground at the epicenter into molten slag.

"He actually reacted in time. As expected of a Foundation Establishment cultivator's spiritual sense—far superior to a Qi Condensation cultivator's. If I'd only used one, he might have blocked it."

Surveying the now-empty blast zone, Lin Yun thought smugly, "Still, I was one step ahead!"

"So strong! What incredible power!"

"To think he could kill a Foundation Establishment cultivator so easily!" Han Li was both shocked and deeply curious about what Lin Yun had used. "And he even injured a Core Formation cultivator with it back at Mount Tai Nan's pagoda! What exactly is that thing?"

"Sky Thunder Pearls?! He still has more?!" Dong Xuan'er gasped in astonishment, her delicate lips parting slightly. "I thought there were only seventy-three in existence, and even finding one is nearly impossible. Where did Brother Lin get so many?"

"Han Li, are you alright?" Lin Yun turned away from the devastation and walked over to check on his companion.

"Brother Lin, I'm fine." Han Li took Lin Yun's outstretched hand and stood up, gratitude clear in his voice. "Once again, you've saved my life."

"No need for formalities. We're like brothers, you and I—different parents but kindred spirits." Lin Yun waved it off before handing Han Li a small yellow shield. "The path of cultivation is fraught with danger. Take this Earth Essence Shield for protection. This time, I was here to help, but if I'm not around next time, you'll need to defend yourself."

"Brother Lin, I won't forget your kindness. One day, I'll repay you." This time, Han Li didn't refuse. He had come too close to death to care about pride. "Consider this shield a purchase. I'll settle the debt with you later."

"Between brothers, such talk is unnecessary." Lin Yun dismissed the notion with a casual wave.

**[Ding! Host has gifted top-grade defensive magical tool 'Earth Essence Shield' to friend Han Li, triggering 'Cast a Peach, Receive a Plum' effect.]**  
**[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained rare treasure: Emperor Scale Armor.]**  
**[Treasure Description: An inner armor forged by the barbarian Beard of the Chaotic Star Sea, offering exceptional defense capable of withstanding attacks from Nascent Soul cultivators.]**  

"Emperor Scale Armor?! What an incredible treasure! Han Li truly is a good brother!" Lin Yun rejoiced inwardly at the system's notification.

"Brother Lin, why aren't you concerned about me?!" Dong Xuan'er stomped her foot in frustration when she saw Lin Yun prioritize Han Li and even gift him a top-grade defensive tool instead of comforting her. "I was nearly assassinated! My heart is still racing! Here, feel it!" 

The more Lin Yun ignored her, the more infatuated she became. She despised those who fawned over her—it was his aloofness that drew her in.

"Brother Lin, I don't have any protective treasures either! It was so dangerous earlier—I almost perished! Give me one too! Please! Big Brother!" She clung to his arm, shaking it pleadingly. "You wouldn't want poor Xuan'er to meet an untimely end, would you? If you give me something, I'll treasure it always! And when we reach the Yellow Maple Valley, I'll tell my master everything. She'll reward you with top-grade tools, talismans, pills—anything you want!"

Lin Yun knew that managing Dong Xuan'er required a delicate balance. Too much attention would make her overbearing, but too little would drive her away. 

"Rewards are unnecessary. What matters is that you learn to protect yourself. Don't rely solely on your master—cultivate self-reliance. I can't always be there to shield you." He handed her a delicate pink fan. "This Spring Transformation Fan was something I acquired by chance. I give it to you now. Remember my words."

"Wow! Such a beautiful jade fan!" Dong Xuan'er marveled as she examined the gift. The fan's frame was made of jade, one side depicting a peach blossom grove, the other a painting of noble ladies. "And it's a top-grade magical tool! It might even rival the legendary Wind Thunder Fan! Brother Lin, you're too good to me! I knew you cared!"

Though Dong Xuan'er accepted the gift, the system remained silent. Lin Yun wasn't surprised—he had already tried exploiting this loophole. Items obtained from the system couldn't trigger the "Cast a Peach, Receive a Plum" effect when returned to their original owners.

Still, he had his reasons for gifting the fan. A woman's first gift from a man was significant. A common treasure could be replaced, but this exquisite fan would leave a lasting impression. Even if Dong Xuan'er reached Core Formation, she would still use it until she forged her own magic treasure. Every time she wielded it, she would think of him.

And if her master confiscated it? Even better. Nothing was more memorable than having something precious snatched away before it could be enjoyed.

Overjoyed, Dong Xuan'er threw her arms around Lin Yun and planted a kiss on his cheek before shyly lowering her head, caressing the fan as if it were Lin Yun himself.

"Hmph! Chen Qiaoqian, Brother Lin has given me a top-grade treasure! I've already won!" she gloated inwardly, already planning to flaunt her prize once they reached the Yellow Maple Valley.

Han Li watched Dong Xuan'er's display with concealed envy. A top-grade treasure was rare even among elite cultivators. But what concerned him more was Lin Yun's apparent intention to join the Yellow Maple Valley. 

*How strange... Wherever I go, Brother Lin follows. Could it be... for me?* The thought sent a shiver down his spine. 

*No, that can't be!* Han Li glanced at Lin Yun again. *Well... maybe it wouldn't be so bad...* 

"Han Li, what are you thinking?! Snap out of it! Brother Lin just sees you as a sworn brother!" 

**[Ding! Han Li's favorability +1. Current favorability: 81 (Brother, you smell nice!)]**  

"Huh? What the—? Han Li, what's this about?" Puzzled by the system's message, Lin Yun instinctively edged closer to Dong Xuan'er. The sweet fragrance of youth soothed his nerves.
