# Chapter 179: The Progress of the Lonely Nine Swords, the Condensation of the Sword Pill!

Wu Chushu had stepped onto the arena?

"The swordsman who traveled by sword this morning?"

"I heard he single-handedly leveled the White Wolf Stronghold and saved dozens of fallen women."

"I heard his Myriad Flowers and Wandering Dragon Sword Art was derived from his own comprehension of the Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark. It's elegant and elusive. I wonder if Li Mo can still find a flaw in it."

...

Wu Chushu was already famous. Six or seven out of every ten martial artists present had heard of him. One could say he was once the top figure in Yunzhou...

When he ascended the stage, his figure soared into the air.

The man had not yet arrived, but his sword was already there.

Only when his long sword was plunged into the ground with a clang did he finally stand upon the hilt.

From this entrance method, it was not hard to understand why he was so renowned. He was very good at leaving a lasting impression.

"I have long heard of your great name."

Li Mo cupped his fists, his expression unchanged.

It was a small scene.

With his rich experience in reading novels, Young Master Li had been tempered by countless arrogant protagonists and was well-versed in various ways to show off in front of an audience.

"I hope you will show mercy later, Brother Li."

Wu Chushu was also a man of the scene. What he was thinking now was not how to win, but how to avoid losing too much face. Even if he lost, he had to lose beautifully and gracefully...

With this in mind, he took a step forward, his soft sword appearing in his hand, a smile on his lips, his posture very handsome.

"Please!"

"Please."

Li Mo also held the Chixiao Sword, his demeanor impeccable.

He was also very handsome.

The arena was very quiet.

Countless eyes were fixed on the two standing on the stage, but the two remained motionless in their postures.

The onlookers were confused. Why weren't they moving?

"Could this be a spiritual battle of will?"

"I feel it's a clash of aura. Their postures are both very imposing."

"Hisss... It feels so profound."

...

The uninformed spectators could not help but discuss in whispers.

Jiang Chulong tilted her head, blinking her gray-white eyes.

What is Brother Li doing?

They were simply just posing. There was no sword intent or sword pressure at all.

Could it be... a kind of battle she couldn't understand?

Brother Li is really amazing...

Even Princess Jiang couldn't understand it.

Obviously, no one present could.

"..."

In eyes as clear as an ice mirror, the handsome figure of the young man was reflected. Yin Tang's delicate brows furrowed for a moment before smoothing out.

He was just like this. Usually, he was measured, steady, and gentle, but occasionally, he would act inexplicably childish.

"Please."

"You should go first."

"No, no, no, you go first. I've heard that your Myriad Flowers and Wandering Dragon Sword Art has endless variations. I've long wanted to see it."

Both were elegant and refined.

"Hisss..."

Wu Chushu sucked in a cold breath. He felt he had encountered the greatest opponent of his life. (Not in terms of sword art).

If he didn't make a move soon, Elder Zeng, his master, would start scolding him.

After a moment of silence, he could only nod.

"As you wish, I shall not hold back."

Then, the soft sword in his palm seemed to suddenly come alive.

Myriad flowers flew about, beautiful and magnificent.

Li Mo thought of the Falling Flower Sword Art that Yin Tang had once used.

In terms of sword art mastery, the Ice Cube was naturally far superior, yet Wu Chushu's sword art itself was of a higher grade, with even more variations.

Each petal seemed to be able to transform into a sword light at his will.

This was the sword art he had comprehended from the Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark, one that belonged entirely to him.

---

In terms of this sword art alone, he dared say that no one in the entire Sword City was more masterful than him.

It was at the level of Perfection!

"Excellent sword art!"

Li Mo praised sincerely.

As expected, one should not underestimate the heroes of the world.

If it were him back when he first set out from the Clear Abyss Sect, he truly would not have been able to find a flaw in this sword art. After all, this sword art perfectly matched his own Martial Soul's intent and physique.

To solve it, he might have had to take out his hammer...

But on his way here, including just moments ago, he had been continuously growing stronger!

"No matter how masterful a sword art, there is always a 'fledging' one."

"Perfection simply does not exist in sword art."

A sword light, like a phantom thunder, flashed past.

It precisely pierced through dozens of petals in a row, tracing an unimaginable trajectory to strike the soft sword itself.

The petals were all infused with Qi, allowing them to move with Wu Chushu's will.

This single sword strike passed through every petal at the exact moment Wu Chushu's mind was focused on it.

Wu Chushu's mind trembled violently, but he did not pull back to defend.

His will was clear, and the entire realm of wild flowers in the sky transformed into sharp edges, enveloping him as he descended from above.

This move was not only powerful.

It was also very cool!

This was his obsession with the Dao of the Sword, you bastard!

"Here it comes!"

Li Mo closed his eyes. All the moves he had just comprehended appeared vividly before him.

Martial Dao insights were injected!

The sword pressure of others, the sword Qi of others, the sword intent of others.

At this moment, they all fused into one furnace within the Lonely Nine Swords.

In his Dantian, something seemed to be condensing, on the verge of emerging.

Who says I'm not a swordsman too, you bastard!

"Watch this next sword strike carefully, my friend."

"When..."

When Young Master Li opened his eyes again, his entire being was like a shocking divine sword.

All the weapons of everyone present began to tremble at this moment.

Then, with a whoosh, they all flew from their hands, soaring onto the high platform and hovering in the air, blotting out the sky.

Standing high above in his Cloud-Walking Boots, Li Mo stood with his hands behind his back, commanding a hundred swords to submit!

"It will be very cool."

Young Master Li said calmly.

The thousands of weapons and the rain of flowers collided.

The result was self-evident.

Wu Chushu's scalp went numb, and he fell to his knees, his face pale.

He had lost.

Seeing the scene Li Mo had just created, he instantly knew he had lost completely.

"I... declare you the strongest!" Wu Chushu said with a bitter smile, a full body of goosebumps.

...

"A hundred swords in the air? Ten thousand weapons submitting? Hisss..."

"What a peerless demeanor! The next issue of 'The霸道 Empress Falls in Love with Me' must illustrate this scene!"

"He's so handsome."

"What kind of god-like sword art mastery is this to be able to do such a thing?"

...

The onlookers naturally did not know the truth.

In fact, even Zhong Zhenyue and Huang Donglai only saw the surface.

The truth was...

"It's that body-refining technique."

Yin Tang's lips, as clear as shattered jade, curled into a helpless yet amused arc.

Hmm...

Actually, Young Master Li had only caused the famous swords present to resonate, but it wasn't enough to make them fly into the sky.

He had secretly used the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body to control the Weapon Slaughter Sharpness Qi, which then牵引ed the weapons present.

"That kid is not right."

"Did any of you feel the aura of a condensing Xuan Dan just now?"

On the high platform, Elder Zeng frowned, uncertain.

Li Mo was clearly already at the Observation of the Divine Realm!

"That is a Sword Pill."

A calm and gentle voice suddenly rang out in the arena.

Accompanied by the crisp and pleasant sound of bells, someone slowly walked over.
