# Chapter 320: The Zhang Liu Golden Light, True Feelings and True Intent, the Mistress Grants a Martial Art, the Flick of a Finger Golden Light

The Spirit Treasure entered his belly, and the Art’s essence naturally arose. Having obtained the Art of Golden Light, its mysteries were endless. Li Xian practiced the "Xun Wind Breath," his breathing deep, slow, and calm, steady and composed. He contemplated the wonders of the Art’s essence.

He felt the essence of heaven and earth nourishing and growing within his stomach, a coolness penetrating his body, bringing infinite encouragement. The Morning Yellow Dew transformed into "five hundred and thirty-nine strands" of heaven and earth essence, swirling and churning in his stomach. After being strengthened by the Consume Food technique, it became nine hundred and thirty-six strands, safely remaining in his body to be digested later.

The Art essence of the Golden Scales, the Yellow Nine Ginseng, and the Morning Yellow Dew... blended and brewed with each other, and the embryonic form of the Art gradually took shape. Li Xian tasted the Art’s essence, pushing its evolution to the extreme. He had just entered this realm, feeling both shocked and amazed: "So this is the process of obtaining an Art. The Way of Martial Arts takes from heaven and earth, with the intent that man can conquer nature. The Way of Arts also takes from heaven and earth, with the intent that heaven and earth helps me. I, Li Xian, come from a humble background, advancing step by step. To be able to witness such a strange scene and experience these profound and mysterious matters is truly a stroke of good fortune. The Mistress has a strange temperament, yet she treats me... both extremely well and extremely badly."

His heart was in a turmoil, but he immediately thought again: "This缘分 is too difficult to explain, I should just focus on contemplating!"

Li Xian contemplated for a long time. The Golden Scales, Yellow Nine Ginseng, Morning Yellow Dew... all had been strengthened by the Consume Food technique, their Art essence extremely rich. The feelings and insights he gained from this stage were truly superior to others. Although Wen Caishang had never personally seen the "Way of Arts · Golden Light," throughout ancient and modern times, there were many who had obtained the Art of Golden Light.

He saw the golden light shimmering around his body, flickering on and off. Time passed, and in the blink of an eye, it was morning. The morning sun and dew sprinkled over his entire body. Li Xian sat in a spacious place, cross-legged and meditating, with no external objects blocking him. His long hair drifted with the wind, and the morning sunlight poured over his whole body, as if coated in a layer of gold paint. A few strands of thin hair brushed against his cheeks. He had fully contemplated the Art’s essence, and everything went smoothly and safely. Great success was achieved.

In that instant, he obtained the Art: Golden Light.

The "Way of Arts" had first sprouted within his physique, and he had become an Art-obtaining martial artist. Li Xian’s joy was hard to conceal. He put two fingers together, cast the "Way of Arts · Golden Light," and a golden light burst out all over his body. It started from his hands and feet, gradually enveloping his entire body, transforming into a halo of light in the shape of a man.

Li Xian’s mind moved, and his entire body turned into countless shimmering light spots. Like water, they flowed to a distance of sixteen feet, then gathered again, condensing back into his original form. The "Way of Arts · Golden Light" was also named "Zhang Liu Golden Light" (Sixteen Foot Golden Light).

The lower section of the Golden Light Recipe records: Those who consume the Golden Scales, Yellow Nine Ginseng, and Morning Yellow Dew will obtain the Art of Golden Light. Their body will be like flowing light, able to leap sixteen feet, able to avoid blades and swords, able to dodge fists and feet, able to instantly appear behind an enemy, able to flee from danger, with endless wonders. However, it consumes a great deal of strength. Leaping nine feet a day will exhaust one’s strength. Leaping twelve feet a day will endanger one’s life!

Li Xian had not obtained the "lower section of the recipe" and did not know the detailed requirements of the Golden Light. This time, turning into flowing light and leaping a distance of sixteen feet, although he felt a great consumption of physical strength, he still felt relaxed and natural. His mind moved again, and he formed a hand seal to cast the "Golden Light Art," turning his body into golden light and leaping two zhangs away.

He still felt no obstruction or clumsiness. So he cast the "Golden Light Art" again, leaping horizontally two zhangs and eight chi. Finally reaching the limit of the Art, the flowing light gathered, and his original body reappeared. It turned out that Li Xian, strengthened by the "Consume Food" technique, had a richer Art essence, and the "Golden Light" he obtained was several times stronger than others.

The Sixteen Foot Golden Light had become "Two Zhangs Eight Golden Light." And it consumed less strength, was lighter and more at ease. This strange occurrence was rare throughout the ages, unique to this one instance. Li Xian felt even more delighted, pondering: "This Art seems simple, but the simpler it is, the more uses it has. Having obtained the Golden Light Art, my life-preserving ability can naturally be strengthened by another level."

Li Xian operated the "Golden Light" again, a flowing light and overflowing color. He leaped up two zhangs and eight chi, then cast the Golden Light again in mid-air, changing his position, incredibly agile, with many marvelous uses.

The施展 of the Way of Arts consumed a great deal of strength. Li Xian leaped several times in succession, showing no sign of exhaustion, but he did feel a slight fatigue and was sweating profusely. Li Xian thought to himself: "My physical strength is great, yet after just a few times I feel a slight inability to continue. It seems that although the Way of Arts is marvelous, it is by no means without restraint. I will rest for a while, then ponder the details of this Art."

He lay down on the spot, the gentle breeze blowing, feeling extremely comfortable. Outside, the wind and frost were relentless, but the Blue Fragrance Pavilion was full of spring. The scenery was leisurely, with the faint cries of birds and beasts, and the sound of a clear spring tinkling.

When his strength had recovered, he began to ponder how to combine the "Way of Arts · Golden Light" with martial arts. The Corpse Demon Spear was gloomy and ghostly, quite contrary to the Golden Light. But the few moves of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword, if paired with the "Golden Light Art," might have an excellent effect.

Li Xian’s interest was piqued, and he immediately practiced swordplay in the courtyard. The Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword had reached its peak. When he executed the sword, he tried to incorporate the Golden Light Art, seeking the fusion of "Martial" and "Art." He saw his figure, the sword brighter than the morning sun, his body like flowing light.

His heroic spirit was soaring. From the shadows, Wen Caishang’s eyes widened in surprise, and she watched with a smile for a long time.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +1\]

The Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword grew increasingly profound. He tempered the sword stances, perceived the martial arts intent, and gradually digested the heaven and earth essence within his body. His martial arts advanced steadily and surely. Li Xian was immersed in it, unconsciously approaching noon.

When he came to his senses, he felt deeply exhausted. He leaned against a tree, his waist and legs aching. He continuously practiced the "Xun Wind Breath" to restore his strength. Li Xian thought to himself: "Just now, I performed a set of sword techniques and cast the Golden Light Art fourteen times. I am truly exhausted to the extreme. Each time I cast the Golden Light Art, although I moved more than two zhangs, it felt like running ten miles or more. Paired with the Way of Arts Golden Light, I can flicker and move agilely. Although I could barely defeat an enemy, if my physical strength is exhausted, it is also dangerous! In a real battle, I cannot use it recklessly."

Suddenly, he heard a round of applause. Wen Caishang was already by the courtyard, having watched for a long time. Her martial arts attainments were immeasurably deep, like a ghost or a phantom, truly frightening. Seeing that Li Xian’s Way of Arts was already formed, and his ability far exceeded what the "Recipe" described, a sharp glint flashed in her eyes. She thought: "This boy’s talent is unparalleled, his comprehension is extraordinarily high, and he is quite suited to the Golden Light. That is why he obtained the Art more refinedly, and the Way of Arts is stronger? I have held all three Spirit Treasures for this Golden Light Art in my hands, but because I had already consumed other Spirit Treasures first, the 'Way of Arts' from the initial formula, the Recipe has not yet been fully pieced together. I dare not consume other Spirit Treasures recklessly, lest I disrupt the order. Otherwise, I would have also assembled this Golden Light Art."

Li Xian sheathed his sword and said: "Mistress, when did you arrive? Li Xian has been remiss. It is cold and freezing, please come inside quickly." Seeing Li Xian’s thoughtful inquiry, Wen Caishang’s eyebrows showed joy, and she nodded: "I just arrived. Li Lang, are you living comfortably here?"

Li Xian said: "The scenery here is beautiful, the objects are beautiful, and the person is beautiful. I am extremely accustomed to it. Mistress, when are we returning to the manor?"

Wen Caishang’s heart warmed slightly, her voice calm as she said: "Oh? You are in a hurry to return to the manor?" Li Xian said sincerely: "My roots are always with the Mistress, and only with the Mistress. The Mistress disregards past grievances and is willing to accept me again. I naturally want to return early to clear the debt."

"Whether it is three thousand eight hundred sword strokes, or thirty-eight thousand, or tens of millions, as long as it makes the Mistress happy, I can endure it."

Wen Caishang’s eyes were filled with great joy, her heart deeply moved. "You have this intention, I am very happy." She walked elsewhere, her lotus skirt fluttering, the hairpin in her hair swaying gently, extremely beautiful and dignified. Li Xian followed closely by her side. The two turned out of the small courtyard and arrived by a green lake.

As they passed by the lake, Wen Caishang said: "Just now, Li Lang’s sword dance was handsome and elegant, yet not lacking in masculine heat and passion. In the midst of his sweeping and galloping, he had an excellent demeanor. I did not expect that in just a few years, you have already surpassed me in this Yang Sword." Li Xian said: "Without the Mistress’s help, how could I have today? To speak truthfully, the Mistress is truly the noble person of my life. To have met the Mistress is the great fortune of my three lives."

Wen Caishang was infinitely delighted. Although she knew Li Xian’s words were sweet nothings, she loved to hear them and insisted on hearing them. She said coquettishly: "You say sweet words to please me. Even if you please me, I won’t reduce your debt by a single coin." Feeling the warmth from Li Xian’s palm, her heart was in constant turmoil. Yesterday she had been suddenly disturbed, but today there was no third person.

Li Xian said: "This life is already difficult to repay the debt. What does it matter if I owe a few more?" Wen Caishang pointed a finger at Li Xian’s chest,嗔道: "You know it well. You owe me, you can never repay it in this lifetime. Li Lang, extend your hand."

Wen Caishang demanded another sword stroke. Seeing Li Xian’s expression remain normal, but cold sweat pouring down, she knew this sword stroke brought pain that reached the heart and soul. She felt heartache for her beloved. Her mood was complex and contradictory; she could not clearly handle matters of感情, and her handling was extremely inappropriate. But her nature was like this, and it was hard to change. Her heart was full of resentment, and when she was alone, it could still linger in her mind. But when the two met and she heard a few sweet words, she would momentarily forget it.

That day was quiet and peaceful, with no third person to disturb them. The two strolled through the garden. The scenery was the same, yet they did not feel bored. When night fell, under the flowers and the moon. The two were extremely close, whispering to each other. Li Xian said: "Mistress, I have been practicing painting, and my painting skills have gradually improved. The scenery now is very good. Shall I paint a portrait for you?"

Hearing the word "painting," Wen Caishang’s pretty face flushed slightly. She thought of the journey along the river, where she had personally taught him the foundations of calligraphy and painting. But a little thief interfered, causing him to perform poorly, making the painting very messy.

Wen Caishang was extremely intelligent and said: "I think you are still afraid that I will gouge out your eyes." Li Xian said: "I am only afraid that later my eyes will be blind, and I will regret never having painted a portrait for the Mistress. Leaving a lifelong regret."

Wen Caishang’s beautiful eyes reddened, moved and heartached. She said: "Good Li Lang, I never truly wanted to harm you. If you are hurt or touched, I also feel heartache. But you... you always make me so conflicted. If I don’t teach you this bad temper, then... This... is a helpless measure."

Li Xian said: "As long as it makes the Mistress happy, it is fine if I suffer a little pain."

Wen Caishang said lovingly: "Good Li Lang... I feel heartache seeing you in pain. You might as well never..." She saw Li Xian’s eyes were bright and deep, extremely good-looking. She truly did not wish to harm him in the slightest. Her heartache was real, and her pity was even more real. She almost said, "There is no need to gouge out your eyes. I only hope that in the future you will treat me well, and we will never part."

But the words stopped at the tip of her tongue and were never spoken out. She was inherently demanding of perfection. When she first cultivated Li Xian, it was because she saw that his talent was passable, his background was clean, he was loyal and devoted, and he handled affairs comprehensively. At this point, she had already linked "devoted love" with "gouging out eyes," hoping that Li Xian would be devoted to her alone in his lifetime. Only then would it be perfect.

Wen Caishang compensated: "Li Lang, you suffer a sliver of pain for me, and I love you an inch more. If you gouge out your eyes for me, my life is also yours. After the affairs of the Dragon Banquet are concluded, my strength has greatly improved. Others do not know, but I tell you alone. By my side, others cannot bully you. Although your eyes will be blind, I will not let you live in darkness all day. I know a martial art called 'Heart’s Eye,' which can also see the beautiful scenery of the world."

She secretly thought: "There is not just one martial art related to 'Heart’s Eye' in the world. The Western Regions’ Buddhist sect has a 'Bodhi Heart Enlightenment Art.' When practiced to perfection, one can open the Heart’s Eye and observe all things with the heart. But it is not suitable for Li Lang. Instead, the 'Sky-Soaring Sect’s’ 'Heart-Connection Knot Art' is more suitable. This martial art requires two people to cultivate together. Their hearts are connected, thereby achieving the effect of seeing with the Heart’s Eye. But it requires the two to practice this art together."

"In this way, Li Lang can only see the outside world when he is by my side. With a thought from me, what he can see and what he cannot see is all under my control. Only such a Li Lang belongs to me alone."

Thinking of this, her cheeks were extremely flushed, and her emotions stirred. The Sky-Soaring Sect was an unorthodox sect, specializing in matters between men and women. The 'Heart-Connection Knot Art' possessed an evil intent. Wen Caishang was neither righteous nor evil, and she had already made her decision in her heart.

Li Xian said: "That is excellent. The Mistress has considered everything thoroughly for me." Wen Caishang instructed Xiao Tuan to set up the painting tools. The two then chatted affectionately in the pavilion, their actions close, having already crossed many boundaries. Xiao Tuan was young and knew her place, never disturbing them. After setting up the painting tools, she covered her face and ran away.

Brush, ink, paper, and inkstone were all set up. But the two were talking intimately, almost leaning on each other. It was not until late at night that they remembered this matter. It was the beginning of the twelfth lunar month, deep into winter. Snow and frost covered the ground, and the moon was incomplete.

Li Xian raised his brush to sketch, painting the beauty under the moon onto the paper. His painting skills were still shallow, but his comprehension was high, and he knew how to use his strengths and avoid his weaknesses. Seeing that his brush was shallow and his ink was cheap, it was difficult to paint Wen Caishang’s appearance, so he simply did not paint it. He only painted her vague figure, set against many landscapes.

Wen Caishang was delighted to see it and wanted Xiao Tuan to treasure it. Li Xian said: "Mistress, in the future, I will paint for you every day. This painting’s skill is too shallow, I am truly ashamed. It is not worth treasuring."

Wen Caishang said: "It is rare for you to have this intention. Even if the painting skill is shallow, I like it very much." She raised her sleeve, handed the painting to Xiao Tuan, applied a kind of ointment to prevent the ink from fading, then put it into a box for storage.

Li Xian originally wanted to take this opportunity to sell the painting to pass on information and attract the attention of the Flower Cage Sect. Seeing that this plan was difficult to achieve, he planned another strategy. He thought to himself: "I will paint for her every day. She won’t be in a hurry to gouge out my eyes."

Wen Caishang said softly: "That’s right. Li Lang, how is your comprehension of the Way of Arts? Have you encountered any problems? The Way of Arts Golden Light is called the Zhang Liu Golden Light. The body is like flowing light, able to leap sixteen feet in an instant."

"Although it is only a distance of sixteen feet, sometimes life and death terror is hidden within a hair’s breadth. This distance of sixteen feet has many uses."

Her words concealed a killing intent. After she finished speaking with He Wentian last night, she arrived at the side pavilion to observe Li Xian’s actions. Although she was always deceived by sweet words when she was with Li Xian, the moment they parted, her rationality returned. She expected that Li Xian’s nature was cunning. Having just fallen into the trap, how could he resign himself to his fate? He spoke beautifully of being together forever and loving her to the bone, but in reality, he must be plotting an escape route. Therefore, she guarded him in secret. If there was any unusual movement, she would施以 severe punishment and strictly force him to gouge out his eyes.

But seeing Li Xian consume the Spirit Treasures, she was slightly pleased. She watched for the entire night, seeing how Li Xian obtained the Art, how he施展 the Way of Arts, and how he paired the Way of Arts with sword techniques.

Li Xian’s "Golden Light Art" was far superior to others, which she knew very well. She also knew that Li Xian only knew the "upper section of the Golden Light Recipe" and did not know the detailed explanation of the lower section. She thought: "This boy does not know that his Golden Light Art is very strong. He still thinks he is no different from others. If I ask him directly, he will surely not dare to hide anything and will tell me everything. That would not be fun. Let me test your loyalty. I will first tell you about the Zhang Liu Golden Light, and see if your Two Zhangs Eight Golden Light will also turn into Zhang Liu Golden Light, hiding your ability and deliberately deceiving me."

Hearing the "Zhang Liu Golden Light," Li Xian was immediately surprised: "So the Golden Light Art recorded in the recipe can only leap sixteen feet. My Two Zhangs Eight Golden Light is much stronger." He said truthfully: "Ah? Zhang Liu Golden Light?"

Wen Caishang deliberately said: "Yes. Zhang Liu Golden Light... from ancient times to the present, all who have obtained the Art of Golden Light have been able to leap a distance of sixteen feet."

Li Xian said: "Mistress, I seem to be a bit different." Wen Caishang pretended not to know: "You are different? Where are you different?"

Li Xian said: "I can leap two zhangs and eight chi."

Wen Caishang’s joy flashed, feeling great comfort, yet also a hidden sense of guilt. She said in surprise: "Oh? Try it for me." Li Xian施展 the "Golden Light Art," turning his body into flowing light and leaping a distance of two zhangs and eight chi.

Although Wen Caishang knew Li Xian was different, seeing it with her own eyes again, she felt extremely strange. From ancient times, those who consumed the Golden Scales, Yellow Nine Ginseng, and Morning Yellow Dew to obtain the Art of Golden Light were all sixteen feet. Why are you the only one with two zhangs and eight chi?

Wen Caishang thought to herself: "Could it be that my Li Lang’s talent is truly this powerful? He possesses the Perfect Physique and also the Heavy Pupil Physique. Having two physiques in one body is rare in the world. It is indeed difficult to measure by common sense. My husband should be just like this."

She secretly rejoiced. Having tested him, she asked truthfully: "Li Lang, why is your Golden Light so strong? Do you know the reason?"

Li Xian said: "I do not know either. I followed the Mistress’s instructions and consumed the Spirit Treasures as usual. Naturally, it became two zhangs and eight chi. I thought all Golden Light was like this. It was only because the Mistress reminded me that I knew I was special."

Wen Caishang laughed lightly and said: "Alas, my Li Lang, with such talent, you will surely surpass me in the future."

Li Xian’s scalp tingled, thinking: "You old witch, if my cultivation approaches yours, you will definitely cause trouble again. How could you allow me to surpass you?" He said: "The scenery of the martial path is indeed tempting. But I prefer the Mistress’s soft embrace."

Wen Caishang’s eyes brightened: "You, you are the most deceitful with your words. If I believed you, I’m afraid even this dress would be tricked away by you."

She loved to hear sweet words and did not think about their truth. When she was with Li Xian, she found it hard to use her schemes. Sometimes she was even deceived.

She continued: "Well, this matter cannot be verified. Not everything in the world needs to be made clear. You have this fortunate opportunity, so accept it well."

"Since you have already obtained the Way of Arts, I am your half-teacher in matters related to it, and I should explain them clearly to you."

Li Xian immediately asked for instruction. Wen Caishang said: "The Way of Arts is the敕权 of heaven and earth, with endless marvelous effects. The施展 of the Way of Arts consumes one’s own physical strength."

"The Way of Arts must be used according to one’s ability. If you use it forcefully or excessively, there is the danger of exhaustion and death. Some people are born with great physical strength, so they can施展 the Way of Arts more easily. It needs to be determined by the individual."

"And the Way of Arts can also be practiced like martial arts, adding to the skillful and marvelous use of the Way of Arts. For example, your Golden Light Art, turning your body into flowing light and leaping a zhang or so. Moving positions horizontally and vertically is naturally extremely easy and does not need to be practiced in detail."

"But if there is a wall in front of you, can you pass through it?"

Li Xian possessed the "Perfect Physique" and the "Heavy Pupil Physique," both of which were beneficial to his physical strength. At this time, his recovery was complete, and he could施展 the Way of Arts without hindrance. Seeing a wall, he immediately turned into golden light and leaped towards it.

The wall blocked him, stopping the flowing light. Li Xian’s figure reappeared and asked: "Mistress, according to your meaning, if I practice hard, I can leap through the light and pass through the wall?"

Wen Caishang did not answer, but continued: "There is a screen over there. Try to pass through it."

That screen was woven from silkworm threads, extremely exquisite, embroidered with a phoenix spreading its wings. Li Xian walked to the front of the screen, turned into flowing light, and was also blocked by the screen. However, hundreds of tiny halos passed through the gaps in the screen.

Li Xian’s figure reappeared and said: "I cannot pass through, but..." Wen Caishang said: "As far as I know, the Way of Arts Golden Light can pass through screens. The screen is woven from silk threads, with tiny gaps inside. If you can turn into golden light and pass through the gaps, then reassemble, you can penetrate the screen and reach the inside."

"Similarly... if this wall has gaps or holes, and you control the Golden Light properly, you can钻过 gaps and tiny holes like light, entering the area behind the wall. But this matter requires practice."

Li Xian said: "I see."

Wen Caishang said: "Li Lang, please施展 the Golden Light Art and pass by my side." Li Xian did as he was told, instantly turning into light and flying past. Wen Caishang smiled slightly, and with two fingers, she pinched the flowing light.

The flowing light immediately stopped, as if obstructed, caught between her slender jade fingers. The flowing light still wanted to escape, but it was truly difficult to escape the power of the two fingers. Helplessly, it reassembled and took on its form. It turned out that Wen Caishang’s light pinch had actually caught Li Xian’s wrist.

Wen Caishang laughed: "Turning into flowing light, it has form but no substance. Ordinary blades and swords naturally cannot cut it, and ordinary fists and feet naturally cannot touch it. This move of mine is called 'Intercepting Spring Hand'."

"When practiced to the profound level, one can intercept a natural touch of spring intent and hold it in one’s hand. Among them is a move called 'Retaining the Sun.' It is a move that can pinch a halo."

"Watch."

Wen Caishang waved her sleeve. The lanterns in the courtyard all went out, and it became instantly dark. She rolled up her sleeve and gently pinched the moonlight. As if picking a flower, she "picked" a wisp of moonlight. The moonlight remained at her fingertips for a long time without dispersing. Wen Caishang连续施展 moves, pinching the light several times. The moonlight brewed in her palm, becoming quite bright and shimmering.

She waved her sleeve again. The moonlight scattered with a "clatter," and the courtyard instantly became bright. Moonlight filled the hall, truly strange. Li Xian saw this peerless technique and could only sigh in admiration.

She said: "This move restrains your Golden Light Art. Even if you turn into golden light, have form but no substance, and your methods are unpredictable, I can still pinch the Golden Light with a single finger of 'Retaining the Sun,' and intercept you."

"You have just obtained the Way of Arts and are naturally delighted. This is understandable. But you cannot be negligent or too dependent on it because of this. As far as I know, in the泷雄道, there is a sect called the 'Chasing Sun Blade Gate,' which掌握 a martial art called 'Chasing Sun Severing Gap Blade'."

"This martial art is rumored to be able to sever light. If you施展 this Golden Light Art in front of them, even if you turn into golden light, you can still be injured."

Li Xian deeply felt enlightened, and his horizons expanded again. He said: "Thank you, Mistress, for teaching me. If the Mistress had not taught me, I’m afraid I would only understand this principle after suffering a loss. The Golden Light Art allows me to turn into flowing light, shuttle and dodge, and preserve my life with the Art. But there are martial artists who can intercept light, retain light, sever light, and break light..."

Wen Caishang laughed: "Your comprehension is very good, you understand with a single hint. Knowing its strengths and weaknesses is a good thing, but you don’t need to favor one over the other. A martial artist’s methods depend entirely on their own cultivation. You have obtained the Art of Golden Light. If you encounter a Third Realm martial artist who neither knows the Intercepting Spring Hand nor the Chasing Sun Severing Gap Blade, you can naturally use the Golden Light to maneuver. Even if he is a realm higher than you, it would not be easy for him to capture you. But the Golden Light consumes a great deal of physical strength. If you are in a long stalemate, you will ultimately be at a disadvantage."

Li Xian knew that Wen Caishang was imparting combat experience. He memorized it in his heart and felt deeply grateful. Wen Caishang continued: "Similarly... the Golden Light Art is compatible with several martial arts. I have a scroll called 'Flick of a Finger Golden Light,' which is a mid-grade martial art. If you like it, I can teach it to you."

Li Xian said joyfully: "Thank you, Mistress."

Wen Caishang said with a soft laugh: "Between you and me, why is there a need for thanks? I hurt you during the day and feel very guilty. If you like it, take it." She turned her sleeve, and a scroll lay quietly on the table.

Li Xian took it and looked at it, finding it very profound. He felt both love and fear for Wen Caishang. "Why is it that I, of all people, have encountered such a complicated matter? I do not want to betray her, but I also cannot allow her to harm me. I must do everything I can to improve my strength, to surpass her, to conquer her."

Li Xian put away the "Flick of a Finger Golden Light" and looked at the empty room in the pavilion. He said: "This martial art is excellent, but I am greedy. At this moment, I would rather ask you to teach me the third level of the sword art."

Wen Caishang was elegant and dignified, her temperament outstanding, her affection sincere. She understood the hidden meaning in his words. The third level of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword required two people to cultivate together. It did not cultivate the sword, but cultivated emotion and desire.

She opened her arms as if to embrace him, open and enchanting, passionate yet natural. She laughed: "If you want to learn, how could I not teach you?"
