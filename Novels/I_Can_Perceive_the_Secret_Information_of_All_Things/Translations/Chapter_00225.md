# Chapter 225: The Valley of Tremors

The border between the human and demon races stretched vast and long. According to ancient accords, a two-thousand-mile buffer zone extended outward from their shared boundary line—a no-man's land where neither side could establish cities or station troops.  

Over time, these borderlands became training grounds for both races, where minor skirmishes occurred frequently.  

The Valley of Tremors was one such place.  

Its terrain was complex—flat plains, deep valleys, winding rivers, and rolling hills...  

To both races, this place was utterly ordinary.
