# Chapter 62: The Final Farewell

In the mind of the second-tier Winged Tigress, the last of her bloodline seemed doomed to fall into human hands.  

There were two possible fates for her cub: either taken by the cultivator currently cradling it, or seized by the hammer-wielding cultivator.  

And these two groups clearly weren't on good terms.  

Different choices would lead to different outcomes.  

Instinctively, if the cub fell into the hands of the hammer-wielding Foundation Establishment cultivator, its fate would likely be grim. Such a man treated demonic beasts as mere livestock, devoid of any compassion.  

The one holding the cub, however, carried far less hostility.  

Observing how gently he treated the cub, it was clear this cultivator had a softer heart. The cub seemed at ease in his arms, even comfortable.  

The choice became obvious.  

The Winged Tigress resolved to expend her last remaining strength to deliver a final blow to the Foundation Establishment cultivator. As for the outcome—she could only leave it to fate.  

Xiao Ji, perceiving the tigress's thoughts, understood her intentions.  

This was an opportunity.  

With just him and the burden that was Qian Duoyu, defeating a Foundation Establishment cultivator was impossible.  

Though the gap between Peak Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment was just a single Foundation Establishment Pill, the difference in strength was vast—comprehension, speed, power, everything was leagues apart.  

But with the tigress as a wildcard, the situation could turn.  

To ensure the second-tier tigress's final strike would have maximum effect, Xiao Ji deliberately drew the attention of the hammer-wielding cultivator, Brutal Might.  

"Do you know who I am?" Xiao Ji stood with his hands behind his back, exuding an air of arrogance.  

Brutal Might studied Xiao Ji for a moment but didn't recognize him. "Who are you?"  

"Who I am isn't important," Xiao Ji replied calmly. "Do you know where I come from?"  

Brutal Might set his hammer down, pondered, then shook his head.  

"Good," Xiao Ji nodded. "Then, do you know where I'm going?"  

"Speak plainly. I don't have time for riddles," Brutal Might growled, tightening his grip on the hammer's handle.  

He sensed the young man was stalling.  

But what use was that? In this desolate place, life and death were decided by strength alone.  

"These three questions are difficult, yet simple," Xiao Ji said with deliberate profundity. "I am Xiao Ji, from the Primordial Spirit Temple, and I am heading to the Ancient City of Tai."  

"You're dead!" Brutal Might raised his hammer and unleashed a devastating blast of energy toward Xiao Ji.  

The attack struck like a cannonball, shattering a massive boulder ahead.  

Xiao Ji, having anticipated the strike, barely dodged in time, expending all his spiritual energy to avoid being obliterated.  

The difference in power was too great.  

"A mere Qi Refinement cultivator, yet you dodged my attack. You have some skill," Brutal Might sneered, his killing intent flaring. "But next time, you'll die horribly."  

At that moment—  

The Winged Tigress, the second-tier beast lying half-dead on the ground, suddenly sprang up. Its wings spread wide, and with a mighty flap, a gale erupted. Trees bent, stones flew, and chaos erupted.  

Brutal Might turned in alarm, raising his hammer to block—but too late.  

As he spun around, all he saw was a massive, bloodied body and a paw the size of a boulder slamming into his chest.  

Even with his spiritual energy shielding him, he couldn't withstand the fatal blow.  

His hammer fell. His body was sent flying like a firework—first a deafening *bang* as he was struck, then a second as he crashed into a stone wall.  

**[Now.]**  

Xiao Ji's Thunderbolt Sword flashed from its sheath, streaking toward the Foundation Establishment cultivator. With his weapon lost and his body trapped, Brutal Might was defenseless.  

Xiao Ji's sword energy sealed the flow of spiritual energy around him, and in a single motion, he slashed a "井" character in the air—two horizontal and two vertical cuts—slicing the man into nine pieces.  

The battle ended in the blink of an eye.  

Qian Duoyu barely registered the fight before realizing it was already over.  

As Xiao Ji sheathed his sword, a sudden unease gripped him. "Wait."  

He turned to see the Winged Tigress, driven by sheer willpower, rise one last time and charge, smashing into Brutal Might's already dismembered remains.  

Blood and gore splattered across the stone wall.  

"Pity," Xiao Ji sighed. "That Foundation Establishment cultivator must have carried treasures. Now they're all ruined." He shot a displeased glance at the tigress.  

The beast understood. With its last strength, it plunged a claw into its own abdomen and pulled out a bloodied, irregular white stone—its demon core.  

Its eyes locked onto Xiao Ji.  

Xiao Ji was stunned. A demon core was a rare and precious treasure.  

The tigress was offering it to him, clearly hoping they would care for the last of its bloodline.  

Xiao Ji didn't take it immediately. Instead, he studied the tigress, sensing its final thoughts.  

**[It wants to see its child one last time.]**  

"Brother Qian," Xiao Ji said, "let it see the cub. Let it pass in peace, lest its resentment taint the land."  

Qian Duoyu nodded and brought the cub close to the dying beast.  

**[It thanks you, though it can no longer speak. It truly wishes you to understand.]**  

"You're welcome," Xiao Ji said to the tigress.  

Qian Duoyu had no idea why Xiao Ji was speaking to a corpse, but he didn't question it.  

The Winged Tigress finally closed its eyes, at peace—though a single tear of blood rolled down its cheek.  

"You take the demon core," Xiao Ji said. "It doesn't belong to me."  

Qian Duoyu had already considered this. He wanted to keep it for the cub, to gift it when the young beast grew strong enough to understand.  

Perhaps he'd craft it into a bell or some other precious keepsake.  

"Brother Xiao, this trip to the Nine Nether Valley was worth it," Qian Duoyu said.  

"For me as well," Xiao Ji agreed. "But we shouldn't linger. Let's go."  

According to the maps, the Nine Nether Valley wasn't supposed to be this dangerous. Second-tier beasts hadn't appeared here in years. But now, things were changing.  

As the Great Calamity approached, all creatures would undergo transformations. Demonic beasts would grow more active.  

Until he reached Foundation Establishment, Xiao Ji decided, he wouldn't return to this place.  

On the journey back, Xiao Ji asked, "What are your plans now?"  

He hoped to inspire Qian Duoyu to voice another wish—another opportunity for profit.  

Once they returned to the Ancient City of Tai, Qian Duoyu would pay him for the escort. But if the young master could be persuaded to splurge a little more, that would be ideal.  

"I'm going home," Qian Duoyu said. "I'll raise the cub well and focus on my cultivation. This trip proved that weaklings like me shouldn't wander recklessly."  

Pill-based cultivation didn't require much effort, but prolonged reliance led to resistance and side effects.  

"Home can wait," Xiao Ji suggested. "Why not visit the auction house first? Buy some premium beast milk for your new pet, or maybe a toy..."
