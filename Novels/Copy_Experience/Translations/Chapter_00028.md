# Chapter 28: Crisis in Green Lake Market

The Black Robe Society!

Lu Xu heard that name once again. The moment he saw them appear, a great unease welled up in his heart. The scent of conspiracy permeated from all directions.

"Tan Hu, no doubt, must be from the Black Robe Society!"

"And that fishmonger, Vendor Gao, is also suspicious. They've long infiltrated the market. Are they gathering intelligence, monitoring the Mo family?"

"According to Yin Yu, the Black Robe Society appeared a few years ago. Having lain dormant here for so many years, what exactly are they planning?"

Lu Xu instantly felt that this sudden appearance of the Divine Wood Sect ruins was probably not so simple. It might very well be a massive conspiracy.

"The situation is getting more and more complicated. Now is not the time to act rashly. I absolutely cannot stick my neck out!"

Thinking this, Lu Xu quickly merged into the mortal town. After using the Bronze Mask to sculpt a new face, Lu Xu changed his appearance again, swapped clothes, and flew towards the Green Lake Market.

He didn't dare to hide in the mortal town, because the figures in black robes were already approaching it. If these people started searching, the situation would be dire, so it was better to leave. The safest place now was the Green Lake Market. It was protected by a second-tier grand formation. Although Lu Xu harbored some doubts about whether the grand formation could truly protect the market, with a large number of cultivators gathered there, it was generally safer.

The formation at the market had already been activated, bringing back the Mo family's patrolling guards. Lu Xu and other rogue cultivators also blended in. The Black Robe Society members were still pressing forward, but they didn't seem to be in a hurry to attack Green Lake Market, merely herding the cultivators outside into it.

"Stop! These rogue cultivators are not allowed to leave! They just tried to escape; there must be spies among them!" A cold shout suddenly came as they entered the market. Then, a middle-aged man in a white robe quickly walked over, his gaze sharp as he swept it across the crowd. Immediately after, his expression suddenly changed. He looked at the group again and again, somewhat panicked: "Where's Qingyuan? Why haven't I seen him return?"

Seeing that faintly familiar face, Lu Xu realized this might be Mo Qingyuan's father, Mo Family Elder Mo Changzong. Mo Qingyuan had been killed by him, but Lu Xu wasn't flustered in the slightest. The one who killed Mo Qingyuan was that cold, black-robed youth from before. What did that have to do with him, now a green-robed man with temples streaked with gray? Lu Xu glanced around and noticed that Old Xu had changed his face, and was standing in a different direction from his grandson. It seemed he also understood that he couldn't appear here with the same face he had at the scene of Mo Qingyuan's death.

With Mo Changzong's loud shout, the Mo family cultivators immediately surrounded the dozens of rogue cultivators. The crowd began to stir. The commotion here had already attracted many rogue cultivators to come and watch. When they saw the black-robed figures outside, the market immediately erupted in commotion, with exclamations and chatter, as people grew uneasy. Everyone realized that the situation seemed rather grim.

A Mo family cultivator went up to Mo Changzong and whispered something. Mo Changzong's face instantly turned ashen, and his hands trembled uncontrollably. "My son is dead, and the murderer is among you!" Mo Changzong's eyes were bloodshot, staring fixedly at the group before him, as if he wanted to devour them all. "Seize them all! I want to interrogate them thoroughly!" In his rage, he issued this command.

"Mo Changzong, are you serious?" Among the rogue cultivators, a brawny man stepped out and coldly shouted. The aura emanating from this person had already reached the eighth level of Qi Condensation. Following his statement, Yin Yu and several other late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators also took a step forward, coldly watching the Mo family members.

In an instant, the atmosphere throughout the market changed. Not only did Lu Xu and others secretly grip their magic tools, ready to strike, but even the eyes of some cultivators watching from afar flickered. If the Mo family wanted to capture these rogue cultivators, they would definitely resist. There were some tough characters among them; even the Mo family might not find it easy to subdue them. Speaking of which, how many strong cultivators were left in the Mo family's ancestral land now? The Mo family ancestor had led over a hundred people out, leaving the Mo family vulnerable. If chaos erupted now...

Chaos was a ladder! The cultivation world never lacked ambitious individuals. They were like hungry wolves, fixated on the Mo family, ready to pounce and take a brutal bite the moment they spotted a weakness.

"Stop!" A clear, cold shout came, followed by the appearance of a figure in a black dress. Mo Qingchan! Her fair face was filled with solemnity: "Release these people, let them go!"

"Qingchan, do you know what you're saying?" Mo Changzong roared in sudden fury upon hearing this.

"Seventh Uncle, I'll explain the specific reasons to you later. For now, I order you on behalf of the Family Head: you must not hinder these rogue cultivators from leaving!" A hint of authority appeared on Mo Qingchan's face. Upon hearing this, some of the Mo family guards showed hesitation, some remained motionless, while others immediately obeyed the command.

As they moved aside, a gap appeared in the encirclement, and Lu Xu and dozens of other rogue cultivators immediately left the area through it. After blending into the market crowd, they instantly disappeared. A potential conflict was averted, but the atmosphere between the two factions of the Mo family grew tense. Arguments and angry shouts faintly rose, and after a moment, Mo Changzong huffily turned and left, his face ashen.

As he reached the Mo family's ancestral land, he suddenly seemed to remember something, and casting a sound amplification spell, he shouted throughout the entire market: "Whoever can provide clues about the murder of my son, Mo Qingyuan, I will reward them with a bottle of Qi Nourishing Pills!"

"Hehe, you can take your time looking!" Lu Xu was already back in his small building at this moment. Hearing the sound, he chuckled. He took out Mo Qingyuan's storage bag and meticulously examined it.

"Miss, with such a great enemy before us, the most important thing is to unite as many forces as possible. How could Elder Changzong say such things?" Mo Fatty, having approached Mo Qingchan at some point, said with a face full of anger.

"If he had any sense of the bigger picture, he wouldn't have failed to secure the family head position back then!" Mo Qingchan's face was cold. She looked outside the market, where dozens of black-robed figures were vaguely encircling it in the distance. This group had already surrounded the market, preventing anyone from leaving. Faint sounds of intense spell battles drifted from the mortal town, indicating that some people, still hoping for a chance, had not left and were captured.

Mo Qingchan knew the enemies outside the market were far more numerous than this; hundreds of Black Robe Society members had appeared from all directions. The Black Robe Society was one of the two major rogue cultivator organizations in Wei Kingdom, ranking higher than the Mo family among the nine major powers. The Mo family was definitely no match for this organization. It was likely that the Mo family would not be able to avoid this great catastrophe. The most important thing now was: how was that Foundation Establishment Ancestor? As long as that person was safe and sound, this market would be impregnable, and the Black Robe Society would be utterly unable to conquer it. But if something had happened to that person, then...

Deep worry clouded Mo Qingchan's eyes. She sighed softly: "Ever since the Green Robe Three Brothers appeared, I felt something was off with these rogue cultivators. I never expected it to be the Black Robe Society!"

"It seems all those powerful rogue cultivators who emerged over the years were deliberately testing our strength, especially testing if the Ancestor could still take action!"

"Miss, so that Divine Wood Sect ruins..." Mo Fatty's eyes held a hint of fear as he spoke.

"It's probably a trap. This 'luring the tiger away from the mountain' tactic directly drew away the Mo family's strongest force. It's hateful. If only I had gotten more clues earlier, perhaps I could have persuaded the Ancestor!" Mo Qingchan's face showed strong unwillingness.

"Why would the Black Robe Society target our Mo family? What good would that do them?" Mo Fatty was full of confusion.

"Someone said they were enforcers secretly cultivated by the Thousand Desolations Sect!"

"Then what about the Black Robe Society raiding the Thousand Desolations Sect market back then?" Mo Fatty's eyes widened instantly.

"Hmph, it was just an act. Otherwise, with the Thousand Desolations Sect's strength, how could they not even eradicate a rogue cultivator organization!"

"Thousand Desolations Sect! Thousand Desolations Sect! Why would they go so far? Is there really such deep hatred between our two families?" Mo Fatty paced back and forth, utterly perplexed.

A hint of worry flashed in Mo Qingchan's eyes. There were some things she didn't tell Mo Fatty. The Green Lake Mo family and the Black Robe Society were, in reality, just two chess pieces pushed to the forefront. Behind them lay a deeper game, concerning the most fundamental conflicts within the Wei Kingdom's cultivation world.

"So poor, can't even compare to Tan Hu!" Lu Xu thought, somewhat speechless, as he looked at Mo Qingyuan's storage bag. Spirit stones, he only found over 130 pieces. Talismans, there wasn't a single one left; all had been used up in battle. He did find a half-used bottle of Qi Nourishing Pills, with three pills remaining, which was worth something.

"This fan is a fine example among mid-grade magic tools, similar to Tan Hu's Profound Rock Seal and my Azure Radiance Sword, but I wouldn't dare use it openly!"

"Oh, is this a flying magic tool?" Lu Xu's face finally broke into a smile after he pulled out a small, green boat-shaped magic tool from the storage bag. He recognized the identity of this magic tool at a glance. It was the Thousand Mechanisms Hall's standard flying magic tool, the Azure Wind Boat, valued at five hundred spirit stones per unit, and critically, very difficult to buy. Its raw material came from two century-old Azure Wind Wood trees felled in the Myriad Beast Mountain Range thirty years ago. Six Azure Wind Boats were refined from this wood at the time. It was said that four of them had fallen into the Mo family's hands. He never expected that one would now be in his possession.

This was indeed a rare and valuable flying magic tool. Generally speaking, among magic tools, offensive types were the most common and lowest priced, followed by defensive types. Flying and auxiliary types were extremely rare. Often, one couldn't buy them even if one wanted to. He never expected to obtain one so easily now. For Lu Xu, this was simply a timely blessing!

After purifying this Azure Wind Boat with his own magical power and leaving his imprint, Lu Xu put it away. Continuing to rummage through the storage bag, he found another book: "Geography of the Eastern Desolation Nations."

"The Nine Nations of the Eastern Desolation." Lu Xu's face showed interest as he read the descriptions in the book. The land he was in was called the Eastern Desolation. To its west was the Myriad Beast Mountain Range, stretching continuously north to south, cutting off communication between the Eastern Desolation and the outside world. The northern and southern ends were vast, boundless oceans. Going east, there was another massive mountain range. However, this mountain range had no demonic beasts and wasn't as unfathomable as the Myriad Beast Mountain Range, allowing for easy passage. But after crossing it, one would face a vast desert that seemed to have no end. The Eastern Desolation region was isolated from external communication. On this land enveloped by deserts, mountains, and oceans, there were a total of nine nations. Wei Kingdom was one of them.

Lu Xu focused on the introduction to Wei Kingdom: its nine major powers, the Thousand Desolations Sect, the Imperial Wei Family, White Mountain Sect, Liangshan Wang Family, and so on. Only in the last part did he see the Green Lake Mo family.

"The Green Lake Mo family is almost the weakest among the nine major powers. I wonder if they can survive this tribulation!" Lu Xu thought as he closed the book.

He disposed of all Mo Qingyuan's miscellaneous items and put all his valuable possessions into his own storage bag. After carefully handling everything, Lu Xu quietly waited for dawn. This night was destined to be unpeaceful. He wondered how the Mo family planned to deal with the black-robed figures outside the market. Could a mere second-tier grand formation truly stop them?
