# Chapter 59: The Genius Li Mo, and the Method to Invest in Jiang Chulong!

"You didn't have to bring a gift even though you came."

"Brother Li, please don't say that. This is merely this old man's token of appreciation."

Mu Ronghai handed over the gift without hesitation.

He was very glad that his grandson had a pure and good nature, getting along quite well with this Brother Li.

Brother Li was definitely superior to the heirs of those great sects and blessed caves in the Eastern Wilderness Domain.

"There is another matter I must trouble you with."

Li Mo suddenly said.

"Please, speak freely."

Mu Ronghai was afraid that Li Mo wouldn't make any requests.

...

A moment later.

Mu Ronghai led Li Mo to the manor's training grounds.

Many clan disciples were practicing their techniques there. Seeing the Clan Head arrive, they immediately stopped their movements and bowed.

In the center of the training grounds stood a coral stone three people high.

"This is Whale Breath Coral Stone. In the Eastern Wilderness Domain, it is quite a rare item."

"The only advantage of this object is its solidity. Furthermore, it changes color according to the force it receives. After being treated with a special method, it can be used to test attack intensity."

Mu Ronghai pointed at the coral stone and explained.

"That is quite rare."

Li Mo reached out and touched the rough reef stone.

"I haven't used it yet."

Mu Rongxiao said eagerly. In the past, his strength was too low to make the Whale Breath Coral Stone change color.

He acted immediately.

Gathering all his strength, he tensed his body and threw a punch like a cannon hammer. One could even see a shadow of blacksmith hammering techniques.

*Thump—*

A dull sound rang out.

The dark coral stone instantly dyed white, covering roughly eighty percent of the stone's surface.

"Xiao'er's strike is almost comparable to the Tenth Pulse of the Blood Qi Realm."

Mu Ronghai nodded in satisfaction.

"So white represents the Blood Qi Realm..."

Li Mo nodded slightly.

Currently, he actually lacked a comprehensive understanding of his own strength.

He could use this opportunity to test it.

"Grandfather Mu Rong, won't I break this coral stone?"

"Brother Li, please rest assured."

Mu Ronghai laughed. "Even if I were to go all out, I couldn't damage this thing."

"Good."

Li Mo nodded.

Without using any martial techniques, he threw a simple punch. In the air, a sonic boom could faintly be heard.

*Boom—*

The reef stone remained motionless.

However, the white light rapidly filled the stone, and then, from the bottom, a layer of cyan appeared.

"This must be because I bathed in the Phoenix Blood Pool, and plus the extra main meridians in my body, my Qi and Blood power are stronger, allowing me to achieve this result."

Li Mo thought to himself.

"Wow, Senior Brother Li is in the Blood Qi Realm, right? He didn't use Internal Qi just now."

"That punch is equivalent to the attack power of someone just entering the Internal Qi Condensing Realm?"

"Why is he so strong?"

The Mu Rong clan disciples watching the scene gasped in astonishment.

Their clan's Mu Rongxiao possessed half-demon bloodline, yet he didn't have such great strength.

"Brother Li is truly a man of divine strength."

Mu Ronghai appeared calm.

Compared to Brother Li's shocking talent, having a bit more strength was nothing.

But it didn't end there.

"Let's try adding the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body."

A sharp, killing intent spread from Li Mo's body.

The people around him looked at him as if he had transformed into a precious weapon. Their hair stood on end, as if a sharp sword hung above their heads.

*Boom—*

Another strike.

Sparks flew, a wave of air rolled out, and the sound of metal and stone lingered for a long time.

Dust from the roof fell in rustling layers.

Once the dust and smoke cleared...

Only... the Whale Breath Coral Stone had turned half cyan.

A Blood Qi Realm practitioner unleashing the attack power of the Internal Qi Jade Liquid Realm?

The vast training grounds fell silent in an instant.

"Xiao'er."

It took Mu Ronghai a long time to come to his senses.

"Yeah?" Mu Rongxiao closed his gaping mouth.

"Didn't you say that Brother Li's strongest suit is actually swordsmanship?"

---

"It should... be?"

...

Nightfall.

In the guest courtyard.

Li Mo shook the dust off his clothes before pushing the door open.

He didn't continue testing.

Understanding himself completely was enough.

Martial arts are, after all, based on one's own strength, then further amplified.

He didn't need to test to know.

"If I had a suitable hammer..."

"I should be able to fight against the Internal Qi Xuan Dan Realm right now?"

This requires a small question mark.

Although his full-power strike right now definitely has the might of the Internal Qi Xuan Dan Realm.

He hasn't reached that realm yet, so he doesn't know if there are other means.

Besides, the Whale Breath Coral Stone is a dead object; a living person won't stand there and let you hit them.

Of course, if he were to reach the peak of the Blood Qi Realm, it would be a different story.

Because at that time, he might have a killer trump card.

Once his strength is sufficient, he could bring out the Pan Jie Luo Xin Hammer. Even if he could only unleash one strike, it would definitely be something the Internal Qi Realm couldn't withstand.

"So, I'm very strong now?"

Li Mo curled his lips into a smile, lay back on the bed with his hands behind his head, and looked at the ceiling, lost in thought.

Fighting above one's level was the treatment reserved for the Sons of Destiny.

Little Li isn't an ordinary person anymore, so he shouldn't be any worse than those disciples of major sects, right?

Suddenly.

He remembered that Grandfather Mu Rong had given him a gift.

So, he opened the wooden box by the bedside.

The items inside didn't fall outside Little Li's knowledge.

A Pulse Breaking Pill with four patterns.

A dark, fragrant piece of ancient wood. It was called wood because it had wood grain, but its luster looked more like jade.

And a booklet.

Li Mo wasn't interested in the pill. Without even looking at it, he picked up the wood next to it.

"Don't know what it's called, but this should be a rare treasure that nourishes the Soul Will."

"Items like this are usually very hard to come by."

Li Mo played with the wood, feeling a sense of physical and mental comfort.

Grandfather Mu Rong probably took out his most treasured possession?

But this thing... he doesn't have a use for it right now...

"Wait."

"Doesn't Senior Brother Xiao Qin have an old man by his side?"

Little Li's novel experience came into play again.

An old man usually exists in the form of a soul.

In this world, that is called a Soul Will.

As is well known, after sleeping for such a long time, the old man definitely needs this thing urgently.

"I can use this to invest in Senior Brother Xiao."

"A随身 old man..."

Li Mo played with the wooden block, his mind clear.

Suddenly.

A problem that had been bothering him for a long time seemed to flash with a spark of inspiration at this moment.

"That's it!"

"An old man!"

Li Mo's clever little brain came up with an idea.

He has a Small World.

And he can bring existences weaker than himself into the World Seed.

For example, Jiang Chulong.

If he finds an item and leaves the aura of the World Seed on it, it would allow the person on the other side to enter the World Seed no matter where they are.

As the master of the World Seed, this is definitely feasible.

Then...

Couldn't he also act as Jiang Chulong's '随身 old man'?

"I'm such a damn genius!"

Li Mo acted immediately.

After selecting through a pile of items, he finally picked out a ring.

The Ancient Meaning Ring.

Its style was ancient and simple, exquisite yet not like a product of this era. In short, it looked quite impressive. If sold as an antique, it would definitely fetch a good price.

The key was that it was durable, likely made of some rare metal today.

"Opening a backdoor..."

Li Mo held the Ancient Meaning Ring and connected with the World Seed.
