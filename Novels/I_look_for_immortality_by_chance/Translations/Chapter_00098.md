# Chapter 98: Three Hearts... Golden Seal!

*Clang!*

With a thought from Gu Yuan, the Green Lotus Seal activated instantly. A translucent lotus shadow, tinged with golden hues, materialized before him as a shield. Yet the silver fist, carrying immense force and razor-sharp sword energy, struck with such power that the lotus shadow trembled violently upon impact, its radiance dimming rapidly.

*Roar!*

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan channeled a trace of power from the Minor Titan Seal, infusing the Green Lotus Seal with an invisible force that stabilized it.

*Boom!*

*Clang!*

The silver fist struck several more times, each blow earth-shaking. But with the Minor Titan Seal's reinforcement, the Green Lotus Seal stood firm as if cast from metal, blocking every attack.

"A puppet?"

After these exchanges, Gu Yuan finally got a clear look at his assailant. It was a humanoid puppet, about ten feet tall, with smooth contours and fully articulated limbs. Its entire body was forged from gleaming silver metal, resembling a suit of dazzling armor. 

The silver armor was covered in sword-shaped runes, giving the puppet an aura of sharpness so intense it seemed capable of blinding anyone who gazed upon it.

"Puppet?"

"Boy, puppets can't move freely in the Annihilation Zone!"

Just as Gu Yuan voiced his surprise, a cold laugh echoed from within the silver puppet. The voice was eerily familiar, making Gu Yuan frown. "Sanfa Daoist?"

"Hah, so you recognize me, kid! Not bad!" 

The puppet's eyes flickered, its mouth curling into a chillingly human-like smirk.

"You're not dead?"

Gu Yuan's expression turned grave.

"Dead? Ha! The lifespan limit for Foundation Establishment cultivators is 450 years—that's the will of heaven! Who can defy it? Even Golden Core cultivators can't escape suppression in the Annihilation Zone; they can't live past 150 years here!"

"I merely used a trick to preserve a wisp of my remnant soul within this puppet, giving it a semblance of life. After all, I can't have just any stray dog barging into my cave and taking what's left of my legacy."

"In my life, I've killed countless people, but I respect true heroes. Dying at the hands of Shao Xiayang was simply a matter of skill—no complaints here. Such is the fate of a rogue cultivator!"

"But if some nobody thinks they can waltz in and take my Three Hearts Seal, they're delusional!"

"Boy, kill me, and you can take everything—including this Silver Sand Swordheart Puppet. Lose, and you'll join the skeletons outside!"

Though the puppet seemed sentient, after finishing its speech, the light in its eyes dimmed significantly, as if reverting to an inanimate object.

Yet its movements only grew fiercer.

With each punch, the sword runes on its armor blazed with light, coalescing into razor-sharp sword energy. The puppet's entire body resembled a massive, spiked ball of blades, charging straight at Gu Yuan.

*Whoosh!*

Gu Yuan flicked his sleeve, unleashing the full power of the Drifting Cloud Seal. Thick mist instantly enveloped the entire cave. 

But the puppet's eyes flared once more, as if Sanfa Daoist had revived within it. Its piercing gaze cut through the fog effortlessly, its massive frame continuing its relentless assault.

"A remnant soul, huh..."

Gu Yuan murmured softly before his expression hardened. He unleashed his full spiritual sense.

In the void, an invisible silver dragon materialized, claws bared as it lunged at the silver puppet.

"Peak-grade spiritual sense?!"

The puppet emitted Sanfa Daoist's shocked voice, which then twisted into mad laughter. 

"Interesting! More talented than I was in my youth!"

The puppet froze in place as all its runes ignited, their light converging into its eyes. A blurred silhouette of an old Daoist emerged, fingers pointed like a sword as it leaped from the puppet to meet the silver dragon.

*Roar!*

*Clang!*

The old Daoist's sword-light was dazzling and lethally precise, but the silver dragon fought back with equal ferocity, its roars echoing as it tore at its foe.

An invisible yet intensely violent battle raged within the cave.

Though the silver dragon was savage, the old Daoist's sword techniques were seasoned, and his spiritual presence seemed superior. Despite being a remnant, he suppressed the dragon, shattering its scales one by one until it wailed in pain.

Gu Yuan remained expressionless, channeling all his Qi into the Minor Titan Seal in his dantian.

The silver dragon roared excitedly, as if invigorated. Its scales regenerated, its body thickened, and its claws gleamed with a deadly edge.

"Cheating brat, taking advantage of my weakened state..."

"But fine, you've proven yourself worthy. Remember—'Three Hearts as One, Shatter Illusion for Clarity'!"

With a resigned sigh, the old Daoist's silhouette dissipated like mist, vanishing completely.

As the figure faded, all light left the silver puppet, rendering it motionless and lifeless.

Silence reclaimed the cave.

"Truly gone now?"

Still wary, Gu Yuan meticulously inspected the area using techniques from the Rogue Cultivator's Manual. Only after confirming no lingering threats did he relax. He placed a simple seal on the silver puppet, storing it in his spatial pouch before proceeding deeper into the cave.

The cave was modest—just a stone bed and a stone table beyond the cliff wall.

On the table lay two items: a plain jade box and a withered spatial pouch.

At the sight of the jade box, realization dawned on Gu Yuan, and excitement flashed in his eyes.

*Exhale...*

He took a deep breath, steadying his racing heart. After carefully examining the box for traps, he finally mustered his Qi to lift the lid.

The lid was heavy, weighing nearly a thousand pounds, but Gu Yuan's cultivation allowed him to raise it steadily.

*Clang!*

Instantly, a brilliant golden light erupted, dazzling as a miniature sun, illuminating the entire cave.

"The Immortal Golden Seal!"

"So it's true—the final legacy of a Golden Core master, the condensation of their golden essence!"

Inside the jade box rested a small golden seal, its surface adorned with countless cloud motifs and ancient inscriptions. It radiated an eternal aura, as if embodying immortality itself.

A Golden Seal!

The Three Hearts Seal was actually a Golden Seal!

Among the countless families of the Azure Peak Dao Sect, only five could claim the title of "Great Clans." The reason? Each had produced a Golden Core master. Upon death, such masters left behind an immortal seal—a crystallization of their golden essence, carrying a trace of eternity. Unless destroyed by overwhelming force, these seals endured indefinitely.

These Golden Seals became the greatest treasures of their clans.

If a clan member refined the seal, they would inherit one of the Golden Core master's most powerful techniques. Even if their cultivation wasn't sufficient to unleash its full might, wielding the seal made them virtually invincible among peers.

A Foundation Establishment cultivator at the peak, armed with the seal, supplemented by formations and artifacts, could even withstand attacks from a Golden Core master, ensuring their clan's survival.

This was true heritage.

And now, Gu Yuan was about to possess one.

"No wonder the Three Hearts Seal is one of the Three Methods Sect's most guarded legacies, yet so few have mastered it... It's a Golden Seal..."

He had assumed it was merely a rare body-refining seal. Who knew it was a Golden Core body seal?

Then again, how could a Qi Refining cultivator possibly craft a seal capable of altering one's innate aptitude?

Body-refining seals were inherently profound.

*Clang!*

Gu Yuan reached for the seal, only to be repelled by an inexplicable force.

A cold voice echoed in his mind:

*"Blood upon the seal. Chant the incantation."*

The incantation?

Recalling Sanfa Daoist's final words, Gu Yuan understood. He exhaled deeply, pricked his finger, and let a drop of blood fall onto the seal as he recited:

*"Three Hearts as One, Shatter Illusion for Clarity!"*

*Boom!*

The Golden Seal trembled, erupting in a radiant glow.
