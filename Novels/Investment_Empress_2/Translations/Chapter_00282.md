# Chapter 282: Has the Ice Cube Learned to Be Naughty?

“Is your Hundred Flavors Fruit sweet?”

“It’s sweet.”

“Turn your face over here.”

“Alright... but the taste is a bit strange...”

Li Mo had just taken a bite of the fruit. He guessed that his handsome face was currently twisted into a grimace, so he turned his head to the side.

To put it simply, he tasted a sense of “vicissitudes of life” from the fruit. Is that a flavor a fruit should have?

He really shouldn't have eaten anything the Ice Cube handed him...

But then again.

Such a cold and aloof Ice Cube, holding out a heart to you—what kind of person could withstand such a test?

“But it tastes fine to me...”

Ying Bing took a light bite of her own fruit, her cheeks moving slightly.

“Pretty sweet.”

“Then let me taste yours.”

Li Mo leaned over suspiciously and took a bite from the fruit in her hand. Immediately, his expression turned ferocious, as if he had just eaten a particularly sour black plum.

“Ice Cube, you’re dealing a thousand damage to the enemy while taking a thousand damage yourself...”

Li Mo opened his mouth, wanting to spit it out.

*Smack—*

A fair, cool hand covered his mouth.

Li Mo’s eyes widened. He clearly saw the corner of the girl’s mouth curl up, revealing a faint dimple.

The Ice Cube had learned to be naughty.

Since she wasn't playing by the rules, Li Mo didn't have to act like a gentleman either.

“This fruit...”

Ying Bing was about to explain, but a warm sensation spread from her palm, like a faint electric current flowing through her entire body.

She couldn't help but purse her lips and shrink her swan-like neck back slightly.

“Hehe...”

Li Mo was feeling quite pleased with himself.

Suddenly, he felt a warm sensation surge from his Dantian, reaching straight for his heart.

Flowing into his heart and making the lake of his heart ripple... were emotions?

He seemed to see a young boy and girl standing under a Marriage Tree. The boy was high-spirited, saying he would go to the Southern Pass to build a career and return to make her the General’s wife. But when the girl came again, she was left wearing only white mourning clothes, hanging a bamboo plaque on the tree branch.

He saw childhood sweethearts, happy and content, making a lifelong promise under the Marriage Tree, only to be separated by war. They reunited under the tree to pray when their hair had turned white, yet they didn't recognize each other.

There was also a little monk who skipped morning lessons to play, only to meet the most beautiful and fantastical Blue Phoenix under the Marriage Tree.

Later, he became the Abbot of Xuankong Temple, spending half his life trying to forget that one second...

These were the flavors he had tasted.

“There is the power of the common people inside this fruit, the flavors of a hundred lives. That is why it is called the Hundred Flavors Fruit.”

“It is incredibly effective for strengthening the Soul of Will.”

Along with the girl’s voice came the pure brilliance of the Great Yin and the divine light of the Jade Phoenix.

Thus, within the ocean of emotions, Li Mo’s true heart no longer wavered.

Maintaining the Flood Dragon form, or any other demonic transformation, usually yielded very little effect when cultivating the Soul of Will.

But right now, Li Mo felt his Soul of Will stirring restlessly.

Moreover, the effect was immediate, surpassing all the heavenly treasures he had eaten before.

The cool little hand was also taken away.

“The power of the common people?”

Li Mo could finally speak normally.

“Mm. If one bears incense and offerings, receiving the faith of others, one will accept the power of the common people.”

Ying Bing curled her fingers, hiding her hands behind her back, and said nonchalantly:

“The method of viewing oneself as a god usually involves devouring the power of the common people to strengthen the Soul of Will.”

“Like those half-demons,” Li Mo said thoughtfully.

He finally understood what he had seen on Wuling Mountain that day. That was why he had asked Wu Dameng to act in a play. By extension, fear also breeds the power of the common people.

When those commoners felt fear, they would become even more dependent on and worship the so-called Wuling, providing even more faith.

He had only taken two bites of the Hundred Flavors Fruit, and his Soul of Will had already grown visibly.

If he could obtain it long-term, just how fast would his cultivation progress be?

---

As if sensing his thoughts, Ying Bing said seriously:

“This shortcut has enormous drawbacks. Otherwise, the Demon Summoning Sect wouldn't be considered a demonic sect.”

“Ah? Then the fruit we ate...”

“The Hundred Flavors Fruit takes thousands of years to bloom and bear fruit. It is extremely pure. It’s fine to eat one.”

Li Mo finally put his mind at ease.

He looked at the fruit in his hand. He knew this thing was precious; eating the whole thing might even allow him to break through.

He gritted his teeth and wanted to eat it, but he was afraid he wouldn't be able to stop himself from throwing up.

“Ice Cube, help me out.”

“Okay,” Ying Bing thought they were going to dual-cultivate, so she reached out to hold his hand.

Li Mo shook his head and pouted. “Here.”

He figured covering it himself probably wouldn't work well.

Ying Bing pressed her lips together. “Just find something to cover it. It’s the same.”

“This fruit is too gross. I can’t eat it unless it’s with something good.”

Li Mo said this very seriously. He had been thinking about the whole process of eating that bite of the Hundred Flavors Fruit.

“?”

Ying Bing looked at him expressionlessly. Why didn't she just tell her to stick her foot in his mouth?

But after lowering her eyes and thinking for a moment, she couldn't resist his look of a righteous gentleman. She figured she might as well just touch his face.

“No sticking out your tongue...”

“I promise!” Li Mo said firmly, his eyes resolute.

Unless he couldn't help it.

And so.

Li Mo and the Ice Cube’s new dual-cultivation pose +1.

“Hm? What are they doing?”

Wu Dameng had been looking for Li Mo for a while. He was planning to leave the Southern Frontier with the Xuankong Temple soon and wanted to bid farewell to Brother Li.

Wu Qing and Murong Feng, his parents, had come with him. Seeing the scene before them, they immediately stopped and pulled back their son, who was about to step forward and ask.

“They are cultivating,” Murong Feng coughed lightly.

“Huh?”

Murong Xiao looked at his parents in confusion. Not only had he never seen it, he had never even heard of such a cultivation pose.

But his mother nodded as well. Since both parents said so, Murong Xiao believed them.

“I wasn't full earlier, so I wanted to ask Brother Li to make some more food. His cooking is delicious.”

“And now?”

“I don't seem to be that hungry anymore.”

Murong Xiao looked at his loving parents and the two cultivating not far away, rubbing his shiny bald head.

Suddenly.

A faint fluctuation spread.

“A breakthrough? Are they really dual-cultivating?” Murong Feng was stunned.

“Wu... Li Mo, this little guy, has reached the fourth orifice of the Divine Sea?” Wu Qing’s eyes widened.

Murong Xiao: “?”

So it wasn't just that?

A childhood without being fooled by one's parents is incomplete. At this moment, Murong Xiao’s childhood felt much more complete.

Congratulations.

The next moment.

The light of the Jade Phoenix God shone brilliantly. Li Mo decided to seize the momentum of breaking through to the fourth orifice of the Divine Sea and continue perfecting the Seventy-Two Transformations.

Meanwhile, Ying Bing needed to gather the divine will of a hundred birds to condense the Phoenix God, which also meant accepting the many true spirits within the Jade Phoenix God.

The divine light shone brightly, and many true spirits manifested, displaying a myriad of phenomena that illuminated the Water Clan’s Small World.

“Dad, Mom, you guys...”

“Son, don't speak. Observe the Divine Sea.”

Murong Feng pressed his son down, making him sit cross-legged.

Wu Qing went to notify the other Water Clansmen, telling them to hurry over and use the true spirits of the Jade Phoenix to enhance their own bloodline power.
