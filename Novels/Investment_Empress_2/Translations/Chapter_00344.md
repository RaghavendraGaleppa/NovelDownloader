Chapter 344: The Righteous Moniker "Little Brat" and the First Stop of Divine Prestige!

News that people love to hear spreads by word of mouth, the most primitive and efficient form of communication. The latest edition of the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon Rankings) spread rapidly through the streets and alleys.

Inside the Qingmu Camp.

"Our grain and pay are abundant this year; the soldiers can have a good New Year," remarked one officer.

Qu Sheng and a group of generals were tallying the military supplies in the warehouse, discussing the distribution of rewards and the pensions for the fallen soldiers.

Just as they were talking, a messenger ran in from outside.

"The Hidden Dragon Rankings have just been released! Young Master Li and Fairy Han have both made the top five!"

The central command tent fell silent for a moment.

Wu Lang, showing his gap-toothed grin, hurriedly asked, "What are their ranks?"

"Fairy Han is fifth, Young Master Li is fourth! He’s even earned the nickname 'Little Tyrant with the Divine Hammer'! His name is shaking the world!" the messenger emphasized.

"He didn't make the top three," Wu Lang said with a look of regret, feeling that the Heavenly Calculation Sect lacked authority and had underestimated Li Mo and Ying Bing.

A nearby garrison commander laughed and said, "Old Wu, the top five of the Hidden Dragon Rankings are all heaven's favorites, future immortals who will shake the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths with a single stomp. Don't think they're ordinary just because Young Master Li made dumplings with us."

The王爷 (Prince) was once ranked fourth on the Hidden Dragon Rankings in his youth. Thinking of it that way, it felt somewhat unreal that such a figure, without any airs, would squat on the ground making dumplings and grilling skewers with them.

"I don't mean that. I just think anyone on the Hidden Dragon Rankings couldn't possibly hold a thousand enemies alone if placed in Qingmu City," Wu Lang shook his head.

"With lofty ambitions in youth, there will come a time to be the first under heaven," Qu Sheng snapped out of his thoughts, took out a fresh sheet of paper, and began to write. "They are still young. On the Hidden Dragon Rankings, isn't everyone else three or five years older than them, or even more?"

The generals nodded in agreement, their faces filled with longing.

Perhaps in the near future, Young Master Li or Fairy Ying would occupy the first or second spot on the rankings?

What was even more terrifying was that the two of them seemed to be a pair?

This might set a precedent never seen since ancient times.

"This report will be sent to the Imperial Capital," Qu Sheng said, blowing on the ink to dry it.

"What do you intend to do?"

"The great victory at Qingmu must be reported so that the meritorious servants can receive their rewards."

........

Jiawei Restaurant.

"I just came back from viewing the rankings at the city gate. Guess what I saw?"

"Don't keep us in suspense. What is Young Master Li's rank?"

"What Young Master Li? It's the Little Tyrant with the Divine Hammer!"

"The fourth on the Hidden Dragon Rankings actually lives here?"

"He seems to have left already this morning."

"Then I'm off too. I need to go brag about this at my next meal."

"You aren't even eating the barbecue? This is made with the sauce from the barbecue master!"

"Waiter, to go!"

The news caused a widespread discussion among all sectors of Qingmu City. Business at Jiawei Restaurant was booming today.

The owner promoted their barbecue sauce, claiming it was personally taught by Young Master Li, an exclusive secret recipe. In the battle to defend Qingmu City, it knocked out tens of thousands of enemy troops and was a crucial part of the famous "Barbecue Strategy"!

The line of people stretched from the street corner to the end of the street.

On the second floor.

Fairy Han, dressed in a dark black flowing dress, tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and stared in the direction someone had left, lost in thought.

For the first time on the Hidden Dragon Rankings, he had surpassed her.

Although the system's ranking last time had her at the top, that was when Li Mo was injured and hadn't truly participated.

The ice lump felt a mix of emotions. She was naturally happy that he was becoming more and more astonishing.

But on the other hand, in her past life, once she ascended to the top of the Hidden Dragon Rankings, the number one spot never changed hands again until she entered the Inner Scenery and climbed the Human Rankings.

Ying Bing picked up the big-headed doll at her waist.

Her gaze was deep as she poked the big-headed doll's forehead.

---

In the future, would there be a day when he would shield her from the wind and rain?

No one had ever shielded her from the wind and rain, nor had anyone been qualified to be her reliance...

If that were truly the case, how could she righteously call him "Little Brat"?

As this thought surfaced in her mind, Ying Bing felt she was no longer herself.

"That extra Divine Form of his cannot be perfected just by observation."

"My progress in the Divine Observation Realm should be faster..."

Ying Bing let go of the big-headed doll, her expression turning focused.

She had felt it during their dual cultivation.

Both of them possessed a portion of the Great Yin Divine Intent, and simultaneously, the Divine Intent of another Divine Form. Hers was the Hundred Birds凰神 (Phoenix God), while Li Mo's was the Golden Armored figure that manifested on the battlefield that day, fighting against the heavens.

That Divine Form seemed to only be perfected through constant battle.

.......

At the same time, on the other side.

A white cloud left Qingmu City, heading south towards the southern border, a place rarely visited even by the demon race, mostly influenced by disaster beasts, and particularly advocating the customs of the Witch Spirits.

The Somersault Cloud could carry people, but it couldn't take others along for a journey of ten thousand miles.

Li Mo sat on the cloud, looking as high and cold as an ice lump, extremely serious.

Wu Qing, Guo Chuan, Ling Yuangou, and a group of martial artists skilled in mimetic martial arts sat with solemn expressions, as if they were about to execute a major mission.

Shang Qinqin crossed her hands, covering her mouth, her clothes and skirt fluttering in the wind.

Li Mo sat cross-legged and said, "Everyone, the 'Deity' is a serious role, and this play is also a serious play."

"You are all respected figures in the southern border. No matter what happens later, you must not laugh..."

"Pfft..."

Ling Yuangou couldn't hold it in. He desperately suppressed the corners of his mouth, holding back tears. "Yeah, Boss Mo, this cloud of yours... it's really white, haha... cough, cough!"

"..."

Li Mo fell silent for a moment, scanning the crowd. He finally sighed.

"Forget it. Laugh if you want to. It's better than holding it in when the plan starts..."

As soon as he finished speaking.

"Baa~ Hahahaha, Divine Hammer~ Little Tyrant~~~ Hahahaha!"

"Kukuku..."

"Hahaha, then I... I can't hold it either."

Shang Qinqin took her hand away from her mouth, patting the cloud and rolling around.

"You've been laughing, you never stopped!"

"Senior Guo, if you want to laugh, just laugh. Don't stomp your feet, or you'll shake my cloud apart and we'll all crash."

The scene became very chaotic for a moment.

Listening to the unbridled laughter, Li Mo's face was covered in black lines, trembling with anger.

He wanted to clear his name and spoke up, "Actually, I am a swordsman..."

"Hahahahaha!"

The laughter became even more cheerful.

Even the Red Cloud Sword was trembling, seemingly protesting against him.

Li Mo, the Little Tyrant with the Divine Hammer, remained expressionless, his back teeth grinding with a creaking sound.

Damn it!

Heavenly Calculation Sect!

You guys release the Hidden Dragon Rankings, a fair, just, and open authoritative list. You need to be responsible, have a conscience, and most importantly, be reasonable!

He spent so much martial arts insight, achieved such proud results in the Hengyun Sword City, and even collected straight sticks whenever he saw them...

Can't he be called a Sword Hero?!

To slander him like this, does the Heavenly Calculation Sect have no conscience?

Li Mo decided that one day, he would take his beautiful Master and pay them a visit to have a good talk.

Not long after.

On the distant horizon, several large mountains appeared, along with a village in the mountains.

The first stop of his divine prestige had arrived.

Three Mountain Town.
