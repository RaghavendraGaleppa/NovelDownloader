# Chapter 46: A Bountiful Harvest

Huang Jingjun was utterly despairing. Even his elder brother had been defeated, losing an arm. Who could save him now? The young hunter in his eyes, clutching a blood-stained long blade, was still the same person, but his image had completely transformed. Earlier, he had even tried to force the other party to collect herbs in the Heavenly Glow, finding him naive and ridiculous, asking his brother questions even when death loomed. Looking back now, at that time, a faint sneer had hung on his lips, while his brother had chuckled. But wasn't the other party looking at *them* in the same way?

The Tri-Color Flower was about to mature. Light mist flowed, and the refreshing floral fragrance grew increasingly rich, clearing one's mind and invigorating the spirit upon smelling it. Qin Ming was deeply captivated. He turned to dig for the jade box beneath the pile of scattered rocks, fearing he might miss the optimal harvesting period. Who knew if such a spiritual flower would rapidly wilt after fully blooming?

Huang Jingde clutched his severed arm with his left hand. The right side of his body was covered in blood, his armor drenched. As he staggered backward, he left bloody footprints on the ground. Seeing Qin Ming turn, he didn't contemplate a sneak attack. Instead, he took a deep look at his younger brother and prepared to flee. If he could live, even as a cripple, it would be enough.

Although Qin Ming was eager to pluck the Tri-Color Flower, he wouldn't make such a low-level mistake. How could he allow a master who had undergone three rebirths to escape right under his nose? Without even turning his head, the long-handled dark gold hammer in his left hand flew out. How formidable was his strength? Thrown with full force, it could even dent a city wall. Huang Jingde shrieked. The moment he turned, he heard a crisp *crack*, the sound of bone fracturing. In excruciating pain, he felt his spine shatter. Unable to support himself any longer, he felt the world spin, and with a *thud*, he collapsed onto the ground.

After retrieving the jade box, Qin Ming quickly moved forward, because the Tri-Color Flower was fully blooming at a visible speed, exceptionally radiant and beautiful. Nothing was more important than this. Qin Ming entered the Heavenly Glow, where ethereal colorful mists flowed, and went straight to the spiritual plant emanating a rich fragrance. It grew beside a fissure amidst the scattered rocks, only about a foot tall. The flower itself was not small; when its numerous petals unfurled, it was as large as a fist. Heavenly Glow burst forth from the fissure, causing Qin Ming some chest tightness and discomfort. The entire spiritual flower, accompanied by a rain of light, was exquisitely crystalline and fully bloomed. Within the Heavenly Glow, the flower's main body was silver, with faint, rosy cloud-like patterns, while its edges were blue and translucent. Its petals resembled willow leaves, but were sharper, even having angular edges. There were many layers of petals, forming a structure like a small forest of blades and swords; beautiful, yet exuding an aura of keenness.

"Perfectly ripe!"

Qin Ming moved, pushing aside the scattered rocks and digging out the entire Tri-Color Flower with his bare hands. From its leaves to its roots, it was also tri-colored, brimming with potent vitality. With a *snap*, Qin Ming closed the jade box and let out a long breath, having successfully harvested the incredibly precious spiritual flower.

"What a double blessing today!" Qin Ming was overjoyed, filled with a sense of accomplishment. After exacting revenge by killing the Golden Rooster Ridge people, he had unexpectedly obtained both blue jade-iron and this spiritual flower. Beside him, Huang Jingjun was so enraged that he coughed up blood repeatedly. Weren't those the very words *they* had spoken earlier? Now, he was at the end of his rope, clearly not long for this world.

"Thank you both for your gifts. I've been busy in the mountains for days, and haven't gained as much as I have now." Qin Ming's gratitude was heartfelt.

Huang Jingde was also infuriated beyond endurance, his suppressed rage threatening to burst from his chest. He had envisioned a brilliant future, about to use the spiritual flower to cultivate the Heavenly Glow energy, but now, everything was gone!

Regardless of whether they were nearing their last breath, Qin Ming still walked over and finished them off one by one, cleanly sending them on their way. While searching their bodies, he unexpectedly found candles on Huang Jingde. After a moment's thought, he knew their purpose: they were for sealing the gaps of jade boxes. "Meticulous!" he praised. This way, even if some mutated creatures had keen senses of smell, they likely wouldn't detect anything.

Finally, Qin Ming carried the two Huang brothers and placed them together with the old man from Golden Rooster Ridge and the two Golden Rooster Knights. He reluctantly put down the long blade and silver spear. These weapons were simply too conspicuous; he couldn't possibly take them out and use them.

At this point, the underground had descended into chaos. Various mutated creatures had burst in. Qin Ming arrived in an area filled with loud roars, instantly attracting some fierce mutated beasts. Subsequently, the old man from Golden Rooster Ridge and the Huang brothers became "flesh and blood spiritual medicine" for the mutated creatures.

Above ground, fierce raptors circled. A silver giant eagle, with wings spanning ten meters, along with numerous other flying mutated creatures, monitored the entire great rift valley. In the underground world, even Cao Long, Mu Qing, and Wei Zhirou's expressions changed. They gathered with the elders of their clans.

"We've already seen creatures that have mutated four or even five times!"

"Let's stay underground. At least we're in the depths of the great rift valley, not near the exit, so our position is decent. The mutated creatures can't attack here for long. Once the news spreads, Scarlet Cloud City will surely send rescue."

In the underground caves, even Qin Ming was impacted. In this chaotic situation, it was no longer suitable to fish in troubled waters. It was too bloody; some mutated creatures were incredibly brutal, tearing people apart before eating them. While searching for a path, he had already killed several mutated creatures. He couldn't run deeper into the great rift valley. According to his memory, he moved towards the area where the mountain folk had disappeared. Qin Ming estimated that some old hunters might be able to find a path out of the valley, as they had frequented the mountains for years, possessing extensive survival experience and life-saving skills. This was evident from the correct decisions they made as soon as they entered the underground.

A large white bear with ferocious eyes, its mouth stained with blood, and two corpses impaled on its sharp claws, charged directly at Qin Ming upon seeing him. "I can't take down this giant bear!" Qin Ming sensed danger. This monstrous beast was far more formidable than creatures that had mutated three times. He quickly fled. He had experienced such perilous escapes even when he was young; living off the mountains since he was fourteen or fifteen, it truly was a matter of narrow escapes from death. However, back then, he faced ordinary beasts and had Lu Ze, Xu Yueping, and others looking out for him. Now, he encountered a multi-mutated giant beast.

Qin Ming hadn't faced such a bloody and terrifying scene in a long time. He could only keep fleeing; otherwise, stopping meant death. Fortunately, the underground passages were dense, like a spiderweb, and some areas were very narrow. The white giant bear was blocked. It angrily slammed the stone wall, causing the entire passage to tremble violently and rocks to roll down. The two corpses hanging from its large claws were already mangled beyond recognition.

Qin Ming knew that Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect would suffer heavy losses this time. The small number of survivors were already rushing towards the territory occupied by Huang Jingde's family. Many paths in the underground caves were stained with blood. The roars of mutated creatures and the shouts of humans constantly echoed. If the two sides truly met, one would inevitably fall.

Qin Ming walked along a narrow passage. After emerging into another area, he happened to see an elder from the Three-Eyed Sect die miserably, impaled through the chest by the thick, long horn of a golden giant bull. This elder, who had undergone three rebirths, was quite unfortunate. He was a terrible navigator, lacking a sense of direction, constantly wandering around and never leaving this area. Otherwise, with his strength, he would have long since escaped to the Huang family's territory. He was utterly disoriented here. The golden giant bull's two massive horns already bore five corpses. With a forceful toss of its enormous head, all the bodies were flung away, striking the stone walls with *thuds* and leaving behind pools of blood. And beneath its feet were more corpses, already trampled to pulp by its enormous hooves.

The golden giant bull's hide, smooth as silk, was almost completely stained red with blood. Upon seeing Qin Ming, it immediately snorted fire from its nostrils and charged forward. Seeing its ferocity, Qin Ming knew he was no match. He turned and re-entered the narrow passage. Taunting or cursing a terrifying mutated creature now would be useless. He could only hope that the beast would leave quickly. This feeling of life and death being beyond his control was very unsettling. Qin Ming intensely desired to grow stronger. In such a place, if a smaller, multi-mutated creature were to appear, he would surely die.

"*CRASH!*"

The golden giant bull's horns were even more terrifying than a gleaming long blade, shattering the stone walls, sending large rocks tumbling down, and raising clouds of dust. The fire it spat from its mouth incinerated the rock wall, turning it red and sending out waves of heat. "No wonder the elder who underwent three rebirths was no match for it and died miserably in the passage," Qin Ming thought, his heart pounding, as he retreated deeper into the passage.

After a full fifteen minutes, the golden giant bull finally left. It was unwilling to leave without killing the "two-legged creature" it had spotted. Qin Ming waited a moment longer. It was much quieter outside. He cautiously made his way out. This time, although he still encountered some mutated creatures, they weren't as dangerous.

Finally, he entered a narrow crevice that was barely passable for a person. After squeezing through, the path became somewhat easier. This was the last area the mountain folk had entered. Qin Ming walked haltingly, one step deep, one step shallow. It was utterly dark here. Fortunately, he carried a Sun Stone. Even so, he struggled through various rough and difficult paths for over half an hour before emerging from the dim underground fissure, escaping the great rift valley, and arriving in a dense forest.

Qin Ming had to admire those experienced old hunters. If it were up to him to find this escape route, he certainly wouldn't have found it so quickly. He felt a bit emotional. The mountain folk who were originally prospecting for minerals were in the most dangerous situation, yet in the end, they were the ones who escaped alive. Of course, this also had to do with them starting to save themselves as soon as they entered the underground. If they had been chased in by mutated creatures like the Golden Rooster Ridge and Three-Eyed Sect members, they wouldn't have had time to find a path.

Qin Ming let out a long breath. No matter what, he had finally escaped with his life. The mountains were very quiet. He saw hardly any creatures while traveling. Qin Ming slowed his pace. Many dangerous mutated creatures in the mountains had now rushed into the great rift valley. He pondered, then suddenly stopped.

"If I'm not mistaken, the lairs of that white bear and golden bull are less than ten *li* from here. They are among the most powerful creatures in the outer regions of the mountains."

Qin Ming acted decisively. He turned and sprinted wildly in a certain direction. When he encountered the two giant beasts, he was almost killed. Although he ultimately sustained no injuries, the process was incredibly perilous. Had he not found that narrow passage, he would either have been torn apart by the bear's claws or impaled on the bull's horns. Qin Ming decided to take advantage of the two giant beasts being away from home and raid their lairs.
