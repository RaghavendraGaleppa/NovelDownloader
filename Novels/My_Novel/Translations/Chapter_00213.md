# Chapter 213: Astonishing Archery and a Journey of Ten Thousand Miles

"Senior Old Dragon, we are here to help you."

Seven figures approached from the distance.

It turned out there was a feast not far away. Hearing the commotion, they had rushed over to assist.

Su Yu asked, "Who are you? Given this situation, do you have any good strategies?"

The Python Dragon had expended a great deal of energy and was now resting in the river to recover its strength. The river water was unusually calm, and the Dragon-Riding Ship remained steady, hovering in the middle of the river.

However, the rain had not stopped, and thunder continued to gather. Once the "Walking Water" began, it was a process of exhaustion, lightning strikes, and battles to the death—it was absolutely impossible to stop halfway.

The seven men exchanged a glance and announced loudly, "We are the Seven Masters of the Art of Intrigue."

Wen Caichang said, "The Seven Masters of the Art of Intrigue... Enforcers for the Zhang Family Fish Guild in South Chongqing, well-versed in water techniques. How do you plan to help? Let's hear it."

The leader of the seven said, "It is an honor that the Madam has heard of our reputation. We seven brothers are not talented, but we know some wave-dancing techniques. We can help Senior Old Dragon build up the waves!"

The Python Dragon raised its head and said, "Good! You shall dance the waves for me and build momentum!"

The Seven Masters took their positions on the shore, arranging themselves in a peculiar formation known as the "Seven Stars Formation of Intrigue." Individually, the strength of the Seven Masters was average.

However, when they joined forces in this formation, they had once captured a third-realm martial artist. The secret to their success lay in the Seven Stars Formation of Intrigue.

Though the seven men had no blood relation, their bond was deep. They had met by chance in the Jianghu and found they were kindred spirits. By a stroke of fate, they had obtained a legacy and practiced the long-lost martial arts of the "School of Intrigue."

Having trained until their minds were connected, the Seven Stars Formation of Intrigue contained the principles of the Art of Intrigue and the changes of the stars. As the seven men stood in their respective positions, their internal energy was mysteriously linked. Suddenly, one man pushed his palms forward, and his Qi flowed into the river, pushing up a wave. Another man "received" the wave and pushed it to the next person.

In this way, they pushed and surged the waves, piling them up to greater heights. The river waves grew larger and larger, rolling and galloping with powerful Qi. At this point, the Seven Masters were already sweating profusely from the effort of controlling the waves together.

Just as their internal energy was about to be depleted, the seven men combined their strength and pushed the massive wave toward the waterfall, shouting, "Senior Old Dragon, now!"

The Python Dragon rode the wave and was effortlessly carried hundreds of zhang high. It then used the momentum to leap forward, flying nearly five hundred zhang this time, its momentum like a dragon. It generated a powerful airflow that enveloped the Dragon-Riding Ship and carried it upward.

After several attempts, the Python Dragon finally crossed the waterfall. At that moment... the rain grew heavier and the thunder more密集. Yet, a faint golden hue began to shimmer between its scales.

It was the first transformation from a Python Dragon to a true Dragon.

The Dragon-Riding Ship, enveloped by the giant wave and carried by the airflow from the Python Dragon's ascent, also crossed the waterfall.

The Seven Masters of the Art of Intrigue watched them leave. Seeing the fierce momentum of the dragon, they felt a bit relieved.

Along the way, six thousand miles, seven thousand miles, eight thousand miles... The momentum was unstoppable, with no obstacles in its path.

Between the Python Dragon's dark green scales, the golden color deepened.

The third day of the second month.

It traveled ten thousand miles a day. A day and a night passed.

It arrived at a gentle terrain where the river channel was straight and the river surface was wide. The Python Dragon frolicked in the water, feeling immensely joyful.

Dawn broke, offering a moment of peace.

It turned into a bend.

Suddenly, more than ten boats shot out from the riverbank. On each boat were dozens of people, holding sabers, spears, staffs, iron nets, silver hooks, and various other weapons.

There were about a hundred people in total.

They cast iron nets, intending to capture and kill the dragon in the river. Nearly a hundred men with excellent swimming skills and considerable power dared to jump into the water to fight the dragon.

The leader was named "Single Light Saber," a master of the Single Family Boat Guild with formidable saber skills.

The Python Dragon flew into a rage and whipped its tail, slapping the waves. With a casual flick, dozens of people were killed or injured. Though ants are small, their numbers are overwhelming. Some lucky ones managed to swing their sabers and cut the dragon's body, drawing blood.

"Kill!"

Suddenly, from another direction, several large ships arrived. The fierce soldiers on board were extremely brave, jumping into the river to fight the men of Single Light Saber.

The two sides became locked in a stalemate.

Single Light Saber waved a flag, commanding his men in the water to form a killing formation. They were well-organized, as if they had practiced this countless times. Their entanglement severely hindered the progress of the "Walking Water."

Li Xian understood: "This must be the battle between those who wish to admire the dragon and those who wish to slay it. The Python Dragon has journeyed ten thousand miles, and its serpent body is transforming, but the true danger is only just beginning. Unfortunately, my strength is insufficient, and I can only be a spectator. However... for such a grand event, even as a spectator, I am content!"

Zhu Butong, observing from the ship, caught a glimpse of Li Xian out of the corner of his eye and suddenly thought: "This小子 has been on the boat for a day. He is neither a master nor of any use. He wanders around, truly an eyesore. We are fighting hard to protect the dragon, and in the end... this小子 will reap the benefits!"

Feeling indignant, and seeing the fierce battle in the water, he walked over with a smile and said, "Brother Li, what do you think of the battle in the water? Isn't it magnificent? Isn't it exhilarating?"

Li Xian replied truthfully, "Fighting and battling are full of danger and ferocity. I do not find it magnificent or exhilarating."

"A fine young man like you, how can you be afraid of such things," Zhu Butong said. "I say, at your age, you should experience such trials. Why not jump into the river, get some blood on you, and contribute a little? That way, sitting on this boat, you'll feel more at ease."

Li Xian understood the subtext: he was implying that Li Xian was not qualified to be on the boat. He said, "Why doesn't Senior Zhu go down?"

"You go down first, then I'll go down," Zhu Butong said, subtly applying pressure.

Wen Caichang walked over gracefully, her gaze sweeping over them calmly.

Zhu Butong took a half-step back and said, "Madam Wen, I have no ill intentions. But your young man here has a tender face and white teeth. Riding on your coattails as the Sword-Sheathing Madam, he sits here and reaps all the benefits. I am truly envious of his good fortune. However, for us martial artists, to sit and enjoy the fruits of others' labor is not right. We should have him contribute a little, so his presence is justified."

Wen Caichang said, "You look down on him?"

Zhu Butong laughed, "Does this Golden Saber Earth Dragon need to look up to a junior?" He was arrogant by nature. After a day on the boat, he had come to respect all the other masters on board.

Only Li Xian was very weak, yet he had a close relationship with the Sword-Sheathing Madam and was able to ride in the same boat. The more Zhu Butong looked at him, the more annoyed he became. However, he did not want to offend Wen Caichang and dared not speak ill of her.

Therefore, he intentionally provoked him.

"If I said... his use is greater than yours?" Wen Caichang smiled.

"Preposterous," Zhu Butong said, angry but not showing it. He thought, "Wen Caichang, Wen Caichang, you are too arrogant. To compare me, Zhu Butong, to this小子."

He snorted coldly and turned away, but he did not dare to do anything.

Wen Caichang said with a smile, "Wait a moment."

"What is it?" Zhu Butong asked irritably.

Wen Caichang said, "I was not joking. If you don't believe me, why not compete with Li Xian?"

"If I just stand here, and your young man dares to take half a step closer, he wins," Zhu Butong said, clasping his hands behind his back and staring at Li Xian. He had practiced the formidable "Python Frenzy Qi-Capturing Art," which had no fist or kick techniques but focused on condensing one's aura.

By glaring at an opponent, he could strike fear into their heart and obstruct their Qi flow. Zhu Butong had observed the "Walking Water" and found this martial art very beneficial. He now naturally unleashed it, aiming it at Li Xian.

Li Xian snorted coldly and stepped forward, saying, "Senior Zhu, what should I do?" Although he felt his pores stand on end and a chill run through his body, Li Xian had been through many life-and-death situations since he began practicing martial arts, forging a resilient martial heart.

Such a Qi-capturing art, no matter how powerful, was useless against him.

"You..." Zhu Butong was stunned.

Wen Caichang looked at him with approval and said softly, "I imagine Senior Zhu is not convinced by this defeat. This round doesn't count; we should have another competition."

"What do you propose we compare now?" Zhu Butong grumbled.

Wen Caichang walked to the edge of the ship and pointed at the river, saying, "It's simple. Whoever makes Single Light Saber fall into the water first wins."

"Seriously?" Zhu Butong asked suspiciously, thinking, "Your young man is only at the Food Essence Realm. He probably can't even take a single slash from Single Light Saber, how could he possibly make him fall into the water?" Naturally, he did not dare to say this out loud.

"Of course," Wen Caichang said.

"Good!" Zhu Butong shouted and flew off. His golden saber left its sheath, its light shimmering, with the roar of dragons and tigers.

Wen Caichang said, "Shoot his left leg." Li Xian, who had a long bow on his back, took an arrow and shot it at Single Light Saber's left leg.

Single Light Saber was startled. He waved his saber to block, deflecting the arrow. He looked toward the Dragon-Riding Ship and frowned. Wen Caichang said, "I say shoot there, you shoot there."

"Shoot seven arrows in a row, aiming for his Lingtai, Xuangji... and other acupoints."

As Wen Caichang's words fell, Li Xian shot an arrow. There was no pause, their coordination was perfect.

"Shoot four arrows in a row, aiming for his neck, eyes, torso, and back."

The four arrows were released almost simultaneously, incredibly precise and powerful.

"Good. Use three-tenths of your strength to shoot his index finger, four-tenths for his right shoulder. Finally, use all your strength for one arrow, but shoot into empty space."

Li Xian's control of his strength was exquisite. The last arrow shot into the void, and in a marvelous turn of events, Single Light Saber let out a splash and fell into the river, his face full of horror.

He cried out in terror, "What a terrifying sword art, what a terrifying archery!"

He used archery to execute sword techniques. Single Light Saber felt as if he were dueling with a swordsman, being pushed back step by step, his weaknesses, flaws, and loopholes all seen through. When he finally made a desperate counterattack, he lunged at nothing but air.

Naturally, he splashed into the water.

Golden Saber Earth Dragon Zhu Butong had not even arrived when he saw the outcome was already decided. But when he looked back, he no longer dared to look down on Li Xian.

He saw Madam Wen standing gracefully behind Li Xian. She suddenly smiled and whispered a few words in Li Xian's ear. Li Xian turned his arrow and shot it at Zhu Butong.

Zhu Butong deflected the flying arrow and knew it was extraordinary. The archery was skillful, but the force was not strong. The more terrifying aspect was that the arrow targeted the flaws in his martial art, breaking the whole with a single point. If this were a real fight, Wen Caichang could defeat him with a single arrow.

He also splashed into the river, utterly embarrassed. The other masters on the ship—Su Yu, Qi Kaiyan, and others—all gasped in astonishment.

Their thoughts were similar. They all felt Li Xian had gained a huge advantage. After this incident, they all thought: "The Sword-Sheathing Madam's young man, at such a young age, how did he forge such archery skills? He shoots wherever she points, without the slightest hesitation, his control of force is incredibly precise, and his arrows contain intent... With such archery skills in the hands of the Sword-Sheathing Madam, it is like adding wings to a tiger!"

"The Sword-Sheathing Madam's sword art is also terrifying. By revealing just a fraction of it, she made Single Light Saber lose his wings and Zhu Butong fall into the water."

Wen Caichang had a faint smile, and she had established her authority without showing any overt signs.

Zhu Butong leaped out of the water, grabbed the ship's edge, and climbed onto the deck. He held back his frustration, not daring to let it show.

The battle in the river continued.

Inside the Dragon-Riding Ship, Wen Caichang said, "The dragon's 'Walking Water' directly affects the future business of the Benhua River."

"The most heavily involved are the fish guilds and boat guilds... These businesses rely on the river. They are most afraid of losing face. One side wants to admire the dragon and help it on its journey. The other side wants to slay the dragon and kill it."

"Xiao Xian, this Dragon-Riding Ship was built by the Hong Family Boat Guild. The Hong Muchai I introduced to you earlier is a master from the Hong Family Boat Guild. The ones who have come to capture the dragon now, the one you shot into the water, is Single Light Saber from the Single Family Boat Guild."

"The dragon's 'Walking Water' involves conflicts of interest. The struggle for elixirs and treasures, the struggle for industries... There will be more to come. Just watch slowly."

Wen Caichang casually imparted knowledge of the Jianghu.

Li Xian muttered to himself, "Jianghu relationships are complex, with tangled interests. Once you are in the Jianghu, it's hard to avoid."

The further the dragon's "Walking Water" progressed, the more exhausted the dragon became. Therefore, in the ten thousand miles ahead, although those hosting the "Slaying the Dragon Banquet" set up obstacles, they rarely confronted it head-on.

After ten thousand miles, the dragon gradually grew fatigued. The guests of the Slaying the Dragon Banquet, however, were sharpening their blades, all taking their positions, and their attacks were becoming increasingly fierce
