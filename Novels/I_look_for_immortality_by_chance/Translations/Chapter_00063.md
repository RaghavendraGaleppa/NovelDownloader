# Chapter 63: The Twin-Pupiled Giant Ape  

"Roar! Roar!"  

A dozen spirit apes gathered together, launching a coordinated attack against Gu Yuan. What should have been an overwhelming numerical advantage was instantly shattered by the Mistwalking Cloud Seal.  

A vast, dense fog blotted out the sky, suppressing the apes' spiritual senses and physical perceptions. Though their kin stood right beside them, all they could see was the thick mist—not a single ape was visible, and even the roars from their own mouths were inaudible. Panic began to spread among the apes.  

"Boom!"  

At that moment, lightning flashed above the mist. A golden-backed ape, unable to resist, was instantly struck unconscious by the surging thunder and collapsed into the fog.  

"Roar!"  

The lead golden-backed ape sensed intense danger. The golden fur on its back shimmered like flowing liquid as its body suddenly swelled in size, its strength surging. It let out a deafening roar toward the mist.  

The sound waves shook the heavens, rippling outward and dispersing a small portion of the fog. But that was all it could do.  

"Whoosh!"  

The Threefold Decay Mirror rose into the air, casting a silver light onto the silver-backed ape. The creature's enlarged body shrank back, its strength waning, and its demonic power suppressed.  

Then, a storm of yellow sand swept in. Countless grains of malevolent sand eroded its flesh, leaving it drenched in blood and writhing in agony within moments.  

"Swish! Swish!"  

The other silver-backed apes fared even worse. Lost in the mist without even catching a glimpse of Gu Yuan, they were swiftly incapacitated by scorching fire serpents and icy chains.  

In just a few breaths, the mist dissipated.  

Inside the cavern, Gu Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, his sleeves fluttering gracefully. At his feet lay a group of unconscious apes—none dead, merely injured and unconscious.  

Yet Gu Yuan did not immediately take the spirit stones and leave. Instead, he raised his head and gazed at the roaring waterfall before him.  

After breaking through to the seventh level of Qi Refinement, Gu Yuan's spiritual sense had grown significantly. Earlier, during negotiations with the golden-backed ape, he had noticed its ears twitching constantly—clearly receiving instructions from somewhere.  

This meant that within the golden-backed ape clan, there was an even more formidable presence nearby.  

Gu Yuan didn’t know what this being intended, but he was certain it would reveal itself. Only by resolving this final threat could he safely claim his reward.  

"Boom!"  

At that moment, a massive figure leaped out from behind the waterfall and landed before Gu Yuan.  

A ferocious aura instantly filled the entire cave. Gu Yuan frowned, his eyes narrowing with vigilance.  

The creature was a towering ape, similar in size to the other golden-backed apes, but its golden fur was far more luxuriant, spreading across its back like a crescent moon.  

Moreover, its eyes glowed faintly with golden light—most strikingly, they were naturally twin-pupiled!  

Ninth-level Qi Refinement!  

This golden-backed ape was at least at the ninth level of Qi Refinement!  

Even more concerning, the ape carried a frail, white-haired elder on its back. The elder was clearly of the same lineage, its golden fur half-turned white with age. Yet its eyes remained sharp, and its gaze upon Gu Yuan was gentle, devoid of hostility.  

"Roar!"  

The twin-pupiled golden ape, however, was furious. Seeing its fallen kin, its eyes flashed with murderous intent.  

"Whoosh!"  

With a single leap, it crossed several zhang in an instant, its fist smashing toward Gu Yuan with terrifying force.  

The demonic power behind the strike seemed to tear through the air, the sheer pressure making Gu Yuan's scalp tingle. This punch carried at least two hundred thousand jin of force.  

"Mistwalking Cloud Seal!"  

Gu Yuan exhaled sharply, summoning a dense fog to obscure the ape's vision.  

But the golden ape's twin pupils shimmered with an eerie light, piercing through the mist as if it could see Gu Yuan's exact location. Its golden fist never faltered, driving straight for his face.  

"Mountain Seal!"  
"Lotus Barrier!"  

Gu Yuan reacted swiftly, activating two defensive artifacts in an instant.  

"Purple Lightning Chisel!"  
"Threefold Decay Mirror!"  

Simultaneously, two top-grade artifacts above his head surged with radiant spiritual light, attacking the golden ape.  

"Roar!"  

The ape's strength was suppressed by the Threefold Decay Mirror, its vitality seemingly diminished. The Purple Lightning Chisel's electricity struck next, blasting into the ape's body with violent force.  

Yet the golden ape's body shimmered with a strange radiance, as if clad in golden armor. It withstood the lightning and continued its assault unabated.  

"Clang!"  

Under the combined might of the two top-grade artifacts, the ape's momentum finally slowed. Though its punch sent ripples through the Mountain Seal's illusory barrier, it failed to break through.  

"Roar!"  

The golden ape paused, glaring at the four radiant artifacts above Gu Yuan's head with frustration.  

Top-grade artifacts were the trump cards of Qi Refinement cultivators—capable of bridging gaps in cultivation. To possess even one was remarkable, let alone four.  

"Roar!"  

The golden ape pointed angrily at Gu Yuan, then spread its empty hands in challenge, as if demanding a fair fight without artifacts.  

Gu Yuan remained unmoved. The golden ape's aura was undeniably fierce, likely at the ninth level of Qi Refinement. Without his artifacts, he stood no chance.  

To discard them would be foolish.  

Moreover, the white-haired elder on the ape's back radiated an even more oppressive presence.  

"Buzz!"  

Instead of withdrawing his artifacts, Gu Yuan summoned the Minor Titan Seal and the Secret Origin Piercing Arrow, channeling power into them.  

At the same time, he prepared to activate the Frost Rhinoceros Dragon Star Spirit, ready to transform at any moment.  

"Roar!"  

Seeing the glowing runes gathering in Gu Yuan's palm—like boiling magma—the golden ape's expression turned grave. The Secret Origin Piercing Arrow, enhanced by the Minor Titan Seal, was a devastating weapon. If fully charged, its power would be earth-shattering.  

"Ook! Ook!"  

The golden ape looked up at the elder on its back, its cries urgent and almost pleading.  

After a moment's hesitation, the elder nodded.  

"Ook! Ook!"  

The golden ape roared in triumph, turning back to Gu Yuan with renewed battle lust.  

"Ooooh!"  

"Boom! Boom!"  

The ape pounded its chest violently, golden-red liquid seeping from its fur. It howled at the sky like a wolf, its body expanding with each strike until it stood several zhang tall—a colossal golden beast with twin pupils blazing like twin suns.  

"Whoosh!"  

The white-haired elder reached into its abdomen and pulled out a slender golden rod, tossing it to the golden ape.  

"Ook! Ook!"  

The rod expanded with the wind, growing to over ten feet in length as the giant ape grasped it.  

With the golden staff in hand, the ape's confidence soared. No longer frustrated by Gu Yuan's artifacts, it now burned with pure battle fervor.  

"Boom!"  

It swung the staff with overwhelming force—like a mountain descending from the heavens. This single strike carried at least three hundred and fifty thousand jin of power.
