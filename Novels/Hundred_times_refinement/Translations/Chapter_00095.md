# Chapter 45: Fierce Battle

No matter what, blood ran thicker than water. Yan Tianheng pulled his son behind him with one hand while raising the other in front of his chest, forming a series of hand seals. A pale yellow spiritual energy emanated from his body, coalescing into a shield-like barrier.

*Thud!*

The fireball collided with the spiritual energy shield, hissing and crackling. Yet moments later, it dissipated like mud sinking into the sea—completely ineffective. The Fireball Talisman was merely a low-level spell, far too weak to breach the defenses of the Yan Family's patriarch.

Seeing his attack fail, Lin Xuan's expression grew even graver. He didn't rush to attack again—hastily striking now would be pointless.

*Before learning to strike, one must first learn to endure.*  

Battles between cultivators were perilous; a single misstep could cost one's life. Thus, defense came first. Since his ambush had failed, Lin Xuan now had to prepare for a prolonged fight.  

Unlike the useless Yan Ming, Lin Xuan remained calm and analytical even when facing a formidable opponent. Without hesitation, he channeled his spiritual energy, forming a protective barrier around himself. Then, he pulled out two talismans from his robes. A trace of reluctance flickered in his eyes, but his gaze quickly hardened as he tossed both talismans into the air.  

The first talisman erupted in golden light, transforming into a massive golden coin that hovered above Lin Xuan. With a gesture, the coin descended to shield him.  

"**Golden Bell Technique!**"  

Yan Tianheng's expression darkened. This was a mid-tier metal-attribute defensive spell—exceptionally sturdy. How could a rogue cultivator possess such a valuable talisman?  

But his shock had only just begun. The second talisman activated, forming a massive, translucent blue bubble that enveloped Lin Xuan.  

"**Water Spirit Talisman!**"  

Another mid-tier defensive spell!  

Yan Tianheng had initially been skeptical when his son claimed a rogue cultivator was trading mid-grade pills for techniques—despite numerous witnesses. But now, he believed it. This was no ordinary rogue cultivator. With years of experience in judging people, he could tell the boy’s disguise was merely a facade.  

"**Who are you, really?**" Yan Tianheng growled, his face darkening with each word.  

Lin Xuan remained silent. At this point, their conflict had escalated to a life-or-death struggle—words were meaningless, and only a fool would reveal his identity.  

Using two mid-tier defensive talismans in one go pained him. Defensive talismans were far rarer and more valuable than offensive ones. Even with the wealth inherited from Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan, he had only possessed these two. Now, they were gone in an instant.  

---  

Lin Xuan ignored the question and instead channeled his spiritual energy, conjuring several ice bullets that shot toward his opponent.  

"**Hmph, petty tricks!**"  

A sinister smirk curled on Yan Tianheng’s lips. As a cultivator at the peak of the Spirit Movement stage, he couldn’t care less about low-tier spells like Ice Bullet Technique.  

With one hand extended, he pressed his thumb and forefinger together, chanting under his breath. His spiritual energy surged, and in an instant, a massive flame erupted from his palm, morphing into the shape of a fiery bird.  

As for the ice bullets? He didn’t even bother glancing at them—they wouldn’t even scratch his spiritual shield.  

"**Firebird Technique!**"  

A mid-tier fire-attribute spell. Truly befitting a cultivator on the verge of Foundation Establishment—his first move was already extraordinary.  

Yet Lin Xuan remained unshaken. With a swift motion, he retrieved five more talismans from his robes.  

*"Ice Seal Technique!"*  

Water countered fire. Though this was also a low-tier spell, with five talismans against one, they could hold their own against the Firebird Technique.  

Yan Tianheng’s eyes widened in shock and fury. This was beyond unexpected. *Who the hell is this kid? How does he have so many talismans?*  

Rogue cultivators were already ruled out—even elite sect disciples couldn’t be this wealthy!  

No matter what, this boy couldn’t be allowed to leave alive.  

With that thought, Yan Tianheng unleashed a relentless barrage of mid-tier spells, bombarding Lin Xuan without pause.  

Lin Xuan’s expression remained indifferent, but inwardly, he was stunned. *This is the power of a seventh-layer cultivator.* At this moment, he realized just how lucky he had been to kill Zhou Yan with a trap.  

If Zhou Yan hadn’t underestimated him—neglecting even to activate a basic shield—he would have died in that valley long ago.  

But the Yan Family patriarch was fighting at full strength, leaving no room for tricks. Of course, Lin Xuan was no longer the weak first-layer disciple he had once been.  

He reached for more talismans. There was a reason he relied on them rather than his own spiritual energy.  

First, despite his rapid progress, the time he had spent cultivating was still short. His cultivation was three whole layers below his opponent’s, meaning his spiritual energy was vastly inferior. In a direct clash of spells, technique was secondary—what truly mattered was the depth of one’s spiritual power. Engaging in such a battle would be suicide.  

Second, Lin Xuan’s focus had shifted since obtaining a spirit artifact. Unlike ordinary disciples, he had mastered only a handful of spells.  

To defeat a stronger opponent, he had to play to his strengths. Compared to Yan Tianheng, his advantage was simple—*he had more talismans.*  

---  

They could be activated instantly and consumed minimal spiritual energy. Against a superior foe, there was no reason *not* to use them.  

As for the Ice Needle Technique and his spirit artifact? Those were his trump cards. Since this had turned into a battle of attrition, he couldn’t reveal them prematurely.  

After assessing the situation and formulating a strategy, Lin Xuan steadied his breathing and calmly engaged in a relentless exchange of talismans.  

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*  

The explosions were deafening. The battle between cultivators could only be described as ferocious.  

Yan Tianheng grew increasingly furious. Despite being at the peak of the Spirit Movement stage, mid-tier spells drained his spiritual energy at an alarming rate. Yet his opponent’s talismans seemed endless.  

If this continued…
