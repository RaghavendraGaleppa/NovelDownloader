Chapter 115: Combined Technique! The Blood Phoenix Secret Realm is About to Open

The anomaly faded, and the furnace went cold.

The peak was momentarily silent, save for the furnace lid clattering back to the ground, wobbling as it refused to fall over.

Three people...

Oh, wait. Two people and one pill. All three fell into deep thought.

"Master, I'm inside Junior Brother Li's stomach."

Tang Xiaobao's muffled voice came through.

He was inside Li Mo's stomach—more accurately, speaking from his Dantian.

"I don't feel uncomfortable. In fact..."

Li Mo's expression was indescribably strange.

Of course it's strange! Anyone would feel weird hearing a voice coming from their stomach!

And what confused him most was... was he practicing martial arts or cultivation?

In this world of cultivation, this would make him a Golden Core powerhouse at the very least.

Or even a Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't be an exaggeration.

"........"

Xue Jing wanted to say that Li Mo was fine, but as a powerful Inner Scene expert, his vision was currently going dark.

After a moment of silence.

The old man walked up to Li Mo in a daze, grabbing him by the neck and shaking him.

"Spit Xiaobao out, quick!"

"Wow! The Cauldron Peak has cultivated him for thousands of years, through the hard work of over a dozen generations, and you just ate him? Huh?"

The old man's mentality was on the verge of collapse.

Li Mo was shaken until he felt dizzy.

"Master, I'm fine," Tang Xiaobao quickly said.

He hesitated for a moment, then added, "Junior Brother Li's Dantian is surprisingly roomy."

"Eh? What is that?"

"We all need to calm down," Li Mo said, his mouth twitching uncontrollably.

Heaven and Earth bear witness, he only intended to use the furnace to refine the Golden Crow Blood and顺便 help Senior Brother Xiaobao to secure an investment.

The investment was a success.

The system had already sent a notification.

But who could have predicted that, under the牵引 of his internal energy, he would directly bring Senior Brother Xiaobao into his Dantian!

He took a quick internal look.

Sure enough, the golden Dragon-Tiger Pill was bouncing around on the two-leaved fiery lotus flower in his Dantian.

Xue Jing looked at him with a resentful expression, his grievance heavier than a ghost's.

Li Mo didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Let's figure out what exactly happened first."

"I suppose we have no other choice," Xue Jing replied, taking several deep breaths.

Thus, Li Mo detailed everything that had happened at the end of the furnace refining process.

Xue Jing's expression shifted from disbelief to a dazed stupor.

"My theory from back then... was actually correct? I just had the wrong method?!"

"Is it really possible to achieve the Xuan Dan through External Pill techniques?!"

Li Mo's expression grew even stranger.

He hadn't even reached the halfway point of the Jade Liquid Realm, yet he had instantly become a Xuan Dan cultivator.

"To be honest, I don't even know how a Xuan Dan is condensed."

"And what exactly was your theory back then?" Li Mo asked further.

"The so-called Xuan Dan is the condensation of a person's 'Qi' into a solid form."

"The accumulation of 'Qi' is too slow. Not everyone has a constant supply of rare treasures to consume."

"So at the time, I wondered if I could skip the process of gathering Qi with the human body, directly refine the 'Qi' from the outside world, use pill-refining techniques to turn it into a pill, and finally absorb it into the body."

Xue Jing said with a complex expression.

Although he later thought it was a pipe dream, today, that perfect vision from back then had actually manifested in Li Mo and Xiaobao.

The difference was probably that Li Mo had a special physique, and Xiaobao wasn't an ordinary pill—his true form was the Nine-Orifice Dragon-Tiger Pill.

Furthermore, one person and one pill had to be refined together in the furnace, operating their techniques simultaneously to create a resonance.

Well...

It was estimated that no one else would ever be able to complete this theory.

"How does it compare to a true Xuan Dan?" Li Mo asked curiously.

"It depends on the quality of the pill," Xue Jing replied with a complicated look.

"A Xuan Dan can be projected outside the body, right?" Li Mo mused, seeming to have found a solution. "If I operate it using the method for a Xuan Dan, wouldn't I be able to get Senior Brother Xiaobao out?"

"I don't know about that, but we can try."

---

Xue Jing retracted the hand he had hidden in his sleeve, which was holding the "River-Flowing Pill"—a potent laxative.

"Alright, let's give it a try," Li Mo said, patting his stomach.

"Okay, Junior Brother Li, I'll cooperate," Tang Xiaobao said, lightly jumping on a lotus petal.

So, Li Mo began to circulate his energy.

The liquid internal energy in his Dantian boiled instantly, just like before. The difference was that this time, there was an extra little sun.

The Dragon-Tiger Golden Core, which had already opened eight orifices, was mysterious and immense. It spun rapidly, radiating thousands of光辉.

Roar—

A phantom of a dragon and tiger suddenly appeared above Li Mo's head, imposing and majestic.

"This power..."

Li Mo felt the surging force within him, giving him a faint illusion of using the power of the World Seed.

He could definitely execute the "Seven Stabilizing Heavens" in its entirety.

Eager to test it, he threw a punch.

The turbulent wind, clouds, dragon, and tiger caused a storm within Xue Jing's Inner Scene.

Incredibly strong!

"A true Xuan Dan Realm cultivator probably wouldn't even have one-tenth of this power," Xue Jing said, his expression growing even more complex.

This was also because Li Mo's Dantian foundation was simply too good.

"Alright, you've played enough," Xue Jing said with a darkened face.

"Senior Brother Xiaobao, come out."

"Alright!"

Li Mo awkwardly stopped his movements.

Then, a faint light glowed from his Dantian.

A golden pill floated out, spun around a few times, and then fell to the ground, turning back into the young boy.

"How do you feel?" Xue Jing asked quickly.

"Pretty good," Tang Xiaobao replied, not feeling any discomfort. He even smiled and said, "And I don't need you to seal me anymore, Master. I can now control my own aura and prevent it from leaking."

Previously, Xue Jing had always worried that he would leak the pill's fragrance and aura, causing unnecessary trouble.

After thinking for a moment, he added, "Also, I feel that operating my energy together with Junior Brother Li is much stronger than when I do it alone."

"I've essentially experienced the Inner Scene Xuan Dan Realm in advance," Li Mo said, feeling a bit curious.

When he condenses his own Xuan Dan in the future, would he still be able to let Senior Brother Xiaobao turn into the Dragon-Tiger Pill and enter his Dantian?

He used the Eye of Fate to look at the current Tang Xiaobao.

He was now a purple-rank luck.

Seeing the young man deep in thought, Xue Jing's expression shifted slightly.

He thought of many things all at once.

Xiaobao had been on the Cauldron Peak for thousands of years.

He had been in contact with various elders over the centuries and was even stolen by a true disciple at one point.

Yet, he had such a奇妙 fate with Li Mo.

Fate was truly the most marvelous thing in the world...

He suddenly felt a bit wistful. "I should consider myself lucky that Xiaobao has taken a step closer to perfection during my generation."

"You can cooperate with each other. When the time comes, you can travel together into the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm."

"I can rest easy now."

The Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

Li Mo snapped back to attention upon hearing these four words.

Could this be related to "Ice Cube"?

After all, "Ice Cube" was still his number one backer.

"Yes, this is also thanks to your contribution," Xue Jing said as he sat down and brewed another cup of tea. He handed a cup to each of them before slowly continuing.

"The Blood Phoenix Secret Realm was originally the target of the Demonic Calling Sect. After the news leaked, they cleared out."

"They originally planned to use a sinister method to force the secret realm open, but had to give up halfway."

"Now, it can only accommodate those in the Divine Observation Realm to enter."

"The prodigies of the various sects in the Eastern Wilderness Domain, and even prodigies from other domains, will go there to explore."

...

PS: The realms in this book are: Qi Blood, Inner Scene, Divine Observation, Outer Scene, Law Body, Profound Mystery, Reaching the Heavens, and Immortal.

Xuan Dan is the late stage of the Inner Scene Realm.

There won't be too many messy, nested realms; they were fixed from the very beginning.

The protagonist's Immortal Body will start to show its greatest effect from the Divine Observation Realm onwards. As for the path Li Mo's Divine Observation will take, not a single reader has guessed it correctly yet, hehe.
