# Chapter 9: Formations

**Body: Fang Jun (Qi Condensation Level 3)**
Mana Capacity: 33167 wisps | Output: wisps

**Natal Artifact (1): Sky-Ruler Sword (Qi Condensation Level 4)**

**Natal Artifact (2): Primordial Spirit One (Qi Condensation Level 3)**
Mana Capacity: 30020 wisps | Output: wisps

Fang Jun sat cross-legged, his divine sense sweeping over the data provided by Primordial Spirit Two, a slight smile playing on his lips.

"After one battle, Sky-Ruler Sword's *Five Elements Art* improved to 6 wisps, reaching the mortal-grade limit for its level. Not bad at all." He muttered softly to himself, a hint of satisfaction in his tone.

Cultivators have their cultivation techniques, and artifacts have theirs. Natal artifacts and their cultivators are fundamentally one, so their cultivation techniques are naturally best aligned. However, humans and artifacts differ. A cultivator's technique cannot be directly applied to an artifact; it requires improvement and adjustment. This is why, even though Fang Tianxiong has reached Qi Condensation Level 9, his natal artifact has only progressed to Qi Condensation Level 7.

For Fang Jun, this was no problem at all. He excelled at using mathematical tools to deduce and optimize problems related to cultivation techniques. What others saw as difficult problems were effortless for him. Now with Primordial Spirit One, it was like adding wings to a tiger.

However, even this had reached its limit. Cultivation techniques in the immortal cultivation world are divided into four major grades: Mortal, Spirit, Immortal, and Dao. Between each grade lies an unbridgeable chasm. No matter how much a mortal-grade cultivation technique's framework is optimized, it's impossible to deduce it to the spirit grade. The difference is like that between a car and an electric car; they may appear similar on the outside, but their core mechanisms are vastly different. Unless Fang Jun could access a spirit-grade cultivation technique, deducing one from scratch would take an unknown amount of time.

"Alert! Alert! Unknown personnel are deducing the administrator's heavenly secrets!"

The mechanical voice of Primordial Spirit One suddenly rang out. At the same time, Fang Jun's heart tightened as a faint, elusive sense of being spied upon coiled around him like a venomous snake.

"Counter-attack in progress..."

"No! Cease counter-attack. Change to an algorithm for luring the enemy deep," Fang Jun calmly commanded with his divine sense.

"Command received. Switching to lure-the-enemy-deep mode..."

He sneered. For him to be able to detect the deduction of heavenly secrets, the opponent's methods were clearly mediocre. As for who was behind it, he already had a good idea.

"If the opponent is superior and sets a trap in return, then I might not escape today." Fang Jun muttered softly, then shook his head. "But if that were the case, the opponent would likely be beyond my resistance, so there's no point in overthinking it."

He lightly tapped his finger, and a faint light flashed as several storage bags floated before him. Apart from Yang Yuwan's, which he didn't have time to retrieve, all the storage bags of the Fang family members he had killed were here. Among them, Fang Ru's storage bag was the most valuable. Unfortunately, most of the items inside were personal belongings. Though luxurious and exquisite, they were difficult to convert into cash—if sold secondhand, they might not even fetch ten percent of their original price. The most valuable item was a Beast-Taming Whip. For him, it had no value other than exchanging it for spirit stones.

Fang Jun emptied these storage bags, taking out about a hundred low-grade spirit stones. While not a large amount, it was enough for him to set up a small formation.

"Scanning mountain and earth meridians..."
"Deducing formation model..."
"Establishing a three-dimensional coordinate axis with the administrator as the origin..."
"*Spirit Sword Gathering Array* is in preparation..."
"Please proceed to coordinates (362, 64, 15) to set up the formation..."

The voice of Primordial Spirit One rang in his mind, and a three-dimensional topographic map of the mountains immediately appeared before Fang Jun's eyes. He narrowed his eyes slightly. Use one's strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses—since he intended to lure the enemy deep, how could he lack the aid of a formation? He never fought unprepared battles.

Fang Family Residence, main house.

Fang Tianxiong cupped his fists and respectfully said to an elder, "I trouble Daoist Huiming."

Daoist Huiming's expression was calm. "Taking people's money and solving their problems is only right."

Fang Tianxiong nodded slightly. "Daoist friend traveled a long way from Observation Heaven Palace. This favor, I, Fang, will bear in mind."

Daoist Huiming said no more, taking out a bronze Eight Trigrams compass from his storage bag. The compass was ancient and heavy, its surface covered with carved star and constellation runes. Daoist Huiming lightly tapped his fingertip, and mana surged from his Dantian, flowing through his meridians into the compass. Countless starlight rose from the compass, transforming into a miniature sea of stars, suspended in mid-air.

"Heavenly secrets guide the way, causality traced to its source." Daoist Huiming let out a low cry, forming a hand seal with his left hand and drawing runes in the void with the index finger of his right hand. The sea of stars on the compass surged accordingly, countless tiny points of light appearing and gradually condensing into a blurry phantom image of mountains and rivers.

Half an hour later, the phantom image of mountains and rivers in the center of the sea of stars finally became clear—it was the depths of the East Mountain in Beixin Town. Daoist Huiming took a deep breath, then exhaled another stream of mana, injecting it into the compass. The phantom image of mountains and rivers collapsed into a point of flowing light, which he directly struck into Fang Tianxiong's glabella.

"Follow this star-mark to track the enemy; the error will be no more than ten zhang," Daoist Huiming said, his voice slightly weary.

Fang Tianxiong closed his eyes for a moment, then a cold light flashed in them. "So he's hiding deep in the mountains."

After Daoist Huiming left, Fang Ming pushed open the door, his tone urgent. "Father, is there any trace of that bastard?"

Fang Tianxiong sneered. "I have locked onto his position. This time, I will bring out the clan's treasure to ensure absolute certainty and completely eradicate him."

A hint of viciousness flashed in Fang Ming's eyes. "I originally planned to personally finish him off after returning from the High Sect, but unfortunately, leaving him alive is ultimately a hidden danger."

Fang Tianxiong patted his son's shoulder. "I am very pleased that you have this resolve, my son. The path of immortal cultivation is fraught with danger at every step; threats must be nipped in the bud. If I had realized this earlier, your mother wouldn't have..."

Fang Ming interrupted, "Father, there's no need to blame yourself. If I hadn't left that bastard alive, I wouldn't have been able to seize his opportunity through the *Bloodline Fortune-Seizing Art* and successfully enter the High Sect."

Fang Tianxiong's brows furrowed slightly. "This matter must never be spread, or it will surely bring fatal disaster."

Fang Ming nodded, but a hint of greed flashed in his eyes. "I just don't know what kind of bewitching potion that bastard fed to Fairy An. Fifteen years have passed since they parted at five years old. To think she'd be willing to save a High Sect outer disciple slot for him." He sneered softly, "No matter. Once I activate the *Bloodline Fortune-Seizing Art*, all of it will belong to me."

Fang Ming hesitated slightly, then asked, "Father, is that *Bloodline Fortune-Seizing Art* truly harmless?"

Fang Tianxiong's gaze was profound as he slowly said, "Your father cannot guarantee absolute certainty, but you must remember that the path of immortal cultivation is like sailing against the current; one either advances or retreats. If you do not strive for opportunities, you will struggle to glimpse the Grand Dao your entire life."

Fang Ming said solemnly, "Your son will remember Father's teachings."

Fang Tianxiong: "Then I shall go!"

Fang Ming: "I wish Father success!"
