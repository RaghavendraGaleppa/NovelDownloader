# Chapter 127: Crossroads of Life

Before he knew it, it was early spring, and the Outsider Lands, Esoteric Sects, and special higher academies had all begun recruiting disciples.

Qin Ming pondered. He had once again arrived at a critical juncture in his life, a choice that would determine his future. Standing at an important crossroads, which path should he take?

Meng Xinghai spoke, "I used to think you should go to one of the special higher academies. They are quite extraordinary, backed by unfathomable powers. Their purpose is to counterbalance the ancient thousand-year-old aristocratic families, so they naturally wouldn't care about pressure from the Cui family."

In the Night Mist World, there's a saying: "Dynasties flow like water, but aristocratic families are forged in iron." The latter have existed for a considerable time, with some individual families having thrived for over three thousand years. They are deeply rooted, involved in various fields and paths. Even many renowned figures within the Outsider Lands and Esoteric Sects originate from these aristocratic families, wielding significant influence. In the past, a "Blood and Iron Dynasty" once annihilated an ancient aristocratic family. However, a small group of people from the Outsider Pure Land returned, rebuilt the family, and even caused that dynasty to inexplicably collapse in the end.

Meng Xinghai continued, "Now I believe, with your talent, it would be a tremendous waste if you didn't go to the ancestral grounds of some great sects!"

Initially, while he recognized Qin Ming's potential, he considered the fierce competition within those renowned orthodoxies. For safety, he felt it wasn't advisable for Qin Ming to go there. The cruelty involved various aspects. For instance, the bloodline descendants of sect elders, having grown up there, often received preferential treatment and had many privileges. As for aristocratic family disciples, they inevitably brought large amounts of resources when joining, starting at a high point. Furthermore, there were often "bloody trials" within the sects, where certain stages were akin to "raising poisonous insects" (gu). If one didn't transform into a butterfly and break free from the "gu pot" early enough, they wouldn't enter the sight of the influential figures. At that time, if Qin Ming accidentally offended someone, leading to underhanded tactics, it would be quite dangerous.

Looking at it now, Meng Xinghai believed that with Qin Ming's talent, even at those legendary ancestral grounds, he could compete with "great openness and boldness."

Qin Ming naturally yearned for certain legendary scriptures, but counting on his fingers, his options were truly limited. For example, the Jade Purity lineage certainly had an astonishing background, but it had been sealed for over two hundred years. They had only recently allowed registered disciples to descend the mountain, and it was unknown if they would widely recruit new disciples this year. Then there was the Tathagata lineage, clearly engaged in "raising gu" and "planting cicadas." Even an unconventional and brawny special ability user disciple like Xiang Yi Wu had been released by them. The Six Supremacies lineage had even more serious issues. The sect's patriarch was about to pass away, and the influential figure from the Outsider Lands who had once been slapped was closely watching, indicating potential turmoil. Subsequently, Qin Ming also considered the Yin-Yang Temple, Pure Yang Palace, and other such places, all within his evaluation.

"Uncle Meng, which place has the most ancient texts and allows disciples to read them freely?" Qin Ming asked.

Meng Xinghai said, "If you have that inclination, then naturally it would be certain academies. They were established precisely to break the monopoly of the thousand-year-old aristocratic families." After a moment of thought, he continued, "In fact, several of the special higher academies also have quite the origins. There might be patriarch-level figures supporting them from behind. If you are brilliant enough, you should be able to draw them out."

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming couldn't help but be shocked. Could these academies be backed by figures like Qingtian, Tathagata, or the Six Supremacies? That would be truly astonishing.

"Because some great sects are close to becoming ancestral dojos for their descendants. The aristocratic family lineages and elder lineages are deeply intertwined, and it's all their descendants there. Some patriarchs, who emerged from long years of secluded cultivation, were enraged and wished they could establish new sects." Meng Xinghai believed that the supporters behind each of the special higher academies varied. Some were old monsters from the "Path of New Life," while others might be influential figures from Esoteric Sects or the Outsider Pure Land.

Qin Ming mused, saying, "It's not impossible for me to lie low, collect scriptures on my own, and rise through arduous cultivation."

Meng Xinghai shook his head and said, "Whether you choose a renowned great sect or a special higher academy, I will support you. You need to have this kind of experience. There, you can witness a broader world, obtain various secret teachings, and encounter prodigies from all corners of the land. Some will become lifelong confidantes or intimate companions. This is an indispensable and precious experience on your life's path." Meng Xinghai emphasized that this experience was extremely important, surpassing arduous cultivation itself. In such places, there were vast resources of ancient texts, and more importantly, significant connections. These were definitely not something one could obtain by simply burying oneself in solitary practice.

Meng Xinghai reminded him that the core disciples of those special higher academies and renowned great sects were undoubtedly special ability users. The truly formidable figures had yet to fully emerge. "Sparring and interacting with them will be very helpful for you at this stage. You might even meet people who will influence your entire life."

Qin Ming noticed that Meng Xinghai was deeply moved. He figured Meng Xinghai must have gone through similar experiences in his youth, leaving a profound and lasting impact on him.

"Uncle Meng, what are you reminiscing about? Who are you remembering?" Qin Ming asked abruptly.

"You brat..." Meng Xinghai snapped back to reality, reaching out a finger and almost poking him on the forehead.

Meng Xinghai said, "I'm telling you this as someone who's been there: you can't skip the experiences you're supposed to have. Simply keeping a low profile and hiding away isn't enough. If your horizons aren't wide enough, it will affect the height and depth of your life. To become a young grandmaster, your vision must be broad enough, otherwise, it will hinder your path forward."

Qin Ming nodded immediately, humbly accepting.

"Right now, if you want to go to better places, you'll need to perform exceptionally well. Perhaps you'll need to spar with the 'Number Ones' from other cities. While gaining some benefits from victory, you'll also increase your own 'worth.'"

After Meng Xinghai finished, the conversation became much lighter. He mentioned that after Li Qingyun returned, arrangements should soon be made for Qin Ming to examine the complete secret tome.

"Uncle Meng, you're really good to Qingyue." Qin Ming was a little suspicious. Could old Meng possibly have some blood relation to Li Qingyue?

Meng Xinghai laughed, "What are you thinking? Her father saved my life, and her mother is my senior sister. Our two families have an incredibly close relationship."

A middle-aged man in black entered the living room and reported, "City Lord, we have distinguished guests."

"Oh?" Meng Xinghai was surprised.

The man in black was Meng Xinghai's confidant, handling many of his trivial matters. He whispered, "City Lord Qi Daoming of Zhuguang City has arrived."

"It's him, interesting. He came so quickly." Meng Xinghai nodded, instructing his confidant to arrange a banquet, and stood up himself.

Seeing this, Qin Ming naturally prepared to take his leave.

Meng Xinghai said, "What the visitor wishes to discuss probably concerns you."

Qin Ming looked at old Meng, puzzled.

Meng Xinghai explained, "Qi Daoming is the son-in-law of the Li family, a very formidable individual. Last time, Li Qingxu's cousin, that child Li Qingxiao, suffered a loss here. He was kicked twice by my chosen 'Number One,' which is you, so he probably went back and filed a complaint. Oh, and most importantly, this Li family son-in-law, Qi Daoming, used to compete with me back in the day. It seems various matters have converged this time, and he wants to challenge you to a duel."

Qin Ming realized something and said, "So his chosen 'Number One' wants to duel me?"

Meng Xinghai nodded and said, "That's roughly it. This person was indeed formidable back then. He came from humble origins, but he suppressed many of his peers on the 'Path of New Life' to the point of suffocation. In one particular competition, he defeated seventy-two opponents in a row, reaching the top of a region and gaining widespread renown. Later, he was found to be able to walk the path of the Outsider Pure Land, so he decisively changed his path, becoming even more powerful. He also caught the attention of the Li family and became their son-in-law."

"Uncle Meng, have you ever sparred with him?" Qin Ming asked.

Meng Xinghai nodded, "We had one exchange on the Path of New Life, with no clear victor. We haven't crossed paths since we each changed our paths."

As Qin Ming departed, he saw a middle-aged man entering the manor from afar. He exuded an air of transcendence, clearly an extraordinary individual. Walking through Crimson Glow City, he felt a bit lost in thought. He hadn't been here long, yet he had surprisingly developed some feelings for the place.

Before leaving, Qin Ming felt he should complete certain tasks. He had promised to find spiritual substances for Yuque (Sparrow) and Chiying (Red Eagle) but hadn't fulfilled his promise yet. Their assistance in the desert battle had been invaluable.

Shortly after, Qin Ming paid a visit to the Sun family and gifted Madam Sun a hammer technique manual he had personally written. Now that the Xinyi Hall's bullying was gone, the old woman's living situation, along with her three-year-old grandson, immediately improved. The thirty pieces of Daygold Qin Ming had given her initially were more than enough for her to raise her only grandson.

"Child, thank you!" Madam Sun looked at the completed hammer manual, and murky old tears flowed down her face. She wanted her three-year-old grandson to kowtow to Qin Ming, knowing that this could change her grandson's life destiny. Qin Ming quickly supported them, then swiftly departed.

Soon after, he entered the mountains. With his current skills, finding spiritual substances that could cause a third mutation was naturally effortless. Even if he encountered an Outer Saint-level anomalous being, as long as it wasn't a deeply ancient monster, Qin Ming could still smash it to death.

"Mountain Lord, you weren't just saying it casually; you actually remembered little Yuque's matter! I'm so touched, I can actually evolve again! I'm so happy I could cry!" Yuque hadn't left, residing in Crimson Glow City and often going into the mountains with Wu Zheng, who also came from Black White Mountain. Yuque blinked its large, black gem-like eyes and said, "Mountain Lord, why don't you consider letting me follow you? Little Yuque here is quite extraordinary; I've already developed divinity and can potentially walk the path to becoming a god in the future."

"I might be going on a long journey; you with your family aren't suitable," Qin Ming said. Afterwards, he went to see Chiying.

In the evening, Meng Xinghai's expression wasn't very good. He called Qin Ming over.

"Was Qi Daoming too excessive?" Qin Ming asked.

Meng Xinghai shook his head and said, "No, he's quite particular about how he does things. He'll only brush against red lines he shouldn't cross; he won't overstep. The Cui family has sent people to see you. Be mentally prepared."

Qin Ming's gaze narrowed. The Cui family, from Qinghe City, a thousand-year-old behemoth. He had lived there for ten years and had already severed ties, so why were they appearing again? Moreover, seeing Meng Xinghai's expression, he already knew that the visitors were likely lacking good intentions towards him.

"Alright, Uncle Meng, I'll go meet them!" Qin Ming nodded. The Cui family was still a formidable mountain to him, but no matter what, he would eventually have to face them in the future to retrieve the silk scrolls.

"Don't worry, I've got everything covered!" Meng Xinghai patted his shoulder and said, "Just go, do what you need to do, and don't be afraid!"
