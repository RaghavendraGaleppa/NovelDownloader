# Chapter 132: Earth Armor Dragon

**Water Mansion**

After discussions with Fu Song and Zhang Jingxiu, Zhou Qing agreed to Jin Guang's request. During the Pill Origin Gathering, Fu Song and Zhang Jingxiu also found several items beneficial to them. Of course, all expenses were covered by "Zhou Zhenren" (Realized One Zhou). Zhang Jingxiu felt slightly embarrassed as he had also picked something for Xiao Ruowang.

The most significant gain was a single grain of Geng Metal. Zhou Qing immediately began refining it. Slowly, Geng Metal Qi entered his body, forming Lung Metal Qi. The process was excruciating, but according to feedback from his "Yang Sheng Zhu" (Life-Nurturing Master), the cultivation progress of his Lung Metal Thunder advanced steadily with the aid of the Lung Metal Qi.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye. Observing his progress, Zhou Qing noted that his Lung Metal Thunder was nearing proficiency. 

Demonic cultivation was not an instantaneous transformation but a gradual descent. Most demonic cultivators might collapse mentally within fifty to sixty years of demonic seeding, succumbing entirely to slaughter. Only Zhou Qing, relying on his forged Dao Furnace, dared to refine Geng Metal into his body.

With a thought, the nine drops of Primordial Heavy Water residing in his Dao Furnace flew out.

Zhou Qing rolled his eyes. "Fine, I'll find you one with a fiery temper."

His sword energy surged like flowing water, striking the Earth Armor Dragon and leaving countless wounds. Yet, the creature's regenerative ability, astonishing even to Zhou Qing, allowed the injuries to heal visibly under his "Pervasive Insight Eyes."

The Earth Armor Dragon erupted with its full Earth Elemental demonic power, forming a yellow protective shield over its body. Simultaneously, its demonic energy rapidly depleted.

Zhou Qing and his two companions focused on eliminating Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts.

A massive Earth Armor Dragon appeared, resembling a pangolin. It was the strongest among the beasts assaulting Desolate Ridge. With Zhou Qing handling it, the pressure on Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song lessened significantly.

Under the intimidation of Zhou Qing's divine sense, the Earth Armor Dragon reacted sluggishly. Within the frosty domain of his "Frostbound World," the surrounding earth hardened like steel.

The Earth Armor Dragon, sensing the terrifying energy of Zhou Qing's "Tripartite Convergence Qi"—a fusion of Qi, Body, and Spirit—felt the threat of death. A crane's cry seemed to echo from the heavens, amplifying the imposing aura.

Without protective formations, the cultivators of Tianxuan City would stand no chance against such a terrifying beast tide.

Moreover, Jin Guang subtly showcased his relationship with Zhou Qing to the Blood Demon Sect.

Now, Zhou Qing was just warming up.

The demonic cultivators of the Blood Demon Sect gathered on their spirit boat. Over a dozen Foundation Establishment-level demonic cultivators convened.

Zhou Qing remarked, "Temporarily subdued. After some taming, we'll see if it can serve as a guardian beast."

Unexpectedly, the Earth Armor Dragon still clung to life.

The outcome?

Other demonic cultivators gasped in shock.

Two promising Golden Core candidates, one notably younger than Jin Guang—the Blood Demon Sect's higher-ups knew exactly how to proceed.

Each drop of Zhou Qing's Primordial Heavy Water was immensely heavy, and with his magical power enhancement, their impact was terrifying. Nine drops smashed into the Earth Armor Dragon.

Meanwhile, the Tripartite Convergence Qi struck.

Geng Metal was exceedingly rare in the cultivation world. This tiny grain could serve as material for magic treasures or, when alloyed with any high-grade flying sword, elevate it to supreme-grade status while drastically increasing its sharpness.

Using Geng Metal like a spiritual pill to enhance his cultivation was exceptionally rare in the cultivation world. The Lung Metal Qi derived from it would daunt even late-stage Body Refiners of the Furnace Realm.

Thus, Jin Guang's standing within the Blood Demon Sect would rise.

"Desolate Ridge used to be Elder Qingmo's territory. Could the master of this market have ties to him?"

Zhou Qing's actions were unprecedented—using Geng Metal to boost his cultivation. The Lung Metal Qi it produced would intimidate even late-stage Body Refiners.

"This Desolate Ridge Market—what background does it have to withstand the beast tide alone outside Tianxuan City?"

Demonic cultivators who lost their minds within fifty years of demonic seeding were often mocked as jokes among their peers.

Zhou Qing wouldn't let the opportunity slip—his Azure Sun Spirit Fire erupted violently.

The earth before him undulated like a dragon turning over.

During beast tides, demonic beasts often turned on each other, though their primary target remained humans.

The Earth Armor Dragon's fear gradually turned into submission.

If no Golden Core-level demonic beasts emerged in the last beast tide, it was highly likely one would appear this time.

They had intended to exploit the chaos, but if the market's strength matched Qin Qing's claims, their plans might backfire.

The Earth Armor Dragon let out a piercing wail.

Heaven and earth seemed to tremble.

Qin Qing said, "I owe my Foundation Establishment Pill to him. Let's find the right moment to join forces with Desolate Ridge and annihilate this wave of the beast tide."

Of course, races like the White Moon Wolf Tribe, Unicorn Ox Demons, and Black Eagle Tribe, with their innate talents and mature structures, could produce Golden Core-level beasts even without a beast tide.

"Enough speculation. I've learned that the master of Desolate Ridge Market is a rogue cultivator named Qinglingzi at the Great Perfection of Foundation Establishment. He has two Body Refiners at the Furnace Realm by his side—one likely at late-stage, the other at mid-stage, who is also his senior brother." A dark green streak of light landed on the spirit boat.

Additionally, without the Blood Demon Sect Leader's威慑, dissent within the sect would have been vocal.

Half a day later, the demonic beasts retreated, preparing for their next assault.

Zhou Qing's Dao Furnace erupted, forming a massive energy sphere between his hands.

"What a monster."

Such individuals, in their eyes, lacked firm willpower and were unworthy of being cultivators.

Luo Xiangu and others, along with rogue cultivators who joined the market, activated Desolate Ridge's protective formation against the beast tide.

Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song quickly regained some vitality.

"Junior Brother, this thing is quite formidable. Did you subdue it?" Fu Song eyed the Earth Armor Dragon.

As the Earth Armor Dragon yielded, Zhou Qing fully unleashed his "Soul Bewilderment Art."

Compared to humans, the White Moon Wolf Tribe feared the resurgence of the Black Sun Tiger Tribe, the former overlords of Jingyang Dao Territory.

An extreme cold spread.

A tiny grain of Geng Metal, less than a third refined, had saved him nearly a year of arduous cultivation.

In an instant, the Primordial Heavy Water and Green Bamboo Sword returned to his body.

Jin Guang conveniently extended goodwill to Zhou Qing. If the Blood Demon Sect initiated friendly overtures, Zhou Qing would naturally recognize Jin Guang's intentions.

Zhang Jingxiu smiled silently nearby.

Multiple benefits achieved with one move.

Of course, the pressure on the Four Great Demon Sects paled in comparison to Tianxuan City's.

The Blood Demon Sect's demonic cultivators buzzed with discussion.

This Earth Armor Dragon exuded the aura of a fifth-tier demonic beast at late-stage Foundation Establishment, with extraordinary innate abilities. Its regenerative power was unlike anything Zhou Qing had encountered.

...

The Blood Demon Sect, the youngest among the Four Great Demon Sects, now rivaled the foremost Slaughter Life Sect by leveraging the benefits of beast tides.

It also recognized this human cultivator's strength and sought easier prey.

"Elder Qingmo is insignificant—he didn't even reach mid-stage Foundation Establishment at his death."

As the Thunder Light in the Earth Armor Dragon's wounds dissipated, its astonishing vitality took Zhou Qing by surprise.

This would benefit Jin Guang and Zhou Qing's subsequent plans.

The latent life force within its body erupted wildly.

While Zhou Qing and Zhang Jingxiu rested briefly, Zhou Qing glanced at the distant clouds. Through his Pervasive Insight Eyes, a faint outline of a massive spirit boat seemed to hover within.

Currently, only the Four Great Demon Sects in Jingyang Dao Territory possessed such capability.

After her rebirth, Qin Qing rapidly advanced to the ninth level of Qi Refinement and, with a genuine Foundation Establishment Pill, broke through to Foundation Establishment.

Each beast tide presented an opportunity for the Blood Demon Sect's expansion. Whether cultivator or demonic beast corpses, they were excellent materials for cultivating demonic entities.

Now, the Black Sun Tiger Tribe showed slight signs of recovery but, under the White Moon Wolf Tribe's surveillance, failed to produce a Golden Core-level beast.

Zhou Qing mused, "What, you want to seed a demon in it?"

Their bottom line was Tianxuan City's survival, but the Four Great Demon Sects also needed to strengthen themselves continuously.

Opening his Pervasive Insight Eyes, Zhou Qing observed the endless tide of demonic beasts and birds charging toward Tianxuan City—a truly awe-inspiring sight.

The Earth Armor Dragon had barely burrowed in when the spirit fire scorched it.

With Tianxuan City secure, they turned their attention to dividing the spoils of the beast tide.

Zhou Qing rolled his eyes, gazing at the distant Tianxuan City, where terrifying energy and demonic aura surged. He murmured, "The beast tide lasts seven days, intensifying over the first five before receding. Be cautious. If Desolate Ridge falls, we abandon it."

Perhaps demonic sect cultivators would seize the opportunity then.

...

Zhou Qing silently noted.

Normally, stabilizing one's Foundation Establishment required a hundred days.

But Zhou Qing's divine sense remained locked onto the Earth Armor Dragon.

Defending Desolate Ridge wasn't about preserving the market but securing enough demonic beast flesh and hides during the tide.

"If this beast weren't relying solely on instinct, it might have had the potential to become a sixth-tier Golden Core-level demonic beast," Zhou Qing marveled inwardly.

"True. The market's master must have other connections."

Moreover, the Four Great Demon Sects' headquarters were well-hidden, sparsely populated, and thus less likely to attract the beast tide's attention.

Luo Xiangu and others, with their experience defending Tianxuan City, quickly directed rogue cultivators to repair the protective formation for the next assault.

Hence, their lives were marked by urgency.

"Judging by the commotion, the Earth Armor Dragon must have retreated," one demonic cultivator remarked uncertainly.

Fu Song's mouth twitched before he coughed. "Actually, you know I'm not picky."

The Green Bamboo Sword unsheathed, unleashing endless sword energy like flowing water toward the Earth Armor Dragon. The beast curled into a ball, its massive form and scales as tough as high-grade defensive robes.

Fully demonized cultivators were essentially no different from demonic entities.

The might of heaven was unstoppable!

As the Earth Armor Dragon breached Desolate Ridge's protective formation, damage ensued.

The creature's resilience and regeneration were astounding.

Typically, two or three beast tides would spawn a Golden Core-level beast.

The beast tide erupted, with countless demonic beasts charging toward Tianxuan City. Desolate Ridge's market faced a smaller assault.

The Earth Armor Dragon's formidable regeneration and defense made it an ideal guardian spirit beast.

Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song seized the chance to catch their breath near Zhou Qing.

After delivering the Foundation Establishment Pill to the Blood Demon Sect, Jin Guang didn't conceal his actions. Knowing no Golden Core-level beings participated in this tide eased the human cultivators' burden.

Their "Young Master" was Qin Qing, the female demonic cultivator Zhou Qing had previously killed. Reborn through True Demon Blood, she consumed vast sect resources. Her memories halted long before entering the Divine Water Palace.

Without Zhou Qing's pure magical power and his Foundation Establishment-level cultivation surpassing late-stage capabilities, such maneuvers would have exhausted him.

The Four Great Demon Sects had contributed in past tides, but this time, they might stir trouble.

Resisting the beast tide outside the city was an extraordinary feat.

Zhou Qing moved swiftly to the ground.

Receiving a Blood Sword Message from the Blood Demon Sect, Zhou Qing initially feared his killing of their members had been discovered—the voice belonged to Qin Qing.

His gaze sharpened.

"Good, good. This one's temper is mild."

Many demonic cultivators refused to admit that, fully demonized, they ceased to be themselves.

The recent wave left many demonic beasts dead.

Zhou Qing's group defended a position outside Tianxuan City, forming a pincer with it.

All nine drops of Primordial Heavy Water struck the Earth Armor Dragon's wounds.

Zhou Qing was taken aback.

However, he soon exclaimed in surprise.

Yet, the creature clung to life.

Desolate Ridge claimed few demonic beast corpses, as retreating beasts carried their dead away.

Naturally, it attracted a wave.

But this thing still hadn't died.

Desolate Ridge Market drew the tide's attention due to its proximity to Tianxuan City and bustling activity.

Compared to Tianxuan City's scale, it was insignificant.

The Green Bamboo Sword transformed into a colossal thunder blade, mercilessly descending!

"Greetings, Young Master."

Tianxuan City's protective formation had long been activated, its massive barrier repelling countless beasts. Yet, many breached the shield, pouring in.

In mountainous terrain, even a Great Perfection Foundation Establishment cultivator would struggle against it.

The Earth Armor Dragon lay mangled before Zhou Qing.

The outer city was littered with traps, with Qi Refinement cultivators cooperating and Foundation Establishment experts handling their counterparts.

"Everyone, beware! An Earth Armor Dragon has breached Desolate Ridge!" Fu Song bellowed.

Soon, countless fragments of frozen earth scattered.

The Earth Armor Dragon's wounds became a bloody mess.

Fu Song waved dismissively. "This one's too docile. I prefer fiery tempers."

Slash!

The thunderous blade struck deeply, leaving a fissure in the Earth Armor Dragon's massive body, with green thunder light flickering within.

But Tianxuan City had inner and outer sections.

Frostbound World.

The Earth Armor Dragon sensed the terrifying thunder aura—demonic beasts instinctively feared lightning.

...

The beast tide's assaults followed certain patterns, where Luo Xiangu's experience proved invaluable.

The Earth Armor Dragon now feared Zhou Qing utterly, daring not resist.

...

At the bottom of the demonic cultivators' hierarchy.

The Earth Armor Dragon's endurance far exceeded Zhou Qing's expectations.

Within moments, its flesh began regenerating rapidly.

Simultaneously, potent Earth Elemental demonic power erupted as it attempted to burrow again.

...

Their lives were markedly shorter than ordinary cultivators'.

Yet, they also consumed other demonic beasts to strengthen themselves.

"Perhaps it was suppressed."

They were familiar with the Earth Armor Dragon—a notoriously troublesome fifth-tier demonic beast at late-stage Foundation Establishment, adept at earth遁.

Moreover, once used, Geng Metal couldn't be re-extracted.

Transforming into a massive thunder blade.

Now, he immediately deployed his divine sense to invade the Earth Armor Dragon's consciousness, establishing a spiritual link via beast-taming arts used on the serpent.

"Congratulations, Young Master, on regaining Foundation Establishment."

After receiving the message, Zhou Qing fell into thought.

They sought cooperation.

Was this a joke?
