# Chapter 23: The Relic of Divine Wood Sect

Dressed in black, with a straight back, a rather cold and arrogant expression, and eyes as sharp as lightning.

It was Leng Quan, whom he hadn't seen in years.

He had now entered the fifth layer of Qi Condensation, considered a minor expert in the market. Hearing Lu Xu's voice, Leng Quan turned around, a faint smile appearing on his stern face.

"So it's Brother Lu. Indeed, it's been many years since we last met!"

"How have you been, Brother Leng?"

"Still the same, a life of licking blood from the blade's edge. But Brother Lu, you're impressive! You're already at the third layer of Qi Condensation!"

A look of awe flashed in Leng Quan's eyes. It was a good thing he didn't know Lu Xu was already at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation. Otherwise, wouldn't his eyeballs pop out in shock?

It had only been seven years since Lu Xu embarked on the cultivation path. Reaching the third layer of Qi Condensation in seven years was already considered fast. As for the fourth layer, he truly hadn't heard of anyone like that. After all, the early-stage bottleneck wasn't easy to overcome. It was said that only spiritual roots of middle-to-high grade or above could bypass this bottleneck.

"Just now, I seemed to hear a group of people talking about the Divine Wood Sect relic. Brother Leng, have you heard about it?" Lu Xu asked directly.

Upon hearing this, a flicker of excitement and longing immediately appeared in Leng Quan's eyes, as if he couldn't wait to appear inside that relic. He suppressed the agitation in his heart: "Of course I've heard about it. It's been the talk of the town among us adventurous cultivators."

"More than ten days ago, someone discovered a damaged formation in the Myriad Demon Mountain Range. After breaking it, they found nothing but ruins inside, suspected to be a relic! After exploring for a bit, this person found that the depths of the relic were guarded by an even more powerful formation. Unable to break it, they came to the market to seek the help of formation masters! But somehow, the news leaked out. It's likely that soon everyone in the entire market will know!"

"Is this news reliable?" Lu Xu felt some apprehension.

"Absolutely true. Dozens of people have already gone to the relic to verify it, and through some markings, they've identified it as the Divine Wood Sect's relic! They also couldn't break the formation, so they all rushed back to the market to seek help. Now, almost all adventurous cultivators in the entire market are about to set out!" Leng Quan said excitedly.

For cultivators like them, who live on the edge, the allure of such a relic was simply too strong. The Divine Wood Sect was a sect from thousands of years ago, originally the hegemon of the Wei Kingdom, but then it mysteriously disappeared. Only then did powers led by the Thousand Severing Sect rise. How many rare treasures must such a powerful sect's relic contain?

Just by looking at the defensive strength of the formation, one could tell that this relic was extraordinary. Not to mention magic tools and cultivation methods, how many spiritual medicines must have grown over thousands of years? What if it contained the essential spiritual medicines needed for Foundation Establishment? Wouldn't that allow someone to ascend to heaven in one step? After thinking of all this, which adventurous cultivator could possibly hold back? Everyone was going crazy; even the Mo Family probably couldn't sit still now!

"Brother Lu, I'm going to explore it. Do you want to come?"

Hearing this, Lu Xu quickly shook his head: "Forget it. My cultivation is too low; I won't join the excitement!"

Leng Quan shook his head regretfully: "Brother Lu, this is a great opportunity that could lead to Foundation Establishment!"

"Fine, if you don't want to go, I won't force you. I'm definitely going to try my luck in this relic. Farewell for now!" Leng Quan cupped his hands and strode away.

Lu Xu walked towards the market's trading zone. When he arrived, he found it quite deserted. Not to mention customers, even the number of stall owners was sparse. Yin Yu, Gao Tianqiang, and the others were all gone.

"Could they all have gone to explore that relic?" A doubt flashed in Lu Xu's mind.

"Divine Wood Sect... just by hearing the name, I know this sect is fated with someone like me, who has a wood spiritual root. Unfortunately, anything related to a Foundation Establishment opportunity will surely attract Foundation Establishment cultivators! Forget my current Qi Condensation Layer Four cultivation, even if I were at Layer Ten, I'd still have to be cautious. I can't take this risk!" Lu Xu thought to himself. After all, he wasn't like Leng Quan, who had to risk his life to climb higher. Possessing a cheat, he naturally had to develop steadily and prioritize caution.

After walking around, Lu Xu found that apart from some stalls selling talismans and magic tools, which were doing brisk business, other areas were very quiet. "The more chaotic the times, the more money those selling weapons make!" Lu Xu sighed in his heart and turned to go home.

As he stepped into his courtyard, he saw a very unfamiliar-looking old man appear in front of Old Man Xu's door. "Fellow Daoist is... wait, this aura?" Lu Xu's eyes widened.

"What, kid Lu, can't you recognize me?" A hoarse voice sounded.

Although his appearance and voice had changed, Lu Xu still recognized him as Old Man Xu, based on his grasp of his demeanor and aura. "Old Xu, why do you look like this?"

"I'm leaving!" Old Man Xu said calmly.

"Leaving? Leaving the market?" Lu Xu was somewhat surprised.

"Yes. With the appearance of the Divine Wood Sect relic, this market probably won't be peaceful anymore. Before long, cultivators from all over the Wei Kingdom will rush here. It's going to get chaotic from now on!"

"Everyone else is seizing this opportunity to frantically make and sell talismans, yet you're leaving!"

"If it were before, I would also do that and seize the chance to make a fortune. But now, this old man has a grandson, has a legacy; I can't afford to take any risks!"

"True, stability is key. May your journey be smooth!"

The two drank a cup of spiritual wine. Lu Xu cupped his hands and watched as Old Man Xu, along with his grandson, whose appearance had also been altered by makeup, walked out of the courtyard.

Now, he was the only one left in the courtyard. "Is there still a need for me to stay here? Perhaps I should also seize this opportunity to leave!" The thought of leaving Qinghu Market also arose in Lu Xu's mind. He had long wanted to break free from the Mo Family, and now seemed to be an opportunity.

"Once the news spreads, cultivators from all over the Wei Kingdom will rush here. There will certainly be many people encountered along the way, and many dangers! I need to make some preparations, produce a few more mid-grade talismans for self-preservation!"

Lu Xu thought for a moment, then ran another errand to the small shop he had visited before. "Madam Wu, do you still have that Infernal Flame Thunder that this old man bought last time?"

"Old man, do you think this kind of thing is like cabbage? I've only received one such pellet in over a decade!"

Lu Xu left in disappointment, unable to obtain any good items from the old woman selling demonic magic tools. On his way back, he saw a team of people rushing out of the Mo Family's ancestral grounds, heading towards the outskirts of the market. A rough count showed there were forty to fifty people. The aura of the one leading them was unfathomable, definitely an expert above the eighth layer of Qi Condensation. Lu Xu's heart tensed, not daring to look further.

"Is the Mo Family going to explore the relic now? Heh, their family certainly benefits from being so close!" Lu Xu thought to himself.
