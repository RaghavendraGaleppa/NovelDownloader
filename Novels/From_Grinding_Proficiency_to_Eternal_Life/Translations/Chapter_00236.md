# Chapter 236: Granting You a Position

Xu Yunfan subconsciously touched the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace on his back, his heart filled with pleasant surprise.

He hadn't expected the Dragon Scale Armor and the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace to manifest with him into this dream. If that were the case, then...

Xu Yunfan's gaze toward the woman gradually became frivolous.

For the first time, the woman's expression showed a hint of surprise. The originally dull look in her eyes quickly became lively.

"You're not right."

"What's not right?"

Xu Yunfan casually asked, not immediately entering the Word of Confrontation state. He simply walked slowly toward the sword peak before him.

The woman said, "Your cultivation speed is too fast. In less than two years, you have already stepped onto the sixth step of the Martial Path."

Xu Yunfan exclaimed in surprise, "So you can speak. I thought you were just a wooden stump."

Hearing Xu Yunfan's teasing, the woman didn't get angry in the slightest. Perhaps because she had absorbed a great deal of spiritual energy, she looked Xu Yunfan up and down.

"Your aptitude is so poor, only slightly better than that Tunzai. Your progress in the Martial Path would have stopped at the fourth step at most... Have you eaten some kind heavenly treasure?"

Xu Yunfan's face darkened. Seeing the woman's utterly serious expression, completely devoid of any mockery, the corners of his eyes twitched slightly.

She was merely stating the facts objectively...

Facing Xu Yunfan's silence, a faint light shimmered in the woman's eyes. After calculating something in her mind, she finally spoke.

"Defeat me, and I shall grant you a Position."

"Position?"

This time it had changed. It wasn't about letting him go anymore, but granting him a Position.

Xu Yunfan was a bit puzzled, and his heart stirred slightly.

These ultra-ancient level experts had tried every means to put themselves into deep sleep. The woman before him had even found the extremely precious Source Ancient Jade Wall mentioned by Li Haomiao to seal herself, seeking to transform into an immortal.

But somewhere along the way, an unknown change occurred. Her body changed, and in the end, only a skin containing the secret method of the Word of Confrontation remained.

Now, it seemed she was slowly reviving relying on him.

"What Position? Please be clear."

Before Xu Yunfan's words had finished, the woman stopped speaking. Her wide sleeves suddenly rolled up like clouds, and her fingers formed a sword shape. A sword qi resembling water waves burst out instantly, surging toward Xu Yunfan.

The three-inch hairpin transformed into a seven-foot bronze sword against the wind. The Taotie patterns on the sword spine actually seeped out frost under the moonlight.

"Mace, come!"

The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace responded, rising from his back and piercing through the air to arrive. Xu Yunfan grabbed the dragon-head mouthpiece with one shoulder. The patterns on the heavy mace lit up one after another, trailing streams of fire as he moved.

His shoulder blades moved violently with a crack. A great force erupted from his flesh, muscles, tendons, and bones.

The unique bronze color of the Hundred-Forged Steel Body spiraled up from under his ribs. The arch tendons and membranes trembled like a subterranean dragon turning over. The black rock beneath his feet cracked with a sound, spreading out like a spider web.

*Clang!*

The moment the sword qi from the bronze sword collided with the heavy mace, nine spiraling forces exploded from the mace body.

The woman's wide sleeves suddenly billowed like sails. Her slender foot lightly tapped the end of the sword handle, actually卸力 (dissipating) the shock force capable of splitting mountains and cracking stones into the solitary peak beneath her.

The entire sword peak trembled violently, and countless rocks fell like a torrential rain.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted.

Her technique for卸力 (dissipating force) was far more exquisite than his Hundred-Forged Steel Body's method, a hundred times more exquisite, to be precise.

Damn it!

He let out a furious roar. The Black Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength climbed up his spine section by section. Mercury-like blood surged through his veins like magma.

The second mace swept toward the woman's lower body with the momentum of wind and thunder.

The scales on the waist and abdomen of the Dragon Scale Armor suddenly stood upright, spewing out a scorching heat wave that melted the frost sword qi diffusing around the woman into white mist.

However, in that instant, the woman's bronze sword strangely bypassed the mace tip, striking the mace body seven times with the sword tip, each strike exploding with ring-shaped air waves.

*Crack!*

Blood burst from Xu Yunfan's tiger's mouth. The "Shock" Word Technique of the Nine Profound亢 Dragon Mace was counterattacked by the seven-fold叠加 (superimposed) soft force.

He stomped his heel hard onto the rock layer. The unique force-dissipating ripples of the Hundred-Forged Steel Body spread from the soles of his feet, turning the rock surface within a three-zhang radius into powder.

With the help of the Dragon Scale Armor and the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, he could completely affect a ten-zhang range with pure destructive power. But to inflict damage on the mysterious woman before him, he needed to find a way to condense his strength, not leaking a single bit.

The woman floated back three zhang, and frost suddenly condensed on the sword edge.

Xu Yunfan sensed a dangerous aura, and the neck armor of the Dragon Scale Armor弹出 (sprang out) thirty-six crescent-shaped scales.

Almost simultaneously, the cold light drawn by the bronze sword had already reached his throat!

*Zing!*

The sword edge摩擦 (frictioned) against the逆鳞 (reverse scale), sparking dazzling sparks.

The woman's eyes moved, her gaze finally carrying a hint of surprise as she looked at the armor Xu Yunfan was wearing.

The armor he wore was extraordinary.

Xu Yunfan twisted his waist to generate force, utilizing the momentum. The heavy mace swept upward from below toward the woman's wrist holding the sword.

This move, "Dragon Raises Its Head," contained nine variations. The雷火 (Thunderfire) at the mace head was格开 (parried) by the回收 (retracted) sword edge before it could touch the fair wrist.

The sword edge looked as light as cotton, yet the absolute force unleashed when the sword edge struck the mace head made Xu Yunfan struggle to hold onto his weapon.

The two figures separated abruptly.

Xu Yunfan's back smashed through three lying-ox stones. The scorching breath喷吐 (spewed) by the Dragon Scale Armor熔ed (melted) the碎石 (shattered rocks) into glass.

The woman's wide sleeves were torn, revealing a red mark on her forearm grazed by the heavy mace. It was clearly a wound caused by the Nine Profound亢 Dragon Mace technique.

He had finally inflicted damage!

Xu Yunfan's heart was filled with excitement.

"Interesting."

The woman smiled for the first time, pointing her sword edge at Xu Yunfan's glabella.

"With your aptitude, you actually managed to achieve this. To force out thirty percent of my sword speed, you are the seventh in two thousand years."

Before her words faded, the nine sword peaks suddenly resonated.

Moonlight condensed into a tangible frost blade at the sword edge. Xu Yunfan felt as if his entire body's blood was freezing. He didn't even have time to think.

He frantically urged the Black Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength. Mercury-like blood and energy boiled within his body. The white mist喷出 (spewed) from the gaps in the Dragon Scale Armor伴随 (accompanied) the steaming blood and energy, actually forming a faint shadow of a Black Flood Dragon above his head.

Without the slightest hesitation, he placed his left hand横于胸前 (across his chest), forming a seal.

"Confront."

The Word of Confrontation was催动 (urged) to its limit. His thoughts halted abruptly. The world in Xu Yunfan's eyes slowed down instantly.

He看清 (saw clearly) the dozens of frequencies of vibration in the woman's sword edge. The "Break" Word Technique of the Nine Profound亢 Dragon Mace evolved corresponding changes in response.

The heavy mace, carrying magma-like blood and energy, slammed down violently. Nine layers of shock waves perfectly抵消 (counteracted) the sword edge's trembling force.

*Clang!*

The sound of metal clashing stirred up a ten-zhang high wave in the cold pool.

Xu Yunfan was震得 (shaken until) blood seeped from his seven orifices, yet his eyes remained as calm as an ancient well. He further frantically榨取 (squeezed) the potential deep within his body, wanting every cell to erupt with absolute force at this moment.

The muscles and tendons on his arms twisted like pythons. The physique of the Hundred-Forged Steel Body far exceeded its load-bearing capacity, and cracks appeared for the first time, spreading like a spider web.

However, the woman's sword momentum suddenly accelerated. The bronze sword幻化 (transformed) into thousands of afterimages under the moonlight.

His eyes darted frantically, desperately trying to capture the trajectory of the long sword.

But the real killing move appeared only now!

The sword edge suddenly vanished.

Xu Yunfan only saw the moonlight refracting seven layers of halo on the sword spine. The chill had already透胸 (pierced) through his chest.
