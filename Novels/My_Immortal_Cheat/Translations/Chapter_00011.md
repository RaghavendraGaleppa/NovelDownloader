# Chapter 11: Combination of Divine Abilities  

Tian Ling glanced at Zi Yuan's voluptuous chest, then down at her own flat one, and subtly moved closer to Zhou Tian.  

Zhou Tian felt the movement of the beauty beside him and smiled inwardly. Though Tian Ling possessed extraordinary talent, she was still just an innocent young girl at heart—shy and inexperienced. Expecting any intimate gestures from her now was unrealistic; it would take time to nurture that.  

To spare her feelings, Zhou Tian deliberately kept his gaze fixed ahead as he asked Zi Yuan, "Are there any matches today featuring fighters with over fifty wins?"  

The Imperial Capital Arena operated on a win-based ranking system. Those with fewer than fifty wins were generally below the Three Realms level and not worth watching. Only those with fifty or more victories held any real value as opponents.  

Zi Yuan found Zhou Tian's reaction intriguing. She was confident in her allure—while her looks were merely above average, her proportions were flawless. Few could ignore her, let alone a young man like Zhou Tian, brimming with youthful vigor.  

A sharp observer trained in reading people, she quickly realized Zhou Tian was being considerate of the inexperienced girl beside him. It seemed this young woman held a significant place in the heart of the Qin Prince's heir.  

After a moment's consideration, Zi Yuan adjusted her approach. She was one of the Imperial Capital Arena’s specially trained attendants, raised from childhood at great expense and assigned exclusively to the highest-tier VIP rooms. If favored by a powerful figure, the arena would pamper her until that patron returned—after all, no man wanted a woman he’d taken to be shared with others.  

Though she longed to attach herself to the young Qin Prince, reckless seduction could backfire. Countless attendants in the arena had met their end by angering the wrong noble. Until she understood the situation fully, caution was best.  

Adopting a professional demeanor, Zi Yuan straightened, her previously teasing posture replaced by modesty. The glimpses of her alluring figure vanished beneath proper attire as she replied respectfully,  

"Your Highness, there are two matches today featuring fighters with eighty wins."  

All traces of seduction had left her voice.  

Zhou Tian nodded in understanding. "Ah, so that’s why members of the royal family are here. How long until they start?"  

Achieving long win streaks in the arena was notoriously difficult. The first fifty matches were manageable, but beyond that, every battle was grueling, pitting fighters against ruthless veterans. Those who reached eighty wins were rare, their strength and combat experience exceptional.  

The last "Hundred-Battle King" had appeared three years prior, sparking fierce competition among the capital’s factions before being recruited by the royal family. Currently, the highest streak in the arena stood at ninety-five wins, drawing packed crowds for every match.  

"About half an hour," Zi Yuan answered.  

"That’s not too long. What other matches are happening now?"  

Since there was time to kill before the main event, Zhou Tian figured he might as well watch something else.  

Zi Yuan retrieved a black talisman disk from the air, channeled energy into it, and activated a projection screen. After scanning it briefly, she reported,  

"There are three matches at the fifty-win level and one at sixty."  

Zhou Tian led Tian Ling to a central red sofa upholstered in an unknown animal’s fur—thick, crimson strands as wide as thumbs, luxuriously soft to the touch. "Let’s watch the sixty-win match," he instructed.  

"As you wish."  

With a flick of her wrist, Zi Yuan manipulated the talisman disk. The white wall before them shimmered silver as intricate runes materialized, projecting a crystal-clear view of the sixty-win battle.  

This was an arena projection formation, meticulously replicating every detail of the fight and adjusting dynamically to the combatants’ movements—a feature exclusive to VIP rooms.  

"Pay close attention," Tian Ling murmured, her eyes gleaming with excitement.  

The current match featured two humans—a noteworthy detail, as non-human races often fought in the arena.  

Compared to the brawls on the first floor, this was a spectacle of true skill.  

**"Mountain-Shattering Fist!"**  

The younger of the two fighters roared, his body bloodied from the fierce battle. Clenching his fists, he summoned earthen-yellow runes that coiled around his hands. The faint silhouette of a towering mountain materialized behind him, radiating immense pressure—his Heaven’s Treasury divine ability, renowned for crushing opponents.  

But his adversary was no lesser. The middle-aged man, though also bloodstained, was clearly in better shape.  

Watching his opponent’s overwhelming strike, the man remained calm. Lightning crackled around him as his eyes flashed with electric light.  

**"Divine Thunder Judgment!"**  

A thunderclap boomed across the arena as dark clouds gathered overhead, blue lightning writhing within. This was his Heaven’s Treasury ability—control over thunder.  

**"Thunder Dragon’s World-Shaking Strike!"**  

A dragon-shaped bolt erupted from his arm. Lightning surged beneath his feet as he plunged into the storm. The clouds churned violently, condensing into a colossal thunder dragon so lifelike its whiskers lashed the air with arcs of electricity, its scales etched with glowing runes.  

**"A divine ability combination!"** Tian Ling gasped, her astonishment plain.  

Combining divine abilities—merging one’s innate powers from the Three Realms into a single, more potent technique—required immense talent and effort. Even in her sect, the Haotian Sect, only a handful could achieve it. To witness it here in a random match was astounding.  

"Is it really that impressive?" Zhou Tian asked, amused by her reaction.
