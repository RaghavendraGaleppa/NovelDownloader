# Chapter 53: Do You Have the Nine Dragon Black Flame Shield Here? [Tuesday, Seeking Follow-up Reads]

Cultivating for so long, the most enjoyable moments were during practice and attribute allocation—watching strands of magic power grow, seeing restrictions level up layer by layer. That sensation of growing stronger was addictive to Wang Chan.

If not for the time limits on cultivation and the caps on experience gain, Wang Chan would have happily secluded himself in cultivation every single day.

The second most enjoyable thing was counting his spoils.

Especially when thirty thousand magic coins were laid out before him—their glittering appearance was utterly mesmerizing. Wang Chan nearly pounced on them, wanting to gather them in his arms and count them one by one again.

But he restrained himself in the end. Even if his heart was bursting with joy, his face remained impassive.

We rogue cultivators must maintain composure even if Mount Tai were to collapse before us.

"Just thirty thousand magic coins—this is only the beginning."

An hour passed in the blink of an eye. By the time Wang Chan snapped out of his reverie, the pot of spirit tea on the table had already gone cold.

Not wanting to waste the twenty magic coins he'd spent, he tidied up the various items on the table and floor before picking up the teapot. After a quick inspection, he tilted his head back and downed it in one gulp.

Then he strode out the door.

Many of the spoils in his possession couldn't be openly displayed—they had to be laundered into clean magic coins.

Wang Chan's earlier wandering hadn't been in vain. Exiting the teahouse, he crossed a street and arrived at a shop with an extremely flashy name—[Treasure Pavilion].

Enter the shop.

Drink tea.

Under the attentive service of fair-skinned, long-legged, slender-waisted maids, he nibbled on some spirit fruits and pastries.

Before long, the late Qi Refining stage shopkeeper, with a beaming smile, invited Wang Chan into the VIP room.

From what Wang Chan knew, there were only two channels for fencing goods in the black market.

First, selling to shops.

Second, setting up a stall.

The former was relatively safer, especially when choosing reputable century-old establishments. There were rarely any issues, let alone future troubles. Moreover, their capacity was large—if the price was right, everything in his possession could be sold off within an hour. Easy as pie.

The only problem was that shops liked to lowball the prices.

Setting up a stall allowed for free pricing—a willing seller and a willing buyer. If the items displayed were truly rare, buyers might even compete with premium offers, allowing for higher profits.

However, stalls were crowded and chaotic. Displaying valuable items was like a child walking through a busy market holding gold—it was easy to attract unwanted attention. Though Wang Chan wasn't afraid of a fight, when traveling, it was best to avoid trouble where possible.

Most importantly, selling items one by one at a stall was far too slow.

As long as the shop didn't lowball too harshly, Wang Chan preferred to play it safe.

The VIP room's formation had soundproofing effects—once inside, all noise from outside was cut off. The spiritual incense inside was also refreshing and soothing, making it quite comfortable.

"May I ask what goods the fellow Daoist wishes to sell?" The old shopkeeper had a somewhat cunning appearance and, perhaps due to being busy, got straight to the point.

"What are your shop's purchasing policies?" Wang Chan asked unhurriedly.

"Depending on the quality of the goods, we generally offer forty to fifty percent below market price," the old shopkeeper said indifferently.

Wang Chan's expression didn't change, but inwardly, he wanted to spit in the old man's face. Fifty percent? Why don't you just rob me instead?

The goods in his possession were worth over twenty thousand magic coins. A fifty percent cut would mean losing at least ten thousand magic coins!

These were items he'd fought tooth and nail for, even at the cost of many talismans. Selling them like this would mean all that effort was for nothing—no different from working for scraps.

Seeing Wang Chan's lack of response, the old shopkeeper explained, "I presume the fellow Daoist is a sensible person. If these were legitimate goods, you wouldn't be selling them here. These things often come with complications, and we bear significant risks."

Wang Chan stared silently at the old shopkeeper.

"Perhaps the fellow Daoist isn't aware, but there are countless tracking spells and supernatural abilities out there. If the items in your hands only involve Qi Refining cultivators, that's one thing. But if they involve Foundation Establishment cultivators... heh, you likely don't understand how powerful they are. Just last year, a late Qi Refining cultivator refused to sell a valuable item. Before he could even walk half a mile after leaving the black market, a pursuing Foundation Establishment cultivator reduced him to ashes..."

"Twenty percent at most," Wang Chan cut him off, uninterested in the spiel.

"The fellow Daoist is welcome to try other shops," the old shopkeeper said, his smile vanishing as he gestured for Wang Chan to leave.

Wang Chan stood and walked out.

Half an hour later.

Wang Chan was thoroughly exasperated.

Every major shop in the area offered similarly low prices, no different from Treasure Pavilion. It seemed they were all in cahoots, squeezing the cultivators dry.

There were smaller shops, of course, where the price cuts weren't as severe—twenty to thirty percent.

But small shops lacked credibility, and their ability to handle complications was questionable, leaving potential risks.

Even thirty percent was too much.

Unable to find a suitable place, Wang Chan entered a spirit food restaurant, ate and drank his fill, and only then calmed down.

Handle urgent matters with patience.

The more rushed you are, the more likely things go wrong.

Wang Chan decided not to rush selling his spoils. Instead, he relaxed and wandered around.

Another half-hour passed.

As he strolled, a familiar figure suddenly caught his eye.

It was the floral-skirted female cultivator wearing the deer mask. She was gracefully squatting at a stall selling a few damaged low-grade magical artifacts, picking through them.

---

The stall owner, a female cultivator in a beige cloak, said coldly, "Fellow Daoist, feel free to pick whatever you want."

"Do you have the high-grade magical artifact Nine Dragon Black Flame Shield?" The floral-skirted cultivator picked up a bamboo-leaf artifact, idly toying with it as she asked indifferently.

The cloaked cultivator froze, then slowly shook her head.

"Do you have the high-grade magical artifact Flowing Cloud and Water Sword?" the floral-skirted cultivator pressed.

Again, the cloaked cultivator shook her head.

"Do you have the high-grade magical artifact Wind Thunder Boat?" the floral-skirted cultivator persisted.

The cloaked cultivator gave her an exasperated look before shaking her head once more.

All three were famous magical artifacts in the Cloud Mist Kingdom's cultivation world. The [Nine Dragon Black Flame Shield] originated from the Verdant Sun Sect, the [Flowing Cloud and Water Sword] from the Cloud Mist Sect, and the [Wind Thunder Boat] from the Wind Thunder Sect.

"Your selection is pitiful—you don't have this, you don't have that," the floral-skirted cultivator said impatiently. "Fine, how much for this chipped jade hairpin?"

"..."

Watching this, Wang Chan was torn between laughter and exasperation.

This floral-skirted cultivator was quite the character.

Before long, she successfully purchased the slightly damaged jade hairpin at a rock-bottom price.

Then, she turned to Wang Chan and smiled naturally. "What a coincidence, fellow Daoist."

"Coincidence indeed," Wang Chan replied with a cupped fist.

"How were your gains?" she asked again.

"Passable," Wang Chan answered offhandedly, glancing elsewhere as he prepared to move on.

Unexpectedly, the floral-skirted cultivator asked, "Might I ask, fellow Daoist, do you know which direction the Trading Hall is in?"

Trading Hall?

What was that place?

Wang Chan's interest was piqued.
