# Chapter 64: A Single Sword Suppresses a Grandmaster  

The sky was a clear blue, without a single cloud.  

Fierce winds howled across the heavens, only to be torn apart by sword energy as they drew near.  

Dou Changsheng, riding atop a sword formed from his true qi, followed the wooden bird in flight. When Jin Wuming suddenly stirred up trouble, Dou Changsheng couldn't help but shift his gaze toward him.  

He saw clearly as Jin Wuming abruptly made his move—arrogant and dismissive, as if the Pure Yang Grandmaster before him was nothing.  

When Jin Wuming suddenly pointed at him and accused him of fleeing, Dou Changsheng was momentarily stunned. But he quickly realized this was part of Jin Wuming's scheme. Just as Jin Wuming had predicted, Leng Wuye, the Pure Yang Grandmaster, had taken the bait.  

It wasn’t that Leng Wuye was incompetent—it was that Jin Wuming’s acting was simply too convincing.  

The deception was flawless. As Leng Wuye shifted his attention, Jin Wuming erupted into action. Strands of radiant light emerged from his wrist, spreading across his palm until his entire hand was enveloped in a dazzling, unstoppable brilliance.  

A mournful wail echoed through the heavens and earth—a sound filled with sorrow, resentment, and all the darkest emotions of the world.  

The sound carried an indescribable weight, dredging up painful memories and trapping the listener in despair.  

Jin Wuming was known as the "Heavenly Weeping Hand," having mastered the Divine Blood Sect’s supreme technique—the *Heavenly Lamentation Scripture*.  

His mastery of this art had reached its pinnacle.  

As the sorrowful sound stirred the heart, Jin Wuming’s own tears fell like rain, streaming down his cheeks and dropping to the ground like pearls.  

Leng Wuye sensed the danger. His right arm, encased in steel, swelled like living flesh, doubling in size until it was as thick as a water vat. His metallic fingers clenched into a massive fist, and with a thunderous roar, he launched a devastating punch toward Jin Wuming.  

The fist tore through the air like a meteor, its force shaking the heavens. The sheer pressure of the blow sent shockwaves rippling outward, the sound of displaced air booming like thunder.  

Before the fist even landed, its sheer force arrived first.  

One after another, lotus flowers of innate true essence bloomed in the air, forming a barrier to block the incoming strike. Yet despite this, Jin Wuming’s silver-white hair was violently whipped back by the force, and a thin cut appeared on his cheek, blood seeping from the wound.  

Though Leng Wuye had reacted swiftly, Jin Wuming’s palm strike still landed squarely on his right shoulder.  

The mighty punch, now missing its target, compressed the air with terrifying force before crashing into the ground. A deafening explosion followed as dust and debris erupted into the sky, the earth itself vaporizing under the impact, leaving behind a massive crater.

Jin Wuming shouted, "Hei Fu is one of the Ten Jie of the Mohist School! Though he is also a Pure Yang Grandmaster like you, he is like the rising sun, while you are already in decline. Give him ten years, and you won’t even be able to see his shadow!"  

"In terms of mechanical arts, you are far from his match!"  

"That famed 'Sacred Mechanical Fist' of yours? Hei Fu has already dismantled it—now it’s nothing more than an empty shell!"  

"With a sneak attack like this, a true Pure Yang Grandmaster could have easily blocked it. But you hesitated—proving that at best, you’re only at the level of a Divine Marvel Grandmaster now!"  

"Let’s strike together and take down Leng Wuye!"  

"The deputy sect master of the Mechanical Sect, a Pure Yang Grandmaster, the Sacred Mechanical Fist—such illustrious titles will become stepping stones beneath our feet!"  

"Today is the day our names shake the world!"  

Dou Changsheng glanced at Sun Duxiu, who floated gracefully like a fairy in the wind, and calmly said, "We can’t just stand by and watch Jin Wuming fall."  

"If we lose the 19th-ranked expert on the Human Rankings, we won’t be able to hold our own against Leng Wuye."  

"Let’s join forces and survive this ordeal first."  

Sun Duxiu agreed immediately. A man beside her tossed the object on his back forward—an ancient zither, which landed in her hands. Her delicate fingers gently stilled the trembling strings before plucking them lightly.  

A melody rose, and clouds gathered beneath her, forming a floating platform.  

Sun Duxiu sat cross-legged, the zither resting before her. Her voice, clear as silver bells, rang out:  

"I am not skilled in combat, so I can only play a tune for the Sword Lord."  

"Not long ago, I happened upon an ancient melody—one that can elevate one’s cultivation in the midst of battle."  

"With my abilities, I cannot help the Sword Lord break through to the Divine Marvel Realm. But I can assist in refining the Three Flowers, achieving the Three Flowers Gather at the Summit and the Five Qi Returning to the Origin—allowing him to temporarily reach the Profound Realm of the Innate Stage."  

Dou Changsheng gave Sun Duxiu a deep look. As the leader of the Eight Talents, she was no mere ornament. At this critical moment, she had revealed an extraordinary skill.  

A temporary breakthrough in battle, though fleeting, had immense benefits—not just for combat, but also for cultivation. It allowed one to experience the next realm in advance, reducing the time needed for future breakthroughs.  

This ancient melody was priceless.  

And the ability to play it was no small feat.  

He glanced at the group of admirers surrounding her. No wonder even Chen Weiquan was among them—there were tangible rewards to be had.  

The zither’s melody was soft and ethereal.  

Above Dou Changsheng, the first of the Three Flowers—the Human Flower—bloomed, followed by a second, though still illusory.  

Chen Weiquan, witnessing this, narrowed his eyes. The last time he had seen Dou Changsheng, the young man hadn’t even completed the Five Qi. Now, two of the Three Flowers had already manifested.  

How much time had passed since then?  

Too fast.  

A sense of despair crept into his heart.  

*Is this what true genius looks like?*  

No wonder Fire Cloud True Man had declared that the next decade would belong to Dou Changsheng.  

In Chen Weiquan’s eyes, Fire Cloud True Man had even been too conservative. Dou Changsheng wouldn’t need to wait until twenty—he would claim the top spot on the Human Rankings long before then, standing unrivaled above all others.  

With the Three Flowers in bloom—even if one was still illusory—Dou Changsheng’s cultivation was forcibly elevated to the Profound Realm of the Innate Stage.  

The innate true qi within him began to transform, swiftly condensing into innate true essence.  

The true essence surged through his meridians, expanding them and raising his limits before flooding into the five major acupoints, refining the innate qi within.  

Dou Changsheng drew the Hero’s Sword from its sheath, realizing that the Mechanical Sect’s greatest mistake had been gathering all of them together in one place.  

He charged forward, sword in hand.  

With this single strike, his divine intent surged, and his sword’s will spread outward.  

Ordinary techniques were useless here—against a Divine Marvel Grandmaster, they were far too crude. Without mastery over divine intent, one didn’t even qualify to fight.  

Dou Changsheng unleashed his innate true essence without restraint.  

The Hero’s Sword erupted with sword energy.  

A fist met the blade in midair, sparks exploding from the collision.  

The sheer force of Dou Changsheng’s true essence sent Leng Wuye staggering back.  

Dou Changsheng’s confidence solidified.  

Jin Wuming hadn’t lied—this was no ordinary Pure Yang Grandmaster. Hei Fu had dismantled Leng Wuye’s mechanical arts, leaving him full of flaws.  

*A single sword suppressing a Pure Yang Grandmaster.*  

His conviction grew, and with it, the power of the *Three Origins Reverting Qi Art* surged.  

His combat strength soared.
