# Chapter 208: Yellow Mud City  

Xiao Ji followed his usual method to locate the Molten Valley.  

First, he went to the local government office to search through the extensive collection of official maps in the archives. If he couldn't find it there, he would head to the county city. And if even that failed, he would then visit the grand library in the Ancient City.  

In the archives of Willow Town, he did find records of Molten Valley. Within the Great Li Kingdom alone, there were as many as seventy places called Molten Valley. Including foreign territories, the number rose to three hundred and sixty-nine locations bearing the same name—some even turned out to be bathhouses.
