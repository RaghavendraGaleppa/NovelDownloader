## Chapter 69: Journey to the Main Peak

The night had been restless for many, but Sizi Zhiming didn't concern himself with that. Far away, the Hai Sha gang was also tossing and turning with excitement. Meanwhile, Xie Jia hurried back to their small quarters, her face flushed and her body trembling with excitement. She closed the door and leaned against it, still struggling to stand steadily.

Her companions, Jiang Yun and Zhong Jun, noticed her return. Jiang Yun, who had been sitting up, lay back down, turning her body away. Zhong Jun quickly got up, put on her shoes, and rushed to Xie Jia, grasping her hand.

"Xie Jia sister, what did the young master say?" Zhong Jun asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Her face turned bright red, and she started to fidget with her skirt.

Xie Jia playfully hit Zhong Jun on the forehead, her face still flushed. "What could he say, you silly girl?" 

Zhong Jun looked even more embarrassed. "Did he... did he find out?"

Xie Jia's boldness seemed to wane for a moment. "Sort of," she replied, her voice still trembling.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yun, who had been pretending not to listen, was actually paying close attention. Her ears turned visibly red.

Zhong Jun giggled and hugged Xie Jia's shoulder, planting a kiss on her cheek. "You have such a big heart, Xie Jia sister!"

The conversation was clearly a continuation of their discussions over the past few days. Jiang Yun remained neutral, not participating, supporting, opposing, or interfering.

Xie Jia teased Jiang Yun, saying, "The young master has understood our intentions, and he doesn't seem to mind. When he comes to favor you, we won't interfere."

The next day, Sizi Zhiming couldn't sleep, and by the time the sun was high, he got up, washed, and walked out of his quarters. He stretched his body, and his movements seemed effortless despite his lack of sleep.

At the entrance of the great hall, he encountered Han Li, who was taken aback by Sizi Zhiming's appearance. He was wearing a jade-white long robe with subtle cloud patterns that seemed to appear and disappear in the sunlight. This new look elevated his presence, making his features more defined and his aura more refined.

Han Li was momentarily stunned, then bowed her head and said nothing.

"Han Li," Sizi Zhiming said, his expression turning serious. "My master's belongings are ready – the letter, the map, and the 'Sheng Xian Ling'. When I meet the sect master, I'll mention this to him. You can go now. Your mother might be anxious, so don't delay."

Sizi Zhiming then turned to leave, saying, "No need to see me off; we're not formal like that."

Han Li nodded slightly and watched as Sizi Zhiming walked towards two horses waiting at the valley entrance. Jiang Yun and the other two women stood before him, their heights varying as they bowed in unison. The scene was picturesque.

Sizi Zhiming didn't look back, simply waved his hand, and mounted his horse. The three horses galloped down the mountain, leaving the valley behind.
