# Chapter 100: I Am So Disappointed in You!

The next morning, at the break of dawn, a faint light glowed in the east.

A faint, lingering fragrance remained by the empty bedside.

Although Li Mo was already accustomed to not seeing the "Ice Cube" every morning, he still silently estimated his progress in cultivation before getting up and going downstairs. Ying Bing was already waiting for him there.

Today, the hotpot restaurant had no landlady, but there was an extra graceful figure standing under the tree at the entrance.

Deep blue fish-tooth brocade cloth concealed her exquisite figure as she hugged her long sword. Through the light veil of her hanging gauze hat, blown by the wind, one could seemingly see her clear, tranquil eyes.

"Who is she?"

"Hiss, her legs are longer than my life."
"I wonder which great sect's female hero she is."
"I heard that the current chief disciple of the Qingyuan Sect is a woman with unparalleled beauty and formidable strength. Could it be..."

Wherever she appeared, she automatically became the center of attention.

"Let's go."

After a few seconds of eye contact, Li Mo spoke with a light laugh.

Entering the city against the morning wind, Little Li finally felt the immersion of being on a horseback in the jianghu.

Inside the prefectural city, carriages and horses flowed like a stream, and the people moved like smoke.

Li Mo thought that he hadn't visited Little Princess Jiang and the children for quite some time, so he prepared to buy some food to visit them.

"Candied hawthorns!"
"Are the white plums sweet? Sweet!"
"Family, I'm giving you all a福利 today. This foreign wine is originally eighty-eight taels, now it's eighty-eight wen..."
"Pack up all the candied hawthorns for me."
"Great Benefactor Li? Hahaha, Great Benefactor Li is eating my family's candied hawthorns!"

A vendor was ecstatic. He then took out a wooden sign and quickly wrote on it:

'Candied hawthorns, passionately recommended by Great Benefactor Li.'

The effect was immediate; many people became curious and came to watch and buy.

"Great Benefactor Li, eat mine!"
"Do you like eating roasted mountain herbs?"
"Great Benefactor Li, are you buying clothes? My family's women's clothing is very beautiful."
"Eh, where did he go?"

The scene became somewhat chaotic for a moment.

It took a while for Li Mo to squeeze out holding the bamboo pole with the candied hawthorns, even using the Wind Shadow Step.

"Great Benefactor Li?"

Ying Bing turned her head, not understanding why Li Mo was so famous in the prefectural city.

"It's a bit strange, but it's your fault."

"......."

After learning the whole story, Ying Bing slightly recalled, turned her gaze away, and gently pursed her red lips under her hanging gauze hat.

Soon, the two arrived at Mud Corner Alley.

Upon entering, the originally messy courtyard had been cleaned up. Although there were many miscellaneous items, it looked very tidy. The roof of the dilapidated house had been repaired, and a stove had even been built in the courtyard.

"Brother Li!"
"Stuttering Sister, look quickly, Brother Li is here!"
"Eh, who is that sister?"
"Wow, I've wanted to eat candied hawthorns for a long time."

The little beans immediately swarmed around them.

After a round of greetings, they found it strange. Stuttering Sister talked about him every day, so why didn't she come today?

Li Mo raised his eyes and caught a glimpse of a figure hiding by the door inside the room, only half of her head poking out. Her little face was flushed, and she didn't dare to come forward.

That appearance made Li Mo think of the socially anxious little cat he raised in his previous life. Whenever a stranger came to the house, it would hide.

Stranger?

Li Mo looked at the Ice Cube, a question mark popping up over his head.

You asked me to come find her, but you act like you're not very familiar with her?

What's going on?

Ying Bing looked at Jiang Chulong, seeing that her breathing was steady and her complexion was rosy despite her thinness, and couldn't help but soften her expression.

Li Mo tried waving to her:

"Chulong, I brought you something delicious."

"Mm..."

Jiang Chulong then walked out slightly nervously.

Although she was blindfolded, she could sense it.

That sister was not a bad person.

The small courtyard in Mud Corner Alley welcomed its head chef.

Li Mo tied on an apron and started preparing today's meal for the little beans.

Jiang Chulong quietly looked up at Ying Bing. Sensing the other was also looking at her, she quickly lowered her head again.

This sister was even more noble and dignified than the First, Second, and Third Matrons in the palace... Hmm, all of them.

Her aura is so powerful.

"Brother Li, I..."

"What is it?"

"It's nothing... I'll help you... cook..."

She skillfully took out the Chixiao Sword to help Li Mo.

Ying Bing took half a step forward, then withdrew it.

After a small half-hour.

Just as the food was almost ready.

"You two! Why are you here?!"

A voice full of frustration and disappointment suddenly came from the courtyard gate.

It was a youth in brocade clothes, holding two candied hawthorns in his hand.

*Plop—*

The candied hawthorn in his left hand fell to the ground.

"Luo Yu?"

Li Mo leaned back slightly. Why was this show-off here?

"I waited for you at the government office for a long time. Why didn't you come as agreed?"

"You're already in the prefectural city."

Luo Yu asked loudly, his words righteous and stern.

"Uh... I forgot."

Little Li remembered what he had forgotten.

Well, he never intended to act with Luo Yu and the others in the first place.

"You could forget something like this?"

Luo Yu's brow was already furrowed into a knot.

"You've been in the prefectural city, what have you been doing?"

"Running a hotpot restaurant."

Li Mo said seriously.

Hearing Li Mo's matter-of-fact tone, Luo Yu couldn't help but feel his blood surge.

So unreliable!

He then held a sliver of hope and looked at Ying Bing:

"And you?"

"Counting money."

Ying Bing didn't even look at him.

She didn't even know the name of this guy jumping up and down.

Who are you? We're not familiar.

Counting money? That means she's the landlady?

Luo Yu's vision went black, so angry he wanted to vomit blood.

The candied hawthorn in his right hand also rolled to the ground.

The Ziyang Prefecture is right at the foot of the Qingyuan Mountain. Aren't you concerned about the safety of the people? And you have the mood to run some lousy hotpot restaurant?

Are you here on official leave?!

"Hmph, I originally thought you two were somewhat notable figures, but now I am so disappointed in you!"

"And you, Miss Ying Bing, to think you would sink so low!"

Luo Yu stormed off in a huff, flicking his sleeves.

Li Mo held his forehead. "What is all this?"

Ying Bing shook her head gently, not understanding, and not very interested.

They had just picked up their bowls, ready to eat, when they saw Luo Yu, who had stormed out just moments ago, return.

Li Mo: "?"

"Uh, lend me two candied hawthorns." Luo Yu's face turned from green to white.

The ones he dropped earlier were the last two; he had managed to grab them with great difficulty.

"You like this stuff?"

Li Mo was both exasperated and amused. "Go ahead, take them."

"Hmph... my sister wants to eat..."

Luo Yu took two from the bundle of candied hawthorns left at the entrance.

Then he turned back and repeatedly emphasized:

"Don't think I'll forgive you just because of this. I'm still very disappointed in you."

He pointed at them with the candied hawthorns.

Just as he was about to walk out the gate, he paused, his eyes shifting between Li Mo and the little beans gathered around the dining table. Then he said sullenly:

"Lately, children have been disappearing frequently."

After leaving this sentence, he hurriedly left.

He certainly didn't come out specifically to buy candied hawthorns; he was out conducting investigations. He just hadn't found any clues yet.

Li Mo: ".....?"

"Children disappearing..."

Hearing these four words, Ying Bing fell into thought.

Li Mo looked at the little beans and asked:

"Have you seen any suspicious people nearby lately?"

"No, Brother Li."
"We're very clever. Kidnappers can't trick us."
"That's right, that's right."
"Mm, Stuttering Sister is very厉害. Even the big vicious dog at the alley entrance was beaten into submission by her. She'll protect us."

The little beans hurriedly assured him.

Li Mo, however, was thinking about whether he should just take them to the restaurant, where they could also help out a bit.

Uh... does this count as using child labor?

"Ahem!"

A cough came from outside.

It was Xiao Qin in disguise.

He looked serious now, surveying his surroundings.

When Li Mo came over, his first sentence was:

"Smiling Maitreya has sent a message."
