**Chapter 66: Blood Spirit Ancient Scroll**

Everyone was pondering the pros and cons.

Hu Jun’s proposal, at first listen, seemed quite appealing. As long as everyone pooled their efforts to cultivate a Foundation Establishment cultivator, then subsequent Foundation Establishment masters could be cultivated continuously, like a snowball rolling downhill.

However, if things were truly that simple, there would already be a huge number of Foundation Establishment cultivators in Myriad Immortals City.

After all, such an idea must have been thought of, and put into practice, long ago.

The burly middle-aged man shook his head, “How can we guarantee that your daughter, after successfully reaching Foundation Establishment, will continue to help us hunt monsters as per the promise? After all, we lack the means to restrain a Foundation Establishment cultivator!”

The old woman and the others all nodded. This was their biggest concern.

“Haha, this old man has long considered this matter!” Hu Jun let out two hearty laughs, then pulled an ancient scroll from his bosom.

“Is that the Blood Spirit Ancient Scroll?” As he slowly unrolled the scroll for everyone to see, the old woman’s expression instantly changed, and she exclaimed in surprise.

“Precisely. This is the Blood Spirit Ancient Scroll that this old man acquired at great cost. This scroll contains a Blood Spirit Pact. Once a Blood Spirit Pact is signed, even a Foundation Establishment cultivator cannot violate it!”

Hu Jun had clearly come prepared.

At this, the old woman, the burly middle-aged man, and the others all showed signs of being moved.

They were all familiar with the Blood Spirit Ancient Scroll; it was renowned in the cultivation world and possessed strong restrictive power even over Foundation Establishment cultivators.

With this ancient scroll, Hu Jun’s proposal no longer seemed unfeasible.

Even Lu Xu felt a bit swayed.

There were only nine people at this table, but the power they could bring forth was far more than just this handful.

The burly middle-aged man was the leader of a monster hunting group, the old woman came from a Qi Condensation family, Talisman Master Wang had extensive connections, and even Lu Xu, nominally a cultivator from a Qi Condensation family, was believed by everyone to be able to bring several late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators.

With so many people united, they could gather forty to fifty late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators, which would be an extremely formidable force.

Seeing everyone’s silence, Hu Jun increased his persuasion:

“This old man can bring in twelve late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators, two of whom, like myself, are at the tenth level of Qi Condensation!”

“Immortal Mo Qingchan has already agreed to join, and she can provide a set of Tier 1 High-grade formations!”

Mo Qingchan nodded, “This is a formation set treasured by our Mo family. Its power is immense and will absolutely not disappoint you all!”

She glanced around at everyone, took a deep breath, and said, “Besides providing this formation set, I can also promise you all one more thing! The Tier 2 spirit vein in Qinghu Market City will produce a Heavenly Spirit Flower in a hundred years. At that time, I am willing to include this Heavenly Spirit Flower into our alliance to help the descendants of my fellow daoists establish their foundations!”

It was clear that she was extremely eager to facilitate the formation of this alliance.

After all, for her, this was probably the only way to reach Foundation Establishment; there was no other method.

If even she failed to reach Foundation Establishment, then the Mo family of Qinghu would be erased from existence.

However, when everyone heard her words, they were somewhat dismissive. Mo Qingchan was clearly writing an an empty check.

There was still no definite conclusion as to whom the spirit vein in Qinghu Market City currently belonged.

Although everyone was in Myriad Immortals City, they were quite aware of the major affairs in Wei State. Mo Qingchan, solely on the name of being a descendant of the Mo family, could not obtain control of that spirit vein.

Even if she reached Foundation Establishment in the future, she would still need to defeat the Black Robe Society. Speaking such words, was she not trying to tie everyone to the war chariot against the Black Robe Society?

No one was willing to readily agree to such a matter.

Seeing everyone remaining silent, Hu Jun continued,

“If my fellow daoists agree, we can jointly purchase one to two more sets of Tier 1 High-grade formations. With dozens of late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators and two or three formations, will we still fear those monstrous beasts not being subdued?”

“Even Fellow Daoist Wen Siming and his group managed to successfully hunt a Tier 2 monster; how could we fail?”

“Perhaps we might even find Heavenly Spirit Flowers within the Tier 2 spirit veins where those monsters reside. Such things have happened before!”

Hu Jun was persuasive, and among the few present, several showed expressions of being moved, while others still looked solemn and undecided.

Seeing this, Hu Jun first looked at the old woman, “Madam Ming, what are your thoughts? If you miss this opportunity, decades later, if you wish to organize a monster hunting group for your grandson, it won’t have this scale!”

The old woman frowned, her mind filled with complex thoughts.

She naturally knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Although she also had some connections, if she were to organize a monster hunting group on her own, its scale would likely be inferior to Wen Siming’s.

Moreover, she couldn’t obtain something like a Blood Spirit Pact.

However, if she truly joined, her grandson would be ranked behind many others, and she was somewhat worried that if she died prematurely, whether the Foundation Establishment Pill would truly fall into her grandson’s hands would be hard to say.

But after long and hard deliberation, the old woman finally steeled her heart and made a decision.

She softly exhaled, nodded, and said, “This old woman will participate. For the sake of this old woman’s grandson, I shall risk my life!”

“Good! This old man believes Madam Ming will certainly not be disappointed!” Hu Jun was overjoyed.

Mo Qingchan and Hu Yan also showed a hint of a smile; they had finally secured a strong ally.

Hu Jun then looked at the burly middle-aged man, who shook his head, “Brother Hu, I previously participated in Fellow Daoist Wen’s monster hunting group and personally fought against a Tier 2 monster!”

“Regarding the strength of such monsters, I can only say they are not as easy to deal with as you imagine. Your plan might succeed, but many people might die in the process!”

Hu Jun was startled by these words, and then immediately asked, “So, Brother Lin, you are not planning to participate?”

The middle-aged man shook his head again, “No, I need to consider this matter carefully. I cannot give you an answer yet.”

Hu Jun was somewhat disappointed, but he wasn’t too disheartened.

Because he knew that since Brother Lin hadn’t directly refused, it meant there was still a good chance he would join.

The other party’s so-called careful consideration was likely to observe and see how strong an influence Hu Jun could gather before deciding whether to partner up.

Hu Jun had been planning this matter for many years, and he believed that the allies he would bring forth would definitely not disappoint any of those present.

Talisman Master Wang sat with narrowed eyes for a long while, then suddenly slapped the table, “This old man is in too!”

“Brother Wang? Excellent, excellent!” Hu Jun was pleasantly surprised, repeatedly praising him.

Talisman Master Wang sighed, “This old man has lived half his life idly, unwilling to take any risks, until I saw Fellow Daoist Wen risk his life in a breakthrough and die. Only then did I realize that if I continue this way, my descendants in the future will also have to fight to the death for a slim chance of survival, just like Fellow Daoist Wen!”

“We must secure a path for our descendants!” Talisman Master Wang said with a sigh.

“Brother Wang’s words resonate deeply with me!” Hu Jun also sighed with emotion. His painstaking efforts to recruit everyone were also, in essence, to help his daughter successfully reach Foundation Establishment.

“Brother Wang is right, I’m in too!”

“This old man also doesn’t want to miss such an opportunity!”

The other two tenth-level Qi Condensation cultivators present also made up their minds, their eyes gleaming.

Now, only Lu Xu had not expressed his stance. Everyone’s gazes turned towards Lu Xu.

“Fellow Daoist Han, what are your thoughts?” Mo Qingchan was the first to ask, a peculiar glint in her eyes.
