# Chapter 365: The So-Called Primordial Origin Sect

Xu Yunfan lowered his gaze to the紫金丹 (Purple-Gold Pill) in his palm, watching the lingering紫黑魔气 (purple-black demonic qi) dissipate. As his fingers tightened, the Ten Extremities True Qi, like a furnace, refined the energy into a pill etched with faint, flowing patterns.

Finally, Dugu Jiu understood the Truth Sect's desperate gamble. Bi Yuan had forcibly seized the Dragon Vein's玄黄气 (Xuanhuang Qi) through the Grand Rite of Martial Performance, enduring a siege just to push Xu Yunfan into the Land of Earthly Immortals—all to forge this Heavenly Sword capable of severing the末法 (Age of Dharma Decline).

Xu Yunfan was the Truth Sect's weapon against those域外天魔 (Foreign Heavenly Demons).

The legends spoke of Earthly Immortals who could截断江流 (cut off rivers) and削山峰 (slice mountains), yet before Xu Yunfan, such feats seemed as clumsy as a child swinging a hammer.

"Senior Dugu, let us go together."

Xu Yunfan took a step forward, the true qi around him pulsing slightly and causing the air to emit a dull rumble. "What lies within the Martial Exhibition Building should be far more interesting than this Heavenly Demon."

Dugu Jiu remained silent, waves of regret surging in his heart.

He watched Xu Yunfan's back, yet his feet involuntarily followed.

Right now, he truly wished to flee a thousand miles, to distance himself from this monster created by the Truth Sect.

If he hadn't taught Xu Yunfan the Ten Extremities Martial Way, which allowed the body to approach perfection, the latter's strength might have been significantly weaker.

"If I had known today would come, I never would have taught him the Ten Extremities Martial Way..."

Dugu Jiu sighed inwardly. He shouldn't have acted the high and mighty expert. He had assumed that even after acquiring the Ten Extremities Martial Way, it would take Xu Yunfan five or six years just to enter the gate. Yet, by their reunion, Xu Yunfan had already perfected the art.

Such speed was simply terrifying.

Who could have imagined that this young man would use the Ten Extremities Martial Way's concept of "Ten Thousand Laws Converging" as a foundation to innovate and create a wicked path that devours the true qi of others for his own use?

Such behavior was even more ruthless and overbearing than the great hegemons of the demonic path.

Xu Yunfan walked steadily ahead, completely unaware of the turbulent emotions churning in Dugu Jiu's heart.

Even if he had noticed, with his current state of mind, he wouldn't care in the slightest.

His mind was focused on contemplating the Martial Dao Heavenly Eye between his brows.

The Ten Extremities Martial Way was indeed profound, worthy of being called the pinnacle of martial arts, but it was far from his true trump card.

The attribute panel that appeared and disappeared in his vision according to his will was the fundamental basis for his dominance.

Any martial art he practiced would have its true meaning completely analyzed and absorbed by the panel's characteristics, turning it into his own martial foundation.

The Ten Extremities Martial Way merely saved him a few years of detours. Even without this technique, given time, he would still have reached the pinnacle.

"Immortal, spare me!!"

A shrill plea for mercy suddenly echoed from within the Purple-Gold Pill, interrupting Xu Yunfan's thoughts.

His heart stirred, and his fingers tightened abruptly. Cracks like a spiderweb instantly appeared on the pill's surface.

Just as he had suspected, this Foreign Heavenly Demon's so-called body was merely a shell. Its true essence was the very purple-black demonic qi that had just been refined into the pill.

"Senior Dugu, go on ahead. I will join you shortly."

After tossing out that line, Xu Yunfan's figure vanished abruptly before Dugu Jiu's eyes, causing the latter's pupils to contract violently.

Dugu Jiu felt a blur before his eyes. Xu Yunfan's silhouette dissipated like smoke, leaving not even a lingering echo before vanishing completely.

His pupils constricted, and he instinctively tensed the sword intent around his body, yet he couldn't capture even a single ripple of true qi. There was no sound of breaking wind, no trace of fluttering sleeves, not even a speck of dust at his feet was stirred.

Without raising the slightest commotion, not even a gentle breeze, he disappeared right before his eyes.

"This is... a movement technique of the Ten Extremities Martial Way? No, even the Truth Sect's most exquisite 'Shrinking the Earth to an Inch' movement technique should have some trace..."

He gripped the sword hilt unconsciously, his throat feeling dry.

The opponent's strength had far surpassed the scope of martial arts.

He looked toward the distant Martial Exhibition Building, his eyelids drooping slightly. After a few breaths of silence, he still followed Xu Yunfan's words and headed toward the building.

If he left now, who knows if Xu Yunfan would come after him when he returns? He didn't dare to take that risk.

"Who are you?"

"幽泉 (Youquan), this one is called Youquan, a disciple of the Hundred Desires Peak of the Primordial Origin Sect."

In an empty room within the imperial palace, listening to the voice vibrating from the Purple-Gold Pill in his hand, Xu Yunfan pondered for a moment and continued his interrogation.

Xu Yunfan's fingertips traced the demonic patterns flowing over the surface of the Purple-Gold Pill. As a massive amount of true qi gathered, the surface of the pill emitted a crisp cracking sound.

Inside the Purple-Gold Pill, Youquan's voice trembled so much it was almost distorted, as if choked by an invisible force: "Great One, please see clearly! This one is merely an outer disciple of the Hundred Desires Peak, sent to the Divine Martial World to collect some blood food..."

His tone suddenly turned piercing: "I was originally a good person!"

The demonic qi within the pill churned, and Youquan's voice turned venomous: "It's all the sin of the Primordial Demon Sect! I was originally a rustic villager, hoeing at sunrise and cooking at sunset. Who would have thought I would be captured by those demonic cultivators one day!"

His words were mixed with hissing demonic sounds, like the resonance of countless vengeful souls: "They used iron hooks to pierce my collarbones and forced me to swallow the Hundred Desires Demon Seed... Now that I'm in this state, I'm just trying to survive!"

Xu Yunfan sneered upon hearing this. There wasn't a single truthful word from this bastard's mouth. He abruptly contracted the pill in his palm, and Youquan let out a scream: "Spare me, Great One! I'll tell you everything! If the pill breaks, my soul will scatter for good!"

"You said Primordial Origin Sect, why is it called Primordial Demon Sect?"

Youquan gasped, his tone slightly embarrassed: "Primordial Origin Sect is what we call ourselves. In the Taihua Spirit Void World, everyone calls us the Primordial Demon Sect."

Xu Yunfan understood and continued: "What is the Hundred Desires Peak?"

Youquan explained while panting: "The Hundred Desires Peak is one of the Thirty-Six Unorthodox Peaks of the Primordial Origin Sect, specializing in cultivating the 'Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Method'..."

His voice grew quieter. He hesitated for a moment. Seeing that Xu Yunfan remained silent but merely increased the pressure of his true qi, he continued.

"The Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Method uses the extraction of the Seven Emotions and Six Desires of living beings as cultivation resources. The Peak Master is a Foundation Establishment Immortal, with hundreds of disciples under him, but tens of thousands of 'Dinglu' (Cauldrons)..."

A cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes: "Dinglu?"

"Th-that is, mortals with资质根骨 (aptitude and bone structure)..."

Youquan hurriedly said, "The Hundred Desires Peak sets up 'Joy Courts' in various worlds,表面上 (on the surface) teaching dual cultivation techniques, but in reality, secretly extracting the essence and qi of the Dinglu. Several hundred years ago, a junior brother, greedy for merit, refined an entire city of people into 'Desire Puppets,' but was discovered by the巡天使 (Patrol Envoy)..."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. Among these words, what he cared about most was the "several hundred years" mentioned by Youquan.

"You can live for hundreds of years?"

"Hundreds of years? No, we can't, heh..."

Youquan's voice twisted inside the Purple-Gold Pill, leaking a hint of bitterness: "Let alone hundreds of years, for us Qi Refining disciples, even two hundred years is a奢望 (luxury)!"

The demonic qi churned, as if recalling a terrifying event: "It's the Golden Core True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect who uses the 'World-Heaven Lock Lifespan Technique' to distort the flow of time. For us in this world, it can indeed accelerate the recovery of the spiritual qi nodes!"
