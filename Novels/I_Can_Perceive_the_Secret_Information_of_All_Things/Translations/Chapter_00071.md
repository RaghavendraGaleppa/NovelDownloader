# Chapter 71: First Experience of "Frostfinger"

The next day, eight miles outside Willow Town, at an unnamed small mountain.

"Taoist Master Xiao, why have we come outside the city?" Lin Musheng asked, confused about the situation.

"It's nothing too important," Xiao Ji replied. "You'll understand when we get there."

They entered the mountains.

In an area charred black by wildfire, a man stood upon a boulder.

"Wang Dafeng?" Lin Musheng's heart immediately panicked. He looked urgently at Xiao Ji. "Master, have you sold me out?"

The moment he said it, he dismissed his own words. If Taoist Master Xiao wanted to exchange him for reward money, there would be no need for such trouble or coming all this way—he could have simply had someone collect him from Yuanshen Temple.

Moreover, Xiao Ji had even obtained a Heart Sword technique manual for him and provided dedicated guidance. This made Lin Musheng even more unsettled, as he had no idea what would happen next.

"So it is you," Wang Dafeng said, his gaze greedy as he looked at Lin Musheng, then raised his head to the sky. "The almanac was right—today is auspicious for all matters. What fine weather."

Lin Musheng remained silent, standing still with his hand tightly gripping his sword. He knew that with his current abilities, he stood no chance of killing Wang Dafeng—he couldn't even hope to so much as graze the man's clothes.

The difference in strength was far too great.

This ruthless assassin was Third Uncle's most capable subordinate, wielding a hook specifically designed to sever heads. He took pleasure in watching blood spray from necks.

Xiao Ji observed Lin Musheng's tension and said, "Just to confirm—you do recognize him, right?"

"Absolutely," Lin Musheng nodded.

The spring mountain breeze carried a slight chill.

"The almanac never lies, but it does have its flaws," Xiao Ji remarked. "For example, if today is auspicious for all matters, and two people duel with only one surviving, would the deceased consider it an auspicious day or not?"

Wang Dafeng hadn't even bothered to look properly at Xiao Ji, but upon hearing the Taoist's strange words, he snorted coldly. "The dead don't count."

"Oh, if you explain it that way, it does make sense," Xiao Ji conceded. "So, for you, today holds no auspiciousness whatsoever."

"I hope you'll still be able to speak like this in a moment," Wang Dafeng sneered. He had no intention of sparing Lin Musheng—nor the Taoist. He planned to kill them both.

Xiao Ji ignored Wang Dafeng and turned to Lin Musheng. "If this man dies, you'll be able to live peacefully in Willow Town for a while—at least three years of peace and quiet."

"Even if trouble comes knocking, there's no need to worry. As I told you before... your safety is my responsibility."

Lin Musheng was no longer as tense.

Having someone powerful backing him up was reassuring—though it would be even better if it were free... He nodded at Xiao Ji. "Master's great kindness is beyond repayment."

"Just watch for now. The reason I arranged to meet here and had you come along is simply so you can witness this assassin's fate firsthand. That way, you won't be able to deny it later—no, I mean, so you'll fully understand the situation," Xiao Ji explained.

The atmosphere was oddly casual, lacking any sense of impending bloodshed.

After listening to their exchange, Wang Dafeng felt as though he was being ignored. He unhooked the head-taking sickle from his waist. "Let's see if this Taoist can even protect himself."

A murderous aura stirred the charred grass and branches nearby. A flash of cold light—the sickle was already at Xiao Ji's throat.

Wang Dafeng was indeed an experienced assassin. In such situations, most killers would target their primary mark first. Yet he chose to attack the outsider Taoist instead.

The move was sudden—Lin Musheng didn't even have time to react.

But Xiao Ji had already prepared.

At this moment, he raised two fingers of his right hand, their tips glowing with a chilling light, while a translucent layer of ice encased his body. With that simple motion, a shell of frost formed around him, stopping the sickle—which had claimed countless heads—dead in its tracks.

Wang Dafeng was stunned. His technique of beheading from a distance had been effortlessly blocked by a defensive barrier.

He tried to retract his weapon, but the sickle seemed glued to the icy shield, immovable.

Just as panic set in, Xiao Ji voluntarily dispelled the frost barrier. The ice around him shattered—and with it, the head-taking sickle.

Lin Musheng couldn't believe his eyes. The sickle was a decent magical artifact—he had personally witnessed Wang Dafeng using it in battle. While not a legendary weapon, it was certainly harder than ordinary metal.

How could it now be as brittle as thin ice?

Wang Dafeng was among the elite even among Qi Refinement cultivators, yet before Taoist Master Xiao, he seemed like a three-year-old caught misbehaving, his hands awkwardly fidgeting... Lin Musheng studied Wang Dafeng carefully and remarked, "Your artifact shattered like a pancake."

As if I couldn't see my own weapon being toyed with and destroyed... Wang Dafeng took a deep breath and glared at Lin Musheng. "I can see that. The young master has found himself quite the backer. Your luck is truly remarkable."

Lin Musheng's heart stirred. Had he faced Wang Dafeng today, he would have died in the first exchange—let alone be standing here speaking.

Yet Taoist Master Xiao handled it effortlessly, not only blocking the ambush but also shattering the enemy's weapon. This was the sheer dominance of superior cultivation.

Even so, it was hard to accept. Last time, Taoist Master Xiao had claimed to be at the Great Perfection stage of Qi Refinement, while Wang Dafeng was approaching the late stage.

"This is called Frostfinger," Xiao Ji said, raising his sword-fingers and aiming them at Wang Dafeng like a gun. "A newly learned technique—you're its first experiencer."

"I see," Wang Dafeng said, feigning composure. "Nothing special. Now witness my true power—take this!"

A fierce gust of wind swept past.

Lin Musheng stepped back several paces. When he looked again, Wang Dafeng was already fleeing into the distance.

Just as he was about to warn Xiao Ji—

A streak of cold light shot forth.

An extreme chill carved a white trail through the air.

The light struck Wang Dafeng mid-flight, instantly encasing him in a massive block of ice.

The frozen mass crashed to the ground.

Lin Musheng rushed over to check and called back to Xiao Ji, "Taoist Master Xiao, he's been frozen into an ice sculpture!"

Wang Dafeng had been instantly killed—without even a chance to fight back. The sheer disparity left no room for shock.

They weren't even in the same league.

Lin Musheng thought to himself, "Taoist Master Xiao claims to be at Great Perfection of Qi Refinement, but he must be hiding several realms beyond that."

With this threat eliminated, he truly felt today's weather was wonderful.

Then a question occurred to him, and he whispered to Xiao Ji, "Taoist Master Xiao... has my debt increased again?"

Xiao Ji shook his head. "Your memory is lacking. I told you the day we met—this one's free."
