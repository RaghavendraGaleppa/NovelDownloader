# Chapter 63: Sixth Level of Qi Refining, Peak Crystal Bone Realm

When Qi Chuan returned to his upper first-grade cave dwelling from the Alchemy Pavilion, he carried several large bundles of medicinal herbs and a handful of Gathering Essence Pills—enough to last him for some time.

Back in his cave, Qi Chuan first prepared the medicinal bath. As he soaked, his body gradually progressed from the initial stage of the Crystal Bone Realm toward its peak.

After the bath, Qi Chuan returned to the only stone chamber in his dwelling that was connected to an upper first-grade spiritual vein. He sat cross-legged on the bed, took out a Gathering Essence Pill, and swallowed it. Instantly, he felt a surge of potent medicinal energy spreading through his body.

Without delay, Qi Chuan closed his eyes and began circulating the Evergreen Art. Wisps of spiritual energy separated from the surrounding void, entering his body through his breath before being refined.

Soon, a full cycle was completed. When Qi Chuan opened his eyes, a line of text slowly appeared before him:

**[You circulated the Evergreen Art, absorbed spiritual energy, refined medicinal power, and converted it into your own mana. Triggered an 8x critical effect, gaining an 8x harvest. Your total mana has slightly increased.]**

Qi Chuan could clearly feel that the sliver of mana he had just refined had multiplied eightfold, now quietly flowing within his dantian in a fully refined state.

"With this pace, a breakthrough is only a matter of time," he murmured to himself before closing his eyes and resuming his cultivation.

Time flew by, and a year passed in the blink of an eye.

On this day, inside Qi Chuan's upper first-grade cave dwelling, his eyelids fluttered before slowly opening. As expected, a line of text appeared before him:

**[You circulated the Evergreen Art, absorbed spiritual energy, refined medicinal power, and converted it into your own mana. Triggered a 50x critical effect, gaining a 50x harvest. Your total mana has significantly increased. You have successfully advanced to the sixth level of Qi Refining.]**

Qi Chuan could feel the mana in his dantian expanding considerably, smoothly crossing the threshold from the fifth to the sixth level of Qi Refining.

"Finally, the sixth level!" A smile spread across his face as he sensed the "mana pool" in his dantian, now noticeably larger than before.

With this breakthrough, his mana reserves alone could overpower most cultivators at the fifth level of Qi Refining. It had been no easy feat.

"But my progress this year hasn't been limited to just mana..." Qi Chuan chuckled softly as he clenched his right fist. A dazzling crystalline glow emanated from within, spreading across his entire arm. If he willed it, the radiance could envelop his entire body.

"This power..." He could feel the terrifying force hidden within his fist—enough to crack even the finest mid-grade magical artifacts with a single punch, let alone shatter inferior ones.

Over the past year, by selling talismans to fund his body refinement, Qi Chuan had pushed the second layer of the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body—the Crystal Bone Realm—from its initial stage to its absolute peak. The next step would be the third layer.

Now, his physical body rivaled the toughest mid-grade magical artifacts. With pure physical strength alone, he could contend against peak sixth-level Qi Refining cultivators or top-tier first-grade mid-rank demonic beasts.

"Additionally, my Clear Cave Spirit Eyes have long reached the minor achievement stage. Unfortunately, my foundational elemental spells and talisman crafting haven't broken through yet..." A trace of regret flickered across Qi Chuan's face.

The Clear Cave Spirit Eyes had been relatively easier to cultivate, reaching minor achievement eight months prior—despite him not dedicating much effort to it. Had he focused more, the breakthrough would have come even sooner.

As for his foundational elemental spells, they had already surpassed the usual major achievement stage, though perfection still eluded him. If he had prioritized them, he might have reached the pinnacle sooner. However, Qi Chuan believed his cultivation base took precedence. Spells could wait.

After all, perfection was just one step away. Even with sporadic practice, he would eventually break through—possibly even before reaching the tenth level of Qi Refining, given how much ground remained.

Talisman crafting, however, proved more challenging. Advancing from an upper first-grade talisman master to a peak first-grade one was undeniably difficult. Though his skills had improved significantly within the upper-grade tier, Qi Chuan estimated that reaching the peak would still take considerable time.

---

That said, Qi Chuan remained confident in his talisman-crafting prowess. Upper first-grade talismans corresponded to the late stages of Qi Refining, making them formidable tools even among higher-level cultivators—much like his foundational elemental spells.

"Overall, despite not focusing intensely on any single skill, my progress has been remarkably swift. There's little to worry about," Qi Chuan mused.

"What truly matters now is my cultivation. At the sixth level of Qi Refining, one more step will take me into the late stages."

"And as the sect rules dictate, reaching late-stage Qi Refining before thirty allows me to remain in the inner sect until fifty."

"Moreover, if a true disciple position opens up and the sect holds a selection trial, the minimum requirement is the seventh level of Qi Refining."

"Meaning, one more breakthrough, and I'll qualify for the true disciple selection. Then, all I need is to wait for the trial to begin!"

At this thought, anticipation gleamed in Qi Chuan's eyes. With his diverse abilities, he stood a strong chance of securing a true disciple seat.

And once he became a true disciple, Foundation Establishment Pills would be within reach.

With his enhanced physique from the Minor Profound Crystal Jade Body, the pills, and his hundredfold critical effect ability, breaking through to Foundation Establishment should be relatively straightforward.

If there was one weakness, it lay in his soul strength.

The three major hurdles of Foundation Establishment were:  
1. **Mana**—reaching the tenth level of Qi Refining would suffice.  
2. **Physique**—the second layer of the Crystal Bone Realm already provided substantial support. The third layer would eliminate all concerns.  
3. **Soul**—this was the issue. Qi Chuan had never encountered any soul-refining techniques, neither in the Red Maple Valley Qi Clan nor within the Moonbreeze Sect's inner circle.

"Sigh... If only I could obtain a soul-refining technique," Qi Chuan murmured, shaking his head with a tinge of regret.
