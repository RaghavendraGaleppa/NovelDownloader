# Chapter 98: God Child

Zhou Tian looked at him speechlessly. This was just too tragic.

“You can’t blame me. It’s because the Holy God Church suddenly reconnected with their God Lord, who bestowed many trump cards upon them. Otherwise, I definitely would have escaped.”

Seeing Zhou Tian’s strange gaze, Zhang Yi forcefully explained, throwing all the blame onto the Holy God Church’s God Lord.

“How do you know they reconnected with their God Lord? And how are you so familiar with this place?” Zhou Tian asked, slightly surprised. Zhang Yi had been imprisoned here ever since arriving in the God-Forsaken Land. How could he know so much information? Even if the Pope had summoned a Holy Envoy phantom, it could just be an ancient trump card they still possessed, not necessarily proof of a connection with their God Lord.

And the detailed information about the Tribunal – the intelligence gathered by the Heavenly Qin did not include any of that.

Upon hearing Zhou Tian’s question, Zhang Yi looked at a nearby cell, and a clear voice came from within.

“I told him.”

A person walked out from the darkness of that cell. They wore tattered white robes, appearing young with rather fair skin and brilliant eyes, as if containing something mysterious.

Zhou Tian had thought there was no one in that cell because when he passed by just now, that was the only cell from which no one had emerged to observe him.

“Didn’t you say this place could seal sound?” Zhou Tian asked Zhang Yi beside him.

“Before meeting you, I also thought this place could truly trap anyone below the Great Emperor level,” Zhang Yi did not directly answer, but his meaning was clear.

“…” Zhou Tian rolled his eyes at Zhang Yi. How could that be the same?

“Can you tell me why you can ignore the seal on the cell?” the person’s voice came again.

“Then can you tell me why your voice can travel out?” Zhou Tian retorted.

“Sure,” the person said readily. “Because I am a god.”

“Is that so? What a coincidence, I am also a god,” Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow and said.

“I guessed as much.” Zhou Tian didn’t expect the person to show a 'just as I expected' expression.

“Is this guy’s brain fried?” Zhou Tian looked speechlessly at Zhang Yi beside him.

“No, he really seems to be a god,” Zhang Yi explained quite seriously.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Tian frowned slightly. A god? Would a god be trapped here?

“He has a tiny bit of divinity from an unknown source.”

“Divinity?!” Zhou Tian was somewhat astonished. He had seen the term 'divinity' in the information he gathered from Heavenly Qin. It was considered a specialty of this Divine Realm, an extremely unique power.

As is well known, every god in the Divine Realm has countless believers, and prayers come in constantly. Even a God System Lord would find it difficult to handle so many prayers, so divinity is the power that helps them process these prayers. This is just one of its functions; it has many other mysterious uses. Overall, it is incredibly powerful.

The source of such immense power is also extremely difficult to obtain. It must be refined from the power of faith, and the specific method is unknown to anyone. Even with detailed excavations of the rise of many divine systems by the people of Jiuzhou, not a single clue has been found.

“Are you saying he’s a Primeval God?” Zhou Tian looked at the person. Since the ancient gods fled, the God-Forsaken Land hadn't seen a Primeval God for many years.

“That I’m not quite sure about,” Zhang Yi shook his head. While divinity is difficult to obtain, it can be bestowed. Many divine systems are formed this way, with the God Lord being the source of all divinity.

“I am not a Primeval God.” The person had been silent, quietly listening to their conversation, but now spoke to deny it.

Zhou Tian and Zhang Yi turned their gazes to him, remaining silent, merely waiting for his explanation.

“I am a descendant of a god, named Anduin. Divine blood flows through my veins, naturally carrying a trace of divinity. That is why I can hear the prayers of believers here and thus learn many external messages. However, my divinity is too scarce, and coupled with the suppression of this place, I cannot respond to them.”

Anduin explained clearly, his voice calm and unhurried, possessing a serene aura. A golden glow shimmered in his hand. Even through two layers of railings and seals, Zhou Tian could feel the sanctity emanating from it. This was a manifestation of divinity, which Anduin used to corroborate his statement.

“A descendant of a god?” Zhou Tian pondered for a moment, then asked, “Who is your father?”

Anduin dispersed the glow in his hand, shaking his head with a smile. “My father was just an old farmer. I am not the direct child of that god; I can only be considered his descendant. For some unknown reason, divine blood awakened within me.”

“According to the believers who found me, I am a descendant of the Lord of Ash. I can also wield the Spear of Ash, which is the Lord of Ash’s weapon, so there should be no mistake.”

“Why are you speaking in such detail?” Zhou Tian did not ask who the Lord of Ash was but instead asked another question, because Anduin was simply too honest, answering whatever he was asked and explaining everything clearly.

“I naturally have my purpose…” Before Anduin could finish his sentence, he suddenly frowned and said to Zhou Tian, “Go back quickly, the Tribunal’s gates have opened again.”

Zhou Tian was momentarily stunned but didn't hesitate. He exited Zhang Yi’s cell and returned to his own. Anduin had no reason to deceive him about such a small matter.

*Thump! Thump!*

The sound of an energy construct stepping on the floor came, gradually approaching. A ten-foot-tall armored figure approached, carrying a person, also in armor, but it was tattered.

Where it passed, flames rose from the cells, and various grotesque creatures stretched out their arms towards the energy construct, baring fangs and claws, seemingly wanting to say something. Most likely, they wanted to report Zhou Tian, but unfortunately, this energy construct had long lost the sentience it possessed in ancient times; it merely walked forward with the person in its hand.

As it drew closer, Zhou Tian finally saw clearly the person it was carrying.

“Mu Su?!”

Zhou Tian cried out in surprise. The person in the energy construct’s hand was none other than his new companion, Mu Su, who had lost his usual dashing appearance from previous days.

As it passed Zhou Tian’s cell, Mu Su clearly saw him, and his pale face immediately flushed crimson, his eyes wide as lightbulbs. His mouth opened and closed, but Zhou Tian could not hear any sound, though it was likely he was cursing him.

*Crackling!*

A burst of electrical arcs surged. Runes on the energy construct’s broad metal hand lit up, and lightning coursed over Mu Su’s body. It appeared to be punishing him.

Mu Su trembled uncontrollably, no longer speaking, only glaring fiercely at Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian awkwardly rubbed his nose. *This can’t be my fault, can it? You cursed me.*
