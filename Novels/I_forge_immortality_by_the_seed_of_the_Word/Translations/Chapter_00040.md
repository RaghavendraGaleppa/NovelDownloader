# Chapter 40: The Azure Void Profound Heaven (Bonus Chapter)

At the top floor of the Heritage Pavilion, over a dozen figures clad in purple robes sat in solemn silence, their auras vast and profound like an endless abyss. Beneath them seemed to stretch a void of starry darkness, where countless legacies floated amidst chilling or scorching waves of terrifying power.

Suddenly, a hunched figure gradually materialized at the forefront, its form shifting between that of an infant, a youth, and an elder in a bizarre, ceaseless cycle.

"Greetings, Pavilion Master!" the purple-robed figures rose and bowed in unison.

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly before asking, "Do you know why I've summoned you all today?"

His voice resonated through the space like the simultaneous speech of a child, young man, and old man, causing the entire Heritage Pavilion to tremble momentarily.

"Might it concern the opening of the Azure Void Profound Heaven to receive chosen seeds from the lower realms?" asked the foremost purple-robed figure.

"Indeed. The Azure Void Profound Heaven will open in five years to receive legacy seeds from the lower realms, following the usual protocol—selection through the Radiance Wall's True Spirit Ranking. For most of you, this is your only opportunity."

"Foundation Establishment grants three hundred years of life, while the Azure Void Profound Heaven opens only once every one hundred and eighty years! Missing this chance means being forced, like us, to break through to the Golden Core Divine Ability realm in the lower realms, forever cutting off the path to immortality."

The Pavilion Master sighed deeply.

"Pavilion Master, ascending the True Spirit Ranking is no easy feat," said Senior Brother Liu from below, his voice tinged with bitterness. 

"The Crimson Crow region of the Central Heaven Domain spans over thirteen hundred nations with as many Dao Academies. The strong are as numerous as stars, yet the True Spirit Ranking only has eighteen hundred seats. Among all our Dragon Lake Academy's inner courts, only the chiefs of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion and Spirit Dao Pavilion have made the list."

"Therefore, in eighteen months, Dragon Lake will collaborate with Divine Thunder and Mystic Light Academies to open the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven. All manner of legacies and Dao insights will be provided to give you one final push! Succeed, and immortality awaits; fail, and fate is sealed!"

"My late notice is due to urgent matters with the Academy Master. The inner court disciples of Thousand Techniques Pavilion have likely been in seclusion for months preparing for the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven. Don't delay. Additionally, outer court disciples under forty with Qi Refinement tenth level cultivation will also enter this time."

"One hundred eighty-five years from now, they might bring unexpected surprises to Dragon Lake."

The Pavilion Master's words plunged the assembled inner court members into silence.

One day later, on Panlong Island.

A rugged-looking man stood with hands behind his back, his stern gaze fixed on Chen Xiandao standing quietly before him.

"Junior Brother Chen, is this our first meeting?" he asked, his deep voice resonating.

Chen Xiandao replied calmly, "This is indeed my first time standing before our team leader since joining Panlong Squad. Chen Xiandao greets Senior Brother Jia."

Despite facing a tenth-level Qi Refinement expert, Chen Xiandao showed no fear. Instead, his eyes blazed with confidence as a giant phantom manifested behind him, surrounded by crimson divine flames.

"Excellent!" Senior Brother Jia exclaimed approvingly.

"Senior Brother surely didn't seek me out just for introductions," Chen Xiandao said with a faint smile.

"Indeed," Senior Brother Jia's expression turned serious. "The inner court issued orders yesterday to increase resource allocation for your cultivation. Our goal is to reach tenth-level Qi Refinement within eighteen months."

"Eighteen months? Tenth level?" Chen Xiandao murmured.

"From today, Panlong Squad will provide you unlimited high-grade spirit pills. Any cultivation questions can be directed to me. Do you have the confidence?"

The air grew still as Senior Brother Jia's intense gaze locked onto Chen Xiandao's eyes.

After a long pause, Chen Xiandao laughed heartily. "Eighteen months is more than enough! If I can't reach tenth level with such support, I'd be ashamed to remain in the academy."

"Good. I'll have others handle your annual missions—focus solely on cultivation," Senior Brother Jia instructed.

Unexpectedly, determination flashed in Chen Xiandao's eyes. "Please don't say that, Senior Brother. Missions are valuable training opportunities I cannot miss. Moreover, I've already accepted one before your arrival."

"What?" Senior Brother Jia's eyes widened. "You just reached fourth level barely half a month ago, and you're taking missions alone? For your first assignment?"

"I'm fully prepared. I depart tomorrow."

"What mission? Where?"

"Demon extermination—Langya Prefecture, Yun Province."

Senior Brother Jia relaxed slightly. "That's manageable. Many outer court squads have taken it, including one of our vice-captains. Remember—higher demons are handled by senior Qi Refinement disciples. Stay within bounds, and you'll be safe."

"Just find demons matching your level to practice on."

"I'll remember your guidance," Chen Xiandao said with a smile.

"Before leaving, collect enough high-grade spirit pills from the Merit Hall. Your cultivation can't afford delays."

"Understood."

With that, Senior Brother Jia transformed into a streak of light and vanished.

Meanwhile, in Mistglow Squad, a similar scene unfolded.

"Junior Sister, tomorrow I'll take you to Langya Prefecture for your first real demon encounter while completing this year's mission swiftly."

"Also, collect two—no, three bottles of Green Sprout Spirit Nourishing Pills from the Merit Hall for cultivation during the mission. Not a moment can be wasted!"

"Thank you, Senior Sister Nan Shu."

"Don't mention it."

Elsewhere, outside Zhang Jing's residence, a graceful figure stood waiting.

As the bronze gate opened, Zhang Jing appeared.

"Junior Brother, we meet again!" Tong Yao greeted with a bright smile.

"I see you've selected a mission?" Zhang Jing asked.

"Indeed! Following Senior Brother Yang Chu's instructions, Senior Brother Ding and two others spent considerable time choosing the right one."

Tong Yao handed Zhang Jing three talismans.

"What are these for?" Zhang Jing examined them curiously.

"Every mission requires preparation," Tong Yao explained. "These are for emergencies or special circumstances—activated instantly with spiritual sense."

"Considering it's your first mission, we prepared these for you. But use them wisely!"

Touched, Zhang Jing looked down at the three ordinary low-grade talismans—two Golden Armor and one Wind Blade.

"Thank you, Senior Sister!" he said sincerely. Though insignificant to his current strength, he appreciated the gesture.

"Don't mention it! I told you I'd watch out for you," Tong Yao waved dismissively.

"By the way, what's our mission?"

"Demon extermination, of course!"
