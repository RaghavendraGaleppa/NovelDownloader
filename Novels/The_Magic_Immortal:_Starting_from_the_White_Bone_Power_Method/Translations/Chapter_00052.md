# Chapter 52: The Black Market  

Wang Chan's first experience with the black market was far from ideal.  

The hefty entrance fee could have bought him a jug of low-grade spirit wine in the elegant chambers of Xiuzhao Tower's third floor in the Little Black River Market, along with two graceful courtesans to keep him company for three days and nights.  

He had imagined the black market—a gathering place for elite cultivators—to be at least understated yet luxurious, if not outright high-class.  

Yet, after passing through a long, dark tunnel, he found himself in a desolate valley.  

Scattered around were a few withered trees on the verge of decay, with sparse patches of pale, lifeless grass. Not a single trace of green could be seen.  

Taking a deep breath, he noticed the thin spiritual energy—even sparser than in the barren valley beneath Lotus Mountain. A faint, unpleasant odor lingered in the air, though he couldn't quite place its origin.  

Above the valley stretched a pitch-black dome, likely the manifestation of the market's protective formation. Its ancient, imposing aura suggested it was at least a second-tier formation—far beyond the first-tier, given the oppressive pressure it exuded.  

If any troublemakers dared cause a ruckus here, they'd be trapped like turtles in a jar—no chance of escape. That, at least, was reassuring.  

But what truly irked Wang Chan was the atmosphere.  

The vast valley was filled with stalls, thatched huts, wooden pavilions, and stone palaces, all arranged in a seemingly profound pattern. Yet, the market's overseers had inexplicably adorned the place with countless pale luminous stones, casting an eerie glow that made the entire scene resemble the underworld.  

Despite the steady stream of cultivators coming and going, the place lacked the lively bustle of the Little Black River Market. Most remained silent, their cold eyes warning strangers to keep their distance.  

Many cultivators sported bizarre outfits—wide-brimmed hats, cloaks, masks, black robes, capes, ghostly armor, animal pelts—each more outlandish than the last.  

Wang Chan was genuinely impressed by the sheer variety.  

After spending half an hour familiarizing himself with the surroundings, he passed by a stall run by a woman in a floral dress and a deer mask. Her aura marked her as a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator.  

Wang Chan glanced at her, noting the rustic dress—plain cloth, not a spirit garment—that clashed with her slender figure.  

Then it struck him—wasn’t she the same woman who had stared at him intently before retreating a hundred paces on the road here?  

---  

Noticing his gaze, the woman looked up and froze momentarily before saying, "Take your pick."  

Her voice was unexpectedly pleasant—refined and magnetic, reminiscent of the intellectual women from his past life.  

Wang Chan crouched down to inspect her talismans.  

Five types were on display: three common low-grade talismans available at the Little Black River Market, and two mid-grade ones he hadn't seen before—**Mid-Grade Earth Prison Talisman** and **Mid-Grade Shadow Veil Talisman**.  

The former summoned an earthen prison for defense or trapping enemies, boasting superior durability due to its earth-attribute nature. The latter created a spiritual barrier to block prying eyes.  

Both were must-haves for travel or... less savory activities.  

"Do you have a Mid-Grade Soul Suppression Talisman?" Wang Chan asked casually after a moment.  

The woman blinked, then shook her head slowly.  

"How about a Mid-Grade Diamond Talisman?"  

Another shake.  

"Surely you have a Mid-Grade Lightning Sword Talisman?"  

She gave him a long look before shaking her head again.  

"Your selection is lacking," Wang Chan sighed. "Fine, how much for the Earth Prison and Shadow Veil Talismans?"  

"One hundred fifty spirit coins for the 36-layer Earth Prison Talisman. Ninety for the 19-layer Shadow Veil Talisman."  

"Too expensive."  

"How many do you want?"  

---  

Later, Wang Chan found a wooden teahouse and paid twenty spirit coins for a private room on the second floor.  

For the next hour, the room was his, complete with a pot of low-grade spirit tea. Unlike ordinary teahouses, this one had a low-grade concealment formation, ensuring privacy for... discreet activities.  

The entire building was also shielded by a mid-grade formation, offering decent security.  

A similar setup in the Little Black River Market would cost only ten spirit coins, but he had no choice—he couldn't exactly sort through his loot in public.  

Doing so would invite trouble within moments, as envious cultivators would undoubtedly ignore the black market's rules and attack him outright.  

After inspecting the room, Wang Chan calmly activated a **Mid-Grade Shadow Veil Talisman**, creating a hazy barrier around himself.  

Then, with a deep breath, he tapped his storage pouch, releasing a series of glowing objects onto the table.  

- A black scissors (low-grade, 24-layer restrictions).  
- A Water-Avoiding Shuttle (mid-grade, 48-layer restrictions).  
- A silver bracelet (mid-grade, 36-layer restrictions).  
- A Ninefold Darkwater Formation set (low-grade, with a formation disk and nine flags, 27-layer restrictions).  
- A black spirit robe (low-grade, 11-layer restrictions).  
- A mysterious nail of unknown use (low-grade, 18-layer restrictions).  

The loot was plentiful, and the restrictions complex. After a quick mental calculation, Wang Chan's eyebrows rose slightly, and the corners of his lips twitched upward. But he suppressed his excitement, muttering, "Decent, I suppose."  

If sold, these items would fetch around twenty thousand spirit coins after deductions.  

The Water-Avoiding Shuttle alone—capable of both water遁 and defense—was a rare dual-purpose artifact worth nearly ten thousand.  

A worthy reward for his desperate battle.  

Next, he retrieved the black-robed cultivator's storage pouch. He hadn't had time to inspect it earlier during his hurried escape.  

The pouch was black, bearing an intricate floral insignia, and of higher quality than the one at his waist.  

Given the value of the Water-Avoiding Shuttle, scissors, robe, and nail—all from the black-robed man—Wang Chan's eyes gleamed with anticipation.  

If the man's combat gear was this valuable, what treasures lay hidden inside?  

Brute-forcing the pouch's restrictions, Wang Chan poured its contents out.  

Moments later, his excitement waned.  

Despite the pouch's size, the haul was disappointing—a few mid-grade talismans, a dozen low-grade ones, and a worn low-grade robe, worth maybe three hundred spirit coins at most.  

Seventy-odd spirit coins were barely worth mentioning.  

The only notable items were two tokens.  

One was an unremarkable black iron plate engraved with the number **96**. Though its purpose was unclear, the digits appealed to Wang Chan, so he set it aside.  

The other was an identity token from the Zhou family, a prominent Foundation Establishment clan in the White Mountain region. The black-robed man, Zhou Zhixuan, was actually a direct descendant.  

"Some descendant," Wang Chan scoffed. "Not a single treasure to his name."  

His earlier battle had cost him hundreds of spirit coins in talismans, and this was the meager return?  

"Not all efforts yield rich rewards," he sighed, turning to the white-robed woman's storage pouch with lowered expectations.  

To his mild surprise, this one held better loot—though nothing matched the Water-Avoiding Shuttle, it was still a consolation.  

No mid-grade artifacts, but three low-grade robes, two low-grade artifacts (a black fan and a silver bowl), plus:  

- Three mid-grade Golden Armor Talismans.  
- Two mid-grade Earthwalk Talismans.  
- One mid-grade Windwalk Talisman.  
- Four mid-grade Protection Talismans.  
- Over twenty low-grade talismans.  

Not a single spirit coin, though.  

"Did she just mooch off the black-robed man?" Wang Chan chuckled.  

The woman—his "auntie"—was clearly thrifty and shrewd.  

After stashing the talismans, he examined the robes. They were stylish and nearly new, so he kept them (though he refrained from sniffing them—he wasn't *that* weird).  

The fan, despite its imposing name (**Black Miasma Fan**), had only three restrictions—likely just for cooling off on hot days.  

Disappointed, he picked up the silver bowl and probed it with his spiritual sense.  

His hand jerked in shock.  

Inside the bowl lay a meticulously stacked pile of gleaming spirit coins.  

Holding his breath, he counted carefully.  

**Thirty thousand.**  

Not one more, not one less.
