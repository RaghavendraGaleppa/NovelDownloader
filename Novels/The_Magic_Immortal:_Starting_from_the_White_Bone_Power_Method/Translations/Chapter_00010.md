# Chapter 10: The Black River Market  

No sooner had Wang Chan stepped outside than screams erupted all around. He hastily retreated back to his doorway.  

"What formidable Wind Chill Technique! Well played, well played! This Yu fellow has eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. Losing this arm is my own fault. From this day forth, the Red Leaf Gang shall retreat at the mere sight of Fellow Daoist Chen!"  

With those words, a flurry of hurried footsteps faded into the distance down the mountain.  

A top-grade magical artifact!  

The Red Leaf Gang!  

A man surnamed Yu...  

"Could that be Deputy Gang Leader Yu, the late-stage Qi Refining cultivator?"  

Wang Chan stood frozen at his door, not daring to move a muscle. Only when the footsteps had completely vanished did he cautiously peer toward courtyard number seventy—and immediately jumped in fright.  

There, atop the courtyard wall, stood Fellow Daoist Chen, clad in white robes and a black skirt, her silver-highlighted ponytail fluttering in the wind. Bathed in sunlight, she cut a dashing figure, her silver ponytail lending her an air of extraordinary grace—so much so that Wang Chan felt an inexplicable urge to grab it.  

Sensing his presence, Chen shifted her gaze from the mountain path to him.  

The pressure she exuded at that moment was overwhelming. Wang Chan couldn't meet her eyes and instinctively shrank back behind his door.  

After a glance at his courtyard, now littered with filth, she frowned and called out to him, "Hey, do you know how to clean?"  

Wang Chan blinked, momentarily taken aback by her bluntness.  

What?  

You want me to clean it?  

You don’t know how?  

You’re the one who made the mess, yet you’re ordering me to clean it up?  

Who do you think I am?  

I, Wang Chan, may not be strong enough to fight you now, but I still have my pride! How could I cower under your tyranny, at your beck and call?  

"No—"  

Whoosh!  

A gust of wind brushed past him. Before he could react, something lightly tapped his chest. Looking down, he found a pristine white spirit coin stuck to his robe, exuding a faint osmanthus fragrance.  

Ah...  

Wang Chan's eyes gleamed as he pressed the coin to his chest and strode forward enthusiastically. "No problem! Cleaning is my specialty! Would you like your courtyard cleaned too, Fellow Daoist Chen? Since I’m free anyway, one courtyard or two makes little difference."  

Swish!  

Another coin flew toward him, along with the simple token for courtyard seventy.  

With the two coins and token in hand, Wang Chan watched as Chen leaped down from the wall and disappeared into her residence.  

"Sure, Fellow Daoist Chen is ruthless, aloof, and downright rude, but she pays—and with clean coins at that. Not only are they untainted, they even smell nice."  

---  

Clutching the two coins, Wang Chan couldn’t suppress a grin. This was equivalent to what he’d earn after ten days to half a month of medical practice.  

So what if he had to clean two courtyards?  

Making money was nothing to be ashamed of.  

---  

The best route to the Black River Market was along the river opposite Lotus Mountain. Having traveled it countless times before, Wang Chan could walk it blindfolded.  

Originally, there had been no path along the riverbanks, but with enough foot traffic, one had naturally formed.  

As he walked, he kept a protective barrier around himself, talismans tucked in his sleeves, needles concealed in his fist, eyes scanning the road ahead, and spiritual sense probing his surroundings.  

At the slightest hint of spiritual energy or movement, he would pause to assess before proceeding.  

When encountering other cultivators, he subtly distanced himself. If they were acquaintances, he’d exchange a distant salute; if not, he kept them in his peripheral vision, wary of sudden attacks.  

The previous day’s encounter still haunted him—there was no such thing as being too cautious.  

"All fear stems from insufficient firepower. If I were as strong as Fellow Daoist Chen, I could swagger around without a care."  

The thought had barely crossed his mind when the thunder of hooves erupted behind him. Thanks to his vigilance, he leaped aside just in time to avoid being trampled.  

Instinctively, he prepared to retaliate with his needles.  

Then, a scorching gust of wind blasted past his face.  

A few paces ahead, a white stallion with hooves wreathed in crimson flames galloped by, carrying a mid-stage Qi Refining male cultivator in luxurious robes and an early-stage female cultivator with ample curves. The pair seemed too engrossed in each other to notice him.  

"Damn! Riding backward and cracking the whip—creative."  

Wang Chan retracted his needles with a scoff.  

The horse was a mid-grade Blaze Steed, worth at least a thousand spirit coins—far beyond the means of an average rogue cultivator.  

As for the robed cultivator, not only was he mid-stage Qi Refining, but his status was likely notable too. Swallowing his anger was the only option for now.  

Still, thanks to the backward riding, Wang Chan had a clear view of the man’s ugly mug and the woman’s striking silhouette.  

If fate brought them together again, he’d be sure to repay the favor.  

"Someday, when I make it big, I’ll get myself a steed like that—one woman in front, one behind, just for the thrill of it."  

Taking a deep breath, Wang Chan pressed on, his mind wandering.  

---  

He had barely taken a dozen steps when a shadow loomed overhead. Looking up, he spotted a silver flying vessel tearing through the sky toward the Black River Market.  

Watching it vanish into the distance, Wang Chan’s envy flared. Suddenly, the Blaze Steed lost its appeal. A flying vessel was the way to go—imposing in appearance, spacious inside, capable of carrying a dozen beauties for airborne revelry.  

Further along, scattered clusters of crude dwellings dotted the landscape, housing rogue cultivators who couldn’t afford mountain caves.  

Compared to them, Wang Chan realized he wasn’t doing too badly—at least he had a medical trade to sustain himself and a rented cave for cultivation.  

Half an hour later, rounding a mountain bend, the view opened up.  

Five peaks stood in the distance, splitting the Black River into five tributaries that surged onward.  

To the left, a vast riverside plain merged into a sprawling valley. Above both, a translucent dome shimmered like an inverted bowl, its surface rippling with runes. Beneath it lay the Black River Market—the only trading hub for cultivators within a thousand li.  

Outside the market, the silver flying vessel he’d seen earlier was parked on the grass, now guarded by a squad of white-armored sentries standing rigidly at attention.  

In the past, these guards had lazed about in a nearby pavilion, sipping tea and chatting. Their current vigilance was unusual.  

After paying three spirit pearls at the entrance, Wang Chan stepped into the market.  

Instantly, a cacophony of voices, a medley of scents, and a vibrant tapestry of life assaulted his senses, reminding him of the bustling country fairs from his past life.  

Thanks to the management of the Enforcement Hall, the market was lively yet orderly, divided into distinct sections.  

Instead of heading straight to the medical area, Wang Chan made for the supplies district.  

---  

"Fresh Red-Tusk Spirit Rice! Soft, sticky, and sweet! One spirit coin for ten pounds—what? Fifteen pounds for one coin? Are you robbing me?!"  

"Ha! This old man’s skills are crude, but I got lucky with this Black-Crested Serpent. How about some snake meat for thirty spirit pearls? Throw in a jar of snake blood, and you’ll be vigorous all night!"  

"If you’re not buying, don’t touch! These Jade Spirit Fruits each bear ten spirit veins—one coin per pound, no bargaining!"  

"You want tender Three-Colored Pheasant? At that age, none are tender! No juicy fowl here, but if it’s moisture you’re after, try the Red Blossom Pavilion—their Lady Red Hairpin might..."  

"Oh, Fellow Daoist Wang! It’s been days! That green robe suits you so well... Care for some braised Three-Horned Mutton? On the house—oh, and how about some... ahem... lamb’s treasures? No need for payment—after your ‘cloud-pushing’ last time, I’ve been feeling so much lighter..."  

---  

Within two incense sticks’ time, Wang Chan emerged from the crowd, five spirit coins lighter and wincing at the expense.  

Still, these were necessities—without them, daily life would be unbearable.  

He’d bought enough supplies for two months.  

After all, with food stocked at home, one could face the world without fear.  

With his remaining coins, he headed for the more refined district of shops and pavilions. Unlike the open-air stalls, this area was clean and orderly, frequented by well-dressed cultivators.  

Here, one could find low-grade talismans, pills, artifacts, and materials—though raw materials dominated.  

Soon, he stopped before a two-story building with a plaque reading "Hundred Herb Garden"—his usual source for Spirit Nourishing Elixir.  

"I wonder if they sell demon bones."  

With that thought, he stepped inside.
