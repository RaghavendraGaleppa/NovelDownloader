## Chapter 18: Divine Blade Cave, Murong Xiao Possessed by Killing Intent

In front of Divine Blade Cave.

Looking from the entrance, various weapons were displayed inside, some glinting with cold light, others covered in rust. A palpable aura of blades assailed one's face, causing the body to tense up.

Numerous powerful cultivators moved in and out of the cave. Some were blacksmiths, while others were inner disciples from different peaks.

“What is your purpose in entering Divine Blade Cave, and how long will you stay?” An inner disciple attendant sat there, recording those entering and exiting.

However, when he looked up, he was slightly taken aback. The young man before him was too young.

Li Mo replied, “Body tempering and cultivation, at most two hours.”

The attendant was stunned for a moment, then waved his hand impatiently. “You’ve only just entered the Qi-Blood Realm. What are you doing here? Go, go, go.” With his Observation Realm eyesight, he could tell at a glance that Li Mo had only recently entered the Qi-Blood Realm.

“Elder Hanhe has already granted permission.” Li Mo didn't mind the other party's attitude. Though he was a bit fierce, he didn't seem to have any ill intentions.

“Elder Hanhe...” The attendant became uncertain and surprised. “Which peak are you from?” he asked.

Li Mo: “Jade Peak.”

“Jade Peak doesn't have any disciples...” Mid-sentence, the inner disciple attendant suddenly remembered that Elder Shangwu had indeed taken a true disciple this year. Moreover, one with exceptional talent. Right, it seemed he had ascended the Stairway to Heaven alongside the sect master's true disciple, Ying Bing. What was his name again... For a moment, he genuinely couldn't recall.

“Please record my waist token.” Li Mo removed his waist token.

After recording it, the attendant nodded and, with a softened attitude, began to explain: “If you are going to cultivate, remember to act within your capabilities. The first floor holds sharp instruments, many of which have never seen blood. As for the second floor, those are true deadly weapons. Haha, I once slew a notorious bandit, and his saber is now on the second floor.” Since the other party was a true disciple, he might have some special reliance. For example, Elder Hanhe's newly accepted true disciple possessed an incredibly powerful physique and could already descend to the second floor. He was happy to offer a couple more explanations.

“What about the third floor?” Li Mo asked curiously.

“Young man, don't be too ambitious. The third floor stores renowned artifacts, and these artifacts possess spirits. You wouldn't dare go there until you reach the Observation Realm.” The attendant shook his head, emphasizing again.

“I understand.” Li Mo retrieved his waist token, cupped his hands in a salute, and walked into the cave.

Instantly, the sensation of being pricked by countless needles grew even stronger.

There were many people on this floor, and some recognized him. “Li Mo?”

“Ho, it really is True Disciple Li.”

“What's he doing here? Cultivating?”

“Hiss... so fair-skinned and tender, he doesn't look like he has a body-tempering foundation. And he hasn't reached the Inner Breath Realm yet, so he shouldn't need metallic energy to refine his inner breath, right?” Everyone was puzzled.

But Li Mo clearly had no intention of explaining to others; he walked forward fifty steps as if no one else was there.

“Phew... I can't go any further.” Li Mo let out a long breath. By this point, his skin had already begun to prickle with pain. On his own, fifty steps into the first floor was already his limit. If he tried to go further, his body would suffer irreversible damage.

“Ten years of martial arts insight remaining,” he thought. “Let's first get started with the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body.” Li Mo braced himself, a thought stirring in his mind.

【Ten years of martial arts insight successfully injected.】
【Year 1: You diligently studied the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body, learning how to control the sharp, weapon-killing aura to temper your body.】
【Year 3: After deeper practice, you discovered that if controlled properly, you could even temper your internal organs.】
【Year 5: Your Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body reached initial mastery.】
【Year 10: Your control became exquisite, allowing you to subtly resonate with various weapons and temper your meridians.】
【Insight complete.】
【You have comprehended the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body to Great Accomplishment!】

Instant enlightenment. Li Mo immediately perceived a new world. If the pervasive sharp, weapon-killing aura was likened to water, then before, he was a landlubber. If the water became deep, he would drown even in calm weather. Mastering the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body to Great Accomplishment made him a wave-rider; unless it was a massive storm, nothing could harm him.

“Body tempering!” Li Mo sat cross-legged. The sharp, weapon-killing aura surrounding him was drawn into his body. The sharp aura was dangerous, but under his exquisite guidance, it didn't cause him the slightest harm. Instead, it carved and tempered his body. Jade must be carved to become a vessel!

“Is he actually cultivating?”

“How long do you think he'll last?”

“I bet less than the time it takes an incense stick to burn.”

“An incense stick? One hundred breaths would be good enough.”

“Aren't you all cultivating? Why bother with what others are doing?”

“I'm a blacksmith, thank you very much.”

Seeing Li Mo as if in a meditative trance like an old monk, some people began to discuss. Some even placed bets on how long True Disciple Li could endure here. However, the bets hadn't even been fully placed.

Li Mo, not far away, suddenly stood up.

“Damn, it hasn't even been thirty breaths! He's really not up to it!”

“Bets are closed! Haha, thank you, True Disciple Li, for helping me earn silver!”

“Wait a minute, he's not walking back!” Only after hearing that person's shout did everyone come back to their senses.

Indeed, True Disciple Li did not turn back, but continued to walk deeper. It looked like he was about to descend to the second floor.

What the hell? Is he crazy?

“No, he seems fine, doesn't he?”

“Hiss... this is insane.”

“Damn, he really went down to the second floor!” Everyone was dumbfounded.

They saw the young man's light footsteps as he passed through the gateway at the end of the first floor. His figure quickly disappeared at the end of the stairs. No way. When they set up their bets, they never imagined something like this would happen. How do we even calculate this? One should know that many cultivators in the Inner Breath Realm only stayed on the first floor. How could Li Mo be walking through it as if it were his own backyard?

“This sharp, weapon-killing aura shouldn't be entirely emitted by the weapons stored in Divine Blade Cave,” Li Mo mused. “Could there be something else on the lowest level of Divine Blade Cave?” Li Mo noticed a few clues. Others might not perceive it, but perhaps due to his Profound Womb Immortal Physique, he was extremely sensitive to such auras. If he were a blacksmith, he would undoubtedly be in his element. Thinking this, he became even more eager to explore deeper.

As soon as he descended to the second floor, there were fewer weapons in sight, but all eighteen types of weapons were still present. Many had nicks and chips, clearly having seen battle. He immediately felt his mind grow heavy and his consciousness become muddled. It was as if a chill had invaded his heart.

“Killing intent...” Li Mo took out a Heart-Cleansing Pill, placed one under his tongue, and only then did the sensation dissipate. He briefly assessed the situation. “I can still go further.” Li Mo continued onward.

He walked another hundred steps forward. Suddenly, he saw a figure. It was also a young man, dressed in white, cloud-patterned true disciple robes, wearing a purple-gold crown. The skin on his neck even faintly showed scale-like patterns. His delicate features were creased, his expression one of struggle.

Murong Xiao? The name surfaced in Li Mo's mind. So he looked with his Divine Fate Eye.

【Name: Murong Xiao.】
【Age: 16.】
【Bone Structure: Roaring Dragon Serpent Physique.】
【Realm: Qi-Blood Realm, Five Meridians.】
【Fate: Blue with traces of black.】
【Appraisal: His father is human, his mother a transformed dragon serpent. He is kind by nature but deeply affected by his own bloodline. If he can combine the advantages of both, his future is limitless; if he combines their drawbacks, he will become a disaster for one side.】
【Recent Encounter: Affected by the weapon-killing intent, his demonic nature is reawakening. If he cannot extract himself in time, his personality will likely undergo a drastic change!】

Killing intent entering his body? The last time he saw Murong Xiao's fate, it was blue with traces of purple. Now it was blue with traces of black! It was clear that this true disciple, with his half-demon physique, had reached a critical juncture between life and death. One thought leads to heaven, one thought leads to hell.
