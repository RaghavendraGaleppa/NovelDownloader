# Chapter 25: The Damaged Formation Disk

The item Gu Mo had his eye on was a first-tier formation disk—a tool that allowed cultivators unfamiliar with formations to quickly set them up. This particular disk was inscribed with both an illusion formation and a defensive formation. 

Unfortunately, the disk was damaged. Half of its formation stones were missing, and some of the inscribed patterns were incomplete. As a result, only one of the two formations could be activated at a time. Worse yet, the disk still required the same amount of spirit stones to power both formations, meaning it consumed double the resources while only providing half the functionality. 

This critical flaw had drastically reduced its value. Originally worth at least 1,000 spirit stones, the stall owner was now asking only 200. Without the double consumption issue, it could still have fetched 400 to 500 spirit stones as a standard first-tier formation disk.

"Would you take 100?" Gu Mo asked after some consideration.

Formations were currently his most urgent need after concealment techniques. Both the illusion and defensive formations on this disk would be perfect for his spirit field—ideal for hiding the presence of his Sunflowers while also protecting his crops from spirit insects and beasts. 

During his first planting season, Gu Mo hadn't faced many pest problems because abandoned fields naturally drove away insects. But now that cultivation had resumed, the spiritual energy from his plants would inevitably attract them. While his Gengjin Sword Qi could deal with intruders, prevention was always better than cure. Formations were the best defense—just like the massive array protecting the main spirit fields in the sect's valley, which activated during severe infestations to keep pests out.

Gu Mo's field, being outside the valley, had no such protection. Without proper defenses, a serious infestation could wipe out his entire harvest. Compared to that disastrous outcome, the disk's double consumption seemed a reasonable trade-off—especially since it was the only one he could afford. A standard first-tier disk from the sect's Formation Peak cost 500 spirit stones, far beyond his means.

"No deal!" The stall owner's fist clenched at Gu Mo's lowball offer, but noticing the Qinglu Sect insignia on Gu Mo's robes, he suppressed his anger and coldly refused.

In any sect, outer disciples were little better than beasts of burden, but they still outranked rogue cultivators. In this Qinglu-protected market, no rogue would dare provoke sect members.

"How about 120?" Gu Mo pressed, genuinely interested.

Seeing his sincerity, the stall owner relented slightly. After some haggling, Gu Mo secured the disk for 180 spirit stones—half his newly acquired wealth gone in an instant. Though painful, he knew this expense was necessary.

His next thought was to find a used magical tool, but he quickly dismissed the idea. While secondhand tools existed, their prices weren't much lower than new ones. Damaged tools were even riskier—no cultivator would gamble their life on faulty equipment, and repairs often cost more than buying new.

Just as Gu Mo prepared to leave, his gaze landed on a stall selling pseudo-spirit beasts—ordinary animals with faint traces of spiritual ancestry that might, with luck and training, evolve into true spirit beasts. These were usually rejects that had failed initial screenings, with the better specimens long since purchased by the Beast Taming Peak.

True first-tier spirit beasts matched Qi Refinement cultivators in combat power, effectively doubling a cultivator's strength—at the cost of doubling resource consumption. Only the wealthy could afford such luxuries. Gu Mo, barely self-sufficient, had no business considering one... except the prices here were temptingly low.

These leftover pseudo-beasts had minimal chances of evolving, hence their rock-bottom prices of three to five spirit stones each. This rekindled an idea Gu Mo had been nursing since obtaining Sun Essence: if it enhanced his cultivation, might it work on other beings? Human testing was out of the question, but a controllable spirit beast could be worth experimenting on. Success would mean a powerful combat ally.

"Brother, take a look at this one—it carries a trace of Howling Moon Wolf bloodline!" the stall owner eagerly pitched as Gu Mo lingered. When Gu Mo showed no interest in the large dog, the vendor quickly switched to a red sparrow: "Or this Crimson Sparrow, said to descend from the Vermilion Bird!"

Gu Mo ignored the sales pitch—such claims were too absurd to even debunk. His eyes settled on a forearm-length red carp in a basin. It wasn't special, but as a water-attuned pseudo-beast, it might learn the aquatic version of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique. If his experiment succeeded, the carp could handle irrigation, freeing him from daily watering duties and allowing extended absences without jeopardizing his crops.

"Brother has fine taste! This carp bears true dragon blood—once it leaps the Dragon Gate—"

"How much?" Gu Mo cut in.

"Three spirit stones." The vendor immediately dropped the act. All his patter was just to move these unwanted rejects.
