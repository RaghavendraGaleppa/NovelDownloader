**Chapter 15: Too Much Is Given**

The simplified style was quite system-like, and Chen Fei was very satisfied with this result. He calculated his daily step count; with a little effort, he could even cultivate the Water-Splitting Skill to the Grand Perfection realm in just one day.
At that time, Chen Fei's movement technique would show significant improvement. If he worked diligently, merging and cultivating all four movement technique manuals would only take four or five days. He would see if it could trigger some kind of qualitative change then.
Putting down the Water-Splitting Skill, Chen Fei picked up the Immortal Cloud Sword.
The simplification of the Water-Splitting Skill was expected. Now, the main question was whether the Immortal Cloud Sword could be recognized and optimized by the panel. If it could, the impact of lacking high-tier cultivation methods would be reduced for Chen Fei.
It took a full hour, by candlelight, leaving Chen Fei feeling a bit dizzy. Fortunately, the information about the Immortal Cloud Sword finally appeared on the panel.
[Cultivation Method: Immortal Cloud Sword (Incomplete)]
"Cultivation method discovered. Do you wish to spend fifty taels of silver to simplify Immortal Cloud Sword (Incomplete)?"
"It really is the Immortal Cloud Sword. Being incomplete is normal, but the simplification fee is a bit high."
Chen Fei's eyes lit up. His first goal was achieved. If it could be simplified, then the future was promising. Since he couldn't find authentic, complete high-tier cultivation methods, he could probably find a lot of these semi-authentic ones.
"Panel, simplify Immortal Cloud Sword!"

Merging Green Mountain Sword with Immortal's Guidance was naturally possible, but there had to be a primary and secondary.
Immortal's Guidance was higher tier, so it would definitely be the primary. This meant that the Grand Perfection Green Mountain Sword would have to discard most of its essence. Moreover, Immortal's Guidance was just a single move, actually more suitable for use as a killing strike rather than a complete sword art.
Otherwise, with only one move repeatedly, and Chen Fei not yet reaching the level of 'one sword breaking all techniques,' he would easily be targeted. In the end, Chen Fei regretfully separated the two once more.
"Can a simplified cultivation method be simplified again?"
An idea suddenly popped into Chen Fei's mind. Thinking of this, Chen Fei immediately issued a simplification command to the panel.
"Five hundred taels of silver!"
The information that popped up on the panel startled Chen Fei. Secondary simplification was possible, but it required ten times the amount of the first simplification.
"Having money truly brings happiness."
Chen Fei took a few deep breaths and turned his attention to the Water-Splitting Skill. He couldn't afford to simplify Immortal's Guidance, but the Water-Splitting Skill was still an option. Chen Fei just wanted to see what effect a secondary simplification would have.
"Water-Splitting Skill undergoing secondary simplification… Simplification successful… Water-Splitting Skill → Leg Quiver!"

In the afternoon, Chen Fei was cultivating by taking Qi-Blood Pills when Zeng Defang called him over.
"Today I asked the Young Mistress. After learning about your situation, she is also willing to nurture you. She plans to assign you to the medical hall near the North City Gate, to serve as a Deputy Steward."
Zeng Defang picked up his teacup, blew on it a few times, and took a sip before speaking.
"Is there a danger?"
Chen Fei frowned slightly. His first thought was that such a good opportunity shouldn't easily fall to someone like him. He had talent in alchemy, but it wasn't earth-shattering. How could he suddenly leap to the position of a medical hall Deputy Steward?
