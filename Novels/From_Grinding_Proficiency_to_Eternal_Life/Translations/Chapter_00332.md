# Chapter 332: I'll Bet on Luck with You!

Such a vicious act, one that obstructs the path of cultivation, sent a chill down Xu Yunfan's spine even as he stood as the beneficiary.

It seemed his former self was still too naive; there was still much to learn.

He secretly苦笑 (smiled a bitter smile). He used to think the martial world was treacherous, but only now did he realize that the games played in the halls of power were truly bloodless killings. In this world, where the path of transcendence existed, naturally, there was transcendent power influencing the fate of a nation.

By doing this, the Dao Sect paved a road to the heavens for him while simultaneously binding his fate to that of the sect on a tightrope over a cliff. If he continued to advance triumphantly, the Dao Sect could借龙脉玄黄气 (borrow the dragon vein's mysterious yellow energy) to reverse the heavens and earth, allowing him to complete his transformation and achieve凝聚一身浩瀚真气 (condense a vast true energy within his body), far surpassing the ordinary Ninth Realm.

But if he were to fall halfway, not only would the spiritual energy of heaven and earth he had consumed need to be repaid a hundredfold, but the thousand-year foundation of the Dao Sect would also suffer backlash from the Heavenly Dao. In the best-case scenario, their foundation would be destroyed; in the worst, the entire sect would be overturned.

"Master... you really think highly of me, to actually gamble the future of the Dao Sect."

Xu Yunfan subconsciously tightened his grip on the pair of Mountain Shaking Sea Suppressing Hammers at his waist. The hammers trembled slightly, as if responding to his turbulent emotions.

Such boldness made his heart tremble slightly.

"I truly underestimated the courage of these old monsters..."

But then again, the imperial examination path is restricted to those under thirty. Who else in the world under the age of thirty has reached the Ninth Realm, other than the current Xu Yunfan?

***

Deep within the Great Zhou Imperial Palace in Jade Capital City.

The aging Empress sat high on the dragon throne. After venting her anger, she slightly closed her phoenix eyes, resembling a statue.

The mottled shadows cast by the gilded dragon pillars in the hall cut her withered face into fragments of light and dark.

Suddenly, her fingertips trembled. The ever-burning lamp on her desk, made from the oil of South Sea merfolk and various rare life-extending treasures, suddenly went out. A wisp of green smoke twisted and rose, entering her body through her nostrils.

"The Kan-Li Turning Dragon Formation... has already been activated. If this continues... Guo Lang..."

She slightly raised her eyelids, looking at Guo Lang kneeling below, and said slowly, "The Dao Sect has gone too far to turn back. The Great Zhou has no way to retreat either. Eight hundred years ago, when Ancestor Li established the Great Zhou, the Dao Sect had already begun its plans. Perhaps back then, it was just a casual move, but who could have imagined that today, when I pried open the spiritual energy, this dragon vein geomancy array would finally come into play."

The Empress's hoarse voice sounded like a rusty knife scraping bone. The Grand Minister of the Imperial Observatory, kneeling below, trembled violently, his forehead knocking heavily against the white marble tiles. "Your Majesty, please see clearly! The geomancy in the Imperial Examination Hall has changed. The pillar of mysterious yellow energy pierced into the seventy-two districts' martial arenas. This is the sign of the Dao Sect forcefully seizing the dragon vein!"

The Empress let out a low laugh. Her thin, bony fingers slowly stroked the yellowed "Great Zhou Dragon Vein Map" on the desk. The mountain and river trends outlined in vermilion on the map were now faintly resonating with the boiling spiritual energy network beneath Jade Capital City.

She once sacrificed sixteen states, forcibly lifting the spiritual energy of heaven and earth from the ground veins to extend her depleting lifespan. Although she failed, relying on the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, she managed to survive for many more days. Now, the Dao Sect actually wants to pull the rug out from under her!

If the dragon qi of the Great Zhou is severed, and she loses the nourishment of the imperial court's aura, how can she survive?

"That old man Bi Yuan, he's even more ruthless than I thought, truly mad. After all these years, I thought he had tempered himself, but this gambler's nature still rises from his bones."

She suddenly coughed violently, black blood splattering on her sleeves, but she didn't care in the slightest. "Using the imperial examination as the board, using Xu Yunfan as the blade, gambling that the Great Zhou's fate is nearing its end..."

The Empress suddenly lifted her eyes, a sharp, cold light like the edge of a blade bursting from her turbid pupils. "I want to make them know that this dying dragon can still bite off the hunter's throat! I want to see who survives, the Dao Sect, or my江山万世无疆 (empire everlasting and boundless)! The Maitreya Temple has always wanted Buddhism to spread east. As long as I suppress the Dao Sect, I will declare it the state religion!"

She waved her sleeve, shattering the dragon desk, her stern shout echoing through the hall: "Issue the decree! From this moment, seal the nine gates. Any Dao Sect disciple entering Jade Capital is to be killed on sight! Additionally, summon the 'Heavenly Wolf Guard' with my tiger tally, and coordinate with the Imperial Observatory to sever the connection between the seventy-two districts and the imperial city's ground veins!"

Hearing this, Grand Minister Guo Lang's forehead broke out in cold sweat, but he dared not hesitate. He immediately kowtowed and said, "Your Majesty, please reconsider! The imperial examination has already begun. The seventy-two districts' martial arenas are completely linked to the Jade Capital's 'Kan-Li Turning Dragon Formation.' The mysterious yellow energy pillars are all converging on Xu Yunfan. If we forcibly sever the ground veins, it will inevitably cause the dragon qi to scatter and strike back! At that time, the lightest consequence is the collapse of the Great Zhou's fate, the dragon vein scattering, and the Great Zhou declining and moving towards ruin. The heaviest consequence... is the destruction of the Jade Capital's ground veins, and the entire Jade Capital being destroyed in an instant!"

As he spoke, Guo Lang buried his head even deeper, his forehead touching the ground.

"Your Majesty, you are already bound to the Great Zhou's dragon qi. If the dragon qi scatters, the consequences... are unimaginable!"

The Empress's eyes were icy cold. Her thin, bony fingers gripped the armrest of the dragon throne tightly, her knuckles turning pale. "You mean, I, the Great Zhou, must watch the Dao Sect use the imperial examination to steal my dragon qi?!"

Guo Lang's throat bobbed. Gritting his scalp, he continued, "Your Majesty, please see clearly! This situation has become an 'open scheme.' The Dao Sect uses the imperial examination as the shell and Xu Yunfan as the blade. They are gambling that the Great Zhou dares not destroy its own foundation.

Now, there are only two paths. Either interrupt the imperial examination and bear the backlash of the dragon vein. The Great Zhou will then be unable to recover. If managed well in the future, it may not be able to dominate the world again in a hundred years. Or..."

He took a deep breath. "Or, use a magnificent and upright method to defeat Xu Yunfan on the martial stage! As long as he is defeated, the mysterious yellow energy will naturally return tenfold to the Great Zhou, and the Dao Sect's thousand-year plan will come to nothing! Our Great Zhou will be able to extend a prosperous era."

The hall fell deathly silent. The Empress's chest heaved violently. After a long while, she suddenly let out a hoarse, cold laugh. "Truly a Bi Yuan... Truly an Xu Yunfan!"

She slowly rose, her black dragon robe moving without wind. "Since that is the case, pass my oral decree: Order the 'Heavenly Wolf Guard' to secretly clean up the Dao Sect's hidden agents in Jade Capital, but do not move against the seventy-two districts for now. Additionally..."

A hint of ruthlessness flashed in her eyes. "Send the experts from the palace to meet with the Maitreya Temple. Have them send people. I want to see if this Xu Yunfan is truly invincible under the heavens!"

Guo Lang secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Just as he was about to accept the order and withdraw, he heard the Empress add grimly, "If the Great Zhou loses this imperial examination... Minister Guo, you may bring your head to see me."

Guo Lang's scalp went numb. Not daring to argue in the slightest, he respectfully agreed.

The Empress's swift and decisive killing intent instantly turned into a storm of blood and rain within Jade Capital City.

The iron cavalry of the Imperial City Department trampled the blue stone slabs of the long streets. Deeper in the shadows, remnants of the Celestial Pivot Gate and the martial monks of the Maitreya Temple gathered quietly. They held the golden tallies secretly granted by the Empress and began capturing the hidden Dao Sect disciples.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan was completely unaware of the approaching crisis.

At that time, the Ninth Realm Qi Refining Grand Master Chen Wei of the Imperial City Department, seeing that he couldn't gain any advantage over Bi Sheng and receiving a flying letter, let out a cold snort.
