# Chapter 34: The Evil-Warding Sword Technique  

Thus, through a harmonious exchange with Scholar Zhao and the clan elders, Lin Shan smoothly became the Zhao family's Supreme Guest Elder. The Zhao family pledged to spare no effort in meeting all his demands.  

The family head even insisted on providing Lin Shan with an annual stipend, but Lin Shan firmly declined. The elders, moved to tears, expressed their gratitude once more, while the other clan members could only watch wide-eyed, leaving all decisions to their elders and the family head.  

In truth, many were secretly thrilled. Not only had the family survived a great calamity, but they had also gained the patronage of an innate master. As for the first-rate experts and servants Lin Shan had casually killed earlier, the family head and elders deliberately avoided mentioning them, and naturally, no one dared to voice any objections.  

---  

The next morning, in the main hall of the Zhao residence, a white-robed young man sat in the seat of honor at the center. Below him, rows of elders and stewards listened quietly as Scholar Zhao, standing before Lin Shan, issued new directives.  

"Third Brother, you'll handle the two major families in the northern district."  
"Fifth Uncle, the antique market in the southern district is your responsibility."  
"Seventh Sister, you'll oversee all pawnshops in the western district."  
"Nephew, take charge of all merchant guilds and escort agencies in the eastern district."  
"Guest Elder Yan, you'll manage the surrounding counties."  

"Remember this well!" Scholar Zhao continued. "What the young master seeks are antiques of significant age, imbued with cultural and historical significance—items widely celebrated, revered, or associated with religious worship.  

Oh, and one more thing—don’t bring any golden Buddha statues from temples. And..."  

As Scholar Zhao issued his orders, baskets of gold and silver were carried into the hall, along with chests of jewels and jade artifacts.  

"Don’t skimp on expenses for this antique acquisition. Buy everything that meets the young master's criteria. Understood?"  

The assembly bowed in unison. "We heed the family head's command!"  

Stealing glances at the white-robed figure on the throne, they saw him nod with a smile. Then, they carried away the treasures and dispersed to their tasks.  

---  

"Young master, I’ve ordered the discreet sale of some family assets to raise more funds. They should arrive soon, allowing us to acquire even more antiques."  

Scholar Zhao’s heart ached—these assets had taken the Zhao family a century to accumulate. But now, under duress, they had no choice but to sell them at a loss to fulfill their obligations.  

"Good," Lin Shan replied, setting down his teacup. He smacked his lips; though the tea was said to be exquisite, he found it bitter and couldn’t discern its supposed value.  

---  

"From now on, the Zhao family will focus on the antique trade. The kind of antiques I seek are rare in this world. You can keep whatever proves useless to me—consider it recycling."  

Lin Shan offered this advice kindly, and Scholar Zhao nodded eagerly.  

Recognizing the Zhao family’s efforts, Lin Shan knew better than to demand work without reward. He promised to assist if the family ever faced an insurmountable enemy.  

Scholar Zhao was overjoyed but understood that helping Lin Shan find antiques took priority. Once that was done, he could surely count on Lin Shan’s aid.  

After some idle chatter, Lin Shan settled into the Zhao residence while Scholar Zhao busied himself with financial arrangements.  

---  

Half a month later, chests of antiques were hauled into the main hall under the Zhao family’s supervision.  

"This way, this way!"  
"Careful!"  
"Put it there!"  

Scholar Zhao meticulously checked each item against the ledger, directing the placement of the antiques. Once everything was arranged, he nodded to Lin Shan and ushered everyone out, closing the door behind them.  

Alone in the hall, Lin Shan rubbed his hands together like an excited child, unsure where to begin.  

"So many antiques! Twenty thousand taels of silver—what extravagance! If I had to handle this alone, I’d never manage!"  

To put it in perspective, the entire Great Song Dynasty’s annual tax revenue was only four million taels. The remote Zangke Commandery, far in the southern frontier, paled in comparison to the prosperous Jiangdong region, with its annual tax revenue of just a hundred thousand taels.  

This hall full of antiques equaled two years of Zangke’s tax revenue and consumed a century of the Zhao family’s accumulated wealth.  

Gazing at the antique paintings, calligraphy, and jade carvings, Lin Shan truly appreciated the benefits of having a faction at his disposal. Without spending a single coin or lifting a finger, antiques from all over had flowed into his hands.  

"Don’t disappoint me now."  

Lin Shan began his favorite activity—touching and absorbing.  

---  

The hall’s doors remained shut from noon until sunset. Just as Scholar Zhao grew restless, the doors creaked open.  

Lin Shan stepped out, bathed in the golden light of dusk. Squinting, he savored the moment, feeling as though he were floating in a warm spring, his entire body light and euphoric.  

Scholar Zhao waited respectfully outside. After a moment, Lin Shan nodded slightly.  

"Take the antiques away. They’re of no use to me now."  

---  

The Zhao family had scoured all of Zangke Commandery for antiques meeting Lin Shan’s criteria. Yet, for various reasons, only six contained ancient essence—four with 1 point and two with 2 points.  

To Lin Shan’s surprise, one of the 2-point antiques was a manual titled *The Evil-Warding Sword Technique*!  

Years ago, rumors had spread across the southern martial world of a powerful innate sword technique, the *Evil-Warding Sword Technique*, lost to the major factions.  

Martial artists had gone mad with desire, fighting ruthlessly to claim it. The ensuing bloodshed claimed countless lives, including dozens of first-rate experts.  

Eventually, a ruthless half-step innate master seized the manual—only to find its opening line:  

**"To master this art, first sever the root!"**  

Few warriors were willing to become eunuchs unless absolutely necessary. After all, wasn’t power, wealth, and pleasure the very reason they sought strength?  

Had it been an innate cultivation method, some might have considered it. But for a mere sword technique? The half-step innate master scoffed and spread the truth far and wide.  

Since then, even commoners in the southern frontier knew of this bizarre martial art. Over centuries, it changed hands until the Zhao family’s antique sweep accidentally recovered it.  

**The Evil-Warding Sword Technique**  
Quality: Innate Martial Art  
Description: To master this art, first sever the root!  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

Lin Shan stared at the manual, his face twitching. He hadn’t returned it to Scholar Zhao because he suspected that, if enhanced, it might become a Qi Refining sword technique—something still valuable.  

Currently, his only spell, *Wind Blade*, was technically a Qi Refining technique, but it was essentially a basic attack—a simple application of spiritual energy.  

As a cultivator, Lin Shan wouldn’t brawl like a mortal. Spells and magical artifacts were the norm. *Wind Blade* was as fundamental as fireballs or water arrows—so basic the enhancement panel didn’t even acknowledge it.  

"This description is useless! Couldn’t you elaborate?"  

Lin Shan hesitated. He’d gained 8 points of ancient essence from the hall’s antiques—enough to enhance the *Evil-Warding Sword Technique*. But would the enhanced version still require castration?  

"Would it be worth it to become a eunuch for a Qi Refining spell?"  

Unwilling to gamble 8 points on an uncertain outcome, Lin Shan chickened out.  

"Never mind. I’ll keep it for now."  

Setting the manual aside, Lin Shan concluded his business with the Zhao family. The antique market in Zangke Commandery was likely tapped out.  

If he returned, it would be a century later—and there was no guarantee new antiques would yield ancient essence.  

"Cultural heritage in this feudal era is limited by low literacy and narrow circulation. Religious artifacts and faith-based relics—like the Black Lotus Sect’s items in the Yelang Ancient Tomb—are the real treasures."  

Still, the Nightingale faction might have more to offer...
