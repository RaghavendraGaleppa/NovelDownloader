# Chapter 18: The Divine Cult Invades, The President Appears!

A sharp sound echoed from the city wall.

Outside the Martial Artist Association, Bai Zhan's gaze instantly fell upon the city wall. He saw a group of black-robed figures standing there, each exuding a powerful aura. The weakest among them were powerhouses with Blood Qi level 5 or higher. The leader's aura, however, was comparable to Bai Zhan's! A Golden Body Realm expert! The invaders were actually a Golden Body Realm powerhouse!

"Divine Cult!" Bai Zhan glared fiercely at the black-robed figure before him, a beast-like roar tearing from his throat. His eyes filled with trepidation.

"Tsk tsk tsk, I didn't expect a dignified instructor from the Tianjiao Camp to come to such a godforsaken place. Oh, right, the human race produced a genius with golden potential. Your presence here is certainly expected." The leading black-robed figure cackled strangely, his crimson eyes like those of a bloodthirsty beast. His gaze swept over Hengcheng. "Hehehe, it's quite rare for a small Hengcheng to give birth to a genius with golden potential. It seems all of this city's millennia-old luck has fallen upon that person."

"What a pity, that brat is destined to die today!" The black-robed figure's voice gradually turned sinister, and a terrifying aura began to brew within his body.

"Kill!" A martial artist roared in fury, raised his weapon, and charged towards the Divine Cult's black-robed figures.

Inside the Martial Artist Association, Liu Kuang stood solemnly beside Su Yu, but the anxiety in his eyes was almost overflowing. His peripheral vision constantly fell upon Su Yu. "Kid, wake up quickly, otherwise, I don't know how I'll be able to protect you!" Liu Kuang gave a bitter laugh in his heart. In truth, he didn't fear the Divine Cult; what he feared was being unable to protect Su Yu. Especially since Su Yu was a genius with golden potential, a rare phoenix feather across the entire Great Xia. Such a person absolutely could not fall here!

At this moment, Su Yu's consciousness was immersed within his Sea of Consciousness. Su Yu opened his eyes in a daze, his surroundings completely golden, transforming into a golden ocean. "This is..." Su Yu was somewhat bewildered. Suddenly, Su Yu seemed to notice something: at the far end of the golden ocean, a graceful figure appeared to be standing quietly. For some reason, Su Yu felt an immense sense of familiarity. This back, it felt as if he had seen it somewhere before... However, this figure quickly vanished, replaced by a yellow stream of qi, quietly hovering before Su Yu's chest. "This is..." Su Yu's face showed confusion. Before Su Yu could react, that yellow stream of qi directly crashed into his body.

"Hehehe, in all my life, I've never hunted a golden genius before. I didn't expect to fulfill that dream this time."

"Tsk tsk tsk, the rewards for hunting a golden genius will be enough for us to break through to the Golden Body Realm, or even the Sky-soaring Realm." The three Divine Cult experts spoke amongst themselves, as if Liu Kuang was beneath their notice.

Hearing their conversation, Liu Kuang couldn't help but laugh out of sheer rage. "Mere rats from the Divine Cult dare to spout such nonsense in front of me!"

"You're asking for death!" Liu Kuang roared explosively, unleashing a punch imbued with powerful spiritual energy fluctuations. The spiritual energy, mixed with his Blood Qi, released formidable might.

The Divine Cult experts exchanged glances and instantly made their move. "I'll stop him; you two go kill that brat!" One black-robed figure roared, his spiritual energy similarly surging as he instantly attacked. The remaining two also nodded and charged towards Su Yu.
