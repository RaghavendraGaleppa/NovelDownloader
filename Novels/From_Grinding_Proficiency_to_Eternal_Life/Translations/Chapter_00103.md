# Chapter 103: The Dispute for True Disciple Status

In the Hall of Heavenly Works, eighteen bronze lamps with beast heads lit up one after another, casting a blood-red glow upon the cold iron weapons lining the walls.

In less than half an hour, the heads of the nine peaks and six divisions of the Heavenly Works Cavern had gathered. Even the Sect Master, Hong Baichuan, had made a rare appearance, showing just how much重视 was placed on the Forging Hall.

Hong Baichuan sat in the main seat, the vital energy around him steaming like wolf smoke. His breathing sounded like muffled thunder; this was the sign of a Master in the Marrow Cleansing Realm who had just finished training and had not yet settled his blood energy. It was clear he had rushed over immediately upon hearing the bell.

He was the only Marrow Cleansing Realm Master in the Heavenly Works Cavern and a renowned expert among the sixteen states of Yanbei Dao. Thanks to his presence, the Heavenly Works Cavern stood as the preeminent power among the Eight Sects of Cangzhou.

"This is only the third time the bell has been rung in twenty-five years," Hong Baichuan said, his voice rolling like thunder, causing the copper beams of the hall to vibrate slightly. "Hall Master Zhan has surprised me."

He looked down at Zhan Yan, who stood tall and straight, feeling somewhat intrigued. In the past, this old man had always been hunched over and usually silent. Now, however, he was radiating vitality, his spirit and demeanor completely transformed.

"I wish to hold a True Disciple ceremony," Zhan Yan declared, cupping his fist toward Hong Baichuan. He scanned the surroundings, seeing that the heads of the nine peaks and six divisions were all present, and spoke loudly.

Upon hearing this, the Head of the Medicine Hall frowned. "Hall Master Zhan, did you perhaps misremember? The Forging Hall has only been established for twenty-five years. Where does it get the qualification for True Disciples?"

"Eighteen years ago, the Golden Winged Tower besieged the mountain," Zhan Yan retorted, staring at the Head of the Medicine Hall. He casually grabbed the cold wine from the iron table and gulped it down, the liquid flowing down his muscular chest and into his fire-woven waistband. "Who led the defense of the Medicine Hall's thirty-six ground-fire furnaces?"

The Head of the Medicine Hall’s face turned pale and then green; he shut his mouth. Back then, it was Zhan Yan who had saved him at the cost of serious injuries; otherwise, he wouldn't be the Head of the Medicine Hall today.

The Head of the Hidden Blade Pavilion slammed his fist on the table with a cold snort. "Digging up old scores? According to the ancestral rules of the Heavenly Works Cavern, a newly established hall must wait thirty years before it is granted a True Disciple quota. Surely you know this, Hall Master Zhan?"

As he spoke, the bones in his body cracked like colliding steel ingots. The metallic resonance of fully tempered bones was one of the supreme techniques of the Heavenly Works Cavern, lending a harsh, grating edge to his voice, clearly indicating his displeasure.

The Hidden Blade Pavilion was naturally aggrieved by the Forging Hall, as many buyers specifically named the Forging Hall for transactions, bypassing the Hidden Blade Pavilion entirely.

"That is why Sect Master Hong granted three quotas back then," Zhan Yan countered. He pulled a red copper token from his waist and held it up. "I have not used them until now. Today, I still have three."

He circled the room to show everyone, then suddenly turned to face Hong Baichuan and bowed deeply. "I request the Sect Master to make the decision!"

The hall fell into sudden, dead silence.

The veins on the neck of the Hidden Blade Pavilion Head bulged like iron chains. Just as he was about to speak, a sound like striking stone and metal came from the main seat. Hong Baichuan had tapped his finger on the iron armrest, causing the entire hall's steel and copper beams to tremble.

"Continue," Hong Baichuan said.

Zhan Yan said, "The Forging Hall only accepts three True Disciples, and currently, I have only accepted one. At the Grand Furnace Opening Ceremony three months from now, anyone who can withstand the Ninefold Quenching Trial will be accepted!"

"Ridiculous!" The Head of the External Affairs Hall stood up abruptly, pointing at Zhan Yan's nose. "Which sect's True Disciples aren't forged in mountains of corpses and seas of blood? You, a blacksmith, want to use a quenching trial to fool the ancestral rules?"

Zhan Yan lowered his eyelids slightly and said calmly, "This Hall Master has also shed blood and tears for the Heavenly Works Cavern. Of the dozen disciples who came from the Divine Weapon Ridge back then, only two or three remain... If my disciples hadn't risked their lives to protect your External Affairs Hall back then, would you even be standing here spouting nonsense?"

"You..." The Head of the External Affairs Hall flew into a rage and was about to make a move.

"Enough!"

The moment Hong Baichuan stood up, all eighteen bronze lamps flared violently.

When this Marrow Cleansing Master took his first step, the floor tiles of the entire hall cracked inch by inch. When his second step landed, everyone's eardrums swelled as if struck by a heavy hammer.

"I promised the Forging Hall three True Disciple quotas, and I will not go back on my word. Three months later, hold the True Disciple ceremony for the Forging Hall to observe!"

Hong Baichuan's voice vibrated with vital energy. "However, the Forging Hall must add a rule: the other two quotas, during the True Disciple ceremony, will be open to disciples from other halls to compete. If they defeat the True Disciple you accept, you must take them in as True Disciples."

The Head of the Hidden Blade Pavilion let out a ferocious grin upon hearing this. "The Sect Master is wise! The Hidden Blade Pavilion accepts this True Disciple ceremony! I want to see if the Forging Hall's Thousand-Pound Hammer can block my Hidden Blade Pavilion's swords!"

The Head of the Mechanism Hall, who hadn't spoken a word, lifted his eyelids, glanced at the Head of the Hidden Blade Pavilion beside him, sneered, and shook his head without speaking.

Outside the hall, the heat from the ground fire surged suddenly.

Zhan Yan tucked the red copper token into his chest, cupped his fist to Hong Baichuan, and turned to leave. His expression flickered between light and shadow; he seemed somewhat happy.

"Then, let's rely on our own abilities. But let me give a warning first," he stopped at the hall door. "The ground-fire furnaces of the Forging Hall... don't distinguish between iron ingots and human bones. If we can't control our strength then, don't blame the Forging Hall for being ruthless."

The Head of the External Affairs Hall stared at Zhan Yan's retreating figure. "Hall Master Bao, are you really going to send people to test that quenching trial? It looks like our Hall Master Zhan is already well prepared."

"Send?" Hall Master Bao of the Hidden Blade Pavilion grabbed a cup of wine from the table and downed it, the liquid dripping through his fingers and sizzling on the floor. "The people I trained personally—will they be enough to tear three chunks of flesh from the Forging Hall?"

The Head of the Melting Gold Hall, playing with a golden abacus, suddenly interjected, "The Forging Hall exceeded its excavation quota for the year by seventy percent." Amidst the clashing of gold beads, a ledger slid out from his sleeve. "Sect Master Hong, do you know where these excess materials went?"

Having already settled the matter, Hong Baichuan, who had been ignoring the arguments below, turned his head to admire the "Heavenly Works Jade Cauldron Diagram" on the wall. Upon hearing this, he flicked his finger, the air surged violently with a muffled boom, and actually sucked the ledger over.

The ledger flew through the air to him, the pages turning on their own without wind. A Marrow Cleansing Master's control over power had reached the pinnacle.

"Seven hundred catty of cold iron, three hundred squares of fire-patterned jade..." Hong Baichuan's eyes flashed with a sharp light. He was somewhat surprised, but not entirely shocked.

He glanced at the Head of the Melting Gold Hall, a hint of a mischievous smile appearing on his face. "Is it because you guys are mining too hard?"

The Head of the Melting Gold Hall's face turned ugly; he bowed slightly to Hong Baichuan. "The Sect Master is wise."

Hong Baichuan consoled, "Your Melting Gold Hall is the cornerstone of our Heavenly Works Cavern. Your treatment is second only to the Forging Hall. When the time comes, just send people to compete for Zhan Yan's remaining two True Disciple quotas. But let me warn you, if anyone breaks the rules, don't blame this Sect Master for being ruthless."

Everyone felt a chill in their hearts and remained silent. They all knew this man's methods well. If anyone secretly tried to act against the Sect Master's decision, they would have to weigh whether their life was hard enough.

Leaving the hall, Zhan Yan's gloomy expression changed abruptly; he almost laughed out loud to the sky. This result was exactly what he wanted.

Although Hong Baichuan seemed to be biased, he actually left too much room for the Forging Hall to operate.

"I wonder which department's Three-Practice Warrior is strong enough to match that kid."
