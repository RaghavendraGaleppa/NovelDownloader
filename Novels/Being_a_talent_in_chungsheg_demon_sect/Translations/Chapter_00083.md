# Chapter 83: Pleasant Cooperation

In the cave dwelling, as Lü Yang's words fell, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord seemed to truly take this audacious junior seriously, suddenly chuckling: "You are very good. Are you interested in becoming my son-in-law?"

Lü Yang raised an eyebrow upon hearing this: "I recall, Senior already has a son-in-law."

"Zhao Xuhe's Coiling Dragon Legacy was seized by you, and I want the successor of the Coiling Dragon to become my son-in-law. As for who the successor is, I don't care." The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord said indifferently, smiling: "Your suggestion is very interesting, but it also exposed your true situation. It seems you don't have a Foundation Establishment True Human backing you. How about it? As long as you become my son-in-law, you and I will be family from now on. At that time, it's not impossible for me to help you."

Before his words finished, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord waved his hand. In an instant, the world spun. Lü Yang found that the surrounding environment suddenly changed. Above his head was the bright moon and starry sky; he had actually arrived at the summit of Heaven-Mending Peak!

"Qian'er, come out."

As the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's voice fell, Lü Yang saw a flash of brilliant light. From within the light walked out an graceful woman, exceptionally beautiful, with a cinnabar mark between her brows.

"Father, another one?" The woman was initially a bit lazy, but upon seeing Yu Suzhen, she immediately froze: "Father, although I don't mind, a female is still a bit..."

"You, I told you to cultivate diligently on weekdays. If you had cultivated my great divine ability, how could you not see the truth about this woman?" The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord looked at the woman helplessly, then with a shift of his divine sense, directly projected the entire cause and effect of the matter into the woman's sea of consciousness.

Following this, he looked back at Lü Yang: "This is my daughter, Chen Shuqian. She cultivates the 'Six Paths Nirvana Phoenix Art.' You cultivate the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art.' You two are naturally destined Dao Companions."

"When the two of you form a bond, the six and nine combine, and the effect is equivalent to a Foundation Establishment marvel!"

Lü Yang did not answer immediately upon hearing this, but fell into thought. Fairly speaking, the conditions proposed by the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord greatly tempted him. At first glance, if he agreed, it could be considered a great opportunity for both of them.

However, this was the Sacred Sect. How could an opportunity from the Sacred Sect be without problems?

But in the end, he still nodded happily: "Cooperation benefits both parties. This junior can agree to this, but it will have to wait until this junior attempts to break through to Foundation Establishment."

"That is natural." The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord laughed loudly: "After all, the higher your cultivation, the better the cultivation effect with my daughter will be at that time. I can also help you once with the matter of Hongyun. Don't worry, with me concealing the heavenly secrets for you, I guarantee that the bait he lays this time will catch nothing!"

"...Then many thanks, Senior." Lü Yang cupped his hands: "Pleasant cooperation?"

The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord grinned: "Pleasant cooperation."

As his words fell, Lü Yang promptly withdrew his consciousness. As he departed, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord waved his hand, sending Yu Suzhen back to her cave dwelling. Yu Suzhen naturally remained oblivious to everything that had just transpired. Her relevant memories had been effortlessly erased by the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord.

Only then did the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's daughter, Chen Shuqian, open her eyes and softly say: "Father, this person has a wolf's ambition. Do we really want to cooperate with him?"

The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord had now also reined in his smile. He coldly chuckled: "Wolf's ambition? Wolf's ambition is exactly right! Which Sacred Sect disciple doesn't have a wolf's ambition? As for cooperation... I just said it casually. First, stabilize him, lest he become a frightened bird and flee somewhere I can't see."

Chen Shuqian asked curiously: "So, Father doesn't plan to help him?"

"No, I plan to help him." The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord shook his head: "Hongyun's current state is not good, otherwise, he wouldn't need to fish for destiny in the Sacred Sect every so often."

"If not for that, that fellow Chongguang wouldn't dare covet the 'Fudeng Huo'."

"In this situation, if I scheme against Hongyun once, causing his fishing attempt to fail this time and his destiny to be depleted, I can conveniently do Chongguang a favor."

"Why not?"

"What's more, if this person truly intends to use the Heavenly Secret Pilfering Art for a complete deception, I can just use the connection of vital energy to find the location of his main body."

"This individual managed to obstruct me on the Great Karma Web for a moment earlier, indicating they must possess a certain status. Their innate quality is dozens of times superior to Zhao Xuhe's. Once I find their main body and capture them, you can use the Heaven-Mending True Scripture to drain them dry. This can increase your chances of Foundation Establishment by at least thirty percent!"

In his words, it seemed Lü Yang had already been treated as fish on a chopping board. Chen Shuqian, however, still seemed somewhat worried: "But my brother is still in his hands..."

"Don't worry." The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord said faintly: "As long as Xin'an appears in my sight, nothing will happen. Even if his soul scatters, I can reassemble it!"

"That old man definitely has ill intentions!"

Outside the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm, Lü Yang opened his eyes, his gaze cold: "He must be plotting against me, trying to find my true body to serve as a resource for his daughter."

"As for Chen Xin'an, it's not a guarantee either."

"After all, that's a Peak Lord of the Sacred Sect, an absolute powerhouse even among Foundation Establishment True Humans. Could such a person truly care about kinship?"

Thinking of this, Lü Yang couldn't help but scratch his head. This was truly difficult. How did others manage to break through to Foundation Establishment, compared to him? They couldn't possibly just casually accumulate a great divine ability, a Foundation Establishment spiritual item, a Foundation Establishment secret art, and then with only thirty percent hope, gamble their lives on a breakthrough, could they?

"Unfortunately... as things stand, gambling is my only option."

Lü Yang's gaze shifted to the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm before him. Although he was well hidden now, it was conceivable that he couldn't hide forever.

"Moreover, the Heavenly Secret Pilfering Art was originally created by the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord. Once I activate it to drain Yu Suzhen, it's very possible he'll follow the clues to my doorstep. At that time, only by relying on the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm will I have a sliver of a chance. Perhaps I can even leverage the Golden Core Sword Qi to deal them a severe blow..."

With the Golden Core Sword Qi present, the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm was Lü Yang's natural safe haven. As long as he hid inside, even if he were discovered, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord and Daoist Hongyun might not dare to enter. At that time, he could slowly cultivate within the secret realm, gather the [Profound Underworld Lord's Netherworld Authority], cultivate the 'Severing Thoughts to Behold My True Self Heavenly Silkworm Secret Art,' and refine himself into a Corpse Liberation Immortal. At worst, he could still attempt Foundation Establishment with a sixty percent chance of success!

As for the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm's "enter but not exit" problem, it was naturally irrelevant to him. As long as he could achieve Foundation Establishment, he could simply commit suicide and reincarnate. If anything, the Golden Core Sword Qi was an unstable ticking time bomb. After all, based on his experience from the previous life, this Golden Core Sword Qi would eventually slaughter the entire Witch-Ghost Secret Realm. Lü Yang didn't know the reason behind this.

"The answer to this problem likely lies with the Listening Nether Sect."

Lü Yang recalled the statue of the Listening Nether Sect's Ancestral Master he had seen before, pondering: "That Listening Nether Ancestral Master was likely a Foundation Establishment cultivator who survived from the Witch-Ghost Dao era."

"Could it be that he did something that provoked the Golden Core Sword Qi to slaughter the secret realm?"

The more Lü Yang thought, the more solemn his expression became: "From this perspective, if I want to cultivate steadily within the secret realm, I must first resolve the issues with the Listening Nether Sect, otherwise, I will eventually be annihilated by the Golden Core Sword Qi."

At this thought, Lü Yang finally made his decision.

Enter the secret realm with his true body!
Take the gamble!
