# Chapter 137: Confrontation

After killing four maids in succession, Li Shimin's hands remained untainted by blood. Apart from the punctures in his robe, he stood as composed as when he had first arrived, gazing calmly at Yun Ze.

"Kill me," Yun Ze slumped onto the stone stool, his voice despondent. With his spiritual power sealed, his late Qi Refining cultivation was now weaker than even a maid's, leaving him utterly defenseless.

Li Shimin approached and placed a gentle palm on Yun Ze's chest. 

Though his spiritual power was sealed, his spiritual sense remained unimpeded. In this environment, Li Shimin still held several trump cards. His spiritual sense penetrated Yun Ze's body. The seemingly ordinary palm strike concealed a jade sword formed from his spiritual sense, which he sent directly into Yun Ze's spiritual vortex.

With no resistance due to the seal, the spiritual vortex shattered instantly upon impact. The strike didn't kill Yun Ze but caused him to spit blood. The injury, however, was far more severe than it appeared—Li Shimin had destroyed the foundation of Yun Ze's cultivation. The collapse of the spiritual vortex under the seal left no room for resistance, damaging his spiritual roots irreparably.

Spiritual root damage could only be healed by the rarest of medicines—something even Golden Core elders would struggle to obtain, let alone Yun Ze.

"You've ruined my path to immortality!" Yun Ze's eyes burned with fury as he pointed a trembling finger at Li Shimin, his voice thick with resentment.

For a cultivator, death was preferable to becoming a cripple—a being who once soared through the heavens, now reduced to needing help even for basic needs.

"As a sect disciple, I'll hand you over to the sect for judgment," Li Shimin said coldly. He took Yun Ze's storage pouch from his waist and hung it on his own belt without hesitation.

With Yun Ze now a cripple, Li Shimin turned his attention to the stone table beneath them. He was deeply curious about the formation that could suppress spiritual power. 

Formations typically relied on spiritual energy to function, making a formation that suppressed it paradoxical—something he, as an intermediate formation master, had never encountered. 

Even more intriguing was the object that had evaded his spiritual sense. Since awakening his spiritual sense, it had been an infallible tool.

Beneath the table lay an unassuming metal box, slightly ajar, revealing a dark-glowing cube within.

---

The box was small, and the cube inside even smaller—no larger than a fist. 

At a glance, Li Shimin realized his earlier assumption was wrong. This wasn't a formation. The actual formation here had been a concealment array meant to hide the box from detection. 

His spiritual sense had detected the concealment array but found nothing beyond it, so he had dismissed it. Concealment arrays were common in personal quarters—his own cave abode had several.

He tried using his spiritual sense again, but despite the box and cube being right before his eyes, his spiritual sense perceived only a fog, obscuring everything.

His limited knowledge left him unaware of the cube's nature. Otherwise, he would have recognized the anomaly immediately.

After some study, Li Shimin realized the terrifying spiritual suppression effect emanated from the cube itself. The metal box, made of an unknown alloy, contained the cube's power. When he entered the courtyard, Yun Ze had activated a mechanism to open the box, exposing the cube and suppressing all spiritual energy in the area.

Pressing a hidden switch, Li Shimin closed the box silently. Immediately, he felt his spiritual vortex stir back to life as ambient spiritual energy returned.

"What is this?" Li Shimin asked, holding up the box.

Yun Ze, his face ashen, offered no reply.

Shaking his head, Li Shimin took out his identity jade slip and contacted Elder Xu of the Enforcement Hall, reporting the situation. He decided to wait there for the enforcers' arrival rather than leave.

---

Outside the courtyard, two pairs of eyes watched from a distance. 

They were Yun Clan spies, tasked with monitoring Yun Ze. Given Yun Ze's past behavior, the Yun Trading Company's higher-ups had little trust in him—a standard practice for the organization.

"That's an Enforcement Hall disciple—something's happened. Report it immediately!" one whispered urgently.

The Enforcement Hall's response was swift. Upon receiving Li Shimin's report, Enforcer Xu arrived with twelve enforcers in moments.

Meanwhile, the Yun Trading Company, realizing their plan had gone awry, contacted their backers within the sect. Among the Yun Clan's two Foundation Establishment elders, only Elder Yun Gang was available.

---

Enforcer Xu stood outside the courtyard, prepared to forcibly dismantle its defensive formation. 

The Enforcement Hall wielded significant authority—with reasonable suspicion, they could take drastic measures. Given that an intermediate formation master was involved, the sect permitted forceful intervention.

Within the sect's nine peaks, dismantling a formation was easier—the Enforcement Hall could petition the sect's grand formation overseers to assist. A senior formation master stationed at the Dui Peak could authorize the grand formation to override individual defenses.

Before Enforcer Xu could act, however, the courtyard's formation deactivated on its own, revealing the scene inside.

Xu and his enforcers flew over the walls rather than using the gate.

The sight inside made Enforcer Xu's expression harden. Four corpses were one thing, but this was within the sect's nine peaks—a place where such brazen violence hadn't occurred in years.

He recognized Yun Ze, a minor figure in business circles but unfamiliar to a Foundation Establishment elder like himself. Yun Ze's chaotic spiritual aura indicated crippled spiritual roots—a fate reserved for the gravest of grudges.

Finally, Enforcer Xu turned to Li Shimin. Unlike the others present, he understood the weight of Li Shimin's connections. Though he knew little about the young man personally, Li Shimin had once sent another enforcer, Enforcer Xu, to serve twenty years at the Tianhai frontlines—a case Xu himself had closed, leaving a lasting impression.

"Disciple Li, we meet again," Enforcer Xu greeted with a nod.

His demeanor puzzled the other enforcers—Enforcer Xu
