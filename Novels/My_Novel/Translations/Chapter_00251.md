# Chapter 251: A Heaven-Shaking Fortuitous Encounter, the Pure Yang Dweller, and the Inheritance Obtained!

In a forest where they had stopped to rest, a campfire burned brightly.

A lake fish, its scales removed, was skewered on a stick and roasted over the flames. Wild herbs were added for seasoning, and the aroma of charcoal-grilling drifted through the air.

Li Xian said, "Go on, eat. After you're done, I'll kill you." He handed the cooked fish to the disciple of the Wujidao Sect.

The disciple was stunned for a moment, trembling with fear. He stammered, "G-great Hero... I... I don't want to die. It's true the sect sent me to find you, but... but I never even touched you. Logically, we have no grievance. C-could you spare my life?"

Li Xian replied, "If I were in your hands, you would kill me too. Hurry up and eat. I'll let you die with dignity and even help you dig a grave. What's your name? I can even make a tombstone for you."

Knowing he had no hope of survival, the disciple gave his name and ate the grilled fish with tears in his eyes. True to his word, Li Xian killed him with a single sword strike, then helped him dig a grave and bury him. He carved a wooden plank and inscribed the disciple's name on it.

After finishing these tasks, the other two fish were also cooked.

Li Xian sprinkled some salt and handed one to Wen Caishang. He peeled back the skin, revealing tender, flaky flesh from which juices flowed. As he ate, Li Xian said gravely, "My Lady, although we've been leaving markers along the way and heading east, the canopy is so thick it blocks out the sky. I can't be sure we're going the right way. We might already be lost!"

Wen Caishang nodded. "The Tiger's Cry Ridge is over eight hundred miles long, and next to it is a mysterious mountain range. If we're lost, it could take ten or twenty years to get out."

Li Xian laughed. "If that's the case, I don't know whether to be happy or worried." Wen Caishang knew he was about to say something cheeky and asked with a smile, "You rascal, how could you possibly be happy about this?"

Li Xian broke off the fish's head and slurped out the eyes, eating with relish. "Even if we can't get out, I won't be lonely. I have you with me, and I can hold you while I sleep. All around us, besides me, are wild monkeys, wild boars, and wild tigers. I, Li Xian, might be useless, but I'm surely better than a wild boar or a wild dog. Since you have no one else to choose from, you'll just have to sleep with me."

"You little scoundrel, your words are so unpleasant! Always talking about wild boars and wild dogs!" Wen Caishang's heart was sweetly warmed, but she feigned anger. "Hmph, you might be happy to be a wild man, but I'm not."

Her mind drifted, and she thought, "If we really can't get out, what Li Xian said isn't entirely wrong. If we were in a place like this, he and I..." Her pretty face flushed, and she couldn't help but steal a glance at him. After days of奔波 in the dense forest, Li Xian's demeanor remained clear and bright, his spirit broad and open. No matter where he was, he was always composed.

His appearance and bearing were unimpaired. Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes lingered on him.

After Li Xian and Wen Caishang realized that Su Qiuwu and the others were in no position to help themselves, they began to plan their escape from the forest. Continuing east was an unknown distance of thousands of miles, so returning west along their original path seemed the safer option.

Wen Caishang said, "We believe we've been heading east, but the terrain is so complex we may have already偏离 our direction. If we head west now, we might not be able to get out of the forest. And if we then want to return to this resting forest, it will be difficult."

Li Xian asked, "That may be true, but we can't stay in this resting forest forever."

Wen Caishang, her face flushed, said, "I have a method. Please turn around."

Li Xian turned his back and heard a rustling sound. Suddenly, he felt a piece of cloth being pushed into his hand. It was smooth to the touch, like silk.

He looked down. It was a golden-red color with intricate embroidery, still retaining some warmth. It was actually Wen Caishang's silk undergarment. Li Xian said, "Ah! My Lady... you... what do you mean by this?"

Wen Caishang replied, "We are heroes of the Jianghu, why the big fuss?" As she spoke, her cheeks were pink. "Pull out the silk threads and wrap them around that big tree three times..."

She was using the silk fabric to set up a strange formation. Once the formation was complete, the silk threads within a several-mile radius would be mysteriously attracted to each other, preventing them from getting lost.

Wen Caishang said, "We will head west. Every two miles, we'll set up a similar silk formation. That way, if we get lost, we can still find our way back to this resting forest."

Li Xian cupped his fists in admiration. "My Lady is truly great!"

Wen Caishang's face instantly turned crimson, a mix of shame and anger. She was extremely annoyed by Li Xian's glib tongue and cursed, "Go die!" She kicked out at him.

When Qiu Yue had betrayed the manor, Wen Caishang had used this exact method to track her precisely. The servants, guards, and silkworm girls in the manor all had small silk formations embroidered on their clothes.

No matter where they fled, she could follow the trail, and the more she followed, the more precise her tracking became.

And so, they headed west. Every two miles, they would cut a piece of silk to form a formation. The undergarment was finely made, but with such consumption, the fabric was gradually running out.

After walking west for three days, both Li Xian and Wen Caishang felt heavy-hearted. The scenery along the way was completely unfamiliar. Li Xian had an excellent memory; even though the forest was complex, he should have had some impression.

At this point, there was no need to continue. Li Xian and Wen Caishang realized that although they had thought they were heading east, they had actually been lost for half an hour after entering the forest.

Li Xian said, "It's a shame it can't be worn anymore." Wen Caishang's frustration instantly vanished, and she said angrily, "You're still joking! It's a real pity I never stitched your mouth shut before!"

Li Xian thought mischievously, "If we really can't get out, I'll have to stitch your mouth." He quickly apologized, saying some sweet and auspicious words to cheer Wen Caishang up.

Left with no other choice, after another three days, they turned back to the resting forest.

The vast sea of trees trapped the two like a lone boat. They could hear the wind rustling the leaves and see the brilliant stars in the sky. They were at a loss, utterly helpless.

Li Xian did not lose heart. He thought of countermeasures and practiced his martial arts, day after day as usual.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]
[Seven Star Step]
[Proficiency: 1569/3000, Minor Accomplishment]

His lightness skill became more proficient, and his progress was comforting. Li Xian thought, "With my Lady by my side, even if I can't get out, my martial arts won't suffer. As my martial path advances, I'll slowly explore and do my best!"

Along the way, they endured wind, rain, and thunder. He was always able to stay alert and focus on the path ahead.

There was a lake in the resting forest. Fish, rabbits, wild boars, snakes, and other common prey were not scarce. Li Xian figured it would be difficult to leave in the short term, so he focused on living well in the present. He hunted a wild boar and cooked it slowly.

Wen Caishang frowned, thinking, "In this situation, wandering around aimlessly could be fatal. Although I'm at a loss right now, I can stay here long-term, adapt to the circumstances, and find a way to dissolve the poison. If I can解开 the Qi-Eating Gu, I can raise my ancestral silkworms and collect silk. With ten years of accumulation, this mysterious mountain range, the Tiger's Cry Ridge... where could I not go?"

She looked at Li Xian, her heart stirred, and murmured, "But... it would be a bargain for this小子."

Ten years of loneliness, one should seek joy. During these days and nights, as they slept on the ground together, Wen Caishang said, "Li Lang, we can't get out for now. Tomorrow, build a wooden house, and we'll live here."

Li Xian said, "I was thinking the same thing."

Wen Caishang said, "One wooden bed will do, but it needs to be sturdy." Li Xian was usually very smart, but he didn't catch the deeper meaning for a moment. He laughed, "I guarantee it will be flat and even, and you won't find it lacking."

Wen Caishang placed her hand on his chest, her desires stirring. The next morning, she pulled Li Xian up to practice the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword" together, nurturing their affection.

They danced until both were sweating. Li Xian then took his sword to chop wood. Wen Caishang sat cross-legged practicing her internal arts. After a day of work, the wooden house already had its basic shape.

Two more days passed.

The wooden house was square and neat, with a hall, a bedroom, and a courtyard. Though small, it had everything a home needed. Wen Caishang's heart pounded, and the blush on her face had yet to fade.

Wen Caishang asked softly, "Li Lang, do you have something on your mind?" She saw that Li Xian seemed to be deep in thought.

Li Xian smiled. "It's nothing, my Lady. Please go to bed first. I need to think of something."

Wen Caishang thought, "Li Lang is so young, and being trapped in this forest, he must be frustrated. He ended up in this situation because he was trying to save me. I shouldn't disturb him."

She returned to the bedroom and waited quietly, undressing. In this remote wilderness, sharing a bed and sleeping together had a unique charm.

Suddenly, she heard a shout from outside: "My Lady... I've thought of a way!" He burst into the room, his expression excited.

Wen Caishang was startled. "What way?"

Li Xian said, "Today, while I was chopping wood to build the house, I had a nagging feeling, as if I was overlooking something. I remembered you saying that this resting forest was a place for craftsmen to rest while digging a tomb."

"There must be a tomb nearby. It's highly likely that there's a map in the tomb. Otherwise, why build a tomb in this desolate wilderness? If we can get the map, we can naturally get out."

Wen Caishang said, "It's worth a try!" Her eyes gleamed. She had already guessed there might be a tomb nearby, but she hadn't dared to think too much about it because of the surrounding dangers. Now, upon careful consideration, it was indeed feasible.

That night, they discussed their plan. Wen Caishang observed the feng shui and surveyed the land on the spot. Li Xian chopped wood to make arrows, stockpiling supplies, and gathered the silk threads.

The next day.

They set up a "silk formation" in the resting forest. Wen Caishang had observed the stars and surveyed the feng shui the previous night, guessing that the tomb was to the southeast.

The two headed southeast, setting up a silk formation every two miles. If the plan failed, they could still return to the resting forest to live.

This time, their luck was good. After walking more than ten miles, they saw another resting forest.

Li Xian set up a "silk formation" in this new resting forest, then returned along their original path to collect the silk threads they had laid down.

This resting forest was about three miles in circumference. Inside was a tombstone with the inscription: "A tomb for Xingxiu, set up halfway through his journey."

Wen Caishang said joyfully, "If we dig up the tomb, we might find a clue."

They dug three feet into the ground and found a skeleton. Wen Caishang used her sword to lift the tattered cloth and examined it closely. "This is from a very long time ago!"

"This fabric is 'hemp杉', which was popular during the Nanyang period. By this logic, if there is a tomb here, it must be from the Nanyang period!"

Li Xian asked, "Nanyang?"

Wen Caishang said, "It is now the 39th year of the Da Wu reign. The Great Wu Dynasty has been in power for nine hundred and thirty-two years."

"The dynasty before Great Wu was called Great Yu. It lasted for eight hundred and eighty-two years. Before Great Yu was a period of chaos, with many states vying for power, the people in hardship, but many extremely powerful figures also emerged."

"This Nanyang State, located in the southern region, was one of them."

"The Nanyang people revered the south. Tomorrow, we will explore to the south!"

They rested for the night.

The two repeated their old trick, setting up silk formations along the way. After inching their way forward, they indeed saw another resting forest.

After repeating this several times, passing through several resting forests, a towering mountain appeared before their eyes.

Wen Caishang said, "The entrance to the tomb is at a spot one hundred and ninety-seven zhang away, but it has been blocked. We need to find another way in."

"This tomb... might be a fortuitous encounter!"

The tomb was hidden in the great mountain, shaped with a square base and a round top, symbolizing "standing between heaven and earth," full of majestic气势.

It must be the burial place of an extremely powerful warrior.

"It is said that during the Nanyang period, there was a warrior with astonishing luck. He consumed 'heavenly essence' and 'earthly精华,' his Dao was heaven-shocking, he rode the wind and soared through the void, free and unfettered with his sword."

"That warrior's name was Lü Dongzhi, his title was the Pure Yang Dweller."

"Could it be... that this is the place!"
