# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 126: Supreme-Grade Spiritual Artifact  

A streak of light descended from the sky as Lin Xuan arrived before an elegant complex of buildings. The archway bore two large characters: "Guest Pavilion."  

Having now restored his original appearance, he presented his visiting card. Recognizing him as the young sect master of the Spirit Medicine Mountain, the attending disciples warmly welcomed him and assigned him to the finest quarters—a secluded pavilion.  

Once inside his chamber, Lin Xuan closed the door and carefully scanned the surroundings with his spiritual sense, ensuring no surveillance or prying eyes. Satisfied, he nodded. Still, he took no chances, forming hand seals to set up a warning barrier around the room. Caution never hurt.  

Then, from his storage bracelet, he retrieved a pitch-black dagger.  

At first glance, it appeared unremarkable, yet it radiated astonishing spiritual energy. Upon closer inspection, faint silver rings shimmered along its surface, pulsing like a living thing. The dagger seemed restless, struggling as if alive, but with each movement, the silver rings flared, shocking it back into submission—a sealing spell.  

Watching this, Lin Xuan allowed a faint, intrigued smile to cross his lips.  

This dagger, of course, had belonged to the Daoist in the herb garden. After unexpectedly slaying the female disciple, it had attempted to flee. By sheer coincidence, its path had led straight to Lin Xuan’s hiding spot.  

Opportunities like this were rare. Naturally, he wouldn’t let such a treasure slip away. Channeling his spiritual energy, he swiftly captured it.  

Having witnessed the woman’s demise, Lin Xuan wasn’t about to repeat her mistake. He immediately sealed the dagger with a restrictive spell before quietly slipping away from the herb garden amidst the chaos caused by the two male disciples. Now, safely settled in the guest pavilion, he reflected on his fruitful scouting trip.  

Aside from acquiring this dagger, he had also gained a clear understanding of the herb garden’s defenses. The Seven-Colored Sword Formation guarding it could annihilate even Core Formation cultivators with ease. Rushing in recklessly was out of the question—he would need to bide his time for the right opportunity.  

Shaking his head, Lin Xuan set those thoughts aside for now. First, he needed to unravel the mysteries of this dagger.  

Extending his spiritual sense, he enveloped the weapon. The dagger twitched, resisting fiercely, but the sealing spell forced it back into submission. Lin Xuan then forcibly injected his own spiritual awareness into it...  

Half an hour later, he withdrew his senses, his expression pensive. Resting his chin on his hand, he pondered deeply before scrutinizing the dagger once more.  

The disciples of Green Cloud Mountain had claimed that even supreme-grade spiritual artifacts could barely scratch the Thorn Demon, yet this dagger had effortlessly slain it. Its power rivaled that of a magic treasure!  

But this dagger was clearly not a magic treasure—such high-tier artifacts were far beyond the control of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Moreover, it seemed sentient, almost alive.  

Recalling this, Lin Xuan’s heart stirred. He had once read about something similar in an ancient text.  

Could this be one of the legendary supreme-grade spiritual artifacts?  

Common knowledge held that spiritual artifacts were forged from rare materials like mystic iron, golden sand, or the bones and fangs of demonic beasts. Depending on the quality of materials and the skill of the craftsman, they were classified into four grades: low, medium, high, and supreme.  

Yet few knew that in ancient times, there existed an even rarer tier—the supreme-grade spiritual artifact.  

Superior to even the finest of spiritual artifacts, its power could reach thirty percent of a magic treasure’s might.  

To put this into perspective, even the most renowned supreme-grade spiritual artifacts typically possessed only ten percent of a magic treasure’s strength.  

This alone spoke volumes about its rarity and value.  

However, crafting a supreme-grade spiritual artifact was an immensely difficult task. The materials required were highly specific—ordinary mystic iron or golden sand wouldn’t suffice.  

Only certain demonic beasts’ bones or fangs could be used.  

For instance, this dagger was forged from the fangs of a second-tier demonic beast known as the "Venomous Demon Serpent," a species now nearly extinct.  

Merely finding such a beast wasn’t enough. Besides a master craftsman, a ghost-path cultivator was needed to extract the beast’s spirit. Once the artifact was forged, the spirit would be sealed back into it using a special technique.  

The process was fraught with difficulties, with a success rate of less than five percent.  

Moreover, the methods for crafting supreme-grade spiritual artifacts differed from conventional ones, and many had been lost to time. Only fragments of knowledge remained in ancient texts. None had surfaced in the cultivation world for centuries.  

Examining the dagger closely and confirming its identity, Lin Xuan’s face lit up with joy.  

But before he could claim it as his own, there were still a few steps left.  

Unlike ordinary spiritual artifacts that could be wielded simply by channeling spiritual energy, supreme-grade artifacts required a blood-binding ritual. This was why the Daoist could use it, while the Green Cloud Mountain disciple had suffered backlash upon touching it.  

First, Lin Xuan needed to erase the Daoist’s spiritual imprint. Gripping the dagger, he poured his spiritual energy into it, initiating the refinement process...  

Two hours later, Lin Xuan wiped the sweat from his brow.  

The Daoist had been at the second layer of Foundation Establishment, making it theoretically difficult for Lin Xuan, at a lower cultivation level, to erase his imprint. Fortunately, the Nine Heavens Profound Art he practiced granted him exceptional power, and after relentless effort, he succeeded.  

Next, he pricked his finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the dagger, chanting an incantation to complete the blood-binding ritual.  

With everything in place, Lin Xuan finally removed the sealing spell from the dagger.  

Delighted, he examined his new weapon. Though unsightly, its unassuming appearance was an advantage—perfect for ambushes.  

After storing the dagger away, Lin Xuan retrieved the *Heavenly Thunder Scripture*.  

Holding the ancient tome, he paused thoughtfully before producing a fresh jade slip. Carefully, he transcribed a copy of the scripture’s contents into it.
