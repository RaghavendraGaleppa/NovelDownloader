# Chapter 155: The Duel

Standing atop his flying boat, Senior Brother Du gazed coldly at Li Shiming from a distance, his eyes filled with killing intent as if Li Shiming were already a dead man.

Both were at the Qi Refinement stage, but disciples with Heavenly Spirit Roots held overwhelming advantages. The best main cultivation techniques, the strongest body-refining methods, and abundant resources—all were provided to ensure Heavenly Spirit Root disciples built the most solid foundation during Qi Refinement.

Another advantage of superior talent was the luxury of time. Without needing to consider secondary professions during Qi Refinement, they had more time to cultivate powerful spells and gain combat experience from their assigned mentors.

At least within the Holy Ice Sect, Heavenly Spirit Root cultivators existed on an entirely different level from ordinary disciples.

Senior Brother Du possessed all of Li Shiming’s information. The latter had mastered the *Diamond Body Protection Divine Technique* to the point of manifesting its true intent—a feat surpassing even his own body-refining achievements. Li Shiming had also studied the strongest *Sword Control Art* and possessed deep knowledge of formations.

Reviewing the records, Senior Brother Du could tell this was an exceptionally diligent cultivator. But with a Three Spiritual Roots aptitude, if Li Shiming had talent in body-refining, he should have focused entirely on strengthening that aspect. Instead, the records showed Li Shiming dabbling in everything—*Sword Control Art*, formations, and even agriculture in his early days.

Li Shiming had only been in the sect for four years. Did he truly believe he could master all these disciplines in such a short time? Did he think himself a Heavenly Spirit Root talent?

The only thing Senior Brother Du needed to be wary of was Li Shiming’s body-refining. As for the *Sword Control Art*, he paid it no mind. On the open sea, Li Shiming’s body-refining prowess would naturally be halved in effectiveness.

Unlike Foundation Establishment cultivators, those at Qi Refinement couldn’t fly freely and relied entirely on magical tools, limiting their mobility and thus the advantages of body-refining.

Senior Brother Du’s flawless mission record wasn’t accidental. He thoroughly analyzed his enemies beforehand, ensuring absolute certainty before striking.

Li Shiming felt the spiritual energy within him surge with excitement. Since advancing to late-stage Qi Refinement, he hadn’t faced an opponent of equal standing. His time in this stage had been brief, and he’d encountered no worthy adversaries.

Seeing Senior Brother Du and the five Qi Refinement cultivators holding formation flags in five directions, he finally felt the thrill of a proper battle. Since entering the world of cultivation, opportunities for equal combat had been rare—most enemies were far stronger, forcing him to rely on tricks, explosives, corpse puppets, or schemes.

Today, he wanted to fight honorably, like a true cultivator.

"Holy Ice Sect, Du Bingyan!" Du Bingyan flew within fifty meters of Li Shiming, stowed his flying boat, activated a flight talisman, and announced himself with dignified composure.

Since Li Shiming hadn’t fled, he deserved this respect—to know who had killed him.

"Sky Sea Sect, Li Shiming," Li Shiming replied calmly, neither submissive nor arrogant.

From Du Bingyan, Li Shiming sensed the aura of ninth-level Qi Refinement and the sound of blood coursing through his veins—a sign of considerable body-refining achievement.

Li Shiming had heard rumors of genius cultivators in the Sky Sea Sect, but his circle mostly revolved around formation masters, leaving him unfamiliar with that elite world. He knew the standards for geniuses were extremely high—each sect had only a handful, with Sky Sea Sect counting theirs on one hand. This wasn’t due to lack of resources but the scarcity of qualifying talents. Even among these few, three were merely the best of the Dual Spiritual Roots disciples.

Genius cultivators were treasures of their sects, seeds for future Golden Core masters. The first genius Li Shiming had encountered was Baili Jinyan, whose strength he still couldn’t confidently match. Yin Shiran, despite her Heavenly Spirit Root, wasn’t officially a genius cultivator—her passion lay in formations, with cultivation serving that purpose. The sect nurtured geniuses for combat prowess, though Yin Shiran’s situation was special; Elder Yin provided her resources regardless.

These thoughts flashed through Li Shiming’s mind in an instant. His right hand summoned the Jade-Breaking Sword, while his left activated the Spirit Turtle Shield, enveloping him in protective light. Knowing his opponent was a genius cultivator, he dared not be careless.

Simultaneously, Du Bingyan clad himself in ice armor, a top-grade sword-type magical tool hovering beside him. Li Shiming no longer mistook such weapons for true flying swords after studying the *Ten Directions Sword Cultivation Art*. True sword cultivators dedicated their entire cultivation path to the sword, from techniques to weapons. Neither he nor Du Bingyan were sword cultivators—they merely wielded magical tools.

"Strike!" Du Bingyan attacked first. With a soft command, his top-grade sword shot toward Li Shiming.

Li Shiming’s Jade-Breaking Sword met it midair. Though inferior in quality, Li Shiming avoided direct clashes, instead making light, precise taps along the spine of Du Bingyan’s sword. Each contact disrupted its momentum, showcasing control that startled Du Bingyan—especially Li Shiming’s superior speed.

"How could he master the *Sword Control Art* to this degree?" Du Bingyan thought, alarmed.

In truth, Li Shiming’s current *Sword Control Art* level, even with IBMz15’s analysis, only matched Du Bingyan’s. Surpassing a top-tier Qi Refinement cultivator in sword control was nearly impossible. Li Shiming’s advantage came from his spiritual sense, enhancing the Jade-Breaking Sword’s agility beyond Du Bingyan’s weapon.

Despite the Holy Ice Sect’s resources, Du Bingyan lacked spiritual sense cultivation techniques or rare pills to generate it—precisely why he sought a Golden Core master’s patronage, as only they could provide such treasures.

With his sword’s rhythm disrupted, Du Bingyan couldn’t achieve maximum speed. Meanwhile, Li Shiming’s wings fluttered, keeping him perpetually a step ahead. Though he’d abandoned becoming a sword cultivator, their fighting style was exhilarating. Without even using the Spirit Turtle Shield’s defenses, his inferior sword suppressed Du Bingyan’s top-grade weapon.

Seeing his attacks ineffective, Du Bingyan slapped a talisman at his waist. Li Shiming, alert to his movements, accelerated to evade as the talisman unleashed a late-Qi Refinement spell—one Li Shiming didn’t recognize but sensed was powerful.

The air around him swirled violently, forming a blizzard that coated his body and wings in ice, slowing his movements. Yet the Spirit Turtle Shield blocked most effects, and the ice shattered easily—had it been at full strength, breaking free wouldn’t have been so simple.

Realizing Li Shiming’s formidable defense, Du Bingyan recalled his sword and channeled a surge of spiritual energy into it.

"Strike again!" This time, he abandoned finesse, leveraging his peak Qi Refinement cultivation to overpower Li Shiming. The sword gleamed blue as it shot forth.

Li Shiming’s Jade-Breaking Sword accelerated beyond normal *Sword Control Art* limits, its blade infused with a strange energy—a gift from his Sword Bone, enhancing speed and power in ways he didn’t fully understand.

Du Bingyan’s sword, despite its enhanced energy, couldn’t evade interception. Worse, each clash now sent tremors through his spirit, as the strange energy assailed his mental imprint on the weapon.

"Help me!" Du Bingyan abandoned pride, calling his five companions. Qi Refinement cultivators had limited techniques, and geniuses like him often specialized. His reliance on his sword left him helpless when it failed.

The five cultivators, stationed to trap Li Shiming with formation flags, hesitated—this wasn’t the one-sided beatdown they’d expected. But they advanced, drawing their weapons.

"Enough. Let’s end this." Disappointed at losing a chance for proper combat, Li Shiming sighed. Facing six opponents was unwise.

Du Bingyan, enraged at the dismissal, opened his mouth to retort—only to scream as a spiritual sense blade from *Jade Heart Ice Mind Art* pierced his mind. Before he could react, the Jade-Breaking Sword pierced his heart.

To Qi Refinement cultivators without spiritual sense, such attacks were undetectable and fatal. Li Shiming collected Du Bingyan’s corpse and weapons with a sweep of his spiritual sense, then turned to the remaining five.

His wings propelled him faster than they could flee. The Jade-Breaking Sword flashed—one cultivator’s mid-grade defensive tool shattered, his throat cut before he could blink. A second fell just as quickly.

"Run!" The survivors panicked, but Li Shiming’s speed sealed their fate. None escaped.
