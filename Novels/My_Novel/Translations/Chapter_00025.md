Chapter 25: He Is a Good Man, Encountering Demons on the Road

The old man surnamed Zhu forced a fawning smile, trying to look ingratiating. "This old man has caught a chill... *cough, cough*... I hope, Master, you can... forgive me."

Lying on the bed was a three- or five-year-old child, trembling under the quilt and looking at Li Xian and the others with fear.

The house was crude, but it could barely block the cold wind. However, when Zhao Dachun opened the large door, the cold wind swept into the room, and the warmth that had been barely gathered was instantly blown away.

Li Xian casually closed the door.

Only then did the coldness ease slightly. Zhao Dachun was taken aback and felt greatly displeased. *“This小子 is just making trouble. If we don’t freeze them a bit, how will they quickly pay the rent?”*

“*Cough, cough*.” Zhao Dachun looked around. “Where is your little Zhu? It’s deep winter, where is he hiding?”

The old man surnamed Zhu said sorrowfully, “My son... my son... was eaten by a mountain tiger. Only this old man and my grandson are left.”

“Dad! Dad, you died so tragically!” The child on the bed burst into tears.

“Good child, good child, don’t cry, don’t cry, *cough, cough*... We only have each other left, you still have Grandpa.” The old man hurried over to comfort his grandson.

“So that’s how it is.” Zhao Dachun laughed. “That’s quite pitiful. Last time I saw him, he was full of life. Who knew his life was so short? Dead can’t come back to life, hurry up and accept my condolences.”

Hearing such cold words, the grandfather and grandson felt even more grief in their hearts, but they didn’t dare to utter a word of rebuttal.

“However...”

“The man is dead, but the rent cannot be less. Trying to play the pitiful card with me is useless.”

“Quickly, if you have grain, pay with grain; if no grain, pay with money.”

Zhao Dachun said coldly.

“Yes... yes... We prepared it early, just waiting for you to come.” The old man took off his shoes and carefully took out a few copper coins.

“Your family rents ten mu of land. One mu requires half a shi of grain as tribute, so ten mu is five shi. Converted into silver... it’s two taels of silver.”

Zhao Dachun didn’t know a single character, but the conversion of money and grain was truly second nature to him.

“Yes... yes... This old man understands, I understand.”

The old man went to the bedside again, turned the pillow over, and took out a few pieces of broken silver from the inner seam.

He rummaged around the house and finally managed to gather two taels of silver. All his savings were drained.

“Alright, quite straightforward.” Zhao Dachun collected the rent, his eyes darting around, but he still didn't leave.

“Master... you...” The old man looked at him, confused.

“I traveled a long way to help you deliver the rent money, how is it? No running fee?” Zhao Dachun glared.

“This...” The old man was troubled. “But we really have nothing left. Just some grain for the winter, the grandfather and grandson are counting on it to get through the winter.”

“Nothing?” Zhao Dachun slapped the table and stood up in anger. “I think you just don’t want to pay! Fine, you ungrateful wretch, you think Zhao Dachun is easy to bully, huh?”

“Master, I’m wronged, Master.” The old man fell to his knees with a thud, begging humbly. “This old man kowtows to you, I really wouldn’t dare deceive you.”

“Wronged your fucking ass!” Zhao Dachun cursed. “Your son is dead, what do you need that burial money for? Why don’t you just...”

Just as he was speaking, a hand suddenly landed on his shoulder. Zhao Dachun knew it was Li Xian, and he happened to be quite dissatisfied with him, so he immediately cursed:

“I fuck your mother, I’ve held it in for a long time!” He shook his shoulder, trying to shake off Li Xian’s hand.

But Li Xian’s hand was like a suction cup.

“Good, you小子, you really think you’re something!?” Zhao Dachun’s internal energy surged, and he shook his shoulder again.

But he felt his internal energy vanish like mud entering the sea. Li Xian applied a little force, and his internal energy pressed down heavily.

Zhao Dachun’s face turned pale and then green, feeling a sharp pain inside.

*“This小子... his internal energy skill is actually higher than mine. Could it be... he has practiced a fist technique to the minor success stage!?”* Zhao Dachun exerted force to resist, his whole body trembling slightly.

He couldn't speak.

“Since the rent has been collected, don't waste time on meaningless matters.”

“Understand?”

Li Xian asked calmly.

Zhao Dachun nodded. Li Xian retracted his internal energy and let out a soft breath. Zhao Dachun felt as if a heavy burden was lifted and slumped onto a wooden chair.

After a moment to recover, he finally had the strength to curse:

“We are fellow guards, how about it? We talked quite well before, we were practically brothers. To offend a brother for a lowly peasant like that, I’ve never seen someone like you.”

Li Xian said coldly, “Since we are not on the same path, there is no need to save face. Let’s go.”

Zhao Dachun rushed out the door, cursing his bad luck for being grouped with Li Xian.

Li Xian was also about to leave when he suddenly saw the grandfather and grandson, as thin as firewood. One lost a father early in life, the other lost a son in old age; it was extremely desolate.

He took two dry cakes from his body and tossed them to the grandfather and grandson.

Without saying a word, he turned and left.

“The world is treacherous; I am no sage. I cannot help everyone.”

“But doing what I can within my power, and having a clear conscience, isn't that difficult.”

Li Xian strode away. While going along with the world, he could still have his own support.

Blind kindness is not advisable; regarding the scale of it, Li Xian had his own considerations.

The grandfather and grandson leaned against the window, watching the figure in the wind and snow.

This guard master... seemed a bit different.

There were over a hundred households in Changshou Village. By the time the rent was collected, it was already near evening.

The group gathered at the village head, eating some dry rations and drinking clear water, preparing to return the way they came.

“Brother Zhao, what’s wrong? You look unhappy. Didn’t you collect the running fee?”

Qiao Dashou saw Zhao Dachun in a bad mood and, out of curiosity, went over to ask.

“Sigh, I met the wrong person, nothing to say.” Zhao Dachun grumbled, waving his hand.

“Not to criticize you, but you’re too greedy. You actually dared to keep the running fee all to yourself.”

“Yeah, this isn’t according to the rules. Brother Zhao, don’t worry, we’ll back you up.”

The other guards understood immediately and all looked at Li Xian.

Feng Huo frowned. “New guy, the running fee is at least split 70-30, there’s never been a case of keeping it all. You should have given him a little something.”

Zhao Dachun grumbled, “Give what? I didn’t even collect the running fee.”

“Didn’t collect?” Everyone was dumbfounded. Zhao Dachun explained the reason in detail. After hearing it, when they looked at Li Xian again, it was as if they were looking at a freak.

They all took a step back unconsciously.

Li Xian ignored it, not caring in the slightest.

Collecting the “running fee” was an unspoken rule, also a way for guards to make extra money. He knew what he was doing and the consequences.

“Alright, let’s just leave it at that.”

“It’s getting dark, let’s hurry back to the manor.”

Feng Huo looked at the sky, unwilling to dwell on the matter, and led the group back the way they came.

After walking seven or eight li, they passed by the side of a mountain. Whether it was because the mountain was high and the wind was strong, or because the Yin energy was thick.

Upon reaching this place, the wind and snow grew even heavier, and the road was difficult to walk.

By now, the sky had darkened, and the wind and snow were fierce, stinging their faces as they blew. Feng Huo walked at the front, previously urging them on from time to time, but at some point, he stopped talking.

That D-rank guard named Ye Xiaoluo suddenly went weak in the legs and fell to the ground.

“You bastard, you’re always holding us back!”

“New guy, you have good stamina, carry him on your back.”

Feng Huo said with a hint of anxiety.

But Li Xian frowned and looked around. “Guard Feng... did you hear footsteps?”

“Nonsense! We are a few big men, of course there are footsteps when we walk.” Feng Huo cursed.

But Li Xian could see that Feng Huo was afraid. When the wind and snow grew heavy, he became afraid. He must have encountered something in the wind and snow before.

At this moment... he was clearly worried about something, but he didn't mention it to the others.

“My hearing is sharp. I clearly heard footsteps, not from our eight people.”

“Something... has followed us from behind. With Feng Huo’s experience, he should be able to give some advice. But he’s pretending to relax, pretending not to know...”

“This means he prioritizes self-preservation. If I’m not mistaken, he might find an excuse to run.” Li Xian narrowed his eyes.

Just as expected.

“Damn it, I drank too much water earlier, I really need to pee. You guys wait here, I’m going to take a leak.” Feng Huo cursed.

“Prioritize self-preservation...” Li Xian scanned the crowd and shouted exaggeratedly, “Oh no, I need to pee too, Master Feng, wait for me!”
