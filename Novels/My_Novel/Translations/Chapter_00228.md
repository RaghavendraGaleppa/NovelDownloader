Chapter 228: Capturing the Madam Alive, a Beauty in Distress

Wen Caishang had always looked down upon the Four Heroes of Taixin, regretting deeply that she hadn't pursued them with her life on the line back then. Recalling today's events, a sorrowful expression crossed her face. "I schemed for the Earth Essence, and now I reap the consequences. Every decision I made seemed to push me deeper into the abyss."

"To be in such a situation, I fear I will truly fall here. A clean death would be better than suffering humiliation at their hands."

She suddenly raised her sword to slash her own throat.

The Tiger, his resentment and anger yet to be vented, was both overjoyed and terrified to see Wen Caishang attempting suicide. He was delighted that the woman had finally reached a dead end. He was terrified that she would die, robbing him of the pleasure of tormenting her. A thousand thoughts raced through his mind, and he shouted, "Pounce on her!"

Ignoring the danger, he lunged forward, man and tiger together, to grab the sword. A sharp glint flashed in Wen Caishang's eyes, her sorrowful expression vanishing instantly. She sneered, "You废物, do you think I, Wen Caishang, would commit suicide? You underestimate me too much. It is you who will lose your life!"

She reversed the sword's edge, turning a defensive move into a lethal strike aimed at the Tiger.

By now, Wen Caishang's swordplay had no Qi, its power less than a tenth of what it once was. Yet, her sword technique was cunning and exquisitely precise, embodying the principle of using a point to break a surface, and using skill to overcome brute force. This was amplified by the White Snake Sword's peerless sharpness.

The Tiger's heart trembled with fear. He cursed inwardly, *Vixen, I've fallen for her trick again!* He executed his "Monument-Splitting Iron Hand" to block her. A dark luster shimmered on his arms, making them as hard as black iron.

Wen Caishang sneered. The sword tip, agile as a snake, dodged the iron hands. First, it severed the tiger beast's front claws, then followed through to slash at the man's neck.

The Dog Warrior shouted, "Vixen, watch my finger!" Riding his strange hound, he pointed with both fingers.

His mind worked the same as the Tiger's. For such a peerless beauty to die would be a way to avenge their shame, but an indescribable reluctance would remain in his heart.

He charged at the same time.

Wen Caishang had no Qi and was covered in injuries, making it impossible for her to handle both. She was struck in the shoulder by the two fingers, and her arms went numb instantly. She felt a powerful surge of Qi flood her body, blocking her acupoints and sealing her meridians.

"You vile villain, you intend to capture me alive!" Wen Caishang was furious. She gritted her silver teeth and cursed, "Seeking death!" While her limbs were still free, she swung her sword back to stab.

With a噗嗤 sound, the sword pierced through his chest, cutting his heart meridian. However, without Qi to power the killing blow, he survived. The Dog Warrior pulled back, narrowly escaping death, his heart still pounding.

Wen Caishang's eyes narrowed slightly. She treated them both equally, flicking the White Snake Sword. The blade suddenly extended several feet, wounding the Tiger as well. After executing this move, her delicate brows furrowed tightly, her face turning pale. She felt a heaviness in her shoulders, and her body could no longer move.

A perilous exchange of blows, yet she had failed to kill any of them.

A moment later, the Dog Warrior laughed in delight. "Excellent, excellent! My life-risking finger jab was not in vain. The renowned Madam of the Broken Sword has actually been captured by us four brothers!"

He laughed heartily. "Brother Tiger, she's been hit by my 'Marrow-Still Point.' She can't move easily. Hahaha, tie her up quickly, so we can torment her to our hearts' content!"

"Despicable!" Wen Caishang struggled to move.

Her bones, acupoints, and meridians were all bound by a powerful Qi, pinning her in place. She knew the method to undo the point, but with her Qi completely depleted, she couldn't施展 it.

"Gentlemen."

A low voice suddenly spoke. It was Li Xian.

"Who?!" The area was a mess of carnage.

The Deer Warrior was dead, the Python Warrior was a broken wreck, and the Tiger and Dog Warriors were on the brink of death. Wen Caishang was severely injured and unable to move.

Li Xian said, "I am a disciple of the Sword Rain Pavilion. My name is Lin Li."

Dusk was falling.

Li Xian had been hiding in the shadows, observing for a long time. The five of them had fought so fiercely that the casualties were shocking. They had completely forgotten about his presence.

During the intense battle, Li Xian had pretended to flee, running far away, but no one had paid him any attention.

Li Xian thought, *I'll pretend to be a disciple of the Sword Rain Pavilion first. If I can fool them, that's for the best. If I'm seen through, I'll think of another plan.*

He smeared his face with dirt. Following the style of the Sword Rain Pavilion disciples, he carried his sword on his back. With the cover of twilight, he did look quite similar.

He returned openly, brazenly pretending to be one of them. His hastily conceived plan was full of flaws, but no one saw through it.

"Pah!" the Tiger Warrior roared in anger. "A bunch of bastards! You said you'd come to help, but we haven't seen a single shadow. We four brothers fought for our lives, and now you want to swoop in and claim the prize? No way!"

Li Xian thought, *So they were ambushing here after making an agreement beforehand, but the Sword Rain Pavilion broke their promise. It seems the Sword-Seeking Alliance has its own schemes and isn't very harmonious.* He said, "You misunderstand, senior!"

"The Sword Rain Pavilion had no such intention. This junior has always admired you. Now that this villainous woman has been captured by you, the credit is yours no matter what."

"The Sword Rain Pavilion would never dare to covet it!"

"This junior, Lin Li, must congratulate you both. From today on, your names will be renowned far and wide!"

"Which martial artist in the Jianghu would dare not to look at you with new respect?"

The Tiger and Dog Warriors were greatly pleased, their minds overjoyed. They both thought, *Brother Deer and Brother Python did not die in vain.*

The Tiger Warrior laughed aloud. "Then what 'Four Heroes of Taixin'? From now on, there are only the Two Titans of Taixin!"

*You call each other brothers, but I see little true friendship between you,* Li Xian thought sarcastically.

Li Xian said, "But this vixen's methods are unpredictable, and her grudge against us is deep. We don't know what tricks she has left. We should capture her quickly to put a final end to this!"

"What you say makes sense!" the Tiger Warrior said.

Li Xian said, "The Sword Rain Pavilion has a special rope. Please, seniors, use this to bind her! Once the final step is complete, there will be no more Madam of the Broken Sword in the Jianghu, only the Two Titans of Taixin, whose names will shake the world and command respect from all directions!"

"To be honest, when I was in the Sword Rain Pavilion, I often heard the elders speak of the Four Heroes of Taixin, but their评价 was biased and full of prejudice. Before today, my impression of you two seniors was just average. But right now, the great feat you two have accomplished is enough to silence all doubt!"

The Tiger and Dog nodded, feeling a sense of exhilaration. "Hmph, that Elder Su Qiuwu of yours said he'd come to help, but he never showed up. In the end, not even a junior like you could see things clearly."

The Tiger's eyes flashed. He muttered, "This woman is too厉害. Even though she can't move, we don't know if she has any more tricks. This kid came at the perfect time. Let him be the one to tie her up and be our scapegoat."

He then said, "Kid, you go and tie up that woman."

"After this is done, we'll count you in for the credit of capturing Wen Caishang alive. Such a beauty, do you want a taste?"

Li Xian quickly said, "To be honest with you two seniors, I... I really do."

"Hahahaha!" the Dog Warrior said. "A real man should speak his mind. If you said you didn't, I'd look down on you."

"Go on. Tie up this villainous woman properly. After my brother and I have had our fill of fun, we'll naturally give you a chance to enjoy yourself too."

"You dare!" Wen Caishang was furious. She thought, *These two beasts are treating me like a prize to be distributed as they please. I... I... I truly have no methods left. Could it be that I must...*

Her pupils trembled. Having lost all her strength, she could no longer maintain her usual calm and composure.

"Hahaha, what's there to not dare?" the Tiger Warrior laughed heartily. "For the great Madam of the Broken Sword to fall to such a state, will surely be a wonderful spectacle!"

He shouted, "Kid, hurry up!"

Li Xian pretended to be hesitant and nervous. The Dog Warrior cursed in impatience, "You cowardly bastard! If you don't go, I'll劈了你!"

Li Xian said, "Alright, I'm going." He held the silken rope. The Tiger Warrior said, "I need to watch your technique. You must be extremely careful. You need to tie this vixen up so she can't move at all."

Li Xian said, "I will do my best." He walked over slowly.

Wen Caishang stood motionless, her body trembling slightly, feeling utterly helpless. Li Xian sighed inwardly, *The Madam is also human. When faced with a desperate situation, she will naturally feel fear.*

Wen Caishang couldn't turn around. Li Xian was behind her, so she couldn't see him. She cursed resentfully, "You little servant, if you dare touch me, I'll have you killed instantly!"

Li Xian held the rope, about to touch Wen Caishang. Suddenly, he saw her sleeve move. His heart turned cold, and he almost died right there. *I appeared so suddenly, even the Madam was fooled. She wanted to use that silkworm to bite me.*

*The Tiger and Dog are foolish and reckless, so it's natural they were deceived by me. But the Madam is wise and cunning...*

*In the end, she only trusts herself. She judges others by herself, so she subconsciously overlooked the possibility that I would come to save her. Or perhaps... in her desperation, she couldn't be bothered to think about my life or death.*

Li Xian didn't dare touch her directly. He threw the silken rope first, wrapping it around Wen Caishang's wrists. Wen Caishang raged, *This家伙 is cautious. Did he discover the ancestral silkworm?* Then she was stunned. She felt something slippery on her wrist; the texture of the rope was very similar to her silkworm rope.

She finally understood. *I was so angry I lost my head. I didn't even think of this. This disciple from the Sword Rain Pavilion is Li Xian in disguise!*

She suppressed her killing intent, feeling a slight thought. The ancestral silkworm retreated into her sleeve. Li Xian knew they had recognized each other. With the two of them watching like tigers, it was hard to fool them. Li Xian tied her up for real, pulling her hands behind her back and binding her wrists.

Li Xian said, "What a figure, what a figure," and roamed his hands freely. Wen Caishang was furious, but she knew Li Xian was intentionally lowering their guard.

Blushing, she played along and cursed, "You little bastard, you dare touch me?! If you dare touch me, I'll chop your hands off when I get free!"

Li Xian didn't stop his hands. "Hmph, you vixen, now that you've been captured by these two seniors, you still dare to act arrogant with me? What's wrong with me touching you?"

Wen Caishang's chest heaved. She had long lost her composure and for a moment couldn't tell if Li Xian was acting or being real. A bit of anger flared in her heart. "Insolent, do you want to die?"

Li Xian said, "Vixen, even if you have heaven-shaking abilities, you must obey orders now!"

Wen Caishang roared, "You... bastard! Villain!" Although she knew it was an act, she felt that Li Xian was truly beyond her control at this moment. Her reaction was a mix of acting and genuine feeling.

Li Xian said, "It seems I need to show you my power."

"Ah! Be gentler."

"Hmph, you vixen. If I'm gentle, I'd be letting you out to harm people?"

The Dog and Tiger warriors listened, their minds wandering, their blood rushing.

Li Xian's hands moved swiftly, weaving the ropes and binding her without hesitation.

Wen Caishang was both angry and ashamed. She was used to wearing the silkworm garment, but being captured was a first. The humiliation and powerlessness in her heart, the panic and helplessness—she had long lost her former elegance, but this added a different kind of charm.

She also deliberately acted with Li Xian, mixing truth and falsehood, her cheeks flushed red.

Soon, Wen Caishang's wrists and ankles were tightly bound, her entire body wrapped in the silken ropes. Li Xian picked her up.

Li Xian said, "Seniors, the vixen is tied up."

"Good, good!" the two said with delight.

Li Xian said, "You two seniors seem to be seriously injured. There is a large city ahead. Why not enter the city and find an inn to rest?"

"When the time comes, you seniors can enjoy this woman. After you've had your fill, I hope you'll grant me some of the leftover soup, so this little brother can also have a taste."

Wen Caishang's delicate brows furrowed deeply. She was extremely displeased. Li Xian's words were incredibly disrespectful. Then she thought again, *If what Li Xian says is true, then I... I am truly without hope!* Her heart tightened.

The Tiger and Dog warriors were extremely hesitant, but seeing Wen Caishang's panicked expression, which was definitely not an act, they nodded and laughed. "Let's go!"

The Tiger's legs were severed, and his tiger beast was dead, so he could only walk on his hands, upside down. The Dog's heart meridian was damaged, his injuries were severe, and he walked with a limp.

Li Xian, carrying Wen Caishang, walked ahead.
