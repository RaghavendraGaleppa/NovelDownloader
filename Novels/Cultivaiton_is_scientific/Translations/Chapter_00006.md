# Chapter 6 Poisoning  

Li Shiming entered the garden. Though he didn't see Chief Escort Wang, he knew with certainty that the man was watching him.  

He arrived at the designated meeting spot by the rockery. The sky had darkened slightly, and the surrounding plants cast faint shadows.  

"Chief Escort Wang, I've brought the medicine!" he said, setting down the food box.  

"Young master truly keeps his word!" Chief Escort Wang emerged from behind the rockery with a faint smile.  

His face was even paler than during the day, indicating his injuries were more severe than Li Shiming had imagined.  

Li Shiming opened the food box, revealing a large bowl of medicine inside.  

Chief Escort Wang inhaled deeply, his expression turning satisfied.  

As a seasoned veteran, he could judge the medicine's authenticity with just a sniff. He had chosen Li Shiming precisely because the young man, though intelligent, was essentially a blank slate—a bookish young master unlikely to resist under threat.  

Given Li Shiming's social circle and the fact that the prefect's household only had two masters—the prefect and his son—it was improbable that he had any exposure to unsavory dealings. Chief Escort Wang doubted Li Shiming could even acquire poison if he tried.  

While Li Shiming could easily purchase other items, no one would dare sell poison to the prefect's son. The consequences would be dire if anything went wrong.  

Moreover, with Chief Escort Wang's experience, no poison could escape his nose—a skill he had specially trained for. Without the ability to detect toxins, how could he have survived escort missions? He would have been drugged long ago.  

Indeed, the bowl of medicine was completely untainted, brewed strictly according to Chief Escort Wang's prescription using the finest ingredients.  

Li Shiming took the bowl from the food box and handed it to Chief Escort Wang.  

"Chief Escort Wang, I've done as you asked. When will you give me the antidote?" he asked gravely.  

Chief Escort Wang was pleased with Li Shiming's attitude—this reverence for life was exactly what he wanted.  

"Brew this medicine twice more tomorrow. Tomorrow night, I'll give you the antidote," Chief Escort Wang replied, accepting the bowl with a faint smile.  

"I hope you keep your word!" Li Shiming said with a grimace.  

With that, he picked up the food box and turned to leave, seemingly angry at not receiving the antidote.  

In truth, he was worried that if Chief Escort Wang began to succumb to the poison, he might still have enough strength to kill him in retaliation. His quick departure was purely for self-preservation.  

The moment he handed the bowl to Chief Escort Wang, Li Shiming had retrieved abrin—the toxin from rosary peas—from his machine room space and emptied every last bit of it into the medicine.  

Since the abrin was directly deposited inside the bowl without immediately mixing with the medicine, its presence remained undetectable to Chief Escort Wang.  

Moreover, the amount of abrin was minuscule compared to the volume of the medicine, and it had no discernible odor. Even if it had been openly added, Chief Escort Wang would likely have missed it.  

The so-called ability to detect poison came from familiarity with known toxins—their scents and characteristics. But abrin was unprecedented in this world, rendering such detection methods useless.  

Li Shiming quickened his pace, putting distance between himself and Chief Escort Wang.  

Chief Escort Wang, eager to heal, raised the bowl and gulped down the medicine.  

His injuries were severe, and he had been relying on temporary remedies while waiting for this secret healing concoction to take effect.  

As the medicine entered his system, he felt the familiar warmth of its healing properties.  

But soon, his breathing became labored, his body trembled uncontrollably, and his temperature skyrocketed.  

"Poison!" Chief Escort Wang tried to speak, but the words caught in his throat.  

Already weakened by his injuries, his body quickly succumbed to the abrin—administered at twenty times the lethal dose for an average person.  

Excruciating abdominal pain and muscle spasms left him immobile.  

Chief Escort Wang thought of Li Shiming's delicate, scholarly face. He couldn't believe that a veteran like him had been poisoned by a mere scholar, a pampered young master—especially when he had been on guard.  

Overwhelmed by humiliation and unwillingness to accept defeat, he struggled to regain control of his body.  

His internal energy surged wildly, attempting to expel the toxin, but he didn't even know what poison he had ingested, let alone how to counteract it.  

To hasten the medicine's absorption, he had initially accelerated its digestion with his internal energy. Now, it was too late to expel the toxin.  

Unable to breathe, his face turned purple.  

Li Shiming stood behind a tree twenty meters away. Enhanced by his heightened senses, he could still make out Chief Escort Wang's condition in the dim moonlight.  

When Chief Escort Wang collapsed from the poison, Li Shiming didn't approach immediately. He waited silently.  

The abrin he had prepared, according to the information he had, was a toxin easily absorbed by the body. Unless the victim was in a top-tier modern hospital with precise knowledge of the poison, survival was impossible.  

In his final moments, Chief Escort Wang still couldn't comprehend why Li Shiming had been so resolute—willing to perish together with him.  

He had personally watched Li Shiming swallow the Three-Day Soul-Severing Pill. As he had said, aside from the unique antidote, no physician could cure it in time.  

With confusion and resentment, Chief Escort Wang drew his last breath.  

Li Shiming remained still, observing from behind the tree.  

Only after confirming that Chief Escort Wang's chest hadn't risen for a full ten minutes did he finally accept the man's death.  

Cautiously, he approached the corpse, maintaining vigilance the entire time. With a seasoned veteran like this, he couldn't afford even the slightest carelessness.  

Looking at Chief Escort Wang's twisted, agonized expression, Li Shiming felt a wave of nausea.  

In his past life, he had been an ordinary person. In this life, he was a scholar. Neither had exposed him to corpses. That he hadn't vomited yet was already impressive.  

After all, this was his first kill. For a first-timer, he was remarkably composed.  

Using a nearby branch, he searched Chief Escort Wang's body.  

Aside from a sword and some loose silver, the man carried nothing else.  

Li Shiming knew the immortal cultivator wouldn't have targeted Chief Escort Wang without reason.  

Nor would the cultivator have massacred seven escorts at Tianxiang Tower for no cause.  

From the case records, he knew immortal cultivators rarely committed such acts. The Southern Mound Prefecture had no records of such incidents in decades.  

The authorities suspected Chief Escort Wang possessed something the immortal cultivator desired, which had brought about his doom.  

Li Shiming had wanted to kill Chief Escort Wang not only to prevent him from harming the prefect's household in a fit of madness but also out of curiosity for whatever the immortal cultivator had sought.  

Now that Chief Escort Wang was dead but the object remained unfound, Li Shiming couldn't help but feel disappointed.
