# Chapter 7: Flowing Cloud Market

After practicing the Fireball Spell to proficiency, Zhao Di once again sought out Uncle-Master Li at the Transmission Hall. This time, for some reason, there weren't many people, allowing him to consult with Uncle-Master Li for most of the afternoon, yielding considerable gains. Not only did he acquire the incantation for another defensive spell—the "Adamantine Shield," a metal-element spell—but he also verified some insights he gained during his Fireball Spell practice. Uncle-Master Li even shared some small tips on spell usage, which greatly benefited Zhao Di.

In this manner, Zhao Di spent over half a year learning four or five elementary Qi Condensation Stage spells that he could master. Then, he began to consider learning talisman crafting.

Drawing requires at least three tools: paper, brush, and pigment. Similarly, crafting talismans requires three indispensable items: talisman paper, a talisman brush, and cinnabar.

Ordinary paper in the mortal world possesses no spiritual energy and cannot withstand it, thus it cannot be used as talisman paper. Talisman paper is typically made from spirit-infused plants like Seven-Star Grass.

The talisman brush, of course, is ideally a spiritual item as well; at the very least, its bristles are usually made from the manes of spiritual beasts. As for cinnabar, it is refined from the spiritual blood of low-level spiritual beasts.

Zhao Di possessed none of these items. The only thing he had was the designs for several low-level talismans that he'd seen in a book called "Incomplete Basic Talisman Manual" from the Scripture Depository. Zhao Di had long since begun repeatedly practicing the graphical runes on the talismans with ordinary paper and brush, having them memorized backwards and forwards.

These three items were not rare in the cultivation world; many people in the Jian family possessed them. After inquiring for a while, Zhao Di set his sights on Jian Li, an eight or nine-year-old child.

One of Jian Li's paternal uncles held a mid-level position within the Jian family, and this uncle was particularly fond of crafting talismans. He would certainly have these low-level talisman crafting tools. Jian Li was currently only at the third level of the Qi Condensation Stage, a time when he needed a large quantity of low-level elixirs to advance his cultivation. Zhao Di offered three Qi Gathering Powders in exchange for Jian Li to help him acquire some low-level talisman paper and cinnabar, and to lend him a talisman brush for a short period.

Jian Li agreed almost without hesitation. His uncle usually doted on him the most, and exchanging for the lowest-level talisman paper and cinnabar would definitely not be an issue. As for borrowing the talisman brush, he wasn't so sure.

A few days later, Jian Li proactively found Zhao Di, handing him two dozen low-level talisman papers, a small bottle containing a small amount of cinnabar, and a talisman brush that looked quite ordinary. Finally, he added that if Zhao Di needed more, he could exchange again, and the next exchange would still be three Qi Gathering Powders.

Zhao Di could only smile bitterly. These few Qi Gathering Powders were what he had accumulated by pausing his cultivation. He could only receive one per month, and the Qi Gathering Powders from the past half-year had all been used up. How could he afford to exchange for more?

...

About half a year later, on the day Zhao Di turned fifteen, he received a package as scheduled. Inside were two defensive Adamantine Talismans and three egg-sized stones of various colors. The next day, Zhao Di, along with his package, was "invited out" of the Nanhua Mountain Valley.

At this point, Zhao Di's entire possessions consisted of the package bestowed by the family before his departure, a dozen talismans he had personally crafted, a small dagger-shaped low-grade magical artifact, and a small medicine bottle that Jian Xin'er had insisted on giving him before he left, containing seven or eight Qi Gathering Powders.

Jian Xin'er was already at the eighth level of the Qi Condensation Stage, one of the core disciples of the family. She no longer had use for such low-level spiritual medicines, so these must have been specially prepared for Zhao Di. Thinking of this, Zhao Di accepted them without much protest.

Speaking of Jian Xin'er, she had truly grown up with him as a childhood companion. He remembered when she was two or three years old, newly brought into the Jian family, she would miss her parents every night and struggle to sleep. It was thanks to Zhao Di telling her stories every night that she was coaxed to sleep.

To Jian Xin'er, this young "big brother" who wasn't much older than her could endlessly tell many interesting stories: the Yellow Emperor's battle with Chiyou, the Goddess Nuwa mending the heavens and creating humans, and so on—all things she had never heard before. This continued for over a year until both of them began cultivating immortal arts. In Jian Xin'er's eyes, this "Brother Five Roots" was undoubtedly her closest kin.

Later, Zhao Di focused on his cultivation, and his interactions with this little sister became increasingly infrequent. After that, because Jian Xin'er possessed excellent aptitude and cultivated quickly, she was specially groomed by the Jian family elders as a core disciple. Zhao Di saw her even less often; although they were in the same valley, it was rare for them to meet even once every year or two.

Every time this young girl saw Zhao Di, she would pull on his arm, ceaselessly calling out "Brother Five Roots, Brother Five Roots," which always brought a touch of warmth to Zhao Di's heart, accustomed as he was to being mocked by others.

Jian Xin'er praised his talent in talisman crafting, and it truly had some truth to it. The first time Zhao Di attempted to craft a Fireball Talisman, he succeeded after only a dozen failures, and his success rate thereafter never dropped below twenty percent. He actually ended up crafting five or six Fireball Talismans. Later, he simply used all his Qi Gathering Powders to exchange for more talisman paper and continued practicing the creation of Fireball Talismans and Adamantine Talismans. After wasting over a hundred sheets of talisman paper in total, he finally succeeded in crafting two Adamantine Talismans and over a dozen Fireball Talismans. He was extremely satisfied with this result. His success rate was already much higher than what was rumored, leading him to wonder if the rumors were exaggerated or if he truly had some talent in talisman crafting.

He had no more time to practice these two types of talismans to greater proficiency, as he had already reached the age limit for "outward training," which was truly helpless.

If he were to ask Jian Xin'er to intercede for him, given how doted upon she was in the Jian family, there would be a high chance of him being able to stay in the family for a little longer. But Zhao Di refused to do so. He subtly resisted Jian Xin'er's help; such assistance made him feel useless, as if he still needed the protection of a young girl.

His current plan was to quickly reach a gathering place for cultivators in the northern part of Ganzhou, known as the "Flowing Cloud Market."

The Flowing Cloud Market was jointly managed by the nearby Liu family, Yun family, two cultivation families, and the small Lihuo Sect. This market was primarily open to young cultivators in the low and mid-levels of the Qi Condensation Stage for trading items. Zhao Di intended to craft and sell talismans there, and if he had a surplus, he could purchase some elixirs to improve his cultivation.

From Nanhua Mountain Valley to Flowing Cloud Market was a distance of over two thousand kilometers, passing through many places, all of which Zhao Di had clearly memorized.

Now, he arrived at a mountainside on the outskirts of Nanhua Mountain. Zhao Di had already walked for an entire day. Two paths lay before him: one was shorter. After crossing the small mountain in front of him, he would enter a large forest. He would have to walk through the forest for three or four days, then cross several small hills before exiting the Nanhua Mountain Range. At his current speed, if he traveled by day and rested at night, it would take about seven or eight days.

However, this forest was not simple. In the Jian family's ancient texts in the Scripture Depository, several mentions were made of this forest occasionally having low-level demonic beasts, and even a second-level demonic beast, a One-Horned Kui Ox, measuring seven or eight meters in length, had appeared there. Although over the years, the Jian family's high-level cultivators had almost completely eradicated the nearby demonic beasts, given their strong reproductive abilities, no one could guarantee that some low-level demonic beasts didn't still remain somewhere.

There was no unified theory in the cultivation world regarding how these terrifying demonic beasts came to be. Some said that ordinary wild beasts, insects, and birds, after living for extended periods in places with particularly abundant spiritual energy, or after consuming spiritual herbs and items, mutated and transformed into species possessing spiritual power.

Another portion of cultivators believed that demonic beasts existed in ancient times when heaven and earth were first separated and chaos began, even before the appearance of humans. Moreover, these ancient demonic beasts were extraordinarily powerful, and current demonic beasts merely inherited a very small portion of the ancient demonic beast bloodline.

Regardless of the theory, what was certain was that demonic beasts not only possessed spiritual power similar to cultivators but could also cultivate and grow according to their instincts. Even their cultivation realm divisions were quite similar to human cultivators.

Based on the strength of their spiritual power, demonic beasts could be divided into levels one through seven. Level one demonic beasts corresponded to human Qi Condensation Stage cultivators, levels two to four corresponded to early, mid, and late Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators, and levels five to seven corresponded to human Core Formation Stage cultivators.

Rumor had it that there were even demonic beasts above level seven, but they were never detailed in the Jian family's ancient texts. Such high-level demonic beasts were presumably beyond the reach of a small cultivation family like the Jians.

While demonic beasts' intelligence was inferior to human cultivators, they often possessed innate powerful divine abilities or incredibly sturdy bodies resembling steel and iron, making their strength no less than human cultivators of the same level. Some types of demonic beasts even possessed strength far superior to human cultivators of the same level.

However, every year, many cultivators daringly ventured into hidden demonic beast habitats to hunt various demonic beasts.

A small portion of these cultivators ultimately died in the jaws and claws of demonic beasts; naturally, even more low-level demonic beasts perished as a result. But with the strong reproductive abilities of demonic beasts, given even a short period, they could reproduce numerous offspring.

The reason cultivators were willing to risk their lives, rushing forth to hunt them, was driven by immense profit, because for cultivators, every part of a demonic beast was a treasure.

Any demonic beast above Level two would cultivate something called an inner core within its body, similar to a human cultivator's dantian. One could say that a demonic beast's spiritual power cultivation was almost entirely contained within this inner core; once the inner core was lost, not only would the demonic beast's cultivation be completely gone, but it would also likely lose its life.

For human cultivators, this inner core was an extremely precious item. Not only could it be used to refine magical artifacts and even magic treasures, but elixirs made primarily from inner cores were also important means for cultivators to improve their cultivation or break through bottlenecks.

Not just the inner core, but many parts of a demonic beast's body—such as its horns, scales, and claws—were usually incredibly tough or naturally possessed some incredible divine abilities, which could be used to refine magical artifacts or even magic treasures.

There were dozens of books in the Scripture Depository specifically discussing matters related to demonic beasts, demonstrating the vast variety of demonic beasts and how much cultivators valued them.
