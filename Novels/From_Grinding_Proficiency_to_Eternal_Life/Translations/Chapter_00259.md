# Chapter 259: Primordial Origin

The Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane swept forth, carrying with it a gale of flaming vital energy. Zhou Tianyan stumbled backward, his retreat broken, when he suddenly bit the tip of his tongue. The Nine Poles Sect's secret technique, "Nine Poles Burning Stars," erupted instantly. The blood energy and force within his body combined, exploding into seven rings of crimson fire around his physique.

Xu Yunfan did not evade or avoid, letting the龙鳞甲 (dragon scale armor) clank and ring as he forcefully crushed the scorching fire rings into a sky full of sparks.

Xu Yunfan's eyes blazed with golden light. The red cane drew a circle in the air, causing its shadow to split into nine afterimages, forcing Zhou Tianyan to retreat repeatedly. Finally, Xu Yunfan hooked his foot and flung him toward the high platform.

Zhou Tianyan was horrified. The records of his sect mentioned this white jade platform; it could absorb a person's essence.

"No!"

The surface of the white jade platform suddenly rippled with strange waves. The moment Zhou Tianyan landed, the platform surface surfaced with dense, tadpole-like curse characters. The Xuan Tortoise Treasure Armor on his chest actually disassembled itself, transforming into pure blood energy that seeped into the cracks of the jade bricks.

Zhou Tianyan's pupils contracted violently. He clearly felt his entire body's blood energy frantically leaking through his pores.

As the chief disciple of the Heavenly Authority Peak of the Nine Poles Sect, the "Nine Poles Swallowing Qi Technique" he had cultivated since childhood should have made his blood energy as stable as a furnace. Yet now, it was like a dragon whose pool had been drained, unable to move even a fingertip.

"The Master's message was a trap!"

This thought crept up his spine like a venomous snake biting his heart. Back when the Seven Great Sects joined forces to explore the Celestial White Jade Palace, only the Nine Poles Sect had, unknown to the world, sent out a person who recorded the situation inside.

Before departing, the Master had specially bestowed the Xuan Tortoise Treasure Armor. Now, it had turned into thousands of blood threads钻入 (drilling into) the cracks of the jade platform. How was this a protective treasure? It was clearly a prepared blood offering!

A gurgling sound came from his throat. His vigorous blood energy rampaged through his flesh and blood, trying to break free, but it was like mud cows entering the sea—there was no reaction at all.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his fellow sect brothers being kicked up onto the platform by Xu Yunfan one by one, their flesh collapsing in an instant. He suddenly remembered a sentence from the secret records of the White Jade Palace: "Feeding the Star Lord with blood can open the Heavenly Gate."

Every hair on his body stood on end.

The so-called secret realm opportunity was actually to allow a person who fell two thousand years ago to be reborn using the blood essence of martial artists.

Was the person who walked out of the White Jade Palace really a disciple of the Nine Poles Sect?!

Those deliberately erased sect records, those precise calculations of the White Jade Palace's location—now, they all turned into piercing coldness seeping into his bone marrow.

"No... it shouldn't be like this..."

Zhou Tianyan frantically urged the wisp of Burning Star true energy planted in his meridians by the Sect Master, only to find that even this wisp of true energy was flowing along the blood lines toward the stone seat.

When he saw the mysterious man's pale fingertips twitch slightly, he finally understood that he was the most insignificant sacrificial offering in some terrifying behind-the-scenes scheme.

"This... a variant of the Source Ancient Jade Wall, Blood Sacrifice Jade!"

Su Zhenhe suddenly exclaimed in the distance.

The remaining Nine Poles disciples had yet to react when Xu Yunfan flashed behind them like a ghost. With a light tap of the red cane on the vital acupoints of their backs, he threw all of them onto the high platform.

In an instant, the entire White Jade Platform shone with green light. The dragon eyes of the thirty-six dragon-winding pillars simultaneously lit up with scarlet light.

The martial artists thrown onto the high platform screamed as they curled into balls. Fine blood droplets seeped from their pores, following the patterns of the curse runes on the jade bricks, converging into nine winding blood rivers that surged toward the central stone seat.

The veins on the neck of the man on the stone seat bulged slightly once, then vanished in a flash.

Xu Yunfan, who had been watching closely, felt his hair stand on end. The other party's physical shell seemed to be reviving, but fortunately, these people were truly mediocre and flawed, ultimately lacking a bit of refinement.

He grabbed Su Zhenhe.

Su Zhenhe was terrified. He naturally knew he couldn't defeat Xu Yunfan, let alone the fact that he possessed no divine weapon or treasure armor. He was merely an outstanding true disciple of the current generation of the Xuanzhen Sect; the true pillar of the sect was someone else.

Even though the Xuanzhen Sect was large and influential, divine weapons weren't common goods; how could they give him one?

"Brother Xu!!"

Su Zhenhe cried out in alarm. Only when he realized Xu Yunfan wasn't throwing him onto the high platform did he let out a sigh of relief.

"What is this Blood Sacrifice Jade?"

Xu Yunfan's five fingers clamped down on Su Zhenhe's shoulder well acupoint like an iron hoop. The dragon scale armor scraped against the other's neck as he said coldly, "Two thousand years ago, the experts of the great sects fell here. I don't believe your Xuanzhen Sect truly knows nothing about the news inside."

His fingertips suddenly exerted force, pressing Su Zhenhe against a dragon-winding pillar carved with runes. Dark red bloodstains on the pillar surface were slowly flowing along the grooves.

Su Zhenhe's back was pressed against the icy jade pillar. He clearly felt the blood lines, like living things, climbing up his spine.

He stared at the dragon scale armor on Xu Yunfan, the scales flaring up like inverted scales, and his voice trembled unconsciously.

"The Xuanzhen Sect has clear records. Blood Sacrifice Jade is a treasure for ancient cultivators to defy heaven and prolong their lives. It is formed by pouring the essence blood of ten thousand creatures into jade marrow. A palm-sized piece of Blood Sacrifice Jade likely requires two hundred thousand people to create."

Xu Yunfan's heart shook. He glanced sideways at the high platform.

This high platform, forged entirely from Blood Sacrifice Jade, was in the shape of an octagonal altar, with sides about three zhang long and a height of nine chi.

If a palm-sized piece of Blood Sacrifice Jade required the blood of an entire city, then a Blood Sacrifice Jade of this scale...

The slaughter it caused was probably no less than that of the female demon of the Great Zhou.

Hearing this, Su Zhenhe's expression also revealed shock. Even though he was born into one of the Six Great Sects and was inherently separated from the lower-class common people.

But if killing ten million people was just for a piece of Blood Sacrifice Jade, to seek an indestructible body and eternal life, he had to admit he couldn't do it.

"The man on that high platform must be a demonic path expert!"

Listening to Su Zhenhe's gritted teeth, Xu Yunfan's heart moved slightly. He took out the token he had taken from the Qingyue True Person.

"What do the two characters on this token say?"

Su Zhenhe took a look, and his pupils contracted violently. But facing Xu Yunfan's rapidly chilling, murderous gaze, he had no choice but to answer.

"This is from two thousand years ago, the True Script. These two characters are called 'Primordial Origin' (Yuanshi)."

Xu Yunfan's heart moved slightly.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's eyes relax, Su Zhenhe's heart eased. Just as he was about to explain further, Xu Yunfan's fingers suddenly exerted a great force.

Crack!

Facing Su Zhenhe's disbelieving gaze, Xu Yunfan lowered his eyelids slightly, his knuckles gently stroking the Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane.

The dim light of the White Jade Palace cast a shadow on his brow ridge, hiding the emotions in his eyes in obscurity.

"Brother Su should understand." His voice was very light, but it was like a blunt knife scraping over bluestone. "Only dead men tell no tales."

He had to clean up the information about his presence in this small world secret realm. Otherwise, once he walked out of the secret realm, if the information leaked even slightly, and all the true disciples of the great sects died inside while he alone survived, anyone would find it suspicious.

In these times, once the high and mighty top sects became suspicious, they would generally kill indiscriminately rather than let one go.

The dragon scale armor silently flared and contracted, releasing the still-unspent force.

The force in his fingertips burst out instantly, penetrating Su Zhenhe's body, shattering his internal organs, and turning his head into pulp. Only then did he casually place him to the side.

His gaze glanced at the fingers beneath Su Zhenhe's robe gripping the sword hilt, the knuckles white even in death, not letting go in the slightest.
