# Chapter 118: Amethyst-Winged Tiger

Mu Su remained expressionless, ignoring Ling Yu's gaze. Holding Zhou Tian's clothes, he spoke, "You'll find out what's wrong with him in a moment."

Ling Yu was bewildered, unsure what Mu Su meant. But before her confusion could deepen, her attention was drawn to a towering pillar of fire, as intense as molten lava, from which thick black smoke ascended. Ancient trees were burning, and even exotic ancient trees that had grown for countless years couldn't withstand the flames' power. Accompanying this was the tremor of the earth.

"Who provoked the Crimsonflame Giant Ape?" Ling Yu asked, somewhat perplexed, staring at the nearly sky-high pillar of crimson flame that bathed the vicinity in a fiery red, as if a bronze furnace were burning in the heavens.

The Spider Cult had been active in the Myriad Gods Mountains for years, thoroughly understanding this branch range. They knew exactly which ferocious beasts inhabited which locations. She naturally knew that there was only one Crimsonflame Giant Ape in that direction, a beast king not to be trifled with. She was very curious as to who possessed such audacity to provoke it.

Firelight reflected in Mu Su's eyes. He lifted the clothes in his hands slightly. Though he didn't speak, his meaning was self-evident.

"He wouldn't go and…" Ling Yu asked incredulously, "take off his clothes to provoke the Crimsonflame Giant Ape?"

Mu Su nodded, indicating that his elder brother was indeed such a bold and unyielding man.

Ling Yu stared at the crimson-blazed land in the distance, various thoughts flickering through her mind. No matter how she thought about it, she couldn't fathom why one would take off their clothes before provoking it. Did Zhou Tian have some special method of provocation?

"Aren't you afraid he'll be in danger?" Ling Yu asked Mu Su, who showed no hint of worry.

The Crimsonflame Giant Ape was no ordinary beast. Its ancestors were once companions to powerful deities, their strength formidable and renowned. Their bloodline had been passed down through generations without interruption, possessing astonishing divine abilities, making them one of the more famous ferocious beasts in the Myriad Gods Mountains.

"It would be better if he died," Mu Su said bluntly.

"..." Ling Yu choked. These two were truly sick in the head.

Mu Su watched the young girl's eyes darting around, wondering what she was thinking. After a moment, he spoke, "You'd best turn around. Zhou Tian might appear suddenly at any moment, and I imagine you wouldn't want to see him naked."

Ling Yu's expression shifted slightly. She certainly didn't want to see that eye-scorching sight a second time. She turned around and leaned against a thick ancient tree.

Mu Su breathed a sigh of relief. Finally, he didn't have to answer this woman's questions. Women were truly troublesome.

A moment later, Zhou Tian's figure appeared.

"You even remembered to warn her to hide beforehand, Mu Su. How thoughtful of you." He took the clothes from Mu Su's hand, landed, and put them on.

Mu Su was now too lazy to bother with Zhou Tian's teasing. After Zhou Tian was dressed, he beckoned Ling Yu to come out.

"Why did you take off your clothes to provoke the Crimsonflame Giant Ape?" Ling Yu asked, feigning nonchalance. Zhou Tian didn't seem like someone with a brain problem; why would he do such a thing? She felt there must be a secret.

"Do you know the most crucial prerequisite for becoming the King of Gods?" Zhou Tian pondered for a moment, then said to Ling Yu with a serious expression.

"What?" Ling Yu's curiosity was piqued.

"Not casually prying into others' secrets," Zhou Tian said mysteriously.

"What does that have to do with becoming the King of Gods?!" Ling Yu instantly bristled, purple light flickering in her eyes. The Spider Cult was known for its cunning, yet today, she had been played by Zhou Tian.

"Then does it matter to you whether I take my clothes off or not?" Zhou Tian said indifferently. "Ling Yu, your colored contacts are too cheap, not even as good as those few junior brothers from Daluo Academy. Your edgy vibe is just too strong."

Ling Yu felt a flame brewing in her chest. *You weren't saying that when you just asked about my secret earlier!*

"Then why did you just pry into my secret?"

"I didn't force you to tell me, did I?"

Ling Yu's chest heaved incessantly. Recalling her mother's instructions, she forcibly suppressed her anger and calmed down, walking aside to sulk alone.

Zhou Tian spread his hands, as if to say, *Blame me, then?*

They didn't linger there for too long; they still had to press on. According to the map gifted by the Spider Cult when they left, they still had some distance to cover after crossing the Myriad Gods Mountains before reaching Myriad Gods Peak.

These remnant divine cults were truly in decline. Even a top dark-side cult like the Spider Cult didn't possess any special travel artifacts, forcing them to rely on their feet.

Though they had an extra person, their travel speed was much faster. Originally, it was just the two of them, two grown men, free to stop and admire the scenery as they pleased. Now, with a woman along, they moved quicker.

Ling Yu couldn't be bothered with these two perverts, and Zhou Tian and Mu Su didn't want to converse with twenty thousand ducks. Zhou Tian had originally wanted to set up Ling Yu and Mu Su, because Mu Su had just gone through a major change and his heart was immensely empty, needing someone to fill it. Zhou Tian believed he had the ability and obligation to help him resolve this.

However, the education Mu Su received from childhood made him view Ling Yu with a biased eye. He constantly felt as if she had eight claws growing out of her back, ready to devour them at any moment, and he didn't want to say much.

As for Ling Yu, her extremely poor impression of Zhou Tian led to a less-than-favorable impression of Mu Su, causing Zhou Tian's intentions to fall flat.

***

A rustling sound echoed.

It was Zhou Tian's usual disrobing. After this period of familiarity, Ling Yu had reached the point where she would instinctively turn away the moment Zhou Tian's hand went to his pants.

This was Zhou Tian's fifth "death-seeking" trip since leaving the Spider Cult. He was heading towards the location of a nearby beast king. With the map obtained from the Spider Cult, things were much simpler.

"This looks like an Amethyst-Winged Tiger, hmm?"

Before Zhou Tian even reached its territory, he felt tremors from the ground. Verdant leaves rustled down, as if some colossal being was thrashing about.

"Roar!"

An earth-shattering roar erupted, sound waves rippling out, nearly snapping the nearby ancient trees. A massive figure suddenly leaped into the air, nearly a hundred feet tall, its entire body appearing forged from purple crystal, shimmering with divine light. A pair of wings sprouted from its ribs, making it appear incomparably majestic. Yet, at this moment, several chains bound it tightly from head to toe. They were utterly black, etched with profound runes, absorbing all ambient light, even drawing away the purple luminescence from the Amethyst-Winged Tiger itself.

Before Zhou Tian could ponder further, several more figures soared into the sky. Their entire bodies were cloaked in black robes, their features indiscernible. There were six of them, each pulling on a black chain, their bodies erupting with energy as a continuous flow of power was injected into the chains.

The Amethyst-Winged Tiger erupted with divine light, its roar almost shattering space. Profound runes appeared on its amethyst body, energy coursing through them, igniting the deepest power within it.
