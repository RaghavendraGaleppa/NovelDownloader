# Chapter 456: Mo Qingtang's Skill

The most exquisite part was the crimson gauze dress. It appeared modest but was actually as thin as a cicada's wing. With every breath, the alluring figure beneath her collarbone was faintly visible.

*Some skill,* Xu Yunfan thought. *Disciples from the Hundred Desires Peak, one and all, are this seductive.*

Xu Yunfan's expression remained indifferent as he coldly watched Mo Qingtang prostrate herself at his feet.

"Master Bai Hua returned from the Southern Frontier last night," she said, her fingers unconsciously tracing the fabric at her throat. The movement caused the neckline of her gauze dress to slip even lower. "She brought back an urgent item that must be presented to the Peak Master immediately. That is why this servant..."

She suddenly fell silent mid-explanation.

Xu Yunfan was casually playing with three Peach Blossom Pills. The pressure of a Core Formation expert's aura swept over her body, faint yet palpable.

These Peach Blossom Pills were a specialty of the Hundred Desires Peak. Once ingested, they would stimulate the body's Yang energy. If one practiced dual cultivation techniques, the results would be twice the effort for half the work.

Mo Qingtang's breathing immediately became ragged, and an unnatural flush crept across her cheeks. The techniques of the Hundred Desires Peak were inherently sensitive to the spiritual pressure of high-level cultivators.

Moreover, she was facing a Core Formation expert. Even though she was at the peak of Qi Condensation, without reaching Core Formation, there was an insurmountable gap between them.

"This servant knows her wrongs," she suddenly changed her tune, her voice carrying a damp, emotional undertone. "I am willing to use the third volume of the *Hundred Alluring Forms* to relieve the Master's boredom."

*Hundred Alluring Forms?*

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed. He had spent some time at the Hundred Desires Peak in the past. After achieving Core Formation, he had severed all ties with the peak. Even Master Bai Hua, who had originally named him to join the Hundred Desires Peak, had never shown her face again.

Naturally, Xu Yunfan knew of the *Hundred Alluring Forms*.

It was a technique that used one's own cultivation to please others, possessing supreme charm.

When he was cultivating at the Hundred Desires Peak back then, he had witnessed this secret art that used cultivation as bait. This technique focused on using one's own vital essence as a guide, circulating it through special meridians to transfer one's cultivation to another during intercourse.

For Qi Condensation cultivators, it was indeed a shortcut to solidify one's foundation.

If he were still in the Qi Condensation stage, such a pure, true inheritance technique from the Hundred Desires Peak would have truly tempted him.

After all, during the Qi Condensation stage, every instance of dual cultivation was crucial for the stability of one's Dao foundation.

But now that he had achieved Core Formation, the true energy within him formed its own cycle. Such opportunistic methods had become mere chicken ribs.

"It's a pity to waste such a set of techniques," he mused.

After Core Formation, the balance of Yin and Yang was already perfected. These external methods were merely for amusement.

However, a little amusement was necessary for the relaxation and tension required in cultivation.

As she spoke, Mo Qingtang actually undid the phoenix belt at her waist herself. The crimson gauze dress flowed down like water, pooling at her elbows.

As she activated her technique, intricate patterns appeared on her skin, seeming to come alive. Dewdrops seeped from between the petals, refracting a seven-colored halo in the morning light.

Xu Yunfan watched her performance with cold eyes.

Mo Qingtang had indeed obtained the true inheritance of the Hundred Desires Peak. Every movement of hers subtly conformed to the rhythm of the natural Dao, even the swaying of her hair was calculated to perfection.

***

Three days and nights passed without incident.

Xu Yunfan coldly watched Mo Qingtang crawl out of his cultivation cave dwelling, her body weak and powerless. He said indifferently, "From now on, the monthly taxes of Cold Crow Pass must not be short by a single point."

Mo Qingtang's heart trembled, and a sense of bitterness arose within her. It seemed her efforts of the past few days were in vain. His heart was as hard as iron and was not moved in the slightest.

If it weren't for her mastery of the Hundred Desires Peak's wonderful techniques, she might have been worked to death by Xu Yunfan over these few days.

Thinking of this, her body ached faintly all over.

"Yes, this servant understands!" she replied.

Although she harbored resentment in her heart, Mo Qingtang did not hesitate in the slightest, answering respectfully.

No matter which peak she belonged to, since Xu Yunfan was now the Town Guard of Cold Crow Pass and a Core Formation expert, if she showed even the slightest hint of resistance, it would be her own fault if he killed her.

***

Three days later.

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back on the observation deck of the Xuanming Pavilion's top floor. The moon was bright, and the stars were gathered.

High in the sky, a Milky Way stretched from east to west, like a waterfall of stars pouring down from the ninth heaven. Billions of stars floated and swayed within it.

The Big Dipper hung high in the north. The four stars of Dubhe, Merak, Phecda, and Megrez, forming the ladle's body, shone brilliantly. The three stars of Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid, forming the handle, pointed directly towards the position of True Martial Xuanming.

Xu Yunfan looked up, seeing that the stars of the True Martial Seven Mansions within the Purple Forbidden Enclosure were exceptionally bright.

The Dipper Mansion coiled like a turtle and snake, the Ox Mansion raised its head like a Black Tortoise, the Girl Mansion waved like a black banner. The Emptiness, Danger, Room, and Wall Mansions were arranged in sequence, outlining a complete Black Tortoise constellation on the celestial curtain.

Every star pulsed with visible starlight, weaving a brilliant net of stars in the night sky.

"The True Martial descends to the world, the Big Dipper dictates death..."

Xu Yunfan unconsciously recited the aphorism from the扉页 of the True Scripture.

At this moment, a wonderful resonance occurred between the celestial phenomena and his cultivation method. The thirty-six vital acupoints along his spinal column thumped simultaneously, each corresponding to a star in the sky.

If he could take this opportunity to activate the *Grotto-Heaven Grafting Technique*, using the Celestial Yang Qi as a guide and the Terrestrial Yin Qi as a foundation, he might be able to preliminarily condense a Grotto-Heaven prototype within his body, thereby connecting to the Divine Martial World.

The image of Mo Qingtang's staggering figure as she left three days ago was still fresh in his mind. The monthly tribute of 100,000 mid-grade spirit stones was now quietly lying at the bottom of his storage bag, but compared to the seventy percent deficit embezzled by Li Wei, it was still a drop in the bucket.

It would still take a considerable amount of time to fill the gap.

Fortunately, the Clear Source True Lord had not specified a deadline for the tribute. As long as it was replenished, there would naturally be plenty of time.

"The turtle and snake coil, the Big Dipper hangs high..." he murmured.

He suddenly formed a seal with his fingers, drawing upon the magical power within him. The phantom of a turtle and snake appeared at his Dantian, suddenly raising its head and hissing.

Twelve years had passed since the early Core Formation stage. Of the requirements in the *True Scripture of the True Martial Subduing Demons*—to use the Northern Polar Demon-Dispelling Qi and the Subduing Demon Terrestrial Qi to guide the thirty-six Celestial and Terrestrial Qi—he had only managed to refine about half.

Moreover, a considerable portion of the Celestial and Terrestrial Qi could not be obtained through guidance and cultivation; he had to personally go and seek them out.

To break through to the mid-stage, he would need to open a Grotto-Heaven prototype in his spinal column, using the *Grotto-Heaven Grafting Technique* as a guide to connect the root power of the Divine Martial World to himself.

This matter was neither difficult nor easy.

At the very least, he had to condense a prototype first.

With the Grotto-Heaven Grafting Technique, there was naturally a great deal of room for operation.

A wisp of gray-black Yin River Yin Qi suddenly condensed at his fingertip. Xu Yunfan stared intently at the aura twining around his knuckle.

The supreme Yin power accumulated in Cold Crow Pass over ten thousand years was unexpectedly in line with the essence of the True Scripture's "Black Tortoise Carrying the Heavens."

If he could use the Yin River as the foundation for the Terrestrial Qi, and then gather the Celestial Qi from the highest heavens...

"Hm?"

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted. His spiritual sense had suddenly detected a fluctuation of spiritual energy at the main gate of the pass.

The feedback from the mountain protection formation was clear. A Buddhist light had pierced through the Yin River Yin Qi, piercing into Cold Crow Pass's defense system like a scorching golden needle.

This was an early warning mechanism he had set up yesterday. With his foundation of having mastered the preliminary introduction to array formations, it was naturally effortless to extend a warning and detection array from this mountain protection formation.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. This spiritual energy, carrying the unique sandalwood scent of the Bodhi Pure Land, he had encountered it three years ago during the conflict between the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the Bodhi Pure Land, and the Primordial Origin Sect over the Void Mountain Blessed Land.

Most importantly, the aura leaking from the intruder.

It was comparable to a Core Formation expert!
