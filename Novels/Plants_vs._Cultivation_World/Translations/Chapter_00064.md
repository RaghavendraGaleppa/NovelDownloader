# Chapter 64: Bumper Harvest  

"Greetings, Senior Brothers!"  

Gu Mo bowed in salute. As an outer disciple, he couldn't neglect proper etiquette when facing inner disciples.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, no need for such formality."  

The inner disciples waved their hands dismissively. Gu Mo's status as an outer disciple was no longer inferior to theirs. Rumor had it that Deacon Zhao had promised to help him apply for promotion to inner disciple status as long as he could consistently supply Spirit Water Rice.  

In a few years, Gu Mo might very well become one of them.  

"Ahem!"  

After exchanging a few pleasantries, the inner disciples quickly got to the point. "Junior Brother Gu Mo, how was this year's Spirit Water Rice harvest?"  

The yield of Gu Mo's Spirit Water Rice directly determined whether they could purchase any from him. High-grade spiritual crops like this were notoriously unstable in production—even a slight mishap could lead to reduced yields, and in severe cases, total crop failure was possible.  

This was precisely why Zhao Qiancheng had stipulated that Gu Mo must stabilize the rice's output before he could apply for promotion. High-grade spiritual crops were difficult to cultivate consistently. If Gu Mo could truly achieve stable production, becoming an inner disciple would be a foregone conclusion.  

"I was just about to register the yield. Would you like to join me, Senior Brothers?" Gu Mo smiled. He was well aware that their enthusiasm stemmed solely from their desire for his Spirit Water Rice.  

"Excellent!"  

The inner disciples nodded eagerly. Soon, surrounded by the group, Gu Mo arrived at the warehouse.  

The overseer in charge of yield registration perked up at the sight of Gu Mo. This was his second time registering Spirit Water Rice production. The current yield would provide a clear indication of whether Gu Mo could maintain stable output.  

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Gu Mo began unloading the harvested rice ears. In moments, a small mountain of Spirit Water Rice had piled up.  

The sight left the gathered inner and outer disciples dumbfounded. Spirit Water Rice was typically cultivated only by a handful of veteran spiritual farmers in the Spiritual Planting Hall. Moreover, their yields were usually claimed by inner disciples before even reaching the warehouse.  

Only a tiny portion remained for other sect members to exchange with contribution points. Given the sheer number of outer and inner disciples in the Qinglu Sect, competition for the rice was fierce. Few were lucky enough to obtain even a pound or two, while most had never even seen Spirit Water Rice in person.  

Now, faced with this staggering pile of rice, the impact was overwhelming.  

---  

Though the exact yield hadn't been measured yet, everyone knew Gu Mo had achieved a bumper harvest. Amidst the stunned silence, the overseer swiftly placed the rice ears into a specialized artifact. Moments later, crystal-clear grains of Spirit Water Rice emerged.  

"330 pounds!"  

The final figure left the overseer wide-eyed. Gu Mo had not only matched his previous yield of 300 pounds but had increased it by another 10%.  

According to the agreement, 200 pounds would be handed over to the sect, earning Gu Mo 2,000 contribution points. The remaining 130 pounds belonged to him.  

As soon as the registration was complete, countless fervent gazes locked onto Gu Mo. 130 pounds of Spirit Water Rice—what an immense fortune!  

"Senior Brother Mai!"  

Gu Mo scanned the crowd and spotted a familiar face, calling out to him.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo!"  

Mai Yunfa approached with a grin. Upon hearing that Gu Mo had come to register his yield, he had rushed over—only to witness this astonishing scene.  

330 pounds per acre of Spirit Water Rice. If there were a yield competition like the one for Spirit Jade Rice, Gu Mo would undoubtedly be this year's undisputed champion.  

The Spiritual Planting Hall's few acres of Spirit Water Rice had been harvested days earlier, and the yields had already been recorded. However, those crops had been directly claimed by inner disciples without ever reaching the warehouse. Still, the yield figures would eventually be logged in the hall's records.  

Among those plots, the highest yield was 290 pounds per acre, while the lowest was only 180—a staggering 110-pound difference. This stark contrast highlighted just how difficult it was to stabilize high-grade spiritual crop yields.  

And this was during a relatively stable year. In less favorable conditions, the yields would have been even lower.  

Against this backdrop, Gu Mo's 330-pound yield was nothing short of miraculous—especially since he had already achieved 300 pounds in his previous harvest.  

"Senior Brother Mai, I'd like to ask for your help with something." Gu Mo pulled Mai Yunfa aside and whispered a few words.  

Shortly after, Mai Yunfa returned to the crowd with a beaming smile. "Everyone, Junior Brother Gu Mo has entrusted me with auctioning his Spirit Water Rice. Those interested in bidding, please gather here."  

As the crowd surged toward Mai Yunfa, Gu Mo seized the opportunity to slip away.  

He knew he wouldn't be able to leave without parting with some rice, but aside from Mai Yunfa, he barely knew any of the inner disciples.  

An auction was the simplest solution—highest bidder wins. As for entrusting Mai Yunfa with the task, Gu Mo simply wanted to avoid the hassle. Senior Brother Mai had extensive connections in the Spiritual Planting Hall, making him the perfect choice to handle the auction.  

---  

After leaving the Spiritual Planting Hall, Gu Mo took out his paper crane talisman, only to find its spiritual glow dimmed—it was no longer usable.  

Without hesitation, he summoned his mid-grade flying sword. At this point, no one would question Gu Mo's right to own such a weapon. After all, someone capable of cultivating Spirit Water Rice could certainly afford a flying sword.  

Infusing the sword with spiritual energy, he watched it expand before leaping onto it. With a flick of his fingers, the sword shot toward the sect's marketplace like a streak of light.  

"Brother Gu Mo!"  

Upon spotting Gu Mo, Gou Youyu greeted him warmly—though his enthusiasm now carried a different undertone. The reason was simple: after sensing something unusual about Gu Mo during their last meeting, Gou Youyu had used his rice procurement connections to investigate.  

Within the Qinglu Sect, only the Spiritual Planting Hall had the authority to sell spiritual rice. Gu Mo had become a prominent figure there, and Gou Youyu had easily uncovered details about him.  

Upon learning that Gu Mo had successfully cultivated Spirit Water Rice, Gou Youyu realized there was no "powerful backer" behind him—Gu Mo himself was the powerhouse, a master capable of growing such a rare crop.  

Armed with this knowledge, Gou Youyu's attitude had naturally shifted. But since Gu Mo hadn't brought it up, he played along, pretending ignorance.  

Gu Mo noticed the change in Gou Youyu's demeanor but paid it no mind. In fact, he had intended for this outcome—after all, he still had questions about the Wine God's Spirit Tempering Technique to discuss, and maintaining secrecy would only complicate matters.
