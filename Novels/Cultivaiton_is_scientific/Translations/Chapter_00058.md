# Chapter 58: The Crime Scene

In the northeastern corner of Zhongdu City, most residents were merchants. 

In the Great Xia dynasty, merchants held relatively low social status. No matter how extravagantly they built their homes, they dared not overstep regulations regarding gate designs or interior layouts.

On a moonless night with howling winds, within one such courtyard, a third-level Qi Refining cultivator was writing something. 

Behind him, a shadowy figure appeared. 

At such close proximity, the third-level cultivator remained completely unaware as the shadow extended its arms and embraced him.

The next morning, Gu Jia arrived at the crime scene.

It had been his decision to allow rogue cultivators into Zhongdu City. These cultivators had generally kept their promise not to cause trouble within city limits.

The rogue cultivators were concentrated in this northeastern district, where merchants had been persuaded by the imperial family to host them.

This arrangement had worked without issue—until August arrived.

People began dying in succession. At first, it was only mortals, but now a rogue cultivator had become a victim.

Accompanying Gu Jia was Clan Leader Liu, while the area was cordoned off by the Dali Temple officials.

"The yin energy here is overwhelming!" Gu Jia frowned as soon as he reached the crime scene's entrance.

"Fellow Daoist Gu, was this done by a demonic cultivator?" Clan Leader Liu asked with a grim expression.

"It's a corpse puppet," Gu Jia replied after entering and examining the fallen cultivator. "I can't confirm if it's a demonic cultivator's work, but the method is extremely sinister—definitely not from any righteous path."

Most sects possessed corpse refinement techniques, so the practice itself wasn't inherently evil. 

However, corpse puppets that drained cultivators' vital essence crossed the tolerance threshold of most orthodox sects.

The rogue cultivator on the ground had been completely drained of blood, leaving only an empty husk—a grotesque sight.

"Fellow Daoist Gu, this is a direct challenge to the Tianhai Sect. We beg for your justice!" Clan Leader Liu bowed deeply.

Gu Jia nodded. Regardless of circumstances, this incident had occurred within Zhongdu City.

While the entire Great Xia fell under Tianhai Sect's domain, the sect generally ignored cultivators as long as they didn't cause trouble in cities.

But this was different—not only did it happen in the city, but in the capital where Tianhai Sect cultivators were stationed. First mortals, now cultivators were being killed.

"Wait while I track down this culprit," Gu Jia said solemnly.

He retrieved an Intermediate Tracking Talisman from his storage bag. Channeling spiritual power, the talisman transformed into a beam of light that locked onto the residual yin energy as he willed it.

The Intermediate Tracking Talisman could last for three hours, during which the user could sense all paths taken by the target.

"Follow me," Gu Jia said to Clan Leader Liu.

After a brief hesitation, Clan Leader Liu followed him out.

Without using the Lightbody Technique, Gu Jia simply tapped lightly against a wall with his seventh-level Qi Refining physique to vault over the high courtyard wall.

Clan Leader Liu lacked such ability and had to activate a Basic Lightbody Talisman before following suit.

Gu Jia moved swiftly, his speed only restrained by the need to track the talisman's sensed energy.

Near the city walls, he stopped.

"What's wrong, Fellow Daoist Gu?" Clan Leader Liu asked urgently upon seeing him halt.

"Trouble," Gu Jia shook his head. "The cultivator controlled the corpse puppet to commit the murder, then recalled it here. The tracking talisman lost its target."

Internally, Gu Jia considered deeper implications. Compared to these rogue cultivators, he understood corpse puppets much better.

A corpse puppet capable of independent action—and killing a third-level Qi Refining cultivator without detection—must have reached at least the Bronze Corpse stage.

Bronze Corpses represented fully matured corpse puppets with strength equivalent to Qi Refining cultivators. 

They were categorized into early, middle, and late stages, but any Bronze Corpse possessed formidable defenses that could withstand spiritual attacks to some degree.

Moreover, their tremendous strength made them dangerous opponents even for cultivators of the same level, with attacks carrying corpse poison that could paralyze Qi Refining cultivators and cause extensive necrosis if untreated.

Judging by how easily this one killed a third-level cultivator, Gu Jia estimated it to be at least mid-stage Bronze Corpse, possibly stronger.

Combined with the timing during the Ascension Assembly, Gu Jia had further suspicions.

"Fellow Daoist Liu, I must report this to the sect. Meanwhile, mobilize the rogue cultivators—anyone who can track down this perpetrator can apply for a 500-spirit-stone reward from the sect," Gu Jia said after consideration.

Clan Leader Liu's eyes initially lit up at the offer, but realization quickly dawned.

"I'll spread the word," he agreed, understanding that such a substantial reward indicated the matter's severity.

"I hope I'm overthinking this," Gu Jia thought grimly to himself.

Meanwhile, Li Shiming had received an official position—a seventh-rank sinecure without actual duties.

Typically, the Tanhua (third-place scholar) would enter the Hanlin Academy as a seventh-rank compiler, part of the nation's most prestigious talent development path.

Yet no one interpreted the emperor's decision as suppression, given that Li Shiming had received several times more rewards than the Zhuangyuan (top scholar), including a grand residence.

An "Advanced Scholar" plaque from the palace was also delivered to the new residence, demonstrating exceptional imperial favor.

However, Li Shiming didn't move in, merely sending Mo Yan to accept it on his behalf.

With only a few servants currently, the new residence—over ten times larger than his current home—was unnecessary since he would soon depart.

At mealtime, Li Shiming held a bowl of spirit rice with a single dish before him—stir-fried spirit bamboo shoots from his Talisman Spirit Bamboo.

Over the past six months, the bamboo had thrived, growing a main stalk over three meters tall that nearly reached the server room space's ceiling.

With limited space preventing further growth, new bamboo shoots became part of his spiritual diet—solving the monotony of only having spirit rice.

Spirit bamboo shoots contained far more spiritual energy than spirit rice. At their current growth rate, he harvested one shoot monthly.

Each shoot provided five days' worth of meals, though they were somewhat excessive for his second-level Qi Refining cultivation.

Most cultivators wouldn't consume spirit bamboo shoots as food, as mature bamboo had greater value.

Li Shiming discovered that by preventing secondary stalk growth while maintaining ample spiritual energy and nutrient solution, the bamboo continuously produced shoots.

With nowhere else to plant them currently, spirit bamboo shoots became a regular dish on his table.
