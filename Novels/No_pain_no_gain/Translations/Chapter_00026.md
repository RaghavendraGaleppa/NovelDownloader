# Chapter 26: Han Yunzhi

The burly giant had a small satchel slung over his shoulder, his hands moving ceaselessly, a faint flicker of lightning visible on the talisman paper.

He did not lower his guard because of Han Zhen's words, and still said with an unfriendly expression, "My little sister is timid and shy. Unless you have important business, please do not bother her!"

"My name is Han Zhen. I only recently learned of the existence of the cultivation world, and many rules are still unclear to me. I hope you will be understanding." Han Zhen showed an embarrassed expression, looking like someone inexperienced in the ways of the world.

"I actually came specifically to visit after hearing rumors from the mountain villagers that cultivators appear in Tai'nan Valley. I just didn't know how to get through this white mist, which is why I resorted to this less-than-ideal method."

Han Zhen's words were sincere, and coupled with his deliberately honest and simple country hunter attire, his previous clumsy actions now seemed quite reasonable.

"Brother, I don't think he's a bad person." A clear female voice suddenly entered Han Zhen's ears.

The young girl, holding the burly giant's other arm, peeked half her head out from his side, looking at Han Zhen with curiosity.

"Little sister, you're just too naive. That's why I don't trust you to act alone. You know, you can know a person's face, but not their heart," the burly giant said meaningfully.

Although it was a bit unpleasant to be told this to his face, Han Zhen was, after all, asking for help, and he was indeed feigning youthful innocence, so he couldn't very well retort.

So Han Zhen just gave an awkward smile: "Indeed, I was rash."

"Big Brother!" the young girl exclaimed, somewhat displeased.

Seeing Han Zhen's good-natured expression and continuous apologies, and considering his young age yet considerable cultivation, the burly man decided it wouldn't be good to make an enemy.

"Fellow Daoist Han, please be more careful next time. It's a good thing you met my sister and me. If you had encountered some unreasonable family disciples, you might have been mistaken for a rogue cultivator and killed."

The burly man put away the lightning talisman in his hand, but still maintained a certain distance.

"Thank you for the guidance, Fellow Daoist. May I ask how I can enter the valley?" Seeing the other party's attitude soften, Han Zhen quickly asked.

In truth, Han Zhen had already learned the incantation for voice transmission talismans, but had no means to acquire the actual talismans, so he decided to seize the opportunity to get a free ride from the siblings before him.

"That's why I said he's not a bad person, he doesn't even know the most basic knowledge of the cultivation world."

The young girl seemed to have finally met a cultivation newbie and couldn't resist showing off a bit. She pulled out a talisman paper from her sachet, gestured with it a few times in her hand, and then muttered something under her breath.

Afterwards, she tossed the talisman paper into the air, where it transformed into a white light that shot into the mist and vanished.

"In places like this, covered by a formation, if Brother Han... if you want to enter, you must use a voice transmission talisman like this to announce your intentions."

"Only after someone inside the formation receives the transmission and opens the formation to receive you can you enter safely."

Seeing Han Zhen's curious expression regarding the voice transmission talisman, the young girl explained, leaning half her body out despite her brother's attempt to stop her.

"Oh." Han Zhen nodded, indicating he had learned something.

He then quietly waited by the side, with no intention of conversing further with the young girl.

Seeing that Han Zhen did not take the opportunity to flatter or get close to his little sister, the burly giant couldn't help but develop a favorable impression of him.

So his tone of voice was no longer aggressive: "Fellow Daoist Han, please wait a moment. Once this voice transmission talisman notifies those within the valley, the formation will open shortly."

A moment later, the dense mist before them suddenly churned, as if sliced open by a sword, parting to reveal a small path wide enough for two people to walk side-by-side.

The other end of the path was out of sight, seemingly very far away.

"You can go in now," the burly man reminded.

Han Zhen naturally understood his meaning and took the lead, walking in front.

The first thing he noticed was that the spiritual energy inside was considerably more abundant than outside.

After entering the formation, the young girl knew there was no danger, and ignoring her brother's attempts to stop her, suddenly asked from behind, "Brother Han, are you planning to exchange or purchase anything during your visit to Tai'nan Valley?"

"Uh... my current cultivation technique has reached its limit. I accidentally learned that other cultivators reside here, so I wanted to come and get to know them, and see if there's a way to acquire follow-up techniques," Han Zhen replied helplessly.

He indeed had valuable items on him, but he dared not easily show them to others.

A Qi Condensation stage cultivator possessing an Immortal Ascension Token and a talisman treasure would invite mortal danger if word got out.

Han Zhen only hoped that the 6 pieces of spirit-filled jade he got from Yu Zhitong were indeed spiritual stones.

Adding a Vajra Talisman with less than half its spiritual potency and a brand new one, they could be worth about 12 spiritual stones combined. If necessary, they could also be sold or exchanged.

Calculating this, his total usable assets amounted to only 18 spiritual stones. To get what he needed, this amount was far from enough.

Han Zhen remembered that a comprehensive basic spell manual sold in the shops of Tai'nan Valley cost over a hundred spiritual stones, and even a basic spell manual for a single attribute cost several tens of spiritual stones.

Without spiritual stones, it was truly difficult to move an inch in the cultivation world.

"That's a shame. The Tai'nan Minor Gathering is still two years away. It won't be easy to buy cultivation techniques cheaply now."

The young girl then explained to Han Zhen that the Tai'nan Minor Gathering was a trading event specifically organized for the younger generation of Lan Province, held only once every five years.

On ordinary days, there were at most a few hundred rogue cultivators in Tai'nan Valley, making it difficult to find anything good.

Han Zhen had long known all of this, but he could only pretend to be hearing it for the first time, listening to the young girl's continuous chatter and occasionally responding.

A moment later, they finally reached the end of the path.

As Han Zhen stepped out of the path's exit, his eyes suddenly lit up. A verdant valley filled with exotic flowers and rare plants appeared before him.

The entire area was vast, covering well over a hundred *mu* of land.

Furthermore, Han Zhen could clearly feel that the spiritual energy within the valley was even stronger than on the small path after the formation opened, indicating there was clearly a reason for Tai'nan Valley being established in this location.

In the center, there was a large cluster of palace-style pavilions with carved railings and jade-like finishes. Two or three cultivators could be seen on the pavilions.

In the open space in front of the pavilions, there was a very wide green-bricked square, where a few people had set up stalls and others were leisurely strolling about.

Witnessing this scene, Han Zhen felt a surge of emotion. From this moment on, he truly felt he had stepped into the cultivation world.

However, Han Zhen was well aware that without strength or background, only by being low-key and cautious could one see further.

Han Zhen turned back, cupped his fists, and said to the burly man, "May I know your esteemed name? If there's an opportunity in the future, I will surely repay this kindness."

"My name is Han Yunfeng, and I am also a rogue cultivator. There's no need to repay such a minor matter."

Hearing the burly man state his name, a name instantly flashed through Han Zhen's mind—Han Yunzhi.

Combining this with the burly giant and the young girl, it was highly likely that he wasn't mistaken.

"We'll take our leave now, Fellow Daoist Han." Han Yunfeng hadn't walked two steps when the young girl tugged at the shoulder strap of his satchel.

Only then did Han Yunfeng remember that he hadn't told Han Zhen the rules of Tai'nan Valley:

"I almost forgot to tell Fellow Daoist Han that during the period when the Tai'nan Minor Gathering is not being held, rogue cultivators are only permitted to stay in the valley for a maximum of seven days."

"If you wish to cultivate in the valley permanently, you would need to rent a pavilion. The spiritual energy there is even better than in the rest of the valley."

"The price isn't expensive either. In a normal year, renting for a year only costs three spiritual stones. Fellow Daoist Han might consider it."
