# Chapter 16: Shocking Rankings and Bountiful Rewards (Combined)

The soft rustling of Zhang Jing's footsteps abruptly ceased, his breathing becoming nearly imperceptible. The vast, boundless inheritance treasury once again fell into deathly silence, save for a single white jade pillar that began to glow with radiant light.

A line of small characters silently appeared on the illusory jade talisman:

[Five Viscera Water Origin Method - Uninitiated (0/70)]

As Zhang Jing carefully digested the information about the newly acquired cultivation technique, a peculiar light flashed in his eyes.

"It truly is a water-attribute cultivation method. The 'Five Viscera' refer to the five organs, which correspond to the five elements. Spiritual power transforms into a flowing river, cycling through the five elements—beginning with kidney water, ending at lung metal, then returning to kidney water—before being refined into pure spiritual energy stored in the dantian."

"Thus, the five organs nourish each other endlessly, with spiritual power flowing ceaselessly. As cultivation deepens, the organs grow stronger, spiritual power circulates like rivers, and the dantian becomes vast as an ocean."

"This is a mid-grade cultivation method? Truly formidable!"

A look of awe appeared in Zhang Jing's eyes. He could vividly imagine how terrifying the spiritual power of a cultivator who had mastered the [Five Viscera Water Origin Method] to profound levels would be—once mobilized, it would surge forth like an unending torrent.

What kind of despair would one feel being crushed by such pure, overwhelming spiritual power?

Zhang Jing didn't know, nor did he need to know. Because he was now on the same side! This problem could be left for future enemies to worry about. Or rather, Zhang Jing was always amicable—how could he possibly have enemies?

Lowering his gaze, he saw the jade key had lost its luster. The white jade pillar recording the [Five Viscera Water Origin Method] dimmed, returning to its original state.

It was about time. Senior Brother Liu and the others must be getting impatient.

Zhang Jing shook his head with a smile, suppressing his excitement as he calmly walked toward the bronze gate not far away.

Yet before he had gone far, his steps halted again. He slowly retreated until he stood before the third row of jade pillars on the right.

Taking a deep breath, he turned and walked straight inward.

Yes—this was exactly the feeling!

As the distance closed, Zhang Jing could clearly sense the previously dormant Black Python Devours Void Dao Rhyme becoming active, as if resonating with something.

Finally, where the Dao Rhyme fluctuations were strongest, Zhang Jing stopped and looked up.

High-grade inheritance—[Ocean-Overturning Python Seizes Void True Method]!

"The [Ocean-Overturning Python Seizes Void True Method] and the Black Python Devours Void Dao Rhyme must be connected. Or perhaps the Black Python Dao Rhyme is cultivated through this high-grade method?"

Zhang Jing pondered.

If so, it made sense that the incomplete Black Python Dao Rhyme within him would resonate with its corresponding inheritance.

Knowing this was one thing, but Zhang Jing currently had no means to obtain it. He certainly desired the high-grade cultivation method—having just witnessed the power of the mid-grade [Five Viscera Water Origin Method], the allure of an even higher-grade technique was undeniable.

Wait—where was he?

Snapping back to reality, Zhang Jing realized he had unconsciously approached the jade pillar recording the [Ocean-Overturning Python Seizes Void True Method], now standing less than a foot away.

The "once-in-ten-thousand perfect compatibility" Senior Brother Liu had mentioned, along with the high-grade inheritance...

Thump! Thump! Thump!

Zhang Jing's heart raced to his throat.

"I must find a way to obtain this high-grade inheritance—no matter what!" he inwardly vowed.

As time passed, his thoughts gradually settled. With one last reluctant glance at the [Ocean-Overturning Python Seizes Void True Method], Zhang Jing decisively turned away.

Without the corresponding jade key to unlock the inheritance, what could he do even if he stayed here a hundred years? Seeing but being unable to obtain it was worse than not seeing at all—sparing himself the frustration!

Outside the bronze gate:

"Senior Brother," Zhang Jing approached Senior Brother Liu, "I've made my choice."

"Judging by your expression, Junior Brother Zhang, you've found the most suitable inheritance," Senior Brother Liu said with a warm, knowing smile.

"I won't hide it from you, Senior Brother. I tested all the mid-grade cultivation methods and ultimately chose the most suitable [Five Viscera Water Origin Method]," Zhang Jing replied.

"[Five Viscera Water Origin Method]?" Senior Brother Liu stroked his chin approvingly. "That's an excellent choice—one of the most balanced water-attribute cultivation methods."

Recalling the method's characteristics, Senior Brother Liu's gaze turned slightly peculiar as he looked at Zhang Jing.

"Senior Brother, I was wondering..." Zhang Jing hesitated, thinking of the [Ocean-Overturning Python Seizes Void True Method]. He wanted to ask how to exchange for it and how many Dao Merits it required, but wasn't sure how to broach the subject—after all, he was just a newly admitted disciple.

"Speak freely, Junior Brother."

"Well... I wanted to ask how many Dao Merits a normal disciple would need to exchange for a mid-grade cultivation method like the one I chose," Zhang Jing probed indirectly.

"Normally exchange for a mid-grade method?" Senior Brother Liu's expression turned odd. "Junior Brother, you're not thinking of copying the [Five Viscera Water Origin Method] to trade for Dao Merits, are you? That's strictly forbidden! Besides, all methods in the Inheritance Pavilion have restrictions—you couldn't divulge them even if you tried."

"Senior Brother, you misunderstand! I'm just curious," Zhang Jing hastily explained.

"I see," Senior Brother Liu chuckled helplessly. "Well, there's no harm in telling you. Mid-grade inheritances in the Inheritance Hall require varying Dao Merits depending on type, with cultivation methods being the most expensive at 1,500 Dao Merits."

"1,500 Dao Merits?" Zhang Jing's eyes flashed with bewilderment.

Seeing this, Senior Brother Liu elaborated: "For example, ordinary disciples who received a 'Ding'-grade evaluation in the exam would need about seventy years to save up 1,500 Dao Merits after accounting for normal cultivation expenses. Generally, they have no hope—or need—to exchange for mid-grade inheritances."

"If mid-grade is like this, then high-grade must be..." Zhang Jing was stunned.

"Indeed," Senior Brother Liu nodded. "Usually only inner court disciples have enough Dao Merits for high-grade inheritances. Of course, there are exceptions—like the two 'Jia'-grade prodigies from your exam who can directly choose high-grade inheritances."

"But it's not absolute," Senior Brother Liu added consolingly. "Earning Dao Merits is incredibly difficult for most disciples, but remarkably easy for some. If you have your eye on a high-grade inheritance, Junior Brother, just focus on cultivation. The higher your realm, the easier Dao Merits become to obtain."

Zhang Jing's expression turned slightly embarrassed. "Senior Brother, you saw through me?"

"Haha, I've seen all kinds of disciples come through the Inheritance Pavilion. You're neither the first nor the last. Young people are full of ambition—I understand."

Zhang Jing didn't inquire further about the exact Dao Merit cost for high-grade inheritances. It was meaningless—whether it was the staggering figure of 1,500 or Senior Brother Liu's example, the message was clear: he currently had no hope.

Returning to the present, Zhang Jing said gratefully, "Thank you for explaining, Senior Brother." Then he changed the subject: "By the way, where is Deng An who came with me?"

"Junior Brother Deng? I had him go find lodging first."

Outside the Inheritance Pavilion:

"Junior Brother Zhang, see those buildings over there?" Senior Brother Liu pointed to a large cluster of structures nestled among trees.

"Yes, Senior Brother."

"That's where the Artificer Hall has assigned housing for new disciples. Barring exceptions, you'll likely live there for quite some time. I have matters to attend to, so I won't accompany you further. You may choose any unoccupied residence."

"Understood. Thank you, Senior Brother!" Zhang Jing said gratefully, shouldering his luggage.

Senior Brother Liu laughed heartily. "Just doing my duty—no need for thanks."

Following the stone path forward, Zhang Jing approached the wooded area. As he drew nearer, the trees grew denser, and the air carried the refreshing scent of spirit grass, instilling calm.

The forest was vast. Peering ahead, Zhang Jing saw simple courtyards scattered among the trees.

Tap, tap—

Footsteps grew from faint to clear as two men and two women approached, chatting amiably. They seemed quite familiar with each other.

Noticing Zhang Jing with his luggage, they appeared unsurprised. As they passed, one gentle-looking woman nodded slightly in greeting, which Zhang Jing returned with a smile.

"Four people—likely fellow 'Yi'-grade talents from the exam. Their lack of surprise suggests they've seen many new arrivals like me choosing residences," Zhang Jing mused.

This made sense—with geniuses from all thirteen provinces and fifty-seven counties of Nanli Kingdom converging here, of course there would be many.

Shaking his head to clear distracting thoughts, Zhang Jing reminded himself that others' talents didn't concern him. His sole focus now was cultivation—striving to attract spiritual energy into his body and achieve the Qi Refining realm as soon as possible, while seizing every opportunity to earn Dao Merits!

"Zhang... Brother Zhang?"

A highly uncertain voice interrupted his thoughts.

Turning toward the sound, Zhang Jing's eyes crinkled with amusement. "Brother Ji—I knew it was you just by the voice."

Opposite him, Ji Bochang muttered in disbelief, "This can't be... Did chatting with that senior sister last night exhaust me to the point of hallucinations? I must master the [Fish-Dragon Harmony Record] soon, or my body won't hold up..."

Seeing the "hallucination" persist, Ji Bochang snapped his folding fan shut, stuffed it into his sleeve, and vigorously rubbed his eyes. Upon reopening them—it was still there!

Not a hallucination...

Utterly dumbfounded, Ji Bochang instinctively stepped back, stammering, "Brother Zhang... are you human?"

"What nonsense," Zhang Jing retorted, rolling his eyes.

"So you've already mastered the visualization method? How is this possible?!" Ji Bochang's small but sharp eyes widened like saucers. This defied everything he knew about Zhang Jing—it felt like a dream.

"Haha, didn't you start a day earlier than me? As I said, mastering the visualization method was pure luck."

After a prolonged silence:

"That's bullshit!" Ji Bochang spat out, staring at Zhang Jing with complex emotions.

Those who earned "Yi"-grade evaluations did so primarily through talent, but supplementary cultivation resources had also played crucial roles—spirit-rich courtyards, spirit beast meat, elixirs...

Without these, Ji Bochang wasn't confident he could have achieved his evaluation. Yet Zhang Jing had done it purely through innate talent under far worse conditions.

"Brother Zhang, congratulations on passing the exam with a 'Yi'-grade evaluation! Your future is bright! Come, you must be looking for lodging—the courtyard next to mine is excellent."

Under Ji Bochang's insistent tugging, Zhang Jing had no choice but to follow.

"By the way, Brother Ji, weren't you heading out earlier?"

"Ah yes," Ji Bochang explained while leading the way. "Remember when I mentioned forgetting to bring spirit stones? My clan happened to send someone to Dragon Marsh Market today for supplies, so they're bringing my stones along."

He gestured to a gray beastskin pouch at his waist.

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened—he'd seen a similar pouch recently. Instructor Wang had taken a jade slip from an identical black beastskin pouch during his first lecture at the Seventh Provisional Academy.

"Is that a storage pouch?" Zhang Jing asked in surprise.

"Ah! I meant to keep it low-key, but nothing escapes your sharp eyes, Brother Zhang!" Ji Bochang said with exaggerated resignation, spreading his hands.

Zhang Jing's expression darkened, prompting him to change the subject: "Brother Ji, I encountered four people on my way here—"

"Two men and two women?" Ji Bochang interjected.

"You know them?" Zhang Jing asked curiously.

Instead of answering, Ji Bochang asked gravely, "Brother Zhang, do you know how many 'Yi'-grade talents have arrived as of today?"

Zhang Jing shook his head.

"Including you, Deng An, and someone from the Ninth Provisional Academy today—seventeen. And that doesn't count the two 'Jia'-grade monsters. Who knows how many more will come tomorrow."

Ji Bochang's tone grew dramatic. Seeing Zhang Jing's lack of reaction, he cleared his throat and continued seriously:

"Brother Zhang, you may not know this, but the Dao Academy establishes a final ranking for each exam. A senior sister I met yesterday told me that the top ten receive fifty Dao Merits monthly during their first year; eleventh to twentieth get twenty; twenty-first to thirtieth receive five; and those beyond thirty get nothing."

"What? Fifty Dao Merits monthly for the top ten?!" Zhang Jing exclaimed.
