# Chapter 159: Qu Junhou

**Deck 1773, Dingchou District**

"Should be this room, right?"

Zhang Jing gazed at the large door covered in immortal light before him and finally let out a quiet sigh of relief. 

After what felt like an eternity, he'd finally found it!

Due to the spatial expansion techniques employed, the interior of this Void Treasure Ship's deck tower was several times larger than its exterior appearance suggested. The structure boasted a staggering 2,732 decks, each divided into 29 districts containing anywhere from dozens to over a hundred rooms. The labyrinthine layout had made Zhang Jing's journey from the ship's bow deck to this location quite the ordeal.

He retrieved his boarding pass and pressed it lightly against the door. Instantly, the dense immortal light covering the entrance began to dissipate.

Just as he was about to enter—

*Rustle—*

The sound of approaching footsteps suddenly reached his ears. Turning toward the noise, Zhang Jing saw a young cultivator clad in golden robes approaching, his face bearing an unmistakable air of arrogance. The flashy pink jade pendant at his waist particularly stood out.

Before Zhang Jing could fully process this sight, his expression suddenly sharpened. The golden-robed figure was walking directly toward him with increasing speed, his aura swelling like a terrifying magnetic storm capable of annihilating all in its path.

"Not bad strength," Zhang Jing mused internally. "And this aggressive approach... trouble? But have we met before? Could he be from the Heavenly Court faction?"

After thirty-plus years in the Supreme Unity Infinite Dao Sect, Zhang Jing was certain he'd spent all his time in secluded cultivation on the immortal isles without making any enemies. His gaze gradually calmed—this person's strength was decent, but only just decent.

To his surprise, when the golden-robed man stopped before him, his overwhelming aura vanished completely.

"Ahem, fellow... brother," the man began cautiously, "might I ask directions to Dingchou District on Deck 1773? I've been searching forever but can't seem to find it. Whoever designed this Void Treasure Ship must have been missing some virtues—it's impossibly confusing."

Zhang Jing's face twitched with bemusement. After a moment's thought, he asked, "You've really been searching that long?"

The golden-robed man nodded earnestly.

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Jing pointed downward and said flatly, "This is Dingchou District."

"Th-this is it?" The man's eyes widened in disbelief as realization dawned. His face flushed slightly at having asked for directions to the very place he was standing in.

By the time he recovered enough to thank Zhang Jing, the latter had already entered his room.

Within the golden-robed man's consciousness, an argument erupted:

"Master, I told you not to give random directions! Now I've made a complete fool of myself!"

The fragmented spirit in his sea of consciousness bristled. "You dare blame me? Without my guidance, you wouldn't have even found Deck 1773!"

"But leading me to search for Dingchou District within Dingchou District itself is beyond ridiculous!"

"I was... familiarizing myself with the surroundings!"

"You were looking for Dingchou District in Dingchou District!"

"There were extenuating circumstances—"

"Dingchou District! Inside Dingchou District!" the man repeated mechanically.

The fragmented spirit finally snapped, "Enough! That young man you just spoke to—he's terrifyingly strong!"

"Of course he is—I just performed as his court jester," the man sighed.

"I mean his cultivation! He's at least your equal, if not stronger, and likely younger too."

The golden-robed man froze. "You're certain?"

The spirit nodded solemnly.

"Old man, you lied to me!" the man wailed. "You said I was the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator! We haven't even reached the Proud Cloud Secret Realm yet, and I've already encountered someone matching me! At this rate, there'll be thousands!"

"First," the spirit said, rolling its eyes, "you're one of the strongest. Second, thousands? Impossible. That youth is a true prodigy, likely personally trained by one of your sect's Cave Heaven True Lords. If he's also from the Lower Realms like you, I suggest befriending him."

"Understood. Thank you for the guidance, Master."

The man's demeanor instantly transformed, all traces of his earlier distress vanishing. Eventually, he discovered—to his astonishment—that his room was right next to Zhang Jing's.

"What serendipity," he murmured, a curious smile playing on his lips.

Not far from Zhang Jing's quarters, another door quietly opened. A plain-faced figure emerged, gaze fixed intently on Zhang Jing's room.

"Zhang Jing... he's here too? Just to observe, or..." You Yuanming pondered.

From what he'd learned, elite disciples like Zhang Jing typically spent a century or two consolidating their Foundation Establishment realm before competing for top rankings in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm. Showing up now defied convention—but then again, recalling Zhang Jing's monstrous performances back at Dragon Lake Academy in the Lower Realm, You Yuanming's confidence wavered. When had his former junior brother ever followed conventional expectations?

"Junior Brother You, what has caught your attention?" a voice inquired from an adjacent door.

"Senior Brother, I merely spotted an acquaintance from my time in the Lower Realms," You Yuanming replied with a smile.

"Ah, another visitor here for the spectacle then. It seems great minds think alike," the senior brother chuckled.

You Yuanming laughed along, though a complex emotion flickered in his eyes. 

*For the spectacle... perhaps.*

---

Time flowed onward until one day, on the Void Treasure Ship's bow deck, cultivators stood scattered about in small groups, chatting with expressions ranging from envy to excitement. Among them, Zhang Jing stood alone in an open area, hands clasped behind his back as he gazed contemplatively into the dark void.

Before long, the golden-robed figure appeared nearby. "Brother Zhang, what occupies your thoughts?"

"Nothing in particular—just clearing my mind," Zhang Jing replied with a faint smile before turning. "Brother Qu finally emerges from seclusion?"

Two months had passed since their first meeting, during which Zhang Jing had grown familiar with this man—Qu Junhou, also hailing from the Lower Realm's Jun Tianyu region and the Chiwu Tribe. Like Zhang Jing, he'd gained entry to the Upper Realm by mastering the Aurora Magnetic Sea technique, arriving around the same time.

Their eyes met, and simultaneously, both thought: *What a monster!*

Zhang Jing knew his achievements stemmed largely from the mysterious jade talisman. Without it, he might still be struggling in Dragon Lake Academy, let alone standing here confident of claiming the top Foundation Establishment spot.

Unbeknownst to him, Qu Junhou harbored similar thoughts. Without his master's guidance, he'd still be languishing in some Lower Realm backwater. Zhang Jing's feat of breaking into the True Spirit Ranking's top ten through sheer talent alone remained seared into his memory—an utterly abnormal achievement that justified his master's insistence on befriending the man.

*Though your talent is monstrous, Brother Zhang, don't blame me for what's coming,* Qu Junhou mused cheerfully. *My master's guidance gives me a slight edge when we eventually clash in the secret realm—perfectly fair, wouldn't you say?*

Suddenly—

*BOOM!*

The Void Treasure Ship shuddered violently. Both men whirled toward the bow, expressions shifting to horror.

Before them, the previously calm void had transformed into a raging storm spanning countless miles, its distorted, violent energy making even the massive ship seem like insignificant dust before an avalanche. 

Worse still—

Zhang Jing's gaze lifted higher, his mind reeling. Above the endless storm, the faint outline of a colossal demonic wing had appeared, beneath which he seemed to glimpse a magnificent world of mountains and seas.

"Mountain... Sea... Butterfly," Qu Junhou whispered beside him.
