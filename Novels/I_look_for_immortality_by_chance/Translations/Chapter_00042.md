# Chapter 42: The Giant and the Decree Arrow (Combined)

"Huff!"

A stream of white mist exhaled from Gu Yuan's mouth, lingering in the air before striking the hard stone wall and leaving a crack. His face was flushed, his internal spiritual energy surging violently. The dantian within him was shrouded in swirling mist, seemingly expanded by several degrees, his spiritual power growing increasingly profound.

After a long while, he slowly opened his eyes, a smile of joy appearing at the corners of his mouth.

"Sixth level of Qi Refinement!"

"My spiritual power has doubled, my spiritual sense has expanded from ten zhang to fifteen zhang, and the power of the heavens and earth that my seals can summon has also increased by several degrees."

Feeling the surging spiritual energy within him and the limits of his spiritual sense, Gu Yuan's smile grew even wider.

The journey to the Cloud Cliff Shell Field had already yielded substantial rewards. In just half a day, his cultivation had advanced by a minor realm, saving him over a year of arduous cultivation.

"Though combat and exploration are fraught with danger, the rewards, if obtained, can far surpass those of solitary cultivation," Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh.

"However, breaking through to the sixth level of Qi Refinement is only the first step of the plan. There are more important matters awaiting me."

After another round of breathing exercises to harmonize and consolidate his spiritual energy, Gu Yuan didn't hesitate. He activated his seals, summoned the Jade Dragon Flying Shuttle, and swiftly departed from the fifth layer of the water cavern before plunging straight down toward the sixth layer.

---

The scenery in the sixth layer of the water cavern was entirely different. The entire cavern was completely enveloped by water currents. Moreover, thick water veins swept through the cavern like massive whips, carrying an overwhelming force.

The power of these water currents was no longer something Gu Yuan's ordinary mid-grade Daoist robe could withstand. He had to continuously form a protective barrier with his spiritual energy to keep the water at bay.

"It's a pity I don't have a Water Repelling Seal or a magical artifact. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to endure this hardship," Gu Yuan sighed slightly as he observed the clear, turbulent, and seemingly endless water currents around him.

Without a Water Repelling Seal or artifact, he had to rely on his own spiritual energy to maintain a barrier against the water pressure, which consumed twenty percent of his energy for no good reason.

Before heading to the shell field, Gu Yuan had considered crafting a Water Repelling Seal or purchasing a Water Repelling artifact. However, his pockets were empty. Moreover, the materials for such artifacts or seals had skyrocketed in price due to the shell field expedition, leaving him with no choice but to abandon the idea.

"Fortunately, Kuang Mingsheng gifted me a Void Jade. With this jade, I should be able to search for opportunities without hindrance."

Clutching the cool, transparent jade pendant in his palm, Gu Yuan couldn't help but smile again.

This was the plan he had devised on the treasure ship.

---

If he lacked magical artifacts or treasures, it didn't matter—as long as his enemies had them. This was the essence of sustaining war through war.

The Void Jade truly lived up to its reputation as a stealth treasure for Qi Refinement cultivators. Despite the commotion caused by Gu Yuan's spiritual barrier pushing aside the water currents, the jade enveloped the surrounding space in silence. To anyone observing with their eyes or spiritual sense, the water would appear perfectly calm, with no anomalies in sight.

Since he had to maintain the water-repelling barrier, Gu Yuan didn't dare to fully activate his seals, fearing it would expose his presence. He could only proceed northward at a steady, unhurried pace.

Fortunately, cultivators, bolstered by their spiritual energy, were not physically weak. With the minor activation of his "Chasing Moon Seal," Gu Yuan didn't take long to approach his destination.

"Kill this serpent, fellow disciples! Unleash your seals without restraint!"

Along the way, Gu Yuan encountered several battles. Perhaps due to his advancement to the sixth level of Qi Refinement, or the increased experience in deceitful encounters, or simply his straightforward Daoist heart, these battles were all straightforward, with cultivators cooperating seamlessly and no underhanded tactics occurring.

Gu Yuan had no intention of participating. He glided past quietly, focused solely on reaching his opportunity.

Just before reaching his destination, another fierce battle erupted ahead. A three-zhang-long green serpent was locked in combat with four cultivators in blue robes.

Over a dozen seals flashed simultaneously, and several magical artifacts roared in unison. Yet, the green serpent's scales lit up with patterns, as if clad in a radiant green mantle, stubbornly resisting the onslaught.

"Damn it! This Green Tungsten Serpent must have been nourished by True Dragon's blood. Its demonic patterns are incredibly resilient, blocking the combined attacks of four of us!" The leader, a young man with a scar near his eye and graying temples, was known for his tenacity and composure. But even he couldn't hide his grim expression at the sight of the serpent's glowing scales.

"I've heard that when a giant whale falls in the East Sea, life flourishes in its wake. When a True Dragon perishes, its blood scatters across the world, and some lucky demonic beasts benefit from it," a curvaceous and beautiful female cultivator behind him said, pursing her lips.

"True, but it's still just a demonic beast, not one of the East Sea's dragon descendants. We can wear it down to death."

"Still, prolonged combat is risky. This serpent is a treasure trove, more valuable than the Shell King. We must kill it to gather enough resources for the Zhongshan Secret Ruins!"

"Enough waiting! Cover me while I activate my secret seal!" The scarred young man frowned, scanning his surroundings with an inexplicable sense of unease. After a moment's hesitation, he made up his mind and shouted to his companions.

"Leave it to us, Senior Brother!"

"We'll keep the serpent occupied!"

The others responded immediately.

---

Gu Yuan observed everything. When he heard "nourished by True Dragon's blood" and "Zhongshan Secret Ruins," his eyes flickered.

If True Dragon's blood could nourish demonic beasts, what about the blood of a True Immortal?

The Zhongshan Secret Ruins were the remnants of the fallen Zhongshan Kingdom. Gu Yuan's Four Spirit Jade Pillars were originally crafted by the Celestial Mechanism Pavilion, a treasure-refining sect from Zhongshan.

Though these tidbits piqued his interest, they didn't alter his course. He carefully skirted the battlefield and, after another half an incense stick's time, arrived at a silent cliff face submerged underwater.

The cliff was smooth, adorned only with a few tenacious water plants and occasional spirit fish nibbling on their seeds. It appeared utterly ordinary.

Yet, when Gu Yuan extended his spiritual sense, he detected something peculiar. An unseen force suppressed his senses, preventing him from probing the cliff accurately.

"Is the opportunity hidden behind this cliff? Is it hollow?" Gu Yuan mused, eyeing the unyielding rock face.

According to the Stone Liquid's guidance, the opportunity lay ahead. But with the cliff blocking the way, where was the path?

After ensuring no one was around, Gu Yuan increased his spiritual energy output, pushing the surrounding water away to create a dry space. He then pointed forward, summoning the Scarlet Flame Dragon Seal from his dantian. The seal morphed into a fierce, indistinct dragon shadow, slamming into the cliff with violent force.

"Boom!"

The cliff trembled slightly, cracks spiderwebbing across its surface.

"There's something here!" Gu Yuan's heart stirred. He unleashed the seal repeatedly, bombarding the cliff.

After several strikes, the cliff finally gave way, revealing a massive hole. Simultaneously, a powerful repulsive force surged from the opening, expelling all water within a thirty-zhang radius. The area behind the cliff and the hole was instantly dry.

Gu Yuan remained cautious. With a wave of his hand, the Scarlet Flame Dragon surged into the darkness, its fiery glow illuminating the long-sealed cavern.

The cavern wasn't vast—about ten zhang in all directions. At its center stood a stone platform holding a radiant emerald pearl. The pearl emitted a brilliant light, seemingly undimmed after centuries, and exuded a strong repulsive force that kept all water at bay.

Behind the platform lay a white jade bed, upon which sat the skeletal remains of a figure in a meditative pose. In its palm rested a green jade slip.

After scanning the area multiple times with his spiritual sense and confirming no threats, Gu Yuan cautiously stepped inside.

"Boom!"

At that moment, a deafening roar echoed from above, as if a beast were pounding the cavern's ceiling.

"Hahaha! As expected, I am the chosen one! To stumble upon such an opportunity!" A silver-haired, blue-eyed youth crashed down like a cannonball, his laughter brimming with arrogance.

But his mirth was short-lived.

"It's you!"

Old grudges resurfaced, distorting Lan Tianlu's voice.

"How are you here?!"

---

The same question echoed in Gu Yuan's mind. Despite possessing the Stone Liquid, advancing to the sixth level of Qi Refinement, and using the Void Jade to conceal his presence, he had still encountered Lan Tianlu here. How had this fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivator managed to break through the ceiling and land in this very spot?

Did Lan Tianlu also possess a Stone Liquid, capable of discerning worldly opportunities?

For a fleeting moment, Gu Yuan wondered who the true outsider was.

But all thoughts quickly coalesced into a scorching intent to kill.

This youth could not be allowed to live. His luck was terrifying.

"Roar!"

An invisible dragon's roar reverberated through the cavern as a spectral dragon, brimming with malice, lunged at Lan Tianlu's consciousness.

Lan Tianlu was equally baffled. How had Gu Yuan gotten here? Had this thief also stumbled upon such fortune? And he was already at the sixth level of Qi Refinement? Had he stolen the Shell King from the fifth layer?

Initially confident in facing Gu Yuan—a mere lucky bumpkin from a backwater sect—Lan Tianlu had believed his years of accumulated resources would prevail, even without the Lan family's backing. But Gu Yuan's advancement to the sixth level unsettled him.

Yet, touching the spirit beast pouch at his waist renewed his confidence.

Before he could utter a threat, Gu Yuan struck with ruthless efficiency. The dragon's roar assaulted his mind, destabilizing his spiritual sense and nearly toppling him.

Gone was the scholarly demeanor from their previous encounter. Gu Yuan had shed all pretense of civility.

"Spirit Dragon Heavenly Water!"

"Good thing I came prepared!"

"Today is your death day, thief!"

The spectral dragon struck with terrifying speed. Lan Tianlu, aware of its lethality, dared not face it head-on. Though he had consumed Green Crane Spirit Water, granting him a crane's spiritual sense, it was no match for the dragon's malevolence.

"Soul-Guarding Bell!"

He slapped his waist, releasing a small purple bell that emitted layers of violet light, forming an intangible barrier against the dragon.

"Clang!"

But before the bell could fully deploy, a golden ring shot forth like shackles, immobilizing it.

"Oh no!"

The spectral dragon plunged into Lan Tianlu's consciousness.

"Ahh!"

Agony seared through his mind as if his soul were being torn apart. Beads of sweat poured from his forehead.

The spiritual sense barrier was the first hurdle in cultivation. Lan Tianlu had sought supreme-grade spirit water precisely for this reason. The spiritual sense born from such water was inherently domineering, suppressing others' senses like a supreme-grade seal.

Had Gu Yuan remained at the fifth level, Lan Tianlu might have withstood the assault. But now, with Gu Yuan at the sixth level, his spiritual sense had surged, akin to a half-grown dragon mauling an immature crane. The outcome was inevitable.

"Ahh!"

Lan Tianlu screamed in torment, fumbling for a Soul-Strengthening Pill to counter Gu Yuan's assault. But before he could act, an all-encompassing mist enveloped him.

Within the mist, fiery dragons, icy chains, a treasure mirror, and a spellsword materialized, accompanied by the sound of pouring rain, all converging on Lan Tianlu.

"Pfft!"

Blinded by the mist, Lan Tianlu couldn't perceive the attacks, but his instincts screamed of imminent death.

Holding back now meant certain doom.

Biting his tongue, he forced himself to clarity and activated all his seals and artifacts.

Only seven seals of varying hues responded, but they lasted mere moments.

The torrential rain within the mist suppressed all seals except Gu Yuan's, and the ambient spiritual energy they could harness was pitifully scarce.

Within three breaths, the seven seals dimmed and retreated into his dantian.

His spiritual sense, body, and energy were all sapped by an unnatural fatigue.

Death loomed.

But the seven seals had bought him a sliver of time.

Trembling, Lan Tianlu reached for his waist and consumed the treasure he had obtained in the White Worm Frost Prison.

"Boom!"

Instantly, a surge of blood essence and terrifying strength erupted, repelling even the spectral dragon from his consciousness with an overwhelming force field.

"Clang!"

A cyan spellsword, razor-sharp, stabbed at Lan Tianlu's brow—only to rebound with a crisp chime.

A massive hand, swift as lightning, seized the blade.

"Buzz!"

The sword wailed, struggling to break free.

But the hand's grip was immovable, its strength mountainous. An extreme chill seeped into the blade, freezing its runes and severing its spiritual energy flow.

Deprived of energy, the sword was mere metal. The hand crushed it into icy-blue shards.

The fiery dragon and icy chain seals struck Lan Tianlu's body, leaving only faint black marks before dissipating.

"Gu Yuan, you thief!!"

"I owe my current state to you!"

"Today, I'll repay the favor!"

A thunderous voice boomed.

Within the mist, Lan Tianlu had transformed completely.

From a seven-foot-tall, handsome youth, he had become a ten-foot-tall behemoth with ice-blue hair and skin. Blue demonic patterns sprawled across his neck and cheeks, radiating an eerie glow.

Lan Tianlu had somehow assumed a giant form, his voice like thunder, his strength like a mountain. A strange force field surrounded him, repelling all spiritual senses.

The mist thickened, the rain poured, seeking to trap him.

But Lan Tianlu exhaled a freezing gale, icing the rain midair and solidifying the mist.

"Bang!"

A single punch shattered the mist.

Though the Moving Clouds and Rain Seal was a secret art, continuously drawing energy to replenish the mist and rain, it couldn't withstand Lan Tianlu's assault.

"Just a mere secret seal!"

"Do you think this can stop me?!"

"Gu Yuan, today is your death day!"

The giant Lan Tianlu seemed to have grown more volatile, roaring as he pummeled the mist with fists like thunder, exhaling frost with each strike.

"Break!"

Hundreds of punches later, the sheer force disrupted the very air, shaking the spiritual energy.

The Moving Clouds and Rain Seal finally succumbed, dispersing with a mournful hum.

"Gu Yuan, prepare to die!"

Lan Tianlu burst through the mist, charging at Gu Yuan with a savage grin.

But Gu Yuan merely regarded him calmly.

In his hand, a peculiar seal pulsed like a volcano on the verge of eruption, its power suppressed yet growing ever more intense.

One hundred and thirty-six formation patterns blazed with dazzling light.

"Boom!"
