# Chapter 13: Breakthroughs One After Another

Returning to his small hut, Gu Mo decided to devote all his energy to cultivation in order to reach the Qi Refining stage as soon as possible. Only by entering the Qi Refining stage could he begin his subsequent plans, such as joining the Spirit Plant Hall or saving up Sun Essence to purchase new Sunflowers.

Time passed swiftly in cultivation. During this period, many servant disciples had already broken through to the Qi Refining stage. Those who achieved this breakthrough at this time were considered the elite among the current batch of servant disciples.

"Hmm?"

One day, just as Gu Mo had collected his daily Sun Essence and was preparing to cultivate, he received a paper crane message. The sender was Chu Feifei, who requested his presence for a chat.

"Could she have already succeeded in her breakthrough?" Gu Mo calculated the time—it matched exactly with the breakthrough period Chu Feifei had mentioned earlier. But if she had succeeded, why didn't she gather everyone in the canteen's private room to celebrate? Instead, she was asking him to come to her hut.

Though puzzled, Gu Mo still got up and headed to Chu Feifei's hut.

*Knock knock!*

"Who is it?"

Chu Feifei's cautious voice came from inside. After confirming that no one else was outside besides Gu Mo, she opened the door, quickly pulled him inside, and then tightly shut the door behind them.

As soon as Gu Mo was dragged inside, a rich and peculiar fragrance assaulted his senses. The scent was so overwhelming that his expression twisted. The aroma carried a refreshing clarity that sharpened the mind, a provocative sweetness that stirred the blood, and a drowsy warmth that lulled one to sleep—all these effects hit him at once.

Completely unprepared, Gu Mo was momentarily stunned. It took him several breaths to regain his composure. Looking at Chu Feifei, who now resembled a celestial fairy, and sensing the fluctuations of spiritual energy around her, he finally understood the reason.

Chu Feifei had broken through to the Qi Refining stage. The marrow-cleansing and meridian-forging effects of the breakthrough had activated her special constitution—this time, more intensely than before.

This state had persisted for three days already. During this time, Chu Feifei hadn't dared to leave her hut, which she had sealed tightly with various objects to prevent the fragrance from leaking out.

But staying indoors indefinitely wasn't an option. Although she had reached the Qi Refining stage, Chu Feifei hadn't yet achieved inedia. The fasting pills the sect had provided had long been exhausted, leaving her no choice but to seek help from Gu Mo, the only person who knew the secret of her constitution.

After understanding the situation, Gu Mo immediately handed over his own fasting pills. He had only taken one pill to taste it and hadn't used the rest since. With Sun Essence, his cultivation hardly required any time investment, so he had ample opportunity to eat at the canteen. Even the regular meals there tasted far better than the fasting pills, which were typically used by cultivators who hadn't achieved inedia and wished to focus solely on rigorous training.

Rumor had it that mid- to high-grade fasting pills tasted much better, but they were also more expensive. Naturally, the sect wouldn't distribute such pills to servant disciples.

Amid Chu Feifei's gratitude, Gu Mo quickly left the hut. The chaotic mix of fragrances inside was simply too torturous.

However, if Chu Feifei could learn to control the scents her body emitted, the effects of the different aromas could prove immensely useful. For instance, the scent that sharpened the mind would undoubtedly be a great aid in cultivating mental-type techniques. The other fragrances also held potential for development.

Unfortunately, Chu Feifei currently had no control over the scents her body released.

With the fasting pills Gu Mo provided, Chu Feifei secluded herself in her hut for an entire month before the fragrances finally dissipated completely. During this time, leveraging the fivefold cultivation boost from her awakened special constitution, she made significant progress within the first level of the Qi Refining stage.

By the time Chu Feifei sent Gu Mo a message updating him on her condition, he was just one step away from the Qi Refining stage himself. However, he chose not to attempt the breakthrough immediately. The marrow-cleansing effects of his perfected-level Cleaning Technique were still active, and he intended to wait a while longer to maximize the benefits of his breakthrough.

Around this time, news arrived that Wu Jinfei had successfully broken through. The four of them gathered in the canteen's private room to celebrate Wu Jinfei and Chu Feifei's breakthroughs. Chu Feifei had broken through a month prior, but due to her special circumstances, she had only informed Gu Mo. Now that the fragrances had faded, she publicly announced her breakthrough.

Unaware of the details, Wu Jinfei was pleased to learn that Chu Feifei had broken through around the same time as him—even a few hours later, in fact. This reassured him that he was still the second in their group to reach the Qi Refining stage.

"Hu Hai, Gu Mo, you two need to step it up. Don't keep us waiting too long," Wu Jinfei said with a triumphant air.

Gu Mo smiled and nodded in response. The Spirit Plant Hall he intended to join wasn't particularly competitive, so timing wasn't an issue for him. In contrast, Hu Hai's desired destination, the Alchemy Peak, was fiercely competitive, making him the most anxious of the group.

As soon as the celebration ended, Hu Hai hurried back to resume his cultivation.

"Gu Mo, thank you."

Before leaving, Chu Feifei expressed her gratitude once more. Gu Mo had been a tremendous help to her. Without him, she couldn't imagine how much worse her situation might have been.

"We're friends, aren't we? Who knows, I might need your help in the future," Gu Mo said with a dismissive wave. If Chu Feifei could resolve the issues with her constitution, she might very well become the one among them to progress the farthest.

---

Of course, that didn't include Gu Mo himself. With his Sunflowers and the Black Mist Space, he was confident he wouldn't be left behind either.

"Of course!"

Chu Feifei smiled and waved at Gu Mo before gracefully departing.

At this point, only Gu Mo and Hu Hai remained in their original group. A month later, the two met again in the canteen's private room—but this time, it wasn't to celebrate Hu Hai's successful breakthrough.

Hu Hai had failed. While breaking through to the Qi Refining stage wasn't particularly difficult with the resources provided by the sect, the innate limitations of his inferior spiritual roots still carried a chance of failure.

"It's just one failure. There's still plenty of time—just try again," Gu Mo consoled the dejected Hu Hai.

Failure to break through to the Qi Refining stage didn't have any severe side effects. A few days of rest were all that was needed. In fact, the experience of failure could even increase the chances of success in subsequent attempts. It was only at higher realms that breakthrough failures could cause irreversible damage.

The real challenge now was Hu Hai's mindset. If he lost his drive because of this setback, he might remain stuck here indefinitely.

"I know."

Hu Hai nodded, but the blow from this failure still weighed heavily on him. The Alchemy Peak had high recruitment standards, and this failure had significantly reduced his chances of being accepted.

"Here I am, someone who hasn't even attempted a breakthrough yet, comforting someone who's already tried once. Is there no justice in this world?" Gu Mo said with mock exasperation.

"Ah, Gu Mo, don't lose heart. I'm sure you'll succeed," Hu Hai replied, his face flushing slightly at Gu Mo's words.

Indeed, by all rights, Gu Mo—the one with the worst innate talent among them—should have been the one in need of encouragement.

"Alright, go back and cultivate. Once you succeed, share your insights with me so I can improve my own chances," Gu Mo said, waving him off.

"Alright!"

Hu Hai took a deep breath and nodded firmly.

Half a month later, Hu Hai attempted another breakthrough—and succeeded. "Gu Mo, thank you!" he exclaimed excitedly when they met again in the canteen's private room.

True to their agreement, Hu Hai shared all his breakthrough insights with Gu Mo. "Gu Mo, I know you can do it," he said encouragingly before immediately setting off for the Alchemy Peak. He had already delayed for half a month and couldn't afford to linger any longer.

With Hu Hai's departure, the original group of five was now reduced to just Gu Mo.
