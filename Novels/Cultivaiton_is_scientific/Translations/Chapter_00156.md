# Chapter 156: Returning to the Sect  

Li Shimin placed the six corpses into a storage bag. If not for his current inability to refine more corpse puppets, he would have considered turning Du Bingyan's body into one.  

This was the corpse of a genius cultivator, a peak Qi Refinement cultivator at that. Once refined, it would almost certainly become a high-quality Bronze Corpse.  

However, he currently had no intention of raising more corpse puppets. Their usefulness to him was no longer as critical as before.  

Moreover, he needed to report this matter to the sect. Elder Song of the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion had assured him that the Holy Ice Sect would not attack him—these six corpses were the evidence.  

He first completed the formation he was working on. Having lost interest in constructing any more formations for the day, he retrieved his flying boat and returned to the sect.  

On the way, he began inspecting his spoils of war.  

The storage bags of the five ordinary cultivators held nothing particularly noteworthy, as expected.  

Such cultivators were fortunate to possess one or two ordinary-grade high-tier magical artifacts. Given Li Shimin’s current wealth, such items were hardly worth his attention.  

However, Du Bingyan’s storage bag yielded a surprising discovery.  

"Another Foundation Establishment Pill!" Li Shimin muttered to himself as he opened a porcelain vial to confirm its contents.  

He couldn’t understand why someone would carry such a precious pill while out on a mission.  

In truth, it made perfect sense. For Qi Refinement cultivators, the Foundation Establishment Pill was an invaluable treasure—one they would naturally keep close for safekeeping.  

Moreover, Du Bingyan had been supremely confident in his ability to protect himself. To him, nowhere was safer than his own storage bag.  

"Five now!" Li Shimin stored the pill away, pleased.  

In the entire sect, only a dozen or so Foundation Establishment Pills were refined every five years. He alone now possessed nearly half that amount.  

But he wasn’t about to complain about having too many. Elder Yin had warned him to stock up on these pills.  

Before attempting his breakthrough, he needed to gather as many as possible to maximize his chances of success.  

If his spiritual roots were lacking, he would compensate with sheer quantity—enough pills to brute-force his way into Foundation Establishment.  

Du Bingyan had also gifted him a new jade flying boat, superior in quality to his previous one. It was likely a sect-provided treasure reserved for genius cultivators.  

There was also an ultra-grade sword artifact, though it was water-attribute and ice-aligned, making it unsuitable for Li Shimin.  

The rest consisted of spirit stones and a few high-quality backup magical artifacts.  

As he tallied his gains, the flying boat arrived at the Nine Peaks of the sect.  

---  

He landed the boat at the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion and entered.  

"Li Shimin, the mission couldn’t have been completed this quickly, could it?" Elder Song was surprised to see him.  

She had been monitoring the progress of his assigned task. Though his construction speed was unexpectedly fast, he still had a significant portion left to complete.  

"Greetings, Elder Song. I was attacked by cultivators from the Holy Ice Sect—they pinpointed my location with precision." As he spoke, Li Shimin handed over the storage bag.  

Elder Song’s gaze sharpened. She snatched the bag and swept it with her spiritual sense.  

No further proof was needed. The moment she saw Du Bingyan’s corpse, she knew Li Shimin spoke the truth.  

"This is my oversight. I will report it to the sect. Additionally, while you’re setting up formations, I will request the sect to assign you a protection mission," Elder Song said, her expression grim.  

Truthfully, seeing Du Bingyan’s corpse had shocked her.  

Genius cultivators were the sect’s most carefully nurtured disciples.  

Their combat prowess was among the strongest in their realm. Defeating one was possible, but killing one was far more difficult—unless a Foundation Establishment cultivator intervened.  

Clearly, no sect Foundation Establishment cultivator had assisted Li Shimin in killing Du Bingyan.  

"Elder Song, once Du Bingyan’s corpse has served as evidence, I’d like it returned. I plan to refine it into a corpse puppet," Li Shimin said. Though he had no immediate plans to do so, he wasn’t about to hand over the corpse for free.  

"Du Bingyan was a key disciple of the Holy Ice Sect. Killing him in self-defense is one thing, but refining him into a puppet? The Holy Ice Sect would never allow it," Elder Song replied coldly, giving him a sidelong glance.  

Li Shimin sensed something odd—Elder Song seemed to dislike him.  

This subtle hostility was only detectable after prolonged interaction. As a high-level formation master, her mental and spiritual defenses were formidable, making it difficult for him to read her emotions.  

But the faint impression made him wonder if Elder Song had deliberately set him up.  

The mission to construct a hundred formations appeared beneficial, helping him earn Foundation Establishment Pills faster. Yet it also took him far from the sect’s protection, exposing him to danger.  

Elder Song couldn’t have known about his Split Soul Surveillance technique, which allowed him to monitor his surroundings while setting up formations.  

"Please include my request when reporting to the sect," Li Shimin insisted.  

Elder Song’s explanation didn’t convince him. What did it matter if the Holy Ice Sect objected? They had repeatedly tried to kill him—was he not even allowed to use the corpses of his enemies to strengthen himself?  

"I’ll relay your request. For now, don’t resume your mission. A protection assignment should be issued within two days," Elder Song said dismissively, waving him off.  

Li Shimin bowed and left the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion. Inside, Elder Song’s expression darkened.  

She truly disliked Li Shimin—not for any personal reason, but because of Zhuo Xuan.  

Zhuo Xuan had been traveling with Li Shimin when they were ambushed. Zhuo Xuan died, while Li Shimin survived.  

Though Elder Song and Zhuo Xuan had never married, they had long been pledged to each other. Upon learning of Zhuo Xuan’s death, she had volunteered to oversee the sect’s defensive formations.  

Under the pretext of preparing for a major crisis, she had pushed through a series of formation upgrades—some genuinely beneficial to the sect, others serving her own agenda.  

The mission to construct a hundred formations had taken Li Shimin far from the sect’s safety. Elder Song was well aware of the risks involved.  

While the Holy Ice Sect wouldn’t send Foundation Establishment cultivators after him, conflicts between Qi Refinement cultivators were tacitly permitted by all sects. Death in such battles was simply a reflection of one’s inadequacy.  

Elder Song suppressed her darker thoughts. She had no intention of acting herself—nor any need to.  

Li Shimin’s combat prowess was unexpectedly formidable. Until the current crisis was resolved, the Holy Ice Sect wouldn’t risk inter-sect conflict by sending Foundation Establishment assassins after him.  

"Zhuo Xuan… Why did he live while you died? Not even your body remained…" Clutching the storage bag, Elder Song whispered bitterly, unable to let go of her grief.  

---  

Li Shimin had no idea how the Heavenly Sea Sect and Holy Ice Sect resolved the matter.  

Two days later, Elder Yin came to see him.  

"Shimin, take this." As soon as they met, Elder Yin tossed him a box.  

Puzzled, Li Shimin caught it. When he opened it, a wave of cold air made him shiver. Fortunately, his robust physique shielded him from harm.  

"What is this?" he asked hesitantly.  

Even without knowing what it was, he could tell the item inside was extraordinary—both in quality and value.  

"Forget about Du Bingyan’s corpse. This is the Holy Ice Sect’s compensation—a second-grade Thousand-Year Cold Crystal. It’s enough to refine a spirit artifact," Elder Yin said gruffly.  

To secure justice for Li Shimin, he had personally visited the Holy Ice Sect.  

Only after obtaining their explicit guarantee and this compensation—and considering the need for unity against their common enemy—did he let the matter rest.  

"Thank you, Uncle Yin!" Li Shimin knew Elder Yin must have fought hard on his behalf. A mere corpse wouldn’t have warranted such valuable compensation—this was clearly the result of Elder Yin’s bargaining.  

"Too bad it’s not metal-attribute," he muttered as he stored the box away.  

"Metal-attribute? Brat, you don’t know what you’re talking about! A second-grade Thousand-Year Cold Crystal refined into an auxiliary spirit artifact can enhance cultivation speed during Foundation Establishment! If we hadn’t been in the right, do you think the Holy Ice Sect would’ve handed this over? With your aptitude, your cultivation speed at Foundation Establishment will be painfully slow. This might give you a sliver of hope!" Elder Yin scolded, jabbing a finger at him.  

To a Golden Core cultivator, a second-grade Thousand-Year Cold Crystal wasn’t particularly valuable.  

But it was a specialty of the Holy Ice Sect, produced in minuscule quantities and reserved only for their most promising Foundation Establishment disciples.  

Its primary value lay in its ability to aid Foundation Establishment cultivation—boosting efficiency and reducing the risk of qi deviation.  

The Holy Ice Sect would never have parted with it if not for Elder Yin’s influence—and their assumption that Li Shimin was his son-in-law.  

Of course, the compensation ultimately came from Elder Bai. The sect’s other two Golden Core elders were less than pleased with him.  

Most importantly, Elder Yin had tacitly allowed the Holy Ice Sect to believe in Li Shimin’s fabricated status to secure the crystal.  

"You can resume your formation mission. The Holy Ice Sect won’t dare act against you now. As a precaution, a cultivator will be assigned to protect you," Elder Yin concluded.  

He was puzzled by the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion’s failure to provide protection for an outbound mission. Normally, formation masters venturing beyond the sect—unless they were Foundation Establishment cultivators themselves—were always assigned guards.  

But given that the pavilion’s current overseer was newly rotated in, perhaps it was just an administrative oversight.  

---  

When Li Shimin left the sect this time, he was accompanied by another Qi Refinement cultivator.  

His companion was He Chuan, a ninth-level Qi Refinement cultivator. Though not yet at peak Qi Refinement, his spiritual energy was exceptionally dense—a clear sign of a sect-nurtured genius.  

"Junior Brother Li, you formation masters are truly wealthy. This flying boat is even better than mine!" He Chuan said cheerfully, displaying none of the aloofness typical of geniuses.  

"You’re mistaken, Senior Brother He. Formation masters aren’t rich—this boat was a gift from a friend," Li Shimin explained with a smile.  

"Was it from Senior Sister Yin?" He Chuan asked with a teasing grin.  

Li Shimin instinctively took a step back, unnerved by He Chuan’s overly familiar demeanor.  

He Chuan was older than Yin Shiran yet addressed her as "Senior Sister."  

What Li Shimin didn’t know was that He Chuan’s status as a genius cultivator was the only reason he could call her that. Even the sect leader referred to Yin Shiran as "Junior Sister."  

"No, it wasn’t. Stop prying," Li Shimin said, waving him off.  

"Junior Brother Li, the person who gave you this boat must be a woman. You’re in trouble—I’m telling Senior Sister Yin when we get back!" He Chuan said, waggling his eyebrows.  

For some reason, Li Shimin felt a pang of guilt—though he quickly dismissed it. Why should he feel guilty?  

"We’re almost there. Get ready," Li Shimin said, changing the subject.  

"You set up the formation here. I’ll lay some traps around the perimeter," He Chuan said, suddenly all business.  

Li Shimin didn’t rely solely on He Chuan for protection. Using his Split Soul Surveillance technique, he dispersed eight soul fragments to monitor the surroundings.  

Throughout the formation’s construction, He Chuan remained silent, periodically patrolling the skies and keeping watch.  

Only when Li Shimin finished one formation and moved to the next location did He Chuan revert to his earlier demeanor.  

"Junior Brother, I heard you killed Du Bingyan?" He Chuan asked quietly as they boarded the flying boat.  

Before accepting the mission, he had inquired about Li Shimin’s capabilities through his connections. He found it hard to believe that a mid-level formation master could defeat Du Bingyan.  

"Yes. He was quite skilled," Li Shimin admitted frankly.  

He wasn’t lying. Had Du Bingyan not tried to ambush him, defeating him without using his Soul Jade Sword’s spiritual attack would have taken considerable effort.  

"If you could kill Du Bingyan, why did the sect assign me to protect you?" He Chuan grumbled.  

He had fought Du Bingyan before. Geniuses from the seven major sects often crossed paths during overlapping missions.  

Their battle had ended in a stalemate, with neither able to gain the upper hand.  

The difference between top-tier Qi Refinement cultivators was minimal. Killing an opponent was exceedingly difficult without a one-hit-kill technique.  

"I’m a formation master—I need to focus on setting up formations. Besides, isn’t earning merit points from missions a good thing?" Li Shimin replied nonchalantly.  

"By the way, have you heard? There’s an invasion force at Seven Stars Island. The sect’s recent formation upgrades are related to that," He Chuan said, switching topics to show off his insider knowledge.  

He wasn’t worried about leaking sect secrets. Li Shimin was practically Elder Yin’s son-in-law—the same Elder Yin who had extorted a hefty compensation from the Holy Ice Sect’s Elder Bai using that very connection.  

Cultivation was tedious, and He Chuan loved gossip. Normally, his fellow geniuses already knew whatever news he had, leaving him no one to impress.
