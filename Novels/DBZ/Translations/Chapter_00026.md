# Chapter 26: The Ascent of Immortal Path

"Boom!" A tremendous explosion erupted from Blackwind Ridge.

Within the courtyard, the anxious third brother of the Sang family leapt to his feet. 

"Eldest brother, second brother, what's happened to you?" murmured Sang the Third.

Ever since earlier, he had been experiencing intermittent stabbing pains in his heart, as if he had lost someone dear to him. This sensation filled him with dread, conjuring images of terrible scenarios.

"It's not real, none of this is real. Eldest brother is at the sixth layer of Qi Refining, second brother at the fifth—how could anything happen to them?" 

"They must have defeated their enemies—yes, that must be it!"

With these words, he forced himself to calm down through sheer willpower.

Also present in the courtyard was a young, clean-cut male cultivator sitting quietly to one side, appearing as though he were a guest invited here. However, the shackles visible beneath his robes on his wrists and feet revealed his true status as a prisoner.

This cultivator was none other than Lu Ping, the talisman master.

At this moment, his mind was racing: "What exactly is happening? Have the Sang brothers' enemies come for revenge?"

Though the Sang brothers who had kidnapped him seemed to be in serious trouble, Lu Ping showed little joy at the prospect. He couldn't be sure that their enemies would treat him any better than the Sang brothers had. After all, the Sangs still had use for him and wouldn't kill him—for now.

"If forced, I might have to reveal some of my potential. Surely anyone with half a brain would recognize my value."

At this thought, Lu Ping couldn't help but sigh. Exposing his talents was truly a last resort, but if his life was at stake, he'd have no choice. Survival came first.

As for whether the intruders might be here to rescue him, Lu Ping didn't entertain the notion. He was a solitary person by nature, with few close friends—perhaps only Bai Fugui would consider coming to his aid. But Bai's cultivation was too weak; coming to Blackwind Ridge would be suicide.

Yet sometimes, fate enjoys playing such cruel jokes.

*Cough! Cough!* Wei Qian dashed out through billowing smoke. 

The fire was spreading rapidly, and even with his superhuman physique, moving through the inferno was extremely uncomfortable. However, thinking of the treasures now stored in his pouch brought an irrepressible smile to his face.

"The horse grows fat on night grass, and men grow rich on windfalls!" How true that saying was!

The "generosity" of the eldest and second Sang brothers moved Wei Qian nearly to tears. Had Second Brother Sang not activated all his talismans in his final moments, Wei Qian's haul would have been even greater. 

Even so, he'd acquired four upper-tier first-grade talismans, sixteen other talismans, two mid-grade magical artifacts, and one hundred forty-six lower-grade spirit stones.

"I owe this success entirely to the mid-grade Frostlight Needle artifact," Wei Qian acknowledged clearly. At the Qi Refining stage, such a weapon could only be described as "heaven-defying."

"Still, while effective against Qi Refining cultivators, this would be useless against true Foundation Establishment experts," Wei Qian mused. Foundation Establishment cultivators could extend their spiritual sense over wide areas, making sneak attacks far less effective.

But against the mid-Qi Refining Sang brothers, the Frostlight Needle had been terrifyingly lethal—a single touch meant death.

"Now to deal with the last one." With this thought, Wei Qian sped toward the courtyard, concerned that delay might endanger Lu Ping.

*Bang!* The alarm talisman on Third Brother Sang exploded, signaling an enemy's approach.

"Eldest brother! Second brother!" Third Brother Sang's eyes turned bloodshot as he rushed into the open courtyard, summoning a spike-shaped artifact from his pouch.

A dark streak shot toward him from the front, which he met head-on with his artifact. Simultaneously, a cold light flashed from behind, only to be blocked by a brocade handkerchief artifact he'd prepared in anticipation.

This Third Brother Sang was clearly an experienced fighter—entering the open space, he'd anticipated attacks from multiple directions and prepared accordingly.

"A fellow practitioner of ambush tactics," Wei Qian observed, recognizing a kindred spirit in the art of misdirection and surprise attacks.

"You killed my brothers! Dare to give your name?" Third Brother Sang roared.

"Hmm, a short, fat man escaped—was he your eldest or second brother?" Wei Qian replied casually.

Even as they exchanged words, their hands never stopped moving. Simultaneously, they activated two upper-tier first-grade Fire Lance talismans.

Two identical lances of flame materialized and shot toward each other.

The collision created a massive explosion, flames erupting in all directions.

"Tsk tsk, it's like fighting a mirror image," Wei Qian remarked. In many ways, Third Brother Sang was his doppelgänger.

Their greatest difference, perhaps, was that the Sang brother lacked a treasure like the Wish-Dragon Pearl.

In the world of cultivation, such disparities were common. Among countless cultivators, some were favored by heaven itself, blessed with divine artifacts that let them dominate their peers.

Wei Qian often modestly claimed he wasn't a heaven-blessed protagonist, but this was pure humility. With the Wish-Dragon Pearl, his "golden finger" was no less formidable than any legendary treasure. Without it, how could he wield such extraordinary power?

Fifteen minutes later, Third Brother Sang uttered his final words: "I... refuse to accept this." Then his corpse collapsed heavily to the ground.

Wei Qian exhaled deeply in satisfaction and immediately sat to recover his energy.

Half an hour later, he stood, gazing calmly at the fallen cultivator. Those dying words had struck a chord.

"This world is full of those who die unwilling. How many actually achieve their desires?"

"The path of immortality is fraught with tribulations, long and arduous..."

Wei Qian's musings were heartfelt. In the vast, boundless world of cultivation, across thousands upon thousands of years, what couldn't happen? Perhaps one day, he too might find himself in Third Brother Sang's position.

"But I will still climb, striving with all my might to ascend the immortal path as far as I can!"

With a flick of his finger, Wei Qian ignited Third Brother Sang's body, which was soon consumed by roaring flames.

Then he turned and strode toward the building.

The way of cultivation wasn't merely about combat—it was equally about human connections. Now to meet that talisman master Lu Ping. Gaining the friendship of a Blood Talisman Spirit Body practitioner would be an invaluable advantage!
