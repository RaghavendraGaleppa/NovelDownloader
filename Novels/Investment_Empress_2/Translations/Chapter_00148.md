# Chapter 148: The Upper-Shaped Painting is Ruined, Do I Have to Paint It Myself?

Ru Yi Peak, Bamboo Forest Residence.

This place was still bustling with activity ten minutes ago, but now it has become incredibly desolate.

For some reason, it suddenly became as deserted as a marketplace with no customers.

Li Mo sat inside the room, examining the various paintings within.

There were towering mountains and flowing rivers, "Spring Snow" melodies, portraits, and flying birds and running beasts—a wide variety of subjects.

All of them were masterpieces that could be used as God-Viewing Diagrams.

Of course, most were Lower-Shaped, with few being Middle-Shaped.

"Senior Brother Ouyang, if you paint God-Viewing Diagrams so well, why do you still have a side hustle?" Li Mo asked.

"Ah, Junior Brother, you have no idea how poor artists are," Ouyang said, opening up and pouring out his grievances.

A good God-Viewing Diagram isn't created in one go.

It requires a flash of inspiration and wastes a large amount of rare materials.

Even after it's painted, it might not necessarily find the right person to appreciate it.

For instance, that painting of "High Mountains and Flowing Water" contains the form and intent of mountains and rivers. It cost three thousand taels to make, but to this day, it hasn't found a suitable person to contemplate its intent. It can only sit here gathering dust.

After listening for a while, Li Mo fell into deep thought.

Why is it that even in a different world, artists still don't make much money?

"So, Senior Brother Ouyang, you had to find a side job to support your painting?" Li Mo asked.

"Not entirely," Ouyang said with a sly grin.

Li Mo: "Senior Brother, your drool is about to drip down."

"Oh, oh..." Ouyang wiped the corner of his mouth and straightened his expression. "Junior Brother, are you preparing for the God-Viewing Realm?"

Li Mo nodded. "I truly don't know what kind of form and intent I should contemplate."

"You came to the right person then!" Ouyang said confidently.

Li Mo was half-doubtful.

He had a feeling that Senior Brother Ouyang wasn't very reliable.

To be safe, he should use his Fate Providence Divine Eye to take a look first...

**[Name: Ouyang]**
**[Age: 27]**
**[Bone Grade: Divine Brush Master.]**
**[Realm: Four Apertures of the God-Viewing Realm.]**
**[Fate Providence: Blue-Grey]**
**[Evaluation: Born with a destitute fate, but after death, his paintings will be passed down and become world-famous. His unique understanding of the art of painting will gradually be appreciated by all.]**
**[Recent Encounter: To support the brothers of the Painting Academy, he often earns money through side jobs.]**

Li Mo: "..."

So, the biggest reason his paintings aren't valuable is that he's still alive?

However, not every painter's work becomes famous after their death.

Senior Brother Ouyang does have some skill.

"I have quite a few God-Viewing Diagrams here. Take a look, Junior Brother," Ouyang said. "If you can make the painting 'move,' it means you can carry the form and intent within it, making it suitable for you."

Move?

Li Mo didn't quite understand what he meant.

Ouyang stood up with a mysterious expression. "This is my unique method of the Dao of Painting. You'll understand soon."

He took a painting of a fierce tiger descending the mountain off the wall.

"This God-Viewing Diagram was the first one I ever created. It contains the intent of a tiger's roar echoing through the forest."

"Although it's only a Lower-Shaped diagram, those who contemplate this intent will, upon entering the God-Viewing Realm, have every movement carry the might of a tiger. It's incredibly powerful."

Li Mo raised an eyebrow slightly and focused his gaze on it.

His mind seemed to be drawn into the painting at that moment.

A vast, wild forest suddenly appeared before his eyes, shrouded in mist.

In a daze, Li Mo felt as if he had arrived deep within the mountains.

Vaguely, the leaves rustled, as if something was approaching...

A violent gust of wind rushed at him.

It was a striped tiger, its eyes half-open, carrying a ferocious aura as if it could devour a person.

One of its paws rested on a bluestone as it patrolled the forest—the king of beasts surveying its own territory!

Majestic and fierce, its vicious nature was fully exposed!

It scanned everything coldly, as if searching for prey.

It saw Li Mo!

It opened its blood-red maw!

It let out a roar:

"Meow..."

It lay down, its entire body trembling like a sieve, its fur standing on end in terror.

The fierce tiger instantly turned into a several-hundred-pound weak little kitten, as if it had seen some kind of terrifying monster.

Weak, pitiful, and helpless.

"This isn't right," Li Mo said, completely bewildered.

You need to stand your ground! How am I supposed to contemplate you if you don't stand your ground?

---

Little Li was confused. As his mind tried to get closer, the striped tiger grew even more terrified.

*Poof—*

It dissipated.

Li Mo: "..."

This is just莫名其妙 (unreasonable).

Is there something wrong with this God-Viewing Diagram?

At that very moment, the artistic conception was completely broken.

Li Mo opened his eyes and saw the God-Viewing Diagram. The ink inside was chaotic, as if someone had scribbled on it. It was clearly ruined.

He looked up and met Ouyang's stunned and bewildered gaze.

Senior Brother Ouyang was clearly doubting his own life.

"What's going on here?" Li Mo asked with a puzzled look.

"Junior Brother Li, are you really at the Inner Breath Realm?" Ouyang asked, his face full of heartache. He was lost in thought for a long time before asking.

Li Mo nodded. "I just reached the Xuan Dan stage not long ago."

"That's strange then," Ouyang said, frowning as he put away the painting of the tiger descending the mountain. "My 'Tiger Descending the Mountain' diagram wouldn't be destroyed even if my Master's soul entered it..."

He had shown this painting to other fellow disciples before.

Some couldn't withstand the tiger's might and were driven out, while others simply couldn't sink their minds into the painting.

Both situations indicated that the person was not qualified to carry the tiger's form and intent.

But what was this situation where the painting was ruined?

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Li Mo said, "How about we try again?"

Ouyang: "Huh?"

The painting they just tried cost over a thousand taels of silver to make.

His heart was bleeding right now.

Again?

But he had just confidently promised that it would be no problem.

If he backed out now, would Junior Brother Li pull out a hammer?

"Ahem, it seems I need to bring out something from the bottom of my trunk," Ouyang said, taking a deep breath.

He rummaged inside the room for a while and soon returned with another scroll.

He unfurled the painting.

On it was a vividly lifelike strange beast, incredibly divine.

"I was fortunate enough to encounter a strange beast once. It carried a trace of the Bai Ze bloodline."

"I put in a great deal of effort to paint it on paper, creating an Upper-Shaped diagram. It was because of this that I broke through to a higher realm..."

"Senior Brother..."

"Hm?"

"I'm sorry, I accidentally sank my mind into it again just now..."

Ouyang was stunned and looked down.

The God-Viewing Diagram containing a trace of the Bai Ze bloodline met the same fate as the "Tiger Descending the Mountain" painting.

It was shattered into murky ink stains.

The paper, which originally carried a heavy artistic conception, now felt light and flimsy.

Ouyang sat down on the ground, as if his soul had left his body.

"My painting..."

"Senior Brother, how much was this painting worth?" Li Mo asked awkwardly.

*Wuu wuu...* "This was a work of my heart and soul. At the time, to track down that strange beast, I didn't sleep for ten days and nights."

"Ten thousand taels?" Li Mo took out a silver bill.

*Wuu wuu...* "I was even kicked by that strange beast, and a few of my ribs were broken."

"Twenty thousand?" Another silver bill was placed before his eyes.

"Junior Brother, this is a work of art. Do you know what art is? If it were sold to someone who doesn't understand..."

"Thirty thousand."

Li Mo said expressionlessly, taking out three more bills directly.

"Junior Brother, you clearly have the talent for art."

Ouyang's face changed like a Sichuan opera, revealing a smile.

In reality, the cost of this painting was only around ten thousand taels. If he found the right buyer, he could sell it for at most thirty to forty thousand taels.

Fifty thousand taels was already a huge profit.

Li Mo was a bit speechless, but he didn't lose out either.

**[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing 50,000 taels of silver in 'Ouyang'.]**
**[Investment Feedback: *The Record of the Magic Brush Producing Flowers and the Ink Wash*.]**
**[ *The Record of the Magic Brush Producing Flowers and the Ink Wash* ]: "A unique painting method that can replicate the essence, energy, and spirit of an object and imprint it onto paper."**

The reward looked pretty good.

But Li Mo was feeling a bit listless right now.

Why can't he even contemplate an Upper-Shaped diagram?

What should he do now?

Does he really have to paint it himself?
