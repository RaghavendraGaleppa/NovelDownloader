# Chapter 548: Exchanging for Secret Arts

Xu Yunfan looked at his attribute panel. The *Heaven-Earth Interplay Yin-Yang Separation and Union Sutra* was nearing minor completion, and though there was still a long way to go before major completion, it signified that he had truly stepped through the doorway.

Cultivating these True Sutras of the Dao was now far more difficult than in the Divine Martial Realm. Even though the proficiency required to go from minor to major completion was still only one thousand points, gaining a single point of proficiency now was exponentially harder than before.

At least a day's worth of training had to be stretched out over a month.

Xu Yunfan felt a bit helpless. Fortunately, his current cultivation base was deep enough; otherwise, cultivating the Yin-Yang Separation and Union Sutra would be no different than starting from scratch.

He carefully reviewed the information regarding the ancient sword "Sinking Star" and the legacy treasure of the Divine霄 True Lord from the ancient scroll.

It was a clue to a Spirit Treasure, likely at the level of a Golden Core True Lord.

Moreover, it was a Spirit Treasure that perfectly契合ed the True Art he cultivated. Xu Yunfan couldn't just let this go.

If this treasure truly existed, its value would be immeasurable.

The *Divine霄 Nine Palaces Mysterious Firmament Immortal Destruction True Sutra* possessed both supreme offense and defense, ranking among the top even within the Three Sects. If he could obtain the legacy treasure of the Divine霄 True Lord and pair it with his sutra, its power would be unimaginable.

Such a top-tier True Art, with its corresponding throne vacant, would naturally attract envy.

Xu Yunfan was well aware of this.

Ever since Chu Chengnan failed to prove his Dao and gain his throne, Xu Yunfan had gained a very clear understanding within the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm.

In this realm, whether it be fortuitous encounters or opportunities, most of them are bait cast out by scoundrels.

Just waiting for someone to take the hook.

In other places, it might be like Jiang Taigong fishing—waiting for the willing ones.

But the Realms and True Lords in this realm try every means to manipulate karma to achieve their own ends.

For several months, contrary to what Liu Yunhua and the Heavenly Calculation True Lord expected, Xu Yunfan digested all his gains, clearly perceived the growth in his own strength, and sorted out the clue to the Spirit Treasure.

Yet, he remained as steady as Mount Tai, as if nothing had happened. He sat cross-legged on the stone platform, his breath long and steady, showing no intention of leaving his peak.

He did not rush to follow the clue to find the so-called Spirit Treasure, did not immediately go to the Hundred Desires Peak for revenge, and did not even leave his cave dwelling to inquire about the outside world.

Xu Yunfan simply closed his eyes again, sinking his mind deep into his Dantian's Sea of Consciousness.

Thunder roared, and lightning flashed within his thoughts.

He practiced his arts.

He tempered his nascent Heaven and Earth, operated the *Divine霄 Nine Palaces True Sutra*, attempted to deduce the essence of the *Heaven-Earth Interplay Yin-Yang Separation and Union Sutra* he had just acquired, and silently accumulated power.

The shifting winds and clouds outside the mountain, the temptation of the heaven-shaking opportunity, seemed all to be blocked out by the thick restrictions and the endless thunder of the Divine霄.

Only by remaining unmoved can one be the origin of all movement.

Cultivation knew no seasons. Within the cave dwelling, the low rumble of divine thunder was like a drumbeat lasting for eternity.

Until this day, the thunder vortex that had almost condensed into a solid form on the figure sitting cross-legged in the center of the cave dwelling slowly calmed. The surging, vast aura around his body completely fused back into one, like a deep abyss hiding a mountain—solid and heavy.

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes. Silver lightning patterns flashed and vanished in the depths of his profound gaze.

*‘You focused on cultivating the Divine霄 Nine Palaces Mysterious Firmament Immortal Destruction True Sutra, gaining deeper insight into it. You comprehended its true meaning. Proficiency +3’*

*‘...’*

Nearly three years of seclusion had accumulated a total of fifty points of proficiency. Xu Yunfan was quite satisfied.

Daoist scriptures not only required understanding the mysteries of the True Art but also required comprehending the heavens and earth. This was especially true for the *Divine霄 Nine Palaces Mysterious Firmament Immortal Destruction True Sutra*. To invoke Divine霄 thunder, one needed a strong interaction with the heavens and earth, requiring careful comprehension of the cycle of life and death within the Divine霄 thunder.

The principles within the *Heaven-Earth Interplay Yin-Yang Separation and Union Sutra* also provided Xu Yunfan with great support in speed.

"Phew..."

He exhaled a long breath of turbid air, carrying faint arcs of lightning that dissipated before him.

He stretched his limbs, and his entire body immediately emitted a series of "crackling" sounds like frying beans. This was the sign of his bones and muscles resonating, and the thunder power within his flesh and blood flowing naturally.

"It's about time I went out for a walk."

It wasn't that he truly wanted to go for a walk, but rather that he still had two secret arts he hadn't had the chance to exchange for. As his Daoist cultivation grew deeper, his nascent Heaven and Earth had become completely stable.

Xu Yunfan estimated that even if a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator came, they wouldn't be able to do anything to him.

But who was stronger and who was weaker could only be known after a fight.

As the Peak Master of Divine霄 Peak, his first order of business was naturally to inspect his "estate."

His Divine Sense swept over every part of Divine霄 Peak. Whether it was the cultivated spirit fields, the tamed low-level thunder beasts, the various small-scale gathering thunder arrays and refined simple thunder talismans managed by the disciples, or the "industry" of refining Eight Scenery Cloud Qi from which he took a cut, everything was running in an orderly fashion.

The disciple in charge of specific administrative affairs had long since presented a clear and detailed account via jade slip upon receiving Xu Yunfan's notification.

Xu Yunfan glanced through it, and the smile on his face widened.

"These kids, they didn't slack off."

They were indeed all talents. There were quite a few hard workers within the Primordial Origin Sect.

After all, they were saddled with loans the moment they were admitted; they had to work hard.

If they were slightly lazy and the loan became overdue, the consequence would likely be them being "processed" as materials.

The profits were even more substantial than he had expected.

Although, with his current mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, these spirit stones and resources weren't exactly earth-shattering, they were a continuous, steady stream. They were enough to support his daily cultivation needs and contribute to the accumulation of his Eight Scenery Cloud Qi.

The thicker the foundation, the more comfortable things are.

With his business done, Xu Yunfan took out a scroll radiating a soft jade light. Daoist rhymes flowed upon it; it was the edict of the Clear Source True Lord.

He was going to the core hinterland of the Primordial Origin Sect.

The Scripture Pavilion.

Transforming into a brilliant rainbow, Xu Yunfan stepped out of Divine霄 Peak and flew straight towards the depths of the sect.

Along the way, whether outer sect disciples or inner sect elites, sensing the thunderous pressure emanating from him—even though he deliberately restrained it—stepped aside and bowed.

A Foundation Establishment True Realm was a pillar of strength within the Primordial Origin Sect, possessing great dignity.

The Primordial Origin Sect's Scripture Pavilion was not a magnificent hall, but a massive tower built from countless black boulders. The spire was hidden within the perpetually lingering dark gray clouds. The tower body was covered in writhing, twisted ancient demonic patterns and layers upon layers of protective restriction brilliance, exuding an ancient, profound, and mysterious aura.

The main entrance looked like a beast's maw ready to devour people. Above the lintel hung a black bone tablet full of cracks. On the tablet, the word "Zang" (Storage/Scripture) was written in blood-red paint, the strokes twisting like struggling living things.

Seeing this scene, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.

He wondered whose twisted sense of humor had decorated the Scripture Pavilion like this.

After thinking about it for a moment, it seemed the Blood Elder was currently on duty at the Scripture Pavilion.

This person cultivated a truly pure and authentic demonic art.

A mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator with a distorted mind, a very demonic style, and very villainous behavior.

He was a pure soul who shone and burned for the Primordial Origin Sect.

With such a decoration, it was understandable.
