**Chapter 116: Can Fight, Can Slay**

Chen Shuhang suddenly attacked, a palm-blade cutting through the air. Five-colored Thunderforce burst forth from his body, striking towards Qin Ming’s neck with truly ruthless intent.

Qin Ming felt the terrifying high temperature raging around him. A wisp of hair floating outside his helmet stood on end as the five-colored Thunderforce swept past, indistinguishable from real lightning. He had sensed it coming early and had been on guard, moving like the wind, shifting his body to evade. The five-colored Thunderforce narrowly missed him, roaring past with a tremendous sonic boom. Such power was enough to blast a giant elephant into a bloody pulp, scattering all the dense light mist nearby.

At the same time, Jiang Congyun’s fist arrived close, living up to the name of Pure Yang. As this Skyforce erupted, his fist seemed to hold a golden sun, blindingly bright. Its scorching heat could shatter one’s spirit and will, no wonder it made the outer-sect practitioners wary!

Qin Ming’s expression was cold. To avoid being caught in a pincer attack, he unleashed the Hegemon’s Force, sweeping across like wind scything through clouds, igniting the accumulated Outerworld Skyforce in the vicinity. The light mist in this area boiled, and the dense Outerworld Skyforce surged violently, enveloping the two who had suddenly launched a deadly assault on him.

In an instant, the three of them burst out, avoiding the Skyforce that raged like a stormy sea. They each took up a position, confronting each other silently.

Wealth stirred hearts, and even more so a near-immortal object. Qin Ming knew where the problem lay: that hazy near-immortal artifact was wreathed in auspicious light and immortal mist, accompanied by the rare phenomenon of a great medicine about to emerge.

He said in a deep voice, "After a thousand years, even if there was once an immortal medicine left behind, it would have long since rotted away. Do you dare to consume it?"

The two simultaneously attacked him, clearly having formed an alliance before entering the heavenly pit. Upon seeing what appeared to be an elixir near the legendary near-immortal artifact, the two exchanged a glance, instantly deciding to launch a joint sneak attack on him.

The bottom of the deep pit was uneven, crystallized from exposure to high temperatures. Dense Skyforce flowed, like colorful light mist burning fiercely. An ordinary newcomer taking a single breath here would have their lungs incinerated.

Chen Shuhang and Jiang Congyun exchanged a look. Since they had already made their move, they had no desire to explain anything now, as any words would seem pale and powerless. Both men’s expressions were calm, their eyes deep, as they approached Qin Ming from different directions.

"Brother, my apologies!" Chen Shuhang spoke.

"We’ll send you out!" Jiang Congyun’s voice was cold and emotionless.

Since they had already offended him, they naturally would not allow this person to study the near-immortal object with them. Regardless of whether there was a profound opportunity, they would first sever his chance of getting close.

Qin Ming’s voice was indifferent. "You are indeed ruthless. Regardless of whether your initial choice was justifiable, since you’ve made your move, you intend to see it through, correct?" He did not actively attack, even wanting to stall for time. He could survive at the bottom of the pit without the protection of Pure Yang blood, but the same could not be said for the other two.

Chen Shuhang and Jiang Congyun wasted no time. Having made their decision, they instantly launched their assault, charging at him together, both going all out. Regardless of whether the opponent was a Six Imperials Force successor, the fact that his fist-light could wound a Huangting realm outer-sect disciple indicated he was definitely someone significant and deserved serious attention.

Sharp beams of light shot from Qin Ming’s eyes, his anger soaring. The opponents had misjudged, mistakenly believing there was an immortal medicine, and had suddenly attacked him. Now they wanted to press on to the bitter end—this was truly going too far! Instantly, his body was covered in dense Skyforce, a sacred radiance enveloping him entirely.

"Is that all?!" Chen Shuhang was stunned.

"The Skyforce extends only two or three inches from his body?" Jiang Congyun also showed a very surprised expression. They had truly not expected that, after this so-called Six Imperials Force successor fully erupted, his Skyforce would be so weak, not even as long as their fingers. They didn't delay; in such an extremely dangerous pit, a swift battle was the safest approach.

Thunder exploded between Chen Shuhang’s five fingers. The five-colored Thunderforce belonged to the category of extraordinary arts, and now fully unleashed, it extended half a meter from his body. Jiang Congyun was even more overwhelmingly powerful, arriving mid-air. His feet seemed to step on a golden sun, his soles erupting with dazzling light as he stomped towards Qin Ming’s head. This Pure Yang Force was reputed to be indestructible, capable of instantly slaying Yin Spirits.

Qin Ming’s expression was icy, and this time he did not retreat. For opponents he didn't fully understand, he habitually gave them the highest "courtesy": going all out. Looking closely, one could see that the Skyforce on his body had eighteen different patterns, flowing with brilliant colors. Though not dense, it was exceptionally radiant.

Qin Ming’s fist, wrapped in threads, flowing with flames, and surging with golden light, collided with Chen Shuhang’s outwardly radiating five-colored Thunderforce. It actually penetrated the half-meter-thick Skyforce, piercing through the renowned Thunderforce! All newcomers knew that among all Skyforces, Thunderforce was undoubtedly one of the most masculine and potent. Yet now, Qin Ming had broken it with his bare hands. His Skyforce enveloped his fist, extending only two or three inches, negligible compared to his opponent's, yet it was devastating. With a bang, he seemed to be channeling divine lightning, crushing Chen Shuhang’s half-meter-long Thunderforce and then striking towards his hand.

Chen Shuhang’s pupils contracted. This was absurd. How could a Skyforce barely extending from the body contend with his? If Qin Ming were just an ordinary Outer Saint, it would be one thing. Chen Shuhang was quite famous, always striking down the strong with the weak, but today he was being counter-attacked! He retreated rapidly, worried he couldn't block that intimidating Skyforce. With a tearing sound, his palm was grazed, instantly bleeding, a deep wound torn open. That Skyforce was simply too overbearing; a slight brush nearly cost him a chunk of flesh.

At this moment, Jiang Congyun leaped over. Qin Ming merely tilted his head slightly, avoiding the airborne kick, and then struck outward with his arm against the leg. Jiang Congyun saw Chen Shuhang's reaction and knew he had met a tough opponent, a truly thorny one. All his Pure Yang Force surged into his leg, a dazzling light, and he was rapidly descending. At this moment, his entire leg seemed to be ablaze, raging flames. His Pure Yang Force had been pushed to its absolute limit. If an outer-sect practitioner’s spiritual light were here, it would surely be incinerated. Even a newcomer’s spiritual consciousness would be affected, leading to dizziness and a splitting headache.

Qin Ming felt nothing. He blocked with his arm, colliding with the Pure Yang Force renowned in the Night Mist World. Dazzling light and sparkling radiance burst between them. With a bang, Jiang Congyun was sent flying sideways, stumbling. He looked down to see the golden armor on his leg shattered, his Pure Yang Force broken by the opponent. Fortunately, it was a hurried collision, and his leg was not severely damaged, only slightly bruised with traces of blood seeping out.

What kind of monster was this? Both masters felt a tremor in their hearts, already understanding they had poked a hornet's nest. They possessed secret methods and had previously observed Qin Ming, assessing his physical condition, believing he was still within the normal range for an Outer Saint. Now, both realized the grave mistake they had made. This person was not yet an Outer Saint, but his vitality was already no weaker than someone in the second realm.

"You are a nine-times reborn prodigy?!" Their gazes at Qin Ming changed completely; they had actually encountered such a legendary figure. In normal circumstances, it was rare to encounter such prodigies. Everyone knew that ancient clans passed down for a thousand years were likely to have them, but they almost never showed their faces. Pure Yang Palace, as an ancient orthodox lineage famous in the Night Mist, was still a vibrant behemoth and naturally strove to find and cultivate such prodigies. Regardless, Pure Yang Palace would never release a prodigy to help outer-sect disciples compete for a near-immortal object.

"Is the Six Imperials lineage so 'luxurious'? They just casually release a prodigy who hasn’t even reached the second realm? Aren't they afraid of something going wrong?" Jiang Congyun found it incredible and incomprehensible. Chen Shuhang was also shocked. The Six Imperials lineage possessed an unfathomable depth of heritage. To be invited to assist in battle and actually "squander" a low-realm prodigy was simply outrageous.

"Has the gap between our Pure Yang Palace and the Six Imperials lineage widened to such an extent?" Jiang Congyun sighed.

All these thoughts flashed through their minds in an instant. Now, both sides were still in a tense standoff, and they couldn't truly let their guard down. Qin Ming ignored their words. He had thoroughly understood their capabilities. He could fight, and he could slay!

When he attacked again, his movements were fluid and natural, embodying the demeanor of a young grandmaster. He unleashed Wuji Fist, his entire body wreathed in earthy vital energy. As his fist collided with Jiang Congyun’s sun-like fist, his Yin Earth Force and Yang Earth Force interconverted, dissolving the Pure Yang Force into nothingness. With a bang, he sent Jiang Congyun flying.

With a whoosh, he activated the Hegemon’s Wind Force, moving like a raging tempest, instantly closing in on Chen Shuhang to meet his five-colored Thunderforce. Qin Ming’s fist, flowing with Wuji Force, shattered the opponent's five-colored Thunderforce, then transformed into Lihuo Force. This extraordinary art was unique, seemingly able to ignite the opponent's Skyforce, especially when Qin Ming struck the moment Chen Shuhang’s five-colored Thunderforce collapsed. The Lihuo Force surged, as if setting a prairie ablaze.

Chen Shuhang was greatly alarmed and quickly retreated, but he was ultimately struck by Qin Ming’s palm, sent flying horizontally, continuously coughing up blood. Qin Ming, wielding the Hegemon’s Wind Force, instantly appeared before Jiang Congyun, blocking his path, and engaged him in a fierce fistfight. This time, he switched to the Golden Silkworm Art, empowered by his fused Skyforce, making it even more potent than the original extraordinary art.

Jiang Congyun was shocked. His Pure Yang Force could not penetrate the dense golden threads covering the opponent’s fist; it was as if an immense net had blocked it all. Then, he grunted in pain, his fist bloody. The three-inch long golden threads projecting from Qin Ming’s fist had pierced through, severely damaging his flesh and finger bones.

"Golden Silkworm Art!" Jiang Congyun recognized that extraordinary art. He knew very well that it wasn't the Golden Silkworm Force that was stronger than his Pure Yang Force, but rather that the nine-times reborn prodigy was using the Six Imperials methods to fuse extraordinary arts, making him unbeatable.

In an instant, Qin Ming exchanged blows with him repeatedly, from the Golden Silkworm Art to the Lihuo Force, and then to the Wuji Fist, making the Pure Yang Palace successor cough up large mouthfuls of blood, his hands a mangled mess of flesh and blood, and his arms permeated by that terrifying Skyforce, with multiple bone fractures.

*Puff!*

Chen Shuhang, who was trying to flee, was intercepted by Qin Ming again. He was repeatedly hit by Yellow Mud Palm, Wuji Fist, and Lihuo Force, resulting in multiple bone fractures, with his shoulder blade even shattered. It was as if he himself had been struck by lightning, his body scorched, with numerous broken bones, severely injured, and his life force dimmed.

"I admit my mistake and accept punishment. Please be merciful. I am willing to exchange scripture for my life," Chen Shuhang pleaded, unable to endure anymore. He was young, still a teenager, and did not want to die here.

Qin Ming was moved. Those he defeated now would hardly pose a threat to him in the future. Moreover, did these two even know who he was? If they dared to retaliate, they should go find the Six Imperials successors.

"I am also willing to trade a cultivation method for my life," Jiang Congyun quickly added when he saw Qin Ming stop.

"If the five-colored Thunderforce is leaked, not only will I die, but my clan will also be implicated," Chen Shuhang said, preferring death over betraying his sect's fundamental art.

Qin Ming tried to obtain the five-colored Thunderforce through mental resonance, but ninety percent of what he got was the opponent's fear. He shook his head, reluctantly giving up. Ultimately, he obtained a type of electric force from Chen Shuhang, and through mental resonance, he confirmed that this cultivation method was authentic. Although he didn’t get the Pure Yang Force from Jiang Congyun, to his surprise, the cultivation method he did receive was also extraordinary, named "Minor Yang Art." For rogue cultivators or those from minor sects, this was already an extremely rare manual.

"You may leave," Qin Ming said, keeping his promise and letting them go.

The two felt immense bitterness. If only they had known, why had they bothered in the first place? One wrong move, and they had lost completely.

"Is the Six Imperials lineage going to emulate the Tathagata, preparing to raise Gu-worms and plant cicadas, releasing all their potential disciples into the world?"

The two did not dare to delay, dragging their heavily injured bodies, and quickly ran outside. Their Pure Yang vital essence had been depleted in the battle, and even though they tried to absorb Skyforce, much of it was still shaken loose from them.

...

Qin Ming came alone to the center, where he saw the near-immortal object. It flowed with immortal light, radiating auspicious energy, enveloped in white mist, and imbued with an ancient,沧桑 (ancient and vicissitudinous) aura. "What a good thing!" he exclaimed. There were indeed other items here, bringing a look of joy to his face. "This near-immortal object is an ancient artifact. It must have come into contact with many important figures. I wonder if there are any lingering emotions, and if I can achieve mental resonance?" Qin Ming's eyes burned with eagerness; he wanted to try.
