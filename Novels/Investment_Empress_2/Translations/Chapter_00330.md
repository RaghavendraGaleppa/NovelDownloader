# Chapter 330: A Taste of Sweetness (1/2)

The faint crackling of charcoal in the copper basin dispelled the chill outside the tent.

Ying Bing sat quietly by Li Mo’s bedside, legs crossed, her gaze lowered as she looked at the words only she could see.

[South疆 Prodigy Rank #50: Zhu Ningze]
[South疆 Prodigy Rank #49: Qiu Lianyu]
[South疆 Prodigy Rank #48: Hei Yu]
...

The South疆 was much larger than the East Wasteland, but the portion inhabited by humans was even smaller.

The surname Hei?

This seemed to be a branch of the Great Shang royal family. Their totem was the evil turtle Li Mo had smashed. By that logic, this tribe had participated in the attack on Green Wood City.

Many of the names above were similar.

Those remnants of the Great Shang were still active deep within the South疆, influencing the land with their beliefs.

Ying Bing’s expression remained unchanged as she memorized each name and the tribes behind the surnames.

[South疆 Prodigy Rank #10: Zhong Ling.]
[South疆 Prodigy Rank #9: Huang Donglai.]
...

[South疆 Prodigy Rank #4: Zhong Zhenyue.]
[South疆 Prodigy Rank #3: Shang Qi]
[South疆 Prodigy Rank #2: Shang Yusun]
[South疆 Prodigy Rank #1...]

She looked at the last line of text from the system.

Ying Bing.

She finally saw her name at the very top of the ranking. This was the number one spot she had long yearned for.

Yet, she found she wasn’t as happy as she had expected. Perhaps because she didn’t see that familiar name, these fifty names felt empty, as if something were missing?

[Congratulations, Host! You have achieved first place in the system ranking for the first time!]

The annoying system deliberately enlarged the text this time, adding special effects to the characters.

[After the system upgrade, a First Place Special Effect Celebration function has been added. Would you like to fire a salute for the birth of the champion?]

"No need."

Ying Bing tied her hair back again, inserting a jade hairpin.

[But the Host didn't have to complete a system punishment this time. Isn't this a cause for celebration?]

A cause for celebration...?

The punishment was gone.

"But I promised to give him a gift."

"The champion of the Supreme Prodigy List should not go back on their word."

Ying Bing stood up.

The Empress of the Phoenix, the Master of the桂 Palace—how could she speak without keeping her promises?

But he hadn't woken up yet...

The system was announcing the reward for first place, but she was lost in thought, not even hearing what the reward was.

She couldn't help but recall a story Li Mo had casually told after a meal.

A sleeping princess was awakened by a prince's kiss.

At the time, she thought the story was far too childish. But now she wondered, if it followed the development of a children's story, would it be...

Ying Bing glanced at Little Li, who was still sleeping peacefully. She walked to the copper charcoal stove and began decocting the second portion of medicine.

A while later.

Li Mo woke up.

He first smelled the bitter medicinal scent and couldn't help but frown.

When he opened his eyes, he froze.

Not far from the charcoal fire, a figure otherworldly and pure was tending to the stove, watching the heat of the medicine. With a fan in her slender hand, she gently fanned the flames, letting them lick the bottom of the pot.

The firelight softened her jade-like features, making her radiant beauty impossible to look away from.

"Ice Cube..."

Li Mo looked at the Cold Immortal, feeling a warmth in his heart.

"You're awake? Perfect."

Ying Bing gently poured out the medicine and walked closer:

"The medicine is ready. Drink it while it's hot."

"!"

Little Li's expression was complex.

Waking up to see the Ice Cube brewing medicine for him was indeed heartwarming.

But this was the Ice Cube's medicinal soup.

Made 'personally' by her.

---

Li Mo still couldn't forget that stir-fry with chili and meat.

Ying Bing lowered her face, the color of the stove's firelight still seeming to linger in her eyes:

"Li Mo, be good."

"I'll drink it!"

Li Mo thought to himself that he had a divine body, immune to all poisons. What was a mere Ice Cube soup?

He tried to raise his hand to grab the medicine and down it in one go.

But he found his arms were numb, completely unresponsive. It must be a side effect of sustaining World Power for too long.

Fortunately, the Ice Cube's spoon was already brought to his lips.

"Is it too hot?" Ying Bing asked.

"No, but..."

Li Mo's expression was like a tortured Piggy Hero, wanting to speak but holding back.

It wasn't just bitter.

What exactly was in this medicine? It tasted sharp and sour...

"Really? This medicine shouldn't..."

Ying Bing frowned and tasted a bit herself. It was visible that she shuddered slightly.

She was silent for a moment, then said:

"Good medicine tastes bitter. You'll recover faster if you drink it."

"It's fine if I recover a bit slower... *cough cough*!"

Under the Ice Cube's gaze, Li Mo chose to pinch his nose and take two more sips.

But the medicine was just too bitter.

After only two sips, he couldn't help but cough.

"Ice Cube, do you have anything sweet? I may not have achieved a great feat, but the labor was indeed bitter. I should at least get a taste of sweetness."

"Taste of sweetness..."

Ying Bing bit her lip.

Thinking for a moment, she put down the medicine and took out that piece of candy from the big-headed doll.

Li Mo was thinking that putting the candy in the medicine might slightly improve the sharp sourness of the soup...

Then he saw the candy go between the Ice Cube's lips.

"?"

Li Mo froze.

Wasn't she supposed to give him a taste of sweetness?

But the next second, a faint fragrance reached his nose. She leaned in closer, and he could see the soft light catching her eyelashes.

The look in her eyes grew more intense, the color of the firelight becoming more distinct.

Little Li suddenly understood the words in her eyes:

"Sweetness. Eat."

In the eyes of the world, what kind of person was Ying Bing? Cold, holy, mysterious. Just the title "Cold Immortal" showed how unattainable she was.

But now, with candy between her lips, she was right there.

She didn't say a word.

But when her eyes looked at you, it felt heart-stopping, and you could no longer pay attention to anything else in the world.

How could that be a gaze?

It was an arrow piercing the heart!

Little Li had never understood before how there could be beauties in the world capable of toppling cities and kingdoms, bringing disaster to the country. The so-called "beautiful woman is a disaster" was just shifting the blame onto women.

Now he wanted to say, "King Zhou, I understand you."

So this was the gift the Ice Cube spoke of...

"I'll eat it."

"En..."

The gentleman Li Mo leaned in, but found the candy moving away.

He leaned in again...

It moved away again.

"?"

He looked up and saw the color in her eyes trembling slightly.

The candy between her lips had melted a bit, a thin layer of syrup glistening.

"Ice Cube, you..."

Li Mo opened his mouth with a serious expression.

But as soon as his mouth opened, a slender hand grabbed his chin.

The wind and snow outside the tent seemed to grow heavier.

Would the Tiger and his grandfather still come out to set up their stall recently?

No wonder there is an idiom called "sweet as candy"...
