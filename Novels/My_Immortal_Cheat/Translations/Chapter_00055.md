# Chapter 55: Live Confrontation!

All eyes in the VIP rooms turned towards it, their gazes filled with profound meaning as countless divine abilities and secret techniques were deployed.

“No spiritual energy fluctuations? How is that possible?!”

The Duke’s sharp eyes, like swords, pierced through the void, seeing everything clearly.

A single thought emerged in everyone’s minds:

“Zhou Tian is somewhat different!”

“Look, there’s someone over there!”

Someone reminded those beside them, and more and more people turned their gaze towards Zhou Tian.

The arena was a self-contained space, naturally equipped with spatial barriers. But against Zhou Tian’s [Teleportation] skill, these were mere trifles!

Without the slightest hesitation, Zhou Tian directly passed through the spatial barriers outside the arena and entered its interior. At this moment, Uncle Zhou was slowly controlling a purple orb of light, gently lowering it to the ground. Inside the orb was Tian Ling.

“Young Master!” Uncle Zhou bowed slightly.

“Mm.” Zhou Tian nodded, teleporting to Tian Ling’s side as the purple runic shield vanished.

Zhou Tian quickly supported Tian Ling, who was about to fall. Blood seeped from Tian Ling’s lips, her face as pale as gold leaf. She looked up at Zhou Tian, speaking with difficulty: “Zhou Tian…”

“Don’t speak…” Zhou Tian pulled out a golden pill he had been holding in his palm. Runic patterns swirled around it, emitting a fragrant aroma. This was something he had requested from Zhou Xunchuan just as he arrived. “Eat it…”

Tian Ling’s dark brows lowered. She glanced at the pill Zhou Tian held to her lips, then parted her cherry-red lips, revealing glistening teeth, and swallowed the medicine.

The pill melted instantly upon entering her mouth. Tian Ling’s body glowed, and streams of divine radiance surged within her, repairing her injuries. Tian Ling closed her eyes in Zhou Tian’s embrace, recovering from her wounds.

“Uncle Zhou, let’s begin,” Zhou Tian said, looking at Uncle Zhou beside him.

“Yes, Young Master.” Uncle Zhou nodded, waving his hand. A rune shot out, landing before Zhou Tian’s mouth, forming a hidden runic array.

“Alright, Young Master. Whatever you say now can be heard by everyone, including those watching the projection,” Uncle Zhou said.

Zhou Tian nodded, took a deep breath, and said: “Distinguished audience members present, and people of Futian Province watching this match through the projection, first and foremost, I must apologize for affecting your viewing experience!”

“Good… good… He knows how to lower his posture and apologize first to win people over. This boy is much better than that brute Zhou Yi.” Prime Minister Liu nodded, smiling.

“Some of you may know me, and some may not. Let me first introduce myself: I am Zhou Tian, the Third Prince of the Qin King of Tianqin. Of course, most of you probably know me as the mortal with blocked meridians,” Zhou Tian said with a self-deprecating laugh.

Across Futian Province, more and more people gathered beneath the projection screens to witness this major 'melon' – a big scandal or juicy piece of gossip – that hadn’t appeared in many years. Hearing Zhou Tian’s words, many people chuckled. Indeed, the topic of 'the famous Qin King’s son being a mortal unable to cultivate' used to be their common after-dinner conversation!

“This is my fiancée, Tian Ling. You all know about His Majesty’s imperial decree bestowing this marriage from a while ago. As you all just witnessed, on the surface, Tian Ling faced deadly danger, and then my people broke the rules to rescue her. But in reality, that is not the case at all!” Zhou Tian said gravely. “If it were a normal match, I would never interfere. But some individuals harbored malicious intentions, aiming to retaliate against me by killing my fiancée. Furthermore, they bewitched and exploited my Tianqin citizens, using a forbidden technique pre-set on a Saint Artifact to interfere with the match, which resulted in that contestant losing their life!”

In the Great Luo Academy’s room, everyone frowned. How could Zhou Tian be spouting such nonsense, making such wild accusations? Who wanted to kill his fiancée? What kind of place was this? Even if they wanted to, they couldn't do it here. They knew he would surely interfere with the match, but they only wanted to make him lose face.

“Isn’t this Zhou Tian a mortal? How is he so different from the rumors?!” Tie Niu frowned and said.

“Tianqin possesses countless foundations, so this isn't surprising. But why does he dare to say this in front of the entire Futian Province? Can he really control the outcome?” Zi Qing felt a flicker of unease in her heart, her eyes like a clear jade pond.

People across Futian Province debated amongst themselves. Zhou Tian’s words were very clever; he brought in the common people of Futian Province, making most of them instantly connect with the matter and feel a sense of involvement.

“I know it’s hard to convince everyone with just my words. So, next, I invite those people to come forward for a confrontation!” Zhou Tian gestured to Uncle Zhou, who stood beside him. Uncle Zhou waved his hand, and profound fluctuations spread. A spatial通道 was opened, and the Great Luo Academy members, who had been in their VIP room moments before, now appeared on the arena.

The Great Luo Academy members felt the spatial shift, their expressions all incredibly grim. Being directly dragged onto the arena was a blatant disregard for them!

“Everyone, isn’t the scene before you quite different from what you expected?” Zhou Tian asked the Great Luo Academy members with a smile.

“Young Master Zhou, what is the meaning of this? Are you looking down on my Great Luo Academy?” Scholar Li cursed those people internally, but ultimately, they were still students of the Great Luo Academy, and he couldn't let anything happen to them here. He asked with a somber face.

“Scholar Li, the Great Luo Academy has always been a sacred institution in my heart, always respected. But it seems your Great Luo Academy doesn't hold me in any regard.” Zhou Tian’s brazenness was astonishing. “Those few behind you have been constantly making petty moves in my Tianqin Empire, bewitching my Tianqin citizens to turn against me, and even caused a promising citizen to die because of your schemes!”

Zhou Tian was filled with righteous indignation, speaking with awe-inspiring integrity, standing on the side of the common people to denounce the other party!

“Young Master Zhou, is there some misunderstanding here? Our academy’s students have always been self-disciplined and principled; they would not do such things. Do not believe the instigating words of petty individuals and ruin the friendship between our two families for no reason!” Zi Qing took two steps forward and spoke gently, implicitly warning him not to spout baseless accusations without proof, and that any so-called witnesses would be dismissed as petty individuals whose testimony would not be acknowledged.

Zhou Tian understood perfectly, but he still feigned ignorance. He took out a rhomboid jade slip from his clothes and handed it to Uncle Zhou, who injected energy into it, causing a projection to unfold…

“They…”
“…heavy bribes…”
“…murder…”

Scene after scene flashed by, all showing individuals the Great Luo Academy had contacted. With them and their families and friends captured, they naturally held nothing back, revealing everything.
