Chapter 202: Number One and Number Two

Within Feixian Academy, the lake shimmered, and clusters of weeping willows along the banks looked like wisps of green smoke.

Although the area was bustling with many famous disciples, Qin Ming and Little Wu suspected that they might not be able to "team up" with anyone.

Little Wu squeezed through the crowd, approaching a dazzling girl surrounded by people. "Divine Maiden Jiang," he said, "I've finally found you."

The bright girl, named Jiang Ruoli, came from Bodhi Academy, which had a Tantric background. She was quite famous, and this group seemed to be led by her. She looked surprised. "Excuse me, are you...?"

Little Wu immediately flashed a brilliant smile. "Me? Wu Yaozu, one of the best fighters on this year's freshman path! My brother and I would like to join your team."

In an instant, Jiang Ruoli realized this wasn't an acquaintance, but someone volunteering their services, hoping to follow them into the Secret Realm.

She smiled faintly. "I'm sorry, Brother Wu, but our team is already full. You might want to look elsewhere."

"Alright then, Bodhi Number Two." Wu Yaozu didn't dally. He turned and left, immediately heading to the next group.

"What does that mean?" Jiang Ruoli and those around her were puzzled.

Then, they saw Little Wu squeeze into the Sky Roc Dao Field group, his face once again beaming. "Senior Brother Gan Jincheng, I've long admired your name. I've been looking for you for a while..."

Soon, he was rejected again, and he muttered, "Goodbye, Sky Roc Number One!"

"Fairy Lin Qianyi, so pure and ethereal, truly the cream of our generation! I've been waiting for you for a long time..." Little Wu then approached the genius disciples from Eclosion Dao Field.

Lin Qianyi, dressed in silver armor, looked suspicious. She didn't know this person. After realizing his intent, she politely declined as well.

"Alright, Eclosion Number Two, goodbye." Little Wu turned and left.

Jiang Ruoli and the others gradually understood. This guy was incredibly enthusiastic when greeting people, using titles like Divine Maiden, Senior Brother, or Fairy. But once rejected, he'd drop the name, changing "Senior Brother" to "Number One" and "Fairy" or "Divine Maiden" to "Number Two," with a prefix indicating their academy or dao field.

"That's truly... realistic."

"Huh, Bodhi Number Two is observing me. Did she change her mind?" Little Wu whispered to Qin Ming, noticing Jiang Ruoli looking their way.

Jiang Ruoli's expression stiffened. Her hearing was exceptionally sharp, and she had indeed guessed correctly; she had already been downgraded from Divine Maiden Jiang to Bodhi Number Two.

"Lower your voice," Qin Ming reminded him.

The main issue was that there were over a dozen famous academies and dao fields here, with no shortage of genius disciples. After being rejected, Little Wu wasn't in the mood to meticulously remember all their names.

"Senior Brother Wang Lijie, as graceful as jade..."

"Alright, Dragon Elephant Number One!"

Gradually, some people noticed these two youths hitting walls everywhere, with no team wanting them, and they realized they were assigning nicknames.

"Your two friends are hitting walls everywhere," Zhao Muyao, in snow-white robes, chuckled, glancing at Ling Yu.

No sooner had she spoken than the main characters themselves approached. Little Wu was unaware that this woman from Pure Yang Academy had already politely declined Ling Yu's recommendation.

"Fairy Zhao, your beauty is peerless..." Little Wu said with a face full of sincerity, first praising her, then expressing his desire to join her team.

"I'm sorry, we don't need any more people," Zhao Muyao gently shook her head.

"Goodbye, Pure Yang Number Two!" Little Wu left without a moment's hesitation, turning his back before she could finish speaking.

Zhao Muyao was stunned, her expression frozen!

Soon after, Xiao Yaqin from Calamity Aversion Dao Field, a very famous disciple, was also given the title "Calamity Aversion Number Two" by Little Wu.

"Xin Youdao, what's wrong with your friends?" Xiao Yaqin asked.

"Ah, I was distracted. I didn't hear anything."

...

Qin Ming felt that Little Wu had truly "graduated." In his current state, he didn't need anyone to lead him; he was attacking everywhere without a hint of embarrassment.

However, the two of them still found it difficult to find people to team up with.

Not long after, they spotted a special freshman. The moment he walked over, he drew everyone's attention because he was so unique: hands like palm-leaf fans, a face as big as a basin, and legs as thick as pillars.

Qin Ming recognized him; it was Xiang Yiwu, the Buddha's Discarded Disciple, whom he had met at the Luofu Immortal Mountain ruins.

Xiang Yiwu's unique physique made it impossible to conceal his identity. He was wider than two ordinary people, and his thick, coarse black hair was as stiff as steel needles.

In short order, some teams began vying for him, having learned his identity. This was an absolute top master among his peers.

Little Wu was indignant. Why was the gap between people so vast? The two of them were ignored, and even when they eagerly tried to join, they were rejected.

Now, a hulking brute like this was actually so popular!

"He's one of us!" Qin Ming secretly informed him.

"Oh, never mind then."

However, the Buddha's Discarded Disciple couldn't stay there.

An elder walked over and led him away, saying that he wasn't a disciple of the Kunling academies and needed to be sent to the Tantric sects and places beyond the world. He was to go with that group, entering from a different entrance.

There were others like him, such as Lu Zhen from Yinyang Temple, who could contend with Tang Xumi at Luofu Mountain and helped Li Qingxu almost seize the Near-Immortal item. He had also come but was quickly invited away.

Qin Ming was surprised. Were the formidable figures from this freshman path about to emerge one after another?

Subsequently, he had to face a harsh reality: he and Little Wu hadn't been able to join any team so far. Whether it was the famous geniuses from the previous batch or the new disciples of this batch, no one wanted to take them.

This was because these teams had already privately settled their members in advance.

Even Liu Hanhya, a celebrity from Mountain River Academy, didn't choose them.

"Senior Sister, you're one of us!" Little Wu exclaimed.

"But my team is indeed full," Liu Hanhya said, looking troubled.

At this point, Mountain River Number Two was also born.

After understanding what it meant, Liu Hanhya glared at the two of them.

Qin Ming and Little Wu learned that this Secret Realm was worth exploring, with many good things to be found within.

Someone with well-informed sources revealed a hidden detail. "It's said that this time we're not entering the old Secret Realm from before, but a newly acquired territory, part of the secret realm on the plateau ruled by the auspicious beasts we mentioned earlier!"

Currently, the elders were already in the initial stages of clearing that plateau.

Qin Ming and Little Wu couldn't help but sigh. Freshmen had it too rough. To be hired or team up, one needed pre-existing connections. Now, humble nobodies like themselves, arriving on-site and hoping to join on the fly, had no way out!

Finally, after some deliberation, the two decided they had to find a way to form their own team.

"Senior, I'm cultivating dual paths, and I'm also someone on the Immortal Path. I can establish my own team!" Little Wu told an elder.

He used the rainbow light within his body to form spiritual consciousness, and the middle-aged man didn't notice anything unusual, mainly because it was impossible for the young man in front of him to be displaying the techniques of the freshman path.

Thus, under the gaze of the teams led by the "Number Ones" and "Number Twos" from various academies, a two-person team, the smallest and most "rudimentary" in number, was formed.

With his youthful spirit, Little Wu declared, "Everyone, if you encounter demons, ghosts, or any dangers, or if there's fierce competition and you need our help again, I estimate you won't be able to afford our price then!"

Apart from Xin Youdao and Ling Yu, everyone else laughed.

"Wang Lijie of Dragon Elephant Dao Field, I look forward to the two junior brothers' astonishing performance in the Secret Realm!"

"Lin Qianyi of Eclosion Dao Field, may the two junior brothers shine brightly in all directions. I'll be watching."

Some couldn't help but tease, feeling that the two youths were being too presumptuous. How dare a two-person team speak like that?

Jiang Ruoli, Gan Jincheng, Su Junlin, and others also chuckled softly, discussing amongst themselves.

"Your friends aren't reliable!" Zhao Muyao, in her snow-white robes, said to Ling Yu.

Ling Yu really wanted to retort that they were very reliable. If he hadn't been warned, he would have wanted to team up with them directly.

Xiao Yaqin looked at Xin Youdao, shaking her head slightly. "I feel like these two friends of yours are going to make a fool of themselves in the Secret Realm."

"I think what they said isn't an exaggeration," Xin Youdao sighed, feeling quite regretful that he couldn't join them.

Little Wu grumbled, "Even Liu Hanhya from the same Mountain River Academy is laughing at us. That's going too far."

Qin Ming was distracted, not paying attention to any of that.

He thought of his acquaintances. He wondered if he would see Li Qingyue in the Secret Realm, and if his old friend Ning Siqi, who had entered the Tantric sect, had come?

As for the faces of Li Qingxu, Wang Caiwei, Cui Chong, and others, they also flashed through his mind.

"Tang Xumi, Hu Tingwen, you still owe me a Divine Ape Strength Technique!"

Immediately, Qin Ming's expression turned serious. If everyone entered the same Secret Realm, the competitive pressure would be immense. He wondered how it would be arranged.

After all, he had encountered seven people on the Vermilion Bird, including Su Shiyun and Zhao Yaoting, all of whom were Near-Immortal Seeds or Divine Seeds, each more powerful than the last.

Wu Yaozu nudged his arm. "Brother, didn't you hear me? These people are laughing at us."

"I was distracted," Qin Ming smiled. "What's this? We'll see who's truly capable later. Since we have a team, we should go back."

"With your perpetually single status, why are you spacing out? Are there people you know who are also entering that Secret Realm?"

"If you can't speak properly, then shut up."

Over the next few days, Qin Ming not only practiced the *Dragon Serpent Scripture* but also began to study the *Immortal Butterfly Scripture*, continuously comprehending its essence.

Clearly, Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan's claim that they wouldn't "feed" him, fearing he'd become useless, wasn't entirely true; otherwise, they wouldn't have directly given him a second wondrous technique.

Moreover, their arrangement for him to enter the Secret Realm this time was also a way of arranging opportunities for him.

Five days later, Qin Ming and Little Wu set off. They were still at the neighboring Feixian Academy, where they met a large group of teams led by "Number Ones" and "Number Twos."

Everyone boarded a giant flying ship, bound for the Secret Realm on the plateau.

Immediately, Qin Ming felt a chill down his spine. He had fallen from a bird, landed in the divine city of a giant centipede, and also fallen from a ship. Although he had miraculously survived unharmed each time, he genuinely had a psychological shadow.

A few hundred miles was not far. They traveled by flying ship and arrived at their destination, landing on the plateau.

Qin Ming breathed a sigh of relief. Thankfully, there was no "crash" this time!

"This is the Secret Realm?" Many were astonished, finding it incredible.

Ahead, a particular area was very unusual. There were no tall trees or thick vines; it seemed covered in a layer of moss, strangely out of place with its surroundings.

"Watch closely," the elder who brought them here said. He suddenly stepped forward.

Many were shocked to see him shrink rapidly, becoming as tiny as a sesame seed, as he entered the special area ahead.

It looked like a small patch of land, yet it possessed such miraculous power.

Many people knelt down and gazed intently, even able to see the elder's minuscule figure, no bigger than an ant.

"This is the Secret Realm?"

"Do you know how it was formed?" The elder walked out, returning to his original size.

He explained that it was a fragment of a star, possessing extraordinary properties and unique energy. Standing on it was like stepping onto a star.

Subsequently, everyone lined up, stepped forward from the same spot, and soon stood on the star, observing the scenery on this celestial body, feeling quite awestruck.
