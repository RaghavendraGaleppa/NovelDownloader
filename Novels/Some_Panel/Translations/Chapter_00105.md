# Chapter 104: Mysterious Immortal Realm, Hundred-Thousand-Year Adamant Wood

“That old geezer woke up really fast,” the Buddha Child’s eyelids twitched, and he quickly urged, “Master, hurry, he’s catching up.”

“May the heavens strike you down, you dared to kill my son!” Behind them, a streak of emerald light tore through the sky, rapidly closing in. The terrifying killing intent caused hair-thin cracks to appear in the space wherever he passed.

The fury of a Void Refinement Realm cultivator was truly horrifying. Such individuals, involving the Great Dao, were already beings of another level, absolutely not something Yang Ji could contend with at present, not even for a single move.

Feeling the terrifying killing intent behind him, Yang Ji frantically activated his Sword Wings. At this moment, the Sword Wings were not spread out like actual wings, but rather folded together like flying swords, positioned along both sides of his back. They glowed with flowing light, and sharp golden sword qi spewed out from their tips like rockets, instantly covering a dozen li, truly reaching the extreme of speed.

Two streaks of flowing light, one in front and one behind, were separated by no more than five hundred li. Both exuded heaven-shaking might, emitting piercing, heart-stopping shrieks.

“Brat, die for me!” From behind, Liu Huang forcefully extended his five fingers and fiercely clawed at the sky ahead. The power of heaven and earth surged forth, pressing down. The surrounding space rippled like water, and the space in front of Yang Ji was instantly sealed.

However, a flash of his black and white dual swords, and the Returning Hidden Sword Style was unleashed. A sword qi containing the myriad phenomena of heaven and earth, pure and unparalleled, burst forth, instantly tearing through the spatial seal.

“Haha, that old geezer is only at the early stage of Void Refinement. His internal world isn’t fully perfected, so the world power he can mobilize is limited. He wants to seal space within a five hundred li radius? Dream on!”

“If he were to seal space within a fifty li radius, even a peak Spirit Transformation cultivator couldn’t escape. But five hundred li is too wide; once the sealing force is dispersed, while it can block ninety-nine percent of first-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, it can’t stop your sword, Master!”

Seeing Yang Ji display such divine might, the Buddha Child couldn’t help but let out a long breath, shouting with excitement and thrill.

“How is this possible? This brat is only at the first stage of Nascent Soul, yet he tore through my spatial seal?” Liu Huang was both shocked and enraged, his face burning with fury. His internal world resonated with the outer Great World, and he immediately mobilized a large amount of world power for spatial teleportation. Each jump covered dozens of li, several times faster than a Nascent Soul cultivator’s instant movement relying on the momentum of heaven and earth.

In just a few jumps, he closed the distance with Yang Ji. At this moment, they were no more than a hundred li apart. But just as he was about to unleash another spatial seal, he saw the person in front of him suddenly plunge into a massive gray wall.

Liu Huang, with his heart full of murderous intent focused solely on the person before him, had not noticed the rolling gray mist ahead. Only when he clearly saw it did his expression drastically change.

“Death Fog!!”

“This brat actually rushed into the Death Fog, damn it! What a pity he didn’t die by my hand!” Liu Huang’s eyes were as dark as water, his heart still surging with boundless killing intent.

The Buddha Child, seeing Liu Huang’s ugly expression as he remained outside, immediately taunted, “Old geezer, come on, come over here!”

“Seeking death! Gloomy Black Death Seal!” Liu Huang roared in anger. Dao energy circulated in his hand as he raised his palm and struck out towards the Death Fog. A colossal palm print, as tall as the sky and emanating a chilling demonic aura, plunged into it.

Boom!

The Gloomy Black Death Seal forcefully broke through, causing the Death Fog to roll back in layers to both sides. But it only penetrated about three li before the energy contained within the Gloomy Black Death Seal was completely depleted and dissipated by the endless layers of death energy.

Witnessing this, Liu Huang’s gaze narrowed. He knew the potency of the Death Fog. After delivering the palm strike, he looked inside. However, the figure he hated to the bone had long since vanished, whether dead beneath the palm print or lost within the mist.

However, one thing he was certain of: anyone who entered the fog would surely die. Yet, he remained unwilling, flying along the edge of the Death Fog, hoping to find Yang Ji’s corpse and shatter it into ten thousand pieces.

Yang Ji naturally sensed his accompanying flight. After a brief thought, he turned and flew deeper into the mist. Firstly, to avoid Liu Huang and prevent being discovered, which might cause unnecessary trouble later. Secondly, he was also curious: what exactly was inside this Death Fog?

As thoughts turned in his mind, he fully activated his Heavenly Cycle Teleportation, constantly dodging the death energy as he ventured deeper inside. One li, two li, three li… a hundred li.

The deeper he went, the brighter the light became. At a hundred li, it had suddenly become clear and bright. There was no gray mist, no death energy; before his eyes lay a hidden paradise, a land of immortals. This Death Fog actually concealed an immortal realm!

Here, mountain ranges stood tall, beautiful trees were lush, vines intertwined, spiritual qi permeated the air, birds sang and flowers bloomed, and flowing waterfalls adorned the landscape. It was a rare treasure land, a delight to Yang Ji’s eyes.

“Holy crap, where is this? Outside is shrouded in death, how can there be such a tranquil place inside?” The Buddha Child jumped out of his sleeve, looking around curiously.

Yang Ji glanced at him and immediately flew with him towards this immortal realm. The moment they landed, they were attracted by the sight of straight, towering trees, each several dozen people’s arm spans wide.

“Is this hundred-thousand-year Adamant Wood?” Yang Ji’s pupils slightly dilated, and his breathing quickened by three points. He focused his gaze again, confirming it.

[Adamant Wood, hundred thousand years.]
[Adamant Wood, one hundred eighty thousand years.]
[Adamant Wood, one hundred twenty thousand years.]
[Adamant Wood, one hundred fifty thousand years.]

“The minimum is hundred thousand years! My heavens, what kind of secret realm is this?” Yang Ji was deeply moved.

Adamant Wood, due to its special fragrance and incredibly hard and sturdy texture, was an excellent material for building palaces and was often cultivated. Senior Fu Dongliu’s residence beneath the undersea waterfall was built from thousand-year Adamant Wood. Thousand-year Adamant Wood was already considered a top-grade material in the outside world, capable of crafting top-grade magic artifacts. Ten-thousand-year Adamant Wood was even rarer, sufficient for crafting low-grade spirit artifacts. Although limited by the material’s inherent properties, Adamant Wood couldn't be used to craft treasure artifacts, this hundred-thousand-year Adamant Wood was definitely capable of crafting top-grade spirit artifacts!

Such a vast expanse, how many top-grade spirit artifacts could be crafted? "I’m rich!" These three words suddenly floated through his mind.

While excited, Yang Ji couldn’t help but become even more cautious. In such an unknown place, he dared not be careless. He quickly flew into the sky, looking around. After confirming that there was no danger within a five-li radius, he then plunged back down.

“Wow, such rich wood essence! This whole forest, I could eat it all and then run a lap!” Shen Yin, perhaps drawn by the scent, actually jumped out of the Mountain Sea Pearl. Her chubby face was full of surprise. With a flash of green light, she pounced on a nearby Adamant Tree and began gnawing on it.

“Master, who is she?” The Buddha Child was startled and asked in surprise.

“How did Little Shen Yin get out?” Yang Ji frowned slightly, reaching out to grab Shen Yin back. But his fingers flexed, then he lowered his hand. Since the Buddha Child had already seen her, after a brief thought, he decided not to deliberately make them avoid each other anymore. He looked at the Buddha Child and said, “Her name is Shen Yin, she’s the Realm Spirit of the Mountain Sea Pearl, and she particularly loves to eat plant essence.”

“Oh, so it’s Sister Shen Yin,” the Buddha Child nodded thoughtfully. “Then was it also Sister Shen Yin who ate the mountain last time?”

“Yes,” Yang Ji nodded. “Go, transplant all these Adamant Woods into the Mountain Sea World. We should improve the landscape inside the Mountain Sea World as well.”

“Alright, Master.” The Buddha Child grinned, then grew hundreds of feet tall, uprooting the Adamant Wood trees and displaying boundless divine bravery. Yang Ji remained suspended in mid-air, continuously observing his surroundings, daring not to be careless in the slightest.
