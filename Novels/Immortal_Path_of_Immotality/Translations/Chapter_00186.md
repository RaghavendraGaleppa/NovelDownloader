# Chapter 184: The End as the Beginning

"Guardian, how much longer can our eastern front hold?"

"About ten days."

"We can't wait that long—we have at most two days. The righteous factions have already secretly assembled a special task force composed entirely of high-level cultivators. They've quietly bypassed all our defensive lines and are heading straight for the eastern headquarters. If we don't leave now, we might not get another chance!"

"How do you know the righteous factions are planning a surprise attack on headquarters?"

Yan Yuanchun looked at Lin Shan with suspicion. In her mind, this kid was a blank slate whose greatest backer was herself. Where would he get such intelligence? How could he be so certain about the war situation?

Lin Shan hesitated briefly. He couldn't very well sell out his sworn brother Lin Fan. He vaguely mentioned receiving news from an old friend in the Song Dynasty's interior, who had fortuitously learned of this information and warned him in advance.

Seeing Lin Shan's earnest and serious demeanor, and trusting him implicitly, Guardian Yan could no longer sit still. She paced around the courtyard, deep in thought, before finally making up her mind.

"I'll go report this urgent military intelligence to Elder Discipline Dharma King immediately. I'll say I stumbled upon the information—this has nothing to do with you."

Lin Shan sighed in relief. As long as it didn't cause trouble for Lin Fan later, he was fine with it. It all depended on whether Guardian Yan could persuade the Discipline Dharma King. If the Black Lotus Sect still insisted on staying to await their doom, Lin Shan might have no choice but to slip away first.

After all, he had only joined the Black Lotus Sect a little over a decade ago. He hadn't been raised and trained here since childhood and felt no unbreakable attachment. His initial reason for joining was simply to find shelter under a large tree. All the resources he'd gained had been earned through his own efforts—exchanging merit points for contributions on the battlefield. He owed the Black Lotus Sect no debts of gratitude and could leave without a second thought.

...

By nightfall, Guardian Yan returned. Lin Shan and Luan Chun, waiting in the courtyard, hurried to greet her, eager to hear the outcome.

Yan Yuanchun's expression was grave and urgent as she spoke rapidly, cutting straight to the point.

"Elder Discipline Dharma King has verified the authenticity of the intelligence regarding the righteous factions' surprise attack on our eastern headquarters through unknown means. He has secretly ordered all Golden Core guardians to select their elites and begin preparations to evacuate tonight."

"This evacuation is to remain confidential. Since most members must stay behind as decoys, each Golden Core guardian is permitted to take no more than a hundred people with them."

"You two must quickly gather your trusted subordinates and leave the volcanic island headquarters. Head north to Silver Bee Island—meet me there by the hour of the Ox tonight without fail!"

...

Lin Shan and Luan Chun were stunned by this news. During the day, the Black Lotus Sect had still been locked in heated debates in the assembly hall. Yet by nightfall, they were already ordering high-level cultivators to lead an escape, cutting their losses—the decision had been made with shocking speed!

They couldn't help but marvel at the Discipline Dharma King's decisiveness. As expected of an old monster who had cultivated to the Nascent Soul stage, he could abandon tens of thousands of disciples in the eastern sea without hesitation.

Those tens of thousands of Black Lotus Sect disciples would likely remain oblivious until their deaths, waiting for the leadership to lead them to safety, never realizing they had been discarded as sacrificial pawns to mislead the enemy.

...

After leaving Guardian Yan's residence, Lin Shan and Luan Chun went their separate ways to gather their trusted followers.

Given the urgency, Lin Shan didn't seek out his subordinates individually. Instead, he returned to his cave dwelling and sent out a batch of messenger talismans, summoning them to gather in his courtyard.

His subordinates were quick to respond, arriving one after another in no time.

They found Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord in the courtyard, packing up the herb garden. The Black Skeleton Demon Lord had planted some small curiosities here, and now that they were leaving, everything had to be taken along.

These underlings were all sharp-witted. Seeing this scene, how could they not realize their boss was preparing to flee?

Their minds immediately raced. In these chaotic times, small players lived precarious lives, and their only thought was to cling tightly to their leader for survival.

"Boss, you've made up your mind?"

"Just say the word, and we'll follow you to the ends of the earth!"

"When are we fleeing to the outer seas? What are the higher-ups' arrangements?"

"We've been ready for ages—take us with you, sir!"

...

The group clamored around Lin Shan, all urging him to leave quickly. Having once been rogue cultivators from the eastern sea, their instinct to bend with the wind was ingrained in their bones.

Previously, the only reason they hadn't scattered like startled birds was fear that the demonic path's disciplinary squads would hunt them down and execute them as deserters. Now that Lin Shan had returned as their pillar of support, they naturally wanted to stick close.

"Careful with your words," Lin Shan cautioned, glancing warily outside. He ordered his subordinates to keep quiet—this was a secret retreat, after all. If word got out and caused unrest, with all demonic cultivators learning that the leadership was fleeing in advance, internal chaos would surely erupt.

If everyone fled, who would draw the enemy's fire? Who would serve as cannon fodder against the righteous alliance? Who would buy time for those in the know?

As the saying went: Better others die than oneself.

Lin Shan dared not disrupt the Discipline Dharma King's plans. The elder was preserving the sect's elite while sacrificing the expendable—a move that also offered Lin Shan a way out. He couldn't afford to mess this up.

But what were his subordinates thinking? Fleeing to the outer seas? Didn't they know those waters were dominated by foreign races and demonic beasts? Survival would be difficult enough, let alone ever returning.

Wouldn't it be better to head for the demonic path's main stronghold in the Lu Kingdom? There, they might find broader horizons.

As for staying behind—Lin Shan dismissed the thought immediately. His affiliation with the demonic path was well-documented, with records in multiple sects. Once the righteous alliance liberated the eastern sea, he would undoubtedly face retribution.

The Dry Cloud Pavilion, in particular, harbored a deep hatred for him.

"Go back and pack your belongings quietly, then return here immediately. Tonight at the hour of the Ox, I'll lead you on a secret mission..."

His sharp-witted underlings immediately grasped the implications, especially after seeing the scene in the courtyard. They scattered excitedly to prepare.

...

The hour of the Ox, Silver Bee Island, north of the temporary eastern headquarters.

The night was dark and windy, with turbulent waves crashing onto the shore. From the depths of the sea came the low moans of marine beasts.

Lin Shan stood behind Guardian Yan, surrounded by over a hundred people. As they watched streaks of qi silently cut through the night sky—large magical vessels carrying the demonic path's elites northward in retreat—a sense of melancholy settled over them, like the sun setting in the west.

The three demonic sects had traveled millions of miles across more than a dozen nations, returning to their homeland with lofty ambitions. After over a decade of bitter warfare, they had ultimately met defeat and were now withdrawing in disgrace.

The intricate details of their campaign, seemingly straightforward on the surface, were in truth shrouded in mystery.

A thousand years of meticulous preparation had brought them full circle.

And Lin Shan, caught once more in the tide of great events, would embark on a new journey.
