# Chapter 50: Two or Three

"Take this. It's a rare artifact completely free of any demonic cultivation aura. However, it requires three different types of True Essence simultaneously to activate. Keep it on your chest, and should you encounter danger in the future, you won't suffer severe injuries."

Ma Yun placed a round wooden plaque with a cord into Ding Rui's hand. Embedded in the plaque were two crystals of different colors, one yellow and one green, clearly representing Earth and Wood attributes respectively. Ding Rui genuinely wanted to accept it, but felt it was too much of a favor and tried to refuse. Yet, he couldn't. Ma Yun and Ma Tu were too enthusiastic, and Ma Wen on the side also kept urging him to accept. In the end, Ding Rui could only accept it. He indeed found the item very useful. Though it looked just like a wooden plaque, according to Ma Tu, it was a defensive spirit artifact stripped from the chest of a demonic cultivator.

Today's journey had truly brought him immense gains. He now had a certain understanding of the entire Huaqing Realm and this world of cultivation, no longer completely clueless as before. This was entirely thanks to the patient guidance and explanations of the two powerful cultivators, Ma Yun and Ma Tu. His gratitude and respect for Ma Yun and Ma Tu were heartfelt! Ma Yun and Ma Tu exchanged smiles, not feeling they had made any special contribution. Ma Yun even praised with a sigh, "Cultivators as interested in everything as you, young friend Ding Rui, are truly rare. Perhaps it's precisely because you desire to understand the characteristics of all these things that you're able to create such useful inventions!"

"If that's the case, then we've actually contributed to the sect!" Ma Wen suddenly interjected. "Who knows, after learning all this, Brother Ding Rui might go back and create even more amazing things!" Ma Yun and Ma Tu immediately laughed and nodded in agreement. Ding Rui, however, felt a little embarrassed. What creativity did he possess? The saddles and stirrups were merely recycled knowledge from his previous life, and his claim of liking research was entirely fabricated. After his laugh, Ma Tu's expression became serious. He looked at the sky and said, "It's getting late. We need to deliver these blueprints to the artifact halls of several sects. Young friend Ding Rui, you should head back first. Let Ma Wen escort you." Ma Wen immediately sprang forward.

Ding Rui watched with exclamations of wonder. However, due to the limited time, he ultimately didn't get to fully understand the art of artifact refining before being sent back. Afterward, he also asked the cultivators in the surrounding spirit fields, and even went to inquire with Liu Yun, but clearly, these people knew very little about artifact refining. Liu Yun didn't even have time to talk to Ding Rui. Having only recently become a spirit farmer, he was overwhelmed with work. Upon hearing Ding Rui's questions, he quickly ushered Ding Rui out, unwilling to waste any time. With the popularization of combat saddles and stirrups, saddles and stirrups for transportation were also fully promoted. The ponies within the sect's domain only needed to carry people, so the materials for their equipment didn't need to be too high quality; good enough was sufficient. Of course, Ding Rui also offered many suggestions for these two pieces of transportation equipment, leading to significant improvements.
