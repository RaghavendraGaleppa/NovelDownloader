Chapter 258: Jade Maiden’s Close Friend, Flower Cage Reappears, Affections Confused, Yin-Yang Secret Pact

The firewood shed was narrow, built of yellow mud and crushed stones, with a door but no windows. Fearing that the two people he had taken in might suffocate and die, the farmer left the door open when he departed, allowing moonlight to slant inside.

It shone upon Wen Caishang’s white boots.

The two had cast off their shells like cicadas, changing their clothes entirely. Only the boots had miraculously "survived." The white boots were of exceptional quality, with exquisite embroidery, unsoiled by dust or dirt.

The farmer in these wild mountains stored firewood year-round. Along the way, he picked up broken branches and leaves to fill the shed.

Accumulated over time, the pile was quite substantial.

It concealed the figures of the two.

Wen Caishang’s beautiful eyes held a killing intent as she sat atop Li Xian, a soft sword glinting with cold light in her sleeve. Her posture and demeanor made it seem as if she were afraid Li Xian would run away.

Li Xian was inwardly lamenting his fate. They had been hiding from pursuit all along. He had tried his best to conceal his "Heavy Pupil," knowing that this matter was difficult to explain. But Zhao Zhiyuan’s calamity was too fierce; there was no hiding it. Wen Caishang was quick-witted. In the depths of the perilous mountains, strange insects attacked constantly, making it hard to focus. Once they came out, she was bound to ask.

Wen Caishang said softly, "Li Lang, please explain yourself properly..."

Li Xian said, "Madam... regarding this Heavy Pupil..." Wen Caishang’s fingers gently caressed the sword wound on Li Xian’s chest, filled with affection and pity, yet also great resentment. She had never fallen for anyone in her life. She was the only one who loved Li Xian dearly. The more she thought of him, the more he stirred her heart, letting her taste the滋味 of love. Yet this boy lied incessantly, completely beyond her control. She said, "Don’t lie to me. I hate being lied to the most."

Li Xian said, "Madam... the Heavy Pupil appeared after my Perfect Physique awakened again. I hid it and didn’t say anything, all because... all because..." He was very good at arguing, but Wen Caishang was not easily fooled. At this moment, he was at a loss for words.

Wen Caishang said, "All because... you were afraid of me?" Li Xian nodded. Wen Caishang said softly, "Then were many things you said before, all lies?"

Li Xian thought: "Madam has escaped danger and is suspicious of me. If I tell the truth, it will only make her more suspicious. She likes to hear sweet words, so I’ll say more of them." He said, "No, how could I be willing to lie to Madam? Only regarding the Heavy Pupil, I was afraid Madam would be estranged because of it, so... so I hid it."

Wen Caishang’s body softened as she leaned against his chest and said, "Then... is what you just said true or false?"

Li Xian said, "Absolutely true. Could it be... that the dangers we faced along the way aren’t enough to prove my sincerity? If I were lying to you, why would I risk my life to protect you?"

"Or is it..."

"Madam treats me with nothing but schemes. Could it be... that you still can’t see my true heart?"

Wen Caishang panicked, "No... Li Lang... don’t think that way. I... I treat you with sincerity too. I’ve seen your true heart. I... I will treat you well. Let’s both be good to each other." She was ruthless and selfish. In the face of life and death, when had she ever said a soft word? But at this moment, the words slipped out.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang were both stunned. Li Xian said, "Madam, let’s sleep now." Wen Caishang nodded, somewhat unwilling, but could only drop the subject.

Silence reigned throughout the night.

The next day.

Before the rooster crowed, Li Xian and Wen Caishang left hand in hand. With money in their pockets, they felt confident. They walked into the city to see the lively scene.

They saw a flow of people like a woven tapestry, bustling commerce, and endless carriages and horses. The scent of daily life filled the air. Having lived in the mountains and forests for a long time, seeing this scene again, they felt an indescribable sense of warmth.

Li Xian was very happy. He found a clothing shop and spent several taels of silver to buy new clothes for both of them.

Li Xian was clean and bright, dressed simply and plainly. But his natural, unrestrained charm was hard to hide. He combed his long hair and tied it up simply with a bamboo hairpin.

Wen Caishang spotted a jade crown. She gently picked it up, turned it over, and examined it. She said, "Xiao Xian, you are eighteen now; it is time to wear a crown. Come here, I will help you put it on."

The etiquette varied by dynasty. In the Nanyang period, men wore crowns at fifteen. In the Great Yu dynasty, they wore crowns at eighteen. The Great Wu dynasty followed the customs of Great Yu, wearing crowns at eighteen, though some waited until twenty.

By the calendar, Li Xian had reached the age of crowning. He could take a wife and start a family. Li Xian removed the bamboo hairpin, letting his long hair fall loose. Wen Caishang’s fair hands moved gracefully, gathering the long hair and pinning the crown in place as she stood on tiptoe.

After this grooming, Wen Caishang was deeply moved. With his hair neatly tied, Li Xian’s face was completely uncovered. His brows were lofty and heroic, exuding a vibrant spirit while retaining a deep, reserved demeanor.

A handsome young master.

"Good man, good man..." Wen Caishang was delighted, gently caressing his face. The two were intimate, completely disregarding the people around them.

This clothing shop was of a decent scale; those changing clothes were mostly wealthy. Young ladies from distinguished families, wives of officials, famous courtesans... often frequented the place. They couldn’t help but stare. Seeing Li Xian tall and handsome, they were captivated, staring in shock.

Wen Caishang frowned slightly and said calmly, "Ladies, is my young man good-looking?"

The women snapped back to reality. Seeing that Wen Caishang’s appearance was also extraordinary, they all withdrew their gazes. Wen Caishang frowned slightly. The two had practiced their dual-sword technique along the way, with deep affection accumulated. The more she looked, the more she liked him.

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "Commonplace women, why bother with them. Xiao Xian, I’ll help you pick a set of clothes. I guarantee it will make you look exceptionally handsome. Come with me..."

Li Xian stroked his crown and said, "Madam... it might be too ostentatious." Wen Caishang said, "Young man, are you unwilling to accompany me?" Li Xian said, "I can only risk my life to accompany Madam then."

Wen Caishang selected several sets of ready-made clothes. The prices were all extremely high. Li Xian looked at his money pouch and quietly reminded her. Wen Caishang was secretly annoyed, her interest ruined.

She had to settle for something simpler.

Wen Caishang’s beauty was stunning; simple skirts and luxurious robes alike couldn’t hide her attractiveness.

But the more expensive the clothing, the more it accentuated her beauty, making her attire more exquisite. Li Xian paid for the clothes, thinking: "This beauty is truly expensive to maintain. With my limited wealth, I can’t even buy a decent set of clothes properly."

They looked completely refreshed. Wen Caishang walked with graceful, unhurried steps. Although the quality of the clothes was slightly inferior, when she wore them, she exuded an air of elegance and nobility.

The shopkeeper wanted to keep Wen Caishang and Li Xian to paint their portraits and post them outside the shop to attract customers.

This kind of business was quite common. Li Xian wanted to avoid trouble. Although Su Qiuwu and the others were trapped in Tiger Cry Ridge, he still needed to keep a low profile. So he flatly refused.

After changing clothes, it was time to eat. Li Xian’s culinary skills were excellent; he could turn wild ingredients into unique dishes.

But it was never as good as the delicacies of a restaurant, which better reflected the local flavors. The "Drunken Spring Pavilion" had famous dishes, and outside, women played the pipa.

The melodies were sweet and pleasant, and the patrons were all elegant scholars. Li Xian and Wen Caishang had an extraordinary aura and dressed appropriately. The shopkeeper didn’t dare to neglect them and arranged a private seat, serving fine dishes one after another.

Wen Caishang said softly, "Li Lang, now that we have escaped danger, Caishang must thank you properly!" She took the initiative to pour tea and offer wine.

They clinked glasses, forgetting the conversation of the previous night. The shopkeeper served the dishes, and they tasted them one by one, enjoying a unique sense of elegance and pleasure.

After eating and drinking their fill. For safety’s sake, Li Xian hurried to the city’s bustling market to check the "Red List" for wanted notices. There was no longer "Heart-Eating Lord Li Renshan" or "Blood-Drinking Poisonous Woman Wen Snake Scorpion."

It turned out...

The Divine Catcher Leng Shixing knew the dangers of Tiger Cry Ridge well. He figured that if the two fled into the mountains, they would likely never return. So he reported to the Patrol Sky Department that the criminals had been executed and had the wanted notices removed.

Moreover... Li Xian and Wen Caishang had crossed hundreds of miles, leaving the Tiger Cry Ridge mountain range. They had already left "Flower Water Prefecture" and arrived at "Heavy Ridge Prefecture."

They were very far away, and the Red List notices hadn’t spread here yet. The vast sea of people served as a natural barrier. Even if the Sword Hunting Alliance had immense capabilities, it would be difficult to track them down.

Li Xian smiled with relief, stretching his arms. He said, "With this move! We have finally escaped completely." Wen Caishang said, "Yes."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Madam, you always say you want to thank me properly. How do you plan to do it?" Wen Caishang said, "Brat, are you trying to be clever? I will thank you, just watch."

The rest of the journey was long, but no longer dangerous.

Li Xian felt carefree and took Wen Caishang on a tour of mountains and rivers, having a great time. After about three or five days, they arrived at the county city of Nanwang County in Heavy Ridge Prefecture.

Wen Caishang introduced the history of the county city. Three thousand years ago, a plague raged in this city, extremely fierce. The Nanwang County greatly invited physicians to prepare medicine. They controlled the plague and avoided the disaster of the city’s destruction.

Hence, the city was named "Nanwang City."

She also spoke of the history of the Nanwang. When she mentioned that the Nanwang was naturally romantic and had a crowd of wives and concubines, she suddenly said coldly, "Although the Nanwang had many achievements, he was inconstant in love, which was not good at all. Xiao Xian, you must not learn from him."

Nanwang County City was preparing for the Lantern Festival.

It was extremely lively. Scholars and literati came in groups to view the lanterns and observe the local customs.

Li Xian, with memories of two lifetimes, remembered that Qingning County also had a similar grand scene, called "Gathering." At that time, the streets were crowded and very lively. When he was young, he used to go to the market with his father. He loved buying sugar-coated fruit skewers... each skewer had five sour and fragrant fruits.

He ate two, and his younger brother ate three. When the two brothers were "dividing the loot," they saw the wealthy children in the county. One person could eat a whole skewer and could also change the flavors. If they got tired of the sweetness, they would give them to the servants to eat.

Even the servants ate better than the two brothers.

Li Xian thought of the past. Things were different now, and he couldn’t help but shake his head and smile. He bought two skewers for five copper coins. One for the Madam and one for him. As he ate, he talked about the past.

His voice was gentle. The past events were ordinary, but when he spoke of them, they were captivating, soothing the heart.

Wandering through the lively street scene had a unique charm. Appreciating the lantern flowers, watching acrobatics, watching the iron flower dance, watching operas... they experienced them one by one. Qingning County didn’t have such liveliness. Although Li Xian had been to many big cities, he had only passed through them in a hurry.

Now that they had escaped a great disaster, their state of mind was different. What they enjoyed, felt, and saw was naturally different. Wen Caishang was the same. In her life, she had never traveled with a man.

Lantern festivals, lively festivals... all kinds of folk festivals, she had no interest in them at all. She had never wandered around like this. Traveling with Li Xian in the bustling market was very novel and joyful.

The historical books of ancient and modern times are full of great events. Such small details and liveliness have no qualification to be recorded in history books. The charm within them is uniquely attractive.

That night, after enjoying themselves to the fullest, the two entered the forest. The dual swords joined forces, expressing their deep affection. Wen Caishang’s sword quality was soft, but her sword momentum was like a hot wave, entangling like thoughts. Each sword stroke wanted to bind Li Xian tightly.

Li Xian’s sword momentum was bright and unrestrained, always carrying a surging desire to see a thousand miles and look over the world. As they practiced the sword, they felt the difference between them more and more.

Wen Caishang expressed her affection but always felt an indescribable frustration. It was like scratching an itch through a shoe.

But the dual-sword union and the exchange of affection, although not entirely to her satisfaction, were still enjoyable. The first layer had been practiced hundreds of times, so they moved on to the second layer.

Bathing together in sweet dew, sharing life and death, piercing each other’s chests, the setting sun and the defeated moon... various sword moves were executed one by one. Wen Caishang had already perfected the second layer and had been practicing the third layer for some time. When they danced the second layer together, her sword Dao attainment was deeper, so she took "Yin" as the main and "Yang" as the auxiliary.

Her sword momentum was continuous and lingering, pulling and entangling Li Xian. When practicing the second layer, she was visibly joyful and even more carefree. After a round of sword dancing, she said, "Li Lang, the first layer has nothing left to practice. From now on... let’s practice the second layer exclusively!"

Li Xian smiled and said, "Good!"

At this time, holding Wen Caishang, she was sweating fragrantly, moved by emotion. Li Xian’s romantic nature was such that as long as he took the initiative slightly, the grand Madam of the Broken Sword Manor would surely fall.

Li Xian’s future was uncertain, and he didn’t dare to take that final step. Wen Caishang thought to herself: "This brat has endless tricks; he is definitely not truly honest. But why is he acting like a block of wood now? Could it be... could it be that I punished him too harshly? When he used to have delusions about me, I would stab him with my sword. He... he became afraid because of that?"

She suddenly felt immense regret. Everything she did was to control Li Xian, to hold his emotions and fears in her hands. She treated Li Xian as her own property, to use as she pleased. But at this moment, she could no longer treat Li Xian as an "object." How could she bear to use him? Yet the desire for control remained undiminished, even stronger.

The two returned hand in hand. They bathed together, changed clothes, and slept in the same bed. Li Xian guarded his heart firmly and did not act recklessly.

Wen Caishang wanted to speak but hesitated, her beautiful eyes filled with reproach.

The next day.

Li Xian wasn’t in a hurry to travel. The Lantern Festival in Nanwang City was exceptionally lively, so he took his wife to tour it and stayed for a few more days.

That day, they passed by the Nanwang Mansion.

They saw the gates wide open. On the stone walls on both sides were posted notices that read: "There is a banquet inside. Heroes of the Jianghu are all welcome to take a seat."

Li Xian stopped to look. Wen Caishang said, "This is a banquet to recruit talent. It’s fine to蹭 some food."

Li Xian asked curiously, "Madam also likes to join the fun?" Wen Caishang rolled her eyes and poked Li Xian’s chest with her finger. She said, "How could I be willing to join the fun? I know you love to join the fun. And I’m afraid of causing trouble."

"There is indeed trouble at this talent recruitment banquet, but if we just eat and leave, we won’t get involved. To stand in the Jianghu, if one doesn’t even have this kind of magnanimity, one wouldn’t dare to host a banquet."

Wen Caishang was very clear about the ways of the Jianghu. Li Xian was open-minded and easygoing, so he walked freely into the mansion.

The steward, wearing a brocade robe, had a strong presence and considerable strength. He said, "Two heroes, the banquet is this way, please take a seat." He pointed to a fork in the path.

The path extended, with finely trimmed plants and vines hanging as decorations on both sides. But after walking a hundred zhang, it became increasingly quiet, with more and more wild branches, as if it had been abandoned for a long time.

At the end of the path, a huge stone blocked the way. On both sides were dense thickets.

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "If you want to蹭 food, you need some real talent. This is a test set by the Nanwang Mansion."

The boulder was extremely heavy. A strong martial artist could barely move it. The surrounding thickets obscured the view. Wen Caishang said, "Xiao Xian, we don’t need to think too much. Just move the boulder, and the path will appear."

The intention was very clear: "Those skilled in strength, move the stone." "Those skilled in wisdom, enter the thicket." Li Xian placed his hand on the boulder, tapped the ground with his toes, and lightly lifted the boulder. He carried it several zhang away.

Wen Caishang clapped her hands and said, "Good! Great strength!" Martial artists are not known for brute force. Therefore... a high-level martial artist’s strength may not be very great.

Wen Caishang could sever a boat with a single sword, easily and effortlessly. However, lifting and carrying a boulder was definitely not her strong suit. But she had the ability to grind the boulder into dust.

The realm is the soil; what kind of flower blooms and what kind of fruit grows depends on the martial artist’s own learning and practice.

Wen Caishang suddenly said with a grievance, "Heavy Pupil, truly formidable." Li Xian said, "Madam, I’m sorry, I won’t hide anything from you anymore."

Wen Caishang said, "If you hide things from me, what can I do about it? Hmph." Li Xian said, "I... if I hide things from you, may I be crippled and live a life of unrest."

Wen Caishang suddenly froze. Her thoughts were in a mess. She said softly, "Xiao Xian, let’s go, let’s go to the banquet."

The path was now revealed. The two walked a short distance and saw an open lawn. There were more than ten eight-immortal tables set up, with about thirty percent of the seats occupied.

Each table had people. They were all Jianghu knights and heroes, with outstanding looks and demeanor. They drank tea and wine, chatting calmly.

As soon as Li Xian and Wen Caishang appeared, everyone’s eyes were drawn to them. Li Xian cupped his hands and nodded, signaling friendliness to everyone. Wen Caishang kept her hands in her sleeves, too lazy to pay attention.

Li Xian chose a table with fewer people and sat down. He saw a stream flowing on the grass and birds singing clearly, creating an indescribable elegance.

A knight at the same table smiled and said, "Young friend is very handsome. Where are you from? Who is this lady beside you..."

Li Xian smiled and said, "From the poor heavens, this is my wife." The knight said, "Good... a wife is good..." He was very disappointed.

Wen Caishang felt a slight joy in her heart and acted gracefully. She poured tea and water for Li Xian. The knight slightly pushed his cup, wanting the beauty to pour tea for him too.

Li Xian, without changing his expression, lightly tapped the teapot over, placing it steadily in front of the knight. Li Xian said, "If you are thirsty, brother, please pour it yourself. My wife has a bad temper and can’t serve others."

The knight smiled awkwardly and poured his own drink. Wen Caishang thought: "This brat’s intention to protect me hasn’t changed." Her heart softened.

The sound of the pipa echoed melodically, and fragrant mist drifted from all directions. Seven graceful maidservants, wearing colorful flowing sand dresses that couldn’t fully cover their skin, brought dishes to the table.

The banquet began. The first dish was a specialty of Heavy Ridge Prefecture, "Sour Vinegar Phoenix Eggs." It was sour and fragrant, appetizing and aromatic.

The ingredients selected were naturally not "Phoenix Eggs." It was actually local chicken eggs, prepared through a complex and intricate process.

Li Xian tasted it. Wen Caishang said, "Although this dish is an appetizer, the way to taste it is also particular."

She poured tea, slightly filling the bottom of the cup. Then she poured the specialty "Oil Sauce" of Heavy Ridge Prefecture and said, "Drink this first, then taste the Phoenix Egg."

Li Xian secretly sighed: "If I could truly have Madam serve and accompany me like this, it would be a great blessing. If Madam weren’t so ruthless, this tender乡 would truly break the bones of heroes."

He followed her instructions and tasted it; the flavor was infinite.

Wen Caishang picked up a handkerchief and gently wiped his mouth. She said seductively, "Li Lang, how is it?" Li Xian said, "Delicious beyond compare."

Subsequently, several more dishes were served. Wen Caishang served Li Xian food and drink one by one. She was elegant, noble, gentle, and thoughtful. The people around looked on with envy.

Fine food and wine were all served. The master of the mansion, "Ma Xuan," walked into the center of the field with large strides.

He cupped his hands in apology, his words不失 grace: "Thank you all for gracing us with your presence. My humble abode is honored. I suddenly had urgent matters to attend to and couldn’t toast you all immediately. I am truly sorry. I, Ma, will punish myself with three cups."

He drank three cups in a row, very heroic.

The other knights said one after another, "Master Ma is the host, treating us with great care. The wine and food are all top-notch. How could we blame you?"

"Indeed, Master Ma is too polite. Come... let us all toast to Master Ma."

Li Xian followed the crowd and toasted from a distance.

Wen Caishang whispered in his ear, "Hosting a talent recruitment banquet must mean that this mansion has some trivial matters that are difficult to handle and need people to take care of. In such cases... this Ma Xuan will likely host two banquets. One in the inner courtyard, for those who received invitations, famous and named figures. One in the outer courtyard, for Jianghu wanderers. If there are powerful figures among the wanderers, they will be invited to the inner courtyard for detailed discussions."

"He speaks nicely, but in reality, he doesn’t care much about the guests here. But such people, even if they stab you in the back, won’t let their smiles drop."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Fortunately, I have Madam with me. Otherwise, I would surely be deceived by these old foxes."

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "You’ve seen the dangers outside. It’s not really fun."

Li Xian smiled without speaking. Wen Caishang said, "Most of the guests here don’t know the key points. They are grateful and feel indebted because they ate his food. Later, Master Ma will surely recount his grievances. These people, swept up in righteous indignation, will boast and promise to help solve the problem."

"That’s how... they are all used as pawns. The Jianghu is vast, and there are too many such foolish people. We are not in a hurry, so let’s listen to the excitement. When the time comes..."

Li Xian smiled and said, "When the time comes, we’ll just slap our butts and leave." As he spoke, he made a move, but it wasn’t on his own butt.

Wen Caishang scolded with a嗔, "Bad boy." She was嗔喜不已.

Ma Xuan’s face was filled with sorrow. He hesitated and said, "Please drink well, everyone. Sigh... it’s rare for heroes to gather today. If not... if not for that matter... sigh! I really wish I could drink heartily with all you heroes."

A knight below asked, "Master Ma, do you have some difficulty? Please tell us. We’ve eaten your food and wine. If it’s within our power, we might be able to help."

Ma Xuan said, "This... this... how can that be? I, Ma, invited you all solely to see the heroes’ spirit. Seeing you heroes enter my mansion and drink freely makes me indescribably happy. To mention my own trivial matters would be to spoil the fun."

"Brother Ma, you are too stubborn!" A knight said, "We’ve drunk your wine and eaten your banquet; we are already friends. If you consider us friends, please speak plainly! Hmph, otherwise... I won’t drink this wine!"

Li Xian understood: "Ma Xuan is recruiting capable people to use. These knights are主动 to help, wanting to make connections and increase their reputation."

The Nanwang Mansion has a good reputation. So it was very easy to get a response. Li Xian thought: "Profit can tempt people, fame can drive people. Fame and profit combined, raising a hand and shouting, the response is endless! There are always people rushing forward to help deal with troubles."

Ma Xuan then poured out everything. It turned out... a few days ago, a niece of a distant relative came to visit with her close friend.

The two had played in Nanwang County for several days, but yesterday they suddenly disappeared. They suspected they had been captured by the Flower Cage Sect.

Ma Xuan said, "If you all have the ability, please help. My niece is pampered and can’t stand any grievance. And... and the woman accompanying her."

"Her background is naturally not bad; she is from the Dao Xuan Mountain. She is very familiar with the Jade Maiden of Dao Xuan Mountain. If you lend a hand, you might get to know the Jade Maiden Zhao Ranran."

Li Xian muttered: "Zhao Ranran?"

"I stumbled into a marriage contract. This Zhao Ranran is a descendant of the Zhao family. Now I’ve heard her name again."

The knights were impassioned and determined to help. Although Li Xian hated the Flower Cage Sect for its evil deeds and fear of chaos under heaven, he thought he was alone and his abilities were limited, so it would be hard to make a difference. So he left with Wen Caishang.

Ma Xuan of the Nanwang Mansion was slightly displeased but didn’t say much and saw them off politely. About seventy percent of the knights in the hall stayed, and thirty percent left.

They played for two days and took a boat to leave Nanwang County. They traveled south, enjoying themselves freely along the way.

They got closer and closer to Qiong Tian Prefecture.

That day.

In a desolate and remote wilderness. Li Xian and Wen Caishang once again joined their swords. The second layer of sword moves was executed naturally. Wen Caishang’s soft entanglement was endless, wanting to rot the hero’s bones and soften the man’s heart.

Li Xian’s whole body trembled. The second layer of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword, successfully stepped into the "Perfection" realm. From passive to active, from Yin as main and Yang as auxiliary to Yang as main and Yin as auxiliary.

The sword momentum changed instantly. The scorching sun hung in the sky, open and unrestrained, shining over mountains and rivers. Wen Caishang’s red lips were slightly pressed; the sword was no longer under her control. The sword, heart, and body... were all pulled by Li Xian.
