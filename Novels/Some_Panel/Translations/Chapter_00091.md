Chapter 90: Sect's Stance

“This old bastard is absolutely mad, isn't he? My Lord, why did he suddenly attack you?” Buddha Child shrieked in shock from inside Yang Ji’s sleeve.

Seeing the square-faced Elder reach out to grab him, Yang Ji’s expression changed. He knew this palm strike was utterly unstoppable. He tried to move away, but found the surrounding world's momentum suppressed, leaving him momentarily unable to budge.

Just as the palm neared his face, a voice, gentle as a spring breeze and rain, suddenly sounded in his ear.

“Elder Qi, what’s wrong? Why are you suddenly attacking a disciple?” Without a sound, a figure had appeared before Yang Ji. With a single wave of his hand, a flash of divine light dispelled the square-faced Elder’s outstretched Daoist energy hand into nothingness.

“Daozi, you...” Elder Qi froze. He hadn’t expected Wang Tianli to intervene.

“Tell me the full story. I am here to uphold justice. Elder Qi, there’s no need to preemptively attack and seize the initiative,” Wang Tianli said with a gentle smile.

“Daozi, this disciple cultivates the Humanoid Weapon, which is a technique of the Eastern Orthodox Demonic Emperor. Some of our sect elders have died under that demon’s hand; I recognize this cultivation method very clearly,” Elder Qi stated sharply. “This disciple has a crooked mind and cultivates demonic arts. I suggest dragging him to the Life-and-Death Stage to be executed, to uphold the sect’s prestige.”

“Oh? The Eastern Orthodox Demonic Emperor’s technique, Humanoid Weapon?” Wang Tianli turned, curiously looking at Yang Ji twice.

“Executed? That old geezer is vicious! My Lord, they want to execute you just for cultivating a body-tempering technique? If he knew I cultivated the Demonic Buddha Scripture, wouldn’t he slice me into a thousand pieces? My Lord, this Dao Sect acts too brutally. Perhaps we should defect to the Demonic Sect instead. Since you cultivate a Demonic Emperor’s technique, becoming a Demonic Son shouldn't be difficult,” Buddha Child transmitted via spiritual sense, clutching Yang Ji’s robe tightly, terrified of falling out of the sleeve and being chopped up.

“Executed? Don’t chop Big Brother! He’s a good person,” Yang Tong suddenly said, wrinkling his nose.

Facing the Elder’s stern questioning, Yang Ji grew calmer. He bowed respectfully and said in a deep voice, “In this disciple’s view, there is no such thing as ‘demonic’ or ‘righteous’ techniques. Cultivation methods are merely means to pursue longevity. Good and evil stem from the heart; it depends on how the cultivator wields them.”

“This mere disciple still dares to quibble! Daozi, I suggest we detain him first,” Elder Qi said coldly, flicking his sleeve.

“My Lord, what relative of this old man did the Eastern Orthodox Demonic Emperor kill? To have such immense resentment, to infuriate him to this extent? Even shouting for the death of a sect disciple!” Buddha Child rolled his eyes, annoyed.

Wang Tianli smiled as he looked at the two. “Setting aside the cultivation method, you two actually have no personal grudges, do you?”

Elder Qi’s expression froze for a moment, then he nodded.

“Since that’s the case, why such a temper? Elder Qi, you still need to change your short temper. Before disciples, one must not lose composure,” Wang Tianli said with a gentle smile.

Elder Qi’s expression shifted, and he reined in his anger. He stared at Yang Ji and said, “I am the Punishing Elder of the sect’s ‘Hall of Rewarding Good and Punishing Evil.’ Considering your ignorance and mistaken cultivation of this technique, if you sever the Humanoid Weapon yourself, you can be exempt from sect punishment. As compensation, I am willing to offer you a body-tempering cultivation method.”

*Make me sever my own foundation? A joke! This is no different from destroying my path to immortality, cutting off my road to longevity. I absolutely cannot do it.*

But the situation dictated. Yang Ji still didn't dare to be too rigid, yet he couldn't remain silent. He had to fight for his interests. He spoke neither humbly nor arrogantly: “Elder, aren’t your words too severe?”

“Severe? You’re cultivating a Demonic Emperor’s technique! Not severe at all!” Elder Qi coldly snorted.

Wang Tianli looked at Elder Qi and smiled gently. “It’s not a universal creed that all demonic cultivation methods are bad, or that all demonic sect members are evil.”

“Elder Qi must not let the Eastern Orthodox Demonic Emperor influence his emotions. If you use this to punish a sect disciple, wouldn’t you lose another round to the Demonic Emperor?”

“In my view, for this junior brother to obtain the inheritance of a Demonic Sect Master indicates he is a person of great fortune. For the technique to be obtained by our Dao Sect disciple, this means the Demonic Emperor lost this round, and our Dao Sect absorbed their Demonic Sect’s fortune. This is a great good thing, so why punish him?”

“In a sense, this disciple has even won back a point for you, Elder Qi, and for our sect.”

Elder Qi’s expression was stunned. He stammered, “What Daozi says indeed makes some sense.”

Meanwhile, at the Boundless Pavilion, on the Ninth Heaven.

All the powerful elders of the Boundless Dao Sect were observing the situation through the Sky-monitoring Mirror.

Boundless Master suddenly asked, “Everyone, how do you view this matter?”

A Mahayana elder said, “Tianli is right. In a sense, our sect has indeed absorbed the fortune of his Heaven-Nether Demonic Sect. Cultivation methods are merely a way of cultivation; ultimately, one must return to one’s original heart. For major sects like ours, we cannot stir up mud in a pit. Our perspective must be elevated, our minds broad.”

Another Mahayana elder said, “As long as one is loyal to the sect and does not violate the heavenly dao or human morality, the means of handling matters need not be so extreme. Those of us present, who have reached the Mahayana stage, haven't we all comprehended methods from the hundred schools? Evil and demonic cannot be defined superficially.”

“Right and wrong are merely a matter of stance. Since he is a member of our Dao Sect, how can we apply the sword of the Demonic Sect to him?” another Mahayana elder added.

The beautiful woman suddenly smiled. “Hehe, actually this is an internal matter of your sect, and strictly speaking, I shouldn’t interfere. However, he blocked the Earth Demon for my young son. Emotionally, I must speak up for him.”

“This child single-handedly blocked the Earth Demon for a fellow disciple, which shows his kind heart, courage, and capability; he is not the type to be selfish and shrewd.”

“Furthermore, I’ve heard of this Humanoid Weapon; it’s merely a simple body-tempering and spirit-cultivating method, not a demonic art that devours flesh and blood or gnaws at souls. It cannot be considered evil.”

“Our sect’s Daozi, Fang Wanyang, even obtained the inheritance of the Ancient Demonic Emperor Chonglou, and isn’t he fine? For any prominent figure, who doesn't possess various inheritances? To lack the fortune to encounter techniques from various schools, *that* is mediocrity.”

The beautiful woman glanced sideways, smiling, “Boundless Sect Master, don’t stay silent. I believe you already have a decision in your heart.”

Boundless Master smiled slightly. “What Ziyu says is absolutely correct.”

He then looked at an elder. “Tell Tianli and Elder Qi to drop this matter.”

He paused, then added, “This disciple’s comprehension is quite good. He actually merged the True Adamant Dharma Idol with the Humanoid Weapon, which is quite a feat. Also, his fortune is rich; he is one who can stir up winds and clouds. From today onwards, secretly observe him according to the requirements for a True Disciple. During this period, do not deliberately interfere with his cultivation. Let’s see what fortune he brings.”

This last sentence was transmitted via spiritual sense; only the four Mahayana elders heard it.

In the Hellish Training Ground.

Above everyone’s heads, vital energy suddenly surged, and soon a spiritual energy vortex appeared in the sky. Following this, a scene manifested.

It was a celestial land of misty clouds on the Ninth Heaven, where many extraordinary figures were seated.

One of the venerable old men slowly spoke, “By the Sect Master’s order, this matter is concluded. Elder Qi shall no longer pursue this disciple’s responsibility. This disciple is meritorious in resisting the Earth Demon. Reward: one hundred bottles of Nascent Soul Pills.”

As he spoke, he waved out a streak of spiritual light, which scattered before Yang Ji, containing precisely one hundred bottles of Nascent Soul Pills.

Buddha Child giggled, “Haha, My Lord, a sudden turn of events! I was just about to plan our escape, but it seems we don’t need to now.”

Yang Ji was also somewhat surprised, but quickly regained his composure. He accepted the pills and bowed, “Thank you for the sect’s reward!”

The old man said gently, “Hm, you are a good disciple. We hope you cultivate well in the future and attain the Dao early.”

Yang Ji bowed, “This disciple will certainly cultivate well and not disappoint the sect’s expectations.”

Elder Qi, hearing the suddenly "gentle" tone of the conversation from above with Yang Ji, felt a sudden chill in his heart. He glanced at Yang Ji, then immediately bowed towards the sky, “I respectfully obey the Sect Master’s order!”

The venerable old man nodded. “Hm!” Then he looked at Wang Tianli. “Tianli, bring the injured disciples back to recuperate.”

Wang Tianli smiled slightly and nodded.
