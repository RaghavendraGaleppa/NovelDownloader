# Chapter 12: The Kill  

A crimson fireball hurtled downward with terrifying speed, striking sheer terror into the lizard demon beast.  

Clearly, it hadn't detected how its enemy had appeared.  

Yet, in its panic, it had no time to dodge.  

Fortunately, it was a water-attribute, lower-tier first-grade demon beast!  

*Pfft!*  

The lizard demon beast opened its grotesque maw, revealing a shimmering blue glow as demonic energy gathered within. A concentrated jet of blue water shot forth, colliding violently with the descending fireball.  

*Bang!*  

The moment fire met water midair, a sharp crack echoed.  

But in the next instant, the lizard's proud blue water jet sizzled under the fireball's scorching heat, evaporating entirely. The fireball, now slightly dimmed and reduced to the size of half a fist, still carried considerable force as it continued its descent.  

Fear flashed in the lizard's eyes. It spat another water jet at the incoming fireball before rolling aside, clearly not expecting the attack to fully block the flames.  

At its peak, it might have managed.  

But now, it only hoped to evade the fireball, regain its footing, and flee.  

*Bang!*  

The shrunken fireball clashed with the second water jet, extinguishing it, though the flames dwindled further to the size of a date before bursting into scattered embers that licked at the lizard's scaled hide.  

Despite its injuries, the lizard moved with desperate agility, narrowly avoiding the flames. Its eyes burned with hatred as it glared at Qi Chuan, who had revealed himself nearby. Then, it turned to flee.  

Qi Chuan sighed, swiftly forming hand seals.  

*Whoosh! Whoosh!*  

The ground around the lizard erupted as thick vines, as wide as arms, burst forth. They writhed like tentacles, twisting and coiling around the demon beast with ruthless precision.  

At the same time, Qi Chuan produced a handful of talismans. Infused with magic power, the papers ignited, conjuring five thumb-sized water arrows that sliced through the air toward the trapped lizard.  

The beast, now ensnared by the vines, struggled in vain—only tightening its bonds. Panic set in as it realized escape was impossible. In its weakened state, it couldn't even muster another water jet.  

Helpless, it could only watch as the five water arrows struck the gruesome wound on its back.  

*Splash!*  

The arrows exploded within the injury, spraying blood in all directions. A pained shriek tore from the lizard's throat.  

---  

Qi Chuan stepped forward cautiously, approaching the dying beast.  

The wound on its back had widened, stretching all the way to its neck. The lizard writhed and screeched, but each movement only worsened its condition. Soon, its breaths grew shallow, then ceased entirely.  

Qi Chuan waited a while longer before finally approaching. He gazed at the massive corpse, running his fingers over the smooth, cold scales of its head. A flicker of curiosity stirred in his eyes—this was his first time touching a real demon beast.  

Yet, why had it been so weak?  

He glanced back at the ruined spirit herbs in the field. Would the value of this beast's corpse even cover the damage?  

Regardless, eliminating a threat to the mountain and gaining materials was still a victory.  

After tidying the scene, he hauled the corpse to a storage shed, locked the door, and returned to his quarters. The night's exertions left him exhausted, and he slept deeply.  

---  

The next day, Second Elder returned.  

Qi Chuan immediately reported the incident.  

Qi Bai Cang's expression turned incredulous. He hurried to the storage shed and only believed the tale upon seeing the lizard's remains.  

"A real demon beast? How did it sneak in?"  

In all his years, Qi Bai Cang himself had slain only a handful of demon beasts. Even the weakest, lower-tier first-grade beasts matched early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators in strength. As a third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator, he had to exercise extreme caution against them.  

Yet his junior had killed one?  

"It happened last night. It ate a good portion of your spirit herbs. Its back bore a severe wound—already gravely injured. That made dealing with it easier," Qi Chuan explained.  

Qi Bai Cang clicked his tongue. "This is a 'Blue Lizard Demon.' Among lower-tier first-grade beasts, it's one of the stronger ones. And judging by its size, it was fully grown. Under normal circumstances, even a third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator would struggle."  

"Thankfully, it was already wounded. Otherwise, with me gone, you might have been in real danger."  

A trace of fear colored his words.  

"Second Elder, we're in Qi Maple Valley. All wild demon beasts here have been purged—only a few are kept by the clan. How did this lizard get in?" Qi Chuan asked, puzzled.  

Qi Bai Cang waved a hand dismissively. "Probably tied to the unrest outside."  

"With even the Xiao Clan—a foundation-establishment powerhouse—wiped out, it's no surprise if a lizard from the wild mountains fled due to some threat."  

"Still, while I was handling clan affairs, I heard the secret realm matter is nearing its end. The Wind Moon Sect likely claimed all its treasures. Once that's settled, the chaos should calm down."  

Qi Chuan nodded.  

So, in a way, this lizard was indirectly brought to him by the secret realm's upheaval.  

As for the Wind Moon Sect seizing the realm's treasures, he cared little. What mattered was the return of stability.  

After all, this time, it was just a lower-tier first-grade beast. What if something stronger invaded next?  

Shaking off the thought, he turned to the lizard's corpse. "What should we do with it?"  

Qi Bai Cang stroked his beard. "My suggestion? Sell it to the clan. Even if slain within clan territory, the kill is yours. The clan won't confiscate it, but they'll buy it at a fair price."  

"Besides, we can't process this ourselves. The meat would spoil before we could eat it all, and we have no immediate use for its materials."  

"Given its size, selling it should fetch a decent sum—enough for some cultivation pills."  

"Speaking of which, you've reached the second layer of Qi Refinement, haven't you?"  

He smiled knowingly at Qi Chuan.  

Qi Chuan nodded.  

Qi Bai Cang sighed, impressed. "I figured as much. Even a wounded adult Blue Lizard Demon wouldn't be easy prey for a first-layer cultivator. A second-layer stands a better chance."  

"But your progress... it's astonishing."  

While breaking through from the first to the second layer was relatively simple, achieving it within a year with an eighth-grade spiritual root was remarkable.  

Then again, Qi Chuan had reached the first layer in just a month—proof of his deep affinity with the *Evergreen Art*.  

"Still, advancing beyond the second layer requires far more accumulated magic power. Selling this beast for pills will make your future cultivation smoother."
