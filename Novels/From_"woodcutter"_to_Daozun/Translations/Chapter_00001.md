# Chapter 1: Sleeping Under the Thousand-Year Purple Myrtle Tree

Stars hung high, a bright moon suspended.

Xia Kingdom, Dongjiang Town.

Under the night sky, Chu Jiang slowly walked through the mountains, carrying two loads of firewood. A chopping axe and a wine gourd hung from his waist. He walked very slowly, occasionally taking a sip of wine.

He had been in this world for twenty years. Since childhood, he had followed his father chopping firewood and possessed considerable strength. A few years ago, his father passed away, and he inherited the family trade, becoming a woodcutter. Every day, he chopped wood, exchanged it for copper coins, bought some spirits, and lived a rather comfortable life. He thought of the old woodcutter in Journey to the West, chopping wood in his old age. He, on the other hand, was young and already selling firewood for wine, saving himself decades of detours! Thinking of this, Chu Jiang took out his wine gourd, took a sip, and warmed himself against the night's chill.

He didn't know how he had transmigrated into this world. Initially, he heard that this world had a martial arts world, martial arts techniques, and even tales of immortals and ghosts. The Xia Emperor even sent people to the East Sea to search for immortals, which excited him for a while. But as he delved deeper, he discovered that immortals in this world were merely legends. In the town, there were many martial arts schools and pugnacious martial artists. Chu Jiang had also considered going to a martial arts school to become an apprentice, but before he even grew up, he heard something. The master of a martial arts school was stabbed to death on the spot by several ruffians. A good tiger can't defeat a pack of wolves! To train diligently for a lifetime only to be unable to defeat a few ruffians. The Xia Emperor's East Sea Immortal-Seeking team hadn't found a single immortal in over a decade.

Chu Jiang abandoned the idea of practicing martial arts. He would chop wood every day, slowly save some money, find a wife, and be content with a wife, children, and a warm *kang* bed. In previous years, treating his father's illness had exhausted his savings. For his father's funeral, he borrowed some money from Uncle Lin next door. Once he returned, selling this firewood would allow him to pay off the debt. Then, save money, get a wife, wife and children, and a warm *kang*!

Chu Jiang thought with delight. A load of firewood could sell for twenty copper coins, and his daily expenses were only about ten, sometimes even less. Of course, he couldn't chop wood every day. Dongjiang Town received a lot of rain. In front was Changmin River, and behind were continuous mountain ranges. As the saying goes, "rely on the mountains to eat from the mountains, rely on the water to eat from the water." Dongjiang Town had the best of both worlds. Heavy rain prevented him from chopping wood, but on average, he could still save about a hundred copper coins a month, which was not bad compared to an ordinary waiter. A wife wasn't expensive; three to five taels of silver would be enough after saving for three to five years. Marry a wife at twenty-five! Wives in this world were good; they didn't talk back to men, handled all household chores, and prepared meals, waiting for their husbands to come home. He could entirely chop wood on sunny days and fish on rainy days. This life, truly wonderful!

Dreaming of the future, Chu Jiang walked along the forest path. Although it was night, he could discern the way by relying on the starlight and moonlight, and his experience. He had walked this path since childhood; the fierce beasts and venomous insects nearby had long been hunted down by the town's hunters.

"Hmm?"

Suddenly, the night before him grew even darker, pitch-black to the point where he couldn't see his outstretched hand. Chu Jiang looked up at the sky; it was also ink-black, the stars and moon all gone.

"Why is the sky suddenly so dark?" Chu Jiang frowned, "Is it going to rain? I hope it's not a heavy one."

He continued walking forward, but couldn't see anything at all. Further ahead was a steep mountain path. Even with his rich experience, Chu Jiang dared not proceed. If he fell, it wouldn't be something a few copper coins could cure. A hundred days for a broken bone or strained tendon, and in this ancient world, it could even be fatal!

"I'll just have to sleep in the mountains," Chu Jiang thought for a moment, pondered, then turned and walked to the left. There was a small path here, relatively flat ground, and he walked carefully through the forest. After about a quarter of an hour, Chu Jiang arrived under a large tree. The large tree was covered in vibrant red flowers, with flourishing branches and leaves. Chu Jiang reached out and touched a branch. The tree immediately trembled, as if alive, its branches and leaves contracting.

A Purple Myrtle tree!

Chu Jiang put down his firewood and sat under the Purple Myrtle tree. "If there are immortals in this world, they should worship you." Everyone in Dongjiang Town knew about this Purple Myrtle tree; it was said to have been growing for a thousand years. The Purple Myrtle tree was a sacred Daoist tree, symbolizing 'Purple Qi from the East' (an auspicious omen). For ordinary people, it signified prosperity and wealth. Once, a high-ranking official or noble wanted to bring this Purple Myrtle tree home. Unfortunately, before he could even arrive, he was imprisoned. There were rumors that this person's fate was not strong enough to bear the immense wealth brought by the Purple Myrtle tree. There was also a legend that only an emperor could subdue a thousand-year-old Purple Myrtle tree. Since then, no one had paid attention to the Purple Myrtle tree. Chu Jiang occasionally came to tease the tree when he had free time, watching its branches shake.

Taking a sip of wine to ward off the chill, he looked at the vast darkness, still unable to see his outstretched hand. "The old woodcutter, he pillows his head on pine roots under the moon. I'm going to pillow my head on the Purple Myrtle, it seems." Chu Jiang chuckled softly, lay down, and recited: "Watching the chess game until the axe handle rots, the 'ding-ding' of wood chopping, strolling slowly by the cloud-shrouded valley entrance. Selling firewood for wine, laughing wildly, lost in self-contentment. On the ancient path in high autumn, pillowing my head on the Purple Myrtle under the moon... wait... there's no moon now..." Although he lacked that kind of unrestrained freedom, he still felt a certain ease. Sleeping under a thousand-year Purple Myrtle tree, that old woodcutter certainly didn't have this luck. The night grew even darker, and Chu Jiang's consciousness slowly blurred as he gradually fell asleep.

The Purple Myrtle tree swayed slightly, gently swaying in the night. A wisp of purple light rose from the ground and entered Chu Jiang's body. In a hazy state, Chu Jiang had a dream. In his dream, he saw boundless purple qi, and the changing cloud formations in the sky: sometimes green, sometimes black, white, golden yellow, and crimson. The five colors intertwined, but purple remained independent, not merging with them. It seemed like an instant, yet also like ten thousand years had passed.

A drop of dew fell on his cheek, and Chu Jiang felt a chill spread through his body, causing him to jolt awake. He opened his eyes, sat up, and quickly took a gulp of wine to warm himself. He looked back, but was stunned: "Where's the Purple Myrtle tree?" The thousand-year Purple Myrtle tree was gone, the ground flat, as if it had never existed.

In his mind, purple light bloomed, and a piece of information emerged:

**Fate Trait: Purple Myrtle Qi Observation**
**Description:** Once daily, observe the qi of heaven and earth, seek good fortune and avoid calamity, determine the world's feng shui dragon veins.
**Heaven has clouds, Earth has qi:** Purple is noble, Yellow is revered, Green creates life, Black signifies death, White is ominous, Red is like Yang.

"This is... Purple Myrtle Qi Observation? An immortal's technique?" Chu Jiang was dumbfounded. Was it because of the thousand-year Purple Myrtle tree? Wasn't this a low-martial arts world? Had the legends of immortals become true?

Suddenly, his vision blurred, and his pupils turned white, as if he couldn't see anything. Immediately after, a compass appeared before his eyes, marked with East, South, West, North, and Center.

*   East is Green, signifying vitality and creation, very auspicious.
*   West is White, signifying killing and combat, bloodshed, very inauspicious.
*   South is Red, light red is auspicious, blood red is very inauspicious.
*   North is Black, gray-black signifies misfortune, pure black signifies death, very inauspicious.
*   Center is Yellow, signifying nobility. Yellow qi forming a dragon means an emperor, very auspicious.

If all was normal, the compass would not change. But now, on the compass, White appeared in the West, with faint apparitions of weapons and a hint of black interspersed. Blades and bloodshed! Extremely inauspicious!

In the Center, a patch of Green appeared, mixed with a hint of golden yellow. Below it, an earthy yellow light also emerged, not merging with the others, extremely auspicious! Center is Yellow, Earth is Yellow; the auspicious omen should be in the ground.

In the North, a hint of Red appeared, with shimmering water waves supporting the Red, slightly auspicious! North governs water, and water waves appeared again; the slightly auspicious omen should be in the water.

As for the South and East, there was no change, meaning everything was normal, neither auspicious nor inauspicious.

After receiving the information in his mind, the compass faded away. Chu Jiang's pupils returned to normal, but his heart was filled with shock. Could he really predict good and bad fortune?

"If I'm to interpret this myself, then the central green with gold just now should mean good fortune underground nearby?" Chu Jiang pondered in his mind, then quickly stood up. As soon as his gaze swept across, his whole body suddenly stiffened.

Long, oval, emerald-green leaves, gradually pointed at the tip, heart-shaped or nearly heart-shaped at the base. He swallowed, looking at the leaves in disbelief—Fleeceflower Root!
