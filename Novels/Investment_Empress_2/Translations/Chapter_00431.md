# Chapter 431: The Yin-Yang Past

“Everyone knows that to be a qualified Sect Master, one must be well-versed in the affairs of all peaks.”

Sect Master Qin stood with his arms crossed, looking extremely self-satisfied.

“That is why I have a slight understanding of the Yin-Yang Hall’s methods.”

“The Yin-Yang Hall teaches that solitary Yin does not birth, and solitary Yang does not grow. Only when Yin and Yang intersect can perfection be achieved. I only just recalled this after hearing Tian Miao speak of the principle that things reverse upon reaching an extreme, and after seeing the situation between you two.”

“What is the relationship between the two?”

Li Mo exhaled a hot, turbid breath. Though he remained serious, he couldn't help but feel curious.

As an ancient Summoning Sect Master, Qin Yuzhi definitely knew many shocking secrets, though her memory was faulty, working only intermittently.

Listen to her—“things reverse upon reaching an extreme.” Such profound principles must involve secrets of great magnitude.

Ying Bing also straightened up slightly, listening attentively.

Qin Yuzhi was very satisfied with their attentive, studious demeanor:

“You know the fourteenth generation master of the Yin-Yang Hall, who was also the Sect Master two generations before me... Forget it, you probably don’t know him...”

“Before that person, the Yin-Yang Hall was always very weak. Because the Dao of Yin-Yang can be said to be one path, or two, since men can only cultivate the Yang path, and women only the Yin...”

“Ahem!”

Li Mo’s expression changed slightly as he coughed heavily.

That was close. Sect Master Qin’s little mouth just keeps running; if you aren’t careful, she drops a bombshell. This is detrimental to the mental health of adolescents, you know!

“My memory was never good to begin with, don’t interrupt me randomly next time.”

Qin Yuzhi snorted before continuing. Fortunately, she phrased it differently this time:

“Men possess Yang filth, and women possess Yin turbidity. Both can only cultivate one aspect of Yin-Yang, unable to achieve the intersection of Yin and Yang, making the Great Dao difficult to attain. Therefore, for a long time, the Yin-Yang Hall did not produce a Seventh Realm Saint.”

“Until that person appeared! He was an unparalleled genius on the Yin-Yang path. In a very short time, he reached the Sixth Realm Law Body, possessing pure Yang martial arts rarely seen in the world. However, he also suffered from the affliction of solitary Yang not growing.”

“So he entered closed-door death seclusion to seek a breakthrough. After sitting motionless for three months, he actually produced a change!”

“That was: extreme Yang becomes Yin! After taking the path of pure Yang to the extreme, he became a woman!”

“??? Wait, hold on?”

Li Mo felt a chill down his spine and couldn't help but interrupt. “Does that mean I could also...”

Qin Yuzhi rolled her eyes. “Put your worries away, you’re far from that level. At most, you’re just a bit overheated.”

Li Mo sighed in relief. “I see.”

Qin Yuzhi retracted her gaze and continued:

“Then, she thus became the new Sect Master. Later, he also took the path of extreme Yin to the extreme, achieving ‘extreme Yin gives birth to Yang,’ and changed back.”

“For this, he even staged a: the old Sect Master was framed and imprisoned, endured hardships, finally saw the light of day, rectified the wrongs, defeated the usurping witch, and returned as the king.”

“If I hadn’t visited his dreams, I wouldn’t have known these two Sect Masters were actually the same person...”

Speaking of this, Qin Yuzhi shuddered, as if remembering it made her eyes feel dirty.

Ying Bing: “.....”

Tian Miao: “.....”

Li Mo: “.....”

This is wilder than wild history! If such talents kept emerging, it’s not hard to understand how the Summoning Sect, which once managed the power of all living beings in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, fell to a state where everyone shouts and beats it now.

“You aren’t planning on teaching us that method, are you? I have no interest.”

Li Mo expressed his refusal.

Qin Yuzhi tapped her sect-master-exclusive enamel cup and said impatiently:

---

“Look at you, getting anxious again. Let me finish speaking first! Doesn’t a story need a beginning?”

“.....”

Why don’t you just start from the creation of the universe then...

Li Mo吐槽ed (complained) in his heart, but he still cupped his fists, signaling for her to continue.

“Hmph. Later, that person held the Dao of Extreme Yang and the Dao of Extreme Yin respectively. However, these were still two separate paths. So he immersed himself in research again on how to unite them.”

“In the end, he really found a method: Dual Cultivation! Creating a method for men and women to cultivate together, harmonizing Yin and Yang!”

“Ah?”

Li Mo was dumbfounded.

What the hell is this, the founder of the Joyful Sect!

“Take back those unorthodox eyes of yours. That is indeed an orthodox method, fully explaining the mysteries of Yin and Yang.”

“It just happens to suit your current situation perfectly. Hmph, ordinary people who want to learn this lost secret technique wouldn’t even have the fate!”

Qin Yuzhi snapped her fingers, and two dream-like bubbles flew out from her sleeves, entering the space between Li Mo and Ying Bing’s eyebrows.

Understanding surged forth. Ying Bing frowned at first, then her brows gradually relaxed.

This was indeed an orthodox method of the Xuanmen.

Of course, it also requires the cultivator to maintain a clear and clear heart.

A clear and clear heart...嗯 (hmm), I have always been like that.

She glanced at Li Mo and found that Student Li looked righteous and determined; anyone would say he is a gentleman.

“.....”

“Hiss... truly impressive. The person who created this method must be a heaven-defying genius.”

After accepting the method from the bubble, Li Mo asked curiously:

“So how did he eventually abdicate and let you become the Sect Master?”

Qin Yuzhi felt this question was a bit rude. She remained silent for a moment and said:

“He went down a crooked path. First, many people came looking for him to invert Yin and Yang. At first, it was some palace eunuchs, and later even some people who wanted to experience another life sought him out. This violated the law.”

“Ah?”

The path of crime is indeed a crooked path...

“Second, the law has no good or evil, but people do. Later, some people, in pursuit of efficiency, gradually lost their original hearts. They no longer engaged in Yin-Yang harmonization beneficial to both parties, but instead went down the evil path of Yang extraction.”

“Anyway, later on, the Yin-Yang Hall did not maintain balance but instead led to the inversion of Yin and Yang. Moreover, some concubines became pregnant with the bastards of eunuchs. Finally, the Shang Emperor of the dynasty flew into a rage and dismissed him.”

“......It feels like the main reason was the harem issues.”

“In the end, he left with a group of close followers in despair and founded something... oh, right, the Joyful Sect.”

“Pfft...”

Li Mo couldn't catch his breath and almost choked to death on the Snow Spirit Ginseng.

So he really is the founder of the Joyful Sect!

So strictly speaking, this dual cultivation technique originated from the founder of the Joyful Sect...

Li Mo scratched his neck and took a look at the Ice Cube.

Ying Bing’s face was as cold as frost, cool and aloof.

If you ignored her trembling eyelashes and the wailing big-headed doll.

The Cold Fairy looked single-minded at a glance.
