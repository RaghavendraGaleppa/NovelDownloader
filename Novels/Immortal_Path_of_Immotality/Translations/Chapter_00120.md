# Chapter 120: One Against Three

The battlefield was in utter chaos. Dozens of East Sea rogue cultivators relentlessly besieged the Black and Red Twin Fiends. Despite both being at the Foundation Establishment stage, prolonged combat was wearing them down.

As they desperately circulated their spiritual energy to purge the toxins, it became clear that the green poisonous mist was Black Fiend's painstakingly crafted masterpiece—a trump card he had spent decades refining with countless deadly poisons. 

Yet Lin Shan had effortlessly blown it all back at them with a simple gust of wind.

Not only were they terrified, but their fury was literally making them sick. All those years spent enhancing the poison's potency, and they'd never considered how easily wind-based cultivators could counter it!

Worse still, their primary techniques—puppetry and summoning—were completely ineffective. Any summoned creatures were instantly obliterated by Lin Shan's Five Elements Magic Fan. Who in the cultivation world had invented such an unreasonable artifact? 

Utterly shameless!

Now they were pouring all their spiritual energy into resisting the poison mist. Their defensive artifacts and talismans were on the verge of collapse, unable to hold much longer. 

Artifacts required spiritual energy to function, and talismans had time limits and durability. Under the sustained barrage from dozens of Qi Condensation cultivators, anyone would eventually be overwhelmed.

During this time, the Twin Fiends had attempted to attack the group on the white cloud with their artifacts, but the high-grade Cloud-Subduing Banner formed an impenetrable defense. Seeing their safety assured, Lin Shan's underlings grew even more enthusiastic.

[What's it like for Qi Condensation cultivators to beat up Foundation Establishment experts?]

Lin Shan's followers unanimously responded: Thanks for asking! Currently in the East Sea, riding a cloud, and it feels absolutely exhilarating!

Normally meek and submissive, they were now hurling insults and throwing punches from their lofty perch. 

Foundation Establishment experts? Today, we're beating them up!

As the lowest-tier rogue cultivators of the East Sea, they'd endured endless bullying. After being abducted by the three demonic sects, they'd lived in constant fear. Now with this chance to vent, they attacked with frenzied abandon.

The Twin Fiends finally realized with despair that their meticulously crafted poison mist had no antidote—they were being poisoned by their own creation!

[What's it like to be felled by your own poison when you never bothered making a cure?]

Black and Red Twin Fiends: *Unintelligible cursing*

Amid the dazzling array of spells and swarms of insects dancing around them, the already heavily injured brothers finally exhausted their spiritual energy. Their protective barriers shattered with a *crack*.

Lin Shan's Five Elements Magic Fan then engulfed them in a towering river of flames...

Bear Mountain Master felt his heart turn cold. His companions, the Black and Red Twin Fiends—both early Foundation Establishment cultivators—had been effortlessly eliminated without contributing anything. Now he stood alone against Lin Shan.

Though at mid-Foundation Establishment he might have stood a chance, Lin Shan's earlier ambush had left him injured. Facing a barrage of high-grade artifacts, he began contemplating retreat. 

With his allies dead, there was no reason to stay.

As a notorious pirate leader of the East Sea, Bear Mountain Master knew when to cut his losses. Running from fights was second nature to him.

He recalled his Mother-Child Nails and flying needles, eyeing the high-grade Black Iron Sword locked in combat with Lin Shan's weapon. Reluctance gnawed at him—if he withdrew his sword, how would he defend against Lin Shan's pursuit?

After all, sword flight required acceleration time. 

He couldn't instantly reach top speed, and in the time it took to turn and flee, Lin Shan's flying sword would dice him to pieces!

Weighing his options, he remembered his recent induction into the Black Lotus Sect under a Golden Core protector's patronage. This high-grade flying sword was newly acquired—losing it now would be painful.

Resigned, he produced his old high-grade artifact: a spiked club.

This very club had been split in two by Purple Sky Sect's Thunder Rain during the East Sea Conference at Turtle Fishing Island. He'd later purchased deep-sea coral worm saliva to reattach it.

The artificer had warned him: full adhesion would take five years, and he should avoid using it during that period.

But survival trumped all concerns. Bear Mountain Master couldn't bear abandoning his flying sword—like all impoverished rogue cultivators, every spirit stone counted, let alone a flying sword!

With a sudden leap, his flying sword disengaged from Lin Shan and shot beneath his feet, carrying him skyward in a desperate escape.

Lin Shan's flying sword gave chase instantly.

*Clang!*

A crisp metallic ring echoed as Bear Mountain Master stared blankly at his club—now split in two again.

*Thud.*

Half the spiked weapon clattered to the ground, rolling to a stop.

Lin Shan blinked in momentary confusion. 

This scene felt oddly familiar...

Across the vast East Sea waves, two figures pursued each other in a deadly chase.

---

Lin Shan smirked coldly. As a wind-aligned cultivator, did this water-aligned fool really think he could outrun him?

Just as expected, despite Bear Mountain Master's desperate flight, Lin Shan rapidly closed the gap. Water-aligned techniques excelled in healing and corrosion—how could they compete with wind's natural speed?

Moreover, after cultivating the *Wind Thunder Scripture*, Lin Shan's spiritual energy carried lightning. At full speed, crackling electricity surrounded him, making his movement truly meteoric.

When Lin Shan closed within five paces and raised his Five Elements Magic Fan for a decisive strike, Bear Mountain Master finally made a painful decision—producing a nearly depleted water-blue talisman.

Before Lin Shan could react, the pirate leader plunged into the sea and vanished.

"Water Escape Talisman!"

Lin Shan exclaimed in disbelief. He'd underestimated this pirate captain. No wonder the man had survived his notorious career—he had escape methods after all.

Recovering quickly, Lin Shan scanned the waters with his spiritual sense. Detecting a faint trace, he produced his own Wind Escape Talisman.

With a faint shimmer, he dissolved into the wind.

Ten miles away, a bearded head broke the ocean's surface.

Bear Mountain Master had barely stored his talisman when a whirlwind manifested above him—Lin Shan materialized mid-air.

"!!!"

Terrified at the sight of Lin Shan's Wind Escape Talisman, Bear Mountain Master ducked underwater and activated his talisman again.

Thus began a hundred-mile chase across the sea, with both men burning through their precious escape talismans.

Ultimately, Lin Shan lost his quarry in the vast ocean.

---

Returning to Red Prawn Island, Lin Shan's expression was thunderous.

Not only had Bear Mountain Master escaped, but he'd wasted multiple Wind Escape Talismans—his precious life-saving cards!

In the ocean, Water Escape Talismans held the advantage. The pirate's movements through water left traces easily masked by marine life, making the loss inevitable.

To add insult to injury, Bear Mountain Master had taunted him before escaping, vowing "this isn't over!"

How dare that bastard threaten him? As if he had the right!

His followers, still basking in the thrill of killing the Twin Fiends, immediately fell silent upon seeing their leader's stormy return.

---

His loyal lackey Old Zhong respectfully presented the Cloud-Subduing Banner.

Lin Shan reclaimed his artifact and examined the Twin Fiends' corpses—now covered in green mold as the poison took full effect post-mortem, rendering them unrecognizable.

Their storage pouches remained untouched; none of the rogue cultivators dared claim them, each fearing betrayal if they tried.

Lin Shan summoned the pouches to himself for later inspection.

Then he noticed something on the ground—Bear Mountain Master's abandoned broken spiked club.

"Hmm?"

Lin Shan's mood instantly improved, a sinister smile curling his lips.

Did that fool think escaping meant safety? Had he never heard of killing someone without lifting a finger? Enjoy the suffering to come!

Seeing their leader's rapidly shifting expressions and sudden eerie laughter, the surrounding underlings instinctively tensed, quietly shrinking back in fear.
