# Chapter 51: Grand Unity Golden Splendor Elixir Scripture

Within Skull Mountain Market, seeing Lü Yang and Yun Miaozhen vanish, everyone knew it was the power of the Glazed Dharma Sword, suspended in the air.

Witnessing this, Luo Wuya's expression was grim, but inwardly he rejoiced.

'A Foundation Establishment True Person, truly their divine abilities are unfathomable. Senior Brother actually managed to lure in such a big fish! The Sky-Escaping Sword, this spiritual treasure, has appeared once more!'

This treasure ranks thirty-seventh among the One Hundred and Eight Renowned Swords of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, first among the Earthly Fiends. Though not a spirit treasure, it surpasses one. It contains a Mustard Seed Grotto-Heaven within. When battling, one only needs to illuminate an opponent with its sword light to transport them into the grotto-heaven, thereby gaining all strategic advantages.

Within the grotto-heaven, the Sword Pavilion cultivator's magic power is replenished by the grotto-heaven, and ordinary divine abilities consume no magic power. In contrast, non-Sword Pavilion cultivators, once trapped in the grotto-heaven, first have 30% of their true qi reduced, then 30% of their divine abilities weakened, and finally, the power of their spiritual treasures decreased by 30%. With one side strengthened and the other weakened, the outcome was decided.

This was also why Yun Miaozhen remained confident despite knowing Lü Yang was protected by a double array formation; she understood that a double array formation could not withstand the Sky-Escaping Sword's grasp. In fact, most Five Elements objects could not stop the Sky-Escaping Sword. The only way to block the Sky-Escaping Sword with an array formation was to use one that also involved spatial changes, but such array formations were exceedingly rare. And even if one existed, it wasn't something a Ninth-Rank Array Master could set up.

"It seems then, this demonic scoundrel is surely doomed this time!"

On the other side, Shenwu Sect Elder Ouyang Feng clapped his hands and laughed heartily. Though he couldn't take revenge personally, Lü Yang's death would still resolve the great hatred in his heart.

Hearing this, Luo Wuya could only shake his head without refuting, because he secretly thought the same. If Lü Yang had been protected by a double array formation, their fight might have been fifty-fifty, but falling into the Sky-Escaping Sword truly meant certain death. Even if it were him, he would likely be in danger.

"However... this also perfectly suits Senior Brother's intentions."

"That Lü Yang doesn't know what's good for him, repeatedly defying the karma Senior Brother has stirred. Senior Brother deliberately lured Yun Miaozhen here, likely harboring the intent to kill with a borrowed knife..."

Thinking this, Luo Wuya became completely at ease. Although they were both disciples of the Sacred Sect, he had no intention of offering aid, merely waiting for Lü Yang to be killed and Yun Miaozhen to seize his fortune, so that the Shaman Ghost Secret Realm could be opened.

Meanwhile, inside the Sky-Escaping Sword.

The sword light shone down, and even layers of array formations could not stop it. By the time Lü Yang regained his senses, his vision cleared, and his surroundings had completely changed. What met his eyes was a land ravaged by sword qi. As the sword qi descended, Lü Yang immediately felt 30% of his true qi weaken, and activating divine abilities became much more hindered, knowing this was the suppression within the grotto-heaven.

The next second, a great celestial light appeared above, and Yun Miaozhen stepped out.

"Initial Saint Demonic Scoundrel, today you shall face this tribulation and be executed!"

A clear, resonant voice descended from the heavens, truly like an immortal speaking divine decrees. With a single word, Lü Yang immediately felt the entire world turn against him, seeking to tear him into ten thousand pieces.

After speaking, Yun Miaozhen pushed her Daoist crown, and instantly a dazzling golden splendor appeared, illuminating the sky. It then split into three streams of light: gold, silver, and jade, coiling around her like swimming dragons, connected head to tail, interlocking, making her appear even more magnificent and solemn.

Lü Yang's expression grew increasingly solemn at the sight. After cultivating for several lifetimes, he was no longer as unfamiliar with the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion as he once was. With a little thought, he recognized the divine ability Yun Miaozhen was employing.

"This is the 'Grand Unity Golden Splendor Elixir Scripture'... a Grand Divine Ability of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion!"

Thinking this, a great alarm rang in Lü Yang's heart. The 'True Corpse Exuviation Art of Lunar Transformation' in his possession was also a Grand Divine Ability. Precisely because of this, he dared not underestimate the power of Grand Divine Abilities in the slightest.

"Now, I really have to fight for my life..." Lü Yang's thoughts raced.

To his knowledge, the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion's 'Grand Unity Golden Splendor Elixir Scripture' could cultivate three streams of splendor: gold, silver, and jade, each being a superior divine ability. To cultivate this Grand Divine Ability to perfection, one must achieve "Three Splendors Converging at the Crown," refining the three streams of splendor into a single "Grand Unity Golden Splendor." The Grand Unity Golden Splendor not only possesses all the effects of the three individual splendors but also sees its power multiply, even boosting the breakthrough to Foundation Establishment!

'...Fortunately, her divine ability doesn't seem to be perfected yet.'

As the saying goes, "The Great Dao is One." If the divine ability were perfected, Yun Miaozhen wouldn't have split into three streams of splendor; there would only be a single Grand Unity Golden Splendor.

'Perhaps this is my chance...'

Just then, Yun Miaozhen made her move. She unfurled her sleeve, and the golden splendor around her moved according to her will, engulfing Lü Yang's position. Lü Yang immediately retreated. The golden light was called "Divine Light," moving with the mind; if the mind was disturbed, one would self-immolate. Therefore, if even a speck of it touched one, inner heart-fire would immediately erupt, causing the body to glow golden and burn. Without a method to suppress it, one would turn into a handful of ash within a short time.

"Go!"

With a thought, Lü Yang sent his Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light soaring upwards. The monstrous blood light forcibly resisted the descending golden splendor, and the two remained in a stalemate in mid-air.

Yun Miaozhen, seeing this, immediately pressed her brow. The next second, a sword pill emerged, like a streaking light and flying lightning, disappearing in an instant. When it reappeared, it was already above Lü Yang's head, striking down directly—

*Clang! Clang!*

Sword qi whistled down, but Lü Yang's Blood Yang Sword Pill was isolated outside the grotto-heaven. He could only sigh, manifesting a Wind-Thunder Treasure Mirror behind his head: The Grand Firmament Mirror!

The mirror surface shimmered, and instantly wind and thunder followed. The "Grand Firmament Wind-Thunder Qi" within the mirror immediately conjured bolts of lightning, wrapped in howling yin wind, forcefully restraining Yun Miaozhen's sword pill, as if a vortex had captured it and refused to let go. Rolling wind and thunder continuously eroded the sword qi on the sword pill.

Yun Miaozhen, seeing this, was not flustered. Instead, she let out a cold laugh. Although decisive in her actions, she was not reckless. Even before coming to the market and striking at Lü Yang, she had already thoroughly investigated his information. Array formations, the Grand Firmament Mirror – all were within her expectations. Now, having used the Sky-Escaping Sword to bypass the array formations and her sword pill to restrain the Grand Firmament Mirror, Yun Miaozhen felt victory was assured and immediately decided to deliver the decisive blow.

The next second, Yun Miaozhen simultaneously shook the silver and jade splendors by her side. These two were "Qi Light" and "Essence Light," respectively. The former could shatter all qi under heaven, and the latter could cut through steel and bone. Shaking them together now, they merged into a crystalline, clear sword light that slashed down towards Lü Yang!

"As expected of a Sword Pavilion true disciple..."

Lü Yang could only sigh at the sight. Yun Miaozhen was clearly no hothouse flower; her execution of tactics and timing were remarkably precise. In this situation, she also commanded a Grand Divine Ability. Although not yet perfected, it was only one final step of fusion away. At the very least, she had fully mastered the three divine abilities that served as its components.

In comparison, Lü Yang's mastery of the 'True Corpse Exuviation Art of Lunar Transformation' was far inferior. The final divine ability, "Supreme Purity Imperial Edict Treasure Talisman," was still stuck at a bottleneck, making no progress. He hadn't even gathered all three divine abilities, let alone integrated them thoroughly.

"In direct combat, I'm not her match..."

Lü Yang clearly realized this. And ultimately, he wasn't skilled in direct combat; he excelled at bullying the weak with superior cultivation. But now? Yun Miaozhen was at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation, while he was at the eighth. Forget fighting at the same realm, he was even attempting to challenge a stronger opponent from a lower realm, which was completely against his style.

'If this were a few months ago, I probably would have had to choose to restart.'

However, now there was another variable.

The next second, facing the two streams of sword light unleashed by Yun Miaozhen, Lü Yang raised his hand and successively threw out two talismans, which exploded in mid-air.

*Boom!*

With a loud bang, a bolt of lightning and a stream of sword qi roared forth, incredibly blocking Yun Miaozhen's descending sword light at the crucial moment!

"Ninth-Rank Talismans!?"

Yun Miaozhen's brow twitched slightly, but she quickly regained her composure. "Only two, still a drop in the bucket. How many talismans do you have?"

As a true disciple of the Sword Pavilion, although she didn't study talismanship, she wasn't unfamiliar with it. For a ranked talisman, even if only Ninth-Rank, a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator would need at least three days to draw one, and they would have to set aside all other matters to focus solely on drawing the talisman. Therefore, she was certain that Lü Yang had no more than a handful of talismans.

The next second, Lü Yang waved his hand again. Then, a scene that stunned Yun Miaozhen unfolded: the second, third, fourth... dozens, even hundreds of talismans spread across the sky!

And behind the sky full of talismans, Lü Yang waved the Myriad Spirit Banner, and a host of banner spirits were still working overtime, rushing production.

"How many can I have? Don't compare your individual cultivator's small workshop output with mine. Let me show you the power of black-hearted industrial assembly line production!"

As his voice fell, all the talismans moved in unison. In an instant, sword qi and thunder light intertwined, illuminating the entire grotto-heaven! And illuminated along with it was Yun Miaozhen's astonished and twisted face!
