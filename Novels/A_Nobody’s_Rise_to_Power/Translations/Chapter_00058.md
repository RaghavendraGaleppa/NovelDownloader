# Chapter 58: Blacken, My Lord of the Manor

The family members of Zhang Yunyi only knew that they had lost their freedom. However, they did not know that the fire was set by the Lord's own eldest son, Zhang Xinran. They were even less aware of the true situation at the barn, as the Suo family had already sealed off the scene.

The Zhang family members poured out everything they knew to Zhang Xiaomi.

Upon hearing this, Zhang Xiaomi flew into a rage. He slammed his cane into the ground and shouted sternly, "How innocent is my Lord? Even if the stewards of the manor are guilty, how many of them committed capital offenses? Yet, the main branch has detained them, and now they have all perished in a fire. Who will take responsibility for this?"

Zhang Xiaomi deliberately included the stewards in his accusation because he saw the commoners of Feng'an Manor gathering around; among them were surely the families of those stewards. As long as he could incite them and have them wail their way up Phoenix Mountain in mourning clothes, they could naturally pressure the Clan Lord.

"You must give this old man an explanation! You owe an explanation to our Zhang family and to the families of all the stewards!" Zhang Xiaomi shouted, trembling as he charged toward a Suo family guard blocking the way.

"Uncle Xiaomi, I and all the stewards are perfectly fine. What explanation are you looking for?" a voice suddenly rang out.

The Zhang family members felt as if struck by lightning and froze on the spot.

This... This was Zhang Yunyi's voice! Hadn't he been burned to ash? Was this a ghost?

Zhang Yunyi walked out step by step from among the stunned commoners. Behind him were all the stewards of Feng'an Manor.

Zhang Xiaomi was stunned on the spot, stammering, "Yun... Yunyi!"

Zhang Yunyi said coldly, "Uncle, seeing that your nephew is still alive, are you surprised? Are you disappointed?"

A gurgling sound came from Zhang Xiaomi's throat, and for a moment, he could not speak another word. The women of the Zhang family were overjoyed, while only the Young Master Zhang's face turned ashen.

Zhang Yunyi gave his son a deep look, a flash of profound pain crossing the bottom of his eyes, which then turned into a dead-ash-like resignation. The one who wanted to burn him to ash was his own flesh and blood.

He slowly turned to face the commoners of Feng'an Manor. "Fellow villagers of Feng'an Manor, the Zhang family is truly unfortunate!" Zhang Yunyi suddenly pointed at Zhang Xinran, his voice shrill. "This unfilial son, behind my back, harmed the main family and committed many heinous acts. Now that the main branch has sent Steward Yang to inspect, knowing he could no longer hide his crimes, he actually conspired with his grand-uncle to murder me and Steward Yang together!"

At these words, the commoners were instantly thrown into an uproar. Patricide? This was an explosive topic at any time.

The women of the Zhang family were greatly surprised by this. Madam Zhang hesitated and said, "Master, such a major matter cannot be taken lightly..."

Zhang Yunyi gave her a cold look. As his wedded wife, Madam Zhang had never seen such an icy gaze from her husband and was instantly choked.

Zhang Yunyi suddenly smiled. "Madam, if it weren't true, do you think I would falsely accuse my own flesh and blood?"

Madam Zhang was speechless, her face turning extremely ugly. She did not want to lose either her husband or her son, but now the father and son were at each other's throats.

Zhang Yunyi waved his hand and shouted sternly, "Men, seize Zhang Xiaomi and Zhang Xinran!"

Kang Zhengyang and Leopard Head immediately moved to grab Zhang Xiaomi and Zhang Xinran.

*Swish!*

Kang Zhengyang spread his five fingers wide, but he only caught Zhang Xiaomi's clothes. The old fellow pulled a "Tyrant Discarding His Armor," struggled with both arms, and leaped forward, leaving only a robe behind on the spot.

The old fellow usually looked senile, but now he moved as fast as a startled rabbit. The old rabbit charged toward Yang Can with his cane.

The person of highest status on the scene was Yang Can. He also looked like the one least capable of fighting. If they could capture him, they could use him as a hostage.

Yang Can's hand suddenly moved to his waist. When he was studying the curved plow with Blacksmith Li, he had the blacksmith's little apprentice forge a stack of iron cards for him. A stack of thin pig iron sheets, said to be used for making leaf cards. It was possible to make leaf cards out of iron, but it would just be a toy; very few people used iron for such a purpose. But since Yang Can made the request, Blacksmith Li naturally agreed.

These iron cards were now inserted into his leather waistband. Leather waistbands are mostly used by soldiers and warriors, but they are also tools for riders to reduce waist strain. Traveling in Longshang mostly requires riding a horse, so Yang Can also wore a relatively wide leather waistband. The iron cards were inserted into his leather waistband, leaving only a finger's width exposed at the top.

Yang Can's hand had just touched the cards when a figure flashed past him, incredibly agile. The old rabbit hopped over and drew the sword hidden in his cane.

But the figure that flashed past Yang Can's side slid over like a fish. He stuck to Zhang Xiaomi's cane sword, reaching an extreme and exquisite level of danger. In the blink of an eye, he had crashed into Zhang Xiaomi's chest, his palms interweaving, and his power burst forth.

Zhang Xiaomi was not as old as he appeared, but he was no master of combat either. He had managed to escape Kang Zhengyang's control solely because his usual senile appearance was deeply ingrained in people's minds. Now, two palms struck his chest and abdomen. Zhang Xiaomi was already old, his energy fading, and his bones brittle.

With a *bang*, his chest immediately caved in. His body fell backward, and he spat blood to the sky. Zhang Xiaomi fell heavily to the ground, sliding back nearly a zhang.

"Grandfather!" His three grandsons cried out and were about to rush forward, but the steel knives pressed against their necks immediately sank lower.

"You... who are you..." the eldest of the Zhang family asked on his deathbed. Three of his ribs were broken, and his sternum had collapsed. He spat out large mouthfuls of blood, glaring fixedly at the figure before him.

That person, however, did not look at him but turned around gracefully. Zhang Xiaomi only saw a delicate背影 (back).

Qingmei looked at Yang Can and smiled beautifully. "Master, don't be afraid. I said I would protect you, and I will keep my word!"

"Lord Zhang, now, should we report what happened here to the Clan Lord for his decision, or..." After sending everyone away, Yang Can asked Zhang Yunyi politely.

"No, they are my family. This is my family matter. So... I would like to clean up the门户 (family/clan) myself, one last time, as the head of the Zhang family," Zhang Yunyi said. He took a step back, lifted the hem of his robe, and knelt before Yang Can. "Please grant my request, Steward Yang!"

As he knelt, his robe was stained with much black ash. The place where Yang Can spoke to him was this burned-down guest house area.

"Since that is the case, I will leave everything to you," Yang Can said. He patted Zhang Yunyi's shoulder. "You know, I am a scholar. I cannot bear to see killing." Yang Can shook his head, sighed, and turned away.

Zhang Yunyi slowly stood up and said calmly to Leopard Head, "I trouble you, Guard Cheng, to escort everyone to the threshing ground."

Cheng Dakuan nodded and strode away.

The threshing ground was the very grain-drying field where Kang Zhengyang had assembled his men at night. It was an open space in the village, where the Lord would gather the villagers to announce important matters. Today, the great bell of Feng'an Manor was rung. It was the command to assemble all the villagers.

The villagers, supporting the old and carrying the young, began to gather at the threshing ground from all directions. In the center of the square was a earthen platform about two chi high. This was the place in the village where punishments were carried out on villagers who violated village rules or外来 (external) thieves. There were six wooden pillars on the earthen platform. The Young Master Zhang, the dying Zhang Xiaomi, and Zhang Xiaomi's three grandsons were all tied to the pillars.

Below the platform was a group of people standing in陪绑 (accompanying the punishment, meaning they were also tied up but might not be executed), including those stewards who had almost been burned to death.

Zhang Yunyi stood on the platform, his expression calm. Everyone thought he was dead, but he wasn't. Everyone thought he was finished, but... he wasn't. He was still the person in charge of Feng'an Manor; Yang Can didn't even show his shadow, because he was kind.

Only Madam Zhang, who had been married to him for many years, saw a hint of madness in her husband's eyes. She felt that her husband was not normal now, very not normal. It was no wonder. A day ago, he was the patriarch of the Zhang family, the head of the household. In a single night, he suffered the most painful betrayal. He had worked his heart out for this family, but the return he got was an attempt to turn him into a pile of charcoal. Everything he had guarded and insisted on had become a joke. The one who wanted to kill him was his own relative, only they had failed. Now he was about to kill his own relatives in return; how could his spirit be normal?

The people tied on the platform had rags stuffed in their mouths. They looked terrified but could not utter a single word. The dying Zhang Xiaomi was an elder, so he was granted a dignified death: hanging. This was the punishment decided by the Zhang family head, Zhang Yunyi, according to the family rules. Even if the Clan Lord came in person, he could not stop the execution of family law.

Soon, Zhang Xiaomi was carried onto a simple gallows by the Zhang family guards. When he finally stopped struggling on the gallows, the urine from his incontinence dripped down his shoes to the ground.

At this time, Zhang Yunyi began to announce the punishment for the others. The Young Master Zhang and his three cousins were tied tightly to the pillars, unable to move. A team of men carried over a dozen large baskets to the front of the platform with long poles. Inside the baskets were goose-egg-sized stones.

In remote villages, using私刑 (private punishment) to solve problems is very common. Drowning, lighting a sky lantern, or beating someone to death with stones are all common punishment methods in the manors and tribes of Longshang. The main point is that it is ritualistic and can use local materials without wasting money. Among these, the most painful and prolonged death is, of course, "stoning." This kind of torture is not only painful but also requires the collective punishment of all villagers. Therefore, it is only applied to those who have committed heinous crimes and seriously violated universal values. The most common crimes of this type are incest and patricide.

The Young Master Zhang and his three cousins had committed such unforgivable sins. Despite Zhang Yunyi's previous calm demeanor, the muscles on his cheeks were now twitching. He stood on the platform and shouted sternly, "Everyone,动手 (make a move)! Beat these heartless beasts to death!"

"Stay your hands! Stay your hands!" someone shouted from a distance. By the time he shouted the second sentence, he was much closer,显然是 (obviously) riding a horse at full speed.

Zhang Yunyi turned a deaf ear and shouted sternly, "Why aren't you making a move!"

The Zhang family steward, Wan Tai, glared and was the first to rush up, grab a stone, and hurl it onto the platform. As he threw, he shouted at the top of his lungs, "Everyone, make a move! The Lord is watching from the platform!"

Countless stones flew toward the platform like a rain of hail. Seeing her son become a bloody mess in an instant, Madam Zhang let out a tragic scream and fainted on the spot. But Zhang Yunyi opened his eyes wide, watching with an expression of satisfaction.
