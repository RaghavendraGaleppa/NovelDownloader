# Chapter 186: Worshipped by a Near-Immortal Being

A strong sense of unease welled up in Qin Ming. He hadn't even left the Fourth Forbidden Land yet, and now he encountered people from the First Forbidden Land. This was truly one wave after another.

Wu Yaozu shouted, "Whether it's the First or the Fourth, they're all Forbidden Lands, we're allies! Marrying my Brother Ming, you must treat him well. Don't make things difficult for him!"

Qin Ming shot him a "resentful" look. Was this brother truly straightforward, or just a bit of a troublemaker?

With a soft thump, he fell into the red palanquin, and the slender, fair hand that had pulled him in retracted.

Wu Yaozu crawled up from the mist-shrouded ground. Should he run alone, or wait for Brother Qin? He gazed forward.

The vast wedding procession was boundless and dense, truly too magnificent.

"Is this the prestige of the First Forbidden Land? It's not an insult to my Brother Ming after all!" Wu Yaozu muttered to himself.

Inside the red palanquin, Qin Ming saw his bride, who had lifted her own red veil. A cold silver light flowed around her; she was indeed exceedingly beautiful.

Adorned in a phoenix coronet and embroidered robes, with brows like distant mountains and skin whiter than snow, her dark hair framed a face in red makeup, making her appear like a celestial maiden stepping out of a painting.

Qin Ming immediately realized what the so-called token was: it was the piece of tattered cloth woven from exotic metal that he held in his hand.

The bride stared at him for a long moment, then directly "took" the tattered cloth from his grasp.

Qin Ming had initially resisted letting go, but there was no suspense; how could he possibly contend with her?

The bride only glanced at it for a moment before gasping. She lifted the palanquin curtain and said, "Ninth Uncle, come take a look quickly."

An old man appeared beside them like a ghost, staring at the tattered cloth in her hand. He showed a grave expression and said, "Why is there a small amount of residual sunlight, and some black mist areas? Could it be..."

He opened his eyes wide in shock, an expression of disbelief on his face.

"This isn't a replica; it seems to be the original!" The bride in the phoenix coronet and embroidered robes breathed rapidly, her chest heaving violently. She, too, was profoundly shaken.

*This is it!* Qin Ming thought to himself.

He felt that this tattered cloth, whose origin was unknown, was about to change owners.

If a mere replica could be the token of the First Forbidden Land, how incredible must the original be!

Sure enough, the exceptionally beautiful bride lifted the palanquin curtain and declared, "Take it back for the Old Ancestor to see!"

She lifted her red skirt and, quick as lightning, surged towards the horizon. Ninth Uncle followed closely behind, and then the vast wedding procession.

"Brother Ming, are you alright?" Wu Yaozu quickly ran over.

Before Qin Ming could even speak, at that very moment, a terrifying, heart-palpitating fluctuation emanated from the horizon. The bride and Ninth Uncle actually exploded!

The peerless beauty instantly withered, blood and shattered bones splattering everywhere.

Next, the vast wedding procession. Everyone was enveloped in a blinding light; they seemed to become crystalline and transparent, then disintegrated with a thunderous roar, a truly horrific sight.

In that area, blood rained down from the sky, as everyone simultaneously burst apart. The night mist there was stained crimson.

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu stood frozen like clay and wood sculptures, their bodies growing cold and taut from head to toe. This scene was utterly terrifying.

It was unimaginable how terrifying the person who had acted must be!

What stunned the two of them was that, right near them, a large number of figures reappeared. The red palanquin was completely intact, and the bride lifted the palanquin curtain.

"This... is a re-enactment of past events?" Qin Ming was bewildered.

The bride sighed and said, "It turns out we all died. Every day, we simply repeat the past in this area, forever unable to leave. Today, it's rare for us to be clear-headed for a moment."

She held the tattered cloth, a wistful expression on her face, and a melancholic sadness etched onto her beautiful features.

"Here, take it back!" she said, tossing the exotic-metal woven cloth, which landed in Qin Ming's hand.

Ninth Uncle sighed, "Alas, in the past, the Fourth Forbidden Land was breached. We happened to be passing through here and were just slightly affected, yet we all exploded in an instant!"

"You are..." Wu Yaozu was dumbfounded.

"We are no different from the monsters, phantoms, and illusions that wander this land. We repeat the same actions every day..."

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu understood. This massive wedding procession, including the people they had encountered earlier, like the woman on the paper boat, had almost become strange "phenomena."

They were bound and confined by some power, "patrolling" the outer reaches of the Fourth Forbidden Land.

The bride worried, "The Fourth Forbidden Land is finished. I wonder if my First Forbidden Land will also be 'subdued' and become nourishment for that person."

Regarding the major Forbidden Lands and the powerful beings who sought to devour them, Qin Ming had no desire to get involved. Beings of that level were simply too terrifying.

He only wanted to know the origin of this tattered cloth and couldn't help but ask.

To his surprise, the bride actually answered, "It made a fleeting appearance during the Great Desolation Era."

The tattered cloth was found deep underground in the Misty Night World, a top-tier funerary object in a grand tomb, and was even suspected of being worshipped within the tomb.

No matter how one looked at it, its status was no lower than that of the tomb's owner.

"That tomb owner was at least a quasi-divine being, or even a near-immortal being!" the bride informed him.

Back then, the leader dwelling on the edge of the First Forbidden Land — the bride's Old Ancestor — along with two other individuals of the same rank, entered the tomb.

It was just a piece of tattered cloth, yet it was so highly valued by a being standing at the pinnacle, worshipped even after death within their tomb. Naturally, this aroused the curiosity of the three masters.

They even erupted into a bloody battle over it.

"In the end, the tattered cloth was activated, emitting a dazzling light. It was sent flying out during the battle and was never found again," the bride sighed.

The three masters suspected it might be a fragment of some weapon, or possibly a map. Therefore, they had each replicated multiple copies from memory, observing its patterns, hoping to decipher it.

...

Qin Ming was still dizzy on the road. This tattered cloth had quite an impressive background!

Wu Yaozu said, "Brother Ming, your tattered cloth is very significant. That tomb owner was either a quasi-divine being or a near-immortal being, yet they worshipped this cloth. If you think about it closely, it's a bit chilling!"

"Don't say anything more!" Qin Ming interrupted him, warning him never to bring it up again, to pretend he had never heard of it. He was afraid of causing a major disaster.

"Are we really out completely this time?" Wu Yaozu was lost in thought. After they had passed through the ruins and left the villages and towns behind, the scenery before their eyes changed again. Looking back, the mist-shrouded land was gone.

Qin Ming nodded. He was too familiar with the world enveloped in night mist. They must have left the dwelling place of Wu Yaozu's ancestors and arrived in the outside world.

Wu Yaozu looked at the thick darkness of the night and said, "I never thought the people outside would live worse than me, living in utter darkness. This world is too dim."

He was very disappointed. The Fourth Forbidden Land, at least, had a moon, casting a bright glow over courtyards, like a soft, thin mist, possessing a simple, hazy beauty.

Qin Ming said, "The real world is like this, but it will get better when the shallow night arrives."

Afterward, the two of them hurried a hundred and fifty *li* away in one go, just to get far away from the land behind them!

Wu Yaozu looked at the night sky with a sense of loss, saying, "How melancholic. From now on, I'm far from home."

At this moment, they were traveling through the wilderness.

"We are all wanderers adrift. Alas, may I travel with you?" From a distance, a white-clad woman holding a wine gourd staggered over, clearly intoxicated.

"Sure!" Wu Yaozu immediately nodded.

But soon, he cried out in alarm. The white-clad woman had grabbed his neck, looking as if she wanted to wring it off immediately.

A moment later, the white-clad woman fell dead. At the same time, in the nearby woods, a large fox had its head smashed by Qin Ming's fist.

Clearly, this was a wild fox demon manipulating the human woman to hunt for blood and food.

"Is the outside world this direct? No prelude or 'warm-up', they just go straight for the kill!" Wu Yaozu rubbed his neck. Although the opponent hadn't injured him and he had countered and killed her, it left a psychological shadow on him. In the strange small town, those people would avoid acting unless necessary; they were all incredibly hypocritical.

Undoubtedly, he had adapted to the ways of those Spirit Roamers. Now, encountering such simple and brutal methods upon arriving outside, he felt extremely uncomfortable.

"Go through it a few more times, and you'll get used to it," Qin Ming comforted.

Wu Yaozu was silent, secretly reminding himself not to fall for such tricks again.

However, when he was highly vigilant, problems could also arise.

After walking dozens of *li*, the two finally encountered a small town. Although it was late, there was still a wonton shop open at the town entrance. Qin Ming led him to sit down, planning to eat something.

However, Wu Yaozu darted over, grabbed the boss by his collar, and demanded, "Tell me, are these wontons made with human meat?!"

The boss's face turned pale, revealing a horrified expression: "?"

Qin Ming quickly pulled him away. This brother had become overly paranoid, probably thinking of his grandmother's words, who worried he wouldn't even make it a hundred *li* before becoming dumpling filling in a roadside black shop.

"Are you sick? I'm not doing business with you two!" the boss grumbled, genuinely scared out of his wits just now.

Fortunately, there were other restaurants in town that hadn't closed yet. After Qin Ming led Wu Yaozu to eat their fill, he said, "It's good to be cautious, but there's no need to be overly suspicious of everything. There are still more good people in this world."

Wu Yaozu gave a wry smile. He also knew that he had become a bit too nervous after arriving in the true human world.

They found an inn to stay for the night. After a night's rest, they set off early in the morning, heading for Kunling City, over 1,300 *li* away.

On the road, the scorching sensation throughout Qin Ming's body gradually faded. His eighth rebirth was nearing its end!

Soon after, he stopped, carefully sensing the changes within himself. Besides an improvement in his physique, a new light appeared in his body.

This was the ability born from his eighth rebirth. Qin Ming had already confirmed that this time it was related to divine wisdom.

Subsequently, he began to drink the Heavenly Light Elixir again, performing skill fusion. This concerned the qualitative transformation of his Heavenly Light Energy, which could significantly increase his strength.

First, he circulated the *River Diagram Scripture*. This remarkable art had already been demonstrated in actual combat, and today he could finally push his River Diagram Energy to the Grand Perfection stage.

Mist permeated the air as Qin Ming sat cross-legged in the forest. It was like a fairyland there, with a radiant glow flowing around him, accompanied by white mist that spread outwards.

Next, he took a small sip of Heavenly Light Elixir and began practicing the Purple Palace Thunderflame Art. Instantly, heavenly thunder began to draw forth earthly fire, and lightning and fire illuminated the forest.

During this time, Qin Ming used World-Flame Discernment to ensure he felt no discomfort with these cultivation arts.

However, some energy arts clearly overlapped, such as the Tiger Roar Art and Five Thunders Organ Refinement. He chose the latter because it was a more advanced and powerful art.

Qin Ming took out his bow and arrows and began practicing the cultivation methods from the *Archery Manual*. Although the arrow energy within it didn't sound impressive, it was an absolute art even among major sects!

He had obtained this art from the Silver Great Hedgehog in the Frontier Land.

At this point, Qin Ming's archery skills had reached a terrifying level. He continuously drew his bow, and every arrow found its mark.

He himself felt that his archery was extraordinary, at least master-level, even more powerful than his hammer or spear techniques.

Then, he practiced the Blazing Sun Sword, also obtained from the Frontier Land, from the Quasi-Divine Society. He pushed its Blazing Sun Energy to the Grand Perfection stage.

"With this, I have mastered the saber, hammer, spear, arrow, pike, and sword. I can call myself the Six Absolutes," he muttered with a smile.

Next, he pushed his Combat Physique Energy, Black Roc Energy, Leaping Energy, and Mountain Suppressing Energy all to Grand Perfection.

Afterward, Qin Ming began the skill fusion, with utmost seriousness, constantly performing it in the "Dragon-Tiger Synthesis" method, refining it a thousand times, and finally completing it.

Beside him, Wu Yaozu watched dumbfounded. This brother's entire body glowed, his flesh and blood crystalline. A Great Core appeared in his chest and abdomen, then a human form emerged... similar to what he had seen last time, but with even greater commotion. The entire forest was filled with lightning and thunder.

Long after, Qin Ming rose, his cultivation perfectly complete.

This time, the five unique arts he practiced corresponded to the five elements, and his Heavenly Light Energy underwent a qualitative change!

"Let's go, we should head to Kunling City now," Qin Ming said.

The two did not rush on their journey. Three days later, they successfully arrived at Kunling.

Though called a great city, it had no city walls and was very open. There were many powerful Daoist temples and academies, making city walls unnecessary for defense.

"What a massive city, so prosperous!" Wu Yaozu's eyes weren't enough to take it all in. From far away, he could already feel the bustling crowd.

The wide streets were filled with a constant stream of traffic, not only humans but also various other races. Shops lined both sides of the road, all doing excellent business.

Looking into the distance, there were stretches of ancient architectural complexes within the city, as well as new and bustling commercial streets, and even many mist-shrouded mountain peaks, said to be the locations of various Daoist temples.

Upon entering the city, the two naturally headed towards those Daoist temples and academies.

"The Pure Yang Physique is incredibly powerful! Its conscious spiritual light already carries a hint of Pure Yang attribute. Who can contend with that?"

"I think Ling Yu from Flowing Light City might be even more formidable. He walks both the Path of Rebirth and the Path to Immortality simultaneously, having already challenged a hundred cities with his sword. Now he's in Kunling!"

"Your news is outdated. Someone capable of rivaling them, or even stronger, has arrived! It's said that more than one Immortal Seed and God Seed has come!"

...

As Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu inquired about directions, they heard many people discussing the powerful disciples of the various academies and Daoist temples.
