# Chapter 173: The Forging Gold Hall's Training Area

Just looking at this skin wrapper, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a sense of astonishment, an unconscious thought of feeling inferior rising in his heart.

He immediately cast this notion aside.

What weighed on his mind was that yesterday, this skin wrapper had not displayed such a radiant and dazzling appearance.

Was it because he had defeated it, causing it to absorb the pure yang inner breath from his body?

Otherwise, during today's cultivation of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, the pure yang inner breath hidden deep within his flesh and blood wouldn't have inexplicably diminished.

"If you defeat me, I'll let you go..."

Xu Yunfan mulled over these words, his eyelids drooping.

"I just don't believe it..."

He turned the skin wrapper over, stroking the crack on its spine. When that fairy-like woman had fallen from the Source Ancient Jade Wall, her physical body had gradually dissolved, leaving only this crack.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan's ears twitched. He quickly put away this Extreme Dao Remnant. When he opened the door, he saw Zhan Yan just pushing open the courtyard gate and walking in.

"Master..."

Zhan Yan's expression was slightly pensive as he slowly spoke.

"...I've inquired with Hall Master Mo and found some information. It might not be of much use now, but perhaps you'll encounter it in the future. As for the Extreme Dao's anchor, with the changes in the current world, it's impossible to devour it immediately. It can only remain entangled, progressing step by step, until you can no longer support it. So, you still have a considerable amount of time to prepare."

Hearing that there were some clues, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel his spirits lift. "May I ask, Master, what needs to be prepared?"

"The crystal core of Profound Yin Jade Marrow. Even with the resurgence of the world's spiritual energy, this item is still a rare treasure. It can nourish the physical body, and in turn, prevent the soul from decaying..."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's slightly dumbfounded expression, even Zhan Yan couldn't help but feel a bit awkward. He coughed lightly and said, "Although we are currently in the末法年代 (Age of Dharma Decline), after that old witch gathered the Blood Sacrifice of the Incense Sect, there is finally a trace of spiritual energy scattered in the world. Perhaps you can encounter it."

Xu Yunfan nodded. "Master, I will pay attention to this matter."

"Good, I will make inquiries from various sources. You don't need to worry."

With that, Zhan Yan fell silent for a moment, then changed the subject.

"The Ice Soul Stone on the third daughter of Wang Sheng, the Lord of Red Cloud Manor in Jade Capital Prefecture, can greatly delay the activity of the Extreme Dao's anchor. Perhaps it can suppress it for a considerable period... That girl was born with a deficiency. If not for the Ice Soul Stone suppressing her condition, she would already be soaking in medicinal soup to sustain her life. Even so, her time is running out. If you have the opportunity, you can try to obtain it."

"..."

By the time Zhan Yan left, nearly an hour had passed.

After seeing Zhan Yan off, Xu Yunfan slowly sat down, recalling the methods Zhan Yan had just mentioned.

Find a person who is on the verge of death but not yet dead, and put this Extreme Dao Remnant into them. Perhaps there is a way to get rid of it. However, the precious treasures required for this process are not just rare; in an era rich in spiritual energy, these things might only be considered ordinary. But in this era, if any one of them were to appear, it would be considered a diluted treasure.

After a long while, Xu Yunfan returned to the room and looked at the skin wrapper he had stuffed haphazardly into the bed covers.

After a moment of hesitation, he directly bundled it up and stuffed it into a hidden compartment under the bed.

The Tiangong Cave might lack many things, but it was full of various ingenious mechanisms and traps.

This hidden compartment mechanism was made by his own hands. Unless an outsider had mechanism skills far superior to his, it would be impossible to find.

He stopped thinking about the skin wrapper for now. There was still plenty of time ahead; he would see if this so-called Extreme Dao Remnant could outlast him.

Although he was still thinking about it in his heart, Xu Yunfan understood that this matter wasn't urgent. According to what his Master Zhan Yan had said, if the Extreme Dao Remnant truly wanted to use his physical body to be reborn, there was still a considerable amount of time.

He immediately went out, casually carrying a玄钢矿镐 (Mystic Steel Mining Pick), and rushed towards the underground Forging Gold Hall training area.

Today, he planned to push his Mining skill proficiency to Great Perfection.

He was only a dozen or so points short; it would take just a day's effort.

When he reached nearly three hundred zhang underground, the surrounding temperature had become much hotter. The more than sixty ventilation devices jointly built by the Mechanism Hall and the Tiangong Department were constantly spewing out ground air, transmitting it through this mine hall to various branch mine tunnels.

When Xu Yunfan arrived at the central mine hall, he was already noticed by many bare-chested, muscularly knotted Forging Gold Hall disciples.

Some disciples even walked up to greet him. Xu Yunfan naturally responded with a smile to each of them, then picked up his mining pick and charged into an unoccupied mine tunnel.

Looking at the rugged mine tunnel before him, Xu Yunfan turned on the steam lamp on the mine wall and let out a long breath.

He hadn't expected that after being out for so long, he would end up back in a mine tunnel to train.

Xu Yunfan's shoulder blades suddenly bulged. The Mystic Steel Mining Pick tore through the air with a wolf's howl.

The moment the pick tip struck the red iron ore, his arm muscles contracted sharply into iron balls. Sparks rolled down his tense, high-standing shoulder and neck muscles.

His bare back surfaced with rhomboid鼓 (drum-like) muscles. As his spine undulated, they vaguely seemed to form the shape of a ghost mask.

"Clang!"

The three-hundred-jin red iron ore shattered with a sound.

Fragmented slag splashed onto his sweat-drenched chest muscles, but with a light shake of his skin, the counter-shock force cultivated from the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer directly pulverized these fragments into dust.

Xu Yunfan exhaled like thunder. The muscle groups in his lower back twitched incessantly. Under his bronze-colored skin, blood vessels swelled like coiling dragons. The mining pick in his hand struck down with increasing weight.

The mine tunnel walls shook and iron sand rumbled down. From deep within the branch tunnel, muffled sounds like rolling thunder passed through the winding passages and into the central mine hall, causing many Forging Gold Hall disciples to turn their heads in surprise.

"This force is too great!"

One Forging Gold Hall disciple was dumbfounded. "If Senior Brother Xu's mining pick accidentally landed on someone, they'd definitely be bruised all over."

"Bruised all over?" A disciple beside him, built like a bear, snorted coarsely. "This is the one who easily defeated the head disciple of the Hidden Blade Pavilion, Qi Huan. If that Mystic Steel Mining Pick tip fell on you, your body would probably be split in two."

Seven zhang away,炎雨薇 (Yan Yuwei), who had received news that Xu Yunfan had entered the Forging Gold Hall's territory, rushed into the mine tunnel, her gaze sharp and urgent.

In her opinion, coming to train in such a place was undoubtedly a provocation.

"Big Senior Sister!"

All the Forging Gold Hall disciples shouted in unison.

Yan Yuwei's face was cold and she didn't respond. Her thick arms, bulging with veins, suddenly shot up, tearing off her crimson sash and revealing her bare upper body.

The sound of brocade tearing startled three disciples into dropping their mining picks. Her bronze abdominal muscles, under the firelight, emitted a cold light like the edge of a blade.

Her muscularly bulging figure showed no feminine characteristics at all. What she had was a chest and arms even broader than the other disciples beside her.

Then, under the amazed and awestruck gazes of the disciples, she asked which branch tunnel Xu Yunfan was mining in and walked in.

A long while later, the silent central mine hall had a Forging Gold Hall disciple speak.

"...Big Senior Sister, this is the first time I've seen her like this..."
