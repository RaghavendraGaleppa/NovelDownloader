Chapter 111: True Disciple Liu Xiaosheng, the Great Reincarnation and Transference Method of Rebirth

Outside Dao Peak, a streak of light shot through the air.

Yang Ji quickly arrived at Wuji City via the teleportation array. As soon as he stepped into the main hall of the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance, a young girl invited him to a VIP room. It had to be said that the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance's way of treating guests truly embodied the principle of "guest first" to the fullest, making one feel very comfortable.

Inside the VIP room, Yang Ji was currently sipping Immortal Spirit Tea, waiting leisurely.

Not long after, an exquisite beauty, dressed in a white dress, delicate and tender, walked in gracefully. She sat down elegantly and smiled like an old friend, "Fellow Daoist Yang, are you here again for wood-attributed spiritual items? You've requested them too frequently. Even if our Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance's influence spans across all realms, we can't provide a batch of spiritual items every three to five days."

"Haha, Fellow Daoist Bai, you jest. I'm not here for wood-attributed spiritual items this time. Of course, if you have any, that would be for the best," Yang Ji said with a smile.

"Oh, then what brings you here this time, Fellow Daoist?" Bai Bier poured herself a cup of tea and sipped it, relaxing.

"Does your esteemed Alliance have Time Stones and Space Stones for sale?" Yang Ji paused, pondering before asking.

"Time Stones and Space Stones?" Bai Bier's beautiful eyes lingered on Yang Ji's face, as if trying to discern something.

But Yang Ji remained as still as an old monk in meditation, his expression as calm as an ancient well, without the slightest change.

Bai Bier then said, "Time Stones and Space Stones are rare treasures, enough to forge Supreme Dao Artifacts. They are top-tier materials, as hard to find as Chaos Stones and Life Stones. They're not easy to come by."

"May I ask what Fellow Daoist intends to use them for?" Bai Bier's gaze flickered, seemingly asking on purpose.

Yang Ji smiled, "I want to use Space Stones and Time Stones to forge a Natal Artifact."

"Oh, Fellow Daoist intends to forge a Space-Time Pagoda, a Space-Time Disk, Wings of Space-Time, or a Gate of Space-Time?" Bai Bier asked with a smile.

Yang Ji smiled and shook his head, "The Gate of Space-Time is rumored to be an Origin Treasure, existing only in legend even in the Immortal Realm. How could I possess the method to forge such a treasure?"

"The Space-Time Pagoda and Space-Time Disk are also extremely powerful Immortal King Artifacts. Their forging methods are in the hands of Immortal Kings, not obtainable by anyone outside their direct lineage. How could a minor figure like me reach that level?"

"As for the Wings of Space-Time, they are even more mysterious World-Suppressing Treasures than Immortal King Artifacts. It's said that 'Grand Senior Wings of Space-Time' is an old ancestor of the artifact realm. How could someone like me be appreciated by him and be bestowed with his forging method?"

Yang Ji smiled, "I merely wish to forge a Space-Time Sword."

"Space-Time Sword? I haven't heard of that one before," Bai Bier pondered.

"The Space-Time Sword's upper limit is only a High-Grade Dao Artifact. It originated from a Mahayana expert in ancient times. Given its ancient origins, it's normal that Fellow Daoist Bai hasn't heard of it," Yang Ji explained.

"It seems Fellow Daoist has not only obtained the Demon Emperor's Legacy but also other fortuitous encounters," Bai Bier praised.

Yang Ji didn't deny it, smiling, "What are my small encounters compared to those of True Disciples and Dao Children? Which one of them doesn't possess great fortune and great opportunities? Their experiences are truly enviable. Perhaps some have even obtained an Immortal King's legacy."

"Fellow Daoist speaks true. Daozi Xuanzhong of your Wuji Dao Sect once obtained the legacy of Immortal King Xuanye," Bai Bier said.

Yang Ji was surprised, "Oh, this is the first I've heard of it. It seems Senior Brother Xuanzhong is truly a man of great fortune."

"Indeed. His luck is so profound that he ranks among the top ten in all realms among the younger generation," Bai Bier said with envy.

"Such opportunities cannot be envied. I just want to forge my own Natal Artifact now," Yang Ji said, looking at Bai Bier with a smile.

"To be frank, Fellow Daoist, our merchant alliance does not have Time Stones or Space Stones. However, we can help you keep an eye out for them. If there's any news, we will inform you immediately," Bai Bier slowly said.

"Good, then I thank Fellow Daoist," Yang Ji cupped his fist in a bow, then asked again, "May I ask if your esteemed Alliance has recently received any news about spiritual items that can improve one's bone structure?"

"Not yet, Fellow Daoist might need to wait a bit longer," Bai Bier said apologetically.

"Alright, please do keep a close watch for me. I will surely deliver the pills as promised in the future," Yang Ji thanked her, cupping his fist.

"So confident? Fellow Daoist, you owe our merchant alliance hundreds of millions. If you can't pay, you'll have to sell yourself," Bai Bier looked at him in surprise, teasing with a smile.

"Fellow Daoist, rest assured, there will be no shortage of pills in the future," Yang Ji said, raising his voice slightly with a smile.

"Very well," Bai Bier also smiled and nodded.

After Yang Ji left the merchant alliance, a spatial passage appeared behind her, and an old man walked out. He spoke with interest, "This kid's luck hasn't changed. It's truly fascinating. I vaguely feel that his luck is even more profound than Xuanzhong's. This is my intuition."

A strange light flashed in Bai Bier's beautiful eyes. She said in surprise, "His luck is more profound than Xuanzhong's? Xuanzhong is an Immortal King's inheritor! Old Man Tianji once calculated that among the younger generation in all realms, his luck ranks within the top ten."

"Yang Ji has only obtained some Mahayana opportunities. How can he compare to a monstrous talent like Xuanzhong?"

"What he has obtained is considered rather ordinary, not particularly outstanding. Currently, he indeed only appears to be in the quasi-True Disciple rank."

The old man did not refute, but smiled faintly, "My dear granddaughter, that's just my intuition. I don't know why, but when I look at this kid, I always feel something profound."

Yang Ji left the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance and returned to the sect.

At Dao Peak, he had just sat down in the main hall when he heard the sounds of flutes and strings drifting in, layer upon layer, wave upon wave, ceaseless.

"What's going on? Where are these sounds of zither, lute, and flute coming from?" Buddha Child asked in surprise.

Yang Ji's ears twitched, and he immediately stepped out of the great hall.

In the sky ahead, a colossal chariot was slowly approaching.

Upon the chariot rested a massive, magnificent floating palace. On either side of the palace, boy and girl attendants formed a rainbow bridge, playing flutes and zithers. The music rippled outwards, accompanied by blooming rays of colorful light and auspicious qi, creating a splendid, cloud-like spectacle.

Beneath the chariot, there were actually four colossal Kirin divine beasts.

Those four Kirins were wreathed in flames, majestic in their aura, treading through the air with steady steps. Their large eyes were wide open, seemingly angered, conveying both majesty and dominance.

The aura emanating from each of them was incredibly vast; they were all at the Demon Emperor Realm, which was equivalent to the Void Refinement stage.

Yang Ji was stunned, and Buddha Child was also dumbfounded.

Who was this?

Such a grand display!

Just as the two were wondering, the chariot suddenly stopped in the sky near Dao Peak.

A slender, pale hand reached out and slowly drew aside the curtain of the carriage.

A figure slowly stepped out. This person wore a faint smile, possessing a handsome androgynous appearance, exquisitely delicate. A black flame-like mark between his brows added an extra touch of charming allure.

Upon seeing this person's face, Yang Ji instantly recognized him.

This person was none other than the True Disciple, Liu Xiaosheng.

"Greetings, Senior Brother Liu," Yang Ji immediately bowed.

"Junior Brother, I've come uninvited. I hope you don't mind," Liu Xiaosheng said with a faint smile. Though his appearance was delicate, his voice was exceptionally deep and resonant.

"Senior Brother, you're too kind. Your esteemed presence is an honor for Dao Peak. This junior brother failed to welcome you from afar, so I hope Senior Brother will not take offense," Yang Ji cupped his hands, gesturing, "Senior Brother, please enter the main hall to speak."

"Good," Liu Xiaosheng smiled, seeming very pleased with Yang Ji's attitude. He nodded and confidently walked into the main hall.

Yang Ji instructed the disciples on the peak to attend to the others, then he turned and followed Liu Xiaosheng's footsteps.

Upon entering the great hall, he found that Liu Xiaosheng had settled himself firmly on the main seat, a faint smile on his face, as if he were the master of the place.

Yang Ji's brow subtly furrowed, but he said nothing, smiling as he took a seat in the guest position.

"This kid is really arrogant. Even Daozi Wang Tianli didn't sit in the main seat when he came before. This kid is just a True Disciple, yet his posture is so high. Damn it, this kid probably means trouble," Buddha Child muttered, frowning within the Mountain and Sea World.

Yang Ji had refined the Mountain and Sea World, making it his artifact. He could hear Buddha Child's mumblings without needing a voice transmission.

He thought the same as Buddha Child, but he didn't show it. At this moment, he merely smiled and said, "Senior Brother Liu, what brings you here today?"

"I won't beat around the bush. I've come today because I've taken a liking to you," Liu Xiaosheng said with a faint smile.

"Taken a liking to me? Please enlighten me, Senior Brother," Yang Ji was startled.

"Junior Brother has good opportunities and outstanding talent. I want to take you under my wing. You will definitely have a place in my Rebirth Heavenly Domain," Liu Xiaosheng said straightforwardly.

"I am flattered by Senior Brother's regard, but this junior brother only possesses superior bone structure, and my aptitude is low. How could I be worthy? I absolutely dare not presume to cling to you," Yang Ji said with a look of being overwhelmed by an unexpected favor.

"Master, this kid actually wants you to serve him as master? Doesn't that mean he'd be my Master's master? Damn it, he actually wants to take advantage of me. I, Buddha Child, am unparalleled in this world, bearing the supreme Buddha-Demon Scripture. Sooner or later, I will become an ultimate figure, a True Immortal. How can this kid be worthy of being my Master's master? Bah!" Buddha Child fumed, the first to jump up and rage, cursing within the Mountain and Sea World.

Yang Ji's heart also fell silent.

Serve someone else as master?

A joke!

He, who was determined to achieve immortality, how could he recognize someone else as his master? Wouldn't that be trampling on his aspiration for immortality, essentially stabbing himself in the depths of his soul?

Even if an Immortal King came, he would not entertain such a thought.

Because his ambition was higher than the heavens. An Immortal King was merely a being who had cultivated a few more epochs than him. Given time, he would also be able to reach the Immortal King stage.

He had never considered doing something that would demean his own character.

Others cultivated because they were stuck without a path forward, which led to a desire for reliance.

But his path forward was clear, bright and boundless. He had entered Canglan Sect, obtained the Demon Emperor's Legacy, taken in Buddha Child, acquired the Three Immortals Array, cultivated the Primordial Divine Tree, and gained the method for forging the Wings of Space-Time.

His luck was currently flourishing. If he were to recognize someone else as his master, it would be equivalent to severing a part of his own luck and sharing it with another.

He absolutely would not, and could not, do something that would destroy his path to immortality.

He shook his head internally, refusing.

Liu Xiaosheng saw his expression and smiled faintly, "Junior Brother, I know you are also a person of opportunity, with a bit of pride in your heart. But your opportunities compared to mine are like a firefly next to a bright moon."

"I possess the legacies of three Red Dust Immortals, and I have even obtained the complete orthodox lineage of the ancient Rebirth Sect. My luck is profound, and my foundation is unparalleled."

"If I break through to Void Refinement, I will definitely slay three Dao Tribulations and become an unparalleled Dao Child."

"Following an ultimate figure who is destined to become a Dao Child, and even a Sect Master in the future, will not disgrace your identity. Instead, it will bring you supreme glory."

"If you join my Rebirth Heavenly Domain, I will surely bestow upon you three Low-Grade Dao Artifacts, a Creation Saint Pill that can elevate your bone structure to the supreme grade, and additionally, three divine abilities, as well as an endless supply of Spirit Transformation Pills."

"As long as you kneel down and acknowledge me as your master, your cultivation path from then on will be smooth and unobstructed."

As Liu Xiaosheng spoke with a smile, he subtly employed the arts of [Worship] and [Kingly Path]. These seemed inherent in his charismatic personality; his words naturally evoked faith and loyalty.

It had to be said that Liu Xiaosheng was definitely an extraordinary individual. His slender eyebrows exuded immortal light, his eyes shone like stars. Every movement, every word, was like spring rain silently moistening, displaying his domineering confidence to the fullest, penetrating people's hearts and transcending their spirits.

Sitting in the main seat, with one palm pressed on the Long Life table, he truly exuded the might of a sovereign.

The benefits he promised were extremely tempting; most disciples at the Nascent Soul Realm would be moved.

They would probably kneel down on the spot, bow their heads, and cry out "Venerable Master."

But how could Yang Ji be an ordinary person? He possessed the True Adamant Divine Art, his spirit was upright and unyielding, his heart courageous and fearless, and his Yang Spirit shone like a bright sun, radiating brilliance. How could he be subdued by a mere few words from Liu Xiaosheng?

He was destined to achieve immortality. How could he be tempted by such petty gains?

Besides, he didn't even care for them.

Just as he raised his head to politely refuse, his eyes suddenly contracted sharply, as if he had seen something terrifying.

It was indeed terrifying, for at this moment, he saw terrifying information above Liu Xiaosheng's head: [Outer Realm Celestial Demon, Human Soul, Human Body, Consciousness Reincarnation, Demon Emperor's Heart, Great Reincarnation and Transference Method of Rebirth.]

Great Reincarnation and Transference Method of Rebirth?

This Liu Xiaosheng was actually a human body with a Celestial Demon's heart?

Although he possessed a human spirit and a human body, the memories in his sea of consciousness were of the Demon Emperor's reincarnation. What kind of possession method was this?

No, possession was a soul taking over. His soul was still human; it was just that his memories and thoughts were not human, but belonged to the Demon Emperor.

Such a spell was too heaven-defying. The Demon Emperor's soul did not reincarnate, but its memories and consciousness did, transferring to a human body.

Reincarnated as a human, with a human body and soul, no one would ever detect that he was a Celestial Demon.

Why would this demon join the Wuji Dao Sect?

Yang Ji's heart couldn't help but tremble slightly.

"Hmm? Junior Brother, how is it? What have you decided?" Liu Xiaosheng asked with a faint smile.

"Senior Brother's sudden mention of this matter truly overwhelms this junior brother with unexpected favor. How could this junior brother be worthy of Senior Brother's appreciation? This junior brother still needs some time to prepare mentally before I can give a reply. I hope Senior Brother will not take offense," Yang Ji slowly said.

What a joke!

How could he pledge allegiance to a Celestial Demon?

There was no wall that could keep a secret forever. If the sect discovered that Liu Xiaosheng was a Celestial Demon, and Yang Ji had pledged allegiance to him, wouldn't he be implicated and purged along with him?

The scene of Grand Venerable Muyuan slaying demons was still vivid in his memory; he would not forget it.

Yang Ji immediately shook his head, delaying his reply.

Seeing Yang Ji's hesitant expression, as if about to agree yet still pondering, Liu Xiaosheng smiled and said, "Alright, then in three days, I await Junior Brother's reply. I hope Junior Brother will not disappoint me then."

Yang Ji's heart immediately sank. It seemed Liu Xiaosheng had set his sights on him and was determined to bring him under his command.
