# Chapter 126: The Divine Bloodline! The Immortal Sword Technique!

Li Zhengjing's injuries had mostly healed by now. Only his right arm remained half-regenerated, requiring another ten or so days to fully recover.

The wall-climbing bird had been leaving early and returning late these past few days, up to who-knows-what mischief. Every night, it would gather the Gao clan members, leaving several young men and women pale-faced and utterly exhausted.

Today, however, the bird finally gave them a reprieve—because today was Gao Xuan's burial.

Shi Yuan, who had shared a friendship with Third Master Gao, believed that the opportunity presented by the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven had clouded Gao Xuan's judgment, leading him to turn against his own clan and even attack Li Zhengjing, who had once saved his life.

"Third Master Gao's funeral is now complete," Shi Yuan knelt and kowtowed. "In this battle, the Immortal Venerable diverted the conflict away from Hongshan Town, saving countless lives. On behalf of the townspeople, I offer my deepest gratitude!"

As he spoke, he suddenly remembered something and presented a letter with both hands. "This is news from the capital."

Li Zhengjing opened it and read, his expression turning peculiar.

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official emerged and glanced at the message as well.

"That day in Hongshan Town, when you obtained the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven's opportunity, it drew the attention of many factions. Numerous experts came afterward to investigate."

"All eyes were fixed on the Jiangshang Prefecture, particularly Hongshan Town."

"Meanwhile, the capital quietly accomplished this feat—the world is about to witness the rise of another Human Immortal Emperor."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official sighed. "I suspect that your previous encounters in the capital—the emperor's death, the crown prince's demise, and even your killing of the third prince—were all part of an elaborate ruse..."

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "The Grand Preceptor's schemes run deep."

Though the Debt Master's emergence had drawn widespread attention, all factions remained wary of the Great Zhou Dynasty, keeping their focus on the capital. Even the Ten Thousand Calamities World-Saving Heavenly Venerable had paid a visit!

The capital's initial failure meant the Great Zhou could not produce another Human Immortal Emperor. The imperial family had no choice but to appoint a new emperor.

After this setback, most factions assumed the Great Zhou royal family had exhausted their schemes, diverting their attention instead to the various Heavenly Star Cave Heavens and the hunt for the Debt Master and the Golden Ship of Salvation.

Who could have guessed that the first failure was merely a smokescreen for the second scheme?

"Even my killing of the third prince must have been within the Grand Preceptor's expectations. No wonder he was so generous, letting me take the Dragon Pillar of the Imperial Hall and three hundred spirit mines without protest."

Li Zhengjing mused, "It was all to pave the way for the new emperor... Though, given that he can already wield the Imperial Seal, wouldn't that be enough to stage a coup?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official pondered before replying, "The new emperor, formerly the sixth prince, is the son of the first Grand Preceptor's descendant. In other words, he was always the Grand Preceptor's chosen candidate. Even the crown prince's death might have been part of their plan..."

He paused, then added, "For the current Grand Preceptor to achieve this, I suspect the first Grand Preceptor—who supposedly 'ascended to immortality'—is involved."

Li Zhengjing's eyes gleamed with understanding. "You think he can communicate from the Netherworld to this world, and the current Grand Preceptor's schemes are all his doing?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official nodded. "If the current Grand Preceptor truly had such cunning, he wouldn't have waited until now to act. We now know the first Grand Preceptor still exists in the Netherworld, not truly dead. My guess is that he's the mastermind—though how he communicates with the current Grand Preceptor remains a mystery."

"The Netherworld's Prefect?"

Li Zhengjing frowned. "He resides in the human realm but originates from the Netherworld as a god of the underworld."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official also suspected the hidden Netherworld Prefect might be involved.

But just then, a voice came from outside.

"The Prefect never interferes with the rise and fall of human dynasties."

Silence fell over the room.

Li Zhengjing and the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official exchanged glances, their expressions grave.

In the courtyard outside stood six people—four from the Gao clan and two from the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven.

None were Human Immortals.

"They're only at the Inner Breath realm," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said, puzzled. "How could they hear our conversation?"

With his demonic immortal ears, he could detect movements hundreds of miles away. But how had these two managed it?

"Truly extraordinary talents," Li Zhengjing remarked with a smile. "Invite them in."

Shi Yuan complied, opening the door to admit the two visitors from the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven.

Previously, upon learning that the Gao clan's bloodline carried traces of immortal blood, Li Zhengjing had tasked Shi Yuan with tracing their genealogy. However, the Gao clan's records were under imperial control. As a mere Inner Breath cultivator, Shi Yuan's influence was limited to Hongshan Town—beyond it, his connections were insufficient for such matters.

Anticipating this, Li Zhengjing had also instructed Shi Yuan to send men to where the Raging Monk had been slain, to locate the fake medicine peddler. But the peddler had already departed for the northern wastelands to investigate a fallen Heavenly Star. His followers, however, remained in the area, building temples to spread the Netherworld Prefect's faith.

They had means to contact the peddler, who in turn had sent members of the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven to retrieve the Gao clan.

"It seems the fake medicine peddler is indeed well-informed," Li Zhengjing observed, eyeing the two burly men. "You've confirmed the Gao clan shares your bloodline?"

The leader, with disheveled hair and a vertical scar resembling a third eye on his forehead, replied, "Immortal Venerable Zhengjing, we've verified it. The Gao clan carries our ancestral blood, albeit diluted. They are kin, so we've come to take them back."

He continued, "After investigation, we found that about two hundred years ago, during a migration, many of our clansmen perished along the way. Cross-referencing with the Gao clan's history, it's likely a female clanswoman was rescued and married into the Gao family in Central Province."

"Wait," Li Zhengjing interrupted. "You're not from Central Province?"

Though their attire was Central Province style, their rugged features stood out.

"The envoy said that when in Central Province, we should dress accordingly to avoid drawing attention," the third-eyed man explained. "He also mentioned the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven is leased to you."

With that, he reached into his robe and produced a porcelain vial. His companion, with elongated ears, did the same.

"Is this your blood?"

"Indeed," the third-eyed man said. "The envoy said these two vials are in exchange for the Gao clansmen. If you find it insufficient, you may send someone to the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven. Our clan has over three hundred members—one vial per day would last you a year."

"Deal." Li Zhengjing accepted the vials. "Where did your clan originally reside in the Southern Wastelands?"

"The Great Mist Canyon."

"Why migrate to Central Province?"

"The Prefect decreed the canyon's impending destruction. To preserve our lineage, the envoy's paper crane guided us here."

Li Zhengjing and the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official exchanged glances.

Among the three Heavenly Stars that fell in the Southern Wastelands, one had landed in the Great Mist Canyon, forming a cave heaven. Any creature entering it never returned.

Since the stars' descent, Gao Xuan was the only one to emerge alive from a Heavenly Star Cave Heaven.

"Farewell." The third-eyed man bowed and glanced at his companion, who nodded. Both departed.

Once they were gone, the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official transmitted his thoughts via spiritual energy.

"Truly remarkable talents. Outside Hongshan Town, another of their kin was speaking—likely stationed there as a precaution."

"I heard him with my ears, but the long-eared one heard him too."

"The immortal blood in the Gao clan's veins originates from them. Though diluted over generations, traces of its power remain."

"Their clan's purer bloodline grants them extraordinary abilities."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official added, "When they first arrived, they called themselves the Divine Bloodline of the Emperor."

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin. "The Netherworld Prefect saved their ancestors, relocated them to the Great Mist Canyon, and allowed them to thrive. The name 'Divine Bloodline of the Emperor' must also be his doing."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official's expression grew peculiar, his fingers twitching with curiosity.

Li Zhengjing handed him a vial. "Study this blood first. Out of respect for the fake medicine peddler, let's not entertain thoughts of dissecting those two."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official reluctantly abandoned the idea and accepted the vial.

"One vial isn't enough. Later, write a letter—I'll visit the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven personally to examine them."

He lowered his voice. "Though their bloodline is extraordinary, they're not immune to illness. Since they're leasing the cave heaven from us, we should ensure their health."

Li Zhengjing didn't respond, merely pointing outside. The Divine Bloodline descendants beyond Hongshan Town had heard every word.

Unfazed, the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official rubbed his chin with his draconic left claw. "Still, with such a bloodline, innate talents, and the Netherworld Prefect's protection and teachings, why haven't we heard of any Human Immortals from their clan in the past two to three hundred years?"

He frowned. "In fact, until now, their very existence was unknown."

"The fake medicine peddler relocated them to the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven instead of settling them elsewhere in Central Province. Doesn't that speak volumes?"

Li Zhengjing said, "The Netherworld Prefect clearly kept this divine tribe hidden. That he's revealing them to us now suggests deeper motives."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official understood. "You think their existence is no longer a secret?"

Li Zhengjing nodded. "Though we've leased the cave heaven and have ties with the peddler, that alone wouldn't justify exposing a clan hidden for centuries."

The Gao clan's divine bloodline, inherited matrilineally, was known to the imperial court—and likely to the three immortal sects, two Buddhist orders, and other major factions.

Gao Xuan had killed many of the Gao clan's main lineage, but aside from those in Hongshan Town, some survivors remained. Likely, they'd already been captured by other powers.

The divine nature of the Gao bloodline wouldn't stay hidden for long.

"Initially, I'd hoped to spare Gao Xuan to learn what transpired in the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven," Li Zhengjing sighed. "But he was already at death's door. Even if I'd spared him, the battle's aftermath would have claimed him."

Gao Xuan was a stranger to Li Zhengjing. According to Shi Yuan, he had been a man of principle who revered Li Zhengjing for saving his life before joining the imperial court.

A doubt lingered in Li Zhengjing's mind: Had Gao Xuan been corrupted by the half-severed immortal sword's killing intent? Or had he always been ruthless, slaughtering his clan to preserve his own life by consuming their immortal blood? Or was there another reason?

"What do you think?" the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official asked.

"The half-severed sword's killing intent could amplify bloodlust, but not to the point of complete loss of self," Li Zhengjing replied.

"So it was the latter?" the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official mused. "From what's known of Gao Xuan, he was gentle, especially in his later years, doting on his descendants. He once ventured alone into the Southern Wastelands for a clansman's cure, nearly dying. Such a man seems unlikely to slaughter his kin for self-preservation. Then again, facing death reveals one's true nature."

"I sense this is important," Li Zhengjing murmured, then looked eastward. "We leave for Flaming Pass Mountain tomorrow."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official blinked. "No more rest?"

Li Zhengjing shook his head. "With the Dragon Pillar, the Mirror of Profound Clarity, the Banner of Summoning Heaven, and the Heavenly Star's opportunity—plus my injuries—factions are watching. After my last battle, they're wary, but soon they'll test me. Staying here any longer is pointless."

"Yet you've lingered for days."

"I was waiting for someone. By all accounts, they should have arrived today."

"Who?"

Li Zhengjing spread his hands. "If I said I don't actually know, would you believe me?"

According to the golden book's divination, today he would meet the person he sought. Their identity, gender, or appearance were unspecified—only that through them, he would obtain the Taiyi Sword Refining Technique.

The Great Yan Void-Sundering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi within him hadn't been resolved by obtaining the Mystic White Primordial Gold. On the contrary—because this gold was the blade of an immortal sword, its edge had grown even sharper.

The danger had intensified. Only the Taiyi Sword Refining Technique could fully refine the Mystic White Primordial Gold, resolving the sword qi's flaw and mastering this peerless technique.

No—this was no mere technique. It was an immortal sword art!

"No wonder it took three hundred spirit mines to alter fate," Li Zhengjing murmured. "The Mystic White Primordial Gold is a divine object from beyond this world—a fragment of an immortal's blade. The only method to refine it, the Taiyi Sword Refining Technique, though passed down by the Nine Spirits Immortal Isle, must also be an immortal art."

He closed his eyes. "Throughout history, everyone who practiced the Great Yan Void-Sundering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi was wrong—even Thousand Illusion Divine Lord. Because this sword art was never meant for the mortal realm."
