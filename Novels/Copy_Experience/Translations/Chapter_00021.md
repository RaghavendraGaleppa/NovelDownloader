# Chapter Twenty-One: Darkrock Seal

Seeing the person suddenly appear, Lu Xu's heart slowly sank.

"Did you release that Blackscale Serpent?"

"Hehe!"

Tan Hu chuckled, neither admitting nor denying it. His gaze fixed on Lu Xu, a look of extreme satisfaction on his lips.

"Three years, and I've finally caught my chance!"

"Fellow Daoist Lu, you must know my intentions, right? Please come with me to avoid any unpleasantness if we have to resort to force!"

"What organization are you truly behind?" Lu Xu asked in a low voice.

"You'll know when you get there! Our leader values you highly. Going with us is far better than being a spirit farmer in the Mo family!" Tan Hu was tight-lipped.

"Was the change in the Mo family's patrol routes your doing?" Lu Xu asked again.

"We don't have that kind of ability. Who knows what the Mo family is thinking. Fellow Daoist Lu, you have too many questions. Enough talk, come with me now!"

An impatient expression appeared on Tan Hu's face. This was the Mo family's territory, and he didn't want to linger too long.

Ten days ago, he noticed that the Mo family's patrols in this area had suddenly slackened, becoming almost non-existent after a few days. This sudden change made him ecstatic. He didn't know why such a thing had happened. But he understood that if he didn't seize this opportunity, he would never be able to capture Lu Xu. The amount of spirit stones the other party had obtained from him was enough for them to catch up to his cultivation in ten years. So Tan Hu released a Blackscale Serpent to test whether the Mo family's defenses had truly slackened. The result was that Lu Xu fought with the demonic serpent for half a day, and not a single person from the Mo family was seen. Now Tan Hu was finally certain that the Mo family had indeed given up patrolling this area. This was a godsend opportunity!

"Fellow Daoist Lu, drop your shield. Let me seal your spiritual power. Don't play any tricks. I'll only wait ten breaths. If you don't make a decision within ten breaths, I might accidentally kill you!"

Hearing Tan Hu's words, Lu Xu didn't even consider responding. He simply pulled out a dozen talismans from his embrace. Go with Tan Hu to his mysterious organization? Such a thought had never crossed his mind. He had heard how miserable controlled talisman masters were. Even the Divine Talisman Hall, considered a very conscientious organization, had exploited Old Man Xu to that extent. What a rogue cultivator organization would do, he didn't even dare to imagine.

Seeing Lu Xu's actions, Tan Hu snorted coldly, "You're asking for it!"

A square, earthy-yellow small seal flew out from his sleeve, rapidly expanding against the wind. In a blink of an eye, it became as large as a table, with a hazy yellow light flickering over its surface.

"Boom!"

The massive square smashed down on Lu Xu's head. The water shield enveloping him lasted less than a breath before collapsing with a crash. The square slammed down fiercely but was blocked by a golden light, bouncing away.

"Hmm? A Rank 1 mid-grade Adamant Talisman? Haha, so Fellow Daoist Lu, you've been holding back! You can even make Rank 1 mid-grade talismans now, excellent, excellent!"

Tan Hu became even more excited when he saw the golden light. He pointed a finger, and the aura of the earthy-yellow great seal suddenly intensified several times.

"Bang!"

The massive square smashed onto Lu Xu's head again, and coarse cracks immediately appeared on the surface of the golden light shield.

"Hahahahaha, your Rank 1 mid-grade talisman is unworthy of its name!" Tan Hu burst into laughter at this sight. The shield formed by Lu Xu's Adamant Talisman was not as sturdy as one formed by a true Rank 1 mid-grade Adamant Talisman. Tan Hu immediately understood: Lu Xu's spiritual power was not pure enough. The power of a Rank 1 mid-grade talisman was equivalent to a mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator casting a mid-grade spell once. Talismans required a certain amount of the creator's spiritual power during their creation, and Lu Xu was only at the third layer of Qi Condensation. After entering the mid-stage from the early-stage of Qi Condensation, spiritual power quality would undergo a leap. Lu Xu had not yet experienced this leap, so the quality of his Rank 1 mid-grade talisman was very poor.

"You intend to rely on this to resist me? Surrender quickly, don't force me to go all out!"

Tan Hu shouted, once again commanding the earthy-yellow great seal to smash down.

"Bang!"

The golden light shattered in an instant, but immediately after, another golden light rose, holding back the earthy-yellow great seal. At this moment, Lu Xu had also finally prepared another attack, and the Green Glint Sword swiftly slashed out. The azure stream of light was incredibly swift and powerful. Any early-stage Qi Condensation cultivator facing this slash would surely perish. But his opponent was at the fifth layer of Qi Condensation.

Tan Hu pointed a finger, and the earthy-yellow great seal immediately flew sideways, slamming down fiercely.

"Bang!"

After a crisp collision, the Green Glint Sword was directly bounced away.

"A good magic tool. It can even rival my Darkrock Seal. What a pity it's like a child wielding a sledgehammer in your hands!"

Lu Xu remained silent, activating talisman after talisman in his hands. Four or five massive fireballs flew out consecutively. Tan Hu manipulated the Darkrock Seal to smash down fiercely, completely destroying all the fireballs.

"This person has too many talismans, a bit troublesome!"

"Can't delay any longer!" Tan Hu thought to himself. "Let me show you what a true Adamant Talisman is!"

A talisman flew out from his sleeve, ignited spontaneously in mid-air, and then transformed into a golden shield that enveloped him. A fireball struck the shield, only causing it to tremble slightly, but it could not break through. The Adamant Talisman freed up the Darkrock Seal. Tan Hu manipulated this magic tool and slammed it down towards Lu Xu again.

Lu Xu, as if completely unaware of the massive magic tool smashing down above his head, simply activated talisman after talisman. Seven or eight fireballs flew towards Tan Hu, but this time, something seemed different; a dark green light was mixed within those fireballs. Tan Hu completely disregarded these fireballs, confident that his Adamant Talisman was enough to defend against all of them.

"Boom!"

The Darkrock Seal slammed down first, hitting Lu Xu directly on the head. The golden light shield immediately disintegrated. But immediately, another golden light shield appeared, barely blocking the Darkrock Seal.

Tan Hu, seeing this, was furious: "Let's see how many more talismans you have—"

Before he could finish, the dark green light appeared before Tan Hu. A chill suddenly rose from his spine, shooting up to the crown of his head.

"Not good!"

He let out a loud cry, immediately attempting to recall the Darkrock Seal. But it was too late!

"Puff!"

After a soft sound, a fist-sized ball of dark green flame appeared out of nowhere. The Adamant Shield instantly disintegrated, and the flame directly flew into Tan Hu's body.

"Ah!"

After a brief cry, Tan Hu collapsed to the ground, twitching uncontrollably. The Darkrock Seal fell, and without the support of spiritual power, it reverted to its original miniature seal appearance.

Lu Xu recalled the Green Glint Sword, then fiercely swung it down, beheading Tan Hu. He then stepped forward to pick up the earthy-yellow small seal, quickly rummaged through Tan Hu's body, and took a storage bag. Green flames were erupting from all over Tan Hu's body. Bursts of green fire shot out from his seven orifices, dislodging a bronze mask from his face.

"Hmm? What's this?"

Lu Xu quickly went and picked up the mask. He saw that after losing the mask, Tan Hu's appearance had drastically changed, becoming someone entirely different. Without thinking too much, Lu Xu circulated his spiritual power to disperse Tan Hu's spiritual power imprint on the storage bag, then collected the mask, the Blackscale Serpent's corpse, and everything else inside. He took out a few talismans, altered the terrain, and erased all traces of the battle. He burned Tan Hu's corpse to ashes with a fire.

After everything was dealt with, Lu Xu quickly vanished from the area.
