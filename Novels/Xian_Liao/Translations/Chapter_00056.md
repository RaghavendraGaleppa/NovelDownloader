# Chapter 56: Seventh Grade

"A thousand mountains, no birds in flight;  
Ten thousand paths, no footprints in sight."  

Zhou Qing and Fu Song had been in the mountains for two days. At first, Fu Song could still chat and laugh with Zhou Qing, but now only tension remained.  

The heavy snow had not stopped for two days, covering the peaks in white, resembling ancient ice and snow behemoths from primordial wastelands, towering between heaven and earth, devouring all who dared to intrude.  

Zhou Qing had determined the general direction of the seventh-grade ginseng, but under the heavy snow, the white expanse made every mountain look the same. It was difficult to pinpoint the exact location from the fragmented memories of the ghost fox.  

They had only ventured a few dozen miles into the mountains so far.  

Snowflakes continued to fall endlessly, bending the branches of many large trees under the weight of the snow, some even breaking off and crashing to the ground. The sound of falling branches was particularly startling in the snowy wilderness, echoing across the mountains.  

In such harsh weather, the greatest dangers were venomous snakes and fierce beasts.  

Normally, they would hibernate, but if they emerged in this weather, it meant they lacked sufficient food and were forced to brave the cold to hunt.  

Driven by extreme hunger, their survival instincts made them more ferocious than usual. Even if they encountered natural predators or the dominant creatures of the mountains, they would not retreat.  

Fu Song's ears twitched as the rooster, Morning Sun, suddenly tensed, its stance ready to take flight, its eyes sharp and alert.  

The large bird was covered in snowflakes, resembling a short-necked white crane from a distance.  

Morning Sun suddenly shot into the air like lightning, darting into an ancient tree nearby.  

Zhou Qing focused intently on the rooster's movements.  

He hadn't expected Morning Sun's speed to have improved so much compared to when it was first brought by the blacksmith Hu Tie over two years ago.  

Despite Zhou Qing's relentless efforts, his progress in agility and speed still fell short of Morning Sun's. Especially without the element of surprise, even if he exerted his Shadowless Steps to the fullest, he couldn't catch the rooster in this complex, snow-covered mountain terrain.  

But Morning Sun's obedience to Zhou Qing was ingrained in its bones.  

Soon, the rooster emerged.  

A grayish-white snake struggled weakly under its claws, hissing in futile defiance. It had already been gutted, its gallbladder exposed.  

Nearby was a wooden hut left by hunters who had previously ventured into the mountains.  

Before entering, Zhou Qing and Fu Song gathered some dry branches, shook off the snow, and started a fire inside. They roughly prepared the snake, added some seasoning, and roasted it.  

As he ate, Zhou Qing remarked, "In this weather, normal snakes would be hibernating. For this one to be out hunting means there must be a fierce beast or bird nearby that consumed large amounts of food before winter, leaving this snake starving and forcing it to abandon its instincts to hunt."  

This grayish-white snake was different from ordinary ones. In its death throes, it displayed an indescribable intelligence. Normally, snakes in this weather would remain motionless, conserving energy even if starving.  

Perhaps venomous snakes or beasts that had awakened their intelligence and learned to cultivate were less tolerant of hunger, much like martial artists who expended vast amounts of energy daily.  

Zhou Qing had prepared some fasting pills for the journey, composed of high-calorie, high-protein foods mixed with medicinal herbs—a recipe noted by Fu Shan in the "Herbal Collection" section of the *Spring Return Talisman Manual*.  

The fasting pills tasted terrible.  

Roasted snake meat with seasoning was far more palatable.  

The trip had been somewhat rushed. Given more time, Zhou Qing wanted to refine the fasting pills into fasting elixirs, improving their taste to at least an average level.  

Such improvements would also hone his alchemy skills.  

His current level—Basic Alchemy (Adept)—was still too low. The progress in alchemy was slower than even the Five Viscera Exercises. And this was just basic alchemy. He couldn't imagine how much time it would take to advance to intermediate or higher levels—decades, if not centuries.  

But the greater the difficulty, the greater the potential.  

Fu Song understood Zhou Qing's implication. A beast consuming large amounts of food indicated it had ample winter reserves and was likely massive. Given that they were near the general area of the seventh-grade ginseng, though the exact location remained unclear, the presence of the grayish-white snake forced to hunt in such cold weather suggested the guardian serpent of the ginseng couldn't be far.  

Hope lay ahead.  

The aroma of roasted snake meat drifted from the hut.  

Then, a leopard emerged silently from the nearby forest, approaching the hut's entrance. Zhou Qing and Fu Song both tensed slightly.  

A tiger's roar echoed from within the hut.  

The leopard, light as a cat, pounced toward the hut. Its intense hunger drove it to charge inside for prey, heedless of the fire.  

Fire instilled fear, but hunger overpowered that fear.  

Not just beasts—even humans struggled with starvation.  

Historical records often glossed over such events with a single line: "In years of great famine, people resorted to cannibalism."  

Seemingly understated, these words depicted scenes of hell. Food crises were nearly insurmountable in ancient times. Even during the so-called prosperous reigns of Kangxi and Qianlong, when sweet potatoes and corn were widely cultivated, commoners survived by reducing meals to twice daily and eating coarse, indigestible food.  

Originally, the Han tradition was three meals a day. Under the Qing dynasty, two meals became the norm.  

Moreover, even then, records from Kangxi and Qianlong's eras documented famines where people turned to cannibalism.  

The alchemy room had temporarily become a restricted area in Qingfu Temple, off-limits to all.  

Zhou Qing rested briefly, restoring his spirit through reading and meditation.  

He had already prepared all the ingredients for the Blood Qi Pill in the alchemy room and was thoroughly familiar with the refining process. He trusted his abilities.  

This time, even the seventh-grade ginseng wouldn't pose a problem.  

In truth, Zhou Qing felt it was almost a waste to refine it directly. This wild seventh-grade ginseng was only months away from sprouting an eighth-grade leaf.  

But delays bred trouble.  

The red serpent's lesson was a stark reminder.  

No matter how precious the medicinal herb, it only became truly yours once consumed and digested.  

A few months—or even days—could bring unforeseen changes.  

The temptation of the seventh-grade ginseng was too great.  

If it were the previous Heart-Nourishing Pill, Zhou Qing could have exercised patience, using it to break through the bottleneck from proficiency to mastery in the Ape Exercise.  

But the seventh-grade ginseng was different.  

And that red serpent—it was terrifyingly powerful.  

Neither he nor Fu Song could subdue it.  

If the serpent pursued them out of the mountains, it would spell disaster.  

Was that possible?  

It couldn't be ruled out.  

Zhou Qing calmed his mind.  

Within his *Cultivation Primer*, the progress for Basic Alchemy (Adept) was nearing completion. Successfully refining the seventh-grade ginseng into a Blood Qi Pill should elevate his alchemy to the "Beginner" level.  

Begin!  

However, the red serpent resisted fiercely. Its blood surged, rapidly digesting food. The toxins only slowed it temporarily, soon becoming ineffective.  

Zhou Qing decisively ordered Fu Song to harvest the seventh-grade ginseng.  

Crossbow bolts, hidden weapons, realgar—  

Every means effective against serpents was deployed. Zhou Qing executed his Shadowless Steps flawlessly, denying the serpent any chance to coil around him.  

With Morning Sun's harassment, the serpent was overwhelmed.  

The battle was intense.  

But the serpent seemed inexhaustible.  

Zhou Qing, unusually, began to feel fatigue.  

Fu Song, having previously gathered herbs with Fu Shan, quickly located the seventh-grade ginseng and retrieved it without hesitation.  

But the red serpent noticed.  

It charged madly, enduring countless injuries.  

As Fu Song prepared to leave, a massive tail—thick as an iron rod and weighing a thousand jun—swept toward him.  

*Soaring Dragon in the Sky!*  

Fu Song unleashed a palm strike from the *Eight Trigrams Serpent-Subduing Palm*, instinctively tossing the ginseng bundle to Zhou Qing.  

Zhou Qing caught it without hesitation.  

Fu Song spat blood mid-air, his body flung far back, stopping just short of a cliff. The gap in strength between him and the serpent was vast—a chasm between species.  

Unless he achieved the innate rebirth of body and marrow, he stood no chance against the serpent.  

Without delay, he slid down using a grappling hook.  

But the *Soaring Dragon*'s energy struck the serpent's iron-like tail, causing it pain.  

Instead of pursuing Fu Song, the serpent lunged at Zhou Qing.  

Zhou Qing immediately ran toward the grappling hook, but the serpent's tail sent a barrage of snow-covered rubble flying, blocking his path.  

He had no choice but to flee in another direction.  

The serpent's tail also shattered the grappling hook's claw, sending the rope tumbling down the cliff.  

Zhou Qing leaped off the cliff. Mid-fall, he fired another grappling hook, catching a protruding rock.  

The enraged serpent smashed the hook's claw again.  

But Zhou Qing landed on a ledge he had memorized earlier. With his photographic memory and keen eyesight, he had scanned the cliff's features under the moonlight during the ascent.  

He hadn't planned to act hastily, but the serpent's vigilance far exceeded expectations, as if it could foresee danger.  

Such was life—no matter how much one prepared, surprises were inevitable.  

But one's abilities determined how they adapted to such surprises.  

For better or worse, it hinged on personal capability.  

Zhou Qing hadn't fled blindly. He knew the ledge was there and had the grappling hook as backup.  

Though the serpent destroyed the hook again, Zhou Qing adjusted his stance on the ledge, steadied his breath, and activated his Fire-Rat Robe. With the lightness techniques of Shadowless Steps and *Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist*, along with his formidable arm strength and claw-like grip, he secured the ginseng bundle and descended the cliff.  

The serpent attempted to follow via its usual steep path but had to detour.  

Zhou Qing knew that path—the serpent's route up and down the cliff.  

He had avoided it initially to maintain stealth, as it was too exposed.  

Yet even his alternate approach had alerted the serpent.  

Fortunately, the cliff wasn't too high.  

With tools and their exceptional martial skills, both Zhou Qing and Fu Song ascended easily.  

Fu Song's Eagle Claw technique could pierce stone.  

Using the grappling hook for part of the climb, he descended the cliff with his bare hands.  

The brothers soon reunited and fled hastily.  

The serpent lost them in the complex mountain terrain.  

Morning Sun, with its wings and gliding ability, outpaced them effortlessly.  

They didn't linger in the snow-covered wilderness.  

The leopard, though starved, provided ample meat, fueling Zhou Qing and Fu Song for their mission.

**Qingfu Temple**  

The seventh-grade wild ginseng lay before Zhou Qing. Its fragrance instantly refreshed him, easing his fatigue.  

Seasoned ginseng hunters might spend a lifetime without finding a fifth-grade ginseng, let alone the exceedingly rare sixth-grade.  

Yet here before Zhou Qing was a seventh-grade ginseng.  

If it were to enter the martial world, it would ignite a storm of bloodshed.  

Even unprocessed, this ginseng offered unimaginable benefits to martial artists.  

If the emperor learned of it, imperial enforcers would soon demand its surrender.  

Zhou Qing's status as a provincial top scholar might intimidate commoners and local elites, but in the capital, imperial scholars were a dime a dozen.  

A top scholar was, after all, just a provincial graduate.  

Imperial enforcers, as the emperor's agents, feared no one, not even scholars.  

Zhou Qing decided against returning to Jiangzhou City for now, even instructing Qingfu Temple's disciples to stay put. Though he and Fu Song hadn't disclosed their mission, crowds bred complications.  

The alchemy room became a restricted zone.  

After resting and restoring his spirit through reading, Zhou Qing prepared to refine the ginseng.  

He had all the ingredients for the Blood Qi Pill and knew the process by heart. He was confident.  

Even the seventh-grade ginseng wouldn't thwart him this time.  

Direct refinement felt almost wasteful—the ginseng was months away from an eighth-grade leaf.  

But delays invited disaster.  

The red serpent's lesson was clear: only by consuming the herb could its benefits be secured.  

A few months—or days—could change everything.  

The seventh-grade ginseng's allure was irresistible.  

Unlike the Heart-Nourishing Pill, which could wait, this ginseng couldn't.  

And that red serpent—it was a force unto itself.  

Neither Zhou Qing nor Fu Song could defeat it.  

If it pursued them beyond the mountains, the consequences would be dire.  

Was that possible?  

Entirely.  

Zhou Qing steadied his mind.  

Within his *Cultivation Primer*, Basic Alchemy (Adept) was nearing completion. Success with the seventh-grade ginseng should elevate it to "Beginner."  

Begin!
