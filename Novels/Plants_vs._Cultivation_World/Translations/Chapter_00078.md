# Chapter 78: The Nut

The Qinglu Sect had Pill Peak, Artifact Peak, Talisman Peak, and Formation Peak, but the Spiritual Plants Hall remained merely a hall rather than a peak. The reason was simple—the Qinglu Sect lacked a true lineage of spiritual plant cultivators. Without proper spiritual plant masters, how could they establish a proper Spiritual Plants Peak?

Now, with five officially recognized first-tier spiritual plant cultivators and the addition of Qi Chunde, a third-tier guest elder, the Qinglu Sect was fully capable of establishing a Spiritual Plants Peak.

"Hah, just as I expected!" Shan Yu trembled with excitement upon hearing the news. The establishment of the Spiritual Plants Peak meant Elder Qi would naturally become its first leader. However, as a guest elder, Qi would eventually leave the Qinglu Sect. 

When that time came, the position of peak master would be selected from among the five spiritual plant cultivators. As an inner sect disciple, Shan Yu was virtually guaranteed to become the new peak master. 

As for Gu Mo, who had become a spiritual plant cultivator in just over a month, Shan Yu acknowledged his astonishing comprehension. Yet, Gu Mo's inferior spiritual roots doomed him to struggle in reaching Foundation Establishment. 

Shan Yu was different. With his mid-grade spiritual roots, his chances of reaching Foundation Establishment were at least seventy to eighty percent. Compared to Gu Mo's inferior roots and the other three outer sect disciples with low-grade spiritual roots, Shan Yu held an absolute advantage.

Meanwhile, Song Xing, Li Jinmei, and Mai Yunfa—who had just become spiritual plant cultivators—gathered to discuss how to secure control of the Spiritual Plants Peak. Four of the five spiritual plant cultivators were from the Spiritual Plants Hall. If the future peak master position went to Shan Yu, an outsider, it would be a significant blow to the hall. 

Though Shan Yu had superior spiritual roots and talent, they had numbers on their side. In a competition, they weren't afraid of him.

Gu Mo, however, stayed out of these matters. For him, as long as he could advance to Foundation Establishment, he would directly become a personal disciple of a Golden Core elder. At that point, even if he wanted to relinquish the position of peak master, the sect leader likely wouldn't allow it.

After recording the yield of the Water Spirit Rice, delivering fifty catties to Gou Youyu at the market in exchange for several bottles of spirit wine, Gu Mo immediately resumed his cultivation. 

Previously, his cultivation had stagnated due to focusing on upgrading the Sunflower. Now that he could finally devote himself fully to cultivation, Gu Mo refused to slack off.

One after another, second-tier Sun Essences were absorbed by Gu Mo, transforming into strands of mist-like spiritual energy that expanded the minor celestial cycles within his body.

Suddenly, Gu Mo's body trembled slightly as his fourth minor celestial cycle fully opened. This was followed by the marrow-cleansing and meridian-forging effects of his breakthrough—though this time, the process was slightly different.

Because all of Gu Mo's spiritual energy had now transformed into mist-like energy, the flow surging through his meridians was no longer ordinary spiritual energy but the more condensed, mist-like variant. This extended the marrow-cleansing process to six hours, yet the benefits Gu Mo gained surpassed those of his peers by ninefold instead of the usual sixfold. 

What should have been an enhancement only achievable at late Qi Refinement stage had manifested for Gu Mo at mid-stage. By the time he reached late-stage Qi Refinement, his foundation would be even stronger.

Feeling the surging power within him, Gu Mo once again felt grateful for his earlier decision to prioritize upgrading the Sunflower. Without obtaining mist-like spiritual energy—typically only available at Qi Refinement's peak—during mid-stage, he would never have been able to further strengthen his foundation.

At this rate, Gu Mo wondered if he might be able to contend with early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators by the time he reached Qi Refinement's peak. 

Well, that thought was a bit dangerous. Still, crushing Yuan Niya should be effortless.

With his fourth minor celestial cycle complete, Gu Mo was now a fifth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator beginning to open his fifth cycle. However, having just broken through, he needed time to adjust and familiarize himself with his newfound power—nine times that of his peers.

Coincidentally, during this period, Gu Mo had been using the ten first-tier mid-grade Sunflowers to push back the dark mist near the automatic vending machine. A new breakthrough was imminent.

Carrying ten newly harvested first-tier Sun Essences, Gu Mo entered the dark mist space and approached the vending machine. A fourth icon had now appeared on its surface.

Crushing the ten Sun Essences in his hand, the dark mist around the vending machine receded further, fully revealing the mostly exposed icon. 

As the icon became clear, the fourth type of plant available from the vending machine appeared before Gu Mo.

**Name:** Nut  
**Grade:** First-tier, low-grade  
**Effects:** Sturdy, Self-repair  
**Planting Conditions:** First-tier spiritual field  

"Hmm..."  

After spending fifty Sun Essences to purchase this new plant, Gu Mo stared at the palm-sized round nut in his hand, deep in thought.  

Compared to the Peashooter and Potato Mine, this nut was purely a defensive plant. Of course, the nut was currently in seed form—it wouldn't remain this small. But even if it grew much larger, it could only defend a small area.  

Once planted, the nut couldn't be moved. Gu Mo couldn't wield it as a shield, and enemies could simply bypass the stationary nut to attack him. This was especially true for cultivators who could fly on swords—even if Gu Mo built a wall of nuts, they could easily soar over it.  

"Let's plant it and see."  

Though the nut seemed impractical, Gu Mo decided to test it out. Only through actual experimentation would he know its true value.  

Leaving the dark mist space, Gu Mo found a spot in his spiritual field and planted the nut seed. Almost instantly, the nut expanded at a visible rate. Within moments, a round, yellow nut as tall as Gu Mo stood firmly in the field.  

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*  

Tapping the nut's rough surface produced a hollow sound. Then, Gu Mo extended two fingers, a sharp gleam flashing from their tips.  

Since the nut was a defensive plant, testing its effectiveness naturally involved attacking it.  

*Swoosh!*  

Gu Mo swung his hand, releasing a Minor Golden Metal Sword Qi that slashed into the nut, carving a deep gash nearly two-thirds of the way through. Gu Mo blinked in surprise.  

What shocked him wasn't that he had breached the nut's defense—but that his attack had only penetrated two-thirds of it.  

This nut was merely first-tier low-grade, while Gu Mo was a fifth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator with Minor Golden Metal Sword Qi at the Mastery stage and mist-like spiritual energy. Even without going all out, his attack power rivaled a full-force strike from a seventh-layer Qi Refinement cultivator.  

Yet this first-tier low-grade nut had withstood it. This meant that at its limits, the nut could likely endure a full-power attack from an eighth or ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator.
