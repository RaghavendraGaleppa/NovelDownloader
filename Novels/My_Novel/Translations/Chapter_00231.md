# Chapter 231: Turning the Tables, the Servant Bullies the Master

Li Xian decided to do his best to help Wen Caishang escape danger and repay the kindness of the past. He wanted to settle all debts of gratitude and grievance cleanly and decisively. Seeing that Wen Caishang was being unreasonable, lacking all her usual scheming, and acting like a spoiled, stubborn woman, he wanted to leave for a moment to let her calm down.

Li Xian said, "Alright. I will take my leave first, Madam. Please rest well!" Using the Qingfeng Legs, he leaped over the courtyard wall and left.

Wen Caishang was stunned, finding it hard to believe. "You actually dare to leave?!" she cried out. She watched as Li Xian disappeared into the darkness, remaining dazed for a long time.

Time passed, and the night deepened into utter silence. She could not move at all; her Qi was completely depleted, and her body was covered in injuries.

Inevitably, she felt a secret fear, vaguely hoping for Li Xian's return, promising to obey his every word.

"Fine," she thought bitterly. "He talks about 'finding it hard to accept' and 'not killing innocents,' but that's just an excuse. He's afraid of death and has abandoned me."

"I really regret not ordering the Ancestral Silkworm to bite him earlier. With these injuries, abandoned here, I'm probably doomed."

Lying in the carriage, the more Wen Caishang thought about it, the more hatred and anger filled her heart. She had always been of high status; who dared to defy her? Now, her luck had turned, she had suffered a disaster, and fallen to the bottom.

Without her formidable strength, all sorts of thoughts surged in her heart. She was no different from an ordinary woman. If Li Xian had obeyed her every word, she would have been pleased, but he would have been no different from Pang Long or Qiu Yue. Li Xian's tactic of retreating to advance had infuriated Wen Caishang to the point of wanting to kill him to vent her anger, but this was precisely the key to breaking free from the old framework.

Wen Caishang was furious, cursing him as an ungrateful wretch and hating his disrespect. But the superiority she once held over Li Xian was gone. She thought it over and over, and it was all about Li Xian.

The moon was bright and the stars were sparse; a gentle breeze blew continuously.

Time flowed. The sky gradually brightened when suddenly the sound of hoofbeats was heard from a distance. Wen Caishang woke from a daze, guessing that the pursuers were closing in. She tried to move her body but couldn't budge an inch. Despair washed over her, and she was certain she couldn't escape. She thought, "Even if Li Xian were here, what could he do? Could he help me escape this crisis?"

Just as she was feeling miserable and dejected, the carriage shook slightly. Li Xian had returned, his expression solemn.

Wen Caishang said joyfully, "You didn't leave?" Then she immediately put on a cold face. "Fine! Did you bring those enemies here?!"

Li Xian said, "Madam, I was circling nearby all night and didn't go far. When I saw the pursuers coming at dawn, I rushed back immediately."

Having lost him and then regained him, and seeing Li Xian's words still held respect, the strange annoyance in her heart inexplicably vanished completely. She thought, "I'll make an exception and forgive you this time." She said with a cold face, "Is that true?"

"It's true," Li Xian said with a smile. "How cold-hearted would I have to be to abandon you, Madam? Last night, I was clumsy with my words. I hope you won't blame me, Madam."

"Hmph! What's the use of saying these things now? You've been angering me all night." Wen Caishang's mood fluctuated, and she suddenly felt much brighter, though she still cursed, "You wicked servant."

"If you want to scold me, Madam, you can scold me all you want on the road. For now, please come with me." Li Xian reached out to help Wen Caishang up and carried her on his back. Wen Caishang's beautiful face flushed slightly.

Li Xian had wanted to take Wen Caishang and flee last night, but after arguing with her, he was afraid she would release the Ancestral Silkworm to bite him. So he intentionally acted cold to calm the emotions. However, he didn't expect the pursuers to come so quickly. He ran a few steps out, then suddenly felt that escaping like this would encounter many obstacles. A brilliant plan came to his mind, and he muttered toward the small courtyard, "I'm sorry for borrowing your old horse."

He slipped into the house and knocked out Old Zhang and his children. He led the horse out and slapped its rump.

The old horse, startled, bolted west, creating quite a commotion. Li Xian, carrying Wen Caishang, also ran in the direction of the horse.

Wen Caishang said, "A diversion to the east to attack the west. You've already made a diversion to the east, so why are you still attacking the east?"

Li Xian said, "I suspect that within the Sword Rain Tower, there is a clever person; otherwise, they wouldn't have found us so quickly. A diversion to the east to attack the west can delay them for a moment, but its use is limited. I'm making a diversion to the east to attack the east, thinking one step further. Perhaps it will have a miraculous effect."

Wen Caishang nodded. "You're quite clever." Remembering the argument from last night, she spat out softly, "Wicked servant."

Li Xian smiled, thinking to himself, "The Madam has quite a little temper."

They were still in the city, with many houses along the road. Li Xian ran in the same direction as the horse but slowed his pace, hiding along the way. After traveling about seven or eight miles, a figure descended from the sky.

Su Qiuwu stopped the horse. Seeing no one on it, he knew he had fallen for a trick. "What a cunning brat," he said. "He deliberately let the horse run to attract our attention. He must have run in another direction. Chase after him!"

He immediately turned back, dispatching disciples of the Sword Rain Tower to search in other directions, afraid of delaying and letting the tiger return to the mountains. He never imagined that Li Xian was right nearby.

Li Xian watched Su Qiuwu leave and breathed a slight sigh of relief. He quickly ran out of the city and plunged into the dense forest. Only after putting Wen Caishang down did he get a moment's rest.

Once his strength recovered, he set off again, going deep into the forest and using the trees as cover. At noon, the sun was blazing. Li Xian listened quietly but heard no sound of pursuers. Only then did he find a stream to rest.

He laid Wen Caishang down on the ground. Her white dress was stained with blood, the skirt fluttering, her figure moving. Even though she was in a wretched state and couldn't move, the furrowing and raising of her brows, the pressing and parting of her lips, held an indescribable charm.

Li Xian said, "That was close!"

Wen Caishang was quite appreciative. She thought that many of her own decisions had been plagued by bad luck, always leading to failure, and she had taken one wrong step after another. If Li Xian were to help, using his clever schemes, perhaps she might not be able to escape? But she only let out a soft "Hmph," still sulking.

Li Xian knew they were temporarily out of danger, but they were still in immense peril, with life and death uncertain. Seeing Wen Caishang's sullen face, lacking her usual authority, he suddenly thought: "The Madam has a ruthless nature. I'm risking my life to save her to repay a debt of gratitude, but she might not appreciate it. After this, no matter what, I'll have to leave the One Union Manor. The Madam is rarely in such a窘境, sulking like a little daughter. If I don't tease her a bit, I'll leave feeling stifled."

Seeing that Wen Caishang had closed her eyes to rest, Li Xian became audacious. He plucked some grass from the riverbank and gently tickled her nose. Wen Caishang endured it for a moment before sneezing and saying angrily, "Li Xian! What are you doing!"

Li Xian said, "I'm checking if you're still angry with me."

"Hmph!" Wen Caishang said sarcastically, "Is it worth getting angry over a peasant like you?" In reality, she was half-dead with anger.

Her treatment of Li Xian had always been like using an object. But the feelings from the past were hidden in her heart. Now that Li Xian had turned the tables and showed her no deference, those feelings had quietly changed.

Thus, she showed a more womanly demeanor.

Li Xian said, "So, whatever I do, you won't be angry with me?"

"You..." Wen Caishang said, speaking softly, "How brazen!"

Li Xian lightly brushed her nose tip, annoying Wen Caishang to no end. She cursed in her heart: "If I had known you were this kind of person, I would have劈死 you with one sword!" But she could do nothing about it, sneezing several times, looking extremely狼狈.

Li Xian said with a mischievous smile, "I used to think you were cold and emotionless, Madam. Now it seems, you're no different from an ordinary woman."

"An ordinary woman is not fit to compare with me," Wen Caishang said coldly. "Only now do I know what a brazen brat you are. A small man who has gained power."

"Indeed. Your sulking skill is even more厉害 than an ordinary woman's," Li Xian laughed. "I'm honest and dutiful, not brazen. But you haven't spared the rod on me in the past, Madam."

Wen Caishang said, "Fine! You're holding a grudge for me stabbing you, bringing me to this remote place to get revenge on me, aren't you!"

"You just enjoy yourself now," Wen Caishang said. "Wait until my Qi recovers, and see how I punish you."

Li Xian said, "Madam, you've misunderstood me. I saved you with a sincere heart. My honest nature should be clear to you."

"You've even deceived me. Where is the honesty in that?" Wen Caishang said angrily. "If you mention 'honest' one more time, I... I..." She very much wanted to kick him.

"Alright, alright, I won't mention it," Li Xian said, feeling a bit wronged. Then he smiled again. "If I'm not mistaken, Madam, you've been cursed with a poison, haven't you?"

Wen Caishang was stunned. "How did you know?"

"I guessed," Li Xian said. "Since the day I saw Ma Zhongguang, you've had something off about you. That Ma Zhongguang is a master at using poisons and curses, so I guessed you were cursed. I just didn't expect that the poison worm could completely消散 your Qi."

"It has even... dragged us both into danger."

"Hmph!" Wen Caishang turned her head away. "If you find it dangerous, you can leave. What can I do to you now? I only hate my bitter fate, being schemed against, betrayed, eaten by tigers, and bitten by wolves. It's all destiny."

Li Xian held the grass and tickled her nose again.

Wen Caishang sneezed, her chest heaving with anger, her face flushed red. "Are you done or not!" she shouted.

Li Xian said, "Madam, when you're angry like this, it's actually quite cute."

Wen Caishang said, "You're strange. You're the first person in the world to dare say that the Broken Sword Madam is cute when she's angry."

Li Xian said frankly, "I'm just stating the facts. If it's cute, it's cute. If it's beautiful, it's beautiful. What's wrong with saying that?"

Wen Caishang didn't know whether to be angry or not for a moment and gave Li Xian a white eye.

Li Xian said solemnly, "Madam, the current situation is危及 to both of us. We need to be frank with each other to find a way to survive."

"What do you want to do?" Wen Caishang said.

Li Xian said, "I've already said, be frank with each other. You need to tell me your backup plan." Wen Caishang was furious and憋屈, feeling immensely that Li Xian was riding on her head. "What backup plan do I have? If I had one, would I be bullied by a little servant like you?"

"You do. That silkworm of yours is a very strong backup," Li Xian said.

Wen Caishang said nervously, "What do you want to do?!"

Li Xian said, "I know there is a poisonous silkworm hidden under your clothes. You must also have a Heaven and Earth Treasure Box. Please open the treasure box, Madam, and let the poisonous silkworm crawl into it."

Wen Caishang looked at Li Xian seriously and said coldly, "Are you afraid I'll use the poisonous silkworm to kill you?"

Li Xian remained silent. Wen Caishang narrowed her eyes slightly and sighed. "Li Xian, I really underestimated you. Your strategic thinking is very thorough. I'm afraid that in the past, you were just being deceptive with me, weren't you?"

Li Xian sat beside Wen Caishang, asking her to summon the poisonous silkworm and let it crawl onto his palm. This was equivalent to entrusting his life to her. He said, "The poisonous silkworm is in my hand now. If you want to take my life, you need only a single thought. If the poisonous insect bites, I will die immediately."

"What I am about to say next is all sincere."

"My对待 towards you, Madam, has never been deceptive. But I know that your对待 towards me has mostly been calculated schemes. My heart is innocent, and my feelings for you can be witnessed. But you, Madam... how have you treated me?"

Wen Caishang was startled. She had always demanded how Li Xian should treat her. She had completely ignored how she treated Li Xian. If calculated from the perspective of interests, Li Xian really didn't owe her. Although she had saved him several times, conversely... wasn't it always Li Xian who risked his life to fight for her interests?

She met Li Xian's gaze and for a moment felt a sense of guilt. She had once looked down on Li Xian from above, taking everything for granted. But now, trapped in this danger, that superior stance had completely vanished. Many problems came to the surface.

Wen Caishang said, "You..." feeling an inexplicable emotion. Seeing Li Xian's calm and natural demeanor, treating life and death with indifference, she realized she was inferior to him in this kind of bearing.

For the first time, she felt it.

Li Xian was not her subordinate, nor was he a servant dependent on her.

Upright and proper, he stood before her, his gaze pressing, forcing her to look him in the eye.

"Alright..." Wen Caishang said. "Three inches down my sleeve, there is a Heaven and Earth Treasure Box. Open it."

Li Xian opened the box. The Ancestral Silkworm crawled into it. This action... signified that Wen Caishang's final trump card was being put away.

Under all these factors, she had no more reservations toward Li Xian. Her temperament, her thoughts, her calculations... all of it, just like the Ancestral Silkworm entering the box.

Li Xian closed the treasure box and put it away in his chest.
