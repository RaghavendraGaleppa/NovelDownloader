Chapter 212: The Fourth Xuan Dan, Success! The Wondrous Journey of the Furnace Lid

Midnight was approaching.

Although the fragrance of the elixir had not yet leaked out, the entire small courtyard was illuminated by the firelight of the Dragon and Tiger Elixir Furnace, making the ground shine brilliantly.

Inside the furnace, the young man was entirely wrapped in flames. Suspended before him were two pills.

One was Little Treasure, the Senior Brother. The other was the nascent form of a Xuan Dan, which was currently growing. Six-tenths of its surface had already been inscribed with the meridian patterns of the "Eight Treasures Devouring Metal Art."

It seemed that Little Treasure, the Senior Brother, could freely operate the meridian paths of other martial arts?

Li Mo discovered that while practicing cultivation together with Tang Xiaobao, the nascent Eight Treasures Devouring Metal Xuan Dan was gradually establishing a connection with him. It was indistinguishable from one he had refined himself.

"I'm going to raise the temperature," Xue Lao's voice came from outside.

"Wait."

Li Mo detected a hint of fatigue in his voice, so a faint, clear brilliance appeared behind him. The tranquil and peaceful moonlight illuminated Xue Lao, instantly dispersing his distracting thoughts and calming his emotions. For a moment, only tranquility remained in his heart.

"What kind of Divine Intent does this kid observe?" Xue Jing frowned slightly, but his hands did not stop. A large barrel of Black Evil Wood Oil was poured in, causing the temperature inside the furnace to rise rapidly.

"Phew... Senior Brother Little Treasure, prepare for the final step!"

Even Li Mo felt a wave of scorching heat. The perfected Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body could barely withstand the current temperature of the furnace.

"Here!" Tang Xiaobao trembled slightly and then spun rapidly, spinning so fast he was about to smoke himself.

Heart-Connecting Grass, Nine-Leaf Flower, and thousand-year-old Blood Yellow Essence were thrown in as if they cost nothing, and were rapidly transformed into pure Primordial Qi.

A quarter of an hour later.

The scorching sensation grew increasingly intense. The nascent Xuan Dan, as if gilded, suddenly shone with a brilliant light!

*Boom!*

The Dragon and Tiger Elixir Furnace let out a muffled sound. The furnace lid shot out like a cannonball, trailing a long tail of flame as it flew high into the sky.

"Little Treasure?"

Xue Jing ignored the residual heat and hurriedly stepped forward.

"Mas... Master..."

Tang Xiaobao rolled out, having transformed back into his human form. His tongue lolled out, and his black and white eyes seemed to have turned into vortexes.

"Are you alright?"

"Eh? Master, you seem to have three heads. Did you achieve Three Flowers Gathering at the Top? Hehe..." The dizzy Tang Xiaobao giggled foolishly; he was seeing double.

Xue Jing: "....."

He slapped him.

Tang Xiaobao's eyes cleared.

"Where's Xiao Mo? Why hasn't he come out yet?"

Xue Jing looked into the furnace with a mix of worry and anticipation. This was the crucial moment to verify his theory. If it still failed even under these circumstances, it would mean that the External Elixir Art was nothing but a joke from start to finish.

Inside the furnace, two flashes of golden light, as solid as reality, suddenly appeared but quickly vanished.

"Ah..." Li Mo crawled out of the furnace and sighed, his expression filled with disappointment. "In the end, we still fell short at the last hurdle."

"Failed?" Xue Jing's excited expression froze, and his eyes gradually dimmed. So it was... The External Elixir Art was just a delusion from his youth? Even after doing everything to the extreme, it could only remain in the theoretical stage.

"Xiao Mo, you... don't be too disheartened. The External Elixir Art is inherently against the principles of heaven and earth. Failure is normal. Although we did waste a lot of materials..."

The speed at which the External Elixir Art consumed natural treasures was simply staggering. The single Xuan Dan just now was equivalent to one-fiftieth of Li Mo's entire stock.

Seeing his master with his head bowed in dejection, Tang Xiaobao scratched his head. "Eh? But I clearly saw Li Shidi swallow the Xuan Dan into his stomach?"

Xue Jing's expression froze.

Li Mo spread his hands and laughed, "You believed it just because I said it? Hehe~"

The moment the words fell, Elder Xue's face flushed visibly red on the spot.

"I'm gonna beat the hell out of you, you little brat!"

---

"Just a joke... Look at you, getting angry again..."

And so, two more figures were added to the small courtyard, chasing each other. Li Mo fled! Xue Jing pursued!

It has to be said, with four Xuan Dan inside him, Little Li's True Yuan was endless, and his dodging movements were much faster.

However, the Inner Scene was, after all, the Inner Scene.

After Xue Jing released his Domain, a phantom of the Dragon and Tiger Elixir Furnace pressed down, turning Little Li into a monkey trapped under the Five-Finger Mountain.

Actually, Li Mo could have accelerated further, but that would have cost money. That Eight Treasures Devouring Metal Dan could devour the energy of gold and silver to unleash even greater power.

"You don't learn anything good!"

"Ah? Learn from whom?"

"Of course, from your master. Although she spends money extravagantly, loves to fight, and enjoys drinking, she has her own merits."

"...Like what?"

Xue Jing was momentarily speechless.

Tang Xiaobao, who had been dizzy for a while, had just woken up and was about to clean the Dragon and Tiger Elixir Furnace. He suddenly frowned. "Master, the furnace lid is missing again!"

...

Midnight.

Yulong Street had fallen completely silent. The street was pitch black, the perfect time for no one to be around. A person dressed like a waiter was moving stealthily through the street. If you didn't look closely, you wouldn't even notice someone was there.

"Hmm... No one is following..." Xu Yi was constantly on guard against his surroundings. Only after walking three streets away did he finally let out a sigh of relief.

"So what if they sealed my meridians and Dantian? In the end, I was still one step ahead."

Xu Yi had many identities, so he had learned a wide variety of things. Even though he was now no different from an ordinary person, he could still skillfully undo a tortoise shell bind. Then, by using the Divine Intent he had observed, he could hide his own figure. Finally, he had managed to escape in the middle of the night.

Of course, he wasn't pretending during the day. He was genuinely willing to take Li Mo to the Black Pavilion. However, if he didn't report back to Yin Mianmian on time, she would assume he was dead. At that point, what awaited Li Mo would be a bounty increased tenfold and even more intense targeting from the Drizzle Tower. If something happened to Li Mo, who would he get his money from? So, he planned to go report his mission first, then secretly return to the tavern...

Xu Yi walked down another street. He was just about to take out a "Hall Front Swallow" to leave a signal here when...

*Whoo—*

What sound was that?

Xu Yi turned his head and saw a black object spinning as it flew toward him, getting closer and closer.

What was this thing?

A lid?

*Duang~~*

The sound of his head and the lid making intimate contact was strangely pleasant. After his scalp went numb, Xu Yi's eyes went dark, and he fell straight down on the side of the road.

Not long after, a figure with a cloth strip tied over her eyes and carrying a small basket approached.

"Eh?"

"Isn't this... Isn't this Xu the Second?"

Jiang Chulong, who was about to pick through his belongings, tilted her head in confusion after recognizing Xu Yi. Why was he here? Was he... dead?

She poked Xu Yi's stomach with a peach wood branch. Jiang Chulong felt a bit disappointed. He was still alive. That meant his belongings weren't trash...

"Did... did Brother Li send him out?" Jiang Chulong decided to go back and ask first.

So, she picked up the furnace lid with one hand and grabbed one of Xu Yi's feet with the other, dragging him back to the tavern.

*Bang—*

A muffled sound—the intimate contact of the back of his head with the curb.
