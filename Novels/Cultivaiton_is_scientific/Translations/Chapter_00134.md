# Chapter 134: Cooperation  

With the identity of an intermediate formation master, Li Shimin no longer had to worry about the Yun Trading Company.  

Arriving at Zhong Peak, he checked the time and headed toward a pavilion at the mountain's base. A late-stage Qi Refining cultivator was waiting for him there. Seeing Li Shimin approach, the cultivator stood up with a smile.  

"Congratulations on becoming an intermediate formation master!" Yu Yong'an said warmly.  

This single remark demonstrated Yu Yong'an's extensive network—Li Shimin had only just obtained his new status, yet Yu Yong'an was already aware of it.  

"Brother Yu has quite the information network!" Li Shimin replied with a smile, unsurprised.  

Their acquaintance had begun during Li Shimin's dealings with sea beast carcasses. Yu Yong'an had provided him with many conveniences, purchasing the majority of the carcasses at fair prices without any attempt to undercut him despite the large quantities.  

More importantly, Yu Yong'an's surname, Yu, was the same as that of Yu Gu, the sect leader of Tianhai Hall.  

Yu Yong'an represented the Qianlong Trading Company, one of the higher-tier trading companies within the sect, backed by the sect leader's faction.  

Of course, Sect Leader Yu did not personally oversee the Qianlong Trading Company's operations, nor would he intervene in its affairs. But the mere association with his name smoothed many potential obstacles—even if the sect leader remained silent, others within his faction would step in when needed.  

Li Shimin took out a tea set, brewed some spirit tea, and poured a cup for Yu Yong'an.  

"Junior Brother Li, this tea is excellent. Drinking it makes me feel like I should do something for you in return!" Yu Yong'an joked after taking a sip.  

"I’m here to propose a collaboration," Li Shimin said, cutting to the chase. He placed the "Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0" on the stone table.  

Yu Yong'an showed no surprise at the device—in fact, he knew far more than he let on.  

While the Yun Trading Company had kept the origins of the "Thousand-Mile Vision" a secret, Yu Yong'an, backed by the sect's intelligence network, had long known Li Shimin was its creator.  

"Hmm?" Yu Yong'an quickly noticed the differences in this new version.  

The device on the table was larger and more sophisticated.  

"Junior Brother Li, you’ve improved the 'Thousand-Mile Vision'?" Yu Yong'an's eyes gleamed with anticipation.  

The Qianlong Trading Company never poached business, but it never passed up opportunities to expand, either.

### **"Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0"**  

"This is the 'Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0,' though the name can be changed if needed. It features a larger, clearer display and introduces a group chat function, allowing multiple users to communicate simultaneously. The host can control which participants are visible to others," Li Shimin explained with a smile.  

For someone from his past life, these features were basic. The hardware had been upgraded, and the software could have been updated on the original version.  

But Li Shimin had chosen not to do so—the benefits weren't substantial enough. Had the Yun Trading Company maintained a good relationship with him, he might have considered helping them upgrade.  

Now, however, he sought to settle his Dao Heart by striking back at the Yun Trading Company.  

With his new status as an intermediate formation master, the Yun Trading Company could no longer threaten him. By partnering with the Qianlong Trading Company—which had even stronger backing—he could deliver a heavy blow to his former business partner.  

Yu Yong'an processed the information quickly.  

"Does this mean the 'Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0' can essentially replace an auction house?" he asked, intrigued.  

It wasn’t that he lacked business acumen—it was simply that Li Shimin's concept was so advanced it took him a moment to grasp its full potential.  

"In a way, yes. Each group chat can function as an auction, with the host acting as the auctioneer," Li Shimin clarified.  

"Could the authority to create group chats be restricted to us rather than left open?" Yu Yong'an pressed, his eyes gleaming with ambition.  

"That’s no problem. I can program permissions into the devices you designate," Li Shimin replied, recognizing his intent.  

"Junior Brother Li, unlike the Yun Trading Company, the Qianlong Trading Company won’t take advantage of you given your standing in the sect. I’ll draft a contract, and we can formalize our partnership," Yu Yong'an said earnestly.  

He meant every word. From his father, Sect Leader Yu, he had learned of Li Shimin’s connections.  

Who would have guessed that this seemingly ordinary disciple had a close relationship with Yin Shilan?  

Had the Yun Trading Company known, they wouldn’t have dared provoke him.  

Even without Yin Shilan’s influence, Li Shimin's status as an intermediate formation master alone would have made them regret their actions.

### **The Contract**  

A day later, Li Shimin and Yu Yong'an signed a meticulously detailed contract. After analysis by IBMz15, not a single loophole could be found.  

The terms heavily favored Li Shimin, ensuring his profits while minimizing potential complications.  

Two hundred units of the "Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0" were delivered, priced at 300 spirit stones each—the amount paid to Li Shimin. The Qianlong Trading Company’s resale price was another matter entirely.

### **The Auction**  

Ten days later, the Qianlong Trading Company announced an auction.  

The offerings included high-grade magical artifacts, cultivation aids, a supreme-grade artifact, and—most notably—a Foundation Establishment Pill. The variety of items suggested a grand-scale event.  

Strangely, the auction’s location remained undisclosed. Interested participants were instructed to register with the Qianlong Trading Company.  

Even Li Shimin was intrigued—especially by the Foundation Establishment Pill.  

Every five years, the sect produced a batch of ten to fifteen Foundation Establishment Pills—far from enough to meet demand. Yet, two were always auctioned publicly to placate the disciples.  

The cost was exorbitant for ordinary cultivators, but it at least offered a sliver of hope.  

The Qianlong Trading Company had clearly gone to great lengths to secure this pill—but the investment paid off.  

The entire sect’s Qi Refining cultivators were in a frenzy, and even major factions took notice.  

Two days before the auction, the location was still a mystery. Only the Qianlong Trading Company’s reputation kept participants from suspecting a scam.  

On the eve of the event, each participant paid a 500-spirit-stone deposit and received a "Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0."  

The company assured them that the devices could be returned after the auction to reclaim their deposits—they were not forced purchases.  

The novel auction format excited everyone.  

When the event began, 202 participants joined the group chat—200 bidders, the auctioneer, and Li Shimin (who didn’t need to buy a device, having secured access through his partnership).

### **The New Experience**  

"Esteemed fellow Daoists, this is the most unique auction I’ve ever presided over," the auctioneer began.  

He introduced the "Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0," highlighting its improved display by zooming in on his palm—revealing details the original version couldn’t capture.  

Li Shimin knew the upgrades well: a new "Dragon Core 2.0" chip with enhanced image processing, better LCD technology, and a higher-resolution camera.  

The participants quickly grasped the implications—the Yun Trading Company no longer monopolized the technology.  

"Another key feature is anonymity," the auctioneer continued. "Except for my privileged device, no one in this group will know your true identity."  

This thrilled most participants. Safety and privacy were paramount—bidding from their own secure residences eliminated risks.  

As for false bids? Each device was linked to an identity token. The Qianlong Trading Company knew who was who.  

"The group chat function also allows private discussions among friends, though activation requires our approval," the auctioneer added, promoting the device further.  

With introductions complete, the auction proceeded smoothly.  

Clear visuals and the auctioneer’s commentary gave bidders an immersive experience despite the virtual setting.  

Anonymity and the comfort of their own domains encouraged aggressive bidding. Items sold at high prices, delighting the Qianlong Trading Company.  

Compared to the original "Thousand-Mile Vision," this was a game-changer—one-to-many engagement far surpassed one-to-one.  

Li Shimin waited patiently. His sole target was the Foundation Establishment Pill.  

When the pill finally appeared, the auctioneer held up a jade vial.  

"Every five years, the sect refines Foundation Establishment Pills. This year, fourteen were produced. We’ve been entrusted to auction one."  

Greed filled the eyes of every viewer.  

For non-Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivators, one pill was rarely enough—statistics suggested three were needed for a reasonable chance at success.  

Li Shimin already had one. Securing this would bring him closer to his goal.  

"Starting bid: none."  

Bids flooded in instantly.  

Li Shimin remained calm, observing the competition.  

With ample spirit stones, he was confident—he just needed to gauge the final price.
