# Chapter 33: Fellow Daoist Wang Is My Friend

The morning sun rose.

The fragrance of mid-grade Red Tooth Spirit Rice porridge wafted from the kitchen as Wang Chan swept and trimmed plants in the courtyard. Even though Fellow Daoist Chen had been gone for a month, this routine remained unchanged.

In the neighboring courtyard, Hunchback Zhang seemed to be swinging on a makeshift swing while a female cultivator named Luo Bing coquettishly fed him grapes from a distance—what a shameless pair of lovebirds.

Since becoming a mid-grade spirit planter, Hunchback Zhang's life had grown increasingly carefree. During their previous conversation, he had subtly boasted to Wang Chan that this Luo Bing was none other than the seventh wife of the Li family. However, minor families like the Li clan had already fractured under pressure from external forces.

Seeing that Hunchback Zhang had become a mid-grade spirit planter—a diligent and reliable man willing to work hard—the seventh wife had been coaxed into his arms.

Before long, Wang Chan also began his breakfast in the courtyard.

Spirit rice porridge, braised green lamb, and a side of pickled vegetables—enjoyed with the morning breeze and sunlight—made for a satisfying meal. The mid-grade Red Tooth Spirit Rice porridge was especially delicious, its sweetness particularly pronounced since it was his first time tasting it.

Yet this rice was precious, so Wang Chan had only cooked half a pot. Even with his current appetite, mid-grade spirit rice alone wouldn't satisfy him fully. Still, he had to be frugal.

Next door, the couple was also having breakfast, their sweet nothings creating a syrupy atmosphere. New love was always like this.

In comparison, eating alone felt quiet and somewhat lonely. But on the path of cultivation, solitude was the norm.

Thinking this, Wang Chan couldn't help but retrieve the unfinished bottle of low-grade Peach Blossom Brew from his storage pouch. Since it was valuable, he usually reserved it for special occasions. Roughly three cups remained.

Just as he was about to pour himself a glass to savor slowly—


*Bang! Bang! Bang!*  

Someone hammered on his gate—loudly, rudely.  

Wang Chan frowned, about to ask who it was, when the gate burst open. Even the protective barrier shattered under the force.  

The commotion abruptly silenced the amorous noises from next door.  

Before Wang Chan could rise from his chair, a group of people had already flooded into his courtyard.  

Their leader, a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator with at least sixty strands of spiritual energy, wore black robes. His sharp, predatory gaze gave him the look of a hawk eyeing prey.  

The man strode to Wang Chan's table, glanced at his meal, and smirked condescendingly. "Mid-grade Red Tooth Spirit Rice porridge. Living well, I see."  

"Who are you?" Wang Chan remained seated, a black needle quietly materializing in his sleeve.  

The black-robed man's entourage—six or seven cultivators, four at mid-stage and three at early-stage Qi Refining—burst into mocking laughter. They reeked of lackeys.  

"Black Eagle Gang, He Changkong," the man announced.  

Wang Chan's pulse quickened.  

They had no prior dealings. He certainly hadn't massaged this man's dao companion's jade feet—could they really be here to drag him off to mine spirit stones?  

Even as the thought crossed his mind, three more black needles slipped into his sleeve.  

"What business does Fellow Daoist He have with me?" Wang Chan glanced at his shattered gate, a surge of fury igniting in his chest.  

Had he not used a *Cleansing Talisman* the night before to purify his demonic thoughts, his black needles would have already been flying the moment the gate was kicked in.  

"This porridge isn't bad." Instead of answering, He Changkong pointed at the half-pot of Red Tooth Spirit Rice porridge. Without waiting for permission, he lifted the pot and drank directly from it.  

After a few gulps, he slammed the pot down, picked up a piece of braised lamb, chewed twice, then spat it out in apparent disgust. He then grabbed the unfinished Peach Blossom Brew and drained it in one go.  

"The wine isn't bad either. Peach Blossom Brew, right? Hah..."  

Seemingly satisfied, He Changkong tossed the empty bottle onto the table. Seeing Wang Chan sit motionless throughout, he grinned. "Fellow Daoist Wang, was it? I came early to collect protection fees—two spirit coins."  

"Two is steep. It's always been one per month." Wang Chan took a deep breath, keeping his tone even. "Besides, the Red Leaf Gang already collected at the start of the month."  

"The Red Leaf Gang is dead. This area is under Black Eagle Gang's protection now." He Changkong smirked. "With the chaos outside, we've dispatched cultivators to patrol everywhere. An extra coin isn't unreasonable."  

When Wang Chan stayed silent, He Changkong pressed aggressively, "Fellow Daoist Wang has quite the reputation peddling his medical services at the Black River Market. Surely you can spare two coins?"  

"You flatter me. My meager skills barely put food on the table." Wang Chan suddenly smiled and produced two spirit coins from his sleeve. "But since Fellow Daoist He has come personally, I'd sell my pots and pans to pay up."  

"A wise man knows when to yield." He Changkong pocketed the coins, laughing. "You're a sensible one, Fellow Daoist Wang."  

With that, He Changkong led his gang out, thoroughly pleased.  

Wang Chan's smile remained plastered on his face, but He Changkong's image was now seared into his memory. Glancing at the ruined meal on his table, his grin only widened.  

*Stealing my porridge, eating my meat, and guzzling my treasured Peach Blossom Brew? If I don't make you pay for this, I might as well quit cultivation.*  

But this wasn't the place—too many eyes. That was why he'd held back.  

Moreover, He Changkong was a mid-stage Qi Refiner and reportedly a leader. Without knowing his capabilities, acting rashly would be unwise.  

"Stop right there!"  

Just as Wang Chan sat clenching his fists, plotting how to kill He Changkong, a sharp voice rang out.  

Turning, he saw Beauty Mole—now clad in a white uniform-style soft armor—standing at the gate with four mid-stage Qi Refining guards, two men and two women, blocking He Changkong's exit.  

"Ah, Inspector Tian!" The previously domineering He Changkong instantly adopted a fawning expression, bowing with clasped hands. "Just the other day, I was speaking with—"  

"Collecting protection fees, Fellow Daoist He?" Beauty Mole cut him off.  

"Your insight is peerless, Inspector Tian." He Changkong's eyes darted before he replied obsequiously. "So you know Fellow Daoist Wang? This is all a misunderstanding! I'll return the coins at once—"  

"The Black Eagle Gang aids our inspections to maintain order here. Protection fees are necessary—rules must be upheld." Beauty Mole's gaze turned icy. "But Fellow Daoist Wang is my friend. You kicked down his door, drank his porridge, and finished his wine. Did you think you could just walk away?"
