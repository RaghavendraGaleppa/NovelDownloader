# Chapter 650: The Descent of Qingyuan

A purple-gold lightning radiance exploded within his eyes. He cupped his hands before his chest, and the Divine Sky Refining World Cauldron hovered above his palms. The cauldron's mouth burned with a white flame of wish-fulfillment power, radiating a terrifying devouring force.

"洞冥蚀天，万法归源！摄！" (Devour the Abyss, All Laws Return to Origin! Capture!)

Countless writhing Devouring Heaven Talismans erupted instantly, piercing through the chaotic energy field with pinpoint accuracy. Like billions of invisible straws, they ignored distance and factions, deeply piercing the bodies of the Mid-tier and Low-tier Gods who had been severely wounded in the chaotic battle of the three pantheons, their divine power on the verge of exhaustion or their divine cores already exposed.

Their divine soul origins, shattered divine cores, dissipated and chaotic faith-will power, and even fragments of their souls torn away by the Shadow Domain of the Dark Pantheon—all were forcibly extracted by this irresistible suction. They transformed into rolling torrents that madly poured into the Divine Sky Refining World Cauldron.

The cauldron body trembled violently, emitting a low hum. The white flame inside surged instantly, acting like a precision furnace to forcibly refine and purify the massive, violent, and chaotic energies.

The ninety-first wisp... the ninety-second wisp...

Pure and immortal紫金 (purple-gold) light continuously lit up within the rudimentary Heavenly Cave in Xu Yunfan's Dantian, like stars illuminating the night sky.

When the ninety-third wisp of Immortal Gold Nature was completely formed and merged into the already majestic and vast Profound Void Indestructible Dao Foundation, the Main Gods of the three pantheons finally reacted.

It was this guy who had stirred up chaos in Aetira!

The furious wills of the three Main Gods, like a storm of substantial laws, instantly froze the time and space of the entire battlefield.

Xu Yunfan raised his eyes slightly, but he paid no heed to the anger of the three Main Gods. Instead, he looked up at the firmament. According to Zhang Ziyang, the firmament would soon shatter.

Three attacks, each comparable to the full-force strike of a Golden Core True Lord, locked onto Xu Yunfan from the positions of Heaven, Earth, and Man. There was no way to dodge.

"Ant thief! Shall have your soul forged by divine fire for a billion years!" The decree of the Light Main God rang out across heaven and earth, carrying the supreme majesty of the Heavenly Dao's加持 (blessing).

At this critical moment—

"Rip!!!"

The firmament was torn open like a fragile bolt of silk, a massive rift appearing as chaotic currents surged out.

A majestic figure stepped through the fragments of the shattered world barrier, carrying with it the boundless and vast清气 (pure qi) of the Immortal Palace, descended upon this place.

The man's Daoist robe was slightly worn, a sharp sword slash at the hem particularly eye-catching. However, the清濛道韵 (clear and misty Dao charm) flowing around him was as deep as an abyss, instantly suppressing the wind and snow of the凛冬北原 (Rimewind Northern Plains) to a standstill. Even the torrent of divine power summoned by the three Main Gods was delayed for a moment.

He stood at the pinnacle of the firmament, his gaze like a sword piercing through the karma of myriad worlds, instantly locking onto Xu Yunfan in the center of the chaotic battlefield.

The full-force attacks of the three Main Gods were硬生生承受 (hard-borne) by Qingyuan True Lord, but the sky was covered by the pure qi of the Immortal Palace,消弭 (dispelling) these attacks.

随后 (Then), a plain voice pierced through all the noisy roars, clearly imprinting itself into Xu Yunfan's ear.

"Xu Yunfan, oh Xu Yunfan,"

The voice of Qingyuan Miaodao Chengyun Xuanqiong True Lord betrayed no joy or anger, yet it made the hair on Xu Yunfan's body stand on end.

"You have made me search for you well."

Xu Yunfan's heart trembled violently, his divine thought flashing like lightning.

The moment the terrifying fluctuation of Qingyuan True Lord breaking through the realm arrived, the last trace of hesitation in his eyes completely vanished.

"Explode!"

A cold command was issued in his sea of consciousness instantly.

"Pfft!"

"Argh!"

"No!"

At the edge of the battlefield, Locke, Buthus, and Anya—three Upper Gods deeply branded with the Devouring Abyss Restriction in their soul cores by Xu Yunfan while fighting against the gods of the Light and Dark Pantheons—shuddered violently simultaneously.

The eternal ice crystal divine armor covering Locke's body cracked inch by inch. Buthus's divine body,凝聚 (condensed) from pure storm, instantly溃散 (dissipated) into chaotic flows.

On the surface of Anya's crystal-clear寒冰神格 (Frost Divine Core), which emitted a dormant aura, dense, writhing Devouring Heaven Talismans, like spider webs, suddenly appeared.

There was no earth-shattering explosion, only a silent annihilation as the divine core core was forcibly detonated from within.

Three wisp of Immortal Gold Nature representing the origin of their respective authorities, along with their shattered souls,消融 (melted away) instantly like残雪 (residual snow) thrown into boiling oil.

Only three mournful cries of souls at their极致 (extreme), their seized divine authority forcibly剥离 (stripped away), returned to the Aetira Heavenly Dao.

Immediately after, three strands of immense and refined Immortal Gold Nature origin, under the牵引 (guidance) of the Divine Sky Refining World Cauldron, instantly没入 (merged into) Xu Yunfan's Dantian,融入 (fused into) the ninety-three boiling purple-gold divine dragons.

Three Upper Gods, each possessing three wisp of Immortal Gold Nature. Even if three wisp were wasted, this was enough to refine ninety-nine wisp of Immortal Gold Nature.

But in this situation, where was there time to carefully refine them?

He needed to achieve his goal through quantity.

The more Immortal Gold Nature, the better!

The three Main Gods and Qingyuan True Lord were mutually wary of each other, so they definitely wouldn't attack immediately for the time being; they would probe instead.

This time gap was his opportunity.

Furthermore, he wasn't incapable of retreating. He could simply假持金位 (falsely hold the Golden Position).

In this Great World, incredibly far from the Taihua Spirit Ruin World, the power of Qingyuan True Lord's Dao Fruit would消弭 (diminish) by more than half.

It was an opportunity!

Seeing Xu Yunfan showing no regard whatsoever, the three Main Gods were enraged, and heaven and earth lost their color at their anger.

Three of their subordinates had been instantly抹杀 (erased) right before their eyes.

The fury of the Nature Main God instantly ignited to its peak.

"Alien Demon! The maggot stealing the Dao!"

The roar of the Main God Orian卷起 (rolled up) a gale-like wind capable of destroying the world, instantly shredding the clouds for ten thousand miles.

"Blasphemous thief! Shall be eternally镇压 (suppressed) in the Abyss of Frost!"

The意志 (will) of the Main God Ymir froze heaven and earth, even the dissipated divine power turning into ice crystals and falling.

The decree of the Light Main God Solar transformed into golden flames that burned everything.

"Strip his soul! Burn his魄 (lower soul)! Forge him in divine fire for ten thousand generations!"

The three terrifying wills of Main God level, the moment Xu Yunfan detonated the restriction, were彻底勾连回溯 (thoroughly linked and traced back) with the Heavenly Dao of this world.

The层层迭迭 (layer upon layer) of karma mist, the cognitive deflection布下 (laid) by the Devouring Heaven Talisman, in the face of the Main God will fully supported by the Aetira Heavenly Dao, were like薄纱 (thin gauze) scattered by a strong wind.

Xu Yunfan's figure, along with his暗中挑动神战 (secretly instigating divine wars),收割神灵 (harvesting gods), and引爆下属 (detonating subordinates), were clearly映照 (reflected) in the vision of the three Main Gods.

Invisible pressure descended like three ancient divine mountains.

Although they were wary of the suddenly appearing Qingyuan True Lord and did not attack immediately, merely压下 (pressing down) with the status of Main Gods combined with the status of this world's Heavenly Dao, it was enough to爆杀 (blow up and kill) an ordinary Foundation Establishment perfection cultivator on the spot.

But who was Xu Yunfan right now?

The bones over his body爆响 (exploded with cracks), the rudimentary Heavenly Cave supported by the ninety-three wisp of Gold Nature in his Dantian trembled violently, the chaotic airflow at its edge almost崩散 (shattering).

Xu Yunfan, however, showed no trace of fear. He even advanced instead of retreating, his Star Banner in hand covering the sun.

"Rise!!"

Under the terrifying pressure capable of crushing a Great True Person at Foundation Establishment perfection, Xu Yunfan did not shrink back. Instead, he let out a sharp cry that seemed to tear his throat.

His sleeves鼓荡 (billowed), and a dark light shone brilliantly.

Seventy-nine banner spirits of different shapes and forms charged out of the banner surface with roars.

The周天星斗大阵 (Celestial Starry Array)展开 (unfolded) instantly.

Brilliant star trajectories强行撑开 (forcibly pried open) a domain amidst the chaotic and violent divine power storm. Although it swayed violently under the冲击 (impact) of the three Main Gods' wills, its light flickering, it硬生生顶住 (hard-borne) the first wave of destructive pressure.

On the banner surface, the star points representing Upper Gods like Buthus and Locke flickered madly, passively汲取 (absorbing) the divine power that ran wild and dissipated due to their陨落 (fall) on the battlefield to nourish the array,勉强维持 (barely maintaining) the formation from collapsing.
