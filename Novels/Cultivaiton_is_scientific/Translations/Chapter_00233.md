# Chapter 233: Request

On a mountain peak near the Ten Thousand Swords Peak, Li Yuanba was setting up an array formation.

This peak had been requested from his master, Elder Jian. Many of the peaks surrounding the Ten Thousand Swords Peak belonged to Elder Jian, but since he had no disciples and didn't cultivate spiritual plants, most of them lay abandoned.

When Li Yuanba asked Elder Jian for a mountaintop for personal use, the elder agreed without hesitation.

This wasn't a significant matter, and Elder Jian had no intention of prying into his disciple's secrets.

At Elder Jian's level of cultivation, his focus was solely on accumulating resources in preparation for breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage.

Elder Jian firmly believed there was no cultivation technique superior to the "Sword Intent Soaring to the Heavens Art." Throughout his life, he had remained devoted to his flying sword, practicing the most powerful technique. Even while wandering abroad within the demonic sects, he remained a pure swordsman at heart.

His needs for material possessions were minimal—any resources he obtained were used to strengthen his flying sword.

Having secured the mountain peak, Li Yuanba began his preparations. Like Elder Jian, he didn't cultivate spiritual plants to develop the Shuiyun Peak.

Shuiyun Peak had a pleasant environment, with a waterfall cascading from the mountainside to form a pool at its base. Unfortunately, the spiritual vein here was only upper-grade; otherwise, it would have made an excellent cave dwelling.

His purpose here was singular—to cultivate the "Purple Qi from the East" technique. His main cave dwelling remained on the Ten Thousand Swords Peak, which boasted a Golden Core-level spiritual vein. The abundant spiritual energy and sword intent there greatly aided his cultivation of the "Sword Intent Soaring to the Heavens Art."

After setting up the array formations on Shuiyun Peak, his daily routine became fixed.

Every two days, he would take a top-grade "Shushan Primordial Chaos Pill." Combined with his innate spiritual root talent and the spiritual energy from his cave dwelling, his cultivation speed was no slower than that of his original body, Li Shiming, whose physique had been enhanced by a year of "Purple Qi from the East" cultivation.

The speed of his "Sword Intent Soaring to the Heavens Art" cultivation increased severalfold, especially after taking the top-grade "Shushan Primordial Chaos Pill"—each session was equivalent to twenty regular cultivation sessions.

Every morning at dawn, he would go to Shuiyun Peak to absorb the purple qi at sunrise using 1,500 Fresnel reflectors.

Additionally, he had retrieved the Golden Core formation resources given by Elder Lu, who had also taken back his token.

When he requested the Golden Core formation resources, he received the necessary spiritual herbs for four types of pills—Meridian Protection Pill, Spirit Stabilizing Pill, Rebirth Pill, and Mountain-Breaking Pill—along with a jade slip containing the Senluo Sect's knowledge and secret techniques related to Golden Core formation.

The reason for providing the ingredients rather than the pills was that all four required third-grade spiritual herbs as main ingredients, necessitating the involvement of a Pill Master for their refinement.

However, the Senluo Sect's Pill Masters rarely took on such tasks anymore. It was said they were attempting to break through to the Nascent Soul stage and had been in seclusion for over a decade.

With no new Pill Masters yet trained, the failure rate of high-level alchemists attempting to refine third-grade spiritual herbs was so high that few cultivators were willing to commission them.

This didn't mean there were no alternatives—one could seek out Pill Masters from other factions. However, such arrangements couldn't be made through official sect channels and required individual cultivators to handle them personally.

Li Yuanba wasn't particularly concerned. In fact, he preferred receiving the raw ingredients.

Given the situation with his original body, by the time he reached late Foundation Establishment stage, Li Shiming would likely have become a Pill Master himself.

Li Yuanba's situation had stabilized. Although the Senluo Sect still had minor conflicts with orthodox sects and unresolved issues with the Thousand Leaves Temple, conflicts between major sects in the cultivation world were never short-term affairs.

Disputes between major sects could last for many years, giving cultivators ample time to focus on their cultivation.

At the Shushan Sect, after mastering the refinement of the "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills," Li Shiming began mass-producing them.

Unlike the "Shushan Primordial Chaos Pills," the "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills" used five types of second-grade spiritual herbs in their formula, limiting their production volume.

Fortunately, years of accumulated reserves existed. Previously, the sect's four high-level alchemists couldn't simultaneously refine ten furnaces of pills—this required not only spiritual sense but also immense mental strength and, most crucially, talent.

The four high-level alchemists could barely guarantee success for each furnace they refined. They were far from matching Li Shiming's ability to handle ten furnaces simultaneously—a feat typically associated with Pill Masters.

Thus, over the years, the sect had accumulated substantial reserves of the five second-grade spiritual herbs used in "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills." The annual yield couldn't be fully processed by the high-level alchemists, leading to growing stockpiles.

But Li Shiming's involvement changed this situation dramatically.

Each time he refined ten furnaces of "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills," they were all high-grade, and through the use of the "Hundred to One Pill Division Technique," the output doubled the standard yield.

Of course, Li Shiming couldn't reveal his ability to achieve a 100% success rate with the "Hundred to One Pill Division Technique." If this capability were exposed, he feared it would bring significant trouble.

Firstly, it would be impossible to explain—especially to Elder Ma, who had extensive knowledge of the technique. Without revealing his computer space, no explanation would convince Elder Ma.

Secondly, if his perfect success rate became known, he might be confined by the sect and forced to do nothing but refine pills endlessly.

Being coerced into refining pills was entirely different from doing so willingly.

Thus, although he consistently used the "Hundred to One Pill Division Technique" to refine "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills," he kept all the extra pills for himself.

Resources for mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators were extremely valuable—more so than spirit stones. When exchanging for spiritual materials, high-grade "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills" were far more desirable than spirit stones.

Li Shiming maintained a pace of five refining sessions per day, accumulating ten top-grade "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills" daily for himself.

Unfortunately, this prosperous period didn't last long. After about thirty days, he had exhausted all the sect's accumulated "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill" materials. Years of stockpiles couldn't keep up with his rapid refining pace.

This demonstrated the importance of a powerful alchemist to a sect. In just over thirty days, he had refined 1,600 bottles of high-grade "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills" for the sect—while storing an equal amount in his computer space.

Additionally, he had 324 top-grade "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills." By his estimates, these would sustain his cultivation for a year. In the entire cultivation world, there likely wasn't another mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator who could consume a top-grade pill daily.

Many informed cultivators within the sect were astonished by his alchemical achievements. Fortunately, Elder Ma shielded him from external scrutiny, allowing him to refine pills and cultivate in peace.

"Junior Brother!" One day, just as Li Shiming finished his "Purple Qi from the East" cultivation session and was about to practice his two body-refining techniques, he received word that Senior Sister Ye Jingxian and his two senior brothers were visiting.

"Senior Sister, Second Brother, Third Brother!" He opened the formation and welcomed the three into his cave's main hall before asking curiously, "Senior Sister, weren't you in seclusion? What brings you here?"

"After hearing my junior brother became a high-level alchemist with skills surpassing the sect's other high-level alchemists, and knowing what my 'seclusion' really entails, I came to ask for your help with something!" Senior Sister Ye said straightforwardly.

"Senior Sister, please speak freely!" Li Shiming replied with a smile.

"It's not for me—it's for these two." She pointed to Second Brother Wan Zheng and Third Brother Lu Shi beside her.

"If my senior brothers need something, they could have come directly. No need to trouble you, Senior Sister!" Li Shiming shook his head with a smile as he looked at his two senior brothers.

Senior Sister and the two brothers exchanged glances, sharing a knowing smile.

Originally, as fellow disciples under Elder Su, their relationships had naturally developed over time, growing closer with each passing day.

Senior Sister Ye and the two brothers were typical examples. Apart from formal visits to their master during sect gatherings, they rarely interacted otherwise.

But Li Shiming's rapid progress—now a high-level alchemist capable of consistently producing high-grade second-grade pills—compelled them to strengthen their ties with him.

This visit served dual purposes: the two brothers needed pills refined, but it also provided an opportunity to reconnect and strengthen their relationship with Li Shiming.

Senior Sister Ye, though technically in seclusion, still kept abreast of external affairs.

When her two junior brothers approached her about Li Shiming's situation, it led to this joint visit.

"Junior Brother, here's a pill formula. Could you assess whether you can refine it and estimate the likely quality and success rate?" Second Brother Wan Zheng handed Li Shiming a formula.

Li Shiming examined it—a complex formula requiring seven second-grade and over fifty first-grade spiritual herbs, more intricate than the "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills" but still within his capabilities.

The formula included detailed refinement methods. With his experience from over 1,600 furnaces of second-grade pill refinement—though this was a new formula—he could confidently predict the outcome.

No other high-level alchemist could observe the refinement process at a micrometer level. This unique perspective made each of his sessions equivalent to ten or even a hundred sessions for others.

Having successfully refined various pills before, he felt confident about the "Azure Glaze Five Elements Pill."

"An excellent pill. I can refine it with about an 80% chance of high-grade quality," Li Shiming replied after consideration.

Hearing this, Wan Zheng and Lu Shi visibly brightened.

The "Azure Glaze Five Elements Pill" was a cultivation aid usable by mid-to-late Foundation Establishment cultivators. After obtaining the formula, they had been collecting the required herbs.

Having used the sect's standard pills for years, their bodies had developed resistance, diminishing the pills' effectiveness.

This wasn't unique to them—most mid-to-late Foundation Establishment cultivators sought alternative formulas and commissioned high-level alchemists. Typically, after one or two years of using a particular pill, its efficacy would decline, necessitating a change.

As for asking their master Elder Su to request Elder Ma's assistance in pill refinement—unless it involved life-or-death situations or critical breakthroughs—Elder Su would hesitate to impose on Elder Ma.

Although Elder Su and Elder Ma were old friends, at the Golden Core level, accumulating favors was something to be avoided when possible.

"Junior Brother, here are the ingredients. We'd appreciate your help!" Wan Zheng placed a storage bag before Li Shiming, both brothers cupping their hands respectfully.

"You're too kind, Senior Brothers. Let me check the ingredients first." Li Shiming's spiritual sense entered the storage bag, finding the herbs well-preserved. He nodded approvingly.

The quantity was substantial—enough for fifty batches.

"Junior Brother, we wouldn't want to break alchemist conventions. The compensation will follow standard rates," Wan Zheng added.

This was Li Shiming's first private commission outside sect assignments. He felt somewhat awkward discussing payment, especially with his own senior brothers.

"Junior Brother, don't stand on ceremony. They're fortunate to have direct access to you—many sect members who've tried to commission you have been turned away by Elder Ma, who claims you're still in the learning phase. If you undercharge, Elder Ma would reprimand you, and other alchemists would resent you," Senior Sister Ye explained, recognizing his discomfort.

Wan Zheng, Lu Shi, and Senior Sister Ye herself all preferred that Li Shiming not work for free—doing so would make future requests awkward.

Given Li Shiming's alchemical talent, his eventual ascension to Pill Master status seemed inevitable. Having ready access to a future Pill Master's services far outweighed the benefits of a few free refinements.

They were sensible enough not to sacrifice greater long-term advantages for minor immediate gains.

"Since Senior Sister says so, I accept," Li Shiming finally agreed with a nod.

Although they had expected his compliance, Wan Zheng and Lu Shi couldn't hide their delight.

Li Shiming hadn't interacted much with the sect's mid-to-late Foundation Establishment cultivators, so he was unaware of their current sentiments.

Upon learning of the new high-level alchemist, many had been excited, anticipating expanded options for pill refinement.

As batches of high-grade "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills" entered the sect's warehouses—an unavoidable disclosure—they realized this new alchemist was producing large quantities of high-grade pills without fail.

This left most mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators, who had already built up tolerance to "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills," regretting their past choices. The efficacy of high-grade pills far surpassed that of mid- or low-grade versions.

Consequently, the sect revised the contribution points required for high-grade "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills," with each batch bearing Li Shiming's unique mark.
