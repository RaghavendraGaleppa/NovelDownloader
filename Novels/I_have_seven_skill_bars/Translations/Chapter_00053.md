**Chapter 53: Earth Qi Art Cultivated!**

In fact, there was also a conflicting relationship between the [Golden Radiance Spear] and [Weed Removal] skills. The [Golden Radiance Spear] utilized Metal attribute true essence, which happened to counter the Wood attribute true essence of [Weed Removal]. However, these two skills were cast using different hands, so there was less mutual interference.

In contrast, both [Condensing Yang] and [Rainfall] skills had to be cast using both hands. Water attribute true essence needed to flow simultaneously from both hands, and Fire attribute true essence likewise needed to flow from both hands simultaneously. The moment these two streams of true essence came into contact, they would immediately generate a fierce repulsion. Although this repulsive force wasn't uncontrollable, managing it would undoubtedly require a significant amount of time and energy, much more difficult than overcoming the Pest-Weed Kill skill before.

Despite the help of the skill slots, Ding Rui's speed in developing inertial memory remained extremely slow. If Ding Rui continued to simultaneously cast both [Condensing Yang] and [Rainfall] skills with both hands, while it was entirely possible to fuse the two skills, cultivating inertial memory in this state would undoubtedly take even more time. Therefore, Ding Rui thought of a solution: to change the casting habits of the [Rainfall] skill and the [Condensing Yang] skill.

"Finally..."

He was so excited he could barely calm down. From the start of cultivating his first art, the *Golden Radiance Art*, until now, nearly two years had passed. The spiritual fields had been harvested three times, he had fused two skills, and he had even personally experienced a battle with an evil cultivator, though he was only responsible for getting beaten and falling unconscious.

But heaven rewards the diligent. On this day, he had finally cultivated all five cultivation arts!

Ding Rui suppressed his excitement and placed the [Earth Qi Art] skill into the last empty skill slot. The seven skill slots were once again filled.

The five cultivation art skills – [Golden Radiance Art], [Rain Dew Art], [Azure Wood Art], [Condensing Yang Art], [Earth Qi Art] – each represented one of the five elemental arts. The two work skills – [Pest-Weed Kill] and [Icefire Palm] – covered four spiritual field tasks: weed removal, pest killing, rainfall, and promoting photosynthesis.

Logically, Ding Rui still needed to add a [Soil Loosening] skill to be fully responsible for the production and management of a spiritual field. However, his skill slots were already insufficient. Even if soil loosening, weed removal, and pest killing all targeted a single spiritual rice plant, he could completely fuse these three skills together.

"If only there was a way to directly contact Matthew... like a mobile phone, or at least a regular phone," Ding Rui thought as he walked towards the logistics department. "But that's just wishful thinking. If something like a mobile phone or telephone truly existed, its significance to this cultivation world would be unimaginable, and it would undoubtedly be used directly on the battlefield, just like saddles and stirrups."

Entering the logistics department, the outer sect disciples there were already very familiar with Ding Rui. They smiled at him, then suddenly their eyes widened in surprise, exclaiming, "This is your fifth time here! The previous four times were all for cultivating an art. Could it be this time too...?"

"Hehe," Ding Rui chuckled. "Yes, Senior Brother, I've cultivated another art. My fifth art, the *Earth Qi Art*."

As he spoke, Ding Rui extended his hand in front of him. With a thought, Earth attribute true essence flowed from the acupoints near his spleen, through his meridians, and into his palm, where a faint brown glow immediately emerged.
