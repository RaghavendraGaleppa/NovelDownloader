**Chapter 92: The Treasure Vault of Ten Thousand Gods**  

**First Void Heaven – Ascension Staircase**  

A large group of outer court disciples from the three great Dao Academies had gathered at the Ascension Staircase.  

After a long wait—  

*Whoosh—*  

“He’s finally stopped moving!” The man who had been trying to compile a ranking of outer court geniuses let out a sigh of relief, though his thoughts remained unsettled.  

Unconsciously, he glanced once more at the Spiritual Essence Ranking.  

**[614: Zhang Jing (Qi Refinement Tenth Layer - 24th Stair - Dragon Lake Dao Academy)]**  

The label “Qi Refinement Tenth Layer” stood out starkly.  

The twenty-fourth step of the Ascension Staircase meant that Zhang Jing had reached the **Third Void Heaven**.  

In contrast, even the proud prodigy of their own Divine Thunder Outer Court, Senior Sister Qin Nian, had only reached the sixteenth step.  

The gap between them was staggering!  

*Where on earth did Dragon Lake Dao Academy dig up such a monster?*  

And with someone like him around—  

*Was there even any point in compiling an outer court genius ranking anymore?*  

With this thought, he quietly tucked away the recording spirit jade in his hand and turned to Shen Qingqing with a hint of reverence in his eyes.  

“Shen Fairy, what exactly is this senior brother’s background?”  

At this moment, Shen Qingqing seemed to snap out of a daze, her eyes still filled with disbelief.  

*What did reaching the twenty-fourth step of the Ascension Staircase even mean?!*  

Looking across all outer court disciples of the three great Dao Academies—no, wait!  

Shen Qingqing suddenly realized something and stared blankly at the Spiritual Essence Ranking, where an inner court senior brother from the Mystic Radiance Dao Academy was ranked just above Zhang Jing.  

*This monster couldn’t even be counted among the outer court disciples anymore!*  

His competition had already shifted to the inner court elites!  

At that moment, certain thoughts quietly extinguished in Shen Qingqing’s heart.  

*The gap was too vast—there was no point.*  

“Shen Fairy?” the man called again.  

“Oh, Senior Brother Zhang? He’s the next chief disciple of our Dragon Lake Dao Academy’s Thousand Techniques Pavilion!”  

Chen Xiandao, standing nearby, answered proudly, puffing out his chest.  

He looked as though he basked in the reflected glory.  

“Next chief disciple of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion? What kind of nonsense is that?”  

The man who had asked the question, along with everyone else, looked utterly baffled.  

This was the first time they’d heard such an outrageous claim.  

*Was it even possible for someone at the Qi Refinement stage to be designated as the next chief of an inner court pavilion?*  

Yet judging by the expressions of the Dragon Lake Dao Academy disciples—  

*It seemed to be true!*  

---  

**Outside the Void Heavens**  

Gazing at the familiar name now frozen at the 614th spot on the Spiritual Essence Ranking, even the bearded pavilion master—who had witnessed countless prodigies and freaks—couldn’t help but freeze in shock.  

An inexplicable sense of absurdity rose in his heart.  

*The situation wasn’t unfolding as expected.*  

Or rather—  

Both he and You Yuanming had underestimated Zhang Jing’s talent in the Dao of True Techniques.  

Reaching such heights on his first attempt at the Ascension Staircase meant that his **Nether Python Devours the Void** Dao Rhyme was already nearing perfection.  

And Zhang Jing had only been cultivating the high-grade cultivation method for just over a year.  

*If that was the case…*  

For the first time, the bearded pavilion master felt a flicker of doubt.  

*Was there even any need to persuade Zhang Jing to switch to the Dao of Formation Runes?*  

“Ah well, let’s see how things develop. What if the kid fails to comprehend the Dao Intent in the end?” he consoled himself inwardly.  

Meanwhile—  

“Brother, how about transferring that little monster Zhang Jing to our Spirit Dao Pavilion instead?”  

Having also noticed Zhang Jing’s ranking on the Spiritual Essence Ranking, the red-faced elder turned to the bearded pavilion master with a sheepish grin, testing the waters.  

What the Thousand Techniques Pavilion master had realized, the red-faced elder had also figured out.  

And at this moment—  

*He was sorely tempted.*  

If this little monster joined the Spirit Dao Pavilion, then the next chief disciple would still be able to rank on the **True Spirit Ranking**—what an honor that would be!  

---  

*Whoosh—*  

A biting wind, carrying needle-like ice particles, lashed against Zhang Jing’s face with a metallic *clink-clink*, as if hammering iron.  

In an instant, his eyebrows and hair were frosted white.  

While climbing the Ascension Staircase, he hadn’t noticed much.  

But now that he had descended—  

Zhang Jing realized just how harsh the environment of the **Third Void Heaven** was compared to the first and second.  

The bone-piercing cold seeped through his robes, chilling him to the core.  

Fortunately, the skill trait **[Body Like a Python]** from the **Ocean-Conquering Python Devours the Void True Method** had granted Zhang Jing a monstrously resilient physique akin to a flood dragon.  

Otherwise, this relentless cold alone would have been unbearable.  

And yet—  

Zhang Jing looked around.  

All he saw was a vast expanse of snow, desolate and devoid of life!  

*Troublesome, troublesome! Hunting spirit beasts for spiritual essence first requires actually finding them!*  

His head throbbed with frustration.  

Everything before his eyes told him one thing—  

*Acquiring spiritual essence by slaying spirit beasts in the Third Void Heaven might prove exceedingly difficult.*  

Zhang Jing lowered his gaze unconsciously.  

A Dao pattern flickered in his palm.  

**[Spiritual Essence: 7,310]**  

---  

Having climbed all this way, he had gradually discerned a pattern.  

As the steps of the Ascension Staircase grew higher, the spiritual essence obtained from defeating guardian spirit deities increased exponentially—especially at the thresholds between Void Heavens.  

For example—  

Defeating an ordinary guardian spirit deity in the **First Void Heaven** yielded **10 spiritual essence**.  

By the **Second Void Heaven**, it became **200 spiritual essence**.  

And in the **Third Void Heaven**, it skyrocketed to a staggering **1,000 spiritual essence**!  

Zhang Jing recalled Senior Brother You’s advice once more.  

Forget the various opportunities in the higher Void Heavens—just the sheer difference in spiritual essence acquisition was already astronomical.  

The **Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven** only remained open for a year.  

*The implications were obvious.*  

Zhang Jing glanced at the Spiritual Essence Ranking.  

**[1: Qiu Han (61st Stair - Late Foundation Establishment - Divine Thunder Dao Academy)]**  
**[2: You Yuanming (61st Stair - Late Foundation Establishment - Dragon Lake Dao Academy)]**  

The moment he saw this—  

His expression froze.  

That Senior Brother You ranked near the top of the Spiritual Essence Ranking didn’t surprise Zhang Jing.  

But—  

*The Seventh Void Heaven?!*  

*This progress was absurdly fast!*  

His gaze drifted downward, finally settling on the Mystic Radiance inner court disciple ranked just above him.  

Despite both being at the Foundation Establishment stage, there was a staggering gap of **thirty steps** between them—nearly four Void Heavens apart!  

*“Is this the terror of a superior Dao Foundation?”*  

A flash of awe passed through Zhang Jing’s eyes.  

Snapping out of his thoughts—  

With a thought—  

**10 spiritual essence** silently vanished.  

---  

**Within a Mysterious Space**  

“So this is the **Treasure Vault of Ten Thousand Gods**?” Zhang Jing muttered curiously as he surveyed his surroundings.  

The space was shrouded in gray mist.  

Only two doors stood silently before him.  

The door on the left bore a large seal-script character for **“Treasure.”**  

The one on the right was inscribed with the character for **“Dao.”**  

Without hesitation, Zhang Jing strode toward the right door.  

“You again?”  

Behind the door, Zhang Jing stared in surprise at the infant floating in midair before him.  

*Wasn’t this the same giant cloud infant who had announced the rules of the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven?*  

Though its size and color had changed, its appearance was unmistakable.  

The infant, however, seemed entirely unbothered by Zhang Jing’s reaction.  

Crossing its tiny arms, it glared at him indignantly.  

“He is him, I am me! Ugh, whatever—I, the great Infant Lord, won’t stoop to arguing with a brat like you.”  

“Kid, which cultivation method do you practice? What Dao Intent are you seeking?”  

Hearing the Infant Lord’s childish, milky voice—  

A strange look flickered in Zhang Jing’s eyes.  

But he quickly realized—  

*Despite its appearance, this being was connected to the ancient Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven. Its manner of speaking wasn’t all that odd.*  

“May I ask, honored—”  

Zhang Jing hesitated.  

“Call me **Infant Lord**!” the infant snapped impatiently.  

“Infant Lord, I cultivate the **Ocean-Conquering Python Devours the Void True Method**. I seek to comprehend the **Lunar Python Dao Intent**.”  

Zhang Jing clasped his hands respectfully.  

After just a few exchanges—  

He noticed that despite the Infant Lord’s lofty tone, it still behaved like a child.  

*Flattery might be the best approach.*  

Sure enough—  

Sensing Zhang Jing’s deference—  

The Infant Lord’s eyes crinkled into a pleased smile.  

“You’re not bad. The Infant Lord approves of you! Seeking the Lunar Python Dao Intent, eh? That’s unlimited access—**1,000 spiritual essence for three breaths of comprehension**.”  

*Three breaths?! 1,000 spiritual essence?!*  

Zhang Jing’s eyes widened.  

His expression practically screamed—  

*Are you kidding me?!*  

“Don’t look at me like that! These are the rules set by the higher-ups. I can’t do anything about it.”  

The Infant Lord shrugged helplessly.  

“Too expensive. I can’t afford it right now. Infant Lord, I’ll take my leave for now!”  

Without another word, Zhang Jing turned and strode away decisively.  

“Young man, do visit again~ Oh, and if you find comprehension too difficult, consider exchanging for a **Wisdom Bodhi Fruit** next door. Only **5,000 spiritual essence**!”  

The Infant Lord’s cheerful, enthusiastic voice followed him.  

“Thank you for the suggestion, Infant Lord.”  

Zhang Jing responded politely, though his footsteps quickened.  

Though he currently had over **7,000 spiritual essence**—enough for **21 breaths** of Lunar Python Dao Intent comprehension if he pushed it—  

He wasn’t confident he could grasp anything meaningful in such a short time.  

As for the Infant Lord’s suggestion of exchanging for a Bodhi Fruit—  

Zhang Jing found it unappealing.  

After spending **5,000 spiritual essence**, he’d be left with only **2,000**.  

*What would be the point of comprehension then?*  

*If he accumulated more spiritual essence in the future, he might reconsider.*  

Besides—  

Zhang Jing ‘gazed’ into his sea of consciousness.  

A hazy, chaotic spiritual light curled in a corner, emitting a faint glow that carried an unfathomable Dao aura.  

A sense of calm settled over him.  

*The **Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light** would fully recover in about seven days.*  

*He could return then to comprehend the Lunar Python Dao Intent.*  

---  

As for these seven days—  

*He would focus entirely on hunting spirit beasts, accumulating as much spiritual essence as possible!*  

After exiting the right door—  

Zhang Jing turned and entered the **“Treasure”** door without hesitation.  

It cost **10 spiritual essence** to enter the Treasure Vault of Ten Thousand Gods once.  

*If he didn’t familiarize himself with everything inside, it’d be a waste!*  

His vision blurred momentarily before clearing.  

An infant identical to the Infant Lord appeared before him.  

“Tsk, a little brat from the Third Void Heaven.”  

The infant studied Zhang Jing with a mocking tone, its voice sharp.  

Realization dawned on Zhang Jing.  

*This was another entity of the same kind.*  

“May I ask how I should address you?”  

He maintained the same respectful demeanor.  

“Heh, little one, I’m not as foolish as that oaf next door. Flattery won’t work on me. You may call me **Young Lord**.”  

The self-proclaimed Young Lord smirked at Zhang Jing.  

“Well? What do you wish to exchange for?”  

Before Zhang Jing could answer, the infant waved a chubby hand.  

A translucent scroll unfurled before his eyes.  

Zhang Jing focused on the contents.  

**[300-Year Crimson Sunroot: 2 spiritual essence per stalk.]**  
**[Primordial Water Essence: 1 spiritual essence per qian.]**  

*“So cheap!”*  

Zhang Jing couldn’t help but marvel at the items listed at the top.  

Treasures that the outer court regarded as priceless were practically being sold for peanuts here.  

*This must be the legendary ‘Upper Realm’s’ resource support for the Dao Academies.*  

Zhang Jing pondered.  

After all, these items couldn’t be used within the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven anyway.  

His gaze traveled further down.  

**[Bodhi Fruit: Upon consumption, enter a state of Dao comprehension for 100 breaths. 5,000 spiritual essence per fruit.]**  
**[Dao-Enlightenment Tea: Leaves contain traces of the Great Dao. Upon drinking, the mind becomes pure as an infant, attuned to heaven and earth. 10,000 spiritual essence per qian.]**  
**[River of Time Gold Sand: A single grain contains three years of time. Can be used for cultivation and Dao comprehension. 180,000 spiritual essence per grain.]**  
**[Three Calamities Gale Banner: Top-grade treasure spirit embryo, imprinted with the aura of the sentient treasure ‘Ten Suns Wind Calamity Heaven-Soaring Banner.’ Contains minor Gale Dao Restrictions and minor Crimson Sun Dao Restrictions. When waved, it scorches the earth for a thousand li, unleashing boundless might. 3,000,000 spiritual essence.]**  

The array of miraculous treasures left Zhang Jing dazzled.  

Especially the **River of Time Gold Sand**!  

*He could see a path to rapidly leveling up his skills.*  

But—  

*Poverty aside—*  

The bigger issue was that only a handful of items—such as the Bodhi Fruit—were available for exchange.  

The rest, including the coveted River of Time Gold Sand, were marked as **“Ineligible.”**  

“Young Lord, may I ask what ‘ineligible’ means?” Zhang Jing inquired.  

“Heh, different Void Heavens grant different exchange privileges. Hah, why are you even looking at those things? Could you afford them anyway?”  

The Young Lord sneered before suddenly recalling something.  

With a tap of its chubby finger—  

The scroll shimmered, and most of its contents vanished.  

“There. Now you won’t have any ‘problems,’ right?”  

Zhang Jing’s eye twitched, but he pressed on.  

“Young Lord, which Void Heaven must one reach to exchange for the River of Time Gold Sand?”  

“The **Seventh Void Heaven**,” came the blunt reply.
