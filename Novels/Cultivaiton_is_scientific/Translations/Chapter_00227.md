# Chapter 227: Slaying the Demon

Li Yuanba received the purple jade slip and the shrunken corpse-refining coffin. The coffin was a special third-grade spiritual artifact—a tool for refining corpses rather than a magic treasure.  

Yet its value wasn't any less than that of a magic treasure. Crafted from third-grade materials, its aura alone confirmed its worth.  

"The wealth of a major sect's Golden Core elder is truly staggering—casually handing out a third-grade spiritual artifact!" he remarked with admiration. Regardless, the coffin alone was more than enough to trade for the Jade Foot Relic.  

He then probed the purple jade slip with his spiritual sense and discovered it wasn't something hastily prepared. Instead, it was a complete legacy, likely the original jade slip of some faction. The wear of time on it was unmistakable and impossible to fake.  

The contents of the jade slip weren't encrypted or locked behind any trials—he could access everything freely.  

"Elder Lü, this is the legacy I obtained." After storing the jade slip and coffin, he tossed the Jade Foot Relic over.  

Elder Lü was pleasantly surprised. He had expected Li Yuanba to pull some trick, but the young man had handed over the relic without hesitation.  

Still cautious, Elder Lü summoned an Iron Corpse—one of his many refined corpses, though not particularly strong, it was at the late-stage Iron Corpse level. With it guarding him, he could handle any unexpected threats.  

Once prepared, he extended his divine sense into the Jade Foot Relic.  

His body stiffened abruptly as his consciousness was forcibly sucked into the relic, subjected to its trial.  

The Jade Foot Relic was a secret inheritance of the Thousand Leaves Temple. Few outside the temple's highest echelons knew its true nature—even among its own disciples, knowledge was scarce.  

Li Yuanba had anticipated Elder Lü would inspect the relic. He knew exactly what it entailed.  

Since Elder Lü had gone to such lengths—venturing into the Foundation Establishment battlefield at great risk—he wouldn't accept the relic without verifying its authenticity.  

The moment Elder Lü's consciousness was drawn into the relic, Li Yuanba summoned Jiang Chen.  

Jiang Chen lunged at the Iron Corpse, which instinctively moved to intercept despite its orders to protect Elder Lü.  

Though Jiang Chen was stronger, Elder Lü's Iron Corpse had been specially trained. While its offense paled in comparison, its defense was on par.  

Jiang Chen's attacks carried sword intent—a rare trait for an Iron Corpse—but they barely left a mark on Elder Lü's refined corpse.  

---  

Li Yuanba fired a sword beam at Elder Lü.  

Just as it was about to strike, Elder Lü's body dodged instinctively, narrowly avoiding the attack.  

This was another of Elder Lü's abilities—when his consciousness was incapacitated, a primal combat instinct took over to protect him.  

Every Golden Core cultivator was extraordinary, each with unique experiences and life-saving techniques.  

Sword beams rained down, but Elder Lü kept evading, rendering each attack futile.  

Li Yuanba gritted his teeth in frustration. Even in this state, he couldn't land a hit on Elder Lü.  

He dared not engage in close combat. Against a true Golden Core elder—even one suppressing his cultivation—a single strike from that mid-Golden Core physique would either kill him or leave him severely wounded.  

Moreover, he couldn't guarantee Elder Lü wouldn't unleash his full power if pushed too far.  

If that happened, while the righteous Golden Core cultivators would eventually swarm Elder Lü, Li Yuanba wouldn't live to see it.  

With his combat instincts activated, Elder Lü didn't remain passive. Lacking higher reasoning, he targeted the nearest threat—Jiang Chen.  

Without using any magic treasures, Elder Lü charged and struck with a palm.  

Jiang Chen, having just repelled the Iron Corpse, met the attack head-on.  

Their palms collided, and both staggered back, neither gaining an advantage.  

The Iron Corpse rejoined the fray, and now outnumbered, Jiang Chen was forced onto the defensive, taking hits from both opponents.  

Li Yuanba realized Elder Lü in this state couldn't even channel spiritual energy—he was fighting purely with his formidable Golden Core physique.  

Otherwise, no matter how strong Jiang Chen's defenses were, he wouldn't withstand a casual strike from a mid-Golden Core cultivator.  

Anxiety gnawed at Li Yuanba. He didn't know how long the Jade Foot Relic could trap Elder Lü. The elder wasn't some weak Foundation Establishment cultivator—his spirit was many times stronger than Li Yuanba's or his true body, Li Shiming's.  

He ordered Jiang Chen to retreat while fighting, drawing the battle away.  

Suddenly, Elder Lü's combat instincts locked onto something nearby. He punched out, shattering a formation of nine array flags.  

A startled ghostly wisp fluttered up but was obliterated by the residual force, along with a small square box that shattered into pieces.  

---  

The ghostly wisp was a split soul from the *Soul Control Division Technique*, deployed by Li Shiming to divert Elder Lü's attention. The small box was a monitoring device.  

Both had been observing Elder Lü, ensuring he sensed their presence.  

Li Shiming had prepared multiple contingencies—this was just one of them. His plan was to use the ghostly wisp as bait while he observed the enemy through the device.  

He hadn't expected his target to be a Golden Core elder. Fortunately, Elder Lü's consciousness was trapped in the relic, buying him a slim opportunity.  

Li Shiming was hidden nearby, concealed in the shadow of a boulder using the *Phantom Concealment Technique*—a newly acquired stealth method. Its effectiveness allowed him to set up this ambush.  

The moment Elder Lü destroyed the ghostly wisp and the device, Li Shiming's stealth broke. The *Top-Grade Magical Artifact Electromagnetic Cannon* appeared in his hands. No aiming was needed—the bait had served its purpose.  

Unlike during his Qi Refining days, his understanding of formations had deepened. The lightning-generating array he'd set up was far superior, doubling the output.  

After prolonged accumulation, it had reached the formation's limit.  

The third-grade sword foundation serving as the cannon's projectile had also grown stronger with Li Shiming's progress—especially his body-refining, which had surpassed Foundation Establishment limits. Among Foundation Establishment artifacts, it was unmatched.  

Thus, the sword foundation's power had multiplied since his Qi Refining days.  

Though the cannon itself hadn't been upgraded, the enhanced electricity and projectile made it incomparably more lethal.  

Li Shiming's appearance, summoning the cannon, and firing were nearly instantaneous.  

A blinding flash erupted as the sword foundation shot toward Elder Lü.  

Elder Lü, having just shattered the formation and destroyed the ghostly wisp, hadn't even retracted his palm when the projectile struck.  

He didn't dodge—couldn't dodge. The attack was too fast.  

To Li Shiming's relief, Elder Lü didn't unleash Golden Core power in response.  

This wasn't Elder Lü's combat instinct's fault—it had underestimated the cannon's threat.  

As a seasoned mid-Golden Core cultivator, he wouldn't spare a thought for a mere top-grade magical artifact—something even the poorest Foundation Establishment cultivators wouldn't use.  

Thus, when faced with an attack from such a "lowly" artifact, his instincts deemed it harmless enough to tank.  

The sword foundation pierced through space, tearing through Elder Lü's body with unimaginable speed, leaving a fatal wound.  

As his life force rapidly drained, the Jade Foot Relic sensed it and released him from the trial.  

Elder Lü's consciousness returned just in time to realize his dire state.  

Seeing Li Yuanba and Li Shiming, he knew they had orchestrated this. With no regard for consequences, he unleashed his sealed Golden Core power.  

But it was too late. His surging energy faltered mid-rise.  

Elder Lü's head slumped—his life extinguished.  

Li Shiming swiftly stored the corpse in his machine room space. He and Li Yuanba exchanged prepared storage bags.  

"Fellow Daoist, until we meet again!" Li Yuanba bowed.  

"Next time, let's see who reaches Golden Core first!" Li Shiming laughed.  

Master and clone shared a smile before Li Yuanba departed, white lotuses blooming underfoot as he vanished.  

Li Shiming knew he couldn't linger. After collecting the array flags, he too left on a trail of white lotuses.  

Two breaths later, an explosion echoed—a final contingency, unused in battle but perfect for erasing traces.  

Four breaths after that, eight figures appeared—four arhats and four righteous Golden Core cultivators stationed nearby.  

Detecting Golden Core fluctuations in the Foundation Establishment battlefield, they'd rushed over, suspecting a demonic Golden Core cultivator's intrusion.  

The explosion had obliterated all traces, leaving them puzzled.  

"What technique caused this? There's no spiritual energy residue," Arhat Zhiming muttered, frowning.  

The others shook their heads. None had seen such a powerful mundane explosion before.  

With the battlefield scoured clean, they assumed the demonic Golden Core cultivator had covered his tracks.  

Meanwhile, the three Golden Core elders at the mountain pass checkpoint also sensed the Golden Core fluctuations. Initially suspecting righteous forces had sent reinforcements, they were shocked when Elder Lü's aura vanished.  

A puppet in his temporary cave—imbued with his aura—had gone inert upon his death.  

In normal circumstances, this wouldn't raise alarms, but during wartime, even secluded cultivators maintained an active presence.  

"Did Elder Lü enter the battlefield alone?" one elder asked grimly.  

Knowing some of Elder Lü's techniques—including the ability to suppress his cultivation—they exchanged glances and nodded.  

Using their authority, they forcibly opened Elder Lü's cave.  

Inside, they found only a lifeless puppet.  

"What now?" one elder sighed.  

The puppet's state confirmed Elder Lü's fate. The Golden Core surge on the battlefield must have been his death throes.  

They were certain—Elder Lü had fallen. Otherwise, the puppet wouldn't have lost its imprint.  

Of course, the sect had ways to confirm his death officially.
