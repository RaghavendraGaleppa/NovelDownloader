# Chapter 43: Master, He Doesn’t Want to Kill You  

Li Zhengjing was unaware that Elder Chen Xuan and Xie Changqing had previously clashed over the "Chen Youyu suicide" case. However, after glancing at the waist token, he roughly understood—this was another inner elder from the Chen clan.  

Chen Xuan merely gave him a passing look before turning his attention to Chen Yang. With a slight downward motion of his hand, he signaled for Chen Yang to suppress his anger and let the matter rest.  

Chen Yang immediately understood and stepped back with a bow.  

Soon after, the Gu Yue Peak contingent arrived at the mountain gate and joined disciples from the other peaks.  

"Master, isn’t that the Beast Taming Hall female disciple who swiped a dog from our courtyard not long ago?" the wall-hanging bird muttered quietly, its tone resentful. The loss of a potential hotpot meal still weighed heavily on its mind.  

"Senior Sister He?"  

Li Zhengjing glanced over and met her gaze. They exchanged a nod but showed no further interaction.  

Retracting his gaze, he thought to himself, *"He Qingyu was implicated in the incident involving the out-of-control spirit beasts at Gu Yue Peak’s outer sect and owes a considerable amount of merit. This mission is dangerous, but the rewards are generous—it’s no surprise she’s here."*  

Even if they accomplished nothing on this trip, the talismans, artifacts, and elixirs they had received from the Public Affairs Hall alone were already a substantial reward.  

After the elders from each peak conferred, they led their disciples toward Xuanling Prefecture.  

For the next several days, the group traveled day and night without pause. Since all those dispatched were at the Inner Breath realm, their endurance was exceptional, and they only rested for two or three hours each night.  

By now, they had covered over four thousand *li*, leaving the jurisdiction of the Feather Immortal Sect and approaching Xuanling Prefecture.  

"Master, it’s been quiet these past few days. They haven’t made a move against us," the wall-hanging bird murmured, eyeing Chen Yang’s direction. "Either they’ve had a change of heart, or they’re plotting something worse!"  

"There are over a hundred of us here, including elders and disciples from other peaks. Under so many watchful eyes, Chen Yang wouldn’t dare act recklessly," Li Zhengjing replied.  

"Moreover, we’ve been traveling swiftly these past few days within the Feather Immortal Sect’s territory. It’s a relatively safe area—even if they wanted to cause trouble, they could at most insult me, not take my life."  

He lowered his voice. "But now it’s different. We’ve left the sect’s jurisdiction, and Xuanling Prefecture is just ahead."  

The area around Xuanling Prefecture was now a gathering point for various factions, and the mastermind behind the turmoil—the Gu Dao expert—was likely hiding there.  

The situation ahead was complex, and a single misstep could cost them their lives.  

"Do you think they’ll make their move soon?" the bird asked, eyes gleaming.  

"Most likely," Li Zhengjing whispered. "And these past few days, they’ve had the upper hand while I’ve been on the defensive. Thieves can strike whenever they please, but those guarding against them must remain vigilant day after day. Even I’m feeling the strain now."  

"But Master, you slept like a log last night—even snored," the bird pointed out.  

"To hell with you!" Li Zhengjing snapped. "I sent you to keep an eye on them from the sky, and all you did was spy on me?"  

"My grandfather’s still in the back mountains," the bird retorted before adding, "But I did learn something."  

"What did you find?" Li Zhengjing asked.  

The bird whispered, "Last night, Chen Yang set up a concealment formation. Others couldn’t see it, but my divine eyes as a White Luan Phoenix saw right through it!"  

"So instead of doing your job, you were eavesdropping?" Li Zhengjing smacked the bird, making it yelp before lowering his voice again. "Did Chen Yang personally serve as a bedwarmer?"  

"No, he didn’t. He spent the whole night watching your tent," the bird replied hurriedly. "Master, you must be extremely careful. If he’s not trying to kill you, then he might be—"  

Before Li Zhengjing could strike again, the bird suddenly hissed, "Chen Yang’s coming!"  

With that, it flapped its wings and perched on a tree.  

Li Zhengjing turned to see Chen Yang approaching, his expression icy.  

"Xuanling Prefecture lies ahead. Aside from the Gu King Xin Xuan, factions from other sects are also converging there. The situation is volatile and chaotic," Chen Yang said coldly.  

"After discussion among the elders, it’s been decided that scouts will be dispatched in all directions to monitor the movements of these factions. Since this area borders the Feather Immortal Sect’s territory, if Xin Xuan is captured by another sect within Xuanling Prefecture, it would damage our sect’s prestige."  

He paused before continuing, "Elder Chen Xuan has selected eight disciples for this task—including you. You are to head southwest of Xuanling Prefecture and remain vigilant."  

Li Zhengjing was silent for a moment. "Am I the only one assigned to that direction?"  

Chen Yang replied indifferently, "You’re not being sent to confront Xin Xuan. Your task is merely to observe the surroundings—why would you need more people? A large group would only draw attention. Others will cover the other directions."  

He added, "This is a good opportunity. If you’re lucky enough to stumble upon Xin Xuan’s trail outside Xuanling Prefecture and report back in time, you’ll earn six hundred merit points."  

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "If it’s such a good opportunity, how could I, your junior, take it for myself? Why don’t you go die in my stead?"  

Chen Yang’s face darkened as he flicked his sleeve. "Die? There’s no danger involved. This was decided by Elder Chen Xuan, the appointed leader of our Gu Yue Peak contingent. Are you defying the sect’s laws?"  

"Of course not," Li Zhengjing said with a smile. "I’ll set off immediately and await your esteemed presence at the destination."  

He knew full well that Chen Yang wanted to isolate him to eliminate him in secret.  

But Li Zhengjing, too, had plans to ensure Chen Yang met a quiet end in an isolated location.  

Still, he glanced at the golden page in his mind and pondered further.  

Nearby, He Qingyu noticed the exchange and frowned, about to rise to her feet—only for the Beast Taming Hall elder beside her to press a hand on her shoulder.  

"This is an internal matter for Gu Yue Peak. It has nothing to do with the Beast Taming Hall."
