Chapter 339: Past Sins and Present Vengeance

The medicinal soup had been simmering for thousands of years, its potency brewing and yielding miraculous effects. It could strengthen the body and fortify the soul, nourish the five internal organs, toughen the skin, harmonize yin and yang, and prolong life. Its energy was thick and vigorous. Wisps of purple mist drifted upward, reflecting a faint purple-red glow on the faces nearby. The surroundings were paved with jade bricks and red tiles, adorned with exquisite porcelain and famous artifacts. The sound of flowing water could be heard nearby, creating a scene of impeccable beauty—serene, secluded, and undisturbed.

It did not feel like a tomb at all, but rather like a private chamber deep within a "Worry-Free Tower." It was a blissful realm, seemingly detached from the world, where one could indulge in joy without being bothered by external affairs. Wen Caishang was unpredictable. In the past, to "tame" her husband, she often used her sword and whip, punishing him whether she was angry or happy, inflicting physical pain and practicing the "Heart-Wrenching Sword," which caused unbearable agony. Since childhood, she had held an extremely high status and possessed impeccable manners. Even when slaughtering others or taking lives, she maintained a polite and graceful demeanor on the surface. It was rare to see her lose her temper, lose composure, or panic.

However, the sins of the past were to be repaid today. Li Xian did not need to stab her with a sword, but he thought, "Since things have come to this, if I don't vent my anger now, wouldn't that make my wife too arrogant? Today, I'll collect some interest. Later, when I surpass her, I'll collect the principal." He grabbed Wen Caishang.

Wen Caishang's ankle was caught. She thought, "My martial arts evolution and internal energy are useless now. This brat has taken advantage of this to bully me." She turned around and splashed the water, sending countless water droplets flying toward him. The splash contained the essence of many sword techniques. Although there was no killing intent, if it hit, it would undoubtedly cause pain.

Li Xian waved his hand, and his Pure Yang Energy Cloak swirled in the air, gathering the water into a ball and throwing it back into the medicinal soup. Wen Caishang was both ashamed and angry. The obedient "husband" of the past was now rebelling and bullying her. She had expected this, but the feeling was incredibly strange. She couldn't help but scold in a seductive voice, "You little bastard, you... you've rebelled!"

Li Xian laughed. "You're allowed to bully me, but I'm not allowed to fight back? There's no such道理 (reason) in this world. This is a rare opportunity. If I miss it, wouldn't it be a pity? Just surrender obediently, my wife."

Wen Caishang cursed coquettishly, "Good for you, you ungrateful little thing. It seems you've wanted to bully me for a long time. Asking me to surrender? Hmph, you'll have to ask the sword in my hand first." Her tone wasn't fierce, however. Her palm flipped, and a "White Snake Soft Sword" appeared out of nowhere underwater, thrusting toward Li Xian.

Her White Snake Sword moved like a spirit snake underwater, flexible and eerie. The blade became flexible and tough, with absolutely no intention of harming Li Xian. It was just to save face and resist with restraint. How could she truly allow Li Xian to turn the tables on her? This sword move was called "Coiling Waist to Claim Life," aiming to use the soft sword to entangle the opponent's waist. It was her original sword technique, extremely exquisite.

Li Xian's vision was sharp. He reached out with his fingers and夹 (clamped) the soft sword, holding it three inches from the blade. Wen Caishang was secretly shocked: "The Eye of the Double Pupil is indeed extraordinary. This little wolf cub is getting harder to control as he grows. This time, he's really biting me." She twisted her wrist, and the White Snake Soft Sword coiled around Li Xian's wrist.

Li Xian turned his wrist to undo the sword. The two exchanged several moves, causing waves in the water. Although there was no danger, it was indeed a contest. Li Xian possessed immense strength, yet he was not without finesse. Combined with the Eye of the Double Pupil and his Perfect Physique, he could constantly spot flaws. Wen Caishang was experienced and ruthless, with an endless stream of moves. With just the White Snake Soft Sword, a Void-芥 Demon Robe, and a basic White Snake sword technique, she could perform wonders. The soft sword, though lacking a sharp edge, could be used for缠 (binding), striking,绕 (coiling),虚 (feints), and实 (real attacks)—its changes were unpredictable.

As the sword blade struck the water waves, Wen Caishang gradually felt the strain. The influence of the bell here made it difficult for her to overpower Li Xian. Li Xian suddenly used his "Pure Yang Energy Cloak" to stir the water. With a mighty swing, the cloak dragged the water, causing the pool's waves to surge violently, making Wen Caishang lose her footing. Moreover... although her words of resistance were strong, her will to resist was not firm. Unconsciously, she even felt a hint of anticipation and curiosity: "If Li Xian were to truly win, given that I've always bullied him, what would become of me?"

She deliberately made a mistake with her hands and naturally lost, allowing Li Xian to get close and grab her wrist.

Li Xian smiled. "My wife, you've lost." She bit her red lips tightly, unable to break free. Combined with the effects of the medicinal soup, her mind was in a turmoil. Now, she had no strength to resist. She didn't know if she was angry or happy as she said, "You... you've got some nerve! You... you actually found the chance. I'm in your hands now. Kill or cut me as you please."

Li Xian looked at the once vicious and venomous woman, who was now quite docile. Although she was scolding and acting tough on the surface, her eyes contained a tender glow, adding a风情 (charm) of attachment and a柔弱 (delicate) demeanor. He couldn't help but recall their journey of escape. Wen Caishang seemed angry, but she seemed to greatly enjoy this role reversal, reveling in it without realizing it.

Li Xian said, "Alright, then I'll really let you taste the pain of killing and cutting." Wen Caishang felt a strange feeling in her heart. She seemed annoyed, but she didn't necessarily reject it. She stubbornly said, "You little thief, do I fear you? Bring it on."

Meanwhile, the Five Mountain Sword Alliance had gone through many twists and turns. After two days of healing, thanks to the thoughtful care of the women, their energy and blood had recovered quickly, and they could move freely. They could fight as long as they held their swords.

Xiao Wanjian, Hu Yueyue, and other leader elders gathered under a banyan tree, surrounded by ordinary elders, to discuss future arrangements. Each sect spoke up, sharing their views and plans. They were generally in agreement.

Since they now knew the true culprit, they naturally believed that debts must be paid and grievances settled by the right party. However, the Five Mountain Sword Alliance had no experts in tomb exploration. They had reached this point solely by relying on their profound martial arts, overcoming dangers and breaking obstacles. They had suffered many hidden losses. Although most of the mechanisms on their way here had been broken, it was hard to say what they would encounter if they returned the same way.

Furthermore, the bell's influence was mysterious. The martial arts cultivation of the various sects was difficult to use; martial arts evolution and internal energy were all lost. After being beaten single-handedly by Li Xian again, their morale was greatly dampened, and they had to be even more cautious.

Hu Yueyue said, "This place is strange. The priority is to leave this tomb first. The treasures hidden in this tomb are certainly numerous, but they are not for us to touch. Protecting the disciples' lives and quickly escaping this dangerous place is the top priority."

Xiao Wanjian said, "That He Wentian is deep-thinking. He disappeared early on, probably because he realized his tracks were exposed and was afraid we would capture him, so he secretly slipped away. If we return the same way now, we will definitely be ambushed by him."

Wang Zongheng said in a deep voice, "Although the disciples' injuries are no longer a problem, there are only a few hundred of them. If He Wentian uses the advantage of the terrain to deploy troops and set up formations in advance, ambushing us at various key points, it would be extremely difficult for us to break through."

The elders of the various sword sects fell silent. Another dangerous situation was laid before them. Duan Yixin said, "If it weren't for the bell's influence, even though our sects have few disciples, we wouldn't fear He Wentian. Not to mention He Wentian, even that... that wife and that少年 (young man), we wouldn't need to fear."

Hou Yuande said, "Brother Duan, why bring that up? The main thing now is to formulate a foolproof plan. Hypotheticals and empty talk... can be discussed after we leave the tomb. That He Wentian is extremely cautious, and he is not familiar with the main hall. Presumably, although he holds a large force, he wouldn't dare enter the hall rashly. We have ample time and no immediate danger, so we can slowly discuss our strategy."

Hu Yueyue said, "That's true. I've already sent disciples to catch some grass snakes, wild fruits, and wild herbs to cook along the way. I estimate it can last us a few days."

Xiao Wanjian said, "It's a pity that our sword sect's style is too upright. We disdain to rob tombs and dig graves. Including myself, we are all clueless about this."

Hu Yueyue suddenly said, "If we're talking about tomb expertise, among us, I'm afraid no one is better than that person."

The elders said in unison, "Her?" They thought of the lady in the white skirt, feeling a strange emotion in their hearts.

Xiao Wanjian said, "Hmph, although the matter has been clarified, it can't just be glossed over so easily. Why did you bring her up all of a sudden?"

Hu Yueyue said, "Let's put that matter aside for now. That He Wentian is also a threat to her. Perhaps we can temporarily set aside our past differences and work together to overcome this difficulty. We can sit down and discuss a solution later."

Xiao Wanjian waved his sleeve. "I have nothing to say to that seductive woman." Wang Zongheng pondered for a moment and said, "Elder Hu, that Wen Caishang is definitely not a good person. We know very little about her. Collaborating with her is probably no different from plotting with a tiger. If she betrays us then, the danger might be far worse than He Wentian."

The leader elders and accompanying elders all nodded in agreement. Wang Tiexin said, "Moreover, the entanglement inside is hard to explain. Her thoughts are unpredictable. She is not a suitable partner."

Hu Yueyue said, "This Wen Caishang is indeed not a good person, but..." She hesitated for a moment and said, "The young man beside her, Li Xian, seems quite decent."

It turned out... Hu Yueyue was the "Dingjian" Elder of the Hushan Sword Sect. He Wentian had secretly done evil deeds, and the Hushan Sword Sect suffered heavy losses, with all its elders and disciples missing. Now that they had been recovered, she felt very apologetic and comforted the sect's disciples. During their conversations, they often talked about Li Xian, and her view of him gradually changed.

Xiao Wanjian said in a deep voice, "This kid is even less of a good thing. At such a young age, his methods are strange, and he doesn't have the humility of a young man!"

Duan Yixin said, "And his origin and identity are still a mystery. His real name is Li Xian, and he did save the women. But he also used the alias 'Hua Wucuo' and made a name for himself in the Hualong Sect. That is also a fact. Although the women were not captured by him, with such an identity, can he be considered innocent?"

Wang Zongheng said, "My view is different. This young man's origin is indeed not clean, but he doesn't seem like an evil person." Hou Yuande nodded. "That's not false."

Xiao Wanjian disliked Li Xian immensely. Hearing others praise him, he felt a hint of displeasure. "Even so, what use is this brat besides having immense strength to help us resist powerful enemies? When facing a thousand or more strong soldiers and hidden arrows, even if he is厉害 (capable), can he really turn the sky upside down?"

Hu Yueyue said, "That's not the case. Rather than collaborating with Li Xian, it's better to say we are still collaborating with that Madam Wen. Li Xian is more amiable. If he acts as a middleman, that Madam Wen is an expert in tombs. She might cleverly use the tomb's mechanisms to eliminate the enemy's forces, or find another passage to avoid the many dangers. In the current situation, if this lady is willing to help, our chances of escaping this predicament could increase by thirty percent."

The elders were all moved upon hearing this. Duan Yixin also said, "That Madam Wen seems to care a lot about him. If he mediates, it might really work." Wang Zongheng clapped his hands in approval and said, "I think it's quite feasible. Don't be fooled by that lady's厉害 (ferocity), I can see that she listens to Li Xian's advice. If Li Xian helps, even if that lady dislikes us, she might not go against him. The way she called him 'Li Lang' and 'Little Lang' made our hearts go weak."

Hou Yuande said, "I didn't expect this 'Zhejian' Madam to have a sword she couldn't折 (break). Instead, she is willing to use herself as a scabbard to nurture a sharp sword."

Xiao Wanjian saw the situation and said calmly, "Since that's the case, seeking their cooperation is not out of the question. But I'm afraid that if those two call out, they might mistake us for pursuers."

Hu Yueyue said, "That's fine. We can just send female disciples." Duan Yixin said, "That's not good. If that lady gets jealous, will she still listen to Li Xian? Such a fierce woman loves jealousy the most. When she's jealous, even Li Xian will suffer."

Wang Zongheng said, "How about this: each elder will take a few people and search nearby. During the search, we must be respectful and polite. If we meet them, we should state our intentions immediately, without delay."

Wang Zongheng said strangely, "I'm just afraid of disturbing the two of them..." The elders discussed and came to a conclusion. Each sect's elder formed a team and dispersed to search the hall. Xu Hu of the Yangshan Sword Sect led five disciples from his sect and went deep into the garden landscape first.

They searched and called out for half a day but saw no sign of them. Xu Hu then told the disciples to sit on a large rock and rest. He called out, "You guys are lucky to have met me. I secretly saved some dry rations. Take them and share them!" He took out an oil paper containing five coarse pancakes.

The pancakes were covered with sweat. After being in the tomb for so long, the coarse pancakes had been soaked dry by sweat. They were barely holding their shape after being soaked in water, and their taste was no longer pleasant. But the disciples were extremely hungry and snatched them to eat.

They were quickly devoured, and they even found them delicious, asking Xu Hu if he had any more. Xu Hu scolded them with a laugh, lectured the disciples, ate the remaining coarse pancake, patted his body, and went to search again.

Xu Hu was a rough man, and he had no particular way of searching. He just looked around and shouted loudly. He wandered around muddle-headedly, not knowing where he had gone. Suddenly, one disciple trembled all over and pleaded, "Elder Xu... this place is unclean. Let's... let's go!"

Xu Hu glared. "Nonsense! Where is it unclean? I think it's quite clean." The disciple said, "I... I seem to have heard some strange sounds."

Xu Hu was curious. "Oh?"

The disciple said, "I have the 'Ear Pearl Physique,' and I'm very sensitive to sounds. Although I can't hear clearly, I have a vague feeling that it's definitely there." As he spoke, he turned his head, revealing a peculiar ear with a fleshy pearl on the earlobe.

Another disciple said, "Maybe it's the sound of those two?" Xu Hu felt uneasy and said, "That's very possible. You lead the way by the sound, and we'll go take a look. If there are really ghosts, we'll just turn around and run."

The group followed the sound, winding left and right, going deeper and deeper, but they felt more and more uneasy. The surrounding vegetation was dense, and pavilions stood tall. Although they were magnificent and imposing, they lacked the nourishment of human presence and appeared gloomy and oppressive.

Xu Hu looked rough and spoke boldly, but in reality, his courage was average. The disciple was initially very fearful, but gradually his face turned red, his fear faded, and he walked faster and faster. Xu Hu cursed, "Damn it, are you possessed? You're braver than me." He quickened his pace to follow.

The disciple led the way to a room and whispered to Xu Hu and the others, "Don't talk, don't talk, I'll take a look first." His tone even contained excitement. He lay against a paper window, wet his finger with saliva, and poked a hole in the window paper. He immediately covered his eye to observe. The movements were done in one fluid motion. He saw that the interior was exquisite and luxurious, with a purple bath pool. The pool was filled with a fragrant mist and white vapor.

The scene he had imagined did not appear. The bath pool was empty and quiet, with no trace of people. The disciple trembled all over, as if waking from a dream. His excitement turned to shock and confusion. It turned out... this disciple was a lecher. He possessed the "Ear Pearl Physique," with a fleshy pearl on his earlobe that could sense faint sounds. He was young and vigorous, unable to suppress his urges. Whenever he heard sounds from a room, he would always follow the sound and peek from a distance.

He had faintly heard a strange sound earlier. Because the tomb was gloomy, he thought it was the movement of ghosts and was terrified. Later, as he followed the sound, he heard the sound continuous and melodious, rising and falling, and unending. His heart was restless; he had never heard such a跌宕 (undulating) sound. He thought to himself, "This sound is like a song, beautiful and graceful, like ascending to paradise. Oh dear, it would be a great pity if I don't go and see." He walked faster and faster, his heart filled with nothing but unbearable curiosity.

But when he reached this place, he neither heard strange sounds nor saw any shadows. He couldn't help but tremble. The infinite fantasies he had just had turned into piercing cold ice. He felt his back turn cold, and his legs went weak, causing him to fall. Xu Hu grabbed him and also peeked through the hole. He said, "If I'm not mistaken, this is the place where emperors bathed. The mist is gloomy, indeed strange."

The disciple exclaimed, "Ah! This was originally a bathing place, then... then it's even more certain! It must be... must be ghosts!" Xu Hu frowned and asked, "What did you hear? It's so strange, tell me quickly. If you hesitate again, I'll slap you to death." The disciple quickly said, "It's... it's that kind of sound. Since this is the emperor's bathing place, could it be that after their death, their ghosts came back here for pleasure? I vaguely heard it, and then I was led here..."

Xu Hu suddenly felt a chill. A cold wind blew past, and he dared not stay any longer. He said, "That's... that's creepy. Presumably, those two aren't here either. The pool is empty, and that pool water looks like it contains a deadly poison. Let's go quickly and check elsewhere."

The group ran away from the place. As soon as they left, bubbles rose from the pool.

Two days later.

[You diligently practiced the third layer of the sword technique, gained many insights, felt a surge of satisfaction and excitement, and increased your proficiency by 321.]

[You combined it with the medicinal bath, and increased your proficiency by 231.]

[Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword · Third Layer]

[Proficiency: 5831/8000 (Small Success)]

The effects of the Purple Smoke Mandarin Duck Soup were fully absorbed. There was a meditation cushion beside the Menglai Pool. Li Xian sat cross-legged and meditated, feeling the medicinal power surging and benefiting immensely. However, the medicinal properties were complex; many precious, good, and marvelous herbs were mixed in one pool, making it difficult to describe the specifics in a short time.

In one day's work, the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword's third layer accumulated [4000] proficiency, yielding great benefits. He gained a deeper understanding of the principles of yin and yang and the various道理 (principles) of martial arts. Li Xian felt refreshed and spirited. Seeing the leisurely scenery outside, he suddenly thought: "If this place weren't isolated from the world and had a bit more human presence, it would be quite suitable for a long stay."

There was a silver mirror on the east side of the Menglai Pool. Li Xian glanced at it unintentionally and thought: "This medicinal bath seems to have made my skin more delicate and flexible." After observing for a moment, he realized his clothes were in tatters. He jumped to the bottom of the pool to捞 (dredge) for them.

He quickly found his wife's white boots, poured out the medicinal soup, and threw them onto the poolside. Then came the silk socks, white skirt, undergarments, and private clothes. Li Xian's clothes were very simple, so he quickly found them all.

He then went to chop some twigs and leaves and lit a fire to dry the clothes. It turned out that Xu Hu and the others had not searched in vain; they were just a hair's breadth away from uncovering the two's private affairs. Li Xian's hair had played a妙 (wonderful) role. Knowing someone was searching, he had hidden in the water in advance. He sank the changed clothes into the pool, completely concealing their tracks.

Wen Caishang complained, "You little bastard, if those hairpins and ornaments are lost, it'll be your fault." Her long hair was like a waterfall, and today her authority had been greatly挫 (dampened). Although her appearance was beautiful, she never forgot to dress up. Hairpins, jade anchors,步摇 (hair ornaments)... all were accessories she carried with her to enhance her beauty. But they had all been washed away by the water and lost.

Li Xian agreed with a smile, then dived into the pool again and retrieved all the lost hairpins,步摇, jade anchors, and pearl chains. After everything was taken care of and the clothes were dried, Wen Caishang draped her white skirt and carefully arranged her long hair. She handed the hairpins,步摇, jade anchors, etc., to Li Xian for him to help her put on the ornaments.

Li Xian, taught by her, was quite proficient in this. Inserting hairpins, setting anchors... soon, the lady was dignified and beautiful as ever, with an added charm between her brows. Li Xian looked in the mirror and suddenly said with curiosity, "My wife, with her hair up, must be extremely beautiful too."

Wen Caishang smiled. "Since you're curious, then you do it." She pulled out the hairpin holding her hair, and her long hair cascaded down like a waterfall, its fragrance tickling his nose. Li Xian's "Excellent Hands" trait helped Wen Caishang coil her hair into a bun, making her look more dignified and mature than before.

Li Xian supported her right hand, applying force to lift her. Wen Caishang leaned her body slightly, using the force to stand up. She couldn't help but give Li Xian a fierce glare and spat, "You little bastard, always making me suffer." She walked slowly.

Li Xian said, "I see that you don't resist it." Wen Caishang glared and cursed, "It's because I can't do anything to you, otherwise how could I allow you to... Forget it, let's not talk about this. I'll think of a way to punish you later and get this resentment out."

Wen Caishang said, "Alright, there's probably nothing more to gain in this tomb. Let's prepare to go out." Li Xian said casually, "Who would have thought that being in a tomb could bring such romance and风花雪月 (wind, flowers, snow, and moon). My wife, why don't we just stay here and live in seclusion?"

Wen Caishang laughed. "I know you too well. If you were really so content, you wouldn't have run away back then. You're just saying this to make me happy."

She said, "I've thought it through clearly. Last time you ran away was because I forced you to gouge out your eyes, which scared you away. This won't happen again in the future. Li Lang... if that's the case, will you listen to me properly and stay with me forever?"

Li Xian said, "Even if you wanted to gouge out my eyes, I would still stay with you. You taught me martial arts and knowledge. In my heart, you will always be number one."

Wen Caishang smiled. "Your words, I'm afraid you've said them to every woman. I don't believe you. But for us to be able to open our hearts and break down the barrier is truly rare."

Li Xian said, "My wife is so reasonable, it really makes me..." Wen Caishang said jokingly, "Do you want me to ask you to extend your hand so I can stab you a few times with the Heart-Wrenching Sword?"

The two walked unhurriedly, talking and laughing as they returned to the pavilion in the middle of the lake. The Five Sects were nowhere to be seen. Wen Caishang smiled. "They sent people to find us before, presumably because they knew they were surrounded by He Wentian and wanted to cooperate with us."

"They couldn't find us, so they naturally took the risk to try to save themselves."

Li Xian thought of Lin Aoshan, Zhao Chunxia, and the other women. Although he had known them for a short time, he didn't want them to be in danger. Wen Caishang said, "Are you worried about them?" Li Xian said, "Not really. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance and I have no friendship. Whether they are injured or dead, I don't care."

Wen Caishang thought: "But you care a lot about the beautiful women in the sword sects." She said softly, "The Five Great Sword Sects have a foothold in the Jianghu. They must have some ability. They won't need you, this little bastard, to take care of everything."

Li Xian thought to himself: "That makes sense. My wife has been in the Jianghu for a long time, and her experience is beyond mine. I should listen to her. I'll leave the cave first and then think about what to do next."

Wen Caishang said, "The paths of the Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Cave are intricate. Although He Wentian has occupied this cave for a long time, he may not be as familiar with it as I am. Let me observe for a bit, and I'll be able to find a rarely used passage to leave."
