# Chapter 132: Corpses Strewn Across the Fields, Surviving the Calamity

This sudden drastic change undoubtedly caught everyone off guard. As the Old Monster Yin Demon roared outside, inside Qingxi Sect, a hint of schadenfreude couldn't help but rise in the eyes of the crowd. After all, though they didn't obtain the Wood Spirit Seed, the Yin Demon Sect, which had repeatedly interfered, also ended up with nothing.

After venting his frustration with a roar while possessing the bald man, the Old Monster Yin Demon's gaze shifted. He coldly stared at Xin Wuya, black mist swirling around him. "Was it your doing?"

Xin Wuya's expression and eyes were incredibly complex at this moment. "If I could invite a Nascent Soul stage senior to act, why would I have let you force me to give it up?"

The Old Monster Yin Demon gazed deeply at Xin Wuya again, knowing that what he said made sense. Someone able to withstand his possessed strike must undoubtedly be a Nascent Soul cultivator. But if Qingxi Sect could indeed invite a Nascent Soul cultivator, Xin Wuya would certainly not have let go of the Wood Spirit Seed just now.

"Let's go!" The Old Monster Yin Demon roared, unwilling to give up. Immediately, all the black mist retracted into the bald man's body, disappearing in a blink. The bald man, now restored to normal, had a very poor complexion. It was unclear if this was due to injuries from the array's counterattack or from the Old Monster Yin Demon's possession.

In fact, he wasn't the only one with a bad complexion. Fat Elder Xie Chang, the thin dark-skinned old man, Xin Wuya, the green-robed Elder Yang... not a single Core Formation cultivator present looked well. Everyone had worked hard, but no one gained anything.

The bald man also took a deep look at the Qingxi Sect members within the array, then said resentfully, "We're leaving." With that, the six Core Formation cultivators transformed into six streaks of light and vanished into the sky in an instant.

Xin Wuya stood in the air, watching the streaks of light fly away for a long time before letting out a long sigh. Turning his head, he looked at the green-robed Elder Yang on the ground, and also at Tong Wanqing, the silver-haired Elder Mu, and the dark-faced Elder Zhu, who had now come forward. His eyes were filled with loss, mixed with incredibly complex emotions. "This step, in the end, was a mistake. A great opportunity for the Dao..."

Everyone remained silent; no one responded to Xin Wuya's words. What they were thinking, however, remained unclear.

At this moment, the silver-haired Elder Mu's expression suddenly changed. "Not good, our Qi Condensation disciples are still outside!" Saying this, she immediately transformed into a streak of light and flew towards the outside of the sect. "Elder Mu, I'll go with you." The dark-faced Elder Zhu also followed closely.

And just as the two flew off, hundreds of miles away, the six members of the Yin Demon Sect appeared in the sky. Looking at the black mist below, the thin black-clothed old man, who had previously thrown the Soul-Summoning Banner, raised his hand and sneered, "Let these Qingxi Sect disciples all be sacrificed to my Soul-Summoning Banner!"

"Dao brother, wait!" At this moment, the stout Xie Chang suddenly spoke to stop him. "The previous Sect Master of Qingxi Sect greatly favored me. This action was largely out of helplessness, primarily due to Xin Wuya. These are just Qi Condensation disciples; it's already unfortunate that they were exploited by the Sect Master. Dao brother, please do me a small favor and spare their lives."

The thin black-clothed old man chuckled upon hearing Xie Chang's words. "Staying among those so-called righteous sects for too long makes one hypocritical." Despite his words, the thin black-clothed old man eventually lowered his hand. Then, with a casual flick towards the Soul-Summoning Banner, all the black mist and ghostly figures returned to the banner. Simultaneously, the Soul-Summoning Banner automatically flew into the thin black-clothed old man's hand. The six paid no more attention to the ground below and continued their escape.

Below, after the black mist dissipated, the figures of the Qi Condensation disciples on the ground were revealed. The situation in the forest was horrific beyond description. It would not be an exaggeration to call it a scene of corpses strewn across the fields and rivers of blood. Of nearly two thousand Qi Condensation disciples, only a mere three to four hundred were still standing, and almost all of them were still fighting and killing each other. In one corner of the crowd, Chu Ning and Mu Ling stood together, with several corpses also lying around them.

Upon seeing the black mist dissipate, both of their faces flashed with joy. But when they looked at the scene before them again, their expressions turned extremely ugly. Mu Ling even directly turned her head away, unable to bear another look. But at this moment, a Qi Condensation ninth-layer cultivator not far away, with bloodshot eyes, was dashing towards them. It was clear he intended to attack directly.

Upon seeing this, Chu Ning immediately roared, "Stop!" As the ghost mist had vanished, Chu Ning used a bit of his spiritual sense while roaring. The Qi Condensation ninth-layer disciple, hearing this, actually gained a sliver of clarity, and his movements paused for a moment. But immediately, he raised his magic tool, ready to strike again. Just as Chu Ning sighed and raised his high-grade magic tool, preparing to strike first...

"Everyone, stop!" An angry voice came from the sky.

"Grandma?" Hearing this voice, Mu Ling immediately looked up at the sky in surprise. Chu Ning also followed the sound and saw the sect's silver-haired Elder Mu and the dark-faced Elder Zhu appearing. He immediately let out a long sigh of relief. Then, he saw the dark-faced Elder Zhu take out a gourd-shaped magic treasure from his hand. The mouth of the gourd faced downwards, and immediately, streaks of yellow light fell, enveloping the three to four hundred disciples who had just stopped due to Elder Mu's roar. This also included Chu Ning and Mu Ling.

Immediately after coming into contact with the yellow light, the more than three hundred disoriented disciples all collapsed to the ground, unconscious. Chu Ning, on the other hand, only felt a warm sensation all over his body, and the fear brought by the ghost mist instantly disappeared. However, Chu Ning carefully examined himself and found that his depleted spiritual sense liquid had not recovered. It seemed that this item only dispelled the yin spirits and ghosts, but could not help nourish spiritual sense.

At this point, the two Core Formation elders descended from the sky, their gazes falling on Chu Ning and Mu Ling with some surprise, then lingering on Chu Ning. Mu Ling's Jade Ruyi Scepter was originally made by the dark-faced Elder Zhu and given by the silver-haired Elder Mu. They naturally knew that this item had the effect of resisting the invasion of yin spirits and ghosts. However, for Chu Ning, a "Qi Condensation sixth-layer" cultivator, to also be safe and sound, was quite unexpected for them.

The dark-faced elder's gaze fell upon the Soul Stabilizing Pearl in Chu Ning's hand, and he asked in surprise, "You actually have a magic tool that resists yin spirits and ghosts?" Although Chu Ning hadn't bought the Soul Stabilizing Pearl himself, at this moment, he could only brace himself and say, "This disciple fortunately bought a Soul Stabilizing Pearl at the outer market before."

Hearing Chu Ning's explanation, the dark-faced elder nodded but didn't ask further. The silver-haired Elder Mu didn't even give it a second look.

Clearly, this level of magic tool was simply beneath the notice of Core Formation cultivators like them. The two swept their gazes around, exchanged a look, and then both shook their heads. Elder Mu sighed and said, "Some were directly struck down by the ghost creatures, their spiritual sense shattered, while others died from fighting each other. Even those who are alive, after returning, their spiritual sense will be difficult to recover for at least half a year to a year. This time, the sect's losses are truly immense. And those disciples cultivating wood-attribute techniques, so few of them managed to get out. Sect Master..."

At this point, Elder Mu's words abruptly stopped, and she looked at Chu Ning and Mu Ling. "This mission is now completely over. Only the two of you are conscious here. I'm afraid when you return to the sect, the Sect Master will have many questions for you. Remember to answer everything truthfully, without hiding anything."

Saying this, the silver-haired Elder Mu turned to the dark-faced elder and said, "Elder Zhu, take those who are alive back. As for the others..."

"Let them stay here. Bringing them back to the sect would only cause trouble. Later, the sect will arrange for others to come and collect their storage bags." The dark-faced Elder Zhu said, repeatedly waving his hand to cast spells. He threw the surviving disciples, one by one, into the massive flying boat that had previously carried them. Then, after Chu Ning was also called onto the flying boat, the flying boat ascended into the sky and flew towards Qingxi Sect. As for Mu Ling, she naturally followed Elder Mu.

Seeing that the dark-faced elder seemed relatively easy to talk to, Chu Ning couldn't help but ask, somewhat puzzled, "Elder, this place doesn't seem far from our sect. Why did we seemingly travel for a long time when we first came?"

"That was to take a detour to avoid drawing attention," the dark-faced elder answered, indeed without concealment. "However, I also didn't expect the spiritual seed's location to be so close to the sect."

Although Chu Ning hadn't experienced the great battle outside the sect, he had seen the blue light in the direction of the sect. Recalling how he had directly broken through the restrictions from within the sect under Ling Xiaobai's guidance, he couldn't help but ask again, "Elder, since this spiritual domain is so close to us, why did no one ever sense any restrictions nearby when passing by?"

"This spiritual domain was formed because of the spiritual seed itself; it's a minor world. It merely overlaps spatially with our world. If one doesn't enter it, it's naturally impossible to discover."

Chu Ning nodded upon hearing the dark-faced Elder Zhu's answer. In fact, he had roughly guessed as much. But now that the other party had explained, it truly resolved his doubts. Chu Ning opened his mouth, wanting to ask what had happened to the Yin Demon Sect members and the spiritual seed. However, remembering that both the dark-faced Elder Zhu and the silver-haired Elder Mu had looked unwell when they appeared earlier, he decided not to ask at that moment.

Anyway, he would soon return to the sect, and he should be able to hear some news. After all, the matter of the spiritual seed was now public knowledge, and he believed that many rumors would circulate once they returned to the sect.

The group quickly returned to the sect. Given all that had just happened, the two Core Formation elders naturally had no time to bother with them. They placed Chu Ning and Mu Ling in the outer courtyard and instructed them to wait in their respective courtyards; the sect would call them if they needed to understand the situation. Then, the two elders flew directly towards the inner sect.

"You mean, the Sect Master of the Yin Demon Sect, a Nascent Soul cultivator, possessed someone and forced our Sect Master to hand over the Wood Spirit Seed? And then another Nascent Soul cultivator intervened midway, causing the spiritual seed to escape?"

As he walked towards his own courtyard, Chu Ning listened to the news from Mu Ling, his eyes filled with astonishment. On the way, Elder Mu had told Mu Ling what had happened, and Mu Ling had roughly recounted it to Chu Ning. Chu Ning was deeply shocked by the news he heard.

That Elder Tong actually was a Core Formation elder before; this time, he had forcefully displayed Core Formation magical power with the aid of a secret treasure to help dispel the array. It was said that he only had one month left to live. The green-robed Elder Yang's Core was destroyed, and all his cultivation was lost. Even if he recovered, he would at most reach the Foundation Establishment stage, and possibly even fall back to the Qi Condensation stage. And that stout, seemingly benevolent Elder Xie had actually defected to the Yin Demon Sect. The Elder Gui, who had previously instructed everyone to take the Barrier Breaking Pill, was severely injured and his whereabouts unknown. Moreover, even under such circumstances, the Wood Spirit Seed was not obtained as the sect wished.

Chu Ning also recalled the more than a thousand Qi Condensation disciples who had died violently in the wilderness, and the hundreds of disciples cultivating wood-attribute techniques who had entered the Five Elements Qiankun Array with him. "Thousands of lives sacrificed."

After bidding farewell to Mu Ling and returning to his courtyard, Chu Ning looked up, his expression incredibly complex.

Even though Chu Ning had witnessed much death since he began cultivating, and had killed many people himself, seeing one to two thousand people die before him still filled him with an inexplicable sadness, as he had never experienced such a thing before. He looked at his courtyard and felt an impulse to escape. "Still not enough experience, my inner strength isn't strong enough," Chu Ning said with a bitter smile, shaking his head.

At this moment, he neither wanted to stay in his courtyard nor had any desire to cultivate. So, he simply left the courtyard again and walked in the direction of the Spiritual Plant Room.

Midway, Chu Ning detoured to Zhuang Yunde's courtyard and couldn't help but stop and look at it for a few moments. Although his relationship with Senior Brother Zhuang initially started with a transaction, after prolonged contact, the two had developed some friendship. However, their experiences in the Five Elements Qiankun Array, where they were on the same side, were not the same. In Chu Ning's opinion, Zhuang Yunde should have had plenty of spirit stones, so he wondered why he hadn't prepared better defensive items. Shaking his head, Chu Ning stopped thinking about this meaningless question.

He directly exited the outer sect and went to Qiu Shunyi's residence. Qiu Shunyi was also extremely surprised by Chu Ning's arrival. When he learned that Chu Ning had just returned from outside and asked if he had witnessed the great battle outside the sect earlier, Qiu Shunyi immediately began to narrate animatedly. "I saw it! All of us saw it..."

Unlike Mu Ling's brief recount, Qiu Shunyi, who had personally witnessed the great battle not long ago, now recounted many more details. It wasn't until he finished his entire narration that Chu Ning's gaze fell on the place where the great battle had just occurred.

"Nascent Soul cultivators. In this cultivation world, cultivation indeed represents everything. That Old Monster Yin Demon is a Nascent Soul cultivator; even if he didn't attack, Xin Wuya, as the Sect Master of Qingxi Sect, would have to obediently hand over the Wood Spirit Seed he had obtained. Even though he knew that handing it over would waste decades of the sect's efforts and the fruits obtained at the cost of tens of thousands of disciples' lives." Chu Ning exhaled lightly. "Strength is paramount." After this incident, Chu Ning felt that he had gained a deeper understanding of many things.

"Chu Ning?" Just as Chu Ning was about to chat a bit more with Qiu Shunyi, a familiar voice suddenly came from outside the courtyard. Chu Ning stepped out and saw that it was He Changyou and Liao Yunming arriving together.

"Greetings to the two Stewards." Chu Ning immediately bowed, but Liao Yunming stopped him directly. "No need for such formalities, hurry up and come with us, the Sect Master and the Elders are waiting for you."

Chu Ning nodded upon hearing this. Elder Mu had mentioned it earlier, so Chu Ning wasn't entirely surprised. However, the two Stewards were able to find him so accurately... A chill ran down Chu Ning's spine at this thought. He hadn't told anyone that he was coming to find Qiu Shunyi. "So, ever since I returned to the sect, someone has been observing my every move? And I couldn't even detect it?" A very uncomfortable thought arose in Chu Ning's mind.

However, at this moment, he naturally wouldn't ask the two Stewards why they were able to find him. "The Sect Master and Elders are waiting; let's fly directly using a magic tool. Chu Ning, get on." He Changyou said, releasing a spiritual boat capable of carrying seven or eight people. After Chu Ning boarded, the flying boat flew straight towards the inner sect. Behind them, Qiu Shunyi stared at the direction Chu Ning and the others departed, his mouth agape. "The Sect Master and Elders summoned Chu Ning?"

Dense spiritual energy, swirling white mist, grand pavilions with jade eaves... Upon entering the inner sect, Chu Ning immediately felt the imposing grandeur of a cultivation sect. This place was truly a world apart from the outer sect.

He Changyou carried Chu Ning steadily upwards, eventually landing outside the gate of a grand hall named "Qingxin Hall." "Go inside, the Sect Master and the others are waiting for you there."

Chu Ning paused slightly upon hearing this. "Are the Stewards not coming in with me?"

"The Sect Master only called for you to enter, not us," Liao Yunming interjected with a smile. Chu Ning nodded upon hearing this and stepped into Qingxin Hall.

Inside the hall, which was dozens of feet in size, there were only a few people present. Xin Wuya sat in the center, flanked by the green-robed Elder Yang, whose hair had completely whitened, and the silver-haired Elder Mu. Below them were the dark-faced Elder Zhu and the red-robed Elder Gui, who had previously been injured and left. Clearly, this elder had received the news and returned to the sect. What surprised Chu Ning was that Elder Tong, who had been mentioned earlier, was not present. He wondered if it was because his lifespan was nearing its end, so he no longer participated in such matters.

Besides these individuals, there was one more person: Mu Ling.

As Chu Ning entered the hall, everyone's gazes immediately turned to him. Chu Ning quickly walked forward and bowed. "Disciple Chu Ning greets the Sect Master and the Elders." Having gone through such events and roughly knowing why he was called, Chu Ning maintained a composed demeanor, though respectful, even under the gaze of several Core Formation cultivators. This surprised the Core Formation cultivators slightly.

Xin Wuya, now restored to his scholarly appearance, slowly opened his mouth. "Chu Ning, tell us what happened after you entered the spiritual domain."
