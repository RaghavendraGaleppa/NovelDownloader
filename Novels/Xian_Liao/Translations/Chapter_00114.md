# Chapter 114: Pioneering

Returning to the Jiangzhou medicinal garden with Zhang Jingxiu, Zhou Qing had already taken the three damaged storage pouches from the rogue cultivators to Yuan Mingyue for repairs to their formation patterns. They had now been fixed and returned to him.

Whoosh! A lightning-fast shadow darted toward Zhou Qing.

"Blood Python Snake."

Previously, Zhou Qing had fed the Blood Python Snake some Dragon Scale Vine, after which it had fallen into a long slumber. Unexpectedly, it had now awakened. The snake's demonic soul bore Zhou Qing's imprint, and he could even sense its emotions—full of dependence and submission.

The small snake was now only a foot long. Zhou Qing observed the newly grown scales on its body, crimson like coral, and the barely noticeable bumps on its head. Curious, he flicked his finger with a Diamond Finger technique at the snake.

"Eh?"

The snake hissed in pain but showed no signs of injury. Although Zhou Qing hadn't used his full strength, the attack was still formidable—even a third-level body cultivator would struggle to withstand it. Further testing revealed the snake's speed was nearly on par with Zhang Jingxiu's, and its defensive capabilities weren't far behind either. However, its small size—only a foot long—meant its strength couldn't compare to that of a Furnace Realm body cultivator, not even matching a third-level one.

"The biggest challenge of passing through the teleportation array is enduring the pressure and tearing sensation it imposes on the body. That's why Foundation Establishment-level cultivators are needed to withstand it. The true essence of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, combined with their physical body, provides sufficient defense. Furnace Realm body cultivators, with their robust physiques, can also endure it. My rooster, being a special breed, can pass through as well. Now, it seems this little snake might also be capable."

Zhou Qing still vividly remembered the formidable physical strength of the original Blood Python. The Blood Python and this Blood Python Snake represented two evolutionary paths. The snake's small size allowed it to concentrate more cultivation resources on enhancing its physical resilience, albeit at the cost of reduced size and strength.

Big has its advantages, small has its merits.

Moreover, the snake had consumed remnants of the Dragon Scale Vine and, after its long slumber, had clearly undergone new evolutionary changes.

According to the *Records of Strange Things*, a small venomous snake (虺) transforms into a flood dragon (蛟) in five hundred years, the flood dragon becomes a dragon (龙) in a thousand years, the dragon evolves into a horned dragon (角龙) in another five hundred years, and after another thousand years, it becomes a Yinglong (应龙).

The term "虺" refers to a small, venomous snake. Zhou Qing observed the faint bumps on the snake's head, wondering if they might grow into dragon horns. Regardless, the snake's potent venom would be highly useful. Thus, Zhou Qing decided to bring it along.

The little snake indeed passed through the teleportation array unharmed with Zhou Qing.

"Such rich spiritual energy," Zhang Jingxiu marveled, taking a deep breath. This was the kind of place befitting a great Furnace Realm cultivator like him.

At the same time, Zhang Jingxiu glanced around the empty cave dwelling, his expression turning odd.

"Zhou, you didn't even leave anything for me, your good friend? The cave is completely bare. Afraid I'd take something? I'm not like that shameless old fool Fusong."

Seeing Zhang Jingxiu's look, Zhou Qing retorted, "Some bastard cleared out everything before I got here. It was already like this when I arrived."

Zhang Jingxiu chuckled. "Sure, I believe you. Should we scout the area now?"

Zhou Qing nodded. "Let's not go too far—just within a few dozen miles."

Since the three rogue cultivators had explored this far, the nearby area couldn't be too dangerous. However, Zhou Qing knew the true threats in the Southern Wilderness weren't human cultivators but demons and other monstrous creatures. Thus, caution was paramount.

Leaving his rooster to guard the cave, Zhou Qing opened a gap in the defensive formation. Water rushed in but was quickly drained by the cave's built-in drainage array. The two men surged through the gap, their bodies enveloped in protective barriers that repelled the water. Such water-repelling techniques came naturally to Furnace Realm body cultivators.

Zhang Jingxiu even adjusted the shape of his true essence barrier to better navigate the water.

Once outside the underwater dwelling, they looked back to see only darkness. In the waters around them, even an ordinary black fish was several zhang long, its mouth filled with sharp teeth.

After swimming upward several hundred zhang, they broke the surface.

Zhou Qing surveyed the surroundings—endless water stretched in all directions, with the nearest shore far in the distance. Through his Insightful Eyes, he could see towering mountains lining the shore, their peaks seemingly piercing the clouds.

"This isn't a lake—it's practically an ocean," Zhang Jingxiu exclaimed, awestruck.

The distant shoreline looked like a coastline. Zhou Qing shook his head. "Let's not head to shore yet. We'll explore the nearby hundred-mile radius of water first."

Such vast waters provided natural concealment. Any battles underwater would be less likely to draw attention.

Diving back down, they descended over a hundred zhang. Visibility was poor, but Zhou Qing's Insightful Eyes allowed him to see far, and his spiritual sense extended three hundred zhang underwater (and up to a thousand zhang above). The deeper they went, the more taxing it was on his spiritual sense, but he persisted—this was good training.

A six-to-seven-zhang-long black fish was feeding, its massive mouth swallowing schools of smaller fish and shrimp, water gushing from its gills.

While cultivating spirit herbs in the underwater dwelling, Zhou Qing used the bones, tendons, and hides of demonic beasts hunted by Zhang Jingxiu in the nearby waters to forge magical instruments.

Zhang Jingxiu was sharp—he knew a hundred-mile radius was the safe limit. Venturing beyond risked encountering unknown dangers.

Zhou Qing's forging skills improved during this process. With the successful creation of a pair of communication fish talismans, he checked his Health Master panel:

**Basic Forging Technique (Proficient).**

"Not easy," he mused.

"These fish talismans are magical instruments I forged based on the communication array Yuan Mingyue deduced. Within a three-hundred-mile range, you can contact me anytime," Zhou Qing said solemnly, handing one to Zhang Jingxiu.

Zhang Jingxiu took it without a hint of gratitude. "So all this forging effort was just to push me to explore beyond the hundred-mile radius sooner?"

Zhou Qing coughed. "Well, if you'd prefer, you can handle the forging and herb cultivation while I explore."

Zhang Jingxiu: "..."

He was paying the price for focusing too much on martial prowess!

Back at Qingfu Palace, Fusong cheerfully complained to Fushan, "Don't be fooled by how impressive Zhang looks following Zhou around. All he's good for is hunting grunt work."

Great deeds required proper justification. For now, their priority was leveraging their strengths—hunting, gathering cultivation resources, and nurturing more talents for the Dao Court in the mortal realm.

---

"Feng Xiu." The orphaned disciple of the Immortal Mist Sect, brought out by Chang Wanli, was a rare talent—skilled in both scholarly and martial arts.

"Greetings, Elder Zhou." Feng Xiu had been training at Qingfu Mountain on Zhou Qing's orders. Given the vast gap in their status, he rarely had the chance to meet Zhou Qing in person. He never expected Zhou Qing to seek him out.

Zhou Qing smiled. "You've progressed quickly with the Bear Roar Golden Bell Art."

"Elder Fusong has been very attentive to my training, offering frequent guidance. With Elder Fushan's elixirs, I've been able to advance rapidly."

Zhou Qing nodded. "Cultivation depends on both perseverance and talent. A disciple like you deserves focused nurturing. Your current skills aren't quite ready for the first World Martial Arts Tournament, but are you willing to take on the challenge?"

Feng Xiu hesitated briefly before nodding firmly.

Zhou Qing smiled. "I'll teach you two martial arts. With two years until the tournament, if you master them, you might not win first place, but reaching the top four is possible. However, the tournament is a life-and-death arena. One misstep could be fatal. Are you afraid?"

Feng Xiu: "I am."

Zhou Qing: "Then why participate?"

Feng Xiu: "Fear of death is human nature. It fosters reverence for life but doesn't mean cowardice. One must act with greater caution and clarity. The arena is deadly, but once you step off, no further harm can come. Staying calm ensures you can leave alive. Moreover, martial arts can't reach greater heights without facing life-and-death trials."

Zhou Qing: "You're raw jade, in need of polishing."

Among Qingfu Palace's disciples, Zhou Qing was particularly satisfied with Feng Xiu. They had a connection dating back years.

Zhou Qing taught him the Shadowless Kick and a self-created Spirit Crane Sword Art.

"Shadowless Kick emphasizes speed and explosive power, but its essence lies in being 'shadowless.' If you can strike like a ghost, you'll have achieved minor mastery. Remember—Shadowless Kick is first ghost, then human."

"I understand."

Zhou Qing then explained the Spirit Crane Sword Art's intricacies—its agility and swiftness complemented the elusive footwork of Shadowless Kick perfectly. Combined with the Bear Roar Golden Bell Art's formidable strength and defense, Feng Xiu, with ample resources, could easily surpass Fusong in his youth.

With his mindset, surviving life-and-death battles would temper his spirit, making him a quasi-Innate seed. Success, however, still depended on luck.

Meanwhile, Fushan, Fusong, Xiao Ruowang, and Yuan Mingyue progressed steadily with the aid of potent elixirs. However, Zhou Qing lacked sufficient pill formulas.

Fushan specialized in pill-making, using demonic beasts and monsters as primary ingredients to develop new formulas. As the Dao Court expanded in the mortal realm and spiritual energy revived, ancient pill formulas and techniques occasionally surfaced in abandoned cultivator dwellings.

Tang Jieyuan had finally accepted Zhou Qing's recruitment, leading a team of scholars to decipher ancient texts on pill-making and techniques. These scholars, uninterested in wealth, were compensated with life-nourishing pills.

With resources flowing, the Dao Court flourished.

After handling administrative matters, Zhou Qing returned to the underwater dwelling. Though spiritual energy was reviving in the mortal realm, it paled compared to the underwater dwelling, where Zhou Qing felt at ease.

He began planting spirit herb seeds—obtained from the spirit stone mine where Xuan Qingzi's cave was—in the dwelling's garden. Zhang Jingxiu hunted nearby, using a storage pouch repaired by Yuan Mingyue. These pouches couldn't hold living beings or souls but could store herbs.

Despite the dwelling's richer spiritual energy, herb cultivation remained slow. "We'll need demon cores to speed it up," Zhou Qing mused.

Actively seeking demons in the Jingyang Dao Domain was risky—their power was unpredictable. Instead, Zhou Qing planned to capture weaker demons from the mortal realm, test their ability to endure the teleportation array, and bring them here for cultivation.

He suspected the four demonic sects might be using similar methods to nurture demons.

Another thought crossed his mind—could the Great Mulberry Tree be transplanted here? For now, it remained in Jiangzhou, guarding the teleportation array. Though the mortal realm seemed safe, the tree was an extra layer of security.
