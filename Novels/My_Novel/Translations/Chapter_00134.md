Chapter 134: The Lady Feeds Him Fruit, A Perfect Physique!

Lady Wen’s beautiful eyes rippled with emotion, her gaze fixed entirely on Li Xian. Such heroic bearing, such imposing aura—even the young heroes, scions of noble families, and heirs of powerful sects she had seen in the past were far inferior.

She had already witnessed the first arrow, filled with spirit and will.

Lady Wen loved hunting in the mountains and was no slouch at archery. She knew better than most how difficult it was to infuse an arrow with spirit and will. It required the oneing to to.

Lady Wen loved hunting in the mountains and was no slouch at archery. She knew better than most how difficult it was to infuse an arrow with spirit and will. It required the complete unification of one's temperament, intent, and state of mind.

Archery skill is easy to train, but spirit and will are hard to find. Even those sitting high in the imperial court, reaching the pinnacle of power, can be cowards. Even those with formidable martial strength, ruling over their own territories, can be timid.

A person's level of achievement has nothing to do with spirit and will. However, one who is high-spirited and full of ambition, if they encounter the winds of fortune and transform into a dragon, will surely amaze the world.

Spirit and will reach their peak.

And to shoot an arrow imbued with spirit and will while facing an army of ten thousand pressing down upon you is even more difficult! The aura of ten thousand soldiers is overwhelmingly mighty, like a surging great river.

Facing a great river head-on, one person's spirit and will is as tiny as a speck of dust. It would be washed away in an instant. In such a situation, an archer's temperament, intent, and state of mind would surely be affected.

Even if by a hair's breadth, they would not be able to shoot a stunning arrow.

That first arrow made the Lady turn her head in admiration. Though her own strength was formidable, she admitted to herself she could not have shot such an arrow.

"One arrow pierces ten thousand soldiers, one arrow seeks the enemy's throat. A youth holding a golden bow, his spirit and will soaring to the heavens.

"One arrow pierces ten thousand soldiers, one arrow seeks the enemy's throat. A youth holding a golden bow, his spirit and will soaring to the heavens. This Li Xian, without realizing it, has already reached such a level of elegance. The Great Ancestor of Great Wu, who started as an archer, must have had a similar heroic aura in his early years!"

"To have found such a youth, my luck is truly helping me. Good, very good."

Lady Wen had a cool and detached nature, but she held a particular reverence for the Great Ancestor of Great Wu.

A man's heroic bearing should be reflected in his archery, and today she had witnessed it. This kind of heroic bearing deeply moved her.

For the second arrow, she borrowed Li Xian's spirit and will, using her own power to shoot it. With that, a mere commander of the Yellow Dragon Army could not escape death.

One arrow, one kill.

Li Xian ordered the guards to collect the weapons of the defeated soldiers and bind them all. He then sent someone to notify County Magistrate Lin Guolong within Qingning County.

The Yellow Dragon Army had a vast number of troops. It was inevitable that some would escape, but it was no longer significant.

"Commander Li, the casualty count is ready." Ding Hu was covered in wounds, his body wrapped in bandages.

"We lost fifty-one guards and one hundred and seventeen tenant farmers..."

He reported the casualties one by one.

Li Xian nodded and said, "The wounded will be treated for their injuries. As for the dead... I will report to the Lady and request compensation and comfort for their families."

With Qi Biao of the Yellow Dragon Army dead, the morale of the troops was shattered. A total of over twenty-one thousand defeated soldiers were captured. The Harmony Manor could not hold so many, so they needed to hand them over to Qingning County as soon as possible.

Reporting this matter would bring another significant military merit. It would likely benefit that Lin Guolong.

After dealing with all these matters, the sky had already darkened.

Li Xian rubbed his shoulders, feeling a great wave of fatigue. But he knew the Lady must be waiting for him in the inner courtyard. Gritting his teeth against the exhaustion, he headed for the inner courtyard.

Outside the manor, there was a storm of blood and gore, but inside, it was clean and tidy. The Yellow Dragon Army had come quickly and been defeated just as fast.

Passing through a small path in the woods, he saw a rockery and a stream. Li Xian scooped up some stream water and splashed it on his face, washing away his weariness and drowsiness.

He arrived at the gate of the inner courtyard.

Composing his mind, he pushed the door open.

In an open-air pavilion, he saw Lady Wen reclining on a jade couch. Her thin silk dress seemed to both conceal and reveal, her long legs crossed one over the other. Her toenails were painted with red polish, decorated with plum blossom patterns. On the table in the pavilion were placed cherries, lychees, candied fruits, osmanthus cakes... and other delicate pastries.

A mist of water surrounded the area, adding a touch of coolness.

Her long hair was let down, some of it draped over her shoulders, some falling onto the jade couch.

She was deliberately waiting for Li Xian.

"Li Xian."

"Although you rendered a great service with your archery, I must still punish you. Do you know why?"

Lady Wen's voice was soft and gentle, yet it carried an air of authority. She looked him up and down, her gaze quickly fixing on Li Xian's face.

The air outside reeked with the stench of blood. Here, however, it was filled with a faint, elegant fragrance, tranquil and comfortable, like a fairyland.

"Is the Lady blaming me for not burying the roads and moving the trees? I could have avoided the Yellow Dragon Army. It was my failure in this matter that invited this disaster?" Li Xian asked.

Lady Wen nodded slightly. "You are clever. Since you already know, why didn't you do it?"

Li Xian said, "Lady, I did indeed fail in my duties. I am willing to accept any punishment you see fit. However, I did indeed carry out the plan to bury the roads and move the trees to hide our tracks. But a vile person interfered and added complications."

"Oh?" A sharp light flashed in Lady Wen's eyes. "Tell me the details."

Li Xian immediately recounted the entire story of Xu Liefeng, from beginning to end: how they had become enemies in Qingning County, how Xu Liefeng had coveted his position, and how he had used a borrowed knife to kill.

Upon hearing this, Lady Wen said coolly, "That so-called Leopard Blade Sect... I spared his life once, yet he still doesn't know how to stop. How laughable." A moment later, she changed the subject. "It seems that during my seclusion, you have already manifested your Transformed Physique."

Li Xian thought to himself: *I have two physiques in one body, the red mole on my brow is impossible to hide. But my my dual pupils of can can I can conceal them at will, she priorit Lady her interest is paramount, her cultiv cultivating me for her own own benefits. I must seek her own schemes, her schemes me be. my own, otherwise otherwise otherwise, otherwise I would definitely surely dead to dead.*

 the she was her, She Lady Wen smiled, her fingers playing with Li Xian's bang. She looked at his young, handsome, vibrant face, filled said, "You are the [Perfect Physique]. No wonder."

 it's makes sense."

"

"Perfect Physique? What kind of physique physique Please Please Lady tell me, Li Xian asked.

Lady Wen did not hold back in her explanation. "It is a very diverse type of Transformed Physique. For example... look at this teapot."

She casually picked up the teapot from the table. It was the size of a palm, made of black basket stone, with an exquisite appearance, carved with dragons and phoenixes.

Pouring hot water over it, the carvings on the teapot seemed to move, dragons and phoenixes dancing together, as if they had come to life. It was truly magical. With an elegant motion, she poured out the tea and asked, "What do you hear?"

Li Xian listened carefully. "When the teapot pours, I can hear a strange sound, like a phoenix cry or a bird's song. It is melodious and wonderful."

Lady Wen smiled. "Good, look more closely." She raised the teapot, and the stream of water arced through the air into the teacup.

,..,...,.., X,.,.,. The teapot is the same, but different teapots produce significantly different results."

"A mud pot is ugly in appearance and may even leak. The tea it pours will have a muddy, earthy smell. Even the finest tea leaves, when steeped in such a pot, are a complete waste. Thus, it is useless."

At this point, Lady Wen thought of Pang Long, then looked at Li Xian and continued:

"A porcelain pot is slightly better; it can at least hold water. But the tea it pours is intermittent and sluggish. It's the kind used by servants."

"Above that are teapots with some craftsmanship and technique. When pouring tea, the water flow can be continuous. But still, it's hard for them to catch my eye."

"A fine teapot has an exquisite body and delicate craftsmanship. When pouring tea, the water column is cohesive and does not scatter, and it produces a strange sound."

"An even better teapot, like this one, not only has a strange sound but can also produce a strange phenomenon. No matter how you tilt it, the water flows out like a phoenix cry, but lands silently."

Lady Wen continued, "Martial artists are like teapots. If your teapot is good, the strange phenomena will naturally be more pronounced when you perform your martial arts. Just like this teapot, it pours out mist and creates the image of fish and birds playing."

"The so-called [Perfect Physique] means that after a martial artist washes away their mud body, their physique is exceptionally perfect, like the most finely crafted teapot. Therefore... their martial arts are more powerful, and it is easier to manifest strange phenomena."

"Even among the finest teapots, there are distinctions in quality and differences in appearance."

Li Xian suddenly understood. "Lady, are there many people with the Perfect Physique?"

Lady Wen shook her head. "Very few. People have thousands of different physiques. The [Transformed Physique] is the manifestation of one's true form, which then exhibits certain characteristics. However, these characteristics can be good or bad. To enjoy the benefits, one must endure the drawbacks."

"The Perfect Physique cannot be considered the most powerful [Transformed Physique], but its characteristics are all positive benefits, making it something martial artists desperately seek. Some martial artists' [Transformed Physiques] are extremely powerful in certain aspects, yet inferior to others in different aspects."

"People are like teapots. The moment they come out of the kiln, their quality is already determined."

"In a county's porcelain kiln, strange and unusual utensils are common, but a truly perfect teapot, even if its appearance is ordinary, may not appear once in decades or even a century. People are even more so. To be able to manifest the [Perfect Physique] is something to be proud of."

Li Xian said, "Lady, your knowledge is vast and profound. I admire you."

Lady Wen smiled meaningfully. "I dare not say I can recognize all the ten thousand phenomena under heaven. I know a great deal about the [Perfect Physique] because..."

"I also possess the Perfect Physique."
