# Chapter 78: Alone

Qin Ming exhaled slowly, thinking of all the past events; it felt like a surreal life. Yet, they were all real experiences. A tightness seized his chest, and a whirlwind of thoughts churned within him. He gripped his mutton-fat jade iron blade, trying to calm his emotions.

"Calm down." He sat back down, trying to maintain his composure. From childhood until now, though less than twenty years had passed, his past had been sufficiently convoluted and complex. A common youth might have been driven to collapse by such a life.

Qin Ming revisited those past details, aiming to preempt future risks. He needed to analyze the characters and methods of those people. For these matters were far from over; not long ago, Father Cui and Mother Cui had still intended to keep him confined in a remote region.

"Grandpa Fifth Cui always smiled, and it was he who encouraged me to persist in practicing the Silk Book, advising me not to touch any other New Life arts. While it seems beneficial to me now, at the time, it was meant to block my path to advancement." Qin Ming remembered asking Father Cui and Mother Cui for their opinions, and both had agreed with Grandpa Fifth Cui.

However, when Cui Chongxuan coveted the Silk Book and wished to practice it too, Father Cui reprimanded him, saying that one person practicing this art was enough, and promised to find him the equally terrifying "Six Control Heart Sutra." Qin Ming also wanted to examine the Six Control Heart Sutra, but Father Cui calmly looked at him and asked in return, "Do you not have confidence in yourself and the Silk Book?"

By the time Cui Chongxuan was nearly thirteen, he had already undergone three 'New Life' transformations under the guidance of his elders, and had begun consuming tri-colored flowers and merging four kinds of Sky-Light energy. Qin Ming recalled that he had already noticed various anomalies back then, but having lived together for many years, he was unwilling to attribute malicious intent to his relatives.

Everything had been foreshadowed. From childhood, the Cui family had never stinted on praising him, which had often attracted assassination attempts. Qin Ming clearly remembered that each time the Cui family dealt with an expert who had approached him, their first reaction wasn't worry for him, but immense joy. Father Cui and Mother Cui were both very calm, showing no tension or lingering fear over his dangerous encounters. Afterwards, they would always praise the experts who had exerted themselves, hoping to eliminate as many people with ill intentions towards the Cui family as possible.

Evidently, the Cui family, in Qin Ming's current view, was like a towering mountain reaching into the clouds.

"My Silk Book is still there." Putting everything else aside, he had to retrieve that book. Not only was it the only item left by his grandfather, but it also held the key to his future path. The Silk Book was incomplete, largely burned, but it must have retained certain emotions, as it carried the painstaking efforts of several old predecessors. Qin Ming could obtain the complete Silk Book through resonance.

The Cui family—he was destined not to avoid them. He would certainly have to go to Qinghe City. However, retrieving the Silk Book, he wondered how many more disturbances it would cause.

"Two years ago, during the great clash between the Cui and Li families, the Cui family must have suffered a blow to their vitality, but they should recover quickly." Clearly, the Li family suffered greater losses. This was because the Cui family primarily deployed elders who already had only a few years left to live. They were fearless in death, targeting the Li family's promising young talents, fighting fiercely to cripple the Li family's future. Qin Ming had personally witnessed the madness of those old men, which also showed their strong sense of identification with the Cui family. He couldn't help but sigh, this was the profound heritage of a thousand-year-old aristocratic family, incredibly difficult to shake. Especially, in that Otherworldly Realm, many experts belonged to aristocratic families. Even if a thousand-year-old family declined, it was difficult for them to completely fall, unless their clansmen in the Otherworldly Realm also 'collapsed' entirely.

"In the past, there were bloody lessons that deterred the various royal courts." After Qin Ming regained his memories, he was naturally no stranger to the affairs of aristocratic families. A long time ago, a thousand-year-old aristocratic family was annihilated by an incredibly prosperous dynasty. However, in the end, someone emerged from the Otherworldly Realm, re-establishing that family, and the dynasty itself mysteriously declined and was eventually brought to an end.

Qin Ming suddenly realized that not only was the Cui family dangerous to him, but there was also an exceptionally powerful Li family, already capable of challenging the status of a thousand-year-old aristocratic family. At this moment, he felt a tightness in his chest again. These were supposed to be the Cui family's enemies, none of his business, yet he had been passively drawn into it.

The feathered-robe youth, Li Qingxu, had almost killed him; this matter definitely could not end well. In fact, based on Qin Ming's understanding of Li Qingxu's character, the other party would certainly not let him off. "His animosity towards me is not shallow; when did it begin?" Qin Ming frowned, pondering. After careful consideration, he believed it was related to his engagement with the Wang family's direct daughter. Li Qingxu seemed to have known that noble lady for a long time.

"My life these past ten-plus years, could it get any unluckier? Life is nothing but a facade—abandoned, dying, made a scapegoat, and finally to be confined to a remote place, forbidden from embarking on the path of New Life..." Qin Ming took a deep breath, then forcefully exhaled a large mouthful of stagnant frustration.

Engagement to the Wang family's direct daughter—what did that have to do with him? It was a marriage alliance between the Cui family and the Wang family. His impression of that girl was merely that she was exceptionally beautiful and loved to smile; he had never truly gotten to know her in depth. The Wang family's direct daughter was indeed very intelligent and adept at handling affairs; this was the impression Qin Ming got from their sole outing together. But afterwards, he was severely reprimanded by Father Cui, who warned him to observe propriety, avoid suspicion, and not to make private contact again.

Undoubtedly, Li Qingxu's intense hostility towards him stemmed precisely from so-called "romantic resentment," coupled with the conflict between the two great families, and perhaps also the thought of eliminating a future rival in the Otherworldly Realm early on.

"You should go find the real Cui Chonghe!" At this moment, Qin Ming really wanted to emulate Xu Sheng's forthright female friend, Zhou Lin, and continuously spew obscenities.

A long time later, he calmed down. What he was most worried about now was his grandfather. Over a decade had passed; how was he doing? Qin Ming frowned. When the Cui family initially sought "Cui Chonghe," they must have carefully selected, believing he was the most suitable, as some in the manor had said the two bore some resemblance. His grandfather was just an ordinary person. If the Cui family had set their sights on him, the old man wouldn't have been able to resist in any way.

Now the Cui family forbade him from setting foot in Qinghe City again, nor could he return to his original circle. He wanted to inquire about his grandfather's whereabouts, but it was impossible to ask the Cui family directly. He could only do so through other channels.

Qin Ming stood up and walked out of the inn. He hadn't originally planned to go to the City Lord's Manor, but now he had no choice but to make the trip. The new City Lord, Meng Xinghai, had once said that he could seek him out if he came to Chixia City.

In the early morning, the entire city glowed splendidly. The first rays of fiery dawn dispelled the dark mist, and the streets and alleys seemed to shimmer with morning light, giving a sense of warmth, brightness, and hope.

It was still quite early, so Qin Ming found a restaurant for breakfast. "Hmm?!" As he paid the bill and prepared to leave, he noticed a scene that made his heart subtly skip a beat.

The old woman of the Sun family carefully took money from her bosom, bought a meat pastry, and handed it to her three-year-old grandson. A smile appeared on her wrinkled old face; her former melancholy seemed to have dissipated.

Two men suddenly approached. One of them said fiercely, "You have money to buy pastries, but no money to pay your debts?" The old woman was startled and said, "I don't owe you money."

"You're truly senile! You borrowed before, are you trying to default now?" One man shoved her, causing the old woman to lose her balance and almost fall to the ground. The other man grabbed her, not to prevent her from falling, but to directly rummage through her pockets.

"Alright, you're living well, you actually have some money!" He snatched all the copper coins from the old woman's person.

"Don't bully my grandma, let her go," the toddler cried.

"Get lost, little brat!" One of the men reached out to push him. An adult acting against a toddler would clearly cause the child to fall directly to the ground, possibly knocking out teeth. However, his hand didn't reach the child. It was suddenly seized by Qin Ming, who had appeared out of nowhere, causing the man to cry out in pain.

"What a sin, why do they always target the Sun family? Sigh, the old woman raising her grandson alone is already pitiful enough."

"Who is that youth, to actually stop the people of Xinyi Hall?"

People nearby whispered, not daring to intervene.

"Who are you, and why are you stopping us?" the Xinyi Hall man said coldly.

"These grandmother and grandson depend on each other and are already pitiful enough; you shouldn't bully them so much," Qin Ming said. He had already learned of their origins from the whispers of others—weren't they Xinyi Hall, who had schemed to seize the Sun family's secret manual? And now they were still committing evil.

He felt a strong sense of empathy. Because his own family possessed a Silk Book, it meant his ancestors had once been very powerful. Now, it wasn't just a decline in family fortunes, but it could be said they were completely ruined. Thinking carefully, his situation was even worse than Wu Zheng's, but similar to the Sun family's.

Qin Ming was originally heading to the City Lord's Manor because of his grandfather's affairs. Now, seeing this scene, he felt too deeply. He couldn't hold back, performing the Yellow Mud Palm for the second time, and then a third. The two men felt almost nothing as they were pushed away. In fact, they would cough up blood incessantly a few days later and would be unlikely to survive.

"Young man, quickly leave..." The old woman of the Sun family opened her mouth to say something, worried for him, hoping he would quickly depart.

Qin Ming said, "It's fine. Haven't you heard that the new City Lord has arrived? He personally annihilated Golden Rooster Ridge and is now set to deal with evildoers. If some people don't know what's good for them, they'll certainly face a bad end." He handed the little boy, whose face was stained with tears and whose small hand still clutched the meat pastry, back to the old woman.

"Stop trying to scare us!" The two men from Xinyi Hall blustered but were inwardly timid.

"You still don't believe me? Come, let's go to the City Lord's Manor to reason, and see if you can keep your dog lives!" Qin Ming sternly reprimanded.

"You..." The two men recoiled.

Qin Ming said, "Old lady, take your child home. Don't worry about anything. I still have matters to attend to and must go to the City Lord's Manor." He wasn't just speaking idly, nor entirely leveraging power. If he saw Meng Xinghai, he would absolutely mention these affairs in the city. He figured the new City Lord, upon assuming office, would be eager to make a strong statement.

The two men from Xinyi Hall were half-convinced, half-doubtful, and secretly followed him. When they discovered he truly went to the City Lord's Manor, their faces immediately paled.

At first, the City Lord's Manor guards were somewhat suspicious, but seeing Qin Ming's calm composure and extraordinary bearing, they dared not delay and went to report for him. After more than twenty days, Qin Ming saw City Lord Meng again.

"I thought you had gone to another city. Not bad, it hasn't been long since we last met, yet I observe that while your divine essence is reclusive, your overall spirit and vitality should be far more abundant than before." Meng Xinghai assessed him.

"Greetings, Uncle Meng. I had injuries before, and I've only recently recovered, which is why my spirits seem better." Qin Ming performed a junior's salute to him.

The living room was large, but not ornately carved and painted; it was rather rustic, displaying ancient artifacts like ceramic jars and bronze vessels, and some calligraphy and paintings hung on the walls. Meng Xinghai, dressed in green robes, looked to be in his late thirties, resembling a scholar, but was in fact very formidable, his blade techniques exceptionally sharp.

"You truly are no simple child. You came in and lit a fire for me, single-handedly overturning Golden Rooster Ridge." Qin Ming couldn't argue or conceal it, because Li Qingyue had seen him that night. "I've caused Uncle Meng trouble."

"Sit down, it's fine. The former City Lord Ling Xu and I both wanted to clear that place, but we wished to first lure out the Golden Thief." After Qin Ming sat down, he said, "I acted impulsively and disrupted Uncle Meng's plans."

Meng Xinghai smiled and said, "It's good to have a surge of passion. It's rare to have such a spirit. There are other ways to lure out the Golden Thief. I truly hope you can maintain this original nature, unlike some juniors who, despite extraordinary talent, well... sigh!"

"Since Uncle Meng puts it that way, I certainly won't let you down. Um, just now..." Qin Ming spoke directly, recounting what he had seen on the road. Meng Xinghai hadn't expected him to be so pure and unblemished, truly capable of acting on his words. However, upon closer thought, even if he was just an abandoned pawn, having undergone the "dye vat" influence of the Cui family, he couldn't possibly remain simple. In fact, he had already realized that this young man was remarkably mature, not like a naive youth.

"Since you have this intention, then help me with some matters. Investigate those situations, and if necessary, you may act. I grant you this authority." Meng Xinghai tossed him a token, surprisingly decisive. Then he asked again, "Tell me, what do you need me for?"

"I came to thank Uncle Meng for his assistance at the edge of the desert last time," Qin Ming said.

"Only thanking me?"

"And Qingyue. I know she must have spoken up for me," Qin Ming said with sincerity.

"Indeed, you were able to guess," Meng Xinghai nodded.

Qin Ming spoke, "This time, I also wish to trouble Uncle Meng to inquire about some information." Meng Xinghai listened quietly, then felt surprised. He wasn't asking about the Cui family's affairs; he only wanted to know where his grandfather had gone back then.

Meng Xinghai said, "You're really putting me in a difficult spot. Even if I were to ask for you, the Cui family probably wouldn't tell me the truth. Unless I see that Old Seventh Cui, but he's most likely unreachable now, as he's already in the Otherworldly Realm."

"Don't you have any doubts about your experiences in the Cui family?" Meng Xinghai couldn't help but ask.

Qin Ming sighed, "I did before, but now I understand. There must be a true Cui Chonghe, and he is about to step forward into the limelight."

Meng Xinghai was surprised, saying, "No wonder some in the Cui family were uneasy about you. They feared your extraordinary talent, and that if you were to rise and learn the full story, you might harbor resentment towards them and cause trouble. They truly didn't underestimate you." He showed a strange expression, saying, "You are within the game, with limited knowledge, obstructed by mist, yet you can discern most of the truth. That is truly remarkable."

"Did I guess some parts wrong?" Qin Ming asked.

"Not exactly wrong, just that you don't know the full picture," Meng Xinghai didn't hide anything, explaining some circumstances while sipping tea.

Cui Chonghe wasn't voluntarily stepping forward; rather, his unusual circumstances were discovered by someone in the World Beyond. As he grew older, he increasingly resembled Father Cui. Most critically, someone detected that he had secret correspondence with the Cui family. "So, our appearances will be quite different when we grow up, only slightly resembling each other in childhood," Qin Ming mused inwardly.

"Furthermore, Cui Chonghe's teacher has emerged from seclusion. Even with the intricate web of forces in the Otherworldly Realm, no one dares to touch this son of the Cui family now."

"Is his teacher very powerful?" Qin Ming couldn't help but ask.

"Yes, it's said that Cui Chonghe's senior disciple brother had been teaching on behalf of their master before. That old senior had been in seclusion and has now successfully taken half a step forward. His cultivation is unfathomable. He has also formally accepted Cui Chonghe as his final, closed-door disciple, and will take no more students in the future, treating him as a precious treasure."

Qin Ming was silent after hearing this. The fortunes of people truly varied greatly.

"The Cui family forbidding you to return to Qinghe City, or to go to Thousand Star City, and even attempting to cut off your path to New Life, was indeed because the true heir had been exposed." Meng Xinghai informed him that the Wang family in Thousand Star City was very angry and extremely displeased that the Cui Chonghe they had previously met was actually fake, and they too had been kept in the dark.

Qin Ming gave a wry smile. The Wang family wouldn't hold a grudge against him too, would they?

"Cui Chonghe himself was also somewhat displeased. He learned of your outing with the Wang family's direct daughter. Indeed, someone in the Otherworldly Realm witnessed him losing his temper around that time."

Qin Ming truly felt like drawing his blade now. Why? All parties reached a reconciliation, and in the end, all the problems and suffering landed on him alone.
