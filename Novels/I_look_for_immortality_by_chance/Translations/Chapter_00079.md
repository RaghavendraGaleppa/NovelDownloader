# Chapter 79: Golden Talisman, Death

"Boom!"

A deafening explosion echoed through the cavern as dazzling arrow shadows tore through everything before silence returned.

Gu Yuan looked down at Yun Hanxiu lying at his feet, her body covered in blood, his expression indifferent.

The violent arrow shadows had ripped through Yun Hanxiu's abdomen, leaving a gaping hole where her dantian had been—a gruesome sight. Yet she still clung to life.

"Cough, cough, cough!"

"You... you also had a Golden Talisman... Of course, with your experience as a raider, you'd have a backup plan."

"But you... you should have killed me outright!"

"A true raider... would never hold back..."

Despite her grievous injuries, Yun Hanxiu's face was flushed with excitement, her beautiful eyes fixed intently on Gu Yuan, as if dissatisfied with his restraint.

Gu Yuan remained silent, merely using his magic power to summon a black jade slip from Yun Hanxiu's sleeve.

Under normal circumstances, Gu Yuan would have shot Yun Hanxiu dead without hesitation, showing no mercy.

But the Stone Liquid had revealed that the opportunity in this cavern was illusory, not a physical entity. Drawing from his experience at Silverfish Island, Gu Yuan speculated that such opportunities might serve as catalysts, leading to other hidden fortunes—much like his encounter with Sword Fox Sage on Silverfish Island.

Considering Yun Hanxiu's earlier words, Gu Yuan suspected this might be related to a Body Seal.

Thus, he held back slightly, not killing her outright but merely shattering her dantian and dispersing her magic power.

"Whoosh!"

Gu Yuan's eyes shimmered with a peculiar golden light as he examined the black jade slip.

The slip was protected by intricate Dao patterns, but these seemed to guard only against spiritual sense, not spiritual sight. With eyes sharp as lightning, Gu Yuan easily identified the nodes in the patterns and, with a thread of magic power, dissolved them effortlessly.

"Hummm..."

The black jade slip trembled faintly, its ink-like darkness gradually fading to reveal a hint of pearly white.

Simultaneously, a voice echoed in Gu Yuan's mind:

"Keh keh keh! Future junior, I don't know who you are, but you're in luck!"

"The Three Hearts Seal and all my treasures are hidden in the Yunlan Secret Realm of Zhongshan Kingdom. If you want them, go and claim them!"

The message ended there, but a mysterious map materialized in Gu Yuan's mind, pointing to an enigmatic location.

"The Three Hearts Seal?"

After transmitting this message and the map, the jade slip crumbled into dust.

Gu Yuan looked down at the barely breathing Yun Hanxiu and asked, "The Three Hearts Seal that triples comprehension, akin to a Three-Aperture Exquisite Heart—the legacy of Three Methods Daoist, the profound Body Seal your Yun family has sought for over twenty years?"

Yun Hanxiu's eyes locked onto Gu Yuan as she answered without hesitation, her voice weak but clear:

"Three Methods Daoist was a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator one hundred and fifty years ago, the most formidable raider in the Ba Kingdom. He plundered over a hundred times in his life, amassing countless techniques and immense wealth."

"His final raid was an ambush on the direct disciple of a Golden Core master from Luoxia Mountain, aiming to seize resources for his own ascension to Golden Core."

"It was the most uncertain raid of his life, so he hid his most precious seals and techniques beforehand, leaving clues scattered among raiders."

"This jade slip is one of three maps he concealed."

"With it, you can seek out the Three Hearts Seal!"

As she spoke, a glimmer of anticipation flickered in Yun Hanxiu's eyes, her black-and-white pupils gleaming brightly.

"I can go with you!" she suddenly added, her voice tinged with excitement. 

"Together, we could become the greatest raiders! Three Methods Daoist was mad and eccentric—only I understand his thinking!"

"We could be the Twin Fiends! Do you like women? I can be yours! I can even help you capture many, many women for your pleasure!"

"Though it's a shame you didn't kill me outright, you're still the most decisive and powerful raider I've ever met. You can dominate me—I'll submit to you!"

Her body trembled with excitement, her face flushed as if lost in some delirious fantasy.

Gu Yuan couldn't help but frown.

This woman was truly bizarre.

Raiders really were all lunatics.

"Thud!"

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan summoned his Peach Sword Seal and drove it through Yun Hanxiu's forehead.

"Guh—"

With a final shudder—whether from pain or ecstasy—Yun Hanxiu's breath stilled.

---

Looking at Yun Hanxiu's corpse, still strikingly beautiful even in death, Gu Yuan sighed and summoned his Flame Dragon Seal, reducing her body to ashes.

Yun Hanxiu had been the strongest Qi Refinement cultivator he'd encountered since entering the mountains—and the most deranged.

Though her raider techniques had been countered by his own, her methods had still been formidable.

Especially that final Golden Talisman—it had contained a sliver of Foundation Establishment power. Had Gu Yuan not spent seven hundred spirit stones to acquire a similarly potent talisman before entering the mountains, Yun Hanxiu might have escaped.

"That single strike cost me nearly seven hundred spirit stones. If not for this discovery, it would've been a massive loss."

Gu Yuan glanced at the now-dim golden talisman in his sleeve, a wry smile tugging at his lips.

Four days earlier, after hearing Qiu Mingshan's lecture at the Personnel Hall, Gu Yuan had rushed to Moon Bamboo Market to bolster his strength, determined to leave nothing to chance.

The market had been bustling with cultivators buying weapons and talismans, but the Golden Talismans—imbued with a trace of Foundation Establishment power—were the most sought-after.

In this world, talismans were considered a minor path.

Because cultivators couldn't channel spiritual energy directly—they needed to rely on seal techniques.

To create a talisman, one had to imprint the Dao patterns from a seal onto special paper. But the resulting talismans were weak and limited.

Ever since the True Immortal ascended to the Heavenly Palace, the materials capable of bearing such power had grown increasingly rare, causing the talisman path to decline.

Only Foundation Establishment-level Golden Talismans retained some efficacy, but even these were only marginally stronger than top-grade magical artifacts—and difficult to counter.

A skilled cultivator could endure their effects and retaliate, but if used well, they could turn the tide in an instant.

At the time, Gu Yuan already had enough top-grade artifacts, but with many vying for Golden Talismans, he had bid seven hundred spirit stones to secure one as an emergency measure.

And it had proven its worth—without it, Yun Hanxiu would have teleported away.

"Wealth, companionship, techniques, territory... No wonder wealth comes first."

With a sigh, Gu Yuan collected Yun Hanxiu's storage pouch, exited the cavern, and ascended to the mountain peak.

There, he sat cross-legged and activated his formation disk.

Killing was merely a means—claiming the spiritual peak was the true goal.
