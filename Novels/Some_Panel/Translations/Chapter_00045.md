## Chapter 45: I Am Your Senior Brother, Li Changxiao

Three Nascent Soul True Monarchs halted, standing at the forefront. They did not rush forward, but instead surveyed the vast underground world. At the same time, Yang Ji was also observing. As his gaze swept across, various pieces of information appeared.

[Level 1 to 10, Floating Worms: Capable of instantly releasing blinding light.]
[Level 1 to 10, Ancient Coiling Trees: Can merge their branches to form tree spears, extremely powerful piercing ability.]
[Level 1 to 10, Demon-faced Mushrooms: Can devour human souls.]
[Level 1 to 10, Blue Yin Grass: Hallucinogenic.]

"Good heavens, have all these plants become refined spirits?" Yang Ji inwardly clicked his tongue. Fortunately, none of them seemed overly powerful; they shouldn't pose much harm to the group. Nevertheless, he subtly glanced at Man Biao and the others, warning, "These plants look a bit strange. Be careful."

"These mushrooms are indeed peculiar. I keep feeling like it's staring at me," Man Biao frowned, approaching a mushroom taller than himself and examining it curiously. Unbeknownst to him, strange patterns flowed within the mushroom cap, silently weaving together into a ghost face. The ghost face was inside the cap, but its ghastly eyes swiveled, revealing a ferocious glint, as if it could see Man Biao beneath the mushroom's umbrella.

These plants were somewhat mystical, seemingly breathing in unison with the earth itself. Their spiritual energy fluctuations were exceptionally well-hidden, so much so that Man Biao, a Core Formation True Man, didn't sense anything amiss. Even the three Nascent Soul True Monarchs hadn't pinpointed the exact problem, only sensing an abnormality, which made them hesitate to advance.

At this moment, seeing the mushroom's ghost face fixed on Man Biao, Yang Ji reached out to warn him. But just then, the lurking ghost face on the mushroom cap floated out like a wisp of green smoke, opening its hideous mouth and viciously biting Man Biao's head. No external wounds appeared, no blood splattered, but Man Biao let out a startled cry, his soul feeling as if it had been stung. However, he reacted quickly. His body trembled, and protective true qi burst forth, instantly shattering the ghost face biting his head into spiritual particles.

"Damn it, this mushroom bit me?!" After a moment of puzzlement, Man Biao's face turned ashen. Mumbling curses, he swung his axe backhand, splitting the mushroom in front of him into two halves.

"Be careful, these plants are problematic!" The three Nascent Soul True Monarchs gazed at Man Biao, instantly discerning the issue. It was at this moment that countless floating worms drifting in the sky suddenly erupted with a dazzling flash of light. Everyone's vision turned into a blank white, instantly unable to see anything. The next moment, the Ancient Coiling Trees, Demon-faced Mushrooms, and Blue Yin Grass moved in unison, launching a deadly assault on everyone in that instant.

In his information perception, a ghost face transformed into a wisp of green smoke and lunged towards his head. Already prepared, Yang Ji remained unhurried. Earth Spirit Fire extended from his fingertips, forming a fiery tongue that coiled around the ghost face, instantly incinerating it into ash. Simultaneously, an Ancient Coiling Tree nearby drew its sharp branches together, forming a spear that jabbed towards his heart. Executing the Flowing Water Sword Art, Yang Ji's flying sword thrust forward fiercely. The sword tip met the tree tip like needle against awn, and with a clang, the flying sword ultimately proved superior, causing the Ancient Coiling Tree to recoil in pain.

In his perception, the others also remained unpanicked. There were very few Qi Condensation cultivators among those who had come down; most were Foundation Establishment cultivators. Aided by the warnings from the three Nascent Soul True Monarchs, everyone displayed exceptional combat prowess. With successive strikes, they either repelled or slew the Ancient Coiling Trees and ghost faces. After five breaths, the world cleared. Everyone looked around and discovered that the surviving Ancient Coiling Trees, Demon-faced Mushrooms, and Blue Yin Grass had pulled themselves from the ground and scampered away. The Floating Worms also gathered into a cluster, whistling as they flew into the distance. These creatures' escape looked rather pathetic and comical, yet also somewhat infuriating.

"Everyone, be careful. This place is strange. So many refined demon-beasts, yet they were hidden so well," Chi Huo True Monarch frowned slightly.

"Let's go, we continue forward!" Nan Kui True Monarch took the lead, walking ahead. Without the obstruction of those plants, their journey was smooth, but soon, something else blocked their path. A stone forest, where thick, identical stone pillars stood like chess pieces across the ground. Yang Ji looked at it: [Stone Formation, defensive formation.]

"Defensive formation?" As he murmured, he saw Nan Kui True Monarch rise into the air and launch a punch forward. An enormous spiritual energy fist shone brightly, carrying incomparable force as it slammed into the stone forest. However, with a hum, a translucent protective barrier rose from the stone forest, completely nullifying his attack. Nan Kui True Monarch's brows furrowed instantly upon seeing this: "There's a protective restriction; my attack is useless against it."

"There was a spatial restriction outside, and now a defensive restriction here, both far exceeding the power range that Nascent Soul True Monarchs can handle. We don't know what kind of powerful cultivator resides here. Fellow Daoists, do we proceed or retreat?" Chi Huo True Monarch asked, glancing sideways.

"If a powerful cultivator truly resides here, and their cave abode was destroyed by an earthquake, they surely wouldn't remain indifferent," Nan Kui True Monarch said, looking sideways at Ling Gu True Monarch. As Ling Gu True Monarch pondered, he stepped forward, bowed, and called out, "Ling Gu of Canglan Sect requests an audience with Senior!"

"Nan Kui of Nanyuan Sect requests an audience with Senior!" Nan Kui True Monarch also stepped forward, bowed, and called out. Chi Huo True Monarch likewise stepped forward, calling out, "Chi Huo of Evergreen Sect requests an audience with Senior!" Behind them, seeing this, the others also bowed slightly in salute. While bowing, Yang Ji continued to gaze forward, his eyes piercing through the [Stone Forest]. However, he found no information indicating the presence of a powerful cultivator, nor any signs of danger. He, however, remained silent.

Thirty breaths passed. The three Nascent Soul True Monarchs slowly rose, exchanged glances, and then condensed spiritual energy avatars, walking towards the stone forest. Boom! The stone pillars suddenly came alive, beginning to move rapidly and chaotically, constantly blocking the path of the spiritual energy avatars.

"This is an auto-triggered formation; once someone steps onto that land, the formation activates," Ling Gu observed for a moment, then said, "Fortunately, it's merely a defensive obstruction without any attacks. This might just be a gate, meant to prevent people from intruding into the forbidden area behind it. It seems this powerful cultivator is also a benevolent person."

"What about those strange plants that attacked people? How do you explain them?" Nan Kui frowned.

"Those should just be indigenous plants living underground. The reason they could all become refined spirits is likely that the senior who once resided here used a special method to enlighten them, using them as guardians," Ling Gu speculated.

"I think so too. This powerful cultivator's strength must be immense; if they were to truly raise guardian creatures, their power wouldn't be so low," Chi Huo promptly stated. "In that case, let us delve deeper into the stone forest. This stone forest is in a chaotic state, without any discernible pattern. We'll have to find our own way through; whether we can enter depends on our individual fortunes."

"When spiritual energy avatars move forward, the stone pillars block them, but when they retreat, the pillars automatically make way. There should be no danger inside this stone forest; everyone can give it a try," Ling Gu said, and then he, along with Nan Kui True Monarch and Chi Huo True Monarch, stepped into the stone forest. The crowd behind exchanged glances and then also stepped into the stone forest. After a moment of thought, for safety's sake, Yang Ji still subtly told Man Biao, "Follow me!" Man Biao paused, then followed. The stone pillars within this stone formation constantly shifted. Everyone needed to find a path through the moving gaps to pass through the stone forest. Often, when one person had passed, and the next tried to follow their footsteps, an adjacent stone pillar would shift to block them. It was like scanning tickets for a high-speed rail: one person, one ticket to enter the station. However, those quick enough could pass two for one. Now, seeing Yang Ji go first, Man Biao could only follow closely behind him.

Just about three breaths after everyone entered the stone forest, a rumbling sound echoed from the path behind them. Everyone looked back, their expressions instantly changing. "It's demon-beasts! I didn't expect them to see the sky-piercing spiritual light and try to come in for a share."

"There are Demon Kings among them!" Everyone was greatly startled to see three masses of black demon qi swirling towards them from the front. Only Demon Kings could transform into a mass of demon qi and fly. Without hesitation, everyone immediately rushed towards the front of the stone forest; otherwise, encountering these demon-beasts would mean a fierce battle. The demon-beasts from behind surged forward, and under the command of the Demon Kings, they also charged headlong into the stone forest.

Yang Ji looked at the information display: [Left], [Right], [Left], [Forward]. The path was clear, and he quickly rushed out of the stone forest. However, Man Biao, distracted for a moment halfway through, became trapped within the stone forest. As the demon-beasts surged in, a great battle erupted within the stone forest.

Just as Yang Ji was observing. Whoosh! A black scorpion the size of a millstone, perhaps due to sheer luck, suddenly burst out of the stone forest and, with lightning speed, swung its tail barb towards him.

"It's a Level 10 Black Water Scorpion!" Yang Ji's gaze narrowed. Not daring to be careless, he swiftly raised his sword to block, instantly executing the Flowing Water Sword Art. A sword vortex formed, directly fending off the large scorpion's tail barb. However, the immense force transmitted from it still caused him to stumble back two steps. Clang, clang, clang! The Black Water Scorpion attacked relentlessly, its tail barb like a long spear, continuously assailing Yang Ji. For a moment, Yang Ji was on the defensive, constantly being pushed back. He was secretly surprised, "This Level 10 demon-beast is truly formidable. Even using the Flowing Water Sword Art, I can only hold my ground, and I'm still at a disadvantage."

At once, his eyes flashed. No longer hesitating, he unleashed his Fire Elephant Sword Intent. With a single sword strike, sword qi swept forth like a raging wildfire, engulfing the Black Water Scorpion. A pained shriek followed, and in an instant, it was shredded into pieces by the sword qi.

Just then, a white-robed man burst out from the nearby stone forest. He was handsome and unrestrained, with spiritual light flickering in his eyes. Seeing Yang Ji slay the Black Water Scorpion with a single sword strike, he first froze, then an inexplicable smile appeared on his face. The young man before him was actually a Core Formation True Man. Yang Ji, seeing the [Interested] tag above his head, couldn't help but frown inwardly. No sooner said than done, after flashing a grin at Yang Ji, the man attacked with his sword. Yang Ji was startled, preparing to block, but Man Biao suddenly burst out from the stone forest. Seeing someone attacking Yang Ji, rage instantly surged within him, and he charged with his axe.

"Dare to harm my brother? You're seeking death!" The man raised an eyebrow, glanced at Man Biao, and his flying sword moved sharply, instantly slashing out a burst of sword light that sent Man Biao flying back. Man Biao's face was filled with horror, his heart sinking in dismay: "This fellow is incredibly strong! I couldn't even withstand one of his sword strikes. Who is he?"

The moment Man Biao made his move, Yang Ji had already retreated. But the man, having sent Man Biao flying with a single sword strike, seemed unwilling to let Yang Ji go, launching another sword attack at him from mid-air. "Why is this guy attacking me?" Yang Ji was utterly bewildered. Feeling the sharp edge closing in from behind, his expression changed, and he had no choice but to turn and parry.

"Use your strongest sword strike to block, or you'll die by my sword!" the man shouted. Yang Ji roared furiously, his entire body erupting with sword qi. In an instant, he unleashed his Fire Elephant Sword Intent; the dominant sword qi swept forward like an overwhelming tide.

"Indeed, it's the Gui Zang Sword Art!" Seeing this, the man blocked the incoming sword qi with a single stroke, then stood holding his sword. He then grinned at Yang Ji and called out, "Junior Brother!"

"Junior Brother?" The call left Yang Ji bewildered. However, seeing that the man no longer harbored hostility, he couldn't help but sigh in relief. Frowning, he asked, "Senior, who are you?"

"Senior?" The man was startled, then laughed nonchalantly, "I am your Senior Brother, Li Changxiao!"
