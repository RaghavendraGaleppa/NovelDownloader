# Chapter 21: The Spirit Stone Mine

During his days in Pingyang City, Qin Chong had noticed something unusual—the number of Qi Refining stage cultivators in the city had increased significantly. 

Though he had never ventured out for training before, Qin Chong had frequently visited Pingyang City ever since his cultivation hit its first bottleneck, hoping to find a solution. Over time, he had become familiar with the regular cultivators in the area. The sudden influx of unfamiliar faces suggested that news of the Canglong Valley's recruitment of Qi Refining cultivators for the Cangwu Mine had already spread.

For major sects, mining spirit stones was one of the least desirable tasks for their disciples. After all, sect disciples received a fixed monthly stipend. Mining was not only laborious but also poorly compensated, and delving deep into underground tunnels carried inherent dangers. As a result, the higher-ups of Canglong Valley had gradually shifted their strategy.

Within Canglong Valley's sphere of influence, a significant portion of the resources for rogue cultivators and minor cultivation clans came from the sect's low-level tasks.

Soon, the day of assembly arrived. Early in the morning, Qin Chong headed to Canglong Valley's outpost in Pingyang. Located at the northern edge of the city, the outpost occupied a vast area, with a quick turn leading directly to the northern city gate.

A square several dozen zhang wide was already crowded with nearly a hundred Qi Refining cultivators. Most were at the mid-stage of Qi Refining, with only a few at the early or late stages. Early-stage cultivators lacked the stamina to work long hours in the mines, making them inefficient, while late-stage cultivators often preferred to venture out for spirit herbs or hunt demonic beasts, hence their low turnout.

After surveying the crowd, Qin Chong registered with the Canglong Valley disciple in charge and received a small black wooden token.

"Group C, Number Twenty-Three!"

This meant he had been assigned to the third squad, ranked twenty-third.

The bustling crowd gradually quieted as the cultivators bound for the Cangwu Mine assembled. Suddenly, several powerful auras swept over them, and the cultivators fell silent. Seven or eight Foundation Establishment cultivators emerged from the main hall, including two at the mid-stage.

After a brief discussion, one of the Foundation Establishment cultivators summoned a Flying Dragon Boat and announced, "All members of Group A, board this vessel."

Hearing this, those with "A" tokens quickly leaped onto the boat, which then transformed into a streak of light and flew toward the city gates. Due to the large number of participants, the groups had to depart in batches.

Soon, it was Qin Chong's turn. However, his heart sank slightly when he saw the leader of his group—fortunately, he had been suppressing his cultivation, or the situation could have been awkward. It was none other than Huo Qiang, whom he had met just days before.

"Oh? The Qin Family sent you on this mission?" Huo Qiang seemed surprised to see Qin Chong.

"Greetings, Senior Huo," Qin Chong replied. "The Qin Family has limited resources, and I was the only suitable candidate."

"Good. Gaining some experience will benefit you. I had a pleasant conversation with your father last time, so you can rest assured I'll look after you on this journey."

"Thank you, Senior Huo."

Internally, Qin Chong scoffed. *Pleasant conversation? More like squeezing benefits out of my father. Otherwise, he wouldn't be acting so friendly.*

Huo Qiang's Flying Dragon Boat was much larger than Huang Fei's from before. Even with thirty-six cultivators aboard, it didn't feel cramped, and its speed was significantly faster. When Huo Qiang loaded the spirit stones, Qin Chong noticed he used mid-grade stones—nine at once—a luxury no Qi Refining cultivator could afford.

The speed was so great that the gale-force winds would have been unbearable had Huo Qiang not immediately activated the boat's defensive barrier.

Once underway, Huo Qiang and two late-stage Qi Refining disciples from Canglong Valley stood at the bow while the rest sat toward the rear. After a while, some cultivators rose to peer over the sides, and since Huo Qiang didn't object, others followed suit. Clearly, most had never ridden such a high-grade flying vessel or traveled so far, making the experience novel.

For Qin Chong, this was also his first long-distance journey. However, he had studied maps of Yan Province extensively and could even guess their flight path, so he didn't join the sightseers.

After more than ten days of flight, they finally reached the Cangwu Mountains.

In the current cultivation world, the greatest sources of spiritual energy were spirit veins and spirit springs, with the former being a grade higher. Spirit veins were classified into supreme, upper, middle, and lower grades, though upper-grade veins were already rare. Rumor had it that Yan Province had only one upper-grade vein, occupied by the Chiyan Sect, while the Qingxuan Sect and Canglong Valley each held a middle-grade vein.

Typically, an upper-grade spirit vein would be surrounded by several middle-grade veins, while middle-grade veins would be accompanied by lower-grade ones. Remote lower-grade veins were usually claimed by prominent families, and minor clans would settle near spirit springs. The Qin Family, being a bottom-tier clan, had neither.

Spirit stone mines were formed when spirit veins exhausted their energy and fractured into prismatic stones. The Cangwu Mountain mine was said to have once been a middle-grade vein, making it one of Yan Province's largest, though it had been exploited for many years.

Decades ago, the Qingxuan Sect and Canglong Valley had fought bitterly over this mine, suffering heavy losses that left them far behind the Chiyan Sect. Eventually, they realized continued conflict was pointless and reached a compromise: each sect would control the mine for sixty years at a time, extracting as much as they could. This allowed both sects to recover somewhat, though the seeds of hatred were hard to erase.

The entrance to the Cangwu Mine lay beneath Cangwu Peak, an imposing mountain said to have once housed a powerful sect that vanished when the spirit vein depleted.

At the foot of the peak stood several interconnected courtyards—the miners' quarters. As the five Flying Dragon Boats descended, the waiting Canglong Valley disciples greeted them. The Foundation Establishment cultivators exchanged pleasantries before the new arrivals were divided into groups and assigned lodgings.

Qin Chong was led to a side courtyard with three neat rows of stone huts. The attendant disciple informed him that he could rest for the first three days to recuperate before experienced miners would guide him underground.
