# Chapter 38: Profound Yin Eye, Kirin Origin  

At the Grand Hall of Deliberations, Foundation Establishment cultivators were also discussing Lin Yun's free distribution of high-grade primary talismans.  

"Elder Sect Master, this Lin Yun has gone too far!"  

"Handing out high-grade primary talismans like candy to those lowly Qi Condensation disciples—what a waste!"  

"Exactly, Elder Brother Sect Master! If we follow his plan, that's over a thousand high-grade primary talismans—nearly two thousand! Just given away to those Qi Condensation disciples! It's an utter disgrace!"  

One after another, Foundation Establishment cultivators urged Zhong Lingdao to confiscate Lin Yun's talismans.  

"Gentlemen, if you want them, go claim them yourselves. They're free, after all," Zhong Lingdao said calmly.  

"However, if anyone here is thinking of forcibly taking them, I must warn you in advance."  

"Those talismans in Lin Yun's possession weren't made using materials from the sect's Talisman Hall. He procured the materials himself through the Chen Family and crafted them personally."  

"He spent his own spirit stones."  

With that, Zhong Lingdao stood and left.  

Truthfully, his heart ached as well.  

But what could he do? The Chen Family hadn't even raised an objection—how could he intervene?  

Meanwhile, at the Chen Family estate, the family head reported the matter to their Ancestor.  

"Ancestor! That Lin Yun is utterly detestable! He'd rather give those high-grade primary talismans to random Qi Condensation disciples than offer them to our Chen Family!" The family head gnashed his teeth in frustration.  

Upon receiving the news, he had been stunned into disbelief. He simply couldn't comprehend Lin Yun's reasoning!  

Those thousand-plus high-grade primary talismans could have been sold for nearly a hundred thousand spirit stones!  

"Ancestor, that's a hundred thousand spirit stones!" The family head wailed in anguish.  

"All those precious spirit stones, just thrown away on those Qi Condensation disciples—what a tragedy!"  

"Enough! Silence!"  

"Look at yourself—where is the dignity befitting the head of the Chen Family?!" the Ancestor snapped irritably.  

Chastened, the family head immediately shut his mouth and stood meekly to the side.  

The Chen Family Ancestor was also puzzled. He couldn't fathom why Lin Yun would do such a thing.  

"Could it be dissatisfaction with our family over past incidents? Is this some kind of test?"  

The Ancestor racked his brain but found no answer.  

"Where is Qiaoqian?" the Ancestor asked.  

"Qiaoqian has made rapid progress in her cultivation and has already reached the peak of Qi Condensation. She's now preparing to break through to Foundation Establishment." Speaking of Chen Qiaoqian, the family head puffed out his chest with pride.  

Though it had nothing to do with him, Chen Qiaoqian was, after all, his daughter.  

"So quickly?!" The Ancestor frowned in surprise.  

"If I recall correctly, the most talented of this generation in our family, Qiaotian, has only just reached the twelfth level of Qi Condensation."  

"Indeed, Ancestor. Also, according to the sect's assigned tasks, our Chen Family will lead the next expedition into the Bloody Forbidden Land," the family head replied.  

The Ancestor waved dismissively, uninterested in the matter.  

Originally, he had planned to send Chen Qiaoqian to probe Lin Yun's intentions, but now that she was in seclusion for her breakthrough, she wouldn't be available anytime soon.  

This made the Ancestor waver—should they continue investing in Lin Yun?  

After some thought, he decided to maintain their current stance. They would observe for now. Given past tensions, it was best to wait until Qiaoqian emerged from seclusion.  

"If he's giving away high-grade primary talismans for free, have our clansmen go claim some as well," the Ancestor instructed.  

"What? Us too?" The family head was disappointed. He had hoped the Ancestor would order him to "purchase" the talismans from Lin Yun—by force, if necessary.  

"Use your thick skull, you fool!" The Ancestor glared at him in exasperation.  

"If we provoke him now, won't we become a laughingstock? All our previous investments would be wasted!"  

"Moreover, this incident has only deepened my belief in Lin Yun's potential. Producing so many high-grade primary talismans in such a short time proves his mastery is still improving. It's only a matter of time before he becomes an intermediate talisman master."  

"We'll wait until Qiaoqian emerges before making any further moves."  

"Yes, Ancestor!"  

---  

The next day, Lin Yun's talisman stall remained bustling, with a long line of disciples waiting.  

**[Ding! Wang Tu has sent you a friend request.]**  

An eight-year-old child stood before Lin Yun, studying him with curious yet skeptical eyes. The boy seemed to think Lin Yun was out of his mind.  

Lin Yun simply let him pick a talisman without a second thought.  

**[Ding! Congratulations, host. You have obtained: Profound Yin Eye.]**  

**[Treasure Description: A pupil technique capable of cultivating the Frightening Divine Light, highly effective against all ghosts and malevolent spirits in the world.]**  

"Whoa—gold-tier loot!" Lin Yun barely contained his excitement.  

Just then, another person approached. Lin Yun narrowed his eyes.  

"Will you leave on your own, or should I have everyone here chase you out?"  

The man chuckled awkwardly. "No need, Senior Brother Lin. I was just joking."  

"I'll go, I'll go."  

Nie Ying, who had just arrived, witnessed the scene. "Huh? Why was that person driven away?"  

"Oh, him? He must've already claimed his share and tried to sneak back in. There've been quite a few like that lately," a nearby disciple explained.  

"I see." Nie Ying nodded. The Murong brothers had told her that each person could only receive one talisman per eleven individuals.  

This rule ensured fairness, allowing most disciples to benefit.  

"Lin Yun, just what kind of person are you?" Nie Ying rested her chin on her hand, staring intently at Lin Yun.  

As he handed out talismans, his smile was genuine—the kind that came from the joy of helping others.  

Nie Ying had never seen such a pure, selfless smile before. Lin Yun was the first, and she was mesmerized.  

Meanwhile, Lin Yun was indeed overjoyed—just not for the reasons Nie Ying imagined.  

**[Ding! Kong Hongfei has sent you a friend request.]**  

**[Ding! Congratulations, host. You have obtained: Gold Essence (1 unit).]**  

**[Treasure Description: A material forged from a Core Formation cultivator's core flame. Similar to Iron Essence, just 3.5 taens can elevate a magic tool's grade.]**  

**[Ding! Zhu Wenyao has sent you a friend request.]**  

**[Ding! Congratulations, host. You have obtained: Copper Essence (1 unit).]**  

**[Treasure Description: Another of the Five Metal Essences, with effects similar to Iron Essence and Gold Essence.]**  

**[Ding! Li Xiong has sent you a friend request.]**  

**[Ding! Congratulations, host. You have obtained: True Spirit—Kirin Origin (1 wisp).]**  

"Damn—now that's a legendary drop!" Even Lin Yun, usually composed, couldn't suppress his excitement.  

"Wait, how does something like this exist in the human realm?" He quickly grew suspicious. If this truly was the origin essence of a Kirin, he'd be set for life. But after reading the system's description, he nodded in understanding.  

**[Treasure Description: True Spirit—Kirin Origin. One of 100,000 divine fragments scattered when the True Spirit Kirin self-detonated during a great battle in the Spirit Realm.]**  

Lin Yun recalled a passage from the original story where Han Li encountered a crystal race woman named Xianxian in the Demon Mountain Range, who was symbiotically bound to a Kirin's divine fragment. Later, in the True Spirit's Lair, Han Li also met a member of the Dragon Clan similarly possessed by a Kirin fragment.  

The Kirin had scattered its divine fragments to reincarnate or possess hosts, scheming for its eventual return. It seemed one such fragment had somehow descended into the human realm.  

Studying the twelve-year-old boy before him, Lin Yun suddenly remembered a minor character from the original story—a Li family youth who had reached the ninth level of Qi Condensation by age twelve without consuming a single pill.  

"No wonder he advanced so quickly without pills," Lin Yun mused, stroking his chin. "Interesting. I wonder if this kid is possessed or symbiotic with the fragment."
