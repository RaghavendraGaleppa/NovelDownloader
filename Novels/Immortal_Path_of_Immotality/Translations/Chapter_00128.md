# Chapter 127: The Cunning Old Fox

After their reunion, Elder Gui even took out a table, chairs, and fine wine from his storage bag, inviting Lin Shan to sit down.

The two began drinking heartily in the courtyard, toasting and chatting merrily. 

Though it was clearly Lin Shan's cave dwelling, Elder Gui acted as the host, telling Lin Shan not to stand on ceremony and to make himself at home.

"Of course this is my home," Lin Shan thought to himself, inwardly scoffing. With the reinforcement panel as his safeguard, he confirmed the wine contained no "special ingredients" and was merely ordinary spirit wine before playing along.

Elder Gui appeared easy to fool but was actually as cunning as a fox. Whether Lin Shan was truly a disciple of the Purple Cloud Sect likely mattered little to the old man. His demeanor suggested he wanted to seize the nest like a cuckoo, using Lin Shan's name to evade enemies and recover from his injuries.

By controlling Lin Shan, all the spies and informants across the Shrimp Barbarian Sea would become useless, and Elder Gui's whereabouts would remain completely hidden. None of the searchers and surveillance teams would ever suspect their target was hiding right in their envoy's cave dwelling.

If Lin Shan was the local emperor of the Shrimp Barbarian Sea, this move was the cultivation world's version of "holding the emperor hostage to command the nobles."

Elder Gui's plan was brilliant—controlling a Qi Refining cultivator would only expose him, while controlling a Golden Core protector would be pointless. Taking control of a regional overseer like Lin Shan was just right.

As Lin Shan chatted amiably with Elder Gui, he realized he was effectively under house arrest. His mind raced for escape plans while secretly assessing the extent of Elder Gui's injuries.

After several rounds of drinks, Elder Gui began recounting his youthful adventures across the Eastern Sea, full of vengeance and heroics. 

Tales of underwater tomb explorations, ancient palaces ten thousand years old, terrifying solitary islands, and mysterious tribes unfolded, leaving Lin Shan and the Foundation Establishment youth wide-eyed with amazement.

Eventually, the conversation turned to Elder Gui's experience as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, when a Golden Core rogue cultivator had captured him and forced him to serve as a test subject for demonic cultivation techniques. Back then, he had cried to heaven and earth in vain.

When the two eagerly asked how Elder Gui had escaped, he avoided answering directly. Instead, he turned to Lin Shan with a smile while drinking.

"Seeing Nephew Lin reminds me of my younger self. Though trapped in danger, there was always something to rely on in my heart, facing all difficulties with calm."

Lin Shan's wine cup froze mid-air, his face showing uncertainty as he cautiously asked, "And now?"

"Just like back then!" Elder Gui's eyes gleamed sharply, his tone firm and pointed as he stared unblinkingly at Lin Shan.

Though inwardly shocked and suspecting Elder Gui had seen through something, Lin Shan maintained his composure, feigning contemplation. "Such a resemblance?"

Elder Gui gave a meaningful smile before resuming the drinking, and the three continued their merrymaking.

Half an hour later, Elder Gui suddenly coughed up two liters of blood mid-drink. Lin Shan and the Foundation Establishment youth were alarmed, the latter supporting his master anxiously.

"Master, are you alright? Shouldn't you rest and recover?"

Elder Gui waved off his disciple's hand drunkenly, squinting at Lin Shan. "No matter! Today, I celebrate reuniting with Nephew Lin—we drink until we drop!"

Lin Shan studied Elder Gui's complexion skeptically. "Uncle, your injuries seem severe. Perhaps you should rest."

Elder Gui laughed heartily, standing abruptly and slamming his cup on the table with bravado. "Those demonic sects are all worthless! Three years and they still couldn't touch me! These minor injuries mean nothing!"

Lin Shan remained expressionless, his eyes flickering as he covertly assessed the injuries while maintaining a concerned tone. "Uncle's indomitable spirit is truly admirable."

The Foundation Establishment youth beside them sneered, finding Lin Shan's flattery suspicious, oblivious that they were the intruders in Lin Shan's home.

Pleased, Elder Gui clinked cups with Lin Shan again. "Cheers!"

"Cheers!" Lin Shan raised his cup as usual, but as he drank, the seemingly tipsy Elder Gui suddenly flicked his finger, sending a white streak darting into Lin Shan's mouth before he could react. It shot straight into his dantian.

Horrified, Lin Shan immediately inspected his dantian with his spiritual sense and found a plump white worm clinging to his energy vortex. With a few quick bites, it burrowed into his "Mystic Pass Acupoint."

Lin Shan's face paled as he froze in place, dropping all pretense. "Uncle, what is the meaning of this?"

The previously drunken Elder Gui now appeared perfectly sober, stroking his beard with a smile. "The Acupoint Devouring Worm naturally feeds on cultivation barriers. It's now nestled in your next breakthrough acupoint. If not fed in time, it will consume your cultivation bottleneck."

"Without that passage, you'll never advance. Don't believe me? Try it."

Elder Gui smirked triumphantly. Without catching Lin Shan off guard, planting the worm would have been difficult—worth all his feigned camaraderie.

He had sensed Lin Shan's hidden confidence despite his fear, making him uncertain. But now, with Lin Shan's cultivation future in his hands, the young man was at his mercy.

As Lin Shan sat stunned, Elder Gui tossed him a small vial. "This is one day's worth of food for the worm. I have no more—each dose must be prepared fresh."

"Don't think of betraying me. Only I know the worm's feeding formula. Even if you summon the Black Lotus Sect or Purple Cloud Sect, they can't help you."

With that, Elder Gui swept his sleeves and left. His disciple sneered at Lin Shan before following his master into a hidden chamber.

As the door closed, a final taunt echoed out: "That Golden Core rogue cultivator was me. The test subject who resisted... well, let's just say his end was miserable. Hahaha!"

Left alone, Lin Shan frantically checked his dantian. The white worm had already taken several bites, destabilizing his cultivation foundation. Panicked, he opened the vial and swallowed the white mist inside.

The worm immediately stopped chewing and lazily absorbed the mist before curling up to sleep in his acupoint, carefree.

Lin Shan wiped his sweat, relieved but shaken. Since Elder Gui's ambush and the lethal formation's activation that morning, he had lost all initiative. His only trump card was mutual destruction—hardly ideal.

"Truly a cunning old fox of the Eastern Sea," Lin Shan mused. At just over twenty, he was no match for a centuries-old monster's schemes. 

Every master was once a novice, but in the path of immortality, one misstep could be fatal.

Silently leaving the courtyard, Lin Shan noticed the formation outside had dissolved—Elder Gui clearly didn't want to reveal his condition. 

"Go wherever you want," the message seemed to be. "The antidote is in my hands. If the demonic factions come knocking, your survival is your problem."

Lin Shan flew to the island's far side, carving out a new cave dwelling. Inside, he immediately began working on something urgent.

First, he had to break free from Elder Gui's shackles—or remain a pawn forever.

"That Acupoint Devouring Worm must be dealt with—fast."
