Chapter 17: To Kill a Man, First Destroy His Spirit

The funeral for the heir apparent of the Yu family was conducted with extreme grandeur.

Many people understood that given the current state of the Yu family, the death of the heir would bring about a massive upheaval. This was the topic most frequently discussed in private among the various guests.

Another figure who drew immense attention was the widow, Suo Chanzhi.

Clad in snow-white linen, with a pure and elegant countenance, the widow left a deep impression on all who came to offer condolences.

The young men, in particular, could not stop talking about the bride who had been widowed immediately after her wedding.

As the father, Yu Xinglong had few opportunities to appear at his son's funeral.

That evening, Yu Xinglong received the Third Steward, Yi She, alone in his study.

No one knew what Steward Yi said to the Clan Lord. The guards standing outside only heard a roar like that of a grieving beast, followed by the sound of a teacup smashing heavily onto the ground.

The meeting did not last long. After only about half an hour, Steward Yi quietly left.

However, the lamp in the study remained lit throughout the night until dawn...

The next morning, the Clan Lord, Yu Xinglong, invited several elders of the Yu clan to accompany him into the water dungeon.

These elders were all veteran figures from various branches of the Yu family. Their seniority was even higher than Yu Xinglong's, with one old man being two generations his senior.

They had rushed to Phoenix Mountain because they knew that with the death of the heir, there would surely be major family matters to discuss. Thus, they had come proactively without waiting for an invitation from the Clan Lord.

The water dungeon at Phoenix Mountain Manor had rarely held prisoners since its construction.

After all, it was extremely rare for someone to commit such a grave crime within Phoenix Mountain Manor as to be thrown into the water dungeon.

But now, two prisoners were held inside: one was the bandit, and the other was Leopard Head.

Leopard Head's hands were cuffed with iron rings to the stone wall, with most of his body submerged in the water.

The water was diverted from an underground river, cold to the bone year-round.

Even with Leopard Head's robust physique, he was already shivering with cold, his lips purple and his body numb.

By the light of the torches, Leopard Head's eyes widened as he saw the group filing in.

As a veteran who had served the main branch for thirty years, he naturally recognized these elders.

These old geezers had all come; it was even more complete than the annual ancestral worship.

Yu Xinglong's steward, Deng Xun, held a lantern and stood by the edge of the water dungeon, bowing slightly to prevent the elders from accidentally falling into the water.

He was about the same age as Yu Xinglong and had been the Clan Lord's study companion since childhood, earning his utmost trust.

After the elders had all passed by, Steward Deng straightened up.

He glanced at Leopard Head and gave a slight nod, then stepped forward to follow the Clan Lord.

Leopard Head understood the signal and his heart leaped with joy.

Following Yang Can's advice, as soon as he was brought up the mountain, before his freedom was restricted, he had immediately taken out his savings of many years and presented them to Steward Deng, whom the Clan Lord trusted most.

Steward Deng was fiercely loyal to the Clan Lord. If a matter was detrimental to the Clan Lord or the Yu family, no amount of money could buy his help.

However, as long as it was within the bottom line of Steward Deng's principles, and the benefits were in place, he was not stingy about putting in a good word.

Leopard Head did not ask for much; he only needed Steward Deng to mention the two intense conflicts he had with the Suo family on the way back to the manor in front of the Clan Lord.

Now, following normal channels, he could not escape punishment. With no way out, he could only follow Yang Can's advice and try to brand himself as someone who was at odds with the Suo family.

The nod Steward Deng had just given clearly meant that he had done as Leopard Head had requested.

But whether it would work, Leopard Head did not know.

Mr. Yang had said that if he wanted to truly clear his name, he ultimately had to wait for Mr. Yang to be summoned by the Clan Lord.

Leopard Head was now only worried that before the Clan Lord summoned Mr. Yang, he would already have frozen to death in this water dungeon.

The bandit, wrapped up like a mummy, had long since been broken by torture and had lost all his spirit. Such a thing relied on a single breath to hold out; once he gave in, he could not resist anymore.

As soon as he saw so many people enter the water dungeon, many of them white-haired elders, he knew they were important figures of the Yu family.

He now only wished for a quick death, so there was no need for further torture. He readily confessed everything.

When the bandit personally spoke the words, revealing that the mastermind who ordered them to kill the heir, Yu Chengye, was the head of the second branch, Yu Huanhu, the faces of the Yu family elders changed instantly.

They finally understood why the Clan Lord had invited them here. He was asking these elders to be witnesses.

Was the Yu family about to plunge into a life-and-death internal struggle?

The elders immediately became worried.

"I... I've confessed everything. I only ask for... a quick death. Please... give me a clean end," the bandit said weakly, the light of survival already gone from his eyes.

"Someone, unchain him and have him sign and fingerprint the confession," Yu Xinglong ordered calmly, though his face was ashen.

The Yu family guards answered and stepped forward to unlock the bandit's chains.

The moment the bandit was freed, he collapsed to the ground.

He sat on the ground, breathing weakly, his lifeless eyes fixed on Yu Xinglong.

Yu Xinglong's own lifeless eyes, glowing with a dim light, lowered slightly.

Seeing this, the bandit, whose eyelids were stiffened by dried blood, suddenly had his pupils light up.

He suddenly gathered all the strength in his body and let out a great roar, jumping to his feet.

The guards, thinking he had already lost the ability to move, were not on their guard.

Now that the bandit suddenly sprang up, the guards were greatly startled.

They worried that the bandit was going to attack the Clan Lord and the elders, so they immediately moved to block him. But after the bandit sprang up, he did not attack anyone; instead, he charged headfirst into a sharp corner of the stone wall.

The walls of this water dungeon were built with large blocks of bluestone, and the corners were extremely sharp.

There was a muffled "thud" of a heavy impact.

The bandit, his heart set on death, slammed into the wall with all his might. His skull instantly shattered, and his body fell to the ground with a "plop."

His body convulsed violently for a moment before falling still. But on his blood-stained face was a look of relieved release.

He was free, finally free.

As a death warrior, his mission was finally over.

The Clan Lord would take good care of his parents, wife, and children, ensuring they would want for nothing for the rest of their lives.

And all of this, he had bought with his life.

This bandit was actually a death warrior raised by Yu Xinglong. The other bandits who acted with him were part of a peripheral force also raised by Yu Xinglong.

All great aristocratic families had such peripheral forces that appeared to have no connection to the main family. When they encountered dirty work that was inconvenient for the family to handle directly, they would use these peripheral forces to resolve it.

This method of raising claws and fangs had existed since ancient times and had long formed a strict and mature operational system.

Even the leaders of the peripheral forces themselves might not know for whom they were actually fighting.

Yu Xinglong stood there as if he had not expected the bandit to commit suicide, completely stunned. The Yu family elders, however, secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

Dead was good. Dead meant no one to confront the accusation.

Although the bandit had confessed publicly, they were all witnesses.

But the bandit had not yet signed or fingerprinted the confession, nor were there any other witnesses or physical evidence to corroborate it...

In this situation, it was absolutely impossible to convict the head of a branch based solely on the verbal confession of a dead bandit.

Even if the person was the powerful head of the second branch of the main family, it would be impossible to confirm the crime. If it were just a branch head with little power, it would be even more impossible.

The elders secretly congratulated themselves. With this, perhaps they could avoid an open conflict between the main line of the main branch and the second branch.

They were not Yu Xinglong, who had lost his son in his old age. They considered the interests of the entire Yu family.

Internal strife within the Yu family was acceptable, but they absolutely did not want to see a life-and-death struggle.

The Sixth Master of the Yu family hurriedly stepped forward and said to Yu Xinglong, "Clan Lord, please restrain your anger. We have all heard what this man said. Everyone is a witness. Whether this bandit is dead or alive is of no great importance."

Yu the Sixth was an elder from a side branch of the Yu family. His presence here was solely due to his seniority.

However, at this sensitive moment, it was more appropriate for someone of little consequence like him to speak.

"Yes, Clan Lord. There is nothing more this bandit can confess. Whether he is dead or alive is of no great importance. Ahem!" Elder Yu the Second coughed twice and said, "However, whether his confession is true or false... it is hard to say. If it was truly Huanhu who did it, would he let a pack of dogs raised on the outside know he was the mastermind? There are still many parts of this story that don't hold up to scrutiny. Please be cautious, Clan Lord."

This Elder Yu the Second was also an elder from a minor branch of the Yu family. However, his branch still held considerable power within the Yu family, so he had a certain say.

Yu Xinglong clenched his fists, the muscles on his face taut with sharp angles, as if he could no longer control his agitation.

The elders watched, feeling a sense of shared sorrow.

The Clan Lord's line had never been very prosperous. The only one who had grown up and could share his father's burdens was Yu Chengye.

Now that Yu Chengye had been assassinated, Yu Xinglong was a white-haired man sending off a black-haired son. The fact that he hadn't gone mad in public was a testament to his immense self-control.

An eerie silence fell over the water dungeon, broken only by Yu Xinglong's heavy breathing in everyone's ears.

After a long time, Yu Xinglong suddenly turned and strode out.

The Yu family elders looked at each other. Without time to think, they hurriedly followed with their aged bodies.

They worried that the Clan Lord was going out to fight Yu Huanhu and had to stop him no matter what.

After Yu Xinglong turned away in indignation, the agitated expression on his face turned into a calm, sinister one.

That dear second brother of his, he would kill sooner or later, but not now.

The reason he had put on this show today was to create a bargaining chip, to take back, one by one, what Yu Huanhu had snatched from him.

To kill a man, he must first destroy his spirit!
