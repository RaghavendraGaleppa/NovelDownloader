**Chapter 49: This Is It**

Ding Rui's eyes were wide with surprise. He couldn't help but turn to Ma Yun and Ma Tu, asking with delight, "Seniors, may I ask what this hoe is?"

The Xuanfu Sect had no hoes because they didn't need them. Cultivators could perfectly and swiftly complete all tasks related to soil. Ding Rui was even certain that almost no cultivators in the Xuanfu Sect's spirit fields knew what a hoe was, and even he thought such a tool was impossible to find in the Huaqing Realm.

Ma Yun looked at the hoe and smiled faintly. "This was left here by a disciple from the Spirit Sword Sect who had a good relationship with us horse cultivators. It's an artifact he once used for farming, what was it called again?"

"It's called the Earth Qi Plow, and he used it to loosen soil," Ma Tu chimed in with a laugh, seeing Ma Yun struggle to recall the name.

"Right! The Earth Qi Plow!" Ma Yun immediately nodded, then quickly added, "That disciple from the Bashan Sect was named Tian Wang, and he was also a Spirit Farmer."

"Also a Spirit Farmer, an Earth Qi Plow used for loosening soil!" Ding Rui repeated these two points, his eyes looking slightly dazed.

"Indeed," Ma Tu continued. "After Tian Wang reached the Foundation Establishment stage and became an outer disciple, he joined the Miscellaneous Hall. He originally wanted to sell this plow or exchange it for some benefits within the sect, but it wasn't of significant use, so he couldn't easily offload it. So, he brought it to us and traded it for an equally useless formation. Out of consideration for our close relationship, we made the exchange."

However, Ding Rui naturally paid no attention to Ma Tu's subsequent words. His sole focus was on one sentence: Ma Yun's explanation that this Earth Qi Plow could loosen soil on its own simply by channeling the *Earth Qi Cultivation Art* into it!

Although the Earth Qi Plow was slower at loosening soil than a cultivator doing it by hand, making it largely unhelpful for other cultivators who needed to maximize their cultivation time, for Ding Rui, this Earth Qi Plow was undoubtedly a huge boon! As long as he mastered the *Earth Qi Cultivation Art*, he could completely save a skill slot dedicated to loosening soil by using this plow instead.

A little slower was fine; with his skill slots, he could use the Earth Qi Plow to loosen soil while simultaneously killing pests and weeding, without wasting any time at all. He knew that after mastering five cultivation arts, he would have to become a Spirit Farmer and manage his own spirit field. All the work in that field would need to be completed by him personally.

It was clear that the two horse cultivators were truly grateful for Ding Rui's stirrups and saddle, and they greatly admired him. So they spoke frankly, wholeheartedly wishing for Ding Rui to choose a better treasure. But Ding Rui naturally had no other considerations. While there were indeed many good and attractive items in this place, the Earth Qi Plow was definitely not the "best." However, the item that could offer him the greatest help, the one most suitable for him, was undoubtedly this Earth Qi Plow.

Ding Rui knew exactly how to choose. Of course, he couldn't reveal his true reasons. So, a thought struck him, and he came up with an excuse: "Actually, I'm quite similar to Senior Brother Tian Wang. I enjoy thinking about these peculiar things in my daily life. This Earth Qi Plow has given me much inspiration, and I need to study it carefully to see if I can create something even more useful from it!"
