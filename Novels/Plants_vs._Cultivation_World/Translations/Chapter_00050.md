# Chapter 50: Repairing the Array Disk

Though puzzled, Gu Mo refrained from asking questions—probing into others' secrets was taboo. Both Chu Feifei and Yao Shifeng had reached the second level of Qi Refinement, yet while Chu Feifei chose to conceal her advancement, Yao Shifeng flaunted his.

Didn't Yao Shifeng fear attracting unwanted attention? Or perhaps his fortuitous encounter was something he didn't need to hide.

Whatever the reason, Yao Shifeng had proven the value of their investment. Last year, the group had agreed to support him on the condition that he demonstrated results. Now, he had exceeded their expectations.

Accepting the group's contribution of 100 spirit stones, Yao Shifeng smiled faintly, though his excitement was noticeably subdued compared to the previous year. As a second-level Qi Refinement cultivator, his perspective had broadened. Once he reached the third level, the assistance these peers could offer would diminish. Still, their support remained crucial for now.

In return, Yao Shifeng shared insights into cultivation techniques and answered their questions. Gu Mo listened quietly, finding Yao Shifeng's explanations elementary—even spotting several mistakes. Through subtle questioning, Gu Mo pointed out these errors without drawing attention.

Yao Shifeng and Chu Feifei fell into deep thought upon hearing Gu Mo's queries, quickly recognizing the flaws. Hu Hai and Wu Jinfei, however, remained oblivious—a clear reflection of their lower cultivation levels.

"Gu Mo, excellent question!" Yao Shifeng's eyes gleamed after a long pause, having resolved the issue. As he prepared his response, Chu Feifei also looked up, having reached the same conclusion. Their reactions revealed Yao Shifeng's superior comprehension, though Chu Feifei's innate constitution held greater potential.

"Regarding this problem..." Yao Shifeng explained his findings with visible excitement, thrilled to have corrected a cultivation oversight.

"Let's conclude today's gathering here." Yao Shifeng stood, eager to reflect on his newfound insights.

"Wait for me, Brother Yao!" Wu Jinfei hurried after him, his competitive spirit replaced by a desire to curry favor now that Yao Shifeng had surpassed him.

"Gu Mo!" Hu Hai called out as Gu Mo prepared to leave, handing him a wooden box containing medicinal herbs. "A token of gratitude for the spirit rice. These herbs aid recovery—though I lack the skill to refine them into pills, they're still effective raw."

"Thank you." Though Gu Mo's Minor Revival Technique made the herbs redundant, he accepted them graciously.

"You're becoming more enigmatic by the day," Chu Feifei remarked after Hu Hai departed. Had she not known Gu Mo's background, his earlier questions might not have raised suspicion. But aware of his unusual nature, she suspected he had deliberately highlighted the errors to guide them.

"Shouldn't I say the same about you, Fairy Chu?" Gu Mo glanced at her, withholding comment on her concealed second-level cultivation.

"Then we're even." She smiled, unwilling to reveal her advancement like Yao Shifeng had—both to avoid discouraging Gu Mo and to maintain her own secrecy.

"How are the preparations for repairing the array disk?" Gu Mo changed the subject.

"I can begin now." Chu Feifei nodded. Over the past year, her high task completion rate had earned her the opportunity to study basic array repairs. Reaching the second level of Qi Refinement had further boosted her confidence in restoring Gu Mo's disk.

"Excellent!" Gu Mo was elated. A stronger protective array meant he could cultivate more Sunflowers. Even if each Sun Essence only equaled two days of cultivation, quantity would compensate for the reduced efficiency.

*This Gu Mo is definitely hiding his true strength,* Chu Feifei mused as she disembarked from his paper crane. Last time, he hadn't flown so effortlessly—clear evidence of significant progress. But since she too concealed her advancement, she let it pass.

Following Gu Mo through the illusion array, she was greeted by a lush spirit field. At first, she paid little attention—spirit rice was expected from a spirit farmer. Yet she soon realized these weren't ordinary Jade Spirit Rice. Though unfamiliar with farming, she recognized the plants' dense spiritual energy—likely first-grade superior.

The realization stunned her. She didn't know the difficulty of cultivating such plants, but in her Array Peak, only official array masters could craft first-grade superior formations. Gu Mo's skill now matched theirs.

"These are Water Spirit Rice. Repair my array disk, and I'll reward you with some grains," Gu Mo offered.

"Water Spirit Rice?!" Chu Feifei gasped. Renowned as one of the finest spirit foods for Qi Refinement cultivators—especially those practicing water-attribute techniques—it was unparalleled.
