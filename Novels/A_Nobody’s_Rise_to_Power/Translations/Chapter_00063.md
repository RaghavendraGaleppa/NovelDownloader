# Chapter 63: The Rose on the Spire

Bao Zitou had long been waiting outside the吊桥 (drawbridge) and welcomed Manager Qian into the manor.

When Yang Can first heard of this man's profession, he assumed he was a cruel and ruthless slave trader. Later, upon hearing his name, he pictured a greasy, vulgar merchant. But actually meeting Qian Yuan in person left Yang Can greatly surprised, for the man’s appearance was entirely unexpected.

Qian Yuan was extraordinarily tall, standing a full head taller than the already large Bao Zitou. His facial features were distinct, his eye sockets deep, and he had no beard beneath his chin. Most striking was the indigo-blue tattoo on one side of his face, with an extremely bizarre pattern. He wore a silk striped robe but was barefoot. It was a rather unorthodox style, neither purely Chinese nor Western.

Upon seeing how young the Manor Lord was, Qian Yuan was also slightly taken aback. At that moment, his two "perfume bottles" caught up. The two perfume bottles leaned against Manager Qian, one on each side, acting like clingy little birds. Qian Yuan laughed heartily, spreading his arms wide, the snake-shaped earrings beneath his ears shaking. Hugging the two "living perfume bottles," he said to Yang Can with a smile, "Manor Lord Yang, I have long heard of your great name."

*Achoo!*

As soon as the two "living perfume bottles" arrived, a strange fragrance drifted over. Little Qingmei felt her nose itch and couldn't help but turn her head to cover her mouth, letting out a sneeze!

Yang Can invited Manager Qian to sit down and said with a smile, "I have just taken charge of Feng'an Manor. As for servants, I need many. I hope Manager Qian’s visit will not disappoint me."

Seeing Yang Can get straight to the point, Qian Yuan couldn't help but laugh; he liked straightforward people. Manager Qian patted his chest and said heroically, "Rest assured, Manor Lord. As for the trade of servants, no one in Longshang can compare to me."

Qian Yuan immediately began enthusiastically introducing his business to Yang Can. "Just now entering this manor, I took a look. Your inner and outer courtyards—cooks, maids, servant women, pages, embroiderers, laborers, gatekeepers... For daily needs, you need at least fifty people. Do you want to buy them all from me?"

Yang Can nodded. "Exactly."

Qian Yuan’s eyes immediately lit up with joy upon hearing this. He had brought over one hundred and fifty slaves this time. If the deal went smoothly, he could sell a third of them in one go. This trip’s hardship hadn't been in vain.

Qian Yuan immediately clapped his hands and said excitedly, "Bring in our goods for the Manor Lord to inspect."

One of the "living perfume bottles" immediately walked out gracefully. Her swaying posture made Yang Can’s teeth ache. In no time, the handsome young man brought in a group of slaves. Each slave had a small tattoo symbol on their forehead. That was the exclusive mark of a slave. Even if you wore a hat or let your hair down to hide it, when passing through checkpoints, cities, or inns, you would be forced to remove your hat and lift your hair for inspection. Once the slave mark was discovered, you couldn't escape unless you were traveling with a master.

All powerful families had slaves; even moderately wealthy families had one or two servants. This was an era where slavery was still legal, a system maintained by the whole society.

Although Yang Can sat there watching, the selection was mainly done by Bao Zitou and Little Qingmei. Bao Zitou was responsible for selecting outer courtyard servants, gatekeepers, gardeners, and pages, checking their health and fluency of speech. Little Qingmei was responsible for selecting inner courtyard maids and servant women. Those who knew needlework or cooking were given priority. Currently, there was only one cook in the manor, and that was Chef Zhu, who cooked small meals for the Manor Lord... and her.

Batches of slaves were brought up. After screening, the selected ones stayed, and the rejected ones were taken away. Gradually, the personnel needed for the front and back courtyards were almost complete.

Manager Qian rubbed his smooth chin and suddenly smiled cunningly. "Manor Lord, with such a large manor, and with maids, servant women, cooks, and embroiderers now equipped, wouldn't you like to pick a few dancing girls and singers? They can play the jade flute and accompany you for some pleasure."

The two "living perfume bottles" beside him weren't just vases. As soon as Manager Qian started his sales pitch, they tactfully went to bring people in.

Yang Can declined politely. "I have just taken office as the Lord of Feng'an Manor and also serve as the Executive of the Main Branch. I am busy with official duties; how do I have the time..."

Before he could finish, his eyes lit up. After all, although they were close to the Western Regions, he hadn't seen many Europeans. Especially... one as beautiful as this.

Qian Yuan’s voice suddenly became magnetic, as if trying to hypnotize him. "Her name is Rehnabair. She was captured from a Persian caravan. Manor Lord, have you heard of the 'Medusa'? She is a female monster from the West. Legend says that whoever the monster gazes upon turns to stone. Look at her glass-like eyes; don't you feel petrified? Imagine her dancing alone for you under the quiet moonlight, twisting like a snake. In the candlelight, she looks at you with those enchanting Medusa eyes full of affection. She lies in your arms, with honey-colored skin and fiery red hair... People from her side speak with a trilling sound, faster than the fluttering of a bee's wings..."

Rehnabair stood stiffly there, glaring hatefully at the two merchants. Although she couldn't stand straight because her figure was a perfect S-curve. Her hair was red. Actually, in this era, there was a hierarchy of hair color discrimination in Europe. Black hair was considered a symbol of noble civilization, blonde second, and red hair at the bottom. So, this girl had always used black beans and other plant pigments to dye her hair the most noble black. However, the hair dye products of this era didn't last long. So, not long after she was captured, her long hair had returned to its original color. Rehnabair looked somewhat haggard, but her blue eyes held an unconcealed fury.

Manager Qian suddenly straightened his expression and raised his voice. "Such a beautiful woman, not a thousand bolts of silk, not five hundred bolts, but only three hundred bolts today. Is three hundred bolts expensive? Not at all! An ordinary female slave costs seven bolts, a needlewoman costs ten bolts! A beauty like Medusa can be used day and night, and I'm only asking for three hundred bolts. Only three hundred bolts! Such a beauty, you can use her for at least ten years, right? That's only thirty bolts a year. Three hundred bolts, you won't lose out or get tricked. Just nod your head, and she is yours!"

Manager Qian’s eyes were sharp. When selecting maids earlier, he noticed that the one in charge was the beautiful housekeeper, Qingmei. It was obvious that this beautiful housekeeper and her male master had an unspeakable story. Several female slaves who weren't bad were not selected by her. The only common point among those slaves was that they were relatively beautiful. This housekeeper clearly didn't want beautiful women appearing by her master's side. However, he really wanted to get rid this wildcat quickly. Because this little wildcat was too troublesome. In Xiazhou, a customer took a liking to her. Just as he was about to check her teeth, she pounced and almost bit his nose off, costing him a fortune. But he could only starve this woman for a few meals; he couldn't beat her because her value lay in her skin. She was goods, and he was a merchant who cherished his goods. Later, this bitch started playing the suicide card. She still had unhealed scars on her wrists from cutting herself with porcelain shards a few days ago. How difficult it is to be a slave trader! Transportation costs, supervision costs, food and lodging costs...遇上 (encountering) such a troublesome one, there are also accidental losses. The city lords don't need a toy that is tied up for one use and then thrown away; they want a tame female slave. But this wildcat is untamable, preventing him from selling her. For now, he has to fool this ignorant country bumpkin. Three hundred bolts of silk, actually, the price isn't low. In this era, ordinary servants cost only three to five bolts of silk. But beautiful female slaves could sell for two hundred bolts. There are records in Tang dynasty slave trade documents found in the Dunhuang area of beautiful female slaves selling for two hundred bolts of silk. This Manager Qian quoted three hundred bolts and is still saying it's a blood-curdling clearance sale.

However, Yang Can didn't need to be fooled; he was already tempted. *I need to learn a foreign language; I want to learn a foreign language too. It's good to learn one more skill.* But Yang Can wanted to maintain some dignity; that would make it easier to bargain, right? But just as he let out a reserved smile, Qingmei spoke.

Ever since seeing this woman with the bee-waist and rabbit-like hips, Qingmei’s alarm bells had rung. She immediately interjected, "Our Master is busy; how does he have the leisure to listen to songs and watch dances? Besides, does this foreign woman speak Chinese?"

Manager Qian smiled and said, "Don't worry, Miss. She grew up traveling with her family between the Western Regions. Persian, Sogdian, Tocharian, Khotanese, and Chinese, she is fluent in all."

*Huh? This girl knows more than one foreign language?* Yang Can was even more tempted.

Qingmei said with a straight face, "That won't do. Look at her fierce expression; she hasn't been properly trained yet, right? What if she accidentally bites our Master? Wouldn't that be paying for suffering?"

Yang Can glanced sideways at Qingmei. *We agreed we wouldn't take "crooked melons and split dates" (substandard goods). Is the melon in front of us crooked or split? I've fought all my life; can't I enjoy myself a little?*

Actually, even if this woman were as ugly as Wu Yan (a legendary ugly woman), Yang Can would still buy her. Just because Manager Qian said, "This girl was captured from a Persian caravan." Since he had stopped lying flat and could no longer lie flat, the road ahead was注定 (doomed) to be difficult. Since his rise was in Tianshui,难道 (难道) would he only choose to farm the land? This place was an important hub and must-pass point on the Silk Road! Commerce was an important part of his future layout. Especially since the most skilled in business among the Eight Warlords of Longshang was the Suo family. This resource could also be greatly utilized. In that case, a woman who had traveled between East and West with a caravan since childhood was like a tulip on a spire or a red rose in a castle—extremely valuable.

Yang Can coughed to signal, "Qingmei, I think this Rehna can stay."

Qingmei secretly hated it; *I knew it...* "Master, the silk in the storehouse might not be enough..."

Qian Yuan smiled and said, "Silk, spices, jewelry, gold and silver, tea, porcelain, any of those are fine."

Due to political division in Longshang, currency credit was insufficient. So, many scarce goods could serve as general equivalents, including slave trading.

Qingmei was still struggling. She felt that compared to this hot and sexy foreign woman, she was too green.恐怕 (恐怕) once this woman entered the manor, Director Yang wouldn't even look at her anymore. "Dancing girls, they usually come in pairs. You only have one. If people see this, they might think my family can't afford dancing girls, making our Master look shabby..."

Manager Qian was overjoyed; another hot potato was有望 (hopeful) to be disposed of. He immediately clapped his hands. "Come, bring in the Mirror Demon!"
