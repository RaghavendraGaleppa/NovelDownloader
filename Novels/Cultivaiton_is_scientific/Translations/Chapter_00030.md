# Chapter 30: Interrogation  

Li Shiming shook his head and took out several copper wires, connecting one end to the needles.  

He then positioned himself behind the bearded man, ensuring the latter couldn’t see his movements. The other end of the copper wires was drawn into his Machine Room Space and connected to the output terminal of an uninterruptible power supply.  

His actions intensified the bearded man’s pain, eliciting even louder screams.  

Li Shiming smirked coldly. With his consciousness, he manipulated the uninterruptible power supply in the Machine Room Space, sending a high-voltage current through the connected wires.  

The bearded man’s screams abruptly ceased—not because the pain had stopped, but because it had escalated to an indescribable level.  

High-voltage electricity, at least in the mortal world, had never been encountered before. The agony produced by connecting it directly to pain receptors was an experience no one in this world had ever endured.  

Li Shiming maintained the high-voltage current for only two seconds, but for the bearded man, those two seconds felt like an eternity in hell.  

When the current stopped, the bearded man was left gasping for breath, his body trembling uncontrollably. He cursed his own physical resilience—had he been weaker, he might have already passed out from the pain.  

At this point, he would rather die than endure that torment again.  

"I’ll talk!" he rasped through clenched teeth, barely managing to force out the two words.  

Li Shiming had been considering administering another shock, but the bearded man had already cracked under the first one. Without hesitation, Li Shiming pulled out all the needles embedded in the man’s body.  

He wasn’t worried about the man lying—official authorities wouldn’t be involved until the next morning, leaving him an entire night to extract the truth.  

Of course, removing the needles served another purpose.  

Li Shiming had retrieved several research papers on lie detection. Using his heightened senses and the computational power of the IBM z15 mainframe server, he could analyze the bearded man’s heartbeat, micro-expressions, pupil dilation, and other physiological responses to determine if he was lying.  

"My name is Pei Xinlu!" the bearded man gasped once he had recovered slightly.  

After giving his name, he carefully observed Li Shiming’s reaction, only to find no recognition in the young man’s expression. He had assumed Li Shiming was a martial artist—if so, he would surely have heard of Pei Xinlu, one of the Ten Great Masters of Zhongdu.  

"I was ordered by Lord Li Wenfeng to take your head," Pei Xinlu admitted without hesitation, too terrified to withhold anything after experiencing Li Shiming’s methods.  

"What position does Li Wenfeng hold?" Li Shiming asked, noting the respectful title of "Lord" used by the bearded man.  

"He is the Chief Steward of Prince Shun’s residence." Pei Xinlu had abandoned all resistance, answering every question truthfully.  

---  

Though Li Shiming wasn’t particularly familiar with the political landscape of the Great Xia Dynasty, he knew some key details.  

Prince Shun was the Third Prince and a major contender for the throne. The Chief Steward of Prince Shun’s residence held a third-rank position—though his actual authority might be less than that of the Prefect of Nanling, his official rank was two full levels higher. If Prince Shun were to ascend the throne, the Chief Steward’s status would skyrocket, potentially even securing a seat in the imperial cabinet.  

The name "Li Wenfeng" made Li Shiming think of his own father, Li Wenyuan. Both shared the same generational character in their names.  

"Keep an eye on him. We’ll report this to the authorities tomorrow morning," Li Shiming instructed his guards before leaving the room.

The next morning, the Court of Judicial Review took over the case. At his residence, Li Shiming received a visit from Vice Minister Hu of the Court of Judicial Review.  

"Greetings, Uncle Hu," Li Shiming said in the reception hall, bowing respectfully as a junior would to an elder.  

The reason for the familial address was simple—Vice Minister Hu was one of the close friends Li Wenyuan had instructed him to seek out in the capital.  

"Brother Li has raised an exceptional son. To achieve the rank of Provincial Graduate at such a young age and now preparing for the Imperial Examinations—truly remarkable," Vice Minister Hu said warmly, helping Li Shiming rise.  

"Just fortunate, nothing more," Li Shiming replied modestly.  

"Since we’re family, I’ll speak plainly. Pei Xinlu is a notorious figure in Zhongdu. The person who hired him wields considerable influence—one that’s difficult to challenge. I advise you not to act rashly. After this incident, no one will dare target you again," Vice Minister Hu said in a hushed tone.  

Though Li Shiming already knew who was behind the attack, he kept it to himself. He had his own plans.  

If he were truly defenseless, he would indeed need the authorities’ protection. But as a nascent cultivator, dealing with ordinary mortals—no matter how powerful—was hardly a challenge. Even the mightiest opponent couldn’t withstand a single talisman strike.  

Still, he understood the implication in Vice Minister Hu’s words: while Pei Xinlu could be punished, digging deeper would be difficult.  

"My father told me that if I ever faced trouble in Zhongdu, I should seek your help. I’ll follow your guidance," Li Shiming said with a smile.  

"Good. Since you trust me, I’ll do everything in my power to assist you," Vice Minister Hu replied, visibly relieved.  

His visit had been unavoidable. When news of the assassination attempt reached the Court of Judicial Review, officials at every level—including the Chief Minister—had been alarmed.  

Though Li Shiming was only a Provincial Graduate, he was a fifteen-year-old one—a prodigy whose name had already reached the Emperor’s ears. Given the quality of his examination essays, unless he made a grave mistake in the upcoming Imperial Examinations, he was almost certain to earn the rank of Metropolitan Graduate.  

Moreover, many officials in Zhongdu knew that if Li Shiming passed, his ranking would be exceptionally high. The Emperor favored auspicious signs, and a genuine prodigy like Li Shiming was something no examiner could ignore.  

Beyond that, Li Wenyuan’s connections in the capital had also influenced the Court of Judicial Review’s stance.  

Vice Minister Hu’s primary objective was to ensure Li Shiming remained unharmed before the examinations—this potential "auspicious sign" could not be allowed to come to harm.  

What Vice Minister Hu didn’t mention was that the Court of Judicial Review already had a strong suspicion about the mastermind. Regardless of evidence, they would issue a stern warning: any harm coming to Li Shiming before the examinations would mean trouble for the entire judicial system.

After seeing Vice Minister Hu off, Li Shiming summoned Steward Zhang.  

"Young Master," Steward Zhang greeted with a bow.  

"Do you know Li Wenfeng? Tell me about him," Li Shiming asked.  

Since he had no other connections in the capital, investigating this matter would have to start with his own household.  

Steward Zhang hesitated upon hearing the name.  

"Can you not speak of him?" Li Shiming pressed, his tone firm.  

"Young Master… Li Wenfeng is your second uncle. However, the Master severed ties with that side of the family years ago," Steward Zhang finally admitted.  

This revelation stunned Li Shiming. He had considered many possibilities but never imagined that Li Wenfeng was his uncle.  

An uncle hiring an assassin to kill his own nephew—this was the stuff of dramatic family feuds.  

Yet Li Shiming felt no personal turmoil. As a cultivator, he was destined to transcend mortal concerns. Moreover, the emotions he had inherited from his original self were tied solely to his father, Li Wenyuan—there was no attachment to this so-called uncle.
