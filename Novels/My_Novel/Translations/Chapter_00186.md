Chapter 186: Shocking the Heroes, Comprehending the Trait!

The idle bystanders, the guests of the Dragon Gate Tower, and the talents from the lake... all who looked over were filled with shock and astonishment.

In the rumors of the marketplace, he was described as a demon or a monster.

The wicked lieutenant of Qingning, Li Xian, was said to have a monstrous face, covered in pockmarks and ugliness, with a mouth as wide as a tiger's that could swallow a child whole. His body was said to exude a foul stench, covered in black hair.

So much so that the gossips in the prefectural city, relying purely on imagination, had created a portrait of him, spreading it with absolute certainty. Everyone knew that marketplace rumors were bound to be exaggerated, but they were certain that this wicked lieutenant was hideous beyond compare.

Now that they saw him in person, everyone suspected that some young master had come to the wrong place. Yet, upon seeing this young master, they realized he was extraordinarily handsome and elegant, with a grace and bearing rarely seen among mortals.

After a moment of silence, exclamations of shock rose and fell.

Lin Aoshan clapped her hands and cheered, "Good, excellent! What audacity, to still dare attend the banquet!" She was overjoyed.

"Grandmother, do you have a friendship with him?" an elder of the clan beside her asked.

Lin Aoshan replied, her eyes fixed on him, "He is my friend."

In the Dragon Gate Tower, Gu Nianjun was startled. His gaze fixed, scrutinizing that face. He pondered: *So he truly has a peculiar appearance. That red mole between his eyebrows... could it be... the Compassionate Physiognomy? It's said that those with the Compassionate Physiognomy often appear in the Western Regions, devoutly seeking the Buddha, their hearts filled with compassion, which causes a white hair to grow between their eyebrows. But this young man is ruthless in his actions, not like someone who believes in Buddhist principles. Moreover, his red mole is tinged with a golden aura. Regardless... it truly is an exceptionally rare visage!*

The first time they met, Li Xian had met with Xiao Fan. Fearing that the change in his appearance was too drastic and might create a rift between brothers, and also to remain low-key, he had used cosmetics to cover the mole between his eyebrows and deliberately masked his features. Though his handsomeness was still undeniable, his heroic aura and ethereal charm were inevitably diminished.

Now, his true form was revealed. His spine was like a divine mountain, his presence reserved yet surging, the red mole on his forehead visible, his face like jade, and his charm captivating. The sensory impression was completely different. Gu Nianjun observed for a long time, a slight frown forming.

"He is different from the man I saw a few days ago."

There were also whispers from other idle onlookers, continuing without end.

The forty-fifth on the Talent List, the young master of the Seven Mountain Sect, Peng Lianyun, stepped forward and asked, "Who are you? This is a banquet for the upper floors. Have you come to the wrong place?"

Li Xian replied in a clear voice, "I am Li Xian from Qingning. I received an invitation and have not come to the wrong place."

The crowd was in an uproar. Their suspicions were confirmed; it really was that Li Xian. Originally, there had been a chorus of curses, and everyone was disgusted. Now, it was completely different. Those who had previously spread idle gossip and offered wanton mockery could not help but become flustered and embarrassed.

Cao Xiuxiu, Ji Hongyan, Chu Mei, and other geniuses from the tower all looked over. Their expressions seemed disdainful, but they secretly assessed him several times, their beautiful eyes moved. They all thought to themselves: *What a heroic and handsome figure!*

Zhou Shijie's eyes flashed with a sharp light, his vision greatly enhanced, as he glanced towards the Dragon Gate Tower. He saw that on the fourth-floor private room, the gauze curtain had been drawn back, and Gu Nianjun was also looking at this person. His gaze shifted, and on the sixth-floor private room, another curtain was drawn back. That lady in white was also looking at this person, a smile playing on her lips.

The lady sensed his gaze and glanced sideways. Zhou Shijie immediately opened his folding fan to shield his eyes. But he already felt a sharp pain in his eyes, which were now covered in bloodshot veins.

"I only glanced at her for a moment, and she already noticed. What a terrifying woman!"

"What a小子 (young fellow). He relies on his handsome looks, knows the rumors are false, and deliberately makes a grand entrance last, stirring up discussion among the旁人 (others). With so much attention naturally falling on him. This小子 has a deep and calculating mind, seeking to make a spectacle of himself. How can I let you have your way? Just watch me teach you a lesson."

Zhou Shijie secretly activated his Wave-Treading Technique. His foot gently tapped the ground. The Heaven and Man Tower stood in the center of the lake, on a small island. His cultivation was profound, and his internal energy penetrated the lake.

Undercurrents surged, intending to secretly overturn the boat.

Peng Lianyun resented Li Xian for taking his spot. He had a very small tolerance for such things and already harbored hatred before even meeting. Now, seeing Li Xian hogging the spotlight and shining so brightly, his indignation grew even stronger.

He immediately employed a trick, quietly moving to the shore. Through the air, he slapped the surface of the lake. Zhou Shijie and Peng Lian出手ed simultaneously.

Both were acting in secret, unaware of each other. By an incredible coincidence, their internal energies collided. The energies became chaotic and canceled each other out, turning into a large wave that exploded upwards. It rose several zhang high, turning into a spray of water that scattered, filling the air with mist.

Peng Lianyun was greatly angered. He looked around, not knowing who had made this secret move, blocking his "Linked Mountain Palm." But then he thought, even though he hadn't managed to overturn the boat, splashing water to drench him and turn him into a drowned chicken would be excellent too.

The boat docked at the shore.

Li Xian strode onto the island, yet his clothes were not wet in the slightest. It turned out he had opened his paper umbrella and, without using any martial arts, had easily化解ed the spray.

"Hey, why did you bring an umbrella?" Cao Xiuxiu asked curiously.

Li Xian shook off the lake water, folded his umbrella, and smiled. "It might rain today, so I prepared it in advance."

"Putting on airs. As a mighty warrior, are you afraid of a little rain?" Luo Bu'er had been the first to arrive, but his spotlight had been stolen. He was already feeling憋怒 (suppressed anger) and finding it hard to vent. Now, seeing Li Xian step off the light boat and onto the island with composure, using a method identical to his own but with a completely different effect, he felt an unbearable imbalance in his heart. Thus, he mocked, "You're something else. A mere forty-fourth place, and you have the nerve to make us wait for you."

Li Xian said frankly, "My apologies for being a moment late." He was modest and polite.

The other geniuses, seeing Li Xian's courtesy, composure, and ability to remain unmoved by praise or insult, found him completely different from the rumors. While curious, they also developed a slight好感 (favorable impression).

Li Xian closed his umbrella, his eyes glinting slightly.

Long before setting out, Li Xian, unable to wait for the lady, knew he would likely have to attend the banquet alone. He had considered his trump cards for dealing with enemies and his plans for escape.

He thought: *Though my martial arts are not bad, my archery is also one of my trump cards. But bringing a bow and arrow would be too conspicuous. If the lady were to abandon me to my fate, I would still need the strength and a plan to escape on my own. For this banquet... I will only bring my saber.*

*To forge the sword and bow into the umbrella handle. To use the arrows as the umbrella ribs. If I need to use them, I can draw the handle as a sword for a surprise attack, or take the umbrella as a bow for a desperate fight.*

Having comprehended the [Excellent Hands] trait, he removed the Golden Leopard Sinew. He carved mechanisms into the bow body, added oil paper, and deliberately painted it with yellow lacquer to avoid being conspicuous.

It was a perfect disguise.

Zhou Shijie said, "Since everyone has arrived, let the banquet begin!" He turned and went upstairs, directly ascending to the seventh floor to take the seat of honor.

Li Xian watched his back and followed the crowd into the Heaven and Man Tower. The tower was entirely black and was a circular structure.

It had no walls or windows on its four sides. It was supported entirely by stone pillars, so those sitting within could have a full view of the lake scenery.

The first snow of the season had fallen, and the lake's waves rippled, yet it showed no sign of freezing.

Mist further filled the air.

Although the shore was crowded with people, the ingenious design meant that the noise from the shore could not reach the Heaven and Man Tower. Conversely, the conversations of the geniuses within the tower could be heard on the shore.

The lake was vast and wide, its waters misty and boundless.

It was about ten li across. From within the Heaven and Man Tower, the figures on the shore were like tiny black dots. The environment and scenery here were crafted to be wonderfully unique.

The weather was cold.

A cold wind blew into the tower, but the young geniuses gathered together, eating and drinking. What a rare and beautiful scene it was.

The spirit of youth was entirely contained within this tower. The prefectural city was a place of hidden talent and concealed dragons. Among them were older geniuses with greater strength. But only those in their prime, who knew not the height of the heavens or the thickness of the earth, possessed such spirit.

On the seventh floor, one person sat; on the sixth, four; on the fifth, six; on the fourth, ten; on the third, fourteen; on the second, nineteen; and on the first, twenty-one.

A total of seventy-five seats.

Li Xian, ranked "forty-fourth," took his seat on the second floor.

He saw that the tables were arranged in a circle. There were no dishes on the tables, but incense was already burning, and tea sets, wine cups, and warming stoves were laid out... The banquet tables were exquisitely prepared.

In the very center stood a bronze tripod. It was filled with wine, and the aroma was overflowing. Hua Fei, the genius ranked fifty-second, smelled the wine from the tripod and said joyfully, "Fine wine, excellent wine! This is the prefectural city's famous brew, 'Dream of a Thousand Returns.' One sip of this wine is like a thousand beautiful dreams, worth a thousand gold pieces!"

He looked it over for a moment and shook his head in regret. "Such fine wine, it's a shame there's not much of it. In such a large bronze tripod, how can it only hold this much? Heh, not enough to even get between my teeth."

Suddenly, a voice drifted over from the lakeshore: "If Young Master Hua Fei is not satisfied, you may come upstairs to ask for more."

Hua Fei was stunned. He looked towards the shore. Only then did he realize his words had been heard, and the people on the shore were laughing at him. The various clans who had hosted the "Layered Tower Banquet" for decades or even centuries heard this and immediately used their energy to amplify their voices, responding to him.

Hua Fei cupped his fists and said, "Very well, if I have the chance, I will certainly come upstairs to ask for some fine wine."

Everyone had taken their seats. Li Xian looked around and greeted the geniuses beside him. The two returned the smile and raised their tea cups in a shared drink, maintaining proper etiquette.

At this time, the snow began to fall more heavily. Looking into the distance, the world was a beautiful scene of white snow. Although there were many onlookers, because the lake was so vast, one could look up to the blue sky and down to the green waves. There was no sense of confinement at all.

The temperature was freezing, but the geniuses in the tower had a unique and special atmosphere.

Soon, dishes were served one after another. Those who delivered the food were all graceful young women. They came from all directions on small boats, delivering exquisite delicacies.

Traveling back and forth on the lake, they could not be very fast.

The first dish on the second floor was named "First Snow on a Red Branch." It perfectly complemented the scene. The dish had a unique shape: on a slender white branch, a small "red fruit" was congealed.

This "red fruit" was made from "autumn-water black goose liver," prepared through a secret method. Then, the "ten-year-old medicinal snake gall from the southern mountain" was taken to remove its toxicity and foul smell.

The goose liver was used to wrap the snake gall. At the same time, it was drenched with a layer of juice made from hundreds of different herbs, boiled for five days and ten nights. The juice solidified and turned red.

It was then hung on the slender white branch.

Thus, it was named "First Snow on a Red Branch," symbolizing great wealth and honor, and winning the first prize.

Li Xian sighed: "This small red fruit is several times more difficult to make than refining an elixir. The amount of effort and money involved is immeasurable. The prefectural city is truly extravagant!"

"Gentlemen all."

Pang Hao, ranked thirty-seventh, cupped his fists and smiled. "Friends from the prefectural city need not listen, but friends from out of town may not know. For such a fine dish, the method of eating it is also highly particular."

"If you eat it incorrectly, the snake gall inside will break, and it will be foul and bitter. This snake gall is no ordinary thing; it contains potent medicinal energy. Don't say I didn't warn you. If it breaks in your mouth, the bitterness will not fade for a month."

"This red fruit... should be eaten like this."

He picked up the slender branch, the red fruit swaying. He poured wine over it, then reached two fingers into the warming stove, drew out a缕 of flame, and set the red fruit alight.

With the flame still burning, he swallowed it whole.

He revealed an expression of satisfaction.

The lingering heat and alcohol in his mouth. He blew towards the众人 (crowd), and a fire dragon coiled in the air, its momentum quite impressive. The列 (ranks) were all geniuses, each with their own strengths and unique skills, and naturally, they were always thinking of how to show off.

This one move was enough to show this person's "lung" skill was exceptional. The fire dragon lingered in the air for a long time, vivid and lifelike. His internal energy reserve was also likely not shallow. At the very least, he had undergone his first transformation, possessing a fifteen-zhang lake body.

The other geniuses, unwilling to be outdone, followed suit. A single dish could be eaten in a thousand different ways.

Li Xian followed the same method, tasting the "Red Branch." It entered his mouth with a scorching heat, his body feeling like a furnace. The burning red fruit continued to burn after entering his stomach. But the flames were gentle and did not harm his body.

Instead, it was like a furnace, warming his entire body. The cold was completely dispelled. Even in the freezing cold, he could comfortably appreciate the scenery and chat leisurely with the other geniuses.
