# Chapter 29: Spiritual Energy Armament  

"This is the area where the alchemy hall elders refine pills. It's best not to come here unless necessary—the elders dislike being disturbed."  

"This is where the alchemy disciples practice their craft. You shouldn’t get too close either, as some are still beginners and often cause explosions."  

"And this room? Oh, this one’s special! It’s reserved for your lovely Fourth Senior Sister—my future alchemy chamber. Once I’m skilled enough to stand on my own, I’ll be refining pills here."  

On their way to register, Jiang Li didn’t take a direct route. His kind yet somewhat eccentric senior sister led him on a tour of the alchemy hall, explaining its layout and taboos.  

"Senior Sister, are there many alchemy chambers like Master’s in the alchemy hall?"  

Jiang Li noticed that the white buildings in the experimental alchemy chamber area were few in number—only a handful at most.  

"Not many. Developing a new pill formula requires an enormous investment. Even with the sect’s support, it’s an immense challenge and burden for the alchemist."  

"In our Hidden Scripture Valley, very few alchemists are capable of creating new formulas. Master Red-Hair is one of them, but even they don’t work on new formulas all the time."  

"Only when inspiration strikes do they apply for the sect’s resources to support their research."  

"And not every attempt succeeds. Master Red-Hair has failed many times—even before I became his disciple, he had numerous failures."  

Jiang Li’s eyes flickered with a strange light.  

"What happens to those failed formulas? Are they destroyed?"  

He asked tentatively.  

"Of course not! Even if they didn’t succeed, those formulas still required a tremendous investment. Even if the side effects couldn’t be eliminated or the pill couldn’t be perfected, they serve as valuable references for future alchemists."  

"All abandoned failed formulas are stored in the experimental alchemy chambers. If you want to study them, you can take a look."  

Fourth Senior Sister’s answer made Jiang Li’s eyes gleam, though he didn’t show it outwardly. After some more casual conversation, they finally arrived at the alchemy hall’s administrative office to complete his registration.  

As a nominal disciple, Jiang Li wasn’t formally apprenticed—he remained an outer sect disciple. In truth, the alchemy hall had many nominal disciples from both the outer and inner sects.  

This status indicated that a particular skill of theirs had caught a elder’s attention, leading to their mentorship for guidance and tasks.  

Of course, most nominal disciples in the alchemy hall were recognized for their alchemical talent. Jiang Li, however, was taken in for his ability to "test pills."  

But the reason didn’t matter. After registration, like other disciples, Jiang Li could now freely enter and exit the alchemy hall and receive formal instruction in alchemy.  

---  

Unlike the superficial, barely-there teaching style of the Scripture Pavilion elders, here Jiang Li could truly delve into profound knowledge.  

When they returned to the experimental alchemy chamber, Master Red-Hair was no longer there. Presumably, he had taken the pills and formulas to report to the sect’s higher-ups and claim his rewards.  

However, a few items remained on the long table from earlier.  

Aside from Jiang Li’s payment for the day, there was also an alchemist’s robe, an alchemy manual, and a small pill furnace.  

"Junior Brother Jiang Li, Master left these for you."  

"This little pill furnace was actually used by Master when he was young."  

Oh? Was there something special about this furnace? Jiang Li wondered.  

"Then it was used by previous senior brothers, and later by me. Now, Master has passed it on to you."  

Jiang Li: (≖͞_≖̥) ... I thought too much.  

"Senior Sister, can we take a look at the failed formulas?"  

Jiang Li suddenly asked.  

"Failed formulas? What for? You’re not thinking of refining them into successful ones, are you? No, no—even Master and the elders couldn’t do it."  

Fourth Senior Sister waved her hands dismissively, trying to dissuade Jiang Li from such unrealistic ambitions.  

"No, no. It’s just... as you know, even a single complete pill formula is very expensive."  

"I’m just starting to learn alchemy. I don’t expect to succeed, but I can use the failed formulas to gain some experience. Right?"  

Jiang Li fabricated a reasonable excuse, and Fourth Senior Sister, after some thought, found no major flaw in it and didn’t object further.  

"If that’s the case, then fine. Follow me."  

She led him to a large room at the back.  

As soon as the door opened, the pungent smell of decaying paper assaulted their senses.  

These were all discarded formulas still in the experimental stage—rarely valuable enough to be preserved in jade slips.  

"Most of these are Yellow-rank pill formulas. These two shelves contain ones with lower difficulty. You can pick one from here."  

Jiang Li’s lips went dry as he gazed at the rows of shelves, as if seeing piles of glowing spirit stones.  

After a long while of browsing, Jiang Li finally selected a formula that caught his interest. He took out paper and ink and began copying it meticulously.  

A considerable amount of time later, Jiang Li double-checked the text to ensure no errors or omissions before carefully storing the copied formula and leaving.  

Carrying the small pill furnace back to the outer sect, Jiang Li attracted envious glances from many.  

A pill furnace—even a small, old one—would likely cost over a hundred spirit stones.  

For most outer sect disciples, this was an unattainable luxury.  

Moreover, owning a pill furnace implied that he was practicing alchemy—a highly sought-after secondary profession in the cultivation world. Achieving mastery in it could even elevate a lowly cultivator’s status.  

Especially for those with inferior spiritual roots, whose cultivation prospects were dim, these secondary professions might be their only path forward.  

Returning to his room, Jiang Li placed the furnace on the table, secured the doors and windows, and ensured no one was eavesdropping before pulling out a porcelain vial from his robes.  

This was one of the abandoned formulas for the Hardened Skin Pill—the one Jiang Li had secretly swapped with a failed pill and smuggled out.  

When Jiang Li had consumed this pill earlier, his skin showed no visible changes, so he had reported it as a failure to Master Red-Hair.  

But in reality, his status panel had displayed this message:  

**[Consumed Experimental Hardened Skin Pill: Energy Absorption Hardening activated on self.]**  

**[Energy Absorption Hardening: Skin hardens upon absorbing spiritual energy. Hardening strength depends on absorbed energy. Duration: 2 hours.]**  

The previous pill’s effects had long since worn off. Now, Jiang Li swallowed the pill and waited quietly.  

Soon, he channeled a stream of spiritual energy toward his palm.  

The energy was swiftly absorbed by the skin on his hand. Jiang Li felt his palm grow firm and dense, as if encased in armor.  

Indeed, this was fascinating.  

**[Overconsumption of Experimental Hardened Skin Pill: Spiritual Energy Armament activated on self. Petrification of skin will occur after effect ends.]**  

**[Spiritual Energy Armament: Skin hardens upon absorbing spiritual energy. Energy absorption speed increased. Hardening strength depends on absorbed energy. Hardening coefficient ×2. Duration: 2 hours.]**
