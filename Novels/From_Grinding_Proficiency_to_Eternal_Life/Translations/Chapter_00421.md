# Chapter 421: The Mysteries of Foundation Establishment

His gaze was like lightning as he looked at the three Golden Core Phases towering beyond the Floating Mountain.

True Lord Qingyuan, True Lord Chunyang, and Bodhisattva Miaodi...

These three great powers likely never imagined that the blessed land of Floating Mountain they fought over would ultimately benefit a mere Qi Condensation cultivator.

A cold smile curled at the corners of Xu Yunfan's lips.

"It's time to go."

Xu Yunfan walked through the gore toward the main hall, his eyes falling on the Mountain Seal within. Without hesitation, he scooped it up, turned, and departed. He streaked through the air, leaving a trail of light as he charged toward True Lord Qingyuan.

The moment Xu Yunfan breached the boundaries of Floating Mountain, his aura began to rise infinitely. The entire sky suddenly collapsed into a vortex.

The three vast auras simultaneously stagnated.

True Lord Chunyang's nine golden suns abruptly contracted, and a dragon-like tremor echoed between heaven and earth. The supreme expert of the Wansheng Sword Sect watched the Black Tortoise and Snake intertwined True Warrior Phase rising around Xu Yunfan, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.

"Interesting..."

Bodhisattva Miaodi lowered her gaze, looking at Xu Yunfan who was forging his Dao Foundation. The Eight-Treasured Glazed Pagoda in her hand turned slightly, and the eighty-four thousand demons imprisoned within wailed in unison. Then, a pure Buddhist chant suddenly rippled out, subtly directed toward Xu Yunfan.

At that moment, the clear qi of True Lord Qingyuan's Immortal Palace suddenly condensed into a thousand-zhang brilliance, interposing itself between the Buddhist light and Xu Yunfan. The countless Daoist shadows manifested within the clear qi simultaneously formed hand seals, forcibly cutting off the trajectory of the Glazed Pagoda by three inches.

"Friend Miaodi," a half-mocking voice came from the depths of the Immortal Palace. "My Primal Origin Sect rarely has a disciple who enters the Dao through martial prowess and achieves Foundation Establishment. Are you so eager to plant a Buddhist seed right in front of me? Do you think I don't exist?"

The wailing of the demons within the Glazed Pagoda abruptly ceased.

Bodhisattva Miaodi shifted her golden body slightly. The myriad "swastika" characters appearing in her sevenfold Buddhist light suddenly reversed, as the *Reverse Evolution: Sutra of Burning* was activated. However, True Lord Chunyang's sword case beside her suddenly opened a fraction, and a wisp of sword qi obliterated the reversing Buddhist curse into nothingness.

Miaodi abruptly stopped her action.

She could handle True Lord Qingyuan alone, but with the Sword Immortal Chunyang of the Wansheng Sword Sect nearby, if she made a move, she might be taken advantage of. This True Lord Chunyang was known for despising the Buddhist sect's methods of salvation.

"Qingyuan!" The Buddha轮 (wheel) behind Bodhisattva Miaodi's head vibrated, yet her voice remained gentle. "This child bears the Black Tortoise destiny, and is deeply fated with my Buddhist sect..."

"Your words are nothing but farting!" True Lord Qingyuan sneered. "Why don't you say that this Great World of Taihua Lingxu is fated with you, and let us all move away?"

*I wish I could!*

Bodhisattva Miaodi couldn't help but sigh in her heart. This great world had so many positions of authority; if it were only the Bodhi Pure Land, wouldn't there be a few more Buddhas and dozens more Bodhisattvas?

Bodhisattva Miaodi sighed softly, and the Glazed Pagoda finally returned to its original position.

Seeing this, True Lord Qingyuan sneered. The wind chimes on the eaves of the Immortal Palace tinkled, carrying a voice of undisguised mockery: "Thick-skinned!"

Bodhisattva Miaodi's expression remained unchanged. She merely recited a Buddhist name softly and said no more.

At this moment, wrapped in the True Warrior Phase, Xu Yunfan's perception was forcibly elevated to an incredible height. The cultivators fighting below turned into firefly glimmers, the Floating Mountain shrank to a black piece on a chessboard, and even the originally indistinct Phases of the three Golden Core True Lords now revealed some clues.

This was not looking down from above, but a form of "observation" that transcended the three dimensions. He simultaneously saw the 129,600 talisman seeds lurking within True Lord Qingyuan's Immortal Palace clear qi, saw through the karmic entanglement of nine lifetimes within Bodhisattva Miaodi's golden body, and even captured that wisp of terrifying sword intent within True Lord Chunyang's sword case that could almost split the world.

These were the power levels that the three Golden Core True Lords had displayed without any concealment.

The world stripped away its superficial appearance before his eyes, becoming a giant net woven from threads of rules.

"So this is what the world can be like..."

Xu Yunfan's heart was filled with insight, and the Martial Dao Sky Eye between his eyebrows trembled incessantly. The Black Tortoise Suppressing Demon Seal in his Dantian suddenly disintegrated, transforming into a bronze furnace. The sword intent, Buddhist power, and demonic qi he had previously devoured churned within the furnace, ground into chaos by the millstone formed by the intertwining of the龟 (turtle) and蛇 (snake).

As the spiritual energy of heaven and earth turned into fuel, constantly adding fire, all impurities were refined into crystal-clear, deep black liquid drops.

*Magical Power!*

Xu Yunfan realized in his heart.

This was the transformation of True Essence, a medium of power more attuned to heaven and earth. Once used, it could truly leverage the power of the heavens and earth, displaying infinite might. This was the true "True Warrior Magical Power."

Each drop was as heavy as a mountain yet as light as dust, containing the innate Dao charm of subduing demons and suppressing evil. The True Essence of the Qi Condensation stage was merely roughly processed spiritual energy, while the Magical Power of Foundation Establishment was a creation that resonated with the Heavenly Dao.

When the 360 drops of Magical Power condensed from the vast True Essence in his body converged into a stream, he heard the crisp sound of shackles breaking in the void.

The moment the True Essence transformed into Magical Power aura and nourished his physical body, Xu Yunfan's surface oozed foul black blood. His bones emitted the clear sound of jade colliding, his bone marrow turned from gold to purple, Black Tortoise scale patterns appeared under his skin before vanishing, and his pores closed up on their own like a newborn infant.

The most astonishing change occurred in his spine: the thirty-three vertebrae lit up one by one, as if connecting to some celestial pivot. This was the "Heavenly Pillar Penetrating the Nether" phenomenon recorded in the *True Warrior Subduing Demon Sutra*. Forging the Dao Foundation meant the physical body had left the category of the mortal shell and began to autonomously breathe the元气 (vital energy) of heaven and earth.

When the Magical Power pierced through the眉心 (glabella), Xu Yunfan "saw" his own brain domain. The originally chaotic Sea of Consciousness was separated by clear and turbid qi, and above it floated a transparent small figure condensed by Martial Dao will—this was the embryonic form of Divine Sense.

The "Lin" character mantra had long since refined his own spirit, and it finally manifested completely at this moment.

In an instant, the emotions of all living creatures within a radius of ten miles surged in like a tide. The indifference of the three Golden Core True Lords toward everything, the fear of the remaining cultivators, and even the restlessness of insects and ants in the earth veins were all clearly visible.

This perception was not through the five senses, but by directly reading the information stream imprinted on heaven and earth—this was the "Divine Sense Reflection" unique to Foundation Establishment cultivators.

*So that's how it is.* This is the foundation for Foundation Establishment True Persons to manipulate the karma of others and perform "Heavenly Dao Calculation." Divine Sense Reflection turns heaven and earth into a bright mirror, where the trajectories of all things leave their imprints.

Although Foundation Establishment cultivators cannot truly篡改 (tamper with) the fixed numbers of the Heavenly Dao, they can窥见 (glimpse) three inches of opportunity like a spectator, lightly rippling the river of fate, or截取 (intercept) a wisp of dissipating fortune, or avoid an emerging calamity, or even use the karma of others to counter their own spells.

Just like the 129,600 talisman seeds lurking within True Lord Qingyuan's Immortal Palace clear qi, each one is an "interpretation" and "borrowing" of the rules of heaven and earth.

When his Dantian roared and trembled, Xu Yunfan's True Warrior Magical Power suddenly collapsed into a vortex. The Black Tortoise Suppressing Demon Seal, coiled by the turtle and snake, completely disintegrated. In the Dantian Sea of Qi, the Three Treasures of Essence, Qi, and Spirit gathered together, reforging into a three-headed, six-armed Black Tortoise Dao Form.
