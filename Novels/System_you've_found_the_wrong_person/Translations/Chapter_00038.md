# Chapter 38: Ranked First on the Earthly List, the Three Suns Divine Lord

"Wake up! Wake up now!"

Dou Changsheng watched as Qingyang Daoist spat blood and collapsed to the ground, his eyes burning with urgency.

Coming to Three Suns Mountain and getting entangled in the military payroll case had already seemed like terrible luck. But who would have thought the real misfortune lay here?

Not only had he uncovered the truth behind the missing military funds, but he'd also obtained a portion of Regenerating Mystic Water. Yet when did good fortune ever fall from the sky? Learning the young emperor's secret was enough to invite fatal consequences.

Northern Jin stood as the foremost of the four kingdoms, the strongest nation under heaven. And the young emperor was still an emperor. While he couldn't order the deaths of Chen Qingyao or Yu Yun with a single word, he certainly could have Dou Changsheng killed.

Moreover, the value of this Regenerating Mystic Water was no small matter. Both the Prime Minister's residence and the Shogunate were vying for it, demonstrating the worth of Qingyang's secret technique. Yet now Qingyang Daoist was dead—having met with Dou Changsheng and gifted him the mystic water before dying.

If Dou Changsheng claimed he didn't know Qingyang's secret technique or how to produce Regenerating Mystic Water, who in the world would believe him? But damn it all—he truly didn't know!

This Qingyang Daoist was truly a despicable bastard.

Dou Changsheng shook the lifeless body urgently. "Let's talk this through properly. You're a Divine Marvel Grandmaster—how can you give up so easily? Even if you can't kill other grandmasters, can't you at least target their disciples? Take the Lin Clan of the capital—their Patriarch Blade is an Earthly List grandmaster, but Lin Daoqi's direct descendants are only at the Innate Realm. Poison them, ambush them—kill a few, and Patriarch Blade would be devastated."

He nearly mentioned the Prime Minister's residence but stopped himself. Qingyang Daoist's pulse had completely vanished, his heart no longer beating. The result left Dou Changsheng deeply disappointed.

This matter was now impossible to explain. From now on, he would be seen as Qingyang's successor—the only person in the world who knew how to produce Regenerating Mystic Water. Even if some suspected Qingyang Daoist had ulterior motives, the sheer value of the mystic water would make them gamble on the chance that Dou Changsheng might actually know the technique.

After all, he was merely an Innate Realm martial artist.

*Clang!*

Dou Changsheng drew his Hero's Sword and pressed it against Qingyang Daoist's corpse. He sensed nothing unusual—no signs of life. The possibility that Qingyang was feigning death crossed his mind, that this might all be a test.

The urge to stab the corpse through the heart and temples surged within him, but he hesitated and suppressed it. Qingyang Daoist was the sect master of Three Suns Sect, a Divine Marvel Grandmaster. His death during the military payroll investigation would attract intense scrutiny.

If Dou Changsheng acted recklessly, he would undoubtedly be discovered. This was precisely why Qingyang Daoist had been so confident, dying without any precautions. Soon, the news of their meeting and Qingyang's subsequent death would spread far and wide.

Sheathing his sword, Dou Changsheng felt utterly defeated. He stood motionless, all resistance drained from him. 

He had accepted it. 

He would simply give up. 

If he refused to play the game, no one could force him. 

So what if it was Regenerating Mystic Water? He didn’t want it anyway—let them come and take it.

At the same time, a paper crane fluttered into the night sky, vanishing in an instant.

Even if he intended to surrender, lacking any backing meant he would be abandoned and manipulated by all sides. So, he needed to seek connections. 

Fortunately, he still had a means of contacting Night Princess, Tang Qingyan. He decided to follow her guidance. As a Pure Yin Grandmaster with vast experience, she might have a way to resolve everything—perhaps things wouldn’t spiral as Qingyang Daoist had predicted.

A sudden gust of wind lifted the hair from Dou Changsheng’s forehead. 

An ethereal voice spoke: "You’ve been too careless. At such a critical time, how could you venture out alone at night?"

Tang Qingyan stood mid-air, her figure swaying like a spirit of the night, her features obscured. 

"Many are watching your movements. Countless eyes saw you meeting Qingyang Daoist in secret. Now that he’s died under mysterious circumstances, you’ll never be able to explain it away."

With a single glance, she grasped the entire situation.

Dou Changsheng cut straight to the point: "Sister Qingyan, what should I do?"

Tang Qingyan pondered briefly. "Not leaving immediately works in your favor. There’s still room for explanation—though they won’t believe you. The simplest solution is to fight poison with poison—make them afraid to touch you."

"Regenerating Mystic Water is valuable, but it’s ultimately just a secret technique. Similar things exist across the world. The only reason they targeted Three Suns Sect was because Qingyang Daoist was weak. Had he been as formidable as his ancestor, who would have dared covet it?"

"Ranked first on the Earthly List—the Three Suns Divine Lord—was a peerless figure three hundred years ago. Three Suns Mountain was a renowned peak, a hub of trade and culture, where sages lectured and generations of luminaries left their marks. Countless sects flourished here, none of them weak."

"Yet the Three Suns Divine Lord razed them all, purging the mountain over a century until even the capital bowed before him. No one in the world dared entertain even a whisper of defiance against Three Suns Mountain."

"Back then, what majesty he commanded! Regenerating Mystic Water—reviving the dead, regrowing flesh from bones!"

*Damn it! Stop talking!*

The situation was spiraling out of control. 

Now Dou Changsheng understood why the Shogunate, the Prime Minister’s residence, and even the imperial palace coveted a mere Three Suns Sect. They weren’t just after the mystic water—they wanted the legacy of the Three Suns Divine Lord himself.

The Martial World Rankings—Heavenly, Earthly, and Human Lists—might have questionable entries at the bottom, but the top positions were undisputed. If they weren’t strong, they wouldn’t have survived.

And first on the Earthly List? That was a terror capable of making an entire nation tremble with vigilance.

Tang Qingyan continued, "After the Three Suns Divine Lord vanished a hundred and fifty years ago, the sect declined steadily. Yet even now, no one has dared destroy Three Suns Sect and seize this sacred mountain where sages once lectured."

"Because they all fear that the Three Suns Divine Lord has already transcended the first Heavenly Tribulation and is undergoing his celestial metamorphosis. If he returns to find his legacy destroyed, none could withstand his wrath."

"Three Origins Unified, Defying Heaven Itself—that 'heaven' refers to the Celestial Realm. Transcending the thunder tribulation, ascending to the Celestial Rank—his name etched upon the Heavenly List."

"First on the Earthly List—his chances of success are immense."

"This is both misfortune and fortune. If the Three Suns Divine Lord still lives, you are now his sole successor."

"Between us, tell me the truth—did you really not receive it?"
