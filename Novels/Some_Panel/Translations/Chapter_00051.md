# Chapter 51: Becoming a Disciple of Sword Yuanzi

A Nascent Soul True Monarch’s speed was incredibly fast; flying through the sky, the world was blurred into streaking afterimages.

In half a day, the two had already arrived at Canglan Island and flew above the Canglan Sect.

“Below us is the Canglan Sect.”

Following True Monarch Ling Gu’s gaze, Yang Ji saw a majestic mountain range stretching for thousands of miles, its form resembling a dragon, winding on seemingly without end. It was truly magnificent and breathtaking.

Looking down from a thousand feet in the air, his eyes were met with countless strange peaks and deep valleys.

Focusing his vision intently, he could also see magnificent waterfalls on the mountain peaks, like silver rivers cascading down, flowing over thousand-foot cliffs with boundless momentum.

Above the mountain peaks, amidst ancient trees, spiritual birds occasionally flew by, emitting clear cries—a veritable immortal realm on earth.

Without waiting for Yang Ji to admire it further, True Monarch Ling Gu seized him and flew towards a mountain peak as sharp as a sword.

As they drew closer, Yang Ji noticed a middle-aged man standing in the void before the mountain peak.

The middle-aged man had a gentle smile on his refined face and wore a white robe, exuding a strong aura of immortal dao. He was identical to the figure in the Sword Dao Imprint; who else could it be but Sword Yuanzi?

Seeing True Monarch Ling Gu and Yang Ji approach, Sword Yuanzi smiled faintly and said, “Junior Brother!”

“Senior Brother, I’ve brought the person you asked for,” True Monarch Ling Gu said, drawing near with Yang Ji. Yang Ji quickly cupped his hands in a salute: “Greetings, Senior.”

“You must be Yang Ji, correct?” Sword Yuanzi looked at him gently, appraising him.

“This junior is indeed Yang Ji,” Yang Ji replied.

“We have never met, yet we are connected through the Sword Dao Imprint. If we can become master and disciple, it is also a form of destiny. I intend to take you as my disciple; are you willing to follow me?” Sword Yuanzi said with a light smile.

“This disciple is willing!” Sword Yuanzi’s detached, gentle, and refined demeanor greatly appealed to Yang Ji. Moreover, he was a formidable Nascent Soul True Monarch; countless people yearned to become his disciple but could not. Yang Ji was naturally delighted to join his lineage.

“Your appearance is very pure and amiable, and your pupils also hold firmness and composure. This master is very satisfied,” Sword Yuanzi said faintly.

Yang Ji humbly bowed deeply: “Master praises me too highly.”

“Congratulations, Senior Brother, on taking another excellent disciple. Nephew-disciple Yang Ji, your Martial Uncle has nothing much to give you, so this little trinket can serve as a welcoming gift.”

True Monarch Ling Gu smiled slightly, and a faint spiritual light flashed in his palm. A brocade box appeared out of thin air and was handed to Yang Ji.

“So mysterious, even put in a brocade box. Little Ji, open it and see what it is?”

Sword Yuanzi smiled and nodded, signaling Yang Ji to accept it.

True Monarch Ling Gu looked helpless, yet he smiled calmly, clearly confident in his gift.

From his expression, it was evident that the treasure inside was extraordinary.

Yang Ji glanced at True Monarch Ling Gu out of the corner of his eye and saw `[Open it quickly!]` displayed above his head.

Sword Yuanzi likely noticed the hint of smugness on True Monarch Ling Gu’s face, which was why he told Yang Ji to open it.

Yang Ji smiled inwardly. He decided to follow the wishes of the two seniors and open the brocade box, satisfying True Monarch Ling Gu’s small vanity.

Click!

As the brocade box opened, a spiritual halo immediately surged out, like the moon, scattering endless soft light.

Being in this spiritual glow, one felt utterly comfortable, ethereal and joyful, as if about to ascend to immortality in broad daylight.

“This is a top-grade Spirit Gathering Pearl, born between heaven and earth,” Sword Yuanzi recognized the item at a glance.

“A Spirit Gathering Pearl can autonomously absorb and purify spiritual energy, storing it in its internal space. It’s equivalent to a cultivator’s second Dantian, so when fighting, there’s no fear of spiritual energy depletion.”

“The spiritual energy it emits can improve one’s physique. Keeping it on one’s person year-round can extend lifespan and maintain youth, offering tremendous benefits.”

“It also has a short-term abstention from grains effect.”

“As the saying goes, ‘He who consumes qi becomes divine and immortal.’ Absorbing the special spiritual energy within it means you can go a month without needing to eat.”

Sword Yuanzi listed the Spirit Gathering Pearl’s effects one by one, then smiled and said, “This is a great treasure. Why don’t you quickly thank your Martial Uncle Ling Gu?”

“Thank you, Martial Uncle!”

Yang Ji’s heart swelled with joy, and he quickly expressed his gratitude.

The mere effect of it being equivalent to a second Dantian was enough to make one drool. No wonder True Monarch Ling Gu wanted to show it off on the spot; it truly was a great treasure.

True Monarch Ling Gu chuckled and nodded: “Then, Senior Brother, I’ll be busy, so I’ll return to the Demonic Scent Sea Region first.”

“Alright, good!” Sword Yuanzi replied.

Seeing True Monarch Ling Gu transform into a black speck and vanish into the horizon, Sword Yuanzi turned to Yang Ji and said, “Little Ji, follow me.”

Yang Ji followed Sword Yuanzi as they flew higher, quickly passing the mountainside and arriving at the summit.

Before them appeared a magnificent complex of buildings. The most prominent was a large hall named “Sword Pavilion.”

“Greetings, Young Peak Master!”

As soon as they landed, more than a dozen people, half male and half female, streamed out from within the hall.

Led by a white-haired elder, they meticulously lined up in two rows and bowed to Yang Ji.

Yang Ji’s eyes widened immediately; the aura of these dozen or so people was incredibly strong, with the lowest being at the Foundation Establishment realm.

The leading elder’s aura was even more obscure; he was actually a late Core Formation realm expert.

These people were all official disciples of the sect, with esteemed status.

Yet, they eagerly sought to enter this place, willing to be at someone else’s beck and call.

The reason for this was that a Nascent Soul True Monarch resided here.

If they could receive even a hint or two of guidance from the True Monarch, it would be a tremendous fortune, enough to benefit them for a lifetime.

However, this elder was a master of the late Core Formation realm, just one step away from a Nascent Soul True Monarch, yet he was willing to serve. This truly surprised Yang Ji.

“Let me introduce you. This is the disciple I just accepted today, named Yang Ji,” Sword Yuanzi said blandly.

“Greetings, Young Peak Master!”

The crowd immediately bowed in unison, respectfully calling out.

“You can just call me Yang Ji,” Yang Ji quickly returned the bow. This kind of scene made him even more flustered than meeting two Nascent Soul True Monarchs, and at the same time, a feeling of lightheadedness rose within him.

He somewhat understood now.

Why everyone in the world desired to be emperor; this feeling of being worshipped could indeed make one lose oneself.

“Young Master, this old servant’s name is Lun Nu, and I am the steward here. Young Master, please feel free to command me in the future.”

The gray-haired elder’s voice was deep, his eyes bright, appearing very shrewd and experienced.

“Old Nu, if anything comes up, I will certainly trouble you. I hope you won’t mind then.”

Yang Ji smiled, his expression very sincere, his eyes clear and free of impurities.

“This old servant wouldn’t dare. Young Master, please feel free to give your orders.”

Lun Nu’s expression became solemn, and he immediately bowed.

Yang Ji faced the crowd with polite and proper demeanor, showing no arrogance.

Seeing this, Sword Yuanzi secretly nodded in satisfaction.

“Little Ji, follow me.” Sword Yuanzi led Yang Ji into the Sword Pavilion.

Watching the two enter the hall, those outside began discussing among themselves.

“The Peak Master has only taken Senior Brother Li Changxiao as a disciple before, and that was because he comprehended the Severing Sword Dao from the Sword Dao Imprint. Could it be that this new Young Peak Master is also for the same reason?” A young male disciple curiously peered inside.

“The Young Peak Master is so handsome! If only I could bring him under my skirt and become cultivation partners with him.”

A female disciple, her face flushed with longing, swayed her slender waist as she gazed into the hall, revealing unconcealed desire.

“Hmm?” Lun Nu suddenly exuded a chill, enveloping the female disciple.

“Old Nu, forgive me!”

The female disciple immediately lowered her head in terror, pulling her skirt tighter.

Lun Nu looked in the direction where Yang Ji had disappeared and said, “Seeing the Young Peak Master is like seeing the Peak Master himself. You must maintain due respect. If anyone dares to act presumptuously, their limbs will be crippled, and they will be expelled from Sword Dao Peak.”

“Yes!”

Everyone’s bodies trembled slightly as they replied in unison.

Inside the Sword Pavilion, in a room, Sword Yuanzi and Yang Ji sat facing each other.

“Little Ji, your master’s true name is Lun Zhi. Outsiders respectfully call me True Monarch Sword Yuan.” Sword Yuanzi said faintly.

“Lun Zhi? Master and Steward Lun Nu?” Yang Ji asked out of curiosity.

Seeing Sword Yuanzi’s faint smile, he realized his mistake and quickly added: “This disciple spoke out of turn. I shouldn’t have asked too much.”

Sword Yuanzi chuckled, “Since I’ve told you, I naturally won’t be so particular.”

“Lun Nu is a servant of my Lun family, but I’ve always treated him as an elder.”

Yang Ji nodded lightly and said, “Thank you, Master, for your trust.”

“No matter! Since I’ve taken you as a disciple, if there isn’t even this much trust, how can we speak of the long path of eternal life ahead?” Sword Yuanzi smiled freely, quite magnanimously.
