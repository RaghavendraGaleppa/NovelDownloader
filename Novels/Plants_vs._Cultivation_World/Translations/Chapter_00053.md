# Chapter 53: Supreme-Grade Sunflower  

After confirming that Sun Essence was required to upgrade the Sunflower, Gu Mo poured all 15 portions of Sun Essence he harvested daily into the cultivation pot. As the essence was added, the upgrade arrow gradually turned green.  

Upon investing the 50th portion of Sun Essence, Gu Mo noticed the arrow had turned completely green. Without hesitation, he clicked it.  

A radiant light enveloped the Sunflower, and moments later, it dissipated, revealing a slightly taller plant.  

**Name:** Sunflower  
**Grade:** Mid-Grade Tier 1  
**Effect:** Condenses Sun Essence  
**Planting Condition:** Tier 1 Spirit Field  

"Mid-Grade Tier 1!"  

Gu Mo scanned the upgraded Sunflower's attributes, elated. Behind the grade indicator, he spotted another gray arrow.  

Did this mean the Mid-Grade Tier 1 Sunflower could be upgraded further? If he raised it to High-Grade Tier 1, would the condensed Sun Essence become even more potent?  

Honestly, Gu Mo was tempted. But first, he needed to test the effects of the newly upgraded Sunflower.  

He removed the Sunflower from the cultivation pot and replanted it in the spirit field. The next day, he harvested a portion of Sun Essence condensed by the Mid-Grade Tier 1 Sunflower.  

Upon absorbing it, Gu Mo couldn't help but smile. The essence granted him the equivalent of three days of cultivation—but now at his mid Qi Refining stage, far surpassing the gains he'd achieved at the early stage.  

Convinced that upgrading the Sunflower enhanced its effects, Gu Mo decided to push the Mid-Grade Tier 1 Sunflower even further.  

Currently, his spirit field housed 15 Sunflowers—the maximum he could conceal. Since quantity couldn't be increased, improving their quality was the best way to boost his cultivation efficiency.  

Moreover, this upgrade would help him determine the Sun Essence requirements for future enhancements.  

He transplanted the Mid-Grade Tier 1 Sunflower back into the cultivation pot and continued feeding it Sun Essence. This time, it took 100 portions to upgrade it to High-Grade Tier 1.  

To his surprise, the upgrade arrow remained.  

High-Grade Tier 1 wasn't the Sunflower's limit—it could still advance further. "Let's see how far you can go," Gu Mo muttered, determined to push it to its peak.  

---  

The Sunflower was, without a doubt, the foundation of Gu Mo's cultivation. The stronger it became, the greater its benefits. Thus, he had no reservations about upgrading it.  

Before proceeding, however, he replanted the High-Grade Tier 1 Sunflower to test its effects. The results delighted him—the condensed Sun Essence now equaled four days of cultivation.  

And this wasn't even its full potential. If planted in a High-Grade Tier 1 spirit field, it might yield five days' worth. Unfortunately, his Mid-Grade Tier 1 spirit field was now a bottleneck.  

Acquiring a higher-grade spirit field was currently difficult unless Gu Mo was willing to reveal some of his secrets—a risky move.  

Since the spirit field couldn't be upgraded, he focused on the Sunflower. After moving the High-Grade Tier 1 Sunflower back into the pot, he resumed feeding it Sun Essence.  

Based on previous patterns—50 portions for the first upgrade, 100 for the second—he estimated the third would require 200. His 14 Sunflowers could gather that in about 14 days.  

As expected, after 200 portions, the arrow turned green again. With a click, the Sunflower ascended to Supreme-Grade Tier 1.  

Yet, the upgrade arrow didn't vanish—it grew larger.  

Gu Mo's heart raced. The next step would break through to Tier 2, entering the Foundation Establishment realm.  

Upgrading from Tier 1 to Tier 2 was a monumental hurdle. Yet, the cultivation pot could achieve this with Sun Essence alone.  

The thought of obtaining a Tier 2 Sunflower at the Qi Refining stage was staggering—its benefits would be immeasurable.  

He tossed in a few portions of Sun Essence, but his expression quickly soured. Unlike before, there was no visible progress.  

This implied an astronomical amount of Sun Essence would be needed for the breakthrough. The dilemma was whether the investment was worth the delay in his cultivation.  

Torn, Gu Mo considered upgrading his other Sunflowers first. But then he realized—a Supreme-Grade Tier 1 Sunflower's condensed essence was several times more potent than that of a Low-Grade one.  

While 50 portions were needed to upgrade a Low-Grade Sunflower to Mid-Grade, a Supreme-Grade's essence could achieve the same with just over a dozen.  

If a Tier 2 Sunflower's essence could upgrade others in a single portion, the efficiency would be unmatched. Moreover, Gu Mo thought ahead to his Foundation Establishment breakthrough—absorbing Tier 2 Sun Essence might significantly aid his progress.  

Given his inferior spiritual roots, breaking through to Foundation Establishment would be exceptionally difficult. Preparing early was essential.  

Resolved, Gu Mo first upgraded all his Sunflowers to Mid-Grade. Their condensed essence would be more effective for breaking through the Supreme-Grade Sunflower than Low-Grade essence. High-Grade was too resource-intensive, and his Mid-Grade spirit field couldn't fully utilize their potential, so he opted against it.

**Green Dew Sect, Main Peak**  

The heart of the sect, the Main Peak was nourished by a Tier 4 Spirit Vein, saturating it with dense spiritual energy. Cultivating here was akin to having a permanent acceleration buff.  

Only sect elders and exceptional inner disciples enjoyed such privileges. Ordinary inner disciples had to settle for the subsidiary peaks, which still boasted Tier 3 Spirit Veins—coveted by countless cultivators.  

In a cave abode halfway up the Main Peak, a handsome young man frowned at a list in his hands.  

He was He Shaogang, the sect master's newly accepted personal disciple.
