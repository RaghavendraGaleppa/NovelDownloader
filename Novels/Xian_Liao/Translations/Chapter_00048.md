# Chapter 48: Sixth Grade

The mournful wailing had just filled the courtyard, lingering briefly in the air.

Suddenly, a tiger's roar erupted from Zhou Qing's room, sweeping through the courtyard like thunder and instantly silencing the eerie sounds. 

Chang Wanli, startled by the disturbance, hurriedly pushed open his guest room door to look into the courtyard. Through the dim light, he saw a familiar figure—pale and dripping wet—resembling the deceased Squire Zhang. The twisting branches of the great mulberry tree seemed to coil like nooses, dragging the ghostly figure into the tree until all traces vanished without a sound.

At that very moment, the sound of recitation came from Zhou Qing's room:

"The way of the Great Learning lies in illuminating virtue, in renewing the people, in resting in the highest excellence..."

The clear, resonant reading voice dispelled the ghostly aura in the courtyard. Chang Wanli was both terrified and confused, wondering if his eyes and ears were playing tricks on him. Yet the steady recitation gradually calmed his mind, making the ghostly apparition and the strange behavior of the mulberry tree seem like nothing more than a vague nightmare. Silently, he closed his door.

The next morning, he saw Zhou Qing practicing martial arts in the courtyard, performing movements resembling those of a tiger, which reminded him of the previous night's roar.

"Good morning, Master Zhou," Chang Wanli greeted respectfully.

Zhou Qing finished his routine with a smile and exchanged pleasantries. Seeing no unusual expression on Zhou Qing's face, Chang Wanli decided not to mention the strange events of the night, fearing it might breach some taboo. His duty completed, he prepared to return to Hengbo County.

After Chang Wanli left, Zhou Qing pondered the events. It seemed Squire Zhang's restless spirit had returned as a ghostly presence, but under the suppression of the tiger's aura, it had been powerless. 

Examining the great mulberry tree, Zhou Qing noticed patches of white on its bark, resembling the color of bones. The monk's corpse had long been completely absorbed by the tree, leaving no trace. The tree was indeed excellent for disposing of evidence, and it now appeared to have developed a new ability—devouring ghosts. 

Zhou Qing recalled tales of soul-summoning banners from his past life. If he ever succeeded in cultivating immortality, this tree could serve as excellent material for dark magical artifacts. 

The tree seemed to sense his thoughts, its leaves trembling slightly as if shivering in fear.

"Just kidding," Zhou Qing reassured it.

Though sometimes, the most honest words were spoken in jest.

He leaped onto the tree's branches using his Shadowless Step technique and practiced the Dragon-Snatching Hand taught by Chang Wanli. Despite being a grappling technique, it required full-body coordination and precise footwork. His Shadowless Step, though primarily a leg technique, incorporated body and foot movements, making the two martial arts complementary.

The great mulberry tree became his new training ground—spacious, densely foliaged, and naturally equipped with obstacles. The flexible branches provided clear feedback, allowing him to adjust his movements. Even if he slipped, his reflexes enabled him to grasp a branch quickly.

As he practiced, Zhou Qing incorporated elements of the Bear Play climbing techniques, finding endless joy in the process. Gradually, he grasped the essence of integrating fist, leg, and grappling techniques—they were not separate but progressive stages of martial mastery. 

With his proficiency in Tiger-Crane Fist and Shadowless Step, his foundation was solid, making the Dragon-Snatching Hand come naturally. Unlike the arduous training of the Bird Play, this progress was swift and smooth.

By late spring, nearly a year after his transmigration, Zhou Qing had reached the "proficient" stage in Dragon-Snatching Hand—an achievement that would astonish Chang Wanli, as even the fastest master in the Immortal Mist Sect had taken five years to reach this level.

Yet Zhou Qing found it only natural. The Tiger and Deer Plays had prepared him for grappling, and mastering the Bear Play made the transition seamless. There were no bottlenecks—just steady progress, even without the aid of Mind Elixirs.

Still, he regretted the lack of sixth-grade ginseng for Blood Qi Pills, as his Bird Play progress was frustratingly slow. He suspected the final play, the Ape Play, would be the most crucial—focusing on refining qi. Each of the Five Animal Plays generated heat that enhanced blood qi and healing, corresponding to the kidneys, liver, spleen, and lungs. The Ape Play, he surmised, would target the heart.

Zhou Qing proposed restoring the alchemy chamber in Qingfu Temple, to which Fushong readily agreed. The temple's financial struggles were evident—Fushong was less adept at fundraising than either Fushan or Zhou Qing. Fortunately, with Zhou Qing's help, the temple's operations stabilized.

The temple's maintenance costs were high due to its numerous bamboo structures built along steep mountain terrain. The lack of disciples meant a shortage of labor. Fushong planned to discuss recruiting local youths as disciples after completing his Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm.

Before he could bring it up, Zhou Qing suggested the same. He proposed selecting ten literate students from his former village school to train as Taoist disciples. With Zhou Qing's connections, obtaining official ordination certificates would be straightforward. These young disciples would soon become valuable assets, helping restore the temple's former glory.

A month later, Taoists from the Taihe Sect arrived, agreeing to Zhou Qing's terms for alchemy cooperation. The restored alchemy chamber was ready, though Fushan remained secluded, pursuing the elusive realm of the innate.

Zhou Qing still hesitated about traveling to the Taihe Sect. Miss Lin proposed an alternative: the Taihe Sect could send materials and recipes to Qingfu Temple, where Zhou Qing would refine the pills under their supervision.

Zhou Qing agreed, though he remained cautious. A full sixth-grade ginseng would tempt him, but a partial one was less appealing. The journey to Xijiang Province was risky—even with escort, bandits posed a real threat.

At sixteen, Zhou Qing preferred caution. The Bird Play could wait. He blamed Fushan's notes for his urgency—thirty was the prime age for martial training. 

He quickly apologized mentally—after all, if Squire Zhang could become a ghost, Fushan might be a vengeful spirit by now. Not that he feared ghosts, but he respected the dead.

He visited his parents' graves in Hu Village annually. The village had recently built a brick kiln, both for income and to construct a fortified stronghold—a wise precaution in turbulent times. 

The stronghold, built under Zhou Qing's name, would serve as a refuge for the village and a base for him. In chaos, bandits were often more disciplined than soldiers. These preparations would take years, but the world wouldn't collapse overnight.

Miss Lin departed to negotiate with the Taihe Sect, while Zhou Qing returned to Qingfu Temple.

Previously, Fushong had always evaded Zhou Qing's requests to use the temple's alchemy chamber. This time, with profits at stake, he couldn't refuse. Zhou Qing planned to refine Blood Qi Pills from the fifth-grade ginseng for Fushong and Zhishan—though past thirty, their martial progress was limited, the pills could help maintain their peak condition.

Last year, Zhou Qing had focused on self-improvement; this year, he began aiding those around him.

Upon inspecting the chamber, however, he understood Fushong's reluctance—it was in ruins, the furnace shattered.

"Elder Brother's doing?"

"Who else?" Fushong sighed.

Closer examination revealed the damage was mostly superficial—only the furnace was destroyed. The chamber's structure remained sound. While Zhou Qing's home setup sufficed for basic alchemy, the temple's chamber, once restored, would be far superior.

With knowledge from the "Spring Revival Talisman Canon," Zhou Qing knew how to repair it. He enlisted Hu Village's brickmakers, whose kiln could produce the necessary materials.

Even if negotiations with the Taihe Sect failed, restoring the chamber was worthwhile. His home was for study and training, but the temple offered better conditions for alchemy—undisturbed and with Fushong's support.

Though unreliable in temperament, Fushong's martial skills were dependable. Lately, he seemed rejuvenated, likely inspired by the Dragon-Snatching Hand. His "Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm" might soon be complete—an opportunity Zhou Qing intended to explore.
