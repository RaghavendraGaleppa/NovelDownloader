# Chapter 3: The Ambitious Vision of Industrial Artifact Refining  

Generally speaking, apart from the mining overseers at the Chiyuan Copper Mine and the Chen Clan's two remaining cultivators, almost no one lived in the Chiyuan Mountain Range.  

Most of the Chen Clan members resided in a county town called Changping.  

Changping County was located on the plains not far from the foot of the Chiyuan Mountain Range. The town was backed by the mountains and faced the twin freshwater lakes of Shuanghu Island—Sun-Moon Lake—while to its right lay the island's deep-water port.  

However, the Wanxing Sea was different from Earth's oceans. Apart from fish, the sea was often frequented by demonic beasts, making it rare for ordinary people to dare fish there. Over time, the deep-water port was largely abandoned.  

Aside from Clan Leader Chen Xianhe occasionally leading a group of clansmen out on a boat to purchase supplies, the port saw little use.  

Changping County had a population of about three thousand, all of whom were members of the Chen Clan.  

This wasn't to say that the Chen Clan had only managed to produce so few descendants in three hundred years. Rather, the island's cultivation resources were scarce, and the number of cultivators in the clan had always been low. By now, only Chen Xianhe and Chen Daoxuan remained.  

In the Wanxing Sea, without enough cultivators for protection, a large population would only become prey for demonic beasts.  

The demonic beast calamity in Changping County ten years ago was a stark example.  

Though the beasts that wreaked havoc back then were only the lowest-tier, unranked demonic beasts, they were still insurmountable threats to ordinary people.  

With only Chen Xianhe to protect them, defending Changping County was an overwhelming task.  

This was the fundamental reason why the Chen Clan's population had never grown.  

Without enough cultivators for protection, they couldn't expand their population. Without a larger population, they couldn't increase the number of clan cultivators. The two factors were interdependent.  

###  

At the Changping County government office, Magistrate Chen Zhi, along with his deputies and other officials, escorted Chen Daoxuan to the gates.  

Looking at the assembled officials, Chen Daoxuan instructed, "Regarding the mining of Chiyuan Copper, the county government must fully cooperate with the overseer of the mine. Negligence will not be tolerated!"  

"By the immortal master's decree!"  

Under the blazing sun, Magistrate Chen Zhi, dressed in his embroidered official robes and sweating profusely, hastily nodded in acknowledgment.  

Satisfied with the magistrate's attitude, Chen Daoxuan relaxed slightly and wasted no further words. He immediately activated his Wind Riding Technique and soared into the sky.  

As they watched him depart, the officials of Changping County couldn't hide their envy.  

###  

With the matter of mining the Chiyuan Copper settled, Chen Daoxuan gradually eased his tense nerves.  

Currently, the Chen Clan had only two cultivators—his thirteenth uncle and himself. Moreover, with Chen Xianhe advanced in age, the pressure on Chen Daoxuan was far greater than what cultivators from other clans could imagine.  

Unless he was willing to abandon his clan and become a rogue cultivator.  

But when he thought of the years of meticulous care his thirteenth uncle had given him—even sacrificing his own path of cultivation for his sake—Chen Daoxuan could never bring himself to forsake his family.  

Soon, Chen Daoxuan descended on a mountain peak not far from his cave abode.  

This peak housed the clan's second most important site after the Chiyuan Mine—the Earthfire Chamber.  

When the Chen Clan's founding ancestor established their base on Shuanghu Island, aside from discovering the Chiyuan Mine, he also found that the island was connected to an underground fire vein.  

For a cultivation force, an earthfire vein was no less important than a minor spirit mine.  

However, harnessing the earthfire vein was no simple task—it required constructing a specialized facility known as an Earthfire Chamber.  

Unfortunately, the Chen Clan's founder had been a mere rogue cultivator, lacking the means to build such a structure.  

It wasn't until the rise of the "Xian" generation, when the clan boasted thirteen cultivators, that they earned the right to construct an Earthfire Chamber through their battlefield achievements.  

In other words, the building before Chen Daoxuan had been standing for no more than a hundred years.  

Of course, without any clan records detailing its exact age, Chen Daoxuan couldn't be sure.  

Taking a deep breath, he pushed open the Earthfire Chamber's heavy bronze doors.  

With a creak, the doors swung open, releasing a wave of scorching heat—reminiscent of the blast furnaces from the steel mills of his past life.  

This was where Chen Daoxuan had spent most of his time over the past five years.  

When the clan built this Earthfire Chamber, their greatest hope had been to nurture an artifact refiner.  

Yet most of the "Xian" generation had devoted their lives to this cause, only to pass away without ever witnessing success.  

Of course, their sacrifices weren't in vain. It was through their battlefield efforts that the clan had obtained both the Earthfire Chamber and a second-tier artifact refining legacy.  

Without their sacrifices, the Chen Clan of Shuanghu Island would never have had the chance to produce an artifact refiner.  

The Earthfire Chamber complex consisted of three buildings.  

The main structure, which Chen Daoxuan had just entered, was where the fire vein converged.  

The two shorter buildings beside it had been constructed under Chen Daoxuan's orders, their plaques bearing the words "Drafting Room" and "Laboratory."  

After routinely inspecting the Earthfire Chamber's formations, Chen Daoxuan exited and entered the laboratory.  

Compared to the sweltering heat of the Earthfire Chamber, the laboratory was much cooler.  

However, unlike the neat and orderly Earthfire Chamber, the laboratory was a mess.  

Various materials—mostly spirit ores used in artifact refining—were scattered everywhere.  

Most striking was the cylindrical object standing prominently in the center of the room, measuring about ten feet in diameter. Its modern, industrial appearance clashed starkly with the ancient aesthetic of the laboratory.  

Had a steelworker from Earth been present, they would have recognized the object as bearing a seventy to eighty percent resemblance to a modern steel smelting furnace.  

But unlike Earth's furnaces, this cylindrical object was engraved with intricate formation patterns, lending it an air of mystique.  

Chen Daoxuan stared at the massive structure with a complicated expression.  

After five full years of failures, he had to admit that he had underestimated the challenge.  

Five years ago, the moment he first encountered the artifact refining legacy, his mind—still shaped by his past life as a mechanical engineer—had immediately sparked with an idea:  

*Could modern industrial production methods be used to increase the output of artifact refining?*  

According to the second-tier refining legacy, artifact refining generally consisted of three stages: extraction, shaping, and formation fusion.  

From what Chen Daoxuan understood, the most time-consuming stage in refining a first-tier magical artifact was extraction.  

Take, for example, the Crimson Shadow Flying Sword, a first-tier flying sword described in the legacy.  

The primary material for refining it was Chiyuan Copper—the very ore the Chen Clan possessed in abundance.  

Yet extracting the copper alone required three days and nights of continuous work.  

In contrast, the subsequent shaping and formation fusion stages were relatively quick, usually taking only about an hour each.  

This meant that even refining the most basic first-tier, low-grade flying sword required an artifact refiner to work nonstop in the Earthfire Chamber for three days and nights.  

This severely limited production efficiency!  

To Chen Daoxuan, with his background in mechanical engineering, such a purely manual production method was nothing short of slow suicide.
