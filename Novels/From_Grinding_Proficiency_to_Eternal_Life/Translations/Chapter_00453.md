# Chapter 453: The Decline of Zhenwu Peak's Business

"It's truly pitiful," he muttered with a slight shake of his head, feeling somewhat puzzled. His Zhenwu Peak had also opened a lending business, yet very few disciples had come to take out loans.

Was it because the number of disciples recruited to Zhenwu Peak over the years was too small?

He would have to discuss this with his master, Bi Yuan, and the others later. It wouldn't hurt to slightly relax the entry restrictions for the peak. After all, they were all disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect. Even if their moral character was somewhat lacking, the important thing was that the lending business needed to take off.

Unfortunately, if these disciples borrowed too much, even if they desperately cultivated to the Qi Condensation Great Perfection, the meager amount of spirit stones they earned in the end probably wouldn't even be enough to pay the interest.

Along the path of cultivation, one naturally believes they have a genuine chance of reaching Foundation Establishment.

They are unaware that in the eyes of the Foundation Establishment Masters of the Primordial Origin Sect, they are nothing more than walking spirit stone mines.

Looking at the Qi Condensation disciples hurrying about within the pass, Xu Yunfan secretly shook his head.

The Primordial Origin Sect had thirty-six peaks, and the inheritance of each lineage had its own fixed quota.

The Cold Marrow Peak specialized in cultivating the Nine Nether Ice, the Soul Refining Peak focused on soul-devouring secret techniques, and the Blood Fiend Peak delved into the path of blood refinement.

The number of Foundation Establishment positions for each lineage was fixed.

However, who among cultivators doesn't want to advance further, using their lineage to support their cultivation?

Naturally, this leads to the expansion of their lineages.

To expand their own lineages, which Foundation Establishment Master of the peaks doesn't desperately open their gates wide and recruit disciples in large numbers?

The Ice Soul Master of the Cold Marrow Peak had over a hundred nominal disciples under his name alone.

The Blackheart Old Freak of the Soul Refining Peak was even more exaggerated; including the labor disciples, there were probably nearly two thousand people eating from his hand.

The resources of the sect were limited.

Spirit veins, blessed lands, pills, magical artifacts, secret techniques and cultivation methods—which of these wasn't a case of too many monks and not enough porridge?

The elders were shrewd. They would recruit people first and worry about the rest later. After all, nominal disciples didn't count towards the official quota. They could be sent off with a few inferior spirit stones each month.

If there was someone with exceptional talent? Then they would set up a "True Disciple Trial" and let the disciples fight to the death for it.

As for those with average aptitude...

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over several Qi Condensation disciples transporting Yin Fiend Stones under the city wall. Their hands were wrapped in blood-soaked cloth strips, yet they gritted their teeth and persisted.

These people were mostly "discards" from various peaks, exiled to this Cold Crow Pass to do hard labor.

"The path of cultivation is narrow, and the bridge to it is perilous," he softly sighed.

Within this Primordial Origin Sect, ninety-nine percent of disciples were destined to become stepping stones on someone else's path to immortality.

Those like him, who entered the Dao through martial arts and ultimately achieved Foundation Establishment, were one in ten thousand.

The night wind howled, carrying wails from the depths of the River of Netherworld. Xu Yunfan suddenly felt that compared to the inhuman loan contracts of the Primordial Origin Sect, the Yin Fiend Qi of Cold Crow Pass seemed much gentler.

In a place where he was the only Foundation Establishment Master, his will was the will of heaven.

To let them live was to let them live; to let them die...

It was just tossing a few more corpses into the River of Netherworld.

He suddenly remembered the meaningful words of his Senior Brother Baiyue before his departure: "Cold Crow Pass is dangerous, but it's also a... good place to make some extra profit."

Now it seemed, those words were not false.

To survive, these Qi Condensation disciples would probably be willing to offer even their lifeblood.

Suddenly, he noticed an inconspicuous old cultivator in a corner. The man seemed on the verge of death.

The old cultivator seemed to sense something and looked up, forcing an obsequious smile at Xu Yunfan. All his teeth were surprisingly black. He bowed low to the ground, not daring to move in the slightest.

"Greetings, Master!"

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. Late-stage Qi Condensation.

Unfortunately, his lifespan was nearing its end, and his soul withered. Without a great opportunity, this would be the end of his path.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over the old cultivator without lingering for a moment.

A trace of relief flashed across the old cultivator's wrinkled face, and his hunched back relaxed imperceptibly.

Within the Primordial Origin Sect, for an outer sect cultivator like him without any backing, the greatest favor he could receive from a superior was often being ignored. If a Foundation Establishment Master took an interest in you, whether it was because they fancied a magical artifact you possessed or coveted the vital essence you had cultivated for years, that would be a true disaster.

Cultivators like this old man, having been steeped in the Primordial Origin Sect for too long, knew that if Xu Yunfan had so much as nodded, the man probably wouldn't sleep well for months. Thus, Xu Yunfan simply couldn't be bothered to pay him any mind.

The old cultivator's turbid eyes shifted slightly, his peripheral vision catching several Qi Condensation disciples gathering Yin Fiend by the River of Netherworld. Their trembling appearance reminded him of himself sixty years ago.

Back then, if he hadn't been too conspicuous and "favored" by a certain Foundation Establishment Master, he wouldn't have had to resort to destroying his own foundation to avoid disaster.

"Being ignored is the best form of regard," the old cultivator murmured to himself.

His palm, mottled with age spots, subconsciously touched the dull-looking storage bag at his waist. Inside were thirty-seven spirit stones he had secretly saved over the years—his entire fortune, prepared to bribe the guards at the pass to get transferred away from Cold Crow Pass.

At that time, he would go to the mortal world and take a few wives, allowing his bloodline to flourish. In the future, a Master might emerge from his lineage to guide him out of the cycle of reincarnation and set him on the path of cultivation once more.

A Yin wind swirled past the city wall, kicking up a few枯骨 (dried bones) from the banks of the River of Netherworld.

Xu Yunfan had already turned and left, his dark Dao robe billowing in the wind.

The old cultivator watched that receding figure, and a rare trace of tranquility appeared on his wrinkled face.

In this Primordial Origin Sect that devours people without spitting out the bones, any outer sect cultivator who has lived to his age understands one principle.

Being forgotten by a Foundation Establishment Master is sometimes the greatest blessing.

Xu Yunfan didn't linger either. After entering Cold Crow Pass, he had intended to first find the former garrison commander to hand over official duties. However, just as he stepped over the threshold of the central hall, he saw a grey shadow flash past a side door in a hurry.

The figure was so fast it almost left an afterimage, as if being chased by a vengeful ghost.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. He could naturally distinguish the other party's aura.

It was the former garrison commander, Li Wei, a Foundation Establishment Master under another True Lord's faction.

"Master Li, please wait! What matter makes you so hurried?"

Xu Yunfan called out loudly.

The figure paused slightly but did not turn back. It only tossed a sentence from afar: "Master Xu, as the new official taking office, all affairs of Cold Crow Pass are recorded in the jade slip on the desk! This Master... ahem, has an urgent matter at home, so I shall take my leave first!"

Before the words had fully faded, the person had already transformed into a streak of light and vanished into the vast night.

Xu Yunfan stared at that fleeting streak of light, feeling completely baffled. However, it seemed something was amiss.

Could it be that he had been left a烂摊子 (a mess)?

This predecessor had fled faster than a startled rabbit. It reminded him of the rumors about Cold Crow Pass in the mortal world. It was said that among all the garrison commanders who had served here, the shortest tenure lasted only ten years before they resigned and left.

The current Li Wei was also known within the Primordial Origin Sect for his resilient temperament. Even so, he had stubbornly held on for twenty years before receiving the True Lord's approval.

Now that Xu Yunfan had come, he had left in such a frantic hurry.

"It seems this post is even more troublesome than I imagined," he thought.

He scanned the hall. The Qi Condensation disciples on duty within Cold Crow Pass were all looking at the new garrison commander with slightly tense expressions.
