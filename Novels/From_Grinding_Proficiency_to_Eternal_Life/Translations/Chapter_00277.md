# Chapter 277: The Demon Approaches

As the blood qi around Xu Yunfan gradually receded, Bi Yuan showed no displeasure; instead, a hint of admiration flashed through his eyes.

This young man before him did not merely know how to train死板ly; he had experienced countless life-and-death battles, often defeating opponents from higher realms, thereby nurturing such a sharp and piercing aura within him.

Facing a supreme grandmaster like Bi Yuan, who was at the Ninth Realm of Qi Cultivation, Xu Yunfan remained composed and unperturbed. His blood qi surged, and his physical strength was not suppressed or hindered in the slightest.

Ordinary martial artists would have their blood qi stagnated just standing before Bi Yuan, yet the fighting spirit between Xu Yunfan's eyebrows was as sharp as a drawn sword.

"What a bold spirit to draw your blade against the strong!"

Bi Yuan suddenly clapped his hands and laughed, his voice shaking the beams of the hall. "With such a temperament, you are worthy of the words 'Inherit the Ancient, Succeed the Sage.' Even in the era of the Hundred Schools of Thought two thousand years ago, you would be comparable to those ancient sages who founded their own schools and sects."

However, the clarity in Xu Yunfan's eyes never wavered.

He noticed that the star patterns subtly embroidered on Bi Yuan's sleeves were slowly shifting. The latter's true qi was as deep and vast as an ocean; a casual strand of it flowing made one feel as if he were a towering mountain, impossible to ignore.

Every word of praise from this Sect Master was accompanied by a probing of true qi, as if weighing the quality of a peerless divine weapon.

When Bi Yuan mentioned "comparable to the great sages," Xu Yunfan even felt a slight tremor from his dragon scale armor, as if warning him of some obscure spiritual induction.

"You flatter me, Senior."

As Xu Yunfan cupped his fists in salute, the "Lin Character Mantra" was already silently activated within him. The majestic golden statue of his own deity deep in his Sea of Consciousness suddenly burst forth with brilliant light, suppressing all the restless blood qi in his meridians.

This was not Bi Yuan's intentional doing. This Sect Master of the Dao Sect, who had been famous throughout the world for two full甲子 (120 years), had long since reached the marvelous realm of "Spirit Merging with the Dao." Such a long time had already made Bi Yuan transcend the mundane and reach an inconceivable level.

Bi Yuan seemed to sense something and apologetically withdrew his aura.

He pondered for a moment and suddenly asked, "Young friend, do you know the current situation of the world?"

Xu Yunfan replied, "The Empress of Great Zhou, that lofty 'Sage and Enlightened Monarch,' has, since ascending the throne, used 'purging rebels' as an excuse to slaughter thirty-six million common people as a blood sacrifice, seeking to live another life! That Guo Lang of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau aids the wicked, and the military departments are commanded everywhere. The blood sacrifices have stained more than twenty provinces."

Speaking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but recall the Xianghuo Sect and the one hundred thousand Xuanjia Army that were manipulated back in Cangzhou and Wuzhou. Even though he was not from this world, he still felt a surge of anger.

"The blood river in Qingzhou did not disperse for three days, and outside the Jade Capital Dao, white bones formed towers. Yet that witch sits steadily on the dragon throne, turning a blind eye to the beacons of war in the Six Paths! She deserves to die."

His tone suddenly shifted to the north, and Xu Yunfan's eyes revealed the tragic scenes in the snowy winds of Yanbei Dao: "Then there are the True Blood of the Great Qin Dynasty, those nobles who claim to possess 'True Blood.' They no longer see the commoners as their own kind! The intoxicated expressions on the faces of those nobles when they drink the heart blood of young boys and girls mixed with cinnabar... are exactly the same as when that female demon carves out the blood of the common people for sacrifice—they are all the same group of evil ghosts!"

"The Great Qin Dynasty, in terms of bloodline, considers those with True Blood to be the upper nobility, sustained by the common people at the bottom. The two have become two distinct classes and species, with the bottom layer having no chance of rising. The actions of the True Blood nobles, while not involving large-scale slaughter, are essentially no different from that female demon's during each ritual."

At this point, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but add, "The Nine耀 Sect is indeed one of the six top sects of Great Zhou. Holding three provinces of Yanbei Dao, they have blocked the Great Qin army to the point where they cannot advance an inch. A few days ago, three Grand Elders left the mountain and slaughtered one hundred thousand Great Qin soldiers, shocking the world."

Bi Yuan listened noncommittally and suddenly said, "Three days ago, urgent news came from Yanbei Dao. The Great Qin Royal Court unleashed six national guardian divine weapons and dispatched nine True Blood experts comparable to Qi Cultivation practitioners, the Purity Realm, to massacre the Nine耀 Sect's mountain gate."

"The Nine耀 Burning Heaven Array, which had just regained some of its power due to the recovery of spiritual energy, was broken. The Tianquan Peak collapsed, and Zhou Tianyan's master, the Qi Cultivation supreme grandmaster known as the 'Ancestor of Burning Heaven,' was nailed to death in front of the Ancestral Hall with an ancient bronze halberd."

Xu Yunfan's heart trembled. His first reaction was not shock but inexplicable joy. If this news were true, wouldn't there be no restrictions on his cultivation of the Nine耀 Ten Capital True Strength?

"The change of dynasties and the suppression of sects are merely scabies and sores."

Watching Xu Yunfan's facial expressions change, Bi Yuan thought Xu Yunfan was somewhat angry. A scroll of ancient-looking silk cloth slipped from his sleeve, on which the four characters "Qingwei Dao Zang" were extremely ancient.

"My Dao Sect has experienced twenty-seven great calamities of heaven and earth and has long understood the cycle of the Dao: 'long unity must lead to division.' The true calamity..."

Bi Yuan suddenly raised his finger and pointed to the vast sky outside the hall.

"...lies in those 'anchors' hanging above our heads."

Bi Yuan continued, "Do you know why my Dao Sect went to great lengths to shatter the small world secret realms?"

Xu Yunfan casually replied, "Wouldn't it be to prevent demons from running out of the secret realms?"

A hint of a smile appeared on Bi Yuan's face. "Yes, and no."

He pointed upwards. "Secret realms are the anchors of the Heavenly Demons."

"Heavenly Demons?"

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. He instantly remembered the Primordial Secret Technique used by Jiang Xu and the strange gaze Yu Congling had when she mentioned "breaking through the cage" and looked into the void. The Jiang Xu and the remnant will Yu Congling within the extreme path remains that he encountered in the secret realm were clearly not from this world.

Bi Yuan's voice seemed to grind through the abyss, carrying the weight of ages: "The Sixth, Thirty-second, Forty-third... Sect Masters of my Dao Sect, down to the Fifty-second Sect Master two thousand years ago..."

He tapped the table with his knuckles, each sound seeming to strike the bones of fate. "凡登临九境练气之巅者，皆被天魔……生生抹去。” (Those who reached the pinnacle of the Ninth Realm of Qi Cultivation were all... wiped out by the Heavenly Demons.)

At this point, Bi Yuan seemed somewhat uncertain and slowly said, "Perhaps they were not wiped out. An ancestor in the Dao Sect's library once witnessed it with his own eyes; it seemed they were... taken away..."

He suddenly rose, his black robe billowing like clouds hanging from the sky, and strode out of the hall.

Golden clouds churned in the distant sky, but the sea of clouds seemed like congealed blood scabs.

Bi Yuan's pupils reflected that eerie celestial light, and the words squeezed from his throat were colder than a blade: "The calamity that should have been three hundred years later has actually been torn open ahead of schedule by that Empress..."

A sudden yin wind swept past. He raised his head and looked towards the firmament, as if gazing directly at some indescribable gaze.

He spoke word by word, each word shaking one's heart:

"...The Heavenly Demons... are coming."

Three days had passed since Xu Yunfan's conversation with the Dao Sect Master Bi Yuan.

The morning mist had not yet dispersed, but dull, thunder-like sounds were already echoing on the bluestone terrace of the Shenxiao Peak.

Xu Yunfan's arm muscles were like old vines twisting steel as he swung the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, tracing a dark rainbow. The opening stance of the Nine Profound亢 Dragon Mace, the "Azure Dragon Shakes its Scales," was suddenly unleashed.
