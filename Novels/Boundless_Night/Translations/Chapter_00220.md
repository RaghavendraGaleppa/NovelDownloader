**Chapter 220: The Secret Realm Journey Concludes (Merged Chapters)**

A cup of tea sat on Qin Ming's desk, a reward he had earned after defeating Sun Jingxiao. However, he had no need for it at the moment.

"Cui Chonghe." Qin Ming frowned. Hearing that name immediately soured his mood.

Most of the pressure he currently felt and the grudges he bore were related to the Cui family. For instance, early on, Li Qingxu targeted him, trying to kill him, precisely because he was impersonating the Cui family's legitimate son. Throughout the whole ordeal, he was a massive scapegoat, suffering on someone else's behalf, only to be troubled by the Cui family afterward.

As for the true mastermind, Cui Chonghe, he held an even loftier attitude, viewing Qin Ming as a servant raised by the Cui family, believing it was only right for him to die in his stead and endure tribulations.

Now, the Cui and Li families had ceased hostilities, yet Qin Ming was still constantly being implicated. From the Cui family's attempt to kill him in the remote Black and White Mountains, to hiring Yu Zhuohan of the Esoteric Sect to duel him, and then to their suspected interference in the Six Imperial Ancestral Courtyard's disciple selection – every single event infuriated Qin Ming. When he was aboard the Vermilion Bird airship, he was even attacked by the old woman guarding the "land" in the sky. After the "shattered for peace" incident, his hatred for the Cui family had reached an extreme.

"Is it a real fight? I really want to test him out," Qin Ming said.

His resentment towards the Cui family had accumulated to a certain point. Even when they tried to be "conciliatory" towards him, they would immediately suggest he become Cui Chonghe's bodyguard. Even Cui He and Cui Shuning, who had lost the *Yi Mu Scripture* to him, believed that he was already too far behind to even qualify as a Jade-Armored Guard or Divine-Armored Guard, thinking that as a 'newborn', his cultivation speed was far too slow to keep up with the near-immortal seed, Cui Chonghe. Even if he ran at full speed from behind, he would barely catch a glimpse of his back.

"Hmm, I'm getting carried away. How can I cultivate with an unsettled mind? I must calm myself." Qin Ming realized that whenever the Cui family was mentioned, his temper flared particularly violently.

The Sky Demon Mirror, in a cold and detached voice, informed him that Cui Chonghe's challenge was related to his innate talent.

"I just mastered the *Golden Cicada Scripture*, and my body is undergoing a rebirth because of it. It would be a pity not to have a real fight," Qin Ming said, feeling quite disappointed. He naturally knew that Cui Chonghe was exceptionally gifted, having been sent to the Outsider's Pure Land at the age of three and having already entered the Dao. His cultivation realm surpassed that of his peers.

"Let him wait until my rebirth is complete," Qin Ming said.

Half a day later, his body was no longer scalding hot, and the transformation was completely finished. Subsequently, he began to integrate the Golden Cicada Strength, using the "Dragon-Tiger Fusion" method, repeatedly refining and tempering it. His flesh and blood glowed like crystal, and a great pill appeared in his chest and abdomen, then took on a human form... before bursting open and surging to all parts of his body, causing lightning and thunder to flash throughout the entire palace. He felt incredibly complete. After integrating the seventh miraculous technique, this was a rebirth for his Heavenly Light Strength! He experienced the changes within himself, feeling incredibly powerful, wishing he could pummel Cao Qianqiu once more in the first realm.

"Indeed, the records from various sources were not false. The higher one's initial foundation on the Rebirth Path and the deeper their accumulation, the greater the rewards received during the ninth rebirth." Qin Ming now understood why "relay rebirth" existed. He speculated that some patriarchs might have experienced it as well.

Ninety percent of the youngsters who entered the Secret Realm were digging for spiritual herbs, while the seed-level figures who could embark on the journey found their opportunities not in the real world.

"Eh, another Immortal Path is approaching the Demonic Path!" someone exclaimed, surprised by this scene. Immediately, this caused a sensation. People knew that the young demon "Demon One" was about to make a name for himself throughout the Night Mist World! Within a single day, he consecutively clashed with near-immortal seeds. Regardless of the outcome, this was a magnificent feat.

"That's Cui Chonghe!" someone exclaimed. In mid-air, a shimmering Immortal Path, bathed in clouds and colorful mists, merged with the Demonic Path. Upon it stood a grand palace, with a figure standing at its entrance. Cui Chonghe's feathered robes fluttered, fine white mist swirling around him, dots of light rain flowing. He seemed to have severed all mortal ties, transcending the mundane world.

Although they couldn't see clearly, some disciples from the Outsider's Pure Land recognized him. "It really is Senior Brother Cui; he stepped forward at the crucial moment, so responsible!" someone praised. Cui Chonghe was extremely famous. He had achieved enlightenment in the Pure Land at the age of three, and many people said that he would undoubtedly become a near-immortal in the future, ultimately seeking true enlightenment.

The Immortal Path disciples instantly became active, as if they were standing on clouds, feeling a sense of honor. "What is extraordinary talent? Senior Brother Cui can be considered one of its prime examples. It's said that he might possess a foundation surpassing even the Patriarchs who pioneered the path; in the future, he's bound to be a world-shaking figure!" "I've also heard that Senior Brother Cui's talent is astonishing and unparalleled, possessing an innate gift that surpasses the Path-Pioneering Patriarchs!" Not long ago, the Immortal Path seeds had suffered two consecutive defeats, which truly hurt morale and caused these disciples to fall silent. Now, however, they were all excited and agitated.

The demonic side's expressions slightly changed, showing a hint of worry. Recently, the situation on the plateau had been very tense. As the opposing faction, this group of young demons had naturally researched the famous figures in the enemy camp. Some demons also knew Cui Chonghe. "This isn't good. If he truly possesses talent that surpasses the Path-Pioneering Patriarchs, then we're in trouble!"

To everyone's surprise, the young man on the Demonic Path did not show himself at all; he did not step out of his own palace. It wasn't a close-quarters battle, so Qin Ming couldn't be bothered to meet Cui Chonghe.

"Good! A prodigy of our demon race should have such prestige! What about the figurehead of this generation's Immortal Path? If he says he won't meet, then he won't meet!" Many demons felt that Demon One had character and should act this way. The Immortal Path disciples were immediately displeased, finding the demon seed too arrogant, to not even step out of the grand palace's gate; it was truly audacious.

"Is Cui Chonghe really as strong as rumored?" people from the Esoteric Sect were also discussing.

"Hard to say, but from all indications, he should be extremely powerful."

***

Qin Ming sat quietly in the Demonic Palace, asking the Sky Demon Mirror how the opponent intended to compete.

The Sky Demon Mirror informed him: "On the path ahead, there are riddles left by past cultivators who embarked on this journey. He has also left one here for you to solve. If you succeed, you win."

Qin Ming had a realization and asked, "If I fail, can I send him a riddle in return for him to solve?"

"That is correct."

This broken mirror had different names on different paths; on the Immortal Path, it was naturally called the Immortal Mirror.

At this moment, Cui Chonghe stood on the Immortal Path, hands clasped behind his back, gazing into the distance. The opponent's non-appearance didn't anger him; he merely smiled faintly. "This is it. If he can master this, then I lose." He pointed a finger, and intricate words and patterns appeared, manifesting in the void. Through the Sky Demon Mirror's manifestation, eventually, Qin Ming's jade table glowed brightly, inscribed with the full text and illustrations.

"This is outrageous!" Qin Ming's expression darkened. His earlier suspicions were now confirmed. This was the first realm's Rebirth technique, which originally belonged to him. The old silk manuscript had simply been withheld by the Cui family and had yet to be returned. One could imagine that even the most extraordinarily talented individuals of the Cui family had studied his family's silk manuscript, and even Cui Chonghe, who walked the Immortal Path, knew its profound meaning.

Immediately, Qin Ming suspected that this person might also be cultivating Heavenly Light Strength, having walked more than one path, and likely possessing strong talents in various fields. No one knew the situation of the silk manuscript technique better than he did. Cui Chonghe had indeed presented him with a difficult problem.

"Could he be suspecting me and doing this on purpose? No, that shouldn't be the case."

Qin Ming's brows furrowed deeply. If he were to practice the silk manuscript technique here, the consequences would be severe. Not only would Cao Qianqiu be after him, but his identity would likely be exposed, and the Demonic Path would no longer be able to conceal him. Qin Ming's expression wasn't pleasant. It was truly difficult to feel cheerful when facing the Cui family. Should he also take out a supreme sect-suppressing art to trouble Cui Chonghe? How could he? Wouldn't that be aiding the enemy? Cui Chonghe had displayed it because he was certain that no one could cultivate the silk manuscript technique on their own.

"I'll also write one and let him study it. If he can master it, I lose." Qin Ming swiftly wrote characters in the void with Heavenly Light Strength.

When Cui Chonghe saw the text and illustrations, his smile instantly froze. He frowned and said, "This works too? Isn't that against the rules?" The other party had simply copied the essence of the silk manuscript technique's first realm, word for word, and sent it back.

The Immortal Mirror's voice was unperturbed: "He believes this technique is flawed and impassable. You are misleading him with incorrect principles. Please practice it yourself first."

"I walk the Immortal Path," Cui Chonghe said.

Qin Ming retorted, "Since you don't understand the Demonic Path and its Rebirth technique, don't show off. I'm telling you, this cultivation method has issues. Do you disagree?"

This confrontation was much ado about nothing. Although it ended in a draw, it felt more like an unresolved matter. "'Useless sparring and exchange. No rewards will be given to either party. Should this happen again, there will be direct punishment.' This was the Sky Demon Mirror's assessment."

Finally, Cui Chonghe flicked his wide sleeve and departed, highly displeased. Qin Ming also didn't smile; this outcome didn't meet his expectations. The Cui family hadn't treated his family's inherited silk manuscript with any respect, casually pulling it out for a duel with someone and still not returning it to him, filling him with an added surge of vexation. He sat there quietly, declaring in a deep voice, "This matter cannot end amicably. I will definitely pay them a visit and fight!"

"'Someone has challenged you...'" the Sky Demon Mirror transmitted.

"'It's not another person from the Immortal Path, is it? Is there no end to this?'" Qin Ming was already in a bad mood, and now he naturally felt the urge to engage in a big fight.

"'Yes, it's someone from the Immortal Path – Li Qingyue,' the Sky Demon Mirror informed him."

"'Ah, well, in that case, no problem, let's spar,' Qin Ming immediately said."

The Sky Demon Mirror said, "She wishes to discuss the Dao."

"No problem," Qin Ming said with a smile, nodding.

The Sky Demon Mirror remarked, "Brave descendant who pioneers the path, you are so friendly even to your competitors, showing no killing intent. This is commendable."

Qin Ming smiled and said, "Indeed, I also yearn for the Immortal Path and desire to sit and discuss the Dao. Moreover, I've already caused quite a stir. If I continue engaging in real combat, it won't just be 'Heaven envying heroic talent'; even Cao Qianqiu and Sun Taichu might personally arrive to 'convert' me."

"What's going on?" Outside, some people were surprised. The Immortal Path and the Demonic Path separated, neither suffering any damage, having safely concluded this round. Soon, people speculated: could this have ended in a draw?

"Hiss, Senior Brother Cui should possess the qualifications of a Path-Pioneering Patriarch, yet he could only maintain an undefeated record, with no hope of victory?"

"Demon One will henceforth become renowned far and wide, having successively defeated Li Qingxu and Sun Jingxiao, and then forcing Cui Chonghe to a draw. He truly possesses the qualifications of a Demon God!"

Clearly, many people were still unaware that Li Qingxu's master, Cao Qianqiu, had once fought on his behalf. Those who truly knew the inside story were now silent, not daring to comment excessively on the matter.

Immediately after, people saw another Immortal Path approaching the Demonic Path, connecting with it. This time, all factions in the Secret Realm erupted in excitement. Especially the demon race, who were practically in ecstasy, as if their own lives had reached their peak at this moment.

Was this young demon facing all the immortal seeds alone, one against many? Up to this point, he had not suffered a single defeat.

"Li Qingyue! It's actually her! She has no background, entered the Outsider's Pure Land just over two years ago, and climbed up entirely by her own strength, obtaining near-immortal artifacts and being recognized by the old fogeys, becoming an immortal seed." Someone spotted the figure amidst the ethereal mist: dressed in white, with black hair fluttering, standing before a grand palace.

"Fairy Li truly has courage. Even with Cui Chonghe not winning and the match ending in a draw, she still dared to step forward, possessing a powerful conviction of 'who but me!'"

"As expected of an immortal seed who fought her way up step by step from among numerous disciples; her will is firm, and she fears nothing!"

When Li Qingyue appeared at this moment, she was immediately praised by many Immortal Path disciples. Immediately after, the two grand palaces in the sky rapidly approached each other, emitting brilliant light that enveloped the area. Daoist aura flowed, and nothing could be seen.

After several months, Qin Ming saw Li Qingyue again and rose to greet her in the Demonic Palace. She was dressed in white, without makeup, her face exquisitely flawless. Standing there, she was like a bright moon emerging from the clouds, and the white silk ribbon tied around her slender, soft waist gently fluttered.

"Fairy Li, please be seated!" Qin Ming spoke. Even though they were very familiar with each other, he still adhered to the rules, fearing to cause any trouble in front of the Sky Demon Mirror.

Li Qingyue nodded, her white robes purer than snow. Her entire being seemed to glow from head to toe, illuminating the Demonic Palace. Her exquisite form was pure and ethereal, of unparalleled elegance. Even Qin Ming had the illusion of a certain distance between them, feeling that she would ultimately sever all mortal ties and ascend to the heavens.

Li Qingyue smiled and said, "The Immortal Path cannot afford to lose again; it must win. If I lose, or if it's a draw, I will personally give you an item." Then, the two formally began to discuss Dharma, debate profound meanings, argue which was stronger, the Demonic Path or the Immortal Path, and which held greater advantage, Heavenly Light Strength or Consciousness Spirit Light—a proper discussion of the Dao.

Without a doubt, Li Qingyue had recognized him! As their discussion deepened, the two stopped their pretense and began to discuss truly profound principles. Qin Ming explained the *Fate Altering Scripture* to her, elucidating his insights. Li Qingyue had once taught him a mysterious scripture in the Mountain River Spirit Nest, capable of cultivating Consciousness Spirit Light. Now, she focused on expounding this scripture, then continued to explain its subsequent chapters. By the end, both felt they had gained much. Moreover, when discussing the confrontation between Heavenly Light Strength and Consciousness Spirit Light, they both showed thoughtful expressions, seriously pondering various combat scenarios.

As time passed, the outside world grew anxious. The two paths had not yet separated, and the two figures had not reappeared. "Fairy Li won't have met with trouble, will she?" some people worried, given how fierce that young demon was. "What kind of competition are they having? Why aren't they showing themselves?"

A long time later, Li Qingyue rose in the grand palace and said, "I have benefited greatly. How about we conclude this as a draw?"

"I couldn't ask for more," Qin Ming replied. He sighed softly. He and this old acquaintance truly met rarely and parted often. The outside world felt a long time had passed, but in reality, it hadn't been that long yet. Moreover, it wasn't appropriate for them to say too much here.

"I said that if I didn't win, I would give you an item." Li Qingyue handed him a crystal of extremely high purity, which sealed a great pill within.

"This is..." Qin Ming was astonished. It was the size of a longan fruit, split into two colors, black on the left and white on the right. Faintly, one could see the swirling phantom images of a dragon and a tiger. It actually carried a peculiar phenomenon. He immediately knew what it was: a Dragon-Tiger Grand Pill! In the past, at the Mount Luofu Immortal Mountain ruins, Li Qingyue had used her Spirit Eyes to discover Cui Chonghe's possession and illegal participation in the battle. She had exposed him, threatened him, and demanded the Dragon-Tiger Elixir, forcing him to comply. This was a grand elixir personally refined by Sun Taichu, who had collected various heavenly materials and earthly treasures.

Li Qingyue said, "The Dharma is incomplete, and the path is not yet fully trodden; all paths are still imperfect. In this grand era, every path is expanding forward. I hope that in the future, your path can flourish and open up new Daoist routes. When the path ahead is blocked, this pill can temporarily pave the way and increase your cultivation speed." She subtly informed Qin Ming of the pill's function. It wasn't for him to consume now. The first realm of the Rebirth Path progressed rapidly, even faster than other paths, but upon reaching the second realm, there was a cliff-like drop-off. She was worried about his future path, thus giving him the Dragon-Tiger Grand Pill, hoping he could go further and that his progress wouldn't slow down too much. However, this great pill would only be useful at a certain juncture. Thus, she ultimately could only sigh.

Qin Ming watched her depart, her figure gradually blurring until she vanished into the depths of the palace on the Immortal Path. Undoubtedly, Li Qingyue was very good to him in this way. However, Qin Ming found himself in a daze, because she had become even more ethereal, wholeheartedly dedicated to the Dao and becoming near-immortal. He recalled Wang Caiwei's words: one day, Li Qingyue would no longer set foot in the mortal world, and they would be difficult to meet again.

"In the future, she will either lead the Outsider's Lands to ultimate glory, transforming all blessed lands into grotto-heavens and leaping across the void. Or she will lead everyone from the Outsider's Lands to perish in the depths of the Night Mist World during the Great Genesis Era, with their path cut off." Although Qin Ming didn't want to believe those words, seeing Li Qingyue as she was now, he couldn't help but make the connection, because he always felt she was drifting further away. To Qin Ming, Li Qingyue was perfect in every way. Yet, he recalled what the Sky Demon Mirror had mentioned—that excessive perfection bordered on destruction—and couldn't help but frown.

"Ultimately, my cultivation is insufficient, and I'm prone to overthinking. If I can smash Cao Qianqiu to bits in the real world, what is there to worry about? What's so terrifying about the depths of the Night Mist World? I'll just carve my way straight through it."

***

Outside, a group of people were in a daze. After the two paths separated this time, they had each expanded slightly. Though not by much, one could clearly see shimmering light rising and the Daoist aura growing denser.

"Was this also a draw?"

Previously, Cui Chonghe's draw had caused no ripples. Why was there such a phenomenon now? "'Discussing the Dao, though ending in a draw, both parties gained something, thus rewards are granted.' This was the Sky Demon Mirror's assessment." It sent out two cups of tea, one for each, deeming this a meaningful spar and exchange.

Qin Ming settled his mind. On this path, he burned incense, drank tea, and meditated on a futon, comprehending the several miraculous techniques he had mastered, once again cultivating new killer moves, such as the Blazing Fire Shuttle and the Earthly Seal. At the same time, he took the opportunity to practice the *Undying Butterfly Scripture* here. As expected, he also obtained the original demonic version, which was supplemented by the Sky Demon Mirror. However, he did not refine any more demonic seeds, fearing he would be kicked off this path. Then, he went to the Rebirth Path, searching for opportunities along the way. Thus, he repeatedly switched between the two paths, rushing forward.

During this period, no one challenged him again, because everyone already knew that he was not to be trifled with, and approaching him might only lead to self-humiliation.

"A single person from our demon race can contend against all the path seeds!" a demon boasted.

"Looking across the entire Night Mist World, he might even be the strongest young demon seed!"

"Forget it. While Demon One is strong, I doubt he'll make it into the top three, because some people in there are too special. It's suspected that some Demon Ancestors are re-treading their old paths. If that's the case, who could contend against them?"

The outside world was tumultuous, but none of it concerned Qin Ming. He focused solely on traversing the path, then entered the riddle zone, looking at the entire wall covered in writings, and he also tried to solve them. Finally, he discovered that some riddles were definitely left by great figures. This was not just a path for youngsters; even giants had once passed through here. Some of the unsolved problems were too profound to comprehend. Moreover, different paths presented different questions, as if spanning realms, truly making it difficult for later comers.

Later on, Qin Ming vaguely saw a broken path, with dense mist ahead, making it difficult to proceed. After his ninth rebirth, his eyes underwent a transformation. When he concentrated, a warm current surged, allowing him to penetrate the mist-shrouded area. Just ahead, there was a massive cicada palace, even larger than a colossal mountain. Qin Ming was stunned. Upon closer inspection, it was less a grand palace and more an original cicada exuviae, which had been decorated to become a palace.

"Is this perhaps the shell left by that legendary cicada?" he speculated. The *Kunling Divine Record* stated: "Ancient cicada sheds, new cicada emerges, flapping wings to flee afar, another type of god, either perishes or is reborn."

Qin Ming gazed into the distance. Behind that grand palace, something had been severed by a sharp weapon; only half of the cicada exuviae remained, and with it, the decorated grand palace and this path were also cut off.

"Senior?" Qin Ming called out to the Sky Demon Mirror.

The broken mirror replied, "Oh, I almost forgot. We've reached the end. The path ahead is undetectable and has already shattered. There are no more fortunate arrangements." It informed him that he could now depart. Furthermore, it mentioned that it would ensure the geniuses from all paths would be dispersed and safely withdrawn.

"My situation is special. Please, Senior, lend a hand," Qin Ming requested. He had given Cao Qianqiu a beating, or more precisely, pummeled him to bits. He was worried that someone might be waiting for him outside.

"Understood!" the Sky Demon Mirror agreed.

Finally, people saw Demon One soar across the sky, carried by a golden fierce bird, flying out of the Secret Realm. He seemed to be traversing space and time, rapidly heading towards the depths of the plateau, disappearing in the blink of an eye. That, of course, was not his true body; it was merely a trick of the Sky Demon Mirror.

At this moment, Qin Ming's true body landed within the Secret Realm. He quickly reverted to his original appearance, changed back into his previous clothes, and once again became Shen Wubing. At the same time, he forced out three demonic seeds, refined them with a piece of tattered cloth, washing away every trace of demonic aura until nothing remained, then wrapped them up.

Outside, a fierce battle had already erupted. Pu Heng was fighting a colossal demon in a bloody struggle, engaging in a major conflict that shook the entire region. The region was stained with blood—demon blood, and also Pu Heng's blood. Both were injured.

On that day, in the Outsider's Pure Land, Cao Qianqiu emerged from seclusion, tearing apart the night sky with a bloody radiance! A Pure Yang Consciousness Spirit Light clone of Pu Heng personally rushed back to the Outsider's Pure Land to report to him.

"The Secret Realm no longer needs to exist. That plateau should also be cleansed with blood!" On that day, Cao Qianqiu set off. He traversed the Night Mist World, personally rushing towards Kunling. Everyone was shocked, for he was radiating killing intent. A crimson sun illuminated the mountains and rivers along his path, as if the age of daylight had arrived, only stained with blood!
