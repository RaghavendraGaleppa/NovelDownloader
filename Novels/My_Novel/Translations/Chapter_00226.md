# Chapter 226: The Madam Is at a Loss, the Four Heroes Attempt an Assassination

Originally...

Ma Zhongguang was a Gu master from the Southern Frontier, extremely skilled in using Gu. He rarely spoke, not because he was cold-natured, but because he raised Gu worms in his throat, rendering him unable to speak.

When he spoke, his throat could no longer produce sound. He had to use his Internal Qi to stimulate the Gu, making the worms beat their wings to produce sounds resembling human speech.

Back on the Dragon Ship, he had already secretly laid the groundwork for future tracking. After the Dragon Appreciation Banquet ended, Ma Zhongguang began to search for Wen Caishang's whereabouts.

Recently, Wen Caishang had been traveling swiftly along the road, making no effort to hide her trail. Ma Zhongguang found her quickly. During their earlier conversation, Wen Caishang had been on guard, so Ma Zhongguang truly had no opportunity to plant his Gu.

Who would have thought that Wen Caishang would strike first? She was ruthless and decisive, her methods unfathomable, exceeding his expectations. Caught off guard, his life was already extinguished.

But Ma Zhongguang was an old hand in the Jianghu and possessed his own ultimate techniques. He pieced together the recipe and comprehended the "Way of the Art: Curse," and he also carried the珍蛊 (rare Gu) - the Qi-Eating Gu.

In his moment of despair, he used his life to cast a curse, desperately planting the Gu. Although Wen Caishang had broad knowledge and was also cautious, how could one guard against the myriad paths of the world?

If she hadn't killed him and had instead driven Ma Zhongguang away, she wouldn't have been infected by the rare Gu. However, Ma Zhongguang's counterattack from the brink of death was also extremely formidable.

Wen Caishang's face suddenly turned pale, losing all her composure. She desperately tried to disperse the Gu worms. But how could this be easy? The harder she tried to drive them away, the tighter the Gu worms clung, drinking more and more of her Internal Qi.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, what is wrong?"

Wen Caishang suppressed the loss of her Internal Qi, forcibly maintaining her composure. She thought, "That old bastard used his life to trap me before he died; it's truly hateful beyond measure. If I hadn't feared Gu arts, how could I have let him die so easily! Right now, in my condition, once my Internal Qi is completely depleted, won't I be in a great passive position? Although Li Xian used to be loyal, people change. If he knew my Internal Qi was gone and was frightened by the enemy's strength, he might run away to save his own life. What would I do then?"

She couldn't help but become wary again, glancing at Li Xian imperceptibly.

She smiled and said, "That little old man's skills are lacking; what can he do to me? Little Xian, help me into the carriage."

Li Xian said, "Alright." He supported Wen Caishang as she stood up and slowly walked to the carriage. He felt that Wen Caishang's posture seemed less light and agile than usual. She had the feeling of a fairy descending to the ground.

After closing the carriage curtains, Li Xian prepared to get off. Wen Caishang frowned and asked, "Where are you going?!"

Li Xian said, "I'm going to deal with that corpse, and then fetch some water."

Wen Caishang realized her loss of composure and her expression softened slightly. "That old thing is covered in Gu. First, drive the carriage away. You can shoot an arrow to set him on fire from a distance."

Li Xian did as he was told. He shot an arrow from afar to burn the body, avoiding being affected by the Gu worms. The carriage traveled along the official road. Inside the compartment, Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes were cast downward. "This is the rare Qi-Eating Gu. It attaches to the Qi Lake and drinks a person's Internal Qi. Legend says it will drink a person's Internal Qi dry within seven days, then attach itself to the lake. As soon as the Internal Qi regenerates, it immediately drinks it!"

"That old bastard... I really let him die too easily!"

She worked tirelessly but to no avail. Wen Caishang's heart grew cold, her hair stood on end, and her face was deathly pale. In her frustration, she pulled open the carriage curtain and saw the mountain scenery on both sides flashing by, but she felt the spring breeze was cold...

Although she remained calm on the surface, there were gradually fluctuations in her eyes. She knew that something was interfering ominously; this journey was fraught with extreme danger. She could no longer be certain if she could return safely.

Her Jianghu experience and vision were vast, but she was encountering such a perilous situation for the first time.

On the other side.

In a city inn, in a superior room, there were about ten people.

The Sword Hunting Alliance. The three sects, Taixin Sect, Jianyu Tower, and Huangsha Gate, had gathered to discuss matters.

Xi Kairen of Jianyu Tower said, "Four Heroes of Taixin, I know you are heroes and good men, but you said some time ago that you had severely injured the demoness. We don't know if the demoness is actually severely injured, but she has become even more arrogant instead. How do you explain this?"

The Four Heroes of Taixin looked embarrassed. The Tiger among them gritted his teeth and said, "That demoness is just outwardly strong but inwardly weak."

The attending elder of Huangsha Gate, named Zhao Zhiyuan, had a narrow face and a pointed mouth, with thin eyebrows and small eyes. He smiled and said, "Whether she is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, or if someone is just boasting wildly, I'm afraid it's hard to say."

The Dog among them roared in anger, "What do you mean by that?!"

Zhao Zhiyuan said, "My apologies, I meant no other meaning. Miss, I hope you won't take offense."

The Dog among them struck out ferociously. Zhao Zhiyuan dodged by moving his body. The Dog's eyes turned bloodshot, and he was about to launch a fatal move. The Deer among them twitched his shoulder, and his empty sleeve flew out, wrapping around the Dog.

The Dog had his male vitality severed by Wen Caishang, so he hated it the most when others called him "Miss" or "Eunuch." Zhao Zhiyuan touched his reverse scale, causing him to fly into a great rage.

The Four Heroes of Taixin shared a common grievance due to their disabilities. They said, "Brother Zhao, if you look down on us, please say it directly. We can have a match, why the sarcastic tone that disgusts people?"

Zhao Zhiyuan smiled and said, "I just said it casually, I have no disrespect intended, why get angry?"

The four of them reluctantly let it go, casting a cold glance at Zhao Zhiyuan. Su Qiuwu of Jianyu Tower said, "Everyone, please don't get angry. The most urgent matter is to find a way to deal with that demoness."

Everyone fell silent. Zhao Zhiyuan said, "Although I hate to admit it, that demoness's schemes and martial arts are superior to all of us. How do we deal with her? If we don't have a good strategy, she will escape again this time."

Everyone felt secretly anxious.

Su Qiuwu said, "I actually have a brilliant plan." He looked at the Four Heroes of Taixin and said, "Four Heroes of Taixin, you are the dragons and phoenixes among men. You have cultivated the martial art of man-beast unity, which is extremely powerful. You were able to wound Wen Caishang once, so想必 you can wound her a second time."

The expressions of the Four Heroes of Taixin changed simultaneously. The Deer among them said, "That may be true, but this matter is truly not glorious. The four of us brothers joined forces and only just managed to wound her. Attacking one person with four people, even if we win, it damages the chivalrous spirit of men."

"That's not how you should say it," Zhao Zhiyuan said. "That demoness is ruthless in her methods. In a life-and-death struggle for revenge, who cares about numbers or Jianghu morality and glory?"

Su Qiuwu said, "I admit I am inferior. I admire you, I admire you."

The Tiger, Serpent, and Dog nodded slightly, feeling quite pleased. Su Qiuwu continued, "Since the four of you could wound her once, then wounding her a second time should be taken for granted."

The four heroes changed color. The Deer among them hurriedly said, "Brother Su overestimates us. Although we severely injured the demoness, we also suffered heavy injuries ourselves and have not yet recovered. Cough, cough..."

The four heroes pretended to cough. To make it look real, they even secretly used their Internal Qi to shake their bodies, coughing up blood.

Su Qiuwu sneered secretly, thinking: "The rumor that Wen Caishang was injured was spread by me. With her swordsmanship, the four of you disabled beasts想要 to wound her, it's simply wishful thinking. Very well, very well, since you are boasting wildly, I will take advantage of the situation and make you fight with your lives."

He said, "I see. Since the four of you are injured, you cannot continue to hunt down the demoness."

The Four Heroes of Taixin took the offered台阶 (way out) and said, "Naturally. If our injuries were fully recovered, the four of us would naturally make a move again and capture that villainess."

"The reputation of the Four Heroes is well-deserved; you are truly not just empty names!" Zhao Zhiyuan praised.

The four of them glared angrily. Hearing Zhao Zhiyuan's voice made them angry. Su Qiuwu said, "Since the four hero brothers have such a great sense of justice, then if I, Su, were to be stingy, it would be truly unreasonable!"

Xi Kairen of Jianyu Tower took out a treasure box, opened it gently, and a fragrance filled the air. Inside were four ginseng roots.

Su Qiuwu said, "My Jianyu Tower is in the business of forging swords and selling ginseng. I have four 'Human King Ginseng,' which are treasures for healing internal injuries."

"They are only considered common items, but their value is indescribable. Please take them, heal your internal injuries, and then severely injure that demoness again!"

"This..." The Four Heroes of Taixin were caught in a dilemma.

Zhao Zhiyuan smiled and said, "Could it be that what I said was true, that the four of you were just boasting wildly? If that's really the case, I can understand. After all, people in the Jianghu care most about face. And the more one lacks face, the more..."

The Four Heroes of Taixin were extremely angered. They all thought the same thing: "The four of us have disabilities. Not to mention in the Jianghu, even within our own sect, we are often talked about behind our backs and secretly mocked. If it's confirmed that we were boasting, wouldn't our reputation be ruined? At that time, who would remember that we are the Four Heroes of Taixin? Who would mention our past glory?"

"只怕 we would be known as the 'Four Beasts' for the rest of our lives. Rather than that, we might as well grit our teeth and accept. At that time, we can risk our lives and land a hit or a kick on Wen Caishang. Even if we die, it won't look too bad."

Thinking of this, the four heroes said, "Alright! We will accept this Human King Ginseng. Just watch how the four of us will capture that villainess!"

They put away the Human King Ginseng. Su Qiuwu said, "Rest assured, esteemed heroes, my Jianyu Tower will give its full support. We will definitely be there to help you on that day!"

Zhao Zhiyuan said, "My Huangsha Gate is the same."

"Good!" The Four Heroes of Taixin said, "Farewell!"

After everyone separated, Xi Kairen, Su Qiuwu, and Qian Jingpeng of Jianyu Tower looked at each other and burst out laughing.

Xi Kairen said, "Brother Su, this plan is brilliant. Let the Four Beasts of Taixin properly deal with Wen Caishang."

Qian Jingpeng said, "Wait until they fight with their lives, exhausted, and then we will step in to capture and kill!"

Su Qiuwu laughed and said, "Wrong, wrong. We won't go to help at all!"

Xi Kairen and Qian Jingpeng were puzzled. "Why? Wouldn't it be excellent to围杀 (ambush and kill) that villainess together?"

Su Qiuwu said, "Are the two of you stupid? Whether that villainess is injured or not, aren't you and I clear about it? She is so powerful, do we have the confidence to take her down if we all go together? What if we lose our lives?"

Xi Kairen said, "Then..."

Su Qiuwu gently stroked his beard and said, "First, let the Four Heroes of Taixin fight with their lives. Whether they die or are injured. We will slowly bide our time, while adding more personnel and mobilizing the sect's resources. The most crucial point is not to easily let other sects take advantage."

Xi Kairen and Qian Jingpeng felt this was very reasonable and no longer argued.

Zhao Zhiyuan of Huangsha Gate had a similar idea.

"Help? Go to hell. At that time, we'll find an excuse and arrive fashionably late. It's none of my Huangsha Gate's business whether they live or die. Besides, we already know Wen Caishang's trail, so we can slowly deal with her."

"Making my Huangsha Gate sweat and bleed, only for other sects to pick the fruit in the end, I won't do such a foolish thing. Besides, there are still some sects that haven't made a move yet!"

Although the five major sects of the Sword Hunting Alliance were determined to capture and kill Wen Caishang, they inevitably schemed against each other and haggled over every detail.

The Four Heroes of Taixin had been disabled for over a decade; their minds were sensitive and they valued their reputation extremely highly. Being bound by their reputation, they had no time for anything else. The Deer among them was relatively intelligent and vaguely sensed the trickery, but he was powerless.

He could only消化 (absorb) the medicinal ginseng and fight with his life.

On a mountain path.

Seeing a fork in the road ahead, one path led into the mountains, the other into a large city.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, which way do we take?"

Wen Caishang pondered for a long time, not responding for a long while. The decision at this moment was of great consequence.

"If we enter the city, we will definitely be surrounded and killed. My Internal Qi is dissipating, and it won't be long before it is depleted. Fighting with people will only speed up the consumption. If we hide in the mountains... we might avoid the pursuit for a while, but they will never give up..."
