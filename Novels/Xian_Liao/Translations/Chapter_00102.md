# Chapter 102: Flying Sword

Another year passed in the blink of an eye.

Zhou Qing sat cross-legged under the great mulberry tree, observing the Health Preserver interface:

Heartfire Thunder (Proficient).  
Qi (Qi Refinement Eighth Layer).  
Body (Body Refinement Third Tier).  
Spirit (Qi Refinement Ninth Layer, Divine Sense Covers Three Hundred Meters).

After his divine sense expanded to cover a hundred zhang (approximately 333 meters), Zhou Qing could make no further progress. This was the biggest bottleneck he had encountered since beginning spirit refinement.

This year's greatest achievement was deriving from the Demon-Seeding Life-Embryo Technique a method to further refine the yin energy of the great mulberry tree, thereby accelerating his progress in cultivating Heartfire Thunder.

Originally, the progress in Heartfire Thunder cultivation was not only slow but also fraught with the dangers of excessive fire energy. His instinctive absorption of the great mulberry tree's yin energy alone was insufficient to counteract the drawbacks of Heartfire Thunder practice.

Moreover, whenever he approached the great mulberry tree, Zhou Qing felt a sense of unity with it. The vibrant vitality of all living things deepened his comprehension of thunder techniques.

He realized that thunder techniques encompassed the Dao of creation and vitality, not just destruction and annihilation.

Additionally, the great mulberry tree also benefited from the nourishing fire energy of Heartfire Thunder during this process, growing faster.

Zhou Qing was like a spiritual farmer, constantly using his Heartfire Thunder to accelerate the growth of the great mulberry tree while receiving feedback that enhanced his own cultivation.

Furthermore, Zhou Qing observed the Health Preserver interface:

Natural Lifespan (202 years).

His natural lifespan had increased slightly, which indicated that the Demon-Seeding Life-Embryo Technique could, in a way, harness the longevity traits of wood-attribute demons to extend his own life. However, he didn't know the ultimate limit of this life extension.

This gradual assimilation also significantly enhanced Zhou Qing's physical recovery abilities.

Demon-Seeding, Life-Embryo?

"Essentially, these changes mean my physical potential has improved. There must be other mysteries here, but they're beyond my current cultivation level to discern," Zhou Qing concluded based on his observations.

However, the great mulberry tree had become even more dominant. Apart from Zhou Qing, anyone else who approached too closely would incur its hostility—something even Zhou Qing found difficult to restrain.

Zhou Qing had also tried using mulberry branches to awaken other ancient trees, but without exception, all attempts failed. So far, the only exception was the great pine tree of Taihe Mountain.

Next, Zhou Qing had Zhang Jingxiu attempt to refine the yin-sha energy of the great pine tree using the Demon-Seeding Life-Embryo Technique. The pine tree's yin energy contained sha energy, though it was much milder than that of ghost vines or demon claw vines.

After Zhang Jingxiu refined it, Zhou Qing used Heartfire Thunder to help him purge the sha energy, minimizing its effects.

"From now on, I'll only need to help you purge the sha energy once a year," Zhou Qing determined accurately. Absorbing one or two years' worth of sha energy wouldn't significantly affect Zhang Jingxiu and might even temper him, though the discomfort of sha energy invasion was undeniable.

However, Zhang Jingxiu had begun cultivating gang energy, which could combine with sha energy to form gang-sha, so it wasn't entirely detrimental. Still, some sha energy would inevitably take root in his body, making self-purification difficult. That was when Zhou Qing's assistance became necessary.

Subsequently, Fushan, Fusong, and Xiao Ruowang also shared in refining the pine tree's yin-sha energy, though they didn't need to do so daily. Zhang Jingxiu and Fushan could refine it about once a month, Fusong once every month and a half, and Xiao Ruowang at even longer intervals.

This was only a temporary measure. Zhou Qing planned to find other wood-attribute demons for them in the future.

At its core, the Demon-Seeding Life-Embryo Technique plundered certain innate traits of wood-attribute demons, much like how demons devoured living beings or parasitized beasts and cultivators. Of course, the technique could be applied shallowly or deeply—the deepest method involved complete fusion with the demon, though that risked losing oneself to the demon's consciousness.

After roughly grasping the initial applications of the Demon-Seeding Life-Embryo Technique, the five gathered again for another important matter.

"The forbidden depths of the Western Mountains have been scouted. There's a celestial wolf there—snow-white fur, dozens of zhang in size, like a small hill. I think we should eliminate this threat early, before it grows further and emerges to wreak havoc." This was the accurate information Zhou Qing's scouts had gathered after a year of exploration. Several scouts had even become the celestial wolf's meals.

This mortal realm had over ten areas like the Western Mountains where demons thrived. Zhou Qing planned to explore each one and, together with the other four Innate experts, clear them out. Once this generation of demons was eliminated, even if new ones emerged, it would take many years—giving this generation ample time to develop.

Moreover, eliminating demons would prevent another incident like the demon claw vines.

Zhang Jingxiu said, "While each generation has its own challenges, it's best if we can resolve these threats ourselves rather than leaving them for our descendants."

Fusong remarked leisurely, "Old Zhang, your thinking is flawed. Our generation will outlive several generations of descendants."

Zhou Qing coughed, nearly retorting, "I'm not targeting anyone, but I could outlive all of you."

"I wonder if we'll meet Patriarch Jingyang when we explore the unknown cultivation realms outside," Fushan mused. He greatly admired this predecessor from centuries ago. If Patriarch Jingyang had reached higher realms, it wouldn't be surprising if he were still alive.

"Who knows? After dealing with the demons, we'll explore Patriarch Jingyang's cave abode," Zhou Qing finalized the plan, estimating it would take five to ten years. By then, his strength would likely reach its limit.

The group felt both trepidation and hope about the outside cultivation realms. They knew the path ahead existed—demons and fiends would serve as resources to help them surpass the unattainable heights of the old eunuch and the Grassland Martial Sage. The ship of the new era would sail to distant horizons beyond their predecessors' imaginations.

Next, Zhou Qing had the four Innate experts help him practice with the flying sword until his sword control reached a proficient level.

"Let's set out."

Their target: the forbidden depths of the Western Mountains.

Slay the Celestial Wolf!

This was delicate work.

A desolate, ancient aura gradually emanated from the sword embryo as Zhou Qing's true qi was consumed. Formation patterns further permeated the ironwood sword embryo...

After an indeterminate time, an ironwood sword enveloped in a soft black-green glow hovered before Zhou Qing, a sense of spiritual connection arising naturally.

"Success."

With a thought, the Xun Wind Formation on the ironwood sword activated. The sword's speed was so fast that even his divine sense almost couldn't keep up.

"Is this a flying sword?" Zhou Qing marveled inwardly.

...

"Master, is this the flying sword?" Yuan Mingyue watched curiously as the ironwood sword circled Zhou Qing.

Zhou Qing smiled. "You see it and still ask? Your efforts contributed to its creation."

Yuan Mingyue grinned, eyeing the sword enviously. "Practice diligently, and I'll make you one someday."

"Thank you, Master."

Zhou Qing went to the herb garden, where the rooster, Maori, had grown bold enough to approach the great mulberry tree. On a whim, Zhou Qing directed the ironwood sword at Maori, who frantically dodged. Their playful sparring further honed Zhou Qing's sword control.

Within ten to a hundred zhang was the optimal range for the flying sword, but beyond fifty zhang, the strain on his divine sense and qi increased sharply.

"The main issue is the lack of proper sword techniques—my control is too crude."

Even so, at a moderate distance, Zhou Qing could effortlessly dispatch ordinary qi refiners. Even Zhang Jingxiu and the others would struggle to evade his flying sword. This was why Zhou Qing had engraved the Xun Wind Formation—to maximize speed for initial strikes before closing in for melee combat. Few would expect a sword cultivator's greatest strength to be close-quarters combat.

Observing the Health Preserver again:

Ironwood Sword (Low-Grade Magical Artifact).

Zhou Qing understood this was because the sword's deep spiritual bond classified it as a special technique under the Health Preserver's evaluation.

"Only low-grade?" Zhou Qing pondered. Despite its rank, its power was formidable. Since the sword was tempered by his own true fire and spirit, even mid-grade artifacts might not match its effectiveness in his hands. However, without proper sword techniques, he couldn't unleash its full potential.

After more playful practice, Zhou Qing grew increasingly delighted—no man could resist the allure of a flying sword.

"Riding the sword through the skies for a thousand li, departing at midnight and returning by dawn."

Zhou Qing envisioned beheading enemies from miles away with his flying sword. The sword was more than a weapon—it was a sentiment.

...

On the great river, Zhou Qing invited the four Innate experts to spar.

"I bet Qingzhi is showing off his flying sword," Fusong remarked.

Zhang Jingxiu rolled his eyes. "Obviously." But as a martial arts fanatic, he was eager to witness the legendary flying sword.

Xiao Ruowang watched enviously. How long until he could fly and wield a flying sword like Zhou Qing?

Fushan remained composed, indifferent to combat—he was just here to assist.

The five Innate experts treaded water as Zhou Qing declared, "Eldest Brother, Second Brother, Brother Zhang, Brother Xiao, come at me together."

Before he finished, Fusong struck first with a move that sent towering waves crashing toward Zhou Qing.

Zhou Qing laughed. "Second Brother, such tricks won't work on me."

The ironwood sword streaked through the spray, appearing behind Fusong to tap his shoulder. Fusong shuddered.

"Damn, kid." The speed had startled him.

Seeing this, the others grew wary, but Zhou Qing kited them along the river, his flying sword disrupting their formations effortlessly.

"I yield!" Fusong was the first to quit.

Onshore, Zhang Jingxiu summarized, "Against sword cultivators, close the distance quickly and avoid open terrain—complex environments are better."

"Exactly. Had you all gotten within five zhang, your speed and power would've overwhelmed my sword control."

"Outside, we must strike first against sword cultivators," Zhang Jingxiu added.

Having heard Zhou Qing's insights about the outside cultivation realms and knowing of local sword cultivator legends, they understood the dangers ahead. Even fellow humans might not be allies, given the temptations of demonic cultivation. Survivors out there were surely formidable.

"I wonder if we'll meet Patriarch Jingyang when we explore the unknown cultivation realms outside," Fushan mused again.

"Who knows? After dealing with the demons, we'll explore Patriarch Jingyang's cave abode," Zhou Qing repeated.

The group felt both trepidation and hope. The path ahead existed—demons and fiends would be their stepping stones to heights unreachable by the old eunuch or the Grassland Martial Sage. The new era's ship would sail beyond their predecessors' wildest dreams.
