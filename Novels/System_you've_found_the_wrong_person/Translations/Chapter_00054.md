# Chapter 54: The Ageless Witch Flees with Her Bucket

A howling gale blew fiercely from the northwest.

Wang Chongguang's hair fluttered wildly, his robes billowing in the wind as his eyes widened in shock.

This scene.

Was completely unexpected.

Dou Changsheng had been ranked on the Human List as "Peerless in Benevolence and Righteousness." Even if this weren't his own sister, but merely a passerby, one would still hesitate before acting.

Yet never could he have imagined that such ruthless words would come from Dou Changsheng's mouth.

Were the Martial Arts Tower staff just eating plain rice for their meals?

No—the Martial Arts Tower had also fallen into corruption, accepting bribes to label such a heartless, ungrateful villain as a benevolent gentleman.

Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times.

Wang Chongguang suddenly realized his miscalculation—he had been misled by the Martial Arts Tower.

Too reckless. He should have been more cautious, attempted negotiation first. At the very least, he should have launched a surprise attack to subdue Dou Changsheng first, rather than relying solely on the paper evaluation to threaten him by capturing his sister.

Of course, Wang Chongguang also knew that his misjudgment couldn't be entirely blamed on himself. Since the Martial Arts Tower began publishing the Heaven, Earth, and Human Rankings, they had successively released various lists like the Ten Great Generals, Ten Divine Weapons, and Ten Great Beauties. Each list carried public credibility. When uncertain about something, they would never make baseless claims, instead adding the word "allegedly."

Thus, he had instinctively chosen to believe them. Yet he never expected the Martial Arts Tower to be just another corrupt institution that worked for money. Previously, they hadn't agreed to praise him more simply because he hadn't offered enough or lacked sufficient influence. But now, with the appearance of the Nine-Heaven Cloud Crane, the Martial Arts Tower immediately complied—revealing their true nature.

Wang Chongguang tried to speak again but found himself unable to utter a word.

His vision rapidly ascended until he could see the top of Dou Changsheng's head. Bewildered, he had no idea what was happening.

Darkness swallowed his sight, and he lost consciousness completely.

A cold voice spoke: "How dull."

From Dou Changsheng's perspective, Dou Taizhen had merely extended her fair hand and lightly pushed Wang Chongguang's head. In an instant, his head soared high into the air, separated from his body.

She had plucked his head as effortlessly as picking a flower. Yet no blood spurted from the corpse—not a single drop. Wang Chongguang seemed less like a living person and more like a porcelain doll, shattered with the slightest touch.

A Divine Transformation Grandmaster had died without even realizing what happened, unaware of how he had met his end.

Dou Taizhen didn't spare a glance at the corpse. Instead, her beautiful eyes remained fixed on Dou Changsheng, filled with suspicion.

In her view, she had already lowered her presence enough to observe the conflict between Dou Changsheng and Wang Chongguang from the sidelines, expecting an entertaining show.

She wanted to see whether this Dou Changsheng would become her shortest-lived older brother.

Yet the outcome had been completely unexpected.

Wang Chongguang had charged straight at her, while Dou Changsheng became secondary.

This was highly irregular.

Moreover, recent premonitions of danger had been growing stronger in her heart.

She felt as though thunder was gathering in the heavens.

The impending heavenly tribulation, which should have still been some time away, now seemed to be approaching ahead of schedule.

She had no choice but to enter dormancy. Originally, she only needed to avoid the Waking of Insects (惊蛰) each year—already unlucky enough. But now, she even had to hide from the autumn thunder.

How much free time would she even have left in a year? This was truly miserable.

If this continued, the situation would only worsen. She had to prepare thoroughly to survive the next heavenly tribulation.

Not only would this strengthen her power, but it would also grant her a period of peace, free from worrying about the tribulation.

A complex light flickered in Dou Taizhen's eyes.

An ominous premonition told her that all of this was happening because of the man before her—Dou Changsheng. But how could a mere Xiantian martial artist, not even at the Divine Transformation stage, possibly affect her to such an extent?

Logically, she should be the one influencing him.

Reason told her that her premonition was false.

It must be another Heavenly Realm expert scheming against her, distorting her foresight to make her believe Dou Changsheng was the cause.

Dou Taizhen had no desire to linger. All her interest had vanished the moment Wang Chongguang proved to be such a disappointment.

But before entering dormancy, she had to settle everything. Someone was plotting against her, and she had to uncover them—otherwise, disaster would surely follow. As for Dou Changsheng's affairs, she could no longer afford to care.

Her first suspect, naturally, was Scholar Jin.

For those below the Heavenly Realm interfering in Northern Jin's affairs, Scholar Jin wouldn't bother intervening. But if a Heavenly Realm expert got involved, that would strike at the core of Scholar Jin's principles. He had once sworn to the founding emperor of Great Jin: "As long as I live, Jin shall not perish."

Yet, by all logic, the Liu clan had also entered Great Jin as outsiders, not descendants of the founding emperor. There was precedent, which was why she had proactively negotiated with Scholar Jin—and he had agreed. Given Scholar Jin's character, he wasn't one to go back on his word.

As for Sage Lu, he had always kept to himself, guarding his own territory. As long as no one touched his Jixia Academy, he wouldn't interfere in anything.

One Heavenly Realm expert after another flashed through Dou Taizhen's mind.

Whoever had ensnared her, forcing her to evade the autumn thunder, had to be one of her peers. Counting carefully, there were only a few possibilities.

But none of them had any reason to do so.

In recent years, as her next heavenly tribulation approached, who would dare provoke her?

Wouldn't they fear that, knowing she might not survive the tribulation and was nearing her end, she would throw caution to the wind and fight them to the death—leaving them too injured to survive their own next tribulation?

Unable to make sense of it, Dou Taizhen couldn't understand why the situation had worsened so drastically.

Brushing a strand of hair behind her ear, she spoke in a cool voice: "Be careful."

"Something isn't right lately."

"Our fates are intertwined. I've only sensed the brewing of the heavenly tribulation, feeling restless with foreboding."

"But many dangers that are but a breeze to me could be a tempest to you—enough to shatter you to pieces."

"Take care."

With that, Dou Taizhen dissolved into countless motes of light, scattering into the world before vanishing completely.

Dou Changsheng stared at Wang Chongguang's corpse, greatly satisfied. What a wonderful sister—if only she hadn't left so quickly. As her older brother, he would have liked to take better care of her.

With a sister to share the burden of their family's troubles, life would be much easier for him.

In the future, the Dou family would grow ever more formidable, blessed by fate and invincibly fortunate.

But he feared that this fortune might instead consume him.

He truly couldn't withstand it.

After all, the misfortune grew stronger by the day, and even Dou Changsheng was afraid.

If even a Heavenly Realm expert found it troublesome, one could imagine how difficult it was for him to survive. If not for his overpowered cheat abilities, grass would already be growing on his grave.

If he had more sisters like this, he might as well ascend to heaven immediately.

He wondered how difficult this secret technique was to learn. He wouldn't mind adopting a few more older brothers or sisters.

She had left too quickly—he hadn't reacted in time to ask.

The first second after his sister's departure.

He missed her terribly.
