# Chapter 5: Chemistry  

Li Shiming's consciousness returned to the computer room, and this time, his focus was on the generator.  

The generator's crank handle had long become redundant. Under his conscious control, he removed the crank handle and two sets of gears from the generator.  

With the crank handle and the two sets of gears, constructing a manual centrifuge wasn’t particularly difficult.  

Especially after he brought wooden boards and tools into the computer room—operating with his consciousness, the remaining necessary parts were easily crafted.  

Thus, the world's first centrifuge was born. As he looked at the device before him, a thought struck him: *If I can manipulate everything directly with my consciousness in the computer room, why did I even bother making this centrifuge?*  

In an instant, the joy of creating this world-first invention vanished. He began reflecting on his thought process.  

An hour later, various materials and case files were delivered. During this time, Siqin had also returned with a small box containing about fifty rosary peas.  

Li Shiming took a stove and a clay pot, declining Siqin’s help, and began brewing the medicine according to Chief Escort Wang’s prescription.  

Unbeknownst to anyone, inside his computer room, multiple materials were already being processed.  

For safety, he partitioned a separate space in a corner of the computer room with wooden planks to prevent chemical substances from affecting the equipment.  

In reality, manually processing these raw materials into specified chemicals through chemical means would have been quite challenging.  

But within the computer room, where he had complete control, the task became extraordinarily simple.  

Here, he could perceive matter at the micrometer level and detect any internal changes, making chemical experiments effortless.  

No experimental apparatus was needed—his consciousness itself could serve as the container.  

Phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, ammonium sulfate, glycerin, abrin, and nitroglycerin—all were successfully prepared. The fifty-plus rosary peas, once shelled, yielded a small amount of liquid abrin.  

Who would have thought that this tiny amount of liquid could be lethal to multiple people, ranking among the deadliest substances in this world?  

This was no naturally occurring poison but one refined through scientific means—something that, by all rights, shouldn’t exist in this world.  

As for nitroglycerin, several kilograms were prepared and stored in sealed jars within the computer room’s warehouse.  

After completing all this, Li Shiming realized the medicine still hadn’t finished brewing—proof of just how smoothly things went when operating with his consciousness in the computer room.  

He began formulating his plans, knowing better than to underestimate Chief Escort Wang.  

---  

During the chemical preparation process, Li Shiming realized that without a proper furnace, he couldn’t achieve ultra-high temperatures using wood as fuel in the computer room.  

Though ultra-high temperatures were rarely needed in chemical experiments, his thoughts extended further.  

To address this, he sketched several parts and listed some materials on paper, then handed them to his servant, Moyan, to procure.  

Moyan, who had earned quite a few rewards for his efficiency, confidently assured him that the items would be delivered soon.  

Neither Siqin nor Moyan questioned Li Shiming’s sudden interest in purchasing these odd items or his medicine-brewing activities.  

While other young masters indulged in entertainment, their own master was merely expanding his knowledge with harmless purchases—hardly worth remarking upon, let worth criticizing.  

Li Shiming picked up the case files Moyan had brought. Outsiders might not have access to such documents, but as the prefect’s son, his requests were rarely refused within the Nanling Prefecture’s government offices.  

The case files were meticulously detailed, describing the incident from multiple perspectives.  

They included testimonies from the brothel’s madam, courtesans, attendants, and guests, as well as on-site investigation conclusions—evidently, the records were highly professional.  

Tianxiang Tower was a well-known brothel in Nanling Prefecture. That day, the third floor had been reserved by the Weiyuan Escort Agency for Chief Escort Wang and seven other escorts to gather.  

A man in white suddenly appeared and killed all seven escorts.  

According to guests on the second floor, multiple floorboards on the third floor were shattered by terrifying force. Chief Escort Wang fell through the broken floor and then fled through a window.  

The man in white, his legs emitting a green glow, pursued him immediately.  

None of the witnesses on the second floor could describe the white-clad man’s face—it was as though a layer of mist obscured his features.  

Moreover, the man exuded an aura so chilling that several people who saw him lost control of their bladders on the spot.  

The case file’s concluding remarks speculated that the man in white was an immortal cultivator.  

Upon reading about immortal cultivators, Li Shiming felt as though he had crossed worlds again—this world actually had immortal cultivators? He had found no trace of this in his predecessor’s memories.  

This wasn’t the predecessor’s fault. The original Li Shiming had been a fifteen-year-old scholar, wholly devoted to the Four Books and Five Classics.  

He had few friends, partly due to his studious nature and limited social interactions, and partly because of his age.  

Normally, scholars from the same city would frequently gather to discuss literature, debate philosophy, or indulge in romantic pursuits.  

But how could a fifteen-year-old Li Shiming integrate into a circle of adult scholars?  

Among these scholars, even those in their twenties were rare, let alone ones his age.  

This didn’t mean Nanling Prefecture lacked young scholars—it was just that prodigies like him appeared only once every decade or so. The previous young scholars had long since grown into their twenties.  

The original Li Shiming had no interest in befriending those who sought connections with the powerful. As a result, his social circle remained small.  

With few friends and a singular focus on studying, his predecessor’s knowledge was narrow, mostly limited to scholarly pursuits.  

Of course, Li Shiming was somewhat grateful for this. At least it meant he wouldn’t have to constantly worry about slipping up in social interactions.  

*No wonder Chief Escort Wang sought refuge in the prefect’s office—he’s being hunted by an immortal cultivator!* Li Shiming mused.  

The fact that an immortal cultivator was after Chief Escort Wang suggested he possessed something coveted by such beings. This piqued Li Shiming’s interest.  

If this world were merely an ordinary one, he could leverage the computer room to carve out a place for himself.  

But if it was a world of immortal cultivation, his plans would need to change.  

Longevity, transcendence, and freedom to roam the heavens and earth—these were the desires of all living beings. Even the slightest chance was worth pursuing.  

Once the medicine was ready, Li Shiming had Siqin fetch a food box and placed the brewed concoction inside a large bowl within it.  

"Siqin, don’t follow me. I’m going for a walk in the garden," Li Shiming instructed as he lifted the food box.  

Under Siqin’s puzzled gaze, he left the courtyard.
