Chapter 147: Subduing Demons

Above the majestic mountain, dark clouds gathered thickly, rain poured down, and crimson lightning occasionally streaked across.

In the curtain of rain, Qin Ming was enveloped in green light, untouched by the raindrops. The essence of plants and trees combined with his Sky Radiance Qi, forming a colossal palm print that illuminated the night sky, as if a giant divine being was striking to subdue demons and monsters here.

With a single palm strike, the green light flared, evaporating the torrential rain, and accompanied by a deafening roar that actually drowned out the thunder.

The Fire Qilin Lion, with its ferocious flames billowing, brought a claw down as if wielding the might of heaven and earth's thunder and rain, crimson light engulfing the area.

The colossal green palm collided with the crimson beast claw, like the God of Thunder meeting the Goddess of Lightning. Green and crimson light radiated in all directions, sweeping across the mountain peak.

In the rainy night, on the dark mountain, this fierce clash erupted with terrifyingly dazzling light, as if piercing through the night sky.

A human youth, with hair fluttering, ethereal and transcendent, blocked a colossal, fiery-red glowing beast with his pure white palm!

On the mountain, a group of Blood Lions stared wide-eyed in disbelief. That was their king, with such massive beast claws, erupting with unparalleled crimson glow and fire, yet it couldn't suppress a slender youth?

The upright Old Donkey, who had rolled up its sleeves, lowered them again, hesitant to step forward and help.

In just one day, this youth had undergone a complete transformation and was now capable of directly clashing with the 'Second Boss'!

"Roar!" The Fire Qilin Lion let out a bellow that shook the colossal mountain, its sound piercing through the rain curtain and echoing over the great plain.

In the nearby areas, many demons showed expressions of shock. Some bird demons flew into the night sky, all greatly shaken.

"Even the Lion King can't suppress that human youth?!"

The Fire Qilin Lion, with a body comparable to a giant elephant, glowed crimson, as if molten iron covered its entire form. It constantly swung its massive claws, wreathed in fierce flames.

Qin Ming's hair fluttered, his entire body enveloped in E-wood essence. He was directly confronting the old lion, striking out palm after palm, utterly fearless.

They moved at extreme speed on the mountain peak, like two entwined bolts of lightning.

The giant lion spat flames, its entire body's crimson scales glowing, exuding unparalleled oppressive power in the dark, rainy night.

However, Qin Ming blocked all its attacks, displaying a transcendent and otherworldly demeanor.

Moreover, his strength grew progressively greater. Resonating with the plants and trees of the entire mountain, green light illuminated everything. Sparks flew from the great lion's claws as he struck them with his fists and palms, and to their astonishment, streaks of blood had begun to seep out!

It roared, its twin claws glowing, generating special energy fluctuations that transformed into a pair of large broadswords. These were weapons condensed from a mixture of Sky Radiance Qi and demonic energy, and they shattered the E-wood essence in front of Qin Ming.

The Fire Qilin Lion's forehead bone was crystalline, accumulating a considerable amount of conscious spiritual light.

It was guarding against that pristine white small sword. After suffering a major loss once, its conscious spiritual light was exceptionally active, refusing to allow itself to be ambushed again.

With a clang, a sword hum resonated. The essence of plants and trees, gathered from all directions, condensed in Qin Ming's palm into a glistening green longsword.

It was crystalline and translucent, shining like a green sun.

Qin Ming resonated with the plants and trees, holding the E-wood Sword and slashing forward.

Amidst clanging sounds, the Fire Qilin Lion's two broadswords were severed, dissipating into demonic energy and Sky Radiance Qi.

The Fire Qilin Lion was struck by the E-wood Sword, a large section of its scales exploded, leaving it a bloody mess with a huge gash. Its injuries were not light.

Its entire body was engulfed in fierce flames. It clawed forward, clamping down on the glistening green E-wood Sword, trying to twist it apart. However, three of its sharp claws were severed, and the flesh at the base of its claws was torn open, blood flowing.

The Fire Qilin Lion released the sword and quickly retreated.

Last time, Qin Ming was completely suppressed by it, finding it difficult to even break through its protective Sky Radiance Qi. His strongest attack only managed to shatter a few of its scales.

After Qin Ming's seventh rebirth, everything was different.

He swung the E-wood Sword, carrying the essence of all the mountain's plants and trees, and slashed downwards.

The Fire Qilin Lion had nowhere to dodge. Crimson light surged from its body, and demonic energy and Sky Radiance Qi simultaneously boiled, as it braced itself to withstand this attack head-on.

With a boom, the E-wood Sword dimmed and then disintegrated.

The Fire Qilin Lion was in a truly miserable state. It was sent flying, half of its body covered in blood, a large section of its scales burst open, leaving it a bloody mess with wounds deep enough to expose bone.

It had transformed into a Blood Lion!

The Black Roc, surprisingly, did not enter the fray, coldly observing the battle, intending to gauge the human youth's true strength through the Fire Qilin Lion.

The Fire Qilin Lion's face was ashen, its fiery glow seemingly about to be extinguished. The human youth it had almost beaten to death just a day ago was now beating *it*!

The youth was approaching, wreathed in green mist, calm and composed, with a peaceful expression, like an exiled immortal. This demeanor made the lion increasingly uncomfortable.

The Fire Qilin Lion remained silent, taking out a helmet forged from mystic metal and placing it on its massive head. It believed that its earlier poor performance was due to distraction, needing to guard against the pristine white small sword. Now, it would protect its vital points!

Qin Ming smiled, having caught a faint fragrance, confirming that the heavily wounded Fire Qilin Lion possessed 'Wondrous Blood' within its body!

This filled him with immense anticipation; he should be able to refine 'Wondrous Medicine' from it, strengthening his foundation and further breaking through limits to enhance his power.

The Fire Qilin Lion saw him smile, mistook it as mockery for wearing a helmet, and charged forward in a fit of rage.

Qin Ming stretched his body, feeling relaxed and natural. He spread his five fingers, executing the Dragon Claw Hand, a technique he had obtained from Mount Luofu Immortal.

Of course, all of this was predicated on the qualitative change in his Sky Radiance Qi, which now allowed him to tear open the Fire Qilin Lion's protective light.

Qin Ming clashed directly with it, tearing apart its crimson scales multiple times.

He then unleashed the Metal-Severing Finger, severing several of the great lion's sharp claws, leaving its forelimbs bloody.

The Fire Qilin Lion lowered its head, finding its claws gone, now bare. Then it was sent flying horizontally, struck by the youth's E-wood Palm, its scales bursting open and blood staining its entire body.

Clang!

Its helmet dented inward, after enduring three consecutive palm strikes, cracks appeared on its skull.

In an instant, the Fire Qilin Lion suffered repeated heavy blows. Four of its ribs were broken, a fist-sized hole appeared in its abdomen, and it coughed up large mouthfuls of blood.

"Get out of the way!" the Black Roc King roared. Both it and the Fire Qilin Lion were enormous creatures and couldn't fight in such close quarters.

It hung in the air like a black scorching sun, then swiftly descended like a bolt of lightning.

Qin Ming drew his blade, not daring to underestimate this Black Roc, knowing it was exceptionally formidable.

With a clang, this time he shattered the dark light surrounding its body—a mixture of malevolent aura, Sky Radiance Qi, and demonic energy, which ordinary outer-saints couldn't penetrate.

Qin Ming evaded its sharp claws, his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade slashing towards its wing, already touching its feathers!

The Black Roc charged past, leaving a dozen black feathers fluttering down.

It hovered mid-air, its wings moving like human arms, then clasped together as if performing a special hand seal, suddenly slashing downwards, unleashing streaks of dark light.

Qin Ming blocked with his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade, producing a crisp metallic hum.

He looked at the dark clouds pressing down on the mountaintop and the increasingly dense lightning, feeling a sudden inspiration, wanting to attempt a terrifying secret technique.

Originally, Qin Ming had wanted to experiment with it in the Sky Radiance Pit of Mount Luofu Immortal, but he had given up in the end.

Now, his strength was sufficient, and he had a certain degree of confidence.

The Jade Iron Blade in Qin Ming's hand glowed, and wind force erupted, as if stirring up scattered clouds, even changing the trajectory of the pouring rain.

He probed further, using Overlord's Qi as his core, then employing Wind-Thunder Qi to try and capture the lightning striking near the mountain.

Immediately, he circulated the Wu Ji Sutra, and earth essence steamed from beneath his feet, protecting his entire body.

Next, Qin Ming circulated the E-wood Sutra, resonating with the plants and trees of the entire mountain. Green mist surged, engulfing him.

Holding nothing back, he pointed his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade towards the sky, vibrating his Wind-Thunder Qi to draw in the nearby lightning.

With a thunderous boom, lightning interwoven on the mountain peak, creating an exceptionally terrifying sight.

He had indeed drawn lightning with his Wind-Thunder Qi.

The Black Roc, in the midst of spreading its wings, let out a miserable shriek, struck by the lingering electric arcs, its feathers standing on end.

Qin Ming boldly tried again. This time, after using Overlord's Qi and Wind-Thunder Qi, he drew in a flash of lightning that wasn't very bright.

Startling thunder boomed between heaven and earth, and the entire mountaintop trembled.

Qin Ming let out a muffled groan, falling backward onto the ground. Even though he possessed Wind-Thunder Qi and protected himself with earth essence and E-wood essence, he was still hit. Controlling wind and thunder was far from as easy as he had imagined.

Fortunately, he was only grazed, and besides a brief numbness, he sustained no fatal injuries.

Theoretically, mastering Wind-Thunder Qi allowed one to control lightning, including the lightning in a rainy night. However, his cultivation realm was still low, making it impossible to smoothly manipulate natural lightning.

He dared to cast this spell because he had studied the Overlord's Legacy Scroll for a long time and grasped some of its essence.

The Overlord's rise to prominence after reaching the Spiritual Field realm was primarily due to him using his unique Overlord's Qi as a core, combining it with wind force, etc., and through his distinct spiritual field, borrowing the power of the grand momentum of heaven and earth to crush his opponents with overwhelming force.

Qin Ming, possessing Overlord's Qi and insights into Wind-Thunder Qi, found it barely feasible to attempt to draw lightning in this special weather, by using the Wu Ji Sutra and E-wood Sutra to alter the mountain environment and construct a 'false spiritual field' for self-protection.

The Black Roc roared, shrieking as it plummeted.

Qin Ming was merely grazed by the lightning, but the Roc was far more severely injured. One of its wings was pierced through, leaving a horrifying bloody hole.

Had it been any other creature, it would have surely turned to ash, dead beyond dead.

The Black Roc was stronger than the Fire Qilin Lion, having lived long enough to attain an exceptionally profound cultivation. Yet, it hadn't expected to be severely wounded by the human youth's lightning conjuration the moment it joined the fight.

It landed on the ground, one wing bare, its feathers falling off with the wind, revealing searing red flesh.

The Old Donkey was dumbfounded. Was this still its omnipotent big brother? In a single encounter, it had been struck bald!

The bird demons all over the mountain were shocked and terrified. Was even the Great King no match?

The Black Roc stood in the pouring rain, allowing the water to lash against its body.

Its left wing was glossy black, while its right side was utterly featherless, becoming a yin-yang body.

It was enraged beyond measure; this grotesque appearance was too shameful to be seen!

Qin Ming lay for a while before getting up, because the enraged Black Roc was already charging along the ground!

He felt relieved now; this great bird couldn't escape, as it couldn't fly into the sky anymore.

"Baldy, let's see where you run this time!" Qin Ming declared.

The Black Roc froze for a moment upon hearing these words, glanced at its body, then let out an angry, long cry that shook the night sky, causing the torrential rain to seemingly flow backward into the heavens.

Undoubtedly, Qin Ming's words were extremely damaging and insulting, making the Great Roc King feel as if it had been struck by lightning again.

The Black Roc stomped its twin claws on the ground, immediately performing the 'Great Roc Spreads Single Wing' technique, sweeping its intact black wing towards the youth.

Qin Ming gripped his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade and clashed directly with it. After the qualitative change in his Sky Radiance Qi, he could now break through the opponent's protective light.

With a clang, he brought his blade down, severing many tail feathers!

The Black Roc opened its mouth and spat out a beam of dark light, its radiating energy terrifyingly potent, seemingly twisting space itself.

Qin Ming shifted his body horizontally, as the dark light blasted a magnificent building into smithereens.

The Black Roc's 'footwork' was astonishing; even on the ground, it remained incredibly swift, moving like a black bolt of lightning. Its wings were like broadswords, each downward sweep shaking the mountain and causing the ground to collapse.

Around Qin Ming's body, lightning crackled and wind force surged. He released the Jade Iron Blade in his hand, using Wind-Thunder Qi to control it, making it spin and slash around him.

"Blade Control Art!" The Old Donkey was shocked. It was friends with the Weasel and knew that Huang Yuan, a master of blade arts, had been researching how to control blades to slash opponents from afar, but had made no progress.

Now, this human youth had actually cultivated Wind-Thunder Qi to this extent, capable of controlling his blade! Although it could only spin close to his body and not travel far, it was enough to show that his understanding of the Wind-Thunder Blade Manual far surpassed Huang Yuan's.

Qin Ming was indeed controlling his blade, using the Sky Radiance Qi outside his body to constantly hack and slash at his opponent.

Amidst the blade gleam, Roc blood splattered, and large swathes of feathers fell. Especially the Black Roc's bare flesh wing was scarred and wounded, deep enough to show bone.

The Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade didn't stray far from Qin Ming, remaining within a foot's radius, but it was incredibly agile, flitting up and down, carrying Wind-Thunder Qi, and continuously hacking at the Black Roc.

Finally, he couldn't resist drawing lightning again.

In the night sky, a bolt of lightning descended, striking the Black Roc's body, creating a bloody hole in its back, and causing the remaining half of its feathers to fall off.

It shrieked miserably, staggering backward, heavily wounded by the Wind-Thunder Blade!

Qin Ming also took the opportunity to lie down, simulating the lightning with his own Wind-Thunder Qi, as if he had been struck simultaneously.

He had already sensed that powerful demons had arrived in the shadows!

Indeed, the Black Roc shouted: "Three elder brothers, when will you make your move?!"

Three figures appeared in the darkness: a large silver hedgehog, a strange bird somewhat resembling a phoenix, and a human man!

The Black Roc and Fire Qilin Lion knew very well that Qin Ming's strength would certainly increase after obtaining and refining the silver heart, and since they couldn't find him for a while, they invited helpers and patiently waited for him to come to them, to ambush him here.

The Black Roc spoke: "Three elder brothers, he truly has a small sword forged from exotic metal on him, worth a fortune. Furthermore, after you kill him, I will not break my promise and will offer you a portion of Wondrous Blood!"

Qin Ming stood up, his fighting spirit high. Today, he might obtain three portions of Wondrous Medicine!
