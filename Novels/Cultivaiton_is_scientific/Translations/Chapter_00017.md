# Chapter 17: Electric Arc  

Li Shiming held two black silicon carbide rods in his hands. It had taken him a full five days to produce these two rods.  

Given the limited conditions, he had resorted to a rather primitive method—burial sintering. From his servant Moyan, he had learned about a nearby mountain where black stones—coal—could be found. Since burning coal produced toxic gases, few in this world used it as fuel.  

He had used five large cartloads of coal to successfully fire the two silicon carbide rods.  

Only because his consciousness could participate within the computer room space, isolating heat and harmful substances, did he dare to carry out such an operation there. Otherwise, it would have been too dangerous.  

Given the current technological level of this world, even if he revealed the method for making silicon carbide rods, no one else would be able to replicate it. His success was only possible because his consciousness could monitor the material changes in real time within the computer room space.  

His consciousness manipulated several custom-made parts delivered by his servant Moyan, combining them with heat-resistant materials he had processed himself to form a peculiar device.  

Even a professional from his past life wouldn’t have been able to discern the purpose of this contraption.  

Even after installing the two silicon carbide rods, the device couldn’t function as intended.  

This was an electric arc furnace missing its most crucial components—the high-voltage transformer and electrical control system.  

Li Shiming wasn’t lacking in knowledge about making high-voltage transformers, capacitors, resistors, or other electronic components. The real issue was the absence of too many foundational materials, leaving him with no way to proceed.  

His solution was simple. The uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in the computer room could be adjusted to output the high-voltage electricity required by the arc furnace. As for the electrical control issues, the UPS could handle those as well.  

The primary reason for building an arc furnace was self-defense. With it, he could smelt iron himself. Using his consciousness within the computer room, he could shape steel into any form with precision.  

Additionally, depending on the input voltage, the arc furnace could generate temperatures between 1,300 to nearly 2,000 degrees Celsius—enough to easily process and create most foundational materials.  

Only with these foundational materials could many of the technological products from his past life be recreated in this world.  

Of course, processing these materials wasn’t urgent. Before creating tools for self-defense, he needed to produce one critical item first.  

Over the past few days, he had reduced electricity consumption, using his consciousness to manually operate the generator and recharge the UPS. By today, the UPS was fully charged.  

The accumulated electricity was reserved for the arc furnace.  

---  

His consciousness retrieved the finalized blueprint, which had undergone several revisions.  

It was a steam engine. The blueprint not only contained the design of the steam engine itself but also detailed alloy compositions for each required metal component.  

His consciousness used copper wires to channel high-voltage electricity from the UPS into the two silicon carbide rods. A blindingly bright arc of extreme heat formed between them.  

Pre-prepared iron and other metals were fed into the arc furnace in sequence under his conscious control, melting into alloyed molten metal.  

The intense heat of the arc furnace had no effect on his consciousness. He monitored the molten alloy until it reached the desired composition, then disconnected the arc furnace from the UPS.  

His consciousness lifted the molten alloy out of the furnace, shaping it midair into the required part.  

Within the computer room space, his consciousness was nearly equivalent to multiple high-precision machines.  

It was only because of the unique properties of the computer room space that he could realize his designs so effortlessly.  

After cooling, the first part was taken out of the computer room space.  

Holding the part in his hand, its distinctly modern metallic texture nearly brought tears to his eyes.  

He had made many things before, but none carried the essence of his past life. This part was the first true manifestation of his former world’s technology here.  

Even this single part was beyond the capability of ordinary craftsmen.  

Setting aside the perfected alloy formula, even the micron-level precision was something no ordinary artisan could achieve.  

Without machine tools, only the so-called "master craftsmen" might have the skill to produce such a part by hand.  

Li Shiming had never seen the abilities of a master craftsman. Even with his family’s status, he couldn’t command the services of one.  

He checked the electricity consumption. The high-voltage conversion had used a manageable amount of power, so he continued operating the arc furnace without pause.  

One alloy part after another was produced. By the time the last one was completed, ten days had passed—just three days remained before the imperial examinations.  

The lengthy duration was mainly due to the time spent replenishing electricity. The arc furnace consumed power far too quickly.  

The furnace was also too small, forcing him to manufacture larger components like the flywheel and boiler in segments before welding them together with the arc welder.  

Only because his consciousness could perceive the internal state of the parts within the computer room space did this segmented approach not introduce critical flaws.  

Fortunately, none of these challenges hindered the manufacturing process. Soon, a steam engine stood completed within the computer room space.  

After adding water and coal to the steam engine and igniting the fuel, the flywheel began to turn slowly as the water heated up. As the temperature rose, the flywheel spun faster and faster.  

---  

The flywheel drove the generator’s rotor, producing electricity as it turned.  

The electricity flowed into the UPS, replenishing its reserves.  

As long as there was water and coal, the generator would continue producing power.  

Of course, the generator had also been modified. With the arc furnace, his consciousness had crafted micron-level bearings to replace the original leather lubrication system, significantly improving the generator’s efficiency.  

The electricity generated could now not only power the arc furnace but also allow the large-scale server, IBM z15, to operate at full capacity without entering power-saving mode.  

Li Shiming no longer needed to exhaust his own mental energy. He only had to periodically replenish coal and water and occasionally purge impurities and gases confined within the computer room space.  

He hadn’t neglected his cultivation during these days either. The first layer of the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique" had reached its peak, and he would soon attempt to break through to the second layer.  

He wasn’t sure how his cultivation speed compared to others, but the spiritual energy within his body had grown significantly denser—enough that he could now barely attempt learning low-level spells.  

After the imperial examinations, once he reached the second layer of Qi Refining, he planned to begin studying the three spells available to him—not that he had much choice in the matter.  

Li Shiming’s consciousness connected with the IBM z15 mainframe. All 190 CPUs, 40TB of RAM, and the disk array cabinet were fully engaged.  

As the mainframe reached full operational capacity, a wave of dizziness washed over him.  

It was the result of his brain struggling to keep up with the massive data flow.  

He chuckled wryly. Who would have thought that he, not the computer, would be the bottleneck?  

Adjusting the connection, he created a data buffer in the RAM to mediate the exchange between his mind and the mainframe, finally resolving the issue.
