# Chapter 208: Nineteenth on the Hidden Dragon List, What Kind of Title Is This!

“Yin Mianmian sent you to give me a warning?”

“Yes, the bounty I accepted was issued by the Holy Maiden.”

“Not to kill me, just to warn me?”

“That’s right.”

Under Shang Wu’s gaze, Xu Yiliu confessed very straightforwardly.

He had no doubt that if he showed the slightest hesitation, the woman as beautiful as a flower would blast him into pieces with a single punch.

“Even the Holy Maiden needs to place an order to get people moving. How profit-driven...”

Li Mo was puzzled:

“What does she want to warn me about?”

Qian Bufan said gravely:

“Once you enter the Drizzle Pavilion, you can never leave for life, unless you die.”

“Is she telling me... that if I betray the Drizzle Pavilion, they can find me at any time?”

Li Mo understood Yin Mianmian’s meaning, his expression turning strange.

He had obtained the *Hall Before the Swallow* purely by chance and had never considered himself a member of the Drizzle Pavilion.

The Huaishan Three Tyrants weren’t just him alone.

Why did they come looking for him...

“It seems our preparations in advance were correct.”

Xue Jing originally thought it was enough for him and Qian Bufan to come and didn't want Shang Wu to follow.

“Huh? Someone trying to snatch my disciple?”

Shang Wu’s almond eyes widened, and she sneered, “Yin Mianmian, right? Don’t let me catch her. If I do, I’ll beat her into a soft lump!”

“The Drizzle Pavilion has an Outer Scene expert this time,” Li Mo reminded her.

Shang Wu thought for a moment, still saying, “So what if it’s an Outer Scene? I’ll beat them anyway!”

“There’s also a Dharma Body.”

“Then lure him into the sect... I’ll give it a try.”

Shang Wu’s tone lowered significantly as she let out a soft snort.

Li Mo was stunned. He thought his beautiful master would beat around the bush and laugh it off, after all, her principle was never to fight opponents she had no chance of winning against.

He didn’t expect that in the Qingyuan Sect, his master could actually put up a fight against a Dharma Body?

The few of them looked grave, discussing whether they should immediately have the Sect Master come over.

Li Mo’s peripheral vision swept over Xu Yiliu.

“By the way, where is the Black Pavilion in Yunzhou that issues bounties for the Drizzle Pavilion?”

“This... I cannot say.”

This time, even Shang Wu’s death glare didn’t work.

Xu Yiliu’s face turned pale, and he shook his head repeatedly.

Leaking the secrets of the Drizzle Pavilion—even lunatics were afraid of that...

“Really not saying it?”

“Don’t you know the Pavilion’s tenets? That is the creed of every assassin...”

“You’re still afraid of those?”

“Only members of the Drizzle Pavilion can...”

“I have the *Hall Before the Swallow*, so it’s not breaking the rules, and... I’ll pay extra.”

“...”

And so.

Xu Yiliu spilled everything, even offering to provide guidance.

Watching Xu Yiliu pour everything out like a bamboo tube, Li Mo suddenly felt that his previous efforts to disguise himself as the Northwest Hammer King to extract information were unnecessary.

Every assassin in the Drizzle Pavilion truly loves money.

If that’s the case...

Little Li started his brain working.

After getting the uninvited guest Xu Yiliu under control.

Everyone on the upper floor of the tavern finally turned their attention back to the center of the lake.

The Hidden Dragon List within the Dragon Gate had already inscribed more than half of the prodigies of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths.

【Hidden Dragon List #47: Zhiduolu.】

【Martial Arts: Seven Apertures Observing the Deity, Half-Demon Golden Roc Body, Great Mastery of the Qiyun Body Technique, Exquisite Blade Techniques, Great Mastery of a Unique Art, and possesses the method to release bloodline power, able to summon the Golden Roc Divine Will.】

【Achievements: In the Southern Frontier, took the head of a Seven Apertures General amidst ten thousand troops, released bloodline form, single-handedly broke through eight hundred armored soldiers.】

【Title: Sun-Hiding Golden Roc.】

Zhiduolu.

Yin Bing had some impression of this person.

This person later obtained some opportunity in the Southern Frontier and soared to the top ten of the Hidden Dragon List.

Later, he even climbed onto the Human List and Earth List, ranking quite high.

---

Even the Divine Will he observed later evolved into an Extreme Form.

“If I had been careless just now, I might have passed by?”

Li Mo turned his head, looking at the list being published.

“You won’t.” Just as he asked, the voice of the Ice Cube sounded in his ear.

Jiang Chulong held an apple, her gray-white eyes blinking:

“Big Brother Li, no... not yet.”

“I’ve been... watching all along.”

Jiang Chulong noticed something was wrong with Xu Yiliu very early on.

Because people lie, but swords don’t...

But she also knew that sword definitely couldn’t hurt Big Brother Li, so while others were distracted by the little episode, she had been watching the Hidden Dragon List the whole time.

Don’t think Chulong is silly; most of the time, she’s quite sharp.

“More than forty places, still not here.”

Xue Jing took a deep breath.

He felt it was close.

But...

Old Xue’s feeling was wrong.

【Hidden Dragon List #35: Zhang Shi’er.】

...

【Hidden Dragon List #29: Jia Tengying.】

...

【Hidden Dragon List #20: Xie Wanqiu.】

The prodigies登上 the Hidden Dragon List were becoming more and more famous, most of them figures renowned for a long time.

“I know this Jia Tengying. He won the championship at the Martial Arts Summit three sessions ago and created a unique finger technique himself, which is very powerful.”

“Isn’t Xie Wanqiu one of the sword prodigies of the Tianshan Sword Manor? How did he end up at twentieth place?”

“I think when Fairy Ying Bing explained the sword, her attainments were even superior, why haven’t we seen her?”

“Even if he just entered the Seven Apertures, he should be on the list...”

As everyone spoke, they quickly realized something.

But the top twenty already had the capital to fight Inner Scene experts head-on!

Tang Xiaobao looked at Elder Qian and his master, who seemed to have signs of high blood pressure and difficulty breathing.

So he dipped his finger in his teacup.

At that moment, the Dragon Gate began to inscribe the nineteenth place:

【Hidden Dragon List #19: Li Mo】

【Martial Arts: Seven Apertures Observing the Deity, possesses a Unique Art of Body Tempering, swordsmanship is outstanding, walking the path of technique approaching the Dao. However, it is suspected that his talent for a certain heavy weapon is even more world-shocking, and he possesses an extremely powerful secret technique.

It is worth mentioning that his face greatly benefits his wife...】

【Achievements: Destroyed a crumbling pocket dimension, fought Han Zhen and Yin Huaxuan head-on together with Yin Bing, sabotaged the Drizzle Pavilion’s Unfettered Trial, and at the Yunzhou Assembly, together with Yin Bing, repelled the Demoness of Heaven Yin Mianmian.】

【Title: Solitary Odd Sword, Wife-Buffing Fighting Soul.】

“It’s Li Jianxian! Young Hero Li!”

“Seven Apertures, nineteenth on the Hidden Dragon List? Behind him are a pile of Nine Apertures experts!”

“In the history of the Hidden Dragon List, has anyone ever ranked so high with such a cultivation level?”

“Wife-Buffing Fighting Soul? May I ask if Young Hero Li is married?”

“I am the richest man in Yunzhou. If Young Hero Li is willing to marry my daughter, the dowry will be half of my fortune!”

The shores of the Fish Dragon Lake immediately boiled.

“???”

Only Little Li himself fell into deep thought.

*Solitary Odd Sword* was quite fitting, he had no opinion on that.

But what in the world is *Wife-Buffing Fighting Soul*? Huh? Doesn’t that sound strange? Ah?

Hmm...

Li Mo suddenly knew where this title came from.

It was Tian Miao!

“Is there nothing else to report? Even writing this down?!”

Li Mo had a bit of a headache.

Although Tian Miao didn’t see the World Seed and Divine Weapon on him and didn’t cause his reputation to collapse, this wasn’t much better than that...

Immediately after, the Dragon Gate revealed the next name.

【Hidden Dragon List #18: Yin Bing】
