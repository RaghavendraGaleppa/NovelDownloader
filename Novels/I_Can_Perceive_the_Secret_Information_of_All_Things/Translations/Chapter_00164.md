# Chapter 164: Mid Core Formation Stage

The most valuable treasures in Qinglian Manor were two items. The first was the oil of the Glazed Immortal Lamp, which Xiao Ji had already absorbed and temporarily stored using the lamp's wick. The second was the Nine-Petaled Lotus. If revived, this lotus could produce nine precious elixirs every sixty years—it too had been temporarily placed inside Xiao Ji's storage artifact.
