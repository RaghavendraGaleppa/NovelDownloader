# Chapter 118: Breaking Through the Barrier, the New Mountain's Champion!

Time passed unnoticed in the throes of cultivation.

In the blink of an eye, three months had gone by.

The crowd gathered outside the Qian Yuan Cave grew larger, but as time dragged on, a hint of anxiety crept into their expressions.

"Why hasn't he emerged yet? Could Senior Brother Gu have failed?" asked a nervous common-born cultivator in the crowd.

His concern was understandable. Breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage wasn't a life-or-death seclusion—it demanded swift, decisive progress. Typically, if one hadn't succeeded after two months, the chances of success became vanishingly slim. Yet Gu Yuan had been in seclusion for a full three months with no word.

"Impossible! With Senior Brother Gu's abilities—defeating six aristocratic cultivators single-handedly and securing eight spiritual energies—how could someone like him fail at Foundation Establishment? Such talent hasn't been seen in the sect for years!" another common-born disciple retorted.

"Who can say for sure? Foundation Establishment isn't about combat prowess—it depends on innate talent and comprehension. I heard Senior Brother Gu only has five spiritual apertures, which suggests mediocre aptitude," someone else countered pessimistically, their expression darkening.

"Senior Sister Bian, Senior Brother Ji, and Senior Brother Feng—the three who competed with Senior Brother Gu in the secret realm—all successfully established their foundations a month ago and distributed their spiritual energies. Even the four he defeated have advanced. Yet Senior Brother Gu..."

The three-month wait had dulled many expectations. They had thought Senior Brother Gu would astonish them again, emerging first as the new champion of the sect's mountain. But now, the Qian Yuan Cave remained eerily silent, devoid of any signs of breakthrough, leaving them uneasy.

"Brother Su, if Gu Yuan dies, what happens to the extra spiritual energies he possesses?" whispered an aristocratic disciple to his companion.

"...There's no precedent for this. The Liuyan Banquet's secret realm competition was unprecedented. With his first-place abilities, surely he wouldn't fail?"

"Who knows? Nothing is certain. This depends on innate talent and comprehension!"

"If that's the case, we might have to wait thirty years under sect rules to contest this cave..."

"Thirty years? How can we wait that long? Isn't there a way to break into the cave and take the energies?"

"Difficult!"

"I have an idea, but it's a bit..."

**BOOM!**

As they whispered among themselves, a massive vortex suddenly appeared above the Qian Yuan Cave. The spiritual energy of the entire Jinyuan Island seemed to be drained in an instant, then violently poured back into the cave with an inexplicable force.

---

An indescribable aura surged from within the cave, rising relentlessly. Even the protective formation couldn't contain it. 

Moreover, the trampled spirit herbs, scattered flowers, and battered bamboo groves beneath their feet suddenly flourished—blossoms bloomed in abundance, fragrant herbs thrived, and the bamboo forest swayed like an ocean wave. All plant life grew vigorously, as if spring had arrived, bringing forth a riot of life.

Moisture filled the air, and a light drizzle seemed to fall, though the latter phenomenon was deliberately suppressed, unnoticed by the crowd. Their attention was wholly captured by the flourishing flora and the ever-intensifying aura from the cave.

"He's done it..."

"Senior Brother Gu has succeeded!"

All other thoughts were cast aside as they stared at the cave, their expressions filled with fervent anticipation.

"Shaking off the mortal firefly form, washing away the mundane to forge the Dao Foundation!"

A deep sigh echoed from the cave, followed by a young man in a Daoist robe and jade hairpin stepping out. With each step, flowers bloomed beneath his feet, as if he were an incarnation of the Green Emperor, commanding the growth of all plant life. Unseen by the crowd, faint glimmers of rain and golden light flickered around him.

He lifted his gaze slightly, and everyone felt their bodies stiffen, their souls seemingly seized—unable to move. 

The aura of Foundation Establishment far surpassed the mortal realm. With a lifespan of four hundred and fifty years, he was no longer a mere firefly.

"Senior Brother Gu—no, Uncle-Master Gu! I offer a supreme treasure, the Primordial Unity Mystic Water, in exchange for a strand of the Lunar Radiance Qi!"

"Uncle-Master! I am willing to serve you for a hundred years for just one strand of spiritual energy!"

"I pledge my loyalty to you, Uncle-Master, to aid you in attaining the position of True Successor—just one strand of energy!"

"Uncle-Master Gu! Uncle-Master Gu!"

The clamor was incessant. In their desperation for the Dao, these usually composed Qi Refinement cultivators behaved like commoners scrambling for scraps, their dignity forgotten.

But Gu Yuan didn't even glance back. With a flicker of movement, he vanished without relying on any magical tool, disappearing in an instant.

---

Countless landscapes blurred past him like fleeting shadows. Under the bright sky and drifting clouds, Gu Yuan felt an indescribable lightness in his heart.

He didn't use any magical artifact—his body moved like a streak of light through the heavens, propelled by pure mana.

This was freedom beyond imagination. A mere thought could carry him on the wind across ten thousand miles. Distance no longer bound him.

Within his dantian, a peculiar Dao Foundation hovered—shifting between mist, flowing water, and forged metal—constantly absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy.

A surging azure sea formed the waters, towering green trees wove a canopy of clouds, and a golden sword gleamed like the rising sun. Three entirely different scenes merged under an extraordinary force, flickering between reality and illusion.

Within this azure sea, green sky, and radiant sun, a faint silhouette sat cross-legged. Though indistinct, a slight lift of its eyes revealed a reflection of Gu Yuan himself.

This was the Threefold Dao Foundation Gu Yuan had forged—combining three energies into one, granting him power beyond the ordinary.

"It's done at last!"

Feeling the changes within him and gazing at the passing clouds, Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh. Years of arduous cultivation, countless great and small opportunities—finally, he had succeeded. 

With a lifespan of four to five hundred years, he was no longer an ordinary mortal. He could now glimpse the vastness of the heavens.

As he reveled in his flight, a towering spiritual peak came into view. 

The speed of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, even without external aids, far surpassed that of Qi Refinement disciples. 

Before Gu Yuan could fully savor the joy of soaring freely, he reached his destination. He halted his flight and descended before the mist-shrouded Ancient Yue Peak.

As if sensing his presence, the mist parted, revealing a path of swirling clouds. 

Gu Yuan flashed through the path in an instant, landing before a bamboo courtyard.

Above the courtyard hung a verdant plaque inscribed with two characters: "Bamboo Heart."

Inside, two elderly Daoists were sipping tea and playing a game of Go.

Seeing Gu Yuan arrive, one of them laughed heartily, "The new mountain's champion has arrived!"
