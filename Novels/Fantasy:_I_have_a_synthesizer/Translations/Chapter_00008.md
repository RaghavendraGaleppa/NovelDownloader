# Chapter 8: Five Thousand Nine Hundred Kilograms, the Class Beauty's Call!

The Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist!

Su Yu had already synthesized it before.

That was a martial skill truly cultivated by warriors!

A Tier 2 martial skill!

According to the synthesis panel's description, if cultivated to mastery, it could rival a Tier 3 martial skill.

What interested Su Yu most was the "essence of Yin-Yang" mentioned in its description.

"'Essence of Yin-Yang'? What kind of thing is that?" Su Yu's eyes flickered.

"'Forget it, I won't bother with it for now. I'll just cultivate it first!'"

With that, Su Yu opened the 'Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist' manual and began to cultivate.

Although Su Yu hadn't cultivated a martial skill before, with his current Blood Qi level, he was already considered mid-to-low tier even among Blood Qi Realm warriors. Even with poor comprehension, one could cultivate it with ease.

However, as Su Yu's gaze fell upon the 'Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist' manual, a strange sense of familiarity permeated his mind.

Su Yu narrowed his eyes slightly, continuously practicing the Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist in his mind.

Time flowed by leisurely.

He didn't know how much time had passed, but Su Yu suddenly opened his eyes. A sharp glint flashed.

"Hah!"

Placing the strength testing machine in the room, Su Yu licked his lips, a little anticipation in his eyes.

The next moment, he threw a punch.

Three thousand eight hundred kilograms!

Su Yu's eyebrows raised slightly. "'Without using martial skills, my pure strength is already considered top-tier for someone in the early Blood Qi Realm. If I use martial skills...'"

The next moment, the strength machine vibrated slightly. Scarlet numbers reappeared.

Five thousand nine hundred kilograms!

A warrior infinitely close to 6000 kilograms of strength!

Su Yu looked at the numbers before him, a faint smile irresistibly appearing on his lips.

"'Not bad!'"

After another simple cultivation session, thoroughly solidifying his mastery of the introductory 'Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist,' Su Yu finally relaxed for a moment.

As a Tier 2 martial skill, the Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist was a rare item, even within the entirety of Hengcheng. One must know, even powerful cultivators in the Blood Refinement Realm might not have the opportunity to cultivate a Tier 2 martial skill!

Su Yu felt quite pleased with himself. Just as he was about to pick up his phone to browse the warrior forums, his phone rang.

Looking at the name on the screen, Su Yu was momentarily stunned.

"Liu Yiyi!"

When he went to the Martial Arts Association for his assessment, he was alone. Besides the principal of First High School and the internal staff of the Martial Arts Association, no one else should know, right? Liu Yiyi's family background was decent in Hengcheng, but not to the extent of having connections with the Martial Arts Association. Moreover, he had just recently offended the two brothers from the Li family, and at this moment...

Everything seemed rather self-evident.

Su Yu sneered inwardly, looking at the remaining numbers on the testing machine in front of him, a subtle curve forming at the corner of his lips.

"'Oh, good!'"

With that, Su Yu hung up the phone.

Su Yu gazed out the window, his eyes deep.

"'So eager to make a move against me? Then let me see what power the illustrious Li Group truly possesses!'"

Su Yu clenched his fists, his heart utterly calm. Everything stemmed from Su Yu's strength!

Meanwhile, in a villa in Hengcheng.
