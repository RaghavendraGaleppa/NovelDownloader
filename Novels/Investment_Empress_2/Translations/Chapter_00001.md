# Chapter 1: My Childhood Sweetheart is the Future Empress? (1/2)

The Eastern Wasteland, the Purple Sun Mansion.

Under the clear blue sky, the main road was bustling with the clamor of carriages and horses. The caravan consisted of over a hundred people and more than a dozen carriages, all rushing along the road.

A young man in silk clothes lifted the carriage curtain, his face pale as he tried to breathe in some fresh air.

"Haa..."

"Traveling long distances in the ancient era is truly a killer. Cough."

The young man lifted the curtain, only to be met with billowing dust that made him cough twice.

"Young Master, it's still a two-day journey to the Clear Abyss Sect," the coachman driving the carriage said with an obsequious smile. He then carefully added, "Our mansion's carriage is already the most comfortable for traveling."

"Alright."

Li Mo responded with a sigh in his heart.

High-speed trains and airplanes were much more comfortable.

Two days ago, he had broken through the amnesia of the womb and awakened his memories from his previous life.

The place he lived in his previous life was called Blue Star, a place with advanced modern technology.

The Great Yu was different.

This was a world where everyone revered martial arts, and great power belonged to the individual.

He was now sixteen years old. Before he could even enjoy the leisurely life of an ancient aristocratic family to the fullest, his father stuffed him into a carriage and sent him to the Clear Abyss Sect, one of the three great sects of the Purple Sun Mansion, to participate in the entrance assessment.

"Practicing martial arts..."

Li Mo revealed a yearning look, gazing at the three suns hanging high in the sky.

On the road, he had heard other youths heading to the Clear Abyss Sect say that in this world's martial arts, someone like his father, who was like a humanoid giant robot, was only at the Stubborn Bronze level.

Legend had it that the three suns in the sky were the forms of the two previous emperors of the Great Yu.

This was not a myth or legend, but a history with clear records.

An hour later.

Dusk began to fall.

The caravan, escorted by the escort agency, slowly stopped at a post station.

As soon as Li Mo jumped out of the carriage, the curtain of the carriage behind his was also lifted.

A girl in an indigo cloth dress, her skin as delicate as white porcelain under the moonlight.

Her body, at the age of a maiden, had begun to take on a graceful shape, and her figure was almost as tall as Li Mo's.

The consecutive days of travel and the torment of illness had added a touch of fragility to her stunningly beautiful and noble face, yet she was still breathtakingly beautiful.

She was tired, weak, and dressed plainly, but the moment one saw her, one could believe that the phrase "the six palaces' beauties had no color" was not just a metaphor.

The name of the girl surfaced in Li Mo's mind.

Ying Bing.

The Li family and the Ying family were old friends, their close ties dating back to their grandparents' generation.

By their generation, the elders of both families were even more intent on撮合 the younger generation to marry, to strengthen the bond.

"What do you want to eat? I'll tell the kitchen to prepare it," Li Mo said casually.

The girl turned a deaf ear to him. Her eyes, like mirrors of ice, didn't even glance at Li Mo as she walked past him into the post station, leaving only a faint, elegant fragrance.

"Miss Ying's family just had a change of fortune, that's why..."

"No need to explain for her. It's because I was too outrageous in the past," Li Mo said helplessly.

What a sin.

How did I become a spoiled brat after transmigrating to another world?

With a wealthy family background and being doted on by everyone, he had done plenty of foolish things.

For instance, secretly watching the little maids bathe, hiding firecrackers in the firewood pile...

A few years ago, a disaster beast entered the city, and the entire Ying family was unfortunately killed, leaving only Ying Bing. His father then let her stay at the Li Mansion first.

He used to deliberately bully her while secretly liking her.

It was a bit like a middle school student liking a girl and then deliberately pulling her hair to get her attention...

"As everyone knows, those whose entire family is offered up as a sacrifice are usually no simple characters."

As a novel enthusiast in his previous life, Li Mo made an irrelevant association.

"Chicken soup is here!"

The inn attendant came in with a beaming smile, holding a tray.

The corner of Li Mo's mouth twitched, and he muttered to himself:

"Good for me, I've lived two lives, but why don't I have a golden finger or something..."

"Hello, you do."

"Who's talking?"

Li Mo jumped up as if his tail had been stepped on.

"Young Master?" The coachman looked confused. What was his young Master acting up about again?

"It's nothing, maybe it's tinnitus."

Li Mo frowned. Just as he was suspecting himself of auditory hallucinations, the voice sounded in his heart again:

"Since the host has sincerely asked, this system has no choice but to appear."

Li Mo: "...?"

Does that mean if I hadn't asked, you wouldn't have shown up in this lifetime?

Well, that's not the point.

"What can you do, System?"

"This system is an Investment Rebate System."

"The host can invest in any target. The stronger the 'Destiny' of the investment target, the better the reward."

"If the investment target makes a major breakthrough, additional rewards can also be obtained."

Li Mo raised an eyebrow slightly.

Any target?

"Can I invest in myself?"

"A Destiny Divine Eye has been issued to the host. Whether it has investment value, please judge for yourself."

So that's a yes.

Just as Li Mo thought this, he suddenly felt that something inexplicable had been added to his mind. He couldn't see it or touch it, but it truly existed.

He didn't know the subtleties of that thing, but he found he could use it.

However, the inexplicable information was obscure and difficult to understand, neither sound nor text.

Destiny Divine Eye?

Li Mo frowned. How was he supposed to read this?

The next moment, a panel suddenly appeared before his eyes, seemingly a human-friendly modification.

**[Name: Li Mo]**
**[Age: 16]**
**[Bone Structure: None.]**
**[Realm: Mortal.]**
**[Destiny: Grey (Innate Deficiency, Troubled Fate)]**
**[Evaluation: Innate deficiency, leading to a weak and frail body, not a material for martial arts. Besides being a bit handsome and having a good father, what else do you have? What are you? ]**
**[Recent Encounter: Met this system.]**

Li Mo: "..."

Too real.

---

A bit impolite, but it had to be admitted, there was indeed no investment value.

"Among the people from the county going to the Clear Abyss Sect together, there must be a few good seedlings."

Li Mo lost his appetite for food and looked up.

A dim light flashed in his eyes as he looked at the fellow villagers resting and eating in the hall.

**[Name: He Yong]**
**[Age: 16]**
**[Bone Structure: None.]**
**[Realm: First Pulse of the Blood and Qi Realm.]**
**[Destiny: White (Cattail Grass Stature)]**
**[Evaluation: The common multitude, cattail grass and mayflies, nothing to write home about.]**
**[Encounter: From a firewood-cutting background, travel expenses were borrowed from neighbors, currently worried about paying back the money.]**

......

**[Name: Chen Xiaoyan]**
**[Age: 16]**
**[Bone Structure: None.]**
**[...]**

...

...

After looking at several people, most had white Destiny, with the highest being green.

It wasn't until Li Mo's gaze fell on a corner that a blue-green color appeared before his eyes.

**[Name: Wang Hu]**
**[Age: 16]**
**[Bone Structure: Tiger Arm, Leopard Waist.]**
**[Realm: Third Pulse of the Blood and Qi Realm.]**
**[Destiny: Green (Slightly Gifted)]**
**[Evaluation: Slightly talented. If he studies and trains diligently, he might achieve something in the future. However, he is narrow-minded, holds grudges, and is arrogant and domineering, making it easy for him to walk a radical path.]**
**[Recent Encounter: His fist technique has hit a bottleneck and he urgently needs a sparring partner to make a breakthrough.]**

......

In short, there was no particularly worthy investment target.

The only one who looked decent, Wang Hu, had a conflict with him.

At this time.

"Sir, the chicken soup you ordered. As requested, we put in a ten-year-old wild ginseng."

"I'll bring it up to the second floor for you."

The inn attendant gave a shout and was about to carry the food box upstairs.

"Wait."

Li Mo's heart stirred, and he stopped him:

"I'll take it up myself."

Under the inn attendant's puzzled gaze, Li Mo took the food box.

His gaze was fixed on the room at the far end of the second floor.

What kind of Destiny would she have?

Knock, knock—

After knocking for a moment, a soft voice came from inside:

"Come in."

The girl sat quietly by the window. Moonlight shone through the gauze window onto her water-like black hair, reflecting a faint light in her eyes.

发现 it was Li Mo who entered, her delicate brows furrowed slightly.

But Li Mo didn't have time to observe her expression; he was already completely stunned on the spot.

Before his eyes, the other party's information was clearly displayed:

**[Name: Ying Bing]**
**[Age: 16]**
**[Bone Structure: Extreme Yin Moon Phoenix Body.]**
**[Realm: None.]**
**[Destiny: ...]**

At this point, the Destiny Divine Eye seemed to glitch slightly, as if the karmic burden on the other party was too great, causing it to freeze.

After a few seconds, the subsequent information slowly appeared.

**[Destiny: Red (Bearing an Emperor Bone, Ice as Fate, Autumn Water as Spirit, has the appearance of a Phoenix Ruling the Heavens)]**
**[Evaluation: Fate is full of calamities, but she always turns bad luck into good. At this time, her feathers are not yet full. When the winds and clouds change, she will surely hang high in the nine heavens and ten earths, a phoenix ruling the eight desolations and six directions.]**
**[Recent Encounter: Before the Extreme Yin Moon Phoenix Body is opened, it externally manifests as a Meridian Severing Body. Before she can fully control the Extreme Yin power, she must endure the pain of extreme cold every day.]**

Li Mo: "?"

Well, what did I tell you?

There isn't even a color; it's calculated by phenomena.

According to the judgment of the Destiny Divine Eye, Destiny, from lowest to highest, is:

Black, Grey, White, Green, Blue, Purple, Gold.

Above Gold, there is also Red Destiny.

Such Destiny cannot be divided by a single color alone; they all have various phenomena.

The Grand Ancestor Martial Emperor, who stabilized the nine heavens and ten earths for the human race and founded the Great Yu, was clearly recorded in the historical records as having been born with the sun and moon in the sky together, the Purple Star moving, and a divine turtle carrying a stele to give him a name.

Thinking about it, this is also the so-called Destiny Phenomenon.

My future wife is an existence that can rival the Grand Ancestor Martial Emperor?

That's... quite sudden.

Little Li Mo fell into deep thought, questioning his life.

"Uh... chicken soup, drink it while it's hot."

Slam—

The door was closed.

"So it was on this day that I returned."

"Nirvana and rebirth, so that's what it meant."

Ying Bing picked up a piece of chicken and threw it from the second-floor window into the backyard.

The yellow dog guarding the yard wolfed it down. After a while, there was no abnormality.

It was just ordinary chicken soup?

It wasn't about holding a grudge. Besides close relatives, those distant loves and hates were like passing clouds to her.

It's just that in her memory, Li Mo liked to play tricks on her with childish methods.

Why did he主动 bring chicken soup today?

"Ding-dong—"

At this moment, a crisp sound suddenly rang in her ear.

"Who?"

Ying Bing's eyes narrowed instantly.

The sound seemed to ignore her vigilance and sounded again on its own:

"System binding successful."

"The victor becomes king, the loser becomes dust. Are you... ready?"
