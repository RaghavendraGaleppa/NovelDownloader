# Chapter 57: Su Shiyu

Xu Yunfan let out a sigh of relief, but he was also secretly surprised by how fast news traveled. In just half a night, even the person before him had already heard about it.

As she spoke, she couldn't help but wave her hands excitedly, her eyes filled with longing.

"They say a master skilled in the hammer arts came out of the black market and was ambushed by a group of fake manual peddlers. Unfortunately, the robbery failed, and the master turned the tables, killing them instead. Dozens of corpses were left at the scene. It was truly tragic."

"Truly, feuds and revenge killings are thrilling. This calls for a toast!"

Su Shiyu drained her cup in one gulp and praised, "I wonder which great hero has such incredible skills. If I could meet and befriend them, it would be worth dying for!"

Xu Yunfan was speechless. If dozens of people, each with the strength of the one-eyed man from before, were to surround him from all sides, he would also find it difficult to fight against so many. He would have to find an opportunity to break through and move around, defeating them one by one before it would be possible.

Seeing Xu Yunfan lost in thought, Su Shiyu unconsciously leaned forward.

"Brother Xu, why aren't you speaking?"

Su Shiyu suddenly leaned closer, her almond-shaped eyes twinkling with mischief.

"Could it be... that last night's incident has something to do with you? After all, Brother Xu is also a master of the hammer."

Her words were meant as a joke, but they made Xu Yunfan's heart skip a beat. He laughed it off.

"Su Gongzi, you're joking. I was studying martial arts at Qinghe Residence last night and didn't even step out of the courtyard. I was just thinking about what kind of strength this person must have to be able to take on a hundred men."

Su Shiyu was just making a joke and didn't pay it much mind. After Xu Yunfan changed the subject, she immediately picked up the topic.

Seeing Xu Yunfan lower his eyes and fiddle with the fish on his plate, she immediately raised her voice to continue.

"They might be a Three-Training Martial Teacher, or perhaps they've already taken a step further and achieved the External Three Unions!..."

Su Shiyu stood up, her face filled with excitement and a fervor unique to a passionate youth.

"A Grand Master of the External Three Unions, if placed in the military, would be a general commanding thousands of troops. One great roar on the battlefield could make enemy generals a hundred paces away die of fright!"

That was an exaggeration. A bit too much of an exaggeration.

Xu Yunfan thought silently to himself.

Back in Ningguta, the commotion from the deathmatch between the two External Three Unions Grand Masters, Yuan Zhang and Zhang Shuyang, was quite significant, but a single roar to kill an enemy general was still beyond their capabilities.

As Su Shiyu continued her tale, Xu Yunfan silently dipped a piece of sashimi into a small celadon dish. Amber-colored soy sauce slid down the jade-white flesh.

The red-scaled sturgeon hidden at the bottom of the Lancang River, a hundred miles from North Ye City, could only be caught when the river froze over in the twelfth lunar month. Old fishermen would have to凿开 a three-foot-thick layer of ice and use nets woven from silkworms by the riverbank to catch a few.

This plate had only eight slices, yet it cost eighty taels of silver.

Usually, it stays deep at the bottom of the river. Only in winter, when the surface is frozen and old fishermen break the ice, does it come up for air.

Even so, only fishermen with excellent swimming skills could possibly catch it.

The tip of the tooth broke through the creamy texture, and a refreshing sweetness instantly washed over the tongue.

The flesh was as crisp as fresh snow yet tough as spring bamboo shoots, melting into a warm stream that flowed down the throat before one could even savor it.

Once it went down, within less than three quarters of an hour, a rising warmth spread from his stomach, making his entire body feel warm and comfortable, as if soaking in a hot spring.

Long-term consumption could strengthen the body and boost blood energy. It was truly excellent.

If he could eat this every day, the efficiency of gaining proficiency from training martial arts would definitely double.

Just as he was eating, the sound of unhurried hoofbeats came from outside the tavern.

Xu Yunfan leaned to the side and looked out the window. He saw the caravan he had met in the withered woods outside the city yesterday. Twenty ebony carriages were rolling over the bluestone road. The Su family's black bird emblem on the carriage shafts glimmered in the rare sunlight.

"The Su family's caravan."

Su Shiyu poked her head out to take a look, casually remarking before sitting back down and leisurely eating and drinking.

"The Su family?"

"Yeah, the Su family is in the reselling business. Grain from Yingzhou, iron from Wuzhou, brocade from Zhongzhou, and medicinal herbs from Qingzhou."

Su Shiyu counted on her slender, white fingers.

"Last year, Wuzhou suffered a severe drought. The Su family made a fortune just by reselling old grain."

She dipped some wine on the table and wrote the character "Three," then added a string of circles after it, her face full of emotion.

"One trip was enough to buy my entire family and still have plenty to spare."

She paused, then said enthusiastically, "I heard the Su family has a famous daughter named Su Suwen. She's incredibly sharp, a business prodigy. Even the current Empress has praised her several times."

Xu Yunfan listened to Su Shiyu's torrent of words while quietly watching the Su family caravan disappear into the distance.

The Su family was extraordinary. A caravan heading to a small border city had guards who were at least Second-Training Martial Teachers.

After finishing the meal with a contented Su Shiyu, Xu Yunfan deftly slung the heavy golden hammers onto his back, leaving Su Shiyu full of envy.

She couldn't help but click her tongue. "Over two hundred catties, yet in your hands, it's as light as a goose feather. Even if you've trained your skin, to handle it so effortlessly, you must have at least reached minor success in skin training, right? Last year, the Cangzhou boxer my father hired was red in the face just from swinging a hundred-catties stone lock."

Xu Yunfan smiled without answering. Instead, he asked, "If you yearn for the life of the Jianghu so much, why don't you practice martial arts yourself?"

Upon hearing this, Su Shiyu sighed dejectedly. "My father says practicing martial arts has no future. When the Empress ascends the throne, there will be a grand imperial examination to select officials. Since I have no interest in marriage, I should focus on my studies and pass the exam to get an official position."

Women could also become officials?

Xu Yunfan was a bit surprised, but he wasn't optimistic about this system introduced by the Empress's reforms.

Although the Empress had ascended the throne, this era was still one of a highly traditional feudal landlord class. The idea of women holding up half the sky was a demonic shock to their way of thinking that was completely unacceptable.

"Then I wish you the best of luck."

Xu Yunfan said casually. Su Shiyu didn't look happy upon hearing this and shook her head. "I still want to practice martial arts."

Xu Yunfan said, "There are four martial arts schools in North Ye City. Why don't you go and try?"

"I did. But they all know my father and won't take me."

Xu Yunfan was speechless. The Su family of North Ye City had a great reputation. He had also heard of the Su family patriarch. If the old master had given the word not to teach her, the schools in the city would naturally give him face.

There was nothing Xu Yunfan could do about this.

After offering a few words of comfort, he said goodbye to Su Shiyu and returned to Qinghe Residence to continue studying the Iron Bridge Fortress Bone-Forging Chapter.

Until the moon was high in the sky, Xu Yunfan glanced at the information prompt that had appeared in his vision.

Although he had not yet reached the entry level to form a skill on his attribute panel, he had a feeling that within three days, it would definitely appear in the skill栏.

Once it appeared, the steps mentioned in the silk scroll—such as applying secret medicine, massaging and breaking the bones, and then letting them heal—could be completely skipped, and he could rely on proficiency to enter the skill.

For the next three days, Xu Yunfan basically didn't leave his room, completely burying himself in studying the Iron Bridge Fortress Bone-Forging Chapter.

Until late on the third day, Xu Yunfan, his eyes bloodshot, stared intently at the silk scroll in his hand.

'When you first began studying the Iron Bridge Fortress Bone-Forging Chapter, you were at a loss. After many days of hard thinking, you finally have a clue, but the path ahead is still shrouded in mist.'
