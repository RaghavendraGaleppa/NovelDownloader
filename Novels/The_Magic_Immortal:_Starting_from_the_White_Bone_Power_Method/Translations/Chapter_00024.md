# Chapter 24: The Tiger-Python!

After crossing the mountain stream, Wang Chan felt an inexplicable unease, as if something was watching him. Whether it was his imagination or not, his entire body prickled with discomfort.

He stopped and surveyed his surroundings, extending his spiritual senses, but found nothing. With no other choice, he continued forward cautiously, keeping his senses sharp within a radius of several zhang.

After traveling three or four li, he arrived at a vast stretch of forest. The woods were shrouded in mist, filled with poisonous gases and miasma. A single breath could be dangerously intoxicating, so he avoided it at all costs.

Wang Chan stuck to the edge of the forest path, frequently glancing inside, wary of any beast that might charge out. However, once he passed this forest, he would be able to see Lotus Mountain in the distance, and the rest of the journey would be smooth sailing.

Suddenly, a ferocious roar echoed from within the forest—something between a wolf's howl and a dog's bark—accompanied by the sounds of a fierce struggle. Without a doubt, two demonic beasts were fighting.

Wang Chan had no interest in spectating. Instead, he grew even more cautious and quickened his pace. But after only a few dozen steps, another roar rang out. This one was softer, resembling a cow's moan but not quite, and carried a weak, almost pitiful tone. Yet, when the sound reached his ears, it felt like a tiger's roar—deeply unsettling, freezing him in place for a split second.

"That sounded like a cow…" Wang Chan muttered to himself. "But also like a tiger… A tiger-python! It must be that tiger-python!"

Python-type demonic beasts were exceedingly rare, especially in a remote wilderness like Lotus Mountain. If there was one here, the most likely candidate was the very creature the Beauty Mole had mentioned—the tiger-python that had awakened a high-grade divine ability.

Wang Chan hadn’t studied *The Record of Three Thousand Demonic Beasts* for nothing. He had practically memorized every word about the tiger-python. There was no mistaking it.

The roar sounded both agonized and weak—clear signs that the tiger-python was injured, and severely so.

At this realization, Wang Chan’s heart pounded uncontrollably. His body burned with excitement, and his blood surged. But he didn’t act rashly. Instead, he turned sharply toward the direction of the roar and listened intently.

After a few moments, he instinctively checked his equipment, ensuring everything was in place. Then, without hesitation, he stealthily advanced toward the source of the sound.

A short while later, deep within the forest, Wang Chan hid beneath an enormous tree—one so massive that three or four people couldn’t wrap their arms around its trunk. His gaze followed the terrain ahead, where a gentle slope led into a valley overgrown with weeds and low shrubs.

The vegetation in the valley had been thoroughly trampled. A massive crimson hound, nearly three meters tall, darted and weaved, occasionally firing a crimson sword-light from the third eye on its forehead. The attacks were aimed at a black, single-horned python lying ahead.

The sword-light targeted the python’s eyes.

The python’s head resembled a tiger’s—large and imposing—while its body stretched an impressive fifteen meters. At the moment, it lay on the ground, a wound running from the back of its head all the way to its tail, seemingly frozen over by ice. A chilling aura seeped from the injury, and there was no visible blood—likely frozen solid.

Unable to dodge, the python could only squeeze its eyes shut and endure the crimson sword-light, retaliating with desperate bursts of water arrows. Strangely, despite the python’s aura being only low-grade, and the crimson hound’s mid-grade strength combined with its formidable sword-light ability, the attacks barely left faint white marks on the python’s eyes, failing to pierce its defenses.

However, the crimson hound was too agile, effortlessly dodging the python’s water arrows and maintaining a relentless assault.

"That’s the mid-grade demonic beast—the Three-Eyed Crimson Hound…" Wang Chan narrowed his eyes.

The scenario was clear: the python had been severely wounded by someone, fled, and was now being hunted by the hound. It wouldn’t be long before the python succumbed.

But who could have injured a high-grade python like this? The Beauty Mole had mentioned gathering allies to hunt the tiger-python… and she had ascended Lotus Mountain earlier that morning. Could it be…?

A suspicion formed in Wang Chan’s mind.

Sure enough, moments later, the python could no longer defend itself. Two crimson sword-lights pierced its eyes, sealing its fate. With a final, pitiful groan, the python bared its fangs and spat out a single python tooth.

*Whoosh!*

Like a blade cutting through air, a black streak flashed—and one of the hound’s legs was severed, blood spraying everywhere.

But the python had spent its last strength. Its head slumped to the ground, lifeless, leaving a small crater where it landed.

The hound howled in agony, collapsing as its vitality waned. It desperately licked its bleeding stump, exhaling crimson demonic energy in an attempt to heal.

"Strike while it’s weak!"

Without hesitation, Wang Chan prepared to ambush the hound with his black needles—but then, the ground behind the hound suddenly bulged.

A massive peach blossom phantom erupted from the earth, and before the hound could react, three black spikes shot toward its head.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

The spikes struck an unexpected crimson armor that shimmered around the hound, deflecting the attack and sending the spikes rebounding back into the phantom.

Despite its injury, the hound lunged at the phantom, and the two engaged in a fierce battle.

That familiar peach blossom phantom, that unmistakable sinister aura—it was none other than Madame Cheng, that wretched woman!

Wang Chan quickly retracted his needles and continued observing.

The Three-Eyed Crimson Hound lived up to its fearsome reputation as a mid-grade demonic beast of Lotus Mountain. Not only had it outlasted the tiger-python, but even with a severed leg, it fought Madame Cheng to a standstill. With its crimson armor, sword-eye ability, and formidable physique, it held its own against Madame Cheng’s three mid-grade spikes and her peach blossom phantom.

But the hound was bleeding profusely, unable to stop the blood loss. If the fight dragged on, it would soon follow the python’s fate.

Realizing this, the hound fought desperately.

The smartest tactic now would be to prolong the battle and wear Madame Cheng down. Yet, instead of retreating, she pressed the attack aggressively—as if she were in a hurry.

This puzzled Wang Chan.

A few moments later, Madame Cheng suddenly screamed, staggering as if her limbs had gone weak. Crimson patterns spread across her face, and red fur sprouted from her skin.

"Crimson Venom ability?!" she shrieked in disbelief. "Damnable beast! You have the Crimson Sword *and* the Crimson Venom?!"

Before she could react further, the hound pounced, pinning her beneath it and clawing frantically at her peach blossom shield.

Then, with a cold snarl, Madame Cheng gritted her teeth. Her pores dilated, releasing a cloud of pink mist as the peach blossom phantom whirled violently.

In an instant, the hound was ensnared.

What followed was a grotesque spectacle.

Soon, Madame Cheng reversed their positions, dominating the hound as it whimpered in pain, struggling helplessly beneath the phantom’s crushing force. Though it summoned its crimson armor in a last-ditch effort, it was futile—only barely managing to protect itself.

Watching this, Wang Chan nearly lost his jaw in shock.
