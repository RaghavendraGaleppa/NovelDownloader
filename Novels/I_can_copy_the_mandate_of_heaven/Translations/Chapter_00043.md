## Chapter 43: Legacy

The butler bowed his head and said, "We do have an excellent candidate, but the price cannot be too low." 

High Changdong sneered, not interested in being manipulated by this petty person. However, the butler seemed to be aware of his thoughts.

The butler continued, "We have a group of officials' daughters who were arrested and imprisoned. We managed to rescue them from the Jiaosi Fang, and they are now available. The youngest is 14, and the oldest is 17."

"These girls are well-educated, and their upbringing is impeccable. After experiencing such a significant change, they have lost their arrogance and will be extremely grateful."

The butler implied that these girls would make excellent "adopted daughters" for wealthy families, which was similar to what the Qixuan Gate was looking for.

High Changdong agreed to see the girls, and the butler mentioned that the price for each girl was not less than 1,000 taels.

Meanwhile, in the medicinal valley, the mourning period for Mo Dafu had ended. The coffin was carried to the back of the main peak, and the burial ceremony began. 

As they buried Mo Dafu, Li Zhiming couldn't help but feel a sense of loss. The medicinal valley seemed much quieter now, and the memories of Mo Dafu were slowly fading away.

Li Zhiming sat at Mo Dafu's desk, looking at the incomplete "medication prescription" left behind. It was the "Maboi San" that Mo Dafu had spent two years researching, which would allow Li Zhiming to practice the Qixianggong without feeling pain.

Li Zhiming decided to entrust Meng Weizhi to investigate Mo Dafu's family in Lan Zhou and take care of them when Han Li grew up.

Studying the prescription, Li Zhiming realized that the key to Maboi San was not just to numb the pain but to keep the person awake while their body was being repaired.

The medication was essentially an "obstacle drug" that would allow the patient to remain conscious while their body was being rebuilt.

Later, Han Li brought a box and a map to Li Zhiming. A golden token fell out of the map with three blurry characters: "Sheng Xian Ling". 

The token seemed to hold a mysterious significance, and Li Zhiming was intrigued.
