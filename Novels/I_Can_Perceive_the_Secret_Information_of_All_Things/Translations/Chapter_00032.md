# Chapter 32: What Are You Laughing At?

Chuyun Town, Kaishan Escort Agency.

The premises had been cordoned off, and the stench of blood could be detected even before entering the courtyard.

All the bodies had been moved to the main hall, each covered with a white cloth.

Fortunately, it was winter. Otherwise, the decaying corpses along with flies and insects would have made the scene even more unpleasant.

Constable Chang Ping introduced the situation to his colleagues from other jurisdictions, hoping to gather some useful suggestions.

Rumor had it that among the visiting officers was an exceptionally capable constable from Yangliu Town who had recently solved several major cases, clearing a backlog of serious crimes.

This was why Song Yuanbao had been invited—to witness the prowess of Yangliu Town's fastest constable.

Indeed, Song seemed quite capable, speaking with profound wisdom, though his words often left others puzzled.

The Taoist priest he brought along, however, appeared rather ordinary, speaking little. It was unclear why Song had enlisted such an unremarkable outsider—perhaps a relative in need of support.

"Constable Song, seven people died in the courtyard alone. The scene has been marked with lime," Chang Ping explained. "As you can see, weapon racks were scattered everywhere. Many escorts put up resistance, but the outcome was the same as in previous cases—all killed with a single sword strike... I strongly suspect this was an organized, premeditated massacre. The killer couldn't have acted alone..."

"If not one person, then there must have been at least two," Song Yuanbao nodded seriously.

"Based on my examination, it was the work of a single individual. There couldn't have been a second person," Coroner Wang Dajiu interjected.

With the professional's opinion, the investigation could focus on finding just one perpetrator.

Xiao Ji knew Wang Dajiu's statement was meant to mislead the investigation, steering it toward becoming an unsolved case.

"Boss, he's awake," a constable reported, rushing from the backyard to inform Chang Ping.

He was referring to Han Kaishan's regained consciousness.

The chief escort had been unconscious from his injuries. According to case records, he was discovered and resuscitated, though his cultivation had been completely destroyed.

The group proceeded to the backyard.

In the master bedroom, they found Han Kaishan on the verge of death.

The burly man looked extremely weak, his eyes bloodshot.

"Save them quickly," were Han's first words upon seeing Chang Ping and the others.

"Everyone's dead. You're the lucky one—there's no one left to save," Wang Dajiu said from the back. "Your wounds are severe, but you were fortunate. If not for your slightly higher cultivation, you'd have shared their fate."

"Bullshit! Your family's the one that's dead!" Han Kaishan retorted angrily, coughing violently from the exertion.

"Chief Han, please rest. Don't trouble yourself with other matters for now," Chang Ping said, shooting Wang Dajiu a displeased look. "Coroner Wang, you must be tired. Find a room to rest. We'll call if we need your expertise."

"Indeed exhausted. Have someone fetch me some wine and meat to replenish my energy," Wang Dajiu said before leaving the main room.

His task here was complete.

Xiao Ji understood that Wang Dajiu's sudden interjection was meant to convey a message to Han Kaishan—that all witnesses were dead, leaving no loose ends, so he could rest easy.

Han's reaction confirmed this.

Initially, his expression showed faint worry, but after the coughing fit, that trace of concern vanished entirely.

To ordinary eyes, these subtle shifts would go unnoticed.

But they couldn't escape Xiao Ji's perception.

He began probing Han Kaishan's secrets.

[Han Kaishan, 48, founder of Kaishan Escort Agency, fifth level Qi Refinement martial artist, prominent figure in Chuyun Town with good industry reputation and sociable nature.]

The surface information was unimportant. Xiao Ji dug deeper.

[He wounded himself with a sword, allowing spiritual energy to corrode his bones. Though treated and saved, his cultivation is nearly gone.]

Pushing further, Xiao Ji expanded his perception to a forty-zhang radius, enveloping the entire escort agency.

All gathered information revealed the sinister conspiracy behind the massacre.

Han Kaishan had accepted a request from his friend Cui Dubu.

That afternoon, Cui had rushed over, claiming the Life-Death Sect was after his family heirloom.

He asked Han to deliver it to Qingyin Temple in Giant Dragon City for safekeeping with the abbot.

The item's mystery proved too tempting. By the fourth watch, Han couldn't resist opening Cui's family box.

Inside lay an embroidered scroll.

Unfurled, it revealed a koi fish transformation tapestry. One fish's spine was woven with a zither string, seamlessly integrated into the colorful embroidery—a testament to the Cui family's craftsmanship.

Recognizing the zither string as the true treasure, Han touched it. Spiritual energy surged through his body, confirming its extraordinary nature—a supreme treasure that could accelerate cultivation and promise limitless potential.

Greed drove him mad.

After brief hesitation, murder took root. Coincidentally, Wang Dajiu had recently sought Life-Extending Pills.

Such pills were contraband across nations, as most were refined from human lives—extremely rare and prohibitively expensive.

Thus a scheme formed. Han struck a deal with Wang: arrange Cui's murder while Han would eliminate his own household.

Upon completion, Han would provide three human-heart Life-Extending Pills.

Before departure, Han hosted a farewell banquet in the front courtyard, toasting the escort team.

The poisoned escorts weakened drastically. Donning black attire, Han first slaughtered the team outside town, then returned to eliminate the rest at home, finally staging his own near-fatal injury.

"Ruthless. To avoid suspicion from the Life-Death Sect, he massacred his entire agency," Xiao Ji continued reading Han's memories.

Knowing the sect was aware of Cui's treasure and his connection to the escort agency, Han understood suspicion would inevitably fall on him after Cui's visit and the treasure's disappearance.

Thus the massacre served dual purposes—diverting both official and sect suspicion away from himself.

As for his lost cultivation, Han cared little. With the koi embroidery in hand, his path to power remained wide open.

Xiao Ji admired Han's cruelty and meticulous planning.

"After seeing off the team, I returned to my room. Suddenly hearing commotion in the front courtyard, I went to investigate—only to face a blindingly fast sword. The black-clad assailant's face was hidden, his cultivation immense. He struck me down before I could scream," Han recounted, his condition seemingly improved.

Having uncovered most truths, Xiao Ji found Han's lies amusing.

"What are you laughing at?" Han, hypersensitive, picked up on the subtle reaction.

"Nothing. Just recalled something amusing. My apologies," Xiao Ji said contritely, promising to contain his mirth.

Sometimes, watching someone lie so earnestly was genuinely funny.

"That man's sword was impossibly fast..." Han glared at Xiao Ji. "You're still laughing."

Others turned to the Taoist, noting his apparent cheerfulness.

In such grim circumstances, even if unaffected, one should at least feign solemnity rather than smile.

The man had suffered terribly.

"Chief Escort, please understand—just as sadness brings tears, happy thoughts prompt smiles. A natural reaction," Xiao Ji explained. "After all, human sorrows and joys seldom intersect."

"What do you mean?" Han flared up. "Given my tragedy, this is no time for jokes. I'm furious."

Chang Ping and Song Yuanbao quickly intervened: "No need for this... Let's all calm down..."
