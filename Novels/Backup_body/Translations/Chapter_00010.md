# Chapter 10: The Invitation from Dark Flower Alley! The Rampaging Mountain Patrol Beast!  

“A letter?”  

Li Zhengjing frowned deeply.  

Before he had left for the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, his father, Marquis Jian’an, had warned him to sever all worldly ties and avoid any contact with his past.  

The capital was a place of hidden undercurrents, and the Marquis Jian’an Manor, situated there, could not remain untouched by the shifting tides. If disaster befell the family, he was to stay far away, having secretly joined the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect as their last remaining legitimate heir.  

Given that his family would never send him a letter, where had this one come from?  

Lost in thought, he opened the door to find an outer sect disciple standing outside.  

The disciple wore a complicated expression, his eyes filled with envy as he whispered, “Yingying, Yanyan, and Lanlan from Dark Flower Alley gave me ten taels of silver to deliver this letter to you.”  

Li Zhengjing stared at the letter in the disciple’s hand, momentarily stunned. Before he could speak, the disciple continued, “Dark Flower Alley is hosting the ‘Ascension Festival Banquet.’ All esteemed guests who once spent lavishly there can choose a courtesan to accompany them tonight—free of charge.”  

“…”  

Li Zhengjing was dumbfounded. Since when did such places, notorious for emptying their patrons’ pockets, offer anything for free? What kind of joke was this?  

He glanced at the golden page in his mind, where the line regarding his fortune had indeed changed:  

**Fortune: Tricked by Chen Youyu and others into descending the mountain for the night. Dies in Dark Flower Alley.**  

Suppressing his thoughts, Li Zhengjing turned his gaze back to the disciple and sneered. “What Dark Flower Alley? Who are Yingying, Yanyan, Lanlan, Miaomiao, Ruyu, or Xiaojiao? I don’t know any of them! I am a proper disciple of the Immortal Sect!”  

With a loud *bang*, he slammed the door shut, inwardly scoffing. *These outer sect supervisors have grown too complacent in their cushy positions—do they really think I’m some naive fool who’d fall for such a clumsy trap?*  

Outside, the disciple stood in confusion, muttering to himself, “This is definitely the right person. There’s only one Li Zhengjing in the outer sect. And if he doesn’t know Dark Flower Alley, how does he know it’s an unsavory place? Also… I don’t recall mentioning Miaomiao, Ruyu, or Xiaojiao just now…”  

Back in his courtyard, Li Zhengjing glanced at the letter before tossing it aside and resumed practicing the *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Roar Prison-Suppressing Technique*. Once his spiritual energy was depleted, he fetched another bowl of Five Elements Creation Paste.  

Before long, another knock came at his door.  

“I already said I don’t know any Dark Flower Alley—”  

When he opened the door, he found the fake medicine peddler standing there.  

The peddler gave him a strange look before saying, “I brought the cauldron.”  

Li Zhengjing took the cauldron and reached for his money.  

The peddler hesitated, seemingly wanting to say more.  

Li Zhengjing noticed and added an extra ten taels. “What is it?”  

The peddler lowered his voice. “It seems someone is planning to make a move against you soon.”  

Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow. “How so?”  

“The Law Enforcement Hall approached me earlier,” the peddler whispered. “They wanted me to testify that you robbed me of three cauldrons. But don’t worry—given our friendship as fellow disciples, I didn’t betray you!”  

He paused before continuing, “And they even used a Truth-Seeking Talisman to verify whether I was lying.”  

Li Zhengjing frowned. “But you haven’t cultivated internal energy yet. How did you bypass the talisman?”  

After all, the incident of him seizing the three cauldrons *had* happened. Li Zhengjing was a man of integrity and knew exactly what he had done.  

“Didn’t you tell me to act arrogant?”  

The peddler spread his hands. “I swore to the heavens that I never saw you rob me, so it worked.”  

With that, the peddler’s eyes shone with admiration. *He must have foreseen this day—his wisdom and foresight are truly on par with mine!*  

Li Zhengjing patted his shoulder in approval.  

After seeing the peddler off, he closed the courtyard gate and checked the golden page again. His fortune remained unchanged.  

Since this didn’t affect his fate, he ignored it and continued practicing the *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Roar Prison-Suppressing Technique*.  

His top priority now was to cultivate internal energy in his organs using this technique.  

As he scooped another bowl of Five Elements Creation Paste, he mused, *The* Tiger-Leopard Thunder Roar Prison-Suppressing Technique *truly lives up to its reputation as the most domineering organ-nurturing internal energy technique in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. The strain it places on the organs is immense!*  

*An ordinary disciple, even if they fully comprehended the technique and followed the correct cultivation path, would likely find their organs unable to withstand the violent process.*  

*No wonder so few elders and disciples practiced this technique in the past, leading to its near-extinction. The requirements are simply too harsh—very few possess the foundation needed to cultivate it!*  

Even with his organs healed, Li Zhengjing knew that without an endless supply of Five Elements Creation Paste, mastering this technique would be nearly impossible.  

Cultivating such a domineering technique required exceptionally strong organs—a demanding prerequisite.  

But the reward was equally great. Once mastered, the internal energy produced would be far more potent than that of other practitioners at the same level!  

Lost in thought, he didn’t realize it was already evening. The half-cut Five Elements Creation Tree, propped against the stove, looked on the verge of death.  

“Master… I can’t hold on any longer…”  

The tree weakly waved its roots, its voice feeble. “Please allow your grandson to return to the soil… just for a little while…”  

Having been severed from its upper half and left unplanted, its bark had visibly wrinkled. But fearing Li Zhengjing’s wrath, it hadn’t dared to interrupt his cultivation, trembling silently by the stove instead.  

It had hoped to request replanting once Li Zhengjing finished, but the ruthless brute turned out to be a cultivation fanatic, practicing nonstop for an entire day.  

Now at its limit, the tree swayed like a candle in the wind, seemingly on the verge of collapse.  

“Fine, go ahead.”  

“Yes, sir!”  

The tree thought gleefully, *Once I’m back in the soil, I’ll burrow away and report you to the sect leader! Let’s see how you handle that!*  

But before it could act, a burlap sack appeared before it.  

“Put this on.”  

Li Zhengjing’s voice was calm. “Bury your roots, but keep the upper half in the sack. There’s an iron chain over there—tie yourself up with it and make a dead knot. The other end will be locked to that rockery.”  

The tree fell silent for a long moment before waving its roots dejectedly. “Thank you, Master, for your kindness.”  

Li Zhengjing nodded. “We’re family now—no need for formalities. Feel free to scold or hit me if needed.”  

The tree dragged itself to the side, its countless roots digging a hole. It buried itself alongside its severed upper half, draped the sack over its head, and began refilling the hole with soil.  

Two roots wrapped the chain around the sack, tying it tightly in a dead knot.  

Then, with a final weak wave, it said, “Master, I’m done.”  

The roots burrowed into the soil, and the tree fell silent.  

Li Zhengjing secured the other end of the chain to the rockery, fetched another bowl of Five Elements Creation Paste, and resumed his cultivation.  

His organs rumbled like thunder, his blood energy surging through his body, carrying an aura akin to a descending tiger.  

*The* Tiger-Leopard Thunder Roar Prison-Suppressing Technique *is even harder to master than I expected. I’m just one step away from breaking through.*  

*Wu Yong’s cultivation notes, though meant to conceal this technique, still contain useful insights—otherwise, they wouldn’t have passed the outer sect supervisors’ review and been stored in the library.*  

*He mentioned that at the final stage, having someone stronger exert pressure could help stimulate potential, accelerating the birth of internal energy and making it even more formidable.*  

*Unfortunately, I have no backer to help me overcome this hurdle. I’ll have to rely on sheer accumulation to break through and nurture my organ’s internal energy.*  

Just as he lamented his situation, a sudden commotion erupted outside—shouts and panicked cries filled the air!  

“The mountain patrol beast has gone berserk!”  

“Move aside! That beast has awakened its bloodline power—it’s comparable to an internal energy cultivator! None of us outer sect disciples can stop it!”  

“The supervisors are here! Everyone, scatter—now!”  

**BOOM!**  

The courtyard gate exploded into splinters!  

Li Zhengjing, mid-cultivation, snapped his head toward the entrance.  

A panther with crimson eyes, its muscles bulging and blood energy surging, stood at the doorway!  

In the blink of an eye, the beast pounced—  

Fast as lightning, swift as a gale!
