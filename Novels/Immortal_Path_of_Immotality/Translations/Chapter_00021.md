# Chapter 21: Bountiful Harvest  

"Hmm? What's this?"  

Just as Lin Shan was about to search the area for antiques, he noticed a blackened object left on the altar. Before he could even examine it closely, the enhancement panel automatically appeared:  

**[Soul Wooden Fish]** (Damaged)  
**Quality:** High-grade Magical Artifact  
**Description:** Crafted from two-hundred-year-old soul wood, this auxiliary artifact gathers Yin energy, collects souls, and aids in combat.  
**Enhancement Cost:** 32 points (Cannot be enhanced in damaged state)  

"!!!"  

Lin Shan turned the broken wooden fish over in his hands. Though charred black, its surface remained smooth. Only half of it remained, with faint crackles of lightning still flickering at the broken edge, as if short-circuited.  

The enhancement panel's description of it being "damaged" was almost too generous.  

Lin Shan surmised that this wooden fish was the artifact the Black Lotus Sect elder had been using earlier—the one that had been utterly wrecked by Thunderclap's reckless assault.  

The effects were still fresh in his mind: the Yin energy in the square had swirled like a vortex, and the sound of the wooden fish had left his mind dazed even from the outskirts of the battlefield. If he had been in the thick of it, targeted by that demonic resonance, his head might have exploded on the spot!  

Yet even such a high-grade artifact had been split apart by Thunderclap's lightning technique. Just how powerful was Thunderclap?  

Lin Shan shuddered inwardly. The black-robed elder was likely the Black Lotus Sect envoy the villagers of Taoyuan Village had spoken of. With a Corpse King and a high-grade artifact at his disposal, he was clearly no ordinary figure.  

And yet, Thunderclap had captured him alive.  

Thunderclap must have been an exceptional expert even among cultivators!  

Even in its ruined state, this treasure was still an extraordinary find.  

Lin Shan happily stowed it away in his pack. So what if it couldn't be enhanced now? He could always find a way to repair it later. And if he couldn’t, he could always sell it for a fortune!  

Then another thought struck him: a high-grade artifact required 32 enhancement points.  

Lin Shan quickly did the math in his head. Enhancing an ordinary item to Postnatal level cost 2 points, Postnatal to Innate cost 4 points, and he remembered that further enhancing the Evergreen Art would require 8 points.  

By that logic, the Evergreen Art was two tiers below a high-grade artifact.  

A low-grade artifact!  

If he enhanced his ring-pommeled saber twice, raising it to the Innate level like the Evergreen Art, it would become a low-grade artifact!  

Lin Shan's heart pounded. This was a magical artifact used by cultivators!  

But he wasn’t sure—since he wasn’t a cultivator, whether he could even use such artifacts remained unknown. He had already tried channeling his true energy into the wooden fish earlier, but there had been no reaction.  

Was it because the wooden fish was broken, or was the true energy of the Evergreen Art fundamentally different from the spiritual power of cultivators?  

But if, as he had deduced, the Innate level of the Evergreen Art was equivalent to a low-grade artifact, did that mean the Evergreen Art was akin to a low-grade cultivation technique?  

Yet the Evergreen Art lacked the mystical qualities of cultivation techniques, and he had never heard of any Innate-level martial artists being considered cultivators.  

Lin Shan frowned, deep in thought. Perhaps the Innate realm was a transitional stage, existing between Postnatal martial artists and true cultivators—a unique, intermediary realm?  

"If I enhance the Evergreen Art further, could the resulting technique allow me to cultivate immortality?"  

Lin Shan’s mind raced with possibilities.  

Having witnessed cultivators in battle, Lin Shan suddenly found martial arts far less appealing.  

Why practice martial arts when you could cultivate immortality?  

His horizons had been too narrow before, but now that he had glimpsed something greater, he was determined to seize the opportunity.  

"First, I need to find ancient essence."  

---  

Amid the ruins of the square, Lin Shan scoured every inch under the faint glow of lingering ghost fires.  

After about fifteen minutes, he found an incense burner beneath a fallen stone. As expected, the enhancement panel appeared:  

**[Incense Burner]**  
**Ancient Essence:** 1 point  
**Absorb?**  

Lin Shan excitedly selected "Yes." The incense burner crumbled into sand as its essence was absorbed.  

This was the first time since the Nightingale Token that he had acquired ancient essence again. Now, with two points, he could at least enhance a divine weapon!  

Heartened, Lin Shan continued his search.  

Before long, he found another:  

**[Meditation Mat]**  
**Ancient Essence:** 1 point  
**Absorb?**  

"Absorb!"  

Soon after:  

**[Spittoon]**  
**Ancient Essence:** 1 point  
**Absorb?**  

"Ugh... fine, absorb."  

For the sake of ancient essence, he could endure it.  

Then:  

**[Chamber Pot]**  
**Ancient Essence:** 1 point  
**Absorb?**  

"???"  

Lin Shan finally understood why the five lackeys of Master Wu had entered the ancient tomb unscathed, with the Corpse King ignoring them—only to be chased when they tried to leave.  

Stealing the spittoons and chamber pots the deceased had used in life? Who wouldn’t be furious? That was just too much!  

Even the Corpse King couldn’t resist tearing open its coffin to hunt them down.  

He had no idea how those five had managed to escape. Left with no other outlet for its rage, the Corpse King had vented its fury on the next three groups of intruders.  

And because those five had spread the news far and wide, Thunderclap—who had been tracking the Black Lotus Sect—had arrived. Thus, the Black Lotus Sect envoy had met his unfortunate end.  

Lin Shan had pieced together the entire sequence of events. He silently mourned the envoy’s fate—hiding peacefully in the remote mountains, only to be undone by five grave robbers!  

---  

After thoroughly combing through the square, Lin Shan had collected over thirty antiques in total. Setting aside the useless ones, he had gained 15 points of ancient essence. Combined with the 1 point from the Nightingale Token, he now had a total of 16 points!  

Aside from the items that had turned to sand after absorption, he still had over a dozen antiques left—all valuable treasures!  

"I’m rich! Truly, fortune favors the bold!"  

After a bout of gleeful laughter, Lin Shan explored a few nearby burial chambers but found them already looted.  

What puzzled him was the absence of any Black Lotus Buddha statues.  

"The villagers of Taoyuan said the Black Lotus envoy collected statues every twenty years. Where are they?"  

Lin Shan couldn’t help but feel disappointed. Had Thunderclap taken them? Or had the envoy handed them over to higher-ups? Given his title of "envoy," there were likely superiors above him.  

But Lin Shan was almost certain that the massive ten-foot-tall Black Lotus Buddha statue purchased by the noble in the capital contained ancient essence—and a substantial amount at that!  

"I’ll reclaim it once I’m strong enough," Lin Shan vowed.  

In his mind, that statue was already destined to be his.  

---  

"But why would everyday items like spittoons and chamber pots have ancient essence?"  

How could such mundane objects be connected to cultural heritage, spiritual energy, or faith? Had his earlier deductions been wrong?  

After much contemplation, Lin Shan could only conclude that these items had absorbed traces of incense and spiritual energy from centuries of proximity to the Black Lotus statues.  

That would explain why they only yielded one or two points of ancient essence.  

"Actually, proving this wouldn’t be hard. Once I leave, I can visit an ancient temple and test the theory."  

Lin Shan felt he was gradually unraveling the mysteries of ancient essence.
