# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 94: Slaying the Fire Spirit Sect Leader  

The flames leaped and danced, white as snow. At first, they were only the size of a fist, but after Qingling Zhenren exhaled a breath of vital essence onto them, they suddenly surged upward.  

Seeing this, Lin Xuan sneered and chanted an incantation. He pointed the Hundred Souls Banner forward, and the cyan demonic flames surrounding the skull gathered together as the skull continuously exhaled yin energy into them.  

**Azureflame Demonic Fire!**  

The sky was instantly divided into two colors—azure and white. Under the glow of the demonic flames, the skull, already bathed in bloody hues, took on an additional layer of cyan, making it appear even more eerie as it howled and charged forward.  

A fierce expression flashed across the Fire Spirit Sect Leader's face. He spread his hands apart and then suddenly pushed them forward. A beam of white light and a wave of cyan radiance clashed violently.  

Booming thunder echoed continuously as azure and white flames erupted and fell from the sky like meteors. Meanwhile, the Fairy of the Clouds, her delicate face cold as frost, rapidly changed her sword seals. The Autumn Water Sword expanded yet again, doubling in size to nearly eighty feet long. Its blade shimmered with a chilling light as it pressed down inch by inch.  

The golden barrier in front of the Fire Spirit Sect Leader creaked and groaned, showing signs of collapse. Though Lin Xuan remained outwardly calm, he was inwardly elated. This Foundation Establishment expert was clearly injured and unable to unleash his full strength.  

*Strike while the iron is hot—kill him while he's weak!*  

Lin Xuan began pouring spiritual energy frantically into the Hundred Souls Banner. Then, with a flip of his hand, he took out a talisman—slightly larger than usual, with a vividly drawn bird on it.  

**Beast Talisman!**  

Qingling Zhenren's lips twisted bitterly. He was beginning to feel genuine fear at Lin Xuan's seemingly endless array of treasures and techniques.  

And this was no ordinary Beast Talisman—it contained the soul of a peak first-grade spirit beast, one that had failed to advance. Its power was nearly comparable to an early Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Lin Xuan noted the mix of shock and fury on his opponent's face. Without hesitation, he activated the Beast Talisman. If he could kill the sect leader, not only would he escape danger, but he would also gain the man's undoubtedly vast wealth.  

Under the infusion of spiritual energy, the Beast Talisman erupted with a brilliant light. A piercing cry rang out as a massive, three-eyed, one-legged monstrous bird appeared.  

As the Skysoar Bird descended upon him with overwhelming pressure, the Fire Spirit Sect Leader's face darkened. He spun rapidly in place, forming a series of intricate hand seals.  

The barrier, already on the verge of collapse under the Autumn Water Sword's assault, shattered completely when the peak spirit beast joined the attack, dissolving into motes of starlight.  

---  

The azure greatsword wasted no time, slashing down mercilessly. The Skysoar Bird opened its beak and spat out a small red spike—no more than eight inches long but radiating terrifying spiritual pressure. This was the condensed essence of the beast's soul, a weapon of immense power.  

Both attacks struck the white light simultaneously. Qin Yan's face lit up with joy, but Lin Xuan narrowed his eyes. He slapped his chest and retrieved an ink-black pearl.  

With a flick of his finger, he sent the pearl—formed within the body of a century-old zombie—flying into an empty space nearby. With a *bang*, it exploded into a dense black mist that clung stubbornly to the area, covering several meters.  

A roar of fury erupted from within the mist, followed by a burst of yellow light that dispersed the fog, revealing Qingling Zhenren.  

But the Fire Spirit Sect Leader was now in a sorry state. His face had turned an ashen gray—he had been poisoned by the zombie's miasma.  

Moments earlier, seeing his barrier about to fail, he had resorted to an extreme escape technique—**instantaneous teleportation**.  

Teleportation allowed one to move a short distance in the blink of an eye, evading even the most devastating attacks. However, it came at a steep cost: not only did it drain spiritual energy alarmingly, but each use also permanently reduced the user's cultivation. Thus, no cultivator would resort to it unless absolutely desperate.  

For a sect leader to be forced to such extremes by two Qi Condensation disciples was both humiliating and infuriating. Though unwilling to admit it, Qingling Zhenren was genuinely wary of Lin Xuan's arsenal. To avoid further complications, he decided to abandon dignity and resort to stealth.  

That a sect leader would stoop to such underhanded tactics showed just how dire his situation was—especially since his injuries already limited his strength.  

Yet once again, his plans backfired. He had used **Concealment Art**, a technique detectable only by Foundation Establishment-level spiritual sense, intending to sneak up on the two and assassinate them.  

But fate had other plans. Though Lin Xuan was only at the peak of Qi Condensation, his spiritual sense surpassed even early Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Playing along, Lin Xuan waited. Normally, one wouldn't activate a protective barrier while concealed to avoid detection. But if attacked with a spirit artifact or spell, the target would instantly raise defenses.  

So Lin Xuan chose the zombie pearl.  

The pitch-black pearl was inconspicuous, escaping Qingling Zhenren's notice. Formed within a century-old zombie, it contained potent miasmic poison. By the time the sect leader realized something was wrong, the toxin had already seeped deep into his organs.  

Though not immediately fatal for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the poison severely weakened him. Qingling Zhenren inhaled sharply, circulating his spiritual energy to suppress the toxin's spread. The tables had turned—the hunter had become the hunted.  

With a final glare of unwillingness, he attempted to flee via light遁. But Lin Xuan had no intention of letting the tiger return to the mountains. If the sect leader escaped and summoned reinforcements, Lin Xuan would be doomed.  

Immediately, he urged the Skysoar Bird forward while activating his spirit artifact. Qin Yan, thinking the same, directed the Autumn Water Sword to flank the sect leader from the other side.  

Though light遁 was fast, it couldn't outrun spirit artifacts. Soon, the Jade Snow Rings and Autumn Water Sword caught up. The rings split into sixteen identical copies, while the sword expanded into a massive azure blade once more. Together with the Skysoar Bird, they launched a three-pronged assault.  

For a moment, the air blazed with light, and deafening roars filled the sky. Qingling Zhenren, now disheveled and wild-eyed, had lost all semblance of a sect leader's dignity. In one hand, he held blazing innate flames; from his sleeve, several white beams shot forth. Though barely holding on, he refused to yield.  

Seeing this, Lin Xuan hesitated briefly before pulling out a handful of talismans. Qingling Zhenren's face paled. As a sect leader, he was wealthy, but aside from the Dao Talisman Mountain sect, few Foundation Establishment cultivators carried talismans—otherwise, he wouldn't be in such a sorry state.  

With a cold laugh, Lin Xuan activated the talismans. A dazzling array of mid-tier spells shot toward the sect leader, their combined spiritual pressure overwhelming.  

Inspired, Qin Yan also took out several talismans—some even high-tier—and, though visibly reluctant, activated them as well.  

**"NO—!"**  

Trapped within the storm of spells, Qingling Zhenren let out a final, despairing scream. The Autumn Water Sword, Jade Snow Rings, and Skysoar Bird had already pushed him to his limits—now, the barrage of spells was the last straw.  

His protective barrier shattered completely. With teleportation unusable twice in one day, the spirit artifacts, beast soul, and spells struck him mercilessly...  

---  

Moments later, the dust settled, revealing Qingling Zhenren's terrified face.  

A breeze swept past—and his body crumbled into sand, scattering into the wind until nothing remained.  

*Thud.*  

Something fell from the sky.  

Lin Xuan's eyes flickered. With a wave, he summoned a streak of cyan light to retrieve it—the Fire Spirit Sect Leader's storage pouch.  

Without a second glance—and with no intention of sharing—he tucked it into his robes.  

Then he turned to the girl beside him.  

They were fellow disciples who had just fought side by side against a common enemy. Logically, they should be allies.  

But she had seen his secrets.  

A supposed mortal with no spiritual roots, yet wielding such power, possessing spirit artifacts that belonged to others, and an arsenal of treasures.  

If these secrets got out...  

Lin Xuan's expression darkened. Just then, Qin Yan looked up, her eyes meeting his. Her delicate face was conflicted, her lips parting as if to speak—  

**BOOM!**  

The ground trembled violently. Startled, both turned toward the source—a distant mountain peak, where a golden pillar of light erupted into the heavens.  

**Author's Note:** Regarding the Fairy of the Clouds—I know many are curious about her. Rest assured, I've prepared a satisfying arc for her. Don't bother guessing—you won't see it coming! Heh.
