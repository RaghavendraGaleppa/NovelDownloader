# Chapter 32: A Chance Encounter with an Old Acquaintance

Wei Qian turned his head and indeed recognized the man, though his current state was far from well.

"Uncle Wanhai!" Li Guchen exclaimed in shock, rushing forward immediately.

The person who had called out was none other than Li Wanhai, who had stayed behind to cover their retreat that fateful day. Now, multiple wounds marred his body, including a long, diagonal scar across his face. But most shocking of all was his left hand—completely severed at the wrist.

Despite his miserable condition, Wei Qian considered him fortunate. At least he was still alive.

"Uncle Wanhai, my father—"

"Guchen, your father—"

The two began inquiring about Li Wanqing's whereabouts simultaneously.

"Ah..." Li Wanhai sighed deeply. "After holding them off that day, I barely escaped with my life but got separated from your father. Whether Brother Qing is alive or dead now, I have no idea."

"Elder Wanqing is blessed by fortune. I'm sure he's fine," Wei Qian added. "For now, let's enter the city and rest. We should find a physician to treat your injuries."

Only when Wei Qian spoke did Li Wanhai notice his presence. He scrutinized Wei Qian with sweeping glances. "You're that kid from back then! Hmph, quite lucky indeed—not even a scratch on you."

"Enough!" interrupted a black-armored guard. "Either pay the spirit stones to enter or move aside. Don't block the way for others."

Wei Qian immediately stepped forward with a storage pouch and paid two low-grade spirit stones for the severely injured Li Wanhai—though the pouch actually belonged to Li Guchen.

Originally, Wei Qian had planned to find lodging in the city before gathering information about the Li family. But now, having encountered the wounded Li Wanhai at the city gates, he changed his strategy. After entering, he promptly located a medical clinic and escorted Li Wanhai there.

Once the treatment was complete, Li Wanhai lay on the bed, holding Li Guchen's hand while repeatedly glancing at Wei Qian, clearly wanting to speak privately. Wei Qian tactfully excused himself to give them space.

The bustling street housed several clinics and a shop specializing in medicinal pills. Wei Qian entered the shop and was immediately drawn to a pill called "Qi-Replenishing Pill"—one of the two pill formulas recorded in the alchemy inheritance Lu Ping had given him.

This pill was specifically for restoring spiritual energy and was quite popular among low-level cultivators due to its affordability.

"Sir, what would you like to purchase?" a shop attendant promptly inquired.

"How much for the Qi-Replenishing Pills?" Wei Qian asked.

The answer made him suck in a sharp breath.

"Aren't Qi-Replenishing Pills supposed to be half a spirit stone for twelve pills? Why is yours one spirit stone per bottle?"

Doubling the price—was there no justice left?

The attendant remained unfazed. "Sir, you must not be aware. Our Qi-Replenishing Pills are refined using the Xiao family's secret alchemy techniques..."

The attendant rambled on, essentially claiming that their pills, produced in the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City, were of superior quality—hence the higher price.

Wei Qian didn't believe a word of it.

If the Xiao family's secret techniques had truly leaked, a Golden Core cultivator would have already arrived to silence anyone who knew. Moreover, these were just first-grade Qi-Replenishing Pills—no matter how exceptional, the price shouldn't be inflated so much.

This shop was simply exploiting the Xiao family's reputation to overcharge customers.

Wei Qian then inquired about the price of the other pill mentioned in the alchemy inheritance—the "Violet Qi Pill"—and found it was also about 30% more expensive than elsewhere.

Despite the inflated prices, customers kept streaming in. Puzzled, Wei Qian stopped one and politely asked why.

The man impatiently replied, "Can the pills sold outside guarantee quality? What if you end up with defective or even poisonous pills?"

The answer struck Wei Qian like lightning.

"No wonder the expensive pills here sell so well," he realized.

Most customers in the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City were from established families or sects—rarely rogue cultivators. For them, price was secondary; reliability was paramount.

Wei Qian, having lived as a rogue cultivator, was accustomed to prioritizing the cheapest options. But for these buyers, safety came first.

"Alchemy is such a lucrative business. The Xiao family has prospered for a thousand years—how many spirit stones have they amassed? Probably enough to form a mountain!" Wei Qian marveled.

For a fleeting moment, he entertained the thought of raiding the Xiao family's treasury—but immediately dismissed it. A mere Qi Refining cultivator plotting to rob a Golden Core clan? That wasn't ambition—it was suicide.

"A more realistic path is mastering alchemy, becoming a respected pill master, and earning wealth through hard work," Wei Qian concluded.

Back in the Misty Ridge Mountain Li family, Wei Qian hadn't been able to practice alchemy. The spiritual flames a Qi Refining cultivator could produce were insufficient for pill refinement, and the mountain lacked an earth-fire vein. The only remaining option was charcoal-fired alchemy—but the sole alchemy chamber on the mountain belonged to Li Wanqing, who had been in seclusion when Wei Qian obtained the alchemy inheritance.

"Perfect. I can test my alchemy aptitude here," Wei Qian thought. He left the shop and headed to an alchemy workshop.

"You want to rent an alchemy chamber? One low-grade spirit stone per day, plus one stone for every ten catties of beast charcoal," the attendant stated indifferently.

So expensive!

But regardless of the cost, he had to pay. Only after Wei Qian handed over the spirit stones did the attendant's attitude soften slightly.

"Proceed inside and turn left. Alchemist Ge will assign you a chamber."

Following the instructions, Wei Qian soon met Alchemist Ge—alongside a man in black robes.

"It's him!" Wei Qian's heart jolted.

The man wouldn't recognize him, but Wei Qian knew exactly who he was. The black-robed man was none other than Wang Shanyin, the newly advanced Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Blackwater Pool Wang family!

Knowing of the feud between the Li and Wang families, Wei Qian had made sure to study portraits of the Wang family's two Foundation Establishment experts. Thus, he recognized Wang Shanyin instantly.

Initially, Wei Qian felt uneasy—after all, he was affiliated with the Misty Ridge Mountain Li family. But then he realized: the Wang family's enmity was with the Li clan. What did that have to do with him? Besides, why would a Wang family elder even notice him?

Sure enough, Wang Shanyin only glanced at Wei Qian briefly upon his entry. After confirming his meager Qi Refining fifth-layer cultivation, the elder lost all interest.

"Wei Qian, right? Your chamber is Number Sixteen in the 'C' section," Alchemist Ge said, tossing him a token.

Wei Qian caught it, thanked him politely, and headed toward the chamber. As he passed the two men, however, he sensed something unusual.

Wang Shanyin's aura seemed... unstable.

Had he been injured?
