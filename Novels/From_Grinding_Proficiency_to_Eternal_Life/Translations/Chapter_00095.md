# Chapter 95: Everything is Possible

His pupils constricted violently. The vital energy and blood within him surged like boiling water, reaching its peak in an instant. His muscles bulged and rippled, veins standing out like cicada patterns. As his bones trembled, waves of force surged forth endlessly. He swung the heavy drum瓮金 hammer, weighing over two hundred catties, in a crushing arc.

The surrounding air churned, whistling incessantly.

The瓮金 hammer tore through the thick fog, its head shrouded in airflow as it smashed toward Chen Tiangang's chest.

This hammer carried enough force to shatter a bluestone tablet easily, yet it only pressed a spiderweb of blood patterns onto the opponent's skin. Those dark red veins writhed like living things, layer by layer neutralizing the hammer's force.

"That's all you've got?"

Chen Tiangang flicked the hammer face with a finger, leaving an indentation in the cast bronze head.

Xu Yunfan's expression changed drastically. Before the blood beads from his split tiger's mouth could hit the ground, he saw the blood patterns climbing up his arm along the hammer handle, weaving into semi-transparent cicada wing veins between his own blue veins.

His mind trembled, and he couldn't help but step back.

Then, he surged forward again. The瓮金 hammer rolled with a wave of air as it fell. Xu Yunfan's arm muscles bulged with cicada patterns. The two-hundred-catty steel heavy hammer turned into a black shadow, slashing straight down toward Chen Tiangang's Heavenly Spirit point.

As he spun and swung the hammer, Chen Tiangang's withered, thin palm pierced through the air. The joints of his five fingers bent backward strangely into hooks, precisely grabbing the handle seven inches from the head.

"Crack!"

The瓮金 hammer handle snapped with the sound. Blood sprayed from Xu Yunfan's tiger's mouth.

He retreated seven steps violently, his foot arches plowing deep grooves in the bluestone slabs.

Chen Tiangang's right arm muscles twisted like coiling pythons, and the bluish-black blood vessels under his skin pulsed violently. He had clearly pushed the Cicada Strength to its extreme.

"Why must you chase me?"

Xu Yunfan's back muscles knotted, resembling a ghost mask. His shoulder blades emitted a dense series of bone cracks. In his hand remained only a section of the broken瓮金 hammer handle.

The long-used drum瓮金 hammer shattered easily under Chen Tiangang's hand.

He noticed the cicada wing patterns on Chen Tiangang's newly regenerated skin were vibrating in perfect sync with the cicada wing blood threads on his own body.

"The vital energy pills you've swallowed these past few months..."

He tore open the skin on his chest. The originally dark golden true blood belonging to Ning Wuque was now forming a blood cicada swimming within his fascia.

"...were all mixed with the blood cicada medicinal power I've been nurturing for thirty years. You are the medicinal guide. If the true blood transplant encounters any issues, I will need you to assist from the side." Chen Tiangang stated confidently. "Your cultivation speed is so rapid; you must have true blood within you."

As he spoke, the blood patterns coiled on his bare upper body actually condensed into the shape of cicada wings. Every vein resembled magma flowing beneath the skin, as if it were about to explode.

"It seems there is still too much."

Chen Tiangang sighed and shook his head slightly.

"The true bloods clash, and the rejection reaction naturally disappears, but it's a pity the true blood will become a bit thinner." He looked at Xu Yunfan, revealing a hint of a smile. "Good disciple, it's just letting out some blood. I will personally bury you intact afterward."

"Master, it seems your strength has declined significantly because of this true blood."

Xu Yunfan lowered his eyelids, the muscles on his body constantly twitching.

"Naturally. In the Blood Transformation and Marrow Cleansing realms, blood is remade, marrow and bones are reborn, teeth and hair are replaced. One is reborn, blood flows like mercury, and the body is crystalline like glazed glass, free of illness or trouble. Every movement possesses the extreme power of the mortal world. One can tear through black armor with bare hands, shatter hundred-zhang boulders, and the shockwave reaches a hundred paces." Chen Tiangang's tone shifted. "However, most of my strength is used to suppress the true blood. I need time to integrate it into myself. Currently, I am barely at the Muscle Refining realm. And you, good disciple, are the guide to speed up my refinement."

"So that's how it is."

Xu Yunfan slowly raised his head and took down the iron box forged from refined steel behind him.

This scene made Chen Tiangang quite curious. "Ever since you came up the mountain, regardless of wind or rain, you've carried this iron box. What's inside? Is it perhaps a divine weapon?"

A smile appeared on Xu Yunfan's face as he opened the iron box.

"Master guessed correctly."

Chen Tiangang laughed out loud. "How could you possess one? Who holds a divine weapon, who can hold one? Do you know how strict the conditions are for a divine weapon to recognize a master? Do you think you are a supreme Qi-refining grandmaster..."

"Lin!"

Xu Yunfan formed the Lin seal with one hand. His right fingertips brushed over the black cloth. A dragon's roar suddenly erupted from the iron box.

The moment the black cloth tore, the body of the mace was cast like ancient bronze. Dark golden dragon scale patterns floated with golden silk veins. When still, it seemed as if magma was slowly writhing in the gaps of the patterns. When shaken, wisps of fire energy burst forth.

"How is this possible?!!!"

Chen Tiangang's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. He never imagined that Xu Yunfan was actually carrying a divine weapon behind his back.

"Everything is possible."

Xu Yunfan responded coldly. In the Lin state, he clearly sensed the minute air currents caused by his pores opening and closing, and the splashing of sweat droplets as they hit the ground.

Even the eighteen flickering golden silk veins on the鎏金 mace turned into a rhythm like a heartbeat.

Three breaths!

No, it should be four. His own strength had improved quite a bit these past few days.

As his thoughts turned, Xu Yunfan moved first. Under the amplification of the divine weapon, the blood energy in his body surged like thunder. The hidden power gushing forth made his bulging muscles even more exaggerated, as if they were about to split open.

With a stomp of his foot, the earth and stones beneath him churned and flew up like waves. He shot forward like a cannonball just fired, a sharp sonic boom suddenly sounding.

First breath!

The mace tip grazed past Chen Tiangang's throat. The blood energy stimulated the鎏金 mace, causing its crimson flames to surge and burn through his glazed skin. A burnt smell mixed with steam rose.

Chen Tiangang reached out to grab it but was instead blown back by the counter-shock force of the mace body, shattering the bones in his palm. His thick, mercury-like blood splattered. The surrounding grass and trees withered rapidly upon contact. His hard-body training was like paper in the face of this divine weapon.

Second breath!

Xu Yunfan spun to avoid Chen Tiangang's palm blade sweep. The tail of the mace precisely struck Chen Tiangang's lower ribs.

The sixty-six catty鎏金 mace suddenly spewed out strands of golden silk fire lines, seemingly turning into soft tendrils. Utilizing the momentum, it swung out a full moon arc of light. The fog within five zhang instantly vaporized into white mist.

Chen Tiangang's right palm, rising to grab, was still in mid-air. Xu Yunfan had already accurately predicted the three force points of his wrist bone. The鎏金 mace slanted and挑ed at the seven-inch-three mark. Amidst the sound of metal clashing, blood exploded into the sky.

Everything about the opponent was within his control.

"Wait! I have something to say!"

Chen Tiangang was terrified. He couldn't see Xu Yunfan's movements clearly at all. The opponent's strength had surged in that instant to a level he couldn't imagine.

Even holding a divine weapon, it shouldn't be like this.

It was no different from a baby holding a large club; swinging it should have been difficult. Yet Xu Yunfan wielded it smoothly, and the divine weapon even resonated actively, drawing out the potential secrets within his body, exploding to the extreme.

Xu Yunfan remained silent, merely swinging the mace repeatedly.

When the heartbeat of the third breath trembled in his chest cavity, the鎏金 mace had turned completely crimson. As bones trembled, the heavy mace emitted a trembling hum.

The moment the鎏金 mace tore through the night, the glazed skin on Chen Tiangang's throat suddenly cracked.
