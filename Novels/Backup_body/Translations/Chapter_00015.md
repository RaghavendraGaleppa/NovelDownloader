# Chapter 15: The First Trace of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord—I Use a Blade, Not a Sword!

Inside the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's inner sect grounds, Li Zhengjing used his inner sect disciple token to claim the 234th courtyard designated for inner sect disciples. He then proceeded to collect two sets of inner sect robes.

However, when the inner sect elder in charge presented him with a standard inner sect sword, Li Zhengjing clasped his hands and bowed respectfully.

"Disciple prefers using a blade."

"Hmm?" The elder was momentarily taken aback. "Though our sect does not restrict weapon choices, most disciples favor swords. There are many types—light and graceful, heavy and fierce, or sharp and lethal..."

Li Zhengjing replied solemnly, "A sword has two edges, symbolizing balance and restraint. A blade has only one, embodying pure lethality and unyielding advance. My nature is sharp and unrelenting—I will never retreat when slaying demons and monsters!"

The elder frowned slightly, displeased. "Your killing intent is too strong. As disciples of our immortal sect, we should cultivate tranquility and detachment..."

Li Zhengjing bowed again. "Elder flatters me. Elder Xie of the Enforcement Hall once praised my decisiveness in battle."

The elder's expression immediately brightened. "Ah, so you're under Old Xie's care. That changes things. Go ahead and pick a good blade for yourself."

Thanking the elder, Li Zhengjing selected a long, narrow black blade. The weapon was three feet long and three fingers wide, its edge gleaming sharply. A low-grade spirit stone was embedded at its hilt.

After fastening the blade at his waist, he entered the sect's scripture repository and glanced at the section labeled "Sword Techniques." He knew full well that the so-called *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi* manual had to be hidden there by that bastard Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, waiting for him to discover it.

*"What nonsense is this 'Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi'? I refuse to use a sword—what can you do about it?"*

Ignoring the sword techniques section entirely, Li Zhengjing strode straight to the "Blade Techniques" area. He casually picked up a manual titled *Ten Directions Stormwind Blade Art*.

Just as he was about to open it, he noticed a slight tear on the cover, through which a faint glimmer peeked—as if something extraordinary was concealed within.

Silently, he placed the manual back and sighed. "This blade art's name clearly clashes with my destiny."

He walked a few steps further, stopped before another shelf, and scanned the titles. Relieved to find an intact cover, he pulled out a manual labeled *Five Thunder Mountain-Sundering Blade Art*.

*"Perfect. This is the one!"*

As he opened the manual, a thin, translucent silk sheet slipped out, covered in densely packed characters. At the very top, the words *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi* glared back at him.

Li Zhengjing froze. He did not bend to pick it up, nor did he glance around.

*The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord is here. He's watching me.*

No matter what choice he made, the cultivation method for *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi* would inevitably appear before him. And no one would ignore such an opportunity.

He focused his mind on the golden page in his consciousness, reading the section on his fate:

**Fate:** Upon cultivating the *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi*, the sword qi's overwhelming sharpness will erupt from within, riddling your body with holes, tearing through your organs, and leaving you unrecognizable.  
**Aftermath:** Enraged, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord will dismember you, grind your bones to dust, and leave no corpse intact!

*"What if... I stubbornly refuse to cultivate this sword qi?"*

**Fate:** To confirm you are the Eternal Verdant Sacred Body, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord has prepared the supreme sword art *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi* for you.  
As a mere Inner Qi cultivator, your indifference to this peerless technique arouses his suspicion. He abandons his plans to visit the capital and focuses entirely on observing you.  
Three days later, drawing upon eight centuries of experience, he discerns the truth, extracts your soul, and searches your memories.

*"What if I use the golden page's abilities to conceal myself, making it impossible for him to see through me?"*

The golden page shifted again:

**Fate:** Three days later, despite his eight centuries of experience, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord fails to uncover your secrets. Losing patience, he extracts your soul and searches your memories.

*"So if I don't cultivate this sword qi, I'll die in three days no matter what?"*

As this realization settled, a spark of delight flickered in Li Zhengjing's eyes. He glanced around furtively, bent down to pick up the silk sheet, and discreetly tucked it into his robes, as if afraid someone might notice.

With the *Five Thunder Mountain-Sundering Blade Art* manual in hand, he went to register it with the inner sect elder, all the while thinking:

*"According to the golden page, once I obtain the sword qi, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord will leave for the capital on business."*  

That meant, for a time, the Divine Lord's gaze would no longer be fixed on him!

*"At least that's some good news."*

After completing the registration, he returned to his courtyard, retrieved the silk sheet, and studied the *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi* method.

For now, he had no choice but to begin cultivating it. Fortunately, the golden page still showed a way to alter his fate.

Focusing on the "Method to Alter Fate" section, he found it unresponsive—clearly due to insufficient spirit energy. If he could gather enough spirit stones, the method would reveal how to cultivate the sword qi without meeting a gruesome end.

*"Though the method isn't fully visible, the remaining low-grade spirit stones can provide more details..."*

Placing a spirit stone in his mouth, Li Zhengjing watched as the fate section updated:

**Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi**—the supreme sword art of the Kunlun Immortal Sect!  
Once mastered, its qi is peerlessly sharp, capable of cutting through all things. Hailed as unparalleled through the ages!  

**Prerequisite for Cultivation:** True Qi Realm.  
The True Qi Realm requires breaking through the body's acupoint barriers to release True Qi externally, achieving full acupoint circulation.  

Normally, unlocking all 365 acupoints is a painstakingly slow process. However, mastering this sword qi allows one to shatter acupoints effortlessly—ten times faster than conventional methods!  
Thus, it is revered as the supreme technique for the True Qi Realm.  

Yet, as cultivation advances, the sword qi grows increasingly lethal. If uncontrolled, it erupts from within, tearing the body apart.  
Throughout history, every cultivator of this art has died horribly, leading the Kunlun Immortal Sect to seal it away permanently.  

*"How did the supreme sword art of the foremost immortal sect end up in the hands of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord?"*  

Li Zhengjing pondered. *"This technique is peerlessly sharp, but it requires at least the True Qi Realm to practice—and even then, death is inevitable."*  

*"Yet here I am, cultivating it in the Inner Qi Realm, forging my qi into sword qi."*  

*"As my power grows, the sword qi's sharpness will damage my organs, eventually bursting out and killing me."*  

*"Only the so-called Eternal Verdant Sacred Body can continuously heal itself, allowing one to master this sword qi without perishing."*  

Remembering something urgent, he quickly planted the nearly-dead Five Elements Creation Tree in his courtyard, covering it with a sack and binding it with chains.  

Then, without further delay, he boiled a section of the tree's trunk to make Five Elements Creation Paste and began practicing the *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique* to strengthen his Inner Qi.  

When exhausted, he studied the *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi*. In his spare time, he practiced the *Five Thunder Mountain-Sundering Blade Art*.  

According to the golden page, he needed to master the sword qi before the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord returned from the capital.  

Half a month passed in a flash. Thanks to the Creation Paste, his Inner Qi grew rapidly, and his blade art showed early progress.  

Li Zhengjing channeled his Inner Qi, pressed his palm against a brick, and slowly lifted it.  

The brick had been cleanly pierced.  

*"The Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi is taking shape. Though I can't yet release it externally, my Inner Qi now carries a sharper edge, enhancing the power of my strikes."*  

*"The Inner Qi from the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique is already fierce and domineering. Refining it into sword qi makes it even deadlier."*  

*"My Inner Qi has multiplied several times over. My strength has grown significantly!"*  

He reflected, *"Half a month ago, I barely survived killing a Spirit Leopard. Now, even three or five Spirit Leopards wouldn't faze me."*  

However, as he stared at his last bowl of Creation Paste, frustration set in. Without it, his cultivation progress would slow drastically. But if he boiled more, the Five Elements Creation Tree would perish.  

Reluctantly, he divided the paste into three small vials for careful use.  

*"I must nurture this tree properly. Only by letting it grow can I continue harvesting it."*  

*"In the inner sect, merit points can be exchanged for treasures and techniques. I recall the Mystic Breath Crimson Soil for cultivating spirit plants costs twelve points."*  

The elder had previously advised him to take on the task of compiling cultivation insights, but Li Zhengjing had been too engrossed in training—sweating, toiling, and looking dashing—to bother.  

Now, to nurture the Creation Tree, he decided to visit the Assignment Hall.  

*"Compiling 'Inner Qi Realm' cultivation insights—five merit points."*  

*"Only ten slots available, and all taken."*  

*"Safe, simple tasks like this are always in high demand. No wonder the elder suggested it."*  

Having delayed for half a month, Li Zhengjing wasn't overly disappointed to find the compilation tasks already claimed. He flipped to the next page.  

All the safe assignments—writing manuals, tending spirit plants, or running errands—were taken.  

What remained were missions requiring travel outside the sect, many of them dangerous: slaying demons, retrieving specific items, or gathering rare resources.  

*"Leaving the sect is risky, but the rewards are higher."*  

Scanning the list, his eyes landed on one entry, and his brow arched.  

*"Suspected demonic activity in Wanlin County, Qixing Prefecture?"*  

A smile tugged at his lips as he glanced at the golden page. He tore out the sheet, sought the elder, and accepted the mission.  

*"Qixing Prefecture borders Bailing Prefecture."*  

Gazing beyond the sect gates, Li Zhengjing grinned.  

*"Chen Youyu... I'm coming to send you off—for good."*
