# Chapter 509: The Raging Monkey Goes Mad

This monkey was clearly insane.

Such a thing was beyond what any human could possibly do.

Even though they were green with envy at the sight of the Heavenly and Terrestrial Monarchs' qi swirling around Sun Wukong, they understood this was the True Lord's sacred grounds. To act so brazenly here would lead to a terrible end.

"Who dares to cause trouble in the Zhenyuan Temple and steal the immortal peaches!"

A clear yet furious and alarmed child's voice erupted like a thunderclap in the night.

Two short figures burst into the courtyard with the speed of a gale. It was the two Daoist boys, Qingfeng and Mingyue, who guarded the immortal peach tree.

At a glance, they saw the immortal peach tree in utter disarray, its branches and leaves torn to shreds, and the figure atop a large branch, surrounded by surging, multi-colored qi, frantically feasting.

It was none other than the three "honored guests" from the daytime: the arrogant golden-haired monkey demon, the pig, and the fierce, blue-skinned Wujing.

What made their eyes nearly pop out of their heads, however, were the peach pits and leaves scattered all over the ground. The monkey was still continuously plucking peaches and stuffing them into his mouth.

"Stop right there, you vile beasts! You... you actually dared to steal the immortal peaches! And so many of them! Put them down at once!"

Qingfeng's little face was flushed red with anger, his finger trembling as he pointed at the three on the tree.

Mingyue was so anxious he was stomping his feet. "You damned demons! Ungrateful wretches! The Temple Master treated you with such hospitality, yet you resort to such thieving deeds! Come down and surrender at once!"

Wukong already had a plan in mind and was not panicked in the slightest.

Or rather, Xu Yunfan was not panicked, which made Wukong feel as if there was nothing to worry about.

Although he felt a hint of something amiss in his heart, it was instantly washed away by the tone of the two Daoist boys, leaving him slightly displeased.

He took a big bite of an immortal peach in his hand, which was entwined with Wind and Thunder qi, causing juice to splatter everywhere. He deliberately put on a lazy, ruffian-like expression and glared at them.

"Tch! You two little brats are so unreasonable. Don't you go slinging false accusations!"

"When did I and my junior brothers ever steal anything? We're just picking a few fruits from our own garden to quench our thirst and fill our stomachs! We only just arrived this morning and haven't had a proper meal yet."

"Our bellies are aching from hunger. What's wrong with picking a few of your fruits to eat? How can you call it stealing?!"

Qingfeng was so angry he was jumping. " sophistry! Utterly shameless! You clearly intended to steal the immortal peaches! The Temple Master only gave you four. He never permitted you to pick more!"

Mingyue also roared in fury, "This is theft! It's theft! The immortal peaches are priceless. How could they be wasted by you brutish demons? You were given some this morning, and now you're back at night. What else could you be but thieves?!"

"You've already built your foundation and achieved the status of a True Person. Why would you need to eat mortal food? Why didn't the wind and dew fill your bellies and kill you?!"

Jieneng and Wujing, being scolded to their faces, felt their faces burn with embarrassment. Their hands stopped moving, and they stood on the tree, at a loss, looking at Wukong.

Wukong's heart grew even more displeased when he heard them call him a "thief," a "vile beast," and a "brutish demon." He suppressed his anger.

Standing proudly on a high branch with his golden eyes wide open and his fangs bared, he pointed at the two Daoist boys and shouted, "You little brats have some nerve! I walk a straight path and stand tall. When have I ever stolen anything?!"

"The fruits are growing on your tree. Anyone who sees them gets a share! What's wrong with me picking a few to try since I'm hungry?!"

"Furthermore," the monkey's voice suddenly rose, carrying a deliberate arrogance, "even if I ate a few more of your rotten fruits, is that a big deal? I can just pay you a few taels of silver! I've traveled one hundred and eight thousand miles to bring salvation to the entire Eastern Wasteland, to convert all the savage demons of the East into true goodness and beauty!"

"What are these worthless peaches of yours that you make such a fuss over them? And you want to tie us up to see your so-called True Lord?!"

Qingfeng and Mingyue were so enraged by his nonsensical, blame-shifting words that their seven orifices nearly smoked with fury.

Qingfeng's finger pointing at Wukong was trembling. "You... you raging monkey! You steal things and still dare to argue? What do you think you are? You dare to use the Pure Land of Bodhisattva's Zen to scare people?"

"You're nothing but a wild monkey spirit who has converted to Buddhism! Just you wait! When the True Lord, our Temple Master, returns, he'll surely flay your skin and pull out your tendons, and throw your souls into the Nine Hells' Refining Fire to turn you completely into a wisp of green smoke!"

Mingyue also cursed, "That's right! Don't you get cocky! When the Temple Master returns, he'll surely set up a heaven-net and earth-snare to capture you three beasts who can't change your demonic nature!"

"Flay my skin and pull out my tendons?"

"Refine me into a wisp of green smoke?"

"Beasts who can't change your demonic nature?"

The deliberate arrogance and wildness in Wukong's golden eyes were instantly replaced by a cold, furious rage, as if a vital scale had been touched.

Far away in the Cold Crow Pass, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but clap his hands in laughter.

"Good, very good. Let me add some more fuel to your fire."

"I was just waiting for you to say that. It's the perfect excuse."

"Primordial Sect, Pure Land of Bodhisattva's Zen, you want to sit by and watch the tussle? I'm going to smash this whole chessboard to pieces!"

"GWAAAAAAAH!"

The monkey let out a bizarre shriek, completely enraged by Qingfeng and Mingyue's words. The terrifying aura, a chaotic mix of countless Heavenly and Terrestrial Monarchs' qi, could no longer be suppressed. It erupted like a raging storm.

"You two lowly, eyeless little bastards!"

"You dare call me an unchangeable demon? And want to refine me?!"

The Ocean-Proping Golden Cudgel in his hand hummed as it burst with dazzling golden light.

A baleful fighting spirit that seemed capable of destroying heaven and earth shot straight into the sky.

Jieneng and Wujing were so scared their souls nearly fled their bodies. If Qingfeng and Mingyue were actually killed by Wukong, Wukong might get away with it thanks to his supreme skill and courage, but the two of them would be in for a world of hurt.

"Senior Brother, you can't!"

But it was too late.

A ferocious look flashed across Wukong's face. An unprovoked rage surged in his heart, burning away the last of his sanity in an instant. He let out a world-shaking roar.

"You want to curse me? Go on, curse me!"

"A single rotten peach tree! And you dare use it to bully your grandpa?!"

"Watch me snap this worthless root of yours!"

Before his words had even faded.

The Ocean-Proping Golden Cudgel, already filled with violent magical power and entwined with a chaotic mix of qi like thunder, fire, and ice, was swung in a full arc by Wukong, carrying a terrifying power that could make heaven and earth lose their color.

But it wasn't aimed at the Daoist boys.

Instead, under the horrified gazes of everyone present, it smashed down violently toward the Heavenly and Terrestrial Monarchs' Immortal Peach Tree, which glowed with flowing light and carried the essence of countless Heavenly and Terrestrial Monarchs' qi.

"CRACK!!! BOOM!!!"

The Ocean-Proping Golden Cudgel, shrouded in a chaotic storm of a thousand and ten thousand qi, slammed down with a thunderous crash.

This strike carried not only the furious demonic nature of the enraged Wukong, but also the will of Xu Yunfan's true body, who was seizing the opportunity to stir up chaos. With this added impetus, before the cudgel even touched the trunk, the tearing winds it generated had already turned all the green leaves on the tree into fine dust.

In an instant, a sudden change occurred.

The moment the Purple Gold Cudgel made contact, the immortal peach tree suddenly erupted with a blinding nine-colored radiance. Layer upon layer of Dao patterns and talismans appeared on its gnarled, dragon-like branches, revealing an incredibly powerful protective enchantment that had been laid upon it.
