# Chapter 46: Hosting an Auction

The autumn wind rustled through the emerald-green ocean of foliage on Wuling Mountain.

In the spirit fields, the Jade Crystal Rice had finally ripened, marking a bountiful harvest day.

Wei Qian, Old Man Li, and a tenant farmer couple worked their way through the fields, harvesting the Jade Crystal Rice.

Among the four, Wei Qian had the highest cultivation level. Thus, he didn't need to bend over with a sickle in hand like the others. Instead, he employed the "Golden Grass-Cutting Sword" technique, swiftly slicing down the rice stalks bearing the Jade Crystal Rice. Two mortals followed behind him, tasked with gathering the heavy stalks and loading them onto oxcarts outside.

His efficiency far surpassed the others. Before half the day had passed, he had already cleared the entire section of the spirit field assigned to him. He even had time to help Old Man Li harvest thirty acres of land, significantly reducing the old man's workload.

"Ah, time flies so quickly. In the blink of an eye, another year is about to pass," Old Man Li sighed, watching Wei Qian's effortless movements while feeling the ache in his own back. He couldn't help but mock himself, "This old man grows older year by year and is no longer of much use."

Wei Qian smiled reassuringly. "You're only eighty, still young."

Indeed, while not every Qi Refining cultivator lived to 120, barring accidents or illnesses, most could easily surpass a century of life.

"Hah, ever since I turned sixty, every year feels like a day to me. I don't even notice where the time goes—one blink, and I'm old."

Wei Qian could relate to Old Man Li's sentiment. As a dedicated cultivator who spent most of his time on the mountain, the years seemed to slip by unnoticed. Still, staying on the mountain wasn't bad—at least it was much safer.

The outside world had grown increasingly chaotic over the past year. Just last month, Bai Fugui had brought Wei Qian startling news: among the new demonic cultivators in Yunzhou, someone had actually achieved Foundation Establishment!

The man had originally been a wanted bandit, lurking around the Black Flood Dragon Immortal City, robbing and killing countless rogue cultivators and clan disciples, his hands stained with blood. The Black Flood Dragon Immortal City had once dispatched a team to hunt him down, severely wounding him and forcing him to flee deep into the Demon Beast Mountains, where he vanished without a trace.

Everyone assumed he had died, likely devoured by some demonic beast. But not long ago, he reappeared near the Black Flood Dragon Immortal City, slaughtering an entire merchant convoy in an exceptionally gruesome massacre. Most terrifying of all, he had somehow obtained an extraordinary opportunity, cultivating demonic arts and breaking through to Foundation Establishment!

Rumors said even the lord of Black Flood Dragon Immortal City, the Black Flood Dragon True Person, had been alarmed, sending Core Formation cultivators to scour the area and eliminate the threat once and for all.

Thinking of this, Wei Qian couldn't help but frown. "What exactly has the Flowing Cloud Sect's enforcement team accomplished? After a year of suppressing demonic cultivators, their influence has only grown more rampant."

If demonic cultivators could reach Foundation Establishment after just one year of suppression, what would happen after eight or ten years? Would they start forming Golden Cores? Incompetent! That was Wei Qian's assessment of the righteous factions in Yunzhou.

Thus, he grew even more determined to remain safely on Wuling Mountain. Cherishing one's life was no bad thing!

And so, another peaceful year passed for Wei Qian on the mountain. He was now twenty-eight years old, still at the sixth level of Qi Refinement. However, his year of relentless cultivation had deepened his foundation at this stage. By his estimation, he would break through to the seventh level in another two years.

During this time, Wei Qian had also used the Dragon Pearl's wish-granting ability to forcibly elevate his spiritual farming skills to the upper first-grade level, surpassing Old Man Li's lifelong achievements! The reason was simple: Li Wanqing had entrusted the spirit herb garden to him.

Of course, "entrusted" might not be the most accurate term—more precisely, he was asked to manage it temporarily. Becoming the garden's caretaker didn't mean Wei Qian could embezzle its resources. For one, he wasn't that kind of person. Secondly, Li Wanqing wasn't foolish—he visited the garden almost daily to inspect it. His concern wasn't theft but rather Wei Qian's inexperience; if a few precious herbs, such as those used to refine Purple Qi Pills or Purple Mist Pills, were to die under his care, the losses would be substantial.

But Wei Qian's performance had pleasantly surprised Li Wanqing. Once, Li Wanqing even remarked wistfully, "Why couldn't you have been my son?" From then on, he took an increasing interest in arranging Wei Qian's marriage, practically asking outright, "Xiao Wei, do you want a wife?"

"What reason is there to refuse?" Wei Qian mused, massaging his temples as he pondered.

A paper crane messenger fluttered down before him, interrupting his thoughts. The sender was Bai Fugui, inviting him down the mountain for an important discussion.

"Something big? Did a demonic cultivator actually form a Golden Core?" The thought startled Wei Qian—he feared his words might jinx the situation. A demonic cultivator reaching Core Formation would undoubtedly have countless lives on their hands. In Wei Qian's past life, such individuals would have been recorded in history books as infamous tyrants.

One miscellaneous text he'd read described a distant land where a Nascent Soul-stage demonic cultivator had sacrificed an entire cultivation nation to break through to a higher realm. What was once a thriving kingdom became a lifeless wasteland.

"My mouth isn't that prophetic," Wei Qian reassured himself as he descended the mountain to meet Bai Fugui.

To his relief, his words hadn't manifested reality. Bai Fugui wanted to discuss hosting an auction—not inviting Wei Qian to attend one, but to co-organize it.

"To host an auction, you'd need attractive items. Did you find some treasure?" Wei Qian raised an eyebrow.

Bai Fugui grinned. "I've gathered three or four fellow cultivators, each contributing a few items. We'll also accept consignments from rogue cultivators—that should be enough to set up a small auction." Sensing hesitation, he added, "Auctions are great for earning spirit stones. Plus, if something good appears, we might even snag a bargain ourselves."

"Hosting an auction..." Wei Qian pondered. "When and where do you plan to hold it?"

Bai Fugui perked up—Wei Qian's question signaled interest! "Since it's an auction, we should prepare properly. I plan to reach out to more people. Tentatively, we'll hold it two months from now on the island at the center of Pingyang Lake."

Wei Qian fell silent for a moment before replying, "Let me think it over. I'll give you an answer tomorrow."
