# Chapter 10: Lin Qiuying  

Mu Sen greatly admired people with such pure hearts.  

"Junior Brother Zhang, you probably don't own any magical artifacts yet, do you?"  

"Well..."  

"I haven't been in the sect for long and haven't had the time or spirit stones to acquire any," Zhang Yan admitted frankly, explaining his current situation.  

"Your cultivation level is still too low. Even if I gave you a high-grade magical artifact, you likely wouldn't have enough spiritual power to activate it. Here, I'll gift you these few artifacts—they should suffice for now."  

After a moment of contemplation, Mu Sen waved his hand.  

Instantly, several magical artifacts appeared in the air.  

A flying sword crafted from jade bamboo.  

A greenwood boat.  

And finally, something resembling a whisk.  

"This flying sword is a mid-grade artifact. When paired with wood-attribute techniques, its power is quite formidable—enough to serve you until the late Qi Refining stage."  

"As for this greenwood boat, it's a high-grade artifact. I noticed you don’t have a flying artifact for travel—that won’t do. This boat can be powered by spirit stones, so even someone at your current level can use it."  

"Lastly, this Serene Rain Whisk is a low-grade artifact, but it’s a rare auxiliary tool. When used, it can summon spiritual rain to nourish spirit plants and increase their yield."  

"Junior Brother Zhang, are you satisfied with these three artifacts?"  

Mu Sen smiled warmly as he looked at Zhang Yan.  

Gazing at the three radiant artifacts, Zhang Yan felt his breath hitch.  

This was far too generous!  

"Senior Brother Mu, you... this is too much!"  

Three artifacts!  

And not just any ordinary ones at that.  

If sold in the market, they could easily fetch 2,000 spirit stones.  

After all, flying swords were inherently more expensive than regular artifacts.  

The greenwood boat, as a flying artifact, was also among the pricier options.  

And as for the Serene Rain Whisk—its value to a spirit planter needed no explanation.  

But most importantly—the attributes on these artifacts!  

Among these three pieces of equipment, there were...  

Yet now, Mu Sen was simply giving them away!  

"Hahaha, Junior Brother Zhang, just accept them. These items are of no use to me anymore, and I have no descendants or disciples to pass them on to. Giving them to you is fitting." Mu Sen shook his head, recalling the time when he had just entered Qi Refining and his senior brother had gifted him artifacts.  

Who would have thought that in the blink of an eye, he would be the one bestowing artifacts upon others?  

"In that case, I thank you, Senior Brother." Zhang Yan bowed deeply once more, gazing at the artifacts before him.  

"Mm. I’ll also give you the seeds for the Spirit-Devouring Flower and other spirit plants."  

---  

"However, Junior Brother Zhang, I must remind you—you’re still young. The most important thing right now is your own cultivation. Don’t let techniques distract you from your progress, or you’ll gain little and lose much." Mu Sen spoke sternly, offering his advice.  

"Yes, Senior Brother!"  

Zhang Yan naturally took Mu Sen’s words to heart and gratefully accepted the gifts.  

"By the way, once you’ve mastered the Wood Origin Technique to the Grandmaster level, come find me. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can ask me anytime."  

"Understood, Senior Brother Mu."  

Their identity jade tokens allowed them to communicate, somewhat like text messages from his past life—except without any fees.  

Extremely convenient!  

After settling these matters, Mu Sen dismissed Zhang Yan.  

As he put it, the lectures he was currently giving covered only the basics—things that were of no use to Zhang Yan at this stage.  

Rather than wasting time sitting through them, it was better for Zhang Yan to return and study on his own, asking questions whenever he encountered difficulties.  

---  

After leaving Enlightenment Peak, Zhang Yan carefully retrieved the three artifacts and began inspecting their attributes.  

The whole reason he had wanted secondhand artifacts was precisely for these attributes!  

Earlier, with Mu Sen so close, he hadn’t dared to examine them in detail.  

Now, he finally had the time.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Golden Bamboo Sword  
**[Equipment Grade]**: Green  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- Sharpness (Weapon Sharpness +2)  
- Sword Qi (Can unleash sword energy)  
- Sword Control Technique (Grandmaster)  
- Spirit Sword Art (Grandmaster)  

...  

**[Equipment Name]**: Greenwood Boat  
**[Equipment Grade]**: Green  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- Extreme Speed (Speed +2)  
- Masterful Piloting (With the same flying artifact, you’ll always be faster than others! Only an expert can squeeze every last drop of performance from a flying artifact!)  

...  

**[Equipment Name]**: Serene Rain Whisk  
**[Equipment Grade]**: Blue  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- Spiritual Rain Technique (Perfection)  

"Tsk—"  

Zhang Yan couldn’t help but inhale sharply.  

Two green-grade artifacts and one blue-grade artifact!  

"It seems the quality of an artifact isn’t solely determined by its level."  

The fact that the lower-grade artifact had a higher quality than the higher-grade ones was unexpected.  

But he quickly understood.  

The equipment panel likely determined an artifact’s quality based on two factors:  

1. Its attributes.  
2. The artifact’s inherent quality.  

The Serene Rain Whisk might only be a low-grade artifact, but...  

It had a Perfection-level attribute!  

"With the Spiritual Rain Technique, my spirit plants will grow even faster." Spirit planting was his foundation—he would never abandon it.  

"And..."  

"Who would’ve thought Senior Brother Mu, who seems so stern, is actually a speed demon!"  

Zhang Yan suddenly recalled the attribute on the greenwood boat:  

**Masterful Piloting**!  

It was hard to imagine just how much practice Mu Sen had put in to earn such an attribute from the equipment panel.  

"Speaking of which... should I try flying the boat?"  

For a moment, Zhang Yan was tempted to take the boat for a spin.  

But he quickly dismissed the idea.  

His cultivation was still too weak—only Qi Refining Stage, Layer One.  

The greenwood boat was a high-grade artifact—far too conspicuous.  

As the saying went, *don’t flash your wealth*.  

Better to wait for a chance to try it out alone later.  

With that in mind, he walked back to the spirit plantation on foot.  

---  

The moment he arrived, Zhang Yan froze.  

Because standing in the spirit plantation was a female cultivator.  

She appeared to be around twenty years old, with fair skin and a cold, aloof expression—someone who didn’t seem easy to get along with.  

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Zhang, you’re back?"  

Hearing the noise outside, Old Lin stepped out of the house. When he saw Zhang Yan, his eyes lit up.  

"This is my daughter, Lin Qiuying—an inner disciple of our sect. Since you two are close in age, you should get to know each other."  

Old Lin’s smile was radiant, his tone and expression carrying an unmistakable matchmaking vibe.  

Zhang Yan, however, was speechless.  

Among cultivators, age gaps of a dozen or even several dozen years were common.  

But the problem was—his current body was only fourteen years old!  

Meanwhile, Lin Qiuying was already twenty!  

This... was just not appropriate!
