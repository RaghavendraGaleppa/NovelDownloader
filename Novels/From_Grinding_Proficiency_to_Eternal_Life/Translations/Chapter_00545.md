# Chapter 545: Make Up for It First

Most importantly, it points directly to one of the most fundamental forces in the universe: Yin and Yang.

This true scripture expounds on the great Dao of Yin and Yang mutually generating and restraining each other, as well as uniting and separating.

The core lies in constructing a perfectly balanced, self-circulating "Inner Scenery Heaven and Earth" or "Yin and Yang Chaos" within the practitioner's body.

This Inner Scenery Heaven and Earth serves as both a solid fortress and a hub for controlling Yin and Yang, allowing one to engage with the cycles of union and separation between heaven and earth.

It appears as Yin and Yang on the outside, but contains domineering power within.

Based on this foundation, this cultivation technique derives many marvelous uses.

It is not merely about plundering; it places greater emphasis on transformation and domination.

One's own Inner Scenery Heaven and Earth is like a miniature "Heaven and Earth Crucible." It can not only digest the vital energy plundered from the outside—including but not limited to the primordial essence of a Cauldron—but also draw upon the scattered Yin and Yang energies of heaven and earth, the essence of the sun and moon, and even the heavenly and earthly essences of specific spiritual veins and terrestrial evil spirits, to perform "assimilation" and "sublimation," transforming them completely into pure spiritual power to nourish the Inner Scenery Heaven and Earth and one's own Dao Foundation.

In the words of the Primordial Origin Sect, this is stealing the opportunities of heaven.

After cultivating it to perfection, one pursues a state of "Yin and Yang resonance," and under this realm, forcibly plunders heaven and earth for one's own use.

This true scripture fully expounds the way of man: to make up for what is lacking by taking from heaven and earth.

What a fine saying: "All things can be a cauldron."

Xu Yunfan's mind became clear.

The auxiliary plundering ability of the *True Scripture of the Mutual Conquest of Heaven and Earth and the Union-Separation of Yin and Yang* was precisely the best supporting cultivation technique he currently needed.

If he could cultivate it to perfection, even if he didn't use it to condense his Dao Foundation, the effect of forcefully plundering heaven and earth for his own use would already be worth the price.

It would be enough to support his rapid advancement from the mid to late Foundation Establishment stage, tempering his foundation to become even stronger.

Not to mention the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, the Yin and Yang Union-Separation True Lord and the Divine Thunder True Scripture alone could form a perfect complement.

After all, the various Divine Thunder techniques recorded in the Divine Thunder True Scripture consume vast amounts of spiritual power. With the True Scripture of Union-Separation of Yin and Yang to replenish it, he could achieve a state of infinite mana recovery.

不知过了多久，信息传输终于结束。
After some time, the transmission of information finally ended.

柳蕴华如同被抽干了所有力气和精神，彻底瘫软在地，眼神涣散，脸色苍白如纸，神魂损耗巨大。
Liu Yunhua seemed to have all her strength and spirit drained away. She collapsed completely on the ground, her eyes unfocused, her face as pale as paper, her soul suffering immense damage.

徐云帆缓缓睁开双眼。
Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes.

‘你尝试修行天地交征阴阳离合真经，似乎领悟了些许道理’
'You attempted to cultivate the True Scripture of the Mutual Conquest of Heaven and Earth and the Union-Separation of Yin and Yang, and seem to have grasped a hint of its principles.'

很好，属性面板提示的信息并没有残缺，也就意味着柳蕴华给出的真经乃是完整的。
Very good. The information prompted by the attribute panel was not incomplete, which meant the true scripture given by Liu Yunhua was complete.

柳蕴华哀怨几声，却也不敢多说什么，形势比人强，如今作为阶下囚，只盼徐云帆还忌惮元始宗门规。
Liu Yunhua let out a few mournful sounds but didn't dare to say anything more. The situation was stronger than the individual. Now that she was a prisoner, she could only hope that Xu Yunfan still feared the rules of the Primordial Origin Sect.

虽然元始宗内个个都是人材，但筑基真人终究算得上中流砥柱，一宗之内至多二十几位，算上轮回转世的，待在元始宗的筑基真人怕是还要少一些。
Although everyone in the Primordial Origin Sect was a talent, Foundation Establishment True Persons were still considered the mainstay. There were at most two dozen or so in the entire sect. Counting those in the cycle of reincarnation, the number of Foundation Establishment True Persons actually staying in the Primordial Origin Sect was probably even fewer.

如此，倒是也不好再强行逼迫柳蕴华什么，至少，不能害对方性命。
In that case, it wasn't really appropriate to force Liu Yunhua any further. At the very least, he couldn't take her life.

起码在自己没有切断因果的天机至宝之前，宗内杀筑基真人定然会被真君察觉。
At least, before he had a heaven-defying treasure that could sever karmic connections, killing a Foundation Establishment True Person within the sect would definitely be detected by a True Lord.

“很好。”
"Very good."

徐云帆点点头，声音平淡，算是认可了柳蕴华的合作态度。
Xu Yunfan nodded, his voice calm, acknowledging Liu Yunhua's cooperative attitude.

这也意味着他暂时遵守了誓言，暂时不会取她性命。
This also meant he was temporarily abiding by his oath and would not take her life for now.

柳蕴华大大松了口气，虚弱地喘息着，仿佛刚从地狱走了一遭。
Liu Yunhua let out a huge sigh of relief, breathing weakly as if she had just returned from the gates of hell.

然而，这口气还未喘匀，徐云帆接下来的动作又让她的心提到了嗓子眼。
However, before she could even catch her breath, Xu Yunfan's next action made her heart leap into her throat.

只见徐云帆目光转向她，那刚刚收敛的冰冷再次隐隐浮现。
It was seen that Xu Yunfan's gaze turned towards her, the coldness that had just receded now faintly reappearing.

“誓言是留你一命。”
"The oath was to spare your life."

徐云帆缓缓道，“但师姐方才试图将我当做鼎炉算计，甚至不惜派出‘先天情欲道体’的弟子。”
Xu Yunfan said slowly, "But Senior Sister just attempted to scheme against me as a cauldron, even going so far as to send out a disciple with a '先天情欲道体' (Innate Path Body of Passion and Desire)."

说这话时，他瞥了一眼蒲玉，转而笑意盈盈道：“……这代价，总不能白白承受。”
As he said this, he glanced at Pu Yu, then said with a smile, "...This price cannot be borne for nothing."

言下之意很明显，那就是让柳蕴华放开身子当做他的鼎炉，他自然是不能吃亏的。
The implication was very clear: he wanted Liu Yunhua to offer her body as his cauldron. He certainly wasn't going to suffer a loss.

柳蕴华脸上挤出笑容，心头自然明白，一副任君采摘的模样，就算不用魅术，依旧风情万种。
Liu Yunhua forced a smile on her face, understanding clearly in her heart. She adopted a posture of being at his disposal. Even without using her charm technique, she was still full of allure.

徐云帆自然不会善罢甘休……
Xu Yunfan certainly wouldn't let things go...

说话间，磅礴的神念再次笼罩柳蕴华。
As he spoke, his immense spiritual sense once again enveloped Liu Yunhua.

但这一次，不再是试图吞噬，而是运转起了脑海中刚刚理解属于《天地交征阴阳离合真经》的精义。
But this time, it wasn't an attempt to devour, but rather to activate the essence of the *True Scripture of the Mutual Conquest of Heaven and Earth and the Union-Separation of Yin and Yang* that he had just understood in his mind.

他无法瞬间学会构建完整内景，但他可以尝试引动掠夺的法门。
He couldn't instantly learn to construct a complete Inner Scenery, but he could attempt to invoke the methods of plundering.

徐云帆凭借自身更强大的修为，更凝练的洞天以及真经的指引，如同掌握了一把精确的钥匙。
Relying on his own superior cultivation, his more condensed Heavenly Cave, and the guidance of the true scripture, Xu Yunfan was like one holding a precise key.

那原本坚不可摧的壁垒，在徐云帆神念的感知下，清晰地露出了运转的轨迹和气机节点。
The originally unbreakable barrier, under the perception of Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense, clearly revealed its operational trajectory and nodes of vital energy.

更重要的是，柳蕴华不敢反抗。
More importantly, Liu Yunhua didn't dare to resist.

“开！”
"Open!"

无声的意念波动中，一股蕴含徐云帆意志的法力刺入柳蕴华体内。
In a silent ripple of thought, a wisp of spiritual power containing Xu Yunfan's will pierced into Liu Yunhua's body.

开玩笑，这娘们儿心思对他狠，他自然不会怜香惜玉。
Just kidding, this woman's heart was cruel to him. He certainly wouldn't show any mercy.

“呃啊！！”
"Argh!!!"

柳蕴华惨呼出声，声音凄厉扭曲，再无半点风情。
Liu Yunhua let out a miserable cry, her voice sharp and distorted, with not a trace of charm left.

那是一种本源被强行撕裂的痛苦，远比肉体创伤更甚百倍。
It was a pain of her origin being forcibly torn apart, a hundred times worse than any physical injury.

她体内那自成循环，稳固如山的阴阳内景，在徐云帆更加强横蛮横的力量入侵下，暴露出了最柔软的核心。
The self-circulating, mountain-stable Yin and Yang Inner Scenery within her body, under the invasion of Xu Yunfan's more overbearing and tyrannical power, exposed its softest core.

徐云帆清晰地感觉到，自己的法力总量在以肉眼可见的速度增长，凝练。
Xu Yunfan clearly felt that the total amount of his spiritual power was increasing and condensing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

那形成的洞天雏形虚影，更是在气海丹田中微微震颤，以一种几乎贪婪的姿态汲取着这纯粹的“养分”，甚至虚影似乎都凝实了一丝。
The nascent shadow of his Heavenly Cave trembled slightly in his Qi Sea Dantian, greedily absorbing this pure "nourishment," to the point that the shadow seemed to become a bit more solid.

（今日容在下休息一下，谢谢大家！）
