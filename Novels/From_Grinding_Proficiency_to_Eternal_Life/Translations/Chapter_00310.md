# Chapter 310: Journey to Yujing

Bi Yuan waved his hand dismissively. "We'll put that matter aside for now."

"In three days, we set out. Li Haomiao's identity will be perfectly legitimate by then. You are to assist him when the time comes. Exercise utmost caution in all matters. Preserving your life is paramount; everything else is trivial."

Bi Yuan's expression was grave. This was a test for Xu Yunfan, yet he dared not show the slightest carelessness. If Xu Yunfan were to truly fall in the Yujing Dao, Bi Yuan would have nowhere to shed tears.

Xu Yunfan nodded heavily. "Understood, Master!"

Bi Yuan suddenly pressed a scroll firmly into Xu Yunfan's palm.

"The Great Zhou Imperial Examinations are in the midst of their triennial grand selection. The Yujing Dao has not yet terminated its proceedings. You may use the opportunity of the Grand Martial Assembly to openly compete for the title of Grand Champion, while secretly accomplishing three crucial tasks..."

A sharp glint flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes, and he instantly grasped the deeper meaning behind Bi Yuan's words.

Yujing Dao stood at the pinnacle of the Great Zhou's Six Dao, its core, Yujing City, was the center of imperial power for a millennium, a land where nine dragons coiled, and the world's spiritual fortune converged like a hundred rivers returning to the sea.

Within the majestic imperial palace, the radiance of the Purple Star shone day and night. The Vermilion Bird Avenue ran from north to south, and the seventy-two market districts corresponded to the number of celestial stars. This formidable city, which carried the destiny of the Great Zhou, was now gradually shrouded in a heavy twilight.

The Empress, who once suppressed all directions with an iron fist, was now in her twilight years.

On the dragon bed deep within the palace, the Empress's withered fingers still tightly gripped the Imperial Seal, yet her increasingly feeble breath could not hide her underlying foundation. The backlash from the blood sacrifice of her subjects was gradually leading her to a tragic end.

Hidden within the submitted memorials were glints of blades, and within the court councils of the Nine Ministers, shadows of swords appeared. Even the rustling of the Imperial Guard's armor carried an air of strangeness.

All factions, like jackals smelling blood, were on the move. The salt merchants of Jiangnan Dao secretly formed alliances, the iron cavalry of Yanbei Dao patrolled the borders, and even the alchemists from the overseas islands sent envoys.

Although the various Dao and provinces maintained a facade of submission on the surface, they were in fact already divided and ruled by warlords. The Sect Master of Jiannan Dao pointed his sword at Yujing, the Han and Hu coalition forces of Yanbei Dao sharpened their weapons, and the master forgers of the Baolian Manor in Qingzhou worked day and night to forge weapons.

Everyone knew that whoever could make the first move in this grand game within Yujing City would hold the key to the tripod-like balance of power that would divide the realm.

Although Jiannan Dao was separated from Yujing Dao by Jiangnan Dao, its northwestern end bordered Yujing Dao, making it the perfect springboard for the Sect Master to intervene in Yujing!

***

Yujing Dao, Yujing Prefecture, Yujing City. Deep within the Great Zhou Imperial Court, in the Purple Extremum Hall.

The candlelight within the hall flickered, but it could not dispel the heavy sense of twilight.

The lacquer on the gilded, coiled dragon pillars had long since become mottled, and the black curtains hanging from the dome moved without wind, as if manipulated by an unseen hand.

The Empress reclined against the dragon bed. A bright yellow dragon robe hung loosely over her枯木-like, withered body. The skin on her exposed wrists was as wrinkled as tree bark, and blue-purple veins twisted and wound beneath her pale skin.

Her eyelids drooped half-closed, her eye sockets were deep-set, but her turbid pupils occasionally flashed with a startling golden light. The unique sign of a Ninth-Rank Qi Refining Grandmaster, "Inner Concealment of the Divine Treasure," revealed that this aging Empress was like a dormant volcano of molten rock, ready to erupt at any moment.

"Your Majesty, this year's Imperial Examinations have proceeded as scheduled and the results have been posted."

Pei Jian, the Vice Minister of Rites in charge of the examinations, prostrated himself below the jade steps, his forehead pressed tightly against the cold green jade tiles. His voice was strained, and his back was already soaked in cold sweat. This capable official, hailing from the Pei clan of Hedong in Yujing Dao, at this moment did not even have the courage to lift his head and look upon the imperial countenance.

A meaningless chuckle rumbled from the Empress's throat. Her thin, bony fingers slowly tapped on the armrest, her nails striking the agarwood wood, creating a hollow "tap, tap" sound. This sound was particularly jarring in the deathly stillness of the great hall. Guo Lang, the Director of the Imperial Observatory standing to the side, had an almost imperceptible tremble in his sleeves.

"The Imperial Examinations..."

The Empress finally spoke, her voice hoarse like sandpaper rubbing. "Good, good."

She paused for a long time after each word, as if squeezing the sound from her lungs. "This time... there should be quite a few interesting ones."

Cao An, the chief eunuch standing by, bowed and stepped forward. He scooped a spoonful of medicinal liquid from a琉璃盏 (crystal cup) with a silver spoon and carefully brought it to the Empress's lips. The liquid was crimson as blood, with a strange golden mist floating on its surface.

The Empress suddenly raised her hand and knocked the cup away. Cao An immediately knelt and kowtowed repeatedly, the corner of his forehead striking the steps and drawing blood, yet he dared not wipe it.

"I am not yet at the point where I need you to feed me!" the Empress suddenly roared, sitting bolt upright. A series of "cracking" sounds of bones misaligning erupted from beneath her dragon robe. The golden light in her deep-set eye sockets blazed, and the air in the entire Purple Extremum Hall instantly solidified. Pei Jian and Guo Lang's robes billowed without wind, as if they were forced to slide back half a foot by an invisible pressure.

But this imposing aura lasted only for a brief moment. The Empress began to cough violently, spitting black blood that stained the front of her dragon robe, like blooming ink-plum blossoms. Cao An scrambled to bring a golden basin to catch the bloody froth, and a foul-smelling white smoke immediately rose from the basin. The blood actually corroded the golden basin, making a "sizzling" sound.

After the failure of the blood sacrifice that day, the Heavenly Sword, Dugu Nine, had suddenly emerged and fought her fiercely, leaving her with severe injuries.

The Empress could not help but recall the day Dugu Nine had swung his sword at her, and ripples still stirred in her heart.

The moment the blood sacrifice formation collapsed, a hundred-zhang-long sword scar suddenly exploded over Yujing City. Dugu Nine stood in the air, his gray-white long hair writhing like wild snakes, and from his decaying body erupted a sword intent that could make mountains and rivers tremble. This world-shaking battle seemed to end with the Heavenly Sword's defeat, but it forced the already dying Empress to consume even more of the nation's fortune to suppress the rampaging sword energy within her.

The destiny of the Great Zhou, under her constant exploitation, had already reached its end. If she could not use this opportunity to rekindle her vitality...

"Your Majesty, please take care of your sacred body!" Guo Lang suddenly kowtowed heavily, his official hat made of meteoric iron striking sparks on the tile. "Your humble minister observed the stars last night. Although the Purple Forbidden Enclosure is dim, a strange star has suddenly risen in the Heavenly Market Enclosure, which corresponds precisely to this Imperial Examination..."

The Empress wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth with her sleeve and suddenly grinned. Her missing teeth were a grayish-green, while her gums were a诡异鲜红 like cinnabar. "Minister Guo is still so glib with your words."

She slowly leaned back against the dragon bed, her fingers unconsciously stroking a peculiarly shaped short staff by the side of the bed. It was a秘宝 (secret treasure) crafted from the spine of some kind of demonic beast, and the gemstone shaped like an eyeball on its head turned slightly with her movements.

After the复苏 of the world's spiritual energy, qi rose from the earth's veins. Though thin, it finally gave reactions to several old artifacts within the Great Zhou Imperial Court.

"You truly think I have become a muddled old woman? Those who have come to take the examination..."

She suddenly began to gasp heavily, a rattling sound like a broken bellows coming from her chest. "The salt smugglers of Jiangnan Dao, the bandits of Yanbei Dao, the forgers of the Baolian Manor in Qingzhou... Cough, cough... even those barbarians from the South Sea islands have sent people!"

Pei Jian's official robe was soaked at the hem. He naturally knew how absurd the list of candidates for this examination was. The "scholars" from Jiannan Dao had thick calluses on their hands, the "students" from Yanbei Dao carried the unique muttony scent of the grasslands, and that was not even mentioning the martial artists who had come with forged travel permits.
