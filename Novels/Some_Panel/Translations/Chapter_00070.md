Chapter Sixty-Nine: Underwater Waterfall, Obtaining the Legacy

The Golden Core finally formed.

Yang Ji looked at himself at this moment.

[Name: Yang Ji]
[Root Bone: Medium]
[Lifespan: 63/500]
[Realm: Early Golden Core [One-Mark Golden Core] (0/1536000)]
[Cultivation Methods: Ling Shui Art (Low-grade), True Adamant Divine Art (Dao-grade)]
[Great Divine Ability: Humanoid Weapon [Volume One] (Great Accomplishment)]
[Great Divine Ability: Universal Shift (Minor Accomplishment)]
[Great Divine Ability: Gui Zang Sword Art [Li Sword Dao (Minor Sword Soul)], [Zhen Sword Dao (Minor Sword Soul)], [Xun Sword Dao (Minor Sword Soul)], [Dui Sword Dao (Minor Sword Soul)]
[Spells: Following Water Sword Art (Perfection), Light Body Art (Perfection)]

Yang Ji was a little dumbfounded seeing the cultivation points required for his next realm. Indeed, as Li Changxiao said, for the Nine-Mark Golden Core, each breakthrough requires all the cultivation of the entire Foundation Establishment realm. At his current cultivation speed of 120 cultivation points per day, reaching a Nine-Mark Golden Core would take over three hundred years, consuming most of his lifespan. This cultivation speed was far inferior to Li Changxiao's back then. This was the gap between medium-grade root bones and supreme-grade root bones. Given this, how fast must the cultivation speed of Spirit Bodies and Sacred Bodies be?

However, after reaching the Void Refinement realm, while cultivation is important, comprehension of the Dao is equally crucial. Once one encounters a Dao bottleneck, even if one has accumulated enough cultivation to break through, if their comprehension of the Dao is insufficient, there's no way around it; they still cannot break through. If Yang Ji wanted to overtake others, it would only be possible after entering the Void Refinement realm. Before that, it was simply out of the question. Thinking that he still needed over three hundred years of arduous cultivation to break through to the peak of Golden Core, he couldn't help but feel a headache.

However, the joy of breaking through to the Golden Core realm diluted much of his frustration. What also pleased him was the Humanoid Weapon. After nearly thirty years of arduous cultivation, Volume One of the Humanoid Weapon was finally close to reaching the Perfection realm. This body-refining cultivation method was unlike other great divine abilities. The reason for its slow cultivation was that it not only required comprehension but also gradual tempering and transformation of the body. This kind of cultivation was quite different from comprehending the profound mysteries of other great divine abilities. Once Volume One of the Humanoid Weapon reached the Perfection realm, he would be qualified to go to the underwater waterfall to obtain the legacy of Senior Fu Dongliu. At that time, he would gain another profound foundation for striking towards the path of immortality. Thinking of this, a brilliant smile couldn't help but appear on Yang Ji's face. After briefly experiencing the profound mysteries of the Golden Core realm, he immediately began cultivating, racing against time.

Three more years passed in a flash.

On this day, Yang Ji, resembling a Vajra from the Buddhist Sect, emitted a golden light from his body, appearing incredibly sacred. He suddenly opened his eyes, two golden rays shooting out, and the golden light on his body instantly retracted, disappearing into his physique. Yang Ji looked at his palm, a flicker of joy in his eyes, and said, "Volume One of the Humanoid Weapon has finally reached Perfection."

He then took out the Flowing Light Sword, its sharp blade gleaming with chilling light, but he swung it fiercely towards his own palm without any defense. With a "clang," the Flowing Light Sword struck his arm, sparks flying, and then bounced back. His arm was unharmed, but a large chip appeared on the sword's blade. The high-grade magical artifact, Flowing Light Sword, was actually damaged in a direct collision with his arm. Seeing such a result, Yang Ji was greatly satisfied, muttering, "After the Humanoid Weapon reached the Perfection realm, my entire body is indeed as strong as a supreme-grade magical artifact. I wonder to what extent the subsequent legacy left by Senior Fu Dongliu can be cultivated? Can it reach the level of a Dao artifact?"

Thinking this, Yang Ji couldn't restrain himself. He got up, pushed open the secret chamber door, and walked out. After briefly informing Jian Yuanzi, he changed his appearance and flew out of Sword Dao Peak, then out of Canglan Sect, heading towards the Demon-Scented Sea Domain. Now that Volume One of his cultivation method was perfected, he was qualified to obtain the legacy. Taking a large ship, after a month, he finally arrived at the Demon-Scented Sea Domain. Yang Ji didn't linger elsewhere and flew directly towards the underwater waterfall near Wangmo Island. A day later, he had already reached the familiar location.

After so many years, the underwater waterfall appeared even more natural. The rock walls on both sides were covered in aquatic plants and moss. Without the sky-reaching spiritual light, the underwater waterfall also seemed more ordinary. However, its magnificent "three thousand feet of flowing water" spectacle had not diminished in the slightest, and the roaring sound of the waterfall remained deafening. Last time, after the three Great Nascent Soul True Monarchs jointly investigated the underground world without success, they had informed the Supremes of their respective families to come and investigate, but still nothing was found. Such a result was within Yang Ji's expectations. After all, restrictions laid down by experts involving the Dao were not something that Transformation God Supremes like them could easily detect. Yang Ji hovered above the waterfall at this moment, observing downwards for a while. After seeing no danger information displayed, he then plunged down, following the flowing water. After passing through a broken spatial restriction, with a "whoosh," he arrived in the underground world once more.

The ancient 'qiu' trees and devil solitary figures, upon seeing his appearance, were all startled, and then began to harbor ill intentions. Yang Ji swept his gaze, smiled faintly, and sent out a soul fluctuation, saying, "You'd better behave yourselves, or I'll burn you all to ashes." As he spread his palm, the Samadhi True Fire burst forth with a roar. The scorching heat caused the surrounding air to distort. Seeing Yang Ji's intimidation and the powerful strength he displayed, how could those ancient 'qiu' trees and devil solitary figures dare to attack him? The instinct for survival drove them to flee, and in a short while, they comically vanished.

Yang Ji smiled faintly, ignoring them, and immediately walked towards the stone array. Using his Golden Finger ability, he quickly passed through the stone array, and now stood once again at the end of the underground world, with a rock wall before him, blocking any further path. Yang Ji looked forward, and "Concealment Restriction" and "Spatial Teleportation Restriction" appeared.

[Teleportation Condition: A fated individual who has cultivated Volume One of the Humanoid Weapon to Perfection.]

Yang Ji no longer hesitated. He activated his cultivation method, and golden light overflowed from his body. As the golden light touched the "Concealment Restriction," a semi-transparent air wall appeared before him amidst shimmering waves. Yang Ji knew that the "Spatial Teleportation Restriction" hidden beneath the "Concealment Restriction" had appeared. He immediately activated his cultivation method with full force, reaching out to press against the Spatial Teleportation Restriction. Instantly, a suction force appeared on the Spatial Teleportation Restriction, firmly locking onto him. Immediately after, an invisible force probed into his body, scanning him back and forth like divine sense. Yang Ji felt as exposed as a naked maiden, scrutinized thoroughly. Soon, a stronger suction force came, enveloping his entire body. With a "whoosh," his entire body seemed to be sucked into a bubble of water, and then squeezed out from the other side.

Yang Ji knew he had passed through the restriction. Raising his eyes and looking forward, he saw that beyond this spatial teleportation restriction was actually a hidden paradise. As far as the eye could see, an area of a few mu, spiritual energy condensed into mist, with houses of various sizes built in a scattered but orderly manner. Outside the houses, blue flagstones paved the ground, fragrant flowers and plants grew, ponds and pavilions, small springs and flowing water – everything was present. It was truly tranquil and leisurely, an excellent place for secluded cultivation. Yang Ji looked around, and various information appeared: "Spirit Gathering Array," "Fish Pond," "Flower Garden," "Kitchen," "Medicine Garden," "Vegetable Garden," "Tide-Listening Chamber," "Legacy Ground," "Alchemy Room," "Refining Room."

Seeing these information displays, Yang Ji's eyes flickered slightly, and he secretly sighed, "Senior Fu Dongliu truly was someone who knew how to enjoy life." Ordinary cultivators in seclusion wouldn't bother with such fancy things; they'd find a secluded spot and sit for centuries. It seems those who embrace ritual in life are more formidable in comprehending the Dao.

Yang Ji carefully examined his surroundings. After confirming there was no danger, he walked directly towards the "Legacy Ground." He passed through the ancient houses, pushed open a door, and saw a futon covered in strange patterns, upon which lay three shimmering jade slips. His gaze swept over them, and information immediately appeared: "Induction Futon," "Humanoid Weapon Volume Two," "Humanoid Weapon Volume Three," "Humanoid Weapon Volume Four."

Yang Ji didn't act rashly. He scanned the room thoroughly in all directions, and even after stepping into the room and holding the three jade slips, he was still in a state of doubt. *He just obtained the legacy like this?* "This was too simple!" If it weren't for the Golden Finger indicating no danger, and if it weren't for the Golden Finger indicating that what he held in his hand was indeed a cultivation method, he wouldn't have believed for a second that he had obtained the legacy so easily. Yang Ji silently pondered for a moment and then understood: the competition and danger weren't here, but rather came from other legacy seekers like himself. It was simply that his immortal fate was profound; the earthquake had prematurely broken through the outer spatial restriction and opened the cave dwelling. Otherwise, decades later, whether he could seize the legacy from a multitude of other seekers would have been uncertain.

But now, he was filled with joy and unceremoniously put away the jade slips. The feeling of picking the fruit ahead of time was truly wonderful. He wondered what the other legacy seekers would think when they arrived here decades later, only to find the legacy had already been taken ahead of time? Their faces would probably turn black. Yang Ji thought to himself, a smug smile involuntarily appearing at the corner of his mouth. After collecting the jade slips, he glanced at the futon covered in strange patterns. This was the Induction Futon. Decades later, it would emit a legacy sensation, drawing other seekers to this place. "This was a hot potato; he couldn't take it."

Yang Ji quickly withdrew his gaze and then headed towards the nearby "Medicine Garden." However, it was completely empty, not even a blade of grass. There was plenty of spiritual mist, though, as three Spirit Gathering Arrays were set up inside. The array patterns were mysteriously inscribed, carved with Dao patterns. Even if he understood them, he couldn't replicate them. Yang Ji glanced at them briefly, noting down the general patterns, and then left the Medicine Garden, continuing towards the nearby "Vegetable Garden." He was curious what kind of vegetables such a great figure would eat, but he was disappointed. It was also completely empty, containing only spiritual soil. Then, he followed the path further inside. He quickly passed through the "Kitchen," "Fish Pond," "Flower Garden," and "Tide-Listening Chamber."

These places also contained nothing, not even a single kitchen knife. Yang Ji couldn't help but feel depressed. He looked up and walked deeper inside. There were two more places further in: the "Alchemy Room" and the "Refining Room." Yang Ji looked up towards the Alchemy Room, and instantly, various pieces of information appeared, making his body tremble.

[Alchemy Room], [Nine-Revolutions Golden Core], [Nine-Revolutions Golden Core], [Nine-Revolutions Golden Core]

His eyes were filled with displays of Nine-Revolutions Golden Core information. Yang Ji's eyes widened. He immediately flew towards the Alchemy Room. As soon as he pushed the door open, a golden light surged forth, greatly shocking him. The entire room was filled with golden pills suspended in mid-air, their fragrance assailing his nostrils, a scene that intensely stimulated his eyes.

"So many Nine-Revolutions Golden Cores!" Yang Ji was ecstatic, but he maintained his composure. Looking around, he indeed saw a line of characters carved on the ground with Dao patterns.

[Whether you are the fated individual to receive the legacy or a fated individual who came to compete for the legacy, entering here is fate. All pills can be taken.]
[These Nine-Revolutions Golden Cores were refined by me from my own cultivated herbs in my leisure time. They are not considered very good, but if you fancy them, you may take them all.]

Yang Ji was dumbfounded. Nine-Revolutions Golden Cores? And these weren't considered good? He glanced at them, and information appeared, revealing that these Nine-Revolutions Golden Cores could provide him with 700 cultivation points in a single day. What kind of concept was this? It meant that if he consistently consumed these Nine-Revolutions Golden Cores, he could reach the peak of Golden Core in just over fifty years. If he relied on Demonic Essence Pills, which increased cultivation by 120 points per day, it would take over three hundred years to reach Golden Core peak. The value difference was immense, as one could imagine.

Yang Ji had learned about these Nine-Revolutions Golden Cores from his conversations with Jian Yuanzi. Even in the Dao Sect, they were considered excellent cultivation pills, usually only consumed by prodigious disciples with Spirit Bodies or Sacred Bodies. The remaining disciples generally consumed One-Revolutions Golden Cores or Three-Revolutions Golden Cores. These Nine-Revolutions Golden Cores might have been ordinary in Fu Dongliu's eyes, but in Yang Ji's eyes, they were supreme treasures. "This was destiny." How could he not fancy them? He immediately swept his hand, collecting all the Nine-Revolutions Golden Cores in the room into his storage.

This fortuitous encounter was truly enormous. Not only did he obtain the subsequent cultivation methods for the Humanoid Weapon, but he also acquired a large quantity of Nine-Revolutions Golden Cores. Such immortal fate was off the charts. No wonder Jian Yuanzi said that one-third of immortal cultivation relies on fortuitous encounters. Indeed, some things can only be obtained through luck. If not for that earthquake, how could Yang Ji have arrived in this underground world early to seize this opportunity? Filled with gratitude and reverence, he immediately bowed towards the characters carved on the ground, paying his respects to Senior Fu Dongliu and thanking him for his gifts.

Then he turned and bowed towards the door, as if thanking the earthquake for the opportunity it had brought. Yang Ji was overjoyed at this moment. He exited the Alchemy Room, then turned and walked into the "Refining Room." As soon as he pushed open the door, another eye-catching scene presented itself: a dazzling array of weapons floated in mid-air, each enveloped in a ball of spiritual light. At a glance, there were dozens of them. Yang Ji was incredibly excited. "What grade of weapons must these be? Refined by such a great figure, were they treasure artifacts? Or Dao artifacts?"

He quickly scanned them, but soon, his excitement died down: "Low-grade Magical Artifact," "Medium-grade Spirit Artifact," "Supreme-grade Magical Artifact," "Low-grade Spirit Artifact." At a glance, most were magical artifacts and spirit artifacts. Yang Ji couldn't help but be greatly disappointed, and a hint of doubt arose in his mind: how could the quality of weapons refined by such a figure be so low? He subconsciously looked at the ground and indeed found another line of small characters carved with Dao patterns.

[In my leisure time, I refined some small trinkets using materials from this underground world. Although their grade is not high, each one was refined to be extremely perfect and flawless. If any fated individual who comes here likes them, they may take them all.]

Seeing this, Yang Ji exclaimed "No wonder!" in his heart. So, these were just trinkets refined by Senior Fu Dongliu using materials from this underground world. No wonder their grades weren't very high. Good materials yield good artifacts. Presumably, there weren't many good materials in this underground world that could be used to refine high-grade weapons. However, Yang Ji still looked at the levitating weapon light clusters with hopeful eyes, hoping to find one or two higher-grade magical treasures.

After a thorough scan, suddenly, Yang Ji's eyes lit up, his gaze locking onto one of the weapon light clusters.
