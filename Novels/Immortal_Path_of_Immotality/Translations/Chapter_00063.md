# Chapter 63: Journey to Yichuan

In the depths of the night sky, two fireworks illuminated two mountain peaks, their lights intertwining.

Lin Shan watched from beneath a tree, knowing that Princess Guo and her companions were nearby. This wasn't a safe place to linger. He immediately retraced his steps.

Returning to the previous battlefield, he found only chaos remaining. Huang the Immortal Master lay on the ground, his condition unknown. Lin Shan hurried to his side and saw that the lower half of Huang's body was a mangled mess. Flying ants gnawed at his flesh while laying eggs, some even crawling in and out of his intestines—a scene too gruesome to behold.

Panicking, Lin Shan suddenly remembered something. He took out the green-robed elder's storage pouch, retrieved a small pagoda, and attempted to activate it to collect the ants. But his spiritual energy wouldn't enter the artifact—it had already been refined by the green-robed elder. To use it, he'd first need to erase the elder's spiritual imprint.

Sweat beaded on Lin Shan's forehead as he realized this approach wouldn't work. He resorted to plucking the ants off one by one, crushing them between his fingers.

At this moment, Huang the Immortal Master on the ground spoke weakly, "Brother Lin... don't... waste your effort..."

Lin Shan ignored him, continuing his futile insect extermination.

"Brother Lin... I have a request..."

With great difficulty, Huang removed the storage pouch from his waist and placed it at Lin Shan's feet. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth as his complexion grew increasingly ashen. Already ninety years old, his vital energy severely depleted, it seemed unlikely he would survive the night.

Lin Shan stopped his pointless efforts, realizing Huang was preparing his final words.

"In the storage pouch... there's a letter... give it to her... silver for Yichuan... to buy her freedom..."

Huang spoke slowly, his cloudy eyes barely able to focus. His remaining words were whispers, barely audible.

Lin Shan leaned closer, catching only the final phrase:

"After completing this... you may take the rest..."

A strong mountain wind howled, rustling through falling leaves.

Huang the Immortal Master fell silent, his life force exhausted, his time come sooner than expected.

Lin Shan gazed quietly at the old man with whom he'd spent less than a month—fifty obscure years as a mortal, twenty as a servant in Yichuan, another twenty carousing at the Nightingale headquarters upon his return, only to die in these unknown depths of the Yan Yun Mountains.

"Very well... I'll help you this once."

Glancing at the storage pouch, Lin Shan closed Huang's eyes.

A quarter-hour later, four cultivators of varying appearances appeared beside the green-robed elder's corpse, including Princess Guo and the brocade-robed middle-aged man.

"It must be that young man who fought me by the stream that day," Princess Guo examined the elder's wounds, noting residual ice fragments—evidence of Lin Shan's mid-grade magic artifact.

"That Nightingale consultant named Lin?" came an old woman's voice.

"Who else could it be?" The brocade-robed man scowled. "This green-robed old fox played both sides—first leaking information to us while hiding his identity, then blocking our two comrades from reinforcing us by the stream."

"Just two days ago we formed an alliance to track the two Nightingale members, and today he sneaks off alone to take all the spoils! The hunter got hunted in the end!"

The others joined in cursing the green-robed elder, agreeing he got what he deserved. After venting, they all turned to the brocade-robed man, clearly their usual leader.

The leader silently studied the trail of the green-robed elder's final flight.

A day later, a young man in white robes walked deep into the Yan Yun Mountains, arriving at a place shrouded in thick fog.

"This should be the place," Lin Shan murmured.

Comparing the map from Huang's storage pouch with his surroundings, he confirmed this was the outer illusion array of Yichuan Market. Following the incantation Huang had taught him, he watched as the fog parted to form a passage just tall enough for a person. Lin Shan stepped through.

After about a hundred paces, the mist dissipated, revealing a breathtaking vista.

A surge of dense spiritual energy washed over him. Lin Shan inhaled deeply—the concentration here was five times that of the outside world, and this was just the periphery.

Before him stretched rolling green hills, babbling brooks, and birdsong among fragrant blossoms—it felt like stepping into a cultivation paradise.

Following the mountain path for several li, he saw terraced fields lining the slopes below, crisscrossed with irrigation channels. Rows of golden crops swayed in the breeze, their rich wheat fragrance mingling with spiritual energy that wafted through the mountains.

"Spirit fields?" Lin Shan marveled, intoxicated by the aromatic, energy-rich air.

He descended to inspect the golden wheat stalks, each grain plump and lustrous, enough to make one's mouth water.

In the distance, several cultivators worked the fields, employing spells to sow, fertilize, water, and control temperatures—some even manipulating clouds to produce rain.

Lin Shan observed their agricultural cultivation quietly as he passed, not wishing to disturb.

Beyond the fields, he climbed another mountain where laughter and conversation drifted from a pavilion at the summit.

Ascending hundreds of stone steps, Lin Shan reached the peak.

The mountaintop bloomed with vibrant flowers of every color—spring orchids and autumn chrysanthemums flourishing together out of season. Among the floral sea stood five pavilions, three of which hosted groups of three to five cultivators each.

They raised cups and paused their chopsticks, floating wine cups along a winding stream while demonstrating minor spells for critique and appreciation between laughter.

Lin Shan approached cautiously. When no one paid him attention, he quietly took a corner seat, pretending to admire the flowers while eavesdropping.

The cultivators took turns sharing stories—travel anecdotes, cultivation insights, demonstrations of newly-learned spells, or tales of the strange and supernatural.

Lin Shan listened enthralled, longing to join but aware of his shallow knowledge and low cultivation. Speaking up might invite ridicule, and forcing his way into their circle would only breed resentment. Simply listening from the sidelines proved immensely rewarding.

Suddenly, a voice called out, "Brother Daoist, I happen to have brought a jar of spirit wine from my travels in Great Yan. Won't you join us for a taste?"

Startled to realize the invitation was for him, Lin Shan rose hastily and bowed. "This humble Lin is newly arrived in Yichuan. Hearing your profound wisdom, I became lost in admiration—I meant no offense..."

A young nobleman in white robes matching Lin Shan's attire smiled warmly and gestured to a seat. "No need for formalities, honored guest! Please join us!"

The four or five others nodded agreement, pulling Lin Shan into their circle. The white-robed youth produced a wine jar and filled everyone's cups, its fragrance instantly permeating the pavilion and attracting drinkers from others.

The white-robed youth welcomed all comers, and soon the gathering grew boisterous with laughter, song, and uninhibited dancing.

As a newcomer, Lin Shan remained reserved, nodding appreciatively and sipping sparingly.

The wine truly lived up to its reputation as Great Yan spirit brew—each sip refreshed mind and body, its spiritual energy equivalent to a full day's meditation!

Lin Shan restrained himself, knowing such precious liquor wasn't to be abused. His host's generosity in sharing didn't license greed—he knew his place.

Through discreet observation, Lin Shan noted all present were at least late Qi Refining stage. Some had eyes gleaming with spiritual light, likely nearing the threshold of external divine sense—probably peak Qi Refining, just steps from Foundation Building.

As evening fell after their philosophical discussions, the group dispersed.

Some left Yichuan in small groups, others took separate paths alone. One particularly inebriated fellow sprawled bare-chested in the pavilion, snoring against the mountain breeze.

Before departing, the white-robed youth offered Lin Shan guidance: "I notice you're new here, Brother Daoist. Turning right ahead leads straight to the market."

Lin Shan expressed gratitude and asked his name.

The youth freely identified himself as Gongsun Yu from the Gongsun cultivation clan. All present today, he explained, were young masters and ladies from major cultivation families traveling together through Yichuan.

After brief pleasantries, Gongsun Yu descended the mountain.

Lin Shan sighed inwardly—today's experiences had exceeded his expectations, leaving him reluctant to depart.

This was the true world of cultivation he'd imagined.
