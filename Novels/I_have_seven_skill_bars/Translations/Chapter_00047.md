# Chapter 47: Sect Domain

The Horse Cultivation Sect's mountain gate was located not far from the Profound Talisman Sect. It was so close that Ding Rui found it rather surprising. Moreover, not far away, he saw another vast stretch of spirit fields, lush and verdant, but they didn't belong to the Profound Talisman Sect.

"Senior Ma Yun, these spirit fields are...?" Ding Rui couldn't help but ask.

Ma Yun glanced in the direction Ding Rui pointed and said, "Those are the Spirit Sword Sect's spirit fields. Your two sects are quite close to each other."

"In reality, the entire Sect Domain is packed together," Ma Tu explained from the side. "Evil cultivators are powerful, and the Huaqing Realm is pervasive. We can only huddle together for warmth. Things have gotten much better these past few years; before, our territory was smaller and even more crowded."

"So that's how it is." Ding Rui nodded. He then suddenly realized that he had always wanted to know more about the history of this cultivation world.

"So evil cultivators aren't a unified entity? Just as I suspected," Ding Rui thought to himself, then asked aloud, "What's the current situation like? Are we still at a disadvantage when facing evil cultivators? After all, for them, there's no reason to completely eradicate us, right?"

"That's right, evil cultivators don't have a reason to wipe us out. Some powerful evil cultivators even hope the Sect Domain develops better, so it can provide them with stable resources," Ma Yun sighed. "Currently, many evil cultivators won't easily act against us, but there are still some powerful ones who will occasionally attack the Sect Domain. After all, for cultivators in our Sect Domain, the most crucial spirit fields are located here. Spirit fields can't be moved, so we can't go anywhere else. They make for the best targets, while other cultivators and evil cultivators can migrate freely. However, the most powerful forces among evil cultivators cannot unite, and that's the most important factor. This allows us to resist and steadily improve. I believe it won't be long before our Sect Domain no longer fears evil cultivators."

Ding Rui nodded after listening. All of this was unexpected, yet it was quite logical and well-reasoned.

With Ma Yun and Ma Tu's patient explanations, he asked all his questions along the way. Of course, there were some questions that even the two powerful Horse Cultivators, Ma Yun and Ma Tu, didn't know the answers to. As for what they did know, Ding Rui naturally committed it all to memory after hearing it, not daring to miss a single word. But after learning so much, this cultivation world seemed even more mysterious and confusing to Ding Rui.

Firstly, the Sect Domain was established by a group of human cultivators, and spirit rice was also brought by these human cultivators at the time. However, no one knew where these human cultivators originally came from. Originally, there were human cultivators in the Huaqing Realm, but their numbers were small, especially compared to other communal races, such as Wolf Cultivators. These human cultivators had originally gathered to form a force. Although they united against external threats, there were also conflicts and infighting among themselves. They were also evil cultivators, or more precisely, they belonged to a chaotic, temporary organization. After the Sect Domain was established, that organization of human cultivators immediately disbanded.
