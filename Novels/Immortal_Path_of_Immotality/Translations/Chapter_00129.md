# Chapter 128: The Imminent Crisis

For an entire night, Lin Shan tried various methods to lure out the "Devourer Worm" hidden in his mysterious acupoint. But as the Turtle Sage had warned, this plump white worm showed no interest in anything except the white mist the old man produced—a rare type of gu worm in the cultivation world.

Lin Shan exhausted every item and technique at his disposal, even summoning all nearby sea creatures through incantations. Yet the Devourer Worm remained deep in his dantian, sound asleep without the slightest hint of appetite.

"Is there really no solution?" 

Frustrated, Lin Shan cursed the Turtle Sage's ancestors eighteen generations back, but ultimately had to admit defeat. The worm was nestled in an acupoint connected to his next cultivation stage, completely beyond his reach. To extract it, he'd need to break through his current bottleneck—but having just entered the early Foundation Establishment stage, forcibly advancing was impossible.

The worst part? The worm needed to feed daily. 

This meant Lin Shan would have to report to the Turtle Sage every day for his ration of white mist. Any delay, and the Devourer Worm would cut off his path forward.

By dawn, a gloomy and helpless Lin Shan flew off the island to begin another patrol.

The demonic sects had tightened security across surrounding waters. After severely injuring the Turtle Sage days prior, they'd realized he couldn't have gone far to recuperate, prompting frequent sweeping operations.

While patrolling the Xiayi Sea, Lin Shan encountered several groups—led by core disciples of the Blood River Hall and Hundred Ghost Sect—clearly searching for the Turtle Sage to eliminate the threat once and for all.

Anxiety gnawed at him. His cave currently harbored two fugitives. If discovered, no amount of explaining would clear his name. 

Report them? Could the demonic sects even cure him? Lin Shan doubted it. Though the sects boasted experts up to Nascent Soul stage, the Devourer Worm required daily feeding—could he last until then? By the time a Nascent Soul elder arrived, it'd be too late!

His only backer, Yan Yuanchun, was merely a Golden Core protector from the local faction—without Nascent Soul connections to help remove the gu worm.

After exchanging information with passing "allies" all day, Lin Shan returned empty-handed to his territory.

Back on Xiayi Island, Lin Shan rushed to his old cave. The Devourer Worm had awakened, sniffing around his acupoints as if choosing where to bite. Terrified of provoking the Turtle Sage's wrath, he nearly panicked.

Fortunately, the Turtle Sage and his disciple were punctual. The mid-Foundation Establishment youth waited at the cave entrance. "You're late. Don't want the antidote?"

Snatching the vial, Lin Shan steadied his racing heart. Peering inside, he noticed the Turtle Sage's absence. "Where's Senior Turtle? I'd like to consult him."

"Master's cultivating. From now on, I'll deliver the antidote. Scram!" The disciple sneered, recalling Lin Shan's theatrics the previous night—how dare this fool try to outsmart his master?

Unable to meet the Turtle Sage, Lin Shan left quickly after collecting the antidote.

---

Back in his new cave, dark thoughts swirled:
"What if the Turtle Sage recovers and abandons me?"
"What if he dies before curing me?"
"What if demonic sect searchers find him here?"

With a heavy heart, Lin Shan inhaled the white mist. The restless worm calmed, returning to sleep. He kept the vial, noting the disciple's residual aura on it.

Over following days, Lin Shan maintained his patrol routine while desperately trying to lure out the worm at night. Even using the white mist as bait failed—unless inhaled into his dantian, the worm wouldn't sense it, choosing instead to gnaw his acupoints.

---

Then came dire news: The joint enforcement team's Golden Core protectors would soon sweep Xiayi Sea with dragnet searches.

This changed everything. 

Whether the Turtle Sage healed or not, discovery meant doom. Even if the old man escaped, Lin Shan would be left with an unsolved gu worm problem. His only options were solving the worm issue tonight, or gambling on reporting the fugitives tomorrow—risking his cultivation future to avoid being branded a traitor.

After collecting that day's antidote and failing to glean information about the Turtle Sage's condition, Lin Shan turned desperate. That evening, he gathered his subordinates—over a hundred Qi Cultivation stage rogue cultivators—seeking any possible solution regarding spirit insects or gu worms.

"Insect-repelling pills here!"
"Coral worms love this mayfly paste!"
"Rainbow-winged butterflies adore this rosemary!"
"Flying moth bats hate this spirit turtle saliva!"

Lin Shan tried everything indiscriminately, relying on his enhancement panel to avoid poisoning. When all attempts failed, he sat dejected by the fire, resigned to betrayal.

Then his top lieutenant, the "Conversion Expert" Old Man Zhong, spoke up thoughtfully: "This old man possesses Blood Venom Gu that can evolve other gu worms. Perhaps the master would care to try it?"
