# Chapter 183: System Upgrade

The closer he got to the World Origin, the more he felt an overwhelming majesty. It was an ineffable sensation; the majesty carried no oppressive force, yet it made one involuntarily solemn.

Dazzling golden light appeared before his eyes. Zhou Tian's eyes widened, for he saw an incomparably colossal golden hand. Each finger was as immense as a mountain, with runic chains coiling around them, and the palm lines were strikingly lifelike.

The fingers were slightly bent, as if grasping something. Through the gaps, he could see an object radiating the light of the Great Dao, bobbing up and down. Waves of fluctuations continuously emanated from it, and each wave caused the fingers of the golden hand to slightly part.

The moment he saw this object, an indescribable feeling arose within Zhou Tian. An epiphany struck him, and he opened the Undying System. Sure enough, a line of small text had refreshed on the system log interface:

"System upgrade material discovered. Host, please acquire it!"

Zhou Tian's pupils suddenly contracted. System upgrade! It had finally appeared. All previous signs indicated that the system could be upgraded, but it had never given a clear objective. So, it required the World Origin.

Truly worthy of being the panacea of the Star Realm, even capable of upgrading the system. Zhou Tian pondered to himself, scanning his surroundings.

Many people were already waiting there, all standing in the void, their gazes fixed on the colossal hand with fervent eagerness. Everyone recognized it as the World Origin and longed to acquire it.

Sensing the arrival of Saint Demon and Zhou Tian, everyone was utterly shaken; a few even swayed unsteadily in the void. Saint Demon had not concealed his cultivation, so they perceived that his strength had reached the Dao Lord realm. Everyone found it hard to believe.

Because they were all Heavenly Kings, they naturally understood the difficulty of breaking through to the Dao Lord realm.

Yet, at the same time, it felt natural. After all, this was a Celestial Venerable's Tomb; anything was possible.

Zhou Tian also saw a few slightly familiar faces—the Heavenly Kings who had entered before them. The ape from the Arm-Reaching Golden Ape clan was among them, holding a massive copper staff and clad in armor, exuding a fierce and imposing demeanor. It scratched its ears and cheeks, its pupils containing blazing golden flames, utterly shocked by Saint Demon's breakthrough.

The golden hand had not yet opened; everyone was waiting.

Suddenly, a ripple appeared in the void not far from the golden hand. A figure with a pointy snout and sunken cheeks emerged, then silently collapsed. Its true form was revealed to be a palm-sized mouse with no fur on its skin, but instead, some silvery light spots.

"How foolish!" someone snorted coldly, his tone filled with disdain.

"What if it's a Void Rat? This is a sealing array left by a Celestial Venerable. What a pity for that corpse."

Someone licked his lips and swallowed, a true gourmand who coveted even mouse meat.

Not far from this corpse, several other bodies lay scattered. They were humanoid beings, neatly dressed, with peaceful expressions, as if they had experienced no pain before death.

Those were people who had tried to approach prematurely, suppressed and killed by the golden hand.

"That thing is useful to me. Help me get it," Zhou Tian said to Saint Demon.

Saint Demon turned to look at him, his body radiating divine light, ensuring no one could perceive their conversation.

"You're truly unreserved." Saint Demon didn't dwell on it much. The World Origin was useful even to a pig, let alone Zhou Tian.

"When an elder brother instructs his younger brother, there's no need for politeness," Zhou Tian quipped.

Saint Demon was silent for a moment before speaking: "Alright. You help me once, I'll repay you once."

"Help me draw attention, and I can sneak straight in." Zhou Tian rubbed his fists, feeling impatient. Any sealing array was effectively useless to him.

"I advise you not to. That's not just a sealing array; it's a killing array. Even I might not survive it, unless you can directly touch the World Origin and have it provide you protection," Saint Demon stopped Zhou Tian.

"Uh..." Zhou Tian calculated the distance. Looking at a single finger that was nearly ten thousand li long, his own teleportation range was truly insignificant. Even if he copied Saint Demon's cultivation, it would be useless, because he couldn't use other skills while using the [Cultivation Copy] skill. Even if he could use it, he still couldn't go. Hadn't Saint Demon just said even he might not survive?

"So, we can only wait for it to emerge?" Zhou Tian said dejectedly. Once the World Origin emerged, it would inevitably lead to another major battle, which would be quite troublesome. The Dao Lords of Abyssal Tomb and Border Prison hadn't arrived yet. It would be best if they could "steal the chicken" (gain an advantage stealthily), but unfortunately, they couldn't.

"That's right." Saint Demon nodded, then said: "But you don't need to worry too much. We can exchange our non-involvement with that forbidden treasure for the Border Prison's Dao Lord not making a move. In reality, we only need to deal with the Abyssal Tomb's Dao Lord."

"Not getting involved with the forbidden treasure? Isn't that a huge loss?" Zhou Tian asked, astonished.

"Firstly, you need to be able to obtain it, and secondly, you need to be able to keep it safe. The Nine Provinces are currently in the eye of a storm. If you want to face two Dao Lords simultaneously while contending for the World Origin, and also offend Border Prison, the third-ranked major power, causing them to make a move on the Nine Provinces as well, then I wouldn't mind trying to seize that forbidden object," Saint Demon explained.

"Uh... then forget it. Anything 'forbidden' sounds inauspicious," Zhou Tian chuckled wryly.

Suddenly, Saint Demon abruptly turned to the east, golden light flaring in his eyes, and softly said: "The people from Abyssal Tomb have arrived."

In the east, black mist surged, overwhelming the world. The earth trembled. There, a crimson glow pierced the heavens, tearing through the firmament.

*Boom!*

Boundless blood qi surged forth, truly horrifying. The entire sky turned crimson, and the vast firmament was completely covered by the blood qi.

This was somewhat unimaginable. A mere being, yet his blood qi soared to the heavens, actually capable of covering the sky and suppressing this expanse of heaven and earth.

However, Saint Demon remained calm. Although this blood qi was dense, it was mostly a phenomenon. If it were his true blood qi covering such a vast territory, it would only be a futile expenditure with no effect whatsoever.

*Rumble!*

The southern sky trembled. In a blur, the black light receded, and the blood qi grew even denser, while golden light burst forth. A blurred figure emerged. He resembled an emperor, his aura grand and majestic, gradually appearing beneath the firmament as if to sever the past and present, to traverse the ancient cosmos, looking down upon the world. It was truly terrifying.

This was an overlord, looking down upon the mortal world with disdain. Billions of golden light rays surged, and the entire void trembled amidst the blood qi and this majestic golden light.

"Why make such a grand display? He's just a Dao Lord. What a show-off," Zhou Tian curled his lip in disdain. It was all just formalism, without any practical meaning.

"The Abyssal Tomb clan is very special. Every member possesses formidable strength and extremely heaven-defying innate skills. They have the right to be so disdainful." Saint Demon, however, didn't react much. For powerful individuals, having a certain bearing was natural.
