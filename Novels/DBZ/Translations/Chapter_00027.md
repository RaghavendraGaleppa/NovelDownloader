# Chapter 27: The Legacy of Alchemy

Tap, tap, tap. The crisp sound of footsteps echoed.

Lu Ping opened his tightly closed eyes, preparing to face the judgment of fate. In his mind, he had already prepared a series of excuses, hoping they might save his life.

But when he actually saw the newcomer, he froze in surprise.

Because the person before him was astonishingly young!

Was this really the person who had slain the notorious Three Evils of the Sang Clan?

Before Lu Ping could speak, the young man's next action left him utterly bewildered.

A streak of black light shot forth, accurately shattering the chains binding his hands and feet.

An ally, not an enemy? What was going on here?

"Are you Lu Ping, the Talisman Master?" Wei Qian asked, though he already knew the answer.

Lu Ping nodded slowly. "Yes."

"I was invited by Bai Fugui to come rescue you," Wei Qian explained.

At this, understanding dawned on Lu Ping. So it was Bai Fugui who had saved him in the end! All those years of treating him to good food and drink hadn't been in vain. Though his mind raced with thoughts, Lu Ping still clasped his hands respectfully toward Wei Qian. "Regardless, I thank you for your assistance, fellow Daoist."

Seeing Lu Ping's attitude, Wei Qian felt reassured. He certainly didn't want to have rescued an ungrateful wretch.

"To avoid complications, we should leave immediately," Lu Ping quickly suggested. This place held painful memories, and he couldn't wait to depart.

"There's one more thing to do before we go," Wei Qian said as they exited the compound. The raging flames were already approaching the building.

In his previous life, extinguishing such a mountain fire would have required tremendous manpower. But in this world, Wei Qian only needed to act.

He channeled his spiritual power and cast the Spring Breeze Transforms Rain technique. The clouds above were drawn downward, and moments later, rain began to fall.

After casting the technique thirteen times in succession—depleting his spiritual energy twice—and pulling down every nearby cloud to summon continuous rainfall, the mountain fire was finally extinguished.

"You have a compassionate heart, fellow Daoist," Lu Ping remarked.

"The fire was set by me, so it's only right that I put it out," Wei Qian replied.

Fortunately, he had eliminated the Three Evils of Sang quickly enough that the fire hadn't completely engulfed Blackwind Ridge. Otherwise, with his Qi Refining cultivation, extinguishing it would have been impossible. That would have required at least a Foundation Establishment expert.

When Wei Qian and Lu Ping descended from Blackwind Ridge, Bai Fugui, who had been hiding, saw them and was overjoyed.

He rushed out immediately. "What about those three?"

Wei Qian replied succinctly, "Dead."

Bai Fugui heaved a sigh of relief. "Good, very good."

Though somewhat cowardly, Bai Fugui wasn't foolish. He knew the best outcome for him was the complete elimination of the Three Evils of Sang, ensuring they couldn't seek revenge later.

Lu Ping stepped forward and embraced Bai Fugui, giving him a hearty pat on the shoulder. "Fatty, I owe you my life this time."

Bai Fugui chuckled modestly. "Hey, we're brothers, after all." He then took out his storage pouch and handed it to Wei Qian. "Brother Wei, here's the remaining half of the spirit stones."

"You shouldn't have to spend any more," Lu Ping said, stopping Bai Fugui's hand. He turned to Wei Qian. "If you don't mind, could you give me two days? I promise the reward will satisfy you."

After a moment's hesitation, Lu Ping borrowed a blank jade slip from Wei Qian and pressed it firmly against his forehead.

"Consider this a deposit," he said, returning the jade slip to Wei Qian.

Wei Qian had assumed Lu Ping was imprinting his talisman-making legacy and was intrigued. But when he placed the slip against his forehead to examine it, he realized it was something entirely different.

Lu Ping explained, "To my shame, though I have talent in talisman-making, I understand the 'how' but not the 'why.' It would take me thirty or forty years to organize a proper legacy."

"But due to certain circumstances, I've collected this legacy. I offer it to you as a gift."

Wei Qian set down the jade slip, his expression unreadable. "I trust your character, Fellow Daoist Lu. A two-day extension is no problem."

His amiable attitude was entirely due to the contents of the jade slip. It contained the primary legacy of alchemy—the foremost among the Hundred Arts of Cultivation!

The slip held over six thousand characters of foundational alchemical knowledge and two meticulously detailed pill recipes. This legacy was far more valuable than the thousand low-grade spirit stones Bai Fugui had promised.

"This deal is quite profitable," Wei Qian mused.

The three of them left Blackwind Ridge together, parting ways only after traveling fifty li and reaching a fork in the road.

Before they separated, Wei Qian sent a message to Bai Fugui, instructing him to continue procuring pills and medicinal herbs for him, along with several jars of high-quality spirit wine.

The pills were for his daily cultivation. Though he had recently broken through to the fifth level of Qi Refining and couldn't advance further in the short term, Wei Qian intended to use every spare moment to strengthen his spiritual power.

The herbs were for the medicinal baths required to practice the "Thousand Tribulations Body Tempering Art," as well as ingredients for the two pill recipes in the alchemy legacy.

Developing a cultivation skill was a time-consuming endeavor, but if that skill was alchemy, Wei Qian was more than willing to invest the time.

Returning quietly to Misty Ridge Mountain, Wei Qian found his seven-day leave still ongoing. He continued his rest, immersing himself in the study of the alchemy legacy.

He pored over the six-thousand-character foundational alchemy text repeatedly. Fortunately, it was recorded on a jade slip—had it been on paper, the pages would have been worn to tatters.

There were hundreds of methods for pill refinement, with fire refinement being the most mainstream. Wei Qian's spiritual roots leaned toward fire and wood, making him particularly suited for alchemy.

"Fire refinement can be divided into two types," Wei Qian read carefully. "One uses flames conjured by the cultivator, while the other relies on external fire sources."

Summoning flames was within his capabilities, but his fifth-level Qi Refining cultivation couldn't sustain spiritual flames for long periods. And pill refinement often required at least two or three hours per session.

"An external fire source is the solution," Wei Qian mused, frowning slightly.

But Misty Ridge Mountain was the territory of the Li Clan, a cultivation family. Setting up a pill furnace here would be too conspicuous and easily discovered.

Not that alchemy was forbidden—Wei Qian simply wanted to avoid complications, especially questions about the origin of his alchemical knowledge. The events at Blackwind Ridge were best kept between him, Lu Ping, and Bai Fugui, with no fourth party learning of them.

Wei Qian had no desire to draw attention just yet.

As he pondered where to find a suitable place to practice alchemy, an unexpected notice arrived the next day.

Li Wanqing had emerged from seclusion!
