Chapter 3: Fate's Replication

Li Zhi Ming was sleeping on his father's back, unaware of the weight of fate that hung over him. As an eight-year-old rural boy, he couldn't comprehend the complexities of destiny. His father, Li Chu Jiu, was relieved as they approached their home, a small courtyard surrounded by a pigpen and a goose enclosure.

As they entered the courtyard, a dark-skinned man stood up from the entrance, "Father, Mother, how's Fourth Brother doing?" Li Chu Jiu's eldest son, Li Da Ge, was referring to Li Zhi Ming. The man, Li Chu Jiu's brother or a hired hand, didn't wait for a response and said, "I'll go heat up some pancakes." He walked into the house.

Li Zhi Ming was the fourth child in the family. His eldest brother had passed away at the age of two, and he had an older sister who didn't live with them. Li Chu Jiu sighed as he sat down on the doorstep, eating a hard pancake and watching Li Zhi Ming eat a pancake and drink some wild vegetable soup.

"Fate is a heavy burden," Li Chu Jiu said, gazing at the dark night sky. "I had hoped to send the child to school, to have a scholar in the family, but the costs are too high." His wife, Zhang Shi, chimed in, "You can't just wish for the child to become a scholar. We need to be realistic about our circumstances."

Li Chu Jiu looked at Li Zhi Ming, who was eating his pancake without a care in the world. "I just wish we could be more than just farmers," Li Chu Jiu said, his voice filled with longing. Zhang Shi replied, "You think we can just become officials or nobles? We need to be content with our lot in life."

As they spoke, Li Zhi Ming gazed at the people around him, wondering about their fates. He saw the "fate grids" above their heads, a concept he didn't fully understand. Li Zhi Ming's own fate grid displayed the words "fourteen, early demise." Though he didn't fear death, he felt envious of others' lives.

As Li Zhi Ming sat there, he thought about the county magistrate, a man he considered to be a celestial being. He also thought about a chubby boy he had seen during the day, wondering why their fates were so different. Suddenly, Li Zhi Ming's eyes became sore, and he felt tears welling up.

In a flash, he saw a deep red font: "Fate Replication." The vision disappeared as quickly as it appeared. Li Zhi Ming saw the fate grids of his family members again, but this time, he saw more detailed information.

Li Chu Jiu's fate grid read: "Forty, laboring to death." Below this, Li Zhi Ming saw skills such as "Farmer Level 4" and "Hunter Level 1." The skills were accompanied by a prompt: "Caution is low, meet the conditions, replicate?"

Li Zhi Ming's eyes became increasingly painful, and he couldn't help but cry out in agony. His father, Li Chu Jiu, rushed to his side, concerned, "Child, what's wrong? Is your eye condition flaring up again?" Li Zhi Ming's face was contorted in pain, and he couldn't stop the tears from flowing. He closed his eyes, overwhelmed by the vision.
