# Chapter 714: Your Daoist Attainment Has Increased

As Han Shi's figure completely vanished into the dark and profound Reincarnation Nether Gate that continuously tore at the surrounding light, Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged atop the Cloud Terrace of the Divine霄 Palace. A barely perceptible ripple stirred in his heart.

He slowly closed his eyes, sinking his entire mind deep into his Sea of Consciousness. Through the Strong Control function on the Attribute Panel, he established a remote connection.

After all, although the Netherworld and the Taihua Spirit Void Realm were part of the same great world, they were actually separated by a barrier between the two realms. If it were any other True Lord, they would have no way to do this.

In the vision of the panel, a special monitoring window clearly reflected Han Shi's current state. This was a link established through the Strong Control attribute of the Cloud笈 Avatar Technique.

Xu Yunfan was like an observer standing outside the situation. Relying on the panel's feedback, he minutely felt every change in Han Shi's physical body, magic power, and soul, as well as the connection to the Reverse Fate Profound Mirror, after he stepped into the Netherworld passage.

The passage was not a space in the ordinary sense, but was filled with violent spatial-temporal turbulence and the erosion of extreme Yin and cold Netherworld power.

The Reverse Fate Profound Mirror held in Han Shi's hand, the seven North冥玄 Crystals embedded in the back of the mirror were emitting a faint power of reversing Yin and Yang. The dragon-scale patterns on the mirror surface, under the circulation of a cold light, were barely constructing a thin illusion barrier that simulated the True Spirit's return to the void, attempting to deceive the laws of the Netherworld.

This was the method of Yin-Yang transformation and life-and-death reversal. By feigning death to approach the Netherworld, one could then reverse death to achieve life.

It sounded simple, but the actual operation was extremely difficult.

Changes were occurring.

Real-time information from the Attribute Panel flooded Xu Yunfan's Sea of Consciousness like a waterfall.

‘Integrity of the Reverse Fate Profound Mirror's structure: 98.7%... 97.2%... 95.8%’

‘Fit between simulated law fluctuations and Netherworld laws: 76.3%... 74.1%’

‘Detecting abnormal spatial shearing force acting on the mirror body.’

‘Detecting high-intensity Yin Evil death qi infiltration.’

‘Rate of microscopic crack formation on the mirror surface: +0.3%/breath... +0.5%/breath.’

Glancing at these, Xu Yunfan felt a bit of helplessness. As expected, trying to learn the concept of life-and-death reincarnation from the White-Haired True Lord and apply it to artifact refining was truly too crude.

The scene shifted to Han Shi's perspective.

Caught in the violent spatial-temporal turbulence, Han Shi felt his Innate Sword Body being repeatedly cut and pulled apart by countless invisible blades. If it weren't for the flesh and tendons transformed from North冥寒 Iron being exceptionally tough, and supported by the Ten Thousand Year Sword Marrow Jade Sword Bones, he would have been torn to shreds long ago.

He gripped the Reverse Fate Profound Mirror in his hand tightly; this was his only reliance in this desperate situation. With his sword qi, trying to resist, he would likely be shattered by the turbulence in a single breath.

However, just as he was desperately urging his magic power into the Profound Mirror to stabilize his figure, his peripheral vision suddenly caught sight of the mirror, and his eyes twitched violently.

On the smooth, dark surface of the Profound Mirror, fine cracks as thin as hair had quietly appeared!

After these cracks appeared, they began to spread like living things across the mirror surface!

"What?!"

Han Shi's pupils contracted sharply. A chill instantly shot from his spine to the top of his head, even colder than the surrounding Yin Evil death qi.

The first thought that exploded in his mind was.

"Xu Yunfan, are you trying to kill me on purpose?! This Profound Mirror is a fake?!"

This thought was like a venomous snake biting his heart, making his eyes instantly tear apart with rage.

But the next moment, extreme anger was forcibly suppressed by reason.

No!

If Xu Yunfan truly wanted him dead, it would have been as easy as a single thought within the Divine霄 Palace to wipe out his true spirit. Why would he go to such great lengths to forge this body of infinite potential for him using Ten Thousand Year Sword Marrow Jade and North冥寒 Iron?

Why would he spend three years of effort deducing this so-called Reverse Fate Profound Mirror?

The only explanation was obvious.

This Reverse Fate Profound Mirror was fundamentally an unfinished product with huge flaws.

"Xu Yunfan, you bastard!!"

Han Shi's heart was instantly flooded with immense anger. He couldn't help but curse loudly in the violent turbulence, but his voice was torn apart by the Netherworld passage; only the surging hatred within the true spirit link was clearly transmitted.

"You're using me as a lab rat, using my life to fill the defects of your broken mirror!!"

The realization made Han Shi feel like a little white rabbit locked in a cage, pushed into an unknown danger to test the mechanism's performance, with no power to resist.

Entering this damn passage was all a gamble with his life.

The despair of the Cangming Dao Fruit's self-explosion seemed to surge up again. Old and new grudges intertwined, making his hatred burn his soul, almost grinding his teeth to pieces.

The accumulated Anger-Slaying Sword Intent within him became increasingly condensed, and his killing intent grew fierce.

In the Divine霄 Palace.

The Attribute Panel in Xu Yunfan's vision clearly captured the torrent of hatred and curses transmitted from Han Shi's soul link.

However, his divine sense remained as calm as an ancient, undisturbed well, completely unaffected.

Han Shi's anger was just a trivial noise signal in his test of this Profound Mirror.

His entire attention was focused on the massive amount of information being fed back to the panel regarding the operating status of the Reverse Fate Profound Mirror as Han Shi delved deeper into the Netherworld passage.

‘Crack expansion path analysis: Concentrated at the intersection node of the dragon-scale patterns on the lower left of the mirror surface.’

‘North冥玄 Crystal energy output shows a 0.07-second delay at spatial-temporal turbulence peak points.’

‘When death qi concentration exceeds the threshold, the simulated "True Spirit Return to Void" illusion shows a 0.3% deviation.’

‘The buffering efficiency of the Soul-Nourishing Wood Heart against soul shock is 12.8% lower than the expected value.’

Xu Yunfan's mind operated at high speed, combining the ancient texts on life-and-death reincarnation and reversing fate that he had consulted in the Primordial Origin Sect's library, with the fragmented, cryptic yet full of ingenious and fantastical ideas from the notes left behind by the Nine Nether True Lord from a hundred thousand years ago.

He quickly compared, calculated, and deduced.

The path the Nine Nether True Lord walked back then was the Nine Nether Dao of controlling ghostly beings, which was indeed vastly different from the Life-and-Death Dao displayed by the current White-Haired True Lord, who seemed to reverse life and death.

This huge difference made Xu Yunfan harbor a subtle, hard-to-detect suspicion about whether the White-Haired True Lord was truly a traitor of the Primordial Origin Sect.

What Pudu True Lord said was questionable.

What made him even more vigilant was that the waters of the Taihua Spirit Void Realm were likely far deeper than the three major sects on the surface. There were probably many existences like the White-Haired True Lord, perhaps hidden in some unknown corner.

"The key is the energy conduction lag of the North冥玄 Crystals. The combination of the patterns on the scale nodes needs to be optimized to disperse the shearing force. The age of the Soul-Nourishing Wood Heart is still insufficient; its resistance to the erosion of death qi from the core region of the Sea of Bitterness is not enough..."

Xu Yunfan thought to himself, noting down each defect and the corresponding direction for optimization.

The value of Han Shi entering the Netherworld lay precisely here.

After all, using an avatar, he could feel the changes at all times, which was of great use to him in comprehending the heavens and earth and studying life and death.

Life and death are both Yin and Yang.

This could harmonize the dragon and tiger within his body, practice the mutual nourishment of Yin and Yang, and be greatly beneficial to transforming the circulation of the Zhou Tian.

‘Your Daoist attainment has increased.’

Xu Yunfan saw the information prompts constantly refreshing on his vision, and amidst them, this line of green text made him feel satisfied.
