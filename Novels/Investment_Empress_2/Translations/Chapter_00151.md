# Chapter 151: Li Mo's First God Observation Cultivation (1/2)

Looking at the unfamiliar yet familiar girl in the painting, Ying Bing was momentarily dazed.

What was she doing in her previous life at this time?

Every day, she endured the torment of extreme cold, wandering the dark Qingyuan Mountain Range, searching for the Xiapo that was calling to her from the void.

One by one, those with malicious intentions and the ravenous wild beasts fell beneath her sword.

Those memories were filled with darkness, coldness, and desolation.

But tonight, the moonlight was truly beautiful.

She looked at the smiling self in the painting.

The clear brilliance of the moonlight flowed.

A seed, planted in the solid ice at some unknown time, seemed to be quietly taking root and sprouting...

"Tsk, I'm awesome."

Li Mo couldn't help but puff out his chest, the corners of his mouth curling up, almost wanting to put his hands on his hips.

Who said artists must pass away to become famous?

If this painting were hung on Ruyi Peak, it would instantly become a masterpiece!

He had already thought of a name—Mona Ice!

"Eh?"

Shang舞 carefully examined it a few times and suddenly blinked her almond-shaped eyes in surprise:

"This painting seems to have a bit of the meaning of a God Observation Painting?"

"Is that so?"

Li Mo looked carefully and indeed found that it had that kind of unique charm.

It was just a bit faint.

It was probably because his final few strokes were unintentional, pouring his mind and spirit into it?

No wonder he felt so exhausted after finishing the painting...

"It can't be called a God Observation Painting, that's too much of a stretch. It can only be said to use a similar painting technique."

Shang舞 smacked her lips, a bit regretfully.

She could see that this painting barely counted as 'Lower Form'.

"Can portraits also be used for God Observation?"

Li Mo couldn't help but ask.

Shang舞 snorted:

"Of course. What do you think the Great Yu Imperial Family observes?"

"The sun..."

Li Mo remembered that two of the suns were once Great Yu Emperors.

"There are two types of using a person's divine charm as an object of observation."

"One is observing a Sage who carries the 'Dao', and the other is the Demon Summoning Heresy of the Demon Summoning Sect. This painting counts as neither and cannot be used for observation at all."

Shang舞 had a deep understanding of God Observation Paintings.

It was unknown if this was related to her当初 smashing a pile of statues.

"What a pity."

Li Mo rolled up the scroll and sighed:

"This was just a flash of inspiration. I don't know when I'll have such a perfect combination of timing, place, and people again."

"You will."

"Huh?"

Li Mo was stunned.

He saw Ying Bing already turning around and ascending the pavilion, leaving only a silhouette.

...

Night gradually deepened.

After soaking in the hot springs, Li Mo also returned to his room.

The daily practice session could not be skipped.

Now that the "Karma Fire Red Lotus Wonder Method" had condensed the Profound Pill, it still needed to accumulate Primordial Qi, and he didn't intend to condense just one Profound Pill.

"Ice Cube's room doesn't seem as cold as before."

Passing by the隔壁 door, Li Mo felt something.

At this time, Ying Bing should be observing the Moon.

Perhaps this was because she had already embarked on the path of God Observation?

Li Mo shook his head and walked into his room.

He casually placed the painting he just made by his side, then took out the Golden Crow Transforming Sun God Observation Painting from the system space.

He stared at the Golden Crow Transforming Sun Painting for a long time, but there was no reaction whatsoever.

"My Primordial Body, ordinary internal energy martial arts are unusable, could it be the same for God Observation Paintings?"

"No..."

Li Mo spread out the 'Mona Ice' again.

This time, that feeling of his spirit being tugged appeared once more.

The painting depicting Ice Cube was barely considered 'Lower Form', yet it could resonate with his soul.

While the 'Extreme Form' Golden Crow Transforming Sun Painting could not.

Little Li was thoughtful.

It has nothing to do with the grade of the God Observation Painting?

---

Unfortunately.

This painting cannot be observed...

"Wait!"

"I have the Creation Seal!"

"Since this was painted using the God Observation Painting technique, what would happen if I stamped the Creation Seal on it?"

Little Li Genius had a flash of inspiration.

*Swish*—Two seals made of Profound Copper, with an ancient and extraordinary design, appeared on the table.

He still had two Ancient Copper Creation Seals.

Even if it failed, he had room for error!

"Give it a try?"

Li Mo's mind was still thinking.

But his hand seemed to have its own ideas, slapping the seal onto the painting.

*Hummm*—

The profound characters merged into it.

Instantly, a hazy light appeared on the surface of the painting, enveloping the entire picture and flowing over it.

"It works!"

Li Mo stared intently, his heart in his throat.

Would anything go wrong?

Fortunately, his worries were unnecessary.

The light gradually faded.

One painting had become two.

The original one was still there, but a new one had appeared beside it.

Li Mo looked closely.

He saw that the person in the painting was still Ice Cube, still with that pure and stunning beauty, but slightly different from before.

She was no longer a sixteen-year-old girl; she seemed to have grown up a bit, losing her youthful greenness.

Her clothes had also changed, from a snow-white long dress to black gauze.

Time had made her figure more exquisite, her eyes deeper, like a phantom wandering in the night.

Unchanged was the corner of her lips, slightly raised.

If Ying Bing saw this painting, she would recognize it.

This was her appearance when she was traveling in the Jianghu. At that time, she was already ranked first on the Hidden Dragon List within the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths' Fengyun List, with the title Cold King of Hell.

"This is... Ice Cube's future appearance?"

Li Mo was momentarily stunned.

Why did it feel like playing a dress-up养成 game...

Moreover.

This painting seemed to have been deduced to 'Middle Form'?

To verify his conjecture, Li Mo sank his mind into it.

Suddenly.

Everything before his eyes rippled like water waves, becoming unreal.

The cold moon, the dark alley, the girl holding a sword and looking back.

In an instant, Li Mo seemed to be standing opposite her, becoming her opponent.

This was similar to the time he fought with the lingering will in the Red Sky Sword in the Divine Peak Cave.

The difference was.

The Ice Cube in the painting was infinitely more powerful.

*Clang*—

Frost reflected the cold moon as the sword was drawn.

This sword light was breathtakingly beautiful, to the extreme, as if everything around had stagnated.

Including thought.

A long time passed.

Or perhaps it was just an instant.

Li Mo's soul separated from the form and meaning of the painting, his chest heaving slightly.

"Judging by Ice Cube's age, this should be her not-too-distant future, right?"

Little Li's mind was stirred.

He could deeply perceive that one of the swords was 'No Self', the moonlight dazzling and captivating...

It wasn't just because the Ice Cube in the painting was strong.

Also!

This painting did not shatter after he observed it!

"The Ancient Copper Creation Seal can at most deduce a God Observation Painting to 'Upper Form'."

"If I stamp it again, would this painting become 'Upper Form'?"

Li Mo pondered for a moment.

He hadn't observed the divine charm yet.

Let's try this Ice Cube first.

Little Li began to attempt his first-ever God Observation.
