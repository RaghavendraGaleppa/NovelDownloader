# Chapter 143: Radiance Immortal Realm

"Here?"

Zhang Jing surveyed his surroundings and found the location indeed ideal—utterly tranquil and brimming with dense immortal spiritual energy. It was perfect for cultivation.

He turned to Feng Wuyu with a smile and nodded lightly. "Thank you, Senior Brother. This place will do."

"Haha, excellent choice, Junior Brother!" Feng Wuyu's face broke into a meaningful smile upon Zhang Jing's agreement.

With a casual wave of his hand, bronze divine light swept across a specific area ahead. Instantly, the void rippled with folds before abruptly revealing a gurgling spiritual spring. Crystal-clear treasure liquid continuously surged forth, causing the immortal spiritual energy in the area to rapidly intensify at an astonishing rate.

"Senior Brother, what is this?" Zhang Jing pointed at the suddenly appearing spring, astonished.

"Haha, this is a channel through which the grotto-heaven refines chaos to produce immortal spiritual energy. We call it a spiritual spring—a specialty of grotto-heavens. I discovered it three thousand years ago, but by then the immortal island had already been established and couldn't be relocated. I had no choice but to conceal it to prevent the Celestial Court faction from benefiting. Now, it's perfect as one of my congratulatory gifts for your joining the Crimson Radiance Great Luminescence Grotto-Heaven."

"Many thanks for Senior Brother's kindness," Zhang Jing expressed his gratitude promptly.

"No need for formalities between us, Junior Brother. As members of the Nine Domains faction, we should look out for each other. By the way, you can take out your Crimson Seal now. Activate it with your divine sense while silently reciting its location in your mind," Feng Wuyu urged.

Following his instructions, Zhang Jing produced the crimson stone seal and gently activated it with his divine sense.

Boom!

A thunderous sound erupted as light vanished from the surrounding hundreds of zhang. Black cracks began appearing in space, from which wisps of gray energy emerged. Under some mysterious force, this energy transformed into earth, stone, and sand, gradually coalescing into an immortal island.

The island expanded outward relentlessly, forcing Zhang Jing to retreat quickly. As time passed, the dark spatial fissures disappeared one by one, revealing an irregularly shaped circular island spanning five thousand li. It boasted crisscrossing mountain ranges, plains, forests, valleys, and rivers.

At the center of the island, within a valley, a spiritual spring quietly formed, instantly expanding into a small lake that exuded extraordinarily rich immortal spiritual energy.

By the spiritual spring on the immortal island, Feng Wuyu and Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on the ground. A trace of urgency flickered across Feng Wuyu's face.

"Junior Brother, I must leave the grotto-heaven for a matter, so I'll be brief. Listen carefully."

"Please speak, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied earnestly.

After a moment's thought to organize his words, Feng Wuyu began:

"First, your white deer mount likely carries the bloodline of the innate sacred beast Nine-Colored Deer. Probably one of its ancestors gave birth while inadvertently sensing a remnant dao imprint left by a Nine-Colored Deer. Such occurrences are rare but not unheard of."

"The Nine-Colored Divine Light inheritance is housed in the Dao Repository Secret Realm. You might consider exchanging it for cultivation later—it could become a valuable assistant in the future."

"Thank you for the advice, Senior Brother. But this Dao Repository Secret Realm..." Zhang Jing's expression turned puzzled.

Feng Wuyu smiled. "This leads to what I was about to tell you—the most important matter: the Radiance Immortal Realm! Master must have granted you access."

Zhang Jing nodded slowly.

"The Radiance Immortal Realm is a special world created by one of our Primordial Limitless Dao Gate's founding ancestors. It exists between being and non-being, vast and mysterious beyond measure. It serves as the primary cultivation ground for tens of thousands of Dao Gate disciples."

"The Dao Repository Secret Realm resides within it. By spending destiny points, you can exchange for numerous inheritances of the Primordial Dao Gate."

"As for destiny points, you can think of them as your academy's merit points, but their profundity far surpasses them. From what I know, at Master's level, destiny points become the most crucial resource!"

"The projection descent to lower realms I mentioned earlier also occurs in the Radiance Immortal Realm and requires destiny points."

"In short, all your future cultivation will revolve around the Radiance Immortal Realm! That's all for now—the rest you'll discover yourself. Remember, destiny points are paramount. Don't squander them recklessly!"

With that, Feng Wuyu rose to leave. Zhang Jing quickly stood up, expressing heartfelt gratitude: "Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother!"

Yet before the words fully left his mouth, Feng Wuyu turned back. Reaching into his armpit, he pulled out a three-foot-long bronze chain and handed it to Zhang Jing.

"Junior Brother, that spiritual spring was a last-minute thought. This Immortal-Binding Chain was the gift I originally prepared for you. Keep it."

"Though with your current cultivation, even with my help, refining it would be too difficult. Wait until you reach Golden Core or Dharma Form stage."

"Oh, and fellow disciples from our Nine Domains faction will likely visit you soon. Interacting with them won't hurt—you can ask them any questions."

Feng Wuyu dispensed these final pieces of advice like an elder seeing off a junior. "Understood, Senior Brother. My thanks," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.

"Very well, I'll take my leave now."

---

Time flowed quietly. Deer Thirty-Eight had fully recovered and was now frenetically patrolling the immortal island. Zhang Jing paid the creature no mind.

During this period, he used magic to construct a small palace beside the spiritual spring. Though not luxurious, it sufficed—at least he no longer needed to sleep under the open sky.

One day, seated on his meditation cushion, Zhang Jing slowly closed his eyes to contemplate the cultivation essentials of the Primordial World Creation Path imparted by True Monarch Yuanming.

To walk the World Creation Path, the Primordial Dao Foundation required fusing thirty-six dao concepts during the Foundation Establishment stage, encompassing attributes like yin-yang, five elements, wind, thunder, and marsh. Upon breaking through to Golden Core, one could condense the supreme divine ability—Primordial Genesis Immortal Light.

At the Golden Core stage, one needed to incorporate all 365 foundational dao concepts of the Dao Gate's complete celestial cycle into the Primordial Genesis Golden Core, thereby condensing nine additional supreme divine abilities.

"Tsk—" 

Zhang Jing couldn't help drawing a sharp breath. Just the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivation methods already made his scalp tingle.

After steadying himself, he exhaled slowly. No wonder his teacher, a Heavenly Immortal True Monarch, repeatedly emphasized the extreme difficulty of achieving success through the Primordial World Creation Path.

Yet—

Zhang Jing recalled the description of the Primordial Genesis Immortal Light from his teacher's instructions: "With but a thought, it can cleave void and give birth to earth, fire, wind, and water."

The path might be arduous, but its power was undeniable. Who wouldn't be tempted?

Moreover, with the mysterious jade talisman and the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dao Seed enhancing him, the World Creation Path didn't seem entirely impossible for Zhang Jing.

After a long while, Zhang Jing opened his eyes, his gaze crystal clear.

"The 365 foundational dao concept inheritances and the various great daos of the immortal gate all reside in the Dao Repository Secret Realm of the Radiance Immortal Realm? In that case, I should visit the Radiance Immortal Realm."

With this thought, a chaotic-colored dao mark slowly appeared between Zhang Jing's eyebrows.

In that instant, he sensed it clearly—whenever he wished, he could enter that vast, unimaginable world.
