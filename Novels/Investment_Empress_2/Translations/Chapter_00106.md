Chapter 106: Lingerie?

The hotpot restaurant's doors were tightly shut.

"The martial arts you used seem to originate from the Tianshan Sword Manor?" Qian Bufan asked, his broad experience allowing him to identify the style. He picked up a slice of beef. I have to say, where did Disciple Li get this hotpot recipe? It smells quite good.

"Yes," Mei Yun did not deny it.

Although she did not state it explicitly, her identity was already made clear to everyone. Mei Jian, one of the Four Sword Maidens of Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum, once ranked 41st on the Earth List of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. She later voluntarily left the Tianshan Sword Manor.

"I am Qian Bufan, an Outer Affairs Elder of the Qingyuan Sect."

Qian Bufan introduced everyone one by one, including Shang Wu.

Upon hearing Shang Wu's name, Mei Yun looked at the woman in palace robes who was currently boiling mutton slices, her gaze shifting slightly.

After a moment of silence, she spoke: "Everyone here is a figure of great importance in the Eastern Wilderness Domain."

"I will tell you everything I know and am allowed to say."

Qian Bufan picked up a piece of bamboo shoot, scanned the expressions of the others, and then nodded. "We are all ears."

"The reason the Drizzle Building established a branch here, I do not know, but it likely has no connection to the Demon Summoning Sect."

"The magistrate surnamed Cui was collaborating with the Demon Summoning Sect on his own initiative."

Demon Summoning Sect.

Upon hearing these three words, everyone's expression turned grave.

"What does the Demon Summoning Sect want to do?" the middle-aged man in a Confucian robe from the Burning Jade Forest asked.

"They have discovered a Blood Phoenix Secret Realm."

As these words fell, it was like a massive stone was thrown into a calm lake.

Qian Bufan sucked in a cold breath, accidentally inhaling a piece of rice tofu along with the air.

Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

Legend has it that the Blood Phoenix was formed from one of the nine souls of the Multicolored Primordial Phoenix. It is immortal and indestructible; every time it dies, it can undergo a miraculous rebirth.

Every time it dies and is rebirthed, its old body falls, creating a Blood Phoenix Secret Realm at the place of its fall. Thus, these secret realms are not unique.

There might be exaggeration in this, after all, the true Blood Phoenix has long since vanished without a trace for countless years. However, countless strong experts still flock to it like ducks.

Immortality and indestructibility.

What a hauntingly beautiful term.

Could the barren Eastern Wilderness Domain also be the resting place of a fallen Blood Phoenix?

"The location is in Qinghe County. That is all I know."

"Unfortunately, the Uninterrupted Trial ended early. I do not know any more details," Mei Yun said softly.

Qian Bufan and the others exchanged glances.

Qinghe County?

The middle-aged man from the Burning Jade Forest, his eyes suddenly lit up.

Qinghe County is very close to their Burning Jade Forest.

However...

Well, closeness is useless. Judging by everyone's expressions, it is obvious that no one cares about the distance.

"Unfortunately, the members of the Demon Summoning Sect and the Drizzle Building are all dead..."

"That is not necessarily the case," Mei Yun shook her head.

"The top three of the Uninterrupted Trial are still alive."

"Who are the three? I will go capture them!"

"I shall go. My Burning Jade Forest is very good at persuading people with reason. I will make sure they tell us everything they know."

"Li Mo, Ying Bing, Xiao Qin."

"......"

The Inner Landscape experts all looked at Elder Qian with suspicion.

Wait.

Your Qingyuan Sect... surely you don't have some strategic cooperation with the Drizzle Building?

Otherwise, how could the top three all be your disciples?!

"What exactly did they do?" Qian Bufan's expression was strange. He asked you to come to the Prefecture City to maintain order and strictly prevent the Drizzle Building from causing chaos.

He didn't ask you to join them directly!

He didn't know exactly what had happened in the Prefecture City, so he could only turn to Shang Wu: "Weren't they running a hotpot restaurant?"

"That's right. Look at how good the business is downstairs. They are using this method to gather intelligence," Shang Wu said nonchalantly.

The Inner Landscape experts: "..."

It seems they now understand why the Uninterrupted Trial ended early.

"Speaking of which, if they hadn't及时 informed Elder Shang Wu, it might have been too late by the time we arrived," Qian Bufan said seriously, taking a bite of duck intestine to show that the Qingyuan Sect's stance was absolutely correct.

"My Qingyuan Sect will also reward them for their merits."

He was thinking quite comprehensively. If the Drizzle Building still has designs on the Ziyang Prefecture in the future, having Li Mo and the others there would allow them to grasp the situation immediately.

***

"Ying Bing cut down a杀手 at the Observation of the Divine Realm. That is truly not easy," the middle-aged man in the Confucian robe from the Burning Jade Forest spoke.

Cutting down an Observation of the Divine Realm expert with Inner Qi?

The gap between Inner Qi and Observation of the Divine Realm is much larger than that between the Blood Qi Realm and the Inner Qi Realm.

Many geniuses who were outstanding in the Blood Qi Realm find it difficult to even maintain a draw against opponents who are one realm higher than them once they reach the Inner Qi Realm.

Everyone discussed some more details and agreed to keep in touch before picking up their chopsticks.

"We've talked for so long, I'm starving."

"Let's eat."

"After eating, I still need to report back to the sect... hmm?"

"Where are the dishes?"

...

"Golden Crow Transforming the Sun Visualization."

"Was the sun of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands in the past formed by the Golden Crow?"

Li Mo pondered this, looking up at the sky.

Even though he is still at the Inner Qi Realm, he still finds the three suns too dazzling to look at directly.

For ordinary people, it is just overly bright.

But Li Mo, having followed Shang Wu, has初步 grasped 'Intent', and immediately felt a dry, scorching sensation deep in his soul.

He couldn't look at it for long.

Li Mo quickly averted his gaze.

He doesn't know which visualization maps are precious among the ones he has.

But undoubtedly, the Golden Crow Transforming the Sun Visualization he possesses must be one of the top-tier ones.

After all, it dropped from Princess Jiang Chulong.

It is much stronger than the Night Ghost Visualization he has.

Unfortunately, he can't use it yet.

"It has to wait until the Observation of the Divine Realm."

Li Mo felt that wouldn't take long.

In the System Space, he took out a stone pot containing a stream of azure liquid.

Green Wood Spirit Liquid.

The vitality contained within could save him a lot of hard work in the process of condensing Qi into liquid.

...

Time flies like a white pony passing through a gap.

During these ten days.

During the day, Li Mo taught Jiang Chulong and Mei Yun how to run a hotpot restaurant.

He accidentally discovered that among the few property deeds he obtained in the Qingyuan Sect,这家店 was included.

Meaning, Student Li had already been the boss of this shop a long time ago.

Oh, destiny...

Since the shop was just sitting there anyway.

Li Mo simply handed the hotpot recipe to Jiang Chulong and let Mei Yun settle down here with the little ones.

He practiced martial arts in the afternoon and dual-cultivated at night.

With the help of the Ice Cube, his progress in the Inner Qi Realm was gratifying.

Finally, on the evening of the tenth day, he successfully refined the thirty-six lotus seeds until only one remained, which then took root and sprouted.

Student Li became an Inner Qi Realm martial artist.

The dual cultivation also came to a temporary end.

The process of condensing Qi into a pill, the interference of the foreign Qi, might lead to impurities in the Xuan Dan.

...

Time entered June, and midsummer arrived quietly.

This morning.

When Ying Bing woke up, she subconsciously wanted to remove the arm draped over her neck, but grasped nothing but air.

She then realized.

Since yesterday, they hadn't been sleeping together.

It had been a month.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully completing the First Loser's Punishment.】

【Third Tier Reward Issued: True Phoenix Feather.】

【Evaluating completion degree...】

【Completion: 100%.】

【Rating: Ding (Lowest), only Ding-level additional reward can be given.】

Completing the Loser's Punishment would yield an additional reward—this was something Ying Bing already knew.

But what does Ding-level mean?

She knows what the True Phoenix Feather is; she obtained it in her previous life as well.

So Ying Bing was actually a bit curious about the additional reward.

"I clearly followed the system's requirements to complete the punishment, yet the rating is so low."

"Ding-level... better than nothing. I wonder if I can make use of it..."

Ying Bing checked the reward栏.

【Randomly抽取 Ding-level reward.】

【Congratulations, Host, for obtaining one piece of Lingerie.】

Ying Bing: "?"

Lingerie, what is that?

What a strange term.
