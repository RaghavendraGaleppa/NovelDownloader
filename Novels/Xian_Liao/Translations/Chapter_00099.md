# Chapter 99: Only Heaven and Earth Are Worthy Opponents

At the foot of Taihe Mountain.

"Brother Zhang, what happened?" Zhou Qing could see that with the aid of elixirs, Zhang Jingxiu had reached the second level of body refinement, his qi and blood surging powerfully.

Yet now he appeared extremely disheveled, with scratch marks on his body. Despite his formidable recovery ability as a Xiantian master, faint traces of blood still emanated from his wounds.

Zhang Jingxiu said solemnly, "This demon is troublesome. We must be careful."

He carefully described the characteristics of the Ghost Claw Vine—its main body entwined around trees, capable of spreading wings, with ghostly claws resembling eagle talons.

"It can fly?"

Now Zhou Qing understood why Zhang Jingxiu was so wary.

"It must have parasitized an eagle-like demon beast and almost completely fused with it. Now the great pine tree is heavily influenced by it, its evil aura growing stronger. And beware of the pine tree's shadow."

Zhou Qing's heart sank. It seemed these wood-attribute spirits and demons could not only parasitize Xiantian masters but also demon beasts, even plundering their innate abilities.

From Zhang Jingxiu's further description, the great pine tree's shadow was not to be underestimated either. The shadow could expand its range, becoming viscous and sprouting tentacle-like appendages. Zhang Jingxiu had to exert considerable effort to break free.

Clearly, the great pine tree had already colluded with the Ghost Claw Vine.

Even without encountering it yet, Zhou Qing was certain the Ghost Claw Vine was the most powerful demon he had faced so far.

"Have you tried the ballista?" Zhou Qing asked.

"The Ghost Claw Vine is very alert. Once the ballista enters its range, it attacks from the sky. Moreover, the pine cones on the great pine tree are still there, nearly ripe. I suspect they're extraordinary and don't want to damage the tree for now."

Zhou Qing understood—this was indeed a case of hesitating to act for fear of harming something valuable. Zhang Jingxiu's urgency in seeking him out was precisely for this reason. The Ghost Claw Vine needed to be dealt with, and he also wanted the pine cones, but alone, Old Zhang couldn't achieve both.

Zhang Jingxiu had also prepared a great bow for Zhou Qing, the finest from the Qinghe Prince's armory, a legendary ten-stone bow passed down from the Great Zhou's founding emperor, with terrifying power.

"The Ghost Claw Vine is very alert. I wonder if you can hit it with this bow."

Zhou Qing tested the bowstring. Drawing it empty-handed produced a tremendous recoil that nearly unbalanced him.

"A fine bow. If I were still at the second level of body refinement, I wouldn't be able to draw it at all."

Legend had it that the Great Zhou's founding emperor, born with divine strength, had used this bow only three times in his life. After the third time, he soon fell ill and died. The Qinghe Prince was his descendant.

Two years ago, Zhou Qing would have struggled with this bow. Now, it felt like a monkey wielding the Ruyi Jingu Bang—perfectly suited.

The bow was named "Thunderbolt," and its arrows were forged from black iron. Zhou Qing tested two shots to get a feel for its accuracy.

"Let's go."

"Not going to practice more?"

Zhou Qing said, "A good bow doesn't need much practice. Please tell Brother Yuan that this will serve as Mingyue's tuition."

"Tuition" referred to the customary gift given to a teacher upon first meeting. But if Zhou Qing wanted it, it had to be given. In fact, many people now wished to present gifts to Zhou Qing but couldn't get them into his hands.

When these words reached Prince Qinghe Yuan Hua's ears, he would only feel pleased—it was a sign of closeness.

"Good, let's head up the mountain."

...

As the sun set in the west, Taihe Mountain was dyed blood-red. The great pine tree still stood on the rocky platform halfway up the mountain, its shadow vast like a black lake, with a tendency to spread in all directions.

The Ghost Claw Vine rested on the pine tree like an eagle, absorbing the bloody sunlight like a black hole. The mountain wind stirred the pine, and ripples formed on the shadowy black lake.

Zhou Qing estimated the distance—eighty-one zhang.

Drawing the bow, nocking the arrow, aiming—all in one fluid motion.

The bowstring twanged like thunder. A murderous, icy, and ferocious aura spread out.

The Ghost Claw Vine was nearly pierced, but the black iron arrow still grazed off a large number of vine leaves.

Zhou Qing closed in like lightning. The Ghost Claw Vine let out a piercing shriek, calling for the great pine tree's help. But when Zhou Qing released his qi and blood, the pine tree swayed violently as if caught in a fierce struggle.

It did not heed the Ghost Claw Vine's call.

The vine was stunned. It spread its wings.

Zhou Qing drew his iron sword, sending a flurry of sword shadows piercing through the air with sharp whistles, raining down on the Ghost Claw Vine.

The vine retaliated with its claws.

Sword met claw.

The Ghost Claw Vine was instantly struck by a tremendous force, sent reeling back onto the pine tree.

Tiger's Roar! Thunder's Voice!

Soul Suppression!

"Hold it!" Zhou Qing commanded.

The great pine tree instinctively obeyed, its branches entangling the Ghost Claw Vine.

The vine radiated disbelief, unable to comprehend why its ally would heed a human's command. But the pine tree didn't exert its full strength, only instinctively obeying Zhou Qing under the influence of his Soul Suppression.

Zhang Jingxiu, watching from nearby, found this utterly astonishing.

The Ghost Claw Vine was surprised, and so was Zhang Jingxiu.

The Taihe Sect had nurtured the great pine tree for centuries, yet its shadow still attacked Zhang Jingxiu. Yet with a single command from Zhou Qing, the pine tree instinctively obeyed?

By the end of July, the pine cones finally ripened. Zhou Qing, who had been eyeing them for a long time, discovered that they had an effect on him similar to what Marrow-Cleansing Pills had on ordinary martial artists.

The mulberries from the Great Mulberry Tree were soul fruits that benefited the Health Preserving Master, while the pine cones from the great pine tree targeted the physical body. Even for someone at the third level of body refinement like him, the slight effect was remarkable given his current cultivation.

Zhou Qing thought of the Tantric Ming Wang, a powerful ghost deity cultivated by the Tantric sect. If Zhang Jingxiu couldn't handle it this time, Zhou Qing would personally intervene, bringing the Ming Wang back for the Great Mulberry Tree to "taste," hoping it might yield new soul fruits.

Soon, it was time to depart for the Tantric Great Snow Mountain's Diamond Monastery. This battle was highly sensational—the Diamond Monastery intended to establish the Tantric sect's dominance and had invited leaders of various factions to witness the event.

After all, Zhang Jingxiu had issued the challenge and arrogantly set the location at the Diamond Monastery on Great Snow Mountain. This was also an opportunity to show the Central Plains' heroes that the Snow Region had its own formidable figures.

With Zhang Jingxiu's victory, the Snow Region sought to expand its influence in the grasslands. Since the most fearsome figure in the Central Plains was Zhou Qing, and the Snow Region's Ming Wang, once leaving the Diamond Monastery, would no longer be bound by the monastery's masters, they naturally dared not let the Ming Wang venture out. Thus, Zhou Qing remained an insurmountable mountain for them.

The battle with the Taihe Sect's Zhang Jingxiu was both to settle grudges and to seize the chance to infiltrate the grassland tribes. After all, the Snow Region's people had already been offered as sacrifices to the ghost deities. The masters needed new "human offerings."

The grasslands and the tribes of the Far West were the Snow Region's expansion targets. Since they couldn't penetrate the Central Plains, they turned their spears elsewhere.

Before departure, Xiao Ruowang returned to Taihe Mountain, concerned for his master.

"Brother Xiao, no need to worry. If necessary, I will intervene."

Zhang Jingxiu's face reddened. "Rest assured, this time I won't let you step in."

Zhou Qing said leisurely, "I hope so. I'll return to Jiangzhou to fetch Morning Sun and then head to Great Snow Mountain again, taking the opportunity to visit the temple enshrining 'Vairocana Buddha.'"

"Can you make it back in time?"

Zhou Qing leaped into the air, riding the clouds as a faint Daoist chant drifted through the sky. "Don't worry. I might even reach Great Snow Mountain before you."

"Zhou Qingzhi is good in every way, except he's a bit like Fu Song—he loves to show off," Zhang Jingxiu muttered to his disciple.

Xiao Ruowang didn't reply, gazing wistfully in the direction Zhou Qing had left. What young man could resist the allure of soaring through the heavens?

Zhou Qing's departure on the clouds—how enviable!

But when this punch halted, a stone tablet not far away shattered with a boom.

Zhou Qing narrowed his eyes slightly. Zhang Jingxiu's punch just now had been inwardly focused, serene and empty, executed with an indescribable ease and freedom, yet also seemingly "selfless," impossible to grasp.

"Let me try again?"

Zhou Qing nodded.

Zhang Jingxiu threw the same punch. This time, Zhou Qing blocked it, but he was still surprised—this punch had been entirely countered by his third-level body refinement instincts, relying on faster reflexes and greater strength.

"This is a kind of 'fist intent,'" Zhang Jingxiu said after a long moment of reflection.

"Fist intent?"

Zhang Jingxiu nodded. "Just now, I suddenly felt as if I didn't exist—only a unique martial intent filled me. Your divine sense could perceive my fist technique but couldn't penetrate my fist intent. This could also be called the 'formless' realm in martial arts. Without form, no matter how powerful your divine sense, it can't be deciphered. You countered it with sheer force just now."

Zhou Qing nodded. "Indeed, it was pure force. Brother, you're truly a martial arts genius."

Zhang Jingxiu found Zhou Qing's praise somewhat odd. Normally, wouldn't such words come from an elder to a junior? It made him feel like the junior.

Zhou Qing continued sparring with Zhang Jingxiu, helping him refine his fist intent—a blend of extreme softness and hardness, based on the Eight Trigrams Palm, harmonizing yin and yang.

Zhang Jingxiu named it "Eight Trigrams Taiji Fist."

Zhou Qing felt that mastering this fist intent would benefit him greatly. Yet strangely, despite his superior divine sense and body refinement, he couldn't develop his own "fist intent."

"I think fist intent is related to temperament—it contains a sense of one's innate nature. Though I'm inferior to you in many ways, I might have a better grasp of my innate nature."

"Innate nature?"

Zhang Jingxiu said, "You're a born cultivator, but your path has been too smooth. Our Daoist tradition says, 'A spirit unrefined through myriad trials cannot attain sainthood.' The bald monks of Buddhism also say, 'Without tempering, there is no enlightenment.' Innate nature is like jade hidden within stone—without carving and polishing, how can its true form be revealed?"

Zhou Qing replied, "I understand your meaning, but my progress hasn't stalled yet. I'm not at the point where I need to deliberately temper myself. If I must, it would be through battling heaven and earth."

Zhou Qing had an idea—cultivating amidst ocean tides. The deeper one dived, the greater the pressure, offering unparalleled tempering for the body.

But comprehending Zhang Jingxiu's fist intent wasn't so simple. The phrase "see one's nature" was easy to say but hard to achieve. Zhang Jingxiu's fist intent was merely a glimpse of it.

True enlightenment of one's nature, akin to a Buddha's, would allow one to perceive heaven and earth, drawing upon the universe's energy for cultivation. Eternal life would be within easy reach.

For such beings, "hearing the Dao in the morning, attaining it by evening" wouldn't be an exaggeration.

But did such terrifying beings exist in the world? If they did, they were beyond Zhou Qing's current imagination.

Zhou Qing knew well that with his Health Preserving Master, he had progressed step by step, focusing on technique rather than the Dao. He was still far from the realm of "Dao."

"At its peak, technique can approach the Dao." Zhou Qing had no regrets—he had simply chosen the path best suited to him.

Yet Zhang Jingxiu's "fist intent" made Zhou Qing realize that the key to breaking through to the third level of body refinement likely lay therein.

After the ninth layer of qi refinement, one could forge a Dao Foundation, known as "Foundation Establishment." What lay beyond the third level of body refinement?

This wasn't mentioned in the maps left by Master Jingyang, the ancient scriptures recording the Formless Heart Method, or the jade left by Qinglingzi.

One thing was certain: breaking through the third level of body refinement was far more difficult than a qi cultivator establishing their foundation.

Between body and qi cultivators lay a hybrid—the sword cultivators.

To become a sword cultivator, one needed a sword that resonated with them (a life-bound sword) and a corresponding sword technique to achieve unity of person and blade.

Qinglingzi mentioned that sword cultivators could perform "sword flight," an extremely fast escape technique that allowed them to vanish without a trace, like a divine dragon "soaring above the clouds, bearing the azure sky."

By late July, the great pine tree's cones finally ripened. Zhou Qing, who had long coveted them, found that they had a slight effect on him akin to Marrow-Cleansing Pills on ordinary martial artists.

The Great Mulberry Tree's berries were soul fruits that benefited the Health Preserving Master, while the pine cones targeted the physical body. Even for someone at the third level of body refinement like Zhou Qing, the minor effect was noteworthy.

Zhou Qing thought of the Tantric Ming Wang, a powerful ghost deity cultivated by the Tantric sect. If Zhang Jingxiu couldn't handle it, Zhou Qing would personally intervene, bringing the Ming Wang back for the Great Mulberry Tree to "taste," hoping for new soul fruits.

Soon, it was time to depart for the Tantric Great Snow Mountain's Diamond Monastery. This battle was highly sensational—the Diamond Monastery sought to establish the Tantric sect's dominance and had invited leaders of various factions to witness the event.
