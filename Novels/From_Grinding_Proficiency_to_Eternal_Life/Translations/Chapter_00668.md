# Chapter 668: The Cultivation Philosophy of the Golden Core Realm

She quipped playfully. Seeing that Xu Yunfan remained unmoved, she retracted her teasing expression and said solemnly, "The primary reason I invited you here today is, naturally, to congratulate you on achieving the Golden Core Realm. The Divine Thunder Dao Fruit has reappeared in the light of day; it is truly a cause for celebration."

She paused, her tone carrying a trace of genuine delight and undisguised sarcasm. "Especially slaying that hypocrite, Qingyuan! It truly vented a thousand years of pent-up hatred for me! Just thinking of his sanctimonious face being blasted apart by your Divine Thunder, his Dao Fruit shattering, and his True Spirit fleeing in disarray into the cycle of reincarnation, I cannot help but applaud in delight! Such a great favor must be repaid."

Looking at the woman's face, which seemed on the verge of dying from sheer excitement, Xu Yunfan understood. It was indeed about Qingyuan. It seemed the grudge between them was quite deep.

Although Xu Yunfan had a strong desire for gossip, he did not dig deeper. Some things were better left unknown, as they only added to one's troubles. He would maintain a relationship of mutual respect and cooperation.

He maintained a calm expression, neither taking credit nor shirking responsibility. "Daoist Qingyuan blocked my path to the Dao and attempted to seize the foundation of my Dao Fruit. When the dagger was finally revealed, I, Xu, had no choice but to fight for my life. Being able to slay him was partly due to luck. I have heard of the old grudge between you and Qingyuan. This time, it was a happy accident that I was able to slightly alleviate your burden."

His words were watertight.

"Fight for your life? Heh, a fine way of putting it." True Monarch Dongming looked at him with a half-smile, her eyes deep, but she did not expose the depth of his scheming. "Regardless, Qingyuan's fall brings me great joy. Divine Thunder True Monarch, you are so young yet possess such means and魄力 (courage); your future is limitless. I invited you today, first to offer congratulations, and second..."

Her tone shifted, her gaze becoming serious and profound. "It is to make your acquaintance. Within the Primordial Origin Sect, there are few True Monarchs who catch my eye, but you are one of them. In the future, there may be opportunities for us to watch out for one another."

With Xu Yunfan's cultivation speed, relying on the accumulation of a single lifetime to enter the Golden Core Realm directly—this was something only the Pure Yang Ancestor of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect achieved a thousand years ago.

Xu Yunfan thought to himself that the "acquaintance" just now was indeed quite "deep." He still wore a polite smile and cupped his hands. "I am honored that True Monarch thinks highly of me. I have just entered the Golden Core Realm and am not yet familiar with many affairs of the sect. If I have any doubts in the future, I will need to consult seniors like you."

After a round of seemingly harmonious but actually self-interested mutual flattery, Xu Yunfan finally steered the conversation toward the issue he was most concerned about. "True Monarch mentioned 'watching out for one another' just now; I am deeply grateful. To be honest, although I was lucky enough to attain the Golden Core, this realm is profound and mysterious. I am at a loss regarding how to cultivate subsequently, how to nurture the Golden Core, evolve the Inner World, and even glimpse higher realms. The sect's classics are vague on these matters, and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect..."

He shook his head. "I suppose True Monarch knows of my awkward situation. Could True Monarch offer some guidance? Where does the path lead after the Golden Core?"

His gaze was burning, filled with sincere desire to learn.

Xu Yunfan was certain that True Monarch Dongming's invitation was not merely to thank him or to sleep with him; she definitely had something to ask. He naturally had to seize the opportunity to make some requests of his own.

A sharp light flashed deep in True Monarch Dongming's eyes, as if she had expected this. She lazily adjusted her posture, her slender fingers tapping lightly on the black jade table, making a crisp sound. A meaningful smile appeared on her face.

"Divine Thunder True Monarch asks a good question. After the Golden Core, the evolution of the Inner World, the natural flow of the Dao, and the secrets involving the origin of heaven and earth are the foundation upon which we True Monarchs stand and the root of our longevity. This is a true oral transmission worth a thousand volumes of family lore..."

She dragged out her tone, her expression showing a hint of difficulty. "These are precious experiences I have spent countless heartbeats, through long years, personally exploring, traversing numerous wrong paths and forks, or even paying a considerable price to comprehend. Divine Thunder True Monarch, what do you think I should exchange them for?"

The dagger was finally revealed.

Xu Yunfan sneered in his heart but remained expressionless on the surface. He knew she would have conditions. He leaned forward slightly, making a gesture of listening attentively, and countered, "What does True Monarch Dongming suggest? Please speak freely. As long as it is within my power and does not violate the fundamental principles of morality, we can certainly discuss it."

He deliberately emphasized "within my power" and "does not violate fundamental morality," both as a statement of position and to draw a bottom line. As for the Divine Martial Realm, it was fine; now that it had accepted the baptism of the Primordial Origin Sect, Xu Yunfan considered his bottom line to be quite flexible.

True Monarch Dongming's smile deepened, seemingly very satisfied with Xu Yunfan's understanding. "Divine Thunder True Monarch is indeed a straightforward person. I do not ask for much; I only need one thing: the detailed coordinates of the Aitira World, and all the information you know about this world."

The Aitira Great World. As expected.

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows slightly. Although he had anticipated this, he was still somewhat surprised. Only Ye Xuan knew about it back then. With Qingyuan True Monarch's selfish nature, he would never have released the coordinates. How did True Monarch Dongming know?

His mind raced, but he suppressed his doubts. Qingyuan True Monarch had been entangled by the three main gods in this world before his death, while Xu Yunfan had harvested the divine essence there and refined his Immortal Golden Nature. Sect Master Zhang Ziyang had indeed said that if they could pull another True Monarch-level existence into the game to stir up a bigger storm, it would be easier to fish in troubled waters.

True Monarch Dongming coming to him voluntarily fit this plan perfectly. Moreover, using this coordinate information—which was not exclusive to him and was destined to attract the covetous eyes of other True Monarchs—to exchange for key guidance on his future path of cultivation was a deal worth making.

He didn't hesitate much and immediately nodded firmly. "Good, it's a deal."

A look of triumph and a trace of appreciation for Xu Yunfan's decisiveness flashed in True Monarch Dongming's eyes. "Excellent!"

She swept her slender hand over the table, and a black jade slip flowing with profound runes appeared before Xu Yunfan. "This contains some of my insights on early-stage Golden Core cultivation, particularly regarding the stabilization of the Inner World, the nurturing of the origin, and the preliminary evolution of the Dao. Divine Thunder True Monarch can take a look first as a down payment. Once you engrave the coordinates and details of the Aitira World on the other side of this slip, I will naturally impart the subsequent, more profound methods, including the key insights on suspending the Inner World high in the mid-stage Golden Core, nurturing the Dao Fruit, and touching upon the secrets of the Nascent Soul."

The Nascent Soul Dao Embryo?

Xu Yunfan selectively ignored the "big pie" True Monarch Dongming offered at the end. It would be quite good if half of the contents in the jade slip were true. As a member of the Primordial Origin Sect, he knew very well that these True Monarchs loved to set traps for people.

He picked up the cool, soul-sucking black jade slip and probed it with his Divine Sense. As expected, while the information inside was not a complete legacy, it pointed directly to the core of early Golden Core cultivation—knowledge he currently craved the most.

Skipping the specific cultivation techniques, Xu Yunfan directly viewed the descriptions on how to use the Golden Core as the core to nurture the embryonic form of the Inner World, how to draw upon the laws of heaven and earth to temper the walls of the Inner World, and how to comprehend the origin to strengthen the Golden Core's Primordial Qi.
