# Chapter Sixteen: Demonic Artifacts

"Damn, what a black heart!" Lu Xu cursed inwardly, feeling speechless.

He understood; the man intended to extort them.

"Ahem, fellow Daoist, He Qing was just a chicken farmer. How much savings could he have? We're all struggling commoners from the lower ranks. We hope you'll be magnanimous!"

Old Man Xu, accustomed to such scenes, understood the other party's meaning. On his perpetually cold old face, he forced a smile that resembled a crumpled chrysanthemum. Taking a few steps forward, he discreetly handed a brocade pouch to the white-robed man, his eyes carrying a hint of plea.

The white-robed man had no reservations; he openly untied the pouch and glanced inside. "Only five spirit stones? Are you trying to bribe a beggar?" Disdain showed in his eyes.

Hearing this, the smile on Old Man Xu's face became even uglier: "This old man didn't have much savings to begin with, and in the past two years, I've almost spent all my spirit stones raising my grandson! The other two fellow Daoists are spiritual farmers; they haven't been farming for many years. One of them even has a spirit stone loan. They truly can't produce many spirit stones!"

"A bunch of paupers!" the white-robed man cursed with some annoyance. Likely realizing he couldn't extract much from these people, he abandoned his plan to make a small fortune. However, he was absolutely unwilling to let them off so easily.

"Twenty spirit stones, you figure it out!" With that, he walked to the courtyard gate and waited.

Old Man Xu didn't argue. He sighed, turned around, and said to Lu Xu and the other man: "Let's go to my room to discuss this!"

In Old Man Xu's room, the three looked at each other, a silence falling between them. No one wanted to speak first. On the surface, Old Man Xu was the wealthiest among the three. Those who knew his background understood he had at least several hundred spirit stones saved. As for Lu Xu, although he had many spirit stones, they couldn't be revealed; he couldn't let others know. The money he'd spent openly in recent years was all small sums. Things like buying pills and magic artifacts were always done after changing his appearance; he didn't dare let anyone know. So, in the perception of the people in the small courtyard, he was a struggling individual burdened by loans. The poorest of the three was naturally Han Erlengzi. He had only been in the market city for just over a year and hadn't saved any spirit stones.

After a while, Old Man Xu spoke first: "Let's not beat around the bush. To be frank, we're still short fifteen spirit stones, and I, this old man, can only contribute five more! In the past, I would have covered all twenty spirit stones, but now I can't. This old man has a grandson to take care of!" After he finished speaking, his gaze fell on Han Erlengzi.

"Erlengzi, what do you say?"

Erlengzi's face flushed crimson upon hearing this, a look of shame on his face: "I really can't produce any spirit stones, at most two!"

Old Man Xu looked at Lu Xu.

Lu Xu nodded: "Then I'll contribute eight."

"Alright, so be it. We're just unlucky and have to accept it!" Old Man Xu nodded.

After the three pooled their spirit stones and handed them to the white-robed man at the door, he laughed heartily and turned to leave.

After spending spirit stones to dispatch the Mo family members, the matter of He Qing's death finally settled down. Lu Xu continued his daily life while also paying attention to Yin Yu's movements, hoping to inquire with her about acquiring some powerful, unconventional items. This woman often went out to hunt demon beasts and wouldn't return for several months. Lu Xu waited for half a year before he finally encountered her once.

After getting information from her, Lu Xu immediately arrived in front of an unremarkable shop in the northeast corner of the market city. Inside the shop, behind the counter, sat an old woman with white hair and a face full of wrinkles. Seeing someone enter, she lethargically raised her head, and her hoarse voice sounded: "Fellow Daoist, how may I help you?"

"I heard that Madam Wu often has 'rare items' flowing out from here. This old man has come specifically for that!" Lu Xu uttered in an aged voice. At this moment, he was disguised as a hunchbacked old man, with an ordinary appearance that attracted no attention.

"Oh, so you're a new customer who's been introduced?" The old woman let out a grating laugh. "Hehehe, this old woman certainly has some collections here. It just depends on whether fellow Daoist dares to buy them!"

"Since I've come all this way, of course I dare to buy. Enough chatter, first show me something to look at!" Lu Xu, in his disguise as the hunchbacked old man, put on a temperamental demeanor.

"Hmph, fellow Daoist had better be able to afford the price! Please follow me!" The old woman snorted coldly, walked out from behind the counter, lifted a curtain, and entered a room in the back. Lu Xu followed.

The room was dark, with only a table in the center and a luminous pearl hanging above, emitting a dim green light. The old woman took out a storage pouch from her robes and lightly shook it. With a "clatter," a pile of items spilled onto the table. Lu Xu immediately felt a chilling, sinister aura wash over him. Among the pile of items on the table were a pitch-black short dagger, a mask in the shape of a malevolent ghost, a bone sword shimmering with bloody light, and various items like jade boxes and chests, whose contents were unknown.

"The Wuluo Blade, refined using demonic secret arts. Each time it's activated, the price is a hundred human lives!" Madam Wu's eerie voice sounded in Lu Xu's ear. Her murky eyes scrutinized Lu Xu. She picked up the pitch-black short dagger and let out a strange, cackling laugh, like an old owl in the dark night: "First, offer the vital blood and souls of a hundred people – youths are best – to nourish the blade's qi with blood. Once the blade's qi is fully accumulated, even a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator will perish under a single strike!"

"That's too troublesome. Give this old man something simpler!" Lu Xu's aged voice rang out.

"Hmph, what's so troublesome about it? Wielding this blade, an early-stage Qi Condensation cultivator can contend with a mid-stage, and a mid-stage can contend with a late-stage. It allows one to fight across realms – how many people dream of such a thing? Furthermore, that blade qi can accumulate in the blade for nine days. If you intend to kill someone, you just need to prepare nine days in advance!"

Seeing that Lu Xu seemed uninterested, Madam Wu chuckled and continued her introductions.

"The Yin Soul Banner, refined primarily with nine female children born at an ominous 'yin year, yin month, yin day, yin hour', supplemented by the souls of ninety-nine ordinary female children under the age of three! This banner is extremely powerful. When used, one must draw upon their own vital blood as a guide and activate it according to the incantation. It can summon nine netherworld evil spirits, each equivalent to a sixth-level Qi Condensation cultivator, to possess the female children."

As Madam Wu introduced it, she gently shook the small banner. Immediately, black light surged from the small banner, which abruptly elongated to human height. The long banner stood there on the ground, its surface fluttering without wind. Faintly, adorable faces of young girls flickered on the banner, emitting giggling sounds.

Madam Wu continued to explain the banner. The refiner used artifact forging methods to refine nine female children into artifacts and seal them within the banner. After being refined by demonic secret arts, the female children would become a semi-corporeal existence, existing between reality and illusion. They would gain a psychic ability, allowing them to sense and connect with the legendary Netherworld. After being nourished with vital blood, they would use themselves as a conduit, commanding the ninety-nine female children's souls to set up a grand formation, drawing down evil spirits from the Netherworld to fight for the one who provided the vital blood. Each time this banner was used, the souls of the ninety-nine female children would be completely consumed and would need to be replenished. However, the combat power of nine sixth-level Qi Condensation cultivators was indeed too tempting, so it was no wonder that someone would refine such an artifact.
