# Chapter 195: The Mystery of the Golden Scale and the Mistress's Joy

Zhou Shijie stood frozen, completely at a loss. It was noon, and the first snow had been falling for several hours, frost gradually forming on the lake surface.

Screams rose and fell.

Cao Shuang, Lin Bei, Yuwen Hou... the elders of various clans had not died, but their fates were miserable. They were almost entirely crippled or half-crippled. Ou Yezi had tried to get a share of the spoils but ended up losing a beloved finger; his forging fire skills were now greatly inferior to before.

"This... this..."

Zhou Shijie gazed foolishly at the street. Seeing Li Xian supporting the Mistress as they walked into the distance, he felt a mix of jealousy and newfound admiration.

"What a terrifying woman. Her schemes and depth of thought, her methods of action. Her ruthlessness is chilling, yet her charm is intoxicating."

A long time passed...

Troops from various clans poured in from all sides of the street. The Cao family's chief elder, Cao Zhengge, arrived fully armed, wearing a silken soft armor and wielding a Black Tiger Vajra Spear.

The Lin, Chu, and Yuwen families were the same. Upon hearing the news, the chief elders of each family immediately mobilized. Layers of government soldiers and clan troops gathered, their momentum even greater than before.

Zhou Shijie couldn't help but admire her even more: "You bunch of useless trash. You've occupied this place for so long, yet you haven't strived for progress, becoming decayed and backward. By the time you lot arrive, the Mistress will have long since departed. What use is having so many people?"

Lin Aoshan had been watching from the sidelines at the Dragon Gate Tower. The elders in the tower knew she had a connection with Li Xian and were afraid that if they targeted Li Xian, she would add unnecessary obstacles. Lin Aoshan held an extremely high seniority, was respected by the entire clan, and had inherited her father's title of Marquis, making her crucial.

Therefore, the Lin family elders secretly used a sedative incense to knock her out and sent her back to the clan. By the time she woke up and heard of the drastic change at the lake, she followed the troops here.

The tragic scene before her was terrifying.

"Nephew Lin Bei!" Lin Aoshan glanced over and saw Lin Bei with his hands and feet severed and his chin sliced off. She cried out in shock.

Cao Zhengge, Lin Houlong, Chu Qiudong, and Yuwen Liang, the chief elders of the four families, had grim expressions. They moved the injured to the Dragon Gate Tower and called for physicians to attend to them.

Once the situation stabilized and their lives were no longer in danger, Lin Houlong asked, "What exactly happened? Taking the Golden Scales in previous years has always been safe and sound. Why is it so tragic this year?"

Cao Shuang and the others were itching in pain, their minds drifting, and found it hard to speak. Lin Bei's chin was cut off, his tongue and mouth disabled, so he couldn't explain clearly either. Yuwen Hou had a jade bead embedded in his tongue, which could shatter at any moment, preventing him from opening his mouth.

The other elders remained silent.

After a while, an elder of the Lin family spoke up: "It was the Broken Sword Mistress... the Golden Scale has been taken by the Broken Sword Mistress." He then detailed the cause and effect of the situation.

"Ah!" Lin Aoshan was startled, her eyes flickering.

"What a formidable Broken Sword Mistress! To dare maim my Cao family elders like this!" Cao Zhengge roared.

Yuwen Liang said, "This Broken Sword Mistress has great abilities. Although she hasn't gone far right now, if we pursue her with all our strength, we might catch up. But with our strength, who could keep her here? I'm afraid we couldn't withstand a single strike from her sword."

Everyone fell silent. Even with a heaven-spanning net laid out by the lake, she had easily broken through. If they were to encounter her head-on, it would be even harder to keep her.

Cao Zhengge said, "Grandmother Lin, you are the Xuan Marquis of the Patrol Heaven Department. This thief has injured and killed our clan elders. Please report to the court and list her on the Red List. Then someone will deal with her!"

"No... that's not appropriate..." Lin Aoshan frowned. "Nephew Cao, this is a dispute over interests, a battle between two sides. Even if there are casualties, it doesn't warrant the Red List. You are asking me to abuse my authority, which is very inappropriate."

Her seniority was extremely high, and her status was special. Therefore, when facing clan elders and older seniors, she could call them "nephew." For younger generations, she would call them "grandson." She couldn't be bothered to calculate exactly how many generations apart they were.

"Hmph!"

Cao Zhengge said coldly, "It's a pity the Lin family treats you as their grandmother, protecting and obeying you in every way. Among the dead and injured, there are also your Lin family elders. Right now, only your identity as the Xuan Marquis of the Patrol Heaven Department can vent our anger for us. And you are unwilling to do even that!"

"Cao Zhengge, do you think I'm a fool? If we want to deal with the Broken Sword Mistress, we have other ways. Why must we involve my grandmother?" Lin Houlong shouted, stepping forward to block Lin Aoshan.

Cao Zhengge fell silent.

Chu Qiudong said, "It's not appropriate. If this matter blows up and the affair of the Golden Scales in the lake spreads, it will inevitably attract envy. When the Golden Scales descended from the heavens back then, there were ten in total. Now seven have been distributed, leaving three."

"If it spreads... can we still successfully retrieve these remaining three?"

At these words, everyone woke up as if from a dream. After a long silence, they each said, "A gentleman's revenge is never too late."

"We must plan this long-term!"

On the Dragon Gate Tower.

Gu Nianjun looked at the lake and sighed, "The Broken Sword Mistress... truly formidable. Wherever she goes, a storm of blood follows. It seems this time is no exception."

For now, matters were settled.

The clans of the prefecture city had no plan and no way to take revenge, so they remained inactive for the time being. Li Xian lived in the Cold Moon Residence, calming his mind. After resting for two more days, he would head back to the One Union Manor.

"There are still two days left. If you want to go anywhere to have fun, hurry up. It's unknown when you'll come to the prefecture city again."

"But the clans of the prefecture city can't kill you, but they can kill you. Pay attention to your own safety."

The words of the Mistress echoed in his mind.

The courtyard was empty. Li Xian enjoyed the peace and quiet, saying to himself, "Golden Scale, Golden Scale, in this small pool, are you swimming freely?"

In the small pool of the Cold Moon Residence. The Golden Scale swam freely in the water, making the pool shimmer and reflecting light onto the courtyard walls and trees.

"There are still two days left; I should indeed have some fun. Although this prefecture city is full of danger, seeing such a vast world makes Qingning County seem a bit lacking."

"In just a few days in the prefecture city, I met my brother, obtained a precious sword, and snatched the Golden Scale. It's been quite an exhilarating trip."

Li Xian applied some rouge to cover the red mole on his forehead. After thinking for a moment, he darkened his face, added some beard stubble, held his breath, and made his body look a bit burlier.

The streets were bustling.

The incident at the lake was the talk of the town in all the city's taverns. The prodigy displaying his divine abilities, the rare dishes broadening their horizons, the summit at the Tower of Martial Inquiry, snatching the Golden Scale from the lake. Showing divine power by stepping on the waves, one arrow deciding the outcome. It was full of twists and turns, truly exciting, a splendid tale to be passed down.

But the latter part... the four families failing to take the Golden Scale, the Mistress backing her lover, the troops trapped by the lake, the tragic casualties after the dust settled... all this was suppressed by the operations of the Cao, Lin, Chu, and Yuwen families and was not mentioned by anyone.

After the first snow, a festival arrived.

Every household set up red lanterns, celebrating joyously with a festive atmosphere. The citizens of the prefecture city, rich and poor alike, dressed neatly and walked the streets with their families, enjoying a unique charm. Li Xian strolled around leisurely, felt the pocket in his chest, and found he still had a few dozen taels of silver.

He decided to spend it all, buying some street snacks: fragrant sticky rice balls, fried little crabs. The prefecture city is where seven rivers converge, so fish products are abundant. Crabs and fish should have been cheap. However, many industries are controlled by the great clans, who collectively drive up prices. So, what you actually buy isn't cheap.

It was midnight by the time he returned to the Cold Moon Residence.

The residence was quiet.

His leisurely mood gradually faded. Li Xian removed his disguise and thought, "To go out for a stroll, I still need to change my appearance."

"Strength..."

"I'm making more and more enemies. The Mistress is ruthless and has many enemies. By her side, I'm surrounded by enemies. It's only a matter of time."

"The only way is to improve my strength as soon as possible."

"With strength, I can have peace of mind and face everything with composure."

Li Xian played with the Golden Scale.

He recalled the gains from the banquet at the tower and thought, "The ancients said, 'One only regrets not having read enough when the time comes to use it.' The path of martial arts is the same. In this grand banquet at the tower, basic martial arts: Four Directions Fist, Breeze Leg, Great Luo Saber, and the entry-level martial art: Azure Luo Palm, all proved surprisingly useful. A martial artist's accumulation will show its effect at some point in the future!"

"If only my Vajra Thunder Finger were perfected, and I could apply the essence of the Trembling Thunder Finger to my archery. If I could use the chest-drumming thunder sound to shoot arrows, just how powerful would that be!"

[Proficiency +2]
[Proficiency +3]
[Proficiency +1]

The Vajra Thunder Finger had a formidable killing potential, and Li Xian practiced it diligently. He extended a finger and pointed at a snowflake in the air. The snowflake trembled and turned into dust.

"The four killing moves of the Vajra Thunder Finger. Among them, the Trembling Thunder Finger has another subtle use: it transmits a trembling force through the finger, making it easier to shatter rigid substances. Like rocks in the wild or the stone lions in front of a mansion."

"But for a living tree trunk, the tremor won't shatter it."

And so, two days passed.

October 27th.

The snow in the prefecture city grew heavier as the carriage drove out of the city.

The heavens were cold, the earth was frozen, the carriage was fragrant, and the beauty was within.

"The white clouds know the way back. It's cold outside, come inside to warm yourself," the Mistress said.

Li Xian lifted the curtain and entered the carriage. Ice beads had formed on his eyelashes, and he exhaled white mist.

The carriage was ten feet wide and ten feet long. A stove was set in the middle, making it very warm. Li Xian sat by the stove, and the frost on his body quickly melted.

The Mistress chided, "Look at you, you've made the floor all wet."

She lay on her side on the jade couch, her hand propping up her face. Her tender, white feet were exposed, her toes slender, her big toes slightly raised, like lotus flowers in June. Alluring and full of charm.

Li Xian warmed his hands and took the Mistress's feet, applying a massaging technique. The Mistress was taken aback, then her gaze softened, clearly enjoying it. A slight itch in her feet seemed to go straight to her heart, stirring her desires.

Li Xian said, "Mistress, why aren't we taking the water route?"

"The water route is troublesome," the Mistress said. "At the end of October, with the frost and snow, the Black River will freeze. Large ships need to break the ice to move forward. With special weather, we might have to wait a few days."

"Besides, every winter, river bandits are rampant. There are countless who stop ships to rob them. It's better to travel by carriage."

"I see," Li Xian said. His fingers applied a bit more force. The Mistress raised an eyebrow, her toes tapping Li Xian's chest. She chided, "You're using too much force. Why are you so careless today?"

"My apologies, Mistress..." Li Xian said. "I was thinking about something."

"What is it?" the Mistress asked.

Li Xian took the Golden Scale from his chest and said, "I want to offer this to you, Mistress."

The Mistress finally smiled. "Why? I didn't ask for it. Since the Golden Scale chose you as its master, it is yours. Such an opportunity, why don't you cherish it?"

"Mistress, you are broad-minded and have treated me well. I see it all," Li Xian said. "At this time last year, I was still among the servants, waiting respectfully for your return to the manor. I never imagined that in just a short year, I would be riding in a carriage with you."

"All of this is thanks to the Mistress's cultivation. I have no way to repay you, I just want to give everything I have to make you happy."

"If you have this heart, I am already happy," the Mistress said. "The Human Yellow 106, the Golden Scale in the pool. An opportunity that countless prodigies find hard to come by. You have this talent and this luck. Make good use of it. When your strength is greater in the future, you can repay me properly then."

"Please accept it, Mistress!" Li Xian said firmly.

The Mistress said coldly, "Are you being this stubborn, not even listening to my words?"

Li Xian remained silent. The Mistress sneered, "You want me to accept it? Fine. But when you return to the manor, you will go and receive your punishment."

"Thank you, Mistress," Li Xian said.

The Mistress said, "There is a hidden latch under your seat. Open it, take out the Heaven and Earth Box, and put the Golden Scale inside."

The Heaven and Earth Box was entirely black, circular, and required two hands to hold, like a jade carving. Opening the lid, the interior was exquisitely crafted beyond words, with seven divine peaks standing tall. Clouds and mist swirled, like a miniature world.

Li Xian thought to himself, "You say you don't want it, but you already have the box ready. If I hadn't given it to you, you would have flayed me alive."

The Golden Scale entered the box.

"Mistress, I heard others say that the Golden Scale contains 'Shi Yun' (Technique Implication). I don't understand it and would like to ask you for an explanation," Li Xian said.

"This matter..." the Mistress said. "There's no harm in telling you."

"The Heavenly Essences 36, Earthly Blooms 72, and Human Yellows 18 all contain [Shi Yun]."

"By consuming these precious treasures, one might be able to grasp the [Techniques] that lie beyond martial arts!"
