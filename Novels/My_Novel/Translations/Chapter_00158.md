Chapter 158: Yang Sword, Second Layer: Sharing the Sweet Dew

Qiu Yue mimicked the Madam's demeanor, moving with the grace of a lotus step, walking ahead. Passing through corridors and alleys, turning a corner, she entered the inner courtyard through a side door.

It was a case of Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi's frown—a clumsy imitation. Qiu Yue's appearance was not bad; if one were to remove the vulgarity between her brows and eyes and the sharpness around her nose and mouth, she would be a rather delicate beauty. However, compared to the Madam, she was far inferior.

"Keep your eyes to yourself. If you look around recklessly, be careful the Madam will gouge them out!"

They arrived in front of a room. Qiu Yue stopped her steps and threatened him. Seeing that Li Xian paid her no attention, she felt foolish and secretly fumed with anger as she pushed the door open.

White mist drifted out, mixed with heat and fragrance, making one drunk with its scent. Li Xian was startled. The interior decoration was clearly that of a bathing room. The clothes the Madam had taken off were hanging on a wooden rack.

Li Xian asked, "This is..."

"You can't even tell? So foolish. I really don't know why the Madam called you here," Qiu Yue mocked. "This is the Madam's bathing place. For someone of your station, it is a blessing cultivated over lifetimes to be able to step foot here in this lifetime."

Her words were sharp and biting.

"The Madam truly called me here?" Li Xian looked down on Qiu Yue from the bottom of his heart. Her insults and slander were like the wind blowing past his ears.

"Nonsense," Qiu Yue cursed. "You pig-headed fool. Without the Madam's permission, how would I dare bring you here?" She hated Li Xian deeply, feeling her position was threatened, so she naturally seized every opportunity to scold him.

She did this to assert her status and warn Li Xian. She didn't realize it was merely self-amusement.

Li Xian ignored Qiu Yue, standing at the door hesitating. He thought to himself that a woman bathing is the most private of affairs. Why was the Madam calling him now? From the situation, it seemed there was no urgent matter in the manor.

A moment later, he stepped into the bathing room. His body was enveloped by water vapor, and threads of medicinal power entered his body. Li Xian was surprised: "This water vapor is mixed with medicinal power, strengthening my body and nourishing my spirit?"

Li Xian looked around. The Madam's change of clothes, boots, socks, undergarments, and hairpins were all neatly folded and placed on a jade table.

Qiu Yue walked quickly a few steps,绕过 a screen, and saw a hanging curtain. The curtain was soft and smooth, like a cascading waterfall.

Lifting the curtain and taking a few more steps, they entered a spacious room with a pool built of jade.

The Madam practiced a "strange technique." After every seclusion, she would definitely take a medicinal bath. The medicinal herbs were expensive, and one bath cost hundreds of taels of silver.

The medicinal power would sometimes corrode the floor tiles. The jade stones paved here were all extraordinary items, capable of retaining the medicinal power and preventing seepage and corrosion.

Qiu Yue exchanged a few words with the Madam. Qiu Yue nodded and quickly walked out, holding a strip of gold-threaded black satin. She said, "The Madam orders you to wrap this black cloth around your eyes before going in to see her."

Li Xian nodded. He wrapped the black cloth over his eyes, plunging everything into darkness. He lifted the hanging curtain and went deeper inside. He felt the water vapor here was even thicker, and being steamed by it was greatly beneficial.

The Madam was reclining at the edge of the pool. Beside her were a fruit plate, pastries, candied fruits, a wine pot, and cups. Her long hair was loose, floating on the water. On the light blue bathwater, flower petals floated.

They half-covered her body. A few petals stuck to her jade-like shoulders.

She saw Li Xian arrive and told him there was a meditation cushion to the east, telling him to sit on it. Her expression was leisurely. She poured herself a cup of wine and picked up a fruit to eat.

Her eyes sized up Li Xian.

She thought to herself: "Calling him here will surely frighten him. Well then, let him be frightened."

She poured and drank by herself, enjoying the medicinal bath. Her body was flawless, but she particularly loved to care for her skin. She had added fragrance-enhancing and skin-brightening drugs to the medicinal soup.

The water vapor was hazy, like a fairy in the mist.

Li Xian heard the gurgling water and felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles. Although he knew a beautiful scene was before him, he only wanted to escape this place. He couldn't help but curse the Black Taishou. That thing was foul-smelling, noisy, and disgusting.

It was truly a curse from a crow's mouth!

Good omens are never accurate, but bad ones always come true.

The Madam was steamed by the mist, her cheeks somewhat moist. She picked up a black jade grape. This was a product of the Western Regions and extremely expensive. She peeled the skin and flicked it with her finger, saying, "Open your mouth."

Li Xian did as he was told. The peeled grape flew into his mouth, and the fruit fragrance overflowed. The quality of the fruit lay in its "fragrance" rather than its "sweetness." If the sweetness were too strong, it would cover up the fruit's aroma.

"You little servant, your luck is quite good," the Madam said, gently stroking the water waves. "The water lichees last time and the dragon grapes this time are all tributary items."

"Yes," Li Xian said. "It is all thanks to the Madam's blessing."

The Madam said, "Do you know why I called you here?" Li Xian stood up and said, "I truly do not know. Please enlighten me, Madam, so I can work for you."

"Sit down," the Madam said.

"You are in a hurry to leave. Are you afraid of me?" The Madam swam to Li Xian's front, her finger pointing to his chin.

Li Xian remained silent. The Madam said, "If I gave you a chance to share this bath with me, what would you do?"

Li Xian's heart skipped a beat. Being young and full of blood, upon hearing these words, it was inevitable that for a moment, lust and tenderness entangled him. But it vanished in an instant, replaced by a sense that something was terribly wrong.

Before today, he still had a half-chance to distance himself from the Madam. If they truly bathed together, the Madam would undoubtedly watch over him even more strictly.

He thought immediately: "Although the Madam will nurture me, she will also control me. As long as I follow the Madam, I will never be stronger than her. But now we are getting closer and closer, and it is beyond my control. Since things have come to this, I can only play it by ear."

Li Xian said, "The Madam is joking." The Madam said, "I am not joking. You are to undress immediately, but the cloth over your eyes must not be removed."

"Then enter this pool."

Her voice was cold, issuing commands without explanation, leaving Li Xian to guess and wonder.

The reason was...

She had seen that Li Xian's "Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword" had reached a decent level. She gradually intended to teach him the second layer. However, the Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword was a "Yang Sword." The higher the level of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword, the more it required the mixing of water and milk (intimacy), true and sincere emotions, and lingering entanglement to continue cultivation.

It was inevitable that there would be further contact.

Cultivating the sword technique together was not her initial intention. Her original goal was merely to control Li Xian.

But after several joint performances, she found this boy's talent in the Dao of the Sword was acceptable. Although his progress was not fast, he had not stopped improving.

The Madam thought: "This boy is loyal to me and has such a face. Using him to aid my cultivation is no harm. Since he is my private property, I should make full use of him."

The second layer of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword was called "Sharing the Sweet Dew," also known as "Yin Converges, Yang Unites." It required bathing together in the medicinal pool to lay the foundation for the sword technique. Today's medicinal bath was merely a trial.

Li Xian's nature was open-minded. He would not lose out either way. Being coy would be truly shameful. So he undressed and entered the bath.

"I suppose I am getting a free medicinal bath," Li Xian thought. "The Madam is dangerous and vicious, but her beauty is real. Perhaps one day, if my strength surpasses hers, I can suppress her. Then I can truly enjoy the pleasure of it. As for now... I seem to have a lot of romantic fortune, but in reality, I am like a snake coiling around my neck, breathing cautiously."

The Madam thought: "Such a young age, yet his physique has been tempered quite well." She looked him up and down and was very satisfied in her heart. She said, "Raise your hands."

The Madam placed her palm on his. She felt Li Xian's palms were scorching hot, and her heart fluttered, feeling as if a cat were scratching it. Even though her nature was cold and detached, in this scene, it was hard to avoid showing a different color.

She said faintly: "Gather your heart, banish thoughts, suppress desire."

The Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword is a set of paired sword moves. When men and women practice together, they should naturally indulge their hearts, release their thoughts, and stir desire. Only then can they grasp the essence and make fierce progress in the Dao of the Sword.

The Madam had outstanding talent and naturally knew this. At this moment, she deliberately made the opposite demand, intending to go against human nature.

She treated Li Xian as a private object, watching him be completely controlled by her. He had desires he could not stir, emotions he could not express, and thoughts he dared not act upon. To restrain and endure—only in this way could she feel at ease about future cultivation.

However, the matters of Yin and Yang are deeply entangled and mirror each other. Li Xian was a mirror, and wasn't he also reflecting her?

If she were bold and fearless, enjoying desire and pleasure at will, and became accustomed to it, she could truly achieve: having desire without emotion. Now, watching Li Xian restrain and endure, she instead felt an inexplicable feeling growing in her heart.

A bit of joy, a bit of achievement. If one person endures, the other can indulge. She treated Li Xian as a private object. Putting aside love and hate for now, at this moment, she truly felt as if she had found a treasure.

"Good, very good. Slowly come closer," the Madam's voice, though calm, now carried a hint of fluctuation.

Li Xian said, "Madam, this..." As soon as he spoke, a shallow sword mark appeared on his chest. The Madam's Qi condensed like a sword, injuring people invisibly, extremely powerful. She said, "If you say half a word more, I will skin your heart."

Li Xian was helpless and amused himself in his heart: "If I become stronger in the future, I will make you taste the true nature of a man." But for now, he had to be honest and obedient.

Today was only for bathing together, and there was nothing else. Half an hour later, Li Xian was unceremoniously driven out, confused.

[You have shared a bath. Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword proficiency +398]

[You have advanced in the Martial Dao, gaining great insight. Food Essence realm proficiency +1]

The medicinal bath ended. Qiu Yue immediately entered the bathing room to serve the Madam in dressing.

Qiu Yue said, "Madam, you are of a noble body, precious as jade. What urgent matter could not be transmitted by me? You had to let him come in. He associates with those laborers all day, dirty and smelly. If he dirties the bathing room, how terrible would that be?"

The Madam sneered. If it were about being dirty or smelly, Li Xian's foundation was clean, while Qiu Yue was a clay body, finding it difficult to even circulate Qi through her meridians. Who was dirty and who was smelly was obvious at a glance.

It was just that Qiu Yue could not see this layer.

After dressing, Qiu Yue helped the Madam comb her long hair and carefully put in the silver hairpins. Qiu Yue added, "Madam, I saw that Li Xian was looking around earlier. I don't know if he saw your intimate clothing."

"Shall we catch him and ask? Since entering the manor, he has been scheming to please you. Perhaps he harbors malicious intentions."

Hearing this, the Madam let out a soft hum. Qiu Yue's movements paused, a look of pain appearing on her face as a line of blood trickled from the corner of her mouth. Her head buzzed.

That soft hum from the Madam sent Qi into her ears through sound, shaking her internal organs and injuring her physique.

Qiu Yue's breath instantly weakened, her arrogant and domineering demeanor completely vanishing, turning into endless panic and unease in an instant. She hurriedly knelt and begged for mercy: "This servant... this servant knows her wrong. I do not know what I did to anger the Madam."

The Madam took the silver hairpin, inserted it into her hair while looking in the mirror. Her makeup was exquisite. She said faintly: "You are merely a servant. Being too noisy is a fault. Matters here, speak of them less in the future."

"Yes, yes," Qiu Yue hurriedly kowtowed, as if waking from a dream. She looked down on Pang Long everywhere, but in the Madam's eyes, she was just another "Pang Long."

In an instant, a great sorrow surged in her heart. She wanted to compete for favor with Li Xian, but only now did she realize that the Madam treated Li Xian as a person.

"Bring the Green Silkworm Rope. Today, I will practice the Silkworm Feather Flawed Jade Technique."

The Madam said faintly.
