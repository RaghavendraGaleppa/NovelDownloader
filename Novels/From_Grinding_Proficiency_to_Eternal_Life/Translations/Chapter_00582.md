Chapter 582: The Dao Fruit of the Profound Taiyin Mirror

Another, even more violent surge of Primordial Essence exploded forth (those who know, understand).

The Heavenly Empress felt her Divine Soul as if thrown into a millstone, ground into fine powder inch by inch, then forcibly reassembled by that uncanny True Meaning of Yin-Yang Separation and Union, repeating a cycle of suffering worse than death.

"At the end of the Heavenly River."

Her shattered Divine Sense radiated indistinct ripples, her voice hoarse and weak as a mosquito. "The Heavenly River flows backward, hanging upside down within the Mirror Star Abyss. There, the Dao Fruit of the Profound Taiyin Mirror evolved this Heavenly River. Its end is there."

Hearing the Heavenly Empress's answer, Xu Yunfan felt a surge of joy.

Success.

The creator of this Dual Cultivation interrogation technique was truly a genius!

He must make more use of it in the future.

After all, the *Scripture of Yin-Yang Separation and Union Governs All Things in Heaven and Earth* does not care about gender. Moreover, the practitioner can even manipulate the physical form—like in the Hundred Desires Peak, where many disciples entered as males but became females after achieving success in Qi Refining.

As for males.

Xu Yunfan still had his bottom line. He would simply cultivate a Banner Spirit to handle such matters later.

Suffer a little, bring happiness to oneself—what could be better?

Without the slightest reluctance, Xu Yunfan abruptly cut off the operation of the *Scripture of Yin-Yang Separation and Union Governs All Things in Heaven and Earth*.

The rampaging Yin-Yang Primordial Essence receded like a tide. The Heavenly Empress suddenly lost all strength, her body seeming to have all its bones removed as she collapsed onto the cold star-sand ground. She spat out mouthfuls of blood clots mixed with golden specks, her breath faint, her pupils completely losing their luster, leaving only emptiness and death.

Immediately after, an unprecedented sense of emptiness rose, leaving her stunned for a long time.

Her tattered celestial robes, once revered as the Mother of the Heavenly Court, could no longer cover her wretched body, ravaged to the extreme.

"That saves me some trouble. With the posture of a Heavenly Empress, she barely qualifies to be my Banner Spirit."

Xu Yunfan showed no pity and no hesitation.

A light flashed in his hand as he summoned the Zhoutian Star Spirit Banner.

The deep, dark banner surface unfurled, with starlight flowing within. A power specifically targeting Divine Souls and Spirits, immense and irresistible, descended fiercely, enveloping the Heavenly Empress's Divine Soul and her almost-exhausted Immortal Spirit Dao Foundation.

A True Cultivator at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm—under normal circumstances, she would never have had the chance to enter his banner. He only had this opportunity because he caught her while she was severely injured.

Even though her Dao Foundation was shattered, it was still the Dao Foundation of a peak Foundation Establishment expert.

"No..."

The Heavenly Empress's last trace of unwillingness turned into a silent wail before she was sucked in by the banner surface like a giant whale swallowing water.

Her physical body, under the牵引 of the mysterious starlight, had her essence blood rapidly stripped and devoured, transforming into wisps of dark golden pure energy streams that merged into the banner surface.

Meanwhile, her weak, Heavenly Court-specific Immortal Spirit Soul was rapidly refined by the banner's unique soul-snatching power, transforming into a Banner Spirit.

On the banner surface, a new star point condensed and lit up at a visible speed.

This star point was far larger and more resplendent than the previous Felan's, its color presenting a bizarre interweaving of dark gold and icy blue. Inside, a faintly visible figure was curled up, wearing tattered palace robes, with a delicate face but an indelible sorrow and a hint of numbness from forced personality erasure.

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. This Heavenly Empress's status was indeed quite high.

Once she entered the Star Spirit Banner, aside from Zhang Ziyang, who was specially cared for by Xu Yunfan, she was the strongest.

"Pay respects to, Honored Master..."

The newly born Heavenly Empress spirit within the banner, though her mind was completely twisted and restrained by the Star Banner, leaving only absolute awe and obedience deep in her soul toward the controller of the banner, Xu Yunfan.

Because she retained her intellect, the Heavenly Empress, who was once second to none, naturally felt somewhat unaccustomed to kneeling before someone else now.

Xu Yunfan didn't mind, merely gazing at the Heavenly Empress's graceful figure.

In the next instant, the Star Banner trembled slightly. A feedback power, far more potent and pure than Felan's previously, carrying a cold and dignified Immortal charm, surged into Xu Yunfan's body, nourishing his Divine Soul and cultivation level.

The Star Banner trembled slightly, its spiritual light noticeably brighter.

Xu Yunfan was pleasantly surprised.

The Myriad Soul Banner actually had such an effect. The fact it could now provide feedback was likely because the Star Spirit Banner had accumulated enough refined power.

No wonder, no wonder the Primordial Origin Sect listed the Myriad Soul Banner as one of the essential artifacts to refine.

If an ordinary person obtained this Myriad Soul Banner, they could simply kill people to devour essence and qi, rapidly increasing their strength. As long as their cultivation realm was sufficient to control their power, they could quickly advance to the Great Perfection of Qi Refining until they condensed a Dao Foundation.

This treasure truly lives up to its reputation as one of the supreme treasures of the Demonic Path.

Even the Mother of the Heavenly Court, a peak Foundation Establishment existence, could only bow her head and contribute everything after entering this banner.

He put away the soul banner, his gaze sharp as lightning, immediately locking onto the thread of golden light aura in his hand, which emanated an immortal aura and originated from the Dao Fruit of the Profound Taiyin Mirror.

He poured his Divine Sense into it with all his might, and the vague guidance suddenly became clear.

There was no need to look back. The energy fluctuations from the main battlefield in the distance were like a boiling pot of oil. The traces of the Heavenly Emperor's final resistance had vanished, meaning the attention of the three True Lords was about to disperse.

Time was urgent, burning his eyebrows. Xu Yunfan naturally dared not stay any longer.

If the True Lords were to detect that there was still a hidden Dao Fruit in this Heavenly Realm, he, who discovered it first, would likely suffer a great牵连.

If he was going to do it, he had to do it well.

Without hesitation, Xu Yunfan's figure moved, merging into the shadows of the wind within the void. Moving at his fastest speed, he followed the guidance of the golden light and rushed toward the so-called Inverted Mirror Star Abyss deep within the Heavenly River.

Wherever he passed, the Heavenly River became even more turbulent. The flowing star sand, carrying shattered space fragments, formed dangerous whirlpools and countercurrents.

The once beautiful Heavenly River, filled with ethereal music and brilliant divine light, now only remained a scene of devastation and the prelude to destruction.

The deeper he went, the more perilous the space turbulence became, as if the entire star river was on the verge of shattering under the battle of the True Lords.

Finally, the scene ahead suddenly changed.

The surging Heavenly River formed a massive spiral-shaped ultimate vortex here. At first glance, it seemed like the end of the entire star river.

However, Xu Yunfan naturally knew this was an illusion. This Heavenly Realm was round above and square below. Although it had one great realm and thousands of small realms attached to it, it ultimately could not compete with the Taihua Spirit Void Realm.

And at the very center of this vortex, it was not a collapsing black hole, but a strange spectacle of an inverted starry sky.

The starry sky was not an illusion, but composed of countless extremely solid strange star sands flowing with cold moonlight, forming a massive, mirror-smooth circular crystal wall.

The crystal wall reflected the violent, surging Heavenly River below, but strangely absorbed and digested it, gathering and settling the chaotic, violent energy, transforming it into pure Taiyin Star Power.

Deep within the wall surface, it was dark and boundless, containing an unimaginable power of the Ultimate Yin Law.

"Truly a good place."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh in admiration.

The Heavenly Empress in the banner, upon seeing this, couldn't help but stare at the place with complex emotions. This place had carried too much of her心血.
