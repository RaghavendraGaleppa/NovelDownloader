# Chapter 410: A Moment of Clarity, the Ice Cube Refines the Heavenly Phoenix Domain!

The sound of Li Mo's questioning echoed through the Crystal Palace, and the atmosphere suddenly fell into a heavy silence.

‘Qin Yuzhi’ was silent for a few seconds before she laughed.

"You are overthinking it, Lord Ancestor. I am the genuine article. You just need to do as I say, and the truth will reveal itself."

"Even Qin Yuzhi herself cannot be certain if she is still herself. You shouldn't be so sure."

Ying Bing recalled the diary in the corridor and said softly, "Qin Yuzhi failed to compete with you for control. The real her, along with her physical body, is sealed within the coffin."

"And you... are imprisoned by the Heavenly Phoenix Domain and have never been able to control it, is that right? Yun Meng Xian."

Ying Bing spoke these words almost subconsciously.

After she finished speaking, her expression froze slightly.

Why did she know these things? But it seemed to be a matter of course...

Li Mo didn't understand the situation and even gave her a thumbs up in his heart.

As expected of the Ice Cube,冰雪聰明 (ice and snow smart).

He pointed at ‘Qin Yuzhi’ and said in a deep voice, "Bold monster, I saw at a glance that you are not human!"

"Sigh, why don't you believe me? If you hadn't reminded me..."

‘Qin Yuzhi’ let out a long, soft sigh, then the corner of her mouth curled up.

"I almost thought I was Qin Yuzhi myself."

She muttered to herself, her pupils turning from gray-white to a vortex-like state as she looked at Ying Bing.

"Fortunately, you... are not her either..."

A meaningless statement fell.

Her ethereal voice caused the suspended Heavenly Phoenix Domain to surge violently, like a pot of boiling water, becoming extremely unstable.

Was ‘Qin Yuzhi’, or rather, Ancestor Yun Meng, also probing?

"Seal!"

Tian Miao was skilled at dealing with spirits and lightly parted her lips to utter a True Word.

She had used this move against the Dream Fiends before, with excellent results.

However, the moment the True Word touched the Heavenly Phoenix Domain this time, it vanished into nothingness in an instant.

"Sleep... Sleep..."

‘Qin Yuzhi’ hovered in mid-air, her black hair dancing wildly.

Something within the Heavenly Phoenix Domain seemed to want to break free, causing its light to暴涨 (暴涨 - skyrocket).

It was illusory, yet also seemed real.

"My eyelids are so heavy..."

"If I fall asleep..."

Li Mo's mind grew increasingly groggy. He thought of the Dream Fiends outside. Was their spirit silent in eternal slumber, leaving only walking corpses behind?

He and Tian Miao were probably just extras.

The Ice Cube was the true target!

Li Mo's body lit up with a faint golden glass light, activating Vajra Body.

Unfortunately.

No matter how hard the body, it cannot stop sleep.

His vision blurred, and his consciousness quickly became hazy.

In a daze, he felt as if he were falling into an abyss. This abyss wasn't endless; it faintly emitted a light.

Suddenly, it became very bright in front of him.

The weather was a bit hot, seemingly the height of summer. The glass of tall buildings reflected the scorching sunlight.

Blurry, Li Mo saw a stream of cars outside the school gate.

A girl dressed youthfully and beautifully,大概 (大概 - roughly) eighteen or nineteen years old, stood before him.

She was slender, with her hair in a bun. Her face was pure and beautiful, and her legs under the hoodie and short skirt were snowy white. She held a book in her arms and was smiling at Li Mo.

Behind her was the noisy university campus.

Li Mo: "?"

Where has this brought me?

Is this still the Nine Heavens Ten Lands?

Or was the Nine Heavens Ten Lands just a bizarre dream he had while daydreaming in class?

"Li Mo, you're a good person."

"......"

Little Li felt a few goosebumps on his neck, as if this sentence had touched the depths of his soul.

He seemed to recall something.

---

After all, who hasn't had a crush on someone of the opposite sex when young.

This girl had once perfectly fit his youthful fantasies. From the start of her freshman year, this pure, bright, and cheerful senior had filled his campus life.

Finding the dormitory... getting a phone card... joining the student union...

Hmm, until today, his roommate accidentally let it slip.

"Li Mo, I said you're a good person." The senior waved her fingers in front of his eyes.

"Ah, indeed, I am indeed a gentleman."

Li Mo snapped back to his senses and nodded.

Then he felt it was a bit strange.

Shouldn't he be speeding up his heartbeat and saying "no, no, no" with embarrassment? Why did he say he's a gentleman?

Moreover, not only did he not feel any heartbeat, his heart was completely calm.

He even felt... that's all there is to it.

"Well, I... quite like good people."

"?"

This development isn't right, is it?

If it were a normal person, they might be immersed in the tender trap, but Little Li felt that everything in front of him was becoming increasingly unreal.

Who gives someone a good person card and then talks about dating?

This isn't even a dream, it's damn science fiction!!

Something's wrong!

And...

"Senior, you don't like boys, do you?" Li Mo said seriously.

He remembered now. In his previous life, his big-mouthed roommate, who listened to wind and rain, went around saying he liked this senior. Later, the senior vaguely told him.

She has a girlfriend. You should find one too, junior.

*Pa—*

A light sound, a crisp shattering sound came from somewhere.

The dream began to crack.

Li Mo, whose consciousness was recovering, let out a soft sigh. Being rejected by a girl in such a way,恐怕 (恐怕 - I'm afraid) he couldn't have imagined it even in a dream.

Even for Yun Meng Xian.

"......"

"....."

The scene in front of him quickly restored, turning back into the magnificent Crystal Palace.

And the ‘Qin Yuzhi’ who was still imposing just moments ago.

Now, her eyes carried a hint of astonishment:

"You woke up, no, you are not..."

Before her words could finish.

Beside Li Mo, Ying Bing also opened her eyes simultaneously. Her clear, deep eyes hid a trace of complexity.

Her brow lit up with a divine mark, and phoenix feathers seemed to burn and extinguish around her. Her jade-like face, which was captivating with every glance, became even more sacred.

What did she dream of in her dream?

And for what reason did she wake up so quickly?

Li Mo was a bit curious, but now was not the time to ask.

"You're awake?"

"Mm. Li Mo, go and open the coffin."

Upon hearing this.

‘Qin Yuzhi’s’ face turned ashen.

"Alright!"

Li Mo immediately rushed forward, reaching out with both hands to grip the heavy coffin lid. This lid seemed to have been welded together with the coffin onto the entire Crystal Palace, as heavy as moving a mountain.

"Strength!"

Tian Miao also woke up and uttered another True Word.

Li Mo felt his physical power increase by several points again.

The next second, he加持 (加持 - blessed) with World Power!

*Za!!*

The heavy coffin lid finally moved open slightly.

Behind him, a whistling sound came.

Ying Bing shot up into the air, heading straight for the main body of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain.

She wasn't trying to undo it.

She was... trying to refine it
