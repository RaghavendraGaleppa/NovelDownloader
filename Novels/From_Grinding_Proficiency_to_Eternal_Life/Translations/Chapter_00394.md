Chapter 394: Primordial Origin Sect, Primordial Demon Sect

Many natives, unable to restrain their desires after suddenly being exposed to high concentrations of spiritual energy, suffer from spiritual energy scouring their bodies, leading to explosions of their physical forms. This is a common occurrence.

Before he finished speaking, Xu Yunfan scanned his surroundings. Confirming that Hundred Flowers Real Lady had already gone far away and only the Primordial Origin Sect disciples who had come out together remained in the field, he immediately sat down cross-legged.

This scene brought a faint smile to Xu Tian's face.

Looking back, he saw that the other Primordial Origin Sect disciples all had similar expressions in their eyes.

The scripture of the *True武 Devouring Demon Sutra* surfaced in Xu Yunfan's mind. Although he couldn't formally cultivate it because his meridians were unblocked, the breathing method recorded within could still be勉强运行.

In such an environment, it would allow his physical quality to rise once again!

Just as he thought this, the pores all over his body opened up, and countless tiny spiritual energy vortices formed on the surface of his skin.

After this spiritual energy entered his body, it was immediately devoured and divided by the ten different types of true qi. After being refined and purified, it merged into the intersection of his flesh and blood.

However, the result left Xu Tian and the others dumbfounded.

When they had first entered the sect, weren't they all cautious, adapting to the pure spiritual energy bit by bit?

Who else could be such a monster like Xu Yunfan, swallowing and absorbing it like a whale!

Half an hour later, Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, a sharp light flashing within them.

In just this short period of cultivation, the total amount of true qi in his body had actually increased by more than ten percent!

"Let's go."

He stood up and patted the nonexistent dust from his clothes, his gaze sweeping over the seven Primordial Origin Sect disciples. "Let's leave this place first."

The group followed the mountain path downward and soon arrived at a secluded valley.

In the valley, a stream babbled, strange flowers and exotic grasses were everywhere. Although the concentration of spiritual energy was not as high as that near the World Gate, it was still far superior to any blessed cave heaven or fortunate land in the Divine Martial World.

"We've already left the range of the World Gate; it's safe now."

"Senior Brother Xu, we have already brought you in as agreed..."

One disciple said cautiously, his eyes filled with pleading.

The others also echoed his words, only Xu Tian standing to one side, his expression shifting不定.

Xu Yunfan looked at them quietly and suddenly smiled. "Yes, thank you, fellow disciples."

As soon as his words fell, his right hand shot out like lightning, five fingers like hooks grabbing the sky-covering aperture of the nearest person.

The "Soul Search" recorded in the *True武 Devouring Demon Sutra* was activated, and violent true qi instantly rushed into the other's sea of consciousness.

"Ah!"

That disciple let out a shrill scream, blood flowing from his seven orifices as he died.

The others changed color in horror and turned to flee.

Xu Yunfan's figure was like a phantom, weaving through the crowd. Every time he struck, he accurately slapped the back of one person's heart.

The Ten Extreme true qi penetrated their bodies, shattering their heart meridians.

In just three breaths, six corpses lay on the ground.

Xu Yunfan shook the blood off his hand and looked at the only one left standing, Xu Tian.

"Senior Brother! I am loyal to you! Moreover, the Primordial Origin Sect forbids infighting among fellow disciples. We, we are family, of the same surname! Perhaps five hundred years ago, we were as close as brothers!"

Xu Yunfan said with a smile, "In principle, the Primordial Origin Sect forbids fighting, but privately, that's not the case. As long as no one finds out, there is naturally no fighting."

Xu Tian knelt with a thud, kowtowing like捣蒜. "I can serve as your subordinate, gathering intelligence for you, I..."

"You know too much. If I really let you all go, I really won't be able to eat or sleep well. Would you have the heart to let me curse you like this in secret?"

Xu Yunfan sighed. "The rules of the Primordial Origin Sect, aren't you the clearest about them?"

Xu Tian's face turned deathly pale, and suddenly, he launched a desperate attack!

A poisoned short sword slid out from his sleeve, stabbing straight at Xu Yunfan's throat. At the same time, his left hand formed a seal, and a message talisman shot into the sky.

"Seeking death!"

Xu Yunfan sneered. He didn't even need to pinch the token to shatter Xu Tian's soul. He didn't dodge or avoid, letting the short sword stab his throat.

The dragon scale armor leaves suddenly fluttered and rose, and with a 'clang', they actually blocked the poison sword.

However, this short sword was exceptionally sharp, actually tearing a hole in the armor leaf.

It seemed that a level eight divine weapon armor from the Divine Martial World couldn't withstand a short sword from a low-level disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect. He would definitely need to refine it again if he got the chance.

His thoughts turned, and after the test was done, his right hand formed a claw and crushed the message talisman, while his left hand pressed against Xu Tian's chest.

"No!!"

With Xu Tian's desperate roar, the Ten Extreme true qi flooded in like a flood. Xu Tian's body swelled like an inflated balloon, then exploded into a mist of blood with a 'bang'.

Xu Yunfan was already prepared. He released his true qi to form a barrier, not letting a single drop of blood splash onto himself.

He bent down and picked up Xu Tian's storage bag from the pool of blood. With a sweep of his divine sense, he found that besides a few bottles of pills and over a hundred spirit stones, there was also a jade slip recording the essentials of a hundred techniques. It actually contained the method for the Hundred Meridians Ghostly Art.

"So they all kept a hand for themselves, these bastards..."

Xu Yunfan sneered repeatedly.

Whether it was You Quan or Xu Tian, the *Hundred Meridians Ghostly Art* they had handed over before each missed the most critical key points. If he hadn't been on guard and rashly cultivated it, he would have definitely suffered a qi deviation.

He wouldn't have died, but he might very well have turned himself into the deformed appearance of that old monk from the Thousand Buddhas Temple in the Divine Martial World.

These demonic path cultivators were truly sinister in their intentions. Even a soul search couldn't get everything clean. Fortunately, he was cautious enough, otherwise he would have really fallen into a pit.

Putting away the spoils of war, Xu Yunfan flicked out a true fire, turning the corpses into ashes.

The mountain wind blew past, scattering the ashes among the strange flowers and exotic grasses filled with spiritual energy, as if no one had ever come.

"Primordial Origin Sect..."

Xu Yunfan looked towards the distant mountains shrouded in clouds and mist, where countless pavilions and towers were faintly visible. His gaze was fervent.

According to what Xu Tian and the others had said, although the Primordial Origin Sect was called the Primordial Demon Sect by other sects on the outside, it was undoubtedly a majestic immortal sect. Many of its techniques were actually grand and majestic, even more righteous than the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect.

Unfortunately, the way they used and cultivated these techniques was truly unflattering. It was normal for them to be called the demonic path.

He took out the map jade slip he had obtained from Xu Tian. After confirming the direction of the Hundred Desires Peak, he leaped onto a towering ancient tree.

From the top of the tree, he could see a mountain peak resembling a crouching tiger a hundred miles away. That was the place he was going to next.

According to Xu Tian's instructions, the Hundred Desires Peak was also a top-tier force within the Primordial Origin Sect, specializing in the technique of Yin-Yang dual cultivation.

The Peak Master, Hundred Flowers Real Lady, was powerful and extremely skilled in the art of Yin-Yang harmony. She had cultivated the foundation-building path of Hundred Desires Devouring Origin.

Most importantly, the Hundred Desires Peak had a large number of disciples and loose management, making it the most suitable place for a counterfeit like him to hide.

Xu Yunfan operated the light body technique from the *Ten Extreme武道*, leaping and flying through the mountains and forests.

As he continuously absorbed the pure spiritual energy, the true qi in his body became increasingly refined, showing a trend of transforming into true essence. Unfortunately, he still had no meridians in his body and couldn't operate the sutra's methods to refine his true qi and transform it into true essence.

Three hours later, he arrived at the foot of the Hundred Desires Peak.

Here stood a ten-zhang-tall stone tablet, on which were written the three powerful characters "Hundred Desires Peak". The handwriting contained a heart-palpitating, seductive intent.
