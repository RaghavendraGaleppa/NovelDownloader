# Chapter 27: Escaping the Heavens, Blessing in Disguise

“He’s damn mother…”

Li Xian’s blood surged. He drew his blade first. Although his heart was filled with dread, he was determined to die with dignity.

Suddenly, he heard the footsteps gradually slow down.

*What is it afraid of…? Afraid of alerting the people in the manor!*

Li Xian had a flash of inspiration and immediately shouted a few times.

The creature’s speed slowed further, then it suddenly stopped, seeming to hesitate whether to pursue.

“Madam Wen, you have arrived!”

Li Xian shouted loudly.

The mistress of the One Union Manor was surnamed Wen. Normally, one was not permitted to call her by name and could only refer to her as “Madam.”

This shout actually worked. The creature began to retreat. In reality, at this moment, he was still several miles away from the manor.

Li Xian seized the opportunity to push his speed even faster, finally stepping into the entrance of the manor.

He gasped for breath, looking back toward the darkness.

He saw a pair of crimson eyes the size of copper bells. Those eyes stared at him, then turned and left.

Li Xian let out a sigh of relief.

“Being able to escape this time is entirely due to the Madam’s prestige.”

Only after regaining his composure did he realize he was covered in cold sweat and his clothes were completely soaked.

Eight guards had gone out, but only one returned. It was a tragic sight.

The commotion here was quickly known to Pang Long. He brought Li Xian back to his room, serving him hot tea to warm his body and channeling internal energy to calm his spirit.

“This kid is indeed clever. He was slightly panicked just a moment ago, but now he is completely calm.”

Pang Long secretly praised him. When he felt Li Xian’s pulse, the blood energy was urgent but without chaos. Obviously, there was no major issue; he hadn’t been frightened out of his wits or lost his soul.

“This isn’t a one-time occurrence.”

“That Feng Huo had bad luck; he encountered it twice in a row.”

Pang Long said, “But now that we’ve returned to the manor, everything is safe. That thing dares not come close; it’s afraid the Madam will take its life.”

“Commander Pang, what exactly was that thing?” Li Xian asked curiously.

“I… I don’t know either,” Pang Long said. “Later, I will take you to the inner courtyard. You can report the specific details to the Madam.”

“The Madam…?” Li Xian had always been curious about this “Madam.”

“Take a moment to compose yourself. The Madam hasn’t gone to sleep yet,” Pang Long instructed.

The inner courtyard was where Madam Wen frequently went about. It did not require the D-rank guards to patrol, but occasionally, when there were matters to attend to, she would summon D-rank guards to enter.

Passing through a long corridor.

Li Xian looked around curiously and saw a lake on which lotuses grew. The lotuses were golden-green and looked stunning.

They were clearly not ordinary lotuses.

Although it was snowing outside, the inner courtyard was as vibrant as spring. In terms of area, the inner courtyard was several times larger than the outer one.

“The place is so big. I wonder if the Madam can live in all of it.”

“I heard Commander Pang say that the Madam has many friends from the Jianghu who sometimes come to visit.”

“The Jianghu… What is the Jianghu of this world actually like?”

Li Xian couldn’t help but feel curious. But if he said he yearned for it… that might not be true. From seeing the small to know the great, this Jianghu must be a place that devours people.

However, if he were a free man, even if the Jianghu was dangerous, he would be willing to give it a try.

“Madam, the person has been brought.”

Pang Long knelt on one knee outside a pavilion, speaking respectfully.

“Let him come in.”

A gentle voice came from inside, yet it carried an imposing aura.

Walking into the room.

A strange fragrance filled the nose, having the effect of calming the mind and focusing the spirit. Li Xian saw that the lights in the room were very dim. In front of him was a screen, and behind the screen was a graceful figure.

“Speak.”

There were no unnecessary pleasantries.

Li Xian lowered his head and recounted the events. A moment later, Madam Wen said, “I know.”

“Having undergone such a great change, this little guard’s speech is still clear.”

“Pang Long, take him down and give him one tael of silver to calm his fears.”

He was not allowed to stay for a moment longer before being led out of the inner courtyard.

Pang Long smiled and patted Li Xian’s shoulder. “You kid, you’ve actually gained good fortune from a disaster. One tael of silver is enough for you to visit the pleasure house several times.”

Li Xian smiled awkwardly. The misunderstanding from last time had not yet been resolved. Pang Long firmly believed that he liked going to those places of entertainment.

“The fact that you could get so close to the Madam is a rare opportunity. If you spread this around, it’s something to be proud of,” Pang Long said.

“Commander Pang,” Li Xian asked, “what will the Madam do?”

Pang Long said, “I don’t know. This matter is not for us to speculate. Whatever the Madam does, she has her own reasons.”

One tael of reward was enough to equal several months of salary. Holding it in his hand, it felt heavy, and Li Xian couldn’t help but feel extremely happy.

“Money… this thing is too important!”

After gaining a deeper understanding of “martial artists” and the “Martial Way,” Li Xian discovered that martial artists could not be detached from their work.

The Martial Way was a bottomless pit. Throwing thousands or hundreds of taels of silver into it might not even make a sound. One must have a way to make money.

Otherwise, why would that “Madam Wen” bother to manage this manor? To maintain the operation of the family assets?

The wandering swordsmen who, in imagination, float like immortals and travel the world freely might exist, but the vast majority cannot be so carefree.

When he returned to the dormitory.

Zhao Han and the others had already turned off the lights and gone to sleep. Li Xian was about to step inside when he suddenly saw a knocked-over chair that blocked his path.

He had already sensed it, did not actually get tripped, gently stepped over it, and helped the chair back up.

He closed his eyes and went to sleep.

The next day.

The incident regarding Li Xian spread, but the morning training remained unchanged. This was the only time he could practice martial arts, and Li Xian cherished it the most.

Having learned the lesson from yesterday.

When running around the manor, Li Xian ran one extra round than usual. Although his running speed was fast, it unfortunately had a limit.

Because it started to snow.

The guards’ enthusiasm for practicing martial arts was not high. During the Chen hour (7-9 am), some guards threw a few punches and then went to rest to prepare for their patrol duties.

Li Xian practiced tirelessly.

**[Perseverance, diligent practice of boxing, proficiency +2]**

**[Strong will, not following the crowd, will surely become a great talent, proficiency +3]**

After more than an hour of hard practice.

The proficiency of the Square Fist increased by another **[78]** points.

**[Square Fist]**

**[Proficiency: 812/1500 Small Success]**

“Do not seek to reach the sky in one step, but seek to make progress every day!”

“Unfortunately, the time for D-rank guards to practice martial arts is too short. If only I could become a C-rank guard…”

“Not only would the patrol time be reduced, but I would have an extra hour of practice every day, and I could also eat the C-rank meal! The C-rank meal includes beef and mutton… which is much better than fatty meat!”

Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

After eating one’s fill, one thinks of desires. Now that he eats enough, he naturally wants to eat better. He might as well bring his younger brother to eat better too.

“The guard competition is once a month.”

“It seems to be coming up soon. If it weren’t for the guard competition, Jiang Yun hadn’t improved further, and she wouldn’t have set her sights on my Tiger Blood Pill.”

Today, Li Xian’s patrol was still canceled.

Pang Long wore a simple “bronze bell” at his waist and walked the route from last night with Li Xian.

“Commander Pang, if that thing appears, can you handle it?” Li Xian asked.

“I don’t know, but with this bell, that demon dares not show itself,” Pang Long said, shaking the bell.

A muffled sound rang out, but it traveled very far.

Pang Long said, “A village, hundreds of taels of rent, can’t just be lost like that.”

“The Madam bestowed this bell, telling us to walk the path. If we find the rent, we take it back. If we see corpses, we bury them on the spot.”

“So they won’t end up as lonely ghosts.”

Li Xian asked, “Commander Pang, do you know what that thing is yet?”

“Well…” Pang Long looked at Li Xian. “The Madam mentioned it briefly.”
