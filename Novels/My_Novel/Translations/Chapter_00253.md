Chapter 253: The Legacy of a Libertine!

Li Xian thought to himself that since everything depended on luck wherever he went, there was no point in worrying unnecessarily. He might as well close his eyes and walk blindly. Since he was here, he might as well settle in; there was nothing to fear. With a carefree attitude, he pressed forward, moving through the passage.

If he encountered a rock wall, he simply turned in another direction. The feeling of dizziness immediately subsided. Instead, his heart and mind felt broad and open. The more he walked, the wider the path seemed, and the faster he moved.

The winding path... could also be called the "Heart Path." The road of the heart twisted and turned, difficult to fathom. The more one schemed and calculated, the more one got stuck in a rut.

Every step was narrow and constricting. One had to squeeze through cracks just to barely pass. If Wen Caishang were to enter this path, she would surely be in a wretched state. Li Xian was indeed skilled at scheming and calculating for profit, weighing various gains and losses.

But by nature, he was broad-minded and unrestrained. He let go of his inhibitions, and as he walked the path, his heart's road became spacious, naturally leading to an extremely wide path.

When he opened his eyes, he had already passed the winding path. The road ahead was now wide, with vivid murals on both sides.

Li Xian didn't think too much, moving forward while observing. He used what Wen Caishang had taught him to identify the tomb's mechanisms, skillfully avoiding dangerous areas.

After winding around for a while, he pushed open a stone door.

He arrived at a burial chamber. There were thirteen jade coffins suspended in the air. Li Xian vaguely recognized this as a "side tomb."

During the Nanyang period, there were specific rules for burial. Side tombs were for close family members. Because powerful martial artists had long lifespans, when they sensed their end approaching, they would bring their family's coffins into the tomb.

Li Xian lit some incense and paid his respects, saying, "I am not a tomb robber. I apologize for disturbing you, ancestors, please do not be offended." He twirled the incense stick in the "Nanyang ritual" and gently scattered the ashes.

The incense was quite simple. It was a type of flammable branch. Li Xian used his Yang Yuan Sword Qi to light it, just to show his respect.

Li Xian muttered to himself, "The Madam said... that ghosts and monsters exist in this world. But not everyone becomes a ghost after death. I should be more respectful."

He recalled his experience at Tiger Cry Ridge. The terrifying, stiflingly damp environment was uncomfortable enough, but the harassment from ghosts and demons was what truly made one's hair stand on end.

After Li Xian paid his respects, his courage grew strong. He thought, since he was here, why not take a good look? He looked at the figures in the jade coffins...

The first jade coffin held a woman. Her appearance was ordinary, and her clothes were simple. Li Xian gently touched the coffin and said, "This is a jade glass coffin. It prevents the body from decaying; it's extremely rare! One coffin is worth over a hundred thousand taels!"

"Lu Dongzhi is truly a man of passion!"

The inscription in front of the coffin read: "My first wife, born in the 12th year of the Nanyang Yong'an era. Died in the 71st year of the Yong'an era. I loved her deeply, and I regret that I could not join her in death."

The signature read: "Lu Dongzhi..."

Li Xian said, "So this is indeed Senior Lu Dongzhi's tomb! It seems this senior was a man of deep love. I truly admire him."

He walked further down to look at the second coffin. The person buried inside had hair as white as a waterfall, with slight wrinkles around the eyes and eyebrows. It was also a woman.

The inscription read: "My beloved wife, her martial arts talent was insufficient, and her lifespan could not be extended. I searched for the essence of heaven and earth, treasures and rare items... but ultimately could not save her. I loved her deeply, and I regret that I could not join her in death."

At the end: "Lu Dongzhi..."

Li Xian thought thoughtfully: "We martial artists drink the essence of heaven and eat the energy of the earth, so our lifespans are very long. This Senior Lu also started from humble beginnings. The partings and deaths he experienced along the way are truly indescribable!"

He felt a deep sense of respect. He walked further down to the third jade coffin.

The inscription read: "My third beloved wife... I loved her deeply, and I regret that I could not join her in death."

Li Xian's mouth twitched slightly, feeling something was off. He went on to the fourth, fifth, and sixth coffins. The beauties had different appearances and causes of death.

But each had the line: "I loved her deeply, and I regret that I could not join her in death." Li Xian gave an awkward smile and said, "It seems Senior Lu's heart... is truly broad."

He walked to the last jade coffin.

The woman was young, extremely beautiful, and held a noble status. She looked like an empress of the Nanyang Dynasty. She was also Lu Dongzhi's beloved wife. Li Xian thought to himself: "I've heard the Madam speak of Nanyang history. It seems there was indeed a Nanyang empress who was in love with Lu Dongzhi."

The inscription read: "My beloved wife, I loved her deeply, and I regret... sigh, I truly must join her in death!"

Li Xian couldn't help but laugh out loud. He suddenly felt that this Senior Lu Dongzhi was incredibly carefree and interesting. Li Xian noticed a wine jar in the corner. He shook it gently; there was still half a jar of wine left.

The burial items were valuable. Li Xian glanced at them and left carelessly.

He closed the door and left.

The tomb was large, but not malicious. Li Xian knew how to avoid its dangers, dodging them one by one. He explored various chambers, searching for the map of the forest.

There was no day or night in the tomb.

One day, he discovered a room filled with books. The Nanyang people placed great importance on tombs, believing them to be their homes after death.

Thus, they brought their favorite things and cherished items from their lifetimes into the tomb. Depending on the tomb owner's personality, the tomb's deadliness varied.

Wen Caishang had told Li Xian that if he verified the tomb belonged to Lu Dongzhi and did not act greedily or disrespectfully, there was a sixty percent chance of being unharmed.

Lu Dongzhi was wild and unconventional by nature, and a good host. During his lifetime, he once held a grand feast, inviting the heroes of the chaotic nations... all into his residence to appreciate cranes and view the forest.

Legend says he was a man of his word. He had hundreds of disciples, but those who truly inherited his teachings were one in ten thousand. It wasn't that he didn't teach, but that others simply couldn't learn.

Therefore... Lu Dongzhi's tomb was more like a silent, ancient mansion. "Come, drink three cups with me; friends are friends, whether fated or not."

The Great Yu tombs, however, were completely different. Great Yu placed extreme importance on bloodline inheritance and the distinction between legitimate and concubine-born sons. They had a saying: "The tombs of the former sages are the blessed lands of the later talents."

Therefore, the tombs contained many golden jewels and martial arts manuals. But the tombs were fiercely dangerous, with many obstacles.

This tomb had some valuable artifacts, but not many. They were just decorations for the residence. Li Xian thought: "I am a guest in someone's home, borrowing their things. If I were to covet the artifacts, wouldn't that make me a robber breaking and entering? That would be extremely disrespectful!"

This was his first time entering a tomb, but he gained nothing. It was like touring a family's courtyard.

He came to a library.

It was filled with countless books. Li Xian was overjoyed and entered to look around. Although there were no martial arts manuals, the knowledge recorded in the books was incredibly broad.

It included the seven arts of Qin, Go, calligraphy, and painting, as well as medicine, divination, astrology, and physiognomy... it contained everything. Li Xian, like a thirsty man finding sweet dew, picked up a miscellaneous book and read it with great interest.

He was hungry and ate anything. Originally, he only liked strange stories and anecdotes. Now, he didn't refuse statecraft principles or ancient poetry from the Book of Songs.

His ambitions were high.

He browsed through the books, observing the rivers and mountains.

He became so engrossed he forgot himself, but he never forgot his mission to search for the map. He had two pockets of "Vermilion Fruits," which had miraculous effects; one could satisfy hunger for a long time.

He had given half to Wen Caishang before entering the "winding path." He wasn't afraid of hunger or cold, so he slowly savored the books, unaware of the passage of time.

And he really did find the "map."

Li Xian observed for a moment and knew the map was correct. This place was no longer Tiger Cry Ridge, but a "Mysterious Mountain Range." Although Lu Dongzhi's abilities were high, the map he drew was only a corner of the mountain range.

But it was more than enough to get out of Tiger Cry Ridge and the Mysterious Mountain Range.

Li Xian thought: "I've found the map. As long as I get out of the tomb, follow the map back with the Madam, and get out of the forest, I won't have to worry about being chased anymore. In this way, my life... is finally safe!"

He rolled up the map and put it in a pocket inside his chest. He cupped his fists and said, "Senior Lu, I'm borrowing this. Your heart is as vast as the sea, so you won't mind!"

The tomb was too vast to explore completely. Li Xian was content and didn't plan to go deeper, intending to turn back. He felt a bit of regret that he had only glanced at many of the books and couldn't read them in detail.

"Forget it... as long as I'm alive, what's the worry about not having books to read?"

Li Xian had made his choice. Just as he was about to get up, he suddenly felt heavy-headed and light-footed, his mind in a daze. Li Xian played the "Body Guarding Sound," sealing his mind. Ever since entering the tomb, he had occasionally felt dizzy.

This time it was particularly intense, his eyelids growing heavier and heavier. Suddenly, a pause, white mist rose all around, swirling towards him. The surroundings were a vast white, like an illusory bubble, incredibly unreal.

Li Xian thought: "What is this..." He had never encountered such a situation before. He walked into the mist and suddenly heard the gurgling of a stream.

The sound was clear and pleasant.

A stream flowed through a stone pavilion. In the pavilion sat a man in white, his hands behind his back, his figure elegant. He slowly turned his head, but his facial features were difficult to see clearly.

Li Xian thought: "This situation is like a dream. Did I get so engrossed in reading that I dreamed of Senior Lu Dongzhi? Or did I stumble into some space in a daze? Well, it's useless to think too much. I might as well ask directly." He shouted, "Senior Lu?"

The man was startled and said, "Good lad! Please sit."

Li Xian was full of confusion and said, "Senior Lu, you're not dead?" Lu Dongzhi said, "I died long ago."

"Then how..." Li Xian asked.

Lu Dongzhi said, "It's simple, you're dead too!" Then he looked Li Xian up and down.

Seeing that Li Xian wasn't panicked, he found it uninteresting and said, "I'm in a dream!"

Li Xian didn't understand. "If you're dead, how can you be in a dream?"

Lu Dongzhi said, "Precisely because I'm dead, I can be in a dream. This involves a path of术 (Shù), called 'Legacy Dream'."

"After death, only a dream remains. It has flowed for a thousand years, with nowhere to land. You observed the stone tablets, and your temperament matched mine in some ways. This dream of the deceased naturally fell on you."

"You, this lad, were quite stubborn and didn't sleep. You held on for a few more days, but you eventually fell asleep. The dream came true."

Li Xian said, "What a powerful path of术!"

"Do you want it?" Lu Dongzhi said.

Li Xian shook his head. "No."

Lu Dongzhi cursed, "I knew no one would want it! Tell me, what's the use of this Legacy Dream术? If you were a beautiful woman who admired my style, and my dream fell on you, making you infatuated with me, then this术 would be somewhat useful. But you, this lad, look even more handsome than me, alas!"

"It's fate. You... with this appearance, receiving my inheritance isn't a disgrace!"

"It's a pity that I had many disciples, but none could truly inherit my teachings. I see you, this lad, are quite clever. But whether you can comprehend even a fraction of it is still a long shot. Forget it, forget it... Since you've entered this dream, what else can I do but give you some inheritance?"

He looked Li Xian over carefully.

Lu Dongzhi was wild by nature. His tomb was vast, but it didn't contain martial arts inheritance. The tomb's defenses weren't strict, and it had no great secrets.

But the "Path of术 · Legacy Dream" drifted and chose a person to fall upon.

Lu Dongzhi teased, "Do you have a partner?"

Li Xian said, "Not yet. Hmm... maybe I do, sigh, it's hard to say!" Thinking of Wen Caishang, the two of them had been intimate and dependent on each other, enjoying themselves immensely. But now that Wen Caishang's strength has returned, how they will get along is hard to predict.

Lu Dongzhi said, "I have three great regrets in my life, which are also my three great inheritances. Since you have received my inheritance, please do your best to fulfill my regrets."

"First regret: The Path of术!"
