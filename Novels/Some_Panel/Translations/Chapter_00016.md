# Chapter 16: Crimson Fire Jade

This fiery red stone was the size of a millstone, its surface shimmering with a crimson glow.

At a glance, Yang Ji saw the information displayed: (Fire Tinder Stone, containing Crimson Fire Jade within. Wearing it provides warmth in winter and coolness in summer, can nourish spiritual consciousness, strengthen the soul, and to a certain extent, inhibit the generation of inner demons.)

The brief information filled him with ecstasy.

Whether it was nourishing spiritual consciousness or suppressing inner demons, any treasure possessing even one of these functions could fetch an extremely high price.

This was because the soul became especially crucial in later stages of cultivation.

For a Nascent Soul True Monarch to achieve the revered Soul Transformation stage, they had to pass through three tribulations: the Gale Wind, Heavenly Fire, and Startling Thunder. These were tribulations of the Primeval Spirit.

Passing these three tribulations would grant one a Pure Yang Primeval Spirit, unafraid of wind, fire, or lightning.

When the Primeval Spirit left the body, it could traverse thousands of miles in an instant, possessing a grand teleportation divine ability that defied heaven and earth. At that point, with a Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol manifested, one could sit in their courtyard and destroy enemies thousands of miles away.

There were also some powerful Nascent Soul True Monarchs who, though not yet at Soul Transformation, could split their Primeval Spirit like a Soul Transformation expert, creating an external avatar.

One could appear in the world, revered by all, while the other remained hidden in a cave, concealing their achievements and fame. Two lives for one person—truly formidable.

A Nascent Soul True Monarch was undoubtedly a patriarch of their domain.

Thus, the preciousness of such a rare item that nourished spiritual consciousness was evident.

Furthermore, the function of suppressing inner demons was also extraordinary.

For cultivators, inner demons were inescapable.

Cultivating too quickly could easily breed inner demons; greedy and lustful thoughts could also give rise to them.

So, how valuable was a treasure that could inhibit the generation of inner demons?

Innumerable cultivators surely understood its worth without needing further explanation, as if a mirror were held to their hearts.

Crimson Fire Jade!

The Fire Tinder Stone actually contained a piece of Crimson Fire Jade!

How much was this worth?

Five thousand spirit stones?

Or even ten thousand spirit stones?

Yang Ji immediately impetuously cleaved the Fire Tinder Stone with his sword and retrieved the Crimson Fire Jade.

Looking at the thumb-sized Crimson Fire Jade in his hand, his mood greatly improved.

Sea monsters were indeed extraordinary; worthy of being masters of the sea, the caves they chose were truly treasure troves.

Elated, with one piece of Crimson Fire Jade in hand, Yang Ji immediately began meticulously searching the various tunnels and connected caverns.

However, after two thorough searches, he still found no second piece of Crimson Fire Jade.

Yet, heavenly treasures were inherently rare; encountering even one was already a stroke of immense luck.

Yang Ji was content. Filled with joy, he left the cave, released his Water-traveling Skiff into the ocean, and entered it.

He had been out for over a month.

The harvest was considerable.

Yang Ji prepared to return to the city to sell all the monster materials he had obtained.

He would exchange them for spirit stones, thus embarking on his grand alchemy career.

The Water-traveling Skiff traveled smoothly, and by dawn, Yang Ji arrived at South Wind Island.

At Myriad Treasure Pavilion.

Jin Dafu looked at the pile of materials before him and exclaimed, "Brother Yang, you actually managed to single-handedly kill an Overlord Crab of your own cultivation level. Your combat power is truly formidable!"

A peculiar glint truly flashed in his eyes. Those who could single-handedly slay monsters of their own level were geniuses with extraordinary combat prowess.

"Haha, just luck. Please help me calculate, Elder Jin, how many spirit stones are these materials worth?" Yang Ji sat in a chair, taking a sip of spiritual tea, feeling quite leisurely.

"Generally speaking, a first-grade monster is worth one hundred spirit stones, a second-grade monster two hundred, and a third-grade monster three hundred."

"However, fourth-grade monsters, because they condense a demonic core, double in price to six hundred spirit stones. As for fifth-grade monsters, they are twelve hundred spirit stones."

"Of course, this is just the value of an ordinary fifth-grade monster. This Overlord Crab, for instance, is definitely worth two thousand spirit stones, only slightly less than an average sixth-grade monster."

"Two thousand spirit stones?" Yang Ji calmly looked at Jin Dafu. He had roughly calculated the value of the Overlord Crab, and two thousand spirit stones was close enough. He was too lazy to haggle, so he nodded and said, "Alright."

"Mm, as for the Arrowtooth Demon, it's more common, worth six hundred spirit stones. And for the other Fire Tinder Stones and Heavy Stones, I'll offer fifty spirit stones. All these materials together amount to two thousand six hundred and fifty spirit stones. What do you think, Brother?" Jin Dafu chuckled.

"Alright! Also, Elder Jin, please appraise another treasure for me," Yang Ji said with a mysterious smile.

"Oh? A treasure? What kind of treasure?"

Seeing the smile on Yang Ji's brow and his excellent complexion, a hint of curiosity arose in Jin Dafu's heart.

"Please lend your discerning eye, Elder Jin, and tell me how many spirit stones this treasure is worth."

Yang Ji swept his storage bag, taking out a thumb-sized object. It was like a red agate, perfectly round and fiery red, its surface emitting a three-inch crimson glow, like a burning, blood-colored flame.

"This is...?"

When Jin Dafu saw this item, a strange glint flashed in his eyes, but it quickly faded, so fast it was astonishing.

If not for the two characters (Surprised) floating above his head, Yang Ji might have thought he hadn't experienced any emotional change.

Jin Dafu didn't stare at the Crimson Fire Jade for long. First, he nonchalantly took a sip of tea, then, like an old master, slowly rolled up his sleeves, leisurely taking the item, before examining it with an air of casualness.

"Don't worry, Brother, let me take a look for you!"

He placed the Crimson Fire Jade between two fingers, scrutinizing it from left to right, his posture extremely focused and serious.

After a long while, he finally said with an unperturbed smile:

"Brother, your discerning eye is still a bit lacking."

"This is just a piece of red jade, not really a treasure."

"Such red jade typically forms in submarine magma zones. Those underground rocks, after being intensely heated for years, will form this red jade once they've accumulated enough age."

"It's actually similar in nature to alchemy, but this red jade is far less precious than elixirs; you can find it by the handful."

"Brother, you've just started your venturing experiences; there's still much to learn."

Jin Dafu smiled faintly, paused, then continued,

"Since you've brought it before me, I can't let you leave empty-handed. Ten spirit stones, and I'll take it."

Jin Dafu spoke with conviction, then took a satisfied sip of spiritual tea. Above his head appeared (Comfortable), (Manipulation), (This is probably worth five thousand spirit stones, right?), (Huge profit).

"How about it, Brother Yang?" he asked with a beaming smile, looking at Yang Ji.

*You sly old Jin Dafu, trying to manipulate me again?*

Now, the initiative was in Yang Ji's hands, so he scoffed internally, feeling no panic.

He immediately replied with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes:

"Elder Jin, that's a bit disingenuous of you. I showed you this Crimson Fire Jade because I respect your integrity, so how can you claim it's just red jade?"

*This?*

*This fellow actually recognizes Crimson Fire Jade; his discerning eye is quite impressive!*

Jin Dafu was inwardly startled. With a guilty conscience, his gaze flickered as he secretly sized up Yang Ji.

He then picked up the Crimson Fire Jade from the table again, held it before his eyes, and after a long moment, confidently declared:

"Brother, I couldn't be mistaken. This truly is red jade. Look at its color; doesn't it just scream 'red jade'?"

"Oh? Since Elder Jin's eyesight is insufficient, then I shall take this Crimson Fire Jade to other shops to have it appraised," Yang Ji said, preparing to stand up.

"Hey, Brother, don't rush, please sit down first!"

Jin Dafu waved his hand, good-naturedly pressing him back into his seat.

He was greatly surprised inwardly.

*This fellow has connections!*

*Even with my countless years of appraising treasures, it took me a while to confirm this was Crimson Fire Jade, but this guy insists on it without a hint of pretense. How could he recognize it?*

Jin Dafu glanced at Yang Ji, feeling a bit vexed. He then feigned ignorance again, picking up the Crimson Fire Jade to examine it, frowning as he did so. Suddenly, he slapped his forehead and exclaimed loudly:

"Aiyaya, it really is Crimson Fire Jade! Look at my eyesight, I actually misjudged it and almost caused Brother to lose hundreds of spirit stones!"

*Oh, Jin Dafu, Jin Dafu, your acting is so lifelike! It's a real shame you didn't go to Blue Star to become an actor; you'd have missed out on a hundred Best Actor awards!* Yang Ji truly felt a surge of emotion.

Jin Dafu looked at the Crimson Fire Jade and sighed, "What a pity, what a true pity!"

"This piece of Crimson Fire Jade lacks sufficient 'fire maturity'. It must have formed in less than a hundred years, failing to absorb enough essence from heaven and earth. The spiritual energy within the jade is insufficient. Although it can nourish spiritual consciousness, the effect isn't significant; it can only be considered low-grade."

"If it were a good piece, one that had been forming for several hundred years, a glance would reveal only a burning crimson flame, its surface entirely invisible."

"But the piece Brother has here only emits a mere three inches of crimson glow. Its value is only around a thousand spirit stones."

Jin Dafu shook his head, regretting profusely.

"I've seen many such Crimson Fire Jades in my family. At the very least, they are worth five thousand spirit stones. Elder Jin, don't try to fool me. I came to Myriad Treasure Pavilion specifically to support your business," Yang Ji feigned anger. The reason he didn't take it to other shops was to avoid drawing covetous eyes and unnecessary trouble.

Moreover, he held the title of Ship Warden at Myriad Treasure Pavilion, which was far more valuable than tens of thousands of spirit stones.

Next time he went out to sea, Jin Dafu would still be counting on him. Would harming him not be detrimental to his own interests?

A shrewd person like Jin Dafu would have his abacus clacking loudly in his mind and wouldn't be shortsighted for a few spirit stones.

*Family?*

*Seen many?*

*Could this kid truly be from a major family?*

Jin Dafu's expression flickered, and he was inwardly surprised. *Such discerning eyes... could he really be a scion from a major family?*

*That doesn't make sense; he's so poor.*

Yang Ji naturally discerned his thoughts.

He was currently presenting himself as well-informed, subtly implying: *Don't try to deceive me, or I won't bring good items for you to trade next time.*

Although Crimson Fire Jade was a good item, this piece, as Jin Dafu had said, was indeed not old enough and too small, so its effect on nourishing spiritual consciousness was limited. Exchanging it for spirit stones now was the best option.

"Five thousand spirit stones, Brother, that puts me in a bit of a difficult position," Jin Dafu said, a troubled expression on his face.

Seeing no hint of compromise in Yang Ji's eyes, Jin Dafu felt a bit deflated.

However, Yang Ji's next words brightened his expression considerably.

"Elder, you won't be in a difficult position. I also need to buy spiritual herbs and an alchemy cauldron."

"Haha, Brother, well said, well said!" Jin Dafu's eyes lit up at the words, and he grinned widely again.
