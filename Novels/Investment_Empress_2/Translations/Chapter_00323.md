# Chapter 323: Today We Cheer for the Great Sage Sun, For the Demon Mists Have Risen Once More

A monkey of immense divine power emerged from Mount Huaguo. He learned the arts from a master, took the Sea-Calming Needle from the Dragon Palace, and proclaimed himself the Great Sage Equal to Heaven.

Until he disrupted the Peach Banquet.

Shaking heaven and earth.

This time, the heavens did not send an edict of bestowal, but rather a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers and generals, the Four Heavenly Kings, and even the True Lord of Manifestation who answers to summons but does not attend court. Who among them did not possess immense cultivation? Who among them was not a lofty god?

A shocking great battle was imminent. He did not look back, yet it seemed he could hear a voice filled with laughter:

"They only see me as a wild monkey, stubborn and hard to tame, fond of bravery and strife. Because I was not invited to the Peach Banquet, I felt discontent and acted recklessly."

"But if the heavens are shattered once..."

"From now on, who else but Sun Wukong could raise havoc in the Heavenly Palace?"

The sky drew near. Rolling dark clouds dispersed like a sea of stars surging with storms. Even if not in the same world, one could feel the overwhelming pressure.

He raised his eyes, his pupils the color of pure gold, as if flowing through a raging fire, growing ever brighter.

He stood between heaven and earth. To say he was a pillar supporting the sky and the earth would not be an exaggeration.

Yet, Li Mo's almost frozen mind couldn't help but recall another story.

Jing Ke's assassination of the King of Qin.

Prince Dan, fearing that the state of Yan would be destroyed by Qin, asked Jing Ke to bring the map of the Yan territory, specifically the region of Dukang, to the Xianyang Palace to assassinate Ying Zheng.

Jing Ke had an assistant named Qin Wuyang.

After ascending the hall, the fierce and belligerent Qin Wuyang, who had dared to kill people at the age of thirteen, trembled with fear before the majesty of Ying Zheng.

But Jing Ke remained calm and collected, at ease. In the end, he unfurled the map, and when the map was fully unrolled, the dagger was revealed.

Those who are merely fierce and belligerent are inherently weak. They only show off their might before those weaker than them, but before those truly stronger, they are even more cowardly than the timid, just like Qin Wuyang.

Only those with true courage and fearlessness, with a conviction in their hearts, would dare to assassinate the King of Qin, tread upon the Celestial Court, and raise havoc in the Heavenly Palace.

As this realization dawned upon him.

The divine intent to battle against the heavens and the earth suddenly dispersed, then converged once more at his brow.

In an instant, a torrent of spiritual light surged from his mind, even more turbulent and surging than when he had received the "Diagram of Wukong Seeking the Dao" last time.

*Law of the Form of Heaven and Earth!*

*Body Outside the Body Technique!*

*Three Heads and Six Arms!*

*Secret of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven... Spell of Immobilization... Gathering Qi and Dispersing Form... Drawing a Circle to Lock...*

Various divine powers flashed one by one. Some Li Mo had seen in works of art, others were completely unfamiliar, and some he couldn't even begin to describe.

He felt like a solitary boat in a vast ocean, about to be drowned by these waves.

A thought arose in Li Mo's heart in his hazy state.

*Family is truly reliable.*

This divine intent was not stingy at all; it seemed to have given him everything it could, afraid that he might not learn it or learn it completely.

Brother Monkey gave so much; it wasn't in vain that, as a child, he didn't even look at the fairy maidens, his eyes only fixed on the monkey...

Li Mo's face flushed slightly, his mind shaken violently.

And at that moment, a pure, yin-like brilliance shone into his heart, nourishing his soul and restoring peace and tranquility.

*Ice Cube?*

No time to think, no time to thank the Ice Cube for her help.

Li Mo quickly looked at the divine intent inheritance he could now barely see clearly.

*Secret of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!*

The inheritance entered his mind.

In a daze, he saw a figure fighting fiercely within the dark clouds.

*The golden monkey rises with a thousand-pound staff, clearing the heavens of ten thousand miles of dust.*

This is the foundation for the strong to wield their blades against the stronger, and also the method for the weak to overcome the strong!

This single divine power alone made his soul feel unbearable.

*Four Apertures of Observing the Divine* was not enough.

At this moment.

The pure, yin-like brilliance flared brightly!

A pleasant sound of a zither also rose by his ear.

One minute ago.

"Another spirit has been gathered."

Ying Bing had just subdued a Blue Duck divine intent within the Jade Phoenix Spirit, making it a form within her own.

This so-called subduing did not necessarily involve combat.

The Blue Duck was adept at water and skilled in the art of music.

As long as one gained its recognition in the comprehension of water flow and the way of music, it counted as subduing.

Ying Bing used this to break through, reaching the Five Apertures of Observing the Divine.

"How is he?"

---

She put away the Jade Phoenix Spirit and looked toward the table not far away.

She saw Li Mo's face flushed, his breath somewhat disordered, yet carrying an extremely unfamiliar yet vast and mighty divine intent fluctuation.

He... was receiving some kind of divine intent inheritance?

Ying Bing tilted her head.

That was definitely not a divine intent from the Jade Phoenix Spirit.

Lately, she hadn't seen him observe any divine intent either. Where did this come from?

And this was not any divine form she knew of...

Frowning, Ying Bing sensed that his soul was struggling to bear it, so she took out the guqin from the big-headed doll.

*Ding-dong—*

A flowing, light sound arose. Even those who were not observing a divine intent would feel refreshed and happy upon hearing this melody.

The zither's notes turned into gentle waves of water, enveloping the youth.

Li Mo's expression immediately improved significantly.

"He seems to be on the verge of a breakthrough?"

Ying Bing vaguely sensed his soul's state.

She went with the flow.

Li Mo, who had his eyes closed, moved his eyelids slightly, as if sensing something, and immediately let go of his mind.

Ying Bing felt an extremely vast and complex divine charm from that soul, one that was indomitable yet extremely difficult to control.

It was simply like a stubborn donkey.

She had to be patient, using the pure yin as a guide and the zither's melody as a medium, slowly guiding him.

Finally, in his soul, a soundless light响 seemed to echo.

A certain barrier was broken.

It was a new world.

"How do you feel?"

Ying Bing put away the guqin, walked to his side, crouched down with her arms around her knees, and stared at him.

Then she saw that Li Mo still had his eyes closed, mumbling to himself as if talking in his sleep.

"Today we cheer... for the Great Sage Sun."

"Only because the demon mists... have risen once more..."

Ying Bing's mirror-like eyes froze.

*Great Sage Sun... who is that?*

Last time in his dreams, he called out his own name.

This time, this Great Sage Sun he called out must also be a very important existence to him...

Ying Bing glanced at the sky outside the window and didn't rush to wake him.

She sat at the table, drinking tea, in the rising dawn, her peripheral gaze falling on him from time to time.

It seemed even she felt she had been staring at him for too long.

So she started thinking about this current battle.

"The Southern Frontier, although not at the core of the Great Yu, was still expanded at the cost of immense manpower and resources."

"This time, the attackers even include the remnants of the Great Shang dynasty."

"Emperor Jingtai once strongly supported the Prince of Nan in expanding the territory. Why is he now处处 constrained, and even at the eve of battle, summoning him back to the imperial capital to report his duties?"

Ying Bing lowered her gaze slightly.

Anyone who knew of this would find it suspicious.

Could this be related to the chaos of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands that came later?

Could it also be related to the fact that no one has achieved immortality in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands for many years?

At this moment, Li Mo also opened his eyes.

He saw the Ice Cube not far away and was slightly surprised. He couldn't bear to interrupt the girl's thoughts, so he just watched her jade-like face illuminated by the morning light, cold and serene, her eyelashes shimmering, adding a touch of sacredness.

"You're awake."

Ying Bing then realized that the youth had been secretly watching her for who knows how long.

"Just woke up."

"How do you feel?"

"Mm, refreshed and energized. Let's go, let's go to the city wall. Do you think Commander Qu will be startled when he sees us?"

Li Mo stretched and got up to push the door open.

"Childish."

Watching Li Mo's brisk figure walking ahead, Ying Bing gently tied back her scattered black hair and inserted her jade hairpin. She couldn't help but feel that those troubles didn't seem so worrisome anymore.
