# Chapter 408: Who is Calling the Ice Lump? The Crystal Palace of the Main Tomb!

Based on the information in the text, the reason this underground palace was built was because the教主 (Cult Leader) named Qin Yuzhi discovered that another existence was awakening within her body?

This situation seems to have started when she dreamed of becoming someone else?

That is why she built this Cloud Dream Palace to bury that existence.

Things are getting interesting...

Tian Miao's face flushed with excitement as she analyzed the situation rapidly. She seemed to have an immense interest in things she did not know.

"Another existence awakening within her body?"

Lian Bing pursed her lips, unable to help but think of her past life.

She, too, had often dreamed of scenes she had never seen before. At the time, she hadn't thought much of it, assuming they were distracting thoughts arising from her cultivation.

It was also during this process that her heart for the Dao became increasingly firm, as if a voice in her heart was constantly urging her, telling her:

‘Unless you become an immortal and ascend to the heavens, everything is but a fleeting cloud.’

"You have finally come..."

The wind carried a voice, drifting from an empty place. Lian Bing was stunned.

A layer of goosebumps rose on Li Mo's neck.

Another existence awakening within one's body...

The information contained in these words was immense.

The purpose of the tomb beasts is to guard the great tomb, yet they targeted the Lian family...

This implies that the Black Year Beast believed that only by leaving no one alive in the Lian family could this great tomb, the Cloud Dream Palace, be safe?

Now that the great tomb has opened, it is indeed because of the Ice Lump...

But the text cut off at a critical moment, a cliffhanger!

"One day, when the sword is in hand..."

"What are you saying?" Tian Miao snapped out of her thoughts.

"Nothing."

Li Mo silently retracted his inner monologue. Only after holding the Ice Lump's small hand did he feel a bit calmer.

Hm?

Why is the Ice Lump's hand so cold?

He turned his head back.

He found that Lian Bing's face was as white as frost on snow, her eyelashes trembling slightly as if she were recalling some unpleasant memories.

Sensing the turmoil in her heart, Li Mo tightened his grip on her small hand and asked softly, "Ice Lump, what's wrong?"

"Didn't you hear it?"

"Hear what?"

"Up ahead, someone is speaking, calling my name," Lian Bing said with her eyes downcast, murmuring, "The voice... it's getting... louder and louder."

"!"

Li Mo leaned back slightly, and cold sweat instantly broke out on his back. He clearly hadn't heard anyone else speaking.

And since they were the first to reach the bottom of the underground palace, how could there be someone ahead of them!

"Should we... turn back the way we came?"

Li Mo's expression turned serious.

They actually had a way out at any time. They could just enter the small world. No matter how strange the existence, could it possibly chase them into his small world?

The problem was that if they came out of the small world, they would reappear in the same spot.

What must be faced, must be faced in the end.

Somersault Cloud...

It could only take him away alone. The prayer beads he gave the Ice Lump were a product of the Seventh Realm, the Pinnacle of Profound Mastery. It might not be able to display its original power here.

"I'm afraid it's too late."

Tian Miao shook her head and took a deep breath. "The thunder behind us is getting closer. It doesn't matter to me."

That thunder was the sound of the Seventh Realm Pinnacle Sage behind the Crown Prince.

He was rapidly approaching!

"Then let's continue forward!"

Li Mo made a decisive choice.

He took the Ice Lump's small hand and called to Tian Miao. The three of them moved forward quickly.

The space suddenly opened up before them.

It was an extremely vast space. The stone walls were embedded with a starry array of luminous pearls, whose soft light illuminated the vast area, clearly outlining the silhouette of the main tomb.

Five-man-broad bronze pillars rose from the ground to support the heavens. There was one at each of the four corners, adorned with various totemic patterns.

Their form was somewhat similar to those seen in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, but even more magnificent.

---

In the center of the main tomb stood a palace made entirely of glass. It was crystal clear, its light as dreamlike as crystal. A bewitching halo washed over the walls, resembling the aurora in the sky.

Cloud Dream Palace...

This was the true Cloud Dream Palace.

Around it lay a dozen or so desiccated corpses. They seemed to have possessed immense power in life, and even now, without a trace of aura, they remained lifelike.

They were likely the high-ranking members of the Demon-Calling Cult at the time?

Through the open palace gates, a glass coffin could be seen inside, from which the bewitching light emanated.

The divine city reflected in the sky seemed to be the projection of this Crystal Palace.

"Let's go, let's go!"

Tian Miao took the lead and walked ahead.

"Ice Lump..."

Li Mo looked at her pale face with concern.

He had already used his Eye of Providence, but what worried him more was that the Ice Lump's recent experiences had become a blur.

They had no choice but to go in and investigate.

"I'm fine."

Lian Bing tried to force a cold smile, but it looked somewhat strained.

"I am the Celestial Sovereess."

"I hope the voice calling your name means it, otherwise my Divine Hammer Little Tyrant is not one to be trifled with."

Li Mo gave a thumbs-up, his face clearly writing the words 'Reliable'.

Lian Bing looked at him with a somewhat dazed expression, a gaze that reminded one of the little Ice Lump from the dream.

Well, she had indeed recalled what happened in the dream.

The little Li Mo in the dream who tricked her into calling him 'Big Brother' was slowly overlapping with the current Li Mo, both equally reassuring...

"En!"

The two of them caught up to Tian Miao ahead.

They stepped into the Crystal Palace.

*Crack————*

A thunderous sound erupted. The hard stone wall above the passage they had come from shattered, revealing a void filled with rolling thunder.

The stone wall writhed, as if trying to heal itself, but was continuously torn apart by the serpents of lightning.

A figure stepped out from within. An old man, hands clasped behind his back, walked out as if strolling in a courtyard.

"Your Highness, this place should be the main tomb. Its origin is not simple, and it indeed cost this King some effort."

"Thank you, Imperial Grand Uncle."

After bowing, Jiang Yu's dual pupils couldn't hide his excitement. The Divine City suspended above the Imperial Capital—could the solution to its mystery be hidden here?

"We should be the first..."

He looked into the distance, but his pupils suddenly constricted.

In his line of sight, three figures had just stepped into the Crystal Palace.

"It's them?!"

*BOOM—*

Another loud sound.

Another side of the mountain wall was suddenly breached. Inside were Tan Zhuyin and the others, looking much more disheveled, each bearing injuries.

In fact, if they hadn't been members of the Demon-Calling Cult, and the last powerful Corpse Fiend hadn't refrained from attacking them, the entire group would have been wiped out.

"Why isn't my celestial brother responding..."

Luo Yexian muttered to himself, then looked up and exclaimed in shock, "Holy Son Nephew, they're about to go in!"

"Brazen! With the Prince before you, how dare you try to steal a march!"

The leader of the Sky Patrol Guards in silver armor suddenly sprang into action, darting towards the entrance of the Crystal Palace.

Two of the Demon-Calling Cult's Dharma Kings moved with him.

*Zap!*

At that moment, the gates of the Crystal Palace suddenly began to move.

Before the two figures could arrive, they finally slammed shut.

PS: I know everyone wants to see romance, leveling up, and showing off in public. I love writing those things too.

But the world-building still needs to be gradually improved. Otherwise, as the story progresses, it will become a castle in the air, with more and more plot holes left unfilled.

In short, world-building is difficult to write, yet it is essential, and it must be integrated into the main plot. My head has been aching from it lately...

Fortunately, the next part of the plot will mainly be about giving you all some sweet moments, hehe.

Thank you, readers, for your support!
