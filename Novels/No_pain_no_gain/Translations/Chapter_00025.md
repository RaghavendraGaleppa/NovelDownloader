# Chapter 25: A Road Without a Door

A small yellow-feathered bird flew from afar, circled a few times above Han Zhen's head, and then landed on his shoulder.

Han Zhen took out a yellow birdseed and put it into the bird's beak.

Han Li, seeing this familiar bird, was stunned for a moment, and quickly understood many things.

"That's right, perhaps I'll return once within two years, or perhaps our next meeting will be far in the unforeseeable future."

"I have already cultivated the Changchun Arts to the eighth level, and I've pretty much learned all the spells."

Han Zhen said, and a fist-sized red fireball emerged from his fingertip. The scorching heat forced Han Li to activate his Changchun Arts to isolate himself from the burning sensation.

Han Zhen knew the general whereabouts of Golden Light Elder, so he naturally considered intercepting him in advance.

If he could find Golden Light Elder in the barbarian lands, Han Zhen would naturally not return to the Seven Mysteries Sect.

Hearing Han Zhen personally state that he had cultivated the eighth level of Changchun Arts to perfection and that his mastery of spells surpassed his own, Han Li already had the answer in his heart, but he couldn't help feeling a bit frustrated.

One must know that he consumed medicinal pills like candy, and it still took him two years to break through from the fourth to the sixth level.

However, Han Li quickly adjusted his mindset.

With the small green bottle, he could always treat medicinal pills like candy; he wouldn't always be trailing behind him.

Han Li asked Han Zhen to wait a moment, then lightly tapped his toes, disappearing outside Shenshou Valley like a wisp of light breeze.

A few breaths later, Han Li reappeared before Han Zhen, clutching several small porcelain bottles, and handed them to Han Zhen.

"The white bottles contain Yellow Dragon Pills and Gold Marrow Pills, which can save a lot of time in cultivating the Changchun Arts."

"The green bottles contain Clear Spirit Powder and Essence Nurturing Pills, which are remarkably effective for internal and external injuries."

Just before leaving, a thought suddenly struck Han Zhen. He turned and asked Han Li if the medical books left by Doctor Mo contained any prescriptions for infertility, which made Han Li gaze at Han Zhen with an unusual look.

"Don't let your imagination run wild, I'm asking this for Third Uncle!"

Han Li's face uncharacteristically reddened, but a few traces of warmth arose in his heart, and he remembered Third Uncle's matter.

Brother Zhen had changed, yet he hadn't.

Watching the other's retreating figure, Han Li thought of his family.

"I wonder how my little sister is doing; she should be fourteen or fifteen now."

He had received a letter from home a few days ago, mentioning that many wealthy families had come to propose marriage.

Unlike Han Zhen's carefree nature, Han Li wondered if he could leave so calmly after seeing his parents again in the future.

He knew very well that ever since he started cultivating the Changchun Arts, he had embarked on a path entirely different from ordinary people.

***

Bidding farewell to Han Li, Han Zhen then took his leave of Master Wu and Sect Master Wang, using the excuse of seeking opportunities to break through to Xiantian realm, and then departed on the wind.

"Is this the demeanor of a Grandmaster?"

Deputy Sect Master Wu and Wang Juechu watched Han Zhen, who rode the sunset like an exiled immortal, and fell into endless longing.

***

Three months later.

Guang Gui City was located in the southernmost part of Lanzhou. It was not a large city, with only hundreds of thousands of residents. Mount Tainan was not far from the west of Guang Gui City.

At the foot of Mount Tainan, a man dressed as a hunter walked cautiously through the forest, heading north.

The man was Han Zhen, returning with a bountiful harvest from the barbarian lands.

Just two Vajra Talismans alone surpassed Han Zhen's entire previous net worth.

Adding the Immortal Ascension Token and the Magical Talisman Sword, his net worth instantly reached a level that would make even Foundation Establishment cultivators envious.

It was truly good luck. After spending two days traversing the Hundred Mang Mountains, Han Zhen inquired about Golden Light Elder at the very first barbarian village he encountered.

Originally, Qin Ye Ridge had two major cultivation families, the Qin family and the Ye family, who were also in-laws and got along well.

However, after many generations, the Qin family gradually declined due to the dwindling number of male offspring.

By the generation of Golden Light Elder, the Qin family had only one male descendant left, Golden Light Elder himself, and his aptitude was extremely poor.

The Ye family naturally set their sights on several rare treasures passed down through generations in the Qin family, with the Immortal Ascension Token being a must-have item for them.

Golden Light Elder might have had poor aptitude, but he was cunning and timid as a mouse. Before the Ye family could make a move, he hastily absconded with the Immortal Ascension Token and the talisman depicting the small sword, fleeing to a Taoist temple in the barbarian lands to swindle food and drink.

Several years later, after Golden Light Elder ascertained that there were no cultivators in the vicinity, his courage grew. Relying on the Vajra Talismans and his shallow magical power, he pretended to be a deity, preying on and exploiting the local villagers.

Originally, Han Zhen had a slight resistance to actively killing people to seize treasures, but after learning of Golden Light Elder's evil deeds, he made up his mind to act on behalf of heaven.

Han Zhen disguised himself as a local barbarian. Golden Light Elder had been acting arrogantly for years and had long lost his vigilance towards mortals.

Han Zhen didn't even use Fireball Art. Relying on the cooperation of Wind Control Art and Smoke Cloud Steps, in a flash of lightning, he seized Golden Light Elder's vital point.

Upon learning that Han Zhen was not from the Ye family, Golden Light Elder thought he still had a chance to save his life, so he naturally confessed everything he knew.

In addition to his entire fortune and the Five Elements cultivation method he practiced, Han Zhen also forced out the incantations for some common talismans.

Among them, besides the incantation for the Vajra Talisman, there was also the incantation for the Sound Transmission Talisman, which Han Zhen urgently needed.

***

Unfortunately, the ancestral cultivation method seemed to have some kind of restriction; Golden Light Elder suffered a backlash after revealing only a little, so Han Zhen had no choice but to give up.

Naturally, Han Zhen wouldn't go back on his word about not killing him. After crippling Golden Light Elder's magical power, he handed him over to the barbarians.

At this point, the Wild Wolf Gang also ceased to exist. Han Zhen, of course, did not witness the upheaval that the Seven Mysteries Sect experienced upon learning of this.

***

Tai Nan Valley was located north of Mount Tainan, and its entrance was perennially shrouded in dense fog, making it not difficult to find.

Although he missed the Tai Nan Grand Gathering, which occurred once every five years, it was also a good thing for Han Zhen, as the chances of encountering high-level Qi Condensation cultivators were greatly reduced.

However, Han Zhen also made appropriate disguises, dressing as a hunter. Following the villagers' guidance, he found the hillside shrouded in white mist.

But Han Zhen encountered a problem: to enter Tai Nan Valley, one needed a Sound Transmission Talisman to send a message before someone would open the formation and let them in.

Although he knew the incantation for the Sound Transmission Talisman, he hadn't seized the actual item from Golden Light Elder. He could only try his luck near the entrance.

Several days later, Han Zhen, who was meditating and resting on a large tree, suddenly opened his eyes.

A combination of a young girl and a burly man arrived before the white mist using an evasion technique Han Zhen had never seen before.

Han Zhen suppressed his aura and used his Heavenly Eye technique to glance at them. The girl's cultivation level was similar to Han Li's, while the burly giant was above Han Zhen's.

Han Zhen observed that neither of them had any malevolent aura, and their cultivation wasn't much higher than his own. Knowing that such a good opportunity would be hard to come by again, he actively revealed himself.

The burly giant immediately shielded the girl behind him, instantly pulling out a spiritual talisman that glowed brightly, ready to activate it.

"Fellow Daoist, please don't be angry, I bear no ill will!" Han Zhen quickly spread his hands to show he meant no harm, but secretly he was ready to use Smoke Cloud Steps at any moment.
