# Chapter 335: The Dust of Extinction Heart Sutra

The author: The Crow is Black for a Reason

The sheer, terrifying aura emanating from Xu Yunfan forced the Imperial Guards, who had surrounded him like an iron wall, to involuntarily retreat step by step. The Black Iron Spear Formation automatically parted to create a path.

Wherever Xu Yunfan passed, spiderweb-like cracks appeared on the ground. These battle-hardened elites were actually forced into trembling by an invisible pressure, to the point where they could barely hold their weapons!

Chen Wei’s knuckles turned white as he gripped his black spear. The shaft groaned under the strain, and where the tip touched the ground, the bladelike energy it emitted had already carved deep, dark fissures into the blue stone tiles.

He stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan’s back, the veins on his neck bulging. Yet, in the end, he did not thrust the spear. He could not make a move, nor was he capable of doing so.

Xu Yunfan’s strength, the condensation of his qi, and the vastness of his true energy made Chen Wei’s heart pound with fear.

The opponent was stronger than him!

Reaching the exit, Xu Yunfan paused slightly and said coldly, "Even without the Great Zhou Xuanhuang Qi protecting you, you are still not my match."

Before Chen Wei could react, Xu Yunfan’s figure vanished instantly.

Only then did Chen Wei’s expression twist violently, becoming ferocious and terrifying.

"Xu! Yun! Fan!"

Chen Wei’s face twisted like that of a vengeful ghost, and his furious roar shook the Vermilion Bird Street archway, causing dust to fall in rustling layers.

Xu Yunfan found a high, deserted pavilion, sat down cross-legged, and closed his eyes. True energy swirled around him, and the dragon scale armor plates undulated with the pulse of his power.

He sank his mind into his body, clearly sensing the Ten Extremes true energy rushing like a river, gushing forth from the Primordial Chaos True Seed at the intersection of flesh and blood, and flowing through his entire body.

Wherever the true energy passed, his flesh and skin took on a jade-like luster, and his muscles, bones, and organs resonated with a humming vibration. Every cycle subtly conformed to the rhythm of heaven and earth.

This true energy was incredibly profound.

The Ten Extremes true energy contained various characteristics, following the path of ten thousand laws converging into one. The scorching heat of fire burned away impurities, the freezing cold of ice condensed the meridians, the hardness of metal tempered the bones, and the vitality of wood nourished the organs...

Ten completely different types of energy, unified under the command of the Primordial Chaos True Seed, formed a seamless whole. They even began to automatically absorb the surrounding spiritual energy during the circulation of the Heavenly Cycle.

Xu Yunfan could even "see" that as the true energy flowed, the pores on his skin opened and closed, creating subtle ripples that swallowed the free-floating spiritual energy within thirty zhang like a whale drinking the sea.

But...

Why was it different from the meridian systems described in the novels of his previous life? In this world's martial path, true energy flows through the flesh and blood.

Until now, Xu Yunfan naturally understood where the ultimate limit of the martial path lay.

This world's martial path was vastly different from the meridian theories of his past life. The Ten Extremes true energy did not follow the meridians; instead, it used the flesh and skin as rivers and streams, the muscles and bones as mountains, and the organs as the source.

The Primordial Chaos True Seed acted as the nexus of heaven and earth, fusing blood and qi with spiritual energy to forge true energy. Every cycle took place within the flesh and blood.

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes. Golden light seemed to flow within his pupils before returning to deep darkness in an instant.

He lowered his head and gazed at his hand.

His fingers were long and slender, with distinct joints. It looked no different from an ordinary person's, yet it had long since transcended the mundane.

Golden muscles and jade-like meridians, mercury blood and silver marrow, a water-and-fire immortal robe protecting his body, and the circulation of the Heavenly Cycle gathering qi like a whale drinking the sea...

This physical body had already reached the ultimate limit of the Eighth Stage of the martial path.

"Having cultivated the martial path to this point, what further method of advancement is there?"

He whispered softly, his fingertips tracing his chest.

The dragon scale armor, sensing its master's aura, receded layer by layer like a living creature, revealing the long-silent Extreme Dao Remnant within.

A physique at the peak of the Ninth Stage, true energy as abundant as an abyss or a sea, yet he remained unable to break through that invisible barrier.

What good would another sixty years of cultivation do? A quantitative change could not ultimately trigger a qualitative transformation.

"Above the Ninth Stage... Earth Immortal..."

Xu Yunfan’s gaze sharpened. His fingertips unconsciously stroked the smooth, delicate texture of the Remnant's surface.

How did those legendary existences cross the great chasm, pushing the mortal flesh and blood to a higher level?

Unfortunately, he could not leave Yujing City for the time being. Once he left, he would not only ruin the grand plan in Yujing City but also suffer the backlash of the Xuanhuang Qi.

Otherwise, he would have liked to rush back to the Dao Sect to ask his master, Bi Yuan, how to cultivate beyond the Ninth Stage.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan’s mind stirred, and he opened the latch of the steel mechanism box behind him.

"Pop!"

A smooth, round head suddenly popped out. The Ginseng Baby, whose beard had been completely plucked, glared with wide eyes and let out a series of sharp "squeaks," looking exactly like a wild cat whose tail had been stepped on.

The indignant posture seemed as if it wanted to spew out all the resentment of being plucked bald these past few days.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged. He treated it as background noise and habitually curled his fingers, intending to pull on the ginseng beard as usual, but his movement suddenly froze.

His fingertip hovered over the Ginseng Baby’s shiny forehead, with nowhere to land.

"The ginseng beard... pulled completely clean?"

He raised an eyebrow, showing a rare hint of surprise.

His gaze shifted downward, looking at the Ginseng Baby, and gradually became dangerous.

He wondered if, with his current strength as a Grandmaster of the Ninth Stage of Qi Refining, he could withstand swallowing this Ginseng Baby in one bite.

The Ginseng Baby was extremely sensitive and naturally felt Xu Yunfan’s dangerous gaze. The squeaking stopped abruptly, and it retracted its head into the mechanism box, refusing to show itself again.

Xu Yunfan suppressed this thought for now. He still needed to secure the imperial examination matters. If he swallowed it recklessly and something unpredictable happened, it would only cause unnecessary complications.

Old man Bi Sheng should have left the city by now.

For now, there was no need to worry.

After silently cultivating the "Lin" character technique for a while, Xu Yunfan felt slightly agitated. He simply stood up, walked to the railing of the pavilion, and quietly watched Yujing City gradually sink into darkness.

That's right!

Xu Yunfan tapped the steel mechanism box at his waist. With a click of the mechanism, a jade slip popped out from a hidden compartment.

He picked up the jade slip he had obtained from Jiang Xu. It was as white as mutton fat and frozen snow, with star-like patterns etched on its surface.

Drawing on his experience from his previous life, Xu Yunfan was almost certain that this jade slip was extraordinary. He had obtained it before condensing true energy in his body, and he wondered what effect it would have now.

He sent a few strands of true energy from his fingertips, attempting to pour them into the jade slip.

"Hum!"

A low, vibrating sound suddenly rang out. This ancient jade slip actually emitted a faint light, but aside from that, there was no other change.

Xu Yunfan frowned, realizing something. He pressed the jade slip to his forehead and sent out his true energy again.

The Ten Extremes true energy transformed into a torrent and rushed in.

In an instant, a scene exploded before his eyes.

A long time passed. Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes, his gaze filled with both joy and surprise, yet also a hint of astonishment.

Inside the jade slip, there was indeed a cultivation method called the "Dust of Extinction Heart Sutra"!

A true foundational method!

However, in Xu Yunfan's view, it was undoubtedly a demonic heart sutra.

"Sever the seven emotions as if dusting them away, extinguish the six desires as if brushing away sand."

This was a method that sought to exchange the elimination of human emotions for a qualitative change in spiritual power. Upon reaching great perfection, it would forge a foundation that could last for ten thousand lifetimes. The cultivator would be surrounded by the "Dao Rhyme of Extinction," and ordinary cultivators would suffer a collapse of their Dao Heart just by meeting their gaze. It was truly extraordinary.

Xu Yunfan stared intently at the "Dust of Extinction Heart Sutra" transmitted to his mind by the jade slip, his brows gradually knitting together.
