Chapter 311: Hunting Three Beasts Alone, Crushing the Prideful, White Face and Red Bow, Fame Spreads Across Feilong

Wang Dezhong's spirit was crushed, his mood heavy and dejected. He walked to the spot where the Snow Tiger had been shot, then suddenly froze in thought.

"The Snow Tiger's movements are unpredictable, and its fur blends with the snow. I was able to detect its tracks entirely due to my innate extraordinary eyes, which can discern minute traces. Even so, from five hundred zhang away, even if the Snow Tiger were hunting and running, it would be difficult to notice any signs. And this Snow Tiger was lying in wait, hidden in the snow. To find its tracks would be even more difficult, like finding a needle in a haystack or a grain of sand from a desert... He..."

"He not only possesses unbelievable archery skills, but his eyesight... to shoot a Snow Tiger dead from several miles away... that's simply... simply... too terrifying!"

He was speechless for a long time, his gaze flickering with complex emotions. By now, noon had passed, and dusk was approaching. Wang Dezhong had caught nothing. He thought of the appointment with the other prodigies and felt the shame of returning empty-handed. Since Snow Beasts were hard to find, he decided to hunt ordinary wild beasts instead.

When Wang Dezhong had washed away the impurities of his mortal body, he had awakened his "Green Eyes," a unique physique. His observation skills were keen, and his ability to track beasts was not shallow. He had dared to propose a hunting competition because he had some confidence in his abilities.

He hadn't searched for long before he saw a wild boar. Wang Dezhong raised his bow to shoot. The moment he nocked the arrow and pulled the string, a figure flashed through his mind. Suddenly, he felt a wave of self-loathing, frustration, and depression. The action was the same, yet the result was worlds apart. Wang Dezhong felt his own archery was shallow and childish, his posture ugly and embarrassing, a disgrace to behold.

"Archery... was born for people like him. For someone like me, am I even qualified to shoot? Even if I kill a wild boar, what of it? It's just amusing myself, what's the point? The Way of the Arrow is not my strength. Alas, from now on, I should just stop touching the bow!"

A sense of decay washed over him. He slowly released the string, let out a heavy sigh, snapped the arrow in two, and abandoned the hunt, turning back the way he came.

Li Xian, with the Snow Tiger slung over his shoulder, knew nothing of Wang Dezhong's defeat or how his spirit had been crushed to the point where he dared not touch a bow again. He held no ill will toward Wang Dezhong; shooting down his arrow was simply because he knew the pride of a prodigy—such a person would never hand over his prey willingly.

He had to win first, then compete for the prey, to avoid trouble. Li Xian felt it was inconvenient to carry the tiger, so he looked around and saw a patch of dense weeds.

He hid the Snow Tiger in the grass, covered it with snow, and concealed it perfectly. The Snow Tiger's fur was snow-white, its blood a faint blue, and its scent carried a faint, sweet fragrance. Its entire body was a treasure, worth a great deal on the black market.

Li Xian then manipulated the surrounding Five Elements, making subtle changes to make the spot even harder to discover. He possessed the "Heavy Pupil," an extraordinary eye with incredible vision; no matter how something was hidden, he could spot the clues. Others would find it extremely difficult to notice.

After finishing this, seeing there was still ample time, Li Xian went to search for the "Snow Ape."

There was a "Snow Forest" in the mountains of Snow Dragon Mountain, where the vegetation was lush and the trees were tall and straight, their leaves like needles. A Snow Ape was hiding there. Zhou Shijie and Yue Kai were working together, searching within the Snow Forest.

Zhou Shijie said, "Your sect's Wind-Sniffing Nose is truly remarkable. Brother Yue, look, this is ape dung. The Snow Ape must be nearby!"

Yue Kai said, "Brother Zhou, the Snow Ape is cunning, has a strong life force, and is incredibly fast. When we find its tracks later, we'll attack from both sides. You shoot first, and if you don't kill it, I'll immediately follow up with an arrow!"

Zhou Shijie laughed, "Good! Though there's a先后 (order), the credit will be shared equally."

Both knew that hunting "Snow Beasts" was difficult. Zhou Shijie's tracking skills were shallow; after half a day, he had only hunted wild boars and pheasants, with only a wild deer being somewhat presentable. He secretly felt he was losing face; archery was not his strong suit, and his martial prowess was half a step behind the others. He met Yue Kai halfway.

Seeing Yue Kai had a rich haul, with many wild tigers and leopards, he asked the reason and learned that the Yue Mountain Sword Sect had a martial art called the "Wind-Sniffing Nose," which was excellent for tracking and identifying traces.

Zhou Shijie thought... if things continued this way, he would surely be overshadowed. So he tried to persuade Yue Kai to cooperate and hunt the "Snow Ape." If they succeeded, it could cover up his shortcomings. Moreover, hunting a Snow Beast would be a glorious achievement, and their peers would surely look at them with new respect.

Yue Kai also had the same intention. They cooperated in the search, using the Wind-Sniffing Nose to gradually trace the Snow Ape's tracks. They slowly approached the location, already drawing near quietly. Yue Kai suddenly said, "Brother Zhou, look quickly!" pointing to a tree branch.

The Snow Ape was sleeping on a tree branch. Zhou Shijie and Yue Kai were about a hundred zhang away. Their eyes met, and they nodded at each other. They split to the sides, using their lightness skills to approach. When they felt the distance was close enough, Zhou Shijie and Yue Kai nocked their bows and prepared to shoot.

Zhou Shijie shot first. The Snow Ape had keen hearing and immediately sensed it. It sprang from the tree at once, dodging the arrow. Yue Kai saw the opportunity and immediately shot another arrow. This arrow flew straight for its head, precise and fierce.

The Snow Ape's agility was unexpected; it twisted its body in mid-air and was still able to dodge. The arrow grazed its cheek, only scratching its fur but not hitting a vital spot. Zhou Shijie let out an "Aiyo," while Yue Kai stomped his foot in regret.

Zhou Shijie shouted, "Chase!" The two used their lightness skills and pursued at great speed. However, although the Snow Ape's speed was not as fast as theirs, its fur blended with the snow, and when it swung between the trees, it was extremely difficult to discern its direction.

The Snow Ape suddenly let out a long howl toward the sky, its cry shaking the air. The snow piled on the trees immediately rustled and fell, a dark mass pressing down on them. Zhou Shijie and Yue Kai thought, "This is bad," and wanted to use martial arts to disperse it, but then thought: "This would be against the rules. If others found out, even if we hunted the Snow Ape, we would lose face." They couldn't bring themselves to use martial arts and couldn't avoid it, so they were instantly buried under the thick snow.

The two struggled to dig themselves out, but by then the Snow Ape had already run far away, over five hundred zhang away, and it was swaying left and right, incredibly agile. It seemed all hope was lost.

Yue Kai was still unwilling to give up and nocked another arrow to shoot. His archery was precise and fierce, his skills proficient, but the Snow Ape was exceptionally intelligent and agile, swinging flexibly to dodge again. Zhou Shijie also nocked an arrow and shot. His archery was also not bad, mixing real and feint attacks, the arrow's path unpredictable.

Although it grazed the Snow Ape, the killing power was insufficient, only breaking the skin and fur. A minor injury and slight pain could not stop the Snow Ape's escape. Yue Kai and Zhou Shijie felt the difficulty and had already given up. Zhou Shijie tried to save face, saying, "Snow Beasts are indeed extraordinary. We weren't prepared enough for this, and the distance was too far. We can only let this beast live a while longer..."

Yue Kai sighed, "Using only archery to kill a Snow Beast is indeed extremely difficult. This Snow Ape is like that. As for the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox... I'm afraid..." He was only just realizing the difficulty of the task.

As they spoke, they suddenly heard a soft "thud," as if a heavy object had fallen from a high place. Yue Kai and Zhou Shijie followed the sound and saw that the Snow Ape had already been shot down, falling to the ground, twitching, its life gone.

The two exchanged a glance, both shocked and confused, not knowing what had happened. When they got closer to look, they saw a white-faced, red-bow man standing beside the Snow Ape's corpse. Zhou Shijie said, "Chase!"

The two hurried after him side by side. But they saw the white-faced, red-bow man turn left and right, going further and further away. The man carried the Snow Ape on his back, his white fur blending into the snowy scenery. The two stared intently, but suddenly felt a stabbing pain in their eyes. Hunting in the snow was a great strain on the eyes, so they had to stop and rub them, unable to pursue any further.

Yue Kai and Zhou Shijie exchanged a glance, feeling the situation was eerie and mysterious. They thought... among the prodigies they knew, was there such a person?

Meanwhile.

Gu Nianjun and Mu Hongchou had a plentiful haul. Seeing the sky was late, they prepared to return to the agreed-upon location. On the way back, Mu Hongchou suddenly said, "Sister Gu, look!"

Gu Nianjun looked and saw a bear's footprint in the snow. Mu Hongchou said, "This is a Snow Bear's print!" Gu Nianjun said, "Oh? I've long heard that Snow Dragon Mountain has a unique terrain that nurtures Snow Beasts, which are extremely difficult to hunt. My family's winter hunt preparations in previous years, when the wind and snow covered the mountain, often involved buying Snow Beast fur to put on other animals."

"Whoever hunts this beast is considered to have performed exceptionally well in the winter hunt, winning the top prize, and can receive rewards and favor. If there really is a Snow Bear, I'd really like to meet it!"

Mu Hongchou said, "Sister Gu, to be honest, I arrived in Feilong City before you all. At the time, I didn't know you, and had nothing to do, so I came here to hunt early. I encountered a Snow Bear once, but unfortunately, I was careless for a moment and let it escape." She spoke with deep regret, shaking her head and stomping her foot.

Gu Nianjun had already seen Mu Hongchou's archery, which was quite impressive and powerful. Hearing that even she found it difficult to hunt the Snow Bear, she couldn't help but find it strange: "Is the Snow Bear really that powerful? I've vaguely heard of this beast, but I never paid much attention."

Mu Hongchou said, "The Snow Bear is cunning and extremely skilled at camouflage. Its whole body is covered in special snow fur, which is tough and slippery, able to resist blades and arrows. No matter how excellent the archery, unless it's a specially made bow and arrow, or supplemented by martial arts, it's extremely difficult to kill with one arrow. Even if you use martial arts to assist, the Snow Bear has thick skin and strong flesh, a vigorous life force, and is still hard to kill with one arrow."

"And this kind of Snow Bear is born with a keen sense of killing intent. Among all Snow Beasts, it is one of the most troublesome. Sometimes, the moment you reveal your killing intent, it has already fled far away."

Gu Nianjun said, "I've heard something about this. There is a martial art called [Bear Heart Technique], which mainly trains the heart. The heart... connects with heaven and earth, its mysteries infinite. There is a move in this technique called [Snow Bear Forging Heart Stance], whose function is to sense danger in advance and avoid misfortune. It must have been derived from the Snow Bear. To practice this technique, one needs a heart different from an ordinary person; such a person is hard to find. But the Snow Bear is born with it."

Mu Hongchou said, "Therefore, the Snow Bear's heart is extremely valuable and is listed as a common treasure."

She took a sharp arrow from her quiver and pointed it at the Snow Bear's footprint, saying, "This Snow Bear's footprint is wide, very similar to the one I encountered that day. And Sister Gu, look, this footprint is lighter, but this one is heavier."

Gu Nianjun looked and saw it was indeed so, and asked, "Is its right foot injured?" Mu Hongchou said, "Yes. That day I encountered the Snow Bear, I used the essence of the [Wuwei Sword Art] to approach quietly."

Gu Nianjun said, "The Wuwei Sword Art... the basic martial art of the Hushan Sword Sect, aimed at restraining one's mind, revealing nothing." Mu Hongchou nodded, "If I had revealed even a fraction of killing intent, the Snow Bear would have fled long ago."

Mu Hongchou said, "Even so, when I approached within three hundred zhang, the Snow Bear immediately sensed it and began to flee in a frenzy."

"I figured it would be hard to kill with one arrow, so I wanted to shoot its right foot first, then track and hunt it down. Who knew that even though I hit its right foot, its speed was so fast that I still lost it. Now that we've encountered it again, Sister Gu... I must try again, no matter what."

Gu Nianjun said with curiosity, "Alright, let's follow the tracks. I really want to see what the Snow Bear is capable of!"

The two women used their lightness skills, following the footprints. They saw the tracks were orderly; the Snow Bear had leisurely come out of its den and was walking towards a stream to drink. Mu Hongchou said joyfully, "If it's drinking, that's the best opportunity! Sister Gu, follow me."

The two women's steps were light, their boots leaving no trace on the ground; their lightness skills were extremely powerful. Following the tracks, Mu Hongchou's expression suddenly changed, and she said in a deep voice, "糟糕 (糟糕 - this was left in the text, but it means 'terrible' or 'too bad')."

Gu Nianjun said, "Someone has already set their sights on this bear." The two saw a faint footprint on a tree. The footprint was very light, but it had been noticed by Gu Nianjun.

Mu Hongchou said, "Let's follow and see." They followed the tracks for several more miles and saw the Snow Bear's footprints suddenly become chaotic, its steps larger and heavier.

Mu Hongchou stomped her foot and sighed, "It's over, it's over. That person secretly pursued it here and couldn't hold back any longer, revealing their killing intent. The Snow Bear, in its panic, has started to flee. In this case, it will be impossible to find it again."

She felt endless regret and looked into the distance, feeling extremely angry. "Another three hundred zhang and it would have reached the small river. If the Snow Bear had walked to the stream to drink, that would have been the perfect time to shoot it. This person is too reckless and foolish, to startle the Snow Bear here. It's truly despicable."

"Missing such a great hunting opportunity. If it were me, this Snow Bear would have been killed by now!"

Gu Nianjun observed the tracks in the snow and pointed in a direction. "The Snow Bear ran this way, let's follow and see." Mu Hongchou said sulkily, "It's useless. Once the Snow Bear is startled, it's impossible to hunt. This bear is cunning and agile, able to even dodge arrows. When it runs with its body close to the ground, its fur blends with the snow. At first, you can follow it with your keen eyes, but after a while, it becomes impossible to see, and you get dizzy. The vast snowfield反而刺痛双眼,损伤目力 (反而刺痛双眼,损伤目力 - actually hurts the eyes and damages eyesight)!"

"That bastard is truly detestable. If he hadn't interfered, I would have killed this Snow Bear! If I had hunted a Snow Beast, humph, they would all be so shocked they couldn't speak!"

Gu Nianjun smiled, "Let's follow and see anyway, maybe there's a turning point?" Mu Hongchou was still unwilling to give up. Even though she knew the hope was slim, she still followed the chaotic footprints. She saw occasional arrow marks along the way, some shot into the snow, some nailed to tree trunks, and couldn't help but feel very strange.

Mu Hongchou said, "This person is so strange. These few arrows are way off the mark, they didn't even touch the Snow Bear's fur."

Gu Nianjun said, "And there are only arrow marks, no arrow shafts. Did this person have the leisure to retrieve the arrows?"

They followed the tracks a little further. Every time Gu Nianjun found an arrow mark, she saw the Snow Bear had turned to flee. It didn't seem like a missed shot, but more like a... drive? She frowned, feeling extremely surprised and finding it不可思议 (不可思议 - inconceivable). "Something's not right... Is this person trying to drive the Snow Bear?"

Mu Hongchou shook her head. "Sister Gu, that's absolutely impossible. The Snow Bear is very cunning, it's hard enough to track it, let alone drive it?"

"And if this person really had the ability to drive it, it would mean he had the confidence to kill the Snow Bear at any time. If it were an old monster, using martial arts, it might be possible. But if that were the case, we would have noticed something from the arrow marks. Although we are young, we can't claim to understand all the martial arts in the world, but we can tell whether martial arts were used or not."

Gu Nianjun nodded slightly and was about to speak in agreement when she suddenly felt her throat tighten, the words stuck in her throat. She saw that the footprints here suddenly stopped, replaced by a large pit print. It was about two zhang long, shaped like a Snow Bear lying prone in the snow. The two women exchanged a glance and immediately went to observe. Seeing snow-white fur残留 (residue) in the pit, they confirmed that the Snow Bear was dead.

Mu Hongchou knew the Snow Bear's capabilities well. Seeing it dead here, she was speechless with shock and couldn't believe it. "This... how is this possible? This Snow Bear was fine, how did it suddenly die? What method was used?"

Gu Nianjun pondered and said, "It seems that person was indeed driving the Snow Bear. After driving it here, they shot it dead with one arrow, clean and decisive."

Mu Hongchou said, "Who... who has such archery skills? Could it be one of our companions?" Her eyes flashed with a strange light, uncertain and suspicious.

Gu Nianjun said with curiosity, "Perhaps. After all, we've only just met. It wouldn't be surprising if one of them has deep archery skills. If there really is such a person, maybe..." She thought of yesterday's events and her heart suddenly beat a little faster: "The one who helped Xiao Fan vent his anger yesterday, could it be the same person who shot the bear today? It's very likely. The one who shot the bear was thorough in his actions. The one last night was also like that. I rarely go out to meet friends. If I could make friends with such a person, it would be a great joy!"

Mu Hongchou said, "Sister Gu, let's go back quickly. I want to see who got there first. I'm going to cause some trouble for him!"

Gu Nianjun laughed, "This Snow Bear wasn't assigned to you. You have no reason to cause trouble for him."

Mu Hongchou said, "I'll just be unreasonable." Suddenly, her eyes shone: "If his archery can truly convince me, I must ask him for advice. If he used some other trick, I won't let him get away with it."

The two women returned empty-handed. After walking all day in the mountains of Snow Dragon Mountain, the tips of their hair, their foreheads, their backs, and their boots were all sweaty. Seeing they had left the mountain area, they both let out a long breath, feeling deeply exhausted. The two had set out in high spirits, but after the strange events, they had no mood for conversation, only curiosity and impatience.

Gu Nianjun said, "Sister Mu, let's go back to the inn quickly." Mu Hongchou nodded, not delaying any further, and rode her horse back. Along the way, she spoke very little, only the howling wind and snow and the sound of galloping hooves.

There was a 'Dream Return Inn' outside the east of the city, the meeting place for many prodigies.

At night, the wind and snow grew heavier. Inside the inn, the candlelight was bright. A dozen or so prodigies had already gathered, warming the charcoal fire, boiling fine wine, and chatting about interesting matters. Gu Nianjun and Mu Hongchou pushed the door open and entered. Seeing the two beauties return, everyone's eyes lit up.

Zhou Shijie said, "Nianjun, Hongchou, come and sit quickly," pointing to a few empty seats beside him. Mu Hongchou let out a soft "Hmph," and said, "Sister Gu, let's go sit over there," pulling Gu Nianjun towards the many women of the Hushan Sword Sect.

The women laughed and teased each other. The atmosphere was very harmonious. As the time grew late, prodigies returned one after another. Around the hour of Hai (9-11 PM), all the prodigies had arrived. They drank and talked, the scene joyful and harmonious. Mu Hongchou thought: "Who among you hunted that Snow Bear, I'll find out soon." Her gaze swept over everyone one by one.

The prodigies were puzzled but not annoyed. They secretly tidied their clothes and combed their long hair.

Zhou Shijie called the waiter and asked for three pots of clear water, placing them over the charcoal fire to heat. He said, "We hunt and eat what we hunt, that's the real fun. Everyone, please show your haul. Let's take advantage of the freshness and get it into the pot quickly."

Hearing this, everyone presented their gains. Yang Wentian had the most abundant haul, having hunted three tigers and two bears... When he took out his trophies, the surrounding prodigies gasped in succession, praising him.

They said Yang Wentian was exceptionally brave and strong.

For a martial artist, killing a tiger or hunting a bear is not difficult. But hunting with a bow has nothing to do with fighting skills; it doesn't require close combat, but requires hitting the beast's body with an arrow. And as wild beasts grow older, eat more, and are nurtured by the landscape... they also grow stronger day by day. Their intelligence, strength, speed... are also extraordinary.

Hunting with a bow alone is not easy. That's why large families have activities like "Winter Hunt" and "Spring Hunt." It's because hunting can cultivate one's blood and heroic spirit. Because the difficulty is high and there are many obstacles, it better reveals one's skill and capability.

Yang Wentian skinned the beasts on the spot, cut off the bear's paws, and摘下 (摘下 - plucked) the tiger's heart, throwing them into the clear soup, adding the first ingredients. The prodigies returned from the hunt, and this meal had both wine and meat. It didn't seek fine flavor, but rather the wildness and untamed nature.

Yang Wentian started... and others presented their haul one by one. They cut off the most precious parts of each beast and threw them into the clear water soup. Then they added cooking wine and seasoning spices... The aroma of the meat filled the air, a mix of fishy and sweet scents.

This feast of wine and meat was not about taste, but about eating wildness. Hua Wu, Zhou Ting... all had abundant hauls: leopards, boars, cows, eagles... all were plentiful. A pot of fresh soup contained dozens of fierce and large beasts.

It could truly be called a "Hundred Beasts Strange Soup," a supreme yang and pure soup.

Whenever someone hunted a large beast, everyone would cheer. Gu Nianjun and Mu Hongchou also presented their hauls, which drew even more applause, praising their excellent archery and methods.

Zhou Shijie noticed Wang Dezhong drinking alone and asked, "Brother Wang, Brother Wang, you're the only one left. Why don't you show your haul? I heard your fellow disciples from the Jiushan Sword Sect say that you have innate extraordinary eyes, and in hunting fierce beasts, you are top-notch!"

Gu Nianjun and Mu Hongchou looked at each other, both thinking: "If he has extraordinary eyes, he could track the Snow Bear. Could the one who shot the Snow Bear be this Wang Dezhong?"

Wang Dezhong shook his head. "I didn't hunt anything."

Everyone laughed upon hearing this, saying Wang Dezhong was being modest, his haul must be excellent, trying to praise himself by pretending to be humble. Mu Hongchou put her hands on her hips and said, "Brother Wang, don't be modest. Quickly take out that Snow Beast."

Gu Nianjun cupped her hands and smiled. "Brother Wang's archery is fantastic, Nianjun admires you. After the banquet, could I pay you a visit?"

Zhou Shijie, Yue Kai, Yang Wentian, and the others heard the words "Snow Beast" and all turned their gazes. Zhou Shijie, hearing that Gu Nianjun wanted to pay a visit, her words carrying a sense of admiration, felt even more concerned. He had been interacting with her for a long time but had never received such treatment.

Wang Dezhong's expression changed. "You all know?"

Mu Hongchou said, "Of course." Wang Dezhong sighed. "I didn't want to bring this up again, but since you already know, I might as well not hide it."

He walked over again and untied his meat bag. He shook it on the ground, and it was empty. Zhou Shijie asked in surprise, "Brother Wang, where is your haul?"

Wang Dezhong looked embarrassed. "I told you, I have no haul. Since Sister Mu also knows about this, let Sister Mu explain."

When Yang Wentian returned to the inn, he saw Wang Dezhong already drinking sorrowfully. When he spoke to him, Wang Dezhong was always very quiet. Knowing he had something on his mind, he asked, "Could it be that your haul was snatched away?"

Wang Dezhong didn't speak. Everyone looked at Mu Hongchou.

Mu Hongchou took a step back and exchanged a look with Gu Nianjun, both feeling completely baffled. "What are you talking about? Brother Wang... your business has me completely confused."

Wang Dezhong was stunned. "You already know? That expert... didn't tell you about this?"

It turned out... he had also guessed that the white-faced, red-bow man was one of their companions. Hearing that Mu Hongchou knew the details of the matter, he assumed the white-faced, red-bow man had already told her.

Mu Hongchou frowned. "What person?" Wang Dezhong laughed wryly, realizing he was being overly sensitive and had misunderstood. He laughed, "It's fine if you don't know, it's fine if you don't know. Then let's just say I lost. Anyway... I won't be shooting arrows anymore."

Gu Nianjun keenly sensed something was off and was extremely curious. "Brother Wang, what exactly happened to you, to make you so dejected?"

Zhou Shijie, Yang Wentian, Yue Kai... the many junior and senior brothers and sisters of the Five Great Sword Sects, Luo Feiyan... all were extremely curious and kept pressing for details.

Wang Dezhong saw there was no more hiding, and the alcohol was slightly going to his head. "Alright, alright... since that's the case, I'll talk about it. If I tell you this, you'll all be shocked out of your wits. Before today, I never imagined that among our peers, there would be someone with such terrifying archery skills."
