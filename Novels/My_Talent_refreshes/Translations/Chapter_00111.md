# Chapter 111: Mutation

"For low-grade, high-rank talismans, I have Fiery Flame Talismans, Cloud-Soaring Talismans, and Flowing Light Ice Shield Talismans."
"The first two types are twenty spirit stones each, and the latter is twenty-five low-grade spirit stones each. Which do you need?"
As he spoke, Chu Ning took out three types of talismans from his storage bag.
The middle-aged man looked them over and then said, "Three Fiery Flame Talismans, one Cloud-Soaring Talisman, two Flowing Light Ice Shield Talismans, plus ten Beast-Trapping Talismans, and five low-grade, mid-rank attack and five defensive talismans each."
"That'll be two hundred and fifty low-grade spirit stones altogether," Chu Ning said, taking out the talismans one by one and handing them to the man.
He then casually asked with a smile, "Fellow Daoist, buying so many talismans by yourself, could it be another beast tide is coming?"
The middle-aged man shook his head. "Not a beast tide, but recently, we have indeed found traces of some first-order high-grade demonic beasts near this mountain range. It's possible that after the last beast tide, these first-order high-grade demonic beasts didn't return to the Qingxia Mountain Range."
As he spoke, the middle-aged man took out a pile of spirit stones and placed them in front of Chu Ning.
He then picked up the talismans and said, "Before, these demonic beasts didn't really come out, so we couldn't easily discover them for a while. Recently, some demonic beasts have been appearing in the mountains west of the market, so I'm preparing to go with my companions to try our luck and see if we can hunt them down."
"I see," Chu Ning nodded.
Since the last beast tide had been hunted down for a period, the demonic beasts in this mountain range had indeed decreased. As a result, business at Yanji Market had also dropped significantly. He hadn't expected the demonic beasts to increase again these days.
West of the market, wasn't that the direction of his spirit fields?
Chu Ning immediately asked, "Are there many people in that area now?"
"Yes, rogue cultivators and people from various major families have been going there quite a lot these past few days," the middle-aged man replied with a smile. "Initially, I heard the Sun family even wanted to directly encircle and hunt in that mountain range, but they later found there were still too many demonic beasts. Moreover, there weren't just one or two first-order high-grade demonic beasts, so they weren't successful. Once the news spread, everyone started going."
After the middle-aged man left, Chu Ning stroked his chin.
Earlier, after being attacked by Yin Demon Sect members on his way back from Fengxia Market, Chu Ning had decided not to rush to his spirit fields for a while. But now, it seemed there wasn't a big problem. Yin Demon Sect members wouldn't choose to strike in crowded places, especially when there were many cultivators from surrounding immortal cultivation families. Of course, the most important reason was that Lin Changqing was in the market.

"Thinking about it this way, I can go cultivate those ten mu of spirit fields." Chu Ning thought to himself, remembering the Iron-Stem Orchid seeds he had bought from Fengxia Market. After all, those ten mu of spirit fields had been left barren for quite some time since the Purple Crystal Bamboo was harvested.
That day, Chu Ning continued to sell talismans intermittently. From these cultivators, Chu Ning also confirmed the middle-aged man's news.
After the market closed, Chu Ning went to the backyard to check. All fifty Iron-Stem Orchids had borne fruit, but each Iron Orchid Fruit only grew from a single flower, and only one fruit was produced per plant.
"Only fifty Iron Orchid Fruits. If I want to use these to temper my body later, this quantity is definitely not enough. I still need to plant Iron Orchid Fruits in those spirit fields. Even with my Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art and Little White helping to ripen them, it will take several months for these Iron Orchid Fruits to grow, bloom, and bear fruit." Chu Ning pondered as he looked at the Iron Orchid Fruits.
"I shouldn't delay too long. Since there's no major danger, why not take advantage of Lin Changqing being here these few days and plant the Iron-Stem Orchids first?"
So the next day, when Chu Ning saw cultivators flying towards the western outer mountain range, he also followed suit, flying with the wind. As the middle-aged man had said, he frequently encountered members of immortal cultivation families along the way. Especially near the spirit fields, as the adjacent mountain hollow was the Sun family's spirit field, Chu Ning even saw quite a few Sun family members.
Chu Ning confidently arrived at his own spirit fields. After all the Golden Yuan Fruits were picked, the fruit trees appeared normal for now. Chu Ning didn't rush to plant all the Iron-Stem Orchids. Instead, he first cast the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art on all the Golden Yuan Fruits, using the spell to stimulate them so they would bear fruit again.
Then, Chu Ning took out the Iron-Stem Orchid seeds from his storage bag and began to stimulate and plant them. Last time, Chu Ning had directly bought Iron-Stem Orchid seedlings from Yunhai Pavilion and hadn't needed to stimulate them. After trying it now, he found that the difficulty wasn't particularly high. Chu Ning, with his instantaneous casting speed, could stimulate a small handful of seeds with about ten uses of the stimulation art.
"It seems the real difficulty with Iron-Stem Orchids is blooming and bearing fruit; the rest isn't too big of a problem." Chu Ning, who had originally expected it to take some time, only spent a short while to stimulate all 100 Iron-Stem Orchid seeds.
However, Chu Ning didn't rush to plant them immediately. With ten mu of land, it wasn't strictly necessary to use the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art here for cultivation assistance. Chu Ning pondered for a moment and decided to slightly increase the planting interval.

"Let's see if this can increase the number of blooms and fruits." Because there were only a hundred seeds, even if the spacing was relatively sparser, the ten mu of land wouldn't be fully planted. Chu Ning planted Golden Yuan Fruits in the remaining areas.
He then performed the Sweet Rain Art to ensure these newly sprouted seedlings fully absorbed moisture. Following that, Chu Ning continuously cast the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art. The Iron-Stem Orchids could withstand many uses of the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art. Even with Chu Ning's cultivation, covering ten mu of land, he couldn't help but meditate and recover his spiritual power once in the middle before finishing casting spells over the entire ten mu.
At this moment, Chu Ning's gaze naturally fell upon Little White.
"Ying!"
Sensing Chu Ning's gaze, Little White let out another slightly aggrieved cry. Then, it obediently scurried to the Iron-Stem Orchids and began to ripen them. Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction at this sight.
For the next few days, apart from selling talismans when the market opened, Chu Ning spent most of his days in the spirit fields. He continuously cast the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art to help ripen the Golden Yuan Fruits and Iron-Stem Orchids.
During these days, various pieces of news also spread. Several rogue cultivators had successfully hunted a first-order high-grade demonic beast, the Fire Rock Spider, in the mountains. One immortal cultivation family had entered the mountains and encountered a pair of Blood-Spotted Unicorn Apes, suffering heavy losses.
...
These pieces of news weren't particularly important to Chu Ning. However, they did mean his talismans were selling well. Even the low-grade, high-rank talismans, which were extremely difficult to sell before, could now sell more than ten sheets each time the market opened.
What Chu Ning truly paid attention to was the news constantly coming from Lin Changqing and Du Han. As Lin Changqing had said, after that previous wave of attacks, the higher-ups of the Qingxi Sect were clearly enraged. It was said that most of the Foundation Establishment cultivators within the sect had been dispatched. Moreover, the Law Enforcement Hall had formed more than ten teams, fully cleansing the Yin Demon Sect members within the Qingxi Sect's sphere of influence. This also led to unearthing a batch of Yin Demon Sect disciples who had been lurking within the sect and among immortal cultivation families.
In addition to its own sect's actions, the Qingxi Sect also united with the other six major sects. The actions of the other sects were largely similar; even cultivators entering and leaving various markets had to undergo a thorough interrogation. Near the entire Qingxia Mountain Range, Yin Demon Sect disciples became targets for everyone.
The result of this was that for the next nearly one month, apart from the first few days when there were still reports of disciples being attacked, for the latter half of the month, there were no further reports of Qingxi Sect disciples being attacked while outside.

Under the combined purge of the seven major sects, news subsequently spread that a high-ranking devil cultivator from the Yin Demon Sect had sent a message to the seven major sects of the Qingxia Mountain Range. Yin Demon Sect disciples would all withdraw within a short period, and if the seven major sects of the Qingxia Mountain Range chose to attack at this time, the Yin Demon Sect would unite with other forces from the Bi-You Mountain Range and directly initiate a sect war.
Upon receiving this news, the major sects discussed it for a while and finally temporarily ceased their cleansing operations. Following this, a large number of Yin Demon Sect disciples left, and the Yin Demon Sect disciples seemingly vanished from the Qingxia Mountain Range. This was already one and a half months after Chu Ning returned from the sect.
Although from Chu Ning's perspective, if the Yin Demon Sect truly coveted the so-called spiritual seed discovered in the Qingxi Sect's forbidden ground, this matter would likely not end here. However, the temporary quiet period of the Yin Demon Sect brought Chu Ning considerable peace of mind. At least, whether he went out to his spirit fields or occasionally visited Fengxia Market, he didn't have to worry about too much danger.
Within Yanji Market, the faces of the Qingxi Sect members were no longer strained daily. Everything seemed to have temporarily returned to peace.
The only slight difference from before was that with a certain number of demonic beasts still remaining near the mountain range, more cultivators came to the market every day than when Chu Ning and the others first arrived. The market became increasingly lively, and many immortal cultivation families also began to expand their businesses within the market. The entire market even showed a subtle trend of flourishing and expanding outwards.
All of this didn't have a significant impact on Chu Ning. He continued his daily routine of cultivation, farming, and talisman crafting.
That day, after the market closed, Chu Ning went directly to the backyard and approached the Iron-Stem Orchids. At this moment, the Iron Orchid Fruits had fully ripened. These Iron Orchid Fruits were entirely brownish-red. Unlike the fresh fragrance of many spiritual fruits, these Iron Orchid Fruits subtly emitted a medicinal scent.
"It wasn't easy; they've finally ripened," Chu Ning sighed, looking at the fifty Iron Orchid Fruits. From the moment he bought them back from Fengxia Market until now, he had almost continuously used the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art to ripen them every day. In between, Little White had also ripened each plant once. Even so, it took several months for them to mature.
Chu Ning took out the jade box he had prepared long ago and carefully picked each Iron Orchid Fruit, placing it inside.
"Ying!" Little White watched Chu Ning pack the Iron Orchid Fruits one by one, and when only one was left, it finally couldn't help but cry out.

Chu Ning plucked the last one and tossed it directly into Little White's mouth. Little White immediately munched on it with a "crunch." The few large spiritual fruits Little White had obtained in the forbidden ground last time were eaten one every five days after returning to the market, finishing them quickly. However, it hadn't asked Chu Ning for spiritual fruits for some time, just eating spirit rice every day. Chu Ning had promised Little White this Iron Orchid Fruit before, and the little fellow clearly remembered.
Leaving the little creature in the backyard, Chu Ning himself returned to his room. He then prepared a small basin of water, intending to use the Iron Orchid Fruit for body tempering. Unlike the Bloodglow Grass Chu Ning had used before, and the Meridian-Opening Body Tempering Pills and Pure Yang Stone Powder he was currently using, this Iron Orchid Fruit body tempering method didn't involve soaking in a large amount of water. Instead, a small amount of water was used to dilute the fruit juice, which was then applied to the skin for absorption.
Chu Ning took an Iron Orchid Fruit from the jade box and squeezed it. The fruit showed no reaction, which slightly surprised Chu Ning. With his current cultivation in the Unbreakable Sinews stage, he could easily crush even incredibly hard stones. It was no exaggeration to say that, as long as they weren't body cultivators, cultivators of the same level would likely break a bone if Chu Ning squeezed them like this. Yet, this Iron Orchid Fruit's skin couldn't even be broken.
"No wonder Little White made a crunching sound when it ate it just now. This little fellow's teeth are quite hard," Chu Ning marveled, then applied more force and squeezed hard.
"Crack!"
With a cracking sound, the Iron Orchid Fruit was directly crushed by Chu Ning. The thick juice inside flowed into the basin. As the juice diluted, the water in the small basin turned the color of molten iron, and a medicinal scent filled the room.
After simply stirring it evenly, Chu Ning dipped his hand in and began to apply it to his body. Where it was applied, his skin turned a faint brownish-red. Chu Ning quickly applied the small basin of juice to his body. A burning sensation, from outside to inside, began to appear.
After carefully sensing it, Chu Ning immediately began to cultivate the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art. As Chu Ning cultivated, the brownish-red juice began to seep into his body. Gradually, Chu Ning's body surface returned to normal.
Chu Ning then stopped and immediately checked his body tempering progress.
[Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art (Yellow-grade, Low-rank), Third Layer (263/2100)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Unbreakable Sinews 133/1500]
[Spirit Refining Art, First Layer 565/1000]
The proficiency of Unbreakable Sinews increased by 1 point, consistent with the effect of the Meridian-Opening Body Tempering Pill, but the absorption speed for body tempering was faster.
"No, wait!" Chu Ning carefully sensed it again and felt that the effect of this single fruit was still better than that of the Meridian-Opening Body Tempering Pill.
Thinking this, Chu Ning took out another Iron Orchid Fruit. He then crushed and diluted it again, just like the previous one, and applied it once more. He also cultivated the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art again.
When Chu Ning checked his proficiency again, it showed:
[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Unbreakable Sinews 135/1500]
"Two Iron Orchid Fruits can increase Unbreakable Sinews proficiency by 3 points."
At this point, Chu Ning finally had a general understanding of the Iron Orchid Fruit's effects. In fact, each body tempering session could increase proficiency.
"If one considers the cultivation time for Iron Orchid Fruits, it's actually not very cost-effective. However, using this Iron Orchid Fruit also has its advantages," Chu Ning thought to himself.
Firstly, both the Meridian-Opening Body Tempering Pill and the Pure Yang Stone Powder's effects continuously weakened with increased usage. This was clearly stated in the descriptions he received when he bought them. Based on Chu Ning's usage experience over this period, after thirty consecutive days of daily use, the Meridian-Opening Body Tempering Pill's tempering effect would diminish to the point where it took six pills to gain five points of proficiency. Chu Ning hadn't yet tried the Pure Yang Stone Powder, but he expected its effect to be similar. Of course, this also had to do with Chu Ning's high frequency of use. After all, a typical body cultivator wouldn't be able to use spiritual medicines of this caliber for body tempering every day.
However, in all the information Chu Ning had read about Iron Orchid Fruits, including the data provided by Yunhai Pavilion, there was no mention of the tempering effect weakening. This implied that either the Iron Orchid Fruit's tempering effect would not weaken, or the reduction in effect was minimal. Furthermore, the Iron Orchid Fruit's absorption through application was significantly faster than the Meridian-Opening Body Tempering Pill's soaking method, making Iron Orchid Fruit tempering quite appealing to Chu Ning. After all, besides body tempering, Chu Ning also had other cultivation aspects that needed to progress simultaneously.
He decided to first use up the Meridian-Opening Spirit Pills and Pure Yang Ancient Stone Powder he had bought from Yunhai Pavilion, and then start using the Iron Orchid Fruits for body tempering. He had bought a 45-day supply of each at Yunhai Pavilion, which meant he could still use them for another one and a half months. Adding the more than forty Iron Orchid Fruits, he could use them for over two more months.

With these three months, the newly planted Iron Orchid Fruits would also have about five months of growth, making them basically ready for harvest. Of course, this premise required Chu Ning and Little White to continuously ripen the Iron-Stem Orchids. In fact, Chu Ning had largely been doing this for the past month and a half. For the Golden Yuan Fruits, Chu Ning generally cast the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art once a day, but for the Iron-Stem Orchids, he cast it several times a day. At the same time, Little White also stayed in the spirit fields with Chu Ning, fertilizing these Iron-Stem Orchids daily.
Chu Ning observed the growth of the Iron-Stem Orchids and estimated that they might bloom in less than a month. And indeed, just as Chu Ning expected, under his continuous, high-intensity spellcasting for ripening, the Iron-Stem Orchids almost bloomed in just another half a month, much earlier than Chu Ning had anticipated.
The Golden Yuan Fruits had already bloomed and borne fruit earlier, but their flowers would only wither after the fruits grew larger, so they were still hanging with flowers. Now, the Iron-Stem Orchids' flowers also opened. The spirit field had turned into a sea of flowers, which was very pleasing to the eye.
What delighted Chu Ning even more was that, just like the ones he had planted in his courtyard before, all these Iron-Stem Orchids had bloomed. This meant that all of them could bear fruit. What particularly pleased Chu Ning was that, perhaps due to the sparser planting, the number of flowers on each Iron-Stem Orchid plant was significantly more than those in the courtyard previously. Besides a very few plants that only bloomed once, the other ninety-odd plants had at least two flowers. Many had three, and the highest even had one plant that bloomed with five flowers.
One Iron-Stem Orchid flower meant one fruit would be borne. After just a quick count of the flowers, Chu Ning was overjoyed. Once this batch of Iron Orchid Fruits was harvested, he wouldn't have to worry about body tempering for a year.
Another half a month or so passed, and the Iron-Stem Orchids began to bear fruit, their flowers starting to wither. However, that day, when Chu Ning arrived at the spirit fields, he discovered something. The Iron Orchid Fruits growing on the twenty Iron-Stem Orchids near the Golden Yuan Fruits in the spirit field seemed different from the other Iron Orchid Fruits. These Iron Orchid Fruits, which should have been brownish-red, had developed a golden-yellow tint on their skin.
Recalling the situation where both types of spiritual fruits were blooming simultaneously for a period, a thought suddenly struck Chu Ning. "Could these two spiritual fruits have cross-pollinated and mutated?"
