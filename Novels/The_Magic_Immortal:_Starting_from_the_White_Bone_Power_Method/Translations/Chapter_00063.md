# Chapter 63: Plucking the Peach

Water droplets seeped from the cave walls above the river tunnel, falling onto the still surface at the edge and creating rippling circles. Yet the sound of water couldn't compare to the rippling effect of the female cultivator's voice in Wang Chan's heart, sending a tingling sensation through him as if wicked flames had been instantly ignited.

Wang Chan showed no haste. Instead, he maintained a stern expression as he slowly turned to face the robed female cultivator with his ordinary, rugged features. "How did Fellow Daoist Su see through my disguise?"

He was wearing the [White Ghost Mask] to alter his appearance and aura, supplemented by a mid-grade Illusion Talisman. Given that she was only an early-stage Qi Refining cultivator, she shouldn't have been able to see through it.

"Your aura," Su Jue replied, sitting up and crossing her legs in a posture that accentuated her figure. Her voice was soft as she spoke frankly, "Though Fellow Daoist Wang's methods are impressive, this humble woman has always been sensitive to auras—especially those of people I favor."

"Oh? Then between mine and He Changkong's, whose aura does Fellow Daoist Su find more... sensitive to?" Wang Chan asked with a faint smirk.

Su Jue, who had been quietly sitting there exuding charm, trembled slightly at his words. She gave Wang Chan a deep look before replying in an inexplicable tone, "Very few know that I am He Changkong's dao companion. I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Wang to be so resourceful, uncovering my identity just from my name."

Wang Chan chuckled but didn't respond, instead fixing her with a scrutinizing gaze.

Unexpectedly, meeting his eyes seemed to excite Su Jue. She bit her red lips, her face flushing as her eyes burned with barely restrained excitement. "What? Now that you know I'm He Changkong's dao companion, does Fellow Daoist Wang no longer dare to make a move?"

This woman...

Wang Chan's heart skipped a beat at her reaction. Why was she suddenly so excited?

Keeping his expression neutral, he replied coolly, "If I were afraid, I wouldn't have abducted Fellow Daoist Su in the first place."

"Revenge?" Su Jue's voice trembled slightly.

"He stole something from me."

"So you're worried I might be bait? Then, with Fellow Daoist Wang's formidable methods, have you found even the slightest trace of deception on me?"

"No."

"In that case, since He Changkong stole from you, why not steal from him in return... Fellow Daoist Wang, the honeyed spiritual peach is ripe..."

Her words sent a surge of primal heat through Wang Chan's veins.

Soon, the dry tinder was about to ignite.

But just then, Su Jue pushed against Wang Chan's chest and pleaded, "Could Fellow Daoist Wang... revert to your original appearance? With this rugged face, I fear I won't be able to... fully immerse myself..."

Seeing Wang Chan's puzzled look, she added, "Your eyes and nose resemble those of my childhood sweetheart... though he passed away many years ago. But if I must compare, Fellow Daoist Wang's nose is more... pronounced."

Wang Chan's face twitched at her words.

As expected—there was no such thing as unconditional affection in this world. Female cultivators didn't become infatuated simply because a man was handsome; there was always a reason behind it.

Then what about the beauty mark? What was its story?

Wang Chan quickly dismissed the thought and focused on Su Jue, frowning inwardly: In that case, even if I have her body, I won't have her heart.

But then he scoffed at himself, nearly slapping his own face. What nonsense—she wasn't his woman to begin with. As long as she served her purpose, why did he need her heart?

"If we're comparing, my strengths go far beyond just this..."

---

Nearly two hours later.

Su Jue lay curled beside him, savoring the afterglow of their union.

Wang Chan stood by the earthen barrier talisman's light shield, hands clasped behind his back as he gazed at the still waters at the cave's edge. Peering inward at his dantian, he saw an exceptionally dense mass of primal yin energy entwined with sixteen strands of spiritual power.

If he refined this yin energy, he could likely gain three additional strands of power.

The realization left him stunned.

Was He Changkong out of his mind? How could he leave a woman like Su Jue neglected and lonely?

Not only that, but his spiritual and physical energies now flowed smoother than ever, responding effortlessly to his will.

The last time he'd felt this way was after killing the white-robed female cultivator and the black-robed man.

"Kill those who deserve killing, and bed..."

A faint understanding dawned on him.

"This humble woman was originally a cultivator from Blackwater City. He Changkong killed that man and forcibly took me as his dao companion. Yet he... is incapable of performing his marital duties. For years, he's kept me locked away in solitude..."

Su Jue's sorrowful voice broke Wang Chan's reverie.

Her fate had indeed been cruel.

But why would He Changkong forcibly take her as his dao companion if he couldn't perform? 

Wang Chan frowned but ultimately didn't press further. "In that case, how will you explain things to He Changkong afterward?"

"Thank you for your concern, Fellow Daoist Wang." Su Jue discarded her scattered robes and donned a fresh apricot-yellow daoist robe. Her tone was unexpectedly calm as she said, "I have my own ways of handling it."

Wang Chan nodded.

"Though we met by chance, I will never forget your kindness, Fellow Daoist Wang. So this is what it truly means to be a woman..." Su Jue sighed softly before adding, "I must depart for White Mountain City today. Take care."

Having said this, she finished adjusting her attire, clearly preparing to leave.

"Where does He Changkong usually cultivate?" Wang Chan suddenly asked.

Su Jue paled, assuming he intended to confront He Changkong for her sake. She shook her head vehemently. "Fellow Daoist Wang, you mustn't act recklessly! I know your methods are extraordinary, but He Changkong is unfathomably powerful. You must not provoke him. Having experienced this once is enough for me."

"Where can I find He Changkong?" Wang Chan pressed.

Su Jue froze, realizing she had misread the situation. He wasn't seeking He Changkong for her sake—he had abducted her as part of his search for He Changkong.

A pang of loneliness struck her. This man truly was heartless.

But she understood. She was but a fleeting encounter to him, and their exchange had been purely transactional. What room was there for sentiment?

"He Changkong never reveals his whereabouts when alone—not even to me," Su Jue murmured. "Even on ordinary days, I rarely see him."

Seeing Wang Chan's reluctance to give up, and recalling his earlier... attentions, her heart softened, and she urged him once more: "Fellow Daoist Wang, heed my advice—do not seek him out. He... will kill you!"

As she spoke, Wang Chan's eyebrows suddenly shot up. His expression shifted as he swiftly turned toward the tunnel entrance. Instinctively, he slapped a mid-grade protective talisman onto himself and another onto Su Jue.

In the next moment, a bloody figure began seeping out from the damp cave walls above, piece by piece, until it fully materialized just beyond the earthen barrier's defenses—revealing the form of He Changkong.

At the sight of him, Su Jue's face turned deathly pale. Her already weakened legs gave out, and she collapsed onto the jade bed, one hand landing in a slick patch—though she paid it no mind.

Meanwhile, He Changkong, having just arrived, took in the scene of Wang Chan and Su Jue still fully clothed—apparently having not yet gotten to business—and grinned in relief.

"A-Jue, did I arrive at an... inopportune time?"
