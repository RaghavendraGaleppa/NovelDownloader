# Chapter 238: Something Big Has Happened

"Something's likely happened again!" someone said with a grim face. They were responsible for information gathering and personnel deployment, and now they wished they could intervene themselves. A few of them couldn't hold back anymore; even if it was already too late to rush over, they still wanted to act.

***

Qin Ming was very displeased. He pressed Cui Qing about the "World-Dwelling Scripture" but was disappointed with the result.

"You little brat..." Cui Qing was still yelling in his last moments.

"What good are you?" Qin Ming chopped him down with a single blade, instantly turning him into a headless corpse. Next, he shot down a spirit bird in the night sky, tidied up the battlefield, and then quickly departed.

He wasn't entirely without gains; he obtained a fragmented part of the "World-Dwelling Scripture." This was because Cui Qing hadn't fully cultivated it; he had just entered the Spirit Field Realm and hadn't acquired the complete scripture. The Cui family's "World-Dwelling Scripture," with detailed annotations, was divided into four volumes, accessible to all direct descendants for study. Cui Qing had only cultivated the first volume.

"From another perspective, it's good to have any gains at all," he muttered. "Besides, at my current level, I can't cultivate the 'World-Dwelling Scripture' anyway; I mostly focus on unique techniques. I'll get the other three volumes if I get a chance later. In the future, if I see any Green Hairs, I'll hunt them down."

Since the Cui family had withheld his family's inherited silk manuscript, Qin Ming was preparing to investigate their "World-Dwelling Scripture," considering it a "return of courtesy."

"Today I've killed two groups of the Cui family, some of whom were their direct descendants. This feud has become massive." He sighed, "The tree desires peace, but the wind will not cease." However, he had nothing to fear. Since they were on opposing sides, it was either their death or his. There was no way for things to end well, and retreating was useless.

He was sure that the Cui family was determined to eradicate him. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been so decisive this time, sending wave after wave of people.

"Are they preparing for a large-scale war?" Qin Ming judged based solely on the available information. Regardless, the Cui family had come with malicious intent. This was a severe reality, and he needed to consider how to survive.

"It seems the identity of Shen Wubing has been completely exposed and is now known to the Cui family." Qin Ming reflected. All the identities he had used had once become renowned: Qi Zizai of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, Yao Yi in the Secret Realm, and now Shen Wubing – all mysterious and powerful. He pondered that if people knew he had mastered the silk manuscript technique, he might become famous, but his future situation would be precarious, and he would face even more crises.

At this moment, another person was likewise lamenting their situation after an identity change. Li Qingxu, wearing a mask, suffered another crushing defeat after a fierce battle with Xiao Wu. He was now on a ten-loss streak in his life, having lost two matches just today. Nearby, both demons and human cultivators were astonished by the two's power, believing they both had extraordinary backgrounds.

The "Masked Man" identity had certainly become renowned here today, and while truly not weak, he had appeared rather pathetic. Li Qingxu felt dejected. How was it that any random opponent he encountered could defeat him? At this moment, he even began to doubt life itself.

"You're strong, but you're a notch below me, and two notches below my brother. Oh, and he's my age," Xiao Wu commented.

Upon hearing this, Li Qingxu nearly spat out a mouthful of old blood. The other party had a brother? This meant that if he truly wanted to challenge all corners, he was still one defeat short!

"What?! Qingxu... lost again?" When the Li family received the news, many were numb with shock. If this continued, would the "Immortal Seed" valued by the family be ruined? Many people's faces turned grim. How could there be so many young monsters on the plateau?

"From now on, I am Li Bai (Li Defeat)!" On that day, Li Qingxu officially renamed his masked identity. However, the fire in his eyes had not extinguished. Instead, he recalled what his master, Cao Qianqiu, had said: "Break and then stand!"

***

"It's confirmed, Cui Qing is dead!" Cui Changming, Cui Cheng, and others felt a tightness in their chests after receiving the report. In such a short time, direct descendants had repeatedly died; the Cui family's dignity was being openly challenged!

"What level is the person protecting Qin Ming truly at?" Someone's face darkened, preparing to mobilize forces for retaliation.

Cui Cheng spoke, "I suspect they haven't surpassed the Third Realm. After all, according to the spirit birds' feedback, it wasn't an instant kill each time, but involved a struggle." To obtain information, many "useless birds" were sacrificed. Any spirit bird that even slightly approached that area, even extremely fast ones like lightning sparrows and thunder falcons, would be shot down. So later, the Cui family's spirit birds merely listened from afar, not daring to fly closer to spy.

"I will go personally!" Cui Changming declared, truly unable to sit still any longer.

"We'll go too. We can confirm it's not someone from the Fourth Realm protecting him, so we should be more than capable of taking them down!" Others also chimed in, wanting to follow.

En route, several people received a heart-stopping piece of news: one of the Cui family's "seed teams" had gone to intercept Qin Ming and had already engaged.

"Wasn't Chongkong not in that area?" Cui Changming asked anxiously. Among the junior group, the Cui family had prepared ten teams, but only two were "seed teams."

Someone reported, "Chongkong and his group rushed over on an exotic bird after hearing the news, arriving later but reaching the front."

Cui Changming, Cui Cheng, and the others all had a bad feeling. Cui Chongkong was a youth highly favored by the older generation, and he was Cui Changqing's youngest grandson. Cui Changqing ranked second among those with 'Chang' in their name. He was a very influential figure in the Cui family, had progressed far on the immortal path, and had cultivated the "World-Dwelling Scripture" to a high level.

Cui Changming let out a furious shout. If anything happened to Cui Chongkong, he wouldn't be able to explain it to his powerful second elder brother – a person far more formidable than Cui Laowu.

***

Qin Ming had originally been on the run, not wanting to fight to the death with the Cui family here, as the situation was disadvantageous to him. His current priority was to preserve his life and survive on the plateau. However, he hadn't expected Cui Chongkong to pursue him on a flying beast. Since the other party wouldn't give him a way out, and he couldn't escape, he absolutely wouldn't show any mercy.

Cui Chongkong was half a year older than him, had joined the Esoteric Sect very early, possessed extremely high talent, and was very well-known in the Cui family. In the past, when he was in the Cui family, the older "cousins" who knew the inside story were relatively cold towards Qin Ming. Most of the Cui family's youths of similar age to Qin Ming had good relations with him, but Cui Chongkong was an exception, having been quite arrogant back then. Otherwise, Qin Ming might have held back.

Opposite him was a Green Hair, an old man with long green hair. Clearly, the Cui family was employing a "young-and-old pair" strategy this time, with a master following behind all the young individuals for protection.

Seeing this, Qin Ming immediately took the initiative and quickly advanced to meet them. He wanted to collect the "World-Dwelling Scripture." After the previous two attempts, he had expended a considerable amount but had also become more proficient. This time, he suddenly activated the Essence of Starlight, making his assault even more effective than before.

"You..." The old man was heavily wounded and turned to flee, but he couldn't escape at all.

"Green Hair, leave the scripture before you go!" Qin Ming pursued.

In this area, Cui Chongkong was shocked. Could the abandoned child from back then actually kill someone from the Third Realm? When facing him, Qin Ming showed no hesitation; he struck when he needed to. Cui Chongkong had pursued him, his intentions so clear, so Qin Ming was equally decisive and swift when slaying him.

A head, wide-eyed with terror, flew into the air. Cui Chongkong's eyes were splitting with rage and disbelief. His body stiffened there, weakly reaching out in his final moments, but he had already "lost his head." He was only six months older than Qin Ming, had recently broken through to the mid-Second Realm, and his cultivation was quite profound, yet he couldn't withstand the abandoned child's Skyglow Force. His divine consciousness had not yet extinguished, and he tried to struggle, but found himself ignited by that Skyglow.

"Is this the Skyglow cultivated from the silk manuscript technique? It's even more terrifying than the Tathagata Force or the Six Imperial Force!" This was Cui Chongkong's last thought before death, filled with shock and regret. He truly shouldn't have come here.

Ultimately, Qin Ming obtained the first two volumes of the World-Dwelling Scripture, effectively acquiring the first half. He was quite satisfied, muttering to himself, "This is enough for now. The latter half is researched by old farts and requires extremely profound cultivation to support it." Once he reached that level, with his strength already established, would he still worry about not getting the latter half of the World-Dwelling Scripture?

In the night sky, Cui Changming, Cui Cheng, and others felt their vision darken, for they had already learned that the Cui family's third team had been annihilated.

"Chongkong is dead?!" At this moment, all their faces were extremely grim. Some even had cold sweat beading on their foreheads. Before coming to the plateau, everyone had high hopes for Cui Chongkong, but instead of obtaining the auspicious blood, he had died!

***

Under the cover of night, a high-grade exotic bird flew far away and quickly found Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan.

"I feel something is wrong. That young man has killed three groups in a row, each with a Third Realm master. I'm afraid he might end up in trouble, so I hurried to deliver the message."

Yu Gensheng was shocked, saying, "What are you talking about?" Qin Ming killing a Third Realm master? This was simply like something out of "One Thousand and One Nights."

Zhao Ziyuan also grew anxious, asking, "Why didn't you tell us sooner?"

The high-grade exotic bird replied, "Didn't you say that if he could overcome the obstacle himself, even if he suffered heavy injuries or his head bled, as long as his life wasn't in danger, I didn't need to intervene? Later, I was truly alarmed by what I saw, so I came to tell you." It was in the Third Realm, circling above the plateau, responsible for keeping an eye on Qin Ming and Xiao Wu. Undoubtedly, Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan had placed great hopes on the two youths, which was why they were so diligent. Precisely because this fierce bird was of a higher realm and very far away, Qin Ming had only briefly glimpsed it and couldn't shoot it with his bow.

"Why are you such an honest bird? He's killed people from the Third Realm, and you didn't report it sooner? This... this isn't real. Is this some kind of demonic disturbance? Something big is going to happen!"

"Lead the way quickly!" The two old men were completely exasperated and rushed off in a flurry.

Cui Changming, Cui Cheng, and others were all radiating killing intent, a suffocating frustration brewing in their chests as they advanced towards their destination.

At this moment, Qin Ming was running at high speed across the plateau, traversing the night fog. Having killed three groups of the Cui family, he naturally knew the impact was immense, and the other party was absolutely furious.

"He should have fled in that direction!" Cui Changming, Cui Cheng, and others were rapidly approaching.

Demons on the plateau were bleeding and fleeing, while people from various major forces were pursuing them. This area was extremely chaotic. And for now, most people paid no attention to the Cui family's pursuit.

"Troublesome... the Cui family!" Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan rushed in, agitated, already spotting that small group of masters in the distance.
