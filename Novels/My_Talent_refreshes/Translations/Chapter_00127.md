# Chapter 127: Spiritual Resonance Outburst

"This is the Formation Site, not some large village?"

Chu Ning gazed at the scene before him, a hint of doubt in his eyes. He had originally imagined the Formation Site to be a grand and imposing place. Yet, what met his gaze were countless thatched huts, thousands of them, stretching one after another.

"More fellow disciples have arrived? Come, come, follow me."

As Chu Ning was pondering this, a familiar voice rang out.

"Senior Brother Zhuang?"

Chu Ning immediately recognized the chubby face. In fact, he wasn't the only one; many other disciples recognized him too. After all, many of the disciples who entered with Chu Ning's group were service disciples from the Spirit Plant Hall.

Upon hearing their calls, Zhuang Yunde immediately smiled, cupped his hands towards everyone, and greeted them warmly. When his gaze fell upon Chu Ning, he paused slightly.

"Oh, Junior Brother Chu is here too?"

As he spoke, Zhuang Yunde seemed to recall something, his expression becoming somewhat complex. Chu Ning couldn't quite grasp what he meant, so he simply cupped his hands and greeted Zhuang Yunde.

Zhuang Yunde smiled in response, then addressed the crowd, "Everyone, follow me. Once we enter this place, there are no more separate halls. Everyone will live according to the different attribute cultivation methods they practice. This time, all the new arrivals are fellow disciples with wood-attribute cultivation methods, so the sect has specially arranged a place for us."

After speaking, Zhuang Yunde turned and walked forward. The group followed Zhuang Yunde into the Formation Site, only to discover that it was meticulously organized inside. The thatched huts were arranged in neat rows, with almost identical spacing.

Passing through several pathways between the thatched huts, Zhuang Yunde led the group to a relatively spacious area. At this moment, some people were already busy constructing their thatched huts.

Zhuang Yunde pointed and said to everyone, "This is where all of you will be living for the foreseeable future. Take your number plaque, go to your designated plot, and you can start building your hut. For unified management, everyone's huts should be built to match the size of the existing ones."

"Senior Brother Zhuang, we have to build these houses ourselves?" A slightly unfamiliar disciple, whom Chu Ning was observing, asked Zhuang Yunde.

Zhuang Yunde smiled at him. "Everyone does. Even inner sect senior brothers who came before had to do it themselves. Surely, junior brother doesn't think he's more noble than an inner sect senior brother, do you?"

Upon hearing Zhuang Yunde's words, the disciple's face flushed with embarrassment, and he said no more.

Zhuang Yunde then handed out bamboo slips to everyone. Chu Ning received a plaque marked "Wood Nine Hundred Nineteen" and quickly found his corresponding plot of land—a five-zhang square piece of earth.

With just a glance, Chu Ning saw other fellow disciples cutting trees and gathering grass from a short distance away. He immediately knew what to do and followed suit, digging up some earth, felling a few trees, and collecting a good amount of grass. Then, on plot Wood Nine Hundred Nineteen, he began constructing his earthen-brick and thatched hut.

While they had no specialized tools, for cultivators like Chu Ning, who knew many minor spells, it was clearly not an issue. Blade Edge Arts could cut the earthen bricks into shape, and Drying Spells could quickly dry the bricks, wood, and grass. A flurry of activity quickly ensued as everyone worked enthusiastically.

As Chu Ning was building his dwelling, a figure slowly approached.

"Junior Brother Chu."

Hearing Zhuang Yunde's voice, Chu Ning immediately stopped, a smile on his face. "Senior Brother Zhuang, I was just thinking of finishing this hut and coming to visit you. I didn't expect you'd come to me first."

Zhuang Yunde waved his hand. "No need to be so polite between us."

As he spoke, Zhuang Yunde looked at Chu Ning, his expression complex, and said, "I truly didn't expect that after more than a year, Junior Brother would already reach the sixth layer of Qi Condensation. This cultivation speed is indeed not slow. What a pity."

Chu Ning was slightly startled, and he asked with a somewhat serious expression, "Senior Brother, what's a pity? Is there some unspoken rule within this Formation Site, that we won't be able to leave once we're in?"

Zhuang Yunde was momentarily stunned, then replied, "When I said 'pity,' I meant that Junior Brother actually consumed a Boundary Breaking Pill. Did Junior Brother not keep that in mind?"

Hearing Zhuang Yunde's words, Chu Ning couldn't help but chuckle. "Ah, so Senior Brother was talking about that. To be frank, I only just broke through to the sixth layer of Qi Condensation right before entering the Spirit Domain, so I haven't consumed that Boundary Breaking Pill."

"Oh?" Zhuang Yunde sized up Chu Ning, and the look of pity on his face immediately vanished, replaced by surprise. "So Junior Brother has already cultivated to the sixth layer of Qi Condensation! This cultivation speed is truly astonishing. I heard from some people in the Spirit Plant Hall that many fifth-layer Qi Condensation disciples improved this time by taking Boundary Breaking Pills. I thought Junior Brother was the same, which was a pity."

Chu Ning smiled and said, "It was just luck, right at the cusp of a breakthrough." As he spoke, Chu Ning also observed Zhuang Yunde, noticing that he was still at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation and hadn't broken through.

Curious, Chu Ning asked, "Senior Brother Zhuang, what exactly are we doing here in this Spirit Domain? Why are there so many fellow disciples?"

Zhuang Yunde's expression turned complicated again upon hearing this, but he didn't conceal anything. "Even if I don't tell you these things, other senior brothers will tell you in a few days. All I know is that by entering this Spirit Domain, our task is to activate the Five Elements Qiankun Formation to force the Spirit Seed to appear. It's said that this Spirit Seed is useful for Golden Core stage and even Nascent Soul stage cultivators to break through, but what exactly it's for, I'm not clear."

As he spoke, Zhuang Yunde pointed to the area directly in front of them. "Look, over there, there's already a group of fellow disciples activating the formation. This formation needs to be continuously stimulated year-round, and it requires thousands of disciples at once. When one group of disciples exhausts their cultivation base, another group immediately takes over."

"A formation driven by thousands of people?" Chu Ning exclaimed in surprise upon hearing this.

Zhuang Yunde nodded, sighing, "Indeed, I was quite surprised when I first heard it after entering this place. It's said that even Golden Core stage cultivators would need the combined strength of several individuals to activate this formation. Because only Qi Condensation stage cultivators can enter this Spirit Domain, the sect somehow modified it, allowing us Qi Condensation cultivators to activate it, though it requires a larger number of people."

Chu Ning now generally understood. It turned out that where they were wasn't the true Formation Site, but merely the living quarters for the disciples in the outer perimeter.

After gaining a rough understanding, Chu Ning asked Zhuang Yunde again, "Senior Brother Zhuang, can we still leave? Why was it said before that if we could leave this place, we would directly become inner sect disciples?"

At this, Zhuang Yunde's face showed a bitter smile. "Your question was actually my biggest concern when I first entered, but, after I truly understood, sigh..."

Despite his sigh, Zhuang Yunde painstakingly explained everything to Chu Ning. It turned out that under the pressure of the Five Elements Qiankun Formation, the Spirit Seed would unleash a Spiritual Resonance Impact every few years. During such an impact, a significant portion of the disciples activating the formation would be affected. Some would be directly crushed to dust by the spiritual energy waves of the impact, while a fortunate few would not only survive but also obtain a wisp of Spiritual Resonance Qi.

According to the sect's supervisor here, this Spiritual Resonance Qi can improve one's cultivation talent; it's said to be able to cleanse and purify one's spirit root.

As long as one obtains this wisp of Spiritual Resonance Qi, their cultivation speed can advance a thousand li in a day, and they are almost guaranteed to succeed in Foundation Establishment. However, after obtaining the Spiritual Resonance Qi, one cannot remain in this Spirit Domain. This is because if the Spirit Seed senses a cultivator possessing Spiritual Resonance Qi within the Spirit Domain, it will neither continue to unleash Spiritual Resonance Qi nor will it reveal itself.

Since very few people obtain Spiritual Resonance Qi, and their talent greatly improves after obtaining it, the sect naturally values them highly, taking them in as inner sect True Disciples and imparting more profound cultivation methods.

Chu Ning then asked a crucial question: "Senior Brother Zhuang, how many people might die each time this Spiritual Resonance Qi erupts, and how many are able to obtain it?"

Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Zhuang Yunde's bitter smile deepened. Instead of speaking aloud, he chose to transmit his voice: "Junior Brother truly hit upon the crucial point. Before this, the Spiritual Resonance Qi would erupt once every three to five years. Each time it erupts, no less than thirty percent and sometimes as much as sixty percent of the disciples would die. As for those who manage to obtain Spiritual Resonance Qi, they are fewer than ten. The most recent eruption was three months ago, and about forty percent of the disciples died. It seems four or five individuals obtained Spiritual Resonance Qi. I don't know the exact numbers."

Chu Ning fell silent upon hearing this, a chill involuntarily creeping into his heart. The sect's desire to obtain this Spirit Seed was clearly not a matter of a year or two. Considering what the sect had said earlier, that the number of service disciples had been increasing over the past fifty years, one could imagine how long this had been going on. Combining this with what Zhuang Yunde just said—a Spiritual Resonance Impact every three to five years, causing losses of at least 300 people and up to 500 or 600.

"The lives of these Qi Condensation disciples are truly worthless in the eyes of the sect's higher-ups," Chu Ning thought with a wry smile, though he naturally wouldn't voice this sentiment.

At this moment, Chu Ning even considered that the reason those so-called disciples who managed to leave the Spirit Domain were so highly valued by the sect was not only because their talent genuinely improved, but perhaps also for the purpose of keeping them under surveillance. After all, if these people were allowed to roam freely, there was no guarantee they wouldn't leak the secrets of this Spirit Domain. In fact, some of these secrets must have already been leaked. Otherwise, how else would disciples from the Yin Demon Sect have infiltrated?

As Chu Ning was thinking this, his gaze inadvertently swept over the distance, and a somewhat familiar figure entered his view. Luo Hongping, the one who had lived next door with Lu Yunfang back then. Lu Yunfang had already been killed by him, and now, Luo Hongping was here. Undoubtedly, people from the Yin Demon Sect had indeed managed to infiltrate.

Chu Ning's heart sank slightly. At this moment, he was still waiting for Tan Zhang to appear. If Tan Zhang could appear, then there would be no problem; Tan Zhang would surely find a way to inform others of this news. After all, as one of the disciples under Manager Liao Yunming in the Spirit Talisman Pavilion, Tan Zhang's connections within the sect were certainly greater than his own. If Tan Zhang didn't show up, he would have to find a way to relay this information himself. Chu Ning no longer cared about the sect's interests at this point, but his own life and the lives of those around him could not be constantly exposed to danger.

Zhuang Yunde, standing nearby, saw Chu Ning's silence and rather displeased expression. He thought Chu Ning was finding the news hard to accept, so he sighed slightly. Then, he reached out and patted Chu Ning's shoulder, saying, "Don't think too much about it. Since you're here, make the best of it. I think Junior Brother has good luck. Perhaps you and I can even obtain this Spiritual Resonance Qi."

Chu Ning smiled at Zhuang Yunde. "Senior Brother is right, we should always think positively."

Zhuang Yunde's round face also broke into a smile. "Exactly! You might have been forcibly conscripted by the sect, but I came here voluntarily. Although I wasn't clear about the specific situation, I was prepared to face the risks. This path, you could say, was chosen by me."

Chu Ning nodded. Indeed, Zhuang Yunde had mentioned that he had the option to refuse but still chose to participate. However, Zhuang Yunde, like himself, cultivated a wood-attribute technique. Even if he hadn't participated last time, he would certainly have been forcibly conscripted by the sect this time.

"Junior Brother Chu, since you've just arrived, the sect won't easily send you to activate the formation yet. They'll let you adjust to life here for a short period. Moreover, the Spiritual Resonance Qi just erupted three months ago, so it likely won't erupt again for a considerable time. You can cultivate here in peace. The spiritual energy is abundant, and there aren't many dangers. In terms of cultivation alone, this is a great place."

At this point, Zhuang Yunde chuckled again. "Furthermore, the senior brothers who arrived earlier have opened spiritual fields not far from here to sustain themselves. We can also grow some spiritual rice, so we won't starve. And some fellow disciples from the Spirit Beast Hall have brought spiritual chickens and pigs, raising them in pens further away. If you put aside the potential dangers of activating the formation, the cultivation environment here is even better than in the sect. Our Spirit Plant Hall members even have an advantage, as they can't refine pills or artifacts here."

Zhuang Yunde then shared some words with Chu Ning that took him by surprise. He had only noticed the thatched huts earlier and hadn't paid attention to these other details. However, upon reflection, it made sense. After all, everyone had been staying here for more than a day or two. And as Qi Condensation stage disciples, they couldn't abstain from grains, nor could they possibly carry enough Fasting Pills for extended periods. Chu Ning, on the other hand, had bought quite a few Fasting Pills from Gu Xiaoqing, which could sustain him for a good while.

The two chatted for a bit longer before Zhuang Yunde bid farewell and moved on to other areas. Chu Ning wondered if he was going to check on other people or perhaps greet more arriving disciples.

Once Zhuang Yunde left, Chu Ning continued to build his earthen-brick and thatched hut on his own. In less than half a day, Chu Ning had finished constructing the hut. Then, he began setting up his bed and other furnishings. Coincidentally, Chu Ning's new courtyard in the Outer Sect only had an empty bed and no other items. Later, he had specifically bought some room furnishings in the market and stored them in his storage bag, thinking of bringing them back to the sect someday. However, the sect's summons had been so sudden that, although Chu Ning returned to his courtyard for a few hours, he hadn't taken these items out. Now, they came in handy.

After some basic furnishing and arrangement, the thatched hut looked quite presentable. Sitting in his hut, Chu Ning began to sort through the information he had gathered and ponder his current situation.

His cultivation might be affected. Without the Azure Wood Spring Radiance Technique, although he had a good number of Spiritual Essence Pills and Fasting Pills, taking one daily would only last for a few months. If that wasn't enough, he would have to use spirit stones, but he didn't know how long he would have to stay in this Spirit Domain. As for spiritual herbs and fruits for body refinement, he currently only had about two hundred Golden Orchid Fruits from the latest harvest. For spirit refining techniques, he could only rely on talisman making to consume his spiritual sense and improve. However, there was probably no market for the talismans he created here. Everyone here was busy activating the formation in the Spirit Domain; talismans wouldn't be of much use. Moreover, he didn't know how the formation activation schedule would be arranged, or if his time would be guaranteed.

As for leaving, there seemed to be only two possibilities: either retrieve the Spirit Seed, or wait for a Spiritual Resonance Outburst and absorb a wisp of Spiritual Resonance Qi. Thinking of Zhuang Yunde's words about the Spiritual Resonance Outburst happening once every three to five years, and the last one occurring just three months ago, Chu Ning's brows furrowed slightly. Could he really be stuck here for three to five years? That was too long.

Leaving everything else aside, at his current cultivation speed, it wouldn't take him long to reach the ninth layer of Qi Condensation. And if he fully cultivated the ninth layer of Qi Condensation to reach the perfected stage before breakthrough, it shouldn't take more than a year. At that point, further cultivation methods would become a major problem; he couldn't just remain stagnant at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation.

At this moment, Chu Ning could only place his hope on one thing: the sect's sudden and unusual decision to organize so many wood-attribute cultivators to enter. Perhaps there was a larger operation underway that would prevent them from being stuck here for too long.

He replayed these thoughts in his mind, roughly sorting them out. Immediately afterward, Chu Ning stepped out of his hut and casually strolled around the newly built housing area, observing. In fact, many others were doing the same, everyone hoping to see if they recognized anyone.

During his stroll, Chu Ning indeed spotted several familiar faces, such as Mu Ling. Her hut was already built, and her assigned number was quite low, indicating she hadn't wasted any time on her journey and came straight here. Chu Ning also saw some relatively prominent faces he had encountered at the training grounds; several perfected Qi Condensation cultivators had all made an appearance.

After walking for a while, Chu Ning finally saw Tan Zhang and Lin Lan. Their hut numbers were in the seven hundreds, clearly meaning they had arrived earlier than Chu Ning. Since he knew Tan Zhang, Chu Ning proactively greeted him, then casually walked a bit further before heading directly back.

When Chu Ning returned to his hut, he saw Tan Zhang and Lin Lan also walking around, specifically towards the areas with higher numbers. Their constant looking around suggested they were searching for someone. Chu Ning naturally wouldn't reveal himself at that moment.

Two more days passed, marking exactly one month since Chu Ning and the others entered the Spirit Domain. That morning, Chu Ning got out of bed, and with a thought, he took out the guiding needle he carried. As expected, the needle no longer showed any display, just like before he entered the Spirit Domain. Clearly, what the elder had said earlier—that the guiding display would disappear if they didn't reach the Formation Site within a month—was not false.

As Chu Ning was pondering this, someone had already informed all newly arrived disciples in the Spirit Domain to gather.
