# Chapter 4: The Trading Fair  

The day of the Li family's trading fair arrived on the fifteenth of the month. The event was held in a spacious training ground carved into the mountainside of Mist Ridge.  

That day, Mist Ridge was flooded with unfamiliar cultivators. Most came from other cultivation families in the surrounding regions—such as the Wang family of Blackwater Pond and the Dong family of Golden Light Cove. Others were local or wandering rogue cultivators, mostly lone wolves drawn by the small-scale trading fair.  

For many cultivators, such fairs were not just opportunities to find coveted treasures but also valuable chances to broaden their horizons and expand their networks.  

To attend, Wei Qian rose before dawn, rushing to irrigate all the spirit fields in the terraces. Even so, he barely made it to the fair on time. By then, the training ground was already packed with two to three hundred people—all cultivators, without exception.  

"The mountain-protecting formation is also operating at full power," Wei Qian noted, sensing a peculiar shift in the surrounding spiritual energy. For a brief moment, it seemed as though the flow of qi had frozen.  

This, of course, was merely an illusion. Having read various miscellaneous texts about the cultivation world, Wei Qian recognized it as a common phenomenon when formations were activated at full strength.  

It made sense—with so many outsiders gathered on Mist Ridge today, even a single ill-intentioned individual could cause disastrous consequences.  

At the entrance to the training ground stood two Li family cultivators, verifying the identities of attendees. Their main task was to prevent wanted demonic or heretical cultivators from slipping in.  

A minor incident occurred when Wei Qian arrived. Having spent his time in the Li family shuttling between the fields and his residence, he rarely interacted with others, so the guards didn’t recognize him. They initially mistook him for a wandering rogue cultivator.  

Fortunately, the eldest daughter of the Li family, Li Caiwei, happened to pass by and vouched for him. The two then entered the fair together.  

The venue was bustling, with many cultivators already setting up stalls. Some wandered between them, stopping to haggle whenever something caught their eye.  

"Did you come here looking for something in particular?" Li Caiwei asked curiously.  

In the month and a half since Wei Qian had joined the Li family, he had barely left his residence except to work, embodying the very definition of a recluse. Naturally, she was intrigued by what had drawn him to the fair.  

"I just wanted to see what treasures might appear," Wei Qian replied.  

But then he added, "Though if there’s any high-quality spirit wine for sale, I wouldn’t mind buying a few jars."  

"Spirit wine?" Li Caiwei searched her memory before saying, "I recall a rogue cultivator who specializes in brewing spirit wine. Come with me."  

She led Wei Qian to the southeastern corner of the training ground, where a stall was laid out with rows of wine jars. One jar had been opened, releasing an intoxicatingly rich aroma that seemed to beckon passersby.  

"Smart move," Wei Qian mused. "This way, the wine doesn’t go unnoticed even in a crowded place."  

The fragrance had indeed drawn many potential buyers, but most left after hearing the price. Some tried to bargain, only to walk away frustrated when the seller refused to budge.  

Li Caiwei explained, "This is a well-known rogue cultivator in the area, skilled in mid-grade first-tier brewing techniques. His 'Clear Spirit Brew' is excellent, but his prices are steep—be prepared."  

Steep? Wei Qian’s enthusiasm waned. His total savings amounted to only ten spirit stones—eight from his previous earnings and two from the Li family’s monthly wages. Spending them recklessly would hurt.  

He wasn’t the only one hesitating. A tall, thin man was currently haggling with the burly stall owner.  

"Two spirit stones for one jar? What kind of spirit herbs did you even use to brew this?!" the man demanded in a shrill voice.  

The stall owner, a towering figure with a physique like an iron pagoda, scoffed. "If it’s too expensive, don’t buy it. I don’t force anyone to purchase my goods."  

The thin man stormed off in a huff, and many of the onlookers followed suit. Even Wei Qian hesitated—one jar cost a month’s wages. Was it worth it?  

Noticing his indecision, Li Caiwei whispered, "Are you short on spirit stones? If so, I can lend you some."  

Wei Qian shook his head. "It’s not that. I’m just considering whether it’s a fair trade—"  

Before he could finish, a grating voice interrupted.  

"Ah, the young mistress is here alone? I’ve been looking everywhere for you." The voice was smug and insincere. "Looking to buy spirit wine? You should’ve called me—I’d have been happy to pay."  

Li Caiwei frowned and snapped, "I don’t need your money, Wang Quan. Go bother someone else."  

At first, onlookers wondered who would dare flirt so brazenly with the Li family’s eldest daughter. But upon hearing the name, they understood—this was Wang Quan, the eldest son of the Wang family of Blackwater Pond.  

Wang Quan smirked. "No need to be so hostile, Li mei-mei. I was just—"  

Before he could finish, another voice cut in sharply.  

"Wang Quan, save your flattery. The young mistress is far beyond your reach!"  

Wang Quan’s face darkened. "Li Guchen, watch your tone!"  

"And what if I don’t?" Li Guchen retorted.  

Soon, more cultivators from both families joined the argument, and tensions escalated. Wei Qian frowned and subtly stepped back, letting others shield him.  

"The Li and Wang families seem to have quite the feud."  

Rivalry between cultivation families wasn’t uncommon, but this level of hostility suggested deep-seated enmity. Wei Qian worried things might turn violent—he wasn’t ready to give up his peaceful life just yet.  

The commotion drew even more rogue cultivators, eager for entertainment. Finally, three late-stage Qi Refining cultivators from the Li family arrived to restore order. Under their watchful gazes, the Wang family group, though still grumbling, had no choice but to retreat.  

After all, they were on Li family territory—starting trouble here would only end badly for them.  

The disturbance, however, had driven away all potential customers from the spirit wine stall, leaving the burly brewer scowling like thunder.  

Seizing the opportunity, Wei Qian finally stepped forward and approached the stall.
