# Chapter 13: Silk Armor

Han Yue had always been acutely aware that with his two great divine abilities—[Golden Light Flight] and [Thoughtless Slash]—his combat power far surpassed his actual cultivation level.  

When his divine energy was sufficient and the environment favorable, he could unleash devastating attacks capable of defeating enemies above his rank.  

However, due to his current cultivation limitations, Han Yue's reserves of divine energy were severely lacking, resulting in poor combat endurance.  

This had shaped Han Yue into developing a highly specialized fighting style—one that emphasized precision, efficiency, and the pursuit of a single decisive strike.  

Only by conserving his energy could Han Yue sustain himself in prolonged battles.  

Yet, despite his overwhelming offensive power and movement speed, Han Yue's physical defense remained relatively fragile.  

Thus, in combat, he avoided direct confrontation whenever possible, preferring ambush tactics.  

This fighting style gave Han Yue a significant advantage against demonic beasts.  

The Bronze Ram, a creature that would normally pose a serious challenge to an average first-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, had been effortlessly slain by Han Yue.  

After the ram collapsed, Fang Yi stored its corpse in a Corpse Storage Pouch and said,  

"Han Yue, since you took down this Bronze Ram alone, once we sell it to the merchant house, you should get at least 200 merchant coins as your share."  

"Once we're back, I'll have Xiao Liu hand you the money directly!"  

"It's been ages since the Ninth Courtyard managed to hunt two demonic beasts in one trip! Things are finally looking up for us!"  

This hunt had been extremely fruitful, and the entire team's morale was soaring.  

With renewed enthusiasm, they quickly made preparations and set off on their return journey.  

Along the way, Fang Yi's cart regrouped with those of the other three butchers, reforming the caravan.  

None of the other three had succeeded in their hunts.  

Cultivators like Han Yue and Fang Yi—whose combat prowess far exceeded their peers—were rare. Having two such powerhouses in a relatively weak faction like the Ninth Courtyard was already quite fortunate.  

The return trip was smooth, free of any complications, and soon the caravan arrived back at Butcher's Market.  

Once inside, Fang Yi removed his armor and immediately dragged Han Yue along, summoning Xiao Liu as they headed straight for the merchant house.  

Upon arrival, Fang Yi didn't wait for the other two and rushed ahead to the first-floor manager.  

After a brief exchange, Fang Yi pulled out the Corpse Storage Pouch and casually tossed it, causing the massive Bronze Ram carcass to materialize in the middle of the merchant house's first floor.  

**BOOM!**  

The mountain-like beast startled the surrounding visitors.  

Fang Yi paid no further attention to it, turning back to grab Han Yue and head up to the third floor.  

---  

"Han Yue, I've already negotiated with the manager—300 merchant coins for our ram. But if we spend it here on goods, they'll give us a value of 330 coins! What a bargain!"  

"Today, we're definitely getting you a proper set of armor!"  

Han Yue had no objections, though he kept one thought to himself—given his standards, 300 coins might not be enough for the kind of armor he had in mind.  

The third floor of the merchant house had a massive section dedicated to armor, filled with all kinds of plate armor, leather gear, shields, and more.  

Most were crafted from demonic beast materials, with a few metal pieces mixed in.  

The three of them slowly browsed through the displays. The majority were exaggeratedly bulky heavy armors, priced under 100 coins.  

The deeper they went, the higher the quality—and price—of the armor became, with increasingly refined craftsmanship.  

Han Yue called for a set of armor and examined its material and defensive properties.  

No good. This armor wouldn't withstand attacks powered by second-stage cultivation energy. For Han Yue, it was practically useless.  

He turned to the floor manager and asked,  

"Do you have any second-stage or higher armor? These won't do for us."  

The manager, surnamed Zhang, smiled and replied,  

"Of course we have higher-tier armor, though the prices are steeper. We don’t display them openly. Please, follow me."  

Manager Zhang led them to a private room and had several sets of armor brought out.  

"Recently, our merchant house hunted a second-stage [Earth-Splitting Lizard]. These armors are crafted from its dorsal plates—virtually indestructible!"  

"Each set is priced at 1,000 merchant coins. Please, take your time examining them."  

Han Yue tested the armor, channeling a trace of his thunderforce into it. The armor only deformed slightly—a clear sign of substantial defensive power.  

However, the style wasn't what he wanted.  

Heavy armor restricted movement too much, lacking the flexibility Han Yue needed for his combat style.  

"Manager Zhang, these are excellent, but I need something lighter and more form-fitting."  

After considering Han Yue's request, Manager Zhang had another item brought out—a square box containing a bundle of silver threads.  

"Your preferences don't quite align with the tastes of bloodline cultivators here in Guizhou."  

"In Butcher's Market, most cultivators prefer armor that's large and rigid—heavy plate is the norm."  

"However, I do have this set of silk armor, imported from the Inner Regions. It might suit your needs."  

"This type of armor is practically standard among Inner Region cultivators."  

"I've heard its crafting method originated from the fifth-rank sect, the Profound Mystery Sect—specifically, their 'Nascent Soul Inner Armor,' a protective divine ability exclusive to their third-stage grandmasters."  

"After many iterations, it evolved into this silk armor."  

"Made from the silk of a second-stage 'Spirit Spider,' it can expand to cover the entire body."  

"The silk is incredibly resilient and elastic, difficult to sever. Most importantly, it has excellent affinity with all types of energy, allowing it to be tempered by any cultivation method."  

"In the Inner Regions, many first-stage cultivators begin tempering their silk armor early on."  

"At first, its defensive power isn't remarkable, but once tempered to the second stage, many sects possess secret methods to convert the armor into a protective divine ability—its uses become far more extensive!"  

"However, Butcher's Market is dominated by bloodline cultivators, and we lack the secret techniques to refine silk armor into a divine ability, so this piece has remained unsold."  

"If it catches your eye, that would be ideal!"  

Han Yue took the silk armor and channeled his energy into it. The threads responded fluidly, as if breathing in sync with his power.  

In an instant, Han Yue understood how to use it.  

This was exactly what he needed—the perfect defensive artifact for him!
