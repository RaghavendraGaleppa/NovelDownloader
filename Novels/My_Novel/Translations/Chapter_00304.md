# Chapter 304: The Daoist Robe Beauty, Reunion with Old Acquaintances, Flower Thieves and Fierce Bandits, Not a Single One Left

The Western Regions were filled with countless Buddhist towers and temples, all believing in the cycle of reincarnation. The Northern Heavenly Domain possessed the Reincarnation Esoteric Sect, which tirelessly sought the location of the Underworld... Theories regarding the Underworld were endless, yet it remained difficult to draw a definitive conclusion.

When Zhang Zhisong wrote his book, he was merely over thirty years old. His firm belief that the Underworld existed was a matter worthy of deep investigation. Li Xian found the book fascinating. After leaving Huai'an County, he went to a riverbank to observe.

He wished to use the experience recorded in the book to read the river, understand the river, and manipulate the river... to observe the river's course and the various conditions within it. Li Xian had naturally high comprehension skills, and with the principles in the "Kan Nie Pulse Hand" transitioning from shallow to deep, he quickly grasped the first half of the principles.

This river was named "Ten Thousand Households River." It swelled in the seventh and eighth months and dried up in the third and fourth months. The river's pulse flowed south first, and after traveling seven to eight hundred miles, the river channel suddenly turned, changing direction to flow east. Along the way, three tributaries flowed into the interior, eventually vanishing.

There were also tributaries that flowed into underground rivers or merged with other river systems.

Li Xian relied on reading and understanding the river to observe the general situation. Seeing that it was still early, he walked along the river to verify the speculations in his heart. Although the information he read might not be entirely accurate or complete, it was indeed useful.

\[Proficiency: 1/100\]

\[Description: Read all rivers and streams, nothing is impossible.\]

Li Xian felt immense joy. He had gained something again, and his foundation was even richer. In the "Kan Nie Pulse Hand," although Zhang Zhisong set a grand wish to read all the rivers in the world and compile them into a "River Book," looking at the long history... he was not alone, nor was he the first to do so.

Since ancient times, there have been scholars wishing to compile a River Book. Moreover, compiling a "River Book" required a scholar blessed with fortune to succeed. This was because most river pulses were occupied by aristocratic families. The process of compiling the River Book required dealing with these families. Scholars possessed fortune but did not cultivate martial arts, making them safer to deal with the aristocratic families. They could persuade with words and communicate verbally, avoiding large-scale conflicts and fights.

Furthermore, this matter involved fortune... Although Li Xian admired Zhang Zhisong's character, he read a deep sense of helplessness, regret, and lament over a short lifespan from the "Kan Nie Pulse Hand," making it impossible to completely compile the River Book. Li Xian thought to himself that he was already a Second Realm martial artist, with a lifespan far exceeding that of mortals, yet he found it difficult to help Zhang Zhisong fulfill his wish.

Li Xian immersed himself in this Dao. He visited two river channels, observed the river pulses, and as his knowledge gradually grew, he felt a sense of "seeing mountains but not mountains, seeing water but not water," an ambiguous feeling of似是而非 (seeming right but actually wrong). The proficiency of the \[River Reading\] skill increased to \[2\].

Night gradually darkened.

Although he was delighted to gain a new skill, he could not neglect his main business. Li Xian hid the "Kan Nie Pulse Hand" under his clothes and returned to the side of the flower boat.

Tomorrow, they would set sail along the river to Flying Dragon City. Many laborers gathered around the flower boat, moving heavy boxes back and forth. Upon inquiry, Li Xian learned that Tang Feng had sold all the "Cold Heart Strange Fish" to the "Zhong Family" within Huai'an County.

The Zhong Family was a local aristocratic family with abundant wealth. They paid over four hundred taels to buy all the fish. Although this money was small, accumulating it drop by drop made a difference. Tang Feng then bought a large amount of porcelain, bowls, and other items from Huai'an County to transport and sell elsewhere.

In this way, he gained several layers of profit.

Tang Feng arranged the goods overnight. Li Xian learned from the side, absorbing experience. In the blink of an eye, it was the next day. The scattered Flower Cage Sect disciples reassembled. The number of people did not decrease but increased; it turned out that when the disciples scattered to move about, they反而 attracted some wandering disciples to gather.

Tang Feng shouted, "Set sail!" The sails fluttered, bulging like leather balls when the wind blew. The flower boat sailed along the river toward the southwest. Since the flower boat was disguised as a merchant ship, and they were indeed conducting business, this was natural.

The journey was safe and uneventful.

After traveling for about two days.

The flower boat turned into another river channel.

This river was named "Rolling Sand River." Li Xian observed that the river water was mixed with yellow sand and was very turbid. Combining the knowledge from the "Kan Nie Pulse Hand," he knew this river was deep and fierce, hiding many undercurrents and diverging channels. There must be many river bandits in the river.

Li Xian looked at the river scenery and thought: "Three hundred miles back, there was a tributary. If the flower boat had turned into that tributary, it could also head southwest, perhaps getting closer to Flying Dragon City faster. Moreover, the water flow in that river channel was fast but not urgent, very smooth. Why suffer this kind of turbulence?"

He had his judgment but did not speak up to remind them. The beauty of the "Kan Nie Pulse Hand" lay precisely here. Tang Feng had been navigating this waterway for decades and was quite familiar with the river conditions here. The route he chose was naturally correct. However, the river pulses were intertwined and complex, and there were always unexpected river paths. If one could master the "River Reading" skill, based on the river's conditions and pulse trends... it would be easier to find undiscovered shortcuts.

Amidst the rolling yellow sand, several black dots suddenly appeared in the river. Several small boats were seen heading this way. Sounds of laughter, scolding, shouting, and "thumping" drum beats came to the ear. It turned out to be fierce river bandits. Seeing the merchant ship, they approached to show their ferocity, intending to intercept it. Tang Feng cursed, "Damn it! Shoot at them!"

At the command, the Flower Cage Sect disciples held bows and arrows and shot at the river bandits. The bandits knew this ship was not easy to provoke and scattered and fled.

After traveling for about another day, the flower boat docked at a city port. This city was "Rich Wealth City." Tang Feng met a figure from the porcelain industry, intending to sell the porcelain in his hands.

This time, the situation was slightly unsatisfactory. That porcelain figure was very difficult to deal with and offered a low price. Although Tang Feng made some small profits, after this busy work, the effort was not worth the reward. After this incident, he was quite annoyed and stopped conducting business, increasing the ship's speed to rush to Flying Dragon City.

Soon, the waterway ended, and they arrived at a place called "Black Clip Mountain." Tang Feng dropped anchor for the flower boat and dispatched two people to guard the ship. The rest of the people all changed their clothes.

Tang Feng said, "Brother Hua, do you want to be the head of the household or the young master?"

Li Xian was confused and asked for the reason. It turned out... the remaining journey required walking on foot. Tang Feng had dozens of Flower Cage Sect disciples by his side. If they all rushed in together, wouldn't it attract attention? The Flower Cage Sect sneaking into Flying Dragon City originally intended to cause trouble and pick up loose ends.

Naturally, they needed to be low-key and cautious. Tang Feng decided to pretend to be a merchant caravan. A merchant caravan would have escort leaders, guards, coachmen, servants, heads of households... various types of people. If the team included captured beauties, they would add a few more identities, such as "daughter of a wealthy family" or "girl waiting to be married."

Moreover, this merchant caravan might not be entirely fake. Tang Feng's "wine," "honey," "dried flowers," "pollen," and many other goods were all taken along to Flying Dragon City to sell. It was indeed a merchant's action.

It could be said to be flawless.

Li Xian said, "With Brother Tang here, how dare I seize the lead? Please give me some swords and spears, and I will act as a guard." Tang Feng said, "Brother Hua, don't blame me for not reminding you. Although we are pretending, the business is real. You take on a role, you must do the work. Since you are a guard, you must walk on foot and take night shifts. Only then can we avoid showing flaws."

Tang Feng advised, "So... you might as well take the role of someone sitting in the carriage. Besides, with your looks and temperament, you don't look like a guard."

Li Xian thought: "That's better. I can hide myself even more. If we encounter danger, I won't attract the enemy's attention, and I can still deal with it calmly." He said, "No need. I'll be a guard. I will fulfill the duties of a guard. This is my foundational skill. Elder Tang doesn't need to worry that I can't do it well."

Seeing this, Tang Feng said no more, secretly feeling regret. He took on the role of the head of the household, changing into a brocade robe. Li Xian, on the other hand, held a long spear and wore a headscarf, trying to look ordinary and hide among the guards.

The disciples Kong Yu, He Wangfu, and Wei Ze all became guards. They loaded the goods onto the carriages, and a merchant caravan was formed.

The remaining journey had to be covered on foot. The speed was slightly slower. Although Li Xian served as a "guard," he had time at noon and evening to practice internal circulation to purify the body and advance his martial arts cultivation.

Flying Dragon City had a unique terrain and was relatively high. Huaiyin Prefecture was a rich water town, but as the season changed, the climate gradually cooled, and snow began to fall. However, it was not like the Poor Heaven Prefecture, where the snow was endless.

The journey was extremely smooth. In a few more days, they would reach Flying Dragon City. At noon that day, Tang Feng saw that the surrounding area was remote. Although the sky was still early, just past noon, if they continued traveling, they would inevitably have to sleep in the wilds and endure the wind and frost.

Therefore, when they saw an inn early on, he shouted, and all forty-plus people entered the shop. They would stay here for a night and set off early the next day.

This inn was named "Visiting Immortal Inn." Although it was located in the wilderness with a serene scenery, it was not a small inn. The inn actually contained landscape scenery and was spacious enough to accommodate forty people.

Tang Feng gestured for everyone to sit down. With a wave of his large hand, he ordered good wine and dishes to warm their bodies first, then ordered hard dishes like lamb, pork, and beef to fill their stomachs. The "Visiting Immortal Inn" was very spacious, with candles burning on all four sides, and the tables were heated with hot kang beds.

While waiting for the dishes, the people sat at separate tables, using the heat of the kang to warm their hands and feet. The waiter was nimble and quickly delivered jars of fine wine. After being heated by the fire, the aroma of the wine drifted, steaming hot. Everyone competed to drink a bowl first. The hot wine entered the stomach, and the comfort was indescribable.

Tang Feng instructed, "Brothers, I ordered some wine to warm your bodies, not to get you drunk. We must keep this in mind, don't be greedy for the cup. If anyone can't be woken up tomorrow morning, don't blame me for leaving you behind."

Li Xian thought: "Truly an old flower thief, experienced and flawless." He also took a sip of hot wine. Seeing the waiter bring the dishes, he asked, "Innkeeper, I see your inn is quite large. The decoration and scenery must have cost a lot of money, right? Can you earn back the money?"

Tang Feng listened intently and also felt suspicious.

The waiter said, "Guest, you asked the right person. This matter, we have to thank the City Lord of Flying Dragon City, Lord He. If it weren't for him, you all... might have to eat wind and welcome snow tonight. Where would you find such a fine inn to stay?"

"You are going to Flying Dragon City to do business, right?"

Tang Feng said, "Oh? You, a waiter, have quite sharp eyes." The waiter chuckled, "It seems you gentlemen have come from afar and are new to Flying Dragon City, so you don't know."

Everyone listened quietly. The waiter said, "Flying Dragon City has a unique terrain, sitting high on a plateau. Recently, the travelers and martial artists staying here are mostly heading to Flying Dragon City. I just guessed casually and happened to be right. What's so remarkable about that?"

The waiter said respectfully, "Just as this gentleman said. Our Visiting Immortal Inn invested a lot of money. This place is remote and has few people. On ordinary days, it's hard to see a traveler for several days. Naturally, it's not cost-effective, but what can we do... Lord He is not an ordinary person."

Tang Feng became curious and asked, "Please tell me in detail, how is Lord He not ordinary?"

The waiter said, "The old City Lord of Flying Dragon City, Lord He, is truly indescribable, famous for his benevolence and kindness. This master is generous, chivalrous, and extremely hospitable."

"He is charitable to the common people, helping ordinary folks build houses and settle down. To friends of the martial world, he is even more indescribable, enthusiastic and generous, like a spring breeze, with unparalleled righteousness."

"Just take our inn. How could ordinary people specifically build such a luxurious one here? Wouldn't it be a waste of money? But Lord He waved his hand, and along the road, he built dozens of them."

He Wangfu asked, "Dozens? Is he really someone with money to burn?"

The waiter said, "This is where his deep intention lies. Lord He said that Flying Dragon City is remote and the people are poor. Often, friends from the martial world visit him from afar because of his name. He felt that his hospitality was inadequate. Recalling the winding roads along the way, he only wished that those passing by Flying Dragon City would not have to sleep in the wilds and could also enjoy the scenery."

"So he spent money to build the inns fresh and elegant. So, gentlemen, coming from afar, being able to stay in such an inn, you really have to thank Lord He for his kindness."

Li Xian thought secretly: "If the rumors are true, this Lord He is indeed a very good person." He became very curious about Flying Dragon City and asked, "Waiter, are there any strange sights in Flying Dragon City?"

The waiter said, "There are plenty." He became enthusiastic and described the scenery in the city.

The most famous place was the "Worry-Free Tower." It was built with the full effort of Flying Dragon City. It was said that Lord He loved making friends and had friends all over the world. Occasionally, when both sides had grievances or conflicts of interest, and they were both friends of Lord He, they would go to the Worry-Free Tower together. Lord He would listen to their reasons and grievances and mediate between them.

Before entering Flying Dragon City, he already had some understanding. The waiter served tea and water, and soon the dishes were all served. Several large plates of meat were placed on the table, making people drool. In the lobby of the inn, the wind and snow howled outside, but inside it was warm and comfortable. Everyone drank and ate meat, lively and bustling.

They ate with great enthusiasm, and all kinds of vulgar jokes came out. The people were all disciples of the Flower Cage Sect. On ordinary days, they sought flowers, picked flowers, captured flowers, played with flowers, and teased flowers... Their minds were full of women, and the topics of conversation naturally revolved around the words "vulgar" and "common."

The inn's door was suddenly pushed open, and the wind and snow blew in. A woman's voice came from outside: "Master, there's an inn here. Come in quickly to warm up."

Then came a man's voice: "I thought we would have to sleep in the wilderness tonight. Our luck is good. Master, please be careful. There's a lot of snow here, and the road is slippery."

Li Xian heard this voice and felt it was slightly familiar. He was sure he had heard it somewhere before and turned his head to look outside. First, he saw a young woman in a green shirt walk into the inn. She patted the snow off her shoulders with her bare hands.

This woman had a pretty appearance, with an inlaid jade sword at her waist. The candlelight shone, and the sword was colorful and very extraordinary. Although she was in the cold winter, her clothing was light and elegant. Her upper body wore a green silk dress embroidered with gold threads and fish patterns. She had a sachet and a jade pendant at her waist. Her lower body wore a short skirt, and her white legs were fully visible. The wind and snow blew against her, making her look like a delicate jade artifact.

She wore fur boots on her feet. A few small snowflakes drifted to the top of the boots and fell into the shoes through the gaps. The woman frowned slightly, obviously noticing it, but she didn't show it. Instead, she put on a proud look on her face. The Flower Cage Sect disciples were all stunned, envying the snowflakes for their good fortune.

She was lively and charming, a feast for the eyes.

The Great Wu region was vast, and customs and habits varied. There were no restrictions on women's clothing; it was all determined by their temperament and personality.

The Flower Cage Sect disciples were all lechers. After days of bitter travel, they suddenly encountered such a beauty, and they all stared at her with naked eyes. The woman frowned and took a step back. Her master walked into the inn and happened to stand in front of her, glancing at the crowd with a warning look in his eyes.

This master was imposing, with his long hair tied up and wearing a sword-shaped hair crown. He looked very extraordinary and extremely arrogant.

Li Xian had already recognized the two of them. They were Wang Long and Ji Hui, whom he had met in "Embroidered City." In the past, when Li Xian fled from the One Union Manor, he passed through Embroidered City and encountered the Luo family's wanted criminal, the Black-faced Bat King. Li Xian learned the inside story from Wang Long and Ji Hui, and thus secretly lurked, successfully obtaining the human yellow essence treasure "Yellow Nine Ginseng."

The region was vast. He had thought that after parting ways, it would be difficult to meet again. Unexpectedly, in this icy world, in this wilderness inn, they met again. Li Xian was very curious and kept thinking:

"Flying Dragon City is located in Huaiyin Prefecture, while the two of them are from Quiet Spring Mountain, which is in Poor Heaven Prefecture. The two places are far apart. How did they also come here? I just heard the word 'Master'. Is their Master also here?"

Wang Long and Ji Hui stepped aside to the left and right. A woman dressed in a Daoist robe walked into the inn.

That beautiful woman held a horsetail whisk. Her face was fair, her lips red, her nose straight, and her eyebrows elegant. The Daoist robe was slightly loose, but it couldn't fully hide her figure. She was very tall, almost as tall as Wang Long.

She held the whisk and lowered her eyes to scan the crowd.

Because the inn door was open, the wind and snow blew into the room. The wind and snow actually circled around her once before blowing out of the room again. This detail was very difficult to notice because the wind is invisible, and snowflakes fall without any regularity. Moreover, the beautiful Daoist woman was standing right at the entrance. The wind and snow entering and exiting the room happened in an instant.

Li Xian had exceptional eyesight, so he could notice it. He muttered to himself: "This beautiful Daoist woman is very厉害 (powerful). Her martial arts have been integrated into her every move. I am now hiding in the Flower Cage Cave, and I am also a member of the flower thieves. If a conflict really arises, I will prioritize self-preservation." He secretly became on guard.

Wei Ze smiled and said, "Oh, on a snowy day, is the heavens bored with us just drinking and eating meat, sending two peerless beauties?"

Ji Hui frowned and cursed, "We are staying at the inn. What does it have to do with you? Why are you talking so much?" She looked around and saw the table full of wine and meat dishes, feeling very hungry. The hall was very spacious, and there were still many empty tables.

She pointed to an empty table and said, "Let's go sit over there." She was asking her Master, "Quiet Spring Taoist."

But the disciple Wei Ze, steeped in the Flower Cage Sect for a long time and deeply infected with bad habits, loved to tease women. Moreover, with Tang Feng and many fellow disciples here, his courage was even greater. He smiled and said, "How distant, truly distant. Good beauty, those tables and chairs are so cold. Why don't you sit in your big brother's lap instead?"

As soon as these words came out, the Flower Cage Sect disciples all sneered. All kinds of teasing and joking words came out: "Yes, young master's wine is already warmed. But... it was warmed with my mouth. Little heroine, come here quickly, I'll feed you."

"They say a thousand gold cannot buy a spring night. Today is a winter night. According to reason, it is three levels higher than a spring night, worth ten thousand gold and not for exchange. Meeting on this winter night, we are also husband and wife for a moment. First, call me 'husband' to hear."

The Flower Cage Sect had "Thirty-Six Techniques to Provoke Flowers." It was a side door method, recording words to anger women. When capturing women, first use words to disturb their emotions and disrupt their composure. This naturally increases the chance of success.

This move was invincible. Young women had shallow experience. Hearing so many words, how could they not be angry? Nan Gong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao had suffered from this. Ji Hui's face turned blue and white, and she trembled with anger. Suddenly, she drew her sword and slashed.

The disciple Wei Ze was the first to bear the brunt. The sword's锋芒 (sharp edge) pointed at him. He was over forty years old, but in terms of martial combat, if it was a one-on-one fight, he was truly not Ji Hui's opponent. He put on a smiling face and dodged to the side.

This sword hit the table and chairs. Ji Hui's wrist shook, and with a "crack," the table split into four pieces. Seeing that the first sword missed, she turned and executed a second sword move, her sword stance graceful. But because she was angry, she hid some ferocity and ruthlessness in it, making it even more tricky.

Instead, its power was not as strong as usual. Wei Ze's expression changed, and he was about to dodge. Suddenly, he felt a pain in his chest. The sword had not yet hit him, but it had already injured him. Wei Ze flew backward in shock and crashed into another table. His whole body broke out in bumps, his face turning blue and red.

It turned out... Ji Hui's second sword, although it looked tricky and seemed to want to stab someone, actually hid another secret. Her move looked like a sword strike, but she was actually using the sword body to play "Lingering Immortal Sound." The Lingering Immortal Sound started from the spine, the bones collided, and finally, the sound was transmitted to the sword body. This sword was three feet and six inches long, named "Blood Linglong." It contained three thousand six hundred and twenty-one small holes.

The Lingering Immortal Sound reached the sword body, causing the sword body to vibrate. The invisible sound came out of the holes in the sword, and then resonated with the opponent's chest cavity, causing trauma from the inside out.

This move was both real and virtual. It was a very clever use of the Lingering Immortal Sound. Only Li Xian and Tang Feng could see the principle.

Ji Hui raised her eyebrows, feeling very proud. Seizing the advantage, she did not let up. She flicked several wooden tables with her long sword and threw them at Wei Ze. Wei Ze raised his palms to defend, his palms striking the tables one after another, instantly shattering them. He rolled up and fought with Ji Hui.

After a few more moves, Wei Ze felt he was no match and was in imminent danger. Ji Hui said, "Taking advantage of your grandma, humph, eat your grandma's sword." She said it was one sword, but she executed four consecutive strikes.

She was enraged. Her sword strikes were decisive, hiding a killing intent. Wei Ze saw that it was difficult to fight back. Suddenly, seven people jumped out from the surroundings and joined the battle, shouting, "Brother Ze, we're here to help you!"

Ji Hui looked at the movements of the few people and knew their martial arts attainment was average. She sneered contemptuously, "Useless people like chickens and dogs, what use is it to have more!"

She swept her sword horizontally, using extremely strong internal energy. The seven people scattered and fled, dispersing to seven different positions. They vaguely formed a encirclement. Ji Hui was completely unaware that she had fallen into the formation of the "Lingering and Returning Formation."

This Lingering and Returning Formation was composed of "seven people." Ji Hui held her sword and acted arrogantly, wanting to fight again. Suddenly, she felt someone pull the back of her clothes, and she had already returned to the side of the Quiet Spring Taoist.

The Daoist-robed beauty, Quiet Spring Taoist, said, "Hui'er, do not be rude. Although they were disrespectful in their words, the martial world has all kinds of people. How can you expect everyone to be pleasing to you? You were ruthless in your attack just now. Is this how I usually teach you?"

Ji Hui quickly sheathed her sword and said, "Master, I was wrong. Disciple just..."

Quiet Spring Taoist said, "Go and apologize to him." Wang Long said, "Master, this..."

Ji Hui's eyes were red, but she still obeyed her Master's order and went over to bow and apologize. Quiet Spring Taoist said to Tang Feng, "We are just staying for a night and will leave tomorrow. We have caused much offense."

Tang Feng laughed and said, "No problem. Innkeeper, the wine and dishes for these three are on me."

Quiet Spring Taoist shook her head and said, "No need." She led Wang Long and Ji Hui to an empty table, ordered a vegetable soup and plain porridge, ate and drank casually, and then went to their rooms to rest.

Back in the bedroom, Ji Hui saw that Quiet Spring Taoist had a calm expression. She knew her Master had always been very disciplined and it was hard to see joy or anger on her face. So she apologized first.

Quiet Spring Taoist shook her head and said, "Hui'er, you did not do wrong." Wang Long said, "Ah, Master, then why did you..."

Quiet Spring Taoist said, "I did this just now to make them relax their guard. If I am not mistaken, this group of people... should be disciples of the Flower Cage Sect."

Ji Hui and Wang Long looked at each other, both startled. They asked in unison, "Master, what should we do?"

Quiet Spring Taoist's face was flawless. She opened her lips and said, "Such thieves are a scourge to the world. Naturally, we must find a way to eliminate them."

"Not a single one must be left!"
