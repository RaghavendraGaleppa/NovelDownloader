# Chapter 37: Talismans  

Lin Xuan had originally planned to return to the inn for a meal, but a stall along the way caught his attention, making him stop. He wasn’t the only one—the stall was surrounded by a crowd of people.  

What kind of treasure could attract so many cultivators? Driven by curiosity, Lin Xuan walked over.  

The stall owner was a simple-looking young man, around twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Flustered by the crowd, his face turned red as he stood behind a display of various talismans.  

Talismans were items created by cultivators who sealed spells into specially prepared paper. When used in battle, they required no spiritual energy and could be activated instantly, offering obvious advantages.  

For high-level cultivators, talismans were nothing special, but for low-level practitioners, they were valuable and practical tools. In combat, an extra talisman could sometimes tip the scales of victory.  

However, crafting talismans was a complex process. It required specific materials, consumed a great deal of spiritual energy, and had a low success rate. The more advanced the spell, the harder it was to create. Thus, talismans were considered rare and precious in the cultivation world.  

Lin Xuan had wandered the market for two hours without seeing a single talisman for sale, so he was surprised to find so many at this stall. A quick count revealed nearly a hundred.  

No wonder it had drawn such a crowd.  

Lin Xuan pushed his way to the front, but upon examining the talismans, his excitement quickly faded. He hadn’t expected to find high-level spells here, but he was disappointed to see that there weren’t even any mid-level spells available.  

All the talismans for sale contained the lowest-tier spells—basic techniques like Ice Bullet, Flame Burst, Quicksand, Falling Stones, and Thorn Barrier. While the variety was impressive, these were spells even a first-level Qi Condensation cultivator could cast effortlessly. What use were they?  

Despite the crowd, no one seemed willing to buy. After a long silence, someone finally spoke up in a mocking tone, "Hey, stall owner, how much for these talismans?"  

The young man’s face reddened further, and he lowered his head, looking utterly dejected. "Two talismans for one low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill," he mumbled.  

"Tch! These are the most basic spells—anyone can cast them. And you want that much? You must be desperate for pills."  

The crowd erupted in laughter and dispersed, leaving the young man even more embarrassed. With a sigh, he began packing up his stall. He had been here for two days without selling a single talisman.  

It wasn’t that low-level talismans were entirely useless—they could still serve as decent defensive options for weaker cultivators. The problem was twofold.  

First, Foundation Establishment cultivators wouldn’t buy them because they considered such spells beneath them and wouldn’t waste spirit stones or pills on them. Second, Qi Condensation cultivators, while capable of using them, were often too poor to afford them. Even if they wanted the convenience of talismans, they simply couldn’t spare the resources.  

In short, these low-level talismans were caught in an awkward position—too weak for the strong and too expensive for the weak.  

The honest-faced young man was actually a low-level disciple from the Dao Talisman Mountain sect. As the name suggested, its members specialized in crafting talismans.  

These talismans were his own creations, but due to his limited cultivation, he could only seal the most basic spells.  

He had hoped to sell them quickly by lowering the price, but crafting talismans was no easy task. The process required specific materials like talisman paper and demon beast blood, and the success rate was low.  

These hundred talismans had cost him nearly everything he had. Two talismans for one pill was already the bare minimum—he couldn’t go any lower.  

Yet, these low-level talismans were like "chicken ribs"—tasteless to abandon but unsatisfying to keep.  

The young man had arrived even earlier than Lin Xuan and had set up his stall for three days. While many cultivators had stopped to look, none had bought anything.  

Disheartened and with lunchtime approaching, he decided to call it quits.  

Throughout this, Lin Xuan had remained silent, but his mind was working. He wanted to buy these talismans. Though the spells were weak, sheer numbers could make up for it. If used all at once, even a Foundation Establishment expert would be overwhelmed.  

With a hundred low-level talismans, he could buy himself enough time to escape from a powerful foe.  

Of course, no one else in the cultivation world would be so extravagant. But with his purification ability, Lin Xuan had no shortage of pills. Fifty Marrow Cleansing Pills were nothing to him.  

However, he didn’t make the purchase immediately. Taking out fifty pills in public would draw too much attention—and Lin Xuan wasn’t foolish enough to invite trouble.  

If he was going to buy, he needed to do it discreetly.  

With this in mind, Lin Xuan blended into the dispersing crowd but didn’t go far. Instead, he lingered nearby, pretending to browse while keeping an eye on the talisman stall.  

Before long, the dejected young man packed up and left the square. Lin Xuan followed at a distance.  

Once they left the market, the number of cultivators around dwindled. Making sure no one was watching, Lin Xuan slipped behind a large tree and retrieved an item from his storage bracelet.  

It was a thin film with lifelike facial features painted on it—a disguise mask, commonly used by martial artists in the secular world.  

As the name suggested, wearing it would alter one’s appearance for anonymity. While the cultivation world had more advanced methods—certain techniques could change one’s face—Lin Xuan’s current cultivation level didn’t allow him to learn them. This mask, purchased during his journey to the Lingyun Sect, was the next best thing.  

This was his first time traveling far to attend a cultivator gathering, and he had come prepared. Now, his foresight was about to pay off—the disguise mask would soon prove its worth.
