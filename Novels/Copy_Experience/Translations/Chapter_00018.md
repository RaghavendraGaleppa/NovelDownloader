# Chapter 18: The Mo Family Son-in-Law

After returning home, Lu Xu pondered.

"The Mo family is recruiting sons-in-law. Even the worst spiritual roots are low-grade high-rank, and there are definitely many with mid-grade spiritual roots. Among so many people, not a single one has entered the late-stage Qi Condensation realm!"

"Old Xu has been in the market for over sixty years and is very knowledgeable. There's no reason for him to lie to me!"

"It seems being a Mo family son-in-law is indeed not a good path!"

"However, going to the Mo family this time might allow me to meet people I normally wouldn't. I need to make some preparations!"

Thinking this, he took out the spirit stones he had. Over these three years, the total number of spirit stones Lu Xu had accumulated reached seven hundred and eighty. Few would believe such a number if it were told. In reality, the spirit stones he earned over these three years were far more than this; he just used most of them to buy pills.

"Fortunately, only Tan Hu knows how many spirit stones I have, otherwise I would have been captured and controlled by the Mo family long ago!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

Taking out one hundred and eighty spirit stones, he decisively recharged them to the Bluestone Stele. With one hundred and eighty replication points, he calmly awaited the Mo family's gathering.

Three days later, Lu Xu and Han Er the simpleton arrived at the location of the Mo family's ancestral land. This was the core area of the market, where the Tier 2 spirit vein was located. Looking from afar, there were magnificent and imposing pavilions and palaces. Over two thousand Mo family members resided here. Of course, not all of them were cultivators; in fact, there were only four to five hundred true cultivators. The rest were mortals closely connected to these cultivators.

But the Mo family's population extended far beyond this. In the mortal town outside the market, there were tens of thousands of people named Mo. And in the mortal world, far from the cultivation world, the total population of the Mo clan across the various prefectures and counties of Wei State amounted to tens of millions. This was the foundation of a cultivation family that had been passed down for five hundred years! Any collateral descendants, no matter how many generations removed, who were born with cultivation aptitude would immediately be absorbed into the main branch.

Just as they arrived at the entrance, Lu Xu and his companion were led inside by a Mo family cultivator. After walking for a while, they arrived in front of a considerably spacious palace. Inside the hall, there were dozens of jade tables, each with a cushion behind it. Quite a few people had already arrived, all men, sitting neatly behind the jade tables. Lu Xu and Han Er the simpleton were also led to sit at two jade tables, one behind the other.

"Big Brother Lu, this meat seems to be demon beast meat, and the wine is spirit wine too!" Han Er's surprised voice came from beside Lu Xu's ear.

On the jade table were a wine pot, wine cups, a plate of meat, and a plate of fruit, all appearing to be spirit fruits.

"What extravagance!" Lu Xu sighed inwardly.

Han Er's mouth was practically watering, his eyes staring fixedly at the items on the table. He had never enjoyed such delicacies before and wished he could feast on them immediately. But seeing that no one else had started, he felt awkward moving first.

More and more people entered the hall, eventually almost fifty or sixty individuals were led to this place. All of them were young men! Lu Xu looked around, not seeing many familiar faces.

"There are quite a few people under thirty-five with low-grade high-rank spiritual roots or higher. I wonder how many mid-grade spiritual roots there are here!" Lu Xu muttered to himself. He was in the first row. Looking left and right, he saw only four or five people seated at the jade tables in this row. Thus, Lu Xu understood. These people should all possess mid-grade spiritual roots.

Not long after everyone was seated, a man with temples streaked with grey walked in with a majestic stride. This man was tall and imposing, with striking features, exuding an aura of natural authority that made one instantly recognize him as a superior. With a smile playing on his lips and deep-set eyes, he was indeed a charismatic middle-aged man. Behind him followed a tall woman in a black dress, with a cool temperament and features as beautiful as a painting.

"Big Brother Lu, this is..." Han Er the simpleton whispered.

Lu Xu nodded. This woman was precisely the one who had visited their courtyard before. On closer inspection, the woman did bear some resemblance to the middle-aged man.

"Everyone, I am Mo Changkong, the Mo family patriarch. The reason I invited you all to the Mo family this time is to allow the young women of our Mo family to witness the demeanor of the young talents from Green Lake Market—"

The Mo family patriarch stood in the center of the hall, speaking a great deal of flowery language. It was only then that some of the invited young men realized: so the Mo family was holding a matchmaking event? The crowd couldn't help but stir, and many began whispering among themselves.

"Big Brother Lu, is the Mo family going to introduce us to wives?" Han Er the simpleton asked, his eyes wide with disbelief.

"It should be. Isn't this what you hoped for?" Lu Xu smiled slightly.

Han Er's face immediately turned red, and he stammered, falling silent.

The Mo family patriarch watched everyone with a smile. Once the discussions quieted down, he announced loudly: "You should all know how our Mo family treats its own! A Tier 2 spirit vein, family subsidies—these are all basic. Various pills that enhance cultivation will also be sold cheaply within the Mo family."

The Mo family patriarch spoke at length about the benefits Mo family disciples could enjoy, making the eyes of the struggling rogue cultivators almost red with envy. Just the spirit stones alone: five spirit stones per month for low-grade high-rank spiritual roots as a subsidy, ten per month for mid-lower grade, and even more for higher grades, goes without saying.

"Big Brother Lu, sixty spirit stones a year! How many years would I have to farm to earn that?" Han Er asked, his eyes red.

"As long as you marry a Mo family woman, all of this will be yours!" the Mo family patriarch concluded. He then turned to the black-dressed woman beside him and said, "Qingchan, go call them all in!"

The black-dressed woman nodded, turned, and left the hall. A moment later, a fragrant breeze wafted in from outside the hall. A flurry of graceful figures, their fragrant skirts swaying, a full hundred Mo family women walked in. All of them were young maidens, each with a graceful figure, and both their looks and temperament were excellent. Whatever type you desired, you could find it here: plump figures with alluring, soul-captivating eyes; tall with long legs, cool and aloof, the 'imperial sister' type; clear eyes, pure and moving, like a first love type; dignified and elegant, with gentle smiles, the virtuous wife and loving mother type.

It made people's eyes dazzle. Lu Xu almost thought he was watching a beauty pageant.

"These are all mortal women carefully cultivated by our Mo family; they are educated, sensible, gentle, and virtuous. If you fancy any one of them, just say so!"

Many of those struggling rogue cultivators, who hadn't even visited the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion once, how could they withstand such a spectacle? Immediately, many people stared with wide eyes, their faces flushed, their hearts restless.

"May I ask, senior, there are more women than men here, can we choose more than one?" One voice spoke the thoughts of many male cultivators.

The Mo family patriarch looked at that person with approval and loudly declared: "Of course you can!"

"I've taken a fancy to nine, is that alright?" another person asked.

"Hahaha, no problem! A true hero takes nine wives!" The Mo family patriarch waved his hand grandly: "Pick as many as you like! But you better hurry, otherwise the good ones will all be snatched up by others!" he added, with a meaningful undertone.

As soon as these words were uttered, the restless cultivators could no longer hold back. They left their seats one after another and went forward to make their selections. Once chosen, the Mo family immediately sent people to lead them out. They would be married tonight, and from then on, they would be the Mo family's sons-in-law.

Yesterday, they were facing the yellow earth with their backs to the sky; today, they ascended to heaven overnight. Their lives were truly full of ups and downs.

Of course, many others remained unmoved. For example, Lu Xu, who was diligently enjoying the spirit fruits and spirit wine on the table.

The previously bustling hall quickly became sparse. Over a dozen jade tables were now empty, and forty to fifty Mo family women had also been taken away. The Mo family patriarch clapped his hands. Not long after, another group of women surprisingly walked in from outside the hall. There were over a dozen of them in total. Their appearance and temperament were in no way inferior to the previous group; in fact, they were even better. The Mo family was raising the stakes!
