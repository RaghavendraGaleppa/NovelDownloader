# Chapter 97: Surging Spiritual Essence  

On the third day of Zhang Jing's stay in the Fourth Void Heaven, a figure clad in purple robes entered the Myriad Treasures Repository.  

At first glance, the man appeared ordinary, even somewhat simple and honest. However, the oppressive aura radiating from him made it impossible for anyone to underestimate him. This was none other than You Yuanming, making his first visit to the Myriad Treasures Repository.  

After briefly scanning the two doors before him, You Yuanming strode confidently through the left entrance.  

"What would you like to exchange, honored guest?" Xiao You, the repository guardian, stood up and inquired softly.  

His attitude was markedly different from when he had interacted with Zhang Jing. The reason for this change was simple—Xiao You knew this man had come from the Eighth Void Heaven.  

Those capable of entering the Eighth Void Heaven were all terrifyingly talented individuals, almost certain to ascend to the Upper Realm. As a mere guardian spirit of the repository, Xiao You had no reason—nor the audacity—to provoke such a person.  

What if this man rose to prominence in the Upper Realm and later sought retribution?  

After some deliberation, You Yuanming selected thirty Spirit Awakening Bodhi Fruits and two qian of Enlightenment Tea before heading straight for the right door.  

Behind the door, Ying, another guardian, was frowning in frustration as he fiddled with a massive "transformation block" in front of him. Spotting the visitor, his expression shifted, and he hurriedly hid the block—ten times his size—behind his back.  

"What Dao Insight would you like to comprehend?" Ying asked.  

"How much spiritual essence is required to study the Immortal Treasure Origin Rune Imprint?" You Yuanming cut straight to the point.  

"One thousand spiritual essence grants three breaths of comprehension," Ying replied honestly.  

"Then I'll start with one hour," You Yuanming said calmly.  

His gaze then fell upon the enormous "transformation block," and a thought struck him.  

"Why is Junior Brother Zhang Jing's spiritual aura present here?"  

Curious, he opened the Spiritual Essence Ranking and scanned it from the bottom up. Soon, he found:  

**[Rank 610: Zhang Jing (Qi Refinement Tenth Layer · 34th Step · Longhu Dao Academy)]**  

At this sight, You Yuanming's eyes froze.  

"The Fourth Void Heaven? Already comprehending Dao Insight? So soon?"  

For a moment, he recalled his earlier promise to Zhang Jing, his brow furrowing involuntarily. This development didn't align with his cultivation plans.  

But then, as if struck by a realization, his expression relaxed.  

"Never mind. As long as I gain insights from studying the Immortal Treasure Origin Rune Imprint and successfully transform my Dao Foundation into a Golden Dao Foundation, I can use guidance in Foundation Establishment as leverage. Junior Brother Zhang Jing will naturally understand which path to choose."  

---  

You Yuanming's gaze deepened.  

If Zhang Jing chose the path of formation runes, then in 183 years, he would likely become his junior in the Upper Realm. With this shared bond, Zhang Jing would be his most trusted ally.  

In the pursuit of the Dao, four elements were essential: wealth, companionship, methods, and environment. Among them, "companionship" included alliances with fellow cultivators and relationships within one's sect.  

From what You Yuanming knew, this was especially crucial in the Upper Realm, where mighty figures abounded.  

---  

Twenty days passed in a blur.  

In a lightless abyss at the deepest part of the ocean, jagged rocks loomed in utter silence. The crushing, omnipresent pressure made it a place no ordinary cultivator would dare venture.  

Yet today, the stillness was shattered.  

Zhang Jing's figure darted forward, his body faintly emitting a dark spiritual glow. The Five Treasures Spiritual River coiled around him like a protective serpent.  

Ahead of him fled a panicked group of sea-dwelling spirit beasts—each as large as an elephant, their bodies streamlined like arrows, with four small claws beneath their bellies and long, serpentine tails.  

Gradually, the creatures began to slow.  

But Zhang Jing moved with undiminished speed, as though the oppressive pressure of the depths had no effect on him.  

*Exhilarating!*  

To him, this boundless abyss felt like home.  

Thanks to his **[Body of the Flood Dragon]**, the vast ocean had become his absolute domain. The perfected **Dark Flood Dragon Devours the Void Dao Rhyme** further enhanced his movements, making him as agile as a fish in water.  

As he closed in on the spirit beasts, he willed his spiritual river into action.  

*Whoosh—*  

The Five Treasures Spiritual River erupted, its icy aura forming a massive pillar of ice in the lightless depths—spanning several zhang in width and stretching dozens of zhang in length, its surface shimmering faintly.  

Under the full amplification of his Dao Rhyme, the ferocious aura of a flood dragon rapidly spread outward.  

The fleeing spirit beasts froze in place before being engulfed by the spiritual river.  

*Spiritual Essence +500!*  
*Spiritual Essence +500!*  

Before long, the beasts' corpses vanished without a trace, and the abyss returned to silence as though nothing had happened.  

Standing atop a boulder on the seabed, Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed with excitement.  

Thanks to that group of spirit beasts, his gains today far exceeded his usual harvests.  

Each beast yielded 500 spiritual essence, and the group had numbered well over twenty.  

---  

Connecting with the Dao Mark in his palm, he checked his reserves:  

**[Spiritual Essence: 315,810]**  

A smile tugged at the corners of his lips.  

Compared to his experiences in the Third Void Heaven, the Fourth Void Heaven seemed almost too generous.  

"Ten more days until my Dao-Guiding Light fully recovers. I'll aim to accumulate 500,000 spiritual essence by then and use it to elevate my **Dark Flood Dragon Devours the Void Dao Rhyme** into a Dao Insight!"  

His expression hardened with resolve.  

The Fourth Void Heaven was an ideal place for him to gather spiritual essence and provided the perfect conditions for comprehending the **Lunar Flood Dragon Dao Insight**.  

This opportunity—he would not let it go to waste.  

---  

Meanwhile, not far from Zhang Jing, four figures worked together to hunt three octopus-like spirit beasts.  

They operated in the middle layers of the ocean, unlike Zhang Jing, who ventured straight into the abyss.  

The reason?  

The depths were far too perilous for them.  

Down there, spirit beasts roamed in hordes—groups of dozens, even hundreds—far beyond what these four could handle.  

The crushing pressure of the abyss was another deterrent.  

As time passed, the leader of the group spoke while observing the nearly defeated beasts:  

"Alright, according to our agreement, it's your turn now."  

The other three immediately unleashed surges of powerful spell fluctuations.  

Watching his spiritual essence rapidly increase, the portly cultivator among them grinned.  

"Ah, when I think about it, we really ought to thank Junior Brother Zhang Jing. If not for him, the four of us wouldn't have teamed up to hunt these beasts."  

"On average, each of us earns 3,000 spiritual essence daily. If we can keep this up, in just four or five months, we'll all have enough to try using Enlightenment Tea to comprehend Dao Insights."  

"Perhaps we really can—" His face lit up with longing.  

"Brothers," the lone woman in the group interjected, "why don't we invite Brother Song Ci to join us tomorrow? He seems to be struggling lately."  

The leader pondered briefly before shaking his head.  

"Better not. If we bring him, what if he insists on bringing Junior Brother Zhang Jing along too?"  

"Don't forget—Junior Brother Zhang Jing is already on the 34th Step!"  

"His talent is monstrous to begin with. If he also gets the same resources as us..."  

At these words, the other three fell silent.
