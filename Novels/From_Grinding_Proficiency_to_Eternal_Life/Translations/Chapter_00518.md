# Chapter 518: The Three Calamities of Heavenly Man's Five Declines

Xu Yunfan instantly understood. The Primordial Clear and Turbid Qi he had painstakingly collected was never meant for the True Lord of the Clear Source; in the end, it was all for Chu Chengnan. That True Lord of the Clear Source was indeed a fine leader.

Damn it, the minds of these people are all darker than the last. They twist and turn with their thoughts, their intentions impossible to guess until the very last moment.

But Xu Yunfan wasn't angry. He also wanted to see what obtaining the Golden Core and proving the Dao was like within the Taihua Spirit Ruins World. With Chu Chengnan as a shining example before him, he could observe and learn. When he later broke through to the Golden Core and achieved the position of a True Lord, he would naturally be able to avoid many detours.

"Please, Junior Brother Xu, guard the law for me!"

Chu Chengnan wasted no more words, his figure soaring into the air and hovering directly above the surging torrent of Turbid Evil Qi erupting from the cliff.

"Positioning Heaven and Earth, the Earth Veins heed my command! Rise!"

With his thunderous shout, it was as if a Mountain God had issued a decree. An indescribably vast will erupted from him. A majestic, mountain-like mana spread out from his body.

Chu Chengnan cultivated the *Hundred Mountains Demon-Suppressing Sutra*, condensing the foundation of a thousand mountains and ten thousand peaks. His aura was intertwined with the earth, becoming one with it.

*BOOM!*

The entire Cold Crow Pass—no, the entire land within a thousand miles centered on Cold Crow Pass—began to rumble and shake, as if a subterranean dragon were turning over. The earth's crust trembled, and invisible meridians were forcibly awakened.

The cultivators within Cold Crow Pass were all shaken. A Foundation Establishment elder, sensing the surge in the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms, immediately paled.

"A Great True Lord is seeking the Golden Core to prove the Dao!"

Hearing this, the surrounding cultivators also changed their expressions. An old cultivator couldn't help but mutter, "How many years has it been since someone sought the Golden Core and proved the Dao within the Taihua Spirit Ruins World?"

As he spoke, an indescribable aura began to rise between heaven and earth.

At this moment, visible streams of earth-yellow light, like giant serpents awakening, roared as they converged from all directions—from the depths of the earth, from the thousands of mountains and hills.

These were not actual mountains moving, but rather, under the催动 of Chu Chengnan's *Hundred Mountains Demon-Suppressing Sutra* mana, the essence of earth qi that had been deposited for ten thousand years within the mountain veins, possessing the attributes of "immovability" and "heaviness," being forcibly stripped away, extracted, and relocated.

At this moment, it was as if ten thousand earth-vein dragon souls were being forcibly captured and summoned. They transformed into thick, solid columns of Profound Yellow Qi, rising from the ground and crossing the sky, all heading straight for Chu Chengnan.

*SWISH! SWISH! SWISH! SWISH!*

One by one, massive columns of Profound Yellow Qi descended from the horizon, plunging violently into the mighty torrent of Turbid Evil Qi erupting from the cliff at Cold Crow Pass. Nourished and guided by the countless earth-vein essences, the Turbid Evil Qi instantly became even more violent and purer.

Seeing this, Chu Chengnan continuously打出 hundreds of hand seals to牵引 the Turbid Evil Qi. The Primordial Clear and Turbid Qi,伴随 by the Turbid Evil Qi, no longer erupted chaotically but instead环绕 around Chu Chengnan, forming a pillar of Profound Yellow and Turbid Evil Qi that connected heaven and earth.

The power of the earth veins, heavy enough to crush all things, perfectly fused with the destructive Turbid Evil Qi.

Chu Chengnan looked on with a hint of joy in his eyes. The ritual was already complete, and he hadn't expected it to be so easy. Yet, he was also deeply moved.

"Five lifetimes of cultivation, and in this life, I have finally achieved perfection. May the Dao endure, and may the position of the Golden Core bestow its favor."

He took a step forward, entering the pillar of Profound Yellow and Turbid Evil Qi. Standing at the core of this sky-piercing pillar, Chu Chengnan was like a son of the earth, a master of mountains and rivers.

He formed seals with his hands, chanting ancient and profound scriptures. Each syllable caused the massive Turbid Evil Qi pillar beneath his feet to resonate violently. His entire figure was shrouded in intense Profound Yellow light, his form becoming indistinct, as if he had merged with the pillar that pierced through heaven and earth.

Subsequently, his mighty mana and the earth's spiritual mechanisms感应,接引 the ritual, communicating in the冥冥 with the source of the "Immovable Mysterious Mountain" Golden Core.

The scene at Cold Crow Pass was terrifying to the extreme. On one side was the violently erupting pillar of Primordial Clear and Turbid Qi, as if it wanted to tear the heavens apart. On the other side were countless streams of Profound Yellow earth-vein洪流 converging from all directions. Together, they guarded the core pillar, which grew brighter and heavier, as if it were nurturing an ancient mountain.

The entire heaven and earth were搅动 by this terrifying earth-vein energy and evil qi storm. The clouds for ten thousand miles were排空, revealing the deep, ink-black night sky behind. Above the night sky, an indescribable aura began to diffuse.

A heavenly and earthly attribute representing "solidity," "immovability," and "bearing" was slowly condensing and manifesting. This was a sign that the Golden Core was about to descend and bestow its favor.

Below, Xu Yunfan watched intently, his expression grave, his spiritual sense already悄然 spreading out for a hundred miles. Such a grand spectacle, which almost stirred the entire heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms to a boil, had inevitably drawn the attention of the entire world.

A Great True Lord at the peak of Foundation Establishment seeking the Golden Core, seizing the source of the heavenly and earthly Golden Core to form his own, was an act of defying heaven and changing one's fate. Heaven and earth would surely send down calamities, known as the "Three Calamities of Heavenly Man's Five Declines."

This act was essentially like a giant rat in this world, digging out the root qi of heaven and earth to achieve its own Golden Core. The Heavenly Dao would naturally resist, forming these calamities.

The first calamity is the phenomenon of the Five Declines invading the heart and body. The second calamity is the排斥 of the heavenly and earthly laws, bringing down the calamities of thunder, wind, and fire. The most dangerous and unpredictable one, however, is the "Human Calamity."

The Heavenly Man's Five Declines calamity arises from the deepest part of the cultivator's body and soul. It is the most mysterious and insidious. Most cultivators fall here, their Dao dissolving into heaven and earth.

However, Chu Chengnan's cultivation of the *Hundred Mountains Demon-Suppressing Sutra* had long since reached perfection. His foundation of a thousand mountains and ten thousand peaks was as stable as磐石, and his will was as unshakable as a mysterious mountain.

Xu Yunfan could see clearly that in the face of a fully prepared Chu Chengnan, the heavenly and earthly calamities were truly insufficient. The decaying qi that could cause a Foundation Establishment True Lord's lifespan to dry up and his body to rot, no sooner had it appeared than it was crushed and pacified by his majestic, mountain-like heavy mana and will. The light of Profound Yellow around him only rippled slightly before returning to stability, and the Five Declines calamity was silently broken.

Following closely was the heavenly and earthly calamity. It should have been heavenly thunder, earthly Yin fire, wind blades and frost swords all arriving together to destroy the one who defied the Dao. However, this place was Cold Crow Pass, a place of ultimate Yin and filth where Primordial Clear and Turbid Qi erupted.

The earth-vein Turbid Qi洪流 that Chu Chengnan had summoned was fused with the will of a thousand mountains and ten thousand peaks, carrying infinite earthly evil. No sooner had the heavenly thunder condensed in the nine heavens, its majestic might not yet descended, than the Profound Yellow pillar, which had condensed the essences of ten thousand miles of earth veins and heavy Turbid Evil Qi, shook violently.

In an instant, Chu Chengnan forcefully wielded the earth's脉络 to对抗 the heavenly punishment. The top of the pillar erupted with heavy Turbid Qi that could crush the heavens, shooting straight into the clouds and violently搅动 and dispersing the thunderclouds that had just gathered.

*BOOM!*

Such an act naturally enraged the Heavenly Dao. But now, Chu Chengnan's aura was intertwined with the earth's veins. The spiritual mechanisms of the land within tens of thousands of miles centered on Cold Crow Pass were all forcibly bound to him. If the Heavenly Dao insisted on sending down an immense killing calamity, this entire region would likely cease to exist. It was completely a case of hitting oneself.

Xu Yunfan suddenly understood. He hadn't expected there to be such a trick.
