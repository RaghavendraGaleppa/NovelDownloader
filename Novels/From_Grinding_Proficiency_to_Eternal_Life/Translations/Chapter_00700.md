# Chapter 700: Wukong, You’ll Have to Spend a Bit More of Your Life

The skeletal meridians were laid with the foundation of Gengjin Mother Qi, the flesh was shaped with warm jade marrow, the nodes of the meridians were transformed from lightning-struck wood cores, and the core of the organs was constructed from earth-fire melted heart jade...

Fine, wispy strands of pure vitality and origin imprints, transformed from Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, were infused into it.

This was the clone technique recorded in the *Mysterious Capital Eight Scenery Forging Heaven Creation Scripture*.

The Cloud Scripture Clone Technique.

Originally conceived by its creator to assist in artifact refining, it unexpectedly developed into a top-tier miraculous art.

This technique was profoundly extraordinary, neither illusory nor a mere shadow. It was a true recreation of an independent self, containing the origin imprint of the main body.

Its bone structure, comprehension, and potential were all reflections and extensions of the main body.

Every time he cultivated the Cloud Scripture Clone Technique, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but secretly marvel.

This miraculous art truly participated in creation; he wondered how its creator had ever conceived of it.

According to the records, the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi was originally created by the Primordial Dao Lord. This Cloud Scripture Clone Technique was merely intended to provide two extra clones during artifact refining for greater precision.

However, this method manipulated creation, using the self as a foundation to sever a clone, was truly extraordinary.

If it were to be leaked, even the Bodhisattva Pure Land and the Myriad Chariot Sword Sect would not let it go.

Now, with the support of the Attribute Panel's rule-transcending characteristics, the entire refining process was pushed to the absolute pinnacle of perfection. The fusion and transformation of the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi were seamless and flawless, without the slightest obstruction or risk of backlash.

Or rather, with the existence of the Attribute Panel, the proficiency Xu Yunfan had attained at the level of perfection was, in truth, even greater than that of the technique's original creator.

Time flowed silently amidst his focused refinement.

After an unknown amount of time, the roiling eight-colored cloud qi within the great hall suddenly retracted inward, pouring entirely into the Dharma Body that had already taken form and was seated cross-legged amidst the swirling clouds.

It was once again a monkey Dharma Body.

Its physical outline was identical to Wukong's original body. Its entire form was covered in fine, lustrous golden fur. Under the illumination of the purple and gold lightning patterns flowing through the Palace of Divine Xiao, it presented a texture like molten gold. Though it was a newly forged body, it faintly exuded an extraordinary and transcendent aura.

The Dharma Body's face was clear, with a sharp mouth and monkey-like cheeks—Wukong's iconic appearance.

Its eyes initially carried the purity and emptiness of a newborn, but deep within, two faint dark golden lights quietly ignited, like two pieces of deep-buried residual charcoal being kindled. Though not dazzling, they carried an unyielding, stubborn fire.

At this moment, it sat cross-legged. The residual eight-colored cloud qi around its body had not yet fully dissipated, curling around it like wisps of green smoke, adding a touch of mystery.

Though its posture was still, the peerless battle intent within its bones—the kind that could prop up the heavens and battle the world—seemed to be imprinted in every single golden hair, lying dormant amidst the silence with an untamable nature.

Xu Yunfan looked on, secretly praising his own artifact-refining skills as truly divinely crafted.

The body he had forged was absolutely perfect for Wukong's true spirit.

The Dharma Body slowly opened its eyes. They initially carried a hint of newborn purity and emptiness, lacking some of the depth and vicissitudes of Xu Yunfan's main body.

Only through the unbreakable control link of the Attribute Panel could Xu Yunfan clearly perceive that a brand-new and independent personality consciousness was rapidly gestating and taking shape within this clone.

"Fellow Daoist."

After a long while, the clone gave a slight nod to Xu Yunfan's main body, its voice calm and even.

Xu Yunfan's main body also nodded in response.

"Thank you for your trouble, Fellow Daoist."

After the Cloud Scripture Clone Technique was perfected, the main body's consciousness could transfer without hindrance between the main body and the clone. The power, insights, and realm carried by the main body were also possessed by the clone as a foundation.

However, the effect was slightly inferior. A Cloud Scripture Clone refined at the Golden Core Realm was still far superior to an ordinary Foundation Establishment perfection cultivator.

However, Xu Yunfan did not need the true spirit formed within this clone's body.

Now that the new clone was complete, his mind moved again. He raised a hand and gently tapped the Zhoutian Star Spirit Banner floating beside him.

The banner's surface flowed with dark light, and the constellations of the Zhoutian flickered on and off.

A faint yet exceptionally tenacious shadow, carrying a texture like molten gold and an aura of soaring arrogance, was slowly drawn out. It was the last wisp of unyielding true spirit that remained within the Star Spirit Banner after the clone Wukong had self-detonated his Golden Core.

The dark golden shadow was supported by the banner's power, hovering in the center of the great hall.

The shadow slowly condensed, revealing Wukong's iconic monkey silhouette, though it was illusory and ethereal, its aura extremely weak.

Wukong first looked around in a daze. When those golden eyes, formed from pure will, saw Xu Yunfan's main body seated high on the cloud platform, his confusion was instantly replaced by a torrent of fury.

"Xu, Yun, Fan!"

A soundless roar exploded on the spiritual level, filled with hatred and brutality.

Driven by his residual fighting instincts, Wukong's true spirit subconsciously made the motion of holding a staff and striking down. The illusory shadow of the Sea-Propping Purple Gold Staff, carrying a resolve to shatter both jade and stone, fiercely smashed down towards Xu Yunfan.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan's expression remained light and calm, without the slightest bit of concern.

The staff shadow had not yet fully solidified.

*Hum!*

An invisible, formless, yet absolutely controlling force that surpassed the comprehension of this world erupted from the very core of Wukong's true spirit—the origin imprint.

The Attribute Panel's强制 control imprint ignored all will to resist, instantly freezing all of Wukong's true spirit's movements and intent to attack.

The condensed staff shadow, like a punctured bubble, dissipated soundlessly.

Wukong's true spirit trembled violently, its illusory face twisting. Within the burning fury in its golden eyes, there was a mix of helplessness and frustration that cut to the bone.

Xu Yunfan's main body had an indifferent expression, his gaze calm as he looked down at the struggling Wukong true spirit, his eyes carrying a sense of looking down from above.

He spoke slowly, without joy or sorrow.

"Wukong, the past is done. You are now my clone. Though you have endured calamities, as long as your true spirit is not extinguished, it is not a dead end.

Now, you are but a true spirit, trapped within the Star Banner. This is not a long-term solution.

Rage is useless. Accept reality, and you can find a chance for a new life."

The powerful spiritual suppression and the reality of the situation gradually calmed Wukong's true spirit's struggles, but the arrogance and hatred in his golden eyes did not vanish. They were merely forcibly suppressed, like magma frozen by ice.

Xu Yunfan naturally did not mind this. After all, Wukong was essentially a Heart Monkey, a violent creature by nature.

Though he was a先天 creature, he had also inherited Xu Yunfan's negative emotions.

Xu Yunfan continued, "Fellow Daoist, how about you take a trip to the Underworld for me?"

Wukong stared intently at Xu Yunfan and questioned him.

"A new life? My true spirit has not scattered, but my physical body is destroyed, and my Golden Core Dao Fruit has turned to ash!

What new life? This so-called Underworld Sea of Bitterness is the final destination for the dead!

I am not completely dead, nor am I a mindless spirit. How can I enter?! You want to use me as a spear again, to闯 that place of certain death?!"

Xu Yunfan had long anticipated Wukong's resistance, and he responded with a smile.

"Who said that to enter the cycle of the Underworld, one must have their body destroyed and their spirit scattered and mindless? You were born from a先天 stone embryo, with a unique endowment. Even with only your true spirit remaining, you are not comparable to an ordinary soul.

As for the method of entry..."

He paused, his gaze turning to the Cloud Scripture Clone he had just refined.

"I will naturally refine a protective artifact for you."
