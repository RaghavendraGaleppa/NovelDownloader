**Chapter 50: Heaven's Chosen Daughter**

In the Blood Robe Pavilion of Skeleton Mountain Market City.

Lü Yang had just withdrawn his consciousness from the Myriad Spirits Banner when he suddenly felt his vision go dark, his spiritual platform clouded. He frowned slightly and looked towards the distant sky.

The next second, he had already activated his escape light and arrived at the edge of the market city.

A brilliant light shot from the horizon, flying like fire chasing lightning. It only converged as it reached the market city's entrance, revealing a tall, heroic woman.

"...So it's a fellow Daoist from Sword Pavilion."

Lü Yang had also cultivated the "Divine Firmament Sword Command True Art" and recognized the newcomer's origin at a glance. He immediately cupped his hands and bowed, saying, "I am Lü Yang. May I ask for fellow Daoist's name?"

"Jade Pivot Yun Miaozhen."

As these words left her lips, Lü Yang's eyes instantly narrowed. After all, Yun Miaozhen and Yun Miaoqing were two names so similar that it was too easy to make a connection.

"Is fellow Daoist here to take your sect sister back?"

Thinking this, Lü Yang didn't hesitate in the slightest. With a casual wave of his hand, he directly grabbed Yun Miaoqing from within the Blood Robe Pavilion and threw her in front of Yun Miaozhen.

"Miss Miaoqing has not suffered any grievances in the Sacred Sect. Although she is nominally my servant, I have never humiliated her over the years, so she remains a virgin. If fellow Daoist wishes to take her back, please do so at your convenience. My cultivation is shallow, so I won't see you off outside the formation."

In Lü Yang's view, he had no enmity with Sword Pavilion.

After all, he had not only preserved Yun Miaoqing's life but also her purity. As the leader of the righteous path, Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion surely wouldn't make things difficult for him.

However, he soon realized he was wrong.

"Miaozhen... is still a virgin?"

Yun Miaozhen's beautiful eyes were lowered, her gaze fixed on Yun Miaoqing. Yet, there was not a trace of joy, but rather a hint of disdain and helplessness.

The next second, she let out a long sigh: "What a pity! Miaoqing, you won't be able to overcome this tribulation!"

As her words fell, not just Lü Yang, but even Yun Miaoqing was stunned, her face full of disbelief: "Sister... what do you mean by that?"

"You haven't received the true inheritance, so you don't understand."

Yun Miaozhen shook her head, "You have shallow blessings, and your destiny by birth is insufficient, yet you forcefully sought immortal destiny. Originally, you were meant to face three disasters and nine tribulations; failing to overcome even one would lead to the disappearance of your Dao and your death. That's why I specially asked my master to combine your three disasters and nine tribulations into a single ten-year grand tribulation."

"This ten-year grand tribulation was your decade of being trapped in the Demonic Sect."

"During these ten years, if you suffered endless humiliation, with 'one red lip tasted by ten thousand people,' yet still maintained a firm Dao heart and unwavering resolve, then this tribulation would be considered passed."

"What a pity... you are still a virgin!"

"Being a virgin, having suffered no humiliation, means the tribulation will naturally not be reduced in the slightest, and may even be aggravated!"

At this point, Yun Miaozhen looked at Lü Yang, her eyes revealing killing intent: "This demonic scoundrel ruined your cultivation. He seems benevolent, but in reality, he harbors ill intentions. He deserves to be slain!"

"..."

Lü Yang had to admit, he was dumbfounded.

Yun Miaoqing was even more utterly unable to accept it, her lips trembling: "So, the reason I fell into the hands of the Demonic Sect ten years ago and became a slave..."

"Naturally, it was all orchestrated by me."

Yun Miaozhen nodded, "If I hadn't done that, you would have no hope of Foundation Establishment in this life. You are my blood sister, so of course, I must consider your well-being. This was for your own good."

Upon hearing this, Lü Yang was speechless.

*Damn it, the righteous path has lunatics!*

If Lü Yang had harbored any aspirations towards Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, the renowned leader of the righteous path, he now had absolutely no such thoughts.

He'd rather stay in the Sacred Sect.

Every disciple in the Sacred Sect is a special talent; I super love it here!

"Come on, go back with me."

On the other side, Yun Miaozhen completely disregarded the expressions of Lü Yang and Yun Miaoqing, and spoke clearly, "I'll think of another way for you to overcome this grand tribulation..."

"No!"

Faced with Yun Miaozhen's persuasion, Yun Miaoqing instinctively took a step back, looking at her blood sister as if she were a stranger.

After all, she could never have imagined that the experience ten years ago, when she fell into the hands of the Demonic Sect and was driven to despair, was actually orchestrated by her own blood sister. If she hadn't met Lü Yang and preserved her life and purity, she might have already been refined into medicinal dregs and died in some forgotten corner!

"...Be obedient."

Seeing Yun Miaoqing's reaction, Yun Miaozhen's delicate brows furrowed slightly: "You don't cultivate grand divine abilities, nor do you understand karma, so naturally, it's hard for you to grasp my painstaking efforts."

"...Painstaking efforts?"

Yun Miaoqing took another step back, her voice full of resentment: "Setting me up and throwing me into the Demonic Sect, letting me be humiliated by others – is that your painstaking effort for me?"

"I am conforming to karma and acting on behalf of Heaven. When you achieve success in the immortal path in the future, you will naturally thank me."

Yun Miaozhen's tone was calm. In her view, there was nothing improper about her actions; everything was natural and arranged by karma and destiny.

Seeing that Yun Miaoqing still wanted to argue, she simply waved her hand. A brilliant light enveloped Yun Miaoqing, rendering her unconscious before casually placing her beside herself.

"When minds don't meet, a word too many is useless. I won't argue with you over this now."

Having done all this, she looked back at Lü Yang.

"What is fellow Daoist Yun looking at me for?" Lü Yang raised an eyebrow.

Yun Miaozhen's beautiful eyes gazed at him, her expression cold, and she merely said lightly: "You painstakingly ruined Miaoqing's cultivation. I wish to borrow something from you to compensate."

Lü Yang burst into laughter at her words: "You wouldn't be trying to borrow my splendid head, would you?"

His words were full of mockery.

Yun Miaozhen nodded slightly, not angered, but her phoenix eyes narrowed, revealing chilling killing intent: "If you are unwilling, then don't blame me for eliminating demons and guarding the Dao."

With that, she raised her delicate hand!

In an instant, a clear light illuminated an area of ten li. It was a crystal-clear Dharma sword resembling glazed glass, with ten li of mountains and rivers reflected on its blade.

"Do you really think I'm afraid of you?"

Lü Yang laughed arrogantly, then turned and leaped, instantly transforming into an escape light and hiding within the market city. The Hundred Bones Returning to Truth Grand Formation and the Blood Rinsing Heavenly River Sword Formation Diagram activated instantly.

*A latent dragon in the abyss, who can kill me?*

Yun Miaozhen, seeing this, merely gave a cold smile. Without hesitation, an escape light soared into the sky, directly breaking through the grand formation and rushing into the market city!

In an instant, countless gazes from inside and outside the market city converged.

After all, with Ouyang Haoze's previous example, everyone knew that the Blood Robe Pavilion Master was a Ninth-rank Formation Master, possessing a grand formation that made him innately undefeated.

Under such circumstances, where did Yun Miaozhen get the confidence to boldly trespass into the market city?

Almost simultaneously, several figures appeared outside the market city, including Elder Ouyang Feng of Divine Martial Gate and Luo Wuya, the second senior brother of the Three Rivers Association.

However, these two Qi Condensation Great Perfection cultivators both had grim expressions at this moment.

Their gazes, however, were focused on another direction in the market city, on the plain-looking middle-aged man who had come with Yun Miaozhen.

"'Taiyi Sword' Yun Zhiqiu?"

Luo Wuya's face was solemn, clearly familiar with the middle-aged man: "Skeleton Mountain is not in your Jiangnan. Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion is certainly meddling too broadly."

Yun Zhiqiu chuckled lightly: "My Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion only concerns itself with protecting the righteous path, and the righteous path knows no regional distinctions."

"What nerve!"

Luo Wuya was so angered by these words that he laughed instead: "You'd better pray that your junior martial sister comes out alive first."

Yun Zhiqiu glanced at Lü Yang and Yun Miaozhen, then shook his head: "After all, it's a Demonic Sect; they only resort to such unseemly methods."

"However, how can heterodox paths contend with my orthodox divine arts?"

Before his words finished, Yun Miaozhen within the market city formed a hand seal and pointed. The glazed Dharma sword she had activated instantly burst forth with a dazzlingly brilliant light.

"That's..."

Seeing this, Luo Wuya and Ouyang Feng seemed to recall something, their expressions changing drastically: "The Heaven's Escape Sword!? This woman actually possesses such a treasured item?"

The next second, the sword light encompassed the surrounding heavens and earth.

Lü Yang activated the formations, but both the Hundred Bones Returning to Truth Grand Formation and the Blood Rinsing Heavenly River Sword Formation Diagram were completely ignored by that sword light, which passed through them as if they were nothing.

*Boom!*

When the sword light dissipated, only the two grand formations, still operating, remained in the market city. There was no one within the formations, only a glazed Dharma sword hanging high in the sky!
