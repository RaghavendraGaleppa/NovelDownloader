# Chapter 59: Ghost Mist  

Countless crystalline ice particles shimmered with a chilling glow in Lin Xuan's palm—each one a sharp, needle-like projectile.  

Since this was a sneak attack, he naturally chose his most lethal technique, aiming for a single decisive strike!  

Previously, Lin Xuan could only control about a hundred ice needles at once. But now, having reached the sixth layer of the Lingdong stage, his capacity had doubled, and the power of his ice needles had increased significantly.  

Yet Lin Xuan didn't immediately unleash the spell. Instead, he retrieved a small bottle from his robes and took a sip of the Redvine Grass liquid inside.  

Ye Tian muttered an incantation, and ghostly mist surged from his Hundred Souls Banner. Judging by his movements, he seemed to be casting a detection-type spell. As Ye Tian gradually stepped closer, Lin Xuan wasted no more time. Channeling his spiritual energy, he unleashed the hundreds of ice needles in his hand.  

A flash of cold light streaked through the air—but Ye Tian reacted with astonishing speed. His expression darkened as he tightened his grip on the Hundred Souls Banner, and the surrounding ghost mist frantically converged around him. Within the mist, the faint outline of a skeletal shield materialized.  

A rapid succession of *clinks* and *clangs* rang out as the ice needles struck the shield. With a sharp *crack*, the shield shattered, and Ye Tian spat out a mouthful of blood. However, the ice needles had also been completely exhausted.  

Lin Xuan let out a surprised *huh* before bursting out from the ground. Without hesitation, he flung a mid-grade Firebird Talisman toward Ye Tian. A wave of scorching heat surged forward. Gritting his teeth, Ye Tian summoned a crimson skull from the Hundred Souls Banner, which clashed with the Firebird Spell and dissipated it.  

**"You?!"**  

Recognition and fury flashed across Ye Tian's face as he identified his attacker. He had initially assumed it was one of the elite disciples from his sect—never expecting it to be Lin Xuan, someone without even a spiritual root.  

**"The master hides his true skill! Who would have guessed Junior Brother Lin has reached the fourth layer?"** Ye Tian gnashed his teeth, both shocked and suspicious. How could an ordinary person progress so quickly? Could he also be a demonic cultivator like himself?  

No—even demonic cultivation shouldn’t yield such rapid advancement. The fourth layer already placed Lin Xuan at the mid-tier among disciples who had entered the valley at the same time.  

Without a spiritual root, such speed was impossible.  

Confusion piled upon confusion!  

What Ye Tian didn’t realize was that he had still underestimated Lin Xuan’s cultivation. His opponent had actually reached the sixth layer, just like him. The misjudgment stemmed from Lin Xuan’s consumption of the Redvine Grass liquid.  

This miraculous elixir formed a spherical barrier within his dantian, concealing his true strength while allowing him to wield his full power unimpeded—a perfect two-fold advantage.  

In battle, misleading an opponent about one’s strength offered numerous benefits. It could lull them into underestimating their foe, creating opportunities for sudden strikes.  

Of course, hiding one’s power wasn’t always about going as low as possible—it depended on the situation. Here, Lin Xuan concealed his strength at the fourth layer because that was the minimum level required to plausibly master the Ice Needle Technique. If he had shown only the first layer while wielding such a formidable spell, it would have raised even more suspicion and put Ye Tian on higher alert.  

The fourth layer was just right—enough to mislead Ye Tian about his true power, ensuring the latter would inevitably reveal openings in battle.  

Combat wasn’t merely a contest of strength but also of wits. Combining both was the surest path to victory.  

Yet at this moment, Lin Xuan wasn’t entirely at ease. His initial plan—ambushing Ye Tian from underground with the powerful Ice Needle Technique—had been calculated to guarantee a one-hit kill. Yet Ye Tian had blocked it. The young man’s vigilance and cunning were only part of the problem.  

The true concern was the terrifying might of the Hundred Souls Banner.  

This battle would be far more challenging than his fight against the Yan Family’s patriarch. Still, though Lin Xuan remained cautious, he wasn’t worried. After all, he was no longer the same person from three months ago—he now stood at the sixth layer of the Lingdong stage.  

Both men regarded each other warily, with no intention of exchanging pleasantries. Having failed in his ambush, Lin Xuan didn’t rush to attack again, opting instead to counterstrike at the right moment.  

Though Ye Tian was equally cunning, he lacked Lin Xuan’s patience. Raising the Hundred Souls Banner with his right hand, he began slowly waving it.  

Instantly, black mist billowed forth, teeming with ghostly apparitions. Horrifying specters materialized before their eyes, accompanied by spine-chilling wails.  

Yet Lin Xuan remained unfazed, a mocking smile playing on his lips. If these illusions were real, they would require at least late-stage Foundation Building cultivation to manifest. Given Ye Tian’s current spiritual power, sustaining such a technique was impossible—this was clearly an illusion.  

But illusions weren’t harmless. Even knowing they were fake, the sheer terror they invoked could weaken an opponent, leaving them trembling, drenched in sweat, and barely able to muster a fraction of their strength.  

Lin Xuan, however, was different. Back when he was still lingering at the first layer of the Lingdong stage, he had dared to charge through the Heart-Tempering Path. Compared to those trials, the illusions before him now were child’s play.  

If Ye Tian wanted to waste his energy on this, so be it. Not only would the illusions fail against Lin Xuan, but they would also drain Ye Tian’s spiritual power—another win-win.  

Of course, Lin Xuan wouldn’t just stand idle. Victory required action.  

He retrieved a talisman from his robes—but this wasn’t an ordinary one. After his life-or-death battle with Yan Tianheng, his stock of talismans had nearly run out. This was a spoils-of-war Beast Talisman.  

Lin Xuan had chosen to deploy such a treasure immediately because he wanted a swift resolution. Though this place was remote, it wasn’t far enough from Piaoyun Valley to guarantee privacy. At any moment, someone might pass by. Just as Ye Tian didn’t want his identity as a demonic cultivator exposed, Lin Xuan had no desire for others to discover his true cultivation level.  

It was precisely because both harbored these concerns that they had tacitly relocated their battle to this isolated clearing. Even so, the risk of being discovered remained.  

As Lin Xuan channeled spiritual energy into the Beast Talisman to unlock its power, Ye Tian also sprang into action. Seeing that his ghostly illusions had no effect, he wasn’t foolish enough to keep wasting energy.  

With a shake of the Hundred Souls Banner, he withdrew the mist, then swiftly cast another incantation. A surge of yin energy erupted as several disheveled, vengeful spirits emerged from the banner.
