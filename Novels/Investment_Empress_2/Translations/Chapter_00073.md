# Chapter 73: The First Battle of the Ice Cube

“Slash the Wind!”

A furious shout rang out.

In the critical moment, the Broken Sword was actually controlled by Xiao Qin and pulled back. It not only blocked the opponent's sword, but the abundant internal energy also burst forth violently.

A circle of pale green internal energy emanated from the Broken Sword, sweeping forward in a fan shape.

Internal energy released externally!

The term flashed through the minds of many people.

Xiao Qin had clearly only broken through recently. The fact that he knew this technique was impressive; many internal energy martial artists could only achieve this at the Jade Liquid Realm.

Immediately, gasps of astonishment sounded throughout the arena.

On the high platform.

“This Xiao Qin isn't bad, just a bit low in cultivation,” someone remarked.

“He must be one of the top disciples of the Qingyuan Sect in this generation,” another guessed.

The arrogant-looking youth from Fenyu Lin spoke indifferently. “An Internal Energy Realm or Condensing Qi Realm cultivator at eighteen or nineteen years old—his talent is already extremely high.”

“Of course, he is still far inferior to you, Yu,” the middle-aged man in a scholar's robe added with a faint smile.

The disciples of Fenyu Lin showed some surprise, but not much. Most of those who followed them to the Qingyuan Sect came from prestigious backgrounds. To them, Xiao Qin was commendable only for his combat talent.

The people of the Chijing Gang on the side, however, seemed much more excited. Many of them had risen from the lower ranks of the Jianghu and greatly favored Xiao Qin's fighting spirit. Quite a few even began cheering for him.

“Wasn't Xiao Qin an outer disciple before?” Qian Bufan asked, having some impression of the youth.

“Yes, he is also a child who rose suddenly. Perhaps he obtained some opportunity,” Xue Jing said with a smile, stroking his beard.

The elders nodded slightly.

Based on Xiao Qin's performance, whether he won or lost this battle, he was qualified to become a true disciple.

The battle in the arena continued.

Little Li was no longer a novice in the Dao of martial arts. Thanks to his time shuttling between the Ice Cube and Princess Jiang, and the fact that his beautiful Master liked to boast about who she had beaten up after drinking too much, Li Mo had accumulated quite a bit of insight.

Watching the two figures exchanging blows on the stage, Li Mo shook his head slightly.

“Old Xiao still won't find it easy to win.”

Old Xiao relied on releasing his internal energy to match an opponent who was a whole realm higher. However, this method consumed a great deal of energy.

Xie Ailan was clearly not a fool with no combat experience; she had already noticed this and began using her superior movement techniques to engage in a fluid battle.

Ying Bing retracted her gaze, lowered her eyes, and took a sip of tea.

“Three breaths.”

Her voice had just fallen.

Not more, not less.

Exactly three breaths.

Xiao Qin suddenly relaxed his strength, his face pale as he cupped his fists.

“Senior Sister, I admit defeat.”

Xie Ailan stopped moving, didn't even glance at her opponent, and walked off the stage without a word to adjust her breathing.

Qian Bufan's deep voice rang out across the arena.

“Xie Ailan, victory!”

“Xiao Qin, enter the losers' bracket! If you lose the next match, you will be eliminated.”

To ensure fairness, the Nine Peaks Martial Gathering did not eliminate a disciple after a single loss; one had to lose two consecutive matches to ensure a relatively reasonable result.

Of course, if one happened to face an opponent far superior in strength twice in a row, it was simply bad luck.

The first match was already so exciting that the atmosphere in the现场 immediately became even more heated.

Qian Bufan patted the bronze beast again, causing two waist tokens to fall from the ox's mouth.

“The next match.”

“Inner Disciple Lu Bai versus...”

“Ruyi Peak's Lin Jiang!”

...

This was a battle with little suspense.

If one had to describe this match, it could only be said that it truly allowed everyone to see the gap between an inner disciple and a true disciple.

Lin Jiang's spear shot out like a dragon, his Qi and blood majestic.

The opponent used the same moves, but within ten exchanges, he was swept off the stage by Lin Jiang's spear shaft.

After bowing to his opponent, Lin Jiang didn't look at the high platform, but instead looked toward the disciples' seating area. Only after seeing that familiar figure did a smile appear on his face.

“Old Lin has made great progress recently too,” Li Mo thought.

Li Mo met his gaze and returned a smile. He had run into Lin Jiang occasionally recently, and they had even discussed martial arts problems together.

Little Li suddenly felt a bit emotional. Watching the people he had helped shine brightly... it gave him a sense of accomplishment, like playing a nurturing game.

“Lin Jiang wins!”

“Next match...”

...

An hour passed.

During this time, Murong Xiao also stepped onto the stage once, winning with a huge advantage and gaining a lot of attention and praise.

“He must be the most outstanding genius of this generation,” the arrogant youth from Fenyu Lin said, looking eager to try, as if he had found a worthy opponent. If not for the rules, it looked like he would want to go up and fight him.

“You can seek him out for a spar after the Nine Peaks Martial Gathering,” the scholar-robed middle-aged man said.

The Blood-Clothed Young Master of the Chijing Gang looked on with great interest.

“The body of a鸣蛟 (Roaring Flood Dragon)? The demonic nature is controlled so well?”

“His body is faintly golden, and this peaceful aura seems like a Buddhist martial art.”

“Interesting...”

Seeing his interest, the Lord of Ziyang Mansion lowered his voice.

“Young Master, this youth is a member of the Murong family. Presumably, he will return to the mansion city.”

“Understood.”

The Blood-Clothed Young Master nodded indifferently. Strangely enough, as a disciple of the Chijing Gang, he treated a Lord of a Mansion with such casualness.

“Cold Crane has taught a good disciple,” someone on the platform remarked.

“Murong Xiao is indeed gifted with extraordinary talent, a fine vessel for body forging. If his forging talent is good, the Qingyuan Sect will produce another Great Artisan.”

“The uniqueness of his physique will become even more pronounced at the Divine Observation Realm. That will be when he truly shines.”

Listening to the envy of his colleagues, Elder Leng He's bark-like face also beamed with a smile.

Murong Xiao was indeed the disciple most likely to take over his mantle.

His luck was quite good...

“Murong Xiao...”

“That's the young fellow who follows my precious disciple's ass all day long, calling him 'Brother Li'?” a voice came from the Master of Qunyu Peak, somewhat out of place.

“Yes, his relationship with my grand-disciple is indeed quite good,” Xue Jing also said with a smile.

As disciples of the Qingyuan Sect, the elders were naturally more willing to see the outstanding disciples on good terms, so they could work together if anything happened in the future.

The only one not feeling pleased was...

*Creak.*

Elder Leng He's smile froze. With a force of his hand, he almost crushed the armrest of his chair.

The most outstanding disciple of the Divine Weapon Peak was Li Mo's little shadow.

The Divine Weapon of the Divine Weapon Peak was also in that boy's hands.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he became.

Wasn't this just a form of...

“Hmph, Niece Shang Wu, it's still too early for you to be happy.”

“I know you bet on Qunyu Peak being ranked first among the peaks. I don't know where you got the courage!”

As soon as these words fell.

The elders' gazes swished toward Shang Wu, filled with confusion, as if to say:

'We know you're usually eccentric, but this is just too much.'

'How dare you?'

'My grand-disciple is still just a child.'

Actually...

By the time Shang Wu remembered that Little Bing was not a disciple of Qunyu Peak, she had gone through three stages: disbelief, then regret, and finally... giving up.

Since she couldn't change the result, she might as well let it be...

Shang Wu took a sip of wine indifferently, not caring in the slightest.

“Because, I believe in my precious disciple.”

The Elders: “!”

Why was she so confident? This wasn't like her.

Everyone knew Shang Wu was obsessed with money and wouldn't act without guaranteed profit. Yet, she dared to place such a huge bet on her disciple.

Could it be... that the sole heir of Qunyu Peak really had some terrifying backing?

Elder Leng He fell into deep thought.

Could that boy possibly...

Already be able to use the Divine Weapon?

...

Fights between martial artists actually didn't have much flashiness. If there was a gap in strength, determining the winner was a very simple matter.

Moreover, this was a sparring match between fellow sect members, not a life-and-death battle.

Another match ended quickly.

Qian Bufan patted the bronze ox again.

“Next match.”

“Xie Ailan of Luoxia Peak versus...”

“Ying Bing of the Qingyuan Main Peak!”
