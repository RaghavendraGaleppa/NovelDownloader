# Chapter 52: The Last Young Master of Lin Family Fort  

Half an hour earlier.  

Outside Yangliu Town, two men stood facing each other—one with a sword, the other with a blade.  

Fresh blood dripped from the sharp black edge of the sword, pooling at its tip before falling onto the freshly laid snow like a drop of vermilion.  

A cold wind tugged at Lin Musheng’s tattered brocade robes, making them flutter loudly.  

The young man, barely in his twenties, trembled as he gripped the hilt of his sword, his body hunched over from severe injuries. His eyes remained locked on the black-robed middle-aged swordsman whose artery he had severed just moments ago.  

The swordsman clutched his wound, but blood still seeped relentlessly through his fingers. A violent energy surged through his veins, unstoppable. His eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at the young man, as if wanting to speak, but no words came. With a final glare, he collapsed into the snow.  

Only after killing his opponent did Lin Musheng lower his guard. Staggering to a withered tree, he leaned against it to catch his breath.  

He longed to lie down, to let the earth be his bed and the snow his blanket, to sleep deeply. But he knew he couldn’t.  

He had only won by sheer luck, and his own injuries were severe.  

From the moment he encountered this assassin, the two had clashed across the wilderness, their fierce battle igniting patches of dry grass and felling nearby beasts with the shockwaves of their spiritual energy. Feigning weakness, Lin Musheng had lured his opponent into a trap before gathering all his remaining strength to unleash a sudden, fatal sword strike.  

"Cough—"  

A mouthful of poisoned blood forced its way up his throat.  

The assassin’s blade had been laced with a hidden toxin, which Lin Musheng had inhaled. Now, it gnawed at his organs.  

The blood spread across the snow like a creeping plague, staining the pristine white with darkness—a grotesque painting.  

He knew the dead man before him was a traitor sent by his third uncle, who had betrayed the Lin Family Fort’s ancestral teachings in his greed for power. The assassin had left marks behind; more killers would come soon.  

He couldn’t stay here. He had to find shelter.  

Less than seven days after his father’s death, his third uncle had abandoned all morals, colluding with dark forces to eliminate Lin Musheng’s bloodline. His mother had sacrificed herself to buy him time to escape through the family’s secret passage.  

Even the loyal wandering monk who had once served the Lin Family—a fortune-teller who had stayed for eight years out of gratitude—had died protecting him.  

The monk had foreseen this calamity.  

Before dying, he had cast one last divination for Lin Musheng:  

"Go to Longxiang County. You will live."  

Six simple words.  

Then, he had breathed his last.  

Lin Musheng felt despair creeping in. No matter how carefully he hid, his pursuers always found him. After twenty years of a carefree young master’s life, this sudden upheaval had left him lost.  

From his robes, he retrieved an ancient pipa headstock, its surface carved with intricate dragon patterns.  

"If not for this treasure, how could a mere Qi Refining fifth-level swordsman like me have killed these damned traitors?"  

His mother had entrusted it to him, originally intending to gift it upon his breakthrough to the sixth level.  

"This is the Lin Family Fort’s most precious heirloom," she had said. "Our ancestors used it to enter the path of cultivation, and it built the foundation of our family’s fortune. But your father’s meridians were ruined by it. Those without fate cannot wield it. I don’t know if giving it to you is right, but I know it must never fall into your uncle’s hands. Take it… and leave the rest to destiny."  

"Leave it to destiny"—her final words.  

Even with the treasure, Lin Musheng’s spiritual energy was in turmoil. If he didn’t recover soon, he wouldn’t survive.  

Death didn’t frighten him. But he refused to die before avenging his family.  

Clutching the pipa headstock, he gazed up at the falling snow, wondering why his virtuous family had met such a cruel fate.  

A faint energy pulsed from the artifact, as if urging him forward.  

Ahead, a hazy city loomed in the distance.  

*Shink—*  

He sheathed his bloodstained sword, the sound sharpening his focus.  

Channeling spiritual energy into the pipa headstock, he unleashed a ghostly blue flame that engulfed the assassin’s corpse, reducing it to ash. The wind scattered the remains, erasing all traces.  

With the evidence destroyed, Lin Musheng fixed his eyes on the city.  

The fortune-telling monk had promised he would survive if he reached Longxiang County.  

Yet after months of fleeing—through mountains, villages, and towns—his pursuers always found him.  

Exhausted in body and spirit, he made his decision.  

He would enter the city.  

In a populated area, his uncle’s assassins wouldn’t dare act too brazenly.  

Bracing against the snowstorm, he trudged toward Yangliu Town.  

His footprints faded quickly, buried by the relentless wind and snow.  

---  

Silently slipping past patrolling guards and night watchmen, he found himself before a Taoist temple.  

"Yuanshen Temple. What a strange name," he mused.  

Yet the place calmed him. Even the artifact in his arms seemed to hum with energy.  

Perhaps it was just his imagination.  

As he climbed the steps, he noticed a large signboard.  

The words were odd:  

*"The Yuanshen Temple still holds power! This year, a child born under its blessing was accepted as a disciple by the Fuyao Sect—a natural-born Dao Seed!"*  

This was Yingxiao’s doing—a scheme to revive the temple’s dwindling reputation. At first, Xiao Ji had refused, finding it shameless. But for the sake of attracting worshippers, he had reluctantly agreed… after his master intervened.  

The sign was entirely Yingxiao’s idea.  

A sharp pain flared in Lin Musheng’s organs. He needed to suppress the poison immediately.  

Panicked, he vaulted over the wall into the courtyard, his nerves taut.  

Carrying a mystical artifact, he couldn’t risk knocking. If he passed out and the temple’s priests proved untrustworthy, he’d lose both his life and the treasure.  

His eyes landed on the massive incense burner in the courtyard.  

Without hesitation, he leaped inside, burying himself up to his waist in snow and ash, only his upper body visible.  

The burner was large enough that unless someone peered inside, he wouldn’t be seen.  

Moments later, the crunch of snow underfoot reached his ears.  

He looked up—and met the gaze of a young Taoist priest leaning over the burner’s rim.  

"Are you impersonating our temple’s founder?" Xiao Ji asked, tilting his head. "And since when does our founder sit inside an incense burner?"
