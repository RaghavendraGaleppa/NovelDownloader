# Chapter 117: Near-Immortal Object

In the central area of the colossal pit, the crystallization was even more severe, the ground barren and riddled with holes. There was no way the imagined immortal medicine could take root and grow here.

Everything in this place was laid bare. Qin Ming's eyes glowed with fervor as he stood before the near-immortal object, just an arm's length away.

It was a heavily damaged furnace, riddled with holes. Even in such poor condition, it still shimmered with immortal light, wreathed in auspicious mists, with white fog billowing from its opening.

Furthermore, it was accompanied by strange phenomena: within the luminous mist, scenes of successful pill refinement occasionally appeared—dragons and tigers intertwined, and alchemical qi soared into the sky, as if the furnace was about to open and release some wondrous elixirs.

This was precisely why Chen Shuhang and Jiang Congyun had suddenly attacked Qin Ming. Upon seeing the expanding alchemical qi, dragon roars, and tiger leaps, the two had lost their heads, believing there were residual immortal medicines.

Judging solely by these miraculous sights, one knew this alchemical furnace was truly extraordinary. Even after a thousand years, it could still manifest such exceptional phenomena, far beyond imagination.

It was small, only about the height of a palm, and engraved with many runes. Its lid was half-broken and lay beside it.

"No wonder those old geezers didn't take it, leaving it for future generations. This thing is 'leaky' and too severely damaged."

Qin Ming counted. The palm-sized furnace body alone had nine holes, not counting several cracks, and its lid was missing a piece.

"Such a small furnace, could it really forge weapons?" He was somewhat puzzled, as the ethereal visions emanating from it also included faint scenes of weapon refining.

Qin Ming looked surprised; this near-immortal object likely had other marvelous uses.

The furnace itself looked incredibly ancient, yet it was entwined with auspicious mists.

Qin Ming didn't dare to touch it directly. He drew out his mutton-fat jade iron saber to test it, and finding no reaction, he then gently tapped it with his fingertip.

The furnace emitted a crisp metallic echo, like a struck bell.

After confirming there were no issues, Qin Ming finally reached out, picked it up from the ground, and held it in his palm for careful observation.

"It's cast from various wondrous metals, each seemingly more precious than mutton-fat jade iron." Qin Ming instantly felt his own rare treasure saber dimmed in comparison.

The furnace body bore various characters, some inscribed, some embedded. Some special materials weren't directly melted into the furnace wall.

Certain characters were pristine white and lustrous, though their glow was rather subdued. Qin Ming instinctively felt they were even more extraordinary than mutton-fat jade iron.

There were also characters embedded with "exotic gold," bearing natural纹理 (纹理: patterns/textures) and emitting wisps of purple qi.

"I want to pry them off and forge a handy weapon." Qin Ming merely thought about it. This furnace was already a near-immortal object; who would be willing to reforge it into another weapon?

He knew very well that weapons cast from mutton-fat jade iron already possessed extraordinary properties, such as being able to slay unseen, mysterious creatures. Furthermore, if damaged, it could recover by absorbing heavenly light.

Qin Ming confirmed that the materials of this near-immortal object were even more astonishing. Despite the nine holes in the furnace body, if it were carefully "nurtured" by a person from the Beyond, it could likely be fully restored in the future.

However, such an immortal object was, after all, too severely damaged, and by an unimaginable force. It would undoubtedly require a vast amount of time to warm and nourish.

At the very least, a millennium had passed, and it hadn't recovered on its own.

"Presumably, it's precisely for this reason that it ended up in the hands of core disciples," Qin Ming had once heard Li Qingyue mention.

Even a damaged near-immortal object held infinite marvels for disciples of the Beyond, because it could receive "Heavenly Essence."

The high-level cultivators of the Beyond could truly consume ethereal vapors and rinse their mouths with morning dew.

But what they consumed wasn't the daily solar mists, but rare spiritual substances from top-tier fire springs, and what they drank wasn't nocturnal water vapor and dew, but the mysterious "Heavenly Essence" from the depths of the night sky.

If one could drink "Heavenly Essence" at the disciple stage, the benefits would naturally be immeasurable.

Thus, all disciples eyed it greedily, even the aloof Cui Chonghe didn't hesitate to violate rules and enter the area.

Qin Ming held the furnace body, examining it. It wasn't perfectly circular but had eight faces, each with distinct trigram symbols.

"This is... the Eight Trigram Furnace." He felt that merely by virtue of this shape, the furnace's origin must be extraordinary.

Qin Ming tapped the furnace wall, carefully listening to its echo. It seemed to diffuse a certain ineffable dao rhythm, which surprisingly cleared his mind.

"What a good thing! I wonder if it would also carry immortal charm and be incredibly powerful if used to smash someone."

If people from the Beyond were to hear him say that, they would probably curse him as a boor.

Qin Ming put down the Eight Trigram Furnace and placed its broken lid back on.

Then, he set his sights on another artifact: "a sheet of paper" forged from strange metals, which stirred his heart even more.

He had first examined the near-immortal object because he had heard so many legends about it, everyone talked about it, so he naturally wanted to handle it himself.

This page was also heavily fragmented, even more damaged than the Eight Trigram Furnace, with only a corner remaining, less than a quarter of its original size.

Qin Ming held it, looking at the intricate text and some diagrams on it, and immediately felt it was heavy. Its ability to be placed alongside the Eight Trigram Furnace suggested its value was unimaginable.

This "sheet of paper," forged from a mixture of various strange metals, had a total of twelve holes, leaving little content to be seen on its already small corner—either missing characters or incomplete diagrams.

For ordinary people, this remnant corner of a scripture was useless. Anyone daring to practice according to it would certainly run into major problems.

Qin Ming put it down and rubbed his hands constantly, hoping for explosive luck, that he could resonate with it.

"Near-immortal object, give me some immortal luck!" Qin Ming picked up the Eight Trigram Furnace again.

He valued the remnant scripture more, so he decided to test the waters with the Eight Trigram Furnace first.

Qin Ming concentrated intensely, preparing to resonate with the near-immortal object, to see if he could gain anything here.

Then, his eyes glazed over!

With a clang, he dropped the Eight Trigram Furnace onto the ground, breathing heavily. The mists of heavenly light burned his lungs, causing them to ache.

But this couldn't compare to the tremor in his heart. He had never encountered such a situation before—"reading" an ancient artifact and sensing the residual emotional fluctuations of the past, only to face danger.

"How strong was that old man?" Qin Ming was startled. He had sensed multiple residual emotions and chose the strongest one.

As a result, his consciousness was almost vibrated to the point of collapse.

This was no longer pure emotion, but a kind of dao rhythm, an inexplicable fluctuation. Even though it was very subtle, it made him feel as if he was facing a vast, tumultuous sea, where a single large wave could send him flying.

"Are all the old geezers from the Beyond that powerful?" Qin Ming mused.

Then, he thought of the old man who had effortlessly crushed the peerless overlord.

The old man he had just resonated with was certainly not Li Qingxu's master, but he was also a significant figure from the Beyond.

"I'm progressing step by step by relying on my physical mutation, but it seems there's still a long way to go!"

It took Qin Ming a long time to recover.

This time, he was quite cautious. After picking up the alchemical furnace, he concentrated intensely, selecting weaker emotions and avoiding that old man whose dao rhythm still flowed.

A moment later, he put down the near-immortal object, rested briefly, and then tried to "communicate" again.

Thus, Qin Ming resonated with the alchemical furnace again and again, repeatedly trying, and in the final stage, even provoked that extremely dangerous emotional current once more.

He was covered in sweat, feeling as if his head was about to explode and his spirit was on the verge of igniting. This was far more exhausting than fighting Jiang Congyun and Chen Shuhang.

But Qin Ming was immensely satisfied; his eyes and eyebrows shone with joy.

If anyone were here, they would surely think he was grinning foolishly, completely lacking any image.

Qin Ming gained tremendously this time. He resonated with a mysterious incantation within the near-immortal object, which surprisingly spoke of the Six Ding Divine Flames!

Only by using this flame could one activate the Eight Trigram Furnace for alchemy and weapon refining.

Qin Ming had naturally heard of the Six Ding Divine Flames, because they were simply too high-end, related to the near-immortal creatures and god-like beings dwelling in the vast and boundless depths of the Night Mist World.

Only during the Great Reclamation Era could one witness such terrifying flames.

Qin Ming somewhat suspected that the Eight Trigram Furnace might not have been refined by the people of the Beyond themselves, but rather obtained from near-immortal or god-like beings during the Great Opening Era.

His cultivated Li Fire Scripture was already considered a very precious wondrous art, but what it produced was merely Li Fire, completely incomparable to the Six Ding Divine Flames.

Unless it was the "Southern Bright Li Fire," which was above Li Fire and also a wondrous flame mastered by god-like beings.

"As expected of a near-immortal object, you've given me such a huge surprise!" Qin Ming praised, patting the Eight Trigram Furnace as if it were a musical instrument, listening to its sound.

His thoughts drifted, and he muttered to himself, "The Night Mist World is boundless; it seems to hide a vast number of secrets. Near-immortal, god-like... even developing a small corner of it holds immense value."

Soon, he regained his focus. Those things were too far away from him.

Even the objects before him made him feel somewhat helpless.

Because the Six Ding Divine Flames were too high a level, even with the incantation, he couldn't cultivate them now.

Even with the wondrous art of the Li Fire Scripture, he had only reached the second realm. This was only after improving his foundation in the Mountain River Spiritual Nest, allowing him to cultivate parts of the Outer Sage domain here.

"I'm guarding a treasure mountain in vain," Qin Ming murmured.

Then, he shook his head and laughed, saying, "No, not entirely. I'll save it for the future and slowly uncover its secrets."

Undoubtedly, the Six Ding Divine Flames were too high-end; no matter where they were placed, they would be enough to command respect.

"I wonder if the Beyond still has this incantation. Perhaps I've brought it back into the world this time."

Qin Ming caressed the near-immortal object, set it aside, and once again held the remnant page in his hand. After calming his mind, he began to resonate.

Indeed, within this, there was also the terrifying old man's emotion, imbued with dao rhythm. Qin Ming avoided it and resonated with other residual emotions.

Once, twice... he repeatedly made contact, constantly perceiving, and in the final stage, even "offended" the old man's presence to confirm that the obtained scripture was correct.

He dropped the remnant page, fell backward onto the ground, breathing heavily. He let the terrifying heavenly light mists burn his mouth and nose, and it took him a long while to recover.

"Qingyue has quite a fortune; this is definitely something from a true core inheritance!" Qin Ming muttered to himself.

In fact, it was true. There was only this single "sheet of paper" here, coexisting with the Eight Trigram Furnace, carrying astonishing secret methods.

"It has an incredible origin!" Qin Ming looked at the paper; its material was similar to that of the Eight Trigram Furnace.

"I wonder if I'll be able to cultivate this technique when my cultivation level is sufficient in the future." He touched the remnant paper.

On this metallic paper, he saw that old man warning his closed-door disciple not to even think about it or touch this paper until reaching the third realm, otherwise, serious problems would arise, even leading to death from cultivation deviation.

"No need to think so much for now!" Qin Ming stood up. The path was long, the future distant; currently, he needed to advance step by step, firmly grounded.

He searched around, wondering if there were any other items.

"Hm?!" Qin Ming was surprised. With a try-and-see attitude, he dug three feet deep and actually found something: a small amount of metallic nuggets embedded in the crystallized ground.

He gazed intently, his heart unable to calm. The material was too special; some resembled purple gold but were clearly different, imbued with dense, mystical patterns.

Some were pure white like jade, but even more subdued than mutton-fat jade iron, with a certain inexplicable divine charm hidden within.

Qin Ming patiently scoured and excavated this area, eventually finding a handful of metal fragments, but together they didn't even amount to the size of a fist.

He could already tell that these mysterious materials had once been integrated into some mighty artifacts. For example, that piece of purple gold still retained a slight edge of a sword.

That piece of "crimson copper" should have originally been a spear tip!

Looking at it this way, many extraordinary and formidable artifacts had been utterly destroyed, and only the essence—the strange metals mixed within—had survived.

Qin Ming's eyes changed; this handful of items might be priceless!

Luofu Immortal Mountain, in the past, was the most top-tier blessed land, a major foundation for the people of the Beyond. Otherwise, they wouldn't have thought of pushing for its transformation into a Heaven-Grotto.

The remnants here were truly astonishing.

Qin Ming stuffed all the strange metal nuggets into his怀 (怀: bosom/pocket). He searched the area several more times, confirming that there was truly nothing else to be found.

He prepared to leave; it was time to face the challenges outside.

He put the damaged furnace lid and the remnant page into his pocket as well, to prevent their loss during a major battle.

Then, Qin Ming, holding one leg of the near-immortal furnace, walked out through the dense heavenly light.
