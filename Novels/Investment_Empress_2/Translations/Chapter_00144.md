# Chapter 144: "I'm Planning to Build a Hot Spring in the Yard"

Inside the World Seed.

The sun in the sky continued to expand and contract.

Because he had transformed it into the sun of his small world, Li Mo had a particularly clear perception of his Xuan Dan.

"It can still be compressed further..."

Li Mo sank his mind and spirit, continuing to compress his Xuan Dan.

*Sss—*

The Karma Fire surged, expanding and contracting, causing wind and clouds to rise within the small world.

This step was not easy.

Fortunately, Li Mo's soul was powerful, and coupled with the fact that this was within his small world, he kept it within a controllable range.

After an unknown period of stalemate.

*BOOM—*

A thunderous sound erupted simultaneously from Li Mo's body in both the small world and the real world.

"What's wrong with my son?"

Gu Xueqin was extremely nervous, but she was afraid of disturbing her son and didn't dare to walk in.

"This... is he condensing a Xuan Dan?"

Li Dalong looked towards the house, stunned.

The fluctuation coming from the house was indeed the movement of condensing a Xuan Dan.

But this movement...

Wasn't it a bit too grand?

"This shows that the Xuan Dan he is condensing is extraordinary."

A voice suddenly came from behind.

Not far away.

Shangguan Wencang suddenly appeared in the courtyard, his clear, bright old eyes looking towards the interior.

High-ranking members from various large and small sects had also followed him over.

Normally, a disciple breaking through to the Inner Breath realm wouldn't have such a spectacle.

It was just that everyone was quite curious about Little Li.

As soon as everyone stepped into the courtyard.

*Hum—*

A aura that seemed to burn away all evil karma spread from within the house.

The many powerhouses felt the scorching sensation on their bodies grow more and more intense.

"This power..."

Shangguan Wencang murmured to himself, his eyes widening slightly.

The others looked at each other in bewilderment.

They had been somewhat skeptical of what Ying Bing had said before, but now they were starting to doubt it.

Which Inner Breath realm martial artist in the world, when condensing a Xuan Dan, could make even the Inner Scene feel pressure?

And what was strange was that the heat everyone felt seemed to be different.

For instance, Ying Bing was completely unaffected.

The elders of the Clear Abyss Sect were also affected very little.

The Hall Master of the Blue Whale Gang, on the other hand, was sweating profusely.

A realization faintly rose in their hearts.

"Does this power... perhaps originate from themselves?"

Everyone became even more alarmed.

"Master, is Mo'er alright?" Li Dalong asked in a low voice, worried about his son in the end.

The commotion of breaking through to the Xuan Dan realm was truly too abnormal.

"It's fine."

Looking at the worried couple, Xue Jing thought to himself, *'This is nothing. You haven't seen your son jump into a cauldron and refine himself like a pill.'*

He pondered for a moment and asked in an uncertain tone:

"The aura of Li Mo's Xuan Dan condensation is somewhat similar to what the Buddhist sect calls Karma Fire."

"It is somewhat similar."

Shangguan Wencang nodded.

Karma Fire uses the karma of all things as fuel.

This concept wasn't proposed by the Buddhist sect, but it was popularized by them.

"In that case, the reason we feel hot is because of our own karma?"

Qian Bufan suddenly understood.

*Oh, my.*

Li Mo is practically a natural enemy of sin from now on.

"Karma Fire? Is that something a Xuan Dan realm expert can master?"

"Perhaps it's just similar..."

"That's still terrifying enough."

Everyone felt a bit of a scalp-tingling fear.

Even if it was just a similar thing, it was truly frightening.

The moment they thought of Karma Fire, they suddenly understood.

Han Zhen had lived for thousands of years. He had definitely done things like fabricating the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm and massacring innocent people. He might have committed even more heinous acts that are too numerous to record.

Karma Fire can ignite the karma of others.

The deeper one's karma, the greater the damage they receive.

This makes it barely explainable...

Knowing his son was safe, Li Dalong immediately breathed a sigh of relief, his face beaming with joy.

He saw that everyone was sweating and asked:

"Senior uncles, it's hot. Would you like some watermelon?"

"Good... no thanks, I'm not that hot."

---

"I'm not hot either."

"Hmm, this Seat is quite cool, haha..."

"Old Qian, why are you sweating so much? If you're hot, just say so. I'll have my disciple cut you some watermelon."

"Damn you! This is just my natural physique!"

"Does swearing count as karma?"

The many sweating Inner Scene powerforces began to laugh it off with each other.

They were all mortals living in the mortal world; who among them doesn't have a little karma?

At this moment.

The commotion inside the house slowly subsided.

Li Mo let out a heavy breath of turbid air and opened his eyes in delight.

At this moment.

The sun in his small world had completely stabilized.

In his Dantian, a deep red Xuan Dan was slowly rotating, inhaling and exhaling a massive amount of Inner Breath.

This meant he was now officially a late-stage Inner Breath expert!

He was only one step away from the Observation of the Divine realm!

"Three hundred and sixty-five... and I only have one."

*'The road ahead is long and arduous. I'll take it slow.'*

Li Mo wasn't in a hurry.

The number of Xuan Dan didn't affect his entry into the Observation of the Divine realm.

He manipulated the Xuan Dan to fly up and down a few times, feeling it was as easy as using his own limbs. After all, he had prior experience from his joint attacks with Junior Brother Xiao Bao.

Walking out of the room, he saw the group of people who were sweating profusely but still insisting they weren't hot.

"Huh?"

"Good, good, good. My son has finally formed his Xuan Dan."

Old Li stepped forward and patted Li Mo's shoulder with emotion:

"Sending you to the Clear Abyss Sect back then was definitely the right choice."

"I will continue to study diligently under Master."

Li Mo was also touched.

Old Li's expression froze, and he began to consider whether he and his wife should have a second child.

That day, Little Li and the large group set off on the return journey to the Clear Abyss Sect.

.......

Three days later.

A magnificent war chariot appeared in the Clear Abyss Mountain Range.

It wasn't that Qian Bufan had suddenly become generous; he was famously stingy.

There was a reason for using the war chariot.

Shangguan Wencang had decided to let Ying Bing enter the main peak's ancestral hall to walk the path of the Observation of the Divine realm. The auspicious time was set for tomorrow.

That's why everyone had rushed back without stopping.

At the front of the war chariot.

A young man's robes fluttered in the wind as he looked up at the sky.

In his eyes, there seemed to be a burning of deep red fire. However, the more he observed, the deeper his frown became.

It was strange.

He had now condensed a Karma Fire Xuan Dan and should be able to observe the sun. But when he looked, he felt that the three suns, besides being scorching hot, also vaguely resembled a vortex, moving around each other in a mysterious trajectory. Just looking at them made his head ache.

"The sun cannot be looked at directly."

A pleasant voice came from behind.

"But last night, you were looking at the moon," Li Mo withdrew his gaze and rubbed his aching brow.

"The sun and the moon are different," Ying Bing said softly as she shook her head.

"How are they different?" Li Mo was curious.

All living creatures work at sunrise and rest at sunset. Countless people use the sun to judge time. Ordinary people can look at it, but why can't one use it to observe the Divine?

"Only the Great Yu Imperial Clan can observe the Great Sun's Deity," Ying Bing said, lowering her eyes.

Standing here, they could already see the Autumn Water Pavilion.

Li Mo curled his lips.

Perhaps the Martial Ancestor Emperor had set up a method to maintain his dynasty for ten thousand generations?

The inherent flaws of feudal dynasties...

In that case, Princess Jiang should be able to observe it.

Not long after.

The two returned to the Autumn Water Pavilion.

Shang Wu had already returned. As expected, the Master was lying on a rocking chair, her figure mottled by the shadows of the trees.

As soon as he got home, Li Mo wandered around the Autumn Water Pavilion, occasionally taking out a ruler to measure things.

Ying Bing sat at the tea table and brewed the tea leaves she had brought from the Li Mansion.

Watching Li Mo walk around the courtyard, muttering to himself for a long time, she couldn't help but ask:

"What are you doing?"

"I'm planning to build a hot spring in the yard," Li Mo answered casually.

Ying Bing was stunned.

Tea gushed out from the teacup.

There are only two chapters today, mwah.
