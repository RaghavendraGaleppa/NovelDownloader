Chapter 163: The Madam Imparts the Sword, Aiming to Overturn the Heavens

In the courtyard of the Commandant's Hall, Li Xian held a bowl in his right hand. Inside was plain rice congee with scallions. He slurped a mouthful, the mixture of soup and rice sliding down his throat, quenching his hunger and bringing immense comfort.

With his left hand, he used two fingers like a sword, pointing, jabbing, sweeping, and parrying in the void. The Madam's words echoed in his mind:

"This is the second layer of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword. It is a rare and superior martial art."

"Go and cultivate. If you feel any discomfort, come find me. As long as you are loyal to me, I will support your martial path."

"Since you have begun to practice this sword art, you must come to see me on the fifteenth of every month, at the midnight hour. If you dare to be negligent, consider the consequences."

Li Xian used his fingers as a sword, jabbing, poking, sweeping, and parrying with casual ease. With the foundation of the first layer already laid, the second came naturally, and he successfully mastered the basics.

[You have mastered the cultivation method for the second layer of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword.]

[Proficiency +1]

[Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword · Layer 2]

[Proficiency: 1/800 (Beginner)]

[You may practice the first and second layers together or separately.]

Li Xian possessed the "Heaven's Way Rewards Diligence" destiny. He did not seek shortcuts, but rather steady progress. Practicing separately or together made no difference, so he naturally continued his habit of practicing them individually first, intending to merge them into one only after reaching perfection.

Hot congee was not enough to fill his stomach. Li Xian broke up a steamed bun and mixed it into the congee. In the courtyard, there were also pickled vegetables, salted vegetables, and wine, all gifts from the tenant farmers and guards of the manor.

He mixed the bun into the soup and drank heartily, a burst of various flavors filling his mouth. It had a unique taste.

"I should properly study the art of cooking when I have time in the future."

"A martial artist has a long lifespan. If one only苦練 (bitterly practices) martial arts, wouldn't it be a waste of time? One must also dabble in wine, pleasure, wealth, and qi. Only then is this life not lived in vain. However... one must not become addicted."

Li Xian was enjoying the breeze. The summer heat had receded, and the wind carried a cool fragrance. This was the most comfortable season.

Around this time last year, Li Xian was taking his younger brother into the woods to gather wild fruits. They were sweet and delicious, with a fine taste.

Suddenly, he heard a series of footsteps. It was Ding Hu, running hurriedly. He said a villager was looking for Li Xian, and it seemed to be an urgent matter. Li Xian put down his bowl and chopsticks and went to see him immediately.

The villager said in a panic, "Li... Li Commandant, it's... it's terrible!"

Li Xian said, "What is terrible? Tell me in detail, there is no need to be panicked."

"You... you've been wanted!" The villager was out of breath. After a few moments, he took a sip of water, calmed his breathing, and spoke.

Li Xian was puzzled and asked for the reason. The villager stammered and told him the truth.

He was a tenant farmer of the One Union Manor. The village was close to the county seat, and he often went there. This year, the grains had ripened early, and the harvest was good. After Li Xian reorganized the order, the guards of the One Union Manor and the officials of Qingning County had all behaved themselves.

After paying the taxes, the family had some money left over and wanted to go into the city to buy clothes for the coming autumn and winter. But upon entering the city, he heard a great clamor.

Following the sound, he saw that the Wuxun Hall had been sealed off. All the runners in the hall had their hands and feet broken and were locked in prison carts.

They were being transported to the county prison.

He also saw county runners pasting portraits in the market, taverns, and outside the government hall, loudly proclaiming a bounty for Li Xian.

The farmer was illiterate, but he knew Li Xian had a red mole between his eyebrows. When he saw the wanted portrait, he knew something was wrong and feared it was bad for Li Xian.

He remembered Li Xian's kindness and could not stand by and do nothing. Gritting his teeth and steeling his resolve, he threw all caution to the wind and ran the dozens of miles nonstop.

He had come to deliver the message.

The farmer said, "Commandant Li, those soldiers are fierce! You must flee quickly!"

"Bah! Those corrupt officials and wicked clerks just can't stand to see you do well. They are truly despicable!"

Li Xian patted his shoulder, sending a stream of Qi into his body to calm his breathing. "Alright, I understand. Thank you for the message. Go back now, and on no account tell anyone you've seen me. Their methods are ruthless; I don't want you to be implicated."

Moved by the farmer's righteousness, Li Xian gave him all the silver he had and saw him out of the manor.

Li Xian's face gradually turned cold. This must be the work of the Cao family. He had no intention of sitting and waiting for death. He said, "Ding Hu, disguise yourself now and enter the city to gather information for me!"

Ding Hu had also heard the news and dared not delay. He stepped forward and said, "Yes!" He immediately changed into plain clothes and rode into the city.

Li Xian fetched some rouge and applied it to his face to conceal the red mole between his eyebrows. He then made some other adjustments, turning himself into a coarse, vulgar man.

But the disguise was full of flaws and could be seen through at a glance.

"Forget it. With my disguise skills, it's a fantasy to try and fool people."

He simply smeared his face black all over and set off alone for Qingning.

He saw the city defenses were tight, and all carriages and horses were strictly inspected. His own wanted portrait was being held by the city guards.

The guards were all tall and had unfamiliar faces; they were likely from the provincial capital.

Li Xian thought to himself, "A fine son of the Cao family. His methods are ruthless, and his attacks are like thunder. He is not to be underestimated. He has sealed my Wuxun Hall and issued a bounty for me. His next step... I'm afraid he will try to turn the county's powerful families against me."

"It's too risky to go in now. Let Ding Hu gather the information first, then I will decide."

He calmed his heart and remained composed. With time to spare, he surveyed the surrounding terrain. He saw that four miles east of the city was a wild mountain called "Kanfeng Mountain." The terrain was hidden and excellent for observing the city.

He climbed halfway up the mountain and discovered a stone pavilion with a stream beside it.

Li Xian washed his face with the clear water and sat in the pavilion, gazing at the distant city gate as he quietly waited for Ding Hu's news.

Half a day later, as dusk fell, Ding Hu rode out of the city and headed back to the One Union Manor. On the way, Li Xian called him to stop and come up to Kanfeng Mountain to report the situation.

Li Xian asked, "What is the situation now?"

"Commandant, it's not looking good!" Ding Hu said anxiously, "The County Magistrate claims you colluded with the Old Man of Swallowing Seeds and committed many evil deeds. He is going from house to house, proclaiming your crimes."

"His methods are ruthless. When some citizens spoke up for you, he actually used their children as hostages, forcing the people to curse you!"

"He has also publicly feasted the three halls, two sects, and the great families to win them over and strip you of your power. All the runners of the Wuxun Hall have been arrested. I have a distant relative who works as a guard in the prison."

"I heard from him that those runners are being tortured. The County Magistrate, Cao Kai, wants to beat them into a false confession, forcing them to testify against you, saying you are wicked and tyrannical, preying on the people."

"I don't know... how long they can hold out."

"Commandant, what should we do now? With these charges hanging over you, how can you clear your name? If this continues, the false will become true, and the true will become false. That would be a real disaster!"

Hearing these words, Li Xian was furious. The Cao family's schemes were endless and utterly unscrupulous. But his face remained calm. He said coolly, "It is indeed a thorny problem. When a charge is fabricated, who can argue its innocence? Explanations are useless. There is only one way... blood."

"Commandant, you..." Ding Hu was startled. He thought, "'Blood'—does he mean to fight them head-on? But we are few, they are many. How can we be their match? No matter. What kind of man is the Commandant? He must have a plan to resolve this."

His blood boiled, and he asked firmly, "Commandant, what is the plan? Please give your orders!"

Li Xian said, "A fine Cao family, indeed. Using their power to oppress others, turning falsehood into truth, disregarding human life. If that is the case, then I will... see if they can stand firm!"

"If you are unrighteous, do not blame me for being unloyal!"

He said, "It would be too suspicious if I enter and exit the city frequently. Tomorrow, you will go into the city again and help me call someone out."

Li Xian whispered in his ear, giving him the details. Ding Hu nodded repeatedly, promising to complete the task.

That day, Li Xian contemplated his strategy late into the night. Only when the bright moon was high in the sky did he slowly fall asleep. The breeze blew gently, his hair stirred slightly, and a hidden killing intent was brewing.

A small killing is like thunder; a great killing is silent.

The next day.

Ding Hu disguised himself as a merchant and entered the city. He found Luo Xia and brought her out of the city to meet Li Xian on Kanfeng Mountain.

Luo Xia saw Li Xian and strode over. She teased, "Who would have thought, the great Wuxun Lang, in the blink of an eye, has become a wanted criminal. So, what do you want with me?"

Li Xian smiled. "Sit." He poured her tea.

Luo Xia sat down but did not drink the tea. She looked at Li Xian with curiosity. "You're surprisingly calm. The others are having a hard time, though."

"They are all good brothers. Enduring torture, yet no one has testified against you."

Li Xian said, "Precisely at a time like this, I must be the calmest."

Seeing this demeanor, Ding Hu felt deep admiration from the bottom of his heart. Facing danger without panic, composed and self-possessed. At a time when the situation was collapsing, he was as placid as ever.

Ding Hu thought, "To fight with a man like this is the most terrifying thing. Commandant Li rose from a mere servant to his current high position. It is no accident!"

Luo Xia said seriously, "You called me out to ask for my help, I presume? Let me be clear first: I'm happy to help with small matters. But I won't throw my life away for you."

"That would be even better!" Li Xian said. "But this time... I want to ask you for a great favor."

"I guess you should be willing."

"Oh?" Luo Xia was curious.

Li Xian said, "You once asked me if I was interested in joining the army. I answered that I was not."

"You said that those who enjoy fighting on the battlefield must be fierce and overbearing. I am not that kind of person, but I know that you are."

"Hmph." Luo Xia撇了撇嘴 (curled her lips), but a sharp light flashed in her eyes.

Li Xian said, "To break this situation, I need your help. We will work from within and without, and turn Qingning County upside down. We will burn the county hall to the ground!"

"And cut off the head of the County Magistrate, Cao Kai!"

"You have such nerve!" Luo Xia was shocked. "Your actions are tantamount to rebellion."

"Wrong," Li Xian said. "This is not rebellion. The emperor is far away. If I win, I can say it was the work of bandits. What would be wrong with that?"

"But..."

Luo Xia's heart was already surging. She imagined the county hall ablaze, its fire staining the sky. The hypocrites wailing, the opportunists panicking, the powerful trembling... a magnificent画卷 (scroll). If the officials are not just, why not burn them? Luo Xia thought, "A youth should have such spirit. When faced with injustice, one must immediately draw one's sword!" Her voice rose and fell as she said, "But I am but one person. I cannot do it alone."

"Who said you were alone?" Li Xian smiled. "You must know, we are the legitimate ones!"

He took out the County Magistrate's waist token.

"The County Magistrate's waist token?" Luo Xia took it and confirmed it was real. Her eyes shone. "How did you get this?"

"With this token, you can use the County Magistrate's name to mobilize the county soldiers," Li Xian said. "At that time, I will lead three hundred guards to attack from the outside, and you will have the county soldiers cooperate from within."

"We will make sure Cao Kai's head falls to the ground and the fires of Qingning burn bright!"

"Good!" Luo Xia said. "This plan is feasible. Hahaha, Li Xian, you truly have broadened my horizons. How can there be such a traitor like you in this world!"

Li Xian thought to myself: "Your personality seems to be one that fears the world is not chaotic enough. I, an honest man, was just pushed to the brink and had to bite back."

He said, "By the way, there is one more thing that should be returned to its rightful owner." He took out the fish-scale precious armor.

Luo Xia was stunned, then immediately snatched it, overjoyed. "How did this get into your hands?"

Li Xian said, "To be honest, the two of us have quite a connection. I was the one who bought your precious armor back then."

"So it was you!?" Luo Xia said in surprise. "You were covered in dirt and dust back then, looking utterly pathetic!"

Ding Hu suddenly said, "Commandant, look quickly." He pointed towards the city wall.

They saw Cao Kai hanging a corpse on the city wall. The corpse had been stripped naked, and words were carved into its flesh with a knife: "Evil Commandant, Show Yourself."

This corpse was a runner from the Wuxun Hall named Fang Er. He had been unable to withstand the torture and was killed to warn the others. Even in death, he was humiliated.

He was hung on the city wall to force Li Xian to show himself.

Cao Kai's voice rang out loud and clear: "Evil Commandant Li Xian, I want to see how long you can hide!"

Li Xian said coldly, "I will give you one night to plan. Tomorrow, the plan begins. We will break through the East Gate! And take Cao Kai's dog head!"

"Good!" Luo Xia picked up her teacup, drank the tea as if it were wine, then smashed the cup to pieces. She said sharply, "Why wait for a night? We can do it anytime. I will follow your lead. When do we start?"

"If that is the case..." Li Xian slowly rose to his feet. He used the tea as a substitute for wine, pointed his sword towards Qingning, and proclaimed in a clear, loud voice:

"At the chen hour tomorrow, in the bright light of day, the heavens will be overturned and the earth shaken!"

Luo Xia had been on the battlefield for a long time, fighting enemies and hearing countless inspiring speeches, most of which used profit as a lure. But at this moment, the simple twelve words made her scalp tingle.

In the bright light of day, my heart is without shame.
To overturn the heavens and shake the earth, my momentum is like a flood.
