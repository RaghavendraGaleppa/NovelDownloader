# Chapter 31: One Punch Kills a Ninth-Rank Late-Stage Exotic Beast, And You Call Yourself a Swordsman?

At the same time, in the mountain forest.

"A ninth-rank early-stage exotic beast can't even scratch my skin." Li Mo glanced at his fist.

They say to strike a snake at its seven-inch mark. But he had just intentionally tested the limits of his physical body. The result was that without even using qi and blood energy, he shattered the small-winged python with a single punch.

It was strange. Li Mo had never even killed a chicken before. Yet, during his first kill of an exotic beast, he felt no tension or discomfort whatsoever. When he threw the punch, his heart was calm, as if he had countless similar experiences.

"Is this also a benefit of the Xuanpin Immortal Physique?" Li Mo couldn't help but inwardly scoff. It seemed he was incredibly quick to pick up anything, except for sword practice.

Shaking the blood from his fist, "Wangyue Cliff..." Li Mo checked the map. Then he drew his Azuresteel Sword and headed deeper into the forest.

In the vast, dense forest, occasional shouts could be heard. From time to time, newly admitted disciples could be seen battling exotic beasts.

Li Mo did not stop. Along the way, he encountered several more ninth-rank early-stage exotic beasts, but their fates were the same as the winged snake before. All were instantly killed with a single sword stroke; Li Mo didn't even use any sword techniques.

Soon, he arrived at the area marked 'Stream Stone Forest' on the map. Strange-shaped stone pillars stood like withered trees without branches, and a river over ten meters wide flowed through the middle.

"This river flows down from Wangyue Cliff," he mused. "I just need to go upstream."

Footsteps approached from ahead. He looked up and saw an Inner Sect Deacon returning, dragging a scaly, black-horned, sheep-like exotic beast.

An old friend. The Black-Horned Sheep. Although it often appeared on the dining tables of Autumn Water Pavilion, it was actually a ninth-rank late-stage exotic beast. Though herbivorous, its nature was exceptionally combative, and its strength was remarkably great. Yet now it had been slain by a single sword.

"Killed by Ying Bing?" Li Mo recognized it immediately. A clean, decisive sword strike to the throat, the wound frozen so not a single drop of blood flowed out. The Black-Horned Sheep probably didn't even know it was dying before it succumbed.

"Indeed, it's True Disciple Ying's work," the deacon nodded. He stood rooted, simply watching Li Mo, no longer moving.

Li Mo was initially puzzled, then his brow relaxed. He sensed it too.

The next moment, suddenly, a colossal black shadow emerged from the water and leaped high. It was a massive turtle with an uneven, spiky shell on its back! A ninth-rank late-stage exotic beast, the Spiked-Back Tortoise. Its blood could be used in medicine, its meat was extremely delicious, and even its shell was valuable—the bathtubs in Autumn Water Pavilion were made from it... Of course, as a ninth-rank late-stage exotic beast, the Spiked-Back Tortoise was also extremely ferocious. In any body of water it inhabited, there were usually no other fish.

"Another ninth-rank late-stage exotic beast," the Inner Sect Deacon commented, watching with interest. Both these true disciples had entered Clear Abyss Sect at the same time and had both ascended a hundred steps on the Heaven-Ascending Staircase. True Disciple Ying could instantly kill a Black-Horned Sheep with a single sword. He wondered how True Disciple Li would fare against the Spiked-Back Tortoise. Of course, both were ninth-rank late-stage exotic beasts, but the Spiked-Back Tortoise would undoubtedly be harder to kill. If it retracted all its limbs into its shell, a Qi-Blood realm martial artist would likely be left staring helplessly.

Just as he was thinking this, Li Mo on the opposite side moved. The Azuresteel Sword suddenly burst forth with dozens of sword lights, each imbued with restrained qi and blood energy.

"Impressive swordsmanship," the Inner Sect Deacon couldn't help but exclaim with a hint of admiration. Even among the true disciples throughout Clear Abyss Sect's history, this sword technique could be considered astonishing. Had he not witnessed Ying Bing's sword technique earlier, he might have been even more surprised.

Sensing danger, the Spiked-Back Tortoise opposite let out a low growl and immediately retracted its limbs. Dozens of feather-like marks, formed by the "Fire Crane Thousand Feathers" technique, erupted on the tortoise shell, instantly riddling it with tiny chips and cracks.

Not only was the tortoise shell chipped, but the Azuresteel Sword also had several rice-grain-sized nicks.

Li Mo: "..."

This sword was a standard weapon issued by the sect, and it should have been perfectly adequate for slaying ninth-rank exotic beasts. Unfortunately, he had encountered a tough nut, an "iron tortoise." If he had used a bit more force just now, the sword might have broken before the shell did.

"Roar..." The Spiked-Back Tortoise seemed to have chickened out, flipping over and fleeing back into the water.

"Don't run!" Li Mo pursued it without hesitation.
