# Chapter 36: The Solitary Peak of Ten Thousand Caves

Gu Yuan narrowed his eyes, feeling inexplicably puzzled.

When he first stepped onto the Dragon Tooth Treasure Ship, this person had appeared indifferent. Yet in the blink of an eye, they now regarded him with such hostility—as if they wished to eliminate him at all costs. The strangest part was that Gu Yuan didn't even know who this person was.

Meanwhile, the tall and lean Senior Brother Yang, upon hearing the words "solve the mystery of her death," suddenly looked enlightened. Noticing Gu Yuan's confusion, he couldn't help but shake his head with a bitter smile and sent a voice transmission:

"Senior Brother Gu, please don't take offense."

"Senior Brother Kuang Mingsheng's father was once a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator. However, lacking the spiritual materials needed for Foundation Establishment, he remained stuck at that stage. Coincidentally, Elder Hu issued a bounty—anyone who could uncover the truth behind the death of his disciple, Yu Linglong, would receive a promise from a Golden Core elder."

"Brother Kuang's father sought to use this bounty to exchange for Foundation Establishment materials, so he left the sect to search for clues. Unfortunately, he encountered a demonic beast and perished."

"Brother Kuang has held onto this resentment ever since. Now that he knows you joined the sect because of this matter, he harbors some bitterness. Please don't take it to heart, Senior Brother Gu."

As Yang Yue explained with a wry smile, he inwardly regretted his actions. He had initially thought Gu Yuan had some connection with the Golden Core elder and wanted to forge a friendship to gain more benefits in the Shell Field. But it turned out Gu Yuan had only entered the sect because of that bounty—no wonder he had remained in the Hidden Dragon Academy for months without leaving.

Not only had Yang Yue failed to establish a useful connection, but he had also offended Senior Brother Kuang. What a waste.

With a sigh, he shook his head.

Kuang Mingsheng, meanwhile, glared at Gu Yuan with deep resentment. A lucky brat from a ruined minor sect had somehow solved the mystery and claimed the bounty, while his own father had died in the attempt, leaving the Kuang family in decline for over a decade. He didn't dare direct his anger at the Golden Core elder, so he vented it all on Gu Yuan.

"Senior Brother Yang, if you still wish to travel with us, I suggest you keep your distance from this man!" 

Though burning with hatred, Kuang Mingsheng dared not act openly within the academy's territory. He could only coldly warn Yang Yue.

The other young cultivators behind Kuang Mingsheng also turned their gazes toward Gu Yuan. Though Kuang Mingsheng's father had perished, he had been a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator, leaving behind some resources. As a result, Kuang Mingsheng had cultivated smoothly and established himself as a minor figure in the Hidden Dragon Academy, with his own circle of followers. 

For this expedition to the Cloud Cliff Shell Field, the three fifth-level Qi Refining cultivators were led by Kuang Mingsheng. His words carried weight, and the others quickly aligned themselves with him.

"I was merely greeting him!" 

Yang Yue chuckled awkwardly, then shot Gu Yuan an apologetic glance before stepping behind Kuang Mingsheng. 

Had Gu Yuan truly enjoyed special favor from the Golden Core elder, Yang Yue would have sided with him. But since Gu Yuan was merely a bounty claimant, his value paled in comparison to Kuang Mingsheng's. 

Golden Core elders frequently issued bounties, rewarding those who completed them—this was standard practice. The academy saw such things often. After all, elders were busy with cultivation and preferred to delegate trivial matters. 

But expecting to forge a lasting connection from such a transaction was foolish. 

A hired hand was just that—once the job was done, the relationship ended. Did a courier expect gratitude from the one who paid them?

"I only regret not investigating this man's background properly. What a farce!" 

Resentful, Yang Yue stopped engaging with Gu Yuan.

Watching their performance, Gu Yuan finally understood the situation. 

He merely shook his head slightly. 

Who would have thought that after constantly leveraging the Golden Core elder's reputation for benefits, he would now gain an enemy because of it? 

Opportunity truly was a double-edged sword.

Meeting Kuang Mingsheng's icy stare, Gu Yuan felt no fear—only a faint amusement. 

"Perhaps this man can be of use to me."

With that thought, his lips curled slightly, and he silently mouthed two words at Kuang Mingsheng. 

Though Kuang Mingsheng didn't understand the words, Gu Yuan's expression made their meaning clear. His face darkened further.

"Gather spiritual energy!" 

"Set sail!" 

Just then, a young attendant below the Dragon Tooth Treasure Ship shouted loudly. 

The Artisan Pavilion's outer disciples activated the formation disks, summoning intricate patterns of light. An invisible force surged beneath the ship, lifting it like water currents until it hovered in the air. 

"Boom!" 

"Boom!" 

"Boom!" 

Three drumbeats resounded as nine treasure ships sailed out of the mountain gates. 

Once they had departed, an even more magnificent vessel—adorned with jewels and encircled by starlight—followed leisurely, heading toward the Scarlet Moon Great River.

---

Mountains coiled like slumbering dragons, their towering peaks piercing the clouds. 

Amid the lush, ancient trees, countless creatures played and fought, their roars echoing through the wilderness. 

At the heart of the mountain range, an immense river surged endlessly, its thunderous currents churning up waves like rolling snow. 

The river flowed through the mountains before merging into a vast marsh. 

But just as the waters should have spread unimpeded, a solitary peak abruptly rose at the junction of the river and marsh, blocking the way.

This was a strange, pagoda-like mountain. 

The raging waters had submerged half of it. 

Upon closer inspection, the peak revealed its mystical nature—divided into nine tiers, each coiled like a dragon, its surface riddled with countless caves. 

Water poured endlessly into these caves, only to surge back out, eternally reshaping the land. 

The upper four tiers remained above water, occasionally splashed by waves, while the fifth tier and below gradually disappeared beneath the surface. 

Just then, the sky echoed with drumbeats as the nine treasure ships crossed the marsh and descended upon the solitary peak.

"We're here!" 

"This is the Cloud Cliff Shell Field!" 

"The Cloud Cliff Mountain resembles a nine-tiered pagoda, nourished by water veins. Each tier is a natural shell field, shaped by the heavens. The Emerald Fire Golden-Eyed Apes have occupied this place for a thousand years—who knows how many demonic creatures they've bred?"

Someone on Gu Yuan's ship marveled at the sight. 

Gu Yuan, too, was awed. 

A solitary peak with nine tiers and countless caves, ceaselessly carved by water veins—such a spectacle could only exist in the world of cultivation.

"The Cloud Cliff Shell Field awaits. Do not disgrace our academy's name!" 

"Go forth!" 

A commanding voice boomed from one of the ships, and immediately, countless streaks of light shot out as cultivators leaped from the vessels. 

From the first ship, nervous new disciples wobbled on their magical tools as they carefully landed on the first tier, their faces lighting up at the sight of tiny frogs that could only spit water arrows. 

From the ninth ship, streaks of light shot like rainbows straight into the submerged ninth-tier caves, parting the water veins in search of the Shell Kings that could aid in Foundation Establishment. 

Each cultivator, according to their strength, sought their fortune across the nine-tiered shell field. 

There was no better trial ground than this. 

From the fifth ship, Kuang Mingsheng shot Gu Yuan a cold smirk before leading his four companions down to the fifth tier. They swiftly vanished into one of the caves. 

But Gu Yuan's thoughts were no longer on him. 

His gaze lingered on the deepest caves, buried under thick layers of water veins, and a deep helplessness flashed across his face. 

Only when he shifted his focus to the shallower caves did his expression ease slightly. 

After a brief moment of contemplation, Gu Yuan wasted no more time. 

Summoning his Cloud-Treading Shuttle, he descended toward the solitary peak and casually selected a cave entrance, stepping into the fifth tier of the Cloud Cliff Shell Field.
