# Chapter 8: The Cave Abode

"Disciple Gu Yuan of the newly admitted class, paying respects to the Patriarch!"

At the center of the vast bronze hall hung an enormous portrait.

The painting depicted an ordinary-looking elder dressed in purple Daoist robes. Though unremarkable in appearance, his eyes were profoundly deep, as if flowing with galaxies of stars.

This was the portrait of the founding patriarch of Qingfeng Daoist Academy.

The patriarch had long since wandered the world and disappeared—whether perished or simply missing, he hadn't been seen for thousands of years.

As Gu Yuan knelt before the portrait, the eyes in the painting seemed to come alive, gazing down at him.

A power far surpassing that of a Golden Core master swept over Gu Yuan. Whether it was his imagination or not, he felt the patriarch in the portrait give him a slight nod.

"The Patriarch has acknowledged you. The ceremony is complete!"

Elder Qiu Mingshan's voice confirmed it wasn't just his imagination.

"Junior Brother Gu, rise quickly. From today onward, you are officially a disciple of Qingfeng Daoist Academy!"

Qiu Mingshan stood to the side, smiling as he called out to Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan stood up, bowed respectfully to the patriarch's portrait once more, then followed Qiu Mingshan out of the great hall.

Once outside, Gu Yuan asked, "Elder Brother Qiu, about that portrait just now—"

"Haha, I knew you'd ask about that," Qiu Mingshan chuckled. "But the patriarch's realm is beyond our comprehension. Just know that the portrait contains a wisp of the patriarch's power. Anyone hiding their true form or harboring ill intent would be discovered by it and executed on the spot."

"This is the final checkpoint for admission! Even if you were recommended by a Golden Core master, this step must be taken."

Gu Yuan nodded in understanding.

Under Qiu Mingshan's guidance, Gu Yuan registered in the academy's jade records and began receiving cultivation resources.

The main event he had been anticipating had finally arrived.

"Wealth, companionship, methods, and land—the four essentials of cultivation. Let's address them one by one."

"First, 'wealth.' Typically, newly admitted disciples below the fifth level of Qi Refinement receive one set of lower-grade magical robes engraved with water-and-fire resistance and dust-repelling arrays. But since you're already at the fourth level and will soon reach the fifth, you qualify for mid-grade robes with three arrays: water-and-fire resistance, dust-repelling, and a minor spirit-gathering array that boosts cultivation by half a percent. Let's say... five sets."

"New disciples receive three Qi Gathering Pills per month. To save you the trouble of coming back each month, I'll issue you a year's supply upfront—thirty-six pills in total."

"You'll need magical tools, all mid-grade: a Cloud-Treading Shuttle, a Small Green Spirit Sword, and a Black Tortoise Shield."

"New disciples also receive five spirit stones as a congratulatory gift. Since you've traveled thousands of miles to join us, let's make it ten!"

"That should cover it. Oh, you'll need a storage pouch for all these items—let's make it three zhang in size so you won't need to replace it later."

With a sweep of his sleeve, Qiu Mingshan handed over the various items to Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan quickly accepted them, his face lighting up with joy.

Good heavens—receiving a year's salary in advance upon joining, with all benefits upgraded a tier. This was the privilege of being recommended by a Golden Core master—truly impressive.

Qiu Mingshan continued, "As for 'companionship,' teachers count as companions. But since you haven't been taken in by a Golden Core master and were previously a disciple of another sect, arrangements might take time. For now, you have two options."

"First, I can record your name in the jade registry. If any Golden Core master or Foundation Establishment elder wishes to take you as a disciple, they'll contact you."

"Second, you can directly join the Hidden Dragon Academy. It's for disciples without masters, but that doesn't mean you won't receive guidance. Periodically, Foundation Establishment elders and even Golden Core masters give lectures there, open to all disciples."

"Additionally, you can spend spirit stones to seek private guidance. As fellow disciples, the fees aren't too steep."

Qiu Mingshan added, "To be honest, apart from the core disciples of the seven lineages and some aristocratic family members, most academy disciples start in the Hidden Dragon Academy. I myself spent several years there before being fortunate enough to be taken in by my master."

His tone was unhurried as he explained the academy's structure.

Qiu Mingshan's words made everything clear to Gu Yuan.

"Joining the Hidden Dragon Academy is just a temporary measure. Since Elder Hu recommended you, you'll likely have another chance to become his disciple in the future. For now, it's best to bide your time."

Seeing that the matter was settled, Gu Yuan clasped his hands and said, "I'll follow your guidance, Elder Brother!"

"Good. Then let's head to the Hidden Dragon Academy first."

"With the second matter resolved, we move to 'methods.'"

"Cultivation is impossible without proper methods—this is paramount!"

"Especially for you, the first step to integrating into the academy is replacing your current cultivation techniques with our academy's supreme arts."

"The academy possesses three scriptures and seven diagrams. The three scriptures are profound beyond measure—only Golden Core cultivators may study them. The seven diagrams all lead to the Great Dao of the Golden Core, but four are exclusive to the seven lineages and only taught to true disciples."

"The Hidden Dragon Academy offers only three: the Toad Moon Divine Light Diagram, the Seed of Heaven and Earth Evergreen Diagram, and the Five Elements True Wheel Diagram."

"Later, I'll take you to the Hidden Dragon Academy's scripture hall, where you can choose the one that suits you best."

"Thank you, Elder Brother!"

"No need for thanks." Qiu Mingshan waved his hand with a smile. "Wealth, companionship, and methods are all accounted for. That leaves your cultivation site—your cave abode."

"Speaking of which, your timing is excellent. Normally, I wouldn't be able to help much with this, but right now, there might be a small opportunity for you."

"If luck is on your side, you could gain some resources or even an inheritance."

"Though it's only a Qi Refinement-level inheritance, it would still be a significant boon for you."

Intrigued, Gu Yuan asked, "What kind of opportunity is this? Please enlighten me, Elder Brother!"

Qiu Mingshan didn't hold back. "You should know that in our path of cultivation, secluding oneself is futile. We must venture out to seek experiences and enlightenment."

"But with adventure comes risk."

"Ordinary Qi Refinement disciples don't have life-lamps in the academy. Some leave and don't return for ten or even several decades—whether dead or missing, their cave abodes remain empty, wasting resources."

"So the academy has a rule: For those below the fifth level of Qi Refinement, cave abodes are reserved for fifteen years; for those above, thirty years."

"If a disciple hasn't returned or sent any messages within that time and has no known relatives, the cave abode is reclaimed."

"Since these are Qi Refinement disciples, their abodes are usually simple with few treasures. The academy doesn't bother cleaning them out—for two spirit stones, you can inherit the abode and everything inside."

"To the academy, the items inside are trivial, but for a Qi Refinement disciple, there's a chance to stumble upon something valuable. Even a few extra spirit stones would be a boon."

"In half a month, a batch of cave abodes will expire. A few have excellent spiritual energy, and their previous owners left decent legacies. I can arrange for you to have first pick. But the contents are private—I don't know what's inside. Whether you find treasure depends on your luck."

This was essentially a blind box!

Gu Yuan's eyes lit up.

For most people, opening a blind box was purely a matter of luck.

But in half a month, the jade liquid in his stone vial would have accumulated enough.

With the ability to see opportunities, he could pick the best one at will.

"Thank you, Elder Brother Qiu!"

Gu Yuan bowed sincerely.

"Haha, no need for thanks. This is all up to chance. You might be thrilled only to find the cave in complete disarray."

Qiu Mingshan waved his hand.

This matter depended entirely on fortune. He was merely facilitating things and didn't want to take undue credit.

"Let's go. The cave abode matter can wait half a month. First, I'll take you to the Hidden Dragon Academy to find lodging, receive your cultivation methods, and get settled."
