# Chapter 13: Qi Condensation Pill, Budding Ambitions

"How much is this 'Blue Lizard Demon' worth?"

The next day, at his private mountain peak, Qi Baicang inquired of a mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator from the Qi family standing before him.

This mid-stage cultivator was from the main peak's treasure vault.

After deciding to sell the beast to the family, to prevent the demon beast meat from spoiling, Qi Chuan had gone directly to the main peak's treasure vault to report that he had obtained a demon beast corpse.

He claimed it was an invading demon beast accidentally killed by his second uncle.

Upon hearing this, the treasure vault personnel were surprised but readily agreed, quickly sending someone to inspect it.

"It's indeed a first-grade lower-tier Blue Lizard Demon. While the beast's blood and materials aren't particularly valuable, its meat is quite useful for extracting essences for alchemy. This adult Blue Lizard Demon is also larger than average..."

"Let's make it a fair price—twenty-two low-grade spirit stones. How does that sound?"

After some thought, the middle-aged cultivator smiled at Qi Baicang.

Being fellow Qi family members, cheating was rare. Twenty-two low-grade spirit stones was indeed a fair price, especially since the Blue Lizard Demon was relatively uncommon among first-grade lower-tier demon beasts and held decent value.

For ordinary first-grade lower-tier demon beasts, the price would be much lower.

Qi Baicang exchanged a glance with Qi Chuan, silently agreeing the price was reasonable, and nodded to finalize the transaction.

Soon, the middle-aged cultivator had the Blue Lizard Demon's corpse taken away, carefully collecting the blue-green beast blood in jade bottles without waste.

In Qi Chuan's hands now rested twenty-two low-grade spirit stones.

With these, he could purchase pills to enhance his cultivation.

After consulting his second uncle, Qi Chuan headed straight for the exchange pavilion on the main peak.

The exchange pavilion was where the Qi family provided resources to its cultivators, typically exchanged for spirit stones or contribution points.

However, the pavilion didn't store the items; it only provided a list. Once a family member confirmed their exchange and paid the spirit stones or deducted contribution points, the items would be retrieved from the treasure vault.

Soon, Qi Chuan arrived at the exchange pavilion and met with an elder there.

This elder, overseeing the exchange pavilion, clearly held considerable authority.

"You're Qi Chuan, right? What would you like to exchange?" The elder handed back Qi Chuan's family token with a smile.

"Pills—cultivation-enhancing pills," Qi Chuan answered without hesitation.

The elder showed no surprise at this common request and produced a paper listing various pills along with their exchange prices.

"Qi Condensation Pill... three spirit stones per pill. Effects: accelerates cultivation speed for early to mid Qi Condensation stages, though effectiveness diminishes in mid-stage and becomes useless in late-stage."

"Solid Qi Pill... two spirit stones per pill, slightly less effective than Qi Condensation Pill..."

"Then there's Refining Spirit Pill, quite effective even in mid Qi Condensation stage, but much more expensive..."

After reviewing the list, Qi Chuan found few suitable options. While many types of pills were listed, most served other purposes, with only a small portion enhancing cultivation.

Among those, even fewer were affordable and suitable for early Qi Condensation stage.

After some deliberation, Qi Chuan decided, "I'll take the Qi Condensation Pills—eight of them."

He placed twenty-four low-grade spirit stones before the elder.

"Quite the fortune for someone so young," the elder remarked with mild surprise. Most youths Qi Chuan's age would be lucky to have a few spirit stones. Without further comment, he processed the exchange.

Soon, Qi Chuan received a jade bottle containing eight Qi Condensation Pills.

"A whole demon beast corpse plus two extra spirit stones just for eight Qi Condensation Pills. Alchemists make a killing. I must learn alchemy if I get the chance!" Qi Chuan mused.

And this was the family's fair price. In the outside world's markets, trading a Blue Lizard Demon corpse for eight Qi Condensation Pills would be impossible.

Shaking his head, Qi Chuan left the pavilion.

"Did you hear? In three years, the Breeze Moon Sect will open its gates for disciple recruitment..."

"What? Really?"

Just as he stepped out, two young cultivators passed by, deep in conversation.

Catching their words, Qi Chuan slowed his steps but continued forward.

As they passed, their voices carried on.

"How could it be false? A friend of mine, a descendant of an elder, told me. The news will spread soon."

"Ah, the Breeze Moon Sect... Even becoming an outer disciple would be great. But we're over twenty—too old now, right?"

Leaving the main peak for his private mountain, Qi Chuan pondered what he'd heard.

"One thing after another."

"Before the fifty-li forbidden zone's secret realm is settled, now the Breeze Moon Sect's recruitment?"

He recalled his second uncle's past mention of the Sword Dao and Swordmaster Xuanjian.

"Joining the Breeze Moon Sect doesn't guarantee access to the Sword Dao, but staying out certainly won't."

"Even as an outer disciple, the sect's resources could accelerate my cultivation."

"With three years to prepare, I might have a real chance..."

Back at his peak, he consulted his second uncle.

"Breeze Moon Sect recruitment in three years? I hadn't heard, but it's plausible."

Qi Baicang explained, "Normally, they recruit mortal children with spiritual roots from their vast territories annually. But periodically, they also open their gates to family cultivators and wandering cultivators."

"The last such recruitment was twenty years ago. This interval is shorter, but possible."

Smiling, he added, "This could be your chance to join the sect and pursue Swordmaster Xuanjian's legacy. At your current second-layer Qi Condensation, three years of effort could make you a viable outer disciple candidate."

Remembering Qi Chuan's past jest about this, they shared a laugh.

Returning to his room, Qi Chuan grew pensive, ambition stirring.

Previously, without a path forward, it was mere fantasy. Now, with this opportunity, why not try?

Though the sect's standards and his family's stance remained unclear, advancing his cultivation was undoubtedly beneficial.

Perhaps... a small goal.

Reaching mid-stage Qi Condensation within three years?

With this resolve, Qi Chuan retrieved the jade bottle, uncorked it, and poured out a Qi Condensation Pill.

The pill was perfectly round, dark green, exuding a fragrant aroma that stirred his internal energy upon inhalation.

After a brief inspection, he swallowed it without hesitation.
