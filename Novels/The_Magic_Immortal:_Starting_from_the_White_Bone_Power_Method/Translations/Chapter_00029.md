# Chapter 29: Divine Ability — Dragon's Vigor and Tiger's Might  

Feeling the fifteen strands of pure and condensed mana swirling in his dantian, Wang Chan couldn't resist flipping his palm, allowing a wisp of grayish-white mana to slither like a tiny serpent between his fingers—utterly charming.  

Compared to his previous Xuan Turtle mana, the Bone mana he now wielded was far superior in both aura and density, weighing heavily in his hand.  

The Xuan Turtle mana had been a dual-elemental water and earth type, while the Bone mana was purely of the yin attribute. Circulating it through his body brought immense comfort, nourishing both body and mind. Paired with his refined appearance, his entire demeanor seemed to have elevated another notch.  

Not that demeanor mattered much—he simply liked it.  

But when he immersed his consciousness into his True Bone, he saw fifteen pitch-black strands of True Force coursing through his skeletal structure like dark serpents.  

At that moment, he felt as though his entire skeleton had turned into tempered steel, brimming with boundless strength—enough to punch a wild ox to death with a single strike.  

Yet, the moment he touched that True Force, his emotions grew restless. The violent energy stirred an impulse within him to destroy everything in sight.  

Moreover, once his body was enveloped by the True Force, his appearance underwent a drastic transformation—from a refined cultivator to a towering, pitch-black skeletal figure.  

This True Force was the epitome of yin and malevolence. Once unleashed, its sinister aura surged overwhelmingly. Powerful, yes—but terrifyingly grotesque.  

After a brief contact, Wang Chan withdrew his consciousness, retracting the True Bone manifestation. His blood and qi surged as his mana cloaked his body, ensuring not a trace of the sinister energy leaked out.  

"Unless absolutely necessary, I must never reveal the True Bone form."  

Wang Chan reminded himself sternly. The moment someone discovered his demonic roots, he’d be hunted down as a heretic.  

Of course, in dire situations, the True Bone form could serve as a life-saving trump card.  

For instance, in a battle where his mana was exhausted and he seemed defenseless, he could suddenly activate the True Bone form when his opponent least expected it, catching them off guard. The thought alone was thrilling.  

However, speaking of consumption, Wang Chan was surprised.  

He had assumed that after switching cultivation methods, his original twenty-four strands of ungraded mana would at best convert into eight graded strands of Bone mana.  

Yet, whether due to the panel’s mysterious capabilities, the immense power contained within the high-grade demonic bone of the Tiger Python, or the profound nature of the *Bone Devouring Strength Technique*, he now possessed a staggering fifteen strands of Bone mana.  

That was equivalent to forty-five strands of Xuan Turtle mana!  

Even more astonishing was the fact that he also had fifteen strands of True Bone Force.  

This meant that with his current mana reserves, he could consecutively cast the Black Needle or White Needle techniques five times.  

As for the Silver Needle, he could cast it fifteen times in a row. The *Nine Needles Sealing Technique* would no longer be an issue.  

This drastically improved his combat endurance and the frequency with which he could unleash killing moves, significantly boosting his overall fighting prowess.  

The thought made his fingers itch. He yearned to summon the Black and White Needles right then and there, eager to test the might of his Bone mana.  

And then there was the True Bone form—brutal and domineering. A true man should fight with fists meeting flesh!  

"I wonder if, with the True Bone form and the **[Dragon’s Vigor and Tiger’s Might]**, I could take down a Qi Refining cultivator with a single punch!"  

The thought of his newly acquired divine ability made his heart race even more.  

Yet, this ability, obtained by fusing with a high-grade demonic bone, was only mid-tier—a fact that left him deeply disappointed.  

If only it had been a high-tier ability! Once fully engraved with divine patterns and refined, it could have evolved into a supreme-tier ability.  

At that point, if not invincible among Qi Refining cultivators, he could at least roam unhindered.  

Especially since this ability was straightforward and ferocious—when activated, it temporarily enhanced his physique, defense, and speed to match that of a mid-tier demonic beast or a mid-tier magical artifact.  

Aside from spiritual resistance, this ability had almost no weaknesses.  

A rare and formidable divine ability indeed.  

Alas, his own innate aptitude was too low, dragging down the potential of the high-grade demonic bone fusion and resulting in only a mid-tier ability.  

There was nothing he could do about it. He could only console himself—having a mid-tier ability was still good. With further refinement, it could still reach high-tier, providing ample protection in the future.  

One mustn’t aim too high too fast. Steady progress ensures longevity.  

Moreover, unlike spells, divine abilities could evolve in rank as one’s cultivation realm advanced, remaining useful for life.  

How many people longed for divine abilities in vain? To have obtained a mid-tier ability for protection—what more could he ask for?  

Spell cultivation involved refining spell seals, using mana to activate them and resonate with the power of heaven and earth, unleashing various effects. In a way, spells sought power externally.  

Divine abilities, however, were innate.  

Generally, orthodox graded cultivation techniques, when mastered to perfection and harmonized with one’s body, could give rise to innate talents—also known as innate divine abilities.  

Next were those with special physiques—spiritual bodies, dharma bodies, treasure bodies, or even legendary dao bodies—who might awaken divine abilities as they cultivated.  

Then came demonic cultivators, who fused with demonic bones, ghostly energy, demonic blood, or other exotic substances, also with a chance of birthing divine abilities.  

Divine abilities refined divine patterns, absorbing external forces to transform and grow—a process of internal seeking.  

Additionally, unorthodox cultivators’ symbiotic companions or miscellaneous cultivators’ bonded artifacts might also contain divine abilities. Though not self-generated, they could still be borrowed.  

Wang Chan took several deep breaths to calm his excitement, suppressing the urge to test his abilities immediately. He decided to wait for another day, heading to a deserted wilderness to experiment.  

This place was too crowded, especially with a late-stage Qi Refining expert living next door. It wasn’t the time for recklessness.  

Soon, the skewers sizzled on the fire, releasing an enticing aroma. Wang Chan rolled up his sleeves and dug in heartily.  

After a while, sweat beaded on his forehead as he devoured the food. Staring at the remaining skewers, he suddenly frowned.  

Perhaps due to his dual cultivation of body and mana, his appetite seemed to have grown significantly. Despite roasting so much meat and vegetables, he wasn’t even half-full.  

Even if he finished everything in front of him, he’d only be about sixty percent satiated.  

Fortunately, buried beneath the fire was a beggar’s chicken, now perfectly cooked. Wondering how the spiritual chicken of this world compared to the poultry of his past life, Wang Chan took a big gulp of fruit juice and eagerly dug it out.  

In no time, he retrieved a clay ball from the pit, cracked it open, and carefully peeled back the withered leaves. An indescribable fragrance wafted into his nostrils, and his mouth watered uncontrollably.  

Just as he was about to tear off a drumstick and take a bite, a chilling breeze swept past, making him shiver. Instinctively, he sensed something amiss.  

He snapped his head up—only to see Daoist Chen standing atop the courtyard wall, her silver high ponytail swaying playfully in the moonlight like a mischievous girl.  

When had she arrived?  

Wang Chan’s heart tightened. Instinctively, he suppressed the True Force within his bones even deeper, layering his fleshly power and pure mana as additional concealment, fearing she might see through his true nature.  

After all, she was a late-stage Qi Refining expert—someone who had nearly slain a formidable Tiger Python. Mysterious and powerful, she was not to be underestimated.  

At the same time, he quickly reviewed his recent actions, ensuring he hadn’t inadvertently leaked any traces of his sinister True Force.  

Fortunately, he hadn’t.  

Still, he didn’t dare relax. His mana surged within him, his body tensed, and his mind simultaneously connected with the Silver Needle and the divine patterns inside him.  

Strangely, perhaps due to nervousness, a dangerous impulse flickered in the depths of his heart—an urge to leap onto the wall, grab Daoist Chen’s ponytail, and… *teach her a lesson*.  

*Am I out of my mind? Where did that thought come from?*  

Thankfully, Wang Chan quickly regained his composure, suppressing the impulse. But a new question arose—  

What was she doing on his wall in the middle of the night?
