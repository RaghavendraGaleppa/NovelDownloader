Chapter 60: Feet or Mouth?

No cultivator who becomes a Spirit Farmer wants to lose this identity. Therefore, they all have to stay extremely vigilant to maintain it. Ding Rui naturally had to do the same!

After discussing matters concerning Spirit Farmers, Liu Yun also spoke to Ding Rui about cultivation after being a Spirit Farmer, a topic that Shui Yu had mentioned before. Liu Yun similarly advised Ding Rui that when he decides to leave the spirit fields and stop being a Spirit Farmer, he should choose to abandon a few cultivation techniques. This would allow him to cultivate more smoothly and safely. Liu Yun himself had made the same decision.

At this time, Liu Yun had already reached the peak of Qi Refinement First Level, but in order to stay in the spirit fields longer, he chose not to break through further. After all, a cultivation base at Qi Refinement First Level was entirely sufficient in the spirit fields. Most Spirit Farmers were like this. The advancement of cultivation and the demands of spirit field work were destined to be mutually exclusive. However, with the resources accumulated while being a Spirit Farmer, when a Spirit Farmer no longer wished to remain in the spirit fields, they could quickly elevate their cultivation. After all, the biggest factor affecting a cultivator's speed of cultivation was the limitation of resources.

However, regarding the matter of whether to abandon cultivation techniques, despite receiving advice from two senior brothers, Ding Rui still decided to try using his skill slots. He wanted to see if he could manage to cultivate all five techniques simultaneously to Qi Refinement Second Level, Third Level, or even Foundation Establishment, without abandoning any of them!

Ding Rui felt that his future days might not be easy. Especially during this initial period as a Spirit Farmer. Even with his skill slots, he still had to be extremely careful. He certainly didn't want to end up like Liu Yun said: spending immense effort and energy to cultivate five techniques, even providing benefits to all cultivators in the spirit fields for nearly a year, only to lose his Spirit Farmer identity due to a moment of carelessness. That would be far too great a loss. At the very least, he had to treat this first harvest with absolute seriousness.

However, Ding Rui was still very confident in himself. After adapting for a while, he should be able to get accustomed to the life and work of a Spirit Farmer. After all, practice makes perfect. And although his skill slots were currently full, there was still room for improvement. Whether it was work skills or cultivation skills, he could quickly merge them together. Once he freed up more skill slots, he would undoubtedly be even more at ease with the work in the spirit fields!

The next day, Ding Rui woke up early and softened the entire spirit field again. Soon after, several outer disciples arrived with spirit tools capable of mass seeding and planted the spirit field full of spirit rice.

Although the True Essence of the Golden Radiance Art would naturally activate when using the [Bug-Herb Slayer] technique, Ding Rui had long since controlled the Golden Radiance Art's True Essence to remain dormant, instead using the Earth Qi Art's True Essence to loosen the soil. These were basic operations.

Throughout the entire day, Ding Rui didn't even take a sip of water. Finally, before sunset, he completed all the tasks in the spirit field, ensuring that every spirit rice seed received its share of care, without missing a single one. But Ding Rui didn't feel relaxed; instead, he felt even more pressure.

Because the current spirit rice didn't require him to kill insects. Once the spirit rice germinated and grew for a certain period, he would have to perform weeding and insect killing simultaneously. [Frigid Flame Palm] required two hands, and [Bug-Herb Slayer] also required two hands. And he only had two hands, which meant he wouldn't be able to loosen the soil with the Earth Qi Hoe at the same time.
