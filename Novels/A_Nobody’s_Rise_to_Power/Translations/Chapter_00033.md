Chapter 33: Night Visit

In the rear hall of the main residence, Yu Xinglong and Suo Hong sat bolt upright.

They slowly turned the teacups in their hands, their worries completely undisguised.

Second Master Suo had been busy taking over the commercial routes ceded by the Yu family. He needed to lay out the Suo family's commercial channels on Yu territory to expand the Suo family's commercial empire. Among the Eight Great Clans, the Suo family's "business" was truly unique.

However, whether Suo Chanzhi was pregnant was of utmost importance to the Suo family, so he had to be present. Of the three renowned gynecologists summoned, one was brought by Second Master Suo.

"Congratulations, Master! Congratulations, Master! Our Young Mistress is with child!"

The three physicians were still conferring when a wet nurse ran to report the good news to the clan head.

Hearing the word "congratulations," Second Master Suo's eyes immediately lit up.

But Yu Xinglong's expression was indescribably complex.

The messenger servant, unaware of her master's complicated feelings, fell to her knees with a thud. She kowtowed firmly to the ground and said joyfully, "Master, Second Master Suo, our Young Mistress is with child."

Yu Xinglong's fingers trembled slightly, and scalding tea spilled onto them. But his hand only trembled a little; he still held the teacup steadily, seemingly unaware of the pain.

Finally, the other shoe had dropped. His daughter-in-law... was pregnant.

But was this child truly his son's flesh and blood?

Once suspicion takes root, it is like a venomous snake nesting in one's heart, occasionally darting out to bite him. But he had no way to confirm it. In this era, there was no technical means to make a reliable judgment on such matters. This was also one of the reasons why high-ranking officials and emperors kept a tight rein on their inner chambers.

However, calculating back from the time Suo Chanzhi became pregnant, she must have conceived while on the road to the Yu family's wedding procession. At that time, she was among the bridal party, and under the watchful eyes of so many people from both the Yu and Suo families, she was with her husband. How could there have been another man?

So, this child should be his son's flesh and blood, right?

But... his son had been determined to die. Could he really have lost control?

Yu Xinglong's mouth twitched, wanting to appear happy, but for a moment, he couldn't form the corresponding expression.

Second Master Suo, however, was already laughing to the heavens. "Ahahaha, good, good! Although Chengye has passed away, heaven has shown pity and left him an heir! Good, excellent, hahaha..."

"Brother Yu, congratulations, congratulations," Second Master Suo said, turning to Yu Xinglong with a beaming smile.

Yu Xinglong forcefully suppressed the tangled thoughts in his heart and forced a smile. "The same to you, the same to you. Ha, hahaha..."

Yu Xinglong's smile was uglier than a cry. But Second Master Suo didn't find it strange; the Yu Clan Head was clearly weeping with joy, which was perfectly normal.

Second Master Suo rubbed his half-bald head and looked at the beaming messenger wet nurse. "I'll make the decision for Clan Head Yu. Everyone in the main residence will receive a reward. You, servant, are the most quick-witted. You brought me the best news I could have wished for. I reward you with one hundred taels of silver."

The messenger servant was overjoyed. Her frantic run had not been in vain; she was nearly out of breath. The head servant immediately kowtowed to express her thanks. "This servant thanks Second Master Suo for the reward."

Yu Xinglong steadied himself and cleared his throat. "My son has just passed, so it is naturally not suitable to hold a grand celebration. However, my son has left behind flesh and blood, which is also a great joy for the Yu family. From today onward, the Young Mistress's household allowance will be doubled. All personnel of the main residence will have their monthly salary doubled for this month. Those who are head servants and above will each be granted a banquet."

The head servant kowtowed to Yu Xinglong with delight. "This servant thanks the Master on behalf of everyone. This servant will go and tell everyone the good news right away."

The head servant ran off in a hurry. Yu Xinglong was still wrestling in his heart: Is the child in my daughter-in-law's belly truly of the Yu bloodline? Is it or not?

The messenger head servant, light as a swallow, ran to the ornamental gate connecting the inner and outer courtyards. She stood on the steps, chest out and belly forward, beaming with pride. "Great joy for the Master! The Young Mistress is with child! The Master has decreed that all personnel of the main residence will have their monthly salary doubled for this month. Those who are head servants and above will each be granted a banquet!"

The outer courtyard stewards, who had been making excuses to linger in the nearby side rooms and making small talk, rushed out upon hearing the news. The Young Mistress was pregnant; the status of the main residence was secure! Well, to be precise, it was secure for at least nine months. No matter what, the chance of winning, which used to be a mere one in four, was slim. Now it had changed from a one-in-four probability to one in two. The advantage was theirs.

"Hahaha, the Master is blessed, and we've been touched by the joy!"

"Indeed, indeed! Great joy, great joy!"

The stewards beamed with smiles. Of course, they couldn't say "the same to you." This was the Master's joy; they were not qualified to share it.

Late at night, the main residence, inside and out, was still filled with joy.

In the "Lower Kitchen" dining hall, Li Damu, the bookkeeper, had received his reward of "one banquet" and invited the other stewards to drink and celebrate. Li Youcai, the chief steward, naturally took the seat of honor, but Yang Can was not seen in the second seat.

Li Damu had also invited Yang Can, but Yang Can said he was feeling a little unwell and needed to rest. "Feeling a little unwell" was a lie; it was likely that this steward, who had always been at odds with the Suo family, was truly unhappy upon hearing that the Young Mistress was pregnant. So, the considerate Accountant Li did not insist on inviting him again.

Inside the rear courtyard, Suo Chanzhi sat languidly before the bronze mirror at her dressing table. The joy and excitement gradually faded, and fatigue set in. So she only took a simple bath before changing into a misty gauze bellyband. The curves of her voluptuous figure appeared soft and smooth under the thin, soft silk robe. Her hair, especially lustrous after bathing, was draped over her fair shoulders. Like the leaves of the cloud flower, they did not compete for color, yet they enhanced it. The rosy face in the bronze mirror thus appeared even more enchanting.

Finally... she was pregnant. All the effort was not in vain... the many times.

Thinking of those "efforts," Suo Chanzhi felt a sudden itch in her heart. She actually missed the feeling of being thoroughly ravaged. How sick!

Suo Chanzhi cursed inwardly and subconsciously stroked her belly. It was truly marvelous. Just like that, just like that, with a few thrusts, a vibrant life was taking shape in her belly. But she still didn't know the gender of the child... Nine months later, it would be another difficult trial for her. If she didn't give birth to a boy, she wondered if she could pass that trial smoothly.

Suo Chanzhi sighed softly and picked up an ivory comb to smooth her hair. Whenever she was troubled, she liked to do this to calm her mind. Her soft, black hair, like black silk, fell over her fair, delicate shoulders, making her skin look even more translucent, like fine white jade.

Suddenly, her body trembled, and a cry of alarm was about to escape her lips. But a large hand quickly covered her mouth. Suo Chanzhi's beautiful eyes widened in terror, but she soon calmed down. Because in the finely polished bronze mirror, she saw Yang Can's face.

Yang Can let go of his hand, and Suo Chanzhi took a deep breath, twisting around on the silk-padded stool. Before her, Yang Can was wearing a scholar's robe. He hadn't changed into night clothes, nor was he masked. He had a handsome face with distinct features, and his posture was particularly straight.

"Are you crazy? How dare you sneak into the inner courtyard dressed like this?" Suo Chanzhi asked.

Yang Can smiled lightly. "Sneaking into the inner courtyard, if I'm not discovered, nothing will come of it. If I am discovered, the more I disguise myself, the harder it would be to explain, wouldn't it?"

Suo Chanzhi said nervously, "What are you doing here? It's very dangerous."

Yang Can said, "It's because you're pregnant. How could I not even see you once? It wouldn't be right." Yang Can sighed. "The child in your belly is also my flesh and blood."

Suo Chanzhi said impatiently, "But if you're discovered... You shouldn't have come."

"But I'm already here."

After saying this, Yang Can felt a strange sensation. To prevent their conversation from turning into a Gu Long-style exchange, Yang Can quickly changed the subject.

"Since you're already pregnant, we have no choice but to continue down the path Nurse Tu has planned."

Although they were following Nurse Tu's plan, they used to work for someone else, but now they were seeking their own IPO. The significance of the two was vastly different.

Yang Can said, "These past few days, many people have been waiting and seeing. They need to wait for a result before they can make a choice. I'm the same. I need to wait for news from you before I can decide whether to compete and how to compete. Now, we are just one step away from the final choice. And this last step, we can still find a way to make it turn out the way we want."

A sudden impulse surged in Suo Chanzhi's heart. She wanted to tell Yang Can not to try to control the main residence, and not to prepare for the "grafting" nine months from now. Even if this child is a girl, she would accept it. Even if she loses her position as the powerful Young Mistress of the main residence and can only be raised idly from now on, she would accept it. As long as this child can grow up safely and happily.

But if she loses everything she has fought for, can the child really grow up safely and happily? Even if she grows up顺利, won't she, like her, become a sacrifice to the family's interests?

Yang Can said, "From now on, I will have to do some things with a purpose. The inner courtyard will be left to you, and I will be responsible for the outer courtyard. In short, you must remember one thing: you must always pretend to dislike me, make things difficult for me, and resist me..."

Suo Chanzhi rolled her eyes at him. "There's no need to pretend."

Yang Can laughed. "Come on, don't I know whether your mouth is hard or soft?"

Suo Chanzhi's face immediately flushed. She coquettishly raised her crystal-white, frosty little foot and kicked him on the shin. Her foot,抽出 from her soft-soled sleepers, was soft and harmless.

Yang Can said, "Nine months. In nine months' time, can you turn the inner courtyard of the main residence into a solid block?"

Suo Chanzhi's heart skipped a beat. "What do you mean?"

Yang Can's eyes were profound. "I mean, from today on, you must make everyone in the inner courtyard believe that you are the true mistress of the main residence. Not only that, but you must also make them believe that the child in your belly is the future hope of the main residence. You must make them see you as their only choice."

Suo Chanzhi fell silent for a moment. "And you?"

Yang Can said, "I will make the outer courtyard see that I am the only one who can help you stabilize the situation. I will make them understand that only by following me can they have a future."

Suo Chanzhi said, "This is a huge gamble."

Yang Can said, "We've been gambling from the very beginning. The only difference is that this time, we have more筹码 (chips) in our hands."

He looked at Suo Chanzhi, his voice softening. "Trust me."

Suo Chanzhi looked into his eyes in the mirror. After a long while, she nodded slowly.

"Alright. But you have to promise me one thing."

"What is it?"

"If... if it's really impossible, let's just give up. I don't want our child to take any risks."

Yang Can's heart warmed. He reached out and gently stroked her hair.

"Don't worry. I will protect you, and I will protect our child."

He paused, then added, "I must go now. Stay safe."

With that, he turned and melted into the darkness as silently as he had arrived.

Suo Chanzhi sat alone in front of the mirror for a long time, her hand resting on her still flat belly. A complex expression flickered across her face—fear, anticipation, and an unspeakable tenderness.

Outside the window, the moon was high in the sky, and the night was deep. A new day was about to begin.
