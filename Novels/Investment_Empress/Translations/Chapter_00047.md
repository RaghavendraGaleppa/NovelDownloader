# Chapter 47: The True Power of a Divine Weapon, Heading to the Scripture Pavilion

Ying Bing knew there was a divine weapon in the Divine Edge Cave. In fact, the reason she knew this was also because of Shang Wu. When the Clear Abyss Sect was overthrown, Shang Wu paid a huge price to wield the Panjie Meteorite Hammer. Later, when Ying Bing went to the Central Divine Continent, she saw several divine weapons no weaker than the Panjie Meteorite Hammer. But ultimately, none of them gave her that feeling of boundless power.

That's right. Even with her experience, divine weapons were not common items. Divine weapons were two full tiers higher than Profound Artifacts. They were the ultimate manifestation of the forging path, the pinnacle that humanity could reach with all its craftsmanship. And beyond that? Those were Dao Weapons, born from seizing the fortunes of heaven and earth, emerging at the right moment. For example, the 'Rivers and Mountains Imperial Seal' held by successive emperors of the Great Yu Dynasty.

Getting back to the topic. She remembered that in her previous life, the Panjie Meteorite Hammer had no master. Shang Wu barely activated it once; after a fleeting display, both disappeared. When she first took charge of the Laurel Palace, she also inquired about this matter. But she only gathered some vague, unsubstantiated rumors, difficult to discern truth from falsehood.

"Elder Shang Wu... hmm?"

There was no answer from across for a long time. When Ying Bing looked up, she found that at some point, Shang Wu had fallen asleep in the rocking chair, letting out soft, even snores.

Not long after.

"Roasted lamb is ready." Li Mo came out with the prepared lamb. He placed it on the rack and began to light the fire. The young man's face was illuminated by the warm glow of the fire. It also reflected in Ying Bing's cool, clear eyes.

Could it be... related to him somehow? At that time, the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix's ethereal soul seemed to have a special fondness for him...

"Lend a hand." At this moment, the young man handed her a brush. Ying Bing tilted her head slightly in confusion. Li Mo then brought over an earthenware pot, from which a rich, spicy aroma wafted. Ying Bing realized. He was asking her to brush sauce onto the lamb.

"This is my specially concocted 'Soul Elixir'," Li Mo said. "Even 'Happy Sheep' would eat it and stay silent. It's all yours." As he spoke, he slowly turned the rotisserie.

And so. The Empress of Phoenix Heaven narrowed her eyes, her gaze shifting slightly. In the end, she picked up the brush, dipped it into the so-called 'Soul Elixir', and began her first cooking experience. Later, Little Li simply handed over the task of turning the rotisserie to her as well.

Not long after. The roasted lamb sizzled with oil. Watching Ying Bing apply sauce to the lamb not far away, her expression unexpectedly serious, Li Mo smiled inwardly. When the Ice Block cooked, she gained a touch of human warmth, no longer so cold. "Perhaps in the future, I can achieve fully automated feeding for the Ice Block?"

But. Soon, Little Li no longer thought that way.

"What's that smell?" Li Mo, who was preparing side dishes, smelled something burnt. He turned his head and found that the perfectly fine lamb had suffered a terrible fate. Half the lamb was burnt, and the other half was still raw. The young woman was still turning the lamb, seemingly completely unaware that anything was wrong.

Li Mo: "..."

He looked at Ying Bing helplessly, his expression a mix of amusement and exasperation. "No, sis, it's burnt! And you're still vigorously grilling the burnt side?"

Sensing his gaze, Ying Bing calmly met his eyes. "What's wrong?" She asked so righteously.

Alright. The Ice Block still had flaws, for example, she was pretty much destined to be estranged from kitchens for life.

"I'll do it, I'll do it."

...

After finishing this roasted lamb, which could have been breakfast or dinner, the sky had already brightened. In the room, "This meal for Master, was it worth five hundred taels of gold? Far exceeding the value of that jar of Azure Bamboo Brew."

"The Ice Block's 'feedback' was even more rewarding..."

Li Mo lay on the bed, taking a rare moment to count his money. Eight Profound Crystals. His gold had long since exceeded ten thousand taels. Silver... he was too lazy to count; some were silver ingots, some were bank notes, counting them was just tedious.

There were also some miscellaneous valuable items. Various six-pattern elixirs, ores, and rare flowers and herbs were all present.

"'Gloom Dispelling Pill', can cure a hundred poisons."

"'Wind Calling Rain Summoning Talisman'? Can bring three days of heavy rain, probably not needed for now."

"'Ancient Pine Grain Ring', looks exquisite and grand, it's fine as a decorative item to boost one's prestige..."

It took him less than half an hour. Li Mo finally sorted out the miscellaneous items. Afterwards, he entered his world seed. Here, compared to when he left, there were some slight changes. The area seemed to have expanded by several zhang compared to before. In front of the chessboard on the open ground, the Panjie Meteorite Hammer hung silently upside down. Not far from the hammer, the Chixiao Sword cowered in a corner, daring not to approach.

*Buzz—*

Sensing Li Mo's arrival, the hammer vibrated gently twice. The fierce, sharp aura of a weapon of war was still present. But it could no longer exert pressure on Li Mo. After all, he was the master here.

"Boundless strength." Li Mo chanted silently in his heart. Then he walked over, gripped the hammer's handle, and actually lifted it. With ease. He didn't even feel any weight. If not for the joyful emotions emanating from the Panjie Meteorite Hammer, one might have thought this divine weapon had been swapped for a fake.

*Whoosh—*

Li Mo swung it twice. Immediately, the fierce, sharp aura of a weapon of war caused sudden shifts in wind and clouds within the small world, as if the heavens were enraged. When he brought the hammer down, it was truly like a meteorite falling to earth, carrying immense power. At this moment, he seemed like a deity who could make heaven and earth collapse at will.

In Li Mo's current understanding, Elder Han He was a very powerful existence. He had a premonition. Even the slightest wisp of the hammer's wind he now stirred up would likely be unbearable for Elder Han He.

"As expected of a divine weapon." Li Mo let out a long breath. "This must be its true power."

The Panjie Meteorite Hammer buzzed continuously, growing more excited; it seemed it hadn't been wielded to its full potential in a long time.

"Want... to go out..."

Vaguely. Li Mo seemed to hear a childish voice. Was it the Panjie Meteorite Hammer? He lowered his head, confirming the source of the voice.

"Fight..."

He understood the divine weapon's meaning. It wanted to smash something. For example, people, or exotic beasts. As long as it wasn't used to forge other weapons.

Li Mo: "..."

"I want to too. But my strength doesn't allow it."

*Buzz—*

The Panjie Meteorite Hammer felt a little wronged; its weak sentience couldn't understand overly complex matters. Why was its master sometimes strong, sometimes weak? Why could its master clearly unleash its power to the fullest, yet wouldn't take it out to play?

"When the time is right, I will naturally let you shine brilliantly," Li Mo gently comforted it.

After comforting the divine weapon, he began to think seriously. "I already have a divine weapon hammer. Should I... also look for a hammer technique?" Having experienced the divine weapon's power, a hint of yearning arose in Li Mo's heart. "For a swordsman like me to know a few hammer techniques, it should be quite reasonable, right?" Yet, among the investment feedbacks he received, there truly were no martial arts related to hammer techniques.

"Oh, right. The first-place winner of the sect trial seems to be able to go to the fifth floor of the Scripture Pavilion to choose martial arts? Let's go take a look."

Thinking this. Li Mo restored his chaotic small world and then waved at the Chixiao Sword not far away. "Come here."

*Buzz—*

As soon as he spoke, the Panjie Meteorite Hammer vibrated twice, like a father disciplining a naughty child. Only then did the Chixiao Sword slowly float into his palm. Taking the sword, Li Mo exited the world seed. He greeted the half-asleep, half-awake Shang Wu, then left the room and headed towards the Scripture Pavilion.
