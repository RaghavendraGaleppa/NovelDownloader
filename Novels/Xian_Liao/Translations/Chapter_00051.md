# Chapter 51: The Underworld

"Manuscripts from Master Jingyang?"

Zhou Qing invited Xiao Ruowang into his courtyard and seated him at the stone table beneath the mulberry tree. After hearing Xiao Ruowang's explanation, Zhou Qing finally understood the reason for this visit.

He was familiar with Master Jingyang from the records in Qingfu Temple's archives, but he hadn't expected that after refining the Heart-Mending Pills, he would receive a gift in return from Prince Qinghe. Moreover, he now knew exactly whose life the pills had saved.

The recipient was Princess Yuan Mingyue, the beloved daughter of Prince Qinghe Yuan Hua. Born with a congenital heart condition, Yuan Mingyue had been kept alive by renowned physicians, but as she grew older, her condition became increasingly difficult to manage. Without the Heart-Mending Pills—a secret formula of the Taihe Sect that Zhou Qing had refined—she likely wouldn't have survived past the end of the year.

With the pills and careful nursing in Prince Qinghe's residence, Yuan Mingyue could now expect to live a life comparable to that of an ordinary person. This outcome delighted Prince Yuan Hua so much that, in gratitude for Zhou Qing's contribution, he sent over Master Jingyang's manuscripts.

Xiao Ruowang explained this with a smile, "If the Jieyuan doesn't care for these manuscripts, our Taihe Sect would be willing to purchase them back at a high price."

Zhou Qing wasn't short on money. Moreover, once Butcher Hu's Black Tiger Gang finished dealing with the remnants of the Fierce Tiger Gang, another windfall would come his way, further padding his pockets. He held deep reverence for Master Jingyang, a revered Daoist predecessor, and had no intention of parting with the manuscripts.

With a faint smile, he replied, "I appreciate this gift very much. Please convey my gratitude to the prince upon your return, and extend my regards to Sect Leader Zhang as well."

Xiao Ruowang had only been joking. While Master Jingyang's manuscripts were indeed valuable, the Taihe Sect had similar works in their collection and wouldn't insist on reclaiming Zhou Qing's copy.

Later, Zhou Qing used the excuse that Fuxiang missed Xiao Ruowang to invite him up the mountain. Xiao Ruowang hadn't forgotten how Fuxiang had taken advantage of his weakened state during their last encounter. This time, he intended to test Fuxiang again at full strength. Despite his mild temperament, as a martial artist who cultivated qi and blood, he still sought to prove his prowess. Thus, he readily agreed.

The two Daoist priests who had accompanied Xiao Ruowang last time were present again. Zhishan got along well with them, so the group ascended the mountain together.

Fuxiang was delighted to see Xiao Ruowang return. "Junior Brother, you truly understand propriety. Last time, Daoist Xiao left our Qingfu Temple in such a hurry that we didn't have the chance to properly host him. This time, let's ensure Daoist Xiao stays longer so we can spar morning and night."

Xiao Ruowang smiled faintly. "This humble Daoist also looks forward to receiving Daoist Fuxiang's guidance."

...

A quarter of an hour later, Fuxiang appeared somewhat disheveled. He turned to Zhishan with a reproachful tone. "Nephew, didn't I tell you not to clean the square so thoroughly? Why didn't you listen? The ground is so slippery—what if a visiting pilgrim falls?"

During his recent spar with Xiao Ruowang, Fuxiang had used the first few moves of his newly created "Eight Trigrams Subduing Dragon Palm" and had narrowly lost. With his sharp wit, he quickly identified the reasons.

First, the ground was too slippery. As the saying goes, aging starts with the legs—hadn't he suffered because of this?

Second, his criticism of Zhishan wasn't solely about his own embarrassment but also concern for the temple's reputation. As the abbot, he had to be cautious about such details to prevent accidents that might tarnish Qingfu Temple's name.

"But, Master... Abbot, I didn't clean the square today, and it's not slippery..." Zhishan murmured in protest.

Fuxiang's temper flared. "Look at you—after spending some time away from the mountain, you've learned to talk back. You don't respect me as your abbot at all. Senior Brother, how am I supposed to continue as abbot when your disciples show me no respect? Your spirit in heaven must see how your disciples disregard me..."

Zhou Qing, watching from the side, rolled his eyes. He somewhat regretted bringing Xiao Ruowang up the mountain—this was too embarrassing.

Xiao Ruowang, ever gracious, stepped in to mediate. "Abbot Fuxiang, our match was evenly matched, and the ground was indeed a bit slippery."

"Ah, Infinite Heavenly Lord, I knew it! The ground was slippery. However, my nephew's skills are still lacking—he couldn't perceive such subtleties. Daoist Xiao, with skills comparable to mine, naturally noticed. The Taihe Sect truly has worthy successors." Fuxiang sighed with admiration.

Although Qingfu Temple had Zhou Qing, Zhou Qing hadn't undergone formal ordination and wasn't a true inheritor of the sect. Moreover, as a Jieyuan (top provincial scholar), his status was slightly higher than the abbot's, and he was Fuxiang's peer. In any case, he couldn't be counted among the "worthy successors."

Xiao Ruowang found Fuxiang's reasoning both amusing and exasperating. Still, he genuinely admired Fuxiang's martial prowess. The incomplete "Eight Trigrams Subduing Dragon Palm" had given him considerable trouble. If not for Fuxiang's age affecting his stamina, it was uncertain whether Xiao Ruowang would have emerged slightly victorious.

This also demonstrated the formidable nature of the Taihe Sect's "One Qi Dawn Scripture." Xiao Ruowang's master, Sect Leader Zhang Jingxiu, was older than Fuxiang yet rose each day with vigorous qi and blood, his endurance in combat nearly matching that of his youth. Moreover, Zhang Jingxiu's skills had only grown more refined with age, allowing him to effortlessly exploit his opponents' weaknesses with flawless techniques.

In battles against peers, Zhang Jingxiu exhibited overwhelming dominance. His master had told him this was a spiritual realm—something that could be called "divine clarity." Xiao Ruowang only half-understood this concept.

...

Half a month after the death of Chen Hu, leader of the Fierce Tiger Gang, Butcher Hu returned to Zhou Qing's courtyard. The modest Zhou residence now wielded considerable influence over Jiangzhou City's affairs. Zhou Qing even felt a sense of being the city's underworld patriarch.

Former neighbors from the slums and villagers from Hu Village would come to Zhou Qing through Butcher Hu when faced with insurmountable difficulties that Butcher Hu couldn't resolve alone. If Zhou Qing deemed their pleas worthy, he would help them regardless of cost.

Such instances were rare, but each act of benevolence added a touch of divinity to Zhou Qing in the eyes of those who knew. Wasn't he like a deity relieving suffering? Though Zhou Qing wasn't one to grant every request, those who sought him out through Butcher Hu usually found their problems resolved—Butcher Hu included.

This inadvertently elevated Butcher Hu's status, which was precisely Zhou Qing's intention. He aimed to cultivate Butcher Hu as his proxy, enhancing his influence. Since Butcher Hu had started martial arts training too late to achieve greatness, Zhou Qing needed to bolster his standing to facilitate handling mundane affairs on his behalf.

It was akin to an emperor's eunuch—loyalty mattered more than ability. Take, for instance, the Sun Moon Holy Cult in "The Smiling, Proud Wanderer." When Ren Woxing handed the sect's affairs to Dongfang Bubai, whose talent rivaled his own, what was the outcome?

Talented individuals were rare, but they had to be one's own people first. While relying on trusted aides had its drawbacks, historical lessons reminded later generations that this remained the safest approach. Human hearts were unpredictable; even close allies might betray one day.

Navigating his position, Zhou Qing could only feel his way forward, drawing on knowledge from past readings, films, and related materials for reference. Fortunately, with his current resources, he could afford mistakes within Jiangzhou's bounds.

Given his alchemical skills, even the emperor might take notice. But the capital's political waters ran too deep for Zhou Qing to navigate at present. While greater risks promised greater rewards, that was a survival tactic for the desperate—Zhou Qing had no need for it.

Butcher Hu presented the Fierce Tiger Gang's ledgers and sealed letters—the latter untouched by him. When it came to confidential matters, unless Zhou Qing permitted it, Butcher Hu wouldn't pry. Just as with Zhou Qing's personal secrets, even if he noticed them, he wouldn't inquire. His life's goal was to rise through Zhou Qing's patronage, not to meddle in his affairs.

After absorbing the Fierce Tiger Gang, the Black Tiger Gang ranked among Jiangzhou's top underworld factions. Zhou Qing set aside the ledgers, keeping only the letters, and asked, "What are your plans now?"

As for the spoils from conquering the Fierce Tiger Gang, Zhou Qing didn't inquire—they were his to command at will. Should Butcher Hu prove obstructive in this regard, he'd no longer be fit for his position. But Zhou Qing trusted Butcher Hu wouldn't make such a mistake.

"This humble one plans to enter the grain trade, ideally securing a thirty percent share."

"The grain trade is a sound choice. The Lin family deals in grains too—consult Miss Lin. She'll assist you in focusing on this business. But once you've decided, don't overstep."

"Understood."

Zhou Qing nodded. "Any reaction from Golden Light Temple?"

Butcher Hu shook his head. "None—perhaps due to my limited capabilities. However, Golden Light Temple has been interacting closely with the Haisha Gang recently."

The Haisha Gang operated in water transport, its influence spanning multiple prefectures all the way to the sea—far surpassing the Fierce Tiger Gang's reach. Zhou Qing immediately understood: the Fierce Tiger Gang had been a sacrificial pawn, offered by Golden Light Temple to appease his wrath.

Allowing Zhou Qing's faction to absorb the Fierce Tiger Gang likely marked Golden Light Temple's limit. Further encroachment would provoke retaliation. While the temple couldn't openly move against Zhou Qing, it could target those around him.

Of course, the ideal scenario would be reconciliation between Zhou Qing and Golden Light Temple, allowing them to jointly dominate Jiangzhou. But Zhou Qing knew this would be like making a pact with a tiger—his current resources and talent pool paled in comparison to the temple's. Moreover, such an alliance would draw suppression from the ambitious and ruthless Prefect Ling, who wouldn't tolerate Jiangzhou slipping from his control.

Thus, Zhou Qing had no choice but to oppose Golden Light Temple, both out of vengeance and strategic necessity. After swallowing the Fierce Tiger Gang, however, he needed time to consolidate and expand his base. The grain trade would only grow more critical as times turned turbulent—Butcher Hu's choice was sound.

"Leave Golden Light Temple be for now. Report any unusual activity immediately. Next, gather renowned hunters from nearby areas. Have them map the terrains they've explored and record any strange occurrences they've witnessed—it may prove useful later."

"Aye."

Having relied too heavily on elixirs in the past, Zhou Qing now saw his current cultivation without them as an opportunity to temper his will. Progress, whether fast or slow, was still progress. Even if it took until next year to master the Ape Play, he'd still be under seventeen. Before twenty, he could grind all Five Animal Exercises to proficiency.

At twenty, the body hadn't even fully matured yet. Haste made waste—cultivation required patience. When swift advancement was possible, he'd charge ahead; when slowing down was necessary, he'd remain calm and steady.

Between cultivation and study, Zhou Qing also examined the beast hides left by Blacksmith Hu and those gifted by Chang Wanli. Though similar in material and size, their secrets eluded him. The time wasn't ripe.

He wasn't in a hurry to uncover them, suspecting they were connected to the Immortal Mist Sect's destruction and Blacksmith Hu's disappearance. Some hidden force might be searching for these hides—there was no need to expose himself prematurely. The truth would emerge eventually.

What Zhou Qing most anticipated now was advancing the Ape Play to proficiency. First, to observe its qi-refining effects; second, to complete the Six-Word Health Preservation Technique, which might unlock the "Rudimentary" evaluation for the wondrous skill "Palm Lightning."

"Palm Lightning" sounded extraordinary. Moreover, apart from existing names, the Health Preservation Master's designations were based on Zhou Qing's memories and personal understanding.

...

Zhou Qing's current focus was on steady progress, consolidating his gains while biding his time against Golden Light Temple. With patience and strategy, he would continue to strengthen his position in Jiangzhou's intricate web of power.
