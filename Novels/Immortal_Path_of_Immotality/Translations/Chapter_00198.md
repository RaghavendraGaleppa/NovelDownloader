# Chapter 196: Thunder Pool Celestial Phenomenon

In the end, Lin Shan successfully obtained the Demon Taro Fruit. The "Scholar" had compromised slightly with him, exchanging it for a piece of Illusion Spirit Wood and a bottle of Illusion Spirit Liquid.

Lin Shan had no objections. The Illusion Spirit Liquid required large quantities to be applied or ingested to be effective. A single bottle would hardly bring about any significant transformation. It seemed the Scholar intended to use it to assist in cultivating some illusion-based magical techniques, but Lin Shan couldn't be bothered to delve deeper.

As the trading session concluded, most participants had exchanged for what they desired, except for a few disgruntled individuals. The host paid them little mind.

"If there's nothing else, esteemed fellow cultivators may leave through the underground secret passage. The passage is equipped with a labyrinth illusion array and has dozens of exits throughout the city. Please proceed!"

Most of the attendees were familiar faces, having participated several times before. They stood up one by one and descended to leave through the secret passage.

Lin Shan followed the crowd.

---

After emerging from the secret passage, he found himself in the western part of the city instead of the northern district where he had entered.

Walking cautiously through the streets, Lin Shan repeatedly checked for any signs of being followed before safely returning to his cave abode.

Black Skeleton Demon Lord was in the courtyard delivering a lecture. Over the past decade, the Lin Trading Company had expanded several times in scale. Forty to fifty young Qi Refining cultivators stood in neat rows, hands behind their backs, dressed in uniform company attire, listening attentively to their supervisor's earnest teachings.

Witnessing this scene, Lin Shan realized that merely renting warehouses and wholesale markets wasn't enough. It was time to lease a dedicated company headquarters. Having employees report to his cave abode daily was hardly appropriate.

After the lecture, the employees, invigorated and motivated, left the cave to begin their work.

Black Skeleton Demon Lord looked at Lin Shan expectantly. Without wasting words, Lin Shan tossed over the jade box containing the Demon Taro Fruit.

Opening it, the demon chuckled, then seemed about to say something. But before it could speak, Lin Shan threw it another bag of spirit stones.

In the early stages of entrepreneurship, one must be willing to invest. Given that Black Skeleton had secured the "Moonview Token" for him, granting access to the high-end trading session and several valuable items, Lin Shan decided to offer full support.

Having received everything it wanted, Black Skeleton Demon Lord left satisfied.

Lin Shan considered giving it some advice but ultimately decided to delegate fully. His primary focus now was cultivation; he shouldn't be distracted by other matters.

Entering his meditation chamber, Lin Shan sat cross-legged and took out the gray-blue clam shell he had acquired earlier—the minor divine ability "Lightning Storm." He began carefully studying its contents.

---

Three months later, Lin Shan looked at the now-dull clam shell in his hand. The "divine intent" within had been fully absorbed, leaving it as nothing more than an ordinary discarded spirit material. Had it been recorded in jade slips, given his comprehension abilities, it would have taken him much longer to grasp.

He stored the shell away and focused on the depths of his soul, where three faint glows shimmered.

A purple-black divine ability seed, a white spell imprint, and a cyan-blue minor divine ability imprint.

The purple-black seed was a gift from the immortal artifact "Nailhead Seven Arrow Book," which had bestowed the divine ability upon him across the void. To this day, Lin Shan didn't understand why the book had been so generous. Was it simply because he had activated the straw effigy? 

Back then, he was only at the Qi Refining stage. Could the artifact's spirit have recognized his potential and invested in him from another realm?

Now, with increased cultivation and broader knowledge, Lin Shan couldn't help but be suspicious. Previously, he had felt a sense of urgency, fearing others might claim the unowned immortal artifact before him. But looking back, how could the spirit of an immortal artifact be simple? 

Moreover, this artifact had even formed a summoning contract with the Eighteen Layers of Hell, aiding hellish creatures in projecting avatars across myriad worlds. Its schemes and ambitions were beyond those of a mere artifact spirit—it was more like a seasoned ancient monster.

"What schemes does the Immortal Book have? What connection does it have with the Hell World? What grand design is it orchestrating?"

At his current level, pondering these questions yielded no answers. Since the artifact had only helped him so far, he decided not to dwell on it. For now, it was beneficial and harmless.

The white spell imprint was the Summoning Technique, a high-level spell that could forcibly contract creatures at the Foundation Establishment stage or below. For higher-level creatures, voluntary submission was one thing, but if unwilling, they could easily break free.

Grandmaster Huang had willingly formed a contract with him, likely due to Elder Yan's influence, to avoid exposing himself.

To forcibly contract Golden Core stage or higher creatures, the spell imprint would need to be upgraded to a minor divine ability, and the summoning banner would need to be refined into a magic treasure.

However, Lin Shan's current strength was insufficient to contend with Golden Core stage beings.

Moreover, his contract with Grandmaster Huang was largely useless since his summoning banner was only a high-level magic tool, incapable of withstanding the transmission of a Nascent Soul stage entity. An immortal treasure would be required for that.

The cyan-blue minor divine ability imprint appeared in the enhancement panel:

**Lightning Storm**  
Quality: Minor Divine Ability Imprint  
Description: [Folded]  
Enhancement Cost: 64 points  

A minor divine ability imprint represented his initial mastery of the technique.

---

Since his "Wind and Lightning Spiritual Roots" met the requirements, coupled with improved comprehension and the "divine intent" from the clam shell, Lin Shan had managed to grasp a minor divine ability at the Foundation Establishment stage.

However, anything short of a divine ability seed came with a casting delay. This made it susceptible to interruption, potentially causing chaotic energy flow and missed opportunities.

In battles, every moment was critical. Sometimes, before a minor divine ability could be cast, the opponent might already have set up a lethal strike. Countless cultivators had met their downfall due to such delays.

Only a divine ability seed represented complete mastery—instinctive and instantaneous, capable of earth-shattering power upon release.

Of course, achieving this required not only extensive practice (tens of thousands of repetitions) but also top-tier comprehension. Even Black Skeleton Demon Lord hadn't managed to condense a divine ability seed for its racial technique.

"A minor divine ability imprint is too shabby! Go big or go home!"

Lin Shan, brimming with ambition and ample ancient charm, decided to enhance the "Wind and Lightning" minor divine ability into a full-fledged sect-guarding divine ability.

With this, who among his peers at the Foundation Establishment stage could rival him? He might even stand a chance against higher realms.

Without hesitation, Lin Shan selected "Enhance." This was his first time directly enhancing a divine ability.

The cyan-blue imprint in his soul trembled as strands of energy wove in and out. Memories of manipulating primordial energy and newfound insights flooded his mind.

In a trance, he found himself on a vast, desolate land under a darkened sky. Countless towering tornadoes swirled, and thunder roared incessantly. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning spanning the heavens struck down.

The world became a sea of electric plasma, as if an ancient thunder god had descended to deliver divine punishment. Dazzling white light overwhelmed him.

When he regained his senses, a half-green, half-blue seed spun lazily in his mind.

The enhancement panel updated:

**Thunderstorm**  
Rank: Divine Ability  
Description: Advanced version of "Lightning Storm." A wind and lightning offensive divine ability capable of altering celestial phenomena on a large scale, summoning Nine Heavens Gale and Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation for area-of-effect and precision strikes.  
Enhancement Cost: 128 points  

---

"Nine Heavens Gale! Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation!"

Lin Shan was stunned.

Nine Heavens Gale was a natural phenomenon, said to pervade the highest heavens of this world. Only Nascent Soul stage cultivators could traverse it without perishing.

Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation was the first heavenly punishment cultivators faced—twenty-seven bolts of lightning during the Golden Core to Nascent Soul breakthrough. It was a trial that terrified even the most seasoned Golden Core cultivators.

The enhanced "Thunderstorm" was a true divine ability, far surpassing the minor "Lightning Storm." With Nine Heavens Gale for area clearing and Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation for precision strikes, it could serve as a sect-guarding divine ability even among top-tier sects!

Lin Shan marveled at the divine ability seed in his soul. At his current mid-Foundation Establishment stage, how many tribulation bolts could he summon? The thought made him itch to test it.

But as the idea formed, the cyan-blue seed trembled slightly.

Above his cave abode, within a hundred-meter radius, tiny transparent tornadoes materialized. Countless hair-thin lightning threads crackled in the air, and a golden thunder pool faintly appeared in the sky. The sudden celestial phenomenon startled the entire Moonview City.

Cultivators throughout the city gaped at the sky, pointing and exclaiming.

"Look! What's that in the sky?"

"Is that... a golden thunder pool? A heavenly tribulation?"

"Is some senior attempting a Nascent Soul breakthrough here?"

"Wouldn't the tribulation lightning destroy half the city?"

"Shouldn't we... run?"

A collective realization dawned.

"Shit!"

"Run! Get out of the city now!"

The entire city erupted into chaos. Foundation Establishment cultivators ignored flight restrictions, scrambling onto their artifacts. Qi Refining cultivators flooded the streets in panic.

The few Golden Core cultivators, though alarmed, hesitated. Who would be reckless enough to attempt a breakthrough here? They debated intervening.

But moments later, the phenomenon vanished as abruptly as it appeared. The crowd stood bewildered.

Lin Shan, unaware of the commotion, had only inadvertently triggered the divine ability seed without fully activating it. Fortunately, his cave was in a less affluent area, and the minor energy fluctuations went unnoticed amidst the spectacle.

Meanwhile, frantic knocking sounded at his door. Black Skeleton Demon Lord had rushed back, proving its loyalty—or perhaps bound by their contract and its designs on Lin Shan's treasures.

Opening the door, Lin Shan frowned at the disturbance.

"What's the hurry?"

Black Skeleton glanced at the now-clear sky and sheepishly left.

Unbeknownst to them, the incident had stirred widespread speculation. Many Golden Core cultivators suspected the Li family's patriarch, the only late-Golden Core cultivator in the city, was behind it.

The Li patriarch, unaware, became the scapegoat for Lin Shan's accidental display.

With a sect-guarding divine ability now in his arsenal, Lin Shan felt invigorated. Checking his remaining ancient charm—106 points—he noted he had enough to enhance Purple Heart Pills for a smooth breakthrough to late-Foundation Establishment.

His path to Golden Core was now clear.

Knowing when to advance and when to lay low, Lin Shan resolved to focus on cultivation, converting his resources into strength.

---

Five years passed in the blink of an eye.

Earlier, the Confucian families of Lu Kingdom had announced the complete eradication of the three demonic sects, with only a few high-ranking members remaining at large.

During these five years, Moonview City witnessed a major incident.

One night, six disguised Golden Core cultivators stormed the Li family's residence in the western district, ambushing and killing the patriarch in his secluded meditation. Though the late-Golden Core patriarch took two attackers with him, the Li family was obliterated in the aftermath.

The city's no-conflict rule, tacitly ignored by its Golden Core overseers, left the populace uneasy. A half-hearted investigation yielded no results.

Meanwhile, the "Cloudstride Trading Company" rose to prominence in Lu Kingdom for inventing a revolutionary artifact—the "Messenger," a communication device capable of instant information exchange across vast distances.

Its inventor, Ma Wentong, a prodigy from Hongshan True Knowledge Academy, envisioned replacing traditional couriers. The "Messenger" relied on a central "Mother Artifact" crafted from rare sixth-tier "Mystic Gray Spirit Stone," enabling real-time communication across half the kingdom.

While revolutionary, the invention faced fierce opposition from established powers wary of losing control over information dissemination. True Knowledge Academy and Cloudstride Trading Company were soon attacked, their members slaughtered, and the Mother Artifact seized by a mysterious figure rumored to wield a three-foot azure lotus.

Ma Wentong himself vanished, reportedly rescued by a "lotus-skirted woman."

Amidst the upheaval, Lin Shan remained secluded, diligently cultivating in his cave, oblivious to the world's transformations.
