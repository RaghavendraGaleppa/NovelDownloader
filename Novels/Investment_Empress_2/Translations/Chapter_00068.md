# Chapter 68: Senior Brother Li is Truly Noble and Upright; Feedback: A Primordial Weapon Embryo

Seeing Li Mo’s casual expression, Xiao Qin thought he didn't know the item's value.

"Senior Brother Li, this item is useful for the Divine Observation Realm and even higher realms. It is an extremely precious treasure!"

*If only I had this,* Thousand Form Martial Master thought. *My soul would be able to restore thirty percent of its peak strength.*

But his disciple was just too upright.

Well, that’s a good thing... If Xiao Qin’s character were flawed, he wouldn't have considered him a successor.

Li Mo smiled helplessly.

Nowadays, even giving people benefits required scheming.

Was giving gifts really such a scholarly pursuit?

"Then, this thing isn't useful to me in the short term, is it?"

"That is true..."

Xiao Qin’s expression froze, and he nodded.

Li Mo continued, "Do you want it?"

"Naturally..."

Xiao Qin nodded blankly.

"Then, for me right now, the only value of this item is that it can be used to help a friend, right?"

"That makes sense."

Xiao Qin thought about it. Li Mo made so much sense that he couldn't refute him.

Li Mo continued to guide him step by step, "Then, aren't we good friends?"

"Naturally!" Xiao Qin immediately straightened his face and said seriously.

"Then isn't the problem solved? Take it."

Li Mo beamed and slapped the heavy Yin Soul-Nourishing Wood into Xiao Qin's hand.

Xiao Qin opened his mouth.

Is... is that how it works?

He felt something was off, but he couldn't pinpoint what was wrong.

Thousand Form Martial Master also felt incredibly strange.

He was an old fox who had lived long enough to see through everything. He naturally saw that his disciple had been led into a ditch by this brat Li.

But in his two lifetimes, this was the first time he had seen someone lead another into a ditch just to give them a benefit.

If one called it swindling, the guy was actually quite nice.

It was absurd.

"Alright. Senior Brother Xiao will be able to achieve great things in the future. By then, items like this won't be considered precious at all. I'm going to hand in my mission now."

With that, Li Mo said no more.

Fearing that Xiao Qin would return the item, he turned and left.

"No wonder everyone in the sect says that Senior Brother Li is noble and upright, possessing the style of an ancient sage. Compared to him, I am nothing but a bright and open person."

Xiao Qin watched that carefree figure leave, his heart filled with mixed emotions. He already felt he owed Brother Li a favor, but now he owed even more.

But Senior Brother Li had said so much; he really couldn't refuse.

Besides, his master really needed this item urgently.

"Hmph. You actually remembered this old man."

In his mind, Thousand Form Martial Master snorted.

"Master, I didn't mean anything else..."

Xiao Qin felt a bit awkward.

"Alright, I know your character. If not for that, I wouldn't have entrusted my life and death to you."

Thousand Form Martial Master wasn't actually angry.

Instead, he continued, "That brat Li is indeed a person worth befriending, and... he himself is extremely extraordinary. You need to work harder to see if you can catch up to his footsteps."

Xiao Qin was about to nod when he froze.

Catch up to Senior Brother Li's footsteps?

He had broken through and then established himself anew, scattering his cultivation to start over. He had only just reached the perfection of the twelfth meridian in the Blood Qi Realm.

Senior Brother Li couldn't have condensed Inner Qi already, could he?

Seeing through his foolish disciple's thoughts, Thousand Form Martial Master said, "It is more shocking than you imagine. Although he hasn't condensed Inner Qi, he has walked much further on the path of the Blood Qi Realm than you. I don't know exactly how many meridians he has, but it is definitely far more than twelve."

Thousand Form Martial Master was, after all, a supreme figure from the past. Even with only his soul left, his perception was far beyond that of an ordinary person.

"More than twelve?"

Xiao Qin was touched on his blind spot of knowledge and found it somewhat unbelievable.

"For the martial path, you are still a frog in a well. The heavens and earth bestow their creations, and everyone indeed only has twelve main meridians. But some are born to seize the creations of heaven and earth, with foundations far exceeding the ordinary. I myself once possessed fifteen main meridians, far surpassing my peers."

Thousand Form Martial Master's voice was light but filled with pride.

As soon as his voice fell, the voice of the deacon from the Outer Affairs Hall came through:

"Verification complete. True Disciple Li Mo, hunted down one criminal of the Inner Qi Condensation Realm. Reward: five thousand Contribution Points!"

Inner Qi Condensation Realm!

Xiao Qin's spirit shook, and his eyes widened.

He was just feeling a bit of secret joy about to break through to the Inner Qi Realm, yet Senior Brother Li could already kill criminals of the Condensation Realm?

Terrifying!

"Hmph, as expected. He might be comparable to me back in the day. By that logic, Ying Bing is even more exaggerated. No wonder she is still in the Blood Qi Realm."

Thousand Form Martial Master said quite seriously.

"How then am I supposed to catch up to Senior Brother Li?"

Xiao Qin felt a sense of powerlessness in his heart.

He had a master guiding him, yet he was still left so far behind. Would he be left further and further behind in the future?

"Hahaha... Innate talent is indeed important, but before the destiny of the world is decided, who says one cannot catch up from behind?"

Thousand Form Martial Master wanted to give his disciple pressure, not make him lose his enterprising spirit.

So, as if predicting the future, he said, "What I am proud of is not those fifteen main meridians, but the 'Thousand Form Art'! Once you reach the Divine Observation Realm, you will naturally understand its mystery."

"Okay!"

Xiao Qin clenched his fists, his fighting spirit reignited.

If he couldn't even catch up to Senior Brother Li's back in the future, how could he repay him?

...

Inside the Outer Affairs Hall.

"Cutting an Inner Qi Realm with Blood Qi? This is a True Disciple for you."

"Hmph, don't think that just because Senior Brother Li is a good person, he is just a pushover."

"Why is Senior Brother Li so strong?"

"Have you forgotten who his master is? It's Elder Shang Wu."

"I can understand then."

...

After exchanging greetings with a few familiar disciples, Little Li was quite happy.

It wasn't because of the five thousand Contribution Points just credited to his account, but because the system had sent a prompt.

**[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested a 'Yin Soul-Nourishing Wood' in 'Xiao Qin'.]**

**[Investment Feedback: One Primordial Weapon Embryo.]**

**[Primordial Weapon Embryo]: "Can generate a high-grade Primordial Weapon similar to the weapon template provided by the Host."**

Although Little Li was reluctant to admit it, he had to acknowledge that he currently lacked a suitable hammer.

He couldn't even lift a Divine Weapon with his current realm, let alone use it.

Even if his physique was strong enough to use it with the加持 of World Power, it could only be used as a last resort.

With this Primordial Weapon Embryo, he could use the Panjie Meteor Hammer as a template to create a 'replica'.

"Senior Brother Li, is there anything you need to exchange?"

The Inner Sect deacon saw him standing there and thought he was thinking about what to exchange for.

"Yes."

"I need some exotic beast meat."

Li Mo came back to his senses and nodded.

"Oh?"

The Inner Sect deacon was a bit surprised, but then said, "Although exotic beast meat isn't as effective as pills, it is solid and doesn't have redundant pill toxins. It seems Senior Brother Li thinks very far ahead. Do you need the type to condense Blood Qi, strengthen the physique, or break through a realm?"

"I want the delicious kind."
