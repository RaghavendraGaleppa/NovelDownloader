# A Brief Author's Note on the Book's Launch  

Honestly, I don’t have much to say.  

This is my first time writing a book, and I’m still learning a lot—everything from screenwriting theory to novel-writing techniques and studying the styles of popular books on the bestseller lists. Every day is a learning experience.  

The main reason I started writing this book was simply to learn how to write a full-length novel. Through this project, I also wanted to figure out what readers enjoy, what they don’t, and where my own weaknesses lie so I can analyze and improve. Maybe once we have a reader group, you can all share your thoughts and suggestions!  

To be honest, from the moment I started writing until now, I’ve learned a great deal. The most important lesson has probably been maintaining consistency in the story’s tone (some of you might already know where things went wrong—it cost me a lot of readers at the time).  

Looking ahead, I still want to experiment with new elements while keeping the story engaging. But I’ll definitely avoid making the same pacing mistakes as before.  

Now, let’s talk about updates.  

I’m painfully slow at writing. Earlier, when I mentioned having a few chapters saved up, it was literally just two—and I posted them yesterday. Today, I wrote nonstop from morning until 11 PM and barely managed 11,000 words.  

But after this intense writing session, I feel like I can keep it up. So, during the National Day holiday, I’ll aim for five updates a day, maybe even six if I push myself. After the holiday, I’ll guarantee at least four daily updates.  

I didn’t do a big update blitz for the launch, so consider this a debt I owe you. I also owe an extra chapter for the support from Warm Sun (暖阳大佬). I’ll find a way to make it up.  

Since my updates are admittedly lacking, I won’t shamelessly ask for votes—just hope you enjoy the story!  

Still, I’m truly grateful for all the recommendation and monthly votes you’ve given me. Thank you!  

That’s all.  

With deepest gratitude to all my readers!  

*Bows repeatedly*
