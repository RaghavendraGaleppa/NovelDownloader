# Chapter 152: The Bizarre Rules of Green Lotus Manor  

In the southern reaches of Nanyang Prefecture stood Green Lotus Mountain, home to the secluded Green Lotus Manor.  

Mist drifted lazily around the mountainside, occasionally broken by the distant calls of mountain birds, lending the place an air of serene tranquility.  

But today, the quiet was disrupted as figures began gathering before the ornate archway marking the manor's entrance, the scene growing increasingly lively.  

It was already the ninth month, and many wandering cultivators and demons who had received invitations from the Green Lotus Fairy had arrived. The gathering was, to say the least, peculiar.  

Though Green Lotus Mountain lay within Nanyang Prefecture, the estate did not belong to the Great Li Kingdom—a fact that placed it beyond the jurisdiction of the local Demon-Suppression Bureau.
