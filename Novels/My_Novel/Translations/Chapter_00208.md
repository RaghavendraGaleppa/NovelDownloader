Chapter 208: Master and Husband, Sword-Breaking Madam

The heroes of the Wangzhen Tower were startled as Madam Wen displayed her talent. She ascended the tower step by step, defeating Bi Chunfu, killing a petty villain, and breaking Hu Bohong—all done cleanly and swiftly in merely half an hour.

As she continued upward to the third floor, where the high seats were, someone volunteered to test her skills. He used a bronze cauldron to block the staircase, causing an immediate uproar.

"It's the Cauldron-Back Freak! This man is overbearing and eccentric beyond belief. When did he get on the tower? None of us knew at all."

"It's said this man never leaves his cauldron; he eats, drinks, and relieves himself all within it. Though short in stature, he possesses immense strength. I heard that once on Daoxuan Mountain, a young girl insulted him, so he imprisoned her inside the cauldron and wouldn't let her out. It wasn't until the Daoxuan Mountain elders personally demanded her release that the matter was finally resolved."

Everyone was watching.

Wen Caishang remained composed. Walking toward the heavy cauldron blocking the way, she said softly, "Cauldron-Back Freak... I未必 (might not) challenge you, so why did you come to me?"

The Cauldron-Back Freak stood on the third floor, the large cauldron completely sealing the staircase. He teased her from behind it, "Hahaha, this old man just loves to play with women. Beautiful lady, oh beautiful lady, how about this? If you win, I will naturally step aside."

"If you lose to me, I will still step aside. But for the next few days, I ask that you enter my cauldron to stay for a few nights. We can chat about the heavens and the earth, exchange insights on martial arts, and have fun so great we won't want to leave. Wonderful, hahaha, truly wonderful."

Listening to his words, the crowd couldn't help but let their imaginations run wild. Such a stunning beauty, sharing a cauldron, intimate contact. The delight of it would be worth more than being an immortal. All showed infatuated expressions.

Wen Caishang smiled. "Little old man, to gamble with me, you lack a bit of strength."

"Hmph!" The Cauldron-Back Freak said, "Little lady, you show off a bit of dominance and think you are so powerful. Since that's the case, you won't be seeing the scenery of the third floor."

He slapped the bronze cauldron. The body of the cauldron shook violently, emitting a sharp sound. There were thirteen seats on the third floor, half of which were empty. This was entirely because the Cauldron-Back Freak acted domineeringly, blocking the staircase with his cauldron to intercept visitors.

On the second floor, there were over thirty seats. Among them, four or five people had enough strength and status to sit in the high seats of the third floor, to glimpse a better view and enjoy a serene environment.

But they were all blocked by the Cauldron-Back Freak. On the second floor were the Wind and Flower Sword—Zhang Xianhua, the Bone-Crushing Stele Hand—Zhao Ya, the Sighing Sun Scholar—Qi Kaiyan... These heroes, hearing his words, felt anger in their hearts but were helpless.

Wen Caishang lightly touched the bronze cauldron. The Cauldron-Back Freak let out a cold "Hmph," slapped the cauldron's ear, and the cauldron, taking the force, spun rapidly. With a "whooshing" wind, an extremely powerful suction force actually emerged!

Those with weaker internal energy, caught by the suction, would be pulled along with the cauldron. In an instant, they would spin hundreds of times before being flung back. It was terrifyingly powerful.

Several martial artists on the second floor had already experienced this move. They used every trick they had but found it hard to counter. The Cauldron-Back Freak's internal energy was immense, making it hard for others to reach his level.

Wen Caishang smiled. "A petty trick, little old man. I wouldn't mind sharing the cauldron with you, but do you dare?"

The Cauldron-Back Freak said, "Hahaha, what does this old monster dare not do? Even if a celestial fairy entered my precious cauldron, I would make her... Eh... This voice... it sounds a bit familiar?"

"Could it be... could it be... You..."

Madam Wen said, "Xiao Xian, use the 'Waves Unceasing' move of the Azure Blue Palm and strike here." She pointed to the cauldron's ear.

Li Xian channeled his internal energy, and mist filled the air. When he struck, it was as if a real giant wave surged forth.

The cauldron body shook slightly but didn't stagnate, still spinning rapidly.

However, from within the cauldron, there were occasional light tremors, and the sound of surging waves was faintly heard, as if water was stored inside.

After a moment, the cauldron's vibrations intensified. The sound of the waves grew louder, eventually taking on the momentum of a tsunami and wild waves.

With an "Ah!" the Cauldron-Back Freak flew backward and fell to the ground. With a "donglong" sound, the large cauldron tipped over, spilling a pool of clear water on the ground.

This scene was truly strange, leaving the onlookers completely baffled.

Where did the water in the cauldron come from? How could a yellow-haired youth's light palm strike cause the Cauldron-Back Freak to suffer such a great defeat?

Li Xian was also puzzled.

"So that's how it is, so that's how it is... To break the situation like this is possible." The Sighing Sun Scholar, Qi Kaiyan, holding a folding fan and fanning it gently, suddenly understood and saw the light.

The truth was...

The martial arts of the Jianghu are complex and extensive. Among them, there are no lack of countermeasures. The Cauldron-Back Freak used the 'Cauldron-Spinning Strength' to rotate the heavy cauldron. This martial art is very powerful. In this situation, eighty percent of martial arts could do nothing to him.

It was like a water vortex, blocking how many Jianghu heroes.

No matter how strong your swordsmanship or how immense your strength... moving this cauldron was completely impossible. The cauldron was thick and heavy, spinning rapidly, containing immense internal energy, secretly conforming to the cycle of the heavens, ceaseless and unending.

Whatever move struck it, it would receive, dissolve, and release. It had the tendency to simplify all martial arts into the mundane.

It truly hid profound martial principles.

However, there are people beyond people, and heavens beyond heavens. Wen Caishang's understanding of martial principles was deeper. She had Li Xian execute "Waves Unceasing" and strike the cauldron's ear.

"Waves Unceasing" originally consisted of ten palms, one after another, wave after wave. Used in succession, the waves never cease, hence the name.

Li Xian only executed one palm, raising the wave.

The palm force drilled into the cauldron. The spinning force inside, like a vortex, actually helped the palm's momentum, brewing the palm force. Like a wave being pushed back and forth, the momentum stacked, eventually turning into a great tidal wave.

The Cauldron-Back Freak was not defeated by Li Xian, but by himself. And even more so, he was defeated by Madam.

As for the water inside the cauldron...

Li Xian's martial arts were exceptionally realistic. Further compounded by the Cauldron-Back Freak constantly nurturing the momentum, the palm force underwent a qualitative change. It actually absorbed water vapor and turned it into water!

However... to break this move, there was another crucial requirement. The palm-striker needed to possess a "Perfect Appearance," or have a perfected palm technique, with internal energy having undergone a Second Transmutation.

Only then could the palm force and the strange phenomenon persist in the air for a long time, enduring and not dispersing.

Only then could it be brewed and its momentum increased.

"Admiration, truly admirable. This young woman's strength is profound and immeasurable." Qi Kaiyan saw through this point and sincerely praised.

Zhao Ya said, "The same principle. If I used the 'Black Water Iron Palm,' I could also break this cauldron technique. Unfortunately... at the time, I was focused on a head-on collision. I used all my hard palm techniques, trying to knock the cauldron away."

"Who exactly is this woman? Such knowledge, such appearance, such wisdom... she is definitely not an unknown person. And the young boy beside her, though young, just now that palm technique showed great attainment, his talent is not bad!" The Wind and Flower Sword, Zhang Xianhua, said.

The Cauldron-Back Freak exclaimed in shock, "Sword... Sword-Breaking Madam! You... you really have come!"

Wen Caishang said, "You remember me." She gracefully stepped onto the third floor. Her white skirt fluttered, her demeanor unmatched. Between her brows, she seemed both嗔 (angry) and gentle. But the softer her voice, the more it made the Cauldron-Back Freak tremble with fear.

Wen Caishang said, "Carry your broken cauldron and go. The Dragon Appreciation Banquet is imminent. On Senior Old Dragon's territory, I won't break my killing vow, to avoid bringing bad luck."

"Wen Caishang!" The Cauldron-Back Freak had contact with Madam over a decade ago. At that time, his Cauldron-Spinning Technique was not yet perfected, and he was easily broken by Wen Caishang.

Over a dozen years had passed. The Cauldron-Back Freak believed his technique was perfected. He sought people to fight, and the Cauldron-Spinning Technique remained unbroken. He was just starting to feel proud. He rushed to the Dragon Appreciation Banquet, knowing heroes gathered here, and thought: "I created the Cauldron-Spinning Technique myself, it's just right to let those heroes taste its flavor."

That's why he blocked the way with his cauldron, horizontally blocking the third-floor entrance. He defeated the Wind and Flower Sword, Zhao Ya, and others.

Who knew fate was a trickster, and he would eventually meet defeat. The moment Li Xian struck his palm, he knew the Sword-Breaking Madam had arrived.

But to save face, he was unwilling to lose again, refusing to believe he would lose again, and stubbornly held on. He continued to exert force to spin the cauldron. This only nurtured the palm's momentum, and in the end, he couldn't avoid a complete defeat.

The Cauldron-Back Freak's expression was ugly. "Although you broke my Cauldron-Spinning Technique, this move isn't my trump card. It's just a martial art I created myself; you exploited a loophole and got lucky. Hmph! Sword-Breaking Madam... you are indeed powerful, but over ten years have passed. How dare you say you can surely defeat me?!"

"Driving me out of Wangzhen Tower? Hmph! You underestimate me too much!"

Wen Caishang said calmly, "Little girl here is drinking tea. Seeing you really kills my appetite. I ask you to go out and avoid me. We both get peace. It can't be said that I'm driving you out of the tower."

The Cauldron-Back Freak's expression softened. "That's more like it. If you said that earlier, I'm not an unreasonable person. I would naturally accommodate you."

He carried the large cauldron on his back and walked down the stairs with dignity, intending to choose a seat on the second floor.

Wen Caishang said, "I can still smell your scent on the second floor. Please leave the tower."

The Cauldron-Back Freak cursed, "What a keen nose! Fine, fine. Women." He left the tower dejectedly. Turning the corner at the end of the street, he put down the large cauldron and let out a cold breath.

"What a perverted woman... she's gotten stronger... even stronger!" The Cauldron-Back Freak stroked the cauldron body and found a palm print on it.

Wen Caishang had lightly caressed it, leaving it behind. The palm contained momentum, and there was still a remnant of it. When the Cauldron-Back Freak touched it with his hand, there was a sudden "crack" as his hand bone shattered...

As if he had exchanged a palm strike with Wen Caishang.

"Palm force attached to the cauldron body,厉害 (powerful),厉害 (powerful)." The Cauldron-Back Freak shouldered his beloved cauldron and fled into the distance.

Inside Wangzhen Tower.

The name "Sword-Breaking Madam" spread, immediately causing a heated discussion. Many heroes, having heard the name late, didn't know of her. They asked around about Madam's deeds. However, those who truly knew Madam's prowess remained silent, not daring to speak recklessly.

On the third floor.

Madam Wen saw that nearly half the seats were empty. The space was spacious, open on all sides. A gentle breeze blew. Looking west, one could see a dark green forest.

One could see a black pool. Inside the pool was a python, about to transform into a flood dragon.

"Sword-Breaking Madam, it's a pleasure to meet you, a pleasure." A man in luxurious robes greeted her respectfully.

Wen Caishang returned the courtesy, pulled Li Xian over, and said, "Xiao Xian, why haven't you greeted the senior? His name is 'Hong Mu Ya,' his Jianghu title is the Tongmu Old Man."

Li Xian said respectfully, "Greetings, Senior Hong."

Hong Mu Ya said, "Hahaha, good lad, truly handsome. Madam Wen, may I ask if this is your... disciple?"

Wen Caishang smiled. "Yes and no."

Although Hong Mu Ya was curious, he didn't dare ask more. There were eight guests here, all strong experts from the Yu'nan Dao and Longxiong Dao areas.

The python and flood dragon would travel along the Hua River. Experts from both areas came either to appreciate the dragon or to slay it. But those who gathered in Longzhao Town were all "Guests of the Dragon Appreciation."

They considered each other companions.

That's why... Madam didn't break her killing vow. She only震死 (shocked to death) a petty villain to intimidate the heroes.

The Toad of Devouring Heaven Hand, Di Bin, walked over quickly and said respectfully, "With Madam presiding over this banquet, it seems we are already ten times more likely to succeed."

Wen Caishang said, "Hero Di overstates it. Caishang is a weak woman, how dare I take all the credit. You heroes are the main force of this banquet. Caishang is merely bringing my little boy to see the world."

Di Bin and Hong Mu Ya looked at each other, both thinking: "My little boy? I didn't expect the Sword-Breaking Madam, after disappearing for so long, to have a young boy beside her. I observe their relationship, it's like teacher and disciple but not, like master and servant but not... Could it be that he is both master and wife, both disciple and husband?"

They felt great curiosity, but as this was not a matter to offend Madam over, no one asked.

"Wen Senior, there are guest rooms upstairs. Please go up and rest." A voice came from upstairs.
