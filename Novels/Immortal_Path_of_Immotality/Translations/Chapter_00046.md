# Chapter 46: The Ultimate Victor

Lin Shan reached out to pluck the fruit, but as soon as his fingers touched it, the enhancement panel suddenly appeared:

[Water Spirit Fruit]
Quality: First-grade Spiritual Object
Description: One of the Five Elements Spirit Fruits, containing pure water spiritual energy. Consuming and refining it can slightly increase cultivation. Must be stored in jade immediately after picking to prevent gradual loss of spiritual energy.
Enhancement Cost: 8 points
...

"A first-grade spiritual object, Water Spirit Fruit, one of the Five Elements Spirit Fruits..." Lin Shan murmured to himself as he studied the enhancement panel, deep in thought.

It seemed the so-called "Innate Vermilion Fruit" was merely a mortal's term. These spirit fruits would develop different elemental attributes depending on their growing environment. Those in cold pools became Water Spirit Fruits, while those near volcanoes were likely Fire Spirit Fruits.

This reminded him of the Warm Sun Jade Pendant Thunderclap had given him earlier—also a first-grade spiritual object. This indicated that not only could crafting materials be enhanced, but alchemical ingredients could as well.

Since activating the enhancement panel, he had encountered items that could be enhanced in various categories: elixirs, cultivation techniques, martial arts, weapons, materials, and medicinal herbs. It appeared the enhancement panel covered all major aspects of the cultivation path.

"But if I can enhance elixirs directly, why bother with herbs? Wouldn't the former be more efficient?"

"If I need to refine certain elixirs but lack sufficiently aged ingredients, I could enhance the herbs to meet the required potency."

"Or even more drastically, take underaged herbs, forcibly refine a simplified version of the elixir, then enhance it into the genuine article?"

Lin Shan's thoughts wandered as he contemplated the various applications of the enhancement panel.

Snapping back to reality, he rummaged through Immortal Nan's storage pouch and indeed found several jade boxes. It seemed cultivators naturally understood how to store spirit fruits properly. Had he foolishly plucked it without preparation, the fruit would have lost all its spiritual energy by the time he returned, leaving only a pit.

Shaking his head, he carefully placed the Water Spirit Fruit into a jade box and stored it away. After scanning the area and finding nothing else of value, he grimaced at the thought of retracing his path. Killing the fish was one thing, but dog-paddling back through the water was another ordeal.

After leaving the unnamed island, Lin Shan reunited with Chief Jiang and the other Nightingale assassins. They found several empty boats nearby and returned to Dongting Lake.

The Nightingale branch leader from Jiangling invited Lin Shan to visit their headquarters, which he gladly accepted—he had been planning to do so anyway.

Now with time to inquire, Lin Shan learned that the Jiangling leader, surnamed Yang, had come to Dongting at the Triple Head Dock's invitation. The dock had offered a substantial bounty for the twelve Xiantian-level leaders of the Twelve Linked Docks, and Leader Yang was simply fulfilling the contract.

It was said that the Twelve Linked Docks had been completely eradicated. Their chief leader, originally at the peak of Xiantian realm, had been personally slain by Immortal Nan before Lin Shan's arrival.

---

After everyone finished exterminating the Twelve Linked Docks' pirates, they turned on each other. This explained why the final battlefield had no trace of the hosts themselves.

Regarding the Innate Vermilion Fruit, Lin Shan simply mentioned there had only been one. Chief Jiang naturally deflated at this and didn't press further.

Throughout the journey, Leader Yang showered Lin Shan with effusive praise, his flattery flowing endlessly yet artfully, never crossing into obsequiousness. Lin Shan, who had never been so lavishly complimented in his life—especially by a Xiantian expert—found himself nodding along, thoroughly pleased. He increasingly felt that Leader Yang was a remarkable individual—meticulous, reliable, capable in combat, and skilled in flattery.

Such a rare talent seemed wasted in Jiangling. Lin Shan couldn't help but glance at Chief Jiang beside him, making silent comparisons.

Chief Jiang, meanwhile, was thoroughly disgruntled. Watching Leader Yang grow closer to Lin Shan, he felt an inexplicable sourness. The more he looked at Leader Yang, the more the man resembled a scheming opportunist.

Lin Shan, however, thought otherwise. What opportunist? This was clearly an understanding and admirable branch leader.

Seizing the moment, Leader Yang expressed his longing for immortality and hoped Lin Shan could guide him. Having just basked in the man's praise, Lin Shan couldn't bring himself to refuse. He vaguely promised to test Leader Yang for spiritual roots once they reached the Jiangling branch, claiming the procedure required specific conditions.

Overjoyed, Leader Yang immediately fetched a stool for Lin Shan on the boat, offering massages and foot rubs.

What he didn't know was that Lin Shan had no idea how to test for spiritual roots—his own discovery had been pure luck.

---

The fleet crossed Dongting Lake and returned to the great river, docking south of Jiangling as dawn broke.

Leader Yang led the group into Jiangling City under the dim morning light.

Arriving at the Nightingale branch, Lin Shan was astonished to find their headquarters built entirely underground. The organization had excavated a massive subterranean complex spanning half a square mile, with ceilings over twenty feet high. The central area featured a vast circular plaza teeming with people.

Descending further, Lin Shan saw rows of buildings housing bustling businesses—gambling dens, brothels, tea houses, black markets—with patrons ranging from commoners to nobility.

"All this belongs to the Nightingales?" Lin Shan asked incredulously.

Leader Yang smiled. "Not exactly. We provide the venue and lease the spaces to merchants. We collect rent."

Lin Shan eyed the massive crowds, silently calculating the profits. Truly, beneath Jiangling's surface prosperity lay another layer of thriving commerce.

Leader Yang led them through the crowds to a cavern deeper within. After several hundred meters, they reached a smaller area where only Nightingale assassins in black robes moved about—the true branch headquarters.

After settling Lin Shan in his quarters, Leader Yang tactfully withdrew to let him rest. Lin Shan, now secure in his safety, began organizing his gains from the previous night.

Though news of his acquisition of the Innate Vermilion Fruit had likely spread among Jiangling's elite, assembling another force like yesterday's—dozens of Xiantian experts and hundreds of martial artists—was no simple feat. Xiantian experts were influential figures who wouldn't risk themselves lightly.

Opening Immortal Nan's storage pouch, Lin Shan found eight spirit stones—half metal-attribute, half fire-attribute. Two booklets contained metal and fire cultivation techniques, which held little interest for him. He currently possessed techniques for five elements (metal, wood, fire, earth, wind), but only the wind technique was useful to him.

Finally, he examined the jade slip inside. Inscribed with the words "Introduction to the Cultivation World," it contained a wealth of foundational knowledge, clearly written by a senior for a junior's education. These were precisely the basics Lin Shan desperately needed, as he was currently completely ignorant about the cultivation world.
