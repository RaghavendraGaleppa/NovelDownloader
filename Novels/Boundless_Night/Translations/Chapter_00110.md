Chapter 110: Mountain River Spirit Nest

"Mountain River Spirit Nest, what kind of place is that?" Qin Ming asked, surprised.

He helped Li Qingyue, searching through this land brimming with vitality.

"It was originally formed naturally. With a bit of arrangement, it can become a miraculous land. Some can grow rare medicinal herbs, while others are ancestral burial grounds favored by royalty, used for relocating ancestral tombs..."

Li Qingyue spoke as she walked. Her originally delicate and flawless face was now somewhat pale, and her silver armor was severely damaged, with little left. For instance, only her left shoulder remained covered by armor plates, revealing her fair forearm. Her entire armor was riddled with cracks and stained with blood, possessing a sort of broken beauty.

Li Qingyue was heavily injured. Not only was her silver armor shattered, but even the golden robe beneath, inscribed with life-saving runes, was broken and completely dim. Qin Ming took out the medicine Tang Xumi had given him and asked if she could take it and if it would be effective for her injuries.

Li Qingyue shook her head. She had already taken spiritual medicine, but the effect was not significant. This time, she had barely escaped death, and the divine radiance within her Yellow Court had almost extinguished. The spiritual light formed by her consciousness was flickering like a candle flame, no longer as brilliant as a blazing sun.

***

Outside the Luofu Immortal Mountain ruins, Meng Xinghai felt a strong sense of unease. He increasingly suspected that someone wanted to "arrange" Li Qingyue's elimination, or even endanger her.

Sure enough, as some blood-stained golden-armored guards and elite Outer Realm disciples fled, the situation inside gradually became clear. Many were shocked that the five core disciples had joined forces in the White Bamboo Forest to severely wound Li Qingyue, causing her to suffer a great loss of vitality and completely losing her qualification to compete for the near-immortal artifact.

"At least ten golden-armored guards died by Li Ye's hand, but he himself was bleeding heavily, severely wounded, and his protective runes have extinguished."

Upon hearing these reports, Meng Xinghai's expression turned grim. The situation for those two was precarious. Under such circumstances, if anyone were to intercept them again, they would truly be in danger.

"This is truly too dark!" How could he not see that this was "arranged"? From the very beginning, Li Qingyue had been feared by all the core disciples. Before entering the "Spirit Cave," they had already secretly communicated.

Many lamented that Li Qingyue, who originally had the greatest hope of acquiring that legendary item, was eliminated in this manner. An old man sighed, "It was truly not easy for her this time. To be able to survive and break out under the siege of the five core disciples is enough to prove herself."

Although the waters were murky, some were able to see clearly, knowing that there were some tricks involved and sensing a hint of danger. A middle-aged man in feather robes, emanating an otherworldly aura, spoke, "Even if she doesn't obtain the near-immortal item, Li Qingyue has established her prestige among this generation. Just based on today's battle achievements, how many will dare to defy her in the future?"

"It's still regrettable. If she had obtained that item this time, it wouldn't have been impossible for her to become a leader of the Outer Realm in the future."

Others, with faint smiles, said, "Talking about that is useless. Li Qingyue is already out!"

In the cities throughout the Night Fog World, many gamblers wailed again, feeling that it was too much of a scam. Even the most authoritative Night Report had become an "accomplice," misleading them.

"Mountain God, destroy it! I don't want to live anymore!"

***

"Some of those miraculous lands became Spirit Nests, some transformed into ancestral burial grounds, and some condensed into baleful apertures..." Li Qingyue slowly explained to Qin Ming.

This vibrant land was lush with vegetation, with cinnabar cliffs and strange rocks, the scenery remarkably outstanding. Streams formed by converging fire springs snaked through the mountains, nourishing this spiritually abundant area.

"Truly magnificent!" Qin Ming exclaimed. In front, a waterfall at least a thousand *zhang* long cascaded down, crystal clear, radiating crimson light that illuminated the splendid mountains and rivers. A fire spring forming a waterfall would undoubtedly be the rarest resource in the outside world, prompting the construction of a grand city around it. Yet here, it was merely a scenic view.

"As expected of a former top-tier Blessed Land."

Qin Ming gazed, observing many similar wonders, with high-grade fire springs being relatively dense. No wonder, a thousand years ago, the great figures of the Outer Realm wanted to attempt to elevate this place into a Grotto-Heaven.

"Are there any Grotto-Heavens in the Night Fog World?" Qin Ming asked.

"To my knowledge, such a realm does not yet exist," Li Qingyue replied. "Luofu Immortal Mountain has the quality of a Grotto-Heaven, but it's not yet time for its transformation."

"There are carvings from the Patriarch here. Let's follow this path," Li Qingyue said, touching the moss-covered stone wall. Suddenly, she stumbled, nearly falling, a clear indication of how severe her injuries were.

Qin Ming quickly steadied her again, a worried expression on his face. He asked, "With such heavy injuries, your Sea of Consciousness and Yellow Court won't have any problems, will they?"

"Once we find the Spirit Nest, these are nothing. They aren't doing well either; two of them were almost killed by me, and the other three are also seriously injured," Li Qingyue said.

Qin Ming couldn't help but sigh. Time truly changed everything. The graceful young girl of the past had now grown to such an extent, capable of slaying Outer Realm core disciples. Her path to rise was formidable. He was dissatisfied with himself, even wanting to sigh. He, too, was severely injured, but his opponents weren't renowned figures; only Tan Yu had been mentioned.

He Tai, with the demeanor of a young sect master; Chen Shuhang, who cultivated the Five-Colored Thunderfire Force; Jiang Congyun, a disciple of Pure Yang Palace; the mysterious successor of the Five Elements Palace; and the nominal disciple of the Yuqing lineage—these were the truly formidable figures, all having cultivated the top-tier Heavenly Light Force. Tan Yu was merely mentioned in passing, fusing over ten types of Heavenly Light Force during the Newborn stage. But then again, who with any foundation didn't?

"I'm still not strong enough!" Qin Ming sighed, feeling that if he were to face those formidable individuals, he would surely perish here.

Li Qingyue spoke, "Don't be self-deprecating. You're already very powerful. You've only undergone five rebirths, yet you can already slay Outer Saints. Those people all have powerful Dao lineages behind them, cultivated meticulously, and have long since stepped into the Outer Saint realm. I believe you can quickly close the gap and surpass them."

Since his body's rebirth, Qin Ming had progressed smoothly, integrating various Heavenly Light Forces, and had even single-handedly annihilated Golden Rooster Ridge, achieving impressive feats. Yet, upon arriving here, he found it difficult to contend with opponents from major factions.

"I need to work hard to improve myself!" he said, nodding.

The main reason was Li Qingyue as a comparison. She could slay some of the strongest core disciples of the Outer Realm, while Qin Ming had only dealt with unknown individuals.

"Oh, we should be close," Li Qingyue said with joy, brilliant divine light swirling in her eyes as she gazed forward with a mysterious pupil technique.

"Over there!" she pointed the way.

***

This area was covered with golden maple trees, their leaves a translucent yellow, further illuminated by fire springs, making it an excellent place to build a hermitage. Qin Ming supported Li Qingyue as they traversed the forest where golden leaves drifted down, arriving before a stone mountain that had no soil and no vegetation. Carved steps led up the stone mountain to its halfway point, with a very steep incline.

"This is the place. I hope this Spirit Nest is usable," Li Qingyue said, having spotted the Patriarch's markings on the stone mountain.

Qin Ming supported her as they ascended the steep mountain, reaching the halfway point where they saw a closed stone door.

"There's movement in the distance!"

"Li Qingxu!"

They spotted Li Qingxu's figure on a distant peak. He was confronting Tathagata's Abandoned Disciple, Xiang Yiwu, and it seemed they had just exchanged blows.

"A persistent specter. He must know you're injured and has followed us all this way, trying to take advantage?" Qin Ming stared into the distance.

Li Qingyue said, "It's not necessarily for revenge. He might have heard that my Patriarch made arrangements here and also wants to enter the Spirit Nest." Although this matter was very secretive, Li Qingxu's master held a very high status and was qualified to access some sealed documents, perhaps having discovered clues.

Qin Ming said, "Xiang Yiwu is truly formidable; he actually blocked Li Qingxu." His expression was solemn. If this abandoned disciple of Tathagata weren't nearby, he and Li Qingyue might have faced a crisis. This trip to the Spirit Cave was far more dangerous than he had imagined.

Li Qingxu vanished, ultimately not engaging in a major battle with Xiang Yiwu.

Qin Ming whispered, "I'll go see Xiang Yiwu and ask him for a favor, to temporarily block Li Qingxu for us. If that guy barges in at a crucial moment, things will get very bad."

Li Qingyue nodded. Over time, it was indeed possible for Li Qingxu to find this place.

***

Not long after, Qin Ming and Xiang Yiwu met again. Before Qin Ming could speak, the Tathagata's Abandoned Disciple complained, "What is this situation? After meeting you, I always have to face core disciples from the Outer Realm. It's truly a bit dangerous."

"I'll give you the Lihuo Classic in advance, but you have to help me block that Li Qingxu. I trust your character."

When Xiang Yiwu heard this, his bell-like eyes immediately lit up, and his spirits rose. "That's truly great! I'm always clear about favors and grievances. If someone respects me an inch, I'll return a yard. I'll never let you suffer a loss. I have a copy of the *Wuji Classic* here, which is even more precious than your wondrous *Lihuo Classic*."

As soon as Qin Ming heard the name of this scripture, he knew it was extraordinary, undoubtedly of great origin. The characters "Wuji" (戊己) were enough to explain everything.

Next, Qin Ming recited the scripture. Xiang Yiwu closed his eyes, listening intently, actually silently memorizing it.

"This is an entire book; can you memorize it word for word?" Qin Ming was surprised by his talent.

Xiang Yiwu explained, "After a Newborn steps into the Outer Saint realm, they can initially use some spiritual light from their consciousness. My sect has a secret method that allows one to temporarily imprint heard words into their mind for several days. Since there's no paper or pen now, I can only awkwardly memorize it using this method for now."

"Are you really an abandoned disciple?" Qin Ming didn't quite believe it.

"You treated me with sincerity first, by giving me the Lihuo Classic, so naturally, I won't hide anything from you. I'm not really an abandoned disciple; I'm just 'free-ranged.' The competition within the sect is too fierce, so I've become 'wild.' The elders want to expand the Tathagata Law and have tried many paths; I'm trying one of them."

Xiang Yiwu sighed. How far he could go depended entirely on his own struggle. According to the elders, anyone who achieved success first had to temper their will through hardship; staying on the spiritual mountain would only lead to becoming useless.

He said, "If I fail, I'm an abandoned disciple. If I succeed, and surpass my fellow disciples, then one day I can return and become a Tathagata."

"I wish you success in becoming a Tathagata!" Qin Ming laughed.

Xiang Yiwu shook his head and sighed, "I wouldn't dare to think that. Some of my senior brothers are too terrifying. I'm still far from it. Alas, being 'wild' with no one to nurture you is truly difficult."

After memorizing the Lihuo Classic, he began reciting the Wuji Classic for Qin Ming.

Qin Ming stopped him, saying, "Why don't you recite the scripture while demonstrating the movements? Be serious and focused, and I'll learn from you." He hadn't yet entered the Outer Saint realm, nor did he possess Xiang Yiwu's sect's secret method, so quick memorization was impossible. The only way was through spiritual resonance.

Xiang Yiwu nodded and began reciting the scripture and demonstrating the wondrous technique there. Qin Ming's mind was highly concentrated. This time, the effect was excellent, allowing him to thoroughly grasp the true essence of the Wuji Classic.

"You're still a Newborn, yet you can memorize it so quickly?" Xiang Yiwu had expected to recite the scripture many times, not realizing that just one time would be enough. The way he looked at Qin Ming was just like how Qin Ming had looked at him earlier—he was equally astonished.

"I've roughly memorized it. If I still don't understand, I'll ask you for guidance later," Qin Ming said.

Not long after, he returned to the stone mountain. Li Qingyue used a special spiritual light of consciousness to shake the stone door, then opened the entrance to the place. Contrary to expectations, the air inside was not stale; instead, it was very fresh, accompanied by wisps of spiritual light rising.

Li Qingyue said, "This place connects to the Ancestral Earth Vein, making its spiritual energy significantly denser than many other Blessed Lands." Soon, she revealed a look of joy, feeling her damaged spiritual light of consciousness begin to activate, no longer so dim.

"Hmm?!" Qin Ming discovered that as soon as he stepped in, his spiritual energy surged, seemingly improving slowly, about to undergo some kind of transformation.
