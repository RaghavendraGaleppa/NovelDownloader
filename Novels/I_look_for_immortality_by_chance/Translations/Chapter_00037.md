# Chapter 37: Just a Low-Grade Demon Beast  

**Boom!**  

The deafening roar of water filled the air as Gu Yuan descended into the fifth layer of the Yunya Shell Field. A towering, murky wave crashed down toward him the moment he landed.  

Gu Yuan stood his ground, unmoving. His Daoist robe shimmered with a faint cyan glow, as if an invisible barrier had formed before him, effortlessly dispersing the force of the wave.  

Moreover, an unseen force field spread beneath his feet, revealing a patch of dry ground, ensuring his footing remained clean and undisturbed.  

"This mid-grade Daoist robe is proving useful. The fifth layer hasn’t been completely submerged by the water veins yet. Though the waves are fierce, maintaining this for three days shouldn’t be a problem."  

Gu Yuan examined his pristine robe and mused quietly.  

The fifth layer of the Yunya Shell Field hadn’t yet been fully overtaken by the great river’s currents. The water level only reached knee height, with occasional surges rising as high as a person.  

Glancing around, he noted the cave entrance was roughly twice a man’s height, with walls no more than three zhang wide. Cracks riddled the stone surfaces, and waves crashed incessantly, yet an inexplicable dry heat permeated the depths of the cavern.  

"Where water veins run so deep, yet fire still lingers within the cliffs—yin and yang in harmony. No wonder this place can birth shell jade."  

Gu Yuan ran his fingers along the cliff face, feeling the arid texture, and couldn’t help but murmur to himself.  

Despite the relentless waves battering the walls, not a single droplet clung to the stone. The moment the water receded, the surface dried instantly.  

Truly a mystical place.  

Yet, recalling the sheer depth of these cliffs, Gu Yuan couldn’t suppress a sigh.  

"The golden opportunity lies deep within the water veins—likely beyond even the ninth layer. At my current strength, forget about potential demon beasts, the water pressure alone would crush me to death."  

"Even that half-silver opportunity is in the sixth layer, which still poses risks for me now. For the time being, I’ll have to scour the fifth layer first and strengthen myself as quickly as possible."  

The Yunya Shell Field was divided into nine layers, each a separate shell-producing region. The shell jade found here could enhance cultivation from the first to the ninth level of Qi Refinement.  

The Shell Kings, in particular, could directly help a cultivator break through their current realm.  

However, one could only consume a single Shell King. Even if a prodigy descended from the first layer all the way to the ninth, they couldn’t leap nine realms in a single night to reach the peak of Qi Refinement.  

Thus, this place was most suitable for late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.  

But with an opportunity before him, Gu Yuan couldn’t afford to hesitate. Every breakthrough counted.  

While a fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivator could technically descend to the sixth layer, the sixth layer was entirely submerged by the great river’s currents. The water veins were dense, forcing cultivators to constantly expend spiritual energy to repel the water pressure—or be crushed to death.  

For a sixth-level Qi Refinement cultivator, it was manageable, but at the fifth level, it was a struggle.  

Moreover, dangers lurked within the Shell Field.  

Thus, to safely enter the sixth layer, it was best to first break through to the sixth level of Qi Refinement.  

For others, this would be difficult, but Gu Yuan already held the advantage.  

He had used the Stone Liquid to scout the area, familiarizing himself with the locations of the shell jade and Shell Kings. Barring unforeseen circumstances, he could swiftly gather the jade, seize the Shell King, and advance to the sixth level.  

Then, he could explore the sixth layer.  

No matter what, securing that half-silver opportunity came first.  

The previous Four Spirit Jade Pillars had not only helped him break through the极品灵识关 (top-grade spiritual sense barrier) but also granted him immense potential for Foundation Building.  

This half-strand of silver light, second only to the Four Spirit Jade Pillars, was surely no ordinary treasure.  

With this in mind, Gu Yuan wasted no time and strode deeper into the cavern.  

With every step he took, the water parted beneath his feet. Though waves surged around him, his robes remained dry, his demeanor as composed as an immortal’s.  

---  

The Yunya Shell Field was famed for its nine layers and countless caverns. The entire solitary peak resembled a honeycomb, riddled with innumerable cave entrances.  

The internal structure was even more complex—a labyrinth of tunnels where dozens or even hundreds of people could vanish without a trace.  

Yet, at this moment, fierce combat echoed from a secluded cave.  

**"Screech! Screech!"**  

A massive, ink-black ape, standing over ten feet tall with a long crimson tail, clung to the cliff wall. Its blood-red eyes glared fixedly at the Daoist before it.  

Waves crashed between them like a strange curtain separating the two.  

**"Bang!"**  

Suddenly, the demonic ape let out a piercing shriek. Its crimson tail lashed out like a steel whip, tearing through the waves and striking toward the Daoist’s head.  

At the same time, eerie patterns on its chest lit up, forming a ghostly face that abruptly opened its eyes and shot forth a beam of black light, reeking of foulness, aimed directly at the Daoist’s forehead.  

The black light was terrifyingly fast, arriving before the tail strike.  

**"Splash—"**  

But the sound of water rippled through the air as an ink-black tortoise shell materialized, blocking the black light at the last possible moment.  

**"Clang!"**  

The impact rang like metal striking metal, followed by a sizzling noise.  

The two forces locked in a stalemate, neither advancing nor retreating.  

Yet the crimson tail, carrying a vicious gale, was already upon him.  

The air shrieked as the tail whipped forward with the force of ten thousand jin—far surpassing the strength of a fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivator.  

**"Lock!"**  

The Daoist merely uttered a single word.  

**"Clatter—"**  

An ice-blue seal materialized, channeling spiritual energy into chains as thick as a fist. Frost radiated from them as they coiled around the ape’s crimson tail, freezing it mid-air and rendering it immobile.  

**"Screech! Screech!"**  

The cold seeped into the demon ape’s body, stiffening its movements, but its eyes only grew more ferocious. Its abdomen bulged, as if something monstrous was gathering within.  

But before it could unleash its attack, a pale, slender hand thrust forward, piercing its throat with a cyan Daoist sword.  

**"Gurgle—"**  

The ape clutched its wound, choking helplessly before collapsing lifelessly.  

"Red-Tailed Apes are intelligent demon beasts—they don’t fight so recklessly. Could this be the doing of the Azurefire Golden-Eyed Ape clan?"  

The Daoist—none other than Gu Yuan—eyed the beast’s contorted, lifeless face with suspicion.  

He had taken the most direct route to gather shell jade, knowing their precise locations. Yet the very first piece was guarded by this Red-Tailed Ape.  

According to the *Nanshan Domain Records*, "Red-Tailed Apes are aquatic demon beasts of the great rivers, intelligent and adept at avoiding danger. They often serve as guardians of shell fields."  

But the one Gu Yuan encountered was savage and fearless, showing no trace of its supposed cautious nature.  

Hence, he suspected the Azurefire Golden-Eyed Apes might be behind this.  

After all, they wouldn’t surrender the Shell Field without a fight. Even if they dared not openly oppose the Daoist Academy, they’d surely resort to underhanded tactics.  

"Still, what does it matter if a Red-Tailed Ape fights recklessly? It’s just a low-grade demon beast."  

Gu Yuan shook his head.  

Low-grade demon beasts were, at most, equivalent to fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivators.  

**"Screech! Screech! Screech!"**  

But just then, shrill cries erupted from all directions.  

Gu Yuan looked up to see four or five ink-black apes, their crimson tails dragging behind them, charging toward him with blood-red eyes, frenzied like rabid dogs.  

His expression stiffened, and he cursed under his breath:  

"Damn it all!"
