# Chapter 46: The Second Cave

"Seems like there are human footprints on the ground. Should we report this?" On the main peak of the Mad Demon Cave, a mountain rat demon was alert, communicating with his companions.

"Why bother? Even those oversea visitors haven't reacted," a cat demon nearby said. "We're just low-level workers. Don't stand out too much."

Their job was simply to keep watch as ordered.

"But why don't they use birds for sentry duty instead?" the rat demon wondered.

"That's the Great King's wisdom—not something we should question. Come on, let's find a place to rest." The cat demon suggested the rat demon not be so diligent.

By a conspicuous tree near the Mad Demon Cave.

"What in the world is that?" Song Yuanbao stared warily at the thing hanging from the tree branch, his hand ready to draw his blade. "It's even snoring."

It wasn’t his fault for being startled. As a seasoned constable, he had attended the county's Demon Suppression Bureau training sessions. Every year, he participated in the constables' experience-sharing conference and returned with a copy of *The Complete Guide to Recognizing Demons Across Nations*. He would then share what he learned with his colleagues.

These manuals were jointly published by various nations. Regardless of whether they were at war, this cooperative tradition persisted—after all, conflicts between nations were internal disputes, while demons were the common enemy.

Fighting among family was one thing, but outsiders were an entirely different matter.

Vigilance against external threats had to remain constant, and methods had to keep up with the times.

New types of demons emerged every year, each more bizarre than the last. Understanding them was crucial for effective countermeasures.

Song Yuanbao was tense, excited, and curious—his emotions were a tangled mess—because he didn’t recognize the creature before him.

"Don’t poke it with that stick…" Xiao Ji stopped Song Yuanbao’s reckless action. "I underestimated that bear demon. It’s far more cunning than I thought… We’re in the wrong place."

Xiao Ji examined the koala demon, realizing it was merely a decoy.

Killing it, moving it, or even causing it distress would trigger some form of demonic energy, alerting the horde to their presence.

"Wrong place?" Song Yuanbao was, as usual, confused.

"Yes, we came to the wrong mountain," Xiao Ji explained. "The tracks, footprints, scents, and even the demons’ droppings we followed were deliberately placed to lead us astray."

"And this creature? It’s a pawn the bear demon discarded—probably because it was too useless."

"A diversion?" Song Yuanbao hadn’t expected mountain demons to evolve so quickly. In the past, they were nothing but brutes who relied on sheer force.

Under Xiao Ji’s guidance, the group weaved through the traps set by the mountain demons and left the small peak, heading toward another mountain.

Xiao Ji’s perception range was already considerable, but navigating the wilderness still cost them time.

He wished his sensory range could extend dozens of miles—then tracking would be as easy as reaching into a bag.

Only after finding the correct path did Xiao Ji relax. If he failed this time, the responsibility would weigh heavily on him—after all, it was his idea to release the bear demon and eradicate the entire human-trafficking demon gang.

"What exactly was that thing? Never seen anything like it," Song Yuanbao couldn’t stop thinking about the strange creature. "If we captured it and handed it over to the Demon Suppression Bureau, our Willow Town constabulary would surely be commended."

Xiao Ji knew that unless he explained the koala thoroughly, the square-faced constable wouldn’t let it go. He’d keep nagging, possibly even ruining everyone’s sleep.

"Koala. An overseas species. Big head, but not smart. Round ears, but average hearing. Big black nose, but ordinary sense of smell. No tail. Sleeps up to ten hours a day—in trees, just like you saw. Nocturnal. Moves very slowly… Oh, and it’s a herbivore. Likes chewing on twigs."

Xiao Ji gave Song Yuanbao and the other constables a quick lesson.

"Sleeps that much?" Song Yuanbao remarked. "It’s the laziest demon I’ve ever heard of. No wonder the bear demon used it as a decoy."

"You haven’t met a sloth demon yet," Xiao Ji replied.

To stop Song Yuanbao from asking more, Xiao Ji signaled for silence, and the group advanced quietly.

After a while…

"Master Xiao, let me ask one more thing," Song Yuanbao whispered as he moved closer. "How do you know so much?"

Since meeting the priest from the Primordial Temple, Song Yuanbao’s worldview had been constantly reshaped. His long-held knowledge had undergone a massive collapse.

Xiao Ji thought for a moment before answering seriously, "My master is extraordinary. He carries stories spanning hundreds of thousands of years in his mind. I learned everything from him."

Song Yuanbao nodded silently.

He had met the old master of the Primordial Temple before—an unassuming old man who loved chess, often playing and arguing with other elders. Who would’ve thought beneath that ordinary appearance lay such vast wisdom?

Truly, appearances could be deceiving. He’d have to butter up the old man next time.

"My master likes tea—green tea," Xiao Ji added. "And meat, doesn’t matter if it’s fatty or lean… Basically, he enjoys gifts."

The message was clear: next time Song Yuanbao visited the Primordial Temple, aside from donating coins and burning incense, he should bring presents.

It was the truth. Xiao Ji still remembered the first time he returned from the Ancient City with a book for his master. The old man was displeased and gave him the cold shoulder for days. If not for the roasted chicken Xiao Ji bought later, the silent treatment might have lasted even longer.

The Second Cave of the Mad Demon Cave.

Outside the entrance lurked numerous savage demonic beasts and sinister spirits—some hiding behind trees, some buried underground, others concealed in snowdrifts.

They guarded the cave, ensuring its security.

If enemies approached, they would assess the threat and decide whether to fight or flee.

More often than not, demons with intelligence were likelier to betray their own kind.

This was evident from how many sects and nobles in major cities kept demons as pets—traitors were everywhere.

The Second Cave was where the bear demon had arranged this transaction.

If a cunning rabbit had three burrows, then a bear having two caves wasn’t excessive, was it?

Inside the cave, the deal was underway.

A stone table separated two groups of demons.

On the table lay an assortment of bloody food and wine.

Despite the spread, only two were eating—the leaders on each side: a bear demon and an eagle demon.

"Brother Bear, transporting this many humans is troublesome," said the harpy, plucking a feather to pick his teeth while crossing his legs. "You’ll have to lower the price."
