# Chapter 154: The Elixir of Longevity Nears Completion, Tribulation Arrives

In the mortal realm, at Qingfu Palace.

Zhou Qing and Fushan began their attempt to refine the Elixir of Longevity—the Purple Longevity Elixir. After years of research, they had modified the ancient formula to some extent. Originally intended for Nascent Soul cultivators to extend their lifespan, the Purple Longevity Elixir required forty-nine years to refine and demanded power and techniques beyond Zhou Qing's current capabilities as a first-turn Golden Core cultivator.

Fortunately, the Purple Longevity Elixir shared a lineage with the Jade Liquid Restoration Pill formula. With materials prepared and discussions with Fushan, a genius in alchemy, Zhou Qing started experimenting with similar ingredients to refine a simpler version of the longevity elixir. Using his Insightful Void Eye, he observed the reactions and changes during the process to simulate the true refinement of the Purple Longevity Elixir.

During their experiments, Xiao Ruowang arrived with a new issue concerning the spirit fields. As the cultivation of spirit rice expanded in the mortal realm, the yield increased significantly. Farmers, using monster beast flesh and spirit stone fragments, produced high-quality spirit fertilizers, even cultivating Dragon Tooth Rice—a variety that matured once every five years, yielding only ten pounds per acre. Despite its low output, Dragon Tooth Rice far surpassed the effects of premium Dragon Grain Rice, greatly enhancing the foundation of Qi and blood for Foundation Establishment and Crucible cultivators, with some benefits even for Golden Core cultivators. Regular consumption promised further physical transformation.

However, a problem arose: locusts had consumed some of the Dragon Tooth Rice during its growth, evolving into a formidable mother locust that caused a severe plague, reducing the spirit rice yield. Despite efforts by Xiao Ruowang and his disciples, the locusts, capable of flight and burrowing, proved difficult to eradicate. Left with no choice, Xiao Ruowang sought Zhou Qing's help.

Recognizing the importance of the spirit fields to the Dao Court's long-term plans, Zhou Qing acted swiftly. He summoned his companions—Morning Sun, the Earth Armored Dragon, and Fushan—to the fields. Fushan, having cultivated the Bear Roar Golden Bell Scripture and refined the Primordial Earth Qi given by Zhou Qing, possessed an abundance of earth-attribute energy, making him an ideal bait to lure the locusts.

Under Zhou Qing's guidance, Fushan unleashed his energy, attracting swarms of locusts. Zhou Qing then used his Azure Sun Divine Fire to incinerate them, while Morning Sun and the little snake feasted on the pests. The Earth Armored Dragon, immune to the locusts' toxins, devoured those emerging from the ground. Zhou Qing's Golden Core domain, spanning five hundred zhang, ensured none escaped.

The mother locust, a formidable earth-attribute spirit beast, engaged Fushan in battle. After a fierce fight, Fushan subdued it and proposed using it for demonic seeding—a risky but potentially rewarding method to enhance his cultivation. Zhou Qing, having studied demonic seeding extensively, supported Fushan's ambition, especially with Lin Wan'er's Spirit Flight Melodic Scripture to stabilize his mind.

With the locust plague resolved, Zhou Qing refocused on refining the Purple Longevity Elixir. Over fifteen years, he balanced alchemy with cultivation, honing his Yin-Yang Divine Light to temper his Golden Core and spiritual sense. His spiritual sense advanced to the late Golden Core stage, and he reached the peak of his first Golden Core turn, nearing the second.

As the elixir neared completion, the heavens responded. The intense gathering of spiritual energy drew attention from afar, including the White Moon Wolf Tribe's sacred grounds, where the imprisoned Howling Moon Demon Lord sensed the elixir's aura and ordered its retrieval at any cost.

The tribulation had arrived.
