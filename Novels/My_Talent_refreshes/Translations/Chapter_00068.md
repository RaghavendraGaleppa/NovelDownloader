# Chapter 68: Chu Ning's Mission

Liao Yunming spoke up from the side:  
"Chu Ning, with other senior disciples participating in the sect's unified mission, our Spirit Plantation and Talisman Pavilion are short-handed. The sect has ordered us to assign some disciples to take over shifts at various marketplaces. But after much deliberation, we still couldn't find anyone suitable for Yanji Market. After discussing with Steward He, we agreed that since you're skilled in both cultivation and talisman-making, you'd be the perfect candidate—one person covering two roles."

"Hmm?" Chu Ning, who had been filled with anxiety and unease, was momentarily stunned.  
This seemed different from what he'd imagined?

Cautiously, he asked, "Stewards, are you saying this mission involves going to an external marketplace?"

"Yes, what else did you think it was?" He Changyou chuckled. "With your current cultivation level, you couldn't handle more complicated tasks anyway."

Hearing this, Chu Ning finally let out a quiet sigh of relief in his heart.  
He had misunderstood—false alarm!  
He had thought it was that life-threatening secret mission.  

Now relaxed, Chu Ning grew more curious about the marketplace assignment and inquired in detail. Soon, he understood the full picture.  

From their explanation, it seemed the sect needed more Qi Refinement disciples than initially expected. As a result, many disciples at the sixth level of Qi Refinement and above, originally stationed at external marketplaces or cultivation families, were recalled. Some were to participate in the sect's unified mission, while others were to fill gaps in the outer sect and among miscellaneous disciples.  

This, however, left a shortage of personnel in various external locations. After all, apart from the sect's mountain headquarters, Qingxi Sect also managed marketplaces and spirit fields elsewhere.  

The Yanji Market they mentioned was one such place.  

According to their introduction, Yanji Market was located at the end of a branch of the Qingxi Mountain Range, far from the sect. It lay between Qingxi Sect and Wind Gorge Valley.  

However, the spiritual energy in that branch was surprisingly rich—some areas even matched the quality of the sect's third-tier spirit fields. Both Qingxi Sect and Wind Gorge Valley had established spirit fields nearby, most of which were cultivated by affiliated cultivation families.  

Among them, about twenty acres of spirit fields had spiritual soil of even higher quality than the third-tier fields—almost reaching the standard of the sect's second-tier fields. These fields were directly managed by Qingxi Sect.  

Since the area also housed low-level demonic beasts, it attracted rogue cultivators and low-ranking disciples from nearby minor sects. Over time, a small marketplace had formed there.  

Though it couldn't compare to Qinghe Market near Qingxi Sect, it had a decent variety of goods.  

Qingxi Sect had set up some small shops there, mainly selling low-grade pills, talismans, and magical artifacts. Without a unified large storefront, each hall managed its own operations. Wind Gorge Valley did the same.  

Now, with the talisman-makers and cultivators from Yanji Market being reassigned, the two stewards thought of Chu Ning.  

After hearing all this, Chu Ning finally relaxed but still felt hesitant.  

Though it seemed he didn't have much choice, he couldn't help but ask, "Stewards, is there any danger in going to Yanji Market? I mean, like rogue cultivators or demonic beast attacks?"  

Seeing his cautious demeanor, neither steward laughed at him—it was a reasonable concern for someone as new and low-level as Chu Ning.  

He Changyou immediately reassured him, "Yanji Market is jointly managed by Qingxi Sect and Wind Gorge Valley. Many nearby families are affiliated with us. The sect's Law Enforcement Hall has a small team stationed there, and the External Affairs Hall also assigns stewards who visit the marketplace every few days. So you don't need to worry—no rogue cultivator would dare cause trouble there."  

"As for demonic beasts, apart from occasional beast tides, there aren't any high-level ones nearby. Even during a beast tide, they're only first or second-tier, which pose no threat to a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator like you."  

Chu Ning sighed in relief but then asked, "When do I need to go, and how long will I stay there?"  

"In five days, you'll go with a few disciples from other halls. As for the duration..." He Changyou paused briefly before answering uncertainly, "It depends on the sect's overall personnel arrangements."  

*Got it—depends on how many survive that secret mission.* Chu Ning thought to himself.  

Their visit today wasn't to seek his opinion but to inform him of the assignment. As an outer sect disciple, he had little say.  

Still, he had to try bargaining.  

With a troubled expression, he said, "Stewards, given my low cultivation level, shouldn't I be provided with some protective items for this mission?"  

He Changyou and Liao Yunming fell silent at his request.  

Seeing their lack of response, Chu Ning sighed inwardly—*these old foxes.*  

Then, he turned to Liao Yunming.  

"Steward Liao, I recall you once said that if I achieved a 60% success rate in crafting five types of basic talismans, I could learn the Spiritual Talisman Method."  

Liao Yunming blinked, then nodded. "I did say that."  

Suddenly, as if realizing something, he looked at Chu Ning uncertainly. "Don't tell me you've already reached that level?"  

Chu Ning nodded. "I'd like to demonstrate in front of both of you."  

Liao Yunming gave him a long, searching look.  

Calmly, Chu Ning took out his talisman brush, ink, and paper from his storage pouch.  

Originally, he had planned to wait before approaching Liao Yunming about the Spiritual Talisman Method. But plans changed—who knew how long this assignment would last? Now was the time to secure as many benefits as possible.  

Quickly reviewing the basic talisman techniques in his mind, Chu Ning began crafting.  

Starting with Flame Talismans and Frost Talismans, he moved on to others.  

Over the next hour, the expressions of Liao Yunming and He Changyou shifted repeatedly as they watched.  

Chu Ning crafted fifty talismans in succession—ten of each type—with a consistent 60% success rate for each.  

When he placed the thirty completed talismans before Liao Yunming, the steward's eyes gleamed brightly.
