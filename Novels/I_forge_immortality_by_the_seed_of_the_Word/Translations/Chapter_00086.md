# Chapter 85 - Thousand Techniques Pavilion

Inside a quiet chamber of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, five figures in purple robes sat cross-legged in silence. Their eyes were lightly closed, appearing to be either meditating or waiting for something. Among them were three men and two women, including the previously mentioned Yang Bai and Ou Wu.

"He's here!" Yang Bai suddenly opened his eyes and looked toward the entrance, seemingly sensing someone's arrival. The other four also opened their eyes, curiosity evident on their faces.

After several dozen breaths, Qiu Xiu Jun's figure slowly appeared. Facing the numerous gazes, he showed no surprise, as if he had anticipated this. He calmly took his seat.

"Junior Brother Qiu, how did it go?" Yang Bai asked in a composed voice.

"Reporting to Senior Brother, as we previously surmised, Junior Brother Zhang Jing has indeed condensed source talismans—and not just one. He's even managed to condense the source talisman for the mid-grade Li Xing Talisman," Qiu Xiu Jun reported in one breath, detailing everything he had witnessed.

Silence filled the room.

After a long pause, a woman with delicate features remarked, "Isn't this another Senior Brother You? Wait, no—Senior Brother You only succeeded in condensing source talismans after reaching the tenth level of Qi Refinement, didn't he?" Her eyes couldn't hide a trace of astonishment.

"Indeed, this junior's talent in the path of formation talismans might even surpass Senior Brother You's slightly," another woman with plain features but an extremely striking figure chimed in.

"So, Junior Brother Qiu, Junior Brother Zhang Jing must have agreed to join the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, right?" Yang Bai asked with a smile.

To everyone's surprise, Qiu Xiu Jun shook his head and sighed. "Senior Brother, Junior Brother Zhang Jing didn't agree immediately. He said he would consider it."

Yang Bai's heart sank. Frowning, he asked, "Did you not tell Junior Brother Zhang Jing that our Thousand Techniques Pavilion is the most suitable place for him? Given that this concerns a top-tier Dao Foundation, he shouldn't have any reason to refuse."

Qiu Xiu Jun gave a bitter smile. "I told him everything I could. But that youngster... his talent isn't limited to formation talismans. His aptitude in the path of true techniques is equally formidable. To be frank, Junior Brother Zhang Jing is currently cultivating an upper-grade inheritance, and it's undoubtedly a perfect compatibility. He's already at the seventh level of Qi Refinement. At this rate, he'll likely enter the Myriad Spirits Minor Heaven. There's even a chance he might directly comprehend Dao Intent there. Moreover, most of the inner disciples who emerged from the Luo Du team are concentrated in the Inheritance Pavilion..."

"So, what you're saying is that the path of formation talismans doesn't hold as much appeal for him as we initially thought," Yang Bai mused, a flicker of contemplation in his eyes. It was indeed a valid concern.

"Exactly, Senior Brother. I've returned to discuss with everyone what conditions we can offer to attract him to the Thousand Techniques Pavilion."

"This matter is simple. I think high-grade cultivation resources would suffice," Ou Wu, who had remained silent until now, suddenly spoke up. "Find out which attribute his inheritance corresponds to and allocate the appropriate high-grade resources—Primordial Water Essence, Verdant Wood Spirit Liquid, or Earth Vein Gold Marrow. When it comes to recruiting talent, our Thousand Techniques Pavilion is the expert."

At that moment, two figures abruptly appeared side by side in the room. 

On the left stood an old man with a goatee, his expression kindly but his aura terrifyingly vast. Merely standing there caused the surrounding light and shadows to distort spontaneously. 

On the right was a middle-aged man with dark skin, dressed plainly and appearing utterly ordinary. Yet, the glint in his eyes faintly revealed the birth and dissolution of countless formation patterns—no less imposing than the old man with the goatee.

"Greetings, Pavilion Master! Greetings, Senior Brother You!" Instantly, everyone rose and bowed respectfully.

The goateed old man nodded with a smile but said nothing further.

"Everyone, please be seated," the middle-aged man addressed as 'Senior Brother You' said warmly, his voice carrying a touch of rustic simplicity.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"

Senior Brother You swept his gaze across the room. "The Junior Brother Zhang Jing you were just discussing—I've reviewed his records. He's indeed a promising seedling. The Pavilion Master and I have discussed it. After I ascend to the upper realm, barring unforeseen circumstances, Junior Brother Zhang Jing may very well become the next Chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion. You must all devote your utmost efforts to this matter."

"Junior Brother Qiu," he turned to Qiu Xiu Jun.

"At your command, Senior Brother," Qiu Xiu Jun responded nervously under Senior Brother You's gaze.

"Make another trip to see him. This time, bring enough Primordial Water Essence to support his cultivation up to the tenth level of Qi Refinement," Senior Brother You instructed.

"Senior Brother," Yang Bai couldn't suppress his doubts any longer. "What if the Inheritance Pavilion—"

"No need to worry!" Senior Brother You smiled confidently. "Within the Myriad Spirits Minor Heaven, I will personally demonstrate the might of the formation talisman path to Junior Brother Zhang Jing. By the time he emerges, he'll know which choice to make. Moreover, in these coming years, I will personally guide him in laying the foundation for a top-tier formation talisman Dao."

With that, he turned to the goateed Pavilion Master. "Pavilion Master, what do you think?"

"Haha, Yuan Ming, your considerations are thorough. With this, our Thousand Techniques Pavilion may have two consecutive Chiefs ranked on the True Spirit Leaderboard. This old man is deeply grateful," the Pavilion Master laughed heartily.

"You flatter me, Pavilion Master. Before departing for the upper realm, nurturing a worthy Chief for the Thousand Techniques Pavilion is my duty," Senior Brother You replied with equal warmth.

As they spoke, their figures gradually faded away, leaving Qiu Xiu Jun and the other five exchanging bewildered glances.

"Well, well. So before he's even joined the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, he's already been designated as the next Chief!" Ou Wu exclaimed in amazement.

"Ah, Senior Brother Ou, if you had such talent, perhaps Senior Brother You would hand the position over to you right now," the voluptuous woman teased.

Meanwhile, in the Luo Du Building...

Senior Brother Li sat at the head of the table, his fingers lightly tapping the surface as if deep in thought. The deputy captains seated on either side were enveloped in a heavy silence.

"Senior Brother Li, the Dao Academy's rewards will be distributed next month. Has the inner court really given no indication at all?" someone finally broke the silence, unable to hide their resentment.

"That's right. I heard this batch includes high-grade cultivation resources like Primordial Water Essence and Verdant Wood Spirit Liquid. How can we just hand over half of such precious items?"

"Let it go," Senior Brother Li said impassively.

His words sent a ripple of shock through the room. The gazes directed at him were a mix of confusion, anger, and disappointment.

Remembering Senior Brother Xie Yu's instructions, Senior Brother Li offered no further explanation.

Suddenly, as if sensing something, his face lit up with delight.

*Seventh level of Qi Refinement? So fast!*

Rising abruptly, he said calmly, "That's all for today. I have matters to attend to."

Without waiting for a response, he strode out briskly, leaving the others perplexed. What could possibly be more important than their current discussion?

Among them, only Senior Brother Li seemed to have guessed the reason, a knowing smile playing on his lips. He understood Senior Brother Li's temperament better than anyone. 

If Senior Brother Li chose to concede willingly, there was only one possible explanation—the real show was yet to come!
