# Chapter 27 The Old Residence

The Concealment Art was considered a technique yet not quite a true spell—it was more of a method for controlling spiritual energy. It involved arranging a special talisman pattern within the body to form a net that concealed one's spiritual fluctuations.

Unlike other techniques, the Concealment Art didn't require the coordination of intent; it could be activated simply by completing the talisman pattern. Li Shiming wasn't worried about the complexity of the pattern. He scanned the *Concealment Art* into the large server IBM z15 and repeatedly studied it with his consciousness. Within minutes, he had memorized the entire talisman pattern.

Channeling his spiritual energy, he began drawing the pattern beneath his skin. Surprisingly, he encountered no difficulties—the intricate design was flawlessly executed. A slight tremor passed through the spiritual energy vortex within him, and suddenly, it felt as though it had been veiled by something.

Though he had successfully activated the Concealment Art, Li Shiming frowned. The sensation of being restrained by the technique was uncomfortable. Moreover, casting spells or channeling a significant amount of spiritual energy would disrupt its effect. Against cultivators far stronger than himself, the Concealment Art's efficacy was also limited.

Still, since he had obtained it for free, any usefulness was a bonus. He didn't expect much more.

"Hmm? Fellow Daoist, you've already mastered the Concealment Art?" Fan Yiyang, rubbing his belly as he stepped out of the cabin, was startled to see Li Shiming. His surprise was understandable—how could someone master and apply the technique in such a short time?

While cultivators, nourished by spiritual energy, surpassed mortals in many ways—especially in memory—talisman patterns for spells were notoriously complex. No matter how basic the Concealment Art was, it was still a technique.

*How many days did it take me to learn the Concealment Art?* Fan Yiyang wondered inwardly. He couldn't quite recall such a trivial matter from long ago, but he was certain it hadn't taken less than a month.

Looking at Li Shiming standing by the railing, Fan Yiyang felt a mix of emotions. Even the spiritual rice he had just eaten didn't seem as satisfying anymore.

"Many thanks to you, Fellow Daoist!" Li Shiming bowed in gratitude.

Fan Yiyang's enthusiasm grew. Befriending a future talent within the sect was best done before they rose to prominence. Though he had some connections in the sect, his own mediocre aptitude limited the support he received from his backers. To thrive in the sect, making friends was his guiding principle.

He harbored no grand ambitions—given his talent, this life was all he had. His goal was to accumulate enough resources to establish his own family in the mortal world, something that required strong allies.

Twelve days passed aboard the official ship. During this time, Li Shiming and Fan Yiyang became friends.

"Fellow Daoist Li, we've arrived at Zhongdu. Let us part ways here. I hope to see you again in the sect!" Fan Yiyang clasped his hands in farewell even before the ship docked.

"Fellow Daoist Fan, until we meet again!" Li Shiming returned the gesture.

With a leap toward the riverbank, Fan Yiyang's figure blurred as a talisman's light flashed, and he vanished from sight. Though Li Shiming was also at the second level of Qi Refinement, he lacked such skills. Moreover, traveling with maids, servants, and numerous belongings made such a graceful exit impossible.

Whether intentional or not, Fan Yiyang's display left Li Shiming envious.

As the official ship docked, Li Shiming disembarked with his entourage.

"Young Master, the mansion's carriage has come to fetch you!" the servant Mo Yan exclaimed excitedly.

Following his pointing finger, Li Shiming saw an old, worn-out carriage. If not for the insignia of the fourth-rank Li Family, he wouldn't have believed this was the carriage from Zhongdu. But in the capital, a fourth-rank official wasn't particularly remarkable.

He sighed inwardly but had no complaints about the carriage itself.

"Greetings, Young Master. I am Steward Zhang from the old residence in Zhongdu," the coachman bowed.

Upon entering the carriage, however, Li Shiming realized he had misjudged. The interior was just as well-furnished as the carriage he had used in Nanling Prefecture—the shabby exterior was merely a disguise.

With his luggage loaded onto the carriage, Li Shiming sat inside with Si Qin, his maidservant, while Mo Yan and four guards followed on foot.

Si Qin opened the carriage window, gazing curiously at the bustling capital of Great Xia.

"Steward Zhang, how much longer until we reach the old residence?" Li Shiming asked, uninterested in the city's splendor. His priority was returning to the old residence as soon as possible.

Over the past twelve days, he had used the IBM z15's computational power to repeatedly simulate the activation method for the Spirit Gathering Plate. Combined with insights from his conversations with Fan Yiyang, he was confident he could activate it. He had deliberately refrained from using the *Five Elements Absorption Technique* to cultivate during this time, only replenishing his spiritual energy in the server room after casting the *Spring Rain Technique*.

"Young Master, we'll arrive once we pass the street ahead," Steward Zhang replied, flicking the reins to hasten the carriage.

As the carriage sped up, the four guards and Mo Yan broke into a jog.

"Is this the old residence?" Li Shiming murmured as he stood before the vermilion gates.

---

The vermilion gates, though not small, were modest by Great Xia's standards—hardly befitting a fourth-rank official's residence. Of course, Li Wenyan spent most of his time at the Nanling Prefecture government office, but even so, the entrance seemed rather humble.

The gates swung open, and Steward Zhang bowed, inviting him inside. Three elderly servants—two men and one woman—stood in formation just beyond the entrance. Including Steward Zhang, the old residence was managed by just four people.

The residence had three courtyards. Passing through the main gate and the inner gate brought them to the central courtyard, flanked by east and west wing rooms, with the main hall directly ahead and a small garden in the center.

"The master's letter instructed that you are to stay in the main hall," Steward Zhang reminded him softly.

"Mo Yan, take the luggage to the main hall," Li Shiming said without hesitation. As the master's son and with his father absent, occupying the main hall was only natural.

More importantly, the main hall had side rooms on both sides and rear chambers, forming a secure perimeter ideal for the four guards' protection. Of course, Li Shiming preferred the main hall for its spaciousness, which was perfect for cultivation.

"Steward Zhang, no one is to enter the main hall without my permission. If there's anything, inform Si Qin," Li Shiming instructed firmly before stepping inside.

The interior was clean and simply furnished, with no extravagant decorations but all necessities accounted for.

Mo Yan and the servants carried the luggage into the main hall, where Si Qin dismissed them and began unpacking. These tasks were her domain—the only female servant in the residence was the cook.
