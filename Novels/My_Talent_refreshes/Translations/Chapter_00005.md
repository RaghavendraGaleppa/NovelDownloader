# Chapter 5: Cultivation Technique

Chu Ning stepped out of his room and saw a portly middle-aged man standing outside the courtyard. He quickly quickened his pace and approached, clasping his fists in greeting.

"Greetings, Senior Brother."

The man smiled and said, "My surname is Zhuang, Zhuang Yunde. I'm the duty disciple responsible for the Ding District."

Duty disciple? This was the first time Chu Ning had heard this term, but he could roughly guess that it referred to a disciple assigned by the Hundred Arts Hall to manage affairs in this area.

So he clasped his fists again and said, "Chu Ning pays his respects to Senior Brother Zhuang."

As the saying goes, one can never be too polite. Seeing Chu Ning's courtesy, Zhuang Yunde's smile deepened. He took out a package from his storage bag and handed it to Chu Ning, then produced another booklet and passed it over solemnly.

"This is the basic wood-element cultivation technique of our Qingxi Sect. Although it's only a low-grade Yellow-rank technique, it has been refined and perfected by generations of predecessors. Junior Brother must take good care of it."

Chu Ning listened and quickly accepted it, seeing five characters written on the booklet: "Evergreen Wood Technique."

This was a cultivation technique!

Chu Ning felt a surge of anticipation and excitement, which he didn't suppress this time, allowing it to show on his face.

Zhuang Yunde wasn't surprised by this reaction; in fact, he found it perfectly normal. Most newcomers to the world of cultivation reacted this way upon receiving their first technique. If Chu Ning had been completely indifferent, it would have struck him as odd.

After appropriately displaying a hint of excitement, Chu Ning immediately asked, "Senior Brother Zhuang, you mentioned this is a low-grade Yellow-rank technique. What are the different levels of cultivation techniques?"

Perhaps Chu Ning's respectful demeanor had earned him some goodwill from Zhuang Yunde, who patiently explained, "Cultivation techniques are divided into four ranks: Heaven, Earth, Mystic, and Yellow. Each rank is further divided into high, middle, and low grades."

Chu Ning nodded slightly in understanding. So, a low-grade Yellow-rank technique was the most basic of the basics.

However, Chu Ning wasn't overly concerned. As a farming laborer disciple, having any cultivation technique to practice was already a boon. Moreover, this wood-element technique was exactly what he needed.

"Alright, I need to deliver items to others now," Zhuang Yunde said, turning to leave. But halfway through his turn, he paused slightly and glanced at the courtyard.

"I recall this courtyard belongs to Cao Dongxin? Are you with him?"

When Chu Ning confirmed, Zhuang Yunde shook his head and said, "That fellow has a rather peculiar temperament and isn't easy to get along with. Your luck isn't great."

With that, Zhuang Yunde turned and left.

Chu Ning watched him go and sighed inwardly. It seemed his earlier impression was correct—Cao Dongxin's reclusive nature was well-known.

Setting the matter aside for now, Chu Ning looked at the booklet in his hand and quickly returned to his room, eager to study the Evergreen Wood Technique.

*Creak!*

Just then, the sound of a door opening echoed as Cao Dongxin emerged and called out, "Go to the kitchen and prepare some food."

Chu Ning was momentarily taken aback. It was still early—even if dinner were to be served sooner, there was still half a shichen (an hour) left. Why the rush?

Moreover, Cao Dongxin had chosen this exact moment, just as Chu Ning was about to study the technique, to make his appearance. It was hard to believe it wasn't deliberate.

Thinking this, Chu Ning responded swiftly, "Yes, Senior Brother. I'll put my things away and go immediately."

He hurried into his room, placed the package inside, and tucked the Evergreen Wood Technique booklet into his robe before heading to the kitchen.

Opening the rice jar, Chu Ning peered inside curiously. "I heard cultivators eat spirit rice, but this is just ordinary rice."

He chuckled wryly to himself. Spirit rice probably wasn't something laborer disciples could casually consume. And even if Cao Dongxin had any, he likely wouldn't share it with Chu Ning.

Slightly disappointed, Chu Ning started a fire and began cooking. Fortunately, his body retained memories from its previous owner, so these tasks weren't difficult.

After putting rice and water into the pot and chopping some vegetables, Chu Ning took out the booklet to read while waiting for the food to cook.

The technique was written in a very basic and detailed manner for beginners, covering not only the cultivation method but also foundational knowledge about meridians and spells. Chu Ning found it fascinating and gained a deeper understanding of the technique.

The Evergreen Wood Technique, a low-grade Yellow-rank wood-element cultivation method, was divided into three layers corresponding to the early (Qi Refinement levels 1-3), middle (4-6), and late (7-9) stages of Qi Refinement. The tenth level of Qi Refinement, known as the Great Perfection stage, and the subsequent Foundation Establishment stage were not covered.

Moreover, what Chu Ning had received was only the first layer of the technique.

The booklet also included a spell called Evergreen Wood Flourishing Technique, which was highly beneficial for the growth of spiritual plants—enhancing their development, refining their essence, and improving their quality.

This spell was essential for Qingxi Sect's plant cultivation disciples, and their proficiency in it often reflected their overall strength.

"This includes a spell? Then what are the senior disciples supposed to teach?" Chu Ning wondered briefly before dismissing the thought.

Suddenly, he remembered something and focused inward. Sure enough, the prompts in his mind had changed:

[Nine Yin Body Forging Technique (100/100)]  
[Talent: Yin Wood Spirit Body]  
[Evergreen Wood Technique (Low-grade Yellow-rank), First Layer (0/300)]

"The progress for the Evergreen Wood Technique has appeared. Hmm, why isn't the spell listed?"

Though puzzled, Chu Ning didn't dwell on it. He would figure it out as he practiced, just as he had with the Nine Yin Body Forging Technique.

However, now wasn't the time for cultivation. Seeing that the food was almost ready, Chu Ning tucked the booklet away and finished preparing the meal. After steaming the rice and stir-frying the vegetables, he called Cao Dongxin to eat.

Chu Ning ate quickly but had to wait patiently as Cao Dongxin took his time. After cleaning up, just as he was about to return to his room, Cao Dongxin stopped him again.

"Tidy up and sweep the courtyard."

Though inwardly cursing, Chu Ning showed no sign of displeasure and did as instructed. He then performed various other chores under Cao Dongxin's orders.

Only when Cao Dongxin finally retired to his room did Chu Ning wash up and return to his own quarters.

Reflecting on the day's events, Chu Ning could somewhat understand Cao Dongxin's mindset. The man had likely spent too long at the bottom of the hierarchy, becoming reclusive and even somewhat twisted. Even without any personal grudge, he enjoyed tormenting others to satisfy his own vanity—or perhaps he simply couldn't stand seeing others do well.

As Zhuang Yunde had said, Chu Ning's luck wasn't great. The disciples in neighboring courtyards had all returned to their rooms early to cultivate.

He resolved to endure the next three months, pretending to be naive and ignorant to avoid provoking further harassment.

Putting the matter aside, Chu Ning sat cross-legged on his bed, ready to begin cultivating the Evergreen Wood Technique. According to the description of his talent, "Yin Wood Spirit Body," it greatly enhanced his aptitude for wood-element techniques and spells. Surely, this would give him an advantage in mastering the Evergreen Wood Technique!
