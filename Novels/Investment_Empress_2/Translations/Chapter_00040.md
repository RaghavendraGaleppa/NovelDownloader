# Chapter 40: The Gilded Heavenly Scripture Seal, Upgradable Divine Arts, and the World Seed!

"Three investment feedback rewards at once?"

Li Mo was pleasantly surprised and thrilled.

The rewards reaped from the Ice Cube this time seemed to be high in quality and satisfying in quantity.

For a moment, Li Mo was almost overwhelmed.

Truly, the Ice Cube's "thighs" were the best to cling to.

Tomorrow, he must treat the Ice Cube to a good meal as a reward.

"Let's take a look at them one by one."

Li Mo turned his gaze to the first reward that appeared.

**[Gilded Heavenly Scripture Seal]:** "Can elevate the grade of any martial art below the level of a Divine Art, including Divine Arts themselves."

"It can even elevate the grade of a Divine Art?"

Li Mo sucked in a cold breath, completely lacking in worldly experience.

To be honest, he had only heard of Divine Arts.

要知道, the Clear Abyss Sect has such a long history, and its founding ancestor came from the Central Continent, yet the highest martial art within the sect is merely a Supreme Art.

Mastering a mid-grade martial art to perfection makes one a powerhouse in Ziyang Prefecture.

Mastering a high-grade martial art to perfection allows one to establish a sect.

Yes.

As for the current Li Mo, as long as his realm keeps up, relying solely on his Fire Crane Thousand Feathers Sword Art would make him a named expert in a prefecture.

Regarding Divine Arts...

Li Mo had only heard storytellers say that a hundred years ago, a powerful figure named the Thousand-Form Martial尊 in the Central Continent fled to the Eastern Wasteland with a Divine Art.

At that time, countless experts from outside the region descended. Local sects like the Clear Abyss Sect didn't even have the qualifications to intervene.

Even the Great Yu Imperial Court's Imperial Seekers personally took action.

In the end, no one knows who obtained that Divine Art.

In his understanding, Divine Arts were the ceiling of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Above Divine Arts?

This was completely beyond Li Mo's imagination.

"It's a pity I don't even have a Divine Art right now. I'll save it for now."

Li Mo's heart was racing, as if a poor man had suddenly stumbled upon a chest of gold bars.

The gold bars were good, but he couldn't spend them for the time being.

The best martial art he currently possesses is only a Supreme Art.

Using the Gilded Heavenly Scripture Seal on a Supreme Art would be a complete waste.

"Among the Heavenly Scripture Seals, there should be one that can upgrade Supreme Arts."

"At that time, I could first upgrade a Supreme Art to a Divine Art..."

"And 'a mere Divine Art,' the Ice Cube might just drop one for me at any time."

Li Mo's mindset had always been good.

Having read so many novels in his previous life, even if he hadn't eaten pork, he had seen a pig run.

Stay calm, stay calm.

Li Mo looked at the next reward.

**[World Seed]:** "A small world in its nascent state, currently in a state of chaotic undevelopment. It will gradually grow and perfect along with the host's strength, with the potential to evolve into a true Great World in the future!"

A Great World!

Just these five words were enough to illustrate its value.

Li Mo was genuinely a little stunned this time.

Wait, I've just started practicing martial arts.

Is the standard for the future already leaning towards the direction of Pangu creating the heavens and the earth?

The World Seed would grow stronger as he grew stronger.

And as the small world grows stronger, it would, in turn, nourish him.

In the end, the world and I are one.

In his world, the concept of strength and weakness was no longer important.

He was the Heavenly Dao, he was the Sovereign. With a single thought from him, the world could be turned upside down, and the stars could shift.

"The vast Nine Heavens and Ten Lands also started from a World Seed."

"Did it expand naturally, or did it grow by relying on a person?"

Li Mo's mind wandered, and he couldn't help but speculate.

Well, this was not something he could explore for now.

In his perception, his small world couldn't even be considered a seedling yet.

"Claim."

The moment the thought crossed Li Mo's mind.

The next instant, the surrounding environment transformed like ripples in water.

In a daze, he saw countless colors surging, reorganizing, and changing, a kaleidoscope of sights.

In the blink of an eye, all the colors vanished into thin air, leaving only an endless void.

When he came to his senses, he found himself standing in a pure white space.

All around him were boundless white mists.

The space he had already开辟 under his feet was only about the size of a basketball court, a few rounds smaller than the Autumn Water Pavilion.

But, this space was entirely his.

"Sword, come!"

Li Mo's expression was solemn as he casually beckoned.

Immediately, an unknown sword flew over, its aura sharp and its edge gleaming.

He was dressed in white like snow, resembling a true peerless swordsman.

Suddenly, he let out a great shout:

"Sword, open the Heavenly Gate!"

Instantly, infinite sword qi surged out, sweeping through heaven and earth.

Ahem...

If one ignored the fact that this 'heaven and earth' was only about a dozen meters in diameter, this sword strike was quite impressive.

"It's so cool to be a swordsman."

"If only I could use this move outside as well."

Li Mo sighed.

His sword talent hadn't changed; it was just his showy personality acting up, and this world was cooperating with his performance...

"It looks a bit too empty here."

"Let's decorate it a little."

Li Mo developed an interest in tidying up his private space.

---

...

Ten minutes later.

Li Mo, having exhausted all the scenes he had accumulated from reading novels, transformed the place.

The empty ground now had pavilions and terraces, all crystal clear, highlighting a low-key but classy vibe.

Among the pavilions, there were ancient wells, chessboards, cauldrons... a series of extraordinary items.

Li Mo even wanted to add some exotic flowers and rare herbs.

Unfortunately...

"It seems I still can't create life right now."

Li Mo realized.

Even as the sovereign of this world, there were things he couldn't do.

For example, creating life.

"I can bring living beings from the outside in."

"But that being cannot be stronger than me."

"Things created inside cannot be taken out for now."

Li Mo fiddled around for a bit and gained a better understanding of the small world.

...

Late night.

His consciousness exited the World Seed.

Li Mo glanced at the moon outside.

He estimated that he had spent about an hour inside, and roughly the same amount of time had passed outside.

Hmm, for now, the time flow between the two worlds seems to be similar.

"Oh right, there's one more feedback."

He had just been having so much fun.

Li Mo almost forgot about the last piece of feedback.

**[Phantasmagorical琉璃 Mask]:** "A thousand changes and transformations, can block all forms of detection."

The description was concise.

Li Mo directly took it out.

It was a metallic mask of a琉璃 color.

After putting it on, he looked at himself in the mirror and found that his entire aura had changed.

If he were to change his clothes.

Even he wouldn't recognize the person behind the mask as himself.

For instance, people have auras.

But as long as he is willing, after putting on the mask, he can give people a profound and unfathomable feeling.

Not only can the aura be switched, but the shape of the mask can also be changed.

Swish—

The next moment.

The Phantasmagorical琉璃 Mask transformed into a dragon-head mask.

Swish—

The dragon head turned into a cute pig-head mask.

"The voice can change too..."

As Li Mo spoke, his voice became deep and resonant.

He nodded in satisfaction.

He retracted his mind and began to practice.

...

Afternoon.

Just as he was about to have a meal and practice the eleventh meridian, a guest arrived at the Autumn Water Pavilion.

Elder寒鶴, an old acquaintance.

"Li Mo and Ying Bing, why didn't they go to the Divine Weapon Peak today?"

The old man came in and immediately asked Shang Wu with a frown.

"Why would they go to the Divine Weapon Peak?"

Shang Wu was comfortably lying on a rocking chair, soaking up the sun, and casually picked her ear.

"They are the top three of the sect's trial!"

Elder寒鶴 said impatiently.

Why is it said that every inner disciple can go to the Divine Weapon Cave to choose a weapon?

Because entering the inner sect means one can generally achieve a good result in the sect's trial.

And thus, one would get a chance to enter the Divine Weapon Cave to choose a weapon.

Of course, as the top three, the rewards are more than that, but the sect is currently busy, and some rewards have not been distributed yet.

"It seems there is such a matter."

Shang Wu tilted her head and remembered.

Elder寒鶴 didn't want to say more to her. Seeing that both Ying Bing and Li Mo were there, he said:

"Let's go, come with me to the Divine Weapon Peak."

"Elder寒鶴, I have a request."

Ying Bing suddenly spoke.

"Mm, go ahead."

Elder寒鶴, who was about to turn around, stopped.

Informing the disciples was originally a task that didn't require the Peak Lord like him.

The reason he came in person was precisely because Ying Bing was the sect's precious treasure.

Naturally, he had to consider her opinion.

Ying Bing said: "Regarding the day to enter the Divine Weapon Cave, I would like to postpone it for a few days."

"Why?"

Ying Bing glanced at Li Mo and said softly: "I feel that my sword art can still improve, and then I will be able to get a better weapon."

"So... it's not impossible."

Elder寒鶴 raised his eyebrows, seemingly surprised by the progress of her sword art, and then nodded:

"Of course, this is possible, but it can be delayed for at most three days."

"Three days later, the Divine Weapon Peak will enter the season where the earthly fire is at its most intense for the year, and the Divine Weapon Cave will be inaccessible."

"I understand."

Three days.

Ying Bing was confident that she could raise Li Mo's sword art proficiency to another level.

She figured that at that time, gaining the recognition of a famous weapon would not be difficult.
