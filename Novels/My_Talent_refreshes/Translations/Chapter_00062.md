# Chapter 62: Such a Stroke of Luck  

"Liao Yunming, what are you trying to do? Don't you trust my word, He Changyou?"  

He Changyou's expression darkened as he addressed Liao Yunming directly by name, dropping the usual honorific "senior brother."  

Although the Qingxi Sect had always excelled in spiritual plant cultivation, it was considered an auxiliary skill—one that could mostly be handled by outer disciples. As a result, the status of the Spiritual Plant Division within the Hundred Arts Hall wasn't particularly high.  

He Changyou had brought Chu Ning here today specifically to show off this promising talent to Liao Yunming. Thus, Liao's skepticism naturally provoked his ire.  

"Junior Brother He, don't misunderstand," Liao Yunming said with a placating wave. "I'm not doubting you. I merely wish to assess this disciple's talisman-making aptitude. If he truly has talent, our Talisman Pavilion would be happy to impart more advanced techniques."  

At this, He Changyou's expression softened slightly. However, a trace of hesitation remained.  

Back in the Spiritual Plant Division's training grounds, he had publicly dismissed the idea that Chu Ning's success rate was mere luck. But privately, he couldn't help but wonder if the young man's initial success had been a fluke—a result of relaxed confidence after two early successes.  

Liao Yunming seemed to read his thoughts. "Don't worry about the success rate—that can be affected by many factors. I only need to observe his technique to make a fair judgment."  

With this, He Changyou could hardly refuse. He turned to Chu Ning.  

"Since Senior Brother Liao wishes to evaluate you, do your best."  

"Yes!"  

Chu Ning bowed in acknowledgment, though inwardly, his mind raced.  

Liao Yunming's words had been clear: if he could demonstrate his 50% success rate again, he would gain access to higher-level talisman techniques.  

This was an irresistible opportunity.  

Having crafted the Wood Escape Talisman, Chu Ning was already well aware of the extraordinary advantages his Spiritual Source Constitution provided in talisman-making. If he could leverage this chance to learn more advanced techniques, it would be a tremendous boon.  

Were it not for the risk of drawing too much attention—and potentially exposing his secrets—he might have even considered showcasing an even higher success rate.  

Still, he resolved to perform well enough to impress Liao Yunming.  

At the very least, a new disciple displaying talent in talisman-making wasn't so unbelievable as to raise suspicions.  

After steadying his breath, Chu Ning retrieved his brush, ink, and paper from his storage pouch and began crafting another Wood Escape Talisman.  

The first attempt had minor flaws, but it was enough to make Liao Yunming's eyes gleam with interest.  

By the time Chu Ning smoothly completed several more, the Talisman Pavilion elder's expression had grown fervent.  

"Junior Brother—no, Senior Brother He," Liao Yunming suddenly said, "how about we discuss something?"  

He Changyou blinked in surprise.  

Liao Yunming then dropped a bombshell:  

"Transfer this disciple to our Talisman Pavilion. In return, we'll compensate your Hundred Arts Hall with a generous supply of talismans."  

He Changyou immediately grasped the implication.  

Chu Ning's earlier performance hadn't been luck—his talent was genuine, and impressive enough that even a Talisman Pavilion elder wanted to recruit him.  

"You're quite the schemer," He Changyou laughed. "Chu Ning also has exceptional aptitude for wood-element spells. He's a key disciple of our Spiritual Plant Division—no, the entire Hundred Arts Hall. Don't waste your breath."  

Chu Ning, listening nearby, couldn't help but find the situation absurd.  

Since when had he become a "key disciple" of the Spiritual Plant Division?  

Just days ago, he had been laboring in the lowest-ranked District D, unknown to anyone except Zhuang Yunde.  

The thought unsettled him.  

He had been too conspicuous lately, straying from his usual low-profile approach.  

All he wanted now was for this matter to conclude so he could return to his quiet, steady cultivation.  

But clearly, that wouldn't happen anytime soon.  

"He Changyou, don't waste his potential!" Liao Yunming argued, growing impatient. "This disciple's talisman-making talent is extraordinary—rare even in our Talisman Pavilion. Would you really relegate him to a life of menial farming?"  

"What's wrong with farming?" He Changyou retorted. "Without the support of divisions like ours, where would you get your resources? The paper, the brushes—all of it comes from materials we cultivate!"  

"Senior Brother Liao," He Changyou's tone turned firm, "you've verified Chu Ning's skill. Now honor the sect's agreement and teach him the techniques. Unless your Talisman Pavilion intends to defy the sect's rules?"  

At the mention of sect authority, Liao Yunming hesitated.  

Then, his expression brightened with sudden inspiration.  

"I have an idea. Instead of transferring him, we can petition the sect to grant him dual-division status as an outer disciple. Would that satisfy you?"  

"Dual-division disciple?"  

"Dual-division disciple?"  

He Changyou and Chu Ning echoed the term simultaneously—the former thoughtful, the latter astonished.  

Liao Yunming smiled at Chu Ning's reaction.  

"You may not know this, Disciple Chu, but there have been cases where outer disciples displayed talent in multiple disciplines. When disputes arose between divisions, the sect introduced the dual-division status. Such disciples can learn techniques from two divisions, though they must also complete tasks for both. The only requirement is that they qualify as outer disciples."  

Noticing Chu Ning's hesitation, he quickly added,  

"But don't worry—our Talisman Pavilion's tasks are minimal. You'd only need to practice talisman-making regularly and submit a set amount periodically. You could easily manage this alongside your farming duties."  

Chu Ning's heart leaped.  

Such a stroke of luck!  

"Senior Brother Liao, that's a fine solution," He Changyou conceded. "Chu Ning reached the fourth layer of Qi Refining in just over a year. With his talisman talent, he meets the outer disciple criteria."  

"But," he added cautiously, "if he becomes a dual-division disciple, will the Talisman Pavilion grant him the same treatment as its other disciples?"  

"Absolutely!" Liao Yunming declared. "Once the sect approves, he'll be a full member of our division. I'll personally teach him an advanced talisman technique."  

He Changyou nodded and turned to Chu Ning.  

"What do you say?"
