# Chapter 5: The Profound Numinous Immortal Body, The Entrance Ceremony

In the chamber of the Green Plums.

For the少年 and girl who had known each other for so many years, it was the first time they had been alone in a room together.

The curtains of the large bed were lowered by a fair hand, obscuring the girl's figure.

"She's turned into an ice lump again."

Li Mo withdrew his gaze, hugging a blanket as he lay on the soft couch.

It seemed she wasn't the type to be easily swayed by a few words.

Forget it, who knows what's going through her mind...

"Come to think of it, investment doesn't necessarily have to be in the form of items?"

Li Mo mused thoughtfully, looking at the reward he had just received.

**[Profound Numinous Immortal Body]:** "Transcending the Nine Heavens, existing beyond the Ten Lands. An immortal body tempered through the rolling mortal dust, ultimately returning to the primordial simplicity. Without the form of self, without the form of all beings, encompassing all phenomena, possessing all kinds of mysteries."

"Claim Reward?"

The reward was simple, only four words.

But the word "Immortal" was so out of place that Li Mo raised an eyebrow.

The tone is completely off; this is clearly a martial world.

Could it just be an adjective to make the System seem more high-end and impressive?

Anyway.

It sounds pretty good.

With a thought, he claimed the reward.

Instantly.

A thunderclap that only he could hear exploded by his ear.

In his mind, it was as if dark clouds had been torn apart by thunder, plunging him into chaos with a roar. He could no longer even feel himself.

*Hum—*

*Hum—*

Within the chaos, it was like a storm, the heavens and earth just born, filled with countless colors and sounds.

Li Mo couldn't see clearly, nor could he hear clearly.

In that instant, he felt as insignificant as a speck of dust, yet as majestic and unapproachable as a god.

It was as if he no longer existed, yet he was everywhere.

He didn't know how much time had passed.

Li Mo lost consciousness.

Not far away.

On the bed, the silk curtains were gradually being covered in frost, as if they would shatter at a touch.

The girl hugged her long legs, her lips pale, her eyelashes dusted with snow.

Even the breath she exuded carried an ancient, unthawing chill.

She seemed to have been placed in an extremely cold ice prison.

But she was already accustomed to it, showing no pain or fear, only calmness.

Ying Bing knew this torment would end once she mastered the power of the Great Yin.

Before that, she first had to open her meridians.

"Pure Yang Pill."

"Xue Jing is considered one of the top alchemists in the territory of the Ziyang Prefecture."

Ying Bing pinched the pill and swallowed it.

A slight warmth rose from her Dantian, slowly flowing into her meridians.

Before the entrance ceremony, completing the opening of her meridians wouldn't be a problem!

Suddenly, she remembered something.

Ying Bing lifted the frozen-hard curtains and looked toward the soft couch.

She saw the少年 sleeping peacefully there, even snoring softly.

He was sleeping quite soundly?

"He... is okay?"

...

The next morning.

Li Mo opened his eyes on the soft couch. His gaze was as deep as if it held the starry sky, calm and clear like a mountain spring.

From the surface, he still looked like himself.

But even just standing there, he gave off a feeling of being one with nature.

**[Name: Li Mo]**
**[Age: 16]**
**[Root Bone: Profound Numinous Immortal Body.]**
**[Realm: None.]**
**[Destiny: ???]**
**[Evaluation: Carrying an immortal body, fate is chaotic. The future is unknowable.]**
**[Recent Experience: Relationship with childhood friend has eased, finally better than strangers.]**

Li Mo had thought his destiny would turn purple or even gold.

Who knew it would directly become two huge question marks.

"There are definitely changes."

"But what's different, I can't quite put my finger on it for the moment."

He thought about it and stopped dwelling on it.

The investment feedback the System had given so far, at least from the ice lump, had never disappointed him.

"I haven't even started martial cultivation yet, I can only slowly experience it."

Li Mo picked up a kettle to make some tea, only to find the water inside had frozen into ice.

The root of all this was because of the ice lump on the bed.

An astonishing chill was emanating from her, but he didn't feel cold at all.

From the looks of it.

At the very least, he had become immune to heat and cold.

"I won't have to worry about being eliminated from the entrance ceremony now."

"I should at least be able to enter the inner sect, right?"

Li Mo's mood lifted.

With nothing else to do, and unable to cultivate, he decided to go into the city to try his luck, to see if he could find a suitable investment target.

...

Two days passed in a flash.

Since getting the Pure Yang Pill, Ying Bing had stayed in her room without going out.

She didn't eat or drink.

Li Mo wasn't worried.

With such a heaven-defying destiny, she wouldn't starve herself to death.

It was probably due to her physique, so it was best not to disturb her.

So, over the past two days, the chill in the chamber of the Green Plums had persisted. The furnishings inside were probably ruined, and Li Mo had to pay five hundred taels of silver to settle the matter.

During these two days, Li Mo had also encountered various investment targets.

Most were rather ordinary, with very few showing a blue destiny.

Their recent experiences were all sorts of strange.

For example, a student with poor grades in a private school who wanted to find a rich woman.

For example, someone with too much money who found life boring and wanted to experience poverty.

There was even a burly man who longed to wear women's clothes...

For these experiences, Li Mo wanted to invest but was helpless to do so.

Of course, most people were normal.

Even a mosquito's leg is meat.

As a result, he received a lot of feedback. Very little of it was beneficial for martial arts practice; most of it was strange and unusual stuff.

---

Calligraphy and paintings, toys, ingredients, fine wine, and even the undergarments of a young maiden...

This method of casting a wide net yielded truly unremarkable returns.

On the morning of the third day.

"Quality is more important than quantity."

"From now on, unless under special circumstances, I won't proactively invest in white or gray destinies."

Li Mo pushed the door open and entered the room.

The first thing he saw was a graceful figure, combing her silky black hair in front of a mirror.

"You're better?"

"A bit better than before."

Ying Bing's porcelain-like face seemed to have gained a touch of color.

She had opened her meridians.

Successfully opening her meridians meant she was no longer in a state of blocked meridians, and it also meant her hidden talent was seeing the light of day again.

This was inseparable from that bottle of Pure Yang Pill.

"Come and have breakfast," Li Mo said with a smile.

Ying Bing picked up her bowl and said softly, "Thank you."

"What?"

Li Mo's movements paused, and his eyes widened.

The ice lump actually said thank you?

He was shocked.

"I didn't catch that, what did you just say?"

Li Mo wasn't sure.

But Ying Bing didn't speak anymore and started drinking her porridge.

When the sky was bright, the two of them finished breakfast and went downstairs together.

Today was the day the Qingyuan Sect opened its mountain.

The carriage couldn't move when it was still dozens of miles away because there were too many people, all crowding the official road.

They could only get down and walk on foot. The scene made Li Mo's DNA tingle a bit.

All around were young people, giving him the same feeling as when he used to go to the操场 for morning exercises in his student days.

After walking for about half an incense stick's time.

Up ahead, the gates of the Qingyuan Sect could be seen, along with many disciples of the sect wearing uniforms of various colors. In front of the disciples, seven stewards sat behind large tables.

*Dong—*
*Dong—*
*Dong—*

Three morning chimes rang out.

"Root bone is the first hurdle in martial arts training. If the root bone is too poor, it will be difficult to make progress on the path of martial arts. Even if you put in a thousand times the effort, it will be like a drop in the bucket."

"Those with inferior root bones should not waste their time. You may leave on your own."

A short, stout old man with ruddy cheeks spoke, his voice like thunder, rolling over the crowd.

No one left.

Everyone who had come here was either already confident or unwilling to give up until the very end. They were already at the mountain gate.

Since they were already here.

The short, stout old man saw this and waved his hand.

"Then line up, and come up one by one for the bone check."

As soon as he finished speaking, countless少年s and girls, under the management of the Qingyuan sect disciples,自觉ly lined up for the test.

The stewards seemed to have practiced a special technique. A simple pat on the shoulder of the person being tested was enough to roughly gauge their root bone.

"Wu Ping, Grade C, lower tier. You may pass."
"He Haikuo, Grade D, middle tier."
"Qian Ningning, Grade D, lower tier..."

Root bones were divided by the Qingyuan Sect into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Anyone with a C-grade root bone had the qualification to enter the mountain.

There are many factors that determine talent, and root bone is just one of them. Having a C-grade root bone means you have a ticket to the world of martial arts.

Even so, only one or two out of ten people have a C-grade or higher root bone.

Just the first hurdle would likely filter out eighty percent of the people.

Above Grade A?

That would all be lumped together as Grade A, upper.

"It's not necessarily accurate, but most people with a blue destiny or higher have successfully passed."

Li Mo was in line, his Eyes of Destiny always active.

"Miss, come up here."

The old woman in front beckoned.

Ying Bing walked out from the crowd and immediately drew countless gazes.

It was because she was too beautiful...

Standing there, cool and aloof, she seemed to create a bubble of silence around her, making her impossible to ignore.

Li Mo rubbed his chin.

According to his experience reading novels, if nothing unexpected happened, there were two possibilities.

Either she was a complete prodigy, or she was a complete waste.

With a great destiny, there was no way she could be just one of the crowd...

"Hiss..."

As expected.

The old woman's brow furrowed instantly.

She became much more serious, her energy sinking to her Dantian, her robes stirring without wind. She was actually going to use her internal energy to check the girl's root bone.

The commotion here made everyone look over.

Even the other stewards became curious.

They didn't need to be so serious even for testing a Grade A root bone.

The next moment, the old woman steward's voice rang out across the entire area:

"Ying Bing, Grade A, upper!"

Her tone was complex, filled with astonishment and excitement.

The crowd erupted in an uproar.

Those with Grade A, upper资质 were few and far between in the history of the Qingyuan Sect.

Even the famous prodigy of the Ziyang Prefecture, Murong Xiao, was only barely Grade A, lower.

And for that, Murong Xiao was still ranked as the number one genius in the last ten years.

Li Mo: "..."

So it was the former.

Being the center of attention under all sorts of gazes, Ying Bing became the center of the crowd.

The girl herself, however, was neither happy nor sad.

Because she knew this was nothing.

The reason she was Grade A, upper was because the Qingyuan Sect's highest grade was only Grade A, upper.

"Unmoved by praise or criticism. That kind of temperament is also truly rare. I look forward to your performance on the Ascending Heaven Stairs."

The short, stout elder couldn't help but sigh in admiration.

The bone check was only to eliminate those who were not qualified to practice martial arts.

The true comprehensive test of talent was the second hurdle.

The Ascending Heaven Stone Stairs!

Root bone is not the entirety of talent, but with just a Grade A, upper root bone, this young girl's performance on the second hurdle couldn't possibly be bad.

The entrance ceremony had only just begun.

The champion had likely already appeared.

Ying Bing nodded and stood among the group of those who had passed.

The pride and arrogance on the faces of the少年s and girls who had passed the first hurdle vanished silently.

They had been thinking about how to enter the inner sect.

Ying Bing was at least a true disciple.
