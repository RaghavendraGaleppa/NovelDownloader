# Chapter 106: Tathagata vs. Six Energies Mastery

By the shore of the fiery red lake, Zhou Chengru, Cui Chongxuan, and their three companions had also spotted Li Qingyue and Qin Ming's group.

The atmosphere instantly grew tense. The individuals on the opposite side were highly vigilant, their gaze fixed on the immaculate and graceful Li Qingyue. Furthermore, their attention was almost entirely focused on her, barely glancing at Qin Ming and the three Golden-Armored Guards.

Core disciples of the Outer Realms understood each other well. In the past two years, Li Qingyue had risen too fiercely, establishing a powerful deterrent force. Though she appeared to possess ice-like skin and jade bones, with an ethereal immortal charm, in a confrontation, she would sweep all before her, crushing many powerful disciples along the way. Over the past two years, her real and astonishing battle achievements had cemented her unshakeable core status.

Zhou Chengru's expression was solemn. He came from a significant background; his master was of an extremely high generation, and his master's senior brother—who was Cui Chonghe's master—was an old senior renowned throughout the Night Mist World, completely unafraid of Li Qingxu's master.

Although Cui Chongxuan wasn't familiar with Li Qingyue, he had seen her before, and combined with the influence of his millennium-old family, he deeply understood the extraordinary nature of this core disciple.

"We can ignore the others; in a moment, we'll focus our main attack on Li Qingyue!" someone beside Zhou Chengru said.

"Li Qingyue's four Golden-Armored Guards will be easy to deal with," someone else chimed in. They all practiced special energy arts, giving them ample confidence.

Another added, "But we can't be careless. First, we'll blast through those four with lightning speed and quickly send them packing."

Undoubtedly, they underestimated Qin Ming's group, treating them as mere appetizers.

Li Qingyue stepped forward lightly, saying, "Zhou Chengru, since this is a competition between core disciples, how about just the two of us sparring? The victor proceeds, the loser is out—it would be perfectly fair."

By the crimson lake, Zhou Chengru shook his head. He certainly couldn't accept such a challenge. No one wished to face Li Qingyue alone, and besides, the team Cui Chonghe had assembled for him was very strong. How could he cripple his own advantage, using his weakness to attack his enemy's strength? He smiled faintly, "Senior Sister Li, since the elders of our respective families have set the rule allowing four Golden-Armored Guards into the field, it holds deep meaning. This, too, is a part of one's strength."

"Then let's begin!" Li Qingyue declared without hesitation, her silver armor gleaming even more brilliantly, reflecting the fiery red, glowing lake. She appeared valiant and heroic.

"The three of you just need to simultaneously surround and attack one person; don't worry about the others," Qin Ming whispered to the three Golden-Armored Guards beside him.

If anyone else dared to say this, the three would undoubtedly feel it was a profound disrespect. However, this 'Tathagata Abandoned Disciple' — or rather, 'Jade Purity Energy' inheritor — commanded their respect because he was simply too fierce, and thus, qualified to speak this way.

Qin Ming shouted towards the opposite side, "We are fellow cultivators on the Path of the Newborn. Can we have a friendly exchange here? If not, then we'll have a serious competition."

Someone on the other side chuckled. Although they were extremely wary of Li Qingyue, they had long since studied her followers and knew they could be easily dealt with. "To be honest, except for you, who looks unfamiliar, we know the ins and outs of your group. Any one of us could probably punch through all four of you."

Qin Ming's spirits immediately lifted. "Alright," he said, "how about we give that a try? If you can't punch through the four of us, then let's sit down and discuss the Dao, and forget about the core disciples' business."

"What are you thinking? Let me send you home first!" an 'Outer Saint' spoke, taking a single step that brought him close, as if he had teleported. He did this because he saw Li Qingyue about to engage Zhou Chengru and wanted to quickly deal with her followers.

This Outer Saint was indeed not simple. Fully activating his Skyglow Energy, he actually emitted a tiger's roar. Behind him, a black tiger formed from condensed baleful qi, faintly manifesting.

"Careful, that's Black Tiger Baleful Energy!" the female Golden-Armored Guard behind Qin Ming shouted. After Skyglow Energy condenses baleful qi, its power can significantly increase, even doubling. Clearly, this was no 'New Saint.' He had been in this domain for at least two years or more, only then could one integrate Earth Fiend or Fire Essences.

As the woman shouted, the two had already clashed. Moreover, Qin Ming didn't use his Overlord's Halberd, meeting the attack bare-handed. He didn't underestimate his opponent. Over ten types of Skyglow Energy merged into one. With his left fist and right palm, in an artistic and natural flow, there was also an overwhelming dominance capable of seizing dragons and subduing tigers.

His left fist smashed forward, shattering most of the opponent's Black Tiger Baleful Energy. His right palm brushed lightly, and the man was struck as if by lightning, his hands covered in blood. His so-called tiger claws were torn off, all his fingernails detached. With a crackling sound, the man's fingers completely fractured, and his body trembled, having been struck by some immense force. Then, like a scarecrow, he flew backward over ten meters. He coughed up large mouthfuls of blood, his face pale, and he staggered to his feet.

"Very strong!" Qin Ming commented. His Skyglow Energy had merged into one, and for this person to still be able to stand after being hit was indeed extraordinary, making him quite the master. However, these words sounded different in the ears of those on the opposite side. Was this naked mockery?

Crack!

Bone-cracking sounds came from both arms of the very young Outer Saint. The Skyglow Energy Qin Ming had infused finally finished erupting. His two arms couldn't be lifted. The fractures had even spread to his shoulders, with fine cracks appearing in his scapulae, terrifying him! "I can't go on. I can't fight anymore," he said with a pale face.

At the same time, by the lake, Li Qingyue and Zhou Chengru had engaged in battle. A storm of spiritual light and consciousness raged between them, causing the crimson lake to surge with waves, and fiery mists to crash skyward.

Cui Chongxuan and the other two glanced deeply at Qin Ming, then charged together towards Li Qingyue, intending to help Zhou Chengru injure her.

"Didn't you say you were going to punch through all four of us? Are you going to reverse that now? And I haven't even stepped into the Outer Saint realm yet, so you guys aren't up to par!" Qin Ming used the 'Grass-Skimming Flight' movement technique, his feet seemingly not touching the ground, like a wisp of smoke, charging into the battlefield and immediately blocking one person. His right hand glowed as he used 'Adhesive Energy' to latch onto the man. Without entanglement, he abruptly hurled the person dozens of meters away, sending him splashing into the fiery red lake.

"Senior Brother Zhou, hold on, we'll deal with him first," Cui Chongxuan said to Zhou Chengru. He saw that Qin Ming was difficult to provoke, and if they didn't take him seriously, problems could easily arise if the opponent launched a sneak attack from behind.

"Who exactly are you?" Cui Chongxuan demanded. He confirmed that this person had indeed not yet stepped into the Outer Saint realm, being in the Newborn stage just like him, or even lower in cultivation, which made him terrifying. For someone in the Newborn stage to fight an Outer Saint was not something an ordinary person could achieve. He must possess extraordinary talent and practice the renowned Skyglow Energy Art.

"Look closely, who do I resemble?" Qin Ming stood by the lakeside, facing the two individuals alone.

"I don't care who you are!" The expert who had fallen into the lake climbed ashore, his body surging with Skyglow Energy, extending more than a foot beyond him, and he charged again.

Qin Ming pointed one finger to the sky and one to the ground, his gaze sweeping all around, a smile on his face. This sight caused the youth charging like a giant elephant to suddenly halt.

"Tathagata Abandoned Disciple?!" he exclaimed in shock, his face changing. The Elephantine Energy within him became somewhat unstable. According to legend, the Tathagata Energy completely suppressed their lineage's energy arts, rendering them unable to gain an advantage. Their ancestors had even served as guardians outside the mountain gate of that very lineage.

"Seeing me, yet you still won't retreat?" Qin Ming said calmly.

"You're an abandoned disciple, not the legitimate inheritor! Why should I retreat?" The tall youth recovered his wits, his Elephantine Energy surging as he stomped the ground, charging forward.

This time, Qin Ming didn't 'throw the elephant.' Since he had drawn several people over, he had ample time to calmly strike at the opponent's Elephantine Fist. During this process, Cui Chongxuan and another person also made their move. This was no time for a fair duel.

Qin Ming's entire body erupted with Skyglow Energy, as if he had donned a layer of divine armor. With his left hand, he brushed aside Cui Chongxuan's exceptionally brilliant, sun-like fist, while his right hand struck at the tall youth who intended to clash head-on with him. It must be said that Cui Chongxuan's Six Energies Mastery Energy brought immense pressure upon Qin Ming. That dazzling fist smashing into his left hand caused his body to tremble violently. Though his qi and blood churned, he still managed to withstand the blow. Not long ago, he had integrated various body-protecting cultivation arts, such as Vajra Armor, Golden Light Shield, Golden Silkworm Art... even the Blazing Fire Marvelous Art had protective applications.

His right hand continued to strike, causing the tall youth to constantly vomit blood. His Elephantine Energy collapsed, his hands became bloody, and all his finger bones fractured. Most terrifyingly, an inexplicable force spread along his arms, causing his arm bones to shatter, followed by his scapulae, and then it expanded towards his chest.

"It really is... Tathagata Energy!" The tall youth was horrified. His Elephantine Fist was useless, naturally suppressed. His chest was in excruciating pain, and most frighteningly, his internal organs were bleeding. He was sent flying, crashing into the fiery red lake. Clearly, Qin Ming had gotten serious this time. After all, when facing Cui Chongxuan's Six Energies Mastery Energy, he had to first eliminate the interference from others.

"Quickly, get him out of here and find someone to treat his injuries, otherwise his five vital organs will be severely damaged!" Cui Chongxuan said.

The youth who had earlier had both his arms broken by Qin Ming, and who practiced Black Tiger Baleful Energy, endured his pain and entered the lake to rescue the injured person. Then, the two quickly disappeared. Cui Chonghe was very eager for that legendary item, and the people he found were all masters. Otherwise, with Qin Ming's terrifying Skyglow Energy, he would have long since blown them apart.

As he clashed with Cui Chongxuan, another person attempted to attack him. Li Qingyue's three Golden-Armored Guards tried to block this individual, but surprisingly couldn't stop him, showing how strong he was. Qin Ming didn't dodge. He activated his Golden Silkworm Art, which had mutated after integration, for defense, and took a solid palm strike to his back.

"You..." The attacking master was greatly astonished. Not only was Qin Ming unmoving, but more crucially, golden threads interwoven on Qin Ming's body surface cut his palm, drawing blood. When his other hand landed, it even triggered a reverse surge of golden threads, like strands of silk, which pierced him like golden needles, making his palm bleed profusely.

Cui Chongxuan's Six Energies Mastery Energy indeed caused Qin Ming considerable trouble, otherwise, he wouldn't have chosen to endure these two palm strikes head-on. After severely injuring the master who wielded Elephantine Energy, he freed up one hand and moved his feet at extreme speed, aiming to take down the person behind him.

"That's not Tathagata Energy!" Cui Chongxuan, hailing from a millennium-old family with close ties to Outer Realm cultivators, naturally knew many secrets and formed his own judgment.

Qin Ming's left palm swept again, blocking Cui Chongxuan's Six Energies Mastery Energy. Then, his right fist, as white as jade, smashed towards the youth who had struck him twice, saying, "You, too, can try my Jade Purity Energy!"

"Argh..."

The youth screamed. He was so violently shaken by the terrifying Skyglow Energy that his hands became a bloody mess, and his finger bones fractured into many pieces. At the same time, his arm bones and scapulae exploded in succession, emitting continuous bone-cracking sounds. Then his collarbone shattered, and blood continuously flowed from his neck. He flew backward over ten meters, his five vital organs all injured, his mouth full of bloody foam. He struggled to get up, saying, "I can't hold on anymore! If I don't find someone to heal me, I'll die!" Without any hesitation, he turned and fled.

By the fiery red lake, Li Qingyue had wounded Zhou Chengru.

On the other side, Qin Ming had clashed with Cui Chongxuan multiple times, gradually adapting to the incredibly fearsome Six Energies Mastery Energy.

"I never imagined that someone in the Newborn realm could shake my Six Energies Mastery Energy!" Cui Chongxuan was profoundly shocked, his golden armor clanging. Full of heroic spirit, he once again spread his Six Energies Mastery Energy throughout his entire body.

" 'To ride the rectitude of heaven and earth, to manage the transformations of the six qi, and thus wander in the boundless...' You've practiced it incorrectly!" Qin Ming said.
