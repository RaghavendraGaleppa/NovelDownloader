## Chapter 43: Mutual Prey

Under the night sky, towering mountains stood sentinel. The dense forest was already bustling with people, their voices somewhat noisy.

The newborns from various villages were extremely indignant. Entering the mountains today was destined to be dangerous; once they entered the special nodes, life and death would be unpredictable.

"What's all this noise? Who dares to speak out of turn again?" A Golden Rooster Knight appeared, his face expressionless, his cold gaze sweeping over everyone.

The golden rooster he rode was fierce, letting out a high-pitched cry in response.

The Golden Rooster Knight chided, "You'd better behave yourselves! We're just asking you to explore for ore. Why so much nonsense? Shut your mouths and do as you're told!"

The newborns from the various villages dared not voice their anger. If not for their wives, children, and elderly, they would truly want to fight him to the death, because his words were utterly inhuman. Ordinary people now knew that the Heavenly Light would severely erode the body within special nodes.

"Let's go. A word of warning: whoever dares to cause trouble for me, don't blame me for being ruthless!" the Golden Rooster Knight threatened.

Beside him was a large group of people, fully armed and armored, all newborns from Golden Rooster Ridge. They herded the crowd along like prisoners.

They proceeded in silence, arriving outside the Great Rift Valley. Some villagers were already waiting there, brought by members of the Three-Eyed Sect. The two local organizations had indeed teamed up.

The Great Rift Valley was vast, crisscrossed by fissures. Some areas were piled high with large rocks, with sparse vegetation, a landscape of stone forests coexisting with gullies. Few creatures usually ventured here, as one could easily fall into a fissure with a slight misstep.

Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect had brought a large force this time, having waited here for a long time, not planning to explore for ore themselves.

"Oh?" In the Great Rift Valley, another Golden Rooster Knight saw Qin Ming, and a sinister glint flashed in his eyes. He had once led men to Old Man Liu's house, intending to forcibly buy the fiery-red little grass. Qin Ming had later reported this directly to Cao Long and Mu Qing, resulting in this knight receiving several slaps, losing several teeth on his right side.

"Later, give that boy some extra 'care'. Make sure he actively explores for ore!"

He didn't dare to act directly, after all, Cao Long and Mu Qing had warned him, and they hadn't left yet. But this time, the orders came from the great bandit of Golden Rooster Ridge and the high-ranking officials of the Three-Eyed Sect, instructing these villagers from outside the mountains to enter the nodes. He could "take advantage of the situation," a casual order would be enough to torment to death someone who had only undergone one stage of rebirth.

Among the villagers, a white-haired elder worriedly said, "I hope we can find the so-called mysterious produce quickly, otherwise, over time, even if we are newborns, we will develop chronic illnesses, or even be unable to leave this place!"

"Shut up, did I tell you to speak?"

With a *crack*, the Golden Rooster Knight lashed out with a whip, sending the elderly newborn stumbling. His clothes were torn across his chest, and his face, where it was grazed, bore a bleeding gash.

"Those who find the mysterious produce can not only leave immediately but will also receive a substantial reward. Note: it's not Night Silver; you'll be given Day Gold!"

Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect didn't completely push everyone to a dead end. At least for now, they offered hope and made promises.

An elder from Golden Rooster Ridge walked over and instructed, "You all go underground. This area has been occupied by us and the Three-Eyed Sect. The entire underground of the Great Rift Valley is now exceptionally valuable. Search carefully!"

Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect occupied the area near the entrance, which wasn't a particularly good position, as their strength was indeed inferior to those from Crimson Cloud City.

Qin Ming followed the other newborns underground. Everyone carried sunstones they had prepared in advance, as the fissures were too dark otherwise.

This was an underground cave system with many spiderweb-like passages extending in all directions. Some areas glowed faintly, making it unbearable to approach, while others were relatively dark, where staying wouldn't cause discomfort.

"Everyone, I don't think we need to risk our health, or even our lives. Even entering those glowing areas will make it difficult to find mysterious produce. We might as well find some safe paths underground first, enter the dark areas, and just bide our time..." an old man suggested.

In fact, many people had this idea.

A middle-aged man spoke, "Let's split into two groups. One group can pretend to search for mysterious produce, while the other quickly looks for an escape route, those deep passages, preferably leading out of the Great Rift Valley. I think these groups might eventually fight amongst themselves. Different factions, vying for special nodes, will clash and go berserk."

"Exactly, let's prepare early!" Everyone nodded in agreement.

Qin Ming had originally wanted to suggest that these people hide first. Now he realized that those who lived by foraging in dangerous mountains had a strong sense of self-preservation.

Afterward, he began to act alone, roaming the entire underground cave system, searching for possible mysterious produce.

An hour later, the outsiders had not yet clashed amongst themselves, but another powerful force intervened, and bloodshed erupted on the surface.

On the surface of the Great Rift Valley, ape cries and tiger roars echoed, and various mutated creatures appeared one after another. Many fierce birds in the sky began to dive.

"The variants are attacking!" shouted a Golden Rooster Knight guarding the entrance to the Great Rift Valley.

Previously, there had been mutated creatures, and conflicts had occurred, but never this many, nor were they organized. Now, it was completely different.

A white giant bear, five to six meters tall, led the charge. It was unknown if it had just woken from hibernation, but it was incredibly violent, seizing two newborns and tearing them apart. On the other side, a golden giant ox spewed flames from its nostrils, rampaging, impaling many members of the Three-Eyed Sect with its horns and flinging them into the air.

There were not a few such variants; though different species, they did not fight among themselves, all charging towards the humans.

The mutated birds of prey in the sky provided support; a massive silver eagle swooped down, ripping open the skull of a second-stage newborn on the spot.

"Before, there were only a few variants, no large-scale appearances. They were waiting for us to enter, specifically to hunt us down."

An elder from Golden Rooster Ridge spoke, leaping up and catching a twice-mutated horned owl in mid-air, snapping its neck.

"What should we do?"

Many people were distraught because the entrance to the Great Rift Valley was blocked by a large number of variants, who were rushing into the valley, with birds of prey monitoring from above.

***

"Something's wrong. The surface is chaotic. We need to hide quickly, use rocks to block those hidden passages, and conceal all escape routes."

In the underground world, the hunters from various villages, hearing the commotion, reacted with extreme sensitivity and moved quickly.

Qin Ming noticed this immediately. He was fearless; he could retreat towards paths where Heavenly Light overflowed. Neither Golden Rooster Ridge, the Three-Eyed Sect, nor the variants could delve deeply into such places for long.

On the surface, the large forces of Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect gathered together to defend. At this moment, hearts were filled with panic, as variants were everywhere in the wilderness.

"Higher-level creatures wouldn't personally intervene, as they promised the high-ranking officials of Crimson Cloud City that they wouldn't hunt secretly. But sending some mid-to-lower-level variants over? That's definitely no problem."

This implied a severe problem. Everyone understood that the variants had long wanted to attack and had been waiting for an opportunity.

Blood snakes, silver camels, fiery-red little grasses, and other things in the mountains were incredibly valuable to outsiders, containing rich spiritual substance. And in the eyes of the variants in the mountains, some two-legged beasts with deep foundations also made them envious, considering them "herbs" rich in spiritual substance.

"So, a large group of variants came, not just coveting mysterious produce, but also wanting to hunt us, viewing us as spiritual beings?"

"Exactly!"

Instantly, the faces of the newborns from Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect turned incredibly grim. Their territory was at the mountain pass—weren't they bearing the brunt of the attack?

"The higher-level creatures deep in the mountains dare not let their subordinates wipe out everyone who entered the mountains. That would completely enrage City Lord Lingxu and others, leading to ruthless retaliation. But reducing the number of newborns here by a fifth or a quarter? That's probably fine."

For a moment, everyone's faces turned pale. If things continued to develop this way, it would be disastrous; many were destined not to leave the mountains alive.

"Let's retreat into the caves. We can't stay on the surface. Our two factions alone are no match for these variants!" an elder from the Three-Eyed Sect said.

"Go, quickly, go underground!" These people immediately acted.

They used the narrow passages for defense. Under such easily defensible terrain, the variants found it difficult to break through.

However, the underground passages were like a spiderweb, and some variants, naturally adapted to underground combat, were finding ways, trying to bypass and kill their way in with other mutated creatures.

For a time, both the surface and underground were in chaos.

Many newborns from Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect rushed into different passages, hoping to find a way out of the Great Rift Valley. After all, this was the exit area.

***

"What a coincidence?" Qin Ming saw a familiar face: the Golden Rooster Knight who had tried to forcibly buy Old Man Liu's spiritual substance and had shown him malice at the valley entrance.

"It's you?" This Golden Rooster Knight had already abandoned his mount and was wandering alone in the underground passages, searching for an escape route.

"Come here!" He beckoned to Qin Ming, saying, "Have you found any mysterious produce? Also, you heard the commotion above. What's the terrain like here? Tell me in detail."

Qin Ming was too lazy to respond, walking over unhurriedly.

"Are you looking to die? So slow! I'm talking to you!" The Golden Rooster Knight's eyes flashed with fierce light.

His malice was evident. He had earlier wanted to arrange for Qin Ming to explore more ore, forcing him to die from constant Heavenly Light erosion. Now, he felt it would be fine to kill him directly here. Who would know? Afterward, it could just be blamed on the variants, with no witnesses.

So, he didn't bother to hide it, even lashing out with a whip. He guessed that it must have been this young man and Old Man Liu who had complained to Cao Long and Mu Qing, as they were the only two involved.

Qin Ming naturally couldn't let himself be hit, blocking with his long-handled dark gold hammer.

"You dare to resist?" His eyes were cold, and he was about to strike again.

Qin Ming had no habit of being passive. How could he tolerate him crossing the "red line" again and again? Fast as lightning, he thrust the large hammer forward.

With a *bang*, the Golden Rooster Knight saw stars and felt unbearable pain. The dark gold hammer made intimate contact with his mouth and nose. His front teeth fell out, his nose collapsed, he felt dizzy, and almost fell to the ground.

"Sorry, my hand slipped. Couldn't get a grip on the hammer handle," Qin Ming said.

"You... you son of a b-!" The Golden Rooster Knight's voice whistled after losing his teeth. Overcome with rage, his words were unclear as he cursed.

Enduring the pain in his face, tears and snot streaming, anger surged from his heart, and malevolence welled up in his guts. He drew a long saber, intending to cleave the young man.

He was a second-stage newborn, naturally believing he could handle with ease and kill a boy who had only undergone one stage of rebirth.

However, before his long saber could even strike, his right hand was seized by a tearing pain. It had been smashed by the long-handled dark gold hammer, turning bloody and mangled. The saber directly fell to the ground. His entire right hand convulsed, fractured and twisted, much like the claw of the golden rooster he rode.

"You used this hand to give Old Man Liu that 'yellow mud palm,' didn't you? Then you can also taste my dark gold fist." Qin Ming wasted no more time, lifted the long-handled dark gold hammer, and delivered several thudding blows to his face, instantly turning it into a squashed mess. His forehead bone was caved in, and he fell to the ground, a corpse.

Before he died, this Golden Rooster Knight couldn't believe it. How could this be so absurd? He was a second-stage newborn, how could his strength and speed be inferior to that boy's? In his fading consciousness, he understood: the other party was already a second-stage newborn, and far more powerful than him!

Qin Ming dragged his corpse into a very open area where Heavenly Light flowed. Relatively speaking, it was very safe here for now.

"Hmm?" He sharply turned, seeing an old man emerge from another passage, silently approaching him.

"Who are you, what are you doing?" The old man's face was grim.

"I'm from the Three-Eyed Sect. I just saw this man overcome by Heavenly Light and passed out, so I'm saving him," Qin Ming replied.

With a *boom*, the old man stomped, shattering the hard ground, and rushed over fiercely. A faint white light emanated from his body—this was Human Heavenly Light, indicating he was clearly a third-stage newborn.

He wasn't so easily fooled. Upon detecting something amiss, he immediately acted, dealing a fatal blow even to a young man.

Qin Ming knew he had encountered a formidable enemy, an unprecedentedly powerful opponent. He had never fought against a third-stage newborn before.

"I'll risk it! If I can kill a grand master like you, a third-stage newborn, I might just be able to wipe out all of Golden Rooster Ridge's forces here!" Qin Ming resolved, deciding to go all out and kill the old man.
