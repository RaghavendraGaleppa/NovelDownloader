Chapter 111: Scheming Hearts and Colorful Robes

Walking for more than ten miles with a horse in tow, they passed through dense forests. As the sunlight slanted down and a fresh breeze blew, the obstructive forest miasma gradually thinned.

Finally, a small path suitable for carriages and horses appeared.

The road ahead suddenly opened up.

The two mounted their horses and rode side by side along the path.

Li Xian held the reins, gently stroking the horse. It was a chestnut-red steed with lustrous fur, a plump and sturdy build, and an exceptionally spirited appearance.

"Commander Li, this horse will be yours from now on," said Ding Hu, his voice filled with envy.

Li Xian nodded. "I wish to know about the recent affairs of the manor. Please inform me."

"I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare," Ding Hu said respectfully. "Commander, ask anything you wish, and I will answer without reservation. I truly do not deserve the word 'please'."

"Then speak," Li Xian said casually.

Ding Hu proceeded to report everything about the manor's situation, big and small. Recently, the manor had been busy with many affairs: external enemies disturbing the peace, refining precious elixirs, and struggles for power—all were present.

After riding another ten miles, the road was paved with crushed stone and sprinkled with sand. Upon reaching the official road, travel became even smoother. Li Xian gently squeezed the horse's belly and shouted, "Heave-ho!" The horse's hooves flew, and its speed was astonishing.

With his robes fluttering in the wind, Li Xian felt incredibly畅快 (carefree). He rode to the top of a mountain, pulled the reins, and brought his horse to a stop. Gazing at the scenery of heaven and earth, an infinite sense of emotion swelled in his heart.

"No matter what the Madam's intentions are..."

"Whether the road ahead is good or bad, I have taken another step forward. Heaven rewards the diligent, and man is the master of his own fate!"

Li Xian's heart was calm.

He saw that the rivers and landscapes were still the same, but the people had changed. His younger brother had gone to the Prefecture City, Commander Pang's whereabouts were unknown, and he himself had inexplicably become a commander.

"Commander Li, please hurry on your way," Ding Hu said cautiously.

"Alright," Li Xian replied, turning his horse and heading back toward the manor.

When they arrived at the manor's gate.

Hua Hanying was just about to leave the manor. When he saw Li Xian return, his heart jolted.

Early that morning, he had suddenly heard rumors that the Madam had issued an order last night, calling Li Xian back to the manor to serve as commander. He naturally didn't believe it. His commander position was secure; why would the Madam suddenly replace him with Li Xian?

This matter was completely baseless.

But as the rumors spread, his suspicions grew.

Hua Hanying wanted to seek out the Madam for clarification. However... such an act would be presumptuous. He had been commander for several months but had only met the Madam three times.

Everything within and outside the manor, up and down, belonged to the Madam. If there were truly a change, the Madam would decide with a single word, without needing to inform anyone.

And so...

He was both self-conscious and arrogant, suspicious yet disdainful. A mix of emotions churned in his heart. It was at this moment that he saw Li Xian returning to the manor...

"Stop!"

Hua Hanying's blood boiled. He was like a starving tiger defending its territory, his anger impossible to restrain. The more he feared, the more arrogant he became; the more he panicked, the less he knew when to advance or retreat.

He said, "Ding Hu, you have such audacity! Without my permission, you abandoned your post. As a first-class guard, how dare you set such an example for everyone?!"

Ding Hu was not intimidated at all and said loudly, "I am acting on the Madam's verbal order. There is no need to report to you. Moreover, Hua Hanying, the current commander is Li Xian. You'd better recognize your own status!"

"Nonsense!" Hua Hanying roared. "Those are just baseless rumors. If the Madam had issued a verbal order, why would she call you instead of me?"

Ding Hu replied, "It's simply because I was patrolling the inner courtyard last night and happened to pass by. The Madam then gave the order, telling me to invite Li Xian back overnight."

Hua Hanying said, "No, that's impossible! Your words are unfounded. You must be the one spreading the rumors! The Madam has no reason to make Li Xian commander. It makes no sense. What are you plotting?!"

Ding Hu sneered. "Hua Hanying, I can't be bothered to argue with you. Get out of the way! If this gets ugly, you'll be the one to suffer."

Hua Hanying, enraged, strode forward and grabbed at Ding Hu, shouting, "Get off your horse! Receive the manor's punishment!" Ding Hu was startled. His ankle was already caught, five finger holes appearing and oozing fresh blood.

Ding Hu's internal energy surged back, but it was like a mud ox entering the sea—completely ineffective. Hua Hanying yanked hard and pulled him off the horse. Ding Hu cried out in shock and anger, "Hua Hanying, you dare?!"

Hua Hanying sneered, "As a great commander, what would I dare not do?!" His next strike aimed for Ding Hu's face, intending to ruin his features.

Li Xian gripped his sword handle. The blade left its sheath in an instant, and a flash of刀光 (sword light) swept by. A severed arm flew high into the air. The internal energy within the severed arm gave it a residual power even after being cut off. It landed on the ground, its fingers digging into the soil.

Hua Hanying's right arm was in agony, and he let out a miserable scream. Blood spurted for a moment, then the flow slowed noticeably. He had touched the threshold of "Blood Solidification," but such a level of skill was nothing before Li Xian.

"You... you cut off my hand?! My hand... it's gone?!" Hua Hanying clutched his severed arm.

Ding Hu scrambled to his feet and kicked Hua Hanying in a fit of rage. Hua Hanying, still unaccustomed to the pain of his severed arm and unable to defend, was kicked several zhang away.

Ding Hu clenched his fists, mounted Hua Hanying, and rained down blows left and right, roaring, "You? You're a dog-piss commander!"

The commotion here was not small, and people had already gathered to watch.

The guards, seeing the situation, knew the rumors were true. They immediately thought, "This Hua Hanying has provoked the new Commander Li several times. He's truly courting death. Let's take this opportunity to beat him thoroughly to show our stance."

And so, a one-on-one fight turned into a mob beating.

The situation grew increasingly out of control. Fists flew indiscriminately, with varying force, and they actually beat Hua Hanying to death.

"Li Xian, is it? The Madam has an order. If you have returned, go to the front of the Quiet Heart Pagoda and wait for the Madam to come out of seclusion," said Qiu Yue at the entrance of the inner courtyard.

Li Xian asked, "Miss Qiu Yue, may I ask why the Madam has summoned me back?"

Qiu Yue saw Li Xian's simple clothes, took a half-step back, her expression filled with disdain. She said impatiently, "I don't know either. The Madam has given an order, just do as you're told."

Li Xian walked into the inner courtyard and waited at the foot of the Quiet Heart Pagoda.

The Quiet Heart Pagoda was ten zhang tall, entirely black, and stood towering and majestic.

In front of the pagoda was a courtyard landscape, with misty willows, pond water, rockeries, and flowers...

"The Madam's thoughts are truly unpredictable."

Li Xian waited for a long time, feeling extremely bored but unable to leave. He looked around for some amusement. He walked to a side of a pond, inside which were multicolored fish swimming freely in the water.

He gently stirred the water, thinking to himself:

"This Quiet Heart Pagoda is the Madam's place of seclusion. It's serene and quiet, allowing one to focus one's mind."

"I wonder... what kind of seclusion is the Madam in?"

He couldn't help but think of the initial scenes of the "Azure Cloud Palm."

He waited until evening. Qiu Yue went up the pagoda. Another half-hour passed, and the Madam, dressed in a white gown, descended the pagoda and appeared in his view.

Li Xian went forward to greet her. "Greetings, Madam. May I ask why you have summoned me?"

Madam Wen nodded slightly. "Your martial arts skills have improved."

Li Xian replied, "In the deep mountains, with nothing else to do, I enjoy studying martial arts."

"Good," Madam Wen nodded. "Come with me."

They arrived at an inner room.

Madam Wen sat in the main seat. With a slender finger, she pointed to a side seat and said, "Sit." Li Xian wanted to say, "I'm fine standing," but then he thought that being大方 (generous) and straightforward might not be disrespectful. So he sat in the side seat.

Madam Wen crossed her legs. Her gown was slightly wrinkled, and a bit of skin on her wrist was exposed, showing what looked like rope marks.

Her graceful and charming demeanor needed no刻意 (deliberate) display; it was natural and captivating. She said, "You must be wondering why I called you back."

"I don't like to beat around the bush. I say what I mean. I reward merit and punish fault."

"It's because of your younger brother, Li Xiaofan."

Li Xian's heart tightened. "What happened to my brother?"

Madam Wen's lips curled into a slight smile as she said softly, "Your brother is fine, don't be nervous. He has captured a strand of fortune and is now a Xiucai."

"That's wonderful!" Li Xian said.

"With the status of a Xiucai and having captured a strand of fortune, his family members will also rise with him," Madam Wen said meaningfully. "I called you back to give you a choice. Right now, my manor is short one commander. If you choose to stay, the position is yours."

"If you wish to leave, I will not stop you. I will even do you a favor and write a letter of recommendation for you to join a power in the Prefecture City. Be it a guild, an academy, a sect, or a noble family, I can put in a good word for you."

"If you truly go to the Prefecture City, you will be closer to your brother. It's possible you might even meet often."

"You are still young, and there's no reason you can't make a name for yourself. If you truly make something of yourself, the situation will be completely different. After all, with a brother like him, you too can rise. Give it some careful thought."

Madam Wen spoke lightly and easily, her words sounding very tempting.

Li Xian had no fondness for the manor, and hearing about the Prefecture City, he was indeed tempted. However, upon second thought, he was struck by a sense of fear.

He analyzed in his heart:

"Who is the Madam? She is selfish and powerful. Any decision she makes must be for her own benefit, for her to gain something."

"She is sending me to the Prefecture City, which sounds very tempting. But... what good does this do for her? Investing in me? That's wishful thinking."

"Therefore... she speaks so beautifully, it's probably just empty talk. And she has already promoted me to commander, which proves she never intended to let me leave the manor."

"In that case, the purpose of her words is to... test my loyalty. If I wanted to go to the Prefecture City, it would mean my heart is not here!"

Li Xian's thoughts flashed in an instant, and he blurted out, "The Prefecture City is good, but... but Li Xian would rather stay in the manor."

"Oh? Why?" Madam Wen asked with great interest.

"Commander Pang often said that the Madam is a celestial being. To be able to serve by your side is a great blessing."

Li Xian did not feel ashamed. The way of survival was like this; one's backbone was in one's heart, not in one's words. "I think Commander Pang is right. I was born in Qingning County. Although I have never been to the Prefecture City, I imagine it's just a larger town, with more people and more liveliness. Compared to that, I would rather stay by the Madam's side."

Hearing the phrase "a celestial being," Madam Wen knew it was praising her beauty as that of a fairy. Although she felt no joy, it was pleasant to hear. Seeing Li Xian's sincere expression, she nodded inwardly.

"How old are you this year?" Madam Wen asked.

"Sixteen," Li Xian replied.

"Have you ever left Qingning County?" Madam Wen asked.

"Never!" Li Xian's literary talent was not as good as his brother's, but his wit was no less. "Ah! I went out once, to Huangyu County."

Madam Wen chuckled. It was a captivating and beautiful sight. She said, "You are quite honest."

She looked Li Xian over, thinking to herself: "This child is quite transparent to me. The fact that he went alone to save his brother shows his character. He is also loyal to me, has never been in the Jianghu, is clean, and has not seen the world."

"The important thing is that his brother, at just over ten years old, captured a wisp of fortune. This Li Xian... might truly be worth cultivating."

After considering all these factors, Li Xian was clearly different. In Madam Wen's heart, guards were just guards, and even Commander Pang was just a guard. She could use both the carrot and the stick to make them serve her for life.

Naturally, there was no real affection, and she would not cultivate them.

But that wisp of thin "fortune" was enough to change many perspectives.

It made some things微妙 (subtle).

With this "fortune," Madam Wen began to take Li Xian seriously and saw these优点 (merits). This slight difference was something Pang Long, with his lifelong loyalty, could never have earned.

"Since you are unwilling to leave the manor, from today on, you are the commander."

"Come to the inner courtyard at noon the day after tomorrow. I will teach you a superior martial art."

Wen Caishang was in a good mood.
