# Chapter 140: Treasures and Oddities, One’s Own Support

Yang Hua tempered the body, refining skin and flesh, causing the physical form to sublimate and reach a new level.

Unlike the "Essence Cleansing," this directly enhanced his physique.

The Qi Lake reached twelve zhang deep.

Half an hour later.

Li Xian lightly leaped, jumping into the lake. He washed his body clean, his spirit invigorated—a feeling hard to describe by words.

Palms holding divine mechanisms, shoulders draped in rainbow clouds, chest echoing with thunder...

This was the same level Commander Pang had achieved back then.

The next day.

Before dawn had broken, Li Xian had already risen. With his Divine Manifestation and Yang Hua Body Tempering, along with many divine attributes added to his body, he was brimming with energy.

He rested only two hours a day.

He led the guards in their morning training. He delegated miscellaneous matters to Ding Hu to arrange. After organizing everything, he rode out of the manor toward Qingning County.

A new official must assert their authority.

On the West Street of Qingning County, there was an abandoned hall.

It was the "Martial Commander Hall."

More than a decade ago, Qingning County had produced a Martial Commander, selected due to military merit. However, that Commander ended up in a tragic state, unable to suppress the local forces, and ultimately met a ruinous end, his family destroyed.

The Martial Commander Hall had been abandoned for a long time.

Li Xian rode his horse to the hall entrance.

Not only was the interior abandoned, but weeds grew everywhere, and vines twisted around the structures. Two moss-covered stone lions lay horizontally, blocking the gate.

"Is this meant to be a show of force?" Li Xian sneered inwardly. Seeing the traces of movement on the two stone lions, it was obvious they had been moved last night.

It was meant to indicate that Li Xian was not allowed to enter the hall.

The streets were bustling with a flow of people. On the balconies of wine towers, inside tea houses, in front of bun shops, and among the pushcart vendors... many places had people secretly observing, gloating over his misfortune.

Li Xian possessed the Heavy Pupil. Even without opening it fully, his observation was meticulous, and his vision was supreme. He walked straight toward the two stone lions.

He raised his left palm and struck. The left lion slid sideways back into place. He kicked with his right foot, and the right lion shifted back into position. The two obstructing stone lions were subdued. Li Xian walked straight into the hall.

Once he was far away.

Scouts from the street came to investigate, all eyes wide with astonishment. The two stone lions were perfectly aligned, returned to their original positions.

The left lion had a palm print an inch deep, and the right lion had a foot print an inch deep.

Furthermore... these stone lions had been inserted with "heavy iron cores" by the various martial arts schools last night to increase their weight.

To still achieve this level of power, this new Martial Commander was definitely not a soft persimmon.

The forces in Qingning County were complex, consisting of three schools and two sects.

Namely:

"Xiong Pi Martial School," "Man Shen Martial School," and "Chun Ye Martial School."

"Snake Walk Sect" and "Red Copper Sect."

They had dominated Qingning County for many years.

The Leopard Blade Sect was an outsider, a strong dragon that suppressed the three schools and two sects into silence. But that was no longer the case now.

A coffin lay横 in front of the sect's gate. The disciples of the sect had scattered in large numbers. The three schools and two sects had regained their former prestige, tyrannizing the countryside with arrogance.

At this moment, the leaders of the three schools and two sects were discussing the "Martial Commander" matter in a wine tower.

None of them wanted to be suppressed by a mere youth.

The Xiong Pi Martial School's "Iron Bear" was tall and burly, with body hair like a bear. When he sat down, it was hard to tell if it was a bear spirit transforming into a human or a human turning into a bear spirit.

He said loudly, "Everyone, what do you all think of this newly appointed Martial Commander? We are all martial artists, so let's speak directly."

The Chun Ye Martial School's master, "Miao Xichun," though a man, had a slender waist. His triangular eyes hid a sharp glint as he smiled and said, "This young master is so young, yet he cut off the enemy general's head amidst ten thousand soldiers. Could his martial arts be so supreme that he is a one-man army?"

His words were dripping with sarcasm.

The leader of the Snake Walk Sect, "Mei Ren Du," sneered, "Heh, at his age, to have such strength, I absolutely do not believe it."

"What times are we living in? Does the matter of killing enemies for merit still exist? In my opinion, this boy has some background. He deliberately fabricated a story to get an official position."

"Brother Mei speaks reason. To be honest, I think so too," shouted Zhou Long of the Man Shen Martial School. "The Huanglong Army's supplies are exhausted. I suspect... there must have been a mutiny in the army. They cut off the general's head and came to defect to the imperial court."

"As for cutting off the enemy general's head amidst ten thousand soldiers. Heh, none of us saw it, so he can say whatever he wants."

"These little tricks, haven't we all used or seen them?"

Everyone voiced agreement, all nodding in approval.

"If that's the case, this boy has some background after all, and it's not convenient to target him directly. Everyone, I have a wonderful plan. Not only can we test this boy, but we can also进退自如 (come and go freely)."

The leader of the Red Copper Sect was a woman named Hu Shengnan.

"Oh? There is such a wonderful plan? Please tell us quickly, Sect Leader Hu," Mei Ren Du asked curiously.

Hu Shengnan said, "Everyone, have you forgotten what the Martial Commander's duties are?"

"Of course not," everyone replied.

"We can use a counter-plan to find out about that boy," Hu Shengnan said proudly. "As a Martial Commander, he should mediate disputes within the county. Let's deliberately create a dispute and have the Martial Commander mediate."

"Then, how much weight he carries will be immediately clear. If he really has ability, we will weigh it ourselves and then make plans. If he has no ability, then naturally, we do as we please."

Everyone understood. This plan was flawless and was an open scheme. Yet, it was unsolvable.

"According to Sect Leader Hu, what kind of dispute should we create? It's best to make a big scene so he can't save face," Iron Bear laughed.

Hu Shengnan frowned. Creating a dispute also required balancing the interests of all parties. It needed the three schools and two sects to participate, so no one could stay out of it.

She had a sudden idea, "I have it. I have a plan, but I'm afraid it will inconvenience Master Miao."

Miao Xichun's heart skipped a beat. He had a bad premonition and cursed inwardly, *So the trap was waiting here.*

Hu Shengnan said, "I heard that Master Miao obtained a treasure recently? Let's use this [Treasure] as the reason to create a dispute over it."

Miao Xichun's face turned ugly. He did have a "treasure." He had hidden it very well, but a disciple saw it and the news leaked.

From then on, it attracted the covetous eyes of all sides. If Miao Xichun hadn't been famous for decades, having been to the prefecture city and made a name for himself, which still held some weight today.

He would have had people knocking on his door to snatch it long ago.

"Master Miao, the treasure is yours. We are just borrowing its name. We aren't actually抢夺 (snatching it). You aren't that stingy, are you?"

"Master Miao, we see each other often. We must consider the big picture."

Everyone's eyes sharpened, voicing their support.

Miao Xichun knew everyone's nature well. If he agreed, a fake snatch would turn into a real one. It would kill two birds with one stone: deal with the Martial Commander and snatch the treasure.

If he refused... he would still face the same situation.

He had to grit his teeth and agree, playing it by ear. "Everyone is right. I am willing to do my part!"

"Hahaha, good."

"Master Miao is righteous."

"Master Miao's martial arts are superior to ours, and his broad-mindedness is truly something we cannot match!"

Everyone smiled broadly and offered flattery.

Martial Commander Hall.

"Brother Lin, I must thank you again."

Li Xian cupped his fists and smiled.

Lin Guolong stood on a low stool, standing on tiptoes to barely stand level with Li Xian.

More than ten runners were tidying up the hall. They moved away abandoned wooden tables and chairs, pulled up weeds by the roots, and cut vines in half.

Li Xian didn't need to lift a finger for these tasks.

"It's nothing, nothing. Brother Li, since your hall is short-handed, I'll send over a dozen or so men later."

"But... the salaries of these runners are not paid by the court. How to command them is up to you to solve."

Lin Guolong said meaningfully.

The Great Martial Empire was in turmoil everywhere, and the treasury was empty. Sometimes the County Magistrate couldn't even get his salary. Among the runners in the yamen, only a few, who inherited their positions through generations, were qualified to receive salaries from the court.

The rest of the runners never received a salary. Their income relied entirely on their "runner uniforms," borrowing the tiger's might to extort money from merchants in the market.

The people lived in misery, suffering unbearably.

From this, one could see the clues.

Li Xian frowned. If he wanted to command the runners, he had to allow them to use the "Martial Commander" banner to extort money from the people. If he cherished his reputation and didn't want to be tainted by them.

The runners had no salary, how would they work for him?

It wouldn't be long before they dispersed. Unless Li Xian paid them himself.

"By the way, Brother Li, this is your salary for this month." Lin Guolong took out a cloth bag.

Inside were three taels of silver.

"You are an official now. You need to be savvy. These meager salaries are really not important."

"Don't you have several shops?" Lin Guolong laughed.

He understood the inside tricks clearly. It seemed he wanted to teach Li Xian how to invent reasons and extort money.

Li Xian thought: *In these chaotic times, only by doing this can one live comfortably. But I am unwilling to become such a person. It makes me unhappy.*

He smiled and said, "Brother Lin, could you please pick five new runners for me?"

"New ones?" Lin Guolong patted Li Xian's shoulder. "Why new ones? I'll give you ten veteran runners. They are experienced and easy to command."

Li Xian knew that veteran runners had been wandering the streets for decades, with dark records and a habit of extortion. These runners were naturally easy to use. You didn't need to pay them; you could just order them around. They were good at flattering superiors and could please people.

Precisely because of this, he didn't want veteran runners. "No need, I'd rather have some new runners. Young and strong."

"You don't understand the way of being an official," Lin Guolong sighed, shaking his head. "Fine, fine. They are all new, they don't know the rules. I'll arrange an old hand to help guide you."

Li Xian was speechless. This Lin Guolong was indeed enthusiastic. Regardless of other things, he treated Li Xian quite well. "No need, no need. I have experience in this regard. Brother Lin, don't forget, I was the commander of Yihe Manor."

"Oh, that's right. Alright then," Lin Guolong nodded and kept this in mind.

Once the Martial Commander Hall was cleaned up, Lin Guolong took the runners and left immediately. He went to the runner office to select young runners from the roster.

In the afternoon.

The Martial Commander Hall was extremely quiet.

Li Xian was practicing martial arts in the hall.

"Martial Commander大人 (Sir)!"

"Zhang Hou, reporting for duty."

"Wang Wu, reporting for duty."

Suddenly, voices were heard. The five runners arrived as scheduled. Their cheeks were thin, their eyes clear. They had just become runners and still retained their ambition.

Li Xian put down his sword and said loudly, "Good. You will work under me from now on."

"I have something to tell you first."

"Working in the Martial Commander Hall, you must not bully men and women, you must not oppress the people, and you must not extort money."

"As for salary... I will pay it. Three hundred copper coins a month. Occasionally... I will also bring you some dry rations."

Li Xian had calculated.

Before leaving the manor every day, he would take some dry cakes and coarse grain from his wife's vegetarian restaurant. It wouldn't be hard to support five runners.

If he paid the salary himself, he wouldn't need to exploit the people.

Now, in Qingning County, he had his own team and merchants.
