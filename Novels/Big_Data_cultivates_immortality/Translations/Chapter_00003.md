# Chapter 3: When It Comes to Fortuitous Encounters, Go Big or Go Home  

At eight in the evening, the time when most people in Zhengyang were having dinner, Feng Jun left his dormitory and headed to a small, unassuming eatery tucked away in an alley—a place he frequented.  

Though Zhengyang was a city with a high cost of living, even in first-tier cities, there were always affordable hole-in-the-wall restaurants hidden in the backstreets. On a normal day, Feng Jun would be satisfied with a large bowl of fried noodles, a plate of cold tofu, and a chicken leg—a meal that was already quite substantial by most standards.  

But tonight, he ordered three large bowls of fried noodles, two vegetable dishes, five chicken legs, and even splurged on a plate of husband-and-wife lung slices before finally feeling like his stomach wasn’t completely empty. To top it off, he drank two large bowls of noodle broth—what he called "sealing the gaps"—before finally feeling somewhat full.  

After paying via WeChat QR code, he waddled out of the restaurant, completely ignoring the owner’s bewildered stare.  

However, the moment he stepped outside, Feng Jun froze. "Huh? WeChat payment… but I can’t get into the space?"  

It seemed his top priority now was figuring out what benefits this fortuitous encounter could bring him.  

First, though, he needed to understand how this encounter had even happened. Had his phone changed, or had *he* changed?  

Sitting under the glow of a streetlamp, he examined his phone in detail, then glanced at his left hand—he was left-handed, and that was the hand holding the phone when he got electrocuted. His left palm was slightly swollen, though he couldn’t tell if it was from the lightning strike or from repeatedly exclaiming *"wocao"* (holy shit).  

At first glance, nothing seemed particularly unusual. But when he turned his wrist, he was shocked to find a faint, bluish mark on the inside of his forearm, near the back of his hand.  

"Damn, my stone ring is gone?"  

Three years ago, during a university internship, Feng Jun had gone on a trip to Bingzhou with his roommates. Deep in the Longshan Mountains east of the city, they had explored a secluded valley. There, among the ruins of an ancient pagoda forest said to be over a thousand years old, Feng Jun had picked up a dark blue-green stone ring.  

The ring was oval-shaped, about two centimeters in outer diameter with a three-millimeter inner diameter. It felt cool to the touch and was surprisingly heavy, almost as dense as iron. Though unremarkable in appearance, it had one special quality—it remained refreshingly cool even in the summer.  

Feng Jun had originally picked it up as a casual trinket, expecting to lose it eventually. But when he brought it back to Jiangxia University, he realized how much relief it provided in the sweltering heat. The cooling sensation was subtle, perhaps even psychological, but since Feng Jun hated the heat, he decided to keep it. He threaded a red string through it and wore it on his wrist, never taking it off, even when showering.  

Now, the stone ring had mysteriously vanished—along with the red string. Given the faint mark on his wrist, Feng Jun had reason to believe that the ring had undergone some… *transformation* after being struck by lightning.  

He couldn’t quite articulate what that transformation was, but he suspected the ring had somehow merged with his body.  

This explanation was wildly unscientific, but hey—when it comes to fortuitous encounters, go big or go home! If you could explain it scientifically, would it even *be* a fortuitous encounter?  

Having pieced together the sequence of events, Feng Jun promptly dismissed the idea of investigating the ring’s origins—he doubted he’d stumble upon another one anytime soon. Instead, he focused on figuring out what benefits this encounter had bestowed upon him. Hopefully, it wasn’t just the ability to exclaim *"wocao"* in shock.  

First, he needed to find a secluded spot—somewhere without people or surveillance—to retrace the steps of his earlier experience. He wasn’t sure whether his consciousness alone had entered the QQ Farm space or if his physical body had disappeared along with it. In a city crawling with surveillance cameras, a person vanishing in front of a camera could lead to unnecessary trouble.  

Feng Jun hated trouble, and he certainly didn’t want his newfound opportunity snatched away by someone else.  

Luckily, such a place wasn’t hard to find—for example, the restroom at the Hongjie Club.  

That afternoon’s lightning strike had fried the transformer outside the club. Fortunately, the club had its own generator, which was now rumbling away as evening fitness enthusiasts trickled in. Feng Jun hadn’t shown up for work that afternoon, and while his coworkers knew, no one stopped him from using the restroom—after all, even random passersby could pop in to use the facilities.  

The restrooms at Hongjie Club were upscale, befitting the establishment’s image—each stall had a door that could be locked.  

Feng Jun entered one and spent half an hour inside before emerging with a grim expression.  

Nothing. The fortuitous encounter was gone. Absolutely nothing happened. Even when he reopened QQ Farm, he couldn’t re-enter that mysterious space. Frustrated, he could only plant a handful of grass seeds and wait for them to grow, hoping he might be able to *"wocao"* them again later.  

For those thirty minutes, he had tried everything, but alas, his old flip phone remained just that—an old flip phone. No surprises, no miracles.  

The battery had dropped to 83%, and the percentage symbol’s two zeros seemed to stare at him mockingly, as if saying, *"I’m just a phone, dude. You’re overthinking this."*  

But Feng Jun wasn’t one to give up easily. He refused to believe the earlier experience had been a hallucination.  

*Something* must have happened that I missed!  

As a double-degree graduate, he wasn’t lacking in investigative spirit. In fact, he relished challenges.  

Quickly regaining his composure, he headed for the exit. Just as he was about to step outside, a stunning woman in her thirties strode past him with quick, purposeful steps.  

She was tall—around 170 cm—with a curvaceous figure accentuated by a light brown office-style summer outfit. The hem of her knee-length pencil skirt revealed smooth, bare calves and a glimpse of her thighs.  

She wasn’t wearing stockings—a bold choice for a woman her age, speaking volumes about her confidence in her legs.  

Feng Jun stopped and greeted her respectfully, "Good evening, Sister Hong. Working late?"  

The woman was none other than Zhang Weihong, general manager of Hongjie Culture & Entertainment Co. She preferred being called "Sister Hong" over "Director Zhang," and rumor had it the club’s name was a play on her nickname.  

Sister Hong wielded considerable influence in Zhengyang, and her background was shrouded in mystery. A beautiful woman thriving in the entertainment—*ahem*, cultural and sports—industry was clearly no pushover.  

Some said she had opened the fitness club as a private hangout for her close friends—a place where they could relax without reservations while staying in shape.  

At Feng Jun’s greeting, Sister Hong barely glanced at him, treating him like air before briskly walking past.  

Feng Jun wasn’t bothered. The higher-ups at the club were always aloof, and everyone was used to it. Sister Hong was known for her arrogance; words like "kind" or "motherly" were antonyms in her dictionary.  

Back in his dorm, Feng Jun spent another two hours fiddling with his phone until the battery dropped to 40%. He tucked it under his pillow and drifted off to sleep, his last thought being: *I need to buy a charger tomorrow.*  

Yes, he had already decided—he would go to work as usual the next day.  

Why? Simple. He couldn’t be sure whether his fortuitous encounter was tied to this room. Until he figured it out, leaving rashly would be a mistake.  

Compared to this opportunity, the frustrations of work were trivial.  

---  

The next morning, Feng Jun arrived at the club early to prepare for the day—turning on the air conditioning and water dispensers, inspecting cleanliness, and touching up any spots that needed attention.  

By 7:30 a.m., a handful of members had already arrived for their morning workouts.  

As Feng Jun headed out for breakfast, the receptionist, a young woman surnamed Li, walked in and called out, "Hey, Double Degree! Getting breakfast? Grab me something too!"  

The nickname "Double Degree" was slightly teasing, but at least it wasn’t as mocking as being called "Postgrad."  

Feng Jun hesitated—not because of the nickname, but because he suddenly remembered the reception desk had a charger for guests. Staff occasionally used it too.  

But in the end, he didn’t ask to borrow it. He was planning to buy one anyway—why scrounge for small favors?  

After breakfast, he brought a meal back for Xiao Li. By then, it was nearly 7:50. His own breakfast had been twice his usual portion, yet his poor old phone hadn’t been so lucky—its battery was down to 12%, unlikely to last the morning.  

Some members were already leaving for work. As Feng Jun made his rounds, he noticed sweat stains on one of the treadmills and promptly wiped them down.  

After cleaning the machine, he took the rag to the staff room to wash it. There, on the windowsill, he spotted a light green phone charger.  

This garishly colored charger belonged to Liu Shuming, a fellow employee who had once boasted, *"Green isn’t just a color—it’s a lifestyle. You losers wouldn’t understand the mindset of a successful man."*  

Since it was *his* charger, Feng Jun saw no reason not to use it. He plugged one end into his phone and the other into the wall socket.  

**BANG!**  

A loud explosion, sparks flying.  

Outside, someone yelled, *"Wocao! The transformer just got fixed—how’d it blow again?!"*
