# Chapter 170: An Old Acquaintance from the Past

The underground spirit well was eerily quiet. The four members of the Gongsun family were utterly dumbfounded. If they hadn't misheard...

Did someone just... burp?

Was that from being too full?

"Burp~ Hic~ Hic~ Hic~"

This time, they heard it clearly. Old Six's hiccups had become an addiction, the aftereffects kicking in intermittently, each hiccup perfectly timed with rhythmic cadence.

Lin Shan was equally helpless. Hiccups were beyond his control—his meridians were stuffed to bursting with excessive spiritual energy, and his dantian vortex could no longer contain the surging power. He needed to refine and compress the energy quickly to continue absorbing it.

From the depths of the spirit well came several resentful voices, cold as the waters of the underworld.

"Brother Lin, this is hardly fair..."

"Even as an envoy of the Demon Sect, you can't bully people like this, can you?"

"Taking the meat is one thing, but not even leaving us a sip of soup?"

"Hiding away to feast alone—aren't you afraid of choking?"

Lin Shan had known exposure was inevitable, just not this soon. He could only mumble evasively, "I was just testing the waters for you all—hic~ Next time, I'll only take twenty percent, no more than that—hic~ You have my word."

The four gritted their teeth, cursing Lin Shan inwardly but suppressing their anger for the sake of their family's greater plans. They'd make him pay in a few months.

From then on, Lin Shan strictly kept his promise during the spiritual tide, only taking sixty percent without further mischief. The Gongsun quartet, having tasted some benefits, stopped complaining. Since they couldn't verify the total amount, they had no choice but to compete for the remaining spiritual energy and heavenly dew with their own methods.

---

Two months later, Lin Shan tirelessly refined and compressed the spiritual energy in his dantian.

His cultivation had now reached two-thirds of the mid Foundation Establishment stage—a result of relentless compression and refinement. Unable to absorb any more, he used a formation to condense the excess spiritual mist into liquid, storing it in gourd artifacts for future use.

Most crucially, his innate talents had improved. After two months of transformation by the heavenly dew, his wind spiritual root had risen to "Grade B," while his thunder spiritual root reached the peak of "Grade C."

He was now a genuine "minor genius." A "Grade B hetero spiritual root" was standard for core disciples even in major sects, further accelerating his cultivation speed.

As for comprehension, there was no precise measure—it would reveal itself through his future mastery of techniques and insights.

By this time, the heavenly dew had gradually diminished and ceased altogether. After all, this was only a mid-tier spirit vein; one couldn't expect too much. The spiritual tide, however, persisted and would likely continue for most of the year.

Lin Shan had planned to cultivate straight through to peak mid Foundation Establishment. Why return to the frontlines as cannon fodder when he could slack off and cultivate safely here?

But then his conch artifact vibrated. This one-time communication tool had been specially crafted by Black Skeleton Demon Monarch, part of a pair—the other held by his allies outside.

Lin Shan immediately halted his cultivation, activating the conch while casting a soundproofing barrier to prevent eavesdropping by the Gongsun family members in the other spirit well chambers.

Black Skeleton's voice came through, accompanied by faint footsteps and breathing—likely his subordinates gathered around.

"How's your cultivation down there, brother?"

"Quite well, like a fish in water," Lin Shan replied cheerfully.

Black Skeleton paused, seemingly surprised that Lin Shan was thriving while they'd been on edge aboveground.

"Through certain channels, I've learned that the Gongsun family recently hosted an unfamiliar Golden Core cultivator. Their patriarch and grand elder even emerged from seclusion to receive him."

"What?!" Lin Shan was startled. At this critical juncture, a Golden Core cultivator's sudden visit, coupled with the Gongsun family's Golden Cores ending their seclusion, suggested something significant had happened in the Great Song's situation.

"Have you learned anything about the outside situation? How's the frontline? Still deadlocked?"

Old Zhong's voice came through next: "We last reported to the United Command half a month ago. Since then, we've lost contact. The Gongsun family has also tightened security, confining us to our quarters with no access to outside information."

Lin Shan frowned. "They're practically placing us under house arrest. How dare they detain a Demon Sect envoy? Since when is the Gongsun family so bold?"

Old Zhong sighed. "We argued, but their attitude hardened abruptly these past two weeks. They won't let us roam their estate, though they still treat us courteously otherwise. We didn't want to disturb your cultivation..."

Lin Shan's heart sank. The Gongsun family's sudden shift suggested something was amiss. With no way to gather intel, the situation was a complete mystery.

"Do you know who this Golden Core visitor is?"

"The Gongsun family called him 'Realman Mang,'" came the reply.

"Realman Mang..." Lin Shan racked his brain. This definitely wasn't someone from the Demon Sect—otherwise, they would have inquired about the envoy's whereabouts, and the Gongsun family would have notified them.

A neutral faction, then? Unlikely. With the war at its peak, most powers were lying low. Why would anyone visit now?

Moreover, the Gongsun family was currently enjoying their spirit vein tide—they'd want to keep it secret, not invite outsiders. Unless... they had no choice.

"Just now," Black Skeleton interjected gravely, "the Gongsun family activated their clan-protecting grand formation. Light barriers erupted everywhere, sealing the entire estate—no one can leave!"

"What?!" Lin Shan felt a chill. A clan-protecting formation was a last-resort defense, akin to a sect's guardian array. Covering dozens of miles, its activation consumed vast spiritual stones and was only used in dire emergencies.

For the Gongsun family to activate it now, coupled with the mysterious Golden Core's arrival...

Lin Shan quickly connected the dots: the visitor was likely from a major righteous sect. At this critical moment, only a Golden Core from either faction could provoke such a response.

It seemed the Gongsun family's loyalty wasn't as steadfast as Protector Yan had claimed a millennium ago. After so many generations, allegiances shifted—especially for clans whose only true loyalty was to themselves.

Righteous? Demonic? They'd side with whoever had the bigger fist.

Something must have happened outside to sway the Gongsun family's stance.

Lin Shan broke into a cold sweat. This was no time to stay put. As precious as the spirit vein tide was, survival came first.

His wind spiritual root had reached Grade B, his cultivation was two-thirds into mid Foundation Establishment, and he'd stockpiled spiritual liquid. The remaining months of the tide weren't worth risking his life for.

"The righteous faction must be preparing something major, and it's about to unfold."

The conch artifact began cracking—the communication limit reached. His subordinates clamored anxiously:

"Sir, what should we do?"
"Should we flee now?"
"With the Gongsun family's sudden moves, if we don't leave soon—"
"The outside world's cut off. We might be trapped if we delay."

Lin Shan didn't hesitate. "Stay put for now. Don't alert anyone. Wait for me in the pavilion—we'll escape together."

*Crack—* The conch shattered, its purpose served.

After a moment's thought, Lin Shan dismantled his formations, recycling the materials. He then set up a decoy spirit-gathering array and illusion formation with Xiao Xin's help. The original array had used the Void Star Disk as its core; this makeshift version was just for show, meant to fool the four Gongsun youths into thinking the Demon Sect envoy was still cultivating below.

How long the ruse would last wasn't his concern.

Once ready, Lin Shan quietly left the spirit well chamber. Ten li up the tunnel, he found the exit sealed by another formation.

His newly honed Phantom Spirit Eyes discerned the formation's workings, but actual dismantling was beyond him—that was Xiao Xin's job.

The little girl puffed her cheeks in mock scolding before effortlessly unraveling the formation in five breaths. They emerged into the underground hall.

The grand hall was unchanged—rows of bronze pillars stood solemnly under dim light, its ceiling formations maintaining the spirit vein's stability.

Lin Shan wasted no time. Another formation blocked the exit to the surface, likely Gongsun Lu's additional precaution. Just as he prepared to bypass it...

The two stone rhinos flanking the hall suddenly stirred, their eyes glowing red. The hall trembled slightly as rocks fell from above.

*Moo—*

A deep, resonant bellow filled the chamber, amplified by the confined space, nearly deafening Lin Shan. The roar carried soul-shaking properties.

The rhinos' stone hides cracked and shed, revealing muscular bodies with gleaming white horns. Their eyes burned with primal fury as they charged.

"Demon puppets!" Lin Shan recognized them instantly—corpse puppets crafted from demon beasts, retaining 60-80% of their original strength. The Gongsun family had clearly stationed them as guardians.

The twin-horned rhinos barreled toward him. Lin Shan calmly flicked his sleeve, summoning a golden flying sword—a high-grade artifact with three inscriptions, looted from a royal elder in Bianliang.

The sword shot forth but was deflected by the rhinos' horns with metallic *clangs*, leaving only faint scratches.

Lin Shan frowned. These creatures were tough. Rather than waste energy, he opted for the simplest solution.

With a wave of his summoning banner, the Foundation Establishment peak Water Bear leader emerged with a roar. Bean soldiers sprouted into Pea Demons, Golden Peachwood Demons, Sunflowers, and Chrysanthemum Demons, forming a lively entourage.

Lin Shan leisurely produced a chair, had two Sunflowers massage his shoulders, and pulled out melon seeds from his storage bracelet. As he snacked, he watched the spectacle—his minions ganging up on the rhinos.

The Water Bear leader wielded a Demon-Binding Rope like a whip and a Cloud-Subduing Banner as a cape, putting on a flamboyant show that even drew Xiao Xin from hiding, her eyes wide with excitement.

Fifteen minutes later, the rhino puppets lay in tatters. The smug Water Bear leader shot Lin Shan a sidelong glance—prompting Lin Shan to order the plant demons to teach it who was boss.

Amid the chaos, ripples formed at the hall's exit as the formation parted. A silver-robed woman in a bamboo hat stepped through, freezing at the scene before her.
