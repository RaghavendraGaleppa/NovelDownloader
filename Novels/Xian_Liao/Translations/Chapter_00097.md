# Chapter 97: Cloud-Parting Palm

After dealing with the Grassland Martial Saint, Zhou Qing and his three companions no longer had any visible human opponents left in the mortal realm. As for demonic creatures, even entities like the Ghost Vine—unless they had grown to terrifying levels—could be easily escaped by someone like Fu Song.

If such creatures did reach that level of development, they would inevitably cause massive disturbances, which would then require the four of them to join forces again to handle.

Moreover, as long as they avoided venturing alone into deep mountains or encountering demonic beasts like the Crane or Blood Python, there were virtually no threats left in this mortal domain that could endanger them.

With that settled, the remaining matter was the five beast-skin maps that needed to be pieced together. Zhou Qing was in no hurry to visit the cave abode of the legendary Master Jingyang. He decided to wait until the three elder Daoists had fully absorbed the benefits of the elixirs they currently possessed. There was simply too much for them to digest, and rushing would serve no purpose.

Next, Zhang Jingxiu planned to return to Mount Taihe to enter seclusion, vowing not to emerge until he had broken through to the second level of body refinement. Meanwhile, Fu Shan and Fu Song intended to guard the northern imperial capital. Fu Shan also aimed to study the imperial medical texts extensively to further elevate his medical skills. Zhi Shan would continue accompanying the two elders.

"Until we meet again!" Zhang Jingxiu was the first to depart. As long as he wasn't near Zhou Qing, he felt nearly invincible—perhaps only slightly weaker than Fu Shan, who had been catching up to him as Zhang focused on refining his spirit. Through their frequent sparring sessions, Zhang's combat prowess had proven second only to Zhou Qing's.

"Junior Brother, you are already unmatched in this world," Fu Shan said meaningfully before leaving.

Zhou Qing smiled faintly. "That's only because there are no 'people' left to challenge me for now. On the path to immortality, our greatest adversaries are often not 'people.'"

Fu Shan nodded, relieved that Zhou Qing's perspective remained broad. He had worried that without opponents, Zhou Qing's mindset might falter, but his junior brother's vision was far-reaching.

Zhou Qing then retrieved the Grassland Martial Saint's accumulated treasures and returned to Jiangzhou with Qin De, a scout from the Martial Virtue Bureau. He felt the road ahead was long, with much yet to explore.

"Greetings, Master." Yuan Mingyue was delighted to see Zhou Qing return, though she seemed hesitant to speak.

Zhou Qing smiled. "Your Maze Formation was quite useful."

Her face brightened further. She had feared her research would prove futile, but Zhou Qing's approval was a tremendous encouragement. Even if the formation had been useless, Zhou Qing wouldn't have said so—after all, she was his only disciple skilled in formations, and her talent was undeniable.

This was akin to a husband criticizing his wife's cooking early in their marriage—doing so might mean he'd end up doing all the cooking himself. People naturally prefer praise. Even Zhou Qing wasn't immune to flattery, but he reminded himself that complacency would hinder his progress.

After discussing the Maze Formation with Yuan Mingyue and gaining new insights, Zhou Qing had an epiphany. With the gradual revival of spiritual energy in the world, cultivation conditions had improved. However, martial techniques varied widely—some overly profound, others too crude. Now that the Dao Court stood unchallenged, it was time to compile a comprehensive martial scripture to elevate the disciples of Qingfu Palace and outstanding members of affiliated sects. This would better prepare them for the trials of heavenly tribulation.

Zhou Qing knew his own breakthrough to the innate realm had been aided by his unique soul, the support of the Nourishing Life Master, and rare medicinal resources. Yuan Mingyue's progress, though similar, was slower—she still hadn't mastered the essence of the Five Animal Exercises' Tiger Form. Given her talent lay in formations, Zhou Qing decided she should follow Qing Lingzi's path, focusing on her strengths rather than forcing martial progress.

Meanwhile, the Dao Court established the Demon-Slaying Bureau, with core disciples from Qingfu Palace receiving Zhou Qing's newly compiled martial scripture and fifth-grade Blood Qi Pills. The Martial Virtue Bureau was reorganized into an intelligence agency, where Qin De—remembered by Zhou Qing—was promoted.

According to intelligence reports, the Snow Region's population had dwindled to fewer than ten thousand, mostly monks. What was once a sacred Buddhist land had become a haunted wasteland. However, the esoteric Buddhist lamas insisted it was a paradise, not a hell. Under their worship, a "Bright King"—actually a ghost king—had emerged in the Great Snow Mountain's Diamond Temple. Though powerful, the lamas dared not let it roam freely, lest it go berserk. To sustain it, they abducted people from neighboring regions, causing widespread suffering.

Zhang Jingxiu, seeking to resolve the conflict, planned to challenge the Bright King himself. He wrote to Zhou Qing, asking him to intervene if things went awry. Amused, Zhou Qing suggested Zhang first send Xiao Ruowang to Qingfu Palace—it was time to help him undergo heavenly tribulation and become the world's fifth innate expert.

When winter arrived, Xiao Ruowang brought Zhang's reply: the duel was scheduled for the following August 15th, coinciding with Zhang's birthday. He claimed the delay would allow the pine cones on Mount Taihe to fully ripen and joked it might avert Zhou Qing's inauspicious year.

With preparations underway, Zhou Qing continued refining his new technique—the Cloud-Parting Palm. Unlike the Gale God Leg's violent gusts, this palm technique manipulated water vapor with fluid precision, resembling spells. Testing it on his hardened mulberry tree, he left clear palm prints without exerting full force.

Yet, the palm alone couldn't have defeated the Ghost Vine-possessed Grassland Martial Saint. Victory had come from the Thunder Palm's demon-suppressing properties and precise strikes to joints. Zhou Qing pondered whether Master Jingyang, who left behind the Demon-Seeding Rebirth Art, had fused with a powerful demon to extend his lifespan—especially since all known demons were wood-attributed and flesh-devouring. The answers likely lay in Jingyang's cave, a prospect Zhou Qing approached with caution.

As he trained, his cultivation progressed steadily. His qi reached the peak of the sixth layer of qi refinement, nearing the late stage, while his body refinement attained the second-level peak. Compiling the martial scripture even elevated his Literary Core to high rank, hinting at a future "Sage Heart" transformation. His spiritual sense also reached the eighth layer of qi refinement.

Qing Lingzi had mentioned that a foundation-establishment cultivator's spiritual sense could overwhelm qi-refinement practitioners. Body refinement, however, grew increasingly arduous—Zhou Qing could now overpower a sixth-layer qi-refinement expert in close combat unless they wore high-grade protective gear.

Another half-year passed. The Dao Court's institutions solidified, and the world's mysteries deepened, awaiting Zhou Qing's next steps.
