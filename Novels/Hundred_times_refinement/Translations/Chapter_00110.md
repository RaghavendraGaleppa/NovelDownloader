# Chapter 60: Beast Talisman vs. Hundred Souls Banner  

Each vengeful ghost bore a terrifying visage—crimson eyes and claw-like fingers—crafted from the souls of innocent people collected and refined by Ye Tian.  

Having died unjustly, these souls were filled with malice, which in turn amplified the power of the Hundred Souls Banner.  

A chilling wind howled, accompanied by the wails of tormented spirits, yet Lin Xuan remained unfazed. He focused on channeling his spiritual power into the Beast Talisman. Unlike ordinary talismans, the Beast Talisman required more spiritual energy to activate, preventing instantaneous deployment.  

As the nine vengeful ghosts took form, Ye Tian pointed his banner forward, chanting a spell: "Go!"  

Instantly, the surrounding yin energy thickened. The ghosts, their eyes blazing red, shrieked as they lunged at Lin Xuan.  

The sight alone was enough to chill one’s soul, let alone facing them in battle. Yet Lin Xuan remained calm. Only when the ghosts were nearly upon him did he toss the Beast Talisman into the air.  

*Boom!*  

The talisman ignited, bursting into radiant flames. From within the fire came the thunderous roar of a beast, shaking the mountains and stirring up dust. A massive tiger wreathed in flames emerged.  

"A Beast Talisman—Ironclad Blaze Tiger?"  

Even Ye Tian recognized it, his face twisting in shock. Not only did this rootless commoner possess the strength of the fourth layer, but he also wielded such a rare treasure as a Beast Talisman.  

Lin Xuan’s expression darkened. He hadn’t expected his opponent to be so knowledgeable, making this battle even tougher than anticipated. Without hesitation, he directed the tiger’s spirit to charge at the vengeful ghosts.  

The ghosts howled, the demonic tiger roared. Though the vengeful spirits were steeped in malice, they were merely the souls of ordinary humans. The Ironclad Blaze Tiger, however, had been a top-tier first-grade demonic beast in life, its power equivalent to a peak Qi Refinement cultivator.  

The outcome was inevitable.  

*Roar!*  

With a swipe of its claw wreathed in pale demonic flames, the Blaze Tiger obliterated one ghost, reducing it to ashes amid terrified screams.  

Not content, the tiger lunged at another ghost, sinking its fangs into its neck before devouring it whole, licking its lips as though savoring a delicious meal.  

Though the ghosts lacked intelligence, the swift annihilation of two of their kind triggered instinctive fear. Ye Tian’s face darkened further. He had heard of Beast Talismans but never imagined their power could be so overwhelming.  

In truth, Ye Tian’s misfortune lay in two factors. First, his Hundred Souls Banner, though formidable, was incomplete. While he had gathered enough souls and used three cultivators’ essence spirits as catalysts, he had hastily refined them to pursue Lin Xuan, preventing perfect fusion with the banner and thus diminishing its power.  

Second, the banner’s nature worked against him. Though it could rival a high-grade spiritual artifact, its ghostly essence made it vulnerable to the Beast Talisman’s demonic spirit. The Ironclad Blaze Tiger’s soul was simply too potent for ordinary vengeful ghosts to withstand.  

Ye Tian quickly grasped this, his expression twisting in fury. He couldn’t afford to let his hard-earned souls be destroyed. With a wave of his banner, ghostly mist surged forth, momentarily halting the tiger’s assault as he recalled the remaining seven ghosts.  

Gritting his teeth, he bit his tongue and spat blood onto the banner. The malice within intensified as more vengeful spirits emerged, intertwining under his command to form a colossal, three-meter-tall crimson skull.  

The skull radiated a blood-red aura, its malevolence palpable.  

Lin Xuan’s eyes narrowed. Before he could react, the skull lunged. The Blaze Tiger roared and met it head-on, the two locked in fierce combat.  

Despite being formed from human souls, the crimson skull showed no fear, even gaining the upper hand against the tiger’s spirit.  

*Roar!*  

The Blaze Tiger’s soul swelled in size, but Ye Tian sneered, channeling more ghostly energy into the skull, causing it to expand as well.  

When brute force failed, the tiger unleashed a torrent of demonic flames. The skull cackled, its hollow eye sockets glowing crimson as blood-red light countered the flames.  

A stalemate ensued.  

Yet Lin Xuan’s expression remained grim. Unlike disposable talismans, Beast Talismans could be reused—but once their energy was depleted, they were rendered useless.  

Reluctant to waste such a valuable treasure, Lin Xuan reached into his robe. But before he could act, Ye Tian struck first.  

With a flick of his sleeve, a fiery serpent materialized mid-air, its forked tongue flickering with spiritual energy.  

"Strike!"  

Ye Tian pointed, and the serpent shot toward Lin Xuan.  

"A spiritual artifact?"  

Lin Xuan inhaled sharply, his brows knitting together in alarm.
