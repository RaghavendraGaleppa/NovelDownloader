# Chapter 75: Soul-Nurturing Banner  

With the great method now embedded in his heart, Han Yue had fully grasped his path of cultivation.  

At this moment, all he needed was to accumulate sufficient runic magic power and elevate his foundation as much as possible. When the time came, he would muster all his strength to climb upward, striving to form the Great Dao Golden Core and awaken supreme divine abilities!  

Han Yue still had many years before reaching the sect's required timeframe for promotion to a true disciple. He would have a long period ahead to cultivate the *Body-Nurturing Thunder Scripture*. For the first time, his cultivation had a clear goal.  

However, aside from practicing *Body-Nurturing Thunder* and *Thunder-Nourished Soul*, Han Yue still had divine abilities to master, magical artifacts to refine, and knowledge to study. His path of cultivation was becoming ever more vibrant!  

Han Yue opened his eyes, emerging from his secluded meditation. He stepped out of his cave abode and onto the platform outside.  

The night sky greeted him—bright moon hanging high, stars glittering brilliantly. Truly, time passed unnoticed in cultivation. Merely comprehending the secret technique had consumed ten full days.  

Beneath the moonlight and starlight, Han Yue took a moment to ease his tense mind. He plucked a plum and savored it, still reflecting on the process of grasping the true transmission of the great method. Delving into the intricacies of cultivation techniques would be a long-term endeavor.  

After this brief respite, Han Yue returned to his cave and began another session of secluded cultivation. With so many true transmission techniques at hand, he wouldn’t rest until he had thoroughly mastered them!  

As he resumed his meditation, Han Yue carefully reviewed the *Thunder-Nourished Soul* section of the inheritance stele once more.  

Ever since the stele had entered his sea of consciousness, Han Yue’s spiritual sense had felt stretched thin. It was the perfect time to cultivate this method for nurturing the soul and spirit.  

During the transmission of the method, Han Yue had knelt upon the *Innate Gourd Heart-Questioning Meditation Mat*, and his comprehension had soared, allowing him to grasp *Thunder-Nourished Soul* with perfect clarity. Now, as he revisited it, the method’s contents were vivid in his mind, ready for practice.  

Han Yue silently channeled his magic power, circulating it according to the *Thunder-Nourished Soul* technique.  

*Thunder-Nourished Soul* was a complementary cultivation method to *Body-Nurturing Thunder*. It could only be practiced after achieving one full cycle of *Body-Nurturing Thunder*.  

Han Yue’s *Body-Nurturing Thunder* cultivation had already surpassed this requirement. With a gentle push, he entered the initial stage of *Thunder-Nourished Soul*.  

Compared to *Body-Nurturing Thunder*, which focused on condensing runes and refining magic power, *Thunder-Nourished Soul* was far simpler. It was less a cultivation method and more an advanced application of *Body-Nurturing Thunder*.  

According to its records, the practitioner needed to guide the body-nurturing thunder runes from their circulating magic power into the sea of consciousness. Following the method’s instructions, these runes would then be woven into a *Soul-Nurturing Banner*.  

Once successfully woven, the method would be complete.  

The *Soul-Nurturing Banner* would then possess the ability to nourish spiritual sense and the soul. Additionally, since the banner was formed from body-nurturing thunder runes, it could naturally store magic power.  

A fully refined *Soul-Nurturing Banner* could accumulate vast amounts of magic power within the sea of consciousness, further stimulating the growth of spiritual sense. This was equivalent to constructing a second source of magic power within the cultivator’s body, doubling their reserves and foundation!  

After years of cultivation, Han Yue had amassed nearly nine hundred body-nurturing thunder runes. Aside from the three hundred and sixty-five runes permanently anchored in his dantian, the rest circulated throughout his body with his magic power.  

Han Yue focused his spiritual sense, locking onto one swiftly moving rune and gradually guiding it into his sea of consciousness. By anchoring this rune in his sea of consciousness, he completed the first step of *Thunder-Nourished Soul*.  

However, this rune remained unstable, constantly restless and eager to break free from Han Yue’s control. He had to expend a portion of his spiritual sense to continuously suppress it.  

Han Yue then locked onto a second rune, repeating the process. Slowly but surely, he brought the two runes together.  

As the runes connected, their resistance partially canceled each other out, stabilizing slightly.  

Han Yue continued transferring runes until he had gathered five.  

These five runes linked together, forming a small plum blossom-shaped runic array in his sea of consciousness. Once the array took shape, the runes stabilized instantly, settling quietly without requiring further spiritual sense to maintain them.  

Moreover, the moment the *Thunder-Nourished Soul* array was completed, its extraordinary effects became apparent.  

Han Yue’s thunder magic power flowed through the array, undergoing transformation by its power. A steady stream of energy emerged from the array, nourishing his soul and causing his spiritual sense to grow slightly.  

The spiritual sense that had been suppressed by the inheritance stele now regained a sliver of freedom.  

Han Yue felt as if a cool spring had appeared in his mind, continuously welling up to soothe his inner agitation. The sensation was deeply comforting and relaxing.  

Not only his spiritual sense but also his Dao heart became more vibrant, and his comprehension improved slightly.  

This five-rune array was the smallest unit of the *Soul-Nurturing Banner*. From here, Han Yue only needed to continue assembling and layering these arrays to complete the banner.  

Han Yue had officially crossed the first hurdle in cultivating *Thunder-Nourished Soul*.  

Though it seemed effortless for him, many newly initiated Shenxiao Palace disciples struggled with forming even this first array. It required not only a *Body-Nurturing Thunder* cultivation beyond one full cycle but also sufficiently strong spiritual sense.  

After resting briefly to recover his spiritual sense, Han Yue began forming another runic array.  

The first array had already rewarded him with tangible benefits—the *Soul-Nurturing Banner* visibly enhanced his spiritual sense and comprehension, greatly aiding his future cultivation. Naturally, the sooner he refined it, the better.  

One by one, Han Yue guided body-nurturing thunder runes from his magic flow into his sea of consciousness, assembling them around the first array.  

Gradually, the outline of a banner-shaped runic structure took form.  

Han Yue’s spiritual sense grew noticeably faster.  

As he continued adding runes, the *Soul-Nurturing Banner*—composed of three hundred and sixty-five body-nurturing thunder runes—was finally completed within his sea of consciousness!
