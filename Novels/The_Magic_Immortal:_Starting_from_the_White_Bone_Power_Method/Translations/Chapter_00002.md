# Chapter 2: The Law Is Not Lightly Taught  

**[Little Withering Needle's Artifact Restriction +1]**  

**Magic Artifact (1/3):** Little Withering Needle (Low-grade, Artifact Restrictions: 12/21)  

Immediately after, a familiar yet mysterious force bypassed the storage pouch's barrier and directly infused itself into the needle case.  

"Just one experience point can increase an artifact restriction by one layer. This is simply..."  

Over the past two days, Wang Chan had gained a deeper understanding of the cultivation world. Witnessing this, he couldn't help but marvel inwardly.  

This meant that if he diligently cultivated for nine more days, accumulating nine experience points, he could fully unlock the artifact restrictions of the **[Little Withering Needle]**.  

A fully restricted artifact would undoubtedly be far more powerful than it was now.  

Yesterday, when he had treated Madam Cheng with the needle at just eleven layers of restrictions, she had been unable to stop herself from moaning incessantly.  

If it were fully restricted... heh, a single needle would surely send her into ecstasy.  

Wang Chan grinned to himself, then impatiently patted his storage pouch.  

A jade-green needle case, about the size of a brick, flew out. Upon opening it, he saw nine three-inch-long needles neatly arranged inside.  

The needles gleamed silver, their tips exuding a sharp, intimidating aura.  

These needles were crafted from Silverlight Bamboo as the base material, then infused with the **[Little Withering]** artifact restriction.  

Though they appeared silver on the outside, due to his spiritual connection with them, his divine sense could perceive the intricate patterns of alternating blue and yellow—twelve layers in total—emanating faint waves of vitality and decay.  

These were the artifact restrictions. Unless he deliberately revealed them, outsiders might discern the artifact's grade but not the number of restriction layers.  

From his memories, the original owner of this body had obtained this artifact shortly after entering the path of cultivation. Over nearly twenty years, he had painstakingly refined it, expending considerable **[Greenwood Essence]** and **[Grave Yin Qi]** to barely reach ten layers of restrictions—a costly and time-consuming endeavor.  

Now, with experience points, he could directly enhance it without wasting time on refinement or exhausting resources to gather rare materials like **[Greenwood Essence]** or **[Grave Yin Qi]**.  

Wang Chan couldn't resist flicking one of the needles, producing a crisp, melodious hum.  

Suddenly, as if remembering something, he frowned.  

Come to think of it, the original owner had also practiced the **[Revitalizing Cloud-Pushing Technique]** early in his cultivation journey. Yet, after all this time, why had he only managed to refine three spell restrictions?  

In terms of potential, this technique should surpass the Little Withering Needle.  

After a brief contemplation, he couldn't help but chuckle wryly.  

The original owner's aptitude was poor, and his comprehension was equally mediocre.  

Yet, the cultivation of spells didn't require rare materials—only comprehension!  

For someone with high comprehension, mastering a low-grade spell in a year was feasible. Ten spell restrictions could be refined within three years, and perfection could be achieved in five.  

But for those with poor comprehension, no matter how much time they spent studying and practicing, progress would remain elusive.  

"Those with wealth play with artifacts; the poor grind spells."  

Wang Chan pondered this.  

But recalling his past life's college entrance exam, where he had scored a pitiful seventy-eight in mathematics, he immediately dismissed the idea of grinding comprehension for spells.  

Better to focus on diligent cultivation and accumulating experience points.  

Speaking of experience points, Wang Chan's gaze shifted to the breakthrough points.  

**Breakthrough (0/1):** None (One breakthrough point increases the chance of breaking through a major realm by 10%)  

At first glance, it hadn't seemed significant.  

But upon closer consideration, it was astonishing.  

Compared to experience points, breakthrough points were even more extraordinary.  

While experience points could enhance his combat prowess—allowing him to dominate his peers with better spells and artifacts—breakthrough points could increase his chances of advancing to higher realms!  

For someone with inherently poor aptitude like him, this was the most crucial resource, offering a chance to progress further on the path of cultivation.  

However, for some reason, the panel didn't display how to obtain breakthrough points. Perhaps certain conditions needed to be met first.  

He would cross that bridge when he came to it. The real issue was—  

**Unranked cultivation techniques cannot form a Foundation!!!**  

In other words, as long as he continued practicing the **[Mystic Turtle Breathing Technique]**, even if he became invincible in the Qi Refinement stage, he would never be able to form a Foundation. A hundred years later, he would return to dust.  

In this world, spiritual root aptitude was important, but cultivation techniques were equally vital—the two complemented each other.  

For example, a cultivator with a supreme-grade spiritual root practicing only a mid-grade technique could, at most, form a mid-grade Foundation.  

As for those with low-grade spiritual roots, their inherent limitations meant they could only practice unranked or low-grade techniques.  

Unranked techniques couldn't form a Foundation, while low-grade techniques offered a slim chance of forming a low-grade Foundation.  

If a low-grade spiritual root cultivator forcibly practiced a mid-grade technique without compensating for their shortcomings, it would be like a small horse pulling a heavy cart—not only inefficient but eventually exhausting them to death.  

Spiritual roots determined the upper limit of cultivation techniques, and the grade of the technique determined the upper limit of the Foundation.  

Thus, the importance of cultivation techniques was evident.  

For this reason, since ancient times, the cultivation world adhered to the principle: **"The Law Is Not Lightly Taught."**  

Forget about mid-grade, high-grade, or supreme-grade techniques—even low-grade techniques were difficult for rootless wandering cultivators like him to obtain without significant luck.  

Of course, unranked techniques were exceptions. These common techniques could be bought for ten spirit coins at markets like the Black River Market eighty miles away or the White Mountain City's bazaar.  

Spells and skills were similarly scarce. Even low-grade ones were rarely available for sale.  

Artifacts were relatively easier to acquire but exorbitantly priced. Most came with only one layer of restrictions, requiring the owner to refine them further to increase their power.  

This was why, after all these years, the original owner only had one low-grade spell and one low-grade artifact to his name.

**The Next Day**  

The outside was noisy, but the room was silent.  

**[You diligently cultivated for three hours. Experience +1]**  

Wang Chan awoke from his cultivation session, drenched in sweat, his expression weary and tinged with regret.  

To meet the three-hour cultivation requirement, he had used his last remaining **[Vitality Nourishing Elixir]**.  

This item was worth one spirit coin and had originally been kept by the previous owner to replenish expended spiritual energy during medical treatments.  

But for the sake of experience points, he had no choice.  

He opened his storage pouch and took stock.  

- A set of nine **[Little Withering Needles]**, a low-grade artifact with twelve restrictions.  
- One low-grade protective talisman with ten restriction layers.  
- One spirit coin and sixty-three spirit beads (one spirit coin = one hundred spirit beads).  
- Three sets of spirit-fabric clothing and shoes, two of which were already faded.  
- A few miscellaneous items of little importance.  

That was all.  

Oh, and there was also a half-empty bottle of **[Tiger Bone Turtle Essence Seven-Leaf Wine]** in the cabinet, worth about thirty to fifty spirit beads. A small cup of this could revitalize a man's vigor.  

Wait a minute—two days ago, when Madam Cheng had provoked him, he had been so vigorous he could have pierced the heavens. He definitely hadn't needed this.  

Hmm, this definitely wasn't for personal use.  

Wang Chan nodded firmly to himself.  

Additionally, the kitchen still held two pounds of spirit rice, a bundle of spirit firewood, and half a vat of spirit spring water—enough to sustain basic living for about three more days.  

"Broke as hell," Wang Chan sighed, suddenly feeling uneasy.  

A man could live without a house, a carriage, or a woman—but not without money.  

Otherwise, he'd be stuck.  

Money was a man's courage.  

Just then—  

**BANG!**  

**BANG! BANG!**  

"Anyone home?!"  

A voice like a croaking old duck came from outside.  

If he remembered correctly, it belonged to the minor leader of the Red Leaf Gang responsible for collecting "protection fees" around Lotus Mountain—a certain Zheng, mid-stage Qi Refinement, with over forty strands of spiritual energy. The man had a shifty, rat-like face.  

From his memories, the original owner had often fantasized about smashing that face in—but that was all he could do.  

"Coming, coming..."
