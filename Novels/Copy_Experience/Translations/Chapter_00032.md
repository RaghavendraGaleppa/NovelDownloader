**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Oriole Behind (Two-in-One)**

The battle grew intense. Lu Xu quickly concealed himself, not daring to make the slightest move. At a distance of fifty to sixty zhang, even a minor stir could draw the attention of the two combatants. If discovered, they might even join forces to eliminate him, the third party.

"What a fierce struggle!" Lu Xu thought, watching the battle from afar.

Mo Changkong was a Qi Condensation Layer Nine cultivator, an absolute grand master of the late Qi Condensation stage. The Black Robe Society rogue cultivator opposite him, however, appeared to be only at Qi Condensation Layer Seven. Their strengths were completely mismatched, yet they were fighting to a standstill. This was because Mo Changkong’s power had already significantly depleted after several intense battles.

His face was extremely pale, and his aura was weak. He manipulated a fiery-red short hook, upon which raging flames burned. The rogue cultivator, on the other hand, unleashed a mirror that shot out streaks of golden light. Wherever the golden light struck the ground, a dark, deep hole immediately appeared. In the clash of their magical artifacts, Mo Changkong was clearly at a disadvantage. His spiritual energy was nearly exhausted, seemingly at the end of his rope.

However, a cornered beast fights hardest, and a dying beast is the most dangerous. The Black Robe Society rogue cultivator was clearly wary of Mo Changkong's desperate last stand, not daring to press too hard, merely continuously draining his spiritual energy. At this rate, Mo Changkong would inevitably be exhausted to death.

Mo Changkong understood this truth. After a moment of fierce fighting, he suddenly roared, his hair and beard bristling, "Junior, do you truly intend for us to fight to mutual destruction?"

The Black Robe Society rogue cultivator cackled. "Old man, the fish might die, but the net might not break. You’ve already caused enough damage, killing two Qi Condensation Layer Eight cultivators of our Black Robe Society. Now, obediently go to your death!"

Mo Changkong’s face rapidly contorted at these words, a succession of expressions—fury, fear, despair, and unwillingness—flashing across his features. Finally, his expression suddenly calmed, becoming indifferent and emotionless. "Good, good, good! Either way, death awaits, so this old man won't die in vain!"

As soon as his voice fell, his pale face suddenly turned crimson, as if all the blood in his body had rushed to his face. "Bang!" With a resounding explosion, Mo Changkong's clothes disintegrated, leaving him completely exposed. Not just his face, but his entire body was a vivid crimson, like a boiled prawn. Over his heart, a red lotus imprint suddenly materialized.

The lotus imprint flashed once, and then all of Mo Changkong's blood converged towards it. The crimson hue on his skin receded towards his heart. In an instant, he became deathly pale again, with only a single lotus at his heart, vivid crimson and seemingly dripping blood. All of this happened in a brief moment, too fast for the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator to react.

"Not good!" he cried out in alarm, retreating rapidly. He knew Mo Changkong would surely launch a desperate counterattack and had been prepared since the start of the battle, having activated a first-tier high-grade Wind Screen Talisman. A wind barrier formed from a hurricane encased him, providing solid protection. However, upon seeing the blood-red lotus, an intense sense of alarm flared in his heart. He realized that the Wind Screen Talisman might not be able to withstand this attack, so he immediately retreated.

But it was too late!

The crimson lotus shot out from Mo Changkong's chest with a "whoosh!", spinning rapidly in the air as it flew towards the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator. The rogue cultivator hurriedly manipulated his magical artifact to block while frantically activating one defensive talisman after another.

"Boom!"

The crimson lotus exploded!

Following an earth-shattering explosion, a tide of crimson light surged forth, engulfing the entire area. "What terrifying power!" Lu Xu watched the crimson light from a distance, his eyes filled with shock. In his line of sight, after the blood lotus erupted, it instantly enveloped the two combatants, and the crimson light expanded rapidly outward. It ultimately formed a crimson hemisphere with a radius of more than twenty zhang. Anyone who saw it would feel the terrifying destructive aura emanating from within. After expanding to its maximum extent, the crimson hemisphere’s light flashed violently, then vanished into thin air.

Dust flew everywhere, completely shrouding the area. Lu Xu quickly activated his Spirit Eye Technique to look, only to see that the tall trees and lush green grass that had once been there had all vanished. They had been completely obliterated! The ground was bare, with rock exposed. An area of twenty zhang in radius had been leveled!

"How powerful! How powerful!" Lu Xu muttered to himself. The dust and smoke covered everything, but with his Spirit Eye Technique, he could still clearly see two figures lying on the exposed ground. Mo Changkong was tattered and broken, his blood pooled around him, already having drowned him. He appeared to be dead! On the other side, the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator was equally miserable, his clothes in tatters, one arm and one leg missing. He lay on the ground, eyes tightly shut, whether dead or unconscious was unclear.

Both their magical artifacts lay on the ground, dim and lifeless, resting quietly.

"An opportunity!" Lu Xu's heart pounded, and a surge of excitement immediately welled up within him. Both suffered grave injuries, perhaps even death. Was this not a golden opportunity to pick up some spoils? He almost immediately got up to rush out.

But he stopped himself at once. "No rush, let’s wait and see!" Suppressing the restlessness in his heart, Lu Xu cautiously observed his surroundings, focusing on the two figures lying on the ground.

"Swish!"

Just as he was observing, from another side of the forest, two streaks of light suddenly shot out, appearing almost simultaneously, rushing into the swirling dust.

"More experts?!" Lu Xu became even more cautious, quickly activating another Qi Concealment Talisman on himself. "Bang!" "Clang!" Sounds of magical combat reached him. The two new cultivators were clearly not allies; both wanted to snatch the spoils, and upon seeing each other, they immediately regarded the other as a mortal enemy.

They fought fiercely for a moment, realizing neither could gain the upper hand. After all, both were at Qi Condensation Layer Four, their strengths evenly matched.

"Fellow Daoist, let's not be hasty. Let us first confirm if these two are truly dead. After confirmation, how about we discuss how to distribute the spoils?" a white-haired old man suggested, deflecting his opponent's fierce attacks.

Hearing this, the white-robed youth opposite him gradually slowed his movements. After a brief thought, he nodded. "Fellow Daoist speaks wisely. I was too impatient!"

"Haha, this old man was also afraid of others snatching away the benefits. It's good that Fellow Daoist understands! I'll check Elder Mo's body, and you check the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator's body. Be sure to deliver the final blow!" A cunning look flashed in the old man's eyes as he proposed this.

The white-robed youth immediately shook his head. "No, I'll check Elder Mo's body, and you check the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator's body!" He wasn't foolish; everyone knew that Elder Mo's storage bag was surely more valuable than the rogue cultivator's.

As soon as he finished speaking, silence fell over the area. The atmosphere between the two instantly became tense again. After a standoff of over a dozen breaths, the white-haired old man sighed, "Very well, if that is the case, let us both go together. We'll check Elder Mo's body first, then the rogue cultivator's."

"Good!" The white-robed youth nodded decisively. Immediately, the two cultivators, guarding against each other and activating defensive talismans to erect protective shields, walked towards the two bodies.

The white-haired old man swung a small sword fiercely at Mo Changkong's body, severing his head. Mo Changkong's body showed no reaction. It seemed he was truly dead. The two exchanged glances, both nodding, and then turned to walk towards the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator's body. As they walked, they simultaneously released their magical artifacts, aiming for the man's head.

However, just as the two magical artifacts were about to reach the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator, the cultivator, whose eyes had been tightly shut, suddenly opened them wide. His sole remaining hand moved, and a red light immediately shot out from his sleeve, flying swiftly towards the two cultivators. At the same time, the previously dim and lifeless mirror on the ground suddenly flew up, continuously firing several golden lights at the two cultivators' magical artifacts.

"No! Fire Thunder Pellet!"

Seeing the red light, the white-haired old man immediately let out an extremely terrified, piercing scream. He frantically activated talisman after talisman while desperately trying to recall his magical artifact. The white-robed youth beside him made the same frantic movements, his face instantly turning ashen.

Alas! Their magical artifacts were blocked by the golden lights and couldn't be recalled, and the red light had already shot towards them. "Boom!" Following an earth-shattering explosion, flames and lightning engulfed the area. Although the display of power could not compare to the crimson lotus's earlier explosion, it was still not to be underestimated.

When the explosion's power dissipated, Lu Xu saw that the white-robed youth's body had been blown in half. The white-haired old man's body was intact, but he was covered in blood, collapsed limply on the ground, his eyes incredibly dim. "No… I can't die… family's Foundation Establishment… Xuan'er!"

Bloody foam continuously bubbled from his mouth as he struggled to mutter incoherently. A series of illusions flashed before his eyes, his life playing out like a revolving lantern. Suddenly, when he mumbled the name "Xuan'er," a burst of light erupted from his dim eyes, and he struggled to move his body. "Xuan'er's Foundation Establishment! I must ensure Xuan'er reaches Foundation Establishment!"

In a final burst of vitality, his face became grimly twisted. Mumbling the name, his trembling hand pointed. The magical artifact that had fallen to the ground, dim and lifeless, trembled as it flew up, heading towards the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator.

The Black Robe Society rogue cultivator's eyes flashed with despair at this sight. He let out a tragic laugh, blood also spilling from his mouth. He no longer had any spiritual energy to block this attack. That sudden burst just now had been his last counterattack, but unfortunately, it hadn't completely killed these two.

He closed his eyes, awaiting the arrival of death.

But the white-haired old man's attack did not accurately strike his neck. The old man's vision was already blurry, his consciousness fading, and he had only launched this attack out of sheer force of will. The magical artifact struck the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator's leg, not severing it, but embedding itself deeply and getting stuck. The rogue cultivator's eye twitched as intense pain ceaselessly assaulted him, yet he didn't even have the strength to twitch a finger.

However, his originally despairing eyes changed, and hope suddenly erupted. He was not yet on the verge of death; he had merely exhausted all his spiritual energy to defend against the crimson lotus. If he waited for a while, he could recover some spiritual energy and change his predicament. "As long as no one else comes to this place…" the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator hoped in his heart.

It seemed it was time to move in and reap the harvest! Lu Xu watched from afar, a surge of impulse rising within him. However, he still did not rush to act, patiently waiting.

After about a dozen breaths, a streak of light suddenly appeared. "Haha, why struggle to live when you two are in such pain? Let me send you on your way!" A loud laugh rang out as a short, dwarfish figure charged forth with lightning speed. Without a second word, he wielded a small purple sword, swiftly slashing towards the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator.

Although he was only at Qi Condensation Layer Three, and his magical artifact was a low-grade one, this Qi Condensation Layer Seven grand master was now completely at his mercy. The magical artifact struck precisely, and the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator’s body and head separated. The dwarf laughed and with another strike, finished off the white-haired old man, whose muttering had become almost inaudible.

The dwarf's face was filled with excited smiles, looking at the pile of corpses on the ground, even trembling slightly with agitation. What a great harvest! Who would have thought that after all these people fought, he, a mere Qi Condensation Layer Three cultivator, would be the one to snatch the spoils? Each of these individuals had a higher cultivation than him; how substantial must their wealth be? Thinking of this, his breathing quickened, and he could no longer hold back.

He quickly rushed forward, picking up all the magical artifacts scattered on the ground, collecting Elder Mo's and the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator's storage bags, and then rummaging through the bodies. Finally, he conjured a few Fireball spells, igniting the corpses. After thoroughly looting and destroying the evidence, he quickly took off, not daring to linger for a moment.

"It seems there's no one else!" Lu Xu watched this scene calmly and steadily. Even when the dwarf flew away, he didn't move, still watching.

He continued to observe his surroundings until the dwarf flew so far that his Spirit Eye Technique could barely see him. The forest was quiet, with no one else appearing.

"He's already flown this far; to catch up to that dwarf, one would need the speed of a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator!" "If there really were a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator here, they wouldn't need to hide. With their cultivation, they could absolutely sweep through this place!" After a brief thought, Lu Xu knew there couldn't be any other cultivators here. The gathering of such a group of cultivators here was already the limit; it was impossible for all the escapees to flock to this spot.

So he stopped waiting. With a flick of his sleeve, the Azure Wind Boat appeared under his feet. Mounting this magical artifact, Lu Xu soared into the sky. His speed instantly became incredibly fast, comparable even to those Qi Condensation Layer Nine cultivators. He transformed into a streak of green light and swiftly gave chase.

The moment Lu Xu appeared in the sky, the dwarf discovered him and was immediately scared out of his wits. However, the dwarf still held a glimmer of hope, thinking that Lu Xu might just be flying by from afar and hadn't noticed him. As before, he quickly concealed himself, using a Qi Concealment Talisman to hide his aura, waiting for Lu Xu to fly over his head and leave the area.

Seeing this, a playful smile appeared on Lu Xu's lips. He had been continuously observing the dwarf with his Spirit Eye Technique; no matter how many Qi Concealment Talismans the other party used, it would be useless. Unless he possessed some form of invisibility.

Quickly reaching the dwarf's position above his head, Lu Xu activated his Azure Radiance Sword and slashed down. A Qi Condensation Layer Three cultivator with no special techniques was naturally no match for Lu Xu. Lu Xu easily dealt with him. He went forward, packed up everything on the dwarf, incinerated his corpse, and then swiftly departed on the Azure Wind Boat.

He sprinted all the way without a moment's rest. Under the Azure Wind Boat's extreme speed, Lu Xu quickly moved away from Green Lake Market City, gradually delving deeper into the hinterlands of the Wei Kingdom. An hour later, Lu Xu felt his spiritual energy was about to run out, so he stopped. He estimated that he should now be five hundred li away from Green Lake Market City. This distance was likely sufficient!

"I've completely left Green Lake Market City behind," Lu Xu thought to himself. He put away the Azure Wind Boat and flew down towards a patch of green mountains below. This was already the mortal world. The spiritual energy in the mountains was outrageously thin, unable to even meet the minimum requirements for cultivators. However, Lu Xu didn't care about the spiritual energy here. He observed his surroundings, found a mountain peak, and after a series of slashes with his Azure Radiance Sword, he carved out a temporary cave abode.

Entering it, he immediately gripped a spirit stone in each hand, beginning to restore his spiritual energy. Only after his spiritual energy was fully recovered did Lu Xu take out all his gains and begin to inventory them.
