Chapter 78: A Shocking Change

As the white light from the transmission array faded, the figure of the Foundation Establishment cultivator surnamed Qian disappeared. Lin Xuan's eyes lit up with a sudden thought.

The other party hadn't used the Spiritual Eye Technique to verify his identity.

Perhaps he could take a risk.

Lin Xuan turned and left, returning half an hour later dressed in the attire of the Fire Spirit Gate. He drank a mouthful of the red silk grass and green liquid, and his Spiritual Energy circulated, activating the Heavenly Demon Imitation Technique. A white mist enveloped his body, and when it dissipated, his appearance had completely changed.

Lin Xuan had prepared thoroughly for his trip to the Creek Leaping Gorge, especially gathering information on the Foundation Establishment experts of the Fire Spirit Gate, which he had memorized and stored in his jade slip.

The new appearance he had taken on was that of an elder surnamed Chen.

"Chen, Senior Uncle," one of the disciples guarding the transmission array greeted.

Lin Xuan nodded, adopting a haughty demeanor.

"Are you here to gather herbs in the Creek Leaping Gorge, Senior Uncle?" another disciple asked.

"Of course," Lin Xuan replied curtly, feigning annoyance.

The disciples didn't dare to suspect him or use the Spiritual Eye Technique to verify his identity, fearing that they might offend this temperamental elder.

Lin Xuan had taken a huge risk, but it paid off. The disciples led him to the transmission array, and as the white light enveloped him, he disappeared.

When Lin Xuan's vision cleared, he found himself in a small clearing surrounded by dense trees. He knew he had to leave immediately and disappeared into the jungle.

About half an hour later, a brilliant white light appeared, radiating intense Spiritual Energy fluctuations. When the light dissipated, nearly a hundred cultivators emerged.

The leaders were imposing Foundation Establishment cultivators, while the others, though only Spiritual Transformation cultivators, were all high-level experts with fifth-layer techniques. They wore robes with embroidered flames, marking them as elite disciples of the Fire Spirit Gate.

"You may proceed according to my previous instructions," an elderly man in a yellow Daoist robe, with a childlike face and crane-like hair, commanded.

"Yes, Sect Master," the disciples replied in unison, bowing respectfully. The elderly man was none other than the Sect Master of the Fire Spirit Gate, Qingling Zhenren.

The disciples dispersed, transforming into beams of light that vanished into the trees. Most of them possessed Spiritual Tools or precious talismans, showcasing their exceptional status.

"Let's proceed, Senior Brothers," Qingling Zhenren said. "Eliminate all cultivators in the Creek Leaping Gorge, except for our own disciples. Leave no one alive."

One of the Foundation Establishment cultivators hesitated, "Sect Master, is this really necessary? The Creek Leaping Gorge is open to neutral cultivators who pay the required crystal stones..."

Qingling Zhenren's expression turned stern. "Have you forgotten the words of our Senior Uncle? The artifact will emerge sooner than expected. To prevent it from falling into others' hands or the news leaking, we must eliminate all cultivators inside. Trust me, once we obtain the artifact, our sect will become the hegemon of the Yan Province. Those who obey will prosper; those who defy will perish. We need not fear retaliation."

The other Foundation Establishment cultivators nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. They transformed into brilliant beams of light and disappeared into the trees.

Qingling Zhenren remained, his mind weighed down by the risks. Though he had presented the plan with confidence, he knew that failure would bring catastrophic consequences. The decision to eliminate all outsiders was not taken lightly, and he was aware that the fate of the Fire Spirit Gate hung in the balance.

After a moment of hesitation, Qingling Zhenren steeled himself and followed his fellow sect members into the trees, determined to see the plan through to its end.
