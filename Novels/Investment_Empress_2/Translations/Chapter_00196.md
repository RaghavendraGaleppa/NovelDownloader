# Chapter 196: Quick, I'm About to Twist My Mouth!

Inside the Sword Tower of Hengyun Sword City.

After generations of Sword City disciples had worked on it, the interior of this sword-shaped mountain peak had been carved out extensively.

The library was located within.

The martial arts left behind by those who had contemplated the Sword Mark over the years were all collected here. The further one went, the fewer martial arts remained; the front shelves were filled mostly with mid-grade techniques.

Following the two Law Body experts, the group walked past the long stone bookshelves.

"So many rewards are still unclaimed. Going back tonight is going to be a big project."

"I like big projects..."

Xiao Li was in a good mood.

He had gained a great deal from the Martial Arts Summit. The Nine Swords of Dugu were becoming familiar, he had condensed a Sword Pill, and more importantly, he had satisfied his desire to be a swordsman without ruining his reputation.

He had also comprehended a hammer technique, and the System's feedback was incredibly bountiful.

There was still a big prize from the Ice Cube that he hadn't opened yet...

"Hiss..."

Li Mo suddenly sucked in a cold breath.

"Brother Li... Wh-what's wrong with you?"

Princess Xiao Jiang panicked.

Ying Bing also snapped out of her thoughts and glanced sideways.

Li Mo's face was full of pain:

"Quick, help me clear my mind, I can't stop myself from wanting to twist my mouth."

Jiang Chulong: "???"

Ying Bing: "....."

The Ice Cube had a solution. She calmly took down the big-headed doll from her waist.

Expressionless, her fair fingers grabbed the big head and twisted it open with a forceful snap.

Little Li calmed down.

Along the way.

The group passed through the areas storing mid-grade, high-grade, and ultimate martial arts.

One by one, the others stayed behind, submitting the martial arts they had领悟ed or prepared to exchange.

Only Li Mo and the two girls.

They followed the two Law Body experts all the way to the depths of the Sword Tower.

This was the area where the Divine Techniques were stored.

The Law Body expert who looked like a young man with white hair turned around, looking at the three of them with a sigh of emotion:

"Since the Sword City was established here, only two people have ever come to this place."

"Are they... the two... seniors?" Princess Xiao Jiang asked innocently.

The white-haired young man: "....."

The old man who looked like an immortal: "......"

Are we not people?

The girl's innocent words were as sharp as her sword.

"Law Body experts possess the abilities of immortals; how can they be judged by ordinary standards?"

Li Mo rubbed Princess Xiao Jiang's head.

Then he cupped his fists towards the two:

"Please continue, seniors. I presume this place holds extraordinary significance?"

The white-haired young man looked at Li Mo with a smile, then said:

"Those two people were, one, a former Xuan Realm master, the Sword Saint of Yunzhou, Senior Wan Ze."

"The other was the person who left the original Sword Mark."

Li Mo was stunned.

Wasn't this Sword Mark ancient and timeless?

But then he thought about it—he had become a Sword Immortal for no apparent reason. Given the nature of the Yunzhou martial world, it was best not to believe all the rumors...

"As expected."

Ying Bing's slightly lowered eyes gave a barely perceptible nod.

"You are very smart."

The old man with the crane-like hair and childlike face said with a smile:

"The other person who came here and left the Hengyun Sword Mark on the Strange Stone was Emperor Wu, the Grand Ancestor!"

Little Li's eyes widened.

Does that mean the mark on the Strange Stone was originally written by the First Emperor?

After spreading for thousands of years, it became known as the work of an immortal?

"So what I saw... was Grandpa Ancestor..." Jiang Chulong said, half-understanding.

"Don't worry."

The white-haired young man shook his head and smiled:

"I'm afraid even the Great Yu Imperial Family doesn't know about this anymore. Besides, a strong expert like Emperor Wu had a broad mind. Even if he knew that later outstanding geniuses had modified the Sword Mark, he would probably be pleased..."

He stopped halfway through the sentence, suddenly remembering.

---

Putting himself in the other's shoes, he remembered what kind of thing Li Mo had left behind.

So he changed his tune:

"Rest assured, compared to Emperor Wu, you should worry more about the revenge of the Drizzle Building. They have always been vengeful and hard to guard against."

"They are much closer than the Emperor who has been dead for a thousand years."

Li Mo: "........"

You really know how to comfort people.

"Please."

"You may record the martial arts you just领悟ed for future generations, or leave behind a martial art of similar grade."

The old man took out various items for recording martial arts: jade slips, paper and brush, and mirror walls.

The latter part of the speech was purely procedural.

Under heaven, how many people can obtain a Divine Technique?

Those without the affinity are useless even if they see a Divine Technique.

For example, the Sword Mark left by Emperor Wu on the Strange Stone has been in Hengyun Sword City for thousands of years, yet no one has ever truly possessed it.

Martial arts also choose their masters, and such people are extremely rare.

Jiang Chulong and Ying Bing both chose the mirror wall, a special treasure that can leave one's image within it.

Ying Bing pondered for a moment, and Tian Frost was unsheathed.

It was precisely the mysterious and ethereal, stunning sword from just now.

Seeing this sword technique again, the two Law Body experts were still full of emotion:

"This sword move is like a trace of an immortal. What is its name?"

"Name..."

Ying Bing frowned slightly.

Divine Sky Heart?

No, this sword was vastly different from before. It was created after she gained some insight from Li Mo's Soul Intent.

To give it a fitting name, she didn't know what to call it for a moment...

"Ethereal and immortal-like, how about 'Flying Fairy from Beyond the Heavens'?" Little Li performed steadily.

Art comes from life...

Ying Bing's mind settled.

Suddenly, after hearing the four words 'Flying Fairy from Beyond the Heavens', she felt all other names were hard to listen to.

How did he come up with that?

He always says art comes from life, but where did this come from? Who has ever seen an immortal...

Soon.

Princess Xiao Jiang followed suit and completed her recording.

When it was Li Mo's turn, he looked troubled:

"You two know me, it's not that I want to keep it to myself."

"It's just that this martial art cannot be recorded in writing. Even if I were to demonstrate it, I couldn't do it."

Now, relying on his own strength, he could only complete the last stance of 'The Seven Settling of Heaven and Earth' thanks to his formidable physical body. Otherwise, he could only use the World Seed to support it.

Ying Bing sheathed her sword, her eyes rippling slightly.

He... cannot use that Divine Technique right now?

Doesn't that mean that for the next ranking, the Divine Technique cannot be counted as combat power?

The two Law Body experts exchanged a glance.

Well.

That makes sense. Divine Techniques have different effects. Some are used to temper the body, while others have immense power. Below a certain realm, they simply cannot be施展ed.

That scene of the heavens and earth hanging low made this statement highly credible.

The white-haired young man pondered:

"If you hadn't been premonitory, the Sword City would have suffered a heavy blow. It wouldn't be impossible to make an exception for you..."

"How dare I let a senior break the rules for me? Besides, 'Everyone for me, and I for everyone' is the very purpose of the Martial Arts Summit."

Li Mo smiled shyly.

How could he use up the Sword City's favor so easily.

He still wanted to copy the Strange Stone. If he used the favor now, it would be hard to ask for it later...

"I have three proposals for you to consider."

"The first is quite direct. This junior will offer some财物 to pay for the qualification to comprehend the Strange Stone this time."

The white-robed young man laughed in amazement:

"The Sword City isn't lacking your petty cash. How much can you offer?"

"Just... a little bit."

Little Li extended two fingers, shyly making a gesture.

As is well known, a mustard seed contains a vast universe.

So the distance between the fingers might not be as small as it looks.
