# Chapter 39: The Outpost

After more than a month, Qin Chong finally returned to Pingyang City.

Instead of heading straight back to his family, he found an inn in a remote corner of the city to stay. The next day, he disguised himself slightly before venturing out. He suppressed his cultivation level to the fifth layer of Qi Refining to avoid drawing attention.

After all, he had fled to Qingchuan County to escape pursuit, and he had no idea what had happened at the Cangwu Mine afterward. Qin Chong decided to gather information first. As the capital of Pingyang County, Pingyang City was the perfect place for intelligence gathering.

After several days of investigation, Qin Chong finally pieced together the general situation.

Following the fierce conflict in the mine, both the Canglong Valley and Qingxuan Sect had withdrawn their cultivators but left guards at the entrance to prevent others from entering. The incident had drawn the attention of higher-ups from both factions, who were now negotiating to reallocate the spiritual stone resources of the Cangwu Mine.

Such negotiations were unlikely to reach a swift resolution and would likely drag on. The Canglong Valley had compensated the families of fallen cultivators, while rogue cultivators were left to their own misfortune.

Half a year had passed since the incident, and the Qin family had presumably received compensation from Canglong Valley. However, Qin Chong had no way of knowing the exact amount.

Initially, Qin Chong considered returning to his family, but after some thought, he decided to resolve his current predicament first. As far as the world was concerned, he was a dead man. If he suddenly reappeared, how would Canglong Valley react?

Not only did he possess spiritual stones from the mine, but the sect had also compensated his family. Without a reasonable explanation, the situation would be difficult to resolve. Most importantly, Qin Chong feared this might jeopardize his chance to join Canglong Valley.

After much deliberation, he decided to visit the Canglong Valley outpost in Pingyang City to assess the situation. If he could encounter an acquaintance who could speak on his behalf, he wouldn’t mind paying a price. However, only a Foundation Establishment cultivator would have the influence to help in this matter.

Among the few Foundation Establishment cultivators Qin Chong knew from the Cangwu Mine, only Huo Qiang and Meng Fei had any real connection with him. But he wasn’t sure if they were currently in Pingyang City. After all, attempting to enter Canglong Valley’s outpost directly was unrealistic—with his cultivation level, he likely wouldn’t even make it past the gate.

Over the next few days, Qin Chong lurked near the Canglong Valley outpost, gathering information in secret.

One day, while eavesdropping in a teahouse near the outpost, he overheard two Qi Refining cultivators mention "Uncle Meng," immediately catching his attention. Qin Chong had no idea how many Foundation Establishment cultivators surnamed Meng existed in Canglong Valley, but this was a lead worth pursuing.

"Who would’ve thought Uncle Meng would be overseeing this year’s disciple recruitment?" one of them remarked.

"Indeed. Rumor has it he’s at the peak of mid-Foundation Establishment and was supposed to be in seclusion, preparing to break through to late-stage. Yet the sect leader still sent him here."

"That means this recruitment mission must be significant."

"True. If we perform well, the sect’s rewards will be generous."

"Recruitment duty is always a lucrative assignment."

Both men were at the eighth layer of Qi Refining. Though they weren’t wearing Canglong Valley insignias, their conversation made their affiliation clear.

As the two prepared to leave after settling their bill, Qin Chong quickly approached them.

"Greetings, fellow Daoists. Might you be disciples of Canglong Valley?" Qin Chong clasped his hands in salute with a smile.

The two exchanged wary glances before one replied, "We are. Why have you stopped us?"

"My apologies for the intrusion. I couldn’t help but overhear your mention of 'Uncle Meng.' Might that be Senior Meng Fei of Canglong Valley?"

Their expressions darkened slightly at the mention of eavesdropping but turned curious when Qin Chong named Meng Fei.

After a brief silent exchange, one answered, "You know Senior Meng Fei?"

"We’ve met once. He once saved my life, and I’ve been hoping for a chance to express my gratitude in person."

"Is that so? Uncle Meng is indeed at the outpost today, but whether he’ll see you is another matter."

"Thank you for the information. I’ll take my leave now."

With that, Qin Chong headed straight for the Canglong Valley outpost. The distance was less than a hundred zhang, and he arrived at the gates in moments.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist," Qin Chong saluted the guard at the entrance.

The guard returned the gesture. "You don’t appear to be from Canglong Valley. What brings you here?"

"I am Qin Chong of the Qin family from Mount Xiao. I wish to request an audience with Senior Meng Fei. Could you kindly announce my arrival?"

"Ah, you wish to see Uncle Meng?" The guard hesitated.

Qin Chong discreetly slipped ten low-grade spirit stones into the man’s hand. "I’d be most grateful. Please inform him that Qin Chong has come from the Cangwu Mine. I believe Senior Meng will agree to see me."

The guard accepted the bribe with practiced ease—clearly not his first time. As an outer sect disciple at the sixth layer of Qi Refining, ten spirit stones were roughly equivalent to a month’s stipend.

"Very well, I’ll deliver your message. But I can’t guarantee Uncle Meng will receive you."

"Naturally. If Senior Meng declines, I’ll leave at once."

"Wait here, then."

As the guard disappeared into the inner courtyard, Qin Chong’s heart pounded. His only connection with Meng Fei was a transaction involving a spirit beast pouch. There was no certainty the man would remember him, let alone agree to meet.

Still, this was a rare opportunity. If it failed, he’d have to explore other options—perhaps even returning to his family and asking his father, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, to intervene.

Before long, the guard returned. His expression told Qin Chong the news was favorable.

"Brother Qin, Uncle Meng has agreed to see you. He’s currently in the left reception hall. Wait outside, and he’ll call you in when he’s free."

Qin Chong’s face lit up, and he promptly handed over another ten spirit stones before hurrying into the inner courtyard.

Taking his place outside the hall, Qin Chong stood quietly, waiting. The conversation inside was undoubtedly shielded by isolation spells, rendering it inaudible. Though curiosity gnawed at him, he dared not attempt to eavesdrop.
