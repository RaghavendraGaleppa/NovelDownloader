# Chapter 37: Departure

When Zhou Qing returned to the entrance of the Lin family's old residence, he saw Butcher Hu waiting in the snow, clearly having been there for some time.

"Young Master Zhou," Butcher Hu called out, clutching something in his arms.

Zhou Qing nodded and opened the courtyard gate, allowing them both to enter. They proceeded to the main hall.

"Brother Hu, please have a seat."

Butcher Hu sat down and produced two small porcelain bottles—one old, one new. In a low voice, he said, "Young Master Zhou, the old bottle contains venom freshly extracted from a recently caught poisonous snake. The new one holds juice ground from raw aconite roots. Please be careful with them."

Zhou Qing weighed the bottles in his hand and smiled approvingly. "I know. The *Huichun Fudian* mentions a medicinal recipe requiring snake venom and raw aconite juice, but these ingredients are hard to obtain. I had to trouble you for help."

Catching snakes in winter was no easy task. Even if Zhou Qing had tried himself, he wouldn't have been as effective as Butcher Hu, who was accustomed to rural life.

Butcher Hu quickly clasped his hands in respect. "Young Master Zhou, I owe you my life. If you ask me to climb a mountain of blades or plunge into a sea of fire, I won't hesitate. I handled this matter discreetly—even my wife doesn’t know what I’ve been doing lately."

Zhou Qing nodded, then chatted with Butcher Hu for a while. He examined Butcher Hu's injured leg to check for lingering effects, confirming it had healed well before seeing him out.

After Butcher Hu left, Zhou Qing opened the bottles to inspect the contents before swiftly resealing them. The snake venom was scarce, while the aconite juice was more plentiful.

Raw aconite roots were typically harvested in autumn or winter, but not when it was too cold, as frost could kill them. The fresh juice from these roots was highly toxic—some indigenous hunters coated their arrows and weapons with it before hunts.

Since the aconite juice couldn’t be stored for long, Zhou Qing had asked Butcher Hu to extract it just before the heavy snow, ensuring its potency. Any later, and the aconite might have frozen to death. Snake venom also had a limited shelf life—fresh venom could last up to a month under normal conditions, but its toxicity would gradually diminish beyond that. Drying the venom extended its lifespan but weakened its potency.

With less than a month until the provincial examinations, Zhou Qing calculated that the cold winter weather might preserve the venom and aconite juice for an additional ten to fifteen days. Their toxicity would wane slowly rather than vanish abruptly.

One reason Zhou Qing had purchased the rusted sword—aside from its ancient design and inconspicuous appearance—was its rough surface, which made it ideal for applying poison. Ideally, weapons meant for poisoning should be crafted with specialized techniques to retain sharpness while holding toxins—a closely guarded secret even within imperial circles. 

Zhou Qing was willing to sacrifice some sharpness for the advantage of a poisoned blade. In combat, his strategy relied on surprise rather than direct confrontation. A weapon laced with potent venom could compensate for its lack of edge. Moreover, the swords available in shops were never exceptionally sharp. Truly fine blades were expensive and rarely sold openly. Even with the Lin family’s help, finding a sword that was both sharp and suitable for poisoning would be difficult.

Zhou Qing prioritized immediate, lethal effects. If he compromised on toxicity, he’d have more options—but in life-or-death struggles, potency was paramount. 

He stored the two bottles carefully, planning to coat the rusted sword and crossbow bolts with their contents just before departure to maximize their effectiveness. The larger surface of the sword would receive the more plentiful aconite juice, while the scarce snake venom would be reserved for the arrowheads.

With these preparations complete, Zhou Qing felt more at ease.

Next came refining his *Ghost Step* technique. Fuzhong’s assessment aligned with his own speculation: it required intense mental focus. This reminded Zhou Qing of his first soul projection—an experience that had nearly cost him his health. 

But he was no longer the frail youth he once was. Still, he had no intention of attempting soul projection again until after the examinations. For now, he would only experiment with the pre-projection state.

Back then, he had achieved it by reciting passages from *The Great Learning*, steadily sharpening his concentration.

*"The Way of the Great Learning lies in manifesting virtue, in renewing the people, and in resting in the highest good..."*

As he chanted, his mind grew calmer. The snowstorm ahead seemed no more than a light frost in his heart.

True strength came from inner resilience.

When Zhou Qing felt his spirit condensing and his body growing weightless, he abruptly stood up. This time, he restrained himself from allowing his spirit to fully project, instead maintaining control—a result of his relentless training and mental discipline.

Mastery over oneself was the first step toward confronting the unknown.

The *Ghost Step*, derived from the eight forms of the *Deer Play* and integrated with the *Qingfeng Fudian*, still primarily followed the *Deer Play* style. Ghosts embodied intangible forces—sinister, fearful, and shadowy. 

Sneaking through the night was ghostly; a sudden kick to a vital point was elusive...

Various ghost-related concepts flowed through Zhou Qing’s mind, and the eight forms of *Ghost Step* naturally took shape and meaning in his consciousness: *Sneaky*, *Elusive*, *Sinister Intent*...

He practiced the forms three times before concluding. The *Health Preserver* system rated his *Ghost Step* as "Proficient"—effortlessly achieved, like water flowing downhill.

At the Proficient level, *Ghost Step* could fully merge with the *Qingfeng Fudian*, but his *Literary Core* remained translucent and unreplenished. Previously, his *Tiger-Crane Twin Forms* had only achieved fusion by shattering his *Literary Core*, consuming his vital energy in the process.

But Zhou Qing lacked the time for that now. Without *Vitality Pills*, recovering expended energy would take too long and impair his combat readiness. Moreover, mastering a new technique would require additional effort.

For now, his Proficient-level *Ghost Step* was more than sufficient.

In close combat, he had *Ghost Step*, *Tiger-Crane Twin Forms*, and an unrefined left-handed sword technique. For ranged engagements, he relied on *Flicking Divine Skill* and his crossbow. The crossbow packed more punch but lacked the flexibility of *Flicking Divine Skill*, which compensated with agility but less power.

The hand crossbow gifted by Miss Lin was compact and portable. Military-grade crossbows were more powerful but far less convenient. The hand crossbow’s lethal range was about thirty paces—beyond that, only precise hits to vital areas like the heart or throat could be fatal. Even then, warriors like Monk or Chen Bao could survive such wounds.

Hence, Zhou Qing had poisoned the arrowheads.

In the following days, Zhou Qing honed his martial skills, reviewed examination essays, and brushed up on policy discussions. The provincial exams included policy questions, and given the turbulent times, some examiners might emphasize contemporary issues—a trend seen in past dynasties.

His mentor had once noted that land annexation wasn’t always forced—sometimes peasants willingly sold their land. As smallholders, they were vulnerable to disasters. Selling during good years was preferable to losing everything in bad ones. Additionally, growing urban opportunities in commerce and crafts provided alternatives to farming.

A landowner’s reputation also influenced annexation. In Hu Village, for instance, the villagers would gladly pledge their land to Zhou Qing if he became a provincial graduate—not just for his status, but because they trusted him from his teaching days. 

Conversely, unscrupulous gentry had to resort to coercion, earning them infamy. Established families often maintained good reputations locally while exploiting outsiders—a delicate balance of power.

From nations to villages, governance followed similar principles: without support, nothing succeeded. 

Passing the provincial exams was arduous, but sabotaging a candidate was easy. Miss Lin’s research revealed that Jiangzhou had produced no provincial graduates in the last three examinations—likely because promising candidates had mysteriously fallen ill or encountered "accidents." 

With no new graduates and old ones passing away or relocating, the Zhang family had risen as Jiangzhou’s dominant power. Those who benefited were the prime suspects.

Given his history with the Zhangs, Zhou Qing was certain his journey to Changzhou wouldn’t be smooth. But he was prepared.

At the Lin family’s outer estate, Zhou Qing and Fuzhong regrouped with their escort—a group of seventeen guards from the Weiyuan Escort Agency, led by a stocky martial artist with thick fingers.

"Master Zhou, this is Chief Wu of Weiyuan Escort. They’re passing through Jiangzhou en route to Changzhou. Chief Wu, known as ‘Tiger Claw,’ is highly reputable. His father was also a close friend of my grandfather."

Miss Lin turned to Chief Wu. "Please take good care of Master Zhou on this journey."

Zhou Qing had been briefed beforehand. After exchanging pleasantries, Chief Wu—whose given name was Feng—exuded a sharp, disciplined aura. Though courteous to the fifteen-year-old scholar, his demeanor shifted when Fuzhong introduced himself, revealing newfound respect.

After final preparations, Chief Wu outlined escort protocols. Zhou Qing and Fuzhong joined the convoy as it departed the city.

Outside the gates, the escort banner unfurled. Miss Lin had provided Zhou Qing with the gentlest horse available, and after days of practice, he could manage the journey—though he was no cavalryman. Mountainous terrain limited horseback advantages anyway.

"Master Zhou, rest assured," Chief Wu assured him. "We’ve negotiated safe passage with prominent outlaws. The martial world operates on face and favors—what we call *human sentiment*. And with Master Fuzhong’s reputation… why, back in Qingfu Temple’s heyday—"

Zhou Qing hadn’t expected Chief Wu to be so talkative—though the man clearly tailored his chatter to his audience.

Fuzhong coughed lightly. "Chief Wu, Qingfu Temple is but a shadow of its former self. That any in the martial world still remember us is grace enough. There’s no need to dwell on past glories."

Chief Wu fell silent. Though Qingfu Temple had declined, a "Fu"-generation Daoist like Fuzhong surely had formidable skills. His presence bolstered the convoy’s safety—unless they encountered bandits or supernatural threats.

For three days, the journey was uneventful. The guards remarked on their unusual luck, given recent rumors of increased banditry.

On the tenth evening, with only three barren hills separating them from Changzhou, they stopped at a lone roadside inn to rest.
