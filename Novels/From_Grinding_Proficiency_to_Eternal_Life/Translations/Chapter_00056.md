# Chapter 56: The News

A quarter of an hour later, Xu Yunfan’s slightly closed eyes snapped open. He took a step, his footfall completely silent, and quickly moved away.

*You carefully concealed your presence, lying low and waiting for the perfect moment. Your opponent remained completely unaware. Your Hunting Proficiency has increased.*

Glancing at the system prompt that floated into his vision, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let a hint of a smile appear on his face.

As the morning mist drifted through the dead woods, Xu Yunfan was using plant ash to bury the last of the embers.

His ears twitched slightly. He took a large stride and stood atop a small, gently sloping hill within the woods. Uncle Jin’s caravan had already left the dead woods and was slowly making its way along the winding official road. Twelve carriages appeared and disappeared within the thin fog.

Once he was certain there were no issues, Xu Yunfan withdrew his gaze.

After a quick disguise, he wrapped himself in a prepared coarse hemp cloak and squeezed into the line entering the city. Hanging some mountain goods he had traded for from a hunter at his waist, he entered North Ye City as if he were an ordinary person.

As soon as he entered the city, Xu Yunfan quickly returned to the Clear River Residence. He hastily threw together a pot of mixed ingredients to fill his stomach, then looked at the haphazardly scattered pots, bowls, and pans.

*Perhaps I should hire a cook.*

With this thought in mind, he turned and walked out of the kitchen, heading to his study. He unfolded the iron bridge and fortress bone-forging essentials recorded on the silk cloth he had been carrying and began to study it carefully.

*You have studied the Iron Bridge Fortress Bone-Forging Chapter in detail. You feel as if you have gained some insight, but upon closer contemplation, you cannot grasp it.*

*You have repeatedly studied the Iron Bridge Fortress Bone-Forging Chapter. You feel a layer of paper is about to be pierced, but every time you reach a critical moment, you are inexplicably blocked by an obstacle.*

*As you delve deeper into the Iron Bridge Fortress Bone-Forging Chapter, the vital energy and blood within your body seem to stir slightly, but it is difficult to discern the pattern.*

*...*

The morning passed, and Xu Yunfan was beginning to feel dizzy. The writing on the silk was obscure and difficult to understand, and there were many hidden metaphors and key points. If not for the Attribute Panel, he would have been left staring blankly, unable to practice.

By the time the sun was high in the sky, Xu Yunfan rubbed his sore and aching eyes.

The characters on the silk cloth seemed to come alive, wandering before his eyes. Those discourses on "energy penetrating the hundred bones" and "bones like fine iron" appeared simple on the surface, yet they concealed profound mysteries.

Finally, Xu Yunfan shook his head, and the lively fonts immediately calmed down.

It turned out he was just seeing things from staring too hard.

He couldn't help but gently roll up the silk cloth in his hand. The silk surface with its hidden gold patterns reflected a cold light under the slanting sun.

Xu Yunfan stared at the deepening twilight outside the window, his thoughts surging like a tide.

The Qingzhou Iron Clothes Gate massacre was still an unsolved case on the surface. The various sects fought over the scattered fragments of secret manuals, yet they had never heard of anyone who had truly mastered the sect-defining supreme art.

Although he had heard from street gossip that it was the work of three famous sects in Qingzhou joining forces, most of it was speculation, and few knew the actual details.

The fragments of the Iron Bridge Fortress Bone-Forging technique circulating in the marketplace seemed more like bait to lure people into a trap.

The Iron Clothes Gate was destroyed, and it was likely that several families possessed related secret manuals. Although he had heard of the Iron Clothes Gate's name at the Long Wind Tavern, he had never heard of any family mastering the Iron Bridge Fortress technique and walking the Jianghu with it.

In this day and age, if one wants to practice martial arts, having a martial arts manual is not enough; it also involves many hidden key points and techniques.

If an ordinary person were to get their hands on one, without guidance from a master, and practiced recklessly, they would easily cripple themselves.

He might as well just pick up the Pot-gold Hammer and go to the courtyard to practice the Red Lasso Cloak Hammer.

*Clang!!*

The crisp sound of the Pot-gold Hammer striking the blue stone ground startled the birds roosting under the eaves. Xu Yunfan’s arm muscles bulged. The two-hundred-and-twenty-pound Pot-gold Hammer felt as light as nothing in his hand.

As he executed the opening stance of the Red Lasso Cloak Hammer, the courtyard stirred without any wind. The withered yellow leaves on the ground, along with the snowflakes, formed a vortex in the wake of the hammer's wind.

After reaching great mastery in the Skin and Muscle Refinement, he found that the efficiency of increasing the proficiency of the Red Lasso Copper Body Cloak Hammer technique had become much faster. Combined with the mental resilience granted by the Lin Character Mantra, which made his mind clearer and his thoughts sharper, his reactions had also become a bit faster.

He practiced until he was completely exhausted before finally putting down the Pot-gold Hammer, covering it with a black cloth, and slinging it over his back. He left the residence and headed straight for the Long Wind Tavern.

As soon as he entered the tavern, a deliberately gruff voice rang out by Xu Yunfan’s ear.

"Brother Xu! I haven't seen you for several days. I didn't expect to run into you here. Come on, come on, you have to let me treat you today!"

Xu Yunfan turned toward the sound and saw Su Shiyu poking half her face out from over a wall. Her moon-white brocade robe was stained with some dirt, and her hair crown hung askew on her temple, looking exactly like a civet cat that had sneaked out of a manor.

Su Shiyu, the young master—or rather, young lady—of the Su family in North Ye City. This person yearned for the Jianghu and had a bold and generous personality. She often dressed as a man and feasted Jianghu guests at the Long Wind Tavern. From the looks of it, she truly had a wide circle of friends.

In a month, she probably spent half her time befriending Jianghu guests. Whether they were wandering swordsmen or genuine Jianghu heroes, she accepted them all without refusal.

It was said that her family also supported quite a few Jianghu retainers.

But according to Xu Yunfan’s understanding, most of these Jianghu retainers were just for show.

It was rare for Xu Yunfan to be someone who looked like a master at a glance, so Su Shiyu naturally wouldn't let him slip by.

As for her disguise as a man,恐怕 only she herself didn't realize it, thinking it was flawless.

But she was still an interesting person. She associated with others without any ulterior motives, simply for the sake of friendship. Xu Yunfan was quite willing to befriend such a person.

In a private room on the second floor of the Long Wind Tavern, a golden crane-beaked incense burner emitted curling wisps of green smoke.

"This is apricot blossom white wine that has been cellar-stored for twenty years. Brother Xu, you must have a good taste today. I specially brought this out from my home. It's most suitable to drink in winter."

Su Shiyu broke the clay seal, pouring the amber-colored liquid into a white jade cup. As her sleeve slid down, a section of her lotus-white arm was revealed, and Xu Yunfan’s eyes darted over it.

"Brother Xu, do you know about the matter thirty miles west of the city last night?"

She lowered her voice, feigning mystery, unable to hide the excitement on her face.

Xu Yunfan’s hand, which had been stroking the rim of the cup, paused slightly. The amber-colored wine in the white jade cup rippled with tiny waves.

He looked up at Su Shiyu. The excited light dancing in her eyes reminded him of the life-and-death struggle in the snowy woods last night, swinging his hammer.

He hadn't thought much of it at the time, but now, thinking back, he felt as if he had been exceptionally brave.

"Thirty miles west of the city?"

He took a deliberate sip of the wine, the mellow apricot fragrance blooming on the tip of his tongue.

Su Shiyu, completely unaware of his inner turmoil, leaned in closer and lowered her voice.

"I heard that last night, a master was fighting in the snowy woods outside the black market in the west of the city. The trees within a radius of several dozen zhang were all broken, and a boulder taller than a person was smashed into tiny pieces!"

That was a bit of an exaggeration.

Although he had indeed broken many trees while swinging the Pot-gold Hammer, for all the trees within a radius of several dozen zhang to be broken...

He wasn't a professional woodcutter, going around specifically to hack at trees.

As for being shattered into small stones, it was just a sleeping-ox-sized rock that he had smashed to pieces.

It was a classic case of a rumor growing with each telling.
