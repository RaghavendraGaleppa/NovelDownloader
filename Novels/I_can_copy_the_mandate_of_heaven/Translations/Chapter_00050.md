## Chapter 50: The Abandoned Cultivator

The indolent Jin Guang Shangren lounged on his bed, one hand casually kneading a woman in his embrace. She trembled and sobbed, pulling the blanket over herself in an attempt to cover her nearly naked body.

"Su Zongguang, what is it?" Jin Guang Shangren's tone was lazy, his eyes not even bothering to lift, exuding an air of superiority and disdain typical of a cultivator looking down on a mortal, even one who was the leader of the Hai Sha gang.

Despite the years of benefiting from Su Zongguang's offerings—his food, drink, and lodging—it seemed natural to him, as if it were a given that mortals should cater to his needs.

The interruption of his evening's pleasure by Su Zongguang brought a hint of impatience to his voice. "Reply, Up-Sage," Su Zongguang said with a flattering smile, bowing and nodding repeatedly. "The matter with the Qi Xuan gate requires a few more years of preparation. I humbly request Your Excellency to exercise patience."

Su Zongguang explained that the Hai Sha gang had suffered significant losses in their previous conflicts with the Qi Xuan gate and still needed time to recover and recruit more followers from the streets.

"Unlike the Qi Xuan gate, which can cultivate its own martial artists, we cannot," Su Zongguang continued, his words laced with subservience. "Moreover, dismantling such a large entity as the Qi Xuan gate quietly requires coordination with the court. Your identity, Up-Sage, makes it all the more imperative to proceed with caution."

Jin Guang Shangren's expression turned stern at the mention of a delay. What, several more years? 

As a discarded cultivator, blending into the mortal world was difficult. Despite possessing remarkable abilities, he had to restrain himself; otherwise, he risked being discovered by those above.

"How much longer, exactly?" Jin Guang Shangren asked, a thread of impatience in his voice.

"Two to three years, at most," Su Zongguang replied, bowing deeply. "By then, we will have completed all necessary arrangements. Your Excellency can then freely operate in the Qi Xuan gate's territory, like a hegemon of the mountains, wouldn't that be delightful?"

Moreover, Su Zongguang promised to conceal Jin Guang Shangren's identity, ensuring that higher authorities would not trace him.

Upon hearing this, Jin Guang Shangren nodded slowly, a look of relief and satisfaction crossing his face. Life as a discarded cultivator in the mortal world wasn't easy, with numerous restrictions. 

Su Zongguang, still bowing, promised to continuously provide Jin Guang Shangren with beautiful women. "Anything Your Excellency desires, just mention it," he said.

Jin Guang Shangren's expression turned satisfied as he looked at Su Zongguang's subservient demeanor. The power dynamic was intoxicating, momentarily making him forget his own status as a minor figure in the Black Stone Gate.

"That new concubine of yours, the one named Pu Qin, is quite captivating," Jin Guang Shangren said nonchalantly, still kneading the woman in his embrace.

Su Zongguang's smile grew even wider. "For her to serve Up-Sage is a blessing from a past life," he said.

Su Zongguang backed out of the room and closed the door. Once outside, his demeanor changed; his back straightened, and a sinister look slowly crept onto his face.

The "concubine" was merely bait, a courtesan bought from a brothel for 300 taels of silver. 

But years of observation had shattered Su Zongguang's illusions about cultivators. He recalled his first meeting with Jin Guang Shangren, where the latter effortlessly killed one of Su's top martial artists with a flying sword.

At that time, Su Zongguang revered Jin Guang Shangren like a deity. 

"Such a wretched being can also cultivate? What does that make me? Am I not a thousand times stronger?" Su Zongguang muttered to himself, a dark curse escaping his lips.

Yet, he immediately regained his impassive expression and walked away, lost in thought.

Even a small character like him could plot against these 'big shots.' 

"You are too naive," he seemed to whisper to himself.

The game was far from over.
