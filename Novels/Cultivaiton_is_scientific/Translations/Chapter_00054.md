# Chapter 54: Inventory Check  

Li Shiming retraced his steps carefully, using the drone in the sky to avoid pedestrians. Most residents of Zhongdu had just woken up, so the streets were sparsely populated. He chose a secluded route and arrived home by 7 a.m.  

"Young master, when did you get up?" He hadn’t alerted the guards, but as he entered the main house, he was met with Siqin’s bright eyes.  

It made sense—she was already up, preparing his washing supplies.  

"I woke up early today and took a walk in the courtyard," Li Shiming replied casually, having changed into his usual clothes after entering the city.  

Siqin didn’t think much of it and hurried off to finish her tasks.  

Feeling her cheerful energy, the lingering effects of the previous night’s killings faded away, and a smile crept onto his face.  

After washing up, he headed to the study.  

Everyone in the household knew he was preparing for the imperial exams, so they kept quiet and stayed away from the study to give him the best possible environment for studying.  

Li Shiming placed three storage pouches in front of him. Looking at them, he knew the Hao family’s troubles were finally over.  

He hadn’t wanted it to come to this, but with the Hao family constantly threatening him, there had been no other choice. The moment they sent assassins after him, it had become a fight to the death.  

Two of the storage pouches were of the same model, while the third was slightly different.  

He opened the first of the identical pouches. Just like the one he had obtained from the previous Hao family cultivator, it contained a low-grade flying sword, over a hundred spirit stones, and dozens of various talismans.  

Slightly disappointed, he opened the second identical pouch. This one held an additional talisman brush and some ink, suggesting its owner had been a talisman maker.  

His attention then turned to the final pouch—the one he had the highest hopes for.  

This pouch had belonged to the Hao family’s elder, a cultivator at the sixth level of Qi Refinement and the clan leader.  

As expected, when he channeled spiritual energy into it, he immediately noticed the difference.  

Previous storage pouches he’d acquired had only one cubic meter of space, but this one had five.  

Inside, more than half of the space was filled with various items.  

A mid-grade flying sword and a mid-grade shield—clearly the elder’s personal weapons. Mid-grade artifacts were exceedingly rare among rogue cultivators.  

Five porcelain bottles, each containing ten pills. Unfortunately, Li Shiming still didn’t know their effects.  

Five large wooden crates, each filled with stacks of talisman paper—a hundred stacks per crate, totaling five hundred stacks.  

The Hao family had been in the talisman paper business, so this was likely their entire stockpile.  

Ten cloth bags, commonly used by rogue cultivators to store spirit stones. Sure enough, each contained a hundred stones, adding up to a thousand in total.  

Five jade boxes, inside which were spirit herbs emitting faint spiritual energy.  

The jade boxes were inscribed with special runes to preserve the herbs’ potency.  

This was Li Shiming’s first encounter with spirit herbs. He only knew they were used for alchemy but had no further knowledge.  

Lastly, there were books. Alongside the spells he had already learned, he found manuals for *Fireball Technique*, *Healing Technique*, *Vanishing Technique*, *Earth Armor Technique*, and *Ice Arrow Technique*.  

He casually flipped through *Fireball Technique*. It contained detailed instructions on casting the spell, along with descriptions of its essence.  

However, the explanation of the spell’s essence was far more cryptic than he had expected—filled with abstract and esoteric language.  

Li Shiming had no idea how other cultivators understood this, but to him, it was utterly baffling.  

He didn’t understand why something that could be explained simply had to be made so convoluted, making spell-learning unnecessarily difficult.  

In truth, he still didn’t fully grasp this world’s ways. For cultivators, comprehending the essence of spells was an abstract and elusive process. Those who understood it naturally infused their explanations with personal interpretations and emotions.  

Over generations, this had become the standard in the cultivation world.  

Li Shiming was an exception. When he first learned spells, the manuals he used had no descriptions of essence. His understanding came entirely from IBMz15’s simulations, allowing him to experience the essence through his senses.  

Even if he tried to describe the essence in plain language, other cultivators wouldn’t grasp it the way he did—unless he could somehow transmit IBMz15’s simulations directly into their senses.  

Setting aside the spell manuals, he picked up another book: *Evergreen Art*.  

This was a Qi Refinement cultivation method for wood-attribute spiritual roots.  

After reading it, he compared it to his own *Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique* and felt *Evergreen Art* was far simpler.  

Of course, this was just his impression. Given his limited knowledge, he couldn’t be sure if his assessment was accurate.  

The last book was *Hao Family Talisman Legacy*, detailing their talisman-making heritage.  

After reading it, he finally understood what the bamboo roots were.  

They came from *Talisman Spirit Bamboo*, a spiritual plant central to the Hao family’s legacy.  

Aside from its shoots being edible, the bamboo itself had little practical use. However, its leaves were naturally suited for making talisman paper.  

The *Hao Family Talisman Legacy* contained their unique method of processing the leaves—two leaves could produce one sheet of talisman paper.  

With *Talisman Spirit Bamboo*, the Hao family could both sell talisman paper and train their own talisman makers.  

The book also revealed more about talisman-making than his previous *Rune Encyclopedia* and the Hao cultivator’s notes. He now understood how the assassin had turned invisible.  

There were two methods: either mastering the *Vanishing Technique* to become invisible to mortals, or using talismans imbued with the technique.  

He transferred his commonly used items into the five-cubic-meter storage pouch and hung it at his waist—this would be his main pouch from now on.  

Since he could store it in his server room space at any time—or even secretly swap it out—he didn’t have to worry about others noticing that a mere second-level Qi Refinement cultivator possessed such a valuable item.  

The remaining six pouches were stored in the server room for additional storage.  

His haul also included the *Talisman Spirit Bamboo* and the spiritual soil used to cultivate it—over a cubic meter of soil, taking up one and a half pouches by itself.
