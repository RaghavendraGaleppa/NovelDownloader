# Chapter 64: Layer Nine of Qi Condensation

For Wen Siming, if he were to give up on Foundation Establishment and live a leisurely life, then the struggles of his entire first half of life would have been meaningless. He had sacrificed so much, missed so much, only to ultimately miss out on Foundation Establishment. How could he accept such a result? Thus, he ultimately chose a life-or-death gamble.

Over the past few decades, he had gambled his life many times, so he wasn't afraid to do it again. It wasn't unheard of in history for people to successfully establish their foundation on their own. With such precedents, he believed he could succeed too. Holding onto this belief, three months ago, Wen Siming entered a secluded cultivation chamber specifically prepared by Myriad Immortals City. The chamber was protected by a powerful formation, capable of isolating all external influences. At the same time, the spiritual energy inside was equivalent to a second-tier spirit vein, making it the most suitable place for breaking through to Foundation Establishment. Historically, rogue cultivators in Myriad Immortals City would choose to rent a secluded cultivation chamber when attempting to break through to Foundation Establishment.

At this moment, many people had gathered outside Wen Siming's secluded chamber. Everyone was waiting to see if another Foundation Establishment cultivator would emerge from here. If he succeeded, it would undoubtedly be a huge encouragement to the tens of thousands of rogue cultivators in Myriad Immortals City.

The armored guards of the Merchant Alliance stationed here were already accustomed to this sight. Almost every time a rogue cultivator entered a secluded chamber, a crowd would gather to watch after three months. Everyone wanted to witness a miracle, and everyone wanted to befriend a Foundation Establishment cultivator in advance. Even the Merchant Alliance guards here were no exception; if someone truly succeeded in Foundation Establishment, they would rush forward immediately to express the Alliance's goodwill and invite the person to join as an esteemed guest.

However, after being stationed here for so many years, the guards mostly witnessed failures; successful cases were rare.

Master Wang and Lu Xu also arrived here.

"Three months have passed," Master Wang said, looking towards the secluded chamber. "If he succeeded, he should emerge within these two days!"

"Even if he needs to consolidate, it won't take too long. It'll be either today or tomorrow; we'll know the result soon!" Lu Xu nodded.

"I hope Fellow Daoist Wen succeeds," Master Wang sighed.

The two fell silent, waiting quietly like the surrounding crowd. Time passed by minute by minute. An hour later, suddenly, at the secluded chamber, the large bronze bell at the entrance of the stone room Wen Siming entered abruptly rang out.

"Dong! Dong!"

The resonant bell tolls echoed in everyone's ears. Everyone immediately became fully attentive, carefully counting the number of times the bell rang. Everyone knew the outcome would be revealed momentarily!

"Dong! Dong!"

The resonant bell rang seventeen times consecutively before abruptly stopping.

"Seventeen chimes!"

"He failed!"

"Alas, he still failed in the end. I had held a sliver of hope for Fellow Daoist Wen!"

"Another pile of dry bones on the path to Foundation Establishment!"

Regret, relief, schadenfreude... A cacophony of voices filled the air, people wore various expressions on their faces, and the crowd dispersed with a rumble. Seventeen bell chimes signified failure in Foundation Establishment. After the formation of the secluded chamber sensed the internal qi fluctuations, it would automatically ring the bell to notify those outside.

"Fellow Daoist Wen, I'm afraid he's already..." An old man next to Lu Xu shook his head and sighed before leaving.

Master Wang's face was etched with deep sorrow as he murmured, "Did he truly fail in the end?"

The Merchant Alliance guards stepped forward and opened the stone chamber. People saw that the secluded chamber was already covered in blood. The guard dragged out the corpse. Wen Siming's eyes were wide open, staring straight at the sky, filled with unwillingness.

"There's still a faint breath, but he won't live much longer. Who here is his relative? He might have a dying wish to leave!" The Merchant Alliance guard said, turning to the crowd after a quick check.

A sudden silence fell all around. After a moment, Master Wang stepped forward and said, "He has no family, but this old man is somewhat familiar with him, so I shall arrange his funeral."

The Merchant Alliance guard nodded upon hearing this: "You may arrange the funeral, but according to the rules, his inheritance will be taken by the Merchant Alliance. Do you have any objections?"

Master Wang naturally had no objections; he was arranging Wen Siming's funeral not for his inheritance.

Lu Xu looked at the blood-soaked body, its lips slightly trembling, and felt a chill run down his spine. Failure in Foundation Establishment led to such an end.

"I must obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill!" He secretly vowed in his heart.

Master Wang had already leaned in to listen to Wen Siming's dying words. Seeing this scene, Lu Xu's heart suddenly stirred. He silently recited:

"Check Foundation Establishment experience!"

After a flash of green light, a line of text appeared before his eyes:

[Foundation Establishment Experience: 341]

"Copy!"

Without hesitation, Lu Xu activated his copying ability, replicating Wen Siming's experience.

Failed experiences are sometimes more valuable than successful ones, because many people succeed haphazardly, with a large element of luck involved. Upon receiving Wen Siming's Foundation Establishment experience, Lu Xu immediately understood his entire process of attempting Foundation Establishment. Which steps he took correctly, which he took incorrectly, where problems arose that led to failure, and so on. It was as if he had personally attempted self-Foundation Establishment and failed. Pondering these experiences, Lu Xu immediately felt he had gained much.

"In the future, I must find a way to visit more Foundation Establishment cultivators and copy their successful experiences."

"I also need to keep an eye on this place; whenever a cultivator attempts Foundation Establishment, I'll come to observe. Whether they succeed or fail, their experiences are of immense value to me!"

Lu Xu stared at Wen Siming's corpse for a moment before turning to leave. He was not far from meeting the most basic conditions for Foundation Establishment.

Time flowed slowly, and Lu Xu lived his life as usual. Two more years passed after Wen Siming's failure to establish his foundation. On this day, Lu Xu, who was sitting cross-legged in his cultivation chamber, suddenly opened his eyes, and a powerful aura erupted from his body.

He had entered the Ninth Layer of Qi Condensation!

Looking at the jade bottles scattered across the floor, Lu Xu's expression was calm and unruffled. Breaking through to this final realm of late-stage Qi Condensation did not fill him with much joy. This was something he had long anticipated. His cultivation had advanced another step, but the Heavenly Gate of Foundation Establishment still loomed high above, pressing down before him. He still had no guarantee of breaking through it.

"A Foundation Establishment Pill!" Lu Xu sighed in his heart. In any major force, his cultivation speed would be enough to earn the sect's full cultivation, and being granted a Foundation Establishment Pill would be no problem at all. But as a rogue cultivator, there was no other way; he could only strive on his own.

"I still have twenty to thirty years. I hope it's enough time!"

A few days later, Master Wang from next door came to visit Lu Xu.

"Oh, Brother Han, you've reached the Ninth Layer of Qi Condensation so quickly?" Master Wang was surprised by Lu Xu's rapid cultivation progress. It seemed only six years had passed since he entered the Eighth Layer of Qi Condensation. How could it be so fast? Could this young man possess a High-Grade Spirit Root? A wave of doubts surged in Master Wang's heart.

"Haha, my family saw that I have quite a bit of talent, so they increased their cultivation efforts. I bought a few more bottles of Qi Gathering Pills!" Lu Xu said with a laugh.

"I see, your Han family is quite formidable indeed!" Master Wang exclaimed upon hearing this. With envy in his eyes, he said, "I heard your Yifang Zhai can sell over two thousand spirit stones worth of goods in a year. Your family's talismans and alchemists truly have superb skill!"

"Oh, no, no, it's nothing special, incomparable to the experts in Myriad Immortals City!" Lu Xu shook his head modestly.

The identity "Han Feiyu" he used was described by him as a disciple of a cultivation family from Wei State, stationed in Myriad Immortals City as the family's representative. As such matters were quite common in Myriad Immortals City, the few neighbors who knew about it didn't suspect anything. No one was idle enough to investigate whether such a Han family existed in Wei State. After all, while there were only a few Foundation Establishment families in Wei State, Qi Condensation families were truly countless.

"Brother Wang, what brings you to me today?"

"It's like this: Fellow Daoist Hu, who lives in Building 77, will be celebrating his hundredth birthday in two days. Brother Han, are you interested in attending?"

"Fellow Daoist Hu, is he the one rumored to have opened a secret shop?"

"Haha, rumors are just rumors, no one knows if they're true. But befriending this Fellow Daoist certainly won't hurt!" Master Wang said with a smile. "Moreover, I received news that Fellow Daoist Hu will be using this birthday banquet to do something big. If Brother Han is interested in Foundation Establishment, you might want to attend and listen!"

"Is it related to Foundation Establishment?" Lu Xu's eyes immediately lit up upon hearing this.

"Alright, since it's Fellow Daoist Hu's grand birthday, I'll definitely go in two days!"

Two days later, Lu Xu and Master Wang took small gifts and headed to Fellow Daoist Hu's residence. This Perfected Qi Condensation cultivator truly had extensive connections; dozens of people gathered bustlingly before his gate to offer birthday felicitations. After Lu Xu and Master Wang stepped through the main gate, they unexpectedly saw a familiar figure in Fellow Daoist Hu's courtyard.

Mo Qingchan!
