# Chapter 712: Reforging

“Eight Scenery Cloud Satchel, Creation's Profound Art, Condense Form, Shape the Body!”

Xu Yunfan’s hands formed complex and mysterious seals. Within his Dantian, the Divine Thunder Golden Core spun rapidly. His spiritual power surged instantly, and simultaneously, his personal Heaven and Earth began to continuously erupt with true force, replenishing the rapidly depleting spiritual power.

随之, a magnificent Eight Scenery Cloud Qi erupted from his entire body, wrapping around the small mountain of core spiritual materials before him like a living thing.

“Rumble!”

Purple-gold Divine Thunder descended from the void. Under Xu Yunfan’s microscopic control, the destructive power within transformed into millions of invisible forging hammers. Carrying the power of creation from the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, they hammered down upon the spiritual materials.

The Ten Thousand Year Sword Marrow Jade emitted a clear, resonant sword cry amidst the thunderous forging. Impurities were refined into green smoke and dissipated, eventually transforming into a skeletal outline that was as transparent as glass yet emitted a sharp, metallic aura.

At its spine, nine sword nodes formed naturally, faintly radiating a heart-palpitating sharpness. This was the foundation of the core secret transmission of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect: the "Nine Revolutions Sword Acupoint."

Xu Yunfan had meticulously cultivated the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Art, and possessed the sword path insights of his clone, Han Shi. He was naturally intimately familiar with this.

Immediately after, the North Sea Cold Iron melted amidst the intertwining of thunder and fire. Like silvery mercury, it flowed and wrapped around the glass sword bone, quickly shaping strong tendons and flesh.

With every rare heavenly treasure integrated thereafter, the sharpness of this vessel increased. As time passed, a sword intent containing anger, like a storm about to rise, began to孕育 and flow within it.

“True Spirit, return to its place!”

Xu Yunfan pointed his fingers like a sword and tapped the void.

The Star Spirit Banner flared with dark light. The dark gold Han Shi True Spirit was forcibly pulled from within the banner’s space.

“Xu Yunfan! What are you trying to do?! Don’t you dare control my soul again!”

Han Shi’s True Spirit let out an angry roar. The dark gold sword light struggled violently, trying to break free from its restraints.

However, under the absolute suppression of Xu Yunfan’s Golden Core realm spiritual sense, his resistance was like a蚍蜉 (ant) shaking a tree—utterly useless.

Regarding the curses of his clone, Han Shi, Xu Yunfan’s eyelids did not even twitch. In fact, he wanted the other party’s anger to deepen even more, so that the power of the Anger-Killing Sword Intent would be stronger.

“Right now, you have no choice.”

Lightning flashed intensely in Xu Yunfan’s eyes. The Divine Thunder Golden Core erupted with vast thunder light. Ninety-nine purple-gold dragon shadows roared out, entwining the newly formed sword body.

“Divine Thunder as the guide, Blazing Sun as the furnace, Eight Scenery for forging!”

The thunder dragons wrapped around the sword body tightened suddenly. A trace of the Blazing Sun Dao Fruit’s power was drawn by Xu Yunfan, transforming into a shadow of a furnace that melts gold and burns with烈火 (scorching fire), enveloping the sword body and the struggling Han Shi True Spirit together.

Thunder and fire intertwined, performing the final melting and forced fusion.

This was the most overbearing step: using absolute force to imprint the true spirit into the new body.

The clone, Wukong, was a natural Saint Spirit, so it naturally fit the stone embryo refined by Xu Yunfan from heavenly treasures. But Han Shi was different; without the tempering of thunder and fire, it would be difficult to form his shape.

“Ah!!”

Han Shi’s True Spirit let out a piercing shriek. But under the pressure of the thunder-fire origin and Xu Yunfan’s mighty will, his resistance was dismantled inch by inch. Finally, he was completely pressed into the center of the eyebrows of that glass-silver sword body, which contained a sharp edge within.

“Hum!”

The moment the sword body was reforged, a sharp and unmatched sword qi shot into the sky, slicing apart the ripples of the purple-gold thunder light hanging from the palace roof.

The body standing still suddenly opened its eyes.

Deep within the pupils, two clear glints of sword light, like awakened beasts, instantly pierced through the Divine Thunder Dao Charm within the palace, silently plowing deep grooves into the floor tiles made of dark jade.

The new body, carrying Han Shi’s complete memories, will, and surging hatred, slowly lowered its head, looking at its own body that emitted a cold metallic luster and contained unprecedented power.

Innate Sword Bone, North Sea Cold Iron flesh...

This body could be called the innate sword body that sword cultivators dream of. Yet, Xu Yunfan had forcibly refined it using his forging techniques that touched the heavens and combined them with the Cloud Satchel Avatar Art.

If this news were to spread, even other Golden Core True Lords would have to widen their eyes in disbelief.

“Xu! Yun! Fan!”

Han Shi gritted his teeth. Every word seemed to burst out from between his teeth like ice shards, containing deep-seated hatred and humiliation.

He raised his head sharply, his dark gold pupils burning with fury, locking onto the figure on the cloud platform.

“Using my sword soul as fuel to forge a puppet... you deserve to die!”

Without any hesitation, the Thousand Chariots Geng Sea Raging Tide Sword Art was launched fiercely.

This top-tier sword art from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect had long been mastered to perfection by Han Shi. Now,借助 (relying on) this innate sword body to cast it, its power had undergone a qualitative change.

Han Shi pointed his fingers like a sword and slashed forward into the void.

In an instant, layers upon layers of dark golden sword waves, condensed from pure Anger-Killing Sword Intent, emerged out of thin air.

One wave higher than the last, layer upon layer stacked. Each sword wave contained the terrifying power to sever rivers and tear apart mountains.

Wherever the sword waves passed, the solid space within the palace emitted a groaning sound as if unable to bear the burden, and black cracks appeared like those on a mirror.

The might of this strike had already surpassed the limits of the Foundation Establishment perfection, infinitely approaching the threshold of a Golden Core True Lord.

The violent Anger-Killing Sword Intent filled the great hall, as if trying to drag everything into a abyss of furious destruction.

Facing this furious strike, which was enough to make a Great True Lord at Foundation Establishment perfection treat it with serious caution, Xu Yunfan sat on the cloud platform, not even lifting his eyelids.

He simply brushed the sleeve of his right arm, which hung at his side, downward casually.

“Hum.”

A formless, vast will, like the firmament, descended instantly.

There was no earth-shattering explosion, no collision of blinding light.

The moment Xu Yunfan brushed his sleeve, a purple-gold Dao Domain flowing with life-and-death thunder naturally expanded from him as the center, silently covering the core area of the Divine Thunder Hall.

The layers upon layers, violent and unmatched raging tide sword waves, the moment they charged into this purple-gold Dao Domain, were like a violent avalanche rushing into a sea of hot magma.

There was no earth-shattering explosion, no collision of blinding light.

The sharpness of the Anger-Killing Sword Intent, which was enough to tear space apart, and the fury that could burn the eight desolations, upon contacting the Dao Domain, melted and disintegrated like ice and snow under the scorching sun, returning to silence.

Within the Dao Domain, thunder lived and died, and the profound firmament was eternal, carrying the ten thousand methods of heaven and earth.

Han Shi’s seemingly world-destroying sword waves vanished without a trace, failing to even stir a single ripple.

“Urgh... Pfft!”

Having his full-power strike resolved so easily, the backlash of the sword intent made Han Shi’s body tremble violently. His throat felt sweet, and a mouthful of blood containing sharp sword qi sprayed out, scorching small char marks on the dark jade floor.

He stumbled backward, looking up with difficulty, staring fixedly at Xu Yunfan. For the first time, his dark gold pupils were filled with terror.

“Dao Field?! You have already raised a Heaven and Earth, achieving mid-stage Golden Core?!”

Han Shi’s voice carried violent trembling and无法理解 (ununderstandable) horror.

He came from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and deeply understood what a Dao Field signified.
