# Chapter 33: Golden Abacus, The Transaction

“Fellow Daoist, please wait!”

Hearing the call from behind, Yang Ji's brow subtly furrowed. He turned to look at the young man and said indifferently, “Fellow Daoist, is there something you need?”

“Is Fellow Daoist perhaps a Pill Refining Grandmaster?” The young man chuckled, the glint in his eyes giving Yang Ji a strange sense of familiarity, making an odd feeling rise in his heart.

“Why does Fellow Daoist say I am a Pill Refining Grandmaster?” The young man’s tone carried a hint of certainty, which piqued Yang Ji's curiosity.

“If Fellow Daoist isn't a Pill Refining Grandmaster, why would you buy the Demon Essence Pill formula?” The young man chuckled.

“Pill refining is the foremost of all cultivation arts. Which cultivator hasn't attempted it? I bought the Demon Essence Pill formula out of necessity for my cultivation, just to study it. I merely have a superficial understanding of pill refining; to be called a Pill Refining Grandmaster, I would truly be undeserving.” Yang Ji shook his head slightly.

“Fellow Daoist is too modest. Everyone knows the Demon Essence Pill is difficult to refine, yet you've researched it to this extent. You must be at least a Pill Refining Grandmaster, right?” The young man's eyes flickered as he spoke.

“Studying the Demon Essence Pill makes one a Pill Refining Grandmaster? Then if I were studying the Nine Revolutions Golden Pill, would Fellow Daoist call me a Pill Refining Patriarch?” Yang Ji couldn't help but laugh.

“Even if Fellow Daoist isn't a Pill Refining Grandmaster, judging by your eagerness for Bewitching Demon Grass, you must genuinely have some confidence in attempting its refinement. I dare say Fellow Daoist is definitely a peak Pill Refiner.” The young man stated firmly.

Hmm? This person's insight is quite sharp! Yang Ji was rather surprised, but merely smiled and said, “Fellow Daoist, what is your intention in asking so many questions? If you're looking for someone to refine pills, I could introduce you to a peak Pill Refiner.”

“I know quite a few Pill Refiners, and many of them are Pill Refining Grandmasters. However, this time I'm not here to ask for pills, but to make a transaction with Fellow Daoist.” The young man suddenly smiled mysteriously.

“What kind of transaction?” Yang Ji asked, surprised.

“A mutually beneficial transaction. Doesn't Fellow Daoist need Bewitching Demon Grass? I can provide it for you. Since Fellow Daoist is a peak Pill Refiner, how about for every stalk of Bewitching Demon Grass I provide, Fellow Daoist refines a furnace of Demon-Luring Pills for me for free? I'll supply the medicinal ingredients myself.” The young man smiled.

Bewitching Demon Grass? Yang Ji's heart stirred. His eyes subtly shifted as he looked at the young man and asked, “Since Fellow Daoist knows so many Pill Refiners, why choose me?”

“To be honest, it's because you don't put on airs. That's why I chose you. Which of the other Pill Refiners isn't arrogant and conceited? Not to mention their strange temperaments, one has to exhaust all good words, offer money and gifts just to ask them to refine a single pill.” The young man spoke frankly, showing his helplessness.

Uh?

This reason made Yang Ji slightly stunned.

Indeed. Thinking back to when he first saw Huoyuan from the window overlooking the river valley, Huoyuan had that arrogant, smug look. And remembering their first meeting, Huoyuan also stood with hands behind his back, looking smug and condescending.

They were all incredibly arrogant, and these were just peak Pill Refiners. If they were Pill Refining Grandmasters, wouldn't their tails practically reach the sky?

But, something's not right?

Yang Ji glanced sideways at the young man, a silent thought forming in his mind.

Asking others to refine pills requires offering money, gifts, and humble words. Do I look that cheap?

Or do you think you've found my weakness?

A single stalk of Bewitching Demon Grass for you to open a furnace once?

Are you trying to work me like an ox?

Yang Ji couldn't help but sneer inwardly.

As his thoughts turned, he felt a sense of déjà vu regarding the young man's methods.

Yang Ji raised an eyebrow, gave him a glance, and asked, “I haven't yet had the honor of asking Fellow Daoist's name.”

“My name is Jin Suanpan!” The young man beamed.

“Jin Suanpan?” Another Jin? Yang Ji was slightly taken aback and then asked, “Do you know Jin Dafu?”

“Is Fellow Daoist referring to Jin Dafu of the Myriad Treasures Pavilion on South Wind Island?” The young man's expression subtly changed as he confirmed.

“That's him.” Yang Ji nodded.

“Hahahaha!” In an instant, the young man burst into laughter, his face alight with delight. “Jin Dafu is my Thirty-Eighth Uncle! I never expected Fellow Daoist to be friends with my uncle. No wonder I felt such a sense of familiarity the moment I saw you.”

Uh? They really are family?

Yang Ji's scalp tingled, but his heart settled a bit. This family sought wealth, not lives, so they had their own bottom line. It seemed their family motto was such.

Hearing that he was from the Jin family, Yang Ji properly scrutinized him. His appearance indeed bore some resemblance to Jin Dafu, especially the mischievous glint in his eyes, which was practically identical.

“Fellow Daoist, I still don't know your name,” Jin Suanpan said enthusiastically.

“Yang Ji!”

“So it's Fellow Daoist Yang. Today, I'll be treating. How about we go to a restaurant and have a good talk?” Jin Suanpan said with a smile.

Yang Ji pondered for a moment, then nodded.

Bewitching Demon Grass was what he currently needed. If the person in front of him could provide it, then a transaction was certainly negotiable.

So the two walked into a small tavern and found a quiet spot to sit down.

“Do you have Bewitching Demon Grass on you?” Yang Ji looked at Jin Suanpan and asked straightforwardly.

“I currently have three stalks on me. If Brother Dao can refine Demon-Luring Pills, I should be able to get more later.” Jin Suanpan smiled confidently.

“Should?” Yang Ji gave him a skeptical look.

“Although all major forces are buying Bewitching Demon Grass at high prices in the Demonic Scent Sea, as long as Brother Dao can refine Demon-Luring Pills and provide enough leverage, I believe we can definitely get a share of the pie.” Jin Suanpan chuckled.

“Your Jin family is a large clan with several Golden Core True Persons presiding over it. I imagine you've acquired quite a bit of Bewitching Demon Grass. Why don't you...” Yang Ji gave him a look that said, 'you know what I mean.'

“Brother Dao, stop right there! The clan is the clan, and I am me. I don't want to involve the clan in everything. If the clan gets involved, it just creates more trouble, and my actions would inevitably be constrained.” Jin Suanpan spoke quite seriously this time.

“This...” Yang Ji glanced at him, nodded, and asked, “Can I buy Bewitching Demon Grass with spirit stones? Does it have to be Demon-Luring Pills?”

“Spirit stones can buy some Bewitching Demon Grass below sixty years old. High-aged Bewitching Demon Grass requires cultivation pills, and naturally, Demon-Luring Pills work too. After all, those demon hunters aren't foolish; they risk their lives precisely for cultivation resources, don't they?” Jin Suanpan smiled faintly.

“How should Bewitching Demon Grass and demon cores be paired to refine a Demon Essence Pill that's better than a Spirit Yuan Pill?” Yang Ji asked.

“The Spirit Yuan Pill is a mid-grade spiritual pill. Generally, it requires Bewitching Demon Grass aged over a hundred years paired with a Level 7 demon core. Only then will the refined Demon Essence Pill have a better effect than the Spirit Yuan Pill.” Jin Suanpan explained.

“So, what are the ages of the three stalks you have?” Yang Ji asked.

“One stalk is sixty years old, and two stalks are one hundred and twelve years old. These latter two grew together, which is why their ages are similar.” Jin Suanpan replied.

“Give me the two century-old stalks. The sixty-year-old stalk will be refined into a Demon-Luring Pill, which you can then take to exchange for more Bewitching Demon Grass with other cultivators. Then bring them back to me; the grass produces pills, and you continue to exchange.” Yang Ji stated.

“Brother Dao, wait a minute, let's sort this out. This seems a bit off. I don't seem to be getting any benefits; instead, I'm just running errands? Your business dealings are more outrageous than mine. You didn't learn this from my Uncle Fu, did you?” Jin Suanpan was stunned.

“What else do you want? Isn't it your honor to run errands for me, a peak Pill Refiner?” Yang Ji said with an arrogant expression, mimicking Huoyuan's tone.

“Brother Dao, you're clearly trying to exploit me.” Jin Suanpan couldn't help but smile bitterly.

“Sixty-year-old Bewitching Demon Grass can be bought with spirit stones. So, after I refine it into Demon-Luring Pills, I can just take them to exchange for high-grade Bewitching Demon Grass with other cultivators. Why would I need to go through you and all that trouble?” Yang Ji retorted.

“Brother Dao, you don't really think it's that simple, do you? The Demonic Scent Sea is full of intricate forces. Rogue cultivators always form groups, backed by either the Three Great Sects or some major clans and powers. For a rogue pill refiner like you, with no background, if they discover you, it would be a blessing if they don't imprison you just to refine pills. And you think you can just go around buying Bewitching Demon Grass with pills? Don't even think about it.”

“You're not like me. I have the Jin family's background and I'm a disciple of the Canglan Sect. I have extensive connections and can navigate among rogue cultivators. The various gangs and forces will give me some face. Plus, I know many sect disciples. If I go out to make exchanges, it will definitely be much more convenient than for you, don't you agree?” Jin Suanpan chuckled, his eyes darting slightly. Above his head, the tags [Intimidation], [Smugness], and [Manipulation] appeared.

Intimidating me? Yang Ji snorted inwardly, then calmly smiled, “Since you do have some use, then we'll split the profits from the transaction ninety-ten. You'll get one tenth just for running errands. I imagine anyone else would be quite happy with that.”

Hearing this, Jin Suanpan's eye twitched violently. He said, “Thirty-seventy! I get seventy, you get thirty.”

“Alright, then it's thirty-seventy, you get thirty, I get seventy. If you're unwilling, then we'll part ways here.” Yang Ji said, already making to stand up.

“Hey, hey, hey, Brother Dao, don't, don't, don't!” Seeing Yang Ji's resolute intention, Jin Suanpan grew anxious.

Still trying to trick me? You're far worse than Jin Dafu. Seeing his expression, Yang Ji secretly chuckled.

“How about it, thirty-seventy?” Yang Ji asked indifferently.

“This... fine.” Jin Suanpan could only nod helplessly, his eyes flickering slightly, unsure what crooked ideas he was cooking up.

“Don't worry, follow me, and you'll make a profit!” Yang Ji said with the air of an elder brother, smiling as he patted his shoulder.

If this transaction could truly succeed, having someone run errands outside would be ideal; he didn't want the trouble.
