# Chapter 324: The Taoist Altar in Action

Bi Sheng had lived for nearly two centuries. With the revival of spiritual energy from heaven and earth, he could even extend his life further by using the secret martial arts exclusive to the Taoist Sect, aided by precious medicinal pills. How could a young girl like Su Wanqing compare to him?

Standing with his hands behind his back, Bi Sheng spoke with a leisurely yet arrogant tone: "Little Su, this old Taoist had already stepped into the ninth level of Qi Refining at forty-five. Your progress..."

He shook his head meaningfully and clicked his tongue, full of self-satisfaction.

"Still lacks some refinement."

Su Wanqing's willow-like eyebrows furrowed upon hearing this. The sword case at her waist made a *zheng* sound, springing open three inches. A cold gleam flashed but suddenly stopped.

Her knuckles turned white as she pressed down on the sword case. A struggle raged within her, and her expression shifted unpredictably.

She could indeed make a move.

But this old Taoist before her was unfathomable. Even with her ninth-level cultivation, victory was not guaranteed.

What was more troublesome was that if a major fight broke out here, it would be a minor issue to alert the Imperial City Guard, but if it were to reach the Empress's ears...

She knew that master's temperament all too well.

The Taoist Sect could act without restraint because they had always maintained a distant relationship with the imperial court.

But the Celestial Pivot Gate was different. Over the years, their foothold in the Great Zhou was solely due to the Empress's favor. Otherwise, the Celestial Pivot Gate would still be labeled a heretical sect by the six major sects of Great Zhou.

If the Empress found out about the taboo of privately hiding the Dragon Vein Map, even though the Celestial Pivot Gate was her most capable henchman, with her nature of preferring to kill a thousand innocents than let one guilty escape, she would undoubtedly sever this arm without hesitation.

"To the common martial artists of the world, the Celestial Pivot Gate might be considered a high-level sect..."

Seeing that Su Wanqing hesitated to make a move, Bi Sheng felt relieved. He naturally understood that she was constrained by her worries and dared not go all out, for the price of going all out would be something Su Wanqing could hardly bear.

His gaze was sharp, and his words were锋芒毕露 (sharp and aggressive), "But in the face of the six great orthodox Taoist gates of Great Zhou, it is nothing more than that. Even the now-destroyed Nine Luminaries Sect..."

He deliberately dragged out his voice, "Its remnants could still pin the Great Qian's iron cavalry in Yanbei Dao, preventing them from advancing an inch. Such foundation, how can an ordinary sect compare?"

Su Wanqing remained silent for a long time before finally speaking: "You only want the Profound Heaven Treasure Canon?"

Bi Sheng nodded slightly, "Naturally. As long as you give me the original of the Profound Heaven Treasure Canon, I will act as if this matter never happened."

Xu Yunfan, watching from the side, saw the situation clearly and couldn't help but secretly praise Bi Sheng's shrewdness. This old Taoist advanced step by step, every word like a precise weight, pressing right on the critical point of Su Wanqing's psychological defense.

Su Wanqing's knuckles turned white, her jade nails digging deep into her palm.

When she broke through to the ninth level at sixty, how high-spirited she was, thinking that from then on, the Celestial Pivot Gate could officially rank among the first-rate sects of Great Zhou.

But now, this top-tier cultivation had become the heaviest shackle.

Over the years, she had become deeply bound to the Empress, like two grasshoppers on the same string.

If she were to forcefully withdraw now, not to mention that the Empress would surely launch a relentless pursuit, even if she managed to escape by a fluke.

Looking at the martial world, the six great Taoist gates controlled the strategic points, and the three mountains and five peaks were all their places of spreading the Tao.

The actions of the Celestial Pivot Gate over the years had already cut off all paths of retreat.

Difficult, difficult, difficult!

After a long while, Su Wanqing spoke in a low voice.

"You only want the Profound Heaven Treasure Canon?"

"Naturally."

"This treasure canon records only the misty and uncertain matters of eating clouds and drinking dew..."

A hint of sarcasm also appeared on her face: "If not for your impending end of lifespan, Daoist Bi, would you also learn from those mortals and seek immortality?"

Emperors sought immortality, she naturally knew that, but how could there be immortality in this world? Even those legendary Land Immortals have now returned to dust.

Bi Sheng smiled and said solemnly: "This poor Taoist eats the food of the Three Pure Ones, chants the Yellow Court Classic. Seeking immortals and visiting the Tao is precisely my duty."

Hearing this, Su Wanqing no longer hesitated and took out a yellowed leather scroll from her chest.

The edges of the scroll were worn and frayed. When unrolled, one could even hear the faint sound of fibers cracking. It was the original *Profound Heaven Treasure Canon* that had been passed down for six hundred years by the Celestial Pivot Gate.

This core cultivation method for breaking through the External Three Unions realm, though capable of condensing a domineering and unparalleled true qi to allow the practitioner to fight across realms, had a fatal flaw: the practitioner's flesh and internal organs would be continuously eroded by the violent true qi.

Even though the历代圣子圣女 (Saints and Saintesses of past generations) were exceptionally talented, they all ended up stopping at the External Three Unions realm due to their bodies being riddled with wounds, becoming "lamp burners" on the path to the peak of martial arts.

This method of seeking short-term gain at the cost of long-term ruin meant that although the experts of the Celestial Pivot Gate could briefly unleash power beyond their realm, they could never produce a true Grandmaster.

Sixty years ago, Su Wanqing was able to break through the shackles and achieve the ninth level of Qi Refining precisely because she cultivated another martial art.

Now, this sect is still trapped in the martial arts paradox of "harming others before harming oneself." Those seemingly brilliant Saints and Saintesses are merely fleeting sparks ignited by burning their meridians.

Therefore, when Bi Sheng asked for the original Profound Heaven Treasure Canon, Su Wanqing didn't feel much heartache; in fact, she felt a sense of relief.

In this way, she wouldn't have to let the talented individuals of the Celestial Pivot Gate charge one after another onto this dead end.

Bi Sheng flipped through it casually.

He nodded slightly: "It is the original."

He looked up at Su Wanqing, cupped his hands, and was about to speak when Su Wanqing had already turned into a frost-colored afterimage and vanished from the altar.

Bi Sheng's gaze sharpened, then he chuckled and shook his head. After confirming no one was around, he said in a low voice: "Let's leave first. The Imperial City Guard's Black-armored Guards patrol every half-incense stick. This place is not suitable for a long stay."

He specifically chose this location to make it difficult for Su Wanqing to make a move.

Xu Yunfan understood and nodded; he had no objections.

The two used the cover of the night mist, moving swiftly along the shadows of the water channels. They changed directions three times to avoid patrol routes and finally returned to the Taoist Sect's residence through a side door.

The stone lanterns in the small blue-brick courtyard glowed with a dim yellow light. Bi Sheng closed the door behind him, listened carefully to confirm no one was around, and then took out an ancient scroll from his chest.

Bi Sheng slowly unfurled the ancient book that emitted a bronze-like dark luster, his fingers stroking the mottled cover of the *Profound Heaven Treasure Canon*, filled with endless emotion.

"The Taoist Sect's Scripture Pavilion also has a copy of this, but its true meaning is less than one-tenth preserved. Only the original can reveal a fraction of its essence. But after all these years, it's still better than nothing..."

"These complex characters only reveal their form when infused with spiritual energy. When spiritual energy is depleted, it's just a piece of scrap iron."

"These characters of the Heavenly Demon... could it be that this object originally came from beyond the domain?"

Bi Sheng nodded slightly: "During the great calamity two thousand years ago, a Heavenly Demon known as the 'Crimson-Eyed Demon Lord' slaughtered three provinces. In the end, Patriarch Chunyang obliterated him with the Nine Heavens Thunder Method. This scroll was抽出 (drawn out) from his body."

The name Patriarch Chunyang had been like thunder in Xu Yunfan's ears since he joined the Taoist Sect.

This peerless figure who suppressed an entire era two thousand years ago was the most brilliant and peerless extreme cultivator in the history of the Taoist Sect.

According to the *Taoist Sect Golden Register*, he understood the essence of the *Yellow Court Classic* at nine, created the Pure Yang One Qi Technique at twelve, and broke through the ninth-level shackles in his thirties, becoming the last Land Immortal of his time.
