Chapter 95: Hot Pot Restaurant Opens

In a hidden room deep within the government office's back hall, a stark contrast to the bustling front hall, a white-robed youth with a gloomy complexion sat alone, drinking by himself. If he were to step out into the hall, he would be easily recognizable as Yin Huacheng.

The door to the hidden room burst open, and Cui, the government office's chief, entered. With a subtle exertion of his energy, the alcohol fumes emanating from him dissipated, and his drunken demeanor transformed into a sharp, alert state.

"Sorry to keep you waiting, Yin Huacheng. I'm afraid I've been busy with official duties. I deserve a reprimand," Cui said with a smile as he sat down across from Yin Huacheng, pouring him a cup of tea.

Yin Huacheng gazed at the teacup, his eyes narrowed, before downing the tea in one gulp. He chuckled lightly. "Between us, there's no need for pretenses. Or have you been in office for too long and started to take yourself too seriously?"

Cui's smile gradually faded as he replied, "You're looking for Li Mo and Ying Bing, but they're not here today, Yin Huacheng, the facilitator."

Yin Huacheng's finger tapped on the table. "No matter. Just inform me the moment you find them."

"I came for another matter," Yin Huacheng continued. "The goods we ordered from the Demonic Cult... it's been a while, and I'm still waiting."

Cui sighed, his eyes half-closed. "The timing is bad. If our dealings are exposed, I'll be finished as the chief. The upper echelons of the Fine Rain Tower will hold me accountable, so I must be cautious."

Yin Huacheng's expression turned uncertain. The "business" they referred to wasn't the cooperation between Fine Rain Tower and the Demonic Cult but a secret deal between Cui and Yin Huacheng's father.

"Didn't you keep the major sects' representatives detained in the government office?" Yin Huacheng pressed on. "They're under your surveillance. What do you have to fear?"

Cui set his teacup down with a clang, his smile now cold. "Just because they're under my watch doesn't mean I'm not under theirs. I'll send someone to handle the matter. Your father is already aware."

The conversation concluded with Yin Huacheng's departure, leaving Cui to mutter, "How did Yin Xuan declare produce such a foolish son?"

Later, a figure slid into the room, taking the form of a monk in a wide robe with a smiling Buddha mask.

"The Hall's Swallows have been dispatched, Chief," the monk reported.

Cui handed the monk a pouch. "I have a personal task for you. Discreetly gather some orphaned children and bring them to my private residence."

The monk agreed, and their transaction was settled.

Meanwhile, in an inn, Li Mo and his companions had transformed the place into a hot pot restaurant, "Joyful and Prosperous." The aroma wafting from the restaurant attracted a group of escorts, who decided to stop by for the night.

As they entered, the bustling atmosphere enveloped them. The hot pot restaurant was a hit, and it wasn't long before more people began to arrive, drawn by the enticing smells and the lively ambiance.

The story unfolded as the characters navigated their respective paths, with Cui handling his clandestine matters and Li Mo's group blending into the crowd, gathering information, and awaiting the outcome of the trials ahead.
