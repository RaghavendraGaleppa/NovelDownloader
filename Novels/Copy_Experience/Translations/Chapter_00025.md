**Chapter 25: It's Hard to Be a Live-in Son-in-Law**

"This..."

Lu Xu was already getting restless hearing this. In his eyes, Qinghu Market had clearly become a powder keg.

"Leave! We must leave!" Old Man Xu said decisively.

"Leave for what?" Han Erlengzi was stunned, somewhat confused.

Only then did Old Man Xu realize there was a Mo family live-in son-in-law present, and some topics couldn't be discussed. He coughed dryly, "I mean, we must go out and constantly gather information. We can't keep holed up at home like this, cut off from the outside!" Old Man Xu shot a glance at Lu Xu, signaling him not to tell Han Erlengzi about his desire to leave Qinghu Market. He now had no good feelings towards anyone associated with the Mo family.

"Sigh, Old Xu, you're right. I've only recently realized how important it is to be well-informed!" Han Erlengzi lamented. "Becoming this Mo family live-in son-in-law, I truly regret it to death!"

Han Erlengzi began pouring out his grievances to the two of them. He had come specifically to complain and, incidentally, to see if these two could offer him any advice. After his narration, Lu Xu learned that among the fifty people previously sent by the Mo family to explore the ruins, nearly twenty were live-in sons-in-law of the Mo family. As a result, more than half of them died in that expedition.

Being a live-in son-in-law for the Mo family was not easy. If they couldn't meet the Mo family's fertility quota, a life akin to slavery awaited them. Those live-in sons-in-law sent to explore the ruins were the ones who hadn't met the quota. They generally only had Qi Refinement Stage three or four cultivation, clearly treated as cannon fodder.

Han Erlengzi knew about the Mo family's fertility quota; they had made it clear to him before marriage. But he was too young then and didn't know how difficult it was for cultivators to bear offspring. Furthermore, at the time, he was utterly infatuated by the Mo family's young women, and with the arrow on the bowstring, he was about to lose control. How could he have carefully listened to those conditions? As a result, he was now on a pirate ship with no way off.

He had recently met many senior live-in sons-in-law, and after chatting with them, he realized how difficult it was to meet the Mo family's fertility quota. Some couldn't even produce a child with spiritual root aptitude, let alone an ordinary one. In desperation, they could only secretly take their wives outside the market and find mortal men to conceive a child. This was done to buy time and escape the Mo family's punishment. To complete the fertility quota, most live-in sons-in-law would desperately 'plow,' only hoping to produce a son or daughter. In this way, cultivation would become an impossible thought!

"Sigh, what should I do? Big Brother Lu, please help me come up with an idea!"

After Han Erlengzi finished speaking, he saw Old Man Xu, who was chuckling coldly non-stop on the side, and he became furious. "Old Xu, are you really that happy?" He widened his eyes.

"I just remembered something happy!" Old Man Xu was completely unafraid, openly mocking Erlengzi.

"Sigh, I'm already so miserable, and you're still like this. We're neighbors, can't you help me with an idea?" Erlengzi sighed in deep sorrow.

"Don't be like others who desperately try to raise their cultivation after getting the Mo family's resources. You should know, the higher the cultivation, the harder it is to have offspring!" Old Xu advised. "First, go have children. Only consider cultivation after you've met the fertility quota!" After venting his unhappiness, he still offered a useful suggestion.

Lu Xu pondered for a moment, then also said, "Have you looked into the menstrual cycles of your wives?"

Han Erlengzi left with two valuable pieces of advice. Lu Xu and Old Man Xu returned to their respective rooms with gloomy expressions. Both were pondering the matter of leaving the market. With the current level of information blockade outside, leaving was practically impossible. They could only wait and see how things developed. And this change, Lu Xu and the others quickly awaited.

Three days later, Lu Xu successfully produced another Vajra Talisman. After going out to inquire, he quickly received news that the Mo family's Old Ancestor had departed this morning. The Mo family's Foundation Establishment Old Ancestor led a team of over 150 cultivators towards the Ten Thousand Monster Mountain Range.

"Leave!" Upon hearing this news, Lu Xu and Old Man Xu immediately made a decision. The Mo family's Old Ancestor had taken so many people; the market must be empty. More than half of the personnel blocking information would likely be withdrawn. Now, the news definitely couldn't be blocked! The opportunity to leave Qinghu Market was here.

"I now have four Vajra Talismans, two Blazing Fire Talismans, and about thirty low-grade talismans!" Lu Xu thought to himself. "With these, I can protect myself. There's no time to make more now; I must seize this opportunity!" Lu Xu thought this to himself and waited quietly.

In the evening, Lu Xu's door was knocked. Old Man Xu had dressed up, bringing his grandson to bid farewell to Lu Xu: "Little Lu, I'm going to try again tonight. Maybe I can successfully break out!"

"Old Xu, be careful!" Lu Xu said with a serious expression.

"I'll be careful tonight, and I reckon I'm not the only one who wants to escape. I'll seize the opportunity amidst the chaos!" Old Man Xu said meaningfully. Lu Xu nodded upon hearing this. At this moment, there were probably many cultivators wanting to escape. Some, like Old Man Xu and Lu Xu, simply wanted to avoid danger. Others, however, wanted to quickly send out intelligence to let their forces know about the appearance of the Divine Wood Sect ruins here. Just as the Mo family had planted agents in other markets, other forces would naturally have their own moles within the Mo family's domain.

Old Xu respectfully cupped his hands in a salute: "From now on, we might find it hard to meet again. I hope the next time I hear your name, you will already be a renowned High-grade Talisman Master!"

Lu Xu smiled, "Then I'll accept your good wishes. I also wish your grandson success in his cultivation!"

"Come, Yuanxiang, greet Senior Lu!" Old Xu pulled Xu Yuanxiang forward.

"Senior Lu, take care!" Xu Yuanxiang bowed respectfully in a proper manner.

Lu Xu also bowed to the grandfather and grandson, as a farewell. A moment later, Old Xu quickly left the courtyard with his grandson.

Not long after, Lu Xu put on his bronze mask, changed his appearance, and secretly followed behind them. Qinghu Market had a curfew at night; cultivators were not allowed to enter or exit, or even walk on the streets within the market. The market's entrance would be completely closed at night. Under the cover of a Tier 2 grand formation, no one could force their way in. So, for those like Lu Xu who wanted to leave, they had to depart the market before the curfew.

Lu Xu transformed into a cold man in black, walking out of the market with an expressionless face. Ahead, lay a vast expanse of green fields. Lu Xu had seen this scene many times. But seeing it now, a few more emotions welled up in his heart. After all, he had lived here for seven years; now it was finally time to leave. Glancing at Old Man Xu and his grandson ahead, Lu Xu slowly followed.
