# Chapter 295: The Beast Calamity Approaches, the System Ranking Restarts!

In the Qingmu City, which was currently enjoying a brief moment of peace and tranquility, and the Senluo Valley thousands of miles away...

The valley, usually shrouded in poisonous miasma all year round, was now falling with thick, cotton-like grey snow.

With the arrival of winter, the place seemed even more devoid of light, making it impossible to distinguish between day and night or the four cardinal directions. A piercing cold wind blew from the depths of the valley, sounding like the weeping of night ghosts.

Deep within the valley, the gates of a temple adorned with murals of various divine beings remained tightly shut.

If one looked closely, they would notice that the creatures depicted in the colorful murals bore a striking resemblance to the ferocious Disaster Beasts standing outside.

"That damned鸣蛟族 (Ming蛟 Clan), pretending to be ignorant! The Human Race's Hidden Dragon List has already been issued, yet they still feign ignorance that Wu Mo is a human!"

A strange bird with several heads spoke in a cacophony of voices. Its body was covered in wounds that had yet to heal.

"Hahaha, remember how the鬼车族 (Gui车 Clan) used to feed on the Ming蛟? Now, you can't even deal with a single fifth-rank Ming蛟."

A怪兽 resembling a large dog let out a strange laugh.

"Laughing at me? You吼族 (Roar Clan) used to boast about eating True Dragons. How are things now? You almost got beaten to a pulp by the巨鲸族 (Giant Whale Clan)."

"Damn it! I am a Hound, not a dog! I told you Wu Mo is a human, but none of you brutes understand a single word!"

"Stupid dog."

"You dare say that again?!"

Obviously, one head was no match for five.

Just as the two Disaster Beasts were about to fight, the others merely sneered, not a single one stepping in to stop them.

"Hmph."

A cold snort that sounded neither human nor beast rang out, causing the two beasts to sulkily back down.

"Hall Master."

The figure was shrouded in a black robe, with only half a face visible, covered in strange tattoos.

It was the Hall Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall.

Standing beside him were figures wearing bronze masks, clearly the High Priests of various cities.

Not long after...

*Rumble—*

The heavy gates of the temple rumbled open. A figure clad in a thin blood-colored robe stepped out.

"Master Han."

The numerous Disaster Beasts, unusually well-behaved, lowered their heads.

"Master Han, the treasure arm you requested has been forged."

The Hall Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall presented a jade box. Inside lay a purplish-blue arm with tangled blood vessels, and a mouth full of sharp teeth in the palm.

Han Xin casually beckered, and a Yin Wind lifted the arm and floated it before him.

He tore off his own withered arm as if snapping a dry branch and tossed it away, where it was devoured by the purplish-blue arm.

A moment later, blood threads grew from the end of the purplish-blue arm and attached themselves to his shoulder.

Han Xin's eyes, which seemed to flicker with ghostly fire, swept over the sea of Disaster Beasts and said softly:

"You were once revered as gods, totems of great tribes, pillars of dynasties, enjoying supreme glory."

"And now, we can only cower in this bitter, cold land of the Southern Frontier, drinking blood and eating raw flesh."

The bloodthirsty expressions of the Disaster Beasts momentarily faltered.

Once upon a time, they were the masters of this Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. They received the reverence and worship of the world, like gods.

But now...

They seemed to have been reduced to mere beasts?

"Now, the chance to revive the Divine Tree and welcome back the Ancestral Spirits is right before us!"

"The妖兽 (Demon Beasts) are ultimately a pile of loose sand. The fact that Li Mo and Ying Bing are humans is now plain for all to see. They have no reason to stop us anymore."

"Are you willing to storm Qingmu City, retrieve the Divine Jade, and reclaim the glory of the past?"

In the Senluo Valley, where the north wind blew coldly...

Roars that shook the heavens drowned out the weeping of ghosts and scattered the layers of clouds.

...

"I won't see you out then."

"Farewell."

Young Master Zhong didn't seem to react in time.

This was the private room he had booked.

He had just arranged to meet Li Mo tomorrow and was rushing back to the military camp, eager to train his personal guards through the night.

His father often said that a truly invincible general does not rely on personal bravery, but on commanding and training an army.

"Young Master Zhong seems to have changed his carriage?"

Li Mo watched the carriage disappear, feeling a bit strange.

---

To an ordinary family, this carriage would be quite decent, but for someone of Zhong Zhenyue's status, it seemed a bit shabby.

Perhaps he was in a hurry to leave.

Li Mo didn't think too much of it.

He turned and walked back into the inn, heading straight for the kitchen. It had been a while since he had cooked a proper meal for the Ice Cube.

The chef initially thought this young man was here to cause trouble, until he took out his ingredients.

After preparing four simple dishes and a soup, he returned upstairs.

He took the candle from the lampshade and replaced it with a glowing clam pearl. Then, he sat on the bed and began cultivating, suppressing the light of the Jade Phoenix God.

Night fell.

As he practiced, the sound of splashing water suddenly reached his ears.

The Ice Cube had taken off her socks and boots, placing her smooth, slender legs into the wooden basin. Occasionally, she would splash the water. Although she was spotlessly clean, she had been washing her feet quite often lately.

*Splash—*

A water droplet flew out and landed right on Li Mo's forehead.

"Be serious," Ying Bing said, her lips pressed together, her voice clear and melodious.

Who stares at someone else while they wash their feet?

"Ice Cube, help me out."

"......"

Isn't it strange?

Even without opening his eyes, just listening to the sounds, the images come to mind. He even feels an urge to use the "Plucking Flowers" technique.

This occupational hazard is truly frightening. No wonder it's a supreme skill.

"Don't do that again."

Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed.

How many times had she said this already?

"Next time for sure!"

Li Mo's eyes were filled with determination.

Ying Bing's gaze deepened, and the air in the room suddenly grew colder. A light like flowing water rippled over her body.

In no time, her attire had changed into an ice-colored "Fairy Skirt," with frost flowers seemingly drifting between her strands of hair.

The naturally cool and aloof Ice Cube became even more distant and untouchable, an aura of holiness emanating from her.

This would have been fine.

But after she dried her feet, she sat with her legs crossed, her gaze a mix of indifference and reproach.

Perhaps even she wasn't aware of how deadly this contrast was.

The Cold Goose Form.

As a divine technique, if the Jade Phoenix Form had a consciousness, it would probably wish to rot away within the Jade Phoenix God, knowing it was being used in such a way.

"Let's practice properly now. Otherwise, I'll go book another room."

"....."

Li Mo felt he needed to look at a monkey to calm down, so he took out the "Wukong Seeking the Dao" painting.

"Really... you're getting more and more brazen..."

Ying Bing retracted her playful gaze, and her clenched fingers finally relaxed.

She let out a soft breath, her gaze turning towards the distant south.

*'The Hidden Dragon and the Young Phoenix unite, the winds and clouds stir across the Four Seas and Eight Wastes.'*

This was the evaluation given by the Heavenly Derivation Sect.

Their trip to the Southern Frontier has likely caused some irreversible changes to this place, and might even cause certain events to be triggered earlier?

Ying Bing frowned in thought.

Also.

The System Ranking.

Having delayed for so long, she calculated that she had missed out on quite a few rewards...

[Ding—]

[Host, you've finally remembered this system, haven't you? It's just a minor punishment, what is it compared to the rewards?]

[Congratulations on finally coming to your senses!]

[Do you wish to开启 this ranking?]
