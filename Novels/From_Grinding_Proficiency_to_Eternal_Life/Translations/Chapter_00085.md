# Chapter 85: Sky-Silk

Amidst the flying stone chips, the Sect Master used his severed limb to hook up a wine jar and took a hearty gulp. He wiped his mouth and shook his head.

"Sigh, it's getting worse and worse. When Founder Li Jinglei practiced this move back in the day, he shattered his own ancestral hall! Now, it's a bit strenuous just to break a stone tablet."

As he spoke, Chen Tiangang glanced at Xu Yunfan with a slightly trembling hand, concealing the shock in his heart.

"Let's try once more."

Upon hearing Chen Tiangang's words.

Xu Yunfan's shoulder blades suddenly erupted with fine tremors, and when his arms swung out, they actually brought forth a dozen or so afterimages.

The candlelight on the cave walls flickered and went out under the force of the gale. Where the fist wind swept past, the three-inch-thick bluestone floor was plowed with spider-web-like cracks.

Cicada's Cry.

This was a unique high-frequency oscillation technique for generating force after the Sky Cicada Strength had integrated the bones and tendons, and it was also one of the core techniques of the Sky Cicada Sect.

"Crack!"

As the final punch was retracted, Xu Yunfan's forearm skin took on a strange grayish-green color, and the bones beneath his skin slowly reset as if they were living creatures.

As his great tendons snapped, the blue veins and patterns all over his body were squeezed and changed, vaguely resembling the patterns on cicada wings. The sound of blood and energy churning like a river flowed from beneath his skin.

"Twenty days to integrate the generation of force, three days to circulate throughout the body."

Chen Tiangang's eyes flashed with a sharp light, and the fingers hanging by his side trembled slightly.

This record had even surpassed the sect's founding ancestor, who had gone mad and died after seven days of seclusion in a dead-end retreat.

Besides the Sky Cicada Sect's founding ancestor, Li Jinglei, no one had ever achieved what Xu Yunfan had. It was understandable to enter the sect in a month, but to integrate the bones, tendons, and skin to generate force within just three days after entering the sect...

Xu Yunfan's mouth twitched slightly, and he silently glanced at the faint, cicada-wing-like patterns on Chen Tiangang's body, which were rapidly spreading across his entire body as he subconsciously exerted force.

That was the anomaly brought about by the Sky Cicada Robe, a technique for blood transformation.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's gaze, Chen Tiangang's face showed a hint of a smile: "This is a characteristic that appears on the body after the Sky Cicada Robe is cultivated to the Blood Transformation Realm. Once the blood and energy boil and become extremely active, cicada patterns can appear on the skin. At that time, one's hardening training will be invincible among peers..."

He coughed dryly: "If you can reach the External Three Unions Grand Master realm and pass the sect assessment, I will teach it to you."

Suddenly, the sound of clothes whistling through the air came from outside the cave. Ning Wuque's blue robe hem was still stained with morning dew, but when he landed, the tip of his foot crushed a half-inch dent in the blue bricks.

When he bowed, the blue veins on his neck kept undulating, revealing the effortless feeling of the Sky Cicada Strength, yet his voice remained gentle and warm: "The weather is warming up now, and the ground has softened again. The heretics of the Incense Fire Cult have already broken seven cities in a row. The Wuzhou army urgently needs the elite of various sects to assist in defense. They are called the Demon-Sweeping Heavenly Army. Wherever they pass, not even birds or beasts survive."

"Master, the Wuzhou army has already sent word. They require the sects of the Five Ridges and Seven Mountains of Wuzhou to send people to join the Wuzhou army and jointly resist the Incense Fire Cult."

Chen Tiangang heard this, and his fingers subconsciously snapped three of his beard hairs. He nodded slightly and said, "This is naturally the right thing to do. As a part of Wuzhou, the Sky Cicada Sect naturally needs to send people."

Just as Ning Wuque was about to speak, Chen Tiangang directly said: "The Fourth Senior Brother has been cultivating on the mountain for many years and hasn't moved around much. The Third Senior Brother is familiar with the Wuzhou officialdom. Let the Third and Fourth Senior Brothers lead eight inner sect disciples and two hundred outer sect disciples to go. Wuque, as your senior brother, you are about to break through to the External Three Unions realm. Our Sky Cicada Sect's martial arts are mostly honed in battle. You should make this trip. If you return and break through to the Grand Master realm, I will teach you our sect's supreme ultimate skill."

Ning Wuque opened his mouth, then said solemnly, "I will not disgrace the sect!"

His knuckles turned white from gripping, but a spring-like smile appeared on his face.

After speaking, he accepted the order and walked out of the rear hall's Transmission Cave.

Xu Yunfan watched this from the side, standing to one side without making a sound. Chen Tiangang's words had naturally interrupted Ning Wuque's thoughts.

The master's order had been given. If he were to disobey it擅自, it would ruin the image of him as the senior brother in others' hearts.

Moreover, during these days of interaction, although Chen Tiangang treated his disciples well, he was a man of his word and disliked others raising different opinions.

Chu Xuan, who was standing beside them, saw this scene and also dared not speak. She stuck out her tongue and quickly walked to Chen Tiangang's side, grabbing his arm and shaking it.

"Dad, then why isn't Little Junior Brother going? He's also a Three-Stage Martial Teacher. His aptitude is, is a little better than Senior Brother's."

At the age of twenty-one or twenty-two to be a Three-Stage Martial Teacher, apart from the top sects in the Great Zhou and the gathering places of martial artists in the Central Prefecture of the Jade Capital Circuit, in these remote circuits and prefectures, a twenty-one or twenty-two-year-old Three-Stage Martial Teacher's aptitude is truly eye-catching.

A hint of a smile appeared on Chen Tiangang's face: "Your Little Junior Brother's Sky Cicada Strength hasn't even entered the sect yet, so he needs to stay on the mountain to cultivate. Moreover, I have other instructions for him."

Seeing that Chu Xuan wanted to say more, Chen Tiangang waved his hand: "Alright, spend more time with Wuque. He will be descending the mountain soon, and it might be a long time before you see him again."

Hearing Chen Tiangang's words, Chu Xuan also forgot about the little scheme in her heart. She quickly called out "Senior Brother Ning" and ran quickly towards the Transmission Cave.

The always stern Chen Tiangang looked at Chu Xuan's disappearing figure and sighed with some emotion: "Our Sky Cicada Sect is now in a state of decline, but fortunately, we have Ning Wuque and you. I watched Ning Wuque grow up since he was a child. His temperament is excellent, and he is gentle to others. The entire mountain gate is orderly under his management.

"To be honest, before I delegated power, the Sky Cicada Sect was much more dilapidated than it is now. Those hundred thousand mu of fields were mostly barren. After Wuque took over, in less than two or three years, he made the Sky Cicada Sect flourish, and the number of disciples multiplied. After he returns from this trip, I will teach him the Sky Cicada Robe. It's just that..."

Chen Tiangang turned his head and looked at Xu Yunfan: "To enter the Sky Cicada Robe, one needs Sky-Silk as a guide. Now, the Sky Cicada Sect only cultivates two of them. One is waiting to mature, and the other will only be ready in two years. Can you wait?"

Xu Yunfan said: "Please rest assured, Master. I can wait."

Suddenly, his ears twitched slightly, and his eyes seemed to casually sweep over the outer wall of the Transmission Cave.

He remembered that the stone cave next door was the inner treasury of the Sky Cicada Sect. Lin Hanyi once took him there to get a three-hundred-year-old ginseng.

There seemed to be the sound of breathing.

Then he looked at Chen Tiangang, who seemed completely unaware and laughed with satisfaction.

"By then, once you break through, I will take the cocoon and help you achieve the Sky Cicada Robe!"

He didn't pay any more attention to Xu Yunfan and limped out of the Transmission Cave on his own, preparing to apply medicine to his wounds. These were old, chronic injuries that required daily fumigation and dressing.

Xu Yunfan was a bit puzzled. Since almost all the good things were taken by Ning Wuque, why was he being so targeted towards him?

He turned his head and looked at the outer cave wall. The sound of breathing was very familiar to him. Even though it was separated by a cave wall, he could still tell it was Chu Xuan.

She had come back to eavesdrop.

With Chen Tiangang's strength, how could he not be aware of this?

It seemed that Chen Tiangang had done it on purpose, and he had waited until Chu Xuan got close to the cave wall before saying that sentence.

Strange.

In a branching storeroom next door, Chu Xuan's back, pressed against the stone wall, was already soaked in cold sweat.

She had heard the line, "Once you break through, I will take the cocoon." Her mind went blank, and she couldn't see anything clearly.

Chu Xuan's small face showed an anxious expression as she paced back and forth in the storeroom.

"What to do, what to do... If it's all given to that big guy, won't Senior Brother be unable to cultivate the Sky Cicada Robe?!"

Suddenly, her anxious pacing came to a halt.

"No, I have to tell Senior Brother about this and have him think of a way to talk to Dad about it."

Just as Chu Xuan walked out of the inner storeroom, she ran head-on into Xu Yunfan, who was standing at the entrance of the cave. Her face tightened, then she quickly composed herself.

"Little Junior Brother, you scared me, coming out like that."

"Senior Sister, do you know what the Master and I just talked about inside?"

Chu Xuan's expression remained normal as she said with a charming laugh, "What the Master and his disciples talk about, how would I know?"

Just as Xu Yunfan was about to say something, Chu Xuan said, "Some things, you can only understand if you see and hear them for yourself."

Xu Yunfan's eyes deepened. He fell silent for a moment, then said no more and stepped aside to let her pass.

Watching Chu Xuan's rapidly departing back, his eyes flickered.

This woman seemed to have been used as a pawn.

With Chen Tiangang's words, Chu Xuan would definitely tell Ning Wuque, thus creating a rift between them. What good would that do him?

The young girl's feet seemed to generate wind. Her鹿皮 short boots embroidered with gold threads crushed the dry branches. As she hurriedly passed through the training grounds, the silver bells on her waist jingled.

Ning Wuque, who was practicing grappling techniques with the Third Senior Brother, turned his head at the sound and was just in time to be grabbed by the girl by his wide sleeve embroidered with cloud patterns.

"Senior Brother, what's the matter, being so secretive about it?"
