# Chapter 11: Blackwater Pond Auction

The auction was to be held at Blackwater Pond—a location Wei Qian was quite familiar with, as it was the spiritual vein territory occupied by the Wang Clan, a prominent cultivation family.  

Wei Qian found it odd that an auction jointly organized by the Liuyun Sect and the Xiao Clan would be hosted by the Wang family. However, after a conversation with Li Guchen, he learned the reason: the Wang Clan had suffered heavy losses during the recent extermination of demonic cultivators.  

By proposing to hold the auction at Blackwater Pond, the Liuyun Sect was indirectly helping the Wang Clan recover some of their losses. After all, thousands of cultivators would gather for the event, and the sheer volume of food, lodging, and other expenses would bring the Wang family a tidy profit.  

"What a shame," Li Guchen sighed as they descended the mountain. "That old ancestor of the Wang Clan only suffered severe injuries. If he had died at the hands of the demonic cultivators, things would have been much better for us."  

"Strength comes from within," Wei Qian replied. "If you worked harder and became a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the Li family's troubles would be resolved easily."  

Over the past few days, Wei Qian had learned why the Li and Wang families were at odds.  

Ten years ago, the Wang Clan had produced a newly ascended Foundation Establishment cultivator. With their original elder Foundation Establishment expert still alive, the Wang family's power surged, and they immediately set their sights on expansion.  

Their target? The Li family of Misty Ridge Mountain—a clan in decline, with only one aging Foundation Establishment elder left.  

The Li family's decision to recruit tenant farmers was also a direct result of the Wang family's interference.  

Wei Qian's suggestion for the Li family to produce another Foundation Establishment cultivator was indeed the best solution. However, Li Guchen shook his head vigorously. "Me, a Foundation Establishment expert? Forget it. You'd have better luck hoping my father makes the breakthrough."  

As they conversed, the two reached the foot of the mountain, where a group was already waiting.  

Wei Qian glanced over and saw that the young mistress, Li Caiwei, was also among them.  

"Come and get your horses!" a rough voice called out.  

The speaker was a burly man with bronze skin that gleamed like polished copper under the sunlight.  

Li Guchen lowered his voice. "That's Uncle Wanhai. He's at the seventh level of Qi Refinement and has trained in a body-tempering technique. With him leading us, this trip will be absolutely safe!"  

As they approached, each of them received a tall, sturdy horse.  

"Is this a Brawny Savage Horse?" Wei Qian's eyes lit up as he examined the muscular steed with its glossy coat.  

These horses were said to carry a trace of demon beast bloodline, capable of galloping eight hundred li in a single day.

The distance between Misty Ridge Mountain and Blackwater Pond wasn't far—only sixteen hundred li. Two days of travel would suffice.  

With the auction still three days away, they had ample time to make the journey and rest for a day before the event.  

As the sun rose halfway over the eastern horizon, Li Wanhai wasted no time. "Everyone's here. Let's move out!" he declared, spurring his horse forward. The rest of the Li family quickly followed.  

Wei Qian stepped into the stirrup, swung himself onto the horse, and gripped the reins firmly. With a light kick, the Brawny Savage Horse surged forward, easily keeping pace with the group.  

Li Caiwei slowed slightly to ride alongside him. "You know how to ride?"  

"I've ridden mortal horses in the secular world," Wei Qian replied. "Though they're far inferior to these Brawny Savage Horses."  

"These horses are nothing special," Li Caiwei said. "Once, I saw the Alchemy Cauldron Xiao Clan traveling on Wind Spirit Horses—true ranked demon beasts that could cover three thousand li in a single day, their hooves kicking up gusts of wind as they ran."  

Her words sparked a question in Wei Qian's mind. "I've seen sect cultivators traveling by either riding magical artifacts or flying boats. Why don’t they—"  

He didn't finish, but Li Caiwei understood.  

"It's a matter of cost," she said with a bitter smile.  

Using magical artifacts for flight consumed a cultivator's energy and was only suitable for short distances. Covering thousands of li by artifact would require a Foundation Establishment expert's endurance.  

As for flying boats? Forget the astronomical price of the vessel itself—just the number of spirit stones needed to power it was no small sum.  

Only those wealthy clans sitting on spirit stone mines or the most powerful sects could afford such luxuries.  

"My mistake," Wei Qian quickly conceded.  

As they rode, he noticed the attention Li Caiwei's presence beside him was drawing from the other Li family members. "Don't worry about me, Young Mistress," he said. "I can keep up. You should ride ahead."  

Realizing the impropriety, Li Caiwei nodded and spurred her horse to the front.  

Time flew, and two days passed in a blur.  

After traveling sixteen hundred li, they finally arrived at Blackwater Pond!  

Though called a pond, it spanned twenty li in diameter—more like a small lake.  

The water was pitch black, exuding a chilling aura that formed a thin mist in the air.

"For cultivators with water-aligned spiritual roots, this would be an excellent place for cultivation," Wei Qian mused. "But for those with fire-aligned roots, it would be quite uncomfortable."  

Most cultivators had balanced spiritual roots encompassing the five elements and the three rare attributes.  

However, just as dragons could birth nine different offspring, cultivators' spiritual roots varied in inclination.  

For example, someone who loved nature and wandering through forests likely had a wood-aligned spiritual root.  

Someone who enjoyed swimming, rainy days, and humid climates likely leaned toward water.  

Of course, such crude methods of assessment had long been abandoned in the cultivation world.  

Now, specialized detection compasses could accurately measure spiritual root aptitude and attributes.  

Wei Qian had been tested before—his spiritual roots leaned toward fire and wood among the five elements, and wind and lightning among the three rare attributes.  

Thus, standing near the water-aligned Blackwater Pond, he naturally felt a faint discomfort.  

The Wang family wasn't generous enough to let outsiders get too close to the pond, where the spiritual energy from the first and second-grade spiritual veins would disperse.  

The auction venue had been set up in a clearing ten li away from Blackwater Pond. With the labor of thousands of mortals and dozens of cultivators, a stone hall capable of seating three thousand had been constructed.  

Around the hall, hundreds of tents of varying sizes had been pitched, serving as temporary camps for visiting cultivators.  

Upon arrival, the Li family first contacted the Wang family representatives.  

After learning their identity, the Wang family attendant led them to the most remote area—far from the auction hall—and instructed them to set up camp there.  

The blatant disrespect infuriated the Li family members.  

No sooner had the Wang family cultivator left than Li Guchen cursed aloud, "What kind of nonsense is this?!"
