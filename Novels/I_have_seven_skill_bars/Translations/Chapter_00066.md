# Chapter 66: Why Not Plant Meridian-Opening Flowers Instead?

"Wolf Cultivators, are they a type of evil cultivator?" Ding Rui asked Old Huang.

"Indeed. They are a very powerful group of evil cultivators, and their methods are exceedingly cruel. These injuries of mine were inflicted by those damn Wolf Cultivators. My face is the lightest of it; the worst is on my body, but I won't let you see it, lest you cry from fright," Old Huang said.

"Heh." Ding Rui sneered, then asked again, "So, what are you doing here today? Looking for me specifically? Why?"

"Of course, I'm here to repay your spirit rice! I owed you so much spirit rice before; I always intended to return it," Old Huang said, taking out a pill from his person and tossing it to Ding Rui, who quickly caught it.

"This is a True Essence Pill, you should know, right? No matter if you don't, after all, you lost your memory once. Let me introduce it to you!"

"This True Essence Pill, one pill is worth five thousand grains of spirit rice. I only get five a month. This month, I used four for my own cultivation, and one is for you. This will repay half the principal. As for the remaining one hundred and ninety-nine pills, if I live long enough, I'll definitely return those to you too. Haha!" Old Huang suddenly laughed, as if amused by his own clumsy humor.

Ding Rui took the True Essence Pill in his hand, examining it closely for a moment. He marveled at how this longan-sized pill managed to compress the spiritual energy of over five thousand grains of spirit rice, then with a flick of his wrist, he tossed it back to Old Huang.

"Why doesn't the sect let us plant those Meridian-Opening Flowers now? Shouldn't confronting the enemy be the top priority?" Ding Rui asked, puzzled.

Old Huang shook his head, "You're thinking too simply. There's only a month until harvest. Planting Meridian-Opening Flowers now would mean wasting all the effort put into cultivating spirit grains over the past few months, completely abandoning this harvest. That would have an even greater impact on the sect."

"Moreover, the elders are currently holding the line outside, buying us time precisely so that this harvest can remain as unaffected as possible. Although the situation is dire, it's not *that* bad yet."

Ding Rui fell silent. He understood that his thinking had indeed been somewhat simplistic.

How many resources did just his single spirit field represent?

The entire Profound Talisman Sect had over five hundred spirit fields, how many resources did *they* represent?

Plus the entire sect domain!

"Oh right, I haven't asked yet, why were you, a spirit farmer, running around outside instead of staying properly in your spirit field? I only recently heard you became a spirit farmer, so I came to check on you while recovering from my injuries. I thought you were short on resources and busy as a fool, but it turns out you were out enjoying yourself, riding a spirit horse." Old Huang suddenly asked.

"Free and easy my ass." Ding Rui rolled his eyes, temporarily pushing the matter of the Wolf Cultivators to the back of his mind. He couldn't think of anything useful in the short term, and with his current strength, he could barely help with the situation.

"I just happened to plant some grain flowers; they matured, so I was going to exchange them for spirit rice," Ding Rui said, just about to tell Old Huang about his plans to learn alchemy, but Old Huang suddenly stood up.

Ding Rui did not accept Old Huang's True Essence Pill. Instead, he took Old Huang with him as they left the spirit field. Halfway there, the two parted ways. Old Huang had to go to the Battle Hall to continue recovering, as his injuries were indeed severe, while Ding Rui rode a spirit horse straight to the Logistics Department.

Just as Old Huang said, he no longer planned to plant grain flowers. He was going to plant Meridian-Opening Flowers!

This wasn't just for the sect's compensation, but also to make a contribution to the sect, one within his power!

Ding Rui felt that the sect domain was a good place, a place where he could feel at peace. So he genuinely didn't want to lose this place; instead, he hoped it would only get better!

However, if Ding Rui chose to cultivate Meridian-Opening Flowers, he wouldn't be able to practice alchemy.

Firstly, he would have to focus as much as possible on cultivating the Meridian-Opening Flowers and also see if there were any related skills he needed to comprehend.

Secondly, without his own cultivated grain flowers, he would lose a source of raw materials.
