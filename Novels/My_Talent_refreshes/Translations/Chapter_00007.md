# Chapter 7: Verdant Spring Technique

Cao Dongxin's expression darkened as he turned his face away. 

Chu Ning was pondering what might have been inappropriate about their conversation to cause such a reaction from Cao Dongxin when Qiu Shunyi, seemingly oblivious, asked in a hushed voice:

"Senior Brother, did we arrive too late? Senior Brother Cao came so early."

Shang Zhaoxiang chuckled at this, not looking at Qiu Shunyi but instead studying Chu Ning with interest as he explained:

"There's something you don't understand. Our Senior Brother Cao typically comes early for two or three months each year—whenever new disciples like you arrive. It's meant to be... training for you."

Understanding dawned on Chu Ning, and he found himself once again exasperated by Cao Dongxin's petty nature. However, he kept his expression neutral, feigning slight confusion instead.

Cao Dongxin glanced at Chu Ning before fixing Qiu Shunyi with an unfriendly stare. Realizing his misstep, Qiu Shunyi averted his gaze nervously and quickly changed the subject, turning to Chu Ning:

"Chu Ning, did you practice the Evergreen Wood Technique yesterday? Did you find it difficult?"

Chu Ning replied, "I only tried it once so far, so I can't really say if it's difficult."

At this, Qiu Shunyi's face fell. "I think it's quite hard. I practiced twice—once last night and again this morning—and I still haven't sensed any spiritual energy yet. I asked a few others earlier, and most are in the same boat. You've only tried once..."

His implication was clear—with just one attempt, Chu Ning must be even further behind. But remembering why Cao Dongxin had brought Chu Ning out so early, he quickly stopped himself.

"I'll take it slowly," Chu Ning responded simply, not elaborating further. He certainly couldn't reveal that he had already achieved Qi refinement and reached the first layer.

After exchanging a few more words, Shang Zhaoxiang and Qiu Shunyi didn't linger and soon moved to another field. Cao Dongxin finally rose from his seat and headed toward the crops.

Unsure of his intentions, Chu Ning began to follow until Cao Dongxin snapped without turning around, "Don't follow me. You'll disrupt my spellcasting."

"Understood," Chu Ning acknowledged, though he wondered what kind of spell would be needed in the fields. "Could it be the Verdant Spring Technique?"

He recalled the supplementary technique included at the end of the Evergreen Wood manual—a mandatory skill for all disciples in the Spiritual Plantation Division. Having just begun his cultivation journey the previous night, he hadn't yet had time to practice it.

From a distance, Chu Ning observed Cao Dongxin weaving hand seals over the fields. Quickly retrieving his manual, he flipped to the Verdant Spring Technique section and confirmed the gestures matched. Yet something felt off about Cao Dongxin's execution—the technique seemed unusually taxing, though Chu Ning couldn't pinpoint why he felt this way.

Unaware of Chu Ning's observations, Cao Dongxin completed the spellcasting across his designated fields despite the noticeable drain on his spiritual energy. Satisfied with his work, he took a brief rest before returning to Chu Ning.

"These fields are under my care," he said, indicating several plots. "Your duty is to guard them—scare away any birds that approach." His tone turned stern as he added, "Don't slack off. I won't tolerate any damage to the Scarlet Spirit Rice."

"Yes, Senior Brother," Chu Ning replied obediently, asking no further questions. Pleased by his compliance, Cao Dongxin's expression softened slightly before he departed for his quarters.

Once alone, Chu Ning moved to a corner of the recently enchanted field. Retrieving his manual again, he carefully studied the Verdant Spring Technique. After committing the essentials to memory, he faced a cluster of Scarlet Spirit Rice and began forming the hand seals.

Though his first attempt was clumsy, he successfully completed the sequence. Immediately, he sensed an almost imperceptible gathering of wood-attributed spiritual energy around three rice plants within the spell's range—so faint he might have missed it without the technique's guidance.

"This technique actually helps spiritual plants absorb energy," Chu Ning realized. "No wonder it promotes growth and enhances quality."

Checking his mental interface, he was surprised to find:

[Nine Yin Body Tempering Art (100/100)]
[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Grade Lower Tier), First Layer (1/300)]

"Why isn't the Verdant Spring Technique showing?" he wondered. The display remained unchanged from that morning despite his successful casting. 

"Perhaps it requires more practice?" he mused, though this contradicted his previous experiences with the other techniques, which had registered immediately upon initial study.

His attempt to cast again was thwarted by depleted energy reserves—a single Verdant Spring casting had exhausted the spiritual power cultivated overnight.

"Maybe I should practice the main technique here," he considered. The secluded field corner seemed safe enough, and his heightened awareness during cultivation would alert him to approaching people. Reasoning that sect territory should be secure, he sat cross-legged and began circulating the Evergreen Wood Technique.

Drawing upon yesterday's experience, Chu Ning quickly entered a meditative state. To his surprise, the ambient wood energy felt both richer and purer than before, allowing faster absorption. Attributing this to improved proficiency, he continued his practice.

Unbeknownst to him, subtle energy threads were emanating not just from the three plants he had enchanted, but from the entire section Cao Dongxin had treated earlier. These energies converged around Chu Ning's form, creating a denser spiritual atmosphere that accelerated his cultivation.

By the time distant voices signaled approaching workers, Chu Ning had made remarkable progress. 

"My cultivation today was exceptionally efficient—I've accumulated significantly more energy than last night," he noted, checking his status:

[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Grade Lower Tier), First Layer (3/300)]

The technique had advanced by two points—double yesterday's progress—despite a shorter practice session.
