# Chapter 99: Qi Qi

The tiny ladybugs were entirely composed of magical energy, not physical entities. No matter how fiercely the [Golden Wind] of the [Gold-Devouring Bee King] blew, it couldn't completely eradicate the swarm. For the first time, the [Gold-Devouring Bee King], which had always relied on numerical superiority, found itself outnumbered.

The [Gold-Devouring Bee King] urgently sent out signals, summoning all [Gold-Devouring Bees] back to the hive to join the battle. Seeing that the [Golden Wind] was ineffective, it immediately unleashed its newly acquired powerful ability—the [Pure Yang Heart Mantra]—to corrupt the swarming ladybugs.

Surprisingly, the mantra's magic had an extraordinary effect on the ladybugs. They fell like raindrops from the bee king's body, landing motionless on the ground with no sign of revival or reassembly.

"Hmm?" The Five Bamboo Sect's true disciple was taken aback. How could this mere second-tier venomous bee have the ability to corrupt the magical energy of her ladybug swarm?

She swiftly altered her combat strategy, unleashing another burst of magical energy. The small ladybugs began to converge and reassemble, their bodies rapidly expanding until they reached the size of millstones. In the blink of an eye, the room was filled with enormous ladybugs.

These giant ladybugs were far more formidable than their smaller counterparts. A few pinned down the [Gold-Devouring Bee King] while the others swarmed over it, each taking a bite until the bee king was devoured alive. Then, the giant ladybugs surged outward, attacking the worker bees in the same manner, consuming them in mere moments. Soon, the entire hive was completely wiped out.

The young woman then reverted to her human form and crouched to examine the ladybugs that had been affected by the [Pure Yang Heart Mantra]. The bee's magic was overwhelmingly potent, thoroughly corrupting her own magical energy beyond recovery.

This only fueled her anger further. She had intended to vent her frustrations on the bees, but instead, she suffered a loss in both magical energy and cultivation. Unacceptable!

Controlling the remaining ladybugs, she had them consume all the insect corpses on the ground, replenishing her depleted magical energy. Yet, her fury remained unquenched. She then commanded the giant ladybugs to tear the hive apart piece by piece.

Unbeknownst to her, at this very moment, nearly all the [Gold-Devouring Bee Hives]—centered around Hive No. 13—were mobilizing en masse toward her location. Twenty-two second-tier demon kings, leading thousands of first-tier worker bees, advanced with overwhelming momentum.

Pulling the strings from afar was a [Iron-Eating Beast] lagging far behind. In reality, Wu Bing, stationed in Iron-Eating City, had sensed the attack on the [Gold-Devouring Bee King] the moment it happened through the [Pure Yang Heart Mantra]. Bored from being cooped up in the city by Han Quan, Wu Bing finally had something exciting to do.

Having controlled so many [Gold-Devouring Bees] without ever using them in battle, Wu Bing saw this as the perfect opportunity for a large-scale combat exercise. Locking onto the enemy's position with its [Nose Divination], Wu Bing remotely directed the bee swarms to form a massive encirclement around the Five Bamboo Sect disciple, gradually tightening the noose to ensure no chance of escape.

Meanwhile, the young woman, who had transformed into a small ladybug mid-flight, seemed to sense something amiss. She reverted to human form and landed atop a metallic hill. To Wu Bing's surprise, she retrieved a bronze mirror, a set of table and chair, and a makeup box from her storage artifact. Right there in the desolate wilderness, she began applying makeup, removing the dust of her journey and adorning herself meticulously. She then donned a dazzling silver-embroidered headdress, transforming from a rustic maiden into an elegant and radiant figure.

After packing her belongings, she waited patiently. Before long, the first swarm of [Gold-Devouring Bees] arrived—over three hundred first-tier bees encircling their king, dominating a vast portion of the sky. The deafening hum of their wings reverberated through the air, yet the young woman remained unfazed.

One after another, more bee swarms arrived, gradually filling the sky around her. By the time all twenty-two swarms had assembled, the young woman calmly levitated into the air. Thousands of giant bees blotted out the sky, their collective drone drowning out all other sounds.

Wu Bing, though slower, had already closed the distance to within ten kilometers, eagerly directing the bees from what it deemed a safe distance. Thrilled by its first large-scale battle command, the bear couldn't resist shaking its plump rear in excitement.

At that moment, the young woman—as if sensing the enemy's full deployment—spoke up gracefully:

"Greetings, fellow cultivator. This humble one is Qi Qi, the fourth true disciple of the Five Bamboo Sect from Bamboo Continent. Newly arrived in your esteemed territory, I apologize for any disturbance. Might I inquire as to your name? Are you perhaps a fellow cultivator from the Inner Region sects?"

Qi Qi had been advised by her elders before coming to the Divine Thunder Palace's domain—local cultivators were known for their pride despite their modest means and were not easy to negotiate with. Yet, the bees remained silent, offering no response.

From afar, Wu Bing scratched its head, unsure how to respond. Part of it wanted to command the bees to swarm and capture the woman, but her polite demeanor gave it pause. Letting her go, however, was equally unappealing—not only had she destroyed one of its hives, but Wu Bing also fancied the idea of presenting this elegant woman to Han Quan as a maid, perhaps even having her groom its fur.

Unbeknownst to the bear, its hesitation played right into Qi Qi's hands. Seething with pent-up frustration and now realizing why she couldn't find a single drop of honey (these bees were the culprits!), she had been itching for a fight. Though she had initiated courtesy, she secretly hoped Wu Bing wouldn't back down—only a proper battle would satisfy her.

"Since the fellow cultivator refuses to speak," she declared, "let us settle this through combat—consider it an exchange of techniques!"

Her words were polite, but her actions were anything but. Her body dissolved like melting ice, transforming into a pool of crystalline liquid—which upon closer inspection consisted of countless microscopic ladybugs. These were Qi Qi's lifebound dao insects: the third-tier true gu, [Raindrop Pearls]!
