# Chapter 218: Refining Spirit Treasures

On a meditation cushion in the central area of the grand hall, Zhang Jing sat quietly, not uttering a word.

He had originally intended to wait until his master returned before finding an opportunity to request permission to go out and establish his own Dao field. After all, cultivating within the grotto-heaven no longer significantly impacted his current cultivation. Naturally, he had to start planning early.

Of course, there was another crucial reason: within the grotto-heaven, Zhang Jing always felt a sense of being constrained. He harbored many secrets, after all. And the Crimson Bright Grand Hao Grotto-heaven was his master's Dao field; he estimated that his master would be perfectly aware of even the slightest stir within it. As his realm grew higher, the risk of his Jade Talisman being exposed would increase exponentially. It wasn't that he feared his master's covetousness. Rather—Zhang Jing couldn't help but recall the identity test regarding the Xuanhuang Realm human race when he formally became his master's disciple in the Daoist Ancestral Court. Even now, he still felt a lingering fear. One had to know, the Jade Talisman had traversed with him.

Above, a gaze gently landed on Zhang Jing. Then, a voice filled with a hint of admiration sounded, directly breaking the silence in the grand hall.

"Zhang Jing, I remember the deadline I gave you was three hundred years. Now it seems, I underestimated you. In less than fifty years, you've actually cultivated the Way of World Derivation to the Golden Core Realm, and even—you've faintly surpassed the limits of the Way of World Derivation's legacy." Venerable Monarch Yuanming's face showed a bright smile. "Haha, very good."

Then he continued: "Since that is the case, I shall explain the three realms of Golden Core, Dharma Idol, and Dao Conjoining to you. Perhaps after listening, you will know how to proceed with your path."

As soon as the voice fell, Zhang Jing gratefully said, "Thank you, Master!"

In fact, just as his master had just said, Zhang Jing's current cultivation had clearly surpassed the limits recorded in the legacy of the Way of World Derivation. How to proceed in the Golden Core Realm, and even how to advance to the Dharma Idol Realm and even the Dao Conjoining Realm, had unconsciously become a huge stone weighing on his heart. Now that his master had proactively offered to explain the three realms, for Zhang Jing, it was undoubtedly like receiving a pillow when one was sleepy.

"This can't be a coincidence!" Zhang Jing's heart stirred, as if he understood something.

The next moment, Venerable Monarch Yuanming began: "The so-called Golden Core is nothing more than the materialization of various Dao intents and principles, a bridge for humans to communicate with the myriad Great Dao of the heavens. Divine abilities, they are methods that mimic the operation of heaven and earth's principles, thus able to draw upon the power of heaven and earth, possessing various miraculous abilities."

"From this realm onward, humans, relying on their Golden Core, can perceive and imitate the operation of the Heavenly Dao through divine abilities."

"However, such perception is ultimately superficial."

"The Dharma Idol Realm emerges in response!"

Venerable Monarch Yuanming's majestic Daoist voice resonated in his ears. Zhang Jing immediately cast aside all distracting thoughts, concentrating all his mind on listening to the Dao, not daring to miss a single word. As time passed, his perception of his surroundings began to fade little by little, until he finally fell into a chaotic state. In the depths of his mind, a sense of profound enlightenment naturally arose.

He didn't know how much time had passed.

"Dharma Idol casts the immortal body, Dao Conjoining condenses the immortal soul!"

"Within the human cultivation system, below the Dao Conjoining Realm, including the first three transformations of the Dao Conjoining Realm, is the process of allowing oneself to 'see' various Great Dao laws, and even to contain them within oneself."

"That is—I! See! Heaven! Earth!"

Zhang Jing suddenly opened his eyes, feeling that the last sentence was deafening, as if it encapsulated the essence of cultivation in one phrase! "I see Heaven and Earth! I see… Heaven and Earth!" He silently recited it over and over in his heart, his eyes growing brighter.

Finally, meeting Venerable Monarch Yuanming's gaze, which held a faint smile, Zhang Jing unconsciously stood up from the meditation cushion, then bowed deeply, his voice excited as he said: "Thank you, Master, for your guidance, this disciple is immensely grateful!"

Regarding how to proceed in the Golden Core Realm, at this moment, he already had an idea in his mind. Though not necessarily mature, at least he was no longer as lost as before.

"Good!" Seeing Zhang Jing's reaction, Venerable Monarch Yuanming couldn't help but nod in satisfaction.

"Disciple, there is a legacy in the third layer of the Daoist Scripture Secret Realm called 'The Essence of Grotto-heaven Ascension', written by Ancestor Yuan Yan of the Dao Sect. It meticulously records the Ancestor's various explorations into the Golden Core, Dharma Idol, and Dao Conjoining realms, delving deep into the essence of cultivation, making it exceptionally profound."

"I have already exchanged it for you."

"You can go to the Daoist Scripture Secret Realm to retrieve it when you have time."

"Thank you, Master." Zhang Jing forcibly suppressed the excitement in his heart and bowed again.

"Haha, I just said that here with me, there's no need for such formalities." Venerable Monarch Yuanming laughed heartily. Then he seemed to recall something and spoke again: "Right, there's another matter for which I summoned you this time. Five hundred years from now, the Dao Sect has quotas for 365 True Spirits, corresponding to the number of the Great Zhou Heaven, to descend upon the Great Cang World. This includes disciples of the Golden Core, Dharma Idol, and Dao Conjoining realms."

"I intend to reserve a spot for you, disciple. What is your intention?"

"The Great Cang World?" Zhang Jing asked, puzzled.

"Precisely." Venerable Monarch Yuanming nodded and immediately explained: "The Great Cang World is a vast world, currently entering a Grand Tribulation. Talented individuals emerge in droves, and fortunes contend for supremacy. Source Crystals, various Innate Divine Objects, and even Innate Spirit Treasures will appear endlessly."

"Once your True Spirits descend into this world and distinguish yourselves, becoming Sons of Fortune favored by its Heavenly Dao, you can instantly save tens of thousands of years of arduous cultivation."

"Moreover, if you can become the ultimate Son of Fortune, the Dao Sect and the Xuanhuang Realm will have additional rewards."

Speaking of this, Venerable Monarch Yuanming couldn't help but smile faintly. "Of course, that is the task for your Dao Conjoining realm senior brothers and sisters. As for you, disciple, your sole purpose in entering the Great Cang World this time is to seize as many innate resources as possible, and to comprehend various Innate Great Dao. A Grand Tribulation is a calamity, but also an opportunity!"

Upon hearing this, a hint of yearning suddenly flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. Source Crystals, Innate Divine Objects, even Innate Spirit Treasures? Any one of these things was something Zhang Jing could not refuse.

"Perhaps this journey to the Great Cang World will allow me to gather all the Innate Divine Objects needed to develop and evolve the thirty-six layers of the Taiyi Heavenly Constellation Deities' Innate Realms? And even allow me to choose among them? To thereby develop the most suitable thirty-six layers of Innate Realms?"

"This opportunity must not be missed!"

Zhang Jing's eyes showed a hint of determination. The only concern now was—True Spirit Descent?! He was still unclear about the risks involved. After all, his master had just mentioned that the Great Cang World was currently entering a Grand Tribulation. The dangers within were imaginable.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but look at Venerable Monarch Yuanming: "May I ask, Master, what is a True Spirit Descent?"

"A True Spirit Descent means that the Dao Sect will escort a wisp of your True Spirit, along with your memories, to descend upon an existing living being in the Great Cang World. If you unfortunately perish in the Great Cang World, your True Spirit will return to the Dao Sect, carrying the gains from the Great Cang World." Venerable Monarch Yuanming said with a smile.

So that's how it is? A flash of understanding suddenly appeared in Zhang Jing's eyes. Then he looked up at his master and responded decisively: "This disciple is willing to participate!"

"Good! Then go back and prepare well. It's best if you can reach the Dharma Idol Realm before your True Spirit descends into the Great Cang World. The higher your cultivation, the deeper your understanding of Dao principles and laws will be. Thus… your gains in the Great Cang World will be even more considerable."

"Thank you for the reminder, Master, this disciple will remember. By the way, Master, I—" As if remembering something, Zhang Jing hesitated, looking as if he found it difficult to speak.

Seeing this, Venerable Monarch Yuanming's smile grew even gentler, and he reminded him again: "With me, you need not be reserved."

Zhang Jing took a deep breath, then mustered his courage and said: "This disciple wishes to leave the grotto-heaven in the near future and choose a spiritual land in the Clear Sky Profound Bright Heaven to establish a Dao field. I hope Master will grant permission."

"Establish a Dao field? That's good too." Upon hearing Zhang Jing's request, Venerable Monarch Yuanming nodded with a look of understanding.

The next moment, he continued: "Since you have this idea, disciple, then go. If you choose a location, you only need to communicate directly with the Flowing Light Immortal Realm. And if you find it difficult to find a spiritual land, you can also have your senior brothers and sisters assist you." Venerable Monarch Yuanming earnestly instructed.

"Thank you, Master, this disciple remembers."

…

Time passed bit by bit. Beside the spiritual spring in the center of the immortal island, the deer Thirty-Eight, with a large head and small body, was watering the many immortal roots and spiritual plants, including the Three-Light Flat Peach Tree, with spiritual liquid. He hummed a tune he had learned at the Welcome Immortal Banquet earlier, seeming exceptionally joyful.

Not far from him, Zhang Jing sat on a bamboo chair, his eyes fixed on the jade slip in his hand, his divine sense entirely concentrated on it. Every moment, massive amounts of information flooded into his mind, then transformed into a part of Zhang Jing's profound foundation. The fusion of various Dao intents, the transformation of the Dao foundation, the forging of the Divine Ability Golden Core, the construction of myriad Dharma Idols, the various transformations and tribulations of Dao Conjoining… Though it was just a small jade slip, the information recorded within it was as vast as the sea, so much that an ordinary cultivator might not be able to finish reading it even if they spent their entire life. It practically dissected and revealed the most essential aspects of the Golden Core, Dharma Idol, and Dao Conjoining realms.

After a long while, his gaze gently moved away from the jade slip in his hand. *Hoo—* Zhang Jing let out a soft breath. "The 'Essence of Grotto-heaven Ascension' is truly a priceless treasure, both for an individual and for a faction. Heh heh, it's good to have a master."

Then, as if remembering something, a streak of light flashed, and Zhang Jing's figure instantly vanished from his original spot.

…

In the cultivation chamber.

"Since I've decided to leave the grotto-heaven and find a spiritual land, I should make the necessary preparations. Those immortal treasures and spirit treasures, now that I've advanced to the Golden Core Realm, I can finally refine some of them."

"Right, the Grand Supreme Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade also needs to be cultivated." A flicker of anticipation flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

A bronze immortal chain, an inch long, and a small black flag, only palm-sized, quietly appeared in his hand. The bronze immortal chain was a gift from Senior Brother Feng Wuyu when he first entered the Crimson Bright Grand Hao Grotto-heaven, named the Immortal Binding Chain. It still bore traces of immortal blood and possessed terrifying power. After gathering dust in Zhang Jing's hands for nearly fifty years, it finally saw the light of day. As for the black flag, its origin was even more significant. It was called the Profound Nether Black Water Banner, a low-grade Post-Heaven Spirit Treasure. It was given to him by Martial Uncle Ming You True Monarch, one of the twelve Heavenly Immortal True Monarchs, when he was in the Daoist Ancestral Court.

…

…

Cultivation knew no years. Nine years passed in a flash.

In the cultivation chamber, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, and his aura instantly surged by a significant margin. With a thought, *Clang clang—* the sound of clashing metal immediately rang out, and then a bronze chain, exuding a terrifying aura of suppression and sealing, emerged like a spiritual snake from behind Zhang Jing. In an instant, under the shroud of this suppressing and sealing aura, the immortal spiritual energy within the palace was immediately completely confined, and the air directly transformed into copper walls and iron barriers.

"What a treasure!" A trace of pleasant surprise flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. This Immortal Binding Chain truly lived up to its name as a terrifying immortal treasure gifted by Senior Brother Feng Wuyu. Even though he could only refine a mere trace of it currently, it displayed extremely terrifying power.

However… powerful might also meant terrifying consumption of magical power. Only because Zhang Jing's innate divine ability, the thirty-six layers of the Taiyi Heavenly Constellation Deities' Innate Realms, with its Void Furnace in the thirty-six heavens, continuously refined the void, providing him with massive amounts of magical power every moment, could he barely sustain it.

"Once the first layer of the Innate Realm is fully developed and evolved, with a small world as a backing, I should be able to easily activate this Immortal Binding Chain." Zhang Jing thought to himself.

Time slowly passed. Three days later, Zhang Jing called over Deer Thirty-Eight.

"Thirty-Eight, go pack up. Your master and I are leaving the grotto-heaven to explore the Eastern Pole Continent below." As he spoke, he couldn't help but recall Senior Brother Feng Wuyu's previous instructions. After some thought, Zhang Jing finally decided it would be better for him to take Deer Thirty-Eight and explore. Resting for too long leads to restlessness. This journey would serve as a change in cultivation method. Moreover, it had been so many years since he arrived at the Clear Sky Profound Bright Heaven, and he hadn't properly witnessed the grand sights of the Heavenly Realm, which was truly inappropriate.
