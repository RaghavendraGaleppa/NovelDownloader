# Chapter 654: Celestial Thunder Jade Purity, Nine Firmaments Profound Vault!

This time, he would burn his boats and fight to the death!

Xu Yunfan turned his head, looking in the direction of the South Continent.

On the South Continent, within the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, at the Celestial Balance Peak.

Deep within a cave dwelling, Han Shi sat cross-legged. Sword Qi raged around him like furious waves and raging tides, as the Thousand Chariots Geng Sea Furious Wave Sword Art was pushed to its absolute limit.

His eyes were bloodshot, and surging waves of intense hatred for Xu Yunfan churned in his chest. It was this ultimate fury that fueled his Rage-Killing Sword Intent, making it increasingly fierce and vast. He was using this very emotion to temper his Rage-Killing Sword Intent.

"Xu Yunfan... once my Sword Dao is perfected, I will surely ensure you are body and soul annihilated, and I will reclaim my freedom!"

Han Shi roared inwardly. His Sword Core hummed, and a mighty aura, one that seemed to yearn for the Dao Fruit's favor, began to brew in the depths of his Sea of Consciousness.

His talent in the Sword Dao was unparalleled. In just a few short decades, his cultivation had already reached the perfection of the Foundation Establishment realm.

The Chariot-Bearing Sword Throne he had cultivated himself was also a rare sight. Within the Foundation Establishment realm of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, he was arguably the number one!

However, at this critical juncture.

An irresistible, sovereign will surged from the depths of his heart like a flood, instantly piercing through all his mental defenses and swiftly taking control of every inch of his flesh and every single thought.

The hatred on Han Shi's face froze instantly, replaced by endless shock and disbelief.

"Little Han, all these years, you've suffered. You've been obsessed with hating me day and night."

Xu Yunfan's calm voice, like a celestial edict, sounded directly at the very depths of Han Shi's soul, devoid of any emotional fluctuation.

Han Shi was horrified. His soul struggled violently, but it was as if he were frozen in primordial ice that had existed for ten thousand years, his very thoughts becoming sluggish.

Fear and terror filled his heart. He finally realized that he had never escaped Xu Yunfan's control.

Why would Xu Yunfan dare to let him cultivate within the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, even allowing him to reach the perfection of Foundation Establishment?

The avatar, which had been refined from him using the Cloud Satchel Avatar Art, had never been truly severed. He remained a puppet, completely under control.

The Sword Dao talent he was so proud of, the true meaning of Rage-Killing he had painstakingly comprehended—all of it was nothing but a joke in the face of Xu Yunfan's absolute control via his Attribute Panel.

"You... what do you want to do?"

Han Shi's last remaining consciousness sent out a weak and desperate question within the flood of Xu Yunfan's will.

Xu Yunfan did not respond.

He manipulated Han Shi's body to stand up and took a single step out of the cave dwelling.

The light of the outside world fell upon him. The face of Han Shi (Xu Yunfan) no longer held any of Han Shi's emotions, only a cold indifference.

He looked up towards the sky above the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, a sky that had been fragmented by countless sharp sword intents.

*Boom!*

A boundless Rage-Killing Sword Intent surged into the heavens without reservation. It was even more violent and pure than when Han Shi himself had used it, carrying a fury that had been forcibly elevated to its absolute peak.

In the Purple Mansion Sea of Consciousness, the phantom of the Chariot-Bearing Sword Throne, which represented Han Shi's lifelong comprehension of the Sword Dao, trembled violently. Furious waves churned upon it, and the sharpness of Geng Metal tore through the space of his Sea of Consciousness.

Seeing this, Han Shi was even more terrified. He had never imagined that the Rage-Killing Sword Intent Xu Yunfan displayed would be even superior to his own.

Xu Yunfan naturally sensed Han Shi's emotions.

What a joke.

With his Attribute Panel in hand, the Rage-Killing Sword Intent was already recorded in the Skills column. If he couldn't even unleash this level of power with the help of the Attribute Panel, then how could he ever hope to scheme for the Golden Core?

"You just watch and see. This is how the Rage-Killing Sword Intent is truly used."

Xu Yunfan said, and then directly retracted Han Shi's soul into the Star Spirit Banner.

A Sword Soul refined by such a sword intent was a rare treasure and could not be wasted.

"Thousand Chariots Furious Sea, Geng Metal returns to the Void, all transformations are annihilated! Manifest!"

Xu Yunfan, borrowing Han Shi's mouth, let out a Dao cry that shook heaven and earth. This voice contained Xu Yunfan's own understanding of the Sword Dao, and through the Attribute Panel's perfect deduction and optimization of the Rage-Killing Sword Intent, it instantly resonated with a corresponding Dao Fruit in the ether.

Deep within the heavens of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World, a grand, profound, and boundless will, filled with the aura of destruction and return to the void, was suddenly stirred. It was like an endless abyss of return to the void, hidden deep within the Nine Nethers, devouring all waters. It emanated a pressure that made the countless sword cultivators of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect tremble, yet also filled them with ultimate temptation.

The Cangming Return to the Void Dao Fruit!

This was one of the seventy-two Earthly Fiend Dao Fruits within the one hundred and eight Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Dao Fruits of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World, ranking among the foremost of the Earthly Fiend.

Whoever held it would command all waters, able to transform furious waves into swords, and bring all things to annihilation and return to the void. It was a top-tier Dao Fruit even within the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

The gaze of the Dao Fruit's favor instantly locked onto the figure on the Celestial Balance Peak of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect who had stirred the furious sea and raging waves sword intent.

Han Shi.

An invisible opportunity for proving the Dao began to slowly descend and then rapidly spread throughout the heavens and earth.

The entire Taihua Spirit Ruin World was shaken.

Naturally, this aura was felt.

Someone was seeking the Golden Core and proving a Dao Fruit position!

In an unknown corner, a low mutter was heard.

"A hothead in this day and age?"

After all, the Taihua Spirit Ruin World was dominated by numerous Golden Core True Lords. The path of ascension was sealed, and those who dared to prove the Dao and form a Golden Core would basically all die a miserable death.

Almost in the same instant that Han Shi (Xu Yunfan) stirred the Cangming Dao Fruit, ten thousand miles away, in the Eastern Wasteland of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World.

At the ritual site for guiding a Dao Fruit established by the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land in the Eastern Wasteland.

Under a Bodhi Sacred Tree shrouded in seven-colored glazed Buddha light, a grand "Self-Royalty Buddha" fruit-acceptance ritual was reaching its most critical stage.

Buddhist chants shook the sky, lotuses of Buddhism covered the ground, and the combined power of countless high monks, great virtuous ones, and guardian Vajras formed a golden torrent. This torrent supported a nascent, brilliant Buddhist fruit, which emitted immeasurable light, immeasurable life, and immeasurable wisdom, as it slowly rose, attempting to fully merge with the heavenly Dao laws of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World.

Bodhisattva Huiri sat cross-legged on a lotus throne, his majestic appearance solemn. His vast Buddhist power enveloped the entire area, suppressing all external demons and ensuring the smooth progress of the ritual.

Although the official guidance had not yet begun, the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land was already preparing. As long as an opportunity arose, they could guide it in an instant. And that opportunity was to take advantage of the moment when the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect had their attention diverted. According to Bodhisattva Huiri's calculations, this opportunity would soon arrive, and the terrestrial Buddhist kingdom was imminent.

However, at this moment when ten thousand Buddhas paid homage and the aura was condensed to its peak...

*Crack!*

Without any warning, a purple-gold thundercloud covering half of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land materialized out of thin air. Within the thundercloud, it was not ordinary lightning, but countless divine thunder bolts of the Celestial Thunder interwoven into runes of destruction. At the core of the runes, a vague yet magnificent image was materializing, radiating an aura that could shatter all laws and bear the immortal essence of all heavens.

Xu Yunfan's main body had, at some unknown time, stealthily arrived at the ruins of a collapsed mountain range at the edge of the ritual site. He no longer suppressed his aura. Ninety-nine strands of immortal golden nature swirled within his nascent洞天 like ninety-nine roaring purple-gold dragons. The Celestial Thunder Nine Firmaments Profound Vault Immortal Sutra was pushed to an unprecedented extreme.

"Celestial Thunder Jade Purity, Nine Firmaments Profound Vault! The枢机 of all transformations, Thunder proves me!"

Xu Yunfan's voice was not loud, but it was like a divine edict from the God of Thunder in the nine heavens, piercing through the endless Buddhist chants and clearly imprinting itself upon the laws of heaven and earth.

What he was stirring was none other than one of the top ten Heavenly Gang Dao Fruits among the one hundred and eight Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Dao Fruits of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World.

The Celestial Thunder Jade Purity Nine Firmaments Profound Vault All Transformations Immortal Dao Fruit
