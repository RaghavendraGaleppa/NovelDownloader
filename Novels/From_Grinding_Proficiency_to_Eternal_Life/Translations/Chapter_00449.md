# Chapter 449: Cultivation Knows No Seasons

Sensing this, Xu Yunfan suddenly recalled the Five Elements True Person he had killed in the Divine Martial Realm.

No wonder that fellow was so arrogant.

With the circulation of Five Elements Qi, a cave heaven naturally forms, laying a先天 (先天, innate) foundation.

"Lin!"

A Dao shout exploded like thunder.

The instant Xu Yunfan formed the Lin Seal, the boiling True Wu Law Power around him froze as if sealed, his blood energy retracted inward, and his pupils glowed with jade light, as if transcending the mundane world.

Supreme Dispassion.

It was an unparalleled secret technique of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. If not for Yu Congling being a direct disciple of the sword sect, he would not have been able to cultivate such a marvelous method.

The moment he entered the Lin state.

Pine needles on the rock platform hung suspended in mid-air, and the Gang wind transformed into patterns; time seemed to nearly stagnate at this moment.

His Spiritual Sense was like a mirror, reflecting the meridians and hundreds of bones. The circulation of Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil energies, and the minute flaws in the Law Power's cycle, were all clearly visible.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan seemed to reside in a crevice of time, scrutinizing himself with his Spiritual Sense with incredible precision.

The Heavenly Gang energy descending from the Hundred Meetings acupoint and the Earthly Evil energy rising from the Yongquan acupoint formed a perfect balance under the regulation of the Lin Seal. Even the most minute dissipation of Law Power was completely prevented.

With the Lin Character Art successfully cultivated, his entire body was reflected, and everything was clear in his heart.

This technique was a secret transmission of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, with "Supreme Dispassion" as its core. Cultivated to the depths, the spirit condenses and the will silences, and all things stagnate.

Under the Lin state, the efficiency of cultivation was simply逆天 (逆天, heaven-defying).

What would take an ordinary cultivator several days to harmonize the conflicts of spiritual energy, for Xu Yunfan, was but a single thought.

The clear and ethereal Heavenly Gang descended from the Hundred Meetings, while the thick and heavy Earthly Evil rose from the Yongquan. Under the command of the Lin Seal, the two stimulated and clashed with each other, yet not a single wisp dissipated. Every strand of Law Power was precisely refined into True Wu Law Power.

The patterns of the Turtle and Snake Divine Form gradually became distinct, resonating with the stars of the Big Dipper. The starlight tempered his body, allowing his cultivation to advance, gradually moving towards the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.

Even more marvelous was the realm of "Dispassion."

All seven emotions and six desires were retracted, leaving only a pure Dao Heart. Deducing cultivation techniques and comprehending secret arts was as easy as dismembering a carcass with a butcher's knife.

The difficulty of fusing the clouds in "Xuandu Eight Scenes Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Scroll," and the danger of Heavenly Thunder tempering in "Green Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method," were all easily resolved in a state of no emotion and no thought.

Occasionally, there would be backlash, but with a turn of the Lin Seal, the blood energy would immediately calm, and injuries would fully recover.

Although this state could not be maintained for long, every time he cultivated in it, it was as if he had undergone a hundred days of bitter cultivation. The progress in the Divine Martial Dao Foundation and the technique of grafting a cave heaven surged rapidly because of it.

No wonder when Yu Congling saw him use the Lin Character Art to deal with an enemy back then, she couldn't help but pop out and say a sentence.

"The Lin Character is not a technique for killing, but truly a key to knocking on the Dao."

Now Xu Yunfan deeply agreed. Only by cultivating in this state can one live up to the true essence of Supreme Dispassion.

Only under such a state of mind can one reflect all things, turn heaven and earth into oneself, and use everything as fuel.

Suddenly, thunderclouds came from the East Sea. Xu Yunfan, neither sad nor joyous, actively cast a spell to draw them to the summit of True Wu Mountain.

Using the Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method, his mind soul left his body and soared into the air, transforming into a three-foot green blade that pierced into the clouds.

This was the essential cultivation technique of the "Green Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method," drawing Heavenly Thunder to temper the mind soul.

只见 (只见, It could be seen that) the lightning flashed like dragons and snakes roaming. He used the Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune to guide it, and the power of the Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl also took effect. Every bolt of lightning that struck down instantly transformed into tiny golden serpents that charged at him to baptize and temper him. Every time a bolt of lightning fell, his soul would become more resilient, and even the range of his Spiritual Sense's reflection would continuously expand.

Such a secret method for soul cultivation, even within the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, was a top-tier inheritance among ten thousand.

The "Green Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method" used Heavenly Thunder to temper the soul, making the Spiritual Sense as sharp as golden silk, with its reflection range continuously expanding. It could even trigger the phenomenon of a Thunder transforming into a Green Dragon.

Such a marvelous method, if not for being a direct disciple of the True Lord Qingyuan, an ordinary cultivator, even if they spent a hundred years of bitter cultivation, might not be able to glimpse the threshold.

The True Lord Qingyuan indeed did not spare any effort in nurturing his subordinates.

He not only bestowed the "Cave Heaven Grafting Technique," a secret transmission involving the Three Realms' tides, but now he had also obtained this Thunder Method for soul tempering.

The accumulation of various opportunities showed that the True Lord placed great hopes in him, wanting him to guard the Cold Raven Pass, and also to gain the upper hand in the Three Realms' game.

He indeed had the intention of cultivating his own person.

In the Lin state, Xu Yunfan instantly analyzed the pros and cons.

It was worth it!

Having a big tree to shelter from the rain was convenient.

Three days and nights later, while cultivating the Green Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method, a dragon's roar suddenly sounded around Xu Yunfan's soul. It was the sign of the "Thunder Transformation into Green Dragon" reaching minor success.

'Your Green Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method has reached Minor Success.'

Xu Yunfan glanced at a piece of information that popped up on his vision, then quickly exited the Lin state.

Now his mind soul was powerful, but it still took half a day to leave the Supreme Dispassion state before he felt the divinity within him recede, and his human form once again occupied his body.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let out a breath.

His heart moved slightly, and he took out the Ten Thousand Souls Banner. With a gentle infusion of Law Power, amidst the roiling black mist on the banner surface, the soul shadow of Yu Congling suddenly appeared.

The moment she appeared, this direct disciple of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect had a sharp, killing intent in her eyes. The sword energy around her soul body surged, as if she wanted to slice Xu Yunfan into a thousand pieces.

But the next instant, the restrictions of the Ten Thousand Souls Banner made her entire sword intent converge, and she forcibly lowered her head.

She sneered, "What? A dignified Divine Martial Foundation Establishment cultivator, has his Dao Heart been反噬 (反噬, counterattacked/backlashed) by Supreme Dispassion?"

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged, only saying淡淡 (淡淡, faintly/calmly), "After the Lin state, the divinity is hard to dissipate. Is there a solution?"

Yu Congling heard this and scoffed, "Do you think Supreme Dispassion is an ordinary mind-calming incantation? This technique uses dispassion to prove the Great Dao. The deeper you cultivate, the thinner your humanity becomes. This is the path the Sword Sect's founder took when creating this secret technique."

She originally didn't want to answer further, but under the restraint of the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, her soul body flickered between light and darkness. Finally, she couldn't bear it anymore and said word by word, "Only if your mind soul is as strong as iron can you control dispassion!"

Seeing Xu Yunfan frown, since she had already spoken her mind, she dropped all pretense and her tone softened slightly: "If you can't even withstand this minor backlash, you might as well disperse the Lin Seal early."

Yu Congling pointed to her own chest, "When I first mastered the Lin Character Art back then, I went into seclusion in the Lin state for half a year. The day I came out, I couldn't even remember my Master's face..."

Before she could finish, the sound of chains clanging suddenly came from inside the banner.

Yu Congling let out a muffled groan as her soul body was forcibly pulled back into the banner, leaving only her final warning drifting in the wind: "Either resist with your willpower, or... wait to become a mindless, desireless cultivation puppet!"

She let out a light laugh from her mouth, "I would be very happy to see the latter."

Xu Yunfan stared at the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, a golden light surging in the depths of his eyes.

Three days without a beating, and you're climbing up the roof to tear off the tiles. Once I have the time to sort things out, I'll make sure you know that the Hundred Desires Peak isn't just about physical states; there are also scenes of spiritual and physical fusion.

After obtaining the key information, Xu Yunfan wasn't too worried.

Since that's the case, let's see whether Supreme Dispassion will erode his humanity first, or whether he will use this dispassionate Dao fire to temper a Dao heart that is eternal and indestructible first!

Xu Yunfan silently glanced at the attribute panel on his vision. As long as he maxes out the special effects of the Lin Character Art, this method will definitely be resolved, so there's no need to worry too much.

The most mentally exhausting was "Xuandu Eight Scenes Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Scroll."
