# Chapter 14: Passing the Assessment! Off to the Inheritance Pavilion! (Combined)

Was it just his imagination?

Zhang Jing felt the jade talisman before him seemed slightly more substantial than before. Though the change was minuscule, he'd still noticed it.

"Could it be because I've reached the initial stage of the visualization technique and awakened my spiritual sense?" Zhang Jing mused, his gaze sharpening.

After all, that was the only change that had occurred within him during this period.

His eyes drifted downward to the newly leveled-up [Pure Origin Breath Visualization Technique], where a line of small characters danced energetically, demanding attention.

[Skill Trait: Gathering Origin Spirit Light (Low Grade)]

Information suddenly surfaced in his mind:

[The dantian generates a Gathering Origin Spirit Light that collects qi, refines essence, purifies spiritual energy, and significantly increases the speed of spiritual energy refinement.]

"Dantian spirit light that gathers qi and refines essence?"

Zhang Jing unconsciously pressed a hand to his chest, his breathing quickening.

The Pure Origin Breath Visualization Technique made it clear:

Awakening spiritual sense through initial mastery of the visualization technique was merely a prerequisite for cultivation.

The true cultivation phase involved absorbing spiritual energy into the body, refining it into spiritual power, thereby initiating the terrifying transformation from mortal to immortal.

This was the origin of the first cultivation realm—the Qi Refinement Stage.

In qi refinement cultivation, the most crucial aspects were the speed of spiritual energy refinement and the purity of spiritual power within the dantian.

The former determined cultivation speed, while the latter affected the difficulty of breaking through cultivation bottlenecks.

Coincidentally, the [Gathering Origin Spirit Light] enhanced both.

With excitement, Zhang Jing closed his eyes and directed his spiritual sense toward his dantian.

Within the empty dantian space, a faint glow was discernible. At its center, a spirit light coiled like a small serpent, exuding an aura of vitality and purity.

"It really is in the dantian!"

After confirming this, Zhang Jing returned his consciousness to the present.

His gaze fixed intently on the jade talisman.

A new anticipation stirred within him.

If the level one [Pure Origin Breath Visualization Technique] had already granted the [Gathering Origin Spirit Light] trait, what new traits might appear when he raised it to level four?

Or level seven?

Or even—the ultimate evolution into a Dao Seed!

Speaking of Dao Seeds...

At the thought of Dao Seeds, Zhang Jing realized that his recent breakthrough had also enhanced his mental state. This meant he should now be able to sustain the Heart's Eye Dao Seed for longer.

A glance outside revealed the darkening sky.

There was still time.

"Heart's Eye!" Zhang Jing commanded inwardly.

Instantly, the Dao Seed in his consciousness sea blazed with light, activating the Heart's Eye.

His comprehension ability surged dramatically, his thoughts accelerating.

Simultaneously, his newly awakened spiritual sense began to dwindle, as if being consumed by something.

"Activating the Dao Seed consumes spiritual sense now? That makes sense—spiritual sense is a product of mental refinement. Perhaps the Dao Seed always required it, but I lacked spiritual sense before."

Wait, if that's the case...

Zhang Jing directed his consciousness inward.

The Heart's Eye Dao Seed was voraciously devouring his meager spiritual sense.

He attempted to control both his spiritual sense and the Dao Seed simultaneously.

Less! Slower!

Immediately, the enhancement from the Heart's Eye diminished, but in exchange, the consumption of spiritual sense decreased significantly, prolonging the duration of the Heart's Eye state.

"Much better!"

Zhang Jing nodded in satisfaction.

This state was more suitable for prolonged cultivation. Slow and steady wins the race—it wouldn't do to collapse exhausted after just a few breaths every time.

It would also damage his reputation.

"Perhaps the Dark Python Devours Emptiness Dao Rhythm has changed too?" Zhang Jing speculated.

He was tempted to test it immediately.

But a glance at the time changed his mind.

Never mind—first priority was to find Instructor Wang and secure his Class B evaluation.

"Excellent, you've awakened your spiritual sense. Deng An—mastered the visualization technique on the sixth day, Class B evaluation, to be reported to the Academy's Inspection Pavilion."

"Congratulations, Junior Brother Deng," Instructor Wang said cheerfully. "You've passed the assessment and may enter the academy!"

"Many thanks for your guidance, Senior Brother Instructor."

A soft knock interrupted them.

The conversation halted abruptly.

"Enter," Instructor Wang called out, his rugged face showing puzzlement—who could be visiting at this hour?

"Instructor, perhaps someone has encountered difficulties in their cultivation and seeks your advice," Deng An suggested mildly.

"Perhaps," Instructor Wang mused.

The door opened slowly.

"Oh, it's you, Brother Zhang!" Deng An exclaimed in surprise upon recognizing the newcomer.

"Brother Deng is here too?"

Zhang Jing paused momentarily, surprised to encounter Deng An, but quickly recovered.

His impression of this person was faint—among Ji Bochang's group of four, Deng An had been the most low-key, showing neither peaks nor valleys, almost invisible.

Yet unexpectedly, he'd been the second to pass the assessment after Ji Bochang.

"Yes, I had some matters to discuss with the instructor."

Deng An studied Ji Bochang's friend before him, replying amiably.

Meanwhile, Instructor Wang fell into thought before speaking:

"You're Zhang Jing, correct? What brings you—"

Before he could finish, Instructor Wang's eyes suddenly sharpened, locking onto Zhang Jing's forehead in disbelief.

"Spiritual sense? You've mastered the visualization technique?"

Zhang Jing nodded.

Silence.

Instructor Wang was speechless.

After a long pause:

"Wonderful! Zhang Jing, I never expected you to master the visualization technique in just six days! What a delightful surprise! Hahaha~"

Instructor Wang burst into laughter, vigorously patting Zhang Jing's shoulder.

He hadn't imagined that among the candidates he was overseeing in the Seventh Provisional Academy, aside from those from cultivation families, someone could master the visualization technique within seven days to earn a Class B evaluation!

Wait—

Instructor Wang suddenly recalled Zhang Jing lived in the free stone hut.

Meaning—he came from an ordinary background with no prior exposure to cultivation knowledge.

"What remarkable talent!" he marveled inwardly.

Having been an ordinary candidate himself, Instructor Wang understood just how exceptional this youth's aptitude was—second only to those monstrous talents who earned Class A evaluations.

And how many such monsters existed?

He promptly produced a jade slip, recording Zhang Jing's name and the time taken to master the visualization technique.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, congratulations on passing the assessment and joining the academy!"

"Your information has been reported to the Academy's Inspection Pavilion. Tomorrow, a senior brother will escort you to the Inheritance Pavilion to select a mid-grade inheritance."

When mentioning mid-grade inheritances, Instructor Wang's tone carried a hint of envy.

"Junior... junior brother?"

Zhang Jing's eyes widened as he stared at Instructor Wang, wondering if he'd misheard.

"Brother Zhang, aside from the academy head and pavilion elders, all academy members address each other as senior and junior brothers," Deng An explained, stepping forward.

His gaze at Zhang Jing still held traces of astonishment and complex emotions.

And admiration for Ji Bochang—how had that guy's judgment been so sharp?

This was like finding a high-grade spirit stone in a pile of dung—and he'd actually succeeded!

"I see. Thank you for clarifying, Brother Deng."

Zhang Jing quickly adapted, mimicking Deng An's manner as he addressed Instructor Wang:

"Many thanks for your guidance, Senior Brother. Zhang Jing is deeply grateful."

"Haha, no need for formalities, junior brother," Instructor Wang waved heartily.

Then, as if remembering something, he added kindly: "Junior Brother Zhang, when selecting a mid-grade inheritance tomorrow, be sure to choose a cultivation method with high compatibility. This is fundamental to your cultivation."

"Senior Brother, don't we already have the [Pure Origin Breath Visualization Technique]?" Zhang Jing asked, puzzled.

"Ahem, junior brother, that's merely the most basic cultivation method. Its efficiency can't compare to graded cultivation methods. If you wish to enter the inner academy, you can't rely on basic methods to advance your cultivation."

"There are age and cultivation requirements for entering the inner academy!"

Instructor Wang said meaningfully.

Inner academy?!

Zhang Jing's heart shook.

"I understand now. Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother."

"Haha, no need for thanks, junior brother. Even if I hadn't mentioned it, the senior brothers at the Inheritance Pavilion would have reminded you. I'm just currying favor in advance."

Instructor Wang chuckled.

"Even so, your advice comes from kindness. This kindness, Zhang Jing will remember."

Touched by Zhang Jing's sincerity, Instructor Wang's expression turned solemn:

"Junior Brother Zhang, you're quite the character. This humble brother resides at North Lake's Three Woods Island. Should you encounter difficulties, seek me out. Within my capabilities, I'll assist."

"Thank you, Senior Brother~"

Nearby, Deng An watched with envy.

"Alright, junior brothers, return and prepare. Once you leave the Seventh Provisional Academy, you won't return."

"Understood, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing and Deng An replied in unison.

"Off you go then—I won't see you out."

With a wave of Instructor Wang's hand, the distant door swung open silently.

Creak—

Zhang Jing pushed open the stone hut's small door, luggage on his back, and stepped out.

He couldn't help glancing back, emotions swirling.

Though he'd only spent a few days here, this small stone hut held special significance as where his cultivation journey began.

Surveying its weathered surfaces, he wondered:

How many had this hut witnessed embarking on the immortal path since its creation?

Had others before him stood here like this?

He couldn't be certain—after all, this was just a free stone hut.

The next moment, he turned and headed toward Instructor Wang in the distance.

"Haha, Junior Brother Zhang, feeling reluctant to leave?" Instructor Wang teased.

"Senior Brother sees right through me," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.

"Perhaps this place will become extraordinary because of you—who can say?" Instructor Wang's gaze turned profound. "Hurry along now—the senior brother fetching you has arrived."

"Senior Brother, you've said that line many times before!"

"Haha, you noticed?"

Instructor Wang rubbed his nose awkwardly before leading Zhang Jing toward the square beside the lecture hall.

Along the way, Zhang Jing's luggage-laden figure drew many curious glances.

Yet when those gazes encountered Instructor Wang ahead, they quickly retreated.

Various thoughts sprouted in observers' minds:

"Is he leaving already?"

"What's happening? Can candidates withdraw this early? Isn't it too soon to give up?"

Some understood better.

In one stone hut, a voice exclaimed: "How... is... this... possible?!"

In another, a chubby youth stared mournfully at the retreating figure, his heart aching with each sway of the luggage.

He'd recognized Zhang Jing immediately.

He'd advised against giving up.

"Sigh, cultivation is truly difficult—I can't see any hope. Will I end up quitting like him?"

The chubby youth sighed, his face forming a 'wry' expression.

At the square, a green-robed man had been waiting.

Beside him stood Deng An, posture straight, face expectant.

Meanwhile, in the detached courtyard area opposite:

Two people stared fixedly at Deng An, their moods contrasting sharply.

Wu Mingyuan's eyes burned with envy, resentful it wasn't him standing there; Chu Lingyun's gaze held both envy and eager anticipation.

She'd just mastered the visualization technique—though slightly later than Deng An, it still earned her a Class B evaluation.

As the third in the Seventh Provisional Academy to pass, she'd be standing there tomorrow!

Time flowed onward.

'Where's Instructor Wang? Why haven't they left yet?' Wu Mingyuan and Chu Lingyun wondered simultaneously.

Just then, Instructor Wang and Zhang Jing appeared in their view, approaching the green-robed man.

Both pairs of eyes froze in shock.

They understood perfectly what this meant.

Understanding was one thing—acceptance another.

Especially since it was—Zhang Jing!

"He passed before me? Impossible!" Chu Lingyun gasped, her pretty face stunned.

After recovering, she murmured: "So deep—he hid it so well. Ji Bochang must have known—probably to mock me."

Then she recalled her promise to Ji Bochang and felt a flicker of excitement.

"Since Brother Zhang earned Class B, I'll honor my word—after the assessment, I'll invite him to join us."

As for Wu Mingyuan:

"I must be dreaming," he muttered, face ashen.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing?"

The green-robed man smiled at the approaching pair, his tone confident.

"Zhang Jing greets Senior Brother. May I know how to address you?" Zhang Jing replied evenly.

"I'm surnamed Lu—address me as Senior Brother Lu."

"Understood, Senior Brother Lu."

Nodding, Senior Brother Lu turned to Instructor Wang, chiding:

"Junior Brother Wang, yesterday you complained about poor results, yet today produces two Class B talents! You're not being honest!"

"Haha, just luck, Senior Brother Lu—pure luck!" Instructor Wang grinned.

"Keep pretending! With these three, your Seventh Provisional Academy ranks among the top six of thirteen... Enough talk—I'll take these junior brothers to the Inheritance Pavilion now."

With that, Senior Brother Lu flicked his sleeve, releasing a palm-sized green jade boat that expanded swiftly in the wind.
