# Chapter 421: Does Our Sect Need a Supreme Elder?

The sunlight was just right.

Under the banyan tree in the Autumn Water Pavilion, the crisp clattering of mahjong tiles echoed.

"How much are we playing for?"

"Hmm? Playing for money? Sect rules prohibit gambling. Last time, Master, you were caught."

Li Mo's expression turned serious. As everyone knew, he was a gentleman and had nothing to do with gambling or drugs.

Shang Wu's lips curled slightly. "Who usually comes to the Autumn Water Pavilion? It's rare to play mahjong with my precious disciple. What's the fun in playing without stakes? Hehe..."

"..."

Why did the beautiful Master's laugh suddenly sound so sinister?

Qin Yuzhi wore the same sinister smile as Shang Wu while explaining the rules to Ying Bing. Li Mo only understood the basics, so he listened along.

It seemed somewhat similar to Sichuan Mahjong from his previous life.

When one person won the round, the other three could continue playing until the remaining three all won or the tiles were exhausted.

So, winning first didn't necessarily mean earning the most.

Ying Bing nodded after listening and said softly, "I've never played before. I'm not very good."

"Me neither." Li Mo hadn't quite grasped the rules yet and was a bit dazed.

"It's fine. You already understand the rules. Playing mahjong is all about luck. Beginners usually have great luck."

"Exactly. How complicated can mahjong be?"

Shang Wu and Qin Yuzhi exchanged a glance, seeing the insidious smiles in each other's eyes.

*How could mahjong be so simple?*

They were going to drain him dry!

Today, they had to teach the wealthy young Master Li a lesson.

"I think I... won?"

Ying Bing pushed her tiles out uncertainly, a hint of hesitation in her clear, cool eyes.

*Heavenly Hand, Pure Straight.*

Qin Yuzhi: "!"

This must be an accident!

Her supreme, peerless skills hadn't even had a chance to be used yet!

"?"

Shang Wu looked at the "ice lump" with suspicion. Could there really be someone at the table with better luck than her?

Impossible. Absolutely impossible!

"Sigh..."

Li Mo hadn't won this round and had paid the most.

Although Shang Wu and Qin Yuzhi had won, their hands weren't big, so all three had to pay up.

The ice lump was the sole winner.

"Pay up, pay up."

Li Mo took out the silver. Even though he had lost money, he still had a smile on his face.

"It's just luck," Qin Yuzhi said, refusing to believe it.

Shang Wu painfully fished some silver from her purse and said expressionlessly, "Continue."

And so.

After five rounds, the atmosphere gradually became tense. Every round, the ice lump won first, Shang Wu second, Qin Yuzhi third, and Li Mo came in last.

"Tch... This is weird."

Li Mo picked up another hand, which was a colorful, chaotic mess, like a home wrecked by a husky.

He didn't seem to be the type to win money at mahjong...

This time, both Shang Wu and Qin Yuzhi had delighted expressions. Their starting hands were clearly excellent, and they exchanged a glance, forming a clear alliance.

The ice lump remained expressionless, her eyes cold and clear.

"Heh heh."

Qin Yuzhi smoothly arranged her mahjong tiles. "I'm not trying to prove how strong I am, but I will take back what I've lost!"

It was clear she had a huge hand this time.

Shang Wu tilted her lips. "Little Bing'er, can you one-shot me? Can you one-shot the Mahjong Goddess of the Clear Abyss Sect? I'll immediately..."

"Gang!" Young Master Li finally got a bit of participation.

A Gang meant immediate payment.

Then, a fair, cool, jade-like hand took that One Bam, and then gently pushed the tiles.

"Robbing the Gang, is this how it's done?"

*Crash!*

The Mahjong Goddess of the Clear Abyss Sect and the Mahjong Tyrant of the Summoning Demon Cult were struck as if by lightning, slumping back into their chairs, their faces turning pale!

"Do you even know how to play?! She was just one tile away, and you Ganged?!" Qin Yuzhi clenched her fists.

"I told you I don't know," Li Mo said with a blank expression.

"Little Bing'er, you said you don't know how to play mahjong!"

---

Shang Wu gritted her teeth and took out her last piece of silver.

"I really don't know," Ying Bing tilted her head slightly.

"Impossible, absolutely impossible!"

"I just learned it. It should be a bit simpler than martial arts and Go, so I learned it quickly."

"..."

Shang Wu and Qin Yuzhi were speechless for a moment, unable to refute.

They turned their heads and saw Li Mo laughing happily, his嘴角 harder to suppress than an AK.

"What the hell are you laughing for? You didn't win a single hand, kept giving tiles to Little Bing'er, and you're still smiling even though you lost the most!" Shang Wu said angrily.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and glanced at Li Mo, noticing that all the silver he had just taken out was gone.

She then reached out with her fair hand, gathered all the silver she had just won, and put it all in front of him.

"Here."

"!"

Li Mo was stunned. The AK-like smile on his face gradually twisted into a Gatling gun spewing blue fire.

"??"

Qin Yuzhi and Shang Wu exchanged a glance, sitting up straight in shock from their near-death state.

Something's wrong. It feels like we've been tricked!

Li Mo lost the most, but Little Bing'er won more than he lost. If you add their winnings together, they were still winning. So, all the money came from the two of them.

Are you two running a husband-and-wife scam here?!

"No more, no more. We're out of money."

Shang Wu pushed the mahjong tiles away.

Li Mo glanced at the ice lump. Playing mahjong today was, as Qin Yuzhi said, to prevent that... *formidable existence* from awakening.

They had only played for a bit, so he didn't know if it was effective...

"Master, you're out of money, but I have some."

"Hmm? Are you going to treat your Master? How embarrassing..." Shang Wu's eyes lit up as she sat back down.

"If you're embarrassed, then let's use a different method."

Li Mo smiled shyly:

"Care to hear about Mahjong Loans?"

"?"

At that moment, the game had yet to restart.

The door to the Autumn Water Pavilion was suddenly flung open.

Shang Wu looked and saw the Sect Master, Elder Han He, and several people from the Hengyun Sword City.

Shang Wenchang was stunned when he saw the mahjong table.

Elder Han He was filled with suspicion.

And the people from the Hengyun Sword City, seeing the Divine Hammer Little Tyrant sitting there counting silver, unharmed, looked as if they had seen a ghost in broad daylight.

Elder Zeng looked at the single hair in his hand, then at him:

"Li Mo, you... are you human or ghost?"

"Naturally not a ghost. How could a ghost play mahjong?"

Li Mo felt both moved and amused upon seeing them.

Before they could shift from fear to confusion, Li Mo joked:

"Naturally, I'm a *Ba* (a type of zombie), hehehe..."

"Demon, taste my sword!!"

"Wait, I was joking."

Luckily, Li Mo explained quickly, or he would have had to catch the blade with his bare hands.

"What on earth is going on?"

Elder Han He finally let out a sigh of relief, but was still confused.

Shang Wenchang laughed dryly. "Martial artists should have a calm heart. To be so easily startled—what is that like?"

"Little Mo, tell us slowly."

Li Mo and Ying Bing had repelled the Great Shang remnant army in the Southern Frontier and killed the high-ranking members of the Summoning Demon Cult.

They even took turns slapping the face of the Great Yu Crown Prince.

The Sect Master had already been shocked into self-reflection. For geniuses like these two, how could their growth not experience great storms and waves?

As their elders, they needed to be calm and not be easily startled.

Li Mo glanced at Qin Yuzhi and said:

"Elders, I brought the Summoning Demon Cult Master out. She's temporarily considered my employee."

"?"

"She's writing her resume right now. Does our sect... need a Supreme Elder?"

"????"

...

PS: My relatives came back, so it's a bit late. Sorry about that.
