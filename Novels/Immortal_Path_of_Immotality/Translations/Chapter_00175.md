# Chapter 174: Partners Turn Against Each Other

The eastern sky began to lighten with the first hints of dawn as a gentle morning breeze swept across the land.

The Gongsun family estate lay in ruins—collapsed walls and charred earth stretched as far as the eye could see, with wisps of smoke still rising from the scorched ground. The once-beautiful landscape gardens had vanished without a trace, leaving only devastation in their wake.

The Great Sun True Fire hadn't been extinguished—it had simply burned out after consuming everything combustible in its path. Like a gang of ruthless bandits, the flames had completely annihilated the thousand-year-old aristocratic family, leaving not even a feather behind.

The clan leader and the Grand Elder, both Golden Core cultivators, stood dumbfounded on a patch of scorched earth, surveying the destruction with hollow eyes. They had spent the entire night in a state of helpless despair.

After being injured by the minor divine ability last night, the two had immediately tried to fight the fire, only to realize their efforts were futile.

The Great Sun True Fire could burn anything. Even a Golden Core cultivator would struggle to extinguish a single flame, and with countless fire nets interconnected throughout the area, every flame they put out was instantly replaced by another. Their frantic efforts to contain the blaze were utterly useless.

After a night of futile struggle, they could only watch as their magnificent Gongsun family estate was reduced to ashes.

The herb gardens, artifact forges, alchemy workshops, scripture pavilions, treasure vaults, cultivation chambers, ancestral halls—all gone.

This damn divine ability was insidiously vicious. It had started quietly, spreading unnoticed until it became an unstoppable inferno that indiscriminately consumed everything. How could a large-scale offensive divine ability also possess stealth properties?

By the time they realized what was happening and tried to salvage what they could, everything flammable was already ablaze. In the end, they only managed to rescue a pile of ancestral tablets—ironically the most useless items of all.

As for the spiritual herbs, grains, alchemy production lines, and artifact forging facilities—all reduced to ashes!

The treasure vault, which housed the family's vast collection of spirit stones, had suffered the worst fate. When the Great Sun True Fire reached it, the massive influx of spiritual energy triggered a series of earth-shaking explosions that even affected the Qianyun Pavilion's Elder Mang, who had been maintaining the teleportation formation nearby.

Originally, Elder Mang's teleportation formation was located near the cemetery, where there weren't many flammable materials. But who could have predicted it would be right next to the underground treasure vault? The explosion of countless spirit stones combined with the Great Sun True Fire unleashed a force comparable to another minor divine ability.

The result was catastrophic—the formation had been halfway activated when the explosion struck. The righteous faction's reinforcements from the western regions were already in transit through the teleportation channel when the exit portal was violently destroyed. The sudden imbalance in spatial pressure between the two ends of the teleportation array caused the channel to collapse, unleashing spatial turbulence...

The righteous faction's reinforcements were completely wiped out!

When Elder Mang, caught completely off guard, crawled out of the rubble severely injured, his heart turned to ice as he saw the half-destroyed teleportation formation before him.

The entire Qingyang Peak contingent from Qianyun Pavilion—including the peak master, four Golden Core elders, over forty Foundation Establishment deacons, and hundreds of inner sect disciples—had all perished!

Because of his failure to properly receive them, the reinforcements were gone!

But the question was—what had he done wrong?

Who was he? Where was he? Where had he come from? Where was he going?

How had everything gone so terribly wrong?

Elder Mang had been completely focused on maintaining the teleportation formation and had no idea what was happening outside. But that didn't change the grim reality he now faced.

Once the sect learned that the entire reinforcement force for Shangdang Prefecture had been lost—an entire peak's lineage wiped out because of him—how could he possibly atone for such a crime?

The loss of four Golden Core elders was catastrophic enough, but they also represented an entire lineage within Qianyun Pavilion's inner sect. The Qingyang Peak's entire legacy had been severed in one fell swoop!

Who could possibly bear responsibility for the destruction of an ancestral lineage? Not even the sect leader could escape punishment for such a failure—he would have to commit suicide to atone!

As for those wild tales about people surviving spatial turbulence—about there being a one-in-a-million chance of survival—that was pure nonsense. Even a child of destiny would be unlikely to survive such an ordeal.

No one would believe such odds, especially not the Nascent Soul elders of the sect. There were only a handful of such cases recorded in the entire history of the cultivation world—it was utterly absurd.

Since there was no way to explain this disaster, and he would inevitably be held accountable by the sect, should he simply defect?

That wasn't a realistic option either.

Righteous cultivators weren't like demonic cultivators—few were loners. Everyone had disciples, family, and close friends. If he fled, what would happen to his dao companion? His descendants? His disciples? His closest friends? Most importantly—what would happen to his Dao Heart?

Abandoning the sect that had raised him since childhood and betraying all his loved ones would inevitably give rise to inner demons. Over time, these demons would grow stronger, devouring his cultivation essence until he succumbed to qi deviation and died.

It was an inescapable dead end!

Elder Mang stumbled out of the ruins like a walking corpse, already foreseeing his miserable fate. Just last night, he had been full of hope for the future. Now, at dawn, his prospects lay in ruins. The extreme shift from joy to despair left him in a state of numb emptiness.

As for the two Golden Core elders of the Gongsun family and their surviving clansmen, when they saw Elder Mang emerge, their previous respect was gone—replaced by barely concealed hatred in their eyes.

The Gongsun family had stood firm in the cultivation world for over a thousand years, quietly developing without causing trouble. Yet they had been caught in the crossfire between the righteous and demonic factions. When immortals fight, mortals suffer—why should their family bear the brunt of this calamity?

As for your teleportation formation being disrupted—serves you right!

Neither the righteous nor demonic factions are any good—they're all beasts who devour people without spitting out the bones. They all deserve to die.

Of course, their greatest hatred was reserved for the leader of the demonic envoy group—that seemingly harmless young man.

To brazenly use such a vicious large-scale divine ability within the Gongsun family estate was utterly despicable. Truly the work of a sewer rat bred by the demonic sect—twisted, perverted, cruel, and inhuman!

If curses could kill, Lin Shan would have died a thousand deaths by now.

As for who started this conflict, it hardly mattered anymore. Whether the demonic faction came first or the righteous faction followed, the Gongsun family's vacillation and their subsequent pursuit of Lin Shan to prevent his escape—it was all a tangled mess.

Everyone had acted for their own faction or family—there was no clear right or wrong.

From their own perspective, they could only blame fate.

Of course, the grudge had been firmly established. Whether they would have a chance for revenge in the future would depend on what destiny had in store.

...

Meanwhile, the instigators of this disaster—the demonic envoy group that had simultaneously destroyed both the Gongsun family and the righteous reinforcements—had long since fled thousands of miles away.

With the demonic faction's frontline collapsing and their defeat now irreversible, the righteous army had begun deep penetration operations. Combined with the encirclement and pursuit by dozens of defecting forces and airborne troops, the eastern heartland of the Great Song Dynasty had become a perilous place where every step was fraught with danger.

It was broad daylight, with clear skies stretching over plains and low hills. Flying would make them too conspicuous, easily spotted from a distance. Using the Cloud-Dropping Banner to disguise themselves as a cloud would slow them to a crawl.

After some discussion, they decided to travel on foot during the day.

Lin Shan summoned the "Puppet Chariot"—this magical artifact was quite fast on land. With the entire team channeling their spiritual energy to power it, the two puppet warhorses snorted and galloped at impressive speed.

Since there were no pursuers yet, they needed to cover as much ground as possible before the righteous army fully reclaimed the Great Song territory. Once the coastlines were secured with an impenetrable net, escaping back to the Eastern Sea would become nearly impossible.

As they traveled, the group couldn't help but reminisce about last night's thrilling events.

After showering Lin Shan with praise for his brilliant leadership and strategic genius, they also commended the dutiful Black Skeleton Demon Lord for maintaining the formation.

No one mentioned how the two had nearly abandoned them to save themselves—such behavior was tacitly understood. Helping others when possible was a kindness, but when survival was at stake, everyone would prioritize their own life. As demonic cultivators, they viewed this pragmatically.

In fact, from another perspective, both Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord could be considered "exemplary" leaders in the demonic path. They hadn't fled at the first sign of danger and had instead led the entire team to safety—wasn't that the very model of "demonic role models"?

However, one strange incident from last night couldn't be so easily overlooked now that everyone had calmed down.

Namely, Old Man Zhong's slap.

That seemingly divine intervention had nearly sent the Black Skeleton Demon Lord flying!

Who could tolerate such humiliation?

Moreover, after the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's critical contributions last night, its standing with Lin Shan and the group had risen significantly, giving it more confidence to speak up. Combined with the skeleton's inherently vengeful nature—even back in the Hell World, it had been notoriously petty.

Hadn't it gone to great lengths to exact revenge on the Three-Headed Hellhound across multiple worlds?

As for why a being at the Nascent Soul level could be so petty and lacking in dignity—well, it was just a skeleton monster. Human standards of behavior didn't apply.

Now, as they traveled, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord seized the opportunity to make its displeasure known, its jaw clacking ominously:

"This Demon Lord seems to recall someone slapping me last night?"

The group's cheerful chatter immediately died down, everyone lowering their heads in unison. Lin Shan pretended to gaze at the sky.

Old Man Zhong, who was driving the chariot up front, stiffened, feeling invisible daggers stabbing into his back.

"What's wrong? Daring to act but not admit it?" The Black Skeleton Demon Lord's sinister voice carried clear implications.

Old Man Zhong continued to play the shrinking violet, not daring to make a sound, though his eyes darted about nervously as he surveyed the passing scenery.

"That slap was truly miraculous—to send this Demon Lord reeling is no small feat. How very strange..."

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord was still probing. As a Demon Lord from the Fifth Hell World's Skeleton Demon Ridge, its rise from an ordinary skeleton to its current status had been built on caution and wariness. The reason it hadn't retaliated immediately was that the incident seemed suspicious.

A mere Qi Refining old man managing to slap away a Foundation Establishment skeleton was beyond absurd—it defied all logic!

But after observing Old Man Zhong all night, it found him unchanged—still scrambling desperately during their escape, still flattering Lin Shan with the same fervor. That genuine sleaziness couldn't be faked.

It had even secretly used several detection techniques to scrutinize Old Man Zhong multiple times, confirming he wasn't "hiding his strength"—he was genuinely just a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator with no concealed power. This only deepened its confusion.

The cunning skeleton then privately urged Lin Shan, as the nominal leader, to investigate further.

To its surprise, Lin Shan not only dismissed the matter but openly mocked its wounded pride:

"What's the big deal about a slap? When you first arrived at the Turtle Sage's cave, didn't I slap you too?"

"That was different! I had no power back then—now I'm at Foundation Establishment!"

"So what if you're at Foundation Establishment? Look at you—your bones rattle with every step, you're constantly clutching your ribs to keep them from falling off. Who couldn't knock you over in that state?"

"I—you—" The Black Skeleton Demon Lord's jaw worked soundlessly, unable to refute this. Skeleton monsters were famously fragile, prone to falling apart at the slightest provocation—common knowledge in the cultivation world.

But I'm no ordinary skeleton monster! My true form is a Nascent Soul Demon Lord!

Lin Shan scoffed, refusing to entertain such excuses. Weak was weak—without the support of artifact-forging masters and formation experts, plus all the magical equipment it had armed itself with, it couldn't win a fistfight against anyone.

You're not some special variant like a Blood Jade Skeleton, Black Diamond Skeleton, Jade Marrow Skeleton, or Purple Poison Skeleton—just a run-of-the-mill skeleton monster!

What's so unbelievable about getting slapped by surprise?

Of course, Lin Shan's real thoughts were different:

I don't care if Old Man Zhong is hiding his strength—if he is, all the better for our safety! Why would I expose him? And if he isn't, he's still my loyal subordinate. Why would I punish one underling to appease another?

That's right—in Lin Shan's mind, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord was just another employee, no different from Old Man Zhong. At least Old Man Zhong was openly loyal, while this skeleton constantly coveted his Primordial Spirit Treasure. Naturally, he'd show some favoritism.

But the Black Skeleton Demon Lord refused to accept this. Feeling grievously wronged and receiving no support from Lin Shan, it decided to take matters into its own hands.

Hence the current confrontation.

"Everyone, be the judge—last night, I dutifully maintained the formation exit, ensuring our safe escape. Our survival was entirely thanks to me—"

Lin Shan shot it a dangerous look.

"—Alright, perhaps not entirely, but at least I contributed significantly! Yet this is how a hero is treated—assaulted by his own comrades! Where is the justice?"

The absurdity of a skeleton monster appealing to justice wasn't lost on the group—as demonic cultivators who believed in "controlling their own destiny," why would they care about heavenly principles?

But as its complaints grew increasingly exaggerated, Old Man Zhong, who was driving the chariot, finally couldn't take it anymore and turned to argue:

"This old man merely gave Your Excellency a light tap in the heat of the moment—how can you call it assault?"

Seeing the old man finally respond, and having been "reasoned with" by Lin Shan's twisted logic—plus its own failed attempts to detect anything unusual—the Black Skeleton Demon Lord decided to drop all pretense.

"A light tap? That was no light tap! You nearly extinguished my soul fire with that slap—you were trying to kill me!"

"Nonsense! How could a mere Qi Refining cultivator like me threaten a Foundation Establishment expert like you?"

"I was there—I felt the power of that slap firsthand. Who would know better than me?"

"Words are wind—this old man respects you as a Demon Lord, but I won't tolerate baseless accusations."

"Fine! Since you refuse to see reason, let's settle this fairly—you slap me once, I slap you once, and we're even!"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord bared its fangs at last. As a Nascent Soul entity, being struck by a Qi Refining ant was an unprecedented humiliation. Unless one had experienced it personally, they couldn't comprehend its rage.

Having never suffered such indignity in its long existence, it was determined to restore its dignity.

With its Foundation Establishment clone's full strength behind a deliberate strike, it could surely send this old man flying into next week!

But the moment these words left its mouth, the entire group reacted with alarm.

If the Black Skeleton Demon Lord really unleashed a full-powered slap, Old Man Zhong would be killed instantly—how could a Qi Refining cultivator withstand a Foundation Establishment attack?

They immediately began urging restraint:

"Your Excellency, please, let it go—why lower yourself to his level?"

"Calm down—it was a moment of panic. He wasn't in his right mind."

"Indeed, indeed! A great man like you should be magnanimous—just let this small matter pass."

"Look how remorseful he is—give him a chance to redeem himself!"

...

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord glanced at Old Man Zhong, who wore a stubborn expression with a hint of mocking amusement—hardly the picture of remorse described by the others. Its anger flared anew.

"Don't try to stop me! An eye for an eye—this debt must be repaid today!"

But the group, having fought alongside Old Man Zhong for over a decade in the demonic-righteous war, shared bonds forged in battle. They couldn't stand by and watch him be brutalized.

They rushed to restrain the Black Skeleton Demon Lord—some grabbing its legs, others wrapping around its waist, a few clinging to its arms, while others stood protectively in front of Old Man Zhong.

"Your Excellency, don't act rashly! We're all on the same side—no infighting!"

"The path ahead is fraught with danger—we must stand united!"

"The righteous faction has set traps everywhere—don't give them the satisfaction of seeing us fight!"

"Save this minor grievance for after we return to the Eastern Sea!"

"Think of the big picture!"

"Yes, the big picture!"

"The big picture matters most!"

...

What fucking "big picture"!

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord was livid!

It finally understood the saying, "No one can truly understand another's pain." In that moment, it felt like an avatar of vengeance, its hellish instincts stirring with murderous intent.

"Killing a mere Qi Refining old man won't affect our plans! And I'm only returning his slap—not taking his life!"

But the group remained unmoved. That "slap" would be no different from a death sentence. Given Old Man Zhong's frail appearance, he probably didn't have many years left anyway—a beating like that would surely send him to the underworld.

Seeing the situation escalating, Lin Shan decided it was time to intervene before things got out of hand.

"Enough! In my view, Brother Black Skeleton has indeed suffered greatly. After working tirelessly to maintain the formation exit last night, being struck by one of our own is understandably infuriating..."

As Lin Shan spoke, the group stopped restraining the skeleton, whose soul fire brightened with anticipation of justice.

But then Lin Shan shifted focus, pointing at Old Man Zhong and appealing to sentiment.

"Old Man Zhong acted without malice last night. Moreover, he's always handled all logistical matters for us—after so many years of service, he's certainly earned some goodwill..."

The group nodded in agreement. Old Man Zhong perked up, hopeful.

Lin Shan felt slightly uneasy—while he had some leadership skills, balancing these dynamics was tricky.

"But the Black Skeleton Demon Lord has also contributed greatly—whether at the Burial Poison Valley camp or during the Bianliang campaign, it's fought alongside everyone. Last night, it risked its life to open an escape route for all of us—loyal and dependable..."

This statement made even Lin Shan cringe. The group averted their eyes awkwardly, Old Man Zhong blushed at the "loyal and dependable" description, and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord itself dimmed its soul fire in shame.

Sensing the awkward atmosphere, Lin Shan pressed on:

"Old Man Zhong is also an invaluable administrator—he excelled at spreading our teachings in the Eastern Sea and even provided the Bloodthirsty Gu when I was in danger, saving my life in a way..."

Old Man Zhong puffed out his chest proudly, which only inflamed the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's fury.

Finally, with the group's intervention and Lin Shan's mediation, last night's incident was "temporarily set aside," with everyone whispering the same four words to the Black Skeleton Demon Lord:

"Think of the big picture."

For a moment, the skeleton nearly succumbed to its demonic nature, wanting to slaughter everyone and part ways with Lin Shan. But the thought of the Primordial Spirit Treasure it hadn't yet obtained from the "foolish boy" reined in its impulses.

For the treasure... I'll endure!

Thus, the once-compatible partnership between the Black Skeleton Demon Lord and Old Man Zhong turned frosty overnight, leaving Lin Shan and the group caught awkwardly in the middle.

...

After two days and nights of nonstop travel eastward, they finally crossed into Qingzhou territory at dusk.

But their frantic escape came to an abrupt halt as they gazed at the spectacular celestial phenomena ahead.

In the distance, clouds churned and mist billowed, with vast oceans of spiritual energy rolling under the sunset's glow. Four figures flickered amidst the clouds, their movements like thunderbolts, each gesture unleashing world-shaking power whose aftershocks extended dozens of miles.

This was clearly a battle between Nascent Soul experts!

Three of the figures radiated purple light, surrounded by thunder dragons and silver lightning serpents—undoubtedly elders from the Violet Thunder Sect.

The fourth combatant was a young man in his twenties. Astonishingly, despite being only at Golden Core cultivation, he was holding his own against three Violet Thunder Sect elders—an unbelievable feat.

But as distant roars reached them, the truth became clear.

"Damn demonic scum! What have you done to Lei Yinzi's soul?"

"Fellow Daoist, as a Dharma King True Monarch, possessing a junior's body is beneath your status! Aren't you ashamed of tarnishing the Black Lotus Sect's reputation?"

"Monster! To think I treated you as my most cherished disciple all these years, only for you to be an imposter..."

...

"Hahaha! You three old fools are as stubborn as ever! After spending years infiltrating the Violet Thunder Sect, I even considered joining properly since I'd taken over one of your disciples.

But you'd rather have your mediocre Golden Core disciple back than gain a Nascent Soul expert—how shortsighted!

Though I must say, the original owner of this body—Lei Yinzi—lived up to his reputation as one of your sect's two Nascent Soul seeds. Dual A-grade spiritual roots combined with a Crimson Silver Body—truly exceptional. Reaching late Nascent Soul stage again no longer seems impossible.

Hahaha!"

...

Amidst their battle, the combatants traded verbal barbs without restraint, their voices booming across hundreds of miles.

Lin Shan and his group were stunned to realize the crimson-robed youth holding his own against three opponents was none other than the Black Lotus Sect's pillar—the Dharma King, a late Nascent Soul expert!

This was the same legendary figure who, during the Violet Thunder Sect's cataclysmic battle years ago, had abandoned his physical form during a heavenly tribulation, his Nascent Soul fleeing into obscurity. Many had assumed he perished—yet here he was!
