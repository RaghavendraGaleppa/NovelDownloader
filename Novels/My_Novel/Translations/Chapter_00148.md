# Chapter 148: Human Yet Not Human, Infinite Possibilities

Early August, the summer heat had begun to fade.

In the Commandery Courtyard.

\[You consumed the essence meat of the Golden Blooded Red Carp, Proficiency +69\]

The essence meat entered his stomach, a refreshing sensation spreading throughout his body. It transformed into the essence of heaven and earth, first swirling in his abdomen. Enhanced by his skill consumption, the essence became even more concentrated, splitting into over a hundred strands.

Li Xian had washed his fetal phase clean, having already shed the mud胎. The essence of heaven and earth was a "snob"—it fought to escape when he was in the mud胎, afraid to stay even a fraction of a second longer.

Now that his fetal body was pure, the essence no longer hurried to leave. It darted back and forth like a mischievous child, "touring the garden" everywhere.

Li Xian circulated his Qi through the meridians, stabilized his blood, and sealed his pores, doing his best to retain the essence. However, the essence of heaven and earth was unrestrained; after playing to its heart's content, it dispersed on its own.

Only twenty or so strands remained in his abdomen.

Shoulders draped in neon clouds, chest rumbling like thunder... His physical body approached the realm of nature, and various divine phenomena gradually manifested.

Vanishing without transforming is called "Shoulders Draped in Neon Clouds."

Vanishing and transforming is called "Head Giving Birth to Life Hair."

With the passage of time, it happens naturally. Heaven rewards the diligent; as long as one is willing to endure hardship, there is nothing in this world that cannot be achieved.

With Li Xian's persistent efforts and the assistance of his wife, the essence in his abdomen finally lingered for a long time. At this moment, he finally managed to transform a portion of it.

A gentle breeze blew.

His hair fluttered, and he felt as if his soul had ridden the wind, rising straight to the heavens beyond the ninth cloud. He felt the wonder of the heavens and earth, containing infinite charm.

Breaking through an invisible shackle.

Among his thick hair, a tiny strand of fine hair emerged. This was the "Life Hair," which, to a certain extent, represented the lifespan of a martial artist.

Li Xian's physical body had undergone a year of tempering: from being poorly clad and poorly fed, to circulating Qi through the meridians and stabilizing blood, and then to successfully washing the胎 and revealing the相.

He passed through重重关隘, step by step. Finally, he grasped a sliver of the ability to digest the essence of heaven and earth.

With this step taken.

From now on, he could seek longevity and pursue various divine phenomena.

Martial artists drink the essence of heaven and consume the精华 of earth. Increasing martial prowess is one aspect; extending lifespan is the second.

For every inch the Life Hair grows, one's lifespan increases by a寸.

"The road ahead is long and arduous. I now have all four characteristics. From now on, when I consume \[Essence Treasures\], I can increase my lifespan, truly vanishing and transforming!"

Li Xian was filled with excitement, gently stroking the white strand of hair. It pulsed with vitality, distinct from that of an ordinary person.

An ordinary person possesses only a mud胎. If they suffer a fatal injury, there is no chance of survival. A martial artist who consumes essence is different. Although they still have two hands, two legs, and a head, their body approaches the nature of the heavens and earth, adding infinite possibilities.

Even if their heart is shattered.

As long as there is a divine doctor's assistance, combined with heavenly treasures, they can be saved. An ordinary person with a mud胎, however, can never be saved no matter what.

Xu Liefeng's blood vessels were corroded; logically, he should have died. Yet he was able to save himself and escape danger. The credit for this, aside from the miraculous effect of the treasure, lies in the divine phenomena brought by the "Essence Consuming" realm.

Essence Consuming martial artists possess more possibilities.

Li Xian's experience was still shallow and needed further contemplation. He thought, "In the end, the Essence Consuming realm uses the essence of heaven and earth to create one's own inner world."

\[You have entered 'Essence Consuming, Shedding Mortality'\]
\[Essence Consuming, Shedding Mortality\]
\[Proficiency: 1/100\]
\[Description: The First Realm of the Martial Path. The long road of shedding mortality begins with this first step. Enduring all hardships and coldness is for this very moment. Ten steps form a level, and each level reveals a difference.\]

\[You pounded your chest and shook your body, Proficiency +2\]
\[Iron Copper Art\]
\[Proficiency: 269/1500 (Minor Completion)\]

In the Martial Commandery Hall.

Li Xian slapped his chest, his body shaking as he practiced the "Iron Copper Art." Having entered the "Essence Consuming" realm, his martial arts gained new qualities. When he held his breath and activated the "Iron Copper Body," a dark luster erupted from beneath his skin.

Before Essence Consuming... Li Xian had pushed his martial arts to the limit, faintly manifesting phenomena and adding imposing momentum.

After Essence Consuming, infinite possibilities were added. If his martial arts attainments were deep, he could do more than just manifest phenomena—he could "turn the illusory into reality."

Although he had gone through washing the胎, shedding the胎, and revealing the相... in the end, Li Xian was still "mortal," merely possessing the qualification for transformation.

At noon, Li Xian was in high spirits. His martial path had advanced further, and he became even more diligent in his training.

Suddenly, a "clinking" sound rang out by his ear. Though the sound was light, it was very distinct. It echoed in his mind, lingering for a long time.

The Martial Commandery Hall was located by the street.

Usually, there was a cacophony of noises, but Li Xian paid it no mind, continuing to pound his chest and shake his body, tempering this "iron body and copper flesh."

However, every incense stick's worth of time, this sound would come again, as if someone was intentionally disturbing his mind.

Just then, Wang Wu led three runners, about to patrol the streets. They passed by the inner courtyard gate and were spotted by Li Xian.

Li Xian called out, "Wang Wu, come here for a moment."

Wang Wu led his men over, bowed respectfully, and stood at attention, awaiting orders.

Li Xian originally intended to have Wang Wu patrol the surroundings of the Martial Commandery Hall to check for suspicious figures, as this sound was displeasing to him. But on second thought, if there really were suspicious figures, Wang Wu likely wouldn't be a match. So he said, "Perform the Four Directions Fist. Let me see your progress."

Wang Wu happily replied, "Yes!" He had been practicing diligently and made good progress. He was just worried about having nowhere to display his skills and how to show off in front of Li Xian.

He immediately assumed a fist stance, striking left and right, feinting east and attacking west. His fist techniques coordinated with his footwork, flowing smoothly like clouds and water, completed in one breath. Unconsciously, he had already entered the doorway, nurturing a strand of internal Qi.

The runners watching from the side were filled with envy, cheering and shouting praises from the旁.

After completing the set, Li Xian gave a brief critique. Wang Wu kept it in mind; as long as he digested it slowly, he would surely make progress.

"It's coming again." Li Xian frowned as he heard the ethereal sound again. He asked, "Did you hear any strange noise?"

Wang Wu was startled and turned to look at the other runners. After confirming with each other, they all shook their heads. "Sir, we did not hear anything. It must be because our cultivation is shallow and our five senses are not sharp enough. We do not know where the strange sound you heard is coming from. We will go investigate immediately."

Li Xian shook his head. "This sound has no discernible source; it seems to come out of thin air. It's elusive." He then dismissed Wang Wu and the others.

Wang Wu stepped out of the Martial Commandery Hall and said to the runners beside him, "We eat and wear what the Sir provides while serving in the hall. We should share his worries. Let's patrol the area around the hall to see if any thieves are causing trouble!"

The runners all said, "Alright, Brother Wu, we all listen to you!"

So, the few of them headed east, circling the Martial Commandery Hall. Their eyes scanned the surroundings, observing passersby, and paying attention to any suspicious details.

After making a circle and about to give up, Wang Wu suddenly shouted, "Who goes there!" A chill ran down his spine as he indeed spotted a suspicious figure.

By the rear courtyard wall of the Martial Commandery Hall, a suspicious figure was clinging to the wall, sneaking around, extremely eerie.

The person wore a loose black robe. Their appearance and figure were both unclear.

The black-robed person heard the shout and looked back. They seemed to smile, neither hiding nor avoiding.

Wang Wu drew his blade, and the three runners behind him surrounded the figure simultaneously. They formed an encirclement, not daring to be careless, maintaining a distance of several steps. Wang Wu shouted angrily, "Who are you? What are you doing hiding here? Confess quickly!"

"You are runners of the Martial Commandery Hall?" The person's voice was hoarse, carrying a chilling coldness.

Wang Wu replied proudly, "Naturally."

"Hehe." The person laughed. "You lot are quite loyal. Since that's the case, why not help me and pass a message to your master?"

Wang Wu roared, "Whatever business you have, tell the Sir yourself! Seize him!"

Including Wang Wu, there were four runners, forming a four-way encirclement. This was the Four Directions Formation, evolved from the Four Directions Fist.

Wang Wu, having nurtured internal Qi, executed a leaping slash, chopping downward. The other three drew their blades simultaneously, their paths different, cutting off all escape routes.

However, the Four Directions Fist was merely a basic fist technique. Even if Li Xian had reached the pinnacle, he gradually felt the fist technique was insufficient. Decomposing the fist technique into a formation had its merits.

But if facing a martial arts expert, a master who had immersed themselves in the martial path for decades, it was far from enough.

The person stood motionless. Facing several blade shadows, they merely waved their sleeves. With sounds of "clang," "bang," and "crack," all four narrow blades shattered.

Wang Wu threw away the broken blade and stepped forward, striking at the shadow. He hadn't practiced fist techniques for long, but under Li Xian's guidance, his foundation was very solid.

Wang Wu thought, "This person's martial arts are formidable; it will be difficult to take them down. I just need to entangle them, and the Sir will surely notice." He threw a punch at the chest, but it was a feint.

He noticed that the person's right sleeve always hung down, as if it wasn't very mobile, which should be a weak point.

The moment his fist shot out, his body twisted.

The fist锋 suddenly changed direction, aiming for the person's right arm. The person didn't dodge or avoid. When the fist struck, it hit nothing but air. Wang Wu's heart sank: "It's empty."

At this time, the fist wind blew, lifting the person's hood, finally revealing their appearance. It was none other than Xu Liefeng of the Leopard Blade Sect. His face had changed drastically, pale and bloodless, with red tendrils growing from his skin.

Though he had a human form, he was no longer human.

Xu Liefeng said, "Tricks and gimmicks, how embarrassing." His teeth were caked with blood scum, smelling foul. He flicked his left hand, bringing up his wide robe, infused with refined internal Qi, as if wielding a great blade.

This was a martial art: Sleeve Blade, a mere small trick. But for Wang Wu, it was difficult to defend against.

Wang Wu let out a tragic cry as his right hand was severed at the root. He howled in pain, nearly fainting from the agony. Xu Liefeng felt it wasn't enough, thinking: "Good Li Xian, today I will sever your subordinate's limbs. When we formally duel in a few days, I will sever your limbs!"

He executed the "Sleeve Blade" again, slashing towards Wang Wu's right leg.

Just as blood and flesh were about to fly, a flying dagger shot forth, powerful and heavy. Xu Liefeng heard the wind and knew the dagger was formidable. He had no choice but to halt his attack, leaping sideways several zhang away.

The flying dagger slanted into the ground, its force so great it crushed the surrounding bricks and tiles to dust.

Li Xian activated the Breeze Leg, rushing over hastily and drawing his own blade.

It turned out...

The sounds of the fight had faintly reached Li Xian's ears. Knowing something was wrong, he immediately followed the sound and rushed over.

This prevented the tragedy.

Wang Wu covered his right hand, his face pale from excessive blood loss. "Sir, this person's movements are strange, and... and... not human!"

Li Xian nodded. He had already seen Xu Liefeng's appearance and was greatly shocked. But on the surface, he remained calm. "Xu Liefeng, we haven't seen each other for a few days. How did you turn into this appearance?"

"Hehe." Xu Liefeng said, "I am quite satisfied with this appearance. I have indeed gained a blessing in disguise. As for you, kid, I didn't expect that in just a few days, you've become even more formidable."

"The same to you." Li Xian said coldly.

"Since the Martial Commander is here, please take him away." Xu Liefeng laughed. "Our accounts will be settled in a few days."

"Please, Martial Commander, wash your head clean and await my arrival."

"Of course, if you were to wag your tail and beg for your wife's protection to save your life, then I would have nothing to say."

"Hahahaha."

With that, he jumped into the crowd and disappeared. His lightness skill was excellent; although one leg was severed, he walked as if he were a normal person.

Li Xian's eyes turned cold as he watched him leave. Knowing he had returned to the Leopard Blade Sect, he didn't pursue him. Instead, he turned to help Wang Wu with his injuries.

Wang Wu had lost too much blood and was on the verge of fainting. Li Xian helped him stabilize his blood, bandaged the wound, and applied golden sore medicine.

"Xiao Wu, rest well. I will get you some great medicine to ensure your life is not in danger."

"But this severed arm... there's no way to recover it."

"You were injured for my sake. I will make proper arrangements for you. Even with one hand severed, you can still practice martial arts. Rest assured."

Li Xian comforted Wang Wu.

Hearing this, Wang Wu felt at ease and fainted.
