# Chapter 20: Variables, Ahead of Schedule

Han Li was initially surprised by Zhang Tie's disappearance, and his heart couldn't help but feel sad. Later, Han Li speculated that Zhang Tie might have secretly slipped away out of fear of cultivating the fourth layer of "Elephant Armor Art." Upon learning that Doctor Mo intended to punish Zhang Tie's family for this matter, Han Li also thought of his own family. This was also why, even though Han Li clearly knew Doctor Mo coveted something from him, he could only diligently practice the Longevity Art as per Doctor Mo's demands. Doctor Mo knew Han Li and Zhang Tie had a close bond. Not wanting Han Li to dwell on this matter and delay his cultivation of the Evergreen Art, he rescinded the order to punish Zhang Tie's family and force his appearance.

Han Zhen's two objectives for this trip had been achieved. Han Zhen no longer had anything to worry about; he only needed to wait until the Evergreen Art was cultivated to the sixth layer perfection, then quietly observe the fallout between Han Li and Mo Ju-ren. Han Zhen had decided from the start not to interfere too much with Han Li's tribulation. Only by experiencing this lesson in life would Han Li truly transform.

Two more years passed, and Han Zhen was now sixteen. Several months prior, simply by meditating daily, his Evergreen Art had already broken through to the sixth layer, not far from perfection. Doctor Mo, on the other hand, had expected Han Li, whose disposition had finally settled, to relax again due to the previous farce. To his surprise, Han Li became even more diligent than he was before Doctor Mo's enticement, dedicating almost all his time to cultivation. Thus, he naturally cultivated to the third layer. This left Mo Ju-ren somewhat puzzled, but he still found Han Li's cultivation speed too slow. Han Zhen, too, had suddenly changed his behavior, no longer visiting Divine Hand Valley, as if the commotion he caused was genuinely out of concern for his younger brother's safety. Doctor Mo couldn't help but curse Yu Zhitong's primordial spirit within him, as it had caused him considerable trouble. Fortunately, Han Zhen kept his word and didn't reveal the Evergreen Art to outsiders, as if he feared losing face in front of Han Li, not even mentioning that he had tried cultivating it himself. Mo Ju-ren's body was deteriorating at an accelerated rate, and he became even more concerned about Han Li's cultivation progress.

However, Han Li, having cultivated the art to the third layer, though his five senses had not yet sublimated, they were much sharper than an ordinary person's. He discovered that behind Elder Mo's concern, there was also an unsettling emotion, as if he was looking at a rare treasure. Recalling what Brother Zhen had hinted at, and given that Zhang Tie had indeed disappeared, Doctor Mo's suspicions remained uncleared.

Han Li's wariness towards Doctor Mo grew even stronger. Afterward, because Mo Ju-ren had exhausted his precious medicines, he had to leave the mountain for a period to gather more herbs. After leaving behind the subsequent chants for the Longevity Art, Doctor Mo hastily descended the mountain. Han Li shared the acquired cultivation method with his cousin, Han Zhen. The two conversed at length, and Han Li voiced his concerns about Doctor Mo's peculiar behavior. He also finally obtained the martial arts technique he had long yearned for.

Later, Han Li experienced a heart devil invasion. He initially thought it was a "cultivation deviation" caused by practicing the chants. After using the peace talisman from the small beast-skin pouch to calm the heart devil, he finally remembered the small green bottle he had long forgotten. To figure out what the green liquid inside was, Han Li, whose Longevity Art was at a bottleneck, conveniently had time to conduct some research. Han Li finally discovered the secret that this green liquid could ripen medicinal herbs. After numerous experiments, Han Li finally understood that this bottle was absolutely invaluable. If anyone learned of the bottle's miraculous abilities, he certainly wouldn't live to see the next morning. From Doctor Mo's books, and stories told by Brother Zhen, Han Li knew that killing to seize treasures was commonplace in the world outside the mountains. For instance, two years ago, when Brother Zhen went down the mountain for training, he attracted the covetous gaze of many due to displaying martial arts cultivation far beyond ordinary people.

"I must never tell anyone about the bottle, and I must be careful when using it in the mountains," Han Li tightly gripped the bottle and made up his mind, resolving to keep it a secret and not reveal any information about the small green bottle to outsiders. Not even his most trusted Brother Zhen!

Thus, relying on the small green bottle to ripen herbs, Han Li successfully concocted over a dozen bottles of rare and precious medicines. Soon, with the aid of numerous rare elixirs, Han Li broke through to the fourth layer of the Evergreen Art before Doctor Mo returned. Upon reaching the fourth layer, Han Li immediately felt sensations entirely different from before. Unfortunately, Han Li hadn't had time to share this joy with his cousin, perhaps because it was the first time his Longevity Art progress had surpassed his cousin's. Just as Han Li was savoring this unforgettable sensation, contemplating how to show off in front of Han Zhen, Doctor Mo returned. Han Zhen, of course, had always sent people to monitor the situation in Divine Hand Valley. As soon as Doctor Mo returned, a disciple went down the mountain to report to Han Zhen.

"It's time to settle this!" In the cultivation room, Han Zhen opened his eyes. Coincidentally, on the very day Doctor Mo returned, his Evergreen Art reached sixth layer perfection.

As soon as Doctor Mo entered Divine Hand Valley, Han Li heard a distant cough. Han Li quickly put away his alchemy tools, cleared the scene, and then encountered Doctor Mo not far from the cultivation room. But he was utterly transformed from how he looked before leaving. If Doctor Mo before descending the mountain was gaunt and withered, now he looked as if one foot was already in the grave, appearing as if he could die at any moment.

Without a word, seeing that Han Li wasn't coming from the cultivation room, Mo Ju-ren said with a furious expression, "Why aren't you cultivating? Have you already broken through to the fourth layer?" As he spoke, a gloomy look crossed his face, and he reached out to grab Han Li's wrist. Han Li controlled the pseudo-true qi within his body to maintain the strength of the third layer—a secret he discovered after breaking through to the fourth. However, the subsequent events did not unfold as he expected. Doctor Mo effortlessly dismantled Han Li's small trick, and with a speed Han Li couldn't react to, he sealed his acupoints.

"Elder Mo, what exactly do you want?" Han Zhen arrived in Divine Hand Valley just in time. His five senses, perfected from the sixth layer of Qi Condensation, were naturally far superior to Doctor Mo's and Han Li's. Han Zhen quietly listened from the side, waiting for the master-disciple rift to reach its climax. Mo Ju-ren didn't bother with the lie about needing the Evergreen Art to stimulate true qi, because he was out of time. He had originally descended the mountain this time to find precious medicinal herbs for Han Li's subsequent cultivation, but unexpectedly, he was recognized by an enemy. After Zhang Tie was rescued by Han Zhen, Doctor Mo lost the assistance of his corpse puppet, and after a bitter struggle, he paid a greater price than he originally would have. After the bitter battle, although he killed the enemy, he had exhausted almost all his energy. With less than a month of life remaining, he was now in a situation where he had no choice but to seize Han Li's body.

Although Han Li had long secretly guarded against Doctor Mo, knowing the latter harbored intentions towards him, he never imagined there would be such a grand hidden plot; the chant, the other party's background, and experiences all far exceeded Han Li's imagination. Han Li's mind was in turmoil—a mix of fear, regret, and bewilderment. Despite delaying until now, he still couldn't think of a way to escape. He began to panic.
