# Chapter 24: Paper Crane

Being able to sell newly harvested seasonal rice made Gou Youyu reassess the strength of the person behind Gu Mo. While Gu Mo felt such connections were beyond his reach, he believed he could at least get closer to this errand-running outer disciple.

After all, since Gu Mo was selling goods on behalf of his mysterious backer, it was ultimately up to him to decide who to sell to.

"Brother Gu Mo, here are 330 spirit stones." Gou Youyu handed over a pouch containing payment for 100 catties of spirit rice. Then, he produced a bottle of wine and an additional 30 spirit stones. "Consider this a small token of appreciation."

"Hmm?"

Gu Mo was momentarily taken aback—since when did sales transactions include gifts? But realization quickly dawned. The shopkeeper clearly misunderstood his position.

Gu Mo saw no reason to correct this misconception. Letting Gou Youyu believe he had powerful backing would serve as both protection against ill intentions and a source of tangible benefits—a double advantage.

"Many thanks, elder brother. I'll be sure to bring my next batch of spirit rice to you." Accepting the gifts, Gu Mo made his promise. After all, he could sell his rice to whomever he pleased.

Gou Youyu's heart swelled with joy at this assurance. A reliable source of premium spirit rice had just fallen into his lap.

As Gu Mo left the shop, he considered asking Gou Youyu—a veteran of the market with decades of connections—to help find a cultivation-concealing technique. With his extensive network, the shopkeeper would undoubtedly be more efficient than Gu Mo in locating such items. Moreover, given Gou Youyu's current reliance on him, the man would surely spare no effort.

After some deliberation, Gu Mo decided against raising the matter during their first meeting. He would search on his own first. If unsuccessful, he could always mention it during their next rice transaction.

"First, to buy a paper crane for travel!"

The weight of the pouch—now containing 360 spirit stones—felt substantial in his hand. A year ago, when he'd first become an outer disciple, Gu Mo had possessed only nine stones, three of which came from trading pills with Yao Shifeng. Now, with his newfound wealth, acquiring basic cultivator tools like a paper crane was finally possible.

Paper cranes fell under the category of talismans, available at specialized shops, while magical swords would require visiting artifact stores. However, even low-grade magical artifacts started at four-digit prices—far beyond Gu Mo's current means. The same went for the formation arrays he desired.

What Gu Mo could afford now were low-level talismans and pills, neither of which he urgently needed. Basic talismans' offensive power paled in comparison to his Golden Metal Qi technique, which had grown stronger through repeated use and increased proficiency.

Still, having a few talismans as backup wouldn't hurt—they consumed minimal spiritual energy compared to his technique. As for pills, cultivation-boosting varieties held little appeal. Gu Mo relied on solar essence for advancement, which came without the side effects of medicinal pills. While healing, detoxification, and energy-restoration pills might be worth acquiring when resources allowed, they weren't priorities yet.

His immediate needs were a cultivation-concealing technique and a protective formation array for his spirit field. With solar flowers hidden among ordinary spirit sunflowers, an additional layer of concealment would provide peace of mind.

After browsing a talisman shop, Gu Mo emerged with a paper crane that cost him eight spirit stones—three more than what he might have paid from a rogue cultivator in the marketplace. But he chose the reputable shop run by the sect's Talisman Peak for guaranteed quality. The last thing he wanted was mid-flight failure.

With the rice sold and transportation secured, Gu Mo's market errands were complete. Yet he wasn't ready to return. The rogue cultivators' stalls in the square still beckoned—after all, that was where legends were born.

Upon arrival, the scene resembled a mundane marketplace more than an immortal gathering, save for the occasional spiritual fluctuations from the vendors.

"So lacking in immortal ambiance," Gu Mo grumbled internally before diving in.

"Esteemed fellow cultivator, this treasure was excavated from ancient ruins. Though its origins elude me, I'll offer you a bargain," boomed a burly man, thrusting a piece of scrap metal toward Gu Mo.

Quickening his pace, Gu Mo fled the scene, his earlier hopes of finding hidden treasures now replaced by embarrassment. These rogue cultivators, hardened by years of struggle, were far too shrewd for an inexperienced disciple like him to outwit. Without the expertise to authenticate techniques or artifacts, any attempt at bargain hunting would likely leave him penniless.

Having cultivated for barely over a year, Gu Mo was a mere novice compared to these veterans. Fortunately, the market was just one potential avenue for obtaining a concealment technique. He still had sect contribution points and his new connection with Gou Youyu.

What Gu Mo truly lacked wasn't discerning judgment—it was resources and sect contributions.

Abandoning thoughts of miraculous finds, he focused instead on practical items with clear value. Soon, one particular object at a stall caught his eye.
