Chapter 369: Little Ice Lump: "Brother," Li Mo is a Bad Child

"Is there a possibility of leading Little Ice Lump out, thereby preventing her from experiencing everything that happens tonight in the Ying family courtyard?"

Li Mo squeezed her cool, soft little hand while digging into his pocket for the snacks he had snatched earlier, his mind racing.

He turned his head and asked, "Ice Sister, do you want to go out and take a look?"

"Go out?"

"Yeah, it's the New Year, and Qinghe County is bustling."

"...."

Since Little Ice Lump didn't say anything, Li Mo took it as a yes.

He acted immediately.

He took her small hand and headed toward the courtyard gate.

The wind from the Qing River blew gently in the distance.

The faint, orchid-like fragrance of the young girl drifted over with the wind, and occasionally, a few strands of her hair brushed against his neck, tickling him. She had come out in a hurry today and hadn't tied her hair up.

"Woof!"

The little yellow dog at the courtyard entrance saw the two little ones, stood up, and let out a low growl. Unfortunately, it lacked any deterrent power. With two white spots above its eyebrows, it didn't look fierce at all, just silly and cute.

"?"

Ying Bing's brows furrowed slightly as she stared at it. The little yellow dog's growl immediately turned into a whimper.

"Good boy,, don't go snitching."

Li Mo seriously took out a piece of dried meat and threw it to the dog, which then cowardly wagged its tail.

Why did he feel like he was sneaking around? Wait, why did he say "again"?

Running away with a young lady who never leaves home in broad daylight—if they got caught... he would definitely get hung up and beaten when he got home.

This is a dream, this is a dream...

"Have you never been outside before?"

Li Mo didn't know much about Little Ice Lump's life before she came to his house.

"I went out once, to see a doctor. I woke up in the clinic."

Little Ying Bing was led forward, looking at the scenery outside the courtyard. Her eyes seemed to brighten, feeling both curious and timid about the outside world. The lively brightness belonging to a girl her age seemed to have quietly returned to her, just a little.

Li Mo found it amusing and deliberately let go of her small hand, walking a bit faster.

Little Ice Lump would pout unhappily, trotting a few steps to catch up. She wouldn't speak, just quietly reached out her hand, waiting for him to hold it again.

She looked exactly like a winter spirit of the new year.

"So cute even when she's small..."

Li Mo muttered to himself.

Ying Bing's small hand hung in the air, curling slightly. "What did you say?"

Li Mo put on a serious face. "I said, as the first good friend to take you out to play, shouldn't you call me 'Brother'?"

"But you're younger than me."

Little Ying Bing tilted her head, looking at him in confusion.

"That's because you don't go out and are ignorant of the world," Li Mo said confidently. "Among good friends, girls call boys 'Brother.' It's a custom in Qinghe County. Look, Uncle Ying is younger than Auntie, but Auntie sometimes calls Uncle Ying 'Brother' too."

"?"

Little Ying Bing's gaze drifted, as if she were recalling something, looking a bit dazed.

Mother did occasionally call Father 'Brother'...

But is that the same thing?

Looking at Little Li Mo's serious face with a hint of baby fat, Little Ice Lump lowered her eyes, the frost within them trembling.

"Bro... Brother."

"!"

Even though he was the one who coaxed her into it.

When those two crisp words rang in his ear, Li Mo still felt as if struck by lightning, his whole body going numb.

The Phoenix Empress, the protagonist of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands in the future!

Usually, she calls him "stinky little brother"!

Although this Ice Lump is the幼崽 (cub) version... not that peerless, aloof, ethereal Frost Immortal.

But precisely because of that!

The contrast was maximized at this moment, enough to instantly drain anyone's HP bar!

Even Ultraman wouldn't be able to take it.

"Is that enough?"

---

"Um... of course! Let's go, I'll buy you whatever you want to eat today. Have you ever had sugar-coated haws, or Donkey Rolling (a snack)?"

Little Li Mo's scalp tingled.

He muttered as he led her outside.

But as they walked, he felt the small hand in his palm tighten. Looking at her little face, he saw a hint of pain, and beads of sweat appeared on her pale forehead.

Every step they took outward, the pain deepened.

It became so painful that her eyes lost focus, as if she couldn't feel anything from the outside world.

Li Mo froze.

He snapped back to his senses and finally看清 (saw clearly) his surroundings.

Emptiness.

The Qing River in the distance was still flowing, the streets below were bustling with the New Year's market, but there was a large blank space separating these scenes from the Ying family courtyard. It hadn't been visible when he looked down earlier.

It was as if a pencil drawing had been erased, leaving a circle of blank space.

The mountain of the Ying family courtyard was like an island surrounded by nothingness.

"When Little Ice Lump went out to see the doctor, she was in a coma..."

"A person cannot dream of something they have never seen."

"And everything outside the Ying family courtyard, she has never been to, so in her dream, it is an unreachable place?"

Li Mo understood.

Using a game as a metaphor, the market in the distance and the Qing River were just 'textures'!

Only the Ying family courtyard was playable. He was currently taking Little Ice Lump and crashing into an 'invisible wall'!

Seeing her face turn increasingly pale, Li Mo dared not go any further. He quickly took her back.

"We can't get out, we can only stay here. That means we can't escape before the 'New Year Beast' arrives."

"What should we do? Fight it head-on?"

The Little Tyrant with the Divine Hammer, Little Li, is indeed the Fourth Hidden Dragon. He can defeat opponents even at the peak of the Sixth Grade.

But this is in Little Ice Lump's dream.

Right now, he is just a child. Forget about a disaster beast, even the mother of the little yellow dog at the gate could chase him down for two streets.

There is only one path left: to wake up the 'master' of the dream.

A person is invincible in their own dream...

"Time is running out."

The sky was turning towards dusk. Li Mo looked at Little Ice Lump.

"Weren't we going to play on the street?"

Little Ying Bing didn't remember what had just happened at all.

She was still stuck in the moment she called Li Mo "Brother" and asked him to take her to the street.

Li Mo led her back. "It's getting late. If Uncle and Auntie can't find us during dinner, they'll worry."

"?"

Little Ying Bing pulled her hand back. Her expression was cold and serious, vaguely carrying the aura of the big Ice Lump. "Li Mo."

"Yeah?"

"You lied to me. You're a bad child."

"....."

Although he did trick Little Ice Lump into calling him "Brother," he really wanted to take her away from here more than anyone else!

Unfortunately, he couldn't. Little Ice Lump didn't even remember what just happened. Where could he reason this out!

Now Little Ice Lump is angry, and she won't let him hold her hand anymore.

"Wait, we can't go out today, but I can draw it for you first. You can see where you want to play, and we can go directly there next time."

"You... know how to draw?"

"Hmph, not just know how to, bring me the brush and ink!"

Little Li Mo's eyes shifted. When he mentioned drawing, he seemed to have an idea.

First, things that people haven't seen before won't appear in dreams.

So his drawings would be things Little Ice Lump hasn't seen!

He could draw the Qingyuan Sect, draw the Autumn Water Pavilion, and even draw the grown-up Big Ice Lump!

Seeing those unfamiliar yet familiar scenes, she might be触动 (moved), and her self-consciousness might awaken?!

It's killing two birds with one stone!

Truly worthy of you, the genius Little Li!

...

PS: I have been quite serious these past few chapters. Although there are fewer details in the writing style, the plot really cost me a lot of brain cells.

Attentive readers might have noticed that from the beginning of the book until now, comparing the text before and after, I have made some small progress.

It was my first time writing a fantasy novel, and the beginning was mediocre. It's all thanks to everyone's support.

I thank all the readers who supported my growth, and to the readers who have read this far, mwah! 030.
