# Chapter 65: Group Proposal

Fellow Daoist Hu, named Hu Jun, was a cultivator at the tenth level of Qi Condensation. His strength was renowned far and wide. Rumor had it that he was the mastermind behind a certain secret shop in Myriad Immortals City, often presiding over clandestine market trade fairs. Of course, rumors were just rumors; no one could confirm this. Many secret shop owners, like Lu Xu, possessed the ability to change their appearance, making it impossible to see their true form even with Spirit Eye Arts.

Today was his hundredth birthday. People from Fire Cloud Alley, and even the neighboring streets, came to offer their congratulations. Those who could reside in these alleys were naturally not ordinary individuals. They were either cultivators in the late stage of Qi Condensation or masters of professions such as talisman masters, alchemists, and so on. After all, common cultivators couldn't afford the annual rent of twenty to thirty spirit stones.

Upon entering, Lu Xu surveyed the scene. There were seven or eight banquet tables in the courtyard, each capable of seating about ten people. He didn't recognize most of the people, but after a quick glance, Lu Xu immediately spotted a familiar figure. Dressed in a black gown, her figure was striking, her beauty captivating. A cool aloofness graced her face, making her quite noticeable even in a gathering full of masters.

Mo Qingchan!

This Mo family prodigy had also appeared in Myriad Immortals City. She sat at one of the foremost tables, accompanied by a graceful young woman, the two engaged in conversation. Talisman Master Wang noticed Lu Xu's gaze, chuckled softly, and said, “This Fairy Mo moved to our Fire Cloud Alley over a year ago. She lives in Fellow Daoist Wen's residence, and just like you, Brother Han, she's from Wei State!”

“Ah, the successor of the Azure Lake Mo family. This woman is quite famous in our Wei State as well!” Lu Xu nodded, speaking casually.

Talisman Master Wang stroked his long beard and said, “This woman possesses a High-grade Spiritual Root and is also expected to reach Foundation Establishment. Come, let's go and get acquainted!”

Talisman Master Wang pulled Lu Xu to the main banquet table, and the two sat down. This was clearly the host's table, and those who could sit here were all significant figures. Talisman Master Wang himself was at the tenth level of Qi Condensation, a High-grade Talisman Master, and on good terms with Hu Jun. Naturally, there was no issue with him sitting here. But Lu Xu was an unfamiliar face. The moment he sat down, several gazes immediately turned towards him.

“And who might this fellow daoist be?” an old woman at the tenth level of Qi Condensation cast a surprised look.

Talisman Master Wang quickly introduced, “This is Fellow Daoist Han Feiyu, from the Han clan of Wei State, and he is a High-grade Talisman Master!” Upon hearing the words “High-grade Talisman Master,” the expressions of several people at the main table softened, and they all cast friendly glances at Lu Xu.

“I never expected another High-grade Talisman Master to emerge in our Fire Cloud Alley. This is truly cause for celebration, haha!”
“Fellow Daoist Han looks quite young. Foundation Establishment is within reach!”
No one wished to offend a cultivator who possessed such a skill. The cultivators present all tacitly acknowledged Lu Xu's qualification to sit at the main table. Only Mo Qingchan, upon hearing “Han Clan of Immortals,” a hint of doubt flickered in her eyes.

“I've never seen Fellow Daoist Han before. Have you moved here recently?” a burly middle-aged man asked with curiosity.

Lu Xu shook his head. “I've been in Fire Cloud Alley for some time now!”

Talisman Master Wang laughed heartily. “Fellow Daoist Han is someone with prospects for Foundation Establishment, so naturally, he must constantly cultivate in seclusion, unlike us old folks who have lost hope and frequently come out to gather!” Talisman Master Wang then proceeded to introduce the others present to Lu Xu. The old woman was a Mid-grade Alchemist, and the burly middle-aged man was the leader of a demon-hunting group, also at the tenth level of Qi Condensation.

Lu Xu cupped his hands in greeting to each of them. Every single one could be considered among the strongest below the Foundation Establishment stage. In Myriad Immortals City, they might not seem so prominent, but if they were in Wei State, or in Azure Lake Market City, they would be significant figures, second only to the highest authority.

“This is Hu Yan, the biological daughter of Fellow Daoist Hu Jun. She possesses a High-grade Earth Spiritual Root and is already at the ninth level of Qi Condensation at forty-three years old. She too has prospects for Foundation Establishment in the future!” Talisman Master Wang said to Lu Xu, pointing at the beautiful young woman beside Mo Qingchan.

“Little Sister greets Big Brother Han!” Hu Yan rose and bowed gracefully.

Lu Xu quickly waved his hand, saying he wouldn't dare, while silently complaining, “Little sister? You're older than me!”

After Hu Yan sat down, she quietly added, “The sister next to me, like Fellow Daoist Han, is also from Wei State, originating from the Azure Lake Mo family!”

Mo Qingchan rose and bowed to everyone. Her expression was calm, but when she looked at Lu Xu, a peculiar glint appeared in her eyes.

“Azure Lake Mo family? The Foundation Establishment family?” After an exclamation, the gazes of everyone at the table immediately changed towards Mo Qingchan, carrying a hint of caution. They were either rogue cultivators or from ordinary Qi Condensation families. A Foundation Establishment family was a colossal entity to them.

“The Azure Lake Mo family is a thing of the past. Now, little sister is just an ordinary rogue cultivator, like all of you!” Mo Qingchan shook her head, speaking in a calm tone.

Upon hearing this, no one dared to take her words at face value. Who knew how much hidden heritage a former Foundation Establishment family might possess?

“Hahahaha, thank you all for attending this old man's birthday banquet!” Accompanying a hearty laugh, an old man with sparse white hair and a ruddy complexion emerged from the house. He cupped his hands to everyone, spoke a string of grateful words, then walked to the main table, raised a cup of spirit wine, and drank with everyone.

After sitting down, Hu Jun's gaze swept across the table. When he saw Lu Xu, he was first startled, then smiled and said, “This must be Fellow Daoist Han Feiyu, the owner of Yifang Studio, correct?”

“Fellow Daoist Hu has keen insight!” Lu Xu cupped his hands.

“Brother Han looks very young. You shouldn't have passed the sixty-year mark yet, right?”

“Mmm, indeed, there are still a few years until sixty!” Lu Xu replied vaguely.

Upon hearing this, the smile on Hu Jun's face grew even warmer: “Since you haven't reached sixty, Foundation Establishment is promising. Brother Han, do you have any thoughts on Foundation Establishment Pills?”

“I don't have any thoughts yet!” Lu Xu didn't know what the old man's intention was, so he gave a vague answer.

“In that case, this old man has a proposal. Fellow Daoist Han and all those present might wish to hear it!” Hu Jun looked at the few people present with a full smile.

“Brother Hu, I've long known that you must have some idea for gathering everyone at this birthday banquet. Just speak your mind!” the burly middle-aged man said forthrightly.

Hu Jun stretched out his hand and set up a sound-insulating spell, his expression becoming solemn. “Among those present, three still have hope for Foundation Establishment: my humble daughter, Fairy Mo, and Fellow Daoist Han!”

“All of you meet the most basic conditions for Foundation Establishment, lacking only a Foundation Establishment Pill. However, I believe everyone knows that the Heavenly Spirit Flower, required to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill, is beyond our reach!” As soon as Hu Jun spoke these words, everyone nodded. Even Mo Qingchan among those present had no hope of obtaining a Heavenly Spirit Flower. Even if Azure Lake Market City hadn't been breached by the Black Robe Society, she wouldn't have been able to. The Mo family's spiritual vein had last produced a Heavenly Spirit Flower two hundred years ago, and it would take another hundred years for the next one to mature.

“Therefore, our only hope lies with second-tier demonic beasts!”

Upon hearing this, everyone generally understood Hu Jun's meaning. The burly middle-aged man crossed his arms and asked, “Brother Hu, are you suggesting we unite to form a large demon-hunting group to hunt second-tier demonic beasts?”

Everyone present was either at the ninth or tenth level of Qi Condensation. Not only were they powerful, but several of them were already leaders of demon-hunting groups. If they were to unite, then hunting second-tier demonic beasts might indeed not be hopeless.

“Precisely, that's what this Hu means!”

“Hmph, you wish to sacrifice us to benefit your daughter? I doubt there's such a good deal in this world, is there?” the old woman snorted coldly.

“Madam Ming misunderstands,” Hu Jun said slowly, a smile on his face. “I don't just want to help my daughter succeed, but also Fairy Mo, Fellow Daoist Han, and even the descendants of all you fellow daoists!”

“Madam Ming, although your grandson has a Mid-grade Spiritual Root, with your support as a Mid-grade Alchemist, he can also be expected to reach the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation before sixty, right?” Hu Jun asked, looking at the old woman.

“Hmph, my grandson is only seventeen. It's still too early for the Heavenly Barrier of Foundation Establishment!” the old woman sneered.

“Wouldn't that be perfect? We first join forces to help my daughter enter the Foundation Establishment stage. Then, my daughter, with her Foundation Establishment power, will help everyone hunt demonic beasts. After that, we help Fairy Mo and Fellow Daoist Han enter the Foundation Establishment stage. Then, with the power of three Foundation Establishment cultivators, we continue hunting demonic beasts to help your grandson, Madam Ming, and your son, Brother Lin, enter the Foundation Establishment stage...”

Hu Jun laid out his idea, and for a moment, silence fell upon everyone at the table.
