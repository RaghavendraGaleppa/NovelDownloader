# Chapter 84: The Talismans Are My Own Drawings

What put Chu Ning slightly at ease was that nothing special happened that night.

After waking up in the morning, Chu Ning continued to cultivate the Spirit Refining Art, and also practiced the Azurewood Everspring Art and the Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art once.

His overall condition had completely recovered.

[Spirit Refining Art, First Layer 145/1000]

Glancing at the progress of his Spirit Refining Art, Chu Ning's eyes flickered slightly.

Yesterday, with his intense talisman drawing and spiritual sense cultivation, the proficiency of his Spirit Refining Art had actually increased by a full 4 points in a single day.

Normally, it would only increase by 2 points.

However, Chu Ning also felt that such high-intensity spiritual sense usage and recovery still left him with a sense of fatigue.

Clearly, this method was not sustainable. The intensity could be appropriately lowered; that shouldn't be an issue.

In the morning, Chu Ning opened his shop doors, and as expected, some cultivators who had wanted to buy talismans but couldn't the day before came.

Chu Ning took the opportunity to inquire around, and the news he received was that the beast tide had struck again last night.

However, this time the attack was not just on the Li family of Yangling; some nearby cultivation families were also targeted.

Fortunately, everyone was better prepared this time, so before dawn, the attacks were repelled by the various cultivation families.

Moreover, the losses suffered by the major families were significantly less than those of the Li family of Yangling.

At the same time, Chu Ning also learned that, as expected, many rogue cultivators had already appeared near Yangling.

In fact, Chu Ning sold some talismans to a few passing rogue cultivators that very morning.

Having sold most of his talismans, Chu Ning once again closed his doors to craft more.

And, he kept his shop doors closed for the entire afternoon.

Throughout the majority of the day and most of the night, Chu Ning drew many more Elementary-grade Mid-tier Talismans and Elementary-grade Low-tier Talismans.

It was only on the morning of the third day that he reopened his shop doors to continue selling talismans.

Compared to the previous day, the clientele for talismans had changed significantly.

The day before, most were from various cultivation families.

They hadn't been able to buy during the market's opening day, and knowing that Chu Ning would resupply, they came even when the market wasn't officially open.

Today, however, the buyers were mainly rogue cultivators who had traveled from other places, and their purchase volume naturally couldn't compare to the previous two days.

Chu Ning didn't mind, instead taking the time to draw some more Elementary-grade Low-tier Talismans.

After all, the market's opening day was just one day away. He wasn't sure if the other shops of the Azure Stream Sect would open.

Chu Ning, for his part, was preparing to operate as usual.

Rather than fighting and struggling to survive out there, it was better to stably sell talismans in the market.

The third day was the market's opening day, but the people from the Azure Stream Sect still hadn't returned.

Chu Ning, however, continued to open his shop as usual. The market today had noticeably fewer people than before.

However, for several consecutive days, Chu Ning's shop had maintained a supply of high-quality Elementary-grade Mid-tier Talismans for sale, which quickly built his talisman shop's reputation nearby.

As a result, people came intermittently to buy talismans from his shop.

By midday, seeing that there were few people in the market, Chu Ning was about to put away the talismans from the counter.

Just then, a dozen figures approached from down the street.

Chu Ning saw them and realized they were his own sect members.

Leading them was Gu Xiaoqing, with a tall, robust cultivator beside her, followed by Shen Zhengquan, Luo Yiping, Lu Miaoying, and others.

In addition, there were more than ten other people, also wearing Azure Stream Sect robes, who were likely disciples sent as reinforcements.

For some reason, Du Han was not among them.

Chu Ning saw them, and naturally, they also saw Chu Ning holding talismans.

"Chu Ning!" Luo Yiping was the first to shout.

He quickly rushed over, pointing at the talismans in Chu Ning's hand, and gritting his teeth, exclaimed,

"You have so many talismans in your hand, yet a few days ago, you told us you had none left?

Do you know how difficult our situation was this time? If we had some talismans, we definitely wouldn't be in such a sorry state now."

Hearing Luo Yiping's words, Chu Ning couldn't help but look at the group with some surprise.

With their late-stage Qi Condensation cultivation, plus the presence of someone like Du Han, who was at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation and close to completion.

And looking at the group following them, it was clear that the sect had sent reinforcements.

How could they be in such a sorry state fighting some low-tier demon beasts?

However, when Chu Ning's gaze swept over the others,

Shen Zhengquan's face was equally filled with anger; his robe was torn in four or five places.

Even Gu Xiaoqing's hair was slightly disheveled, and as she looked at Chu Ning now, her delicate brows were furrowed.

"What, nothing to say?"

Luo Yiping stared directly at Chu Ning, his voice filled with anger.

Although Chu Ning didn't know why they were in such a predicament,

Since Luo Yiping was now directing his anger at him, Chu Ning certainly wouldn't take the blame.

In front of so many fellow disciples, he couldn't afford to bear the accusation of lacking sect loyalty.

Chu Ning calmly met Luo Yiping's gaze, "These talismans are ones I drew myself."

"Hmph!" Luo Yiping immediately scoffed.

"Do you really take us for fools?

You sold so many high-quality talismans in this shop that day, and it seems you haven't sold less these past two days. Could these possibly be ones you crafted?"

Shen Zhengquan's voice also came out at this moment.

"Junior Brother Luo, forget it. Let's wait until Deacon Lin and Senior Brother Du return and tell them about this."

Gu Xiaoqing hesitated slightly at this point, then sighed softly, her beautiful eyes turning towards Chu Ning.

"Junior Brother Chu, when I went out this time, all my healing pills were used up. I wonder if Junior Brother could draw a few Rejuvenation Talismans for me."

Hearing this, Chu Ning looked gratefully at Gu Xiaoqing.

"Senior Sister Gu, please wait a moment. I'll draw a few Rejuvenation Talismans right away."

As he spoke, Chu Ning took out talisman paper and a talisman brush from his storage bag.

Seeing this, Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan said nothing more, and simply watched Chu Ning with cold expressions.

They looked as if they were waiting to see his downfall.

The dozen or so Azure Stream Sect disciples following behind were now curiously looking at the group, unsure of what was happening.

Immediately, one of them busied himself asking Lu Miaoying for information.

Lu Miaoying glanced at Chu Ning and the others, hesitated for a moment, but finally did not hide anything and recounted the events in full.

Immediately, the tall, robust male disciple who had been standing beside Gu Xiaoqing immediately spoke up:

"If it's confirmed that these talismans were indeed drawn by Junior Brother Chu right now, then it's nothing. But if he concealed them before...

Hmph, I, Ding Bo, detest those who have no loyalty to the sect."

Although the others did not directly reply, they all nodded, largely agreeing with Ding Bo's opinion.

Meanwhile, Chu Ning, who had taken out his talisman crafting tools, remained silent.

He adjusted his breathing slightly, placed a blank talisman paper in front of him, and with a flick of his talisman brush, swiftly began drawing a Rejuvenation Talisman.

For Chu Ning, crafting this Elementary-grade Low-tier Talisman truly posed no difficulty at this point.

Even without much preparation or adjustment, and despite being watched by everyone,

Chu Ning completed the entire talisman drawing process smoothly, effortlessly, and swiftly.

Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan looked on, slightly taken aback.

However, Chu Ning had only drawn one talisman so far, so they didn't show much expression, continuing to observe coldly.

Chu Ning, without any pause, placed down the completed Rejuvenation Talisman and picked up another piece of talisman paper.

The same posture, the same speed, the same composure.

Just like a replica of the previous talisman, Chu Ning easily completed another Rejuvenation Talisman.

When Chu Ning easily completed two talismans in a row, everyone's expressions finally changed slightly.

The disciples who had initially looked at Chu Ning with suspicion now had softened gazes.

Gu Xiaoqing's eyes also held a hint of warmth.

Even Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan's expressions and gazes changed somewhat at this moment.

As the saying goes, laymen see the excitement, while experts see the skill.

They were all Outer Sect disciples; although they hadn't learned talisman crafting,

The state Chu Ning displayed while crafting talismans already indicated that, at the very least, Chu Ning indeed possessed a certain level of talisman crafting skill.

Especially when Chu Ning crafted ten talismans in one go, and seven of them succeeded, everyone's expressions towards Chu Ning became tinged with more surprise.

Such a success rate in talisman crafting, even they knew, was undoubtedly extremely outstanding.

Chu Ning put down his talisman brush, then picked up three talismans from in front of him.

He handed them to Gu Xiaoqing, Shen Zhengquan, and Luo Yiping.

It was obvious Chu Ning wanted the three of them to examine the talisman quality, and they understood, so they all accepted them.

As soon as the talismans were in hand, Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan fell silent.

The quality of these talismans was very high!

And they were drawn by Chu Ning right in front of everyone, which settled the matter.

Gu Xiaoqing's face completely returned to its former gentle expression, and she slowly spoke:

"I had no idea Junior Brother Chu's talisman crafting skills were so exquisite. Otherwise, before we set out, we should have waited for Junior Brother to draw some talismans for us to take."

Before Chu Ning could even speak, a voice suddenly rang out.

"Oh, so many people?"

Following the voice, a young cultivator quickly walked over from behind the crowd.

Chu Ning glanced at him; he vaguely recalled this cultivator from yesterday, who had come to buy talismans.

And then, the young cultivator immediately spoke with an urgent tone:

"Shopkeeper, are so many people buying talismans? Do you still have the Yin Lightning Talismans and Adamant Talismans I bought yesterday? I'd like five more of each."

"Yes!" Chu Ning didn't think much of it.

He casually pulled ten talismans from his storage bag and handed them to the young man.

Seeing that no one else expressed interest in the talismans, the young man delightedly took them, then pulled out spirit stones and handed them over.

"Good thing I came a step early. Thank you, fellow Daoists, for letting me go first."

After saying this, the young man hurriedly left with the talismans.

As soon as the young man left, Luo Yiping, who had been silent, scoffed coldly again.

"Chu Ning, don't tell me, these high-quality Elementary-grade Mid-tier Talismans were also drawn by you."

"Junior Brother Chu's talisman crafting skills are truly astonishing," Shen Zhengquan added.

His tone sounded like praise, but the sarcasm within it was clearly audible to Chu Ning.

He had maintained a facade earlier, but now he openly mocked Chu Ning without reservation.

Gu Xiaoqing sighed softly. This time, she said nothing more.

Even Gu Xiaoqing didn't believe Chu Ning could craft such high-quality Elementary-grade Mid-tier Talismans.

In fact, besides Mu Ling, no one else in the sect had ever seen Chu Ning craft Elementary-grade Mid-tier Talismans.

Chu Ning also sighed inwardly at this moment.

If he hadn't drawn these Elementary-grade Mid-tier Talismans in front of everyone today,

He feared this matter would have dragged on indefinitely.

"Junior Brother will draw an Adamant Talisman. Please Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters, offer your guidance."

After saying this, Chu Ning once again picked up his talisman brush.

The others vaguely guessed Chu Ning's intent, and their expressions shifted to surprise.

Luo Yiping's face flashed with suspicion, and he exchanged a glance with Shen Zhengquan.

The next moment, both of them shook their heads, their eyes betraying disbelief.

They had some contact with disciples from the Talisman Pavilion and naturally knew the difficulty of crafting Elementary-grade Mid-tier Talismans.

How could Chu Ning, someone who had just entered the Outer Sect from being a menial disciple, have mastered Elementary-grade Mid-tier talisman crafting in such a short time?

Especially, the talismans that person just bought clearly seemed to be of high quality as well.

As everyone watched intently, Chu Ning began crafting.

Although the crowd didn't understand the specific drawing methods for different talismans, simply from Chu Ning's more complex spirit patterns,

They could infer that this talisman was of a higher grade than the Rejuvenation Talisman drawn earlier.

Just as everyone was showing surprise,

"Whoosh!"

In front of Chu Ning, the Adamant Talisman suddenly spontaneously combusted, turning into ash.

Seeing this, the slight suspicion on Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan's faces completely vanished.

"Chu Ning, stop this act and stop wasting everyone's time.

Do you really think you're a Second-tier Talisman Master?"

Luo Yiping's face was full of mockery.

Shen Zhengquan, at this moment, did not speak.

Looking at the focused Chu Ning, he seemed lost in thought.

Gu Xiaoqing was the same; they two were different from Luo Yiping. Luo Yiping belonged to the Spirit Beast Stable and had no contact with paths like pills, talismans, artifacts, or formations.

Although this Adamant Talisman wasn't successfully drawn, Chu Ning's state while crafting it vaguely made them feel something.

Chu Ning ignored Luo Yiping for now, merely shaking his head slightly and muttering to himself,

"The success rate for crafting these Elementary-grade Mid-tier Talismans still needs to be improved. I originally planned to just succeed and show them the talisman directly, but I didn't expect to fail."

Even though Chu Ning had been continuously crafting talismans for the past seven days, on the most difficult Adamant Talisman,

His success rate was still not as good as with Elementary-grade Low-tier Talismans.

He picked up the talisman brush again, dipped it in ink, and prepared to continue crafting.

"What are you all gathered here for?"

Accompanying this voice, Lin Changqing descended in a spirit boat in front of Chu Ning's shop. Du Han was with him.

"Deacon Lin, you've come just in time!"

Luo Yiping's face lit up with joy upon seeing Lin Changqing and Du Han arrive.

"When Senior Brother Du called everyone to go resist the beast tide, Chu Ning refused to participate, citing his low cultivation. That's one thing.

But the crucial point is that he clearly brought many talismans from the sect's Talisman Pavilion, and when Senior Brother Du asked him for them, he refused to hand them over!"

Before Lin Changqing could speak again, Luo Yiping rapidly poured out his complaints like spilling beans.
