# Chapter 27: Scarlet Firmament Sword, Hundred Beasts' Blood Tempering

"Was that really a monster just now?"

Li Mo thought about it, then felt something was off.

The Divine Edge Cave was within the Clear Stream Sect, and its entrance was guarded by inner sect deacons. How could a monster get in?

Perhaps it was just some unsightly senior brother...

Li Mo no longer dwelled on the matter.

*Thump—*

His footsteps had already landed on the ground of the fourth floor.

The sharp killing intent that assailed him, even with his initial success in body tempering, made him instantly feel an almost overwhelming pressure. His flesh, comparable to that of a peak mortal weapon, actually felt a faint stinging pain.

"Just the aura emanating from it is this terrifying."

"It's more than ten times stronger than the third floor."

Li Mo took a light breath, and instantly, even his internal organs felt a slight tingling numbness. Fortunately, he had trained his organs and meridians together; otherwise, he feared he wouldn't be able to endure it now.

"What kind of weapons are nurtured on this floor?"

Li Mo raised his gaze.

He saw that in the vast fourth floor, half was congealed with frost, while the other half was so scorching hot it distorted the air. One had to remember, this was inside a mountain cave. This scene was simply too unbelievable.

The remaining weapons were also much fewer. In total, there were only nine stone platforms, each with a weapon embedded in it.

On the first one, lay a longsword, entirely crimson and crystalline.

Li Mo walked closer and found inscriptions carved in front of the stone platform:

"Forged by Zhu Zizhong, the first Peak Master of Divine Armament Peak, inspired by the sight of two suns in the sky, in imitation of the 'Skyflame' sword, ranked fifth on the Nine Provinces Divine Armament List. It became a Profound Armament and was named Scarlet Firmament."

This was the first line of text on the stone platform.

A Profound Armament!

Weapons were categorized as Mortal Tools, Sharp Tools, Keen Tools, and Renowned Tools. Above Renowned Tools were fifth-tier Profound Armaments—a Profound Armament, indeed.

As for what was above Profound Armaments? Li Mo didn't know; he had never even heard of them.

But according to the inscriptions on the stone platform, if this Profound Armament was merely an imitation, then its prototype, the Skyflame Sword, must be even more formidable.

"Nine Provinces Divine Armament List..."

"The first Peak Master of Divine Armament Peak."

Li Mo was secretly amazed. As far as he knew, currently, Divine Armament Peak struggled to even produce a Renowned Tool after a long time. In the past, they could actually forge Profound Armaments? Didn't that mean when this sword was forged, the Great Yu Dynasty had only recently unified the world?

There was more text below, so Li Mo continued reading.

[Qin Xiaomeng, fourth Peak Master of Jade Cluster Peak of Clear Stream Sect, retrieved this sword today!]

[Luo Rulong, sixth Peak Master of Jade Cluster Peak of Clear Stream Sect, respectfully invited the Scarlet Firmament Sword!]

[Yue Hong, thirteenth Peak Master of Sunset Glow Peak of Clear Stream Sect, whose Blazing Sun Sword Art reached the 'transformation into essence' realm, requested the Scarlet Firmament Sword!]

...

The further down the list, the longer the interval between the Peak Masters who came to retrieve the sword. Li Mo's thoughts churned. This indicated that fewer and fewer people in the Clear Stream Sect were qualified to wield this Profound Armament.

Moreover... this sword seemed to have been lost for a period of time.

[Shang Wu, thirty-third Peak Master of Jade Cluster Peak of Clear Stream Sect, killed a 'Heaven'-ranked assassin from the Fine Rain Pavilion and recovered the Scarlet Firmament Sword.]

Li Mo scanned the nine stone platforms. The timelines clearly differed, but the recorded content was similar to the first one. Three of them were empty, unsure if they were lost or in the hands of a high-ranking sect elder.

He roughly understood. What was placed here were all Profound Armaments forged by Divine Armament Peak throughout the generations. As long as one could gain the Profound Armament's recognition, they could become its master. When they no longer had the ability to wield the Profound Armament, they had to return it.

"How does one become an Armament Master?"

It would be a lie to say that young student Li wasn't envious. A Profound Armament, indeed. He had always dreamt of owning a magnificent longsword. On these stone platforms, there were only two swords in total. One was named Heavenly Frost, and the other was this Scarlet Firmament.

*Buzz—*

Suddenly, the sound of a sword humming rang out. It seemed to have sensed Li Mo approaching. The Scarlet Firmament Sword, embedded in the stone platform, vibrated incessantly.

The next second, Li Mo's vision blurred. Not far away, a swordsman appeared, standing with a sword on his back. The swordsman's face was indistinct, and he wore nothing more than a simple short shirt, yet an air of sharpness naturally emanated from him.

The other party did not speak, but Li Mo seemed to understand their meaning.
