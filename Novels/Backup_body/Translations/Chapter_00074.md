# Chapter 74: Ancient Moon Peak Master Battles the Great Fengdu Deity!

With the addition of the Supreme Elder of Kunlun Immortal Sect, Elder Xuji, this ragtag group now had a smooth path ahead.

Ordinary demonic entities dared not approach. Even ghost kings and corpse deities comparable to human immortals sensed the auras of both Elder Xuji and Guigu Lingguan and were filled with trepidation.

As for Elder Xuji, in the presence of the "Divine Lord," he became exceptionally valiant, eagerly showcasing his combat prowess. Occasionally, when encountering malevolent beings that instinctively retreated out of fear, the usually cautious Elder Xuji—who avoided being exploited—would charge forward, annihilating them on the spot.

Now, ahead of them stood a towering tree on a cliff, corrupted by sinister energy and transformed into a malevolent tree demon king. Normally, it rooted itself into the cliff, absorbing yin energy, its branches sweeping across the land, using countless corpses and anomalies as nourishment.

Originally intending to ambush this group of living beings, the tree demon king sensed the auras of two human immortals and retracted its branches. However, fearing that the Divine Lord might perceive him as cowardly, Elder Xuji mustered his courage and charged into the yin energy-filled cliff, shouting, "Come out if you dare! Weren’t you planning to rob us? Face me in battle!"

At first, the tree demon king responded, "Esteemed one, do not be so aggressive. You may pass—I have no intention of fighting you!"

But as Elder Xuji pressed on, the tree demon king roared in frustration, "You go too far! This is my territory! Do not think I fear you—I merely hesitate to engage in a battle that would deplete my energy, leaving me vulnerable to other demon kings! Do you not fear the same?"

Elder Xuji gasped in shock. "You, a mere tree demon, can tell I’m insane?" He felt the opponent was unfathomable but refused to back down. "Come up here if you dare!"

The tree demon king retorted, "You come down here if you dare!"

Elder Xuji glanced back at Guigu Lingguan, his gaze lingering on the fragment of the broken jade, then mustered his courage to charge into the cliff.

"Enough, enough. Spare it for my sake," Yuan Zhengfeng interjected. "We may face greater dangers ahead. Conserve your strength in case we encounter more formidable demonic immortals or evil gods. As our protector, you can’t rely solely on me to act, can you?"

Elder Xuji considered this and reluctantly retreated, grumbling. Internally, he sighed in relief, wiping sweat from his brow. "That tree is one of the remnants from back then, only slightly weaker than me. Killing it wouldn’t be easy, and if I were injured, the Divine Lord might abandon me!"

Thus, under Elder Xuji’s lead, they advanced along Fengdu Mountain.

Meanwhile, Guigu Lingguan’s thoughts turned to Yuan Zhengfeng. "I’ve always found it strange—how can such a small jade fragment serve as a vessel for your power? Normally, a human immortal’s power resides best in their own body. While celestial stones can act as alternative vessels, they must be whole and carved into divine forms to transfer the soul and prolong life. Yet this tiny fragment holds your power—what kind of treasure is this?"

Unable to contain his excitement, he produced a fine blade, intending to slice the jade for study.

"What are you doing?!" Yuan Zhengfeng roared in panic.

"Stop!" Li Zhengjing snatched the jade fragment back, tucking it into his robes. With this, he could wield Yuan Zhengfeng’s human immortal-level power, making him invincible below the immortal realm—even the near-death Ninth Helm Master of the Golden Ship of Salvation had fallen to him. How could he let Guigu Lingguan dissect such a crucial asset?

"Scoundrel! How dare you disrespect the Divine Lord? I’ll kill you!" Elder Xuji bellowed. "You want to cut up the Divine Lord? You’re ruining my path to ascension! I’ll fight you to the death!"

Guigu Lingguan calmly produced a set of needles, planting them one by one into the ground. Elder Xuji took two steps back, his expression oscillating between fear and resolve.

Guigu Lingguan turned to Li Zhengjing. "Just one slice. Truly, just one." His eyes burned with hunger—had it not been for their acquaintance and his wariness of the madman beside them, he would have seized the jade by force.

"Wait!" Li Zhengjing stored Yuan Zhengfeng away and retrieved another object. "You mentioned celestial stones as alternative vessels. Is this one still usable?" It was a fragment of a statue from the ruined temple, referred to by the Five Elements Creation Tree as a "divine corpse."

"It is, but too small to hold much power—practically useless," Guigu Lingguan said. "Celestial stone fragments pale in comparison to the jade fragment housing our half-dead friend. Divine forms made from celestial stones are called 'false gods,' while those made from this jade could truly be called 'true gods.'"

He sighed. "No wonder Elder Xuji thought he’d shattered a true god back then."

Li Zhengjing, Yuan Zhengfeng, and the wall-perching bird understood his implication. Compared to "false gods" crafted from celestial stones, divine forms from this jade were far superior, worthy of being called "true gods." Yet true gods, as recognized by the world, were beings on par with ascended celestial immortals—eternal and supreme. How could such a being have been shattered by Elder Xuji?

The "true god" Elder Xuji believed he’d struck was likely just a "false god" with a superior vessel. 

"Then what of these alternative vessels?" Li Zhengjing mused. "Aren’t gods born of heaven and earth?"

"Celestial stones absorb the essence of sun and moon, often giving rise to sentience—thus becoming natural gods," Guigu Lingguan explained. "If worshipped, gathering mortal faith and incense, the consciousness born from collective belief also becomes a god."

He continued, "However, some human immortals, upon obtaining whole celestial stones, carve them with nine orifices, limbs, meridians, and organs, then transfer their power into them, gaining a second life as human immortal gods."

The wall-perching bird interjected, "So the being in the ruined temple outside Fengdu Mountain was a human immortal turned god?"

Guigu Lingguan nodded. "I knew of him. In his twilight years, he obtained a celestial stone, becoming one of the Nine Northern Gods. Alas, he perished in the great upheaval of Fengdu Mountain."

Yuan Zhengfeng added, "Even without the catastrophe, his lifespan would’ve ended. Pity his divine form was destroyed."

Li Zhengjing asked, "I heard that after the fall of the Great True Heaven in the Southern Wastes, human immortals from Central Plains sought his divine form. Did the Grand Preceptor of Great Zhou come north for the same purpose?"

Guigu Lingguan shook his head. "As time passes, flesh decays and souls wither. The Grand Preceptor’s body and soul had reached their limits—even with a divine form, he couldn’t endure."

"But I’ve heard celestial stones can gather mortal faith—incense—to nourish the soul and prolong its lifespan," Yuan Zhengfeng said.

"True, but incense has drawbacks. Mortal faith is chaotic, eroding the false god’s consciousness until they become unrecognizable," Guigu Lingguan replied. "Moreover, if incense ceases, the soul withers regardless."

Yuan Zhengfeng pressed, "What of changing bodies?"

Li Zhengjing clenched his fist behind his back, his expression grave. This might shed light on the creditor’s current state.

"Bodies?" Guigu Lingguan pondered, glancing at his own form. "One’s original body is most compatible with their power. Another’s body would cause rejection. Ideally, a human immortal’s power requires a human immortal’s body."

He raised his claw—a dragon’s limb. "Similarly, young Li could wield our half-dead friend’s power, but his body, lacking an immortal’s physique, nearly burst. Only the Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill saved him. Had I not gifted him the Blazing Fire Divine Ability to vent some power, he’d have exploded."

He added, "Human immortals rarely abandon their bodies for another’s. Even if they do, their souls still wither."

The group fell silent, their gazes fixed on him. 

Elder Xuji stepped back. "No wonder he covets my body—and the Divine Lord’s!"

The wall-perching bird fretted, "He’s already grafted wings. Does he want to be a bird? With my majestic looks, will he covet me next?"

Li Zhengjing eyed the jade fragment. "So changing bodies doesn’t grant immortality?"

Guigu Lingguan mused, "Celestial stones with incense can slow soul decay, granting false gods a second life, but they still die. Changing bodies may extend the flesh’s lifespan, but without celestial stones, the soul decays regardless—unless the soul is immortal, allowing endless body swaps."

Li Zhengjing fell silent. Yuan Zhengfeng, too, was lost in thought.

The creditor had existed for over two millennia—far beyond a human immortal’s lifespan. Had his soul achieved immortality? If so, why not remain in a celestial stone?

Guigu Lingguan eyed Li Zhengjing curiously. Elder Xuji charged ahead recklessly. The wall-perching bird remarked, "This path isn’t so tough. Why do ghosts and artificial soldiers only ascend via the Yellow Springs?"

"Keep going," Guigu Lingguan said grimly. "You’ll see."

Ten li later, a deafening roar erupted. A gale howled, carrying sinister energy. A colossal, murky eye glowed on the cliff, its pressure overwhelming even Elder Xuji.

Guigu Lingguan’s golden eyes pierced the illusion. Li Zhengjing gripped his Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Blade and the jade fragment. "What now?"

The usually boastful wall-perching bird hid in its phoenix tree box.

"The chief of the Nine Northern Gods—the Great Fengdu Deity!" Yuan Zhengfeng said gravely. "When the million demons emerged, the nine gods perished protecting mortals. Only Fengdu’s divine form remained intact. With his last power, he fused it into Fengdu Mountain, bolstering its seal."

The wall-perching bird peeked out. "Dead? Then what’s that eye?"

"His power is spent, but new souls can inhabit the form, creating a new god," Guigu Lingguan explained. "Countless souls, including human immortals, perished here. Their remnants became part of Fengdu."

Li Zhengjing thought, *A crowdfunded god?*

Guigu Lingguan added, "The divine form’s unyielding will and lingering incense bind any inhabiting soul to its duty—protecting the north."

Li Zhengjing met the eye—and the world turned crimson with killing intent. 

"Don’t look!" Guigu Lingguan warned. "Do you not recognize traces within it?"

Yuan Zhengfeng gasped. "Why does Fengdu’s eye bear the Ninth Helm Master’s power?"

Guigu Lingguan whispered, "Fengdu’s form is hidden within the mountain—indeed, the entire mountain is now his body. The Ninth Helm Master’s remnants became part of him. He’ll only act as Fengdu, but the helm master’s hatred remains. Provoke him, and that hatred may invoke divine retribution."

He added, puzzled, "But the hatred isn’t just for you?"

Elder Xuji covered his face with a scrap of cloth, dodging the eye’s gaze. "I didn’t mean to! You’d turned into a corpse king—I had to purify you! Look on the bright side—now you’re part of Fengdu! Isn’t that grand?"

The mountain trembled. Yin energy surged.

"Elder Xuji, apologize!" Guigu Lingguan urged.

"Never! Even alive, Fengdu didn’t scare me! Now he’s an empty shell—and the Divine Lord is here! I’ll teach him a lesson!" Elder Xuji charged into the cliff.

Moments later, he returned, composed—then knelt, offering fish, meat, eggs, wine, and incense. "Devotee Xuji humbly beseeches passage."

His back was a bloody mess—injuries even a human immortal couldn’t quickly heal.

The wall-perching bird muttered, "He got beaten into submission. Quite the act."

"Offerings must be made to pass," the mountain boomed.

"Earlier, the Ninth Helm Master was our offering," Yuan Zhengfeng realized.

Guigu Lingguan said, "We’re short. Young Li and his pets are weak. I’m only half-recovered. We’d need another human immortal—like him." He eyed Elder Xuji.

The wall-perching bird whispered, "Ditch him?"

Elder Xuji grumbled, "These were for the Divine Lord. A false god should be grateful."

Suddenly, the mountain declared, "Offerings sufficient."

The group exchanged glances. Only Elder Xuji rejoiced. "Fengdu knows quality! Let’s go!"

Li Zhengjing and Guigu Lingguan suspected interference but pressed on.

At the cliff’s edge, a chasm belched yin energy. 

"Below lies the source that toppled Fengdu Mountain," Guigu Lingguan said. "The seal, woven by the previous Feather Transformation Sect leader, lets yin energy and Yellow Springs water through but blocks demons. Only his token or the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison Art can open it."

Li Zhengjing understood. "No wonder all practitioners of that art died post-cataclysm."

"Now, only you can guide us through," Guigu Lingguan said.

Li Zhengjing checked the golden page—his death by Great Derivation Void-Transforming Sword Qi remained certain. He cleansed the jade, had the bird sterilize it with fire (eliciting Yuan Zhengfeng’s protests), swallowed it, shouldered the phoenix tree box, and let Guigu Lingguan grab him and Elder Xuji. They leaped into the abyss.

Half an hour later, a white-robed figure arrived—the Ancient Moon Peak Master. 

"Two helm masters’ power now part of Fengdu," he mused. "The ninth is dying. Three human immortals should suffice for passage."

The mountain rumbled. "Your cultivation is too high. Half an offering won’t suffice. Another is needed."

The peak master’s eyes narrowed. "Someone passed before me?" He stepped forward.

The mountain roared, "No offering—death awaits!"

"With all three helm masters dead, and living beings already passed, where would I find another?" The peak master drew his sword. "I honored you as protector of the north. Now, step aside—or become my offering."

Fengdu Mountain quaked. The Great Fengdu Deity raged.

"Good." The peak master advanced, his sword gleaming. "Ancient Moon Peak Master of Feather Transformation Sect challenges the Great Fengdu Deity!"

The mountain trembled under their clash.
