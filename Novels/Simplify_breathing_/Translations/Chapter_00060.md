# Chapter 60: The Killing Sword

Within the sprawling courtyards of the Xu family mansion, guards were on high alert, and the atmosphere was solemn. In the main hall, Xu Zaichuan's body lay in a coffin. Xu Wangliang stood by its side, his expression dark as he stared at the wound on his son's neck.

"What a swift sword, what a ruthless sword!"

A chilling remark escaped Xu Wangliang's lips, and the temperature in the room seemed to drop. The maids and servants in the hall held their breath, terrified of provoking Xu Wangliang in his current state.

"My lord, you must avenge our Chuan'er!" Xu Zaichuan's mother wailed loudly, her voice hoarse and piercing.

"Whoever dares to kill my son, they will not escape!"

Xu Wangliang turned to his butler. The butler quickly stepped forward and whispered, "My lord, I just gave orders to investigate the whereabouts of everyone who had a grievance with the young master today. If anyone's movements are suspicious, they will be immediately apprehended."

"Slap!"

Xu Wangliang slapped the butler across the face. The butler crashed into a pillar, spitting out a mouthful of blood. The butler looked at Xu Wangliang in horror, unsure what he had done wrong. The surrounding servants shivered and bowed their heads even lower.

"Anyone who has ever had a grievance with him, apprehend them all for questioning first, regardless of whether their whereabouts today were unusual." Xu Wangliang loomed over the butler and said grimly, "Also, anyone seen wandering near Chuan'er's mansion today, seize them all. Better to kill the wrong person than to let any suspicious one go. Do you understand?"

Cries and sounds of struggle occasionally echoed from various parts of the city, but they quickly subsided. The other noble families in Xingfen City tacitly approved of Xu Wangliang's actions. After all, his most beloved son had died. To step out and obstruct him at such a time would surely incur Xu Wangliang's immediate enmity. Furthermore, Xu Wangliang was famously vengeful in Xingfen City. Even if a misunderstanding occurred, there might be no immediate repercussions, but one never knew when Xu Wangliang might stab them in the back later. Some families weren't afraid, but they also didn't want to stir up such trouble.

By the next day, the Xu family began to search for outsiders within Xingfen City. Anyone using disguise was arrested and interrogated. Daring to use disguise indicated a suspicious mind. If one was suspicious, then they could explain themselves properly in the Xu family dungeon. However, there were truly too many outsiders in Xingfen City. For the Xu family to investigate them all one by one was too difficult and would create too many enemies. Not all outsiders were easy to bully; among them were quite a few genuine masters and powerful individuals. Consequently, after just two days, this large-scale search for outsiders gradually ceased. Investigations continued, but they could no longer be carried out so recklessly.

At the same time, those planning to leave the city or merchant caravans became key targets for searches. These caravans were also informed that if anyone joined them midway and was found suspicious, they could return and claim a large reward. Xingfen City hadn't been this tumultuous in many years, causing widespread panic. The streets and taverns had become significantly emptier.

Therefore, upon hearing Wu Changli's words, some people couldn't help but cry tears of joy; they could finally leave this place.

"You all seem very happy!"

Xu Wangliang was already somewhat disappointed, and seeing the change in expression of those in the dungeon only fueled his anger. His son had died, yet these people dared to be so happy. The people in the dungeon felt as if their throats had been squeezed, not daring to make another sound.

"There must still be some accomplices among them. Interrogate them thoroughly again. Those who deserve to die, kill them!"

Xu Wangliang tossed out these words, then turned and left the dungeon. Wu Changli instinctively drew back his neck and hurried after him. Wu Changli had heard that Xu Wangliang was volatile, but now he had witnessed it firsthand. Those in the dungeon had truly run into terrible luck by encountering Xu Wangliang. It could only be said that in this world, to live well, sometimes simply avoiding trouble wasn't enough.

"Patron Wu, can you track down the murderer of my son?"
