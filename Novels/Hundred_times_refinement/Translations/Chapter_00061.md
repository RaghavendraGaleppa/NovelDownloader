# Chapter 11: Mountain Guardian Spirit Beast

Lin Xuan continued his daily life with confidence, and time proved his deduction correct. Although Elder Yunhe was furious, there was still no progress in the search for Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan. Some rogue cultivators and minor sects had become suspects, leading to conflicts with Piaoyun Valley. Of course, these matters had nothing to do with Lin Xuan. Being a low-ranking disciple had its advantages—he could focus solely on his cultivation.

On the surface, Lin Xuan's life remained unchanged—diligent and hardworking, yet yielding little visible progress. In reality, he spent a portion of each day studying the mysterious blue light spots within his body.

Two weeks passed in the blink of an eye.

"It seems I need to consult some ancient texts to see if I can find any useful clues," Lin Xuan muttered to himself while lying in bed. Another option was to seek advice from the sect's elders, who were knowledgeable and might have answers.

Of course, that thought was merely a joke. Lin Xuan had already dismissed it. He understood the saying, "A common man's innocence is his crime when he possesses a treasure." If the elders discovered the benefits of the blue light spots, they would surely silence him and seize it by force.

Lin Xuan wasn't foolish enough to invite such a deadly disaster. Moreover, the matter of Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan might also come to light...

The blue light spots were his secret alone, and Lin Xuan was fully aware of this. He would rather spend more time slowly unraveling the mystery himself than risk exposing it to others.

With this decision made, Lin Xuan went to sleep, planning to search the ancient texts the next day.

Early the following morning, Lin Xuan arrived before a grand hall.

The hall, built against the mountainside, was majestic and imposing—it housed Piaoyun Valley's vast collection of books. Such an important place was not only located at the heart of the sect but also protected by numerous restrictions.

Guards were stationed every few steps, and various guardian spirit beasts patrolled the area.

Guardian spirit beasts were a type of demon beast, but unlike their wild counterparts, these creatures were either tamed by the sect's experts or raised within Piaoyun Valley itself.

In simple terms, they were domesticated beasts for cultivators.

However, one should never underestimate the power of spirit beasts. They could also harness the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, possessing abilities beyond ordinary imagination.

Moreover, spirit beasts were extremely loyal. Once they recognized a master, they would never betray them. In battle, they fought fearlessly. Thus, every cultivation sect kept spirit beasts to guard their territory.

"Roar!"

A deafening roar echoed through the mountains. Lin Xuan had barely approached within two hundred meters of the hall when he heard the intimidating growl. A flash of red light later, a massive, multicolored tiger appeared before him. Unlike ordinary beasts, this creature was entirely crimson, with faint flames flickering across its body. The surrounding grass began to burn even before the flames touched them.

The aura it exuded was incomparable to that of lions or tigers—a terrifying, overwhelming presence that sent chills down one's spine.

A Flaming Tiger—a lower-tier, first-grade demon beast!

Just as cultivators were divided into eight stages from Spirit Movement to Transcendence Tribulation, demon beasts were classified from first to eighth grade, with each grade further divided into lower, middle, upper, and peak tiers.

Spirit Movement stage corresponded to first-grade demon beasts, Foundation Establishment to second-grade, and so on...

Although their strength was comparable, cultivators of the same level were generally more formidable in battle. Demon beasts might harness spiritual energy, but they lacked intelligence, making them no match for cunning humans.

The Flaming Tiger was over three meters long, radiating an intimidating aura. Yet, Lin Xuan remained unfazed. It was just a mindless beast, after all. Moreover, even if he wasn't highly regarded in the sect, he was still a disciple of Piaoyun Valley.

The unique spiritual signatures of every sect disciple were imprinted onto the guardian spirit beasts through mystical techniques, allowing the beasts to distinguish between insiders and outsiders.

The Flaming Tiger approached Lin Xuan with a low growl. Lin Xuan remained calm. After scrutinizing him for a moment, the beast's hostility gradually faded. It wagged its tail and stepped aside, even nuzzling Lin Xuan's leg affectionately—clearly recognizing him as one of their own.

Passing through the checkpoint guarded by the Flaming Tiger, Lin Xuan arrived at the grand hall. He looked up at the imposing structure. The library had three floors. The first floor, open to all disciples, housed the largest collection—tens of thousands of books.

However, for cultivators, the books on the first floor held little value. None contained cultivation techniques, artifact-forging methods, or alchemy manuals. Those were stored on the second floor, accessible only to Foundation Establishment experts and above.

The second floor was also far more heavily guarded, with multiple layers of restrictions and patrolling elders.

As for the third floor, it housed the most precious treasures—the cultivation insights of past sect masters and Piaoyun Valley's most powerful techniques. Rumor had it that only those bearing the sect leader's token were permitted entry.

The third floor was guarded by reclusive, ancient monsters!

Books from the second and third floors were strictly forbidden to be taken out. Disciples could borrow up to three books from the first floor at a time. Recalling the library's rules, Lin Xuan began his search.

The first floor spanned thousands of square meters, with rows upon rows of neatly arranged bookshelves. Lin Xuan started from the leftmost section.

"Nine Suns of Tianshan Technique," "Profound Yin Scripture," "Sun-Moon Divine Palm," "Demon Sovereign's Tyrant Fist..."

One martial arts manual after another—supreme techniques revered by mortal martial artists. Yet, to cultivators, they held no appeal. No matter how refined one's martial skills were, they couldn't compare to magical treasures. These items were worthless here.

Shaking his head, Lin Xuan moved to another corner.

"Compendium of Herbs," "Thirteen Chapters of Divine Medicine," "Golden Needle Meridian Blocking..."

Titles of long-lost medical texts filled his vision, but they were equally useless to cultivators. The simplest pill could cure any mortal ailment.

A faint sneer tugged at Lin Xuan's lips as he scanned the titles. No wonder this floor was open to all. To cultivators, the first floor was filled with things that were "not worth eating but a pity to discard." It was touted as a benefit for Spirit Movement disciples, but in reality, it showed how little regard the sect had for low-ranking disciples—mere lip service.

The cultivation world truly followed the law of the jungle. To gain rights and respect, one needed strength. With this realization, Lin Xuan's determination to cultivate grew even stronger.
