# Chapter 452: Inside Cold Crow Pass

As the fleeing light approached the gates of Cold Crow Pass, dozens of blood-red patterns suddenly lit up on the city walls. They interwove and spread like a spider's web, instantly outlining a massive warning formation.

The formation patterns were as猩红 as blood, rippling with a faint glow in the dark night. They seemed calm, but concealed deadly traps within.

Xu Yunfan's gaze sharpened. With his current level of attainment in the Dao of Formations—nearing mastery of the "Initial Understanding of Formations"—he could see through its secrets at a glance. This formation was not merely for vigilance; it concealed three layers of changes.

If one were to rashly charge in, the first layer would activate the "Blood Fiend Soul Lock." The patterns would coil up like living things, sealing the cultivator's surrounding spiritual energy and turning the area into a dead zone devoid of spiritual power.

If one强行 broke free, the second layer, "Bone-Eroding Yin Lightning," would erupt from the formation's core. Thousands of lightning bolts, like venomous snakes, would bite and tear, specifically designed to break through protective auras.

And if one still managed to force their way through, the third layer, "Nine Nether Soul Refining," would启动. The blood light within the formation would transform into thousands of vengeful spirits, tearing at the soul until the intruder's spirit was shattered.

Such a vicious formation was certainly not for ordinary defense; it seemed specifically designed to guard against certain unspeakable existences.

Xu Yunfan secretly pondered that the Garrison Commander of Cold Crow Pass must have a difficult time.

Opportunity and danger coexist.

The red light reflected on Xu Yunfan's face, making his already pale complexion appear even more chilling.

He was well-prepared and calmly took out a green jade talisman from his chest. With a light flick of his finger, a strand of True Martial Power was infused into it, and the jade talisman immediately emitted a clear, misty aura.

The guarding formation sensed the Garrison Commander's token, and those ferocious blood patterns receded like the tide, finally opening a light gate just wide enough for one person to pass through on the thick玄铁 city gate.

"Quite an unique welcoming ceremony," Xu Yunfan muttered to himself as he stepped into the pass.

The oncoming Yin wind carried a piercing chill, causing even him, with his cultivation, to frown slightly.

A Foundation Establishment True Person had long since transcended the mortal body. Their flesh was tempered by spiritual energy, immune to heat and cold, and difficult to harm with fire or water. Even if placed in a sea of molten lava, they could stroll about leisurely.

Yet the Yin wind now assaulting him was bizarrely unusual. It was like thousands of fine needles piercing through his protective spiritual light, stabbing straight into the depths of his bone marrow. The chill was not like ordinary frost or snow; rather, it seemed like deathly energy seeping out from the depths of the Nine Nether Yellow Springs. Fine threads of it缠绕 his whole body, causing the true energy in his Dantian to stagnate slightly.

Xu Yunfan frowned, feeling a sense of gravity.

This Yin wind was definitely not formed naturally; it was likely the怨气 of the Nether River below the pass transformed into form.

He lightly formed a hand seal with his fingertips, and True Martial Power flowed around his body, slightly dispelling the chill.

Even so, the coldness remained like a附骨之疽 (bone-gnawing疽), impossible to shake off.

"Even a Foundation Establishment body finds it hard to resist... No wonder previous Garrison Commanders were unwilling to stay long," he muttered to himself, his gaze沉重ly looking towards the dark river below, his heart growing even more solemn.

要知道, Xu Yunfan had entered the Dao through martial arts. His muscles, bones, and skin had undergone countless temperings. In terms of physical strength alone, he was毫不逊色 to those body cultivators who focused solely on physical training.

Ordinary Yin evil or demonic qi, let alone invading his body, couldn't even approach within three feet of him before being scattered by the thick True Martial Gang Qi within him.

Yet now, this Yin wind surging up from the Nether River could actually make him feel a trace of chill seeping into his marrow, which was enough to show its extreme danger.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was like lightning as he slowly scanned the cultivators stationed inside the pass.

He saw that most of these cultivators had pale, bluish faces, with wisps of cold Yin energy lingering around them, clearly indicating they dealt with Netherworld energy all year round. Many of them had cold, green light in their eyes, and what they inhaled and exhaled was not ordinary spiritual energy, but Yin-cold true energy mixed with Nether River's煞气.

When they walked, their footsteps were silent, like wandering ghosts, obviously having cultivated Yin-attributed cultivation methods to a very high level.

By the city wall, several cultivators in dark black robes were sitting in meditation. Cold, white qi swirled around them, actually condensing a thin layer of frost on the ground. Xu Yunfan recognized at a glance that this was a characteristic of the "Nine Nether Profound Ice Art" reaching minor success.

This cultivation method required引幽冥寒气入体 (leading Netherworld cold qi into the body). Ordinary cultivators, if slightly careless, would have their meridians frozen to death. Those who could cultivate it successfully were all ruthless characters.

What concerned him most was that the Nine Nether Profound Ice Art was a cultivation method under the command of the Lord of the Nine Abyss Mysterious Fiend Cave, Ming Zhenjun.

By right, with their Qi Condensation cultivation, they should have found it impossible to move an inch in such a Yin-evil environment. But these disciples all looked normal; some even held Yin Soul Banners, absorbing the怨气 (resentful energy) drifting from the Nether River to cultivate.

One skinny youth was particularly eye-catching. He was only at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation, yet he dared to directly touch the blood-fiend patterns on the city wall, letting the Yin evil energy erode his arm without changing his expression.

"Interesting..."

Or one could say, as expected of demonic sect disciples. These people were ruthless to others, but even more ruthless to themselves.

Xu Yunfan secretly pondered.

These cultivators could thrive in such a dangerous environment. Either they were exceptionally talented, or they had been forced to develop a resilience far beyond their peers.

Either way, it showed that the defensive strength of Cold Crow Pass was far greater than it appeared on the surface.

Xu Yunfan's thoughts churned, and the corner of his mouth couldn't help but curl up slightly.

Although Cold Crow Pass was filled with Yin evil and situated at the border of three major sects, constantly at risk of being invaded, it also had its advantages.

Now, within the pass, he was the only Foundation Establishment True Person holding down the fort. Those Qi Condensation disciples, in the eyes of a Foundation Establishment True Person from the Primordial Sect, were nothing more than walking consumables.

The rules of the Primordial Sect had always been strict, with a hierarchy that was almost cruel. Those who had not entered Qi Condensation didn't even deserve the title of "cultivator"; they were merely raw materials raised by the sect. And even if they entered Qi Condensation, they were just slightly larger ants in front of a Foundation Establishment True Person.

Those Qi Condensation disciples who dealt with Yin evil all day probably didn't even have the courage to look him straight in the eye.

"Quite convenient for handling affairs..."

He narrowed his eyes, his gaze sweeping over those trembling Qi Condensation cultivators below the city.

Some of them didn't cultivate Yin-cold methods; under the erosion of the Nether River's Yin energy, their bodies had long since become emaciated, yet they still had to强撑着 to maintain the operation of the formation.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over those pale-faced Qi Condensation disciples.

These cultivators, nine out of ten, were pitiful wretches who had been harmed by the Primordial Sect's so-called "Cultivation Loans."

Within the Primordial Sect, low-level cultivators without backing who wanted to advance further?

It was simply a pipe dream.

The high and mighty deacons of the various peaks had long since calculated everything clearly.

Want pills?

Sure, sign a "Spiritual Pill Loan."

Want to learn cultivation methods?

Alright, the "Secret Transmission Loan" is waiting for you.

Even renting a decent cave dwelling for cultivation requires taking on a "Blessed Land Loan."

Which of these Qi Condensation disciples isn't crushed by their debts, with interest piling up?

Xu Yunfan could even tell at a glance which peak they owed their debts to. The one with the deathly pale face probably borrowed "Cold Marrow Peak's" Yin Evil Pills. The one with the distracted gaze likely signed the "Soul Refining Peak's" Heart-Eroding Contract. And those few trembling all over probably borrowed "Blood Fiend Peak's" high-interest loans and couldn't repay them, so they were sent to this ghostly place to work off their debt.
