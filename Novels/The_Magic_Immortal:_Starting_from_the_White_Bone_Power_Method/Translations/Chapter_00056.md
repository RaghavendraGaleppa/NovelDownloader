# Chapter 56: Mystic Clear Soul Bamboo Bell

This was Wang Chan's first time attending an auction, whether in his past life or current one. Unfamiliar with the procedures and methods, he could only observe and learn from others.

Holding a teapot, Wang Chan stood by the door of his private booth, watching the bidding through the faint glow of the protective formation. He noticed something peculiar—though the voices varied in volume, their tone and quality were remarkably similar, as if spoken by the same person. Clearly, the voices had been altered by some mechanism.

When someone in a booth spoke, sound waves would vibrate against the formation's barrier, causing it to emit a jade-like glow. This ingenious system ensured anonymity, preventing anyone from identifying bidders by their voices. The auctioneer, a bearded man on the stage, determined the speaker's location by observing which barrier lit up.

The first item auctioned was the Gale Shuttle, a dual-purpose artifact for both evasion and defense. Though it only had twenty-nine layers of restrictions, it was an excellent tool for escape and survival, much like the Water-Avoiding Shuttle. Given its utility and the auction setting, its price was expected to be high.

Soon, the Gale Shuttle was sold for 9,888 spirit coins to a cultivator in Booth 36—a premium of about 3,000 coins compared to standard mid-grade artifacts with similar restrictions.

A veiled woman in white, at the late Qi Refining stage, then carried a jade box from the stage to Booth 36. She produced a restriction token, cast a few spells, and a barrier identical to the booth's formation enveloped her. She stepped through the barrier effortlessly, delivering the item without ever breaking the formation's seal. This method ensured no outsiders could peek inside.

About half a cup of tea's time later, she emerged without the jade box but with a storage pouch—presumably containing the payment.

Several other rare and valuable items followed, all successfully auctioned. Wang Chan grew increasingly excited, especially for the five finale items, one of which was a mid-grade soul-type artifact that promised to be exceptional.

Half an hour later, the bearded auctioneer grinned and tapped a jade box. Twelve slender, colorful needles flew out, shimmering under the dim light of the auction hall, their beauty captivating.

As an expert in needle-based techniques, Wang Chan was immediately intrigued, even setting aside his tea.

The auctioneer cast twelve spells, each activating one of the needles. A series of clear chimes rang out as the needles glowed brilliantly, revealing seventy-two restriction layers each, swirling like tiny rainbows.

Wang Chan sighed and patted his nearly empty storage pouch, shaking his head ruefully.

"Ladies and gentlemen, one of our finale items—the Rainbow Needles, a set of twelve high-grade artifacts," the auctioneer announced. "The Rainbow restrictions are renowned for their speed and illusory effects." With a wave, he recalled the needles into the box and declared, "Starting bid: 30,000 spirit coins. Minimum increment: 1,000 coins!"

"31,000!" someone called out.

After a pause, another bid followed: "32,000!"

The price quickly climbed to 50,000, with only four bidders remaining—Booths 1, 3, 7, and 9. These early-numbered booths likely belonged to individuals of high status or cultivation.

High-grade artifacts typically started at 30,000 coins, with each additional restriction layer adding 300 coins. The Rainbow Needles, being a set of twelve, far exceeded the value of a standard high-grade artifact. Their rarity and the auction setting ensured the price wouldn't drop below 60,000.

Sure enough, the bidding soon reached 60,000, leaving only Booths 1 and 9 in contention. After a prolonged back-and-forth, Booth 9 offered 65,000, and Booth 1 withdrew.

Just as the auctioneer was about to finalize the sale, Booth 69 suddenly bid, "70,000!"

The crowd erupted in surprise, all eyes turning to Booth 69. Wang Chan, in Booth 96, was equally curious—he had initially wanted Booth 69 but couldn't secure it.

The auctioneer paused, glancing at Booth 9.

After a moment of silence, a voice from Booth 9 said, "Esteemed cultivator in Booth 69, I am Bai Song of the Bai family. These needles are vital to my cultivation path. I humbly request your concession."

The crowd murmured disapprovingly—Bai Song was shamelessly leveraging his family's influence.

"No," Booth 69 replied flatly.

"You'll regret this!" Bai Song spat venomously before falling silent, his threat hanging heavy in the air.

Bai Song was one of the Bai family's three most promising candidates to reach Foundation Establishment in the next decade. Before the Blackwater City cultivators migrated south, the Bai family had been the strongest force in the White Mountain region, second only to the White Mountain City's administration. It was clear Bai Song intended to settle the score after the auction.

The auctioneer, expressionless, set down his gavel and produced a silver token engraved with cloud patterns. It hovered mid-air, emitting silvery mist that coalesced into three characters: Guo Zhenshan.

"I am Guo Zhenshan, an inner disciple of the Misty Cloud Sect's Cloud Piercing Peak. My elder brother, Guo Zhenhai, is one of the thirty-six core disciples under the revered 'Raging Sea Great Perfected One,' whose name I dare not speak," Guo Zhenshan said calmly, staring at Booth 9.

"Oh, and Bai Song of the Bai family—have you heard of the Guo family of Four Directions Valley? The one ranked twelfth among the thirty-six Yin God Clans of the Misty Cloud Nation?"

The crowd gasped. No one had expected the unassuming auctioneer to have such formidable backing. The silver token was unmistakably a Misty Cloud Sect inner disciple's insignia.

Bai Song didn't dare respond.

"You threatened someone at my auction," Guo Zhenshan continued, feigning distress. "My superiors said if I botch this, I'll be sent back to tend pigs—a job I've already done for ten years. So, Bai Song, since you're so confident, why not step up and duel me? If you win, I'll cancel the auction and return to pig farming."

"I wouldn't dare!" Bai Song stammered. "I spoke out of turn. Please forgive me!"

Guo Zhenshan frowned. "What? Do I lack the authority to demand an apology?"

A bloody finger suddenly flew out from Booth 9, landing on the stage.

"Tsk. Don't be so reckless next time—it could cost you your life," Guo Zhenshan said dismissively before addressing the crowd. "Rest assured, after the auction, the Trading Hall will ensure everyone departs safely. No mishaps will occur."

The sight of Bai Song's severed finger and Guo Zhenshan's reassurance calmed the crowd. With a Yin God Perfected One backing him, his words carried weight.

Wang Chan relaxed, now confident he could bid for the soul artifact without fear of reprisal. He couldn't help but envy Guo Zhenshan's effortless dominance—a far cry from his own struggles as a lone cultivator.

Another half-hour passed.

Guo Zhenshan produced a cyan jade box and tapped it, releasing a streak of light that transformed into an ethereal green bell. A gentle flick sent ripples of soothing sound through the hall, cleansing listeners' minds of negativity and distractions.

"The second finale item: the Mystic Clear Soul Bamboo Bell, a mid-grade soul artifact," Guo Zhenshan announced. "Freshly forged with a single restriction layer, its frame is made of renowned Mystic Clear Soul Bamboo, paired with the Mystic Clear Soul Restriction. It emits soul-cleansing tones to nourish the spirit and ward off inner demons, while also defending against soul attacks."

He sighed. "Pity it's only mid-grade. At high-grade, it could headline even the Mystic Heaven Pavilion's auctions. Starting bid: 3,000 spirit coins. Minimum increment: 500."

The bidding began anew.
