Chapter 149: A Perfect Match, Autumn Moon's Jealousy

News of Wang Wu’s severed arm spread quickly through the Wubei Hall.

To prevent Xu Lifeng from causing further trouble and injuring other officers, Li Xian decided to close the Wubei Hall, granting everyone a four-day leave.

He mounted his horse and galloped back to the One Union Manor to request an audience with the Madam.

"The Madam is in seclusion. You may return," Autumn Moon blocked the entrance, arms crossed, looking down her nose at him with deliberate arrogance.

Li Xian pushed her aside and walked straight into the inner courtyard. Autumn Moon stomped her feet in fury. "You bastard! How dare you force your way in!"

"I am loyal to the Madam. Since she is in seclusion, I shall wait at the foot of the tower until she emerges. How is that forcing my way in?" Li Xian said.

"You!" Autumn Moon clenched her fists, seething with silent hatred. She missed Pang Long. That man was simple and honest, focused solely on his work and never a threat to her position.

Now this Li Xian, aside from being impressive outside, was highly favored by the Madam and incredibly close to her. It was common to see them practicing swordplay together in the courtyard—a handsome man and a beautiful woman, strikingly eye-catching.

Moreover, Autumn Moon had a gut feeling that the Madam seemed different somehow. She couldn't pinpoint exactly how, nor dared she speak of it.

Driven by envy, she hated Li Xian to the core. Taking advantage of the "privilege" of assisting the Madam's seclusion, she whispered many poisonous words: "Madam, Li Xian is so young. I sense his mind is unstable; he might harbor treacherous thoughts."

"Besides, Madam, you are as beautiful as a fairy, while this lad is young and vigorous. He must be thinking filthy things behind your back. Why not demote him to spare us the sight of such a lowly servant?"

She said many things along those lines.

The Madam only replied淡淡ly, "I have my own plans. Do not speak of it again."

In truth, Autumn Moon was like Guan Gong showing off a small sword—utterly embarrassing herself. In terms of scheming and calculating interests, how could she compare to the Madam?

Her little tricks were seen through instantly. The Madam only tolerated her because she was still useful.

In contrast, Li Xian was often punished. Every time he requested to see the Madam, he often came out injured.

Li Xian waited in vain for half the day.

Night fell.

Moonlight cast a veil-like shadow. The Madam descended the tower with light steps, followed by Autumn Moon holding an incense burner. Beside the Madam, she dared not act domineering.

Seeing Li Xian, the Madam turned her head. "Autumn Moon, go prepare the medicinal bath materials for me."

Autumn Moon bowed deeply, handed the incense burner to the Madam, and replied, "Yes." She walked away, only glancing back slightly after turning the corner. Seeing the Madam walking side by side with Li Xian, her jealousy flared even more.

She looked at Li Xian again. He had grown tall and strong. From the skinny, short, and weak boy when he first arrived at the manor, he was now full of vitality, tall, and handsome.

He was even half a head taller than the Madam.

Li Xian was neat and refreshing; the Madam was graceful and elegant. Seeing the two walking around the lake, despite the vast difference in status, there was an inexplicable harmony.

Autumn Moon suddenly thought: "I am the Madam's personal maid, yet I always feel I cannot truly融入 her. There is an invisible barrier, hard to break even if I try my best to please her. How can this guy cross it so easily? Why?"

Her thoughts raced, but she dared not delay the Madam's business. She hurried to gather the herbs and boil the medicinal bath.

Li Xian took the incense burner and carried it. Inside, strange incense burned, refreshing the mind and soothing the mood. However, carrying the burner meant enduring the heat.

Madam Wen walked slowly, hands clasped before her. Today she wore a light green robe with wide sleeves hanging to her knees.

Li Xian had lived two lives. In his previous life, he had over twenty years of experience, and combined with this life, his experience wasn't exactly vast. He hadn't seen many women, but he knew few could compare to the Madam's demeanor.

"State your business," Madam Wen said.

"Madam, I am here regarding the matter of Xu Lifeng," Li Xian said.

"Xu Lifeng?" Madam Wen recalled for a moment. "You mean that Xu family member?"

"I told you to kill him. If you cannot, it is a matter of your ability."

She said淡淡ly, "I will not help you. On the contrary... I have taught you multiple times, yet you cannot even kill a Xu family member. I should punish you."

"I am not here to ask for help," Li Xian said.

Madam Wen nodded.

The lake surface was vast. This inner lake was arranged by Madam Wen. When she felt bored or tired during seclusion, she would look at the lake to pass the time.

The fish, cranes, trees, and willows in the lake were arranged with infinite charm, pleasing to the eye no matter how long one looked.

They stopped under a willow tree.

Madam Wen sat on a stone bench, smoothing her sleeves. "Then what is it?"

"Madam, I just have some questions," Li Xian said.

"Speak," Madam Wen said.

[Eight Forms of Touching Clouds]
[Proficiency: 198/1000 (Proficient)]

Li Xian placed the incense burner on the ground and began massaging the Madam's shoulders. "I saw Xu Lifeng today. I exchanged blows with him."

"But what truly puzzles me is that before fighting Xu Lifeng, I kept hearing a strange sound. Jingle-jangle, like wind chimes, but not quite. It was very peculiar, and hearing it made me feel agitated."

"I wish to ask the Madam for an explanation."

Madam Wen let out a soft "Hmm?" and said, "Could it be that Xu Lifeng has touched the Second Realm of martial arts?"

"The sound you described is called 'Ethereal Melody.' It is one of the characteristics of the Second Realm."

"As the saying goes, ethereal melodies are not heard by mortals. This sound... only martial artists who have reached the Essence Consuming Realm can hear faintly. But it still affects those in the Mortal Shell realm."

Li Xian said gravely, "Is that truly the case!"

Madam Wen thought: "Since Xu Lifeng has touched the Second Realm, Li Xian is no match for him. How can one walk the path of martial arts without suffering setbacks? Let him take a fall. I will save him then and punish him severely."

In a moment, she had made her plan.

But she was also curious. Knowing Li Xian was clever and alert, perhaps he could bring an unexpected surprise?

She had no interest in this duel originally. Xu Lifeng had lost his hands and feet, his martial arts crippled by eighty percent. Li Xian, having entered the Essence Consuming Realm, would have no trouble taking him down. She had her own calculations; this arrangement had its reason. Now that an unexpected change had occurred, she became interested.

"I understand, Madam," Li Xian's eyes were firm, secretly formulating a plan.

"Do you already have a plan?" Madam Wen asked淡淡ly.

"Not exactly," Li Xian shook his head. "But since the Madam has commanded, I will risk my life to try."

Madam Wen's lips curled slightly, satisfied with this reply. "Since you have no plan, I will give you a hint. Ponder it yourself."

"Please speak, Madam," Li Xian said happily.

"Water," Madam Wen pinched a pebble and tossed it into the lake. With a plop, the stone sank.

"The path of martial arts, though one grows stronger. Sometimes, it is precisely because of this strength that new flaws arise."

"That is all I will say. If you cannot kill him, I will punish you."

By the end, Madam Wen's voice grew cold, her finger pointing at Li Xian's brow. This action seemed intimate but was actually a reprimand and a warning.

After Li Xian left, Madam Wen watched his retreating figure, a look of keen interest on her face.

How would he handle this situation?

Li Xian left the inner courtyard, pondering the Madam's hint.

He thought: "Is the Madam's hint profound, or just superficial? She said 'water' and mentioned that martial artists might have flaws. Does it mean... martial artists of the Second Realm fear water?"

Li Xian recalled the details and his eyes lit up. "The Madam threw a stone into the lake, and it sank. Does it mean... martial artists of the Second Realm cannot swim?"

He remained uncertain.

Even ordinary mortals, many are skilled swimmers. Martial artists seek the principles of heaven and earth, their bodies are extraordinary; how could they not know how to swim?

"Perhaps... it is precisely because某处 is too strong that they fear water. Regardless of whether this guess is right or wrong, I will just try it."

"I have the Blue Water Pearl; I definitely have the advantage in water."

Li Xian already had a plan. Time was of the essence. That night, he requested paper and brush. Utilizing the intent of the Four Directions Fist, he wrote a challenge letter.

The brushwork was vigorous and stable.

The challenge stated that four days later, he would fight Xu Lifeng by the Qingning Lake, to decide not only victory but also life and death.

The next day.

Li Xian arrived before the Leopard Blade Sect and shouted, "Xu Lifeng, come out quickly!"

Soon, Xu Lifeng, clad in a black robe, laughed sinisterly. "Brat, there is still time before the one-month deadline. Have you come to die?"

Li Xian said loudly, "Since it is a duel, there must be a challenge. Take this letter. Four days from now, all the experts of Qingning County will gather at Qingning Lake to watch the fight!"

He tossed the letter. Secretly channeling Qi, the paper became as sharp as a blade. Xu Lifeng waved his sleeve, caught the paper, opened it, and sneered, "Good... Hahaha, very good, very good. Four days, it shall be four days later."

"My Madam has given an order. Considering your relationship with the ancestors of the Xu family, if you defeat me four days later, you may kill me. The Madam will absolutely not pursue the matter," Li Xian said loudly.

"Truly?" Xu Lifeng激动ly asked, "Did the Madam really say that?!"

Li Xian sneered, "Do you think I dare fake the Madam's promise?"

"Yes, yes, even with ten times the courage, you wouldn't dare!" Xu Lifeng knelt towards the One Union Manor. "Thank the Madam for her mercy! Thank the Madam for her mercy!"

He then looked at Li Xian and sneered, "Brat, enjoy your final moments! Hahaha."

He shut the gate.

"Master, is the day of the duel approaching?" The fourth disciple, Yang Tong, lived in a room near the entrance. Hearing the commotion, he pushed open the window and asked.

Xu Lifeng laughed, "Yes, good disciple, your master doesn't have to die anymore."

"The Madam has agreed to spare us."

"Master!" Yang Tong was激动. Did this mean they had actually gained fortune from misfortune? He could receive the Master's true teachings!

"Good disciple, tonight I shall teach you the true essence of martial arts. Wait in your room, do not go out," Xu Lifeng laughed.

"Yes!"

Yang Tong was overjoyed. He returned to his room and sat upright. He only hoped for night to come quickly so he could glimpse the true essence of martial arts. Four days later, he could compare notes and fill in the gaps with his senior brothers!

"Li Xian's strength has grown quite fast. When I first saw him, he struggled to take a single palm from me. Yesterday when we exchanged blows, I felt his power was immense; I cannot underestimate him!"

"Yang Tong, that kid, saved my life in a way. Keeping him until today is me being仁至义尽. Tonight, I will drink his blood, go into seclusion for a few days to practice that martial art..."

"Four days later, I will twist off Li Xian's head, then go apologize to the Madam. From then on, the grudge will be settled, and I... can still achieve great things!"

Xu Lifeng calculated in his heart.

Night fell...

He followed his plan, knocked on Yang Tong's door, struck ruthlessly, and personally beheaded his disciple. He drank the blood to nourish the Blood Fungus Ginseng within him.

Threads of heaven and earth essence nourished him.

He digested it.

He immediately sat in meditation right there, practicing the "Blood Rakshasa Art." It was a mid-tier martial art obtained from the Blood Wing Demon Cult, along with the Blood Fungus Ginseng.

He found this evil art strange and had never dared to practice it recklessly.

Forced into a desperate situation with his meridians shattered, he had no choice but to survive using the Blood Fungus Ginseng. Later, he remembered this martial art and found it perfectly suited to his current state.

He began practicing.

His progress was rapid every day.

He eagerly anticipated the duel four days later, focusing on improving his strength as quickly as possible to ensure nothing went wrong.

He never imagined that at this very moment, Li Xian had already sneaked into the Leopard Blade Sect.

The "four-day agreement," the "begging for mercy," the delivery of the challenge letter... everything he did during the day was a deliberate deception.

To make Xu Lifeng focus solely on preparing for the duel four days later.

Li Xian did the opposite, launching a surprise attack tonight to seize the initiative!
