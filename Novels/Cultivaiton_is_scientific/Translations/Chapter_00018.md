# Chapter 18: Autumn Examinations

Li Shiming rode in an ordinary carriage, with the coachman and his young servant Mo Yan seated at the front, while Si Qin inside repeatedly checked the items in the examination basket, afraid something might be missing.

He hadn't wanted to bring Si Qin along, but she had insisted on coming. Considering she had spent days preparing for the autumn examinations, he finally relented. Several guards from the mansion followed at a distance—standard protocol whenever Li Shiming went out.

Despite several major incidents occurring recently in Nanling Prefecture, today's lively atmosphere remained unaffected. The main road was crowded with people—not just examination candidates and their families, but also many onlookers. The streets were patrolled by additional constables and prefectural soldiers to prevent any incidents.

"Young Master, we've arrived at the Examination Hall!" Mo Yan called from outside the carriage.

"Si Qin, stay in the carriage—don't come down," Li Shiming instructed, stopping her as she moved to exit. The area outside the Examination Hall was packed with people, with children even perched on low walls and trees. Many brought their children hoping they might absorb some scholarly aura, aspiring for them to one day take the examinations like these xiucai (scholars).

To ordinary folk, any xiucai qualified to take the autumn examinations was akin to a reincarnation of the Literary Star. This wasn't surprising—each xiucai had ranked among the top in their local examinations, making them veritable celestial scholars in their hometowns. And if one passed the autumn examinations, they would no longer be called xiucai but juren (elevated scholars), gaining eligibility for official positions.

Carrying his examination basket, Li Shiming approached the main gate. Several familiar xiucai exchanged glances but didn't greet each other. The soldiers conducting searches at the entrance weren't from Nanling Prefecture but had been transferred from elsewhere. Unfamiliar with Li Shiming, they searched him as thoroughly as any other candidate.

The Great Xia dynasty placed great importance on imperial examinations. Cheating was punishable by death, and due to the exams' significance, multiple measures were implemented to prevent misconduct. Even as the prefect's son, Li Shiming received no special treatment during the Nanling autumn examinations.

Watching the soldiers crumble the pastries Si Qin had carefully prepared pained him—fortunately, she couldn't see it, or she would have been heartbroken. After the search, a soldier escorted him into the Examination Hall. His assigned examination cell wasn't the best location among the rows of cubicles, but at least it wasn't near the latrines.

From his basket, he retrieved brushes, ink, an inkstone, and a paperweight, mixing ink with a little water. Thanks to his spatial storage, he effectively carried all the books from his study in his mind. Combined with the computational power of his IBM z15 mainframe and his knowledge of exceptional essays from his past life, he was well-prepared.

Moreover, having reached the first layer of Qi Refining, the nourishing effects of spiritual energy had significantly enhanced his memory, analysis, and calculation abilities—he had no worries about the examinations.

On the first day, the test covered textual analysis (tiejing). Though he had studied the Four Books and Five Classics, he had previously observed ancient examinations with detachment. Now actually participating, he realized how challenging they were—not for his current self, but compared to students from his previous life.

The simplest tiejing questions involved filling in blanks from randomly selected passages across the 170,000 characters of the Four Books and Five Classics, requiring complete memorization. Li Shiming scanned the questions, and the answers surfaced in his mind without needing the IBM z15. His only concern was writing clearly without smudging the paper.

Completing the entire day's fill-in-the-blank test took him just over an hour. Realizing he'd finished too quickly—the exam was designed to last all day—he heard other candidates groaning before soldiers silenced them.

As night fell, lanterns were lit, and candidates in their cells ignited oil lamps. Li Shiming sat on the simple wooden bed, took out the Spirit Gathering Plate from his spatial storage, and began practicing the Five Elements Absorption Technique. Even the autumn examinations couldn't interrupt his cultivation.

He had no choice—the four glowing stones on the Spirit Gathering Plate had dimmed considerably and wouldn't last much longer. Wasting any cultivation opportunity would be a tremendous loss. Besides, no one would disturb candidates in their cells unless they were caught cheating.

Spiritual energy flowed into his body, channeling through his opened meridians into the swirling vortex of qi. Reaching a critical point, the vortex contracted before expanding—he had broken through to the second layer of Qi Refining.

An inexplicable wind swept through the Examination Hall, making lanterns sway wildly as soldiers hurried to investigate. Finding nothing amiss, they attributed it to the weather.

Opening his eyes, a glint flashed in Li Shiming's gaze before fading. "Finally, the second layer of Qi Refining!" he rejoiced inwardly. Now he could begin learning spells, truly stepping onto the path of immortal cultivation.

Storing the Spirit Gathering Plate back in his spatial storage without wasting a moment, he estimated it would last only three more days. After that, his cultivation conditions would deteriorate. As for the glowing stones, he hadn't found any leads in Nanling Prefecture—and even if he did, he lacked the method to reactivate the plate.

Lying on the wooden bed, he spent his first night in the examination cell.

The second day tested classical interpretation (jingyi), with unusually obscure questions. Frequent sighs from other cells revealed their difficulty. However, no matter how esoteric, the questions couldn't deviate from the Li family's annotated classics. Over generations, their interpretations had expanded the original 170,000 characters into over six million words of commentary—every passage had been exhaustively analyzed.

The third day's policy essay (celun) assessed literary skill and practical application of classical knowledge. Instead of composing his own, Li Shiming selected an outstanding historical essay from the IBM z15's database that matched the examiner's preferences. This time, he waited an hour before starting.

At dusk on the third day, the autumn examinations concluded. Si Qin stood on the carriage, eyes fixed on the Examination Hall's gate. Candidates emerged exhausted, their energy spent after three grueling days. Some needed soldiers' support to walk out. Every year after the exams, many fell seriously ill—some never recovered.

"Young Master is coming out!" Mo Yan exclaimed excitedly. Indeed, the youngest candidate—and the only one still energetic—was unmistakable among the crowd. Si Qin waved vigorously from the carriage to catch his attention.
