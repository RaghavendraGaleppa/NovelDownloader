# Chapter 209: Thirty-Eight, You Shall Attend the Immortal Welcome Banquet on My Behalf

"Haha, judging by your expression, Junior Brother, your gains this time must be substantial."

The moment Zhang Jing stepped out of the bronze palace, Feng Wuyu's teasing voice drifted over from not far away.

"It's alright, alright," he chuckled. These gains were more than just 'not bad'; they were an enormous windfall.

"Fifth Junior Brother, congratulations on becoming Master's disciple." From the other side, Senior Sister Kong, dressed in a goose-yellow palace gown, smiled and nodded at Zhang Jing. "Regarding the Immortal Welcome Banquet, it was the junior brothers below who were too arrogant and ignorant. I hope Fifth Junior Brother won't take it to heart. When the time comes, I, your Senior Sister, will certainly give you an explanation."

With that said, Senior Sister Kong turned directly and walked down the mountain along the white jade steps. In just a moment, her figure vanished from sight.

Standing there, Zhang Jing was slightly stunned. This Senior Sister Kong had inexplicably said a lot, talking about ignorant junior brothers and giving an explanation. Yet, after saying it all, she didn't even provide an explanation. He couldn't help but look blankly at Senior Brother Feng Wuyu beside him:

"Senior Brother, what exactly did Senior Sister Kong mean? And this 'Fifth Junior Brother'... I remember our sect has eight True Inheritors, doesn't it?"

Facing Zhang Jing, Feng Wuyu smiled faintly, then patiently explained: "Let's talk about the Immortal Welcome Banquet first. Junior Brother, I remember you received an invitation before you came to the Ancestral Court, didn't you? As far as I know, this so-called Immortal Welcome Banquet is ostensibly an exchange meeting between the Nine Regions lineage from the lower realm and the Heavenly Realm lineage of the Scarlet Bright Vast Sky Grotto-heaven, but in reality—"

He seemed to recall something amusing. Feng Wuyu sneered: "In reality, it's just those few Nascent Soul realm cultivators from the Heavenly Realm lineage who want to use this opportunity to give Junior Brother a warning, thereby intimidating the other disciples from the Nine Regions lineage. After all, Junior Brother has just returned with the title of first place in the Foundation Establishment realm from the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, and your momentum is strong."

Upon hearing this, Zhang Jing suddenly understood. "Killing a chicken to warn the monkeys?"

Feng Wuyu nodded, then continued: "As for 'Fifth Junior Brother'—Junior Brother, you don't think that simply being a True Inheritor automatically qualifies one as Master's formal personal disciple, do you? In fact, before today, our Scarlet Bright Vast Sky Grotto-heaven had a total of eight True Inheritors. Among them, only four were Master's formal personal disciples, while the remaining four were registered disciples. Moreover, among those four personal disciples, only I, your Senior Brother, came from the Lower Realm's Nine Regions."

As he spoke, Feng Wuyu's voice suddenly became a little low. However, the next moment, his tone became high-spirited again. "But now we have you, Junior Brother, haha!"

After hearing this, "There are only four personal disciples in total? And two more..." A pensive expression appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

As the two spoke, "Dong—"

A deafening bell chime suddenly rang out from higher up Jade Splendor Mountain, transparent sound waves rapidly spreading in all directions.

"Junior Brother, this is the Eight Desolations Bell, a Daoist innate spirit treasure. This bell chime will spread throughout the entire Pure Sky Profound Brightness, signifying that the Daoist sect has gained another True Inheritor." Feng Wuyu glanced towards where the bell chime originated, then explained.

"As expected, there are innate spirit treasures!" Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed. Just now, when Martial Uncle Ming You gifted him the low-grade acquired spirit treasure, the Profound Nether Black Water Banner, he had already suspected the existence of innate spirit treasures. He hadn't expected to discover the traces of a so-called 'innate spirit treasure' right after stepping out of this bronze immortal palace.

Collecting himself, "So that's how it is. Thank you, Senior Brother, for clearing my doubts." Zhang Jing turned to look at Senior Brother Feng Wuyu, a hint of gratitude in his voice.

"No need to be so polite, Junior Brother. You and I both come from the Nine Regions of the lower realm, and we are both Master's formal personal disciples. From now on, we must support each other." Feng Wuyu's voice held a rare trace of seriousness.

"Junior Brother understands."

...

In a certain land of spiritual beauty and extraordinary splendor in the East Continent, hundreds of cultivators from three different factions, wearing various Daoist robes and dharma attire, each with distinct mana auras, were in a tense standoff, the atmosphere charged with extreme tension. Most of these individuals were at the Foundation Establishment realm. A few Golden Core realm cultivators stood casually behind the crowd, their expressions calm with a hint of arrogance.

In the distance, many cultivators gathered, softly debating which side would win the final victory. Some cultivators had even opened a betting pool, attracting many to place heavy wagers.

Among the crowd, a white-haired elder watched the scene in the distance. He couldn't help but lament in his heart: "This Spirit Pivot Mountain truly is a good place. Its thirty-six peaks subtly form a natural grand array, each peak exceptionally perilous and wondrous, with countless spiritual plants and rare beasts. Especially the main peak, which gathers the essence of hundreds of thousands of miles of earth veins and is adjacent to a Daoist blessed land."

As he pondered, among the three factions in standoff, a handsome young man, who appeared extremely youthful yet whose cultivation had clearly reached the Golden Core realm, suddenly stepped forward, and a magnificent aura instantly swept in all directions.

"Everyone, regarding the ownership of this Spirit Pivot Mountain, cultivators from our Yu River Sect, Three Origins City, and Dragon霄Sword Sect have been contending for hundreds of years. Let's decide the outcome today!"

"The victorious sect will directly apply to the Grand Unity Pavilion, while the other two parties must absolutely not obstruct or interfere for any reason. How about it?"

"Alright, then we'll do as you say! Let's have a fight first." A man as sturdy as a mountain also stepped forward, roaring with full battle intent.

Just as the battle among the three sides was about to erupt, "Dong!" A mighty bell chime suddenly swept across. The sound wave enveloped an endless storm of immortal spiritual energy, its momentum incomparably grand, yet it harmed no one, not even a blade of grass or a single tree was damaged in the slightest. It was as if a brief illusion. However, no one present believed it to be an illusion. Simply because...

"The Immortal Dao Sect has produced another True Inheritor?!" Someone exclaimed in a lost voice.

Whoosh— The crowd instantly erupted, and in a flash, no one paid any more attention to the dispute between the three factions.

...

Scarlet Bright Vast Sky Grotto-heaven. A certain immortal island cave mansion.

A group of dozens of people gathered in the spacious reception hall, seemingly discussing something, each with an expression of extreme confidence on their faces. Among them, the nine Nascent Soul realm cultivators in the center were faintly in the lead. Qing Fang, who had previously delivered the invitation to Zhang Jing, was among these nine.

...

"Haha, then let's do it this way. This will certainly make those from the Nine Regions lineage in the lower realm behave for a while." Qing Fang said with a laugh, his words filled with pleasure.

"That's excellent."

"We just need to thoroughly crush their arrogance!"

"Indeed! All cultivation resources belong to our Heavenly Realm; what do they have to do with them? Those beggars from the lower realm should act like beggars. It's good enough they get something to eat; what sense does it make for them to always want a seat at the table?"

"Oh, right! Everyone, quiet down, I have good news!" Suddenly, the handsome man in the very center, dressed in a moon-white dharma robe and possessing a noble demeanor, spoke with a smile. The reception hall immediately fell silent. "At this Immortal Welcome Banquet, Grand Senior Sister will also be attending. With her backing, even Senior Brother Feng Wuyu, whom we've always been concerned about, won't be able to stir up any trouble this time."

As the man's words fell, "What?! Senior Brother, are you saying Grand Senior Sister will also be coming?" Someone exclaimed in surprise. Their voice was filled with disbelief. After all, how could such a minor matter attract Grand Senior Sister's attention?

But at this moment, "Dong!" A prolonged, resonant bell chime instantly passed through the reception hall, then quickly faded away.

Not long after, "Gulp!" Someone swallowed, muttering: "Another Senior Brother or Senior Sister has achieved the True Inheritor position? I just wonder which grotto-heaven they are from."

In the furthest corner of the room, an ordinary-looking man slowly opened his eyes, a trace of unease flashing in his dark pupils. He didn't know why, but he always felt that Senior Brother Feng Wuyu's frequent appearances in recent months, Grand Senior Sister's presence, and the proactive participation in the Immortal Welcome Banquet, along with other strange behaviors, all had some intricate connection to the Senior Brother who had just become a True Inheritor. He wanted to say something, but when he looked up, the fervent and confident expressions on the faces of everyone in the room immediately met his eyes.

"Alas~ I hope I'm wrong." The man sighed inwardly, feeling helpless.

...

Time flowed slowly. Inside the cultivation chamber, Zhang Jing sat upright, seemingly thinking of something, and a hint of excitement flashed in his eyes. He extended one hand. A flash of light appeared. A peculiar immortal crystal suddenly appeared in his palm, emitting wisps of an ancient origin aura. Accompanying the appearance of this immortal crystal, Zhang Jing could clearly feel the mysterious jade talisman within his Niwan Palace beginning to tremble once again.

His gaze instinctively fell upon his palm. "Origin Crystal? What exactly are you, to be able to attract the jade talisman?" he mused inwardly.

After a moment of thought, he didn't hesitate in the slightest. Zhang Jing followed the subtle, perhaps even the jade talisman's, guidance and directly pressed the Origin Crystal in his hand against his brow. In an instant, he perceived an extremely vast and terrifying power within this Origin Crystal, a power akin to primordial chaos.

"Taiyi, or perhaps primal creation?" Zhang Jing mused thoughtfully. Other than these two terms, he truly couldn't think of anything else that could describe this power.

The next moment, within his Niwan Palace, the jade talisman burst forth with brilliant light! The power within the Origin Crystal began to be slowly extracted.

Two days later, Zhang Jing put away the Origin Crystal. The origin power lost from the crystal was only about one-thousandth. And this was the result of his continuous effort for two days and two nights.

"It's too slow, or rather, the power within it is too advanced, and the jade talisman is temporarily limited by my cultivation, so it can only extract it little by little." Zhang Jing thought. Immediately, his mind turned to the Niwan Palace. At this moment, a new column had appeared out of nowhere on the jade talisman.

`[Universal: 1.97 million]`

"Universal? Does that mean universal experience?" Zhang Jing wondered curiously. His mind instantly focused on the Universal Experience column.

The next moment, a clear perception suddenly appeared in Zhang Jing's mind. He could control these 1.97 million universal experience points, and not only could he add them to skills, but he could even add them to Dharma Seeds and Immortal Seeds, even if they didn't display experience values.

Furthermore—he could directly add them to the jade talisman itself!

Zhang Jing's eyes widened involuntarily. "Does this mean that the universal experience originating from the Origin Crystal can directly strengthen a Dharma Seed or Immortal Seed indefinitely? And what would happen if I kept adding it to the jade talisman?"

...

Unconsciously, six months quietly passed. Zhang Jing examined the three River of Time Golden Crystals in his hand, a hint of anticipation flashing in his eyes. "This should allow my Twenty-Four Heavens skill to level up by two more ranks."

He was just about to cultivate. However, the next moment, Zhang Jing seemed to realize something, and an invitation suddenly appeared in his hand. "Is it time for the Immortal Welcome Banquet?"

Not long after, "Thirty-Eight, you'll go to this Immortal Welcome Banquet on my behalf. Remember, we don't actively seek trouble, but we are absolutely not afraid of it either." Zhang Jing handed the invitation to Lu Thirty-Eight, while simultaneously instructing him. At the same time, a Dao seal, glowing with brilliant purple radiance, slowly emerged from his brow. Then, a wisp of aura was drawn out by Zhang Jing from within it, directly entering Lu Thirty-Eight's large forehead. It transformed into a purple chaotic Dao seal, identical to the one on his own brow.

A few breaths later, the Dao seal slowly faded away.

"Please rest assured, Master. I definitely won't disgrace you!" Lu Thirty-Eight novelty touched his own forehead, then patted his chest and vowed.

"Then go." Zhang Jing waved his hand.

Lu Thirty-Eight suddenly transformed into a streak of light and vanished from the immortal island.
