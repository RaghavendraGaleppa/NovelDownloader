# Chapter 76: Techniques (Happy Children's Day!)

Next came the selection of a combat technique. Li Shiming already possessed the "Dragon's Eye Technique," so he wanted to choose a sword technique to give himself real combat power beyond just talismans.  

He couldn't always rely on clever tricks—even the Azure Kite Wooden Sword, a top-grade magical artifact, had merely been thrown using its inherent abilities. If he could pair the sword with a proper sword technique, its effectiveness would naturally be far greater.  

"Senior Brother Liu, I'd like to ask for another favor. I want to select a sword technique—the more expensive, the better!" Li Shiming took out five spirit stones and placed them before Senior Brother Liu.  

"Junior Brother Li, you're too kind!" Having seen Li Shiming's identity jade slip, Senior Brother Liu's tone became noticeably warmer as he pocketed the spirit stones without hesitation.  

Li Shiming's lips twitched slightly. Senior Brother Liu's words might have been friendly, but his hands moved with swift efficiency.  

He had no real understanding of sword techniques, but choosing the most expensive one couldn't be wrong. If he missed this free opportunity, he'd have to purchase techniques himself later—and he had no idea how much they would cost.  

"For Qi Refinement cultivators, the most expensive sword technique is undoubtedly the *Sword Control Art*. It's priced so high because it's the strongest sword technique for sword cultivators at the Qi Refinement stage—unmatched. The sect sells it for 3,500 virtue points!" Senior Brother Liu provided the answer.  

"Senior Brother Liu, how does one obtain virtue points, and how much are they worth?" Li Shiming asked, hearing the term for the first time.  

"Virtue points are earned by completing sect missions. They cannot be bought or sold. Just know that even a mission offering 100 virtue points per month is fiercely contested among disciples. That should give you an idea of how expensive the *Sword Control Art* is!" Senior Brother Liu answered readily.  

"Then I'll trouble you again, Senior Brother Liu. I choose this *Sword Control Art*!" Li Shiming declared immediately.  

The sect likely hadn't anticipated that a newcomer would choose such an expensive technique when setting up the reward. They probably expected him to pick an ordinary technique.  

Who would have thought that Li Shiming would spend a few spirit stones to secure Senior Brother Liu's assistance?  

A small expenditure had earned him returns thousands of times greater.  

Soon, the jade slip for the *Sword Control Art* was prepared and handed to him.  

"Remember, the technique in the jade slip will automatically erase after one month. During this time, you cannot leave the sect—though you wouldn't be able to anyway. Still, the rules must be made clear," Senior Brother Liu reminded him.  

Li Shiming understood the sect's measures to prevent technique leaks. If techniques were spread freely, the sect would lose its competitive edge.  

With two jade slips in hand, he was about to leave under Senior Brother Liu's smiling farewell when two fellow newcomers—Jin Fengzhi and another female disciple—entered the Technique Repository.  

---  

Li Shiming noticed how Senior Brother Liu's warm smile toward him instantly reverted to the same lazy indifference as before when he turned to the newcomers.  

"Identity jade slip. What technique do you want?"  

The same question, the same tone, the same attitude.  

Li Shiming quickened his pace and left the Technique Repository. Senior Brother Liu's acting skills were truly profound.  

This time, he didn't take the paper crane. The distance was short, and walking felt different from riding the crane—he wanted to experience it firsthand.  

Back at Clear Autumn Pavilion, Senior Brother Zhuji was still occupied.  

Not wanting to disturb him, Li Shiming headed upstairs to the second floor.  

A row of wooden doors lined the hallway. He found the one with his assigned number.  

His identity jade slip unlocked the door.  

The room was tiny—barely large enough for a bed—with an attached washroom.  

However, there was no bed inside, only a lone meditation cushion on the floor, which ironically made the space feel slightly less cramped.  

He stepped into the washroom, where a stone basin continuously filled and drained water from above and below.  

The basin provided water for washing—cold only, for both face and body.  

The flow was sufficient for one person's needs.  

This setup was only because Clear Autumn Pavilion housed mortals. Normal cultivators wouldn't need such facilities—their sect-issued robes contained cleansing spells activated by spiritual energy, eliminating the need for washing.  

What pleased Li Shiming most was that his identity jade slip could activate an isolation array for his room, sealing it off from the outside.  

Once activated, all external sounds vanished. The sudden silence felt almost unsettling.  

His senses were extraordinarily sharp—he could hear even the faintest noises.  

Now, all he heard were his own heartbeat, the flow of blood through his veins, and the sound of air entering and leaving his lungs.  

Eagerly, he took out the *Vajra Armor Divine Art* jade slip and pressed it to his forehead. A flood of information poured into his mind.  

Simultaneously, a document titled *Vajra Armor Divine Art* appeared in his IBMz15, recording all the contents of the jade slip.  

He read the document ten times in succession—a process that took only ten seconds—and memorized the entire technique.  

A cultivator's memory was terrifyingly strong. Even the slowest learner could fully memorize such a vast amount of information within a month.  

Li Shiming had simply accelerated the process using his IBMz15.  

The *Vajra Armor Divine Art* was indeed difficult to master. This body-refining technique required igniting the fury of inner energy. When rage reached its peak, the body would enter a state of enhanced power beyond its normal limits.  

Yet, while in this state, one had to maintain a clear mind and methodically follow the technique's steps to strengthen the body layer by layer—from skin to bone.  

This technique was highly prone to qi deviation. Unstable focus could cause spiritual energy to run wild during enhancement, leading to severe injuries or even death.  

Physical damage was the best-case scenario—mental damage was far more disastrous.  

The *Vajra Armor Divine Art*'s "Vajra Wrath" state required coexisting fury and clarity, which demanded Buddhist cultivation as support.  

Though the initial stages of the technique didn't require medicinal resources, the later stages demanded an extensive list of rare herbs.  

Li Shiming felt a headache coming on just looking at the long list of ingredients.  

What he didn't realize was that *all* body-refining techniques were extremely resource-intensive.  

The scarcity of body-refining cultivators stemmed largely from this very reason.  

Even the *Bronze Body Technique* required poisonous substances—any spirit-infused toxin was exorbitantly expensive, often impossible to buy even with ample spirit stones.  

Unknowingly, Li Shiming had chosen the most arduous path for himself.
