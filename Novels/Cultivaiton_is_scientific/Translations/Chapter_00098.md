# Chapter 98 Gossip  

"Hmm, isn't that Fairy Yin?" Qiu Tan inwardly exclaimed as he approached Eagle Beak Island, spotting the emerald-green flying boat and the graceful figure standing atop it.  

Fairy Yin held an extremely high status within the sect, ranking among the strongest of the younger generation and considered one of the sect's top geniuses.  

Not only that, she was also a revered intermediate-level formation master—a rarity in the sect, with the number of formation masters countable on one hand.  

How could such a prodigy have come to Eagle Beak Island? What connection did Fairy Yin have with Li Shiming?  

At this moment, Qiu Tan's gossip-fueled curiosity burned fiercely. One was the sect's top genius, a breathtakingly beautiful fairy, while the other was a newly recruited disciple with nothing more than the identity of a low-level spiritual farmer.  

The two were like heaven and earth—how could they possibly know each other?  

Driven by intense curiosity, Qiu Tan kicked the white bird beneath him, urging it to fly faster.  

The white bird had long been discontented, having endured considerable hardship during this flight. The kick made it shudder, nearly throwing Qiu Tan into the sea.  

"Sorry, sorry! I'll treat you to your favorite silver-threaded fish when we get back!" Qiu Tan immediately realized his mistake and begged for mercy.  

The white bird steadied itself, granting him some face.  

When Qiu Tan looked up again, he saw the emerald-green flying boat had already departed, with Li Shiming still gazing at its distant silhouette.  

Only after the flying boat disappeared did Li Shiming turn to return to his cave abode.  

"Brother Li, wait for me!" Qiu Tan's voice called out.  

Li Shiming turned to see Qiu Tan approaching on his white bird, carrying a massive wooden crate on its back.  

He opened the island's formation, allowing the white bird to land.  

"Brother Qiu, did you bring everything?" Li Shiming asked with a smile, eyeing the large crate.  

"Brother Li, not only are the formation materials and metals here, but I also brought the three spiritual herbs you requested!" Qiu Tan carefully placed the crate on the ground, a hint of pride in his voice.  

His gaze scrutinized Li Shiming with keen interest, immediately noticing his unusually good mood.  

Well, of course—who wouldn't be in high spirits after meeting the most beautiful fairy in the Heavenly Sea Sect? If other sect members found out, they'd be green with envy. Even Qiu Tan himself couldn't help but feel a mix of admiration and jealousy.  

But envy was one thing; he knew full well the vast gap between himself and Fairy Yin. A prodigy like her wouldn't spare him a second glance.  

He desperately wanted to ask Li Shiming how he had met Fairy Yin, but broaching such a topic might cost him this valuable client.  

For the sake of spirit stones, Fairy Yin and gossip no longer mattered.  

"Brother Qiu, you've worked hard. How many spirit stones do I owe you?" Li Shiming bowed slightly in gratitude.  

"You're in luck—the three spiritual herbs only cost 1,500 spirit stones, averaging 500 per herb. Including the formation materials and metals, another 300 spirit stones will cover it!" Qiu Tan replied promptly, never careless in business matters.  

He had certainly made a tidy profit, but he knew better than to gouge his clients.  

The secret to his shop's success lay in his principles—every transaction adhered to fairness, earning him long-term partnerships with most of his customers.  

Li Shiming handed over the spirit stones, and Qiu Tan accepted them before opening the crate and pouring out a large quantity of metal.  

"Is this a spatial storage item?" Li Shiming asked curiously, watching as Qiu Tan extracted metals far exceeding the crate's capacity.  

He was genuinely intrigued. A cultivator's storage pouch had limited space, yet Qiu Tan, despite his modest means, possessed such a high-capacity storage item—something hard to believe.  

"This is for commercial use. The internal space is highly unstable and can only hold low-value items, with the constant risk of destruction. The formation materials and spiritual herbs were stored in my storage pouch," Qiu Tan explained with a smile.  

He retrieved the formation materials and herbs from his pouch, adding them to the pile of metals on the ground, completing the transaction.  

"I didn't expect you to be growing Rune Spirit Bamboo, Brother Li. Bamboo paper made from it enhances wood-attribute spells and is highly sought after in the market. The bamboo shoots are even more prized by gourmet cultivators... And the spices in your spirit fields—if you ever plan to sell them, be sure to consider me!" Qiu Tan's business instincts kicked in as he spotted the bamboo grove.  

"Of course, of course!" Li Shiming hurriedly ushered him out, fearing Qiu Tan might linger.  

Unbeknownst to Qiu Tan, he had just missed an opportunity—Li Shiming had initially planned to invite him into his cave abode.  

Having few acquaintances in the sect, Li Shiming still had some freshly brewed spirit tea leaves left. Unfortunately, Qiu Tan's relentless sales pitch had dissuaded him from offering hospitality.  

Thankfully, the spirit tea tree was in the machine room space, and the spirit spring water and fish were in the underground chamber. Otherwise, Li Shiming would have worried about Qiu Tan trying to buy those too.  

Under Li Shiming's enthusiastic farewell, Qiu Tan left Eagle Beak Island with his massive crate.  

The crate, being a spatial item, couldn't be stored in a pouch. The return journey was just as arduous as the trip there.  

Yet Qiu Tan was in high spirits, humming a cheerful tune.  

This investment seemed to be paying off handsomely. Li Shiming's future appeared even brighter than he'd imagined—after all, he knew Fairy Yin, and their relationship seemed far from ordinary.  

Qiu Tan's sharp eyes had caught the unmistakable scent of romance from afar.  

With Fairy Yin's backing, Li Shiming was bound to soar.  

This triumphant mood stayed with Qiu Tan all the way back to Everlight Island and into his shop.  

"Boss Qiu, what's got you so happy?" a Qi Refinement stage clerk asked with a grin.  

The shop employed three Qi Refinement cultivators: Qiu Tan at the fifth layer, and two clerks at the first and second layers.  

Such low-level cultivators were common in the sect's territory—those with abysmal spiritual roots after the Heavenly Sea Sect's screening.  

Most chose to join the sect as miscellaneous disciples, clinging to a sliver of hope. Others sought independent lives, working in shops or workshops that provided resources in exchange for labor.  

Without external support, reaching even the first layer of Qi Refinement was nearly impossible for them, unless they resorted to methods that damaged their foundations.  

In Qiu Tan's shop, the three shared a familial bond.  

"Remember that promising spiritual farmer I mentioned?" Qiu Tan raised an eyebrow with a smile.  

"How could we forget? The best-selling spirit rice in our shop lately was grown by that Li Shiming!" the clerk nodded.  

Recently, customers who had bought Li Shiming's spirit rice specifically requested it again. The quality was unusually high.  

"That's him. Guess who I saw on Eagle Beak Island when I delivered the goods?" Qiu Tan teased mysteriously.  

"Don't keep us in suspense, Boss Qiu! Spit it out!" the clerks feigned impatience.  

Unnoticed by them, a tall cultivator in brocade robes passed by the shop's entrance.  

"I saw Fairy Yin!" Qiu Tan whispered.  

"Which Fairy Yin?" one clerk asked blankly.  

"Which other Fairy Yin could it be in our Heavenly Sea Sect?" the other clerk answered for him.  

"Wait—I didn't even notice earlier, but Brother Li has advanced to the fourth layer of Qi Refinement!" Qiu Tan suddenly slapped his forehead in realization.  

His focus had been entirely on the juicy gossip about Fairy Yin and Li Shiming, overlooking Li Shiming's breakthrough.  

"In such a short time? Having a powerful backer really helps!" Qiu Tan was about to continue when he noticed a customer entering. He promptly ended the chat and put on his professional smile.  

Gossiping privately with his clerks was one thing, but business came first.  

Cultivators led monotonous lives, and such topics were mere diversions.  

Bai Li Jinyan had been captivated by Yin Shilan when he met her at the Sacred Ice Sect. He believed their similar backgrounds, ages, strength, and potential made them a perfect match.  

Yet Yin Shilan remained aloof, speaking to him only when necessary.  

Her indifference only deepened his obsession.  

Now, he had traveled thousands of miles to the Heavenly Sea Sect, hoping to win her heart.  

Visiting Everlight Island's market was merely to purchase local specialties for female acquaintances back in the Sacred Ice Sect.  

But to his shock, while browsing the market, he overheard talk about Yin Shilan.  

Though Qiu Tan hadn't elaborated on her relationship with the cultivator named Li Shiming on Eagle Bear Island, his tone reeked of envy—clearly implying something more than casual acquaintance.  

Suppressing his fury, Bai Li Jinyan reminded himself that this wasn't the Sacred Ice Sect but the Heavenly Sea Sect, an equally formidable power. Causing trouble here could spark a conflict between the two sects.  

Given his status, his actions could represent the Sacred Ice Sect.  

When he stepped into the shop hoping for more details, the conversation had already ended.  

Bai Li Jinyan composed himself. Since setting his sights on Yin Shilan, he had considered her his exclusive property.  

With Li Shiming's name and Eagle Beak Island's location, he had all he needed.  

As for the shopkeepers who dared gossip about Yin Shilan, he'd deal with them after settling Li Shiming.  

If done discreetly, the Heavenly Sea Sect wouldn't stir up trouble over a few lowly mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.  

"Give me 100 catties of spirit rice," Bai Li Jinyan pretended to shop, addressing Qiu Tan directly.  

"Right away! You're in luck—we just received a batch of premium spirit rice at only two spirit stones per catty!" Qiu Tan greeted him warmly.  

After discovering the exceptional quality of Li Shiming's rice, he had doubled the price. Surprisingly, this boosted sales rather than deterring customers.  

Those who pinched pennies wouldn't buy it anyway, while discerning buyers didn't mind the markup.  

"Fine," Bai Li Jinyan nodded.  

As Qiu Tan turned, Bai Li Jinyan flicked his finger, leaving a faint mark on Qiu Tan's robe.  

This tracking imprint would allow him to locate Qiu Tan within a thousand miles over the next ten days.  

Unaware of the danger his gossip had invited, Qiu Tan busied himself preparing the rice.  

Bai Li Jinyan marked the two clerks as well—none would escape his wrath.  

Soon, he left the market with his purchase.  

Boarding his flying boat, he consulted a jade slip containing a detailed map—far more comprehensive than the standard sect maps available to most.  

This one covered the entire continent, including classified sect intelligence.  

Inserting the slip into the boat's formation array, he projected a holographic terrain map centered on his location.  

A mental query pinpointed Eagle Beak Island, which lit up instantly.  

"Found you," Bai Li Jinyan muttered coldly, Yin Shilan's exquisite face flashing in his mind as murderous intent surged.  

He envisioned a hundred ways to torture Li Shiming to death. The outcome was never in doubt—unless Li Shiming hid within the Heavenly Sea Sect's nine peaks, escape was impossible. The gap between them was insurmountable.  

The flying boat cloaked itself and accelerated, vanishing into the sky in an instant.
