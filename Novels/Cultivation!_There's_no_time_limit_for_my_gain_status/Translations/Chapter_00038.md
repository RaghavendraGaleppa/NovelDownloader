# Chapter 38: The Parasitic Entity

"This... is this an Immortal Fate Stone?"

The Immortal Fate Stone—an object that had fundamentally altered their lives. Even after several months, the group still vividly remembered these rather unremarkable-looking crystals.

"Yes, this is indeed an Immortal Fate Stone."

This was the very stone Jiang Li had asked Yan Hong to purchase from the Ascension Pavilion. Thinking it might prove useful during their mission, he had tucked it into his robes before setting out.

"The Transmission Elder once said that those with spiritual root aptitude, even if they haven't embarked on the path of cultivation, would naturally absorb spiritual energy from heaven and earth at a slow pace, making them stronger and longer-lived than ordinary people."

"That's why I suspected this boy might possess spiritual roots."

Jiang Li offered this explanation for his conjecture, though in truth, the advantages spiritual root bearers had over common folk were minimal at best. His reasoning was rather tenuous.

The real reason Jiang Li harbored such suspicions and brought out the Immortal Fate Stone for verification was that his "Parasitic Seed Puppetry Technique" had been expelled!

Before the boy was injured by Zhengyuan, the "seed" planted within his body had already been forced out by some external force.

If resisting Jiang Li's technique could be attributed to exceptional willpower or innate talent, achieving this degree of resistance was utterly impossible for an ordinary person.

Jiang Li's true suspicion was that something existed within these children's bodies.

This entity resided within them, causing their comatose state while simultaneously preserving their lives when severely injured, expelling foreign intrusions, and potentially even bestowing spiritual roots upon its hosts!

"But him having spiritual roots doesn't prove anything. He might have simply missed the spiritual root test and was overlooked by the Ascension Pavilion."

"The outer sect mission requires us to either cure them and resolve the issue in Yinnan Kingdom or at least investigate the cause and report back."

"But what does a comatose child having spiritual roots have to do with our mission?"

The group remained perplexed about the significance of Jiang Li's claims.

"What if I told you that all two thousand children in the square outside possess spiritual roots?"

Facing their skepticism, Jiang Li dropped a bombshell.

"Two thousand people? All with spiritual roots? Impossible!"

Yu Banxia and the others reflexively rejected Jiang Li's speculation.

Spiritual root aptitude wasn't quite one in ten thousand, but it was generally about one in a thousand.

The entire Dazhong Mountain region encompassed hundreds of countries, yet each Ascension Assembly selected fewer than ten thousand prospective disciples.

---

Yinnan Kingdom was a small nation, and this was merely its capital. The number of children aged eight to fourteen couldn't be very large.

If Jiang Li's words were true, the proportion of children here with spiritual root aptitude might far exceed one in ten, making Yinnan Kingdom truly a divinely favored land.

If this proved accurate, the coma incidents would pale in significance.

"I can hardly believe it myself, but the world is vast and full of wonders. To verify, we should test more children—the truth will become clear."

Jiang Li could make such claims confidently because he had already conducted tests.

After Monk Zhengyuan departed, harboring suspicions, Jiang Li immediately used the Immortal Fate Stone to randomly test several dozen children. Without exception, all showed positive reactions.

Spiritual roots weren't like turnips—plentiful in all shapes and sizes. For such numbers to appear simultaneously, external interference was the only plausible explanation.

Retrieving the Immortal Fate Stone, Jiang Li led the group to another room similarly packed with comatose children.

After dismissing the palace maids and nannies feeding the children, Jiang Li handed the stone to Lu Qianqian to avoid impropriety, having her test them one by one.

Extinguishing the lamps, they watched as faint, misty glows repeatedly illuminated the darkened room.

One case could be coincidence, two might be fate's whim, three could be heaven's jest...

But what of four? Five, six, seven?

By the time all hundred-plus children in the room tested positive for spiritual roots, the group stood dumbfounded.

"This... this Immortal Fate Stone... couldn't be malfunctioning, could it?"

Upon reflection, this wasn't impossible.

They hastily tested several awake children, but the stone showed no reaction whatsoever.

Thus, disbelief gave way to reluctant acceptance.

"They... they really all have spiritual roots!"

"This mission has surpassed our capacity to handle. We must report to the sect immediately!"

Jiang Li and the more perceptive members wore expressions of grave seriousness.

"Then... does that mean our mission failed?"

Lu Qianqian, still fixated on curing the children, momentarily failed to grasp the gravity of the situation. She assumed seeking the sect's assistance before completing the mission equated to failure.

"Qianqian, the mission no longer matters."

Whether the children remained comatose, whether they could be cured, or whether they could uncover the truth—none of these were paramount anymore.

Two thousand prospective cultivators with spiritual roots—at Ascension Assembly prices...

---

Even the lowest-grade spiritual roots fetched two spirit stones per discovery.

While the Hidden Scripture Valley's outer sect hadn't issued recruitment missions, they never turned away cheap labor like outer sect disciples.

Such a massive influx of cultivation candidates meant that merely relaying this information would guarantee substantial rewards from the sect, however stingy they might be.

Even divided eight ways, their shares would rival Jiang Li's three-month earnings from drug trials.

Yu Banxia's explanation quickly enlightened the group, their expressions shifting to eager excitement.

A lottery ticket convertible to vast wealth now lay before them—their only task was cashing it in.

"Then what are we waiting for? Let's return to the sect immediately!"

One disciple exclaimed excitedly.

But Jiang Li and Yu Banxia remained solemn.

"It's not that simple."

Jiang Li shook his head.

"Remember what Monk Zhengyuan of the Mercy Temple said?"

"He advised against leaving the city and urged us to return to the sect promptly after completing our mission."

"We still don't know the full situation about the emerging demonic entities, but for some reason, numerous cultivators have been drawn here."

At this, the group's excitement waned.

In just one afternoon, five or six groups of cultivators had visited the palace, indicating significant numbers had gathered in Yinnan Kingdom's capital.

Jiang Li's group weren't antisocial, but they'd entered the palace precisely to avoid trouble.

After all, sect-affiliated cultivators were somewhat easier to deal with.

Those rogue cultivators, usually so meek and humble, could instantly transform into demonic cultivators given the slightest opportunity, demonstrating their prowess in murder and plunder.
