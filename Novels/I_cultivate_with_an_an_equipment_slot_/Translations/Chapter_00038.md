# Chapter 38: The Sect's Plans

After swallowing the pill, the foolish bird immediately began convulsing violently, white foam bubbling from its beak.

"Hmm? This is a Qi Gathering Pill!" Seeing the bird's reaction, Zhang Yan picked up the pill bottle to examine it closely. The label clearly identified it as such.

He poured out all the pills for closer inspection and quickly realized they were mixed—two types of pills that looked nearly identical. Only upon careful examination could the differences be discerned.

"A hidden trap?" In that moment, Zhang Yan understood the treacherous nature of the cultivation world. Fortunately, his vigilance had saved him—otherwise, he would have been the one poisoned.

Watching the bird on the verge of death, Zhang Yan calmly retrieved a bottle of antidote pills from his storage bag and fed one to the bird. These were given to him by Elder Bai, and while he had never needed them, the foolish bird had become their first beneficiary.

The antidote proved effective. Soon, the bird stopped moving, though it was unclear whether it had recovered or died. After a while, however, it suddenly flapped back to life.

"Elder Bai is reliable after all—this antidote works wonders!" Though the Qi Gathering Pill test had failed, confirming the antidote's potency was still a worthwhile discovery.

"Come here, let's try this one." Zhang Yan picked out another pill and turned to the bird, which trembled and backed away in fear.

"Stupid bird, I'm giving you an opportunity! Besides, we've already confirmed the antidote works!" Ignoring its reluctance, Zhang Yan shoved the pill into its beak.

This time, luck was on the bird's side—it was indeed a genuine Qi Gathering Pill. After ensuring the bird showed no adverse reactions, Zhang Yan finally consumed one himself and began meditating.

After cultivating for a couple of hours, the sound of flying swords echoed through the sky. Zhang Yan opened his eyes to see Qingheng Market disciples returning, escorting several individuals.

Not long after, he was summoned by an elder to learn the details. The Qingheng Market's enforcers had eliminated two Zhou family Foundation Establishment cultivators and dozens of Qi Refining cultivators, completely eradicating the Zhou clan.

"An entire family... wiped out." Zhang Yan couldn't help but marvel at the news. The Zhou family had Foundation Establishment experts—he had assumed the sect would only issue a light punishment, never expecting total annihilation.

For the first time, Zhang Yan felt a strong sense of belonging to the sect. Being part of such a powerful faction was indeed reassuring.

The Liu family, however, had fared better. Patriarch Liu Changfeng had perished, but one of their elders survived and was rescued by Qingheng Sect disciples.

"Many thanks, Fellow Daoist Zhang." The Liu elder, though weary, bowed in gratitude.

"It was only right. Had you not held them off, I wouldn't have escaped either. It's just a shame about Patriarch Liu..." Zhang Yan sighed. Liu Changfeng had treated him well, yet an accident had claimed his life.

"Changfeng... Alas." The elder shook his head. "Perhaps it was fate."

Zhang Yan offered what comfort he could before the elder departed with Liu Yiting, who was still dazed and nursing a sore neck.

Left to wait for his escort back to the sect, Zhang Yan passed the time practicing spells. Whether due to the Enlightenment Mat's enhancement or his own persistence, his Wood Manipulation Technique finally reached perfection.

"My first perfected spell!" Delighted, Zhang Yan took out a seed. Under the technique's influence, it sprouted, grew, and blossomed into a carnivorous Spirit Devouring Flower with razor-sharp teeth.

"Not bad." Though pleased, Zhang Yan noted its limitations—his limited spiritual energy meant the flower only had mid-Qi Refining strength and lasted barely fifteen minutes. Compared to Mu Sen's late-Qi Refining variant, it was a pale imitation. Still, for a third-level Qi Refining cultivator, this was an achievement.

Days later, a speeding spirit boat arrived to retrieve him.

"Senior Brother Mu?" Zhang Yan was surprised to see Mu Sen as his escort.

"I heard about the incident and volunteered since I travel quickly," Mu Sen explained with a smile.

"Quickly indeed..." Zhang Yan recalled Mu Sen's terrifyingly fast flying skills. The outwardly reserved senior brother was a speed demon.

"Let's return to the sect," Mu Sen said.

Nodding, Zhang Yan retrieved the foolish bird from his residence and tucked it into his sleeve before boarding the spirit boat—an artifact-grade vessel far superior to ordinary magical tools. The breakneck speed left even Zhang Yan, no stranger to fast travel, gripping his seat in terror.

His senior brother was excellent in every way... except for being too fast!

"Any plans after returning, Junior Brother?" Mu Sen asked mid-flight.

"Farming and cultivation," Zhang Yan answered without hesitation.

Mu Sen burst into laughter. "Not bad! But farming alone won't get you far. My advice? Strive to become an inner disciple—maybe even a true disciple. Otherwise, you might not even get to farm."

His expression turned serious. "The spiritual veins in Tianmu Mountain are dwindling, and resources are scarce. Without action, chaos will erupt. You'd best advance quickly."
