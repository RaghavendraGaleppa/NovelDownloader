Chapter 252: The Tomb’s Inheritance, the Pure Yang Recluse, As If Entering a Wonderland

The mountain range was majestic, possessing an extraordinary aura. Colorful cranes flew south, while white mist swirled thickly.

Green pines hung from the cliffs, and impure lotuses grew from the earth. Crimson clouds scattered to the east, and rainbow lights flowed. It was serene, unaware of winter or summer; it was distant, unconscious of the passage of years.

Amidst the perilous mountains, a wonderland was hidden.

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "Even if we cannot find the map to get out, it would not be a waste to have walked this path. To live here is better than resting in the woods."

They walked into the tomb's mountain range.

It was like stepping into a new world. The feeling of dampness and oppression vanished completely, replaced by a refreshing clarity as if they had been reborn. This place had been nurturing for thousands of years, giving birth to miraculous fruits.

A vine hung down, its end bearing a small, vermilion fruit. Li Xian casually plucked it and swallowed it. His blood energy rushed rapidly, and his hair turned much darker.

Li Xian leaped up and down, light and agile. He gathered all the Vermilion Fruits for storage. The tomb's mountain range stretched for miles, with side peaks and front peaks... overlapping in a magnificent and orderly scale.

Wen Caishang observed the mountains and surveyed the land, employing all the knowledge she had learned in her lifetime. She realized that the tomb's layout involved "Nanyang customs," "geomancy and construction," "timing and terrain," "Daoist scriptures," and many other miscellaneous studies. She became even more certain that the tomb's owner was the "Pure Yang Recluse, Lu Dongzhi." Even with her status, hearing the clues of this ancient recluse, she couldn't help but feel a sense of yearning.

She did not hesitate to impart her knowledge.

Her words leaked out knowledge, all of it rare and secret information.

Li Xian was of humble origin but exceptionally talented. He had always known that "martial paths are hard to find" and "talent and knowledge are hard to seek." As he listened to Wen Caishang's eloquent discourse, he saw that with knowledge and intellect alone, one could resolve many difficulties and cleverly avoid various calamities. He felt even more that "talent and knowledge" were precious. Whenever he had the chance, he would absorb everything, storing all the knowledge and secrets into his mind.

After surveying for half a day and taking in the entire mountain, Wen Caishang shook her head and said softly, "The tomb's master is far more skilled in geomancy than I."

Li Xian asked, "We cannot enter?"

"Not so," Wen Caishang said.

"The tomb's master had an immense vision. There are several lakes within the mountain range of the tomb, and the mountain's form has the charm of embracing the stars and holding the moon. It alludes to encompassing the universe, with a bosom as vast as the sea. With such a temperament, I suspect his tomb would not be completely sealed, fearing that later generations might enter. Instead, it would be left to chance and nature. The entrance is likely somewhere, but one must find it through their own exploration."

Cranes sang of spring, and light clouds brought warmth. Wen Caishang climbed the mountain with measured steps, her mind racing, beads of sweat on her forehead, yet her eyes were filled with excitement.

They climbed over one hundred and ninety zhang. The main entrance of the tomb faced a lake amidst a green sea of secluded forests. The lake was named "Eye-Pointing Lake," the key to the tomb's geomantic omen. Wen Caishang had long since deduced this, and thus had early on determined that the main entrance was here. But for a tomb, the main entrance is often the most difficult to pass.

She had come up the mountain specifically to observe the tomb owner's temperament. There are countless tombs in this world, and because the owner's life experiences, temperament, methods, and preferences were different, the degree of danger within the tomb naturally varied greatly.

Although Wen Caishang was increasingly certain that the tomb was Lu Dongzhi's, her knowledge of him came entirely from ancient texts. There were bound to be discrepancies.

Therefore, by looking at the tomb's main entrance, she could gauge the tomb's danger from the details.

She saw the gate set halfway up the mountain, overlooking the green sea. The gate was square, possessing a great air of embracing the world.

The view was broad, the wind high and the air refreshing. There was no trace of Yin energy. Wen Caishang secretly admired it, thinking that if she were to die, her tomb would be filled with mechanisms, ensuring that anyone who came would never return. The tomb gate would be dignified and magnificent, but凶险 would begin to hide itself miles away.

Wen Caishang murmured:

"A guest comes from the clouds, please take the crane's inner elixir."

A stone stele stood before the gate, inscribed with a few words. They were a chaotic "cursive script," displaying an unrestrained and wild spirit through the brush.

Wen Caishang said, "During the Nanyang period, calligraphy valued spirit over form. It differs vastly from the calligraphy of the Great Yu and Great Wu eras. The great calligraphers of the Great Wu era, like your younger brother's master, Fu Haoran, have always sneered at the Nanyang school of calligraphy."

"However, in my opinion, this flying and domineering calligraphy has its own charm. The times were chaotic then, and the recluse was naturally wild and unrestrained. Later generations would find it hard to have such a person again."

She spoke at length, gently stroking the stele. She couldn't help but ponder the stele's meaning. Her nature was far from open-minded, completely opposite to the tomb owner's, so she truly couldn't understand its intention.

Li Xian's knowledge was shallow, but he possessed a certain open-minded air. Although he didn't understand calligraphy, he stood before the stele and pondered it with grace.

At first glance, Li Xian found the characters ugly and chaotic. But upon closer inspection, he felt that the person who wrote them must be wild and unrestrained, laughing wildly while writing. He thus disregarded the character forms and appreciated the faint rhythm.

Wen Caishang said, "Though cursive script is scrawled, it has its own rules," using the opportunity to teach Li Xian about calligraphy and literature.

Li Xian's感悟 grew stronger, and in a daze, it felt as if he were communing spiritually with the tomb owner. He felt a surprising sense of affinity. He thought, "Am I daydreaming? How could a great tomb master like this commune with me?"

His head grew dizzy, and he gradually felt tired and sleepy. Li Xian looked out at the mountain range, let out a couple of loud cries, and his mind cleared, his condition becoming good.

The stone gate was old and solid, covered in moss. It was difficult to push open, so they had to look for another way.

Wen Caishang noticed a flaw in the geomancy. On the side peak of the tomb's mountain, there was a place that had been eroded by wind and rain over the years. The geology had shifted, creating a crack.

The crack led into the tomb. Although it was in a remote location, following the path could lead to the main burial chamber and other places. If there really was a map inside the tomb, this would be the breakthrough.

The crack in the mountain was very narrow, barely passable. Li Xian looked into the darkness, but his view was blocked by messy rocks, making it hard to see the bottom.

Li Xian thought, "What's the point of worrying so much? Let's give it a try!" He let go of his inhibitions, tied the Green Jade Silken Cord to a tree trunk, and pulled hard to confirm it was secure. Then, using the Seven Star Steps, he began to explore downwards.

Wen Caishang was very embarrassed and cursed under her breath. The method of tying the cord came from the "Silk Garment and Jade Skill." It was originally meant to be tied to oneself, but now it was tied to a tree trunk.

"You brat, you're making fun of me on purpose," Wen Caishang thought. Her gaze was moist, and her romantic feelings grew stronger. After spending so much time together, sharing life and death... so many feelings were积压 in her heart.

The first few zhang were dark and cramped. As they went deeper, a faint glow flickered from the rock walls, and the space became wider and more open.

A breeze blew up from below, rustling their clothes and hair. Li Xian used the light from the crevice in the wall to go deeper several zhang. The Green Jade Silken Cord was already half used up, and he found himself in a vast emptiness.

Li Xian thought, "I don't know how deep this crevice is, and the Green Jade Silken Cord has a limited length. It's not wise to keep going deeper blindly. I need to think of a way to explore the bottom first."

He saw the crevice was dotted with a glow, like starlight, and reached out to grab it. He scraped off some fine ore from the wall and immediately understood: "These ores are shaped like sand grains, but they emit a faint light. They must be Star-Spotted Stones. They were originally hidden deep in the mountain walls, but the wind and rain washed the crevice, revealing them. I'll make use of them!"

He used the "Mysterious Cloud Hand" to probe the clouds and take the mist... probing the wall to take the stones. After a few moves, he had gathered all the Star-Spotted Stones around him. Feeling it wasn't enough, he swung his body and frantically collected more "Star-Spotted Stones."

Having collected enough, Li Xian opened his palm, and the center of his hand was brilliantly lit with starlight.

He secretly used the "Green Silk Palm," and a mist of water burst from his palm. He rubbed and squeezed hard, gathering them into a ball. The Star-Spotted Stones glowed with a blue light, illuminating a zhang around him.

He then threw the Star-Spotted Stones down.

After a few breaths, a "thud" was heard as they hit the ground and shattered. Starlight sand scattered everywhere, revealing the bottom of the crevice. A rough estimate showed it was only about ten zhang deep.

There were some weeds and venomous snakes. Li Xian thought, "I don't know how potent the venom of these snakes is. If I get bitten, it would be terrible." He hooked his toes against the crevice in the rock wall. He took his bow and shot repeatedly, clearing away all the dangers.

Li Xian used his lightness skill to descend. He explored the surroundings again, finding no other dangers, and confirmed it was a path into the tomb. He climbed back up the crevice to bring Wen Caishang down.

Wen Caishang knew what Li Xian had done and praised him joyfully, "You are very cautious, that's good." She then thought that much of what Li Xian did was for her, and she fell even deeper into infatuation.

They lit a torch. The path ahead was narrow.

The two walked one after the other and arrived at an empty room. Candles were lit in the room, and they had apparently been burning for thousands of years without extinguishing.

Li Xian bowed sincerely and said, "It is truly inappropriate to disturb the senior's peace. We have come to borrow some things, and I hope you will grant your permission."

Wen Caishang nodded slightly and followed with a "Nanyang embrace salute." She observed the four walls. The east wall depicted a dragon, the north wall a tiger... any one of these paintings would be priceless. But being in a dangerous place, to harbor greed would surely invite disaster.

Therefore, they only admired and did not touch. Wen Caishang said, "These four murals also foreshadow the tomb's layout," and detailed what she knew and observed.

The tomb's mechanisms were linked in series, and maze-like paths were endless.

Wen Caishang cleverly avoided the mechanisms and the maze paths, following the tomb's corridors deeper. They saw many Nanyang jade artifacts, stone carvings, murals... miscellaneous items, too many to count.

Entering the tomb was like returning home. They were elegant and composed, yet took nothing. Although Li Xian was naturally fond of wealth, he was not attached to it. He didn't even look at the treasures.

However, the tomb's layout was precise, and some mechanisms were hard to avoid. After walking for an unknown length of time, they saw a narrow path.

Wen Caishang stopped and said gravely, "This is not good." Li Xian asked, "Why? Is there a mechanism in this path?"

Wen Caishang said, "There is no mechanism, but the mystery is deep. It contains the Eight Trigrams and the Five Elements. This path is called the 'Twisting Intestine Path.' The path is narrow, but the passage is complex. Sometimes a step forward or a step backward is enough to separate the two of you by a great distance."

Li Xian said, "Then we must hold on tight." He took the opportunity to embrace her, his hands wandering. Wen Caishang's body went soft, both helpless and coyly annoyed. She said softly, "You're taking advantage again."

Wen Caishang shook her head and said, "This Twisting Intestine Path has a complex mechanism. It doesn't harm people, it only separates them. If you hold me, we won't be able to get out. If I don't hold you, we will definitely be separated."

Li Xian said, "Find another way?" Wen Caishang said, "This tomb master is a man of great vision, with a temperament as deep as an abyss. Although there are mechanisms in the tomb, they only guard against petty thieves. If we take another route, we might still encounter the Twisting Intestine Path."

"In that case... I will tell you everything I know about the tomb. You can enter the Twisting Intestine Path and search for the mountain range map. I will wait here. That is the safest way."

Wen Caishang knew her luck was bad. Although her knowledge was profound, she had no internal Qi. If an意外 occurred, she would have a hard time应对. For the past few months, she had relied on Li Xian's care and had long become dependent. The thought of parting in the tomb instantly left her with no confidence.

Through the tomb, she had窥知 that the tomb owner was open-minded and had a temperament as vast as the sea. Although the tomb was strange, it was not vicious or cruel... if one掌握 the right countermeasures, self-preservation should be fine.

So she came up with this compromise. Li Xian said, "Alright! For the sake of the Madam, I will take the risk!" He was open-minded and not拘泥, but his flirtatious nature was truly hard to change.

Wen Caishang knew Li Xian was exaggerating on purpose, but she couldn't help but be stirred. She said, "You must not get hurt, you must not die. If... if you really..." Her eyes actually turned slightly red.

They embraced for a long time, and then for the next few days.

Wen Caishang taught Li Xian the miscellaneous knowledge of the tomb, the strange stories of Nanyang, geomancy... and so much knowledge. Wen Caishang's words were concise, and Li Xian was clever and quick-witted. He quickly mastered the knowledge of the tomb, the relevant information about Nanyang, the anecdotes of Lu Dongzhi's life... and so on.

After being fully prepared, Li Xian, wearing his bow and sword and fully equipped, stepped into the Twisting Intestine Path. After a few steps, the path ahead was complex and confusing, twisting and turning, bewildering the mind.

Li Xian thought, "The 'Coiled Intestine Small Step' of the Flower Cage Gate also has this ability. I wonder if the principles are the same?"

In fact, they were indeed similar. The Coiled Intestine Small Step and the Twisting Intestine Path... the principles are close, both involving the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams. But the Coiled Intestine Small Step is narrow and insidious, while the Twisting Intestine Path is vast and complex, several times more powerful.

Li Xian walked for about half a day. He had completely lost track of where he was.
