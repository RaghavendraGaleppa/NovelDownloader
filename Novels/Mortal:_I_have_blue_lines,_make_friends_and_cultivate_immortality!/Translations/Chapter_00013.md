# Chapter 13: Great Development Technique, Gold Devouring Beetles!

[Ding! Congratulations, host, for obtaining the divine sense secret technique—Great Development Technique (Complete Version).]

[Treasure Description: The Great Development Technique, passed down by Great Development Divine Monarch from the Far West, can greatly enhance divine sense power. The first four layers were obtained by Han Li from Uncle Lin of Yellow Maple Valley. The complete version was acquired when he sought out Great Development Divine Monarch in the Far West.]

"Mm-hmm—not bad!" Lin Yun nodded in satisfaction.

Still unwilling to give up, he turned to Han Li again. "Brother Han, are you really sure you don't want any of these magic tools?"

With a flip of his palm, a small earthen-yellow shield appeared in Lin Yun's hand.

"This is the top-tier defensive magic tool, Earth Essence Shield. It can protect your life in dangerous situations. What happened today really scared me. If anything had happened to you, I, as your elder brother, would have blamed myself endlessly."

"Brother Han, I feel like we've been friends for years—"

Han Li glanced at the Earth Essence Shield in Lin Yun's hand. He actually wanted it very much, but this time, no matter how much Lin Yun insisted, he refused to accept it.

Seeing that he couldn't force it on him, Lin Yun had no choice but to relent, planning to find another opportunity later.

He had to take advantage of this period when the future "Old Demon" Han Li had nothing to give him some items. Once Han Li entered Yellow Maple Valley, he would become self-sufficient and would be even less likely to accept gifts from Lin Yun.

Now was the time when the returns would be greatest.

A storage pouch in exchange for a pocket dimension treasure—the profit from this was simply immeasurable!

As it grew late, Lin Yun and Han Li each returned to their rooms to rest.

Later that night, Hu Pinggu, Xiong Dali, Hei Mu, Ku Sang, and the others returned.

Everyone tacitly avoided mentioning how they had stood by indifferently during the day's events, maintaining an appearance of harmony.

Clearly, within this small group, another faction had emerged apart from Lin Yun and Han Li.

Neither Lin Yun nor Han Li paid this any mind.

Han Li, currently in his room, was overwhelmed with joy. He had previously heard that Foundation Establishment Pills were monopolized by the Seven Sects. With his current cultivation level, he would likely have to wait for the next Ascension Tournament—a delay of a full ten years!

"Brother Lin has truly given me an incredible gift!" Han Li held the "Green Stream Notes" in his left hand and the Ascension Token obtained from Golden Light Master in his right, his face alight with excitement.

He also now understood what the golden sword talisman in his possession truly was—a treasure known as a "Talisman Treasure"!

"Ah, once I enter Yellow Maple Valley, it'll probably be very difficult to see Brother Lin again. Before we part, I should give him all the remaining pills and spirit herbs I have. After all, once I'm in Yellow Maple Valley, I can use the small green vial to cultivate more."

Meanwhile, in Lin Yun's room, his face was also filled with irrepressible delight!

Today's gains had been enormous!

First and foremost was the pocket dimension treasure—Mountain-Sea Pearl!

With a thought, Lin Yun flipped his palm, and the pale blue crystalline pearl appeared in his hand.

In terms of power, this pocket dimension treasure couldn't compare to Heaven-defying Treasures, let alone the Profound Sky Gourd he had previously obtained.

But spatial treasures like this were exceedingly rare.

Han Li had only obtained one after reaching the Great Ascension Stage, acquiring it from the Void Fish Clan in the Little Asura World.

Yet here Lin Yun was, with one at the Qi Refining Stage!

"Can't use it for now—better store it safely," Lin Yun murmured to himself.

To prevent loss or theft of his storage pouch, Lin Yun kept his most valuable items directly in the system space. Only talismans, magic tools, and other frequently used items were stored in his pouch.

After putting away the Mountain-Sea Pearl, two streams of white mist sprayed from his storage pouch, and two jade slips appeared in his hands.

"The Great Development Technique! And the Vajra Arts!"

"Both are excellent. Once I settle into Yellow Maple Valley, I can start cultivating them." Lin Yun nodded and stored the items away.

While the Great Development Technique only required time to cultivate, the Vajra Arts demanded vast resources. Han Li had only completed the Vajra Arts in the Spirit Realm—body refinement was an extremely resource-intensive endeavor.

The sheer volume of resources required was impossible for Lin Yun to gather alone.

He would need to find a solution, but fortunately, this wasn't urgent and could be addressed gradually.

After storing the Great Development Technique, a blood-red talisman appeared in Lin Yun's palm. If not for the sealing talisman suppressing it, the writhing dragon soul on its surface alone would have been enough to annihilate him body and soul.

The basic requirement for using the Spirit Subduing Talisman was the Core Formation Stage, and to unleash its full power, one needed to be at the False Nascent Soul or even Nascent Soul Stage.

"Can't use this yet—store it!"

Lin Yun returned the Spirit Subduing Talisman to the system backpack.

Next, he took out everything else in one go:

The Beast Taming and Insect Control Techniques from the Beast Spirit Sect, the Ruler of Balance Talisman Treasure, Heaven Thunder Seed, Foundation Establishment Pill, Flower Basket Ancient Treasure, and the Imitation Eight Gates Golden Light Mirror.

There wasn't much to say about the Flower Basket Ancient Treasure and the Imitation Eight Gates Golden Light Mirror—Lin Yun hadn't reached the Core Formation Stage yet and couldn't use them, so he returned them to the system backpack.

The Ruler of Balance Talisman Treasure and Heaven Thunder Seed, however, went into his storage pouch—these were items he could use immediately.

As for the Foundation Establishment Pill, Lin Yun also temporarily stored it in the system backpack.

Even though he had the pill, he still needed to join Yellow Maple Valley—and he still had to visit the Bloody Battlefield.

He was joining Yellow Maple Valley to expand his network, not to cultivate. Even with the Foundation Establishment Pill, he had to go.

As for the Bloody Battlefield—how else would he befriend Nangong Wan?

One of Lin Yun's greatest joys in life was making friends!

Sincerity for sincerity!

The Beast Taming and Insect Control Techniques from the Beast Spirit Sect reminded him of something else he had to consider—the Gold Devouring Beetles from the Chaotic Star Sea.

Thinking of the Gold Devouring Beetles, Lin Yun frowned.

They were indeed incredibly powerful, but the resources they consumed were astronomical. Although he had his own cheat, what he obtained from others were usually ready-made items like pills, magic tools, or treasures—unlike Han Li's "Old Demon," he couldn't infinitely regenerate resources for a single item.

"This is a bit troublesome. Raising them would consume immeasurable resources, but not raising them means missing out on a powerful asset." Lin Yun found himself in a dilemma.

After some thought, he still couldn't come up with a viable solution.

"Forget it, I'll deal with this later."

"Even if I don't raise them myself, gifting them to Han Li later would surely yield a handsome return."

Lin Yun decided not to dwell on the matter for now. After all, his journey to the Chaotic Star Sea was still far off—better to focus on the present.

After organizing his recent acquisitions, Lin Yun didn't rest. Instead, he took out some Yellow Dragon Pills and Golden Marrow Pills obtained from Han Li, swallowed a few, and began meditating.

He had been stuck at the tenth level of Qi Refining for some time. With the help of Han Li's potent pills, he believed he could break through to the eleventh level tonight.

"Mmm—"

The next morning, Lin Yun opened his eyes after a night of cultivation.

After a night of arduous practice, his cultivation had reached the eleventh level of Qi Refining.

"Phew—"

Exhaling a long breath, Lin Yun stepped out of his room. "Let's see what that old demon is up to—and maybe find another chance to squeeze something good out of him."
