# Chapter 52: Auction's Dark Underbelly

At this moment, Wei Qian was still unaware that his new neighbor had already taken a dislike to him.

His mind was currently preoccupied with the demonic beast egg he had seen not long ago.

Gongyang Yan was right; the demonic beast egg had undergone some unforeseen change, and its remaining life force was incredibly faint, on the verge of completely dissipating at any moment.

Saving this egg would not only be difficult, but even if successful, the cost would be astronomically high.

For example, Wei Qian knew of a heavenly spiritual item called ‘Myriad-Year Stone Marrow Nectar’, which contained a vibrant life force. A single drop would be enough to save this demonic beast egg.

However, the true value of this item was enough to purchase a fully grown Black-Crowned Golden Eagle, with a considerable surplus. Using it to heal a demonic beast egg would definitely be a case of overkill.

Therefore, although the item had a resounding name, it was likely that very few cultivators would actually be willing to bid on it. It might even go unsold.

"However, while others may not have a suitable method to save this demonic beast egg, that doesn't mean I don't," Wei Qian thought to himself.

As long as he could prevent this trace of life force from completely vanishing, Wei Qian could attempt to use the power of the [Wish-Granting Dragon Pearl] to revive this demonic beast egg!

A Black-Crowned Golden Eagle is a second-rank demonic beast once it matures!

Just as Wei Qian was plotting how to get his hands on the demonic beast egg, in the adjacent compound, the mysterious black-robed man also took an interest in it.

He sat at a desk, holding an exquisite catalog, flipped open to one of its pages.

"A Black-Crowned Golden Eagle egg? There's such a good item?" he looked up and asked another person standing before the desk.

If Wei Qian were here, he would recognize that the person standing there was an old acquaintance: Bai Fugui’s cousin, Bai Fujie!

"It's just a dead egg. There's virtually no hope of reviving it."

"Otherwise, they would have already taken it to big places like Black Dragon Immortal City or Pill Cauldron Immortal City to auction," Bai Fujie said dismissively.

"Hmph, a dead egg is useless, you say? You still know too little," the black-robed cultivator scoffed.

"If someone who has contracted a bird-type spirit beast consumes this dead egg, there's a certain chance it could strengthen their own bloodline."

Bai Fujie unconsciously tilted his head, a fleeting, mocking smile appearing on his face.

"Young Master Tang truly lives up to his reputation as a big shot from Black Dragon Immortal City, gracing our humble abode with his presence!" he slipped in a seemingly innocuous jab.

Upon hearing this, the Tang-named cultivator's face immediately darkened, though it was hidden by his black robe.

"Heh heh, with the vastness of the Zhao Kingdom's cultivation world, I, Tang Tong, can go anywhere I please."

"If your Bai family has no intention of cooperating, then parting ways now is also an option," the black-robed cultivator threatened.

However, Bai Fujie was not at all swayed by this.

He was dealing with a tiger for its hide!

Before deciding to cooperate with this 'man-eating tiger,' he had thoroughly investigated the situation.

Currently, several 'hunters' were eyeing this 'man-eating tiger' with predatory intent.

They needed to use entities like the Bai family to conceal themselves and preserve their strength, so they wouldn't easily turn hostile.

However, this Young Master Tang Tong indeed had a formidable background.

His biological father was the Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator who had appeared in Black Dragon Immortal City some time ago!

Of course, while a powerful Foundation Establishment cultivator was fearsome, in the cultivation world of the Zhao Kingdom, even just within Yun Province, it wasn't enough to be truly dominant.

What truly worried Bai Fujie was that this newly emerging group of demonic cultivators was suspected of having support from external forces!

Their mastermind was very likely True Immortal Wuchang from Soul-Shaking Mountain!

Thinking of this, Bai Fujie's tone unconsciously softened.

"The cooperation was set by your esteemed father."

"If you wish to terminate the cooperation, then send a message to your father."

Bai Fujie also knew that while Tang Tong was arrogant, he wouldn't go so far as to bother his father with such a trivial matter.

A bloodthirsty demonic cultivator was feared not just by outsiders, but by their own family as well.

"Before that, the cooperation must continue."

"Hmph!" Tang Tong snorted disdainfully, but ultimately said nothing, continuing to examine the catalog.

A moment later, he handed the catalog back to Bai Fujie.

"I've made my selections."

The catalog listed various auction items and their owners, some of which had been circled by Tang Tong.

Bai Fujie took the catalog and carefully reviewed it.

He saw a familiar name inside—Wei Qian.

"Why did you circle his name?" Bai Fujie frowned, "My Bai family is currently making use of this person."

Tang Tong replied, "Isn't the purpose of our current operation to gather enough spirit stones to buy Foundation Establishment Pills?"

"He's an alchemist; how could his storage bag not have spirit stones?"

This reason only accounted for twenty-five percent. The remaining seventy-five percent stemmed from Wei Qian's previous disregard for him, which had deeply offended Young Master Tang.

Bai Fujie thought for a while, then decisively rejected it.

"No, choose someone else."

The young master Tang immediately protested, but his protest was also rebuffed by Bai Fujie.

Even a powerful dragon cannot overwhelm a local snake. In the end, Tang Tong could only grudgingly erase Wei Qian's circled name.

"Don't always think about killing the goose that lays the golden eggs," Bai Fujie admonished.

"The establishment of this auction house is also a good thing for you all. It will become a stable source of income in the future."

After confirming that the list contained no names of family or sect cultivators, Bai Fujie prepared to leave.

Before leaving, he left one final remark: "Take off that black robe! You're practically begging for people to know you're trouble."

At this time, Wei Qian was unaware that he had inadvertently dodged a crisis.

If he had known, he would certainly lament that auctions in the cultivation world truly could not be attended lightly.

Who would have thought that this newly organized auction, before it even officially began, was already being targeted by marauding cultivators?

Moreover, this group of rogue cultivators actually had connections with the auction's organizers.

The cultivators gathered on this lake island were also unaware that, in the shadows, a ravenous beast had already opened its bloody maw, awaiting the feast to begin so it could gorge itself.

Time quietly slipped away.

In the blink of an eye, the official day of the auction arrived.

On this day, the main hall doors of the auction house opened, immediately attracting streaks of light that flew forth.

Wei Qian, Gongyang Yan, Tie Xiangguang, and Fairy Ziluó entered the auction house one step ahead of the other cultivators.

Fairy Ziluó was the auction's host, while Wei Qian and the other two were responsible for maintaining order during the auction.

In addition to them, three other cultivators from the Bai family were also assigned to this task.

Fatty Bai's grand initiative naturally received support from his small Qi Condensation family of origin.

At this moment, the stout Fatty Bai was pressing his palms together, praying to the Immortals and True Ones of all Heavens.

"May Heaven bless us, may True Immortals bless us, may this auction be successfully held!"

Amidst his prayers, accompanied by a long and deep toll of a bell, the auction officially began.
