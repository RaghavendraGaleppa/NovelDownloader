# Chapter 268: Under the Marriage Tree (1/2)

Although the Suspended Temple appeared grand and ancient, it wasn't actually very large from the outside.

Each clan of demons followed a different guest-guiding monk into the thousand-year-old temple. They immediately felt the resonance of Zen chanting. Although the temple was vast, there were no pilgrims, making it even more peaceful.

In fact, the Suspended Temple remained hidden from the world throughout the year. Only when the Heavenly Jade from the Outside descended once every sixty years would the temple gates open; otherwise, they remained closed year-round.

The guiding monk for the Water Clan wore patched robes and was quite young. He walked ahead silently the entire way, never saying a word.

"Living in the same temple with so many different clans... won't there be conflicts?" Li Mo couldn't help but ask curiously.

"I think... probably... yes?" Mu Rongxiao looked toward the distance.

"Hm?"

"Brother Li, just look for yourself."

He followed the direction Mu Rongxiao pointed.

Just in front of the temple's main hall, a group of Bird Clan demons and a group of Water Clan demons were confronting each other. Both sides were fierce and arrogant, backed by large numbers.

"Our peerless Sky Floodragon has strength that can lift mountains and dominate the world. That mere Green Luan Goddess—once she falls into his hands, heh heh!"

"Vulgar and ignorant. When has the Bird Clan ever relied on brute force to win? Our Goddess moves like a startled shadow, graceful as a swan. Even a drop of ink wouldn't touch a single hair of hers. Do you even know what a hair is? Do you have any?"

"You're attacking with your demonic form? You're attacking with your demonic form, huh?"

"Go ahead, try it! If you hit me, I'll just lie right down."

"Ptui!"

The two sides argued fiercely. However, the Bird Clan's main attacker was a parrot demon, capable of spewing eight insults per second with formidable firepower. What was even more terrifying was that he was provoking them while being ready to lie down at any moment. Who could win an argument against that?

The Water Clan couldn't stand it anymore and temporarily switched in a Water Arrow Frog demon to spit back in retaliation.

The scene descended into utter chaos.

"......"

Little Li Sky Floodragon covered his face and quickly pulled Mu Rongxiao along to catch up with the group, afraid of being seen by those two factions.

Entering a side hall, they found a hidden world inside—a water marsh nestled against the mountains and beside the water.

For a moment, it was hard to tell whether they were still inside the Suspended Temple or if they had passed through the side hall's portal, traveling thousands of miles in an instant to another corner of the nine heavens and ten earths.

Li Mo had never seen such a technique even in the Hengyun Sword City, which showed just how profound the Suspended Temple's foundations were.

Hmm...

No wonder the demons of the Southern Frontier dared not make a move once they entered the temple.

When they arrived at the waterside chamber, Wu Qing, Mu Rongfeng, and a familiar-looking old monk were already inside. The guiding monk from earlier walked up and bowed to the old monk in a disciple's salute.

"Son, you're here."

"Quickly, pay your respects to Master Hengyuan."

Mu Rongxiao was stunned.

Li Mo glanced at him and said, "Master, I hope you have been well since we last met."

"Amitabha."

The kind-faced old monk Hengyuan smiled and returned the greeting.

After exchanging greetings, Li Mo remained silent. He had just used his Eye of Fate to see Hengyuan's recent experiences.

[Having traveled and investigated for a long time, he wishes to overcome all obstacles and take Mu Rongxiao as his disciple.]

As expected, Wu Qing spoke up, hoping her son would stay at the Suspended Temple for the time being.

"But I'm already a disciple of the Qingyuan Sect." Mu Rongxiao scratched his bald head and looked at Li Mo.

"If the elder agrees, it is permissible to join another sect."

"Hmm..."

Mu Rongxiao showed signs of struggle.

Li Mo thought for a moment and said, "After all, the Suspended Temple is in the Southern Frontier. You can also see your parents often."

The Suspended Temple was a prestigious, world-renowned Zen sect. To be honest, based on his temperament, Mu Rongxiao was more suited to Buddhist martial arts. Moreover, his half-demon body also needed the harmony of Buddhist teachings.

Although he might not be able to invest in Brother Mu Rong anymore in the future, he still hoped his friend could have a better future.

Mu Rongxiao hesitated for a while. After all, he had never thought about joining a Buddhist sect. But after careful consideration, and upon learning that the Suspended Temple allowed disciples to return to secular life, he agreed.

"Let's go."

Wu Qing seemed to let out a sigh of relief.

The couple took Mu Rongxiao and followed Hengyuan to the Suspended Temple's main hall.

Coincidentally, Li Mo also wanted to use his Eye of Fate to record some things before competing for the Heavenly Jade from the Outside.

Thus, everyone walked out of the side hall's hidden world where the Water Clan resided.

Monks would occasionally bow to Hengyuan, and demons would look on with reverence.

As he walked, Li Mo took out a small notebook to record his observations.

---

**[Name: Biao Lie]**
**[Age: 47]**
**[Physique: A trace of Qiongqi bloodline.]**
**[Realm: Late Stage of Seven Ranks (Late Stage of Divine Observation).]**
**[Fate: Blue]**
**[Evaluation: Qiongqi Clan, bloodline still thin.]**
**[Recent Experience: When entering the Suspended Temple's Ten Thousand Demon Tower, he could not withstand the test of his ancestors' true spirits.]**

...

**[Name: Yu Miao]**
...

**[Name: Qiu Ju]**
...

Along the way, they encountered many demons, some with formidable innate bloodlines.

Li Mo wrote as he walked, marking those worth investing in.

"I've only mastered one of the Seventy-Two Transformations so far. If I could get a drop of essence blood from these clans, wouldn't I be able to add many more transformations?"

If he could turn into a Green Luan, he could go to the Bird Clan's hidden world right now.

He truly regretted not having more transformations when he needed them...

He was envious.

As they walked, Wu Qing suddenly stopped.

"Husband, we've arrived here again."

"Decades have passed in a flash."

The couple looked emotional.

Li Mo looked ahead and saw a lush, ancient tree with dense leaves like a canopy. Many colorful pouches were tied to its extending branches, swaying in the wind. Many demons were trying to hang their own pouches on it.

"The Marriage Tree is still the same."

Wu Qing had once prayed under the Marriage Tree before meeting Mu Rongfeng not long after.

"Little Mo, why don't you give it a try? It's very effective."

Mu Rongfeng turned around and took out a pouch. "When my wife and I came to return a vow, the pouch she hung back then fell down. You can have it."

Li Mo took the pouch and shook his head. "I'm not very superstitious about these things."

...

Midnight.

There were no demons around.

A figure slipped out of the Water Clan's side hall under the cover of night and arrived at the Marriage Tree. Finding the place empty and not as bustling as during the day, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.

With a light leap, he jumped onto the tree.

Another pouch was added to the tree.

Among the many pouches, it wasn't very noticeable.

After finishing this, the Sky Floodragon patted his hands with satisfaction and was about to turn and leave.

*Plop—*

A light sound.

The pouch he had just hung fell down.

"Hm? Did I not tie it tight enough?"

Li Mo muttered to himself and climbed back up the tree.

Half an hour later.

Little Li stared blankly at the pouch that had fallen from the Marriage Tree for the third time, scratching the back of his head in confusion.

Even a double knot didn't work?

This was simply bizarre!

Was it that he wasn't worthy?

Or had the Marriage Tree malfunctioned?

Logically, pouches only fall when one comes to return a vow!

"Let's try one more time..."

Li Mo refused to accept this. This time, he planned to climb the Marriage Tree with his hands and feet, following the method he had inquired about.

He had barely climbed halfway up when a familiar, clear, and cool voice came from behind:

"You... what are you doing?"
