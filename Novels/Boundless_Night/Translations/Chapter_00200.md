# Chapter 200: Unexpected

"Please... Fairy Tang, what is she doing?"

Some were puzzled, like Tang Jun, who was still in a daze. Having personally witnessed a young man rise and defeat a Young Ancestor across realms, he hadn't yet recovered.

"No way?" Qian Chuan suddenly "understood."

In recent days, no one understood that youth better than him. He immediately guessed that this was a challenge to Tang Jin.

Indeed, Tang Jin, clad in black, graceful and tall, upon hearing this, her fair and delicate face almost darkened.

"Inviting Fairy Tang... to do what?" Cheng Rui asked in a low voice.

"Don't say anything!" Xin Youdao quickly stopped her.

In fact, even Zhao Minghui wasn't aware of what was happening. She was initially smiling until she saw Tang Jin's dark face, then she realized something.

The two elders, Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan, clicked their tongues. This youth was truly "brave"! Then they both watched the show with smiles.

The purple-eyed raven had a strange look; in fact, it was secretly smirking.

Ling Yu swayed, wiping the blood from his mouth, and immediately stepped forward, saying, "This was a duel between us; it's already over. My senior sister is not participating."

He was indeed worried, because this youth from Black White Mountain seemed truly unsolvable in the same realm.

"Just a simple spar," Qin Ming said.

Ling Yu sighed. In this duel, he hadn't even seen the height of "Ancestral Master Mountain," which was a great regret. His mood was quite complex.

Thinking back to when he was knocked out by a palm earlier, he was still indignant, thinking it was a sneak attack. Now, upon careful thought, if the opponent wasn't absolutely brilliant, how could he have suddenly approached him? Everything had been foreshadowed.

"This battle has concluded," Ling Yu said.

He knew that his senior sister was proud. Otherwise, she wouldn't have ascended to the Pure Land, Immortal Land, and Yang Land to challenge others alone back then.

If the youth from Black White Mountain insisted on challenging her, he felt his senior sister would definitely step forward.

Qin Ming didn't speak, just smiled at the aloof woman.

Tang Jin glared back, naturally understanding his meaning. This was truly "a thief's heart that refuses to die."

For a moment, the scene suddenly became quiet.

"It's just a spar, Sister Tang, how about I fight you instead?" Xiao Wu spoke, breaking the silence.

"These youths nowadays, each one braver than the last," Elder Yu Gensheng sighed. He knew very well who Tang Jin was; she was extremely formidable.

"Hmm?" Soon, he noticed Xiao Wu's anomaly. He looked unremarkable, yet dared to challenge Tang Jin? This wasn't right. Another good seedling.

Tang Jin glared fiercely at Xiao Wu, then walked towards Qin Ming, saying, "Are you sure you want to challenge me?"

"Certain!" Qin Ming replied with an extremely firm tone.

Tang Jin was slender and quite tall among women, only slightly shorter than Qin Ming. She walked gracefully, swaying elegantly.

"Don't you dare regret it!" She came closer, her dark hair flowing, her fair and delicate face like it was covered in ice and snow, making her appear even colder and more alluring.

Everyone became energized. The legendary Fairy Tang was also going to enter the arena. This was an extremely rare sight!

Although she wasn't old, her reputation was extremely widespread. She had long been able to contend with senior figures.

"Come on!" Qin Ming was impatient, divine light flowing in his eyes.

"Caw caw!" The purple-eyed raven couldn't help but laugh twice when it saw Tang Jin step down.

Instantly, Tang Jin turned her head and glared at it, feeling that this fellow had truly betrayed her, biting the hand that fed it. Was it really hoping to see her defeated?

In the arena, colorful mists flowed, clouds steamed and mists billowed. Qin Ming stood within a five-colored light wheel, like an exiled immortal, pure and transcendent. He raised his five-colored saber.

"Please!" he said, ready to go all out, to perform a "crushing victory." In the realm of the First Stage, he had absolute confidence.

"Heh..." Tang Jin smiled, like ice thawing. A person usually so aloof suddenly blossomed into a smile, which was surprisingly radiant.

However, Qin Ming felt that something was amiss!

Sure enough, there was no "aftermath" to this.

He maintained his posture, unable to move.

Tang Jin went all out from the start, using her inscrutable cultivation to "control the field."

Qin Ming's fluttering robes were frozen in place, the five-colored light wheel and the colorful mists around him were also still. This area seemed "frozen."

He couldn't even manage a bitter smile, still maintaining a confident expression, holding the five-colored saber in one hand, facing the black-clad woman who was walking lightly towards him.

Xiao Wu called out, "Miss Tang, that's not fair! My brother clearly wanted to spar with you in the First Realm!"

"Did he mention sparring in the same realm?" Tang Jin asked indifferently.

Wu Yaozu said, "He said it last time, so there's no need to emphasize it today."

"Last time? I forgot. And everyone heard it just now," Tang Jin smoothed her hair, then gracefully approached Qin Ming, revealing a faint smile.

Neither Xiao Wu nor Qin Ming had expected such an aloof, self-important person to have such a side.

Everyone was speechless. The famous Fairy Tang, facing a youth in the First Realm, actually used such a tactic, almost like cheating.

Tang Jin circled Qin Ming, then extended her fair slender hand and flicked the five-colored saber, producing a crisp saber hum.

"Alright, that's enough for today," Elder Zhao Ziyuan said.

Yu Gensheng's sleeve gently brushed, and Qin Ming found he could move. He immediately retreated a few steps. That was truly almost letting joy turn into sorrow.

"A true opponent, who would fight you at the same level?" Tang Jin said indifferently.

What could Qin Ming do? The promised spar was off, simply because her cultivation was higher, allowing her to say whatever she wanted.

"Don't be unconvinced. Even if we fought at the same level, you couldn't do anything to me," Tang Jin said calmly.

"I don't believe it," Qin Ming shook his head.

"I'll give you a chance!" Tang Jin retreated, creating enough distance, her body glowing, her black robes fluttering. She was actually going to have a second duel.

Qin Ming rubbed his hands, unable to bear it any longer.

The next instant, a straw rope appeared in Tang Jin's hand. It was pale yellow and looked ordinary, but suddenly it glowed with brilliant golden light, spreading and expanding forward as fast as lightning.

*Whoosh!* Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan both moved. Though they looked old, when they truly moved, they were like a thunderclap passing through. The entire training ground shook violently, rumbling.

They were like giant beasts moving, their large sleeves swaying, causing strong winds to howl. Qian Chuan, Cheng Rui, and others were nearly blown away, stumbling backward in shock.

They were too fast, blocking in front of the straw rope.

Tang Jin quickly withdrew her hand, feeling that the youth from Black White Mountain had truly become their precious treasure. She hadn't used a heavy hand, only wanted to bind him.

The purple-eyed raven, originally ready to watch a good show, was again stunned and said, "That rope from your teacher's rafters, wasn't it tying a... did you bring it out?"

"Another one," Tang Jin replied.

Everyone immediately understood. This was an exotic treasure refined by a Grandmaster. Facing an opponent of the same level with this was simply... unsolvable!

"Alright, today's sparring ends here," Zhao Minghui said, then personally went to talk to Qian Chuan, Tang Jun, and the others, sternly warning them not to speak carelessly.

Tang Jin put away the straw rope, looked at Qin Ming, and said, "Even in the First Realm of the New Life Path, you might not be unbeatable. The Night Mist World is vast and boundless. Never underestimate unknown opponents, not to mention other paths are flourishing, each still pioneering their own."

She only said that much, and the straw rope loosened, disappearing into her sleeve.

Qin Ming nodded upon hearing this.

Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan were already beaming with smiles. Looking at the youth before them, both elders were quite agitated, secretly sighing that perhaps there was still hope for the New Life Path.

Currently, this path's prospects were dim. For many years, no one had pioneered it. With several Ancestral Masters about to pass away, it was highly likely to be completely cut off.

Qin Ming felt genuine warmth. These two high-ranking elders truly liked him. They held his hand, carefully examined and felt his bones, repeatedly saying how good he was.

One of the elders' cloudy eyes even turned slightly red, showing a hint of sadness, saying, "Watching other paths, geniuses emerge one after another, brilliant figures constantly grow. Then looking at our New Life Path, for so many years, anyone who could shine even slightly eventually became someone else's follower. My heart, it truly aches."

Zhao Ziyuan said, "Old Yu has dedicated his life to teaching six disciples, treating them like his own sons and daughters. In the end, some died, some were crippled, and some couldn't endure the loneliness, couldn't bear the slow progress of this path, and simply disappeared. Alas."

Yu Gensheng's old eyes gazed into the distance, letting out only a soft sigh.

Then, he looked at Qin Ming and said, "We won't make demands of you. We only hope you can live on and go far enough on this path. Let nature take its course."

It was all because they had experienced too much, held too many expectations, and each time ended in disappointment. Geniuses died young, prodigies fell, and occasionally figures who briefly shone brightly suddenly withered.

Qin Ming said, "Thank you, two seniors, for valuing me. I am just a newcomer who has just embarked on this path. I have no grand, impassioned words. I just want to walk steadily, one step at a time."

"Good!" Both nodded. They were truly afraid he might become overly confident after defeating Ling Yu across realms, but seeing his current state, they felt quite relieved.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "Child, cultivation requires more sparring and exchange. You can't just close yourself off. In a while, I'll find you a top prodigy from Immortal Land so you can fully understand that path."

Yu Gensheng objected, saying, "At this stage, diligent cultivation is most important. Women will affect this child's speed of drawing his five-colored saber. Your descendant is a pearl and doesn't lack suitors, no need to be so hasty."

"You don't understand..."

...

Qin Ming was stunned, unable to interject.

Xiao Wu sidled over, full of envy. Even someone like Brother Ming, who seemed destined to live alone, was being fought over like this. When would his grandma's wish come true?

"These are the *Dragon Snake Scripture* and the *Flesh Body Nurturing Soul Art*," Tang Jin said, walking over and handing him two books.

Qin Ming gave the latter to Xiao Wu, while he held the *Dragon Snake Scripture* himself, quite excited. This was a miraculous art cultivated by Ancestral Master Qingtian, which ultimately granted him world-shaking divine strength, allowing him to hold up the heavens with his hands.

When Tang Jin handed over five golden notes, her fair fingers gripped them, reluctant to let go. These were all her own 'day gold', and it pained her immensely to have to give them all away.

Ling Yu lowered his head, not daring to look at her, only muttering, "Senior Sister, I'll pay you back later."

Qin Ming forcefully pulled out the golden notes, clutching them in his hand, a wide smile on his face, saying, "Fairy Tang, actually, I'm not very interested in day gold."

"Then give it back to me!"

Qin Ming nodded, "It's not impossible. Give me another miraculous art."

"I'll give you the *Undying Butterfly Scripture*," Tang Jin's eyes immediately lit up.

"No need, we have it here!"

The two elders shouted simultaneously. Did they still need to buy it? They had already exchanged for it long ago.

Tang Jin watched as the five golden notes were tucked into Qin Ming's bosom, her heart bleeding. Even a fairy needs day gold when walking in the mortal world.

"Sister Tang is really a good person," Xiao Wu laughed.

Instantly, the "good person" raised her fair fist, wanting to hit him and Qin Ming.

"Both of you, come here!" The two elders spoke simultaneously, with extreme seriousness.
