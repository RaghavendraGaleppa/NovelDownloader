Chapter 125: The Rebirth Manifestation! The Red Mole Between the Brows

Li Xian took the long sword, his wrist flipping as he twirled a sword flower. The sword hummed, exuding an air of潇洒俊逸 (free-spirited elegance).

Madam Wen’s bright eyes flickered. A white snake flew from her sleeve, but upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be a soft, slender long sword.

He had long anticipated the day their sword moves would combine.

The Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword was divided into a Yin Chapter and a Yang Chapter. Individually, neither was considered a top-tier sword art.

However, once combined, the complete sword manual became far more formidable than ordinary top-tier sword arts. When the two joined forces, the Yin and Yang energies intersected, invisibly nurturing the sword wielders.

Strengthening the body and fortifying the soul, extending one's lifespan, dispelling inner demons, healing injuries... The benefits were immense and numerous, enough to make one gasp.

Ever since Madam Wen obtained this sword art, she had frequently studied the manual, hoping to merge the combined moves into one...

So that she could practice it alone and enjoy all these miraculous benefits herself.

But top-tier sword arts are obscure and complex. The principles within range from the vastness of the universe to the pleasures between men and women—all of which Madam Wen could not comprehend.

Now, as their two swords first crossed, Madam Wen felt a tremor in her heart, the sensation from last time intensifying. "This boy is worthy of cultivation, but if he were to truly pair with me, he still lacks the qualification. It's just... it's rare to be able to practice this sword art, so I'll endure it for now. After all... his looks aren't bad."

She proactively launched her second sword strike.

"Madam, watch my sword!" Li Xian, filled with joy, cast aside his restraints regarding their status and尽情施展 (freely施展) his sword art.

At this moment, a sword thrust towards him, using the move "Tiger Falling on the Plain." This name had a story behind it. Legend has it that among the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple, the Yang Sword Master was a great genius of the world, but after suffering an injury, he lost all his martial prowess.

The Yin Sword Master did not comfort him; instead, she sought him out for sword duels every day, defeating him each time. Filled with resentment, the Yang Sword Master created this move, "Tiger Falling on the Plain."

Because of this, the move was designed to fight the strong with the weak. The sword slants downward, with a momentum like an injured tiger desperately pouncing to kill.

However, after later modifications, it became a flirtatious sword move for the couple to reminisce about the past.

Li Xian and Madam Wen were not the true Yin-Yang Sword Masters, but their current situation was quite similar. Naturally, Madam Wen used the move "Seizing the Tiger's Tail."

When Madam Wen practiced the "Yin Chapter Sword," she had felt it was inexplicable. The move "Seizing the Tiger's Tail" seemed abrupt and without reason, completely unlike a Yin Sword technique. She had never been able to grasp its essence.

Now, as their two swords met, she handled it with ease. Using her sword to guide, it was as if she were using her hand to seize a pouncing tiger. She swung her sword to the left; unable to match her strength, Li Xian could only move his body to the left.

It was just like a tiger falling on the plain, having its tail grabbed and being flung about. In her confused state of mind, Madam Wen became even more in sync with the Yin Sword Master.

Only then did she understand the essence of this sword move: it was not for killing the enemy, but for play.

She smiled faintly, her playful nature suddenly rising. She swung her sword left and right, as if an older sister teasing a mischievous child.

Madam Wen stood still, using only her sword to make Li Xian dodge left and dash right.

A heartless person cannot wield a sword of deep affection.
A deeply affectionate person cannot wield a heartless sword.

The era of the Yin-Yang Sword Couple was long past, and no one spoke of their life stories. But one could tell something from the sword art itself...

Madam Wen unconsciously merged into the sword art, her thoughts wandering. Although the two had no feelings for each other, the sword art was filled with emotion. The endless affection within the sword inevitably captivated the mind.

Since she entered the Jianghu, she had countless pursuers. The title "Madam Broken Sword" was both a reputation for beauty and a name for ferocity. But she had never once fallen in love.

She could shed her胎 (womb) and change her bones, but she was still herself. She cultivated a清心 (pure heart), yet she still had desires. Now,染上 (infected by) the emotions of the sword art, she felt a different kind of emotion.

She was completely unaware of it now, feeling only that it was strange, but she enjoyed it.

The subsequent sword movements slowed down. Madam Wen followed the flow and executed the move "Swearing to the Heavens." After this move, she actually felt the Qi in her entire body vanish.

She had sealed her own strength.

Madam Wen was stunned. At this moment, Li Xian charged forward with his sword. Even with her rich experience, she couldn't help but stumble in her steps.

It turned out that the sword move "Swearing to the Heavens" was a technique used by the Yin Sword Master to seal her own cultivation.

It was because the Yang Sword Master always lost in duels that he tricked the Yin Sword Master into swearing to the heavens not to use her cultivation or other moves, so they could compete using only the simplest sword techniques.

When used in actual combat, it seals the opponent's meridians and Qi as well. Its杀伤力 (lethality) is extremely powerful.

Li Xian was also affected by the sword's momentum, entangled by the lingering meaning of love. However, his will was firm; he was not swayed, knowing what he sought. A poor boy constrained by others, how dare he speak of love?

He also sensed that the Madam's sword had slowed.

Right now, he was一心 (wholeheartedly) wanting to drive the Madam back, a thought that coincidentally matched the Yang Sword Master's.

In the courtyard, the sound of the two swords clashing echoed.

With every clash, the Yang energy within Li Xian and the Yin energy within Madam Wen intersected along the blades, flowing back into their bodies.

It was an indescribable comfort.

"You want to defeat me? That's too premature." Madam Wen's sword art prowess was here; she truly had no reason to lose. She smiled as she thrust her sword, aiming for Li Xian's flaw.

Li Xian's "Setting Sun and Weary Blood Sword" happened to break through to [Minor Accomplishment] at this moment.

But the gap was too great. After parrying a few strikes, he still admitted defeat.

Madam Wen's brows relaxed, her red lips parting as if to speak. This time, Li Xian's sword dao had improved, making the combined swordsmanship much more satisfying and exhilarating than last time.

"Tomorrow, I will enter the tower to refine pills."

"The affairs of the manor are entrusted to you to manage."

"If you understand, then you may leave."

Madam Wen flicked her sleeve.

Li Xian got up and said, "Yes!" He took a few steps and then asked, "Madam, may I ask in advance, how long will it take you to refine the pills?"

Madam Wen said, "Perhaps thirty days. It is hard to say for sure."

Li Xian said, "Then I congratulate the Madam in advance on refining the precious pills."

Madam Wen glanced at the sky, seeing it was already late at night. She felt a bit dazed, so she sat cross-legged and adjusted her breathing.

This sword art was indeed miraculous, providing great benefits even to her.

As the prestigious Madam Broken Sword, she certainly wouldn't let her emotions be不由自主 (controlled) just by a sword art. Once she脱离 (broke free) from the sword's momentum, she would gradually detach herself.

However, the sense of closeness that arose naturally during the combination would linger involuntarily.

***

The next day.

The Madam entered the pill refining tower and began her seclusion.

Li Xian held great authority, managing the manor's operations. Don't underestimate this power. There were over four hundred guards, over a thousand miscellaneous workers, and adding up the servants, maids, cooks, and attendants, there were also a thousand or so.

Adding the tenant farmers and hired laborers outside the manor... all together, it was ten thousand, or even tens of thousands of people.

All of them listened to Li Xian's dispatch.

Li Xian steadily practiced his martial arts. Every two days, he would swallow a mouthful of refined meat to wash away the impurities of his physical body.

There was a pattern to consuming the refined meat. One could not binge, nor could one abstain; consuming it with discipline yielded the best results. Taking one mouthful every two days cleansed his body to be剔透 (crystalline and pure).

"Li Xian!"

That day.

Li Xian mounted his horse, intending to go out on patrol. On his return trip, he had seen traces of the rebel army. He didn't know where they were heading, but if they came to Qingning County, it would be disastrous.

He wanted to take advantage of the early hour to ride out and patrol further.

But just as he was leaving the manor, he was stopped by Qiuyue.

"Miss Qiuyue, what business do you have with me?" Li Xian asked.

"You rude fellow! How can you speak to someone without getting off your horse?" Qiuyue lifted her head and said haughtily.

Li Xian cupped his fists and said, "I am about to go on patrol, so it is inconvenient to dismount. If Miss Qiuyue has no urgent matter, I will listen attentively when I return." Seeing that Qiuyue seemed hostile, he didn't give her a good face either.

Qiuyue flew into a rage and stood in front of the horse to block him, saying, "Wait!"

Li Xian gently patted the horse's back and said, "If you have something to say, Miss Qiuyue, please speak directly."

Qiuyue said, "Hmph, I'm here to tell you. You'd better not get cocky." Li Xian asked, "What do I have to be cocky about?"

Qiuyue sneered, "What are you pretending for? The Madam is refining pills and has given you the authority to manage operations. You were originally a杂役 (menial laborer) who couldn't even afford food or a bath, but in a flash, you've become the Madam's assistant, your words determining the life or death of thousands in and out of the manor."

"You're probably feeling dizzy with power right now, extremely proud, feeling like you hold great authority and look imposing, aren't you?"

Li Xian smiled, having figured out Qiuyue's purpose, finding it ridiculous. "So what?"

Qiuyue angrily said, "Hmph, I'm telling you. Your achievements today are all because the Madam finds you novel. Once this novelty wears off, you'll be no different from Pang Long. The Madam's most important person is me!"

Li Xian laughed and said, "Alright, it's you." He squeezed the horse's belly and held the reins. The horse leaped, jumping right over Qiuyue's head.

The mud splashed, dirtying Qiuyue's dress.

"You!" Qiuyue was furious, her face turning青 (livid). She felt utterly disrespected.

But her martial arts were very low; what could she do? She could only watch Li Xian ride away潇洒 (潇洒ly), not even deigning to look at her.

Riding out of the manor, Li Xian galloped over ten miles, just to check for any traces of the Yellow Dragon Army.

"Qiongfu Prefecture is located in the southern region; compared to other prefectures and states, it is much more impoverished. In recent years, the Great Wu has been plagued by unrest, and rebel armies have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain."

"But those that actually reached Qingning County have never been seen before. I hope it will be the same this time."

Li Xian muttered to himself.

He galloped around but saw no sign of the rebel army, so he felt a bit relieved.

Only when it was completely dark did he ride back to the manor.

Thus.

Li Xian's life was peaceful and progressive. Although Qiuyue disliked Li Xian, she dared not refuse to cooperate. Firstly, she couldn't beat him. Secondly, the Madam's重视 (regard) for Li Xian was real. Qiuyue was adept at reading expressions; how could she not know?

That day...

The sky was clear for miles.

Inside the Leader's Courtyard.

Li Xian opened the treasure box, cut off a small piece of meat, and swallowed it... A steady stream of essence flowed through his body.

Li Xian's breathing was long and steady.

Thin impurities were washed out of his body. Li Xian was surrounded by清气 (pure energy), like a peerless immortal meditating in the mist.

To have such a strange phenomenon was enough to show that his true form was extraordinary.

Suddenly, his heart trembled... The pure energy surrounding him transformed into five-colored brilliance, entangling his body.

This was... having cleansed his body to be crystalline pure, the [Rebirth Manifestation] was revealed.

The Rebirth Manifestations of martial artists are千奇百怪 (varied and bizarre); there are good ones and bad ones. Every time a martial artist reveals their manifestation, it is no less than a great gamble.

But this great gamble is unavoidable.

Li Xian's breathing was long and悠长... Not long after, all the strange phenomena disappeared.

Only a red mole remained on his forehead.

His originally handsome face, with the revelation of his true form, became even more handsome, while also adding a layer of mystery.

"What kind of manifestation is this? I'll ask the Madam when she comes out." Li Xian touched the red mole on his forehead.

In some Buddhist physiognomies of his past life, there was also a red mole on the forehead, symbolizing compassion and wisdom. But the difference was, Li Xian's red mole was a slender vertical shape, and upon close inspection, it contained a faint golden hue.

It did not have a sense of universal compassion. Instead, it made his eyebrows and eyes look imposing and unique.

Looking at it in the bronze mirror, if one stared for a long time, one could also see a hint of something like a demon or an evil spirit.

"Strange, how could I, such an honest and upright man, have such a strange [Rebirth Manifestation]?" Li Xian rubbed his cheeks.
