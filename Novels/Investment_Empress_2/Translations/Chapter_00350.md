# Chapter 350: Aren't You Her Biggest Surprise?

Whoosh—

The heat waves surged. The Golden Crow projection was born. After breaking out of its shell, it transformed into a young man in his twenties. He wore a feathered robe of gold and red, his pupils like golden suns, and held a golden wheel in his hand.

"Please... guide me," Jiang Chulong said softly, her voice gentle and quiet.

The young man formed by the Golden Crow projection nodded slightly, suppressing his aura to the Xuan Dan Realm of Internal Qi.

Whoosh—

The golden wheel flashed with dazzling light, crushing forward with overwhelming force, extremely domineering.

Jiang Chulong had already mastered various sword techniques to perfection. Her grasp of the Dao of the Sword was enough to make many seniors feel ashamed. She countered with her most擅长 sword intent.

Clang—

The peach blossom branch and the golden wheel collided, sparking fire.

Jiang Chulong noticed a difference.

This projected opponent seemed different from before.

Previously, whether it was straw men or True Spirits, when suppressed to the same realm, she was mostly using them to temper her sword techniques and improve her proficiency in the Dao of the Sword.

But facing this Golden Crow projection, it was a real battle.

Little Princess Jiang felt immense pressure from this opponent.

"The fighting consciousness formed from the power of all living beings is actually so different?" Li Mo thought it felt a bit like playing a game.

Previous True Spirits were like bots, at best stubborn Bronze rank, while projections formed from the power of all living beings were like battling a King among real players.

Even using the same hero, some people can only play poorly, while others can dominate.

In terms of battle, this is the difference in combat awareness.

And what about himself?

To put it nicely, it's "one force suppresses ten thousand techniques"; to be blunt...

"I used to rely on overwhelming stats..."

The Heavenly尊 coughed lightly.

To be honest, in terms of technique, he might not even be comparable to Little Princess Jiang.

The ancient and magnificent Solar Golden Wheel danced up and down, weaving layers of scorching solar energy. Jiang Chulong tried her best to dodge at first, but gradually, there was almost no space left for her to move. Helplessly, she had to use all her Internal Qi, condense her sword intent, and fight head-on.

However, this was exactly what the opponent wanted.

With a *whoosh*, the golden wheel shot out diagonally. Before the peach blossom branch could pierce the Golden Crow youth, it was套在上面 (looped onto it). The scorching yang energy surged up along it.

Jiang Chulong let out a muffled groan, feeling as if the moisture in her body was being evaporated dry.

The peach blossom branch was also shaken out of her hand by the strange force in the center of the golden wheel.

"Teacher..."

Jiang Chulong bit her lip, her small face pale, afraid she had disappointed her teacher.

"This is the Primordial Golden Crow that once transformed into the Great Sun, illuminating the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. How could you defeat it so easily? Throughout history, those who could defeat it are probably few."

The Heavenly尊 teacher picked up the peach wood branch for her and said softly, "As long as you don't admit defeat, it's never a loss."

"This projection won't cause physical harm; it only makes your soul feel pain. Meditate for a while, then fight again."

Li Mo said these words to himself as well.

He rarely engaged in evenly matched battles.

Because he could rely on divine weapons and martial arts far surpassing his peers, using superior strength to suppress the weak.

But the fighting spirit of "Equaling Heaven" is a method of winning against a stronger opponent with a weaker one.

Only by bringing everything he has to the extreme can he advance his understanding of the Great Sage's Divine Will of Raising Havoc in the Heavenly Palace.

"Okay!" Jiang Chulong nodded seriously.

Little Princess Jiang looked soft and weak, but in reality, she had an unyielding spirit inside.

Before long, she was seriously fighting the Golden Crow projection again.

The chance for a life-and-death battle was precious because with one loss, there was no chance to try again.

But in the small world, as long as there was enough power of all living beings, one could summarize experience and start over countless times.

After a while, Little Princess Jiang went to recover her soul.

---

The diligent Golden Crow projection didn't have a moment to rest.

Waiting for it next was the Heavenly尊, who had taken the stage!

...

The next morning.

"Without the Hammer, I really couldn't win." Li Mo rubbed his temples and got up from the bed where the Ice Cube had slept.

Nine times, all lost.

This result was within Li Mo's expectations. The combat skills of a Primordial Being were simply beyond the scope of martial arts, or rather, some martial arts probably trace their origins back to being created based on them.

But he wasn't without gains.

Little Li Mo's hammer techniques, long since perfected, seemed to have gained new understanding.

Also.

His loins were still warm.

"Is this because of fighting the Golden Crow projection, or because of the clothes..." Looking down, Little Li Mo's handsome face turned red.

Old Chen Bo has been too energetic lately; he has to stay for a long time as soon as he comes...

Fortunately, the quality of this clothing was good; otherwise, with his current physique...

No wonder the Ice Cube said this outfit couldn't be worn alone for too long. Thinking back now, her expression at the time seemed to hold a hint of a knowing smile.

"Calm down, I should review and summarize the details of the battle just now."

"If only the Ice Cube were here. Every time I spar with her, I learn so much... If combat skills had ranks, she would definitely be King of Kings..."

Li Mo thought about it, and the image of that figure inevitably appeared before his eyes.

Holding a ruler, her cold and clear face was so serious it gave a sacred illusion.

But.

He should change out of these clothes later; otherwise, his attention might shift from the sacred teaching and instruction to lowly pleasures...

Jingle jingle—

The bell rang.

A girl from the Qingluan Clan poked her head out from the tree hole and made a gesture for eating.

So Li Mo followed her to the tallest tree.

The diet of the Qingluan Clan was simpler and more unadorned than Li Mo imagined. There was no meat; various fruits were served on leaves acting as plates.

"Clan Leader Shang, I plan to return to Qingmu City today."

"So soon?" Wu Qing couldn't help but raise her eyebrows.

Good sister asked Li Mo to stay in the Qingluan Clan territory to lay low for a while, but he's preparing to leave after just one night...

"Tsk tsk tsk, I knew he couldn't stay long," Shang Qinqing chuckled, revealing a profound smile.

"Little Bing'er is waiting for him in Qingmu City; how could he not be eager to return?"

Li Mo said seriously, "It's mainly because I have some questions about combat that I urgently need to ask her."

"Little Bing'er is probably holding her Sumeru artifact every day, staring into the distance in a daze."

"???"

"She did that often when she was in the Qingluan Clan territory, like a stone statue watching for her husband, lost in thought for ages," Shang Qinqing said, pretending to wipe away tears.

Li Mo immediately had a picture in his mind and murmured, "Before I go back, I'll make a cake for her birthday."

Shang Qinqing blinked and asked, "It's her birthday?"

"Yeah, I'm thinking about what surprise to give her..."

"Tsk, why are you as unenlightened as a little monk."

Shang Qinqing looked like an experienced person, confident and composed, her tone a mix of exasperation and disappointment.

"Aren't you her biggest surprise?"
