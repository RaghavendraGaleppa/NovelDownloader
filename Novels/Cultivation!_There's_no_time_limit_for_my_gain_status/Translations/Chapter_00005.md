# Chapter 5: Scale Demons  

"Look, look, what do we have here?"  

"Originally, I was going to invite my brother Jiang Li to share my tent, but it seems he's already found a better option."  

Yan Hong, with his round face, walked over with his hands behind his back, his tone dripping with sarcasm. He picked up the soup bowl from the tray, revealing a delicate handkerchief underneath—an unmistakable invitation in this era.  

"Get lost!"  

"I'm training tonight. You know how loud my snoring is. I'm perfectly fine staying in the carriage by myself."  

Jiang Li pocketed the handkerchief and firmly declined Yan Hong's dubious offer.  

Yan Hong was actually here to congratulate him. Among the young men and women in the caravan, Jiang Li's reputation had completely reversed—from a creepy, cowardly pervert to a resolute and vengeful young hero.  

Oddly enough, Jiang Li hadn't done anything particularly virtuous—his attempted peeping incident was real—but the moment he demonstrated his strength, the perception of him among his peers shifted dramatically.  

This phenomenon, however, was entirely predictable.  

Human nature is inherently self-interested. In social interactions, "value" is always the primary criterion by which others judge you.  

Even among friends, family, or lovers, people are subconsciously influenced by "value."  

So, things like character and morals? They don’t matter as much as people think. Especially when everyone is just passing acquaintances—who really cares about your moral compass? What they care about is your wealth, status, and influence.  

In this world, strength was the ultimate measure of value. Thus, after showcasing his abilities, Jiang Li had inadvertently become the object of many young girls' affections.  

Meanwhile, Yan Fengyue wasn’t having the best time lately.  

The friends who used to be close to her still acted friendly to her face, but behind her back, they whispered about how shameless she was for seducing men.  

The problem was, the campsites were small, and Yan Fengyue overheard these comments multiple times. The awkwardness was unbearable for a young girl.  

She couldn’t pretend not to hear, nor could she confront them directly. The frustration was eating at her.  

---  

Days passed as the journey continued. As they neared their destination, several caravans gradually merged.  

Jiang Li noticed that the emblems on the carriages were identical, and the robed cultivators conversed familiarly with one another. Clearly, all these caravans belonged to the same organization.  

The ever-resourceful Yan Hong took advantage of every rest stop to mingle with people from other caravans, exchanging information.  

Unfortunately, due to the cultivators' secretive nature—or perhaps their general disdain for mortals—Yan Hong gleaned little useful intel.  

All they learned was that these caravans belonged to an organization called the "Ascension Pavilion," which periodically dispatched teams to secular kingdoms to test and recruit children with spiritual roots.  

Speculation suggested that this was likely an intermediary organization connecting the mortal world to the cultivation realm. As for how vast its influence truly was, they had no way of knowing.  

Where there’s demand, there’s profit—and where there’s profit, someone will inevitably fill the gap.  

Being a middleman allowed for double-sided benefits. Regardless of anything else, the master of the Ascension Pavilion must have had a sharp business mind.  

Then, one evening when Jiang Li’s *Tiger Year Technique* broke through to Level 7, Yan Hong excitedly rushed over.  

"Jiang Li! Jiang Li! Come out, quick! I’ve got something amazing to show you!"  

Jiang Li slowly ended his cultivation session and sighed. He’d have to be more careful in the future—once the *Tiger Year Technique* reached the next level, it would generate internal energy. If he were interrupted like this again, he might end up coughing up blood.  

"My dear little prince, what’s got you so worked up? Unless you’re offering me a wife, I doubt I’d be interested."  

Jiang Li grumbled as he stepped out of the carriage.  

Lately, he’d been training whenever he had free time. Thanks to the persistent buffs he maintained, his stamina was always at its peak. If he didn’t burn off the excess energy through training, he’d feel unbearably restless.  

"None of that nonsense! Come with me—another caravan just joined us, and you won’t believe what’s inside."  

Yan Hong was practically vibrating with excitement as he dragged Jiang Li toward the rear of the caravan.  

"Let me guess—a golden-haired, blue-eyed Persian girl? A dark-skinned, curly-haired girl from the southern lands? Or maybe a girl with piercings all over her face? Yan Hong, is there anything besides girls that catches your attention?"  

"This time, I swear—it’s not a girl. Well, technically it is a girl… but not really… Just come with me!"  

Soon, Jiang Li realized something was off. This time, it wasn’t just Yan Hong and a few other perverts gathered around—almost the entire caravan, over two hundred people, had crowded around the newcomers.  

What could possibly draw such a crowd?  

And the atmosphere didn’t feel like people admiring someone—it was more like gawking at an exotic animal in a zoo.  

As Jiang Li and Yan Hong pushed through the throng, Jiang Li used his superior strength to muscle his way to the front.  

What he saw made him pause.  

The carriage wasn’t the usual enclosed type—it was a massive iron cage, its bars as thick as a thumb. Inside the cage was a wooden tub, the kind often seen in period dramas, about half a person’s height.  

Given the setup, was this some kind of ferocious beast?  

Jiang Li shot Yan Hong a questioning look.  

"What’s in there?"  

"Just wait—it’ll show itself soon."  

Yan Hong stood confidently at the front of the crowd.  

Some of the boys grew impatient and started reaching into the cage, slapping the wooden tub. Others tossed bits of leftover bread inside.  

"Hey, come out! If you don’t, I’m throwing rocks!"  

One particularly bold boy from another caravan actually picked up a stone.  

*Plop!*  

A fist-sized rock landed in the tub, and whatever was inside finally seemed to snap. Water splashed violently.  

"Anyone who values their life—get back!"  

A martial artist’s furious shout sent the rock-throwing boy tumbling onto his backside.  

The others didn’t dare cause any more trouble. Several black-clad martial artists appeared, forcefully dispersing the crowd.  

These would-be cultivators were, after all, just kids. Once intimidated, they quickly scattered. Jiang Li had no choice but to leave with the others.  

As he glanced back one last time, he caught a glimpse of a slender arm reaching out of the tub to grip the iron bars.  

"Alright, Yan Hong, now can you tell me what’s inside?"  

Yan Hong scratched his head sheepishly.  

"I don’t know exactly, but it’s definitely a demon—a water demon."  

Jiang Li sighed. He should’ve known better than to expect reliability from Yan Hong.  

"But… a demon, huh?"  

Jiang Li muttered the word to himself. He wasn’t sure if it was the kind of demon he imagined.  

---  

That night, under the pale moonlight, the camp was quiet.  

In one corner, Jiang Li’s carriage echoed with thunderous snoring—though it wasn’t actual snoring. If it were, his throat would’ve been shredded by morning.  

The sound came from the vibrations of his chest and skin. Under the effects of his *Body Strengthening* buff, his physique was steadily improving.  

Then, a soft, melodious voice drifted into his ears.  

So soothing… so gentle.  

It felt like returning to a mother’s embrace. The song wrapped around him, filling him with peace and comfort.  

All his guards dropped. Subconsciously, he relaxed his body. The *Tiger Year Technique*, which he’d been practicing nonstop, came to a halt without him realizing it.  

Lying on the hard wooden planks, he felt as if he were on a bed lined with eighteen layers of goose down. A contented smile spread across his face.  

Until—  

**[Affected by Scale Demon Song. Mental resistance failed. Hypnosis applied.]**  
**[Hypnosis: Perception reduced by 50%, mental acuity reduced by 50%, forcibly induced into deep sleep. Duration: 3 hours.]**  

The sudden appearance of these lines in his vision jolted Jiang Li awake—briefly.  

But… so… sleepy!  

The overwhelming drowsiness made him feel paralyzed, as if weighed down by an invisible force. His eyelids felt like they had two Yan Hongs sitting on them—impossible to lift.  

*No! Can’t fall asleep!*  

*Status! Remove the debuff!*  

Five seconds later, Jiang Li bolted upright, gasping for air. He’d come dangerously close to passing out.  

Thankfully, his status panel appeared directly in his vision—even with his eyes closed, he could see it clearly.  

"What the hell is going on?"  

The Scale Demon’s song continued outside. After listening for a few more seconds, Jiang Li felt his limbs grow weak again.  

He immediately removed the **[Hypnosis]** debuff, then grabbed some leftover bread from dinner, rolled it into balls, and stuffed them into his ears.  

The enchanting song became barely audible. Only then did he relax slightly.  

"Should I… go out and take a look?"  

"Seems risky."  

Torn between "curiosity kills the cat" and "fortune favors the bold," Jiang Li settled on a compromise.  

He’d drill a small hole in the carriage and peek outside.  

Carefully, he drew his sword and began boring into the wooden wall.  

With his strength far surpassing that of an ordinary person—and his sword being a rare treasure in the mortal world—the wood gave way easily. Soon, a small, inconspicuous hole appeared.  

Peering through it, he saw that the outside was shrouded in thick fog. Visibility was terrible—even the nearby campfire was barely visible.  

"The fog smells fishy!"  

*Rustle, rustle!*  

From the nearby woods, the underbrush shook violently, as if something large were moving through it. But with his ears plugged, Jiang Li couldn’t make out the sounds clearly.  

His instincts screamed danger. Gripping his sword tightly, he prepared for the worst.  

Moments later, shadowy figures emerged from the trees. Some headed straight for the carriage holding the "demon," while others crept toward the tents at the center of the camp.  

Jiang Li cursed inwardly. Those arrogant cultivators were nowhere to be seen when they were actually needed.  

Before the intruders got too close, he quietly opened the carriage door and slipped out.  

From the status prompt, the song was called *Scale Demon Song*, so the creatures producing it must be Scale Demons.  

Were they here to rescue their captured kin?  

The figures moved swiftly. The singing stopped abruptly, replaced by guttural growls.  

They pounced on the tents. The thick fabric offered no resistance as sleeping youths were dragged from their beds.  

By the time they woke, they found monsters feasting on their innards.  

One Scale Demon, seemingly drawn by something, sniffed the air and headed straight for Jiang Li’s carriage.  

Its breathing was ragged and harsh—nothing like the beautiful song from earlier.  

It yanked open the carriage door, peering inside in confusion when it found no one there.  

At that moment, a blade shot out from beneath the carriage, slicing through the demon’s legs.  

Fishy blood spilled as the creature collapsed.  

Jiang Li crawled out from under the carriage and took a closer look. To his surprise, the monster wasn’t ugly—it was actually quite beautiful.  

Pale, smooth skin framed a delicate, almost doll-like face. Long black hair, wet and clinging, accentuated its curvaceous figure.  

No wonder Yan Hong had described them as "girls."  

The only unsettling features were its pitch-black, oversized eyes and the rows of needle-sharp teeth it bared in a snarl.  

Jiang Li drove his sword through the demon’s chest, ending its life. Without hesitation, he sprinted toward Yan Hong’s tent—he’d seen several Scale Demons heading that way.  

The screams of dying youths pierced the night.  

Finally, from the direction of the cultivators’ quarters, voices rose in anger.  

"Damn it! This mission’s going to bankrupt me!"  

"Audacious demons! How dare you come ashore to die!"  

"Wake up, all of you!"  

The thunderous shouts vibrated the air, making Jiang Li’s eardrums ring.  

The noise finally roused the hypnotized crowd.  

Dazed and confused, the youths stumbled out of their tents, only to panic at the chaos outside.  

Not that their reactions mattered.  

Streaks of fire shot through the fog—burning talismans struck the Scale Demons, igniting them instantly.  

The waterlogged creatures writhed on the ground, unable to extinguish the flames.  

The black-clad martial artists, furious, charged into the fray. Against the relatively small and weak Scale Demons, they cut through them like wheat.  

With a collective screech, the demons turned to flee.  

White-robed figures flashed past, throwing different talismans this time. The struck demons stiffened and collapsed, immobilized.  

"Capture them alive!"
