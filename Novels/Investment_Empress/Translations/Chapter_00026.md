# Chapter 26: Young Peak Master of Rare Beast Peak, Fourth Floor of Divine Edge Cave

Time flowed on.

Ten days later, the young man walked into the Divine Edge Cave. His eyes mirrored the cold light within the cave, a sharp glint flashing for an instant. Yet, the harmless smile on his face almost made one believe that the momentary sharpness was merely an illusion.

"Yo, Core Disciple Li's here!"

"Junior Brother Murong was asking about you this morning."

"Tsk tsk, cultivating your body every day, Junior Brother Li, you must have a special physique just like Junior Brother Murong."

These past few days, the disciples of Divine Weapon Peak had all grown quite familiar with Li Mo. This was solely because Core Disciple Li had no airs, treating everyone with a refreshing kindness that made them feel as if they were bathed in a spring breeze. The last time someone was injured, had Core Disciple Li not promptly produced wound medicine, that inner disciple's hand might have been crippled. Thus, in just ten days, outsiders might even think Li Mo was the true core disciple of Divine Weapon Peak.

After greeting everyone, Li Mo walked through the corridor and entered the second floor of the Divine Edge Cave. He hadn't activated the Extreme Weapon Body Tempering Art, yet felt no discomfort whatsoever.

[Name: Li Mo]
[Age: 16]
[Root Bone: Xuanpin Immortal Physique.]
[Realm: Qi-Blood Realm, Eight Meridians.]
[Destiny: ??]
[Evaluation: Possessing an Immortal Physique, destiny is chaotic, future unknown.]
[Recent Encounter: Within the Divine Edge Cave, tempered body to peak mortal weapon level. One more step and it can reach the level of a sharp artifact.]

"If my physical body can be as tough as a sharp artifact, I can go down to the fourth floor and take a look." Li Mo mused. "If that doesn't work, I'll use martial comprehension to perfect my understanding of the Extreme Weapon Body Tempering Art."

In ten days, he had accumulated seventy-six years of martial comprehension. Not to mention perfection, if he invested all of it into the Extreme Weapon Body Tempering Art, it might even be pushed to the Grand Perfection stage. However, there was no need for that just yet. Horizontal cultivation emphasized 'practice'; to make progress, one had to diligently hone oneself day by day. Otherwise, no matter how strong the theory, it would remain just theory. Unlike sword arts, where every bit of progress added a corresponding amount of power.

Stepping onto the third floor, Li Mo walked to its end, took a Heart-Clearing Pill, and then sat down cross-legged.

...

At the entrance of Divine Edge Cave.

"Name." Sensing someone approaching, the inner disciple steward said without lifting his head.

"Yin Huacheng." The newcomer calmly stated his name.

The inner disciple steward's heart jolted, and he quickly stood up. Before him stood a young man in his twenties, slender, seemingly unable to quite fill out the cloud-patterned white robe. His features were handsome, but his complexion was sickly pale, and a black mole between his eyebrows made his demeanor appear much gloomier. Of course, what made the inner disciple steward act this way wasn't just Yin Huacheng's status as a core disciple. The current Peak Master of Rare Beast Peak also bore the surname Yin.

"So it's Core Disciple Yin. It's been a long time. Is Peak Master Yin doing well?"

"Heh, thank you for your concern." Yin Huacheng replied indifferently, lacking even the slightest interest in giving the inner disciple steward more face. Nevertheless, the steward took the waist token and quickly began recording.

"May I ask, Core Disciple Yin, your purpose in entering the Divine Edge Cave is..."

"Body tempering, retrieving a weapon."

[Yin Huacheng, Core Disciple of Rare Beast Peak.]
[Entering Divine Edge Cave, for body tempering and weapon retrieval.]

After the record was made, Yin Huacheng retrieved his waist token and stepped into the Divine Edge Cave.

"Core Disciple Yin? Hasn't he been away for a long time?"

"He must have just emerged from secluded cultivation recently, right? Could he have already condensed inner qi into form and stepped into the Spirit Contemplation Realm?"

"Hiss... hard to say."

"If Core Disciple Yin wants to temper his body, he should also be heading to the third floor."

"Haha, then he'll run into Core Disciple Li, won't he?"

The crowd on the first floor of the Divine Edge Cave couldn't help but start whispering amongst themselves. But before they could say more than a couple of sentences, their murmurs ceased. This was because, not far away, Yin Huacheng had turned around, his gaze sweeping across the Divine Weapon Peak disciples present. For some unknown reason, being looked at by him gave everyone the sensation of being targeted by a ferocious beast.

Yin Huacheng narrowed his eyes and asked, "When did the sect get another Core Disciple Li?"

"Uh, he's from this year's entrance ceremony, just joined our Qingyuan Sect," someone responded.
