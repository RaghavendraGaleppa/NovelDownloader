# Chapter 65: News of the Spirit Plant Master Elder

The Wine God Soul Tempering Technique was a secret method for cultivating spiritual energy. Gu Mo's knowledge from his previous life offered little assistance in this area, so his progress in mastering this technique was somewhat slow.

However, the effectiveness of the Wine God Soul Tempering Technique relied only partially on the cultivation method itself—the true key lay in the quality of spirit wine. As long as the spirit wine was of sufficiently high grade, the cultivation speed wouldn't lag.

Of course, a deeper understanding of the technique could improve the efficiency of utilizing spirit wine, which, to some extent, could also reduce the cost of cultivation.

After handing over the prepared 50 catties of Water Spirit Rice to Gou Youyu, Gu Mo received the spirit wine necessary for practicing the Wine God Soul Tempering Technique in return. With the transaction completed, Gu Mo began asking Gou Youyu about certain doubts he had regarding the technique.

Faced with Gu Mo's inquiries, Gou Youyu naturally answered every question thoroughly. He was well aware that forming a connection with Gu Mo could be a significant opportunity for him.

Opportunities weren't limited to just cultivation techniques, elixirs, or magical artifacts—sometimes, powerful or uniquely skilled cultivators themselves could become someone else's opportunity.

Gu Mo was now Gou Youyu's opportunity because he could provide high-grade spirit rice like Water Spirit Rice, which Gou Youyu could use to brew spirit wine, practice the Wine God Soul Tempering Technique, and enhance his cultivation.

"By the way, Shopkeeper Gou, do you have any information on disguise techniques or clone-based secret methods?" After having his doubts about the Wine God Soul Tempering Technique clarified, Gu Mo suddenly thought to ask.

Previously, Gu Mo had been an unnoticed outer disciple, but as his reputation gradually spread within the Spirit Plant Hall, more and more people would come to know of him. This made Gu Mo feel it was time to acquire a disguise technique to make his outings more convenient.

Of course, it would be best if he didn't have to leave at all. Currently, within his spirit fields, Gu Mo could ensure that even early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators wouldn't return alive. But if he encountered a Foundation Establishment cultivator outside his fields, it would be Gu Mo who wouldn't make it back.

The combat effectiveness of Gu Mo at home versus outside were on entirely different levels. After all, whether it was the Peashooter or the Potato Mine, both were more suited for defensive battles.

However, completely avoiding outings was unrealistic. But if he could obtain a clone technique, this problem could be solved.

"Disguise techniques shouldn't be too difficult to find with some inquiries. But clone-based secret methods—those are much rarer," Gou Youyu pondered before answering.

For rogue cultivators who lacked a sense of security, mastering a disguise technique was an essential tool for both daily life and travel. Thus, obtaining one wouldn't be too hard for Gu Mo. Clone techniques, however, were far less common.

"No problem. Please keep an ear out for me, Shopkeeper Gou. If you hear anything, let me know." Gu Mo waved his hand dismissively. This was just a passing thought—if he could find such a technique, great; if not, it wasn't urgent like the need for a concealment technique, without which he couldn't cultivate at full capacity.

"Understood!" Gou Youyu nodded.

With his business concluded, Gu Mo left the market and returned to his spirit fields on his flying sword. Now that he had a proper flying sword, the time it took to travel back and forth had shortened considerably.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo!"

Not long after returning, Mai Yunfa arrived and handed Gu Mo a heavy bag containing a full 5,000 spirit stones.

Gu Mo had left 50 catties of Water Spirit Rice with Mai Yunfa for auction, meaning each catty had sold for 100 spirit stones—a price that was undoubtedly high. This was likely due to it being the first auction; the price would likely stabilize lower in the future.

"Senior Brother Mai, thank you!" Gu Mo handed 1,000 spirit stones to Mai Yunfa as his commission. Mai Yunfa didn't decline—unlike the wealthy inner disciples of the sect, 1,000 spirit stones was a significant sum for an outer disciple like him.

"Heh, Junior Brother, I won't take your generosity for nothing." After accepting the spirit stones, Mai Yunfa lowered his voice mysteriously. "Junior Brother, I heard that the sect's third-tier Spirit Plant Master Elder will be ending his seclusion early. So, it won't be long before we can receive the Spirit Plant Master's teachings."

"Ending seclusion early?" Gu Mo couldn't hide his surprise. Cultivators rarely ended their seclusion prematurely unless something important had occurred.

"I'm not entirely sure, but I heard the sect master recalled the elder from seclusion." Mai Yunfa scratched his head. He had learned this from Deacon Zhao and didn't know the specifics. But if the third-tier Spirit Plant Master Elder emerged from seclusion, disciples like them who qualified for the lectures would soon receive his teachings.

This was their only path to becoming true Spirit Plant Masters. If they could gain any insights from the elder's lectures, their status would skyrocket.

"Thank you for the heads-up, Senior Brother Mai."

Seeing that Mai Yunfa didn't know much more, Gu Mo suppressed his curiosity and thanked him. Matters concerning Golden Core elders were far beyond the reach of outer disciples like them.

"I'll let you know as soon as I hear more details." Mai Yunfa assured him before taking his leave.

With Mai Yunfa gone, Gu Mo returned to tending his spirit fields, planting a new batch of Water Spirit Rice. Afterward, he practiced the Wine God Soul Tempering Technique, collected solar essence to upgrade his Sunflowers, and occasionally studied Spirit Farmer spells. Unlike other cultivators who had to train arduously, Gu Mo had plenty of free time.

His current plan was to first upgrade five Sunflowers to the second tier before focusing on cultivation. The reason he chose five instead of all fifteen was simple—five second-tier Sunflowers were more than enough for his cultivation needs, whether for personal advancement or upgrading his Peashooters and Potato Mines.

While more second-tier Sunflowers could further increase his cultivation speed and reduce upgrade times for his plants, the time required to upgrade them all would be excessive. Just upgrading five would take about a year; upgrading all fifteen would likely take at least two and a half years.

Gu Mo could wait two and a half years, but the issue was that the vending machine in the Black Mist Space counted both first-tier and second-tier solar essence as a single unit when making purchases. Given this, Gu Mo naturally chose to use first-tier solar essence to buy new plants, so he kept ten first-tier Sunflowers for that purpose.

Currently, Gu Mo only had Sunflowers, Peashooters, and Potato Mines, but the vending machine clearly offered more. He was quite eager to see what new plants he could acquire, but for now, upgrading his Sunflowers took priority.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo!"

Amid his peaceful routine, Mai Yunfa appeared once more—this time with major news about the Spirit Plant Master Elder.
