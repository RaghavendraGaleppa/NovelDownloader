# Chapter 129: The Large Hammer is Eighty, The Small Hammer is Forty

Two figures walked out from within the dense forest.

The young man’s clothes were spotless, completely unlike someone who had just survived a life-or-death trial, but rather as if he had simply come out for a spring outing.

Behind him followed a tower-like man, acting as a bodyguard.

Li Mo casually tossed a watermelon rind to the ground and asked in confusion:

"Old Xiao, Junior Brother Tang, what are you guys..."

"Junior Brother Li, this秘境 (Mysterious Realm) is full of hidden dangers, so I had to resort to this desperate measure."

Xiao Qin couldn't help but reveal a bitter smile.

This method was actually taught by his teacher.

Looking like a mud monkey is still better than being discovered by those powerful white bone beasts.

Speaking of which, what is going on with Junior Brother Li?

He looks like he barely even lifted a finger, yet he obtained so many Beast Tokens.

"Junior Brother Li, you came at the perfect time."

"We were just about to go pick the Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass."

Tang Xiaobao felt confident now.

His trump card had arrived.

If he used the 'Fusion Technique' with Junior Brother Li, that white bone gorilla with the strongest aura would be nothing to worry about.

Li Mo looked over and saw the red spirit grass hidden behind the waterfall.

His gaze swept over the pile of white bone gorillas in front of the waterfall, stopping on the largest one.

Mid-stage Rank 7?

Much stronger than that Tree Demon King, and it isn't exactly countered by Nether Fire.

"That mid-stage Rank 7 White Bone Gorilla is mine."

As soon as the words fell.

The Chixiao at Li Mo's waist suddenly unsheathed, transforming into a fiery ribbon as it slashed toward the White Bone Gorilla King.

Tie Qi followed closely behind. They had encountered beasts blocking their path along the way, so no words were needed.

"Junior Brother Li is still so fond of helping others."

"The gap between me and him seems to be getting even wider."

Xiao Qin sighed in his heart.

"Focus on the enemy."

The aged voice of the Thousand-Form Martial Sovereign sounded in his ear:

"With the support of the Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass, I can teach you a complete divine art."

"The Divine Perception Realm is where you will truly shine."

"Understood."

While speaking, Xiao Qin had already moved forward to face a Rank 8 Late Stage White Bone Gorilla.

The battle broke out instantly.

"Let's start with the sword."

Li Mo’s mind was completely focused at this moment.

No martial art is perfected by just practicing in isolation. To truly make it your own, one must constantly experience real combat.

He discovered that after actual combat, using Martial Dao Insights to deduce techniques would cost fewer insights.

The Way of the Sword has always been his biggest investment in Martial Dao Insights.

But there was no other choice; this was also his greatest source of Martial Dao Insights.

He could only think of ways to increase the profit.

"Mountain Peak!"

Li Mo’s sword tip trembled, and countless sword intents condensed on the Chixiao.

The momentum was majestic, covering the entire space in front of him.

A superior sword art, used by him to the perfection stage.

"Roar!"

The White Bone Gorilla noticed a tiny thing provoking it and immediately became human-like in its anger, pounding its chest bones with a loud clatter.

It raised its elbow to counterattack, smashing the sword intent-formed giant sword back.

This Rank 7 Mid-Stage White Bone Gorilla possessed very high intelligence. Although it couldn't use martial arts like a martial artist, it could use things similar to 'fighting techniques' and even knew how to use tools.

For a time.

Junior Brother Li dodged and weaved, using various sword arts to fight the giant gorilla in a heated battle.

The battle on Old Xiao's side was much simpler.

Mainly because he had Tie Qi, a Two-Aperture Divine Perception Realm expert, as a helper.

Every strike of his halberd not only carried terrifying physical strength but also the killing intent of the battlefield.

Half an hour later.

Li Mo finally finished practicing all the superior sword arts he had perfected in actual combat.

Looking over at Xiao Qin's side, they were almost done as well.

"Relying solely on sword arts, it's still very difficult to defeat an enemy who is a whole major realm higher in a short time..."

"Using the Sun Wheel Sword Canon is also hard to kill."

Li Mo stopped and stood still.

Don't look at how the gorilla looks miserable, covered in wounds; it actually hasn't been hit in a vital spot. On the contrary, because Li Mo kept kiting it, it became increasingly annoyed and狂暴 (frenzied).

"Roar..."

---

The White Bone Gorilla saw the little bug stop moving, and a strange arc actually appeared at the corner of its mouth.

This little bug dared to fight it head-on; it must be afraid of its strength.

Is it unable to run now?

*Boom—*

It picked up a large bluestone and smashed it directly at Li Mo's head.

"About right."

Under the strong wind pressure.

Li Mo’s robes fluttered, but he showed no panic.

He didn't raise his sword to counterattack; instead, he put away the Chixiao. His left hand hung slightly down, his entire body bent like a bow, all power converging.

*Stabilize the Wild Waves.*

This was the hammer that instantly killed Yin Huacheng.

*Seven Stabilizes the Universe* is a masterpiece, and when executed by Junior Brother Li, it reached the state of perfection.

The air solidified and thickened, as if a storm was approaching, pressing down on people until they couldn't breathe.

The youth's sleeve struck out.

No, it wasn't the sleeve.

It was the hammer inside the sleeve.

The gorilla forcefully halted its attack, raising its arms to block.

*Boom—*

An unstoppable hammer, crushing the two white bone arms with overwhelming force.

"Pretty tough."

Li Mo raised an eyebrow.

The bodies of exotic beasts are indeed much stronger than a human's. Moreover, he didn't use World Force, nor did he use a divine weapon.

*Star Seed Pestle* is the small hammer, the small hammer is forty.

*Panjie Falling Star Hammer* is the large hammer, the large hammer is eighty.

If one hammer doesn't solve it, then two hammers—Young Master Li.

"Forty!"

*Bang—*

The hammer hidden in the sleeve struck again.

The White Bone Gorilla stood at attention.

Its head exploded instantly. The force even penetrated its entire body, hitting the ground and cracking the earth in several concentric circles.

"A Divine Perception Realm martial artist, although their body is weaker, has Divine Intent added to them."

"Two strikes from the small hammer should be enough."

Li Mo rubbed his chin and put the Star Seed Pestle back into the System Space.

He lowered his head and casually picked up the Beast Token on the ground. Well, this thing is pretty useless to him now anyway.

Xiao Qin and Tie Qi looked at the traces of Li Mo's battle and fell into silence.

Seriously.

Brother Li, why didn't you just use this move from the beginning?

Speaking of which, what was that just now? I couldn't see it clearly?

It couldn't really be that he struck with his sleeve, right?

Li Mo realized it too.

The area around the waterfall and pond, which originally had decent scenery, was now a mess.

"Wait!"

Li Mo suddenly remembered, he hadn't picked the Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass yet.

The waterfall was smashed up like this, is the spirit grass okay?

Without that thing, the investment can't be done.

Li Mo quickly landed in front of the pile of rubble at the waterfall, searching through it.

"Junior Brother Li, what are you looking for?"

"Grass! (A type of plant)"

"Oh oh, I already picked it."

Tang Xiaobao raised his small hand, holding the blood-red spirit grass. He laughed:

"While you guys were fighting, I went early to secretly pick the grass."

"Great job, Junior Brother Tang."

Li Mo gave him a thumbs up:

"From now on, no one can say you're simple-minded."

"Exactly, exactly."

Tang Xiaobao happily raised his head.

Just at this moment.

The words in the sky changed.

【First Layer Trial Concluded.】

【Those who passed the trial, gather according to the guidance.**

*Buzz—*

In the distance, a beam of light shot up into the sky.
