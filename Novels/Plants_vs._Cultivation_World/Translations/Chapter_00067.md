# Chapter 67: The Elder's Teaching  

"Apologies, junior brother, but this seat is taken by your senior." As the only inner sect disciple present, Shan Yu was undoubtedly the strongest among them. Naturally, he had claimed the central position in the front row first.  

The other outer sect disciples tacitly chose to compete for the remaining cushions without challenging him. Seeing no one contest his spot, Shan Yu smiled faintly. Among inner sect disciples, he might be average, but among outer sect disciples, he was undeniably a genius.  

Thus, Shan Yu was confident in gaining the recognition of the Spiritual Plant Elder. After all, he possessed the highest talent in this group and had already mastered four of the five Spiritual Farmer spells—only the Minor Revitalization Technique remained beyond his grasp.  

With such foundations, Shan Yu was brimming with confidence that he would become a certified Spiritual Planter. Surely, he wouldn’t be inferior to those two outer sect disciples from the Spiritual Planting Hall. If they could qualify, there was no reason an inner sect disciple like him couldn’t.  

Becoming a Spiritual Planter would greatly aid his bid for the position of a true disciple. The Green Dew Sect was currently in dire need of Spiritual Planters, and the sect provided additional resources to those who excelled in this field. If he could become the sect’s strongest Spiritual Planter after the elder—who was merely a guest elder and not a core member of the sect—he stood a solid chance of being promoted to true disciple.  

The Spiritual Planting Elder would eventually leave, as guest elders were not permanent fixtures. When that time came, it would be Shan Yu’s moment to rise. In the future, he might even become the master of the sect’s Spiritual Planting Peak.  

The competition for the cushions in the hall was fiercer than expected. Of course, since spells and magical artifacts couldn’t be used inside, the disciples could only rely on physical strength.  

With Gu Mo’s physique being six times stronger than that of his peers, he could have easily secured a prime spot—except perhaps against the inner sect disciple. But Gu Mo chose a cushion in the back row without any intention of joining the scramble. In his view, competing for seating was meaningless. To a Golden Core cultivator’s divine sense, distance made no difference. Whether one sat right in front or miles away, it would all feel the same.  

Attracting the elder’s attention wasn’t about proximity—it was about talent.  

Though the competition was intense, it didn’t last long. Soon, everyone had settled into their seats.  

To Gu Mo’s surprise, Mai Yunfa had secured a spot right next to the inner sect disciple—one of the best positions available.  

"Whew—"  

With the seating settled, Mai Yunfa exhaled deeply before turning to nod in gratitude to his fellow outer sect disciples from the Spiritual Planting Hall. His prime position was only possible because of their help.  

Of course, their assistance was partly due to Steward Zhao’s influence. When it came to Mai Yunfa—a junior with family ties—Zhao Qiancheng always lent a hand at critical moments.  

The other outer sect disciples from the Spiritual Planting Hall couldn’t help but envy him. Unfortunately, none of them had a steward as a relative.  

"Hmm?"  

While thanking his peers, Mai Yunfa also noticed Gu Mo sitting at the very back. He was momentarily taken aback, but then he remembered that Gu Mo was merely a servant disciple. Though his talent in spiritual farming was decent, his cultivation and physique likely couldn’t compete with the outer sect disciples. It wasn’t surprising that he ended up in the worst spot.  

Mai Yunfa sighed inwardly. He had only secured his own seat with the help of his peers—and that was only because of Steward Zhao’s influence. Otherwise, who would sacrifice their own prospects to help someone else at such a crucial moment?  

He sat back down, thinking that Gu Mo still had a good chance of becoming a Spiritual Planter. But with the worst seat, that chance had diminished significantly.  

This seemingly simple competition for seating was, in truth, a test of strength. Only the most outstanding disciples could claim the best spots.  

When the time came, the Spiritual Planting Elder would naturally focus more on those with the greatest talent.  

"The elder is arriving! Everyone, settle down!"  

Before long, Song Xing and Li Jinmei reappeared, calling out to the disciples before taking their positions at the side.  

At the news of the elder’s imminent arrival, many outer sect disciples grew excited. Golden Core elders were not easily accessible to them—some had never even seen one before.  

After a few breaths, a figure clad in a green robe embroidered with mysterious plant patterns appeared. The robe’s material alone marked it as a high-quality magical artifact.  

The man wearing it was middle-aged, his face bearing traces of weariness, and his dark green hair stood out prominently.  

"Greetings, Elder Qi!"  

The moment the green-robed elder appeared, the disciples rose and bowed in unison.  

Qi Chunde’s gaze swept over the hall, pausing briefly on Gu Mo before moving on.  

"Whew—"  

As the elder’s gaze shifted away, Gu Mo exhaled in relief. He knew his concealed cultivation had been detected. His Mastery-level Concealment Technique could fool Foundation Establishment cultivators, but not a Golden Core elder.  

However, the elder didn’t seem to care. At the fourth level of Qi Refining, Gu Mo’s cultivation was merely average among the outer sect disciples present.  

What had actually drawn Qi Chunde’s attention wasn’t Gu Mo’s cultivation level—it was his sixfold foundation compared to his peers and the servant disciple robes he wore.  

The combination was odd. With such profound foundations, why was he dressed as a servant disciple? Shouldn’t he be wearing inner sect robes?  

But the elder quickly dismissed the thought. He had no time to investigate the secrets of a mere Qi Refining disciple.  

"Next, I will teach you the cultivation methods of a Spiritual Planter. How much you comprehend depends entirely on your own understanding."  

Qi Chunde’s voice carried clearly to every disciple as he began explaining the essence of being a Spiritual Planter—how to nurture, fuse, and enhance spiritual plants.  

His words seemed imbued with a mystical power, each syllable imprinting itself firmly in the listeners’ minds.  

The disciples on their cushions listened with rapt attention, striving to grasp the elder’s teachings. But soon, frowns began appearing on many faces.  

As Qi Chunde continued, confusion grew among the crowd. For instance, his explanation of fusing two entirely different spiritual plants into one left many baffled. How could two completely distinct plants be merged?  

In contrast, Gu Mo found this concept entirely logical. Wasn’t plant fusion just grafting? What was so hard to understand?  

Admittedly, the elder’s description of spiritual plant fusion differed slightly—okay, maybe more than slightly—from the grafting Gu Mo knew. But the underlying principle seemed the same.
