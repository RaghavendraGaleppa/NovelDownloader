# Chapter 49: South Mountain Pavilion and the Little Colossus Wood  

"Buzz!"  

Gu Yuan instinctively gathered his magical power to shield himself.  

However, the fragrant breeze that rushed toward him carried no hostility—only a stunningly beautiful woman. Her skin was fair and delicate, and she wore a long pink dress. Her aura hovered between that of a maiden and a mature woman, blending youthful charm with a touch of allure.  

"Are you visiting the market for the first time, honored guest?"  

"Would you like a guide? I've lived in this market since childhood and am very familiar with the surrounding hundred-mile radius. For just one spirit stone, I can help you explore every corner."  

Her voice was crisp and pleasant to the ear.  

Gu Yuan looked up and saw a rather attractive woman cautiously studying him. Behind her stood several other equally beautiful women who had been a step too late, their faces filled with regret as they lingered nearby.  

"Honored guest, the Moon Bamboo Market is vast, with countless shops of varying quality. Hiring a guide can save you a lot of trouble."  

The woman raised her head, pleading with Gu Yuan.  

Gu Yuan glanced at the numerous pavilions and shops hidden among the bamboo groves, then at the other cultivators on the street, each accompanied by a similarly dressed woman in pink. After a moment, he nodded.  

When first entering a large market, hiring a guide was common practice.  

After all, this was no small-scale affair like Half-Moon Bay. Spanning hundreds of miles with countless shops, it resembled a small city. Without a knowledgeable guide, navigating it alone would indeed be time-consuming and laborious.  

Since he had already paid six spirit stones as an entry fee, what was one more?  

Gu Yuan flicked his wrist, and a spirit stone landed in the woman's palm.  

"Thank you, honored guest! Thank you!"  

The woman carefully stored the spirit stone and bowed repeatedly in gratitude.  

She was no ordinary mortal but a cultivator herself, albeit of low cultivation—only at the second level of Qi Refinement. Likely the descendant of a cultivator and a mortal, her spiritual roots were mediocre, leaving her with few options beyond odd jobs to earn spirit stones.  

"May I ask if you've come to purchase or sell, honored guest?"  

Once the spirit stone was secured, the woman immediately got to work, softly inquiring.  

"Both."  

Gu Yuan answered lightly before asking in return, "I came here seeking a particular technique called the 'Soul Contract Method.' Do you know where it might be sold?"  

He made no attempt to conceal his purpose, asking directly.  

He wasn’t afraid of revealing his identity.  

The Moon Bamboo Market was established by a Golden Core cultivator. Like the Celestial Star Black Market, the six-spirit-stone entry fee not only ensured the safety of visitors but also guaranteed a degree of privacy.  

The moment Gu Yuan stepped into the market, a leafy green mask had appeared on his face, obscuring his features and aura. Unless someone possessed Golden Core-level divine sense, no one could discern his true identity—a feature strikingly similar to the Celestial Star Black Market.  

---  

"The Soul Contract Method?"  

The woman was slightly startled.  

A guide in such a market naturally had some knowledge. The Soul Contract Method was an exceedingly rare technique, typically used only for binding exotic beasts or mysterious astral spirits.  

Astral spirits were far too extraordinary—could this guest have acquired some rare spirit beast?  

Though curious, she dared not pry. After a brief moment of thought, she replied, "Honored guest, this technique is quite unique. I can't guarantee it's available in the market, but if any place might have it, it would be the 'South Mountain Pavilion.'"  

"This pavilion has a vast network, with branches in many markets across the South Mountain Domain. Though each branch offers different magical treasures and materials, their techniques and manuals are interconnected."  

"Even if only one branch is present, it can communicate with the entire South Mountain Domain."  

Gu Yuan had heard of the South Mountain Pavilion.  

Rumor had it that this organization possessed a "Mountain-Sea Seal" passed down for thousands of years. This seal could split into 365 lesser seals, allowing communication and even the transmission of techniques across vast distances—an incredibly profound artifact.  

It was precisely because of this that the pavilion had grown so powerful, extending its influence throughout the South Mountain Domain.  

Even in desolate lands and territories ruled by demon kings where humans rarely ventured, traces of this pavilion could be found.  

"Does this pavilion buy magical artifacts as well?"  

Gu Yuan asked further.  

"Indeed they do, honored guest. However, they don’t accept all artifacts—those of dubious origin may be refused."  

The woman answered softly.  

"Then let’s visit this pavilion first."  

Gu Yuan waved his hand.  

"Please follow me, honored guest!"  

The woman bowed gracefully before leading the way with elegant steps.  

---  

The South Mountain Pavilion wasn’t far. After a short walk, they arrived before a grand, six-story building.  

A blue-robed attendant at the fifth level of Qi Refinement hurried out to greet them.  

"Your esteemed presence honors us, honored guest! What might you be seeking today?"  

The attendant was exceedingly polite as he inquired.  

"The Soul Contract Method."  

Gu Yuan wasted no time on pleasantries, cutting straight to the point.  

"The Soul Contract Method?"  

The attendant was briefly surprised but quickly smiled. "You’ve come to the right place! Other shops might not have it in stock, but when it comes to techniques and manuals, our South Mountain Pavilion will surely satisfy your needs!"  

"However, this matter is beyond my authority. Please wait a moment while I summon the manager."  

The attendant served spiritual tea before fetching a ninth-level Qi Refinement elder.  

With the elder’s involvement, the deal was swiftly concluded.  

---  

The elder, possessing the authority of a Mountain-Sea Seal fragment, could communicate with other branches. He quickly located this rare technique for Gu Yuan.  

The price, however, was steep—a full hundred spirit stones, enough to purchase a top-grade magical artifact.  

Fortunately, Gu Yuan had struck it rich during his time at the Shell Field, or he might not have been able to afford it.  

Not only that, but at the South Mountain Pavilion, Gu Yuan also sold off the unused magical artifacts and pills in his storage bag, netting him 330 spirit stones in total.  

The price was naturally discounted—after all, they were "hot goods," so some haggling was to be expected.  

After all was said and done, Gu Yuan’s spirit stones hadn’t diminished but had instead grown to 400.  

This was the wealthiest he had been since entering the Dao Academy.  

"Esteemed elder, does your pavilion happen to sell Sword Armor Wood, Phantom Star Flowers, or Little Colossus Wood?"  

Gu Yuan took a sip of spiritual tea before asking the elder.  

Having just closed a lucrative deal, the elder was in good spirits and aware of the young man’s financial standing. Thus, he maintained a warm smile.  

However, upon hearing the names of these rare plants, he could only offer a helpless smile.  

"You’re a step too late, honored guest. Just two days ago, we had one Phantom Star Flower and one Sword Armor Wood in stock. But recently, the Falling Clouds Sect launched a campaign against the Thunder Peaks, and all such rare woods have been sold out."  

Gu Yuan’s expression fell slightly at the news.  

But the elder quickly added, "However, tomorrow the market will host an auction. I’ve heard a little in advance—among the items up for bidding will be a seed of the Little Colossus Wood. If you’re interested, you might want to wait until then."  

"Be warned, though—the Little Colossus Wood is a key ingredient for the 'Colossus Seal.' There may be cultivators from the Falling Clouds Sect competing for it, so you should prepare yourself mentally."  

"The Falling Clouds Sect? They specialize in thunder seals—since when have they delved into strength-based techniques?"  

Gu Yuan was puzzled.  

The Falling Clouds Sect was renowned for its thunder seals, a school of orthodox spellcasting. He had never heard of any of its disciples practicing strength-based seals.  

After all, strength-based seals were exceedingly rare. Without a complete lineage, progress was difficult, making them an unpopular choice.  

"That was indeed the case before," the elder explained. "But recently, when the Falling Clouds Sect breached the Thunder Peaks, they discovered an ancient ruin containing a legacy of strength-based seals. Many disciples have benefited from it—one even at the ninth level of Qi Refinement used it to break through to Foundation Establishment."  

"These days, materials related to strength-based seals are in high demand."  

"The auction may see some fierce bidding!"
