# Chapter 13: A Perilous Possession Attempt

As Qin Chong fled, his mind raced with calculations. The Flying Cloud Waterfall was just ahead. This time, he descended directly along the waterfall's torrent before plunging into the deep pool below, diving toward the bottom. However, he immediately encountered tremendous buoyancy that made descending difficult.

But this didn't deter him. He summoned the Greenwater Sword to match his body size, embracing it as he forced his way downward.

His pursuer, seeing Qin Chong dive straight into the water, momentarily froze before sneering, "Seeking your own death. Let's see how long you can last underwater. This gives me time to recover my energy anyway."

Coincidentally, the man settled cross-legged on the very spot where Huo Yuanliang had sat during Qin Chong's previous visit.

Qin Chong hadn't expected to return to Little Cang Mountain so soon, nor to find himself in such a similar predicament—last time pursued by a demon beast, this time by a cultivator.

Soon reaching the pool's bottom, Qin Chong entered the stone chamber from before. Though temporarily safe, he knew this situation differed from last time. Huo Yuanliang had merely coveted the Blood Spirit Fruit, whereas this man clearly sought his life.

Zhao Yin had warned him, yet here he was facing this very danger.

Qin Chong worried his pursuer might follow him underwater. Though the chamber's entrance had a barrier, he doubted it could stop the man—after all, he himself could pass through freely.

As he restored his energy, Qin Chong kept watch on the entrance while pondering the attack. Was this simply a chance encounter with someone seeking to kill and rob him? Yet the man's behavior suggested prior knowledge of him, ruling out pure coincidence.

Could the Canglong Valley have set a hidden trap? Perhaps they'd released a dozen cultivators only to hunt them down afterward, reclaiming thousands of spirit stones while seizing their possessions. Though most Qi Condensation cultivators had little wealth, a dozen combined represented substantial resources. However, such large-scale slaughter would carry severe consequences if any survivors spread word, damaging Canglong Valley's reputation irreparably. Even as an inner disciple, Huang Fei couldn't shoulder that responsibility—though the temptation of cultivation resources made it possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the Canglong Valley cultivators were being targeted themselves, and Qin Chong and the others were merely collateral damage in someone's scheme to silence witnesses.

After hours of contemplation, these remained the only plausible explanations. Without certainty, Qin Chong resolved to question Zhao Yin thoroughly if he survived this ordeal, lest similar troubles arise later.

Half a day passed with no movement in the waters above. His pursuer apparently hadn't followed, as the Flying Cloud Pool's limited size would have made the chamber easy to locate given time.

After a full day, Qin Chong's energy had mostly recovered, but he saw no reason to leave. Why rush to certain death when he could wait here in safety?

Suddenly, a dark shadow approached through the entrance's luminous barrier—undoubtedly his pursuer. Qin Chong immediately tensed, channeling all his energy into the Greenwater Sword. Unfortunately, the sword's water-aligned nature clashed with his fire-based cultivation, limiting its effectiveness. Yet with no other mid-grade spiritual tool available, it would have to suffice.

To his surprise, the man was blocked by the entrance barrier, now attacking it furiously. This unexpected development increased Qin Chong's odds of survival. He realized the Eight Trigrams Mirror must be what allowed his own unimpeded access.

After several failed attacks, the man suddenly stopped, apparently recognizing the barrier's strength exceeded his capabilities. Pressing against the barrier, he studied it intently—strangely, he seemed unable to see Qin Chong inside. The barrier functioned like a two-way mirror, an irony not lost on Qin Chong.

With the enemy exposed and himself hidden behind impenetrable defenses, Qin Chong recognized his advantage. A fierce killing intent arose—how could he waste such a heaven-sent opportunity?

"Hum!"

The Greenwater Sword seemed to resonate with his murderous will, vibrating powerfully as its aura surged. A green streak shot through the barrier, piercing the man's heart before he could react. Dying eyes stared uncomprehending at the barrier now stained red by spreading blood.

Alarm struck Qin Chong—last time, blood had attracted demonic beasts. He immediately dragged the corpse inside the chamber.

The frigid waters had already chilled the body. Removing the black face cloth revealed an unremarkable stranger. Searching the man's storage pouch for clues, Qin Chong was unprepared when a gray streak shot out, striking his forehead.

No pain came initially—then searing agony erupted in his sea of consciousness. The man's spirit had hidden in the storage pouch, now attempting possession!

Possession was a common last resort for dying cultivators, though governed by strict limitations: one couldn't possess mortals or higher-realm cultivators, and only one attempt was permitted in a lifetime. Success depended heavily on spiritual strength—Qi Condensation cultivators' weak spirits rarely survived long after bodily death. Experienced fighters would immediately destroy a foe's spirit, but Qin Chong's lack of combat experience and haste to claim the storage pouch had left him vulnerable.

Inside Qin Chong's consciousness, two gray figures battled desperately. Though Qin Chong's spirit—merged with the original host's—was stronger than most peers, it still fell short against this half-step Foundation Building cultivator's spirit. Chunks of his spiritual form were being torn away.

In desperation, Qin Chong remembered the Eight Trigrams Mirror. Clutching the invading spirit, he poured all his will into dragging it into the mirror's space.

Upon entering, the enemy spirit froze as if electrocuted, becoming completely inert. Qin Chong's spirit devoured it unopposed, eventually patting its swollen belly with satisfaction before returning to his sea of consciousness.
