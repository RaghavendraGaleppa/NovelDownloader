# Chapter 1: Eternal Night

That day, the sun set and never rose again...

Eternal Night. The world was plunged into darkness, like an unfathomable abyss intent on devouring everything. Daylight had long become a thing of the past, a mere legend.

Across the vast frozen plains, biting winds raged, and heavy snow fell, accumulating to half a person's height on the ground. Twin Trees Village was half-buried in the deep snow. With only forty or fifty households, it resembled a village forgotten by time, its clusters of houses merely vague silhouettes in the dark night. In the howling gales, many rooftops swayed precariously, as if on the verge of being ripped off.

Qin Ming was very weak. He woke up, his stomach rumbling incessantly from hunger. In the cold night, the mere thought of any food made him involuntarily swallow. Forget steaming meat dishes or fresh, succulent fruits; even imagining a piece of cold, hard flatbread made his mouth water and filled it with a sweet taste.

The weather was freezing, and both inside and outside the house were so dark it felt suffocating. Qin Ming pulled his tattered quilt tighter. The warmth from the *kang* (heated brick bed) couldn't ward off the biting cold outside; inhaling the frigid air felt like shards of ice scraping his lungs, a faint stinging sensation. He forced himself to stop thinking about food, lest acidic bile rise in his stomach and mouth.

As he calmed his emotions, he suddenly realized his mind was remarkably clear, no longer as foggy as before. Could his "peculiar sickness" finally be leaving him? Though plagued by hunger and cold, the long-term illness finally showed signs of turning, and a spark appeared in his eyes. He waited for "Shallow Night" to arrive.

As time passed, the howling wind gradually subsided, and the swirling, heavy snowflakes gave way to sporadic, smaller flakes. A commotion arose in the adjacent yard, and voices drifted over. It was a young couple, Lu Ze and Liang Wanqing.

"Where are you going? Are you bringing food to Qin Ming again?" Liang Wanqing's voice gradually rose.

"He's been very sick, only sixteen or seventeen, living all alone. It's quite pitiful," Lu Ze said softly.

"Don't you know we don't have much food left at home? If this continues, our two children will starve!" Liang Wanqing exclaimed, agitated.

"The blizzard has stopped; we'll find a way to manage," Lu Ze said, gazing at the pitch-black world outside.

Hearing the couple's argument, Qin Ming felt deeply apologetic. He didn't want to accept Lu Ze's kindness anymore; in these times, every household struggled.

He had already gotten up from the *kang*. Even after putting on his padded clothes, he still felt cold, so he found an old animal hide coat from the cupboard, wrapped himself in it, and paced back and forth, rubbing his hands together in the dark room. After his severe illness, his slender body had become somewhat gaunt. His long black hair, which reached his shoulders, had lost some of its luster, and his refined face was slightly pale. Yet, his clear eyes were remarkably bright and sharp. Though he bore the pallor of sickness, he exuded an aura of resilience.

A month ago, he had barely escaped from the mountains, his hands and feet already blackened. He had been severely ill ever since. As for his companions, they had died the very day they returned. Qin Ming was afflicted by the "peculiar sickness," and many believed he wouldn't survive. But he had endured until now, and was clearly recovering. The thought of the unknown dangers in the mountains still sent shivers down his spine.

The darkness outside began to change, as if ink had been dropped into a small amount of clear water and was slowly diluting. "Shallow Night" was arriving, which was their "daytime." Evidently, this was only slightly better than "Deep Night"; the world remained largely shrouded in night, and distant objects were indistinct.

The courtyard gate was pushed open. Lu Ze arrived, his sturdy body strong and capable. He used an iron shovel to clear the accumulated snow to either side, quickly creating a path to the house door. Qin Ming opened the house door, which had been sealed by the heavy snow, and called out, "Brother Lu."

Lu Ze carried a glowing cloth bag. He poured its contents into a stone basin in the snow, and a pile of crimson, radiant stones tumbled out, clattering crisply as their light pierced the darkness. These were "Sunstones," their very name carrying a beautiful hope for people in this era. They now illuminated the courtyard.

Lu Ze exclaimed in surprise, "Little Qin, you seem to be in much better spirits!"

Qin Ming invited him inside and truthfully explained his condition: he was no longer sluggish and believed he was truly recovering. Lu Ze remarked that Qin Ming had a strong life force, surviving the "peculiar sickness" from the mountains, which was truly remarkable. He poured the remaining glowing stones from the cloth bag into a copper basin inside the room, instantly filling the entire space with radiance. Sunstones were sourced from "Fire Springs." Though they glowed with a fiery radiance, their temperature was far lower than the human body. They would extinguish automatically after several hours and needed to be returned to the "Fire Spring" for re-nurturing.

"Here!" Lu Ze offered a food box.

Qin Ming had been gravely ill for a month, and his stored food had run out days ago. He had been relying entirely on Lu Ze's generosity. After hearing the couple's argument shortly before and realizing their own circumstances weren't much better, he felt a pang of guilt.

"Eat it while it's hot," Lu Ze urged. He was a practical man who knew how to repay kindness. Once, when he had been lost in the pitch-black, boundless dense forest, it was Qin Ming who had called his name over and over, guiding him back.

Gazing at the steaming black flatbread, the intense hunger made Qin Ming involuntarily want to swallow.

"Why are you just standing there? Your body isn't fully recovered yet; you can't get better if you starve. Don't be a stranger," Lu Ze said, placing the food box directly into his hands.

"Brother Lu!" In the end, Qin Ming didn't hesitate. He tore off a piece of the flatbread, feeling its rough texture, but he devoured it greedily, finding it incredibly sweet and fragrant in his mouth.

"Call me if you need anything," Lu Ze said, turning to leave.

As his hunger subsided, Qin Ming felt even more energetic. Various discomforts in his body were fading; he was certain his lingering illness would soon be gone. He thought about going outside for some fresh air and a walk. Pushing open the courtyard gate, he stepped onto the street. The weather was exceptionally cold, and white mist billowed from his mouth and nose with every breath.

In Shallow Night, which was "daytime" in this era, the fiery glow of Sunstones emanated from every house, casting a faint light onto the street.

"Qin Ming, are you alright now?" Someone noticed him.

"Little Qin, let me have a look." Old Granny Zhou from North Street pulled him closer, examining him from left to right, and saw that his complexion was much better than when she last saw him. Qin Ming smiled and greeted them, telling them his body was indeed recovering quickly.

There weren't many people at the intersection, and they all wore incredulous expressions. Could one really recover after being afflicted by the "peculiar sickness"?

"Little Qin, even if your body is getting better, don't rush outside. It's very dangerous out there now," Old Granny Zhou warned, looking towards the inky black world beyond the village. Other neighbors also looked troubled. The year was bad, and the lack of food was now a major problem; people would starve to death if this continued. Qin Ming noticed that Old Granny Zhou, who used to be kind and gentle, now had a bloodless face and a frail, thin body, as if a gust of wind could knock her over.

After the others left, Old Granny Zhou carefully took a few pieces of dried yams from her pocket and pressed them into Qin Ming's hand. Qin Ming quickly pushed them back. The old woman was so old, and she herself looked hungry. How could he possibly accept her daily sustenance?

Each household had cleared the area around their own doorstep, but not thoroughly. There was still accumulated snow, which crunched underfoot as Qin Ming exhaled white mist and walked forward. Nearing the edge of the village, he stopped.

In front of a larger courtyard, there was a small threshing ground. A black mountain goat, as tall as an adult's shoulder, was pulling a stone millstone, grinding silver-grained mutated wheat. Not everyone lacked food; clearly, the family at the edge of the village was quite well-off. Qin Ming stared at the black mountain goat, his eyes gleaming. With basic sustenance a problem, he naturally hadn't eaten meat in a very long time; he yearned for it immensely. The black mountain goat was quite large, with thick horns, appearing somewhat fierce. Sensing Qin Ming's gaze, it seemed startled, and its perked tail immediately drooped down.

"Little Qin, recovered now? Surviving a great disaster surely means future blessings." A stocky, bearded middle-aged man stood at the courtyard entrance, assuming Qin Ming was looking at the mutated grain under the millstone—silver wheat. He then added, "Our family is large, and consumption is too fast. This is also the last of our stored food."

"Uncle Yang is amazing, managing to take care of such a large family in these times," Qin Ming said with a laugh. Of course, he didn't believe the man only had one bag of silver wheat left.

After greeting Yang Yongqing, he continued towards the edge of the village. The "Fire Spring" was ahead, illuminating the vicinity brightly. Stones were piled up and enclosed there, forming a pool about eighteen feet square, with a stone wall no higher than knee-level. Inside glowed a fiery red light. In this blizzard season, although the Fire Spring inside was nearly depleted and no longer gurgled forth, it still emanated a lingering fiery glow. Within the pool were two trees, the origin of Twin Trees Village's name. One tree had jet-black leaves, the other snow-white, and neither withered in the harsh winter.
