# Chapter 15: The Golden Bell Artifact  

As dawn broke, Lin Shan found a deserted alley to change out of his assassin's gear. Emerging from the alley, he now appeared as a refined and handsome young nobleman in white robes.  

"Just a bit short on funds," he mused.  

Lin Shan currently had just over thirty taels of silver left. He realized that while food and drink weren't costly, greasing palms was expensive. If another situation like the one with Manager Jiang arose, he wouldn't be able to manage without at least a few dozen taels.  

But such expenses were necessary. Only by spending could he quickly integrate into the organization. As a newcomer to the martial world, he couldn't skimp on buying information—a peasant mindset would never get him far.  

Now that he had infiltrated the Nightingales, the matter of ancient resonance remained unresolved. He couldn't just force the assassins to hand over their tokens for inspection. Only Protector Jiang likely had that authority.  

Speaking of Protector Jiang, Lin Shan had initially assumed he was a peak Houtian expert for killing Chief Escort Wang. But according to Manager Jiang, he was actually a half-step Xiantian master!  

That was a powerful ally. If Lin Shan could win his favor, he might be able to manipulate the token situation.  

"I recall Protector Jiang was in need of a fine sword..."  

As Lin Shan strolled through the streets of Zangke City, he pondered his next steps.  

Vendors were already setting up their stalls, the aroma of steamed buns, soy milk, fried dough sticks, and tofu making his stomach growl. He exchanged some silver for coins and enjoyed a hearty breakfast.  

After wandering for another hour, the streets grew busier. Zangke, as a trade hub with foreign tribes, was far more bustling than Qinghe County. Bearded southern merchants in round hats were a common sight.  

At a corner ahead, he finally spotted an inn—a perfect place to gather information. His first priority was finding lodging, which meant dealing with a rental agent, locally known as a "toothman."  

With the innkeeper's help, Lin Shan found a rental agent and was shown a quiet courtyard in the northern part of the city. The owner was a reputable local merchant with multiple properties.  

Lin Shan spent ten taels to rent the place for two months, finally securing a safe haven.

For the next few days, Lin Shan spent his nights cultivating and his days exploring the city. After adjusting to his new surroundings, he sat on a stone bench in his courtyard, contemplating his next move.  

"The immediate goal is to find ancient resonance," he thought. "Whether it's enhancing pills to boost my cultivation or refining weapons for profit, it'll create a positive cycle." As for collecting tokens, that was beyond his current means.  

"Ah! I haven't checked the antique shops or the curio street in Zangke yet. Maybe I can find something valuable there!"  

With all his assets in hand, Lin Shan eagerly stepped into an antique shop in the western part of the city.  

---  

"Welcome, young master! Xiao Lan, serve tea!"  

As soon as Lin Shan entered, an elderly man introduced as Manager Huang greeted him warmly. At sixteen, Lin Shan was already a Houtian martial artist, his bearing confident and eyes sharp. Dressed in white with a jade-like complexion and a folding fan in hand, he looked every bit the young noble.  

Though Manager Huang didn't recognize him, he treated him with deference—after all, business was business.  

"Show me your most ancient treasures," Lin Shan said, fanning himself. He instinctively reached for his purse, intending to offer ten taels as a gesture, but hesitated. An antique dealer like Manager Huang likely had deep pockets and might scoff at such a paltry sum.  

Better not risk looking cheap, especially when funds were tight.  

Unaware of Lin Shan's thoughts, Manager Huang obliged, leading him around the shop and introducing various items. Lin Shan feigned interest while discreetly touching the antiques, hoping for a reaction from his enhancement panel.  

After a fruitless round, they sat for tea. Soon, attendants brought out three items—the shop's prized treasures.  

Manager Huang enthusiastically presented them: a luminous jade coral from the eastern seas (no resonance), a pair of 500-year-old imperial jade bowls (also nothing), and finally, a gleaming golden bell.  

"This golden bell was recently unearthed from an ancient Yelang tomb," Manager Huang explained. "Legend says Yelang's king was devout, with countless temples across the land. This bell might have..."  

Lin Shan tuned him out as his enhancement panel finally activated:  

**[Soul-Calming Bell]**  
Quality: Ordinary  
Description: Originally a Buddhist ritual artifact imbued with spiritual power, now reduced to a mundane object by external forces.  
Ancient Resonance: 8 points.  
Absorb?  

Lin Shan was stunned. This was the first time he'd encountered an item with both resonance and a detailed description. Previously, antiques only prompted absorption, while enhanceable items showed descriptions.  

Could some objects be both enhanceable and carry resonance?  

This bell, however, couldn't be enhanced. Its description stated it was once a Buddhist artifact, now stripped of power.  

"An artifact? For rituals?" Lin Shan's mind raced. Was this world far more complex than it seemed?  

"Young master? Young master?"  

Manager Huang, having talked himself hoarse, noticed Lin Shan staring blankly at the bell.  

"Ah! Please, continue!"  

"...I've finished. Were you not listening at all?"  

Lin Shan was torn. Eight points of resonance—more than he'd ever seen! Enough to enhance two Houtian items to Xiantian level, or even upgrade his Xiantian cultivation manual, the *Evergreen Art*.  

But as a prized treasure, the bell would be exorbitantly expensive.  

"How much for the bell?" he asked, bracing himself.  

Manager Huang smiled and held up three fingers.  

"Three thousand!"  

Lin Shan's hope flickered—maybe in this lifetime...  

"Gold!"  

Lin Shan: "Farewell!"
