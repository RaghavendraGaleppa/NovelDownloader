Chapter 153: An仇不隔夜，裙下避灾

Inside the study of the Yamen.

Cao Yun sat steadily at his desk, reviewing the county's case files. His personal guard asked, "Sir, who shall we start with?"

Cao Yun said indifferently, "Start with the Captain of the Militia. This man is very close to Lin Guolong and was personally promoted by him."

"I have just arrived in the county. I shall use him to establish my authority. From top to bottom, we will clear out the remnants of the Lin family."

Originally... after the Lin family's operations and Lin Guolong's departure, the position of County Magistrate of Qingning County should have been inherited by a descendant of the Lin family.

However, within the Qiongfu Prefecture, famous families were secretly vying for power. Although Qingning County was remote, it was still a piece of meat. The Cao family cut in, and after various maneuvers, the position of County Magistrate fell into the hands of the Cao family.

Cao Yun coming to serve as the County Magistrate was a mission. He was to completely take over Qingning County, control it, and completely eliminate the influence of the Lin family's forces.

"Sir, how will you do it?" the personal guard asked.

Cao Yun pondered, tapping his fingers lightly, his eyes filled with thought. "This young man is quite young and hasn't been in office long. His foundation in the county is unstable. If I were to charge him with corruption, what do you think?"

"I think it's excellent," the guard said.

Captain of the Militia's Office.

Li Xian felt refreshed all over, like enduring a scorching summer and finally meeting a heavy rain. Just now, the Madam summoned him, and their swords merged as one. The progress in the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword was significant, and all side effects subsided.

[Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword]
[Proficiency: 11690/12000 Great Completion]

Only half a step away from the Perfection realm.

The Madam's "Frost Moon Void Sword" had only reached "Perfection" in the first layer, far from reaching the pinnacle.

But she possessed the complete sword manual. Long ago, she had refined the sword art to the third layer. With her talent in the Dao of the Sword, she could have continued to practice. However, the deeper the practice, the greater the side effects, forcing her to stop.

Now... seeing Li Xian's remarkable talent and the progress of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword far exceeding her expectations, she gradually felt tempted and had the intention to pick up the sword art again.

One must know that a martial art, especially a superior one, is extremely difficult to cultivate. It not only depends on martial talent but also on compatibility with the art.

Some people have average talent but are naturally compatible with this martial art. Naturally, they progress rapidly without bottlenecks.

The Madam increasingly valued Li Xian. Upon careful thought, it was truly rare to encounter someone in the world who belonged to the [Perfect Physique] like herself and was compatible with the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword.

In just a few months, without any guidance, he actually reached Great Completion. Moreover, the momentum was good; it seemed he could aim for [Perfection] soon.

She was already considering teaching him the second layer.

"Captain of the Militia!"

A guard at the entrance cupped his hands and said, "Sir, someone was looking for you earlier."

"Who?" Li Xian stretched his limbs.

The guard was about to answer when he suddenly saw a sword wound on Li Xian's palm. He asked with concern, "Sir, are you injured?"

Li Xian treated people kindly, without putting on airs, yet不失威严. The guards sincerely admired him and wished to become like him.

Some time ago, Wang Wu, who was injured and had his arm broken, was not abandoned by the Captain of the Militia. Instead, he received preferential treatment and was personally taught martial arts.

The brothers were deeply moved in their hearts. Therefore, the entire Captain of the Militia's Office was very united.

Li Xian smiled and said, "It's nothing, a minor injury." He washed it with clean water and wrapped it in gauze. Every time their swords merged as one, the Madam would inevitably stab his palm.

Lately, she has been stabbing deeper.

"I originally thought I had figured out the Madam's thoughts, but now it seems I still need to ponder it carefully," Li Xian thought to himself. He asked, "By the way, who was looking for me?"

"It was a constable from the Yamen," the guard said. "He said the new County Magistrate has taken office today. He called for you to go greet him."

"Oh?" Li Xian asked, "I thought it would still be a few days?"

"I don't know the specifics," the guard said.

Li Xian pondered. Although he didn't want to curry favor with the powerful, since the new County Magistrate had arrived, he should show some attitude. It would be better to have fewer troubles and fewer enemies.

He immediately went to the Yamen.

Li Xian said, "Please announce that Li Xian requests an audience, specifically to apologize for the negligence today."

The Yamen guards had been replaced with new faces.

Times were chaotic, and the situation in remote counties was complex. Officials from prominent families必带随行护卫.

After taking office, the accompanying guards directly served as Yamen guards to ensure a quick takeover of the situation.

Li Xian, though his experience was shallow, knew this. He couldn't help but think: "Isn't this County Magistrate also a member of the Lin family? Why take such precautions?"

"You are Li Xian?" the Yamen guard said casually, "Oh, wait a moment." He turned and left to report to Cao Yun.

Shortly after, the guard returned and said, "You can go back now. The County Magistrate is resting. Not just anyone can disturb him."

His expression was very arrogant.

Li Xian saw the guard's dismissive attitude and sensed the hostility.

His eyes narrowed slightly, and a sharp light溢出. Although his dual pupils were not fully opened, a trace of pressure seemed to materialize.

The guard's hair stood on end, and he felt inexplicably panicked. "Captain of the Militia... Sir, the County Magistrate is indeed resting. You... please return."

Li Xian didn't bother with him and returned to the Captain of the Militia's Office. The inner courtyard was quiet. He sat alone, sorting through his gains.

Although there was the principle of "Heaven rewards diligence," picking up melons here and sesame seeds there might lead to wasted effort. He needed to reflect often and firm his resolve. Only then could he take solid steps and move forward.

He reviewed his martial arts characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, and his current situation. Having gone through it all in his mind, Li Xian's state of mind was stable, and he began to improve his cultivation.

Tempering his body.

"I bought some pills on my way back from the village earlier. Although they are all common pills, they are useful to me."

Li Xian practiced a lot but rarely soaked and nurtured himself. In terms of "eating," he tried his best to have the best, which required spending a lot of silver.

He opened a brocade box containing three pink "square pills." Li Xian put one in his mouth, and the pill's effect gradually took effect.

This pill was called "Nourishing Qi Pill." Its effect was to nourish internal Qi, with an average effect, but the price was extremely expensive. One box cost over twenty taels.

After taking three in succession, his internal Qi grew a little. The colorful clouds above his Qi Lake became more vivid.

Li Xian exhaled a long breath. He adjusted his spirit, practiced the sword art again, and strived to reach Perfection as soon as possible.

Time passed, and in the blink of an eye, several days had gone by. Li Xian was meticulous and noticed that the number of people coming to give gifts had decreased. The Captain of the Militia's Office was very quiet, as if a storm was brewing.

"All difficult problems can be solved with strength."

Li Xian focused his mind on practicing martial arts, his mind clear. He sent people to observe the movements of the Yamen and remained vigilant. However, he did not worry excessively, and his days were peaceful.

One morning.

Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the door, as if troops were surrounding the place. A dispute could be faintly heard.

"Li Xian, the eighth-rank Captain of the Militia of Qingning County, come out immediately!"

A deafening sound rang out.

Cao Yun stood with his hands behind his back, proudly standing in front of the hall. Beside him were neat guards, holding spears and wearing armor, ready for battle.

"County Magistrate, what do you mean by this!" The guards all came out, their hands on their sword hilts, standing ready, and shouted angrily.

"What do I mean?" Cao Yun said coldly, "Call your master out, and everything will be clear."

He said indifferently, "As for you lot, there is still a way back. Don't go down the wrong path. If you change your ways now, you can still live."

As soon as these words were spoken, the Captain of the Militia's Office was in an uproar. From the County Magistrate's words, was the Captain of the Militia about to lose his life?

Was he going to make a move against the Captain of the Militia?

The crowd suddenly parted to make way. A young man with a red mole on his forehead and a handsome appearance strode forward. The moment he appeared, all the guards fell silent.

Li Xian said, "County Magistrate Cao, may I ask what crime we have committed to warrant such a heavy military encirclement?"

He already knew the new County Magistrate was not from the Lin family of Qiongfu.

Cao Yun was taken aback when he first saw Li Xian. He had only heard his name before, with people boasting about how handsome, mighty, and capable he was. Cao Yun had disdained it, always thinking: "What见识 can these rural bumpkins have? In such a barren place, what true dragon could emerge? The true dragons in their eyes are just loaches in mine."

But seeing him now, it was a great surprise. Such a person was rare even in the prefecture city. He couldn't help but be greatly surprised. His气势 was momentarily broken, but in an instant, he recovered.

"Good, Captain of the Militia. You, you, with such a great future ahead, why don't you know your place?" Cao Yun said, "The current court is cracking down on corruption. I, Cao Yun, am now the County Magistrate of Qingning. Only after arriving in Qingning did I realize the hardships of the people here."

"There are thousands upon thousands of people who cannot eat their fill or clothe themselves. As officials, we should speak for the people. I will personally handle and strictly investigate corruption."

"Now it has come to your turn. If you are sensible, cooperate乖乖. I will show mercy considering your military merits."

Li Xian smiled and said, "You say I am corrupt?"

"It's not me saying it, but the people saying it, the people's hearts saying it, and the will of Heaven saying it." Cao Yun pointed to the yellow sky and the yellow earth, full of righteousness.

If it came to eloquence, Lin Guolong was far inferior to him.

"Everything requires evidence. Do you have evidence?" Li Xian said.

"Evidence naturally exists," Cao Yun said. "You come back with me. Tomorrow, we will hold a public trial. The people of Qingning County can all come and watch. Your crimes will be made public."

"Ridiculous," Li Xian said with utter disgust.

"You dare to resist arrest?" Cao Yun shouted. He stepped back several steps, and the guards around him protected him. The armored soldiers pointed their long spears at him.

In the distance, the archers drew their bows full, filled with killing intent.

"Why would I need to resist arrest?" Li Xian said calmly. "I have an official identity after all. Although you are one rank higher than me, when all is said and done, you have no right to convict me."

"On the contrary... you privately mobilized the county soldiers to encircle my Captain of the Militia's Office. That is what violates the court's discipline."

"Snake Walking Sect, Red Copper Sect, where are all the martial arts schools?"

Li Xian let out a great shout.

Countless sect disciples and martial arts school apprentices emerged from both sides of the street, surrounding the county soldiers.

The position of Captain of the Militia, if handled poorly, is powerless and difficult. If handled well, one does not fear the County Magistrate at all.

Li Xian had subdued all the martial forces. He had just sent someone to report and urgently summoned manpower to encircle and resist. Now, with a single command, the momentum was immense.

The sects and schools dared not disobey. If the County Magistrate truly had means and could gradually weaken Li Xian's forces, the sects and schools would be willing to push the boat with the current and secretly assist. But this fellow was foolish to confront him head-on. The sects and schools found it difficult to just stand by.

First, they feared Li Xian's revenge.

Second, the County Magistrate was tough in his methods and made a big move as soon as he arrived. If he took down Li Xian, it might be their turn next.

Third, no matter how overbearing Li Xian was, he was a native of Qingning County. The rules were already set. Although the sects and schools didn't eat as well as before, it was indeed more stable.

Li Xian serving as Captain of the Militia was not entirely a bad thing.

For these reasons, with Li Xian's single command, the three schools and two sects, large and small martial arts schools, and even some Qingning noble families responded one after another.

"You! You! You!"

"Rebellion, rebellion, you dare to rebel!"

Cao Yun was so angry his beard trembled. He had thought that Li Xian hadn't been in office long and had an unstable foundation, making him easy to manipulate. He didn't expect him to have reached such a scale.

Li Xian sneered, "County Magistrate Cao, if I truly wanted to rebel, you would already be dead!"

"I am the Captain of the Militia. If you want to arrest me, you need approval from above. Otherwise, I cannot comply."

Cao Yun saw the situation and knew that a hard fight was not advantageous. His expression was ugly, and he was greatly frustrated. After a stalemate for a moment, Cao Yun finally backed down and snorted, "Alright, you have guts. What I did today was not according to the rules!"

He led his men back to the Yamen.

As soon as he returned to the Yamen, he heard the sounds of smashing and cursing. Cao Yun cursed, "A bunch of bumpkins, not knowing how to die, daring to oppose my Cao family."

"Good, good... I will deal with that Li Xian first, and then deal with each of you one by one!"

"You want procedure, I will give you procedure."

"Let's see what excuses you have then!"

Cao Yun immediately wrote a letter and sent it to his family. The Cao family had people, several of whom were officials in the prefecture city, holding high positions. They even held a sliver of the fortune.

To deal with a Captain of the Militia was truly too easy.

Inside the Captain of the Militia's Office.

Li Xian's expression was calm as he wiped the Golden Leopard Bow. This morning, Cao Yun had surrounded the Captain of the Militia's Office without saying a word, determined to deal with him.

But he had miscalculated.

This matter was far from over.

Since that was the case, what else was there to say? This仇 will not wait until night; this official can be beheaded tonight!

As for the consequences...

If I can play the game, I will play it. If I cannot, I will pull in Madam Wen. If my strength is not enough, hiding under a skirt to avoid disaster is never shameful.
