# Chapter 185: The Grand Banquet Begins, Li Xian Astounds the Crowd!

Han Yue Residence.

Li Xian cleared his mind of distracting thoughts and refined his martial arts. The long sword in his hand danced, waves of scorching heat rolling forth, natural and unrestrained. The Sword of the Immortal Couple was a dual-wielding technique; practicing it alone, Li Xian lacked the meaning of "Yin and Yang," resulting in a flaw of "incompleteness."

However, this coincided perfectly with the "immortal" intent within the sword. The sword intent was ethereal, elegant, and otherworldly, moving with the grace of a soaring dragon.

\[Sword of Waning Sun and Fading Blood · First Layer\]
\[Proficiency: 26389/50000 (Perfected)\]

\[Sword of Waning Sun and Fading Blood · Second Layer\]
\[Proficiency: 3526/24000 (Great Mastery)\]

He consumed Essence Treasures daily, digesting the精华 of heaven and earth.

\[Consuming Essence\]
\[Proficiency: 54/100\]

The Essence Consumption had reached its Fifth Shedding. Li Xian's body was flawless. He wiped away the rouge on his brow, where the red mole flashed with a crimson light.

Dancing with a sword in the snow possessed a unique heroic charm. Despite enduring ridicule, Li Xian's heart remained as steady as a mountain. He paid it no mind, having already forgotten the matter.

"The heavens and earth are vast, and my sword is vast."

Li Xian suddenly felt an urge. Unbound by the framework of sword techniques, he danced freely, treating it as mere play. However, because the First Layer of the Sword of Waning Sun and Fading Blood was already [Perfected], even his wild dancing continued to accumulate proficiency.

"I wonder where the Madam has gone?"

Li Xian boiled water to brew tea, sitting in the courtyard to admire the snow. He returned to bed to rest late at night.

The next day.

Li Xiaofan had left the city the previous night. The two brothers met briefly before parting ways again. Li Xian originally intended to practice martial arts in peace, rising in the morning to train for an hour. The Sword of Waning Sun and Fading Blood and the Gang Thunder Finger had just reached Great Mastery, making it difficult to break through to the next realm in the short term. He then thought that he could practice martial arts any day, but opportunities in the Prefecture City were rare. So, he tidied himself up, changed out of his sweat-soaked clothes, and went out to wander and have fun.

Communication methods in the city's markets were mostly through letters and word of mouth.

Li Xian's reputation was notorious, with various rumors circulating. Yesterday, news spread that the Evil Lieutenant had entered the city and injured the prodigy Wan Run, his strength terrifying. This sparked another wave of heated discussion. However, when Li Xian actually walked past the crowd, no one recognized him.

The Prefecture City boasted three hundred and sixty tall buildings.

The city contained mountains, lakes, and rivers. Towers and mountains overlapped, lakes and rivers intersected. The morning mist was hazy, breathtakingly beautiful.

Martial arts schools, shops, and strange people, events, and objects were countless.

Passing by a "Red Dream Tower," the girls inside tossed down handkerchiefs, chirping like birds, laughing joyfully: "Good handsome man, come up and sit awhile!" "What a fine gentleman, we won't charge you money, just come up and sit awhile."

Li Xian went to a bookshop and bought a map of the Prefecture City and a few curious miscellaneous books. The "Zhang Hanbing" he bought last time was already finished, and he found it extremely interesting.

Qingning County was small with few books. The bookshops in the Prefecture City had a wide variety, though the prices were slightly higher.

In this way, he played around for several days, and the Layered Tower Banquet drew ever closer. Snowflakes floated in the heavens and earth, but the true first snow had yet to fall.

"The Layered Tower Banquet is approaching, yet the Madam still hasn't appeared. Is she expecting me to face it alone?"

Li Xian pondered. If not for the Madam's words, he would never have come to the Prefecture City. But upon arriving, the Madam had vanished. He thought again: "No... the Madam tests me constantly. Her absence might be another test?"

Since he was here, he would be at ease. He thought no more of it and remained calm. In the blink of an eye, it was the twenty-fourth of October, the world was frosty, and the Layered Tower Banquet was imminent.

The Layered Tower Banquet was held at the "Heavenly Man Tower," which stood in the center of a vast lake. The lake surface was broad, smooth as a mirror, and the water was clear.

However, this lake was named "Pool."

Every year, when the first snow fell, a great banquet was held here, inviting the prodigies of the Prefecture City.

The Heavenly Man Tower was entirely black, about seven stories high, with a very strange structure. Each floor hosted a grand banquet for the various prodigies to exchange martial arts insights.

It wasn't necessarily about fighting to the death to determine victory and defeat. But when young heroes gathered and beautiful women met, naturally, their blood boiled, and they were unwilling to suffer a loss to their reputation. Verbal discussions often turned into heated debates, and finally, actual combat was inevitable.

In front of the tower.

Within the Pool Lake.

The Prefecture City families: Cao, Chu, Lin, Yuwen... arrived early. The visitors were all clan elders; they stood on wooden boats, circling the tower. They came to the center of the lake and looked down into the depths. The green water was deep, ripples undulating.

Deep at the bottom of the lake, a tripod stood tall. Reflecting the sunlight, it was like a mirror during the day; only at night could those with exceptional eyesight, after staring for a long time, barely make out the object.

That tripod had sunk in the lake for many years, its body covered in moss. Crabs and shrimp nested in it, snakes and fish swam past.

Cao Shuang of the Cao clan's six elders said, "This formation is about to complete; that thing is about to emerge."

Lin Bei of the Lin clan's seventh elder said, "Originally, if it didn't appear this year, it would next year. But that Ouye Zi passed through this area and献上 the Sunken River Treasure Sword, which will inevitably accelerate the Layered Tower Banquet. I'm afraid it will definitely come out this year."

A middle-aged man from the Yuwen clan, named Yuwen Chang, said, "You say, although Ouye Zi is a master forger with a famous reputation, he shouldn't just give away a treasure sword randomly. Is his intention to take a share of the profit?"

Upon hearing this, everyone frowned. They fell silent, revealing displeased expressions.

After a while, Cao Shuang said, "Hmph, if that's the case, he is thinking too beautifully. This thing, at the very least, only appears once every fifteen years. Sometimes, when talent is scarce, it might not appear for thirty or forty years. He, on the other hand, just happened to pass by, took out a treasure weapon, and easily wants a share? How could there be such a good thing?"

The next day.

The first snow of heaven and earth fell, in the Pool Lake stood the black tower.

The major clans of the Prefecture City had already set up banquet tables and arranged seats within the tower beforehand.

The Heavenly Man Tower was about seven stories high, and the seating arrangement had its own rules. The seventh floor was the position of the leader, with only one seat. The dishes included: Mysterious Lotus Soup, Fish Leaping Over the Dragon Gate, and Gentleman of the Pool—three famous dishes of the Prefecture City.

The ingredients used in the dishes were all rare treasures, hard to find, with extraordinary effects and unparalleled taste. Even the upper echelons of the various clans found it difficult to enjoy such a feast.

The sixth floor was the position of the lord, with four seats, and the dishes were slightly inferior. The fifth floor was the position of the minister, with six seats, and the dishes were even worse... decreasing step by step. By the first floor, there were twenty-one seats, and the dishes were the worst. But even the worst was not something ordinary people could eat.

From top to bottom, there were a total of seventy-five seats.

Although it was a banquet, it was actually a hidden ranking list, designed to provoke conflict. Those in lower positions could challenge for seats. How to compete was simple: it was either "debating martial arts through words" or "fighting with fists and feet."

The Heavenly Man Tower was set in the middle of the Pool Lake.

The Pool Lake was vast, but the surface was calm. Every year's first snow was always without wind or waves. Therefore, whenever the prodigies in the tower debated martial arts, their voices carried to all sides of the lake. Passersby, various clans, and heads of martial arts schools... could all hear them.

Surrounding the Pool Lake were tall buildings. Guests in the private rooms had even better positions, able to directly see the scenes inside the banquet.

It was truly a grand event in the Prefecture City!

That morning.

The area around the Pool Lake was already crowded with pedestrians. On all four sides of the lake, tall buildings stood, and wealthy merchants and aristocratic families in the private rooms had already taken their seats early.

It was incredibly lively.

Gu Nianjun had no interest in this matter, but the number one on the Hero List, Zhou Shijie, was also a student of the Prefecture Academy and had gained fortune. He had invited Gu Nianjun warmly several days in advance to attend the Layered Tower Banquet. Gu Nianjun naturally refused frankly, but was pestered relentlessly. Plus, he really had nothing to do today, so he came as agreed.

At the 'Dragon Gate Tower' beside the Pool Lake.

Zhou Shijie was young and handsome, tall and broad-shouldered, dressed in luxurious brocade. He said, "Nianjun, I've reserved a private room for you at the Dragon Gate Tower. I'm so happy you could come."

Gu Nianjun got off the carriage and nodded slightly. Just as he was about to ascend the Dragon Gate Tower, he suddenly caught a glimpse of a figure. The originally indifferent expression instantly turned solemn.

Zhou Shijie stared intently and was immediately startled. On the carriage road, a white horse and black carriage stopped, and a woman in a white dress got down. Her grace was indescribable, her expression gentle. He stared blankly for a moment.

The woman glanced up, lingering on Gu Nianjun for a moment, before walking towards the Dragon Gate Tower. Her appearance and bearing were beyond words.

Gu Nianjun said solemnly, "Why is she here too?"

"Nianjun, you know her? Who is she?" Zhou Shijie asked.

"Let's go upstairs!" Gu Nianjun had suddenly become interested. He didn't answer Zhou Shijie, just muttered to himself, "If she has come, I hope this Layered Tower Banquet won't stir up any bloody storms."

"Nianjun, Nianjun!" Zhou Shijie hurriedly chased after him, secretly using his lightness skill. But no matter how he chased, he was always half a step behind.

Many spectators took their seats one after another.

Lin Aoshan, as the "Ancestral Grandmother of the Lin Clan," was restricted by her seniority in the clan and did not enter the Hero List. But she was quite interested in this Layered Tower Banquet, so she had also booked a private room in a building beside the Pool Lake.

"Everyone, sit," Lin Aoshan said with a smile.

In the private room, the many Lin clan elders with graying temples, haggard faces, and dim eyes sat down one after another.

Lin Aoshan stroked her chin, thinking of Li Xian's reputation in the Prefecture City. If he also came to the banquet, it would be extremely interesting. She glanced over; the area around the Pool Lake was already packed, the shore had no place to stand, and many people were squeezed into the lake, becoming drowned rats.

Suddenly, a loud laugh echoed everywhere.

Ouye Zi used his lightness skill, moving through the air with surprise. He actually jumped from the lakeshore and flew directly to the top of the 'Heavenly Man Tower,' standing on the roof tiles.

He had a square face with a thick beard, a rough appearance. The crowd was amazed, but he laughed heartily. Then, he pulled a long sword from his waist, tore off the cloth wrapping the blade, revealing a sharp sword body.

The treasure sword was three feet long, with edges on both sides, radiating a cold light.

Ouye Zi said, "This is the Sunken River Treasure Sword, forged from water essence black iron, peerlessly sharp. The sword has a strange power, please observe." He held the hilt and jumped into the lake. His feet actually touched the water without sinking.

He plunged the sword into the lake and gently stirred. With a "whoosh" sound, huge waves surged on the surface. He stood on the water, dancing his sword in the lake. The lake water actually followed his will, splashing freely.

He laughed heartily. Tapping the water with his toes, he jumped back to the top of the Heavenly Man Tower. He tapped the sword body, making a sharp sound. Splashes appeared on the lake surface.

This sword was mystical, truly opening everyone's eyes.

Ouye Zi continued, "This sword was forged in the cold river, using water from the river's heart. Thus, it has the [Manipulating Water] tendency."

"But I am not skilled in swordsmanship; a treasure gathering dust is truly a sin. Today, I shall gift this sword to the prodigies and heroes of the Prefecture City, so that it may be put to good use. To resolve a worry of mine."

He inserted the sword into the eaves. He leaped, his lightness skill breathtaking, stepping on air, crossing the Pool Lake, and landing on the roof of the "Dragon Gate Tower."

He sat on the roof, cross-legged, opened the gourd at his waist, and took a hearty drink, showing no intention of leaving.

Pedestrians and members of various clans... all looked over. The Cao, Lin, Chu, and Yuwen clans looked displeased but could do nothing, snorting coldly.

Gu Nianjun said, "Someone is coming."

The crowd became noisy again. A small boat drifted from the lake; the first prodigy of the Prefecture City had arrived for the banquet.

"It's the thirty-fourth on the Prodigy List, Luo Buer!" the crowd exclaimed.

Luo Buer wore a green robe, hands behind his back, incredibly carefree. The lake surface was calm, there was no wind around, yet he didn't need to row; he could make the boat move according to his will towards the Heavenly Man Tower.

"Luo Buer, lend me your boat."

The thirty-sixth on the Hero List, Li Ruhu, leaped, stepping on the water surface and speeding forward. This was a very high-level martial art; every time he touched the water, his body sank a bit. With this momentum, he would definitely sink into the lake by the time he reached the center. And for a martial artist at this level, once they fall into the water, surrounded by water, it would be difficult to use lightness skill again.

Seeing that he was about to make a fool of himself, he stepped onto Luo Buer's boat, immediately resolving the situation. In an instant, he had already surpassed Luo Buer. He had planned carefully for this scene of crossing the Pool Lake.

As expected, the crowd gasped in amazement, with repeated praise.

Luo Buer knew he had been used as a stepping stone, his face extremely unsightly, and he glared fiercely at Li Ruhu.

One could say that before the banquet even began, the various prodigies and talents had already shown their unique skills to cross the mirror lake. No one was willing to be outdone.

The Cao clan prodigy, Cao Xiu Xiu, had a beautiful appearance, charming as a flower, with bright eyes and white teeth. She stepped on a black water turtle and didn't need to use lightness skill to cross the mirror lake.

The little princess of the Chu clan, Chu Mei, used a martial art that was even more astonishing. She stepped directly onto the lake, and where her feet landed, frost formed. She walked calmly, her expression proud, every movement captivating hearts.

Ouye Zi looked on with curiosity, and after a moment, he understood how it was done. Although Chu Mei's move was astonishing, the secret lay entirely in her boots. These boots were the "Ice Silkworm Boots," freezing water upon contact. Plus, Chu Mei had practiced a powerful leg technique, which, combined with the boots, allowed her to step on water and leave ice.

But just that alone wasn't enough to walk leisurely on the lake surface. It also required matching high-level lightness skill. External objects and internal energy were both indispensable.

This scene was already wonderfully spectacular. The famous beauty in the city, Ji Hongyan, laughed lightly and then attended the banquet. She stepped on auspicious clouds and flew straight across.

One mountain is higher than another. Others shouted that a fairy had descended. Those lower on the Hero List couldn't see the key points and turned pale, admitting defeat.

Lin Aoshan said, "This girl's lightness skill may not be great, but her projectile skill must be extremely powerful!"

It turned out that Ji Hongyan had shot two flying shuttles beforehand, nailing them into the Heavenly Man Tower. The shuttles were tied with silkworm threads, which were hard for others to see. She used her lightness skill, aided by the silkworm threads, to create the effect of flying. The auspicious clouds under her feet were a manifestation of her lightness skill.

If her martial arts advanced further, the auspicious clouds might become substantial, and she might truly be able to walk on clouds.

Zhou Shijie saw that the momentum had been built, so he descended from the Dragon Gate Tower and began to attend the banquet. As the number one on the Hero List, he had to overshadow everyone, otherwise, the prodigies below would seize seats.

Hands behind his back, he walked to the shore and stomped hard. The lake water surged into a great wave, moving with fierce momentum. He leaped, stepping on the crest of the wave, hands behind his back, his demeanor elegant.

He was carried to the front of the tower by the wave.

This display was extraordinary. The stomp just now, stirring up a great wave in the lake, was a technique of the "Treading Waves Skill." He executed it so casually, having at least reached Great Mastery, or even Perfection. Stepping on the wave crest and riding the momentum revealed exceptional lightness skill.

And there was a deeper intention: you all showed your unique skills, but I am the true master of the waves.

The many experts present, including Lin, Cao, Chu, and Ouye Zi, all nodded secretly.

Zhou Shijie was proud and satisfied. After landing, he flicked his sleeves and put his hands behind his back. The various prodigies all looked at him, taking him as their leader. The spectators focused on him, treating him as the leader. While secretly pleased, he said decisively, "Since everyone is here, let us begin!"

"No, one person is still missing," Li Ruhu had been paying attention to the number of people.

Zhou Shijie frowned: "Who is missing?"

Everyone looked at each other in silence, names flashing through their minds, one name on the tip of their tongues: the Evil Lieutenant, Li Xian!

Just then, a leaf-like light boat entered the lake.

Li Xian stepped on the light boat, neither deliberately showing off his skills nor intentionally displaying his might. He drifted across the lake, his thoughts wandering.

The Madam's whereabouts were unpredictable. Li Xian had waited for a long time, and seeing she hadn't returned, he attended the gathering alone. The forces in this Prefecture City were numerous; it was truly a "dragon's pool or a tiger's den."

"Since I have come, I will be at ease. Even if it is a dragon's pool or a tiger's den, I, Li Xian, have arrived!"

Li Xian thought magnanimously, standing proudly on the boat.

When he first entered the lake, no one noticed him. By the time he had sailed halfway, the prodigies in the Heavenly Man Tower, the spectators in the Dragon Gate Tower, and the pedestrians on the lakeshore... finally noticed him.

Rumors said Li Xian had a strange and ugly face. Now, appearing before the crowd, he did have a strange feature—a red mole on his forehead.

But he was exceptionally handsome, with an otherworldly aura.

"This is... the Evil Lieutenant Li Xian?"

Similar exclamations came from inside the Heavenly Man Tower, the Dragon Gate Tower, and the lakeshore.
