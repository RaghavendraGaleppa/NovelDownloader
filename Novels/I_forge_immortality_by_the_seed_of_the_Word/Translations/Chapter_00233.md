# Chapter 231: Plot of the Immortal City

At the foot of Mount Lingshu, more than half a day had passed since Zhang Jing entered. Yet, no one had left. In fact, the cultivators who gathered upon hearing the news were increasing, especially those from Sanyuan City, the closest city, who rushed towards Mount Lingshu as if driven mad.

For no other reason than this: the news that the spiritual land of Mount Lingshu had been chosen as a Daoist site by a True Disciple of the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect had spread with astonishing speed.

On the periphery, an old cultivator with a white beard, who had just arrived, didn't even pause to rest. He gasped for breath, looked curiously at the beautiful middle-aged woman who had called him, and asked nervously yet excitedly, "What's going on? Why did a legendary True Disciple of the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect suddenly appear and want to make Mount Lingshu their Daoist site?"

Hearing this, a strange expression flashed across the middle-aged woman's face, and she slowly replied, "Well... actually, that esteemed senior didn't just 'suddenly appear.' You should have heard of them before."

"I have?" The old cultivator's voice carried a hint of confusion.

"Yes, it's Young Master Yu!"

"It's him?!" Gulp— A sound of swallowing suddenly echoed.

"It's like this..." The middle-aged woman smiled faintly, then recounted in detail how the contest for the spiritual land had repeatedly seen reversals that day. The old cultivator listened, dumbfounded. How could he have imagined that what seemed like a done deal before could have so many variables? Truly, everyone had their trump cards, and as soon as one performed, another took the stage.

As if thinking of something, a look of schadenfreude appeared on the old cultivator's face. "That True Disciple of the Dao Sect arrived in Sanyuan City several years ago. This means they must have set their eyes on Mount Lingshu's spiritual land a long time ago. I wonder what the Sanyuan City Lord's Mansion, the Yu River Sect, and the Longxiao Sword Sect are feeling right now."

"Then their grand display today, isn't it just a joke?"

"Alright, let's not concern ourselves with that," the middle-aged woman interrupted the old cultivator. Then, a strong anticipation flashed in her eyes. "Legend has it that these eminent figures of the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect, when establishing a Daoist site, will open their gates once to lecture on various Grand Dao principles. There are many examples of rogue cultivators achieving sudden enlightenment and rapid cultivation advancements from this. I wonder if this True Disciple will also open their gates for a lecture."

"If so, that would be an unprecedented heaven-sent opportunity for us."

"Sigh, I hope so." The old cultivator put away his smile and looked intently at the three Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits guarding the mountain gate in the distance.

Not far from them, a young man excitedly looked at the black-robed male cultivator beside him, his eyes filled with hope that seemed almost tangible. "Dao Brother, you seemed to have some connection with that esteemed senior back then. I wonder if we could follow—"

Hearing these words, the black-robed male cultivator immediately raised his head, revealing a simple, honest face on which a hint of a bitter smile appeared. "Daoist friend, you jest. How could that esteemed senior be someone we could rely on?" He shook his head. As for himself and those like him, the man had a clear understanding of his own limitations. A mere rogue cultivator, who had wasted nearly a thousand years and was still just an ordinary Golden Core Realm cultivator, how could he possibly catch the eye of such a figure? The other party was a legendary True Disciple of the Dao Sect. Even within the Dao Sect, which was filled with countless prodigies, they were undoubtedly a major figure. With a single decree, what kind of person couldn't be found?

Just then, Bang! Bang! The ground suddenly began to tremble. That was—

Tens of thousands of gazes turned towards the source of the commotion. In everyone's view, a massive, sky-obscuring divine giant figure slowly emerged from the depths of Mount Lingshu, each step covering hundreds of zhang. Merely by walking, it stirred up gusts of fierce wind. The giant god, with a hundred arms, adopted a sky-supporting posture, holding up an incredibly magnificent mountain gate. A hundred divine eyes opened and closed, revealing streaks of deep, dark light, utterly terrifying.

"What is that?!" Someone cried out in alarm.

"That's the Mighty Heavenly Artisan Ghost God from the Dao Sect's Ten Directions Underworld Secret Realm, a powerful existence that, legend says, only True Disciples can command!" At the foot of Mount Lingshu, witnessing this exaggerated scene, Huang Jiulong couldn't help but murmur. This is what a True Disciple is! Although nominally still a 'disciple', in reality, they had clearly ascended to the upper echelons of the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect, possessing resources and authority so terrifying that ordinary disciples like them couldn't even dream of it.

"Senior Brother, what is this Mighty Heavenly Artisan Ghost God?" Beside him, the other disciples from the Dao Sect's Yellow Sand Grotto-Heaven who heard Huang Jiulong's voice turned and asked cautiously. Their eyes were filled with shock. Seeing this terrifying thousand-zhang-tall ghost god holding up the mountain gate, they naturally understood that it was merely a creature summoned by the True Disciple, who had just entered Mount Lingshu, to construct the Daoist site.

Thinking of this, Hah— The three of them unconsciously let out a turbid breath. Only now did they finally gain a clearer understanding of the weight behind the words 'Dao Sect True Disciple'.

And in front of the three of them, Huang Jiulong did not answer. Instead, his gaze sharpened, looking directly at the figure radiating ethereal blue immortal light that suddenly appeared behind the Mighty Heavenly Artisan Ghost God. The next moment, the figure seemed to sense something and looked directly into his eyes. Boom! A loud bang suddenly echoed in his mind. Huang Jiulong felt as if all the scenery before his eyes vanished, leaving only two eyes, seemingly forged from ten thousand years of cold ice, emitting a terrifyingly cold and desolate gaze.

He didn't know how much time had passed. All the anomalies disappeared. Huang Jiulong's muddled consciousness also gradually returned to clarity. "Dao Integration Realm! That Senior Brother actually has a Dao Integration Realm immortal spirit under his command?" A hint of imperceptible shock flashed across his face.

"Everyone!" A grand voice suddenly interrupted Huang Jiulong's thoughts, simultaneously drawing the gazes of tens of thousands of cultivators present. "In accordance with custom, my Master will greatly open the Daoist site three months from now to expound upon various profound immortal Daos. At that time, all fated individuals may come to listen! As for now, you all should disperse." As the voice fell, Boom— The many cultivators at the foot of the mountain instantly erupted in excitement.

Time passed slowly. Hansheng's gaze fell upon the three individuals still lingering at the foot of Mount Lingshu. With a single wave of his hand, their three figures were instantly drawn before him. "Why are the three of you still here?"

"Reporting... Reporting, True Immortal, we... we three are the sect masters of the nearby Sanyuan City, Yu River Sect, and Longxiao Sword Sect. We wish to pay our respects to the esteemed True Disciple of the Dao Sect. May we request an announcement?" Feeling the terrifying aura emanating from the immortal spirit before them, an aura clearly surpassing the Dharma Idol Realm, the Sanyuan City Lord suppressed his fear, trembled as he stepped forward, bowed, and then respectfully spoke. His voice uncontrollably quivered.

Before long, three streaks of light swiftly flew out from Mount Lingshu. It wasn't until they were several thousand li away from Mount Lingshu that they slowly descended, transforming into three figures: two men and one woman.

"What did that esteemed senior mean earlier about our three parties jointly building a huge Immortal City nearby?" the gentle woman frowned, her words full of incomprehension. "And the bigger, the better, with as many residents as possible."

Hearing this, the long-browed man said casually, "Why bother thinking so much? Anyway, according to the esteemed senior, once Lingshu Immortal City is built, it will receive the protection of Mount Lingshu's Daoist site. In this way, this Immortal City will naturally become the absolute center within several million li, attracting countless resources and geniuses."

"And what immense advantages will our three forces have as the builders of Lingshu Immortal City?"

"Indeed!" The Sanyuan City Lord nodded in agreement, a flash of excitement in his eyes. "This is a heaven-sent opportunity for us!" However, immediately after, he seemed to realize something and said with some worry, "It's just that whether our three forces alone can seize this opportunity is a big problem. We must find a way to involve more forces to be safe."

"Otherwise, if the Immortal City is not built well and draws the esteemed senior's displeasure, this opportunity will instantly turn into a disaster!"

"After all, the wrath of a Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect True Disciple—" The Sanyuan City Lord hesitated, leaving his words unspoken.

Hearing this, the gentle woman and the long-browed man took a deep breath, and a solemn expression simultaneously flashed across their faces.
