# Chapter 74: The Astonishing Revelation of Dao Foundation

"Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven?"

Zhang Jing subconsciously repeated the name, then looked at Senior Brother Li with a blank expression. He was certain he had never heard this term before—neither in the initial "Three-Five Seeking Immortals Records" nor in the two jade slips about Luodu and the Dao Academy that Senior Sister Tong Yao had given him after joining Luodu Squad.

"Indeed, the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven," Senior Brother Li confirmed with a nod, producing a cyan jade slip in his hand. He released it, allowing the slip to float gently before Zhang Jing. 

"Junior Brother, this contains information about the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven. Some records come from our Luodu Squad predecessors, while others I gathered from senior brothers in the Inner Court. Read it carefully, but don't share its contents afterward," Senior Brother Li said with unusual gravity, as if the jade slip contained earth-shattering secrets.

"Understood," Zhang Jing replied solemnly, his expression turning serious as he carefully took the jade slip and extended his spiritual sense into it.

Instantly, fragmented pieces of information flooded his mind—disjointed and chaotic. It seemed even someone of Senior Brother Li's status had limited knowledge about this 'Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven.' A flicker of doubt crossed Zhang Jing's eyes before his attention was wholly captured by the jade slip's contents.

The Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven was said to be a gift from the 'Upper Realm,' currently jointly managed by three Dao Academies including Dragon Lake Dao Academy. Due to certain restrictions, it only opened once every few hundred years. Within it grew various miraculous resources, but more importantly, it contained immortal Dao principles left by celestial beings. Gaining even a sliver of comprehension could significantly enhance one's Dao Foundation quality, even triggering its evolution.

"Dao Foundation?" Zhang Jing lowered the jade slip and looked questioningly at Senior Brother Li.

"That pertains to the Foundation Establishment realm. Rumor has it the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven is actually opened for Inner Court senior brothers, but for Qi Refinement tenth-level cultivators on the verge of establishing their Dao Foundation, it's an extraordinary opportunity. Gaining enlightenment there almost guarantees the formation of a superior-grade Dao Foundation," Senior Brother Li patiently explained.

"What constitutes a superior-grade Dao Foundation?" Zhang Jing asked curiously.

"Ha! Junior Brother, all I can tell you now is that even among Inner Court Foundation Establishment senior brothers, there are vast differences in strength—all stemming from the quality of their initial Dao Foundation. As for more details, it's better to wait until you reach Qi Refinement tenth level. Knowing too much now won't benefit you," Senior Brother Li advised earnestly.

"I understand. Senior Brother summoned me here today, presumably concerning this Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven?" Zhang Jing ventured, a suspicion forming in his mind. There must be a reason for this sudden revelation.

A smile appeared on Senior Brother Li's face as he said solemnly, "Junior Brother, the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven will open in seventeen months. Besides numerous Inner Court senior brothers, Qi Refinement tenth-level cultivators under forty years old may also enter. Recently, the Coiling Dragon and Misty Dawn Squads received instructions from their supporting Inner Court senior brothers to fully nurture their newly recruited Junior Brothers Chen Xiandao and Shen Qingqing, helping them reach Qi Refinement tenth level before the opening. Do you grasp the implications?"

The moment these words were spoken, Zhang Jing understood. The top two squads and their supporting Inner Court senior brothers aimed to have Chen Xiandao and Shen Qingqing seize this opportunity to enter the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven!

Reaching Qi Refinement tenth level from the initial stage in just a year and a half was undeniably ambitious. Yet considering the Minor Void Heaven's connection to 'Dao Foundation quality' and its rare openings every few centuries, Zhang Jing could comprehend their reasoning.

Wait—did that mean Senior Brother Li was considering...

Seeing Zhang Jing's astonished expression, Senior Brother Li chuckled and explained, "No need for surprise, Junior Brother. Based on past experience, even without concentrated resources, top-tier geniuses only need three to five years to reach Qi Refinement tenth level and pass the examination to enter the Inner Court. That's why those two squads and their supporters made such plans."

"Originally, I had no such intentions," Senior Brother Li continued, "but your recent demonstrated cultivation speed has given me the idea to compete with them. Junior Brother, tell me truthfully—do you have the confidence?"

Under Senior Brother Li's intense gaze, Zhang Jing took a deep breath and answered firmly without hesitation: "This junior will absolutely live up to Senior Brother's expectations!"

He understood perfectly—Senior Brother Li's gamble on him couldn't be as simple as mere competition between Luodu Squad and the other two. But what did that matter? With nearly a year and a half to reach Qi Refinement tenth level, it wasn't impossible. Moreover, Senior Brother Li implied Luodu Squad would provide cultivation resources to assist him.

Previously unaware, now that he knew about the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven's significance for his future Dao path, Zhang Jing was determined not to miss this opportunity.

"Excellent! I knew I wasn't mistaken about you," Senior Brother Li nodded in satisfaction, his tone brooking no argument. "From now on, focus solely on cultivation. Don't worry about academy missions—I'll handle those arrangements."

"Many thanks, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said gratefully, awaiting further instructions.

"As for cultivation resources..." Senior Brother Li fell silent momentarily, as if making a difficult decision. "Though I'm the squad leader, there are many Inner Court senior brothers above me, and this is ultimately my personal initiative..."

After a pause, he looked up at Zhang Jing: "Here's what we'll do—starting now, you may collect three bottles (thirty pills total) of high-grade Water Origin Pills from me each month. Of course, once you reach late-stage Qi Refinement, if the Water Origin Pills prove insufficient, I'll make adjustments. Should you encounter any cultivation difficulties, you may raise them when collecting your monthly pills—I'll share all I know."

Zhang Jing couldn't hide his surprise. He'd been wondering about the extent of support the squad leader would provide, never expecting a daily Water Origin Pill. The total cost in Dao merits must be staggering!

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"

"Ha! The best thanks would be diligent cultivation upon your return. Remember—not a moment's slackness!"

"This junior will follow Senior Brother's instructions faithfully," Zhang Jing pledged seriously.

Exiting Luodu Tower, Zhang Jing glanced at the deepening twilight. Though he'd originally planned to visit the resource repository, he had no choice but to return to his cave abode—the repository would certainly be closed by now.

Back in his abode, light footsteps silenced the thunderous snoring. Deer Thirty-Eight poked its head out from the spirit beast chamber, eyes full of hope: "Master, did you buy my life-preserving ring?"

Zhang Jing nearly laughed aloud—a demonic beast constantly begging for a spirit beast ring was certainly unique.

"Too busy today. Another time."

"Oh... alright then," Deer Thirty-Eight withdrew its head dejectedly, then couldn't resist adding in a small voice: "Just don't forget, Master!"

"I won't forget," Zhang Jing replied with amused exasperation.
