## Chapter 62: Grade 2 Alchemist

Spiritless demonic beasts are generally difficult to contend with humans of the same cultivation level. This is because humans possess far too many methods to deal with them.

For example, currently, Lu Xu alone had trapped seven Scaled Apes using a single formation. If he were to face them head-on, he would be utterly incapable of simultaneously fighting so many opponents.

And facing the three Scaled Apes charging directly at him, Lu Xu could easily deal with them using various methods unique to humans.

An advanced-grade Rank 1 Earth Prison Talisman was activated, and suddenly several tall walls rose from the ground, forming an inverted bowl-shaped earth prison. This sudden appearance of the earth prison directly trapped the advanced-grade Rank 1 Scaled Ape within.

Afterward, Lu Xu immediately manipulated the Golden Light Mirror to unleash two consecutive golden lights, knocking the two mid-grade Rank 1 Scaled Apes flying backward. Two Wind Blade Talismans flew out, transforming into massive azure wind blades that swept across, severing the legs of these two Scaled Apes. The Golden Light Mirror then shot out golden light again, instantly piercing through the brows of the two Scaled Apes. Their blood-red eyes stared blankly as they collapsed with a crash.

"Bang!"

At this moment, the earth prison was also broken by the advanced-grade Rank 1 Scaled Ape. It roared and charged forward maniacally. But immediately, over a dozen vines suddenly grew from the ground, wrapping around its ankles. Following this, a chill permeated the air, causing frost to form on the ground, and the Scaled Ape's movements slowed down considerably.

It let out an unwilling roar, and streaks of dark light shot from its eyes. As the dark light approached, Lu Xu's expression remained calm, unmoving. A verdant wooden shield flew out, enlarging to block in front of him. Then, the Golden Light Mirror flew up again, shooting out golden lights, continuously striking the Scaled Ape. The golden lights specifically targeted areas not covered by scales. One blood hole after another appeared, and before long, the Scaled Ape roared one last time before falling.

"I need a sharper magical artifact!" Lu Xu thought to himself as he watched this scene. Relying solely on the Golden Light Mirror to attack this type of thick-skinned, robust demonic beast seemed somewhat insufficient now. And the Azure Glow Sword, as a mid-grade magical artifact, had long since become obsolete.

Lu Xu turned to check the situation within the formation; the five mid-grade Rank 1 Scaled Apes were already dead. The remaining two advanced-grade Rank 1 Scaled Apes also had various injuries. They relentlessly charged the formation, appearing frenzied. Lu Xu quickly maneuvered the Golden Light Mirror into the formation, joining the attack against these two Scaled Apes. After expending a large amount of spiritual power, the two Scaled Apes finally fell.

"Even with the assistance of a formation, dealing with so many demonic beasts alone is quite strenuous!" Lu Xu couldn't help but sigh as he looked at the ground strewn with corpses.

He had read some novels in his previous life, where the protagonists would slaughter demonic beasts of the same level as if they were chopping melons and cutting vegetables. Even demonic beasts a level higher than the protagonist could be instantly killed with ease. Once they entered a mountain range, the protagonist could kill from one end to the other, unstoppable. It was very satisfying to read at the time.

But when he truly faced demonic beasts, he realized that although these creatures were not highly intelligent, they were not that easy to deal with. Without this formation, if just two advanced-grade Rank 1 Scaled Apes simultaneously unleashed that dark light, Lu Xu's Verdant Wood Shield wouldn't hold up. Even if he could use defensive talismans to hold on for a while, he couldn't sustain it for too long. By then, being able to escape from these creatures would be considered good fortune.

"It seems that the path of using formations to deal with demonic beasts was not wrong. As long as the demonic beasts are lured into the formation, even if there are two or three advanced-grade Rank 1 demonic beasts, they won't be able to break through this formation in a short time!"

"Once they enter the formation, they will be at my mercy."

"Then, if I create a Grade 2 formation in the future, trapping Grade 2 demonic beasts shouldn't be a problem!"

"But the key is how to lure Grade 2 demonic beasts into the formation. Although they are not highly intelligent, they are fast."

"To set up a formation without them noticing, I must be far enough from their territory. But if the distance is too great, I won't be able to lure them into the formation without being caught!"

Lu Xu frowned deeply. A moment later, he suddenly felt relieved: "Forget it, why worry about this now? It's still too early to deal with Grade 2 demonic beasts!"

Looking at the ten Scaled Ape corpses on the ground, Lu Xu immediately got busy. The flesh and internal organs of Scaled Apes have very low value; humans cannot eat them, and they can only be used to feed spirit beasts. Lu Xu didn't have enough space to store these things, so he discarded them all. Their most valuable parts were the scales and the two eyeballs. Scales are materials for crafting defensive magical artifacts and can be sold for a high price. The eyeballs, on the other hand, are materials for refining offensive magical artifacts.

Lu Xu dug out the Scaled Ape eyeballs and stripped off all the scales from their bodies. The materials from ten Scaled Apes piled together, immediately occupying most of his storage bag.

"I need to get a bigger storage bag!"

Lu Xu put away his formation-setting materials and then flew towards the mountain peak. In front of a dark cave in the mountain peak, Lu Xu smelled a strong, pungent odor, mixed with a rich spiritual energy. There was a Rank 1 spiritual vein here, and the Moon Orchids thrived by absorbing the spiritual energy emitted from this vein.

Lu Xu entered the cave and carefully examined it. In a stone chamber at the top, which had a large opening allowing sight of the sky, he discovered a patch of pure white flowers. Moon Orchids! After picking a few sufficiently aged plants and placing them in a jade box, Lu Xu immediately turned back towards Myriad Immortals City. Moon Orchids could only be preserved for three days; he had to hurry.

The next day, in that alchemist's shop.

"Fellow Daoist Li, you came to see me so quickly, could it be..." The middle-aged man's eyes showed surprise when he saw Lu Xu approaching, then a look of joy appeared on his face as if he had realized something.

"Indeed, I have brought the Moon Orchid. Please inspect it, Fellow Daoist!" Lu Xu said, taking out a jade box and placing it in front of the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man opened it, and his face immediately lit up with pleasant surprise: "Excellent, excellent, indeed it is the Moon Orchid, and its age is sufficient. I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Li to be so fast."

"So, what's next...?" Lu Xu smiled.

The middle-aged man stood up and immediately said, "Please, Fellow Daoist Li, follow me to the inner city to pay respects to my master. I believe my master will grant Fellow Daoist's request!"

"Alright!" Lu Xu nodded decisively and followed the middle-aged man out of the tea house.

Led by the middle-aged man, Lu Xu passed through the city gate without hindrance and entered the inner city. As soon as he arrived, he immediately felt that the spiritual energy concentration here was many times stronger than outside. Even in the outermost areas of the inner city, the spiritual energy concentration was equivalent to a low-grade Rank 2 spiritual vein. In this area, the number of people significantly decreased.

"Fellow Daoist Li, please follow me!" The middle-aged man led Lu Xu to a small courtyard. After skillfully opening the courtyard gate, the two entered.

Before long, a white-haired old man appeared before Lu Xu. This was a Foundation Establishment cultivator! And also a revered Alchemist of Grade 2 at the Merchant Alliance's Hundred Herbs Pavilion.

"This old man is Liu Qingyuan. My disciple told me that Fellow Daoist is also an alchemist?" The white-haired old man looked Lu Xu up and down when he saw him, then asked.

"That's right, junior has achieved a little in the field of alchemy, but recently I've been stuck at a bottleneck, so I wish to ask for senior's guidance!" Lu Xu quickly bowed and said. A trace of apprehension lingered in his heart; after all, this was his first time being so close to a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

The white-haired old man waved his hand upon hearing this: "No need to be so polite!"

"Since you helped this old man find the Moon Orchid, I shall naturally grant you one request. I can personally guide you for one hour. After one hour, if you still haven't comprehended anything, you cannot blame this old man!"

"Everything according to senior's wishes!" Lu Xu said, handing over the box containing the Moon Orchid, while silently muttering in his heart as he looked at the old man:

"Check Alchemy experience!"
