# Chapter 112: Journey to the East Sea  

Nine months later, at the outer entrance of Yichuan Market, over a hundred cultivators had gathered.  

Among them, apart from a young man in white robes, all the others were women—plump or slender, enchantingly curvaceous. Though their appearances varied, most were quite attractive.  

"Truly worthy of being Yichuan's only brothel. The quality is indeed top-notch!"  

The young man in white was none other than Lin Shan, who had come to fulfill the two-year agreement. He had now stabilized his cultivation at the early Foundation Establishment stage, with his spiritual energy fully converted into wind and thunder attributes. However, the wind energy slightly dominated the vortex in his dantian, with only occasional crackling arcs of lightning flickering within the cyan spiritual energy.  

Before leaving, he had resigned from his position under Left True Person. He was genuinely grateful to his former employer, who had treated him well. Left True Person had expressed regret—after all, skilled workers like Lin Shan were hard to come by in the auction house. But everyone had their own aspirations, and no one could force the matter.  

As Lin Shan stood among the crowd, he couldn't help but marvel at the scene around him. The brothel cultivators were bold and fiery, casting flirtatious glances his way. Fortunately, now that he was at the Foundation Establishment stage, the Qi Condensation female cultivators didn’t dare to be too forward.  

Just then, the mist formation around Yichuan parted, and the proprietress of the Spring Swallow Pavilion emerged, accompanied by four women.  

To Lin Shan’s surprise, all four were Foundation Establishment cultivators. He had no idea when the proprietress had secretly trained them in Yichuan. Among them was none other than Luan Chun, the girl who had entertained him during his first visit to the brothel!  

This little girl had been at the Qi Condensation stage two years ago, yet now she had reached Foundation Establishment just like him! Had she been hiding her cultivation all along? Damn, this little enchantress was quite the actress.  

"Greetings, Protector Yan!"  

The female cultivators all bowed gracefully as the proprietress appeared. Lin Shan overheard from those nearby that Protector Yan’s real name was Yan Yuanchun, a Golden Core protector of the Black Lotus Sect, a demonic path faction.  

"Two years apart, and you’ve reached Foundation Establishment too?"  

The beautiful, black-clad proprietress of Spring Swallow Pavilion glided through the crowd and stopped before Lin Shan. Seeing his youthful appearance, she couldn’t resist pinching his handsome cheeks, giggling mischievously.  

Lin Shan could only stand there awkwardly. After all, she was a Golden Core elder, and he didn’t dare resist. Besides, he would be relying on her for this journey to the Black Lotus Sect. If she wanted to tease him a little, so be it.  

*I’ll endure it!*  

"What’s wrong, little guy? Don’t you remember the incident at Turtle Fishing Island in the East Sea?"  

Protector Yan’s teasing smile jolted Lin Shan’s memory.  

Now he recalled—among the three demonic path Golden Core cultivators who had besieged Turtle True Person at Turtle Fishing Island, one had indeed been named "Yan Yuanchun." Back then, everyone had been too busy fleeing for their lives to pay attention to such details.  

It seemed Protector Yan hadn’t bothered to conceal her identity. Did that mean Yichuan Market, as a neutral force, had ties with the demonic path? It appeared the righteous sects had rather weak control over the Yan Cloud Mountain region.  

"This junior failed to recognize you earlier. Please forgive my oversight!"  

"Enough of that."  

Yan Yuanchun waved her hand dismissively, uninterested in formalities. She simply instructed Lin Shan and the four Foundation Establishment female cultivators to follow her. With a flick of her jade-like hand, she tossed out an embroidered handkerchief depicting mandarin ducks frolicking in water.  

The handkerchief rapidly expanded until it was nearly a hundred meters wide. The embroidered mandarin ducks leaped out, followed by lakes, lotuses, pavilions, fish, and dragonflies—all coming to life as vivid illusions.  

Yan Yuanchun used this treasure as a massive flying vessel, boarding it with over a hundred female cultivators. Lin Shan followed suit, settling in a pavilion at the center of the illusory lake.  

With a gentle tremor, the handkerchief soared into the sky, carrying its passengers swiftly eastward. Countless mountains and rivers receded into the distance as Protector Yan sat at the front, meditating with her eyes closed.  

Lin Shan leaned out of the pavilion, examining the fish, dragonflies, and lotuses around him. With clouds drifting past, the scene felt like a dreamy fairyland.  

Unable to resist, he reached out to catch a dragonfly, wondering if these were real creatures. It was his first time witnessing such marvels, and he couldn’t help but be amazed.  

"Don’t bother. Those are all illusions, manifestations of the restrictions within Master’s treasure."  

Lin Shan turned toward the voice—it was Luan Chun, the little girl from before. Years had passed, but she still looked like a young maiden, her figure not quite matured.  

Or perhaps she had been on the verge of maturing, only to regress after breaking through to Foundation Establishment?  

Luan Chun grinned playfully at him, explaining the flying handkerchief beneath their feet while admiring the sea of clouds and the sprawling landscape below.  

"Treasures have their own mystical manifestations, but their owners can alter them at will.  

"This handkerchief’s illusionary ability can conjure an entire world as desired.  

"If Master wished, this lake and pavilion could instantly transform into a hellscape of bones, an abyssal chasm, or even a decadent pleasure den!"  

She stuck out her tongue at Lin Shan, her expression mocking, as if to say, *You country bumpkin, you know nothing. Better start flattering me!*  

Lin Shan’s expression turned odd. This Luan Chun was truly a shapeshifting little demoness. Back at the brothel, she had played the delicate, pitiable girl with a tragic backstory. Now she was acting all arrogant and domineering!  

"You still owe me five spirit stones!" Lin Shan said sternly, deciding to tease her.  

Luan Chun froze, then seemed to struggle to recall before finally remembering. She looked at him in disbelief.  

"You still remember such a trivial matter?"  

"Of course! Pay up!"  

Lin Shan was currently penniless, his storage bag empty. Having lived frugally for so long, he treated every spirit stone as precious. He felt particularly resentful toward Luan Chun for deceiving him with her fake tragic backstory.  

Of course, there was another reason—he really couldn’t handle her "flat chest"!  

"I don’t have any money!"  

"Besides, those three spirit stones for the music were just tea fees.  

"The other two were earned fair and square through my skills!  

"If I earned them with my skills, can you really call it cheating?"  

Luan Chun planted her hands on her hips, tilting her pretty little chin up with an air of righteous indignation.  

Lin Shan gritted his teeth but could do nothing about it. From her earlier words, it seemed she had become Protector Yan’s disciple. Reaching Foundation Establishment at such a young age, she was clearly favored by her master.  

Still, he refused to back down verbally, subtly probing for information he wanted.  

"Seems like all you can do is lie. Earlier, you claimed these lake scenes were illusions from the treasure’s restrictions, but who knows if you’re just making things up?"  

Luan Chun bristled at the accusation.  

"Making things up? You ignorant fool, don’t speak if you don’t know!  

"Every treasure has mystical manifestations—that’s what sets them above mere magical instruments!"  

Lin Shan scoffed. "What’s the use of mystical manifestations? Without a Golden Core cultivator’s power to control them, they’re useless. Unless they can act autonomously."  

Luan Chun snorted, lifting her delicate chin with a mocking smile, clearly viewing Lin Shan as a clueless bumpkin.  

"Autonomous combat? That would require a legendary spirit treasure!  

"Only spirit treasures possess sentient artifacts spirits capable of wielding partial power on their own.  

"Each spirit treasure is incredibly rare—even lofty Nascent Soul elders might not have one. Did you think they grow on trees?"  

Lin Shan’s mind stirred. The reason he hadn’t upgraded his high-grade magical instruments into treasures was precisely because he lacked Golden Core-level power to control them.  

But if treasures could be further enhanced into spirit treasures, capable of autonomous combat, wouldn’t that mean he could use them even at the Foundation Establishment stage?  

As he pondered this, Luan Chun, still in the pavilion with him, grew increasingly annoyed. She had been chattering away, only to realize Lin Shan was completely ignoring her!  

Fuming, the little girl stomped her foot and stormed off to another part of the handkerchief, determined to ignore him from now on.  

Lin Shan didn’t mind. He had wanted some peace and quiet anyway, to plan how he would search for ancient resonance in the demonic path once they arrived. Having no one to disturb him was ideal.  

The journey was long, and time passed swiftly.
