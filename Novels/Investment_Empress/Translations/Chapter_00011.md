# Chapter 11: Opening Meridians, Sister Wu Snaps to Attention

A figure flickered through the mountains.

Xue Jing couldn't help but feel his scalp tingle at the thought of his grand-disciple currently undergoing meridian opening under Shang Wu's tutelage.

Any later, and it wouldn't just be a matter of delaying his grand-disciple's cultivation.

He might have to perform emergency first aid on him.

This was no exaggeration at all.

His junior martial sister Shang Wu had once entertained the idea of taking a disciple. Everyone figured that since she had reached the Inner Scenery Realm at such a young age, even if she was usually unreliable, teaching a disciple would be a piece of cake for her. Thus, they tacitly agreed.

Who would have thought that on the very first day, that unlucky fellow would suffer qi deviation.

After that, Shang Wu never brought up taking disciples again, perhaps feeling it was uninteresting, or perhaps realizing she wasn't cut out to be a teacher.

Alas, that child Li Mo, despite his excellent talent, gave people a feeling of not knowing where to begin.

Other elders didn't know how to guide him, and their own true disciple slots were full.

Otherwise, how could a talent who once stood shoulder to shoulder with Ying Bing end up in such a hellhole?

Xue Jing no longer hoped that Li Mo could open his meridians in a single day like Ying Bing did.

Being safe and sound would be a blessing from the heavens.

Sighing, Xue Jing moved with the wind, his entire being seemingly merging with the clear breeze, his speed imperceptible to the naked eye.

In just a few breaths, he arrived at Qunyu Peak, carrying his medicine box.

However, before even reaching the summit, the worry on Xue Jing's face turned to confusion.

"Something's not right."

"Someone is drawing upon the origin energy of heaven and earth to cultivate?"

Drawing upon the origin energy of heaven and earth, also known as Heaven-Human Unity.

This state was coveted by all martial artists.

Cultivators needed to supplement themselves with food, elixirs, and the like to obtain the energy required to forge their qi and blood.

However, neither food nor elixirs could be consumed endlessly.

But, given a rare opportunity, a martial artist might achieve Heaven-Human Unity. This state was somewhat similar to the Outer Scenery Realm, where one's small inner world reflected and cycled with the vast outer world.

The speed of absorbing energy would be more than a hundred times faster!

Moreover, there were no side effects afterward, and there were even unexpected benefits.

"Shang Wu should be sleeping right now. Why is she cultivating today, and even in Heaven-Human Unity?"

Xue Jing quickened his pace.

On the summit.

Li Mo sat peacefully in front of the wooden house, his entire being seemingly integrated into nature.

Countless pores on his body seemed to have opened, constantly exchanging breath with the outside world.

It was as if his body had connected with heaven and earth.

To heaven and earth, he was like a tiny depression, causing the purest origin qi wandering between heaven and earth to surge towards him from all directions, as if to fill this hollow.

Faintly, Xue Jing could sense it.

Within that young man's dantian, a lotus seed seemed to have been planted.

It was currently frantically absorbing origin qi, moving towards sprouting, growing roots, and even blooming.

*Chirp*—

A soft sound.

Before Xue Jing could react with shock,

*Chirp*—

Another sound.

"After opening meridians, he unblocked another main meridian?"

Xue Jing's mouth hung open, his two long whiskers fluttering in the wind, his entire being falling into a daze.

Not only had he successfully opened his meridians.

But also!

Within a single day, he not only successfully opened his meridians but also unblocked a main meridian with unstoppable momentum.

Not only did he learn the *Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method* without guidance, but he also entered the Heaven-Human Unity state!

Xue Jing was questioning his life, unable to describe his feelings in words.

"Elder Xue, when did you arrive?"

Li Mo's ears twitched, and he opened his eyes.

"You... don't get distracted talking, Heaven-Human Unity is a rare and fleeting opportunity!"

Xue Jing was so anxious his beard bristled and his eyes widened.

"Huh? Heaven-Human Unity?"

Li Mo paused, bewildered, and said,

"But I kinda need to use the outhouse."

Old man Xue's eyes rolled back, *is this really the time for that?*

He was currently in the Inner Scenery Realm.

Heaven-Human Unity was like an early taste of the Outer Scenery Realm, an extremely precious and rare opportunity.

If this opportunity had been his, he would have a few more chances to advance to the next level.

This kid was completely unaware of its value, squandering God's gifts!

"Oh, alright."

Li Mo didn't know why Old Man Zhang seemed to suddenly lose his composure.

He had just moved from the sunny spot to under a tree because it was too bright, then continued cultivating, and the speed was still just as fast.

Could it be...

That others didn't cultivate like this?

Perhaps it was the benefit of the Profound Female Immortal Body...

Thinking this, Li Mo felt a little strange.

"The *Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method* states that opening twelve meridians and planting twelve lotus seeds signifies completion, reaching perfection in the Qi-Blood Realm."

"But... why do I feel like there's more?"

He could sense it.

Twelve main meridians were far from his limit.

His body felt like a bottomless pit.

The first and second meridians being connected didn't even count as a beginning.

"Forget it, I'll take it one step at a time."

"The foundation is very important; I must try to perfect it."

Li Mo closed his eyes, once again entering the cultivation state.

Meanwhile, Xue Jing kicked open the nearby wooden door and saw Shang Wu still sleeping soundly. His forehead twitched violently.

He took out a refreshing incense stick from his medicine box and waved it near her nose.

"Achoo!"

Shang Wu sneezed, her graceful face scrunching up.

Her beautiful dream interrupted twice in a row, she clenched her fists. Seeing that it was Elder Xue Jing, the nice old man of the sect, she impatiently said,

"Old man Xue, you better have a good reason."

"Your disciple is outside experiencing Heaven-Human Unity, and you're still sleeping? How can you sleep?"

Xue Jing said angrily.

"Are you drunk, or am I drunk?"

Shang Wu tilted her head, thinking Old Man Xue was talking nonsense.

"Why don't you go outside and see for yourself?"

Xue Jing finished, too lazy to argue with her further, and walked out the door.

Shang Wu's eyes were blurry for a moment, then she scratched her head and looked outside.

At that sight.

Sister Wu snapped to attention.

...

[Congratulations to Host, for demonstrating Heaven-Human Unity, inspiring insight in Xue Jing.]
[Congratulations to Host, for demonstrating Heaven-Human Unity, inspiring insight in Shang Wu.]
[Calculating rewards...]
[Investment Feedback: Three gourds of Ice-Fire Wine.]
[Investment Feedback: Twenty years of Martial Dao Enlightenment.]
[Ice-Fire Wine]: "After drinking, the dual tempering of ice and fire strengthens the physique. It is a sacred product for increasing physical strength."

Huh?

Watching me cultivate can also count as an investment?

These rewards are practically no different from the ones from Jianlai.

"Ice-Fire Wine..."

Li Mo decided not to try it out for now.

From his brief understanding of his master, if he took out any wine, there wouldn't be a drop left.

Coincidentally, he hadn't known how to refine his body yet.

Ice-Fire Wine was just the right thing for that.

After about two hours of cultivation, he really couldn't sit still anymore.

The muscle soreness and aches mentioned in the martial arts manual were absent, but his bladder was genuinely aching and full.

Thinking this, Li Mo stopped drawing from heaven and earth, patted his clothes, and stood up.

That peculiar state vanished.

The first thing he saw was Xue Jing, who reluctantly returned to his senses, then said with a face full of emotion:

"Old man, I owe you a favor."

At their age, bottlenecks were deeply entrenched, and making further progress after reaching a high level was extremely difficult.

Observing Heaven-Human Unity had greatly benefited him.

"Elder Xue, you exaggerate. My father often spoke of you at home."

Li Mo gracefully cupped his hands.

His father, Li Dalong, was once Xue Jing's disciple.

At that time, Xue Jing had not yet served as an elder.

"Hehehe, it's good that he still remembers this old man."

Xue Jing stroked his long beard and sighed, "Dalong, that child, it's truly a pity. If he hadn't encountered that accident, he would be an inner sect steward by now."

Old Xue's appearance seemed similar in age to Li Mo's father.

But Li Mo knew that when his father first joined the sect, Xue Jing already looked like this middle-aged man.

His true age was probably much greater than ninety-six.

Li Mo spoke at an opportune moment:

"Everyone has their own destiny. Father said that he only survived thanks to Elder Xue's intervention."

"If Father hadn't met Mother on his way back home after being injured, I wouldn't exist."

"To lose something at dawn and gain something at dusk, that's exactly it."

Young Li was skilled at buttering up elders.

"Dalong is a fortunate man."

Xue Jing looked at Li Mo with even more relief.

This kid was nothing like the unruly one Li Dalong described in his letters.

Perhaps a father always viewed his son more strictly.

The atmosphere between the old and young was pleasant.

Suddenly, Li Mo smelled alcohol, then his neck tightened, and he felt a choke.

Shang Wu, embracing her only beloved disciple's neck, vigilantly declared her ownership:

"Hey, hey, hey, this is my disciple! Don't you old coot think about poaching him."

"I would like to, but where would I find an open slot for a disciple?"

Xue Jing said grumpily.

Looking at the boisterous Shang Wu, he felt a slight headache.

His grand-disciple was a promising talent; he hoped Shang Wu wouldn't lead him astray.

A little lack of skill was minor, but a good child shouldn't pick up those bad habits.

"Xiao Mo, if you want to verify your martial arts or find someone to spar with, why not check out the Martial Arts Hall down the mountain?"

Shang Wu's almond eyes narrowed for a moment, then she nodded:

"For learning some basic moves, the Martial Arts Hall should suffice."

Li Mo: "..."

Sister, you're just too lazy to teach, aren't you?

However, now that he had a cultivation method, he indeed planned to learn some martial skills.

Going to the Martial Arts Hall would also allow him to look for potential investment targets, so it was a good place to go.
