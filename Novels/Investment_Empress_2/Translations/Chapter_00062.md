# Chapter 62: Girl, Do You Want to Become Strong?

Primordial Heavenly尊 (Primordial Heavenly Sovereign)!

Jiang Chulong had never heard of him.

But in her understanding, the supreme powerhouses of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands would add the character "Heaven" to their titles.

For example, the Great Yu Ancestor Martial Emperor was titled "Hong Tian."

Heavenly尊?

Doesn't that mean being revered by the Nine Heavens, standing above them?

Just by this title alone, it was enough to show that the man's strength was unfathomable.

After all.

If an ordinary person dared to call themselves a Heavenly尊, they would likely only be able to go out at noon, because they would inevitably meet their doom sooner or later.

Moreover.

A mere name could cause the heavens and earth to change color, resonating mysteriously.

Could it be that he is even stronger than the Nine Heavens?

If that were true, it would be terrifying!

"Drink the tea."

A misty voice sounded, and the anomalies in the heavens and earth vanished instantly, as if everything that had just happened was an illusion.

Jiang Chulong's mind went blank, and she nodded dumbly.

As the tea entered her mouth.

A pure vitality diffused within her stomach.

She had seen this item before. It was a tribute offered to the Central Plains by a major sect, which the Emperor had rewarded to many of her brothers and sisters, but never to her. The Eldest Prince, seeing her pitiful state, had shared a little with her.

Jiang Chulong glanced sideways and noticed a spring nearby. This mysterious man had used the spring water to brew the tea...

"The reason you are here is that I dropped an Ancient Intent Ring many years ago."

"Only those with great fortune and outstanding talent can resonate with it."

The Primordial Heavenly尊 across from her raised his tea cup.

His hand paused, but he didn't drink. He just held it in his palm, toying with it.

"So... it was because of the ring..."

Jiang Chulong suddenly understood.

Great fortune?

Outstanding talent?

"Um... He... Heavenly尊 Senior."

"I... I might not be... the person you are looking for."

Jiang Chulong lowered her head, almost burying it in her chest.

Her birth had caused her mother's death, so she had been disliked by Emperor Jingtai since childhood, almost to the point of being hated. She didn't know this when she was young; she thought that all the Emperor's children lived in the Cold Palace and had no new clothes to wear.

Even on the Emperor's birthday, a day of universal celebration, if she secretly sneaked in to catch a glimpse of her father, it would turn the banquet into a torture chamber. The palace maid who inadvertently leaked information to her stared at her with eyes full of blood as she was executed by a thousand cuts.

As for talent...

Talent?

She had never practiced martial arts, and no one dared to teach her.

But she knew that without the bone in her chest, she was no genius.

The Eldest Prince, who possessed the True Dragon Physique and had taken that bone, was the real genius...

"Haha... Little girl, are you doubting my eyesight?"

"No... I wouldn't dare..."

"Jiang Chulong, the youngest daughter of Emperor Jingtai."

A calm and soothing voice reached her ears.

Jiang Chulong froze.

She hadn't introduced herself?

How did the Heavenly尊 Senior know?

"Born with a Sword Spirit, possessing the Heavenly尊 Emperor Sword Bone, yet it was stolen by kin."

"Currently, you are being hunted by the Patrol Sky Guards."

Jiang Chulong: "!"

Her small mouth opened slightly.

Why does the Heavenly尊 Senior know everything?

In fact, she didn't even know the name of the extra bone in her chest.

"To obtain the Ancient Intent Ring and stand before me, how can you not be considered to have great fortune?"

"But... but that... bone... I don't have it anymore."

Jiang Chulong bit her lips until they turned white.

Heavenly尊 Emperor Sword Bone.

This Senior is also called Primordial Heavenly尊.

It must be because of this reason that he summoned her.

"That is a good thing," the Primordial Heavenly尊 said indifferently.

"Ah?"

Jiang Chulong's eyes widened, filled with confusion.

"A Sword Bone can help someone achieve greatness, but it can also shackle them."

"Losing the Sword Bone allows you to walk your own path. How is that not a good thing?"

"In the Desolate Realm, there was a child whose Supreme Bone was dug out. Later, he grew a second, and even a third."

"One day, when you stand higher and look back, all of this will be but a passing cloud."

The indifferent tone made one inexplicably convinced.

It was as if the so-called Sword Bone was just an ordinary thing.

"Stand higher?"

Jiang Chulong was confused.

The Desolate Realm?

Supreme Bone?

She didn't quite understand, but it sounded very powerful.

But she used to stand quite high too... If the Sword Bone wasn't important, why did the Eldest Prince steal it?

"You are still young and ignorant, which is normal."

The Primordial Heavenly尊 laughed, seemingly helpless at the girl's ignorance:

"The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands have a long history. The Great Yu Dynasty is not even a splash in the river of time."

"In the Ancient Times, the Heavenly Court governed the Thirty-Three Heavens, controlled the stars of the universe, and created all things in the world."

"The ruler of the Heavenly Court back then was called the Haotian God-Emperor. He underwent 103,000 tribulations, each lasting 129,600 years, and finally grasped the Great Dao."

He didn't just speak.

He even showed animations.

The white clouds in the sky began to gather and disperse slowly along with the Primordial Heavenly尊's narration, manifesting thousands of scenes.

Ten thousand rays of golden light, a thousand strands of auspicious color.

Through the massive South Heaven Gate, thirty-three treasure halls were arranged, seventy-two palaces shone like the stars, and various true dragons and phoenixes soared and danced.

Purple glow elixirs were held in agate plates, and the endless Jade Trees in the Guanghan Palace.

It created a vivid sense of immersion.

Jiang Chulong's eyes reflected the scenery of this Heavenly Palace, and she was mesmerized.

This was just a manifestation in the clouds.

If it were the real Heavenly Court, wouldn't it be even more breathtaking?

She could already glimpse the glory of the Ancient Times from this lingering radiance.

The Heavenly尊 Senior really wasn't exaggerating.

Compared to this, the Great Yu Dynasty was indeed nothing.

Moreover...

103,000 tribulations, each lasting 129,600 years?

Jiang Chulong didn't bother to count on her small fingers this time.

It definitely wouldn't be enough.

*Hum—*

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew, and the clouds and mist dispersed.

The Primordial Heavenly尊's voice rang out with a sense of loss:

"All things have an end. If one fails to achieve immortality, they will eventually perish in the passage of time."

"I am now but a remnant soul."

"A remnant soul?!"

Jiang Chulong's heart tightened.

Just a remnant soul was already so unfathomable and god-like. What was the Primordial Heavenly尊 like at his peak?

"Haha... Things are unpredictable."

"I never expected that a ring I casually tossed down countless eons ago would take root and sprout."

"Exactly!"

"I wish to accept you as my disciple and teach you everything I know."

"My request is simple: when your strength is sufficient, help me revive and return!"

"Girl, do you want to become strong?"

The Primordial Heavenly尊' words carried an undeniable confidence and infinite assurance.

*Do you want to become strong?*

*Do you want to become strong?*

Jiang Chulong covered her chest, as if removing her hand would cause her heart to leap out from these words.

Her?

To help the Heavenly尊 Senior, it must be incredibly difficult...

In that instant, her mother's tombstone, her father's cold face, the Eldest Prince's blood-stained dagger, and Aunt Mei's resolute expression as she drew the Patrol Sky Guards away flashed before her eyes.

She wanted to.

And she didn't know how to refuse.

"Um... I... I am willing."

"Louder, I can't hear you."

"I am willing!"

"Good! Very spirited!"
