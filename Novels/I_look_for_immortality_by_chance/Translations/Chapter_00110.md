# Chapter 110: Top Seven Grades and Fierce Battles (Combined)

The Flowing Cloud Banquet bestowed ten spiritual energies in total. The first seven corresponded to the Seven Great True Diagrams of the Dao Academy.

These seven spiritual energies were all of the highest quality. As long as one comprehended the Foundation Establishment method, the success rate of establishing a foundation reached eighty percent. Moreover, the spiritual energy was extremely dense. Once the foundation was successfully established, it could be transformed into profound mana, saving ten years of arduous cultivation.

These first seven spots were also known as the "Top Seven Grades" of the Flowing Cloud Banquet, holding extraordinary significance.

However, due to the large number of disciples in the Dao Academy, many from the Seven Peaks, noble families, and commoner backgrounds cultivated the same True Diagrams. Sometimes, dozens of disciples practiced the same technique simultaneously.

Thus, a single spiritual energy was clearly insufficient to distribute fairly.

Therefore, the Dao Academy bestowed ten spiritual energies each time. The last three were opportunities for disciples who failed to obtain the Top Seven Grades to compete again.

As long as one emerged victorious in the last three battles, the Dao Academy would bestow a corresponding spiritual energy based on the victor's technique.

However, this spiritual energy was not of the highest quality—it was merely upper-grade, with a seventy percent chance of successful Foundation Establishment and no ability to transform into mana.

At this moment, the first spiritual energy released by the elder was the Azure Rainbow Golden Cloud Qi, one of the highest-grade spiritual energies.

This was the spiritual energy required for the Foundation Establishment of the Purple Lightning Azure Rainbow True Diagram. Once refined, it could forge the "Azure Rainbow Dao Foundation," granting swift and ethereal movement akin to lightning and rainbows. The sword seals cultivated through it would possess extraordinary abilities, making it one of the secret transmissions of the Dao Academy. Generally, only disciples from the Seven Peaks and noble families had the opportunity to practice it.

As this wisp of spiritual energy appeared, a white jade platform quietly rose at the front of the grand hall.

The Azure Rainbow Golden Cloud Qi hovered above the jade platform, flickering in and out of sight. Moreover, a cyan-green token also spun endlessly on the platform, intertwined with the spiritual energy.

"You all should know that this Flowing Cloud Banquet is of extraordinary significance. The victor will not only obtain the highest-grade spiritual energy but also enter the Ancient Mountain Secret Realm to compete for the remaining twenty strands of heaven and earth's spiritual energy."

"The spiritual energy and token are both on the jade platform. Disciples may step forward freely!"

The elder suspended the spiritual energy and token above the jade platform before addressing the crowd below once more.

"I'll go first!"

As soon as the elder finished speaking, a handsome young man clad in a nine-leaf Daoist robe emerged from the seating area of the Azure Flame Peak.

With sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, he stood with his hands behind his back, a cyan-green longsword hanging at his waist, exuding the aura of a worldly swordsman and an air of unrestrained confidence.

He soared into the air and leisurely stepped onto the jade platform, surveying the crowd in the hall before declaring loudly, "Xiao Yi of the Azure Flame Peak wishes to claim this spiritual energy. If any junior brother disagrees, come forth and challenge me!"

His eyes were sharp as swords, domineering and imposing, radiating intense pressure as he scanned the crowd.

The commoner disciples remained silent.

The reason was simple—commoner disciples had no access to the Purple Lightning Azure Rainbow True Diagram.

Traditionally, only the Seven Peaks and noble families could teach the commoners the three lower techniques, while commoners were barred from learning the four True Diagrams of the Seven Peaks and noble families.

Unless one had a fortuitous encounter and abandoned the Dao Academy's True Diagrams to practice another method, there was no reason to compete for this golden sword energy.

Though rare, such cases were not unheard of in the academy's history. However, at this moment, none of the commoner disciples seemed to have such an opportunity, so they remained silent.

The disciples of the Seven Peaks exchanged glances but also stayed quiet.

Yet, from the noble families' seating area, a voice rang out.

"Elder Brother Xiao, among peers of the same realm, seniority is not determined by age but by cultivation."

"You may be older than me, but that doesn't necessarily make you my senior!"

Gu Yuan looked over and saw a white-robed youth stepping forward from the Zhou family's seating area.

The youth had rosy lips and pearly teeth, appearing no older than twenty, with a hint of youthful innocence and faint fuzz above his lips.

However, his response to Xiao Yi's challenge was sharp and unyielding, his eyes gleaming with an even fiercer sword light. In two strides, he stepped onto the jade platform.

"Then I shall witness the Zhou family's famed 'Heart's Mirror Swordsmanship'!"

Xiao Yi's eyes turned cold as a golden sword light flashed toward the youth.

Simultaneously, the void trembled with golden sword howls, carrying an overwhelming killing intent that assaulted the youth's consciousness.

Golden Howl Spirit Sense!

A top-grade spirit sense refined from Golden Howl Spirit Water.

Yet the youth merely sneered. His consciousness resonated with the same golden howl, clashing against Xiao Yi's spiritual attack.

Not only that, his spirit sense seemed superior—its golden radiance was dazzling and solid, instantly overwhelming Xiao Yi's.

"Slash!"

At the same time, he shouted lightly, and thousands of sword lights surged from his hand like a torrential downpour, meeting Xiao Yi's golden sword light head-on.

"Clang!"

The clashing of metal rang incessantly as countless sword shadows crisscrossed on the platform, creating a dazzling spectacle.

The spectators all wore grave expressions, especially the commoner disciples.

The two on the platform were both devoted to the sword, and the killing intent radiating from their swordplay sent chills down the spine. They couldn't help but wonder—if they were in that position, how many moves could they withstand?

This was a duel between the most talented disciples of the Dao Academy, not to be underestimated.

"Boom!"

The sword lights were as dazzling as rain, as though two monstrous beings formed of sword energy were locked in fierce combat. Stray sword rays tore through the air, emitting piercing shrieks.

The duel between the two lacked flashy techniques or mystical seals—they simply piled on sword lights, making them faster and sharper.

"Rip!"

Swordsmen's duels were decided quickly.

In just a few breaths, a gruesome wound split open on Xiao Yi's chest, blood gushing as his organs became faintly visible.

In contrast, the Zhou youth only had a torn sleeve.

The difference was clear.

Xiao Yi's face turned deathly pale, as though his soul had left his body in disbelief.

"I concede, Junior Brother Xiao!"

The Zhou youth clasped his hands behind his back and smiled faintly at Xiao Yi.

"Swish!"

The elder at the front of the hall flicked his fingers, sending a streak of emerald light to Xiao Yi's chest, healing his wound.

"Since you've lost, step down and recuperate. The lower three grades may still offer another chance."

At these words, Xiao Yi's face grew even paler. He took several deep breaths to suppress his turbulent emotions before bowing to the Zhou youth and returning to his seat, though his steps were unsteady.

"Fellow disciples, is there anyone else who wishes to claim the Azure Rainbow Golden Cloud Qi? Zhou Jun is ready to face all challengers!"

The Zhou youth, brimming with confidence, addressed the crowd below.

The path to victory was not about quantity but quality.

Xiao Yi was the top swordsman among the Qi Refinement disciples of the Azure Flame Peak in this generation, having defeated countless peers along the way. Defeating Xiao Yi meant surpassing countless others.

Now, riding the momentum of his victory, he challenged the crowd, and none dared respond.

Among the Azure Flame Peak's seating, a young man seemed eager to step forward but was held back by Xiao Yi.

Seeing this, Zhou Jun laughed heartily, flicked his sleeve to collect the Azure Rainbow Golden Cloud Qi and the token, and leisurely returned to his seat.

After this battle, the atmosphere in the hall became polarized—some were sweating nervously, while others burned with fighting spirit.

The elder waved his sleeve again, releasing another crimson-gold spiritual energy entwined with a token, which hovered above the jade platform like a soaring flame.

"Crimson Flame Flowing Light Qi!"

"The material for forging the Golden Sun Dao Foundation. Who wishes to claim it?"

Before the elder finished speaking, several voices rang out.

"I will!"

"I will!"

From the Seven Peaks, noble families, and commoner backgrounds, figures rose into the air, eager to seize this spiritual energy.

Clearly, many cultivated fire-based True Diagrams.

Gu Yuan suddenly understood why Bian Chuyao had been so determined to obtain the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit.

Without it, she would have had no certainty of claiming the spiritual energy.

"A commoner disciple dares to vie for the highest-grade spiritual energy?"

As he was closer to the jade platform, a broad-browed, thin-lipped young man from the Seven Peaks was the first to step onto it.

This was the same disciple who had earlier wanted to avenge Xiao Yi.

He glanced warily at the noble families' side before turning his mocking gaze toward the commoner disciple who had risen to challenge.

"Are commoner disciples not disciples of the Dao Academy?"

"You've reached the ninth level of Qi Refinement, and so have I. You've comprehended the Foundation Establishment method—why can't I? If you can compete for the Crimson Flame Flowing Light Qi, so can I!"

The commoner disciple had an ordinary appearance and seemed somewhat aged, with a trace of weariness in his eyes. However, his features hadn't visibly aged—likely due to daily hardships giving him a slightly weathered look.

Facing the Azure Flame Peak disciple's taunt, he retorted unyieldingly, his presence as solid as a mountain.

Moreover, he moved swiftly, stepping onto the jade platform before the noble family disciple could.

Seeing this, the noble family disciple halted and watched the two with interest.

The Flowing Cloud Banquet's duels didn't account for consecutive battles.

After each victory, a Foundation Establishment elder would assist the victor in recovering their mana before the next bout.

The duels continued until no one else challenged.

The Dao Academy intended to use this banquet to test the mettle of its disciples.

There was no rush—let the battles unfold slowly.

"Commoner disciples cannot cultivate the upper four True Diagrams. Have you switched to another method?"

Seeing the commoner disciple disregard his status, the Azure Flame Peak disciple grew angry and demanded harshly.

"What does it matter to you? The Dao Academy never forbids disciples from switching techniques. If one attains the Great Dao, it only enriches the academy's heritage!"

The commoner disciple replied indifferently.

This was the truth—the Dao Academy welcomed disciples mastering diverse techniques. If one achieved the Golden Core realm and established their own peak, it would mean another True Diagram for the academy.

The noble families and Seven Peaks could cultivate the upper four True Diagrams because these diagrams were obtained by the Golden Core elders after the founding of Qingfeng Dao Academy, granting their descendants and disciples more choices.

"Sharp tongue!"

Seeing the disciple show no respect, the Azure Flame Peak disciple flew into a rage. He unleashed several seals, summoning a sea of azure flames that surged toward the commoner disciple like a raging river.

"Flame Devouring Heaven Reversal Seal!"

The commoner disciple sneered inwardly and opened his mouth, swallowing the vast sea of flames whole.

"Azure Flame Seal!"

The Azure Flame Peak disciple's expression changed. He quickly formed another secret seal, summoning a rain of fire to assault the commoner disciple.

Yet the disciple simply opened his mouth again, devouring all the flames as though his belly contained a universe capable of holding endless azure fire.

"What kind of seal is this?!"

The Azure Flame Peak disciple paled, but the commoner disciple ignored him. With a single exhale, a streak of emerald fire shot out like a coiling dragon, slamming the youth off the platform.

"Bang!"

The outcome was decided instantly. The youth's face turned deathly white, as though unwilling to accept defeat, but the elder flicked his sleeve, sending him back to his seat.

"Excellent!"

The elder glanced at the commoner disciple on the platform and smiled faintly.

This was the purpose of the Flowing Cloud Banquet.

Great waves sift the sand to reveal gold.

There would always be those who rose to prominence through extraordinary circumstances.

This scene left all fire-technique cultivators in the hall stunned.

The noble family disciple who had intended to challenge earlier also wore a grave expression.

After a brief hesitation, he steeled himself and stepped onto the platform.

"Boom!"

Flames surged once more, but the outcome was the same. The commoner disciple's belly seemed to contain something that countered all fire techniques. In mere moments, he defeated the noble family disciple and stood victorious on the platform.

This shocked everyone, especially the commoner disciples, who were greatly inspired.

Yet Gu Yuan shook his head slightly, feeling pity for the disciple.

As he sighed, a soft voice echoed through the hall.

"Elder Brother, Chuyao would like to learn from you. May I?"

Bian Chuyao, her skin as fair as snow, stepped onto the jade platform with a gentle smile.

All eyes turned to her. The noble family disciples watched with anticipation, while the commoner disciples fixed their gazes on the two.

The commoner disciple remained unfazed by the attention and said loudly, "Junior Sister, please!"

"Then I shall ask for your guidance, Elder Brother!"

Bian Chuyao smiled before golden flames coalesced into the shape of a dragon from her sleeves, charging toward the disciple.

The fire dragon was lifelike, covered in scales, its body shimmering like molten gold—a truly mystical sight.

The commoner disciple's expression grew serious, but he showed no panic. He opened his mouth and swallowed the golden fire dragon in one gulp.

Yet Bian Chuyao merely smiled faintly and released another golden fire dragon from her sleeve.

The disciple's face changed. He inhaled again, drawing the second dragon into his belly.

But Bian Chuyao pointed a finger, summoning yet another fire dragon.

Three, four, five... In an instant, it was as though a swarm of dragons danced in the air, a breathtaking spectacle.

After consuming the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit, Bian Chuyao's mana had fully transformed into Crimson Flame Flowing Gold. Combined with her clan's secret seals, her fire techniques had reached an unimaginable level—a single wave of her hand could summon a sea of flames.

As long as her mana held, the fire dragons would continue to manifest endlessly.

At this moment, she seemed like the sovereign of flames.

The commoner disciple, glancing at the Crimson Flame Flowing Light Qi and the cyan-green token, clenched his teeth and activated the seal in his belly with all his might, devouring the fire dragons before him.

Even as his abdomen swelled like a pregnant woman's, his robe straining against his bulging belly and crimson veins surfacing on his skin, he refused to yield.

Bian Chuyao sighed but showed no mercy, channeling her mana ceaselessly to summon more fire dragons.

"Enough!"

"There's still a chance in the lower three grades. Don't push yourself!"

Finally, the elder intervened. With a wave of his sleeve, a golden light struck the commoner disciple.

"Ugh!"

The disciple retched violently, spewing golden flames like a tide.

As the flames were expelled, his swollen belly gradually deflated, but his face remained ashen, his eyes filled with unwillingness as he stared at the spiritual energy and token on the platform.

"Senior Sister's fire techniques are unparalleled. I admit defeat."

Yet he was reasonable and didn't make a scene. Bowing to Bian Chuyao, he staggered away.

Witnessing this, all the commoner disciples fell silent, their morale crushed.

"What is your name, and which cave do you cultivate in?"

Bian Chuyao's eyes flickered as she addressed the commoner disciple.

"Ma Wu, from the Three Flames Cave."

The disciple was unsure of her intentions but hesitated before answering.

Wishing everyone a Happy New Year!
