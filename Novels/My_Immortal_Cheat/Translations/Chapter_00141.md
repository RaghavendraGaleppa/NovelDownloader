**Chapter 141: Crushing**

Zheng Yusheng found it hard to believe, his eyes burning with a brilliant white light. This was a special pupil technique, using the vast righteous qi he had nurtured to dispel all illusions. He refused to believe this was Zhou Tian's true strength.

"Ah…"

Zheng Yusheng let out a shriek as two streaks of blood flowed from his eyes. In his recent vision, Zhou Tian had transformed into a resplendent great sun, impossible to look at directly, causing a backlash against him.

"This…"

Some people were struck dumb with horror, utterly unwilling to believe.

"It can't be a Great Emperor, it can't be a Great Emperor!"

Others murmured to themselves, looking like madmen. That was a Great Emperor! Not a Saint, nor a Saint King, but a Great Emperor! Even if Zhou Tian had begun cultivating from his mother's womb, he couldn't possibly reach the Great Emperor realm.

According to existing records, achieving the Great Emperor realm within ten thousand years was already considered genius, let alone how young Zhou Tian was.

Even the true prodigies among them struggled to remain calm, though their Dao Hearts were firm, preventing them from making a fool of themselves. Many thoughts ran through their minds, and most recalled Zhou Tian's earlier shout, "Dark Dragon Nine Seals," which seemed to be a type of seal. Their eyes flickered as they considered many possibilities.

Zhou Zui and the others were also somewhat bewildered. They had grown up with Zhou Tian, and while they had noticed his unique abilities since childhood, and even though he seemed a little different recently, it was simply impossible for him to have reached the Great Emperor realm.

Only Tian Ling showed no surprise, her gaze fixed intently on the arena, a strange light shimmering in her eyes.

"Sister Tian Ling, do you know what's going on with Zhou Tian?" Liu Yan asked tentatively.

"No idea," Tian Ling blinked her big eyes, wondering why Liu Yan was asking.

"Then why aren't you surprised?"

"Because he's Zhou Tian."

"…………"

Liu Yan was speechless, sighing inwardly, "Oh, women."

In the arena, Zhou Tian watched Zheng Yusheng's peculiar actions. He had already sensed that the other party was using a peeking technique to probe him. He hadn't made any move; his body's automatic response alone had caused the backlash. After all, he was currently in the Great Emperor realm, impervious to all myriad laws.

"You have eight seconds left. If you can even touch the corner of my clothes, you win. I keep my word." Zhou Tian kindly reminded him.

Zheng Yusheng's face fluctuated between dark and pale. To this moment, he still couldn't believe Zhou Tian was a Great Emperor. He clearly knew the difficulty of cultivating to that realm; it wasn't something talent could compensate for; it required the accumulation of immense time.

"You are absolutely not a Great Emperor!" Zheng Yusheng roared, as if speaking to Zhou Tian, but also to himself. He needed to build confidence, otherwise, without Zhou Tian even lifting a finger, he would be crushed by Zhou Tian's overwhelming presence.

Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow, saying nothing. *Believe what you want, when my palm comes down, you'll have no choice but to believe.*

Zheng Yusheng's body glowed, and he opened his mouth to spit out a long white river. Within it, light shimmered and stars revolved, dazzling incomparably, like the Milky Way descending from the nine heavens.

Around his body, streaks of white-robed phantoms appeared, all holding books and chanting. The white river grew continuously, and finally, all the white-robed phantoms merged into it, emitting countless rays of light.

The white river charged forward with an irresistible force. Within the river, a brilliant and flourishing scene appeared: the phantom of a Dao-spreader from primordial times, and little children babbling and reading aloud. This was the manifestation of enlightening all beings.

"This is the Dao-Spreading Tome, the top cultivation method of the Great Luo Academy's Confucian Institute, said to have been passed down by an ancient Human Dao Supreme Saint."

Someone's eyes shone with divine light, a glimmer of hope appearing within them. At this point, almost everyone sided with Zheng Yusheng, not because they were hostile to Zhou Tian, but because they refused to believe Zhou Tian had reached the Great Emperor realm. They hoped Zheng Yusheng would prove it was just an illusion.

"Alright, the special effects are decent, but the power is still lacking. Since you want to enlighten the world, then I shall bring chaos to the world! One Qi Transforms Ten Thousand Spirits!"

Zhou Tian lightly pointed a finger. A streak of clear qi emerged, then evolved, transcending the mundane and entering sainthood, unfathomable, transforming into ten thousand spirits. Figures filled the sky, vast and boundless.

At this moment, not only Zheng Yusheng, but everyone else, including the true prodigies, was astonished, somewhat petrified. The sight was too shocking.

Tens of thousands of living beings, blotting out the sky, were everywhere. There were golden four-winged divine tigers, standing on the ground, roaring at the sky. There were platinum lions as large as mountains, with manes like waterfalls, immensely powerful, their roars tearing space apart. There were cloud-like Heaven-Rending Sparrows, casting vast shadows on the ground, their eyes as large and crimson as blood moons.

This was raw, primal wildness, for Zheng Yusheng to "enlighten"! This was the simplest form of energy manifestation, without any technical complexity, purely relying on cultivation to crush. These creatures were all imagined by Zhou Tian at will; whether they truly existed in this world was debatable.

Zheng Yusheng's heart trembled. No one could remain calm in the face of such a spectacle. Any one of these ethereal creatures had a higher cultivation than him.

*Crack!*

A crimson True Dragon swung its tail, its powerful tail directly smashing Zheng Yusheng's white river, then charging straight towards Zheng Yusheng.

The hidden Elder Fool had already prepared to intervene. The situation had now exceeded his expectations. He was not one of those junior Dharma Aspect realm cultivators; he saw clearly that Zhou Tian was truly in the Great Emperor realm. If he intervened even a moment too late, Zheng Yusheng might be reduced to a pile of ashes.

However, those terrifying ten thousand spirits dissipated directly, turning into streams of light and vanishing. It was Zhou Tian who had withdrawn them.

Elder Fool sighed, looking at Zheng Yusheng with a pitiful expression. Zhou Tian was clearly toying with him to death.

"You have six seconds left. I keep my word." Zhou Tian's voice boomed like thunder, echoing in Zheng Yusheng's ears.

Zheng Yusheng's face was ashen, his lips trembling, but he couldn't speak. Zhou Tian was too dismissive of him, yet he was powerless. The disparity in strength was too vast, leaving him with no options.

"Five." Zhou Tian softly counted down.

"Four." Each count was like an ancient divine elephant stomping on Zheng Yusheng's heart with its colossal foot.

"Three." Zheng Yusheng's face grew even paler. He could surrender, but he was unwilling. No one had ever surrendered in this arena before because it was a non-life-threatening match. If he surrendered now, his future cultivation path would be stunted.

More and more spectators gathered from outside, many having rushed over after hearing that a major anomaly had occurred here, with a Great Emperor appearing among the younger generation. No one believed it, but they all came to witness it.

Under the explanation of friends who had been watching from the start, everyone looked at Zhou Tian with shocked expressions.

"Two." Zhou Tian continued the countdown.

"Wah!" Zheng Yusheng vomited a mouthful of fresh blood. A suffocating feeling in his heart found no release, forcing him to spit blood.

"One." Zhou Tian uttered the final number, then smiled faintly.

"My turn."
