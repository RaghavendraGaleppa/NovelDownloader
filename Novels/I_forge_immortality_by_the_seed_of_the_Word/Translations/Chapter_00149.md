# Chapter 146: Senior Brother's Generous Gift

**Longevity Spring?**

Judging by its name, it seemed to be a treasure related to lifespan.  

From what Zhang Jing knew, anything involving lifespan was considered extremely precious, even in the Celestial Realm. Yet this senior brother before him was casually gifting it away?  

Was Senior Brother Xuan simply generous, or were the disciples of the Daoist Heavenly Abode so wealthy—or perhaps both?  

Suppressing his astonishment, Zhang Jing gently accepted the mystical spring handed to him and said gratefully,  

"Thank you, Senior Brother Xuan."  

The leading golden-robed Daoist, named Xuan Yuan, hailed from the same lower realm as Zhang Jing—the Jun Tian Domain. He had ascended to the upper realm's Daoist sect 13,000 years ago and had now reached the Dharma Form Realm.  

As Zhang Jing spoke, a relaxed smile appeared on Xuan Yuan's face as he explained,  

"Junior Brother, later, choose a spot on your immortal island to place this Longevity Spring. I obtained this spring by chance in the Longevity Secret Realm. Drinking its water once can preserve one's youthful appearance for 300 years."  

"Even more remarkable is that the spring condenses one drop of Longevity Spirit Liquid each year. A single drop can extend one's lifespan by 30 years. However, a person can only consume nine drops at most—any more than that will have no effect. Any unused Longevity Spirit Liquid can be sold at the Multiverse Auction House in the Radiant Immortal World for about 200,000 to 300,000 units of fortune per drop."  

Hearing this, Zhang Jing's expression turned solemn.  

The mere fact that the Longevity Spring could extend one's lifespan by 270 years was already extraordinary.  

For those on the immortal path, 270 years could mean the difference between a breakthrough or stagnation.  

For mortals, it was even more precious—equivalent to living three extra lifetimes.  

More importantly, the Longevity Spring was essentially an inexhaustible source of fortune.  

As for the value of fortune, Zhang Jing had already witnessed it firsthand.  

With this in mind, he couldn't help but express his gratitude again,  

"Thank you for such a generous gift, Senior Brother."  

"Haha, it's just a small trinket. The Longevity Secret Realm has many similar items. I'm glad you like it," Xuan Yuan said magnanimously.  

*Longevity Secret Realm?* A trace of curiosity arose in Zhang Jing's heart.  

At the same time, the other two Daoists stepped forward.  

The green-robed Daoist took out a nine-inch-long red string, while the white-robed Daoist with a golden mark on his forehead produced a seed enveloped in tri-colored immortal light.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, congratulations on becoming a disciple of the True Monarch. May your immortal path be boundless," they said in unison.  

"Thank you, Senior Brothers!" Zhang Jing replied with a smile.  

"Junior Brother, this red string is called the Nine-Inch Fate Thread. It was woven by the Moon Elder, a deity from the Immortal Lake Secret Realm. Tie one end to your wrist and the other to the wrist of a female cultivator you fancy. As long as her cultivation hasn't surpassed the Heavenly Immortal Realm, she will fall irrevocably in love with you."  

"However, the effect only lasts nine years."  

"What do you think? Isn't this a great gift?"  

The green-robed Daoist grinned as he introduced it, a hint of mischief flashing across his face.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother Gu," Zhang Jing said, cupping his hands in gratitude, though a trace of helplessness flickered in his eyes.  

*What would I even do with this thing?*  

Meanwhile, the white-robed Daoist with the golden mark teased,  

"Senior Brother Gu, just how many Fate Threads do you have? Why is this always the gift you bring?"  

"The Moon Elder is my sworn father. Got a problem with that? Junior Brother Qing, if you want a Fate Thread, just ask. I may not have much else, but I’ve got plenty of these," the green-robed Daoist boasted proudly.  

Hearing this, the white-robed Daoist froze for a moment before shaking his head, deciding not to engage further with this incorrigible senior brother.  

Turning to Zhang Jing, his expression grew somewhat complicated as he said,  

"Junior Brother, what I’m giving you is a seed of the 'Three Radiance Peach Tree.'"  

"This Three Radiance Peach Tree is a divine immortal root from the Immortal Lake Secret Realm. As it grows, it absorbs the essence of the sun, moon, and stars. Every 900 years, it bears fruit—three types, in fact. The first is the Longevity Peach, the second the Yin Peach, and the third the Yang Peach, each with extraordinary effects."  

"In the Immortal Lake Secret Realm, whenever these peaches ripen, they attract countless covetous gazes. Unfortunately, the Peach Guardian ensures only those fated can obtain a single fruit. Someone once offered 30 million units of fortune for a Yin Peach but was refused. That should give you an idea of its rarity."  

"Fifteen hundred years ago, I was fortunate enough to receive a seed from the Peach Guardian. Yet despite a millennium of effort, I could never get it to sprout. Perhaps I simply lack the affinity with immortal roots. Now, I pass it on to you, Junior Brother."  

"Thank you, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said gratefully as he accepted the seed.  

As time passed, Zhang Jing gradually grew more familiar with the three senior brothers, and their conversation became increasingly lively.  

Through the information they shared, Zhang Jing slowly pieced together an outline of the Chiming Taihao Heavenly Abode.  

The Chiming Taihao Heavenly Abode had eight True Disciples, three of whom—including Senior Brother Feng Wuyu—originated from the Nine Domains of the lower realm.  

Currently, the affairs of the Chiming Taihao Heavenly Abode were managed in rotation by these eight True Disciples at the Unity Realm.  

Of course, since these True Disciples rarely stayed in the Heavenly Abode for long, the day-to-day matters were handled by the registered Dharma Form Realm disciples beneath them.  

Moreover, the number of Dharma Form Realm disciples from the Nine Domains lineage was far fewer than those from the Celestial Realm lineage.  

As a result, within the Chiming Taihao Heavenly Abode, disciples from the Nine Domains lineage were somewhat at a disadvantage.  

A similar situation existed in other Heavenly Abodes—some were dominated by the Nine Domains lineage, others by the Celestial Realm lineage.  

But overall, the Celestial Realm lineage held the greater advantage.  

Their lively discussion lasted nine days before the three senior brothers finally took their leave.  

Zhang Jing courteously escorted them to the exit of his immortal island.  

Just before departing, the golden-robed Xuan Yuan turned back and advised with a smile,  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, I noticed your immortal island seems a bit desolate. When you have time, consider visiting Evergreen Immortal City in the Radiant Immortal World to purchase some natural immortal spirits to tend to your island. A well-maintained island can produce a steady stream of resources, which can be exchanged for a considerable amount of fortune."  

"Thank you for the advice, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.  

As the four conversed, a towering thousand-zhang giant suddenly appeared outside Zhang Jing's immortal island.  

The giant had three halos of spiritual light behind his head, his body wreathed in purple mist. With each step, faint traces of chaos seemed to emerge, while the illusory forms of the Four Symbols rotated around him, roaring incessantly.  

Four-colored immortal light intertwined, exuding an overwhelming aura of suppression.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, welcome to the Chiming Taihao Heavenly Abode! I’ve come to offer my congratulations. Apologies for the sudden intrusion—I hope you don’t mind!"  

A mighty Daoist voice, carrying terrifying divine intent, boomed in Zhang Jing's ears like thunder.  

In the next instant, Xuan Yuan stepped forward.  

A three-legged Golden Crow, its back bearing nine blazing suns, materialized out of thin air.  

With a piercing cry, the Golden Crow unleashed vast, majestic immortal light that instantly dispersed the divine intent permeating the island.  

"Qing Fang! Junior Brother Zhang Jing has just arrived in the Celestial Realm and is only at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Don’t push things too far!" Xuan Yuan's thunderous voice echoed through the void.  

"Hahaha, we’re just here to welcome Junior Brother Zhang Jing. How is that going too far? Xuan Yuan, you’re far too serious—that’s not good for your longevity," the giant rumbled.  

With those words, his colossal figure vanished without a trace.
