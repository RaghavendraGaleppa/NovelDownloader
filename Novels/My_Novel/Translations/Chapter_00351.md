Chapter 351: Shijie Loses an Arm, Nianjun Suspects, and Discovers the Truth About Li Xian—Could He Be the White-Faced Archer?

By: Duōqíng Shíliu

Gu Nianjun stood by the boat with another man. He had an elegant, scholarly air, a handsome face, and wore a white robe. Holding a jade fan, he was none other than the all-around talent, "Zhou Shijie."

Li Xian saw the look of disgust on Gu Nianjun's face and deduced she was scorning him for being a "Flower Thief." He thought to himself, *I only need to be true to myself. What you lot think of me has nothing to do with me.*

He had already broken out of the encirclement, his escape route was clear, and he was confident he could flee. With a calm and composed air, he cupped his fists and said, "Miss Gu, long time no see. To meet again in such a scene is truly filled with emotion!"

Gu Nianjun furrowed her brow deeply. "I never imagined... you... you actually became a Flower Thief. Aiding the wicked, detestable to the extreme! Your current appearance is truly... truly... repulsive."

Li Xian had always disliked Gu Nianjun's arrogant lecturing. He deliberately laughed and said, "What's so bad about being a Flower Thief? Carefree and unfettered, without restraint. Miss Gu, why don't you become a Flower Thief too?"

Gu Nianjun cursed, "Utter scoundrel! For Xiaofan to have you as a brother is a lifelong stain. I was right to tell him to stay away from you. You are unworthy to be his brother."

Zhou Shijie paused, fixing his gaze on Li Xian and observing him closely. In his heart, he secretly compared them and indeed found they had a three-tenth resemblance. He thought, *No wonder that Li Xiaofan is also so讨厌 (annoying); they come from the same vein, flowing with nothing but filthy blood.* He said in a deep voice, "Nianjun, in my opinion, like brother, like brother. That Li Xiaofan is definitely no good either."

Gu Nianjun pointed at Li Xian and said, "Xiaofan has no such brother. You can insult him, but don't bring Xiaofan into this."

Zhou Shijie said, "Nianjun... I think that Li Xiaofan also has quite a thief-like nature. This is no nonsense." Gu Nianjun gave a faint glance, and Zhou Shijie immediately shut his mouth.

Zhou Shijie changed his tune and advised, "This小子 (fellow) has deep ties with the Flower Cage Sect. I see he is beyond redemption and impossible to talk back. Since we've encountered him on this trip, we absolutely cannot let the tiger return to the mountain."

Gu Nianjun thought, *Zhou Shijie's words do make sense. Back when I met Li Xian in the prefecture city, his moves were ruthless, already showing a sinister nature. At the time, I judged that this person was not worth深交 (deep association). He might affect Xiaofan's future. Meeting him again today, it has indeed come true. If Xiaofan wants to achieve great things in the future, having this Flower Thief brother obstructing him, damaging his reputation and ruining his good name, wouldn't that be...*

She said, "Li Xian, if you have any conscience, think of Xiaofan. You should tie yourself up and surrender now. Accept judgment and wash away your sins."

Li Xian observed his surroundings. He saw the water current subtly carrying him away. During this conversation, the distance was gradually widening, which was beneficial to him. He paid it no mind and said, "Accept judgment? Whose judgment? Is it the laws of the Great Wu Dynasty? But can these laws judge you lot right now? Xiaofan has his own path to walk; why do I need to interfere unnecessarily?"

Gu Nianjun frowned and said, "If we break the law, we should naturally be punished. I am speaking so much to you for Xiaofan's sake."

"You should know that the name 'Flower Thief' is beaten by everyone. Xiaofan has lofty ambitions, yet before he can even start his expedition, his reputation is already damaged. How can he stand firm in the future?"

Li Xian thought, *Although every word of yours is for Xiaofan, every word excludes me. Hmph, do you think I, Li Xian, am so pedantic? With just a few words, you want me to feel guilty and admit defeat?* He sneered and said, "Good, you've reminded me. Xiaofan is my younger brother. In the future, if anyone dares to look down on him or not let him stand firm, I will go and kill them!"

Li Xian sneered, "Speaking of the Great Wu laws, your Gu family should suffer judgment even more. Your Gu family once received imperial favor; there are several surnamed Gu in the court. But your Gu family's loyalty to the dynasty is questionable. Things like 'feigning compliance while opposing' (yángfèngyīnwéi), I'm afraid you've done quite a few. Your crime of treason and disloyalty, compared to my crime of visiting brothels and seeking flowers, I wonder which is greater?"

After the matters in Flying Dragon City were concluded, Wén Cǎishāng was captured and bound. Over those few days, the two were close together. Li Xian had explored her body and found it endlessly enjoyable, reluctant to part. He took the opportunity to read through this "book" and discuss worldly affairs. Li Xian had shallow vision and narrow knowledge, mostly listening to Wén Cǎishāng's eloquent talk. Wén Cǎishāng was knowledgeable and sharp-eyed; looking at things and distinguishing matters, she often got straight to the point. She unintentionally mentioned the "Gu family," her words full of sarcasm. She had never liked the Gu family to begin with, so she was even more impolite.

Gu Nianjun's face turned pale and then white. She wanted to argue, but hearing Li Xian's sharp words, her confidence shrank for a moment, and she actually took half a step back.随后, she said stiffly, "I'm not here to argue with you. I said, for Xiaofan's sake, I am advising you to surrender. To openly and honestly clear your sins according to the law."

Zhou Shijie immediately said, "This person's crimes are heinous. If we follow the law, he should be beheaded to show the public."

Li Xian said, "What if I don't?" Gu Nianjun said, "You have no other path. Your sins are not cleared, your evil deeds are piled high. It's fine if you harm yourself, but you're also dragging Xiaofan down. I absolutely cannot allow this."

Li Xian asked, "What are you going to do?" Gu Nianjun said, "I will capture you myself."

Zhou Shijie thought, *That day in the tomb, although I was defeated in an instant, it was because I couldn't use my martial arts. Now there are no external interferences, how could I not defeat him? Hmph, those women from the sword sect must have been deluded, saying he could fight a Third Realm martial artist. Last time we met, apart from his tricky archery, where could he surpass me? With such a good opportunity, how can I not regain my confidence and pay back all the frustration?* He shouted loudly, "Little Flower Thief, I will handle this. Nianjun, I'll be back soon! Watch how I capture this小子!"

He leaped up, stepping on the great waves, and slapped his palm towards Li Xian. He had long-held resentment and prejudice against Li Xian. His narrow mind and lingering frustration ran deep. His pride was deeply affected. For a moment, he only saw past glory and failed to perceive the current situation.

His talent was not bad, but due to his nature, he was gradually losing his edge and becoming mediocre. He used the "Treading Waves Technique" to attack; where his palm wind blew, the waves surged violently. The surrounding martial artists cheered in unison, praising endlessly.

Zhou Shijie threw one palm, immediately pulled his arm back, and added several more palms in mid-air. The palm forces piled up, and the surging waves rushed forth. These few moves contained the "Treading Waves Technique," "Wild Wave Palm," and "Trembling Strength Fist." He had used all the skills he had learned in his lifetime and was secretly proud and complacent.

Seeing the towering waves sweeping over, Li Xian used the "Blue Waves Soaring the Sky" move from the "Blue Silk Palm." With a single palm strike in mid-air, his inner Qi rolled up the water waves and collided with the enemy's waves in an instant.

The two waves touched, transmitting a "rumbling" shock, the water waves surging and shaking the heavens. Within the waves, inner Qi clashed, along with various martial principles and evolutions. The splashing water droplets and spray all contained considerable killing power.

Zhou Shijie's nature was flighty and eager for quick success. His martial arts evolution was flashy, his inner Qi loose. Oppressing wandering martial artists was more than enough. Li Xian believed in heavenly rewards for diligence, taking one step at a time, accumulating daily cultivation. His martial arts evolution was ingeniously crafted, perfect and complete, flawless, his inner Qi pure and condensed, surging and mighty. The two moves clashed; although Zhou Shijie used several moves in succession and gave his all, he was no match for Li Xian's single palm. Although it seemed like the waves were evenly matched, in reality, Zhou Shijie suffered a crushing defeat!

Li Xian thought, *This Zhou Shijie doesn't know what's good for him. In the tomb, I could have killed him. He provoked me time and again, and I spared his life. Now he's being aggressive again, hmph, then don't blame me for being ruthless.* He stepped forward, his palm Qi surging. The water spray from the collision of the two waves paused in mid-air for a moment, then was all violently pushed towards Zhou Shijie. This move was called "Against the Current." When the martial arts evolution reached its peak, it could make waterfalls flow backward, extremely powerful. It was originally not a move of the "Blue Silk Palm." After Li Xian reached the pinnacle, combining what he had seen and learned: there was a reverse-flowing waterfall at the Dragon Appreciation Banquet in the past. He rode a boat upstream against the current. He integrated this move into the Blue Silk Palm. The move was fierce and powerful, but due to his narrow vision, it was far from perfect.对阵高手, he did not dare to use it easily, fearing to reveal flaws. Just now, he had a strong exchange with Zhou Shijie and knew Zhou Shijie was weak and powerless. So he took the opportunity to use this move. In an instant, countless water droplets shot out like sharp weapons, enough to shred Zhou Shijie into a bloody mess and take his life completely.

Zhou Shijie's expression turned to horror. Just now, when they were clashing head-on, he had already sensed the difference. This小子 was far superior to him from before, his moves evolving endlessly, his inner Qi surging and mighty. At this point, he felt like he was riding a tiger and found it hard to get off. He had to fight with his life, pouring all his inner Qi into it. When it seemed like they were evenly matched, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief. How could he have known that in an instant, he would collapse like a mountain. The moves he was so proud of couldn't withstand a single palm strike.

He had always been proud, showing off his might among his peers. This defeat made his chest ache. Then it turned into terror. The water droplets attacked like sharp knives. He used his jade fan to block. The jade fan had a special material, tough and light, but his skills were limited, his ability shallow, so he couldn't block them all. In a flash, he was already injured. The killing force was far from over; he was already in a panic, completely disorganized, showing the huge gap in strength.

Suddenly, a red whip struck out. The whip was very thin, but it pressed down with the force of a mountain, knocking down a patch of water droplets, temporarily relieving Zhou Shijie's urgent need. However, the power of Li Xian's palm had not yet been fully dissipated. Zhou Shijie had just boasted arrogantly, using all his strength to create waves and strike, but he was no match for a single exchange. The killing move turned into a failure. The water he had just stirred up was all pushed back by Li Xian, turning into water droplets as killing moves. One after another, wave upon wave. A patch was knocked down, and another came, like a waterfall hanging from the sky. To protect oneself completely, one would need to withstand the scouring of the waterfall without getting a single corner of one's clothes wet. Zhou Shijie did not have such ability. The whip moved quickly, forming a whip barrier, wrapping Zhou Shijie inside.

Then came countless "pa pa pa" sounds. The water droplets hit the whip body, the two inner Qis neutralized each other. In the end, the whip was tougher, and the water droplets were turned into white mist. The sound of this exchange was loud, and for a time, water mist filled the air.

Zhou Shijie kept his life, but observing the clash of the two moves firsthand, he realized the difference within. The power of Li Xian's palm was enough to take his small life dozens of times. The depth of his evolution was astonishing to behold. He also saw that the whip technique was not bad, dancing like a dragon or a snake. He looked back and saw that it was Gu Nianjun who had saved him. Instead of being happy, he felt sour, his chest stifled and gloomy. He rarely saw Gu Nianjun reveal her skills; he only thought her martial arts were average, but her scholarship, appearance, and family background were excellent. That's why he pursued her desperately. Seeing this, his inferiority complex deepened instantly.

He felt hopeless: *Ah! Nianjun is so powerful, I am inferior to her in martial arts, and also inferior to her in literature. I... I am inferior in every way. What face do I have to pursue her?*

For a time, he was caught between the two forces, his life not in his own hands, with nowhere to place himself. His desperate thoughts ultimately led to despair. Gu Nianjun had good intentions to save him, and he didn't dare to blame her. He attributed all his old and new hatred to Li Xian. He thought, *I, Zhou Shijie, a great man, how can I allow him to humiliate me like this? Even if I have to risk my life, I won't be so pathetic.*

Holding his jade fan, his spirit surged, and he actually wanted to rush out of the whip barrier. Gu Nianjun was startled, not knowing why Zhou Shijie suddenly went mad. But she knew that if she didn't retract her move, the red whip would seriously injure Zhou Shijie. She gritted her silver teeth and had to withdraw her strength and retract her move. Zhou Shijie roared, "Evil thief, take my life!" He held his fan to defend and broke free from the protection. He attacked Li Xian desperately.

Dense water droplets shot towards him. Zhou Shijie had suffered repeated defeats recently and was particularly sensitive. He defended against the water droplets like a madman, wanting to vent his frustration and anger. He was eager for quick success, his heart filled with anger, and his martial arts evolution was actually lacking, with countless flaws.

After resisting for a while, his entire body was already covered in hundreds of injuries. Fortunately, Gu Nianjun had just blocked eight-tenths of the power. The force of the "Blue Silk Palm" had been mostly dissipated. Zhou Shijie's reckless actions did not endanger his life. However, his right arm was not spared. It was affected by the palm Qi, the flesh and blood on his arm fell away, the meridians, bones, and blood vessels were all destroyed, and the white bones were exposed.

Zhou Shijie let out a miserable scream and flew backward. Gu Nianjun waved her red whip, wrapped it around Zhou Shijie's waist, and pulled him back onto the boat. Zhou Shijie endured the intense pain, looking at his miserable right hand. The thought of being disabled in the future was hard for him to accept. "Ah!" he fainted.

Gu Nianjun transmitted her inner Qi to him, helping him circulate his blood and Qi. He soon woke up again. Zhou Shijie wailed, "My right hand... Nianjun... is my right hand废 (useless)?" Gu Nianjun's expression was unsightly. Seeing Zhou Shijie covered in blood, his appearance wretched, and the injury to his arm unbearable to look at. He was once elegant and graceful, but now so pathetic. Although she didn't understand why Zhou Shijie suddenly went mad just now, his crusade against the Flower Thief was, after all, correct and selfless. It was not good to blame him now. She said in a deep voice, "This hand, it won't be easy to keep for the time being."

Zhou Shijie said resentfully, "Nianjun, avenge me, avenge me. This thief is vicious and ruthless, he... he废ed my right hand."

Li Xian said loudly, "You rushed up yourself, why blame me? That woman kindly protected you, but your inferiority complex acted up, and you wanted to show off. You ended up with a disabled hand, adding nothing but laughter. I'm afraid the beauty won't be swayed, and the heroes will also despise you in their hearts. The all-around talent, the noble young master, is now a half-crippled, half-broken big废物 (waste)." His eyesight was extremely strong. He had observed the changes in Zhou Shijie's expression several times: resentment, anger, inferiority... He guessed randomly again and deliberately provoked him.

Zhou Shijie's face turned deathly pale. Every word pierced his heart. He felt a pain in his chest and a sweet taste in his throat. He spat out a large mouthful of blood. He recalled recent events:

Zhou Shijie and Gu Nianjun arrived at Flying Dragon City, paying a visit to Fú Hàorán and Li Xiaofan, master and disciple. At first, they got to know the people from the sword sect. Young talents socializing, it was indeed extremely pleasant.

Later, he gradually felt that his martial arts were slightly weaker and felt a sense of inferiority. But with luck on his side, he still had many admirers. Later, Gu Nianjun went missing, and Zhou Shijie followed the sword sect into the tomb to find her.

The women of the sword sect gathered and exposed Hè Wèntiān's identity. Zhou Shijie showed several ugly sides, his reputation plummeted, his prestige was gone, and his elegance was lost. The women scolded Zhou Shijie repeatedly and were very rude. Wáng Dézhòng, Huá Wǔ, Yuè Kāi, and other former friends all silently distanced themselves.

Zhou Shijie wanted to leave several times. But to survive, he had to endure. The elders of the sword sect saw this and thought, *Although this Zhou Shijie cannot be called a hero, he looked decent at first glance, but upon closer inspection, he is extremely ordinary. But after all, he followed us into the tomb to rescue the women. His original intention was not bad. If we force him away and he dies here, it would be the sword sect's fault.*

Xiāo Wànjiàn, Hú Yuèyuè, Duàn Yīxīn, and other leading elders, although they had trusted Hè Wèntiān because of him, found it hard to shirk all responsibility. They went closer to discuss and secretly sent small messages, telling the many disciples of the sword sect not to be disrespectful to Zhou Shijie.

The female disciples felt indignant but obeyed. Zhou Shijie could breathe a little easier and followed the sword sect to save his life. But along the way, the cold glances hurt his heart. Later, Hè Wèntiān showed signs of defeat.

Gu Nianjun captured Hè Wèntiān and met up. Zhou Shijie immediately ran over and said joyfully, "Nianjun, you're safe!" Gu Nianjun saw Zhou Shijie there, guessing he was looking for her, and smiled, "Naturally safe, thank you for your concern."

Zhou Shijie said, "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare. It's good that you're back, it's good that you're back." He thought, *The matters in the tomb were indeed not good-looking. If Nianjun finds out about these things, even she will despise me. What should I do? I absolutely cannot let her know.*

So he always followed Gu Nianjun closely. The sword sect elders had already instructed them not to offend Zhou Shijie with their words. The sword sect disciples didn't like Zhou Shijie, so naturally they didn't like Gu Nianjun either. They rarely sought out the two to talk. The name "Li Xian" was like a needle, pricking both the sword sect and Zhou Shijie. It was better not to mention his merits or his harm at all.

Gu Nianjun wanted to inquire clearly about the matter, but Zhou Shijie was always following her. Even if the sword sect disciples spoke to her, they were mindful of the elders' instructions, and their words were evasive and tactful. They would slip away after a few sentences. Gu Nianjun didn't察觉 (detect) their meaning and didn't understand the whole process of the matter. Together with Zhou Shijie's obstruction, it was even harder to see the full picture.

Later, they returned to the city. The Five Mountains Sword Alliance handled things secretly and absolutely did not speak more of the tomb matters.

The encirclement of Flower Thieves in Flying Dragon City, how the women were rescued, the siege of Wén Cǎishāng, Li Xian fighting the sword sect... Gu Nianjun knew nothing about it all. She visited the sword sect several times, wanting to ask about related matters, but was quickly shown the door, hoping she wouldn't make a fuss or leak the news.

Zhou Shijie suggested, "Nianjun, this matter involves the sword sect's scandal. They, the Five Sword Alliance, actually lost the women. It's extremely ridiculous. I know about these things too. If you want to know, just ask me. Why go and揭 their伤疤 (pick at their scars)?"

"We've been in Flying Dragon City for a long time. Why don't we leave early? I'll tell you slowly on the way."

Gu Nianjun thought it made sense and stopped inquiring about matters. But there was one thing she couldn't let go of. She said, "But we still have to wait a bit." She thought, *I need to ask that madam again, see if she knows the identity of that... that young master. The martial world is vast. If there's no news at all, then... it will really be hard to see him again.*

So she went to visit the Blue Fragrance Pavilion. Zhou Shijie had witnessed the events in Flying Dragon City. After a little deduction, he knew that the "White-Faced Red Bow" was Li Xian. He didn't dare to tell Gu Nianjun about this. Seeing Gu Nianjun visit the Blue Fragrance Pavilion with no results, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

But seeing that Gu Nianjun had no intention of leaving, Zhou Shijie thought, *If we stay in Flying Dragon City any longer, we'll inevitably come into contact with the sword sect disciples or bump into Wén Cǎishāng or Li Xian. The matters of the tomb will surely be known to Nianjun. I need to find a way to lead Nianjun away.*

After thinking it over, he suddenly saw "Ān Wěichéng" imprisoned in a jail. It turned out that on the day of the incident, Ān Wěichéng had tried to steal a chicken but ended up losing the rice, and was immediately captured afterwards.

Zhou Shijie had a sudden idea: *That Li Xian is a Flower Thief. If we catch some Flower Thieves and just interrogate them about Li Xian's evil deeds, it will surely make Nianjun despise this person. We can also use catching Flower Thieves as an excuse to make Nianjun leave Flying Dragon City.*

So he invited Gu Nianjun to catch Flower Thieves. Gu Nianjun said, "The Flower Thieves in the world are endless. We should indeed catch them, but there's no need to be in such a hurry." She was still paying attention to the Blue Fragrance Pavilion, hoping to meet him again.

Zhou Shijie knew Gu Nianjun's heart was on the White-Faced Red Bow, and he knew even more that this person was Li Xian. He试探 (probed) and said, "Nianjun, this time to catch Flower Thieves, many righteous martial artists have already joined. Do you remember the divine archer we met before?"

Gu Nianjun was indeed intrigued and said, "Oh? Tell me quickly." Zhou Shijie felt deeply disappointed but endured the frustration and said, "He has also joined. But he was a step ahead of us. The Flower Thieves are fleeing in all directions. If we go to catch Flower Thieves, we might happen to meet him and cooperate to punish the traitors!"

Gu Nianjun's thoughts drifted. The elegance of his archery in the past seemed to晃荡 (sway) before her eyes. Her eyes were filled with迷离 (dazed) admiration. She thought, *If we could cooperate again, it would really... be excellent. I haven't seen him shoot for a long time. That kind of elegance... is hard to find elsewhere.* She changed her tune and said, "Good! We'll catch Flower Thieves!"

She gathered the martial artists in the city and got Ān Wěichéng. She tried to capture the scattered Flower Thieves. The Flower Thieves were scattered everywhere, committing numerous evil deeds. Her efforts to capture them quickly showed results.

Along the way, she heard the notoriety of "Flower Thief Li Xian" and secretly wondered: *Could it be a同名同姓 (same name and surname)?* Zhou Shijie added fuel to the fire from the side,编纂 (fabricating) the events of Flying Dragon City and telling her.

Gu Nianjun was indeed disgusted. Later, she set up this trap, luring the Flower Thieves into a snare. She didn't expect to bump into Li Xian, and there was no doubt about it. Her prejudice was already deep.

Seeing Li Xian again, Zhou Shijie's jealousy and hatred filled his chest, and his reason was hard to maintain. Under the pretext of eliminating harm, he actually wanted to vent his personal grudge. But Li Xian's wings were gradually growing stronger. With a single palm, he shattered Zhou Shijie's body and mind.

With a few words, he exposed his true feelings. Zhou Shijie was all said correctly. The experiences of the past few months had severely damaged his spirit. His heart's meridian was almost broken.

Gu Nianjun saw how wretched Zhou Shijie was, and coupled with Li Xian's unpleasant words, she当场 (on the spot) cursed, "You Flower Thief, you still dare to talk big. You are truly beyond redemption. Even if Zhou Shijie is not as strong, he is still thousands of times better than you!"

She felt extreme disgust in her heart and swung her red whip. She struck at Li Xian's plank boat. She was angry and didn't hold back. Li Xian knew the boat was important. He pressed down hard with both feet. The boat flipped over, dodging the whip strike.

Gu Nianjun snorted coldly. The moment the whip missed, the whip body shook, and she used the "Condensing Water Immortal Sound." She transmitted the immortal sound to the whip body. This immortal sound could make the water sticky. She struck the water with her whip, but after making the water sticky, it clung to the whip body. This made the whip body extend an additional water whip, longer and more unexpected. She took the opportunity to strike again.

The water whip struck from bottom to top. This move was very hard to detect. Li Xian had heavy pupils, a strange eye, but he had already sensed it. He stepped on the edge of the boat, swaying the boat left and right. His chest drum faintly暗 (subtly) rumbled with thunder, but it didn't make a sound. Instead, through the swaying, it was transmitted to the lake water below.

After swaying several times, the lake water actually boiled and churned!

It turned out there was a great secret within. It contained the "Thunder Tremor Finger" move from the "Gang Thunder Finger," and the "Playing Sun Immortal Sound" from the Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword.

The Thunder Tremor Finger aims to rumble thunder in the chest without making a sound, transmitting the thunder's tremor to the fingertips, and then raising the finger to strike, greatly increasing its power! Li Xian made flexible use of this, but instead of striking with his finger, he transmitted the tremor to the lake water through the boat. He also added the wonderful use of the "Playing Sun Immortal Sound."

It made the area under the boat seem to have thunder and fire翻腾 (churning). Boiling and seething. Gu Nianjun's water whip was震得 (shaken) to涣散 (disperse) and was煮得 (boiled) to沸腾 (boil). Naturally, its power was greatly reduced and it was hard to form again.

At this time, his boat was already far away. Li Xian laughed, "Hahaha, it seems you all can't do anything to me. Let's part for now. If fate allows, we'll meet again!" He plunged the Sinking River Sword into the water and stirred it around. The boat's speed became even more terrifyingly fast. Even if traveling by boat, it would be hard to catch up. If they used lightness skill on the water, they might fear for their lives. For a time, they hesitated. They were anxious in vain, but truly could do nothing to him.

A wandering martial artist said, "This小子 is extremely arrogant. Are we really going to let him run away like this?"

Gu Nianjun said coldly, "Hmph, let him be arrogant for now. He can't run." She took out a silver bow from the cabin. She gently stroked the bow body and said calmly, "My archery has improved greatly recently. Wait until he travels a few more miles, thinks he is safe, and relaxes his guard. Then I'll take an arrow and shoot him. I can definitely capture him alive."

The martial artist praised, "Miss Gu has a good plan." Gu Nianjun said, "It's not my plan. This move of releasing the prey to return to the mountain was taught to me by a... a young master." Her expression忽 (suddenly) changed.

Zhou Shijie's expression changed greatly upon hearing this. He exclaimed, his eyes trembling, wanting to speak but stopping.

Gu Nianjun was extremely confident. Her archery was originally strong. After receiving guidance, she was a leader among her peers. She was very confident in winning with her archery. Seeing the time was ripe, she stepped lightly with her feet, flew up with lightness skill, and drew her bow in mid-air to shoot.

Li Xian sneered in his heart: *You haven't even mastered it, and you dare to shoot me?* He hooked a common bow and arrow with his toe. It was taken during the chaotic battle just now. He quickly nocked the arrow and shot.

Three "da da da" sounds, and he easily shot Gu Nianjun down. Gu Nianjun was startled, vaguely sensing familiarity. She thought: *Yes, this小子's archery was originally not bad; he could shoot down these three arrows. I was careless just now.*

She recalled what Li Xian had taught her. In mid-air, she nocked another arrow and shot. She shot three more arrows in a row, each arrow stronger than the last. The arrows shot out with a惊天 (startling heaven) force, advancing without fear.

Li Xian casually shot again, and each arrow was knocked down exactly. Gu Nianjun was惊疑 (suspicious and startled) and speechless. She gathered her strength and was about to nock the bow and pull the string again when she suddenly felt the world had slowed down. This feeling was extremely mysterious.

福至心灵 (Fortune reached the mind), a chance encounter. She felt her heart and mind flow wildly through her fingers to the arrow body, gathering at the arrowhead. The arrowhead seemed to shine with a bright light, condensed by her spirit. Others couldn't see the light, but they could feel it. This arrow was filled with spirit.

Gu Nianjun thought: *Ah! So this is the spirit arrow. This is what it feels like to shoot an arrow. Good... so powerful!* She personally experienced the various mysteries. She knew even more that such an arrow was hard to come by. The timing, the state of mind, the situation—all were indispensable. Or perhaps, it was the strongest arrow she could shoot in her lifetime.

Even if her cultivation accumulated and her martial arts became stronger in the future... if she couldn't encounter this moment's opportunity, this state of mind, this everything, she would never be able to shoot such an arrow again. She released the string and shot. The spirit carried the arrow, faster and stronger. It逼 (pressed) towards the enemy, with no path to dodge!

Gu Nianjun said, not content, "With such an arrow, how can the enemy defend!可惜 (unfortunately), that arrow, I will never be able to experience it again..."

Suddenly, her eyes凝 (focused). The spirit arrow suddenly suffered a great setback, and the arrow body trembled slightly. She looked far into the distance and saw Li Xian drawing his bow again. He hadn't shot yet, but his spirit was sharp and radiating in all directions.

She felt her whole body tense and watched solemnly. She saw Li Xian release the string and shoot. It was also a spirit arrow, and the spirit was even thicker, the sharpness even greater. She vaguely felt she had seen it somewhere before.

Li Xian shot after her, piercing through Gu Nianjun's spirit, crossing an极远 (extremely far) distance, and shot into the side of Gu Nianjun's foot. With a rumble, it pierced through the plank boat, and the water spray splashed several zhang high. Gu Nianjun was失魂落魄 (lost her soul). "This... how is this possible? How is possible? He... he... he... how could he also know this arrow?"

The posture of that arrow lingered in her mind, and her head suddenly went blank. Her expression was at a complete loss.
