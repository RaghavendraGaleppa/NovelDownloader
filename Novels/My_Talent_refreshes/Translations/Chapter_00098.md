# Chapter 98: Unwithered Bone Perfection, Startling Thunder Step

"After just one body tempering session with the Earth Spirit Spring Water, I can increase my proficiency by 3 points!"

Chu Ning looked at the changing proficiency of his Unwithered Bone technique with pleasant surprise, silently calculating in his mind.

There were a total of 18 Blood-Glow Grasses. He had just given one to Little White Spirit and used one himself, leaving 16. If this effect could be maintained, half a month of continuous sessions would increase his Unwithered Bone proficiency by 48 points, pushing it beyond 300. If his prediction was correct, Unwithered Bone would face a bottleneck after reaching 300. In just over ten days, he could then consume the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and aim for Unwithered Bone perfection.

A faint smile appeared on Chu Ning's face.

At that moment, a cold breeze swept through, bringing a slight chill below his waist. Oh, he had forgotten to put his clothes on.

Chu Ning dressed himself, then circled the cave, ensuring nothing was left behind before finally departing. He called Little White Spirit, then leaped onto his Wind Chasing Shuttle and flew away. Coming here, he had used Wind Manipulation Art, which took about half an hour. Now, with the faster Wind Chasing Shuttle, it only took him a quarter of an hour to return to the spiritual field.

He changed back to his original appearance before heading into the market. His first stop was Gu Xiaoqing’s shop.

“Senior Sister Gu, please get me a bottle of Fasting Pills,” Chu Ning said, getting straight to the point upon arriving at her shop. He planned to accelerate the cultivation of Purple Crystal Bamboo in the spiritual field and temper his body with Earth Spirit Spring Water daily. He didn’t want the hassle of commuting back and forth every day, so he decided to stock up on Fasting Pills. It would be much more convenient when he didn't return to the market.

Gu Xiaoqing glanced at Chu Ning, reaching for the pills, then her clear eyes fixed on him. "Junior Brother Chu, you've reached the fifth layer of Qi Condensation?"

The fifth layer of Qi Condensation was the cultivation level Chu Ning intentionally displayed. Revealing his progress from the fourth to the fifth layer of Qi Condensation in just a few months was a calculated move. During the recent beast tide, Chu Ning had sold a large number of talismans, earning considerable spirit stones and establishing his talisman shop's reputation. Consequently, his talisman shop had enjoyed good business over the past two months. Before him, Yanji Market only had one low-grade mid-tier talisman master at Wind Gorge Valley's talisman shop, and that master, Lai Weiquan, was known for his poor attitude. Now, Chu Ning's talismans were not only of better quality but also came with better service. Naturally, those buying talismans were more willing to purchase from Chu Ning.

Aside from a few family cultivators affiliated with Wind Gorge Valley who preferred buying from Lai Weiquan, other cultivation families and rogue cultivators mostly came to Chu Ning for talismans. Some families even secretly bought talismans from Chu Ning despite their affiliations. Thus, the few cultivators from Qingxi Sect were aware of Chu Ning’s significant income from spirit stones over these months. In such circumstances, it was perfectly logical for Chu Ning to use his spirit stones to improve his cultivation and quickly advance his realm. Chu Ning knew that if he appeared to hoard spirit stones, it would only invite envy. He wasn't even sure if Lin Changqing or Du Han would covet his wealth.

During this period, Chu Ning not only bought pills from Gu Xiaoqing but also actively purchased Gray Spirit Rabbits, Spirit Chickens, and other spirit beasts for consumption from various cultivation families. He also bought a magical artifact through Lin Changqing from the sect, displaying an image of someone fully dedicated to enhancing his strength. This way, while everyone knew his talisman shop had earned some spirit stones, they would also assume he hadn't accumulated too many. As for his high success rate in talisman crafting, he naturally wouldn't disclose that.

At this moment, hearing Gu Xiaoqing's question, he replied with a hint of joy on his face, "Thanks to Senior Sister Gu's Qi Gathering Pills, and recently consuming spirit beasts for replenishment, my cultivation indeed progressed much faster."

Gu Xiaoqing nodded, then frowned slightly and pressed, "Junior Brother Chu, I remember you bought three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills two months ago. Have you finished them all?"

Chu Ning, of course, wouldn't tell the truth. He immediately waved his hand and replied, "No, there's still quite a bit left."

"Don't consume them too frequently," Gu Xiaoqing warned. "Even if you follow my advice of taking one every three days, you should still pause after a period. After all, a large accumulation of pill toxins might not be completely dissolved. Moreover, relying solely on pills for advancement can lead to an unstable foundation."

Although none of these were issues for Chu Ning, he was still grateful for Senior Sister Gu's gentle and repeated reminders. So, he sincerely expressed his gratitude. "Thank you for the reminder, Senior Sister. After I finish these, I don't plan on taking any more. I plan to spend more time in the spiritual field cultivating Golden Essence Fruits, so I'm buying Fasting Pills for convenience."

Hearing Chu Ning's words, Gu Xiaoqing nodded, then took a bottle of Fasting Pills and handed it to him.

Chu Ning had initially considered showing Gu Xiaoqing the Spirit Nourishing Pills, but on second thought, he decided against it. The method he acquired them was simply not something he could reveal to outsiders. Even though his interactions with Gu Xiaoqing had led him to trust her completely, he still couldn't be careless.

Over the next few days, Chu Ning's routine remained unchanged: farming, talisman crafting, and cultivation. The only difference was that he spent an hour each day in the cave, using the Earth Spirit Spring Water and Blood-Glow Grass for body tempering. And his proficiency in the Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art visibly soared with each session.

In the blink of an eye, ten days passed.

When Chu Ning arrived at the spiritual field early one morning, he smiled as he saw the Purple Crystal Bamboos, now completely purple. With his and Little White Spirit's continuous催熟 (accelerated growth), the Purple Crystal Bamboos had reached the standard for making talisman paper. This entire process took approximately half the time of the originally planned growth cycle for Purple Crystal Bamboos.

Since that was the case, Chu Ning had no reason to wait. With a casual flick of his wrist, he cast a Blade Edge Art, directly cutting down several Purple Crystal Bamboos.

"Ying!"

Just then, a squeak came from beside him. It was Little White Spirit, its two eyes fixed intently on him.

"Want to eat!"

Receiving Little White Spirit's spiritual message, Chu Ning nodded lightly. He used Object Manipulation Art to directly toss a newly cut Purple Crystal Bamboo in front of it. Little White Spirit immediately began munching happily.

"Little White, aren't you a vegetarian?" Chu Ning uttered a remark that Little White Spirit probably didn't understand. He had noticed recently that Little White Spirit only ate spiritual plants and never touched meat. For instance, the spirit chickens and gray spirit rabbits Chu Ning bought daily, Little White Spirit wouldn't eat them. It only ate spirit rice.

Despite his musings, Chu Ning's hands kept moving, continuously cutting down Purple Crystal Bamboos. For him, now at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation, harvesting these spiritual plants was vastly different from when he was at the third or fourth layer. In less than half an hour, all the Purple Crystal Bamboos were harvested by Chu Ning. During this time, Little White Spirit had stubbornly munched on three full bamboos. Chu Ning couldn't quite figure out how such a small creature managed to consume so much bamboo.

He flew back to the market using Wind Manipulation Art and immediately began making talisman paper. The process of making talisman paper from Purple Crystal Bamboo was largely similar to that of Ink Spirit Bamboo, but Purple Crystal Bamboo yielded more pulp and had fewer impurities. Thus, the same amount of bamboo could produce a significantly greater quantity of high-quality talisman paper.

Having already gone through two seasons of production, Chu Ning was quite familiar with the entire process. Furthermore, both his magical power and spiritual sense had improved considerably, so the talisman paper production was naturally much faster. In just five days, Chu Ning had converted all the Purple Crystal Bamboos into talisman paper.

With nearly 50,000 sheets of talisman paper in his storage bag, Chu Ning had no immediate plans to sell them. A year ago, he would have racked his brains to sell his talisman paper for spirit stones. But now, even if these talisman papers could fetch nearly 1,000 spirit stones, Chu Ning still chose to keep them. After all, crafting talismans himself consumed a lot of paper, and he didn't want to fail in crafting due to poor quality talisman paper as before.

After finishing all the talisman paper, Chu Ning returned to his desk. He wanted to see if he could truly craft low-grade high-tier talismans. Chu Ning still chose to start with the Blazing Flame Talisman. Having practiced with the inferior quality talisman papers before, Chu Ning was very familiar with the talisman script of this charm. He picked up his brush, injected spiritual power, dipped it in ink, and, with the control of his spiritual sense, began drawing on the talisman paper.

As Chu Ning completed the entire talisman script in one smooth motion, a crimson light flashed the next moment. All the light then converged back into the talisman script. This time, no accidents occurred. A complete Blazing Flame Talisman, radiating spiritual power, lay quietly on the table.

"As expected, it was the talisman paper's problem, not mine." Chu Ning lightly held the talisman paper, a slight smirk playing on his lips. With the Talisman Source Spirit Body, even low-grade high-tier talismans were nothing.

So, what was he waiting for? Time to craft talismans. After practicing the Blazing Flame Talisman for a while, Chu Ning moved on to the Cloud Soaring Talisman and the Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman. After crafting five of each type, Chu Ning stopped. With a thought, the talisman ring appeared on his palm. He had already witnessed the power of low-grade high-tier talismans before; the Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman's defense had directly blocked a full-strength attack from a Qi Condensation seventh-layer cultivator. Now that he could craft low-grade high-tier talismans himself, he naturally had to replace the talismans in his talisman ring.

Going to the backyard, he activated and used up all his Vajra Talismans, Yin Lightning Talismans, and Earth Evasion Talismans. Chu Ning glanced at the two Geng Metal Sword Talismans and chose to keep one. The Geng Metal Sword Talisman's destructive power was still considerable, so it was worth keeping one. After all, talismans of different attributes had different uses.

A quarter of an hour later, Chu Ning in his room took out a Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman. He moved the talisman towards the talisman ring on his palm. The next moment, the talisman script transformed into light and flashed into the ring, integrating into the talisman ring on his palm.

"I can really use the low-grade high-tier talismans I make myself!" Chu Ning muttered softly to himself, then casually took out two more Blazing Flame Talismans and one Cloud Soaring Talisman. The three talismans were similarly integrated into the talisman ring. At this moment, Chu Ning's palm shimmered with various colors, unlike before. Then, at Chu Ning's thought, they disappeared once again.

"This means I have several low-grade high-tier spells at my disposal," Chu Ning said, a smile on his face. Then, he picked up his talisman brush once more. Having tasted the joy of crafting low-grade high-tier talismans, Chu Ning began continuously practicing with the three types of talismans. This served to both increase his talisman crafting success rate and to practice his Spirit Refining Art. Moreover, the market day was in two days, and he expected his newly introduced low-grade high-tier talismans to sell well. If they sold well and attracted attention from others in the sect, Chu Ning planned to claim that the talismans came from the sect. After all, the Spirit Talisman Pavilion regularly sent out talisman ink, paper, and similar items. Saying so, no one would delve too deeply.

Chu Ning's worries completely vanished by the afternoon of the next day. Along with them, his joy of success also disappeared.

"What's wrong with the people in Yanji Market? Low-grade high-tier talismans, items so rare here, and they're not buying?" Chu Ning looked at the pile of low-grade high-tier talismans in his hand, unable to stop complaining inwardly. Because it was market day, Chu Ning specifically promoted the low-grade high-tier talismans to those who came to buy. What was frustrating was that in an entire day, Chu Ning only managed to sell one low-grade high-tier talisman.

"The price is only slightly higher. But if they can't even afford a low-grade high-tier talisman for twenty spirit stones, it seems the income level around Yanji Market is indeed a bit low." Chu Ning sighed helplessly, then had no choice but to put these talismans into his storage bag. It seemed selling the low-grade high-tier talismans he had enthusiastically crafted wouldn't be an easy task. He had previously thought that with low-grade high-tier talismans, he could accumulate a lot more spirit stones. Now it seemed that wasn't the case.

Looking at the low-grade talismans in his hand, Chu Ning's brows furrowed slightly. These talismans either had to be returned to the sect for recycling, or...

"Wind Gorge Market." At this moment, a thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind.

Wind Gorge Market was a large market. If he took these talismans to Cloud Sea Pavilion, he figured such a large store could certainly buy them all back. The price, however, would definitely not be as high as selling them individually. But if he sold them in large quantities, the speed of earning spirit stones would certainly be faster than selling them one by one. If he accumulated more talismans, one big sale could truly sustain him for three years. The only trouble was that Wind Gorge Market wasn't particularly close. However, he did have the Wind Chasing Shuttle, so going there should be quick.

"Once I've stockpiled more low-grade high-tier talismans, I can consider making a trip to Wind Gorge Market," Chu Ning decided inwardly.

Fortunately, for Chu Ning, this matter was not urgent. He didn't have many places where he urgently needed to spend spirit stones, and he had accumulated quite a bit from selling talismans over the past few months. Right now, his first priority was to complete the final Earth Spirit Spring Water body tempering!

The next day, Chu Ning once again arrived in the cave. When he looked at his cultivation progress, his eyes flickered slightly.

[Azure Wood Evergreen Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Layer (32/2100)]
[Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Unwithered Bone 299/600]
[Spirit Refining Art, First Layer 376/1000]

In the previous 15 days, Chu Ning had used the Earth Spirit Spring Water combined with Blood-Glow Grass for body tempering daily, increasing his Unwithered Bone proficiency by a full 45 points. At this moment, it had reached 299.

"Now let's see if 300 is indeed the bottleneck." Thinking this, Chu Ning took out the last Blood-Glow Grass from his storage bag and threw it into the Earth Spirit Spring Water. A moment later, the spring water turned blood-red again. Chu Ning directly stepped into it and soaked for another hour.

When the spring water returned from blood-red to normal, the intense heat within Chu Ning's body reached its peak. He immediately got up and began cultivating the Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art. As soon as the burning sensation completely dissipated from his body, he immediately checked his proficiency.

[Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Unwithered Bone 300/600]

The proficiency of Unwithered Bone indeed only increased to 300. Under normal circumstances, this value should have been 302. Just as Chu Ning had expected, similar to when he cultivated the Immortal Skin, once the proficiency reached halfway, further cultivation of Unwithered Bone could not be improved through normal means, not even through Earth Spirit Spring Water tempering. Unwithered Bone was at the critical point of breakthrough, requiring something that could directly break through the bottleneck.

Thinking of this, Chu Ning unhesitatingly took out a Seven-Star Spirit Fruit that had been in his storage bag for quite some time and put it directly into his mouth. A rich spiritual energy immediately dissolved in his mouth and then directly penetrated into his body. The familiar burning sensation appeared in his dantian. With his previous experience, Chu Ning didn't wait. Almost simultaneously with the appearance of the burning sensation, he immediately began cultivating the Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art. He hadn't forgotten that the last time, that burning sensation almost burned his consciousness into a daze.

Sure enough, the next moment, the burning sensation within his body continuously spread from the inside out, making Chu Ning's entire body feel as if it would melt away from the heat wave. Large beads of sweat dripped from Chu Ning's body, and he cultivated the Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art over and over again, without the slightest pause.

Perhaps it was because of his previous experience of breaking through to perfection with Immortal Skin, but at this moment, Chu Ning felt that the intensity of the ordeal seemed a bit better than last time. Then, this burning sensation, just like the previous time, gradually weakened with the cultivation of the Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art. His body also became increasingly transparent. After cultivating like this for a while, Chu Ning gradually noticed that the burning sensation on his body had disappeared. This made him stop in surprise. His body felt as if the medicinal effects of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit had been completely absorbed and transformed. However, he didn't feel the sensation of breaking through Unwithered Bone, unlike when his Immortal Skin reached mastery last time.

In confusion, Chu Ning sank his mind into his thoughts, observing his cultivation progress.

[Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Unwithered Bone 420/600]

"Hmm, this one Seven-Star Spirit Fruit didn't completely break through the bottleneck, it only increased my body tempering proficiency by 120 points?" Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. According to the jade slip's introduction, the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit was effective even for breaking through the bottlenecks of Unbroken Sinew and Undying Soul. Why didn't it even manage to break through Unwithered Bone for him?

"Could it be because I used the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit during the Immortal Skin stage, so its subsequent medicinal effects weakened? Or is it that under the combined effect of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and Earth Spirit Spring Water, my body tempering effect is superior to others, making the bottleneck even harder?" Chu Ning wasn't sure of the reason, so he decided not to dwell on it for now. Since one Seven-Star Spirit Fruit wasn't enough, he would just take another! It's just Seven-Star Spirit Fruit; he had plenty.

Chu Ning immediately took out another Seven-Star Spirit Fruit without a word and consumed it. Then, enduring the burning sensation that felt as if it would scorch his spiritual sense, he continued cultivating the Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art,一遍接一遍 (one cycle after another), until the medicinal power of this Seven-Star Spirit Fruit was completely refined.

Still no breakthrough. Chu Ning checked his proficiency once again.

[Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Unwithered Bone 530/600]

The previous Seven-Star Spirit Fruit had only increased his proficiency by 100 points. "Although I don't know why, it seems the medicinal effects of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit are indeed continuously weakening for me," Chu Ning murmured, raising an eyebrow slightly. "However, one more should be enough to help me break through Unwithered Bone."

As he spoke, he took out the third Seven-Star Spirit Fruit from his storage bag and consumed it. The sensation was almost a replica of the first two Seven-Star Spirit Fruits. The only difference Chu Ning felt was that the burning sensation dissipated faster, which meant he was absorbing the medicinal power more quickly.

The Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art was cultivated cycle after cycle, until at a certain moment…

"Boom!"

That familiar feeling of a bodily restriction being broken open finally appeared once again. And accompanying it was an incredibly clear and comfortable sensation throughout his body, making Chu Ning almost unable to resist letting out a long roar!

Chu Ning immediately checked his proficiency.

[Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Unwithered Bone 600/600]

Unwithered Bone had reached the perfected realm! This meant that, theoretically, Chu Ning could physically withstand ordinary magical attacks from a Qi Condensation ninth-layer cultivator! And as Chu Ning's gaze swept downwards, his eyes brightened even more…
