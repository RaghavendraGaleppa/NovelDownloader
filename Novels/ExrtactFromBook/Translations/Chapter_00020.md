# Chapter 20: The Jade Sky Realm

In the Celestial District's Residence No. 9, Han Yue happily toyed with his newly acquired magical artifact—the Silver Hairpin. He experimented with its spatial storage function, repeatedly storing and retrieving nearby objects—a common pastime for anyone obtaining their first dimensional storage device.

After satisfying his curiosity, Han Yue began organizing his possessions:

- Fourteen mid-grade spirit stones (each equivalent to 100 trade coins)
- A palm-sized piece of second-grade metal
- A white fox pelt
- Several thread-bound books

These four items occupied less than one-tenth of the Silver Hairpin's capacity, reminding Han Yue of his relative poverty. He resolved to earn more resources to fill his storage artifact properly.

Turning his attention to cultivation, Han Yue reviewed his progress after several months of hunting. His internal energy flowed powerfully, further strengthening his physique. The Thunder Nurturing technique's runes in his dantian had grown more cohesive, tightly enveloping the primordial qi provided by the Celestial Lotus.

He had additionally condensed seventy-two new thunder-nurturing runes beyond the initial set of 365, which continuously circulated with his energy flow to enhance his lightning affinity.

Within his sea of consciousness, two divine ability talismans voraciously absorbed his energy, their enhanced aura reflecting Han Yue's mastery progress.

Both primary abilities showed significant progress, with Golden Light Flight nearing breakthrough. Han Yue maintained strict cultivation discipline, ensuring solid foundations by meticulously utilizing every wisp of primordial qi from the Celestial Lotus. When his energy approached capacity, he would embark on hunting expeditions to convert excess energy into ability proficiency and trade coins.

Currently with his talismans only half-charged, Han Yue concluded his cultivation session after two days and turned to his newly acquired Chronicles of Knowledge. This text contained invaluable information about the world he now inhabited.

Through study, Han Yue gained fundamental understanding of the Jade Sky Realm—allegedly created eons ago by the Golden Immortal Jade Sky. This vast world comprised three regions: Outer Domain, Inner Domain, and Oceanic Domain. The Flesh Division Market where he resided lay at the border between Outer and Inner Domains.

Human cultivators primarily inhabited the Inner Domain (considered human territory) and Oceanic Domain, while the Outer Domain functioned as a demonic realm—Han Yue's arrival point.

The Inner Domain contained five continents:
1. **Central Continent** (vastly larger than others)
2. **Four Peripheral Continents**: Sea, Bamboo, Osmanthus, and Reed

Countless cultivation factions existed across these lands, most being minor sects without third-stage cultivators—ephemeral organizations that rose and fell with individual power. Only factions producing third-stage experts could maintain millennium-long legacies, wielding regional influence.

The Flesh Division Market represented one such third-stage power in Osmanthus Continent, maintaining its status despite periodic gaps in third-stage leadership due to its unique organizational structure, frontline position against demonic beasts, and abundant lower-stage cultivators.

Beyond third-stage organizations stood prestigious sects with fourth and fifth-stage grand cultivators—ancient institutions with profound influence. The entire Inner Domain contained merely five fourth-stage and five fifth-stage orthodox sects, plus the unorthodox fifth-stage Demon Seeking Palace—eleven supreme powers governing human affairs in Jade Sky Realm.

In Osmanthus Continent, two fourth-stage sects held dominion:
1. **Beast Taming Sect**: Cultivated bloodline qi, enhanced physiques, and controlled demonic beasts—highly compatible with Flesh Division Market's practices.
2. **Azure Lotus Sword Sect**: Practiced sword cultivation through artifact refinement and qi internalization, representing the weapon cultivation path.

The Chronicles provided more detailed information about these local powers compared to distant sects, but even this overview significantly expanded Han Yue's understanding of the Jade Sky Realm's political and cultivation landscape.
