# Chapter 315: It's Him, It's Him, and Still Him (1/2)

Inside the Xiyangyang Hotpot Restaurant in Ziyang Prefecture.

The latest release of the Hidden Dragon List had caused quite a stir. Two prodigies from a sect within the prefecture had become the talk of the town, the subject of gossip and conversation everywhere.

"Have you heard? From our Ziyang Prefecture's Qingyuan Sect, two figures have emerged..."

"Come on, who in Ziyang Prefecture doesn't know of the 'Wife-Protecting Fighting Soul' and the 'Cold Fairy'?"

"Among the recent Hidden Dragon prodigies, who could possibly have a more dazzling reputation than these two?"

"Tsk, tsk. To slay demons and vanquish fiends in the Southern Frontier at the Third Realm and return unscathed—what peerless elegance! I can't just stand here talking; this calls for a drink!"

"Stuttering Girl, bring us some wine!"

Listening to the customers' chatter, the 'waiter' wearing an ill-fitting, oversized robe and a cloth band over his eyes came running over with a clatter, setting down the wine and a plate of peanuts.

"Stuttering Girl, we ordered wine too. Why didn't we get any peanuts?" a customer at one table asked curiously.

"You... you guys... just said... Young Master Li's... nickname... isn't nice," Jiang Chulong said softly, hugging her tray.

Only those who spoke well of Brother Li got free peanuts.

The customer, feeling singled out, was a bit displeased. His companion quickly pulled him down and gestured toward the second floor. There, a woman in palace-style attire sat with a wide, imposing posture. She narrowed her eyes, tapped the mouth of the gourd in her hand, and tipped it twice. Not a single drop came out. Her beautiful face immediately soured with dissatisfaction.

The customer shivered and quickly sat up straight, looking as obedient as a first-day student at a private school.

"Sister Shang, your wine."

"Why hasn't my precious disciple come back from the Southern Frontier yet?"

Shang Wu sighed, took the wine Jiang Chulong handed her, and smacked her lips. She had long been spoiled by her precious disciple; even the Qingluo Firewine now seemed unpalatable.

"I... I... miss Brother Li too," Jiang Chulong murmured, biting her lips. She glanced at a private room where Aunt Mei and the elders of the Qingyuan Sect were gathered. Then she whispered, "Sister Shang, is it... did Brother Li... send a letter back?"

Shang Wu shook her head, not in denial, but because she didn't know.

So, Jiang Chulong secretly crept to the door to listen in.

It was Aunt Mei's voice:

"Those two kids in the Southern Frontier, I'm afraid they've caused more than just a stir. You all know the situation. With the Empty Mountain Temple gone, chaos is bound to rise."

Qian Bufan, Xue Jing, Han He, and the other peak lords and elders all fell into a heavy silence.

Each elder in charge of a peak was privy to the core secrets of the Qingyuan Sect. Their sect was originally formed by the descendants of the imperial tomb's guardians.

And behind the Disaster Beasts were the remnants of the Great Shang Dynasty.

"Why haven't Li Mo and Ying Bing returned yet?" Qian Bufan pondered aloud.

"Do you think there's a possibility..."

Knowing the boy's personality, Xue Jing couldn't help but say, "...he wants to help the Southern Frontier defend the cities?"

His words brought a heavy silence to the room.

Only the bubbling of the hotpot and the sound of Qian Bufan smacking his lips in thought remained.

This possibility was actually the most plausible one.

"Everyone, make your preparations early. After all, the Imperial Court has abandoned the Southern Pass. Some things are just a matter of time. I plan to take Chulong and leave..."

Before Mei Yun could finish her sentence, the door was pushed open. Jiang Chulong stood there timidly.

Her small face was filled with a delicate fragility, yet beneath the timidity lay a trace of tenacity, like a small white flower pushing its way through a stone slab.

"Aunt Mei... Chulong... Chulong doesn't want to leave."

Mei Yun was taken aback. She had never seen Jiang Chulong like this before, and her expression turned solemn.

"Is it because you can't bear to leave this place? We can find another place and open an identical one."

"It's not the same... This place... is the home Brother Li gave me..."

Jiang Chulong's face paled slightly, her voice trembling softly.

She didn't understand the grand situation of the world, nor did she know what was happening in the Southern Frontier.

She just had to wait here for Brother Li to return.

Just then, Zuoqiu Yang, a former assassin from the Drizzle Building, rushed in with a list in hand, looking frantic.

"Big news! Huge news!"

"What big news?"

"The city's beef and mutton have all been bought out by one person! Not even half a catty left! How are we supposed to run our business? Is this some other hotpot restaurant trying to sabotage us? Damn it!"

"Get lost!"

"???"

...

Yunzhou.

The entire Hengtong Mercantile Guild was bustling with activity. The clerks were like a swarm of ants, constantly moving in and out of the warehouses.

"Not enough manpower? What do I keep you around for?"

"If it's not enough, go to the docks and hire temporary workers. Pay double... no, triple the price!"

Sun Gui, shaking his entire obese frame, was personally running around like a headless chicken. He was a chief steward, after all.

This was no joke.

This order came straight from the God of Wealth himself. If he pulled it off, he might not be stuck in the Yunzhou branch anymore; a transfer to the Imperial Capital headquarters was just around the corner.

"Oh my, what exactly does Young Master Li plan to do with all this?"

"This much grain is enough to raise an army and rally the masses..."

Sun Gui wiped the sweat from his forehead and muttered to himself.

"How is it going?"

A voice suddenly sounded from behind him. Sun Gui turned to see Li Mo standing at the warehouse entrance, a bottle of Three-Treasure Sacred Liquid in his hand—a rare treasure for replenishing Soulforce.

Young Master Li took two big gulps, making Sun Gui's liver tremble.

How could any Soulforce, even at the Observing God Realm, withstand such consumption?

And when had he arrived? As a Inner Manifestation expert, Sun Gui hadn't even sensed his presence...

The ability to travel from the Southern Frontier here in an instant was something he had never even heard of.

"The first batch is almost ready. Meat, grain, fuel oil..." Sun Gui handed over the inventory list and asked, "Young Master Li, forgive my boldness, but the grain prices in Yunzhou have already risen by twenty percent. To avoid affecting the local populace, the next batch will have to be sourced from other places. The cost will be unknown."

"Just source it," Li Mo said, nodding. He used the World Seed to store away the supplies from the warehouses one by one.

Sun Gui was left speechless with astonishment.

A spatial artifact of such magnitude was also something he had never heard of.

The richest man in Yunzhou was having his imagination limited by poverty once again.

...

Southern Frontier, Qingmu City.

The entire city was already in a state of war preparedness, filled with an atmosphere of tension.

Flying Disaster Beasts of the alien clans had already appeared as scouts, patrolling menacingly around Qingmu City.

As the saying goes, the army marches on its stomach. Naturally, the granary of the Qingmu Camp was the most heavily guarded location.

The troops currently guarding it were none other than Qu Sheng's personal guards.

The flickering torchlight cast the silhouette of the Great Commander, who stood with his hands behind his back in front of the granary.

The cold wind howled through the empty granary behind him, producing a mournful and piercing sound.

"Young Master Li said he would make the Qingmu Camp's granary overflow?"

"That's what he said. Then he left," Huang Donglai nodded from not far away.

"..."

Qu Sheng furrowed his brow, his expression complex.

Reason told him this was an impossible task.

First, for eighty thousand men, the daily consumption was at least several hundred thousand catties of grain. The amount of food consumed in a single battle was terrifyingly immense. Even the Imperial Court in the capital would have to think twice, fearing it would drain the nation's resources.

Setting aside whether it could even be done, even if the supplies were gathered, how could they be delivered in time?

For a single person to supply an army with grain over a vast distance in a short period—this sounded like a fantasy.

If it had been anyone other than Li Mo saying this, Qu Sheng wouldn't have even bothered to gather his men to wait.

Time passed.

Qu Sheng began to wonder if perhaps Young Master Li had already decided to leave, but before departing, he couldn't bear to lose face, so he had spouted such grandiose words?

In his understanding, that young hero wasn't the type to do such a thing, but hearts were hard to fathom, especially when life and death were on the line...

Suddenly.

Qu Sheng's expression froze.

The mournful sound of the wind had stopped at some point, as if it were being blocked by something.

He turned his head.

There stood a figure, now seeming a bit more upright. The young man casually swiped his hand, and a spatial rift opened, seemingly from some kind of spatial artifact.

Piled up inside, he could vaguely see mountains of supplies.

"Kept you waiting, Commander Qu."

It's him, it's him, and still him.

"...You... you really... came back?" Qu Sheng asked, his face a mask of disbelief, the realization dawning on him late.

Yes.

How could he possibly leave alone?

The Cold Fairy was still in the city.
