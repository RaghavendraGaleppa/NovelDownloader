# Chapter 281: Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art

Xu Yunfan asked somewhat eagerly, "Master, I wonder which direction I should cultivate in first, and what I should start with? The Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock?"

Bi Yuan said slowly, "You don't need to cultivate those first. I have a technique here called the Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art. It can conceal your aura, hide the fluctuations of your blood and vital energy, and disrupt the characteristics of your martial arts. It can also enhance your vitality and prolong your life. Cultivate this first, allowing yourself to hide your mechanisms and absorb vital energy, concealing all that you have cultivated."

Xu Yunfan was overjoyed upon hearing this. The Dao Sect truly was a wonderful place. He had been wanting to find a technique to conceal his aura and was worrying about how to hide his conspicuous martial arts features after leaving the secret realm.

As Xu Yunfan carefully flipped through the technique handed to him, Bi Yuan rubbed his temples and waved his sleeve.

"Go on. Come find me after you've mastered this art... Don't neglect the Marrow Cleansing Meridian Transformation Art either. That technique is indeed the best in the Marrow Cleansing Realm."

Xu Yunfan agreed readily.

Returning to the courtyard on the mountainside prepared for him, Xu Yunfan had no mind to explore the large mansion. Instead, he calmed his heart and carefully studied the Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on the bluestone platform in the courtyard, his fingertips tracing the uneven ink patterns on the ancient book.

"Lin."

With a soft shout, Xu Yunfan quickly entered the Lin state. The turbulent thoughts in his eyes were instantly smoothed down. His own spirit, emerging from a thick mist, took command of his Sea of Consciousness, sweeping away all distracting thoughts, making his mind sharper than ever before.

The Lin technique was best for guarding the heart, rectifying the will, and keeping the mind clear and bright.

It was most suitable for practicing martial arts and comprehending techniques.

Strictly speaking, the greatest use of the Lin technique lay here, not in combat.

As his mind delved deeper and he continued to study, a line of information suddenly jumped into his vision.

'You are constantly pondering the Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art, and seem to have gained a vague understanding.'

'...'

As time passed until late at night, with the final comprehension notification appearing, the skill list on his attribute panel prominently displayed the words: Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art (Not yet mastered).

Feeling the memories of the technique flowing spontaneously into his mind, Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with understanding, and he quickly withdrew from the Lin state.

The Azure Dragon governs concealment, the White Tiger governs killing intent. This is the true meaning inherited by the Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art.

The pores all over his body suddenly closed. The originally boiling, mercury-like blood, which displayed extreme vitality, immediately slowed its flow, as if forming a thick, jade-like liquid that flowed slowly through his blood vessels and flesh.

The sound of gold and jade chiming between his spine was replaced by an ancient rhythm, as if the roars of dragons and tigers echoed deep within his bone marrow.

The dragon scale armor he wore sensed its master's change, and its scales automatically contracted, fitting him almost like a skin-tight suit.

"So that's how it is!"

A look of joy appeared in Xu Yunfan's eyes.

This technique actually uses the image of a dragon and tiger contending as a guide to forcibly compress a martial artist's blood and vital energy into a 'Dragon Pearl and Tiger Soul'.

He tried to operate the essential techniques of the art. The aura of his Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Art, which was already at the Perfection realm, was immediately broken down into three hundred and sixty strands of qi, as fine as silk threads. They surged along existing meridians into the 'Hibernating Dragon Abyss' deep within his flesh and blood.

The Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art posits that this is where a person's essence, qi, and spirit converge, a place where one can hide a dragon and crouch a tiger when concealing oneself.

Suddenly, a sharp pain came from his chest.

The sword qi from the Three Fosters Sword Cultivation Art conflicted with the Hibernation Art, forming a vortex in the膻中 (Shanzhong) acupoint.

Instead of being alarmed, Xu Yunfan was delighted. He forcefully operated the Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art, and those restless sword energies were actually forged into countless transparent sword scales. They layered over his Three Fosters meridians, waiting to be activated at a moment's notice to unleash astonishing sword energy.

"Eh?"

Bi Yuan, who had been cultivating in a meditative state in the main hall atop Qingwei Mountain, suddenly opened his eyes. The teacup on the table before him rippled.

He could no longer sense Xu Yunfan's aura at all.

At that moment, Xu Yunfan was savoring the changes in the blood and vital energy within his body. Blood is the dragon, energy is the tiger. The two contend like a dragon and a tiger, yet they also hide a tiger and a dragon, and can even accompany each other. It was extremely profound.

Suddenly, enlightenment struck Xu Yunfan. As he operated the 'Mercury Blood Marrow Replacement' technique from the Marrow Cleansing Meridian Transformation Art, he simultaneously drew upon the Hibernation Art. Instantly, a sound like muffled thunder rang out from his entire skeleton.

This time, even the unique 'Jade Bone Chime' sound of the Marrow Cleansing Meridian Transformation Art was perfectly concealed, leaving only a stable breath like that of an ordinary person.

'Your Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art has reached the入门 (Entry) level.'

When the first ray of morning light pierced through the sea of clouds, Xu Yunfan could already complete the transformation of 'Dragon Submerging, Tiger Crouching' within ten breaths, thereby hiding a tiger and concealing a dragon, without revealing a single trace.

He tried to practice the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Art. The moves were still capable of splitting mountains and cracking stones, but the accompanying blood aura of a flood dragon was gone. Instead, it looked like an ordinary blacksmith forging iron.

Even the keen Lin Qingxuan, when passing by outside the courtyard, did not察觉 that a Marrow Cleansing realm master was hidden here.

"Quite interesting..."

Xu Yunfan looked down at his knotted muscles. He had a premonition that if this Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Art were to advance a step further, reaching the true state of hiding a tiger and concealing a dragon, the bulging muscles on his body would also be quickly smoothed and hidden, truly becoming indistinguishable from an ordinary person.

This martial art for concealing mechanisms and absorbing qi was of a quality no less than the Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock!

Hiding a dragon and a tiger within, a single move would be earth-shattering.

As usual, he took a breath of the ginseng baby's vital energy. After cultivating the Pure Yang One Qi Art, Xu Yunfan prepared to head to the main hall on the peak of Qingwei Mountain to find Bi Yuan before going to see Zhan Yan. But before he could take a step, a knocking sound came from outside the courtyard.

The young Taoist boy, Qing Song, was already calling from outside the door, "Senior Brother Xu, today's medicinal supplies have been delivered."

Xu Yunfan opened the door to see the young Taoist boy Qing Song holding a rosewood medicine box in both hands. The surface of the box was carved with the pattern of the Yin-Yang fish, and it even had the effect of concealing qi.

Behind him were two strong men carrying a half-person-tall jade-green medicine barrel, from which a strong scent of traditional Chinese medicine wafted.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised.

"Senior Brother Xu, this was specially ordered by the Sect Master to be delivered, and it will be the same every day from now on."

Qing Song respectfully presented the medicine box, "The twelve herbs inside are today's medicinal supplies..."

He lightly tapped the lid of the box, and an aroma of medicine immediately wafted out, causing the blood and vital energy in Xu Yunfan's body to involuntarily accelerate, while his Red Python energy constantly jumped.

Qing Song introduced, "Inside is the Nine-Revolutions Jade Liquid Soup for bathing the body, made from the cores of Kunlun snow lotuses and terrestrial spiritual milk. It only became available after the recovery of the world's primordial spiritual energy. The Red Essence Activating Blood Pill for strengthening blood and vital energy is refined from the bone powder of a strange beast's tiger bone combined with a century-old blood ginseng. And this bottle of Golden Marrow Opening Orifices Powder is best for aiding the efficiency of marrow cleansing, as it is infused with the energy of gold essence tempered by meteoric iron from beyond the heavens..."

Qing Song pointed things out as if he were enumerating his family treasures. With each item he mentioned, Xu Yunfan's eyes widened a bit more, until in the end, they were almost like two lanterns hanging on his face.

Xu Yunfan noticed that in the bottommost brocade box lay three azure-gold pills the size of dragon eyes, their surfaces covered in fine lightning patterns.

"What is this..."

He had just begun to ask when Qing Song lowered his voice.

"These are Lightning Tribulation Tempering Bone Pills, refined by Cloud Master Yun from the remnants of tribulation qi collected from the bottom of the Sword Burial Abyss.

Last month, one was auctioned in Dao City for an astronomical price."
