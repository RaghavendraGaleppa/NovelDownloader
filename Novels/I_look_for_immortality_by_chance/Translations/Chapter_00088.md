# Chapter 88: "Slaying Bian Chuyao"

"Senior Brother Shan, are you alright?!"  

Seeing the tall young man's pale face, Bian Chuyao smiled faintly, her voice gentle.  

"I... I'm fine, thank you for your concern, Junior Sister Bian!"  

The tall young man seemed to have experienced something terrifying, repeatedly touching his neck. Yet, upon hearing Bian Chuyao's voice, he forced himself to perk up and managed a smile.  

"I'm glad you're alright!"  

Bian Chuyao nodded, then turned to the others in the hall and said with a smile,  

"Senior Brothers, Senior Brother Shan has already demonstrated—this formation won't cause any harm. Even if you fail to ascend, you'll simply be returned to your original position. To save time, I will fully activate the formation. I hope all of you will enter and compete!"  

With that, she waved her hand, and the entire jade hall trembled slightly. Gu Yuan felt the space around him stretch.  

The distance between each jade table had originally been no more than ten feet, but now, they seemed dozens of feet apart, vast and boundless.  

The hall had become magnificent, seemingly infinite.  

Above, the starry river shimmered and swayed, as if divided into over twenty sections. From each segment, a silver-and-dark staircase descended, landing directly before each person.  

In an instant, over twenty staircases of alternating silver and darkness rose high into the air within the jade hall.  

"Senior Brothers, please!"  

Bian Chuyao gestured invitingly.  

*Thud! Thud!*  

Seeing this, the cultivators in the hall stood up one by one, steadied their breaths, and stepped onto the staircases before them.  

Noticing the others ascending, Gu Yuan no longer hesitated. With his sleeves hanging loosely, he stepped into the formation.  

*Thud!*  

The moment Gu Yuan set foot on the first step, he felt a heavy force surge from the staircase, striking against his mana.  

However, the force was weak. With just a slight focus of his mind, his mana remained unshaken, firmly resisting it.  

"Is this... a test of cultivation?"  

Gu Yuan took two more steps and noticed waves of strange energy continuously shaking his mana, as if hammering at something. He quickly understood the nature of this initial trial.  

It was merely a basic test of one's cultivation.  

Only those with insufficient mana would fail to ascend.  

Glancing around, Gu Yuan saw that no one in the hall was struggling with the first few steps—everyone was striding forward effortlessly.  

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*  

Gu Yuan continued without pause, calmly passing the first seven steps. Upon reaching the eighth, a tremendous force surged like a tidal wave, relentlessly battering his mana, as if trying to obliterate it entirely.  

For those with impure or unstable mana, this would have been nearly impossible to withstand.  

*Thud!*  

Yet Gu Yuan simply steadied his mind, and his mana stood firm like an unyielding boulder, allowing him to cross this step with ease.  

Though he had relied on external aids in his cultivation, he had never compromised his foundation. All the elixirs he consumed were neutral and gentle, and the Minor Giant Divine Wood was nurtured with his own essence blood, making it perfectly aligned with his mana—utterly free of impurities.  

*Thud!*  

But when he stepped onto the ninth step, the scenery before him abruptly changed.  

*Whoosh!*  

Torrential rain poured down. A dilapidated temple stood in the wilderness, looming before him.  

*Screech!*  

Before Gu Yuan could react, a strange cry echoed from the temple. The sound carried an eerie power, like an invisible beast lunging straight for his consciousness.  

At the same time, a black fox with emerald-green eyes and bloodstained lips emerged from the temple, its fangs bared as it lunged for Gu Yuan's throat with a foul, bloody stench.  

The attack was sudden and vicious, and the fox's strength was no less than that of an eighth-layer Qi Refining cultivator—making the situation dire.  

*Roar!*  

Yet, a savage and domineering roar erupted from the temple, freezing the lightning-fast black fox in place for a brief moment.  

*Splat!*  

A vibrant peach blossom bloomed from the fox's skull, reducing its head to a bloody pulp.  

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*  

Light returned to Gu Yuan's vision, and he found himself back on the staircase—somehow, he had already ascended seven more steps.  

"Direct combat trials right away?"  

Gu Yuan was slightly puzzled. He had expected tests of temperament or spiritual roots, but after the initial cultivation assessment, the trial had turned abruptly brutal.  

Looking around, he saw the others in varying states.  

Some, like him, stood on the fifteenth step with expressions of confusion. Others remained on the eighth step, eyes tightly shut.  

A single combat trial had already revealed the gaps between them.  

Those who had cleared the first trial cast cold glances at the others before confidently striding onto the next step.  

After a brief pause, Gu Yuan also stepped forward without hesitation, ascending to the next level.  

*Roar!*  

A tiger's roar shook the mountains, and a foul wind rushed toward him.  

Before Gu Yuan could steady himself, a massive white tiger, nearly ten feet long, charged at him, accompanied by a tide of black ghostly apparitions.  

The tiger's roar carried a terrifying soul-shaking force. An ordinary cultivator would have been stunned for a moment, only to be devoured by the beast.  

Yet Gu Yuan's gaze remained sharp, unclouded for even an instant.  

A colossal azure lotus bloomed beneath his feet, its petals unfurling layer by layer, radiating a purifying light that was both beautiful and potent.  

The tide of black ghosts shattered before they could even touch the lotus.  

*Boom!*  

But the white tiger, at the peak of the eighth layer, was formidable. Its massive body, wreathed in golden killing intent, tore through the lotus's defenses in mere moments.  

Yet a moment was all Gu Yuan needed.  

*Clang! Clang!*  

Sword energy sang, and peach blossoms rained down—perfect for slaying demons.  

In moments, the white tiger lay dead, slain by the Peach Blossom Sword Seal.  

When Gu Yuan opened his eyes, he had reached the twenty-second step.  

In the hall, only about ten others had made it this far. Several had already fallen far behind.  

*Thud!*  

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan ascended again.  

This time, it took him longer—over a dozen breaths—before he opened his eyes once more.  

Now, he stood on the twenty-ninth step.  

In the hall, eight others had also reached this level.  

One more step, and they would match Shan Yunlong's previous achievement.  

Shan Yunlong watched them nervously from below.  

Without pause, Gu Yuan and the others stepped forward once more.  

...  

"Save me, Senior Brother! Please save me!"  

Pleading cries filled the air as Gu Yuan's surroundings shifted again.  

Bian Chuyao was now bound to a jade pillar, her face streaked with tears, weeping pitifully.  

Her sobs carried an eerie power that tugged at the heart, filling Gu Yuan with an overwhelming sorrow—he couldn't bear to see her cry.  

Beside her stood a scar-faced Daoist, pressing a golden sword to Bian Chuyao's throat as he threatened Gu Yuan:  

"If you want to save her, surrender now..."  

"Save me, Senior Brother! I don’t want to die!"  

Bian Chuyao wept again, her cries wrenching at the heart, making it unbearable to resist.  

"First, destroy one of your seals, or else—"  

The scarred Daoist smirked coldly as the golden blade nicked Bian Chuyao's skin. Crimson blood trickled down her fair neck, a sight both tragic and beautiful.  

*Sssht!*  

But before the Daoist could finish, a pink peach blossom flashed by, slicing Bian Chuyao's throat open.  

Then, the blossom turned and struck the Daoist.
