# Chapter 214: Grandmaster's Methods

Everyone could see that the burly, heroic man on the Demonic Path was powerful and confident, his black hair flowing freely, full of wildness, as he pressed forward. His posture wasn't that of someone preparing for a decisive battle; he was spirited, commanding the stage, without a hint of tension, as if he had entered purely to reap.

"Our demon race's prodigious genius is truly this magnificent and confident! Quick, strike him down, cleave that immortal seed into two!" Within the Secret Realm, demons were already waving flags and shouting.

Li Qingxu's spirit, qi, and essence had changed. Nine divine chains circulated over his physical body and expanded into his spiritual light. His power surged violently because of this, actually increasing! A very dangerous aura emanated from his body. Then, a dull roar erupted from where he stood. Not only did this battlefield tremble slightly, but the high heavens of the Secret Realm also seemed to shake, awing many. Around Li Qingxu, a dense mist of light particles steamed. His feather robe fluttered, his aura ethereal, as if he were ascending as an immortal, sacred auspicious light illuminating all directions.

Many people stood on high mountains, watching from afar. Even at a great distance, they felt his power was exceptionally formidable, making them involuntarily tense their bodies. For a moment, all clamor ceased. Whether demons or disciples of various sects, everyone grew quiet, staring at the two figures in mid-air.

Passivity was not Qin Ming's nature. He moved like a divine demon, each step a blur, as if teleporting through mist, rapidly charging forward. Li Qingxu let out a soft cry. The dazzling light particles near him all shot out, and with sizzling sounds, all the "raindrops" elongated. Threads of rain, infinitely extending, growing longer and longer, exuded a dangerous aura.

The two's final battleground was a mountainous area, rich with vegetation, crisscrossed by high ridges, flowing streams, and strange rock formations, making the terrain quite complex. In an instant, trees and rocks along the way were penetrated, sliced, and completely shattered by those threads of rain. This destructive power was shocking. Many people were horrified, wondering what would happen if it were them. They would probably be torn apart in the blink of an eye!

Outside Qin Ming's body, two lights, one black and one white, intertwined like a dragon and a snake, rotating rapidly around him, forming a protective barrier of black and white. The incoming crystalline threads, upon touching the dragon-snake diagram, produced deafening clangorous sounds, like divine weapons colliding fiercely. Along the way, the scene was terrifying, transforming into a desolate land. Trees, massive rocks, and everything else were cleared away. The fine rain-like threads, though delicate, swept through everything, leaving nothing unbroken. There were no longer any obstacles between Li Qingxu and Qin Ming. This terrifying power was enough to tear some Outer Saints into pieces upon initial contact!

However, these elongated raindrops, like divine rainbow threads, were all blocked by the black-and-white dragon-snake diagram, and shattered apart. Qin Ming's hair flew wildly, like a demonic bird soaring across the sky, reaching his opponent's eyes in an instant. Extremely forceful, the dragon blade formed from sky-light in his right hand, entwined with a massive dragon shadow, cleaved downwards.

Around Li Qingxu, light particles boiled. The bamboo staff in his hand blocked the supremely rigid and pure-yang dragon blade. His other hand stretched out, like a golden roc extending its claw, dazzling runes swirling around it, grasping towards his opponent's head. The snake sword in Qin Ming's hand erupted with dark light, thrusting towards Li Qingxu's hand.

Bang, bang, bang! In an instant, the two moved like lightning, continuously changing positions, colliding multiple times. Blood splattered, staining the forest ground red. Soon, they separated silently like two phantoms.

Li Qingxu panted heavily. Blood streamed down his face; there was a dreadful wound, deep enough to expose bone. Most terrifyingly, there was also a saber wound on his head. Some of his black hair had been cut off, stained with blood, and was floating down. Everyone who witnessed this scene showed shock. Li Qingxu, in that posture, was undoubtedly extremely powerful, yet he was bleeding immediately upon engagement! Clearly, everyone realized that the youth on the Demonic Path had aimed for his head, intending to cleave him in two directly. Li Qingxu's mind was churning violently, as if an earthquake had occurred, somewhat disbelieving this outcome.

Qin Ming was uninjured, but he was frowning. He felt there was something peculiar about the nine divine chains wrapped around his opponent. Just now, it was those chains circulating on Li Qingxu's body that blocked the dragon blade, proving exceptionally tough. However, one of the divine chains extending towards Li Qingxu's head had been cracked by Qin Ming's strike and appeared on the verge of breaking.

Qin Ming was enveloped in a vigorous aura of sky-light. He raised his dragon blade, held his snake sword, his black long hair flying, and attacked forcefully once more. At this moment, he fully displayed his true demonic nature! No one would think he was a human youth. The "Dragon Snake Scripture" he was now exhibiting was obtained on this very path, an original version belonging to the demon race. Qin Ming, like a dragon in the sky, soared across. Saber and sword chimed together, black and white light surged.

Li Qingxu counterattacked. In the process, one of the divine chains on his body burst open, emitting a deafening sound. The energy fluctuation was utterly terrifying. Even Qin Ming was startled, suddenly stopping, holding his saber and sword, standing at a distance and staring at him. Another wound appeared on Li Qingxu's head. Large clumps of hair fell, and blood gushed, but it was still only a superficial wound. Many spectators, upon seeing this, were shocked and felt their scalps tingle. This youth from the Demonic Path truly aimed for the head with every strike.

Qin Ming's eyes narrowed slightly. He could feel that after Li Qingxu was injured, the vitality of his flesh and spiritual light actually increased. Moreover, Li Qingxu became incredibly proactive. A portion of his pure-yang spiritual light resonated and merged with the runic power in his flesh. In an instant, the bamboo staff in his right hand pointed to the sky. With a boom, golden light surged, erupting from his body, as thick as clouds and as heavy as mountains, pressing towards Qin Ming. Next, his other hand pointed to the ground. Silver light exploded, and earth-light steamed, like mercury surging upward, rising into the high heavens. In a flash, both golden and silver lights were vast and weighty, as if heaven and earth were closing in, trapping Qin Ming in the middle, intending to crush him into a bloody pulp.

At this moment, even immortal seeds and divine seeds from other paths were watching intently, because this was a terrifying technique frequently used by Cao Qianqiu. Over the years, Cao Qianqiu had crushed countless powerful experts with this method, his might shaking the Night Mist World. As for the other spectators, it went without saying; this instant felt like an eternity to them, their breathing stopped, and they dared not blink.

The silver earth-light rose, lifting Qin Ming up, while the golden cloud pressed down. The two, like millstones of mist, spun wildly, emitting terrifying explosive roars. Qin Ming stood tall, his eyes shining, long hair flying. The black-and-white dragon-snake diagram around his body blocked the combined force that seemed to come from heaven and earth. Naturally, he couldn't just passively defend. The dragon blade in his right hand rose, piercing towards the sky, while the snake sword in his left hand thrust towards the ground. In the first realm, few could materialize sky-light. But now, Qin Ming soared freely, fully displaying his transcendent talent. The dragon blade transformed again, becoming a true great dragon, piercing through the golden cloud, then incinerating all things like a scorching sun. At the same time, the snake sword in his left hand transformed into a massive black snake, carrying endless dark energy, diving towards the ground.

People watched from afar, utterly astounded. Li Qingxu's arms trembled. Between heaven and earth, it was as if two golden and silver continents were about to collide, or like two massive mist-formed millstones coming together, their power terrifying. Yet, someone used a saber and a sword to resist this "heavenly might"! Then, a dragon's roar echoed throughout the area. The great dragon pierced through and tore apart the golden sky curtain, while the massive black snake crushed the thick earth-light, shattering it. With a thunderous boom, dazzling light erupted between heaven and earth. The golden cloud exploded, and the silver earth-light scattered.

Cao Qianqiu's secret technique, a method that struck fear into opponents from all paths, was broken by the youth from the Demonic Path after being unleashed by his disciple, Li Qingxu! This area was filled with light. Even at a distance, sand and stones flew. Not to mention vegetation exploding, even underground roots were blasted apart. Amidst the scattered golden light and silver radiance, amidst violent energy fluctuations, Qin Ming displayed his dominant posture, traversing the dangerous mist-filled area and charging directly at his opponent. In an instant, saber light and sword shadows flashed here, and the black-and-white dragon-snake diagram roared. The two, like two bolts of lightning, collided and separated in the shattered mountainous terrain, vast amounts of blood splattering.

Qin Ming's brows furrowed deeply. At the last moment, a divine chain exploded, emitting inexplicable fluctuations, blocking him and forcing him back. Nevertheless, Li Qingxu was still heavily wounded by him. Ahead, the youth in the broken feather robe was covered in blood, leaning on his bamboo staff, his chest heaving continuously. He seemed to have expended a great deal. Another wound appeared on his head. This time, not only was his scalp cut open and hair falling, but cracks had also appeared in his skull.

Li Qingxu was enraged. He realized that his opponent was doing this deliberately, aiming for his head with every strike. In fact, this was quite similar to some of his own habits. In the Secret Realm, there was silence, then an uproar. The immortal seed Li Qingxu had been struck three times consecutively, and the demonic youth's every saber strike aimed to cleave his head. Many demons were incredibly excited, feeling that this demonic seed's methods were astonishing. From the moment he attacked, every engagement resulted in his opponent bleeding, fully showcasing his dominance.

"This is... a truly brilliant Demonic Path! He's even going to overwhelm the Immortal Path!" Gan Jincheng, Jiang Ruoli, Liu Hanhya, and others were all greatly shaken. The disciples from beyond the mortal realm were all alarmed. Many knew that Li Qingxu had used Cao Qianqiu's famous ultimate technique, yet it was swiftly broken?! Many stood on the mountain peaks, their emotions fluctuating as they watched the battle. Amidst the swirling mists, Li Qingyue stood still, her beautiful eyes shimmering with divine light. On another path, Little Wu chuckled foolishly; he wished he could also find Li Qingxu for a spar. After watching, Xiang Yiwu gesticulated with his hands, seemingly analyzing the technique with his own methods. Cui Chonghe stood with his hands behind his back, showing no discernible expression. Su Shiyun, Cai Jingcheng, Tang Yutian, and others closely monitored the entire battle.

Qin Ming no longer frowned. Instead, he smiled. Even if those divine chains were strange, what of it? He would just sever them all and see what lay beneath! Moreover, in this process, he could also use Li Qingxu to observe Cao Qianqiu's brilliant and powerful techniques.

In an instant, wind-fire energy appeared beneath Qin Ming's feet, like a sunset spreading across the ground, or a fiery red divine wheel lifting him. He rose from the ground, as if flying, and charged over in a flash. Li Qingxu's body was covered in light particles, re-enacting one of Cao Qianqiu's renowned techniques, one that had once caused many monumental elder experts in the Night Mist World to bleed. However, at this moment, the youth from the Demonic Path had glowing brows, radiating confidence and unmatched dominance, showing no reverence whatsoever for the so-called Elder Cao's famous ultimate art.

Qin Ming went straight for a frontal assault, unleashing the most fundamental essence of the Dragon Snake Scripture: rigid, fierce, and overbearing. When this scripture was cultivated to its peak, it possessed partial "Sky-Propping Characteristics," capable of shaking heaven and earth. The saber and sword in his hands were like lightning strikes piercing the night mist, like comets streaking across the sky. After multiple exchanges, he landed a saber strike that made Li Qingxu's eyes burn with fury, because it was another hit to the head! Then, Li Qingxu felt a sharp pain in his chest, as a sword pierced through him, blood splattering. Two divine chains on his body snapped consecutively, accompanied by gushing crimson blood.

"Let me see what's truly beneath your divine chains once I peel them away!" Qin Ming declared. This battle could both injure his opponent and allow him to analyze old Cao's methods. What more could he ask for?
