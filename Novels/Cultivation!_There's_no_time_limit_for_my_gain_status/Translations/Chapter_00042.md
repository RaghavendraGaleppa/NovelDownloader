# Chapter 42: Underwater Breathing

As the strongest among the eight in terms of outward appearance, Yu Banxia still carried some youthful arrogance and pride.

During this nighttime reconnaissance, he had suffered significant losses at the hands of those rogue cultivators while trying to rescue his two companions. Seeing Jiang Li sitting cross-legged so leisurely in the room made him feel particularly uncomfortable.

"Qianqian, come quickly and help with the healing!"

Lu Qianqian hurried over and began casting healing spells on the severely injured Qu Qianfan and Wang Liuliang.

"Apologies, everyone. We didn't gather much information this time," Yu Banxia began humbly. The others waved their hands dismissively—the fact that they had drawn away the enemies to allow the rest to escape safely was already the greatest contribution. The four who had fled secretly had no right to blame them.

"Jiang Li, what about you? Did you find out anything?" Yu Banxia turned to Jiang Li and asked again.

Previously, unaware of the events in Yinnan Kingdom, they had entered the city boldly and conducted their investigations openly, which led to their exposure and made them targets of rogue cultivators with ulterior motives. This incident clearly demonstrated how crucial intelligence was when traveling outside.

However, Yu Banxia didn't actually expect Jiang Li to have discovered anything significant. In his mind, Jiang Li was still just an early-stage Qi Refining cultivator with little combat ability. His question was more out of hope, seeing that Jiang Li seemed to have had some luck.

In response, Jiang Li didn't waste words. He pulled out a complete map of Yinnan Kingdom, spread it on a long table in the room, and began explaining.

"The emergence of that monster was just bad luck on our part. It has little to do with our mission. Essentially, it's a rumor spread by the Ascension Pavilion—a Golden Core cultivator's corpse recently transformed into a corpse demon, attracting many cultivators to investigate..."

Jiang Li pointed at the Mazu River basin on the map and elaborated in detail, leaving the others increasingly astonished. How had he managed to gather so much information in just two hours while also dealing with attacks from rogue cultivators?

If it were fabricated, his explanation was far too detailed and coherent. Besides, there was no reason for him to deceive everyone—what purpose would that serve? Moreover, the bloodstains on the map clearly indicated that he had gone through some ordeal to obtain this intelligence.

"Jiang Li, it's not that I don't believe you, but... how did you find all this out?" Yu Banxia hesitated but couldn't suppress his curiosity.

After downgrading the strength of the two rogue cultivators who had attacked him by one level each, Jiang Li briefly recounted the events.

---

"You're saying you defeated a mid-stage and an early-stage Qi Refining cultivator alone? And captured them? That... that's impossible!"

"Jiang Li, have you already broken through?"

If he were still at the early stage of Qi Refining, there was no way he could have accomplished such a feat—they were certain of that. Then, they all collectively gasped.

This meant that Jiang Li, without any fanfare, had surpassed most of them and reached the mid-stage of Qi Refining, just behind Yu Banxia.

"It was just luck. Your spiritual roots are no worse than mine—I'm sure you'll break through soon too. Besides, I wasn't exactly alone."

Jiang Li snapped his fingers, and the Black Zombie pushed open the door and entered. The pungent, rotting stench, though masked by medicine, was still overwhelming up close.

A Black Zombie's strength typically fell between mid and late-stage Qi Refining. Though it had obvious weaknesses, its thick hide and immense strength made it formidable if a cultivator wasn't specifically prepared to counter it.

"Ah! A zombie!" Lu Qianqian, being a young girl, was clearly terrified of such grotesque creatures. She immediately hid behind the others, not daring to look.

The rest weren't as panicked. Their initial reaction was instinctive alarm, but upon realizing the creature was completely under Jiang Li's control, they put away their cheap talismans, merely covering their noses against the foul stench.

"Jiang Li, is this what you brought in that coffin?" Yu Banxia recalled the coffin.

"Exactly. This time, the Black Zombie was a huge help. Smelly as it is, effectiveness trumps everything else."

With a wave of his hand, the Black Zombie retreated and vanished into the darkness, improving the air quality considerably.

Now convinced of Jiang Li's intelligence, the group focused on the map, pondering their next steps.

"If only we could contact the sect elders..."

The stretch of the Mazu River where the cultivators had gathered was in a wide, slow-moving section, quite far from Yinnan Kingdom's royal city. There was no way they could send up a signal and expect reinforcements to come rushing in.

To reach that area, they would have to traverse dangerous zones teeming with rogue cultivators. If all of them were at least mid-stage Qi Refining, they might have stood a chance. But with Jiang Li and Yu Banxia carrying six others, the odds were stacked against them.

At this point, it would be safer and more practical to simply return to the sect and report the situation.

Though waiting five days might mean missing out on an unexpected windfall...

After much deliberation, Jiang Li suddenly remembered something—two spirit herbs generously "donated" to him by the Jinghe Twin Fiends.

"I might have a way to try," Jiang Li said, drawing everyone's attention.

That night, Jiang Li didn't linger. He left the estate with the Black Zombie in tow.

The plan was simple: the other seven would remain in the royal city, doing their best to conceal the situation with the unconscious children. Jiang Li would go alone, navigating through the dangers to reach the lower reaches of the Mazu River and inform the sect elders.

In essence, he had taken the most difficult task upon himself. In return, Yu Banxia and the others promised him the largest share of the rewards. Jiang Li merely smiled without commenting.

Under cover of darkness, Jiang Li and the Black Zombie slipped out of the city walls and raced to the Mazu River. Glancing back at the vague figures tailing them and then at the vast river stretching endlessly before him, Jiang Li didn't hesitate. He pulled out a handful of seaweed-like aquatic plants from his bag and stuffed them into his mouth.

Then, with the Black Zombie, he plunged into the murky waters.

[Fresh Gillgrass consumed: Underwater Breathing applied to self.]  
[Underwater Breathing: Enables normal respiration underwater. Duration: 2 hours] (-+)  
[Fresh Gillgrass consumed: Algae Parasitism applied to self.]  

Holding the "+" for five seconds, [Underwater Breathing] became permanent.  
Holding the "-" for five seconds, [Algae Parasitism] was removed.  

A dozen breaths later, three figures arrived at the riverbank.  

"Damn it! The kid got away!"  

"Second Brother, what's going on? Weren't they supposed to be a bunch of clueless rich kids? How'd they slip through like this?"
