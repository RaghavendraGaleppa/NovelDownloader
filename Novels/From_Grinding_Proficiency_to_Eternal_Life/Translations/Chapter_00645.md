# Chapter 645: Come, and None Shall Leave

"Rocan?! No!"

His roar was more violent than any before, filled with disbelief and a murderous intent that reached the heavens.

A Mid-tier God at the peak! His most capable subordinate, the warrior with the highest hope of advancing to a High-tier God, had just fallen just like that?

But these were trivial words, and the focus wasn't here. What truly shocked him to the core was that Lockman was truly striking to kill.

Lockman was also greatly shaken inside.

Although he was controlled by restrictions, his mind was still his own.

Xu Yunfan had actually, in an instant, forcibly killed a Mid-tier God at the peak amidst a million-strong army.

This level of strength and ruthlessness...

It made Lockman's heart turn cold, but he had to grit his head and continue.

The matter was already irretrievable.

He looked at Buthus's face, twisted with rage, and the corner of his mouth beneath the ice mist pulled into a cold, stiff arc, tinged with a hint of bitter madness.

"Buthus, see? This is the price of provoking my Winter God System! Today, one of us will fall completely!"

The situation was completely out of control, but he had to play this role to the end.

Only then could there be a sliver of hope.

He hoped the Natural Lord God would gaze upon this place.

Lockman prayed in his heart.

That divine mournful cry instantly ignited the last bit of luck and restraint in the hearts of all the gods.

The fall of a Mid-tier God clearly told all participants on both sides.

This was no longer the friction over belief territories or tentative border conflicts of the past.

This was a battle to the death, a complete eradication of the other party's God System's foundation.

There was no longer any possibility of holding back.

All the gods felt a palpitation in their hearts. With their Divine Sparks, they possessed a long lifespan and naturally feared death.

But being affiliated with the two God Systems, leaving required a huge price, possibly even abandoning their Divine Spark and losing their status as gods.

Thus, they could only fight to the death.

"Roar!"

"Kill!"

"For the glory of Winter (Gale)!"

After a brief deathly silence, it erupted into an even more violent and brutal explosion.

All the gods' eyes turned red, with no more probing or holding back.

Divine Power was burned without regard for the cost, and Divine Arts were pushed to their extreme limits.

The collision of Frost and Gale instantly escalated.

The explosions from the collision of Divine Domains rose one after another, each like a small sun rising on the ice plain.

The earth cracked with sorrowful groans, and the sky was torn to shreds by the violent energy.

Ice Plain Barbarian warriors and Gale Cavalry fell in large swathes like wheat being cut down, only to be淹没 by the subsequent wave of warriors.

Life became incredibly cheap at this moment, only the will of the gods and the power of laws governed the destruction.

Xu Yunfan moved through the chaotic energy currents.

He avoided the heaven-destroying, earth-shattering area of the High-tier God's main battlefield. Once Buthus was killed, the gods under the Gale God System would most likely scatter and flee.

His targets were those Mid-tier and Low-tier Gods caught in bitter battles, their Divine Power heavily consumed or already injured.

Truly, it was like harvesting leeks; a casual grab would yield a harvest.

The Ethereal Banner of Starlight flickered with a dark light from time to time. Every time it lit up, it meant another divine remnant soul was quietly drawn into the banner, becoming nourishment for the Great Array of the Zodiac Stars.

It could be said to be usable regardless of friend or foe.

He hid in the shadows, concealing himself with causal secret techniques, and subtly deflected the perceptions of the gods on the battlefield on a small scale, making them unable to detect him.

He precisely and efficiently harvested the fruits of the divine war he had personally ignited. The Immortal Golden Nature within his body, under the operation of the Divine Sky Refining Cauldron, accumulated slowly but steadily.

With the death of every god, he could harvest a thread of pure Immortal Golden Nature of the corresponding attribute.

The Immortal Golden Nature he had refined within his body was also increasing.

Seventeen threads, twenty threads, twenty-three threads...

As time passed, under Lockman's near-desperate madness.

Buthus's青辉 (Azure Radiance) fluctuated violently around him, like a candle in the wind.

His perception frantically swept across the chaotic ice plain battlefield. The dozens of auras belonging to Mid-tier and Low-tier Gods of the Winter and Gale God Systems, which had been violently colliding, had, in a short period of time, been completely swallowed one by one by an invisible giant mouth.

It wasn't defeat, nor was it severe injury; it was complete annihilation.

Even the marks of their Divine Sparks and souls were erased from the law network of the Aetira World, leaving only the aftermath of the mournful cry of a god's fall dissipating at the level of laws.

"No, this is impossible, Lockman!"

Buthus roared hoarsely, the storm-conjured face twisting from extreme shock.

He suddenly turned his head, finally capturing the ghost-like figure flitting at the edge of the battlefield.

Tatus, no, it was the one disguised as Tatus!

He saw a dark banner shadow flash from the opponent's sleeve, and the last struggling Low-tier God of the Gale System was sucked in like a light mist, without even causing a ripple.

The entire battlefield, aside from the two High-tier Gods, Lockman and Buthus, who were still fiercely fighting, and the believers' armies below who still didn't know what had happened and were still fighting out of inertia, had completely quieted down on the god-level.

The two sides had a total of over thirty Mid-tier and Low-tier Gods. The backbone accumulated over the years by their Gale God System and the Eternal Frozen Court, along with the cannon fodder driven by Lockman from the Winter God System, had been harvested clean in such a short time.

A fear he had never experienced before instantly seized Buthus's heart.

The opponent's methods completely exceeded his understanding of divine war.

Where was this a war?

This was a hunt targeting gods!

He didn't even have time to be angry; the instinct for survival overwhelmed everything.

The core of the Gale God System was him, Buthus. As long as he was alive, he could escape this place, and then spend a long time to re-cultivate a God System. The Gale would still be able to sweep across the Northern Plains.

He didn't even have time to leave a threat.

In the flash of a thought, the wind pressure around Buthus suddenly contracted, and he instantly transformed into a青色神光 (Azure Divine Light) that almost merged with the spatial turbulence, about to tear through the void and escape.

However, at the moment he activated his Divine Power.

"The Array of the Zodiac Celestial Firmament Locking the World, activate!"

Xu Yunfan's voice rang out.

Hum!

The heavens and earth went dark for a moment.

Countless profound runes, outlined by紫金色雷霆 (Purple-Gold Thunder), suddenly lit up from the spatial nodes around the ice plain battlefield, interlinked, and instantly wove into a massive three-dimensional network covering a radius of dozens of miles.

The long sky was forcibly twisted and solidified, as if a layer of invisible Purple-Gold Thunder Copper had been poured over it.

The Azure Divine Light, which Buthus had transformed into, slammed into the invisible barrier of the array, bursting with dazzling light and a dull, heavy sound, and was violently弹回 (bounced back) to its original place, the Divine Power of Wind splashing and dissipating in all directions.

"What?!"

Buthus was horrified. He forcibly stabilized his dissipating Divine Power and looked with disbelief at the紫金牢笼 (Purple-Gold Cage) flowing with destructive thunder patterns around him.

This was definitely not the power of the Aetira World!

The array that imprisoned space, its core logic of laws was completely at odds with the authority of the Divine Path.

What made his heart and胆 (gall) split apart even more was that Lockman had already silently stopped his attack, retracted his Winter Divine Power, and, with a姿态 (posture) he had never imagined and was almost humble, lowered his head and stood to the side of the one who had been harvesting gods in the shadows, like the most obedient servant.
