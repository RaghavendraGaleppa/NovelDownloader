# Chapter 63: Medicine Shouldn't Be Taken Randomly

Taigu City, Tongtian Street.

Xiao Ji walked side by side with Qian Duoyu. Having just returned, they agreed to visit the auction house together the next day. Now, with their stomachs growling—or rather, their taste buds craving something flavorful—they decided to grab a bite.

Qian Duoyu wanted to treat Xiao Ji to a meal at the city's grandest restaurant, Bafang Tavern. But Xiao Ji glanced at the darkening sky and thought it was getting late. Preferring something simple, he needed to return to the inn to prepare for tomorrow's auction house visit. "I know a newly opened barbecue place," he suggested. "Let's just grab a quick bite. We can save the feast for after the auction tomorrow."

"Whatever you say, Brother Xiao," Qian Duoyu replied. 

To him, the Taoist before him was an extraordinary man—not greedy, not weak, never petty, and always considerate of others. In the world of cultivation, meeting such a good companion was nothing short of a blessing. With a friend like this, he knew better than to try winning him over with money. Xiao Ji was no wealth-obsessed cultivator.

The barbecue shop Xiao Ji had in mind was one he'd discovered during his first visit to the city. The owner had previously run a second-rate store but switched to the food business—specifically barbecue, the most popular choice—after failing to make ends meet with spirit stones. 

Roasted beast meat was indeed a decent trade, and for the first three years after opening, they even offered a 20% discount. The place wasn't hard to find either—just follow Tongtian Street to the very end, and it would be the last shop on the street.

At the street's end, many cultivators still lingered, searching for work. Their eyes filled with wariness as newcomers approached, only relaxing once they confirmed the arrivals weren't there to steal their opportunities.

Standing beneath the sign for "Sihai Barbecue," Xiao Ji surveyed the chaotic scene inside—tables and chairs stacked haphazardly, the outdoor grill cold and abandoned. His heart sank. He'd wanted to treat the wealthy cultivator to barbecue, but it seemed their plans were falling through.

A cultivator wearing an apron sat on the threshold, arms crossed as he gazed at the setting sun.

"Looks like we're too late. They're closed," Qian Duoyu said, disappointed.

"No, they're not just closed," Xiao Ji corrected after a glance. "They've gone out of business."

The owner of Sihai Barbecue, noticing the visitors, listlessly turned his gaze to Xiao Ji, finding him somewhat familiar. 

"You two, better eat somewhere else," the owner said.

"Fellow cultivator, has your shop gone under again?" Xiao Ji asked knowingly.

Unfazed, the owner cleared his throat and replied earnestly, "It's not exactly 'gone under.' More like cutting losses early. Here's the thing—barbecue might seem like a small business, but the costs add up. Pots, pans, skewers, grills, seasonings—and most importantly, the meat has to be fresh. The beast meat in Taigu City's markets is fresh, sure, but it's also expensive."

He continued, "I did some digging. Established shops have dedicated suppliers for their meat, so their costs are low. Plus, running a barbecue place requires staff—you can't do it alone. You need experienced grill masters, prep cooks, skewer assemblers, servers, cashiers..."

"I was impulsive when I decided to get into barbecue. It's exhausting work, keeping you busy from dawn till dusk, and it's even set back my cultivation."

The owner might have been a terrible businessman, but he was a great talker. 

Xiao Ji was about to lead Qian Duoyu elsewhere for a meal—he was determined to treat him today—when the owner launched into his next business idea.

"I'm planning to open a shop specializing in bone-setting and shoulder massages for cultivators," the owner suddenly declared with enthusiasm.

Xiao Ji raised an eyebrow. "For that kind of service, wouldn't people prefer places like Warm Fragrance Pavilion?"

"No, no," the owner said confidently. "I'm targeting a niche—specifically helping cultivators who've broken arms or legs in combat recover faster. Given that I've nearly burned through my family's savings, a business that relies on skill rather than capital is perfect for me."

"But people could just go to proper clinics for that," Xiao Ji pointed out kindly.

"True," the owner conceded. "But here's the thing—my place might not be as effective, but it'll be dirt cheap. I want to make sure no cultivator ever has to go without a shoulder or thigh massage..."

It was that last line that unexpectedly fired up Qian Duoyu. "Just for that," he declared, "I, Qian Duoyu, will invest in your venture."

The owner's name was Pei Yisheng. In less time than it took to eat a meal, he secured the first investment of his life, with Qian Duoyu becoming his business partner. Xiao Ji, meanwhile, became the shop's first customer.

His review? "Guaranteed to lose money."

As they parted ways, Xiao Ji and Qian Duoyu confirmed their plans to meet at the auction house the next day.

[Qian Duoyu watches your retreating figure with envy, resolved to train harder so he can one day become a cultivator like you.]

"What's so enviable about the peak of Qi Refinement?" Xiao Ji mused to himself.

[He plans to take enhancement pills tonight, mixing stamina-boosting and spirit-energy pills... The combination causes blockages in his meridians, and his forced circulation leads to chaotic energy flow...]

"Now that's not good," Xiao Ji sighed, turning back.

He caught up with Qian Duoyu and stopped him. 

"Brother Qian, I noticed something off about your complexion earlier," Xiao Ji said. "Let me take a closer look."

Qian Duoyu waved it off. "You're overthinking it, Brother Xiao. I've always been in excellent health."

"Your qi and blood are surging, your meridians are in disarray—this is clearly from excessive pill use. Do you often rely on elixirs for cultivation?" Xiao Ji bluffed.

"It's not just reliance—I've pinned most of my cultivation hopes on pills. My talent is lacking, after all," Qian Duoyu admitted. "As my father put it, when your aptitude falls short, make up for it with pills."

"Pills shouldn't be taken recklessly. Keep this up, and you might die," Xiao Ji said gravely. "Since fate brought us together, I'll teach you how to take them properly. It won't guarantee rapid advancement, but at least you won't die..."

The fear on Qian Duoyu's face was evident. "I'm in your debt, Brother Xiao."

Reflecting on his cultivation journey, he recalled how his father had hired many teachers in his youth, each teaching different methods that left his training fragmented. The same went for pills—some told him to take energy-boosting pills, others prescribed dispersing agents, strength enhancers, or mind-focusing concoctions...

It had all become so chaotic that he'd started taking them all at once. This was his own doing, but now that he thought about it, there might indeed be hidden dangers.

Xiao Ji decided to guide him. "You need a scientific approach—don't worry about what 'scientific' means. Just know that pills shouldn't be taken randomly, and more isn't always better... No more than three types a day, no more than three pills per dose, with at least two hours between doses... Seven days per cycle, then three days of rest..."

After Xiao Ji's detailed guidance, Qian Duoyu resolved to follow his advice—taking pills at fixed times morning, noon, and night, with strict rules on which to take when.

On his way back to the inn, Xiao Ji realized that knowing too much could be exhausting. 

But it also felt incredibly satisfying. 

He had just unwittingly saved the life of a cultivation tycoon. If someone like that died, who would inherit such vast wealth?
