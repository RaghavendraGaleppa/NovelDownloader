# Chapter 169: The Remnant's Mutation

Xu Yunfan's eyelids were heavy with sleep. He slowly closed his eyes and drifted into a deep slumber.

As Xu Yunfan's breathing became long and steady, the Extreme Dao Remnant he had carefully wrapped like a vest began to ripple with fine, scale-like patterns. This lifeless skin suddenly seemed to come alive, glowing with a pale, moon-like luminescence. The entire remnant writhed like an earthworm, and the knots Xu Yunfan had tied loosened as if slicked with oil, sliding apart effortlessly.

The remnant completely unfurled, taking the shape of a human silhouette, and silently clung to Xu Yunfan's body.

Deep in his sleep, Xu Yunfan remained unaware. The Pure Yang Internal Energy, dormant deep within his flesh at his waist and abdomen, began to stir. Drawn by an unknown force, it transformed into a trickling stream, flowing continuously into a dark red scab at the center of the remnant's chest.

Soon, threads of silver silk emerged from the skin and extended into Xu Yunfan's nostrils.

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, looking at everything before him in confusion.

He was standing on a snow-covered mountain path.

A piercing, violent wind swept past his cheeks, carrying ice crystals. His entire body tensed slightly, but the steaming blood energy moved naturally, quickly warming him up again.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan felt something and subconsciously looked up. At the peak of the thousand-ren high cliff ahead, he saw a figure in pure white robes.

The woman stood barefoot on ice blades as thin as cicada wings. Her flowing sleeves were adorned with tiny starlight, and her long, black hair danced endlessly in the cold wind. With a slight lift of her bare foot, she seemed ready to ride the wind and depart.

When ice crystals touched the space within three zhang of her, they froze into snow butterflies, fluttering their wings and scattering blue phosphorescent dust and specks of starlight. It was a beautiful sight.

"Defeat me, and I will spare you," she said.

Her cold voice carried the resonance of the snowy mountains. Before Xu Yunfan could clearly see how the woman turned, ice lotuses suddenly exploded before his eyes.

The figure, whiter than snow, stepped on lotus petals and crossed the distance in an instant. Her slender jade-like fingers, condensed with frost, aimed straight for his throat.

*True Qi?!*

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. His muscles and tendons tensed instinctively, making a sound like a bowstring snapping.

*Crack!*

The sound of his throat bone shattering and the bone-chilling cold exploded simultaneously.

Xu Yunfan stumbled back several steps, clutching his throat spurting out ice shards. He looked at the snow dust falling from the woman's sleeve with disbelief. That was not True Qi; it was an extreme cold energy that froze the air into a solid substance.

His eyes burned intensely. The muscles around his Adam's apple began to writhe like small snakes, pulling his shattered windpipe back together. Then, the fascia covering his Adam's apple pulsed and locked it in place.

The shattered bone fragments, under the scouring of his Pure Yang Internal Energy, sounded like red-hot iron being hammered by an invisible blacksmith, cracking and clicking as they reconnected. The thick tendons on his neck twisted and stretched, pulling the collapsed trachea open by three inches.

Although cracks remained, it no longer hindered his normal movements. Only then did he feel like he could finally breathe out.

The woman's frost-covered eyebrows arched slightly as she lightly tapped the ice with her toe.

Xu Yunfan had just inhaled a breath of air filled with ice shards when six-pronged ice flowers suddenly bloomed before his eyes. That pure white figure split into seven afterimages in the refraction of the ice crystals. Her slender fingers turned into seven different ice blades—Emei daggers, mandarin duck halberds, noon hairpins... each move aimed for his regenerating throat.

"Cough!"

As Xu Yunfan leaned back, Pure Yang Qi instinctively surged into his neck. The knotted back muscles swelled up, pulling his spine into a bizarre bow shape. Five ice blades grazed his newly connected Adam's apple, even slicing through his skin and leaving bloody marks.

*I caught you!*

Xu Yunfan seized the moment to spin and throw an elbow. Blood energy steamed and churned rapidly, causing a golden sheen to ripple through his muscles. The explosive force generated by his footwork let out a sharp whistle. He slammed his elbow toward the woman's exposed ribs, but the moment he touched the sheer fabric, he realized with shock that her body was as light as a flying snowflake.

The feeling of hitting nothing made him realize he was in trouble. A coldness even more piercing than before suddenly transmitted from his throat.

It turned out the seventh afterimage was the real body.

The woman maintained an elegant posture with her left hand, as if plucking a flower in the snow, while her right hand had condensed into a玄冰 blade shaped like a wild goose feather. The blade edge precisely cut into the gap of his contracting neck muscles, moving along the spinal column like a butcher dismembering an ox. Xu Yunfan could even clearly hear the grating sound of the ice blade scraping against his newly grown neck bone.

The instant his head flew from his body, he saw not a single ripple of emotion on the woman's face.

Xu Yunfan suddenly opened his eyes. He was still on the mountain path. The headless body that had been killed lay not far away.

*His own body!*

A chill ran down his spine.

He glanced at the attribute panel that had popped up in his vision.

**[You fought a life-and-death battle with an unknown powerhouse in your dream. Proficiency in Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique has increased.]**

Just that single notification added three points of proficiency!

"Who exactly are you?!" Xu Yunfan took a half-step back, assuming the starting stance of his hammer technique.

This time, when the woman turned, he clearly saw a silver vertical mark appear on her forehead, like a third eye. Within her pupils, nine ice crystals formed a Dao pattern.

"Defeat me, and I will spare you."

Her answer was the sudden collapse of the snowfield.

The woman tapped with her toe, and the snow atop the entire mountain peak turned into a massive wave, crashing down.

Xu Yunfan instinctively mobilized his Pure Yang Internal Energy, merging it with his flesh. Rising steam instantly turned the moisture around him into a mist. He roared and threw a punch to resist. The moment his scorching fist wind melted through the snow wall, he saw the figure, whiter than snow, breaking through the hole.

She pointed her fingers like a sword, stabbing toward his heart. The cold energy coiling around her fingertips made him break out in goosebumps before it even arrived.

The Pure Yang Internal Energy trembled through his muscles, manifesting as a qi armor around his body, yet it still could not block this sword finger.

Watching the sword finger rapidly enlarging in his vision, Xu Yunfan opened his mouth.

"I f*cking..."

The curses Xu Yunfan never finished in his throat turned into ice shards and fell. When his vision focused again on the snowy mountain path, golden fire patterns ignited deep within his pupils.

The second corpse of himself appeared at his feet. Xu Yunfan, reopening his eyes, wore an extremely gloomy expression.

**[You fought a life-and-death battle with an unknown powerhouse in your dream. Proficiency in Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique has increased.]**

It increased by another three points, but the feeling of being instantly killed was deeply unsatisfying.

The opponent's strength exceeded his imagination.

This time, he was fully prepared.

"Lin!"

The Daoist mantra exploded on the tip of his tongue. His sea of consciousness instantly became clear as a mirror. The deity within his sea of consciousness stepped out from the mist, stabilizing his seven emotions and suppressing his desires.

Xu Yunfan's originally gloomy expression quickly entered a state of neither joy nor sorrow. He clearly saw the trajectory of every strand of internal energy surging through his blood vessels, heard the faint cracking sounds of bone marrow producing blood, and felt the explosive power brought about by his body being frantically squeezed under the effects of the 'Lin' mantra.

"Defeat me, and I will spare you."

Xu Yunfan's expression remained calm as he simply raised his hand.

The moment the woman turned, Xu Yunfan had already predicted that her toe would shatter the seventh ice rock.

His boiling blood energy completed twelve layers of force accumulation within a thousandth of a second. The fist edge of his right fist cut through a turbid white airwave, creating a sonic boom, and, wrapped in the qi armor formed by strands of Pure Yang Internal Energy, slammed down on the预定 (predetermined) landing point.
