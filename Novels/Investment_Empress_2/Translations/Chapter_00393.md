# Chapter 393: A Situation Worse Than a Physical Fight, Becoming an Official?

The main peak's great hall fell into an eerie silence.

The长老们 (Elders) were first left disheveled by the wind, then some became as anxious as ants on a hot pan, some fell into deep thought, and others wondered if it was still possible to leave the sect behind.

"You... you slapped the Crown Prince's face?"

Qian Bufan was stunned, his small, beady eyes losing their focus.

Li Mo coughed lightly. "Ahem, actually, that's just a figure of speech. I didn't actually hit him."

Before the Elders could let out a sigh of relief, they heard Li Mo continue.

"It might be a little bit worse than actually hitting him."

"???"

The Elders' vision went black, nearly choking on the breath they hadn't fully exhaled.

Shang Wu was already unrivaled in the art of causing trouble, yet there was someone even better at it than her.

Who taught you to surpass your master like this?!

Sect Master Shangguan Wen seemed relatively calm and asked, "What exactly happened?"

"Chulong was being bullied by the sword servant beside Jiang Yu. I stepped in to stop it, and a conflict arose."

Li Mo said, holding a vegetable basket.

Chulong?

That little girl who serves tables at the Hot Pot of Pleasant Goat?

That girl was soft and delicate, evoking pity. Hearing this, the Elders understood Li Mo's actions to some extent.

Besides, Jiang Yu didn't have "Crown Prince of the Great Yu" written on his forehead. Seeing his own delicate flower being bullied, it was natural for him not to tolerate it.

The Elders frequented the hot pot restaurant and could tell the girl had astonishing talent. Coupled with Mei Yun, a powerhouse of the Inner Scenery realm, constantly by her side, they had a vague idea of her extraordinary background, but they didn't know the specifics.

"Be more specific," Shangguan Wen said in a deep voice.

Li Mo coughed lightly. "Chulong... also has the surname Jiang."

Also... Jiang?

One of the Elders' puzzles was solved. Why would the Crown Prince of the Great Yu go out of his way to cause trouble for that girl.

Jiang Chulong, is she of the imperial family?

But a new confusion arose immediately.

If she were a princess of the Great Yu, why would she be serving tables at a hot pot restaurant? And what complex reasons led to the Crown Prince refusing to let the matter rest...

But one thing was certain.

Li Mo had accidentally gotten caught up in the whirlpool of the imperial family.

Even the affairs of wealthy families are unfathomably deep; how much more so the treacherous currents of the imperial family?

Elder Qian advised, "Run. Don't even pack your valuables. Run to the Southern Frontier, and never return to the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths in this lifetime. Hmm, take Shang Wu with you."

"If I run, what about you guys?" Li Mo shook his head.

Xue Jing sighed. "If the Crown Prince wants to settle the score, it doesn't matter whether you're here or not."

"What about that Profound Powerhouse?" Elder Han He still remembered the green lotus that grew in the clear sky and bright land.

"It might be related to Chulong's master. I stumbled into it by accident."

Li Mo put the Shenshen Lingzhu back into his system space.

Shangguan Wen, Qian Bufan, Xue Jing, Han He, and the other Elders roughly understood the whole story.

Jiang Chulong had another master. That existence initially didn't want to bully the young with their status. It just happened that Li Mo arrived, so they watched from the sidelines.

Only when the protector behind Jiang Yu made a move did that hidden powerhouse reveal herself.

The other party clearly had no connection to the Qingyuan Sect.

And that couldn't erase the fact that Li Mo had offended the Crown Prince's procession.

"What should we do?" Elder Qian was also at a loss.

No one answered. Only the heavens knew the answer to this.

If the Crown Prince were to pursue the matter, Li Mo's only way out would be to run, spending the rest of his life hiding under the pursuit of the Patrol Sky Guards.

And what would become of the Qingyuan Sect?

---

It would be perfectly reasonable to be held accountable for poor discipline...

"Let's... wait and see," Shangguan Wen said after a long silence and much deliberation.

"Li Mo just rendered a great service in the Southern Frontier. This is known to the world. By the public principles of the light, they cannot deal with him arbitrarily."

"Yes, everything within the sect will proceed as originally planned."

"Tomorrow, we will first probe Jiang Yu's attitude."

The Elders began to discuss among themselves, all trying to find a solution. Not a single one suggested turning their own disciple over to face judgment.

A warmth surged in Li Mo's heart.

"If all else fails, we can just take the Qingyuan Sect away with a Small World."

"Hopefully, it won't come to that."

......

Ziyang Prefecture City.

In the residence of the Prefecture Lord, Jiang Yu sat in the seat originally belonging to the Prefecture Lord, gently stroking a gleaming long sword, his eyes narrowed in thought.

"Your Highness, the powerhouse protecting that boy cannot be found in the records of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. His origins are unheard of."

"He likely doesn't belong to any known force, and might not even be from this era," said a thin, elderly man seated to the side.

In other words, the powerhouse who manifested as a green lotus might be that boy's master.

"Mm," Jiang Yu responded noncommittally, still stroking the sword in his hand. Suddenly, he frowned.

A wisp of bright red slid down the blade, as if the divine sword in his hand was silently protesting in this way.

"Your Highness!"

The cyan-clad sword servant quickly took out precious medicine to bandage his hand.

"That boy is too arrogant. Just because he's fourth on the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List) and has a Profound Powerhouse as his master, he thinks he can do whatever he wants," the pink-clad woman said resentfully after bandaging his arm.

It was natural for them to think this way.

In any case, that mysterious Profound Realm expert was clearly protecting Li Mo.

And Li Mo was just a disciple of a prefecture-level power in the Eastern Wasteland. To rise so quickly, he must have had some other fortuitous encounter.

"You want me to kill him?" Jiang Yu glanced sideways at the pink-clad sword servant, his dual pupils filled with scrutiny.

As a servant, she was usually arrogant, but she was going a bit too far today.

He had never said he wanted Jiang Chulong to be disfigured.

The pink-clad sword servant opened her mouth, her tone softening. "I wouldn't dare. It is up to Your Highness to decide."

Jiang Yu said calmly, "I won't kill him. I will even grant him an official position."

"An official position?"

The two female sword servants exchanged a glance, both seeing the astonishment in each other's eyes.

The thin old man said淡淡ly (calmly):

"Your Highness is benevolent and broad-minded. How could you not have the capacity to tolerate others?"

"However... if that boy can survive leaving the Lankui Mountain, then he is lucky and blessed."

Jiang Yu would do nothing.

But there were those who would naturally rack their brains to serve the Prince, whether he needed it or not. As long as they felt the Prince needed it, they would do it, hoping to win the favor of the current Crown Prince and future Emperor.

For example, eliminating an eyesore.

PS: I'm not intentionally cutting the chapter at a cliffhanger. I've reached the word count limit, so I'm posting for now. This isn't a paid novel, so there's no need to trick readers into subscribing to the next chapter.

The storyline between Jiang Yu and Jiang Chulong is a challenge for me, and I hope I can do a decent job with it.

Please give me some support, mwah.
