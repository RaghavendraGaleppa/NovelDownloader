# Chapter 86: Between Life and Death

"Fellow Daoist eavesdropping outside, won't you come in after listening for so long?"

Lin Shan's footsteps froze abruptly, not daring to move a muscle. His mind raced for countermeasures. Unless something unexpected happened, tonight would present the most dire life-or-death situation he'd ever faced.

One wrong step would mean utter ruin!

A Foundation Establishment cultivator could project their divine sense a hundred meters and fly on swords.

He couldn't win in a fight, couldn't escape, couldn't hide. If captured, there would be no chance of recovery. Given his current relationship with Princess Guo, death would be certain.

*Creak—*

The door opened, revealing an elderly man and a young woman. The solemn-faced old man wore a yellow Daoist robe, hands clasped behind his back, while the blue-robed young woman followed respectfully.

"Show yourself. Your petty tricks might fool Qi Condensation cultivators, but they're transparent to me."

The royal family's Foundation Establishment elder spoke expressionlessly, his gaze fixed on a spot ahead.

Lin Shan had no choice but to deactivate his Invisibility Talisman and Qi Concealment Talisman, gradually revealing himself. He could feel himself completely locked down by the pervasive divine sense—there was no escape.

"It's you! How dare you—" Princess Guo gasped in shock upon seeing Lin Shan materialize in the empty courtyard, instantly realizing he'd come to eliminate her.

Lin Shan bowed helplessly to the elder. "This junior pays respects to the elder. I truly didn't know you were here. If I've disturbed—"

Before he could finish, the elder turned to Princess Guo. "You know him? Who is he?"

"Honored Ancestor, this is the man who ambushed us on the road and killed the Great Yan Princess," she replied promptly.

Lin Shan abandoned formalities to refute: "Nonsense! It was the four of you who ambushed me with the Great Yan Princess. Why would I take on five people alone—"

Their conflicting accounts filled the courtyard until—

"Enough!"

The elder's roar silenced them both. The oppressive wait felt like an eternity.

After a pause, the elder looked directly at Lin Shan. "Did you kill the Great Yan Princess?"

Lin Shan's heart sank. Clearly, the elder didn't care about who ambushed whom or whether Lin Shan acted in self-defense—only whether he'd killed the princess.

Princess Guo smirked triumphantly, relishing Lin Shan's predicament. Remembering how he'd nearly killed her twice by the stream, only to now stand helpless before her ancestor, filled her with satisfaction.

As sweat trickled down Lin Shan's temples, he sensed the air thickening with inevitability. No explanation would sway the biased elder. In that breath, he made his decision.

*As long as I can move, I won't surrender. I have the Enhancement Panel, a bright future ahead. If I escape today, I can return stronger!*

In an instant, Lin Shan drew a Bloodburn Talisman from his pouch, igniting his vital essence. Simultaneously activating Windriding Technique, he vaulted over the wall with explosive speed, fleeing into the night.

Princess Guo gaped in shock—who would dare flee from a Foundation Establishment expert? The elder chuckled, amused by the audacity, yet swiftly summoned a golden flying sword. Mounting the enlarged blade, he shot after Lin Shan without a backward glance.

The night sky over the capital became a spectacle: a green-and-crimson streak pursued by golden radiance, their residual energy painting luminous trails. Cultivators throughout the city emerged to witness the chase.

Lin Shan endured his burning essence, but his altitude steadily dropped—his initial burst couldn't sustain flight. The golden light closed in, revealing the composed elder astride his sword, certain of his prey.

As the gap narrowed, the elder pointed like a blade, conjuring twenty-odd golden swords that streaked forward.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Onlookers saw the fleeing figure battered like a broken kite before plummeting.

*Thud!*

"Cough—" Lin Shan rose from the street, organs bruised, talisman disrupted. Only his high-grade defensive artifact had saved him from being diced midair.

Facing the hovering elder, Lin Shan acknowledged the chasm between Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment—he couldn't even withstand a casual strike.

Despair flashed through him. The elder had been visiting the Murong family; who knew he'd return tonight to question Princess Guo about the missing princess? Some crises arrived without warning.

The path to immortality was fraught with peril—one misstep meant doom.

Yet Lin Shan refused to yield. Raising his Cloud-Copper Heartguard Mirror, he desperately strategized how to use his Enhancement Panel's ancient aura to survive. Future Foundation Establishment concerns were irrelevant now—living came first.

But what to enhance? 

- *Seven Nails Curse Art?* Impossible to cast face-to-face, and cursing a stronger cultivator was suicide.  
- *Gale Technique?* Even enhanced to high-grade, it couldn't harm a Foundation Establishment expert who surely had high-grade spells themselves—unless upgraded to a divine ability, which required time he lacked.  
- *Heartguard Mirror?* Enhanced to a treasure-grade defense might buy time, but prolonged defense would still fail.  
- *Qi Concealment Talisman?* Upgraded to a high-grade Stealth Talisman might evade divine sense, but he couldn't disappear mid-fight unless doubly enhanced to divine-grade.  
- *Frostiron Sword?* Double-enhanced into a flying sword treasure might deliver a surprise lethal strike...

Weighing each option, Lin Shan scrutinized every possible path to survival.
