**Chapter 51: An Entrance and a Conclusion**

"This Fourth Prince's combat prowess is truly fierce!" Lu Xu couldn't help but click his tongue as he watched the battle unfold in the clearing.

The Fourth Prince fought with broad, sweeping movements, almost entirely neglecting defense. Some talismans Mo Qingchan threw were dispelled with a single slap when they reached him. He shattered a fireball with one palm, his skin not even showing a trace of scorching. This powerful display made Lu Xu's eyes burn with envy. The combat strength of someone who cultivates both spirit and body is truly formidable!

It was clear that even fighting the Fourth Prince alone, Mo Qingchan was struggling. What's more, she also had to face attacks from the guard. However, she was, after all, the inheritor of the Mo family's greatest legacy, and she possessed quite a few trump cards. Releasing a Tier 1 High-grade Wind Blade Talisman, countless dense green wind blades immediately swarmed towards the two men. The Fourth Prince's expression changed. This time, he didn't dare to withstand the talisman with his body. He quickly recalled his azure ruler artifact, making it rapidly expand to shield himself.

Mo Qingchan pressed her advantage, flicking her hand to activate a Fire Rain Talisman. Flames poured down like rain, engulfing both the Fourth Prince and his guard. The Fourth Prince, with his sharp eyes, vaguely spotted a walnut-sized object mixed within the fire rain. He secretly thought, "Not good!" and quickly activated a Water Curtain Talisman, enveloping himself and his guard. At the same time, he desperately used the azure ruler to protect himself.

"Boom!"

After an earth-shattering explosion, countless plumes of smoke and dust rose from the ground, engulfing the Fourth Prince and his guard. "How is this Fourth Prince so poor? He hasn't used any trump cards. This doesn't match his status!" Lu Xu, watching from afar, couldn't help but grumble to himself. In his opinion, the Fourth Prince was practically pathetic, fighting for a long time without bringing out anything decent.

As the dust settled, Lu Xu saw the Fourth Prince's guard looking terribly wretched, clutching an arm, blood oozing from the corner of his mouth as he glared resentfully at Mo Qingchan. The Fourth Prince himself also looked quite disheveled and dusty. His Water Curtain Talisman had been broken, and his face was pale, clearly having expended a lot of spiritual energy. Mo Qingchan tapped her storage bag, and another Fire Thunder Orb appeared in her hand.

"Wei Yuantu, do you still think you can defeat me?" Holding the Fire Thunder Orb, she looked coldly at the Fourth Prince and his guard and spoke. Hearing this, the Fourth Prince's expression fluctuated between dark and light. The opponent still had a Fire Thunder Orb in her hand, which was somewhat beyond his expectations. If they continued to fight, with his powerful physical body, he was confident he could withstand the explosion of Mo Qingchan's Fire Thunder Orb. But his guard would likely die here.

"Your Fire Thunder Orb won't kill me. Once you've used it, let's see what other methods you have to resist me!" the Fourth Prince said with a grim expression, looking as if he didn't want to give up.

"Oh? Then guess if I have a third Fire Thunder Orb? And are you going to ignore the life of your subordinate?" Mo Qingchan said faintly. It was clear that she also had reservations and didn't want to use the Fire Thunder Orb in her hand; otherwise, she would have just thrown it down, why bother saying so much? Now both sides had their concerns, and the Fourth Prince fell silent.

"Not good. They're not going to make peace, are they? Then how am I going to pick up the spoils?" Lu Xu's heart stirred, and he immediately made his move.

"Whoosh!"

An ice cone radiating chilling cold suddenly shot out from the forest, heading for the Fourth Prince's guard. The guard reacted extremely fast, quickly activating his artifact to block the ice cone behind him. But his expression changed drastically moments later, as he saw dozens of dense ice cones following closely behind the first one.

"Not good! An ambush!" This sudden attack startled all three people present. The Fourth Prince and Mo Qingchan quickly adopted defensive postures.

The ice cones densely shot towards the guard. The opponent had just been blasted by the Fire Thunder Orb, was severely injured, and had little spiritual energy left. Facing so many ice cones, he could only barely resist. While desperately waving his artifact to cut down ice cones, he called out to the Fourth Prince for help.

The Fourth Prince hesitated for a moment. He still had a Water Curtain Talisman on hand; if he used it, he could block these ice cones. However, if Mo Qingchan then threw another Fire Thunder Orb, he would find it very difficult to resist. "Where did this despicable scoundrel come from!" The Fourth Prince cursed inwardly, quickly activating his artifact and sending it towards the ice cones. But as soon as his artifact moved, Mo Qingchan's artifact struck towards him. The Fourth Prince cursed loudly and quickly recalled his artifact to defend against Mo Qingchan. He was powerless.

Dense ice cones engulfed the guard, and then several golden lights shot out from the forest. The golden lights were extremely powerful, clearly the work of late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators. Three consecutive golden lights struck the guard's artifact, sending it flying. Then, ice cones directly pierced the guard. Lu Xu pushed off the ground, rapidly appearing in the clearing, sweeping past the guard's side to collect his storage bag and artifact. Looking at the two confronting individuals, he nonchalantly plundered the guard's body, then directly used a fireball to destroy the corpse without a trace.

This series of practiced movements made Mo Qingchan and the Fourth Prince's eyes twitch. Was it a rogue cultivator?

"Who exactly are you, Your Excellency? Why interfere in our battle? If Your Excellency is willing to withdraw—" The Fourth Prince took a deep breath, suppressing his anger, and spoke to Lu Xu.

But Lu Xu completely ignored him. Instead, he turned to Mo Qingchan and said, "You and I, let's team up and kill this man!"

Mo Qingchan nodded immediately after a brief thought: "Alright!"

"Not good!" The Fourth Prince cursed inwardly and immediately turned to flee into the forest. Two artifacts closely followed, striking towards him. Under the combined efforts of two Qi Condensation Layer 7 cultivators, the Fourth Prince was naturally no match. In just a moment, his artifact was knocked away, and a golden light pierced through his throat.

Dead!

The forest fell silent. In the distance, the terrifying giant curtain of flame had already moved above Weidu (Wei Capital). The Golden Core Patriarch of the Thousand Absolute Sect seemed to be attacking Weidu. The Thousand Absolute Sect's warship also arrived outside Tianmen City, and squads of cultivators emerged, surrounding Tianmen City. It seemed that Emperor Wei and the two Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Wei family had already died.

Lu Xu withdrew his gaze, looked at Mo Qingchan, who was full of vigilance nearby, and asked with a slight smile: "Fairy Qingchan, aren't you leaving yet?"

Mo Qingchan held the Fire Thunder Orb in her hand, her face a little pale; her spiritual energy had also been significantly consumed just now. She parted her red lips slightly, and asked in a somewhat cold voice, "Who exactly are you?"

"Who I am isn't important. What's important is that if you continue to stay here, it will be difficult for us two to have a peaceful conclusion!"

"Is that so?" Mo Qingchan chuckled lightly, "I exerted so much effort to kill these two, and you just want me to leave like this?"

Lu Xu shook his head, "How many spoils of war one obtains isn't decided by who contributed how much effort, but by who retains more strength after the battle!"

Hearing this, Mo Qingchan weighed the Fire Thunder Orb in her hand, her meaning clear without words. As long as she held this powerful killing weapon, she had the confidence to claim a share.

Seeing this, Lu Xu let out a light chuckle. Without saying anything more, he began pulling out talismans from his storage. One, two... ten, fifteen talismans... Seeing Lu Xu produce more and more talismans, Mo Qingchan's expression grew uglier and uglier. Finally, her eye twitched a few times, and without another word, she immediately flew away from the area.

Lu Xu put away his talismans, picked up the Fourth Prince's corpse, and rapidly fled into the distance.
