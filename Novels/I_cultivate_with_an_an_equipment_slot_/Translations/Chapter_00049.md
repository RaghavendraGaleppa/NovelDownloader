# Chapter 49: This Senior Brother Is Too Kind

Apart from mastering the Yin-Yang Harmony Technique, there was also the Minor Achievement in the Pure Yang Virgin Skill.  

Seeing this inscription on the Origin Stele, Zhang Yan was completely dumbfounded.  

How could the Pure Yang Virgin Skill be labeled as a dual cultivation technique?!  

This was utterly ridiculous!  

The Yin-Yang Harmony Technique had actually reached a higher level of mastery than the Pure Yang Virgin Skill.  

He could hardly imagine what the cultivator who carved this Origin Stele had gone through.  

Faced with this, he chose to study it carefully.  

Yes, Zhang Yan selected this Pure Yang Virgin Skill.  

Of course, he didn’t choose it because of any dual cultivation techniques.  

The main reason was that the Pure Yang Virgin Skill itself was an auxiliary technique that could help cultivators refine their spiritual energy.  

At its peak, it could even assist in breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage. However, there was one mandatory requirement for practicing this technique—maintaining virginity.  

This wasn’t a problem for Zhang Yan, as he had already decided to avoid romantic entanglements before reaching Foundation Establishment.  

"This is a great place."  

"But unfortunately, I don’t have that many opportunities."  

The Scripture Pavilion contained numerous techniques and spells, each with its own Origin Stele. These steles were all inscribed with various labels.  

If he wanted to learn these techniques, having the inscribed labels would undoubtedly help him master them quickly.  

However, since studying these required the use of the Origin Steles, the sect had strict regulations on how many times an inner disciple could access them.  

Even though Zhang Yan was a disciple of a Golden Core elder, he could only choose one technique or spell.  

If he wanted to learn more in the future, he would need permission from Zhuge Wan.

After selecting the Pure Yang Virgin Skill, Zhang Yan eagerly took the Origin Stele and left the Scripture Pavilion.  

Upon exiting, he was informed that the Origin Stele could not be taken out of the sect or copied at will. In fact, the stele had already been enchanted with a spell to prevent replication.  

Zhang Yan naturally agreed to these conditions without hesitation.  

He had no intention of copying it anyway.  

Returning to his cave abode, he immediately equipped the stele into his system’s gear slot.  

In an instant, his mind felt as if it had been electrified.  

He instantly grasped the essence of both techniques!  

For example, when Liu Yiting came in to serve him tea, Zhang Yan couldn’t help but assess her based on the knowledge from the techniques in his mind.  

Young.  

Virgin.  

Hidden Attribute: Youthful face with ample bosom.  

Suitable for dual cultivation.  

Feeling these thoughts flood his mind, Zhang Yan slowly raised a question mark at himself.  

---  

This *Yin-Yang Harmony Technique* seemed a bit problematic.  

These thoughts were downright criminal!  

She wasn’t even of age yet, and yet it deemed her "suitable for dual cultivation"...  

"Young Master, are you alright?"  

"Why is your face so red?"  

"Are you feeling unwell?"  

Liu Yiting noticed Zhang Yan’s strange behavior and quickly approached to check on him.  

"N-no, I’m fine. You can leave for now. I’ll call you if I need anything."  

Zhang Yan hurriedly waved her off, took a deep breath, and suppressed the restlessness in his heart.  

Then, he began practicing the Pure Yang Virgin Skill.  

This technique was quite interesting—it had three levels. Each level mastered would produce a strand of Pure Yang energy within the body.  

This energy was incredibly potent, capable of refining spiritual power and aiding in breakthroughs.  

Once nine strands of Pure Yang energy were cultivated, they could merge into a single Pure Yang Essence, slightly increasing the chances of successful Foundation Establishment.  

Just from the description alone, it was clear this was an extraordinary technique.  

Unfortunately, it was also notoriously difficult to master.  

Rumors said that some in the Qingheng Sect had started practicing the Pure Yang Virgin Skill during the early Qi Refining stage but still hadn’t cultivated nine strands even after reaching Foundation Establishment.  

Its difficulty was evident.  

However, this wasn’t a problem for Zhang Yan. Others might struggle, but what did that have to do with him, the cheater?  

The only headache was that this technique required a supporting pill—the Crimson Sun Pill—to practice.  

The Crimson Sun Pill wasn’t expensive or rare, and he could easily purchase it from the sect’s market.  

What truly troubled him was the cultivation of the Yin-Yang Harmony Technique.  

Well…  

Though he currently had no interest in romantic affairs, that didn’t mean he never would. Moreover, such dual cultivation techniques were best mastered as early as possible.  

Unfortunately, this technique required practical experience to cultivate. For now, he could only study it theoretically.  

After instructing Liu Yiting to purchase the necessary pills, Zhang Yan began his cultivation.  

With the aid of the pills and the Origin Stele’s enhancement, his progress in the Pure Yang Virgin Skill was remarkably smooth.  

In just a month, he had mastered the basics and was well on his way to Minor Achievement.  

Even more astonishingly, he had already condensed his first strand of Pure Yang energy.  

With this energy reinforcing his spiritual power, Zhang Yan’s mana became noticeably more refined.  

Even the bottleneck that had stalled him for so long showed signs of loosening.  

This delighted him, and he prepared to redouble his efforts.  

And as luck would have it, good things came in pairs.  

---  

Just as his cultivation showed progress, Elder Liu arrived with news—the spirit herb garden had been completed.  

Though only a little over a month had passed, Zhang Yan felt Elder Liu had aged significantly, his body now exuding an unmistakable aura of decay.  

Elder Liu’s time was running out.  

The elder, however, was at peace with his fate.  

"A Foundation Establishment cultivator’s lifespan caps at two hundred years. But due to differences in cultivation methods and hidden injuries from youth, few live to see that age. I’m already one hundred and seventy."  

"This is a joyous passing."  

Though Elder Liu spoke lightly, Zhang Yan felt a quiet warning in his heart—he must cultivate diligently and pursue the path of immortality.  

Otherwise, even if he reached Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, or even the legendary Nascent Soul stage, he would still end up as a handful of dust.  

Unconsciously, Zhang Yan’s resolve to seek the Dao grew firmer.  

Elder Liu led him to the spirit herb garden.  

The garden was impeccably constructed, surrounded by walls and protected by formations.  

The senior brother from the Hundred Formations Peak was also present, having overseen the garden’s defensive arrays.  

As per Zhang Yan’s request, the formations could regulate temperature, humidity, sunlight, and spiritual energy density.  

"Junior Brother, your money was truly hard-earned!"  

The senior brother had worked tirelessly to complete the formations, but fortunately, he had met all requirements.  

At Zhang Yan’s request, he demonstrated the formations’ functions. After ensuring everything was in order, Elder Liu paid him, and the senior brother left contentedly, handing over a formation control disc.  

According to him, this disc could manipulate all the garden’s formations.  

Taking the disc, Zhang Yan couldn’t help but smile.  

This senior brother was far too kind!
