# Chapter 197: Displaying Ancestral Master-level Foundations

A gentle breeze blew, rippling the mirror-like blue lake. Green bamboo rustled, Tang Jin's beautiful hair danced in the wind, and her flawless, delicate face showed a hint of perturbation.

What was this boy from Black and White Mountain saying?

Tang Jin's eyes were like clear springs, limpid and moving, but now they showed signs of turning into a cold pond. "Who gave you the courage?" she asked indifferently.

The boy from Black and White Mountain was only at the ninth New Life stage, yet he dared to challenge her!

Qin Ming was very calm. "Our New Life path, which has its own share of issues, would be better off gathering dust if we don't have confidence in ourselves," he said. "It's just a spar in the First Realm; what courage do I need?"

Tang Jin was actually extremely powerful, with tangible combat achievements. In the past, the green-clad woman from the Outer Immortal Lands had single-handedly resisted veteran masters and successfully seized Black and White Mountain's greatest fortune. Yet Tang Jin dared to pursue and hunt her down alone, vowing to claim half of that destiny.

Ling Yu immediately lost his composure. He was supposed to be the one issuing the challenge, but this boy from Black and White Mountain had bypassed him, the main contender, to duel with Senior Sister Tang. He said in a deep voice, "You're going too far. Senior Sister Tang possesses innate celestial talent; how could she possibly bully someone younger? Do you know her past? She once ascended the Pure Land, Immortal Land, and Sun Land alone, challenging them single-handedly."

"Older? She's not much older than me," Qin Ming said, though he was still a little surprised. Was that black-clad woman really that formidable?

Tang Jin spoke, "If you duel Ling Yu and win, I will give you the *Blackwater Scripture* and a Flesh and Blood Soul Nourishing Art to fulfill your needs, plus five thousand Day Gold coins." Proud of her status, she wouldn't personally engage Qin Ming. Her beautiful face was like a layer of frost, restoring her aloof and elegant demeanor.

Little Wu spoke up, "Sister Tang, you're being a real penny-pincher here! How much Day Gold did you just shave off my brother's rightful winnings?"

"Can you even speak?" Both Tang Jin and Ling Yu wanted to glare at him.

Little Wu added, "Ah, in the end, Sister Tang, you're just afraid Brother Ling Yu might lose, aren't you?"

Ling Yu suddenly felt a strong urge to fight him!

Tang Jin's expression was calm. "Who carries that much Day Gold for no reason? This is all I have."

"After the Young Ancestor's battle with Xin Youdao, you definitely got a share," Little Wu mumbled.

"It's all been spent!"

Qin Ming smiled and said, "Actually, I'm not interested in Day Gold; a token amount is fine. But the *Dragon Snake Scripture* is indispensable, and the Flesh and Blood Soul Nourishing Art for my brother must be top-tier. As long as these two are met, five thousand or ten thousand Day Gold, it doesn't matter."

Wu Yaozu immediately nodded in agreement. "Right, our desire for Day Gold is very low; asking for too much is too vulgar. We're only interested in cultivation techniques."

Ling Yu squinted at the two of them, barely able to contain himself. These two weren't like this earlier; they were practically extorting money.

Tang Jin frowned. Their lineage had similar cultivation techniques like the *Immortal Butterfly Scripture*, but they genuinely didn't possess the *Dragon Snake Scripture*. "Change to another profound art..."

Qin Ming shook his head. "I follow the path of the Heaven-Propping Ancestral Master, and I need the *Dragon Snake Scripture* to lay my foundation. I also wish to possess the divine strength to prop up the heavens with my bare hands. Since you're asking me for the stakes, it can only be this."

Ling Yu spoke, "Senior Sister, aren't we supposed to be exchanging with the Mountain and River Academy? They have an unreleased version of the *Dragon Snake Scripture*; see if we can exchange for it." It was clear he desperately desired this battle.

Tang Jin had been inclined to give up, but seeing his unresolved frustration, she finally frowned slightly and nodded.

"Actually, there's another very important point I forgot to mention," Qin Ming said again.

"Don't go too far, are you adding more conditions?" Tang Jin was displeased.

Qin Ming said, "Not exactly. You probably already know my identity. I have some grievances with the Cui family, and I originally wanted to study here discreetly. But you've disrupted my peaceful life like this. Without a guarantee, I don't want to participate in such a meaningless duel."

Tang Jin's expression was blank. "Your request is truly... if I spar with you, do we have to protect you afterward?"

"Caw-caw, it's not too bad, I think it's not excessive," the purple-eyed raven flew over. That it would actually speak for the boy from Black and White Mountain made Tang Jin feel a little stifled.

Ling Yu was speechless as well. Was Master Wu siding with outsiders now?

The purple-eyed raven explained, "Think about it, he had integrated well here and was living a peaceful life. Then we came. If we accidentally expose him, his life truly would be in danger. Providing a certain guarantee is only right."

"Whose side are you on?" Tang Jin was a little angry and glared directly at it.

The purple-eyed raven secretly transmitted a message, "Your teacher is building a system of dual-path integration, doesn't he need various prodigies to test his methods? There are some domains where ordinary people simply cannot set foot. If he defeats Ling Yu, it shows that his physique is incredibly exceptional. You could let him try to verify the new methods."

This suggestion made Tang Jin pause. After a moment of thought, she reluctantly agreed.

Ling Yu said, "What profound art do you have? If it's already recorded in our lineage, it's useless."

"*Yimu Scripture*," Qin Ming casually revealed the scripture he had won from the Cui family.

"We don't have that one," Ling Yu nodded. Among wood-element profound arts, they had the *Green Wood Scripture*.

The simple-minded Little Wu scratched his head. "No, brother, is there any point in asking that? You want to win a scripture from my brother? You're thinking too much."

"Why don't we fight first, you and I?" Ling Yu felt that if he didn't beat Little Wu up, he would develop an inner demon.

Tang Jin admonished him, saying, "What kind of behavior is that? Even if the Flying Immortal Mountain in the depths of the Night Mist World collapsed before your eyes, your heart must remain unshaken."

Master Wu said, "Go back and prepare yourselves. Tomorrow, we'll spar on time at Training Ground Number One in the Mountain and River Academy."

"Alright!" Both parties agreed.

Qin Ming said, "Miss Tang, before the duel tomorrow, I hope you will have obtained the *Dragon Snake Scripture*."

Tang Jin's footsteps paused slightly. After taking a deep breath, her figure swayed, and she quickly departed.

Not far away, Qian Chuan didn't dare to breathe. It was his turn to be on duty there, and witnessing this scene firsthand, he felt his heart was about to stop. He couldn't hear the conversation, but he knew why they were there: Ling Yu was going to challenge the previously unknown boy.

"Don't speak carelessly," Tang Jin warned him.

Tang Jun was also in the distance, also privy to the information. Was Young Ancestor Ling Yu really going to challenge that boy? This caused a great shock in his heart.

Little Wu said, "Brother, you raising the stakes at the end is something worth learning from."

Qin Ming shook his head. He truly didn't intend to extort them, but the overall situation necessitated it. Nevertheless, the outcome was good; Master Wu seemed to appreciate him more.

In the evening, Ling Yu's entire body glowed as if countless silver feathers were flying out, accompanied by a vast mist of light, displaying an aura akin to ascending to immortality. Outside his body, streaks of lightning flashed. Then, a pure Yang spiritual light of consciousness emerged, fishing at the surging Heavenlight Qi within him, causing various unusual phenomena to appear. This lineage, with its dual-path advancement, was indeed extraordinary, unmatched in certain domains. Otherwise, even an anomaly who had undergone the nine New Life transformations would find it difficult to manifest such divine phenomena when their Heavenlight was in full bloom.

With a rumble, his body trembled violently, and then an even more powerful aura emerged and erupted. He was stunned, then quickly stood up and said, "Senior Sister, Master Wu, I... I actually broke through to the Second Realm."

Master Wu said, "That's normal. You've consumed Ethereal Bamboo Shoots, entered the Phoenix Nest, and received aid from your teacher, making your foundation incredibly solid. You had already reached a critical juncture, so a natural breakthrough was due."

...

Qin Ming sorted through what he had learned, practiced various profound arts, and circulated his Heavenlight Qi naturally. In the past, when he was at the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, he had already integrated four profound arts and could defeat Lu Zizai's Two Imperials Force, but when Lu Zizai employed the Three Imperials Force, Qin Ming couldn't defend against it. However, Lu Zizai had mentioned that mastering the Three Imperials Force was the limit for the First Realm of the New Life Path. Qin Ming had always demanded the highest standards from himself; he aimed to integrate at least six profound arts during the New Life stage, which would ensure he was not weaker than any Heavenlight Qi. Currently, his Five Elements Profound Art was perfected, and his Golden Cicada Force was initially mastered. If he further acquired the *Dragon Snake Scripture*, he would have seven profound arts mastered during the New Life stage, which should be sufficient.

The next day, Training Ground Number One at Mountain and River Academy was closed. Qian Chuan was speechless. As an insider, he was assigned to stand guard at the gate here! Tang Jun was also helpless. As a famous and powerful Senior Brother in the academy, he had come early to clean the venue, only to be... a mere chore-doer.

Today, some elders were personally coming, showing considerable importance to this matter. There weren't many spectators. Xin Youdao and Cheng Rui had arrived; the former and Ling Yu had become friends after a highly anticipated duel. Then, Master Wu flew in, and Tang Jin also appeared, standing at the edge of the empty training ground. Little Wu was surprised that Zhao Minghui, the middle-aged beautiful woman from the library, also appeared, accompanying two bald old men. Even Tang Jin stepped forward to greet them. The two old men were skinny and bony. Such an aged appearance easily made one think they were venerable elders of the New Life Path. In fact, they were indeed high-ranking figures from the New Life Path side of the Mountain and River Academy. As for the two main contenders, Qin Ming and Ling Yu were already standing in the arena.

Qin Ming couldn't help but look at Tang Jin and Master Wu. Had they brought in outsiders?

One of the two old men nodded and said, "Let us observe your performance. In this Kunling territory, the Cui family and other demons and monsters can't extend their reach here." This could be considered a clear guarantee given to Qin Ming.

Ling Yu spoke, "I have already broken through to the Second Realm, which counts as an Outer Saint, and also places me in the Huangting domain. I will suppress my cultivation to fight you."

Qin Ming shook his head. "There's no need. Use all your strength, unleash your strongest techniques!"

As soon as this statement was made, the spectators outside the arena showed various expressions. Xin Youdao and Cheng Rui were both shocked. Was the initial "nobody" really that arrogant?! Qian Chuan, who was guarding the gate, and Tang Jun, who was doing chores, looked as if they had seen ghosts; their expressions were completely petrified. Was this going to be a cross-realm battle? If it were anyone else, it might be fine, but that was Ling Yu, a Young Ancestor! Even if he lost to that mysterious boy in the First Realm, he had now stepped into the Second Realm, and yet he was still treated so dismissively? Zhao Minghui was also quite surprised. Even the most brilliant person couldn't possibly defeat a Young Ancestor who was so far beyond their realm, could they?

"Truly confident!" Even the faces of the two old men showed ripples of surprise. What great storms hadn't they witnessed? There had always been dazzling prodigies in every era. But someone who could defeat a Young Ancestor-level figure across realms—they had never seen such a thing. "Could there truly be a surprise?" one of the old men showed an expression of anticipation.

Tang Jin also couldn't remain calm. A divine light appeared in her clear spring-like eyes as she gazed at the arena.

"Perhaps he's even stronger than the other one, and perhaps he could even take on two," Master Wu secretly transmitted to her.

"Impossible!" Tang Jin shook her head.

"Just wait and see," Master Wu said, not making any bets with her this time.

"You're truly arrogant!" Ling Yu was provoked. Heavenlight Qi boiled around his body. He was very proud, and only used the power of the First Realm. He instantly moved, a distance of over twenty meters feeling like a mere step. With a whoosh, he appeared before his opponent and slammed a punch towards that figure. At this moment, brilliant multicolored light blossomed in mid-air, as if a propitious celestial phoenix was crying out, its feathers swaying with divine radiance, showering down endless light rain, shaking this entire area!

However, Qin Ming stood rooted to the spot, unmoving. With his left hand behind his back, he merely extended his right hand and pushed it forward.

With a boom, it was as if a heavenly thunderbolt had exploded! The entire Training Ground Number One roared, and the ground trembled continuously. Parts of Ling Yu's black robes burst apart, and his black hair flew wildly backward. He was directly sent flying back over ten meters. After landing, his feet carved terrifying cracks into the azure-gold stone ground.

The scene was silent, everyone utterly stunned. Ling Yu's talent was not just talk; it far surpassed other geniuses! But now...

A discordant voice rang out: "One palm, one thousand Day Gold!" This was naturally Little Wu, because he felt this was Brother Ming's normal performance.

"Use your Second Realm power!" Qin Ming stood still and said calmly. Since everyone present was an insider and elders were there, he believed it was time to display some true ability and demonstrate his astonishing value, so he could gain further recognition, receive convenience, and even obtain the protection of the elders in this territory.
