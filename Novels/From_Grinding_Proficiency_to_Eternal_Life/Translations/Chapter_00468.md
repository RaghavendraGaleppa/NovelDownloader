# Chapter 468: Beidou Ziwei Tiangang

According to some ancient records in the Shenwu Realm, traces of a certain domineering and vicious Tiangang Sha Qi had once faintly manifested at the core star convergence point of this small world.

However, Xu Yunfan understood in his heart that it was difficult to determine whether the phenomenon mentioned in these records was truly the Beidou Pogun Sha Qi, which was born from the Pogun凶星 (Martial Star) and governed slaughter and destruction.

The reason for this ultimately stemmed from the nature of this realm.

The Shenwu Realm was a closed, small界天 (World-Heaven) with a "round heaven and square earth" cosmology.

Although it revealed the stars of the firmament, they were merely illusory reflections of the power of extraterrestrial star systems from a higher plane. The starlight projected here was not the true essence of the stars themselves.

Now that he was protected by the Heavenly Dao of the Shenwu Realm, if he just deduced it a little, he might be able to find the so-called place where the Sha Qi evolved.

However, what made Xu Yunfan somewhat helpless was that whether he could find it was one thing, but whether it even existed was another.

After all, the Shenwu Realm was a small World-Heaven with a "round heaven and square earth" structure, so the power of the stars beyond the heavens was likely difficult to obtain.

He had to make several preparations.

Second best would be the top-tier Sha Qi derived from the Geng Metal origin of the Seven Mansions of the White Tiger in the west.

White Tiger Geng Metal Sha.

The White Tiger in the west governs slaughter. Geng Metal is the hardest and sharpest, containing a desolate and killing aura, and is peerlessly sharp.

This Sha Qi is incredibly pure. Once refined, one's true essence would be as condensed as divine metal, sharp and unstoppable. It could also nourish his True Wu Subduing Demon Sword Art, allowing his sword's edge to be tainted with the supreme sharp metal法则 (Law), enabling him to tear through his enemies with ease.

It represents the ultimate of "rigidity" and "sharpness."

The third choice originates from the Gui Water origin of the Seven Mansions of the Black Tortoise in the north.

Black Tortoise Gui Water Sha.

The Black Tortoise in the north belongs to water. Its nature is extremely Yin and cold, yet also extremely soft and tenacious. Its Sha Qi contains the power of the abyss, governing defense and nourishment. It can carry a boat but also capsize it.

Gui Water is extremely Yin, yet it can give birth to all things. It contains vitality within and possesses immense defensive power, sealing power, as well as erosion and assimilation power.

Choosing this Sha Qi would greatly enhance his tenacity, recovery ability, and his ability to control water and withstand cold, making his Dao Foundation more complete and long-lasting, capable of both attack and defense.

Upon reaching this point in his thoughts, Xu Yunfan sighed.

It was truly a difficult choice. He wanted everything, yet had nothing.

*System, can't you just deliver these things to me? Why do I have to search for them one by one?*

System: "..."

*Does this Shenwu Realm really contain such top-tier Tiangang Sha Qi?*

Although he held doubts in his heart, since the Shenwu Realm was able to 'give birth' to a scripture like the True Wu Subduing Demon Sutra, a scripture that directly points to the roots of Shenwu, it was highly probable that it did exist.

Otherwise, the True Lord of Shenwu would not have stayed in the Shenwu Realm for so long.

Xu Yunfan exhaled and slowly pondered.

These three—the domineering slaughter of Beidou Pogun Sha, the sharp锋芒 of White Tiger Geng Metal Sha, or the enduring tenacity of Black Tortoise Gui Water Sha—are all one-in-a-thousand top-tier Tiangang Disha Qi, each with its own strengths, and all are extremely compatible with the attributes of the *True Wu Subduing Demon Sutra*.

Obtaining any one of them would help him steadily step into the Foundation Establishment mid-stage and greatly increase his strength.

However, in the depths of Xu Yunfan's thoughts, above these three, there was a name that made his heart flutter, a name that was almost legendary.

Beidou Ziwei Tiangang!

The *True Sutra* vaguely mentions that this is the ultimate grade among Tiangang Qi, the true Emperor's Tiangang!

It is not born from an ordinary star, but points directly to the Polar Star in the zenith, the core origin Qi of the Ziwei Enclosure!

The Ziwei Star is the center of the heavens, the master of all phenomena! Its Qi is the "Emperor's Throne" breath, the manifestation at the Qi level of the highest authority that governs the周天 (Myriad) stars and controls the order of the universe!

This kind of Tiangang Qi has already surpassed the category of ordinary "Tiangang Disha." It symbolizes a part of the Great Dao authority, containing the supreme "Polar Star Origin Power in the Zenith."

It represents not only power but also status!

This is a supreme Golden Nature!

It also represents the potential to achieve the Golden Core.

What is particularly crucial is that even with the vast heritage and endless time of the Taihua Lingxu Realm, there are almost no clear records of this Ziwei Tiangang being born or obtained!

Upon reaching this point in his thoughts, Xu Yunfan suddenly understood. It was no wonder that a small World-Heaven like the Shenwu Realm would catch the eye of a True Lord. Perhaps, this place has its own uniqueness.

Because its conditions for birth are extremely harsh, it cannot be naturally born from the creation of this realm. It is highly likely that it needs to be forcibly intervened by a supreme great power from the depths of the extraterrestrial starry sky, snatching it from the origin of the moving Ziwei Emperor Star!

The process is perilous and unpredictable. If one is slightly careless, they will be counterattacked by the Emperor Star's power, resulting in body and soul being destroyed.

Precisely because of this, its preciousness can be imagined. Once refined, it not only grants the user vast magical power, a strong physical body, and a resilient soul far beyond their peers, but it also fundamentally enhances the practitioner's life fortune foundation and Dao Foundation rank, containing a hint of the supreme imperial Dao's might of governance, life and death, and sealing and suppressing.

This is a supreme divine object for forging an eternal Dao Foundation!

Immediately after, a念头 (thought) that was both absurd and logical surfaced in Xu Yunfan's mind.

In the plans of a being like the Qingyuan True Lord, what would be the best "nutrient" if one were to cultivate the "most perfect fruit"?

Would it be just an ordinary top-tier Tiangang Sha?

I'm afraid it wouldn't be qualified!

Only this Ziwei Tiangang, which symbolizes the Emperor Star's origin and can maximally activate the deepest secrets of the *True Wu Subduing Demon Sutra*, is worthy of the Shenwu Realm nursery, which the True Lord has expended such great effort to arrange, and can nurture the ultimate fruit that would even move the True Lord!

If he were to take it himself... no, even if he didn't take it himself, that 'True Lord' would surely find a way to deliver this Tiangang Qi to his doorstep.

*There is definitely one... in the Shenwu Realm now.*

This fragment of information echoed incessantly in Xu Yunfan's mind.

The Shenwu Realm, a mysterious秘境 (Secret Realm) laid out by a True Lord-level existence that can block external perception, is not the best hotbed for hiding and nurturing such a supreme Ziwei Tiangang?

Placing the "bait," the先天金性 (Innate Golden Nature), and the best "accelerator" needed to cultivate the "fruit," the Beidou Ziwei Tiangang, all together!

The grandeur of Qingyuan True Lord's methods and the meticulousness and coldness of his mind are令人不寒而栗 (truly chilling).

He calculated everything. He calculated that Xu Yunfan would come here, calculated that he would choose the True Wu path, and might even have calculated that he would eventually discover the truth but be powerless to resist...

Or perhaps he didn't need to calculate. He just needed to plant the sapling. As long as someone cultivated the True Wu Subduing Demon Sutra and emerged, wanting to take a step further, they would naturally have to return to the Shenwu Realm.

In the end, all of this was just for this Ziwei Tiangang to be absorbed and refined by him, making this "medicinal seedling" grow more "robust and perfect," and finally, when the fruit is ripe, it would be plucked!

Xu Yunfan naturally understood the implication.

How could this be a fortuitous opportunity?

It was clearly poison wrapped in honey, a sweet fruit hanging above a trap!

To eat it meant falling deeper into the abyss of the other's control, elevating his "medicinal properties" to the extreme.

But what if he didn't eat it?

His gaze swept across this golden, oppressive, cage-like land of the Shenwu Realm.
