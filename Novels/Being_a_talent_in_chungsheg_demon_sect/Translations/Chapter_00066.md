# Chapter 66: Digging a Pit

At Vast Heaven Academy, no sooner had Lü Yang left than Ji Xiongying arrived quietly.

"Bookworm, have you met that immortal?"

Upon entering, Ji Xiongying was slightly startled. He hadn't expected Wang Boyuan, who had been full of youthful vigor just a few months ago, to suddenly become so disheveled.

"What happened to you?"

"...Nothing." Wang Boyuan took another gulp of wine and chuckled, "If you're talking about the one you fought, yes, I've met him."

"He was quite interested in my 'Fate-Gazing Art,' which was an honor."

"Stop talking nonsense!" Ji Xiongying sneered, directly throwing the ancient text he'd obtained from his 'adventure' in front of Wang Boyuan. "He can fulfill our grand ambitions!"

"There are immortals in this world, ageless and undying! Kill them, eat their flesh, and you can achieve longevity!" Ji Xiongying declared loudly. "Aren't you aiming to create an era of eternal peace? As long as we kill that immortal, and divide his flesh, we can achieve eternal life and then establish a peaceful world that will never fall!"

"Peaceful world..."

Wang Boyuan murmured softly, but he didn't show the excitement Ji Xiongying had imagined. He merely shook his head, then calmly said, "Then let's try it."

"Good! It's a deal!"

Ji Xiongying noticed Wang Boyuan's unusual attitude, as if he had something on his mind, but he couldn't be bothered to dwell on it. As long as Wang Boyuan was willing to act, that was enough.

Meanwhile, in Tianjing City.

Lü Yang had now regained his composure, as he had suddenly understood something: If it truly were a Foundation Establishment cultivator, there would be no need for such trouble.

This time was different from Skull Mountain.

At Skull Mountain, the hidden True Person Yin Mountain hadn't actually intended to kill him; he had merely used him as bait. But this time was different.

This time, someone clearly wanted to kill him!

The reason they hadn't acted yet was probably because his true body was still hidden within layers of formations, and only an external avatar had been sent to scout.

This indicated that the hidden perpetrator's cultivation definitely hadn't reached Foundation Establishment, because if they were Foundation Establishment, they wouldn't need to be wary; a direct slap would kill him instantly. From this perspective, although the opponent could manipulate karma, their strength was probably only at Qi Refining Grand Perfection.

'Something's strange...'

Able to manipulate karma, but not Foundation Establishment?

One must know that while 'calculating karma' and 'manipulating karma' differ by only one word, they are worlds apart—the watershed between Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining.

Calculating karma only allows for a slight premonition.

Manipulating karma, however, can truly make a situation develop according to one's desires. Logically speaking, only a Foundation Establishment cultivator could achieve such a feat.

Therefore, 'able to manipulate karma, yet not Foundation Establishment' should be impossible.

Unless...

"Foundation Establishment, reincarnated?"

Lü Yang frowned. When all impossible guesses were excluded, the only answer surfaced: "There's a reincarnated Foundation Establishment cultivator in the secret realm!?"

Right, the tribulation of the Sage Thief!

Thinking of this, Lü Yang found it absurd. What was this? His tribulation for achieving great success with the Sage Thief was a reincarnated Foundation Establishment cultivator coming to cause trouble?

It couldn't be that far-fetched, could it?

Heaven above, this humble Daoist has always been benevolent. How could I provoke a Foundation Establishment cultivator—

'...Ah.'

The next second, Lü Yang's eyes suddenly widened.

'Yun Miaozhen, Jade Pivot Sword Sect?'

There were only two Foundation Establishment cultivators in this life who might hold a grudge against him. One was the Peak Master of Mending Heaven Peak, but that person was in their prime and definitely not at the point of needing to reincarnate.

The other was the Jade Pivot Sword Sect.

And given the Jade Pivot Sword Sect's influence, it was quite normal for them to have a reincarnated Foundation Establishment cultivator. Since there was already an old grudge, was it drawn in by the tribulation of the Sage Thief?

It couldn't be that ridiculous, could it?

At this thought, Lü Yang instantly broke out in a cold sweat, so startled he almost immediately wanted to leave the secret realm and report to True Person Yin Mountain that there were bad guys inside...

However, in the end, he held back the urge to leave the secret realm. He suddenly remembered that the last step of the 'Grand Yin Metamorphosis Corpse Liberation True Method' he had previously deduced, the 'Transform After Death' secret art, just happened to lack the soul of a reincarnated Foundation Establishment cultivator to help perfect it.

On the other hand, his Sage Thief cultivation was also not yet complete.

If he reported it now, and True Person Yin Mountain cleared the area, then everything would be lost. Not to mention the Foundation Establishment soul, the Sage Thief would definitely fail.

'Though it's a tribulation, it's also an opportunity!'

As the saying goes, calamity and fortune are intertwined!

Every cause has its effect, and every payback is inevitable. As long as he could overcome this tribulation with his own strength, it would transform into an enormous opportunity!

Moreover, he wasn't without a chance of winning.

Before, the enemy was in the dark and he was in the light; he knew nothing about them, so it was a certain death... But now that he knew the truth, it was different!

He could use their plan against them!

'Since that reincarnated Foundation Establishment cultivator is secretly plotting against me, this so-called Martial Celestial realm was probably also created by him. I knew there was something fishy about it...'

'...He wants to lure me out!'

'And right now, I've only sent out an avatar; he certainly won't be satisfied. That's why Ji Xiongying suddenly appeared and fought me.'

'If I'm not mistaken, he probably has a backup plan. Most likely, he wants to destroy this avatar of mine to lure me out of my secluded cultivation cave and away from the protection of the formations. However, Ji Xiongying is not a match for this avatar of mine. To kill me... he'll have to team up with other Martial Celestials!'

It all made sense! Everything was clear!

Lü Yang's expression remained unchanged, but in his mind, he had already pieced together most of the Yun family ancestor's (implied) scheme. His understanding of karma also deepened subtly.

'This is Foundation Establishment...'

Foundation Establishment cultivators rarely fight to the death. Therefore, most of their moves are made through karma. Whoever can discern the other's karma holds an overwhelming advantage!

'If he wants to kill me, I'll let him!'

Lü Yang pondered for a long time and quickly came up with a countermeasure, because he was actually planning to fight the Martial Celestials himself to bring martial arts back on track.

But not by creating a "fifth step."

On this point, the Yun family ancestor's judgment was very accurate; with Lü Yang's current cultivation and insight, even with the help of the Enlightenment Jade Slip, it would be impossible for him to create a fifth step.

However, to break the deadlock, he didn't actually need to create a new realm. He just needed to make people *believe* he had created a new realm.

After all, the key to the *Sage Thief* lies in 'stealing'.

And to deceive the world and steal fame, one doesn't necessarily need any real substance.

'First, I need a new identity.'

Since he wanted everyone to believe he had created a new realm, he needed to be convincing. For this, a sufficiently prestigious background was essential.

'My true name... Hmm, let's call myself Di Shitian!'

'I have lived for over a thousand years and am the only immortal in this world. I have already reached the limits of this world and am seeking a method to break through.'

'The reason I communicate and battle with Martial Celestials is because I believe that when one's cultivation reaches the extreme of the world, to advance further, one must fight each other, engage in life-and-death struggles, and undergo ultimate sublimation between life and death to break the shackles of heaven and earth!'

'I call this realm "Shattering the Void"!'

'After Shattering the Void, one can gracefully ascend, so no one knows what happened, and no one can describe the profundity of this realm.'

'After all, everyone who reached this realm has not returned, so no one can speak from experience...'

The unknown brings fear, but also hope.

'I don't even need to describe this realm in detail; I just need to have a grand battle and demonstrate it publicly. The rest, they'll fill in themselves...'

This was a grand deception!

The fourth step of martial arts was already a dead end; Foundation Establishment was impossible. But human ambition knows no bounds, and Martial Celestials especially needed a goal to pursue.

And that goal, Lü Yang would give them!

As long as he performed a spectacular show in front of everyone, making the so-called 'Shattering the Void' appear ethereal yet concretely believable.

If no one believes it, it's fake even if true.

If someone believes it, it's true even if fake!
