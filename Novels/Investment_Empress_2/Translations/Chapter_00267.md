# Chapter 267: For You, and to Settle a Score (1/2)

A hush fell over the scene.

No words were needed. As long as she stood there, everyone knew her identity.

The Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan!

Moments ago, the air had been filled with noisy chatter. Now, with her appearance, a deathly silence reigned.

Rumors had it that as an Azure Luan, she also possessed the bloodline of the True Phoenix.

Seeing her in person was far more breathtaking than hearing about her.

Previously, some demons had doubted this, finding it hard to believe. The True Phoenix had vanished for far longer than the True Dragon, dating back to before the founding of the Great Shang Dynasty.

And now, she stood right before their eyes.

Even the proudest demons, those with the noblest bloodlines, felt a sense of inferiority in her presence.

She was too dazzling.

She exceeded even the demons' imagination of the long-lost True Phoenix. Moreover, the divine patterns on her forehead made many demons, especially those of the avian clans, feel an instinctual reverence, a feeling that they were facing a superior being and dared not look directly.

"......"

Ying Bing looked at the youth amidst the horde of demons. He had taken on some features of the Ming Jiao and had slightly altered his appearance, but on his wrist was unmistakably tied that red string.

Actually, no other proof was needed.

When their eyes met, the deep, undeniable tremor in their hearts did not lie...

It was him.

It really was him.

She had specifically told him not to follow her into danger...

Yet, the one who should have been a thousand miles away was now standing before her, completely unprepared.

It felt like a reunion after a long separation, like finding a silver lining after a dark cloud...

No one knew the complex storm of emotions beneath the Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan's frosty, aloof expression.

Shang Qinqing glanced at the young Jiao not far away, then at her clan's Divine Maiden, and couldn't help but cover her heart.

Traveling thousands of miles, infiltrating the demon race, just to find a trace of him?!

This is so good, it's absolutely heavenly!

From the bottom of her heart, Shang Qinqing wished she could see them kissing right now!

Damn it.

Why are there so many demons with so many mouths here? Can't you all just disappear?

Shang Qinqing even harbored the dangerous thought of making them all vanish.

Ying Bing and Shang Qinqing, along with the many Azure Luan clansmen, landed on the ground.

She walked in front, and no demon dared to block her path. Moreover, she kept her gaze straight ahead, not giving a single glance to anything else, including the likes of Zhiduo Luo, who wanted to step forward and get on her good side.

It seemed as if she looked down on everyone, but in reality, her attention was entirely focused on a certain spot not far away.

*Step—*

Ying Bing gently came to a halt.

"Is... is she the Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan?"

The water-demon women surrounding Li Mo shuddered, feeling as if they had reverted to their original forms and were placed on a chopping block, waiting to be slaughtered.

It was terrifying!

The chirping birds... no, the fish and shrimp suddenly scattered.

Thus, nothing stood between the two of them.

"Long have I heard of your reputation. Hello, I am a Jiao from out of town..."

The young Jiao, Li, admitted he was taking a gamble. He had done a bit of disguise and changed his aura. Even Great Demons couldn't see through it, and ordinary demons would have an even harder time. He was confident that even if he stood before his beautiful master, Shang Wu, he wouldn't be recognized.

But apparently...

"You came after all."

Ying Bing's clear and crisp voice rang out softly.

Though a thousand thoughts raced through her mind, what came out was that simple sentence.

*Wait, before the Azure Luan finds her destined one, didn't she have to remain silent?*

The demons were a bit confused.

*Hmm?*

But with her True Phoenix bloodline, it was normal for her to have some extraordinary traits. Besides, just speaking—most demons could speak after transforming.

And!

That wasn't important!

The current situation was a face-off between a peerless young Jiao and the Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan!

A genius from the Water Clan and a genius from the Avian Clan, two natural enemies, were confronting each other directly!

"I feel like sparks are flying between them."

"This is the clash of aura between geniuses, isn't it?"

"I feel like there's something between them that we can't understand..."

"Of course, you can't understand! If you could, you'd be a genius too!"

The demons present all held their breath, watching with a mix of tension and excitement.

Would they start fighting right away?

"What's going on?" a Ming Jiao clansman asked in a low voice, swallowing hard.

"This must be a spiritual confrontation between the strong. Geniuses emphasize aura, making an imposing entrance. Once your aura is suppressed, you'll be at a disadvantage in all future encounters."

Wu Dameng had read this in *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me*.

Everyone nodded, half-understanding but thinking he had a point.

---

Wu Qing and Murong Feng found it strange but remained on high alert.

What if the Avian Clan suddenly launched an attack, trying to crush the Ming Jiao Clan's genius in the cradle?!

This Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan was known for her ruthlessness and coldness, killing countless demons and specifically targeting disaster beasts!

They had to be cautious...

"Well... I came anyway."

Li Mo gave a wry smile. He knew he couldn't hide from her.

"You shouldn't have come."

Ying Bing's eyelashes trembled slightly as she lowered her gaze to the red string on his wrist.

Li Mo laughed heartily. "Weren't you here for me too? It's only natural that I came for you."

He still didn't know what was inside the Divine Phoenix Palace, but since Bing Duo said she was here to fulfill the wish he had made, there had to be a reason for it.

Ying Bing gently stroked the big-headed doll in her arms.

However, this did nothing to quell the tremor in her heart...

The youth's face was just as it had been that day, when he threw himself without hesitation to fall with her into the Qing Abyss!

The Avian Clan: "!"

The Water Clan: "!"

Other passing demons: "!!"

They were at odds, neither willing to back down!

They both knew the other had come for them, yet they still dared to confront each other so fearlessly?

At that moment.

"Amitabha..."

A Buddhist chant came from above. It was a monk in a patched cassock.

A monk appearing here could only be a hospitality monk from the Void Monastery.

Ying Bing snapped back to her senses, composed her emotions, and glanced at the water-demon women who had been surrounding him just moments ago.

Her lips parted slightly, a hint of a smile on her face.

"The Peerless Young Jiao, quite impressive."

"..."

Little Li was caught off guard.

He had imagined meeting Bing Duo, but not in such a seeing this scene.

Seeing his expression, Ying Bing's furrowed brows relaxed slightly.

"During the fight for the Divine Jade, I'll be waiting for you."

Li Mo nodded. "I wouldn't miss it for the world!"

"And..."

"What?"

"I'll settle the score with you then."

"!"

Little Li was struck as if by lightning. He clearly saw the "not smiling" look in Bing Duo's eyes.

I'm done for!

Where did the rumor that he has the True Dragon bloodline even come from?!

"Hmph, just wait until I catch you!"

Li Mo clenched his fist and waved it, looking furious.

The Azure Luan clansmen left the docks. As she passed, Shang Qinqing clicked her tongue at Li Mo before stepping forward to speak with the hospitality monk.

The demons began to enter the Void Monastery in batches.

But they were clearly still immersed in what had just happened and hadn't recovered.

"Achoo! Spectacular, the clash between geniuses was truly spectacular!"

"So exciting!"

"I just got here, what happened?"

"The Avian Clan and the Water Clan have never gotten along. The geniuses of the two clans have clashed!"

"The Ming Jiao Clan's Peerless Young Jiao, Wu Mo, declared that he came here specifically for the Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan!"

"Ah?"

"And how could the Divine Maiden of the Azure Luan be any less? She naturally didn't back down!"

"She told Wu Mo to wait! That she would come to settle a score with him!"

"Wow... it looks like we're about to witness a battle between a Jiao and a Luan!"

For a time, this matter spread rapidly through all the clans, drawing widespread attention. The matter of the Water Clan proposing to Wu Mo was completely forgotten.

Countless demons wanted to know who would ultimately win, who would have the upper hand?

This was a battle between the bloodline of the True Dragon and the bloodline of the True Phoenix! A battle of fate!

How rare! You wouldn't have heard of such a thing even if you went back eight thousand years!

Even the Azure Luan Clan's Clan Head, the former Third-Rank Demon Sage Shang Qinqing, commented:

"If I hadn't separated them a moment later, it would have escalated to physical conflict."

"Perhaps even bloodshed!"

...
