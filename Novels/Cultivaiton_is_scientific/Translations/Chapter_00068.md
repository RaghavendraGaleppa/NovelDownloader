# Chapter 68: Interception  

Li Shiming stood on the deck of the flying vessel, his feet resting on clouds as his gaze swept across the endless expanse of the void before him. The horizon stretched into a distant meeting point between heaven and earth.  

Even in his previous life, he had never witnessed such a sight.  

Whenever he had free time, he would stand on the deck, savoring the rare and breathtaking view.  

This was a privilege of his duty. The thirty youths inside were confined to the first floor, allowed only a designated area for washing. The rest of the time, they had to remain together in a single room.  

It seemed the Tianhai Sect was using this method to teach the youths that the first step in cultivation was enduring isolation.  

The first floor of the flying vessel was heavily protected by formations, keeping the youths away from the deck for their own safety.  

Outside, only a thin barrier of spiritual energy shielded the deck, unable to block the biting wind.  

Mortals would find the deck unbearable—only cultivators with spiritual energy in their bodies could move freely.  

It wasn’t that the flying vessel couldn’t provide better protection for the deck, but doing so would be a waste of energy.  

Li Shiming’s gaze swept across the void ahead when suddenly, an alert sounded from the IBMz15 in his spatial chamber.  

The IBMz15 maintained a constant connection with his five senses, continuously analyzing environmental changes.  

This had become second nature to him, but he hadn’t expected to detect anything unusual while aboard the flying vessel.  

He immediately focused his consciousness into the IBMz15 to examine the anomaly.  

It was a cloud—seemingly ordinary as it drifted through the sky.  

But under the IBMz15’s data analysis, the cloud was moving in a repeating pattern.  

While such phenomena could occur naturally in the world, a cloud performing the same cyclic motion twice in succession was undoubtedly suspicious.  

Li Shiming put on his eyepiece and retrieved a monitoring probe, activating its infrared mode to scan ahead.  

The distance was great, making the infrared readings imprecise, but the abnormal thermal signatures in the sky were enough to confirm his suspicions.  

He stowed the eyepiece and probe, then channeled spiritual energy into the talisman entrusted to him by the sect.  

The flying vessel shuddered violently, coming to an abrupt halt.  

Inside, the youths tumbled like scattered gourds, some even crying out in pain from injuries.  

But Elder Zhao reacted swiftly, appearing beside Li Shiming in an instant.  

"What did you find?" Elder Zhao asked sternly.  

He didn’t believe Li Shiming was acting recklessly. Over the past days, Li Shiming had proven himself mature and capable, working seamlessly with the other two Qi Refinement disciples to fulfill their duties.  

At that moment, Senior Brother Ma and Senior Brother Wu rushed out, their gazes also fixed on Li Shiming, awaiting his explanation.  

"Elder Zhao, I noticed something strange about that cloud over there," Li Shiming said, pointing into the distance.  

Elder Zhao studied the distant cloud. At first glance, nothing seemed amiss, but with Li Shiming’s warning, he quickly detected the anomaly.  

"You did well, Li Shiming. Return inside for now," Elder Zhao said, his eyes sharp as he stared into the distance.  

Just as Li Shiming was about to retreat, five figures burst forth from the void ahead.  

The cloud and the surrounding sky rippled before vanishing, as if nothing had been there.  

But it was clear—someone had laid a trap in the void, waiting for them to pass through.  

Li Shiming’s timely discovery had thwarted their plan, forcing them to reveal themselves.  

Elder Zhao showed no surprise. He soared into the air to confront the approaching cultivators.  

Senior Brother Ma and Senior Brother Wu exchanged glances—one summoned a flying sword, the other a paper crane—before following.  

Li Shiming, unable to fly, didn’t retreat into the vessel as instructed. Instead, he stayed to observe the battle.  

Hiding inside would be pointless. If Elder Zhao and the others lost, the fate of him and the youths would rest in the hands of these unknown cultivators.  

"How did the Netherdark Sect learn of this route?" Elder Zhao demanded as he approached the five figures.  

Their flight path had been carefully planned to avoid conflict with the Netherdark Sect.  

Without precise intelligence, the sect wouldn’t have dispatched a Foundation Establishment cultivator and four late-stage Qi Refinement experts to intercept them.  

"Keh keh keh... You needn’t know, for you won’t be returning—nor will the disciples aboard your vessel. They’ll join the Netherdark Sect!" the opposing Foundation Establishment cultivator cackled, his voice grating like metal scraping stone.  

Even from a distance, the sound made Li Shiming’s skin crawl.  

He saw Senior Brother Ma and Senior Brother Wu sway unsteadily. Had Elder Zhao not shielded them with two quick spells, the sheer malice in that laughter might have sent them plummeting from the sky.  

Li Shiming had never encountered such an eerie ability. He recorded the sound, analyzing how to counter it.  

Connected to the IBMz15, his thoughts raced. In an instant, he formulated a possible solution.  

He retrieved a recording of the "Great Compassion Mantra" from the IBMz15 and played it through his senses.  

The sound was for his ears alone, inaudible to others.  

Whether it was the mantra’s effect or the IBMz15 occupying most of his sensory processing, the discomfort faded.  

Though the cackling persisted, it no longer affected him.  

"Thinking I won’t return? Do you realize this is Tianhai Sect territory? Did you ever consider you might be the one who doesn’t make it back?" Elder Zhao laughed, unfazed. His booming voice neutralized the eerie laughter, easing the pressure on his disciples.  

"Bold words! I thought Tianhai Sect was full of cowards. It seems I’ll have to teach you a lesson today!" the opposing cultivator snarled, his killing intent flaring.  

"Senior Brother Dai, come out and greet this Netherdark fiend with me!" Elder Zhao called toward the vessel, ignoring the taunt.  

"Junior Brother Zhao, I was hoping to watch you handle him alone. Seems you’re eager to return," a voice replied as a figure shot into the sky from the vessel, riding a sword beam.  

Only then did Li Shiming realize Elder Dai had been aboard all along.  

This wasn’t just a mission to retrieve new disciples—it was a trap for the Netherdark Sect.  

Otherwise, a simple retrieval wouldn’t warrant two Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

As bait, Li Shiming and the thirty youths had no say in the matter. Their fates rested entirely in the hands of the Tianhai Sect cultivators. All they could do was hope the sect would resolve the threat swiftly.
