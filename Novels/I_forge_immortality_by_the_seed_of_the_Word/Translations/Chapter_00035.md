# Chapter 35: First Visit to the Thousand Techniques Pavilion  

A flash of light filled Zhang Jing's vision.  

The next moment, he found himself standing on a long street that stretched as far as the eye could see. He turned around to look behind him—the massive cyan-gold gate stood silently in place.  

*Is this the concept of a mustard seed containing a universe, or was I teleported here?* Zhang Jing wondered in confusion. From the outside, the Thousand Techniques Pavilion had seemed far too small to house such an expansive street.  

His gaze instinctively swept forward.  

The first shop on the left was a recycling center for rare treasures and demonic materials, where a few people stood scattered about. The one at the front was arguing with the person behind the counter. Right next to it was a shop selling talismans.  

Zhang Jing's eyes lit up, and he immediately walked in.  

As soon as he entered, a senior sister approached him with a sweet smile.  

"Junior Brother, are you here to buy talismans? You've come to the right place. The talismans sold here are all crafted by the senior brothers of the Inner Court, and their quality is top-notch. They might be a tad expensive, but they're absolutely worth it."  

"Ah, Senior Sister, I'm not here to buy talismans," Zhang Jing replied.  

Hearing this, a flicker of disappointment flashed in the senior sister's eyes, but she maintained her smile and said gently,  

"Junior Brother, we only accept top-quality talismans here."  

"Ahem, well, Senior Sister, I was just looking around," Zhang Jing said awkwardly.  

"Then let me show you around," the senior sister offered cheerfully.  

"Thank you, Senior Sister." Zhang Jing cupped his hands in gratitude.  

Under her guidance, Zhang Jing walked straight to a crystal display case on the far right.  

"Junior Brother, these are all top-quality talismans."  

Zhang Jing looked at the display.  

Talismans emitting strong spiritual energy fluctuations lay quietly inside, each labeled with its type, name, and—most importantly—its price.  

*Shadow Wind Talisman* – Low-grade offensive talisman – 1.5 Dao Merits.  
*Sealed Sword Talisman* – Low-grade offensive talisman – 1.5 Dao Merits.  
*Luminous Shield Talisman* – Low-grade defensive talisman – 2 Dao Merits.  

The moment he saw the prices, Zhang Jing instinctively slowed his breathing.  

Among the low-grade talismans, defensive types were the most expensive, while offensive ones were the cheapest. Yet even the cheapest offensive talisman cost 1.5 Dao Merits.  

This was far more expensive than he had expected.  

After all, no matter how high the quality, a low-grade talisman was essentially just an instant-cast low-grade spell. Any disciple in the Dao Academy could cast a low-grade spell in three to five breaths—or even one or two breaths for the faster ones.  

However, if timed correctly, a single talisman could easily turn the tide of battle.  

Moreover, multiple talismans could be activated simultaneously.  

Realizing this, Zhang Jing understood just how important talismans were for ordinary cultivators—especially for disciples who frequently went on missions outside the academy.  

His thoughts then turned to his *Five Elements Spirit River*.  

That was far more powerful than any talisman.  

Meanwhile, in the short time Zhang Jing had been lost in thought, three more people had entered the shop to buy low-grade talismans—and not just one or two. Each purchased dozens at once.  

Seeing this, Zhang Jing nodded slightly.  

It seemed there was no shortage of demand for talismans once they were made.  

He continued forward.  

*Blazing Ember Talisman* – Mid-grade offensive talisman – 12 Dao Merits.  
*Golden Armor Talisman* – Mid-grade defensive talisman – 18 Dao Merits.  

The price of mid-grade talismans was nearly ten times that of low-grade ones.  

And yet, they were still selling well.  

Suppressing his astonishment, Zhang Jing pressed on until he reached the high-grade talisman display.  

*Divine Gold Arrow Talisman* – High-grade offensive talisman – 110 Dao Merits.  
*Condensed Dew to Rain Talisman* – High-grade special talisman – 90 Dao Merits.  
*Three Powers Binding Talisman* – High-grade special talisman – 150 Dao Merits.  
*Jade Mist Radiance Talisman* – High-grade defensive talisman – 180 Dao Merits.  

Zhang Jing froze in his tracks, his eyes widening in shock.  

High-grade talismans were absurdly expensive.  

A single talisman cost over a hundred Dao Merits—some even close to two hundred. What did that mean?  

If he, Zhang Jing, could produce around fifty high-grade talismans and sell them, the Dao Merits he earned would be enough to exchange for a high-grade inheritance!  

For Zhang Jing, with the proficiency bonuses from his Jade Talisman skill, crafting high-grade talismans was only a matter of time.  

Moreover, he had already checked—the *Nine Transformations Spirit Star Talisman Method* recorded the crafting techniques for three types of high-grade talismans.  

Even if his current cultivation level prevented him from making high-grade talismans in the short term, selling mid-grade talismans alone would likely allow him to accumulate nine thousand Dao Merits.  

It would just take about nine hundred mid-grade talismans.  

*Haa—*  

Zhang Jing exhaled deeply and turned to leave.  

He had a good grasp of talisman prices now.  

Next, he needed to buy materials, craft the talismans, and then bring them back here to set up a small stall—just like the senior brothers and sisters he had seen outside.  

As soon as he stepped out the door, a senior brother with a fervent gaze locked onto him.  

"Junior Brother, I see you didn't buy anything inside. Were the talismans too expensive? Come over here—my talismans are cheaper."  

Before Zhang Jing could respond, the senior brother had already pulled him over to a small stall.  

"What do you think? Cheaper, right?" the senior brother said confidently.  

*Cheaper?*  

Zhang Jing looked at the low-grade talismans on display. Honestly, they weren't much cheaper—maybe twelve talismans here for the price of ten inside.  

But he also noticed that the spiritual energy fluctuations from these talismans were slightly weaker.  

*A difference in quality?*  

If quality was factored in, it was hard to say which was truly the better deal.  

"These are still quite expensive, Senior Brother. Can you lower the price?"  

Out of curiosity, Zhang Jing tried bargaining.  

"Sorry, Junior Brother," the senior brother said with a bitter smile. "If you don't craft talismans yourself, you might not understand. There's a failure rate involved. At my current level, this is already the lowest price I can offer—any lower, and I'd be losing money."  

"Then I'll keep looking, Senior Brother."  

Zhang Jing smiled and declined.  

The senior brother's expression instantly turned cold. "Suit yourself."  

"Farewell."  

Zhang Jing turned and left.  

Not far away, he heard the sound of an argument. Looking back, he saw a senior sister standing at the same stall, quarreling with the senior brother. Moments later, she angrily bought two talismans before storming off.  

Zhang Jing then entered a shop selling talisman-making materials.  

A short while later, he emerged and headed back toward the giant gate.  

Looking at his now-depleted Dao Merits—less than a hundred remained—Zhang Jing felt his heart bleed.  

Spirit ink was expensive. Spirit brushes were expensive. *Everything* was expensive!  

A single mid-grade spirit brush cost a staggering 180 Dao Merits, and a portion of spirit ink was 10 Dao Merits. The blank talisman paper for low-grade crafting wasn't too bad—10 Dao Merits for a hundred sheets—but he had just bought five hundred sheets in one go.  

Outside the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, Zhang Jing found his spirit crane among the flock and mounted it.  

With a powerful beat of its wings, the crane soared into the sky, carrying him away.
