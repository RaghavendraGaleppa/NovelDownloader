# Chapter 56: Investing in Jiang Chulong, the Strange Princess

Golden Destiny!

Aside from the Ice Cube, this was the highest Destiny he had encountered so far.

He looked at the data displayed by the Destiny Divine Eye, then at the little beggar lying there, her breath as faint as a thread. The contrast between the two was far too great.

Confirming he wasn't seeing things, Li Mo stood frozen on the spot as if struck by lightning.

The youngest daughter of the Emperor of the Yu Dynasty!

A Innate Sword Constitution!

The two descriptions echoed in Li Mo's mind, yet he still couldn't quite snap out of his shock.

Although Jiang Chulong possessed a Golden Destiny, which was slightly inferior to the Ice Cube's, the shock she brought him was no less significant.

He didn't know how many experts existed in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, but in terms of status and identity, who could compare to the Son of Heaven?

It was no wonder.

Even after falling to such a境地 (state/situation), Jiang Chulong was still able to maintain her Golden Destiny.

If it were anyone else, it would be considered good fortune if they hadn't died from being plagued by misfortune.

"She... must be the person the Ice Cube is looking for!"

Li Mo became almost certain of this in his heart.

He also realized that what the Ice Cube wanted him to find wasn't some lost friend or relative. Rather, she must have seen Jiang Chulong at some point and knew of her extraordinary nature, which was why she had sent him to find her.

"Brother Li, what's wrong?"

Meng Can looked up and asked with some confusion.

The other little beggars also looked over with expressions ranging from curiosity and hope to fear.

"Ice Cube, if you were here, I'd definitely kiss you..."

Li Mo retracted his burning gaze.

It made sense that extraordinary, outstanding figures would gather around a woman of Destiny.

"Brother Li, is Sister Stutterer very sick?"

Meng Can thought Li Mo was shocked by the Stutterer's condition, his small face full of worry.

"Let me take a look first."

Li Mo suppressed the surging emotions in his heart and walked into the dilapidated house.

He placed his hand on Jiang Chulong's frail wrist and closed his eyes to sense her condition.

Weak Qi and blood... internal organs with failing vitality... severe cold... wound infection... severe malnutrition due to long-term hunger...

Right now, Jiang Chulong was like a tattered rag doll with holes in it; a single fall could cause her to fall apart.

If it were anyone else, they would have died long ago.

But Jiang Chulong's situation was strange. Whenever her life flame was like a candle in the wind, on the verge of extinguishing, some inexplicable force would pull her back forcefully.

"Sister Stutterer, what illness does she have?"

A cautious inquiry came from his ear.

Li Mo also lowered his voice and said gently:

"Her condition is rather complicated."

"But, she can be cured."

A Golden Destiny, without the black color of a looming death omen.

Even if he didn't intervene, Jiang Chulong wouldn't die, but she would still have to endure a long struggle.

After a moment of thought.

Li Mo took off the Fire Sparrow Feather Pouch hanging from his chest, pried open her fingers, and stuffed it in.

"She can't withstand medicinal supplements right now."

"This pouch can nourish her body. We can only proceed with medicine once her body is better."

Miraculously, as soon as the Fire Sparrow Feather Pouch touched her, Jiang Chulong's breathing became slightly stronger.

She no longer sweated cold sweat constantly like before.

At the same time.

Feedback notifications from the system sounded in Li Mo's ears.

【Congratulations, Host, for investing a 'Fire Sparrow Feather' in 'Jiang Chulong'.】

【Investment Feedback: Earth Vein Spirit Milk.】

【Would you like to claim it?】

"No."

Li Mo silently thought in his heart, then looked to the side.

"Sister Stutterer is saved!"

"Brother Li, your medical skills are amazing!"

"Abababa."

The little children revealed expressions of joy, as if they had found their backbone again.

After exchanging glances, the oldest little beggar ran outside.

When he returned, he was holding a piece of yellow salt in his hand, his head almost buried in his chest.

"Brother Li, we don't have money..."

"So you're planning to treat me to a meal?"

Li Mo couldn't help but smile.

Looking at the handsome young man dressed in fine clothes like clouds, and then at the broken clay pots outside stewing wild vegetable soup with clear water, the little beggars became even more at a loss.

---

Meng Can had only ever seen the most impressive people were the constables patrolling the streets with swords, yet just now, he had witnessed with his own eyes that the imposing constable master didn't even dare to look Brother Li in the face, acting extremely humble.

The food they usually ate, even stray dogs would disdain, how could they serve it to Brother Li...

"This wild vegetable is a good thing, pure natural and pollution-free."

"I don't usually get to eat this."

As he spoke, Li Mo walked over to the clay pot.

He added a suitable amount of rice into it, and somehow, a piece of meat appeared in his hand, which he easily turned into minced meat with a light rub.

"I'm not used to not cooking for two days."

The little beggars were all a bit stunned.

They never expected this big brother's style to change so suddenly, becoming so down-to-earth.

He actually started cooking with a relaxed expression.

"Brother Li, do you often cook personally at Qingyuan Sect?"

"Yes, the food in the cafeteria is terrible."

"Brother Li, what are you making? It smells so good..."

"Wild vegetable and lean meat porridge. Joking, my cooking skills are much better than my medical skills."

Li Mo smiled.

He had secretly added a Five Elements Purple Spirit Pill inside.

It was a precious product for replenishing the body's deficiencies, and the medicinal effect was mild, so even ordinary people who hadn't tempered their bodies could take it.

A single ordinary one could sell for five thousand taels of silver in a merchant's guild.

Let alone his, which was a six-pattern one.

Of course, for Li Mo, this wasn't anything rare.

...

Not long after.

Smoke began to rise from the cooking fires in the dilapidated courtyard.

"I've never eaten anything this good in my life."

"Abababa!"

"I'm so full."

"Wuuwuu, I miss Mom..."

Li Mo was not far away, watching them drink the porridge with a silent smile on his face.

【Name: Da Zhu】

【Age: 8】

【Physique: None.】

【Realm: None.】

【Destiny: Grey】

【Evaluation: Like a wild weed, life as light as a feather.】

【Recent Experience: With Jiang Chulong's help, he escaped the clutches of the slave traders and no longer lives by stealing.]

This investment didn't bring any substantial return.

After all, these little beggars all had destinies similar to Da Zhu's.

But Li Mo was in a good mood.

*Step—*

Footsteps suddenly came from behind.

Li Mo turned his head.

He saw the beggar girl with her eyes bandaged standing there, leaning against the door frame.

He couldn't see her eyes, but he could clearly sense that her gaze right now was very guarded.

"You... it's you..."

"Yes, I made the food, and I gave you the pouch."

Li Mo answered preemptively.

"Why..."

*Gurgle—*

Jiang Chulong didn't even finish her sentence when her legs went weak, and she almost collapsed and fainted.

"You should eat first."

"You can't worry about anything else with an empty stomach."

Li Mo was speechless yet amused.

He could understand Jiang Chulong's caution.

After fleeing all the way and being pursued by the Patrol Sky Guards, anyone would be like a startled bird.

"Th... thank you..."

Jiang Chulong bit her lips and finally nodded.

A moment later, she returned with a bowl of porridge, the last bit left in the clay pot.

"You... you eat first..."

The stuttering voice was very pleasant to hear, making her sound pitiful and delicate.

Li Mo: "..."

This left Li Mo a bit confused.

Wait, you're so hungry you can't even stand steadily.

And you're still worried that I haven't eaten?

Just what is this Princess thinking...
