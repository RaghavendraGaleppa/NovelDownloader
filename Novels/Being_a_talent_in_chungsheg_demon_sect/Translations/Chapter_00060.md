# Chapter 60: Every Cause Has Its Effect

Time flew, years passed like shuttles.

In the blink of an eye, another thirty years had gone by. When Lu Yang opened his eyes again, although his face showed no signs of aging, a streak of white had appeared in his once thick black hair.

"In the blink of an eye, I'm already eighty years old..."

Qi Refinement cultivators live longer than mortals, but only up to 150 years, not significantly more. At eighty, he was already past middle age. In another twenty years, Zhao Xuhe's Heaven Stealing Secret would unlock.

"Although there's no hope for Foundation Establishment in this life, once I master the Saint Stealing Art, I can certainly attempt Foundation Establishment once to gain experience in advance." The Great Dao was in sight, the Great Dao was in sight.

Even for the 'Taiyin Corpse Transformation True Art', after thirty years of secluded study, he had successfully devised a clever secret method with the help of the Enlightenment Jade Slip.

"To truly cultivate the 'Taiyin Corpse Transformation True Art', one must undergo 'death before transformation'. However, if I die, the Myriad Lives Scroll will reactivate... But in reality, this 'death' isn't absolute; the 'Taiyin Corpse Transformation True Art' can't truly kill the cultivator."

"The so-called 'death' is actually limited to the physical body. After the body dies, it is refined underground; nails and hair grow long, the corpse resembles a living being, and over time, one achieves the Dao... It's just that for others, when the body dies, they are truly dead."

"After all, the physical body is the vessel for the soul; once the body dies, the soul will gradually dissipate, and death is only a matter of time."

"However, conversely, as long as I keep my soul conscious while letting my physical body die, preventing the soul from dying, the Myriad Lives Scroll won't be triggered. This way, there might be an opportunity for 'death before transformation'."

This was the solution provided by the Enlightenment Jade Slip, and Lu Yang felt it was highly feasible. The only issue was the clever secret method he had created for this purpose.

"Although the Enlightenment Jade Slip's deduction suggests this secret method is enough to keep my soul stable and undissipated after the physical body dies, I've never seen a soul that truly exists independently of the body. If I could observe one, record the data with the Enlightenment Jade Slip, then the secret method would be complete..."

More importantly, Lu Yang knew such beings existed in this world: Foundation Establishment True Lords!

Foundation Establishment True Lords have a lifespan of three hundred years, but this is only the lifespan of their physical body; the lifespan of their soul is far greater. Therefore, they often choose reincarnation after death. Although everything restarts for a Foundation Establishment True Lord after reincarnation, and their cultivation realm drops below Foundation Establishment, they are not afflicted by the 'mystery of the womb' (amnesia from reincarnation). They are bound to awaken memories of their past lives before the age of eight, and thereafter, their cultivation progresses at a thousand miles a day. As long as they can regain the Foundation Establishment realm, they can once again obtain a three-hundred-year lifespan.

Of course, this cannot continue indefinitely. Each reincarnation is a wearing down of their accumulated achievements. If a Foundation Establishment True Lord's Dao cultivation doesn't increase, they will only become weaker and weaker.

A first reincarnation will certainly result in a heaven-blessed prodigy. A second reincarnation can still produce a dragon among men. A third reincarnation will yield an ordinary genius. By the fourth or fifth reincarnation... if the True Lord's cultivation has not improved, they will completely fade into mortality, losing their former transcendence.

This is known as: The True Lord's Fruit is severed after five generations.

Moreover, there's no guarantee they can regain Foundation Establishment after reincarnation. Once a True Lord reincarnates, if they cannot suppress their destiny, past karmic debts will come one after another. It's quite common for them to perish prematurely if they're not careful. Therefore, every True Lord is extremely cautious when reincarnating, concealing heavenly secrets and rarely informing outsiders, lest they accidentally incur karmic tribulations.

Under such circumstances, how difficult would it be to encounter the reincarnated soul of a Foundation Establishment True Lord?

Thinking of this, Lu Yang immediately felt another headache. He had no choice but to temporarily set it aside and instead began to divine whether his grand mission of spreading cultivation arts had made any progress.

"'Supreme Purity Imperial Edict, Heaven's Amnesty!'" Lu Yang chanted a spell, his fingers forming seals. The Supreme Purity Imperial Edict divined heavenly secrets, and his consciousness quickly sank into the ubiquitous karmic net of the heavens and earth, beginning a keyword search. Soon, corresponding information appeared in his mind:

"In the waning years of the Great Zhou Dynasty, a tyrannical emperor ruled, plunging the populace into misery. Consequently, a Heavenly Scripture appeared, divided into four scrolls, scattering across the human realm, immediately stirring forth hidden dragons throughout the land."

"When the chaos was quelled, the four scrolls of the Heavenly Scripture found their owners. One scroll was held by the Vast Righteousness Academy, passed down and copied by scholars through generations. One scroll was acquired by the Hanging Temple, becoming the highest scripture of Buddhism. One scroll was annotated by the Celestial Master's Mansion, serving as the artifact of successive Celestial Masters. Only the last scroll fell into the mortal world, its whereabouts unknown."

"Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism – these three schools collectively divided the world, becoming the source of the martial arts of their era!"

"Excellent, excellent!" Lu Yang's face showed pleasant surprise. He immediately activated the Saint Stealing Art. The next second, he felt a powerful surge of qi flow sweep over him, instantly engulfing his body. In an instant, Lu Yang's body explosively shattered.

Yet, miraculously, after his body shattered, it didn't turn into flesh and blood, but transformed into countless specks of dust filling the air. Lu Yang's consciousness resided at the very center of these dust motes. He could feel every single speck of his physical body being burned and refined by the qi flow. "Human worldly essence, refine the Saint's Golden Body!"

After a long while, until the powerful qi flow was completely consumed, the dust motes re-converged, then re-manifested into Lu Yang's physical form. However, this time, his body had undergone an earth-shattering transformation.

"The Saint Stealing Golden Body has reached Minor Completion!" A sharp glint flashed in Lu Yang's eyes. Then, he lifted his foot and stomped. In an instant, a terrifying ripple-like wave, powerful enough to shake mountains, explosively spread out! Under the impact of this horrific wave, Lu Yang's cliffside cave abode seemed to have undergone an earthquake, with rocks rolling down. It was as if an invisible storm was raging. Countless ferocious birds and beasts were startled, looking towards the peak where Lu Yang had been in seclusion, then flying away in panic.

"Feels quite good." Lu Yang exhaled deeply, feeling for the first time the sensation of 'solidity' from his body. Now, he could probably match a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator just with his physical body alone!

However, the next second, his expression turned solemn.

"According to Senior Brother Luo's experience, the Saint Stealing Art uses the people of the world as nourishment, severely damaging one's merits. Minor Completion might allow one to muddle through, but Major Completion will inevitably invite tribulations."

"Many who cultivated the Saint Stealing Art failed at the last hurdle precisely because of these tribulations. If they were lucky, they could save their lives; if unlucky, like that true disciple who was counter-killed by a native of the secret realm, they would die an unnatural death. 'But now that I'm operating from behind the scenes, who in this secret realm could become my tribulation?'"

Thinking of this, Lu Yang fell into contemplation.

***

Jiangnan, Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion.

Yun Zhiqiu stood on a pavilion. However, compared to his vigorous appearance sixty years ago, he now looked like an old man on the verge of death.

Just then, a flying message shot through the air. Yun Zhiqiu took the message and read it, his expression instantly changing drastically. He immediately conjured a streak of flight and, in a short while, arrived at the Cloud family's ancestral home.

As soon as he entered, a pale-faced young man came out. Upon seeing Yun Zhiqiu, he cried loudly, "Grand-uncle! The Ancestor... he's close to the end! To see you one last time, he's already lit the Seven-Star Lamp. Once the lamp goes out, he'll surely reincarnate. There isn't much time, please go in and see him quickly!"

"How could this be!" Upon hearing this, Yun Zhiqiu's face revealed a sorrowful, panicked expression.

Besides sorrow, there was also panic.

The Cloud Family Ancestor, the Cloud family's only Foundation Establishment True Lord at present, the pillar of the Cloud family in the Sword Pavilion for hundreds of years, had actually reached the end of this life!
