Chapter 93: The Novel is Now Paywalled!

On March 7, 2025, the book officially entered the paywalled subscription phase.

It is a pity that it did not make it onto the "Three Rivers" recommendation list.

I will work hard to update more chapters in the next two months, striving to write ten thousand words a day. I hope everyone can continue to support me.

If you still find the story unsatisfying, I recommend two books written by friends of mine: *I Awakened a Proficiency Panel at the Start* and *Daoist Master Seeks Long Life*.

Finally, I sincerely ask for your subscriptions. Thank you all!
