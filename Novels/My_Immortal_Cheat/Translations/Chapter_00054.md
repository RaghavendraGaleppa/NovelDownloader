Chapter 54: A Master!

The ten-thousand-zhang long divine spear almost tore through the entire arena space. All the runes etched onto its shaft glowed with divine radiance, and a faint, indistinct phantom appeared, incredibly ethereal, its features unclear. This phantom grasped the Saint Spear, an imprint left by the spear's true owner, now activated.

Tian Ling's petite figure was locked by a terrifying aura, unable to move. Under the colossal divine spear, she was as minuscule as an ant. This was a Saint's strike; she was merely an Earth Treasury Realm cultivator, utterly incapable of resisting.

She felt her body frantically sending warnings. The Saint Sword in her hand trembled incessantly, scattering arcs of lightning, attempting to rouse her. But alas, her cultivation was too low; without energy support, even the Saint Sword was powerless to aid her. The Saint-King artifact Zhou Yu had given her also vibrated, but without an energy supply, it was merely an ornament!

Azure runes surged across her body. Tian Ling strained with all her might, managing only to slightly turn her neck, and the direction was precisely toward Zhou Tian's VIP room. She didn't know what she was thinking. In this final moment, her heart held no superfluous thoughts of fear or despair. She just wanted to turn her head and look. But it seemed even this last small wish couldn't be fulfilled…

The Saint Spear moved. The phantom holding it gently thrust forward. Overwhelming Blazing Li Fire enveloped the sky, phoenixes soaring and dragons rising. The arena space was torn apart like a rag, its target precisely Tian Ling, who had long been locked down.

Everyone in the VIP rooms watched this scene, their expressions varied. Zhou Tian clenched his fists, veins bulging, his face grim. The others also watched the spectacle in the arena, but the one emotion missing from their gazes was worry…

Tian Ling could already feel the Blazing Li Fire searing her. Just at this last moment…

Boom! Boom!

A vast and ancient aura descended. An incredibly enormous hand tore through space, shimmering with purple light. Each finger was ten thousand zhang long, its palm lines lifelike. Chaotic energy surged, and endless rune chains coiled around it. Just like that, it forcefully broke open the arena space.

After entering the space, the giant hand immediately sealed it. All the runic divine chains on the colossal palm shot towards the Saint Spear, then dragged it towards itself. The purple giant palm grasped the Saint Spear, and arcs of runes shot towards Tian Ling, forming a shield to protect her. Then, the giant hand clenched forcefully.

Crack!

A crisp sound echoed. Cracks appeared on the Saint Spear's body, and it completely disintegrated. The giant hand had actually crushed the Saint Spear!

The giant hand dissipated, and a silver-haired old man appeared in its place. With a wave of his hand, runes surged, and the utterly destroyed arena space instantly restored to its original state.

Upon seeing the old man appear, the audience erupted in an uproar, murmuring among themselves. It had been a long time since anyone had interfered with a competition. The entire Futian State was also in an uproar, as the competition was being broadcast live across the whole state via a miraculous formation.

"What are you doing?"

In the backstage area of the competition venue, the person in charge stopped someone who was about to stand up, asking in a low voice.

"That person interfered with the competition! Naturally, I'm going to stop him!" The person spoke righteously, his eyes full of passion.

"Are you an idiot? Don't you recognize that person? He's Prince Qin's Estate's butler! And have you ever seen someone exchange their life for victory in the Youth Grand Competition?" The person in charge roared. He had originally thought highly of this young man for his drive, but now it seemed his mind wasn't quite right. "Now we have no place to interfere. Just watch. Also, prepare a recording of this match; it might be useful!"

The person's lips twitched. He looked at the grim face of the person in charge and lowered his head, backing down.

No one in the VIP rooms showed any surprise, as if they had long expected it.

"Emperor Realm, ah…" General Gu Feng of West Frontier sighed, his eyes revealing a longing expression.

"After waiting for so long, the real show has finally begun!" General Wei Yan of South Frontier licked his fangs.

Zhou Tian let out a breath of relief. Although Uncle Zhou was someone he had already arranged, the scene just now still made him break out in a cold sweat, fearing some unexpected mishap. But he had overthought it; after all, Uncle Zhou, as a Great Emperor, saving someone from a Saint artifact wouldn't lead to any accidents.

Standing up from his seat, Zhou Tian spoke to the others in the room. "Everyone, it's my turn to enter the stage!"

"Our mastermind is finally going to reveal himself…" Zhou Zui teased, and the others also nodded.

"Liu Yan, he likes you, and every night he fantasizes about your projection!" Zhou Tian ignored Zhou Zui, speaking directly to Liu Yan. After saying that, his figure blurred and he vanished from the room.

"I… he… you…" Zhou Zui's eyes widened, his hands flailed unnaturally, and he stammered, unable to say anything. Yet, he noticed that the others in the room had no reaction to what Zhou Tian had just said.

"Zhou Tian, he…?" Golden flames ignited in Liu Yan's pupils, spinning like a great sun, as she stared at the spot where Zhou Tian had just disappeared.

Zhang Yi reopened his Celestial Eye on his forehead, which glowed golden. He scanned every inch of space with a frown. "No formation, and it wasn't Butler Zhou's doing…"

Golden dragons coiled in Zhou Xun Chuan's eyes, divine light shooting out three inches. He suddenly recalled the abnormalities in the imperial palace some time ago; that day seemed to be the day Zhou Tian entered the palace! The eyes of the others also glowed golden, all of them using mystical pupil techniques to observe.

Sun Dao picked up a bronze coin covered in rust. He observed the spot through its tiny opening. Traces of time's aura emanated from it. The bronze coin glowed with divine light, reversing time. The scene of Zhou Tian teleporting just now reappeared.

"No magic treasure was used!"

The few people exchanged glances. Zhou Xun Chuan chuckled and said, "It seems our Prince Qin's Heir is hiding a little secret!"

Zhou Zui sighed in relief when he saw that the others weren't bothered by what Zhou Tian had just said, not noticing the faint blush behind Liu Yan's ears… However, he noticed everyone looking at him, because he was the only one who hadn't shown any surprised expression, as if he had expected it. Zhou Zui gave a wry smile, not knowing how to explain…

Zhou Tian was currently in a rather awkward situation. The VIP seats were high up, quite far from the arena. Although after three deaths, his teleportation range had reached about three hundred meters, this distance was still insufficient. So, he could only teleport three hundred meters at a time, slowly moving towards the arena. But to enhance his imposing aura, he slightly adjusted his posture.

This resulted in the audience, who were already surprised by someone interfering with the match, suddenly seeing a person appear in mid-air, with a cold gaze, his figure flashing through the void intermittently, treading on air with every stride, looking every bit like a master.
