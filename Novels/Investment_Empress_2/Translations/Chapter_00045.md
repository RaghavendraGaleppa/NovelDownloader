# Chapter 45: Elder Han He’s Piercing Screech

Li Mo was giving it his all.

The good news was that he had indeed managed to move the Panjie Meteor Hammer.

The bad news was that he could only move it by a sliver.

This was only possible because the divine weapon had ‘condescended’ to cooperate with him to the utmost extent.

That tiny movement was probably just the weapon borrowing his strength to move on its own.

“This hammer isn’t that big, but its weight is terrifying.”

“I can easily lift the Thornback Turtle now, and my strength is probably over ten thousand pounds.”

Li Mo let go and sighed with emotion.

Fortunately, he never planned to lift this thing by himself.

If he could actually lift it, this divine weapon wouldn’t be sitting at the bottom of the Divine Blade Cave, unseen by the sun for years.

No problem.

He still had his cheat.

“World Seed.”

“I can now use it to apply a portion of its power to my body.”

“The duration is very short, I have to be quick...”

Li Mo didn’t come alone.

Behind him was an entire world.

Although this world had just been born and was still fragile and chaotic.

But.

It was still a world.

*Crackle—*

The moment the World Seed’s power was applied.

The bones throughout his body let out a sound like frying beans. The vital energy and blood within him roared like a flood, and his thirteen main meridians were like furious dragons soaring through the sky.

A boundless, surging, immense power flowed through him.

Li Mo even had the delusion that if there were a handle on this Divine Weapon Mountain, he could lift the entire mountain.

“Rise!”

*Boom—*

A hammer’s roar, a hundred times louder than before, exploded.

The Panjie Meteor Hammer.

After countless years, was once again held in a palm.

For only an instant.

Li Mo quickly stored it into his small world.

Then, he collapsed to the ground as if all his strength had left him. He didn’t even want to move a finger, letting sweat pour out and pool on the ground.

“Luckily... fortunately, the divine weapon isn't technically a living thing.”

“Otherwise, I really wouldn't have been able to put it away with my small world.”

“I actually held a divine weapon just now!”

Little Li’s chest was heaving like a pair of bellows, and stars were dancing before his eyes.

All sorts of chaotic thoughts couldn’t help but surface.

Using power that didn’t belong to him came with a huge backlash. If it had lasted one more breath, his physical body would have started to crumble.

But, he had succeeded in the end...

Li Mo’s consciousness was fading. Right now, he just felt waves of drowsiness washing over him.

Just as he was about to fall asleep.

He heard a piercing, elderly screech.

It sounded a bit familiar...

Was that Elder Han He?

...

Night had fallen.

Divine Weapon Peak, the Elder’s Residence.

All around, one could see various metal materials and half-finished weapons. It looked less like an elder’s residence and more like an armory.

“The hammer?”

“Where is my Divine Weapon Peak’s ancestral artifact?!”

Looking at the little Li Mo lying there unconscious and snoring.

Elder Han He paced back and forth, doubting his entire life.

Usually steady and composed, he was now completely at a loss.

“Stop muttering to yourself.”

“You’re so annoying it’s killing me.”

Shang Wu sat with her legs crossed, a glimpse of her thigh visible through her palace gown. She propped her chin up with one hand and said:

*Tsk*, “My rotten disciple, sleeping so soundly. He promised to make roast lamb today...”

“It’s an emergency, and you’re still thinking about eating?!”

Elder Han He was so furious his three souls and seven spirits were in turmoil, shaking with rage:

“That’s a divine weapon! The very reason my Divine Weapon Peak is named as such! If it’s gone, even if I die, I won’t have the face to see the ancestors!”

If Shang Wu weren’t here, he wouldn’t have been able to resist shaking Li Mo awake.

“It’s not like anyone can use it anyway, it was just gathering dust there.”

Shang Wu squinted her eyes, displeased.

“And also, if you’re going to speak, do it properly. Why are you shouting so loud? Do you think this old lady is deaf?”

Han He: “...”

What did I do in my past life to deserve meeting this master and disciple pair?

“Hmm... Huh?”

Just then, the young master Li, who had been sleeping for half a day, let out a yawn and seemed to be waking up.

He opened his eyes groggily.

---

And saw a huge, wrinkled face right in front of him, its eyes filled with bloodshot veins.

Little Li was so startled he almost threw a punch.

“Elder Han He, why are you so close? You nearly scared me to death.”

“*I* scared *you*? My soul almost flew out of my body because of you!”

Elder Han He was so angry he laughed, urgently asking:

“Quick, tell me, where’s the hammer? Where is the ancestral master’s hammer?!”

“Ahem!”

Shang Wu clenched her pink fist and deliberately coughed.

It meant, ‘Watch your volume when speaking to the person I’m protecting.’

Elder Han He wanted to curse.

What the hell, my Divine Weapon Peak’s lifeline is gone, and I’m supposed to smile while serving you?

But he knew that getting more anxious wouldn’t help.

Han He could only try to ask in a gentler tone:

“Li Chuanzhen, when you went to the bottom of the Divine Blade Cave, did you see a hammer?”

As he spoke, the old man gestured with his hands: “About this big...”

“I did.”

Li Mo cooperatively nodded.

“Where’s the hammer? Where did it go?!”

Elder Han He’s speech quickened.

“It’s gone.”

Little Li spread his hands.

“Gone?!”

Elder Han He’s vision went black.

Li Mo nodded and continued:

“I did go down to the bottom of the Divine Blade Cave, and I did see the hammer you spoke of, Elder.”

“Out of curiosity, I went up and touched it, and then it was gone.”

“It seemed... that I put it into my Sumeru Object.”

Li Mo left out some parts of the process.

And changed ‘small world’ to ‘Sumeru Object’.

That’s right, this world has things like storage bags, collectively known as Sumeru Objects.

For example, the beautiful master’s gourd is one type.

Of course, this item isn’t as common as it is in some novels, where they’re everywhere.

It involves the most mysterious Dao of Space.

Only top-tier experts who are masters of this Dao can open up a space from rare materials.

Thus, Sumeru Objects are extremely rare in quantity.

Besides Shang Wu, not even the other peak elders have such high-end goods. The Qingyuan Sect only has one in the Sect Leader’s possession.

“Disciple, the inheritance you got is pretty good.”

Shang Wu’s almond eyes lit up.

“Sumeru Object?”

Elder Han He was stunned.

His confusion didn’t decrease; it only increased.

For instance, how did Li Mo get close to the Panjie Meteor Hammer?

And how did he take it away?

Even the most powerful Sumeru Object couldn’t take something that its owner couldn’t lift.

“Isn’t it obvious now?”

Shang Wu rubbed her chin, reasoning logically:

“It must be that the hammer recognized a master.”

“Divine weapons, after all, might be weightless to their master but weigh a ton to everyone else, right?”

Li Mo: “???”

It sounded reasonable.

But the Panjie Meteor Hammer didn’t seem to have that characteristic.

Suddenly, Little Li noticed his beautiful master winking at him.

Li Mo caught on immediately:

“Yeah, I didn’t feel how heavy it was at the time.”

“Can you take it out now?”

“You saw it yourself.”

Li Mo shook his head with a bitter smile: “When I put it away, I felt a violent shock to my mind, and I almost lost consciousness. I’m afraid I don’t have the ability to take it out again for a short time.”

Shang Wu said with a smile: “So, you have to let my disciple rest well. If his spirit is injured, hmmph, you might never be able to take it out again.”

This master and disciple were playing off each other perfectly.

“Recognized a master...”

Elder Han He’s vague speculation was confirmed, but his Dao Heart still felt a bit shattered.

Our Divine Weapon Peak’s ancestral artifact, which no one has been able to move since the ancestral master, has been taken away by someone from another peak.

And he’s still only at the Qi and Blood Realm!

His feelings were a complex mix of emotions, and he was also extremely helpless.

The ancestral master truly didn’t leave any related records. What Shang Wu said did seem quite possible.

The hammer was indeed no longer at the bottom of the cave.

This explanation was barely acceptable.

It might be reasonable, but who knows if it’s the real situation? It’s all up to her to say!

After thinking for a moment, Elder Han He spoke:

“In that case, before he can take out the divine weapon, he should stay here at Divine Weapon Peak.”
