# Chapter 442: The Theory of Cause and Effect

Nine azure dragons weaved through the clouds, each scale flashing with blue lightning.

The central dragon suddenly thrust its head out from the thunderclouds, its claws sparking with blinding lightning.

Before Xu Yunfan could react, the dragon dove down with overwhelming force.

In an instant, a bucket-thick azure lightning bolt tore through the clouds and struck him head-on with a deafening roar!

Xu Yunfan instinctively tried to dodge, only to find his meridians suppressed as if by a thousand-ton mountain, unable to even twitch a finger.

The moment the azure lightning pierced through the top of his head, the bones throughout his body cracked like popping beans, and fine beads of blood sprayed from his seven orifices.

An intense pain swept through his limbs like a tidal wave, yet a strange numbing sensation surged from within the agony.

The power of the lightning was scouring his spiritual sense with unstoppable force. With every flash of lightning, a bit more clarity appeared in his Sea of Consciousness.

This repeated nine times. When the last bolt of lightning dissipated, Xu Yunfan found his spiritual sense had returned to his body.

The Thunder Pearl in his hand had shrunk by a circle, but the shadow of the dragon within it had become more solid. It was now swimming along his meridians into his Dantian.

Xu Yunfan suddenly opened his eyes, a feeling that was both painful and comfortable rising from his heart.

There was a Thunder Pool inside this Profound Heaven Thunder Pearl that True Lord Qingyuan had captured and refined. When one's mind entered it, they would naturally be subjected to the torment of ten thousand thunders. However, using the means of a True Lord, he had forcibly transformed the Thunder Pool into a Thunder Dragon to temper the spiritual sense.

No wonder even Hundred Peaks True Lord, a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator, couldn't hide his envy upon seeing it.

For the next seven days, Xu Yunfan entered a marvelous state.

Whenever his spirit was full, his mind would sink into the Profound Heaven Thunder Pearl. Each time his mind was washed by the lightning, he could feel his spiritual sense growing stronger. The spiritual sense that could originally cover a radius of ten li had doubled in just seven days.

After each tempering, the shadow of the azure dragon within the Profound Heaven Thunder Pearl would be brought into his body by his spiritual sense, where it would coil in his Dantian, constantly spewing lightning to aid in the cultivation of the Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppression Fortune Method. The excess energy could also temper that wisp of his lifebound sword qi.

[Your Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppression Fortune Method has reached the Initial Stage.]

Xu Yunfan stared at the notification that appeared on his attribute panel, and the tense lines of his shoulders and neck finally relaxed.

After all, the feeling of being watched by a True Lord was quite uncomfortable.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but curse inwardly. He had no idea how the Golden Core True Lord known as the 'Nine Abyss Mysterious Evil Illuminating True Lord' had set his sights on him. He hadn't even met the man before suffering this unprovoked disaster, which was truly infuriating.

He slowly exhaled a breath of turbid qi, which actually condensed in the meditation room into a wisp of green smoke entwined with fine lightning.

The marvel of the *Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppression Fortune Method* far exceeded his expectations.

This technique uses lightning as the needle and dragon's breath as the thread to reweave one's own causal threads.

Whenever the Thunder Dragon phantom moves within his Dantian, he can clearly sense the causal lines extending outward from him being burned and faded by the lightning.

Cultivators of the Dao often live in seclusion, far from the mundane world, precisely to avoid entanglement in karma.

Foundation Establishment cultivators, because their spiritual sense has developed the ability to reflect things, can vaguely perceive and manipulate the causal threads of others.

However, the Heavenly Dao operates in a cycle, and retribution is never missed.

If one frequently intervenes in the karma and destiny of fellow cultivators of the same level, their own life's path will become as tightly woven as a spider's web.

Every causal line forcibly twisted will eventually rebound upon the practitioner, adding more tribulations to their path of cultivation.

What is truly remarkable is that this technique does not simply sever karma. Instead, through its "Impermanence" characteristic, it places the practitioner's destiny in a chaotic state of "seemingly severed, yet not truly severed."

Just like at this moment, Xu Yunfan could simultaneously sense three completely different causal trends.

One showed that he would eventually die at the hands of the Nine Abyss True Lord. Another foretold that he would counter-kill the True Lord and prove his Dao. And the third was a completely chaotic phase that had broken free from its original life's path.

This was only the Initial Stage. If he were to cultivate it to Great Perfection or even the Pinnacle Realm, natural myriad changes would emerge.

This is the very essence of what the Lock Calamity Suppression Fortune Method calls "practicing the changes of impermanence," making it so that those who divine the heavenly secrets can never capture a definite trajectory.

However...

This method of reaching the Initial Stage seems rather like courting death!

If a True Lord were to divine these three paths of karma for him, they would likely stop at nothing to erase him completely.

A sense of警兆 (warning) suddenly arose in Xu Yunfan's heart, and cold sweat instantly soaked his back.

Although this *Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppression Fortune Method* could confuse the heavenly secrets, the three-fold karma trajectory it displayed at this moment was far too conspicuous. It was like lighting three torches simultaneously in the dark, which only made his location easier to expose, and it was a complete provocation to a True Lord.

If a being like the Nine Abyss True Lord, who is proficient in divination techniques, were to detect it, it would likely lead to an immediate, relentless pursuit.

He immediately formed a hand seal to restrain the lightning, twisting the three causal lines back into a chaotic state. He secretly vowed that unless it was a matter of life and death, he would never easily use this technique again.

He must not use it unless absolutely necessary!

He could only use it after reaching Great Perfection, when he could practice the myriad changes of impermanence. For now, he could only get by using the Tortoise Breath Concealing Spirit Technique from the True Martial Subduing Demon Canon.

He had already cultivated the True Martial Subduing Demon Canon to Great Perfection, so naturally, he could easily use the Tortoise Breath Concealing Spirit Technique to hide his form and spirit. As long as he didn't show himself in front of people and didn't deliberately leave traces while practicing it, there was a high probability he would be overlooked.

Unfortunately, his opponent was a True Lord...

It would be great if he had a heavenly treasure.

Xu Yunfan, still not satisfied, couldn't help but sigh.

Well, people naturally want everything.

Meanwhile, the wisp of pale green sword qi, refined through the cultivation of the Myriad Calamities Transformation Sword Art within his Dantian, was gradually transforming under the tempering of the lightning. Fine lightning patterns began to appear on the sword's body, like ancient runes carved by heavenly thunder.

As the Profound Heaven Thunder Pearl continuously released dragon's breath and lightning, the sword qi finally condensed into a three-inch azure lightning small sword. The spine of the sword was coiled with a lifelike azure dragon pattern.

Whenever lightning flowed past, the dragon pattern would move as if it were a living creature, and occasionally, blinding electric light would flash from its eyes.

At the same time, the cultivation of the True Martial Subduing Demon Canon also reached a turning point.

The lightning power had pierced through the final three acupoints, and the true energy within his body had completely transformed into a mercury-like state.

Xu Yunfan's bones cracked throughout his body, and his physique was further strengthened and enhanced. Now, he could truly be said to possess jade-like skin and a celestial bone structure!

On the morning of the tenth day, a clear and melodious sword chant suddenly rang out from within the cave dwelling.

The moment Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, a bolt of lightning flashed through each of them.

He opened his mouth and spat out a streak of green light. That lifebound lightning sword traced a marvelous trajectory through the air, leaving fine electric sparks in its wake.

"It's done!"

Xu Yunfan couldn't hide his joy.

The *Myriad Calamities Transformation Sword Art* had been successfully cultivated, and the lifebound lightning sword had taken its initial form.

The *Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppression Fortune Method* had also completed the first step of "Thunder Pearl Entering the Body." The Profound Heaven Thunder Pearl had been completely refined by him and incorporated into his essence, energy, and spirit.

Even the proficiency of the long-stagnant True Martial Subduing Demon Canon had seen a significant improvement.

He finally had a sliver of a sense of security.

Xu Yunfan came back to his senses. One seclusion for cultivation had actually taken nearly half a year.

He felt a sense of emotion.
