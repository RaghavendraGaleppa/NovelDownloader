# Chapter 674: All Thanks to the Predecessor

At the summit of the Divine Firmament Mountain, purple-gold lightning cascaded like a waterfall, ceaseless day and night.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged in the center of the flattened peak, upon a natural formation of thunder talisman patterns. The entire mountain resembled a massive thunder furnace, with its vast, pure primordial thunder force—far exceeding that of the old Divine Firmament Peak by thousands of times—frenziedly pouring into his body.

The nascent Heaven's Blueprint evolving within his Golden Core, nourished by this overwhelming primordial force, saw its spatial barriers solidify at a visible rate. The thunder generated within began to carry a denser rhythm of destruction and creation.

"Refining the Core to transform the Heaven; True Lord Dongming's words were not false."

Xu Yunfan immersed his mind in the process. Combining the insights on Core refinement from True Lord Dongming's jade slip with the precise proficiency feedback from his Attribute Panel, his understanding of the early Golden Core stage deepened rapidly.

Perhaps everything True Lord Dongming provided was true, but Xu Yunfan was certain the man had omitted crucial details at key junctures. A slight error at the start would lead to a thousand-mile deviation, allowing Xu Yunfan to waste his time in vain.

However, the other party never expected Xu Yunfan to possess an Attribute Panel that allowed for constant trial and error. Every time he contemplated a path of cultivation, the interface would constantly prompt him on whether it was useful. As a result, Xu Yunfan's progress was swift.

"Damn it, this bitch actually left out a section here."

Having just tested a wrong path, Xu Yunfan looked at a message popping up on his vision. His eye twitched slightly, but he wasn't particularly angry.

The Golden Core is like a fertilized egg, the beginning of all gestation. However, how to nurture it and in what direction to proceed are matters of great detail and regulation. Once done recklessly, it implies a malformed development and an improper position. Naturally, it would lead to a dead end.

Women truly have venomous hearts!

Good thing I left some traps of my own.

Xu Yunfan found some comfort in that.

Right now, on the Attribute Panel, the status for *Divine Firmament Nine Chasms Mystic穹 Indestructible Scripture* showed "Perfected," but a new line of information had appeared below it.

**[Divine Firmament Golden Core (Early Stage): Stability 87% → 92% → 96%...]**

Every wash of the accumulated laws of Divine Firmament Thunder from the mountain, and every comprehension of Dongming's insights, caused this number to jump steadily and rapidly. A realm that would typically take a Golden Core True Lord decades or even a century to stabilize was being completed here at an astonishing speed, thanks to the mountain's primordial force and the Attribute Panel.

In his heart, Xu Yunfan sincerely thanked the accumulation辛苦 of the previous Divine Firmament True Lord; now, it had all benefited him.

Now that his Golden Core was completely stable and his Dao Fruit was firm and unshakable, he could truly say that the Divine Firmament Dao Fruit belonged to him, Xu Yunfan.

He attempted to draw upon the deeper power of the Divine Firmament Dao Fruit. With a slight movement of his mind, a wisp of purple-gold lightning flickered at his fingertips. It was no longer a simple thunder strike but transformed into a fine net of lightning. Between the meshes of the net, space twisted slightly, actually pulling in and annihilating wisps of chaotic qi.

This was a more exquisite display of thunder control, touching the edge of the Divine Firmament Dao laws.

Simultaneously, he sank his consciousness into the nascent Heaven's Blueprint within his dantian. That chaotic little world composed of thunder, nourished by the power of the Golden Core and supplemented by fragments of the Divine Firmament Mountain's primordial laws, saw its boundaries gradually becoming clear.

These were the legacies accumulated by the previous Divine Firmament True Lord over the ages. After True Lord Pure Yang cut him down, they had now conveniently fallen to Xu Yunfan.

He tried guiding a wisp of his spiritual sense to make the internal thunder operate along specific trajectories, attempting to evolve more fundamental laws of birth and destruction. Although it was merely a prototype of a prototype, and every attempt consumed a great deal of energy with slow progress—messages on the interface would only pop up after a long while—this was the beginning of "transforming the Heaven."

Using the Golden Core as the pivot and the nascent Heaven as the furnace to evolve his own Great Dao laws.

In the days that followed, Xu Yunfan was exceptionally busy. The Divine Firmament Dao Fruit needed to be deeply excavated, and the various wonders derived from his self-condensed Golden Core required time to comprehend.

While stabilizing his realm, Xu Yunfan did not forget the defenses of the Divine Firmament Mountain. He communicated with the entire immortal mountain with his mind, his spiritual sense sweeping through the natural thunder nodes and earth vein hubs within the mountain.

"The Zhoutian Starry Array, heed my command!"

He let out a low shout, waving his sleeve. Three hundred and sixty-five miniature Star Spirit Banners' shadows分化出 a wisp of aura from the main body, turning into streams of light that precisely pierced into key nodes throughout the Divine Firmament Mountain. The main banner was deeply imprinted into the core depths of the mountain, connecting it to the primordial force of the Divine Firmament Mountain.

*Hum!*

The entire Divine Firmament Mountain trembled slightly. Within the violent thunder clouds at the peak, specks of starlight suddenly lit up. These were not real stars but projections of void stellar power drawn by the activation of the core nodes of the Zhoutian Starry Array. They echoed with the thunder talismans inside the mountain, forming an invisible giant net covering the entire immortal mountain.

Purple-gold thunder and silver-white starlight intertwined and flowed, a vast, majestic aura—combining destruction and protection—permeated the air, enveloping the Divine Firmament Mountain.

Although limited by the number of banner spirits, it was far from the complete Zhoutian Starry Array and could not trap or kill a True Lord, its defensive power far exceeded that of a typical sect-protecting array. Moreover, with three Golden Core banner spirits residing within, Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't use them as static points; that would be a true waste. Even the other banner spirits only分化出 a wisp of aura, infused into the array flags he had refined.

Combined with the Divine Firmament Mountain's own solid spatial barriers and thunder primordial force, it was enough to withstand the full-force attack of an early-stage Golden Core True Lord and provide Xu Yunfan with a home-field advantage. It was even possible that, relying on the Star Spirit Banners and the meticulously arranged array, he might be able to endure a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator.

After finishing all this, Xu Yunfan finally turned his gaze to the outer area of the Primordial Origin Sect, the peak that once belonged to him: the Divine Firmament Peak.

His spiritual sense moved slightly, and a purple-gold thunder edict containing his will tore through the void and departed.

Not long after, several streaks of light rose from the direction of the Divine Firmament Peak. Carrying excitement and trepidation, they crossed the vast sea of clouds within the Primordial Origin Sect and finally landed outside the protective array of the Divine Firmament Mountain.

The leader was Bi Yuan, followed by Xuezhen, Qingming, Mud Old Man, Hemp-clothed Old Taoist, and a few core disciples who had performed well during the time at Divine Firmament Peak.

Looking at the magnificent immortal mountain surrounded by thunder with faint starlight appearing, and feeling the suffocating, majestic pressure, they were all shocked in their hearts, so excited they could hardly control themselves.

"Pay respects to the Divine Firmament True Lord!"

Everyone bowed in unison, their voices trembling. They knew Xu Yunfan had achieved the status of True Lord, but only now, standing before his immortal mountain, did they truly feel the might of a Golden Core and the grandeur of an immortal mountain.

Xu Yunfan's figure appeared silently before the mountain gate. Purple-gold lightning was contained within his body, and the robes of the Divine Firmament True Lord fluttered without wind. His aura was as deep as the sea. He swept his gaze over the crowd, nodded slightly to Bi Yuan and the others, and then looked at the disciples.

"Rise. Since you have entered the Divine Firmament Mountain, you are all disciples under my command. The spiritual qi and primordial force here are far superior to the past; you must cultivate diligently and not waste this opportunity."

He raised a finger, and the protective array opened a portal, guiding everyone inside. At the same time, his spiritual sense moved slightly, designating several areas on the periphery of the Divine Firmament Mountain—rich in spiritual qi and relatively peaceful—as their cultivation caves.
