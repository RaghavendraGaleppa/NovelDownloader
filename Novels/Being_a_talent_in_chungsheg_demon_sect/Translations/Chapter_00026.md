# Chapter 26: Worthy of a Sacred Sect

The land was like a painting, the setting sun like blood.

Lu Yang stood above the sea of clouds. It was a while before he realized that no palm strike had descended from the sky to shatter him into dust, and only then did he finally breathe a sigh of relief.

"Was that... a Foundation Establishment True Person just now?"

Lu Yang didn't even dare to speak aloud, only pondering in his mind, his face ashen. The gap between them was simply too vast. His body, even his thoughts, had been frozen. He only reacted after Daoist Hongyun left. That feeling was like a mouse caught in a cat's paw; it was no longer merely a difference in strength, but a distinction in *layers* of existence, instantly crushing all pride in Lu Yang's heart.

"I am still too weak; I lack power."

Previously, after single-handedly defeating Liu Xin and others, Lu Yang had swept away the gloom of his previous life, feeling invigorated. Now, however, he had once again humbled his mindset.

The path of immortality is long; one must strive forward with constant effort.

Lu Yang sighed with emotion, then recalled Xiao Shiye's situation, a renewed dread surfacing in his eyes: "Luck, can it actually be bestowed by others?"

Now, he remembered. Before Xiao Shiye went to the Merit Pool, he had said something: "It just so happens that I've suddenly been quite lucky lately, so I want to take this opportunity to try my luck."

*Recently quite lucky.*

At the time, Lu Yang had only thought it was the humility of a Son of Destiny, but now it seemed that might have been the truth—he genuinely had only recently become lucky.

Because of that Daoist Hongyun!

"The 'colorful fish' in the Merit Pool must be the colorful merit fish, right? Daoist Hongyun wants to use Xiao Shiye to fish it out of the Merit Pool?"

"If that's truly the case, then he succeeded in my previous life. However, thinking back, after Xiao Shiye fished out the colorful merit fish in my previous life, he announced his closed-door cultivation and was never heard from again..." Lu Yang shivered at the thought. Fishing, fishing... once the fish is caught, is the bait naturally useless?

At this thought, Lu Yang suddenly looked up.

Initial Sacred Sect, connecting to the cloud sea.

Perhaps for those mysterious and elusive high-ranking members of the Sacred Sect, these so-called disciples were merely a group of fish kept in a pond?

"Worthy of a Sacred Sect indeed..."

Lu Yang took a deep breath, somewhat understanding why no one had simply killed him. What if a fish, even if it leaped a bit more excitedly, had some unspeakable secrets? Perhaps they even saw him as a talent!

"In any case, at least the secret of the [Book of Hundred Lives] was not exposed." Lu Yang inwardly rejoiced. Not only that, but the karma related to the Book of Hundred Lives also seemed to have been concealed from True Person Hongyun, leading the other party to have no suspicion as to why he possessed the fourth layer of Qi Condensation cultivation even before officially joining the sect.

"No time to lose. I should go back and eat first."

Fortunately, although the *Innate Dao Scripture* was taken by Daoist Hongyun, Lu Yang had already memorized all of its contents before then. This was a good habit Lu Yang had developed because of the [Book of Hundred Lives]. Whenever he encountered a good cultivation art or divine ability, he would immediately memorize it, so he could use it in his next life without having to spend contribution points to exchange for it again.

Moreover, Daoist Hongyun had taken the *Innate Dao Scripture*, but he hadn't taken Immortal Qingchen's *Secret Manual of Array Treasures*.

"Admittedly, the two are incomparable; Immortal Qingchen's item clearly didn't even catch that one's eye. But for me, it's of great use!"

In truth, Lu Yang didn't value the *Innate Dao Scripture* that much, as his goal was already set on Zhao Xuhe's third-grade True Art. The *Innate Dao Scripture* was optional for him. Instead, he was very interested in cultivation arts like the *Secret Manual of Array Treasures*, which involved array formation and artifact refining.

As for the Innate Primordial Qi Myriad Spirit Banner...

"There will always be a chance. Maybe next life."

Returning to his cave mansion, Lu Yang first patiently cultivated, pondering the *Secret Manual of Array Treasures* while slowly repairing the damage his sword pellet had sustained. It wasn't until half a month later that he emerged again.

This time, he sought out Zhao Xuhe.

When he arrived at Zhao Xuhe's cave mansion, he saw Zhao Xuhe attempting to explain something to a stern-faced young man dressed in Enforcement Hall attire.

"Senior Brother, you must believe me! Don't you know Zhao Xuhe's reputation? It's been excellent for over a decade! It's just 1000 contribution points, I'll definitely pay it back... What? Interest!? You... Fine, no problem. Senior Brother, please give me a few more days; I'll definitely pay back both principal and interest..."

After they argued for a moment, the Enforcement Hall disciple scoffed and left.

Zhao Xuhe stood there with a gloomy expression, his aura fluctuating erratically. Seeing that the timing was right, Lu Yang immediately revealed himself and walked over.

"Senior Brother Zhao, long time no see."

Zhao Xuhe looked up at the sound, immediately sensing Lu Yang's undisguised aura. His pupils contracted: "Junior Brother Lu, you've broken through to late-stage Qi Condensation!?"

"Just lucky, just lucky."

Lu Yang smiled faintly: "I'm dull-witted. After cultivating in seclusion for several months and spending quite a few contribution points, I fortunately broke through. You must be laughing at me, Senior Brother."

Zhao Xuhe's expression stiffened even further, even twisting slightly. After all, both of them had been "speculating on stand-in Yin puppets." He had lost everything, even his mistress had run off with someone else, while Lu Yang had profited immensely, even using his earnings to break through to late-stage Qi Condensation.

What was even more infuriating was that he might not even be a match for Lu Yang anymore!

"Although I obtained the opportunity of True Person Panlong, due to insufficient luck and merit, I only got half of that third-grade True Art..."

He had even specifically asked his master about it once. His master had deduced the karma and concluded that it was because he had prematurely exhausted three lifetimes' worth of accumulated merit by speculating on stand-in Yin puppets, which led to his failure at the last moment.

At this thought, Zhao Xuhe nearly ground his teeth to dust. Half of a third-grade True Art, only the Qi Condensation stage's *Nine Transformations Dragon Art*, but missing the Foundation Establishment stage cultivation art—it was completely useless to him!

Not to mention he was currently in debt and didn't even dare to disperse his cultivation and switch to another art, fearing that during the process of switching, debt collectors would come knocking. If they saw him powerless after dispersing his cultivation, they might simply transform into bandits, rob him clean, and then murder him to silence him. That would truly be a suffering he couldn't voice.

"Junior Brother, do you need something from me?"

"It's a long story," Lu Yang sighed. "To tell you the truth, Senior Brother, I came to ask for your guidance. Junior Brother has recently run into some trouble."

"Trouble?" Zhao Xuhe's eyes lit up.

Lu Yang sighed upon hearing this: "I was so focused on cultivating before, and it was only after I broke through to late-stage Qi Condensation that I learned about the issue of True Qi grades. My heart is filled with regret..."

Hearing Lu Yang say this, Zhao Xuhe suddenly felt much better.

"Oh, so it's the grade of True Qi."

Zhao Xuhe offered a few insincere words of comfort: "Most disciples in the Sacred Sect don't actually realize this, so it's normal that Junior Brother didn't know..."

"Alas, who knows what fate holds." Lu Yang shook his head helplessly. "That's why I came to you, Senior Brother, to ask if there's any way to improve the grade of my True Qi. If there's a superior cultivation art, even better. As for the price, Senior Brother, you don't need to worry; I can afford one or two thousand contribution points."

"...Oh?"

Hearing Lu Yang say this, Zhao Xuhe's mind instantly became active. One or two thousand contribution points... he just so happened to be in urgent need of that exact amount of money.

In a flash of lightning, Zhao Xuhe's thoughts raced, then he suddenly said:

"Junior Brother Lu, if you put it that way... I actually do have a cultivation art here that might be suitable for you. If you cultivate it, you can definitely improve the grade of your True Qi."

"Really?" Lu Yang's face immediately showed anticipation. "What cultivation art is it?"

Zhao Xuhe hesitated, feeling a strange sensation for some reason. However, he quickly thought that this cultivation art was only half complete and thus already useless. Rather than keeping it, it would be better to put waste to good use and use it to pay off his debts.

With that thought, Zhao Xuhe gritted his teeth and directly took out the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art* he had obtained from Dragon Coil Island, handing it to Lu Yang.
