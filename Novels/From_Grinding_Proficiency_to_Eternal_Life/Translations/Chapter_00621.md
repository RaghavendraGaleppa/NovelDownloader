# Chapter 621: If Not Now, When?

The Cavern Heaven was damaged.

That single strand of sword intent had pierced a gaping hole through his Cavern Heaven.

Visible cracks spread rapidly across his Dharmic Body.

The Sword of Three without Return had indeed come agonizingly close to shattering the very foundation of his Cavern Heaven with one strike.

Had his reaction not been swift enough, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

Xu Yunfan was faring no better.

Forcibly activating the Sword of Three to counter a Golden Core True Lord's Cavern Heaven backlash had pushed the Star Spirit Banner, which protected him, to its absolute limit. Its mournful cry was on the verge of shattering, and the spiritual light on its surface rapidly dimmed.

He couldn't block it. He simply couldn't.

The mere shockwaves of the Golden Core's Dharmic Power felt like the heavens collapsing upon contact.

The Divine Dawn Power within him was completely depleted, and his Purple Mansion Sea of Consciousness felt as if it were being pricked by countless needles, making it almost impossible to stand.

The three strands of Golden Core sword intent were completely exhausted.

The Star Spirit Banner's power had also greatly diminished due to overuse.

Facing the Qingyuan True Lord, who had just caught his breath—even if the man was grievously wounded and on the verge of falling from his realm—Xu Yunfan, completely drained of power, couldn't even put up the slightest resistance.

The Qingyuan True Lord's eyes burned with the fury and violence of utter destruction. He was about to disregard everything and凝聚 the remaining pure qi of the Immortal Palace to deliver the final, fatal blow to Xu Yunfan.

However, the consecutive barrage of the three swords had finally given Xu Yunfan a moment to breathe.

His opponent had momentarily lost his strength.

But killing a Golden Core True Lord was not something Xu Yunfan was contemplating.

As long as the opponent's Cavern Heaven wasn't breached, his true body could not be killed.

What is a Golden Core? It is the Cavern Heaven integrated into the Dao Fruit, refined into a Golden Core and swallowed into the dantian. It is the true meaning of "My fate is in my hands, not in the heavens."

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, fully understanding that Qingyuan True Lord was truly willing to suffer a great regression in his cultivation just to kill him.

The only thing that could rival, or at least delay and intimidate, the Qingyuan True Lord at this moment was the Dao Fruit within him—the one he had refined into a Taiyin Crystal Orb, the final manifestation of the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit.

By refining this orb, one could temporarily assume the position of a Dao Fruit and borrow a sliver of a true Golden Core True Lord's power.

But activating it required an unimaginable amount of Dharmic Power, and it would immediately expose the aura of the Dao Fruit.

Once used, the pseudo-Golden Core status achieved for a short time could indeed unleash earth-shattering power, but the consequences that followed were unpredictable.

It was not something a Foundation Establishment cultivator like him, who had yet to condense an immortal Golden Core nature, could easily withstand. The backlash could severely damage his Dao Foundation and would completely expose the fact that the Taiyin Dao Fruit was on his person.

Not only would the grievously wounded Qingyuan True Lord go mad, but it would also attract the attention of other True Lords who sensed the fluctuation of Golden Core-level power, especially the Pudu True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect, who had been relentlessly searching for the vanished Taiyin Dao Fruit of the Heavenly Realm.

A clash of Golden Core-level power, no matter how meticulously crafted the karmic concealment art, could not hide its core Dao rhyme.

But if he didn't use it, he would die immediately.

What should he do?

Using it means death; not using it also means death.

Should he truly use the Soul Exchange to directly possess his clone, Han Shi?

Or perhaps temporarily assume the Golden Core position to make the Qingyuan True Lord suffer a self-detonation before using the Soul Exchange?

Just as Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered with conflicting light, hesitating whether to activate this costly trump card immediately, he suddenly caught a glimpse of Ye Xuan, who was immobilized by the Star Spirit Banner's residual waves, her eyes filled with nothing but terror and emptiness.

An idea flashed through his mind like lightning.

The infighting within the Primordial Origin Sect and the way the True Lords sabotaged each other was something he was all too familiar with.

The Pudu True Lord was personally responsible for the事宜 of devouring and destroying the Heavenly Realm.

Now that the Qingyuan True Lord had made a low-profile appearance, he naturally wanted to get there first.

He immediately abandoned the idea of staking everything on activating the orb. His figure flashed, and the Star Spirit Banner's dark light swept out, pulling Ye Xuan into his grasp.

He looked down at Ye Xuan's pale face. Despite his inner urgency, his words remained calm and composed.

"I know you are an important figure from the Ye family of the Wansheng Sword Sect."

"The Qingyuan True Lord is determined to succeed today. This is true for me, but even more so for you. Do you know what will happen if you fall into his hands?"

Xu Yunfan paused, watching the confusion in Ye Xuan's eyes grow even more profound due to her fear. "In his hands, you will have no path to survival. You might not even be able to enter the cycle of reincarnation. Do you want to live?"

Ye Xuan trembled all over.

The terrifying scenes of destruction from moments ago, where a Golden Core True Lord nearly perished, had already shattered her spirit.

Looking at the disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect before her, covered in blood, his Dharmic Power depleted, yet his gaze still as sharp as a blade.

A mere Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivator who had successively gravely wounded a Golden Core True Lord and even nearly destroyed his Cavern Heaven.

It was simply inconceivable.

Falling into his hands was indeed dangerous, but at least, this one seemed to leave room for negotiation.

Whereas the Qingyuan True Lord, a True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect, known as the "Yuan Demon Sect," was publicly acknowledged to stop at nothing to achieve his goals. He would certainly kill her to silence her.

"I want to live! I want to live!"

A powerful will to survive overcame her hesitation. She knew what Xu Yunfan wanted to ask.

Ye Xuan's voice trembled, but her spiritual sense quickly transmitted a specific spatial coordinate.

"Go there! There is a 'Fissure' landmark here! Hurry!"

Hearing the answer, a sharp glint flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes, and he didn't hesitate for a moment.

He had no time to verify the truth of Ye Xuan's words; it was the only straw he could grasp in this desperate situation.

With his other hand, he reached deep into the tattered sleeve of his Universe Pouch and pulled out an object.

It looked like a small, flat boat.

This vessel was neither gold nor wood, shaped like a willow leaf, its surface inscribed with dense, complex, and profound spatial teleportation formations.

A cunning rabbit has three burrows. As a master refiner, he had naturally crafted many escape treasures.

This boat was precisely for应对 the worst-case scenario. It was refined after the Star Spirit Banner had抽取 the essence of the Heavenly Realm, using countless rare materials combined with his own insights into spatial formations.

A top-grade magic treasure capable of crossing界天 (Realm Skies).

It could carry him across the barriers of the Realm Skies.

Although his Dharmic Power was almost completely exhausted,

Xu Yunfan's last wisp of mental power activated it. The willow-leaf boat instantly burst forth with a silver-green light of spatial Dao rhyme, tightly enveloping Xu Yunfan and the Ye Xuan he was holding.

"Qingyuan!"

Xu Yunfan shouted fiercely, preparing to leave a few harsh words.

"The gift you have given me today, I, Xu, will remember! I will personally return it to you one day!"

Before his words had finished, the spatial light twisted violently, producing a crisp "pop."

The next moment, the silver-green light, along with Xu Yunfan and Ye Xuan's forms, vanished from the spot like a bubble, as if they had never been there at all. Only the even more chaotic and shattered void of the East Sea remained, along with the thick, lingering aura of a Golden Core and the chilling fragments of Dao rhyme from the shattered pure qi of the Immortal Palace.

The Qingyuan True Lord watched, eyes wide, as Xu Yunfan abducted Ye Xuan and vanished right from under his nose. Although the Dao rhyme of that spatial teleportation was exquisite, it could not escape the spiritual sense of a Golden Core True Lord.

"Beyond the Realm Skies, what audacity!!"

The Qingyuan True Lord laughed in his fury, his gloomy expression seeming as if it could drip water.

Beyond the Realm Skies was not infinite void, but the even more terrifying界海 (Realm Sea).

It contained endless chaotic light of creation and destruction, one of the most dangerous substances in the heavens and earth, capable of eroding and dissolving even space itself.

A typical Foundation Establishment cultivator, even one at the peak of Foundation Establishment, would be seeking death by entering it without a special protective treasure or guidance from a True Lord.

The protection of that minor spatial formation wanting to hide its trail was a cosmic joke.

He only needed to follow the faint teleportation trail and the aura emitted by that broken boat to lock onto its position at the edge of the Realm Sea.
