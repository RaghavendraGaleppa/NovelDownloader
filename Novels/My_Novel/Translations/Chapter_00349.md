Chapter 349: Always Like This, Body Close, Heart Close. Flower Cage Li Xian, First in Ancient and Modern Times.

The Star Cloud Palace had seen many changes since its founding during the Great Yu Dynasty, maintaining a distant relationship with the imperial court. During the mid-period, it submitted to the court but only obeyed orders without accepting edicts. This continued into the Great Wu Dynasty, where it was renamed the Star Plucking Division, yet it still only obeyed orders without accepting edicts. As dynasties changed and the political situation shifted, the Star Plucking Division remained.

Wen Caishang was very familiar with the Star Cloud Palace; her identity, background, and ancestral connections were deeply tied to the Great Yu Dynasty. However, the past was past, and she rarely spoke of it. When talking about the "Grand Emperor Wu" of the Great Wu Dynasty, she was even more generous with praise.

The two spoke beneath the covers, their breaths mingling with every word. Every movement they made felt like a cat scratching at the heart, indescribably romantic. Bodies were close, hearts were near. Li Xian called himself "honest," but he was actually the least honest of all. Wen Caishang was too shy to scold him, and due to their intimacy, she let him have his way.

The carriage walls were open, revealing a sky full of bright moon and countless stars. A gentle breeze brushed the willows, and light snow drifted down. The beautiful scenery of this fine moment was reflected in their eyes.

Li Xian sighed, "Madam, I really wish it could be like this forever." Wen Caishang rested her head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat, enjoying the closeness of their skin. Her heart was filled with endless emotion. At first, it might have been driven by interest or various calculations, but ultimately, it was she who had picked Li Xian out from the mud. At that time, he was young and inexperienced; now, he has shed some of that youthfulness but remains handsome and carefree. She had trained him in martial arts, taught him various ways and aristocratic etiquette. At the time, she had no ulterior motives, only feeling that her heart was lonely, and having a young man to relieve boredom was nice. Occasionally, when the mood struck, she would刁难 (tease) him, punish him, or threaten him... watching his reactions and listening to him try every means to please and fawn. Looking back now, the seeds of love had already been planted back then, they just hadn't sprouted or grown yet. This relationship, one could say, was a series of coincidences, truly hard to anticipate. Recalling that time, it had a unique flavor, a relaxed joy that others could not comprehend. She never imagined that in the blink of an eye, Li Xian had already achieved some success. Although he used insidious means to subdue her, it was a rebellious act that always left her angry and indignant. Yet, upon careful reflection, it held a unique romantic charm, and she found herself enjoying it secretly.

During a casual chat at night, Wen Caishang suddenly felt curious and asked, "Li Lang, what did you feel when you first saw me?" Li Xian was stunned. Recalling the events in the manor, he was trapped in a cage then, desperate to break free and soar to the sky. But now, tasting the memory again, the flavor was different. He said, "The first time I saw you, Madam, you probably didn't notice me. That day you returned to the manor in a palanquin, I was among the servants. I cautiously looked up for a peek."

As he spoke, he immediately avenged his former trembling caution. Wen Caishang glared at him, feeling utterly helpless, having no choice but to let him be. Li Xian continued, "I didn't dare look at your face then, only caught a glimpse of your boots. I still remember the patterns, but it seems I haven't seen you wear them since. I thought then that this Madam must be a beauty that could sink fish and fall geese, or shame the moon and hide flowers." Wen Caishang frowned slightly. Hearing the praise, her heart was greatly pleased, followed by a shy glare. She thought, "You only dared to peek from afar back then, but now... you're scratching and grabbing. This little rascal, using all his bad tricks on me." But she felt the sole of her foot warm as it was held in his hand. Occasionally, a tickle made her shiver.

She asked softly again, "But later, when you got a proper look, you must have been disappointed. You must have thought, 'What kind of Madam, just ordinary.' How could that be considered sinking fish and falling geese, or shaming the moon and hiding flowers?" Li Xian said, "On the contrary, sinking fish and falling geese, shaming the moon and hiding flowers, in my eyes, are far from enough." Wen Caishang smiled charmingly and asked, "Then tell me, what would be enough?"

Li Xian said, "I admit my knowledge is insufficient to describe it. Later, I read through many miscellaneous books. I tried to find a word or a phrase in ancient texts to describe your beauty. I searched for a whole night! Madam, guess what happened later."

Wen Caishang saw Li Xian's animated expression. She knew his nature well; he was trying to be clever again. But she always fell for it, always fell for it. Every time at this moment, her heart was happy and expectant. She laughed, "I'm not guessing. You're just saying sweet words, how can I possibly believe you?"

After a while, seeing that Li Xian really wasn't going to say, her curiosity got the better of her, and she asked, "And then?"

Li Xian sighed, "Then dawn broke." Wen Caishang was stunned, then burst out laughing. She scolded, "You... I really don't know what to do with you. No one speaks sweet words as smoothly as you do." Li Xian said, "This matter is actually your fault. If your looks were just a little worse, then phrases like sinking fish and falling geese would be perfectly suitable. Why did I have to flip through books all night, leaving my shoulders sore?"

Hearing Li Xian's constant flow of praise, Wen Caishang was in an excellent mood, feeling her heart melt within it.

Li Xian asked curiously, "Madam... what do you think of me?" Wen Caishang struggled for a moment, her beautiful eyes filled with complaint as she said, "Is there even a need to say it? You, this wicked servant who bullies his master, you bad boy. You should have some self-awareness; I wish I could beat you right now. Ah... you thief hand, I really need to cut it off."

Li Xian laughed, "Since Madam sees me that way, I won't pretend anymore." He sniffed her hair, put his arm around her waist, touched her shoulder... his actions intimate and close. Wen Caishang couldn't help but feel shy, yet she was extremely happy. Her figure and looks were like a treasure; if no one were to excavate them, it would be a pity for them to be admired alone.

The long night passed slowly.

The two played for a while, sometimes confessing sweet words, sometimes talking about the various aspects of the martial world, sharing what they had seen and heard. Outside, warm charcoal burned slowly; inside, there were silk quilts. Gauze curtains hung from the carriage roof, and the walls were open.

A gentle breeze lifted the gauze curtains. The bed was actually not large; lying together was quite cramped. The quilt was made of silk, retaining heat very well, and was extremely comfortable. Seeing the bright moon in the sky, Li Xian said softly, "Madam, let's sleep. It's getting late." With that, he closed his eyes.

Wen Caishang nodded gently, her thoughts drifting, sleepiness accumulating, her eyelids growing heavy as she was about to close her eyes and sleep. Suddenly, her eyes snapped open, her sleepiness completely gone, and she glared fiercely at Li Xian. Seeing Li Xian's peaceful sleeping face, completely unconcerned with the outside world, as if he were already in a dream, she gritted her teeth, knowing this thief was pretending to be serious and definitely hadn't fallen asleep, because she was currently suffering from his actions.

Hearing a few more light snores, she saw that Li Xian was already pretending to sleep, and anger surged within her. Unwilling to show weakness, she closed her eyes and pretended to sleep as well. Only, from time to time, her delicate brows would furrow slightly, and she would lightly bite her red lips, cursing in her heart: "This小子 (little brat) is determined not to let me sleep well. This bad小子... where did he learn such behavior? It's all suffering for me. If he becomes more capable than me in the future, I... I will inevitably be bullied by him."

Her mind was restless, but she could do nothing about Li Xian.

The next day. The grandeur of Feilong City remained the same. Qu Baitong, impersonating He Wentian, had pulled off the deception without any mistakes. The order in the city was well-maintained, and there was a dense flow of guests. Wen Caishang had just fallen asleep as dawn was breaking. There was a new quilt in the bottom cabinet of the carriage. Li Xian helped change it, took the old one to wash, and hung it on a tree branch to dry. Li Xian found a place to practice martial arts, tempering the techniques of the Specter Spear.

[Specter Spear]
[Proficiency: 8012/35000 Perfection]
[Proficiency +1]

Li Xian practiced until his Qi lake rippled. His internal Qi had accumulated to "one hundred and seven zhang." It was surging and powerful; his moves were well-controlled, sharp and precise. His spear technique had deeply reached perfection, not deviating in the slightest.

Feilong City was bustling with excitement, but Li Xian had no more attachment to it. Today, he decided to stay with his Madam for a long time and enjoy another fine moment of spring night. He wielded his spear to his heart's content. Seeing the ice and snow on Snow Lake melting, the lake water a deep, dark green, exuding a sense of spring warmth.

His intention arose with his mind, and his spear followed his heart. The Ghost Python Spear plunged into the lake, stirring and playing. He executed the move "Specter Playing with Water," and the lake water obeyed his manipulation. The Ghost Python Spear was as soft as a long whip; the spear tip swayed in the water, stirring up waves.

Suddenly, three sounds of "bang, bang, bang" were heard. Three water columns exploded from the lake surface, with great power and momentum, waking Wen Caishang. Although she was restrained and trapped, her body, cultivated by health-preserving techniques, perfect physique, countless precious medicinal baths, and unique secret methods... her strength, endurance, and energy were far superior to others. Although she couldn't sleep well last night, she didn't feel tired. She straightened her waist and observed the mysteries of the Specter Spear.

The splashes of water fell with a哗啦啦 (huā lā lā) sound. The slanting sunlight refracted a colorful halo. Wen Caishang saw Li Xian's spear technique was sharp and his appearance handsome. Surrounded by the scenery, he looked even more extraordinary. She thought: "Good boy... he's really getting more and more powerful. From my observation, this spear technique might have some connection to the Specter and Demon Spear. And he has also reached perfection, his spear technique is seamless and natural. He not only possesses various unique qualities, but just in terms of martial arts talent, his progress is also quite good."

This day, Li Xian stayed by Snow Lake, playing and practicing martial arts, keeping his Madam company. The fish and beasts in the lake had tender, sweet flesh without any fishy smell. Li Xian caught fish and cooked them, eating grilled fish and drinking fish soup... it was delicious.

Li Xian still had "Flicking Finger Golden Light" and "Only My Heart Skill" that he hadn't deeply researched. Seeing that Wen Caishang was unusually compliant, he accompanied her whenever he had free time. His martial path did slacken slightly, but the Specter Spear made tremendous progress, digesting his gains and absorbing lessons learned, accumulating 400 proficiency points daily.

In this way, three days passed in a flash. Li Xian had enjoyed himself for three days, relaxed and carefree, venting his pent-up anger to the fullest. The "Green Fragrance Pavilion" of the past, and the "Heart-wrenching Sword" that Wen Caishang had given him, had all been repaid. He secretly calculated that the time to leave was near. This day, while practicing his spear by the lake, he saw a layer of frost on the surface of Snow Lake. Li Xian thought to himself: "It seems the sword intent of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword is gradually dissipating. The spring scene of Snow Lake is actually the result of the convergence of Yin and Yang, the alternation of cold and heat. Now it is mid-February, still winter. Once the sword technique's evolution ends, it will naturally go from spring to winter, and the lake surface will freeze again. In that case, I should escape now. If I linger on this beauty any longer, the consequences will be dire."

Li Xian, without changing his expression, returned to the carriage and embraced Wen Caishang. She smiled softly and charmingly, but confidence was gradually gathering in the depths of her eyes. She pleaded, "Li Lang, I've been very happy lately. Can you stay with me a few more days?"

Li Xian thought: "If I stay a few more days, the Yin-Yang sword intent will dissipate. You are still bound by various restraining techniques, and although it's still difficult to break free, your methods and capabilities will inevitably increase. Who knows what手段 (methods) you might use to subdue me无形间 (unconsciously)? Back when I helped you put on the silkworm clothes, you couldn't move either. But you were still unfathomable; you could take my life without moving a finger. To be safe, I need to leave first." He said, "Good, I would be delighted. Madam, let's live here long-term and never part."

Wen Caishang said, "That would be best. I was caught by you, this little混蛋 (bastard), I was truly too careless. I can't move now, and these past few days I've suffered quite a bit at your hands." In her heart, she thought: "Once the sword intent dissipates, the Yin and Yang energies won't disturb the evolution of my martial arts. I'll first use 'Enchanting Eyes' to confuse his mind. This小子 is too cautious. If only my fingers were free, I just need to find an opportunity to lightly tap his pressure point. Even if my whole body is still immobilized, I could easily subdue him. But he... he even restrained my fingers. Now, only 'Enchanting Eyes' can be used. I'll have to take it step by step and seek other opportunities."

Wen Caishang thought: "This time I'll catch you. These days of humiliation must be repaid." A chill rose in her heart. But then, it kept rippling, and she asked herself: "I, Wen Caishang, being captured is truly a first in my life. It is naturally extremely humiliating. I never expected this狼狈 (wretched) appearance would one day fall upon me. But after several days... it... it gives me an indescribable feeling. This小子 treats me, clearly without any courtesy, but in the end, my anger always vanishes unconsciously, and I just can't bear to punish or scold him. Although I always harden my heart to punish and scold him, my heart also aches in the end. Before this, I had never loved anyone. Uncle Xiang, Qiuyue, Pang Long, and others, even if they died before my eyes, I would feel no ripples in my heart. But this小子 has left me utterly at a loss. Could it be that there really is a hidden retribution in this world?"

Looking at Li Xian, her gaze was as soft as autumn water. That night, the two slept together again. The next day, at noon when the sun was high, Li Xian finally woke up. Even if he was greedy, he had to make a choice. While Wen Caishang was still asleep, he applied several more ropes to her. Then he closed the carriage door, lit the stove, burned warm charcoal, and left a small gap in the window.

He blew out the candle, and finally covered her neatly with the quilt. He replanted a strand of hair in one corner of the carriage, and two more outside the carriage, ensuring his vision was unobstructed and his ears and eyes were clear, so he could see Wen Caishang's condition at any time.

He then put the jade walnut back into Wen Caishang's mouth. With everything ready, he pushed the carriage to a flat spot. After ensuring Wen Caishang's safety, he turned and fled. He ran several miles in a row, but suddenly felt a sense of attachment. He jumped onto a large tree, from which he could vaguely see the carriage.

Li Xian thought: "My strength is still shallow, how dare I talk about lingering in temporary warmth? Li Xian, Li Xian, you must work hard, you must be diligent and tireless. Wait until the day I can subdue the Madam without relying on these crooked ways. Only then can I keep the Madam by my side, whether by capturing or seizing her, I can truly possess her, rather than relying on her, suffering her sword, and being constrained by her. But after this separation, I don't know when I can enjoy the Madam's embrace again."

It was mid-February, deep in winter, the time for parting. Li Xian watched for a while longer, and finally left resolutely. He ran all the way to a nearby path and found the white horse.

The white horse recognized Wen Caishang as its master, but it treated Li Xian very gently. Li Xian stroked the horse's fur and sighed, "I'm leaving today, but I can't take you. Stay here well, someone will come to take you back later."

He channeled two strands of internal Qi into the white horse, fed it dried vegetables, and tied it to a large tree. He turned and left, making several leaps, and had already left Snow Mountain. He ran back along the road to Feilong City.

He went straight to the Green Fragrance Pavilion. Seeing that Xiao Tuan was happily alone, with no shortage of money and a high status, she was actually quite free and at ease now that Wen Caishang was away. Li Xian pondered: "With the Madam in this state, even without the Yin-Yang sword intent, it's probably not easy to break free. When she was betrayed by Qiuyue in the past, she asked me to help her break free. But as soon as I got close, she used strange moves against me. I'll let her stay trapped for three more days, giving me more time."

His senses detected that Wen Caishang had already woken up, shouting and cursing with a muffled voice, her beautiful eyes filled with murderous intent. It was clear she already knew Li Xian had escaped. Li Xian bought some writing tools, hid in an alley, and wrote a letter: "The Madam invites you, bestowing a great opportunity. After three days, follow the map to this location. Arriving a day early, the opportunity will not have arrived; arriving a day late, your life will be in danger. I sincerely hope you will abide by this letter."

The handwriting was bold and vigorous; the beginning, turning, and connecting strokes were all superior to before, and his brushwork had progressed rapidly. Li Xian folded the letter and put it in an envelope. Fearing Xiao Tuan wouldn't believe it, he added a gold hairpin he had taken from Wen Caishang's hair. Finally, he inserted a hand-drawn map.

He then found a high place, strung his bow, and shot an arrow, sending the letter straight into the Green Fragrance Pavilion. Xiao Tuan was in a daze when she suddenly saw an arrow flying towards her. It brushed past her body and nailed into a stone brick. She was so scared her face turned pale, but she didn't dodge or avoid, just hugged her head and crouched on the ground.

She kept muttering: "My little life is gone, my little life is gone. The Madam is so powerful, but I have no martial skills. If a thief强行 (强行) breaks in, I'm afraid it won't end well. This time, my enemies have finally come looking for me." She trembled for half an hour, and seeing that her life was still intact, she boldly looked around.

She saw the arrow was half an inch from her, and there was a letter tied to the arrow tail. She took the letter and read it, unable to help but be suspicious: "The Madam bestows me an opportunity? How strange. If it's true, why didn't the Madam tell me herself, but had to send it by arrow? If it's not true... could it be a little thief trying to lure me out of the Green Fragrance Pavilion to deal with me?"

She smelled the envelope; it indeed had the unique 'Magnolia fragrance' of Wen Caishang. And there was a gold hairpin inside, which the Madam had worn before. Xiao Tuan frowned: "The Madam is so powerful, even the lord of Feilong City is no match for her. Who could possibly deal with her? If she wanted to protect herself, even in the most dangerous situation, she would be fine. She is absolutely safe. Yes, my Madam, what kind of person is she? She dominates the world, snapping her fingers to break a sword. Her beauty is unparalleled. This hairpin must have been given willingly by her."

"I don't understand the inside story, but I just need to do as I'm told. Besides, if they wanted to deal with me, this arrow would have been enough to kill me. Why go to such extra trouble? Or to capture me to threaten the Madam? That's even more nonsensical. The Madam wouldn't even frown. What use is capturing me, Xiao Tuan?"

She hid the envelope and counted on her fingers. Three days, it seemed long but not long, but it would make Wen Caishang wait well.

Li Xian thought darkly: "With the Madam in this state, if Xiao Tuan saw her, wouldn't it be embarrassing? I'm actually looking forward to it. And before I left, I left the Madam a little gift.反正 (Anyway), if I'm caught, the Madam will never let me go. Torture and destruction are inevitable. I might as well offend her deeply."

He had thought it through thoroughly. After ensuring Wen Caishang was arranged perfectly without any mistakes, he prepared to leave. He still had 'seventeen taels' of silver on him. He chose a small eatery on the street, ordered some plain porridge, vegetables, and marinated meat, had a simple meal, ate and drank his fill, prepared some dry rations, and left Feilong City. He walked out of the city gate, looked back at the rows of buildings and the prosperous city, feeling a thousand emotions.

Li Xian traveled southeast, walking for dozens of miles. Along the way, he met all kinds of people: traveling merchants, martial artists, sons of aristocratic families. He hid himself in the vast sea of people, his traces completely vanishing. Towards evening, he found a quiet place and practiced the [Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian].

The martial art manifested its wonder; a five-colored light flowed through his body, showing its divine nature. Li Xian used the wonderful effects of the martial art to calm his body and rest, sensing the condition of his whole body. He discovered there were as many as seventy-four strands of silkworm thread in his hair.

Li Xian secretly felt fear: "If not for the miraculous effect of the Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian, which can enhance perception, I would never have been able to escape the Madam. That Silkworm Clothes Jade Breaking Art is truly powerful and formidable." He removed all the silkworm threads and stored them in the Sky Concealing Box.

He then operated the turbidity of his organs, confirming there were no more omissions. He then continued his journey. The sky was pitch black, and the cold was piercing. Li Xian circulated his Qi through his meridians to resist the cold, but as the cold wind blew, he couldn't help but miss the warmth of his cozy nest. His senses detected that Wen Caishang had now given up struggling and was closing her eyes to practice the Silkworm Clothes Jade Breaking Art internally.

Li Xian mused: "The Flower Cage Sect is not a place for me to stay long-term, but I need to go back to the Water Altar once. Sister Liuli treated me well; I can't just abandon her. Li Xian, Li Xian... sometimes you are too fickle."

Seeing that the wind and snow showed signs of increasing, he didn't rush his journey. He chose a place where the wind and snow were slightly lighter, chopped wood to make a fire, and slept in the snow. He got up early the next morning to continue his journey.

He traveled for half a day more and passed through a village. The road was muddy. Li Xian vaguely heard crying sounds and listened closer. He learned that a family had lost their beloved daughter, a young woman in her prime who had gone missing a few days ago.

Li Xian was surprised: "Could it be the Flower Cage Sect? The Flower Cage Sect doesn't capture poor girls. What's going on?" He listened more carefully. From the fragments of conversation, he learned that their daughter had gone missing two evenings ago on her way to "Red Heart City."

The farmer's family of four lived a frugal life. Losing their daughter was indeed a terrible misfortune. Li Xian secretly mused that if he had the chance, he would lend a hand. He headed in the direction of Red Heart City.

He observed the details along the way. He knew the nature of the Flower Cage Sect well. It was a mixed bag of all sorts of people, fugitives committing crimes, truly causing great harm. Although Li Xian was a member of the sect, he was unwilling to associate with them in their villainy.

He soon found a suspicious character. He lowered his head and tracked him, deliberately making his footsteps heavy. The man sensed he was being followed and immediately fled, using the "Coiled Intestine Step" technique. This made Li Xian even more certain of his identity. With a cold laugh, he quickly followed.

The man fled in a hurry, seeing he couldn't shake Li Xian, and was sweating profusely. He had no choice but to try to lead Li Xian back to their base, hoping to attack him in a group. There was a ruined temple on the outskirts of Red Heart City, abandoned for decades.

About a dozen Flower Cage Sect members had gathered here. They had lit a bonfire and were eating porridge. Inside the ruined temple was a large bronze bell, from which faint cries could be heard. A few sect members, having eaten and drunk their fill, patted their bellies and together lifted the bronze bell.

Inside were three women, all wearing plain cloth clothes, with pretty features but ordinary backgrounds. It turned out... the Flower Cage Sect's rules were loose. After the incident in Feilong City, they had scattered. These few sect members were very lustful. By chance, they had gathered and wanted to capture women to relieve their boredom.

However, they knew their own abilities were shallow. If they followed the sect rules and captured women from famous families, they would inevitably invite disaster and face pursuit. So, after much thought, they decided to pick on the softest targets.

They violated the sect rules and specifically captured ordinary women, bullying ordinary country folk. They were eating when suddenly one man rushed back. He said a仇家 (enemy) was tracking him, and even using the Coiled Intestine Step couldn't shake him off. Hearing the news, everyone was alarmed. Then they all cursed the man, saying he was a villain with bad intentions, always doing things like leading a wolf into the house.

Everyone just thought about saving their own lives and didn't dare to resist at all. But how could Li Xian let them go? He entered the ruined temple and started a flurry of attacks. The disciples had nowhere to run and couldn't fight back. They all fell to the ground, groaning and screaming, seriously injured.

Li Xian untied the ropes of the women and sent them home. The women didn't dare to thank him and just cried and ran away.这时 (At this time), one disciple recognized Li Xian and said, "Ah! Li... Li Elder... you... you've flooded the Dragon King's Temple!"

They all looked up and recognized Li Xian's face. They all flattered him: "Grandpa Li, Master Li, we've been waiting and waiting, and finally you've come!""You're still alive, that's wonderful! You've truly accomplished a rare deed in history!""Our Flower Cage Sect should take you as a role model! Whatever you say, we will go through fire and water for you, no matter what!"

Their words were extremely sincere, and they seemed genuinely sincere. Li Xian frowned slightly, curious and suspicious: "I heard you say I accomplished a rare deed in history? What rare deed?"

The sect members gave a thumbs-up and said, "Speaking of this matter, you are truly awesome! Looking at our Flower Cage Sect's thousands of years of history, you are the only awesome person we've had!"

Li Xian had an ominous premonition and said, "Cut the nonsense, tell me what happened quickly!"
