# Chapter 52: Startling Devour Art

"Will learning this cultivation method cause trouble?" Chen Fei asked in a low voice. Many sects would pursue leaked cultivation methods, especially those for internal energy. Back in Pingyin County, Chen Fei hadn't cared much, as it was a small place, and the chances of being discovered, even if he learned methods from other sects, were very low.

But now he was in Xingfen City, and afterward, Chen Fei would be heading to Xianyun City. With more options available, Chen Fei naturally had to be more cautious.

"The esteemed customer can rest assured," the shopkeeper said with a smile. "That sect has already fallen into disrepair, and he was the sole inheritor. You learning this secret manual won't cause any trouble; on the contrary, you'd be helping to pass on the cultivation method."

Chen Fei nodded slightly, picked up the manual, and slowly read through it. A quarter of an hour later, Chen Fei put the manual down. The manual was only one-third complete, but it already revealed quite a lot.

Naturally, it couldn't compare to the Startling Thunder Sword Force, but it was much more powerful than the Startling Suspense Force. Moreover, this "Swallowing Cloud Force" had a very special characteristic: after cultivating it, the number of pills one could consume daily could actually increase.

Simply put, the Swallowing Cloud Force allowed cultivators to absorb pills more quickly without burdening their bodies. Aside from other benefits, this single point was enough to entice Chen Fei.

Currently, Chen Fei could only take one Light Spirit Pill a day. Any more, and his meridians would swell and ache, and his whole body's qi and blood would feel abnormal. This wouldn't be a problem once or twice. But if it continued long-term, it would definitely have adverse effects on his physical body. Therefore, Chen Fei only tried it a few times before stopping, dutifully taking one Light Spirit Pill each day.

"What's the price?"

"One thousand taels." The shopkeeper's smile became even brighter.

Chen Fei also inquired about the prices of pills. In Pingyin County, a Grass Reversion Pill typically cost ten taels, but in Xingfen City, it was eight taels per pill. Light Spirit Pills also dropped from fifteen taels to thirteen taels per pill. Prices were undoubtedly much cheaper. No wonder merchant caravans traveled back and forth; with such a price difference, if the quantity was sufficient, the profits were quite substantial.

Furthermore, Xingfen City sold Ever-Floating Pills, so Chen Fei specifically bought some. Ever-Floating Pills were a bit expensive, nearly thirty taels per pill. Chen Fei bought them primarily to see if his current Muscle Refining Realm cultivation could handle Ever-Floating Pills for cultivation, and he also planned to try and decipher the Ever-Floating Pill formula.

Xingfen City didn't sell the formula for Ever-Floating Pills, which left Chen Fei somewhat disappointed. The formula for Light Spirit Pills was available, but it wasn't cheap, costing several thousand taels.

"I was a bit naive before," Chen Fei muttered to himself. "Pill formulas are high-value items everywhere."

Chen Fei murmured to himself, then tried taking an Ever-Floating Pill. An hour later, Chen Fei opened his eyes, his expression slightly disappointed. The Ever-Floating Pill's efficacy was very strong, but Chen Fei felt a swelling pain in his meridians, much more intense than taking two Light Spirit Pills consecutively. Clearly, the Ever-Floating Pill was too potent for his current Muscle Refining Realm cultivation; Chen Fei couldn't handle it yet.

Sitting cross-legged, Chen Fei circulated the Startling Devour Art. Half an hour later, he opened his eyes, a look of joy in them. His previously swollen and aching meridians had now completely returned to normal. The unabsorbed medicinal power had now fully integrated into Chen Fei's body.

"The effect is actually this significant."

Chen Fei glanced at the Ever-Floating Pill beside him, hesitated for a moment, then chose a Light Spirit Pill instead and swallowed it. As the pill's medicinal power diffused, discomfort began to appear in his meridians. Chen Fei quickly activated the Startling Devour Art. The qi and blood in his body surged rapidly, and the discomfort gradually subsided, then slowly disappeared.

Chen Fei's furrowed brow relaxed. The Startling Devour Art continuously circulated within his body, and the pill's medicinal power was rapidly absorbed, feeding into his flesh and blood.

An incense stick's worth of time passed. Chen Fei opened his eyes, slowly exhaling a turbid breath, his face unable to conceal his joy.

"I've reached the limit. One Ever-Floating Pill plus one Light Spirit Pill, and my internal energy growth has almost doubled. What originally would have taken over nine months to reach Bone Forging now only requires a little over four months."
