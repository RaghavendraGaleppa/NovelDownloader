# Chapter 69: Frostfinger

After reaching Foundation Establishment, Xiao Ji spent several days exploring Ancient City with Qian Duoyu. 

With this second-generation mining heir following him around, whenever Xiao Ji showed interest in anything, Qian Duoyu would immediately throw spirit stones at it and gift the item to him. Eventually, Xiao Ji became too embarrassed to even praise good items they came across.

They visited Ancient City's eight scenic spots and the massive dueling arena. The arena was currently inactive with no scheduled matches. While the fights there were said to be spectacular, the city generally encouraged peace - one only entered the arena for serious grudges when both parties refused to back down.

The auction house no longer held interest for Xiao Ji. He found it unsuitable for finding hidden treasures, though it served well for selling items. His auctioned goods - including top-grade bear and eagle demon cores, bear gallbladder, a twelfth-grade spider demon core, and spider venom sac - all sold within two days, earning him a substantial sum.

He discovered a more promising location: Treasure Hunt Street. 

This unassuming side street attracted poorer cultivators, functioning like a legitimate black market with reasonable prices and reliable quality. It was known for occasional bargain finds.

"Brother Xiao, do you like that pearl?" Qian Duoyu asked when he noticed Xiao Ji's gaze lingering on an item.

Xiao Ji shook his head, insisting he needed no more gifts. "If you must spend money, buy toys for your new pet instead."

Qian Duoyu's generosity stemmed from childhood lessons from his frugal mining magnate father: "To make friends, you must be generous." This created constant conflict between frugality and generosity that Qian Duoyu never resolved.

Along Treasure Hunt Street, cultivators hawked their wares on roadside stalls.

"Earth-grade technique 'Skyrend Finger Arts'! Sole surviving copy from an extinct ancient sect! Only eighty spirit stones! First come, first served!"

The loud vendor attracted a crowd drawn by the earth-grade claim. Xiao Ji and Qian Duoyu joined the onlookers.

"Let me examine it first," someone requested.

"No browsing!" the vendor refused. "What bookstore lets you read first? You might memorize it! Payment first, then goods."

This was the inherent flaw in technique transactions - no previews, pure gamble. Fakes were common.

"How do we know it's genuine?"
"If it were truly earth-grade, you wouldn't still be at Qi Refinement," critics countered.

Unfazed, the vendor retorted, "If I gave you a heaven-grade technique, could you even comprehend it?" 

His point held merit - owning a technique didn't guarantee mastery. Without comprehension, it remained worthless paper.

[Warning: 'Skyrend Finger Arts' is fake. Authored by Qi Refinement cultivator, derivative of Mountain Splitting Palm. Worth twenty spirit stones at most.]

As Xiao Ji prepared to leave, he suddenly stopped. Beneath the vendor's wares lay a tattered manual.

[Frostfinger: Heaven-grade technique. Freezes anything solid. Copied in haste by ancient thief with transposed chapters and reversed mantras, rendering it incomprehensible...]

An unexpected discovery.

Xiao Ji waited until the crowd thinned before approaching. "How much for these manuals?"

"Ten stones each," the vendor said, "but premium techniques like Skyrend Finger Arts cost extra. You seem destined for greatness, young master!"

Xiao Ji declined the sky-rending offer. "Just this one," he said casually, pointing to Frostfinger. "Something to pass the time."

Thrilled to sell what he'd planned as a freebie, the vendor offered an eight-stone discount. Thus Xiao Ji acquired a heaven-grade technique for eight spirit stones.

Though he spotted other potential bargains, most were useless to a Foundation Establishment cultivator or inferior to his golden finger ability. He also had no interest in reselling.

Now possessing two heaven-grade techniques, Xiao Ji planned to master them before leaving Ancient City. He'd hoped to collect more, but such finds required luck - heaven and earth-grade techniques weren't littered everywhere.

He also selected Wildfire Sword Arts, an earth-grade technique unsuitable for himself but perfect for Lin Musheng.

Returning to his inn, Xiao Ji secured his room and laid out his two new manuals: Stay-at-Home Guide to Thousand-Mile Steps and Frostfinger. Placing both hands on the texts, he began comprehension.

[Comprehension initiated: 1%]
[Error detected in Thousand-Mile Steps: reversed qi flow...]
[Comprehension: 67%]
[Frostfinger errors identified: transposed passages corrected...]
[Comprehension complete: 100%]

By dawn, success.

Checking his status:

[Name: Xiao Ji]
[Age: 20]
[Affiliation: Primordial Spirit Temple]
[Spiritual Roots: Erratic, variable quantity]
[Realm: Early Foundation Establishment (12/300)]
[Techniques: Heaven-Collapse Earth-Shattering Purple Gold Art, Thousand-Mile Steps, Frostfinger]
[Perception Range: 1 li]

"Finally measuring perception in li," Xiao Ji mused wearily. From inches to feet, now li - someday perhaps thousands of li. The thought exhilarated him.

"This trip was worthwhile," he concluded. "Time to return home."

After months away, he needed to return to Primordial Spirit Temple before his master forgot him entirely - or worse, passed the legacy to Ying Xiao instead.
