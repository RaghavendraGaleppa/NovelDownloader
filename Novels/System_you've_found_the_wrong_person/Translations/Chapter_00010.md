# Chapter 10: One Sword to Defeat the Enemy  

Night fell.  

Under the sparse moonlight, all was silent.  

Dou Changsheng sat by a small stream, carefully wiping the bloodstains from his sword. Though the rust on the blade would require some polishing to remove completely.  

After finishing his task, he washed his hands and splashed some water on his face, feeling refreshed after days of neglect. His appearance had been disheveled, but now he felt somewhat presentable again.  

Once done, he filled his empty water pouch with fresh stream water and secured it to his horse. The flowing stream was safe from any risk of poisoning.  

As he chewed on dry rations, Dou Changsheng reflected on the battle earlier that day.  

He had to admit, he had let his emotions get the better of him. His lack of experience had caused his rhythm to falter, but it was precisely this reckless abandon that had amplified the power of his Fearless Sword Technique.  

Looking back now, he realized that the Fearless Sword Technique and the Threefold Qi Convergence Art were a perfect match. The gradual extension of his sword’s aura was largely due to the latter.  

As long as he remained fearless—unafraid of death—he could dominate weaker opponents with ease.  

Though he had slaughtered many in the day’s battle, Dou Changsheng wasn’t arrogant enough to believe he could easily defeat a Xiantian-level warrior yet.  

His repertoire was limited to just this one sword technique. Even with an extra month’s worth of Xiantian-level internal energy, he still wouldn’t be a match for someone like Ai Haike.  

Thus, maintaining his connection with the Black Eagle Venerable was absolutely crucial.  

What he lacked most now was systematic training. For instance, while everyone knew about breaking through meridians, the specifics eluded him. What came after reaching the Xiantian stage? What was a Pure Yang Grandmaster?  

He was completely in the dark.  

This was precisely why he was willing to head to Sword Gate Pass.  

He wasn’t actually a descendant of the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou. If he had been after benefits, he would have long since fled this northern conflict. But since he was already entangled, he had to cling to the Black Eagle Venerable’s faction.  

A man must stand with the victors.  

Dou Changsheng didn’t know which of the three factions in the north would prevail. But one thing was certain: the Black Eagle Venerable would still be alive in the future.  

The Wang Clan had even invited him as a matchmaker when marrying off one of their daughters.  

Though the struggle for Sword Gate Pass was perilous, it wasn’t a death trap.  

By securing the Black Eagle Venerable’s mentorship, he could gain proper guidance.  

There was no doubt about the Black Eagle Venerable’s teaching abilities—after all, the future Dou Changsheng had made it to the Human Rankings.  

They were both Dou Changshengs, cut from the same cloth. If one could do it, so could he.  

Moreover, this would also give him access to the resources of the Black Eagle Venerable’s faction—no shortage of divine techniques or martial masters there.  

After making preparations, Dou Changsheng found a safe spot to rest.  

He sat atop a flat rock in an open area with no blind spots, his arms wrapped around his sheathed sword, eyes closed in feigned sleep. Though he wasn’t truly asleep, he remained alert to his surroundings.  

The ambush by the Black Horse Gang during the day had left him uneasy. Something told him the night wouldn’t pass peacefully.  

He had expected the Earthwalker and Windwing to strike earlier, but they had held back.  

Tonight, however, they wouldn’t hesitate. With their forces dwindling, they had to deliver results or face consequences.  

Time passed slowly until, suddenly, Dou Changsheng’s ears twitched. He heard footsteps—his enemies weren’t even bothering to conceal their approach.  

His eyes snapped open, locking onto the source of the sound.  

A silver-haired elder strode forward, a broadsword in hand.  

Ai Haike moved with the imposing aura of a seasoned warrior, gripping his weapon tightly as he raised it high. A killing intent surged forth.  

Simultaneously, a swift figure darted in like a gust of wind, covering dozens of meters in an instant. A flexible sword flickered like a venomous serpent, its deadly aura palpable.  

No words were exchanged—the attack had already begun.  

Dou Changsheng’s heart tightened.  

There was an extra enemy.  

This was no small matter. His preparations had been for the Earthwalker and Windwing alone.  

He sighed inwardly. If this had been the future Dou Changsheng, perhaps only the Earthwalker would have come. But now, he faced three Xiantian-level warriors.  

Should he flee?  

The thought barely formed before he dismissed it.  

He couldn’t outrun Windwing. Fleeing without a fight would only expose his weakness and hasten his demise.  

His only choice was to gamble everything on one desperate strike.  

Dou Changsheng abruptly stood and leaped aside just as the rock beneath him shattered. A small figure burst from the ground, its attack missing by a hair’s breadth.  

The Earthwalker rolled three times before vanishing into the earth without a trace, leaving no sign of his passage.  

Had Dou Changsheng not been prepared, the sight would have stunned him.  

But knowing his enemies’ abilities, he had already anticipated this. The moment the Earthwalker emerged, Dou Changsheng had shifted eastward. As the assassin submerged again, Dou Changsheng drew his sword and thrust in one fluid motion.  

This time, he held nothing back. His Xiantian-level internal energy erupted like a raging river, surging through the rusted blade.  

A brilliant white sword aura, nearly half a meter long, pierced the earth where the Earthwalker had vanished.  

A scream rang out—cut short almost instantly.  

Blood gushed from the ground like a geyser before quickly receding, leaving only a dark stain.  

The Earthwalker’s skills had been formidable, his earth-gliding technique near-supernatural. Without knowing its weakness, any counterattack would have been futile.  

All of this happened within a single breath.  

The enemy’s strategy had been simple: Ai Haike and Windwing would attack head-on, drawing attention while the Earthwalker struck from below.  

But Dou Changsheng had known their tactics. The Earthwalker fell to a single sword stroke.  

Windwing arrived a heartbeat later, his flexible sword weaving an intricate but ultimately weak pattern.  

Dou Changsheng felt a flicker of relief. His plan had worked.  

By killing the Earthwalker so swiftly, he had intimidated his foes, making himself appear far stronger than he was.  

This might just buy him an escape.  

His thoughts raced, but his movements never slowed. His sword lashed out, its aura extending another half-meter.  

Windwing’s sword dipped, using the ground like a springboard to launch himself backward without ever closing the distance.  

The attack missed, its radiant light fading into the night.  

Though it had failed to land, Dou Changsheng’s panic subsided.  

Had it only been the Earthwalker and Windwing, he might have stood a chance. But with Ai Haike in the mix—an unknown variable—a prolonged fight would mean certain death.  

Yet, after seeing the Earthwalker fall in one stroke, Windwing had hesitated.  

Dou Changsheng watched as Ai Haike, now lagging behind due to Windwing’s retreat, hesitated mid-charge.  

Lifting his sword, Dou Changsheng pointed it at the elder and spoke coldly:  

“I respect your family’s legacy, but that doesn’t mean I’ll tolerate endless provocations.”  

“This is your last warning. Leave now.”  

“Next time we meet, I won’t hold back.”  

Ai Haike froze, his broadsword caught between raising and lowering. His furious gaze shifted to Windwing, who was already fleeing into the darkness.  

The elder’s breath came heavy before he finally tossed his weapon aside and clasped his fists.  

“I thank you for sparing me twice,” Ai Haike said, shame coloring his voice. “I’ll take no further part in this. I return home today and shall never leave again.”  

Without retrieving his blade, he turned and left.  

Outwardly calm, Dou Changsheng finally let out the breath he’d been holding.  

Had Ai Haike attacked in rage, his true strength would have been exposed. Windwing might have fled, but he was surely watching from the shadows.  

If they realized Dou Changsheng wasn’t as strong as he seemed, they’d strike again—and he wouldn’t survive.  

Fortunately, Ai Haike had been intimidated by his bluff.  

This was the weakness of such ragtag forces—they fought well when winning, but at the first sign of trouble, fear took over.  

Dou Changsheng sheathed his sword, leaving the broadsword behind—it was too heavy for his style. As for looting the Earthwalker’s body, there was no point. The assassin had carried nothing.  

He mounted his horse and rode on, eager to put the night’s dangers behind him.  

Had he not known his enemies’ tricks, he would have died here.  

---  

In a dimly lit mountain shrine, a towering figure sat shrouded in shadow, his expression unreadable.  

Before him knelt Windwing, his forehead bloodied from pressing it into the dirt.  

A cold voice broke the silence:  

“You return not with the Pure Yang blood, but empty-handed?”  

“Is this the result you bring me?”  

Windwing trembled. “My lord, it’s not my fault! The enemy was too strong!”  

“That Dou Changsheng is no ordinary fighter—he’s a true disciple of the Xiangzhou Wang Clan, a master of the Threefold Qi Convergence Art!”  

“Ironclad Lion King Xiong, whose meridians you personally enhanced, couldn’t withstand a single strike from him!”  

“The Black Horse Gang, trained in battlefield tactics, charged with the force of an army—yet he cut through them alone!”  

“Tonight, three Xiantian warriors ambushed him. The Earthwalker died in one stroke! Had I not fled, I’d be dead too!”  

“His sword aura extended nine feet! He’s no ordinary Xiantian—he’s at the Five Qi Convergence stage, perhaps even higher!”  

“A prodigy under twenty, groomed by the Wang Clan to compete with the world’s finest! A name destined for the Human Rankings!”  

“How could trash like us hope to match him?”  

“Rumors say the Wang Clan’s current patriarch has a son—Wang Xuanli. This must be him, disguised and renamed.”  

The shadowed figure mused, “The Threefold Qi Convergence Art isn’t known for dense energy. A nine-foot aura suggests Five Qi Convergence—his internal energy has evolved into true Xiantian power.”  

“Very well. I’ll inform the Prime Minister. The Wang Clan will answer for this.”
