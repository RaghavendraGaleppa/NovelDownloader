# Chapter 137: Family Love

The two were discussing what had transpired after they were ambushed that day, how they had fallen into the God-forsaken Land, and their actions during the subsequent retreat.

These major powers were truly ruthless. To avoid greater dangers, they simply abandoned those who were captured. Even Zhang Yitian, a Tianqin native, was originally planned to be abandoned and then revived at a later cost. Luotian Temple didn't know if they possessed such means, but for now, those monks were probably done for. Unless there were individuals of high status among them, the matter would likely be left at that.

A while later, Liu Yan arrived with Tian Ling. The fairy descended from the sky, her skin luminous and attracting many gazes. Beautiful women were always the center of attention, no matter where they went.

"It's the two fairies from Tianqin. This is a rare sight on a normal day." Someone stared intently at Liu Yan and Tian Ling, their eyes filled with admiration.

Both Liu Yan and Tian Ling possessed unparalleled beauty, yet their styles were distinct. One exuded a queenly aura, igniting a desire for conquest in others, while the other was petite and incredibly adorable, inspiring a powerful urge to cherish her. Those who sought to stir up gossip had bestowed upon them the title of 'fairies'.

"Where's Zhou Xunchuan? Hasn't he returned yet?" Liu Yan's scarlet robes were like fire, and a flame pattern adorned her brow. Zhou Tian remembered this being new; perhaps Liu Yan's unique physique had awakened some divine power. Her smooth chin was slightly raised, her voice cold, and her queenly demeanor remained utterly unchanged.

"Not yet, but he's on his way. Should be soon," Zhou Zui replied. Zhou Xunchuan wasn't here presently; he was active on the fringes of the grand formation's coverage, where some scattered creatures from the God-forsaken Land and Holy Spirits roamed, allowing him to vent his combat desires.

"Zhou Tian, I heard you brought back another woman. You're truly impressive, hooking up with others even with Tian Ling here," Liu Yan bared her fangs at Zhou Tian, her words dripping with sarcasm.

"How dare I? I must be learning from you, being devoted to one person and only having Zhou Zui in your heart, right, Tian Ling?" Zhou Tian wrapped an arm around Tian Ling, who had walked over to him, and retorted mercilessly.

Many who were secretly glancing at Liu Yan and Tian Ling nearly had their eyes pop out when they saw Zhou Tian embracing Tian Ling. Many didn't know that Tian Ling was Zhou Tian's fiancée.

"Hmph, a good-for-nothing. What right does he have to be in my heart?" Liu Yan, truly a queen, didn't change her expression in the slightest, scoffing coldly.

Zhou Tian glanced at Zhou Zui, who seemed to have sealed off his five senses, pretending to hear nothing and acting like a coward. Tian Ling covered her mouth, stifling a giggle, her eyes curving into crescent moons. Zhou Tian scratched his head, realizing Liu Yan had suddenly evolved; she was now immune to such attacks.

Before the few of them could continue their playful banter, a high-pitched dragon roar echoed in the sky. In the distance, a golden divine dragon flew closer, its body hundreds of feet long, muscles robust, each scale the size of a palm, glinting with a cold luster.

"It's Zhou Xunchuan. That's his Dharma Aspect. It seems to have grown a bit larger." Someone with sharp eyes immediately recognized it, causing many to change color. A larger Dharma Aspect signified increased strength.

As it drew near, the divine dragon transformed into a human figure—Zhou Xunchuan himself. Seeing Zhou Tian, he stepped forward.

"Haha, I knew you'd be fine!" Zhou Xunchuan seemed to have just emerged from a battle; his golden armor bore many scratches, some parts even shattered.

"Third Brother, long time no see. You've gotten even handsomer," Zhou Tian greeted him with his unique choice of words.

"Haha, only Zhou Tian's words truly resonate with me." Zhou Xunchuan chuckled and walked over to Buddhist Son Sheyin.

"Sheyin, my apologies. On my way here, I encountered a Saint-level Holy Spirit. I couldn't resist and fought him, which made me late."

Buddhist Son Sheyin opened his eyes; they were incredibly clear, seemingly devoid of any impurities. "Patron Zhou, your mental state seems a bit off. Shall today's battle still proceed?"

"Of course. Since I'm here, I definitely have to fight," Zhou Xunchuan said nonchalantly.

"My temple possesses a scripture with miraculous effects for nourishing the soul. I happen to have some research into this scripture. Perhaps I can recite a passage for you." Sheyin said calmly. This was not a battle of life and death, merely a contest, and he did not wish to be accused of winning unfairly.

"Then I shall witness it." Zhou Xunchuan immediately sat down cross-legged. Sheyin wasted no time, closing his eyes once more. A reddish-golden, ancient-looking alms bowl floated above his head, suspended in mid-air, letting down wisps of Buddhist energy.

Passages of an unfamiliar ancient scripture began to sound, a peculiar language whose meaning was utterly indiscernible. Yet, all who heard it felt their minds and spirits ease considerably. Zhou Xunchuan's brow glowed, and his body became luminous. The fierce battle with the Saint-level Holy Spirit had indeed caused him significant injuries, which were now rapidly healing.

Zhou Tian, meanwhile, watched the scene before him with confusion. Weren't these two supposed to fight? How did they suddenly turn into a loving family?

"This monk isn't planning anything, is he?" Zhou Tian asked Zhou Zui beside him. He couldn't help but wonder; the scene was too bizarre.

"You're overthinking it. With so many people watching, he wouldn't dare," Zhou Zui explained.

"From what you're saying, this monk sounds pretty good. But why do other powers have such an unfriendly attitude towards Luotian Temple?" Zhou Tian asked. He hadn't seen Luotian Temple do anything outrageous recently, so why did other powers seem to hold a grudge against them?

"It's all the sins committed by their ancestors," Zhou Zui chuckled softly, explaining, "During the ancient war, the fighting was fierce, with countless casualties. Many healing holy artifacts were contributed. The Buddhist Realm possessed a holy artifact called the Seven Treasures Glazed Pool, which had miraculous effects on fleshly body reconstruction. Many powerful cultivators used it, but the Buddhist Realm had secretly placed a trick upon it, causing many powerful cultivators to convert to Buddhism after the war. Now, it's Luotian Temple, particularly the Qi Nation, where even a Heavenly Venerate-level figure has converted. That's why they hold such great dissatisfaction towards Luotian Temple."

Zhou Tian nodded. So that was it. Then it could only be blamed on the Buddhist Realm's own actions. Since Luotian Temple had inherited the Buddhist Realm's mantle, there was nothing that could be done.

While Zhou Zui explained, Zhou Xunchuan had also fully recovered. Sheyin and he both stood up from the ground, their conditions much improved. Zhou Xunchuan stretched his limbs, producing cracking sounds, and said, "Let's not delay the time of our fellow Daoists any further. Let's begin."

Sheyin nodded, a hint of battle intent also surfacing in his clear eyes.
