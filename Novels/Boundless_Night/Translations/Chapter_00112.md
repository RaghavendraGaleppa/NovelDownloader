# Chapter 112: Powerful Return

"The Wuji Scripture truly lives up to its reputation as a miraculous art!" Qin Ming exclaimed in admiration. This scripture was profound and comprehensive, with a complete system encompassing internal force techniques, defense, consciousness awakening, and more. It was a secret tome worth a lifetime of dedicated study for many geniuses!

Qin Ming found the Wuji Scripture's insights unique. Though fundamentally rooted in the element of "earth," it also contained profound research into Yin and Yang. In particular, the Wuji Scripture's explanation of the third major realm, the Spirit Field, was exceptionally profound, allowing it to be cross-referenced and verified with the Overlord's Last Will. The Overlord himself had risen to prominence starting from the Spirit Field realm.

For Qin Ming, these were still distant matters. He merely skimmed through them, temporarily taking a "long-term view" to understand what came next. His primary focus was on the present, diligently practicing the profound techniques he could master. 'Wu' represented Yang Earth, and 'Ji' represented Yin Earth, corresponding to the Yang Fist and Yin Fist respectively. If cultivated to great mastery, they could merge into the Wuji Fist. Not to mention the Wuji Fist itself, even the various fist and palm techniques derived from the Yang Fist or Yin Fist were already quite famous, such as: Nether Fist, Yin Earth Fist, Wuyang Palm, etc.

Qin Ming practiced the Yin Fist quite well, as he had previously trained in the Yellow Mud Palm, which shared similarities with the Yin Fist, both belonging to the "earth" domain. He absorbed a large amount of earth vein essence, his entire body enveloped in a yellow mist. Yin Earth force circulated, and wherever the Yin Fist reached, it was as if the Netherworld was approaching. As Qin Ming practiced the Yin Fist, his Yellow Mud Palm also improved significantly. The unique terrain here allowed him to continuously absorb the essence of the earth, providing an inexhaustible supply for his use.

"I can't neglect the Yang Fist either. I must raise it, or wouldn't I be wasting this wonderful place?" Qin Ming continuously practiced, feeling his strength increase. He had cultivated both Yin Earth Force and Yang Earth Force, and when combined, they formed Wuji Force, comparable to the Blazing Fire Force and Golden Silkworm Force. Qin Ming knew that if he also integrated the Wuji Force, his strength would definitely increase significantly. It was by merging two miraculous arts that his Heavenly Light Force underwent a qualitative change previously. He had very high hopes for this third miraculous art.

During this time, Qin Ming's mental field was constantly stimulated by the mysterious energy within the Mountain River Spirit Nest, enhancing his conscious spirit light, which then nourished his physical body. He estimated that his total strength now exceeded seven thousand jin, perhaps even more, making him as strong as, if not stronger than, someone who had undergone six rebirths. Qin Ming pondered, "Does this count as a rebirth? Nourishing and transforming the physique through conscious spirit light produced surprisingly good results." He had a feeling that this wasn't exactly a rebirth, but rather an enhancement of potential, strengthening his inherent foundation.

Qin Ming thought of his younger brother, Cui Chongxuan, who wasn't an anomaly, yet by practicing the "Six Imperial Heart Sutra," he could nourish his body and enhance his foundation, gradually transforming into an anomaly. He felt that the silk scripture was no worse than the Six Imperial Heart Sutra, and perhaps he was using this wonderful place, the Mountain River Spirit Nest, to alter his physique and thicken his inherent foundation.

Soon, Li Qingyue dispelled his doubts. She had heard some rumors and seen some records in the Outer Lands. "The patriarchs of the Heaven-Shattering Force and the Six Imperial Heart Sutra both utilized the power of the Outer Lands in their youth to enhance their initial foundations," she stated.

Qin Ming's interest was piqued. "Are there any records of how strong the foundations of such legendary figures were during their first rebirth?" he asked.

Li Qingyue replied very solemnly, "They were figures that many reborn individuals could only look up to. Their arm strength during their first rebirth already exceeded a thousand jin, making them even more formidable than anomalies, possibly even approaching eleven hundred jin. Their innate talent was unparalleled." These were records from the Outer Lands. Once such individuals matured, they became extremely dangerous existences for them.

"Legendary figures are indeed powerful," Qin Ming marveled. Up until now, he hadn't even encountered an anomaly, let alone a transcendent. Suddenly, Qin Ming felt something was off. He thought of Xiang Yiwu; with that physique, if he wasn't an anomaly, then who was? Perhaps even more formidable, it was hard to say.

Li Qingyue's expression changed, seeing how calm he was. She really wanted to know his true foundation. "How strong did they become after using the Outer Lands' methods to enhance their foundation?" Qin Ming wanted to know the answer. Li Qingyue recalled the fleeting records she had seen. "After their physique transformation, if converted to the strength they possessed during their first rebirth, it was probably around twelve hundred jin." Then, she looked curious and asked Qin Ming what level he had reached. Qin Ming didn't hide it and told her the truth.

Li Qingyue, who was always elegant and ethereal, now found herself unable to remain calm. Her fair and clear face was filled with shock, finding it hard to believe. "Your previous foundation was already over twelve hundred jin? If your foundation truly deepened here, how much will it increase to?" Li Qingyue suddenly thought that perhaps it wouldn't be bad for him to focus on the path of rebirth!

Qin Ming, however, was not so excited, because he knew very well that this path was not easy. He said, "The path you walk initially aims to be close to immortals and ultimately seeks truth. The people of the Esoteric Sect are even more fanatical, showing great disrespect to quasi-divine beings. Considering your future prospects, what is my small achievement?" Qin Ming wasn't getting carried away; he was very calm. Especially, the Night Mist World was vast and boundless, with other paths available. Their pioneering efforts had only claimed a small corner.

"You're too modest," Li Qingyue said with a smile.

"It's the truth. Thinking of the Overlord from over a century ago, what did his exceptional brilliance matter? An old senior from the Outer Lands came out and easily pulverized him. If even such a peerless figure met that fate, my heart turns cold."

"The Overlord was targeted prematurely and died too early. Otherwise, he might not have been inferior to the patriarchs of Heaven-Shattering Force and Six Imperial Force."

***

Finally, Qin Ming's mental field fluctuated violently. His conscious spirit light stopped increasing, and its nourishment of his physical body ended. Moreover, he felt a splitting headache. He knew he had reached his limit and had to leave. He was already very satisfied; his strength had significantly increased this time, and his foundation had very likely genuinely thickened!

Half an hour later, Li Qingyue also reached her limit, successfully breaking through and raising her cultivation to a new level. "What a pity for this place. When the Heavenly Light from beyond descended back then, it caused significant damage, and the remaining mysterious energy is far less than I imagined," Li Qingyue remarked, looking back.

At this moment, she and Qin Ming had already left the Mountain River Secret Nest, passing through a golden maple forest covered in yellow leaves. Xiang Yiwu appeared. "You're finally out," he said. "That beggar came by several times."

"Li Qingxu? Why was he begging?" Qin Ming asked.

"Wandering the mountains with a dog-beating stick. No, wait, a dragon-beating stick!" Xiang Yiwu corrected himself immediately after speaking. He was quite displeased. "He hit me with a stick."

Qin Ming recalled that he himself had once been hit by Li Qingxu's bamboo stick, and he felt inadvertently offended by Xiang Yiwu, yet couldn't say anything. "Were you at a disadvantage?" Qin Ming asked with concern, after all, the other party was guarding this place to help him.

Xiang Yiwu shook his head. "Not at all. If someone respects me an inch, I respect them a foot. If he hits me with one stick, I'll give him two palms."

"He's gone," Li Qingyue said, gazing at the distant mountains. Li Qingxu glanced in their direction from a mountain peak, then turned and disappeared, for he already knew that Li Qingyue had consumed the problematic spirit nest.

"Since everything's fine, I'll be off. I'm eager to refine the Golden Silkworm with Blazing Fire, allowing me to break free from my shell and soar to the heavens!" Xiang Yiwu had long wanted to leave.

Qin Ming was concerned for his safety. "Why don't you come with us? You just beat up an elite disciple. Will his sect elders come looking for trouble?"

"No matter. I'm not his follower. His lineage invited me to help. Moreover, his elders know my background and knew my former teacher. Although I'm almost an outcast now, living out in the wild, they wouldn't dare do anything to me recently." Xiang Yiwu extended his large, fan-like hand and clapped Qin Ming's palm. "Brother, you're a good person. We'll help each other on this path in the future. Wait a minute, your strength feels off. It seems quite a bit stronger than when you fought in the White Bamboo Forest."

Before leaving, the burly youth with large, bell-like eyes wore an expression of disbelief. As a disciple of the Tathagata Sect, he could perceive some essences and guessed Qin Ming's true number of rebirths. "Hiss, it seems refining the Golden Silkworm with just Blazing Fire isn't enough. I also need to quickly feed the Golden Silkworm the Eternal Green Wood Dew," Xiang Yiwu said, turning to leave.

"Brother Xiang, are you talking about another miraculous art? Let's exchange again later!" Qin Ming called out.

Li Qingyue said, "May Brother Xiang become the Tathagata of this era!"

Not long after, Li Qingyue stopped several elite disciples. Her expression was as cold as ice, and she ordered them to leave behind their protective golden robes. The expressions of the few changed. In the White Bamboo Forest, although they hadn't personally joined the fight, they had participated in the encirclement. They hadn't expected to encounter Li Qingyue here. Clearly, they had long been affiliated with the five core disciples.

One of the elite disciples was directly struck by a stream of conscious spirit light, instantly spitting out a mouthful of blood. The protective golden robe on his body emitted dazzling runic light. This meant that without such protection, he would have already died once. The next moment, he flew sideways again, struck by a five-colored mist, losing more than half his life and lying prone on the ground, unable to get up. The few were horrified. How could Li Qingyue, who had been severely wounded by the combined efforts of the five core disciples, not only be unharmed but even stronger than before? She must have broken through again; otherwise, how could she suppress an elite disciple so easily?

Subsequently, these men and women all removed their protective golden robes, facing Li Qingyue with pale faces. They all sincerely apologized, and their intention to pledge allegiance was obvious. "Were any of the elite disciples close to me killed or injured?" Li Qingyue asked.

A woman informed her, "No, they were only driven away. If that many people were killed or injured, irreconcilable conflicts would definitely arise between the various orthodoxies."

"Who is recuperating here? You must be guarding him, right?" Li Qingyue asked, recalling that she had severely wounded two core disciples.

"Ren Yiping," one of them whispered.

Li Qingyue waved her hand, signaling them to leave. Subsequently, Qin Ming also put on one of the soft protective golden robes favored by the Outer Lands disciples. Moreover, both of them wore more than one. Li Qingyue murmured, "I originally intended to have a fair duel with you all, with the victor taking the item close to immortality. But since you chose to ambush me together, I can only choose to aggressively see this through to the end."

Not long after, she stopped several golden-armored guards, engulfing them in a colorful mist, rendering them instantly immobile. Soon, both she and Qin Ming donned a layer of golden armor, their faces obscured.

Ren Yiping, as a core disciple, naturally possessed extremely profound strength. Among the various talented disciples in the Outer Lands, those who could rise were not simple individuals. He had spent most of his fortune buying a powerful medicine, and after consuming it today, the effects were immediate, and he had long since recovered. However, he wasn't in a hurry to rush to his destination. He felt that the people ahead might get into a fight, so he was patiently waiting.

Suddenly, he was struck in the back by a palm. His protective golden robe shattered, and dazzling runes burned incessantly. He coughed up blood continuously, his recently recovered body severely wounded once more. That powerful medicine... was wasted! Who was ambushing him? Ren Yiping rose from the foliage, his mouth full of blood. He looked up ahead, somewhat bewildered. It was actually two golden-armored guards? One of them appeared to be female, with a tall and slender physique that showed through even beneath the golden armor. However, a golden mask obscured her face, making it impossible to discern her features.

The next moment, the already half-crippled Ren Yiping flew horizontally again. He was kicked by the woman, and all the bones in his chest and abdomen shattered, some having already pierced his internal organs. "You..." Although he couldn't see the woman's face, he guessed who she was. "Junior Sister Li, I am willing to pledge allegiance to you from now on. I can even swear a blood oath using a forbidden art of the Outer Lands!" Ren Yiping quickly said, lowering his head in submission. Otherwise, he feared he would die here. At this moment, he was greatly alarmed. Li Qingyue had not only recovered from her injuries but had also broken through again. How could he possibly fight against this?

Finally, Ren Yiping departed in a daze, coughing up blood occasionally. He was severely injured, his foundation unstable.

Outside the Luofu Immortal Mountain ruins, someone spoke, "Li Qingyue hasn't come out yet. Should we send someone in to search, to prevent any accidents?"

"Can't a core disciple even protect herself? You said earlier that she would shine brightly in the future; that was an exaggeration!"

At this moment, Li Qingyue and Qin Ming, disguised as two golden-armored guards, were proceeding unhurriedly, approaching their final destination.
