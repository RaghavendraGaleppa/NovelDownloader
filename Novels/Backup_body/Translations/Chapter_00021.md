# Chapter 21: An Ordinary Physician, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official!

After resting, Li Zhengjing took out the Divine Movement Talisman and headed straight to Qixing Prefecture.

By evening, he finally arrived within Qixing Prefecture's borders and registered using his inner sect disciple token.

Without the Divine Movement Talisman, traveling normally and bypassing Daliang City, he would have arrived at Qixing Prefecture around this time if he had set out directly from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.

"Senior Brother Li, it's already late. Please rest for a while. I'll bring the case files to you shortly."

The county magistrate's clerk came forward to greet him, bowing as he spoke. "Tonight, a banquet has been prepared at Qinghua Tower to welcome you..."

He had once been an outer sect disciple of the Immortal Sect but, feeling hopeless about his cultivation, voluntarily left the mountain to take up this post. After twelve years, he rose to the position of clerk.

Though over fifty years old, the clerk addressed Li Zhengjing respectfully as "Senior Brother."

As an inner sect disciple of the Immortal Sect—and at such a young age—daring to take on a case involving a demonic entity at the "Inner Qi" realm spoke volumes about his extraordinary abilities and high talent.

Such a person had a bright future. If he ever reached the "True Qi" realm, even the prefect of Qixing Prefecture would have to treat him with utmost respect.

"I'm exhausted from today's journey. Let's skip the welcoming banquet," Li Zhengjing said. "Bring me the case files first. I need to review them to understand the situation and prepare myself before investigating."

Immortal Sect disciples were often proud, so refusing the banquet wasn't unexpected. The clerk simply bowed and withdrew, though he couldn't help but grumble inwardly:

"This case was reported to the Immortal Sect for assistance only the day after it occurred. It took two days for the sect to review it and send it to the Public Affairs Hall. Another day passed before someone accepted the task, and then another day for him to travel here after taking the assignment!"

"By the time this entire process was completed, how many days had already passed? The demon hasn't struck again—it's not like it built a nest here. Who knows if it's even fled the area by now?"

"What's the point of rushing to investigate at this stage?"

After the clerk left, Li Zhengjing released the wall-clinging bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree from the sack.

The bird flapped its wings excitedly. "Master, are we solving the case tonight?"

Li Zhengjing shook his head. "We'll handle the case tomorrow. Tonight, I need to send you for your 'identity change.' Otherwise, after I finish this case, I might have to wait who knows how many days for you in Qiling Prefecture."

Hearing this, the bird realized it wouldn't be involved in the case. Disappointed, it dove back into the sack and began beating up the Five Elements Creation Tree, which yelped in protest.

A short while later, the clerk returned with the case files.

"Here is also the list of constables who will accompany you tomorrow, Senior Immortal. Please review it."

He hesitated before adding, "When I went to retrieve the files earlier, I heard news from the sect. This afternoon, three other inner sect disciples accepted this case. They are traveling through the night and should arrive in Qixing Prefecture by dawn tomorrow."

"I understand."

Li Zhengjing wasn't surprised by such competition.

Tasks like compiling texts had limited slots since anyone could complete them. But missions involving slaying demons and monsters had no such restrictions. He could take the case, and so could others. Whoever succeeded in resolving it would earn the corresponding merits.

After seeing the clerk off, Li Zhengjing shouldered his pack, picked up the sack, and vaulted over the wall.

Under the moonlight, he followed the address given by the wall-climbing bird, traversing six streets before arriving at a medicinal shop.

At this hour, all shops on the street were closed, and the area was quiet and deserted.

"Spirit Official Hall?"

Confirming the location, Li Zhengjing stepped forward and knocked.

"Who is it?"

A cold, youthful voice came from inside. "It's late. If you need medicine, come back tomorrow morning. If you're sick, tough it out—come back for an appointment if you're still alive by then."

Li Zhengjing remained composed. "Li Zhengjing, inner sect disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, requests an audience with the Ghost Valley Spirit Official!"

Silence followed. After a moment, the same voice spoke again.

"There's no Ghost Valley Spirit Official here."

"I come on the orders of the White Sky Sage."

"White Sky Sage?"

The voice murmured the name. A short while later, the shop door creaked open.

A cold-faced young man stood there, his expression impatient. "He's treating a patient right now. Come in and wait."

"So you're not the Ghost Valley Spirit Official?" The wall-clinging bird poked its head out, indignant. "Then why the attitude? Riding on someone else's prestige, huh?"

"You—" The young man's face darkened, but he only snorted and turned away, heading inside.

"You're here to ask for a favor. Why provoke him?" Li Zhengjing pressed the bird down and followed into the shop.

Less than fifteen minutes later, an aged voice called from the back.

"Come in."

The young man said indifferently, "He's calling you."

"Thank you."

Li Zhengjing moved toward the back of the shop. As he lifted the curtain, the stench of blood assaulted his senses.

His pupils contracted sharply, and his grip tightened on his saber.

The wall-clinging bird shrieked in terror, its feathers standing on end.

The room reeked of blood. Three bloody animal skeletons hung on the walls.

A blood-soaked figure lay on the table, its chest and abdomen marred by a ghastly wound, organs faintly visible.

Various tools—cleavers, small knives, hooks, sharp needles—were scattered nearby.

Glass bottles filled with preserved organs, bones, eyes, and ears lined the shelves.

At that moment, the bloodied figure gasped and weakly raised a hand to cover the wound in its torso.

"Give me a moment."

The aged voice came from the figure. Its left hand—a claw covered in scales—pinched the wound shut while its right, human hand, stitched it closed.

The room fell deathly silent, as though even breathing had ceased.

The wall-clinging bird trembled, too frightened to speak.

Li Zhengjing clenched his saber, staring at the "monstrous figure." A chill crawled up his spine, spreading to the base of his skull.

The atmosphere was suffocating. Every breath felt deliberate, cautious.

Once the wound was stitched, the figure took out a porcelain vial, retrieved a round object, and inserted it into its left eye socket.

Then it struggled to sit up—revealing legs that ended in eagle talons.

It turned its gaze to Li Zhengjing and the bird.

Its left eye, with a golden pupil, gleamed with a bloodthirsty coldness.

"Don't be afraid. I'm just an ordinary, run-of-the-mill physician."

It smiled warmly, baring a mouthful of sharp fangs.

"Mother of heavens!" The wall-clinging bird flapped its wings in panic. "I want to go home! I'd rather die in the Forbidden Thunder Prison!"

"Stupid brat! What are you scared of?"

The figure raised its claw, and with a casual gesture, the bird froze mid-air before being yanked back into its grasp, stiff with terror.

"Your grandfather, the White Sky Sage, is my friend. I held you when you were still an egg—though my left hand had just been replaced with a dragon's claw back then, so I nearly crushed you..."

"Uh..." The bird trembled. "Uncle, it's late. My wife's calling me home for dinner. I've got seven nests of chicks waiting..."

"No rush, no rush. Let me take a closer look."

The figure leaned in, examining the bird.

Its golden eye gleamed coldly, making the bird's feathers stand on end as it wailed in fear.

Li Zhengjing remained still, but inwardly, he focused his mind and glanced at the golden page.

In an instant, all his inner qi surged into the golden page, where the text flickered, shifting between clarity and obscurity.

After a moment, words appeared:

**Name:** Ghost Valley Spirit Official  
**Age:** N/A  
**Cultivation:** N/A  
**Fate:** N/A  

**Warning:** Target's cultivation far exceeds your own. Analysis failed!  
Insufficient inner qi. Please replenish with twelve spirit stones!  

The golden page then reverted to its original state.

The inner qi consumed by the page was returned to him since the analysis had failed.

"After draining all my inner qi, I still need twelve spirit stones to uncover his background?"

"Just how much stronger is the Ghost Valley Spirit Official than me?"

A heavy feeling settled in Li Zhengjing's chest, as though he stood before a bottomless, blood-red abyss.

At that moment, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official turned its gaze toward him, its cold eyes seeming to pierce through everything. Yet its face bore a smile.

"Did I frighten you just now, making your inner qi surge like that?"

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official tried to appear kindly. "I may not look pleasant, but I'm actually a good person."

Li Zhengjing nodded earnestly. "With such a benevolent demeanor, Senior clearly radiates kindness and warmth!"
