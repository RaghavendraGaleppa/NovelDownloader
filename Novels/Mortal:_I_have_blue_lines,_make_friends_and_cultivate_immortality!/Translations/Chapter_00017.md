# Chapter 17: A Qi Refiner Wounds a Golden Core! The Might of Heavenly Thunder Pearls!

"This fellow is truly interesting." Nangong Wan gave Lin Yun an extra glance.

Meanwhile, Li Huayuan from the Yellow Maple Valley had an unpleasant expression. The other party's disdain for the Wind Spirit Root aptitude was practically slapping their sect in the face. As the saying goes, when beating a dog, one must consider its master's face—even if you don't respect the monk, at least respect the temple!

Lu Yunfeng was already considered one of their Yellow Maple Valley disciples now!

Arrogant! That was everyone's impression of Lin Yun!

"You bastard—" Lu Yunfeng was utterly enraged by Lin Yun's dismissive attitude. His hands gripping the flagpole suddenly shone with white light as the spiritual energy in his body surged forth like floodwaters through a broken dam, pouring frantically into the flag.

With such an immense surge of spiritual power backing it, the green light on the Azure Dragon Flag became even more dazzling, like a green sun rising within the dimly lit tower space—so bright it was hard to look at directly.

With a low roar, "Senior Brother Lu" exerted force with both hands and hurled the Azure Dragon Flag into the air. His fingers then swiftly formed seals before he pointed at the flag and shouted:

"Transform into a Dragon!"

Instantly, the Azure Dragon Flag erupted with radiant light, transforming into a massive green dragon over a dozen zhang long—lifelike, with claws bared, identical to the one embroidered on the flag's surface.

"He's attacking!"

"That Wind Spirit Root guy is furious!"

"Such powerful spiritual pressure!"

"As expected of a top-tier magical artifact!"

"If Lin Yun still thinks he can rely on those low-grade talismans to win, that's impossible now!"

"Ah—after all, he's just a rogue cultivator. He can't compare to these clan cultivators with their top-tier artifacts."

"Getting serious now? Unless you can pull out hundreds more low-grade talismans, this battle is already decided." Dong Xuan'er studied Lin Yun with curious eyes.

"This Wind Spirit Root youngster is quite interesting. Combined with that Azure Dragon Flag, his strength is even more formidable." The Golden Core cultivator from the Clear Void Sect, Fu Yunzi, stroked his beard. "Old Ghost Li, if I recall correctly, your Yellow Maple Valley doesn't have a Wind-attribute Golden Core, does it?"

"Our Clear Void Sect happens to have one. Why not hand this boy over to us?"

"Get lost! We finally have a Wind Spirit Root disciple—if I let you whisk him away, how am I supposed to explain that to the sect?" Li Huayuan waved his hand dismissively.

Clearly, none of them believed Lin Yun could win.

Nangong Wan glanced at Lu Yunfeng but ultimately kept her gaze on Lin Yun. She was curious about how he had so many talismans. "Could this man be a talisman master?" she wondered.

---

"Go!" Without hesitation, Lu Yunfeng pointed forward, and the green dragon immediately opened its maw and lunged viciously at Lin Yun.

"All flash, no substance!" Lin Yun scoffed, pulling out another batch of talismans—this time, not just low-grade, but mid-grade and even high-grade ones as well.

Whoosh—whoosh—whoosh—

Boom—boom—boom—

As Lin Yun activated and hurled the talismans, explosions erupted continuously in mid-air.

"Brother Lin has so many talismans?!" Han Li, standing behind Lin Yun, was stunned, rooted to the spot.

He stared dumbfounded as Lin Yun tossed out talismans like they were free.

A single high-grade attack talisman cost at least fifty or sixty spirit stones. The ones Lin Yun had already thrown were worth hundreds. Hadn't Brother Lin said talismans were precious?

"Boom—"

"Roar—"

Under the relentless bombardment, the green dragon finally couldn't maintain its form. With a mournful cry, it disintegrated.

"How does this guy have so many talismans?!" Even the Golden Core elders on the viewing platform were shocked. "Not just low-grade—there are mid-grade and high-grade ones mixed in too!"

"Where would a rogue cultivator get the spirit stones to buy so many?"

Before they could ponder further, Lin Yun showed no signs of stopping. He flung out another wave of talismans—low, mid, and high-grade—encircling Lu Yunfeng.

Seeing this, Li Huayuan instantly moved to shield Lu Yunfeng.

This disciple was betrothed to the Chen family's young lady. The Chen family's ancestor had personally asked him to look after the boy. If he died here, Li Huayuan wouldn't be able to explain it.

At first, Li Huayuan intended to casually deflect the talismans. But then his spiritual sense detected something—hidden beneath the talismans were ten Heavenly Thunder Pearls.

Before he could react, a blinding white light erupted, illuminating the entire Tai Nan Mountain tower.

"BOOM—"

The thunderous explosion from ten Heavenly Thunder Pearls shook the entire structure.

"Heavenly Thunder Pearls?! And not just one or two?!" The Golden Core elders, previously composed, shot to their feet in shock.

---

If there had been any more, even they might have been caught off guard and obliterated!

"What a bold move!" Nangong Wan praised Lin Yun. "To gather ten Heavenly Thunder Pearls—impressive!"

"And judging by how effortlessly he threw those talismans, my guess must be right. He must be a talisman master!"

"How rare—I didn't expect our Yue Kingdom to have such a young talisman master!"

As the light faded, a disheveled Li Huayuan emerged, his face dark with fury. His robes were tattered, his hair singed into a wild mess, and a trickle of blood ran from his lips.

"Hahaha—" Fu Yunzi's laughter rang out. "Fellow Daoist Li, your new look is quite... striking!"

"To think a mere Qi Refiner could outmaneuver you!"

"Shut your mouth, you old goat!" Li Huayuan snapped back, inwardly cursing his luck. "Did I forget to check the almanac today? How did I end up humiliated by a junior?!"

His skin stung from minor burns, and he quickly swallowed a healing pill. Three mid-grade defensive talismans had been reduced to ashes at his feet.

As for Lu Yunfeng? The man was already dead. Li Huayuan had barely saved himself—how could he have protected someone else? Even the Azure Dragon Flag had been destroyed.

Lin Yun observed Li Huayuan and the mangled corpse of Lu Yunfeng. He had anticipated the Yellow Maple Valley's intervention, hence the hidden Heavenly Thunder Pearls.

If a Foundation Establishment cultivator had stepped in, they'd have been killed. Against a Golden Core, it was enough to make them suffer.

Why not use more to take down the Golden Core? Lin Yun knew better. Killing a Foundation Establishment disciple was one thing—killing a Golden Core elder would mean war.

One had to know where to draw the line.

"A mere Qi Refiner, yet he made a Golden Core elder so disgraced! This man is terrifying!"

Zhou Qingning, Dong Xuan'er, and the other cultivators gasped, their eyes wide with shock.

"Brother Lin... is this strong?!" Han Li was equally stunned.

---

Lin Yun's battle tactics left a deep impression on him. Once he stabilized his cultivation, he too would stockpile talismans to emulate such dominance!

Meanwhile, Elder Wang, who had restrained Chen Qiaoqian, stood frozen.

Lu Yunfeng was dead? Even with a Golden Core elder stepping in, he still died?!

He hastily released Chen Qiaoqian. This was a disaster!

Not only had their scheme failed, but they'd lost a promising disciple and offended the Chen family's young lady!

"Useless trash!" Elder Wang inwardly cursed the deceased Lu Yunfeng.

Li Huayuan, meanwhile, glared at Lin Yun, his body trembling with rage. Humiliated in public and mocked by Fu Yunzi—how could he stay calm? A Golden Core elder wounded by a Qi Refiner? There was no room for reason here!

"Boy! You killed a disciple our sect had marked for recruitment, and you've made a fool of me! Do you have any idea how you're going to appease my wrath?!" Li Huayuan's voice was icy, his Golden Core pressure bearing down like a mountain.

The surrounding rogue cultivators sighed. This was the tragedy of being unaffiliated.

Han Li's heart sank. "This is bad! Brother Lin has truly provoked a Golden Core monster!"

"That pressure... there's no resisting it. A Golden Core elder is truly terrifying!"

Yet Lin Yun remained calm, a faint smile on his lips. "How terrifying, Elder," he said pointedly. 

"Who knew the Yellow Maple Valley was so righteous?"

"A Golden Core elder personally intervening in a duel between two Qi Refiners?"

"What a model for us cultivators!"

Li Huayuan recognized the mockery—Lin Yun was calling him out for bullying the weak. Furious, he raised a hand to teach the boy a lesson.

But three voices cut in simultaneously:

"Elder Li, wait!"

"Fellow Daoist Li, hold on!"
