# Chapter 77: Di Xuansha

"You all?" Yang Ji stared in astonishment at the white-haired elder and the others. He had some understanding of their strength; how could all of them be severely wounded in one-on-one combat? The Eight City Lords of Eight Profound City weren't strong enough to achieve such a feat. Yet, at this moment, the white-haired elder and the others were gravely injured, and the seven City Lords of Eight Profound City had all vanished, replaced by an unfamiliar, sinisterly charming man. As the black mist, into which the little girl had transformed, merged into the sinisterly charming man, information immediately appeared: [Different hearts, one entity; one entity, eight facets; all eight facets exquisite.] [Lethal Weapon!]

"Such a powerful aura, such strong killing intent. Not good!"

Just as Yang Ji gazed, an astonishing killing intent surged forth from the man before him, like a sharp arrow. The killing intent, twisted into a sharp sword, was so keen that it created the illusion that anyone who received it would surely die. Yang Ji rapidly retreated, simultaneously sweeping out two sword beams from his flying sword, meeting the earth-shattering killing intent.

Boom!

The air detonated, like a dust explosion, as sparks of light flickered in the air, and a massive shockwave spread in all directions. Yang Ji was blasted back five *zhang* away, his internal aura now chaotic. He was secretly shocked. One must know that his physique was as strong as a high-grade spirit artifact, yet at this moment, his blood was surging, his muscles trembling, and even his bones creaked. The impact of this killing intent was truly formidable.

Sinking his Qi to his Dantian, Yang Ji quickly adjusted his breathing. Looking intently as the dust settled, a man wreathed in overwhelming killing intent and red light appeared before him. This killing intent did not stem from hatred, but was an aura naturally exuded from having killed too many people. The man before him seemed like a God of Slaughter, having slain an unknown number of people, with their vengeful spirits coiling around him, transforming into roaring red light.

The man held a pair of black and white swords, dressed in sleek, tight-fitting black clothes, with a patterned black band tying back his long hair from his forehead. His eyes were deep and dark, like portals opening into the abyss of hell. The god-like man of slaughter glanced at Yang Ji, who immediately felt the profound sword intent hidden deep within the man's eyes. This sword intent, already materialized, only revealed itself when his gaze fell upon something.

Realm: Peak Golden Core.
Strength: Five times that of a Peak Golden Core.

This was Yang Ji's evaluation.

"You are strong, capable of receiving a strike of my killing intent. I have been dormant for a long time; it was you who awakened me."

The man, like a God of Slaughter, eyed him askance, holding his sword in one hand, pointing it at Yang Ji. "I have no grievances with you, but since you awakened me, then let me test this long-dormant sword in my hand. This is destiny."

Killing intent surged, the air turned sharp, and fierce winds swept over, surprisingly leaving white marks on the skin.

***

At the same time, the flying sword in Yang Ji's hand actually began to tremble. This trembling did not stem from fear, but from the flying sword's spiritual connection with its wielder, the sword responding to its master's excitement. Guided by sword intent, the sword intent within Yang Ji also surged forth, forming a Sword Domain.

"First Slash: Edge!"

The god-like man of slaughter suddenly looked up, a cold light flickered from his hand, and an astonishing rainbow of light instantly appeared. The gods in heaven were silent, and the entire sky of cold light changed color. The man attacked in a flash, his momentum like a rainbow, his single sword directly shattering Yang Ji's Sword Domain. The Sword of Death instantly reached his eyes. That streak of sword light, which made heaven and earth lose color, was incredibly fast. In an instant, it had reached Yang Ji's glabella, a three-foot-long sword pointing directly at the retreating Yang Ji, as crisis suddenly arose.

Fast, too fast!

Yang Ji had not even clearly seen how he drew his sword; the sword light simply appeared and pointed directly at his glabella. A tiny bloodstain had already appeared on his glabella, pierced by the killing intent. Spreading his sword wings, he pushed his speed to the limit, raising his sword to block as he retreated. The two clashed and separated in an instant.

"Countless souls have perished under my sword. Do not evade, though evading would be useless anyway!"

The God of Slaughter's cold words made Yang Ji feel immense pressure, pressure so extreme. With just a casual thrust of his sword, he saw death beckoning, truly terrifying.

"Second Slash: Sharpness!"

The God of Slaughter's killing intent erupted as he raised his sword and attacked again, arriving in an instant. It was but one sword, yet few could withstand it.

"Sword Across the Void!"

Yang Ji leaped up, sword intent surging, raising his sword to meet the attack, his battle intent surging like a mighty river, unwilling to show weakness.

"Third Slash: Slaughter!" "Li Sword Dao!"
"Fourth Slash: Flesh!" "Xun Sword Dao!"
"Fifth Slash: Will!" "Zhen Sword Dao!"
"Sixth Slash: Grudges!" "Dui Sword Dao!"
"Seventh Slash: Life!" "Li-Xun Sword Dao!"
...

Yang Ji clashed with the God of Slaughter using his "Guizang Sword Art," sparks flying and lightning flashing all the way. The two exchanged countless moves in an instant. He was secretly shocked. The killing intent of the man before him was too strong, too dense, protecting his entire body impermeably, without the slightest weakness. This was the strongest opponent of the same cultivation level he had encountered so far. The man's strength astonished him. To defeat him, the only way was to break through his sword.

"You can withstand several of my moves. Your sword is a good one, but unfortunately, it hasn't drunk enough blood, and too few heads have fallen to it. It has sufficient sharpness, but its killing intent is still lacking."

The God of Slaughter looked up, his eyes now completely bloodshot, resembling a purgatory within, where eight different individuals enacted different tragedies.

"However, you have earned the right to know my name. The one who will kill you is Di Xuansha!" the God of Slaughter declared with soaring momentum.

***

Yang Ji frowned, feeling as though he wasn't one person, but eight. His body felt like a cage, imprisoning eight different personalities, eight consciousnesses that he could command at will. It was truly bizarre.

"This black sword killed one hundred and thirty-six enemies for survival. This white sword killed one hundred and fifty-four enemies for cultivation. You, I find very satisfactory; you can merge with me, become a part of me."

Di Xuansha slightly turned sideways, pointing his single sword straight ahead, a disdainful posture naturally emanating from him.

"A destiny born for slaughter. Slaughter is merely your shell. All I see is the sword's edge, not the person wielding it. A generation's Sword King, yet lamentably reduced to a slave of slaughter. The sword's edge can never conceal the weakness in your heart!"

Yang Ji watched the eight tragic fates constantly playing out in Di Xuansha's eyes, raised his sword obliquely, and spoke thus.

"Hm?" Di Xuansha's aura fluctuated throughout his body. With his black sword pointed diagonally, his killing intent intensified. "I despise the persistence of the weak. The weak should become souls beneath my sword!"

Di Xuansha's aura surged violently, red light and black flames intertwined around his body. Killing intent and malevolent aura coexisted, his momentum amplified to its peak.

"Eighth Slash: Human Soul!"

Di Xuansha split into eight, and the eight figures attacked together, their momentum shaking heaven and earth. One sword strike, instantly deciding life or death; this was the Sword of Slaughter.

"That sword!" The white-haired elder and the others watching the battle felt their hearts sink, secretly lamenting how dire the situation was. This sword's killing intent was boundless, its sword energy merged into the void; it was too powerful. It was stronger and more terrifying than the move the sinisterly charming youth had used against the young woman in tight-fitting attire. The young woman in tight-fitting attire saw this scene, and her face also paled slightly.

Yang Ji saw him attack, his expression also slightly changed, but there was no fear in his eyes. His entire body erupted with sword intent, unleashing a devastating sword strike that merged the four Sword Daos of the Guizang Sword Art. Man and sword became one as he charged towards Di Xuansha.
