Chapter 180: The Third Round

On the many viewing platforms in the outer space of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, silence reigned. All the cultivators stared at Zhang Jing and the two others sitting opposite each other on Hero Island, their gazes filled with bewilderment. At this moment, their hearts were consumed by doubt and surprise. Who were these three individuals? Where did they even come from? Whether it was the previously renowned Human Race's Ten Foundation Establishment Prodigies, or the powerful races from the Myriad Spirits Faction, before entering the secret realm, the universally recognized favorites to contend for first place in Foundation Establishment seemed like a joke in front of these three. Crucially, no one had ever mentioned the names of these three before. Such a bizarre situation caused everyone's minds to fall into a daze.

Amidst the crowd, a charming woman's delicate face subtly flushed with excitement, her eyes brimming with pride. Beside her, a man's eyes were vacant.

In the upper viewing areas, excited discussions rose and fell. When they had seen that mysterious woman earlier, despair and helplessness had filled everyone's hearts. What an utter disgrace it would be if a secret realm meant to test geniuses within the esteemed Human Race territory allowed a being from the Myriad Spirits Faction to stand at the very peak! But now... all negative emotions had been replaced by a surge of excitement. Two against one. This should be stable now, right? At the very least, it wouldn't be too embarrassing if the news got out. After all, being crushed by an opponent was entirely different from regrettably losing.

And in a certain corner, "Haha, Junior Brother, did you see that? One of those three is actually from our Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect! This is the true monstrous prodigy I told you about, the one cultivating in a Grotto-Heaven! Good, good, haha!" "I wonder which Grotto-Heaven this Foundation Establishment Junior Brother comes from!" The Senior Brother's face was flushed with excitement. He completely failed to notice that You Yuanming, beside him, had a frozen gaze.

Below Hero Island, silence reigned. After a long while, "Another one..." "Heh, just how many monstrous prodigies have participated in this Proud Cloud Secret Realm? The Human Race's Ten Foundation Establishment Prodigies, plus those monsters from the Myriad Spirits Faction, were already numerous and terrifying enough. Now you're suddenly telling me those were just appetizers, and the true powerhouses are only just beginning to appear?! Haha, this old man isn't playing anymore..."

In another corner, Ji Jiulin slowly regained his senses. He looked at Qu Junhou beside him, forced a strained smile, and said faintly, "Evidently, a Ninth-Rank!" Opposite him, Qu Junhou nodded, an expression uglier than crying instantly appearing on his face. He, too, had recognized Zhang Jing from the rainbow light that had just flashed past, and it was also the first time he had truly felt the terrifying aura emanating from him. At that moment, Qu Junhou instantly understood what his teacher had meant when he said Zhang Jing's strength was terrifying. "That old swindler! Why didn't he say so earlier? Was he afraid of striking at my Dao Heart?" he gritted his teeth inwardly.

Time slowly flowed. Although the Mind Demon Illusion was terrifying, it was gradually broken through with the cooperation and repeated attempts of many cultivators. As the number of participants increased, Hero Island, despite being only a thousand feet in area, gradually became crowded and lively. However, even so, there was one place on the island that had become a forbidden zone, where few dared to approach: the very center of Hero Island. There, three figures sat opposite each other. It wasn't that Zhang Jing and the others forbade others from coming over; rather, almost no one could endure the terrifying aftershocks of the auras that occasionally collided between them. Of course, ninety-nine percent of the credit for this went to Ji Changyu. Zhang Jing could swear that this person was absolutely the most exaggerated battle maniac he had ever seen since stepping onto the immortal path. He had no idea how Ji Changyu, a dignified prince of the Human Emperor's Dao Court, had developed such a battle-crazed nature. Hero Island was only so big; there was no escaping, nowhere to hide. Out of helplessness, Zhang Jing and Chang Jin had no choice but to take turns 'sparring' with him every few days. On this day, as if sensing something, the trio's eyes simultaneously opened.

Below the island, "Whew~ I've finally emerged from this Mind Demon Illusion..." A man wiped the fine beads of sweat from his forehead. His Dharma robe was now tattered, covered in marks from fire, lightning, and sand abrasion. The hardship of his journey was evident. However... the man couldn't help but look up at Hero Island directly above him, and a flicker of excitement immediately crossed his face. Everything was worth it. After passing through the Mind Demon Illusion space, there were no longer any obstacles on the path to Hero Island. One hundred million Qi Luck, and the Proud Sun Seal! Thinking of this, the man instantly transformed into a streak of rainbow light, rapidly soaring towards Hero Island above.

Yet at this moment, the sky suddenly darkened. The colossal face of the Secret Realm Spirit slowly emerged, covering all sight. Following that was a vast voice. "The ten-day limit has arrived!" A gaze as heavy as a mountain descended. In an instant, countless white lights flared brightly. "No!!!!" A desperate shriek suddenly echoed through the sky. The man's eyes were bloodshot, staring fixedly at the island just three feet in front of him. His gaze was filled with unwillingness, regret, and even resentment. Just three feet! Just a thousandth of a breath away! He could have stepped onto Hero Island. But... he involuntarily looked at the white light enveloping him. The man's figure slowly vanished, leaving behind only a bitter laugh.

"The number of qualifiers for the second round is eight thousand nine hundred and fifty. The one hundred million Qi Luck reward can be claimed upon exiting the secret realm. The Proud Sun Seals are now being distributed." Along with the vast voice of the Secret Realm Spirit, a golden seal, intricately woven with complex Dao patterns and emitting profound, elusive fluctuations, slowly appeared before everyone. Zhang Jing couldn't help but look at the Proud Sun Seal in front of him. Its appearance was somewhat similar to the partial Proud Sun Seal that had previously appeared in his Sea of Consciousness, but its Dao patterns were far more intricate. Moreover... the golden auspicious clouds supporting the golden sun below became clearer and more vividly profound. As Zhang Jing pondered, the Proud Sun Seal in his hand slowly floated up, then transformed into a dazzling golden radiance and directly drilled into his glabella. Within his Sea of Consciousness, a brilliant golden light slowly emerged, then began to wander aimlessly, as if searching for something. However, the next moment, under Zhang Jing's control, the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dao Seed, which was circling beside the mysterious jade talisman, trembled slightly. It immediately moved into his Sea of Consciousness and directly devoured the golden light. Before long, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes. "Compared to devouring the Partial Proud Sun Seal, the transformation effect produced by the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dao Seed after devouring the Proud Sun Seal this time is more than ten times stronger. It seems the appearance of the first Immortal Seed is not far off now," he mused inwardly, a faint flicker of joy and excitement in his eyes.

Time slowly passed. Everyone gradually regained consciousness. Above the sky, a smile suddenly appeared on the colossal face of the Secret Realm Spirit. However, this smile lasted for less than a breath before being replaced by a serious expression. A grand and icy voice once again reverberated. "The third round of competition now begins!" "Among you, only the strongest one hundred individuals will qualify to participate in the final ranking battle. All others will be eliminated." As the voice rang out, on Hero Island, most people's faces instantly paled, their eyes rapidly dimming.
