# Chapter 66: A Sweet Taste from Green Plum

Zhang Yunyi’s face immediately turned cold the moment he saw her.

The Young Master Zhang had wanted to burn his own father alive. That incident had inflicted immense psychological damage on him.

Young Master Zhang had been executed under Zhang Yunyi’s own supervision, beaten into a pulp by villagers with stones.

Consequently, he had developed a deep aversion toward his daughter-in-law as well.

Chen Wan walked in gracefully, her beautiful face as cold as ice.

“The door is open,” Master Zhang habitually commanded.

Their relationship was unique, so they had to be careful about minor etiquette to avoid gossip.

Chen Wan stopped the closing door, then walked up to him.

After a moment of hesitation, she gathered her courage and said to Zhang Yunyi, “Father-in-law, this daughter-in-law wishes to return to her natal family tomorrow.”

“Why?” Zhang Yunyi frowned.

In this era, the constraints of etiquette were relatively relaxed.

Even in the Southern Dynasties of the Central Plains, where the scholar class was powerful and highly advocated for rites and laws, it was still common for widows to remarry.

The situation was even more lenient in the northern and western regions.

However, returning to one’s natal family and remarrying were two different things.

Typically, only daughters-in-law who found it impossible to continue living in their husband’s family would be forced to make such a choice.

Of course, if she returned to her natal family and had a son, the child had to be left with the husband’s family.

As for the dowry she brought upon marriage, she had full authority to take it back.

Chen Wan said coldly, “This daughter-in-law’s husband is already dead.

Returning to my natal family now is merely a matter of informing you, Father-in-law. Is there any other reason required?”

These words ignited a sudden fury in Zhang Yunyi’s heart.

Actually, he knew why Chen Wan wanted to return.

Her relationship with Zhang Xinran had been quite good.

She couldn't accept that her husband had been beaten to a pulp by his own father-in-law’s men.

Moreover, because of this incident, not only had her in-laws become cold toward her, but the entire Zhang family blamed her husband for their downfall.

She suffered endless disdain while living in the Zhang household.

Life was so oppressive that she naturally wanted to leave.

From Zhang Yunyi’s perspective, even though he appeared indifferent to everything, he was actually much more sensitive than before.

Chen Wan’s defiance was a painful trigger for him, especially after he had lost his authority.

Furthermore, Chen Wan was the daughter of the Chen family of Pingliang Commandery. If she left, she would take a large portion of her dowry with her.

This was something the current Zhang Yunyi could not tolerate.

Looking at the enchanting beauty under the lamplight, whose face was filled with an indescribable disgust and coldness toward him, Zhang Yunyi’s face twisted into a grimace, and his eyes burned like ghostly flames.

“Your husband is dead, so you want to leave? Can you really not live without a man?

Fine! Then this old man will give you a man in return!”

With a heart full of rage, Zhang Yunyi lunged at her.

This Chen Wan possessed breathtaking beauty.

The former Zhang Yunyi would not have dared to touch her privately. Even during major family gatherings, he wouldn't have looked at her twice.

But now, he had no scruples whatsoever.

The weeping and cries for help in the study were soon replaced by suppressed moans.

Because the house was small and crowded, the study area was not quiet.

Especially since the door hadn't even been closed.

Surely, the servants outside had heard something, but no one dared to utter a word.

Zhang Yunyi had truly “achieved great enlightenment” now.

His “great enlightenment” meant completely abandoning all responsibility, duty, and sense of honor.

He had completely transformed into a beast—a beast living wildly for the sake of desire.

***

Yang Can returned to his residence.

He pushed the door open but didn't see the Persian cat.

Shouldn't she be waiting here respectfully, helping him take off his robe, and then handing him a cup of perfectly warm tea?

She really was a handful!

He had long seen that the girl was unruly.

But since he had paid money for her, shouldn't she do what she was supposed to do?

He hadn't forced her to sleep with him; what was so humiliating about making the bed and folding the quilts?

Tomorrow, he would have Little Green Plum discipline her.

Yang Can felt that letting Little Hot Pepper handle this Persian cat should do the trick.

He walked past the screen and saw light coming from the bedroom.

Could it be that she was waiting in the bedroom?

Was this Persian cat actually that sensible?

Yang Can hadn't planned on forcing her, but if this Persian cat offered herself up, he wouldn't refuse.

A woman who knew the score so well wouldn't need a lesson from Little Hot Pepper tomorrow.

Yang Can thought this as he walked into the bedroom. He saw a girl squatting in front of the bed, mixing hot water in a wooden basin.

She had her back to Yang Can. Her pomegranate-colored skirt was hitched up to her knees to keep it off the floor.

As a result, her round, plump buttocks were presented like a target.

However, although they were shaped like peaches, those peaches were still somewhat green and not yet fully ripe.

“Green Plum?”

Yang Can was greatly surprised. He had thought it was the Medusa, but he never expected it to be Little Green Plum.

Although they were familiar with each other, Green Plum had never prepared foot-washing water for him before.

Green Plum stood up upon hearing his voice and gave Yang Can a sweet smile.

“The foot-washing water is ready. Come soak your feet.”

Yang Can scanned the room. There was no sign of Hanabil.

He understood then that Little Green Plum had sent her away.

Green Plum clearly felt a sense of crisis, which was why she was acting so humble, even taking on the task of washing his feet.

Yang Can understood Green Plum’s thoughts and couldn't help but laugh inwardly.

However, he didn't say anything to ruin the mood.

If he made Little Green Plum angry and embarrassed, how could he enjoy such attentive service?

Yang Can nodded and walked over calmly, sitting down on the edge of the bed.

He acted as if he were already accustomed to her serving him.

Green Plum acted very naturally too. As soon as Yang Can sat down, she obediently squatted down to untie his cloth socks.

She had originally served Suo Chanzhi this way; now she was just serving a different person. What was there to be uncomfortable about?

Of course, if it weren't for the faint flush of crabapple red on her face, her reasoning might have been more convincing.

“I, your girl, can bend and stretch. I’ll give you a little taste today to avoid you looking for trouble.

One day, I will ride on your head and lord over you.”

Green Plum set a flag for herself just like her mistress, which made her feel much more at ease.

Yang Can looked at Little Green Plum, who was lowering her eyes and washing his feet, and suddenly felt that things weren't so bad as they were now.

Although danger and risk existed simultaneously, wasn't life now worlds apart from before?

If there’s danger, just sweep it away!

***

Yang Can woke up leisurely in the morning. Little Green Plum wasn't beside him.

The sweet taste the little girl offered was washing his feet personally.

Then she had carried the basin of water and left. Just left...

Yang Can waited for a long time. Confirming that she wasn't coming back, he went to sleep disappointed.

When he got up early, Little Green Plum appeared again with the Medusa.

It was unknown what Little Green Plum had said to the Medusa, but this Persian cat seemed less resistant to Yang Can than before.

She imitated Green Plum and began to serve Yang Can washing his face, brushing his teeth, and changing clothes.

It seemed she had accepted her fate.

Yang Can looked at such a seductive Persian cat and felt very helpless.

A bowl of “Golden Broth and Jade Delicacies” was right at his lips, but he couldn't eat it. Was there ever a master as frustrated as him?

He glanced at Little Green Plum. She seemed to know she was in the wrong and avoided his gaze.

Forget it. The meat was already in his pot. If he rushed, he might burn his mouth.

Yang Can comforted himself this way.

***

Having finished dressing, Yang Can walked out of the bedroom and strolled toward the central courtyard.

Like a lion king patrolling his territory at dawn.

Before dawn, before the master woke up, the rough maids and servants had already started working.

The servants in charge of the gate and courtyard opened the side and corner doors and swept the internal and external pathways.

The kitchen laborers and firewood grannies lit the stoves and drew water from the well.

The cooks and kitchen helpers prepared the ingredients for breakfast, washing rice, vegetables, and kneading dough...

When Yang Can got up, the personal maids took the stage.

Little Green Plum and the Persian cat finished the tasks of attending to his washing and dressing.

When Yang Can walked out of the bedroom, the servants in charge of the hall were wiping the furniture and arranging vases.

The aroma of dishes nearing completion wafted from the kitchen.

Green Plum began to inspect various places, dispatching the maids and grannies.

The gatekeeper began receiving fresh vegetables and meat sent from the manor.

The stableman fed the horses and checked the carriage in case the master needed to travel at any moment.

Everything was silent, like a silent, precise machine in operation.

Of course, since everyone had just arrived, they weren't familiar with the environment yet.

And some servants hadn't served people before, so they still needed guidance.

The loudest noise in the morning came from the central courtyard, where Leopard Head was leading a group of guards in their morning training.

This scene gave Yang Can a sense of déjà vu.

However, these guards were all soldiers personally selected by Leopard Head for him.

By using them, Yang Can was binding himself to their families.

This helped him put down roots in Feng'an Manor.

Most people on Longshang knew some martial arts, and these guards were particularly skilled.

Under the strict guidance of Leopard Head, they were training very hard.

Old Xin was chopping firewood in the woodshed.

One of his legs was lame, causing his shoulders to rise and fall as he walked.

This was indeed unsightly. When arranging the servants last night, Leopard Head had noticed it.

But this Old Xin was a bonus item given to Master Yang by Manager Qian and couldn't be returned.

Leopard Head could only send him to the woodshed.

Moving less would prevent him from embarrassing the master with his limping.

The woodshed gate was open, and split firewood lay scattered on the ground.

The axe wasn't very sharp. This Old Xin had an arm as strong as a qilin’s and was truly powerful.

Looking at the vigorous training guards in the training ground, Old Xin shook his head slightly, his expression somewhat disdainful.

This was just a fleeting change in his expression, but Yang Can, who was slowly walking to the side of the training ground, happened to see it.

Yang Can’s heart stirred slightly.

This firewood chopper seemed to have a story too.

Yang Can secretly noted him but didn't call him over for questioning immediately.

These people didn't have a sense of belonging to the Yang Manor yet, so he couldn't be too hasty.

Yang Can wasn't in a hurry about some things, but “Master Shan’s” business was urgent now.

He had sold this batch of “mountain goods” very hastily because the Yu family was transferring the trade route to the Suo family.

The Yu family was good at farming, while the Suo family was good at business.

The Second Master of the Suo family was now rolling up his sleeves and preparing to show his skills.

For small merchants, the Suo family’s series of actions wouldn't have much impact.

But for large, established trading firms, the impact was huge.

This mysterious “Master Shan” certainly didn't just deal in “mountain goods.”

His main business was already being squeezed. Once the Suo family got established and monopolized the Tianshui trade route, his “mountain goods business” would likely not escape their notice.

Therefore, he needed to rush to get several more batches of goods out before the Suo family finished their layout.

Especially the batch of goods he had hoarded and refused to trade until now.

That was why this “mountain goods transaction” seemed particularly rushed.

So rushed that he couldn't make more meticulous arrangements, nor did he dare to send more men.

Because the Suo family had taken over the trade route now. If he moved with a hundred or so guards, how could he transport mountain goods?

He wouldn't be able to hide anything.

At this moment, his caravan was already less than two hundred miles away from Feng'an Manor.
