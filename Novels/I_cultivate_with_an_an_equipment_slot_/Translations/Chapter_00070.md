# Chapter 70: The Astonishment of Four Perfectly Mastered Spells

The Qingheng Sect had seven Golden Core cultivators in total. However, these seven rarely appeared in the sect at the same time under normal circumstances. After all, both the Qingheng Market and the frontlines bordering the Tianmu Mountain Range required Golden Core cultivators to maintain order.

Whenever all seven Golden Core cultivators gathered, it signified a major event. The last time had been when Zhang Yan became Zhuge Wan's disciple. The Golden Core cultivators had shown up out of courtesy. This time, however, they had gathered for official business—someone was nominating a disciple to become a True Disciple of the Qingheng Sect.

Nominating a True Disciple was a significant matter for the entire sect. The seven Golden Core cultivators present all wore solemn expressions.

Mo Changqing, seated at the head of the table on the left, took a sip of spirit tea before speaking. "I assume everyone knows why we've gathered today. Our sect has enough resources to support one more True Disciple. Does anyone have a suitable candidate in mind?"

As he spoke, his gaze subtly flickered toward a white-bearded elder beside him. Despite his advanced age, the elder was muscular, resembling a martial artist more than a Daoist. His face was stern and resolute—this was Lei Kunhai, the Peak Master of the Thousand Treasures Peak.

Everyone present knew that Lei Kunhai had a great-grandson, Lei Wanbao, who possessed superior spiritual roots, remarkable talent, and had already reached the Foundation Establishment stage. Lei Kunhai had long wanted his great-grandson to become a True Disciple, but various obstacles had prevented it.

Hearing Mo Changqing's words, Lei Kunhai frowned. "Sect Leader, I nominate my great-grandson, Lei Wanbao. He has reached the early Foundation Establishment stage, used a supreme-grade spiritual artifact to establish his foundation, and has the potential to form a Golden Core. Additionally, he has mastered the art of artifact forging."

Foundation Establishment.  
Supreme-grade spiritual artifact foundation.  
Mastery of artifact forging.

These three points were Lei Wanbao's qualifications for becoming a True Disciple. Moreover, Lei Kunhai had already investigated the other disciples in the sect—none matched his great-grandson's credentials. As far as he was concerned, his great-grandson's ascension to True Disciple was as certain as picking up a snail with three fingers—utterly assured.

"I also wish to nominate a disciple," Zhuge Wan suddenly interjected, her voice calm and unhurried.

"Oh? Another candidate?" The expressions of those present shifted at her words.

Everyone knew of Zhuge Wan's close relationship with the Sect Leader. It was highly likely that she had already discussed her nomination with Mo Changqing beforehand. With this in mind, the others couldn't help but glance at Lei Kunhai with pity.

Old Lei…  
Was he about to fail again?

And why "again"? Because he had failed the last time too!

"Who does Peak Master Zhuge wish to nominate?" Lei Kunhai asked, unable to remain seated any longer.

"Zhang Yan." Zhuge Wan's reply was firm and decisive.

"Zhang Yan?" The name left everyone momentarily stunned.

"Which Zhang Yan? I don't recall hearing of him."

Lei Kunhai's voice turned icy. "You mean that new disciple you just took in?"

"Indeed, my newly accepted disciple." A faint smile appeared on Zhuge Wan's face as she mentioned Zhang Yan.

"Him? That kid?" The others finally connected the dots. They had all met Zhang Yan and knew his name, but none had considered him a candidate—after all, he was far too young. They had assumed it was a case of mistaken identity, never imagining that Zhuge Wan would nominate her newest disciple.

"If I recall correctly, that disciple is still at the Qi Refining stage, isn't he? Has he reached Foundation Establishment?" Lei Kunhai's voice grew heavy with concern.

"No, he's only at the fifth layer of Qi Refining," Zhuge Wan replied matter-of-factly.

"Fifth-layer Qi Refining, and you're nominating him for True Disciple?!" Lei Kunhai, known for his fiery temper, nearly exploded in anger.

"Correct. Although Zhang Yan only has inferior spiritual roots and his cultivation is still low, his comprehension is extraordinary. His progress in mastering spells is unparalleled. I believe he is worthy of the title of True Disciple." Zhuge Wan remained unperturbed by Lei Kunhai's outburst, speaking in the same composed tone.

"Extraordinary comprehension? Unparalleled progress in spells? Don't tell me he's already perfected a spell at such a young age?" Lei Kunhai sneered through gritted teeth.

"Precisely. Elder Lei is indeed knowledgeable—you guessed correctly that my disciple has perfected a spell." Zhuge Wan's expression brightened, as if delighted that Lei Kunhai had figured it out.

"You—!" Lei Kunhai's anger flared at her reaction, but then he thought of his great-grandson.

His great-grandson was exceptional in every way—except for his aptitude in spell mastery. Before reaching Foundation Establishment, he had only managed to bring one spell to the Great Completion stage. With effort, he could perfect one spell, but perfecting a single spell before Foundation Establishment offered minimal benefits. As a result, Lei Kunhai had no choice but to seek a supreme-grade spiritual artifact tailored to his great-grandson's needs to aid his path to the Dao.

Now, seeing that Zhuge Wan's disciple had perfected a spell at such a young age, Lei Kunhai couldn't help but feel envious. Still, for his great-grandson's sake, he pressed on. "Even if he's perfected one spell, my great-grandson is no slouch either. He established his foundation with a supreme-grade spiritual artifact and has mastered artifact forging."

But as he finished speaking, he noticed an enigmatic smile playing on Zhuge Wan's lips. She then said softly, "Who said it was just one spell?"

"Not one? Then… two?" Lei Kunhai's expression darkened. If Zhang Yan had perfected two spells at such a young age, his talent might even surpass Mo Changqing's.

"Not two. Nor three. Four spells. My disciple, at the fifth layer of Qi Refining and only seventeen years old, has perfected four spells!" Zhuge Wan's voice carried a rare note of pride, her usually stern face alight with excitement.

A disciple's achievements were the greatest reward for a teacher. And Zhang Yan wasn't just achieving—he was setting records. Not just Qingheng Sect's records, but the records of the entire Zhou Kingdom. How could Zhuge Wan not be proud of such a disciple?

"What?!"  
"Four perfected spells?!"  
"Is this real?!"

Apart from Mo Changqing, everyone present was stunned. And after the shock came exhilaration—their Qingheng Sect had produced a prodigy! Truly, the heavens favored Qingheng!
