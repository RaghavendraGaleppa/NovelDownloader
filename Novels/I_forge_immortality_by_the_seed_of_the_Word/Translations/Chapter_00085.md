# Chapter 84 - Forging Eternal Life Through Dao Seeds

In the cultivation chamber.

Zhang Jing sat with his eyes closed, his aura growing increasingly oppressive and terrifying.

At a certain moment—

It was as if he had broken through a boundary.

Drip! Drip!

The sound of falling water echoed continuously.

Simultaneously.

A terrifying aura erupted from his body, instantly filling the vast cave abode.

The drifting mist-like spiritual energy suddenly converged into flowing rivers as if pulled by some powerful force, surging toward the cultivation chamber.

The rapid movement of spiritual energy stirred the air, creating fierce winds within the cave.

Zhang Jing unconsciously opened his mouth.

In that instant, vast amounts of spiritual energy poured into him like rivers returning to the sea, all swallowed into his abdomen.

Within his dantian.

The once extremely dense spiritual mist had completely disappeared, replaced by a pool of dark liquid at the bottom, emitting a terrifying, spine-chilling fluctuation.

Splash—splash—

The now completely liquefied spiritual energy flowed gently, nourishing his entire body and triggering another transformation in Zhang Jing's already extraordinary physique.

Strength, power, vitality, and even his sensitivity to spiritual energy were all improving dramatically!

Moreover, his spiritual sense also began to expand.

Its coverage increased rapidly.

Ten zhang, twenty zhang, thirty zhang...

Only when it reached fifty zhang did the growth of his spiritual sense gradually slow.

Splash—splash!

The phantom images of two spiritual rivers suddenly appeared, visibly growing longer, wider, and more turbulent!

After a brief internal assessment.

Zhang Jing couldn't help but show a look of astonishment.

The capacity of the Five Techniques Spiritual River had skyrocketed, now able to accommodate a terrifying ninety-nine spells.

It had truly become a torrent of spells!

Meanwhile, the Five Treasures Spiritual River could now hold twenty-four magical artifacts.

Of course, capacity was one thing.

Zhang Jing had no immediate plans to fill it to the brim.

Based on his estimates, with his current spiritual power, controlling the Five Treasures Spiritual River loaded with twelve high-grade artifacts was the optimal state.

This would ensure maximum power while maintaining manageable consumption, allowing the Five Treasures Spiritual River to become a truly regular combat method.

Still, it was necessary to prepare enough artifacts.

Better safe than sorry, after all.

He might not use them all, but it was essential to have them available.

At this moment.

In the spirit beast chamber.

Deer Thirty-Eight lay on the ground, its fur standing on end.

It stared fearfully in the direction of the cultivation chamber.

But the next moment, as if realizing something, the fear in its eyes gradually dissipated, replaced by unparalleled excitement.

That's right! Why be afraid?

Master was its backer.

The stronger he became, the safer it would be.

Having come to this realization.

Deer Thirty-Eight exhaled two streams of white air through its nostrils and then peacefully fell asleep.

An unknown amount of time passed.

The overwhelming aura that had enveloped the cave abode had completely vanished.

Zhang Jing was carefully examining the changes brought by his breakthrough.

Only through personal experience.

Did he truly understand the vast difference between the late Qi Refining stage and the mid Qi Refining stage.

It was a qualitative leap.

In terms of pure combat power.

The same strand of spiritual power, the same spell, when wielded by a late Qi Refining cultivator, was worlds apart from what a mid-stage cultivator could achieve.

This wasn't just due to the transformation in spiritual power intensity.

But also the differences in spiritual sense, spell comprehension, and even the ability to communicate with the surrounding spiritual energy!

Thinking this.

Zhang Jing suddenly realized just how monstrous the Five Treasures Spiritual River truly was.

Just then.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, are you free now? Please come out for a moment."

A refined voice gently sounded in his ear.

A visitor?

The voice sounded somewhat familiar.

Zhang Jing slowly rose and went to greet them.

Soon.

In the reception chamber of the cave abode.

Zhang Jing served a cup of spiritual tea before sitting opposite Senior Brother Qiu, studying him intently.

A hint of confusion colored his expression.

Senior Brother Qiu's sudden visit had completely taken him by surprise.

After taking a sip of tea.

Qiu Xiuming, noticing Zhang Jing's puzzled look, let out a hearty laugh.

"My abrupt visit must have disturbed you. Please forgive me."

"You're too kind, Senior Brother. It should have been me visiting you first," Zhang Jing replied politely.

"To be honest, Junior Brother, I came here to confirm something with you."

Qiu Xiuming gently set down his teacup, his expression turning serious.

"Please speak freely, Senior Brother. I'll answer truthfully."

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened.

"Haha, no need to be nervous. I just wanted to ask—have you successfully condensed a Source Rune?"

As he spoke, he stared intently into Zhang Jing's eyes.

The question startled Zhang Jing.

How did Senior Brother Qiu know about his Source Rune? Could it be because of the talismans he had sold?

His mind raced.

Other than that, he couldn't think of any other way the other party could have confirmed his possession of a Source Rune.

Wait—Source Rune?!

Zhang Jing suddenly realized.

From the way Senior Brother Qiu phrased it, it seemed other cultivators could also condense Source Runes?

And they must be extremely important.

Otherwise, why would someone of Senior Brother Qiu's status in the inner court make a personal visit?

After a moment of thought.

He met Senior Brother Qiu's gaze frankly and asked with a smile, "Senior Brother, are you referring to this?"

As he spoke.

The recently condensed Li Star Talisman Source Rune slowly appeared in his palm, its spiritual light flickering and causing ripples in the surrounding spiritual energy.

The air around them shimmered with waves.

Opposite him.

Looking at the familiar Source Rune in Zhang Jing's hand.

Qiu Xiuming's pupils contracted slightly, a flash of surprise in his eyes.

A mid-grade Source Rune?!

Shouldn't the Source Rune he condensed be the low-grade Star Guidance Talisman? Why had it suddenly become the Li Star Talisman Source Rune?

A moment later.

Qiu Xiuming shifted his gaze from the Source Rune to Zhang Jing.

The facts were now clear.

Not only had this junior brother condensed a low-grade Source Rune, but he had also managed to condense a mid-grade one.

His talent in talisman arts far exceeded initial expectations.

"Junior Brother, your talent in talismans is extraordinary," Qiu Xiuming said earnestly. "Join our Thousand Techniques Pavilion. With your aptitude, there's a high chance you could forge a top-tier Array-Talisman Dao Foundation in the future!"

"Senior Brother, may I ask what an Array-Talisman Dao Foundation is?"

Zhang Jing asked, puzzled.

Just from the name, he could tell this "Array-Talisman Dao Foundation" seemed different from the Dao Foundation Senior Brother Li had mentioned.

Hearing this.

Qiu Xiuming paused thoughtfully, organizing his words to explain to his junior brother.

Soon.

"Have you heard of Dao Foundations before?"

He looked at Zhang Jing with profound eyes.

Given this junior brother's talent, learning about the Foundation Establishment realm earlier wouldn't hurt.

"I've heard a little, but not much. Please enlighten me, Senior Brother."

Zhang Jing replied respectfully.

"Foundation Establishment—'building the foundation'—refers to forging one's Dao Foundation, hence the name of the realm. A Dao Foundation is profoundly mysterious. Some call it the seed of the Great Dao, others say it's the foundation of immortality. There are many interpretations."

Qiu Xiuming paused, then asked with a smile:

"The Dao Foundation you heard about before—was it related to Dao Rhymes, correct?"

Zhang Jing nodded.

"That's called a True Law Dao Foundation. True Law Dao Foundations are built from various Dao Rhymes, representing the most orthodox path. Depending on the Dao Rhymes, they reflect different principles of heaven and earth, allowing cultivators to observe and comprehend the world through them."

"But True Law Dao Foundations aren't the only path to immortality."

"The Array-Talisman Dao Foundation I mentioned earlier is another. Talismanic arts are essentially a branch of array formations, also interpreting the principles of heaven and earth. Array-Talisman Dao Foundations don't rely on Dao Rhymes but are built from various talismanic principles—Source Runes—ultimately forming a foundation of innate arrays. At that stage, a single thought can manifest countless formations. The cultivator becomes the array, and the array becomes the cultivator, wielding boundless power."

"This, too, is a path to immortality!"

"For us talismanic cultivators, the number and strength of the Source Runes we master determine the quality of the Array-Talisman Dao Foundation we can forge."

"You might not know this, but the current chief disciple of our Thousand Techniques Pavilion, Senior Brother You, forged a top-tier Azure-Gold Array-Talisman Dao Foundation. His strength is terrifyingly formidable—he's destined to ascend to the Upper Realm!"

"With your talent, Junior Brother, if you join the Thousand Techniques Pavilion and choose the Array-Talisman path, you could very well become the second Senior Brother You!"

Qiu Xiuming's eyes burned with enthusiasm as he looked at Zhang Jing.

At this moment.

"The Upper Realm?"

Zhang Jing's heart stirred.

This was the second time he'd heard this term.

The first had been in Senior Brother Li's introduction to the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven.

But compared to the Upper Realm, what interested Zhang Jing more now was the "Azure-Gold Dao Foundation" mentioned by Senior Brother Qiu—this likely referred to the quality of the Dao Foundation.

He hadn't forgotten what Senior Brother Li had told him before.

Due to differences in forged Dao Foundations, the gap between Foundation Establishment cultivators could be enormous.

Senior Brother Qiu's words echoed this sentiment.

Thinking this.

"Senior Brother, how are Dao Foundation qualities classified?"

Zhang Jing looked at his senior brother across from him.

"Dao Foundations are divided into five grades: White, Crimson, Azure, Gold, and Violet. White is the lowest—those who forge White Dao Foundations can't reach the Golden Core Divine Ability realm without extraordinary opportunities to transform their foundations. Violet is the rarest, known as the Immortal Foundation."

"But Violet Immortal Foundations are one in countless millions, reserved only for those with heaven-defying talent, comprehension, and fortune."

Qiu Xiuming explained patiently.

"Senior Brother, I've heard of the term 'superior Dao Foundation' before. Could you—"

"Haha, Junior Brother, 'superior Dao Foundation' refers to the Azure grade. For True Law cultivators, forging an Azure Dao Foundation requires fully comprehending several or even over a dozen related Dao Rhymes to have a chance. It's said the chief disciple of the Spirit Dao Pavilion forged an Azure Dao Foundation with eleven Dao Rhymes."

"Just think—mastering a single high-grade cultivation method and comprehending its Dao Rhyme is already extremely difficult, let alone over a dozen?"

"Of course, there is a 'shortcut.'"

"All high-grade legacies originate from the various Dao Intents within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven. If a cultivator can directly comprehend a trace of Dao Intent, forging a superior Dao Foundation becomes trivial. But the requirements for comprehension and opportunity... well."

Noticing Zhang Jing's hesitation.

Qiu Xiuming pressed on:

"With your talent, Junior Brother, the Array-Talisman path suits you far better. The Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven also contains nine immortal-grade Source Rune imprints encompassing myriad principles. If you can comprehend and condense even one, you'll undoubtedly forge an Azure Array-Talisman Dao Foundation. Comprehend three, and a Gold Dao Foundation will be within reach!"

As for more—Qiu Xiuming didn't even mention it.

That required not just talent, but destiny and fortune.

There had been precedents of comprehending six immortal-grade Source Runes, but those were from the distant past.

After a long silence.

"Senior Brother, let me think it over," Zhang Jing said slowly.

"Very well. I'll visit again another day."

Qiu Xiuming drained his teacup and stood to leave with a smile.

His purpose for coming had been achieved.

Junior Brother Zhang Jing had indeed condensed Source Runes—more than one, including a mid-grade.

It was time to report back to Senior Brother Yang Bai.

Zhang Jing's reaction was also within expectations.

Upon entering, Qiu Xiuming had noticed his cultivation had reached the seventh level of Qi Refining, and he'd faintly sensed traces of Dao Rhymes.

Clearly, his junior brother practiced a high-grade cultivation method.

This meant.

Zhang Jing wasn't just extraordinarily talented in talismans—his aptitude in the True Law path was equally exceptional.

That's why Qiu Xiuming had emphasized the difficulty of forging a superior True Law Dao Foundation.

But his words weren't lies.

While the Array-Talisman path demanded more innate talent.

The True Law path was universally acknowledged among inner court disciples as far more challenging.

After seeing Senior Brother Qiu off at the cave entrance.

Only when the other's figure had completely disappeared.

Did Zhang Jing slowly return to his cultivation chamber, where he began processing the wealth of information about Dao Foundations and the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven.

White, Crimson, Azure, Gold, Violet—the five grades of Dao Foundations.

The True Law path, the Array-Talisman path...

The various Dao Intents in the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven, and the nine immortal-grade Source Runes.

Gradually.

Zhang Jing reached his decision.

While the Array-Talisman Dao Foundation was tempting.

He knew his ability to quickly condense Source Runes relied entirely on the Nine Evolutions Spirit Star Talisman's skill trait—Runic Source Generation.

Choosing the Array-Talisman path would limit his potential.

The True Law path clearly aligned better with the mysterious jade talisman.

As for Senior Brother Qiu's claim that forging a superior foundation required over a dozen Dao Rhymes—was that really an issue for someone with the jade talisman?

With skill proficiency progression.

Given enough time, not just a dozen Dao Rhymes—he could master hundreds.

Moreover—

Zhang Jing thought of the Dao Intents within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven.

While Senior Brother Qiu hadn't elaborated, Zhang Jing could easily guess.

Comprehending a trace of Dao Intent allowed forging an Azure Dao Foundation. What about a complete Dao Intent? That likely corresponded to a Gold Dao Foundation.

With the jade talisman's assistance.

This wasn't an impossible goal.

If he remembered correctly.

The chief disciple of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, Senior Brother You—destined for the Upper Realm—had only forged an Azure-Gold Dao Foundation.

Well.

Zhang Jing realized he might be getting ahead of himself, using "only" to describe an Azure-Gold Dao Foundation.

Having clarified his path.

His expression returned to calm.

Whether it was the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven or forging a Dao Foundation—those were matters for the future.

For now.

Reaching the tenth level of Qi Refining was his priority. Without that, everything else was meaningless.

A monstrously powerful demon core appeared in his hand.

He was about to feed it to the Five Treasures Spiritual River.

But then, his hand froze.

Zhang Jing suddenly remembered—hadn't Senior Brother Li told him to visit immediately after breaking through to the seventh level of Qi Refining?

From the other's serious tone.

It hadn't seemed like just a matter of providing higher-grade pills.

Exhaling softly.

Zhang Jing stored the ninth-level demon core, and the Five Treasures Spiritual River faded away.

Then he stood and walked out.
