# Chapter 29: Third-Grade Spiritual Vein, Windmoon Lake

High above, white clouds drifted as a wide flying carpet cut through the sky, the sound of rushing wind all around. On the carpet stood five figures: the Qi Family's Grand Elder, along with Qi Chuan, Qi Chan'er, and two other Qi family youths about to begin their cultivation journey at the Windmoon Sect.

Qi Chuan sat cross-legged in meditation, his face bearing traces of travel fatigue. The strong winds buffeting the flying carpet would have flayed the skin of an ordinary mortal at this speed, but as cultivators with protective spiritual energy, they suffered no real harm—though it wasn't exactly comfortable either. 

With quiet resignation, Qi Chuan endured the discomfort. While this flying carpet was far more comfortable than the iron flying sword he'd ridden before, it still had its limitations.

[You diligently cultivated, completing a major cycle of the Evergreen Art. Triggering 5x critical effect—your spiritual energy has slightly increased.]

As he completed another major cycle and his energy returned to his dantian, Qi Chuan opened his eyes to see these words appear before him—words invisible to everyone else, including the Grand Elder. Watching the characters fade, Qi Chuan smiled slightly. Having cultivated for quite some time, he decided to take a break and turned his gaze forward to observe the landscape below.

The scenery of the cultivation world, untouched by the industrial pollution of his past life, remained pristine in its natural state. Yet even within this primal beauty, different regions held distinct characteristics.

Near human settlements—villages and cities—the surrounding mountains and grasslands appeared barren and desolate. Towering vegetation was scarce, with most trees having been felled for firewood or other uses. He even spotted villagers gathering dry grass from distant areas.

In contrast, the untouched wilderness far from human habitation exuded an ancient, untamed aura—true deep mountains and old forests where traces of demonic beasts could occasionally be seen. Some areas appeared dangerous enough to give even cultivators pause.

Along their journey, Qi Chuan had also glimpsed peculiar sights—ancient mountain ranges dotted with palace-like structures housing human activity, not unlike the Red Maple Valley. These were likely territories of other cultivation families similar to the Qi Clan.

All these lands—including Red Maple Valley and everything he'd seen along the way—presumably fell within the Windmoon Sect's domain.

Gazing at the scenery below, a thoughtful expression crossed Qi Chuan's face. At that moment, he sensed someone's gaze from his left. Turning, his eyes met those of the red-robed girl—Qi Chan'er had also paused her cultivation to look his way.

This wasn't their first exchanged glance during the journey. Qi Chuan responded with a faint smile before looking away, giving it no further thought. 

Qi Chan'er, however, withdrew her gaze with slightly puffed cheeks, her fists clenched secretly within her red sleeves. She silently vowed to herself: After entering the outer sect, she would cultivate diligently, advance to the inner sect, and surpass Qi Chuan.

She refused to believe herself inferior to anyone. Qi Chuan's current advantage of being in the inner sect was merely temporary—just as she had once held advantages of background and early access to cultivation. If he could overtake her despite those advantages four years ago, why couldn't she now return the favor?

Moreover, they both stood at the fourth level of Qi Refining now—equal in cultivation, separated only by their sect divisions. And her superior fourth-grade spiritual root remained her constant advantage.

The other two Qi youths who had secured outer sect positions paid little attention to Qi Chuan and Qi Chan'er. Still excited and expectant, they marveled at the scenery, knowing they couldn't compare to those two. Their hopes lay in using sect resources to advance their cultivation, perhaps reaching late-stage Qi Refining someday and returning home to become family elders—that would mark their greatest success. Foundation Building or even Qi Refining perfection remained beyond their aspirations.

Having withdrawn his gaze, Qi Chuan immersed himself in the fantastical landscapes of this immortal world, enjoying this rare moment of relaxation between cultivation sessions. As for Qi Chan'er's occasional glances, he paid them no mind—he had no regrets. Given the opportunity, who wouldn't strive for an inner sect position at the Windmoon Sect?

As the flying carpet soared onward, the scenery gradually transformed until something entirely different came into view.

Before them stretched an ancient mountain range of unimaginable scale—dwarfing not only Red Maple Valley but all the cultivation family territories Qi Chuan had seen along the way.

"Is this the spiritual vein occupied by the Windmoon Sect? I wonder what grade it is?" Qi Chuan mused, recalling that Red Maple Valley sat on a first-grade upper-tier spiritual vein. Would this be second-grade, or even third?

As they drew closer, the mountains revealed an unexpected feature. 

"This is Windmoon Lake, the heart of the Windmoon Sect," declared the Grand Elder, standing at the carpet's front.

"Windmoon Lake?"

The youths' eyes widened as they beheld the enormous lake nestled within the mountain ring, its surface shrouded in mist that partially obscured their view. The surrounding mountains formed a natural circular barrier that had initially hidden the lake from sight.

Now closer, they could see numerous islands of varying sizes dotting the misty waters. At the lake's center where the mist grew thickest loomed two enormous silhouettes—colossal shapes that inspired awe and even a touch of fear.

"Are those... two giant mountains?" Qi Chuan wondered, realizing these central peaks must stand several times taller than the surrounding range.

"Do you see?" The Grand Elder gestured toward the lake. "The outer mountains house the inner and outer sects—your future cultivation grounds. Their spiritual veins surpass even Red Maple Valley's, offering tremendous benefits."

"The islands host residences for sect elders and core disciples. And at the center..." He pointed to the twin peaks. "Rumors suggest the spiritual veins there may reach third-grade—the most concentrated spiritual energy in Windmoon Lake."

"These two mountains are renowned throughout the region—Wind Spirit Mountain and Moon Shadow Mountain, from which our sect derives its name."

"Legends say the sect's Golden Core stage Supreme Elder, the Mystic Sword True Person, resides within Moon Shadow Mountain's cavern abode."
