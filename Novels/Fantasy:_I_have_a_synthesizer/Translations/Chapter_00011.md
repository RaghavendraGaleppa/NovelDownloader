# Chapter 11: My Name is Su Yu!

At the Martial Artist Association.
Liu Kuang sat in his office, looking at the information on his computer screen.
A smile he couldn't hide spread across his face.
"Ten years! This time, thanks to that kid, we've finally attracted an envoy. I wonder how many people in Hengcheng will catch the envoy's eye this time!"
Liu Kuang took a deep breath. Even as the Vice President of the Hengcheng Martial Artist Association, he still felt inadequate in the face of the approaching dignitary.
"That kid truly is a lucky star!"
Liu Kuang's smile deepened. If Su Yu could gain the envoy's favor, his own status would rise considerably.
In an instant, Su Yu's importance in Liu Kuang's mind was elevated infinitely.

And just as Liu Kuang was thinking this, in the main hall of the Martial Artist Association.
Su Yu, dressed in a white shirt, quietly walked up to the reception counter.
The young lady behind the counter was surprised by Su Yu's youth but maintained a professional smile.
"Little brother, what kind of business would you like to handle?"
Su Yu's expression was indifferent as he calmly said,
"Please call Vice President Liu for me."
The young lady was stunned. Liu Kuang held a very high position in the Martial Artist Association; besides the elusive President, he was the most influential figure. Even the so-called corporate CEOs in Hengcheng needed an appointment to see Liu Kuang.

"Be more confident, drop the 'perhaps'. The youngest martial artists in Hengcheng are all in their twenties, aren't they? This kid looks like a high schooler; how could he possibly be a martial artist?"
Someone shook their head and retorted.
Su Yu stood at the counter, a slight frown on his brow.
Li Tianhe attacking him had already violated the Martial Artist Association's rules. However, given Li Tianhe's influence in Hengcheng, Su Yu knew that anyone below the Association's high-ranking officials would be unable to inflict any effective damage upon him.
Therefore, Su Yu had thought of Liu Kuang.
What Su Yu hadn't expected was that Liu Kuang would be so difficult to see.

"What are you all doing here? The Martial Artist Hall isn't a place for you to relax; everyone disperse!"
At that moment, a gruff voice boomed through the Martial Artist Association's hall.
Everyone's gaze turned towards the source of the voice.
They saw a square-faced middle-aged man striding in quickly, moving like the wind.
"Supervisor Zhou!"
"What brings Supervisor Zhou here?"
All the martial artists present were surprised.
A Supervisor was the most powerful person beneath the President.
They usually didn't make public appearances, so it was unexpected to see one today.
Supervisor Zhou's gaze swept over the crowd like a knife.

He had initially held a slight favorable impression of Su Yu, but after hearing what Su Yu said, that trace of goodwill instantly vanished.
No matter how big the matter was, there was no need to announce it in front of so many people.
However, Supervisor Zhou had a good temper and didn't take his irritation out on Su Yu.
Instead, he suddenly chuckled.
"It's been a long time since I've seen such an interesting young man at the Martial Artist Association. Today, I'd like to see what kind of matter it is that I can't resolve."
Supervisor Zhou continued with a smile,
"I'll help you notify Vice President Liu, but whether he's willing to come or not is not something I can decide!"
Su Yu nodded.
However, Su Yu was still unsure whether Liu Kuang would be willing to offend a behemoth like Li Tianhe in Hengcheng for his sake.
If it truly didn't work out, then he would just find Wu Ming.
