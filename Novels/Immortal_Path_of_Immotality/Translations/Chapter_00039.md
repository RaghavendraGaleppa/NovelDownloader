# Chapter 39: The Innate Vermilion Fruit  

Ten breaths later, all the red-clad men lay bruised and battered on the ground, leaving the onlookers utterly stunned.  

Only the young sect leader remained standing awkwardly in place. Fortunately, he hadn't made a move—otherwise, his fate would likely have been no better.  

Protector Jiang had only delivered a simple beating as a lesson. After all, it was broad daylight, and the docks were bustling with people. Starting a bloodbath here would have ruined his mood.  

Yes! It wasn't that he was kind-hearted—he just didn’t want his mood spoiled.  

The surrounding spectators, queuing up like melon-eating bystanders, were thoroughly entertained. Tales of chivalrous heroes righting wrongs and punishing evil were the most beloved topics of the day.  

Of course, they had no idea that the "hero" they admired was, in reality, the leader of an assassin organization. For now, they were inwardly thrilled, though they dared not show it on their faces, fearing retribution later.  

Lin Shan, however, stepped forward at this moment, curiosity once again getting the better of him. He asked the young leader of the Blade-Riding Sect, "Why are you all in such a hurry to get to Dongting Lake?"  

The young leader, Ren Wukuang ("Reckless as I Am"), shrank back slightly. Seeing that Lin Shan was with the black-clad expert blocking their path, he naturally didn’t dare refuse an answer.  

When under someone else’s roof, one must bow their head. Besides, this wasn’t some great secret.  

"Rumors say an Innate Vermilion Fruit has appeared in the eight-hundred-li waters of Dongting Lake! I was ordered by my father to lead a team there. This is our sect’s third group—my father and the elders are already ahead of us."  

Ren Wukuang subtly hinted that his father and the main force were waiting up ahead. It was best to leave some room for future encounters!  

But Lin Shan and Protector Jiang completely missed his point. Lin Shan was merely surprised upon hearing about the "Innate Vermilion Fruit," sensing that this item must be extraordinary to attract so many sects to compete for it.  

Protector Jiang, however, stepped forward in excitement, grabbing Ren Wukuang by the collar. "What did you say? The Innate Vermilion Fruit?"  

Ren Wukuang’s heart skipped a beat. He didn’t dare complain about the rough handling, only sweating profusely as he replied, "Yes... Ten days ago, the Three-Headed Dock of Jiangling publicly announced that an Innate Vermilion Fruit is about to ripen in Dongting Lake."  

"Wait!" Lin Shan couldn’t help but interject. "What exactly is an Innate Vermilion Fruit?"  

The question left both Ren Wukuang and Protector Jiang staring at him in disbelief.  

"???"  

Lin Shan didn’t understand what was so shocking. Was this thing really that famous?  

Protector Jiang, giving him the benefit of the doubt, suppressed his excitement and explained with a complicated expression, "There’s a legend in the martial world—a fruit exists that, when eaten, can turn an ordinary person into an Innate expert instantly!"  

"I think I’ve heard storytellers mention something like that when I was young." Lin Shan pondered, recalling a vague memory, then suddenly realized. "Don’t tell me this legend is true? And it’s about this Innate Vermilion Fruit?"  

"Exactly! This is that very miraculous innate spiritual treasure." Protector Jiang’s excitement was palpable, but seeing Lin Shan’s skepticism, he quickly elaborated.  

"Don’t doubt it! The world is vast, full of wonders. When I first entered the martial world, I didn’t believe it either. But didn’t I tell you the story of the Nightingale Headquarters’ Grand Elder?"  

Lin Shan naturally remembered and nodded. "The peerless genius who reached the Innate Realm at twenty."  

"Right!" Protector Jiang’s eyes burned with fervor. "But do you know how he achieved that feat at such a young age? It was because he stumbled upon an Innate Vermilion Fruit in the mountains and consumed it!"  

"What?"  

Lin Shan was genuinely shocked this time. Such a divine treasure actually existed?  

But then again, wasn’t it true that cultivators, upon reaching Qi Refinement, also gained abilities comparable to Innate experts? Since this world had cultivators, and its upper limits were still unknown, perhaps this wasn’t so unbelievable after all.  

Still, Protector Jiang was already an Innate expert. Why was he so worked up?  

At this moment, Protector Jiang released Ren Wukuang, standing there with surging emotions, muttering to himself, "If I consume the Innate Vermilion Fruit, not only will I instantly advance to mid-Innate, I might even reach peak Innate!"  

"And then, when I return to the capital, I’ll finally avenge my past humiliation!" As he spoke, Protector Jiang burst into laughter.  

The aura of an Innate expert was vast and profound. Protector Jiang’s laughter echoed across the entire riverside dock. The commoners nearby covered their ears in fear, while Ren Wukuang and his Blade-Riding Sect disciples trembled in terror.  

Holy heavens! We actually tried to attack an Innate expert earlier!  

Ignoring the Blade-Riding Sect’s terror, Protector Jiang’s laughter gradually turned into a sinister grin as he envisioned the glorious scene of crushing his nemesis.  

"The Innate Vermilion Fruit is mine! Anyone who dares to take it will die!"  

Just as he declared this, another voice spoke in perfect unison with him.  

"Indeed! Such a treasure is rightfully mine!"  

"Uh..."  

Protector Jiang stiffly turned his head toward the other speaker. His eyes met Lin Shan’s calm, unreadable gaze.  

……  

The two stared at each other for a long moment before Protector Jiang was the first to back down, forcing a smile.  

"If Brother Lin desires it, then I naturally won’t stand in your way."  

The faint resentment in his tone was palpable even to the Blade-Riding Sect members. Ren Wakuang shuddered inwardly—this black-clad man was an Innate expert, yet he seemed terrified of the white-robed youth?  

Lin Shan, meanwhile, turned to Ren Wakuang with a warm smile, shaking his hand amiably.  

"Young Sect Leader of the Blade-Riding Sect, would you mind giving us a ride to Dongting Lake?"  

Though his tone was gentle and friendly, the underlying authority was unmistakable. Ren Wakuang swallowed hard and forced a dry laugh.  

"Of course, it would be our honor."  

And so, under the resentful gazes of the commoners, the two no longer cared about cutting in line—urgent matters took precedence.  

They followed the Blade-Riding Sect members to the front of the dock, boarding a large vessel capable of accommodating dozens. At the boatman’s command, the crew rowed with all their might—after all, the recent influx of martial artists heading to Dongting Lake had been lining their pockets handsomely.  

……  

Onboard, Ren Wakuang recounted the full story of the Innate Vermilion Fruit’s discovery to Lin Shan and Protector Jiang.  

It turned out that the first to discover the fruit were the water bandits of Dongting Lake, the Twelve-Linked Docks.  

A decade ago, they had found a spiritual plant on a small island in the vast lake, bearing unripe vermilion fruits. Based on their analysis, the fruits would take about ten years to fully mature.  

The leader of the Twelve-Linked Docks was naturally overjoyed. He suppressed the news and secretly developed the island.  

But fate is unpredictable. Just last month, as the fruits neared ripeness, a minor leader within the Docks—resentful of being sidelined by his chief—leaked the information to the Three-Headed Dock of Jiangling.  

The Three-Headed Dock had clashed repeatedly with the Twelve-Linked Docks in recent years over territorial disputes.  

Realizing they couldn’t take on the Twelve-Linked Docks alone, they decided to make the news public, rallying all major sects and noble families across the nine regions of Jingxiang to converge on Dongting Lake.  

"We won’t take the fruit—but we’ll provide all the boats you need!"  

The entire Jingxiang region was thrown into an uproar, even alarming the local government!  

Over the past month, waves of martial artists had descended upon Dongting Lake, sparking countless battles. Though the Twelve-Linked Docks had numbers and the advantage of the lake’s terrain, they were steadily losing ground.  

According to scouts, their leader had retreated to the unnamed island, preparing for a last stand until the Innate Vermilion Fruit ripened.  

……  

Lin Shan listened thoughtfully, while Protector Jiang frowned. Dozens of major sects and noble families had joined the fray, half of them boasting Innate experts.  

One misstep, and they could easily meet their end here.  

As for Ren Wakuang and his men, they were inwardly panicking. Traveling with these two terrifying figures, they could only pray to reunite with their sect’s main force as soon as possible.  

……  

Thus, the ship sailed smoothly downstream, turning into a tributary of Dongting Lake at Huarong Path.
