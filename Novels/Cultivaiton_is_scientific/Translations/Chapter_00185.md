# Chapter 185: Gains  

Li Shiming didn't realize how rare an opportunity it was to single-handedly clean out the remains of a Golden Core cultivator's dwelling.  

Normally, almost no cultivator would explore a ruin alone, primarily because exploring ruins required teamwork to ensure safety.  

It was only because Six-Fingered Sound Demon had deliberately set it up to lure a lone cultivator.  

A genuine ruin wouldn’t be so easy to open, nor would it provide a method to unlock its formation.  

The first hurdle was breaking the formation. The formations of a Golden Core cultivator’s dwelling were not something a Foundation Establishment cultivator could easily dismantle.  

Next, one would have to face the self-defense mechanisms left behind by the Golden Core cultivator. Six-Fingered Sound Demon hadn’t left any such mechanisms in his dwelling, as he had other plans.  

Even if one managed to pass all these obstacles, the treasures that remained in a ruin after years of weathering were extremely limited.  

Cultivators weren’t the type to selflessly offer gifts. Often, ruins served as their tombs—it wasn’t as if they would willingly present treasures to those who dug up their graves.  

Thus, exploring ruins was a highly perilous task. Li Shiming’s exploration this time was, in fact, exceptionally dangerous.  

The second room was a study, where Li Shiming obtained a set of second-grade desk and chairs, along with a large number of jade slips. Among them, cultivation technique jade slips were few, with most being travelogues and knowledge-based records.  

The third room was a storeroom containing many spirit materials. Unfortunately, there were no third-grade materials—only second-grade ones.  

This storeroom didn’t resemble a Golden Core cultivator’s at all, leaving him deeply disappointed.  

The second-grade materials were disorderly and unsystematic, leading him to suspect they were merely spoils of war haphazardly tossed here.  

Moreover, some materials had been improperly stored, causing significant loss of spiritual essence and greatly diminishing their value.  

This was understandable. These materials had been stored here for at least several hundred years. Even with the protection of formations, they couldn’t prevent the slow dissipation of spiritual essence.  

Next, he went to the garden and collected the lotus flower along with its roots. He used a specialized jade box designed for storing spirit herbs, which could greatly preserve the lotus’s spiritual essence.  

The lotus had a calming and mind-stabilizing effect on cultivators. Planted in a dwelling, it could also freshen the air.  

This dwelling had remained unopened for centuries, yet its environment was still well-preserved—thanks in part to the second-grade lotus.  

Li Shiming thoroughly cleaned out the dwelling, taking everything that could be moved.  

The spirit vein here was only of upper-grade quality, inferior even to the one at the Wei Clan’s stronghold. It was unclear whether this was due to time or the vein’s original quality.  

Of course, the most likely explanation was that the spirit vein itself had deteriorated. Otherwise, Six-Fingered Sound Demon wouldn’t have chosen this place for his dwelling.  

He sealed the dwelling, adding another potential resting place to his list.  

Returning to the original room, he found that Jiang Chen had already cleaned most of it. The corpse of Six-Fingered Sound Demon and the black zither on the floor were now fully exposed.  

Li Shiming stepped forward and picked up the black zither. His spiritual sense swept over it. The original spiritual imprint had long since vanished, but as a life-bound magical treasure, traces of spiritual resonance remained.  

These traces were nearly impossible to erase. Unless one received Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s personal approval, no cultivator could unleash the zither’s full power—at best, only half.  

Life-bound magical treasures were deeply infused with their owner’s Golden Core essence, making them nearly inseparable.  

Of course, with enough perseverance, one might spend centuries slowly purging the essence to potentially enhance the treasure’s power.  

But few cultivators would do this. The time and effort required would be better spent focusing on other, more promising treasures.  

Storing the black zither away, Li Shiming scanned Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s fingers with his spiritual sense and retrieved the spatial ring.  

Upon closer inspection, he noticed that the man had six fingers on each hand—hence the name "Six-Fingered Sound Demon."  

With its owner deceased, the spatial ring offered no resistance to his spiritual sense.  

The ring’s internal space was vast—100 meters in length, width, and height, matching the size of his other spatial ring.  

But its contents were pitifully sparse. Li Shiming’s first focus was naturally on the jade slips.  

Two golden jade slips lay isolated in one corner—the only two in the entire space.  

Fortunately, their quality was the highest he had ever seen, making up for their lack in quantity.  

"Turtle Immortal Breathing Technique" was a life-extending art. Its sole purpose was to allow cultivators to live longer in a dormant state, even surpassing the limits of their natural lifespan.  

This technique offered no combat benefits and held little appeal for ordinary cultivators.  

The dormant state meant abstaining from food, drink, and other cultivation methods—only practicing the "Turtle Immortal Breathing Technique" to sustain life.  

Cultivating this technique wouldn’t enhance one’s strength. The only thing that increased during dormancy was lifespan.  

Li Shiming surmised that Six-Fingered Sound Demon had likely relied on this technique to survive.  

The second golden jade slip didn’t disappoint. "Heavenly Sound Secret Manual" was Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s legacy.  

For now, Li Shiming could only read the Foundation Establishment section. The manual detailed how to cultivate Heavenly Sound spiritual power and use it to perform the "Sound of Heaven’s Theft" secret technique, along with over a dozen musical scores with varying effects.  

After reviewing the Foundation Establishment section, Li Shiming was certain that the "Heavenly Sound Secret Manual" wasn’t a demonic cultivation technique but an orthodox Daoist sound-based cultivation method.  

Moreover, "Sound of Heaven’s Theft" wasn’t limited to the zither—it could be applied to any musical instrument to unleash its power.  

Of course, the manual included Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s insights on using the zither. If one employed the zither to execute "Sound of Heaven’s Theft," there was no need for trial and error—one could simply follow the established methods.  

Li Shiming frowned slightly. His innate talent wasn’t exceptional—his triple spiritual roots made his cultivation speed inherently slow.  

If he added sound-based cultivation to his regimen, his progress would slow even further, severely hindering his development.  

Initially, he had assumed Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s legacy was merely a sound-wave technique. Who would have guessed it was an entire sound-based cultivation method?  

For now, he wouldn’t study the "Heavenly Sound Secret Manual." As for Li Yuanba, the sword cultivator—adding sound cultivation to his repertoire would only take him further from the path of a pure sword cultivator.  

Setting the two golden jade slips aside, he turned his attention to a pile of jade boxes.  

Based on his experience, any spiritual items stored in jade boxes were extremely valuable.  

And if they were precious to Six-Fingered Sound Demon, their worth to Li Shiming was beyond imagination.  

Then came an awkward realization—as he opened the boxes one by one, he sensed the rich spiritual energy but couldn’t identify any of the contents.  

From the energy’s quality, he deduced they were all third-grade spirit herbs. The boxes themselves were spirit tools, capable of preserving the herbs for extended periods.  

Even without recognizing the herbs, he felt a surge of wealth. The possessions of a late-stage Golden Core cultivator were truly abundant.  

Beside the jade boxes were two spirit ores—third-grade, unprocessed materials for crafting magical treasures.  

Li Shiming still couldn’t identify them, realizing how much knowledge he lacked.  

This was despite having accessed all the Wei Clan’s library collections. Of course, after studying the jade slips from Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s study, his knowledge would expand significantly.  

The final item was a golden coffin. He couldn’t open it, and his spiritual sense instinctively recoiled in fear upon approaching it, as if something terrifying was sealed inside.  

These were all of Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s possessions. Li Shiming noted the absence of pills or spirit stones—not even a single low-grade spirit stone.  

In truth, over the years, Six-Fingered Sound Demon had exhausted all his pills and spirit stones. Had the third-grade herbs not required processing, he would have consumed them as well.  

Storing the spatial ring in his machine room space, Li Shiming scanned Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s corpse with his spiritual sense.  

He soon shook his head. The corpse’s muscles had atrophied to near nonexistence, the entire body withered and emaciated. Even the skeletal joints had stiffened from prolonged inactivity.  

This corpse held no value—not even for refining into a corpse puppet.  

Corpse puppets required a certain baseline quality in the original body for transformation. With Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s muscles almost gone, there was nothing to work with.  

"Fellow Daoist, the corpse is yours. It might still be of some use," Li Shiming said to Li Yuanba.  

"Fellow Daoist, I’ll take it then!" Li Yuanba replied with a smile, storing the corpse in his storage bag.  

Li Yuanba planned to join the Nether Sect, and since Six-Fingered Sound Demon had once been hunted by them, the corpse might prove useful at a critical moment.  

After resealing the dwelling, Li Shiming reflected on the formation knowledge he’d gained, particularly regarding spatial isolation, which had opened new horizons for him.  

Leaving the dwelling, the two used sword flight to follow the map toward the Nether Sect’s headquarters.  

The journey remained chaotic. Throughout the Ten Thousand Mountains, cultivators fought over resources and interests, the entire region seemingly shrouded in an aura of violence.  

"Fellow Daoist, we part ways here. Take this and be careful," Li Shiming said, retrieving the Nether Token from his machine room space and handing it over.  

They were a thousand miles from the Nether Sect, but ahead lay the sect’s formation-covered territory. Transferring the token from his machine room space there could cause complications.  

Besides, the area ahead was relatively safe. Within ten thousand miles of the Nether Sect’s stronghold, conflicts between cultivators dwindled significantly.  

Here, cultivators seemed to coexist peacefully, a stark contrast to the brutality elsewhere.  

"Fellow Daoist, you take care as well," Li Yuanba replied, accepting the token.  

Li Shiming transformed into a streak of sword light and departed. Li Yuanba watched him disappear before turning to leave.  

"Hey, you up ahead—stop that kid!" a voice suddenly shouted from behind.  

Turning, Li Yuanba saw a bloodied youth missing an arm sprinting toward him, pursued by over a dozen cultivators.  

The one-armed youth eyed Li Yuanba warily but, seeing no hostile intent, focused on the ground ahead. Spotting a stone stele, his face lit up with excitement.  

The youth accelerated, stopping just before the stele and turning to smirk at his pursuers.  

Li Yuanba, uninterested in intervening, walked past the stele. Glancing at it, he saw the words "Nether Sect" carved into the stone.  

"Damn it, he made it to the Nether Sect! Wait—that guy has a Nether Token too!" one of the pursuers exclaimed, clutching a compass.  

Despite the short distance between them and their targets, none dared to attack.  

No one in the Ten Thousand Mountains dared to violate the Nether Sect’s rules.  

The youth overheard and shot Li Yuanba a venomous glare. Seeing the latter’s copper mask and pristine condition, untouched by hardship, envy and resentment flared in his eyes.  

He had paid dearly for his token—his family dead, his own life force drained in his desperate escape.  

Yet Li Yuanba had arrived unscathed, as if on a leisurely stroll. The injustice burned.  

Unaware of the youth’s thoughts, Li Yuanba studied the stele. Seeing the pursuers halt, he understood that crossing it meant safety.  

Relieved, he summoned his Swiftwind Golden Light Sword and soared into the distance.  

The youth, fearing Li Yuanba might steal his opportunity, cast a final hate-filled glance at his pursuers—his eyes brimming with venomous malice—before sprinting toward the Nether Sect’s mountain gate.  

Some of the pursuers shuddered, others clenched their weapons to suppress the urge to silence the youth permanently, while a few sneered dismissively.  

The Nether Sect, despite being a demonic cultivation sect, wasn’t the gloomy stronghold one might imagine.  

Its gate comprised twelve verdant peaks shrouded in drifting clouds, with flocks of birds weaving through the scenery.  

Li Yuanba stood before the gate, facing a massive stele inscribed with two blood-red characters: "Halt." The strokes seemed to writhe with countless screaming figures, a grim warning of the consequences for disobedience.  

Holding his Nether Token, he waited for the sect’s response.  

The youth soon arrived, his face deathly pale from pushing his injuries to catch up. His gaze at Li Yuanba burned with even deeper hatred.
