# Chapter 105: Perfection of the Innate Realm

At Qingfu Temple, Fushong supervised the disciples as they practiced the Martial Scripture. The entire training ground radiated with scorching yang energy, dispersing the winter chill through their vigorous movements.

Reclining on a rattan chair while cracking beans, Fushong wasn't being lazy—he was using the disciples' released vital energy to temper his divine sense and cultivate the Formless Heart Method.

When Fushan emerged from the alchemy room and saw the temple's thriving atmosphere, he recalled his youth when Qingfu Temple had over three hundred disciples, yet none matched the current vitality.

"The Martial Scripture compiled by Qingzhi is excellent for foundational training, though somewhat lacking in depth," Fushong remarked upon seeing Fushan.

Fushan replied, "For foundational training, simplicity is best—it minimizes errors. Take Zhou Zhuang's blacksmith Hu, for instance. He had innate talent for cultivation but ruined his path by reckless experimentation."

Fushong disagreed, "That merely proves his body was suited for qi refinement. True cultivation depends on both physical aptitude and Dao-heart. Physical talent alone isn't enough. The Martial Scripture's flaw lies here—it can't distinguish true Dao talents. The world teems with martial artists, but even with Qingzhi's guidance, how many can reach the Innate Realm? Those who can forge new paths are exceedingly rare."

Counting on his fingers, Fushong concluded there were exactly five, himself included, exuding an air of self-importance.

Fushan chuckled. "Our junior brother's approach is correct. Let disciples master the basics first and endure solitude before advancing. Even those with modest talent will eventually comprehend. Despite eliminating powerful demons and monsters, as Qingzhi said, spiritual energy is reviving. These threats will keep emerging endlessly. Only by spreading martial arts and teaching people to harness demonic energy for cultivation can balance be achieved, preventing the erosion of humanity's cultivation environment."

"Demons and monsters are mere fools, no match for our wisdom," Fushong scoffed.

Fushan grew serious. "You're gravely mistaken. Once demons awaken their intelligence, their physical prowess surpasses ours. Even at the Innate Realm, how do we compare to their innate gifts? If they reach the legendary transformation stage, their wisdom may even exceed ours. And the most terrifying aren't just demons, but..."

He paused. "Cultivators who fuse with demons—possessing human intellect and demonic gifts, yet twisted by demonic nature into cruel, bloodthirsty beings who view all life as sustenance."

Fushong pondered. "Don't long-term cultivators also come to see mortals as insignificant?"

Fushan shook his head. "At least we maintain order. Those beings act on impulse without restraint. Imagine if Qingzhi fell to demonic paths—who could stop him?"

This hidden worry surfaced only before Fushong.

Fushong shrugged. "We'll do our best. If we can't stop him, so be it."

He accepted fate's whims—life was but rain upon the earth, transient and experiential. Fushan's newfound worldly concerns seemed unnecessary.

"You've grown carefree where I cannot," Fushan observed.

Fushong grinned. "I care only for martial prowess."

"Then you'll never surpass me," Fushan retorted, floating slightly with a flick of his horsetail whisk.

"You can fly now?" Fushong gaped.

"Merely hovering. True flight like Qingzhi's remains beyond me," Fushan stroked his beard proudly.

Fushong muttered, "Don't be fooled by Qingzhi's show—I bet he can't fly a hundred li without rest."

Just then, Lin Wanyue arrived hurriedly.

"What brings you here in such haste?" Fushan's calming voice steadied her.

"A letter from Taihe Mountain."

After reading it, Fushan's expression darkened. Fushong read it next, having already seen its contents.

"The Great Zhou's founding emperor still lives?" Fushan sighed heavily.

Fushong clenched his fists. "With the dynasty gone, what's that old fool planning? Let's go to Taihe Mountain—I don't want to miss Zhang Jingxiu's embarrassment."

Fushan shook his head. "No need. He's already coming."

Soon, a disheveled Zhang Jingxiu and Prince Qinghe arrived.

"Daoist Fushan, where's Zhou Zhenren? Disaster looms," Prince Qinghe said grimly.

Fushong exclaimed, "Old Zhang, you're fast! We just got your letter."

Zhang Jingxiu replied, "Demonic methods are unpredictable. That man is no longer the Great Zhou's founder but a demonic incarnation. Where's Zhou?"

Meanwhile, beneath the great mulberry tree, Zhou Qing focused on his Health Preservation Panel.

Techniques: Indestructible Diamond Body (Proficient), Cloud-Parting Palm (Proficient), Wind God's Leg (Proficient), Frost Fist (Beginner).

Frost Fist stemmed from his comprehension of this realm's heavenly laws—an irreversible trend where frost would blanket the world as demons revived. Yet this purge would refine humanity while breeding stronger demons.

In meditation, Zhou Qing envisioned an indescribable being whose death birthed protective rules for this realm. But within its body slept demonic seeds awaiting awakening.

Spiritual energy ebbed and flowed like tides, explaining cycles of revival and extinction.

What being could transform into protective rules after death? Even such power wasn't eternal, revealing the arduous path ahead.

Zhou Qing's newly formed divine sense—normally achievable only after Qi Refinement's Foundation Establishment stage—illuminated his mind, triggering changes in his Health Preservation Panel.

As he meditated, his four supreme techniques began merging. Qi, body, and spirit gradually unified toward Innate Perfection—the legendary tenth layer of Qi Refinement, where no bottleneck existed for Foundation Establishment, requiring only a hundred days of refinement.

At twenty-five, Zhou Qing became only the second in centuries to reach this stage after Jingyang Zhenren.

"Jingyang likely achieved this much later, given his recorded deeds spanned two centuries," Zhou Qing mused. True dragons belonged in oceans, not confined to mortal realms.

"Death comes for all, reducing even peerless geniuses to dust," Zhou Qing reflected without pride.

His self-created Sacred Heart Art's first layer embodied Innate Perfection, with Foundation Establishment as its natural progression. Future layers required his own innovations.

True cultivation meant forging one's own path. Sacred Heart Art originated from his belief in an "immortality-granting" technique. Other skills' names reflected his whims—Cloud-Parting Palm, Wind God's Leg—simple and memorable.

Cultivation turned fiction into reality.

The white-haired youth—Great Zhou's founder—remarked, "Powerful mountain demons grow rare. But three demon essences suffice to make me invincible."

"Conquering the world is simple—just repeat history," he declared confidently to gathered royals. "March forth! I'll appoint you all as kings."

His makeshift army advanced toward Jiangzhou, where victories would temper them into elites.

Zhou Qing had intended to lure out snakes by exploring Jingyang's cave. Now targets revealed themselves prematurely.

Politically unskilled, Zhou Qing relied on overwhelming personal power. Moreover, the founder—ancestor to Yuan Mingyue—having reached the Innate Realm and fused with demons, might yield benefits to accelerate her advancement, enhancing her already astonishing array mastery that seemed almost preternatural.

With his Sacred Heart Art complete and Innate Perfection achieved, Zhou Qing stood ready. The stage was set for convergence.
