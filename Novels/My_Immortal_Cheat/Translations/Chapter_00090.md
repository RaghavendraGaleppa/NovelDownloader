# Chapter 90: Zhang Yi?

Zhou Tian didn't dwell too much on the Lich King issue, casually brushing off Mu Su's questions. Mu Su, wanting to maintain her aloof demeanor, didn't press him on what was truly going on with this 'upright' knight, the Lich King.

After chatting with Mu Su a bit more, Zhou Tian learned that the items covered by the white cloth in the carriage were actually treasures that their town had painstakingly gathered. As for why they weren't stored in spatial equipment, Mu Su explained that they didn't possess such advanced items, which greatly disappointed Zhou Tian. He had thought the covered items were something so precious they couldn't even fit into spatial gear, the kind of things that were true ultimate treasures.

As for why these rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures were needed, Mu Su didn't know; she only knew that was the message from Celer City, instructing them to bring some along. Zhou Tian also heard an interesting piece of news from Mu Su: in a few days, Celer City would publicly try the people they had captured. Regarding the actions of these people, Zhou Tian could only comment that they were truly courting death. Did they really believe that with some so-called 'holy decree,' these people could overturn their fate and sing like liberated serfs?

After these discussions, the two fell silent. Zhou Tian quietly waited for his resurrection count to refresh, while slowly formulating his new ideas in his mind.

Time passed, minute by minute, second by second. The day-night cycle in the God-Forsaken Land was quite peculiar; it wasn't a gradual transition. The moment the sun set and the moon rose, day instantly turned into night. This abrupt change made Zhou Tian very uncomfortable.

The moon was as bright and clear as a jade disk, casting down silvery moonlight. As the moon rose, Zhou Tian also arrived at Celer City, following Mu Su. Though Celer City sounded ordinary, it was, without a doubt, a holy city of the Divine Holy Church. While a bit desolate, it was much better off than those religions that didn't even have a gathering place.

Built entirely of light-white stone bricks, it stood about a hundred zhang tall, qualifying it as a medium-sized city. Two silver-armored soldiers stood guard at the city gate, with people entering and exiting occasionally, giving it little resemblance to a holy city of a great religion.

As they approached the city gate, the guards stepped forward to block their path. Two long spears crossed, emitting a milky-white glow, a faint aura of power radiating outwards. Their voices were cold and sharp: "Who goes there?"

While they wouldn't stop one or two individuals entering or exiting, Mu Su's convoy, with its many people, still required inspection.

"Escorting the Saintess!"

Mu Su took out a white token and tossed it over. It was carved with a flower-like pattern. The guard took the token, a smile lighting up his eyes. He nodded, handed the token back, and moved aside, clearing the path. He even glanced at Zhou Tian, who was sitting behind Mu Su, but said nothing more.

Once inside the city, the roads were quite wide, lined with white trees. People came and went, most dressed in white robes adorned with a flower-like pattern, likely their religious emblem. It was a scene of peace and harmony.

Not long after entering the city, Mu Su stopped her warhorse and said to Zhou Tian, "Alright, we've arrived at Celer City. You can get down now, right?"

"Alrighty then." Zhou Tian jumped off the horse and patted Mu Su's thigh, wincing as his hand hurt from the armor plating. He gasped, saying, "Captain Mu Su, many thanks. Please also extend my gratitude to that 'kind-hearted' Saintess. Goodbye!"

With that, he turned to leave, but after two steps, he returned. Meeting Mu Su's puzzled gaze, Zhou Tian chuckled awkwardly and said, "Um, could you lend me some money?"

He had just remembered he didn't have a single valuable item on him; even the clothes on his back were acquired through a brush with death. He couldn't very well sleep on the streets, could he?

Mu Su gave him a speechless look, then pulled out a small purple pouch from her bosom. It was embroidered with a small white flower, looking unlike a man's accessory, likely a gift from someone else. From the pouch, she took out five white crystal coins and handed them to him.

Zhou Tian took them. He didn't know how the value of these coins was calculated and didn't bother to ask. He tucked them into his pocket, then turned and walked into the crowd.

Mu Su watched his retreating back for a moment, then urged her warhorse towards the designated location. It wasn't her first time in Celer City; she knew its layout.

Meanwhile, Zhou Tian found a place similar to an inn. The purchasing power of the white crystal coins Mu Su had given him was quite high; one coin could pay for a night or a day's stay. This further solidified Zhou Tian's inner thoughts as he settled into his temporary abode.

Zhou Tian wandered around Celer City. After a full circuit, he discovered that there were virtually no entertainment venues; most places were dedicated to prayer. The faces of the people here showed no signs of numbness; instead, they were full of vitality. Especially when emerging from a place of prayer, the energy radiating from them seemed capable of piercing the heavens.

Turning a corner, a statue appeared before him. It was about ten zhang tall and entirely white. What struck Zhou Tian as familiar were the six pairs of wings on its back, identical to those of the 'bird-man' he had seen that day.

Beneath the statue stood a group of people in white robes—the most common sight Zhou Tian had encountered in Celer City. They were murmuring in agitation. Zhou Tian only heard clearly as he drew closer.

"People who blaspheme the Lord should be executed!"

"Yes, they should have their livers pecked out by eagles under the scorching sun!"

Indignant voices filled his ears; he could clearly sense the rage of those people. Zhou Tian squeezed through the crowd and saw a line of text written on a platform beneath the statue:

"These blasphemers of the Lord will be judged at sunrise, and the Holy Envoy of Judgment shall bear witness to it all!"

Below it, a row of portraits of bald-headed individuals was posted.

'Garbage, still using painting techniques,' Zhou Tian secretly expressed his disdain, recalling the Heavenly Qin's ultra-long-distance projection technology.

"Alas!" Zhou Tian looked through the rows, and at the end of the third row, he saw a familiar face.

"Isn't that Zhang Yi? It really looks like him."

Zhou Tian leaned in. Although it was a portrait, it had been drawn by someone with profound cultivation, so it wasn't distorted. After a careful examination, Zhou Tian confirmed it was indeed that guy, Zhang Yi. He carefully re-examined the fifteen portraits across the three rows but found no other acquaintances, only Zhang Yi.

"How could Zhang Yi have been captured?" Zhou Tian was very perplexed. Logically speaking, Zhang Yi should never have been abandoned.

Before Zhou Tian could ponder further, an uncle next to him clapped him on the shoulder. "Young man, you also think these people deserve to die, don't you?"

"Uh..." Zhou Tian was startled. Seeing the uncle's face turning red and the others also looking displeased, he quickly said, "Yes, absolutely! These bastards dared to blaspheme the Lord; they deserve to be executed by fire!"

Only then did the uncle's expression soften. Zhou Tian quickly extricated himself from the crowd. Gosh, fanatical religious followers were truly terrifying.

Zhang Yi definitely had to be rescued, but he needed to plan carefully. After all, he didn't even know where Zhang Yi was being held. He opened his Undying System for a quick look. There were about three *shichen* left until his next resurrection count refresh. He needed to find a place to use them up quickly, otherwise, today's refreshes would be wasted.
