# Chapter 86: A Page of the Dao Contract Leads to the Grotto-Heaven, Five Human Immortals Hunt the Debt Collector!

At the summit of Guyue Peak in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, the head of the Enforcement Hall arrived in haste.

"Elder, the plan has failed."

"..."

"Elder Yan has suffered severe injuries, and Li Zhengjing has disappeared without a trace—clearly taken away," the Enforcement Hall leader reported in a low voice. "Upon investigation, Elder Yan's formations covered a radius of a hundred miles, yet no one broke through. Now, Li Zhengjing has vanished into thin air..."

"The Star-Shifting Grand Formation," the Elder of Guyue Peak said calmly. "Only this formation could have transported them away in an instant."

"But Elder Yan activated his fire formation, burning away all traces in the vicinity. Even if the Star-Shifting Grand Formation was used, any remnants have been incinerated, leaving no clues to follow," the Enforcement Hall leader explained.

"I recall that Li Zhengjing carried quite a few items with him, didn't he?" The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official emerged from the shadows and spoke.

"All of his belongings have vanished without a trace. There's no way to track the Debt Collector's lair through them," the Enforcement Hall leader murmured. "Not even the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber shows any signs."

"So..." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official turned his head slightly toward the Elder of Guyue Peak and said coolly, "After all this elaborate effort to lure out the Debt Collector, waiting to follow the trail to his lair... Now, the fruit has been plucked, the vine severed, and all traces lost. The entire plan has collapsed in failure?"

"It seems our earlier arrangements were all within his grasp," the Enforcement Hall leader whispered.

"Failed?" The Elder of Guyue Peak clasped his hands behind his back, his expression unchanged. "This is just the beginning."

Within the Dragonfall Grotto-Heaven.

Grotto-heavens and blessed lands are nearly self-contained realms, hidden within the world yet separate from it. They possess their own flora, fauna, and abundant spiritual energy.

Once, the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official speculated that the underworld beyond the stone bridge beneath Fengdu Mountain might be a vast grotto-heaven, where practitioners cultivated with yin energy, communed with wandering spirits, and bred formidable beings—leading mortals to mistake it for part of ancient mythology.

But the truth remained unclear.

Li Zhengjing had changed into a new set of clothes, empty-handed, his expression complicated.

Elder Yan's flames had burned away even his garments, while the Debt Collector had taken everything else—the phoenix wood box, the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber—and discarded them casually.

"The fire formation of the Formation Pavilion's master wasn't originally this fierce. I merely stoked the flames to erase all traces of you," the old man said indifferently from where he sat ahead. "With all external objects removed and no anomalies within your body, the Elder of Guyue Peak can no longer locate you."

"..."

Li Zhengjing's gaze sharpened as he studied the man before him.

The content on the golden page shifted.

**Name:** Jing Xiao.  
**Age:** None.  
**Cultivation:** None.  
**Identity:** None.  
**Fortune:** None.  

**Hint:** The target's cultivation far exceeds your own! Display failed!  
Insufficient spiritual energy! Please replenish with 236 spirit stones!  

"Last time, as Elder Gu, he only required a hundred spirit stones. Now, despite my higher cultivation, he demands over two hundred. Has he grown even stronger?"

"But the Elder of Guyue Peak explicitly stated that this would be the Debt Collector's weakest moment in his entire life."

"Has the Elder... miscalculated?"

Li Zhengjing's thoughts churned as he regarded the man who had once made him feel the warmth of a senior's care—Elder Jing Xiao of the Public Affairs Hall.

"Your recent grand display was undoubtedly orchestrated by the Elder of Guyue Peak to elevate your reputation," Elder Jing Xiao said with a faint smile. "But whether he had a hand in it matters little to me. As long as you prove exceptional, I will come to claim you. Yet now, you've left me somewhat disappointed..."

Li Zhengjing sat cross-legged and asked calmly, "Why?"

Elder Jing Xiao sighed. "You defeated Lu Huaiyuan, and I thought you might be ripe for the picking. But now I see you haven't even opened a hundred acupoints in the Qi Refinement realm."

He sounded regretful. "Though your combat prowess is impressive, your cultivation foundation is lacking, and your body can't bear the burden. Yet, considering you've reached this level in less than a year, you truly are a peerless genius. Breaking through all 365 acupoints to achieve Perfected Qi Circulation shouldn't take long. I've already prepared everything for you..."

Li Zhengjing replied evenly, "What if I refuse to continue cultivating?"

Elder Jing Xiao chuckled. "After all my years, do you think I'll let you choose?"

Li Zhengjing sighed in resignation. "I've heard the Debt Collector has existed for millennia, scheming across the world with boundless methods. Even the legendary underworld bends to his will."

Elder Jing Xiao's eyes narrowed slightly, but he didn't respond.

Li Zhengjing pressed on, "One thing puzzles me—did you recently become Elder Jing Xiao, or have you always been him?"

The old man before him remained silent, his gaze growing colder.

Li Zhengjing spread his hands. "Everything on me, even these clothes, was given by you. I just want to die with clarity. Didn't you say you're nearing death yourself? Grant me this small comfort."

His voice lowered. "I know there's no escaping this calamity. If you let me understand, I'll comply."

"Seventeen years ago, I was the Supreme Elder of Wuding Mountain—Lin Zhenyuan," Elder Jing Xiao declared, standing tall. "The former Sect Master of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect fought me at Fengdu Mountain. He perished on the spot, while I barely survived, though my body was ruined. So, I poured my Human Immortal cultivation into this body—Jing Xiao—shattered his soul, and took possession. It's been seventeen years now..."

"I've researched the Supreme Elder of Wuding Mountain. If he were alive, he'd be over 800 years old," Li Zhengjing said, studying the Debt Collector. "Eight hundred years ago, who were you?"

The Debt Collector's expression remained indifferent. "Why should a dying man care about distant history? Today, I am Jing Xiao. The one who kills you is Jing Xiao..."

He stepped forward, smoothing Li Zhengjing's hair with a gentle hand. "I know you're fishing for answers, but your fate is sealed. What use is knowing more?"

With that, he retrieved a pair of boots, knelt, and helped Li Zhengjing put them on. "I've answered what concerns you. The past is irrelevant. Now, focus on cultivating. Cherish this body. Understood?"

Li Zhengjing looked down at him, his left arm's divine ability stirring.

If he unleashed a Blazing Sun Divine Sword straight into the Debt Collector's skull now, could he kill him instantly?

The golden page's fortune shifted abruptly:

**Attempting to assassinate the Debt Collector will provoke his wrath, leading to endless torment before being thrown into the Golden Pool of the back mountain, forced to cultivate to the peak of the Qi Refinement realm!**

"..."

Li Zhengjing sighed and suppressed his killing intent.

The Debt Collector stood, gripping Li Zhengjing's left arm for inspection. "The Evergreen Dao Body can manifest innate divine abilities? The records make no mention of this..."

*Crack!*

Li Zhengjing's left arm snapped, flesh torn, bone exposed, blood gushing.

The Debt Collector released him, watching as Li Zhengjing gritted his teeth in silence, pressing his broken arm back into place.

In moments, the blood clotted, flesh knitted, bones reconnected, and meridians regrew—visible to the naked eye.

"Had I possessed the Evergreen Sacred Body these past seventeen years, I wouldn't have abandoned my original form for Jing Xiao's," the Debt Collector mused.

He then lifted Li Zhengjing and carried him toward the cliffs at the back of the Dragonfall Grotto-Heaven.

From the cliff's edge, the view below resembled a volcano—thick, molten lava, but of a golden hue.

"This Golden Pool has gathered three centuries of this grotto-heaven's spiritual energy. Immerse yourself, and the energy will flood your body," the Debt Collector explained with a smile. "Only by refining it to reach the peak of Qi Refinement, achieving Perfected Circulation, can you withstand the influx..."

Li Zhengjing asked, "And if I don't refine it?"

The Debt Collector replied flatly, "An ordinary cultivator would explode from the spiritual energy overload."

Li Zhengjing eyed him but said nothing.

The Debt Collector continued, "I know you might prefer death to submission. But remember—your Evergreen Sacred Body won't let you die so easily. Your flesh will rupture, heal, rupture again, and repeat... an unending cycle of agony."

Before his words faded, he flung Li Zhengjing off the cliff.

*Boom!*

The thick golden lava barely splashed as Li Zhengjing sank into it.

The Debt Collector flicked a finger, casting a glowing barrier over the pool.

"Only at the peak of Qi Refinement can you break this seal. But given your combat prowess, only a Human Immortal can shatter it," the Debt Collector said with a chuckle. "Your talent surpasses even the young master of Kunlun. I believe you can break free. Of course, if you fail, you'll remain in torment until I return to release you..."

His tone carried a hint of concern as he added, "Take care of yourself."

Meanwhile, submerged in the golden lava, Li Zhengjing burned hotter than in Elder Yan's fiery formation.

Yet vast amounts of spiritual energy seeped into his body through every pore.

Unable to resist, he opened his mouth and drank deeply.

The golden lava entered him, instantly converted by the golden page into pure spiritual energy.

He channeled the *Tiger and Leopard Thunder Prison Technique* to transform it into visceral qi, then the *Feathered Transformation Dragon Celestial Art* to refine it into true qi, breaking through acupoints.

"This pool is a treasure trove! If I could absorb it all, wouldn't it be like devouring half a spirit stone mine?"

The thought thrilled him, yet unease lingered.

All his possessions had been discarded by the Debt Collector—including the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, which bore the Elder of Guyue Peak's mark.

Without these items, how would the Elder locate him here?

He had prepared for this, but grotto-heavens were self-contained realms. Would the plan still work?

Moreover, since the Debt Collector knew the Elder of Guyue Peak was scheming against him, he must already be on guard.

If the Elder lost this game of chess, Li Zhengjing might be safe for now—but as the most crucial piece, he was about to be devoured.

His thoughts raced, yet his cultivation never ceased. He had already broken through over a dozen acupoints.

If this battle ended in utter defeat, trapped in the Dragonfall Grotto-Heaven, he would be at the Debt Collector's mercy—with no chance of escape, doomed to a living hell.

But if his suspicions held, his cultivation now could mean survival later.

This golden lava pool was like an endless supply of spirit stones—a rare opportunity!

"At this rate, I'll break a hundred acupoints within half an hour and reach 365—Perfected Qi Circulation—by nightfall."

The thought filled him with mixed emotions.

Such rapid progress should bring joy.

But the faster he advanced, the sooner death would come.

*Boom!!!*

A deafening explosion echoed from outside!

Li Zhengjing's heart pounded. "They're here!"

He surged upward, his opened back acupoints releasing qi to propel him toward the pool's surface—only to be forced back down by the Debt Collector's barrier.

He managed to lift his head just enough to witness the grotto-heaven's upheaval—sky and earth inverted, winds howling, thunder roaring, flames raging!

"How did you find the Dragonfall Grotto-Heaven, Elder of Guyue Peak?" The Debt Collector's voice, calm as ever, echoed across the heavens. "I knew you schemed with Li Zhengjing as your pawn, but I discarded all his marked belongings and burned away the traces with formation flames. How did you track me here?"

"Didn't he mention the underworld to you?" The Elder of Guyue Peak's voice was steady. "He swore a Dao Oath, and the contract is in my hands! For years, I played along, biding my time for this moment—your fatal flaw!"

"What? Have you abandoned your final step—surpassing the current Sect Master to claim leadership?" The Debt Collector's tone turned icy. "The *Tiger and Leopard Thunder Prison Technique* is lost to the Feather Transformation Sect. Only I possess the complete method! To merge it with the *Feathered Transformation Dragon Celestial Art* and restore your sect's glory, you must still serve me!"

"Then witness my power today!" The Elder of Guyue Peak's voice boomed. "Seventeen years ago, the former Sect Master wounded you with the *Dragon-Tiger Supreme Fusion Art*! Now, weakened, you'll fall to the same technique!"

The sky trembled with dragon roars and tiger growls, storms gathering, lightning tearing through the clouds.

"When did you obtain the *Tiger and Leopard Thunder Prison Technique*?" For the first time, the Debt Collector's voice held tension. "Even with it, you couldn't have reconstructed the *Dragon-Tiger Supreme Fusion Art* so quickly! Did the former Sect Master leave it to you?"

A moment later, the Debt Collector's aura surged. "No matter! If I could kill your predecessor, why not the Elder of Guyue Peak? A mere technique won't change your fate!"

The heavens seemed to split as the two Human Immortals clashed—with the Debt Collector swiftly gaining the upper hand!

This was the legendary Debt Collector, after all—a being who dared to manipulate the world's mightiest forces as pawns!

Though the Elder of Guyue Peak had once slain three helmsmen of the Golden Ship of Salvation and defeated the Fengdu Deity, he was no match for the Debt Collector.

Only a being who towered above the mortal realm could treat its greatest powers as soil for his schemes, plucking the fruits he had sown from their grasp!

"You are stronger, but now that I know your limits, you are no longer unfathomable!" The Elder of Guyue Peak shouted, "Activate the formation!"

Blazing flames engulfed the entire Dragonfall Grotto-Heaven.

Li Zhengjing ducked back into the golden lava.

Outside, chaos reigned. The once-serene grotto-heaven of lush mountains and clear waters was reduced to ruins.

Elder Yan's voice rang out, "With me, the Formation Pavilion's master, joining the fray, how much weaker are we compared to the Debt Collector now?"

"Far weaker!"

Even facing two opponents, the Debt Collector dominated!

Li Zhengjing's mind reeled. "This is the Debt Collector at his weakest? How terrifying must he be at full strength?"

Then, a piercing cry echoed as flames painted the sky.

A divine bird, a hundred zhang long, its wings blotting out the heavens, soared into view.

"The White Phoenix?"

Li Zhengjing recognized it instantly—it resembled Bai Guabi before his "cosmetic surgery" by the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official. "That's Guabi's grandfather! Didn't he enter the Thunder Prison in the back mountains as punishment for Guabi's sake?"

Realization dawned. The Elder of Guyue Peak's plan had been in motion for a long time!

Even Bai Guabi's grandfather was part of it—entering the Thunder Prison under false pretenses, lying in wait to ambush the Debt Collector!

As he watched, the divine bird released an object from its beak, letting it fall.

Li Zhengjing's eyes widened—it was his phoenix wood box, wrapped in fiery energy, crashing through the Debt Collector's barrier!

Protected by Elder Bai Xiao's power, the box floated atop the golden lava, unharmed.

"Friend Zhengjing, open the box! There's help inside!" Yuan Zhengfeng's voice burst forth, excited. "No—two helpers, including me!"

Li Zhengjing's expression grew complex. "The Elder of Guyue Peak, the Formation Pavilion's master, Elder Bai Xiao, and the hidden Ghost Valley Spiritual Official—even combined, they can't guarantee victory against the Debt Collector?"

He wasted no time, swimming forward to open the box.

Inside lay a lifeless corpse.

When he saw its face, Li Zhengjing froze, his throat dry.

"Him?!" His mind raced, struggling to piece together the implications. One thought stood clear: "All my earlier deductions were wrong!"

"Revive him!" Yuan Zhengfeng urged. "The Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber is on the left inside the box. Next to it is a bronze mirror containing his lifetime's cultivation. Cut along the edge and help him return! Together, we'll slay the Debt Collector!"
