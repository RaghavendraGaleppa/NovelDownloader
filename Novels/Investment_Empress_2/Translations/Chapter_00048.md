# Chapter 48: This Kid Is Too Honest, The Ancient Bronze Heavenly Scripture Seal!

Qingyuan Sect, Scripture Pavilion.

This was an octagonal building, stacked layer upon layer, reaching a height of a hundred zhang.

Many disciples passed in and out.

As soon as Li Mo appeared at the entrance, he drew countless gazes.

"Is that the true disciple Li?"

"Senior Brother Li is so handsome, especially when he smiles. He’s so gentle, unlike the other true disciples who are so aloof."

"The one at his waist is the Chixiao Sword, right? He obtained a mystic weapon at such a young age; his swordsmanship must be excellent."

"Something happened at the Divine Blade Cave yesterday; the earth veins erupted ahead of schedule."

"Alas, the third layer and below of the Divine Blade Cave have been sealed by Elder Hanhe. I'm afraid it will be difficult for disciples to obtain mystic weapons in the future."

"Many elders don't even have mystic artifacts; it doesn't have much to do with us disciples anyway."

...

The whispering wasn't loud.

But Li Mo heard it all clearly.

"Elder Hanhe moved quite fast."

"The old man cares about his reputation, but he handles matters reliably."

While pondering this, Li Mo arrived at the counter on the first floor.

The inner gate deacon recognized him immediately and put on a smile.

"True Disciple Li, are you going to the fifth floor to claim the reward for the sect trial?"

"Exactly."

Li Mo nodded and handed over his waist token.

"Uh... True Disciple Li, the fifth floor only has mid-tier martial arts."

The inner gate deacon reminded him.

Suitable mid-tier martial arts are quite rare for inner gate disciples.

But a true disciple shouldn't lack such things, right?

Li Mo smiled without speaking.

The inner gate deacon suddenly remembered that although this True Disciple Li was a true disciple, his master was Elder Shang Wu...

That made it normal immediately.

"You can choose two mid-tier martial arts, please go ahead."

"Thank you."

Not long after, the other party completed the record.

Li Mo then turned and went upstairs.

On the second floor of the Scripture Pavilion, there were still many Qingyuan Sect disciples.

The lower three layers held non-tiered martial arts, as well as various biographies and miscellaneous books.

Li Mo didn't stop and walked up the stairs.

On the fourth floor, the number of people decreased significantly.

Here, it was the lower-tier martial arts, as well as various knowledge such as alchemy, forging, and raising exotic beasts.

The disciples reading here were mostly inner gate disciples.

Li Mo did take notice.

There were even books about chefs.

However, after picking one up and glancing at it, Little Li put it back with a twitch at the corner of his mouth.

"No wonder the food at the Qingyuan Sect's cafeteria isn't very good."

Li Mo said that it wasn't even a fraction as good as the cookbook he got from the investment return.

Fifth layer.

There were even fewer people here.

Only disciples who had completed sect tasks and accumulated certain contribution points could spend them to come up.

"Hammer techniques..."

Li Mo walked to the place where weapon techniques were stored.

"Quenching Hammer Technique... used for forging."

"Tiger Roar Hammer... suitable for long-handled great hammers? Not quite..."

Alright.

It seems that not only does Little Li himself not like hitting people with hammers.

The Scripture Pavilion is quite comprehensive, yet it can't find a few hammer techniques.

It makes sense.

In the martial world, you hear about Sword Gods, Blade Sects, and Spear Immortals.

When have you ever heard of someone whose title includes a hammer?

Hammer techniques are already niche enough.

The Pan Jie Meteor Hammer is a short-handled hammer, making it even more niche.

"Brother Li!"

At this moment, a familiar young voice came from not far away.

Turning around, he saw Murong Xiao waving at him from a distance.

"You too, here to pick martial arts?" Li Mo asked in surprise.

The Divine Weapon Peak is a big sect.

Could it be that a true disciple personally came to the Scripture Pavilion to find martial arts?

"Brother Li, you misunderstood."

"I didn't tell my master."

Murong Xiao gave a wry smile.

He explained a couple of things. After Li Mo activated his Destiny Divine Eye, he understood.

【Name: Murong Xiao.】
【Age: 16.】
【Physique: Roaring蛟 (Dragon) Body.】
【Realm: Seven Meridians of the Blood Qi Realm.】
【Destiny: Blue with a hint of Grey.】
【Evaluation: His father is human, his mother is a shape-shifting蛟. His nature is kind but heavily influenced by his bloodline. If he can combine the advantages of both, his future is limitless; if he combines the disadvantages, he will bring disaster.】
【Recent Encounter: Influenced by his bloodline, he has recently been plagued by distracting thoughts and constant nightmares, dreaming day after day of his hands being covered in blood. Thus, he wants to find a mental technique that can calm his mind and spirit.】

"My master still doesn't know that my half-demon bloodline comes from the Roaring蛟..." Murong Xiao sighed with a worried expression.

"So that's why you came to the Scripture Pavilion yourself?" Li Mo's expression was strange.

Murong Xiao nodded. "Yeah, if the old man asks, I don't want to lie to him, but I don't dare tell the truth either, so I just didn't tell him..."

Li Mo: "....."

Elder Hanhe is so easy to talk to. If you beat around the bush a bit, getting a mental technique would be as easy as pie. He might even throw you a high-tier mental technique directly.

This kid is too honest.

"You should be able to find a mental technique."

"But don't expect a mid-tier mental technique to suppress your bloodline," Li Mo shook his head.

"Then what should I do... Huh?" Murong Xiao looked troubled, truly not knowing what to do, when a booklet was suddenly stuffed into his hand.

"This is..."

"The Golden Bell Shield, a high-tier body-refining martial art."

"Ah?" Murong Xiao opened his mouth, completely confused, not knowing why Brother Li was giving him a body-refining martial art.

"To clear the mind and calm the spirit, must it necessarily be a mental technique?"

Li Mo looked at this unfortunate child helplessly:

"This high-tier martial art comes from the Buddhist sect, containing Buddhist principles. It is a method of cultivating both body and mind."

"If you practice the Golden Bell Shield well, why would you fear distracting thoughts?"

"Golden Bell Shield..." Murong Xiao's dim eyes lit up.

But soon, he became awkward again, pulling at his clothes hem as if he wanted to say something but hesitated...

"Don't worry about it."

Li Mo patted the Chixiao Sword at his waist. "I took a mystic weapon from the Divine Weapon Peak, which is much more precious than a high-tier martial art. Consider it a return for your gift."

Actually, it wasn't just the Chixiao Sword.

Whatever he gives out, the other party might profit a little, but he always profits much more.

"The Divine Weapon Peak is the Divine Weapon Peak; how can that be considered a return for your gift..."

"Brother Li, I've received another great favor from you."

Murong Xiao pursed his lips tightly, his gratitude beyond words.

Seeing him like this.

It seemed that if Li Mo made any request, as long as it wasn't giving birth, Murong Xiao wouldn't even frown.

"When you go down the mountain to execute sect tasks, you must notify me."

"Sect tasks..."

Including true disciples.

All Qingyuan Sect disciples must complete large or small sect tasks regularly.

This is mandatory.

After all, if the Qingyuan Sect just stood there doing nothing, no one would respect it as the head of the Ziyang Prefecture sects.

"I do have that intention recently."

"I'll be troubling you then."

Li Mo agreed.

The Murong family has considerable influence in Ziyang Prefecture, and they are one of the local powers. No matter what task he does, they can provide convenience.

"I'll go back now to contemplate the Golden Bell Shield!"

Murong Xiao finally showed a smile.

"Go ahead."

After he left.

The system timely sent a notification:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in Murong Xiao a high-tier martial art, helping him摆脱摆脱 the bloodline trouble.】
【Investment Feedback: Ancient Bronze Heavenly Scripture Seal.】
【Ancient Bronze Heavenly Scripture Seal】: "Stamp it on any martial art to allow it to be deduced and perfected, thereby raising the martial art's grade. It can raise a martial art up to the level of a supreme technique."

"Good stuff!"

A high-tier martial art becomes a supreme technique.

And he can even choose the type of supreme technique!

The feedback Murong Xiao brought him this time was somewhat beyond expectations!
