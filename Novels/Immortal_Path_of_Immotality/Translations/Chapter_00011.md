# Chapter 11: Counterattack and the Token

Lin Shan suddenly remembered that his enhanced innate technique, the "Evergreen Art," had a derived secret skill—Severing Fate Palm! 

The technique only required Evergreen Art's true qi and wasn't particularly difficult to master. He had learned it long ago but had never had the chance to test it. Now seemed like the perfect opportunity.

Amidst the chaotic three-way battle, fallen leaves swirled through the forest. Despite being ambushed by Old Pu and suffering a severe chest wound, the short, stout man relied on his abundant true qi and exquisite palm techniques to push both opponents into retreat.

Seizing the moment, Lin Shan maneuvered behind the stout man while exchanging a glance with Old Pu. The experienced elder immediately understood—though he didn't know what trick the young man had up his sleeve, he knew his role was to provide cover.

With a loud shout, "Take this!" Old Pu swung his broadsword with his right hand while his left hand, hidden behind his back, made a sudden motion.

Thinking the old fox was about to throw lime powder again, the stout man instinctively dodged and closed his eyes. Lin Shan seized the opening, slashing with his blade. Remarkably, the stout man countered by listening to the sound of the attack, deflecting the blade with a palm strike.

But Lin Shan had anticipated this. As the stout man parried, Lin Shan closed the distance, his left palm glowing with verdant light as he struck the man's right armpit.

"Bam!"

"Ah! You tricked me!" the stout man roared, opening his eyes to see Old Pu's left hand empty—no lime powder at all.

Meanwhile, excruciating pain radiated from his armpit. After a few more exchanges, he realized something was terribly wrong.

Five breaths later, his right arm began to grow numb.  
Ten breaths later, the entire limb started withering, shrinking by a full circle.  
Fifteen breaths later, he lost all sensation—his arm was now little more than skin and bones, resembling a withered bamboo pole.

"What kind of vicious palm technique is this?" The stout man's heart sank. With one arm crippled, his once-formidable defense quickly crumbled under the relentless assault of the two.

Old Pu, sharp-eyed as ever, noticed the change and focused his attacks on the weakened right arm. Under their combined assault, the stout man couldn't evade forever—his right arm was severed at the shoulder.

"Gah!" 

Knowing the battle was lost, the stout man turned to flee toward the valley, hoping to summon reinforcements. But Lin Shan and Old Pu gave chase, unwilling to let him escape.

Half a quarter-hour later, the stout man lay dead on the ground, his body riddled with wounds.

Exhausted, Lin Shan slumped against a tree, gulping water from the flask Old Pu tossed him. Fighting and killing a seasoned martial artist had drained him completely. 

At the same time, he marveled at the sheer power of Severing Fate Palm. Truly worthy of a secret technique derived from an innate art—brutally effective!

Old Pu, meanwhile, rummaged through the corpses with the enthusiasm of a treasure hunter. Lin Shan couldn't help but admire the old man's energy.

"Not bad! These two had a hundred taels of silver on them. We've hit the jackpot!" 

Old Pu didn't hoard the spoils. He bundled up the loot and tossed it to Lin Shan to inspect.

Money was always a good motivator—Lin Shan immediately perked up and began sorting through the haul. 

Aside from the silver, there were medicinal ointments, dried rations, and two hexagonal brown tokens.

"Too bad we didn't find that stout guy's palm technique manual," Lin Shan muttered, still awed by how the man had held his own despite his injuries.

Old Pu chuckled. "What, you think people carry their martial arts manuals when they go out to kill? That's not how it works."

Lin Shan picked up one of the tokens, its surface worn with age. Faintly visible was the inscription: "丙贰拾伍" (Bing Twenty-Five). The material was unidentifiable.

Then, something unexpected happened—his long-dormant enhancement panel suddenly activated.

**[Identity Token]**  
Ancient Aura: 1 point  
Absorb?  

Lin Shan nearly jumped in excitement, startling Old Pu.

"What's gotten into you?" 

Seeing the token in Lin Shan's hand, the old man sighed in relief. "Good thing we killed someone from this organization. At least there won't be any retaliation."

"You know what this is?" Lin Shan quickly composed himself, feigning curiosity. "Mind enlightening me?"

"It's a Nightingale Token," Old Pu explained. "Twenty years ago, I befriended an assassin who showed me his. Looks just like this, except for the number."

"The Nightingale is an assassin guild. I don't know much about their structure, but I do know one thing—if a member fails a mission and gets killed, the guild won't seek revenge."

He then added with a strange expression, "They also have a peculiar rule: they recognize the token, not the person."

"What does that mean?" Lin Shan asked, intrigued.

"It means if you hold this token, you're automatically a member. The previous owner is irrelevant—you inherit his place."

Old Pu advised, "I suggest you toss it. These tokens can sense each other at close range. The Nightingale is full of ruthless killers, and infighting is common. You're new to the jianghu—best not get involved."

Though fascinated, Lin Shan couldn't reveal his enhancement ability. Reluctantly, he resisted absorbing the ancient aura and picked up the second token instead.

This one was newer, with fewer scratches and a clearer inscription: "辛贰拾壹" (Xin Twenty-One). 

No ancient aura this time.

"Probably a newer token from recent recruitment," Lin Shan mused. 

Still, the Nightingale Tokens were a valuable lead. If he wanted more ancient aura, older artifacts were the key.

Old Pu's warnings fell on deaf ears. The mere possibility of uncovering more ancient aura was enough to keep him hooked.

After a long rest, no pursuers appeared.

"With the escort agency's losses—especially the death of Head Escort Wang, our only first-rate expert—it's time for this old man to retire," Old Pu mused, stroking his stubble.

*More like you've got enough silver to live comfortably now,* Lin Shan thought wryly.

They had split the spoils—fifty taels each. Since Lin Shan's palm strike had been decisive, Old Pu respected the unspoken rules of the jianghu and didn't pry into his techniques.

"What's your plan now? Coming back to Qinghe County with me?"

Lin Shan frowned, considering the fallout of the failed escort mission. The authorities would undoubtedly hold them accountable, but to what extent was unclear. The Lin family might shield them—or sacrifice them as scapegoats.

Even if they escaped punishment, the escort agency was crippled. The Lin family would likely reorganize, and Lin Shan would be dragged back into servitude.

After this brush with death, he realized something—staying in Qinghe County would lead nowhere. His talent was mediocre, and his only advantage was the enhancement panel. To make full use of it, he needed to hunt for ancient aura.

He had no family ties, and his disappearance would go unnoticed. 

"No, I think I'll travel to Zangke County."

Seeing Lin Shan pocket the tokens, Old Pu guessed his intentions but didn't press further. The jianghu was vast, and every young man dreamed of adventure. 

With that mysterious palm technique and his sharp wits, Lin Shan would do just fine.

"Then farewell. Maybe one day, I'll hear tales of your exploits!"

With a hearty laugh, Old Pu puffed on his pipe and vanished into the forest.

---

*That's the free spirit of the jianghu! Though at his age, can he still be called a "young hero"?* 

Lin Shan watched Old Pu disappear before turning the other way, his pack slung over his shoulder. It was time to explore the world beyond.

The sea was vast for the fish to leap; the sky was boundless for the birds to soar.
