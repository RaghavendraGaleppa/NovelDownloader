# Chapter 246: Swallowing the Armor

Pei Yan naturally knew what Xu Yunfan intended to do. The other party possessed a supreme treasure and certainly did not want others to know about it. That Ginseng Qi was simply astonishing...

He fell silent for a moment, calculating in his heart. Once they left, how could such a treasure be allowed to remain outside?

He nodded slightly.

"Brother Xu, please proceed as you wish."

After blindfolding Pei Yan, Xu Yunfan lightly tapped the Xuan Steel Mechanism Box with two fingers. Accompanied by several clicks of mechanical parts, a faint, unusual fragrance instantly assaulted the nostrils. Pei Yan felt his entire body's blood and qi become several times more active.

The instant the mechanism sprang open, two赤芒 (crimson lights) exploded within the depths of Xu Yunfan's pupils.

The dragon scale armor plates on his spine bristled layer by layer with a thunderous crack, the muscles of his right arm coiled like a python, and the unique Xuan Steel hue of the Xuan Steel Hundred-Refining Body spiraled upward from beneath his ribs.

"Crack!"

Seven layers of ring-shaped shockwaves exploded from Pei Yan's Adam's apple. The throat bone that should have shattered was instead firmly blocked by a hexagonal armor extended from his divine armor.

Xu Yunfan's five fingers hooked like claws onto the surface of the armor, the Red Python Mountain-Crushing Strength transforming into three thousand burning steel needles frantically stabbing inward.

"You, Xu Yunfan..."

Pei Yan's furious shout was laced with a sweet, metallic taste of blood. The spirit of the divine weapon's chest plate was stimulated and instantly revived, the patterns on the precious armor flaring up brightly.

Pei Yan, realizing the situation instantly, burst through the blindfold. Simultaneously, his right hand formed a sword with two fingers, and a wisp of sword qi bursting from his fingertips shaved off three inches of Xu Yunfan's front hair.

Xu Yunfan, who had tilted his head back slightly, showed no change in expression. His foot arches suddenly crushed the rock layer, the unique force-dissipating ripples of the Xuan Steel Hundred-Refining Body spreading from the soles of his feet.

The moment the rock surface within a thirty-foot radius exploded into dust, the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace had already pierced through the air from behind.

*Clang!*

The shockwave generated by the collision between the mace tip and the frost blade sent the lava from the geothermal pool surging thirty feet high.

Pei Yan used the momentum to retreat seven steps, his toes tapping the surface of the lava to create two ripples. His eyes churned with fury and shock. "Why?!"

"Brother Pei is joking. Ever since you taught me the Void Clearing Sword Washing Technique..."

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan held the Lin (Forest) Seal with his hands crossed before his chest. The emotions in his eyes rapidly dissipated, replaced by tranquility.

The heavy mace vibrating incessantly in his hand also quickly calmed down, carrying a low humming sound with his movements.

He spun around to evade three strands of sword qi attacking from the ground, closing the distance in an instant. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace swung out nine crescent-shaped arcs in mid-air.

The moment the python patterns on the mace body lit up one after another, his shoulder blades produced a rumble like the shifting of the earth's crust, and the twelve-fold layered Red Python Strength erupted like a volcano.

*Li Ti* (Leaving the Body), Xu Yunfan's feet suddenly caused the lava pool to boil!

Dark purple geothermal fire turned into nine chains entangling Pei Yan, but they solidified into glass pillars the moment they touched the precious armor.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with a cold light. Just as he had expected, this divine weapon and precious armor were mutually exclusive with the attribute of the geothermal fire. It was no wonder that when Pei Yan was burned by the geothermal fire earlier, the armor on his body burst forth with clear frost.

"Break!"

Pei Yan roared as he shattered the frost, his chest armor shining brightly and bursting with chilling寒气, almost instantly freezing the lava at the edge of the geothermal pool into charred black rock.

Xu Yunfan clearly saw his Tian Tu acupoint swell like a ball, the residual Ginseng Qi in his San Jiao meridians frantically transforming into sword qi.

*Chi!*

A spiral sword qi mixed with cyan and gold colors pierced through the air. Wherever it passed, the lava was frozen into dark green toxic crystals.

Xu Yunfan did not dodge or evade. The hexagonal lattice of the dragon scale armor's heart-protecting mirror suddenly flipped outward, directly taking this desperate sword qi head-on. At the same instant, the muscles of his right arm strangely shrank three inches.

*Now is the time!*

The Sky Cicada Linked Body Technique he had once practiced, combined with the Sky Cicada Strength and the unique force-dissipating ability of the Xuan Steel Hundred-Refining Body, allowed Xu Yunfan to slide like a fish into the blind spot of the sword qi.

The trailing flame of the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace suddenly surged, the pommel's armor-piercing锥 precisely striking a major acupoint on the root of Pei Yan's thigh.

Pei Yan felt his entire half-body go numb, instantly losing strength, and even the divine weapon and precious armor he wore could no longer be maintained.

Before the black blood vomited by Pei Yan could hit the ground, Xu Yunfan's left hand had already clamped onto his jaw.

"You!"

Looking at Xu Yunfan's face devoid of sorrow or joy, his eyes showing not a trace of fluctuation, not even a hint of killing intent, Pei Yan's pupils constricted. The cyan-gold sword qi churned madly in his throat.

However, Xu Yunfan opened his mouth first. A sword strength completely beyond Pei Yan's expectations spewed forth from his throat.

*Chi!*

The moment white mist rose, Pei Yan's entire body suddenly lit up with thousands of golden threads.

Xu Yunfan instantly let go, his feet moving rapidly as he retreated ten zhang, the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace blocking horizontally in front of his chest.

Pei Yan's skin was visibly turning jade-like, the sword qi in his San Jiao meridians breaking out of his body uncontrollably.

"Using the body as a sheath... I wonder what kind of sword qi you have accumulated?"

Xu Yunfan's expression was flat. He understood in his heart that Pei Yan had already begun to fight for his life; this was likely his final move.

*Boom!*

The lava pool exploded violently. Seven Northern Dipper sword shadows burst forth from Pei Yan's shattered physical shell.

In this desperate situation where ice crystals and lava intertwined, this Sword Pavilion Walker used the ultimate move of the Sword Pavilion's secret martial arts, "Weapon Dissolution Transformation Dao," condensing his lifelong sword qi into a deadly trap.

The Lin Seal was pushed to its limit at this moment. With his true spirit seated in the Sea of Consciousness, it shone even brighter, suppressing all negative emotions.

The world slowed down abruptly in his eyes. The trajectories of the seven strands of sword qi were clearly distinguishable: Tian Shu locks the soul, Tian Xuan seals the meridians, Tian Ji breaks the bones, Tian Quan shatters the armor, Yu衡 (Yuheng) breaks the marrow, Kai Yang burns the blood, and Yao Guang destroys the spirit!

The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper.

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace suddenly vibrated on its own.

The nine python patterns oozed magma-like blood light, with wisps of divine weapon energy spiraling around it.

Xu Yunfan, inspired by an epiphany, poured his entire body's strength into this weapon that had been silent for a hundred years, swinging the ultimate move of the Nine Profound亢 Dragon Mace against the Northern Dipper Sword Array.

Wherever the mace tip passed, the air distorted, and the geothermal lava was sucked into a vacuum vortex.

The seven strands of sword qi, as if falling into a quagmire, crumbled inch by inch within the python blood flame.

"Ah!!"

Pei Yan's eyes were about to split. Watching his unleashed sword qi be easily shattered by Xu Yunfan, the sword soul formed by the Weapon Dissolution let out an unwilling shriek, yet it dissipated upon touching the mace tip.

If only his Green Bamboo Sword were still here...

Unwilling, he poured everything he had, channeling all his strength into the precious armor on his body, hoping to block this strike.

However, the dragon scale armor plates on Xu Yunfan's body began to flutter incessantly at this moment, spewing out streams of scorching heat currents resembling lava.

A strange fluctuation suddenly erupted from the dragon scale armor, instantly spreading to the precious armor worn by Pei Yan, actually suppressing all supernatural phenomena completely.

Pei Yan's mind trembled violently, crying out involuntarily.

"Eight-rank Divine Weapon?!"

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, carrying a magma-like wave of energy, slammed down violently.

The Northern Dipper Seven Stars patterns on Pei Yan's chest armor had just begun to emit frost, but they were forcefully extinguished by the nine python patterns entwined around the mace tip. The scorching breath spewing from the inverted dragon scale armor actually sucked the geothermal pool into a vacuum!

Xu Yunfan's tendons and membranes exploded like thunder, the Red Python Mountain-Crushing Strength pouring out almost entirely. The moment the mace tip touched the armor, Pei Yan was horrified to realize that the sword qi in his San Jiao meridians was melting away like snow meeting boiling oil. It was the威压 (might) of an Eight-rank Divine Weapon seeping from the gaps in the dragon scale armor, capable of melting the very essence of strength!
