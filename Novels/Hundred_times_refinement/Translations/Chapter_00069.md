# Chapter 19: Playing the Pig to Eat the Tiger  

The elderly man eyed the unremarkable youth before him—only at the second layer of the Lingdong stage—and spoke with evident indifference, "Junior Brother, what brings you here?"  

Lin Xuan observed the man's expression and demeanor with cold amusement. *What a joke—this trash thinks he can look down on others?* The world of cultivators truly had no room for sentiment.  

Though inwardly disdainful, Lin Xuan revealed none of it. Instead, he feigned hesitation and said, "Senior Brother, I was hoping to secure an easy position in the Alchemy Hall."  

As the saying went, the path of immortality was arduous. Even with spiritual roots, most cultivators remained stagnant at the Lingdong stage their entire lives. Some, disheartened and unwilling to endure hardship, sought comfortable positions within the sect to idle away their days.  

The old man before him was one such individual.  

Misinterpreting Lin Xuan's words, the elder assumed he was of the same ilk—a misconception Lin Xuan had deliberately cultivated to further his plans.  

"This... is quite difficult," the elder frowned, feigning reluctance. "Although I oversee miscellaneous affairs at Danxia Mountain, all subordinate positions are currently filled. I'm afraid I can't help you, Junior Brother."  

*Old fox.* Lin Xuan cursed inwardly. He was meticulous by nature, never acting without thorough preparation. He had already investigated beforehand—there were indeed vacancies. The elder was simply playing hard to get, likely angling for a bribe.  

This was precisely what Lin Xuan had anticipated. Corruption was rampant even among cultivators. Suppressing a sneer, he maintained his naïve facade, stammering, "P-please, Senior Brother, help me out. Without spiritual roots, my cultivation is hopeless. I'd rather live comfortably as a steward. If you could arrange this... I’d be willing to offer my gratitude."  

With that, he produced a cloth-wrapped bundle from his robes, carefully unwrapping layer after layer with exaggerated secrecy.  

The elder’s interest was piqued. "What is this?"  

As the final layer fell away, a glimmer of translucent crystal caught the light. Though only a fragment was visible, the elder’s eyes widened. "Spirit stones?"  

Spirit stones—imbued with dense natural spiritual energy—were indispensable to cultivators for cultivation, artifact forging, and combat. They served as the primary currency in the cultivation world.  

Yet spirit stone mines were scarce, and most were monopolized by powerful sects and elders. Low-level cultivators like them rarely had the chance to possess one.  

For a mere second-layer Lingdong cultivator to hold such a treasure was astonishing.  

But as the cloth fully unfolded, the elder’s excitement dimmed. It wasn’t a complete spirit stone—just a fragment, barely a quarter of a low-grade stone’s worth after accounting for energy loss.  

"I... I found this fragment by chance," Lin Xuan said humbly. "If you grant me a steward position, it’s yours."  

The elder’s greed flared. Even a fragment was substantial wealth for someone like him. Assigning a minor position was trivial—why not take the profit?  

After a theatrical pause, he sighed magnanimously, "Very well. Since you’re so sincere, how could I refuse?" He flipped through a ledger. "The Waste Pill Storage lacks a steward. You’ll take that post."  

Lin Xuan’s heart leaped—just as he had planned. Outwardly, he hesitated. "Waste Pill Storage? That’s..."  

Seeing his reluctance, the elder hastily reassured him, "Ah, but it’s the easiest job! You’ll have nothing to worry about—pure leisure! I’m doing you a favor, Junior Brother."  

"Really?" Lin Xuan feigned gullibility. "I thought ‘waste pills’ sounded bad. Thank you, Senior Brother!"  

"Think nothing of it." The elder pocketed the fragment and summoned an attendant. "Escort our new Waste Pill Storage steward to collect his token."  

As Lin Xuan departed, the elder smirked. *Fool. That storage room has no benefits at all—just trash. And yet he gave me a spirit stone fragment for it.*  

Little did he know, Lin Xuan was the true victor. Every word, every gesture had been calculated.  

Before arriving, Lin Xuan had researched Elder Feng’s character—greedy and miserly. Without a bribe, he wouldn’t lift a finger.  

Giving a whole spirit stone would have drawn unwanted attention, so Lin Xuan had deliberately broken one, offering only a fragment. Not only did this save resources, but it also kept him inconspicuous.  

Moreover, by playing the ignorant novice, he ensured Elder Feng would assign him the worst position—the Waste Pill Storage.  

Lin Xuan had already confirmed: no one cared about discarded pills. The storage room was neglected, devoid of any benefits.  

And that was exactly what he wanted.  

By being "tricked" into the role rather than seeking it, he avoided suspicion entirely.  

Elder Feng, smug in his supposed cleverness, never realized he had been outmaneuvered at every turn.  

Lin Xuan, the true mastermind, had achieved his goal flawlessly.
