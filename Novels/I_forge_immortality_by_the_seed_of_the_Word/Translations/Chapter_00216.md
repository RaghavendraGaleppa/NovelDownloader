# Chapter 214: Eight-Grade Immortal Seed

“Junior Brother, at the Welcoming Immortal Banquet earlier, Junior Brother Jun did make a move, but fortunately, he didn't cause any harm to your mount, Lu Thirty-Eight.”

Senior Sister Kong spoke as if she hadn't noticed Zhang Jing's sudden chill in tone. Or perhaps, she had, but Zhang Jing, currently only at the Foundation Establishment realm, wasn't enough to make her yield. After all, regarding status, she was also a formal direct disciple of True Monarch Yuanming, and even the Senior Disciple Sister. Naturally, she didn't need to overly concern herself with this junior brother's attitude. At least… not yet.

With that, Senior Sister Kong smiled faintly, her expression still utterly serene.

“Junior Brother Jun will visit you later to apologize and offer compensation. Junior Brother, you can simply demand more conditions then.” She paused, giving Zhang Jing a meaningful look, then continued, “Junior Brother Zhang Jing, it's best to forgive when you can. While the Celestial Immortal True Monarch ancestor of Junior Brother Jun’s clan might not be comparable to our Master, he is by no means a simple existence. He was once an undefeated figure, establishing a formidable reputation by venturing through numerous worlds beyond our domain. It's said that many powerful deities from the outer regions are his friends.”

“Yes, Junior Brother, please listen to Senior Disciple Sister. That Junior Brother Jun cannot be easily offended.” On the side, Senior Brother Jian Zhongfu and Senior Sister Zhai Sha, also from the Heavenly Realm lineage, echoed.

Hearing this, Zhang Jing fell silent. Although unwilling, he had to admit that Senior Sister Kong's words made sense. He was currently only at the Foundation Establishment realm. Even if he broke through in a few days, he would merely be a minor Golden Core realm cultivator. Even with the Grand Unity Infinite Dao Sect behind him, with Master True Monarch Yuanming's protection, and Teacher Seven Desires Divine Monarch, the thought of being secretly resented by a Celestial Immortal True Monarch sent shivers down his spine.

A Celestial Immortal True Monarch! They possessed infinite lifespan, virtually immortal and indestructible. They commanded various Grand Dao laws, capable of opening Void Grotto-Heavens with a single thought, and roaming endless worlds at will. Their very existence was comparable to a terrifying small world. Since Zhang Jing had joined the Dao Sect, the most common description he heard of Celestial Immortal True Monarchs was: "Below Celestial Immortals, all are ants!" This single phrase was enough to explain everything. Of course, Zhang Jing's willingness to consider this was also partly due to Lu Thirty-Eight not having suffered any actual harm.

Across from them, the other four direct disciples present maintained a facade of detachment, showing no intention of getting involved. Outside, they were the esteemed top ten Grotto-Heaven direct disciples, Dao Integration realm True Immortals, wielding boundless prestige. But now, this was clearly a matter between the True Monarch's direct disciples. One side was even led by the Senior Disciple Sister and two other formal disciples; how could they, mere registered disciples, dare to interfere easily?

On the other side, seeing Zhang Jing showing signs of awkwardness under the pressure from Senior Sister Kong and the others, Feng Wuyu couldn't help but sneer, then calmly said, “Heh heh, Junior Brother, no need to overthink. Just do as you wish. You have Master and various Martial Uncles standing behind you, what is there to fear? Oh, and don't forget, the Venerable Seven Desires Divine Monarch is also your teacher. That Celestial Immortal ancestor of the Jun clan wouldn’t dare touch a single hair on your head, not even with ten times his courage.”

“Unless—he wishes for his entire clan to be annihilated!”

At these words, the reception hall fell into a sudden, deathly silence. Even Senior Sister Kong, usually so composed, showed a hint of astonishment on her face. Immediately, she, like the other direct disciples, looked at Zhang Jing with extreme surprise.

Seven Desires Divine Monarch! Was that existence not an immortal magnate of the Primordial Demon Sect? Why would he be this Junior Brother Zhang Jing’s teacher? Wasn’t he just from the lower realms? Wait! The Proud Cloud Secret Realm? No, that’s not right either. A mere secret realm, no matter how monstrous his performance, shouldn't have attracted the Divine Monarch’s attention.

In an instant, as everyone watched, layers of mist seemed to suddenly shroud Zhang Jing. And in their hearts, the slight contempt they had initially felt due to his low cultivation quietly vanished. Especially the four direct disciples who were merely registered disciples of True Monarch Yuanming—their gazes upon Zhang Jing were as if they had seen a ghost.

“Junior Brother, as Senior Sister, I will ensure Junior Brother Jun offers compensation that satisfies you, and he will also be confined for three hundred years. How does that sound?” Senior Sister Kong's expression quickly returned to normal, and she asked softly, her tone now serious.

Zhang Jing glanced at Senior Brother Feng Wuyu beside him, and seeing that he had nothing more to say, he instantly understood. The next moment, Zhang Jing said in a calm tone, “Then let it be as Senior Sister wishes.”

…

Time slowly passed. In the reception hall, only Zhang Jing and Senior Brother Feng Wuyu remained.

“Junior Brother, it's not that I don’t want to help you, but reaching this level is already sufficient. If we push further, Senior Sister Kong might still concede, but it would be detrimental to you instead.” Feng Wuyu said apologetically.

Zhang Jing smiled slightly, putting away the command token Senior Sister Kong had just given him. He spoke in a gentle voice, “Senior Brother, I understand. That Senior Brother Jun’s background involves a Celestial Immortal True Monarch with a bloodline connection, so we must give him some consideration.”

“Exactly!” Feng Wuyu looked at Zhang Jing with approval. “The mighty power of Celestial Immortals and their profound methods are incomprehensible to cultivators like us, who are below Celestial Immortals. Although you have Master and the Venerable Seven Desires behind you, you still need to be cautious.”

“After all, if someone plots against you, once your dao dies and your body perishes, even if the Dao Sect’s Ancestors trace back the river of time, they won’t be able to resurrect you.”

“However—” Feng Wuyu changed his tone, smiling, “If Junior Brother were to step into the Dao Integration realm, that would be a different story. Haha, the immortal path is long and full of obstacles.”

“Thank you, Senior Brother, I have learned much,” Zhang Jing said gratefully.

…

At the Welcoming Immortal Banquet, melodious immortal music filled the air, and wondrous immortal light permeated the surroundings, highlighting the exquisite and enchanting dances of the graceful immortal spirits. Around them, numerous Grotto-Heaven cultivators mingled, clinking cups. Some discussed the Dao, others chatted idly, or played chess and practiced archery, presenting a lively scene.

Near the upper seats, Lu Thirty-Eight widened his eyes, filled with admiration. His massive head swayed continuously to the rhythm of the immortal music, appearing utterly intoxicated. “Is this the master’s usual joy?” he seemed to ponder. “Truly wonderful beyond words. I’ve finally witnessed it today.”

Across from Lu Thirty-Eight, Junior Brother Jun, clad in white robes, had quietly vanished.

…

In a nearby cave mansion.

“What? I have to visit him to apologize, not to mention trying my best to meet any conditions he puts forward? And then I have to be confined for three hundred years!”

“Senior Disciple Sister, why?”

“That fellow may be Master’s formal disciple, but my clan also has a Celestial Immortal ancestor. How dare he, a mere mud-legged Foundation Establishment realm cultivator from the lower realms, humiliate me like this?” Junior Brother Jun looked indignantly at the three Grotto-Heaven direct disciples seated above him, his words full of defiance.

“Because he is Master’s formal disciple, and because he is also… the disciple of Venerable Seven Desires Divine Monarch. Is that reason enough?”

“Oh, and the Venerable Seven Desires is an immortal Golden Immortal magnate.”

At these words, Junior Brother Jun’s expression instantly froze, his eyes filled with disbelief. “Wait, Senior Sister, you… you mean… that Foundation Establishment realm Zhang Jing, besides being True Monarch Yuanming’s disciple, also… also has an immortal Golden Immortal as a teacher?”

“How is this possible?” His voice trembled slightly.

…

Meanwhile, after seeing off Senior Brother Feng Wuyu, Zhang Jing returned to his cultivation chamber, his eyes sparkling with excitement. With a thought, on the jade slip, the "General Experience" bar began to vibrate once more. Simultaneously, the experience for his "Twenty-Four Heavens" skill began to increase little by little, making the aura around Zhang Jing grow more and more violent.

…

After an unknown period, as if everything was naturally unfolding, the torrential, volcanic aura around Zhang Jing suddenly subsided, gradually settling down. However, that faint, subtle sense of oppression became even more terrifying. He slowly opened his eyes. Within his Mud-Pill Palace, the jade slip lightly trembled.
