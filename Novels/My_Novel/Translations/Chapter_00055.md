Chapter 55: Bathing in Beast Blood, Stepping into Grade B

The winter hunt ended, and the bustling Xiong Hu Mountain was left empty.

The beasts scattered across the ground were naturally left to the servants of the Servant Hall to carry away.

Luo Fang cracked his whip, the sound loud as it sliced through the air. The group of servants hurried their steps, not daring to slack off for fear of the whip landing on their backs.

The uncle and nephew pair, however, were relaxed. Unburdened by heavy loads, they walked side by side, quietly discussing the events that had just transpired.

"You useless thing. Look at that Li Xian, then look at yourself. It just makes me angry to look at you."

"Uncle-in-law, I've figured it out. We're no match for Master Li. Losing to him back then wasn't because I'm useless, but because he's just too damn fierce."

"You useless thing, how dare you bring that up? If it weren't for you, would he be where he is today?"

"Uncle-in-law, if you had been the one in your prime back then, you might not have won either."

"What nonsense are you talking? What kind of man is your uncle-in-law? How could I lose to that little brat?"

"Master Li will be a Grade B Guard soon. I recall the highest you've ever been is a Grade C Guard. Besides, the best thing you bagged in the winter hunt was just a sika deer. How can you compare to that monster?"

"Besides, he was born to be a master. We should just kneel and kowtow to curry favor. A character like him won't bother squabbling with ants like us."

Luo Fang, however, had lost all his former arrogance, his eyes filled with worry.

He had been secretly afraid for a while now. If he could just let go of their past grudges, he would be more than willing to kneel and kowtow, play the pitiful card, and offer treasures.

But of course...

There was that incident with Li Xiaofan.

Now, it would be difficult to simply laugh and let bygones be bygones. For now, perhaps he could still live a few peaceful days.

But once that Li Xian has firmly established his footing and has the free time to deal with him, he'll have a lot to answer for.

"Damn it, who knew that kid would improve so quickly."

Meanwhile.

In the Canteen Building, Pang Long and Li Xian sat at the same table. Since the promotion had not been officially finalized yet, the Canteen Building only provided Grade C meals.

But there was no lack of meat dishes, glistening with oil and exuding a fragrant aroma, looking very appetizing.

"You kid, you've really opened my eyes."

Pang Long thought his own results were pretty good, but compared to Li Xian, they were nothing special.

"Just good luck," Li Xian said with a smile.

"Don't be so modest. To get such a harvest is a testament to your skill," Pang Long said cheerfully. "I didn't expect that in the blink of an eye, you'll be a Grade B Guard. You'll be a great help to me."

"Probably tomorrow, during the morning training, you'll be a Grade B Guard."

"As for the detailed benefits and patrol regulations, look them up yourself. I won't go into detail."

Pang Long called for a bowl of egg drop soup. He poured the soup over his rice and vegetables, slurped it up from the side, and the bowl was more than half empty in an instant.

"Is it more delicious that way?" Li Xian asked, voicing a question that had puzzled him for a long time.

"It's faster," Pang Long said, downing the soup in one gulp before putting down the bowl and chopsticks and leaving.

Li Xian heard that he had made some recent progress... getting closer and closer to the Transformed Body realm.

Xiong Hu Mountain had an endless supply of beast meat, but the taste was rather average. The chefs at the Canteen Building, however, had genuine skill.

The food they made was very much to his taste, perfectly seasoned.

Li Xian focused on his meal. The guards who came and went were all whispering among themselves. Li Xian was currently the center of attention in the manor.

Zhao Han and the other two, seeing his figure from afar, didn't even dare to greet him.

After eating and drinking his fill, the day's work was done. Li Xian, feeling unusually leisurely, decided to take a walk in the outer courtyard.

He thought back to the life-and-death struggles with the beasts, the various moments of seeking survival in danger, and couldn't help but let out a long sigh.

"It's great that I've successfully become a Grade B Guard."

"But my martial cultivation hasn't been able to keep up. I'm definitely at the bottom among the Grade B Guards."

"I need to improve as quickly as possible."

In any place, one's own strength is always the top priority. Without strength, he would have a hard time holding onto the position of Grade B Guard.

Looking at the One Union Manor as a whole, there were a total of fifteen Grade B Guards.

He strolled to a scenic spot.

Li Xian sat down on the ground, propping himself up with his hands, letting the cool wind ruffle his long hair, making the tip of his nose itch.

He looked at his reflection in the lake. In the water, he saw a handsome face, brows like peaks, eyes like stars, and hair that had grown long. Yet it didn't look messy, but rather had a touch of untamed, out-of-place freedom.

"That Madam is indeed fond of the winter hunt."

"On normal days, it's hard to even see her once, let alone hear her say so much."

Li Xian mused leisurely.

In fact, the only time the guards could see the Madam all year was on the day the winter hunt was tallied.

At other times, even the Grade A guards would find it difficult to even hear her voice.

The next day.

Morning training concluded, Pang Long walked over with a smile and announced Li Xian's promotion from [Grade C Guard] to [Grade B Guard].

This drew countless envious gazes. Few were unconvinced, for yesterday's战绩 was truly impeccable.

"Don't be envious, and don't get any other ideas."

"There's a winter hunt every year, but the only one to achieve such a result is Li Xian."

"It's no wonder the Madam has taken a special liking to him."

Pang Long stood with his hands behind his back, using Li Xian as a model to inspire the passion of the other guards.

After the group dispersed, many Grade B and Grade C guards immediately surrounded him, asking him for advice on archery techniques. As for the Grade A guards, who prided themselves on their higher status, though they also wanted to learn archery, they couldn't bring themselves to ask for advice.

This kind of thinking was truly laughable.

To those who came to ask, Li Xian didn't directly refuse. Instead, he shot two arrows and taught them a thing or two.

As for how much they could grasp, that depended on each person's aptitude.

The token for a Grade B Guard was orange-red.

He only needed to patrol for two hours a day, and roughly one night patrol per week. However, without an application or a special reason, he still could not leave the manor without permission.

In the end, it all came down to this.

Regardless of whether they were Grade A, B, C, or D, or even higher-level guards, they were still just guards—servants who had sold themselves.

If he didn't understand this clearly and angered the Madam, it would only take a frown from her to be sent right back to where he started.

"Are you Li Xian?"

"A wild rabbit, ten copper coins in reward; three sika deer, two taels and one coin; four tiger beasts, four taels and eight coins; three bear beasts, four taels and five coins."

"A total of eleven taels, four hundred and ten copper coins."

"Additionally, there is one Deer Blood Pill, one Tiger Blood Pill, and one Bear Gallbladder Pill."

"You may enter the Leisurely Martial Pavilion once."

The accountant paused his movements and looked at Li Xian carefully. "I seem to remember you were..."

"A servant? About a month or two ago, you sold yourself as a servant for over five hundred copper coins?"

His tone was hesitant and uncertain, wondering if he had misremembered.

"That's me," Li Xian nodded readily.

"Incredible, truly incredible," the accountant clapped his hands in praise. "In all my years in the manor, I've never seen someone like you."

Li Xian said modestly, "It was just good fortune, and I was fortunate to have the support of Commander Pang."

The accountant said, "The eleven taels of silver and the corresponding pills are all in this brocade pouch. Take it."

"Thank you, Uncle Xiang," Li Xian said, cupping his fists and taking it readily. The accountant's surname was Xiang, and everyone called him Uncle Xiang. What his actual given name was, no one knew anymore.

But it was said that Uncle Xiang was one of the first servants to follow the Madam, even earlier than Pang Long and Qiu Yue.

Thinking about it, that made sense. Managing the accounts was like holding the manor's lifeline. It had to be entrusted to the most trusted person.

"Right..." Uncle Xiang continued to tally the accounts, but his mouth didn't stop. "The Madam mentioned something to me."

"You hunted the Ghost-Striped Tiger and the Mother-Child Long-Tongued Bear, which is considered a merit. Aside from these rewards, there is an additional award."

"Oh? What award?" Li Xian himself hadn't heard any news about it.

Uncle Xiang was quite willing to say more. "What do you think the Madam holds the winter hunt for? It's to gather the blood of a hundred beasts for a medicinal bath."

"The excess is then bestowed as rewards."
