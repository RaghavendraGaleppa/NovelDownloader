# Chapter 9: Minor Success

He did not want to become one of them. Especially after learning that He Changgong had argued with others and was killed with a pickaxe, the sense of urgency in his heart grew increasingly intense.

Because supervisors guarded the main mine tunnels, only the most basic rules of survival were maintained there. However, once one钻入钻入 (drilled into) the branch tunnels, all rules vanished; having a bigger fist was the absolute truth.

Until the sixth day, Li Haomiao watched Xu Yunfan constantly running in and out of this branch tunnel to practice the Flying Leg Technique and could not help but speak up.

"The Flying Leg Technique tests the legs' explosive power, the coordination of the waist and hips, and the tightening of the spine. It is a method of training the tendons. If you think you can succeed just by running around like this, I’ll give you all the Body Fasting Pills—huh?!"

*Your Flying Leg Technique has entered the入门 (Entry Level).*

*Flying Leg Technique 0/500 (Entry Level)*

*Special Effects: Swift as the Wind, Agile Figure, Footprints in the Ground, Infinite Stamina)*

In an instant, Xu Yunfan's memories surged.

In his memories, he stood amidst a continuous mountain range, surrounded by rolling peaks.

Standing on the mountain, he exerted force from his feet, toes gripping the ground tightly, constantly practicing his footwork according to the energy circulation method of the Flying Leg Technique.

Day after day, he ran, disregarding the toll on his body, covering a hundred miles daily.

One day, he exerted force from the soles of his feet. His toes curled like chicken claws, and his tendons tightened like springs. A force rose from the soles of his feet, propelling him high into the air. His steps were fierce, and his entire body rushed forward like a runaway horse.

This single step spanned five or six meters.

At the same time, waves of warm currents appeared out of nowhere in his body, flowing rapidly into his waist, abdomen, and leg flesh, pulsing.

Xu Yunfan felt his legs swelling, his muscles tightening, and his tendons stretching like bowstrings before suddenly snapping back.

The sensation of having his tendons opened in such a short time—both painful and exhilarating—made him gasp sharply.

If he rolled up his pants all the way to his thighs, one could clearly see the muscles on Xu Yunfan's legs jumping, bundles of muscle fibers surging like waves, strengthening his bones.

The Flying Leg Technique had reached the Entry Level.

Xu Yunfan moved his legs around; he felt his body lighter than ever before. With a single step, it felt as if there were springs beneath his feet, propelling him five or six meters away.

It was marvelous, as if a force rising from the soles of his feet made his body light and buoyant.

He looked up at Li Haomiao. "What did you just say? What about the Body Fasting Pills?"

Li Haomiao fell silent for a moment, shook his head slightly, and remained silent.

Xu Yunfan didn't mind. He glanced at the Skills column on his attribute panel. After digging day and night these past few days, his Copper Body Art and Mining skills were on the verge of reaching Minor Success.

Especially the Copper Body Art; its proficiency had reached 488. He was only twelve points away. Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't rest halfway; he planned to push it to the max in one go.

Such clear leveling progress filled him with great enthusiasm, and he didn't feel bored in the slightest.

He moved briskly, continuing to swing his pickaxe to dig around the Ancient Source Jade Wall.

The Ancient Source Jade Wall was extremely hard. Even when he exerted all his strength, he couldn't damage it in the slightest. Over these days, Xu Yunfan had only dug out the surroundings of the Ancient Source Jade Wall, wanting to extract it entirely.

*You focus your mind, grip the pickaxe tighter, adjust your stance, and instantly feel the pickaxe is steadier. Mining proficiency has increased.*

*You clear your mind of distractions, feel the air against your body, adjust the posture of your arms, and in an instant, feel your body moving more harmoniously with the flow of air. Copper Body Art proficiency has increased.*

*...*

Three hours later, a prompt suddenly appeared in Xu Yunfan's vision.

*While mining, you suddenly have an epiphany, feeling that there is hidden meaning within the act of digging. Upon trying to contemplate it deeply, however, you cannot find its trace. Mining proficiency has quietly increased by 4 points.*

*Mining/1000 (Minor Success)*

In an instant, memories flooded in: him becoming an elite miner in this pitch-black mine, turning into a heartless digging machine, digging tirelessly for over a decade.

Until one day, as he swung his pickaxe, his movements suddenly paused. A sense of unprecedented satisfaction welled up from the bottom of his heart.

The pickaxe seemed to merge with his body, becoming an extension of his limbs that he could control at will. Every swing felt like a connection between heart and hand, smooth and unobstructed.

His body grew slightly warm, and a sensation of swelling spread.

Warm currents seemed to spring up from nowhere within him, like winding snakes, wandering freely between his arms and waist.

Wherever they passed, strength grew like spring vines, and endurance accumulated like a deep pool, endless and inexhaustible.

To say it was endless and inexhaustible was actually an illusion caused by the drastic improvement in his physical quality in a short period of time.

After reaching Minor Success in Mining, his previously frail body had become much stronger.

Xu Yunfan calmed his mind, gripped his pickaxe tightly, and stared intently at the iron ore embedded with the Ancient Source Jade Wall before him, which was now only about the height of a person. Vaguely, he felt that this human-sized ore also had its own veins.

He raised his pickaxe forcefully, gathering the strength of his entire body. His muscles bulged, and he struck down heavily along the ore's veins with speed and power far exceeding his previous limits.

With a sound of clanging metal and a shower of sparks, large chunks of ore broke off.

Previously, he needed a dozen strikes to loosen the ore slightly, but now a single strike easily shattered it.

This change fully demonstrated that his strength, speed, accuracy, and eyesight were now worlds apart from his former self.

He was very strong now. He wondered if he could kill those vicious supervisors with a single swing of his pickaxe.

Yang Gan... still needed more training!

He glanced at the system prompt on his attribute panel.

*Mining 1/1000 (Minor Success)*

*Special Effects: Cold and Heat Resistance, Steady Hands like a Rock, Keen Eyes and Meticulous Mind, Digging through Earth like Mud*

One thousand proficiency?

Following this progress, the next stage should be two thousand?

He looked at the Copper Body Art in the Skills column. Proficiency was 499. Just one more step, and he could advance the Copper Body Art to the Minor Success realm.

He lifted the pickaxe, which now felt as light as a willow twig. As he dug down the last large chunk of ore, the final point of Copper Body Art proficiency was filled.

*You circulate the Copper Body Art. The iron pickaxe in your hand feels like a hammer, seemingly touching a hint of the technique's exquisite threshold. But as your thoughts turn, you cannot grasp that thread of spirit. However, the effects of cultivation have already begun to show. Copper Body Art proficiency has quietly increased.*

*Your Copper Body Art has reached Minor Success.*

*Copper Body Art (Skin Tempering) 0/1000 (Minor Success)*

*Special Effects: Abundant Vital Qi, Strength Throughout the Body, Skin Tough as Leather, Muscles Bulging and Defined*

Minor Success Copper Body Art!

Amidst Xu Yunfan's joy, a large amount of memories regarding his cultivation of the Copper Body Art began to flow through his mind.

Inside a crude workshop, dim candlelight flickered, stretching and shrinking the surrounding shadows.

He wore coarse hemp clothes. In his hand, he held not the iron pickaxe used for mining, but a heavy iron hammer.

The head of the hammer was the size of a watermelon, and the handle was thick, covered with a luster from the sweat of his grip, reflecting a cold, hard metallic texture in the dim light.

At first, lifting this hundred-pound hammer seemed strenuous. Every swing required him to exhaust his strength and muster all his power.
