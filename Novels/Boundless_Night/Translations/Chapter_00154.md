# Chapter 154: Almost Cried From Greed

Vast lands, endless darkness. Sometimes people might wonder if the entire world has fallen into a gigantic abyss, perpetually shrouded in night mist.

The Six Paths Ancestral Court, like a candle flickering in the wind, cast a faint halo at the edge of the horizon.

On the back of the white peacock, a group of youths had brilliant light in their eyes, gazing at the approaching mountain gate, which carried their hopes of rising to prominence.

Zhou Tao, with temples tinged with white and eyes faintly glowing gold, secretly transmitted a message to Qin Ming using a secret technique.

"It's truly extraordinary that you can extract the medicinal essence from the wondrous blood yourself. Let me estimate your current potential value for you."

Qin Ming was surprised. In the Six Paths Ancestral Court, the initial foundation unit wasn't *jin* (kilograms), but "potential value."

He truly couldn't reveal his true foundation, not because he feared startling Zhou Tao, but because he worried that unfathomable old seniors in the Six Paths Ancestral Court might detain him for "study."

"What's this? Falling leaves..." A youth wondered, then his face filled with surprise.

One must know, they were soaring through clouds and mist, at an unknown height from the ground. How could they witness such a strange sight?

From the clouds and mist, leaf after leaf descended. Some glowed green, full of vitality, while others were withered yellow, as if freshly swept down by an autumn breeze, carrying a chilling aura.

Leaves danced across the sky, as if falling from above the night sky.

Long before the youths cried out, the white peacock and black crane had already begun to descend rapidly, as they had both sensed the anomaly in advance.

Zhou Tao, moreover, glowed all over, his eyes like golden lamps, piercing through the night mist to stare directly at the sky above!

A rope, as if from beyond the heavens, rapidly swooped down towards the white peacock, intending to constrict it and capture it directly.

The white peacock's strength far exceeded everyone's expectations. Its white light surged, its speed soared dramatically, and it easily evaded the rope, rushing towards the Six Paths mountain gate while continuously descending.

Those green-glowing falling leaves and withered yellow leaves now vibrated, spinning, and enveloped the two giant birds, each emitting dazzling light.

At the same time, Elder Zhou made his move. A palm swept across the void, Six Paths Energy erupted, radiating light in all directions, exploding with a thunderous roar, tearing apart the leaves dancing across the sky.

The rope descending from the night sky, like a flood dragon, swayed gently, surprisingly emitting a thunderous roar. When it touched Zhou Tao, it nearly shook him off the white peacock's back.

All the youths' expressions changed. They saw clearly that the long rope was just a crudely woven straw rope, yet as it drifted gently, lightning erupted and electric currents intertwined, making it truly terrifying.

"Roar."

Elder Zhou Tao unleashed the Tiger Roar Technique, shaking his internal organs, his essence, qi, and spirit surging. Six Paths Energy erupted, blocking the straw rope in the night sky.

"Which senior is making a move?" he asked, also serving as a warning and plea for aid to the Six Paths Ancestral Court.

He was certain this was a senior expert; otherwise, even if this straw rope were a treasure, he would have already shattered it.

As an elder of the Six Paths Ancestral Court, he possessed this confidence: once Six Paths Energy was mastered, he could shatter any spiritual artifact, secret treasure, or the like with his bare hands, as long as it was around his cultivation level.

For a moment, crane cries and peacock calls resonated, shaking the long sky.

The straw rope erupted with lightning, and the armor on Zhou Tao's body instantly exploded, turning into dust.

He felt a chill down his spine, for he had, in a sense, just died once. That armor contained life-preserving talismanic light, a "blessing" from the Young Ancestor, taking the tribulation in his stead.

The person above thought they had shattered him. The straw rope drifted, rushing towards the white peacock's neck, aiming to shackle it and capture everyone whole.

At the same time, the emerald-green leaves and withered yellow leaves all dissipated, transforming into Yin-Yang qi, which rotated and pressed down towards the white peacock.

Boom!

Suddenly, the night mist exploded!

The white peacock radiated five-colored divine light, tearing open the entire night sky, illuminating the heavens and earth. It not only repelled the straw rope but also blocked the Yin-Yang qi outside.

Simultaneously, it used its five-colored divine light to protect Zhou Tao and everyone on its back.

"Oh, I misjudged! It's an old bird, not a young one!" A voice came from the night sky.

At this moment, his blurred outline could be seen. In the thick mist high in the sky, a strange bird floated, and a dark figure stood on its back.

"Enough! How dare you act wildly near my sect's ancestral court!" Someone spoke from not far away, their voice cold with a hint of anger.

From the night mist, a small, red strange bird flew over. Its back was only the size of a tabletop, but it could carry a person and fly at extreme speed.

A middle-aged man stood upon it, his wide sleeves fluttering, enveloped in cloud and mist, possessing an extraordinary and ethereal aura.

"If I don't take your dog life, do you truly think my Six Paths sect is so decayed that it has no one left?" he said calmly, his killing intent stirring the celestial phenomena and tearing apart the sky full of night mist.

Someone actually dared to block the Six Paths mountain gate, trying to capture Zhou Tao and a group of youths. This was definitely a deliberate provocation, testing the Six Paths Ancestral Court's true strength.

This was because recent rumors suggested that the Six Paths Ancestor's health was failing, his lifespan was depleted, and he was nearing his demise.

The smaller, fiery-red strange bird carried the middle-aged man with fluttering wide sleeves into the night sky. Six energies steamed around him, shaking the night sky.

Boom!

Like a flash of lightning, he also threw a punch, its power incomparably stronger than Zhou Tao's.

The straw rope in the night sky broke, exploding into dozens of pieces!

Afterwards, the middle-aged man pursued the attacker.

"Possession? Then leave this wisp of conscious spiritual light!" he said coldly.

At the same time, within the Six Paths Ancestral Court, several ancient figures silently walked out, blending into the night.

Clearly, there was more than one provocateur.

"Did you see that? If the Six Paths Celestial Light is truly mastered, even mighty experts from the Esoteric Sect or reclusive masters from outside realms could be crushed. And I haven't even mastered it yet; my cultivation is insufficient."

Zhou Tao praised the ancestral court's supreme techniques, boosting the morale of the group of youths.

The night mist surged, and the red strange bird and the middle-aged man were no longer visible; only occasionally did light tear through the darkness in the distant sky.

"Ah..."

As the white peacock carried them into the mountain gate, a scream came from afar.

Zhou Tao exhaled a breath of stale air and said, "The battle was quick, wasn't it? That's how fierce it is. In an instant, the intruder was dealt with. That old geezer was splattered into a mess with one slap. So satisfying, blood rained down everywhere!"

He could vaguely see it, but the group of youths looked bewildered; they were too far to witness the final scene. Yet, they were still deeply shocked and incredibly excited, filled with anticipation for the Six Paths Heart Sutra!

Zhuo Ya's slender brows furrowed slightly. Her parents were both members of the Esoteric Sect and quite prominent. She understood the complex current environment; the Six Paths sect, glorious for a long time, had indeed been in decline for a while, with rumors spreading that it was failing. Could the decaying Six Paths be reborn?

Qin Ming's heart was quite unsettled. All he could see was the splendor illuminated by the fiery springs, yet outside the mountain gate, in the darkness, there was also a heavy scent of blood.

The Six Paths Ancestral Court stood with majestic yet ethereal mountains. Some mountain peaks were wreathed in white mist, with colossal palaces built of azure-gold stone appearing faintly. On other high peaks, fiery spring waterfalls cascaded, and spiritual trees swayed, radiating seven-colored light.

Even not in its prime, the Six Paths Ancestral Court still had numerous disciples; it didn't seem desolate. Figures practicing cultivation could be seen everywhere.

"You've traveled forty thousand li and must be tired. Rest for a night first. Tomorrow, I'll take you to the enlightenment ground," Zhou Tao said, then hurried away. He had many matters to report and explain.

The group of youths still lodged in the golden forest, returning to their respective wooden cabins.

In the latter half of the night, Qin Ming woke from his deepest sleep with a premonition, glimpsing a hunched old man, with hardly any hair left, floating past his window.

What's going on? He couldn't sleep soundly now. He hoped no troublesome old man was targeting him.

He had performed exceptionally well in the Land of Divine Ruin; surely, he hadn't stirred up any trouble, had he?

Qin Ming really wanted to return to Crimson Cloud City to consult with Meng Xinghai, mainly because he knew nothing about these major sects and was worried about potential problems.

The next day, after breakfast, the group of youths were all incredibly excited, about to grasp a profound cultivation technique ahead of schedule.

The Six Paths Ancestral Court covered an immense area, boasting all kinds of terrain. They were led to a stony mountain region with sparse vegetation, where broken cliffs and sheer precipices were everywhere, and caves were plentiful.

The group dispersed, entering different areas, leaving only Qin Ming, Zhuo Ya, Cao Wuji, and Cui Chongxuan behind.

"Given your outstanding performance this time, we're making an exception and giving you the opportunity to choose a wondrous technique," Zhou Tao said with a smile, his eyes bloodshot, as if he hadn't slept well the previous night.

Even Zhuo Ya and Cui Chongxuan were startled. To be given wondrous techniques right away, this was truly generous.

Cao Wuji was even dizzy with excitement. Among the four, he was the most eager for cultivation techniques. He immediately patted his chest and said, "I'll stay in the Six Paths Ancestral Court! I won't go to other sects for their assessments anymore!"

He declared his stance on the spot. Even Senior Sister Lu Yuzhi of the Jade Purity Sect, who was as beautiful as a banished immortal, instantly lost some of her otherworldly aura, her figure blurring in his mind.

Qin Ming's heart was also quite unsettled. Even if the Six Paths Ancestral Court was no longer as it once was, it still possessed considerable grandeur, actually allowing them to directly choose wondrous techniques.

He estimated that these were likely scriptures circulated in the outside world, not closely guarded secrets, but even so, it was still a very generous gesture.

Afterwards, he was almost moved to tears by greed!

This was because Zhou Tao and an old man with pale golden hair gave them a list, on which several wondrous techniques were listed as options. He... wanted to learn them all!

The old man with a head full of pale golden hair was precisely Zhou Shize. He had specifically come to see Qin Ming and nodded at him with a smile.

In fact, Qin Ming noticed that several elderly men had already passed by this spot, all seeming to glance at the four of them a few times.

"There's actually the *Golden Crow Illuminates the Night Scripture*?" Even Cui Chongxuan exclaimed, one could imagine how extraordinary this scripture was.

This was because even the Cui family couldn't collect this secret classic.

Zhou Tao smiled and said, "Calm down, it's just an incomplete scripture, but it's still equivalent to a wondrous technique."

"Is this the upper volume of the *Withering and Prosperity Scripture*?" Cao Wuji had never felt so "lavish" before, with legendary wondrous scriptures at his disposal.

Zhou Tao nodded and said, "That's right, it's this top-tier technique. The sect also preserves the lower volume of the *Withering and Prosperity Scripture*. After mastering the upper volume, you will naturally receive the subsequent cultivation technique."

"I'll choose this one!" Cao Wuji immediately decided. In the past, although he couldn't access top-tier secret classics, he had heard various legends.

The *Withering and Prosperity Scripture* not only involved the Wood element among the Five Elements but also the changes of Yin and Yang, making it one of the strongest wondrous techniques.

Zhou Shize praised, "Mm, a wise choice. In the combination of Six Paths Energy, the *Withering and Prosperity Scripture* is indispensable."

Qin Ming also looked at the list and discovered the *Divine Ape Scripture*. He immediately thought of Tang Xumi, Hu Tingwen, and others who owed him the incomplete *Divine Ape Energy* manual, which they still hadn't delivered to him.

"Is this *Light Scripture* consistent with the Young Ancestor's specialized domain?" Zhuo Ya also favored a wondrous technique.

"A continuous lineage!" Zhou Tao nodded solemnly. He, too, had risen through this wondrous technique, and the Zhou family was originally from the Young Ancestor's lineage.

Qin Ming suffered from decision paralysis. These were all excellent techniques; he wanted to practice them all. Many of the scriptures were highly renowned, making him truly dazzled by the choices.

Finally, his gaze fell upon the *River Network Scripture*. According to its description, it was also considered a top-tier wondrous technique, and the only one among these scriptures involving the domain of water.

Zhou Shize gave him a benevolent smile and said, "A very good choice. Although the name *River Network Scripture* is ordinary, its wondrous uses are endless; whoever practices it will know. Moreover, after achieving success, there's another famous classic that can continue it: the *Overturning Seas Scripture*."

This old man was a bit overly enthusiastic, helping Qin Ming analyze and clear his doubts, and even at the end, he looked like he wanted to pat his head.

Qin Ming was flattered and astonished. What was happening?

The four young extraordinary individuals were led to different areas, all with gurgling fiery springs nearby, creating a bright expanse.

Near his stone cave, Qin Ming saw a youth strolling.

The youth was about to leave, but seeing Qin Ming, he stopped again, scrutinizing him from head to toe, and said, "You're not right."

Qin Ming saw it was someone his age and greeted him back.

The youth had a handsome appearance. Although dressed in coarse linen, his temperament was outstanding. He walked step by step closer.

"You're not right either," Qin Ming said.

"What's wrong with me?" the youth asked, puzzled.

"You have premature gray hair, don't you? You must have dyed it. Your hair roots are white," Qin Ming said.

The very ethereal youth pointed at him, but then lowered his hand, saying, "Do you know what's wrong with you?"
