## Chapter 57: A Pinch of the Waist

It was no wonder they were so shocked. After all, they were all in the Saint King Realm. This meant that if Zhou Tian could make Li Lingyi kneel with a single command, he could do the same to them. How could they possibly accept that?

"Chancellor Liu, you certainly held your ground!" The Duke wiped away the golden blood from the corner of his mouth and glanced at Chancellor Liu beside him. Only two people had not released their spiritual sense just now: the Imperial Preceptor and Chancellor Liu himself!

Chancellor Liu gave a wry smile. "No wonder Zhou Yi has been applying for an external transfer these past two days. I was wondering why, since he still had to look after Zhou Tian. But now it seems Zhou Tian is far from simple..."

In the arena: "The evidence is conclusive! These individuals are suspected of murdering the Crown Princess of Qin, and by law, they shall be executed!" Zhou Tian was protected by purple runes. Li Lingyi's surging spiritual power could only halt outside these runes. Although he desperately wanted to leap out and be engulfed by the spiritual power, it was clearly not the time. He looked down at Li Lingyi and said coldly.

The projection was displayed again, scene after scene clearly visible. The faces of those few individuals turned deathly pale once more. Uncle Zhou's aura, as profound as an abyss and as vibrant as a rainbow, locked onto them. They felt like a single leaf caught in ten thousand fathoms of ocean waves, about to be crushed to dust in the next moment.

In the VIP room, Chancellor Liu frowned. "No, we still can't act. It's not quite enough. This kid did quite well earlier, but why is he a bit impulsive now?"

"Kid? He could make *you* kneel with a single command!" The Duke sneered. Chancellor Liu was choked by the remark, unsure how to respond...

On the arena, the leader's lips trembled uncontrollably. His mind was in shock. His eyes scanned the still-playing projection, trying to find some fabricated evidence. When the projection first appeared, they had all been surprised by its presence and hadn't watched carefully. Suddenly, his eyes lit up, and without thinking, he shouted loudly, "This is fake! This is fabricated! We didn't say 'kill—'" Before he could finish his sentence, he froze. A look of despair appeared in his eyes, his face turned ashen, and he collapsed to the ground.

Li Lingyi's aura also gradually calmed. He suddenly realized that the power restricting him had dissipated, and he could now stand up from the ground. However, he seemed to have aged several times over. He knew that all his efforts had been in vain.

"Now it's time!" Chancellor Liu laughed heartily. No one cared what they had specifically said; proving they had done the deed was enough.

A smile appeared on Zhou Tian's face. "I've waited so long for this exact sentence." Otherwise, if Uncle Zhou, a Great Emperor, were going to act, he would have done so long ago. Why wait and let it ferment for so long? It was all to shock their minds and make them lose their composure! The long build-up, making their minds feel like they were on a rollercoaster, had long ago made them lose their composure. Under Zhou Tian's single command that made Li Lingyi kneel, coupled with Uncle Zhou's terrifying aura, they finally lost their mental balance.

Zhou Tian slowly walked towards the person who had fallen to the ground, temporarily releasing Tian Ling, knelt down, and said with a smile, "What was your name again? My memory's terrible, I didn't remember. But it doesn't matter now. Just remember to be an ordinary person in your next life..."

Despair filled that person's eyes. He looked at Zhou Tian, who was so close, and a flash of light appeared in his hand. A long sword thrust at the purple rune shield, but it had no effect.

Zhou Tian stood up and murmured, "Actually, I really quite wanted to die... What a pity..." Having said that, he turned and left. Purple runes appeared behind him, enveloping those people like a tide. Silently, all seven individuals vanished from where they stood, leaving no trace behind.

Zhou Tian re-embraced Tian Ling, his hand resting on the spot where the Holy Spear had just struck. A large expanse of her glistening white skin was exposed there.

*Hmm, the feel isn't bad,* Zhou Tian self-justified in his mind. *I'm just preventing our Ling'er from being exposed.*

Walking to the center of the arena, Zhou Tian looked up and declared loudly, "Facts prove that I was right. I apologize again to all the audience members here and in front of the projection for affecting your viewing experience. I am sorry!" After saying this, Zhou Tian bowed nearly ninety degrees, holding the pose for about 30 seconds.

After a moment of silence, "Good!" someone started. The entire venue erupted in thunderous applause, the clapping echoing throughout the arena. Even those watching in front of the projection couldn't help but applaud, cheering for Zhou Tian.

*Excellent, excellent. The timing was just right. I'll add a drumstick to his meal when we get back,* Zhou Tian secretly gave a thumbs-up to the person he had arranged for.

Actually, even without the person Zhou Tian arranged, the people of Futian Province would have cheered for him! The people of Futian Province had a strong sense of belonging to the Heavenly Qin Empire. The Heavenly Qin Empire had ruled Futian Province for countless years, governing it in perfect order. Although the Heavenly Qin Empire was an imperial dynasty, it did not oppress its people. After all, this was their main base and also a military depot. When invading a world, high-end combat power was indispensable, but the importance of low-end combat power was equally significant. In the process of conquering various heavens, what kind of soldiers could be trusted? Naturally, their own country's soldiers. They couldn't just invade someone else's world, then conscript soldiers there to invade the next world, could they? That would be suicidal!

Therefore, the Heavenly Qin Empire, or rather, the Zhou family, greatly valued Futian Province as this massive military depot and governed it with utmost dedication. When Zhou Tian was doing this, his father, Zhou Yi, had repeatedly reminded him to consider the reactions of the people of Futian Province. After all, given his status, interfering in the Youth Grand Competition, no matter the reason, could easily create the impression of bullying with power. However, when the people of Futian Province saw Zhou Tian being so polite, apologizing to them multiple times, and given that the opposing party truly intended harm to the Crown Princess, they naturally shared a common hatred for the enemy and stood on Zhou Tian's side.

Uncle Zhou waved his hand, and Zhou Tian, Tian Ling, and their companion vanished from the arena space, not even sparing a glance for Li Lingyi, Iron Ox, or Zi Qing.

The spectators also left one after another, their faces beaming with excitement. What was supposed to be just an ordinary battle today had unexpectedly turned into such a huge "melon" (gossip/scandal). They wanted to go back and boast to their friends who hadn't come. Although their friends could also see it through the projection, the feeling of witnessing it firsthand was definitely different.

For a period of time, the people of Futian Province now had a new topic for their after-dinner conversations, though it was solely regarding this event. They had watched through the projection, and even many cultivators with profound cultivation could not discern from the projection alone that Zhou Tian had made Li Lingyi kneel solely by himself. They merely assumed that Steward Zhou had secretly assisted him.

However, in the imperial capital, a different tide of events was brewing. Those important figures had personally witnessed Zhou Tian's strange divine abilities, and each of them was profoundly shocked to the core. In the following period, invitations were sent one after another to the Qin Palace, not for Zhou Tian, of course, but for Zhou Yi. Everyone wanted to sound him out and uncover some of Zhou Tian's secrets.
