# Chapter 97: Re-attempting Foundation Establishment, Azure Dragon Appears!

Time flew by, and three months passed in the blink of an eye.

On this day, Lu Yang sat atop Skeleton Mountain, suddenly opening his eyes with a look of joy, for his physical body had finally completed the Corpse Dissolution transformation! The next second, Lu Yang vanished from his spot.

Inside the Myriad Spirit Banner.

In a desolate, empty space, twisted flesh constructed a magnificent palace, its dense blood vessels resembling tree roots entwining around the structure. These root-like vessels all spread out from the deepest part of the palace. Following them into the palace, one could see that both pillars and walls were crafted from stark white skeletons, with blood vessels wrapped around them, subtly wriggling like living things.

Terrifying, bizarre, and grotesque.

This was precisely the appearance of his physical body after the Corpse Dissolution, no longer human-shaped, shifting into countless forms every moment, indescribable, like an embodiment of chaos.

"I didn't expect this [Corpse Dissolution Immortal] path to have one last trial!" Lu Yang's expression was one of surprise. The physical transformation wasn't the end; cultivators had to re-restrain their rampaging bodies to truly master them! If unable to restrain the body, one would transform into a blood-and-flesh monster with a divine status. Yet, when ordinary cultivators reached this stage, their consciousness would already be muddled, teetering between life and death, half-asleep and half-awake. How could they still possess the ability to control their bodies?

"The difficulty is far too high... Thankfully, I'm more skilled." With the help of his Dharma Protector Spirit, Su Nü, he had successfully cultivated the *Secret Art of Severing Thoughts to See the Self and Heavenly Silkworm* a month ago, and his spiritual sense had smoothly transformed into divine sense. With the blessing of divine sense, controlling his physical body was naturally no issue.

At this moment, with a thought from Lu Yang, the colossal flesh-and-blood palace immediately began to collapse, and the chaotic phenomena returned to order under his will. In the end, only a handsome and elegant Daoist remained in its place. The Daoist wore white robes, his black hair danced like living dragons, and his entire being exuded an ethereal, transcendent aura.

[Corpse Dissolution Immortal] achieved!

Lu Yang's soul merged into his physical body. In an instant, spirit and flesh became one, a slight smile played on his lips, and his inherent status instantly elevated to an unimaginable height. Looking up at the sky, Lu Yang could even see the high-and-mighty 'Foundation Establishment Realm'. In fact, if that realm was the peak of a mountain, he now stood less than a hundred steps from its summit, similar to, or even slightly higher than, Patriarch Tingyou previously. Yet, even so, the grandeur of the 'Foundation Establishment Realm' couldn't help but fill him with awe.

Proximity, after all, was not the same as achieving. No matter how close one got to the 'Foundation Establishment Realm', even if it was just a single step away, without truly stepping in and solidifying one's Dao Foundation, there would always remain a distinction between immortal and mortal.

"Alas for the transience of my life, I envy the everlasting river."

Just then, a streak of spiritual light suddenly streaked through the air from afar, sent from the direction of the Sacred Sect. Lu Yang received it, and a token appeared.

Ascension Token!

Just as he had expected, after both parties agreed on the matter of the [Heavenly Corpse Malice], True Immortal Yinshan naturally wouldn't be stingy with a mere Foundation Establishment wonder-treasure.

"...All is ready!"

At this moment, Lu Yang was filled with determination. There's no better time than now; he would attempt Foundation Establishment immediately! With a single thought, Lu Yang made a decisive move, stepping directly towards the 'Foundation Establishment Realm'. The next second, he entered the 'Foundation Establishment Realm'! He had almost completed his ascension in a single stride!

"This is far easier than my previous life..." In his previous life, he only possessed the status of [Sage Thief], and merely ascending consumed over fifty percent of his True Qi. This life, however, was completely different. With his third-grade True Qi, the combination of [Corpse Dissolution Immortal] and [Sage Thief] statuses, complemented by his Foundation Establishment divine sense, and furthermore, having the Ascension Token to unlock the seals of the Ninefold Heavenly Gates, Lu Yang entered the 'Foundation Establishment Realm' with almost no effort. He had ample True Qi to forge his Dao Foundation, avoiding the previous life's predicament.

"Next comes the invasion of heart demons..." Lu Yang acted swiftly. The moment he entered the 'Foundation Establishment Realm', he summoned Su Nü, and the [Yama's Hall] instantly reassembled, unleashing a massive surge of power. Dharma Protector Spirit! With Su Nü present, Lu Yang was equivalent to having already grasped a Foundation Establishment status, using it to protect himself and sufficiently resist most of the heart demons within the 'Foundation Establishment Realm'.

"Eighty percent [True Qi], indeed much easier than thirty percent..." Lu Yang remained calm and unhurried. His third-grade True Qi, [True Dragon Malice], surged forth, then circled beneath his feet, its scales opening and closing, exhaling myriad clouds of qi. Clouds follow the Dragon! Above the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art* was the *Ten Thousand Chariots Dragon-Wielding Ascension Scroll*. The Dao Foundation constructed with this art was a grand chariot covered by a canopy. Wielding dragons to pull a myriad-chariot palanquin and ascend! Soon, as the clouds of qi retracted and the brilliant light receded, the form of a chariot gradually emerged, making Lu Yang's aura even more profound and ethereal.

However, Lu Yang's brows gradually furrowed.

"Something's not right..." His perception of karma was exceptionally keen. Thus, the closer his cultivation level got to Foundation Establishment, the more a sense of dread and shadow arose in his heart. Karmic ties he once couldn't sense were now extraordinarily clear, wrapping around him one by one. The more he pushed towards Foundation Establishment, the more it felt like a moth drawn to a flame, or a butterfly caught in a spider's web. This sensation made Lu Yang's expression increasingly grim, and a sudden realization dawned in his mind: "Someone is plotting against me!"

Who could it be? True Immortal Chongguang, True Immortal Yinshan, Peak Master Butian, or even Patriarch Tingyou—all the people Lu Yang knew flashed through his mind in an instant. No, that's not right! "Patriarch Tingyou was killed by Golden Core sword qi; he absolutely cannot be alive. Peak Master Butian was so severely injured; it's impossible for her to be completely recovered in just three months." "As for True Immortal Chongguang and True Immortal Yinshan, that's even less likely." The next second, a name finally leaped into Lu Yang's mind. This person's situation was too unique, so much so that he had previously overlooked them.

Suddenly, Lu Yang let out a long, turbid breath. He stopped overthinking, not because he was giving up on investigating, but because at this point, it was already too late to uncover the truth.

Lu Yang looked into the distance, only to see a figure slowly approaching within the vast, boundless 'Foundation Establishment Realm'. The newcomer moved with composure, each step incredibly steady, their footsteps echoing like great bells within the 'Foundation Establishment Realm', resembling a clear, soaring dragon's roar. When Lu Yang first looked, the figure was still extremely far away, but after only a few steps, they had already arrived close by. Golden lotuses blossomed in their wake, and a grand, deafening Buddhist chant resonated, making it impossible for Lu Yang to tear his gaze away once they stood before him.

"...It truly is you." Lu Yang's voice was cold as he stared intently at the newcomer. The figure had a full, auspicious forehead, wore golden monastic robes, and held a nine-ringed staff. The newcomer appeared as a young boy, with red lips and white teeth, and a benevolent expression. However, the small, fanged and clawed dragon clutched in his hand was the complete opposite, looking ferocious and malevolent, its golden eyes filled with murderous intent as it stared at Lu Yang.

The next second, Lu Yang felt his surroundings stiffen. The small dragon let out a low growl, its dragon eyes unblinking, reflecting all the surrounding phenomena of Lu Yang into its vision, effectively trapping him within those eyes. Dragon's golden eyes, framing heaven and earth! Lu Yang's expression remained unchanged upon seeing this, only his tone turned chilling as he uttered:

"True Immortal Panlong!"

With the appearance of the figure, the deeply hidden karmic ties finally revealed themselves. The person who had arrived was none other than True Immortal Panlong, whom Lu Yang had previously believed to be long dead!
