# Chapter 24: The Moose

A massive black eagle circled in the sky several times but found nothing.  

It then transformed into a streak of black light and vanished on the spot!  

By this time, Han Yue's fleeing light had already escaped tens of thousands of miles away!  

In terms of decisiveness and speed in escaping, Han Yue believed he had reached the level of a fourth-stage cultivator!  

Han Yue was drenched in cold sweat from the shock!  

That eagle's cry earlier undoubtedly came from a third-stage great demon!  

The oppressive pressure conveyed through that sound was the strongest demonic aura Han Yue had encountered since arriving in this world.  

The great demon must have been attracted by the golden light that appeared during the advancement of his divine ability.  

Han Yue didn't even dare risk a glance and chose to flee immediately.  

Fortunately, the [Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique] had successfully advanced, and his goal for this trip had been achieved.  

Han Yue didn't linger in the outer regions any longer. He immediately summoned his fleeing light and headed straight back to the Meat Division Market.  

Only after returning to his room did Han Yue finally have the time to carefully examine his newly advanced divine ability.  

Sinking his consciousness into his sea of awareness, Han Yue saw the [Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique] talisman shining brilliantly with golden light!  

If the talisman before advancement resembled a twisted golden light, now, after evolution, it had transformed into a thin rope woven from golden radiance.  

The talisman's capacity for divine power had expanded tenfold, greatly increasing Han Yue's endurance!  

Most importantly, after the [Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique] entered the mastery stage, Han Yue's control over the ability had significantly improved.  

This was mainly reflected in Han Yue's newfound ability to freely control his flight speed and direction while using the divine ability!  

Han Yue stood up and closed his eyes, slowly sensing the changes.  

Then, his body gradually levitated!  

Bathed in an extremely faint golden light, he hovered steadily in mid-air!  

Next, within the cramped space of the room, he began darting and weaving about.  

His speed increased from slow to fast, eventually transforming into a freely spinning golden light—extremely swift yet remarkably agile, turning at the last moment whenever he was about to hit a wall.  

Suddenly, the golden light stopped, reverting to Han Yue's form as he continued to hover in the air.  

By utilizing the [Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique] and gradually controlling his speed and movement direction, Han Yue had successfully transformed it into a flying escape technique!  

Originally, the [Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique] was more akin to a point-to-point teleportation ability—fast in movement but rigid in direction.  

Moreover, between each teleportation, Han Yue had to reveal his form before he could enter the casting state again, making the process less fluid.  

But after the advancement, the [Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique] had finally become an all-around escape technique, excelling in long-distance travel, mid-distance dashes, and close-quarters maneuvering!  

Han Yue's strength had surged once again!  

He had long awaited this day—now he could finally begin a new phase of his plan!  

Han Yue re-entered a meditative state, patiently refining the primordial energy produced by the [Heavenly Origin Treasure Lotus].  

The newly advanced [Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique] talisman was completely empty. It would take Han Yue considerable time to refill it, and he eagerly anticipated his next expedition!  

Meanwhile, in another room, Yan Xiao Liu, who was in seclusion, was frantically doing sit-ups.  

His second attempt at absorbing energy had also failed!  

He had lost another chance!  

He was exercising wildly to vent his frustration. At this moment, Xiao Liu felt his body was too weak and disappointing.  

But the truth of this world was cruel—differences in talent were real, and the influence of resources was undeniable.  

If Xiao Liu had extraordinary talent, he would have succeeded in absorbing energy long ago!  

If Xiao Liu came from a powerful aristocratic family with ample flesh and blood supplies, he would have countless opportunities for trial and error!  

Unfortunately, Xiao Liu had neither, so he could only face the final two judgments of fate!  

Several days passed in the blink of an eye. After this period of consolidation, Han Yue felt spiritually fulfilled and brimming with energy!  

He had made all preparations for his next expedition!  

Han Yue stepped out of his room, walking on air step by step until he reached the rooftop.  

Then, with a flash, he transformed into a streak of golden light, circled a few times in mid-air, and sped off into the distance.  

This golden light was nimble and agile, no longer as rigid and straightforward as Han Yue's previous fleeing light!  

Han Yue headed straight for the outer regions. With his new fleeing light, he no longer needed to pause intermittently, allowing him to reach an area fifty thousand kilometers away from the Meat Division Market in one go.  

Then, he slowed his speed, maintaining the fleeing light as he began patrolling along the mountain range.  

This place was filled with towering mountains and forests teeming with enormous shrubs hundreds of meters tall.  

Countless creatures thrived here, and this vast ecosystem supported an innumerable number of demonic beasts.  

After patrolling for most of the day, Han Yue finally found his ideal target.  

In a mountain hollow lay a massive moose.  

The moose had a brownish-gray hide covered in white spots, with two enormous three-pronged antlers atop its head.  

It was lying on the ground, fast asleep, its slow snores echoing through the air.  

Each of the moose's breaths lasted several minutes!  

Its massive heart and lungs drew in air, creating a rhythmic flow of breath at its nostrils.  

This was a second-stage demonic beast—the prey Han Yue had chosen for his hunt!  

With the advancement of the [Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique], Han Yue had finally set his sights on second-stage demonic beasts!  

He had prepared himself to the fullest extent possible.  

Activating his thread armor to protect his entire body and gripping the [Gengjin Blade Embryo] infused with thunderous energy, Han Yue transformed into a streak of golden light and charged forward!  

Aiming for the moose's neck, Han Yue flashed into existence near its head in an instant, unleashing a massive purple blade aura!  

The moment Han Yue appeared, the moose immediately awoke from its slumber!  

As the blade aura closed in, a surge of blood energy erupted from the moose's body, expanding outward!  

The blade aura clashed with the moose's energy, encountering only slight resistance before breaking through its defenses and slashing directly into its neck!  

A huge wound burst open, blood splattering everywhere as the moose let out a furious roar and rose to counterattack!  

Han Yue was too fast. By the time the blade aura struck, the moose had no time to react properly. Its hastily summoned energy was insufficient, leaving it no choice but to rely on its physical resilience.  

However, the body of a second-stage demonic beast was far tougher than that of a first-stage one.  

Han Yue had poured the maximum amount of energy he could muster into the blade aura.  

In previous battles, this blade aura had been enough to instantly kill first-stage demonic beasts!  

Yet after taking the blow, the moose only grew more frenzied!  

The massive moose stood up, towering dozens of meters tall. It roared wildly, its blood energy erupting as it unleashed an overwhelming aura!  

Then, it swung its antlers, attacking Han Yue with full force!
