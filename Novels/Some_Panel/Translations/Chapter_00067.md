# Chapter 66: Junior Brother, I'll Wait for You at the Dao Sect

“You!” Sensing the sharp sword qi pierce his head, True Monarch Yin Zhi’s expression changed, and he dared not move.

“Even Nascent Soul True Monarchs have ranks. Your Heaven and Earth Dharmic Manifestation is quite crude, barely ten feet tall, and its condensation method is ordinary—merely a low-grade demonic Dharmic Manifestation. The amount of Heavenly might you can harness is also limited, so it can’t block my sword qi,” Li Changxiao said calmly.

“Granny Tianshang, it seems we’ve won this contest, haven’t we? Please lift the restriction you secretly placed on the spirit fruits,” Jian Yuanzi said, smiling.

Granny Tianshang’s face was grim, a gloomy light flickering in her eyes. Above her head, a thought floated: "Hmph, if I can’t have it, neither can you."

Jian Yuanzi saw her cold smile and her sinister gaze darting towards the cave.

At once, a potent sword intent surged from within him, shooting straight into the sky. Though he uttered not a word, the sword intent carried a strong sense of killing and chill.

Granny Tianshang felt this powerful, resolute killing intent, and her expression involuntarily changed. She glanced at the cave, then at Jian Yuanzi, whose brows were brewing with sword intent, and her face fluctuated between gloom and clarity.

“You, Jian Yuanzi!” Granny Tianshang suddenly snorted twice, extremely unwillingly, and shot a stream of light into the cave, lifting the restriction she had placed on the Heaven Spirit Fruit tree.

Then, with a venomous look, she swept her gaze over Jian Yuanzi, Li Changxiao, and Yang Ji, before coldly commanding, “Let’s go!”

Seeing Granny Tianshang and her group depart, Jian Yuanzi slowly retracted his sword intent, though two points of coldness still lingered in his eyes.

“This Granny Tianshang isn't very strong, yet she presumes on her age and is fond of exploiting others. Backed by the Evergreen Sect in the Thousand Islands Sea, she’s grown accustomed to being arrogant and overbearing, even trying to be unreasonable. She truly doesn’t know what’s good for her.”

“Someone like her, who doesn't know when to advance or retreat, nor grasp the situation, would have died thousands upon thousands of times in other places.”

Jian Yuanzi turned and looked at Li Changxiao and Yang Ji, “My two disciples, if you ever go to the Dao Sect in the future, never emulate her.”

“When faced with an irresistible force, you must know when to bow your head. Even if a treasure is taken from you right before your eyes, you must learn to endure.”

“Only with your life intact can everything else remain.”

“Sometimes, escalating conflicts directly with a powerful expert is an extremely unwise thing to do.”

“We understand, Master!” Li Changxiao and Yang Ji nodded.

Jian Yuanzi let out a light hum, then transformed into a stream of light and rushed into the cave. When he emerged, his palm held four fist-sized spirit fruits, suspended by true essence.

These Heaven Spirit Fruits were as translucent as crystal, and within them, phenomena were actually evolving and changing. The sky, a blazing sun, dark clouds, lightning, flowing winds — they intensified, eventually producing the sound of raindrops, pattering softly like spring rain on the ground. They then cycled and transformed repeatedly, truly astonishing.

“These Heaven Spirit Fruits are low-grade Saint Fruits. The myriad phenomena within them are due to the immense spiritual essence evolving and transforming inside. They are far superior to ordinary spirit fruits. Even those with low-grade spiritual roots can significantly improve their cultivation within a single day if they consume them.”

“Xiao Ji, your spiritual roots are somewhat inferior, so for a Saint Fruit like this that can greatly enhance your cultivation speed, I would never give it up.”

Jian Yuanzi smiled, offering two Heaven Spirit Fruits to Yang Ji.

Yang Ji glanced at them, and information appeared: `Heaven Spirit Fruit: One fruit can sustain a medium-grade spiritual root for one month of normal cultivation, adding 1000 cultivation points daily.`

As expected of a Saint Fruit, one could sustain his cultivation for a month, providing him with 1000 cultivation points daily. In two months, two Heaven Spirit Fruits would provide him with a full sixty thousand cultivation points. This cultivation speed was truly more than eight times faster than the Demonic Essence Pills he currently consumed. Faster cultivation meant life; it was a race against the deadline. The faster he cultivated, the more time he would have to break through to the next realm.

Yang Ji accepted the Heaven Spirit Fruits and immediately bowed, “Thank you, Master!”

“Changxiao, these two are yours,” Jian Yuanzi then offered two Heaven Spirit Fruits to Li Changxiao.

But Li Changxiao shook his head, saying, “Give them to Junior Brother. I have already reached the peak of the Golden Core realm. Without subsequent cultivation methods, my cultivation cannot advance further, so they would be useless to me.”

Li Changxiao looked at Yang Ji and suddenly said, “Junior Brother’s spiritual roots are indeed a bit lacking. Currently, in the Foundation Establishment stage, with the Demonic Essence Pills, it’s not too apparent, but once he reaches Golden Core, that will be a major hurdle.”

“Nine Golden Core纹 (marks/layers) are considered complete, but each additional mark requires cultivation equivalent to the entire Foundation Establishment realm.”

“This requires a massive accumulation of spiritual power, which is also the energy needed to condense the Heaven and Earth Dharmic Manifestation later, requiring a long period of cultivation.”

“If one’s spiritual roots are poor and cultivation resources are also scarce, who knows how many years it would take to reach the Golden Core peak?”

“Junior Brother should take both of these Heaven Spirit Fruits. I’m going to the Dao Sect in a few days. If I can stay there, there will be abundant, inexhaustible resources. Why waste the sect’s limited resources? Giving them to Junior Brother will maximize their utilization.”

“Senior Brother, are you going to the Dao Sect?” Yang Ji suddenly looked up and asked.

“Yes, in a few days, the Ten Great Dao Sects will be widely recruiting disciples. I plan to set off for the Dao Sect. After all, without the subsequent cultivation methods for the True Adamant Divine Art, I won’t be able to condense a Heaven and Earth Dharmic Manifestation and overcome the Divine Tribulation to become a Nascent Soul True Monarch. My spells have also been mostly comprehended; they’re sufficient to support my journey to the Dao Sect and allow me to stay there.”

Li Changxiao smiled faintly and said, “Junior Brother, I’ll go ahead and scout things out for you. If I can become an inner disciple and be granted an immortal mountain, you’ll have a place to stay when you come.”

“Junior Brother wishes Senior Brother success!” Yang Ji cupped his hands.

“Thanks for your auspicious words, Junior Brother. I will,” Li Changxiao said confidently.

“In that case, my disciple, you shall take both of these Heaven Spirit Fruits,” Jian Yuanzi smiled in relief, handing over the fruits.

“Thank you, Master! Thank you, Senior Brother!” Yang Ji didn't act coy, accepting them after a bow.

“Come, let’s go back.” Jian Yuanzi grabbed the two, soared into the sky, and quickly returned to the Canglan Sect.

Three days later.

Li Changxiao departed for the Dao Sect.

As Yang Ji saw him off, Li Changxiao merely smiled and left a single sentence.

“Junior Brother, the immortal path is long; let us journey together. I’ll wait for you at the Dao Sect.”

The Dao Sect!

Yang Ji was not yet ready to go to the Dao Sect. Although there were no conditions to enter, it was very difficult to stay. His cultivation had not yet reached the Golden Core peak, and his spells had not yet reached consummation.

When all preparations were complete, Yang Ji would go, and he would strive to stay.

Inside the secret chamber.

Yang Ji now looked at himself.

[Name: Yang Ji]
[Spiritual Roots: Medium]
[Lifespan: 34/200]
[Realm: Mid Foundation Establishment (138500/204800)]
[Cultivation Method: Flowing Water Art (Low-Grade), True Adamant Divine Art (Dao-Grade)]
[Great Divine Ability: Humanoid Weapon [Volume 1] (Minor Attainment)]
[Great Divine Ability: Guizang Sword Art [Li Sword Dao (60% Sword Intent)], [Zhen Sword Dao (60% Sword Intent)], [Xun Sword Dao (60% Sword Intent)], [Dui Sword Dao (60% Sword Intent)]
[Great Divine Ability: Zhou Tian Shift (Beginner)]
[Spells: Water Seeking Sword Art (Consummation), Light Body Art (Consummation)]

Yang Ji had been in the Canglan Sect for six years. Through these six years of arduous cultivation, Humanoid Weapon had reached minor attainment. The four Sword Daos had also individually reached 60% sword intent, not far from reaching great attainment and condensing Sword Souls.

A Sword Soul, formed from sword intent, would become a tangible entity, visible to the eye and touchable by hand, like a physical sword. When imbued into any object, it could transform that object into a divine weapon, unleashing extraordinary power.
