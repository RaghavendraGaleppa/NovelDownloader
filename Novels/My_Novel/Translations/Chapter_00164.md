# Chapter 164: Broad Daylight, the Power of the Dual Pupils

That night.

Li Xian summoned the guards to the manor's main courtyard and briefly explained the situation. Some guards followed him sincerely, while others harbored complaints, yet all obeyed orders. They formed neat lines, wearing armor and wielding blades, their momentum fierce.

When the Yellow Dragon previously suppressed the manor, the soldiers were captured and later handed over to the prefectural city. However, their weapons, horses, and armor remained. Good armor was stored in the armory, and fine horses were kept in the stables.

The guards were essentially soldiers. With armor covering their bodies and Internal Qi protecting them, they were considered elite and possessed formidable strength. Their daily drills were finally being put to use.

To boost morale, Li Xian spent his own money, rewarding each person with dozens of taels. His savings were completely exhausted, leaving him with nothing.

Thus, their momentum was overwhelming.

They only waited for the Chen hour to arrive, to break into the city under the broad daylight.

On the other side.

Luo Xia wore a fish-scale treasure armor, her long hair tied into a high ponytail. Under the bed, she retrieved half a mask. It was a ferocious red face, like a demon or a Rakshasa, covering the beautiful half of her face, making her look terrifying. Her eyes shone with a sharp light, so excited that she hadn't slept all night.

She dismantled the carrying pole and assembled it into a spear. She practiced the "Red Dragon Spear" all night long.

To go to battle and kill the enemy, one should drink strong wine.

A few days ago, Luo Xia had earned fifteen taels of silver. She spent half of it on strong wine. Now, she drank half a jar, sitting in the courtyard, calculating the time.

Around the Mao hour, the sky was just beginning to light up but wasn't fully bright. It was the transition between night and day, when people were most relaxed and unguarded. Luo Xia rushed to the county army camp.

Cao Kai was a suspicious and arrogant man who looked down on everything in Qingning. He only used the prefectural and Cao soldiers, who were both elite and loyal. Although the county had many soldiers, they were left idle in the barracks, ignored.

"Who goes there?!"

The guards outside the camp had been standing watch all night. In their drowsiness, they suddenly saw a terrifying figure approaching. They immediately woke up, their hair standing on end.

Luo Xia raised her waist token, her voice hoarse like a ghost's whisper, indistinguishable as male or female. "I am here on the County Magistrate's order to mobilize the county soldiers. You are to assemble all your men within half a quarter of an hour. Anyone who resists will be executed!"

The county army commander was named "Big Belly Du." He was a tall, burly man with thick body fat. Hearing the commotion, he immediately came over. "A message from the County Magistrate?"

Luo Xia tossed him the waist token. Big Belly Du checked it and confirmed it was genuine. He frowned and asked, "What else did the County Magistrate say? Why are we being assembled?"

Luo Xia swept her gaze over him. A murderous aura spread. Big Belly Du was quite capable, but like a rabbit seeing a tiger, he was filled with terror, a breath stuck in his chest. He couldn't exhale or swallow, his face turning blue and purple.

"You are the commander here?" Luo Xia shouted. "Your discipline is lax. In normal times, I would have you flogged twenty times. But the situation is urgent today, so I'll let it go."

"Yes, yes." Big Belly Du felt as if he had been given a new lease on life. He had served in the army for twenty years and was a veteran of the prefectural city. During his military career, he had heard many stories and seen many fierce armies. This person's attire was strange, and their murderous aura was profound; they were certainly no ordinary person.

"You do not need to ask questions. You only need to follow my orders!" Luo Xia said coldly.

Undercurrents were surging in Qingning County, and the situation was becoming quite exciting.

The next day.

The Chen hour.

The dawn broke, but dark clouds hung overhead, refusing to disperse. The birds were silent, and the atmosphere was oppressive.

The city guard commander was about to change shifts and open the gates. Merchants and civilians from outside the city had already formed a long queue, preparing to enter. Suddenly, they saw a cloud of thick smoke rolling in the distance as hundreds of horsemen charged toward them.

The city guard commander shouted, "Close the gates! Close the gates! Close—"

Before he could finish his third word, a flying arrow shot him dead on the spot. Li Xian shouted loudly, "Innocent civilians, retreat quickly to avoid being accidentally harmed!"

His voice boomed like a thunderclap. The civilians and merchants in the queue had never seen such a scene. In their panic, they fled in any direction they could, surging into the city in a chaotic mass. The prefectural soldiers saw the situation was bad and tried to close the gates.

However, Li Xian's archery was exquisite. Riding on horseback and shooting was second nature to him. Although the surroundings were crowded with civilians, he aimed directly for the enemy's throat. Anyone who tried to close the gates was shot dead on the spot.

He first killed the leader, leaving the army without a head. Then he killed the prefectural soldiers, spreading terror. In this way, the city gates remained wide open, and no soldiers dared to risk closing them.

Li Xian led his three hundred guards on swift horses, moving like lightning. He had seen the Yellow Dragon attack the city and knew that the city gates were like fortresses. Even with three thousand guards, all of whom were skilled in martial arts, it would be difficult to capture them.

Disguising themselves to enter the city and then causing chaos was also a good plan, but it would inevitably lead to a situation where they had no way to retreat, surrounded on all sides, like turtles in a jar. Rather than that, it was better to break through with speed from the very beginning.

Thunderous methods! Fierce and swift!

At this moment, the commander for the shift change arrived and roared, "Close the gates! I order you to close the gates!"

He grabbed several people and threw them toward the gates. He also kicked several others to use them as human shields. However, he himself was afraid of the flying arrows and hid behind cover.

With him in command, even though Li Xian's archery was excellent, it was difficult to stop the gates from closing. If the gates were closed, the situation would be reversed.

At this time, Li Xian was only about thirty meters from the gates. He thought, "If the gates close, we'll be at a disadvantage. I must stop them at all costs!" He squeezed the horse's belly. The beast, feeling the pain, galloped faster.

The commander, fearing his might, ordered his men to shoot arrows. Li Xian used his blade to deflect them all.

When he was ten meters from the gates, Li Xian stepped on the horse's back and gently patted its head. "Good horse, bear the pain for a moment." With a powerful stomp, his body shot into the air, his momentum astonishing, and he landed outside the gates.

The gates were almost closed, with only a sliver of an opening left. The commander's face lit up with joy, and the prefectural soldiers cheered in unison. But then they suddenly felt that the last step could not be pulled no matter how hard they tried.

Li Xian's hands had already gripped the gates. With his single power, he was resisting the force of dozens of men!

"Push! Damn it, push for me!" The commander personally joined in, but it was like trying to stop a leak with a cup of water. The gap in the gates gradually widened, and his face filled with horror. He thought to himself, how could there be such a person of immense strength in this world?

One must know that the city gates were incredibly heavy, filled with solid silver inside, making them difficult to pull. Moreover, behind the gates, dozens of soldiers were desperately trying to close them.

Li Xian let out a great roar, and his Dual Pupils instantly opened. His might shook them, and the dozens of soldiers were so frightened their legs went weak. Even the commander, who had been through countless battles, was terrified and lost his composure.

Li Xian's strength was like that of a dragon or tiger, his presence like that of an immortal or Buddha. His nineteen-zhang Qi Lake churned, and he pulled with both hands.

He used a full ten zhang of Internal Qi, and the gates were pulled open wide enough for a person to pass through. Li Xian squeezed through the gap and immediately unleashed a "Yang Origin Sword Qi." In an instant, seven or eight soldiers within thirty feet were swept by the sword qi and died.

Li Xian looked around and thought to himself, "These city gates are heavy. Just pushing and pulling them has consumed most of my Internal Qi. I need to use it more sparingly!"

He sheathed his sword and drew his blade, using the Grand Luo Blade Technique paired with the "Four Directions Fist," and charged alone into the enemy ranks. It was as if he had four fists, four hands, and four blades. Those who had just seen his Dual Pupils were so scared their legs and waists went numb and couldn't escape in time, and were immediately killed.

The guards arrived at the city walls, took out iron chains, and tied them to the horses. Ding Hu shouted, "Giddy up!" The horses pulled at the gates. Dozens of strong guards also grabbed the gates with their hands and pulled with all their might.

The gates were now almost completely open. Ding Hu charged in first, shouting, "Commander, I'm here to help you!" He swung his blade and killed several people.

Ding Hu had already reached the Solid Blood Closed Pores stage. Li Xian often entrusted him with daily affairs, so he nurtured him more, teaching him martial arts, imparting essential principles, and telling him the secret of "eating essence."

However, without the Madam's permission, he did not dare to practice the "Congenital Body Cleansing Diagram." Ding Hu's killing intent was strong, forcing several prefectural soldiers to not dare approach.

Three hundred guards poured in like a school of fish. The two sides were locked in a fierce battle. The commander roared, "Block them! Reinforcements are arriving soon!"

But how could they stop them? Li Xian's strength was boundless. The fact that he had forcefully pulled open the city gates had already intimidated the soldiers. Within a two-zhang radius of him, no one dared to approach. A single glance from him made those with weak spirits almost drop their weapons and flee.

Li Xian said loudly, "County Magistrate Cao Kai has plotted rebellion. I, the Martial尉, am acting on Heaven's behalf to punish an official!"

He charged into the crowd and kicked hard, sending more than ten people tumbling. The enemy's hearts turned cold upon seeing this. With such divine might, how could they resist?

A County Magistrate rebelling, and someone acting on Heaven's behalf to punish an official... In thousands of years, this was the first time they had ever heard of such a thing!

The guards, however, were filled with excitement and morale soared. Ding Hu took the opportunity to shout, "Punish the corrupt official, glorify the manor!"

Thus, they fought their way into the city.

"Bold rebels, your crimes are heinous. Surrender and accept your punishment now!" Suddenly, the sound of high-pitched hoofbeats was heard. Cao soldiers, clad in black armor and wielding Cao family blades, had arrived as reinforcements.

There were dozens of them, followed by hundreds of prefectural soldiers. The battle at the city gates was at its most intense.

Meanwhile, in the government office, Cao Kai suddenly received the news. After a moment of shock, his expression turned ugly.

"This Li Xian is so capable. I only charged him with a crime, and he... he actually dares to say he's acting on Heaven's behalf to punish an official and wants to kill me?!"

"Cao Nuwu, go to the camp immediately and mobilize the county soldiers. We have the numbers. Let him know what it means to try to stop a cart with one's arm or to overestimate one's own strength."

"Hmph, today, it is not he who acts on Heaven's behalf, but I who will execute the rebels! To showcase the might of my Cao family!"

Cao Kai spoke loudly. His attendant, Cao Nuwu, immediately rushed to the camp. However, a quarter of an hour later, he returned with an ugly expression. "Your Honor, the camp is empty!"

"Empty?" Cao Kai asked, "Did the county army commander already lead his troops to intercept the rebels?"

"No..." Cao Nuwu said in terror, "I saw the camp was empty, so I checked around. I discovered... I discovered..."

"What did you discover?" Cao Kai roared in anger.

"I discovered that the county soldiers seem to be heading for the government office!" Cao Nuwu said.

"What!?" Cao Kai stood up from his chair, filled with panic and a sense of great foreboding. "Rebellion! Rebellion! I am the County Magistrate of Qingning. Why are they not resisting the enemy but coming to the government office? Do they want to rebel too?!"

"I... I don't know," Cao Nuwu stammered.

Cao Kai roared, "You think I'm afraid of him? Fine, fine, the heavens have truly been overturned. Go immediately and summon the three halls and two sects. Tell them to send men. I will don my armor, take up my weapon, and fight him. Let's see who loses!"

On the other side.

The Cao and prefectural soldiers' reinforcements had arrived and charged to the city gates. The two sides fought a bloody battle, blades and swords clashing. Sparks and blood splattered.

Li Xian was not afraid in the slightest. He wielded his blade and charged at the Cao soldiers. He hated the Cao family, so he would kill them first. These Cao soldiers actually used a formation, trying to trap and kill Li Xian.

Li Xian was already on guard and did not dare to go deep into the formation. After killing four or five Cao soldiers, he immediately withdrew. He would never enter the formation. In this way, the Cao soldiers could not trap him, so they could do nothing to him.

"The county soldiers have arrived!"

Suddenly, the sound of hoofbeats was heard again, and another troop arrived. The county army commander, Big Belly Du, wielding a guandao, charged at the prefectural soldiers.

The Cao and prefectural soldiers were caught off guard. Their morale was already weak. They were only barely holding on because of their numbers, hoping that reinforcements would arrive quickly to join forces and resolve the situation.

But when the reinforcements arrived, they attacked their own men. In an instant, their morale collapsed, their momentum scattered, and they became a disorganized mob. Although the Cao soldiers were elite, in this situation, they could do little.

Soon, they were all killed.

Li Xian was covered in blood, his murderous aura peerless. He charged straight for the government office. As he passed by the houses, he faintly heard the sound of children crying.

He felt a pang of guilt. This sudden attack must have frightened the innocent civilians.

Li Xian said loudly, "Fellow villagers, I am Martial尉 Li Xian. My purpose here is only to deal with Cao Kai. I will not harm a single one of you. You do not need to be afraid. Please, close your doors and stay indoors for a day."

With these words, the crying gradually faded. Some civilians even pushed open their windows to look. Seeing that it was indeed Li Xian, they smiled. "It's really the Martial尉大人."

They were no longer afraid.
