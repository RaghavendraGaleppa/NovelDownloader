# Chapter 119: Blue Moon Cave, Fellow Disciples Turning Against Each Other

Chu Ning and the others watched as five Golden Core realm elders acted simultaneously. Five beams of light, each a different color, shot towards the forest in front of them. Immediately, ripples spread through the seemingly ordinary air. A small black opening gradually appeared. As the five Golden Core realm experts continuously cast their spells, the opening grew larger, until it was wide enough for two people to pass through.

"Everyone, quickly go in!" the green-robed elder called out again.

Hearing this, everyone immediately walked towards the black hole. Chu Ning followed in the middle of the crowd, his mind solemn. He held talismans in both hands, his spiritual power ready to be infused into the artifacts worn on both wrists. Then, under the watchful eyes of the Golden Core elders, they stepped into the black hole.

When the last person's figure disappeared, the five elders withdrew their spiritual power, and the black hole instantly vanished. The Golden Core cultivators, at this moment, did not look well. Clearly, such a breaking of a restriction was not easy, even for Golden Core cultivators.

"This is truly an all-in gamble!" Elder Xie, the chubby one who had first questioned Xin Wuya, shook his head. "Breaking the restriction for two consecutive days, its strength is growing. To break it again, it would take at least another year."

Elder Mu glanced behind him, a hint of worry flashing in his eyes, and interjected, "There's no other way. With our cultivation, supporting over three hundred people entering at once is already our limit, so we had no choice but to divide them into two batches."

"Is Elder Mu worried about your junior from the family?" The chubby Elder Xie asked with a smile. "Since you're worried, why did Elder Mu still let her go? Although manpower is scarce, if you had spoken, the Sect Master would have given you face."

Elder Mu shook his head and said, "Let her go. Her aptitude is truly too poor. Let her try her luck. If, when retrieving the Wood Spirit Seed, she happens to obtain a wisp of spiritual essence to cleanse her marrow and reconstruct her bones, that would be her fortune."

The chubby Elder Xie nodded. "Indeed, the Sect Master is determined this time. If the spirit seed can truly be retrieved, this will be the only chance."

"I hope everything goes smoothly!" Elder Mu murmured to himself. At this moment, the other elders remained silent, but their gazes towards the restricted area held a hint of expectation.

...

"Whoosh!"

After landing, the first sound Chu Ning heard was the rushing of water. Then, he saw a large waterfall directly in front of him.

"Blue Moon Cave!" Chu Ning quickly realized his location. "Looks like my luck isn't bad. At least it's not a particularly dangerous place." Chu Ning muttered to himself.

According to the previous map explanation, Blue Moon Cave was located in the southwesternmost corner of the entire Spirit Realm. The disadvantage was that it was very far from the formation's location, but the advantage was that there were basically no demonic beasts here, making it a relatively safe place.

When the chubby elder explained the map earlier, he mentioned that everyone would be teleported to different locations upon entering the Spirit Realm. Most people would be teleported to normal places, but there were also some exceptions. For example, some might be directly teleported to the formation's location, while others might land in demonic beast dens, and so on.

Chu Ning had previously wondered if he could be teleported near the place he had entered and exited last time, as it seemed very close to the formation's location. However, it was clear that his wish did not come true; he was teleported in a completely different direction.

Although Blue Moon Cave was not dangerous, Chu Ning did not relax his guard in the slightest. His figure flickered and disappeared, hiding behind a large rock. He held a talisman in each hand, and his spiritual power was ready to be infused into the artifacts on his wrists at any moment. Immediately, Chu Ning's divine sense also spread out, observing the movements around him.

After confirming there was no immediate danger, Chu Ning took out the guiding needle from his storage bag. At this moment, Chu Ning saw that the needle was pointing directly northeast. "It seems the general direction on the map is accurate."

Chu Ning put away the guiding needle and prepared to walk towards the location of the formation. After a moment's thought, he released the puppet bird from his storage bag. This puppet bird could scout ahead, and although its range was only a hundred zhang, it was much farther than his divine sense range. At the same time, Chu Ning also wanted to see how much spiritual power and divine sense were consumed by controlling this puppet bird.

Spiritual power was infused into the puppet bird, and within a few breaths, it flew up directly. Chu Ning immediately took out his magic mirror and, following the instructions within, commanded the puppet bird to fly northeast. Instantly, the scenery in that direction appeared in the magic mirror.

Chu Ning, at this moment, was carefully sensing the consumption of his spiritual power and divine sense. Upon feeling this, he immediately let out a sigh of relief. The consumption of spiritual power and divine sense was far less than that of crafting talismans.

Chu Ning estimated that even if he continuously controlled it for half a day, his divine sense would be perfectly able to sustain it. With this thought, Chu Ning naturally did not retrieve it, but instead let the puppet bird fly ahead to scout.

After walking about two li, Chu Ning's steps abruptly halted. At this moment, about a hundred zhang ahead of him, a person and a beast were fighting. The demonic beast was called a Green Fire Spider, shaped like a spider, but its body was a full zhang in size. And the spider's claws were as thick as chopsticks. Currently, this Green Fire Spider was continuously spitting out webs. Unlike ordinary spiders, the webs it spat out were crimson.

Chu Ning had learned about this demonic beast before; although it looked somewhat terrifying, its strength was not high. It was only a first-order mid-grade demonic beast, roughly equivalent to a Qi Condensation fifth or sixth layer cultivator.

What surprised Chu Ning slightly was the Qi Condensation disciple fighting the demonic beast. A fellow disciple with thick eyebrows and large eyes was in the late Qi Condensation stage, having reached the seventh layer. Clearly, this person was one of the disciples who had entered a day earlier than them.

"This Blue Moon Cave is already a relatively peripheral location. Having entered a day earlier, why is this person still here? Moreover, this person is clearly at Qi Condensation seventh layer, it shouldn't be difficult to kill such a first-order mid-grade demonic beast. But he doesn't seem to be using his full strength, which is a bit strange."

Thinking this, Chu Ning naturally slowed his steps. He stayed where he was, using the large rock to obscure his figure, and continued to observe through the magic mirror in his hand and the puppet bird in the sky.

At this moment, the Qi Condensation seventh-layer disciple with thick eyebrows and large eyes appeared to be at ease under the Crimson Fire Spider's attacks. The Crimson Fire Spider attempted to get close to him several times using its webs, but failed each time. The Crimson Fire Spider also couldn't form larger webs; the man opposite held a fan-like artifact in his hand. Each swing unleashed several white magic blades, easily cutting through the webs. However, the magic blades were not aimed at the spider itself, so neither the person nor the beast could harm the other.

"Is this person collecting spider webs?" This thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind. He was thinking that if the other party continued like this, he would just bypass them and proceed. Although the sect elders outside had mentioned that it was best for everyone to travel together, for Chu Ning, he still felt it would be much more convenient to go alone.

Just then, a figure appeared within the range displayed by the magic mirror. Not tall, slightly thin and small, Chu Ning recognized him at a glance: this person was one of the Qi Condensation sixth-layer disciples who had entered together with him earlier. Because he had stood not too far from Chu Ning before, Chu Ning still had some impression of him.

"Junior Brother!" The Qi Condensation seventh-layer disciple with thick eyebrows and large eyes let out a surprised cry upon seeing the small, thin man appear. "Quick, come help! This demonic beast is extremely troublesome."

The thin man seemed a bit surprised to hear this, but he didn't hesitate in his actions, quickly moving to the thick-browed disciple's side. At the same time, he raised a hook-like artifact in his hand and attacked the Crimson Fire Spider. After a flash of golden light, the spell unleashed by the hook directly struck the Crimson Fire Spider. The Crimson Fire Spider had already been heavily depleted from its struggle with the thick-browed disciple. Now, struck by this metal-elemental spell, it was directly severely injured, collapsing to the ground and unable to move for a moment.

Seeing this scene, the thin man's face showed a slight hint of bewilderment. "Senior Brother, this demonic beast isn't that troublesome..." He had barely spoken half his sentence before he stopped.

At that moment, several white magic blades shot directly from the thick-browed disciple's fan, striking the thin man. The distance between the two was so close, and the thin man's attention was entirely focused on the Crimson Fire Spider, leaving him completely unprepared. Thus, those several white magic blades struck him directly. His pupils dilated sharply. The thin man looked at the thick-browed man in shock, unable to utter a single word, and then collapsed directly to the ground.

Chu Ning watched this scene through the magic mirror, his face also filled with utter astonishment. Although he had felt a little strange when the thick-browed man called the thin man forward just now, he had never expected that the other party would directly attack a fellow disciple of a lower cultivation level.

The next moment, the thick-browed man's slightly smug laughter drifted over. "It seems it was truly correct for me to stay here and not leave. There really was an unlucky guy who would come over. My half-day of acting with this Crimson Fire Spider wasn't in vain."

As he spoke, the thick-browed man used a spell to kill the already injured Crimson Fire Spider and put it into his storage bag. He then squatted down and took the hook artifact from the thin man's hand. At the same time, he also directly took off the other party's storage bag, then stood up and left directly.

Chu Ning watched this scene, and couldn't help but sigh inwardly. He really hadn't expected that immediately after entering the Spirit Realm, he would encounter this drama of fellow disciples turning against each other, killing for treasure.

Chu Ning had indeed thought before that after entering this Spirit Realm, without the constraints of the sect and with everyone's disparate strengths, there would inevitably be some ill-intentioned individuals who might do such things. After all, even if the Golden Core elders warned that they must complete the mission together to leave the Spirit Realm, such warnings still didn't have absolute binding force. However, what Chu Ning hadn't expected was for this scene to unfold so quickly.

Chu Ning was a hundred zhang away; he neither had time to stop it just now, nor would he want to wade into such troubled waters. For him, surviving in this Spirit Realm, calmly participating in the formation-dispelling mission, and then leaving was the most important thing.

After the thick-browed youth had left for a while, Chu Ning continued to advance, using the puppet bird to scout the way. When passing by the thin man's corpse, Chu Ning casually cast a few fire spells to dispose of the body. Turning it into ash was better than leaving it exposed in the wild to be eaten by demonic beasts.

After walking a few more li, Chu Ning suddenly stopped, sighing slightly inwardly, and his gaze turned to the side. In that direction, a thick-browed young man emerged from behind a large rock. The other party had hidden earlier, not entering the puppet bird's line of sight, so Chu Ning hadn't discovered him in advance. However, Chu Ning's divine sense was powerful after all; the moment the other party made any slight movement, he immediately detected it.

"This puppet bird can only provide vision within a certain range ahead, and if there's an obstruction, it can't see. It's ultimately not as convenient as divine sense." As Chu Ning inwardly mused, his gaze fell upon the thick-browed disciple slowly approaching with a smile on his face.

"Junior Brother! This is great, ah, I finally met someone." The thick-browed disciple showed a surprised expression. "My guiding needle got lost during the teleportation, and I've been waiting here for a whole day, just to wait for Junior Brother to pass by. Let's go together."

"Alright! Traveling with Senior Brother will definitely be much safer." Chu Ning responded with a smile, then raised a finger in feigned astonishment, pointing behind the other party. "Huh, Senior Brother, don't you have a companion?"

"Ah?" The thick-browed disciple turned his head in bewilderment upon hearing Chu Ning's words. Behind him was empty; there was no companion anywhere. "Are you seeing things...?" The thick-browed disciple said, turning his head back.

What met his eyes, however, was a flash of golden light. Before he could fully react, he felt a chill at his neck. The thick-browed disciple instinctively tried to look down, and then, the next moment, his head directly fell to the ground.

Perhaps until his death, he still didn't understand what had happened.

Chu Ning's face was completely unperturbed as he killed this Qi Condensation seventh-layer disciple with a single true talisman spell transformed from a Geng Metal Sword Talisman. Evidently, this thick-browed disciple had never expected that Chu Ning had already witnessed his actions, and thus would directly strike. Otherwise, with even a shred of vigilance, he would not have been so easily dealt with.

Arriving before the opponent's corpse, Chu Ning naturally took the opponent's storage bag without ceremony. Along with it, he also took the thin man's storage bag. Chu Ning casually checked the thick-browed man's storage bag, his brow slightly furrowed with confusion. He had actually assumed that this thick-browed man, who killed others for treasure, was very likely a member of the Yin Devil Sect. He still believed that some disciples of the Yin Devil Sect could use certain methods to evade Elder Mu's divine sense secret art earlier. However, what surprised him slightly was that there was no such discovery in the thick-browed man's storage bag.

Chu Ning then searched the thick-browed man's body thoroughly, even stripping him naked to examine his body. Aside from finding a "small earthworm" (euphemism for penis) that was somewhat unsightly, there was nothing noteworthy.

"Someone in my previous life said that thick-browed people have good lives, but it's not necessarily true," Chu Ning softly muttered, then cast another Fireball spell. "It seems this person is probably just ill-intentioned, not a disciple of the Yin Devil Sect. Did I overthink it?"

Shaking his head inwardly, Chu Ning continued to walk forward.
