# Chapter 27: Acknowledging the Master

Upon hearing this, Qin Chong pondered for a moment before replying, "I only have one left, and I was hoping to use it to attempt breaking through my bottleneck."

"In that case, I'll accept six for the trade. What do you think?"

"It seems you're in great need of mid-grade spirit stones. I'm willing to make the exchange."

"Excellent! Hahaha!"

The two promptly completed the transaction.

At this point, Huo Qiang interjected, "Fellow Daoist Qin, what do you intend to do with that spirit beast pouch?" Clearly, Huo Qiang still harbored doubts and couldn't resist asking.

"Junior Brother Huo, isn't that against the rules? Our transactions here have always been不问出处，不问用途 (不问出处，不问用途)," the Meng-named cultivator immediately countered.

"Senior Brother Meng, don't misunderstand. I'm just concerned that Junior Qin might undertake something beyond his capabilities, which could lead to trouble. I wouldn't know how to explain it to Fellow Daoist Qin."

Hearing this, the Meng-named cultivator fell silent.

"Reporting to Senior Huo, I recently encountered an Earth Armor Beast in the mine tunnels. I wanted to capture it to help with digging through the rock walls and save some effort."

"Is that so? Then you must be cautious. If the beast's rank exceeds yours, prioritize your own safety."

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior Huo. I'll keep it in mind."

Having dealt with the two, Qin Chong returned to his seat.

Not long after, the trading session concluded, and Qin Chong returned to his quarters.

Unexpectedly, shortly after his return, Huo Qiang came looking for him again.

Without needing to ask, Qin Chong knew Huo Qiang was after the mid-grade spirit stones, but he had no choice but to play along and feign ignorance.

"Senior Huo, what brings you here?"

"Junior Qin, your living conditions seem a bit lacking. Should I speak to someone about arranging better accommodations for you?" Huo Qiang asked with apparent concern.

"Thank you for your kindness, Senior Huo. But I'm only here a few days each month, so there's no need to trouble yourself."

"Ah, you make a fair point. Enduring hardship in the early stages of cultivation can be beneficial—it tempers one's resolve. It's rare to see such wisdom in someone so young."

"You flatter me, Senior Huo. I don't deserve such praise."

"By the way, are you absolutely certain you have no more mid-grade spirit stones?"

After a few pleasantries, Huo Qiang finally got to the point.

"I wouldn't dare deceive you, Senior Huo. You're welcome to inspect my storage pouch." With that, Qin Chong opened his storage pouch and presented it to Huo Qiang.

"If you say there are none, then so be it. There's no need to inspect your pouch—I trust your word."

Though Huo Qiang said this, Qin Chong still sensed a faint disturbance within his storage pouch. Despite Huo Qiang being a Foundation Establishment cultivator with far stronger spiritual sense than Qin Chong, a storage pouch was still a bound item. How could its owner not notice even the slightest anomaly?

"Then could you tell me where you obtained those mid-grade spirit stones?"

"Certainly. During my last training session at Little Cang Mountain, I happened upon a Blood Spirit Fruit. Unsure of its value, I later took it to the Green Cloud Pavilion in Pingyang City. I exchanged it for a top-grade magical artifact, and the remainder was converted into those few mid-grade spirit stones."

"The Green Cloud Pavilion? They wouldn't deceive their customers. But this top-grade artifact of yours seems a bit off."

Hearing this, Qin Chong frowned slightly.

"Please enlighten me, Senior."

"This spear was likely intended to be a supreme-grade artifact, but a flaw during forging must have downgraded it to top-grade."

"Is that so? Thank you for clarifying, Senior."

"No trouble at all. But at your current level, you shouldn't be able to wield a top-grade artifact, should you?"

"Indeed, I can't use it yet. I originally planned to take it back for other clan members. As for the mid-grade spirit stones, I wanted to try breaking through my bottleneck. But after wasting one with no effect, I figured the rest were useless."

"Ah, your situation is truly unusual. When I return to the sect, I'll consult some texts. If I find anything useful, I'll send word to the Qin family to help you break through sooner."

"Thank you for your generosity, Senior."

"Very well, it's getting late. You should rest now."

With that, Huo Qiang turned and left. Qin Chong escorted him to the door and only returned inside after his figure had vanished.

"Whew!"

Qin Chong exhaled deeply.

No wonder people said that one lie required countless more to cover it up. He had truly experienced this firsthand today.

Spinning lies face-to-face was exhausting, but Qin Chong had no choice. Facing such a powerful cultivator, the slightest misstep could cost him his life.

At least he had managed to get through it. From now on, he would need to be even more cautious.

After resting for a day, Qin Chong hurried back into the mine tunnels.

His mind was preoccupied with the ant queen. Acquiring the spirit beast pouch had nearly caused trouble, so he needed to resolve this matter quickly.

Although he had set up a Five Elements Concealment Array at the hiding spot, he hadn't tested it himself and wasn't entirely confident in its effectiveness. It was best to check on it as soon as possible.

Once he entered the side tunnel, Qin Chong no longer concealed his cultivation level and sped toward the depths of the mine.

After traveling nonstop, he finally returned to the location.

The Five Elements Concealment Array was still intact, and the plump, white ant queen remained sound asleep in its hive. Relieved, Qin Chong proceeded to the next step: acknowledging the ant queen as his own before storing it in the spirit beast pouch.

Over the years, Qin Chong had studied many jade slips and had some understanding of the secret techniques for acknowledging spirit beasts and insects. However, these techniques were only basic and could at most support him up to the Foundation Establishment stage.

For now, that was enough. If he was fortunate enough to reach Foundation Establishment, he could figure out a solution then. There were always more solutions than problems.

As for this ant queen, Qin Chong wasn't sure how far it could grow or how powerful the ant swarm it produced would be.

But the fact that this ant queen could break through the incredibly hard Spirit Protection Vein, hide within the spirit stone deposits, and consume so many spirit stones suggested it was no ordinary creature.

Once everything was prepared, Qin Chong entered the Five Elements Concealment Array and began the acknowledgment ritual.

Channeling his spiritual energy, he squeezed a drop of blood essence from his middle finger and let it drip into the ant queen's mouth. At the same time, he wrapped his spiritual energy and divine sense around it, gradually merging them with his blood essence.

As the blood essence entered the ant queen's body, a force of rejection emerged. However, after persisting for a while, the resistance slowly dissipated.

Yet the ant queen seemed to have an insatiable appetite for blood essence—one drop was far from enough.

Seeing this, Qin Chong had no choice but to continue dripping blood essence while quietly activating the acknowledgment technique.

Three drops...

Four drops...

After using over a dozen drops, Qin Chong's face had turned pale, but the ant queen finally stopped consuming his blood essence—only to start voraciously devouring his spiritual energy instead.

Qin Chong had never heard of such a situation, but he was already in too deep to back out. He had no choice but to grit his teeth and let the ant queen drain his energy.

Within moments, Qin Chong felt his spiritual energy completely depleted. If this creature didn't stop soon, he would be sucked dry. In desperation, he took out a mid-grade spirit stone to replenish his energy.

Only after the spirit stone had turned to dust did the ant queen finally settle down. The acknowledgment was complete.
