# Chapter 59: Apology

"You're lying!"

This sudden roar from True Monarch Changye, imbued with the pressure of a Nascent Soul True Monarch, startled the middle-aged man.

"Father!" The middle-aged man's expression changed, and he quickly lowered his head.

"Speak. Do you know Martial Nephew Yang? You're so guilty; is there some past grudge between you and Martial Nephew Yang?" True Monarch Changye glanced at him, his face exceedingly stern, his voice also sinking.

"Father, I really don't know Martial Brother Yang." The middle-aged man inwardly groaned, secretly swallowed, and feigned composure.

"You still dare to lie in front of me?" True Monarch Changye's face showed a hint of anger, speaking in a tone of exasperation as if disappointed, "I'm telling you to speak not to scold you, but to help you. Why are you still being evasive in front of me?"

"Father..." The middle-aged man looked up, his expression hesitant.

"Speak!" True Monarch Changye said coldly.

The middle-aged man exhaled, guiltily glanced at True Monarch Changye, and then uneasily recounted the incident of snatching the beast-fire.

The more True Monarch Changye listened, the darker his expression became, his eyebrows occasionally twitching in anger.

The middle-aged man was incredibly uneasy. His expression flickered, and he hastily lowered his voice to add, "Father, that day I changed my appearance. He was only in the Qi Condensation realm; he definitely couldn't have recognized me."

"Couldn't recognize you?" True Monarch Changye glared at him. "Are you so sure Martial Nephew Yang couldn't recognize you? How can a genius blessed with such fortune be judged by common sense? It's come to this, and you're still clinging to luck? Instead of facing the problem directly, you still want to evade it! It's one thing that you took someone's beast-fire, but you actually threw him down below to fend for himself. To put it mildly, you stole his opportunity; to put it seriously, you committed murder for profit. Your way of handling things is too poor. You don't know how to leave room for maneuver. Such a style of action easily invites disaster."

True Monarch Changye sighed, "The path of cultivation is unpredictable, with ever-changing circumstances and unforeseen opportunities in life. How many acts of revenge begin with stealing someone's opportunities? I, your father, have long taught you that there should be a limit to what you strive for. If it's not your opportunity, we don't take it. If an opportunity cannot be exchanged for, we don't want it. Don't bully the weak with your cultivation. When traveling the world, you must harbor goodwill. This can help you avoid misfortune and protect your family from disaster. Have you forgotten our Chang family's ancestral teachings? I, Changye, have lived my life with a clear conscience, acting openly and honestly. How could I have a son who acts so recklessly?"

True Monarch Changye was both angry and puzzled. He looked up at the middle-aged man, who was now looking down, and suddenly shot a small sword-finger towards his arm. A drop of fresh blood suddenly splattered out, which he then drew into his palm.

"Father, what are you doing?" The middle-aged man was startled.

True Monarch Changye ignored him, instead pricking his own fingertip to draw out a drop of blood. He then cast a spell, making the two drops of blood merge in the air. The moment they fused, strange, intertwined patterns appeared on the surface of the blood.

"He is my offspring, alright, but why is he not at all like me?" True Monarch Changye said, frowning slightly as he looked at the merged blood.

The middle-aged man stood dumbfounded.

"Come, follow me to Sword Dao Peak to apologize. I hope Martial Nephew Yang can forgive you," True Monarch Changye suddenly looked up and said.

"Father, is this really necessary?" The middle-aged man's expression was quite unwilling.

"Yes!" True Monarch Changye glanced at him and said earnestly, "Martial Nephew Yang's demonstrated comprehension talent is comparable to a Spirit Body, even not inferior to a common Saint Body. Like Changxiao, he has an eighty percent chance of permanently remaining in the Dao Sect in the future. Do you know what this means? It means Martial Nephew Yang has boundless prospects, and he will bring a large amount of cultivation resources to the sect. You might even need them in the future. Bringing you to apologize today is, first, to remove any resentment in Martial Nephew Yang's heart, and second, it's for this old father's peace of mind," True Monarch Changye sighed deeply, his expression becoming two points more haggard.

Guilt instantly arose in the middle-aged man's heart. He said, "Father, do we need to prepare any gifts for apology?"

"Go get the Four-Directional Dragon Esteem Cauldron and the Hundred-Object Soul-Dust Pearl," True Monarch Changye said.

"This... won't it be too valuable?" the middle-aged man hesitated.

True Monarch Changye's expression froze. He pointed at him, saying exasperatedly, "You are truly too short-sighted, not at all like me! What is Martial Nephew Yang's status now? A Quasi-Void Refinement Seed! What doesn't he have? Whether he even accepts your apology gifts is still up for debate! Hurry, what are you still standing there for?"

"Oh."

"Wait!" True Monarch Changye frowned, suddenly calling out to him, "That's too vulgar. Go get the Immortal Spirit Tea. We'll bring tea. When we get to Sword Dao Peak later, remember to be sharp."

"Yes, yes, yes." The middle-aged man nodded repeatedly.

"Oh, Father, should I change into my original appearance later?"

"Are you foolish? What if... what if Martial Nephew Yang truly didn't recognize you? If you change into your original appearance, wouldn't you expose yourself?"

"Father's way of handling things is truly seasoned," the middle-aged man couldn't help but inwardly sweat.

"Later, speak less, do more, and be sharp!"

"Understood, Father!"

Two streaks of light flew out from Chang Dao Peak, heading directly towards Sword Dao Peak.

Inside the Sword Pavilion on Sword Dao Peak.

Jian Yuanzi and True Monarch Changye sat facing each other, while Yang Ji sat beside Jian Yuanzi.

"Senior Brother Changye, what brings you here?" Jian Yuanzi asked with a warm smile.

True Monarch Changye, while brewing tea, chuckled and said, "I have some Immortal Spirit Tea from the Cultivation Continent. After drinking it, besides increasing cultivation, it can also refresh the mind and clear thoughts. Martial Nephew Yang works hard every day comprehending the Sword Dao, so I brought some over for him."

"Oh, Immortal Spirit Tea! I've heard of it. I heard it has effects similar to Enlightenment Pills. This is indeed good tea! Disciple, quickly thank your Martial Uncle Changye," Jian Yuanzi chuckled.

"Thank you, Martial Uncle! Martial Uncle, let me brew the tea. There's no need for you to trouble yourself. Just sit comfortably," Yang Ji said, standing up.

"Brewing Immortal Spirit Tea has many particular methods. Martial Nephew hasn't encountered it before, so you might not brew it well. I'll do it; it's no trouble," True Monarch Changye smiled faintly.

Yang Ji took a look and indeed saw many intricate steps, so he nodded. He then turned his gaze to the middle-aged man standing beside True Monarch Changye. Although this person had changed his appearance, Yang Ji remembered his eyes clearly. Who else could it be but Zheng Changlin? Yang Ji had noticed him the moment he entered, and now his expression was a bit strange.

Noticing Yang Ji's scrutinizing gaze, True Monarch Changye glanced at the person beside him and smiled, "This is my son, Chang Yuan, the eldest in the family."

"Oh? So it's Senior Brother Chang Yuan! Please, quickly take a seat!" Yang Ji stood up, putting on a full show, smiling as he tried to pull Chang Yuan to sit.

True Monarch Changye, however, shook his head and chuckled, "Jian Yuan and I are Nascent Soul Old Ancestors, and Martial Nephew is a Void Refinement Seed. For such a tea gathering, Chang Yuan is not yet qualified to sit. I called him here today for the purpose of serving tea; after all, serving tea also has its particularities."

Yang Ji's actions paused slightly. Seeing "[Apology]" appear above their heads, he roughly understood the reason for their visit.
