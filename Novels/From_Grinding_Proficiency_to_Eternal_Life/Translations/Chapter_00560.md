# Chapter 560: Heaven and Earth as a Forge

With his right palm facing upward, Xu Yunfan guided the thick Eight Scenery Qi accumulated within the Xuan Dou Eight Scenery Heavenly Creation Cloud Sutra. Like a river bursting its banks, it surged forth magnificently from his palm.

"Heaven and Earth Forge, Refine!"

Xu Yunfan's spiritual will transformed into a majestic Dharma form's voice, echoing throughout Heaven and Earth.

The erupting Eight Scenery Qi instantly permeated the entire space within the "Nine Heavens Palace Five Elements Yin Yang Thunder Domain Great Array."

This Eight Scenery Qi was not merely gentle, multi-colored clouds as it appeared on the surface. It was a terrifying torrent of cloud seals imbued with the great power of "Heavenly Creation Refinement."

Each strand of cloud qi formed its own elemental phase, encompassing the Eight Scenery phenomena, carrying the overbearing refining method of recreating all things.

Blood Ancestor's expression shook with immense shock as he watched. He truly hadn't expected that after Xu Yunfan connected with the great array, his strength and aura would faintly approach the level of a Great True Person at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm.

Had he been a bit too reckless?

A thought couldn't help but flash through Blood Ancestor's mind.

He had originally thought that Xu Yunfan was merely a cultivator of one lifetime. Even if he had reached mid-Foundation Establishment, it should have been an easy task to handle. How could he possibly stand against the vast Blood Sea Foundation built over Blood Ancestor's five lifetimes?

But now, it seemed to have exceeded his expectations.

The sky was obscured by the massive diagram of the Five Elements Yin Yang Thunder Domain Array.

The earth, stirred by the Five Elements Earth Veins and ancient Earthly Evil forces, formed a thick forge base.

The surging Heaven and Earth spiritual energy drawn in by the array from all directions served as the bellows for the forge's fire.

And now, the Eight Scenery Qi filling every inch of space within the array was the most terrifying essence of all fires, the supreme catalyst.

Xu Yunfan intended to use the method of artifact refining to forcibly refine this Blood Ancestor to death!

At this moment, the summit of the Divine Thunder Peak had already transformed into a colossal Heaven and Earth forge constructed from the power of the array and the Eight Scenery Qi.

And Blood Ancestor and his filthy Blood Sea were the great medicinal ingredients forcibly confined within the forge.

Blood Ancestor's ferocious grin abruptly stopped, replaced by a shrill cry of utter terror.

"Impossible! What array is this?! You little brat! How dare you!"

His boundless Five Lifetimes Filthy Sea, which was enough to corrode the foundation of spiritual treasures, now crashed into this "Heaven and Earth Forge" like hot oil splashing into molten lead.

*Sizzle!!*

An even more piercing, millions of times more intense sound of dissolution and purification exploded in that instant.

Great Sun Pure World Fire Thunder, Nine Nether Cold Ice Devil-Suppressing Yin Thunder, Mixed Origin Earth Seal Divine Thunder, White Metal Rending Gold Dharma-Piercing Gang Thunder, Wood Life and Death Withering and Flourishing Divine Thunder, Gui Water Abyss Annihilation Evil Thunder, Void Yin Yang Annihilation Divine Thunder, and the majestic Heavenly Gang Divine Thunder of the Divine Skies to Shatter Evil!

Using the "Purple宸 Myriad Transformation Thunder Venerable Dharma Form," evolved from his Purple宸 Zhou Tian Myriad Transformation Thunder Mansion Foundation through the array, as the center, and using his boundless spiritual will as the guide, Xu Yunfan fully executed the profound meanings of the various Heavenly Thunders contained within the Divine Skies Nine宸 Xuanqiong Immortal Indestructible True Scripture.

This time, it was no longer the single Divine Skies Purple Thunder from before, but a simultaneous unleashing of myriad thunders, each possessing divine might. They perfectly cooperated with the melting power of the Eight Scenery Qi and the circulation of the Five Elements Yin Yang within the array.

Countless divine thunders of different attributes and peerless power, like billions of Thunder Department divine soldiers wielding their halberds under the command of a Thunder Venerable, fiercely struck the boiling and churning boundless Filthy Sea.

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly. With a single hand gesture, he took out the Soul Banner, which had not been used for a long time, and placed it within the array to be refined.

"Banner Master, please pay attention!"

Zhang Ziyang inside the banner dared not be negligent. He naturally understood that this thunder refinement was a great opportunity. If he could truly transform into a Star Official of the Thunder Department, then he would have hope for his path of incense-fire divinity.

Zhang Ziyang immediately commanded the numerous evil and fierce souls within the banner to plunge into a thunder pond deliberately separated by Xu Yunfan within the array, accepting the baptism of thunder.

The souls remaining in the Soul Banner now were all elite among elites, truly raised by Xu Yunfan like蛊 (poisonous insects). Being baptized by the vast positive yang and strong, flourishing power of life and death within the thunder, not many died. As long as they survived this thunder baptism, their fierce aura would naturally be completely cleansed.

By then, this Soul Banner could truly be called a Banner of Ten Thousand Spirits.

Seeing that Zhang Ziyang was still strolling leisurely within the thunder, even continuously guiding various attribute thunders for baptism, Xu Yunfan felt relieved.

If this Banner Master, with his high talent, were to die here, Xu Yunfan would be truly heartbroken.

After all, no matter how you look at it, since he had entered the banner, he was part of Xu Yunfan's foundation.

He no longer paid attention to it and raised both arms.

Chen Xuanqiong Suppressing Prison Earth Evil Thunder Method!

In an instant, it stirred the ancient Earthly Evil forces beneath the array, transforming them into heavy, black suppressing prison divine thunders entwined with thick chains. Like pillars supporting the heavens, they fiercely suppressed the core of the Blood Sea, forcibly stabilizing its filthy origin and preventing its rotation and boiling.

Supreme Clarity Source Cleansing Evil Demon Evil Thunder Method!

The purest and cleanest cyan thunder light, like sweet dew descending, yet carrying the purest power of destruction. Wherever it passed, the filthy blood light was purified into wisps of green smoke, and the wailing resentful soul remnants were directly transformed and dispersed.

Zhou Tian Dou Pivot Rending Gold Gang Sword Qi!

This was the only sword technique within the Divine Skies Nine宸 Xuanqiong Immortal Indestructible True Scripture, and it was also a thunder-attributed sword path, which was extremely extraordinary.

Countless purple-gold sword qi thunders shaped like divine swords, containing the sharpness to pierce stars and the overbearingness to tear apart the universe, shot out from the fingertips of the Dharma Form behind him. They transformed into a dense, impenetrable net of swords and thunder prison, cutting, piercing, and crushing the Filthy Sea into independent filth blood clumps, greatly weakening its overall power.

The Eight Scenery Qi was like boiling liquid crystals within the forge, enveloping each blood sea essence separated by the divine thunders.

The fundamental principle of the Eight Scenery Qi lies in artifact refinement. Turning Heaven and Earth into a forge and employing the method of artifact refinement, it naturally operates very effectively.

It was forcibly extracting the pure life essence remaining in Blood Ancestor's Blood Sea, as well as the turbid evil law fragments contained within the imprints of his five lifetimes' Foundation.

"Ah!! Bastard! You bastard!!"

Seeing Xu Yunfan actually use such a shocking and terrifying method, Blood Ancestor let out a heart-wrenching scream. Under this Heaven and Earth Forge, his body could no longer maintain its complete form as a Taoist. It transformed into a团 (lump) of filthy origin blood light, frantically struggling amidst the thunder and cloud qi, continuously shrinking, becoming purer and more viscous.

He clearly felt that his proud Filthy Sea Sinking Turbid Evil Foundation, built over five lifetimes of accumulation, was being forcibly disintegrated by this terrifying array and cloud qi.

It was being forcibly decomposed by countless divine thunders.

The Foundation, closely entangled with him, was disintegrating. And a turbid evil and filthy Foundation Establishment Core deep underground, at an unknown distance, was having its connection with Blood Ancestor severed.

Countless Blood Sea冤魂 (resentful souls) were mercilessly ground away by the thunderfire, and even more were extracted for their purest essence by the Eight Scenery Qi like alchemy, forcibly剥离 (stripped) from his own demonic soul and origin blood core.

It was comparable to a thousand cuts and ten thousand剐 (dismemberments); it was a living flaying of his Foundation.

It was millions of times more painful than any physical torture.

Xu Yunfan's expression was calm and indifferent, his eyes profound.

"Daoist Blood, now I must borrow your lifetime of cultivation to assist my ascension. If I achieve the Golden Core in the future, I will surely guide you from the sea of suffering in Samsara back to the path of immortality. Perhaps one day, you may even reach a higher level."
