# Chapter 635: Intermediate Divine Power

His true form, towering two zhang high, suddenly rose. Blue-white lightning crackled across the surface of his knotted muscles.

A lightning-shaped divine sigil between his eyebrows blazed brilliantly, piercing through the barriers of his divine kingdom to lock firmly onto that tempting golden light within the Ice Valley.

"Those weak god cores from the Western Wilds have shattered? A great gift delivered right to me!"

Tatus let out a low, thunderous laugh.

A hundred thoughts raced through his mind, but greed ultimately overcame suspicion. Though it was suspicious that shattered god cores would fly ten thousand miles to fall in the Northern Plains, news of the rampant god-hunting in the desolate Western Wilds had long spread.

He preferred to believe that some dying minor god had detonated their core, and the fragments were accidentally swept here by chaotic currents.

The aura of the god core was spreading far and wide. If he didn't hurry, someone else might beat him to it.

The gates of his divine kingdom burst open with a thunderous roar.

Thick clouds churned violently as a burly figure wreathed in thick arcs of lightning tore through the clouds, descending upon the Ice Valley with the force of ten thousand jun.

The earth trembled as spiderweb-like cracks spread from beneath Tatus's iron boots.

He bent down to grab the god core buried in the frozen soil. The tip of his finger, crackling with lightning, was merely three inches from that tempting crystal.

"The Sect Master did not deceive me."

Xu Yunfan's voice sounded like a cold wind sweeping across the plains, emerging from the shadow of a giant boulder behind him.

"Your skull is so packed with muscle that there isn't even room for a sliver of suspicion."

Xu Yunfan secretly let out a breath. In the past, he had also subconsciously used absolute power to solve problems. However, sometimes, taking a detour allowed one to leverage the most extreme power with the least amount of effort.

Using the small to move the large—nothing exemplified this better.

The giant hand Tatus extended suddenly froze.

He slowly turned around. His rock-carved face twisted in fury, knotted muscles bulged one by one, and lightning snakes danced wildly around him, ionizing the surrounding air with a pungent smell of ozone.

He looked down at Xu Yunfan, who was less than two meters tall, his bell-like eyes filled with the rage of a sovereign angered by an ant.

"Lowly mortal, you dare covet a god's possessions?!"

Di Lisi, inside the banner, hurriedly warned.

"Master, Tatus is an intermediate god who has lived for nearly six thousand years!"

Xu Yunfan took a step forward. His dark Daoist robes remained motionless in the biting wind, his eyes as calm as if he were examining livestock waiting for slaughter.

*Merely at the mid Foundation Establishment realm.*

"God? Just a bunch of parasites feeding on incense and faith. Your brute strength is a bit more durable than those废物 from the Western Wilds."

A faint, mocking smile curled at the corner of his lips.

"Perfect. I'll use you to test my hand."

Being treated with such an attitude by a mortal, Tatus roared like thunder.

"Seeking death!"

In an instant, Tatus threw a straightforward punch without any flourish.

Where the fist passed, the air was compressed into a visible white shockwave. Fierce blue-white lightning condensed into a pillar as thick as a water tank, instantly swallowing the spot where Xu Yunfan stood.

The ice cliff collapsed in the lightning, the frozen soil vaporized, and the blinding light made the entire Ice Valley as bright as day.

When the lightning faded, the spot was empty.

Tatus's pupils constricted. Driven by an instinctual warning, he instinctively leaned back.

A hand as white as jade, carrying a muffled sonic boom, brushed past the tip of his stone-carved nose.

Xu Yunfan had somehow appeared beside him, his speed leaving only an aftershadow on the retina.

"Too slow."

Xu Yunfan landed and shook his wrist, as if flicking away dust.

He looked directly into Tatus's wide eyes, which were wide with shock, and casually tossed his dark Daoist robe onto the frozen soil, revealing his lean upper body with its smooth lines yet explosive power hidden within.

Beneath his skin, the *Xuanqiong Undying Battle Golden Body*, cultivated from the *Xuanqiong Undying True Scripture of the Nine Heavens of the Divine霄*, faintly glowed.

"Let's play a bit. It'll give me a concrete understanding of my strength."

Xu Yunfan twisted his neck, the joints making popping sounds like frying beans.

He put force into his feet, the frozen soil exploding with a bang, and his body shot up like a cannonball.

In mid-air, he formed hand seals with both hands, and a low true word rumbled from the depths of his throat.

"Manifest the Law and the Image of the Earth!"

*Boom!*

The void seemed to have been struck by an invisible giant hammer, trembling violently.

Dazzling purple-gold light erupted from every pore of Xu Yunfan. The terrifying sound of bones and muscles stretching was like a dragon's roar.

As the light faded, a three-headed, six-armed martial golden body dharma form, three zhang tall, stood tall on the ice plain.

The main head of the dharma form glared furiously, a vertical eye splitting open between its eyebrows, shooting out golden light that could penetrate the void.

The left head kept its eyes closed in concentration, the character 'Lin' (Calm) Daoist pattern flowing.

The right head chanted true words, thunderous sounds rolling.

Six arms, muscles knotted like coiling dragons, were covered in purple-gold thunder scales, with threads of destructive lightning snakes wandering between the scales.

The vast and mighty pressure of the Divine霄, mixed with the Dao rhythm of Divine霄, swept through the four wilds like a tangible tsunami, actually pushing back the restless thunder clouds around Tatus by several zhang.

Xu Yunfan had not used his martial dharma form golden body for a long time.

Since he perfected the *Xuanqiong Undying True Scripture of the Nine Heavens of the Divine霄*, the martial dharma form golden body had become relatively inferior and rarely had a chance to appear.

Generally speaking, if he couldn't use the ultimate violent thunder true method to blast enemies to pieces, or even deploy thunder formations to summon billions of thunderbolts to kill enemies to no effect, then using the martial dharma form golden body to fight in close combat was tantamount to sending himself to his death.

Even the *Xuanqiong Undying Battle Golden Body* cultivated from the *Xuanqiong Undying True Scripture of the Nine Heavens of the Divine霄* was only something Xu Yunfan cultivated to greatly enhance the intensity of his soul and physical body.

Tatus showed a look of horror for the first time.

The aura emitted by this mortal before him actually made him, a god who commanded thunder, feel his soul tremble.

The pressure emitted by the opponent was by no means the power of any known divine system in the Aeterra world, and it carried a kind of blood energy from within the body, a domineering tyranny that crushed the laws of nature.

"Playing ghosts and gods!"

Horror turned into even more violent anger. Tatus roared, and his fists collided.

*Boom!*

Behind him appeared an even larger giant spirit phantom, completely condensed from the rampant blue-white lightning, towering over ten zhang high.

The phantom moved in sync with Tatus's true form. Four giant lightning fists, entwined with dazzling lightning chains as thick as buckets, tore through the air, carrying the momentum of crushing mountains, and smashed towards the three-zhang golden body from four tricky angles.

"Bring it on!"

The main head of Xu Yunfan's dharma form let out a sky-shaking battle cry.

The two golden-armored arms on the front did not dodge or evade, forming the Purple Thunder Seal and met the attack head-on.

*Boom!!!*

The four fists and two palms collided violently.

There were no flashy spiritual lights of spells, only the ultimate collision of pure power and thunder.

A visible ring-shaped shockwave swept out, scraping the frozen soil within a radius of several miles down by three feet.

Blue-white lightning and purple-gold lightning arcs frantically entangled and annihilated each other. The piercing crackling sounds mixed with the wailing of the space unable to bear the burden, like thousands of giant bells ringing in one's ears at the same time.

Tatus let out a muffled groan. The giant spirit phantom shook violently, and the lightning on one of its arms visibly dimmed.

A storm of shock surged in his heart. *How can the opponent also use thunder?*

And the way the opponent manipulated thunder was incredibly exquisite. In comparison, his own method of using thunder was completely crude and unwatchable.

The opponent actually managed to clash head-on with the giant spirit凝聚 by his divine art without falling behind.

Xu Yunfan did not hesitate. The other four arms of his dharma form had not stopped.
