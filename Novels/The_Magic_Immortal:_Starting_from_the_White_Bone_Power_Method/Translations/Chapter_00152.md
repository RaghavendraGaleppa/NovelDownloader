# Chapter 152: Rebirth Through Transformation

After seeing Li Ping off and watching the Blood Ghost Trio pack up and leave, Wang Chan thoroughly inspected Yunbai Alley from top to bottom, inside and out, accompanied by his two spirit beasts, Black Tiger and Black Water. 

He then covered the entire alley with a high-grade formation, making meticulous arrangements at every corner. Black Water and Black Tiger were stationed as guardian spirit beasts, keeping watch in secret.

With everything prepared, Wang Chan eagerly descended into the basement. In addition to the original high-grade formation, he set up another premium formation—the "Yin Mist Illusory Void Formation" that had belonged to the Blood Ghost Trio. 

This formation wasn't particularly effective at trapping enemies but excelled in concealment and illusion. Once activated, it made the basement seem as though it existed in a separate space, imbuing it with an air of profound mystery. 

He had acquired this formation by trading a premium magical artifact to the Blood Ghost Trio.

Now, with all preparations complete, only the final step remained.

Taking a deep breath, Wang Chan solemnly retrieved the Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root—the Profound Netherbone Wood.

His knowledge of Heaven-Earth Spiritual Roots was limited, gleaned only from brief mentions in ancient texts. 

These roots were among the rarest of treasures, even within the category of extraordinary artifacts. While other rare treasures could occasionally be found across the vast lands, Heaven-Earth Spiritual Roots were so scarce that even in the expansive Cloud Mist Kingdom, few had ever appeared—even first-grade ones.

He had no idea how the Blood Ghost Trio had stumbled upon one. It was truly a stroke of unimaginable luck.

Typically, when a Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root fell into the hands of a major sect, it would be carefully cultivated over thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of years. By the time it reached the third or fourth grade, it would become a cornerstone of the sect's foundation.

Depending on their type, Heaven-Earth Spiritual Roots possessed various mystical properties and could also condense spiritual seeds. These seeds, when fused with a cultivator, granted a chance to awaken corresponding divine abilities. 

The more extraordinary the root, the more perfect the seed, and the higher the grade and potency of the divine ability awakened upon fusion.

There was, however, another method—directly fusing one's body with the Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root. 

This was far more perilous than merging with demon bones or ghostly energies; it was almost always a death sentence. Even with the aid of rare treasures and the protection of powerful experts, the survival rate was less than one in a hundred.

Bearing the prefix "Heaven-Earth," these roots were inherently domineering and extraordinary. 

Yet, if one succeeded in fusion, they could undergo a complete rebirth, even gaining the potential to awaken a spiritual or even a dharma body.

Wang Chan hadn't initially recognized the root's significance. It was only when his cultivation panel alerted him that he realized he had stumbled upon a monumental opportunity.

Later, after obtaining detailed information about the Profound Netherbone Wood from the Blood Ghost Trio, he learned that this Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root ranked 361st on the official rankings.

An incredible treasure indeed.

For others, attempting to fuse with it would be tantamount to suicide. But Wang Chan had no such concerns.

"Record!"

By now, he had thoroughly mastered the abilities and transformations brought about by fusing with the Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root.

First were the physical changes after the fusion:

1. **A massive boost in cultivation**: He directly gained 107 strands of mana and true power. Unfortunately, he had now encountered a formidable bottleneck. Despite the vast reserves of power still latent within him, his progress was completely stalled. Daily cultivation yielded no further improvements. 

   However, Wang Chan wasn't worried. With the aid of the residual power within him and further real-world experience, he estimated it would take no more than two years to break through the bottleneck and reach the peak of Qi Refinement.

2. **Transformation of the True Bone Body**: 

   Originally, his bones had been pitch black. Now, they were white as jade, with swirling patterns of profound black mist. 

   The sensation was akin to the Profound Netherbone Wood itself, as though it had fully merged with his skeletal structure. 

   The sinister true power that once coursed through his bones had now vanished into the jade-like structure, undetectable even when he probed with his divine sense. It was utterly baffling!

3. **Permanent enhancement of true power and mana attributes**:

   Despite cultivating the *White Bone Devouring Strength Technique*, which produced white bone mana and white bone true power, his energy had now transformed. 

   The once-gray bone mana had turned pure black. 

   Previously, his bone mana had been purely yin-attribute—dense and refined. Now, it had evolved into supreme yin purity, elevating the yin attribute to an extraordinary level. 

   To Wang Chan, it felt even stronger than the mana produced by premium yin-attribute techniques. When manifested, it could condense into droplets of black water, completely devoid of any taint of malevolence. 

   His true power had undergone a similar transformation, though it remained supremely yin and sinister.

However, Wang Chan suspected the most significant change lay in his True Bone Body.

He had already tested its limits. With 107 strands of supreme yin-sinister true power, just how formidable had his now black-veined jade bones become?

- He could shatter both Thunder Barrier and Black Wind defenses with a single punch.  
- A single strike could obliterate the barrier of a premium defensive artifact at full enchantment.  
- An 81-layer premium Diamond Talisman? One punch.  
- An 81-layer premium Mountain Crush Talisman? One punch.  

Even a fully enchanted Mountain Seal could only withstand a single blow from his True Bone Body without breaking. 

That said, when he struck the shadowy mountain barrier of his Black Mountain Robe, he could only slightly shake it—unable to break through. 

That was power at the premium-grade level, and his True Bone Body wasn't quite there yet. 

But if he could circulate all 108 strands of true power through his bones, his body would undergo another transformation. With the enhanced attributes of his true power amplifying his current state, his True Bone Body might rival a fully enchanted premium-grade heavy attack artifact!

Second, after fusing with the Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root, he had successfully awakened a dharma body—the **Profound Netherbone Dharma Body**.

Testing it with the *White Bone Devouring Strength Technique*, he found that this dharma body increased his cultivation speed by roughly 20%. 

While 20% might seem modest, the cumulative effect over time would be substantial, effectively elevating his innate talent.

Naturally, with the dharma body came a corresponding divine ability—**Profound Netherbone Divine Ability**, also of premium grade.

When activated, it granted two forms:
1. **Nether Mist Form**: Similar to the Blood Ghost's Blood Mist Form, it allowed him to evade fatal strikes, mitigate injuries, and resist curses—an excellent survival skill.  
2. **Nether Bone Form**: Summoning a colossal phantom of dark bones, akin to the Black Toad's premium Giant Shadow ability, it provided offense and defense at the highest tier.  

Regrettably, because he had fused with the Profound Netherbone Wood, the spiritual seeds it produced were now redundant for him. 

Since the seeds derived their power from the root itself, fusing with them after already merging with the root would yield no additional benefits. 

For others, these seeds represented a chance to acquire a premium divine ability. For Wang Chan, they were little more than premium-grade pills. 

He had hoped to gain another divine ability, but that opportunity was now lost. 

Still, for anyone else, these seeds would be invaluable.

"High risk, high reward," Wang Chan mused. "Fusing with a Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root is, in a way, truly a rebirth." He had developed a taste for this instantaneous, cost-free power surge. "Pity you can only fuse with one..."

Initially, he had been ecstatic about his newfound strength. But as days passed and he continued cultivating, a peculiar realization dawned on him—the Profound Netherbone Wood and his *White Bone Devouring Strength Technique* were strangely compatible!

From the transformation of his bones from pitch black to jade-veined, to the enhancement of his mana and true power attributes, and even the subsequent awakening of the Profound Netherbone Dharma Body and divine ability...

"Could there be some hidden connection between this Heaven-Earth Spiritual Root and my cultivation method?" he wondered.

"White Bone Longevity Observation..."

"Profound Netherbone Wood..."
