# Chapter 137: Breaking the Formation, Nine Earth Demons?

Gu Yuan had actually visited the Southern Marsh Water Realm once before—just as the Dao Academy was preparing to launch its campaign against the Scarlet Moon Great River. The reason Ma Wu and the others couldn’t find him in his cave abode was precisely because he had come here.

At the time, Gu Yuan had already mastered all the techniques he could cultivate. Coincidentally, the Stone Liquid had accumulated another opportunity for him, so he decided to travel to the Southern Marsh Water Realm to investigate potential fortunes using the Stone Liquid. However, the Southern Marsh was vast, and the demonic forces were already on high alert, preparing for war. The entire region was shrouded in a massive formation, preventing Gu Yuan from getting too close. He could only observe from a distance, glimpsing a few opportunities along the outer edges of the realm—including these seven islands.

Among the seven islands, aside from the well-known spiritual resources, only one held an additional opportunity. It wasn’t the Sky Wolf Island but a lesser-known island called Ghost Stone Island, which housed a cyan "technique opportunity"—likely containing an extraordinary spell.

Yet, Gu Yuan didn’t choose this island.

First, cyan opportunities weren’t particularly rare, and selecting Ghost Stone Island outright would only arouse suspicion. He needed to leave some opportunities for others; if he claimed every fortune in the vast Southern Marsh, it would seem far too unnatural. His true target lay elsewhere.

Second, the "Cleansing Spring" itself was a valuable resource—arguably more precious than a cyan technique imprint. Obtaining it would greatly benefit his future cultivation.

Of course, these were merely his private calculations, not something he needed to share with others. With a light tap, he selected Sky Wolf Island on the map, then bowed slightly to the group and said,  

"Fellow senior brothers, I shall take my leave first. May you all return victorious from your island conquests."  

Though regretful, the others could hardly argue with Gu Yuan’s choice—not after witnessing him single-handedly slay the Azure Fire Water-Eyed Ape just days prior. Su Huazheng’s lips twitched as if he wanted to say something, but Su Jingming held him back.  

With a faint smile, Gu Yuan led Ma Wu and the others as they transformed into streaks of light, descending toward the great river below. The Qi Refinement disciples from the Bifrost Peak and a large number of common-born cultivators followed, joining the assault on Sky Wolf Island.  

The remaining groups also divided their forces according to their factions, each selecting an island to conquer before setting off on their respective campaigns.  

---  

The great river stretched endlessly, its waters rippling under the sky. A massive island shaped like a wolf’s head stood prominently, surrounded by a scattering of smaller islets that formed a small archipelago.  

The serene landscape was abruptly shattered by panicked cries.  

"Run! Humans are attacking!"  

"Quick, get to Sky Wolf Island! Seek shelter from the elders!"  

"Into the river! Flee!"  

The smaller islands teemed with lesser demons—water apes, avian beasts, serpents, and insects—most of whom had yet to achieve human forms. Only a fortunate few had refined their vocal cords enough to speak.  

These creatures had lived peacefully under the protection of the Earth Fiend Water-Sky Formation, but now, with the barrier shattered, their haven lay exposed.  

Yet, abandoning their homes was no easy choice.  

But as seven streaks of light descended, accompanied by over a hundred disciples wielding magical artifacts, the demons' hesitation vanished. Screaming in terror, they grabbed their crude weapons and fled toward Sky Wolf Island.  

But the island’s defensive formation remained sealed, indifferent to their plight.  

"Into the water! The human cultivators are coming!"  

"Don’t get caught, or they’ll skin you alive for materials!"  

The Qi Refinement disciples surged forward, forcing the demons to dive into the river in desperation.  

"Don’t waste time on these lesser demons. Secure the islands and set up formations first!"  

The command came from the leader of the group, hovering in the sky.  

"As you command, Elder!"  

The disciples swiftly dispersed, clearing the remaining demons and establishing control over the smaller islands.  

Gu Yuan paid little attention to the skirmishes, focusing instead on Sky Wolf Island. With Ma Wu and the others, he advanced toward the island, intent on securing it as a foothold for his next move.  

---  

"Senior Brother, the demonic aura around Sky Wolf Island is dense, and its formation is still active. There must be quite a few Earth Demons inside. Taking it won’t be easy," Ma Wu said grimly.  

Though the island’s spiritual spring was valuable, conquering it would be no simple task.  

If the Flying Smoke Dharma Ship were present, a single strike could obliterate the formation. But the Dao Academy clearly intended this as a trial for its disciples, leaving them to fight their own battles.  

"No matter. The academy provided us with ‘Formation-Breaking Spirit Nails.’ Though useless in direct combat, they’re perfect for dismantling formations. Rotate your attacks, and within three days, the barrier will fall. Then, we can slaughter at will."  

Gu Yuan smiled confidently.  

"With you guarding us, the demons won’t dare leave their formation. We’ll focus solely on breaking it," Lü Zijin agreed, retrieving a silver nail and hurling it toward the island’s barrier.  

The nail expanded midair, its tip spinning rapidly as it eroded the formation’s energy.  

Ma Wu and Fu Hongling followed suit, each launching their own nails while Jiang Ningxue and Song Shan stood ready to relieve them.  

By midday, the demons inside could no longer remain passive.  

"Humans! We of Sky Wolf Island bear you no grudge. Why attack us? Leave now, and we’ll each return to our own affairs!"  

Gu Yuan ignored the plea, ordering his team to continue their assault.  

"Wait! We offer thirty portions of Cleansing Spring water, a thousand spirit stones, and five second-grade treasures in exchange for your retreat!"  

Still, Gu Yuan remained silent.  

"Arrogant brat! You think slaying two Earth Demons makes you invincible? Do you truly believe we fear you? Look closely—how many Earth Demons do you think stand behind this formation?"  

The voice roared in fury.  

Then, demonic energy surged as nine Earth Demons emerged from the barrier, surrounding Gu Yuan and his group.
