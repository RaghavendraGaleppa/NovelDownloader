# Chapter 44: Disciple Wishes to Share Master's Burden

Establishing a spirit herb garden was no simple task. 

Especially one dedicated to cultivating medicinal herbs. 

It required not only an area rich in spiritual energy but also specialized formations to regulate the climate, temperature, and humidity needed for each individual herb. 

This was a massive undertaking—one that demanded vast amounts of spirit stones. 

Coincidentally, Zhang Yan was also short on spirit stones. 

Although the Golden Core elders had gifted him many treasures, it would be rather ungrateful to simply sell them for spirit stones, wouldn't it? 

Besides, he also lacked herb seeds, which represented yet another significant expense. 

"So even in the path of cultivation, one still needs to make money," Zhang Yan muttered to himself. But this was a fortunate problem to have—ordinary cultivators could only dream of such worries. 

With his spirit fields in hand, he just needed to endure a few more years to accumulate enough wealth. 

For now, the priority was to acquire some herb seeds and repair the outer walls of the spirit herb garden. 

As for the formations inside—there was no need to rush. 

After all, the herbs hadn't even been planted yet. 

---

Zhang Yan's days passed in relative leisure. 

His routine consisted of tending to the spirit fields, studying the art of herb cultivation under Zhuge Wan, and then cultivating. 

Zhuge Wan was extremely pleased with Zhang Yan. 

"This boy reminds me of myself!" 

No matter what she taught, Zhang Yan grasped and mastered it with remarkable speed. 

Every time she looked at him, she saw a reflection of her younger self. 

Despite her satisfaction, Zhuge Wan never lowered her expectations for him—in fact, she raised them even higher. 

In her eyes, Zhang Yan had the potential to become a third-rank spirit herb master. 

But only if his cultivation could keep up. 

This was something she repeatedly emphasized: whether it was herb cultivation, alchemy, or any other auxiliary path, they were all secondary. 

The most important thing was to reach higher realms of cultivation. 

As Zhuge Wan often said, the reason she became the Peak Master of Wood Spirit Peak wasn't because she had the greatest talent in herb cultivation or the deepest understanding of it. 

It was because she had the highest cultivation. 

In the past, there had been many fellow disciples more talented than her in herb cultivation. 

But where were they now? 

Nothing but a handful of bones. 

She, on the other hand, had attained the Golden Core realm, granting her ample time to study and explore the art of herb cultivation. 

Thus, she naturally became the Peak Master. 

Zhang Yan wholeheartedly agreed with this perspective. 

Especially since his spiritual root aptitude wasn't particularly good to begin with. 

Although his cultivation speed had improved due to his mastery of techniques, the bottlenecks inherent to a lower-grade spiritual root still hindered him. 

For instance... 

The bottleneck between early and mid Qi Refining stages. 

Zhang Yan had been stuck at the third level of Qi Refining for some time now. 

Despite refining his spiritual energy to a high degree of purity, the barrier to the fourth level remained unshaken. 

This frustrated him greatly. 

He had even considered using breakthrough pills. 

But in the end, he dismissed the idea. 

While breakthrough pills could hasten his progress, they would weaken his foundation. Having only been cultivating for just over a year, there was no need to rush. (Note: Breakthrough pills differ from regular cultivation pills—they are far more potent, whereas regular pills focus on nourishment and replenishment.) 

He had plenty of time to temper his spiritual energy and gradually overcome the bottleneck. 

"If only I could find a spiritual treasure to absorb and elevate my spiritual root to mid-grade..." 

His spiritual root remained a sword hanging over his head. 

A lower-grade spiritual root was simply too poor, severely limiting his cultivation speed. 

"Still, even if I were to seek such treasures, I should wait until I reach late-stage Qi Refining or even Qi Refining perfection." While his spiritual root would make advancing to Foundation Establishment difficult, at the Qi Refining stage, with enough spirit stones and herbs, the handicap wouldn't be too severe. 

One day, while meditating, he received a message from Zhuge Wan. 

"Why is Master summoning me now?" 

Zhang Yan was puzzled. He had already completed all her assigned tasks, so this summons likely pertained to something else. 

Though unsure of the specifics, he dared not delay. 

Summoning his Golden Bamboo Sword, he transformed into a golden streak of light, speeding toward Zhuge Wan's cave abode. 

Before arriving, he spotted Mu Sen piloting a flying vessel. 

"Looks like something big is happening." 

Hailing Mu Sen and boarding his vessel, Zhang Yan immediately asked, 

"Senior Brother, do you know why Master summoned us?" 

"What else could it be? It's definitely about the competition against the Verdant Spirit Sect." 

Mu Sen's expression soured as he spoke. 

"A competition? Well, that has nothing to do with me then." 

Zhang Yan smiled faintly. He had no interest in such public displays. He'd much rather tend to a couple more spirit fields than participate in some tournament. 

Farming his way to immortality was far more enjoyable—who would bother with combat? 

Upon entering the cave abode, he realized that aside from himself and Mu Sen, all his senior brothers had already gathered. 

"You should all know why I've called you here," Zhuge Wan began. "In three years, our competition against the Verdant Spirit Sect will commence. Prepare well. Those who place will be rewarded accordingly. The top three will receive five top-grade first-rank spirit herbs, and the champion will be awarded a second-rank spirit herb." 

A murmur of astonishment rippled through the disciples. 

A second-rank spirit herb for first place—that was an immensely valuable prize! 

Seeing the eager gleam in his fellow disciples' eyes, Zhang Yan finally understood just how precious the second-rank spirit herb Mo Changqing had gifted him truly was. 

"Rest assured, Master, we will give it our all!" 

Everyone present was fired up, ready to prove themselves. 

"Very well. Zhang Yan, stay behind. The rest of you may leave." 

With a wave of her hand, Zhuge Wan dismissed the others, leaving Zhang Yan standing alone, unsure why he had been singled out. 

Once the others had departed, Zhuge Wan spoke slowly, "In three years' time, you must prepare thoroughly for the competition." 

"Master, my cultivation is still weak. I fear I won't perform well," Zhang Yan replied hesitantly. He truly had no desire to compete—holding back would make him appear incompetent, but using his Equipment Panel might result in fatalities. 

"Who said anything about combat? Our competition with the Verdant Spirit Sect is in herb cultivation!" Zhuge Wan nearly laughed at his misunderstanding. 

"Herb cultivation?" 

"Indeed. The contest revolves around herb cultivation. Other sects will participate as well, but your only task is to defeat the Verdant Spirit Sect's representatives." 

When mentioning the Verdant Spirit Sect, Zhang Yan detected clear disdain in her tone. 

Hearing this, Zhang Yan's spirits lifted instantly. 

With Zhuge Wan's herb cultivation set equipped, he would essentially be a master herbalist. 

At that moment, he could only think one thing: Who could possibly stand against me? 

With that in mind, he immediately pledged his loyalty: "This disciple is honored to share Master's burden!"
