# Chapter 72: Breaking Through to Foundation Establishment!

The next day, Lu Yang left the Secret Realm of Cultivation. As for what happened within the secret realm, he naturally kept his mouth shut, and Luo Wuya also remained silent, as if Lu Yang had never been there.

As for Lu Yang, the Yun family patriarch's soul had already been purged by True Master Yinshan. He was happy to secretly profit and naturally wouldn't blab about it. To put True Master Yinshan at ease, he simply stayed put after leaving the secret realm, directly opening a cave dwelling within Yinshan Mountain to reside.

Cultivating in the mountains, time seemed to lose its meaning. In the blink of an eye, another ten years had passed.

One day, Lu Yang awoke from his seclusion. He opened his eyes and looked at the Bright Dao Jade Slip, which had been in his hand for ten years, only to find several prominent cracks on it.

"It seems this secret treasure also has its limits..."

For the past ten years, he had been activating this secret treasure almost constantly. Thanks to it, his proficiency in various fields had made significant progress: formations, talisman arts, and cultivation.

And most importantly, he had finally deduced a secret method to cultivate the *True Method of Lunar Transformation and Corpse Liberation* without triggering the Hundred Lives Book.

Lu Yang named it the *Ghost Immortal Method of Yin Spirit*.

To put it simply, it was a method of feigned death, where the soul remained guarded within, its will unwavering. Upon the body's death, the Yin Spirit would emerge, allowing the soul to persist in the world.

Using this secret method, Lu Yang could adjust his soul to a state similar to that of a Foundation Establishment True Master's soul, thereby avoiding reincarnation after his physical death. This way, he would meet the conditions for cultivating the *True Method of Lunar Transformation and Corpse Liberation* to undergo 'transformation after death' without triggering the Hundred Lives Book.

"In the next life, this will be my goal."

After all, the Saint Thief technique alone had consumed several decades of his time. The *True Method of Lunar Transformation and Corpse Liberation* was only stronger, not weaker, compared to it, and would likely take even longer to cultivate. There was definitely no chance in this lifetime.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang took out another jade slip. It recorded a secret method called 'Heaven's Secret Thievery,' which Zhao Xuhe had traded to him years ago, and it had a confidentiality restriction placed upon it.

If he could cultivate it, it could increase his chance of Foundation Establishment by another ten percent!

Lu Yang lightly tapped it. As he expected, after eighty years, the restriction on the jade slip had already dissipated, and he easily saw its contents.

"Senior Brother Zhao is truly an honest person. There aren't any omissions, and he even included annotations."

While firmly committing the Heaven's Secret Thievery technique to memory, Lu Yang mused, "Oh right, Senior Brother Zhao still owes me money in this life. Can't forget that in the next..."

Another month passed before Lu Yang left his cave dwelling.

This time, however, he heard a piece of news that greatly surprised him: During the Three Rivers Assembly, his second senior brother, Luo Wuya, had attempted to break through to Foundation Establishment, failed, and perished.

"How could this be?"

Inside True Master Yinshan's cave dwelling, Lu Yang sighed deeply, "Senior Brother Luo and I were close friends. I had thought that after emerging from seclusion this time, I could share a drink and conversation with him..."

True Master Yinshan also shook his head upon hearing this, "It's a pity about Second Brother. His cultivation method was the Saint Sect's true heritage, the *True Scripture of Heavenly Art*. After reaching perfection, the 'Heavenly Art Treasure Qi' he refined ranked third-grade. Besides that, he also cultivated a great divine ability and had a Foundation Establishment Pill. He should have had a thirty percent chance of breaking through."

Foundation Establishment was difficult, harder than ascending to the heavens.

Lu Yang was already a hundred years old in this life, and Luo Wuya was only slightly older, if at all. A thirty percent chance of breaking through to Foundation Establishment was already worth risking his life for.

Unfortunately, he lost the gamble.

After lamenting for a moment, True Master Yinshan looked at Lu Yang, "From your emergence from seclusion this time, I gather you've made up your mind and intend to attempt Foundation Establishment?"

"Senior Brother is discerning."

Lu Yang cupped his hands, took out the Yun family patriarch's soul, returned it to True Master Yinshan, and said solemnly, "After seeing Senior Brother, I plan to enter seclusion."

"Ah, you truly are a talent; you should be cultivating in the Saint Sect." True Master Yinshan stroked his beard and smiled, "Now that I think about it, I somewhat regret tampering with your fortune back on Skeleton Mountain, which made you waste thirty years for nothing. Otherwise, if you were thirty years younger, your chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment would be even higher."

Lu Yang shook his head, "Senior Brother overpraises me."

"I never speak falsely." True Master Yinshan shook his head, then with a wave of his hand, a jade tablet landed before Lu Yang, inscribed with two large characters:

Ascension!

"The Ascension Token I didn't give you back on Skeleton Mountain — you exchanged it for the Bright Dao Jade Slip. Second Brother had no use for it, and Third Brother died early on the Righteous-Demonic Battlefield."

"Take it."

Lu Yang was stunned by this, then quickly waved his hand, "Senior Brother, your kindness is too great. I cannot accept this..."

"Less nonsense." True Master Yinshan said impatiently, "If I tell you to take it, then take it. If you truly manage to achieve Foundation Establishment, it can be considered forming a good karma."

Hearing this, Lu Yang had no choice but to accept the Ascension Token. A sudden flicker of anticipation arose in his heart: His original intention for attempting Foundation Establishment this time was merely to accumulate experience for his next life. But now, with his third-grade true qi, the Saint Thief technique, and this Ascension Token, could he truly have a thirty percent chance?

There wouldn't be some kind of conspiracy, would there?

Thinking of this, Lu Yang found it somewhat amusing. There was no helping it; the Saint Sect had too many "talents," and unprovoked help truly made him uneasy.

'But even if there is a conspiracy, I'll accept it.'

'Anyway, even if I die in this life, I intend to die on the path of attempting Foundation Establishment. If I don't succeed, I'll embrace martyrdom. Whether there's a conspiracy or not doesn't matter.'

'If there really is a conspiracy, at most, I'll be more cautious in my next life...'

With this thought, Lu Yang no longer hesitated. He stood up, respectfully bowed to True Master Yinshan, and then directly turned and left.

Little did he know that after he left, another figure appeared beside True Master Yinshan.

The newcomer was a middle-aged man with a dignified demeanor and an awe-inspiring sharp aura between his brows, as if nothing in the world could stump him.

True Master Yinshan spoke first, "How is it?"

"...No."

The man shook his head, "The optimal age for breaking through to Foundation Establishment should be between seventy and eighty. This person is already over a hundred years old; the hope of a breakthrough is minuscule."

"It's a pity that although he cultivated the *True Method of Lunar Transformation and Corpse Liberation*, he hasn't completed the final transformation, failing to refine the 'Corpse Liberation Immortal' status. Otherwise, he could have increased his chances by another ten percent... But without the assistance of a Foundation Establishment True Master, you and I alone probably won't be able to force our way into that realm."

"I hope he succeeds."

"Otherwise, we'll have to risk inviting an outsider for help."

True Master Yinshan wore a helpless expression, "Senior Brother Chongguang, you are already at Foundation Establishment Consummation, and with the reincarnation of the 'Covered Lamp Flame' master, this is an opportunity not to be missed."

"Indeed, at this point, we have no choice but to take the gamble."

True Master Chongguang's expression was resolute as he said, "If I succeed, it's my fortune; if I fail, it's my fate. Moreover, the millennium tribulation is approaching. If one doesn't become a True Monarch, how can one be a chess player?"

"It's nothing more than the difference between dying early and dying late!"

"At least dying for a breakthrough is much better than being swayed by the tribulation after it arrives, becoming someone else's pawn, and finally dying in ignorance."

"You and I have both attempted Foundation Establishment; we should understand this principle."

"Senior Brother speaks truly."

True Master Yinshan nodded, seemingly recalling past events, then let out a sigh, "Qi Refinement cannot transcend, and even Foundation Establishment struggles to find true freedom."

"That's just how the world is."

True Master Chongguang's tone was indifferent, "Otherwise, why would there be talk of True Masters and True Monarchs?"

"Qi Refinement cultivators, no matter how astonishing, are still mere 'materials' that can be consumed at any time."

"Only by breaking through to Foundation Establishment are they considered 'people,' and only by achieving Golden Core are they truly high and mighty, a 'monarch' who governs myriad cultivators!"
