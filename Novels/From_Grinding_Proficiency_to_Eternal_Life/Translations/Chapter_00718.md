# Chapter 718: Nine Nether Soul-Extinguishing Thunder Killing Array

This item was refined by Xu Yunfan using the essence of Yin clouds and death qi gathered from the edge of the Sea of Bitterness, consuming a great deal of effort.

Han Shi injected his magical power into it, and the gray, misty sphere instantly expanded, spreading rapidly. Its aura perfectly merged with the eternal, decaying gray clouds above the Underworld Earth, becoming indistinguishable.

Han Shi’s figure quickly vanished into this region covered in Yin Nether Qi, disappearing completely.

He retracted all his aura, becoming one with the clouds. Through the gaps in the mist, he looked at the distant island of white bones, the seemingly dying behemoth upon it, and the cold Dao Fruit radiating a deadly allure.

On the Cloud Platform of the Divine霄 Palace, Xu Yunfan’s eyes were tightly shut, yet his mind, connected through the Attribute Panel’s strong control, silently watched the turbulent Sea of Bitterness.

Han Shi lay hidden above a massive blood wave whirlpool eight hundred miles away, perfectly concealed by the clouds. He remained silent, his expression dazed.

Xu Yunfan knew what Han Shi was thinking.

The man was slowly shifting from anger to fear.

Fear of the layers of killing arrays Xu Yunfan had laid down.

Han Shi repeatedly deduced in his heart: if he were in the place of that Qiu Dragon, facing Xu Yunfan’s layer upon layer of array formations, would he have any chance of survival?

The answer was despairing. Absolutely not.

The way of formations is to leverage the power of the heavens with trivial strength, turning it into a crushing blow.

Furthermore, Xu Yunfan was well-versed in both formations and artifacts. The array he had laid down now was a thunder killing array of unparalleled power, its offensive sharpness not inferior to that of a top-tier sword cultivator.

To use formation techniques at the Golden Core level—which sword cultivator would dare claim they could charge into such a formation unscathed?

Through the connection of the Attribute Panel, Xu Yunfan perceived these thoughts clearly.

But Xu Yunfan didn't care in the slightest.

If Han Shi made any sudden moves, Xu Yunfan could take over his body and soul with a single thought, leaving him no room to cause trouble.

Right now, the most important thing was to command Han Shi to complete the ultimate array for hunting the Dao Fruit.

Xu Yunfan’s thoughts flowed, and he continuously transmitted artifact array flags through the Attribute Panel.

Han Shi, far away in the Underworld Earth, immediately received the instructions.

Han Shi, his face expressionless, took out array flags and array disc hubs from his storage artifact.

These artifact-level array flags were all meticulously refined by Xu Yunfan over the past three years. He utilized the gaps between exploring the Sea of Bitterness, combined with the secret formation manuals of the Primordial Origin Sect and his own profound understanding of space and Yin killing qi.

First, Han Shi thrust the *Shadow Phantom Flags*—which specialized in concealment, deception, and briefly disrupting space—into the void.

Guided by Xu Yunfan’s precise spiritual sense, they sank into specific spatial nodes. Like drops of water entering the sea, they instantly merged with the surrounding violent spatial fluctuations and dense Yin killing dead qi, vanishing without a trace.

This was merely the outer layer of cover.

Next came the core of this hunt: the thunder array designed specifically for the attributes of the Taiyin Qiu Dragon’s Dao Fruit.

Xu Yunfan cultivated the *Divine霄 Nine宸 Xuanqiong Immortal True Sutra*, a technique of supreme yang and supreme hardness capable of destroying all laws. However, in the ultimate Yin and ultimate寒 location of the Sea of Bitterness, pure Yang thunder would be greatly suppressed and easily provoke a violent backlash from the laws of the Sea of Bitterness.

With the slightest misstep, a single spark of supreme yang could blow this area apart, causing a commotion that wouldn't be small.

Therefore, Xu Yunfan chose to use the *Divine霄 Purple Mansion Destroyer Heavenly Gang True Thunder Method* as the central core. This method did not directly invoke Yang thunder but was a supreme art for commanding all thunders, particularly adept at驾驭 and transforming various Yin killing thunders.

Under Xu Yunfan’s control, Han Shi carefully inserted the array flags, painted with complex purple-gold thunder patterns, into specific positions around the periphery of the Bone Island.

"Summon the Earth Killing Abyss Thunder!"

Xu Yunfan’s spiritual sense command transmitted clearly.

Han Shi obeyed, thrusting several triangular flags, black as ink as if they could absorb all light, into the crevices of the blood sea rocks.

Once these array flags landed, they faintly connected to the Yin killing turbid qi accumulated in the depths of the Sea of Bitterness for billions of years. Once activated, they would summon pitch-black Yin killing thunder dragons to break out of the sea, specifically targeting the physical body and soul while sealing off retreat routes.

"Next, set up the Nine Nether Yin Killing Thunder Array."

Under another wave of commands.

Following Xu Yunfan’s urging, Han Shi took out several array disc hubs carved with Nine Nether ghost-face talismans and thrust them into spatial nodes.

This array could gather the pervasive Nine Nether Yin qi of the Sea of Bitterness, transforming it into a silent, bone-eroding, soul-destroying Yin killing net that seeped into every nook and cranny.

"Set the Yellow Spring Soul-Attracting Yin Thunder."

Several bone-white array flags were arranged in specific positions.

They could invoke the resentment of the dead souls in the Sea of Bitterness, transforming them into sorrowful wailing soul thunders that directly attacked a living being's soul and disturbed their spiritual intellect.

Xu Yunfan used the *Divine霄 Purple Mansion Destroyer Heavenly Gang True Thunder Method* as the general principle, interlocking and nesting these Yin killing thunder arrays of different attributes and immense power.

Under the command of the Divine霄 True Intent, Yin thunder could transform into Yang, and Yang thunder could transform into Yin killing, creating a cycle of generation and restraint with infinite variations.

Once unleashed, it would be a thunder killing trap capable of destroying heaven and earth.

This composite great array, tailored specifically for the environment of the Sea of Bitterness and integrating various Yin killing thunders, was named by Xu Yunfan the *Nine Nether Soul-Extinguishing Thunder Killing Array*.

This array, where every single formation was nested within another and each was of at least the sixth rank, was extremely difficult to set up. Even with the assistance of the Attribute Panel, Xu Yunfan’s mind was nearly drained.

However, the effect was incredibly surprising.

Yet, Xu Yunfan’s layout did not stop there.

When he had tested with the clone Sun Wukong previously, he naturally knew that the environment of the Underworld Earth was special. His usual method of using the Star Spirit Banner to summon the *周天星斗大阵* (Celestial Starry Sky Great Array) was hindered here by the erosion of turbid killing dead qi, and receiving the power of the stars beyond the heavens was extremely difficult, greatly reducing its power.

The Sea of Bitterness of Samsara is the void where the dead return. What is not lacking here is the endless supply of Yin killing qi, dead qi, and resentment.

"I must absorb the endless Yin killing qi of this domain to forge a supreme killing weapon..."

Xu Yunfan’s thoughts turned, muttering to himself as he pondered.

He used the previously laid *Nine Nether Soul-Extinguishing Thunder Killing Array* as the outer core killing move. Within its inner perimeter, Xu Yunfan began to command Han Shi to arrange the embryonic form of another ultimate array.

The *Myriad Calamity Yin Killing Extermination Sword Array*.

This array did not rely on starlight but specifically absorbed the natural turbid killing qi and boundless killing karma of the Sea of Bitterness as its power source.

Furthermore, it contained Xu Yunfan’s insights into the Way of the Sword. Although these insights originated from Han Shi, the Anger-Slaying Sword Intent was genuine, and besides, wasn't the clone essentially him?

Xu Yunfan felt perfectly justified.

During this period, the angrier Han Shi became, the stronger the Anger-Slaying Sword Intent grew, and Xu Yunfan naturally synchronized his感悟 (comprehension) simultaneously.

His understanding of the Way of the Sword grew increasingly profound.

As for understanding multiple sword intents like the Pure Yang Ancestor, Xu Yunfan hadn't thought about it. It would consume a vast amount of his time. Unless he truly stepped into the mid-Golden Core stage and formed a small celestial cycle, allowing him to catch his breath, he wouldn't have the time to spare for such things.

Right now, he naturally had to find a way to seize the Taiyin Qiu Dragon Dao Fruit.

Under Xu Yunfan’s guidance, Han Shi thrust one by one the dark red sword-shaped array banners, radiating a fierce, bloodthirsty aura, into the blood sea whirlpools and the treacherous lands piled high with bones.

These array banners were like greedy giant mouths, frantically absorbing the surrounding Yin killing dead qi and invisible killing karma. The sword intent was fierce and sharp. Even before fully forming, it caused the nearby Underworld space to twist and warp faintly.
