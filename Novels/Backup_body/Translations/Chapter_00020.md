# Chapter 20: The Master Never Threatened Me With a Knife!  

Outside Daliang City, Bailing Prefecture.  

Chen Youyu was dead. His corpse had been discovered half an hour ago, and his estate was now in chaos, filled with noise and confusion.  

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing, having taken the Five Elements Creation Ointment and thoroughly looted the place, calmly walked out of Daliang City.  

However, the Hanging Bird seemed rather displeased, as things had unfolded very differently from what it had imagined.  

"Before killing him, you set fire to damp grass to create smoke for a sneak attack—that's not the honorable act of a righteous hero!"  

"When you killed him, you should have been cold and detached. Exchanging taunts during the fight ruined the aura of a ruthless assassin!"  

"After killing him, you stabbed him twelve more times—that just lacks class."  

"My original vision for you was to kill him with a single slash, then walk away without looking back—pure elegance!"  

The Hanging Bird sighed. "But what I can't tolerate the most is that you actually looted the place? A true, carefree hero should settle grudges with swift vengeance—kill him and leave! How could you ransack his belongings? A noble man loves wealth but takes it with righteousness—this was just robbery!"  

Li Zhengjing glanced at it and said, "I found a jar of fine wine."  

The Hanging Bird shuddered, then immediately changed its tune. "Looting is absolutely necessary after killing someone! Otherwise, their belongings would fall into unworthy hands—what a waste! A noble man loves wealth but takes it with righteousness—you took his possessions with reason!"  

"Stabbing him twelve times was brilliant! Otherwise, he might not have died properly, and that would've caused endless trouble!"  

"Creating smoke beforehand proves you were well-prepared—truly meticulous planning!"  

"Exchanging insults while killing him vented your frustrations and let him die with clarity—a truly benevolent act!"  

"Little Jing, you did an excellent job. Now, where's the wine?"  

The Hanging Bird blinked eagerly, its eyes gleaming.  

Li Zhengjing tossed the wine jar over and then turned his attention to the spirit stone in his bag.  

"A genuine graded spirit stone—its spiritual energy is pure and abundant, far surpassing inferior-grade stones."  

"Where did that bastard Chen Youyu get such a treasure?"  

"The method to alter my fate through the 'Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi' hasn't fully manifested due to insufficient spiritual energy. If I consume this graded spirit stone, will it be enough?"  

With this thought, while the white bird drank, he casually placed the spirit stone in his mouth.  

The spirit stone dissolved within three breaths.  

His consciousness turned to the golden page, where light flickered.  

**Name:** Li Zhengjing  
**Age:** 17  
**Cultivation:** Inner Qi, Third Layer  
**Techniques:** Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Art, Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi, Five Thunder Mountain-Splitting Saber, Basic Body Tempering Fist  
**Public Identity:** Inner Disciple of the Ancient Moon Peak, Feather Transformation Immortal Sect  
**True Identity:** Second Son of Marquis Jian'an  
**Hidden Identity:** Thirteenth Spare Vessel of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord  
**Fate:** Cultivating the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi, the sword energy is too sharp, piercing through the body, riddling it with holes, rupturing organs, and disfiguring the face! Afterward, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord is enraged, dismembers the body, grinds the bones to dust—death without a whole corpse!  
**Fate-Altering Method:** ...  

"The golden page now displays more detailed information."  

Li Zhengjing's heart stirred, but the "Fate-Altering Method" section flickered briefly before returning to its original state.  

There still wasn't enough spiritual energy!  

Even a genuine graded spirit stone was insufficient to fully manifest the fate-altering method!  

Perhaps the "perfected" version of the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi was simply too profound.  

Just as he was about to despair, he suddenly sensed an extremely pure energy flowing from the golden page—gentle and tranquil.  

He froze momentarily as the spiritual energy spread throughout his body.  

He immediately activated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Art, guiding the energy to nourish his organs and heal lingering minor injuries.  

The remaining energy, refined continuously, transformed into inner qi, endlessly replenishing him!  

In an instant, his inner qi surged, rising rapidly!  

He was stunned, then ecstatic. "Can I use the golden page to refine spirit stones for my own cultivation?"  

Under normal circumstances, refining spirit stones to absorb their energy required at least the True Qi realm!  

Only in the True Qi realm, with opened meridians, could one release True Qi to refine external spirit stones.  

True Qi would extract the spiritual energy, encase it, and guide it back into the body through the meridians, refining it to enhance cultivation!  

Yet here he was, refining a spirit stone at the Inner Qi realm, absorbing its energy to boost his cultivation!  

"If this is the case, with enough spirit stones in the 'Inner Qi' realm..."  

Li Zhengjing was exhilarated. "Wouldn't my cultivation speed be a hundred times faster than normal?"  

His emotions surged, but he quickly calmed himself.  

Graded spirit stones were incredibly rare!  

Even as an inner disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, obtaining one was nearly impossible!  

The sect strictly controlled such resources!  

Chen Youyu had planned to use this stone as leverage to bribe an elder for a chance to return to the sect—proof of how precious these stones were even to True Qi realm elders!  

"For an 'Inner Qi' realm cultivator, graded spirit stones are truly a stroke of luck."  

"That dead bastard Chen Youyu had quite the fortune, but now it's mine!"  

"As for spirit stones, I'll find another way!"  

With that thought, he turned to the Hanging Bird. "Senior Brother Hanging, we've rested enough. My strength has mostly recovered. We should set off—we must reach Qixing Prefecture before sunset!"  

The Hanging Bird took two more big gulps of wine before reluctantly sealing the jar and handing it to Li Zhengjing, instructing him to handle it carefully and not break it on the road.  

Li Zhengjing sighed but complied, placing the sack aside and carefully arranging the contents of his bag.  

But as the sack touched the ground, two roots suddenly extended from within, burrowing into the soil and greedily absorbing nutrients!  

"What the hell is this?"  

The Hanging Bird was startled!  

Li Zhengjing's heart sank!  

Two more roots burst through the sack, waving in the air like arms, emitting sounds that resembled pleading cries.  

"Master, forgive me! Your grandson has been trapped in this sack for nearly a full day and night without water or soil—I was about to wither to death!"  

Hearing it speak, the Hanging Bird was even more astonished. It slashed forward with a claw, tearing open the sack!  

Li Zhengjing felt his throat go dry. There was no hiding it now—this was a headache.  

The Hanging Bird leaned in, scrutinizing the contents, and muttered, "Why is it half a tree? And it's a tree spirit? Wait... why does this half-tree look so familiar?"  

"Familiar my ass!"  

The half-tree recognized the bird immediately and angrily waved its roots. "You damned bird! For three years, I gathered spiritual energy to help you cultivate the Blazing Fire Divine Art, and you set me on fire! My devotion was wasted on you—better fed to a dog!"  

"The Five Elements Creation Tree?"  

The Hanging Bird trembled, its eyes lighting up with joy.  

It had been severely punished for losing the Five Elements Creation Tree!  

If it could recover the tree, wouldn't that offset its crime?  

It was overjoyed—until it noticed the tree was only half intact. Its heart sank.  

This tree wouldn't regrow its five branches for at least thirty years, let alone bear Five Elements fruits!  

In other words, for the next few decades, the Five Elements Creation Tree couldn't be used to refine the Creation Five Mystic Pill!  

For the sect, this was still a massive loss—no chance of offsetting its crime!  

Worse, it was also guilty of fleeing. If it returned now, wouldn't that compound its punishment?  

Utterly dejected, it hung its head, enduring the tree's insults.  

But then it realized something and turned to Li Zhengjing.  

"Why do you have the Five Elements Creation Tree?"  

"Wait! The wine you gave me earlier is the same as the one I drank before my crime!"  

"Was it you who framed me?"  

The Hanging Bird erupted in fury, spreading its wings and spewing flames!  

Li Zhengjing raised his saber to block, but the flames were too fierce.  

Faced with the White Luan Divine Bird's innate ability, he had no choice but to channel all his inner qi to protect his organs, chest, and throat.  

With the last shred of qi, he condensed the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi!  

Then, charging through the flames, he opened his mouth—  

The sword qi pierced through the fire, slicing through the air!  

...  

Half an hour later.  

Li Zhengjing drank half a bowl of Five Elements Creation Ointment, healing his injured organs once again.  

He sighed, rubbing his temples. "Every time I use this sword qi, it damages my organs. Without this ointment, I'd have died countless times by now."  

Before him stood a majestic white bird—now bald beneath its belly, its feathers gone.  

"Master, the truth is, you were just kindly offering me wine back then. As for the Five Elements Creation Tree going missing, it was entirely my fault for starting the fire—it had nothing to do with you."  

The Hanging Bird spoke solemnly, its tone grave. "Now we can confirm that this stupid tree crawled into your sack on its own and chose to follow you willingly!"  

It raised a wing, declaring, "No matter how you look at it, this isn't your fault! Even if the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect finds out, we're in the right!"  

"Birdie's absolutely right!"  

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots excitedly. "I came willingly! The master never threatened me with a knife!"
