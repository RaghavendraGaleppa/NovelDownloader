# Chapter 27: Divine Abilities and Cultivation Methods

After obtaining the two jade slips and having completed all his tasks for the day, Chu Ning immediately returned to his room to examine them.

These jade slips were commonly used by immortal sects to store various written records. Typically, the original texts were kept by the sect, while copies for disciples to take outside were inscribed on jade slips. Of course, these slips were registered with the sect, so Zhuang Yunde had specifically warned Chu Ning not to lose them.

Although Chu Ning was most eager to learn about the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, upon noticing that the jade slip detailing body-refining techniques contained less information, he decided to examine that one first.

After reading for only a short while, Chu Ning's expression grew somewhat complicated. The content not only provided a detailed introduction to the path of body refinement but also included comprehensive information about the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art.

The rise and fall of body refinement aligned exactly with what Zhuang Yunde had explained the previous day. The Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art was indeed hailed as the greatest body-refining method throughout history. According to the jade slip, it consisted of three volumes, each divided into different sections.

The first volume contained five sections, corresponding to what Chu Ning had previously seen: Immortal Skin, Unbreakable Bones, Indestructible Tendons, Eternal Soul, and Undying Golden Body. Ancient records indicated that each section of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art came with a divine ability technique. For instance, mastering Immortal Skin would allow one to easily cultivate a divine ability called "Heavenly Fist," transforming it into an innate divine power.

The reason for Chu Ning's complex expression was that while his copy of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art included the cultivation methods for all five sections of the first volume, none of them mentioned these divine abilities.

"It seems these divine abilities were likely lost during transmission," Chu Ning sighed, feeling a pang of regret. "I wonder if there's any chance of recovering them."

Shaking his head, he continued reading. What particularly intrigued him was that the jade slip subsequently compared the stages of body refinement to current cultivation realms.

Mastering Immortal Skin would allow one's body to withstand ordinary spells from cultivators below the peak of mid-stage Qi Refining. Achieving the Undying Golden Body and channeling spiritual power could even enable one to resist spells from late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.

However, progress in the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art was significantly slower than conventional cultivation methods. Reaching the Undying Golden Body level typically took more than twice the time required to reach late-stage Foundation Establishment.

Moreover, each stage presented significant bottlenecks. Without obtaining rare treasures that enhanced the physical body, breakthroughs were nearly impossible. In ancient times, such treasures were abundant and easier to find since alchemy techniques hadn't yet been developed. Now, with the increasing number of cultivators and these treasures being highly sought-after ingredients for high-grade elixirs, they were exceedingly rare.

After all, when combined with other ingredients to refine pills, these treasures provided greater benefits to Qi Refinement cultivators. Even if someone obtained them, they were reluctant to consume them directly. Thus, fewer and fewer people practiced the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art.

The jade slip also recorded some ancient treasures that could help overcome bottlenecks in the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art. To Chu Ning's great surprise, one of them was familiar—the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit!

Moreover, the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit was remarkably effective. According to the jade slip, it could even aid in breaking through bottlenecks for stages like Indestructible Tendons and Eternal Soul.

After finishing the entire jade slip, Chu Ning's emotions were in turmoil. First, he hadn't expected the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art to include divine abilities. Second, the cultivation process was far more challenging than he'd anticipated. Merely mastering the first section, Immortal Skin, was comparable to reaching the peak of mid-stage Qi Refining.

Yet, while his progress in the Green Wood Eternal Spring Art was boosted by his Yin Wood Spiritual Body and the technique itself, he hadn't discovered any similar advantages for the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art.

The second surprise was that the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit was an exceptional treasure for strengthening the physical body, even effective for breaking through bottlenecks in the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art. This led Chu Ning to wonder if the bearded man had known about this. Had he also intended to cultivate the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art and sought the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit for this purpose? Perhaps he had targeted Chu Ning after learning of his involvement in Old Man Sun's Seven-Star Spirit Fruit cultivation, inadvertently leading Chu Ning to obtain both the technique and the seeds.

Soon, Chu Ning dismissed these thoughts. The bearded man's motives no longer mattered—what was important was that both items were now in his possession. Although the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art he had was incomplete, missing the divine abilities, he had no intention of abandoning it. The fact that it generated proficiency prompts through his golden finger only strengthened his resolve.

Next, Chu Ning turned his attention to the second jade slip. Its content was far more extensive, taking him over two hours to read through completely. By the end, a smile had appeared on his face.

"This not only introduces various rare spiritual herbs and plants but even includes cultivation methods for some of them. What a treasure!"

What delighted Chu Ning most was the inclusion of cultivation methods for the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit. The fruit's growth cycle was unique—while most spiritual herbs accumulated more spiritual energy and efficacy over time, the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit's entire growth period lasted only a few months. The key to achieving high quality lay in ensuring its survival during this period while maximizing its absorption of spiritual energy.

The jade slip detailed one of the best cultivation methods for the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit. While this method might pose challenges for someone like Old Man Sun, Chu Ning found it manageable. Normally, cultivating the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit required numerous stringent conditions at considerable cost. But for disciples of the Green Stream Sect, there was a shortcut—the Green Wood Spring Technique.

If one could achieve instant casting proficiency with the Green Wood Spring Technique and apply it daily to the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit seedlings for a hundred consecutive days after planting, the seedlings would survive normally. Afterward, the technique could be used to continuously enhance their quality.

For Chu Ning, the only remaining task was to master the Green Wood Spring Technique to the point of instant casting. Having already achieved this with the Wood Awakening Technique and the Purification Technique, he felt confident that this goal wasn't far out of reach.
