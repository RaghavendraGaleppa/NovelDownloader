# Chapter 191: Upgrade Complete!

Even at this moment, if someone could peer into Zhou Tian's flesh and blood, they would find his cells intensely dividing, then reorganizing, undergoing an astonishing transformation. Even his physique was changing; his body was expelling some viscous fluids as his metabolism rapidly processed and refined out impurities, even shedding a layer of old skin.

The earth, shattered by the aftershocks of battle, was recovering. Forests grew, ancient trees became robust, like old dragons reborn with vitality, sprouting green buds, blooming sparse flowers, and surging with essence energy. Just a few scattered wisps of aura were enough to create such a profound change in the land.

Data records refreshed on the Immortal System's log page:

"Ultra-high-grade energy detected, meeting upgrade requirements."

"Absorbing... 1%..."

At this moment, Zhou Tian felt a profound sense of ease. As his eyes opened and closed, special beams of light faintly emerged from his golden pupils, making his divine eyes like lightning. The vitality of his flesh and blood continued to strengthen. His physique was completely different; no longer the ordinary mortal body with blocked apertures. Golden radiance bloomed around him, his entire body growing brighter, as if cast from gold, like a divine being.

In this area, numerous murky gray vortices appeared around Zhou Tian's body, but golden symbols shimmered within them. He was like a bottomless pit, furiously absorbing creation-grade substances. Zhou Tian felt a certain change in his physical body, an unknown substance circulating within him. Having used the Cultivation Copying skill multiple times before, he instantly realized: this was spiritual energy. But this time was different from before; this wasn't power gained through a skill, but truly his own. His strength was continuously increasing, and tiny divine glows were condensing within his body.

The gray vortices around Zhou Tian's body linked up, dense and astonishingly effective. Then, several strands of golden rune tassels shot out from Zhou Tian's body, soaring towards the sky.

In the southeastern direction, the Spiritual Ape with Penetrating Arms strode upon mountains, each step covering ten thousand li, with cracks several feet wide appearing beneath his feet. He held a ball of multi-colored substance in his left hand, his heart pounding with excitement, his chest heaving, and crimson gas, like flames, spewing from his nostrils. Bluntly speaking, even though his race was considered a major clan in the Star Realm, this mass of World Origin was still an immense stroke of luck for him. He knew his limits, plundering only a small portion. The other few individuals did the same, leaving much for the Dao Lords so they wouldn't relentlessly pursue them.

However, at this moment, a golden light shot across the sky with extreme speed. The Spiritual Ape's pupils constricted; he thought it was some kind of divine ability and could only barely react, but the golden light struck the World Origin in his hand.

Buzz!

The World Origin hummed, and strands of Dao rhythm were siphoned away by the golden light, right before the Spiritual Ape's stunned eyes. The Spiritual Ape's crimson eyes emitted golden light. Using his innate ocular ability, he saw that the golden light originated from Zhou Tian. His breathing grew heavy; blocking someone's path to fortune was akin to murdering their parents. What's more, this World Origin was already in his hand, and it was being forcibly snatched away. If the golden light's owner had appeared in person, it might have been acceptable, but to plunder with just a single golden light? It was simply looking down on him.

"Roar!"

He roared towards the sky, a strand of purple-gold fur appearing behind his head. An ancient divine-demon-like purple-gold giant ape manifested, wielding a crimson-gold intertwined bronze staff, and fiercely swung it towards the golden light pillar.

Boom!

Spatial ripples spread out, but the golden light pillar was completely unharmed. Instead, the Spiritual Ape with Penetrating Arms was sent flying backward by the aftershocks.

"Fine, you're ruthless!" The Spiritual Ape lay there, staring at the golden light pillar for a long time, then smashed a mountain into smithereens and growled fiercely.

Similar events were happening in several other directions. The Four Dragons of Heavenly Evolution, the Spear-wielding Heavenly King, and the Heavenly King who produced golden paper all stared blankly. They found they couldn't stop it; Zhou Tian was absorbing the World Origin through this golden light pillar, the entire process seamless, as if the two were naturally connected!

Huang Qi was also somewhat shocked. This was unimaginable; how could an individual creature directly absorb the vast information contained within the World Origin?

Zhou Tian felt his cultivation rapidly increasing, skipping low-level realms entirely.

Boom!
Boom!
Boom!

Three booming sounds resonated in his mind, but instead of discomfort, he felt a profound sense of ease. It was as if a gateway had opened within his body, allowing his physique to continue strengthening!

Three Stores Realm! This term appeared in his mind, but...

"Where are my divine abilities? Where are my divine abilities? Where did they go?" Zhou Tian was full of questions. Wasn't the Three Stores Realm supposed to grant three divine abilities? Why didn't he feel that profound, abstruse sensation? Who ate his divine abilities?

The transformation continued. The World Origin had visibly shrunk, and soon Zhou Tian felt his body reaching another bottleneck. Much of the escaping energy lingered within his body but couldn't make him stronger. Eventually, it was absorbed by a certain part of his body.

Enlightenment struck, and Zhou Tian opened his eyes and shouted, "Holy Demon, a cultivation method! Top-tier!"

The Holy Demon paused at his words, but didn't hesitate. He pulled out a golden-glowing jade slip and tossed it towards Zhou Tian. Yuan Chi tried to intervene but was stopped by the Holy Demon. Yuan Chi now had two extra holes on his body; they were evenly matched.

Zhou Tian caught the jade slip and pressed it to his forehead. Profound information flooded his mind. The World Origin's Dao rhythm enveloped him, and he rapidly comprehended it, his expression turning strange as he began forming hand seals. Strands of golden radiance converged behind him, and a blurry, golden-glowing phantom appeared, sitting cross-legged in the void.

"Dharma Idol!?" Yuan Chi's eyes bulged, and he cried out in disbelief. This was an unfamiliar term. In his clan, newborn infants possessed the strength of Saints, yet the man he had just fiercely fought was actually condensing a Dharma Idol, leaving his mind bewildered.

Huang Qi was also confused, his worldview slightly crumbling. A Dao Lord condensing a Dharma Idol?

The phantom quickly solidified into a tangible form: a Buddha sitting cross-legged in the void, smiling, and to everyone's speechless surprise, it bore Zhou Tian's face. The Buddha rapidly grew, and Buddhist charm permeated the air.

The World Origin had almost vanished, and the golden light pillars shooting from Zhou Tian's body also disappeared. Only the largest mass beside Zhou Tian had a trace remaining.

Zhou Tian, immersed in his rapid advancement, suddenly had an inexplicable feeling. He opened the Immortal System; the interface was largely unchanged, but the last line of data in the log was sparkling:

"System upgrade complete. Host level increased, one skill point gained, revive count increased by one. Please experience further changes yourself."

Zhou Tian's brow raised. Sure enough, his revive count had increased, which was within his predictions. The Host directly leveled up and gained a skill point – that was an unexpected bonus. And that last phrase, "further changes," filled Zhou Tian with a bit more anticipation.
