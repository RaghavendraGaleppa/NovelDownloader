# Chapter 202: Pretty Boy

“Sir, three sets of Wutian's exuviae are approaching this location. Please retrieve them as soon as possible.” Huang Qi stepped forward, lowering his head slightly. This person was clearly a high-ranking member of the Border Prison, and inextricably linked to the Burial Scroll. His very human-skin manifestation was the best proof.

“There are still three sets left? Wutian's research into the Burial Scroll must be catching up to mine,” the man, a manifestation of human skin, remarked with a hint of surprise, as if he hadn't expected three sets of exuviae to still be here. He then slightly furrowed his brow and looked at Huang Qi. “I need to collect the Burial Scroll, so I cannot act. Can you hold them off?”

Huang Qi nodded. “Sir, these two friends from Kyushu, along with Wutian's disciple, might be able to handle it.”

The human-skin man turned his gaze to Zhou Tian and the two others. Runes seemed to float and sink in his eyes as he spoke, “If that's the case, then I thank the three of you. After this is done, my Border Prison will certainly reward you handsomely.” This man's status in the Border Prison seemed quite high, even capable of representing the entire Border Prison in certain declarations.

“I am but a dead being. I only hope that no one will disturb my master's quiet resting place in the future,” Puzhi sighed and spoke, his eyes a little dazed. The Border Prison's foundation was too strong. This person hadn't appeared at all during the great war back then, perhaps because the Burial Scroll, if controlled by someone else, would have affected him. And after Wutian's death, the Burial Scroll had remained here. It was clear that this person was the owner of the Burial Scroll from countless ages past. Countless years had passed since Wutian's passing, let alone the time before that when this person acquired the Burial Scroll. It was hard to imagine how many years he had existed; he was practically a living fossil. Back then, Wutian hadn't delved deeper into the Star Realm or gained much understanding of the Border Prison. Otherwise, he would never have confronted them head-on.

“Naturally. I only came for the Burial Scroll,” the human-skin man nodded in agreement.

“Senior, approximately how long will it take you to retrieve the Burial Scroll?” Zhou Tian asked.

The human-skin man looked at Zhou Tian, not underestimating him because of his manifested Dharma Aspect Realm cultivation. This was because Huang Qi's earlier mention of “two friends from Kyushu” clearly included Zhou Tian. This indicated that Zhou Tian was not as simple as he appeared.

“I cannot determine the exact time. The Burial Scroll has been incubating here for countless years, absorbing the vital blood of many strong cultivators. Although I have special methods, it's hard to say,” the human-skin man said finally, his gaze towards the Burial Scroll filled with anticipation. This was one of the few emotional fluctuations he had shown in countless ages. “However, I will do my best, and it won't take longer than three *shichen* at most.”

“Alright, I'm going to begin.” As the last drop of blood from the crimson gourd entered the human-skin man's body, his form trembled slightly, and endless golden runes flowed beneath his skin. He slowly stepped into the central plaza. Puzhi formed several hand seals, and the black stone tablets, already activated by the Burial Scroll, rumbled and moved, opening a path and not treating the human-skin man as a target for attack.

As he stepped into the central plaza, the Burial Scroll, which had been suppressed by the black stone tablets, suddenly erupted. An endless river of blood boiled, surging skyward. The Burial Scroll trembled, crimson runes poured out, and horrifying wails seemed to echo in the void, in the most ancient and evil language. The black stone tablets glowed once more, their nearly obliterated patterns faded further. The sound was blocked, not allowed to transmit outwards. The first page of the Burial Scroll flipped open, and endless crimson runes surged out, forming blood-colored chains that coiled around the human-skin man.

The human-skin man made no attempt to block. Innumerable golden runes appeared on his body, forming a shield. The blood-colored rune chains struck it, and the runes endlessly annihilated and regenerated, unable to harm the golden shield.

“Burial Scroll, I know you have powerful control over these exuviae, so how could I not be wary?” The human-skin man laughed loudly, then sat cross-legged beneath the Burial Scroll, closed his eyes, and his lips moved subtly. Runes leaped forth, fearless of the crimson symbols' obstruction, and entered the Burial Scroll. The Burial Scroll seemed enraged. Crimson tornadoes churned on the river of blood, and columns of blood surged forth, engulfing the human-skin man. The black stone tablets glowed even brighter, and several massive divine tablet phantoms descended.

Strange, distinct patterns appeared on the divine tablet phantoms. High above, dark clouds gathered, heavy rain poured down, and gigantic lightning bolts tore through the void. On the earth, mountains collapsed, the surface cracked and sank, magma surged, and the entire land trembled violently. In the oceans, tsunamis crashed repeatedly, enormous waves pounded the shores, towering swells threatened to sweep across the world. They were almost complete worlds.

Outside, several people watched the scene within the central plaza.

“Huang Qi, who is that...?” Zhou Tian asked. “This fellow seems rather imposing. Could he be one of the Prison Lords?”

“That is an ancient powerhouse of my Border Prison, with an incredibly high seniority. Even the Prison Lords refer to him as 'Senior.' If I hadn't been chosen to execute this mission, I wouldn't even know of this esteemed figure's existence,” Huang Qi said, a look of reverence in his eyes.

“How impressive, how impressive,” Zhou Tian casually uttered a couple of perfunctory remarks, then turned to Puzhi and asked, “Master, can you observe where those sets of exuviae have reached?” Zhou Tian remembered Puzhi saying he had special means to monitor the scenes within this space.

Puzhi shook his head. “No, I cannot. They are the exuviae shed by my master. In some ways, they are still a part of my master. This space was opened by my master, and while I can use some methods to observe outsiders like yourselves, I cannot observe them.”

“Alright then,” Zhou Tian felt a little disappointed. He had thought he could anticipate the enemy from a thousand miles away and make some preparations in advance. It seemed he would have to adapt on the fly.

Bang! Just then, a loud bang echoed from the direction of the ancient city gates, and a massive Yin-Yang Diagram slowly rose, like a canopy covering the sky, with some profound mystery flowing within it.

“Heaven's Evolution Four Dragons?” Zhou Tian recognized this divine ability; it was the Heaven's Evolution Four Dragons, and they had even used it to fight against Shengmo. “Didn't expect them to actually dare come here. Aren't they afraid of death?” Zhou Tian sneered, remembering clearly that these people had attacked both him and Shengmo.

Shengmo and Huang Qi both gave Zhou Tian a strange look. If he hadn't stolen the very origin of their world, they would have long since found a corner to hide in.

Boom! With a loud bang, the Yin-Yang Diagram shattered, transforming into streaks of light that vanished between heaven and earth.

“Master, is there any way for us to see the scene they're in?” Zhou Tian's mind stirred, and he spoke. Because this place was full of skeletal warriors and useless human skins, the Heaven's Evolution Four Dragons' Yin-Yang Diagram was still somewhat effective against common foes, but an entity capable of shattering it with a single blow was likely not a creature from within this city.
