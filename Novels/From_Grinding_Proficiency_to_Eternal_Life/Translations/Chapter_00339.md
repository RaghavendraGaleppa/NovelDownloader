# Chapter 339: Maitreya Monastery

The technique was the "Nailing the Dragon Art," an ancient forbidden术 passed down within the Dao Sect. It had become completely useless as the spiritual energy of heaven and earth faded, but now that it was being used again, it displayed a grandeur befitting two thousand years of history.

With every dragon nailed, Bi Yuan's face turned a shade paler, while Xu Yunfan's physical body, hundreds of miles away, shimmered with a mysterious yellow luster as his Ten Extreme True Qi surged violently.

Just as Bi Yuan reached the critical moment, Buddhist chants suddenly echoed up the mountain path.

Three high monks from Maitreya Monastery stepped through the air and arrived. Surrounded by True Qi, lotus blossoms of light manifested beneath their feet, blooming one after another.

Bi Yuan turned his head to look, his eyebrows slightly raising.

Three Ninth Realm supreme grandmasters.

"The bald donkeys from Maitreya Monastery..."

Not far away, the long-browed Taoist seated in meditation on a stone platform stirred slightly, his expression filled with surprise.

"Have these monks become so arrogant after just a hundred years?"

The three high monks of Maitreya Monastery landed atop the summit of Clear Weave Mountain.

The lead monk, Ciku, had a face as withered as dead wood, a red flesh tumor at the center of his brows, wore a splendid brocade kasaya, and held an Eight Treasure Purple Gold Zen Staff.

The monk to his left, Cinan, was as burly as a bear, wearing a necklace of one hundred and eight human skull prayer beads, each engraved with blood-cursed "swastika" characters.

True Qi of Vajra floated around him with every breath, causing the bronze lamps at the edge of the ritual platform to hum and vibrate.

The monk to his right, Cie, was a dwarf's body yet carried a Demon-Subduing Pestle taller than himself.

The "Sarira" embedded in the pestle's head burst with blinding Buddhist light, causing the runes on the ritual platform to show signs of melting.

"Master Bi!"

Ciku's voice was like a great temple bell. "You Dao Sect forcibly siphon the Great Zhou's Dragon Vein, causing earthquakes and landslides in the northwest and displacing the people. How can you commit such an act against the heavens without fearing retribution?"

Before the words fully faded, the three simultaneously formed the "Vajra Demon-Subduing Seal," and Sanskrit characters transformed into golden chains that wrapped toward the Kan-Li Cauldron.

Bi Yuan sneered. Borrowing the power accumulated by the ritual platform, he drew a brilliant sword light with his peach wood sword, forcing the chains back. "Earthquakes in the three northwestern states? I'm afraid it was your Maitreya Monastery digging up 'Ancient Buddha Remains' that collapsed the underground palace, wasn't it?"

His sword tip suddenly turned toward Cie. "The sarira on that Demon-Subduing Pestle... doesn't it look like it was refined from a skull using my Dao Sect's 'Jade Pillow Locking Essence' technique?"

While the two sides seemed to be trading verbal blows, they had already employed secret martial arts.

Three of the bone prayer beads on Cinan's necklace cracked open silently, flying out "several strands of black qi" that钻入 the earth veins, attempting to cut off the输送 of the mysterious yellow energy.

A bronze compass in Bi Yuan's sleeve suddenly reversed. The "Greedy Wolf Star" on the disk lit up, triggering the "Seven Kill Evil-Exterminating Array" buried at the summit, shredding the strands of black qi.

Bi Yuan frowned. These monks had come and immediately launched covert attacks to sabotage things; it was truly infuriating.

He was just about to let go of his peach wood sword and roll up his sleeves to step forward when...

Three tolls of a bell suddenly came from deep within Clear Weave Mountain.

A sword qi shot up from Heavenly Sword Peak, cleaving a trench more than ten miles long through the clouds. An old man in hemp clothes came wielding a sword—it was the Dao Sect's Sword Lineage Grand Elder, "Ling Xiaozi." The long sword in his hand was the "Broken Edge," which had once beheaded the Abbot of Maitreya Monastery. As the light shimmered on the blade, it vaguely possessed the aura of an Eighth Rank divine weapon.

As the sword qi弥漫, a fine crack suddenly appeared on the purple gold bowl in Ciku's hand. He was horrified to discover that his "Vajra Indestructible Body," which he had painstakingly cultivated for a hundred years, was being pricked by an invisible sword intent, causing a dull pain.

"Ling Xiaozi?! You aren't dead yet?"

Ling Xiaozi snorted coldly. "You lot are all living like turtles hiding in their shells, how could I possibly go into the grave?"

"Amitabha..."

Ciku gritted his teeth and put away his staff. "Since the Dao Sect friends are busy, this poor monk shall discuss the Dharma with you another day."

"What a pointless visit..."

Watching the three monks—Ciku, Cinan, and Cie—leave swiftly, the old man in hemp clothes snorted coldly, merely stroking the sword in his hand with a hint of regret.

"My sword hasn't been unsheathed to taste blood for decades."

If a Ninth Realm Qi Refining supreme grandmaster truly intends to leave, it is very difficult to stop them.

Moreover, the Dao Sect was at a critical moment right now. The monks of Maitreya Monastery wouldn't launch an attack without preparation. If they forcefully tried to keep them, it might give Maitreya Monastery an opening to exploit.

Bi Yuan's face was as dark as water as he said, "Those three were likely here to test us, to probe just how far we've come."

As dusk settled, three figures draped in the lingering sunlight stopped beneath a withered willow by the roadside.

The cracks on the staff in Ciku's hand seeped丝丝 black qi, turning the withered grass beneath his feet gray and white. He stroked the fissure cut by the invisible sword intent, cold sweat seeping from his bitter melon-like wrinkles. "The Dao Sect was actually able to忍下 such provocation. That old Taoist Bi Yuan was clearly suffering backlash from the Nailing the Dragon Art, yet he'd rather折损 his lifespan than reveal a flaw."

"I say we should just gather the Eighteen Arhats Array and storm Clear Weave Mountain!"

Cinan snapped three bone beads from his necklace, clearing out the honeycomb-like holes eaten away by the black qi. "The Grand Rite of the Heavens siphons the foundation of the Great Zhou's Dragon Vein accumulated over three hundred years. If the Dao Sect can eat from it, why can't Maitreya Monastery?"

"Mind your words!"

Cie suddenly whispered.

A flock of cold crows startled from the treetops.

Seven shadows appeared from the darkness like paper ash. The leader was an old eunuch with a face as white as jade and no beard, but with a crimson blood seal刺在 his forehead. His nails were as black as hooks as they twirled around the Demon-Subduing Pestle in Cie's hand. "Three Great Masters, what a temper... Have you forgotten the Emperor's instructions?"

"Grand Eunuch Cui."

Ciku joined his palms in a salute. "Has the 'Soul-Butchering Blade of Yin' that His Majesty promised to lend arrived?"

Behind the old eunuch Cui Yu, a hunchbacked eunuch stepped forward, undoing a yellow cloth bundle from his back.

When it was unwrapped, a pitch-black single-edged blade was presented before everyone.

The hunchbacked eunuch laughed sinisterly. "This is a divine weapon forged by the previous dynasty to 'cut down mountains and destroy temples,' specifically designed to break the Dao Sect's True Qi. Unfortunately, before it could be used, our Great Zhou perished it..."

"It's not enough."

Cie suddenly interrupted. "That monster Ling Xiaozi has already reached the 'Sword Qi Manifestation' realm. Unless you bring out that Buddha Corpse from the Imperial Tomb."

"Mind your words!"

Cui Yu's expression remained calm. "His Majesty can tacitly allow you to share the Dragon Vein's mysterious yellow energy, but regarding this Buddha Corpse... the sincerity you've offered is insufficient!"

The sound of chains dragging across the ground came from behind the withered willow.

A burly man wearing a bronze mask walked out of the shadows, seven tiger tally medals hanging from his waist jingling. It was Yan Tieshan, the commander of the Northern Command's Six Armies, in charge of the Jiannan Circuit. He kicked away a little eunuch blocking his path, causing the hunchbacked eunuch beside him to flash with cold light in his eyes.

Now that Great Zhou had retreated to the Yujing Circuit, these men were gradually becoming lawless. To borrow their strength, Cui Yu had to endure it.

Yan Tieshan ignored them, slamming a rolled sheepskin map into Ciku's chest. "Thirty miles northwest of Clear Weave Mountain is an abandoned mine, called 'Xuanming Eye' by the previous dynasty. I had the grave robbers from Beimang Mountain take a look; there's a Dao Sect earth vein there. If it were to be severed..."

"That place was long ago designated as a forbidden area by the Dao Sect."

Cinan crushed the edge of the map, his face full of difficulty.

"There are definitely Dao Sect experts stationed there."

"This old monk has a plan."

Ciku spoke up. "This brat's True Qi is nearly mixed and flawless, but during the process of the mysterious yellow energy灌注 his body, there must be a moment of stagnation..."

The hunchbacked eunuch suddenly interjected. "The 'Thousand Mechanism Powder' newly developed by the Directorate of Ceremonial Rites was specifically designed to target Ninth Realm Qi Refiners. It can cause a person's True Qi to逆flow for three breaths!"

"Three breaths? That's enough for me to smash his head open! Just let me get on the field then."

(There should be another chapter later, probably... still writing...)
