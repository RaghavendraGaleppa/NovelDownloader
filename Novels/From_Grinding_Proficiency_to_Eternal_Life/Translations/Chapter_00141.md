# Chapter 141: Retreat

The sound of a neck snapping mixed with the bubbling of molten rock.

The少年 whose neck had been twisted still had half a peach-wood talisman hanging from his waist—a protective charm given to him by Fu Jin for his birthday last year.

The third disciple suddenly lunged, teeth aiming for Fu Jin's wrist.

Fu Jin's fingers flicked out. As the disciple's skull shattered, Fu Jin's voice sounded as if squeezed from an iron anvil.

"Zhou Wanniang, only daughter of the embroiderer from Yangzhou's Jincheng in Jiangnan Dao..." He tore open the dead disciple's clothes, revealing a jade pendant hanging askew on the collarbone.

"Her mother entrusted me to take good care of..."

A disciple with his eyes rolled back suddenly spoke with a human voice: "Master... save me..."

Fu Jin's fingers froze in mid-air.

There was a centipede-like scar on this少年's neck—the very mark Fu Jin had personally witnessed being burned into his flesh during ironworking lessons years ago.

"Sun Xiao'yi!"

Fu Jin's eyes nearly burst with fury as his palm came crashing down.

"You damn bastard, you promised to inherit my craft!"

As flames swallowed the plea, the illuminating stones in the ceiling of the Earthfire Chamber suddenly exploded.

Xu Yunfan saw the trail of tears winding down Fu Jin's face.

When they walked out of the Earthfire Chamber, Xu Yunfan stood atop a tall building in the Casting Hall's驻地, quietly overlooking the entire city. The sulfurous stench of incinerated corpses from the chamber was carried by the night wind, mingling with the smell of scorched earth that swept past his nose.

He gazed down at the fragmented remains of Tiangong City. Half the mechanical lanterns on Vermilion Bird Street had gone dark, and fresh bloodstains gleamed like grease in the dim light. The city's mercury pumps had been destroyed, and toxic liquid metal was seeping through underground channels to erode the foundations. Most piercing was the sight of the western blacksmith shop—the door panel he had helped repair just three days prior now impaled with half a corpse.

Far in the distance, Qi Huan was leading Yuan Ze, the chief disciple of the External Affairs Hall, in constant cleanup efforts, his expression despondent, the mechanical sword case in his hand cracked in several places.

Yue Shan's corpse was dragged from the pile of bodies, the great axe in his grip split open, his eyes wide with fury.

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly.

Suddenly, the hum of the Nine-Ring Mountain-Shaking Hammer tore through the deathly silence.

Zhan Yan strode across the field littered with shattered mechanical beasts, his墨色玄铁重甲 bearing a three-foot-long crack on the left shoulder that exposed the鲛皮 lining beneath—just a bit more and his entire arm would have been severed. The originally崭新墨色玄铁重甲 was now deeply scarred by blades and axes.

"Where's Fu Jin?"

Zhan Yan scanned the mournful faces of the Casting Hall disciples in the ranks—less than half remained compared to usual. His expression grew even darker. Of the seventy-two disciples on duty, only thirty-odd remained standing, supporting themselves with broken swords and halberds, half of them wrapped in blood-soaked bandages.

When he turned to see Xu Yunfan approaching, his expression eased slightly.

Xu Yunfan pointed toward the direction of the Earthfire Chamber. Sulfur smoke was billowing from the ventilation shafts, and the muffled roar of churning lava could faintly be heard. "The disciples afflicted with the蚀心蛊... Senior Brother Fu is sending them on their final journey."

Zhan Yan's knuckles whitened as he gripped the hammer handle, saying nothing.

He looked at the deep purple bloodstains on Xu Yunfan's body, yet the young man stood tall and unbowed.

Instead, he said: "Come with me to the city gates?"

Xu Yunfan naturally didn't hesitate in the slightest, nodding in agreement.

"I'll follow your instructions, Master."

On the rapid journey, Zhan Yan remained silent for a long while before finally speaking: "Hall Master Hong was intercepted by the Incense Flame Sect's Marrow Cleansing Grandmaster and couldn't break free. Now that the Tiangong Fortress is complete and the sect's Grandmaster saw the situation was hopeless, they've already withdrawn. I came as quickly as I could."

This was rare—Zhan Yan actually explaining his absence. With half the Casting Hall disciples dead or injured, he naturally felt immense guilt.

Xu Yunfan understood. He knew that if not for Hong Baichuan holding the line, Tiangong Cave would likely have faced total annihilation rather than the current situation where everything had been cleansed.

Outside the玄钢莲城, the Incense Flame Sect's Demon-Suppressing Heavenly Army's blood lotus banners blotted out the sky. Twelve thousand armored warriors stood silently. Before them lay dense craters blasted by cannon fire from the mechanical巨虎's mouth, burying countless sect members.

Beneath the great banner bearing the character "Yan," Yan Ming rode forth in his赤鳞明王铠, the丈二明王枪 dragging along the ground and scattering sparks. "Old Man Wan Chen! How long can your turtle shell hold?"

Hearing Yan Ming's roar, Tiangong Department Hall Master Wan Chen laughed like thunder from atop the lotus city's battlements. Beneath his feet, the rumble of interlocking gears accompanied the slow rotation of the twelve-layered玄钢 lotus petals. His voice rolled across the land like a tidal wave: "Sixty years ago, the Northern Desert Royal Court's hundred thousand cavalry charged the pass, the Yanbei Dao flames of war flickered, and this 'Tiangong Fortress' held for a full hundred days!"

As he spoke, a tremor like that of an ancient behemoth awakening emanated from the lotus city's core. A fifty-zhang tall Mo Family mechanical tiger thrust its head out from a fissure in the mountain, the dragon's breath cannon in its mouth glowing with lava-like red light.

Yan Ming's flood dragon horse reared in terror, but he stabbed his枪 into the ground, using a thousand-jin weight technique to forcibly pin the steed down. His expression was extremely unsightly—just a few shots from that mechanical巨虎 had nearly shattered the entire army's morale. The twelve thousand warriors behind him were all he had managed to gather with great effort.

Wan Chen's strength was formidable. Though his mountain-cleaving巨斧 couldn't match Yan Ming's treasure-grade丈二明王枪, it was simply too thick and heavy. The fight felt stifling. Worse still were the tiger-crouching cannons above—each shot was deafening, like thunderclaps that terrified the soul. Many sect members had even been frightened to death on the spot.

"Stop your sorcery! Once our sect's Great Protector..."

"Retreat."

Two light words drifted from behind the formation.

The Incense Flame Sect's Great Protector stepped over the mountain of corpses, arriving with effortless grace. The pressure from a Marrow Cleansing Grandmaster sent sand and stone flying within a hundred paces.

"Protector大人!!"

Yan Ming quickly bowed. Hearing the Protector's words, though his expression remained unsightly, he inexplicably sighed in relief. When Tiangong City had turned upside down and the玄钢莲 rose from the earth, it had been truly震撼人心.

The powerhouse wearing the bronze ghost mask gazed up at the lotus city, his gaze piercing through the玄钢 lotus petals to peer into its depths. "Hong Baichuan actually touched the threshold of organ refinement... pity, just a bit short." He suddenly swept his sleeve, grabbing Yan Ming and retreating a hundred zhang.

Almost simultaneously, the mechanical tiger's dragon breath cannon roared, thirty-six burning meteoric irons melting the spot where they had stood into a glassy crater. The newly assembled Incense Flame Sect warriors were thrown into chaos, cries and wails rising unceasingly.

"Retreat!"

The voice beneath the ghost mask carried unwillingness. "Once the sect's Venerables make their move, this turtle shell will fall with a flip of the hand!"

Watching the Incense Flame Sect's army retreat like a receding tide, Wan Chen let his巨斧 fall with a thunderous crash. The tightly coiled muscles across his body relaxed like waves, the muscle玄甲 formed by his玄龟驼山劲 dissolving. He turned to see Zhan Yan and Xu Yunfan approaching and grinned.

"Old bastard, you're late."

"Scram!"

Zhan Yan coldly retorted, but watching the retreating Incense Flame Sect, he too felt a sense of relief.

After a long while, he suddenly spoke: "The other seven sects in Cangzhou... I'm afraid they'll have a hard time."
