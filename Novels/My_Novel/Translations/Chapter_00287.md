Chapter 287: The Evil Spirit Knocks, Desperate Straits, Li Xian Saves the Day, The Second Turbid Robe!

The ghostly entity... was mysterious and eerie.

Nangong Liuli looked at the knocking ghost outside the door, and her hair stood on end. She remembered that her third uncle had died at the hands of a ghost for some reason. After his death, he left behind the "Ghost Record," which documented information about the 'Nether River' and 'Ghostly Entities,' involving matters of great magnitude. It had been classified as a secret record of the Nangong family, a family secret.

The Ghost Record stated that ordinary ghosts included "Yang Ghosts," "Corpse Ghosts," and "Child Ghosts"... These types of ghosts possessed physical forms. Yang Ghosts were formed from "tigers and beasts" that were swallowed whole, very lowly and not particularly terrifying. "Corpse Ghosts" and "Child Ghosts" were slightly different but similar. Although their names contained the word "ghost," strictly speaking, they belonged to the category of "monsters."

More powerful ghosts had mysterious origins and causes, which Nangong Liuli did not know. The 'Ghost Record' was something she, as a legitimate daughter, was not qualified to peruse. She felt secretly terrified as the knocking sound grew louder. She felt that her luck was terrible, everything was going wrong, and even ghosts were coming to find her.

She quickly thought of a plan to deal with it. Her family had a profound heritage, but knowledge of ghosts and monsters was rare, and even ordinary clan members did not study it. However, she happened to know a little. At this critical moment, she suppressed her panic and used lightness skill to land on the crown of a fruit tree.

She plucked seven leaves with a sweep of her hand and bit her finger, drawing talisman patterns on the leaves. She did not understand the meaning of the talisman characters, but she vaguely remembered they were related to ghosts. After finishing the drawings on the leaves, she threw them out, nailing them to seven places on the vermilion door.

The knocking sound immediately weakened. But soon it started again. Each time it sounded, a leaf would fall. Nangong Liuli frowned, racking her brains to think of another plan.

Given the current danger, she didn't care if it was true or false. She tried all the strategies she knew for dealing with fierce ghosts. But the effect was minimal. Just as she was thinking of another plan, she suddenly saw the vermilion door become calm.

Nangong Liuli thought to herself: "Did it leave?" She relaxed slightly and looked at the sky. The dark mist seemed to be receding, and the silver moon was gradually revealed. Nangong Liuli patted her chest lightly. Although she didn't understand what had happened, things seemed to be improving. Only then did she realize her entire body was drenched in sweat.

Nangong Liuli suddenly felt terrified. She glanced out and saw that although the dark mist had cleared, the center of the full moon was showing a crimson red. The moonlight, silver with a tinge of red, fell upon the roof tiles. It was extremely quiet, extremely eerie.

Although the vermilion door was still tightly closed, the knocking ghost had already entered the courtyard. Nangong Liuli's sweat dripped down her cheeks, soaking the clothes over her chest. She quickly hid in the hall, closed the hall door, and barred it.

Although her martial arts were not bad, in this situation, she couldn't use them at all. The attack was sudden and without warning. She waited anxiously for a moment, and sure enough, a strange sound came from the hall door.

This time, it was much clearer, separated only by a single door. The chilling aura froze her whole body. She was usually quite calm, but the dire straits she was facing were beyond her ability to resist.

She couldn't help but feel extremely resentful and inexplicably wronged. Why were all these dangers directed at her? Among the countless households on Qingniu Street, why did it have to find the Qingniu Residence?

She suddenly thought: "That's right... I heard Hua Wucuo mention it. The Qingniu Residence has been abandoned for years. Could that be the reason? Oh dear... Cheap things are indeed not worth buying."

Seeing the knocking sound gradually stop, the knocking ghost ceased its movements, and the hall door returned to peace. Nangong Liuli knew the ghost was about to enter the hall. She gathered her courage, saw there was still some undrunk tea in the hall. She squeezed out some essence blood, soaked it into the tea, and dyed the tea red. She pinched the tea between her fingers and drew阵 a on on on on onThis.

The knocking sound continued one after another.

When it finally fell silent, Nangong Liuli looked around and once again saw the ghost's phantom from her surroundings: this time, the ghost stood by the bed, formed by the sheer curtains, moonlight, and dressing table. Nangong Liuli's mind went completely blank, her palms were sweating, and she felt a sense of powerlessness and frustration all over.

With such a ghost demanding her life, she truly had no way to fight back. Just at this moment, there was a "bang" as the door was kicked open heavily. The door cracked and shattered into four pieces, blasted apart by internal energy.

The silver moon in the sky had completely turned red,透着一股妖邪诡异. The red light fell on Li Xian's left face,衬托得满脸凶煞.

Li Xian shouted: "Scram!" This shout was full of killing intent, the vermilion mole on his forehead flashing with red light. His face was flawless,透着一股难言肃穆威严.

Li Xian shouted again: "Get out!" His voice shook the bedroom. The atmosphere in the room gradually changed, the oppressive and chilling aura began to recede, as if hesitating for a moment more and it would fade away like the tide.

Nangong Liuli looked around the room and saw no more ghostly shadows. Overjoyed, she couldn't help but be extremely surprised. Could shouting really scare away ghosts? This ghost didn't even have a physical form, yet it feared being scolded by a living person?

Nangong Liuli, overwhelmed with shock, had no time to think further. Moreover, Li Xian didn't want to show off, so she didn't notice the unusual phenomenon of his dual pupils. Having suddenly undergone such a drastic change, she was temporarily out of danger, but her body was still tense, and she remained seated motionless.

Li Xian went over to help her up and comforted her: "Sister Liuli, are you alright?" Nangong Liuli gratefully said: "I'm... I'm fine." Feeling Li Xian get close, she felt an unparalleled sense of security. Her beautiful eyes flashed with a strange light as she stroked his face and said: "Good brother, sister... sister didn't know you were so formidable."

Li Xian smiled and said: "Didn't you already know my prowess?" Nangong Liuli's pretty face flushed slightly, knowing what Li Xian was referring to. She lightly patted Li Xian's chest and said: "You're so cheeky. I'm not talking about that kind of prowess. Oh dear... I can't explain it clearly to you, bad brother. And at a time like this, you're still having wild thoughts."

Li Xian said: "It's really strange today. Did that evil ghost hurt you?" Nangong Liuli shook her head and said: "If you had come a moment later, I would have been in danger."

She added: "This house has something strange about it."

Li Xian said: "It's my fault... I heard it was haunted, but I didn't take it seriously. We were living just fine before, who knew it would suddenly become haunted so fiercely."

Nangong Liuli said: "There's no help for it. Who made us newcomers with so little money, we could only... afford to rent a haunted house." Thinking of the eeriness she had just experienced, she couldn't help but lean closer to Li Xian and continued:

"You little rascal, you're not being honest at all! Quickly confess, why did that ghost obey your orders? You told it to scram, and it really did?"

Li Xian laughed and said: "A little ghost, what's so powerful about it? Is it that hard to make it get lost?"

Nangong Liuli said in shock: "You... you're so arrogant. That thing is formless and shapeless, you can't hit it or touch it, why would it fear you?"

Li Xian said: "Formless and shapeless?" But he had seen it clearly. When he burst into the room, the ghost shadow was startled and had already curled up in the corner. It didn't seem very powerful; with a loud shout, it fled in a sorry state.

The truth was...

The ghost was by no means formless and shapeless. Nangong Liuli had been blinded by the ghost, hence she had no way to deal with it. The ghost dared not blind Li Xian's dual pupils, so it naturally revealed its true form.

The ghost did indeed exist in this world. Its cause was a mystery, and it couldn't be simply summarized as something formed after death. Li Xian couldn't be bothered to think deeply about it. Seeing the ghost driven away and the courtyard restored to peace, he cautiously decided to patrol the house to see if any ghostly remnants remained.

Nangong Liuli, having been frightened by the ghost, didn't dare to leave Li Xian's side for a moment. The two walked out of the room hand in hand, patrolling from the west wing. Nangong Liuli held Li Xian's hand tightly, her lingering fear not yet gone. Amidst the heart-pounding excitement, she thought of Li Xian just now, feeling an immense sense of security, and her heart was filled with mixed emotions.

Nangong Liuli said: "Bad brother, our house has something strange about it. If we have the chance in the future, we need to find out what it is and put an end to the haunting."

Li Xian said: "Sister Liuli, you're experienced and knowledgeable. Have you ever seen these kinds of things before?" Nangong Liuli glared at him and said: "If I had seen them, would I have been scared half to death?"

Li Xian teased: "Who would have thought Nangong Liuli, the legitimate daughter of a noble family, would be so afraid of ghosts. If Bian Qiaoqiao saw this, wouldn't she laugh at you?"

Nangong Liuli said: "You bad little thief, you're already laughing at me now. Do I need to wait for Sister Bian to laugh?"

After patrolling the area, they saw the dark clouds receding. It had indeed returned to normal. The ghost's presence had completely dispersed, all doors were tightly closed, and there were no external enemies lurking. They returned to the open-air hall and sat down hand in hand.

Nangong Liuli sighed: "I wonder how Sister Bian is doing. Did she end up as fish food, or did she escape?"

Li Xian said: "She should be able to escape." Nangong Liuli felt a slight joy upon hearing this and said: "How can you be so sure? Are you trying to trick me into feeling better?"

Li Xian said: "Why would I trick you? When you two were hanging in the cell, I was on the deck practicing martial arts. We encountered several fishing boats, all filled with fish."

"At the time, Ye Cheng ordered me to call the fishermen onto the ship to buy their fish. If there were fruits, vegetables, or other food on the fishing boats, even dry biscuits and pickled vegetables, we bought them at a high price. After all... everyone had been eating fish for several days. Their mouths were full of fishy smell, so they were extremely happy to have other food."

"When the fishermen came aboard, I went to chat and negotiate with them. The Dongran Lake is vast, with hidden water bandits inside. But it produces abundant fish, shrimp, and crabs, making it extremely wealthy. It's also a treasure land for countless fishermen to make a living."

"The lake area we passed through had many fishermen fishing. If your Sister Bian was diving and escaping in the lake, she might encounter fishermen and get on a fishing boat. Escaping would naturally be no problem. These fishermen have excellent swimming skills and know some clever ways to find their direction."

Nangong Liuli thought to herself upon hearing this: "This brother is meticulous. I've known that for a while, but I didn't expect him to consider things so thoroughly."

Nangong Liuli said: "Hearing you say that, I'm much more relieved." Li Xian said: "If I weren't afraid of water, I would have run away myself. Such a good opportunity, I wouldn't have left it for you two."

Nangong Liuli widened her eyes, feeling a little angry. She pretended to be pitiful and said: "Oh! So you would run away and really leave a poor woman like me behind?"

Li Xian said: "I would have in the past, but not now. Good sister... am I good to you?" Nangong Liuli's pretty face flushed slightly, secretly cursing this boy for being a heartbreaker. Such gentle words, she really couldn't resist. She couldn't help but let her beautiful eyes shimmer and leaned her head against him, saying: "Not bad."

She then嗔怪道: "But who knows if you'll change. I'm trapped here and can't escape."

Li Xian said: "You're envious of Sister Bian? Why didn't you escape back then?" Nangong Liuli said: "If you say envious... naturally I'm envious. If you say not envious, hmm..." Her cheeks flushed slightly, her eyes glanced sideways downwards, and she quickly changed the subject, saying:

"Back then, I didn't escape... it was also due to the situation. You taught me the method to untie the hanging ropes. I learned it, but Sister Bian didn't. So only I could help her untie them. Otherwise, both of us would have been hanging in the air, looking utterly pathetic, dizzy and disoriented, how could we have escaped?"

Li Xian said: "That makes sense. But if Sister Liuli wanted to solve it, it wouldn't have been difficult. You still gave the escape opportunity to Sister Bian."

"That girl is extremely reckless, blindly fleeing east. I saw her running around like that, and as soon as Ye Cheng paid a little attention, he would have captured her immediately. Then you two sisters would be staring at each other again. So I chased and guided her, forcing her out of the cabin."

"At that moment, if she had been completely spineless, it would have been a dead end. The fact that she dared to jump into the lake made me admire her quite a bit."

Nangong Liuli said: "Ah! That girl Bian, she's always been reckless. At the time, I transmitted my intention through my palm, but she probably didn't grasp the essence. But it's not her fault. The situation was urgent, and transmitting my intention through my palm was ultimately my own wishful thinking. It was asking too much to expect her to understand."

Li Xian laughed and said: "So, good sister, who should you thank?" Nangong Liuli's beautiful eyes flashed with a strange light. She was indeed very grateful. Thinking back to the situation at the time, she happened to encounter Li Xian. It was truly a mix of fortune and misfortune, very lucky. But she said嗔怪ly: "I know, thank you, you little stinking thief, bad brother."

Her red lips gently pressed against his, her cheeks very red. Her appearance and demeanor at this moment showed a captivating charm. Combined with her status as a noble lady from a wealthy family, born with elegance, it added even more charm.

Nangong Liuli worriedly said: "But... Sister Bian has a straightforward personality. Although you meant well, she doesn't know that, so she's probably resenting you right now."

Li Xian teased: "That's fine, her Sister Liuli can compensate." Then he said seriously: "It's really fine if she hates or resents me. I don't care."

Nangong Liuli said: "You're quite carefree." Her beautiful eyes glanced around, ripples shimmering in them. This free and easy aura was gradually attracting her.

Nangong Liuli said: "That's right... you said you're afraid of water, and your strength during the grand gathering wasn't bad. Have you manifested your Turbid Robe?"

Li Xian said: "I have." His expression was quite proud. Nangong Liuli said: "What kind of Turbid Robe did you manifest?"

Li Xian thought: "The matter of the Turbid Robe isn't really a big secret. It's fine to tell her." So he said: "You guess."

Nangong Liuli said: "I'm not guessing. You little flower thief, a country bumpkin, it's probably a tattered rag." Having said that, she got up and left. After walking for a moment, she came back and sat down beside Li Xian again, annoyed: "Oh! Why don't you fall for my provocation?"

Li Xian laughed and said: "You keep using the same trick. Even if I wanted to fall for it, it's hard."

Nangong Liuli said: "It's all Sister Bian's fault. Usually, I provoke her a little, and she spills everything. Now dealing with a little slicker like you, I'm helpless. Quickly tell me, sister is begging you."

Li Xian said: "Telling you is fine, but you need to agree to my condition." Nangong Liuli said: "We've already agreed on three rules, what other conditions do you need?"

Li Xian said: "Never mind, just agree." Nangong Liuli sighed: "Alright... I've walked into a bandit's den. Quickly tell me, I'll agree to anything."

Li Xian waved his hand into the empty air, and a sound of robes fluttering suddenly rang out. Pure Gang Qi Robe, hidden within the Turbid Robe, is extremely rare and hard to find. Nangong Liuli's beautiful eyes narrowed, sensing something. She said: "Ah... this... this... do it again, I didn't see it clearly."

Li Xian shook his head and smiled. Having been with Li Xian for a while, Nangong Liuli knew his nature, always playing tricks. She pleaded: "Good brother, sister will agree to anything. You... you're still hiding things from me, sister won't pay attention to you anymore."

Li Xian said: "Alright." Within the Turbid Robe, he gave a slight shake. A faint pushing force spread out. Nangong Liuli reached out to touch the empty space, feeling a texture that was neither real nor illusory brush past her. It was the "Pure Gang Qi Robe"!

Nangong Liuli was both surprised and delighted: "Good brother, good brother, you have the Pure Gang Qi Robe? You also have the Pure Gang Qi Robe?"

Li Xian coughed twice and said: "Who are you looking down on?" Nangong Liuli said: "Sister said the wrong thing. You... you're very good, this talent is very rare!"

Li Xian said: "It's just a characteristic, what's so great about it. We martial arts apprentices have no end, a long road of seeking."

Nangong Liuli happily said: "Stinky brother, you're putting on airs. You're lucky, the biggest advantage of the second level of martial arts has been taken by you."

The four characteristics of the second level of martial arts: ethereal fairy sounds, three flowers gathering at the crown, Turbid Robe draped, and hair taking root. Only the "Turbid Robe draped" shows different manifestations for each person.

Li Xian said: "Aren't there also Golden Lou Jade Robe, Eternal Dragon Robe, Wonderful Flower Heavenly Robe, and Void芥 Devil Robe? What's so great about mine."

Nangong Liuli said: "You... you're never satisfied. If we talk about subtleties, the Golden Lou Jade Robe might not necessarily be able to compare to the Pure Gang Qi Robe. The Pure Gang Qi Robe can be hidden within the Turbid Robe, but the Golden Lou Jade Robe cannot."

"And if you practice the 'Mixed Yuan Gang Qi Art' and hide your internal energy within your robe, combining martial arts characteristics with martial arts characteristics, then it will be extremely powerful!"

Li Xian casually said: "Good sister, do you have the Mixed Yuan Gang Qi Art?"

Nangong Liuli said with regret: "I haven't learned it yet, otherwise I could teach you." Li Xian said: "Do you have any martial arts you can pass on?"

Nangong Liuli sighed secretly, suddenly feeling that Li Xian was a disaster who "sought wealth," eyeing her family's wealth. Using sweet words to coax her, but in this situation, knowing that family martial arts shouldn't be easily passed on, she always found it hard to... refuse Li Xian.

Nangong Liuli said: "There are one or two martial arts that are extremely suitable for the Pure Gang Qi Robe. But... let me test you first."

Li Xian said: "Ah? With my character, what's there to test?" Nangong Liuli couldn't help but giggle, hearing Li Xian's certainty that his character was excellent, she found it funny. She said: "Your character is very good?"

Li Xian said: "Naturally, it's excellent." Nangong Liuli wrinkled her nose and said: "You're neither a gentleman nor a demon. Hanging out with thieves, what a load of nonsense."

Li Xian laughed and said: "Alright... you see me like that. Then let me show you what this flower thief is capable of."

Li Xian had just obtained the "Remnant Specter Map" and had a bet with Yan Hao. His top priority was to carefully study the mysteries of the Remnant Map. The martial arts mentioned by Nangong Liuli, although very pleasing to him, he considered that he was sincerely cooperating and had already obtained a bargain by finding time to relax. He rarely pursued martial arts-related matters.

Nangong Liuli brought it up proactively. Judging by her words, she didn't seem to have a strong intention of hiding things. If he persisted gently or forcefully, he might be able to get something. It was an unexpected joy.

Having been frightened by the ghost, Nangong Liuli actually had more topics to talk about. They chatted for a long time. Seeing that the night was getting late, with no one disturbing them and no external danger threatening, the topic gradually changed, and they moved to another location for a deeper conversation.

The rooster crowed at dawn, the sun rose high.

They went to bed late last night, and Nangong Liuli, not knowing day from night out of exhaustion, slept contentedly.

Li Xian simply put on his clothes and returned to the bedroom. He closed the doors and windows and quietly calmed his mixed energy. His pure yang physique was very strong, and even after excessive exertion, it remained robust.

Although Wen Cai'chang hadn't taught him profound martial arts, she had built a very solid physical foundation. Presumably, she also considered future happiness.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]
[Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian · Five Organs Chapter]
[Proficiency: 1386/8000 Small Success]

Li Xian moved his organ turbidity, never slacking for a day. Since reaching small success, he has gradually accumulated [1386] points of proficiency. If he accumulates like this day by day, the essentials of pure yang fundamental martial arts will surely reach their peak.

[You digest the essence of heaven and earth...]

He suddenly felt something unusual.

Li Xian frowned slightly. The signs of the Turbid Robe appeared again.

He was very curious. He already had the Pure Gang Qi Robe. If he got another Turbid Robe, what kind would it be?

Suddenly, he saw black energy rising from his body. Li Xian thought: "Could it really be the Void芥 Devil Robe? It seems I have a deep fate with Madam. I... my perfect physique and Turbid Robe are both connected to her. In the future, I'll work hard to accumulate and completely subdue this bad woman. Then I'll get my revenge, stabbing her with my sword every day."

Vaguely, he heard the wailing of ghosts and the howling of wolves, and fairy sounds echoing in his ears, very strange. It also carried an indescribable "fierce" intent.

It didn't seem like the Void芥 Devil Robe.

This was an otherworldly robe, a great fierce robe, not recorded in history, never seen before...

Its name was "Divine and Ghostly Fierce Robe"!
