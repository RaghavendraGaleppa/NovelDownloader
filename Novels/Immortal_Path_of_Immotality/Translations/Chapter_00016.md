# Chapter 16: The Ancient Tomb of Yelang

The antique market street was located in the southern part of Zangke City, but given the city's considerable size, walking there would take nearly two hours. Lin Shan decided to hail a carriage instead. 

As a martial artist, it wouldn't be appropriate for him to sprint through the streets. While disrupting the city's traffic wasn't a major concern, tarnishing his refined image was out of the question.

As for the golden bell, Lin Shan was determined to obtain it by any means necessary. There were only two approaches: strength or wealth. 

With his current Qi Transformation realm, brute force wasn't an option. As for wealth—three thousand taels of gold, equivalent to nearly thirty thousand taels of silver—was far beyond his means. 

To rapidly increase his strength, conventional cultivation was too slow. He needed ancient essence to enhance elixirs. To amass wealth quickly, he'd need ancient essence to empower weapons for sale. 

But acquiring ancient essence itself required both strength and money, creating a vicious cycle. 

"For now, I'll have to find another way," Lin Shan mused.

...

Upon arriving at the antique market, Lin Shan began carefully examining the long rows of stalls lining both sides of the street. 

From one end to the other, he combed through the stalls until dusk was approaching. Finally, at one stall, he spotted several black lotus Buddha statues.

"Young master has excellent taste!" The stall owner, a thin, unkempt young man with a wispy mustache that twitched as he spoke, was quite the persuasive salesman. "These items just came from the ancient tomb of Yelang—a thousand-year-old kingdom! These are genuine treasures, and you won't regret buying them."

Lin Shan wasted no time. He picked up the black lotus statues for closer inspection. Their design was nearly identical to the one he'd seen at the Qinghe County pawnshop. 

However, these didn't seem like genuine antiques and lacked any trace of ancient essence.

"Where did you get these statues? Are they really from the Yelang tomb?"

"Absolutely! Everything here is freshly excavated from the Yelang tomb," the vendor declared confidently.

Lin Shan glanced at the assortment of random items on the stall, including a chamber pot stamped with "Great Song Ru Kiln" on its base. He couldn't help but roll his eyes.

This guy was full of it. Time to bring out the big guns.

Lin Shan pulled out five taels of loose silver from his pocket. After a moment's hesitation—considering his tight finances—he put three back and handed the remaining two to the vendor.

"Brother, I want the truth. Where did these black lotus statues really come from?"

At the same time, he channeled his inner energy and slammed his palm onto the stone pavement. 

*Crack!* The stone split, leaving a clear inch-deep handprint.

The scrawny vendor jumped in fright and quickly confessed, "T-they're from Taoyuan Village, about three hundred li west of the city. But the village is right at the foot of Yelang Mountain, where the ancient tomb is, so I wasn't entirely lying..."

Lin Shan recalled the golden bell he'd seen at the auction house—also allegedly from the Yelang tomb. Frowning, he pressed further, "Has there been a lot of activity around the Yelang tomb recently?"

Now that he'd taken the money and witnessed Lin Shan's strength, the vendor eagerly spilled everything he knew.

"That's right! Last month, a group of tomb raiders discovered the Yelang tomb and looted some incredible artifacts. Rumor has it they found a massive black lotus Buddha statue—over ten feet tall!—that was bought for an astronomical sum by some noble from Bianliang, the capital. They also sold a golden bell to Mr. Zhao at the antique shop in the west district."

A ten-foot-tall black lotus statue! A golden bell!

Lin Shan's mind raced. If the golden bell had eight points of ancient essence, that enormous Buddha statue must have had even more—possibly much more.

The vendor grew more animated as he spoke. "After that, people flocked to the tomb hoping to strike it rich. But here's the thing—while the first group of raiders made it out safely, every single person who went in afterward never came back." 

He lowered his voice fearfully. "People outside the tomb could hear terrifying howls coming from inside. I went with the crowd too, but I didn't dare enter. I just picked up these black lotus statues from villagers in Taoyuan Village at the mountain's base."

Noticing Lin Shan's expression darken, the vendor hastily added, "I'm telling the truth, young master! I didn't mean to deceive you earlier. These statues have been selling like crazy since that nobleman's purchase. They get snapped up the moment they hit the market, so I was just trying to make a small profit. You're my first customer today!"

Lin Shan wasn't upset with the vendor. He was busy processing the information. 

Genuine artifacts from the Yelang tomb included the giant black lotus statue bought by the capital's noble and the golden bell at the antique shop—and likely others. Any relics excavated alongside the bell probably contained ancient essence.

Though later explorers hadn't returned, the first group of raiders had emerged unscathed. If more tomb relics existed, those raiders would know where they were—either keeping them or having sold them elsewhere.

The antique dealer was too powerful to confront, but mere tomb raiders? That was within his capabilities. After all, he had a side gig as a Nightingale assassin.

"Do you know where those first tomb raiders are now?" Lin Shan asked.

Seeing the vendor's puzzled look, he added with a smile, "I'm just curious about the tomb's contents and want to ask them some questions."

The vendor sighed. "Young master, you're too young to risk your life. The Yelang tomb has become forbidden ground—everyone's avoiding it now."

Lin Shan reluctantly handed over the remaining three taels of silver.

The power of money worked wonders.

The vendor's face lit up. "I only know they're retainers of Squire Wu in the west district. He runs funeral services there, so he's... well-connected in tomb-related matters, let's say." He coughed meaningfully.

Lin Shan understood immediately—Squire Wu wasn't just in the burial business; he was also involved in grave robbing. Burying people by day and digging them up by night? That was some shady operation.

After extensive questioning, Lin Shan learned that Squire Wu's men weren't particularly skilled. When he'd extracted all the information he could and noticed vendors around them packing up for the night, he finally let the man go.

To his surprise, the vendor seemed reluctant to part ways, eagerly asking if Lin Shan had more questions.

"What, do you think I'm made of money?" Lin Shan thought irritably as he hailed a carriage home.

...

That night, dressed in the assassin's trifecta—black clothes, black mask, black headscarf—Lin Shan slipped out of his courtyard and made his way stealthily to the west district.

Earlier, he'd already scouted Squire Wu's residence. With only a few funeral parlors in the area, it hadn't been hard to locate.

Scaling the wall effortlessly, he found himself in a courtyard with a small pond and a few loquat trees swaying in the breeze. 

Squire Wu apparently had refined tastes.

Moving past the main house to the rear courtyard, Lin Shan crept up to the west wing. Faint voices drifted from inside.

"The master has retired for the evening. You may leave," said a middle-aged woman's voice. 

Several maids filed out of the room, forcing Lin Shan to duck into the shadows. Once they'd gone, he returned to the door and waited. Soon, two sets of soft snores came from within.

"That must be Squire Wu and his wife," Lin Shan concluded.
