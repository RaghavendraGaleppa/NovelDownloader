# Chapter 46: The Diamond Buddha's Disciple! The Young Master of Kunlun!  

"What the hell? You can only capture but not release?" Inside the alms bowl, a gentle voice erupted in furious curses. "You useless, unlearned fool!"  

"So, does that mean you can only release it once you've mastered the technique?" The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its tender branches joyfully. "When will you master this technique? Ten years? Twenty? This is my guest—you must treat it well. Try to master the technique within five years, alright?"  

"Master, just chop it down with one strike," the wall-clinging bird wailed. "I don’t want to be trapped inside for five years. This is worse than being locked up in the Thunder Prison of the back mountains..."  

"This artifact isn’t made of clay—how can I just chop through it?" Li Zhengjing frowned slightly, glancing at his left arm. "But we can certainly try."  

"No, you can’t! This artifact is borrowed!" Monk Jia quickly intervened. "If it gets damaged, I’ll have to compensate for it—at least by building three or five more temples to make up for it."  

"All your artifacts are borrowed?" Li Zhengjing gave him a look, slightly envious. He was practically penniless, and the narrow black blade in his hand barely qualified as a low-grade spiritual tool, far from the level of a proper artifact.  

"My master is the Chief Arhat of the Vajra Hall. This descent from the mountain involves various factions, and the Venom King Xin Xuan is quite dangerous, so I was lent these artifacts for protection." Monk Jia sighed. "In return, I promised that the Jia family would send craftsmen to gild the eighteen Arhat statues in the Vajra Hall..."  

"..." Li Zhengjing’s face remained expressionless, as if completely unfazed.  

"So what do we do now?" The wall-clinging bird sobbed. "You bald donkey, if you can’t release it, why weren’t you more careful when using it? Must I be trapped for ten or eight years? By the time I get out, I’ll be an old bird—how am I supposed to find a wife at that age?"  

"That won’t be necessary!" Monk Jia quickly reassured. "I came here with the Buddha’s disciple. He’s resting in the pavilion up ahead. I just stepped out to relieve myself when I saw you, Second Brother, and thought you were a vengeful ghost lingering after death..."  

"The Buddha’s disciple?" Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow. "The most outstanding figure of the current generation in the Vajra Temple? Rumor has it he’s the most likely in this era to achieve the Sixteen-Foot Golden Body!"  

Among the outstanding talents of the current era, this Diamond Buddha’s disciple was also renowned. He was on par with Lu Huaiyuan, the top true disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect!  

"Second Brother knows of him?" Monk Jia said. "He treats me well. Let’s go to him to undo the golden bowl’s seal..."  

"Alright, let’s go."  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page—his fortune hadn’t changed, so there was no danger in going.  

Monk Jia then collected his artifacts, cradled the alms bowl in his hands, and led the way.  

Li Zhengjing observed his appearance—the bald head—and recalled the man’s past flamboyance, finding it all rather awkward.  

"Logically speaking, you’ve only been in the sect for half a year, and the Vajra Temple holds you in such high regard. Why would they send you on such a dangerous mission?"  

"With the Buddha’s disciple leading, it’s hardly dangerous." Monk Jia rubbed his bald head. "Besides, I heard the Venom King Xin Xuan, the one being hunted, was the one who poisoned you half a year ago. I figured the Buddha’s disciple, with his compassionate nature, probably wouldn’t kill him. So I planned to personally chop off his head to avenge you!"  

"That’s thoughtful of you." Li Zhengjing nodded. "I left the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect and traveled thousands of miles, only arriving today. The Vajra Temple is over twenty thousand miles away—how did you get here so quickly?"  

"The Buddha’s disciple used his kasaya artifact as a flying vessel," Monk Jia explained. "With his divine abilities, we traveled day and night—unbelievably fast."  

The two brothers chatted as they made their way to the pavilion.  

Before long, they spotted a monk sitting cross-legged inside.  

The monk appeared to be in his thirties, eyes closed in meditation as he recited scriptures. An aura surrounded him, enveloping the entire pavilion and warding off all evil.  

At that moment, he opened his eyes, clasped his hands, and said calmly, "Shi Fang, why have you brought a fellow disciple from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect?"  

Monk Jia stepped forward, about to speak.  

But the Diamond Buddha’s disciple raised a finger.  

A golden light shot from his fingertip, crossing a distance of ten zhang to land on the golden bowl in Monk Jia’s arms.  

The seal on the bowl broke instantly, and a green-horned, golden-feathered bird flew out, cursing loudly.  

"How peculiar."  

"It’s clearly a bird, yet it has dragon horns."  

"The row of bone spikes on its back must be tiger bones."  

"And its beak and claws resemble those of the Blazing Divine Eagle, unique to the Southern Wastelands."  

"Your avian ancestry is rather... mixed."  

The Diamond Buddha’s disciple smiled faintly as he studied the bird.  

The wall-clinging bird hovered mid-air, pondering, *Is this bald donkey complimenting or insulting me?*  

The Five Elements Creation Tree quietly waved its branches behind Li Zhengjing and whispered, "Master, this monk has sharp eyes. He instantly recognized that the bird is a mixed-blood hybrid."  

Li Zhengjing didn’t respond. Instead, he stepped forward and said, "Li Zhengjing, inner disciple of the Ancient Moon Peak of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, greets the Buddha’s disciple."  

The Diamond Buddha’s disciple stood and returned the greeting solemnly. "Has this junior brother come under orders to question me?"  

Li Zhengjing shook his head. "I merely happened to pass by."  

The Buddha’s disciple nodded. "Whether you came here by chance or under orders, I ask that you relay a message on my behalf to avoid misunderstandings."  

He looked at Li Zhengjing seriously. "Only myself and Junior Brother Shi Fang have come from the Vajra Temple this time. There will be no further reinforcements. Please rest assured."  

"If the opportunity arises, I will report this to the sect."  

Li Zhengjing had already anticipated this.  

Though the Xuanling Prefecture was under the Great Zhou’s jurisdiction and not the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect’s domain, it was still close to their territory.  

A prestigious immortal sect would never tolerate large numbers of outsiders gathering near their doorstep.  

Other factions, aware of this, might still send people to assist the Great Zhou in capturing the fugitive for various reasons. However, their numbers would be minimal.  

"Thank you."  

The Diamond Buddha’s disciple bowed.  

Li Zhengjing returned the gesture and beckoned the wall-clinging bird to perch on his shoulder.  

Having not seen Jia Shifang for over half a year, he was reluctant to part so soon. The two chatted for a while longer.  

The Diamond Buddha’s disciple glanced their way a few times. Seeing that the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect disciple showed no intention of leaving, he seemed to want to say something but ultimately shook his head and let it be.  

Meanwhile, as Li Zhengjing and Jia Shifang caught up, he noticed the golden page flickering—his fortune had changed.  

**Fortune:** In a quarter-hour, the Young Master of the Kunlun Immortal Sect will arrive. Sensing that you possess the Kunlun Sect’s sealed supreme sword technique, the *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi*, he will realize your connection to the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord. He will then forcibly subdue you and take you back to the Kunlun Immortal Sect for interrogation!  

**Method to Alter Fate:** ...Insufficient spiritual energy!  

*What?!*  

Li Zhengjing was stunned.  

The Young Master of the Kunlun Immortal Sect would arrive in a quarter-hour?  

And he would detect the *Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi* within him?  

Did this Young Master know of the existence of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord?
