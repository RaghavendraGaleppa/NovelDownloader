# Chapter 54: The Six Arts of Cultivation

Immortal Huang led Lin Shan into the top-floor private room. As they entered, four pairs of eyes immediately turned their way, all scrutinizing Lin Shan with surprise at his youthful appearance despite having reached mid-stage Qi Refinement. As for Immortal Huang, the group had clearly seen him many times over the years and paid him little attention.

Under Immortal Huang's introduction, Lin Shan took his turn examining the four individuals before him. He couldn't be bothered to memorize which prince's estate they served or which faction employed them—his focus was on sensing their cultivation levels.

The green-robed old man with a strange laugh, the black-robed female Daoist, and the middle-aged man with a hooked nose were all at mid-stage Qi Refinement. The last person, a taciturn figure wearing a bamboo hat, was only at early-stage Qi Refinement.

Immortal Huang curiously inquired about the hat-wearer's background, as this person hadn't been part of their previous gatherings.

"A humble daughter of Duke Qi, fortunate enough to be discovered with spiritual roots. I was guided into the path of cultivation by an immortal master serving our household. I'll need everyone's guidance on this journey to Yichuan," came a gentle female voice from beneath the hat, suggesting a young woman in the bloom of youth.

Through conversation, they learned she had joined today's gathering through the black-robed Daoist's connections. The other two weren't familiar with her either.

The group quickly warmed up to each other. While the young woman remained quiet, the other three showed keen interest in Lin Shan, treating him as an equal—after all, they were all mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators with presumably similar strength.

What they didn't know was that Lin Shan was essentially a paper tiger—devoid of spells, magical artifacts, or talismans. Aside from his decent escape skills, he was woefully unprepared.

The two early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators were largely ignored by the trio, as the gap between early and mid-stage was something they'd all experienced firsthand.

Lin Shan felt somewhat flattered yet uneasy, sensing genuine danger from these three—they could truly threaten him! It made sense; having served as retainers in the mortal world for decades, they'd accumulated spirit stones and visited Yichuan's cultivation marketplaces, undoubtedly armed with talismans and artifacts—proper cultivators unlike himself.

After just two years of stumbling through cultivation and relying on enhancement to reach the sixth layer of Qi Refinement, Lin Shan had yet to truly enter the cultivation world.

...

Once acquainted, the black-robed Daoist proposed an exchange session for their idle items. Nodding in agreement, everyone began producing their treasures.

The Daoist produced a stack of low-grade water-attribute talismans—Water Arrow spells.

The hooked-nose man revealed a pitch-black iron sword—a low-grade magical artifact.

The green-robed elder produced a gourd filled with densely packed moths—clearly spirit insects.

The young woman placed a blue orb on the table, another artifact.

When Lin Shan's turn came, he produced his Warm Sun Jade Pendant to fit in.

As for Immortal Huang, everyone knew he'd returned alone twenty years ago with nothing but spirit stones to his name, having never left the capital since.

...

With items displayed, the black-robed Daoist made the first offer: "Water Arrow talismans—one spirit stone per stack of ten. I crafted them myself. Any takers?"

Silence followed. Water Arrow was among the most basic low-grade spells, akin to wind blades or fireballs—something everyone could cast hundreds of times without needing talismans.

Lin Shan was surprised the Daoist could craft talismans—an impressive skill. He offered some compliments, seeing no harm in flattery to build rapport.

The Daoist shook her head wryly at his praise. "I can only make basic talismans with little market value. Only when I can craft intermediate-level spells will I gain footing in cultivation marketplaces." As she put away her simple creations, she added, "My skills pale next to these two masters' artifact-forging and beast-taming arts."

The hooked-nose man and green-robed elder modestly dismissed her praise, claiming their own skills were too rudimentary to establish themselves in marketplaces.

Lin Shan listened to their humble exchanges, suddenly realizing with dismay: Everyone here has remarkable skills!

So I'm the only useless one? Completely skill-less?

He recalled the Six Arts of Cultivation mentioned in the Guangnan Wanderer's biography: alchemy, artifact-forging, talismans, formations, beast-taming, and puppetry.

Mastering any one could ensure prosperity anywhere! These skills not only enhanced personal strength but could be traded for spirit stones!

Most Qi Refinement cultivators chose one art to specialize in alongside their cultivation—skills couldn't be neglected.

Lin Shan inwardly groaned at the competitiveness even among rogue cultivators. These people were retainers in mortal kingdoms yet still honed their skills!

Was Immortal Huang the only one content to idle?

...

With no takers for the talismans, the hooked-nose man presented his iron sword artifact:

"A low-grade artifact I previously used. I attempted modifying its inscriptions and restrictions but encountered minor... issues. Still functional! Twenty spirit stones—no, fifteen will suffice!"

The green-robed elder scoffed, "Modifying? More like botching while studying inscription and forging techniques! With your amateur skills, you probably damaged this artifact beyond repair before selling it!"

Flustered, the hooked-nose man vehemently denied this. Observing his reaction, the others inspected the sword before shaking their heads in disinterest.

Lin Shan also examined it, prompting his enhancement interface:

[Refined Iron Sword] (Moderate Damage)
Quality: Low-grade Artifact
Description: Forged from hundred-thousand-fold refined iron. Low-grade sharpness and durability enchantments (half of internal inscriptions damaged).
Enhancement Cost: 8 points

...

Lin Shan studied the sword. Hundred-thousand-fold refined iron was a low-grade spiritual material, inferior to naturally occurring refined iron—this was clearly mass-produced.

Yet the hooked-nose man had somehow managed to "moderately damage" a perfectly functional artifact! Lin Shan wondered how he'd "studied" it to ruin half the sharpness and durability inscriptions. How many uses could it have left?

After others finished inspecting, Lin Shan offered, "Ten spirit stones."

The man frowned. "Low-grade artifacts typically fetch twenty to fifty stones. Fifteen is already generous!"

Lin Shan shook his head. "Half the inscriptions are damaged. It won't last long."

As the man hesitated, Immortal Huang—realizing he'd need Lin Shan's protection en route to Yichuan—intervened: "Having spent twenty years in Yichuan, I'd say this artifact is nearly scrap. A smithy might give four or five stones for recycling."

Catching Immortal Huang's meaningful glance, Lin Shan realized even ten stones was overpaying.

Before he could adjust his offer, the hooked-nose man stood abruptly. "Deal! Ten stones it is!"

Noticing the odd looks from the Daoist and elder—as if he'd been swindled—Lin Shan wryly paid and took the damaged sword.

...

Originally possessing eight stones plus fifty from Nightingale's elder (with thirty reserved for a Vermilion Fruit), Lin Shan could spare ten for a low-grade artifact—especially since his interface showed it could be enhanced.

If he could upgrade it to mid-grade, the purchase would be worthwhile.

Every opportunity to strengthen himself before reaching Yichuan was precious.

...

Next, the green-robed elder unstopped his gourd, releasing a flurry of gray moths.
