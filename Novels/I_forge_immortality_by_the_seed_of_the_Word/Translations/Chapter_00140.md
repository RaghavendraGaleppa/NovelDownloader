# Chapter 138: Immortal Transformation Pool

Feng Wuyu ignored Lu Sanshiba and instead looked directly at Zhang Jing with a hint of envy in his voice:  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, you should take this white deer with you. It would make an excellent attendant in the future. Although its cultivation is somewhat lacking, it can still barely enter the Immortal Transformation Pool. Moreover, the ancestral innate technique it inherited is recorded within our sect."  

"That's right, that's right! What he said is absolutely correct, Master. Please take me with you!"  

Lu Sanshiba chimed in eagerly, his large eyes brimming with hope.  

Seeing this, Zhang Jing bowed respectfully to Feng Wuyu and said politely,  

"In that case, I'll trouble you, Senior Brother."  

"Haha, it's nothing."  

Initially, Zhang Jing had decided not to bring Lu Sanshiba not because he didn’t want to, but because he didn’t know how. Now, with Senior Brother Feng Wuyu’s offer, his concerns were resolved.  

"Hehe, thank you, Master!"  

Overjoyed at Zhang Jing’s agreement, Lu Sanshiba leaped up from the ground and stood proudly by his side, his earlier pitiful demeanor completely gone.  

"Master, where are we going?" Lu Sanshiba whispered.  

"The Upper Realm. And you probably won’t be coming back," Zhang Jing explained.  

Upon hearing this, Lu Sanshiba raised his head high, his heart aching as he gazed at the lush, verdant medicinal herbs covering the mountainside—all planted by his own hooves.  

He hadn’t even tasted them yet, and now he had to leave them behind.  

"What’s wrong? Reluctant to leave? You don’t have to come if you don’t want to. I’ve already spoken with the Academy Head. You can stay here and tend to the herbs," Zhang Jing teased, noticing Lu Sanshiba’s hesitation.  

"No, no! I’m willing, Master! I’m absolutely willing!" Lu Sanshiba hastily replied, forcing a smile.  

Just then, Feng Wuyu interjected,  

"Junior Brother, it’s time to depart."  

With those words, a bronze Dao Domain suddenly expanded beneath Feng Wuyu’s feet, instantly enveloping Zhang Jing and Lu Sanshiba.  

In the next moment, a bronze divine light shot into the sky, reaching the stratospheric winds thousands of feet above in the blink of an eye.  

Boom—  

The intrusion of the bronze light immediately triggered a violent reaction from the stratospheric winds.  

Countless icy, razor-sharp gales converged, forming a terrifying black tempest spanning hundreds of thousands of miles, furiously surging toward the bronze light as if determined to tear it apart.  

Meanwhile, back on the immortal island where Zhang Jing had resided, dozens of figures gradually appeared—the Academy Head, the five Pavilion Masters, and numerous inner disciples, including You Yuanming, Qiu Xiumin, Yang Bai, and Liu Lizhi. Most were familiar faces to Zhang Jing.  

"Has he left?" the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master asked wistfully.  

"Yes, he’s gone," the Academy Head replied calmly, though a faint trace of emptiness lingered in his voice.  

After a long silence, he sighed and said,  

"Seal this immortal island. And ensure Zhang Jing’s family in Yuyang City is well taken care of."  

"Rest assured, Academy Head," the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master replied with a faint smile. Then, as if struck by a thought, he tentatively added,  

"By the way, since Zhang Jing was an inner disciple of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, it’s only reasonable for his younger siblings to join our pavilion when they enter the academy, don’t you think?"  

The other four Pavilion Masters immediately darkened their expressions.  

They had seen shameless people before, but never one this brazen.  

High above the heavens, the bronze divine light traversed countless trillions of miles, piercing through layers of tempestuous winds and thunderfire before arriving at a void-like expanse.  

Then, space itself was torn apart.  

The bronze light vanished into the rift.  

Inside the bronze Dao Domain, Lu Sanshiba widened his eyes pitifully at his master.  

But Zhang Jing paid him no heed.  

The deer had been chattering nonstop throughout the journey, and Zhang Jing, unable to tolerate it any longer, had sealed his mouth with a spell.  

Finally, peace and quiet.  

Standing at the edge of the Dao Domain, Zhang Jing peered through the layers of thunderfire and gales, faintly glimpsing an indescribably vast land—majestic, boundless, and immeasurable.  

Even from billions of miles away, it dominated his entire field of vision.  

"Could any cultivator possibly traverse such a land?" he marveled inwardly.  

At his current level, he was certain he couldn’t.  

Even if he flew at full speed without stopping, covering dozens of miles in an instant, it would likely take him a thousand years to cross even a fraction of that land.  

"This is the Jun Tian Domain, Junior Brother—one of the nine lower realms. Long ago, before the concept of 'lower realms' even existed, Jun Tian was the center of this world. The Dao of Immortality flourished here, giving rise to countless undying Dao Sovereigns. Unfortunately, it was destroyed in the great war of antiquity..."  

Feng Wuyu’s voice carried a tinge of regret and longing.  

"A war?" Zhang Jing asked curiously.  

"Indeed, the war that established our human race. If you wish to learn more, you can research it yourself once we return to the Clear Heaven Profound Bright Realm. The reason the Dao principles of the lower realms are incomplete—or why the nine domains became lower realms—is because of that war. It happened so long ago that its origins are lost to time."  

As if remembering something, Feng Wuyu added,  

"Oh, Junior Brother, I forgot to mention. Our sect is called the Supreme Unity Infinite Dao Gate, divided into various grotto-heavens, blessed lands, and Dharma realms. I’m taking you to the Crimson Brilliance Supreme Radiance Grotto-Heaven, one of the ten great grotto-heavens. Your future master, who is also my teacher, is known as the True Monarch Yuanming, also called the Lord of the True Sun Realm."  

"Grotto-heavens, blessed lands, Dharma realms... True Monarch Yuanming..." Zhang Jing repeated silently before nodding gratefully.  

"Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother. I’ll remember."  

Time passed slowly.  

In a special region of the Clear Heaven Profound Bright Realm, there stood a vast lake, ten thousand feet in diameter, surrounded by emptiness.  

What made it extraordinary was the milky-white water shimmering with pure, sacred light.  

This was the Immortal Transformation Pool.  

At that moment, two young men in white robes were meticulously polishing the jade railings around the lake.  

"Honestly, the sect shouldn’t recruit people from the lower realms. Every time they do, we have to activate this pool, consuming an immeasurable amount of resources," the taller one grumbled.  

"Exactly! Those lower realm thieves are stealing resources that rightfully belong to us. So many of our fellow disciples are stuck just before the Dao Unification stage because of them," the shorter one sighed. "And judging by the timing, another batch of those thieves will be arriving soon."  

Just then, a bronze divine light materialized beside the pool, revealing two figures and a deer.  

The two white-robed men immediately straightened up and hurried over, bowing respectfully.  

"Greetings, Senior Brother."  

"Activate the Immortal Transformation Pool. This junior brother and the deer are to enter and complete their Dao principles," Feng Wuyu commanded impassively.
