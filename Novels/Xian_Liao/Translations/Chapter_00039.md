# Chapter 39: Unrestrained Joy

After entering Changzhou City, Zhou Qing bid farewell to the martial escort leader Wu and his team from the Weiyuan Escort Agency.

Escort Leader Wu was somewhat reluctant to part ways. Zhou Qing's conversation and insights often gave him a refreshing perspective, especially regarding the operation of the escort agency. Although Zhou Qing didn't fully understand the business, some of their discussions provided Wu with unique inspiration.

In truth, Zhou Qing had merely mentioned a few modern logistics concepts during their conversations, which had similarities to the escort business. Given Wu's extensive experience, he was naturally sensitive to such ideas.

Wu didn't think Zhou Qing was a seasoned escort, but he admired the scholar's quick wit and unique perspective, which offered valuable insights. With the world becoming increasingly chaotic, Wu needed to make more preparations to maintain and even expand the agency's operations.

Moreover, Miss Lin had hinted that Zhou Qing had a high chance of passing the provincial examination. If Zhou Qing succeeded, his status alone would positively influence the Weiyuan Escort Agency.

Running an escort agency was like doing business. With fewer official obstacles, their competitiveness would increase, making it easier to grow stronger.

The Weiyuan Escort Agency had its own connections, but in these times, who would complain about having more official friends?

Additionally, Daoist Priest Fusong's martial skills were unfathomable. He had effortlessly dealt with over a dozen bandits, including two skilled lay disciples from the Golden Light Temple.

Wu didn't believe Zhou Qing had played a significant role in the incident. Even with the dense forest and darkness as factors, Fusong's prowess couldn't be ignored. Upon inspecting the corpses, Wu found wounds from crossbow bolts and iron pellets—clearly hidden weapons.

The crossbow wounds were particularly alarming. The fact that Qingfu Temple possessed such weapons proved the saying, "A starved camel is still bigger than a horse."

Under Zhou Qing and Fusong's suggestion, they specially treated and partially burned the corpses with crossbow wounds to conceal the evidence, avoiding complications if officials came to investigate. The bandits' heads were severed and preserved for sale to the local magistrate.

These heads were solid achievements. A dozen heads could fetch a good price, and if the magistrate already had a good record, it might even earn him a promotion.

However, this required leveraging the Weiyuan Escort Agency's connections. Success would not only bring profit but also solidify relationships—a win-win situation.

---

Escort Leader Wu purchased the heads at 80% of the standard bounty price. After deducting operational costs, the profit was minimal. But by selling them at the regular price to the authorities, he gained intangible benefits, such as deeper connections—something money couldn't buy.

If Zhou Qing and Fusong had handled it themselves, it would have been far more troublesome, possibly even attracting unwanted attention. After all, Zhou Qing was merely a scholar, and Qingfu Temple lacked its former influence. The 80% price was more than fair.

Both parties were satisfied.

As they watched Escort Leader Wu depart, Fusong reluctantly handed the silver notes to Zhou Qing.

"Senior Brother, I promised to donate a thousand strings of coins to Qingfu Temple if I pass the provincial exam. Since I'm confident I'll succeed, consider this an advance on that donation."

Fusong shook his head. "Junior Brother, your skills are already solid. Even without me, you'd have been fine. Forget about the donation."

Zhou Qing was surprised. Despite Fusong's usual love for money, he was refusing the silver and even waiving the promised donation.

"Senior Brother, without you, things might not have gone so smoothly. Besides, the exam isn't over yet—I still need your help. Keep the money. As the saying goes, 'Spend a fortune, and it will return.' Once I achieve success, wealth will follow." Though Zhou Qing needed money, his priority was the exam.

Without Fusong holding off the skilled bandits, Zhou Qing doubted he could have escaped unscathed, even with all his tricks. His combat experience was still lacking.

Fortunately, his previous training in stealth and night movement had paid off. Without that groundwork, this victory wouldn't have been possible.

Success depends on people. Money matters, but once he passed the exam, he could always earn more. Wealth could be regained, but trust was harder to come by.

He recalled a saying from his past life: "When you succeed, you'll find everyone around you is kind."

History's great leaders, like Emperor Gaozu of Han or the Hongwu Emperor, built their core teams from childhood friends. The exception was Emperor Taizong of Tang, Li Shimin, whose charisma was unmatched.

Zhou Qing's mentor had admired Li Shimin, describing him as a life of blazing brilliance.

At the time, Zhou Qing had watched a historical drama about the Zhenguan era, sparking a fascination with historical strategy. Now, some of his actions mirrored those ancient figures.

Fusong sighed. "Junior Brother, you usually keep your thoughts hidden. I didn't expect such a carefree side to you."

Zhou Qing smiled. "Senior Brother flatters me. My carefreeness is just a facade—a small cleverness. I know my limits."

Fusong chuckled, saying nothing more. Their bond had subtly deepened—not just from words, but from tangible benefits. A promised donation and actual silver notes carried different meanings.

To maintain long-term relationships, mutual benefit was key. Just as Li Shimin's brothers had turned against him, while his followers were willing to die for him. Even the closest blood ties could be severed by conflicting interests.

Zhou Qing knew Fusong's closeness differed from Butcher Hu's. Hu would die for him because Hu desperately sought recognition, and his only bargaining chip was his life. Many like Hu didn't even have that privilege.

Compared to them, Zhou Qing was far luckier.

---

The two arrived at the Wanfu Inn in Changzhou, a common lodging for examination candidates. The Lin family had reserved rooms in advance. Zhou Qing chose this inn because it was filled with fellow candidates, reducing the risk of trouble.

Staying elsewhere in an unfamiliar city would invite unnecessary dangers. His earlier joke about attending the lantern festival was just that—a joke. Now, he needed peace until the exam.

But trouble always found a way.

"Scholar Zhou? Perfect timing. Young Master Zhang from the Zhang family has reserved a banquet for you. He's staying next door."

Zhou Qing felt as if a venomous snake had locked onto him. The man was relentless.

He had expected Zhang Shen's persistence. With his recent battle experience and Fusong by his side, Zhou Qing felt somewhat secure. Even if he refused the invitation, Zhang would surely have other tricks.

Their lack of power meant they could only react as situations arose. But Zhang's aggression only fueled Zhou Qing's murderous intent.

---

In a private room, Zhang Shen maintained his noble demeanor, flanked by burly guards and two monks eating vegetarian dishes.

"Brother Zhou, I didn't think you'd dare come," Zhang Shen said with a smirk.

Scholars typically addressed each other as friends, but Zhang's tone was mocking.

Zhou Qing replied calmly, "Your place is no dragon's den or tiger's lair. Why wouldn't I come?"

Zhang clapped his hands and smiled at Fusong. "Daoist Priest, with your skills to subdue dragons and tigers, why not join the Zhang family as a guest elder?"

Fusong declined. "This humble Daoist is a wild crane, accustomed to freedom. Your family's wealth is beyond me."

Zhang sneered. "So Qingfu Temple values Brother Zhou more than my family."

Fusong's dislike grew. In his youth, even the Zhang family patriarch wouldn't have dared speak so disrespectfully to Qingfu Temple's master. He remained silent.

Zhang turned back to Zhou Qing. "Brother Zhou, this exam is just a formality for you. I'll be frank—I will pass. If you agree to be my study companion now, it's not too late. Otherwise, even with Prefect Lu's support, you'll go nowhere."

He was laying his cards on the table, pressuring Zhou Qing. The late Zhang patriarch had been Prefect Lu's mentor. That bond wasn't easily broken.

Zhou Qing smiled faintly. "If you're so confident, why bother with me? You don't need my companionship." He stood. "Farewell."

Fusong followed him out.

Once they left, Zhang's face darkened. "Masters, what do you think?"

One monk replied, "The inn isn't the place for action. With Daoist Fusong here, even if we win, we might not protect you."

"Is Qingfu Temple's martial arts that formidable?"

The monk sighed. "Fusong has mastered Gang Jin. If he were younger, at his peak, all of us combined wouldn't stand a chance."

Zhang frowned. "I'm confident about the exam, but Zhou Qing is unpredictable. If he passes, things spiral out of control. Can you stop him from attending?"

The monk hesitated. "We can try, but no guarantees."

Zhang nodded. "Regardless, your temple's donation and compensation for your lay disciples will be delivered."

"Thank you, Young Master."

Zhang seethed, resenting the Lin family and the incompetent Black Tiger Gang. If not for their bungling, the Lin family wouldn't have connected Zhou Qing to Qingfu Temple. He hadn't expected the declining temple to still have masters like Fusong.

In all of Changzhou, Gang Jin masters were rare. The Golden Light Temple had only three elders and one exceptional young monk with such skills—the latter now serving as the chief instructor under Military Commissioner Song He of Tiannan Circuit.

Song was the nominal chief examiner for the provincial exam, while Prefect Lu was the deputy. Zhang's success would call in the favor the Zhang family was owed. If Zhou Qing, also connected to Prefect Lu, passed, it would cause an uproar. To prevent scandal, the simplest solution was to ensure Zhou Qing never took the exam.

But Zhou Qing wouldn't back down.

"You had your chance," Zhang muttered, his hatred for Zhou Qing boiling over.

---

Fusong relayed the overheard conversation to Zhou Qing.

Though he had anticipated it, Zhou Qing's killing intent surged at Zhang's determination to block him. Why did such fools exist? Why must they push him?

All he wanted was to pass the exam and secure his future. Was that so wrong?

He couldn't tolerate Zhang's stupidity and malice. The calmer his expression, the fiercer his inner turmoil. "With you here, Senior Brother, I'm confident I'll take the exam."

Fusong sighed. "I'll do my best." At over fifty, his prime was long past. In his youth, these Golden Light Temple monks wouldn't have been a match. His explosive power remained, but his stamina and vitality had waned.

One-on-one was different from facing multiple opponents. Using Gang Jin would drain him, even if he killed one. But his years of meditation helped him endure the mental strain.

---

In the following days, Zhou Qing stayed indoors, even during the lantern festival. He avoided visiting Prefect Lu, knowing gossip could harm him.

He discovered Zhang Shen wasn't truly next door—a decoy occupied the room. Zhou Qing identified Zhang's real location by the unique herbal scent of Five-Fragrance Pills Zhang took to maintain cleanliness.

Enhanced senses from his Five Animals training, especially the Bear stance, allowed Zhou Qing to track the scent. Zhang had booked five adjacent rooms for security.

Zhou Qing bided his time until the exam day's Chou hour (1–3 AM), when sleep was deepest. Despite Zhang's confidence, he'd still rest before the exam.

Zhou Qing had scouted the area nightly, unnoticed even by the monks. His Ghost Step technique gave him confidence to infiltrate Zhang's room. For the exam, Zhang slept alone, with guards outside after lights out.

Fusong pretended not to notice Zhou Qing's nightly excursions, focusing only on ensuring his exam attendance. Zhou Qing had his own plans.

Zhou Qing knew killing Zhang was necessary. If Zhang passed, Zhou Qing's situation would worsen. Even Prefect Lu's protection wouldn't shield him from hidden daggers.

---

At the Chou hour, Zhou Qing slipped into Zhang's room during a gust of wind. His movements, masked by the noise, were flawless. A poisoned iron sword pierced Zhang's heart, while Zhou Qing's powerful grip silenced any cry.

The poison ensured death. Zhou Qing added snake venom to the wound for certainty.

He left as smoothly as he came, like a fleeting nocturne.

Unrestrained joy filled him, but celebration would wait.

The provincial exam—bring it on!
