# Chapter 136: The Nine Peaks Bell

As Xu Yunfan narrated everything, his knuckles tightened around the handle of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer until it creaked. The sound of Zhan Yan's wineskin bursting was particularly sharp within the Thunderfire Cave.

The magma conduits cast a crimson glow on the old man's hair and beard.

"Zhou Yuande was a Incense Fire Cultist?"

Zhan Yan's voice was as deep as muffled thunder, and the hands that had forged iron for thirty years were actually trembling slightly.

"Before he died, he shouted, 'May the Bright Lord descend and grant me eternal life,' no different from those madmen from the Incense Fire Cult in Wuzhou."

"Yunfan, this matter is of great importance. The words of my Casting Weapon Hall alone may not be convincing to the other departments. If this is true, the Incense Fire Cult has hidden itself too deeply and has been plotting for a long time. Once they make their move, the entire Sky Crafting Cave might be destroyed in an instant."

The old man's throat bobbed as he said in a low voice, "Come with me to the Sky Crafting Hall and strike the Nine Peaks Bell! I will have Fu Jin gather the disciples of the Casting Weapon Hall to prepare for any eventuality."

When the ninth toll of the bell echoed across the peak of Guniu Mountain, Yan Yuwei, who had just rushed to the Melting Gold Hall's驻地, suddenly froze. She instantly realized that Xu Yunfan had acted before her.

Without further hesitation, she took the identity of the chief disciple of the Melting Gold Hall and summoned all its disciples, while simultaneously sending a message to the Sky Crafting Department and the chief disciples of the Mechanism Hall.

When matters are urgent, one must act swiftly to correct the situation.

Before the Sky Crafting Hall, the bronze prosthesis of the Mechanism Hall's head, Mo Han, was jammed in the door's gears. Even faint arcs of electricity were spreading from the embedded mechanism.

The old man, famous for his mechanisms, was now being electrocuted, his hair and beard standing on end, his expression one of disbelief. Sparks flew from the joints of his prosthesis. "How could the Xuanji Lock be bolted from the inside?"

"Everyone, get back!"

The roar of the Sky Crafting Department's Hall Master, Wan Chen, accompanied the sound of a giant red copper axe cleaving the air.

As the heat radiating from him intensified, the moment the axe blade struck the door seam, the floor tiles of the entire hall suddenly flipped over, revealing a formation of sharp, armor-piercing crossbow bolts beneath.

In the nick of time, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swept across with the force of wind and thunder.

Xu Yunfan's back muscles swelled like furious dragons raising their heads, and the hammerhead precisely struck the mechanism's central hub. Three hundred and sixty poison-tipped crossbow bolts grazed the tops of their heads and embedded themselves in the pillars.

"A force of a thousand pounds..."

Wan Chen, the head of the Sky Crafting Department who cultivated the Xuan Gui Tuo Shan Jin and possessed a physique even more massive than Yue Shan, was somewhat surprised. It was hard to imagine that Xu Yunfan, who seemed so small in his eyes, possessed such immense strength.

"The mechanisms have been tampered with."

Mechanism Hall Head Mo Han's expression darkened. He was the first to step into the hall, pressing his hand against the wall of the Sky Crafting Hall's main seat. Immediately, various mechanism valves, hubs, and all sorts of incomprehensible contraptions flipped out from beneath his feet.

There was no time for further explanation. Mo Han buried his head, adjusting the mechanisms. For a time, the sounds of gears turning and mechanisms springing echoed continuously throughout the entire Sky Crafting Cave.

Zhan Yan, clad in blood-red heavy armor, stepped into the hall, the patterns on his armor flashing with a cold light.

He glanced at Mo Han, who was muttering curses as he worked, and said in a deep voice, "The only one who could alter the entire Sky Crafting City's mechanisms without you noticing is probably Bao Yan of the Hidden Blade Pavilion."

Seeing this scene, Zhan Yan's belief in Xu Yunfan's words grew even stronger.

The Hidden Blade Pavilion housed the weapons of the entire Sky Crafting Cave and was responsible for garrison and apprehension, so it naturally had the authority to use the various mechanisms of the Mechanism City.

Only then did everyone realize that Zhou Yuande of the External Affairs Hall and Bao Yan of the Hidden Blade Pavilion had not appeared under the Nine Peaks Bell.

"Where is the Sect Master?"

Wan Chen of the Sky Crafting Department spoke in a muffled, drum-like voice, and the giant axe in his hand was even more exaggerated.

Zhan Yan's heart sank further, and he subconsciously glanced at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan naturally felt Zhan Yan's gaze and was somewhat speechless inwardly.

If the Sky Crafting Cave's Sect Master, Hong Baichuan, was also a member of the Incense Fire Cult, then that was it; the game was over. Xu Yunfan would inform Zhan Yan and then turn around and leave without hesitation, heading straight out of Cangzhou.

"It's fixed!"

As Mo Han's slightly relieved voice rang out, his bronze prosthesis suddenly exploded with seven layers of gears, and three hundred and sixty copper wedges shot into the mechanism holes in the hall walls.

With a grating sound of twisting metal, the hall's roof slowly opened, revealing a sky shrouded in leaden clouds.

Mo Han wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. Since the founding of the Sky Crafting Cave, the entire cave had been continuously built. Now, over a thousand years had passed, and the Sky Crafting City was still being refined and improved under the joint efforts of the Mechanism Hall and the Sky Crafting Department. The entire city was riddled with mechanisms, and many were interconnected.

If they couldn't adjust it in time, the entire Sky Crafting City would likely be completely paralyzed for several days. If an enemy attacked during these days, the entire Sky Crafting Cave would be left defenseless.

"A Thousand Eyes, go!"

Mo Han looked up and saw that the main seat in the hall was empty, giving him a bad feeling.

He turned to look at Zhan Yan.

"Old bastard, what's the meaning of this Nine Peaks Bell?"

The Nine Peaks Bell's nine tolls concerned the life and death of the entire Sky Crafting Cave. They dared not neglect it and immediately put down their work to rush over.

Before Zhan Yan could answer, Mo Han frowned deeply.

"Where are Zhou Yuande and Bao Yan?"

"Zhou Yuande has already been hammered to death by my disciple."

This statement shocked everyone, and they subconsciously looked at Xu Yunfan, who was standing beside Zhan Yan, looking somewhat distracted.

Zhan Yan poked Xu Yunfan's arm with his elbow and coughed lightly. "I'm not good with words, you explain it again."

Xu Yunfan had no choice but to step forward and recount the story once more.

Sparks of electricity suddenly shot from Mo Han's bronze prosthesis. He whipped his head around to look at Zhan Yan, and the特有的敏銳 of a mechanism master allowed him to grasp the key point instantly. "You said Zhou Yuande worshipped the Bright Lord of the Incense Fire Cult to seek immortality??"

A few 'haha' sounds rumbled in his throat, feeling it was absurd.

Mo Han could no longer hold back and suddenly burst into laughter. "That old不死, doesn't he know that the Bright Lord also sought immortality, which is why he became a statue that can't move or think, only able to possess people in dreams?"

But he also understood that there was a high probability that what Xu Yunfan said was true. Zhou Yuande of the External Affairs Hall was dead, Bao Yan, the head of the Hidden Blade Pavilion, was missing, and Sect Master Hong Baichuan was not responding.

His expression quickly turned grave. "If this is true, then most of the轮值 disciples in the Sky Crafting Cave are probably dead. This matter passed through my hands, how could I not know? Where did the error occur?"

This was a major problem, a fatal loophole.

The Sky Crafting City had countless mechanisms, and its early warning mechanism had been perfected over a thousand years to be almost flawless, yet it had been infiltrated into a sieve without a sound.

Which link had gone wrong?

Even if there were insiders, it shouldn't have been possible to switch the disciples without anyone noticing. At the very least, yesterday was normal.

A crimson light suddenly lit up on the玄铁鸢 eye on Mo Han's chest.

The mechanical giant bird clinging to the roof of the Sky Crafting Hall suddenly moved. The mechanical bird, its wings wrapped in iron, had a wingspan of thirty feet. As it flapped its wings, it shot up through the opened roof of the Sky Crafting Hall. Its tail feathers left a purple trail in the clouds, and a black line was actually trailing from its belly, connected to the Sky Crafting Hall's roof.

Kite flying?

Xu Yunfan watched in amazement. Although he had imagined that the mechanisms of the Mechanism Hall would be神奇, he hadn't thought they would be this神奇.
