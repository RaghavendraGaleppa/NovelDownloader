# Chapter 93: Fortune's Blessing [Patron Bonus Chapter]

Let's set aside Han Xin's acquisition of the [Heart Demon Curse] for now.

Through the secret treasure [Linked Hearts], he had actually obtained a mythical-grade supreme divine ability from Wubing?

This supposedly weak and clumsy bear from the Iron-Eater Clan's combat roster actually possessed an innate Fortune Dao Seed and was a child of destiny?

Han couldn't help but ask himself:

Between man and bear, who was the true protagonist?

Was he just some hardworking laborer recruited by the Heavenly Dao to assist the child of destiny?

Thankfully, he possessed the [Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws] to stabilize his fortune and had numerous supreme divine abilities to protect himself.

Otherwise, wouldn't he have been completely taken advantage of by this bear?

Han carefully analyzed the situation. If he hadn't possessed multiple supreme divine abilities, there would have been no way he could have extracted [Fortune] from Wubing.

Had he offered an ordinary divine ability, at best he would have only obtained [Iron-Eater] or [Nose Divinity].

Those would have been worlds apart from the innate [Fortune] Dao Seed!

In that case, although he would have gained a child of destiny as a spirit beast companion to smooth his path forward, how could that compare to becoming the child of destiny himself? This was far more satisfying.

With the [Fortune] Dao Seed now in his possession, Han felt much less resentment about the arrangements concerning Wubing and Wuyou.

In fact, he even felt a twinge of guilt for having used the [Heart Demon Curse] to manipulate Wubing and turn it into his vessel.

This feeling was akin to buying a pancake from a street vendor who suddenly ran off with his cart before payment could be made.

Naturally, one would feel a slight pang of guilt while eating that pancake.

Han had already decided that he would grant Wubing full autonomy under the [Pure Yang Dao Heart Curse] and would never restrict its growth.

What Han didn't know was that the three spirit beast slots granted by Elder Chuanzong to the Iron-Eater Clan's direct disciples came with conditions.

Only Iron-Eater Beasts possessing innate supreme divine abilities could use these slots to receive a fourth-grade [Linked Hearts] treasure.

Only the most elite Iron-Eater Beasts qualified for selection.

At the same time, being chosen by the Iron-Eater Clan was itself an opportunity for the direct disciples. The previous two hosts of Iron-Eater Beasts had both achieved immortality.

Even if Han had consulted Elder Chuanzong or Li Changle, they would have undoubtedly agreed.

Had Han not left so quickly, Wuyou would have explained all this to him openly.

Who could have predicted he would flee so decisively!

Now that everything was settled, Han could only fly back to Iron-Eater City along the same route.

Returning to the beast quarters in Iron-Eater City, he found Wuyou and Wubing still waiting there.

Wubing was currently in deep meditation, having just obtained the [Pure Yang Dao Heart Curse] and was working hard to assimilate it.

Seeing Han return, Wuyou smiled and said:

"Fellow Daoist Yuanchu, you're truly cautious! You didn't even let me finish speaking earlier."

"Our Iron-Eater Clan harbors no ill intentions!"

"Moreover, although my younger sibling's current strength is lacking, having awakened the innate [Fortune] Dao Seed makes it a first-rate prodigy. It certainly won't disgrace you!"

Han nodded reluctantly, pretending nothing had happened, and patiently waited for Wubing to awaken from its meditation.

Although he had temporarily accepted this forced relationship, Han remained wary of Wuyou, this third-grade great demon.

Now that their relationship was established, Han could feel the connection between himself and Wubing gradually strengthening.

The spirit contract forged by the immortal treasure [Linked Hearts] was of the highest grade.

As the auras of man and beast intertwined, it would progressively enhance both their magical power and physical strength.

Currently, Han felt his magical power had increased by about ten percent, with an even greater boost to his physical strength.

The benefits from Wubing were becoming increasingly apparent.

These enhancements to magical and physical strength would continue to grow as they spent more time together!

Before long, Wubing leapt up from its meditation.

Excitedly, it said to Han:

"Master, your divine curse is incredible! My spiritual sense has doubled! There are many other marvelous uses I haven't fully grasped yet, but it's definitely an extremely powerful supreme divine ability. I'm very satisfied!"

Compared to Wubing's other abilities besides [Fortune], the [Pure Yang Dao Heart Curse] was indeed far superior.

Wuyou addressed the pair:

"The two of you have now formed a spirit contract. You must help each other and ascend the immortal path together!"

"Wubing is blessed with fortune. The most important things for it are to avoid laziness and greed, and to focus on improving its mental cultivation."

"As for Fellow Daoist Yuanchu, being a direct disciple of the sect leader, you certainly don't lack guidance. I won't waste words. From now on, Wubing will follow your lead. Please mentor it well."

"Regarding the details of this contract, I will send letters to Elder Chuanzong and Sect Leader Tianyun to explain. I ask for your understanding, Fellow Daoist Yuanchu."

With that, Wuyou departed, leaving Han alone with Wubing.

Han immediately put on a stern face and demanded:

"Tell me, when did you start plotting against me?"

Wubing hastily defended itself:

"Master, how can you call this plotting?"

"Although I may not be particularly capable, everyone in Iron-Eater City knows I'm honest and simple!"

"Master, you've completely misunderstood me!"

Han secretly activated the [Heart Demon Curse], imposing a compulsion against lying. The plump bear immediately changed its tune and began spilling the truth.

It turned out that ever since awakening its [Fortune] ability, Wubing had known it would eventually need to find a Shenxiao Palace disciple as a host.

Rather than leaving it to sect assignment, Wubing trusted the guidance from its [Fortune] Dao Seed more.

This was an ineffable intuition that allowed Wubing to receive divine assistance or escape danger at critical moments!

After reaching the second grade, Wubing had frequently wandered around Golden Blade Gorge until it caught Han's scent.

During their brief interaction, Wubing's usually dormant [Fortune] Dao Seed had given unusually clear guidance!

For Wubing, who had possessed the Dao Seed for years, this was extremely rare!

Its subsequent actions—using the [Linked Hearts] treasure to forcibly contract with Han and exchange divine abilities—all followed the Dao Seed's guidance.

Wubing firmly believed this was the best choice for both itself and Han!

Listening to Wubing's explanation, Han couldn't shake the feeling that this was fate!

Examining the [Fortune] Dao Seed floating in his sea of consciousness, Han felt genuine awe toward this mythical-grade power of destiny!

His current cultivation was still too low to fully comprehend this power far beyond his level.

He couldn't even determine whether he had coincidentally obtained the [Fortune] Dao Seed or if the seed had actively chosen him—chosen the [Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws]!

However, at this moment, with so little information, further speculation was pointless.

The path of cultivation lay in the present!

Han only needed to strengthen his Dao heart and persevere steadfastly. No matter what tribulations he faced, he was confident he could overcome them!

Upon careful consideration, the entire contract process with Wubing had been full of surprises.

But ultimately, he hadn't suffered any losses—in fact, he'd gained tremendously.

He adjusted his attitude toward Wubing. This panda was a treasure blessed by fortune and deserved good treatment.

With the [Heart Demon Curse] in place, there was no fear of betrayal.

From now on, man and bear would be united, with double fortune blessings. It sounded quite promising indeed!

After exchanging much information, Han gained a better understanding of the Golden Blade Lake area.

As night fell, both man and bear entered meditation.

The enhancements from the spirit beast continuously flowed into Han.

His soul felt extraordinarily vibrant, as if the spark of golden core formation could ignite at any moment.

But knowing his magical power reserves weren't sufficient yet, he simply allowed this golden core intent to brew within his soul, waiting for the optimal moment to erupt.

He focused inward to comprehend his two newly acquired divine abilities.

Once learned, the [Heart Demon Curse] required no further cultivation—it only needed enough cursed vessels.

Each additional vessel would slightly strengthen Han's [Heart Demon Curse].

This ability was deeply bound to Han's soul.

Enhancing the [Heart Demon Curse] would directly strengthen his spiritual sense and expand his sea of consciousness.

However, Han's spiritual sense already far exceeded his magical power.

For the sake of his immortal path, he needed to devote all his energy to magical cultivation!

Conversely, he needed to be more cautious with the [Heart Demon Curse].

Han continued contemplating his divine abilities, pouring all his focus into the [Fortune] Dao Seed.

This was his second golden ability. Having just witnessed the [Fortune] Dao Seed's peculiar power, Han was extremely cautious.

Unlike the [Golden Light Flight Technique], perhaps due to insufficient cultivation, the [Fortune] Dao Seed seemed completely unusable.
