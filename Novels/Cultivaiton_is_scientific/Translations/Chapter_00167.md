# Chapter 167: Dance of the Soul

The Nine Peaks, now devoid of their protective sect formation, still stood as magnificently as ever. The natural array formed by the peaks, their towering heights piercing the clouds, and the mist swirling between the mountains gave the place an innate aura of an immortal's abode.

Elder Zang surveyed the Nine Peaks with satisfaction. Though the Tianhai Sect might not have been impressive, they had certainly maintained their sect grounds well.

"This central peak shall serve as our main sect peak. Distribute the remaining eight peaks among yourselves and send a team to clear them out!" Elder Zang's aged voice rang out as he pointed to the central peak.

Following his orders, the formation masters and a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Mingxin Sect entered the Nine Peaks to begin clearing out the remnants of the previous occupants.

Naturally, the priority was the central peak—it needed to be cleared first to accommodate Elder Zang.

The Mingxin Sect cultivators, especially the formation masters, were particularly excited. The Tianhai Sect had left in such haste that their sect formation remained almost entirely intact.

This wasn't surprising. With no formation masters left in the Tianhai Sect, dismantling the sect formation was no simple task. Without expert guidance, it would have taken far longer than the six hours Elder Zang had given them—time he hadn't been willing to spare.

"Elder, it seems the Tianhai Sect was wise enough to leave the formation intact. Reconstructing our own formation here will be much easier now," a Golden Core cultivator said with a smile.

"Your vision is too narrow," Elder Zang replied without much enthusiasm. "Even if we took over the entire Tianhai Island, its resources wouldn't amount to a third of what we had in Northern Shu. I won't live to see it, but I hope one of you can reach the Nascent Soul stage and lead our sect back there."

The seven sects of Tianhai Island had cultivated here for ten thousand years without producing a single Nascent Soul cultivator—a testament to the meager quality of resources here. If the Mingxin Sect settled here permanently, their decline would be inevitable.

Elder Zang himself had less than a century left. No matter how he clung to life, he couldn't protect the sect beyond that. If no Golden Core cultivator ascended to Nascent Soul within that time, their hopes of returning to Northern Shu would be lost forever.

By then, the Mingxin Sect would simply become another of the seven sects, slowly withering away on Tianhai Island.

The Golden Core cultivators, chastened by Elder Zang's words, bowed their heads in shame. After their long flight for survival, they had grown complacent in their new refuge, forgetting they were still refugees.

"You are right, Elder," they murmured in unison.

As the formation masters and Foundation Establishment cultivators worked to clear the Nine Peaks, a sudden flash of light illuminated the hall of the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion on Dui Peak. A graceful figure materialized within the formation's glow.

It was Aunt Song, clad in white mourning robes, her head covered with a white scarf. Her face bore a smile as she sensed the approaching Foundation Establishment cultivators. Through hidden formations, she could also perceive the gathering of numerous cultivators across the peaks.

"Cultivation... Without you, where is the immortality in this world?" Her laughter carried the weight of tears.

The hall still seemed to carry traces of Zhuge Xuan's presence. In her mind's eye, she could still see him studying formations with her, recalling their vows to live and die together, to grow old side by side.

Both had forsaken marriage in pursuit of the Golden Core stage, placing their hopes in Elder Yin and Elder Ren, who had married after reaching Golden Core and successfully bore two daughters—both with Heavenly Spiritual Roots.

While conceiving at the Golden Core stage was difficult, any offspring were likely to inherit their parents' superior spiritual roots—after all, no cultivator who reached Golden Core had poor aptitude.

How Aunt Song had longed to don bridal robes and become Zhuge Xuan's wife. Instead, she now wore mourning attire, preparing to avenge him.

Li Shiming hadn't received the Tianhai Sect's evacuation notice—Aunt Song had seen to that, blocking his identity token in her fury. Why had he survived when Zhuge Xuan had perished beside him? And why had the Mingxin Sect of Northern Shu taken Zhuge Xuan's life?

Unable to exact revenge directly, she had chosen to stay behind.

Aunt Song was a high-level formation master. In the sect's final year, she had overseen the sect formation and been granted access to numerous formation resources to strengthen it. During this time, she had made certain... adjustments, embedding special formations within the nodes of the Nine Peaks' grand array.

A high-level formation master, armed with a sect formation—she would see how many Mingxin Sect cultivators she could take down with these tools and her lifelong knowledge, all to avenge Zhuge Xuan.

She laughed freely now, for the first time since hearing of Zhuge Xuan's death. Above her, the starlit sea of formations surged, and the dormant sect formation abruptly flared to life.

At the sect's main spiritual vein, a diversion formation channeled all spiritual energy into the sect formation, enabling its rapid activation.

"What's happening?" a startled Golden Core cultivator exclaimed, staring at the Nine Peaks.

Elder Zang's formidable divine sense swept across the peaks. He hadn't anticipated any cultivators remaining hidden within.

"Someone actually stayed behind? A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator seeks death!" he sneered.

A strand of his divine sense lashed toward Aunt Song's body. The pseudo-Nascent Soul's power would obliterate her instantly.

But Aunt Song had already abandoned her physical form. Her entire soul merged with the starlit sea of formations, becoming one with the sect formation.

At her Foundation Establishment level, she could sustain this fusion for only five breaths before her soul dissipated and her consciousness faded forever.

Her body, now an empty shell, was torn apart by Elder Zang's divine sense, reduced to a mist of blood.

Elder Zang's expression darkened. Though he had destroyed the woman's body, her soul remained. He could still sense her presence.

Then, within the glowing formations of the Nine Peaks, a beautiful figure materialized—Aunt Song, now clad in phantom bridal robes of blood-red, dancing gracefully amidst the formations.

Every movement sent violent surges of spiritual energy rippling through the sect formation.

Every Mingxin Sect cultivator within the formation was now trapped.

The formation masters among them paled as they watched the spectral woman.

"I offer my soul's annihilation to avenge my husband. Zhuge Xuan, I'm coming!" Aunt Song whispered as she danced.

Fused with the sect formation, her soft words reached every cultivator's ears with perfect clarity.

In her mind, a man appeared beside her, smiling, dressed in crimson wedding robes.

Her joy swelled. She laughed loudly, dancing with abandon.

Five breaths—an instant to most, but a lifetime to some.

In those five breaths, Elder Zang attempted to destroy Aunt Song's manifestation. But short of a full-force strike, even he couldn't instantly breach the sect formation.

After all, this formation had been reinforced by countless masters over ten thousand years—far stronger than the formation at Seven Stars Island.

Elder Zang couldn't afford to unleash his full power. Doing so would drastically shorten his remaining lifespan, and these trapped cultivators weren't worth that sacrifice.

So long as he lived, the sect endured. If he fell, the Mingxin Sect would decline to middling strength, perhaps unable to withstand retaliation from the seven sects.

Five breaths later, the sect formation erupted in blinding white light. Terrifying spiritual energy scoured the formation, shredding everything within.

Foundation Establishment cultivators and formation masters alike were torn apart, just as Aunt Song's body had been.

The light faded. Aunt Song's figure vanished, yet her laughter seemed to linger in the air.

"Who was Zhuge Xuan? And who was that woman?" Elder Zang asked the intelligence officer beside him, ignoring the rescue efforts in the Nine Peaks.

"Zhuge Xuan was a high-level formation master of the Tianhai Sect. The woman was Song Yingwan, also a high-level formation master. Zhuge Xuan was reportedly killed by Elder Yun about a year ago," the officer reported.

"To think Song Yingwan would go to such lengths for Zhuge Xuan," Elder Zang mused, shaking his head.

Though Song Yingwan had dealt the Mingxin Sect significant losses, Elder Zang couldn't help but respect her resolve.

Most cultivators acted out of self-interest. Yet Song Yingwan had sacrificed her very soul to avenge Zhuge Xuan.

"Has Yun Xingyi still not been found?" Elder Zang asked suddenly.

"No. It's likely..." The officer trailed off, but Elder Zang understood.

He sighed. Yun Xingyi had been the sect's most promising candidate for Nascent Soul.

"Once we've secured all sect territories, prioritize finding Yun Xingyi," Elder Zang ordered. Turning to the returning Golden Core cultivators, he asked, "Casualties?"

"Fifty-six Foundation Establishment cultivators, twenty-one junior formation masters, six intermediate formation masters, and one high-level formation master," came the quiet reply, as if speaking softly might lessen the blow.

Elder Zang's heart ached. A high-level formation master lost—such treasures were rare.

The Mingxin Sect had never excelled in formations. Their inheritance in Northern Shu had been mediocre, and they'd already lost one formation master during their flight. Now only three high-level formation masters remained.

"What is that?" a Golden Core cultivator suddenly exclaimed, pointing into the distance.

Few things could startle a Golden Core cultivator. Two hundred li from the Nine Peaks, a strange object was ascending, trailing a long fiery tail.

"Elder, let me intercept it!" a mid-Golden Core cultivator offered.

Whatever it was, if it came from Tianhai Sect territory, it was their business.

Besides, the object didn't seem particularly threatening—likely some sort of flying artifact.

The Golden Core cultivator transformed into a streak of light, racing toward the distant object.

To modern eyes, the object would be instantly recognizable—a rocket.

This was Li Shiming's long-prepared escape vehicle. In his previous life, rockets had been the fastest means of travel.

The principles were simple; the challenge lay in materials.

The rocket's fuel was liquid hydrogen. While chemical processes could produce gaseous hydrogen, sub-zero temperatures were required to liquefy it—a feat Li Shiming achieved using formations.

The rocket's body was ordinary steel enhanced with basic fortification runes—more than sufficient when combined with the material's inherent properties.

The true challenge had been the engine. In his past life, engine materials had been a major hurdle. Here, spirit metals provided the perfect solution.

The entire engine assembly comprised multiple low-grade magical artifacts, meticulously arranged in his mental space with micron-level precision and additional enchantments.

The rocket's nose housed a flying boat equipped with air-resistance reduction formations.

The Qianlong Trading Company had provided significant assistance, though they'd never guessed the purpose behind Li Shiming's peculiar orders.

This rocket embodied his research philosophy—merging modern science with the knowledge of formations and enchantments.

It had been a monumental project. For a long time, his clone's primary task had been producing liquid hydrogen.

Originally, Li Shiming had envisioned more than just an escape vehicle—he'd wanted to develop long-range ballistic rockets.

But with his current production capabilities, while the rocket bodies were feasible (if expensive), the liquid hydrogen production was too labor-intensive without better automation.

After learning of his sect's abandonment, he'd prepared the launch site at Eagle Beak Island.

As the rocket ignited, flames engulfed the area before his cave, reducing the spirit bamboo and crops to ash.

The mountain-protecting formation opened a gap. The rocket soared through, then the formation shuddered. Eagle Beak Island's mountain and cave collapsed, sinking beneath the waves as the formation submerged with it.
