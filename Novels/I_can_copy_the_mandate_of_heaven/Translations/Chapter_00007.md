## Chapter 7: A Sudden Change

The sun was beating down on the village, and Slytherin Li Zhiming was visiting the village blacksmith, a widowed middle-aged man with incredibly strong muscles. Despite his tough life, the blacksmith worked hard every day, repairing pots and agricultural tools for the villagers. Li Zhiming saw the blacksmith's personal fate and skills, but unlike his father's, they didn't seem to rub off on him easily. The blacksmith's fate was marked as "Widowed and Alone," and his skill was listed as "Blacksmith 5: Simple repairs and crafting of basic tools and simple blades, but unfortunately, there's no one to use them."

Undeterred, Li Zhiming visited the blacksmith every month, watching and learning from him. He'd sit by the furnace, watching the blacksmith hammer away, and gradually, the blacksmith began to warm up to him. The villagers, though many in number, rarely visited the blacksmith; children, especially, kept their distance.

Two weeks later, Li Zhiming finally managed to see and copy the blacksmith's skills: 

Skill, Blacksmith 5: You can simply repair pots and all agricultural tools. ... Guard dropped, conditions met, copyable.

The line of text reappeared, and Li Zhiming was ecstatic. He quickly copied the skill to himself, and in just a month of watching the blacksmith, he had mastered his expertise. 

Emboldened, Li Zhiming visited the village's barefoot doctor, Ni Daren, at the cattle pen. He followed him to gather herbs before dawn and watched him dry them in the afternoon. It didn't take long; in less than half a month, Ni Daren grew fond of the young boy, and Li Zhiming managed to copy his basic medical skills and some herbal knowledge.

However, Li Zhiming soon realized that he had reached the limit of his village. There were hardly any people with remarkable skills or good fate. In less than two months, he had become one of the best in the village at farming, blacksmithing, and basic medicine.

Despite his exceptional abilities, Li Zhiming's own fate remained unchanged. His personal fate was still marked as "Petty Rich Peasant." No matter how hard he tried, it seemed he couldn't change it.

Li Zhiming pondered his future. Even if he grew up and left the village, what could he achieve? At best, he could try to find someone with a remarkable "spiritual root" and copy it. 

The current Li Zhiming couldn't think that far ahead. 

As time passed, Li Zhiming grew stronger. One day, while playing in the courtyard with a wooden sword, his father, Li Chujiu, returned from the mountains. 

"Ah, kiddo," Li Chujiu called out, entering the courtyard with a contented smile. He was carrying something behind his back.

Li Zhiming stopped playing and looked up at his father. 

Li Chujiu took out a small animal, a grey and white creature with its limbs and mouth bound. 

The kid's eyes widened in excitement. 

The animal was a small beast, likely a fruit badger. 

Li Chujiu mentioned it was caught in a trap meant for a wild boar. He planned to let Li Zhiming play with it for a few days before skinning it to sell.

Li Zhiming eagerly wanted to keep the creature as a pet. 

Li Chujiu sat down, smoking his pipe, enjoying the scene of his children playing together.

As they interacted, a group of riders on fine horses and dressed in luxurious clothing arrived at the outskirts of the village. They seemed to observe the small village quietly.
