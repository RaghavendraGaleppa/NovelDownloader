# Chapter 17: Fist Imprint  

Carrying a fully loaded book basket on his back, Zhou Qing returned to his small courtyard, where Mao Ri greeted him with outstretched wings and a series of clucks.  

This oversized bird was clearly no ordinary creature. Left alone in the courtyard, it required no attention from Zhou Qing. Even if it wandered off, it would always find its way back.  

Having someone—or something—waiting at home was a comforting feeling, even if that someone was just a chicken. A peculiar sense of peace settled in Zhou Qing's heart.  

On the other hand, having shed the responsibility of being a tutor, he felt both relief and an inexplicable sense of loss.  

"I wonder if Miss Lin's maid, Chunxiang, has been taking the Five-Spice Pills continuously. Has the effect shown yet?"  

He distracted himself with other thoughts before finally turning his focus inward. He began organizing the mountain goods and copper coins, neatly arranging them in the storage room, while the cured meats he had brought back were placed in the kitchen.  

The supplies he had stockpiled in the storage room over these past days were enough to sustain him for two to three years under normal circumstances. However, if he were to dedicate himself fully to martial training, they would only last until the start of the prefectural academy's term.  

The expenses of martial training were like a bottomless pit. If he wanted to eat well and not deprive himself, the costs would multiply exponentially.  

"I still need to keep making money."  

---  

Driven by a growing sense of urgency, Zhou Qing didn't allow himself any rest after finishing his chores. He first devoured a cured chicken, a bowl of rice, and a small basin of vegetables. Once the food had settled, he prepared to devote the remaining time of the day to training.  

Though the shade under the large mulberry tree provided some relief, the summer heat grew more oppressive with each passing day. Feeling the warmth, Zhou Qing removed his upper garment and used the reflection in the well water to examine the results of his recent efforts.  

His once gaunt frame had visibly filled out.  

Practicing *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart* on the wooden dummy these past few days, Zhou Qing could clearly feel the increased strength in his right arm and the improvement in its durability. Yet, the more he trained, the more he sensed an invisible bottleneck approaching.  

Pondering the reason, he realized his body hadn't fully matured yet. The strength of his right arm would soon hit a ceiling, dictated by the limits of his skeletal structure. As his body continued to develop, this ceiling would rise, but it would never match those with innate talent.  

How, then, could he enhance his combat ability?  

Technique?  

Zhou Qing understood that technique could compensate for strength to a certain extent, but ultimately, power was the foundation.  

For now, there was no other way. He had to refine his martial skills using the wooden dummy to maximize their effectiveness in potential real combat situations.  

"*Black Tiger Plucks the Heart!*"  

With each repetition, Zhou Qing's strength grew incrementally, allowing him to gradually unleash his full potential.  

---  

Throughout this process, Zhou Qing paid meticulous attention to the engagement of his muscles, leaving no room for error. Only by perfecting every detail in training could he minimize mistakes in moments of crisis.  

Since the emergence of his *Literary Courage*, every training session had become an exercise in intense focus.  

This state reminded him of the final sprint before the imperial examinations—so absorbed in each piece of knowledge that even if a girl he secretly admired walked past his desk, he wouldn't glance up.  

Of course, back in his first year, he had also been so engrossed in novels that he found it irritating when girls would find excuses to approach him during breaks.  

Fortunately, in this secluded courtyard, no one disturbed him.  

As for Mao Ri, it always kept its distance whenever Zhou Qing practiced the Tiger Play or Black Tiger Fist. Its tiny chicken eyes even held a trace of reverence.  

If Mao Ri possessed human-like intelligence, it might have thought, *The Tiger King has taken human form—what terrifying cultivation! Only such a mighty demon is worthy of my allegiance.*  

As Zhou Qing continued his relentless training, the execution of *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart* became increasingly instinctive.  

He practiced tirelessly until, at one point, his stamina was completely depleted. With one final punch, he struck the marked heart position on the wooden dummy—protected by a sheet of iron.  

When he withdrew his fist, a clear, sunken imprint was left behind.  

Zhou Qing's mind blanked for a moment.  

Then, sweat poured uncontrollably from his body, and his right fist swelled, turning a deep red.  

*It hurts!*  

The sharp pain made him instinctively clutch his fist with his left hand as he crouched down.  

After a while, the pain subsided slightly.  

Zhou Qing turned his attention to the *Preservation of Life* interface in his mind:  

**Five Animals Play (Proficient):**  
- Tiger Play (Mastered)  
- Deer Play (Skilled)  
- Bear Play (Proficient)  
- Bird Play (Proficient)  
- Monkey Play (Proficient)  

**Martial Techniques:**  
- *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart* (Mastered)  
- *Flicking Finger Divine Skill* (Proficient)  

**Literary Courage (Initial Stage).**  
**Remaining Lifespan: 35 years.**  

A sudden epiphany struck him—his understanding of *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart* had deepened significantly. Perhaps even Blacksmith Hu's comprehension of the technique couldn't surpass his own now.  

"First, practice the Tiger Play to heal the damage to my right hand."  

Zhou Qing gulped down several large bowls of cool water and a spoonful of honey to quickly replenish his fluids and energy.  

Then, he skillfully applied a bruise-dispelling ointment to his right hand before performing the eight forms of the Tiger Play. The familiar warmth soon arose, synergizing with the ointment's effects to rapidly repair the damage.  

Clenching his right fist, he felt an innate sense of resilience surge within him.  

---  

Clearly, his right hand had reached a new level of strength.  

Picking up a pebble, he flicked it with his finger. The stone struck the thick trunk of the mulberry tree with precision, leaving a deeper mark than before.  

A spark of delight flashed in Zhou Qing's eyes.  

The power of his *Flicking Finger Divine Skill* was now nothing to scoff at—a direct result of his right hand's enhanced conditioning.  

Next, he executed *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart* through the air. A crisp *snap* rang out, accompanied by a faint ripple in the surrounding air.  

The entire motion was executed with flawless fluidity.  

While the increased power of *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart* was satisfying, what pleased Zhou Qing more was how the technique had become almost instinctive.  

The moment the thought arose, his body responded like a pre-programmed mechanism, unleashing the full force of the technique with a resounding punch.  

He was utterly confident that even in a sudden crisis, he could instinctively deploy *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart* with nearly the same effectiveness as during training.  

"Logically, there should be a bottleneck after *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart* reaches the peak of proficiency. Yet, when I broke through, it felt as though no such barrier existed. This must be due to the influence of *Literary Courage*, much like how it aided the Tiger Play's advancement to mastery."  

Zhou Qing began to suspect that *Literary Courage* might allow the other four animal plays—and even the *Flicking Finger Divine Skill*—to progress smoothly to the mastered stage without encountering bottlenecks.  

He ventured a bold hypothesis: *Literary Courage* might possess the ability to bypass cultivation bottlenecks entirely.  

However, his *Literary Courage* was still only at the initial stage.  

Its advancement seemed tied to the wisdom in the sage texts he recalled from memory, but Zhou Qing hadn't yet composed another piece as emotionally rich as *Admonitions to My Son*, making it impossible to verify his theory further.  

Regardless, mastering *Black Tiger Plucks the Heart* had given Zhou Qing another means of survival beyond his scholarly title.  

Gazing at the sunken fist imprint on the iron-clad heart of the wooden dummy, Zhou Qing felt a fraction of his unease and anxiety about the approaching chaos of the world dissipate, replaced by a renewed confidence in the future.  

"Not enough. Far from enough."  

The stronger he became, the fiercer his desire to grow even stronger burned.
