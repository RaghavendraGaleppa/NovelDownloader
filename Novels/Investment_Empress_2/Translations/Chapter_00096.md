# Chapter 96: Business is Booming, Who Says a Hero Must Stand in the Light?

“Xiao Er, your restaurant's hotpot is so delicious. Did you add some illegal or illicit ingredients?”

“I'll have another plate of beef over here!”

“Do you offer delivery?”

...

“Coming, coming!”

Xiao Qin was spinning like a top inside the restaurant. He never imagined that when Junior Brother Li said he wanted to open a hotpot restaurant, he was actually serious about it.

While serving dishes, he asked inwardly:

“Master, did Junior Brother Li really put something illegal in the hotpot? Otherwise, why is it so fragrant?”

“My precious disciple, I need to discuss something with you.”

“Please go ahead.”

“Regarding the question you just asked, I need to borrow your body to taste it myself to find out.”

The Thousand-Form Martial Venerable could possess Xiao Qin for a short time, but this method consumed a great deal of spiritual will.

Xiao Qin: “...”

He felt that when he had time, he should talk to Junior Brother Li.

There was no need to make the hotpot this delicious.

It had only been open for three days, and the place was already packed. If this continued, wouldn't there be a line outside the door in a few days?

He strongly suspected that Junior Brother Li's real intention behind proposing this plan was simply to open a hotpot restaurant.

“Boss Lady, the bill.”

At the counter.

The boss lady was a woman with an ordinary face but exceptionally beautiful eyes.

Her abacus clicked rapidly under her fingers, and the clay jar beside her was already filled with broken silver.

Ying Bing lowered her gaze, looking at the money they had earned. Her clear, bright eyes flashed with a hint of pleasure.

At first, she had found Li Mo's plan somewhat absurd.

But counting this silver, which meant nothing to her personally, gave her a strange sense of immersive satisfaction.

Is this what an ordinary person's life is like?

“Bing Daozi, you've already counted the money four times.”

Li Mo, twisting the fake beard on his lip, said helplessly.

“I don't like making mistakes.” Ying Bing's fingers paused for a moment before she continued counting.

“...Fine.”

As long as Bing Daozi didn't go into the kitchen, she could count as many times as she wanted.

Li Mo retracted his gaze and observed the diners coming and going.

The Providence Divine Eye was perpetually active. He picked up a pen and began recording on a piece of paper.

**[Name: Luo Feiyan]**
**[Age: 27]**
**[Bones: Crane Wing Arms, Cat Feet.]**
**[Realm: Inner Qi Condensation Realm.]**
**[Providence: Green with a hint of Black.]**
**[Evaluation: Outstanding lightness skill, a famous female thief. She loves stealing other people's important items, only to silently return them later. Having stolen a "Swallow Before the Hall," she has decided to join the excitement in Ziyang Prefecture.]**
**[Recent Events: Just stole the secret manual of He Bin, the Sand-Shifting Blade. She has already been targeted by him.]**

...

This was his record of the slender woman currently dipping food into the hotpot.

Before her, there was another record:

**[Name: Luo Yao]**
**[Age: 14]**
**[Bones: Falling Goose Hands, Purple Star Eyes.]**
**[Realm: 12th Pulse of the Blood Qi Realm.]**
**[Providence: Blue with a hint of Black.]**
**[Evaluation: Disciple of the Burning Jade Valley. Exceptional talent, full of youthful spirit. She secretly stole her family's famous heirloom, the Gentleman Brush, and ran away from home to roam the Jianghu.]**
**[Recent Events: Being targeted by the Night Ghost Liu Heng, who intends to seize her Gentleman Brush to present to the Rain Pavilion's Soul-Executing Judge.]**

Li Mo raised his head and looked not far away.

There, in the hall, sat a handsome young man with red lips and white teeth, dressed in splendid brocade, looking heroic and valiant.

To put it simply, this girl must have read too many storybooks.

She wrapped her chest and tied up her hair, thinking that no one would recognize her as a woman.

At the entrance of the hotpot restaurant, she had even gotten into a dispute, using her brush to snap the weapons of several Jianghu travelers in a single strike, drawing a lot of attention.

She slammed the table and shouted loudly:

“Boss, bring me some wine!”

“I want the strongest kind! This young master is known as 'Thousand Cups Not Drunk, Ten Thousand Cups Not Toppled'!”

It was obvious she was deliberately deepening her voice.

“Coming.”

Watching the girl's face flush crimson, Li Mo silently added a bit more water to the wine.

With this level of drinking capacity, she was still bragging?

She better hope the Fighting King of the Qingyuan Sect doesn't hear her.

“Here, this is your tip.”

The girl ate her hotpot and drank her wine, tossing out a small, pure gold fish ingot.

“Sigh.”

Li Mo sighed softly.

Perhaps for young men and women, the Jianghu is about wine and swords, riding horses, scattering gold, and seeking pleasure and revenge?

Wasn't he the same back in the day?

“Boss, by the way, how did you come up with this hotpot recipe?”

“Any interest in opening a branch in my Burning Jade Valley? My brother is very rich.”

Luo Yao asked, drunk and swaying.

“May I ask who the honorable guest's brother is...”

“The Chief Disciple of Burning Jade Valley, Luo Yu!”

Ah.

No wonder I felt a bit annoyed looking at her.

---

When the Nine脉 Martial Assembly ended, Li Mo had encountered Luo Yu. The other party wanted to trade ten rare treasures, six famous artifacts, and ten thousand taels of gold for his Chixiao Sword.

As is well known.

Little Li has quite a bit of family wealth, so he politely refused.

Do you want to know what Luo Yu said?

“Very well, you have attracted my attention.”

No wonder these two are siblings...

After Luo Yao revealed her background, the number of people staring at her decreased significantly.

“Little sister, could it be that you find the boss handsome and want to take him home?”

A woman's teasing voice came from the side. It was Luo Feiyan.

“I want to challenge you!”

Luo Yao immediately glared at her angrily. Her already flushed face turned even redder.

Luo Feiyan ignored her and instead looked at Li Mo.

“The boss must have been a handsome young man in his youth.”

“I'm quite interested in your...”

Hmm.

Li Mo had used the Invisibility Silk Veil to make himself look older.

At the counter, the sound of the abacus stopped. The boss lady looked up and silently looked at Luo Feiyan.

“Hotpot recipe.” Luo Feiyan finished her sentence.

The sound of the abacus started again.

“Boss, opening one shop is already hard enough!”

Xiao Qin put down a plate of mutton.

Wait, Junior Brother Li, are you actually thinking about the feasibility of this?

We aren't here to make the hotpot restaurant bigger and stronger!

“Hmm, we don't have plans to open a branch for the time being.”

“We won't be selling the hotpot recipe either.”

Li Mo smiled and politely refused Luo Yao and Luo Feiyan.

“Tsk, your chef's knife skills are pretty good.”

Luo Feiyan narrowed her eyes and picked up a slice of mutton as thin as a cicada's wing.

“He's practiced for a few years.”

Li Mo laughed softly.

Yes, he practiced the Unborn Blade Art for a few years.

The mutton he cut was not only as thin as a cicada's wing but also incredibly fresh, preserving the ingredients' freshness to the maximum.

Returning to the counter with the gold fish ingot.

Bing Daozi scraped it into the money jar and started counting again.

As the sky grew darker.

After a busy day, the hotpot restaurant finally closed its doors.

“I gathered some information today.”

“Among the stronger ones are two people: He Bin, the Sand-Shifting Blade, and Liu Heng, the Night Ghost. One is at the Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm, the other at the Inner Qi Xuan Dan Realm.”

“There are also some small fry, mostly at the Inner Qi Condensation Realm. Their combat strength shouldn't be weak; they are all vicious criminals with blood on their hands.”

Li Mo said while looking at the record paper in his hand.

Xiao Qin and Zuoqiu Yang exchanged a glance.

So many participants of the Infinite Trial came to the shop today?

They hadn't noticed at all.

Li Mo continued:

“We must strive for a swift kill. The faster the battle ends, the better.”

“Senior Brother Xiao, Brother Zuoqiu, leave the small fry to you. Your martial arts are quite suited for dealing with small fry.”

Xiao Qin's expression was complicated.

Was this a compliment?

But actually, the "small fry" in Junior Brother Li's mouth weren't weak either; they were all at the Inner Qi Condensation Realm.

He silently put on his night clothes and donned a cow-headed mask bought from the market.

The two slipped out into the darkness.

“Are you going out to perform chivalrous deeds, or are you staying in the shop to wait for me?”

Li Mo turned back and asked.

“Chivalrous deeds?”

Ying Bing didn't quite understand.

They were hiding their heads and tails, sneaking out in the dark.

How could that be related to the word 'chivalry'?

Li Mo said seriously:

“Who says a hero must stand in the light?”

“I have to tell you the story of Gotham City. There is also a knight-errant there.”

“Whenever night falls, he puts on a mask and goes out to fight crime...”

Ten minutes later.

Another figure left the hotpot restaurant.

Watching Li Mo's back disappear into the night.

Ying Bing remained silent for a few seconds.

The story just now was quite childish.

But perhaps because she had never had such an experience before, there was a hint of eagerness deep in her heart.

This was very unusual for her.

“Someone might use the Infinite Trial to make a move against Jiang Chulong.”

“I haven't investigated this matter clearly yet.”

*Swish—*

A leaf outside trembled slightly; someone had stepped on it, their figure moving away.

She was going to investigate the matter regarding Jiang Chulong.

Yes.

That's it...
