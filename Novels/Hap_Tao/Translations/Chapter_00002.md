# Chapter 2: The Scarlet Sky Temple  

Qin Ziling's heart trembled violently upon hearing this, and he even felt his breath grow labored.  

He had only asked the question casually, recalling the ancient well from his nightmare. Never had he imagined that a Scarlet Sky Temple truly existed in reality.  

"Ahem, I just heard someone mention it by chance yesterday and got curious," Qin Ziling lied smoothly, not about to admit it had come from a nightmare.  

Cui Shi didn't dwell on it. With an "Oh," she continued, "The Scarlet Sky Temple is located at the foot of Little Dragon Mountain, about fourteen or fifteen miles from our village. When you were a child, it still had some worshippers. That year your father fell gravely ill, I heard of the temple and even made a special trip there."  

"But these days, the world is in chaos. Bandits and marauders are everywhere, pillaging and killing. Little Dragon Mountain is far from the prefectural city and the main roads, making it a hotbed for bandits. The villagers who lived there were either killed or fled, and most of the villages were looted and destroyed. The Scarlet Sky Temple has long been abandoned."  

At this, Cui Shi seemed to recall something and sighed faintly, unable to conceal her worry.  

Qin Ziling's heart grew heavy. The world was indeed a dangerous place.  

"Mother, Ran Yue, I'm off to the martial arts school," Qin Ziling said after asking a few more questions about Little Dragon Mountain's location. He quickly finished breakfast, grabbed the lunch prepared by Yin Ran Yue, and stood up to leave.  

"Be careful on the road. I heard yesterday that bandits have been spotted near the prefectural city. Just a few days ago, Li Family Village was raided," Cui Shi warned.  

"I will," Qin Ziling nodded before leaving, his heart growing even heavier.  

Li Family Village was only about ten miles from the prefectural city walls and not far from the main road. Logically, it should have been within the protective reach of the city's garrison. The fact that it had been raided was unsettling.  

"It seems the world is truly descending into chaos. Moving into the city would be safer, but without money or strength, how can I possibly manage that?" Qin Ziling mused as he strode along the main road, heading in the opposite direction of the prefectural city. A sense of urgency and helplessness weighed on him.  

For the first five or six miles, the road passed through lively villages, with fields stretching endlessly and farmers working diligently.  

But further on, the landscape changed. Abandoned fields overgrown with weeds and ruined, uninhabited villages became common. The road was now frequented only by merchant caravans guarded by armed escorts and groups of emaciated refugees. Lone travelers were a rare sight.  

After another four or five miles, Qin Ziling turned off the main road onto a narrow path leading to Little Dragon Mountain.  

The path, long untraveled, was choked with weeds and thorns, making the journey difficult. Moreover, the hills and wilderness were rife with bandits.  

Fortunately, Qin Ziling had trained in martial arts and was agile. Traveling alone gave him flexibility, and strangely enough, since his rebirth, his senses had sharpened to an almost supernatural degree. He could keenly detect changes in his surroundings.  

Thus, proceeding cautiously, he managed to spot several bandit ambushes in advance, avoiding the danger of being robbed.  

After more than two hours, Qin Ziling arrived at Little Dragon Mountain unscathed.  

Even before reaching the mountain, he caught a whiff of the chilling wind carrying a foul, rotting stench.  

When he finally stood before Little Dragon Mountain, his heart pounded uncontrollably, and a shiver ran down his spine.  

Several peaks had collapsed, with boulders strewn across the slopes and base. Some rocks, as large as houses, were split cleanly in half, their surfaces smooth as if cleaved by an impossibly sharp blade.  

Worse still, the mountain was littered with putrid, yellowish ooze that reeked of decay. Wherever the ooze had flowed, vegetation had withered and died.  

The sight instantly brought back the nightmare—the two colossal swords, the grotesque old man, and the monstrous bird exploding into a shower of gore. Qin Ziling trembled violently.  

"It's real! Everything in my dream was real! How is this possible? I clearly reincarnated into Qin Ziling's body. How is this connected to that old man?"  

His heart racing, Qin Ziling instinctively scanned his surroundings.  

Soon, his gaze locked onto a dilapidated temple at the mountain's base. A crooked plaque above its entrance bore three characters: "Scarlet Sky Temple."  

Swallowing hard, Qin Ziling suppressed his shock and carefully navigated around the foul-smelling ooze until he reached the temple.  

As his mother had said, the temple was in ruins, with crumbling walls, layers of dust, and cobwebs everywhere.  

Finding nothing remarkable inside, Qin Ziling quickly passed through the main hall into the rear courtyard.  

There, just as expected, stood an ancient well.  

Qin Ziling hurried to the well and peered down.  

The water's surface was covered with dead leaves, obscuring the depths. Yet, inexplicably, he felt something familiar calling to him from below.  

Without further thought, he tested the well rope for sturdiness and began descending.  

If the dream was real, then logically, the old man—who could ride a monstrous bird and was pursued by flying swords—must have been a peerless expert, as were his pursuers.  

In the prefectural city, Qin Ziling had never heard of anyone capable of flying sword techniques. Such abilities belonged to legendary sword immortals.  

Thus, the ring on the old man's finger couldn't be ordinary.  

Given Qin Ziling's current circumstances—his impoverished family and mediocre talent—the ring might be his only hope of surviving this chaotic world.  

Reaching the bottom, he soon spotted the ring embedded in a crevice of the well wall. The severed finger that once bore it was nowhere to be found.  

Qin Ziling pried the ring loose.  

The moment it touched his palm, a profound sense of connection surged through him, as if the ring were part of his flesh and blood. Simultaneously, his mind was flooded with chaotic, fragmented images.  

Most were scenes of bloodshed, depravity, and terror, with the old man from his nightmare as the central figure.  

The images multiplied, growing increasingly disordered.  

His head throbbed as if about to split. Gritting his teeth, he climbed out of the well and collapsed unconscious beside it.  

When he finally awoke, his eyes remained dark and clear, but deep within them flickered a glint of worldly wisdom—along with cunning, malice, and ruthlessness.  

"So, when my soul crossed into this body, the remnant soul of Li Mo, the Sect Master of the Corpse Demon Sect, was attempting to possess it. At the critical moment, my arrival turned me into the fisherman who profited from the clams' quarrel," Qin Ziling deduced after careful thought.  

Not only had he reincarnated from a modern world, but he had also merged with the remnant soul of a demonic sect master.  

Why Li Mo had been slain near Little Dragon Mountain remained a mystery.  

"Good heavens! I've fused with a demon's remnant soul! Does that mean I now possess two souls and one remnant soul? No wonder my senses have sharpened so unnaturally since rebirth—even allowing me to multitask effortlessly."  

With this realization, Qin Ziling understood many of the changes in his body.  

His gaze then fell upon the black ring clutched tightly in his hand.
