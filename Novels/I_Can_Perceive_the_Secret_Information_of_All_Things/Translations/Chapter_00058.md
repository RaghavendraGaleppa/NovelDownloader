# Chapter 58: How Could Someone Who Owns a Mine Have Only One Magical Artifact?

As Xiao Ji's sword incinerated one of the hand-spiders, the remaining arachnid demons retreated upon their king's command, surrounding them from the shadows of nearby trees.

[Hand-Spider King of the Nine Nether Valley: Level 12, Tier 1 demonic beast. Its spider silk is corrosive, conceals deadly flying threads in its mouth, and its tail releases hallucinogenic poison gas...]

Knowing the enemy's trump cards increased their chances of victory by thirty percent. When the time came to fight, Xiao Ji could adjust his tactics based on the actual situation. With their cultivation levels being nearly equal, the odds were favorable.

Xiao Ji's mind raced, quickly formulating several battle plans, though none fully satisfied him. His own techniques were limited—his only ranged attack was sword energy. Against a poison-wielding demonic beast that preferred ambush tactics over direct confrontation, ending the battle quickly would be difficult if the enemy refused to engage head-on.

"Poison defense is key," Xiao Ji concluded.

The Hand-Spider King had stopped less than fifty zhang away, its tail spinning translucent silk that rapidly spread in a wide circle, trapping its prey. The creature was smart enough to cut off their escape routes first.

Xiao Ji could easily escape alone, but he couldn't abandon the wealthy young master beside him. In the cultivation world, betrayal was common—people would stab each other in the back for a magical artifact, a pill, or even a courtesan, let alone in life-or-death situations. But Xiao Ji was different. He still had his humanity, and more importantly, he knew Qian Duoyu's family owned spirit stone mines. How could he abandon a future mine heir to a pack of demonic beasts? Who would inherit those mines then? Where else would he find such a wealthy friend?

He firmly believed himself to be a virtuous Daoist.

Looking at Qian Duoyu, Xiao Ji found him oddly endearing.

[Qian Duoyu's storage gold ring contains spirit rice for fighting cocks, a small spirit dagger for cutting spirit stones, a spirit-measuring caliper...]

"What kind of nonsense are you carrying?"

Then he noticed Qian Duoyu's belt—another storage artifact.

[Storage belt: Contains various hidden weapons...]

His jade pendant was yet another.

[Storage jade pendant: Contains assorted pills...]

And it didn't stop there.

[Storage pouch...]

[Storage longevity gold lock...]

[Storage shoes...]

"You're ridiculously extravagant. How did I not realize this earlier?" Xiao Ji looked at Qian Duoyu with a complicated expression.

Of course—someone from a mining family wouldn't have just one magical artifact. Every item on his body was a storage device, each specialized for different purposes: one for spirit stones, another for pills, another for clothes... It made sense.

The most crucial detail was that Qian Duoyu was only at Qi Refinement Stage Five, while storage artifacts typically required Stage Six to use—a standard set by the Dao Alliance. The only explanation was that his storage artifacts were custom-made, costing far more in cultivation currency.

Being rich truly had its perks.

Unlike his obvious gold storage ring, Qian Duoyu's other artifacts held many valuable items. His jade pendant alone contained hundreds of antidote pills, while his longevity lock housed a spirit-fire artifact capable of burning the Hand-Spider King's silk.

With treasures like these, why waste time with an invisibility cloak?

"With all these goodies, why bother with an invisibility cloak?" Xiao Ji muttered inwardly before approaching Qian Duoyu.

"Daoist Xiao, the spider demons are afraid of us—you scared them off," Qian Duoyu said, only seeing the surface situation.

"They're just hiding in the shadows. They haven't fled. These creatures lack intelligence and don't feel fear like humans do," Xiao Ji explained. "To them, no matter how many I kill, we're still prey. Unless their leader calls them off, they won't give up."

"I see... So what do we do now?" Qian Duoyu grew nervous.

He had little combat experience and no survival skills. At home, everyone indulged him—any danger was swiftly handled by experts eager for rewards from the mine owner. He once adopted a stray cat, only for a swordsman to obliterate it two days later when it meowed at him, claiming, "That cat insulted you—it was a threat." The man then went to collect his reward.

This trip to Taigu City was supposed to be safe—his father had arranged for him to stay within city limits. But Qian Duoyu refused to be caged.

He had demanded freedom, insisting his hidden protectors be withdrawn. His father agreed, but Qian Duoyu knew better—there were undoubtedly still guards lurking.

"My father probably sent experts to protect me in secret. Should I call them out?" Qian Duoyu suggested awkwardly.

"Those six? They were strong, but..." Xiao Ji looked apologetic. "I might have shaken them off. Back in the city."

Qiao Duoyu: "..."

An unestablished cultivator had outmaneuvered Foundation Establishment and Core Formation experts? Yet given the situation, the Daoist's words rang true—if his father's guards were present, they would have slaughtered the spider demons the moment they appeared.

Xiao Ji kept most of his focus on the Hand-Spider King, which had finished its first web at fifty zhang and was now spinning a second layer at thirty zhang. A remarkably cautious creature.

"Don't worry," Xiao Ji reassured. "I'll get us out safely and help you hunt the Skywing Tiger. But first, take two antidote pills from your jade pendant—one for each of us—and two poison-resistance pills. Then fetch the spirit-fire lamp from your longevity lock. We'll need it to burn the webs."

Qian Duoyu's first reaction: "Huh?"

How do I have those things? He stood frozen. "Daoist Xiao, are those... really on me?"

You don't even know your own belongings? Then again, with so many artifacts, it was understandable.

"Follow my instructions. On your right waist, the third red jade pendant—find a white vial inside and take out two blue pills..."

Xiao Ji painstakingly guided someone else through their own possessions.
