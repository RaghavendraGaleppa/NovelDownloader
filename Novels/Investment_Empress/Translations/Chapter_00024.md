# Chapter 24: A Gift in Return, Martial Venerable Thousand Forms' Shock

The next morning.

Li Mo woke up feeling refreshed.

He had only slept for two *shichen* (four hours), yet he still felt full of vigor, his body brimming with strength. Last night, he had cultivated late into the night. In return, his third meridian was only a hair's breadth away from being unblocked. Aside from everything else, his raw strength alone was much greater than before. This was a conclusion he drew when he accidentally snapped a pair of chopsticks while making breakfast.

"The ice block is still cultivating?"

"So diligent, no wonder she can be the Child of Destiny."

Li Mo placed the breakfast in a steamer basket. Just light a fire, warm it up, and it's ready to eat – another small detail. Seriously, was this just breakfast for the ice block? This was all real money, hard-earned investments! Furthermore, given the ice block's Destiny rank, she was highly likely to yield some pleasant surprises for him.

"Details determine success or failure. I'm practically an investment genius."

Little Li happily gave himself this evaluation. He wouldn't even mention his silver now. In his system space, he had five thousand taels of gold alone, plus various precious and rare items. Who knows, they might all be useful in the future. A truly successful investor must understand that even a mosquito's leg is still meat!

"I'll go to Divine Edge Cave this morning and practice Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body." Li Mo mused inwardly. He believed that a powerful physique was just as important as one's cultivation realm. Although Little Li aspired to be a sword master, who said a Sword Saint couldn't build a tanky defense? Furthermore, Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body could enhance his connection with weapons. Once he acquired a good sword in the future, it would allow his sword techniques to unleash even greater power.

Li Mo had just stepped out the door. He hadn't gone far when he encountered a familiar figure. It was Xiao Qin. Although he was still wearing the gray robes of an outer disciple, his entire demeanor had improved significantly; he seemed to have shed all gloom and stood tall with pride. Moreover, the aura around Xiao Qin was much stronger than before.

"Junior Brother Li."

Xiao Qin had clearly been waiting at the entrance of Autumn Water Pavilion for some time. Seeing the door open and Li Mo emerge, he laughed heartily: "Thanks to you, I've regained the ten meridians of the Qi-Blood Realm."

"Then congratulations, Senior Brother Xiao." Li Mo wasn't surprised by this and was quite happy about it. Old Xiao was still a good person; it was good that he could avoid wasting time and see the light of day sooner.

"It's all thanks to Junior Brother's good fortune." Xiao Qin shook his head and said sincerely, "If not for that Profound Crystal from Junior Brother, I fear I would have wasted much more time. This is a life-changing kindness."

"It's good that you've recovered. At this rate, Senior Brother will soon be able to return to the inner sect." Li Mo praised him, completely without doubt. Old Xiao must have already activated the Seven Stars Ancient Pendant. He just didn't know if what was inside was an inheritance, a powerful expert's legacy, or... the powerful expert themselves? In any case, no matter which it was, Xiao Qin's future achievements wouldn't be low.

Just as he was thinking this, suddenly, Li Mo felt a sensation. Someone... was peeking at him? Li Mo's thoughts spun, and he naturally realized. Could it be... Xiao Qin's old grandpa?

"I truly don't know how to repay Junior Brother's kindness in my time of need."

"I've had some recent fortuitous encounters and received a protective amulet from an elder." Xiao Qin took out a golden brocade pouch from his sleeve. Its form was clearly not a product of this era, and its material wasn't ordinary gold thread; even from a distance, one could feel a tranquil and gentle warmth. Hmm, the only minor flaw was that the brocade pouch was strung together with a piece of hemp rope.

"Inside it contains a feather, left by an auspicious beast with a powerful bloodline. It can ward off evil spirits and nourish the physical body."

"Such a good item, doesn't Senior Brother Xiao need it too?" Li Mo probably knew who Old Xiao's "elder" was referring to. It seemed he really had met a powerful hidden expert. No wonder he could produce such an excellent protective treasure.

"Its usefulness isn't as great for me anymore."

"Please, Junior Brother, don't decline," Xiao Qin said somewhat eagerly, seeing his hesitation.

Li Mo understood inwardly but didn't show it on his face. He smiled and took the brocade pouch: "Then I won't be overly courteous. Thank you, Senior Brother Xiao."

When it came to protective treasures, one could never have too many. He was currently practicing Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body, so his physical defense would definitely be formidable in the future. In short, his physical defense would be extremely high. But against "magical damage," that might not be the case. The brocade pouch perfectly made up for this shortcoming, at least ensuring he wouldn't need to worry about being ambushed by strange and messy techniques.

One investment, two returns.
