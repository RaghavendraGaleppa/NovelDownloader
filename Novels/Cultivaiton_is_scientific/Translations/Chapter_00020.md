# Chapter 20: Transforming Rain  

Li Shiming snapped out of the mystical scene conjured by his "Spring Breeze Transforms Rain" spell and turned his gaze toward the area he had watered.  

There stood a patch of camellias, only some of which had been affected by the spell. He walked over to one of the watered plants and examined it closely. The leaves of this camellia bore a vibrant emerald hue, starkly different from the deep green typical of autumn.  

It was currently autumn, and all the camellia leaves should have been dark green. He plucked one and placed it in his mouth. These camellias had been transplanted here by his father, Li Wenyuan, and were regularly harvested for household use. Though Li Shiming had no particular fondness for tea, his predecessor had inherited Li Wenyuan’s refined palate.  

The moment the leaf touched his tongue, he noticed the difference. Its quality had clearly improved, surpassing its previous flavor. He couldn’t help but marvel at the effects of "Spring Breeze Transforms Rain." A single casting had altered the quality of the affected camellias.  

Though he didn’t know how long the enhanced quality would last, even if harvested and processed now, these leaves would surpass most renowned teas. It was a power that transformed the ordinary into the extraordinary, making him wonder what crops immortals could cultivate with spirit fields and this spell.  

Of course, if he truly wanted a taste, he had two bags of spirit rice seeds in his storage pouch. But those were precious seeds—even without consulting *The Basics of Spirit Farming* or Shi Ximing’s cultivation notes, he knew better than to waste them on mere indulgence.  

After sensing the remaining third of the spiritual energy in his dantian, he decided against casting another spell. The leftover energy might still be useful in an emergency.  

"Spells are so difficult to learn and use. This little bit of spiritual energy isn’t nearly enough!" he muttered, shaking his head in frustration.  

What he didn’t know was that not all cultivators in the immortal realm could learn spells. Take "Spring Breeze Transforms Rain," for example. Generally, a cultivator capable of casting it had already stepped into the threshold of becoming a spirit farmer.  

Spirit farming was one of the Hundred Arts of Immortal Cultivation, and entry into this profession was far from easy. If it were simple, it wouldn’t be considered a specialized art. If everyone could perform spirit farming techniques, the value of spirit-grown crops wouldn’t sustain the profession’s exclusivity.  

To become a spirit farmer, one first needed the right spiritual roots—at least water or wood affinity. Additionally, casting "Spring Breeze Transforms Rain" was a hurdle. Though Li Shiming had succeeded on his second attempt, in the immortal realm, this step barred countless cultivators, keeping the number of spirit farmers scarce.  

"Spring Breeze Transforms Rain" was indeed a low-level spell, but its difficulty was anything but low. Perfectly drawing the complex runes was one challenge, while grasping the "intent" of the spell was another.  

Normally, those who pursued spirit farming were cultivators of average talent. True prodigies, nurtured by sects from an early stage, never needed to consider secondary professions.  

For ordinary cultivators, successfully casting "Spring Breeze Transforms Rain" often required years of effort—three to five years, a decade, or sometimes never at all. Most gave up after months of practice, realizing they lacked the aptitude.  

This wasn’t unique to "Spring Breeze Transforms Rain." All spells required alignment with their "intent." Those who couldn’t grasp it had to rely on talismans, which was why cultivators carried so many. Talismans consumed less spiritual energy and were faster to activate, but their prevalence also stemmed from the sheer difficulty of mastering spells.  

Of course, within sects, guidance from experienced masters could help disciples grasp the intent of spells more quickly through accumulated wisdom.

Li Shiming transformed into a tea picker, harvesting all the camellias within the twenty-square-meter area. Back in his machine room space, he processed the leaves into finished tea.  

The controlled environment preserved the enhanced quality from "Spring Breeze Transforms Rain," locking it into the tea. The roasting techniques came from the IBM z15’s vast database, refined over centuries into the most advanced methods.  

Returning to his courtyard, he brewed a cup with the freshly processed tea. A single sip confirmed his earlier judgment—the tea was of exceptional quality, carrying a faint trace of spiritual energy.  

For someone at the second layer of Qi Refinement like him, this trace of energy had no noticeable effect on his body or cultivation. But for ordinary people, tea infused with even this minuscule amount of spiritual energy could offer significant health benefits.  

He filled three jars with the tea. The yield from twenty square meters of camellias wasn’t high, and three jars were already an impressive output after processing.  

"Drinking this myself would be a waste," Li Shiming murmured, downing the last of his cup.  

Packing the three jars into a box, he headed toward the government office district.  

"Congratulations, Xuesi!" greeted Professor Zhou of Nanling Prefecture, using Li Shiming’s courtesy name.  

Baffled, Li Shiming returned the greeting without understanding the reason for the congratulations. Professor Zhou, a seventh-rank official overseeing education in Nanling, offered no further explanation.  

When he reached Li Wenyuan’s office, he found his father in an unusually cheerful mood.  

"Shiming, I was just about to call for you," Li Wenyuan said, beckoning him to sit.  

"Father, what’s the good news?" Li Shiming asked as he took a seat.  

"Tomorrow is the official announcement of the provincial exam results, but the rankings arrived today," Li Wenyuan replied with a smile.  

Most candidates, even those from influential families, couldn’t learn the results early. The finalized rankings were delivered to the prefectural office the day before the announcement, accessible only to the chief examiner, deputy examiners, professors, and the prefect. The public wouldn’t know until the next morning.  

"So I’ve passed the provincial exam!" Li Shiming said, understanding his father’s joy.  

Truthfully, if not for the lingering influence of his predecessor’s obsession with passing the exams, he wouldn’t have felt much excitement. After encountering the world of immortal cultivation, worldly affairs held little sway over him.  

Initially, he had even considered using the knowledge stored in the IBM z15 to change this world and achieve great things. But the revelation of immortals in this world had shifted his aspirations entirely toward cultivation.  

"The chief examiner, to avoid any appearance of favoritism, didn’t name you the top scorer. You ranked second—my position may have influenced the outcome," Li Wenyuan said, pleased yet slightly regretful.
