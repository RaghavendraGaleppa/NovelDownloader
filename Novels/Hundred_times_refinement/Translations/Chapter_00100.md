# Chapter 50: Gathering Storm

Thus, in the following days, Lin Xuan focused all his efforts on purifying several hundred low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills and twenty mid-grade ones.  

The purification of the low-grade pills proceeded smoothly, while the mid-grade ones took more time. The use of the blue light spots had reached a bottleneck—to make any further breakthroughs, his cultivation level would need to advance further, as the energy of the Star Sea was directly proportional to his spiritual power.  

The reason he purified so many pills at once was that Lin Xuan planned to go into seclusion for a period of time. This time, no matter what, he was determined to break through to the late-stage Lingdong level and reach the fifth layer of his cultivation technique.  

With his goal set, Lin Xuan began working diligently toward it. Now, all preparations were complete.  

However, during the time Lin Xuan spent purifying pills, the cultivation world of Yanzhou in the Zhao Kingdom began to feel the tremors of an impending storm. Tensions rose, conflicts between cultivation families became frequent, and though the major sects had yet to take direct action—maintaining a veneer of restraint—verbal skirmishes had already erupted. Loose cultivators grew uneasy, fearing they might be caught in the crossfire.  

The spark that ignited this unrest was the dissolution of the Lingyun Sect. Originally, the sect had offended a Core Formation expert and was forced to disband. While other sects remained outwardly silent, inwardly they rejoiced—after all, this presented numerous benefits. First, they could carve up the Lingyun Sect’s territory.  

Second, many treasures had been acquired from the trading conference. Though the Lingyun Sect was small, its thousand-year accumulation of wealth was enough to make others envious.  

What should have been a joyous occasion, however, took a dark turn after the trading conference. A series of unexpected events unfolded. First, the renowned cultivation family, the Wang Clan, had their dispatched disciples ambushed and killed, with the techniques and treasures they had acquired stolen.  

Yan Tianheng had prided himself on being a cunning fox, but his carelessness left behind traces of evidence. The Wang Clan was furious—as one of the most prominent cultivation families within thousands of miles, they had never suffered such humiliation. Three of their Foundation Establishment elders personally confronted the Yan Clan, demanding Yan Tianheng’s life in retribution.  

At this point, the outcome seemed inevitable. The Wang Clan was strong, the Yan Clan weak. Moreover, Yan Tianheng’s act of murder and theft had crossed a line. While the cultivation world operated on the principle of strength, some decorum was still maintained between families. Yan Tianheng’s actions left no room for negotiation.  

The Wang Clan elders had come to demand Yan Tianheng’s life, only to discover that the Yan Clan’s patriarch and his son had mysteriously vanished, leaving behind only the elderly, women, children, and low-level cultivators.  

Lin Xuan had truly left no loose ends—no one knew that the Yan father and son now lay buried in an unnamed forest. The Wang Clan elders assumed they had fled to avoid punishment.  

Furious, one hot-tempered elder wanted to slaughter the entire Yan Clan on the spot, but the other two restrained him. Not out of kindness or reluctance, but because they didn’t want to escalate the situation before the truth was clear.  

Though the Yan Clan was only a mid-tier cultivation family, they had deep connections with the Fire Spirit Sect. In fact, the Wang Clan themselves were closely tied to the Drifting Cloud Valley.  

In the cultivation world, sects were the dominant powers. Unless a family had an exceptionally powerful expert, they would inevitably align themselves with a sect.  

The method of alignment varied—some chose sects in their vicinity for convenience, others had ancestors who were once disciples of the sect, while some formed alliances through marriages.  

Since Yan Tianheng was clearly in the wrong—having killed and stolen without mercy—the Fire Spirit Sect would have had no grounds to defend him. If they had acted unreasonably, the Drifting Cloud Valley, backing the Wang Clan, would have intervened. But now that Yan Tianheng and his son had disappeared, exterminating the entire Yan Clan in retaliation would provoke the Fire Spirit Sect. In that case, the Wang Clan would be the ones at fault.  

Though the cultivation world ultimately respected strength, this applied only when there was a vast disparity in power. If two sides were evenly matched and neither wished for mutual destruction, then "reason" had to be observed.  

Thus, the Wang Clan elders left with harsh words but did not act immediately. Instead, they split up—one returned to report and mobilize disciples to search for Yan Tianheng, while the other two lay in wait near the Yan Clan, keeping watch.  

Upon hearing that their patriarch had brought disaster upon them, the Yan Clan was stunned and terrified. At first, they believed there must have been a misunderstanding and waited for Yan Tianheng to return and clarify. But as time passed with no sign of him or his son, their confusion turned to suspicion. They began to believe that the Wang Clan elders had secretly killed their patriarch and were now framing him to cover their tracks.  

Naturally, the Yan Clan refused to accept this and sought help from the Fire Spirit Sect.  

The Fire Spirit Sect, as its name suggested, specialized in fire-attribute techniques. In terms of strength, they ranked second among Yanzhou’s sects, just slightly behind the Drifting Cloud Valley.  

Their sect leader was at the Foundation Establishment stage, but they also had a Core Formation elder. This elder, though powerful, was notorious for his lustful nature—and Yan Tianheng’s second daughter happened to be one of his favored concubines.  

With this connection, coupled with the long-standing rivalry between the Fire Spirit Sect and the Drifting Cloud Valley for dominance in Yanzhou, tensions that had been simmering beneath the surface now boiled over.  

The Yan Clan and the Wang Clan each presented their version of events—one side claiming their disciples had been murdered and their treasures stolen, the other insisting their patriarch had been killed and the accusations were false. The feud between these two families now dragged the Drifting Cloud Valley and the Fire Spirit Sect into the conflict.  

As these two giants clashed, the other sects in Yanzhou could not remain neutral. Some sided with the Fire Spirit Sect, others with the Drifting Cloud Valley, forming two opposing alliances.  

Though the quarrels remained largely verbal for now, the leaders of the major sects were no fools—they knew that outright conflict would only lead to mutual destruction. Yet the scent of gunpowder hung thick in the air. Loose cultivators grew increasingly wary, fearing they might be swept into the storm.  

Other cultivation families naturally took sides based on their allegiances, adding to the chaos. Unlike the sects, they had fewer reservations—old grudges resurfaced, and in recent days, clashes between families had already begun.  

In short, the situation was spiraling out of control.
