Chapter 105: The Wuzhou Affair

"Is this how the Hidden Blade Pavilion taught you?"

The twilight, like ink, soaked the horizon. Fu Jin's voice, carrying the coldness of clashing iron, exploded in Yue Shan's ear.

"Master Fu Jin?!"

The hairs on the back of Yue Shan's neck stood on end, and the veins beneath his skin throbbed. As he turned, he lost his footing, and the green bricks beneath his feet cracked like a spider's web. His hoarse, startled cry pierced the dusk, its final note trembling with a fear he hadn't even realized he felt.

Fu Jin gave a slight tug with his hand, and Yue Shan's mountain-like body was sent tumbling across the ground like a wooden stake. He crashed heavily against the wall, smashing a large hole through it and rolling out into the courtyard.

Yue Shan, covered in dust and dirt, scrambled to his feet. Just as he was about to leave with his head down, Xu Yunfan called out to him.

"Wait."

Before Yue Shan could react, his vision blurred, and Xu Yunfan was already standing directly in front of him.

Startled and furious, he said in a low voice, "What more do you want?"

Xu Yunfan replied, "You've made a mess of the courtyard. The fine iron posts I had such a hard time installing were all torn down by you, and you've smashed a hole in the wall. You think you can just leave without paying for the damages?"

Yue Shan's face turned a mottled purple and green. He wanted to explode, but seeing Fu Jin standing to the side with his arms crossed and a dark expression, he held back.

He pulled a hundred-tael silver note from his pocket, crumpled it into a ball, threw it at Xu Yunfan, and hurried away with his head down.

Watching Yue Shan's retreating figure, Xu Yunfan clicked his tongue. "This is only the second time I've seen someone this big."

Fu Jin said, "The Hidden Blade Pavilion has a technique called the Dark Tortoise Carries the Mountain Skill. This kid has a natural gift and was raised in medicinal baths since he was young. It's not strange for him to grow this big. You'll have chances to see even taller ones in the future."

He reached out and patted Xu Yunfan's shoulder, looking at the bewildered Xu Yunfan with a complex expression.

"The journey here must have been difficult, wasn't it?"

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. Seeing Fu Jin covered in dust, he realized that Fu Jin had been investigating his background. He said nonchalantly, "Where do you get that idea, Senior Brother? Every难关 is there to be overcome. As the saying goes, 'A time will come to ride the wind and cleave the waves; I'll hoist my sail to cross the vast sea.' Haven't I risen now?"

"'A time will come to ride the wind and cleave the waves.'" The more Fu Jin savored the line, the more brilliant he found it. He couldn't help but slap his thigh. "That's a great poem! It suits your name perfectly."

"Hardly, hardly. I've kept this name from the beginning to the end, and I've been using it to this day."

"Ambition is a good thing. From now on, the Heavenly Work Cave is your home. There's no need to be restrained. If you need anything, just let your Senior Brother know."

"By the way, Senior Brother."

"What is it?"

"What's your current cultivation level?"

"Half a step away from Blood Transformation. I'm at that age now. If I don't break through within the next two years and my blood and Qi begin to decline, then there won't be much hope left."

"I have another question."

"Hm?"

"When I entered the Mechanism City back then, with your status, you shouldn't have had to go and receive people, right?"

"Of course not. It was my shift that day, and I had nothing else to do, so I came to see what kind of fool would pay fifty taels for the toll. That sliding platform was developed by the Mechanism Hall and is rarely used, almost rusting away. I didn't expect you, Junior Brother, to make such a unique entrance. You truly can do what others cannot. I am inferior."

"..."

Fu Jin told him not to pay any mind to Yue Shan, saying the man was simple-minded and had been used as a pawn to test him. If he encountered him again in the future, he could just fight back. As long as no one died, everything would be fine.

Xu Yunfan agreed readily.

The artisans from the Heavenly Work Department had the courtyard restored to its original state in less than half an hour.

"That will be forty-nine taels and eight mace," said a disciple of the Heavenly Work Department, his abacus made of dark iron clicking rapidly. "We'll consider the change a congratulatory gift for Senior Brother Xu's promotion. Just give us a full fifty taels."

"So expensive?!" Xu Yunfan blurted out in shock.

The disciple from the Heavenly Work Department chuckled. "Senior Brother, don't think it's expensive. Asking our Heavenly Work Department for such a small job is really using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. We build mechanism towers and cities, and construct impregnable fortresses. If you weren't a candidate for a true disciple, our department wouldn't have even come."

*Ah, so they're the civil engineering brothers!*

What could Xu Yunfan do? He grimaced as he pulled out the silver to pay, forcing a smile to thank them.

After seeing the Heavenly Work Department out and turning to go back, Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. Outside the vermilion courtyard gate stood a girl holding a sword, not even as tall as his chest. She had two buns in her hair, and stubborn tufts of hair on her head that refused to lie flat. It was the same girl from the neighboring courtyard in Cuibo City who had complained about him being a public nuisance.

"So you're the designated true disciple of the Forging Hall."

The girl was both surprised and displeased. She clicked her tongue twice, then turned and left without another word, leaving Xu Yunfan completely baffled.

Watching the girl's retreating back, Fu Jin, who had supposedly already left, reappeared beside Xu Yunfan like a ghost.

"Taken a liking to her?"

Fu Jin stroked his chin, pondering the girl's departing figure. "That's the granddaughter of the current Heavenly Work Cave Master, Hong Siyang. Let's see, she's twelve years old already. She'll be marriageable in two years. It might be a good idea to have the Master bring it up with the Cave Master. If we could arrange a match, it would be a good thing..."

"Senior Brother! She's still a child!"

Xu Yunfan almost jumped up, shaking his head repeatedly. "I appreciate the thought, Senior Brother, but I must focus on my martial arts training now. Matters of the heart can wait until my great martial arts are complete."

"That's true. For now, prioritizing martial arts is key. Put aside matters of love for now. Alright, I won't disturb you. Hurry up and practice."

Fu Jin waved his hand and was about to leave when Xu Yunfan called him back.

"Senior Brother, I want to learn forging from you."

Fu Jin was taken aback, then frowned. "Your most urgent task now is to practice martial arts. Blacksmithing and forging can wait."

Xu Yunfan said, "Senior Brother, my Whirlwind Hammer is already at perfection, and I can wield the heavy hammer as I wish. If I can learn forging and master the changes in the weight of the force, my control will surely reach a new level. It will be of great benefit to the growth of my strength."

Fu Jin thought for a moment upon hearing this. "I need to discuss this with the Master first. You just focus on practicing your martial arts for now."

After Fu Jin hurried back, the following days passed without much incident. Xu Yunfan's identity was now confirmed. Although he had appeared out of thin air from Beiye City, he had come from the direction of the Eight Hundred Miles of Barren Ice Plains. With the Heavenly Work Cave's network, they could naturally inquire about the affairs of Ninggu Tower.

As a result, every time Fu Jin came over, he would let out a long sigh upon seeing Xu Yunfan, saying he was a pitiful child, on par with the Divine Weapon Ridge, and it annoyed Xu Yunfan to no end with this shared sense of misfortune.

It wasn't until yesterday, when news arrived that Wuzhou had been sealed off by the Great Zhou Imperial Court, that things quieted down. Zhan Yan was still in seclusion forging a weapon for him. As the acting manager, Fu Jin was pulled into a meeting, and Xu Yunfan finally got some peace.

One hundred thousand Xuanjia Huben troops were campaigning in Wuzhou, destroying mountains and demolishing temples. All fourteen sects had their gates trampled into dust.

This news was a thunderclap to the martial world. It was said that even the Nine Luminaries Sect, the only top-tier sect in Yanbei Dao, had personally sent people to the Imperial Capital.
