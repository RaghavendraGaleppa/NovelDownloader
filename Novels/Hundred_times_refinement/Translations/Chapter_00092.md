# Chapter 42: Invisibility Talisman  

The richly dressed young man's eyes widened in astonishment as he stared at Lin Xuan. No wonder—in the eyes of aristocratic disciples like him, rogue cultivators were usually poor. Yet this unassuming fellow had casually produced 160 Marrow Cleansing Pills, making him reevaluate his assumptions.  

Could this guy actually be from another prominent family or even a sect?  

The thought crossed Yan Ming's mind, and he scrutinized Lin Xuan from head to toe. No, disciples from sects wore distinctive attire, and even those from noble families wouldn’t dress so shabbily. This guy was the very picture of a rogue cultivator.  

Perhaps he was just a lucky fool who had stumbled upon a small fortune.  

With that thought, Yan Ming’s expression turned haughty again. "This young master bids 170 Marrow Cleansing Pills."  

"180!"  

"190."  

"200!" Lin Xuan gritted his teeth. He was determined to obtain the Spirit Control Technique. After preparing for so long, how could he leave empty-handed?  

---  

Cold sweat beaded on Yan Ming’s forehead. He never imagined this unremarkable-looking kid would have so many pills. Although the Yan family was a mid-tier cultivation clan with centuries of heritage, their wealth wasn’t limitless. Two hundred Marrow Cleansing Pills would strain their resources, possibly even forcing them to sell off treasures.  

But before leaving, his father had given strict orders: no matter the cost, they had to acquire a mid-tier cultivation manual. The reason was simple—his father, the clan leader, was on the verge of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage but lacked a suitable technique.  

The escalating bids drew the attention of nearby cultivators, and murmurs spread through the crowd.  

"Heavens, 200 Marrow Cleansing Pills!"  

"Where did this rogue cultivator come from? How is he so rich? Daring to challenge a cultivation family?"  

"Rich? More like reckless. Just wait—even if he gets that manual, he’ll bring disaster upon himself."  

"Hmph, not necessarily. If he’s unafraid of the Yan family, he might have a powerful master backing him."  

---  

The last remark echoed Yan Ming’s own thoughts. A rogue cultivator behaving like this was too strange. As the crowd grew larger, a shadow of unease flickered across Lin Xuan’s face. The situation was getting worse—he had to act quickly.  

Time to cut the Gordian knot.  

He pulled out a jade vial from his robes and placed it solemnly on the stall. "This, plus 200 low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills. Do we have a deal?"  

What was this?  

Every cultivator present was struck with curiosity. The stall owner, a disciple of the Lingyun Sect, snapped out of his daze—he never expected a mid-tier technique to fetch such a price.  

From Lin Xuan’s grave expression, it was clear this was no ordinary item.  

The stall owner swallowed hard and opened the vial. Instantly, a refreshing fragrance wafted out. Inside lay a small, pale-blue pill.  

A mid-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill!  

Though most had never seen one before, they recognized it from descriptions in texts—the color and scent matched perfectly.  

Gasps erupted from the crowd.  

Even the arrogant Yan Ming stood dumbfounded, mouth agape.  

No one could have imagined a rogue cultivator possessing a mid-grade pill.  

In the cultivation world, pill refinement was an extremely delicate art. Even low-grade pills had a success rate of only 50-60%, while mid-grade pills were rarer than one in five—and required highly skilled alchemists. Not even a sect like the Piaoyun Valley could refine mid-grade pills. Only a handful of ancient, prestigious sects with tens of thousands of years of heritage had small stocks of them, reserved for elite disciples during breakthroughs.  

Theoretically, one mid-grade pill could be exchanged for ten low-grade ones, but in reality, no one would make such a foolish trade. The potency of a mid-grade pill far surpassed that of its low-grade counterpart, especially during critical breakthroughs.  

Greed flickered in the eyes of the onlookers, and their gazes toward Lin Xuan grew increasingly suspicious. How could a rogue cultivator possibly possess a mid-grade pill? Was Lin Xuan hiding his true strength?  

"Well? Do we have a deal?"  

"Sold!"  

The Lingyun Sect disciple clutched the mid-grade pill tightly, as if afraid Lin Xuan might change his mind. Yan Ming hesitated, his lips moving soundlessly before he ultimately stayed silent. His family could barely afford 200 low-grade pills—a mid-grade pill was beyond their wildest dreams. Moreover, he no longer dared to treat Lin Xuan as an ordinary rogue cultivator.  

Once the deal was done, Lin Xuan tucked the jade slip into his robes without delay. He pushed through the crowd and swiftly left the plaza.  

---  

Lin Xuan didn’t even return to his pavilion—all his belongings were stored in his spatial ring. He headed straight for the teleportation array to exit the Lingyun Sect, then used the Wind Riding Technique to descend Tianzhu Peak.  

Along the way, he cautiously spread his spiritual sense and confirmed that several groups were tailing him. He wasn’t surprised or anxious—this was expected. Given the commotion he’d caused during the auction, it would be strange if no one coveted his treasures.  

Planning to kill and rob him?  

A mocking smile curled Lin Xuan’s lips. He led his pursuers in circles before arriving at a small valley not far from Tianzhu Peak. The area was strewn with jagged rocks and winding paths, forming a natural labyrinth.  

Coming to a stop, Lin Xuan retrieved a red talisman from his spatial bracelet. His eyes flashed with reluctance, but after a brief hesitation, he affixed it to his body and sat cross-legged, chanting an incantation.  

Under the infusion of spiritual energy, the talisman glowed brilliantly, transforming into a white mist that enveloped him. Moments later, the mist dissipated—and Lin Xuan vanished.  

This was an Invisibility Talisman, a rare high-tier artifact capable of concealing both form and spiritual fluctuations. Even Foundation Establishment experts wouldn’t detect him. The drawback? He couldn’t move for three hours, or the effect would break.  

And so, Lin Xuan disappeared without a trace.
