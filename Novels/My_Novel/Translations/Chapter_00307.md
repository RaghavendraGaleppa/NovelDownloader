# Chapter 307: The Temple Fair

East of Feilong City stood a mountain over a thousand feet high, named the Prayer圣 Mountain. Upon it stood the "Feilong Temple," which was said to be extremely effective in its灵验. People prayed there for good weather, wealth, sons, and to ward off evil spirits... Every temple fair was packed with people from all directions, creating a grand spectacle of pushing and shoving.

Li Xian feared that the five members of the "Five Elements Flower Formation" might leak the "Flower Cage Gate" identity, causing围攻 and unnecessary trouble. Therefore, he ordered the five to stay at the inn and not go out. He, however, got up early, drank a bowl of plain porridge, blackened his face with胭脂, messed up his hair, and mixed in with the common people to arrive at the foot of Feilong Temple.

Looking up at the mountain top.

Feilong Temple stood high above, its buildings towering, with ten thousand people paying respects. The slanting sun shone from the east, casting a golden glow that was dazzlingly bright.

At the foot of the mountain were several "Incense Pavilion Buildings" selling "incense," "offerings," "tribute tea," and other items.凡百姓路经此处，都需先进香火阁楼购置上庙的香火物事.

Li Xian heard that the "Woman surnamed Wang" was going to the temple. He wanted to get close to observe her, thinking: "I can use the crowd to hide myself and secretly use my Heavy Pupil to窥探. If she practices a vicious martial art, like Hao Qingshe's poison techniques, there should be some sign. Even if I can't see through her, it's always beneficial to make early contact and get to know her better."

He looked at the high temple and muttered to himself: "This temple is really strange. Setting it so high is such a hassle. Since it's a temple,秉承民生之愿景, it should be integrated with the people and convenient for them. Oh well, if you're going to put on a show, do it properly. Since I'm here, I can't go back empty-handed."

The Incense Pavilion Building was noisy and crowded, with all kinds of incense displayed.

Li Xian looked around and was shocked to find the incense extremely expensive. A three-inch stick cost "three文钱." To offer incense to all the gods and Buddhas in the temple, one had to be fair to each, offering three sticks to each statue, totaling thirty-six sticks, which cost "one hundred and eight文钱."

Li Xian was very surprised. He knew well how precious "one hundred and eight文钱" was; it could buy meat and fill one's stomach for several meals, or buy coarse linen clothes to keep warm through the winter.

The owner of the Incense Pavilion Building had a big belly and two black whiskers curled by his mouth. He smiled like a catfish, looking oily and rich, his lips gleaming with oil. He had a faint smell of rotten meat on him.

The three-inch incense was the most common. There were also "Nine Palace Incense," "Ask Buddha Incense," "Filial Piety Incense"... with lengths like six-point-four inches, nine-point-nine inches... varying in thickness, and the prices rose accordingly.

There were also "paper ingots," "candles," and many other offering items, all with different grades. Li Xian roughly understood that for ordinary people to enter the temple to worship the Buddhas and pray for safety, they needed to buy "incense," "candles," "ingots," and various other items, totaling over two hundred文钱.

Although Feilong City was wealthy, with streets full of magnificent buildings and golden tiles, it was not easy for ordinary people to make a living. Being able to save over a hundred文钱 a month was considered quite well-off.

Li Xian looked through the first floor and saw a staircase leading upwards. He was curious: "The incense on the first floor is so expensive; what would it be like on the second floor? Since I'm here, I might as well broaden my horizons." He wanted to go up to the second floor of the Incense Pavilion Building. The owner was lying on a chair, drowsy. Suddenly seeing Li Xian about to go upstairs, his thin eyebrows immediately furrowed. He looked Li Xian up and down, saw his simple clothes, obviously an ordinary city-dweller, and immediately blocked his way, saying: "Hey, hey, hey, where did this commoner come from? Don't you have any sense? Is that a place for you to go?"

Most of the worshippers were ordinary people. Half of them were couples, and their clothes were not luxurious. Li Xian blended in with them without any flaws, making him completely inconspicuous. There were also many wandering martial artists and wealthy young masters, some dressed in luxurious clothes that made people dare not look down on them, others dressed plainly but with an unmistakable martial aura.

If these people wanted to go to the second floor, the owner would not dare to stop them. Li Xian thought to himself: "If that's the case, then forget it. Why should I bother with these people?" He turned around and bought a bundle of incense, candles, and ingots... spending two hundred文钱 before leaving. He didn't dwell on such trivial matters.

Not long after he left, three more guests arrived at the Incense Pavilion Building: two men and a woman, Gu Nianjun, Li Xiaofan, and Zhou Shijie.

Today, Feilong Temple was holding a temple fair. Gu Nianjun and Zhou Shijie heard about it and wanted to join the fun. They got up early and came to visit. Li Xiaofan happened to have some free time and accompanied them. Arriving at the foot of Prayer圣 Mountain, they saw the dense crowds and the lively atmosphere, and felt they had made the right choice. They decided to go up the mountain to the temple.

Gu Nianjun came from a good background and knew the rules of temple fairs. She skillfully walked into the Incense Pavilion Building to buy the necessary items. She glanced at the incense on the first floor and went straight to the second floor.

The owner's eyes lit up when he saw Gu Nianjun in her purple dress, her appearance not ordinary. Beside her was another young master, tall and handsome, with a noble bearing, also not an ordinary person. Another fair-faced youth, with an extraordinary demeanor, calm and composed, also stood out from the crowd.

He dared not stop them. He immediately went up to them with a smile, saying all kinds of auspicious and flattering words, fawning over them as he led them upstairs with a bow.

The incense on the second floor was all placed in special boxes.

The owner opened a box, and a faint fragrance drifted out. He introduced: "Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jade River Incense. The incense stick is like jade, and when burned, its fragrance curls above, bringing blessings to the people. The stick is five feet and seven inches long and can burn for three full days and nights!"

Zhou Shijie nodded slightly, gently waving his folding fan, and said: "Nianjun, since we're难得来此一趟, why not use this incense?"

Gu Nianjun said: "No rush, there are many types of incense here, let's look around some more." She walked forward. The owner immediately followed, introducing several types of incense one after another.

There was "Dragon Spittle Nine-Foot Incense," "Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense," "Seven-Colored Glazed Incense," "Purple Qi Eastward Incense"...

These exotic incenses had unique appearances, and burning them could produce strange phenomena in the sky, like divine signs descending to the world, inspiring endless imagination. They were therefore very popular. Only those from wealthy families with considerable money dared to touch these exotic incenses.

Gu Nianjun asked: "Xiaofan, these incenses have quite a lot of meaning. Which one do you think is better?"

Li Xiaofan said: "I originally thought the Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense had a good name and meaning. But the stick is nine feet and nine inches long, carved with golden dragons and phoenixes, extremely luxurious, and it costs nine hundred and ninety-nine taels. This seems to contradict its meaning. It's like finding an excuse to show off wealth. Whether the world is peaceful or not is unknown, but the one burning the incense enjoys great wealth and spends money like water. It's not as sincere as the ordinary three-inch common incense..."

Zhou Shijie suddenly interrupted: "I don't think so. In these chaotic times, there is a trend of impending chaos. Why is it chaotic? Because the dynasty is weak, and no one can suppress the feudal lords. In other words, to have ten thousand generations of peace, one must achieve the extreme, with great courage, great fearlessness, and great momentum. Therefore, in the Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense, gold dragons and phoenixes are inlaid, symbolizing the two sages in the sky, meant to intimidate the insignificant. The stick is nine feet and nine inches long,寓意太平长久, endless."

The owner said with a smile: "This young master has great vision! Exactly, that's the meaning."

Li Xiaofan smiled and said: "Brother Zhou makes a good point." Then he said no more. Zhou Shijie felt very proud and said with a smile: "Little brother Xiaofan, you are still young and your knowledge is still shallow. You need to learn more."

Gu Nianjun said: "We came from afar and don't want to show off. The idea of ten thousand generations of peace can be kept in our hearts. This incense is indeed a bit ostentatious. Xiaofan, which incense do you like?"

Li Xiaofan said with a bitter smile: "Sister Gu, you're really putting me in a difficult position. I've been poor since I was a child, eating porridge and drinking water, counting every文钱. Now you're asking me to choose an exotic incense, costing hundreds or thousands of taels... I've never seen so much money since I was born. If I really had that much money, I'd rather give it away to people to buy clothes and food. Burning it like this to worship some vague thing... it really hurts my heart."

Saying this, he was afraid of ruining Gu Nianjun's mood, and added: "So, I'll leave it to you, Sister Gu, to decide."

Gu Nianjun felt a bit guilty and said with a smile: "Xiaofan, having this heart is very good. In that case, let's buy the three-inch common incense. We'll experience what it's like for ordinary people to offer incense."

"Ouch!" The owner said: "Three guests, that's not right, not right. What this young brother said seems reasonable, but it's actually not."

Li Xiaofan blinked and asked: "Please, tell us." He was very humble, thinking his knowledge was shallow. The purpose of traveling to study was to learn from different people. Good people,恶人,奸 people, and bad people all have their own logic. Even if it's fallacious, one needs to listen, reflect, and debate.

The owner said: "This young guest said that the money used to buy incense is just burned away. That's very wrong. That money clearly goes into my account."

Li Xiaofan, Gu Nianjun, and Zhou Shijie looked at each other and smiled. The owner continued: "My Incense Pavilion Building sells incense, candles, ingots, tribute tea... it requires a lot of manpower. This money first goes into my account, and I pay the staff every month. They use the money for food, clothing, and daily expenses, which then circulates to the accounts of tens of thousands of people."

"In this way... how can this money be considered burned away? It clearly benefits the people, a great act of kindness! Besides... when the Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense is burned, Feilong Temple will emit a strange phenomenon, illuminating the people, and the people will rejoice, their will凝聚. Isn't that making the best use of it?"

Gu Nianjun said with a smile: "I didn't expect you to have such insight." Li Xiaofan nodded and said: "I've been taught."

Zhou Shijie said with a smile: "Xiaofan is young and needs more experience." Li Xiaofan didn't argue and fell into deep thought. The owner's fallacies were easy to refute, but he had suddenly been inspired and thought of something deeper.

Gu Nianjun said with a smile: "This incense is still too ostentatious. Let's just buy the three-inch common incense." She completely ignored his sales pitch.

The owner quickly called out to stop them: "Three guests, wait..." Zhou Shijie felt a bit indignant, thinking Gu Nianjun treated Li Xiaofan too well.

Gu Nianjun said: "Is there anything else?" The owner said: "I see that you three are young and spirited, outstanding among men, not ordinary people. Your background, martial arts, knowledge, demeanor, and experience must be extraordinary. The temple fair is grand, and to be honest, several young heroes have already come here this morning to buy exotic incense. When the fair starts, they will surely shine brilliantly. If you three are truly indifferent to fame and fortune, that's fine too."

The implication was that the temple fair was a place for young talents to compete and show off their wealth and strength. Zhou Shijie was already indignant, and hearing these words to provoke him, he deliberately argued against it, while also wanting to show his distinction. He advised: "Nianjun, this is quite meaningful. It's a good opportunity to make friends with peers. If you are stingy with this bit of money, it would be... a great pity!"

Gu Nianjun's eyes turned slightly. She was indeed tempted. She was also young, and seeing the temple fair so lively, such a grand scene was rare to witness. Moreover, many peers and talents would be showing their faces. How could she be willing to be left out?

Gu Nianjun said softly: "Alright... Xiaofan, I'll buy an exotic incense for you too. Since you're traveling to study, you should make friends with good peers and talents. You should be frugal when you can, but use it when you need to. This opportunity is rare; you need to see the world."

Li Xiaofan, although pained by the cost, thought Gu Nianjun and Zhou Shijie were not wrong. He obediently said: "Okay."

The temple fair was bustling with noise and excitement. Li Xian finished buying his incense, ingots, and red candles, wrapped them in coarse cloth, and walked up the mountain along the stone steps. The path was crowded with people, some talking about household affairs, others gossiping about the neighbors, very noisy and lively, showing all aspects of common life.

The mountain path was winding, paved with bluestone slabs, and the snow on the road had been cleared. Because there were many people around and the human energy was dense, it didn't feel cold. Going a bit further, small vendors appeared on both sides, selling rice balls, water, pickles, and other food.

Halfway up the mountain, a flat area suddenly appeared, called the "Altar to the Sage," meaning that from here upwards, it was the territory of Feilong Temple.

A furnace was set up in the middle, with flames raging inside. The people lined up in an orderly manner and threw paper ingots into the fire. The fire burned for a long time, searingly hot. The terrain here was high and originally quite cold, but the heat from the furnace drove all the surrounding chill away.

Li Xian saw it was noon and his stomach was a little hungry, so he bought a hot rice ball from a vendor and ate it under a tree to fill his stomach. The temple fair was just beginning to get crowded and lively. Suddenly, he heard the sound of gongs and drums, and the crowd gathered in one place. Li Xian jumped onto a tree branch and looked towards the sound. He saw someone performing a ritual at the Altar to the Sage.

The man wore a Taoist robe, held a wooden sword, stepped on a celestial pattern, and chanted prayers. It was gibberish, completely unintelligible. The surrounding people formed a circle, watching intently. Li Xian observed from a distance and vaguely saw that this was no mere acrobatics. It was a set of martial arts. His strange muttering, the sudden vigorous waving of the wooden sword, and the forceful stomping of his feet all contained the ability of "ethereal fairy sound." The onlookers were completely unaware and were already influenced by the martial arts.

The crowd moved further up, arriving at the first temple, the "Temple of the Hidden Duke." Inside, a stone statue was worshipped, about ten feet high, with wide, angry eyes, a beard, and holding a pair of linked iron rods. It looked upright and fierce, meant to drive away the insignificant. In front of the statue was an incense burner. Smoke drifted up, curling around the deity.

The crowd rushed forward, fighting to offer incense, showing extreme piety. Only after inserting the incense into the burner did they sigh in relief, kowtow, and recite various prayers. Most hoped for the "Hidden Duke to show his spirit," to punish injustice, and so on. Suddenly, several people trembled all over, their faces filled with terror, and they cried out: "Hidden Duke, spare me, Hidden Duke, spare me..." They confessed all their past crimes, then stiffened and fainted.

The onlookers were even more convinced, quickly kowtowing and praising the Hidden Duke for seeking justice for the people and punishing the wicked. Li Xian frowned slightly and saw the trick.

It turned out...

Whether the Hidden Duke showed his spirit or not was unknown. The key was in that ritual. That ritual was actually a form of martial arts that affected the mind. When offering incense, those with weaker spirits would feel as if they saw the Hidden Duke appearing and angrily interrogating them. Those with weaker characters would confess all their guilty deeds.

Since ancient times, no one is perfect. Who in the world has no guilty conscience?

Li Xian thought to himself: "The people are ignorant. If this continues, they will truly believe there are gods here. No wonder they are so pious. With just this one temple, they can make a fortune and earn a good reputation. It's truly a hundred benefits without a single harm. But it's the people who suffer, wasting a lot of silver to come here. These people have been like this since they were young, and it's hard to wake them up. I won't add to the trouble." He didn't use his lightness skill, but moved through the crowd, took out three sticks of incense, and inserted them into the burner.

His face was pious, but his mind was elsewhere. Behind the Temple of the Hidden Duke was a narrow path through the green forest, which was surprisingly lush and full of life. A stream trickled down from above.

From the Altar to the Sage upwards, there were a total of thirteen temples. Each temple worshipped a deity: "Hidden Duke Temple," "Wealth and Fortune Temple," "Offering Son Temple," "Maiden E Temple"... all filled with incense smoke and bustling with activity.

The "Maiden E Temple" was the fifth one, and only women were allowed to enter. They had to offer a drop of blood from their index finger.

The higher the altitude, the more mystical the temples became. When he reached the seventh temple, the "Snake God Temple," a brown python, about eight feet long and as thick as a millstone, was coiled beside the stone statue. Its head had prominent horns, and it had four small legs on its belly, looking very divine.

Bathed in the incense smoke, it exhaled mist. Its vertical pupils seemed intelligent, and its snake body had a禅意, draped in a袭裟. Li Xian's eyes were opened. He muttered to himself: "If I hadn't practiced martial arts and opened my eyes, I would have been like an ordinary person coming to worship. Seeing these strange sights, I would have inevitably become a devout believer."

He offered the incense as usual, bowed respectfully. Going further up, after passing two more temples, he faced a narrow mountain path. One side was a ten-thousand-foot cliff, and the path was only wide enough for two people to walk. Although it was not difficult to pass, one had to overcome the fear in one's heart.

At the entrance, a monk said: "Everyone, this path has a risk of falling off the cliff. If you are afraid of the high cliffs, please turn left. There is a Three Sages Temple there, where you can also offer incense to the Three Sages. There are also cushions, and you can sit freely. Later, when the time comes, the bronze bell will be rung, and you can also see the incense phenomenon from there. We will all share the great fortune."

Most of the common people turned left. They arrived at the "Three Sages Temple," which occupied a large area with a wide view, able to overlook the pavilions on the mountain top. Feilong Temple had a total of thirteen temples, but only twelve deities were worshipped.

The first nine temples were easy to access, just follow the mountain path, and ordinary people could worship. The tenth was the "Three Sages Temple," which housed the memorial tablets of the deities from the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth temples.

Because the latter three deities were located at higher altitudes, the roads became increasingly rugged. Ordinary people were frail and could easily fall off the cliff. To go further was to risk falling.

Therefore, a "Three Sages Temple" was set up here, housing the tablets of the three deities. People could go to the Three Sages Temple to offer incense and worship, avoiding the risk of falling off the cliff and not needing to go up the rugged mountain path. They could still show their piety by offering incense.

However, the devout could continue up the mountain to face the true images of the Three Sages. The crowd split into two paths: sixty percent went to the Three Sages Temple, and forty percent continued up the mountain.

Li Xian walked along the cliff wall, his gaze sharp, and quickly noticed many protruding niches on the steep cliff wall, housing some nameless minor deities. Because they were on the cliff, there was nowhere to stand, so ordinary people could not offer incense.

However, there were still incense offerings in the niches. Suddenly, he heard the crowd exclaim in surprise. A young man leaped out from the crowd, using his lightness skill, flying and leaping across the cliff. Holding incense, he offered it to a niche, then quickly returned to the crowd.

The common people cheered and applauded. The young man's eyebrows flew high, looking very proud. It turned out that the small niches on the cliff were all set up to highlight the talents. Young talents, to show their distinction and superior lightness skill, saw the remote niches that others could not reach and insisted on offering incense there.

One after another, heroes flew to the cliff to offer incense, showing off their skills. Some had excellent lightness skill, some had agile movements, some had powerful sword techniques... a hundred methods could achieve the goal.

Li Xian observed that there were sixteen nameless niches on the cliff, from low to high, from easy to difficult. The lowest niche had hundreds of sticks of incense, while the highest had only a few.

Many young heroes tried their best. They wanted to place the incense in the high niche, but due to various obstacles, they all failed.

Li Xian watched the heroes show their风采 with great interest. Several figures were quite strong, but he absolutely did not participate. He passed through the steep path and arrived at the very top of Feilong Temple. The terrain here was vast, and three temples stood towering, with an imposing aura.

Li Xian looked around, searching for the trace of the "Woman surnamed Wang." He never saw her. He figured she might not have arrived yet, so he wasn't in a hurry to go down the mountain and waited at the top.

He found a relatively remote but open place to rest. Drinking water, enjoying the cool breeze, and occasionally observing the surroundings. The temple fair grew more and more crowded, presenting an extremely lively scene.

Suddenly, the "bronze bell" rang, its sound echoing through Prayer圣 Mountain. Dozens of laborers carried five bronze furnaces. They were three feet high and four feet wide, extremely imposing. They were put down with a "thud," shaking the ground for several yards around.

The onlookers all gasped and discussed among themselves. The abbot of Feilong Temple said: "The time has come. Those who have exotic incense may come here to offer it." Then he stepped aside.

The crowd was in an uproar, gathered around the bronze tripod, discussing.

Suddenly, someone shouted: "Let me go first. There must be more powerful people here. I have little money and skill, so I'll set an example for everyone." A young man in a light green robe walked out quickly, his eyebrows flying high, full of spirit. He bowed to the crowd.

Then he opened a special box and took out a long incense stick. The crowd gasped in surprise. This incense was called "Eight-Nine Mysterious Ruler Incense." The stick was eight feet and nine inches long, made from special animal fat, weighing a thousand pounds, like a giant club.

The young man held the long incense, his inner energy powerful, and wielded it like an iron ruler, creating a whistling sound. Waves of wind swept the surroundings. He used a certain "sword technique," with a posture of treating the heavy as light, making the crowd exclaim repeatedly.

Outsiders watch the excitement, insiders watch the artistry. There were many martial arts experts here, all nodding secretly, their eyes filled with praise. Gu Nianjun, Zhou Shijie, and Li Xiaofan had also arrived and were watching.

The young man danced for a while and shouted: "I've shown my clumsiness." He leaped up and inserted the "Eight-Nine Mysterious Ruler Incense" into the furnace. The furnace shook violently with a "thud."

The core of the "Eight-Nine Mysterious Ruler Incense" was made of iron. To light it, one had to find a way to make the iron burn. This was very difficult. Iron is extremely hard to burn. If one lacks the ability, even if they buy this incense, they cannot light it to show its power. The young man had just performed the "Iron Heart Sword Technique," with a move called "Heart Like Tempered Iron." This move contained the subtlety of "ethereal fairy sound." Every swing made the iron core undergo a thousand refinements, generating a scorching heat, which then ignited the exotic incense!

只见 the Eight-Nine Mysterious Ruler Incense burned, and the white smoke shot straight up into the sky. It didn't bend at all, regardless of the wind or snow, still piercing the sky, showing its sharp锋芒.

A young man in a purple robe clapped and praised: "Good! Very good! So you are a disciple of the Jiu Mountain Sword Sect! This Iron Heart Sword Technique is extremely exquisite. I've seen it, I've seen it!"

The young man from the Jiu Mountain Sword Sect was named "Wang Dezhong." He laughed heartily: "Hahaha, I've shown my clumsiness, I've shown my clumsiness. Don't laugh at me, brothers. I'm waiting for you all to show your skills."

The purple-robed young man said: "Not at all, not at all." Applause and praise came from all sides.

Young heroes are very spirited. If their backgrounds and martial arts are similar, they admire each other and can quickly form a friendship.

Gu Nianjun had a faint smile on her face. Seeing the friendly atmosphere of the scene, and that the young man who took action was from a名门正派, she said: "I've long heard of the great name of the Jiu Mountain Sword Sect. Seeing it today, it truly lives up to its reputation."

(Ps: The plot in Feilong City has been laid out enough, and it will gradually unfold from now on!)
