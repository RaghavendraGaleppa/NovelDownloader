# Chapter 96: Annihilation of All Directions! The Calamity of World's End!

The ancestral lands of the Wan Clan in Linyuan Prefecture.

All members of the Wan Clan had dispersed, leaving only outsiders behind.

At this moment, Li Zhengjing sat in the highest seat, with the Vajra Temple’s Buddha Child seated beside him.

Gu Changzhou stood below, silent for a long while before finally raising his head and speaking: "My coming to the Wan Clan of Linyuan was not merely to hide my identity and seek refuge here, nor was it solely to find a way out for the Wan Clan."

"Now everyone knows that," Li Zhengjing nodded and continued, "Why don’t you tell us something we don’t know?"

"Who is behind that paper crane?" the Buddha Child asked.

"I don’t know. Before Elder Wan died, he only mentioned that if I came to the Wan Clan of Linyuan, an ancient being would come to retrieve the token I hold," Gu Changzhou spread his hands.

"An ancient being?" Li Zhengjing and the Buddha Child exchanged glances.

"This was also the first time I heard Elder Wan mention it," Gu Changzhou sighed. "After arriving here, I heard that the Great Zhou Dynasty intends to target the Luofu Immortal Sect, likely using the matter of the Dragon Pillar of the Hall as an excuse. That’s why I invited the Buddha Child here as a precaution. If the Dragon Pillar is indeed to be used, then the task of delivering the token to that ancient being will fall to the Buddha Child..."

"What exactly is this token?" the Buddha Child couldn’t help but ask.

"I don’t know," Gu Changzhou replied helplessly.

"Three questions, three 'I don’t knows'?" Li Zhengjing rubbed his chin. "Your lips are tighter than the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother’s."

"He truly doesn’t know," the Buddha Child turned his head, holding up a Buddhist bead. "His words show no fluctuation, and his heart is at peace. I tested him with this Buddhist treasure—he speaks no lies."

"Then you must at least know the origin of this token?" Li Zhengjing suddenly asked.

"..."

Gu Changzhou fell silent, offering no response.

He did know, but clearly, he was unwilling to speak directly.

Yet, he looked up at the Dragon Pillar of the Hall in Li Zhengjing’s hand and recalled the earlier paper crane, which evidently had prior dealings with Li Zhengjing.

With a sigh, he said, "Before the Creditor attacked, the Sect Master, for some reason, undertook a great task that left him severely injured. When the Creditor arrived, he had no strength to resist and was killed on the spot."

"What great task?"

Li Zhengjing stood up, his eyes blazing.

The Buddha Child pondered and said, "Earlier, the head of our Vajra Temple’s Arhat Hall mentioned that the Luofu Immortal Sect’s Sect Master was one of the most powerful beings in the world. Even if the Creditor descended, he shouldn’t have been killed in a single encounter. It seems... there was indeed another reason."

"He sought to divine the secrets of heaven!"

Gu Changzhou’s expression was grave. "The Sect Master suffered backlash and was severely injured. Even the Daoist Divination Compass, passed down in our sect for three thousand years, shattered! The result of his divination was sealed in a jade box, preserved with an ancient sealing method..."

The atmosphere in the room grew even heavier.

"Before Elder Wan died, did he tell you anything about the secrets of heaven?"

"He didn’t know either," Gu Changzhou said. "He only mentioned that after the Sect Master sealed the jade box, he ordered Elder Wan to personally deliver it to Linyuan Prefecture. Shortly after, the Creditor arrived..."

"Was there a traitor in the Luofu Immortal Sect?" Yuan Zhengfeng murmured. "Otherwise, how could the Creditor have known the sect’s exact situation and chosen the moment when the Sect Master was weakened by backlash to strike?"

"Perhaps... the Sect Master’s divination was guided by the Creditor?" Li Zhengjing thought. "Elder Yuan, have you forgotten? On the day we ambushed the Creditor in the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven, the Luofu Immortal Sect was attacked... The Creditor hadn’t acted for centuries, yet these two events happened on the same day. Can that be mere coincidence?"

"That makes sense," Yuan Zhengfeng fell silent.

"Enough, what’s done is done. I must set off for the capital."

Li Zhengjing stood, looking at the Dragon Pillar of the Hall in his hand and pondering for a moment.

The fake medicine peddler’s identity was a mystery. So far, he had only deceived Li Zhengjing during their first encounter. Since then, he had been a proper business partner.

Glancing at the golden page’s fortune-telling, Li Zhengjing saw no danger in carrying the Dragon Pillar, so he stored it away.

"Since the Dragon Pillar is now in my hands, you are free of your burden."

Li Zhengjing put it away and looked at Gu Changzhou. "Let’s be clear—I’m doing you a favor by taking this off your hands. Earlier, I also helped you kill the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother, averting divine punishment. And the fake medicine peddler is renting my cave heaven—this is his payment. So, don’t consider this a personal debt. Don’t contact me if you have issues, and don’t contact me if you don’t."

The Buddha Child looked at Gu Changzhou. "What will you do now? Return to the sect and compete for the position of Dao Child?"

"I can’t return to Luofu, nor can I compete for Dao Child."

Gu Changzhou’s expression was complicated as he sighed. "Comprehending the Jade Wall’s divine abilities carries risks. The four elders were protecting me when the Creditor attacked. They sensed the disturbance first and left the cave heaven immediately—only to perish!"

He spread his hands. "I no longer have the support of the elders, and my abilities aren’t enough to surpass my two senior brothers. The position of Dao Child is beyond my reach now."

"Fate plays tricks, destiny dictates. Before leaving, I wrote to the Grand Elder, explaining the stakes and asking him to expel me from the sect, cutting all ties cleanly."

With a self-deprecating smile, he added, "Ironically, on the day I left the mountain, I was ambushed by elders from our own sect. Two junior brothers from the Wan Clan died protecting me. But once news of my expulsion spread, no one came to kill me anymore..."

"Pitiable..."

The Buddha Child fell silent for a moment. "Without the Luofu Immortal Sect’s backing, your strength at the True Qi realm won’t intimidate others. I’ll accompany you to the Profound Origin Sword Sect. As for the matter of the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother’s death today..."

Both their gazes turned to Li Zhengjing.

"Fine, fine. So, I’ll take the blame for slaying a god. Let the Unpredictable Venerable bear the charge!" Li Zhengjing shrugged.

"Unpredictable Venerable?" The two exchanged puzzled glances.

"If the imperial court investigates, just say it was the Unpredictable Venerable’s doing." Li Zhengjing took out the Ghost Mask of Unpredictability and tossed it lightly. "After leaving Linyuan, I’ll use the Unpredictable Venerable’s identity to wield the Dragon Pillar elsewhere, clearing your name."

"And the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother’s body..." the Buddha Child said. "What will you do with it?"

"Let me think about it. I’ll give you an answer later."

Li Zhengjing waved his hand and headed to the backyard.

In the backyard, the Wall-Climbing Bird’s mood had improved slightly. It muttered, "The White Phoenix Divine Bird clan is auspicious. Since the elder hasn’t perished but is only hanging by a thread, he must still be alive..."

With that thought, it flew off to find the Dragon Girl.

This little girl seemed young but was terrifyingly powerful—she easily subdued the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother and even tore down the paper crane. She was a thicker thigh to cling to than even its master.

At the moment, the girl had tossed the Heavenly Balance Divine Wheel aside, much to the bird’s delight. The artifact was a high-grade treasure—if it could trick her out of it... no, if it could trade for it, that would be ideal.

The Dragon Girl loved pastries, so the bird brought some and chatted with her about various foods.

The Wall-Climbing Bird believed the finest thing in the world was spirit wine.

The Dragon Girl blinked and spoke in an obscure ancient tongue.

The bird listened carefully and heard her say, "Roasted meat is delicious. The best food in my homeland is roasted bird—skewered on a bamboo stick from the rear to the neck, marinated for an hour, rotated over a fire, brushed with honey, sprinkled with spices, sizzling with oil... But I haven’t had it in so many years..."

As she spoke, she grew sorrowful, tears falling as she sobbed softly.

"..."

The Wall-Climbing Bird suddenly felt a chill run down its spine and a phantom pain in its rear. Hearing her sudden wail, its vision went white, nearly fainting in terror. "Oh no! The bird lord’s been ambushed! If I pass out now, I’ll wake up sizzling on a skewer..."

Its vision darkened, and it sensed nothing more.

Meanwhile, the Five Elements Creation Tree crawled out of its wooden box with the Wave-Severing Gu and approached the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother’s statue, sighing.

"Second Brother, from now on, you might have to call her 'Elder Sister' instead of 'Elder Brother.'"

"Shut up! I haven’t decided yet!" Yuan Zhengfeng snapped.

A complete divine body was exceedingly rare.

When gods perished, it was usually due to their souls reaching the end of their lifespan, decaying naturally and willingly leaving behind their intact forms.

In battles where gods were slain, their bodies were often shattered, making complete preservation impossible.

This one, however, remained intact—Li Zhengjing hadn’t broken it. The Heavenly Balance King’s divine power had been extinguished when the Great Zhou’s high-ranking figures manipulated the faith energy. Thus, the body was whole!

This left Yuan Zhengfeng in a dilemma.

Had he possessed a divine body back then, he wouldn’t have needed to hide in a broken jade and slumber for years.

Back in the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven, when the Five Elements Creation Tree shattered the Creditor’s divine body, he had lamented the loss. But in that critical moment, if the Creditor’s body hadn’t been broken, he could have recovered and slaughtered them all.

Now, with this intact divine body before him, if he took it, he would become a god—no longer needing to borrow Li Zhengjing’s body or rely on the Five Elements Creation Tree.

But the drawbacks were equally glaring.

"This divine body was known as the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother, worshipped by the southern people for two thousand years..."

Yuan Zhengfeng murmured, "If I enter it, I’ll be bound to the Southern Domain, taking on the divine duty of love and desire. I won’t be able to leave the Southern Domain easily. Soon, the Great Zhou Dynasty will come for me..."

He looked at Li Zhengjing. "If I don’t submit, the Great Zhou will destroy me. If I do submit, I’ll become the new Southern Domain’s Divine Mother, bound by the court’s faith energy—just like the Heavenly Balance King, handing my life over to the Great Zhou!"

There was another, even more critical point.

The Heavenly Balance King had once been fierce and warlike, but after becoming the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother, he lost all his masculine vigor—even developing an attraction to Li Zhengjing, a mere youth!

"If I become the Divine Mother, subjected to the faith energy and the collective will of the people, will I still be myself after a hundred years?"

Yuan Zhengfeng whispered, "Perhaps a century later, I’ll be the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother—no longer Yuan Zhengfeng."

Li Zhengjing had anticipated this. "So, have you made your choice?"

Yuan Zhengfeng said, "Next time we go to the Southern Wasteland, we’ll look for another divine body—preferably an unworked Heavenly Domain Divine Stone. It’s purest and won’t affect me as much."

Li Zhengjing rubbed his chin. "Then you’ll stay in the broken jade for now."

The Five Elements Creation Tree sighed in disappointment. "No daughter for me."

Yuan Zhengfeng snapped, "What’s wrong with a son?"

He then urged Li Zhengjing to take the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother’s body—it might fetch a high price later.

Meanwhile, in the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven...

The fake medicine peddler held a jade box in his hand.

Earlier, his paper crane had been seized by the Dragon Girl, forcing him to abandon it.

But the jade box had been retrieved through his divine ability.

"News from the Netherworld speaks of a celestial star descending."

The fake medicine peddler rubbed his smooth chin, mimicking Li Zhengjing’s mannerism. "Yet the Luofu Sect Master’s divination revealed ten celestial stars descending together?"

He massaged his temples and sighed. "That reckless old bastard acted too ruthlessly for the sake of harvesting opportunities. Killing the Luofu Sect Master outright was like blinding me—how am I to divine the heavens now?"

Closing the jade box, he sat on the ground and muttered, "Now I only know of the ten celestial stars, not their arrangement. If it were a normal celestial descent, I could handle it. But if they form the Annihilation of All Directions formation, it’ll be a world-ending calamity—even I’d have to flee back to the Netherworld!"

He looked up at the sky, his gaze darkening. "Ten celestial stars falling at once... It seems the old man couldn’t hold the line after all."
