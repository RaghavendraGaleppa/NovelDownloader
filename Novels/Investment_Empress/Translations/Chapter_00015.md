## Chapter 15: Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body - Didn't He Just Learn Boxing Yesterday?

The next day.

The sky was bright. In the training hall, Xiao Qin limped in, his face pale, his breath shallow, clearly looking injured.

"Xiao Qin still dares to come today..."

"He was beaten so badly yesterday, his injuries probably haven't fully healed yet."

"Alas, if it were the old Xiao Qin, he could beat Wang Hu senseless with one hand. I wonder what happened to him."

"If he's still like this in half a year, he'll probably be asked to leave Qingyuan Sect, right?"

A few disciples whispered, their tones filled with regret. When they saw the brothers Wang Hu and Wang Hao walk in, they immediately fell silent.

"You trash, you still dare to come today."

"Excellent, I like tough bones who don't cry until they see the coffin."

Wang Hu smiled with interest, rubbing his fists together.

Thump—

Xiao Qin, dragging his injured body, practiced his punches one by one, ignoring Wang Hu's words.

*Junior Brother Li, didn't come today? It seems he listened to his advice. Alas, it's a pity, he had a reason he couldn't miss. Half a year, just another half a year, and he would be expelled from the sect. His Qi and blood had been declining repeatedly, and he could only place his hopes on his boxing techniques.*

"Senior Brother Xiao, are you injured?" Hearing the voice, Xiao Qin couldn't help but turn his head. After seeing the newcomer, he was stunned. "Li Mo?"

Everyone else was also stunned. He really dared to come? Yesterday, Wang Hu had already made it clear that if Li Mo dared to show up again, he would 'spar' with him. Wang Hu had been practicing martial arts and boxing for a long time. Li Mo, being a true disciple, certainly had excellent talent, but he had no martial arts foundation and had only just begun to touch upon martial arts.

Did he think that as a true disciple, being scared off by an outer disciple would make him lose face? But if he was beaten black and blue, wouldn't that be even more embarrassing?

"Good, good, good, it seems you think I wouldn't dare to seek guidance from a true disciple." Wang Hu narrowed his eyes, shifting his target to Li Mo. His aura became dangerous. Towards Xiao Qin, he had been more playful. Towards Li Mo, it was pure hatred.

He looked up at his cousin. "Don't do anything against the rules," Wang Hao said indifferently.

"Of course," Wang Hu grinned. Meaning, within the rules, he could do whatever he pleased?

He Hongfeng frowned. Couldn't this Wang Hu just calm down? These brothers had joined the sect late; hadn't they seen the formidable Elder Shang Wu? However, since they weren't breaking any rules, he couldn't say much.

"Stop standing around, practice your punches!" The outer disciples each began practicing their boxing techniques, while Wang Hao taught the Six Harmonies Fist to the new outer disciples. Looking at his movements, there was a sense of natural fluidity, clearly indicating several years of mastery in the Six Harmonies Fist.

But at this moment, everyone in the training hall wasn't really focused on their practice. Something might happen later!

"You shouldn't have come." Xiao Qin said with a serious face, his thick brows furrowed.

"You got beaten up yesterday, didn't you still come today?" Li Mo smiled indifferently.

Xiao Qin sighed, "I have my own reasons for having to come..."

"I do too."

"Huh?"

Xiao Qin was startled, unsure what to say. Indeed, although they hadn't known each other long, it was clear that Junior Brother Li was easygoing, not the type to be competitive or insist on proving a point.

"Senior Brother Xiao, take this. Consider it a thank you for teaching me yesterday." Li Mo pulled out a jade box and handed it over.

"The Six Harmonies Fist isn't some divine martial art, so it's not really... huh?!" As Xiao Qin spoke, before he had even fully opened the box, his pupils suddenly contracted. He recognized what was inside. Profound Crystal!

"Don't make a fuss, just you and I know." Li Mo put a finger to his lips, signaling him to be discreet.

"Junior Brother Li, this... I can't take this!" "Moreover, such a treasure has miraculous effects when used for any martial art; you should use it yourself!"

Xiao Qin quickly closed the box, lowering his voice.

"My constitution is special; I can't use it." Li Mo's smile held a bit more sincerity. He had clearly seen a flash of desire in Xiao Qin's eyes just now, but Xiao Qin had restrained himself. Not only did he decline, but he also warned Li Mo, fearing he didn't know the value of the Profound Crystal. *Old Xiao was a reliable guy.*

"That won't do either, this is too valuable." Xiao Qin still firmly refused.

"If you feel uneasy taking it, consider it a loan from me; you can return it when you have the chance." "As the first friend I've made since entering the sect, refusing again would be disrespectful, you know."

Li Mo directly slapped the box into his hand. "Friend..."

Xiao Qin stood rooted to the spot, clutching the box in a daze. He used to have friends in Qingyuan Sect, but that was when his talent was still recognized. After he lost his halo as a genius and was demoted from the inner sect to the outer sect, those so-called friends, let alone offering help in tough times, were already good if they didn't kick him while he was down. And Junior Brother Li had only learned boxing from him for one day.

This Profound Crystal might change his fate! Because in that instant, the jade pendant on his chest had a strong reaction.

"Take it, Senior Brother Xiao, your situation needs it," Li Mo urged again. After struggling for a moment. "The kindness of this day, I will never forget it in this life."

Xiao Qin didn't give a long speech of thanks, nor did he ask why Li Mo believed he would be able to repay him in the future. He merely clasped his fist firmly, his eyes resolute. Everything was conveyed without words.

"Then I won't be polite when I need your help in the future." Li Mo patted his shoulder. *Looking at this fellow's gaze, he probably wouldn't even bat an eye risking his life for him in the future. A purple destiny, huh. His cheap master also had a purple destiny, and was now the youngest elder of Qingyuan Sect. One investment, not only gaining the friendship of a future strong individual, but also receiving system feedback. A triple win. He won twice; he was absolutely crushing it.*

*"They say more friends mean more paths." "If I keep investing like this, when they grow up, won't I be the most influential person in the entire Great Yu Dynasty?" Li Mo couldn't help but let his thoughts wander, classic tropes appearing in his mind. A true disciple of Qingyuan Sect returns home to find his father living in a dog kennel. With a single command, ten thousand powerhouses descend from the sky... From now on, call me Li Mo, user of the Face-Face Fruit. The scene was too beautiful. Oh, right, there were also rewards.*

Xiao Qin still wanted to continue teaching Li Mo the Six Harmonies Fist, but Li Mo shook his head and politely declined, simply sitting to the side. While sipping tea, he checked his investment feedback.

[Congratulations, Host, you have successfully invested: one Profound Crystal.]
[Investment Feedback: "Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body"]

["Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body" (Ultimate Art)]: "Using the sharp killing aura of weapons to temper one's body, proving the undefeated body of the ultimate path. When successful, all weapons will submit, the physical body will be unparalleled, and the power of any weapon used will be doubled!"

The complete martial art flooded into his mind, and Li Mo instantly knew it by heart. He closed his eyes, carefully reading and memorizing.

This was actually a body-tempering martial art. And it could even increase one's ability to wield weapons!

"This cultivation method requires using the killing aura of weapons to temper oneself." Li Mo pondered. "Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body," just by its name, sounded murderous. But this was absolutely not a wicked path; instead, it was an extremely pure and refined body-tempering technique. It was very perilous and difficult to master. But the benefits after mastering it far outweighed the difficulty and danger!

Li Mo decided... to practice it! *One wanders the jianghu, how can one avoid getting cut? Even the best armor couldn't compare to one's own strength. For his own safety, he had to master it.*

"Are there any places within the sect where the sharp killing aura of weapons is strong?"

Unknowingly. The training hall stopped teaching boxing. It was free practice time. This meant that free sparring was also allowed.

"True Disciple Li, you don't have a woman protecting you today, do you?" Wang Hu sneered, clenching his fists until they cracked. His eyes were bloodshot, looking as if he wanted to devour the young man opposite him alive.

He Hongfeng felt something was wrong. However, just as he was about to get up to stop it, Wang Hao pressed down on his hand. "Junior Brother Wang, if something really happens, neither you nor I can bear the responsibility," He Hongfeng said gravely. Wang Hao narrowed his eyes and sneered, "Don't worry, my cousin knows how to hold back, and besides, he's only in the Qi Blood Realm. If there's any problem, you can stop it at any time." "Within the rules, don't interfere." "Alright then." He Hongfeng hesitated for a moment, thinking it made sense. His internal energy had reached the Great Zhou Heaven Realm; as long as he paid attention, someone in the Qi Blood Realm couldn't cause much trouble under his watch.

"Wang Hu!" Xiao Qin moved his feet, actually getting up and walking directly towards him. He seemed to intend to 'spar' with Wang Hu first. *Old Xiao was really trying to do something.* But someone was faster than him. Xiao Qin only heard the whoosh of wind past his ear. Wang Hu only saw a black blur rapidly enlarging in his eyes. It was a fist!

Thud—

Almost all the outer disciples present hadn't even reacted yet. Just as they came to their senses, they heard a dull thud. Wang Hu stumbled backward, finally landing on his backside on the ground. The shock on his face hadn't even had time to fade. He opened his mouth, but no words came out; the pain in his ribs made it impossible to breathe. A bone seemed to have cracked.

"You're too weak; sparring with you, I'm afraid I wouldn't learn anything." Li Mo spoke indifferently, a faint smile still on his face. Beside him, Xiao Qin's jaw had dropped. Six Harmonies Fist? This, this wasn't right, Junior Brother Li only just learned boxing yesterday! And wasn't he just starting to cultivate? Where did he get so much strength?
