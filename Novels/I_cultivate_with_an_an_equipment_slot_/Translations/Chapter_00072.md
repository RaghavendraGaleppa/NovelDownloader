# Chapter 72: Zhang Yan: You Have No Idea How Talented I Am!

Mu Sen, being from the Wood Spirit Peak, was naturally a spiritual planter. This was precisely why his assessment of Zhang Yan's spiritual garden was more professional. The cost of this spiritual garden was undoubtedly substantial. What made him particularly envious was that, apart from the ordinary first-grade spiritual plants, Zhang Yan's garden actually contained four second-grade spiritual plants! He recognized at a glance that these plants came from the sect leader's spiritual garden, leaving him with nothing but envy and resentment.

"Wait, why do you have a Serene Heart Lotus here?!" Mu Sen's usually wooden expression finally cracked, unable to maintain its usual composure. The Serene Heart Lotus was a third-grade spiritual plant, and even among third-grade plants, it was exceptionally rare. Yet here it was, growing in Zhang Yan's garden.

"It's just a newly cultivated one, still far from maturity," Zhang Yan chuckled. His senior brother was making too big a deal out of it—it was just a third-grade spiritual plant!

"Newly cultivated? You cultivated it yourself?" Mu Sen felt as if the sky had fallen. Had his junior brother already become this capable? Wasn't he supposed to be his guide? How could Zhang Yan already be cultivating third-grade spiritual plants? This was too outrageous!

"Senior Brother, I called you here because the sect has tasked me with cultivating ten first-grade superior spiritual plants and one second-grade plant. But I think cultivating first-grade superior plants isn't very useful. Why not cultivate ten second-grade superior plants instead? However, I can't handle it alone and need your help with the groundwork."

Sect missions generally didn't allow outside assistance, but tasks like reconnaissance for hunting demonic beasts or groundwork for spiritual plant cultivation were exceptions, as the entire process could be recorded with memory stones.

"Why would the sect assign you to cultivate spiritual plants? Shouldn't they ask us, the Foundation Establishment-stage spiritual planters?" Mu Sen asked, puzzled.

"It's nothing much—just my test to become a True Disciple," Zhang Yan said nonchalantly.

*Snap!*

A sapling in Mu Sen's hand suddenly broke.

"What happened?" Zhang Yan asked, heartbroken. That sapling had cost money!

"What did you say? A True Disciple test? You're going to become a True Disciple?!" Mu Sen felt a pang of bitterness in his heart. He remembered not long ago when he was still guiding Zhang Yan in spell cultivation, and now, in the blink of an eye, Zhang Yan was about to become a True Disciple! This was unbelievable! A True Disciple! Once Zhang Yan achieved that, wouldn't he have to address him as "Senior Brother True Disciple"? This was sheer madness!

---

Cultivating ten second-grade spiritual plants wasn't easy. Even with Mu Sen's assistance, it would take some time. While working on the plants, Zhang Yan didn't idle around. He decided to visit the sect's Golden Core elders. The first person he visited was none other than Lei Kunhai.

Zhang Yan was quite familiar with Lei Kunhai's Thousand Treasures Peak. Back when he was earning spirit stones, he had come here to crack open raw ores. Thinking back, that had been quite fun. When he arrived at the peak's entrance, a female cultivator exclaimed in surprise and approached him. "Junior Brother, it's been a while. Are you here to crack ores again?"

"Senior Sister Zhao, I'm not here for ore cracking this time. I've come to pay my respects to the Peak Master."

This Senior Sister Zhao was the same one who had assisted Zhang Yan during his previous ore-cracking visits. He hadn't expected her to still be working here after all this time.

"You want to see the Peak Master?" Senior Sister Zhao was taken aback. The Peak Master was a Golden Core cultivator—not someone one could just meet on a whim.

"Yes, Peak Master Lei should already be expecting me. Could you please inform him that Zhang Yan from the Wood Spirit Peak has come to pay his respects?"

"Of course, please wait a moment, Junior Brother." Senior Sister Zhao hurried inside to relay the message. Before long, she returned with a complicated expression and said respectfully, "Senior Brother, the Peak Master will see you."

"Thank you, Senior Sister." Zhang Yan didn't mind her change in attitude. Given his current strength, it was only natural for her to be cautious.

Entering Thousand Treasures Peak, Zhang Yan made his way to a cave dwelling—Lei Kunhai's residence. The door was tightly shut, as if unwelcoming. Undeterred, Zhang Yan bowed respectfully and announced, "Disciple Zhang Yan has come to pay his respects to Peak Master Lei."

With a creak, the door swung open, revealing a burly young man. The young man was handsome but had a bruised and swollen face, looking rather pitiful. For some reason, Zhang Yan felt the young man was glaring at him as if he were a mortal enemy.

"So you're Zhang Yan!" the young man spat through gritted teeth.

"I am Zhang Yan. May I ask how to address you, Senior Brother?" Seeing that the other was at the Foundation Establishment stage and adorned with treasures, Zhang Yan knew he must be someone important and quickly bowed.

"I am Lei Wanbao. Come in—my great-grandfather wants to see you." Lei Wanbao shot Zhang Yan a venomous glare. He really wanted to know what was so special about this guy that his doting great-grandfather had beaten him up over him.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Zhang Yan followed him inside.

Lei Kunhai's cave dwelling was different from those of Zhuge Wan and Mo Changqing. His was rugged yet luxurious, decorated in a primitive style but filled with gemstones, pearls, and magical artifacts. Inside, Zhang Yan saw an even more imposing elderly man seated on a meditation mat, staring intently at a table covered with high-quality raw ores.

"Disciple Zhang Yan pays his respects to Peak Master Lei."

Lei Kunhai remained motionless, frowning at the ores before him, clearly stumped.

"Disciple believes the ore on the left is promising." Remembering Zhuge Wan's advice to make a good impression, Zhang Yan spoke up without hesitation.

"Oh? The one on the left has cracks—it's unlikely to retain spiritual energy. Why do you think it's the best?" Lei Kunhai looked up, his presence as formidable as a lion's.

"Although the left ore has cracks, they aren't deep. The outer layer is intact, and there's a faint glow of treasure. There must be something inside." Zhang Yan had spent considerable time in the ore-cracking field and had developed a keen eye. Well, actually, it was thanks to the descriptions on his ore-cracking tool. He had simply mastered interpreting them.

"Good, let's see." Lei Kunhai used his hand like a blade and effortlessly split the ore open. Zhang Yan was stunned. Ore-cracking was a delicate art—that was why Thousand Treasures Peak had specialized disciples and tools for it. Beginners couldn't even attempt it without careful preparation. Yet Lei Kunhai had done it barehanded—truly terrifying.

As the ore split, its contents were revealed. Just as Zhang Yan had predicted, there was indeed treasure inside—though it was only a minor trinket.

"You can appraise ores?" Lei Kunhai seemed slightly pleased.

"I know a little," Zhang Yan replied modestly.

"Not bad. Zhuge Wan really found herself a good disciple. But she mentioned you've mastered four spells to perfection. Is that true?"

"Please enlighten me, Peak Master." Zhang Yan demonstrated several spells, all perfected.

"Four perfected spells indeed!" Lei Kunhai fell silent. Suddenly, he turned to Lei Wanbao, who was also awestruck, and his previously suppressed anger flared up again. "What are you staring at? If only you were half as capable as him! How did I end up with such a useless great-grandson?"

Lei Kunhai's massive palm descended on Lei Wanbao, and Zhang Yan finally understood where the latter's injuries had come from.

After a thorough beating, Lei Kunhai calmly returned to his seat and said, "You're impressive. I approve of your promotion to True Disciple. However, you'll accompany me to the Ancient Battlefield. We need to acquire some ores there, and you'll be well compensated."

"At Peak Master's command." Glancing at the battered Lei Wanbao, Zhang Yan felt he had no choice but to agree.

"Good. What reward do you want?" Lei Kunhai was straightforward and disliked beating around the bush. He was pleased with Zhang Yan's decisiveness.

"Peak Master, I've long admired Thousand Treasures Peak's renowned artifact-forging techniques. I'd like to learn a bit about them."

"Artifact forging? You want to learn that?" Lei Kunhai was taken aback. "Aren't you a spiritual planter?"

"Who says a spiritual planter can't be an artifact forger?" Zhang Yan was confused. Was there such a rule in the cultivation world?

"No such rule. But forging requires talent. I don't know if you have it. Still, since I promised, here's a forging manual. Study it. If you show promise, I won't mind teaching you."

Lei Kunhai handed Zhang Yan a jade slip.

"Thank you, Peak Master!" Zhang Yan examined its properties:

**[Equipment Name]**: Forging Manual  
**[Equipment Grade]**: None  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Purple  
**[Equipment Effects]**: Mastery in Sword Forging, Mastery in Shield Artifacts, Proficiency in Hammer Artifacts, +40% Forging Experience.

"Thank you, Peak Master! I won't let you down!" Zhang Yan grinned at the jade slip's attributes.
