# Chapter 160: Testing and Agreement

"Little friend, fighting is forbidden in Baiyan City—this has been the rule for many years. Since he struck first and you killed his spirit snake as punishment, let's consider this matter settled, shall we?"

The elderly man was tall and imposing, his eyes seeming to flicker with flames, exuding an intimidating presence. Though his tone toward Gu Yuan was gentle, it still carried an authoritative edge.

"Since Senior has intervened, this matter is naturally settled."

Gu Yuan clasped his hands and bowed slightly.

When under another's roof, one must bow their head.

The old man before him was none other than the Daoist Wu, one of Baiyan City's four late-stage Foundation Establishment protectors. He practiced mysterious and unpredictable arcane arts, his methods unfathomable. Having dominated the Myriad Isles Sea for three hundred years, his strength was formidable, and he had the entire Baiyan City backing him. Given Gu Yuan's current strength, it was unwise to provoke trouble—especially since he still needed Baiyan City's resources and platform.

Pleased with Gu Yuan's response, the old man smiled and said, "Thank you for your understanding, young friend. However, our Xuanjin Hall also bears some responsibility in this matter. As compensation, I can waive all commission fees for your current bounty."

"Many thanks, Senior!"

Gu Yuan bowed again.

Xuanjin Hall's profits came from taking a cut from both bounty posters and bounty hunters. The tasks posted here were never small, and even a five percent commission could accumulate into a substantial sum over time.

Though the exact value of the "Forbidden Thunder Seal of Exorcism" was uncertain, it was undoubtedly worth several thousand spirit stones. By waiving the fee, the old man had effectively saved Gu Yuan hundreds, if not thousands, of spirit stones.

A few hundred spirit stones might not be a fortune, but it wasn't insignificant either. For Gu Yuan at this stage, it was hardly a concern, but it was Xuanjin Hall's gesture of goodwill, and he had no choice but to accept it.

"Very well, I won't disturb your discussions any further. The bounty poster is already waiting in the first-class chamber. You may speak freely."

With a chuckle, the old man's figure blurred into black smoke and vanished.

Gu Yuan turned to survey the hall. The pair of bright eyes he had seen earlier in the darkness were indeed gone, leaving only the other Foundation Establishment cultivators staring at him with lingering fear.

Picking up the jade scroll containing the mission details, Gu Yuan strode toward the first-class chamber.

---

The first-class chamber was small, constructed entirely of white jade stone. A large luminous pearl embedded in the ceiling cast bright light, illuminating every corner.

Two stone tables stood on either side of the chamber. Seated behind the left table was a figure draped in a black robe.

The robe was loose, concealing the wearer's figure, but subtle movements betrayed a graceful femininity. Combined with the earlier glimpse of those bright eyes, there was no doubt—this was a woman.

**Boom!**

The moment Gu Yuan stepped inside, a bolt of lightning shot toward him.

**Clang!**

With a mere thought, his sword light surged forth, matching the lightning's speed. With a sharp, unyielding slash, the bolt was shattered.

Yet thunder rumbled like an impending storm, and countless new lightning bolts crackled into existence, twisting into the form of a thunderous dragon that lunged at Gu Yuan.

His sword light split and weaved like a nimble serpent, effortlessly intercepting and slicing through the lightning no matter how it attacked.

With a mid-grade spirit sword and eighteen sword lights at his command, Gu Yuan's prowess was unmatched among early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. The lightning, no matter how it transformed, was no match for his blade, dissipating into scattered wisps of spiritual energy.

"Your skills are impressive, Daoist Brother. My apologies for testing you."

As the lightning faded, the black-robed woman did not press further. Instead, she rose and bowed gracefully.

"Given the importance of finding your father, caution is understandable."

Gu Yuan wasn't angered. He sheathed his sword light and returned the courtesy.

The woman's attack had merely been a test. Perhaps the matter was too critical—even after witnessing Gu Yuan's abilities in the hall, she had to verify them personally before proceeding.

"Thank you for your understanding. The stakes are indeed high, and I had no choice. But with your extraordinary swordsmanship, our chances of success have improved."

The black-robed woman sighed, her voice tinged with exhaustion.

"I've accepted the mission, and with Xuanjin Hall's guarantee, could you clarify the exact nature of this bounty?"

Gu Yuan placed the jade scroll on the table and looked at her.

While he desired the Thunder Seal and the potential opportunities tied to this mission, he still needed to assess the risks before committing.

"To be honest, Daoist Brother, I'm not entirely certain of the dangers we might face."

The woman gave a bitter smile before continuing, "Two months ago, my father and a close friend ventured out to mine a spirit ore for refining artifacts. Then, they suddenly vanished. At first, I didn't think much of it—my father often traveled, sometimes for years at a time. But half a month ago, his soul lamp flickered dangerously, its light dimming to near-extinction. That was when I realized something terrible must have happened."

"Using the soul lamp as a guide, I traced his last known location. However, it's a perilous place. Alone, I lack the confidence to venture in. That's why I posted this bounty, seeking a cultivator with exceptional combat skills to aid me."

**Soul lamp?**

Gu Yuan was surprised. Soul lamps were difficult to craft, requiring rare soul-related materials. Even inner disciples of major sects rarely had them. Yet this woman possessed one—what was her background?

The "Forbidden Thunder Seal of Exorcism" wasn't something an ordinary person could offer either.

After a moment's hesitation, the woman vaguely explained, "It's merely an inheritance from my ancestors..."

An inheritance? More like the last remnant of a destroyed sect from the Western Sea Region, or perhaps a lone survivor.

Gu Yuan understood but didn't press further. Instead, he asked, "What was your father's cultivation level? And his friend's?"

"My father was at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, just a step away from mid-stage. His friend was also at the early stage."

**Both at the early stage?**

Gu Yuan studied the black-robed woman, intrigued.

Father and daughter sharing the same cultivation realm was unusual.

But then again, if one's talent was lacking, being stuck at the early stage of Foundation Establishment for decades wasn't uncommon. That was enough time for a talented individual to catch up.

"My father practiced a unique cultivation method. Despite being at the early stage, his combat prowess far surpassed that of ordinary early-stage cultivators. As for me... I was merely fortunate to encounter a few fortuitous opportunities, allowing my cultivation to progress faster."

The woman added a clarification.

"Where exactly is this secret location?"

Gu Yuan pressed.

"Only after you confirm your assistance and sign a binding contract will I disclose the location."

The woman remained cautious.

"I need to see the Thunder Seal first."

After a brief consideration, Gu Yuan made his request.

Without refusal, the woman produced a jade slip and handed it to him.

Gu Yuan scanned it with his divine sense, and his eyes lit up with delight.

"And if we find spiritual treasures in the secret location?"

He asked another question.

"My priority is finding my father. Any treasures we discover can belong to you."

"Since we're working together, shouldn't we be open with each other? May I see your true appearance?"

Throughout their conversation, Gu Yuan still hadn't seen the woman's face. The black robe seemed to be a rare treasure—even with his Heavenly Eye and divine sense, he couldn't discern her features or aura.

Exploring a secret realm with someone whose face remained unknown was unsettling. If they were ambushed, he could suffer greatly.

The woman hesitated, seemingly taken aback by the request. But after a pause, she slowly removed her hood.

---

Instantly, the chamber seemed to brighten, as if spring had arrived.

A peerless beauty stood before him.
