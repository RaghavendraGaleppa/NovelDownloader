# Chapter 47: Stone Coffin and the Entwined Serpent Technique  

Murong Fan observed Qi Chuan's calm demeanor after the battle and frowned slightly, sensing something amiss.  

However, having been fully immersed in his own fierce struggle with the female Black Jade Spirit Snake, he had no way of knowing what had transpired on Qi Chuan's side. For now, he could only speculate.  

*Perhaps Brother Qi possesses exceptionally profound spiritual energy for someone at the fourth level of Qi Refinement, and that male Black Jade Spirit Snake was only comparable to an ordinary fourth-level cultivator...*  

Murong Fan mused silently.  

At the moment, it didn’t occur to him that Qi Chuan might have already reached the fifth level of Qi Refinement. After all, the opponent Qi Chuan had faced was merely a male Black Jade Spirit Snake equivalent to a fourth-level cultivator. Sometimes, a stronger fourth-level cultivator with superior techniques could achieve such a feat.  

Qi Chuan, however, paid little attention to Murong Fan’s thoughts. He simply waited quietly, keeping his distance from the weakened Murong Fan to avoid any misunderstandings.  

After swallowing a medicinal pill and absorbing spiritual energy from a low-grade spirit stone to restore his cultivation, Murong Fan soon recovered a portion of his spiritual energy.  

"Brother Qi, let’s enter the cave," Murong Fan said as he stood up, his eyes now gleaming with anticipation.  

"Very well," Qi Chuan nodded. It was time to see what lay inside.  

According to the treasure map, the hidden treasure was located within the cave ahead.  

The two of them proceeded from the middle of the fork in the path toward the end, where they cleared away some scattered rocks before jumping into the cave entrance.  

Inside, the cave branched out in all directions. Following the hints on the treasure map, they arrived at a passage deep within the cave. At the end of the passage, they found a small cold pool.  

"Who in the world would bury treasure beneath this?" Qi Chuan couldn’t help but mutter in exasperation as he gazed at the pool. According to the map, the treasure lay beneath its waters.  

"The cultivation world has its share of eccentric individuals," Murong Fan replied with a shake of his head. "When their lifespans near their end and they have no descendants, some take perverse pleasure in such arrangements. Of course, most cultivators would rather destroy their possessions than leave them for others."  

It was true that the cultivation world occasionally circulated treasure maps—some genuine, most fake. The one in Murong Fan’s hands, however, was a rare authentic one.  

Without further hesitation, Murong Fan produced several Fireball Talismans and used them to evaporate the cold pool.  

Qi Chuan assisted by forming a hand seal, causing the cracked mud at the bottom of the pool to part. Three zhang below, they uncovered a stone coffin.  

The sight of a stone coffin in such a place was somewhat unsettling.  

However, the coffin lid had long since shattered into several pieces, revealing its contents through the gaps. There were no dried corpses, bones, or blood—only ordinary cultivation resources.  

With a flick of his wrist, Murong Fan cast a Levitation Spell and descended to retrieve the items, laying them out on the ground.  

Now came the matter of dividing the spoils.  

After exchanging a glance, Qi Chuan and Murong Fan each picked up an ancient-looking manual and began perusing it.  

Before Qi Chuan could finish skimming through his, Murong Fan handed over the other manual.  

"This is a dual cultivation technique. Are you interested?" Murong Fan asked.  

"A dual cultivation technique?" Qi Chuan raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Let me see."  

He took the manual and flipped through it casually.  

**[You have briefly perused the *Entwined Serpent Technique* in an attempt to comprehend its basics. Triggering a double critical hit, you gain double rewards—your understanding of the *Entwined Serpent Technique* has slightly improved.]**  

As Qi Chuan finished reading, words flashed before his eyes, and fragments of knowledge about the *Entwined Serpent Technique* surfaced in his mind.  

From this partial understanding, he deduced that the *Entwined Serpent Technique* was indeed a decent dual cultivation method.  

However, much like his *Evergreen Art*, it was only suitable for the Qi Refinement stage. Once one reached the tenth level of Qi Refinement, the technique would reach its limit, necessitating a switch to a new method.  

If one had a cultivation partner of similar age, the *Entwined Serpent Technique* could accelerate cultivation progress compared to ordinary Qi Refinement techniques.  

But Qi Chuan was already practicing the *Evergreen Art*. Switching techniques would be too time-consuming and laborious. It made more sense to continue with the *Evergreen Art* until the tenth level before transitioning directly to a Foundation Establishment technique.  

"This dual cultivation technique is useless to me," Qi Chuan said, shaking his head as he returned the manual to Murong Fan.  

"You don’t want it? Then I’ll take it."  

Without hesitation, Murong Fan tucked the manual into his robe.  

"You..."  

Qi Chuan was taken aback. Murong Fan seemed like a straightforward person—why was he so interested in a dual cultivation technique?  

"Don’t misunderstand," Murong Fan said calmly, noticing Qi Chuan’s expression. "Compared to ordinary Qi Refinement techniques, this dual cultivation method offers faster progress without any apparent side effects. It doesn’t seem like a demonic art. If I bring it back to my clan, it might benefit some of our cultivators. Presenting a valuable technique like this would also earn me rewards from the family."  

"Ah, I see. My mistake," Qi Chuan said, realization dawning. He had jumped to the wrong conclusion.  

For most cultivation clans, the number of techniques in their possession was limited. Acquiring an additional method meant more options for their members. If a cultivator happened to find a technique that resonated with them, their progress could accelerate significantly.  

From this perspective, a cultivation technique was likely more valuable to a clan than a spell. After all, in the cultivation world, the foundation of everything was one’s cultivation level.  

With this in mind, Qi Chuan nodded in understanding.  

He then picked up the other ancient manual he had been examining earlier and began reading. Soon, he finished skimming through it.  

**[You have briefly perused *Clear Cave Spirit Eyes* in an attempt to comprehend its basics. Triggering a tenfold critical hit, you gain tenfold rewards—your understanding of *Clear Cave Spirit Eyes* has slightly improved.]**  

Words flashed before his eyes once more, accompanied by fragments of knowledge about *Clear Cave Spirit Eyes*.  

After absorbing this information, a flicker of astonishment crossed Qi Chuan’s eyes.  

"This... is an ocular technique?"
