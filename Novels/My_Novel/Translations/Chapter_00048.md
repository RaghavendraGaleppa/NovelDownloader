# Chapter 48: The Mistress Is Present, Hunting the Great Tiger

The woman rode in draped in a fox-fur cloak embroidered with auspicious longevity clouds. She sat atop a spirited, crimson-blooded steed that trod upon the snow. A sachet, a jade belt, and various exquisite ornaments adorned her. Her long hair was tied up, exuding a heroic and valiant air. Her beautiful face was radiant, looking as if she were a celestial being.

On the right side of her saddle hung a longbow, heavily decorated, the most eye-catching feature being a tiger-shaped yellow jade piece which she held in her hand, her fingers gently stroking the tiger’s head. On the left side were fifty "Lingyu" arrows.

A servant girl named Qiuyue walked ahead, holding the reins. Though her attire was also fine, standing beside the Mistress, she could only serve as a foil.

"The Mistress is participating as well," Li Xian thought to himself.

"Have the rules been clearly explained to them?" the Mistress, Lady Wen, asked calmly.

Pang Long replied respectfully, "They have been explained clearly."

"Very well, then let us begin," Lady Wen said. This so-called winter hunt was, in the end, just for her own amusement. The guards were merely supporting characters.

With these words, the Mistress squeezed her legs, and the crimson-blooded steed charged into the Bear and Tiger Mountain. The mountain was filled with miscellaneous branches and trees, but the steed moved as if on flat ground, vanishing in a few breaths.

The Bear and Tiger Mountain was a continuous range containing lakes, rivers, cliffs, and dense forests—a complete set of landforms. Otherwise, the Mistress would not have chosen it as a hunting ground.

The winter hunt lasted three days. However, in reality, many Grade D guards would be out in less than half a day. They mostly hunted wild rabbits and birds. The reward money was pitiful, but at least it could be used to stew a pot of meat, making for a full meal. It was about the experience.

The Mistress rode off into the distance.

Li Xian and the other guards naturally entered the forest one after another.

Besides the "Lingyu" arrows granted by the Mistress, he had also prepared two hundred regular arrows.

"I only have ten Lingyu arrows, meaning I can hunt at most ten creatures. I should aim for the big ones," Li Xian thought as he moved through the woods.

The terrain here was very complex, with difficult-to-traverse snow and dense forests.

Fortunately, Li Xian had mastered the "Treading on Snow" trait, which saved him a great deal of effort and trouble.

Suddenly, a wild rabbit jumped past.

Li Xian quickly nocked an arrow and shot it. The force was perfectly controlled, piercing the rabbit's heart and pinning it to the ground. The rabbit kicked its legs and died on the spot.

"Looks like there are plenty of prey here," Li Xian’s eyes lit up. He had originally worried that the mountain range had few prey and finding them would require great effort. But he had barely entered the mountain before seeing a wild rabbit.

Where there were wild rabbits, there were bound to be predators that preyed on them. From a small clue, one can see the whole picture; the resources in this forest were abundant!

"To truly hunt big game, I need to go deeper into the woods."

"Opportunity knocks but once. My martial arts may not be the strongest, but my hunting and archery skills are definitely not inferior to others."

"Work hard... killing three big bears isn't necessarily impossible!"

Li Xian moved toward the depths.

After walking for about two hours, he had penetrated deep into the interior. He could clearly feel that human traces nearby were much fewer. Many Grade D and Grade C guards had no intention of hunting big game. Naturally, they wouldn't venture deep, for in this primeval forest, anyone could become prey. Knowing when to retreat to save one's life was wise.

"Phew..."

Li Xian stopped and found a clearing. He gathered some dry firewood and lit a bonfire. He skinned and gutted the wild rabbit he had hunted in the morning and roasted it over the fire, maintaining his strength.

"Hunting isn't an urgent matter..."

"It's a pity the hunt only lasts three days. If it were longer, I could try setting traps," Li Xian mused as he gnawed on the rabbit meat. Without seasoning, it tasted like dry wood, but once in his stomach, it warmed him and restored some of his strength.

"Water source..."

After eating and drinking his fill, he naturally continued on his way. Li Xian saw a river and immediately beamed with joy. Wild beasts need to drink water too. As long as he guarded the water source, he was sure to see large prey.

"There are paw prints too. Judging by the depth and size... it's likely a great tiger!"

"It must weigh at least several hundred pounds!"

Li Xian was ecstatic. He hid in a patch of weeds and waited patiently.

Unfortunately, he didn't wait for the tiger but saw a wild deer instead. Hesitating for a moment, Li Xian shot it anyway. He first used a regular arrow to pierce the deer's heart. Then, he took out a "Lingyu" arrow and shot it again.

Deer blood gushed out. This was a great tonic, and Li Xian didn't want to waste it, so he drank the deer blood directly.

\[You have swallowed deer blood. Skill: Ingestion, Proficiency +5\]
\[Proficiency +2\]
\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Skill: Ingestion\]
\[Proficiency: 379/500 (Entry Level)\]

Li Xian looked like a beast, his mouth covered in blood. But the benefits were obvious. In his Dantian, his internal energy flowed out like a trickle, growing a bit stronger and more abundant.

"If only I could eat deer blood every day."

"I've heard that soaking in deer blood can also strengthen the flesh. It's just too extravagant. I can't even afford to drink it, let alone soak in it?"

Li Xian took out the "Flesh-Shrinking Bag." This object had a strange texture. When internal energy was channeled into it, it would become soft and could be stretched and enlarged at will. When the energy was withdrawn, it would gradually shrink until it was the size of a fist.

"The vast world is full of wonders."

"Even peeping at the moon from the bottom of a well, one can still see a thing or two."

He draped the bag over the deer's body, took three steps back, and the bag gradually shrank... until it was the size of a fist. A wild deer weighing over a hundred pounds was compressed to such a small size. To Li Xian's surprise, when he opened the bag again and took the deer out, its form was intact. It hadn't turned into a lump of meat or mud... The principle behind it was truly baffling, yet fascinating.

Suddenly, Li Xian rolled sharply to the right. A striped great tiger lunged at the spot where he had just been.

"That was close... I almost fell for it."

"In this forest, I am also prey," Li Xian narrowed his eyes, his expression calm. He swept his right leg through the snow, using the "Gentle Breeze Sways" move from the "Gentle Breeze Leg."

The wind from the kick blew the snow into the air, instantly blinding the tiger.

Although Li Xian's martial arts had improved greatly and his internal energy was refined, fighting a tiger bare-handed would still put him at a disadvantage. He immediately turned to run. The tiger roared and pounced. Li Xian dodged around a tree, channeling his internal energy to his legs and kicking off hard. He leaped a full zhang high, grabbed a vine, and swung himself away.

He flew through the air, turning in mid-flight, nocking his bow, and shooting. His fingers moved rapidly, firing three arrows in succession. The fierce tiger was no weakling; despite its massive size, it was incredibly agile. It twisted left and right, dodging two arrows, but the third was shot at a tricky angle. It was one of Li Xian's killing moves.

*Thud...*

The arrow pierced the tiger's leg. The great tiger, in pain, tried to flee. Li Xian cursed, "You beast, trying to run?"

He reached out and drew five arrows. However, the "Five Arrows Simultaneously" technique was hard to control accurately, and his arrows were limited, so he had to save them. Although he had five arrows nocked, he shot them one by one. The movements were fluid. Two arrows cut off its path, two were feints, and only the last one was infused with his internal energy... hiding a deadly chill.

Just as expected, although the tiger was cunning, it didn't know how to react to this kind of attack. It was hit by an arrow and collapsed in the snow.

The first great tiger was slain!
