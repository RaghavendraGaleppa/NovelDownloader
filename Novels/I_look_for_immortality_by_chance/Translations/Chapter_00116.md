# Chapter 116: Primordial Yang True Jade, All Preparations Complete!

In the grand hall, all the cultivators remained, silently awaiting the outcome of the secret realm competition. The disciples from the seven noble lineages sat with closed eyes, composed and confident, as if victory was already assured. Meanwhile, the common-born disciples wore grave expressions, their anxiety palpable.

"Do you think Senior Brother Gu can secure several strands of spiritual energy?" one of the common-born disciples finally whispered after the prolonged wait.

"Senior Brother Gu defeated the Azure Wood Profound Spirit with such ease—his strength is extraordinary. At the very least, he should be able to obtain two or more strands," another replied hesitantly.

"I hope he can secure a strand of the Lunar Moonlight Essence. That would give us some hope for Foundation Establishment," sighed another, his voice trembling with worry.

The spiritual energies required for Foundation Establishment were mostly found in secret realms controlled by various sects and families. Without the backing of a powerful faction, obtaining even a single strand was as difficult as ascending to heaven. Even with great fortune, it would take years of toil. The Flowing Cloud Banquet was their clearest and most straightforward path to acquiring such energies. Unfortunately, their own strength was lacking, forcing them to pin their hopes on Gu Yuan.

"Hmph! A mere common-born disciple should count himself lucky to obtain even one strand of spiritual energy. How dare he dream of securing more in the secret realm?" sneered a noble disciple.

"Exactly! To obtain spiritual energy, one must have both the strength and the backing. Does he think he can overturn the heavens alone?" another noble chimed in, laughing mockingly.

With Elder Huo absent after the secret realm competition began, the noble disciples no longer restrained their arrogance and openly ridiculed the common-born. The hall fell silent, the faces of the common-born disciples darkening. They were no fools—the nobles' words hinted at a conspiracy within the secret realm. If true, Senior Brother Gu might be in grave danger.

Among the crowd, Ma Wu's expression also darkened.

*Clang!*

Just then, the golden bell and jade chime in the hall rang out once more, and Elder Huo reappeared at the front of the hall. His face was calm, though a trace of surprise lingered in his eyes, as if he had witnessed something unexpected.

At the sight of Elder Huo, all the disciples fell silent. The noble disciples, however, brightened, as if they could already see their clan brothers emerging triumphantly. The secret realm competition must have concluded.

*Buzz—*

With a wave of his sleeve, Elder Huo caused the screen-like jade wall at the front of the hall to ripple like water. A clear light shimmered, and several figures emerged gracefully from the secret realm, returning to the hall.

At the forefront was a tall, handsome man in a cyan daoist robe. His sleeves swayed with an ethereal grace, as if he were an immortal descended to the mortal world. Behind him stood three others, each with striking appearances and extraordinary temperaments, yet they followed him without the slightest hint of dissatisfaction, as though it were only natural.

The hall erupted into chaos.

"Gu Yuan?! How is he at the forefront?"

"Bian Chuyao, Feng Anping—even Senior Brother Ji Mobai is behind him! How can a common-born disciple deserve such a position?"

"Where is my elder brother, Su Huazheng?"

"Where is Senior Brother Xiao?"

The noble disciples were dumbfounded. After waiting in vain for their clan brothers and seniors to appear, they grew frantic, shouting questions.

"Silence!" Elder Huo's voice boomed, his formidable mana suppressing all noise. 

"The Dao is won through competition. If your skills are lacking, you have no right to complain!" His stern gaze swept across the hall as he reprimanded them.

With another wave of his sleeve, six drenched and disheveled figures were dragged out of the secret realm and deposited at the front of the hall. Their faces were pale, their bodies trembling from the cold. Now, humiliated under the gaze of the crowd, their faces flushed crimson with shame.

"The Flowing Cloud Banquet's ten strands of spiritual energy remain unchanged. In the secret realm competition, Gu Yuan obtained eight strands, securing first place. Bian Chuyao, Feng Anping, and Ji Mobai each obtained four strands, placing second. The remaining six obtained nothing," Elder Huo declared bluntly, sparing no face for the losers.

"How is this possible?!"

"How could our Verdant Flame Peak not obtain a single strand?"

"Elder Brother, say something! How could you lose to a common-born disciple?"

"Senior Sister!"

The hall erupted again, the disciples unable to contain their emotions. The stakes were too high—Foundation Establishment was the key to three hundred years of life. Their hopes had been pinned on their own, and their disappointment was unbearable.

"Silence!" Elder Huo's cold voice cut through the uproar. 

"The strong prevail, the weak submit—such is the Dao! Do you think the heavens decree that birthright alone grants you everything?" 

"The world is ever-changing. Only through struggle can one rise. Now, disperse and cultivate!" With a final admonishment, he used his power to expel all ten disciples except Gu Yuan from the hall, banishing them from Ancient Peak Mountain.

Then, with a flick of his finger, six streaks of light descended, extracting the sword energy Gu Yuan had left in the six defeated disciples and healing their broken limbs. Their complexions returned to normal, and they stood once more in the hall, bowing in gratitude—though their eyes involuntarily flicked toward Gu Yuan.

"The secret realm competition is over. The ten strands of spiritual energy are the academy's investment, meant to nurture talents who will contribute to our institution. You are all elite seeds carefully selected by the academy. Do not dwell on temporary defeats. Once you establish your foundations, there will be ample time ahead..."

Elder Huo shook his head slightly, offering words of consolation.

"Thank you, Elder!" the six disciples chorused, their spirits somewhat lifted.

"Enough talk. The Flowing Cloud Banquet has concluded, and you have all reached the peak of Qi Refinement. These ten Primordial Yang True Jades are the academy's reward. Their spiritual energy is abundant, sufficient for your Foundation Establishment. I hope that the next time we meet, we shall address each other as peers."

With a sweep of his sleeve, Elder Huo distributed ten crimson jades to the disciples. Gu Yuan's, however, shone noticeably brighter than the rest. Then, with another gesture, he enveloped the ten in a peculiar radiance, teleporting them far beyond Ancient Peak Mountain, away from the prying eyes of the waiting crowd.

Just as Gu Yuan was about to leave, a gentle voice whispered in his ear:

"After your Foundation Establishment, come to Ancient Peak Mountain to find me."

The voice belonged to Elder Huo. Though surprised, Gu Yuan betrayed no emotion.

Outside Ancient Peak Mountain, the ten disciples exchanged glances. The six defeated ones departed without a word, leaving only Gu Yuan, Bian Chuyao, Feng Anping, and Ji Mobai.

"Senior Brother Gu, may we meet again with you even more radiant and ageless," Bian Chuyao said softly, bowing before riding her light away. 

Foundation Establishment did not grant immortality, but it did preserve one's youthful appearance until the end of one's lifespan.

"Ahead of time, I congratulate Senior Brother Gu on his successful Foundation Establishment," Feng Anping said with a smile before leaving.

"Senior Brother Gu, until we meet again after Foundation Establishment," Ji Mobai added, giving Gu Yuan a deep look before vanishing on his own light.

In an instant, the world seemed vast and empty, leaving Gu Yuan alone.

He glanced at the clamoring Qi Refinement cultivators gathered outside Ancient Peak Mountain, chuckled softly, and turned away, returning to his Qian Yuan Cave.

All preparations were complete. It was finally time to establish his foundation.
