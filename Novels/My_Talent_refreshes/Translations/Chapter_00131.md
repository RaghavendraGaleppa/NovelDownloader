# Chapter 131: Showing Their Cards, The Battle for the Spirit Seed

After the丹炉 (alchemy furnace) exploded, a red-robed figure appeared.

Elder Gui, his face pale, emerged in mid-air. The next moment, without a word, he suddenly transformed into a crimson streak of escape light and fled in a direction completely different from the others. With his Vital Artifact destroyed, his cultivation was damaged and his vitality severely depleted. To participate in the current fight would only lead to the destruction of his cultivation and the perishing of his body.

The Golden Core cultivators of the Demonic Sect did not pursue the red-robed Elder Gui. Instead, they chased after Elder Yang in green robes and Elder Mu, the silver-haired old woman, who were ahead.

"Xie Chang!"

Black-faced Elder Zhu shouted, gnashing his teeth.

Called by his name by Black-faced Elder Zhu, the plump Elder Xie showed no anger, but the usual smile had vanished from his face. He sighed lightly, then said to Black-faced Elder Zhu, "Old Zhu, you should leave too. The Demonic Sect's target is the Spirit Seed. If you don't interfere, you are free to depart."

"Why?" Elder Zhu roared.

"Heh heh, enough with the nonsense." The gaunt old man in black from the Demonic Sect interjected.

"Go help upfront, I'll handle this here."

Upon hearing this, the plump Elder Xie ignored him and flew towards the front on his own. Black-faced Elder Zhu's expression changed slightly, and he too pursued. However, after chasing only twenty li, he was intercepted by the gaunt old man in black.

The original 5-on-5 situation had now become 6-on-3. Although Elder Yang in green robes, Elder Mu the silver-haired old woman, and Black-faced Elder Zhu used their trump cards, they could only tie down three people. The other two Demonic Sect Golden Core cultivators, along with the plump Elder Xie, headed directly towards the Azure Stream Sect.

A few hundred li was merely a moment's effort for Golden Core cultivators. When the three arrived, they saw Xin Wuya's hand, materialized from spiritual power, still grasping the Wood Spirit Seed, but not yet having full control of it. A look of joy immediately appeared on their faces.

Xin Wuya, upon seeing the three arrive, had a flicker of chilling intent in his refined eyes. His gaze swept over the three, finally resting on the plump Elder Xie Chang.

"Senior Brother Xie, my late master saw you as a rogue cultivator with considerable talent and strength. He admitted you into the Azure Stream Sect and provided abundant resources to help you achieve the Golden Core Dao. Why then do you repay kindness with enmity and betray the sect?"

Faced with Xin Wuya's questioning, a hint of guilt flashed in Xie Chang's eyes, but it quickly returned to normal. "Indeed, the old sect master treated me well back then. He told me more than once that with my talent, it wouldn't be impossible to reach the Nascent Soul stage if I could obtain a fortuitous opportunity. At the time, I just lamented how easily such opportunities could be obtained, but I never expected..."

Xie Chang's eyes held a hint of fervent desire as he spoke. "The Azure Stream Sect actually has a disciple who stumbled into the Spirit Domain, and now there's hope in this lifetime of seeing a Spirit Seed appear. Heh, Sect Master Xin has good foresight. Although it was stated long ago that this Spirit Seed would be yours upon acquisition, and that the five of us would guard the restriction, you had already made arrangements long ago to claim the Spirit Seed for yourself. While many things appeared to be discussed with us, crucial information was kept from me. How could I, Xie Chang, not know of such actions?"

Xie Chang sneered repeatedly. Xin Wuya's refined face, however, remained calm, the chilling intent seemingly having vanished. He merely looked at Xie Chang indifferently, his voice devoid of emotion as he said, "Why you were kept in the dark, Elder Xie, you should know yourself. If not for you, why would there be so many Demonic Sect disciples hidden within the sect?"

"So what?" Xie Chang's face held a mocking expression. "Didn't you, Xin Wuya, already know that this group of entrants included Demonic Sect disciples, yet you still used them to help you activate the array? For this, you didn't care even if some disciples would be attacked and killed by Demonic Sect members after entering the Spirit Domain."

At this, Xie Chang's mockery deepened. "Of course, you wouldn't care. After all, for this Spirit Seed, you haven't hesitated to sacrifice wave after wave of sect disciples. How else would the news leak, and how would the Demonic Sect find me?"

Xin Wuya did not become enraged by Xie Chang's ridicule and mockery; he simply looked at Xie Chang calmly. "Do you truly believe that by helping the Demonic Sect, you can obtain this Spirit Seed? Don't you find it laughable?"

"I never truly intended to obtain this Spirit Seed," Xie Chang chuckled lightly. "But the Demonic Sect's Nascent Soul cultivator promised to share some spiritual essence with me when he comprehends it, and to assist me in forming my Nascent Soul based on his own experience. That is enough."

As he finished speaking, Xie Chang's eyes gleamed with fervor.

Xin Wuya sighed slightly upon hearing this. "Elder Xie, you are playing with fire..."

"Enough, Xin Wuya." It was the bald man, one of the two Demonic Sect Golden Core cultivators, who spoke now. "Stop putting on an act. The Spirit Seed will be claimed by our Demonic Sect, and we can spare your life."

"Want the Spirit Seed? Dream on!" Xin Wuya suddenly scoffed. At the same time, a jade talisman appeared in his hand and shot out. The next moment, a grand array covering the entire inner and outer sections of the Azure Stream Sect lit up.

What greatly surprised the three other Golden Core cultivators was that the illuminated area of this grand array actually encompassed Xin Wuya and the Spirit Seed as well. Not only were the three surprised, but even the other three Azure Stream Sect Golden Core elders, who had been fighting and flying, now had looks of astonishment on their faces.

"The Azure Stream Sect's sect-guarding grand array?" The plump Elder Xie Chang's voice carried a tone of surprise and doubt. The next moment, he couldn't help but let out a cold laugh. "Good, good, Sect Master of Azure Stream Sect, I underestimated you. I didn't expect you to be able to deduce the overlapping location of the Spirit Domain and the real world, and to even secretly expand the sect-guarding grand array to this place. I suppose the other elders weren't even aware, were they?"

Saying this, Xie Chang's gaze swept towards Elder Yang in green robes, Elder Mu the silver-haired old woman, and Black-faced Elder Zhu, who had stopped fighting nearby. Xin Wuya did not answer his words, merely glancing at the three remaining Azure Stream Sect Golden Core elders. The next moment, the three simultaneously transformed into streaks of escape light, shooting towards the sect-guarding grand array.

The Demonic Sect members wanted to stop them, but the three acted suddenly and were already close. In the blink of an eye, the three arrived outside the grand array. At the same time, each of them held a jade talisman in their hands. Holding the jade talismans, the three flew directly into the array without any obstruction.

Seeing this, a smile flashed across Xin Wuya's face, and his calm voice resounded in the air. "Three Elders, all inner sect disciples, resist the enemy with me!"

Within the Azure Stream Sect, when the previous changes occurred, many disciples had already been staring at the sky in confusion. And now, with Xin Wuya's words, the numerous inner sect disciples spread out, taking their places at different points within the grand array. The three Golden Core elders also settled into various positions within the array.

Upon seeing this, the Demonic Sect members and the plump Xie Chang showed no signs of urgency. Xie Chang even sneered, "Xin Wuya, as far as I know, the Azure Stream Sect's sect-guarding grand array requires five Golden Core cultivators to unleash its full potential. Without fully utilizing its power, do you think you can stop the combined efforts of us six to break the array?"

"What if you add me?"

Just as Xie Chang's voice faded, a voice suddenly rang out. Immediately, an old man with completely white hair and beard appeared.

"Tong Wanqing?" Seeing the old man, Xie Chang's face was filled with surprise.

"Elder Tong?" At this moment, within the Azure Stream Sect, many disciples also looked with pleasant surprise at the white-haired, white-bearded old man who slowly emerged. This person was none other than Elder Tong, who had previously appeared in the Hundred Treasures Pavilion with Qi Condensation cultivation.

"Tong Wanqing, I didn't expect you... No, you were injured before, your Golden Core shattered, and your spiritual sense was severely damaged, causing you to fall to the Qi Condensation stage. It's utterly impossible for you to recover." Xie Chang's words were filled with doubt and surprise, then he coldly snorted, "It seems you've merely relied on some secret art or artifact; you're not a true Golden Core cultivator. But even so, with your actual Qi Condensation cultivation, how long can you sustain this?"

"Enough nonsense, break the array!" At this point, the bald Demonic Sect Golden Core cultivator directly interrupted Xie Chang. As soon as he spoke, the six Golden Core cultivators in the air took action. Immediately, various colored lights struck the Azure Stream Sect's sect-guarding grand array.

"Five Elements Breaking Talisman!"

Watching the various lights unleashed by the six Golden Core cultivators, Xin Wuya's expression in the Azure Stream Sect's sect-guarding grand array became solemn. These were truly high-grade superior talismans. He continued to cast spells to maintain the large hand made of spiritual power, attempting to fully control the Wood Spirit Seed. At the same time, he joined the other Golden Core cultivators and the inner sect disciples in activating the array to defend. For a time, even with the Five Elements Breaking Talismans, the six Golden Core cultivators could not affect the sect-guarding grand array in the slightest.

After about the time it takes to brew a cup of tea, the bald man from the Demonic Sect coldly snorted, directly took out a completely blood-red pill filled with a bloody demonic aura, and threw it into his mouth. It was a Blood Fiend Pill. However, unlike the Blood Fiend Pills carried by the Qi Condensation disciples before, this pill of the bald man was many times more potent, both in color and in its bloody demonic aura. At the same time, a claw-shaped artifact appeared in his hand.

"Don't hold anything back! While Xin Wuya is trying to control the Wood Spirit Seed and can't use the sect-guarding grand array to counterattack, let's finish this quickly. If that fellow controls and incorporates the Wood Spirit Seed, we won't be able to bear the responsibility."

As the bald man spoke, the other Golden Core cultivators also took out their Blood Fiend Pills and consumed them. And they all activated an artifact. Even Xie Chang did the same. Instantly, blood fiend energy surged around the six Golden Core experts, and their cultivation aura continuously rose. After the six were completely enveloped by the blood fiend energy, they resembled six blood demons, suspended in mid-air.

At the same time, the six artifacts were activated simultaneously. Streaks of red and black light, mixed with blood fiend energy, shot out from their respective artifacts, striking the sect-guarding grand array.

"Demonic Slash! These people are actually willing to sacrifice their artifacts to unleash the Demonic Slash!" Black-faced Elder Zhu's expression changed slightly. And just as he spoke, several streaks of red and black light successively struck the sect-guarding grand array. Immediately, the entire grand array trembled lightly, appearing on the verge of collapse.

Seeing this, the faces of the Azure Stream Sect disciples within immediately changed drastically, and many Qi Condensation disciples even began to panic. Xin Wuya's expression sank. He formed hand seals, and several beams of light shot into the jade tablet before him. Instantly, the grand array's trembling lessened considerably, and then slowly stabilized again. But at the same time, his giant hand, formed by spiritual power, seemed to fade slightly. The Wood Spirit Seed, which had been grasped within it, now seemed to be on the verge of breaking free. Seeing this, Xin Wuya was greatly alarmed and immediately refocused his attention on the giant hand.

Outside the sect-guarding grand array, the six Golden Core cultivators, seeing this, immediately intensified their attacks. There were no more Demonic Slashes, but the continuous magical attacks, imbued with blood fiend energy, still caused the sect-guarding grand array to tremble unceasingly. It was clear that, under these circumstances, even if the grand array could still hold, it would eventually be breached.

"Sect Master, give me the array-guarding jade tablet."

Just then, Elder Yang in green robes suddenly spoke. Hearing this, the others in the Azure Stream Sect were slightly surprised. Xin Wuya, however, merely glanced at Elder Yang, then threw the jade tablet directly to him without a second thought.

The green-robed elder took the jade tablet, placed it before him, and opened his mouth to spit. Instantly, a round, bluish-white core shot out from his mouth. Simultaneously, streaks of bluish-white light erupted from the core and poured into the jade tablet. But at the same time, the bluish-white core before the green-robed Elder Yang rapidly shrank. As these white lights entered the jade tablet, the sect-guarding grand array, which had begun to dim, suddenly shone brightly. At the same time, the spells that had been striking the sect-guarding grand array now bounced directly back, attacking the six Golden Core cultivators who had cast them.

"Pfft!" The bald man, who bore the brunt of the attack, was struck by the spell and immediately spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. The blood fiend energy around him, however, weakened somewhat. The other Golden Core cultivators also fared poorly. Rebounding from the sect-guarding grand array's backlash, all of them sustained injuries to varying degrees. For a moment, their attacks ceased.

"Good! Good! To risk destroying your Golden Core just to protect this grand array, Brother Yang truly has great courage," Xie Chang said, his voice complex, as he looked at the green-robed elder. "To nourish the grand array with the power of his Golden Core and launch a counterattack – once started, it cannot be stopped, and could even lead to the core's destruction and the extinguishing of his path. What virtue or ability does Xin Wuya have to make Brother Yang protect him like this?"

The round core before the green-robed elder, originally the size of a goose egg, was now only the size of a fingertip and still shrinking. It looked as if it would soon vanish into nothingness. The green-robed elder's aura also continuously weakened. His once black hair had turned as white as Elder Tong's. The wrinkles on his face deepened, and his entire body visibly aged at a rapid pace. Yet, at this moment, he raised his head, his eyes as still as an ancient well.

"Because he is the Sect Master of my Azure Stream Sect."

As Elder Yang in green robes spoke these words, everyone within the Azure Stream Sect was deeply moved.

"Elder Yang!" The next moment, Black-faced Elder Zhu exclaimed, then his figure flashed, appearing before the green-robed Elder Yang. The white core before the latter had now completely dissipated. And this Golden Core elder, who had been taciturn but full of vigor, now resembled a flickering candle in the wind. He could not even remain seated cross-legged in mid-air, instead, he began to fall. Fortunately, Black-faced Elder Zhu appeared in time to support him.

From a distance, Tong Wanqing, seeing this scene, seemed to be deeply affected, letting out a faint sigh. His appearance at this moment was also much older than before. He no longer possessed the immortal-like appearance with crane hair and a youthful face.

"Hahahaha!" At this moment, outside the sect-guarding grand array, the injured bald man burst into maniacal laughter. "Xin Wuya, it seems that for this Spirit Seed, not only do you not hesitate to sacrifice ordinary sect disciples, but you're even willing to sacrifice a Golden Core elder. However, do you truly think this will protect it?"

Following this maniacal laughter, the blood fiend energy around the bald man instantly dissipated. At the same time, a stream of black energy emanated from his body. The maniacal laughter changed tone at this moment, becoming incredibly hoarse and aged. "Xin Wuya, do you really think such a broken array can stop this old man?"

An ancient, hoarse voice resonated in the air. The next moment, within the Azure Stream Sect, the expressions of the several Golden Core cultivators all changed drastically.

"The Great Possession Art! Old Demon Yin!" Xin Wuya, who had managed to remain composed until now, finally had an extremely unsightly expression.

"It is I!" The bald man's body continued to emit that hoarse and ancient voice. "Xin Wuya, although I, the sect master, am in seclusion and cannot personally descend, this Great Possession Art is enough to unleash 60 to 70 percent of my strength. You don't actually think your broken array can stop the combined attack of a Nascent Soul cultivator and several Golden Core cultivators, do you?"

Hearing Old Demon Yin's words, Xin Wuya's face was extremely grim. The Sect Master of the Demonic Sect was a genuine Nascent Soul cultivator, and rumors outside had long claimed he had entered the mid-Nascent Soul stage. If that were true, and he could unleash 60 to 70 percent of his strength as he claimed, that was still the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator. With so many Golden Core cultivators assisting, the Azure Stream Sect's sect-guarding grand array, though impressive, would not be able to withstand it.

"Xin Wuya, it seems you truly intend to bury your entire sect with you." Old Demon Yin coldly snorted, raising both hands. Instantly, two streams of black energy emerged in his hands, transforming into two colossal black fists.

Elder Mu, the silver-haired old woman, seeing this, anxiously looked at Xin Wuya. "Sect Master!"

Xin Wuya glanced at the Wood Spirit Seed in his spiritual power-materialized giant hand, a hint of unwillingness flashing in his eyes, but he finally sighed lightly. "Old Demon Yin, you win. I don't want this Wood Spirit Seed anymore."

"Good, you're sensible." Old Demon Yin let out a hooting laugh like an owl. "Now, quickly release the Wood Spirit Seed and give it to this old man."

Even with Xin Wuya's good composure, his face twitched slightly. After a long moment, just as Old Demon Yin was growing impatient and about to speak again, Xin Wuya's giant hand materialized from spiritual power directly dissolved into specks of white light in the air, all flying back towards him. At the same time, he extended his hand, and the jade tablet that had been with Elder Yang in green robes returned to his grasp.

The next moment, a gap opened in the protective restriction in the air. The green light cluster, which had been trapped, immediately shot towards the sky, then instantly flew out through that gap.

"The Wood Spirit Seed!" Seeing this cluster of green light, even Old Demon Yin, possessing the bald man, showed a look of joy on his face. The two black fists he had materialized now transformed into a single giant black palm, which directly reached out to grasp the green light cluster.

But at this very moment, a white light palm of almost the same size also appeared in the air. It actually moved a step faster and grabbed at the green light cluster first.

"How dare you!" Seeing this, Old Demon Yin let out a great roar. The black giant palm suddenly accelerated.

"Bang!" With a huge thud, the two giant palms collided heavily. Instantly, a powerful spiritual pressure spread out in all directions. Seeing this, Xin Wuya's expression changed drastically. He swiftly activated the sect-guarding grand array, fully opening its defenses. And outside, Xie Chang and the other Golden Core cultivators also quickly fled. Even they had to be quite wary of the aftermath of a Nascent Soul cultivator's battle.

In the sky at this moment, after the two giant hands collided, neither managed to grasp the green light cluster. The light cluster immediately transformed into a streak of light, vanishing in the blink of an eye. The white giant hand, seeing that the Wood Spirit Seed had escaped, also vanished instantly.

Seeing this, Old Demon Yin was furious and shouted, "Who is hiding there, sneaking around, looking for death!!"

His roar echoed throughout the air, but there was no response. Old Demon Yin's black hand then grabbed in the direction from which the white giant hand had come, but he found nothing. It was as if the white giant hand had never appeared.
