# Chapter 79: Power Surpassing True Divinity, Spirit as Ancient as Heaven and Earth! Holding the Secret of Immortality, Seizing the Path to Eternal Life!

The next morning, at dawn.

The Yunxiao Heavenly Ship ascended from Shuangjiu City.

Last night, the leader of the Ancient Moon Peak had returned severely wounded, bringing back the missing inner disciple Li Zhengjing and an old man in black robes whose face was obscured.

All three helmsmen of the Golden Ship of Salvation had perished in Fengdu Mountain!

The leader of the Ancient Moon Peak had fought one against three and slain all his foes!

The news spread from Shuangjiu City to various factions, shocking the world!

Li Zhengjing remained silent. When they left Fengdu Mountain, they had seen that part of the mountain had collapsed—the Great Deity of Fengdu had been crippled!

The leader of the Ancient Moon Peak's achievements were even more terrifying than the world knew.

"Fighting one against three, severely wounding the Ninth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation, and killing the other two helmsmen—after such a battle, he still faced the Great Deity of Fengdu and emerged victorious!" Li Zhengjing couldn't help but marvel inwardly. "The Ancient Moon Peak Master's strength surpasses even that of Xuji Zhenren! No wonder the golden page showed we'd lose even in a two-against-one fight yesterday!"

Lost in thought, he stood on the deck, looking down.

The "stone dragon" of Shuangjiu City grew smaller, while the thick smoke from burning corpses rose into the sky.

Those corpses belonged to the culprits who had released the sinister energy in Shuangjiu City!

Upon their return last night, the Ancient Moon Peak Master, furious, had thoroughly investigated Shuangjiu City. Following the clues, he had uncovered thirteen "ghosts" of the Golden Ship of Salvation within the ranks of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect!

Other factions had also found traces of infiltration and purged their own ranks.

But some things could never be fully cleansed. After all, those who had released the sinister energy to prevent Shuangjiu City from aiding the Ancient Moon Peak Master might not all have been from the Golden Ship of Salvation—some were likely schemers from other factions seeking to kill with borrowed blades, making a complete investigation impossible.

"The people in Shuangjiu City are mere ants, unworthy of excessive attention."

A voice came from above.

Li Zhengjing looked up and saw the Ancient Moon Peak Master standing on the fifth level.

"Come up!"

Li Zhengjing ascended to the fifth level and found Ghost Valley Lingguan already seated nearby, waving a claw at him.

The Ancient Moon Peak Master waved his hand, sealing the area, and said calmly, "After returning to the sect, the Yunxiao Heavenly Ship will dock at the forbidden area of the rear mountain. The elders and disciples assigned to maintain and clean it will not be allowed to leave for ten days to half a month, ensuring your presence remains hidden."

He paused, then added, "As for you... you never left the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Understood?"

Li Zhengjing nodded slightly. The Ancient Moon Peak Master extended his hand.

"The Soul-Searing Whip!"

"Here."

Li Zhengjing took out a bundle containing three items. The most precious, the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure, had already fused with his body. The remaining two were a letter and a short whip.

"My official mission was to slay the helmsmen of the Golden Ship of Salvation and retrieve Ghost Valley Lingguan. But my true goal was to obtain this Soul-Searing Whip."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master said indifferently, "Had you failed to retrieve the whip and ruined my plan to kill the Debt Collector, I would have slain you both in Fengdu Mountain yesterday!"

Li Zhengjing remained expressionless. Had the golden page not shown he stood no chance, he would have drawn his blade against the Ancient Moon Peak Master!

Only Ghost Valley Lingguan seemed pensive upon hearing this. "The Soul-Searing Whip can counter the Debt Collector?"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master did not answer. Instead, he opened the letter left behind by the first Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhou Dynasty.

*Power surpassing true divinity!  
Spirit as ancient as heaven and earth!  
Holding the secret of immortality!  
Seizing the path to eternal life!*

"These four lines... refer to the Debt Collector?" Li Zhengjing murmured. "'Power surpassing true divinity'—so he truly possesses such formidable strength..."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master remained calm, as if he had expected this. Gazing at the Soul-Searing Whip, he said coolly, "'Spirit as ancient as heaven and earth' means his soul is immortal. I already knew that."

Li Zhengjing looked at the whip in his hand. "You went to the underworld to obtain a weapon that can harm souls?"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master replied calmly, "Only this can destroy his soul. The first Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhou Dynasty clearly knew this and left the whip for future generations."

"'Holding the secret of immortality! Seizing the path to eternal life!'" The Hanging-Wall Bird peeked at the letter. "Does this mean the path to immortality isn't severed, that ascension is possible, but the secret is held by the Debt Collector? Cultivators cannot achieve immortality because he has stolen the path?"

At this moment, Yuan Zhengfeng's voice spoke again.

"'Power surpassing true divinity!' From his ability to breach the Stone Bridge and come and go freely under the threat of the Netherworld's Dark Marshal, Xuancha Ghost King, it's clear his power surpasses any other in this world!"

Yuan Zhengfeng continued slowly, "He surpasses even the Celestial Azure Daoist of old! Even with the Soul-Searing Whip, if we can't strike him, it's useless!"

Li Zhengjing remained calm and looked at the Ancient Moon Peak Master. "Elder, what is your plan?"

"If the Debt Collector were at his peak, he would be invincible, surpassing all in this world!"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master said coolly, "But times have changed!"

He stroked the whip and added, "His soul may be immortal, but his body has aged. That's why he needs a new vessel. He's grown old and weak. After returning from the capital, he's even weaker..."

"Perhaps his injuries from breaching the underworld never healed, or perhaps there's another reason. But he is indeed frail now."

"Because of his frailty, seventeen years ago, the previous sect master found him and nearly perished with him."

"Though he escaped Fengdu Mountain, his wounds remain unhealed."

"I've been searching for his weakness. His return from the capital revealed it!"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master looked at Li Zhengjing, his gaze lingering on the jade fragment, then at Ghost Valley Lingguan. "Today marks the Debt Collector's weakest state in millennia—yet he's still stronger than me!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan said slowly, "Though he's at his weakest, he remains stronger than you. That's why you seek our alliance?"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master remained composed. "I am over 380 years old, standing at the pinnacle of this world, just half a step from ascension. I've always been proud—but not blindly so. That demon has lived for at least 4,000 years. Without thorough preparation, we cannot end him in one strike, and the consequences would be dire!"

"Four thousand years?" Li Zhengjing fell silent, his expression shifting.

The Hanging-Wall Bird was stunned, lifting a wing to touch the green dragon horns on its head. "I'm eight. He's four thousand. That's... five hundred times my age? His knowledge must be fathomless!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan's eyes gleamed. "The Golden Ship of Salvation once speculated that the Debt Collector might be an ancient lineage, passed down through generations—like their own 'Heavenly Lord of Ten Thousand Calamities,' now in its third incarnation."

He looked at the Ancient Moon Peak Master. "But you seem certain the Debt Collector isn't a title passed down—you believe it's the same being, alive for four millennia?"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master nodded. "Not only is his soul immortal, his body is indestructible. After four thousand years, only in the last century has he begun to show signs of aging..."

Yuan Zhengfeng asked, "What happened a hundred years ago?"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master shook his head. "The reason is unclear and irrelevant. What matters is this—he began aging a century ago."

"Twenty years ago, he breached the underworld and was severely wounded."

"Seventeen years ago, he fought the previous sect master, worsening his injuries."

"Today, his wounds remain unhealed."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master gripped the whip. "Since his first appearance 3,800 years ago, this is his weakest state!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan spoke again. "Records in the Golden Ship of Salvation mention that 3,800 years ago, the third leader of the Kunlun Immortal Sect, the Celestial Azure Daoist, obtained a great opportunity—was that the Debt Collector's first scheme?"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master replied, "When you believe fortune has blessed you with a rare opportunity, you rejoice, unaware that everything is under his control. You're merely a pawn nurturing his scheme."

Yuan Zhengfeng fell silent, recalling how he had once believed he'd obtained a supreme technique, cultivating diligently in hopes of ascending. Only later did he realize his "opportunity" was part of the Debt Collector's plan—all his efforts had merely shaped him into a vessel.

"This is like being too poor to raise a child, so you give it to others to raise. Once they've poured their heart and soul into raising it, you snatch it back!" The Hanging-Wall Bird fumed. "Utterly despicable!"

"Don't take it personally, Bird Lord. We're talking about the Debt Collector's schemes, not your hatchlings," the Five Elements Creation Tree consoled.

"Scram!" the bird snapped.

Li Zhengjing quietly stuffed both into the phoenix wood box.

The Ancient Moon Peak Master continued, "Even a figure like the Celestial Azure Daoist fell to his schemes. This proves that 3,800 years ago, the Debt Collector was already at the pinnacle of power. Though the Daoist later ascended, he couldn't resolve the threat in time—perhaps even at his peak, he couldn't defeat the Debt Collector."

Ghost Valley Lingguan mused, "Before ascending, the Celestial Azure Daoist left the Nine Calamities Inherited Thunderflame to the Kunlun Immortal Sect, making it the foremost of the three great sects. It seems this treasure was meant to counter the Debt Collector."

Yuan Zhengfeng added quietly, "After Kunlun, other factions—the Luofu Immortal Sect, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, the Diamond Temple, even the founding emperor of the Great Zhou—all received 'great opportunities.'"

Li Zhengjing looked at the letter. "And the first Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhou—three generations of his family."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master took a deep breath. "He sows opportunities across the world, nurturing them until they mature—then he reaps the harvest."

His voice turned icy. "His first harvest was 2,600 years ago. The ancient Great Xuan Dynasty collapsed, its royal lineage exterminated. The world descended into chaos for over a millennium until the Great Zhou's founding emperor restored order."

"Because of this, all factions now fear him and seek to hunt him down."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master's tone grew grave. "For the sake of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect and the secret of immortality, I will slay him!"

He looked at Li Zhengjing, his gaze settling on the jade fragment. "Both of you are targets of the Debt Collector. Surely you yearn to see him destroyed?"

Li Zhengjing didn't respond. Yuan Zhengfeng remained silent.

The Ancient Moon Peak Master turned to Ghost Valley Lingguan. "This matter doesn't concern you directly, but you know too much..."

"Just a Dao Oath, I understand." Ghost Valley Lingguan spread his claws, then narrowed his eyes. "But I wonder—the Debt Collector is ancient and cunning. Are you truly confident you can kill him? Or have you gathered a coalition of indebted faction leaders?"

The Ancient Moon Peak Master shook his head. "The Golden Ship of Salvation is only 1,300 years old, yet its 'ghosts' infest the world. Who can say who is friend or foe?"

He looked at Ghost Valley Lingguan. "After four millennia, how many pawns has the Debt Collector planted? I trust very few."

Ghost Valley Lingguan pondered, then said, "I might be willing to help. But... I'm curious about his secret to longevity. If you're truly certain..."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master said coolly, "The secret of immortality cannot be shared lightly. But his four-thousand-year-old body is yours."

Ghost Valley Lingguan brightened. "Agreed. A Dao Oath seals it."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master produced Dao Oath contracts, distributing them to all present—even the Hanging-Wall Bird, the Five Elements Creation Tree, and the young Gu insect.

"All matters regarding the Debt Collector must remain secret," the Ancient Moon Peak Master declared. "Including the underworld. Until he is dead, none shall speak of it."

All agreed and swore the oath. The Ancient Moon Peak Master gave his contract to Ghost Valley Lingguan, while the others handed theirs to him.

"Break this oath, and I will execute you with it."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master stored the contracts and said to Li Zhengjing, "In two days, the Debt Collector will reappear—at his weakest. This chance is rare."

"After this, his wounds may heal. We cannot afford mistakes."

"You are more important than Xin Xuan. Of all his chosen vessels, you are the most prized. Thus, you will be the bait."

He turned and walked away. "After returning to the sect, focus on cultivation. If you receive my token within ten days, descend the mountain—it means the hunt has begun."

Silence fell once more.

In two days, the Debt Collector would appear.

The Ancient Moon Peak Master was prepared.

The descent would come within ten days.

Perhaps... in just two.

"The Ancient Moon Peak Master's injuries seem severe, but his foundation is unharmed. A single Refined Life-Death Pill will heal him," Ghost Valley Lingguan said. "Our problem is greater."

Li Zhengjing sighed. "You've replaced your body and haven't fully adapted, weakening you. As for me, my cultivation is shallow. Even with Elder Yuan's help, I'm only half a Human Immortal."

Ghost Valley Lingguan said, "This is perilous. One misstep, and we perish. I have some means of survival, but you..."

Yuan Zhengfeng interjected, "With the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure, your vitality is strong. Ordinary wounds won't hinder you, and your spiritual energy flows freely. You need not fear straining your foundation as before."

"With this, once you reach the True Qi realm and open your meridians, you'll be akin to a full Human Immortal—better able to protect yourself."

"But breaking through won't happen overnight."

Yuan Zhengfeng's tone was grave.

Ghost Valley Lingguan stepped closer, whispering to Yuan Zhengfeng, "I have a method to accelerate his cultivation using the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi within him. But it's perilous and agonizing. He may refuse."

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice grew heavier. "I've heard of this method. It's indeed dangerous and excruciating. But time is short. With the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure, his life should be safe. Given our circumstances, he must endure."

Ghost Valley Lingguan agreed. "With this method, he'll reach the True Qi realm in half a month. But the suffering will be immense..."

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing, seemingly troubled, rubbed his temples and muttered, "It's been less than two months since I reached the Internal Qi realm."

"Now, in ten days—perhaps just two or three—I must reach the True Qi realm?"

He sighed. "With ten days, it'd be manageable. But two? The odds are slim—only ninety percent... Huh? Where is everyone? Elder Ghost Valley? Elder Yuan? Hanging-Wall? Say something..."
