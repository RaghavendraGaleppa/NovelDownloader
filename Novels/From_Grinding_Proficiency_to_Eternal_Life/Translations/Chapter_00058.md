# Chapter 58: Lichun

As the final system notification surfaced in his mind, Xu Yunfan felt his vision clear up, as if the clouds had parted to reveal the sun.

The information on the attribute panel was ready.

The silk cloth in his hand trembled slightly. The originally obscure and difficult-to-understand characters on it began to writhe like living things. The unique secret language combinations of the Iron Cloak Sect gradually became clear in his eyes, as if an invisible barrier had been quietly lifted.

"So that's how it is..."

He murmured softly, his fingertips gently tracing the complex patterns on the silk cloth.

The essence of the "Iron Bridge Fortress Bone Tempering Chapter" was now laid bare before him. The hidden meanings between the lines surged like a river, piercing straight into his heart. The obscure expressions that had once left him baffled now illuminated his thoughts like bright lamps.

Every mantra seemed to resonate with the blood and energy within his body. Faintly, he could even feel the subtle tremors coming from deep within his bones.

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

"Iron Bridge Fortress, using bone as the foundation, using energy as the guide, transforming hardness into softness, transforming softness into form..."

He silently recited the general principles on the silk cloth. He felt the blood and energy throughout his body boiling, as if an invisible bridge had been erected within him, connecting his four limbs and hundreds of bones.

It began to gradually seep into his bone marrow.

**[Iron Bridge Fortress Bone Tempering Chapter has been initiated.]**

**[Iron Bridge Fortress 0/500 (Initiated)]**
**Special Effects: Bones as hard as piles, shock bone through strength, hard bone卸力 (dissipating force)]**

The Iron Bridge Fortress Bone Tempering Chapter, once initiated, brought forth three special effects, all focused on tempering the bones. The effect of refining the bones was like a hammer forging steel, penetrating straight to the marrow.

*Creak, creak...*

The sound of his bones tightening like bowstrings filled his ears.

With just a slight flex of his fingers, a series of *crackling* sounds erupted from his joints, resembling the sudden cracking of ice on a frozen lake in the dead of winter.

While digesting the cultivation memories that had spontaneously appeared in his mind, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but grimace.

In his memories, every time he practiced the Iron Bridge Fortress Bone Tempering Chapter, he needed to apply a secret medicinal ointment all over his body, then activate his blood and energy to move the medicinal power into his bones.

The stinging pain of the medicinal oil seeping into his muscles like a living creature, the ant-biting numbness and itch deep in his marrow as he moved his blood and energy, the lesson of sharp pain in his ribs if his breathing rhythm was off by half a beat...

The pain he experienced was so vividly remembered, as if he had truly been there, suffering it without any reduction.

There were specific key points regarding the frequency of blood and energy movement, how it flowed, and how to coordinate it with breathing.

He looked at the silk cloth on the table. If it were someone else, without a master to guide them into the door and without the corresponding secret medicinal ointment, it would be impossible to practice this martial art successfully.

Now, his tendons and skin had both achieved great success. His tendons were like twisted silk, his skin like tough leather. Now, his bones had also初步 formed an iron pile, entering the threshold.

He pushed open the window to face the lingering fine snow. The wind of Beiye City, carrying ice particles, swept across his face, but it could no longer stir even a shred of shivering.

When the snow melts next year and spring returns to the earth, he planned to leave Beiye City to find a sect and become a disciple. Staying here was too limiting; he wanted to see what lies beyond the external three harmonies.

Specifically where to go, he needed to discuss with Lü Yi. This old veteran, having traveled north and south for decades, naturally had unique experience.

Before that, perhaps he could go take a look at the Thousand Buddha Temple.

Late at night, he formed the hand seal for the 'Lin' character, recited the 'Supreme Goodness is Like Water' Heart Mantra, and meditated and cultivated over and over again.

Although he hadn't entered its door and hadn't obtained its truth, every time he cultivated, a prompt would jump on his vision indicating an increase in the proficiency of the 'Lin' character technique.

The fact that he hadn't initiated it made him feel a bit uncomfortable.

Every time he visualized the 'Lin' character technique and recited the heart mantra, a vague human figure would naturally begin to form in his mind. However, that layer of grey mist-like stagnation always lingered over his spiritual platform, like looking at a fire through a veil, unable to touch the true meaning.

It was itchy.

On the proficiency panel, the 'Lin' character technique was the only one that hadn't been initiated.

This made him somewhat restless and truly uncomfortable.

Half an hour later, Xu Yunfan was extremely mentally exhausted. Lying on the bed, fatigue like a tide swallowed his consciousness, and he fell into a deep sleep.

In the days that followed, Xu Yunfan's life became extremely regular. In the morning, he practiced the Flying Leg; at noon, he practiced the Cloak Hammer; at night, he tempered his bones with the Iron Bridge Fortress; and late at night, he meditated and cultivated the 'Lin' character technique.

Out of the twelve shichen (24 hours) of the day, he spent nearly seven shichen immersed in cultivation. Apart from eating, drinking, and sleeping, Xu Yunfan was like a ascetic monk, cultivating crazily.

At least, that's how it appeared to the outside world.

But to Xu Yunfan, who had the attribute panel, it was a self-enjoyable pleasure, and he was immersed in it, unable to extricate himself.

The Flying Leg was greatly perfected. He ran like a fierce horse. The frozen sparrows in the corner of the eaves yesterday could no longer catch up to even seventy percent of his speed's afterimage today.

Under the great perfection of the Red Copper Body Cloak Hammer, when he brandished the瓮金锤 (urn gold hammer), the hammer danced as a mass of fierce wind. Inside the courtyard, the strong winds swirled back, and the falling snow was blown back into the air by the gusts before it could even touch the ground.

Occasionally, someone curious about the noise from over the wall would climb up to peek. They would see hammer shadows like a red python writhing and would be so frightened their legs would shake.

This day was already Lichun (the Beginning of Spring).

Lü Yi knocked on the door, carrying a pot of wine.

Xu Yunfan, bare-chested, put down the urn gold hammer in his hand. His whole body was steaming with heat, and mist curled around his arms and body as the moisture inside him evaporated.

He drank a cup of boiled cold water from the table, then went forward and opened the door.

As soon as the door opened, Lü Yi's voice came.

"Wow, what a huge heat."

Old Man Lü fanned the air with his hand and walked into the courtyard sideways.

Xu Yunfan smiled and said, "Why do you have time to come today? Oh, you even brought a pot of wine, that's rare!"

Old Man Lü snorted lightly and placed the wine jar in his hand on the stone table in the corner.

"It's Lichun today. I haven't seen you come out for many days, so I came to take a look."

"Lichun?"

Xu Yunfan was stunned and subconsciously looked aside.

The first drop of water fell from the icicle at the corner of the eaves.

Spring time, the earth returns to life, and all things grow.

Winter is coming to an end.

It's already Lichun.

Xu Yunfan felt a bit dazed. Calculating the days, he had been here for half a year.

He tidied himself up slightly, sat down, and ate and drank with Lü Yi for a while. After putting down the wine cup, Xu Yunfan finally let out a breath.

"Winter has finally passed."

Lü Yi, having been in the streets for a long time, naturally understood what Xu Yunfan meant.

He looked at Xu Yunfan with a slightly surprised expression and said, "Many people can't survive the winter. Now that spring has returned to the earth, we have finally survived the difficult days."

Lü Yi rubbed his wine cup. "There is great chaos in Wuzhou. The rebel forces have gathered like sparks. They have gathered two hundred thousand troops at Changyi in Wuzhou Prefecture, just waiting for the ice and snow to melt to attack Changyi. This matter has caused countless common people to suffer and die.

The common people of Wuzhou who have reached Beiye City are few, but most of them cannot survive. The prominent families in the city provide porridge for relief, and sheds are built outside the city. The prefect of the city, Jiang Huaisheng, is also quite benevolent and has implemented various policies."

At this point, Lü Yi still let out a long sigh.

"Difficult, difficult, too difficult! In the Western part of the city, the mass grave has dug no less than twenty large pits to bury the bodies."
