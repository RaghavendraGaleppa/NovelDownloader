# Chapter 486: Ancestral Master, Save Me!

Although Puchan Pure Land was not particularly fond of these sword maniacs from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, he was currently the incarnate body of Amitabha, enlightened by the World Honored One Tathagata. He believed the other party would surely give him some face.

Just as Xu Yunfan's figure was about to breach the boundary of the massive, invisible "Sword Sect Mountain Protection Array" that enveloped the solitary peak and its surrounding area...

*Ching!*

A clear and resonant sword cry, like a dragon's roar echoing through the nine heavens, erupted suddenly from Xu Yunfan's body!

He did not attack the terrifying phantom behind him.

Instead, while flying at breakneck speed, his right hand suddenly drew the True Martial Sword from the simple and unadorned scabbard at his waist!

The blade left its sheath, its cold light piercing and sharp!

Without any preparation, Xu Yunfan immediately executed his ultimate trump card, the move he was most reluctant to use lightly.

It was not the True Martial Subduing Demon Sword Art, but rather...

The Three Forms of Pure Yang!

This sword art was completely different from the *True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra*, which was filled with a murderous aura soaring to the heavens.

It was simple, pure, and righteous.

The moves consisted of only three techniques: thrust, lift, and劈 (pī - chop/slash). Yet, the concept they contained was vast and supreme, truly the utmost of hardness and yang, pure and orthodox.

This was the foundation of the swordsmanship he had learned from his master, Bi Yuan Dao Ren, in the Dao Sect back when he was in the mundane martial arts world of the Divine Martial Realm.

It was a secret art passed down through the single lineage of his master, Bi Yuan Dao Ren, and was said to be a sword art created by the Ancestral Master Lu Zu of Pure Yang, who shook the four seas a thousand years ago, while he was still in the mortal world.

Though simple, it struck at the very root of Pure Yang.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan seemed to have forgotten his identity as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the terrifying great enemy behind him, and all other distracting thoughts.

All of his strength, all of his will, were condensed onto the sword, merging into the three simple yet Pure Yang true meaning-filled slashes!

The first sword of the Three Forms of Pure Yang, Scorching the Sea.

The sword light flickered like the first rays of the rising sun, vast and magnificent!

The second form, Rending the Firmament.

The sword momentum was like a scorching sun hanging in the sky, sweeping away the gloom and cleansing all evil.

The third form, Subduing the Demon. The sword intent was like an immortal pine tree standing tall and upright against the heavens. The Pure Yang Sword Gang swept through the eight desolations, cleansing all evil, finally revealing the true meaning of annihilation and executing the demon!

As he executed the sword forms, Xu Yunfan let out a cold sneer toward Sanzang.

This was his final trump card. If he had guessed wrong, then everything would naturally be over. He would decisively execute Soul Swap, sever the karma of his main body, and投入 (tóurù - cast/throw into) his clone's consciousness to start over.

If he had guessed right, then the world would be his oyster. He would finally have some room to maneuver regarding his own various matters.

Subsequently, Xu Yunfan poured all the strength in his body into a skyward shout that was loud enough to crack stone and pierce clouds, filled with endless grievance and a sliver of hope amidst life and death.

"Ancestral Master, save me!!!"

"Uh..."

Even though the seated phantom's broad, Buddha-like face was the will of Amitabha descended into a body, and even though its Dao Heart was already clear and unimpeded, witnessing Xu Yunfan's series of actions at this moment, that grand and solemn face was forcibly contorted into a trace of extreme incongruity and extreme eeriness...

A distortion.

A Foundation Establishment cultivator of the demonic path, who bore demonic arts and a murderous aura, and had just shattered his Buddha Golden Body.

In the final moment of being pursued by the highest existence of Buddhism and with his life hanging by a thread.

Instead of using demonic tricks or begging for mercy and surrender.

He ran to the gates of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the leader of the Dao Sect, and performed a set of...

Utterly orthodox, Dao true meaning-filled... mundane sword techniques?!

And he even shouted with all his might, "Ancestral Master, save me"?!

Preposterous!

Ridiculous!

The greatest joke under the heavens!

This was truly the number one joke since the creation of the Taihua Lingxu World.

The instantaneous emotional impact almost made this supreme existence unable to maintain the solemn expression formed by his descended will. The corner of his mouth couldn't help but twitch slightly, and an indescribably absurd feeling surged in his heart.

He felt that the cultivator before him, who was like an ant, was so unorthodox, eccentric, and absurd in his actions that it had surpassed the realm of what reason could comprehend.

What was this?

A mockery before death?

Or the desperation of a critically ill patient trying any doctor?

"Stubbornly unenlightened, seeking your own death!"

The grand, ethereal voice finally carried a hint of anger.

He truly did not want to watch this laughable farce any longer.

Indeed, the cultivators of Puchan Pure Land were known for their faces being thicker than the combined corners of twenty-four city walls; they could still pick flowers and smile even if pointed at by a thousand fingers.

But Xu Yunfan's actions were truly world-shaking and shocking.

A dignified demonic path cultivator actually performed the Pure Yang Sword Art and shouted for his ancestral master's help at the gates of the Dao Sect's leader. This was an unprecedentedly absurd spectacle.

Sanzang suddenly felt ripples appear in the void. Several divine sense fluctuations from various parties pierced through the mountains and clouds, carrying astonishment and ridicule that felt like thorns on his back.

The high-level figures of various sects secretly observing from the shadows were probably sneering in their hearts.

This圣僧 (shèngsēng - holy monk) of Puchan Pure Land was far too ruthless, actually forcing his opponent to the point of deranged behavior and madness.

This made Sanzang's face burn. He planned to capture Xu Yunfan first and deal with him after returning to the Bodhi Pure Land.

In an instant, a colossal, glazed-colored Buddha's palm silently condensed out of thin air from the void. Ignoring distance, it reached directly toward Xu Yunfan, who had just breached the boundary of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's Mountain Protection Array and whose figure seemed incredibly tiny against the backdrop of the massive sword peak. The palm reached out gently, yet with an irresistible force.

The level of power contained in this Buddha's palm completely surpassed that of the previous Golden Body. Xu Yunfan absolutely could not resist it.

Sanzang had already pushed the power of the Amitabha incarnate body to its absolute limit. Even a True Lord would have to take notice, let alone the fact that he had not broken any rules, still operating at the power level of a Foundation Establishment Great cultivator.

It was just that his status had slightly exceeded the limit.

Given the face of the World Honored One Tathagata, this was not a big deal.

Xu Yunfan's hair stood on end, and the shadow of death enveloped him instantly.

But he could not care about that anymore.

The Three Forms of Pure Yang had already been executed, and the shout for the ancestral master's help had also been made.

He even closed his eyes, letting the glazed Buddha's palm fall.

He was just waiting for it to land, at which moment he would sever the karma and self-detonate his main body.

Sanzang's phantom's expression returned to calm, carrying a hint of "after all, it has come to an end" indifference, preparing to capture and take him away.

However, just as the glazed Buddha's palm was about to touch Xu Yunfan's back heart...

Another change occurred!

BOOM!!!

The entire world seemed to suddenly fall silent.

A light.

A strand of sword qi.

A brilliance that could not be described in words for its splendor, its purity, and its might.

Without any warning, it erupted from the peak of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's main peak, which stood straight like a sword and pierced into the clouds.

From the summit, amidst the churning sea of clouds and the fierce, primordial winds, as if it had stood there for eternity.

It did not shoot out.

It exploded out of thin air.

Like the first ray of dawn light at the birth of the universe.

In an instant, it scattered all the clouds covering the peak, causing the sky for hundreds of miles around to suddenly brighten.

The dazzling brilliance of this light was enough to eclipse the sun hanging high in the sky.

Sword light.

Pure, ultimate, supreme sword intent.

It was not a blinding, harsh white, but rather contained an indescribable quality, as if it were the ultimate form condensed and sublimated from all the concepts of "sword" in the world.

It was brilliance, it was coldness, it was destruction, it was protection, it was the resolve to sever all bonds.
