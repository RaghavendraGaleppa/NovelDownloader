# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 127: Sea of Clouds  

Lin Xuan's actions might seem puzzling to some. After all, the *Thunderbolt Scripture* was merely an ordinary cultivation technique from the fourth-rate Thunder Sword Sect—its power limited and of no use to someone like him, who already possessed the *Nine Heavens Profound Technique*.  

Yet, Lin Xuan had his own reasons.  

Though the Thunder Sword Sect had indeed declined, their ancestors had deliberately recorded the *Thunderbolt Scripture* in a book embedded with Mother Profound Iron. There had to be a purpose behind it.  

If it were truly worthless, why use such precious materials? A simple jade slip would have sufficed.  

Mother Profound Iron was something Lin Xuan absolutely had to obtain, which meant the scripture would inevitably be damaged in the process. Thus, he first made a copy of the *Thunderbolt Scripture* to study later.  

By the time he finished, night had fallen. Lin Xuan stored everything away and retired to bed. Today had been eventful, and he needed proper rest to recover his energy. Tomorrow, during the Nascent Soul Formation Ceremony, he would have to act according to circumstances.  

---  

Early the next morning, just as Lin Xuan had risen, a message talisman flew into his room—an invitation from the Green Cloud Mountain Sect for guests to gather at the ceremony venue.  

The Sea of Clouds was the largest plaza in Green Cloud Mountain, so vast that its edges were invisible to the eye. True to its name, wisps of white clouds drifted beneath one's feet, creating an ethereal atmosphere akin to the legendary Penglai Immortal Realm.  

This was where the Nascent Soul Formation Ceremony would take place.  

Amidst the misty immortal aura, beams of multicolored light streaked across the sky as they arrived, keeping the Green Cloud Mountain disciples busy with reception duties.  

From the Four Seas and Immortal Mountains, sects large and small, cultivation clans, and even renowned rogue cultivators—never before in a century had the Youzhou cultivation world witnessed such a grand gathering.  

Compared to the mortal world, the cultivation realm was far more hierarchical. With so many attendees today, their seating arrangements clearly reflected their status.  

Setting aside the host, Green Cloud Mountain, the two most prestigious seats belonged to its two rival powerhouses:  

The First Ridge and the Thundercloud Manor. Though the three sects schemed against one another, surface harmony had to be maintained. Moreover, given their formidable strength, any slight would be a grave discourtesy.  

Unlike the jubilant atmosphere among Green Cloud Mountain disciples, the faces of the other two sects' members were dark and cold. The rise of a rival Nascent Soul cultivator was a heavy blow to their prestige.  

Whether intentional or not, the delegations from these two sects were conspicuously formidable—each led by their respective sect leaders. The First Ridge's leader was an elderly man with white hair and beard, his cultivation level and age impossible to discern.  

From the murmurs around him, Lin Xuan learned that this elder was a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.  

As for the Thundercloud Manor's lord, he was a robust and heroic-looking man, also at the late-stage Golden Core realm.  

Aside from their leaders, the two sects had brought over a dozen Golden Core cultivators, with the rest at least at the Foundation Establishment stage (fourth layer or higher). Not a single low-level Qi Condensation disciple was present.  

Their demeanor seemed less like a congratulatory visit and more like a provocation. Though the three sects exchanged polite words, the undercurrents of tension were unmistakable.  

Lin Xuan observed briefly before shifting his gaze. Matters unrelated to him were not worth pondering.  

Aside from the two powerhouses, the prime eastern seating was reserved for second-tier sects like the Heavenly Mountain Sect, Thunderhawk Sect, and Five Colors Sect—groups without Nascent Soul cultivators but boasting numerous Golden Core experts.  

Third-rate sects, cultivation clans, and rogue cultivators were seated in descending order.  

By the time Lin Xuan arrived at the Sea of Clouds, the plaza was already packed, with most guests present.  

After presenting his invitation, the attending disciple respectfully guided him to the eastern section—the best seating after the three powerhouses, placed alongside elite sects like the Heavenly Mountain Sect. This wasn't due to any knowledge of the Spirit Medicine Mountain's hidden strength but out of respect for their alchemical expertise.  

"Junior Brother Lin, we meet again."  

"Brother Xu."  

Lin Xuan cupped his hands toward the Heavenly Mountain Sect's seating. Xu Feng returned the gesture, while his younger sister, Xu Yin, pouted and ignored him, clearly still sulking over yesterday's incident.  

Lin Xuan merely smiled, unbothered by a young girl's temper.  

*The plaza is crowded, and Green Cloud Mountain seems short-handed. I wonder how things are at the herb garden?*  

As he sipped fine wine, Lin Xuan pondered. While the Nascent Soul Formation Ceremony was intriguing, it was merely a chance to broaden his horizons. His true priority was stealing the immortal herb—but that required patience and opportunity.  

Among cultivators of his level, Lin Xuan was considered exceptionally knowledgeable—but only regarding pills, materials, and demonic beasts. His understanding of Youzhou's major powers and their top experts remained superficial.  

Xu Feng, however, was a rising star of the Heavenly Mountain Sect and a strong contender for future leadership. Aside from his profound cultivation, he was well-versed in worldly affairs.  

Once Lin Xuan realized this during their conversation, he naturally sought his insights.  

As the two chatted, Lin Xuan suddenly stiffened and looked up—as did nearly every other cultivator present—toward the plaza's entrance.  

A dark cloud drifted in, reeking of a nauseating stench. Lin Xuan frowned and held his breath, unsure if the fumes were toxic.  

"What is that?"  

"Disgusting!"  

"Not good—that's the Extreme Demon Qi!"  

Amidst the exclamations, chaos erupted. The Green Cloud Mountain Sect leader's expression darkened as he gestured, sending two Foundation Establishment disciples to intercept the black cloud.  

"Who dares trespass upon Green Cloud Mountain?"  

Lin Xuan's attention sharpened. The aura of that black cloud felt familiar—identical to the demonic cultivator who had raided the Treasure Hunt Convention.  

*This is no makeshift market for low-level cultivators but one of Youzhou's three powerhouses, backed by a Nascent Soul expert. To cause trouble here is suicide. What could this demonic cultivator possibly be planning?*
