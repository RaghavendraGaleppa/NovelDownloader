# Chapter 52: Zhengjing Slays the Poison King!

**Boom!**

The sword descended upon the high platform, shattering everything in its wake!  

The Young Master of Kunlun sheathed his sword, watching as the starlight scattered into nothingness. Before him, no trace of the Poison King Xin Xuan remained.  

His expression was icy as he surveyed the remnants and said slowly, "The Star-Shifting Grand Formation—a secret technique of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. It requires seven nights of starlight to complete!"  

His gaze swept over the elders and disciples of the Feather Transformation Sect below before finally settling on Lu Huaiyuan, who was just arriving outside the city walls.  

"In the name of the Kunlun Immortal Sect, I demand an explanation from the Feather Transformation Sect!"  

---  

Meanwhile, three hundred miles south of Siyecheng, deep within a secluded mountain forest—  

Where there had been nothing before, a dazzling brilliance of starlight suddenly descended from the heavens.  

A wild laughter echoed through the wilderness.  

"Vast as the Central Plains may be, with the Great Zhou court, immortal sects, Buddhist temples, and all manner of forces gathered here—what can they do to me?"  

As the voice faded, a towering figure emerged from the starlight, his form solidifying before landing on the ground.  

The mountain breeze brushed past his ears like whispers.  

"Ninety-eight… ninety-nine…"  

Then, a sudden shout—  

"One hundred!"  

Before the sound could fully dissipate, a sea of flames erupted, engulfing the area where the starlight had gathered!  

**"An ambush?!"**  

Poison King Xin Xuan was horrified. With no time to dodge, he frantically summoned hundreds of poison insects from his body, forming a barrier to shield himself.  

Yet, under the flames, the insects fell like rain!  

And within the fire, there was something even more terrifying—a sword intent, sharp and condensed!  

In an instant, the insect barrier was torn apart!  

The flaming sword intent surged forward, undeterred!  

**"Rise!"**  

Xin Xuan hastily summoned another object, only for it to be pierced through by the fiery blade.  

He barely managed to twist his body, but the sword still grazed his waist.  

A large chunk of flesh was torn away, instantly charred by the flames!  

He collapsed to the ground, the scent of roasted meat filling the air. Glancing down, he saw his organs faintly visible beneath the cooked flesh!  

Before he could react, another blade came slashing down at his head!  

**"Go!"**  

Poison King Xin Xuan immediately summoned his Divine King Gu!  

A palm-sized, emerald-green cicada-like insect fluttered into the air!  

The Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Blade struck the Divine King Gu, and a thunderous explosion resounded!  

Yet, the insect's shell was as hard as refined iron, completely unharmed. It immediately spewed a cloud of poisonous mist!  

**"Poison! Retreat!"**  

A young voice rang out.  

A green-horned, golden-feathered bird swiftly took to the sky, retreating at once!  

**"Who are you?!"**  

Only now did Poison King Xin Xuan manage to prop himself up, his face filled with shock.  

He had exhausted all his efforts to escape Siyecheng, only to walk straight into an ambush here.  

The sword intent within the flames bore a striking resemblance to that of the Kunlun Young Master!  

For a moment, he had thought that even after teleporting three hundred miles away, the Kunlun Young Master had still pursued him!  

But now, he realized—  

The sword intent in the flames was not as vast as the Kunlun Young Master's, but its sharpness and refinement surpassed it!  

In terms of sheer edge, it was superior!  

**"The Star-Shifting Formation was supposed to transport me three hundred miles away from Siyecheng, but even Zhou Li couldn't determine the exact direction!"**  

Poison King Xin Xuan's heart pounded.  

**"How did he know to ambush me here?!"**  

Just as he was thinking this, a gentle, amiable voice spoke up.  

**"Master, it really is Poison King Xin Xuan!"**  

The golden-feathered bird in the sky exclaimed in awe, **"You truly are divine! Earlier, you said to count to a hundred and then unleash everything at this empty spot. I thought you'd gone mad… but you actually foresaw this?!"**  

**"Shut up!"**  

The young voice from before snapped.  

The youth stepped forward, gripping his blade tightly as he stared at Poison King Xin Xuan, his expression grave.  

The method of altering fate had instructed him to count to a hundred and then unleash his full power at this very spot.  

He had assumed that since his opponent was not yet an immortal, a single decisive strike would be enough to kill him.  

Yet now, despite following the instructions perfectly, his enemy was only severely wounded—not dead!  

What was he supposed to do now?  

The method of altering fate had ended here, offering no further guidance!  

**"Did the damn author just drop the story here? Am I supposed to figure it out myself? Or am I already invincible?"**  

Li Zhengjing tightened his grip on his blade, the Divine Fire Sword technique in his left arm ready to strike.  

His opponent was, after all, the Poison King of the Southern Wasteland!  

A figure revered like a god across the six southern domains!  

In Siyecheng, despite being surrounded by countless experts—the Kunlun Young Master, the Buddhist disciple of the Diamond Temple, the Feather Transformation Sect's top disciple, the Great Zhou court's commander, and over a thousand others—he had still escaped unscathed!  

Now, in this place, with only himself and a bird, how could he possibly win? Even escaping seemed unlikely!  

But then he glanced at the golden page's fortune-telling and felt slightly reassured.  

**"Poison King Xin Xuan, long time no see."**  

Li Zhengjing raised his blade, gathering momentum as he spoke slowly, **"We met half a year ago, and you nearly killed me. Did you ever imagine that today, you might fall by my hand?"**  

Xin Xuan narrowed his eyes, studying the youth before him. Suddenly, realization dawned, and he gasped, **"You're still alive?!"**  

Since entering the Central Plains, he had taken many lives.  

But during his half-year stay in the capital, he had kept a low profile, rarely appearing in public. Aside from the Crown Prince, only one other person had ever been targeted by his poison—and that memory was vivid.  

**"Thanks to your 'kindness,' I'm still alive."**  

Li Zhengjing smirked before charging forward with his blade, shouting, **"Today, if you'd be so kind as to lend me your head, I might just live even better!"**  

**"Half a year ago, you were just a mortal. Now, after only six months of cultivation, you think you can kill me?"**  

Xin Xuan sneered and flicked his finger.  

His Divine King Gu spread its wings, instantly spawning thousands of larvae that surged toward Li Zhengjing like a tidal wave!  

The golden-feathered bird swooped low, spewing flames in front of Li Zhengjing!  

The countless larvae were roasted alive before they could even take flight, raining down as charred husks!  

But the Divine King Gu broke through the flames, darting straight for Li Zhengjing!  

Li Zhengjing swung his blade, striking the insect head-on!  

Yet, the Divine King Gu's shell remained unscathed!  

**"My Divine King Gu can face a True Qi realm expert head-on. With your meager skills, you think you can harm it?"**  

Before Xin Xuan could finish gloating, Li Zhengjing raised his left arm—  

**Divine Fire Sword!**  

A blade of fire, infused with sword intent, erupted forth!  

The flaming sword shot out, reducing a boulder over ten zhang away to blackened rubble!  

**"Hahaha!"** The golden-feathered bird cackled. **"The Divine Fire Sword destroyed his Divine King Gu! Without his poison, he's as good as dead! Master, let's finish him—Holy shit! Master, watch out!"**  

**"…"**  

Li Zhengjing suddenly felt a sharp pain at the back of his neck!  

He reached back to grab whatever had bitten him—but caught nothing!  

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a tiny insect fluttering away.  

**"Your cultivation is too weak, your movements too slow."**  

Xin Xuan caught the Divine King Gu in his palm and placed it against the gaping wound on his waist. The insect released its toxins, sealing the injury.  

He smirked at Li Zhengjing. **"A mere Inner Qi realm, yet possessing such a formidable divine ability. But no matter how powerful the technique, if it can't hit its target, it's as useless as a child wielding a divine weapon."**  

Li Zhengjing felt his body grow cold as a sinister chill spread from his neck, seeping into his flesh.  

The Inner Qi refined through the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique was incredibly potent, protecting his organs and meridians—  

But his muscles and bones were defenseless against the poison's invasion!  

In an instant, his entire body stiffened!  

**"Shit…"**  

The golden-feathered bird circled above, panicking. **"The Divine King Gu's poison is lethal! Even a peak True Qi realm expert would die instantly from a single bite!"**  

Only an immortal, with a transcendent physique, could resist such venom.  

This Divine King Gu was the reason Poison King Xin Xuan dared to look down on all True Qi realm experts, believing himself invincible beneath the immortal realm!  

**"I don't know how you set up this ambush, but I don't have time to interrogate you."**  

Xin Xuan raised his palm, releasing a blade of True Qi that shot toward Li Zhengjing's neck from three zhang away!  

But at that moment—  

The seemingly paralyzed Li Zhengjing suddenly lunged forward, covering over two zhang in an instant!  

His blade descended!  

Xin Xuan's face twisted in horror. He barely managed to raise his right arm in defense, his protective True Qi hastily summoned but not fully formed!  

**Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Blade!**  

Blood sprayed as an arm hit the ground!  

Xin Xuan staggered back, his face a mask of terror!  

Without hesitation, he tore the Divine King Gu from his waist—where it had been healing him—and hurled it forward!  

**"Come on!"**  

Li Zhengjing charged ahead, letting the Divine King Gu bite into his chest. With his left hand, he pressed it firmly against his body!  

A flood of poison invaded his system—  

Only to be drawn into the golden page and refined into pure Inner Qi, surging back into his body!  

His cultivation skyrocketed in that instant, breaking through to the upper tier of the Inner Qi realm!  

He glared at the horrified Poison King Xin Xuan and sneered, **"Half a year ago, when I hadn't even begun cultivating, you couldn't kill me. Now, what can your Divine King Gu do to me?"**  

The golden-feathered bird above gasped. **"A body impervious to all poisons? Unaffected by the Divine King Gu's venom?!"**  

Xin Xuan, now armless, slumped to the ground, panting. **"You… you truly fear no poison?"**  

In all his years, he had never encountered someone who could survive the Divine King Gu's bite!  

The strongest opponent he had ever faced was the Kunlun Young Master, who had repelled the Divine King Gu with his perfected True Qi.  

But even the Kunlun Young Master—unless he transcended mortality—would die instantly if bitten!  

Yet this young man before him had taken the bite and remained unharmed!  

Li Zhengjing's eyes gleamed as he raised his blade.  

**"With just Inner Qi realm cultivation, you dare dream of killing me?"**  

Xin Xuan roared in fury. **"Even an army of experts couldn't stop me! What makes you think you can?!"**  

Though armless, his True Qi still surged around him—  

And like his Divine King Gu, it was laced with deadly poison!  

With a thought, his True Qi condensed into a blade, slashing toward Li Zhengjing!  

Even without his insects, he was still a True Qi realm powerhouse!  

A starved camel was still larger than a horse—even crippled, he was stronger than any Inner Qi realm cultivator!  

**"…"**  

Li Zhengjing released the Divine King Gu and raised his left arm—  

**Divine Fire Sword!**  

A blade of fire, brimming with sword intent, erupted forth!  

The flaming sword pierced through Xin Xuan's protective True Qi—  

And in that instant, it tore through his chest!  

The residual force blasted out from his back, shattering a boulder into charred fragments!
