Chapter 67: Incomplete Spirit Tool

Facing everyone's gaze, Lu Xu shook his head and slowly said, "I still need to carefully consider this matter!"

He was somewhat hesitant. From the current situation, if he couldn't obtain a Tier 2 formation, it would be absolutely impossible for him to kill a Tier 2 demonic beast on his own. However, joining this demon hunting group might expose some of his secrets. Moreover, from Hu Jun's intentions, it was clear he wanted his daughter to reach Foundation Establishment first, then Mo Qingchan, and finally him. Lu Xu could not accept this order. So he planned to try on his own first. If it truly didn't work out, he would then seek cooperation.

Hu Jun's eyes flashed with a hint of disappointment upon hearing this, but he quickly smiled. "This matter is of great importance, so it's understandable that Brother Han needs to consider it carefully. In that case, let's tentatively settle it today. Brother Lin and Brother Han still need to think it over, but the rest of you fellow daoists have chosen to join, right?"

The old woman and the others all nodded.

"Good. All of you present are top experts in the nearby streets and alleys, and many among you have extensive connections. After we return, let's try to recruit as many people as possible. We must make this happen!"

After saying this, Hu Jun stood up, a mysterious smile suddenly appearing on his face. "Additionally, there's one more thing I want to tell everyone: in ten days, the Moonbone Secret Shop will hold a trading fair. Perhaps some items that interest you will appear there!"

"Fellow Daoist Hu says this, it seems I must attend this secret shop's trading fair!"

"Haha, this old man will definitely be there in ten days!"

After Hu Jun's birthday banquet ended, Lu Xu returned directly to his home.

"Mo Qingchan seems to be paying too much attention to me. Is she suspicious of my identity?"

"It's indeed a bit difficult to completely deceive her, a successor of a Foundation Establishment power in Wei State, with the 'Han clan' story!"

"But it doesn't matter. With my current cultivation, what can she do even if she discovers something?"

"As for the demon hunting group, let's see in ten years. If I can't obtain a demonic core on my own within ten years, then I'll have no choice but to join the demon hunting group!"

Lu Xu intended to treat the demon hunting group as a last resort. If he exhausted all his methods and still couldn't obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill, then perhaps that would be his only option. Otherwise, he would have to take the dangerous path of self-Foundation Establishment, or simply expose his alchemy skills and let the Merchant Alliance consider him an alchemy genius. In that case, the Merchant Alliance might give him a chance to achieve Foundation Establishment in order to cultivate a high-tier alchemist.

But in the future, it was a given that he would be controlled. After all, he wasn't someone the Merchant Alliance had raised from a young age; they would definitely not trust his loyalty. The entire cultivation world knew the nature of rogue cultivators. When these guys faced a crisis, not biting you back would already be considered having a conscience. Thinking of this, Lu Xu's mood couldn't help but feel heavy.

"The path for a rogue cultivator to achieve Foundation Establishment is too difficult!"

Ten days later, after changing his appearance, Lu Xu arrived in front of a small shop in a corner on the south side of the outer city district. The shop looked very simple, with a plaque hanging above it, bearing the words "Moonbone." This was the Moonbone Secret Shop, also rumored to be the secret shop managed by Hu Jun.

Standing far away on a street, Lu Xu saw figures walking from various parts of the city, converging into that shop. A moment later, he too moved forward. Upon entering the shop, an ordinary-looking woman approached him. She asked in a hoarse voice, "Fellow Daoist, what brings you here?"

Lu Xu swept his divine sense and discovered that this woman was precisely Hu Yan, Hu Jun's daughter, in disguise.

"I've come to participate in the trading fair!"

"This trading fair requires participants to have a cultivation base of Qi Condensation Layer 6 or higher. Fellow Daoist, could you display your cultivation?" The woman's hoarse voice sounded again.

Lu Xu nodded, releasing the aura of a Qi Condensation Layer 7 cultivator. The woman didn't use the Spirit Eye Technique to check. Using the Spirit Eye Technique in such a place was a great taboo and would invite a group attack. After she confirmed that Lu Xu's cultivation met the requirements, she turned and walked into the shop, saying, "Participating in this secret market trading fair requires a fee of five spirit stones. If fellow Daoist agrees, please follow me!"

Lu Xu put on a ghost mask, then paid the five spirit stones. Under the woman's guidance, he arrived in a dim room inside the shop. She opened a secret passage. After walking more than ten zhang within it, their vision suddenly cleared, revealing a spacious hall. Inside the hall, dozens of figures sat sparsely, each exuding a mysterious and unfathomable aura. These people had all applied some disguise, but under Lu Xu's divine sense, nothing could escape detection.

"Mo Qingchan, Talisman Master Wang... Tsk, tsk, there are quite a few familiar faces!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

He had already participated in quite a few secret market trading fairs, so he skillfully found a corner and sat down, quietly waiting. Half an hour later, when about a hundred people had taken their seats in the hall, the main door closed. An old man wearing a fierce ghost mask stood up from a chair.

He walked to a high platform in the center, cupped his hands in all directions, and said, "This old man is Master Moonbone. Many thanks to all fellow daoists for gracing this old man's secret shop with your presence!"

Lu Xu's divine sense swept over him, immediately knowing that Master Moonbone was indeed Hu Jun. Hu Jun was quite cautious. Not only did he wear a ghost mask on his face, but he had also used some method to alter the face beneath the mask. Even if others used the Spirit Eye Technique, they would absolutely not be able to see through his true appearance. However, before Lu Xu, he had nowhere to hide.

"This old man won't say much about the rules of the trading fair. Now, this old man will initiate the first transaction of this trading fair!"

Saying this, Hu Jun took out a jade box and placed it on the table. "This old man has a scroll of artifact refining legacy left by a Tier 1 High-grade Artifact Refiner. It contains a large amount of artifact refining knowledge. If one diligently studies it, they have the potential to become a Tier 1 High-grade Artifact Refiner!"

"This scroll of notes is for exchange for a bottle of Qi Gathering Pills or something like a Fire Thunder Pearl!"

After Hu Jun's words fell, silence filled the hall. A moment later, people continuously stepped forward to examine the artifact refining legacy, some nodding, some shaking their heads. Eventually, this artifact refining legacy was exchanged by a hooded cultivator.

After the first transaction was successful, others immediately stepped forward one after another, presenting items they wished to exchange. Lu Xu currently had nothing he wished to sell, and few of the items others brought out caught his eye. So, he just watched quietly.

Thus, after more than a dozen people had gone up, he saw Mo Qingchan suddenly move. Mo Qingchan walked onto the platform, her entire body enveloped in a wide black robe, making it impossible to discern what lay beneath. A hoarse, aged voice emanated from her, "One incomplete spirit tool!"

As soon as these words were uttered, it was like a stone thrown into a lake, immediately stirring up ripples.

"What? A spirit tool?"

"Someone can actually bring out a spirit tool?"

"This is something only Foundation Establishment cultivators can use; Qi Condensation cultivators can't activate it at all!"

"Wrong. It's true that Qi Condensation cultivators cannot activate a complete spirit tool no matter what, but the requirements for an incomplete spirit tool are not that high. Qi Condensation Great Perfection cultivators can barely use it once or twice!"

"Doesn't that mean this incomplete spirit tool can allow a Qi Condensation cultivator to unleash Foundation Establishment level power?"

"How is that possible? The power gap between Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment is like heaven and earth, absolutely insurmountable. However, for a Qi Condensation cultivator, this kind of item is indeed an over-spec trump card!"
