# Chapter 67: Rewards from Dao Sect

Li Changxiao went to Dao Sect, and Yang Ji began his secluded cultivation once more.

A Sky Spirit Fruit entered his mouth, and a burst of fragrance instantly exploded. The refreshing fruit scent was intoxicating, its rich fragrance so potent it seemed to penetrate his very bones. The Sky Spirit Fruit had no pulp; instead, it was a viscous, honey-like liquid, flowing with brilliant light and dispersing spiritual radiance. Yang Ji felt his body stir, and he swallowed it instinctively.

Waves of potent medicinal energy dissolved and were immediately drawn by the circulation power generated by the True Steel Divine Art within his body, converging into the spiritual energy vortex in his Dantian, where the refinement began. Yang Ji could feel that the medicinal power of the Sky Spirit Fruit not only contained vast spiritual energy but also possessed the ability to nourish his body. A portion of the medicinal energy transformed into faint streaks of glow, rushing into his internal organs and limbs, strengthening his physique.

Seeing this, Yang Ji immediately activated Humanoid Weapon. The golden tadpole runes hidden within his body and soul manifested on his skin, instantly activating streams of Dao momentum, linking with the great power between heaven and earth, drawing in spiritual energy to temper his physique. This tempering method was somewhat similar to a Nascent Soul True Monarch's Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol. The Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol could connect with the grand trends of heaven and earth, and by leveraging the power of heaven and earth, it could unleash heavenly might. With a single point of a finger, the Heaven and Earth Origin Qi within dozens of miles would boil, and heaven and earth would tremble, incredibly powerful. But clearly, the Gloomy True Monarch was not among them.

After more than six years of arduous cultivation, the Humanoid Weapon had achieved initial success. Although Yang Ji's body didn't appear as robust as Mang Biao's, when he exerted force, his blood vessels bulged, and his muscles coiled like dragons, clearly visible and as hard as refined steel. The first volume of Humanoid Weapon was only at initial success, but without spiritual energy protection, low-grade magic artifacts could already barely harm his physical body. Even a sharp flying sword merely produced a series of sparks when it grazed him, leaving no white mark. In other words, at this moment, his body was already as tough as a low-grade magic artifact.

Yang Ji could feel that if the first volume of Humanoid Weapon were cultivated to perfection, his body's strength would reach the level of a top-grade magic artifact. If he obtained subsequent cultivation methods and continued to practice, he could in the future receive spirit artifacts barehanded, defend against treasure artifacts with one hand, or even withstand Dao artifacts and immortal artifacts. While resisting Dao artifacts and immortal artifacts might sound exaggerated, if the cultivation path could continue in this manner, it was theoretically feasible. If the upper limit of the obtained cultivation method didn't reach that level, he would inevitably use his golden finger to constantly experiment and deduce, exploring the path ahead and completing the cultivation method, thus forging an astonishing body-refining cultivation method.

Of course, these were Yang Ji's current lofty aspirations. Presently, he didn't have that much time for trial-and-error deductions; diligently cultivating to break through realms and obtain a longer lifespan was the proper path. After all, cultivation methods weren't easy to create. Crafting a Dao-level cultivation method required a tremendous amount of time and effort. With his mere two hundred years of lifespan, Yang Ji dared not act recklessly. For now, it was best to diligently cultivate by standing on the shoulders of his predecessors.

He practiced Humanoid Weapon during the day, and at night, he delved into the Returning to Concealment Sword Dao and Zhou Tian Teleportation. Naturally, he also didn't neglect consuming Sky Spirit Fruits and Demonic Essence Pills to enhance his cultivation. Such mundane cultivation passed day by day. The secret chamber knew no spring or summer, no autumn or winter. But Yang Ji, lowering his gaze, could see his lifespan dwindling day by day.

[Lifespan: 35/200]
[Lifespan: 45/200]
[Lifespan: 59/200]

He couldn't help but sigh that time truly flew by once one reached adulthood. Unintentionally, twenty-five years had passed in a flash, and he was now fifty-nine years old. The face of a fresh-faced youth also bore the merciless marks of time; his features were no longer tender but had gained a few stern angles.

Time rushed by, and during this period, he had pondered a question. What was cultivation for? And what was longevity for? He thought long and hard and arrived at a mundane truth. Perhaps the pursuit of longevity was merely to have ample time to engage in boring contemplation and aimless daydreaming, just as he did now.

Twenty-five years of secluded meditation—this was Yang Ji's longest period of secluded cultivation since he began cultivating. Now, he decided to go out and get some air.

As soon as he pushed open the secret chamber door, Jian Yuanzi, who was meditating in the main hall, suddenly opened his eyes, and with a flicker of his figure, appeared before him with a smile.

"Excellent, my disciple, you are not far from breaking through to the Golden Core realm."

"Thanks to the sect for continuously providing high-grade Demonic Essence Pills, otherwise, I don't know how long it would take to reach the Golden Core realm," Yang Ji said with a slight smile, then suddenly asked, "By the way, Master, has there been any news from Senior Brother since he went to Dao Sect?"

"I was just about to tell you about that." Jian Yuanzi smiled, his expression quite pleased. "Your Senior Brother Changxiao successfully passed the assessment and joined the Limitless Dao Sect. Furthermore, ten years later, he passed the second assessment again. He has now initially established himself; he just needs to pass the third assessment to permanently remain in the Dao Sect."

"Senior Brother passed the second assessment?" Yang Ji exclaimed with delight. "With Senior Brother's abilities, passing the third assessment won't be difficult either. Master, you've been to Dao Sect and met geniuses; didn't you say Senior Brother's comprehension and talent are comparable to those with Saint Bodies? Senior Brother might not have a Saint Body, but he's better than one!"

"Indeed, the sect thinks the same way. We hope Changxiao succeeds," Jian Yuanzi smiled with satisfaction. "When Changxiao passed the second assessment, Dao Sect sent people to bestow a large number of rewards."

"Oh? What kind of rewards?" Yang Ji asked curiously.

Jian Yuanzi laughed: "There's one low-grade treasure artifact, a replica of the Haotian Mirror. Three top-grade spirit artifacts, six high-grade spirit artifacts, nine mid-grade spirit artifacts, and twelve low-grade spirit artifacts. Among them are treasure armors, sabers, spears, swords, and halberds—everything imaginable."

"As for pills, there are ten Wind Tribulation Pills, ten Fire Tribulation Pills, and ten Thunder Tribulation Pills. These three types of pills correspond to the wind, fire, and thunder tribulations of Nascent Soul True Monarchs, respectively. After consumption, they can effectively protect the primordial spirit, greatly increasing the success rate of transcending tribulations. With these pills, our sect can ensure a continuous supply of Nascent Soul True Monarchs."

"Additionally, there are Barrier-Breaking Pills for the Qi Refining to Golden Core realms, ten pills for each realm."

"It's just a pity that Dao Sect didn't bestow any pills that could advance cultivation or improve aptitude; the rewards are random, which is quite regrettable."

"Besides that, Dao Sect also bestowed one mid-grade spirit vein and three low-grade spirit veins. This alone is tens of millions of spirit stones—truly a grand gesture."

Jian Yuanzi laughed, "If Changxiao can successfully pass the third assessment and permanently remain in Dao Sect, then every hundred years thereafter, Dao Sect will bestow a large amount of cultivation resources upon our Azure Ripple Sect. The benefits are truly endless. By then, Changxiao will be eligible to specify the rewarded items, as long as their total value doesn't exceed the total sum of the reward. If they could bestow a few Enlightenment Pills, our Grandmaster might even break through to the Void Refinement realm. At that time, our Azure Ripple Sect would truly stand firm in this Thousand Islands Sea Region."

Upon hearing this, Yang Ji sighed slightly, "Dao Sect is truly generous." Whether it was treasure artifacts or Wind Tribulation Pills, these were all good things, basically unseen in the Thousand Islands Sea Region. Perhaps the three great sects each had one or two treasure artifacts, but they simply couldn't produce these kinds of pills due to the lack of required spiritual materials for refining. Dao Sect giving out thirty pills at once was truly generous. With these pills, the Azure Ripple Sect could definitely produce another three to five Nascent Soul True Monarchs. These were treasures that would lay the foundation of the sect, and in some sense, they were far better than treasure artifacts.
