Chapter 318: Helpless in the End, Captured at Last

The crowd was thrown into an uproar. Those like Mu Hongchou, Luo Feiyan, Hua Wu, and Yang Wentian, who had only heard of his name but never seen him, and those like Wang Dezhong, Zhou Shijie, and Yue Kai, who had seen his shadow but not his person, all fixed their gazes upon him.

They saw a youth with a white face and a red bow, standing tall and proud, his long hair flowing, possessing an extraordinary aura. Though his face was masked, his posture and demeanor suggested that his features must be exceptionally handsome. The prodigies present all felt a sense of self-abasement, as if in a dream, thinking to themselves: "Since childhood, I have consumed precious elixirs, practiced the martial path, trained in archery and literature at three, and cultivated my nature. I have always been a leader among my peers, favored by seniors and admired by my fellows. Now, there is a person of the same age who, relying solely on his archery skills, makes us look up to him in awe. Previously, I only heard his name and vaguely thought this person might be a fraud. Now that I see him with my own eyes, his elegance is indeed extraordinary. My feelings are complex and hard to put into words; I can only sigh at my own inferiority."

The elders of various factions inwardly praised: "What a heroic and valiant young man, what a legendary divine archer. With such a bearing, he can be called unparalleled."

Zhou Shijie stared at him, feeling as if he were sitting on pins and needles, overcome with a sense of inferiority and an infinite sense of loss. He had inherited a great fortune since childhood, with his peers unable to even see his back, envying his capabilities. Now, the situation had changed. Though he was still a top contender, he had become "just one of the crowd," reduced to looking at someone else's back and admiring their brilliance.

He couldn't help but be sensitive in his thoughts, observing Gu Nianjun's expression. He saw her eyebrows and eyes were fully extended, her gaze filled with a strange light. She tried to maintain a calm expression, but her fists were clenched tightly, crinkling the edges of her skirt. It was clear that her heart was surging with emotion beyond measure.

He took a sip of fine wine, but both the wine and the meat tasted flavorless. This gap in status was truly indescribable. As the red mist finally dissipated, Xu Hu赞道: "Good, young hero, good young hero. Was it you who hunted the spirit fox?"

Li Xian remained silent, looking at Wen Caishang. Wen Caishang smiled faintly and said, "My young hero, Elder Xu is asking you a question. Why don't you reply?"

Li Xian knew he was already in her grasp. He sighed inwardly, forcefully suppressing his palpitations, and maintained his composure. He said, "Yes, it was I who hunted the spirit fox."

Wang Tiexin praised, "Truly worthy of being an expert in the Dao of archery; his spirit is indeed sharp and soaring. My son, Dezhong, was once ignorant and narrow-minded. He competed in archery with this young hero and returned in a great defeat, crying to me about it. I told him, 'There are heavens beyond the heavens, and people beyond people.' The earlier you understand this truth, the better."

Wang Dezhong's face flushed red as he said, "Father, give me some face."

Everyone burst into laughter upon hearing this. Wen Caishang asked with a smile, "Young hero, what is your name? Where is your home?" Li Xian said, "My surname is Zhou, name Ping'an. I have no fixed abode; I am a wanderer."

Wen Caishang laughed, "Young Master Zhou is quite the joker. Come closer." Li Xian thought to himself, "I am already here; I can only submit for now. Alas, even if I don't submit, what can I do?" He took a few steps forward.

Wen Caishang said softly, "Closer." Li Xian did as he was told, striding forward boldly until he was before Wen Caishang's table.

Wen Caishang's face was like a blooming flower, yet a chilling寒意 subtly radiated from it. Her delicate hand rested on Li Xian's wrist, subtly channeling her Qi. Li Xian felt a sudden, needle-like pain all over his body, and cold sweat involuntarily streamed down, his face turning deathly pale in an instant. This one move had already caused internal injuries, yet there was no external damage whatsoever.

This technique of Wen Caishang's was called the "Heavy Pulse Finger." She sneered inwardly, "How could I let a traitor off easily? With my Heavy Pulse Finger, you can forget about escaping again."

Still not venting her anger enough, she applied a bit more finger Qi, which secretly locked Li Xian's internal Qi. She looked Li Xian over with her beautiful eyes, seeing that he remained stubborn and showed no change in expression, just as he had been in the past.

Wen Caishang let go of his hand and laughed, "Truly a heroic young man, barely over eighteen years of age. Lord He... it seems this time, your archery skills have truly been defeated by this eighteen-year-old youth."

Li Xian's Qi and strength were greatly diminished, feeling keenly the lingering finger Qi in his body, which constricted the meridians for exerting force and blocked the acupoints for circulating Qi. The depth of her martial arts attainment, the completeness of her techniques, the endless changes in life and death—Li Xian had been with Wen Caishang for a long time. He had only seen her easily defeat enemies, but never understood the evolution of the principles behind it. Now that he felt it personally, he realized the unfathomable subtlety of it, which was beyond words.

To resolve it was not simple. But on the surface, he appeared fine, standing by Wen Caishang's table. Everyone else thought that Wen Caishang was appreciating Li Xian, and that she was now feeling his pulse and bones to check his age. They all secretly envied him.

Li Xian's back was slightly damp with cold sweat. He Wentian laughed magnanimously, "As the saying goes, 'New talents emerge in every generation, and the rear waves drive the forward waves.' The emergence of such a young hero in my Flying Dragon City is truly my good fortune."

Wen Caishang said, "Good young hero, I have prepared a table for you. Please take a seat over there." She pointed to a table beside her, where the dishes were already served and the seat had been kept vacant.

Li Xian quietly sat down. Wen Caishang looked at his calm and usual demeanor and thought, "Truly a rare hero. Even when facing a great disaster, he remains so calm. What a cunning brat. No matter how sly as a fox you are, with the heavens and earth now cutting you off, you should have no tricks left."

Li Gang asked, "This young hero is wearing a mask. We cannot see his face clearly. I remember Madam Wang mentioned another condition: that he must be handsome. Why don't we ask this young hero to remove his mask and show his face?"

Gu Nianjun was extremely curious, and the many young prodigies all cast their gazes upon him. Wen Caishang smiled, "This matter is up to him." She looked at Li Xian.

Li Xian thought, "I have been captured by the Madam; my life is uncertain. Whether my face is shown or not makes no difference. Why add another trouble? These people are strangers to me and will not help me. It's better to continue hiding; there might be a turn of events." So he said, "I appreciate everyone's kindness, but it is inconvenient for me to show my face. I must disappoint you all."

Mu Hongchou said in a charming voice, "What's so special about a face? Are you very ugly?" Li Xian smiled, "Indeed, it is strange. My apologies."

Gu Nianjun sighed, "Young Master Zhou is unwilling to show his face; forcing him is useless."

Wen Caishang's gaze was sharp, casting a sidelong glance at Li Xian. She figured that these two women had heard of his reputation and secretly admired him. If Li Xian were to be intimate with her, she would not allow the two women to even look at him. But now that he had turned his back on her, this resentment would be settled on Li Xian's head.

Wen Caishang said淡淡ly, "It seems Young Master Zhou has quite a charm, already causing waves among his peers. This young woman proposes a toast to the young hero."

Li Xian's scalp tingled, his heart feeling as if bitten by ants. He had no choice but to return the toast. Wen Caishang waved her hand, and the banquet became lively again, with everyone enjoying the dishes and conversing with each other. There were songs and dances, fine wine and jade nectar. The prodigies made new friends, and the wandering cultivators chatted with the powerful and noble.

It was a scene of great liveliness.

The elders were curious about Li Xian, but seeing that Wen Caishang was speaking closely with him, and no one else could get a word in, they didn't force their way in. They turned their attention to other matters. At the front of the banquet, Wen Caishang asked softly, "Young Master Zhou, are you satisfied with this banquet?"

Li Xian drank and said, "Very satisfied." Wen Caishang said, "As long as you're satisfied, don't say that Caishang has neglected you." Li Xian said, "Wen..."

Wen Caishang said, "You've said it wrong, I am Wang Yiyi. You may call me Madam Wang. You are now Zhou Ping'an, so I will call you Young Master Zhou." Li Xian said, "Madam Wang, I..."

Wen Caishang's eyes flashed with a strange light. "What does Young Master Zhou want to say?" Li Xian said with a bitter smile, "I... am flattered."

Wen Caishang chuckled softly, "I don't see that you are flattered. You look more like..." She didn't finish.

Li Xian remained silent. Wen Caishang said, "Why don't you ask me what you look like?" Li Xian said, "Please tell me, Madam, what do I look like?"

Wen Caishang said, "You look like you're about to face a great disaster!" Li Xian thought, "Even if I die, it's better than dying a cowardly death." He said frankly, "Everything I have is thanks to the Madam. If you want to take it back now, I am right here."

Wen Caishang said淡淡ly, "So you know it's thanks to me. Hmph, there are too many people here. Come back with me, and we'll settle the accounts today." Her expression was icy, her resentment and anger undisguised. Her martial arts were extremely profound, making it difficult for others to eavesdrop.

In an instant, she became charming and lovely again, saying to the crowd, "This young woman is not feeling well. The banquet is set, and wine and meat will be served one after another. Everyone, please enjoy yourselves. This young woman will take her leave first."

Wang Tiexin, Peng Sanluo, Xu Hu, and the other elders from various sects all replied, "Please go ahead, Madam Wang."

Wen Caishang smoothed her clothes, her movements elegant. She slowly stood up and walked. Seeing Li Xian still sitting at the table, she called out softly, "The Human Elixir is at my residence. Please follow me to collect it, Young Master Zhou. With so many heroes and valiant men as witnesses, this young woman will not deceive you."

Li Xian said, "Thank you, Madam." He had no choice but to harden his scalp and follow. They walked out of the lively street. The scent of light fragrance lingered at the tip of his nose, and her graceful figure was right before his eyes. The crowd gradually thinned, and the chill around him grew stronger. He saw that Wen Caishang's beauty was as timeless as ever; her makeup today was rarely seen even in the past. She was breathtakingly beautiful, but he had no heart to appreciate it.

They arrived at a carriage.

Wen Caishang stood quietly. The atmosphere was tense. Li Xian hardened his scalp, took a few steps forward, and felt under the carriage for a red jade carriage step, placing it beside the carriage. Wen Caishang stepped on the carriage step and boarded the carriage.

Li Xian helped her as before and lifted the carriage curtain. Wen Caishang entered the carriage compartment and said, "You come in too. Xiao Tuan, you handle the carriage."

Xiao Tuan held the reins and sat on the driver's seat at the front. She looked at Li Xian with curiosity, her eyes filled with schadenfreude. By now, Li Xian had regained his composure. He bent down and entered the carriage compartment, finding a side seat and sitting down.

Xiao Tuan raised her whip. "Giddy up!" The carriage started, swaying slightly. It was extremely quiet, so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Li Xian saw that Wen Caishang had her eyes closed, resting, and remained silent for a long time. He thought, "I cannot escape this fate; my end will be miserable. Hoping for Wen Caishang to be magnanimous and let me go is absolutely impossible. Before I die, I might as well be a bit more carefree."

He retracted his restrained posture. Seeing that there were fruit plates and pastries on the table, which were exquisite and delicious, Li Xian had not eaten anything during his carriage ride earlier. He was curious about the taste, so he picked up a "Snow Jade Soft Pastry" and ate it. The taste was exceptionally delicious.

Li Xian did not disturb her. He ate and drank the pastries while riding along. Not long after, they arrived at the Blue Fragrance Pavilion. Xiao Tuan's voice came from outside, "Madam, we've arrived."

Wen Caishang slowly opened her eyes and glanced sideways at Li Xian. Li Xian immediately exited the compartment, placed the red jade carriage step, and lifted the carriage curtain again, saying, "Madam, please get off the carriage."

Wen Caishang nodded slightly. Li Xian helped her down again, their movements intimate as before. They entered the Blue Fragrance Pavilion, and Xiao Tuan closed the door and bolted it.

The scenery in the courtyard was serene. Facing them was a layer of green screen. Going around the screen, the courtyard gradually unfolded before them, earning the reputation of "One step to surprise, two steps to sigh, three steps to linger, a hundred steps to forget to return."

Wen Caishang said softly, "Xiao Xian, there are no outsiders here now. Take off your mask."

Li Xian said, "Alright." He took off his mask. Xiao Tuan was extremely curious and immediately opened her eyes wide to look. Seeing Li Xian's flawless handsomeness, which truly surpassed all the prodigies she had seen, she couldn't help but let out an "Ah!"

Li Xian asked, "Madam, who is this..." Wen Caishang said softly, "You little white-eyed wolf, you still dare to ask. If you hadn't left silently, leaving me so lonely, why would I need to find another child to accompany me?"

Hearing Wen Caishang's soft and gentle tone, as if she wasn't blaming him at all, Li Xian felt even more terrified. He would have preferred a few sword stabs; though painful, they would be predictable. He pondered: "The only way to survive this is through sweet talk and trying to please the Madam. Though she is shrewd, she likes to hear sweet words." He said, "I was inconsiderate; I truly... truly deserve to be punished. To be honest, every day and every moment I was outside, I missed the Madam. I always hoped for the day we would meet again. Now that we have finally met, I have no regrets even if I die."

Wen Caishang smiled, "Oh?" Li Xian said, "Back then, when I left without saying goodbye, it wasn't that I abandoned the Madam, but rather..."

Wen Caishang asked, "But what?" Li Xian was eloquent, but at this moment, he was somewhat at a loss for words. He could only harden his scalp and say, "But I, Li Xian, come from a humble background. It was only with the Madam's protection that I was able to set foot on the martial path. The Madam is so beautiful and so powerful. After spending time together, I felt deeply unworthy. Perhaps it was my self-esteem that caused me to... to be possessed by a demon and want to leave the Madam. The day after I left the Madam, I regretted it immensely. I have been tormented day by day, and my heart has never stopped thinking of the Madam."

Wen Caishang's eyebrows arched like flowers, listening with great pleasure. She said, "You... this stubborn nature of yours still hasn't changed. You can say anything. If what you say is true, then tell me what you usually think of me?"

Li Xian supported her closely and said, "To speak frankly, I'm afraid I might offend the Madam." Wen Caishang said, "Haven't you offended enough already? Just say it."

Li Xian said, "The first thing I think about every day is the Madam's appearance. Since leaving the Madam, I have not seen any woman who could rival the Madam. I miss her like crazy, always feeling as if the Madam is by my side. I long for her like a madman, as if every woman has traces of the Madam. Perhaps a slight resemblance in her eyebrows, or a two-part similarity in her red lips... When I look at them, my mind is filled with the Madam's face, but they are far from being a fraction of the Madam. I once thought... if I could not see the Madam again, no matter how vast the world, it would be tasteless to me. I was so depressed I was on the verge of madness, suffering greatly in my heart."

Wen Caishang covered her mouth and giggled, "Go on." Xiao Tuan followed behind, her skin crawling with goosebumps. She thought, "Such cheesy words, he can actually say them out loud. And the Madam is so strange, she can actually listen to them. Oh dear... I'm going to die of cheesiness."

Li Xian supported Wen Caishang, walking and talking in the courtyard. The scent of her fragrance lingered at his nose. The beautiful scenery and the beautiful woman were by his side, yet he felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles, with no heart to appreciate it. He continued, "To be ashamed, the second thing I miss is the Madam's scent. The light fragrance teases the nose and lingers for a long time. It can only be smelled beside the Madam... The third thing I miss is the Madam's clothes..."

He said all he could, though he intended to flatter, it wasn't entirely false. Wen Caishang enjoyed it, hearing his heartfelt and vivid words, which had a touch of sincerity, and found it even more pleasing. She thought, "This brat's strength has grown, his wit has grown, and his ability to use sweet talk to please people has also gradually grown. I wonder if it's self-taught or if he has practiced with someone."

Li Xian said, "These thoughts are all ordinary. What I miss the most is indeed the journey along the river with the Madam, and the various things that happened between us. I miss the Madam teaching me about calligraphy and painting."

Wen Caishang's heart stirred upon hearing this, her beautiful eyes rippling with strange light. Li Xian said, "Madam, there is a step here, please be careful." He helped her carefully.

Wen Caishang nodded and stepped over the step. They entered a garden where flowers were in full bloom, a riot of color, and the scenery was breathtaking. Wen Caishang said with pity, "That must have been hard for you, to miss me so much."

She gently caressed Li Xian's face, her eyes shimmering with waves, but hidden undercurrents were surging. She said, "Good Li Lang, did you suffer any bullying outside?"

Li Xian said, "Generally fine, but there were always a few who were unreasonable and brutal." Wen Caishang laughed, "Is that Hao Qing Snake? I have already taught her a lesson for you. She will not dare to offend you again."

Li Xian said, "Thank you, Madam." Wen Caishang said, "Between you and me, why speak of thanks? Heaven has pity, and you have returned to my side, safe and sound, and everything will go smoothly."

They arrived at a stone pavilion. Wen Caishang said, "I am tired. Help me sit down." Their movements were intimate, their skin touching, as if the ice had melted.

Wen Caishang guided Li Xian to sit beside her and poured him hot tea. She said, "Xiao Tuan, come here. Bring the accounts."

Xiao Tuan said, "Alright." She ran into the inner room. Along the way, she had followed them and heard all the sweet talk. Seeing that the Madam seemed to be enjoying it, she was quite confused. She thought, "With the Madam's intelligence and status, why does she like to hear such things? Such cheesy words, how can he say them out loud? Strange, strange. The Madam is very angry with him, why doesn't she just stab him with a sword? Why does she still allow him to offend her and be so close? The Madam's skin is like ice and jade; I've never seen her allow any man to touch her."

She was full of doubts. She really didn't know that Wen Caishang had a strange temperament. The angrier she was, the less she showed it, instead speaking softly and gently, as warm as spring water. The better her mood, the more ferocious she became. Her current gentle and soft demeanor was hiding a sharp blade, preparing to settle accounts. Li Xian's sweet talk was indeed useful. Wen Caishang was genuinely happy to hear it, and her anger was somewhat dissipated. Several times, she was moved and her emotions surged, as if returning to the intimacy of the past. But how could she be so easily fooled?

Xiao Tuan brought out the accounts. Wen Caishang reclined, her legs resting on Li Xian's knees. The风情 of her skirt was hard to hide. Her ankles were white and delicate, her embroidered shoes exquisitely made, with phoenix patterns embroidered on them, exuding a faint fragrance. She said languidly, "Read it out."

Xiao Tuan said, "Golden Rain Dew Fragrance... fourteen thousand taels of gold, a total of four sticks burned. The sum is fifty-six thousand taels of gold. The relocation of the One Harmony Manor, starting from Qingning County in Qiong Tian Mansion, moving to the Mu'e Mansion. The labor cost was sixteen thousand taels of silver. The damage to the carriages and horses on the way was nine thousand five hundred taels of silver. The consumption of grain on the way was three thousand five hundred taels of silver... The purchase of the Blue Fragrance Pavilion cost three hundred forty-nine thousand taels of silver..."

Xiao Tuan read from the accounts as if reciting a celestial script, detailing every event. Wen Caishang said, "In total, it's two million nine hundred seventy thousand taels of silver. Li Lang, this is what you owe me. What do you plan to do?"

Li Xian wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, wanting to stand up. But Wen Caishang's feet lightly rested on his knees,无形中 restricting his entire movement. Li Xian said, "Madam, I... when did I owe such a huge debt?" He was secretly lamenting.

Wen Caishang said, "Li Lang, I relocated the manor for you, and I spent money to find you. Naturally, this money is on your account." Her gaze was resentful, she sighed softly, and then said, "If you were deceiving me, and everything you said just now was false, and you actually had other intentions from the start, leaving the manor to develop elsewhere, then this money naturally cannot be counted on you. Alas... then there's nothing I can do. Though I helped you with your martial path, you saved my life. The accounts are settled. If you leave the manor now, you are not in the wrong, morally or rationally. I will not stop you."

Li Xian knew well that Wen Caishang loved to test people. If he followed her words now, he would be dead in the next instant. He said, "Madam, I truly don't have so much money, but what I said just now was not to deceive you. I never thought of betraying the manor. It is my fault that I caused the Madam to spend a great fortune for me. I will definitely find a way to repay it."

Wen Caishang's face showed joy. The tip of her foot pressed against Li Xian's chest, and she raised it slowly with great interest. She said with delight, "Good, good, Li Lang. You are being very obedient now. Good Li Lang, obedient Li Lang, you have not disappointed me. You are a good man, and also a good lad."

Wen Caishang asked, "So you are determined to repay this money?" Li Xian said, "I will do my best to repay it." He took out his money pouch. All his belongings were worth barely a thousand taels, a drop in the bucket.

Wen Caishang said, "Far from enough. Li Lang, how do you plan to repay the rest of the money?" Li Xian said, "I..." He was just thinking of a plan.

Wen Caishang said softly, "Why don't I teach you a way to slowly repay this money?"

Li Xian knew it could not be a good thing, but he could only say, "Please tell me, Madam." Wen Caishang said gently, "The ancients said... a faithless person must be sliced by a thousand cuts. Though you did not mean to be faithless to me, and I believe your explanation that my Li Lang would never deceive me, I have still been heartbroken for you. Why don't... Li Lang, for every slice you endure, it's worth one coin. You repay this debt well, endure some pain, and I..."

She was full of tender affection, her pretty face slightly flushed, as if whispering sweet words on their wedding night. But her words were as chilling as a deep pool: "Then... I will forgive you."

Li Xian's scalp went numb. He thought, "Even if one slice is worth one tael of silver, with nearly three hundred thousand taels, I would still lose my life. What's more, one slice is only worth one coin. After millions of slices, who could survive? It seems the Madam hates me to the bone and wants to chop me into meat paste to vent her hatred. She's just finding an excuse to kill me."

As she spoke, her toe tapped Li Xian's acupoint, immobilizing him. Li Xian frowned deeply, unable to move. He kept thinking: "I know the Madam is ruthless. She will do what she says. I expected this when I attended the banquet, but hearing her words, I still couldn't help but feel heartbroken."

"If you had fallen into my hands, I would not have wanted to hurt you in the slightest. You are the guide on my martial path, and we have entangled affections. But in return, you want to treat me like this. Killing me is not enough; you want to slice me countless times. Fine, fine. This calamity is hard to escape. If you want to chop me into a bloody mess and scatter my soul, I will cut all ties with you completely."

His true feelings were revealed. In his heartbreak, he was also open-minded and resolute. He said:

"Since it has come to this, so be it."

"Wen Caishang, if you want to kill me, what difference does it make whether it's a thousand slices or ten thousand slices? What's the use of more nonsense? You hate me so much. Whether you want to kill or slice, as you wish. I will die in peace and will not entangle myself with you in any more karmic debts."

Wen Caishang couldn't help but be flustered. Seeing Li Xian's determination and frankness, she quickly said, "No, no, I didn't say I wanted to kill you. You like me, and I like you very much. We have a long time ahead of us. You can slowly repay it. I... I want to make you suffer a bit, to remember the lesson, not to really hurt or kill you."
