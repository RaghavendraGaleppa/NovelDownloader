# Chapter 19: Hall of Bright Virtue

Yu Xiaobao felt deeply wronged. *I am fighting for your son to become the heir, Second Brother. How could you betray me like this?*

Yu Xiaobao hurriedly said, "Second Brother, if even your Ziming isn't qualified, then who among the Yu family's younger generation could possibly be..."

"Ahem!" Yu Second Uncle coughed twice, cutting him off before he could finish.

"Xiaobao," Yu Second Uncle said calmly, "you've always been an impulsive boy. Now, you're already a grandfather. Why are you still so unsteady?"

Yu Xiaobao's face flushed crimson instantly. "Second Uncle, what do you mean by that?"

Yu Second Uncle replied indifferently, "As the old saying goes, 'Long illness makes a good doctor; long life makes a wise man.' Although your eldest brother's health is a bit weak, it isn't a serious condition. Furthermore, Chengye and Chenglin are both from the main line of the eldest branch. The order of seniority must not be disrupted... Our Yu family has been passing down its legacy for hundreds of years. How could we do without rules?"

Yu Xiaobao retorted, "Second Uncle, aren't all rules made by men? Chengye was unfortunate and passed away early. Chenglin is still too young. If something were to happen to him, and our Yu family had two heirs in a row die young, what would outsiders think?"

Yu Sixth Uncle suddenly spoke up. "How can you, as an uncle, curse your own nephew like that? Chengye was already an adult when he met his accident. By your logic, if we were to choose an adult heir, would that guarantee that no accidents would ever happen?"

Yu Xiaobao was taken aback. *Second Uncle's family has some influence, so it makes sense for them to speak up. But you, Old Six? Aside from your seniority, what else do you have?*

Although he sensed something was off, he couldn't figure out exactly what it was. Yu Xiaobao had always been quick-tempered. Now that he was angry, he didn't care about seniority and immediately shot back with a sarcastic remark.

However, Yu Huanhu, who had been silently observing, couldn't help but change his expression.

This Sixth Uncle's branch of the family had absolutely no power or influence. Usually, he only dared to chime in on harmless topics that wouldn't make any enemies. How dare he get involved in such a sensitive matter as appointing an heir?

Just as Yu Huanhu realized something was wrong, the elders from various branches began to voice their opinions one after another.

"Naturally, all the descendants of our Yu family are excellent. But for the sake of the long term, it is more stable to establish someone from the main line of the eldest branch."

"I agree with Old Six. Chenglin should be established as the heir."

"What Old Six said makes sense. From a long-term perspective, establishing Chenglin has more advantages than disadvantages."

The Yu family had been passed down for nearly three hundred years. Now, the entire clan, including the main and side branches, had a total population exceeding six thousand. There were also about ten branch heads. When these ten branch heads and the elders joined in, it was as if a group of ministers had stepped forward in court, each proclaiming, "Your humble servant agrees!"

For a moment, Yu Old Six was so excited that the pockmarks on his face turned red. He had never felt so glorious before. The feeling of having everyone respond to his call was truly intoxicating.

Yu Old Six was so excited he let out a...

Yu Xinglong waited quietly for all the elders to finish speaking before turning to Yu Huanhu and asking calmly, "Second Brother, what do you think?"

Yu Xiaobao, who had been ignored and treated as if he were invisible, flushed with embarrassment. He felt like a clown.

"Hehe..." Yu Huanhu let out a dry laugh.

Seeing the elders from various branches step forward, he knew that something must have happened that he didn't know about. Regarding the struggle between the main line of the eldest branch and the second branch, the old foxes from the various branches usually avoided getting involved at all costs. Why were they all jumping in now? There was clearly something going on.

But he didn't know what exactly had happened that could make these elders take sides. Thinking of this, Yu Huanhu smiled calmly and said, "The opinions of the branch heads and elders are all prudent and well-considered. I, Huanhu, also agree."

For a moment, Yu Xiaobao felt like he was the fool, his face alternating between green and red. He let out a cold snort and shamelessly sat back down in his chair.

Yu Xinglong nodded. "Since that is the case, this Clan Head hereby announces the establishment of Yu Chenglin as the heir of the Yu family. Tomorrow, we shall all go to the ancestral hall to report this to our ancestors."

Yu Second Uncle, Yu Sixth Uncle, and the others couldn't help but secretly breathe a sigh of relief. They were truly afraid of the main line of the eldest branch and the second branch coming to blows. They could handle a war of words; in a war of words, they could still reap some benefits. But physical conflict was absolutely unacceptable. If the family fortune were to be destroyed in a fight, they would be the first to suffer. Therefore, they had to step forward and publicly support establishing Yu Chenglin as the heir. This was the result of Yu Xinglong contacting and communicating with them one by one over the past few days. They needed the Clan Head to consider the big picture and avoid the family's split, and this was the price they had to pay. They believed Yu Huanhu was secretly grateful to them as well.

*Who told you to dare go against the world and do such a thing?* Even if you did it, you didn't clean up properly and left a handle in someone's grasp. Although this handle lacked sufficient witnesses or physical evidence, if the Clan Head were to truly explode with rage, could you blame an old man filled with the grief of losing a son?

At the same time, the branch heads and elders also intended to use this opportunity to warn Yu Huanhu, because assassination had crossed their bottom line. *You have the ability, so go ahead and compete, but you cannot use暗杀 (assassination) methods. Today, you dare to assassinate the heir; if tomorrow I don't support you in vying for the Clan Head, are you going to assassinate me too?*

Seeing that Yu Huanhu had wisely chosen to back down, the old foxes secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

Yu Second Uncle said, "Clan Head, it is the season for spring plowing, and each branch has many事务 (matters) to attend to. Since the heir's status has been established, after we pay our respects to the ancestors tomorrow, can we return down the mountain?"

Yu Old Six said, "Yes, the Clan Head has been overworked these past few days and needs a good rest."

Yu Xinglong smiled slightly. Before he could speak, a hoarse and powerful voice sounded from outside the Hall of Bright Virtue: "Everyone, please wait. I, Suo Er, have something to say!"

A vigorous-looking man in his early fifties strode into the Hall of Bright Virtue. The old man was tall and, although his back was slightly hunched, he still stood about nine feet tall. He had a half-bald head, thick and messy gray eyebrows, and a large aquiline nose. His gaze was imposing.

Yu Xinglong immediately stood up from his seat of honor and clasped his hands in salute. "Master Suo Er."

The elders and branch heads in the Hall of Bright Virtue didn't all recognize Suo Hong. At least someone like Yu Old Six, an elder with no real power, didn't know him. However, seeing the Clan Head treat this person with such respect and address him as "Master Suo Er," those who didn't know soon figured it out. If nothing else, this should be the second master of the Suo family from Jincheng, Suo Hong.

Suo Hong's gray eyebrows twitched slightly, and he said in a deep voice, "Clan Head Yu, I, Suo, have just received a piece of news. The death of your Yu family's heir was not the work of bandits looting for money. It was instigated by someone, using the pretense of robbery to carry out an assassination."

The moment these words were spoken, the entire hall was stunned. Those who had been unaware were greatly shocked, and the elders who had gone to the dungeon with Yu Xinglong also suddenly woke up. They had all thought that establishing Yu Chenglin as the heir was the condition for the Clan Head to give up on making trouble for Yu Huanhu. They hadn't realized that the Clan Head's appetite was even greater? The Clan Head had played the part of a grieving father to win their support and establish the heir, but now he was using Suo Hong's mouth to launch another attack?

Yu Xinglong knew these elders would be dissatisfied with him because of this, but in his heart, he could only sneer. This was the opportunity his son had secured with his life. How could merely an heir's position be enough to satisfy him?

Yu Xinglong put on a look of shock and exclaimed, "What? How could this be? Who was the mastermind?"

"Of course, it was..." Master Suo Er extended a finger, slowly sweeping it across everyone's faces, and finally pointed it at Yu Huanhu. "It was him, the second line of your Yu family's eldest branch, Yu, Huan, Hu!"

The people in the Hall of Bright Virtue were shocked once more. For a moment, all the clamor turned to silence, leaving only the sound of rain dripping outside the hall.

Looking at the finger pointing at him like a sword, Yu Huanhu slowly stood up.

Yu Huanhu said coldly, "Master Suo Er, food can be eaten indiscriminately, but words cannot be spoken carelessly."

Yu Xiaobao, who had been ignored by his eldest and second brothers, felt he had lost all face. He had been sitting there resentfully, but seeing this scene, he couldn't help but secretly become excited again. *If the main line of the eldest branch and the second branch get into a big fight and both suffer heavy losses, wouldn't the third line of the eldest branch have a chance to rise?*

Suo Hong said coldly, "After your Yu family's heir, Yu Chengye, was murdered, Clan Head Yu sent Steward Yi She to receive the coffin. Steward Yi learned that they had captured a bandit alive and interrogated him. The bandit confessed on the spot that you instigated them to kill Yu Chengye."

Yu Huanhu roared, "Nonsense! How could I harm my own nephew? Master Suo Er, bring that bandit here. I want to cross-examine him in court."

Suo Er looked coldly at Yu Xinglong. "I, Suo, also want to question that bandit thoroughly. I heard that the bandit has already been taken into custody by you, Clan Head?"

Yu Xinglong remained silent for a moment before replying, "That bandit's injuries were too severe. Not long after he was thrown into the water prison, he died."

Upon hearing this, Yu Huanhu's heart immediately eased. He wasn't a fool. How could he not see that his eldest brother was putting on a show with Suo Er? However, he wasn't sure just how big his eldest brother's appetite was. If his eldest brother pushed too hard, he would have to fight with all his might. But once the main line of the eldest branch and the second branch came to blows, they were destined to both suffer. By then, the other seven clans would immediately swoop in like vultures feeding on carrion, dismembering and devouring the Yu clan. As the Clan Head, his eldest brother naturally didn't want to face such a situation, and neither did Yu Huanhu, who harbored ambitions to replace him.

Now, the "bandit" was "dead," which meant his eldest brother didn't want to fight him to the death. Knowing his eldest brother's bottom line, Yu Huanhu became composed. He said coldly, "So, you, Master Suo Er, have no evidence whatsoever. You just want to forcefully accuse me of being the criminal based on your sharp tongue alone?"

Suo Hong said sternly, "The bandit is dead? Even if the bandit is dead, there is still corroborating evidence. I, Suo Er, ask Clan Head Yu to summon him to the Hall of Bright Virtue to explain everything clearly in front of everyone!"
