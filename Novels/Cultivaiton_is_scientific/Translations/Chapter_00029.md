# Chapter 29: Assassination

Li Shiming maintained steady breathing, just as he would while asleep. 

For others, simulating sleeping breaths might leave telltale signs, but with the help of his IBMz15 mainframe server, his breathing perfectly mirrored that of true slumber. Even the experienced night intruder failed to detect his feigned sleep.

The intruder took two light steps to reach the bedside, his gleaming dagger aimed straight for Li Shiming's chest.

Li Shiming moved. A low-grade flying sword talisman suddenly appeared in his hand, glowing with an eerie spiritual light as he channeled qi into it. 

The sword swept out from beneath the blankets, slicing through the quilt before the intruder could react. For a Qi Refining second-level cultivator to engage in close combat with a martial arts expert was unwise—but Li Shiming was merely a second-level cultivator in appearance only. 

He only knew how to infuse the flying sword with spiritual energy, not how to unleash its true power. Had he not caught the intruder off guard, he would have resorted to talismans immediately. Still, he wasn't completely unprepared—he had already donned a low-grade magic robe. Even if struck, the blade couldn't harm him.

At such close quarters, technique mattered little. Li Shiming's second-level physical conditioning served him better. His swordplay had no finesse—only speed. 

By the time the intruder sensed danger, the blade had already severed both his arms.

"Ah!" The intruder's piercing scream immediately alerted those outside.

Li Shiming didn't stop. A second swing of the sword took the man's legs. 

Enhanced by spiritual energy, the flying sword's sharpness was beyond question. Li Shiming barely felt resistance as he reduced the intruder to a limbless torso. Facing a martial arts master, he'd chosen the safest approach—complete incapacitation.

He spared the man's life only to interrogate him.

With the bedroom door locked from inside, Siqin pounded anxiously outside. Meanwhile, two guards leaped through the open window while the other two pulled Siqin aside and broke down the door.

"Young master, are you alright?" The first two guards asked urgently upon seeing the maimed intruder.

As the door gave way, the remaining guards entered. Seeing Li Shiming unharmed as he rose from bed, their tension eased. Had anything happened to him, they wouldn't have known how to answer for it.

"Young master, we've failed in our duty," the lead guard bowed deeply. Having just arrived at the old residence, they'd planned to start night watches tomorrow—who could have anticipated an attack tonight?

"Tend to his wounds and take him to the back room. I'll question him shortly," Li Shiming ordered sternly. He didn't blame the guards—this intruder was skilled enough that even had they been on watch, they might not have detected him.

"Yes, young master!" The guards applied emergency medicine to the intruder's wounds. Though severe, the injuries wouldn't prove immediately fatal.

Soon, Moyan, Steward Zhang, and other servants arrived—some even armed with kitchen knives and clubs.

"Steward Zhang, preserve the bedroom as is. Arrange alternate quarters for Siqin," Li Shiming instructed before comforting the shaken maid, "It's alright, Siqin."

This was the capital, not Nanling. The proper procedure here was to report to authorities. To do so effectively, the crime scene must remain intact.

"I'll stay with you!" Tears streamed down Siqin's face, but she stood firm.

"Rest now. There are things you shouldn't see," Li Shiming said gently with a smile.

As he stepped into the night toward the back room, all warmth left his eyes. Had he been an ordinary person tonight, he would have died. He needed to know who wanted him dead—his childhood memories of the capital were too vague to provide clues.

In the back room, the intruder was bound to a wooden chair, his mask removed to reveal a bearded man in his fifties.

"Leave us," Li Shiming commanded.

"Young master—" the lead guard began to protest but fell silent under Li Shiming's icy gaze, quickly ushering the others out.

The guards were stunned. Their young master was clearly no feeble scholar—the cold efficiency with which he'd disabled the assassin spoke of both decisiveness and ruthlessness.

Despite his horrific injuries, the bearded man remained conscious, staring intently at Li Shiming. He couldn't forget that brilliant sword flash—so fast he couldn't dodge. The pain from his severed limbs made him crave death over living as a cripple.

"Kill me!" he begged.

"Death won't come so easily," Li Shiming said coolly.

His consciousness sifted through the IBMz15's database, searching through ancient and modern interrogation techniques. Time constraints ruled out many methods, so he selected several acupuncture points corresponding to the body's most sensitive pain nerves.

As the needles pierced these points, the man convulsed violently. This new agony eclipsed even the pain from his wounds, which the emergency medicine had dulled. The selected nerve clusters delivered pain exceeding human tolerance.

"AHHH! Please! Kill me! Let me die!" The man's screams reached new heights.

Outside, the guards exchanged uneasy glances. What manner of torment could elicit such cries?

"This is just the beginning. Tell me your name and who sent you," Li Shiming said calmly.

He'd avoided more gruesome methods—he himself couldn't stomach excessive gore.

The bearded man ignored the question, howling continuously as if the screams might alleviate his suffering.
