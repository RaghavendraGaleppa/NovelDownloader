## Chapter 21: The Blood Bamboo Forest

In the faint night, mountains stood tall, covered in patches of larch, hazel, birch, and other trees. Although the tree species varied, most had already shed their leaves, leaving only bare branches laden with white snow.

Qin Ming trekked through the accumulated snow, crossing several mountains before nearing the Blood Bamboo Forest. He had never set foot in this area before; it was no longer considered the outer region of the mountains. Along the way, numerous mountain beasts roamed, and strange bird calls constantly echoed. But upon reaching this point, apart from the whistling cold wind, all other sounds mysteriously vanished. Qin Ming realized the danger of the Blood Bamboo Forest; all kinds of creatures in the mountains detoured around it, rarely venturing in. This was still the severe winter, with its blanket of white snow. If the period of active fire springs arrived, with nature awakening and blood snakes emerging to hunt, the vicinity would likely become even more silent.

“The scenery is quite beautiful,” Qin Ming said, standing outside a valley and looking in. The Blood Bamboo Forest lay within the valley. Although the sky was rather dark, one could still clearly see the vast expanse of bamboo standing tall in the wind and snow, a fiery red hue covered with white snow, breathtakingly beautiful. The valley was filled with blood bamboo, a beautiful sight. This plant, from its stalks to its leaves, glowed crimson, like red coral growing into a dense forest in the snow.

“This truly is a wonderful place,” Qin Ming exclaimed. On normal days, no one would dare come here to enjoy the scenery. The blood snakes' fierce reputation was far-reaching, making even mountain rangers extremely wary. No light from the fire springs was seen emanating from the valley; they seemed to have truly died out. However, Qin Ming did not step into the valley. He believed there might still be “embers” beneath the frozen earth, and the fire springs here might not have completely vanished. He circled the area, observing the nearby terrain. Climbing up a high slope, he looked down from above and indeed, in the center of the valley, there was still an extremely faint “red glow.”

Qin Ming pondered for a moment, then turned and left this quiet place, heading to an area with more strange birds and mountain beasts, where he caught a rabbit in the snow. “My apologies,” he muttered, holding the plump snow rabbit. He returned near the Blood Bamboo Forest, stood on the high slope, and with a powerful throw, hurled the snow rabbit towards the “red glow” area in the center of the valley. With a thud, the large rabbit landed in the thick snow, sending up a large spray of snowflakes. It wasn't far from the embers of the fire spring.

Almost simultaneously, a red streak shot out, sweeping across the snow, darting towards the rabbit with astonishing speed and instantly piercing its body. Qin Ming's concentration was absolute; ripples of shattered gold appeared on his skin. His eyes were fixed on the not-so-distant center of the valley. Undoubtedly, it was a blood snake, just over three feet long. As rumored, its body was as hard as refined iron, capable of briefly leaping into the air and piercing its target like an iron arrow.

“It truly is a dangerous creature. This is still a relatively small snake. If a several-meter-long one appears, it would be difficult to deal with,” Qin Ming frowned. The main thing was that even in such a cold season, the blood snakes were still active, capable of briefly moving through ice and snow. This was quite tricky. He then saw several more red streaks emerge from the “red glow,” each only a few feet long. This time, they didn't shoot out like iron arrows but instead crawled along the snow, reaching the snow rabbit. Their hard snakeheads pierced into the rabbit's body. Such spiritual snakes could not be measured by common sense; they were not as afraid of the icy wilderness as imagined and could not be frozen stiff in a short period.

“Am I providing you with winter supplements, an unexpected extra meal?” Qin Ming watched the Blood Bamboo Forest. The several blood snakes were clearly sucking the snow rabbit's warm blood. These snakes were named “blood” not only because of their appearance but also due to their feeding method, which differed from ordinary snakes that swallowed their prey whole. They fed very quickly, perhaps because they didn't want to stay long in the snow, and soon moved towards the nearly extinguished fire spring.

“Hmm?” Qin Ming noticed that two of them did not immediately return to their nest. Instead, they rapidly crawled through the Blood Bamboo Forest, as if searching for something. At the same time, he noticed a larger snakehead appearing within the “red glow,” constantly flicking its bright red tongue, seemingly sensing something.

“A bit troublesome,” Qin Ming realized. These deadly spiritual creatures were powerful and extremely alert, much harder to deal with than other mutated creatures. He wondered if he could fight poison with poison, sending them some toxic blood-food. However, seeing that the large snake showed no signs of eating, and a smaller snake always tasted first, he decided this method was not very feasible.

Qin Ming noted that after the two three-to-four-foot long small snakes rapidly moved in a large circle within the Blood Bamboo Forest, their speed clearly slowed. They finished patrolling their territory and submerged into the “red glow” of their habitat.

“The icy weather still has a significant impact on them; that's good news,” he said, walking down the slope and retracing his steps. He planned to transport various weapons. Once he delved deep into the Blood Bamboo Forest, he would definitely need to wear three or four layers of the mountain patrol team's armor. He didn't want to be ambushed by a blood snake; if its refined-iron-like head pierced the skin, even a Newcomer would surely die. It didn't take long for him to excavate and transport the iron spears, armor, and other items, hiding them near the Blood Bamboo Forest.

“To deal with blood snakes, Fu Entao's sharp long blade is actually more effective than the long-handled black-gold hammer.” While heavy weapons were indeed powerful when attacking larger mutated creatures, capable of a single-hammer headshot, using them against slender snakes was simply not as effective as a long blade. Qin Ming pondered when the fire springs in the Blood Bamboo Forest would completely extinguish. The longer they remained extinguished, the weaker the blood snakes would become. However, he didn't have much time either, as the final negotiation between the higher-ups and the top-tier mutated creatures in the mountains would be completed within the next few days.

“I've 'stirred the grass and alerted the snakes' today, making them vigilant. I'll come back tomorrow,” Qin Ming retreated. Although time was somewhat pressing, one day wouldn't make a difference. “I should be able to deal with this nest of blood snakes, right?” he mused on the way. Feng Yi'an, Shao Chengfeng, and others had wanted to target the Blood Bamboo Forest, but he had annihilated that entire group. He felt he couldn't be careless; he had to be cautious.

On his way back, he spotted three large mutated fowl running through the forest at extreme speed, carrying people on their backs, cutting across the dense forest ahead of him. “People from Golden Rooster Ridge?” Qin Ming hid behind a large tree and, upon seeing this scene, guessed their identity. They were three mutated ground chickens, each over a person's height, extremely strong, capable of carrying people rapidly through the mountains and forests. Only Golden Rooster Ridge in this region could cultivate such creatures. Qin Ming had heard of Golden Rooster Ridge. It boasted fire springs close to Level Two. Earlier, a large bandit group had been there, but they were eventually pacified. This was because the mutated ground chickens they cultivated were extremely practical; mountain rangers sometimes needed to enlist their Golden Rooster Knights to investigate conditions deep within the mountains.

“Golden Rooster Ridge is very far from here. How did their people get here?” He watched the three ground chickens depart. One of the riders wore excellent armor, unlike a local, and their attire was completely different from the other two from Golden Rooster Ridge. “From Scarlet Cloud City?” Qin Ming noticed that the style of the person's black armor was different from those of the Cao, Wei, and Mu families; they were likely from another major family. Seeing that they weren't heading towards the Blood Bamboo Forest, Qin Ming continued his journey home.

Just as he was dragging a hunted animal and about to leave the mountains, he saw four unusual Newcomers. Two of them, although without armor, were clearly dressed remarkably. Black robes woven with metallic threads covered their entire bodies, concealing their faces. Qin Ming was surprised and suspicious. The mountain-sweeping operation hadn't even begun, yet the mountains were already becoming lively. Who were these people? The other two Newcomers seemed to be locals, both in their early thirties. One of them greeted him with a smile: “Little brother, do you know if there's a glowing silver fissure nearby?”

Qin Ming realized that they were looking for a special node. It seemed the two black-robed figures also most likely came from Scarlet Cloud City. “Head that way, walk straight for three *li*, and you'll reach it!” Qin Ming pointed the direction. That place wasn't some secret location; many people already knew about it.

“Little brother, please lead the way for us. We'll give you a Night Silver afterward,” the man asking for directions said with a smile. Qin Ming took two steps back and said, “I'm afraid of that place. The fissure is very dangerous. Besides, I need to hurry back; I haven't caught any prey for many days, and my old mother is almost starving.”

“Let's go,” one of the black-robed men spoke, his voice sounding quite young. Hearing this, Qin Ming also prepared to leave. However, the next sentence from the black-robed man froze him. “Deal with him. Our presence here should not be known by too many people.” The black-robed man's nonchalant remark directly decided the fate of a “young hunter.”

Qin Ming was stunned. Where did these demons come from? To casually decide someone's life or death showed too much disregard for ordinary people's lives. He had met Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, Mu Qing, and others who also came from Scarlet Cloud City. Those people were all very amiable; regardless of whether they were maintaining the proper etiquette and courtesy of nobles, they were at least outwardly acceptable and not off-putting. Yet, this black-robed man was simply too “decisive and ruthless,” with no emotional fluctuations, simply ordering the two local Newcomers who were guiding them to kill.

“Brothers, we're all locals; we can't do this,” Qin Ming said. One of them chuckled: “Apologies, brother, but we're ordered to accompany these two distinguished guests into the mountains and must obey all their commands.” “You are…?” Qin Ming asked. “We are from the Three-Eyed Cult,” the two locals said, advancing together.

The next moment, Qin Ming moved like an agile leopard, leaving an afterimage in his wake as he rapidly darted forward. The short sword in his left hand instantly slit both their throats. The two men from the Three-Eyed Cult were stunned, terrified, and incredulous. They thought they had encountered an ordinary hunter, as Qin Ming's hunted prey was small, merely a rock sheep. Yet, they were inexplicably slit at the throat; their opponent was too fast.

When the two black-robed figures saw Qin Ming charging and realized that the long-handled black-gold hammer he drew from his back was exceptionally heavy, their expressions instantly changed. Qin Ming's black-gold hammer in his right hand smashed towards the head of one of them, while the short sword in his left hand stabbed at the other black-robed man. Since the other party had already decided to kill him to ensure their whereabouts remained unknown, there was no point in saying anything more. He could only retaliate with all his might. Instantly, the clash of metal weapons erupted between the three, exceptionally piercing.

With just a brief clash, Qin Ming understood their capabilities. One was a Second-Stage Newcomer, while the other was not a concern, having only undergone rebirth once. He attacked the Second-Stage Newcomer with full force; only this person posed a threat. Before this, he might have had to fiercely battle the opponent for some time. But after studying the blade manual today, the help it provided was immense. While not a complete enlightenment, it significantly elevated his combat skills.

“Clang!” After several clashes, the powerful black-robed man's long blade was struck by the black-gold hammer, bouncing high. His arm went numb. At the same time, his pupils contracted, for the long-handled black-gold hammer, wielded effortlessly by the opponent, shot towards his chest like a bolt of lightning, at a speed he couldn't hope to match. It was too late for him to dodge. His chest caved in from the impact, and he spat out large mouthfuls of blood, clearly not long for this world.

“Fighting me with a blade?” Qin Ming muttered, gripping the long-handled black-gold hammer and employing a blade technique. He didn't even spare the downed man a glance, turning to press towards the other black-robed figure. The other person was shocked. He had just been forced back, and his companion was dead in no time. It was too fast; how could a youth who looked like a hunter be so terrifying? Knowing he was certainly no match, he turned and dashed into the dense forest, intending to flee.

“Throwing Blade Style!” Qin Ming uttered these words. With a loud thud, the long-handled black-gold hammer flew out, and the head of the black-robed man not far away shattered like a rotten watermelon. Qin Ming wasted no time, quickly clearing the battlefield and cleaning the bloodstains from the long-handled black-gold hammer with snow. He then resumed his journey home, dragging his prey.

However, he was a little uneasy. So many people were entering the mountains now, of all sorts, so he couldn't stay away from the Blood Bamboo Forest for too long. After eating, he quietly returned to the mountains. “Each day that passes, the fire springs will dim considerably, which is advantageous for me. But I must also be wary of outsiders breaking in to contend for the spiritual treasures,” Qin Ming murmured to himself. For now, he could only guard this place. He didn't leave until close to midnight, as no one would choose to make a move at such an hour. The pitch-black night had little effect on snakes, but Newcomers would be restricted.

The next day, he entered the mountains early and found that the “red glow” in the center of the valley had indeed dimmed considerably. With this discovery, he decided to wait a bit longer, making his move no later than before the end of this evening. An hour later, the entire mountain area suddenly became resplendent. Endless “earth light” rose, and a sky full of light rain appeared, illuminating the nearby area completely. Earth light surged, and rosy light flowed. This wondrous sight captivated Qin Ming; it was indeed incredibly beautiful. Especially here, the fiery red bamboo forest complemented the pristine white snow, truly fresh and stunning, forming a magnificent scenery unlike any other.

“Hmm?” It was at this moment that Qin Ming made a discovery: a group of people was approaching in the distance. He didn't panic. Instead, he calmly retreated into the shadows. This was good; if this group was coming for the spiritual treasures of the Blood Bamboo Forest, he would let them scout the way first.
