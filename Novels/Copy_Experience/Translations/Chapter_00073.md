# Chapter 72: Hunting a Second-Order Demonic Beast

The Golden-Arrow Bow was a high-grade magical artifact Lu Xu had acquired at a secret market trade fair previously. At that time, he primarily bought this magical artifact to deal with demonic beasts.

Taking out a long arrow that matched the bow, Lu Xu drew the bow and nocked an arrow, aiming it from afar at a cave located halfway up Blackwood Peak.

Boom!

His entire body's spiritual energy began to boil, continuously pouring into the longbow. The golden arrow began to erupt with dazzling light.
