# Chapter 78: Assist Me in Killing the Creditor!

The stone bridge ended abruptly ahead, leading to the base of Mount Fengdu.  

Originally, the bridge extended straight to the mountain's base, but it was broken here, like a breach in a dam. The water of the Yellow Spring and the sinister energy surged upward through this gap, flooding Mount Fengdu.  

"Return along this path!"  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official spoke gravely. "Everyone, prepare yourselves!"  

"My master has been corroded by the Yellow Spring's water. I fear he can no longer use the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique," the Hanging Wall Bird said anxiously.  

"Earlier, I protected him with my magic power. His internal injuries are temporarily stable—only superficial wounds remain!" Yuan Zhengfeng said. "But his eyes have been corroded. He can't see the formation's traces and may not grasp the right moment."  

"What if you enter his body again?" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official asked.  

"With my Human Immortal-level magic power, I might rupture his meridians, bones, and flesh again, worsening his injuries!" Yuan Zhengfeng replied.  

"Forget it!" The Ghost Valley Spirit Official glanced back. Unaware that the Mystic Shadow Ghost King had stopped, he still feared pursuit and felt pressed for time. Taking a deep breath, he said, "This isn't a quiet place, but we have no other choice! Xuji Zhenren, guard the perimeter!"  

"No! I won't go back!" Xuji Zhenren protested, plopping onto the bridge and kicking his legs like a petulant child. "I want to wait here to die and then go to the underworld..."  

"Xuji Zhenren!" Yuan Zhengfeng said. "You heard earlier—this body is a remnant of the Underworld Lord. It will eventually be restored and return to the underworld. When that happens, I'll accompany you! For now, you must obey..."  

"Fine." Xuji Zhenren reluctantly stood up and began guarding the area with his magic power.  

"My master also has a treasure from the Buddhist sect!" The Five Elements Creation Tree pulled out a string of prayer beads from the Wutong Wood Box. "This seems capable of setting up a formation!"  

"White Hanging Wall, scatter the beads around the perimeter!" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official instructed.  

"Got it!" The Hanging Wall Bird picked up the beads with its beak and placed them around.  

"Five Elements Creation Tree, stand by!" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said. "Now that your Yin-Yang and Five Elements are complete, you possess great fortune. If anything goes wrong, we can cut a piece of you to save your master!"  

"..." The Five Elements Creation Tree froze in place.  

"Ready!"  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official took the bundle from Li Zhengjing's hands and slowly unwrapped it.  

A brilliant light erupted, illuminating the surroundings.  

Countless ghosts and spirits trembled and fled the area.  

Even the Yellow Spring's waters seemed to calm, and the sinister energy was suppressed.  

Inside the bundle were three items: a letter, a short whip, and a jade box.  

Without time to examine them closely, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official opened the jade box.  

A green light shimmered, growing increasingly radiant.  

Under its glow, everyone felt a surge of vitality—especially the Five Elements Creation Tree. With each breath, it grew taller, its newly sprouted branches thickening and strengthening.  

"Is this the Dao treasure left by the Heavenly Azure Dao Lord? How can an inanimate object possess such boundless vitality?" Yuan Zhengfeng marveled.  

"The Heavenly Azure Dao Lord was peerless in talent. Legends say his vitality was inexhaustible—no matter the injury, he could heal instantly," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official mused. "Before coming here, I theorized that his Dao treasure contained a remnant of his foundation, part of his essence."  

He retrieved the item from the box—a green pearl brimming with endless vitality—and murmured, "It seems I was right. The pearl is inanimate, but it is indeed part of the Heavenly Azure Dao Lord's foundation. Once implanted in Young Zhengjing, he'll gain immense vitality..."  

Yuan Zhengfeng gasped. "Will he possess the Heavenly Azure Dao Lord's talent?"  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official shook his head. "This treasure is only part of his foundation, not the complete Dao Lord's body. At best, it grants half of it."  

"In the future, he will inevitably suffer backlash from the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi. But with the Dao treasure implanted, his vitality will heal the injuries, sparing his life."  

"However, this is only a temporary solution. As the sword qi grows stronger, the treasure's vitality won't keep up. It treats the symptoms, not the root cause."  

"But for now, it's enough."  

Even as he spoke, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official worked swiftly, slicing open Li Zhengjing's abdomen and implanting the Heavenly Azure Dao treasure into his dantian.  

His hands moved with precision, his expression calm and assured.  

His medical skills were nothing short of miraculous.  

There was just one problem—he didn't use anesthesia, making the procedure horrifying to witness.  

The Hanging Wall Bird trembled at the memory.  

Xuji Zhenren paled, his eyes filled with dread.  

"This is a minor procedure. Compared to modifying his Blazing Fire Divine Ability last time, it's much simpler," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said casually. He then prepared Li Zhengjing's charred and corroded left arm, explaining, "The Heavenly Azure Dao treasure's vitality is endless. I must ensure the 36,500 muscle fibers in his left arm aren't healed as wounds—they need to be rearranged."  

"What does that mean?" the Hanging Wall Bird whispered.  

"If his arm were severed, the treasure might regenerate it. But since he still has both arms, a third won't grow," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said. "I'm just using a small trick to stabilize these muscle fibers, making them function like an innate ability so they won't be 'healed' away."  

"I see."  

Li Zhengjing's voice was weak but clear.  

His corroded eyes gradually regained clarity, turning black and white once more.  

His damaged skin peeled away, replaced by new tissue.  

The meridians ruptured by Yuan Zhengfeng's magic power also healed, along with all other minor injuries.  

Moreover, the boundless vitality filled him with immense strength.  

He felt his organs brimming with life. His internal energy cultivation would now progress twice as fast with each breath!  

Though already at the peak of Inner Qi, his left arm's divine ability allowed him to store additional energy, pushing his total to thirteen inches!  

"Young Zhengjing, you've planned well," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official sighed. "Today, we were supposed to return empty-handed, yet you crossed two realms in one step and retrieved this bundle. It seems everything was under your control—even my haste in implanting the Heavenly Azure Dao treasure was anticipated?"  

Li Zhengjing stood slowly and smiled. "Senior misunderstands. I was simply unwilling to leave empty-handed and decided to try my luck."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official gave him a knowing look. "You gambled with your life?"  

Li Zhengjing spread his hands and smiled without answering.  

Earlier, when he borrowed spirit stones from the Ghost Valley Spirit Official, the golden page's fortune-changing method had provided detailed instructions.  

It specified how much magic power to use, the exact moment to strike, where to retrieve the bundle mid-air, when to dive into the Yellow Spring, and the precise path to swim back—all laid out clearly.  

"I won't pry into the oddities. But tell me, how did you cross two realms in one step?" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official asked, puzzled. "Even the Mystic Shadow Ghost King, though seemingly close, struggled to pursue us across. Yet you did it effortlessly."  

Li Zhengjing rubbed his temples. "I don't know either. I just took a step and crossed."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official looked at him strangely but said nothing more.  

Li Zhengjing was equally baffled. He had followed the golden page's instructions precisely, but the mechanics of crossing realms remained a mystery.  

There were also many oddities about the Mystic Shadow Ghost King and the Great Zhou Dynasty's founding Grand Preceptor, but he had no time to ponder them now.  

Regardless, he now possessed the Heavenly Azure Dao treasure, granting him half of the Eternal Azure Saint Body.  

At least before reaching the Human Immortal realm, the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi wouldn't threaten his life.  

Moreover, once he broke through to the True Qi realm, the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord would have no reason to doubt his "Eternal Azure Saint Body" status. Thus, the Divine Lord wouldn't harvest his spare body before he reached the Human Immortal realm.  

"Now that you're healed and our mission is complete, it's time to return."  

"Hanging Wall, retrieve the prayer beads."  

Li Zhengjing gave the order, then turned to the now-awake Five Elements Creation Tree.  

With its Yin and Yang now perfectly balanced, the tree could traverse both the underworld and the mortal realm freely. In the future, cutting it would yield even greater benefits.  

Moreover, the tree could now cultivate and fight, no longer just a decorative snack.  

"Little Tree gained the real fortune this time," the Hanging Wall Bird said enviously as it collected the beads.  

"From now on, call me Tree Lord!"  

The Five Elements Creation Tree stood tall, its five branches waving proudly.  

Hearing this, Li Zhengjing opened the Wutong Wood Box and said flatly, "Tree Lord, please enter. We must return."  

The Five Elements Creation Tree preened and strutted toward the box—until it noticed Li Zhengjing eyeing its branches with a hungry gaze, the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber in hand.  

Instantly, the tree collapsed to the ground, kowtowing. "Master, such a title is too grand for this lowly one! This grandson was just teasing the silly bird! No matter how accomplished I become, I'll always be your most obedient grandson!"  

"Don't be so formal. We're family."  

Li Zhengjing comforted it while stuffing it into the box, lamenting inwardly, *Now that the tree's Yin-Yang is balanced, it's gotten smarter. Harder to find excuses to cut it. Guess I'll have to wait for it to bear fruit...*  

As they prepared to return to the mortal realm, Xuji Zhenren waved and headed deeper down the bridge.  

"I quit the team!"  

Xuji Zhenren crossed his arms. "The Great Zhou's founding Grand Preceptor—that old man couldn't even beat me. If he could ascend to immortality and cross over, why can't I?"  

He looked at the group—one man, one bird, one tree, one traitorous dog, and one broken jade—and declared solemnly, "If I can't cross now, I'll die and cross later."  

Li Zhengjing stepped forward, but Xuji Zhenren retreated.  

"My eyes are sharp. I can see none of you can beat me!"  

Xuji Zhenren assumed a fighting stance, glaring especially at the Ghost Valley Spirit Official. "Anyone who tries to take me with them will die!"  

"Let him be."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official sighed. "Years ago, he claimed to have encountered a 'true god' here and went mad. This place holds an obsession for him. Even the words of this half-dead fellow won't change his mind. Leave him be."  

Li Zhengjing nodded. "To each their own. If this is his conviction, we should respect it."  

He bowed deeply. "Thank you for your protection on this journey, Senior."  

Xuji Zhenren happily waved and ran off without looking back, his cheerful voice echoing:  

"I'll wait here to die! When you're free, come die with me! I'll save you all a spot!"  

"Keep it for yourself!" the Hanging Wall Bird shouted, watching his figure vanish into the sinister mist. It sighed. "Even if he's crazy, he was a strong fighter. I failed to trick him this time—my schemes weren't clever enough. Once we return, I must study harder!"  

"Let's go. Without Xuji Zhenren, returning to Mount Fengdu won't be easy. Stay alert."  

Li Zhengjing stuffed the bird into the box, gripping the Dragon-Patterned Saber in one hand and swallowing Yuan Zhengfeng's broken jade with the other.  

Previously, each use of Yuan Zhengfeng's magic power would damage his meridians, flesh, and bones. But now, with the Heavenly Azure Dao treasure, he had no such worries.  

"Come!"  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official spread his golden wings, grabbed Li Zhengjing's shoulder, and leaped forward!  

Flight was nearly impossible here, but the sinister energy and Yellow Spring water surged upward like a volcanic eruption.  

They rode this momentum upward.  

However, the energy and water were highly corrosive and teemed with malevolent spirits.  

Thus, the two worked together to repel the threats.  

With Yuan Zhengfeng's magic power and the Dao treasure's healing, Li Zhengjing could now use his Blazing Fire Divine Ability continuously—effectively a Human Immortal!  

The only risk was exhausting Yuan Zhengfeng's magic power and soul, leading to his demise.  

But the return journey would consume at most 30% of his power, replenishable with spirit stones later.  

"Open!"  

The two Human Immortals pushed through the dangers. At the peak, Li Zhengjing activated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, easily passing through the grand formation—originally from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect and reinforced by various factions.  

"Clear the surrounding evils!"  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official flapped his wings fiercely, ascending!  

At Mount Fengdu's base, all sinister creatures and ghostly soldiers blocked by the formation were driven back by Li Zhengjing's Blazing Fire Sword Qi.  

Soon, they landed safely on the cliff where they had begun.  

But before they could relax, a voice spoke.  

"You ruined my plans."  

The tone was calm and familiar, but it sent chills down their spines—deeper than even the Yellow Spring's cold.  

The voice carried killing intent.  

Li Zhengjing and the Ghost Valley Spirit Official tensed, turning toward the source.  

At the mountain path's edge, a disheveled figure leaned against a rock, his robes torn and hair unkempt—clearly battered.  

The Ancient Moon Peak's Chief of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect!  

His injuries were severe—a gaping wound in his chest still oozing, not yet healed.  

Blood trickled from his lips, his eyes icy.  

Li Zhengjing tightened his grip on the saber.  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official murmured, "He fought three alone and won. His strength surpasses even Xuji Zhenren's. But with injuries this grave, he's at less than 10% of his power."  

He turned to Li Zhengjing. "Though I'm not at my peak, I'm still a Human Immortal. With your Human Immortal-level strength, two against one—victory is assured!"  

Two versus one.  

The enemy was heavily wounded.  

The odds were in their favor.  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page's fortune:  

**Fortune:** Joining forces with the Ghost Valley Spirit Official to kill the severely injured Ancient Moon Peak Chief results in mutual annihilation.  

"..."  

Without hesitation, Li Zhengjing sheathed his saber and stepped forward, feigning concern.  

"Chief, how did you end up so injured? It pains me to see you like this. If only I were stronger to share your burden..."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official gaped in disbelief.  

The Ancient Moon Peak Chief remained expressionless, his killing intent lingering. He raised a hand, summoning an object—the token he had given Li Zhengjing to board the Sky Ship and return to the sect.  

Now, it crumbled to dust in his palm.  

From the dust, countless scenes flickered rapidly.  

The Chief's cold gaze softened slightly, his murderous aura fading.  

He pushed himself up and stood, his voice calm.  

"The Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, channeling ghostly magic to reach half-step Human Immortal. Impressive."  

Li Zhengjing stiffened, his expression solemn.  

The Chief then turned to the Ghost Valley Spirit Official.  

"Exquisite medical skills. Implanting the Heavenly Azure Dao treasure so effortlessly."  

His aura surged, pressing down on them like a tidal wave.  

"Since you both already know your peculiarities, I won't hide it."  

The Ancient Moon Peak Chief spoke slowly.  

"The Great Zhou's founding Grand Preceptor could see the traces behind your creditor at a glance—and so can I."  

He extended a hand, his tone grave.  

"If you wish to escape the fate of being a spare body, hand over the Soul-Striking Whip."  

"Assist me..."  

"**In killing the creditor!**"
