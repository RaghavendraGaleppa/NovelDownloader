# Chapter 78: The Princess of Great Yan  

Old Man Zhang introduced Lin Shan to his colleagues, whose expressions turned sour upon seeing him.  

The auction house appraisers had been fiercely competing for the vacant chief appraiser position after Old Man Zhang's transfer to Yinchuan. Some had even spent large sums of spirit stones on bribes, only for Lin Shan to swoop in and take the spot.  

A greenhorn directly stepping over veteran employees—how could the appraisers tolerate this? However, being seasoned schemers, they first probed Lin Shan's background. Was he from a prestigious immortal family? If he were the scion of some cultivation clan, offending him might bring trouble from his elders.  

After some conversation, Lin Shan stuck to the persona he'd established with Old Man Zhang. He claimed his ancestors had been illustrious but that he was now merely a wandering cultivator.  

With this information, the appraisers felt more at ease. Though none openly opposed him, they silently plotted. After all, Old Man Zhang was still present. Once this year's auction ended and he left, they'd see how long this upstart could last.  

Unaware of their thoughts, Lin Shan maintained a cooperative attitude. On the eve of the auction, under Old Man Zhang's guidance, he mingled amicably with the team.  

---  

The day of the auction arrived swiftly.  

High-level cultivators soared through the skies on flying swords, while exotic beasts pulled carriages through the bustling streets. The once-every-five-years grand auction had drawn the attention of cultivators from northern Great Song and southern Great Yan.  

Among the attendees were members of major sects, cultivation clans, minor factions, and even renowned wandering cultivators who had received invitations. Those without invitations had to pay a deposit and prove their wealth or cultivation level to enter.  

Rumors circulated that over a hundred mid-tier spiritual treasures would be auctioned, with more than a dozen items worthy of being finale pieces in previous years.  

Lin Shan followed Old Man Zhang into a private booth on the second floor. As the chief appraiser for the host, Old Man Zhang naturally had his own booth, though he would soon leave to preside over the auction.  

When the event began, Lin Shan found himself alone in the booth, watching the crowd below. Nearly a thousand cultivators packed the venue—mostly late-stage Qi Refinement practitioners, with a handful who had connections to secure entry.  

Lin Shan couldn't help but marvel at the abundance of talent in the cultivation world. And this was just a fraction of the cultivators from northern Great Song and southern Great Yan.  

The private booths on the second, third, fourth, and fifth floors were reserved for sects, clans, Foundation Establishment wandering cultivators, and possibly even Golden Core experts.

On the auction stage, Old Man Zhang began his opening remarks. Lin Shan wondered if he'd have to host future auctions after taking over. The thought of addressing a crowd that included Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators made him uneasy.  

"Let's begin with our first item—a mid-grade magical garment, the Flame-Resistant Robe!"  

Old Man Zhang wasted no time. The audience eagerly placed bids, showing their enthusiasm.  

Lin Shan sipped tea in his booth, watching the bidding war unfold. With no spirit stones to his name, the treasures on offer were beyond his reach.  

Yet the world never lacked spendthrifts. As the auction progressed, one lavish purchase followed another. Someone spent 1,000 spirit stones on a mid-Qi Refinement peony parrot—just for decoration! Another paid 1,500 for a jar of deep-sea whale oil, claiming it would enhance his cooking!  

Lin Shan nearly blurted out that blue whales were endangered, then remembered that in this world, demonic beasts likely outnumbered humans.  

But the most shocking was the slave trade. Mermaids from the Eastern Sea, serpent women from the Western Desert, witches from the Southern Border—even the Third Princess of Great Yan had been captured and put up for auction!  

"Third Princess of Great Yan, practitioner of demonic arts, guilty of indiscriminate slaughter of mortals. Captured by a sect elder, now bound with a soul-sealing artifact. Late-stage Qi Refinement, suitable for guarding estates or warming beds. Starting bid—1,000 spirit stones!"  

As the chief appraiser and auctioneer, Old Man Zhang enthusiastically promoted each item while explaining its origins.  

Cultivating demonic arts wasn't unusual in Great Yan, but mass murder of mortals violated the ironclad rules of the cultivation world. Mortals were the foundation—if such acts went unpunished, chaos would ensue.  

With irrefutable evidence, the Great Yan royal family had no choice but to accept her capture. Meanwhile, the Great Song royals were delighted.  

"2,000 spirit stones!"  

A Foundation Establishment elder from Great Song's royal family, seated in a third-floor booth, placed the bid. Others withdrew, not wanting to interfere in the two nations' bitter rivalry.  

"Congratulations to the third-floor bidder! The late-stage Qi Refinement Great Yan princess is yours for 2,000 spirit stones!"  

---  

In the third-floor booth, a yellow-robed elder sat on a rattan chair, flanked by a young woman and a middle-aged man—none other than Princess Guo and the brocade-robed man from the prince's estate.  

Having encountered their royal elder in Yichuan, they had joined him to observe the auction.  

"After the auction, I will visit the Murong clan. You two will escort the Great Yan princess back to the imperial palace for His Majesty. Understood?" the elder commanded.  

Princess Guo and her companion bowed in acknowledgment.  

---  

As the auction reached its midpoint, excitement grew.  

Finally, the most anticipated item for late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators appeared—Foundation Establishment Pills.  

"One hundred and ten Foundation Establishment Pills! Twenty per batch, five batches in total, plus ten sold individually!"  

"Starting bid—3,000 spirit stones per pill!"  

Servants brought out five vials and ten jade boxes. The crowd erupted in fervor, including Lin Shan in his booth. The gap between Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment was vast—one still earthbound, the other soaring through the heavens.  

The first five batches of twenty pills each were undoubtedly reserved for the cultivation clans. The remaining ten were the wandering cultivators' battleground.  

Lin Shan watched enviously as the bids for the individual pills climbed to around 5,000 to 6,000 spirit stones.  

"Even wandering cultivators have their wealthy elites," he mused, calculating his monthly salary. As chief appraiser, he earned 100 spirit stones a month. Saving for five or six years might net him one pill.  

He silently thanked Old Man Zhang for this opportunity—a debt of gratitude he would repay.

Lin Shan's interest waned as unfamiliar items appeared. Without being able to inspect them personally, his knowledge remained limited.  

But when his consigned item—the Purple Spirit Fruit seed—came up, his excitement returned.
