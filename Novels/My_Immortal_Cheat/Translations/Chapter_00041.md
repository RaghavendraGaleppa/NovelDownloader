# Chapter 41: Jiuzhou!

It was already night when the banquet ended, the brilliant moonlight casting a silvery sheen over the imperial palace.

Zhou Tian was stuffed from eating. He took the slightly dazed Tian Ling from Liu Yan’s hands and said to her, a speechless expression on his face, "Big Sis, how can Ling'er be like you? Why did you let her drink so much?"

The wine at the banquet also contained potent energy, making it difficult to digest.

Liu Yan looked embarrassed, stammering, "We were just having such a good time, got a bit carried away..." She then added loudly, "Well, wasn't it a bargain for you anyway?"

"Alright, alright, just go back already," Zhou Tian waved his hand, too lazy to argue with her. He bid farewell to Zhou Xunchuan, Zhou Zui, and the others, then helped Tian Ling into the carriage.

Zhou Zui wore a long, bitter face, looking as if he was in for a severe scolding when he got home.

Tian Ling's face was flushed crimson, reeking of alcohol, yet she could still control her body, hovering in a state between semi-drunk and semi-sober. Once inside the carriage, Zhou Tian pulled Tian Ling into his embrace, sitting her down like that. Of course, he wasn't harboring any ill intentions; he wasn't that desperate. He was merely afraid she wouldn't be able to sit steady and would fall.

Tian Ling only struggled symbolically a few times before settling motionlessly in his arms.

With Tian Ling still, Zhou Tian felt the need to move. He shifted his position, his hand resting on Tian Ling's waist, his face a picture of a perfect gentleman, eyes straight ahead...

After sitting like that for a while, Zhou Tian couldn't resist moving again. His hand stealthily, slowly, inched upwards, wildly testing the boundaries in certain areas. Just then, Tian Ling in his arms lifted her head, her eyes watery, cheeks flushed, hair disheveled. She softly asked, "Zhou Tian, do you like me?"

Looking at Tian Ling's watery eyes and soft, pink lips, how could he possibly resist?

"What do you think, silly girl!" he said, then lowered his head and kissed her.

It was cool and soft.

Tian Ling's eyes showed a hint of surprise, but moments later, she was completely immersed, closing her eyes and trying her best to respond to Zhou Tian's teasing, a tingling sensation echoing in her heart! Tian Ling's brows suddenly furrowed slightly, and she let out a soft moan, for Zhou Tian's hand was already in a place it shouldn't be.

After a long while, their lips parted, a glistening line stretching between them. Seeing Tian Ling's hazy eyes, Zhou Tian felt his engine roaring. To hell with ceremony! He couldn't *not* drive this car. If he didn't release it soon, he'd explode!

"Zhou Tian, I like you too, I really, really like you. Don't abandon me later, okay?" Tian Ling whispered in a voice as faint as a mosquito's buzz, clinging tightly to Zhou Tian, like a wounded little beast seeking solace!

Tian Ling's murmuring words were like a bucket of cold water poured over Zhou Tian's head.

Damn it, life always needs some goddamn ceremony!!!!!

Zhou Tian took a deep breath, mentally asserted control over his body, silently recited the *Three Character Classic*, and calmed down. Gently stroking Tian Ling's hair, he softly said, "Silly girl, I would abandon myself before I abandon you!"

Tian Ling's grip tightened further...

They rode in silence. By the time they reached the Prince of Qin’s estate, Tian Ling had fallen asleep in his arms. He carried her to Muxu Garden. Then he reconsidered; it seemed there was only a crusty old man inside, whose surname he'd forgotten. What if he tried to take advantage of his Ling'er? Zhou Tian never hesitated to assume the worst of others. He called over a maid, carefully instructed her to take good care of Tian Ling, and then handed her over.

He then headed towards the main hall. Zhou Yi had told him earlier that he should visit that evening; after all, his two elder brothers had arrived and they hadn't had a proper chat yet. When he arrived, Zhou Yi, Zhou Yu, and Zhou Ying were already there. Seeing him enter, Zhou Ying chuckled, "Third Brother, you finally deigned to send your fiancée back?"

"Second Brother, stop teasing me..." Zhou Tian said with a wry smile.

"The reason we asked you to come tonight," Zhou Yi interjected, "is for you to demonstrate your divine ability. Your two elder brothers have been searching for ways to cure their condition for years, so let them set their minds at ease."

"Oh," Zhou Tian said, having no objections. He casually picked a spot, his figure blurring as he instantly shifted over. It was worth noting that having accumulated two more death counts, his Teleportation's range had now extended to three hundred meters.

"Even Elder Zhan couldn't stop his divine ability!" Zhou Yi added.

"What?!" Zhou Yu exclaimed, frowning deeply.

Seeing his son's reaction, Zhou Yi knew what he was thinking. "It's already been verified by the soul lamp; he hasn't been body-snatched."

"That's good then..." Zhou Yu let out a sigh of relief. His first thought had indeed been that Zhou Tian had been possessed.

"Then Third Brother must perform well in the Youth Competition, to shock those who always thought you were a mortal..." Zhou Ying laughed heartily and continued, "What was that called again... Some worlds we've conquered seem to have a similar trope, a 'waste... waste material's comeback.' Yes, that's it!"

Worlds that have been conquered? Zhou Tian mentally noted the term and said, "I'm not participating in that thing; it's too much effort!" He absolutely refused to participate in any so-called Youth Competition. How wonderful it was to be a salted fish! He had a cheat, after all, and would eventually become invincible. Even if he did participate, although life and death were disregarded on the arena, given his status, he definitely wouldn't die on the stage. Since he couldn't accumulate death counts, what was the point of going?

"No ambition!" Zhou Yi said, exasperated.

"Nah, nah, nah..." Zhou Tian made strange noises by swirling his tongue in his mouth, greatly irritating Zhou Yi.

"Since Third Brother doesn't wish to participate, so be it. Not participating this time is fine, but you cannot miss the next Eight Provinces Grand Competition; it's a tribal regulation after all." Zhou Yu interjected.

"Hmm, I'll go next time!" Next time, he'd be furious with anyone who tried to stop him. Since it was a grand competition, no one would be protecting him. He could finally die! Here, he was protected every day and couldn't even die when he wanted to. Once a day, ten times in ten days... By the end of the competition, he'd be invincible, Zhou Tian secretly fantasized.

Zhou Yi saw that he finally had some ideological awareness this time and said nothing more.

"By the way, Big Brother, Second Brother, can you tell me where you're campaigning? And what does 'worlds that have been conquered' mean?"

"This..." Zhou Ying glanced at Zhou Yu, then at Zhou Yi, hesitating.

"There's nothing that can't be said. You'll know sooner or later anyway. Since you've asked, I'll tell you," Zhou Yu said after pondering for a moment. "To know where we campaign, you must first understand Jiuzhou very well."

Zhou Yu was a decisive person and explained directly without keeping them in suspense. "In ancient times, Jiuzhou was not nine landmasses like today's continents, but nine massive worlds. Each province was incredibly powerful, with countless experts!"
