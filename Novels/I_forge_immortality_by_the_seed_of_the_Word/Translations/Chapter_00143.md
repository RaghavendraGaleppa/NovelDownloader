# Chapter 142: The Path of World Manifestation

"Excellent!"

Yuanming Zhenjun smiled knowingly.

He then began explaining to Zhang Jing:

"The Primordial Beginning World lineage encompasses countless paths—any single one can lead to the Great Dao."

"Some, like your senior brother, use the Primordial Beginning World as a foundation to follow the path of Dao soldiers. With a wave of their hand, billions of immortal Dao soldiers can be summoned. There are even mighty ones who can instantly capture and assimilate entire worlds with but a thought."

"Others follow the ancient immortal path, refining the Primordial Beginning World into a life-bound treasure that embodies their destiny and the Great Dao, possessing extreme combat prowess. However, this path is more commonly taken by those of the Polar Light Magnetic Sea lineage. If you wish to pursue this path, you might seek guidance from them."

"Some merge with the Primordial Beginning World, forging an indestructible immortal body—'I am the world, the world is me.'"

For a time, under Yuanming Zhenjun's guidance, Zhang Jing came to understand the thousands of powerful paths within the Primordial Beginning World lineage.

Yuanming Zhenjun seemed particularly patient with this new disciple, clearly explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each path.

After what felt like an eternity, Yuanming Zhenjun concluded:

"These are the more established paths of the Primordial Beginning World lineage. Of course, there are many other experimental paths explored by disciples who study the Primordial Beginning inheritance. You can refer to them in the Dao Repository for inspiration when the time comes."

"Among all paths, the Path of World Manifestation is the most formidable, but also the most difficult to cultivate. The Dao soldier path your senior brother follows is also superior—though slightly less powerful than World Manifestation, its difficulty is significantly reduced."

"As for the ancient immortal path and the indestructible immortal body path, they are even easier to cultivate, yet their power should not be underestimated."

Yuanming Zhenjun spoke slowly, watching as Zhang Jing fell into deep contemplation. He did not disturb him, waiting patiently with a trace of curiosity.

Which path would this young man choose?

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing's mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, ideas forming and dissolving in rapid succession.

"Senior Brother Feng chose the Dao soldier path, which sounds incredibly powerful. With a wave of his hand, billions of immortal soldiers would drown the enemy. Not to mention the ability to capture entire worlds and assimilate their inhabitants as Dao soldiers, or turn them into training grounds!"

"But the indestructible immortal body sounds equally tempting!"

"The ancient immortal path is also impressive."

After much deliberation, Zhang Jing's attention settled on World Manifestation.

"Ultimately, it allows one to manifest and evolve a true world—the source of all laws, the root of all Daos, called the 'Primordial'..."

He gradually made up his mind.

No matter how he looked at it, Zhang Jing felt that only World Manifestation was truly suited to him—or more precisely, to the mysterious jade talisman.

Moreover, he had clearly heard that World Manifestation was the most powerful path.

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Jing turned to his master.

"Have you decided?" Yuanming Zhenjun asked with a smile.

"Master, I choose World Manifestation!" Zhang Jing declared resolutely.

The moment these words left his mouth, a flicker of surprise flashed through Yuanming Zhenjun's eyes.

He had anticipated many possible choices for his disciple—the Dao soldier path, the ancient immortal path, the indestructible immortal body path, the external heavens path—but never had he expected World Manifestation.

This path was far too difficult.

Yuanming Zhenjun's gaze darkened momentarily before he spoke again, his tone grave:

"Zhang Jing, are you certain? Have you considered the consequences if you fail to cultivate the Path of World Manifestation?"

"Disciple is certain."

"Very well," Yuanming Zhenjun sighed. "However, I will give you only three hundred years. If you cannot reach the Golden Core Divine Ability realm through World Manifestation within that time, do not blame me for intervening and forcing you to abandon this path to pursue another."

"Understood. Thank you, Master."

Zhang Jing bowed deeply once more.

"May fortune favor you."

With those words, Yuanming Zhenjun raised his right hand, his jade-like index finger extending forward.

In an instant, his finger traversed the void, arriving before Zhang Jing's forehead.

A chaotic-colored seal emerged from Zhang Jing's brow, actively meeting the luminous fingertip.

In that moment, countless methods and secrets of the Path of World Manifestation flooded Zhang Jing's consciousness.

Soon after, a crimson stone seal appeared in Zhang Jing's hand.

"Now go and cultivate. Your senior brother will arrange everything else. When you reach the Unity realm, you shall become my formal disciple."

"Additionally, I have granted you access to the Flowing Light Immortal Domain. Explore its uses at your leisure."

With a faint smile, Yuanming Zhenjun waved his hand, and Zhang Jing's figure vanished from the hall.

Outside the hall, the void rippled as Zhang Jing reappeared, a trace of bewilderment on his face.

"So, junior brother, which path did you choose?"

Feng Wuyu, who had been waiting, brightened upon seeing Zhang Jing and eagerly leaned in.

"Let me guess—ancient immortal, Dao soldiers, or immortal body?"

"World Manifestation."

Zhang Jing answered honestly.

Feng Wuyu's expression froze.

After a long pause, he clicked his tongue and regarded Zhang Jing with amazement.

"What were you thinking? With so many powerful paths in the Primordial Beginning World lineage, why choose the pit that is World Manifestation? Did Master give you three hundred years?"

Zhang Jing was taken aback.

"How did you know, senior brother?"

"Because I was just as arrogant in my youth," Feng Wuyu admitted sheepishly.

"Well, no matter. Since you've chosen it, you might as well try. One must attempt it to be satisfied. Our Primordial Beginning World lineage enjoys long lifespans, and Master has special methods to allow us to start over. Consider it just three hundred years lost—hardly significant."

"By the way, where's your Crimson Seal?"

Feng Wuyu asked, eyeing Zhang Jing.

"You mean this?" Zhang Jing produced the crimson stone seal, curiosity gleaming in his eyes. "What exactly is this?"

"That's it—the proof of authority to establish your own immortal island within the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven. It signifies Master's permission for you to create your own immortal abode in the realm."

With that, a bronze divine light enveloped Zhang Jing, and they instantly traversed the void.

Soon, the bronze light arrived in a vast, boundless world.

Towering emerald peaks rose from the earth, piercing the clouds, adorned with countless spirit cranes, phoenixes, and rare beasts.

Immortal radiance shimmered amidst rolling mists.

Without pause, the bronze light soared upward until countless immense floating immortal islands came into view.

It halted at a secluded location.

"How about this spot for your immortal island, junior brother?" Feng Wuyu asked.
