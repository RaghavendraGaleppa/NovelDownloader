# Chapter 247: The Nun

The last image in Pei Yan’s pupils was the bronze shards flying as the heavy mace tore through his precious armor.

His Zhou Tian Sword Bone was as brittle as glass before the eighth-grade divine weapon. It began to vaporize inch by inch from his fingertips. Boiling flesh and blood, carried by the wind of the mace, transformed into a crimson meteor shower that melted honeycomb-like holes into the lava rock ten zhang away.

*Clang!*

The Big Dipper Heavenly Pivot Armor fell from Pei Yan’s body and plunged into the magma. Xu Yunfan knelt on one knee, the gaps in his Dragon Scale Armor continuously leaking a mixture of scorching breath.

He watched the armor gradually sinking, then reached out and grabbed the precious armor.

Before he could make another move, the Dragon Scale Armor began to open and close rapidly, conveying an extremely eager emotion.

Having exited the Lin Character State, Xu Yunfan felt this anomaly in the Dragon Scale Armor and his heart stirred slightly. He stopped suppressing it.

With a thought, the Dragon Scale Armor immediately began to tremble impatiently, vibrating violently in his palm.

Countless dark gold dragon-patterned scales, like living things, opened and closed. They actually broke free from the back of his hand autonomously, transforming into a thousand strands of fine golden threads that wrapped the precious armor layer by layer.

Under the illumination of the terrestrial fire and lava, the gold-inlaid patterns of the two divine weapons merged like quicksilver. Pei Yan’s precious armor was actually crushed to pieces by the Dragon Scale Armor leaves.

“It can actually devour divine weapons of the same kind...”

His pupils contracted. He saw the Big Dipper Armor surface manifesting energy currents in an attempt to resist.

The Dragon Scale Armor burst forth with dark red blood flames from the gaps between the armor pieces. The shattered armor pieces transformed into a mercury-like liquid, converging into Xu Yunfan’s chest’s Tanzhong acupoint along the golden thread veins.

In an instant, a massive energy surged into Xu Yunfan’s body, and along with it, the Steel Forging Hundred Tempering Body automatically began to operate.

The Golden Muscle and Jade Bone phenomenon shone brilliantly, continuously refining the armor essence filtered out by the Dragon Scale Armor.

Xu Yunfan felt his five viscera and six bowels being tempered as if by terrestrial fire. The bottleneck that had been stuck at the minor success of Blood Exchange actually loosened by a fraction.

A large block of attribute panel information prompts appeared in his vision. A rough glance revealed that the proficiency of the Thousand Jun Mountain Shaking Hammer had increased.

When the last piece of armor melted away, several strands of golden light lit up on the back of the Dragon Scale Armor.

Seven silver stars traveled along the armor leaves covering the spine dragon.

Xu Yunfan shook his wrist. As the armor vibrated, it actually shot out seven star-soul sword energies, cutting a lava pillar three zhang away in half.

The eighth-grade divine weapon, the Dragon Scale Armor, seemed to have even more functions that had yet to be unleashed.

Just the ability to devour divine armor alone—if it were to spread, even the supreme Grandmasters of the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining would likely fight bloody battles to obtain it.

Xu Yunfan took one last look at the spot where Pei Yan had been blasted into slag by the heavy mace and fallen into the terrestrial fire.

Even a lion uses its full strength to catch a rabbit, let alone Pei Yan, a Walker of the Sword Pavilion. If one were slightly careless, it was very possible the other party could turn the tables.

Fortunately, fortunately, he had stepped into Blood Exchange early.

If he were still in the Flesh Refining Realm, it would have been very difficult to kill Pei Yan.

For the past few days, he had racked his mind for a long time trying to pry the Void Clearing Sword Washing Art and the Three Jiao Sword Nourishing Technique from Pei Yan’s mouth. Pei Yan had also buried several big traps for him, especially the Void Clearing Sword Washing Art. If not for the existence of the attribute panel, which displayed it as a "Completion" state in the skill column, he naturally wouldn't have been able to obtain the complete version.

Seeing the complete Void Clearing Sword Washing Art, Xu Yunfan realized that Pei Yan hadn't even recited the full outline.

How insidious his intentions were!

Suddenly, the sound of a heavy object falling came from the shadow of the rock wall.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes sharpened. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was thrown toward the source of the sound like a venomous dragon leaving its cave.

“It’s me!”

Qi Huan rolled out of his hiding place in a sorry state, the demonic blue scales having been blown off in large patches by the mace wind.

He looked at the scene with horror, seeing that only Xu Yunfan remained, with obvious traces of a battle around him. As a smart man, he instantly understood the situation before him.

He was naturally shocked by Xu Yunfan’s audacity, but he was even more terrified that Xu Yunfan was so unscrupulous, daring to kill even the Sword Pavilion, one of the top sects among the Six Major Sects.

Qi Huan didn't hesitate, dropping to his knees with a thud. “Senior Brother Xu! Qi Huan is willing to serve you as his master!”

“Senior Brother Xu...”

Xu Yunfan was speechless and amused, shaking his head slightly. He sighed, “Brother Qi, your timing is truly unfortunate. You were doing fine up there, why did you come down?”

Watching Xu Yunfan’s large hand reach out to press down, Qi Huan’s mind shattered instantly, screaming, “Maitreya Monastery, the Buddha Son of Maitreya Monastery has come looking, I had no choice but to come down.”

Xu Yunfan’s hand moved slightly, then slammed down forcefully.

“...”

Watching Qi Huan’s corpse, eyes wide in death, slowly sink into the magma, Xu Yunfan sighed, “Senior Brother Qi, I really had no choice in this matter. In the future, if I remember, I will burn some paper money for you.”

Killing the Sword Pavilion’s current Walker, if any news were to leak, would not only be a disaster for him, but also a calamity for the Heavenly Work Cave.

Pei Yan possessed a天生 Sword Bone and wore divine armor, with the Green Bamboo Sword protecting his body. As long as he didn't provoke a Grandmaster of Organ Refining, he could go anywhere.

If not for entering the Small World Secret Realm, Pei Yan would likely have had Sword Pavilion experts protecting him at all times.

This was a heaven-sent opportunity. In the outside world, where could one find such a great bargain?

If he wanted no one to know, he could only send these two on their way.

Walking out of the ground fissure and back to the surface, Xu Yunfan saw a white-robed, bald monk standing not far away.

He raised an eyebrow slightly and looked up. The white-robed monk was as slender as a lotus, with a mole like a drop of blood at the center of his brow.

Although bald, there were no tonsure scars. His entire body glowed like white jade. Strangely, when he clasped his hands together, he showed three fingers on each hand.

Six fingers?!

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred slightly. In Buddhist legends, being born with six fingers is the sign of a Buddha.

The monk’s six fingers were as smooth and slender as snow buds, with faint golden Sanskrit light flowing between the knuckles.

“Immeasurable Life Buddha.”

As the female monk softly chanted the Buddhist name, seven layers of light wheels suddenly bloomed behind her head.

Each light wheel was condensed from fine Sanskrit characters, and the six-character mantra of *Om Mani Padme Hum* could be seen faintly floating in the void.

She stepped barefoot over the scorched earth, and beneath her feet, golden lotus shadows actually emerged. The terrestrial fire and lava retreated upon contact, as if fearing this orthodox Buddhist method.

Xu Yunfan’s pupils contracted, and he blinked, as if what he had just seen was an illusion.

He instantly reacted, his heart shaken greatly.

This female monk actually cultivated a mental secret technique.

As if sensing Xu Yunfan’s gaze, a trace of surprise appeared in the female monk’s eyes.

“I didn’t expect the Benefactor to have entered the state.”

“Entered the state?”

Xu Yunfan was a bit puzzled, but he understood the other party was referring to his cultivation of the Lin Character Art. He didn't say much, just asked, “May I ask what brings the Master here?”

“To find a path to life. The Buddha told me there is vitality here.”

When the female monk spoke, her voice was like a clear chime. Her six fingers formed the Great Sun Tathagata Seal.

As her white robe moved without wind, Xu Yunfan suddenly smelled a strange fragrance. It wasn't sandalwood or musk, but rather the pure breath of a菩提 tree when its new buds just bloom.

This aroma actually caused the dormant Red Python Strength within his flesh and blood to slowly stir, and even the Dragon Scale Armor leaves, which had fallen silent after devouring the Big Dipper Armor, began to open and close.
