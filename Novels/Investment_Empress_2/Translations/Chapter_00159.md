Chapter 159: The Second Ranking is Announced, I'm Seriously Questioning My Life

Li Mo was slightly stunned.

A hole had been opened above the rockery at some point—likely the Master's doing.

Because of this, the moon of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, known for its extraordinary size, shone through.

Moonlight cascaded like a waterfall into the Mistflower Ageless Spring, making the clear pool shimmer with a dreamlike, ethereal glow.

Hmm, but what truly felt like a dream wasn't the moon, nor the pool water.

Ying Bing, her black hair tied up, soaked in the spring, her neck long and graceful.

The water was still quite warm. Combined with the fact that she had just opened her spiritual orifices through cultivation, her ice-skin and jade-bone were stained with a layer of rouge.

Her bathrobe clung to her figure. Through the shimmering ripples of the water, her form was visible yet hazy, like looking at flowers through fog.

Li Mo said nothing.

Little Li was not a man of many words.

"You returned... quite early."

Ying Bing lowered her eyes, wiping her arms with a towel.

Sometimes, people try to keep themselves busy to ease the tension—like when a teacher checks homework and you haven't brought yours...

"Ahem..."

Li Mo nodded. Despite the rising steam, he inexplicably felt his throat go dry.

"I just chased a bird and ended up chasing it all the way to Yin Huxuan. I hammered him a few times and that was it."

As his words fell, the only sound echoing in the rockery was the splashing of water.

*What the hell am I saying?*

Little Li was frantically reviewing his own words internally.

"Your hammer is quite impressive then," Ying Bing said.

"Thanks for the compliment," Li Mo replied.

"......" Ying Bing.

"......" Li Mo.

Sensing the atmosphere was getting a bit strange, Li Mo casually added, "I was exhausted just now. I was thinking that once I got back, I'd take a good soak and rest..."

"I see."

Ying Bing murmured inexplicably to herself.

She thought it over. This Mistflower Ageless Spring was originally built by Li Mo; it was his thing.

So, after going out and fighting someone dangerously, coming back to soak in the bath was a very reasonable thing to do.

"Do you want to soak together?"

The words left her mouth, and Ying Bing immediately felt it was a bit strange.

She had never invited anyone to take a bath with her before.

"Huh?"

Li Mo was a bit confused.

He didn't expect that after Ice Cube had been sitting there with a solemn expression, pondering for half a day, she would blurt out such a sentence.

"Is that... okay?"

"If you mind that the water has been soaked in by me, you can..."

"Not at all!"

Li Mo's face was filled with firm determination.

Mind?

This water shouldn't be seen by just anyone. Although the spring is self-replenishing, it can't withstand the desire of so many people to drink it...

"......"

Seeing him say so, Ying Bing turned her head to the side.

"I'm coming in."

After changing into his bathrobe, Li Mo splashed into the pool.

The water rippled.

Ying Bing caught a glimpse out of the corner of her eye. His bathrobe wasn't even tied tightly; his upper body was slightly exposed.

Strange.

When they used to dual cultivate, they often lay together at night, and it didn't feel like anything.

It's just taking a bath together...

She hadn't flinched when walking the Immortal Path in the Void.

Hmm.

Just act calm.

"Hah..."

Li Mo let out a comfortable breath, then asked curiously.

Although the pool was large, they weren't sitting far apart.

But there wasn't a trace of cold aura coming from Ice Cube. Today was the day the Taiyin Star was at its peak, yet last time she had turned the entire Autumn Water Pavilion into the dead of winter.

"Did you make another breakthrough?"

"Yes, I opened an orifice."

After this exchange, the Mistflower Ageless Spring fell silent again.

Ying Bing focused her mind.

She seized every second to observe the Taiyin, clearing her thoughts.

After all, the countdown was ticking away second by second.

Li Mo, seeing her in this state, didn't disturb her. He turned his attention to the two rewards feedback from the system.

[Congratulations, Host. You successfully invested in 'Xu Zhiqing', preventing her from getting injured.]

[Investment Feedback: Two strings of Soul-Cleansing Bodhi Fruits.]

[Congratulations, Host. You successfully invested in 'Miao Jinyin', preventing him from getting injured.]

[Investment Feedback: One canister of Spirit-Concentrating Lotus Tea.]

Both of these treasures were beneficial to the soul.

---

"Wait, why are there two items?"

"Senior Brother Ouyang probably wasn't going to get injured anyway."

It seems this Senior Brother, who is quite poor because of painting, is actually quite strong.

Li Mo took out two floating trays.

He placed the two soul treasures on them separately and pushed one out, letting the water waves carry it to Ice Cube.

Hmm?

Ice Cube is training; she's so focused.

She's so absorbed that she didn't even notice the tray approaching.

Of course, she is focused.

Because the countdown has almost reached its end.

00:00:03...

00:00:02...

00:00:01...

The countdown reached zero.

The familiar system notification sounded in his ear again.

[Listing all geniuses within the scope of the Eastern Wasteland Domain...]

[Comparing combat power...]

Ying Bing furrowed her delicate brows, staring intently.

If it were before, she wouldn't have felt even a sliver of tension.

But after all...

There was a variable last time.

She hoped that this time, everything would return to the right track.

If she got the first place reward, she might be able to share it with him, making everyone happy.

[Ding—]

[The results of the second Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Ranking are announced.]

[Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Rank 50: Yu Zhao.]

...

[Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Rank 44: Lin Jiang.]

...

[Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Rank 30: Murong Xiao.]

...

[Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Rank 10: Han Zhen.]

...

Compared to the last time, the rankings had slight changes.

The few Clear Abyss Sect disciples Li Mo knew had all moved up in rank.

But overall, the people on the list were mostly the same as before, just the order had changed.

Han Zhen had also fallen from the 4th place, almost dropping out of the top ten.

It seems this guy was indeed severely injured last time.

She remembered that in her previous life, Han Zhen first showed his face at the Cloud Province Martial Arts Summit, winning one of the top three spots.

At that time, the Hengyun Sword City suddenly had a mutation, and the treasure carrying the Hengyun Sword Mark was lost. It seems there was an inseparable connection with this person.

These are just speculations. She only heard about it at the time and didn't experience it personally.

Each of the nine peaks of the Clear Abyss Sect could only send one elite disciple to participate.

While she was thinking, the announcement of the list was nearing its end.

[Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Rank 5: Huang Donglai.]

[Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Rank 4: Zhong Zhenyue.]

[Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Rank 3: Shang Li.]

...

"Nom nom."

"You know this thing... how did it grow... such a good little taste..."

Li Mo's cheeks bulged as he chewed.

He was thinking about whether to feed some of the Soul-Cleansing Bodhi Fruits to Princess Jiang.

After all, Jiang Chulong would eventually reach the Divine Viewing Realm, so laying a foundation wouldn't hurt.

Splash—

A loud sound of water came from not far away.

Li Mo was stunned. He looked up and his pupils couldn't help but contract.

Wait.

Why is Ice Cube standing up?

Don't you know how deadly your figure is?

"What's wrong?"

He had never seen Ice Cube lose her composure like this.

Little Li immediately went on high alert.

"You..."

Ying Bing stared fixedly at the ranking that no one else could see.

[Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Rank 2: Ying Bing.]

[Eastern Wasteland Domain Genius Rank 1: Li Mo.]

Her slightly dazed eyes slowly turned to the youth not far away.

She...

Was压 (pressed) under him again?!
