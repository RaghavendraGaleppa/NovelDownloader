# Chapter 203 - I Forge Longevity with a Dao Seed

“Little Gourd Vine, grow quickly, fill Master’s stores with gourds~”

On the immortal island.

Deer Thirty-Eight, with his large head and small body, was bouncing towards the palace, his steps exceptionally light, his face revealing unconcealed joy.

He! Deer Thirty-Eight!

After working day and night, coupled with a little help from the Natural Wondrous Birth Embryonic Realm, he had finally lived up to Master’s expectations and successfully germinated the gourd seed.

Although, in Deer Thirty-Eight’s perception, it would still be a very, very long time before this gourd vine matured and bore fruit, hadn't it at least gotten off to a good start?

“If I can convince Master this time, it would be great to buy a bit more of that Aeon River Gold Dust from before.” Deer Thirty-Eight thought with longing.

That stuff was truly amazing, capable of accelerating the growth of immortal roots and spiritual plants.

And that was back when he didn't even have the divine ability of the Natural Wondrous Birth Embryonic Realm.

Now, the effect would likely be even more terrifying.

Lost in thought, Deer Thirty-Eight excitedly arrived outside the palace gates.

However, the very next moment, his expression froze, and he halted, his gaze unconsciously drifting to one side.

In that direction was Master’s cultivation chamber.

“What in the world is happening? Such astonishing temporal aura!” Deer Thirty-Eight murmured.

Master’s cultivation chamber was currently enveloped by an immensely vast power of time, clearly having transformed into an boundless ocean, churning with surging waves.

He recognized this aura. It came from the Aeon River Gold Dust.

But... how much Aeon River Gold Dust would it take to unleash such terrifying temporal power? Millions of particles, or perhaps tens of millions?

Moreover, whether it was an illusion or not, Deer Thirty-Eight felt a strangely terrifying and oppressive aura growing and expanding freely within the ocean formed by the temporal power.

Even he, who had already reached the Golden Core Realm and even condensed powerful bloodline divine abilities, felt shivers run down his spine.

“Could it be that Master is advancing to the Golden Core Realm? If so, I absolutely cannot allow anyone to disturb him!” Deer Thirty-Eight suddenly thought of a possibility, and his body trembled.

Immediately, he cast aside all thoughts of the Seven Treasures Gourd Vine.

He hurried to the palace gates, transforming into a guardian, his eyes vigilantly scanning his surroundings.

His expression had become utterly solemn.

...

Meanwhile, inside the cultivation chamber.

Zhang Jing’s eyes were tightly shut, his entire being seemingly having fallen into a peculiar state.

Between his brows, a fingernail-sized grey immortal crystal was emitting strands of chaotic and hazy radiance.

The radiance coalesced into a thick mist. The mist enveloped Zhang Jing, quietly filling the entire cultivation chamber at the same time.

A peculiar aura of temporal flux instantly spread outwards.

...

His consciousness was a混沌(chaos).

Time flowed slowly.

Zhang Jing didn't know how long he had been cultivating. It could have been ten thousand years, or even a hundred thousand! In any case, it was certainly a prolonged period.

At present, he only knew to mechanically cultivate the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability Legacy.

Day after day, year after year.

Without cease.

Yet, Zhang Jing seemed to have entered a special state, showing no trace of weariness or boredom from beginning to end. His mind was entirely immersed in the vast and boundless Dao and its principles within the divine ability legacy.

Creation, All Heavens, Void, Empowerment…

All sorts of profound meanings lingered in his mind.

They ultimately transformed into wisps of insight, appearing within Zhang Jing’s heart, gathering little by little into streams, then slowly converging into rivers, and eventually forming a boundless, surging ocean.

He didn’t know how much time had passed.

The Aeon River Gold Crystal between his brows was now covered in fine cracks.

Suddenly, with a crisp 'snap'.

The Aeon River Gold Crystal instantly shattered into countless particles, vanishing in an instant.

At the same time, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, a profound ancientness and bewilderment flashing within them. His thoughts had even become somewhat sluggish.

“Where am I?”

...

After a long while, a glimmer of clarity appeared in Zhang Jing’s eyes, and his consciousness gradually reawakened.

“Compared to the Aeon River Gold Dust, the temporal power contained within this Aeon River Gold Crystal is truly too immense,” he thought with lingering fear.

Although the recent experience felt like a grand dream to Zhang Jing, it was not a pleasant one. Spending hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years, continuously in an empty, desolate place, without moving, sleeping, or resting, dedicating all his time to cultivating and comprehending the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability—

In that dream, he hadn't felt much.

But upon waking, reflecting on it, he could vaguely sense that boundless loneliness, striking directly at the depths of his soul! It made a deep fear rise unconsciously within him.

Three hours later, Zhang Jing gradually recovered.

Right! The Twenty-Four Heavens!

It seemed to just click for him, and he suddenly jolted, his heart surging with emotion. A strong sense of anticipation crept into his eyes.

The next moment, his mind instantly focused on the mysterious jade talisman within his Niwan Palace.

Then, Zhang Jing’s eyes suddenly glazed over.

[Twenty-Four Heavens · Level 6 (4.26 million / 64 million)]
Skill Attributes: Primordial Immortal Core (Immortal), Void Crucible (Immortal)

“Just one Aeon River Gold Crystal actually directly raised the Twenty-Four Heavens skill to Level 6, and there’s even over four million experience points leftover?”

Looking at this utterly astonishing result, even though Zhang Jing had some mental preparation beforehand, when this scene truly appeared before him, he still felt a sense of unreality.

The cultivation chamber was silent.

After a long silence.

“Phew—, as expected of a precious treasure worth one hundred and twenty million; its effect is simply terrifying.” Zhang Jing smacked his lips.

Even now, he was still a little dazed.

Regaining his composure, his divine sense directly landed on the mysterious jade talisman.

Immediately, a flash of realization crossed Zhang Jing’s eyes.

“The Twenty-Four Heavens skill, from initial comprehension to its current Level 6, requires a total of nearly forty-three million seven hundred and forty thousand experience points. This means that the single Aeon River Gold Crystal just now directly gave me nearly forty-eight million experience points.” He mused.

This effectively meant that he could gain one skill experience point for less than three Qi Luck points.

This was significantly more cost-effective than using Aeon River Gold Dust.

The key was the time saved. If he had to use Aeon River Gold Dust particle by particle for so much experience... Zhang Jing couldn’t even imagine that scenario.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but glance at the jade talisman again.

To upgrade the Twenty-Four Heavens skill from Level 6 to Level 7 required sixty-four million experience points. Beyond that were Level 7 to Level 8, Level 8 to Level 9, and Level 9 to Level 10.

“I still have a full three point nine billion Qi Luck. That should be enough to upgrade it into an Immortal Seed, right?” Zhang Jing thought with some uncertainty.

As he pondered, the mysterious jade talisman shimmered slightly.

Immediately after, two pieces of information appeared directly in Zhang Jing’s mind, which were the explanations for the two newly appeared skill attributes.

Primordial Immortal Core: Core of All Origins, drawing in all spirits and myriad elements, transforming them into pure Primordial Qi.

Void Crucible: Melting the void, to transform it into immortal essence.
