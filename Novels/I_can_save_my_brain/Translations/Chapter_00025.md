# Chapter 25: Family Authority  

Three days later, in a tavern within the rogue cultivators' market.  

"Friend Wei, we are deeply grateful for your assistance in purchasing the shop. The Chen family will not forget your kindness."  

"Thank you for your help, Senior."  

Chen Xianhe and Chen Daoxuan raised their cups and toasted Wei Sihai with smiles.  

"Not at all, not at all! We're all friends here—just a small matter, really!" Wei Sihai quickly raised his cup in return, chuckling.  

In the three days that had passed, the "minor incident" of the merfolk attacking Guang'an Prefecture had already been resolved. The topics of discussion in the rogue cultivators' market gradually shifted from the conflict to gossip about the Sword Immortal of Guang'an, Zhou Mubai.  

As the wine flowed freely, the atmosphere at the table grew livelier.  

Slightly tipsy, Chen Xianhe couldn't help but sigh, "Land in Guang'an Prefecture's Immortal City is truly worth its weight in gold! Who would have thought even shops in the rogue cultivators' market would be so expensive?"  

"Indeed!" Wei Sihai nodded emphatically. Having spent the longest time in the rogue cultivators' market, he had the deepest understanding of this.  

"Actually, the shops in the rogue cultivators' market aren't too bad. A medium-sized storefront costs at most a thousand spirit stones. The truly outrageous prices are in the core commercial district."  

At the mention of the exorbitant prices in the core commercial district, Wei Sihai shook his head.  

Hearing this, Chen Daoxuan asked nonchalantly, "Are the shops in the core commercial district really that expensive?"  

"Expensive?" Wei Sihai laughed. "That word alone doesn't do justice to them. While the market price is only ten times that of shops in the rogue cultivators' market, the reality is that money alone can't buy them. They're all controlled by major cultivation families like the Zhou, Yang, and Wu clans. For ordinary cultivators and minor families, breaking into that market is as difficult as ascending to the heavens."  

Perhaps having drunk a bit too much, Wei Sihai grew increasingly talkative. His deep-seated resentment toward the major cultivation families spilled out as he vented to Chen Daoxuan and his uncle.  

"Take this tavern we're in right now—it's owned by the Wu family, one of the major cultivation clans. In the rogue cultivators' market, over ninety percent of the taverns, inns, brokerages, and shops are controlled by these families. In the core commercial district, that number rises to a staggering one hundred percent. We rogue cultivators and minor family members make up the majority, yet we receive the least. How unjust is that?"  

By the end, Wei Sihai slammed his cup onto the table in frustration.  

Silence fell over the group.  

After a long pause, Chen Xianhe murmured, "Brother Wei, you're drunk."  

Hearing this, Wei Sihai broke out in a cold sweat, his drunkenness dissipating by seventy or eighty percent. Openly criticizing the major cultivation families here was far from wise.  

Though nearly all rogue cultivators harbored grievances against these families, none dared to voice them openly. Those who did had all vanished without a trace.  

Seeing the awkward atmosphere, Chen Daoxuan quickly steered the conversation elsewhere.  

Half an hour later, the banquet ended as night fell.  

Chen Daoxuan and his thirteenth uncle, Chen Xianhe, walked back to their inn side by side in silence.  

Upon returning, just as Chen Daoxuan was about to begin his cultivation, Chen Xianhe knocked on his door.  

"Thirteenth Uncle, is something the matter at this hour?"  

"Yes, let's talk inside."  

Chen Daoxuan gestured for him to enter. Once inside, he carefully set up a soundproofing barrier.  

"Daoxuan, now that the shop matter is settled, I'll be staying there to oversee operations. The family affairs will be left to you."  

As he spoke, Chen Xianhe's expression was complicated. Chen Daoxuan's growth had far exceeded his expectations—not just in personal strength but also in his skills as an artificer.  

Over the past few days, Chen Xianhe had come to realize that Chen Daoxuan was not a low-tier first-rank artificer as he had claimed, but a high-tier one. Though he didn't understand why his nephew had concealed his true abilities, from another perspective, the fact that Chen Daoxuan, at just sixteen, understood the principle of "tall trees catch much wind" showed he was far more mature than expected.  

With this in mind, Chen Xianhe felt slightly more at ease about handing over the family's authority to him.  

With that, Chen Xianhe took out a black seal from his storage bag. The seal radiated a strong spiritual aura—it was a high-tier first-rank artifact.  

"This is the Chen family's patriarch seal. I entrust it to you now."  

Chen Xianhe solemnly handed the seal to Chen Daoxuan.  

"Understood."  

Chen Daoxuan accepted the seal with a grave nod.  

After settling this matter, Chen Xianhe asked, "By the way, how are the preparations for procuring supplies?"  

"Everything is ready. Once we load the ship tomorrow, we can return to Twin Lakes Island. This time, we withdrew 8,743 spirit stones from the family treasury. I spent 100 on a Water Spirit Pearl for personal use, 500 on a crafting manual for Wind-Thunder Array Disc artifacts, 1,000 on the shop, and 6,721 on various supplies. That leaves 422 spirit stones in hand."  

Chen Daoxuan smiled wryly. "That's all the family has left."  

Hearing that this trip had nearly depleted the family's three centuries of savings, Chen Xianhe couldn't help but feel a pang of regret, despite having mentally prepared himself.  

Seeing his uncle's expression darken, Chen Daoxuan quickly reassured him, "Thirteenth Uncle, these are necessary expenses for the family's growth. Besides, we'll earn it back tenfold—no, a hundredfold—in the future!"  

Chen Xianhe sighed. "Let's hope so."  

As if remembering something, he took out a jade vial from his storage bag. "Here, I bought this for you in the core commercial district the other day. Take it."  

Curious, Chen Daoxuan accepted the vial and opened it. A rich medicinal fragrance wafted out, prompting him to quickly reseal it.  

"Qi-Gathering Pills!"  

They were mid-tier first-rank spirit pills that aided Qi Refinement cultivators in their practice. From what Chen Daoxuan knew, a single Qi-Gathering Pill cost 50 spirit stones—nearly the price of a low-tier first-rank artifact. And yet, the vial contained a full ten pills!  

"Daoxuan, back then, the family could have afforded to buy you a Meridian-Cleansing Pill, but I didn't. Have you ever resented me for that?"  

"Why would you say that, Thirteenth Uncle? I've never thought that way! A Meridian-Cleansing Pill costs 500 spirit stones. If I were in your position, with the family struggling to make ends meet, I wouldn't have spent such a fortune on a junior either."  

Chen Xianhe shook his head. "But do you know what I realized the other day when I saw you wield the perfected *Gale-Chasing Sword Art*? I regretted it. Five hundred spirit stones may be a lot, but I delayed the progress of a genius in our family by five years!"  

Chen Daoxuan didn't know how to respond.  

"Daoxuan, I can see that your future path will take you further than mine, further than any ancestor of the Chen family. But I have one request for you."  

Chen Xianhe's eyes reddened as he looked at Chen Daoxuan.  

"Whatever you ask, Thirteenth Uncle."  

"No matter what happens in the future, never abandon the family. This is your roots."  

Hearing this plea, an indescribable emotion overwhelmed Chen Daoxuan. His heart ached, and his eyes stung.  

With reddened eyes, he nodded firmly. "No matter what the future holds, I will never abandon the family!"  

"Good... very good..."  

A satisfied smile spread across Chen Xianhe's face.
