# Chapter 434: The Cause Is Found, It Seems He Isn't Completely Done For...

"Ice Cube..."

Little Li suddenly felt his nose tingle with a hint of sourness.

It seemed that in Autumn Water Pavilion, there was still one reliable person.

He lifted his foot, originally intending to jog over, but after a moment's thought, he walked over with difficulty and slowness instead. He sat heavily at the table, letting out a sigh of relief as he relaxed his body, as if he had just set down a burden weighing a thousand pounds.

"Eh? This kid was walking briskly just a moment ago, what's going on now?"

"Has his condition worsened?"

Shang Wu and Qin Yuzhi looked somewhat embarrassed.

They had thought Li Mo wasn't that seriously ill; they regretted teasing him now.

"Let's take his temperature first."

Ying Bing unscrewed the big-headed doll and took out a bronze item with tiny holes, resembling a feather shaft without the feathers.

It was a small trophy she had obtained while slaying demons in the Southern Frontier.

As soon as Li Mo held it, it began to freeze over, turning into an ice feather.

This indicated his body temperature was very low.

"Put it in your mouth." Ying Bing instructed him to open his mouth.

Li Mo complied, and instantly, the feather turned red again, the bronze shaft even emitting flames.

This indicated his body temperature was very high.

"Doesn't that mean he's experiencing 'two extremes of ice and fire'?" Shang Wu blinked.

"Eat what,补(tonify) what..." Qin Yuzhi slapped her forehead. "You secretly ate the Snow Spirit Ginseng yesterday, didn't you!"

"....."

Ignoring them, Li Mo glanced sideways at the Ice Cube's expression.

"How do you feel right now?" Ying Bing asked, lowering her eyes.

"I... I'm fine."

The Divine Hammer Little Tyrant, whose physical body rivaled that of a disaster beast, Li Mo put on a 'weak' smile. "Perhaps it's just a minor deviation in my cultivation. I know my own body best."

"Wuu wuu, my precious disciple, don't you have anything happen to you!" Shang Wu grew anxious.

Qin Yuzhi raised a finger and finally said something sensible:

"Given his current condition, he has excess internal fire, yet his exterior is frozen. Treating the illness requires addressing it from the inside out, so we should deal with the Yang energy first?"

"But what should we do..." She blinked, looking at the Ice Cube.

Li Mo widened his eyes slightly. What was wrong with Qin Yuzhi? How did she suddenly become so... perceptive? Oh, no, so intuitive?

She's really going all out.

Naturally, the first Golden Statue Award Best Actor wouldn't fall behind.

Li Mo shook his head and sighed. "Maybe if I sleep for a bit, I'll get better on my own."

"?"

Ying Bing's face remained expressionless. She condensed a bit of internal energy at her fingertips, intending to flow it into his acupoints to cycle around and figure out the specific situation.

But before her slender hand could touch him, it was caught in Li Mo's palm.

Little Li seemed very exhausted, his gaze dimming slightly.

"Just in case... I'm saying just in case, if something really happens, help me take care of Hammer Bao. I promised it I would find it a beautiful little friend..."

"Master, drink some 'Scorching Blade' liquor. Whenever I'm sick, a good drink fixes it."

Shang Wu hurriedly poured another cup of alcohol.

Giving strong liquor to a patient? And 'fixing it' with a drink? Well, considering it's the Master, this operation seems quite reasonable...

"Cough! Cough!"

Who knew that as soon as Li Mo took a sip, he started coughing.

The liquor sprayed onto the ground, freezing into frost first, and then... it actually ignited!

What kind of combustible ice is this?!

To be honest.

The Best Actor of the Golden Statue Award performed below standard this time, slightly exaggerated, and seemed a bit guilty.

It wasn't even as convincing as some toddlers pretending to be sick to skip school.

But there is a saying: *Concern leads to confusion.*

"Let Xiao Yue play with it..."

The Ice Cube suspected that Little Li was most likely pretending. After all, he had a previous record in the Southern Frontier, tricking her into feeding him for three days.

But seeing him looking so listless, Ying Bing's clear, deep eyes couldn't help but tremble slightly.

---

*What if it's real?*

After all, he goes into the fire vein to forge iron every day, and he's wearing that Pure Yang robe (because it won't burn).

Even a Neijing Realm cultivator would find it hard to bear without protective measures...

"What are you... acting out here?"

Xue Jing stepped into the courtyard carrying a medical kit, looking at Autumn Water Pavilion which looked like an ICU ward, a small question mark appearing above his head.

Old Xue turned back to look at Elder Hanhe and Elder Zeng, asking:

"What's the situation here?"

Elder Zeng was stunned. "Huh? We carried him to Autumn Water Pavilion, and it was already like this."

Elder Hanhe also nodded. "His condition doesn't seem to have worsened..."

"Old Xue, you're finally here! Quick, come take a look at him."

Shang Wu hurriedly made way.

Li Mo: *!*

Damn it, the reliable one has arrived.

Elders Hanhe and Zeng, you two didn't run away, you went to Dan Ding Peak to get backup?

Do you have to be this reliable?!

"Hmm... these symptoms... quite strange."

Xue Jing frowned. After observing, listening, asking, and palpating, he let out a soft exclamation:

"Logically speaking, his Yang energy is so vigorous now, his exterior shouldn't be freezing. How can he be cold on the outside but hot on the inside..."

"Oh, you mean that? I almost forgot."

Elder Zeng slapped his forehead, as if remembering something.

He reached into Little Li's pocket and pulled out a chunk of icy-cold ore, which had rings of patterns on it, ten rings in total.

Xue Jing was taken aback. "Thousand-Year Frost Silver Ore? What are you two doing putting this thing on him?"

This is a stone from the bottom of the cold pool deep in the fire vein, where extreme Yang gives birth to Yin. It is also a rare material for forging weapons. It's found inside the Sky Frost Sword, and its counterpart is the Crimson Fire Copper Ore.

"This kid is scalding hot!"

Elder Hanhe extended his hand grumpily, his palm slightly reddened. "Carrying him even burned my hands red, so I had to cool him down."

".....So his 'cold exterior' came from this... huh?"

The reason Li Mo was freezing was found.

It was physical cooling.

The vast Autumn Water Pavilion suddenly fell into silence.

The withered leaves of the banyan tree rustled in the cold wind. A cold crow,不知 from where, flew past in the air, making a harsh, grating cry, as if mocking someone...

The atmosphere was extremely awkward for a moment.

"So that's how it is... I'm fine... haha, I told you..."

Without the Frost Silver Ore suppressing him, Li Mo's body began to heat up and scorch again due to the abundant Yang energy.

But why did he inexplicably feel a bit cold again?

He turned his head stiffly and saw the Ice Cube's fair, jade-like face, expressionless and looking very... *nuclear* and kind. Not cheerful at all.

"You're fine, that's good."

After saying this softly, Ying Bing turned and went upstairs.

"I'm done for..."

Little Li muttered to himself. It seemed he wasn't completely out of the woods...

Old Xue quickly wrote a prescription to reduce internal fire. "Ah, let me prescribe some medicine for you. You've had excess fire energy recently, and you've been eating too well. You need to reduce the fire, then rest properly for a few days, got it?"

"Okay, I still have a weapon to forge, I need to go."

"Then rest for two days," Elder Hanhe and Elder Zeng also said.

"Thank you, elders."

"It's nothing, no need to be polite."

The two old men left the scene of the accident.

"Hmph." Even though Shang Wu wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, she knew her disciple was pretending just now. She snorted and went back to her room.

"Ah." Qin Yuzhi shook her head as she looked at him. The young man crashed.

In the end, only Little Li remained petrified on the spot, lonely and desolate.

He couldn't help but think of a song in his heart.

*"Snowflakes fluttering~ The north wind whistles~~"*
