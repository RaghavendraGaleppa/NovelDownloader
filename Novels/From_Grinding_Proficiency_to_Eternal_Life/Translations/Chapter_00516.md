# Chapter 516: I Seek the Golden Core Dao Fruit

The newcomer wore a khaki-colored Daoist robe. His figure was not particularly tall, slightly stocky even, yet as he stood there, he gave off a sense of stability like a mountain, as if he had merged with the very earth and mountain ranges, exuding a heavy, grounded aura.

His eyes blazed like a hawk's as he swept his gaze over Xu Yunfan, lingering for a moment on the several jade bottles before him that were currently being nourished by Primordial Turbid Qi, their surfaces shimmering with a faint light. Then, his eyes shifted to Xu Yunfan himself, a look of undisguised surprise flashing within them.

"Junior Brother Xu?"

"Excellent skill. To be able to collect such a thick source of Primordial Turbid Qi so quickly. The turbid煞 rising from the deep veins of Coldcrow Pass truly has a fated connection with you. However..."

His tone paused slightly, carrying a hint of inquiry. "According to what I know, Junior Brother Xu, your cultivation path is no longer that of the *True武 Subduing Demons Sutra*, is it?"

The newcomer was none other than the Hundred Peaks True Person, Chu Chengnan!

"Senior Brother Chu?"

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised, but he wasn't too worried. Although the other party was a Great True Person at the Foundation Establishment perfection realm, he was no longer made of mud.

Furthermore, the Primordial Origin Sect valued profit over righteousness, but Xu Yunfan hadn't caused any damage to them.

Chu Chengnan had no reason to make a move against him.

Moreover, Chu Chengnan's sudden appearance at Coldcrow Pass definitely meant he had a request.

"By chance, I gained some enlightenment. With the help of a noble figure, I now cultivate the *Mystic Thunder Nine Palaces Celestial Vault Indestructible Sutra*. How can it compare to Senior Brother's *Hundred Peaks Subduing Demons Sutra*, which is profound and mysterious, capable of controlling the power of ten thousand mountains? This junior's meager cultivation is not worth Senior Brother's attention."

As he spoke, he tried to nonchalantly withdraw the jade bottles that were still absorbing the turbid qi.

Even if this Primordial Clear and Turbid Qi was needed by True Lord Qingyuan, he could still secretly keep a considerable amount for himself. Such cultivation resources were naturally the more, the better. Whether it was refining the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi or cultivating the *Mystic Thunder Nine Palaces Celestial Vault Indestructible Sutra*, it was a rare treasure.

"*Mystic Thunder Nine Palaces Celestial Vault Indestructible Sutra*?"

Chu Chengnan was stunned, his expression turning slightly strange.

"*Mystic Thunder Nine Palaces Celestial Vault Indestructible Sutra*? This... I recall this is the signature true art of the Mystic Thunder Nine Palaces True Lord. Legend has it that during the earth-shattering battle a thousand years ago, he was slain in one sword strike by the Pure Yang True Lord of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, his true spirit Dao fruit severed, and he fell completely into the sea of suffering in the cycle of reincarnation. This true sutra was lost with him, disappearing without a trace. Junior Brother Xu, your opportunity... is truly extraordinary."

Seeing that the other party had recognized the origin of the art, Xu Yunfan's expression didn't change much. Since the other party had pointed it out, he might as well be open about it.

After all, he never intended to hide it. Once he operated the Mystic Thunder power, his physical body would be covered in golden lightning arcs, and the offensive techniques within the true sutra involved channeling the thunder of heaven and earth. He would be recognized the moment he made a move.

Given that, it was better to be honest from the start.

Besides, with the Pure Yang True Lord as his backer, if True Lord Qingyuan wanted to use the *True武 Subduing Demons Sutra* to seek the Dao fruit nurtured in the Divine Martial World, he could only ask the Bodhi Pure Land for it.

Xu Yunfan was completely unaware of the situation. And if he were to be punished for it, True Lord Qingyuan would have to sleep with one eye open for the rest of his life, fearing that one day a traceless sword intent would strike and slice him to death.

The Pure Yang Ancestor's battle record was there for all to see; he was an absolute big shot.

Moreover, Xu Yunfan understood the ethos of the Primordial Origin Sect. They were all disciples of the same sect, and internal strife and selfishness were the norm.

As long as the利益 was sufficient and it didn't directly infringe upon the fundamental interests of the higher-ups—especially the True Lord Qingyuan he had now sided with—or if True Lord Qingyuan hadn't explicitly issued a decree to punish him for this "collusion," a shrewd veteran True Person like Chu Chengnan would never proactively expose the matter. It would bring him no benefit and might even unnecessarily offend a fellow disciple with limitless potential who was also a "connection."

A disciple favored by a Golden Core True Lord, regardless of whether that True Lord was from the Primordial Origin Sect, had to be handled with care.

A Foundation Establishment True Person, it sounded nice to say they had transcended the mortal coil, but in the end, if they died, they were just dead.

"Senior Brother Chu has a keen eye."

Xu Yunfan nodded, a look of just the right amount of "luck" and "frankness" on his face.

"At present, I am indeed cultivating that true sutra."

"The True Lord of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, whom we call the Pure Yang Ancestor, is also from the Divine Martial World. He was an ancestral master from the Dao Sect I joined in my mortal life. After he, the venerable one, slew the Mystic Thunder Nine Palaces True Lord, he considered me a junior of the Dao Sect and saw that I had some talent and bone structure. He casually bestowed this fragment upon me, saying it was a use for a discarded item and that it could also continue the lineage of this world's Dao, forming a good connection. This junior merely happened to be in the right place at the right time, receiving the favor of the Ancestor."

He deliberately mentioned the Divine Martial World and the Pure Yang Ancestor's bestowal to borrow their influence.

At this point, Xu Yunfan also sighed and explained, "That *True武 Subduing Demons Sutra* was already chosen by the Bodhi Pure Land.当初 at Coldcrow Pass, a bald donkey told me I had a great Buddhist affinity. If I hadn't been saved by the Pure Yang Ancestor, the role of that monkey jumping around in the Eastern Wasteland right now would have been mine."

Some things had to be made clear. Otherwise, if the other party wasn't sensible, Xu Yunfan would have no choice but to pull out a Golden Core sword qi.

As expected, upon hearing this, the surprise on Chu Chengnan's face slowly faded, replaced by a look of understanding and an indescribable sense of amusement.

He gave Xu Yunfan a deep look, seemingly wanting to挖掘 more from his calm expression, but in the end, he only nodded slightly and didn't dwell on the matter.

Who among the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect doesn't have some secrets or background?

A sliver of "good fortune" from a being like the Pure Yang True Lord was enough to make even True Lord Qingyuan think twice. There was no need to get hung up on this "past affair."

There were other ways to obtain the fruit of the Divine Martial World besides cultivating the *True武 Subduing Demons Sutra*, so there was no point in obsessing over it.

"So that's how it is. Junior Brother Xu's blessed fortune is truly enviable."

Chu Chengnan threw out a light compliment and smoothly steered the conversation back to the main point, the amusement on his face quickly replaced by a hint of gravity and anticipation.

"Let's cut the chatter. Junior Brother Xu, I have not come to you this time to reminisce, but to ask for your help. This matter concerns life and death on my path of cultivation."

Seeing how solemn Chu Chengnan was, Xu Yunfan's heart tightened, and the speed at which he controlled the jade bottles to absorb the Clear and Turbid Qi slowed.

"Please speak, Senior Brother."

Chu Chengnan took a deep breath, a strong desire and confidence bursting from his eyes.

"I need Junior Brother Xu's help to seek the Golden Core fruit."

A Golden Core Dao Fruit?!

Xu Yunfan's heart shook violently. He had never imagined that Chu Chengnan would seek to form a Golden Core at this critical juncture.

As a Great True Person, Chu Chengnan was already at the Foundation Establishment perfection realm. The inner world he had condensed was vast, giving him the confidence to seek the Golden Core Dao Fruit.

Seeing Xu Yunfan momentarily speechless, Chu Chengnan paused and clearly stated his foundation.

"The sutra I cultivate is the *Hundred Peaks Subduing Demons Sutra*. I use the mountains as my soul and the earth as my bones, condensing the Thousand Mountains and Ten Thousand Peaks Art as my Foundation Establishment. I seek the 'Immovable Mystic Peak' Dao fruit, which shares the same origin and coexists with the mountain ranges and earth veins. This fruit is of the Golden Core rank!"

Even though Xu Yunfan's will was far tougher than the average person's, his pupils couldn't help but contract sharply at this moment.
