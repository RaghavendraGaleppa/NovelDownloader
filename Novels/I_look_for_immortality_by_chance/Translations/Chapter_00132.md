# Chapter 132: Life and Death on Both Sides, Spiritual Fire Takes Form!

"Haha, the turtle's grandson has come out!"

"Hmph! A mere beast dares to mimic human speech!"

With mutual curses, the man and the demon immediately engaged in battle.

The ox demon, with its thick hide and immense strength, wielded a jade axe with terrifying power, each strike carrying the force of hundreds of thousands of pounds, unstoppable in its might.

But Ji Fenghua opened his mouth and spat out a dazzling sword seal, which shot like lightning toward the ox demon's brow.

This sword strike was as fleeting as a meteor, impossibly fast—a single, lethal blow, true to the style of a swordsman. Though the ox demon was strong, it was clumsy compared to the swordsman's techniques. Unable to dodge in time, it was struck squarely in the brow by the sword light.

"Clang!"

Yet, a white pearl atop the ox demon's head suddenly floated up, emitting a faint glow that formed an invisible force field, freezing the sword seal in place.

Seeing this, the ox demon grinned and leaped forward, swinging its axe at Ji Fenghua.

But Ji Fenghua only sneered.

"Hold!"

With a light shout, a jade token at his waist shot up, transforming into a white ribbon that coiled around the ox demon like a dragon, binding it tightly.

Then the sword seal, frozen by the white pearl, suddenly split, giving birth to a new sword light that flashed toward the ox demon's brow in an instant.

"Thud!"

The ox demon didn't even have time to scream before its head was pierced, and it collapsed, lifeless.

"Furred and horned creatures, born from dampness and eggs—how could they ever contend with the true methods of the Profound Gate?"

Victorious, Ji Fenghua's aura surged, and he couldn't help but sneer.

With a sweep of his sleeve, he collected the ox demon's corpse, the white pearl, and the jade axe.

The white pearl was clearly a natural treasure of heaven and earth, crudely refined by the ox demon. Yet it had managed to immobilize his sword seal. If properly refined with secret techniques, it could become a protective spiritual treasure.

This battle had been highly profitable.

"Boom!"

At that moment, black demonic energy surged from the great river, forming a massive hand that seemed intent on crushing Ji Fenghua in its fury. But a cold snort came from the Flying Smoke Dharma Ship, and a brilliant sword light instantly pierced through the giant hand.

Ji Fenghua smirked and prepared to retreat.

But just then, another figure emerged from the formation beneath the river—a burly man with silver horns, wielding a great axe, his eyes gleaming with green light.

"You there, human! Don't get too cocky! Dare to face me? I'll make sure you never return!"

The silver-horned man's voice boomed like thunder as he challenged Ji Fenghua.

Having just won a battle and reaped great rewards, Ji Fenghua had no intention of engaging in another fight. But when his eyes met the silver-horned man's, an inexplicable surge of pride and excitement rose in his heart.

"Why wouldn't I dare?!" Ji Fenghua shouted back, then turned and charged toward the silver-horned man.

"Not good!"

On the dharma ship, Yin Xingchao sensed trouble and wanted to warn Ji Fenghua, but the Earth Fiend Water-Sky Formation over the great river churned violently, seemingly blocking all spiritual senses.

With a sigh, Yin Xingchao fell silent.

Once outside the ship and the formation, life and death depended solely on oneself.

Even he couldn't protect them now.

Sending someone to rescue Ji Fenghua would be too late.

Such was the peril of battlefield challenges. Yet he couldn't help but feel anger—the demons weren't fools. That ox demon had clearly been bait, a sacrificial pawn to lure out a stronger opponent.

Trading life for life—how ruthless these blood-drinking savages were!

Meanwhile, Ji Fenghua, unaware of the danger, felt invincible, his heart brimming with arrogance.

His sword light split into multiple streaks, striking toward the silver-horned man like lightning as he roared, "You insignificant beast! How dare you act so brazenly!"

But the silver-horned man only sneered and swung his great axe. His energy surged endlessly, his strength like that of a titan, cleaving downward with devastating force.

"Boom!"

Though the sword seal was swift, it couldn't withstand such power. With a mournful hum, it fell back into Ji Fenghua's dantian.

Ji Fenghua's expression changed as if he had suddenly snapped out of his excitement. He slapped his jade token, trying to bind the silver-horned man while retreating hastily.

"Ha!"

But the silver-horned man let out a deafening shout, and an invisible wave of sound rolled forth, carrying a terrifying soul-shaking force.

Ji Fenghua shuddered, his eyes glazing over as he froze in place.

"Thud!"

The silver-horned man's great axe descended, cleaving him in two.

"Hahaha! Human cultivators are nothing! Leave this river at once, and I might spare your lives!"

Having slain his foe, the silver-horned man laughed triumphantly, taunting the Flying Smoke Dharma Ship.

On the ship, the Foundation Establishment cultivators had been cheering Ji Fenghua's victory moments ago. But in the blink of an eye, the situation had reversed, and Ji Fenghua lay dead.

The sight sent chills down their spines, and some even broke into cold sweat, their courage wavering.

A Foundation Establishment cultivator—gone just like that? With so much life ahead of him?

Some began to consider retreat.

Sensing this, Yin Xingchao barked, "Have you grown so soft from peaceful times that a single challenge shakes your resolve?!"

"No wonder each generation grows weaker, always overshadowed by the Falling Clouds Sect!"

"Without determination, how can you hope to achieve the Great Dao?"

He suddenly understood why the Dao Academy was so eager to conquer the Scarlet Moon Great River. Stagnant waters could never nurture a true dragon.

Too long in peace, they had grown selfish and scheming. The death of a single Foundation Establishment cultivator had them ready to flee.

What a useless bunch.

No wonder a single Flowing Clouds Banquet had allowed a mere commoner to claim nine spiritual energies.

At this thought, he instinctively glanced at Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan sensed the gaze and looked up, but Yin Xingchao had already turned away.

"Senior Brother Yin, I volunteer to leave the ship and slay that wretch to avenge Junior Brother Ji!"

From the Su family's seats, a tall, handsome youth stood and bowed to Yin Xingchao.

"Senior Brother Gu, this is Su Jingming, uncle to Su Huazheng. He reached Foundation Establishment twenty-seven years ago and has been at the early stage for nearly thirty years. He has many techniques and is just a step away from mid-stage—one of the most powerful among us."

As soon as the man stood, Ma Wu whispered to Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan nodded, glancing at the man dismissively.

Since his own breakthrough, he had studied the academy's Foundation Establishment cultivators.

And from this, he had realized who his true rivals for the position of True Disciple were.

His real opponents weren't on this ship—they were on the other two dharma ships.

Those who had secured spots in the Flowing Clouds Banquet thirty years ago were his true rivals.

Those men and women, blessed with talent and backing, had mostly reached mid-stage Foundation Establishment in thirty years, with some even at late-stage. They were the backbone of this campaign.

Compared to them, Gu Yuan and his peers were merely newcomers, fortunate to have seized the opportunities presented by the fall of the True Dragon and the campaign against the Scarlet Moon Great River to break through.

In terms of skill, they were far behind.

Only those who advanced swiftly in the next decade could hope to challenge them. Otherwise, in terms of cultivation alone, these veterans would crush them.

Su Jingming, stuck at early-stage Foundation Establishment for nearly thirty years, clearly lacked talent and fortune.

And now, his impulsive challenge showed he lacked foresight and wisdom.

Sure enough, Yin Xingchao immediately rejected him:

"Why would the demons accept a challenge now?"

"This is just their ploy to trade lives for lives, hoping to weaken our formation's seventy-seven nodes and delay our breakthrough."

"The demons of Nanbo have limited heritage. In a fair fight, they'd lose. That's why they resort to such tactics. If you leave the ship now, they won't answer, no matter how much you shout."

As if to confirm his words, the silver-horned man laughed and retreated into the formation, vanishing from sight.

The cultivators on the ship slumped in disappointment.

"Senior Brother, what now? Can we not break this formation?" Su Jingming pressed, undeterred.

"Do you think mere demons can comprehend the profound methods of the Profound Gate?"

"To think they can thwart our dharma ship's formation so easily is pure delusion."

Yin Xingchao smiled faintly and flicked his sleeve, releasing a palm-sized flame.

The flame seemed almost sentient, dancing around the ship like a playful child.

"Get in position!" Yin Xingchao snapped.

The flame dimmed slightly, as if reluctant, but obediently settled onto the spiritual node Ji Fenghua had occupied.

A tiny tendril of fire extended, brushing over the node as if sensing something.

Then the flame swelled to human height, its flickering form gradually taking on a human shape—one that bore a striking resemblance to Ji Fenghua.

Pleased with itself, the flame patted its limbs and sat cross-legged on the node, pretending to meditate.

But it soon grew restless, eyeing the hair and robes of nearby cultivators as if tempted to set them ablaze.

A sharp glance from Yin Xingchao made it think better of the idea.

The entire spectacle left the ship's occupants spellbound.

With the flame now occupying Ji Fenghua's node, the dharma ship's formation was complete once more, its radiance restored.

"To not reciprocate would be discourteous. They've slain one of ours—we cannot let this stand."

"Who among you has the courage to leave the ship and fight?"
