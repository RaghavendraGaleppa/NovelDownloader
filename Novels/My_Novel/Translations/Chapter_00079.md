# Chapter 79: Dry-Roasted Tiger Meat, A Satisfying Feast

At the village entrance stood a massive stone, about two zhang tall, carved with the characters "Black River Village." The calligraphy was bold and flowing, far too elegant for a rural backwater.

"Uncle Fu!"

"We're back!"

A burly man shouted at the top of his lungs.

Soon after, an old man pushed open his door and glanced over. His soul trembled with fright at the sight. He quickly called out to the village, "Hurry, hurry! Grab your weapons! A great tiger is here!"

A commotion erupted.

Dozens of men, armed with iron rakes, wooden clubs, and nets, gathered with tense expressions and walked over together.

Only when they got closer did they see clearly—it wasn't a great tiger at all, but a youth carrying one on his shoulder.

"The guard..."

"The Madam has sent another guard!"

Uncle Fu was overjoyed, and the surrounding people all cheered.

This Uncle Fu, named Fu Changshou, was the chief of Black River Village. At seventy-seven years old, he was considered a long-lived man.

After a brief introduction and exchange of names, Uncle Fu said, "Guard, sir, please follow me. I'll arrange a place for you to stay."

They walked along a small country path, the snow on the ground having been swept away. After a short while, Uncle Fu asked curiously, "Sir, carrying that great tiger must be tiring. Shall I have someone help you?"

"No need," Li Xian said, giving a light jump that lifted him half a foot off the ground. "It's not exactly effortless, but it's not tiring either. Just lead the way."

"My, sir, you are far more impressive than the previous ones," Uncle Fu said with an ingratiating smile.

The village had about a hundred households. The houses, built from yellow mud, wood, and thatch, were isolated and rather desolate.

After turning a corner, more than a hundred zhang west of the village's west entrance, there was an abandoned wooden house. It was built entirely of wood, with a fence around it.

No one had lived there for a long time, and weeds grew thick. But with the winter snow, the weeds had all withered under the blanket of white.

The snow was knee-deep.

"Hehe, sir, please wait a moment. I'll call someone to help you clean it up," Uncle Fu said, leaning on his crutch as he left.

Soon, he returned with five young men. They nodded respectfully to Li Xian and began clearing the snow.

Li Xian put down the massive tiger and didn't idle. He grabbed the eaves and jumped onto the roof. He stomped his feet hard; the wooden house was still quite sturdy.

Activating the "Breeze Leg," he swept his leg across the roof. The gust of wind from his leg swept the snow off, and it clattered down into the yard.

"Great!"

"Impressive!"

Uncle Fu and the others clapped in admiration. Li Xian ignored them and kicked at another spot. After a few swift kicks, the roof was completely clear of snow.

The wooden house wasn't big, but it was far better than the residences in the manor.

"Living alone here is much more comfortable than in the manor!"

Li Xian's heart filled with joy. He walked into the house: one bedroom, one living room, and one kitchen. The kitchen was built of yellow mud, making it less prone to fire.

It was just completely empty.

There were no quilts, no cooking pots, no tables or chairs. It seemed the villagers had taken everything.

"What are you standing there for?"

"Quilts, cooking pots, bring them here quickly!" Uncle Fu scolded.

After about half an hour of bustling back and forth, the house was furnished with everything needed, making it perfectly livable.

"Uncle Fu, thank you," Li Xian said, cupping his fist in gratitude.

"Oh no, it's not worthy, not worthy," Uncle Fu replied. "Sir, you've just arrived, and it's getting late. Why don't you come to my place for a meal?"

"I've hunted a mountain tiger; I can just cook it myself. Besides, you probably don't have much grain left. Another mouth to feed would surely make you worry for a long time," Li Xian said with a hearty laugh.

"Oh my!"

"Sir, you have the heart of a Bodhisattva, a true Bodhisattva's heart!" Uncle Fu exclaimed.

"What Bodhisattva? Just go on home now," Li Xian said. Seeing that darkness was falling, and the village was in the wilderness where the night was as black as paint, it would be hard to walk.

"Yes, yes. Please forgive our poor hospitality," Uncle Fu said, leading the five men away.

Li Xian rubbed his shoulders. He lit an oil lamp, brightening the room. It was now evening, and from afar, he could see the setting sun, a red orb split in half by a perilous peak.

He breathed in the mountain forest air.

Li Xian enjoyed a moment of peace. He was a free spirit by nature. Sometimes, he would prefer a more dangerous life for the sake of freedom. Of course... preserving his own life was always the most important thing.

"Now that my younger brother has gone to the prefecture city..."

"It should be going smoothly. Since Zheng Xuezhang came looking for me, he wouldn't be able to go after my brother."

Li Xiaofan was thin and weak, but very clever. And the larger the place, the harder it was for local powers like him to extend their reach.

Furthermore, Zheng Xuezhang was severely injured and couldn't attend to multiple matters at once, making Li Xiaofan even safer.

"I specifically told Auntie Liu and her husband; they shouldn't be involved. Now I have no attachments, throwing myself into the mountains..."

"Since I'm here, I might as well settle in."

"It's time to try the tiger meat!"

Li Xian's eyes glinted. He carried the tiger beast into the yard and patted its hindquarters. This tiger beast was truly a pure yang creature. Even dead for so long, it was still like a furnace.

"Before, I was hunting beasts for the Madam."

"Now, with mountains high and waters far away, this tiger beast belongs to me alone."

The feeling was completely different.

Unfortunately, it was too late to fetch water, otherwise he could have had tiger soup today.

Li Xian cut open the tiger's neck to drain the blood first. This blood wouldn't be wasted; he collected it in a jar.

Tiger blood is fierce and dry. Drinking it raw is not good, as it can make one's temperament wild and violent. But after being stewed over a large fire, it becomes a rare tonic.

"If I could have a tiger beast in my belly every day, my muscles and bones would surely be much stronger than others'!"

After draining the blood, he skinned the tiger and pulled out its teeth. The skin was relatively easy to remove, but the teeth were difficult. There was nowhere to get a good grip, and they were as hard as stone.

The massive tiger carcass was soon dissected into various parts.

The tiger's lungs, spleen, and stomach were still steaming.

"I've heard these internal organs can be used to refine Tiger Red Pills."

"But I don't know the method, and these things still contain toxins. It's better to just toss them in the snow to freeze for now," Li Xian thought.

He lit a fire.

The pot was heated until it was scorching hot. Li Xian sliced the tiger meat into thin pieces and threw them into the pot. With a sizzling sound and rising steam, the tiger meat was quickly cooked.

Eating it while hot could mask the gamey smell of the tiger meat.

Li Xian had a tremendous appetite.

When conditions were limited and he ate less, he wouldn't go hungry. But if he could eat his fill without worry, he could eat until others were dumbfounded.

Thanks to the marvel of [Consumption], warm currents flowed from his abdomen to his limbs and bones.

Tiger meat is a great tonic!

He ate and drank voraciously.

Li Xian's whole body radiated heat, his eyes were bright, and his body was like a furnace. Feeling unbearably hot, he walked out of the kitchen to feel the cold wind.

The ice and snow beneath his feet melted rapidly.

The intensity of his yang energy was visible to the naked eye.

Tiger beasts are pure yang creatures, but this yang energy is rarely digestible by humans. After eating, it dissipates, like pouring water into a leaky gourd.

But with the aid of "Consumption," Li Xian naturally ate until his yang energy overflowed.

This was also a sign that his body was just a mud shell, unable to lock in the benefits.

If Li Xian could achieve "Stabilizing the Blood and Closing the Pores," keeping the yang energy inside his body and practicing some fierce martial arts...

He would achieve twice the result with half the effort.

After resting for a moment, Li Xian sliced more tiger meat and continued to eat the dry-roasted tiger meat!

His internal energy grew increasingly abundant.
