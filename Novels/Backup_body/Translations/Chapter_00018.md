# Chapter 18: Bird Master: "He who hears the Dao in the morning can die content in the evening!"  

Early the next morning.  

"Senior Brother Li, I've brought the medicine cauldron," came the voice of the counterfeit medicine peddler.  

Li Zhengjing awoke in his room, glancing at the wall-hanging bird still fast asleep. With a chuckle, he shook his head and rose to open the door.  

After handing over a cloth bag containing five medicine cauldrons, the peddler hesitated before speaking. "The matter in Qixing Prefecture involves a demonic entity at the Inner Qi realm. Since you've only recently achieved Inner Qi, it might be too dangerous..."  

"I understand the risks," Li Zhengjing replied, then asked, "Any updates on the information I requested?"  

"Regarding Elder Yuan Zhengfeng, given his high status, we haven't uncovered anything yet," the peddler said. "As for Chen Youyu's residence in Daling City, we've confirmed it—it's only about a hundred miles from Qiling Prefecture. But..."  

"Speak plainly," Li Zhengjing said, as if he had already anticipated the hesitation.  

"A gentleman seeks revenge over ten years. I thought you merely wanted to know Chen Youyu's whereabouts for future retribution," the peddler said. "But now it seems you specifically took on the demon case in Qiling Prefecture just to make a detour to Bailing Prefecture and visit Elder Chen?"  

"..." Li Zhengjing remained silent.  

"Senior Brother, you've just attained Inner Qi and your confidence is soaring, but..."  

The peddler lowered his voice. "Chen Youyu was once an inner sect disciple himself. At his peak, his cultivation reached the 'Upper Inner Qi' level. Though he's now over sixty, his body has weakened, and his vitality has declined—he's not what he used to be. Still, a starved camel is bigger than a horse. He's no match for someone who's just entered the Inner Qi realm. Isn't this too hasty?"  

"Upper Inner Qi, huh?"  

Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow.  

In this world, the Inner Qi realm was divided into nine layers.  

After refining Inner Qi within the organs, one could circulate it through the body, unblocking meridians and enhancing strength when exerting force.  

But the true measure of Inner Qi lay in how much one could accumulate within the dantian.  

Li Zhengjing had gathered all his Inner Qi into his dantian, filling the lower portion to a height of about three inches—placing him at the third layer of the Inner Qi realm.  

- **Three inches or below**: Early-stage Inner Qi.  
- **Three to six inches**: Mid-stage Inner Qi.  
- **Above six inches**: Upper-stage Inner Qi.  
- **Nine inches**: Peak-stage Inner Qi, where Inner Qi fills the entire dantian and suffuses every part of the body.  

"I wonder how much of his former strength remains in his aged body?"  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page's "Fortune" section—unchanged—and knew this battle would still be in his favor.  

"Better to be cautious," the peddler advised. "He's old, and you're still growing. With time, the scales will tip further in your favor. Why take the risk now? Besides, everyone knows about your feud with Chen Youyu. If you leave the sect right after him, the Enforcement Hall will suspect you immediately!"  

Li Zhengjing checked the golden page again—still no change—and chuckled. "That's why I asked you to find me a Swift Travel Talisman."  

The trip to Qiling Prefecture would only take two days round trip.  

But detouring to Bailing Prefecture would delay his return.  

With a Swift Travel Talisman, he could cover a thousand miles in a day. If the Enforcement Hall investigated, he'd have an alibi—proof he was traveling when Chen Youyu died.  

"But here's the problem..."  

The peddler sighed. "The talisman master who promised to make the Swift Travel Talisman was suddenly reassigned to accompany Elder Gu of the Enforcement Hall to the capital! Since you're leaving today, there's no time to find another talisman master..."  

"I have a Swift Travel Talisman!"  

A childish voice suddenly rang out from behind.  

Li Zhengjing's expression shifted.  

The peddler jumped in fright.  

Both turned to see a white bird fluttering unsteadily out of the room and perching on the railing.  

Li Zhengjing's face darkened. He hadn't expected the bird's hearing to be so sharp—it had overheard their whispered conspiracy from inside the room. He briefly considered silencing it but quickly dismissed the idea—mainly because he couldn't beat it.  

Besides, the bird was also a fugitive, planning to flee the Feather Illumination Immortal Sect.  

"You're really going to kill someone?"  

The wall-hanging bird was visibly excited. "In my eight years of life, I've barely eaten any bugs—just elixirs and spiritual herbs. It's been so dull! I've never seen anything so bloody! I'll give you the talisman if you take me with you..."  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing was momentarily speechless. His original plan was to drop the bird off in Qiling Prefecture, handle the demon case, use the talisman to reach Bailing Prefecture, kill Chen Youyu, and then rush back to the sect.  

"Senior Brother, this is...?" The peddler stared at the talking bird, bewildered.  

"He's my closest friend!" Li Zhengjing said, mostly for the sake of the talisman.  

"Fine. Since you have the talisman, everything's set. As for the rest..." The peddler nodded. "Don't worry, Senior Brother. I run an honest business—I won't betray you."  

"I trust you!"  

Li Zhengjing patted his shoulder—though his real confidence came from the unchanging fortune on the golden page.  

Before the peddler could leave, the bird urged, "It's already dawn. We should set off and reach Bailing Prefecture before nightfall to kill him!"  

The peddler was taken aback. "Why are you in more of a hurry than he is? Do you have a grudge against Chen Youyu too?"  

"Do you understand the elegance of scholars? The thrill of vengeance? You illiterate brute!"  

The bird's eyes brimmed with pity.  

It shook its head, spat out a book, flipped a few pages with its wing, and declared triumphantly, "Come here, illiterate! It says right here—'He who hears the Dao in the morning can die content in the evening!'"  

Lifting its head proudly, it explained in a lecturing tone: "This means—once you learn his whereabouts in the morning, you can kill him by evening!"  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing was silent.  

The peddler questioned his own understanding of life.  

"If you have a grudge, killing him is poetic justice! But you must do it by evening. Killing him at night would violate the sages' teachings!"  

The bird was practically vibrating with excitement. "In my eight years of life, I've never experienced anything so thrilling! Let's hurry and become chivalrous heroes of vengeance!"  

With no further delay, Li Zhengjing finished his preparations and prepared to leave.  

"Why are you bringing a sack to kill someone?" the bird asked suspiciously.  

"To ambush him," Li Zhengjing replied.  

"Such methods are beneath us," the bird scoffed.  

"Fine, then how about this?" Li Zhengjing recited, "*Ten steps, one kill; a thousand miles, no trace.*"  

"..."  

The bird felt as if struck by lightning. *How does he come up with such lines so effortlessly? Is his literary talent truly superior to mine? After all my years of study, how am I only the third greatest scholar in the world?*  

"Let's go!"  

Li Zhengjing set off with the bird. As they descended the mountain, the world grew murkier around them.  

He glanced back at the immortal mountain, wreathed in clouds and suffused with spiritual energy, and suddenly understood the difference between sacred lands and the mortal world.  

Even the grandest city in the Great Zhou Empire paled in comparison to this serene peak.  

Thinking of the capital, Li Zhengjing recalled something.  

"Earlier, the peddler mentioned that the talisman master went to the capital with Elder Gu?"  

He frowned. *"Cultivators avoid the mortal world unless necessary—it hinders their progress. Why would they go to the capital?*  

*More importantly, the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord is hiding in the Feather Illumination Immortal Sect!*  

*Did he go to the capital alone, or is he disguised among these disciples?*  

*If it's the latter, is Elder Gu one of his identities? Or is he hiding among the group? When I return, maybe I can have the peddler investigate the list of those who went..."*  

With these thoughts, he activated the Swift Travel Talisman on his chest and strode forward with supernatural speed.  

*"Old Chen, I'm coming to send you off!"*  

---  

Meanwhile, on the only road from the Feather Illumination Immortal Sect to Qixing Prefecture...  

Chen Yang stood with his hands behind his back, concealed in the forest.  

Behind him were several inner sect disciples from the Chen family.  

"Brother, why go through all this trouble? Why ambush him so early?" one asked. "With his skills, he'll probably die to the demon in Qixing Prefecture anyway."  

"We can't leave it to chance!"  

Chen Yang replied coldly, "I'll send him to his grave myself."  

He frowned slightly. "This is the only road to Qixing Prefecture. He has to pass through here. By my calculations, he should've arrived by now. Where is he?"  

Though puzzled, he remained patient.  

After waiting half a month for this opportunity, he wasn't about to give up.  

He waited as the sun climbed to its zenith, then sank below the horizon.  

The moon rose, and the night deepened.  

The Chen family disciples stood in silence.  

Finally, Chen Yang looked up at the bright moon and sighed.  

"Let's just... pretend we came out to admire the moonlight..."
