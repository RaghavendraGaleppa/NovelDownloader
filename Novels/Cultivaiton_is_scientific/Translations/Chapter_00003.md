# Chapter 3: Generating Electricity  

"Siqin, guard the door!" Li Shiming said to the curious maid standing beside him.  

While the various parts could be explained away as his hobby, assembling them into an actual generator would be impossible to justify.  

Even though Siqin was clearly intrigued, he couldn't allow her to watch the process.  

Though reluctant, Siqin obeyed his order and left the study.  

Li Shiming began assembling the generator according to his design.  

After two hours, a peculiar box sat on the desk—a wooden case with a crank handle and three copper wires protruding from it. At first glance, it appeared unremarkable.  

The main body of the generator was concealed within the wooden casing, ensuring that even if outsiders saw it, they wouldn’t pay it much attention.  

Li Shiming attempted to turn the crank but quickly realized he had overestimated his physical strength.  

To achieve higher voltage, the generator's rotor needed to spin faster. His design used a large gear driving a smaller one to increase rotational speed, but this required significantly more effort to turn the crank.  

For a moment, he considered calling Mo Yan to help, but he dismissed the idea.  

He strained to turn the crank. Though his strength was insufficient to reach the desired speed, the sight of sparks jumping from the copper wires confirmed his success.  

Building a simple generator was never in doubt once he had procured the right components. The device wasn't particularly complex, and as someone with technical knowledge, replicating it was straightforward.  

However, his biggest challenge now was maintaining a consistent rotational speed and channeling the generated electricity into the server room's uninterruptible power supply (UPS).  

Staring at the crude generator, he willed it into the server room.  

The desk was suddenly empty—the generator had vanished and reappeared inside the server room.  

He tried using his consciousness to rotate the generator’s rotor, an idea inspired by his earlier discovery that objects within the server room could be manipulated at will.  

He had an uncanny sense of control over the server room’s interior, something that defied scientific explanation. But then again, reincarnation and the inexplicable presence of a server room in this world were already beyond logic.  

Under his mental command, the generator’s rotor began spinning, gradually increasing in speed.  

Due to technological limitations, the rotor’s bearings were wrapped in two layers of tanned cowhide, with grease applied between them for lubrication.  

At high speeds, this setup would generate heat—a factor he hadn’t fully considered during the design phase.  

---  

When designing the generator, he hadn’t accounted for the possibility of excessive rotational speeds, as achieving such speeds in this era was deemed impossible.  

Yet, by placing the generator inside the server room and using his consciousness to turn the rotor, he quickly reached the design’s speed limit.  

Fortunately, with the generator inside the server room, he could monitor every change in real-time.  

He stabilized the rotation, keeping it within safe limits.  

Measuring the output, he found that his mental control allowed the generator to produce 230 volts—far from sufficient to power a large server, but enough to charge the UPS.  

Connecting the three copper wires to the UPS’s input, he maintained a steady flow of electricity.  

When the UPS indicator turned green, he knew the first step was successful.  

The UPS began operating, converting the incoming current into stored power within its battery.  

He soon realized he could control the UPS mentally, bypassing the need to interact with its display panel.  

After half an hour of continuous mental exertion, Li Shiming felt a throbbing pain in his head.  

He immediately stopped controlling the generator—evidently, this process consumed his mental energy.  

Earlier, his brief interactions with the server room hadn’t revealed this cost, but prolonged use made it clear that such control came at a price.  

He couldn’t pinpoint the exact nature of the drain, but it seemed related to his mental stamina.  

"I can’t do this during the day anymore," he thought, rubbing his temples.  

"Young Master, what’s wrong?" Siqin gasped in alarm when he staggered out of the study, pale and unsteady.  

"Don’t alert anyone—just help me rest," he managed a reassuring smile.  

"But Young Master, you should see a physician!" Siqin protested as she supported him toward his bedroom.  

"It’s nothing serious—just mental exhaustion," he reassured her.  

Despite his fatigue, the stored power in the UPS left him strangely exhilarated.  

Lying in bed, his mind wandered back to the server room.  

The question now was whether the IBM z15 mainframe could be powered on.  

If successful, he would gain access to its vast repository of knowledge—millions of electronic books spanning philosophy, economics, law, education, literature, history, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, management, arts, and military studies.  

The server also contained published research and ongoing academic projects from his previous life.  

With this resource, he could potentially elevate this world’s technological level to match that of his past life.  

The fate of the IBM z15 would determine his path in this world.  

If it failed to start, his only option would be to follow his father Li Wenyuan’s wishes—pursue the imperial examinations and enter the bureaucracy.  

With the server room’s storage and retrieval capabilities, passing the exams would be effortless.  

But if the mainframe worked… the possibilities were endless.
