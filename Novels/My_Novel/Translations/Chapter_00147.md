# Chapter 147: The Martial Dao Realm, From Now On, Shed the Mortal Shell!

Li Xian was strolling through the "Hundred Martial Pavilion," carefully selecting martial arts techniques.

He had set his sights on a Grade C martial art, the "Floating Willow Sword Art," and intended to purchase it, but his pockets were light. With his current wealth and influence, it would take several more years of accumulation before he would have the qualifications to even aspire to it.

After browsing for a while longer, he finally settled on the "Iron Copper Body" technique.

This martial art fell somewhere between "Basic Martial Arts" and "Grade C Martial Arts." It cost two hundred taels, was not locked behind any restrictions, and was relatively cheap.

It was a purely defensive martial art.

By cultivating an iron body and copper skin, one could withstand blows from others. Firstly, Li Xian was drawn by its novelty, and secondly, he truly had not seen any defensive martial arts in his wife's treasury.

Thus, he bought it.

Opening the cover, the first thing he read was: "The Iron Copper Body technique uses Qi to control the body. Upon reaching Great Perfection, the body will be as iron, the flesh as copper, and one will fear no blade."

"To cultivate this technique, one must use medicinal baths. Nine rounds of training and nine rounds of soaking are required to see true results. The suffering involved is truly unspeakable. Those with an unsteady mind or wavering will may give up cultivation to avoid wasting their time."

Li Xian skimmed through it, getting a general idea.

He stroked his chin, pondering to himself: "This martial art is indeed not weak. I have been practicing for a year and have mastered six martial arts: Four Directions Fist, Breeze Legs, Great Luo Blade, Jade Green Palm, Ascending Cloud Hand, and Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword."

"The Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword is the most powerful. After that, it would be the Jade Green Palm, but that palm technique is incomplete. Although it is a Grade C palm technique, it has a fatal flaw. In comparison... this Iron Copper Body technique is slightly better than the Jade Green Palm."

He immediately began to read it in detail.

The book was primarily text, supplemented by diagrams. The content was concise, but due to the limited space, many areas were vague and lacked detailed explanations.

Li Xian understood.

His wife had once said that among the martial arts in the world, 99.9 percent can be traced back to their origins. They all evolved from other martial arts.

This "Iron Copper Body" was the same. The unclear and illogical parts of the record were often remnants left over from its predecessor martial arts. They could be dross, or they could be essence.

"It is said that Heaven rewards diligence. As long as one trains recklessly, martial arts will always improve."

"However, to fully unleash the power of a martial art, one must understand its core principles. One cannot swallow a martial art whole. It must be studied carefully."

Li Xian thought to himself.

The cultivation of this martial art was quite simple.

It focused on "training" and "soaking." The "training" involved using a special method to continuously strike the body, injuring the physique to the point where the skin and flesh bleed.

Then, one would immediately soak in a specific medicinal bath. The medicinal properties would seep into the flesh and be completely absorbed.

The skin and flesh would become sturdier, and when facing an opponent, the ability to withstand blows would naturally be stronger.

The herbs for the medicinal bath were not cheap. One bath would cost an estimated twenty taels of silver.

"With my current conditions, I can barely afford to cultivate this technique."

"The ability to withstand blows is secondary."

"My current Qi Lake is over fourteen zhang long. It is only one step away from a qualitative transformation. Learning another martial art can speed up the process and help me accumulate internal Qi."

Li Xian had bought this martial art several days ago. Over the past few days, he had been gathering the herbs and had already purchased a four-day supply.

Everything is ready, only the east wind is missing.

Li Xian ordered someone to boil the medicinal liquid.

He, meanwhile, practiced the special method of striking his physique in the courtyard. He raised his palm, fingers spread, and slammed it forcefully against his chest.

This "Iron Copper Body" technique seemed to train the body and flesh, but it actually refined the "lungs."

The method of striking was to strike the chest. Below the chest were the lungs. The empty cavity of the lungs was compressed by the external force, making a drum-like sound.

At this time, the five orifices were tightly closed, and the sound reverberated within the body. It passed from the organs to the blood, from the blood to the flesh, and from the flesh to the skin. Every part of the body was shaken.

Whether it was true or false that the Iron Copper Body, upon reaching Great Perfection, would make one's "body like iron" and "flesh like copper," fearing no blade, was unknown.

But possessing a "iron lung" was a certainty.

The ferocity of a warrior lies not only in the power of their martial arts but also in the various benefits brought by tempering the entire body during cultivation.

Li Xian struck several times. Not paying attention, he used too much force, and with a "pfft," he spat out blood.

"Cough, cough."

Li Xian wiped his mouth and smiled to himself, "Don't go and beat myself to death."

There was risk in this martial art. The lungs are delicate organs. If the force is excessive or insufficient, the light consequence is severe lung injury, inability to breathe, and weak breath. The heavy consequence is bleeding in the lungs, triggering other symptoms, and dying on the spot.

[You struck your chest to temper your body, Proficiency +1]
[Iron Copper Body]
[Proficiency: 12/500, Novice]

Li Xian struck his chest. The shockwave propagated through his skin and flesh. Each strike sent a numbing sensation through his entire body. His skin gradually turned red, and blood seeped from his flesh.

He struck until he reached his limit.

Then, he boiled the herbs and soaked his entire body in them.

[You soaked in the toughening medicinal bath, Proficiency +25]
[You transformed your blood and moistened your body, Proficiency +36]

"Combining it with the medicinal bath method, the cultivation speed of this martial art will be much faster!"

Inside the water vat.

Li Xian soaked in the medicinal water, and threads of medicinal power flowed into his body. This medicine also had restorative effects. The injuries on Li Xian's body from the striking quickly healed.

Strike, soak, repeat. Li Xian possessed the [Perfect Physique] and [Heavy Pupil Physique].

The Perfect Physique naturally increased recovery and healing abilities. The [Heavy Pupil Physique] was even more miraculous. When manifested, his strength would grow out of nowhere, like a tiger or a dragon, possessing immense power and a resilient physical body.

The two combined.

Li Xian cultivated this Iron Copper Body technique as if aided by the gods. An ordinary person would have to stop after a hundred strikes and rest for several days before practicing again.

Li Xian, however, felt no pressure and could strike three hundred times, or even over four hundred times.

His progress was naturally extremely fast.

[Iron Copper Body]
[Proficiency: 123/1000, Proficient]

Combined with the medicinal bath method, he had already reached Proficiency by the second day. His breathing was long and steady. The moment he condensed his Qi, his entire body's skin and flesh would tremble, as if covered by an invisible layer of armor.

"My current martial arts, although their grade is average, are becoming more and more comprehensive!"

Li Xian was delighted by his own progress.

Leopard Blade Sect.

The entrance was desolate. A black coffin blocked the vermilion gate, inside which were buried a hand and a foot, which had already begun to rot, with flies buzzing around them.

There was a time when this sect was glorious. It was like a strong dragon suppressing the local snakes. The three halls and two sects dared not utter a word of dissent. It suppressed Qingning with unparalleled prestige.

The Madam was gone, but her might remained. The black coffin alone had cut off all paths of survival.

In the courtyard.

Xu Lifeng's eyes were sunken. He stood on one leg. The right trouser leg and sleeve were empty. His left hand leaned on a great blade. Though his body was crippled, his presence was imposing. A thin beard fluttered on his chin.

"You are all my direct disciples. I am facing a great calamity. Why have you not fled?" Xu Lifeng asked calmly.

Below him, over a dozen disciples knelt on one knee.

"This disciple is willing to live and die with the Master!" Yang Tong said loudly. The other disciples followed suit.

"Good, very good! You are all my good disciples. My years of nurturing have not been in vain!"

A sharp light flashed in Xu Lifeng's eyes. "If we can overcome this calamity, I will teach you the true essence of the Leopard Blade Sect!"

Hearing this, the disciples' eyes lit up. A martial art is hard to come by, especially for those born into poverty.

Xu Lifeng said, "Although you have followed me for decades, I have never told you of my origins, nor the various connections of the Leopard Blade Sect. At this moment of life and death, I have seen your loyalty. Today, I should let you know the inside story."

"What happens today is of great importance. If you hear it, there is no turning back. It also involves the secret martial art passed down by my ancestors. Are you willing to change your surname to Xu?"

The disciples rushed to say, "This disciple is willing! This disciple would be honored!"

"Good, then I shall speak." Xu Lifeng waved his left hand. His blade moved like the wind, incredibly fast. He slashed through the air several times, the blade wind generated blowing the disciples off balance. It was truly formidable.

He said, "You have practiced the Leopard Blade for many years. You should know that this blade technique emphasizes speed and ferocity. It trains the spine and leopard tendons. The body is like a black bow, and wielding the blade is like shooting an arrow."

"This Leopard Blade was created by my ancestors. It was used to temper the spine and bones of the Xu clan. Once the spine is trained to be like a tiger or a dragon, one can further practice the family's secret martial art."

"Unfortunately, my talent is limited. I have only glimpsed a fraction of that secret martial art. I have seen your loyalty."

"That secret martial art is..."

Xu Lifeng paused, looking around warily, and then said:

"Walls have ears... In this way, you ten, for the next few days, will live separately. You are not allowed to contact each other. I will personally visit each of you every night to teach you a part of it."

"After this calamity is over, you will combine your knowledge, fill in the gaps, and receive my true transmission."

The disciples excitedly said, "Thank you, Master."

And so it was. The disciples separated to live. The Leopard Blade Sect occupied a large area, and the houses were far apart.

Each waited in his own room, filled with anticipation. They had served the Master for years for the sake of the true essence of martial arts. They competed for favor among themselves to gain his appreciation.

Xu Lifeng watched the backs of his disciples, his gaze deep and dark. A moment of reluctance flashed through it, but it was soon replaced by ruthlessness.

That night.

"Master, you have come!"

The eldest disciple, Liu Fu, was tossing and turning, unable to sleep. He saw a dark figure standing outside the door. The figure was undoubtedly the Master.

He guessed it was to teach the secret martial art and immediately went to open the door. He saw Xu Lifeng's face was cold and indifferent, completely without the comfort and harmony of the daytime.

Xu Lifeng closed the door, his right hand grabbing the disciple's pulse, and a shake of his shoulder. His left sleeve, wrapped around a golden blade, instantly decapitated the disciple.

Blood should have gushed out like a fountain.

But Xu Lifeng's hand, which was on the pulse, had already sealed the blood in advance. As the head rolled off, Xu Lifeng aimed at the severed neck and sucked frantically.

It turned out...

Teaching the secret martial art was a lie. He had said those words on purpose to keep these disciples willingly staying,供他隨時取用 (for him to use at any time).

He had already transformed into a ginseng person. The blood ginseng in his body required blood to sustain it. These disciples had secretly helped him capture some virtuous women for him to drink their blood. But it was not satisfying enough. The blood of commoners was not pleasant to drink.

And his direct disciples had all consumed [Essential Treasures], and some had even developed characteristics of consuming essence. This kind of precious blood was what he truly desired.

"Li Xian, you killed my disciples. I will be irreconcilable with you!" Xu Lifeng howled, shifting the blame for killing his disciples onto Li Xian.

Drinking his disciple's blood, the blood ginseng in his body glowed faintly. It seemed to have extracted a few wisps of heavenly and earthly essence.

Xu Lifeng was stunned. He stared at his disciple's remains, and greed flashed in his eyes. "Good, good disciple. You truly have not wasted my nurturing. Usually, Master boiled the Essential Treasures, and you consumed the most. I didn't expect that after your death, you would still give back like this."

He was now like a demon, a monster. Having become a ginseng person, he was no longer considered human. By a twist of fate, he could, like a demon, treat people as food.

"My good disciples... wait for me to digest them slowly."

"I seem to have seen the scenery of the second realm of the Martial Dao."

The sixth day of the eighth month.

The sky was clear and vast. The summer heat was not intense. The breeze was gentle, very comfortable.

The essential food in the cauldron was complete.

"Your chest is booming like thunder. If I am not mistaken, you will soon grow a life-hair. The moment the life-hair grows, you will have officially stepped into the first realm of the Martial Dao."

"I will say no more. You may go and experience it for yourself."

The Madam glanced at Li Xian. With a light划 of her jade-handled knife, she separated two palm-sized pieces of essential meat.

Li Xian distributed the remaining essential soup appropriately.

He returned to the commander's courtyard.

He drank the essential soup and ate the essential meat.

On this day... he would surely step into the first realm of the Martial Dao!
