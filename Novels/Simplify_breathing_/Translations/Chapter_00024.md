# Chapter 24: The Act

Sun Shu's expression was grim. After some thought, he decided to let Chen Fei go for now. Such a long-distance chase would be too ostentatious, and with the Zhang family's bounty on him, he might even be caught.

Just as Sun Shu was about to stop, he suddenly noticed Chen Fei's pace ahead slow down. Although still faster than an ordinary Skin-Refinement realm martial artist, or even a Flesh-Refinement realm one, it was now within Sun Shu's acceptable range.

"Was that a secret technique just now?" Sun Shu pondered, feeling this was more reasonable. Otherwise, that kind of movement technique speed, which even he, a Bone-Forging realm martial artist, didn't possess, appearing on a Skin-Refinement realm practitioner, was simply inexplicable.

"Kid, let's see where you run to!" Sun Shu sneered, pushing off his feet and giving chase. In just a moment, the distance between them halved, now only about twenty meters. At this rate, Sun Shu could catch Chen Fei in a few breaths.

Seeming to feel the pressure from behind, Chen Fei seized the opportunity to glance back at Sun Shu, seeing the distance between them continuously shrinking. His face turned pale with fright.

Seeing Chen Fei's expression, Sun Shu couldn't help but reveal a sinister grin. He loved seeing people like this, just like those low-ranking servants whose life and death were completely in his hands.

As if compelled by the pressure of death, when Sun Shu closed in to about ten meters, Chen Fei's movement technique unexpectedly sped up slightly, gradually widening the gap between him and Sun Shu again.

Sun Shu was almost driven mad by chasing Chen Fei. The elusive feeling of nearly capturing Chen Fei was getting to him. But at this moment, seeing his surroundings, Sun Shu suddenly woke up.

In a few hundred more meters, he would reach the Zhang family's mansion. At this moment, Sun Shu seemed high-spirited, thinking he could kill anyone he wanted. But if he truly went to the Zhang family, he would be the one to die. In fact, even dying might not be easy; being tortured was a certainty.

Sun Shu immediately stopped, glaring at Chen Fei with a malevolent gaze, deciding to retreat first. This location was too dangerous. No matter how much Sun Shu wanted to kill Chen Fei, he wouldn't gamble his own life.

"Hmm?" Chen Fei, who was running forward, noticed the lack of movement behind him and couldn't help but glance back, just in time to see Sun Shu stop, his chilling gaze fixed upon him.

Chen Fei spun around, landing on a rooftop. He leaned forward, hands on his knees, panting heavily as if he would collapse from exhaustion at any moment.

"Consider yourself lucky. The next time we meet will be your death day!" Sun Shu looked at Chen Fei, who appeared so frail he could be easily choked to death, making him want to step forward. But Sun Shu ultimately hesitated, then turned and vanished into an alley.

Chen Fei watched Sun Shu leave, then his heavy panting abruptly ceased, and he slowly straightened his body.

Chen Fei had originally intended to find Zhang Sinan to ask about the recipe for the Light Spirit Pill. However, it was already late, and going to Zhang Sinan at this hour would likely get him thrown out.

Chen Fei circled through several alleys. When he emerged, his appearance had completely changed. A scar ran from the corner of his eye all the way to the corner of his mouth, making him look sinister and ferocious.

Donning a mask and a bamboo hat, Chen Fei appeared in the black market.

"Here are the pills for this time," Chen Fei said, handing over a medicine bottle as he approached the stall.

"The quality is getting better and better!" The stall owner glanced at the pills in the bottle, a smile blooming on his face. Although Chen Fei only came once every few days, his supply was consistently stable, and the pills were of excellent quality, making them very easy to sell.

"Here's your money."
