# Chapter 16: The Mystical Jade Pillar and Self-Generating Spirit Water  

**Boom!**  

"Gu Yuan!"  

"Qiu Mingshan!"  

"This is too much!"  

In a quiet chamber within the Lan family estate on Wanlei Island, Lan Tianlu kicked over everything on the table in a fit of rage, his face twisted with fury.  

"That damn thief!"  

"He stole my opportunity!"  

"This grudge is as deep as killing my parents!"  

With disheveled hair, Lan Tianlu slammed his fist against the wall, his face filled with bitter resentment.  

He had spent countless efforts to uncover this secret and had exhausted all his personal wealth to bribe Qiu Mingshan with rare treasures.  

He thought everything was foolproof, but someone had still managed to interfere.  

"Elder Hu hasn't left the mountain for years since his disciple died—why would he suddenly recommend a Five-Aperture Body brat?!"  

"Could he be that senior sister's descendant?"  

"Or... did that kid accidentally uncover the truth behind her death?"  

"Damn it all!"  

"Just because of some vague karmic connection, he snatched away all my hard work—that bastard deserves to die!"  

The more Lan Tianlu thought about it, the angrier he became, his eyes turning bloodshot.  

"I must find out what connection this kid has with the elder!"  

"If he truly has the elder's backing, then I, Lan Tianlu, am simply unlucky and overstepped!"  

"But if he's just bluffing... Gu Yuan, just you wait!"  

As Lan Tianlu recalled Gu Yuan's face, murderous intent surged uncontrollably in his heart.  

"It'll take time for that kid to uncover the secrets of the Four Spirit Jade Pillars. Even if I lose the Azure Crane Spirit Water, as long as I obtain the remaining three, I can still change my fate!"  

This thought finally calmed him slightly.  

But just then, a servant's voice sounded outside the chamber.  

"Young Master, Lady Lin has sent an invitation. In seven days, she will host a celebration for the young master's birthday and requests your presence at Yulin Island."  

Hearing this, Lan Tianlu's expression darkened further.  

The reason he had kept his plans secret and refrained from using the family's resources was simple—he was no longer the most favored member of the Lan family.  

His uncle, Lan Tianming, had once been solely devoted to cultivation and had no children of his own, so he doted on his nephew.  

But to break through his cultivation bottleneck, Lan Tianming had no choice but to marry into the Lin family, another prominent clan.  

In just three years, the Lin family sent three sisters to serve him, and eventually, the second daughter, Lin Sixi, bore him a son.  

After the child's birth, Lan Tianming's attitude toward Lan Tianlu remained unchanged.  

But Lan Tianlu didn't dare take the risk.  

After all, the opportunity within the cave abode was extremely precious. If the Lan family obtained it, he feared it would never fall into his hands.  

So he had to act in secret.  

The mere thought of this filled him with bitterness, and he began to resent that child.  

After a long silence, a cold voice finally emerged from the chamber:  

"Understood."  

---  

**Clang! Clang!**  

At this moment, Gu Yuan was unaware of Lan Tianlu's thoughts.  

Inside his own quiet chamber, he repeatedly tapped the jade pillar, probing it with his spiritual energy and even using blood essence techniques.  

Yet, he found nothing unusual.  

"It seems I'll have to visit the Scripture Pavilion and consult some records..."  

Gu Yuan sighed in frustration.  

The Qingfeng Dao Academy was a major sect with a vast Scripture Pavilion containing countless records of rare treasures, strange artifacts, unique cultivation techniques, and mystical phenomena.  

It was a true treasury of knowledge.  

However, aside from basic texts, many of the rare records required payment in spirit stones to access.  

This wasn't an attempt to exploit the disciples but a necessary measure—without restrictions, many cultivators would lose themselves in endless study.  

Moreover, some "forbidden techniques" could bring shame to the academy if carelessly learned.  

Gu Yuan had hoped to figure things out on his own to save the expense, but his knowledge was still too limited.  

Though the academy's collection was vast, the world was boundless, and not all secrets were recorded.  

"Still, it's better than groping in the dark."  

"While I'm there, I might as well research the origins of the Celestial Court, the Dragon, and the Dao Academy."  

After some thought, Gu Yuan decided to visit the Scripture Pavilion—but not immediately.  

Visiting right after entering the cave abode would seem too deliberate.  

"First, I'll collect the spirit water and cultivate for a while."  

Looking at the gently rippling spirit water in the jade cup and the abundant spiritual energy in the chamber, Gu Yuan made his plan.  

He retrieved a jade vial from his storage pouch and, with a surge of spiritual energy, formed an invisible net to carefully scoop the spirit water from the cup into the vial.  

Everything went smoothly.  

But the moment the spirit water disappeared, the jade pillar suddenly changed.  

The lifelike Azure Crane pattern on the easternmost pillar dimmed drastically before fading away completely, as if it had never existed.  

Meanwhile, a new pattern emerged on the southern pillar—a silver-scaled dragon.  

Its cold, gleaming scales and commanding presence exuded an overwhelming majesty.  

**Hummm!**  

As the dragon pattern appeared, the pillar began to glow, emitting a strange suction force.  

**Whoosh!**  

A gust of wind seemed to rise in the chamber as spiritual energy surged toward the pillar. The dragon's mouth opened slightly, as if swallowing the energy.  

**Drip... Drip...**  

At the same time, the sound of droplets echoed in the jade cup.  

Silver liquid materialized out of thin air, dripping into the vessel.  

"This is... a new spirit water?"  

Gu Yuan was stunned.  

It turned out the true treasure wasn't the spirit water—it was the jade pillar itself!  

After collecting one portion of spirit water, the pillar could generate a new pattern, absorbing spiritual energy to produce another portion from nothingness!  

"What kind of artifact is this? It's beyond mystical!"  

Gu Yuan inhaled sharply.  

"There are two more sides to the pillar—does that mean two more spirit waters? Four in total?"  

"Wait, that's not the key point. The real question is—is this a one-time occurrence, or can it regenerate indefinitely?"  

"If it's permanent... does that mean this pillar is a spirit water generator?"  

His heart pounded wildly.  

But in the next moment, he realized the truth.  

"If it were truly permanent, it wouldn't just be a silver-tier opportunity. Lan Tianlu wouldn't have fought so hard for it."  

"So the pillar can only produce four portions?"  

"And this silver dragon pattern—what kind of spirit water does it represent?"  

Questions swirled in Gu Yuan's mind, and he once again felt the limitations of his knowledge from the Qingmu Sect.  

Back there, he had never even heard of mid-grade spirit water, let alone this Silver Dragon Spirit Water.  

This second portion appeared after the first, and the dragon pattern seemed far more formidable than the crane.  

Could it be... a supreme-grade spirit water?  

Excitement surged through him.  

If so, then in this first step of cultivation, he could rival the heirs of Golden Core powerhouses!
