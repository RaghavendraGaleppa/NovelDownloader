# Chapter 216: Instructions

Li Yuanba had spent a full year under Sword Elder's tutelage, during which he had hardly left Ten Thousand Swords Peak. The primary reason was that he needed to replace his core cultivation technique—a process equivalent to shattering his spiritual lake and starting anew.

Fortunately, both the "Ten Thousand Sword Cultivation Art" and the "Sword Intent Soaring Art" were sword cultivation techniques. Even when rebuilding his foundation, he could maintain his Core Formation realm without falling back to Qi Refining. Had he chosen to switch to a spell cultivation or non-sword cultivation technique, he would have had to start over from Qi Refining, which would have taken far too long.

A cultivator's time was precious. While Qi Refiners could live over a hundred years and Foundation Establishment cultivators up to two hundred, their cultivation time was always tight. At most, they had one hundred and fifty years to cultivate in the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages. If they failed to break through to the Golden Core stage by then, further advancement would be impossible. After one hundred and fifty years, a Foundation Establishment cultivator's body would begin to decline, making it difficult to even maintain their current realm, let alone attempt a breakthrough.

Li Yuanba, blessed with a Heavenly Spiritual Root and an exceptionally solid foundation from his Qi Refining stage, managed to master the "Sword Intent Soaring Art"—a top-tier sword cultivation technique—in just one year. His realm remained roughly the same as a year ago, but his combat prowess had undergone a dramatic transformation.

After studying the "Sword Intent Soaring Art," he truly understood the gap between the two techniques. The "Ten Thousand Sword Cultivation Art" focused on tempering sword intent within the body, while the "Sword Intent Soaring Art" not only achieved the same effect but could also absorb external sword intent. Every time he practiced the latter, he could draw sword intent from Ten Thousand Swords Peak into his body, enhancing his own.

Li Yuanba gradually uncovered the secrets of Ten Thousand Swords Peak. The peak was essentially a massive magical artifact—an entire magnetic mountain infused with countless resources by a sword cultivation sect. Over generations, sword cultivators who had mastered sword intent left their flying swords embedded in the mountain. This forging process had spanned countless years.

A sword cultivator would replace their flying sword several times in their lifetime—typically when crossing major realms. In the Qi Refining stage, they used magical artifact-grade flying swords; in Foundation Establishment, spirit artifact-grade; and in Golden Core, treasure-grade. The discarded swords, having been nourished by the cultivator's sword intent for years, retained traces of that intent.

A single such sword might not be remarkable, but when tens of thousands of them were gathered—with five treasure-grade swords containing powerful sword intent as the core—an unimaginable, colossal legacy artifact was born. Ten Thousand Swords Peak was a creation beyond the imagination of pre-reincarnation technology, having taken ten thousand years to forge—a timespan exceeding even the lifespan of previous civilizations.

Li Yuanba could only imagine how glorious the unnamed sword cultivation sect must have been in history to achieve such a feat. Just procuring the materials for a mountain-sized artifact, let alone gathering ten thousand sword-intent-infused flying swords, would be impossible even if every sword cultivator in the Northern Shu Continent were captured today.

Such a legacy artifact ultimately became the cause of the sect's downfall. Not that Li Yuanba sympathized—sword cultivators rarely engaged in production, meaning all their resources were plundered. The fact that the elders of the Netherworld Sect had seized Ten Thousand Swords Peak was poetic justice.

Regardless, Li Yuanba reaped the benefits. His spiritual power grew denser, and his sword intent tripled within a year—all thanks to Ten Thousand Swords Peak.

It had been over a month since he last saw Sword Elder. The elder held a unique position in the Netherworld Sect as the strongest Golden Core cultivator, often dispatched to resolve conflicts involving Golden Core adversaries.

As Li Yuanba stood atop Ten Thousand Swords Peak, contemplating sword intent, a streak of sword light approached from afar.

"Greetings, Master!" He immediately halted his practice and bowed.

Sword Elder's aura was unusually sharp—a rare sight. Having cultivated the "Sword Intent Soaring Art," Li Yuanba knew that concealing sword intent was meant to better nurture it, allowing for more explosive releases when needed. Sword Elder's unrestrained sword intent suggested he had recently faced a formidable opponent, forcing him to unleash his full power.

"Yuanba, prepare to accompany the sect's disciples to the Boundary Mountain Pass. Sword cultivators hone their intent through battle—yours has grown too quickly through pure cultivation," Sword Elder said with a faint smile.

He was highly satisfied with Li Yuanba's progress. Rebuilding one's foundation was no easy feat—the pain of shattering a spiritual lake and the determination required were beyond most. Li Yuanba's talent and mental fortitude made him the ideal disciple, raising Sword Elder's expectations.

Within the Netherworld Sect, only Sword Elder and Li Yuanba cultivated the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion's techniques. The elder was determined to nurture Li Yuanba to his fullest potential. Returning to the Sword Intent Soaring Pavilion was Sword Elder's lifelong goal, though the odds were slim—even as a late Golden Core cultivator, his chances of forming an infant soul were minimal.

To earn the sect's support, he tirelessly eliminated threats, having slain over twenty Golden Core cultivators—a staggering feat, given how difficult it was to kill peers without overwhelming superiority.

"Has something happened at the Boundary Mountain Pass?" Li Yuanba asked curiously.

Given Sword Elder's condition, few opponents could force him to go all out. A late Golden Core sword cultivator was virtually invincible in the absence of Nascent Soul experts. Li Yuanba recalled rumors from his main body, Li Shiming, about impending conflict between righteous and demonic factions—was war about to break out?

"Three Arhats from the Thousand Leaves Temple ambushed Elder Ye, destroying his silver corpse and severely injuring him. I killed one Arhat, but the temple will retaliate soon. Combined with recent tensions between righteous and demonic factions, this incident will likely ignite a larger conflict," Sword Elder replied calmly.

As a sword cultivator, he welcomed battle—it was the fastest path to growth. Li Yuanba himself had only grasped sword intent threads after a life-and-death duel, despite years of cultivation yielding little progress.

"Here," Sword Elder tossed a storage bracelet. "This is the Arhat's body. Extract the relic—his physique reached the Golden Core pinnacle, nearly indestructible. It'll greatly aid your body tempering."

Li Yuanba was stunned. An Arhat's body—especially one at the peak of body cultivation—was priceless. Arhats were Buddhist Golden Core cultivators renowned for their physical prowess, with many body tempering techniques originating from Buddhism. While Daoists focused on soul and spirit, Buddhists perfected the body as a vessel for the soul.

That Sword Elder simply gifted such a treasure was astonishing. Most Golden Core elders would pay exorbitant prices for it—the ultimate material for crafting silver corpses. Though Li Yuanba lacked the means to refine it now, destroying it for the relic would be wasteful. Clearly, Sword Elder was providing resources while leaving their use to his disciple.

"Thank you, Master!" Li Yuanba accepted the bracelet, inspecting the monk's corpse within. Even dead, the body radiated terrifying pressure—he doubted he could survive a finger's touch from the Arhat in life.

"One more thing." Sword Elder handed over a prayer bead. "Righteous cultivators are deceitful—they might break rules. If a Golden Core expert attacks, crush this. It contains a strand of my sword intent."

The bead, likely looted from the Arhat, made Li Yuanba's hair stand on end upon contact—a primal reaction to overwhelming danger. He knew the contained intent was genuine Golden Core power.

"I'll be careful," he said, storing the bead.

"Sword cultivators don't fight to the death. Retreat if overwhelmed, strike decisively when you can," Sword Elder advised, though he knew Li Yuanba was experienced.

The elder had recently battled three Arhats, exhausting years of accumulated sword intent to kill one and drive off the others. The remaining intent was sealed into the bead—a tragic waste, as such artifacts could repeatedly store Golden Core power. But sword cultivators cared little for material possessions beyond their utility.

Bidding farewell, Li Yuanba joined two hundred other Foundation Establishment disciples preparing to depart. His presence drew little attention—his brief fame from a year ago had faded, and his ascension to true disciple status had been a quiet affair. With his sword intent now concealed, most assumed he was just another outer disciple, clustering around the dozen or so true disciples for protection in battle.
