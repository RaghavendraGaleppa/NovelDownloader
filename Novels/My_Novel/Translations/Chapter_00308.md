# Chapter 308: The Fragrant Contest

The crowd turned to look, seeing Gu Nianjun's extraordinary beauty. Her purple dress fluttered, her temperament was elegant, and everyone's hearts stirred. They thought, "This temple fair truly attracts people from all directions; such a beautiful woman has come to participate! If I display my exceptional talents, I might win her favor!"

Li Xun looked toward the voice and saw Gu Nianjun, Zhou Shijie, and Li Xiaofan. He was pleasantly surprised, never expecting to see his younger brother here. He looked closely and noticed that his brother's appearance had changed, gradually shedding his childish air and becoming quite handsome. He felt deeply how time flies and how things change.

Wang Dezhong of the Jiushan Sword Sect was even more excited, his face flushed with unconcealed pride and joy. He chatted enthusiastically with Gu Nianjun. Gu Nianjun smiled faintly, maintaining proper etiquette, and they exchanged names. She also greeted Zhou Shijie and Li Xiaofan one by one.

They were roughly the same age and came from major sects, possessing excellent talent and aptitude. They secretly admired each other and naturally started chatting together.

Gu Nianjun asked, "May I ask, hero, what is your relationship with Senior Wang Shulong?"

Wang Dezhong said, "Miss Gu knows my father?" Gu Nianjun smiled. "No wonder this hero can execute the 'Iron Heart Sword Art' so brilliantly; you truly have your father's style. A tiger father does not beget a dog son."

Wang Dezhong laughed. "You flatter me, you flatter me. My little skills are just showing off clumsily."

Zhou Shijie said, "Brother Wang is too modest. This Eight-Nine Iron-Core Incense... it has an iron core inside. Just picking it up requires considerable strength, let alone igniting the iron core!"

Gu Nianjun said, "I remember that in the past, the 'Unyielding Sword Hero,' Senior Wang Shulong, visited my Gu family and even guided me in swordsmanship. It is truly fate that brings us together. Hearing the reputation of your family today is truly an honor."

"Ah!" Wang Dezhong said joyfully, "My father is also in Flying Dragon City. Since you are old acquaintances, why don't I introduce you so you can meet again?"

Gu Nianjun smiled. "That would be wonderful."

The conversation among them was loud and clear, the atmosphere quite harmonious. Ordinary people watched as if gods were conversing, speaking of wind, flowers, snow, and moon; visions of the martial way; family backgrounds; and connections between elders... all sorts of elegant matters. They couldn't help but look on with envy from afar. Martial artists with family backgrounds glanced over, eager to show off their talents and join the conversation to make friends.

The exotic incenses were all stored in special wooden boxes. The young heroes who could afford these exotic incenses had been secretly observing each other. On the cliffside shrine next to the narrow path behind, some young figures had already displayed their prowess.

They didn't know each other's origins or names, but they were all aware of each other's existence. Zhou Shijie was elegant and graceful; his martial arts might not be the strongest, but he possessed a special aura of fortune. He was slightly older and his demeanor was quite convincing. He smiled at a man and said, "Brother, may I ask what incense you have prepared?"

He saw that everyone was eager to try but also hesitant. They wanted to be the final act to amaze the crowd, but they feared their skills were inferior. They were also afraid of showing off deliberately and provoking the厌恶 of their peers. Thus, they hesitated. With this one remark from Zhou Shijie, he broke the deadlock, allowing everyone to shine.

The man laughed heartily. "Since that's the case, it's my turn to show off. I hope you all won't laugh at me."

All the heroes holding exotic incense said, "Brother, please go ahead. We are here to pray for the common people; the intention matters more than the form." "Yes, we are not setting up a stage for a tournament." "Everyone has gathered here from all corners. It is a clear day with light clouds, a fine time and a good day. We just need to display our talents to the fullest."

The heroes from all over spoke with great poise. Gu Nianjun nodded secretly and said to Li Xiaofan, "Xiaofan, these prodigies and heroes come from famous orthodox sects. Their martial arts and character are both excellent. Since you are traveling and studying, if you have the chance, you should make friends with them."

Li Xiaofan said, "Okay." But he thought, "This temple fair carries the hopes of the people's livelihood. It is the寄托 of ordinary people's hopes. Though it is ethereal, it is a good thing to give people hope. My brother entered the One Union Manor as a servant. I had no choice but to go to temples to pray to the gods for protection. The common people here are probably doing the same. And these young heroes, coming from famous orthodox sects, their character and morality might indeed be good. But they are here to show off, stealing the spotlight. In my opinion, that is not very good."

He looked around. The common people were all watching silently, only seeing the young heroes display their power. Li Xiaofan felt this in his heart but said nothing.

The man opened the wooden box and took out the "Jade Tablet Incense." Gu Nianjun, Li Xiaofan, and Zhou Shijie had all seen this incense before. The body of the incense was like white jade, and when burned, it emitted a pure fragrance. Its appearance was so exquisite one couldn't bear to let it burn. The man smiled. "Which brother can lend me a light?"

A young hero said, "I'll lend you a light!" He walked out from the crowd, pointed two fingers together at the Jade Tablet Incense. With a *hum*, the incense lit up.

Gu Nianjun nodded and praised, "The one who lent the light is a disciple of the Lishan Sword Sect. The martial art he used is the 'Li Fire Heart-Finger.' His attainment is quite impressive."

She thought, "The temple fair is bustling with activity, gathering heroes from all directions. Their character and morality are exceptional. Getting to know everyone at this event would be a great joy. I have been studying poetry and books in my residence and have few friends and confidants. It's not that I don't want to make friends, but the poor land of Qiongfu is a place of exile. Even in the provincial capital, talent is scarce, and there is always a sense of crudeness. These young heroes, coming from famous great sects and possessing excellent martial arts... they are indeed worth knowing."

Her mood was very pleasant; she hadn't participated in such a grand event for a long time.

The man held the "Jade Tablet Incense," opened his mouth and took a deep breath, then exhaled. From his mouth, a white mist tiger emerged, roaring towards the sky, making阵阵 roars. He opened his mouth and exhaled again, and a white mist leopard appeared vividly.

The man smiled. "Go!" He tossed the Jade Tablet Incense. The tiger and leopard caught the incense and inserted it into the bronze incense burner. The mist of the tiger and leopard gradually faded and disappeared. The smoke of the Jade Tablet Incense was clear, and a faint fragrance spread, adding to the atmosphere.

Gu Nianjun saw that Li Xiaofan didn't understand the intricacies. She wanted him to make more friends with his peers, so she said, "Xiaofan, this hero... if I'm not mistaken, should be from the 'Thunder Gate.' Just now, he inhaled the mist first, then exhaled the tiger and leopard. That is the move 'Heart Contains Tiger and Leopard' from the 'Tiger and Leopard True Classic'."

Zhou Shijie stepped forward to chat. "Brother, what a technique! It really opened my eyes! May I ask your name?"

The man said heartily, "My name is Yang Xiangtian." Zhou Shijie said, "Brother Yang, please come over here. I feel an instant friendship with you and would like to talk."

Wang Dezhong laughed. "Yes, Brother Yang is from the Thunder Gate. Speaking of which, our Jiushan Sword Sect has quite a close relationship with you."

Yang Xiangtian laughed loudly. "I would be delighted!" He saw that Wang Dezhong's "Iron Heart Sword Art" could make iron burn and the incense fire shoot straight into the sky. He felt his own method of lighting the incense was far inferior. If he tried to light the incense to catch the eye, he would likely fall into a lower class and be compared unfavorably. So he first "borrowed a light" from someone else, then found a different path, using his martial arts to create the strange image of "tiger and leopard carrying the incense."

It can be said that he avoided his weaknesses and showcased his strengths. Gu Nianjun was sharp-sighted and saw through this. She admired him even more. Avoiding weaknesses is not shameful. Knowing one's strengths and weaknesses is even more commendable.

Suddenly, the crowd cried out in surprise, followed by a charming shout: "Wow, it's so lively here, how could I not come and join in!" A beautiful woman used lightness skill, stepping on the heads of the common people as she flew over, and landed lightly in the center of the field.

The common people only felt a slight itch on their heads, and suddenly there was some mud. Then a gust of fragrant wind swept past. They were completely unaware of what had happened.

This woman had her long hair in braids, a pretty face, eyes like peach blossoms, slightly flushed cheeks, a straight and delicate nose, and slightly thin lips. She wore red clothes and black long boots, looking heroic, pretty, and lively. The moment she appeared, many young heroes looked over, secretly attracted.

Zhou Shijie smiled. "This heroic woman, please."

The woman raised her pretty eyebrows. "Of course." She placed the box containing the exotic incense on the ground. Then, with a tap of her toes, she leaped high into the air. Her graceful posture drew exclamations from the crowd. This woman was relatively young and loved to show off. This scene was just to her liking, but the lightness skill she displayed was excellent, already superior to many others.

She rose more than ten zhang high... Such "leaping" ability was truly rare and powerful. She shot several silver threads, nailing them into the special incense box. With a pull, the box opened, revealing the "Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense" inside.

Gu Nianjun, Zhou Shijie, and Li Xiaofan all smiled knowingly. The Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense, carried by its momentum, was precisely inserted into the incense burner. The woman in red floated down lightly, her toes touching the tip of the incense. With her boots, she lit the incense, using some unknown technique. Then she flipped back gracefully, white smoke accompanying her toes, drawing an arc in the air before landing steadily back in her original spot.

Everyone was dumbfounded and laughed. They all felt that this woman's intention to show off was a bit obvious, but her lightness skill was indeed excellent. And looking at her pretty appearance, no one felt annoyed for the moment.

The woman in red said, "Showing off clumsily." She cupped her fists to the crowd, her expression飞扬, extremely proud. Gu Nianjun smiled. "What a move, the Dragon Soars and Phoenix Leaps Step!"

The woman in red was delighted. "This big sister knows this move?" Gu Nianjun said, "Little sister should be from the Hushan Sword Sect, right?"

The woman in red smiled. "Correct. My name is Mu Hongchou."

Wang Dezhong laughed. "Miss Mu, my name is Wang Dezhong, from the Jiushan Sword Sect. In that case, we have quite a connection!" Mu Hongchou was delighted. Seeing that Wang Dezhong, Zhou Shijie, Gu Nianjun, Yang Xiangtian, Li Xiaofan, and the others were all extraordinary, she quickly walked over to chat and make friends.

This spot had become the center of the crowd.

Suddenly, at this moment, a dragon's roar and a phoenix's cry rang out together. The Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense had a unique material. When burned, it produced a strange phenomenon. Thick white smoke burst out, turning into a dragon and phoenix soaring and circling.

The setting sun shone upon them, making them look as if they were附着 with golden scales and red feathers. They were lifelike. The strange scene lingered for a long time, actually circling the Flying Dragon Temple. The onlookers were all astonished, as if witnessing a divine miracle. Some were stunned in shock, some knelt down and kowtowed...

Mu Hongchou, seeing this scene, clapped her hands in even greater joy. The bronze incense burner now had three exotic incenses inserted: the Eight-Nine Iron-Core Incense, the Jade Tablet Incense, and the Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense... The Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense had the most spectacular phenomenon.

The prodigies saw that Gu Nianjun and Mu Hongchou were beautiful and amiable, chatting happily with the surrounding prodigies. They were eager to show their abilities to join in and make friends, so as not to have come in vain.

People came one after another to ignite and insert their incenses... There were pretty women and handsome young men. They all exhausted their ingenuity on how to win applause and attract attention. Every time someone displayed an excellent ability, Gu Nianjun, Zhou Shijie, Wang Dezhong... and the others would politely greet them and have a friendly conversation.

If someone was particularly admirable, they would eagerly invite them to talk. In this way, a group of prodigies gathered around them, making friends and getting to know each other. They talked and laughed with learned scholars, and there were no uneducated people coming and going.

Li Xun hid in the crowd, never showing himself. Seeing the lively scenes and Gu Nianjun's politeness and grace in conversation with others, he thought, "So this woman is not inherently arrogant and looks down on me. When she meets peers from aristocratic families, she can also chat and make friends gracefully."

These young prodigies wore gorgeous clothes, burned exotic incenses, and displayed their unique skills. It was truly like gods interacting, as if they had accidentally wandered into a heavenly palace. Li Xiaofan remained silent and spoke little. Gu Nianjun took good care of him. Whenever a decent hero came, she would introduce him.

However, Li Xiaofan's interest in conversation was not high; he only maintained basic courtesy. The visiting prodigies and handsome men were all there for Gu Nianjun and Zhou Shijie. Seeing that Li Xiaofan, although fair and clean, wore ordinary clothes, they naturally paid little attention to him and gradually ignored him.

As more and more prodigies gathered, the grandeur was beyond words. Even though Gu Nianjun took care of Li Xiaofan, she couldn't protect him completely. Moreover, Li Xiaofan was determined to travel and study. He should be resilient and stand on his own; he was no longer a frightened fledgling.

Li Xiaofan saw Gu Nianjun's concern and smiled. "Sister Gu, it's rare for you to make friends. You don't have to look after me all the time." Gu Nianjun smiled. "Xiaofan, you are not familiar with this kind of scene. I really can't take care of everything, but if you follow behind me, you can still make a few acquaintances." She then devoted more energy to chatting with the young aristocrats.

Zhou Shijie held a folding fan, elegant and graceful. In this scene, he was like a fish in water, extremely comfortable. He was very good at quietly displaying his talents. Martial arts was not his strong point, but "fortune" was ethereal and special.

When other prodigies heard that he possessed fortune, they would look at him with new eyes and ask curiously. He would then speak eloquently, displaying his knowledge, which could convince people's hearts. It was truly extremely lively.

The large bronze incense burner was filled with exotic incenses. Strange phenomena appeared one after another: colorful clouds surrounded, a pure fragrance lingered, dragons and phoenixes danced, and golden light shone.

Yang Xiangtian said, "Oh, Miss Gu, Brother Zhou, Brother Li... it seems you haven't offered your incense yet?"

Zhou Shijie smiled. "Ah, I almost forgot! Truly a sin, a sin. Nianjun, why don't you go first?"

Gu Nianjun smiled. "Alright." She opened the special box, inside was the "Five-Five Even Incense." This incense was five feet and five inches long, with patterns that seemed square and flat, like a ruler and a scale. It symbolized constant self-reflection and having rules and edges inside.

Gu Nianjun had thought that incenses like the Ten Thousand Generations of Peace Incense and the Jade Tablet Incense... many magnificent and unique incenses, must have been purchased by others. She used this scene, but this exotic incense was to illuminate her own heart. To constantly measure herself with a ruler and weigh herself with a scale. First reflect on herself, then dare to ask the heavens and earth.

She smiled. "Nianjun has shallow skills. You all have displayed various techniques. I know I am inferior, so I won't show off clumsily. I'll just insert the incense directly." With that, she walked slowly forward, inserted the incense, lit the tip, and bowed three times.

The prodigies were slightly disappointed, expecting Gu Nianjun's skills and abilities. But they thought that people have different temperaments. Some simply don't like to show off. Moreover, everyone had witnessed Gu Nianjun's knowledge and demeanor. Her family background, when pondered, was quite astonishing. So they said no more.

Gu Nianjun smiled at Li Xiaofan. She had originally wanted to show off a bit, but thinking that Li Xiaofan hadn't practiced martial arts, and would have to walk up to offer the incense later. If she displayed her great abilities, leaving Xiaofan to look ordinary, it would be inappropriate. So she sacrificed the opportunity to show off and accompanied Xiaofan.

Li Xiaofan understood Gu Nianjun's thoughts and was very grateful, but felt it was unnecessary. Zhou Shijie used this opportunity to display himself to the fullest. He had purchased the "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix Incense." When burned, it attracted thousands of birds and beasts.

Zhou Shijie didn't hurry to offer the incense. First, he spoke passionately, reciting some poetry. He displayed his grand ambitions. He possessed fortune, and his words were quite infectious. His voice resonated in all directions, truly capable of convincing people.

His witty words flowed endlessly. For a moment, it seemed that those offering incense and paying respects were the pillars of the Great Wu, the new stars of the martial way, the outstanding talents of the world, and the heroes of the future... He praised himself and also praised everyone else, making them all feel认同.

He connected the act of offering incense with the heavens and earth. It was an act of establishing one's heart, will, and self. With his words, all the prodigies felt a sense of solemnity, feeling that this act was quite sacred.

After he finished speaking, he lit the incense, then played a tune called "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix." The smoke attracted birds and beasts, and he then played his tune to control the flock of birds. The birds carried the incense and inserted it into the bronze burner.

This act was similar to Yang Xiangtian's "tiger and leopard carrying the incense," and perhaps not as mystical. Zhou Shijie's "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix Tune," though deep in attainment, was not enough to attract a hundred birds to pay homage to the phoenix. He had to rely on the scent of the "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix Incense" to attract the birds first.

He then used his tune to control them. Combined with his passionate speech just now, it was quite different. For a moment, his popularity soared. No one noticed this detail. They all felt that Zhou Shijie had extraordinary knowledge and a fine demeanor; he was a rare and wonderful person. Their desire to make friends with him grew even stronger.

Praise poured in.

Zhou Shijie said, "You all flatter me. As for knowledge, Shijie is only half a scholar. I know a few clumsy martial arts, have read a few lines of poetry, and was lucky enough to gain a bit of fortune." He then said to Li Xiaofan, "Oh, Xiaofan, you're the only one left."

Everyone looked over. Li Xiaofan's expression was calm. He bowed to the crowd, opened the wooden box, and took out the "Guard the Heart and Awaken the Spirit Incense." Among all the exotic incenses, this one was the cheapest and shortest, and when burned, it produced no strange phenomena.

But it had the effect of guarding the heart and awakening the spirit. Li Xiaofan had thought at the time: "This incense is bought with Sister Gu's money. It's not good to be too expensive, and I'll find a way to pay her back later. Besides, although the other incenses look good when burned, they aren't very practical. This incense can help people awaken their spirits and guard their hearts. It won't be a complete waste to burn it."

So he chose this incense. Gu Nianjun had tried to persuade him several times, wanting him to buy some incense that would show his ambitions, like the "Ultimate Sage Seeking Truth Incense"... and so on. Li Xiaofan just smiled and insisted on using this incense.

Although this incense was considered exotic, its grade was rather low, and its body was only one foot long, short and plain. If this incense had been offered first, no one would have said anything. But later, after so many exotic incenses had displayed their splendor, it became gradually difficult to present.

Now, as the final act... it was too much of a letdown. All the prodigies' expressions changed slightly. They had thought that since Li Xiaofan was with Gu Nianjun and Zhou Shijie, the incense he prepared should not be bad. Who would have thought it would be so ordinary.

Moreover, Zhou Shijie had just given a high-flown speech, elevating this act of offering incense to the extreme. Everyone was hoping for a perfect ending, so as not to waste today's gathering. Looking back in the future, it would truly be a gathering of like-minded spirits.

The prodigies looked at each other and said, "This..." "This... well..." "Is it a bit inappropriate?" "This incense is too common. It's not very suitable to insert it into the bronze burner, is it?" "Not good, not good, little brother... maybe you shouldn't offer the incense?"

Many voices arose. Zhou Shijie sneered secretly, having expected this. He stood aside coldly, completely detached as if it were none of his business. Gu Nianjun frowned and said, "Everyone, Xiaofan is still young and doesn't know the rules here. Please don't hold it against him."

A prodigy from the Lishan Sword Sect said, "Miss Gu, this Xiaofan should be over ten years old, right? We have been learning etiquette since we were young. Ten years old is not small; he should understand the seriousness of the matter."

At that time, aristocratic families were numerous, and the descendants of these families placed great importance on etiquette. They had originally only considered offering incense as an act of worship and didn't care much about etiquette. But things gradually changed, taking on the meaning of making friends and forming circles. It was like a "banquet," where you give gifts to congratulate someone, and the final item is like silver.

Everyone was naturally displeased, feeling that if this incense were inserted, it would lower the grade. Someone asked again, "Brother Xiaofan, what is your identity, exactly? Miss Gu... who is he to you?"

Zhou Shijie smiled. "Xiaofan comes from an ordinary background. He was a hunter in his youth and passed the exam to enter the provincial academy to study. He and Nianjun are junior and senior martial sister and brother."

Everyone understood, and their gazes now carried a hint of contempt. Wang Dezhong said, "In that case, it's understandable that he doesn't know about friendship and etiquette."

Li Xiaofan silently put away the wooden box, his expression calm. He blew on a fire starter and lit the Guard the Heart and Awaken the Spirit Incense. But every time he was about to light it, a cold wind would blow it out. Someone was unwilling to let him insert the incense.

Gu Nianjun didn't want to spoil the atmosphere, but she also needed to protect Xiaofan. She said, "Everyone, although Xiaofan is not my biological brother, he is closer than one. This Guard the Heart and Awaken the Spirit Incense, in terms of specifications, is indeed inferior to the other exotic incenses. But it has its own merits. I hope you all won't be so obsessed with this."

With her guarantee, everyone fell silent. After Li Xiaofan lit the incense, he walked forward with it in both hands. Suddenly, he felt a hidden force hit his back. His whole body went numb, and he fell forward. The exotic incense in his hand flew high into the air.

Gu Nianjun frowned and quickly walked over, immediately helping Li Xiaofan up. Seeing that he was not seriously hurt, she was slightly relieved. But the "Guard the Heart and Awaken the Spirit Incense" had already flown elsewhere and was stepped on a few times.

Gu Nianjun felt very displeased. Although there were many famous orthodox sects today, there were inevitably some narrow-minded people. Gu Nianjun said, "Xiaofan, are you alright? Don't be sad. It's fine if you don't offer the incense." She saw that the Guard the Heart and Awaken the Spirit Incense was already stained with filth.

Li Xiaofan said calmly, "Sister Gu, I'm fine." He thought: "I don't want to force my way into your circle. You look down on me, and I don't care. To be honest, coming here to offer incense is just to go along with Sister Gu's wishes."

As he was speaking... a scream was suddenly heard: "Ouch!" A figure flew backward, its momentum fierce. After landing, it rolled several times, extremely disheveled.

Everyone looked closely. This person was the prodigy "Yue Kai" of the "Yueshan Sword Sect." His strength was quite formidable, so why was he in such a sorry state? Yue Kai had made a fool of himself and roared in anger: "Who! Who ambushed me?!"

A voice came from the crowd: "If someone doesn't know, it's only because they haven't done it themselves. What goes around comes around. The law of karma is never failing."

Yue Kai roared, "Mumbo jumbo! What karma? If you have the guts, come out and fight!"

Gu Nianjun already knew the reason. It must have been this Yue Kai who secretly used a trick to make Li Xiaofan fall. This act was noticed by another prodigy, who was displeased and出手 to punish him.

Gu Nianjun was very angry and said coldly, "Brother Yue, what you did was not very honorable. You must apologize to Xiaofan." Yue Kai, seeing his deed had been exposed, said awkwardly, "I just wanted to test if he had learned martial arts. I didn't expect him to be so frail."

"I'll apologize to Brother Xiaofan, but the incense is already dirty. There's nothing I can do about that."

Gu Nianjun felt a bit guilty. Just then, a thick white mist came blowing like a gale. The crowd cried out in alarm and scattered. The prodigies were on guard, looking around. The voice sounded again:

"You all call yourselves prodigies, but in the end, you are just a bunch of fame-seekers. You don't allow common incense to be inserted, but I insist on inserting it."

Everyone shouted curses, but they had no idea where the mist came from. After a moment of chaos, the white mist cleared completely. Suddenly, they saw a three-inch common incense already inserted in the bronze burner. Though short and plain, it was very conspicuous.

Everyone's expressions turned ugly.

Gu Nianjun's face showed a strange color. She thought, "Among these prodigies, there is one with quite a temper, an unconventional character." She suddenly saw that the "Guard the Heart and Awaken the Spirit Incense" on the ground was bright and clean as new.

She felt even more that this person was extraordinary. Their methods were unpredictable, as fierce as a gale, yet meticulous. Gu Nianjun said, "Xiaofan, go offer your incense quickly!"

Li Xiaofan nodded and went to offer the incense. No one dared to obstruct him anymore, secretly wondering who had done it just now. The many exotic incenses shone on each other, but that strand of common incense was even more conspicuous.

Gu Nianjun thought: "This prodigy is quite extraordinary. It's rare to meet such a wonderful person; I really want to make friends with him. But if I ask for his name, I will offend many other prodigies, and that prodigy might not agree. I suppose... he must be one of the many prodigies here. Because he doesn't want to reveal his identity, he acted so secretly. I can look for him after this is over."

Her beautiful eyes looked around, secretly paying attention to several prodigies.

Just then, the abbot of the Flying Dragon Temple walked over and said with a laugh, "Hahaha, today's temple fair is truly extremely lively. If you are all interested, please come into the main hall. Madam Wang will also be offering incense to the Buddha."

The prodigies said one after another, "Madam Wang? Which Madam Wang? Could it be the wife of City Lord He of Flying Dragon City?" "Brother, don't speak nonsense. I arrived a bit earlier and heard of Madam Wang's name. This woman is truly a remarkable person! I heard she is as beautiful as a fairy and very generous!"

"Very generous? How generous, please tell us in detail." "In short... I came to this temple fair mainly to see Madam Wang's true appearance. Finally, I can see her. Let's go into the hall first!"

The prodigies entered the hall first, followed by the common people. The gate of the Three Saints Hall was six zhang and eight chi wide and nine zhang and seven chi high. Inside, it was truly carved with beams and painted rafters, with jade bricks and brilliant golden light.

Li Xun followed the crowd into the hall. He looked toward the center, wanting to see Madam Wang's true appearance.

Suddenly, there was a *thud*, and the heavy hall gate closed. The hall plunged into darkness. The crowd was in an uproar. Li Xun felt a strange sensation, but he couldn't explain it clearly.

Candlesticks lit up one after another. A woman walked out from the side hall.
