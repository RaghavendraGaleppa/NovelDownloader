# Chapter 34: The Visit  

Before Li Shiming could visit Gu Jia, on the morning of the third day, Mo Yan delivered an invitation to him.  

Seeing the name "Royal Attendant Gu Jia" on the invitation, Li Shiming immediately instructed Steward Zhang to open the main gate wide while he hurried out to greet the guest.  

"Greetings, Daoist Brother!" Sure enough, standing outside the gate was Gu Jia, the same man who had stopped his carriage that day. Li Shiming bowed respectfully.  

Gu Jia had come alone, still dressed in his plain blue Daoist robe, looking utterly unremarkable.  

As for how Gu Jia had found him here, Li Shiming wasn’t surprised in the least. With the ability to mobilize royal resources, finding someone within the capital—or even across the entire Great Xia—would be effortless for Gu Jia.  

"Little Friend Li, we meet again!" Gu Jia nodded with a smile.  

Li Shiming ushered Gu Jia into the main hall and dismissed all the servants.  

"Little Friend Li, the investigation into your background has been completed. Your cultivation origins and history are verifiable," Gu Jia announced as soon as they sat down.  

The Great Xia’s intelligence network was far more thorough than Li Shiming had imagined. Every event, big or small, that had occurred in Nanling Prefecture had been compiled by specialists and stored in the capital.  

Gu Jia had retrieved intelligence reports from Nanling Prefecture covering the past few months. By cross-referencing Li Shiming’s account with the recorded events, he had verified every detail.  

In particular, the ancestors of the Weiyuan Escort Agency had indeed produced a cultivator who returned to the mortal world, left descendants, and passed down a cultivation legacy—none of which was unusual.  

According to the reports, Chief Escort Wang of Weiyuan had been pursued by a cultivator and had hidden in the Nanling Prefectural garden. Li Shiming had fortuitously obtained the cultivation legacy Wang had concealed.  

Later, two fellow cultivators had undertaken a mission together—one died, and the other left Nanling injured. This incident had also been confirmed through the sect’s records.  

It could only be said that Li Shiming had extraordinary luck. After obtaining the cultivation technique, he had also acquired the resources—spirit stones—needed for cultivation.  

Gu Jia wasn’t particularly interested in the legacy Li Shiming had obtained, as it was merely the inheritance of a rogue cultivator. Compared to the minor benefits of such a legacy, he valued Li Shiming’s future potential far more.  

"Daoist Brother, does this mean I can join the Tianhai Sect?" Li Shiming pressed eagerly upon hearing the news.  

"Haha, with your clean background and origins within the sect’s sphere of influence, joining won’t be a problem," Gu Jia assured him confidently.  

Li Shiming’s heart swelled with joy. If not for the Ascension Assembly being scheduled for next autumn, he would have abandoned the imperial examinations altogether.  

"Hmm, this tea of yours is rather special," Gu Jia remarked with surprise after taking a sip, momentarily distracted by the taste.  

As a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator, Gu Jia would normally have dismissed Li Shiming’s tea leaves. However, the spiritual water used to brew it had been produced through the *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain* technique. While he might have access to better resources within the sect, here in the mortal world, such spiritual water was exceedingly precious.  

Stationed in the capital, Gu Jia received a monthly stipend of spirit stones from the sect, but daily necessities had to be purchased during periodic returns to the sect.  

"Daoist Brother has a discerning palate. This was made using the *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain* technique," Li Shiming admitted freely, smiling.  

Whether it was the imitation spirit tea or the spiritual water used to brew it, Gu Jia would have deduced their origins after investigating his background. It was better to be forthright—it might even earn him favor when joining the sect.  

"You’ve actually mastered *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain*?" Gu Jia was genuinely surprised.  

The technique wasn’t particularly powerful, but its uniqueness lay in being an introductory spell for spirit farmers.  

He surmised that the legacy left by the Weiyuan ancestor must have been a spirit farmer’s inheritance. It wasn’t an unreasonable assumption—he couldn’t possibly imagine Li Shiming having obtained a second legacy in the mortal world.  

With that, any lingering interest he had in the legacy vanished. Even if he had obtained the spirit farmer’s inheritance, he would still need the corresponding talent to master it.  

"I had no choice. It took me quite some time to learn *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain*," Li Shiming said, feigning helplessness.  

"Little Friend, once you enter the sect, you’ll realize how crucial it is to master even one of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation. It will ease many of the hardships on your path," Gu Jia said with a smile.  

He now held Li Shiming’s future in even higher regard. With this skill, Li Shiming would have a more stable foundation in the Qi Refining stage compared to other cultivators.  

Only those who had experienced it understood just how vital stability was in the cultivation world.  

Gu Jia thought of many fellow disciples he had known—those with greater talent and strength than his own—who had ultimately perished during missions, becoming mere footnotes in history.  

Had he not possessed a skill that reduced the number of dangerous missions he undertook, he wouldn’t have survived this long either.  

"Here’s the location for the cultivators' market. It opens three times a month. Since the Ascension Assembly will be held here next year, many cultivators will gather, and the market will likely see an influx of participants. You might even find some rare treasures.  

"However, you must be cautious when visiting the market. Conceal your identity well," Gu Jia said, placing a map before Li Shiming.  

This was his investment in Li Shiming. The market catered primarily to rogue cultivators at the Qi Refining stage, and Gu Jia frequented it himself.  

Of course, items that would catch the eye of a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator like him were exceedingly rare in such a market. Instead, he often sold unused items there.  

Most of the market’s visitors were early or mid-stage Qi Refining rogue cultivators, with the latter being relatively few in number.  

The market’s existence was tied to the Tianhai Sect’s stationed cultivators. Operating under the sect’s name, the stationed cultivators earned extra income from it.  

Items flowing out from sect disciples were particularly sought after by rogue cultivators hoping to stumble upon something valuable.  

By introducing Li Shiming to this market, Gu Jia hoped to expose him to the wider cultivation world. The market was relatively safe, making it ideal for a Qi Refining novice like Li Shiming.  

"Daoist Brother’s generosity is unmatched. As a token of gratitude, I’ve prepared some water collected using *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain*. Since it pleases you, please accept it," Li Shiming said, storing the map and presenting a large jar of spiritual water he had prepared earlier.  

He had initially intended to include the imitation spirit tea, but Gu Jia had shown no interest in it.  

"Then I shall accept it without further refusal!" Gu Jia chuckled, storing the jar of spiritual water without hesitation.  

Though the spiritual water wasn’t particularly valuable, it was practical for Gu Jia. Given Li Shiming’s status and strength, even producing such water was beyond expectations.
