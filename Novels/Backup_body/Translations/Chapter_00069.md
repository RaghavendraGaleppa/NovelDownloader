# Chapter 69: You've Finally Arrived... My Creditor!

"No anesthesia?"  

Hearing the heavily emphasized last sentence, the strange old man finally seemed somewhat satisfied and nodded.  

Meanwhile, the wall-climbing bird quietly fluttered to Li Zhengjing's ear.  

"Master, my literary skills are no match for yours, and my ability to twist black and white is far from your level of mastery."  

"If you can't do it, you're dead. Your call."  

Li Zhengjing remained expressionless as he plucked the bird off his shoulder.  

The Five Elements Creation Tree shrank back, trembling and not daring to speak.  

The old man muttered about killing that "bastard," growing angrier by the second, his aura intensifying.  

The man, the tree, and the bird all began to tremble.  

"Senior! The text... the text is here..."  

Li Zhengjing quickly pointed to the altar.  

Only then did the old man seem to snap out of it, rubbing his head as his anger dissipated. Still grumbling about the "bastard," he leaned forward to examine the writing.  

Silence once again filled the temple.  

In this oppressive stillness, every second felt excruciatingly long, as if they were being roasted over flames.  

"Senior..." The wall-climbing bird couldn't hold back any longer and whispered.  

"Huh?" The old man jumped, looking confused. "Who are you three?"  

"..." Li Zhengjing took a deep breath. "Senior, you mentioned earlier that you were going to read the text..."  

"Oh, oh, right! Almost forgot. I've been running around too much lately, no rest—feeling a bit drowsy."  

The old man squinted at the altar for a long while.  

Afraid he might doze off again, Li Zhengjing quietly prompted him.  

"This is one of the official scripts from the early Great Zhou Dynasty, dating back to its founding!"  

The old man stroked his beard, deep in thought.  

"At that time, the Great Zhou court had just pacified the Central Plains, unifying the various regional languages and scripts. So, this ancient script is rarely understood by the younger generation nowadays! To decipher it, you actually need to understand its connection to modern writing. For example—"  

The Five Elements Creation Tree retreated into the phoenix wood box.  

The wall-climbing bird stared blankly at Li Zhengjing.  

Li Zhengjing remained outwardly composed, but inwardly he was cursing.  

"This old man's style is exactly like that damned golden page that cuts off mid-sentence—always leaving out the key points, just toying with me!"  

He took another deep breath, forced a smile, and pointed at the first line.  

"Senior, what does this line say?"  

"This line? Let me see..."  

The old man squinted and read aloud, word by word.  

*"I awaken from slumber, sensing my lifespan nearing its end. Reflecting on my life, I find it filled with regrets—utterly tragic."*  

Just as Li Zhengjing was about to point to the next passage, the old man seemed to regain some coherence and continued reading.  

*"Through secret techniques, I preserved my vitality during this slumber, slowing the passage of time to extend my life by three hundred years. Yet now, I stand at the brink of death."*  

*"Since the Heavenly Azure Daoist three thousand years ago, no one has ascended to immortality. I have heard that even his tomb fell into the hands of the Golden Ship of Salvation."*  

*"Perhaps there were never any gods or immortals beyond the Nine Heavens."*  

*"Transcendence may have been nothing but a grand illusion—an ancient cultivator’s desperate hope in the face of death, which later became the ultimate pursuit of generations to come."*  

*"Now, as I emerge from seclusion, I harbor no grand ambitions. I only wish to wander this world in my final days, to witness the Great Zhou Dynasty—the empire I once devoted my life to—and see what kind of golden age it has become."*  

*"No era is without its shadows. Though the Great Zhou has its flaws, it is, by and large, a prosperous realm. As its first Imperial Preceptor, I find myself content with the state of the world."*  

Here, the old man paused, scratching his head in confusion.  

He turned to Li Zhengjing, bewildered.  

"The first Imperial Preceptor of the Great Zhou? I think I know him... But this 'Heavenly Azure Daoist' mentioned earlier sounds even more familiar. Just hearing the name feels... warm."  

Then his expression darkened with rage.  

"But what the hell is this 'Golden Ship of Salvation'? Just hearing it makes me furious—I want to kill someone!"  

He raised a hand, and the entire temple trembled. Tiles rained down from the ceiling.  

The wall-climbing bird shrieked and dove headfirst into the phoenix wood box.  

Li Zhengjing stumbled back a dozen steps, shouting, "Senior! There's more text! Keep reading!"  

The old man's murderous aura froze.  

After a moment of silence, as if deep in thought, he looked up and asked, "Where was I?"  

Li Zhengjing cautiously stepped forward and pointed to the middle section.  

"You've read up to here. The next part starts from this line..."  

The old man nodded and resumed reading.  

*"Twelve years ago, Mount Fengdu in the north collapsed, unleashing a million malevolent spirits. The Great Zhou court, alongside various sects, suppressed the calamity. Afterward, the chaos was quelled, and the source of the corruption was sealed. The Twin Nine Cities were established to monitor the northern lands."*  

*"Remembering an old friend, I journeyed north and arrived here, only to find this temple in ruins, its divine effigy shattered."*  

*"The nine great deities who once guarded the northern lands have all perished, along with countless mortals, beneath the onslaught of the malevolent horde."*  

*"My old friend is gone. My heart grieves."*  

*"Reflecting on the past, I am filled with regret. As I near the end of my life, I resolve to leave behind a legacy for the world."*  

*"With my waning lifespan, I shall venture to the ruins of Mount Fengdu and, with this aged body, suppress the source of corruption!"*  

The old man stopped again, lost in thought.  

Li Zhengjing sighed.  

"The source of corruption beneath Mount Fengdu—even the Great Zhou court, the three immortal sects, Buddhist temples, and other Daoist factions combined couldn't subdue it. Yet this Imperial Preceptor was willing to sacrifice himself to suppress it... Truly admirable."  

But given the overwhelming miasma still billowing from the north, it was clear the first Imperial Preceptor of the Great Zhou had failed five years ago.  

The wall-climbing bird poked its head out of the box and sighed.  

"What a sage-like figure! The senior here seems lost in thought, surely moved by the Imperial Preceptor's noble sacrifice. Maybe he won't go berserk again?"  

"Bah! What 'nine great deities guarding the north'?"  

The old man suddenly snarled.  

"They were nothing but a bunch of false gods clinging to life! They couldn’t even escape—just died here!"  

He jabbed a finger at the altar and roared,  

"You frauds dare call yourselves gods? I’ve seen real gods! Yes... I’ve seen real gods! Hahaha—"  

His laughter turned maniacal as he suddenly slammed a palm onto the altar!  

**BOOM!**  

The altar shattered into dust.  

Li Zhengjing grabbed the phoenix wood box and leapt back a dozen steps, nearly clearing the temple grounds—  

But then, from the settling ashes, a flash of light coalesced into a human figure stepping forth.  

"I knew you'd lose your temper and destroy the altar after reading this."  

The figure, hazy and indistinct, chuckled. Its gaze bypassed the mad old man entirely, locking onto Li Zhengjing with unmistakable killing intent.  

**"You've finally arrived... my creditor."**
