# Chapter 218: Piercing the Armor

Zhan Yan’s face carried a hint of emotion. "A common man is innocent, but possessing a treasure is a crime. It was ultimately a path to death. Thirty years ago, when Disaster befell the Divine Weapon Ridge, that person came here upon hearing rumors from who knows where.

"This news is only passed down from Sect Master to Sect Master. If not for the urgency of the situation back then, I wouldn't have known that the Divine Weapon Ridge actually had a true divine armor hidden deep underground..."

Xu Yunfan was extremely envious. This was a close-fitting armor; the layered scales would surely fit his entire body, allowing for unimpeded movement.

This dragon scale soft armor exuded a dark golden luster. The scale armor actually breathed like a living creature, and at every seam, the "Heavenly Work Buckles," secret techniques of the Divine Weapon Ridge’s forging platform, were embedded.

He recognized this technique. There were related forging methods in the Heavenly Work Forging Technique that allowed armor to stretch and contract with muscle and bone, fitting and wrapping around the entire body.

Zhan Yan turned back to look at Xu Yunfan, then glanced at the玄钢 (mysterious steel) mechanical case behind Xu Yunfan that concealed the鎏金 mace.

His heart stirred slightly, and he spoke: "Within this dragon scale armor lies the Six Strategies of Divine Weapons hidden by the ancestor Ouyezi. They were derived from observing the battles of a hundred weapons,悟出 (enlightening) the essential formulas of 'Spear Challenging a Thousand Armies,' 'Halberd Sweeping the Eight Wastelands,' 'Axe Splitting Mountains,' 'Yue Suppressing Evil Spirits,' 'Hook Locking Dragon Veins,' and 'Hammer Shaking City Gates.' Relying on this, one can intimidate the world's weapons and control a hundred weapons. If you can learn them, you might be able to truly control this precious armor... Do you want to try?"

Xu Yunfan’s expression turned solemn.

"Before such a divine weapon, this disciple naturally wants to try."

"Remove the chains first."

Zhan Yan nodded slightly, saying no more. He stepped back a few paces, giving Xu Yunfan space, his eyes constantly scanning the surroundings to prevent any accidents.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan naturally did not hesitate. A breath arrow, clearly visible to the naked eye, rolled out of his throat, dispersing the scorching heat rushing at his face.

He took off the weapon case on his body and tore off his clothes. Wearing only the vest from the Extreme Path Remnant Body and a pair of close-fitting shorts, Xu Yunfan opened the Ginseng Spirit's mysterious steel case and took a deep breath of ginseng qi.

Xu Yunfan's face instantly flushed red. Ignoring the Ginseng Spirit's angry little eyes, he closed the case and staggered forward.

The rich ginseng qi turned into a scorching heat like molten rock within his body, flowing ceaselessly between his muscles, bones, and skin. The Red Serpent Mountain-Carrying Strength moved with the flow, circulating through his entire body. The pure yang internal breath remained endless, constantly transforming along with his vigorous vital energy, turning into Red Serpent Strength.

He walked slowly towards the nine-foot high platform, looking at the dragon scale armor locked tightly by countless tiny chains.

Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath, his feet forming the Red Serpent Mountain-Carrying Stance,钉入 (nailing into) the stone platform.

The moment the breath arrow in his throat broke through the scorching waves, the sound of thirty-six vertebrae grinding echoed from his chest. His skin had already turned a mysterious steel color; the Hundred-Refined Mysterious Steel Body had been pushed to its limit.

His left hand's five fingers suddenly clenched, and the knuckles pressed three sonic booms in the air—the starting stance of the Thousand-Jun Hammer Shaking Mountain, the Wave-Crashing Mountain Collapse.

Xu Yunfan flicked a finger at the chains on the scale armor.

*Zheng!*

The vibration of the Three-Tiered Waves was transmitted along the chains to the dragon scale armor. All 1,720 inverted scales emitted a buzzing sound like gold foil vibrating.

"Rise!"

As the breath arrow in his throat tore through the scorching heat waves, Xu Yunfan formed his five fingers into a fist and slammed it into the space seven inches in front of him.

The sonic boom caused by the friction between the palm edge and the air actually straightened three chains as if they were spears.

"What a Red Serpent Mountain-Carrying Strength!"

Zhan Yan's pupils contracted. He saw Xu Yunfan's back muscles flowing like magma, the unique color of the Hundred-Refined Mysterious Steel Body spreading from his spine to his entire body. This was a sign of pushing external training techniques to the extreme.

When the ninth sound of knocking rang out, the chains surrounding the armor let out a mournful cry.

Thirteen chains snapped simultaneously. Xu Yunfan took the opportunity to spin and cut in, his back making full contact with the dragon scale armor for the first time.

The 1,720 inverted scales instantly rolled up, but were blocked by the Hundred-Refined Mysterious Steel Body he had circulated in advance,卡住 (stuck) in the biting gaps.

When Xu Yunfan's spine completely fitted into the groove of the armor's back plate, the inverted scales suddenly split and reorganized.

Three serrated sub-plates弹出 (sprang out) from the edge of each dragon scale,最终 (eventually) forming 1,720 finely interlocking dark golden scale leaves.

*Crack!*

The neck armor and shoulder locking buckle tightened automatically. Twelve groups of fish-scale-like overlapping plates slid down along the texture of the trapezius muscle.

Xu Yunfan clearly felt that the scales at his carotid artery were the thinnest. This was a hollow structure designed specifically to配合 (cooperate) with the throat movement of the "Red Serpent Mountain-Carrying Strength." When he swallowed his saliva, three crescent-shaped throat guards actually moved up and down with it.

No wonder Master asked him to try...

This armor could only unleash its maximum power by practicing the Thousand-Jun Hammer Shaking Mountain and possessing extremely雄厚 (vigorous) Red Serpent Mountain-Carrying Strength.

A mechanical biting vibration came from the right shoulder blade bone. Seven layers of ring-shaped overlapping plates rotated and locked along the groove of the triceps muscle.

The inner wall of each scale leaf had fine file teeth. The heat generated by friction with the Hundred-Refined Mysterious Steel Body正好 (just right) stimulated the continuous升腾 (rising) of blood energy in his body.

Xu Yunfan tried to bend his elbow and found that the scales at the elbow joint grew in reverse. The friction sound of the scales during flexion and extension暗合 (tacitly agreed) with the breathing rhythm of the sixth style of the Thousand-Jun Hammer Shaking Mountain.

The most exquisite part was the design of the waist armor.

Thirty-six curved main plates构成 (formed) a retractable abdominal cage. When he breathed, the gaps between the plates automatically expanded by half an inch,留出 (leaving) space for the violent起伏 (fluctuation) of his diaphragm.

The inner side of the leg armor was covered with honeycomb-like凹痕 (dents). As Xu Yunfan lifted his leg and shook it, the airflow passing through these grooves发出 (emitted) a whistling sound like a low growl of a red serpent.

When the last foot plate locked onto the scaphoid position, Xu Yunfan found two movable scales embedded at the position of the Yongquan acupoint on the sole of his foot.

Whenever he stepped on the ground to exert force, these two dragon scales would move up and down like pistons, passing the ground's recoil force through the arch of the foot layer by layer,直送 (directly sending) it to his arms. This was exactly the spiral strength he had always lacked when practicing the final move, "Ten Thousand Mountains Paying Homage to the Ancestor," of the Thousand-Jun Hammer Shaking Mountain!

From a distance, Xu Yunfan was covered in countless dark golden scale leaves. When he raised his hands and moved his feet, one could clearly see his muscles bulging and the scales opening and closing.

Seeing this scene, Zhan Yan's expression was both surprised and delighted. He really didn't expect Xu Yunfan to directly wear this divine armor.

"How is it?"

Just as Xu Yunfan was about to answer Zhan Yan's question, his expression suddenly changed.

Before Zhan Yan's words had faded, Xu Yunfan's spine suddenly arched like a shrimp.

Eight hundred dragon scale leaves turned inward, revealing thousands of gold threads. They seemed like living creatures钻入 (drilling into) the vital acupoints of his entire body. They were as细 (thin) as西域 (Western Regions) ice silkworms spinning silk, yet they发出 (emitted) a sound of gold and jade colliding when刺入 (piercing) his body.

Xu Yunfan's eyes turned blood-red. Three feet of red mist喷出 (sprayed out) from the pores of his entire body. This armor was强抽 (forcibly extracting) the武者 (martial artist's) vital energy to nourish itself!

So it was waiting for him here.

The vital energy that was originally about to沉寂 (quiet down) was激 (stimulated) like this,仿佛 (as if) an地火 (underground fire erupting), causing an地动山摇 (earth-shaking) commotion inside his body.

Watching Xu Yunfan's swaying body, Zhan Yan's face changed abruptly. Just as he was about to step forward, he felt an unimaginable high temperature suddenly erupt from Xu Yunfan's body, even three parts hotter than the thunder-fire furnace in the Heavenly Work Cave.

"Yunfan!"
