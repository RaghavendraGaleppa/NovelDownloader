# Chapter 177: Big Brother Makes His Move

Moments later, another person approached the lotus, but it was merely a Great Emperor. Upon seeing the Heavenly Kings in the sky, his expression changed, and he was about to leave, but he was a step too slow.

Boom!

Thunder exploded in the sky. A Heavenly King vanished from his spot, reappearing with the Great Emperor in his hand. The Great Emperor was now surrounded by lightning, his body twitching uncontrollably.

The Thunder Heavenly King appeared above the flower bud and coldly threw the Great Emperor down. Immediately, several vine whips extended from the flower bud, emerald green and lustrous, like freshly sprouted tender shoots, but they fiercely pierced into the Great Emperor's body.

From deep within the emerald green vine whips, a thread of blood extended towards the flower bud. In a short while, the Great Emperor's body withered, turning directly into dust as all his vital blood was drawn out.

At the same time, the flower bud's blooming speed seemed to accelerate.

Zhou Tian clicked his tongue in wonder. As expected of the Heavenly Demon Buddha's primordial treasure, it was truly bizarre.

"This thing must be watered with blood to accelerate its growth. Fellow Daoists, don't hold back. Take out whatever you have. Every moment of delay adds a variable," the Thunder Heavenly King said, subtly glancing at Saint Demon as he spoke, then continued, "If we wait for those two Dao Lord-level seniors to arrive, there won't be anything left for us here."

Everyone fell silent for a moment upon hearing the Thunder Heavenly King's words. Then, a Heavenly King stood up and said, "What Fellow Daoist says is absolutely right. I have half the corpse of a Heavenly King-level Ferocious Ox here, which can assist Fellow Daoist."

As he spoke, a bloody, massive corpse suddenly appeared in the void. It had been cut in half, its internal organs spilling out, and its blood contained faint golden substances.

Whoosh!

A vine whip shot out from the flower bud, as if sensing the immense vital energy, wrapped around the Ferocious Ox's body, and fiercely pulled it over. Then, more vine whips emerged, sucking the blood like leeches.

The flower bud's blooming speed visibly accelerated. The other Heavenly Kings also contributed, having trained near the First Mountain, they had no shortage of such corpses.

Saint Demon also took out a complete Red Flood Dragon carcass, as Zhou Tian had a share in it.

Several Heavenly King-level ferocious beast carcasses were placed above the flower bud. The vine whips densely entwined them. The flower bud bloomed at a visible pace, emitting a seven-colored radiance, and a fragrant aroma diffused into the air.

Everyone waited quietly. These beast carcasses were already sufficient. This lotus was not a true primordial treasure, but merely a projection, its power limited. If it were the Heavenly Demon Buddha's true lotus seat, perhaps none of the Heavenly Kings present could withstand a single vine whip.

It was already incredibly rare for it to brew a lotus seed over countless eons, and its absorption speed was limited. There were already one or two corpses not entangled by the vine whips.

"The lotus seed in that flower bud is of great use to me," Saint Demon secretly transmitted to Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian nodded.

"When it fully blooms, you must help me obtain it. Can you still use your wondrous divine ability?"

Zhou Tian nodded.

"Good. When the time comes, you help me hold them off. As long as I get that lotus seed, I can almost instantly become a Dao Lord."

Zhou Tian nodded again.

"Why aren't you speaking?" Saint Demon asked, frowning.

"I don't know how to use sound transmission techniques…" Zhou Tian shrugged helplessly and said aloud.

Saint Demon: "..."

As night fell, the blood rain arrived as scheduled, but this lotus did not absorb the blood rain; it simply flowed down its leaves.

There were no bloody creatures near the lotus, which saved a lot of trouble, though these Heavenly Kings weren't afraid anyway.

Only Zhou Tian felt a pang of regret, as his resurrection count for the day was about to be wasted. He didn't know when the flower bud would fully bloom. It was already almost half open. Through the seven-colored light at its center, he could see a pitch-black lotus seed floating within—it had been golden during the day.

He couldn't just abandon Saint Demon to go find a place to seek death, could he? What if the lotus seed emerged the moment he left? Wouldn't that screw things up?

Time passed, minute by minute. The flower bud opened more and more. Several beast corpses had already turned to dust. The seven-colored light became fainter, and the lotus seed grew clearer. Although the lotus was immense, the lotus seed itself was only thumb-sized.

All the Heavenly Kings held their breath, completely focused, afraid of missing the optimal moment.

Finally, radiance surged, various symbols of order emerged, and faintly, the echoing sound of the Grand Dao resounded. The flower bud fully bloomed, and the entire lotus emitted light, becoming increasingly ethereal. Both tangible and intangible essence flowed towards the lotus seed; all its vitality was absorbed by the lotus seed.

A lotus seed radiating brilliant light flowed with splendor, releasing the aura of the Grand Dao. The sight was astonishing.

The flower bud erupted with green light, shining brilliantly, and thousands of ribbon-like beams of light draped down, enveloping itself.

The flower bud's final moment had arrived; it was about to fully open.

In an instant, there was a surge of flowing light and vibrant colors. Dense, countless symbols materialized into phantoms of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and even Rakshasas and evil spirits. The sound of the Grand Dao grew even grander and deafening.

Numerous phenomena also appeared on the lotus seed, and even inexplicable scenes emerged: a battlefield, corpses strewn everywhere, and massive chains lying across the ground. Everyone's minds reeled. This seemed to be a scene left over from ancient times.

Only Zhou Tian was thoughtful. This might be a scene from the battle between the Heavenly Demon Buddha and Bianyu, inscribed onto the lotus seed. Now that the lotus seed was emerging, the imprint was triggered, thus displaying the scene.

"Get ready," Saint Demon instructed, runes surging around him, his hair fluttering, his eyes shining brightly. A long sword appeared in his hand, and he stared intently at the lotus seed, his hand trembling. He could already feel that his opportunity for Dao attainment lay within that lotus seed.

"Don't worry, if they want to touch you, they'll have to step over my corpse!" Zhou Tian declared passionately, showing a willingness to brave mountains of blades and seas of fire for Saint Demon.

The lotus seed switched between gold and black, shaking violently. Anomalies appeared around it: Buddhas and Rakshasas battling, Buddhist chants shaking the ears, and demonic energy permeating the air.

All the Heavenly Kings were ready. Thunder galloped across the sky, a massive divine sword began to form, its sharp aura making people's skin tingle.

The lotus seed had reached its final moment. The giant lotus had already vanished. Finally, all the anomalies on the lotus seed converged into chaos. The lotus seed turned a primordial chaos color, completely mature.

Saint Demon instantly vanished from his spot, as did the other Heavenly Kings. And as if by telepathy, three of them headed directly for Saint Demon, while the other four charged towards Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian, meanwhile, immediately used his [Cultivation Copy] skill on Saint Demon.

Energy erupted. Thunder dragons, scarlet phoenixes, qilins, and phantoms of myriad spirits surged around Zhou Tian. His black hair was radiant and lustrous. He smiled slightly and said, "Everyone, do you know why I'm his big brother?"
