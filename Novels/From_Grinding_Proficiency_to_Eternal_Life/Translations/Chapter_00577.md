# Chapter 577: Gentlemen, Enter the Banner

The silver dress of the cold moon and frost completely turned to ash, revealing a scorched magical body. The black hair turned to dust inch by inch. The soul struggled as it was forcibly stripped away, and in a piercing, desperate shriek, it was cast into the banner. The lingering chill of the Ice Soul寒气 surrounding it was also greedily devoured.

Sun Qishan struggled the most violently, but his shattered, severely injured body was like a dying candle in the wind.

The knotted muscles on his body peeled away like melting wax. Thick, viscous Blood Fiend essence, mixed with spiritual essence and the essence of flesh and blood, formed a dark red torrent. Together with his roaring, howling, and boundless savage and resentful giant soul shadow, it was all mercilessly devoured by the Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

The bones and flesh of the three melted away. Their essence, blood, and magical power were all devoured. Their souls were forcibly stripped and imprisoned, and without any power to resist, they were entirely absorbed by the pitch-black Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

The banner trembled violently once, as if a glutted ferocious beast had let out a loud belch.

On the surface of the banner, among the countless dark green specks of light, three new stars suddenly appeared.

One was dark in color, faintly shimmering with the luster of black jade. One radiated an icy blue aura of death. The last one was as red as fire, with an aura of viciousness soaring to the heavens.

Seeing this scene, a smile couldn't help but appear on Xu Yunfan's face. He casually picked up the storage bags of the three and glanced at them before paying them no more attention.

Compared to the wealth left by Chu Chengnan, these three were considered poor.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. Once all 365 stars are gathered, the Zodiac Starfall Great Array can be deployed. Now, three Foundation Establishment cultivators have entered to become Star Lords.

Hmm, a thousand-foot tower rises from the ground. It's a start.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan felt a bit of regret for having killed Nezha too carelessly before. If he had thrown that person's soul into the Zodiac Star Soul Banner, this soul banner could have grown even stronger.

The three new stars, the moment they were imprinted onto the banner's surface, were bound by the banner's own stellar secret power. They began to undergo the erosion of resentment and evil spirits, as well as the initial refinement by the banner's master.

Their consciousness still existed, but they had completely sunk into oblivion, becoming new divine soldiers and generals in this Zodiac Star Soul Banner. They no longer had a self, simply waiting to be refined and commanded by the banner's master.

The air still held the foul stench of scorched flesh, evaporating污血, and dissipating magical power.

Inside the valley, aside from the Five Thunders Inverse Array Locking Heaven Formation, which was still rotating and contracting but whose lightning had grown dim, there was only a field of scorched marks and stains in disarray.

The auras of the three Foundation Establishment True Persons had completely vanished from this world.

Xu Yunfan retracted his gaze and made a beckoning gesture.

*Hum!*

The cyan-purple formation plate that supported the Locking Heaven Formation dimmed its light and flew back into his palm, feeling warm to the touch.

The luster on the surface of the formation plate was noticeably much dimmer, and there were many fine cracks on it. Evidently, the previous burst had consumed a great deal of power. If it were used once more, the formation plate would surely be damaged on the spot.

But to have such an effect, Xu Yunfan was quite satisfied.

To refine a reusable formation plate requires extremely rare heavenly treasures and materials, which he does not have on hand.

He glanced at the Zodiac Star Soul Banner in his hand, which was still trembling slightly. A clear halo rippled within it, and black qi poured out in great volume, yet a vast stellar light surged like a sea, constantly baptising the three Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"Not bad."

Xu Yunfan gave a rather satisfied evaluation.

Inside the banner, Zhang Ziyang couldn't help but interject, "How is this 'not bad'? I have been carefully studying the Zodiac Star Soul Banner these past few days, Yunfan, I'm afraid there are some areas that need improvement."

As he spoke, Zhang Ziyang immediately offered many suggestions, concluding, "If you could erase their memories while leaving their self-awareness, it might become a spiritual treasure in the future."

Speaking of this, Zhang Ziyang's face was somewhat flushed with excitement. He cultivated the path of the God of Incense, and as the main spirit within the banner, he naturally hoped for such an outcome, so it could grow and become stronger.

Xu Yunfan felt a bit embarrassed. Although he agreed verbally, he then asked, "Patriarch, are you really not coming out to give it a try? I can find you a heavenly treasure to forge a先天道体."

Hearing this, Zhang Ziyang was quite tempted, but in the end, he shook his head. "My presence in the banner is of great use to you; I can regulate its various effects. Let's wait until you become a True Lord. For now, this place is also my best ground for enlightenment."

Xu Yunfan didn't try to persuade him further upon hearing this. A brilliant and prodigious figure like Zhang Ziyang naturally has his own considerations.

He flipped his hand and put away the Zodiac Star Soul Banner.

After finishing all this, Xu Yunfan finally looked up towards the shattered heavens above.

He saw the scene of the Heavenly Court, suspended high in the ninefold heavens, was now clear enough to be chilling.

The South Heaven Gate, originally condensed from pure light and auspicious mist, majestic and inviolable, had now completely collapsed.

The giant vermilion-painted, dragon-carved stone pillars were broken and tilted. The magnificent gatehouse with its carved beams and painted rafters was shattered as if by an invisible giant hand, turning into countless large stones burning with pure light or demonic qi flames, floating and scattering, blocking most of the void passage into the Heavenly Court.

Standing on the valley floor, one could even see directly through the huge crack in the ruins of the Heavenly Gate, into the endless palace halls of the Heavenly Court, shrouded in shattered pure light and raging energy storms.

The golden halls and jade pavilions were as if ravaged by a giant beast. Large areas of glazed tiles fell off and flew about, revealing the blackened wooden structures underneath.

The towering palace walls, dozens of zhang high, collapsed and broke, with huge fractures like hideous wounds.

The white jade squares, carved with patterns of flying birds, beasts, and the sun, moon, and stars, cracked and sank.

The immortal pond, once radiating ten thousand zhang of colored light and filled with spiritual mist, overflowed and flowed away. The immortal grasses and strange flowers withered and died completely.

Seeing this scene, Xu Yunfan felt a bit of emotion.

"A true immortal's grandeur, what a pity. Those True Lords were truly ruthless."

A magnificent immortal scene had completely turned into a末日废墟 (doomsday ruin).

Now, two terrifying forces, beyond the limits of imagination, were still fiercely clashing above the core of the Heavenly Court.

The divine arts' brilliance of the Qingyuan True Lord and the so-called Heavenly Emperor continuously exploded, churning that space into a chaotic mess.

Furthermore, the Pudu True Lord's Dao Realm projection, which enshrouded everything and made all things be born and perish in cycles, was slowly pressing down. Every tiny fluctuation caused large golden halls to completely collapse and disintegrate, triggering tremors and roars like those of the earth's veins.

The Heavenly Emperor of this Heavenly Realm could not withstand it; his living space was being rapidly compressed.

The Heavenly Dao of this world was letting out pained and furious groans, but more of its power was being jointly mobilized by the two True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect, firmly suppressing its foundational rules.

Time waits for no one; this is the perfect time to go in and snatch some benefits!

A sharp light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes.

Since the South Heaven Gate is shattered, the portal to the Heavenly Court's treasure vault is wide open.

Although the foundational qi of the界天 (world-realm) is precious, with the Heavenly Court now breached, this is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity for plunder.

Those heavenly treasures, divine pills, magical artifacts, and Daoist scriptures stored in the Heavenly Court, while not worth a True Lord's attention, are certainly worth his.

Once other fellow sect members or the窥伺 (lurking) people from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect clean it out, it will truly be gone.

There will be plenty of opportunities to absorb the界天根气 (foundational qi of the world-realm) later.

Once the Heavenly Realm is breached by the True Lords, a passage will naturally be left in the subsequent world-realm. It will just follow the established procedure.

Thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning, and Xu Yunfan hesitated no longer.

He took a deep breath. The magical power in his body surged, and the secret art of the洞冥蚀天箓 (Dongming Erosion Heaven Talisman) was activated.

The Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Destiny Method drew a trace of the faint Azure Dragon Thunder intent to wrap around his soul.

Simultaneously, the inconspicuous, greyish Primordial Concealing Star Ring on his wrist suddenly lit up with an extremely thin, hazy halo that distorted the surrounding light.

Three major secret treasures, designed to sever heavenly fate and conceal one's tracks, were all operating at full power at the same time.
