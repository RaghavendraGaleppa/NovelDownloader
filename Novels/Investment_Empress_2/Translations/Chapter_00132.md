# Chapter 132: The Overbearing Ice Cube, The Arrangement of the Profound Sage?

"What will be in the second palace?"

"By the way, this秘境 (Secret Realm) actually tests whether people are greedy for wealth..."

Li Mo continued to climb upwards.

This time, after stepping onto the stairs, a sound echoed in his heart once again.

The sound was chanting something.

It sounded like Daoist scriptures, or Buddhist teachings, and in a daze, it also resembled a great Confucian scholar lecturing.

Just as he stepped in front of the palace...

*Boom!*

The sound in his ears suddenly intensified, like the tolling of a great bell, making his mind go blank.

"This is..."

Li Mo looked ahead.

Inside the palace, he saw three bronze statues enshrined.

The first was a solemn and dignified Buddha, sitting cross-legged with a compassionate expression, making the gesture of "picking flowers and smiling."

The second wore a Confucian robe, exuding an air of command. Though it spoke not a word, standing there, it seemed to be the very embodiment of "Reason." This was a statue of a Confucian Sage.

The third... was different from what Li Mo expected. It was not a Daoist, but a statue of a Witch God.

Confucianism, Buddhism, Witchcraft.

The three statues all possessed a heavy aura. Standing there, they seemed to press down on the heavens themselves.

If one were to comprehend them, they might be able to condense an extremely powerful Divine Form within the Divine Observation Realm.

**[Kneel and bow to enter this door.]**

*Thud, thud.*

Another dozen or so people knelt down.

Some did not want to kneel.

But their faces were pale, their veins bulging as they tried to stand up, yet they were firmly pressed to the ground.

"This..."

Although Li Mo felt the pressure, he only felt his breathing become slightly difficult. He had no other sensations.

"The威壓 (oppressive aura) of these three statues comes from the Dao Rules," Ying Bing said softly beside him. "If you hold any reverence for any one of them, you will have to kneel whether you want to or not."

Whether it was the Buddha, the Sage, or the Witch God, she only ever believed in herself.

"So, the first palace tested one's reverence for wealth."

"I wonder why the one who arranged this秘境 is so fond of making people kneel," Li Mo said thoughtfully.

He had lived two lives. In his previous life, he was an atheist, so even if he wanted to kneel, he couldn't.

But why did the test insist on selecting those who did not revere gods or Buddhas and did not crave wealth?

While eating a watermelon, he stepped onto the staircase again.

By now, more than half of the fifty people were gone.

On the way to the third palace, a few more people couldn't withstand the pressure and jumped off the abyss.

Only twenty people had formally made it up.

The statues enshrined here were familiar to everyone.

Clad in a yellow robe, a heavenly sword hanging at the waist, holding a jade seal in hand, with a pair of powerful eyes gazing傲视 (proudly at) the firmament.

Emperor Wu, the Grand Ancestor of the Great Yu Dynasty.

It looked like him at the moment of his ascension to the throne, with a majestic aura that devoured the four seas and eight wildernesses.

*Thud, thud—*

The sound of knees hitting the bronze floor was incessant.

Most people knelt down.

Including the strong-willed Tie Qi, the chief disciple of Ruyi Peak Ouyang, and Bai Jinghong.

"I... alas..."

Tie Qi struggled a few times but felt as if a mountain was pressing down on his shoulders.

He could only look at Li Mo with an apologetic gaze.

Li Mo nodded at him.

Emperor?

This probably represents imperial authority.

Are you kidding me?

With my, Li Mo's, ideological awareness, the only thing that can test me is the people!

So the oppressive feeling here was almost zero.

But he understood Tie Qi's situation.

As a subject of the Great Yu Dynasty, he grew up listening to the stories of Emperor Wu, the Grand Ancestor. How could he not have a sense of reverence in his heart?

So it was understandable that this level left almost everyone behind.

"Why didn't they kneel down?"

Countless unwilling or wry gazes looked over.

Only three people were qualified to go to the fourth palace.

"Let's go, Junior Brother Tang Xiaobao."

The Ice Cube had already continued forward. Li Mo casually threw away the watermelon rind and called out to Tang Xiaobao.

Junior Brother Tang Xiaobao was straining himself, trying to move the statue.

"Why?"

Bai Jinghong almost ground his teeth to pieces.

He was unconvinced!

When he was born, a master said he possessed a Sword Body. At six, he was accepted as a direct disciple by a Law Body expert from Hengyun Sword City.

At twenty-two, he comprehended the Hengyun Sword Intent and made it onto the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List).

At twenty-three, he tested his sword against the world, fighting against the geniuses of a whole province, achieving seventy-four wins and two draws, and cultivated a sword qi within his chest.

In the small Eastern Desolate Domain, why was he kneeling faster than those three?!

He was unconvinced!

*Buzz—*

Looking at the backs of Li Mo and the other two, Bai Jinghong's sword qi and sword intent erupted completely.

Behind him, a divine sword amidst white clouds faintly appeared.

Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth as he stood up.

With every step, he was trembling,承受着 (enduring) immense pressure. His body could not bear the load, and the sound of bones cracking could be heard.

He was getting closer and closer to the staircase.

---

"As long as I can reach that place..."

Finally.

Bai Jinghong stepped onto the staircase.

Hm?

The sensation under his foot was a bit off?

He looked down and saw the watermelon rind under his foot.

He wanted to retract his foot, but it was already too late.

Bai Jinghong: "!"

The crowd: "......"

Stepping on the watermelon rind, he performed on the spot what it meant to be an "Invincible Fire and Wind Wheel."

"Li Mo! I fucking hate you ahhhhhh!!!"

The commotion from behind reached them.

"......"

Li Mo turned back to see the scene and said solemnly:

"Junior Brother Tang Xiaobao, this is why character is important."

"Even in a秘境, we can't litter."

"?"

Tang Xiaobao scratched his head.

You ate the watermelon, you threw the rind, why am I the one being lectured?

Unfortunately, he was a simple-minded fellow. He felt it was strange, but he still nodded.

The three continued upward.

This time, an even stronger pressure swept over them.

If the previous levels were a test of reverence, then this place was pure and undisguised pressure. It was a境界威压 (realm oppressive aura) from a strong one towards a weak one! It made one's soul shudder uncontrollably.

Tang Xiaobao's body emitted a faint golden light.

"It's the Blood Phoenix Essence... no, it's more than that..."

A玄纹 (mystic pattern) flickered between Ying Bing's brows.

She withdrew her gaze from above and swept it over Li Mo.

"Are you alright?"

"I'm fine."

Li Mo found it strange too.

It was the same as when he climbed the Ascension Stone Stairs.

He felt as if he was walking on flat ground.

But looking at Ying Bing's serious expression, this level of stairs seemed to be even more difficult than the previous ones?

"If the goal was to find a successor, it shouldn't be like this," Ying Bing said.

Her eyes reflected the final bronze palace, and she narrowed them slightly.

She had felt something was off since the first test.

It was only until just now that she confirmed it.

She had a good idea of what was up there.

"The intention of these tests doesn't seem to be to find a successor," Li Mo nodded.

"There might be variables at the end. You can wait for me here," Ying Bing suddenly said.

"This aura comes from a Profound Realm expert."

The seventh realm of martial arts, the Profound Realm!

Those figures are almost standing atop the nine heavens and ten earths, on the clouds, receiving the worship and awe of countless martial artists, and are called Sages or Martial Sages.

And they, on the other hand, were only at the second realm, Inner Qi.

No matter what that Profound Realm expert was plotting, the Inner Qi realm was far too weak.

Li Mo glanced at her. "Since we're here, we're here."

The palace at the end should lead to the third layer of the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

It was also where Ying Bing had her accident.

Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed slightly, then relaxed.

Since he wanted to follow, then let him follow.

If something happened, she would be there to handle it...

Not long after.

There were only eight steps left.

The oppressive aura had increased exponentially. Every step felt like going through life and death.

Ying Bing's body was flowing with Yin energy. Her figure remained standing tall, her expression calm.

But from her aura, the pressure she was withstanding was immense.

"Should we take a rest?"

Li Mo, who had been walking as if strolling in a courtyard, asked softly.

But.

Ying Bing did not turn back.

She stared coldly ahead.

"A mere Profound Realm expert wants me to submit?"

"No matter who you are, you are seeking your own death."

Her gaze was clear and cold, her aura becoming even more overbearing and chilling.

Li Mo: "...."

He vaguely felt that the girl's back was like a god or a demon.

It was as if she was the one standing above the clouds, overlooking all living beings, and ruling the world.

But this sounded like...

"You have already courted death"?

But when the same words came from the Ice Cube's mouth, they sounded like a final warning.

If they came from his own mouth, they might just be awkwardly edgy.

The aura was definitely mastered perfectly by the Ice Cube...

At this moment.

Ying Bing took a step onto the end of the staircase.

*Boom—*

In an instant, a strong wind blew.

It was as if the entire秘境 was enraged by this.
