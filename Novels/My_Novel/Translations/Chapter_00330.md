Chapter 330: Admiration, Boasts, and a Second Fortuitous Encounter

Zhao Chunxia came from a sword sect and had a naturally quiet and composed nature. Since being captured, her spirit had been crushed, and a severe illness had invaded her body. She had long known that this life held no hope, leaving only eternal regret. It was only after receiving notes to talk with someone that she gradually overcame her sorrow and her spirits lifted. Her calligraphy was quite accomplished, and she had been curious about Li Xian for a long time, piecing together an image of a free-spirited youth from his words. She thought him similar in age to Wang Long, and she imagined that a young man of that age would be nothing more than that.

Only during the recent fierce battle in the canyon did she realize how very different he was. This young man was far more domineering, far more alert, and far more steady. It was not impossible for a Second Realm expert to kill a Third Realm one, but she had seen Li Xian handle the situation with ease, leveraging his strengths while avoiding his weaknesses, calmly circling his opponent. His arrows concealed his spirit, his spear concealed a chilling gleam, and he wielded his many abilities with both mastery and composure. This was exceptionally rare.

When she finally saw his true face, with its unique features, it was unforgettable. He was truly a top-tier handsome man. She had always considered herself detached and above such matters, but in that instant, she could not help but fall into俗 mundanity. She could not help but be won over in her heart. When he came to her rescue up close, she gazed at him carefully, her beautiful eyes lingering, her heart stirred by ripples. She smiled dignifiedly and said, "Thank you for your rescue, young hero!"

Li Xian said, "It's nothing!" He walked closer and saw the琵琶锁骨链 (pipa collarbone chain) piercing through her bones, a truly gruesome sight. Zhao Chunxia had a dignified and beautiful face, her brows slightly drooping, her lips a pale red, with a few stray strands of hair散乱 on her cheeks. She looked exactly like a beautiful woman in distress, pitiful and怜爱.

Li Xian observed the chain, searching for the mechanism's key point. He inserted the secret key and unlocked the entire collarbone chain. However, the琵琶勾 (pipa hook) was still in her back and could not be pulled out forcefully. He said in a deep voice, "Senior Zhao Chunxia, please endure this for a moment."

Zhao Chunxia said, "Please do as you must, young hero." Her pretty face flushed slightly as she added, "Hui'er, you go out first!"

Ji Hui was quite reluctant but had no choice but to go outside. On the canyon floor, the women gathered in small groups, chattering about what had just happened. Their eyes shone brightly, their longing, respect, and admiration needing no words.

Lin Aoshan was very popular and was surrounded by the daughters of the various sword sects asking questions. Mu Hongchou asked, "Sister Lin, that... that young hero, is he very close with you?" Lin Aoshan raised her head slightly, quite proud, and said, "It's alright. I... I have a bit of a guiding relationship with him. Hmm, nothing worth mentioning."

Zhang Xiaoxue, a famous beauty from the younger generation of the Jiushan Sword Sect, asked, "A guiding relationship? What is this young master's background, where does he live, and what sect is he in now?"

Lin Aoshan said, "He... it's a secret. It's not convenient for me to say." Mu Hongchou asked, "Do you know him well? What kind of person is he? Please tell us, Sister."

Lin Aoshan was very pleased and said proudly, "I suppose I do know him well. He... is different from those young masters of noble families. He is smart and tenacious; he never submits to his enemies. His talent is astonishing. As far as I know, he has just barely come of age, so he is very young. By rights, he should call you all 'Sister'. The last time I saw him, he was no match for me; I dispatched him in just a few moves. Now... he dispatches me in just a few moves."

"He is quite righteous. He makes friends without regard for their background, and his friends all seem to listen to him. I feel quite comfortable interacting with him. Hmm, his优点 (good points) also include..."

The women listened, captivated, feeling even more that such a man was a rare find on earth. Ji Hui had been listening for a while, occasionally glancing towards her master's cave. Zhang Xiaoxue said, "According to what Sister Lin says, is he... is he perfect?" Her heart pounded.

Lin Aoshan said, "If you say he's perfect... I'm afraid not. I know of a major flaw. He is full of tricks and sometimes deliberately plays pranks on people. And... he's too unrestrained... But overall, he is good." The women didn't understand why "being too unrestrained" was a flaw. Lin Aoshan's gaze swept over them, seeing that all the women's pretty faces were red, their eyes rippling with a gentle light, hiding the intentions of spring. If it weren't for him being "too unrestrained," how could this scene be happening?

Mu Hongchou said, "A man should be unrestrained. If he isn't, like that Zhou Shijie, who is pedantic and hypocritical, it's just disgusting." Zhang Xiaoxue and the other women from various sects all nodded in agreement.

Luo Feiyan said, "Saying he's full of tricks is quite accurate." Everyone looked at her. Yi Qianqian, a top disciple of the Yueshan Sword Sect with both beauty and strength, asked, "Sister Luo, do you have some history with him?"

Luo Feiyan's heart fluttered. She thought of the time she was deceived, tied up like a bundle, and thrown into an inn, waiting miserably for days before being rescued. The humiliation of that was hard to tell others. Although she resented it, she wasn't filled with hatred. After being rescued by him again, their debts of gratitude and grudges were already settled, and bringing up the past would be petty. Her face flushed with shyness as she said, "Who... who has history with him? He's so strange, who... who knows what he's thinking?" She bit her lower lip tightly, her gaze shifting away.

Luo Feiyan hurriedly asked, "That's right... he's not a disciple of a sword sect, why did he risk coming to save us? Do you know the reason, Sister Lin?"

Lin Aoshan said, "Of course I do. I am an official of the Imperial Court's Patrol Division, specially here to investigate He Wentian. This villain is ambitious, pretending to be benevolent and kind, making friends with many in the martial world. In reality, he is extremely insidious. I later found out that you were trapped here."

Yi Qianqian said, "That young hero Li Xian, is he also from the Patrol Division?" Lin Aoshan said, "He is not, but he is a good person. He met us halfway, and his purpose was the same; he came here specifically to save you all. Alas, my ability is not as great as his. I leaked my whereabouts early and was captured and brought here."

"He is extremely capable, his mind as细致 as a hair's breadth, and his courage is unparalleled. He managed to find this place and waited for the right moment to rescue us. If it weren't for young Li, we would have been trapped for life, with a miserable end."

The women understood the reason, and all secretly felt fortunate. Their gratitude and admiration grew even stronger. They all thought: "There is no such young man in our sword sects. If not for a lack of wisdom, it's a lack of strategy or courage. And... and none of them are as handsome as this young master. Speaking of handsome... I didn't get a good look at him just now. But to stare at him would be... would be too shameless." Their minds raced, hoping to see him again soon.

Back in the cave, the琵琶锁骨链 had pierced through flesh and bone. Zhao Chunxia was wearing a Taoist robe; she first had to remove her upper garment, have her back acupoints sealed, and have her spine massaged to relax it, before the "琵琶勾" could be pulled out. Otherwise, it would break the bone, cut the flesh, and tear the skin, requiring a long period of rest.

That's why Zhao Chunxia had sent Ji Hui away, but as soon as she said it, she hesitated. "Why not have Ji Hui do this? Oh well, since I've already said it, why be coy?" She said to Li Xian, "Young hero Li Xian, our first meeting is quite unexpected! You are truly extraordinary. Please help me massage my back, then pull out the琵琶勾."

Li Xian said, "It would be my pleasure. Senior Zhao Chunxia, if you hadn't drawn Zheng Dechun's attention beforehand, it wouldn't have been so easy for me to seize the initiative." He first untied her Taoist robe, revealing the white inner garment.

Bloodstains stained a patch red, looking very gruesome. Li Xian breathed out a mist of white vapor, washing away all the bloodstains, exposing her back, which was as delicate as jade. He began to massage. Zhao Chunxia sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, her eyes closed and her lips bitten, feeling a strange sensation.

When her back grew numb and酥麻, Li Xian pulled out the琵琶勾. Zhao Chunxia immediately sealed her blood and pores, greatly relieved. Having just been freed, her strength dissipated, and she fell backward. Li Xian supported her by the shoulders, calling out softly. When Zhao Chunxia had recovered a bit of her energy, he helped her sit up straight, took off her embroidered shoes, and massaged her ankles.

Zhao Chunxia let out an "Ah," never expecting Li Xian to be so natural about it. But she couldn't bring herself to refuse, allowing him to knead her ankles and stimulate the blood flow in her feet. Her ankles had been pierced by iron hooks, obstructing the flow of Qi and blood and causing blood stasis in her wrists.

She forced herself to remain calm but couldn't help the goosebumps rising on her head and back. She felt Li Xian's broad,厚实手掌 holding her entire ankle. Zhao Chunxia said in embarrassment, "The conditions in this cave are poor, and I haven't washed for a long time. You're massaging my feet, please... please don't find them dirty." Li Xian laughed, "I really can't tell. Is Senior Zhao's body free of impurities? Your feet are so small, like beautiful pieces of jade."

Zhao Chunxia's cheeks flushed slightly. "You... we've only just met, you can't be so frivolous. Commenting on a woman's feet like this... is... is not good." Li Xian smiled, "I thought Senior Zhao was unconventional, so I was a little bold. Besides, I'm just speaking the truth, from the heart. If I have offended you, I hope you won't mind."

Zhao Chunxia spat, "You really are a slick-tongued youth. I could tell from your handwriting." It was hard to tell if this was a嗔 (chiding) or shame.

She looked at the young man who had been so high-spirited and dazzling just a moment ago, now seriously massaging her feet. His movements were gentle, and though his words were frivolous, his actions were not disrespectful. Her heart was filled with a soft, sweet affection.

She had never been this close to anyone in her entire life. Her mind was in a daze, both shy and happy. But the moment ended quickly; the iron hooks in her feet were removed. Zhao Chunxia was finally free, but she lingered on the feeling from just before. She thought: "My feet... have never been touched by anyone else. So this is what it feels like. The soles are a bit itchy, but I don't dislike it. If only I could have a long massage in the future..."

Zhao Chunxia put on her shoes and socks and draped her Taoist robe over her shoulders. Her wounds were all covered. Li Xian asked, "Senior Zhao Chunxia, in this state, how much of your ability can you use?"

Zhao Chunxia sighed, "Only one-tenth. I was forced to take the 'Seven Seven Power-Dispersing Powder'; my internal Qi and strength are both suppressed. It will take forty-nine days to fully recover."

Li Xian pondered, "What a pity, what a pity." Zhao Chunxia said apologetically, "For now... I can only do my best to help." Li Xian said, "Let's first rescue the other elders one by one, then we can plan our way out."

Zhao Chunxia said, "Alright!" The two climbed the cliff walls and rescued the elders He Lijun, Peng Sanluo, Tang Mengluo, and others one by one. Zhao Chunxia prided herself on being excellent at "massage," so she was in charge of massaging to remove the hooks. Li Xian held the secret key and unlocked the mechanisms of the various chains.

In about half an hour, all the elders had been saved, and they gathered on the canyon floor. The elders from each sect counted their disciples. The disciples from the Lishan, Yangshan, Jiushan, Hushan, and Yueshan Sword Sects were all safe and sound, a total of '179' women from the five great sword sects. To have survived such great danger and be safe and sound was a joyous occasion. They hugged each other, laughing and chatting, a scene of lively women.

Zhao Chunxia brought her disciple Ji Hui to the Yueshan Sword Sect's female elder Yang Piaoxue and said, "Sister Yang, long time no see!"

Yang Piaoxue cupped her fists, "Sister Zhao! I was just wondering why we hadn't seen you at the meeting of the five sects. It turns out you were captured by the villain first. Our liberation proves that heaven has eyes and did not let the wicked prevail." Zhao Chunxia said, "To be honest, I have lived in seclusion in Jingchun Mountain for too long and paid little attention to sect affairs. I became naive and was deceived and harmed by the villain. I must reflect deeply on my recent ordeal. I should return to the sect to serve and temper myself again. Fortunately, this is all over. Once we escape this place and expose He Wentian's true face, our great仇 (revenge) will be avenged."

Zhao Chunxia said, "Hui'er, pay your respects to your martial aunt. Now that the five great sword sects are united, the disciples and elders of the other sects are also as close as sisters and brothers. You are my disciple, and also a disciple of the Five Mountain Sword Sects."

Ji Hui paid her respects one by one, and the female elders of the five great sword sects introduced themselves to each other. Ji Hui was both beautiful and outstanding in martial arts, and easily blended in with the other women, chatting with them. Zhao Chunxia said, "The reason we were saved is all thanks to this young friend, Li Xian!"

The female elders all expressed their gratitude. Tang Mengluo bowed gracefully, her beautiful eyes filled with joy as she looked Li Xian over. Li Xian responded calmly and respectfully, his words appropriate.

Zhao Chunxia said, "Sisters, in my opinion, our strength is less than one-tenth of what it was. Although we are a few years older than Li Xian, when it comes to strategy and decision-making, I'm afraid we are not a match for this young man. There are so many of us here, and if everyone has their own opinion, it will inevitably lead to conflict and harm the friendship between our five sects. Why don't we let Young Hero Li lead us?"

Yang Piaoxue said, "I agree." Tang Mengluo smiled, "I was thinking the same thing." ... Li Xian could not refuse and cupped his fists, saying, "I am honored by your trust. I, Li Xian, will do my utmost to help."

The female disciples cheered and hugged each other, their gazes all turning to him. Li Xian immediately issued an order, telling the disciples and elders of the five sects to rest where they were, to restore their spirits and nurture their strength.

Li Xian walked around the canyon, thinking: "After so much hardship, I have saved all these women. We just need to leave this place, and we can get away safely. This trip has yielded the 'Art of Golden Light', and my martial arts have advanced further. The benefits are many. Though there were dangers, it has turned out well in the end."

Feeling relaxed, he took down the Ghost Python Spear. He swept the spear tip across the ground, sending a large patch of snow flying. Li Xian thrust at the ground repeatedly, each thrust containing the essence of the "Gang Thunder Finger". After a dozen or so thrusts, a pit had formed in the ground.

He threw the bodies of Zheng Dechun's three sons into the pit and covered them with soil. Li Xian breathed out a clear breath, cleansing the filth from the spear shaft. He thought: "This battle had its twists, but it was easier than I imagined. I hadn't even used my killer move, but Zheng Dechun was already dead."

Li Xian walked to a tree. Two long swords were插 (stuck) vertically into the trunk: the "Green Sword" and the "Sinking River Sword". Li Xian had originally planned to first use arrow techniques to harass and circle his opponent, to test his bottom line and showcase his own strengths to挫 (break) his opponent's spirit. Then he would engage in close combat, using the残魍枪 to circle and the Golden Light Art to保命 (save his life). If the stalemate continued and he couldn't win, he would pretend to flee, running to this area. Then he would suddenly grab the swords, holding the残魍枪 in his left hand and the残阳衰血剑 in his right, to launch a surprise attack. But Zheng Dechun's fist and leg techniques were so poor he couldn't even defend against the exquisite moves of the残魍枪. Furthermore, due to his "Self-Marriage, Self-Gifting, Child-Sending" martial art, he had already "sent away" his first life.

The women started a fire to warm themselves. Lin Aoshan, Luo Feiyan, and others paired up to explore the surroundings, discovering many weapons and swords. They distributed them among themselves, and some women practiced with their swords to warm up, making the scene quite lively.

Li Xian looked into the distance. The terrain of the Prisoner Women's Canyon was unique. The cliff walls were over fifty zhang high, but after twenty-five zhang, they became even more perilous and strange, covered by wind and snow year-round, with阴霜 (yin frost) congealing on the walls. Even with lightness skill, it was difficult to cross. The yin frost clung to the cliff walls, leaving no place to land or borrow force from. Moreover, the frost was exceptionally cold, freezing the vital points of one's body and hindering movement, severely reducing the effectiveness of lightness skill.

Li Xian had fought Zheng Dechun by secretly climbing an iron chain to the very top, enduring the wind and snow, and using his archery skills to attack. He practiced the "Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword," which gave him the "Heart Fire" attribute, and he wore the "Pure Gang Qi Robe," so his cold resistance was far superior to that of an ordinary person, allowing him to move freely without hindrance. The reason he could so effectively tie down Zheng Dechun was precisely because of this terrain.

Yang Piaoxue found her own sword and cupped her fists, asking, "Young Hero Li, our lives are all in your hands. Please instruct us on what to do next." She had an ordinary appearance, wore a light yellow silk shirt and fitted long pants, with black boots, giving off a heroic air.

Li Xian thought: "I see that their spirits have all recovered. It's time to think of an escape plan." He said, "The stone door behind us is thick and heavy, and there are giant stones blocking it outside. Even if we work together, we can't move it an inch. It's impossible to escape through the stone door. For now... I'm afraid we have to go upwards."

Everyone looked up. The yin wind howled, and the frost was bone-chilling. Tang Mengluo opened her mouth and said, "This is a canyon, so logically, we should be able to escape from above. But I'm afraid it's not that simple, otherwise the stone door would be meaningless."

Li Xian said, "What Elder Tang says makes sense, but there's no harm in trying. Is there anyone among you with excellent lightness skill? Come with me to scout upwards. If we can get through, we'll give it a try. If not, we'll find another way."

All the elders were seriously injured, their internal Qi and strength were weak, so it was not suitable for them to move about. The women, upon hearing that they would be working with Li Xian, were all willing to give it a try, but they were naturally reserved and shy, afraid of being laughed at for their poor skills. So, after hesitating for a while, no one answered. After a long moment, Mu Hongchou said, "Young Hero Li, my lightness skill is decent, and I am willing to try with you." Li Xian cupped his fists and praised, "Sister Mu Hongchou has a chivalrous heart, I admire that."

Mu Hongchou happily said, "I admire you even more, Young Hero. I'm happy to be able to work with you." Seeing Mu Hongchou boldly offer to help, the other women couldn't help but feel a sense of loss and regret.

The cliff walls were as if cut by a knife or an axe. At the bottom, there were still grasses and vines to step on and borrow force from, so they could ascend calmly and without much effort. A few zhang higher, the walls became smooth, with very few protrusions, making it even harder to find a foothold.

When they reached a dozen or so zhang, the wind and snow howled, becoming even more密集 (dense). This severely affected the use of lightness skill. Mu Hongchou's speed suddenly slowed. Li Xian, relying on his many special abilities, had not slowed down, but he was also disturbed by the wind and snow, making his footing unstable.

By the time they reached over twenty zhang, the cliff walls were icy and slippery, covered in thousands of years of accumulated cold. They had to be extremely cautious with every step. If they slipped, it would be difficult to climb higher. Mu Hongchou reached twenty-four zhang, gritting her silver teeth. Though unwilling to give up, she knew she had reached her limit. She lightly tapped the cliff wall with her toes, turned, and leaned back, gracefully landing back on the ground. She couldn't help but shiver, her hair tips, clothes, and eyelashes already covered in ice and frost.

Lin Aoshan brought over some hot soup and asked, "Sister Mu, what was the situation like?" Mu Hongchou said, "It's much more difficult than I imagined. The higher up, the yin cold penetrates the bones, and even if I circulate my Qi through my meridians, it's hard to resist. And the wind and snow obscure your vision; sometimes you can't tell the sky from the ground, and you don't know where to land."

She admired him even more and said, "In any other canyon, twenty or thirty zhang would be high, but it wouldn't be considered difficult. But this place has a unique terrain, making it very hard. Young Hero Li just climbed a chain to over thirty zhang and fought with Zheng Dechun. It looked easy, but after trying it myself, I realize how many difficulties and dangers there are here."

Li Xian leaped a few more zhang but had to give up as well. He landed on the ground and said in a deep voice, "Going upwards, I'm afraid, is not possible. My cold resistance is strong, but the cliff walls are icy and slippery, and the wind and snow are too strong. Relying only on my lightness skill, it's hard to cross the canyon. Although the elders' abilities are high and their lightness skill is strong, their cold resistance may not be as good as mine. After reaching thirty zhang or so, their hands would go numb and their feet would be paralyzed... it would still be impossible to cross."

He said, "He Wentian is deep and scheming. The path above may look passable, but in reality, it is not."

The women felt a slight disappointment. Li Xian said, "There is not much food here. If we wait idly, we will only have to endure the cold and hunger. Later, when the stone door is opened, our enemies will surely follow. By then, a fierce battle will be unavoidable, with heavy casualties. For now, since going forward is difficult and going up is also difficult, the only way is to go deeper and explore the mysteries within. But going inward also has its dangers. I cannot predict what situations we will encounter. I have decided to explore. Whether you follow or not is up to you."

Zhao Chunxia was very appreciative, thinking to herself: "Though he bears a great responsibility, he is not arrogant. This young man's steadiness is rare, and the more I see of him, the more I admire him. Though he is the same age as Wang Long, his ability to handle affairs and adapt is far superior." After a moment of discussion, the women all expressed their willingness to go together.

The Prisoner Women's Canyon extended inward, covered in dense vegetation. Li Xian thought: "Going inward is definitely fraught with danger, but since we have set foot in this dangerous place, how can there be a foolproof plan? I can only be careful in all things, do my best, and leave the rest to fate."

Before setting off, Li Xian organized the order and supplies.

He divided the women into six squads: one for each of the five great sword sects, and one for the martial artists from the Jianghu. The squads were further divided into "groups" of ten. Those who were close were prioritized to be in the same "group" so they could look after and support each other. They were to constantly pay attention to their companions' whereabouts. The arrangement of order was appropriate and reasonable.

Li Xian further subdivided the duties: who would transport grain, who would patrol, who would handle miscellaneous tasks, who would gather fruits and grains... He arranged everything in detail, to prevent chaos if a situation suddenly arose. The elders were physically weak but had extensive experience, so they didn't need to labor over miscellaneous tasks; they only needed to rest and offer advice.

Li Xian selected the outstanding disciples from each sect: Lin Aoshan, Luo Feiyan, Yi Qianqian, and Mu Hongchou to assist him. The five sword sects had a total of 179 people, plus the Jianghu martial artists, making nearly two hundred people in total. Each had their own duties and positions, and they cooperated with each other.

All the elders felt admiration. They admitted they were not as good as Li Xian and all thought: "This young man is truly an all-rounder. At such a young age, how can he be so experienced in handling affairs? We are ashamed to be elders; we are truly inferior to him in leadership." They all sighed again, thinking: "If we can escape this time, these young girls will probably add to their worries. Encountering such a talent, how can their hearts not be stirred?"

That night, the group lit fires to keep warm. The servants and cooks had fled in a hurry, leaving some surplus food. There were three to five carts of fruits, vegetables, rice, grains, beans, and meat. It was enough to last two days. Li Xian lay on a snow blanket, sleeping peacefully, recalling the past. He had provoked mountain bandits and led the people of Black River Village to fight them. He applied that experience to this situation, thinking: "This is both a crisis and a gift. If not for my experience in Black River Village, if you asked me to lead all these women now, I'd probably be in a frantic mess and wouldn't know what to do. Moreover, the disciples of the sword sects are not weak. If used properly, they can help me escape this dangerous situation."

The next morning. Li Xian got up and practiced his spear, improving his spear arts and accumulating proficiency. Zhao Chunxia practiced the 'Spring Viewing Treasure Classic' internally, and a spring aura actually bloomed around her, with green sprouts emerging from the snow blanket. Li Xian pondered: "The foundation of a sword sect cannot be underestimated. I have a volume of the Jade Avoiding Classic, which is also a health-preserving art, but I haven't had a chance to practice it. For now... it's best to continue honing the残魍枪. Madam once granted me the 'Flicking Finger Golden Light,' which I have also neglected for a long time and have yet to touch. Once we escape this danger, I will cultivate them one by one."

Li Xian's posture was潇洒 (free and unrestrained).

[Proficiency +1]

[Ghost Python Spear]

[Proficiency: 6678/35000 (Perfect)]

[You have digested the essence of heaven and earth, Proficiency +1]

[Bone-Shaping Luo Embryo]

[Proficiency: 8/100]

His spear arts were gradually improving. After half an hour, everything was ready, and they began to explore deeper, leaving red rope marks along the way. The canyon path was long and winding. After walking for about a day, the vegetation along the way began to change, with more green moss and less snow. Seeing that the women were tired, Li Xian ordered them to rest for the night.

The women were all daughters of the Jianghu, their temperaments either shy or demure, but none were fussy about small matters and all understood the big picture. They cooperated and divided their tasks: cooking food, setting up grass huts... A few women were particularly resourceful, boiling fine meals for Li Xian and setting up a private tent for him.

They brought tea and water, being very thoughtful. Li Xian was taken aback for a moment, then smiled and took the food and tea. The night passed peacefully, and they set out again the next day. They walked for two more days in this manner. The canyon path was dark and endless, with no sign of its end.

The food they had brought was all gone. Along the way, they found some strange fruits and herbs... which they boiled in snow water to make a fresh fruit and wild vegetable soup. It was enough to barely satisfy their hunger. After walking for about a day in this way, the women had their cultivation to sustain them, so they weren't starving, but without food to replenish them, combined with the cold environment, their spirits were inevitably greatly dampened.

That night, they set up camp to rest again. Li Xian felt something different under his feet, a slight softness. So he let his hair fall and take root, sensing the details of the ground. Li Xian immediately felt something was wrong and went forward alone to scout. He used his lightness skill to leap and jump, sending out his hair several times to sense the details of the ground.

After about half an hour, Li Xian returned to the camp and said to everyone, "Further ahead is a marshland. It is made of strange soil with very strong adhesion. Even with cultivation, we cannot be careless. We need to be connected by ropes before we can proceed."

The women knew the road ahead was long and followed his instructions. The next day, when the sky was just turning gray, they tied themselves together with ropes and set foot in the marsh area. Li Xian, relying on the subtleties of his lightness skill, went a few steps ahead to scout the path.

The canyon was dark and deep. As they went deeper, the light gradually disappeared. Li Xian opened his double pupils, scanning the surroundings for details. He had intended to observe for hidden dangers, but he discovered a secret and strange scene: there was a fissure in the cliff wall, and from within the fissure, a faint light was shining.

Inside was a natural stalactite cave, filled with a riot of colors and dazzling halos. The sound of "drip-drip" spring water could be heard from time to time. Inside, there was a stone shaped like a large cauldron, hollow in the middle, and inside the cauldron was a white pill.

After a moment of surprise, Li Xian was overjoyed. He had once heard Madam Wen say that the "Path of Alchemy" is vast; humans can refine pills, and so can heaven and earth. In certain奇特 (奇特) terrains and Feng Shui, heavenly and earthly奇丹 (strange pills) can be孕育 (孕育).

This stone cauldron had formed naturally; having its form, it also had its function. The cauldron was formed, and the pill appeared. The mystery of heaven and earth, the workings of the unseen, naturally refined a pill.
