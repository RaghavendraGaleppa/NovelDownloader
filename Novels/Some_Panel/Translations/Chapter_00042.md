**Chapter 42: Beast Tide Eruption?**

[Level 10 Blacktail Fish.]
[Level 10 Dragon-Marked Demon.]
[Level 10 Overlord Crab.]
[Demon Commander-level Three-Headed Serpent.]
[Demon Commander-level Black Demon Shark.]
[Demon Commander-level Infant Carp Beast.]

Yang Ji's expression instantly changed. Looking out, the sea surface was densely covered with information on various demonic beasts. Demon General-level was still manageable, equivalent to Human Foundation Establishment, but Demon Commander-level was equivalent to Human Golden Core cultivators. A quick glance revealed three of them. Such power was enough to flatten the entire Black Wind Island.

"What's wrong?" Seeing Yang Ji's strange expression, Golden Abacus followed his gaze and was instantly startled. On the moonlit sea, enormous creatures, half-submerged, were furiously breaking through the water, swimming rapidly towards the island.

"A beast tide!" Golden Abacus roared, hastily adding, "Quick, quick, quick! Fly high into the sky! It'll be too late if you wait!" As he spoke, he transformed into a streak of light, soaring straight into the high heavens, away from the island.

"Eh? Why is that kid Golden Abacus so tense?" Mang Biao had been watching the sky, strictly preventing Yang Ji from escaping. With his powerful vision as a Golden Core True Person, he witnessed Golden Abacus's panicked flight. Before he could ponder for long, he saw Yang Ji also rapidly shoot into the sky.

"This junior wants to escape again? Is he playing some trick with Golden Abacus?" Mang Biao smiled faintly, then immediately emerged from the great hall, carrying the force of wind and thunder, and soared into the sky. As he approached Yang Ji, a hint of surprise flashed across his face, for he found Yang Ji waiting for him with a serious expression.

Over the past ten-plus days, the islanders' praises had been constantly in his ears. Yang Ji didn't want to see them die tragically in the beast tide, so he chose to "escape" as the quickest way to inform Mang Biao. He stepped forward and said solemnly, "Island Master Mang, a beast tide has erupted. Quickly take the brothers from the hall and leave the island."

"A beast tide?" Mang Biao's expression tightened. Following Yang Ji's gaze towards the sea, he too felt a chill run through him. "Those sharp, fin-like backs emerging from the sea like sails... are those Black Demon Sharks?"

"Precisely, a Demon Commander-level Black Demon—" Before Yang Ji could finish, Mang Biao had vanished from his sight.

"That guy..." Yang Ji was momentarily stunned, then no longer lingered, soaring rapidly upwards. Before he could reach a safe zone, he heard gusts of wind roaring behind him. In an instant, over a dozen streaks of light flashed past him, flying ahead. Yang Ji looked closely and saw that those streaks of light were none other than the Foundation Establishment cultivators from Black Wind Island.

"These guys have a strong will to survive, arriving ahead despite starting later. As Foundation Establishment cultivators, they can utilize the ambient spiritual energy to generate an aura, which makes them fly fast!"

Just as Yang Ji was marveling, *whoosh!* A sound like a J-20 fighter jet roaring through the sky erupted behind him. Mang Biao, holding five Qi Condensation cultivators in each hand, shot past him with a boom, reaching the heavens. The sheer speed generated such a strong gust of wind that it almost distorted Yang Ji's face. Before he could react, Mang Biao, returning halfway, grabbed his shoulder and gave him a push upwards. A tremendous force sent him soaring to the heavens at such speed that it created a sonic boom.

In just an instant, Yang Ji arrived at the safe zone where the others were gathered. He cast his gaze downwards and saw Mang Biao constantly darting back and forth, using extreme speed to transport the weaker Qi Condensation cultivators from the island to high altitudes. Witnessing such terrifying supersonic speed, Yang Ji immediately dispelled any thoughts of trying to sneak away. Mang Biao was simply too fast. In a flash of light, he had already brought most of the island's cultivators to this high altitude.

In the path of cultivation, sometimes flying fast meant saving your life. Yang Ji was already considering whether he should find a flying spell, as his Lightness Art was indeed too slow. He had always had this thought, but unfortunately, Canglan Pavilion didn't sell good flying spells. Only low-level flying spells like "Lightness Art," "Cloud Walking Art," and "Floating Art" were available, and they were all pretty much the same. Practicing one such spell was enough; practicing more would be useless and a waste of time. "It seems I'll have to check again when I join a sect," Yang Ji mused to himself. At this moment, he had 100% confidence in joining a sect, because the demon companion grass he currently possessed was enough to support him in cultivating to the tenth level of Qi Condensation, or even the peak of the tenth level, within the remaining time. Such thoughts arose within the scope of his abilities and strength.

Just as he was lost in thought, the cultivators beside him let out sounds of surprise and confusion. "What's going on? Why has a beast tide erupted again?" A Foundation Establishment Hall Master from Black Wind Island, frowning, asked with extreme puzzlement.

"Exactly, only three years have passed since the last beast tide. Why is it happening again? This frequently?" Someone else also expressed confusion.

"Hmm?" Yang Ji gazed at the demonic beasts below, as if making a discovery. He then turned his head and asked, "Why do beast tides usually erupt?"

"To answer Second Island Master, simply put, beast tides usually erupt because demonic beasts want to eat humans. For human cultivators, demonic beasts are treasures from head to toe, and human cultivators are also a great supplement in the mouths of demonic beasts. Eating one can equate to several, or even over a dozen, years of their cultivation," said Tang Long, a Foundation Establishment Hall Master from the side.

A beast tide erupting, demonic beasts eating humans? They should be excited, so why do they all seem a bit frightened? Yang Ji frowned, watching the enormous creatures gradually approaching the island. His gaze swept over them, and above their heads, he saw:
*   [Fear]
*   [Panic]
*   [The Earth God is angry]
*   [Swim faster, don't block the way]
*   [Brother, let me lie on your back, give me a ride.]

"The Earth God is angry?" Just as Yang Ji felt puzzled. Then he heard an "Yi-ya" sound, a sudden cry like an infant's. This sound was tender, yet it contained terrifyingly powerful soundwave energy. A visible soundwave, manifesting as ripples, surged towards the great hall on the island. As the soundwave swept through, with a *boom*, the great hall where everyone had been residing instantly collapsed, turning into a pile of dust scattered across the ground.

"This Infant Carp Beast is too strong," Golden Abacus watched, his heart pounding.

"Damn it, this fellow destroyed my palace." Mang Biao, who had just brought the last two Qi Condensation cultivators to high altitude, suddenly turned his head, followed the sound, and witnessed the scene of the palace's collapse. His face instantly turned ashen with rage.

"This Infant Carp Beast's soundwave attack is too powerful. Fortunately, we all escaped. Otherwise, with just that one cry, all of us would have died, except for the Island Master," the crowd felt a shiver of post-terror.

Just as everyone was still in shock, a howling wind sound came from below. It was an enormous Black Demon Shark, the size of a submarine, covered in dense black patterns as if possessed by a demon god. With a single flick of its giant tail, it ripped through the air and charged straight towards the heavens.

"It's a Black Demon Shark, it's coming for us!" Someone immediately cried out in alarm.

"Don't panic, one hundred zhang is its maximum leaping height. It can't harm us," a Foundation Establishment cultivator said, frowning in an attempt to reassure.

Yang Ji saw that the charging Black Demon Shark had the following displayed above its head: [Disdain], [I will shoot water arrows to kill you all], [I will eat you all].

"Island Master Mang, something's not right! It's holding seawater in its mouth, it seems to be about to shoot water arrows!" Yang Ji hastily shouted.

"Hmph, you beast, I knew it was up to no good." As a Golden Core True Person who had long roamed the Demonic Sea, Mang Biao was experienced. The moment he saw the Black Demon Shark charging, he knew roughly what its moves would be. Immediately, he grabbed forward with his left palm, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth rapidly converged. In an instant, a square defensive shield covered with mysterious runes formed in mid-air. Then, he swept his right hand across his storage bag, and a sky-cleaving giant axe appeared in his palm. With one hand holding the shield and the other the giant axe, in the next instant, he boldly charged down with the majestic momentum of a falling meteor.
