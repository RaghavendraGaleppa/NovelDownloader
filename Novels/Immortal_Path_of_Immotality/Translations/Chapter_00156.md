# Chapter 155: Order Snatching and Cancellation

The massive transport airship cut swiftly through the sky, stringing together wisps of white clouds in its wake as rivers and mountains receded below. Some birds playfully chased after it.

On the deck, the wooden-faced man showed little surprise when a black skeleton approached him. Many demonic cultivators often ended up looking neither human nor ghost from their training—a skeletal appearance wasn't anything new.

Lin Shan breathed a sigh of relief as Black Skeleton Monarch successfully approached the target. Soon, the two began conversing, their discussion growing increasingly animated.

At one point, Black Skeleton Monarch pointed toward Lin Shan. The wooden-faced man followed the gesture and looked over. Unsure what the skeleton had told the target, Lin Shan simply smiled and nodded in response.

After that, the pair no longer glanced his way, engrossed in their conversation.

Eventually, Black Skeleton Monarch produced a small glowing array and handed it to the wooden-faced man. The latter examined it carefully, growing visibly fond of it. However, his wariness remained strong, and he reluctantly returned it to the skeleton after some time.

By dusk, their conversation concluded. The wooden-faced man excused himself and retreated to his cabin. Other passengers on the deck, having lost interest in the scenery, also returned to their rooms to meditate.

Black Skeleton Monarch rejoined Lin Shan, grinning widely.

"Done."

---

Lin Shan's room was on the third floor of the airship's cabin, right next to the wooden-faced man's. The proximity was intentional for ease of action. As for the cabin's protective formations, they were trivial for Black Skeleton Monarch to bypass.

Back in the room, the skeleton retrieved the small glowing array, revealing a faint wisp of white mist resembling an earthworm. It decanted the mist into a small vial and tossed it to Lin Shan.

"This is the target's aura. It'll dissipate within three days at most."

Lin Shan caught it, marveling at how Black Skeleton Monarch's restored Foundation Establishment-level abilities had expanded its repertoire of esoteric techniques, proving increasingly useful.

Without hesitation, Lin Shan set up the necessary tools in his room, unconcerned about the skeleton observing. After all, it had been summoned through this very divine ability and was familiar with the process.

"Whoosh—"

The curtains were drawn, plunging the room into darkness.

A straw effigy stood at the center, flanked by two candles, with the vial placed between them. The shadows of man and skeleton stretched ominously across the walls. Lin Shan activated a soundstone, filling the room with eerie music to complete the sinister atmosphere.

Under Black Skeleton Monarch's unimpressed gaze, Lin Shan nocked his first arrow and began the curse.

"Swish!"

His consciousness traversed the void within the effigy, arriving in the adjacent room where the wooden-faced man sat cross-legged, enveloped in dark demonic energy as he practiced some demonic art.

Suddenly, the man began convulsing uncontrollably. His robes billowed as his eyes snapped open in terror, bewildered by the inexplicable affliction.

His robes exploded outward, revealing skin covered in red patches and tiny blisters that sprouted across his body. Overcome by unbearable itchiness, he frantically popped the blisters, releasing yellow pus filled with white eggs—countless unknown parasites infesting his skin.

New blisters erupted as fast as he destroyed them. Panicked, he channeled his demonic energy to expel the invaders, but the blisters only grew larger, nourished by the energy. The pus swelled with white eggs on the verge of hatching, his body their incubator.

Desperate, he resorted to extreme measures, tearing at his skin as yellow pus splattered everywhere, turning the room into a reeking hellscape.

Lin Shan withdrew his consciousness. The first arrow had struck.

Black Skeleton Monarch, who had secretly set up a formation to monitor the adjacent room, mused thoughtfully.

"Continue."

Lin Shan nocked a second arrow. By now, the wooden-faced man was anything but wooden—his usual stoicism shattered by horror.

Screams of agony filled the air as he clawed at his face, disfiguring himself until only his bleeding eye sockets remained recognizable amidst the gore.

His flesh peeled back to reveal layers of squirming eggs, carried by his bloodstream into his internal organs. Through the gaping wounds, black light pulsed from within, as if some monstrous entity was gestating inside him—or perhaps a portal to another realm was opening within his body.

Black flames erupted from within, charring the white eggs with a sickening sizzle. The stench of burning protein and pus coalesced into toxic clouds, shrouding the man from view.

Lin Shan withdrew again and nocked a third arrow, this time sparing himself the gruesome spectacle.

The curse was meant to incapacitate, not to indulge in sadism. The rest could be left to Black Skeleton Monarch.

"Thud!"

Three arrows pierced the effigy. As Lin Shan packed up, the skeleton's elongated shadow nodded and departed wordlessly.

Lin Shan meditated calmly, awaiting results.

Soon, Black Skeleton Monarch returned, its skeletal face as expressionless as ever.

"Well?"

It hesitated, deep in thought before tossing a storage pouch to Lin Shan.

Inside were assorted trinkets of little value, save for two high-grade magic tools: a green short staff and an ancient brown zither. The reinforcement panel spared him the trouble of appraising them.

**[Jade Stone Staff]**
- Grade: High-grade magic tool  
- Description: Forged from third-tier jade essence, imbued with three advanced durability inscriptions.  
- Reinforcement cost: 32 points  

**[Ebony Zither]**
- Grade: High-grade magic tool  
- Description: Crafted from fourth-tier abyssal ebony, inscribed with five advanced soul-based techniques: suppression, terror, assault, illusion, and heartfire. Capable of long-range soul attacks.  
- Reinforcement cost: 32 points  

The staff was unremarkable, but the zither was extraordinary—made from materials fit for crafting magic treasures. Its soul-striking capabilities made it a deadly weapon against unprepared foes.

Had Lin Shan faced the wooden-faced man directly without Black Skeleton Monarch's aid, he might have fallen victim to the zither's soul attacks followed by a crushing blow from the staff.

A chill ran down Lin Shan's spine. He had grown overconfident after defeating Qi Zhong, a elite disciple of a major sect, unaware that others possessed such potent soul weapons.

Had it not been for the curse weakening the target and Black Skeleton Monarch's formations, this mission might have taken a disastrous turn.

"That man was no ordinary foe. Your sect leader wouldn't have assigned him as a test otherwise," Black Skeleton Monarch remarked casually, omitting details of how it handled the target.

"A late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator should have more than two high-grade magic tools."

"The other two were defensive items destroyed in the struggle. Resistance was inevitable."

Lin Shan eyed the skeleton skeptically, knowing its penchant for skimming profits. Yet, since it had left him the valuable zither, he let it slide.

"And the curse's outcome?"

"Hmm."

Black Skeleton Monarch's soul flame flickered oddly—a telltale sign of something unusual.

"This time, it wasn't an eldritch entity... but an old acquaintance."

"What do you mean?"

"Your curse manifested as a phenomenon, but the summoned entity came from elsewhere."

The skeleton theorized that Lin Shan's curses could either manifest as phenomena or summon beings from contracted realms—depending on whether any entities accepted the "order."

Previously, eldritch beings had "snatched" the summoning requests, but this time, a denizen of the Netherworld had responded.

"An old friend from the Netherworld?"

"The Three-Headed Hellhound, a lowly creature from the Third Netherworld. My forces once clashed with them—utterly insignificant."

"So...?"

"I canceled the order on your behalf."

Black Skeleton Monarch had arrogantly dismissed the hellhound, claiming it was beneath consideration.

Lin Shan sensed something amiss but couldn't pinpoint what. The room seemed to smell faintly of... tea?

"How did your campaign in the Third Netherworld end?"

"Well... we retreated strategically due to unfavorable conditions. We'll regroup with other monarchs of Skeleton Ridge for another attempt when the time is right."

Lin Shan nodded solemnly, patting the skeleton's scapula in solidarity as they mocked the Third Netherworld's weakness.

Meanwhile, in a distant realm beyond the void...

The Third Netherworld seethed with rage. Molten lava geysered skyward as a colossal obsidian hall floated atop the magma sea. Upon its throne, a three-headed hellhound wreathed in black flames roared furiously.

"That damned skeleton from the Fifth Netherworld! Beaten here, yet it interferes elsewhere!"

"Our hard-won summoning order, canceled outright!"

"Unacceptable! Tomorrow, we march on the Fifth Netherworld and teach that bony wretch a lesson!"

"Agreed!"

"Agreed!"
