**Chapter 14: Battle with the Overlord Crab**

First-tier to tenth-tier demonic beasts correspond to human cultivators at Qi Refining Layer One to Qi Refining Layer Ten. Above tenth-tier demonic beasts are Demonic Generals, Demonic Marshals, Demonic Kings, and Demonic Emperors.

This fifth-tier Overlord Crab was only on par with Yang Ji in terms of level, and not a royal among demons. Their strengths were not vastly different, so he naturally had no fear. Now, seeing his sword strike yield no results, the Overlord Crab's eyes filled with smugness, and it actually conceived the idea of devouring him.

Yang Ji was naturally indignant, his entire body erupting with an imposing aura. Once the Lightness Art was unleashed, he shot forth like a swift gale. Spiritual energy surged like a raging sea into his flying sword. The Cloudsoaring Sword instantly radiated a chilling aura, and its tip hissed with unparalleled sharpness. The Flowing Water Sword Art was unleashed once more.

Swish!

Where the sword tip pointed, the air tore like a sheet of paper. Sword light whistled! The speed and sharpness of this sword strike reached their peak.

The Overlord Crab's reaction wasn't slow either. It glared with its large eyes, and swiftly raised one of its massive claws to shield itself. The flying sword and the great claw collided with a resounding clang, producing a sound like metal striking stone.

Whirr! Whirr! Whirr!

The sword tip, like a drill, pressed against the great claw, sending sparks flying. Although the Overlord Crab was pushed back several feet by the force of this sword strike, the flying sword found it difficult to penetrate even an inch.

Though regrettable, Yang Ji had anticipated this. A glint flashed in his eyes, and his figure suddenly moved, like a phantom, instantly circling to the Overlord Crab's side. The flying sword in his hand was unleashed again with extreme speed.

Clink!

A sword strike landed precisely on the Overlord Crab's flank, and where the sword tip touched, a point of white light instantly appeared. White light, still white light. A strike to the flank still failed to pierce it.

"That guy!" Yang Ji's gaze deepened, but he didn't lose focus. Before the Overlord Crab could react, he stomped his feet hard, his figure springing up like an arrow, and with a hiss, directly stabbed the Overlord Crab's eye. With one thrust, it felt incredibly soft, like sinking into a swamp. The force carried by the flying sword was instantly completely dispelled. The sharpness it carried also failed to pierce its eyeball.

"This guy's defense is so strong, even his eyes are impenetrable. He really has no weak points at all," Yang Ji frowned slightly.

The Overlord Crab, having been struck twice in quick succession, had '[Startled]' appear above its head, which then turned into '[Enraged]'.

Hiss!

It let out a furious hiss, its aura becoming violent, and a gush of turbid, foul-smelling green gas erupted towards Yang Ji.

[Overlord Crab's inner abdominal gas: highly corrosive, also paralyzes the soul. If you take it head-on, you will be heavily wounded.]

Heavily wounded? As the green gas surged, Yang Ji's expression immediately changed, and he swiftly flew back. Hiss, hiss, hiss!

Seeing Yang Ji evade, the Overlord Crab let out a furious roar, its rage completely ignited. A layer of yellow light suddenly flared on its body. To Yang Ji's astonishment, it violently rose from the ground, soaring and pouncing like a tank, claws outstretched. Its massive body bore down, its aura suppressing all around.

Yang Ji's expression slightly tightened. He swiftly moved horizontally, dodging to the side. "Thud!" The Overlord Crab slammed down, its eighteen thick legs digging into the sand, creating deep pits. For a moment, sand and pebbles flew, obscuring vision.

Just as Yang Ji was evading the flying sand and stones, its thick legs moved in unison, closing in once more. One large claw suddenly rose overhead, emitting endless yellow light, carrying incomparable power, and slammed down towards Yang Ji with crushing force. Fast and fierce, immensely powerful. Yang Ji felt as if the great claw was a falling star, its immense momentum unstoppable. This move was extremely oppressive, tearing the air. The fierce energy swept through, making his cheeks ache as if cut by sharp blades. It was too fast. The move the Overlord Crab unleashed with all its might made it impossible for him to dodge. If caught by that great claw, he would surely be cut in half.

Although Yang Ji's expression was slightly solemn, he remained calm in the face of danger. He saw his gaze flick upwards, spiritual energy surging from within him. The flying sword in his hand moved abruptly, flashing upwards like lightning, meeting the Overlord Crab's great claw.

Boom!

The great claw and the flying sword collided with a thunderous impact in an instant. Yellow light and water-blue sword qi exploded like a storm, streaks of visible spiral energy shooting in all directions. Yang Ji was sent flying by the claw, staggering back continuously with 'thud, thud, thud' sounds as the sand beneath his feet erupted with 'boom, boom, boom' noises. It wasn't until eighteen impacts later that all the force was discharged, and he finally managed to steady himself, albeit somewhat dishevelled. In contrast, the Overlord Crab simply braced with its hind legs, and its body instantly stabilized. Immediately, the difference in their strength became clear.

Yang Ji's pupils contracted. He looked at the Cloudsoaring Sword, which was still humming and vibrating, and said gravely, "This fellow has incredible strength! Fortunately, the flying sword wasn't damaged. It seems this guy's shell isn't too strong either; I still have the power to resist with the Cloudsoaring Sword. This sword truly lives up to its reputation as a top-grade low-tier magical artifact. If it were any other low-tier flying sword, I fear it would have already snapped."

Whoosh!

A sharp whistling sound ripped through the air again. The Overlord Crab's eighteen thick legs moved in unison, like heavenly spears, suddenly charging forward to kill.

"Come on!" Yang Ji had just withstood its most powerful crushing blow. At this moment, he was not afraid, and immediately employed the 'Sword Shadow Mirage' technique from the Flowing Water Sword Art. He rotated the flying sword clockwise with his wrist. Sword shadows overlapped, and a vortex of sword qi protected his entire body, ready to shred everything.
