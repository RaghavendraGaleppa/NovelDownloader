# Chapter 587: The Method of Falsely Holding a Fruit Position

The vast, residual origin energy from his Foundation Establishment peak cultivation, along with the immortal spiritual resonance bearing the fortune of the Heavenly Court, now surged toward Xu Yunfan like a flood released from a dam, all driven by the Heaven and Earth Confrontation of Yin and Yang Separation and Union Sutra.

*Whoosh!*

The aura manifested by the Heavenly Empress shattered into pieces amidst the violent currents of Yin and Yang.

As the technique circulated, it mixed with the refined spiritual power mobilized from her body, creating a breathtakingly beautiful scene.

Xu Yunfan's spiritual power circulated within him.

A bone-piercing coldness seeped into his marrow, while a heart-melting heat seemed to liquefy his soul. These two extreme sensations, forced into conflict, transformed into a violent torrent of energy. Instead of harming Xu Yunfan, they were converted by the sutra, continuously scouring his four limbs and bones, refining the nascent form of his inner world, and nourishing his recently advanced soul.

Meanwhile, the violently conflicting energy rampaged within the Heavenly Empress's body, continuously extracting and refining the Yin Essence she had cultivated for many years.

Her once-proud eyes, which had once looked down upon all living things, were now unfocused and vacant.

"Ah..."

As the technique operated, the Heavenly Empress's mind completely scattered.

Xu Yunfan paid her no mind, utterly indifferent.

He was a warrior.

To him, the Heavenly Empress's Foundation Establishment peak cultivation, her flesh and soul, and even her true spirit imprint had all been integrated into the Star Banner, becoming a part of his power. Now, he was simply maximizing the use of her remaining value.

The tyrannical nature of the *Heaven and Earth Confrontation of Yin and Yang Separation and Union Sutra* lay precisely here: everything belonging to the cauldron became his nourishment. If he were to advance further, he could naturally absorb all things in heaven and earth as his own nourishment. This step was within reach.

When the last trace of refined Yin Essence was completely devoured by Xu Yunfan, the Heavenly Empress, as if her bones had been pulled out, collapsed limply onto the cold star sand. Her body was covered in red marks and faint traces of lightning burns as she stared blankly at the shattered sky, gasping for breath, her aura withering to the extreme.

The already damaged Immortal Foundation within her completely dimmed, like a dying candle in the wind, on the verge of extinguishing at any moment.

However, the Star Spirit Banner was best at nurturing souls and nourishing Yin energy. Given some time, she would recover completely, ready to be plundered once more.

Xu Yunfan let out a long breath. The violent Yin and Yang energy around him suddenly retracted, and a brilliant light shone from his eyes. The exhaustion from his previous cultivation was swept away, replaced by an indescribable sense of clarity and comfort.

His spiritual power flowed as easily as moving his arms, becoming even more seamless and unimpeded. The Foundation Establishment late stage he had just broken through was completely stabilized through this Yin and Yang harmonization, even advancing a small step further. The lightning starlight within the nascent form of his inner world appeared even more lively.

'You have cultivated the *Heaven and Earth Confrontation of Yin and Yang Separation and Union Sutra* and gained immense benefits. Proficiency has increased significantly.'

'You have used...'

On his attribute panel, the proficiency for the *Heaven and Earth Confrontation of Yin and Yang Separation and Union Sutra* had even broken through a small realm due to the plundering of a Foundation Establishment peak cultivator.

From living beings to inanimate objects, given time, he could naturally absorb the essence of all things for his own use.

A classic energy-absorbing technique.

I love it!

Xu Yunfan clenched his fist slightly, and the air in his palm let out a low, muffled boom.

"The effect is acceptable."

He glanced at the Heavenly Empress, who was瘫软 on the ground with empty eyes, and with a sweep of his sleeve, turned her into a stream of light and put her back into the Star Spirit Banner.

随后，徐云帆将心神沉入幡内空间。
Subsequently, Xu Yunfan sank his mind into the space within the banner.

In the deep, dark world of the banner, stars dotted the sky.

He bypassed the various Star Lords and directly cast his divine sense onto the core region of the banner.

There, a palm-sized, moon-wheel-shaped treasure mirror floated silently, its entire body flowing with a water-like, cool moonlight.

This was the manifestation of the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit, the innate Taiyin Treasure Mirror.

A Dao Fruit!

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh. It was truly extravagant.

Not to mention Foundation Establishment true cultivators, even for a Golden Core True Lord, like the Qingyuan True Lord who had just entered the Golden Core stage, it would be difficult to obtain a Dao Fruit.

It was truly a grand treasure.

Xu Yunfan rubbed his hands together like a fly.

His divine sense cautiously approached the treasure mirror.

In the next instant, a vast, cold, and all-pervading aura washed over him.

The surface of the mirror did not reflect the scenery within the banner; instead, it contained a slowly rotating microcosm of stars, profound and abysmal. It seemed capable of illuminating all illusions, seeing through to the true origin, and reflecting the trajectories of past and future karmic flows.

A treasure!

A true treasure that seizes the creations of heaven and earth!

Xu Yunfan's eyes were filled with awe and astonishment.

This innate Dao Fruit manifestation contained the ultimate mysteries of the Taiyin laws of a celestial realm. If he could completely refine and control it, its power would be immeasurable, almost equivalent to wielding a portion of the authority of the Taiyin Dao Fruit.

For any cultivator, this temptation was fatal.

However, the fervor in his heart lasted only a moment before being forcefully suppressed by immense rationality.

After weighing the pros and cons, Xu Yunfan naturally did not want to rashly refine this Taiyin Treasure Mirror, lest he be influenced by it.

As one of the supreme orthodoxies in the Taihua Lingxu Realm, the Dao Fruit system of the Primordial Origin Sect was far more profound and complete than that of this damaged Heavenly Realm.

The *Celestial Jade Clear Nine Firmaments Profound Vault Myriad Transformation Immortal Dao Fruit*, ranked among the top ten of the 108 Heavenly and Earthly Dao Fruits, was the ultimate manifestation of the fusion of Thunder Arts, Battle, Destruction, and Immortality. Its potential was limitless, and its upper limit was high enough to support his future dominance across the cosmos and his assault on a higher realm of cultivation.

How could the Taiyin Dao Fruit of this Heavenly Realm possibly compare?

The latter might be pure and wondrous, but it was ultimately a lower-realm Dao Fruit, inferior in status.

The mirror before him could be used as a powerful innate spiritual treasure, a tool to comprehend the Great Dao laws, perceive the flaws in divine abilities, and even serve as a supreme aid for practicing eye techniques and deducing secret arts. But it absolutely could not be used as his own foundational Dao Fruit.

Once he coveted this "fast and easy" power and refined this treasure as the core of his own Dao Fruit, he would be cutting himself off from the path to the Great Dao of the Taihua Lingxu Realm.

By then, the fact that he had devoured a Dao Fruit in the Heavenly Realm would be known to all. Not only would the Golden Core True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect not let him off, but he himself would also be forever trapped outside the Dao system of the Taihua Lingxu Realm, becoming a rootless duckweed.

This was not the act of a wise man.

Only by abandoning the bait can one catch the true dragon.

Xu Yunfan's eyes regained their clarity.

Besides, even if he didn't forge a Dao Fruit, as long as he found a way to refine a magic treasure capable of containing it, he could still falsely hold the Fruit Position and temporarily wield the power of a True Lord.

With the power of a True Lord in his possession, who could stop him? This might just be his greatest guarantee for seeking the Golden Core and attaining the Dao.

After all, the difficulty in achieving the Golden Core realm lies not with fellow Foundation Establishment cultivators, but with the True Lords.

He withdrew his divine sense from the treasure mirror, forcefully suppressing the urge to refine it.

The time and place were not suitable.

The use of this item should be planned slowly. He would wait until he returned to the sect or found an absolutely safe and secret place before conducting in-depth research.

His current priority was to use it to assist himself in condensing his own Immortal Golden Nature!
