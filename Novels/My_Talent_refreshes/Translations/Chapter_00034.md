# Chapter 34: Forced Purchase

At first, when Chu Ning heard that delicate voice, he didn't realize it was calling him.

It wasn't until the voice spoke again.

"Is that Junior Brother Chu Ning from the Spiritual Plantation Hall? Could you stop for a moment?"

Chu Ning looked up in surprise.

He saw a petite female disciple in a green sect robe approaching him quickly from not far to his right.

Though small in stature, her chest was noticeably full and ample.

The female disciple came up to Chu Ning and, tilting her head slightly upward, asked with a smile,

"Are you Chu Ning from the Spiritual Plantation Hall?"

Chu Ning was puzzled as to how she knew him but nodded nonetheless.

"My name is Mu Ling, I'm also a disciple of the Hundred Arts Hall. Senior Brother Zhuang Yunde asked me to wait for you here."

Hearing this, Chu Ning understood and cupped his hands in a respectful bow.

"Greetings, Senior Sister Mu."

As he lowered his head, he happened to meet Mu Ling's sparkling eyes fixed intently on him, which made him wonder inwardly.

This senior sister seemed unusually interested in him.

But with his displayed cultivation at the third level of Qi Refining, there was nothing particularly noteworthy about him.

After all, Chu Ning's Qi Observation Technique couldn't discern her cultivation level, indicating she was at least at the sixth level of Qi Refining or above.

While he was still pondering, Mu Ling quickly spoke up.

"Junior Brother Chu, are you here to submit talisman paper as part of the Ink Spirit Bamboo harvest?"

Chu Ning nodded again, now convinced that Zhuang Yunde had indeed informed her about him.

"That's perfect. You can hand the talisman paper to me. Senior Brother Zhuang is out right now, so giving it to me is the same."

As she spoke, Mu Ling eyed the cloth bag in Chu Ning's hand and reached out eagerly.

Hearing this, Chu Ning immediately grew wary and hesitantly replied,

"This... Senior Sister, Senior Brother Zhuang specifically instructed me to hand the talisman paper to him personally to offset the harvest with the hall."

"Giving it to me would also offset the harvest," Mu Ling retorted, frowning.

"Do you think I would embezzle something from a new disciple like you?"

Not necessarily.

Chu Ning thought to himself, sensing something off about the situation.

However, he was unwilling to hand the talisman paper to Mu Ling just like that.

Not only was he unsure if she was truly from the Hundred Arts Hall, but even if she was, what if she didn't submit it to the hall or only submitted part of it?

"Senior Sister surely wouldn't take advantage of a new disciple like me, but I've only recently joined the sect and am unfamiliar with the rules. I'll come back another day when Senior Brother Zhuang is available. I wouldn't dare trouble you."

Mu Ling's expression immediately turned pouty upon hearing this, looking quite adorable.

Chu Ning noticed it but, considering she was after his talisman paper, he found it far from endearing.

Just then, Mu Ling quickly dropped her pouting expression and replaced it with a sweet smile.

"Junior Brother, how about this? I won't interfere with the talisman paper you're submitting to the sect, but you must have some extra, right?"

Before Chu Ning could respond, Mu Ling fixed her dark, gleaming eyes on him.

"Don't say you don't, or I'll just take it by force."

Chu Ning's expression stiffened slightly, and his grip on the cloth bag tightened.

Mu Ling's cultivation was clearly higher than his.

Moreover, she had boldly threatened to take it by force, as if ready to act at any moment.

This put him in a difficult position.

Seeing her threat had worked, Mu Ling smirked smugly and continued,

"Don't worry, I won't take it for free. I'll pay you in spirit stones.

"If you submit the talisman paper to the sect, it takes about 55 sheets to exchange for one low-grade spirit stone. But I'll give you one low-grade spirit stone for every 50 sheets."

Hearing she intended to buy them, Chu Ning relaxed slightly but asked skeptically,

"Senior Sister, one spirit stone for 50 sheets is the same rate as the sect or the market..."

"Never mind that. Let's just say I can't be bothered with the hassle," Mu Ling said impatiently.

"So, are you selling or not?"

Chu Ning sighed inwardly. With her tone, did he really have a choice?

If he refused, wouldn't she just take it by force?

"Senior Sister, how many sheets do you want to buy?" he asked.

"I'll take as many as you have!" Mu Ling declared grandly, waving her storage pouch.

"I've got plenty of spirit stones here."

Chu Ning looked at the spirit stones and lifted the smaller of the two cloth bags he was carrying, preparing to open it.

He had indeed brought extra talisman paper this time, originally intending to ask Zhuang Yunde if the sect would buy them back.

After all, claiming he had made none beyond the required amount would be suspicious, but he didn't want to reveal too much.

The smaller bag contained 2,050 sheets—his supposed surplus—which he planned to claim as his entire extra stock.

Now, he intended to separate the 550 sheets meant for Zhuang Yunde and give the rest to Mu Ling.

But before he could act, as soon as he opened the bag, Mu Ling swiftly formed a hand seal and whisked the entire bundle of talisman paper into her storage pouch.

Chu Ning's expression darkened slightly, but Mu Ling then took out a single sheet, examined it approvingly, and said,

"The quality is quite good. To prevent you from changing your mind, I'll just take them now."

She paused, seemingly sensing the contents of her storage pouch with her spiritual energy, then added,

"There are 2,050 sheets here, totaling 41 low-grade spirit stones."

With that, Mu Ling took out a small pile of spirit stones from her pouch and handed them to Chu Ning.

Chu Ning quickly accepted them and tucked them into his robe.

Seeing him stash the spirit stones directly into his clothing, Mu Ling asked curiously,

"Huh? Junior Brother, don't you have a storage pouch?"

Chu Ning shook his head. "This is my first harvest season. I don't have enough spirit stones to buy one."

Mu Ling blinked, then swiftly pulled out a small pouch from her robe and said,

"Junior Brother Chu, I happen to have an extra storage pouch.

"If you're willing to do me a small favor, I can give this pouch to you."

Chu Ning didn't respond. Such an unexpectedly generous offer seemed too good to be true.

Mu Ling didn't press him either and simply smiled.

"No need to answer now, Junior Brother. You should go see Senior Brother Zhuang first. I think I just saw him in his quarters."

With that, she turned and left, leaving Chu Ning bewildered.

After a moment's thought, Chu Ning continued toward Zhuang Yunde's residence.

Originally, he had planned to return to his quarters to fetch the 550 sheets meant for Zhuang Yunde before coming back.

But now that he'd heard Zhuang Yunde might actually be home, he decided to seek him out first.

Mu Ling's sudden appearance was strange. Though he hadn't lost out in this forced transaction, he wouldn't feel at ease until he clarified things with Zhuang Yunde.
