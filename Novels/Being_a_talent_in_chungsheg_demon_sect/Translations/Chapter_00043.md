# Chapter 43: The Blood-Robed Lord

The invasion by the Divine Martial Sect ended as abruptly as it began.

With Ouyang Haoze dead, Wu Zhichong and Duanmu Yuan didn't even dare to linger. Without a word, they turned and fled, as if a flood or ferocious beasts were chasing them.

In stark contrast to the Divine Martial Sect's hurried retreat, Skull Mountain Market City erupted in joyous celebration. After this battle, the Skull Mountain Market City was as solid as a fortress. As long as a Foundation Establishment True Human didn't personally intervene, the Divine Martial Sect would find it impossible to shake this defensive shell. As for the corpse tide, that was merely a minor ailment, not worth mentioning.

In short, it was safe!

A safe market city was bound to become a hub of wealth. One could easily imagine that trade here would become more frequent in the future, bringing more opportunities to make money. Good days were still ahead!

However, the excitement belonged to others; Lu Yang only found their clamor annoying. He was still immersed in the heart palpitations he had just experienced, unable to fully recover. For a long time, or rather, ever since Xiao Shiye was lured away by that Lucky Daoist, Foundation Establishment True Humans had become a lingering shadow in Lu Yang's mind. When he realized that another Foundation Establishment True Human might be plotting against him, the joy of having just slain Ouyang Haoze instantly vanished. He subconsciously grasped the "Innate Primordial One Qi Divine Talisman" around his neck, and only after ensuring it was still functioning did his racing heart calm slightly.

"The Divine Talisman is still active, meaning they still can't calculate me."

Though he said this, the effectiveness of the Innate Primordial One Qi Divine Talisman had its limits. Strictly speaking, it didn't sever causality but merely obscured it, placing a layer of false karmic lines on Lu Yang to provide protection. Complete severance of causality would be too conspicuous. Thus, when a Foundation Establishment True Human attempted to divine his fate, they wouldn't find nothing; instead, they would calculate a flawless yet entirely false result. The advantage of this was greater concealment, but the drawback was the inability to completely shield himself from the influence of Foundation Establishment True Humans.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang already had an answer in his heart: "So, the other party wasn't specifically targeting me, but rather I was accidentally drawn into their scheme?"

This would also explain the matter of the Profound Yin Treasure Jade. It wasn't that he was extraordinarily lucky, but that someone had deliberately delivered this item into his hands, intending to use him to achieve some ulterior motive. "What purpose?"

Lu Yang shifted his gaze to Ouyang Haoze's corpse, then waved his Ten Thousand Spirits Banner, drawing the bisected body over. Perhaps he could obtain some clues from this man. Besides, as a true disciple of the Divine Martial Sect, Ouyang Haoze's collection was bound to be extensive!

Soon, Ouyang Haoze's corpse was refined into the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner. However, because the body was split in two, the extracted True Spirit was incomplete. The Ten Thousand Spirits Banner's ability to retain a Banner Spirit's battle prowess, memories, and consciousness usually depended on the corpse's integrity. The better preserved the corpse, the closer the Banner Spirit was to its living state, like Liu Xin. As for Ouyang Haoze, Lu Yang only managed to preserve about seventy percent of his original state.

Nevertheless, he still learned many secrets.

"So this was the Divine Martial Sect's true objective."

"There's an ancient Witch-Ghost Dao secret realm within Skull Mountain, and the Yin Qi in the ley lines beneath Skull Mountain leaks from that very secret realm."

"The Divine Martial Sect wants to monopolize this secret realm, which is why they planned to eliminate the Sacred Sect's market city here."

"This is good news. If it's reported back to the Sacred Sect, I'll surely receive a good amount of contribution points, and the Sacred Sect will send reinforcements."

"Though monopolizing this information would bring greater benefits... why should I monopolize it?"

"Anyway, I don't plan to delve into that Witch-Ghost secret realm. It's better to hand it over to the Sacred Sect, steadily earn some contribution points, and watch others fight to the death!"

With this thought, Lu Yang relaxed. Having learned that a Foundation Establishment True Human was secretly plotting behind the scenes at Skull Mountain, he became even more resolute in his decision to stay hidden within the market city and absolutely not venture outside.

Next, Lu Yang began to sort through Ouyang Haoze's belongings. Just as he picked up Ouyang Haoze's storage bag, a round mirror trembled and floated over, affectionately rubbing against his hand when it got close. It was none other than the Grand Empyrean Mirror. This spirit treasure behaved like an eager little dog, circling Lu Yang and even bouncing twice, its movements filled with a desire to pledge loyalty.

"Are you abandoning the light for darkness?" Lu Yang was quite surprised. To be honest, for such a Supreme Yang Spirit Treasure to pledge allegiance to him, a demonic cultivator, it seemed Ouyang Haoze had truly hurt it deeply.

Seeing Lu Yang's attention finally fall upon it, the Grand Empyrean Mirror first shone a light on the storage bag in Lu Yang's hand, then swayed left and right. Subsequently, a slightly childish voice, like that of a newborn child who had just learned to speak, sounded in Lu Yang's mind:

"They... no good!"

Then, the Grand Empyrean Mirror itself burst forth with a strong light, swaying up and down again, and its voice changed, imbued with an innate pride and confidence:

"I... am good!"

It was offering itself! Lu Yang's eyes widened in amazement. Although he knew that spirit treasures possessed their own sentience and were incredibly wondrous, this was the first time he had witnessed it firsthand.

"Alright, then I'll use you first." Lu Yang beckoned, and the Grand Empyrean Mirror immediately flew to him. With its cooperation, he quickly gained complete mastery over every aspect of the spirit treasure.

"Good! Truly a good treasure!" Lu Yang's face was full of pleasant surprises. The spirit treasure lived up to its reputation!

It was well-known that a Qi Condensation Grand Perfection cultivator was one who had cultivated their internal Qi seed to its limit, thereby transforming it into a "Perfected True Qi." For example, his "Nine Transformations Dragon Art," upon reaching Qi Condensation Grand Perfection, would transform into a "True Dragon Fiend Qi." In other words, Perfected True Qi was the hallmark of Qi Condensation Grand Perfection and their strongest means of suppressing all Qi Condensation cultivators below that realm. However, the Grand Empyrean Mirror, this spirit treasure, inherently possessed a Perfected True Qi called "Grand Empyrean Wind-Thunder Qi"! In other words, as long as one wielded this spirit treasure, even with only Qi Condensation Layer One cultivation, they could rival a Qi Condensation Grand Perfection cultivator while activating the treasure!

"But this spirit treasure seems to have quite a few restrictions..." Lu Yang examined the Grand Empyrean Mirror. Treasures were meant to be used by people, even in the righteous path. The Grand Empyrean Mirror evidently contained many restrictions limiting its actions. Therefore, if he were to use this spirit treasure in front of a Divine Martial Sect disciple, the other party might just chant an incantation, and the Grand Empyrean Mirror would fly back to them. This had nothing to do with the Grand Empyrean Mirror's will; it was entirely a safeguard left by the artifact refiner.

"It would be too wasteful if I couldn't use such a spirit treasure..." Lu Yang pondered for a moment, then his eyes suddenly lit up. Although his formation skills weren't enough to break the restrictions within the mirror, there wasn't a compromise solution either.

The next second, Lu Yang shook the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner, resummoning Ouyang Haoze. Then, he refined Ouyang Haoze into a wisp of "Primordial One Qi" and injected it into the Grand Empyrean Mirror. By having him control Ouyang Haoze, and Ouyang Haoze then control the Grand Empyrean Mirror, he could bypass the mirror's restrictions.

Boom!

Instantly, the Grand Empyrean Mirror in Lu Yang's hand erupted with dazzling precious light. Within the light, sounds of wind and thunder could be faintly heard, and its power had clearly reached Qi Condensation Grand Perfection!

"...It really works!"

Lu Yang let out a joyful laugh, then hung the Grand Empyrean Mirror behind his head. At once, even the precious light it emitted turned crimson, stained with his color.

"Excellent! Excellent!"

Lu Yang chuckled contentedly, then put away the Grand Empyrean Mirror and opened Ouyang Haoze's storage bag. The surge of spiritual energy made his eyes narrow slightly. Inside, a massive amount of spirit stones was piled up! Besides those, there were various precious elixirs, magic treasures, and materials. Lu Yang roughly calculated that selling them to the Sacred Sect would be worth at least thirty thousand contribution points.

"Truly a windfall... too bad there probably won won't be another chance." After all, with Ouyang Haoze as a precedent, no one below the Foundation Establishment realm would likely dare to challenge his formation again.

*When the news of the Witch-Ghost secret realm spreads, Skull Mountain will surely see another storm of bloodshed... There must be a Foundation Establishment True Human secretly plotting behind all this.*

*But as long as I don't go out and don't get involved in this mess... unless he personally makes a move, what can he do to me?*

Lu Yang made up his mind. He then put away all the items, deactivated the formation, and rode a streak of light back to the market city, landing on the platform of the Blood-Robed Tower.

From that day forward, Skull Mountain fell into an eerie calm. The Divine Martial Sect continued to send more personnel, and reinforcements from the Initial Sacred Sect arrived one after another, yet outwardly there was not the slightest disturbance. Only undercurrents surged behind the scenes.

Under these circumstances, Lu Yang's deeds somehow spread and became widely known. Joining the Sacred Sect as a mortal ten years ago, making a fortune by speculating on substitute yin puppets, cultivating in seclusion for ten years to break through to the late Qi Condensation realm, becoming a Formation Master, and then slaying a true disciple of the Divine Martial Sect, a Qi Condensation Grand Perfection cultivator—such an inspiring story of a commoner's rise practically gave all ordinary disciples of the Sacred Sect a shot in the arm. Gradually, out of respect and awe, many people no longer referred to Lu Yang by his name. Instead, they adopted another honorific:

"The Blood-Robed Lord"!
