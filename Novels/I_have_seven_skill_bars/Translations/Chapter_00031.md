# Chapter 31: Pay Extra

Ding Rui had to ensure he hadn't revealed any clues, and then figure out how to deal with Yang Shou's theft of spirit rice!

"Senior Brother Ding, our spirit field has 666 plants!"
"Brother Rui, our spirit field has 555 plants."
"Our spirit field has 444, a lucky number, Senior Brother Ding! Come to our spirit field!"

As Ding Rui walked out of the gate of Spirit Field 377, shouts immediately rose one after another. Just then, a slightly familiar voice reached his ears.

"Ding Rui, come to our spirit field!"

Hearing this, Ding Rui turned his head and saw Li Yizhen not far from the crowd, cupping her hands around her mouth like a megaphone, shouting the same thing.

Li Yizhen had originally intended to be more aloof, but there were too many people and the noise was too great. Her previous quiet calls hadn't reached Ding Rui at all. So, she had no choice but to concede, as eradicating the large aphids in the spirit field was ultimately more important.

"Of course not!" Ding Rui said anxiously. "If it were just about handling the large aphids, I'd come back later. But right now, I have something far more important to do. I need to go find Senior Brother Mu first."

Hearing the name "Senior Brother Mu," Li Yizhen immediately understood that Ding Rui wasn't lying; he likely had genuinely urgent matters. She quickly said, "Then you go ahead? Do you need any help?"

"No need. You head back to your spirit field. Once I'm done with my business, I'll come help you deal with those aphids!" Ding Rui finished, bid farewell to Li Yizhen, and directly rushed towards Mu Tian's location.

As he ran halfway, he suddenly encountered Ma Wen, who was casually strolling along.

Ding Rui was overjoyed and called out, "Brother Ma, quickly, give me a ride!"

"Are you in a hurry?"

"Very urgent!"

"Then it'll cost extra!"

"..."

In the end, Ma Wen successfully got his extra payment.

Since Ding Rui became famous in the spirit field district, Ma Wen, who frequently transported people, had heard of Ding Rui's reputation. He already knew Ding Rui was someone who wasn't short on money, so finding an opportunity now, he naturally wanted to earn a little more.

Ding Rui, at the moment, was in no mood to quibble over such things.

"Faster! Hurry, Brother Ma! Run faster!"

"Then I can get double the money!" Ma Wen thought gleefully, then couldn't help but shout, "Need a ride?"

Mu Tian, with Ding Rui in tow, rushed all the way and stopped by Ma Wen.

"Are you two in a hurry?" Ma Wen asked.

"At your fastest speed," Mu Tian said, mounting the horse.

"Gotta pay extra!"

"You won't be short-changed!"

...

"Run faster! Even faster, at your top speed!" Mu Tian shouted.

Because Ding Rui couldn't guarantee whether he had alerted the enemy, Mu Tian was extremely worried that Ding Rui might have been discovered, and that Yang Shou would consequently inflict even greater damage on the spirit field.

"This is... already... my fastest..." Ma Wen panted, out of breath.
