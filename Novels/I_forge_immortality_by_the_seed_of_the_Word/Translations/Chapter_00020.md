# Chapter 20: Longze Market and the "Some Artifact Shop"

Under Zhang Jing's astonished gaze, the Frost Blade Technique—now infused with a trace of the Dark Python Devours Void Dao Rhyme—transformed into a nimble crystalline serpent midair. It slithered about, continuously absorbing spiritual energy from its surroundings, its sharp edges condensed to an extreme degree.

Without a sound, the technique effortlessly sliced through the stone wall of the training chamber and continued flying forward unabated. A slash mark far more exaggerated than before abruptly appeared in Zhang Jing's field of vision.

"One, two, three!" he silently counted in his heart.

This time, the Frost Blade Technique only dissipated after piercing through four stone walls, its spiritual energy completely exhausted.

The same spell, yet the difference was night and day—all because one version was enhanced by Dao Rhyme while the other wasn't. Zhang Jing couldn't help but fall into deep thought.

What exactly was Dao Rhyme?

From what he'd observed so far, it could attract and mobilize spiritual energy while amplifying spell power—and this was just from an incomplete fragment of the Dark Python Devours Void Dao Rhyme. Without the corresponding legacy, Zhang Jing could only mechanically utilize this incomplete Dao Rhyme.

Of course, he had tried using his Mind's Eye Dao Seed to analyze and comprehend the fragment, but to no avail. He knew the "what" but not the "why"—this was Zhang Jing's current state.

"I still need a top-tier cultivation method," he sighed deeply before sitting back down on the meditation cushion and closing his eyes.

After casting the Frost Blade Technique twice consecutively, only a faint wisp of spiritual energy remained in his dantian. However, Zhang Jing noticed this wisp was undergoing subtle changes, with dim spiritual particles occasionally dispersing from it.

He immediately realized this was one effect of the Gathering Essence Spiritual Light—the spiritual energy in his dantian was being purified, and the progress was remarkably noticeable. Of course, this was partly because his dantian currently held so little spiritual energy. Still, the efficacy of the Gathering Essence Spiritual Light was evident. If this trend continued, Zhang Jing had no doubt that given enough time, he could advance directly from Qi Refinement Layer One to Layer Nine without encountering any bottlenecks.

The reason was simple—his spiritual energy was becoming purer than pure.

With his breakthrough into Qi Refinement, the true power of the Gathering Essence Spiritual Light was finally revealing itself. Considering its long-term effects, Zhang Jing even felt it wasn't far inferior to his Mind's Eye Dao Seed. This made him all the more curious about what new effects the Pure Essence Breathing Meditation Technique might gain upon reaching level four—a goal that wasn't too distant.

Snapping back to reality, Zhang Jing remembered another equally important matter. His gaze shifted to:

[Five Organs Water Origin Guide - Uninitiated (65/70)]

His heartbeat quickened as he immediately immersed himself in cultivation.

By midnight, through Zhang Jing's diligent efforts, the final five experience points were finally completed. His body trembled slightly as a flood of insights about the Five Organs' Spiritual Consciousness and the cycle of the Five Elements suddenly emerged in his mind.

Subconsciously, Zhang Jing began circulating the Five Organs Water Origin Guide. Instantly, the phantom image of a strange, looping river slowly materialized within his body, connecting his five organs and spanning his six viscera, seemingly transforming them into a unified whole.

Wisps of spiritual energy from heaven and earth were drawn into his abdomen, instantly merging into the endlessly flowing river. Black, yellow, green, red, and white—the five colors of the Five Elements continuously circulated until the water element settled into pure black, exuding a profound and mysterious aura.

As the spiritual energy in the room was completely absorbed, an inky black strand of spiritual energy slowly flowed into his dantian. The pure white spiritual energy cultivated through the Pure Essence Breathing Meditation Technique began to be silently assimilated by the black spiritual energy, merging into one.

"So this is the water-attribute spiritual energy cultivated through the Five Organs Water Origin Guide? How domineering!" Zhang Jing marveled inwardly.

The mysterious jade talisman flickered faintly:

[Five Organs Water Origin Guide - Level 1 (1/150)]
Skill Trait: Five Methods Spiritual River (Intermediate)

Before dawn, Zhang Jing awoke from cultivation, sensing the fluctuations of spiritual energy in his dantian. An involuntary bright smile spread across his face.

It truly lived up to its superior compatibility rating. When cultivating the Five Organs Water Origin Guide, it felt as natural as moving his own limbs. Moreover, as a mid-grade cultivation method, its efficiency far surpassed that of basic techniques. After just one night of cultivation, Zhang Jing could already feel a noticeable improvement in his cultivation base.

Standing up, he suddenly remembered his plan to visit the market today to purchase magical artifacts. His gaze unconsciously fell upon the pouch on the table.

Inside were forty-five spirit stones—twenty-five from his share of the wager won from Ji Bochang, and the remaining twenty were the compensation stones given by Wu Mingyuan yesterday.

"Quite generous indeed," Zhang Jing remarked. Twenty spirit stones were nearly equivalent in value to a magical artifact—albeit a low-grade one—and significantly alleviated his financial constraints. At the very least, it gave him more options when selecting artifacts today.

"Should I prioritize defensive artifacts or offensive ones?" Zhang Jing pondered. "Logically, preserving my life comes first, so defensive artifacts would be the obvious choice. But flying swords are also quite tempting. Then again, the best defense is a good offense—if I encounter enemies, wouldn't it be better to make them beg for mercy rather than focus solely on protecting myself?"

He sighed. "Ah, if someone hesitates over every purchase, it's definitely because they're poor—case in point: me!"

Just as Zhang Jing was agonizing over his choices—

Knock knock—

"Brother Zhang, are you awake? It's time to go," Ji Bochang's voice called from outside the door.

"Just a moment, I'll be right there."

After a quick check, Zhang Jing headed straight for the door.

"Brother Zhang, you—you've achieved Qi Refinement?!"

"Just luck, just luck!"

"Luck?!" Ji Bochang's voice rose sharply. "You call this luck? Damn it all!"

"Brother Zhang, you didn't take resources from any mission team, nor did you have family support. With just that shoddy meditation cushion in your courtyard, you actually broke through to Qi Refinement in just a few days?"

At this moment, Ji Bochang felt his psyche had suffered a heavy blow.

"Brother Zhang, be honest with me—back at the Seventh Provisional Academy, were you hiding your progress in the meditation technique? Was I never actually first—was it you all along?"

"You're overthinking it," Zhang Jing said with a laugh.

"Brother Zhang, to be frank, I was going to share some good news with you. But seeing this, rest assured—I'll keep pestering my senior sister until she agrees!"

"Brother Ji, where exactly is this Longze Market?"

"Longze Market borders the Dragon Lake Dao Academy, a sacred land of immortal cultivation. Legend has it the market is backed by a major figure from the academy, so few rogue cultivators dare cause trouble here."

"Child, we're safe now!" whispered a gaunt, elderly man in his sixties to the four- or five-year-old boy beside him. The boy kept his head slightly lowered, his expression weary.

Hearing this, the boy looked up cautiously into the old man's eyes. "Grandpa, you're not lying to me again, are you?"

The old man chuckled. "Why would I lie? Look for yourself!" He pointed ahead.

Following the direction, the boy saw a massive archway towering over thirty meters high, majestic and imposing, exuding an immovable, mountain-like aura.

Beyond the archway stretched a sprawling complex of buildings spanning several miles, bustling with activity. At the center of the archway, the characters for "Longze Market" danced like soaring dragons yet stood firm as if rooted to the earth.

After just a few glances, the boy's vision blurred, and he seemed to see a colossal sword descending upon him. Startled, he quickly averted his eyes.

"Foolish child, don't stare at those characters for too long," the old man scolded. "They were written by a sword immortal from the Dao Academy. Gaze at them too long, and you might trigger the sword intent within."

"Yes, Grandpa," the boy replied obediently.

"Child, do you want to become as powerful as the sword immortal who wrote those characters someday?"

The old man patted the boy's head with a smile.

"I do!"

The old man laughed heartily again, one hand touching a bundle tucked inside his robe. "Grandpa will definitely get you into the Dao Academy to cultivate! Once that happens, our little one will be extraordinary. This old man can die in peace then."

"Grandpa, don't die! I've already lost Mother and Father—you're all I have left." The boy hugged the old man's leg, his voice trembling.

"Alright, alright, Grandpa won't die. I still need to see you marry a fairy!"

As they spoke, the old man led the boy into the market. Only then did his tense heart begin to relax—they were truly safe now.

The next step was to contact a high-ranking figure from the Dao Academy and present this ancient legacy in exchange for his grandson's chance to enter the academy.

As for why he didn't cultivate the legacy himself before teaching it to his grandson—the old man, though an early-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, practiced a crude and incomplete method that left him utterly incapable of comprehending the profound truths within this precious legacy. Cultivation was out of the question.

He had considered seeking guidance from other cultivators but quickly abandoned the idea. The rogue cultivators he knew who possessed complete cultivation legacies were all powerful figures in their own right. Wealth could tempt the heart, let alone a precious cultivation legacy.

Thus, after much deliberation, the old man decided to offer the legacy to a Dao Academy elder. He believed this could secure his grandson's future.

Though the boy had already cultivated a meditation technique and awakened spiritual sense—technically disqualifying him from academy admission—desperate times had called for desperate measures.

Unbeknownst to them, four pairs of cold eyes watched the grandfather and grandson from a distance.

"They've entered the market. We can't act there."

"We can't abandon the legacy!"

"Then we'll risk it! Eldest Brother, I'll enter first and force them out. Once they're outside, we'll seize the legacy. If even one of us succeeds, it'll be a meritorious deed for our family for generations!"

"Agreed!"

At the entrance of Longze Market, Zhang Jing rubbed his sore neck, his eyes still reflecting awe.

"What a towering archway—no, gatehouse!"

Moreover—

Zhang Jing glanced at Ji Bochang ahead, feeling somewhat exasperated. So the Longze Market was right next to the Dao Academy? From their residence to the market was merely a two-hour journey. With spiritual energy enhancing their speed, the round trip wouldn't even take an hour.

And here he'd thought it would take days!

"Brother Zhang, do you know who backs this market?" Ji Bochang asked smugly.

Ever since realizing Zhang Jing's cultivation talent far surpassed his own, Ji Bochang had changed. Now, he took every opportunity to flaunt his knowledge of the cultivation world, as if to regain some semblance of balance in their dynamic.

Zhang Jing didn't mind—who would refuse a free guide?

"Do tell!"

"Opinions vary among outside cultivators about who supports Longze Market. Some even say it's backed by a major figure from the Dao Academy."

"Isn't that the case?" Zhang Jing asked curiously. A market spanning miles with countless cultivators coming and going—the profits must be enormous. Only someone powerful could maintain order here.

"Well, that's not entirely wrong. It is backed by major figures—just not a single one. My senior sister told me the market is actually supported by the top ten mission teams from our outer academy."

"You mean—"

"Exactly—the top ten powerhouse teams and the senior brothers and sisters who entered the inner academy from those teams."

"No wonder..."

Zhang Jing suddenly understood.

Just then, rapid footsteps approached from behind. A large and small figure rushed past them.

Zhang Jing's gaze swept over the pair. At first glance, he noticed issues—unstable foundations, impure spiritual energy. Either their cultivation method was flawed, or they'd made mistakes in practice. And how had that child awakened spiritual consciousness?

What was their story?

Though curious, Zhang Jing didn't pry, simply continuing to follow Ji Bochang.

"Brother Zhang, should I take you to see the magical artifacts first?" Ji Bochang turned back to ask.

"Much obliged."

"It's no trouble."

Under Ji Bochang's guidance, they entered the market and immediately veered into a side alley, twisting and turning as if navigating a maze.

After some time:

"We're here." Ji Bochang pointed to an antique-looking shop ahead. "Their artifacts are reasonably priced and decent quality—good enough for your assessment. Once you officially enter the outer academy, you'll probably outgrow market-grade artifacts anyway."

Zhang Jing looked where indicated.

"'Some Artifact Shop'?"

He chuckled—the shopkeeper certainly had a sense of humor.
