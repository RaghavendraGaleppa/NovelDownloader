# Chapter 71: Making a Move

After taking a Solid Foundation Pill, Zhou Qing felt the medicinal effects take hold and was somewhat satisfied. While it was indeed less effective than a seventh-grade Blood Qi Pill, it surpassed the sixth-grade version. 

The true value of the Solid Foundation Pill lay in its ability to "consolidate the foundation and nourish vitality," working subtly over time rather than simply boosting blood qi.

"At the earliest one year, at the latest two—that should be when I break through to the Innate Realm. One pill a month is enough; any more would have diminishing returns. From now on, I'll also need to periodically cleanse my internal organs through fasting, as the Daoist texts prescribe. This is crucial for advancing to the Innate Realm."

Zhou Qing had consumed many pills over time. While they served as valuable accumulation before his breakthrough, the residual impurities they left behind also posed obstacles. 

In truth, this wasn't unique to pills—even ordinary food caused similar issues. With his Five Organs Thunder Resonance technique and proper fasting methods, he could periodically purify his organs, allowing him to reach greater heights and maintain them longer.

"Summer is approaching, and the mountains are teeming with life. I should explore them for rare herbs, perhaps even ingredients for the Beauty Preservation Pill."

The Rejuvenation Talisman Canon, a remnant of the Evergreen Immortality Technique, contained a formula for the Beauty Preservation Pill. Regardless of gender, those who took it could maintain their youthful appearance. 

However, two of its ingredients were exceedingly rare. 

One was a flower called "Heavenly Wood Fragrance," which bloomed only once every thirty years during the transition from spring to summer. Missing the bloom meant waiting another thirty years, and the flowers wilted within a day of being picked, making preservation nearly impossible.

The other ingredient was stalactite essence over a thousand years old. Zhou Qing had managed to collect a small amount of this. 

The pill itself wasn't difficult to refine—the real challenge was obtaining the Heavenly Wood Fragrance. According to Qingfu Palace records, this herb grew deep in the western mountains, and not just one plant existed.

The Beauty Preservation Pill only preserved facial youthfulness without extending lifespan or slowing bodily aging. Still, it was incredibly valuable. Zhou Qing hoped to find the ingredients, refine a batch, and give one to Song Youxian while keeping the rest for future use.

He also planned to take his rooster, Wǎngrì, into the mountains. The bird seemed to have a natural talent for finding rare herbs. Though its abilities were less effective in winter when the mountains were barren, Zhou Qing remained curious about where it had previously found the snake it caught.

Zhou Qing returned to the city and learned from Song Youxian that an important figure had been waiting for him for three days while he was herb-gathering.

The visitor turned out to be Song You, the son of Provincial Governor Song He—Zhou Qing's former examiner during the provincial exams. 

"Brother Song, I've heard of your reputation," Zhou Qing greeted politely. "Let's speak frankly. The disappearance of Commander Gu Fan—that must be your doing, no?"

Song You's teacup slipped, spilling tea on his robes. He hadn't expected Zhou Qing to admit it so readily.

"My father has always thought highly of you," Song You said after composing himself. "If you're willing to join us, he can offer protection for you and those close to you. Past matters can be forgotten, and you won't need to fear retaliation from the third young master of the Shang family."

Zhou Qing smiled. "Thank you for the offer, but please convey my regards to Governor Song. As my examiner, I owe him gratitude. If he ever faces difficulties, a single letter will bring my aid. But should we ever find ourselves on opposing sides, I'll respectfully withdraw."

Song You sighed. "Brother Zhou, one man alone can't survive these turbulent times. Jiangzhou isn't large—I urge you to reconsider."

"The Shang family's third young master should be the one worrying about me seeking him out," Zhou Qing replied calmly.

Song You left soon after, realizing persuasion was futile.

Meanwhile, in the Shang family residence, Shang Bing stood with Tang Jingchuan, watching a demonstration of hidden weapons. 

A black-clad figure launched four throwing knives simultaneously, each striking vital points on a human-shaped target before embedding themselves in the rock behind.

"Marvelous! The 'One Flower, Four Petals' technique—truly worthy of the world's greatest hidden weapons master!" Shang Bing applauded.

Beside him, Tang Jingchuan looked on with quiet astonishment. 

"Brother Tang, I consider you my most trusted confidant," Shang Bing said. "I won't hide my intentions from you."

He introduced the black-clad man—the Passionless Daoist, ranked tenth on the Black List and renowned as the top hidden weapons expert.

"The target is Song Youxian of the Lin family in Jiangzhou," Shang Bing explained. "Her lover is Zhou Qing, the man who killed the Daoist's younger brother, the Fierce Tiger Daoist."

The Passionless Daoist had already scouted the Lin residence, planning to assassinate Song Youxian during Old Master Lin's birthday celebration. If successful, he might then seize the opportunity to eliminate Zhou Qing as well.

Tang Jingchuan inwardly sighed. He'd known getting involved with the Shang family was a mistake, but now it was too late to withdraw. 

Shang Bing, believing he'd secured Tang Jingchuan's loyalty, didn't notice his growing resolve to leave. That night, Tang Jingchuan decided to follow his mother's advice—to take the beast hide she'd left him and seek out the Abbot of the Tiger Subduing Temple in the capital.

On the day of Old Master Lin's birthday, the Passionless Daoist disguised himself as a wandering priest and infiltrated the outer courtyard's banquet, edging closer to the secluded garden where Song Youxian was seated.

Zhou Qing, Fushan, Fusong, and Zhang Jingxiu were also present, having come down from the mountain at Zhishan's suggestion. The two mad Daoists' conditions had improved slightly with prolonged exposure to the Calming Heart Chant, and Zhang Jingxiu thought exposure to worldly atmospheres might further stimulate their recovery.

Just as Zhou Qing raised his wine cup, a sudden sense of danger prickled his instincts. 

In the next instant, Zhou Qing, Fushan, Fusong, and Zhang Jingxiu simultaneously vaulted over the garden wall. 

Outside, a stocky Daoist screamed in agony as his limbs were torn from his body. 

The Passionless Daoist never even saw what hit him.

Back in Jiangzhou, Zhou Qing continued preparing for the coming upheavals. He trained Song Youxian and Butcher Hu in self-defense techniques, focusing on reflexive responses to assassinations. 

He also increased shipments of grain to Tang Jingyuan, knowing food would be critical in the turbulent times ahead.

Time flowed steadily onward as Zhou Qing edged ever closer to the Innate Realm. 

The world was changing. 

And with three Innate Realm experts at Qingfu Palace—even if two were mad—Zhou Qing knew Jiangzhou would remain secure. 

No ordinary faction could withstand the deterrence of decapitation strikes by Innate-level powerhouses. 

The era of relying solely on martial sects or local forces was ending. 

An Innate expert might not single-handedly defeat an army, but with such strength, assembling a formidable faction became effortless. 

Zhou Qing was nearly there. 

And when he arrived, the landscape would shift once more.
