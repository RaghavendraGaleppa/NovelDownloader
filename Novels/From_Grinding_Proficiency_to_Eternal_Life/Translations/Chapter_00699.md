Chapter 699: Remaking the Clone

“Reporting to True Lord, the Sect’s *Records of the Netherworld* states that the Sea of Bitterness, the boundary of life and death, is the place where all souls return to the Void. Within it, blood waves corrode the bones, Yin winds erode the soul, and temporal-spatial turbulence tears at the consciousness. Only by shedding the physical body can a wisp of true spirit traverse.”

He paused slightly before adding, “The ancient texts also say that only souls with confused true spirits can cross the Nether River. If a Golden Core True Lord forces his way through, he will inevitably trigger the backlash of the Sea of Bitterness. This is an iron law set by the Heavenly Dao to protect the order of reincarnation.”

Seeing Xu Yunfan deep in thought, Lu Chuan dared not delay and continued, “However, the Dao Fruit True Lord seeks, the Taiyin Mingqiu, this disciple has indeed seen its name in the remnants of the Qingyuan Mountain scrolls. The scroll states that this fruit hangs deep within the Sea of Bitterness, at the Eye of the Void. It is born of the Primordial Yin Source and forms a complementary Yin-Yang relationship with the Divine Thunder…”

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and asked casually, “Is it that obvious that this Lord seeks this Dao Fruit?”

Lu Chuan’s body trembled slightly. Not daring to hesitate, he hurriedly spoke.

“Please forgive me, True Lord. It is just that this disciple has undergone five cycles of reincarnation and has some insight into Yin-Yang and the Five Elements. I also know a thing or two about the Golden Core realm. I know that to reach the mid-stage of the Golden Core, one needs at least three Dao Fruits to form a small celestial cycle. Solitary Yang does not generate, and solitary Yin does not grow. True Lord has already formed Thunder and Fire; surely, you need a Taiyin Dao Fruit to harmonize the Dragon and Tiger. And that Taiyin Mingqiu Dao Fruit is indeed one of the best Yin-attributed Dao Fruits in the Taihua Spirit Void Realm.”

Looking at Lu Chuan prostrate on the ground, not daring to lift his head, Xu Yunfan was speechless but felt no anger.

Lu Chuan knew his intentions; how could those True Lords watching him not know? Moreover, in recent years, Xu Yunfan had been investigating Yin-attributed Dao Fruits, the Sea of Bitterness, and legends of the Netherworld. Any observant person would have their suspicions.

“Continue,” Xu Yunfan said.

Lu Chuan let out a sigh of relief internally.

“The end of the *Records of the Netherworld* has a commentary: ‘To seize the Yin Dragon, one must first cross the Nether Gate. Where does the Gate open? The soul will know upon return.’” He shook his head with a bitter smile. “This sentence is obscure. This disciple has contemplated it for a hundred years but could not understand it.”

At this moment, Chu Chengnan stepped forward, his black robe moving without wind, a look of reminiscence in his eyes.

“True Lord, the Nether Gate mentioned by Senior Brother Lu, this disciple has knocked upon it in all five of my lifetimes.”

He opened his palm, and a wisp of grayish-white death qi rose from it, condensing into a phantom door covered in cracks.

“This door is neither real nor illusory; it is a projection of the laws of reincarnation. After a cultivator undergoes Corpse Dissolution, their spirit disperses into heaven and earth. Only the true spirit, drawn by the Nether River, will naturally see this door standing by the Sea of Bitterness.”

His voice was heavy.

“In my first lifetime, when I perished, this door was still intact. However, in recent reincarnations, the cracks on the door have grown deeper. This is due to the Bodhisattva Pure Land’s Rebirth Pond and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect’s Severing Karma Sword forcibly seizing the authority of reincarnation. Now, to enter the Netherworld, one must use one’s spirit to withstand the temporal-spatial turbulence raging through the cracks in the door!”

Although Chu Chengnan did not mention the Primordial Origin Sect, Xu Yunfan understood that the Primordial Origin Sect naturally had its own rebirth methods, called the Reincarnation Platform. However, ninety-nine percent of the sect’s Foundation Establishment cultivators who undergo reincarnation generally do not use it. After all, going to the Reincarnation Platform clearly tells others where they have reincarnated.

Which Primordial Origin Sect cultivator doesn’t have a hundred or so enemies on their back? If their reincarnation location were known, the consequences would be disastrous. Moreover, many Foundation Establishment cultivators, after reincarnating, cut ties with their past identities to evade pursuit by enemies.

Xu Yunfan pondered thoughtfully. “So, in all five of your lifetimes, you were conscious and felt the pull of the Netherworld?”

Chu Chengnan shook his head. “Only four times. In my third lifetime, a sword spirit turbulence shattered thirty percent of my soul source, causing my past wisdom to be incomplete after reincarnation. It took a hundred years of bitter cultivation to recover my clarity.”

He looked up at Xu Yunfan. “True Lord, this Gate is everywhere, yet nowhere to be found. Only when the spirit leaves the body can one feel its call. However, True Lord has already formed your Golden Core, and your spirit is linked to your Dao Fruit. If you were to forcefully split your spirit to leave the body…”

Before Chu Chengnan could elaborate on the risks, Xu Yunfan understood his meaning.

If a Golden Core True Lord’s spirit leaves the body, it is naturally extremely dangerous. Without the physical body as a raft, it is perilous. Once an enemy finds out, who knows what chaos might ensue. However, there are many protective methods available.

Chu Chengnan and Lu Chuan bowed and withdrew from the Divine Thunder Palace. In the empty hall, only Xu Yunfan remained.

Purple and gold thunder patterns flowed across the jade pillars and floor, reflecting his face.

“Spirit leaving the body…” Xu Yunfan muttered to himself, his fingers unconsciously tapping the edge of the cloud platform.

A Golden Core True Lord’s spirit is connected to the Dao Fruit, like a towering tree rooted in the earth. Forcibly separating it is akin to severing one’s own foundation. The risk is too great. If one encounters a strong enemy or an unforeseen event in the Sea of Bitterness, the main body would suffer a severe injury. Furthermore, who knows how many eyes are watching from the shadows of the Taihua Spirit Void Realm, many of whom hope for his fall and covet his Dao Fruit.

The main body absolutely cannot be moved.

“It seems there is only this method left,” Xu Yunfan’s eyes flashed, and a plan had already formed in his heart.

He waved his long sleeve, and the space in front of him rippled slightly. A mountain of rare spiritual materials poured out from his spatial ring, landing on the cold, clean floor of the hall with a dull thud.

Spiritual light was brilliant, illuminating the palace.

Among them were treasures found in the ruins of the Heavenly Realm, such as World Void Stones containing spatial power and Star Silver flowing with star fragments. There were also thunderfire essences collected from the depths of the Divine Thunder Peak’s spiritual veins, such as Ten Thousand Year Thunderstruck Wood Core and Earthfire Melted Heart Jade. There were also treasures accumulated from earlier years, the dream of ordinary cultivators: Ten Thousand Year Warm Jade Marrow, Metal Element Primordial Qi, Profound Yin True Water…

The variety was dazzling, and spiritual energy was dense, almost piling up into a small mountain.

These were the spoils and accumulations of many years that he had gathered. Now, he took them all out to refine a clone capable of bearing this heavy responsibility.

Xu Yunfan held his breath and focused his mind. The aura around him suddenly converged, as if merging with the surrounding space.

The next moment, deep within his Dantian Qi Sea, the Golden Core phantom, which was purple-gold with red patterns and contained the power of the Thunderfire Dao Fruit, trembled slightly. A majestic and vast eight-colored cloud qi, almost connecting the sky and the earth, erupted violently.

Li Fire blazed like flowing magma, Kan Water was deep and dark like deep-sea ice, Gen Mountain was thick and heavy like a towering giant peak, Zhen Thunder was violent like a heavenly thunderbolt…

Eight types of mysterious cloud qi representing the primordial powers of heaven and earth churned and surged, instantly filling the entire hall and enveloping all the spiritual materials.

“Xuandu Eight Scenes, Refine Heaven and Create, Cloud Sutra Opens, Hold the Body, Hold the Tool!”

Xu Yunfan’s hand seals changed like lightning, and his Taoist chant resounded through the hall.

The true meaning of refining tools, derived from the perfection of the *Xuandu Eight Scenes Refine Heaven and Create Cloud Sutra*, was pushed to its limit by him.

Under his precise control, the eight-colored cloud qi became a torrent of creation with a life of its own.

Li Fire cloud qi transformed into a blazing divine flame, melting and purifying the hard ore and spiritual materials.

Kan Water cloud qi acted like the most precise carving knife, washing away impurities and sculpting the form.

Zhen Thunder cloud qi was responsible for activating the spirituality deep within the spiritual materials.

Xun Wind cloud qi guided the flow of energy, Kun Earth cloud qi stabilized the foundation, Qian Heaven cloud qi bestowed spiritual charm, Dui Marsh cloud qi harmonized conflicts, and Gen Mountain cloud qi solidified the shape…

Countless spiritual materials, under the melting and shaping of the Eight Scenes cloud qi, had their spiritual marrow extracted and purified, while their impurities were burned away.

At the core of the churning cloud qi, a human-shaped embryo, with an outline extremely similar to Xu Yunfan’s main body, was rapidly condensing and taking form.
