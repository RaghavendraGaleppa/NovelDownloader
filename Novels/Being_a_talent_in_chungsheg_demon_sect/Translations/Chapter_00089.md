# Chapter 89: Xiao Shiye

"If I can truly refine a Guardian Deity with False Foundation Establishment, it will be of immense help for my main body to break through to Foundation Establishment, increasing my chances by at least thirty percent!" Lv Yang sat cross-legged, pondering. "Not only that, but more importantly, the Guardian Deity will be complete with karma. If necessary, I can sever ties with it and effectively dump all the karma of the Witchghost Dao onto it."

"Though this means the fortune and cultivation gained from 'Stealing Heavenly Secrets' cannot be used for my own Foundation Establishment and must be invested in the Guardian Deity, with a Guardian Deity, coupled with my Three-Grade True Qi, [Corpse Exuvium Immortal], [Sage Thief], and [Thought-Severing Celestial Silkworm Secret], I still have a seventy percent chance of breaking through Foundation Establishment!" If he could also obtain the Ascension Token, that would be an eighty percent chance!

"Furthermore, according to Ancestor You, the more preparations one makes before Foundation Establishment, the higher their chances of success, and the greater the gains after breaking through."

"This pertains to the cultivation of the Foundation Establishment realm. Foundation Establishment is, in essence, a life-or-death gamble. It's not uncommon for cultivators with only thirty or forty percent odds to gamble with the heavens, ultimately succeeding through sheer luck. However, breakthroughs gained through such gambles are not without cost. The less prepared you are and the lower your chances of success, the greater the Dao injuries you incur during Foundation Establishment. These Dao injuries become deeply entrenched afterwards, and until they are removed, you cannot breakthrough to higher realms."

"The entire early stage of Foundation Establishment cultivation is, in fact, a process of healing these injuries. Conversely, if you are well-prepared, only attempting a breakthrough when you have seventy or eighty percent odds, then accordingly, the healing time required after success will be greatly reduced."

"If you possess one hundred percent odds before breaking through, then upon success, you immediately achieve perfection in the early Foundation Establishment stage and can look forward to the middle stage. In the cultivation world, this method of breakthrough is also known as 'Perfect Foundation Establishment,' generally only achievable by true disciples of True Monarchs."

This was normal. Even for Lv Yang, who had endured multiple lives of arduous cultivation to reach this point, his best-case scenario for breaking through Foundation Establishment was eighty percent, with the remaining twenty percent still unaccounted for. This wasn't a gap in talent, but purely a matter of background. After all, 'Perfect Foundation Establishment' demanded truly terrifying resources, something ordinary people simply couldn't achieve. Perhaps only the direct disciples of Golden Core True Monarchs could mobilize such immense resources.

However, despite this, Lv Yang had no intention of pursuing 'Perfect Foundation Establishment.' "While 'Perfect Foundation Establishment' sounds impressive, it merely saves cultivation time. There's no need for me to cling to it."

"Eighty percent odds are enough to take the gamble!"

"Breakthrough first, then talk!"

As the saying goes, "the higher one stands, the farther one sees." Many matters only become accessible once one becomes a Foundation Establishment True Person. The benefits of breaking through early were undeniable. Having made up his mind, Lv Yang no longer hesitated.

"By my calculations, Yu Suzhen should be close to finishing. If that old geezer, the Heaven Mending Peak Lord, was truly willing to act, she should have succeeded by now." Lv Yang formed a hand seal and once again divined Yu Suzhen's current situation.

Within the Primal Saint Sect's Connecting Heaven Cloud Sea, inside a secret realm, an ancient bronze hall stood. Yu Suzhen sat suspended in mid-air, her thin robes barely concealing the crimson flush that bloomed across her skin. On the other side, Xiao Shiye's eyes were bloodshot, his face contorted in a struggle to endure something. His bull-like physique radiated intense Yang energy, forming a stark contrast with Yu Suzhen, who was overflowing with Yin energy.

"Shameless scoundrel!" The next second, Yu Suzhen's voice turned icy. She struck the bronze coffin at the core of the secret realm, her face etched with visible fury.

Xiao Shiye was startled and terrified by her reaction. However, amidst his fear, a strange sensation quietly emerged within him, stirred by Yu Suzhen's resistance, making his self-control increasingly difficult.

The incident began with a treasure hunt in the secret realm. With his overwhelming fortune, Xiao Shiye was the first to enter the core of the secret realm, but to his surprise, Yu Suzhen was only a step behind him and forcefully snatched his opportunity. As it turned out, the legacy left by the secret realm's owner concealed a trap: after receiving the inheritance, one had to balance it with Yin and Yang energies, or immediately die from imbalance. And at that moment, only Xiao Shiye and Yu Suzhen were in the core of the secret realm. Realizing this, Xiao Shiye subconsciously stood up.

"Don't come any closer!" On the other side, Yu Suzhen cried out almost instantly, yet neither her misty eyes nor her flushed skin offered any conviction. The two drew closer, their Yin and Yang energies intertwining completely. In an instant, a fragrant aroma filled the air. Yu Suzhen's weak voice, laced with a sigh, echoed in Xiao Shiye's ears: "Little thief, if you dare touch me, I will take your life one day!"

This sentence instantly triggered Xiao Shiye's rebellious spirit. He had heard of Yu Suzhen, the renowned Fairy Suzhen, exceptionally talented, who had surpassed many disciples at a young age to break through to the late Qi Condensation stage. In comparison, he was merely an unknown nobody in the middle Qi Condensation stage. And ever since entering the secret realm, Yu Suzhen had maintained that aloof demeanor, never once putting him in her eyes, even snatching his opportunity. This was beyond endurance!

"I touched you. What can you do?" Xiao Shiye's eyes were bloodshot. In a fit of rage, he instantly abandoned the unease and self-restraint that had instinctively arisen within him.

It wasn't until several days later that Yu Suzhen awoke, yet she chose to let him go, even saving his life. From then on, an unbreakable bond formed between them. After that, Xiao Shiye could not get Yu Suzhen out of his mind. Especially when he occasionally saw that aloof fairy appear before others, he couldn't help but recall the hidden passion beneath her cold exterior. Xiao Shiye's choice was clear: he had to become stronger! Strong enough to stand before Yu Suzhen once more and openly become her Dao-companion!

Driven by this thought, Xiao Shiye arrived at the Sacred Sect's Merit Pond. He was already at rock bottom anyway; any direction was upwards. He'd gamble everything! In a place invisible to mortals, Xiao Shiye's vast fortune, which soared into the heavens, furiously burned at that moment, eliciting a response from the Merit Pond.

"I'm definitely going to win this time!"
"I've thrown all my contribution points for this year in. At least a gold, right?"
"If not gold, a purple as a minimum wouldn't be bad..."
Under the bloodshot, intensely nervous gazes of the assembled Sacred Sect disciples, the Merit Pond announced its results. Then, a seven-colored ray of light burst forth!

"Grand prize! The grand prize!" In an instant, the crowd erupted. Almost everyone's gaze immediately converged on Xiao Shiye, who was enveloped in the colorful light. Their jealousy, anger, and killing intent were almost undisguised.

*Who the hell is that?!*

Xiao Shiye paid them no mind. He simply accepted the colorful Merit Fish that landed in his hand with an excited expression, affectionately rubbing it against his palm. With this, he could turn his life around! That aloof and arrogant Fairy Suzhen would definitely look at him differently from now on! Noticing the jealous and greedy gazes around him, Xiao Shiye wasted no words. He directly swallowed the Merit Fish whole, slaughtering it on the spot, and began to consume and refine it.

The next second, all sounds ceased.

"..."

All the angry, jealous, greedy Sacred Sect disciples, including Xiao Shiye himself, stopped thinking. Time seemed to halt.

A figure, embodying all the colors of heaven and earth, quietly materialized.

It was none other than Daoist Hongyun.

"It seems the bait I cast this time yielded a good catch." Daoist Hongyun looked at Xiao Shiye, nodding with satisfaction. With the replenishment of fortune from this colorful Merit Fish, it should alleviate his pressing concerns. Thinking this, he immediately moved to reclaim Xiao Shiye and extract his fortune.

However, he quickly froze.

Because when he probed Xiao Shiye's body with his divine sense, he found Xiao Shiye's body empty, all his true qi and life force completely gone.

*He's dead.*

*Where's the fish I caught? That big one!*

Daoist Hongyun's smile froze on his face, his complexion visibly turning ashen. He stared at Xiao Shiye's corpse, a mixture of shock and fury. The next second, Daoist Hongyun performed a quick divination, then laughed furiously:

"What audacity!!!"
