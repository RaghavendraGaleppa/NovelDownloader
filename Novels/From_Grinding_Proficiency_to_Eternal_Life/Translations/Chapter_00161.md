# Chapter 161: The Bottom of Ghost Weeping Abyss

"Even a moving iron turtle is better than seventy percent of the Lingnan sects. If not for your lack of divine weapons, given time, you might have ranked among the top seven sects in the world."

As he spoke, Xiong Kun pulled a roll of rhinoceros hide from his inner robe. When unfurled, the mutton-fat jade roller gleamed with blood-red streaks in the morning light—it was a Xuanzhen Sect deed soaked in cinnabar.

"Ghost Weeping Abyss covers a radius of thirty miles, with six geothermal fire pits and three cold iron ore veins."

Xiong Kun's palm, as large as a cattail fan, pressed down on a spot on the rhinoceros hide. Beneath his fingers, the words "Tiangong" suddenly rose with golden patterns. "From today onward, this territory belongs to your Tiangong Cave."

When Hong Baichuan took the deed, the rhinoceros hide felt faintly hot to the touch.

His gaze swept over the dragon seal at the bottom of the contract, and his brow furrowed suddenly. "The official seal of the Lingnan Provincial Commissioner..."

"What use is that thing?" Xiong Kun waved his hand dismissively. That Lingnan Commissioner was utterly boring. The Xuanzhen Sect would simply inform him afterward. Could he possibly jump up and object?

"The Sect Master has sent word. The Tiangong Fortress can now be landed at Ghost Weeping Abyss."

Upon hearing the news from Mo Han, the heads of various halls, though they had long been certain of success, finally breathed a sigh of relief now that it was truly happening.

Zhan Yan exhaled, gazing at the seemingly bottomless Ghost Weeping Abyss nearby. After a long while, he finally said, "It's a pity about the Thunderfire Pool beneath Mount Guniu."

Mo Han stepped forward with a smile. "Rest assured about that. Hall Master Chu Xu of the Tiangong Hall has personally descended into the abyss. He's currently conducting surveys. There's a hidden Bronze Gate left by the Mo family here—something the Xuanzhen Sect naturally knows nothing about."

"The fact that Mo family disciples could build here indicates there's an underground forge ground no inferior to the Thunderfire Pool."

Wan Chen beside them said, "The disciples below will soon determine the coordinates. Once the Tiangong Fortress is positioned, we'll have truly settled down."

A hint of a smile appeared on Mo Han's face. "We still have much to do. There are six sects in Shu Province. As newcomers, we must pay each of them a visit."

Three hundred zhang below Ghost Weeping Abyss, the cold, rising mist on the underground river turned the tinderbox into a ghostly green.

Qi Huan hooked the hidden latch of his mechanical sword case. The fine mica case surface was covered with tiny water droplets. Every three steps, condensed water would drip down the fish-scale armor patterns, creating heart-pounding echoes in the dead silence of the abyss.

Phosphorescent moss growing in the rock crevices dyed the cave walls a ghostly blue. These fungi, which had never seen daylight for a thousand years, would burst under the soles of their boots, splashing fluorescent green sap.

Qi Huan raised his hand to signal the team to stop. He looked at the fluorescent substance staining Yan Qi's boots—that eerie green was climbing up the leather texture like living ink spreading on rice paper.

"Don't scrape it off with your blade!"

He stopped a disciple who was about to draw his dagger. A glass cover shot out from the sword case, sealing the moss inside.

"This should be the 'Ghost Skin Paint' recorded in the 'Strange Records of the Southern Wilderness.' It melts upon contact with blood and is an extremely potent poison. I thought it had been harvested to extinction by the Tang Sect, but I didn't expect there would still be some in the depths of this abyss."

As he spoke, a glowing, flocculent mass suddenly fell from the cave roof. Upon hitting the river surface, it instantly transformed into thousands of firefly-like insects, illuminating the entire underground river with a jade-green light.

By this诡异 light source, everyone saw the true appearance of the dark river. Within the dark red currents floated translucent blind fish, their spindle-shaped bodies flowing with magma-like veins.

When the Sixteen Guards' searchlight swept across the water surface, a black shadow suddenly shot up like lightning. Yan Qi's crossbow bolt was a step too slow, only pinning a three-inch-long transparent shrimp antenna.

The main body of the shrimp had already retreated to the river bottom, while the broken antenna writhed on the rock like a living snake.

"This is the 'Ground Vein Crab' mentioned in the Mo family's 'Xuanji Records.'"

"Three hundred years ago, when the Mo family set up their mechanical city here, they specifically cultivated these creatures to clean the water..." His words were interrupted by the sound of metal clashing from the other side of the dark river.

Sixteen searchlights turned in unison. The moment their beams pierced through the thick fog, everyone's breath caught.

Thirty paces away on the riverbank, half the remains of a bronze mechanical beast were being entangled by glowing vines. The beast's head, carved with Taotie patterns, had mostly rusted away, revealing crystal clusters growing between the internal gears.

What was even more chilling was the several skeletons pinned beneath the beast's claws. From their attire, they appeared to be the "Pojun Guards" of the Seventeenth Generation of the Hidden Blade Pavilion, who had gone missing eighty years ago.

Qi Huan observed for a moment, then shook his head slightly. "Probably left behind during the period when Tiangong Cave disciples were exploring Mo family mechanisms everywhere."

"Senior Brother Qi, it's the third quarter of the Xu hour."

A disciple carrying a folding crossbow kicked aside a bone half-buried in the mud. His玄 steel greaves scraped against the cave wall, sending sparks flying.

"Those bastards should be drinking celebration wine in the fortress by now, right?"

Yan Qi, the youngest of the Sixteen Guards, suddenly sneered. "You think we're still the elite of the Hidden Blade Pavilion? Haven't you seen how they've treated us these past days? When the Tiangong Fortress was excavated, aside from the Mechanism Hall, our Hidden Blade Pavilion was the first to charge forward. Wherever there was danger, we went. But has anyone ever given us a proper look?"

"It was something Hall Master Bao did..."

Yan Qi paused here,忍不住 glanced at Qi Huan's calm expression. Seeing no reaction, he continued indignantly, "Why should it implicate us disciples? If Hall Master Bao of the Mechanism Hall and the head of the Forging Hall had rebelled, then wouldn't Xu Yunfan..."

The youth deliberately swept his searchlight across everyone's chest armor. The positions that should have held the gilded tiger-head insignia now only had mottled scratches, still not repaired to this day.

Those bastards from the Forging Hall took out their anger for what Bao Yan did on them.

"Silence!"

A three-inch green light shot out from the top of Qi Huan's sword case, cutting through the mist. All complaints abruptly ceased.

But he clearly heard a muffled mutter from the back row: "...Even for exploring ground veins, we have to scramble to be the vanguard. They're just guarding against us..."

Six long swords in the sword case hummed simultaneously—it was the buzzing sound of the Hidden Blade Pavilion's secret technique, the Thousand Layer Wave Sword.

Though Qi Huan said nothing more, he was already quite displeased by their conversation.

The Sixteen Guards disciples knelt on one knee in unison. The sound of their玄 iron masks striking rock echoed far along the dark river. They dared not say another word.

Qi Huan望着岩壁上自己扭曲的倒影，突然想起一个多月前师尊被徐云帆生生打死被拖进刑堂时，那袭绣着四爪蟒纹的紫袍衣角，大周皇室暗卫的标识，像条毒蛇盘踞在他脊柱上。

Looking at his distorted reflection on the cave wall, Qi Huan suddenly recalled the scene from over a month ago: his master being beaten to death by Xu Yunfan and dragged into the punishment hall. The corner of that purple robe embroidered with four-clawed python patterns—the insignia of the Great Zhou imperial secret guards—like a venomous snake coiled around his spine.

To this day, the image remained vivid in his mind.

Whenever he recalled this matter, his temples would throb uncontrollably.

Master!

You have truly brought me great suffering!

Qi Huan sighed inwardly, suppressing the oppression in his heart, his eyes filled with gloom.

"Let's not speak of this further. After all, it was our hall master who got into trouble, and the disciples of the other halls suffered heavy casualties. It's only natural for them to take it out on us. Moreover, our Hidden Blade Pavilion disciples also suffered many losses. Give it a few more days. Once they've thought it through, they won't act like this anymore."
