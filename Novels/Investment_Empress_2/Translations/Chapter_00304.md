# Chapter 304: This Time, I Won't Run, We Play Go (1/2)

In a small county town in the Southern Frontier.

The gloomy sky resembled moldy cotton, with strong winds carrying fine snow that rustled down. The temperature in the mountains and forests was so frigid that water would freeze instantly; with weather like this, even the most experienced herb gatherers wouldn't dare go up the mountains.

Yet, a figure was moving through the dense forest as if swimming in water.

A red vine entangled in a tree was severed, and the dripping sap was collected into a bamboo tube.

"It's been unseasonably cold this year; many places will have to prepare for the sacrifices again."

Huang Donglai tilted his head back and drank some vine sap, gazing at the gray, dusty sky as he exhaled a heavy breath.

He was the only "Boy and Girl" from Wangshan City to have survived the sacrifice.

His steady and vigilant nature wasn't innate.

When he was young, his father passed away early, leaving him and his mother to live as a widow and orphan in Wangshan City. With the man of the house gone and his mother unwilling to remarry, their land was taken by the town head.

Fortunately, this place was a harsh landscape of steep mountains and treacherous waters, and there were many uncultivated wastelands in other people's fields that men were unwilling to clear.

His mother went to cultivate the corners and edges of these other people's fields. Sometimes, she got lucky and managed to harvest something before the owner came to reclaim the land. Other times, the land would be claimed by the original owner just after it was leveled, before she could even sow the seeds.

His mother never argued with anyone; she just silently went to find new wasteland to cultivate.

This cycle repeated itself.

By the time Huang Donglai was twelve, he had already become a skilled herb gatherer in the mountains, more agile than even the monkeys. He had also learned from his mother how to survive in the cracks.

Miraculously, this pair of widow and orphan survived.

He had thought that their days would continue like this forever.

But one day, the town head came to their door with a large group of people. He was terrified because his mother had just planted some sweet potatoes and had promised to bake some for him.

To his surprise, the villagers who had come to their door, angry about land issues of varying degrees, weren't fierce this time.

Everyone was beaming with smiles, bringing deer meat and new clothes, and even malt candy that was only available in big cities.

But his mother's face turned as white as snow.

That night, he ate the candy and thought that the other children in the village were all liars; the candy wasn't sweet at all.

The next morning, his mother personally dressed him in new clothes and shoes he had never worn before, making him look neat and tidy.

Under the gaze of the other town heads and priests, his mother gripped his hand tightly, so tightly it hurt, and told him he must be obedient.

Huang Donglai was panicked; he had always been obedient.

Then, he and a girl of the same age were sent up the mountain by a group of villagers. They beat gongs and drums along the way, and people kept comforting the two children, saying they were going to serve the Mountain God and live a good life, with malt candy to eat every day.

But the malt candy wasn't sweet at all.

Just as he was thinking this, the lotus seat suddenly tumbled over.

The world spun, and he fell into the woods.

In terror, he saw the person who had knocked over the lotus seat; it was a woman who had cultivated countless wastelands and was known for her great strength.

The last sound Huang Donglai ever heard from his mother was her desperate, hoarse scream:

"Run! And never come back!!"

At that moment.

With the sound of the wind whistling past his ears.

No one could ever catch him again.

"Phew..."

Huang Donglai let out a long breath, pushing aside the haze in his heart.

To be in a daze in the mountains was a very dangerous thing...

*Snap—*

Suddenly, there was a sound of a twig snapping in the distance.

Huang Donglai instantly became alert. A porcelain bottle in his palm slipped down, and at the same time, he took in the surrounding environment, instantly figuring out the best escape route. He could even leave a few simple traps along the way...

"Cough... cough..."

The coughing lasted for a long time and grew weaker and weaker.

A person?

Huang Donglai silently sensed the other party's presence and pushed aside the leaves to look.

It was a middle-aged man. His tattered clothes vaguely showed the style of a military scout. His pair of straw sandals, patched with countless knots, was in tatters, clearly showing he had undergone an unimaginable long journey.

There was a long wound on his abdomen, which was fatal. This man was on his last legs.

But upon sensing Huang Donglai, a light suddenly flashed in his eyes.

"Young brother."

"Who are you?"

Huang Donglai did not approach.

---

"Scout from Qingmu City... I don't have much time... let's make this... short..."

The man's chapped lips moved as he said hoarsely:

"The Disaster Beasts and the remnants of the Shang Dynasty in the south are making moves... Only the Prince can resolve this... The military intelligence in my hand is of utmost urgency."

"If you are willing, young brother... please deliver this letter to Qingmu City."

"If you don't want to risk it... then run... quickly... It'll be... too late..."

Huang Donglai remained silent and did not reply.

Because the man who claimed to be a scout was already dead.

He was willing to believe the man, but his instincts told him not to get involved with such a major affair.

Qingmu City would be the first to bear the brunt, destined to become the most brutal battlefield.

But after walking half a mile, the image of the man collapsing in the cold wind, the light suddenly flashing in his eyes, appeared in his mind once more. It was just like that winter many years ago, the woman who had knocked down several strong men and told him to run.

He had dreamed of that day countless times, wondering if the outcome would have been different if he hadn't run.

"Rest in peace, don't嫌 my offering is humble."

Huang Donglai turned back, took the wax-sealed envelope from the man's hand, and dug a pit to prepare a grave marker. Only then did he realize he didn't know the man's name.

He then took the man's waist token:

Lu Yi.

Huang Donglai揣着 the waist token and looked in the direction of Qingmu City, muttering to himself.

"Mom... This time, your son... won't run anymore."

......

At the same time.

In Qingmu City.

Zhong Ling looked at the crumbling battle formation and Li Mo, who was still standing in the field, feeling somewhat disheartened.

The Disaster Beast was even more difficult to deal with than she had imagined. She had been studying battle formations since she was young and was now able to command tens of thousands of soldiers and armor, with a thousand elite troops forming a formation.

Don't underestimate this number. For an ordinary person, even with a hundred people doing broadcast calisthenics, it wouldn't be easy to make them move in perfect unison.

She felt that the hundred men she had just commanded had already pushed the power of the Zhong family's battle formation to its limit.

Yet, facing Li Mo, who had transformed into the Qiongqi beast, she still felt a deep sense of powerlessness.

"Uncle Qu, were there any shortcomings in my performance just now?"

"Um..."

Qu Sheng thought for a moment, and his gaze couldn't help but drift towards a girl sitting not far away, looking calm and composed. He couldn't help but ask:

"Martial arts and battle formations have things in common. Miss Ying's attainments in martial arts were praised by the Celestial Derivation Sect as transcendent and saintly. Do you have any thoughts on this?"

"I do have some."

Ying Bing put down her teacup and raised her eyes. "If we discuss this from the perspective of martial arts, Zhong Ling's mastery of the Zhong family's battle formation has reached the stage of Minor Success."

"I saw the four concepts of Wind, Fire, Mountain, and Forest within the formation. Each concept, taken individually, is flawless, yet they do not complement each other."

"Perceptive!"

Qu Sheng's eyebrows raised slightly as he applauded. He turned to the generals beside him and said, "I told you all to study military books diligently, but in the end, your attainments are not even as good as those of two young girls."

"Complementing each other..."

Zhong Ling pondered this, understanding the principle but not knowing how to apply it. She could only look at Ying Bing in confusion.

"You will understand after we play a game of Go."

Ying Bing took out a Go board from her big-headed doll.

"Alright!"

Go and battle formations do share many similarities in their changes.

Zhong Ling sat opposite Ying Bing.

Thirty seconds later.

She was a bit curious about Ying Bing's playing style. As expected, the Cold Fairy's moves were extraordinary. The Go stones were placed in a straight line. Was there some hidden meaning behind this?

She was just about to place another stone.

"You lost."

"Eh? Didn't we just start?"

"But I already have five stones in a row."

"Huh?"
