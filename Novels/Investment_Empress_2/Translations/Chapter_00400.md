# Chapter 400: Li Mo, You Really Deserve to Die! Safety First

The dense fog over Lanke Mountain had finally dissipated.

The Go board that once carried the ominous aura of heaven and earth's spiritual malevolence had sunk deep into the ground, revealing an entrance ten zhang wide below. The abyss was so deep that even sunlight seemed unable to penetrate it.

Some people were still rushing here from outside the town.

But others had long since set up camp in front of Lanke Mountain, such as the demonic sect members of the Summoning Demon Cult, who had been waiting eagerly for a long time.

"The spiritual malevolence of Lanke Mountain has finally dissipated."

"The Upper Immortal's words were indeed true."

Tan Zhuyin stood in the sunlight, draped in a black robe.

"圣子, the things beneath Lanke Mountain, though they originate from our sect's Primordial God..."

"Is it a bit too arrogant for us to act so openly?"

The speaker was a cross-eyed man. Upon closer inspection, the markings of the Yin-Yang Hall were painted on his clothes. He was the one known as "indiscriminate of man or beast, leave neither chicken nor dog behind." He was the representative sent by the Summoning Demon Cult's Yin-Yang Hall. He said this because he had taken on a private job on the side.

But he never expected that the圣子 and the Beast Hall Master, who were always secretive and cautious in their actions, would be so ostentatious this time.

"Heh, we have the protection of my Upper Immortal brother."

Luo Yexian stood with his arms crossed, looking down on everyone else as if they were mortals.

"He told us to report to him regularly after we go in. What does that mean? It means he's telling us in advance that if anything goes wrong, he will make a move!"

"How can we reveal our movements to an outsider..."

"That's why I say you have poor eyesight and are like a frog at the bottom of a well!"

"Who says I have poor eyesight?!"

The cross-eyed man was furious. He hated it the most when others said he had poor eyesight.

"You mistook a One for an Eight yesterday, and you call that good eyesight?"

Luo Yexian's single sentence made the cross-eyed man take a deep breath, his face slightly flushed.

But who asked him to be only at the Fifth Realm, Outer Scene, and not have any family ties with the圣子?

"Hmph, with external enemies before us, are you two trying to make a spectacle of yourselves by fighting internally?"

Tan Zhuyin suddenly let out a cold snort, his tone heavy. A powerful aura suddenly rose from around him, and a fierce dragon's roar seemed to echo from behind him. He was clashing with someone in an aura battle.

The demonic cult members were stunned for a moment and looked up at the sky.

High above the heavens, a figure wearing a golden crown seemed to cover the sun, looking down with indifferent, dual-pupiled eyes. Behind him followed a group of巡天衛 clad in silver armor, all of whom had powerful auras.

"You vermin from the sewers, my defeated foe. It's one thing for you to hide in the shadows, but how dare you show your face to me?"

"Heh, what is the Great Yu Dynasty? You have no idea what kind of existence stands behind me!"

Tan Zhuyin let out a cold laugh.

Facing the Great Yu Crown Prince who had nearly taken his life once, he stood with his hands behind his back, his words filled with immense confidence.

The two factions stood in confrontation.

It couldn't be said that they were evenly matched, because every one of the巡天衛 behind Jiang Yu was an elite among the Outer Scene realm, and that bearded middle-aged man was a famously powerful figure on the Earth Ranking.

But the Summoning Demon Cult's side had a strange, inexplicable confidence, their aura not losing out in the slightest.

The two sides were at daggers drawn, as if a great battle could erupt at any moment.

The various forces and rogue martial artists who had arrived on the scene immediately stood by to watch, afraid of getting caught in the crossfire.

"The圣子 of the Summoning Demon Cult actually dares to challenge the Crown Prince殿下? Where does he get the courage?"

"Hisss... It's hard to say. The Summoning Demon Cult has a long legacy; they might have some kind of backing."

"Will they really fight?"

"I hope so. If they both suffer losses, wouldn't that give us a better chance?"

...

Not only did the forces on the scene think this way.

Even the people from the Great Yu Dynasty had turbulent thoughts, and Jiang Yu narrowed his eyes.

Why did the members of the Summoning Demon Cult look so confident?

The tension in the atmosphere was palpable.

But just at that moment, a cloud of mist suddenly drifted over from a distance.

On it were two figures, one dressed in a pure white Changshan, the other in a deep black Taiyin Liuxian skirt, like a celestial couple descended to the mortal world...

Ahem, that might not be entirely accurate.

Fairy Han was too dazzling.

---

A year older, her cold, jade-like face and figure now carried an even more mature, domineering aura. Wherever she appeared, she was the center of attention.

No one could ever imagine that Fairy Han's shattered jade lips had once uttered the word "Brother" to a certain childish guy...

"So why is she only ranked third on the Hundred Flowers List?"

"Is there a possibility that Fairy Han hasn't fully blossomed yet? Being ranked third is to give her room to grow?"

"A rigging! The envoy of the Heavenly Derivation Sect must be blind!"

If Student Li heard this, he would probably pat that person's shoulder.

To be honest, it's true.

But he probably won't have the chance, since Fairy Han's little hand is currently being held by him.

"Why is everyone just standing here?"

Li Mo was a bit confused at first, then his expression turned serious.

"Could it be that there's some dangerous existence right at the entrance to the tomb? I seem to sense a heavy feeling of crisis and killing intent."

"Mm..."

Ying Bing lowered her eyes slightly.

The killing intent didn't seem to be coming from the tomb.

Because the moment they arrived, the gazes of the entire scene turned towards the two of them.

And ultimately converged on Li Mo.

"So this is the madman who offended the殿下, and, relying on a bit of merit, doesn't know his place?"

Among the巡天衛, the bearded silver-armored commander asked in a deep voice.

Jiang Yu didn't confirm or deny it, but his dual-pupiled eyes were fixed on the two of them, his gaze thoughtful.

"It's them..."

Luo Yexian's expression was complex, his eyes filled with admiration, anger, and even a hint of fear.

"Li Mo, Ying Bing!"

Tan Zhuyin's face was dark. The hatred of seeing a sworn enemy was no less than when he saw Jiang Yu.

It was these two people who caused the death of Master Han and caused the sect's grand plan in the Southern Frontier to go up in smoke.

Moreover, the speed at which these two rose on the潜龙榜 was even more exaggerated than Jiang Yu's back in the day; they had already surpassed him, and would definitely threaten his chance of returning to the top spot in the future.

Luo Yexian said with lingering fear, "These two are probably also people blessed with great fortune... If they enter the Vast Expanse Immortal Sect..."

"You used to be from the Drizzle Pavilion?"

The Summoning Demon圣子 looked at the cross-eyed Outer Scene expert, the one known as "indiscriminate of man or beast, leave neither chicken nor dog behind."

"Yes."

"Then, after you go in, find a chance to kill them. I will reward you once it's done."

"Ah?"

The cross-eyed man was stunned.

One job, earning two portions of money? Is there such a good thing?

The gazes of both factions towards Li Mo were not friendly.

The other forces and rogue martial artists... were also quite hostile.

It was mainly directed at Li Mo.

"Li Mo, you really deserve to die!"

"He must be unable to fly, so he had no choice but to hold his hand to carry him, right?"

"It must be that!"

Facing the gazes of the many young talents, which seemed to be on the verge of shattering, Li Mo leaned back slightly, then gripped the ice cube's other hand even tighter.

"Ice Cube, you have to hold on tight to me."

"Hm?"

Li Mo said very seriously, "What if, like last time in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, we get randomly teleported to different locations? If we hold hands tightly, we won't get separated. This is for safety."

"For safety?"

Ying Bing narrowed her eyes, looking at the boy's serious expression.

She suspected that Li Mo wasn't afraid of teleportation arrays or anything like that inside the tomb.

It was that childish nature of his acting up again, deliberately using such an excuse to hold both her hands in front of so many people... It was almost like a hug.

After a moment of silence, she nodded lightly.

"......Mm, safety first."
