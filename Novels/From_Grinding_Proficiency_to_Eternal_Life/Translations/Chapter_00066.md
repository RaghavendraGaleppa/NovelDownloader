# Chapter 66: The Wild Evil God

"Monkey Bear, do you think this is your White Ape Sect?"

*Crackle!*

The red-haired man's foot suddenly shattered the blue bricks, his ten fingers actually sinking deep into the stone crevices.

This movement seemed to ignite the battle, as five figures instantly turned into afterimages.

To the east, the giant man's iron bracers on his wrists sparked, and his knotted muscles suddenly swelled by three inches, actually ramming a stone pavilion ahead into dust.

Amidst the rain of bricks and stones, the red-haired man's pores exhaled sulfur-like hot air. When his palms slammed into the ground, all the white bones within five zhang turned into red-hot iron.

"The Yin Mountain Sect's Melting Iron Palm?"

The silver-flute woman lightly tapped her toes on the eaves. Her jade flute played horizontally, actually stirring the trembling of the white bones on the ground. The formless, tangible sound wave suddenly spread out, rapidly cooling these red-hot iron pieces. An inexplicable aura spread out like tentacles, and the golden mace deeply inserted into the ground was suddenly grasped by an invisible force and pulled out.

"Treasure Artifact?!"

The red-haired man grinned wildly. "Who would have thought the people from Cangzhou's Heavenly Sound Sect would also come to join the fun."

But the black shadow assassin's chain blade was even faster than the power emitted by this treasure jade flute.

When the cold light flashed, the aura extending from the jade flute was severed, and the chain, like a venomous snake, coiled toward the golden mace.

Suddenly, a broken blade tore through the air, knocking the chain blade away. The end of the hilt was wildly flailing a chain. As the swordsman on the roof pulled, the chain went taut, and just as he was about to pull the broken blade back, the giant man's toes, like a hand, reached out, grabbed the hilt, and suddenly tightened. The chain instantly went taut like a bowstring.

"Seeking death!"

The swordsman snorted coldly. With a flick of his single hand, the chain pierced the giant man's foot like a steel awl.

Simultaneously, the red-haired man's fist, shrouded in a scorching heatwave, charged straight toward the ape-like warrior.

Then, the ink-black shadow silently approached, the chain blade drawing trails of cold light in the air, aiming straight for the red-haired man's back.

The silver-robed woman gently stroked her jade flute. The melody was melodious, yet hidden with killing intent. Her fingers plucked the jade flute, sending out sound waves like blades, striking straight at the black shadow.

The five instantly became locked in combat. Fist winds, chain blades, and sound waves intertwined. Dust flew within the courtyard, and airwaves surged. The moment one person tried to approach the large pit, they would be held back by the next, forcing them to withdraw to defend.

Xu Yunfan watched without blinking. These five were all masters of the Flesh Refining Realm.

Li Haomiao's words were not false. After the external three—sinews, bones, and skin—were unified, and one stepped into the Flesh Refining Realm, one should no longer be considered human. The martial arts cultivated would manifest obvious characteristics within the body.

Especially that ape-like warrior. His bare feet were like hands. Although he was nearly a zhang tall, his movements were incredibly agile. Allowing himself to be besieged by the red-haired man and the black-clothed man with the chain blade, this ape warrior named "Monkey Bear" moved using both hands and feet, just like an old ape moving through a forest, his agility making one's scalp tingle.

As for the palace-robed woman who looked delicate and fair, her elegant dress was now somewhat wrinkled.

Just as the five were fighting intensely, Xu Yunfan suddenly noticed something strange about the old monk.

A sound of leather tearing came from the black mist. The old monk's spine protruded section by section, and the muscles beneath his gray cloth monk's robe writhed like living things.

When the ape-like giant's foot, hard against the two men's siege, was about to touch the golden mace, a dark green hand suddenly pierced through the black mist and firmly grasped the golden mace.

It was the old monk.

The old monk, swallowed by the black mist, suddenly let out a low roar. His originally thin, bamboo-joint-like body rapidly expanded. Amidst the fierce battle of the five, the old monk's hunched figure shot up to nine feet.

The tattered monk's robe shattered into strips of cloth, revealing dark red Sanskrit characters covering his entire body. Under the surging black mist that kept seeping into his body, his muscles continuously bulged, and the runes seemed to writhe beneath his skin, like thousands of centipedes.

"Seeking death!"

The ape warrior was both shocked and furious. His large hand waved, fingers forming an eagle's claw, instantly tearing through the air, a turbid white airwave rising from his fingertips.

This strike was enough to split metal and shatter stone.

However, when the claw landed on the old monk's body, the fingers sank deep into the muscles but went no further.

This scene made the ape warrior's pupils contract violently.

The next moment, the old monk raised a leg.

The ape warrior flew backward like a rag doll, landing on the ground and rolling over fifty meters, crashing heavily into the rock beside the old pine tree where Xu Yunfan was hiding.

The immense force even cracked the rock.

In the field, the red-haired man's palms were crimson red. The moisture in his arms had been evaporated into wisps of white mist by the intense heat of his blood and Qi. His hands, capable of melting gold and turning iron to liquid, were actually劈开 by the old monk's golden mace. His entire arms were broken, blood spurting wildly.

"Ah!!!"

The red-haired man let out a miserable scream, stumbling backward. His arms shook, the broken bone fragments trembling continuously, his appearance extremely terrifying.

The old monk's arms were now bulging with veins that had turned purplish-black. The large tendons twitched, actually emitting a bowstring's twang. Blood seeped from his hands, slowly flowing into the golden mace. The light rippling from the golden mace grew increasingly intense. The sweeping gale it brought along caused the silver-robed woman nearby to bleed from her mouth and nose. Her palace dress was torn into dust by this gust of sharp wind, revealing her snow-white body.

A crack appeared on the jade flute in her hand.

"My jade flute!"

The woman's expression changed drastically. Without hesitation, she turned and fled far away.

At this moment, the black shadow assassin's chain blade bit like a viper toward the old monk's throat but was caught by the muscles three inches away.

The muscles on the old monk's neck suddenly twisted violently. The fine steel chain blade shattered into iron filings. The black-clothed man was also thrown by this vibrating force, his sleeves bursting apart, and his entire body staggered, crashing into the ruins of the Buddhist hall.

It seemed like a light fall, but it actually kicked up a sky full of dust.

The western wall suddenly erupted with a rumble. The one-armed swordsman swung his broken blade through the air, like a silver-white bolt of cloth, but the golden mace casually pierced his chest.

When the last person fell, steam rose all around the old monk. The Sanskrit on his back had converged into the form of an eight-armed Bodhisattva, but it seemed he could not withstand the power. Propped on the golden mace, he knelt on the ground, motionless.

What the hell?!

Xu Yunfan's mind shook.

Five experts had attacked, yet they were beaten without any power to fight back by the old monk wielding the golden mace.

This was at least the terrifying power of the Blood Transformation Realm. This divine weapon was truly terrifying. With a casual swing, it could unleash a fierce airwave, bringing about a gale that tore through everything.

Time to run.

Xu Yunfan immediately abandoned the hopeful thoughts that had involuntarily risen in his heart. Just as he was about to move and prepare to leave, the ape warrior below, with blood at the corner of his mouth and weakened aura, suddenly spoke.

"Young man, that old monk only has temporary courage. Now that an evil god has possessed him, he seeks to use a body to be reborn. His life force is completely dried up. This is the perfect moment. Go up and kill this old monk. I, Liu Xiong of the White Ape Sect, will owe you a debt of gratitude."

It seemed these people had discovered him long ago.

Xu Yunfan's mouth twitched. He paid no attention and quickly moved far away, disappearing into the night.

Watching Xu Yunfan leave without hesitation, Liu Xiong sighed, supporting himself with his hand on the ground to get up.

He had just moved when his body stiffened, and he dared not move again.

That kick earlier had shattered his chest bones and displaced his internal organs. If he wanted to live, he could only lie still, silently adjusting his blood and Qi, and蠕动 his muscles to slowly reset the broken bones and displaced organs.
