# Chapter 241: The Battle on the Plateau Concludes

The two old men were frail, looking as if a gust of wind could sweep them away. They lacked the otherworldly aura of Immortal Path experts, appearing skeletal and utterly withered.

Qin Ming’s emotions surged, a mix of gratitude and profound moving. He said, “Seniors, how can I help you?”

What the two had done for him, they sought no reward, for they had not many years left to live; their lifespans were nearing their end.

Yu Gensheng said, “Child, we are at this age, we need nothing. Our only regret is that the New Life Path grows ever dimmer. The condition of the several Grandmasters... is likely very grim.”

Zhao Ziyuan sighed softly, “Other paths are blooming with a hundred flowers, producing talents in droves. Alas, our path suffers from a lack of fresh blood, and its situation is precarious. If the Grandmasters were to suddenly pass away, the consequences would be unimaginable. We urgently need someone to take up the banner, to extend the life of this path, and we see a glimmer of hope in you.”

Qin Ming nodded solemnly. All he could do was cultivate diligently and rise as soon as possible!

At the same time, he strongly wished to extend their lives. “Seniors, I have the ‘Fate Altering Scripture’, and I also obtained half of the ‘World-Dwelling Scripture’ from the Cui family.”

“We’ve tried every method we could think of. The main issue is our advanced age; we can no longer advance on the New Life Path. Our cultivation realms are stuck.”

The two shook their heads, thanking him for his kind intentions, but said he didn’t need to do anything extra.

“Auspicious Beast blood, it must be useful,” Qin Ming insisted.

At this moment, his fighting spirit burned intensely. He couldn’t delay any longer. He had to seize this final opportunity to push forward, outcompete all rivals, and strive to obtain two more portions of Auspicious Blood.

“You don’t need to risk yourself for us. We are two decaying individuals; we’ve long accepted our fate. Besides, Auspicious Beast blood can only extend life for a period; it can’t solve the fundamental problem.”

“Even if it’s just for a while, it’s good!” Qin Ming said.

As they spoke, he and the two old men quickly cleared the battlefield. Some memory crystals could be kept, while others “had to be” destroyed during the battle.

“All former familiar faces,” Qin Ming murmured to himself, looking at the bloodstains covering the ground.

Yu Gensheng sternly lectured him, “Child, you are too sentimental. For people like these, there’s no need for any pity; just kill them!”

Qin Ming smiled and shook his head, “Those I personally killed who were once familiar, I call ‘familiar kin’ for short.”

The two were speechless.

Zhao Ziyuan asked, “Child, your ability to kill someone in the Third Realm truly shocked us. How did you do it?”

When they first heard the news, they both found it unbelievable, like something out of a fairy tale.

Qin Ming didn’t hide it, telling them that he had obtained the Essence of Starlight.

Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan gasped in the night mist. This was truly astonishing; it was a “heavenly material” that even some old seniors only dreamed of, the most supreme treasure from beyond the world.

Qin Ming frankly admitted that he might not necessarily refine it, as he had his own considerations for his future path and was still weighing his options, or perhaps there was an even better plan. After all, simply by practicing remarkable cultivation arts, he had already elevated his own Sky-Light to Four Imperial Strengths!

“Internal cultivation?!”

After the two learned of his true situation, their minds trembled. This child was far more remarkable than they had imagined.

“In less than ten months, or even just seven or eight months, you’ve stepped into the Second Realm. This is true Outer Sage, not merely outer manifestation!”

“If someone like this still cannot forge a path for the Newcomers, then likely no one ever will, and this path should simply cease to exist!” They made such an evaluation.

At the same time, both felt that they shouldn’t stick to old conventions; they should “feed” him what he needed. Such a youth could not possibly be wasted.

Yu Gensheng asked, “Child, how you walk your path is up to you. Do you have any particular scriptures you need right now?”

Qin Ming immediately said, “The ‘Wither-Bloom Scripture’. In the domain of Outer Sage, I will incorporate it, and I’ve already obtained half of it.”

“Good!” The two nodded, preparing to find a way to resolve this.

“Is there anything else you need?” they asked again.

For Qin Ming, the more remarkable cultivation arts, the better.

He asked, “What scriptures are you two seniors skilled in?”

“The scripture we’ve invested the most effort into is the ‘Geomagnetic Scripture’. Above it, there’s also a subsequent secret classic.”

Hearing this, Qin Ming’s eyes blazed with fervor. This was a domain he had never touched before; such a remarkable cultivation art should provide a significant boost to him.

When the two learned how many remarkable cultivation arts he actually mastered, their scalps tingled a bit. It was truly too many; would something go wrong?

The two were somewhat worried. One remarkable cultivation art was enough for a Newcomer to study for a lifetime; a genius could practice more, but he had already mastered nearly ten.

“This child’s growth speed far exceeds what either of us imagined!”

“We will only provide convenience; we shouldn’t casually give advice.”

***

Outside the Third Forbidden Zone, on this vast plateau, the demonic beasts were in full retreat. Even the Ancestral Auspicious Beasts had been slain; the outcome was long determined.

Qin Ming was on a killing spree, more driven than anyone. He was accumulating rare “blood medicine” for his Outer Sage path, and even more so, fighting for life-saving items for the two old men.

Jin Xiang, who had re-established contact, galloped along, pulling an armored cart behind Qin Ming. The golden goat was dumbfounded; this junior brother was truly defying the heavens.

His efficiency in slaying demons was too high, and they were all tough opponents. What should have been hard-fought battles were simply swept aside by him!

Qin Ming was now completely in a desperate, fighting-to-the-death stance!

“No one to support my lofty ambitions...” A particularly monstrous demon wailed sorrowfully. It had killed one human cultivator after another, actually slaughtering its besiegers.

It had had a chance to become a “Demonic Seed,” but for various reasons, it was ultimately eliminated, only narrowly losing to its opponent. However, its treatment was completely different. The Demonic Seeds on the plateau had already been transported away in advance, but it had been intercepted.

At its feet, corpses lay everywhere. It had killed so many people that eventually, no one dared to approach that area.

“No one to support your lofty ambitions? I’ll send you to the Western Heavens!” Qin Ming arrived, killing intent blazing. For the last stretch, he flew on his blade, a five-colored halo protecting him. His dazzling blade-light dispersed the night mist, making him appear like a young deity descending from the sky.

“‘Demonic Seed Gatekeeper’? Equivalent to Li Qingxu’s level on the Immortal Path.” Qin Ming made the judgment immediately.

***

At this moment, the Li family members were all smiles, each one radiant.

A piece of news was circulating on the plateau: The Cui family had lost several teams! Furthermore, a small group of their family’s experts, responsible for intelligence gathering and personnel deployment, had actually been wiped out entirely.

All of Cui family’s allies were dumbfounded. How was this done? Other families were reaping full harvests, while the Cui family was losing people.

The Li family confirmed that their rivals had suffered considerable losses.

“Good thing we were cautious and passed this news to the Cui family, letting them test the waters. Heh heh, who knew thunder would strike on flat ground? The Cui family hit a steel plate!”

The Li family members couldn't help but burst into laughter. Now they were outsiders, enjoying the show.

Soon, they received a secret report: The earliest source of the news was actually the Cui family.

“The Cui family originally intended to use us? How malicious!” Some Li family members’ expressions changed.

They were originally about to set out, but an elder, being more cautious and conservative, temporarily changed his mind and sent this “great gift” to the Cui family. They had almost stepped on a landmine. Fortunately, they ultimately kicked the problem back to its origin.

At this moment, the Cui family experts on the plateau were furious, especially after they “cross-referenced information” and learned they had been set up by the Li family. All their faces turned ashen. Subsequently, the atmosphere between the two sides grew tense.

The two great families had long-standing grievances; even a small spark could ignite the night sky.

Not long after, the Cui family and the Li family engaged in multiple conflicts, fighting across various locations on the plateau, a true “two-way street” to confrontation. Of course, while slaying demons and earning battle merits, they couldn't fully engage in a large-scale fight; only some areas saw slightly serious bloodshed.

It was also at this time that some people learned the name Qin Ming.

“Reportedly, the New Life Path produced an incredible genius?”

When some first heard the news, the details about the youth still felt somewhat vague. But some acquaintances were stunned and deeply shocked.

“Qin Ming, is that the one we know?!” Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan were astonished.

Just a few months ago, Qin Ming didn't even qualify to be their golden-armored guard. Now he’s suddenly risen? They found it hard to believe.

“My best brother, he’s here too, and he’s about to shine and make a name for himself?!” Ning Siqi was greatly surprised, then worried.

His cousin, Wang Caiwei, was lost in thought.

Lu Zhenyi, Chen Bingyan, and others wondered if it was an outsider with the same name.

“Brother Ming, is this going to expose you?” Little Wu frowned.

The rumors were still rather hazy, with no explosive news spreading widely.

Cui Chonghe sneered; that was just his body double! At this moment, he had not yet received the latest and confirmed news.

***

Qin Ming’s five-colored blade dripped with blood. That incredibly powerful demonic beast lay dead, its lofty ambitions severed by him. Afterwards, he relentlessly pursued the scattered demonic beasts across the plateau, becoming a young killing star in this area, and in many people’s eyes, the most relentless competitor.

Finally, throughout the entire plateau, the sounds of battle grew weaker and weaker until they were inaudible. The great war was drawing to a close; in fact, many areas had already concluded.

“Alright, all parties are to withdraw in an orderly fashion. Our own people must not engage in conflict. Anyone who dares to stir up trouble or cause internal strife during the retreat will be severely punished by the Grandmasters!”

In the night sky, a powerful expert transmitted a strict warning. This was because such a tendency had already emerged, with some major powers, like the Cui family and the Li family, already having friction.

“There’s no need to return to Kunling City. Battle merits can be tallied outside the plateau. Fairness and impartiality will be guaranteed, and anyone who disagrees can raise their objections publicly!”

Under the cover of night, all parties showed joy upon hearing this, especially some rogue cultivators who cheered with excitement. Even if there was no Auspicious Beast blood to be had, there were still other benefits to be gained based on the demonic beast heads slain. Otherwise, why would they be so active?

Whenever there was a grand reclamation, a large amount of resources would be distributed. Outside the Third Forbidden Zone, this plateau contained numerous secret realms and many great demon lairs, which had already been cleared by the high-level cultivators and could now be distributed downwards as various benefits.

“Holy crap, that masked person named Li Bai has an incredibly dazzling battle record! He can definitely exchange it for Auspicious Beast blood, that’s amazing!”

“Hiss, did you see that? A certain Immortal Seed from the Outer Realm, his white robes are stained red with blood, and his ethereal aura has transformed into a killing god’s presence! Looking at his gains, he can certainly exchange for two portions of Auspicious Beast blood!”

As the teams that swept the plateau returned, exclamations constantly arose from the crowd.

Soon, people saw a golden goat, sturdier than an ox or horse, pulling a cart full of demonic beast heads. Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions almost turned to stone.

“Jin Xiang, you’re refining your mind in the mortal world; could it be that you’ve already achieved great mastery? How could you have such outrageous gains, or are you serving a powerful team?”

Jin Xiang thought to himself: *The battle results are far more than just this.*
