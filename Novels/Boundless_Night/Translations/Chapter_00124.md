## Chapter 124: Where the Lights are Dimming

Outside the Luofu Mountain ruins, there were a great many people. In recent times, the competition among Outland disciples for quasi-immortal artifacts was arguably one of the hottest topics.

The prominent figure from the Outland Pure Land spoke, "Today, I've seen many familiar faces, and even old friends whom I haven't met in one hundred and twenty years have arrived. What a rare treat. Let us enter Luofu Immortal Town to reminisce."

Many were startled. One hundred and twenty years unseen, truly an "old friend," suggesting their status was equally high. Instantly, the atmosphere here grew even more fervent.

Blessed Lands, millennium-old noble families, imperial dynasties, secret sects, high-grade variant beings... All had representatives arrive, and their statuses were quite high, making for a grand occasion.

In Luofu Immortal Town, a true Four-Tusked White Elephant appeared. Its background was immense, and it had already transformed into human form, appearing as a youth, accompanied by an old elephant whose teeth had all fallen out.

A prince from the Great Yu Dynasty arrived, chatting and laughing freely with Cui Chonghe, their conversation quite congenial. He was about to join an Outland sect.

Qin Ming noticed that a mere competition among Outland disciples had attracted numerous people of extraordinary status, evolving into a grand gathering where many were expanding their connections.

Soon, he saw Fifth Master Cui from the Cui family and very much wanted to go ask if his grandfather had truly gone to the Great Yu Imperial Capital. Qin Ming knew those were likely lies; back when he was at the Cui family, Second Master Cui, Fifth Master Cui, and others had fabricated those words simply to induce him to practice the silk scrolls.

He restrained himself, no longer looking in that direction. Given his current status, he had no right to approach the high-ranking members of a millennium-old noble family.

Luofu Immortal Town, a relatively quiet ancient town, was exceptionally lively today. Blessed Lands and millennium-old noble families had made arrangements long ago, even having a grand banquet prepared.

Undoubtedly, the most dazzling person currently was Li Qingyue. Although many esteemed guests had arrived, including venerable seniors and exceptionally talented prodigies, many gazes converged upon her.

Li Qingyue was surrounded at the center, a scene that could be described as a galaxy of stars. Many of the young people there were direct descendants of Blessed Lands, imperial dynasties, and secret sects, and also future high-ranking figures.

Senior Brother Pei was handsome and refined, as well as quite mature and steady. As a young paragon in his twenties from a Blessed Land, he knew many people and introduced them to Li Qingyue one by one. These individuals, having been nurtured by their families since childhood, were relatively mature even in their teens, possessing precocious mentalities. There were no major incidents or surprises; they were all eagerly and amicably getting acquainted and conversing.

After shedding his armor, the youth Lu Zhen from Yin-Yang Temple changed into his black and white robes and was also invited over by some, qualifying to join the group. This was because the Yin-Yang Black-White Art he cultivated was renowned throughout the world, making peers from the Outland Pure Land and secret sects extremely wary of him at this stage. Most importantly, Yin-Yang Temple was a very powerful dao lineage, and Lu Zhen was a core disciple there.

Qin Ming glanced at Li Qingyue amidst the brilliant lights, knowing that her rise was unstoppable, clear from everyone's attitude towards her. With a quasi-immortal artifact in hand, coupled with her dazzling performance this time, the Outland Pure Land would likely regard her as one of their most important prodigies.

"I wish you smooth sailing and that all your wishes come true," Qin Ming murmured.

Then, he turned his head to look at Meng Xinghai and said, "Uncle, we should go."

"Aren't you going to say hello before leaving?"

"No, it's not appropriate for the occasion," Qin Ming shook his head. Over there, where she was the center of attention, though they were mostly young men and women, they all had significant backgrounds. It would be inappropriate for him to approach as a golden-armored guard. If he truly walked over, he would inevitably draw many gazes, possibly posing a risk. He needed to leave discreetly now.

Meng Xinghai was very pleased, nodding with a smile, "Not getting carried away, very good!"

Qin Ming immediately realized that the few words Old Meng had said to him tonight were tests, stemming from a worry that he might feel a psychological disparity and wasn't mature enough.

"Uncle, you really are..." Qin Ming found it inappropriate to call him "Uncle Meng" here, fearing it might reveal his identity.

Meng Xinghai said, "The future path is still long. What are these small glories in front of us? What's wrong with walking the path of physical mutation? Who says your future prospects are fixed, that you can only be a guard for Outlanders or a follower for secret sect members? The true path lies beneath your own feet. If you can keep advancing rapidly, ascend to become a young Grandmaster, become a young Ancestral Path-Opener, wouldn't that be far more brilliant than those so-called prodigies, suppressing them until they can't breathe?" Of course, he only transmitted these words secretly; otherwise, even someone as strong as him might "suffer an incident" on the spot.

Qin Ming said, "Uncle, you truly are constantly spurring me on. Since you like the path of mutation so much, why don't you stop thinking about becoming a god, turn around, and walk with me?"

Meng Xinghai immediately waved his hand, saying, "Stop, I can't do it. I've been battered and bruised on this path; I really can't go on. Look at the people of my generation, those once peerless figures, they've all disappeared—either they changed their path, or they fell into the Outland, or they became Outer Protectors of secret sects. It chills my heart to see."

Qin Ming continued to egg him on, saying, "How great would it be if we, uncle and nephew, traveled together, walking this path side-by-side—one becoming a young Grandmaster, and the other a middle-aged Grandmaster!"

Meng Xinghai didn't smile; instead, he was very serious. "In the past five years, I haven't moved an inch on this path. My heart is cold and disheartened. Even with my formidable talent, it's not enough; one can imagine the fate of others of my generation. Fortunately, I've done well within the secret sect, hoping that someday there might be a slim chance to ascend the peak and approach that terrifying unknown being."

Qin Ming knew that the path of the secret sects was far crazier than that of the Outland. First, one approached "god-like beings," and then embarked on a journey of great blasphemy!

"Uncle, let's go!" Qin Ming left first. He wanted to return to Redmist City, to rise steadily in that remote place. Although the lights before him were brilliant, they were actually quite distant from him. Blessed Lands, millennium-old noble families, imperial dynasties, secret sects, Outland Pure Land—these were all colossal entities he could not approach. For now, it was too dangerous.

Meng Xinghai nodded, "Mm, it's time to go back. The grand examinations in various regions are entering a critical phase. Do you want to spar with the top scorers from other cities? There should be generous rewards."

The two departed, without any hesitation.

Li Qingyue sensed something, suddenly turned her head, and found the familiar figure already at the fading lights, then swiftly disappearing into the night.

---

Luofu City was magnificent, its brilliance unhidden by the night mist. At this moment, the entire colossal city was beneath Qin Ming and Meng Xinghai's feet as they stood on the back of a high-grade flying mount, rapidly departing with the night wind. The golden high-grade exotic bird wore a secret-gold helmet on its head and rare-metal armor on its body, completely covered, resembling a large, winged tortoise.

Soon, Luofu City behind them completely vanished. The path ahead was dark, the night mist thick. The entire world seemed steeped in ink. Qin Ming had spent several days in the radiant Fire Spring area, where he felt no darkness. Now, returning to this familiar yet real world, his expression was somewhat dazed. Fortunately, he adapted quickly.

"Don't take the original path..." Meng Xinghai secretly transmitted a message to the high-grade variant creature, guiding it towards an unknown location.

"Uncle Meng, are we not going back directly because you're worried someone might be following us?" Qin Ming asked.

"From what I can sense, there shouldn't be any issues, but to be safe, we'll take a slight detour to visit my grand-uncle master and ask him to help us with some purification," Meng Xinghai secretly transmitted. He was extremely cautious; if there were any anomalies that even he hadn't detected, it would indicate a very serious problem.

The high-grade variant creature was incredibly powerful and flew extremely fast, traversing the night mist like a streak of light speeding away. It wasn't long before it had flown eight hundred li, nearing its destination. Along the way, Meng Xinghai pointed the way, indicating the precise location.

After flying for several more dozens of li, it began to slow down, passing a dimly lit small town. It gradually descended, finally landing ten li outside the town.

"Grand-uncle Master, I specifically came to visit you!" Meng Xinghai called out.

This was a towering cliff, immensely vast, as if a once cloud-piercing mountain had been cut in half, leaving only a wide platform. Even in the dead of night, an old man was still fishing at the edge of the cliff. Without turning his head, he said, "Oh, please. When have you ever specifically visited me? You must have something you need again."

Meng Xinghai laughed, "Wasn't I afraid of disturbing your journey to godhood? I dared not come on normal days. Today, passing by, I happened to buy you two jars of good wine."

Qin Ming's gaze was strange. This was the fine wine from the Luofu Immortal Town banquet; he hadn't seen Meng Xinghai sneak anything away when they left.

"Don't mention 'godhood' to me; I'm going to vomit. I can't even become a mountain god. I've been fishing for a hundred years, and it still won't bite!" The old man seemed a bit annoyed.

He then reeled in his fishing rod and stood up, walking over. The old man was tall, easily two meters, brimming with vitality, his complexion ruddy, though not much hair remained.

"Greetings, Senior," Qin Ming bowed to him, simultaneously quite curious: what did becoming a god have to do with fishing here? He looked down towards the base of the severed mountain.

"Don't look; it's easy for something bad to happen. The things below are terrifying. This is a special place," the old man warned. He had a good temper and no senior's airs.

Meng Xinghai told Qin Ming that below was an endless abyss, shrouded in thick mist, mysterious and unfathomable. It was best not to pry.

"Hmm, you've indeed brought trouble to my doorstep again. Interesting. Some old fellow placed a simple mark on this youth," the old man said, pointing at Qin Ming. Then he asked, "Is this child very special?"

"This..." Meng Xinghai was startled and quickly recounted Qin Ming's experiences on this trip. Qin Ming himself added, wondering if he had actually fallen into the sight of some major figure.

"I understand now. You impersonated a Six Sovereigns disciple. That old fellow was once slapped by 'Six Sovereigns' when he was young. Now he probably heard that 'Six Sovereigns' is dying, and unsure of the truth, he wants to probe the reality through you. This isn't a big deal, nothing serious."

After the old man finished speaking, his eyes glowed, causing a faint light to rise from Qin Ming's body, then burn away and vanish without a trace.

"Grand-uncle Master, what do you think about this child walking the path of the secret sects?" Meng Xinghai asked.

"Do you think just anyone can possess 'Divine Wisdom' and be suitable for this path? Hmm, wait a moment!" Suddenly, the old man's expression subtly changed. Divine light flowed in his eyes, transforming into symbols as he stared at Qin Ming. "Hiss, what a good seed! Excellent, such rich Divine Wisdom!" he exclaimed in admiration.

"I knew he had it, but is his Divine Wisdom *that* abundant?" Meng Xinghai's emotions were complex. He felt relieved that Qin Ming had a new path, yet also a little wistful. Was there truly no one who could consistently walk the path of the newly born all the way to the end?

"Take this scripture and let him try cultivating it. Come back in half a year. I'm currently locked in a fierce battle with this abyss, and I don't have the energy to be distracted," the old man said straightforwardly, directly stuffing a very thin booklet into Meng Xinghai's hand, then began to shoo them away.

In fact, Qin Ming had already silently memorized the opening incantations while on the severed mountain, and then began to try practicing them after they set off.

When the high-grade exotic bird descended upon Redmist City, he told Meng Xinghai, "Uncle Meng, I cultivated a sacred light, but..."

"What's wrong?" Meng Xinghai quickly asked. To cultivate it so quickly, his talent was truly a bit *too* good. At the same time, he also heard that something seemed to have gone wrong, making him a little nervous. The path to godhood was not to be trifled with; it required serious treatment.

"The sacred light was... melted away," Qin Ming informed him. He had encountered this situation again!

Meng Xinghai immediately checked him, finding no issues at all. "We'll talk about it back home."

For the next two days, Qin Ming continued to practice the method from that thin booklet. The result was that whenever sacred light appeared, it would be melted away, nourishing his physical body, slowly enhancing his physique, leaving only a small amount of sacred light to maintain a certain balance.

On the third day, Meng Xinghai came to call Qin Ming, saying, "Mm, stop practicing this one for now. Someone has sent you an invaluable secret tome; they've delivered the first three pages. Go quickly and see if you can cultivate it. If not, we'll need to find you a normal miraculous art."

"What secret tome? Who sent it?" Qin Ming asked.

"Who once said they'd send you a cultivation method?" Meng Xinghai asked with a smile.
