# Chapter 65: The Hunt

"This winter is colder than previous years."

In the mountain forest, amidst the snow-covered ground, every step left deep footprints as they carried heavy weapons to conserve energy. Only Maori, who had come along, moved with remarkable lightness.

How could they hunt the red python without Maori?

Moreover, if not for their formidable martial cultivation that fortified their vitality, ordinary martial artists attempting to enter the mountains in such severe cold would be courting death.

Zhang Jingxiu was the eldest among them and, unlike Fusong—who had spent nearly his entire life in the mountains—his knowledge of the martial world came mostly from Fushan or the patients who visited Qingfu Palace. Zhang Jingxiu was different. In his youth, he had roamed the martial world, earning a fearsome reputation with his rich experiences and broad knowledge. Only in his later years did his appearance grow more benevolent.

The Western Mountains spanned several provinces, including part of Xijiang Province. For the first time in many years, he felt the mountain cold bite so deeply. He couldn't shake the feeling that the world was becoming increasingly abnormal.

Zhou Qing shared his sentiment, recalling a passage that came to mind:

*"The cold wind is like a blade, using the earth as a chopping board, treating all living things as fish and meat. The endless flying snow turns the heavens into a furnace, melting all things into silver."*

The path of seeking the Dao was no different from the martial path—cold, harsh, and fraught with life-and-death struggles. Only the adversaries were not always human.

Cultivation required tranquility and nurturing the true self, but when action was needed, it had to be swift and thunderous.

As night slowly fell, the three grew increasingly solemn. They had already ventured dozens of miles into the mountains, relying solely on Zhou Qing's exceptional memory to determine their approximate location and distance from the red python's trail.

In the winter mountains, everything they encountered was terrifying—whether living creatures or spectral entities. Nightfall only heightened the danger. This time, there was no wooden hut to shelter them from the snowstorm.

Zhou Qing's vision was the sharpest. After mastering the Deer's Cry Thunder Resonance, his liver's enhancement had elevated his sight to a new level. Still, his clarity at night was far inferior to daylight. Moreover, some fierce beasts and birds of prey didn't rely solely on sight to perceive their surroundings. Having lived for years in these perilous mountains, they knew better how to conceal themselves and detect prey.

But Zhou Qing and his companions, as prey, were no less terrifying as hunters.

Before night fully descended, Zhou Qing found a cave.

"A tiger's den?"

The three immediately grew wary, scanning their surroundings. Finding no immediate threats, they lit a fire inside the cave.

They discovered signs of a struggle. Zhou Qing deduced it was likely the red python battling a tiger. Dried bloodstains on the ground indicated the fight had occurred some time ago.

"What a clash of titans," Fusong remarked with a cold chuckle.

Zhou Qing felt a pang of worry. Judging by the scene, the tiger had likely perished. Devouring such a beast might have strengthened the python's power. However, digesting an entire tiger would take the python considerable time.

They needed to find it quickly.

A sense of urgency gnawed at Zhou Qing. The longer they waited, the more the python would absorb the tiger's essence, regaining mobility. The bitter cold might hinder the python, but the nourishment from its meal would outweigh the weather's effect.

Taking turns keeping watch, with Maori guarding the cave entrance, they rested to regain their strength. The next day, Zhou Qing finally pinpointed the python's location and tracked it to its lair on a nearby peak.

Fresh trails led to the python's cave. Rather than approach directly and risk alerting it, Zhou Qing surveyed from an adjacent peak. The snow had cleared, and with no mist obstructing his view, he spotted the python's den—and even caught a glimpse of the serpent itself.

"Now that we've located it, we can plan," Fusong said as they regrouped.

Conventional hunting tools would be useless against the python, only adding unnecessary weight. Their true weapons were their martial prowess, blades, and the sedative Zhou Qing had applied to his arrows—hoping it would prove effective.

"Today, I'll hunt a leopard or some other prey. We'll feast and prepare for tomorrow's assault."

The dried meat and vitality-restoring pills they had brought were enough to sustain them but insufficient for the demands of a fierce battle.

Zhou Qing set out alone with his bow, arrows untipped with sedatives—this hunt was for sustenance, not subterfuge. He had no intention of consuming tainted meat.

With skills learned from hunters, his keen senses, and an innate connection to the wild, he moved like a tiger returning to its domain—free, unrestrained, and deadly.

The battle raged fiercely. The python's tail glowed crimson, infused with a terrifying, mysterious power. Zhang Jingxiu, unleashing his full strength with a secret technique, clashed with the beast. The impact sent shockwaves through the air, scattering snow and shaking the earth.

Zhou Qing realized then that his senior, the Mad Daoist, had suppressed the python's power during their confrontation. The python hadn't exhibited this crimson aura then—either the Mad Daoist had restrained it, or the python hadn't unleashed its full might. The mysteries of the Xiantian realm were profound.

The python's crimson power was likely its demonic energy—proof it had evolved into a true demonic beast. Yet the sedative on Zhou Qing's arrows was taking effect.

Zhang Jingxiu disengaged, retreating to avoid being ensnared. Seizing the moment, Maori retrieved two arrows, which Zhou Qing swiftly fired. They struck the python's head but failed to penetrate deeply, only enraging it further. The arrows protruded like horns, lending the beast a fearsome, draconic visage.

The python turned its fury on Zhou Qing, who retreated while pelting it with iron pellets. Fusong and Zhang Jingxiu flanked it—one wielding a spear like a dragon, the other a crescent blade like a soaring azure serpent.

Cornered, the python lashed out at Fusong, its tail shattering his spear and splitting his palms. Zhang Jingxiu's blade bit deep into its scales, but the python retaliated, its tail striking with crushing force. Using a supple palm technique, Zhang Jingxiu redirected the blow, rolling away just in time.

Fusong, ignoring his injuries, channeled his qi into a dragon's roar and drove his spear into the python's maw. The weapon shattered, and the recoil bloodied his hands. The python's tail slammed into his leg, eliciting a cry of pain.

In that instant, Zhou Qing discarded his bow and seized his halberd. His movements were a blur, his footwork flawless, accompanied by the resonant cry of a tiger—as if the spirit of the devoured beast still lingered, lending him its fury.

The python, weakened by the sedative and injuries from spear and blade, faltered. Zhou Qing pressed the attack, weaving illusions with his footwork while Fusong and Zhang Jingxiu harried it. Maori darted in, aiming for the python's eyes—its most vulnerable spot.

Clad in fire-resistant armor, Zhou Qing withstood two direct hits from the python's tail, his robust vitality keeping him standing. Gradually, the python's life force waned. Blood stained the snow as the battle's ferocity ebbed.

Finally, under Zhou Qing's relentless assault, the python succumbed. Maori pecked out its eyes, and Zhou Qing drove his halberd into its vitals, ending the struggle.

Exhausted, the three rested while Maori fed on scraps. Zhou Qing tended to their wounds with medicine and acupuncture, ensuring no lasting damage. The value of the "Spring Return Scripture" shone here—its techniques were tailored to heal martial injuries.

Afterward, Zhou Qing dissected the python. Within its belly, he found a pigeon-egg-sized object—red, round, and pulsing with warmth. Not a gallbladder, but likely an inner elixir. Wary of a potential demonic spirit like the ghost fox's, he remained vigilant. But even if one emerged, his Tiger's Roar Soul Suppression technique would handle it easily.

Then, his bloodied hands pulled something else from the carcass—a hide. Familiar. He already possessed two.

This was the third.

Zhang Jingxiu, like a raging elephant, unleashed his full power. Zhou Qing recognized the technique—"Serpent Spits Elixir," a secret method to amplify vitality, used now against the serpent itself.

With a resonant ring, Zhang Jingxiu's crescent blade arced through the air like an ascending dragon. The python's tail, now crimson with demonic energy, met the strike. The collision was cataclysmic, shaking the earth and scattering snow.

Zhou Qing understood then how the Mad Daoist had subdued the python—through superior technique, suppressing its demonic power. The mysteries of the Xiantian realm were profound indeed.

The python was no mere beast but a demonic entity. Yet the sedative was working. Zhang Jingxiu, reeling from the impact, retreated to avoid entanglement.

Maori retrieved two more arrows. Zhou Qing fired them, striking the python's head but failing to pierce deeply. Enraged, the beast turned on Zhou Qing, who fell back, harassing it with iron pellets while Fusong and Zhang Jingxiu attacked from the sides.

The python, slower now, panicked and targeted Fusong. Its tail shattered his spear and wounded him, but Zhang Jingxiu's blade bit deep into its flesh. The python writhed in agony, its tail striking Zhang Jingxiu, who deflected the blow with a fluid palm technique.

Fusong, ignoring his injuries, stabbed his spear into the python's maw, shattering it. The python's tail smashed into his leg, eliciting a cry. In that moment, Zhou Qing seized his halberd and struck with tiger-like ferocity, the spirit of the devoured beast echoing in his movements.

The python, weakened by sedatives and injuries, faltered. Zhou Qing pressed the attack, his footwork flawless, while Fusong and Zhang Jingxiu harried it. Maori targeted its eyes, and Zhou Qing's armor withstood its blows.

Finally, the python fell. Zhou Qing extracted its inner elixir and a third hide—another piece of the puzzle. The hunt was over.
