# Chapter 271: Ice and Snow Melt Away

Even Xu Yunfan's passable facial features now seemed astonishingly handsome upon closer inspection.

This was a prodigy!

Since he had already spoken, Bi Sheng ignored the suspicious look from Lin Qingxuan beside him and spoke directly. "What's so special about the Tiangong Cave? Aside from wasting your talent, it's utterly useless. With your comprehension and aptitude, forging weapons is a complete waste. Come practice martial arts and cultivation with me!"

Bi Sheng's eyes shone brightly as he stared intently at Xu Yunfan.

"Do you know of the Dao Sect's 'Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock'?"

Bi Sheng's eyes suddenly flashed with a purple-green light. His white hair stirred without wind beneath his Daoist crown, and even his fingertips seemed to glow.

"This martial art is a secret transmission of the Dao Sect. It can directly lead to the Nine Realms of Qi Refining and is one of the most top-tier divine arts of its time. The Golden Pass and Jade Lock has twelve bodies, each body has one heavy barrier."

The old Daoist's voice suddenly rose, making the bronze crane incense burner on the altar hum. "With your current foundation of Golden Marrow Mercury Slush and Three Burners Containing Sword, cultivating it would be like boiling water melting snow!"

He took a sudden step forward, unable to resist reaching out to squeeze Xu Yunfan's shoulder. "If you can achieve the Nine Realms within twenty years, you might be able to use the residual spiritual energy of this world to seek a breakthrough beyond the limit..."

He suddenly stopped here.

Bi Sheng felt somewhat doubtful and squeezed again with his fingers. Something seemed off about his aptitude?

He flicked a strand of true qi from his fingertip, wanting to rush into Xu Yunfan's body to investigate, but the dragon scale armor plates suddenly fluttered violently, actually shattering this strand of true qi on the spot.

"Daozhang, isn't this a bit excessive?"

Xu Yunfan's shoulder twitched. His shoulder was like a loach as he slightly retreated, forcefully breaking free from Bi Sheng's grip.

"Eh?"

Bi Sheng was even more surprised. He truly hadn't expected Xu Yunfan to be able to break free from his grasp.

A sharp light flashed in his eyes. His right hand shot out like an eagle's claw again, the true qi at his fingertips condensing into a three-inch green glow as he aimed for Xu Yunfan's Jianjing acupoint.

Xu Yunfan's expression didn't change in the slightest. The blood and strength within his body churned, erupting from his toes in an instant. The dragon scale armor also provided external force. Xu Yunfan's toes lightly tapped the blue bricks, his figure floating backward like a willow catkin in the wind. The green glow brushed past the tip of his nose, carving five deep holes into the stone wall behind him.

"Good footwork!"

Bi Sheng's left hand suddenly flipped out from his sleeve, the Yin-Yang fish pattern of the Taiji appearing in his palm.

Xu Yunfan suddenly felt the surrounding air become viscous and stagnant. The dragon scale armor plates fluttered along with the undulation of his muscle strength, flowing like water waves, emitting a series of urgent chime sounds.

After the Nine Realms of Qi Refining, with true qi to protect the body, every move and stance was accompanied by true qi, having already transcended the level of close-quarters combat typical of ordinary martial artists.

No wonder, no wonder his master Zhan Yan once said that a supreme grandmaster of the Nine Realms of Qi Refining could only be defeated by experts of the same realm.

Relying on true qi, they could suppress everything below the Nine Realms.

If it weren't for the dragon scale armor he wore and the cultivation of multiple supreme arts, Bi Sheng's single move alone would have been enough to make an ordinary Bone Marrow Cleansing master kneel on the ground.

Just as the Yin-Yang fish was about to close, his right knee slightly bent, his left foot cleverly twisted between the brick seams, and his entire body actually seemed like a swimming fish wagging its tail, slipping out from the gap in the qi mechanism lock.

"Shifting Stars and Changing Constellations?" Bi Sheng finally changed his expression.

"Just the Spirit Ape Leap from the Flying Leg technique." Xu Yunfan's expression was calm. He had already cultivated the Flying Leg technique to perfection, and many of its moves had the effect of turning decay into magic.

"Flying Leg..."

Bi Sheng's expression was somewhat complex. He naturally knew this martial art. Although it was a lightness skill, it excelled in long-distance travel. To be able to use this move within a square inch of space was enough to show that the other party had cultivated the Flying Leg to its extreme.

The more he looked at Xu Yunfan, the more he liked him, and the more he regretted it.

Xu Yunfan's single move was enough to show that he was an extremely formidable person in actual combat. Ignoring martial arts realm, his combat quality alone absolutely crushed the vast majority of the Dao Sect's younger generation disciples.

The mountaintop was momentarily so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Only the light sound of wind brushing past the bronze bells on the eaves and the faint chirping of distant birds remained.

Bi Sheng's gaze was as calm as a deep pool, fixed on Xu Yunfan, while Xu Yunfan didn't relax either, his fingertips slightly hooked, the dragon scale armor plates silently fluttering in his sleeves, as if they could turn into a protective barrier at any moment.

Bi Sheng's heart was struggling. Although his eyes were deep, his mind was like a stormy sea.

This person's talent was astonishing, and he had even greater fortuitous encounters...

Time seemed to freeze at this moment.

Bi Sheng looked at the young man before him. The wariness between his brows, his tense shoulder line, and even the rhythm of his breathing were all controlled extremely steadily, showing he still hadn't let down his guard.

He sighed inwardly. This child's temperament was resilient. No wonder he could escape unscathed after several of his tests.

Lin Qingxuan beside him unconsciously held her breath, her fingertips slightly cold.

Being recognized by the Profound Sky Mirror, her spiritual perception far exceeded that of ordinary people. She could clearly sense the emotions churning like undercurrents beneath Bi Sheng's seemingly calm exterior—sometimes boiling, sometimes silent—as if weighing something.

She could even sense that Bi Sheng's fingers in his sleeve were unconsciously stroking the ancient jade ring on his thumb, a small habit he had when wavering.

Silence enveloped the three like a heavy curtain.

Xu Yunfan's spine was ramrod straight, the dragon scale armor plates silently fluttering, each scale adjusting to its best defensive stance.

His gaze remained fixed on Bi Sheng's shoulder line. That was the part that moved first before a martial artist attacked. Even for a Nine Realms Qi Refining master, his previous test had confirmed this was still the case.

The mountain wind swept past the ancient pine at the cliff edge, emitting a low moan.

In the distance, a lone eagle circled past, the shadow it cast fleeting across the stone steps.

After a long silence, looking at Xu Yunfan who remained fully focused and wary, Bi Sheng suddenly broke into a smile.

The smile came abruptly, but it instantly eased the tense atmosphere.

The true qi he had secretly gathered in his sleeve quietly dissipated, and even the pressure radiating from the cliff edge melted away like ice and snow.

"If young friend has no intention of becoming a disciple, if you don't mind, why not stay at the Dao Sect for a few days."

His voice was gentle, as if the confrontation just now had never happened. "Haomiao and Mushan also mention you often."

Since there were people Xu Yunfan knew in the Dao Sect and they had good relations, then building a good relationship would mean having a powerful figure in the future.

Perhaps later he could go to the Tiangong Cave to take a look and place some orders to strengthen the relationship.

Hearing these words, Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed slightly. He already understood that Bi Sheng had made his decision.

During the silence just now, he had been ready to activate the Lin Character Art at any moment. If necessary, he wouldn't hesitate to use everything at his disposal, detonating the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace in his hand to block the other party, and take the opportunity to jump off the cliff.

In the instant of silence just now, he had already operated the Lin Character Art to its peak, ready to enter the Lin Character State at any moment.

If Bi Sheng had chosen to make a move, this divine weapon would have instantly self-destructed under his explosive force, and the resulting shockwave would have been enough to blast away half the cliff.

And the abyss shrouded in clouds and mist thirty steps away was precisely his planned retreat route.

The dragon scale armor plates on his body were extended, and the steel machine box housing the Ginseng Baby could also extend tail wings, enough to let him glide an extremely long distance in the sky.

If controlled properly,借着 the east wind, he might be able to travel a thousand miles.

(This part I'm somewhat uncertain about, everyone please give your opinions. I've agonized over it for a long time. If it doesn't work, I'll revise it.)
