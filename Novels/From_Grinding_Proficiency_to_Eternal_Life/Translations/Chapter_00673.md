# Chapter 673: Finally Securing an Official Position

To be honest, maintaining any sense of pride or unyielding spirit under the gaze of such an existence would be truly foolish.

Fortunately, the gaze did not last long.

A moment later, the boundless pressure receded like a tidal wave.

Xu Yunfan clearly felt that the gaze had lingered for a split second on the wisp of heart incense he had offered—a wisp containing the true nature of the Divine Skies and the意境 of the Profound Vault's Immortality—and even revealed a faint yet genuine trace of satisfaction.

Then, the gaze vanished, as if it had never appeared.

Xu Yunfan felt his back drenched in cold sweat.

That Primordial Dao Lord had just been looking at him.

"Good."

The voice of Universal Deliverance True Lord rang out again, carrying a tone of relief and hidden delight.

He stood up, his face regaining that compassionate and peaceful smile, and his gaze toward Xu Yunfan now held a bit more genuine closeness and recognition.

"It seems the Dao Lord is very satisfied with your recent advancement to the Golden Core. You have done well, Junior Brother Xu."

Xu Yunfan, still shaken, asked, "True Lord, that gaze just now was...?"

"Naturally, it was the Dao Lord."

Universal Deliverance True Lord's tone was filled with reverence.

"Only by achieving the Golden Core, condensing a true Dao Fruit, can one truly step onto the threshold of pursuing the Primordial Dao, and only then does one qualify to draw a sliver of the Dao Lord's attention and enter his vision.

The heart incense you just offered contained the true meaning of your Dao Foundation. The Dao Lord reviewed it and recognized the direction of your path—the Divine Skies' Destruction and the Profound Vault's Immortality—hence his satisfaction.

This is a great honor and also a protective talisman. In your future actions, you must comprehend the Dao Lord's intent from today."

Only by being acknowledged by the Dao Lord can one be considered a true core disciple of the Primordial Sect.

So that's how it is. Below the Golden Core, all are expendable materials. Only upon achieving the Golden Core does one gain an official position.

Xu Yunfan's heart was enlightened, and at the same time, a strong yearning surged within him.

The realm of the Dao Lord—what kind of不可思议 realm must that be?

"I understand, Senior Brother," he replied respectfully, the longing for the Nascent Soul Dao Embryo realm burning even hotter in his heart.

Universal Deliverance True Lord said, "I recall that among the Nine Immortal Mountains, one was left behind by the previous Divine Skies Nine Palaces True Lord. It should be very suitable for you."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. If it was indeed a mountain left by the previous Divine Skies Nine Palaces True Lord, wouldn't that mean he could take over a ready-made estate?

Good, very good!

Xu Yunfan was overjoyed; he loved taking over ready-made things.

After leaving the Primordial Palace, Universal Deliverance True Lord gave a few simple instructions on the precautions for selecting an immortal mountain and then let Xu Yunfan go on his own.

After leaving Chenghua Mountain, Xu Yunfan did not immediately go to select a mountain. Instead, he hovered in the void, overlooking the nine immortal mountains below, each with its unique aura and faintly visible laws.

He closed his eyes and focused his mind. His spiritual sense spread out like an invisible net, carefully sensing the primordial aura and fluctuations of the laws emitted by each immortal mountain.

Purple Void Mountain, with its purple mist and natural Dao charm.

Jade Capital Mountain, with its brilliant and majestic immortal light.

Tiandu Peak, towering into the clouds, drawing in starlight.

You Bamboo Valley, shrouded in ghostly aura, with countless ghosts lurking within.

Blood Soul Cliff, with its sky-reaching killing intent and blood-red light...

Each immortal mountain represents the manifestation of a powerful law attribute, and each is itself a massive energy source and a node of the heavenly and earthly laws.

Cultivating on one of these mountains, especially in a path close to its nature, would undoubtedly yield twice the result with half the effort.

His spiritual sense brushed past like a gentle breeze, sensing the resonance with his own Divine Skies Golden Core.

The Divine Skies Dao Fruit is supremely yang and destroys all laws, while the Profound Vault's imagery requires vastness to evolve the heavens and earth.

Finally, his spiritual sense locked onto a mountain in the northwest—a mountain with a strangely steep body that pierces the heavens, its peak perpetually shrouded in violent thunderclouds!

The thunderclouds were not formed naturally but were woven from pure thunder laws. Countless purple serpents of lightning roared within the clouds, emanating an aura intertwined with destruction and life force. It resonated strongly with the Divine Skies Golden Core within Xu Yunfan's dantian.

This mountain's rules are stable, its space vast, and it contains immense energy sourced from the same origin as Divine Skies power. It is the best field for evolving a thunder cave-heaven.

It was most likely a mountain painstakingly constructed by the previous Divine Skies Nine Palaces True Lord.

There was no doubt about it.

Only a fool wouldn't know what to choose.

He moved, transforming into a streak of light and arriving before the mountain shrouded in thunderclouds.

The entire mountain was a dark purple color, its texture as hard as divine iron, and it was naturally branded with countless profound thunder runes.

At the summit, there was a huge platform, as if leveled by an immense force. On the platform stood a monolithic stone tablet of an ancient style, entwined with thunder patterns.

On the tablet were three ancient seal script characters, as if naturally carved by the heavenly and earthly thunder.

Divine Skies Mountain.

"Divine Skies Mountain..."

Xu Yunfan read the name aloud, a smile curling at the corner of his mouth.

"The previous True Lord's naming is perfectly to my liking. This place is destined to be my Dao field!"

He raised his hand, gathering his mind and spirit. The tip of his finger, infused with Divine Skies magical power and spiritual sense, carrying the Dao charm of a newly promoted True Lord, pointed toward the stone tablet from afar.

The moment his fingertip was about to touch the stone tablet, the entire Divine Skies Mountain shook violently.

Rumble!

All the thunder runes on the mountain's surface lit up instantly, bursting forth with a dazzling purple-gold light.

The violent thunderclouds that had perpetually lingered at the peak, as if summoned, surged downward madly, transforming into a thick pillar of purple-gold lightning that struck Xu Yunfan precisely.

Xu Yunfan did not dodge or evade, allowing the lightning pillar to fall upon him. He only felt a pleasant numbness throughout his body, as if he had undergone a deep spa treatment, and he let out a comfortable sigh.

The Nine Immortal Mountains of the Primordial Sect are extremely profound. The accumulation of Divine Skies Mountain over a thousand years is all contained within this purple-gold lightning pillar.

It is the baptism and gift from the mountain's primordial source to its new master.

The vast and pure thunder primordial power, far surpassing that of the original Divine Skies Peak by hundreds of times, mixed with the Dao charm accumulated by Divine Skies Mountain over a thousand years, surged madly into Xu Yunfan's body.

The Divine Skies Golden Core in his dantian, like a long drought meeting sweet rain, emitted joyous dragon roars and thunderous rumbles, greedily devouring this power of the same origin.

The ninety-nine purple-gold divine dragons on the surface of the Golden Core became even more solid and lively, spewing out thunder primordial energy that was increasingly powerful and pure.

The cave-heaven evolving within the Golden Core, nourished by this primordial power, seemed to have its spatial barriers solidified a bit, and the thunder generated within carried an even richer Dao charm of destruction and generation.

At the same time, countless pieces of information about Divine Skies Mountain poured into his mind.

The mountain's structure, the trends of its earth veins, the foundation nodes of the mountain protection array, several thunder secret realms within the mountain, and the location of the core control hub...

The authority over the entire mountain was transferring to him.

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes, suspended within the lightning pillar, and fully operated the *Divine Skies Nine Palaces Profound Vault Immortality True Scripture*.

He no longer suppressed it but instead guided this irresistible Divine Skies primordial power to wash and temper his Divine Skies physique and Golden Core.

The purple-gold lightning completely enveloped him, forming a huge cocoon of light.

Powerful ripples of laws spread outward from its center, announcing that one of the Nine Immortal Mountains of the Primordial Sect.

Divine Skies Mountain, henceforth had a new master.

Divine Skies True Lord.
