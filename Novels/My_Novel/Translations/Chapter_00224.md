# Chapter 224: Enemy Attack Disrupts Recovery

Dusk settled, casting a golden hue over the bamboo forest.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang had left the city behind, traveling for a day before resting among the bamboo. The breeze was gentle here, filled with the breath of spring, and the scenery was beautiful.

There was an abandoned hut in the woods. Li Xian knocked on the door and gently pushed it open. The interior was old and dusty, with a bamboo bed covered in grime.

Seeing that night was approaching and no pursuers were in sight, Li Xian deduced that the forces of the Taixin Sect and the Rain Sword Tower had been intimidated by the skeletons and dared not chase further. However, to be cautious, he concealed their tracks along the way, leaving no trace of their passage.

They decided to stay in the hut temporarily.

He executed the Azure Silk Palm, his palms swirling in the air. His Inner Qi condensed without dispersing, transforming into a vortex of energy. Containing the momentum of crashing waves, it sucked in the dust within the room.

He then pushed it out the window. Dust clouds rolled away, clearing up eighty percent of the filth. However, the place had been uninhabited for so long that green mold had grown on the walls, which was difficult to deal with. Li Xian said apologetically, "I'm afraid you'll have to lower yourself to stay here, Madam."

Wen Caishang smiled. "Walking the martial world, how can everything go as one wishes? I understand this principle." She took off her boots and socks, sitting cross-legged on the wooden bed. Her white skirt covered her tender, white feet.

Li Xian went outside to patrol the forest, hiding their footprints. He thought to himself, "The Madam is injured, but her strength is formidable. Even in the most dangerous situations, she can protect herself. I, on the other hand, cannot say the same. If the situation becomes critical, she might not hesitate to abandon me. Therefore... I must be as careful as possible to ensure my own safety."

Seeing the lush bamboo forest and thriving vegetation, he took a bell from his backpack, tied it tightly with a silkworm thread, and stretched it taut between two bamboo stalks.

If anyone walked past, the bell would ring.

"Traveling outside relies on caution. My strength is still weak, so I must make up for it with this. Once all matters are settled, I need to cultivate in seclusion and accumulate strength!"

Li Xian set up his traps; at the slightest movement, he would be able to detect it.

He recalled the journey of forty-nine thousand miles by water, the banquets for viewing and slaying the dragon, and the various strong experts and strange people, each with their own特长 and displaying their unique powers. He was still young; although he had achieved profound mastery in the martial arts he practiced, his understanding of martial principles was narrow, his vision shallow, and it was greatly insufficient.

After setting up the warnings around them, Li Xian patted his backpack. Seeing the herbs were still there, he needed to find a way to boil them for Wen Caishang. But lacking porcelain utensils, it was quite troublesome. Looking around, he suddenly saw a very thick bamboo.

He drew his horizontal blade and劈ed, taking the hollow end to make a simple bamboo pot. He piled up firewood, filled it with water, and added the herbs to boil. Li Xian had been walking for half a day and felt hungry. He used the time while the medicine was boiling to look for food.

He searched along the way. Every spring and summer, all things revive, and the bamboo forest is full of snakes and beasts. The Yihe Village also had a bamboo forest where Li Xian patrolled and caught snakes, becoming quite skilled at it. He easily found a snake nest and reached out to grab it. Pinching the three-inch vital point of a venomous snake, he gave a slight shake, and it died instantly. In this way... Li Xian caught two venomous snakes and also dug up some tender bamboo shoots.

He skinned the snakes, removed their fangs, and剔除 their internal organs. With the sweet bamboo shoots, he cooked a pot of "Green Bamboo Sweet Shoot Snake Soup." The taste was fresh, fragrant, sweet, and refreshing, full of the feeling of spring.

Li Xian ladled a bowl and placed it inside the hut. He closed the bamboo door and practiced martial arts outside.

[Misty Legs]
[Proficiency: 10569/20000 (Perfected)]

The leg technique was elusive, gathering water vapor. Li Xian practiced diligently, his proficiency accumulating like an abyss. When he grew tired, he switched to other martial arts. Azure Silk Palm, Four Directions Fist, Breeze Leg, Great Luo Blade Technique...

He practiced一遍又一遍, reviewing the old to learn the new, delving deep into martial principles. His body resembled the heavens and earth, resonating with the martial arts, freely evolving. His performance was outstanding.

Suddenly, in an instant... Li Xian seemed to gain an insight, looking out at the green fields and bamboo forest. He felt the world was more beautiful, all things were independent yet connected, brilliant and colorful.

[You have meticulously studied various martial arts, advanced your understanding of martial principles, and comprehended the trait 'Seeing the World'.]

Seeing the world, understanding the world.

Martial arts are derived from the heavens and earth. Being good at observing the heavens and earth and comprehending them brings a joy and subtlety that is hard to put into words.

[You have diligently practiced martial arts, reached the 'Refining Essence' stage, Proficiency +1]
[Refining Essence]
[Proficiency: 95/100]

Martial arts, cultivation, and knowledge... all have improved.

Wen Caishang practiced internally, nurturing her body. Her condition improved somewhat. When she opened her eyes, there was a bowl of spring shoot and snake soup in the room, with a light and sweet flavor.

She couldn't help but sip it lightly. The taste was mild but not dull, hiding the charm of the wild spring. Wen Caishang sipped it slowly, smiling softly: "This kid's cooking skills have improved again, I wonder when he learned it."

Li Xian pushed the door open and brought in the medicinal soup. Wen Caishang nodded, feeling comforted in her heart: "Xiao Xian is smart and cautious, and has a sense of propriety. For many things, he can do them perfectly without me saying a word!" She took it and drank it all. The medicinal power took effect, and the color returned to her face.

Wen Caishang instructed: "Go stand guard outside. If there's any movement, wake me up."

Li Xian knew that traveling with the Madam meant not worrying about money, but he was always busy. He might not sleep tonight, but he didn't say much, practicing martial arts and standing guard outside the door.

Wen Caishang drank the medicinal soup and sat down again. Her hair flowed slightly, her face clean and flawless. She closed her eyes and practiced her technique, her body exuding a faint fragrance. Moonlight shone down, giving off a unique charm.

The Silkworm Garment Jade-Crossing Art was a world-famous profound technique, vast and profound. It covered an extremely wide range: martial killing moves, internal breath training, and cultivating one's body and mind.

She circulated the "Winter Silkworm Slumber Breath Method," a supreme technique within the Silkworm Garment Jade-Crossing Art. Relying solely on internal breath to nurture the body, one could fully recover from injuries. Although Wen Caishang had high attainments, she found it difficult to achieve this.

But circulating this technique internally was greatly helpful for her injuries. In this way, the night passed. Wen Caishang stopped her internal breath, straightened her clothes, and they set off again.

Li Xian retrieved the bell and silkworm thread. He took out the map, confirmed their location, and planned to head south.

They walked for two days, moving quite slowly. But not seeing any pursuers, they felt slightly relieved. Li Xian asked, "Madam, how is your injury?"

Wen Caishang smiled without speaking; her situation was stabilizing. If no strong experts pursued and killed her, forcing her to use her Inner Qi, she was considered unharmed. Her self-healing ability was extremely strong; a sword wound three inches deep would heal very quickly. But the injuries from the heavenly thunder and the Vajra Palm power were the most persistent, making it difficult to recover for a long time.

Li Xian remained cautious, concealing their tracks and walking slowly. He didn't seek speed but stability.

On this day, Li Xian chose a secluded mountain path to travel. Suddenly, he heard beastly roars from all sides. Li Xian immediately became alert, and Wen Caishang frowned.

Wen Caishang was quite surprised, but her expression remained unchanged. She joked, "Xiao Xian, it seems some wicked beasts have come looking for us."

Then they heard shouts from all sides: "Demoness, today is your death day!" mixed with sounds of hatred.

Four figures surrounded them from four directions, riding four different types of strange beasts: "Tiger," "Deer," "Serpent," and "Dog," all looking majestic and extraordinary.

Wen Caishang said, "I smelled the beast stink long ago. So it really is you four old wicked beasts. What... I spared your lives back then, and now you've come to die again?"

These four people were incomplete. The one riding the tiger had no feet, the one riding the deer had no arms, the one riding the serpent had half his face sliced off, and the one riding the dog had all four limbs but was crippled below.

Wen Caishang said, "The Four Beasts of the Taixin Sect, long time no see. You've come a long way to see this young lady, but I have nothing good to offer."

"只好送尔归西 (I can only send you to the West [to die])."

Li Xian sensed something unusual about Wen Caishang; things seemed to be outside her expectations. Her words were cold, her killing intent fierce, but she had lost some of her usual composure.

Hearing the words "Four Beasts of the Taixin Sect," the four were filled with indescribable hatred. The Taixin Sect was located on Taixin Mountain, where wild beasts roamed. Therefore, the sect's martial arts often involved the assistance of beasts.

These four had once been very famous, known as the "Four Heroes of the Taixin Sect," high-spirited and extremely glorious. After encountering Wen Caishang, they became infatuated, were manipulated by her, and eventually all ended up crippled.

Only later did they realize the truth, and their hatred accumulated.

The one standing on the strange dog, his lower body disabled, said, "Wen Caishang, you underestimate our determination to kill you!"

"Hahaha." The one lying on the tiger's back, his face full of pleasure, said, "Wen Caishang, I heard you suffered heavy injuries at the Dragon Appreciation Banquet. Shall we old friends check your injuries for you? Hahaha!"

"Presumptuous!" Wen Caishang roared in anger.

Li Xian thought to himself, "Not good. Although the Madam is seriously injured, it was caused by heavenly lightning and the martial madman. This tiger rider mentions the injury from the Dragon Appreciation Banquet, showing he is testing the waters and has reservations. The Madam is usually calm and composed and would never fall for such a clumsy trick. But her angry shout just now confirmed it."

Wen Caishang usually planned things with full certainty. Recently, she had been plagued by bad luck and suffered setbacks several times. She already had frustration in her heart, and now seeing the four—Tiger, Deer, Serpent, and Dog—come looking for her, it made her extremely annoyed.

The Sanskrit chant echoed in her body, disturbing her mind. It was inevitable that she was not as composed as before.

Wen Caishang's anger instantly vanished. She knew she had been exposed and said with a soft smile, "It doesn't matter, none of you four will live!" She flipped her sleeve and drew her sword, a silver light stabbing towards the tiger rider.

The tiger rider had both legs completely broken, and his martial arts had been hindered for a time. But over the past decade, he had trained his hands intensely, making up for his shortcomings. He slapped the tiger's back with both palms and leaped into the air. The strange beast seemed to have intelligence and pounced fiercely at Wen Caishang.

The other three attacked instantly. Although they had disabilities and terrifying appearances, their strange beasts compensated for their weaknesses, as if facing strong enemies from all directions. Wen Caishang sneered and said, "In more than ten years, you haven't improved at all."

Sword lights flashed in all directions, her sword moves exquisite, her killing momentum fierce. Her figure was light and graceful, her sword strikes like a startled swan, beautiful and magnificent.

The four were both shocked and angry. They had expected this demoness to be even more厉害 after not seeing her for more than ten years and were already extremely cautious. But upon exchanging blows, it was still beyond expectations, and they felt great difficulty.

After a few moves, they were already at a disadvantage.

Li Xian observed from the side, thinking: "The Madam is intentionally conserving her physical strength and Inner Qi. The moves she uses seem very basic. But basic martial arts, when evolved by her, become extremely powerful."

Wen Caishang's eyes flashed with killing intent, executing the "Breeze Continuous Sword." This was a basic martial art, but it had reached the "Peak Perfection" level. When she used it, its killing power was not insignificant.

The sword tip raised a breeze, hiding a锋 edge within the softness. With a light flick of her long sword, the breeze blew towards her opponents, cutting their skin and flesh.

Although surrounded by the tiger beast experts, this sword technique was excellent in both attack and defense. No matter if it was a泰山压顶 (泰山 pressing down) or a torrential storm, she would simply receive it with a breeze.

Li Xian was well-versed in the "Breeze Leg." Although it was also a basic martial art, there were differences in quality. The Breeze Continuous Sword seemed like a meticulously crafted basic martial art, more like the foundation of a certain martial arts school.

Wen Caishang conserved her Inner Qi and raised her eyebrows. "You废物,妄想伤我 (You scum, delusional to think you can hurt me)?" The sword tip spun, and in a flash, the four were covered in blood, extremely狼狈 (disheveled).

Soon, the tiger rider was wounded in the left shoulder and had a three-inch-long cut in his abdomen. The serpent rider had one eye pierced...

Wen Caishang prepared to execute a killing move.

Just then, the one riding the dog beast shouted, "Run!" He stepped on the dog beast and flew away, using the "beast" to drive his lightness skill.

Wen Caishang was greatly surprised. Lightness skill martial arts in the world were created by humans. Naturally, they required a human body to practice. The dog beast moved on all fours, its posture and habits completely different from a human. How could it use lightness skill?

She then saw the strange tiger running away, using the "Frenzied Shocking Heaven Step." This footwork required配合 (cooperation) with "sound," one step, one shout.

The strange tiger's roar was like thunder, perfectly matching this lightness skill. With each震荡 (tremor), it had already run far away.

She also saw the great serpent curling into a ball, wrapping its master, and rolling down the mountain... They all displayed their skills and escaped far away in an instant.

It turned out...

The four had long known Wen Caishang's厉害ness and vaguely guessed that even联手 (joining forces) would be difficult to win. Over the past decade, they had practiced lightness skill intensely, making it extremely powerful. Wen Caishang could catch up to one, but it was hard to catch up to all four.

Wen Caishang's expression was unsightly. She was too lazy to chase and sheathed her sword, thinking: "I didn't expect such a motley crew to be so annoying!" She was already feeling frustrated.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, they already know you're injured."

"This is indeed my fault." Wen Caishang said solemnly, "This attack was fierce, and it's truly troublesome. Xiao Xian, for the rest of the journey, we must be extremely careful!"

She thought to herself: "These sect forces have many people and can form formations, which would indeed make me expend some effort. My injuries have not healed, and I keep getting attacked. This is truly extremely unfavorable."

Her eyes hid worry. She had no fear of the major sects. Although her injuries were not light, escaping from a siege would not be difficult. What she worried about in her heart was her fortune.

She was hindered everywhere, frustrated everywhere.

Wen Caishang thought again: "The Seventy-Two Earthly Treasures, how could they be easily obtained? Even with setbacks, it is normal."
