## Chapter 178: Sweeping the Six Directions

"Ordinary newcomers standing here can't see this town at all," said Wu Yaozu, who looked older than his years.

In front, the entire brightly lit town was bustling with people coming and going. Only those whose consciousness could leave their body could perceive it. Otherwise, just like ordinary people cannot see "Yin Gods" wandering at night, they wouldn't notice even if they walked past it. Everyone came here in a dream, not in their true bodies. Presumably, the town under the night fog must also be very strange.

"Want to go in and have a look?" This time, Wu Yaozu extended the invitation.

Although Qin Ming was tempted to explore, he still restrained himself. He was well aware of his condition; the silk script scriptures, which had become a flesh-and-blood instinct, only temporarily suppressed all his techniques. It was merely a stopgap, not a fundamental cure. If he were to "roam spiritually," unlike others, his Heavenly Light Qi would condense with his consciousness and accompany him. At this stage, it wasn't stable yet, and he feared "setting off fireworks" in the strange town.

Qin Ming asked, "Brother Wu, have you found a badly fallen corpse nearby? There should be a brilliant five-colored treasure bottle beside her." He couldn't forget that bottle of Heavenly Light Liquid. If not for his body's issues, he would have gone to look for it long ago.

Wu Yaozu shook his head and said, "I didn't notice. I'll help you look for it later."

Late at night, the small courtyard emitted a faint golden light, appearing slightly sacred. The strange town was very popular, with people doing business and others strolling around. Beings from all walks of life were present, but they seemed unable to see through the courtyard. Wu Yaozu was quite at ease here. He left his physical body in the courtyard, and a "rainbow light" flew out from within him, landing in the town. He then went off to explore.

A young man with a vertical eye between his brows asked, "Little Wu, surely someone hasn't moved into that courtyard, have they? The lights there are unusual."

Soon, acquaintances came over one after another to greet Wu Yaozu, evidently having entered this dream realm more than once. A moon insect descended from the night sky, transforming into a silver-armored youth. He said, "That's not simple. His physical body is in that small courtyard, meaning he came here from reality? Little Wu, introduce your friend to us." Immediately, a man with golden horns on his head laughed, "How about I organize a gathering and invite two divine maidens to drink with us? We can meet in town."

In the night, within the small courtyard emitting a faint golden glow, Qin Ming's body rumbled with thunder and blazed with fire. He was attempting to resolve his "root cause of illness." If he didn't thoroughly eradicate it now, in the future, he would inevitably end up like the patriarchs who practiced this technique, reaching a point of no return and ultimately exploding with a bang.

He had two lines of thought. One was that prevention was better than cure; to arrange the "subdued" and "tamed" Heavenly Light Qi throughout various parts of his body. For instance, the heart inherently belongs to fire, perfectly matching the Lihuo Scripture, while the lungs belong to metal, aligning with the Golden Silkworm Scripture. Following this, all five-element attributes would settle in the five viscera, while other scriptures and techniques, once "subdued," could be arranged elsewhere. At that point, Qin Ming would use the principles of the silk script scriptures to dispatch and wield the cohesive force to its utmost, controlling all techniques throughout his body. In this way, when different divine glows bloomed from various parts of his body, they might even combine to produce unknown wondrous powers. This was because the content on the single page of true transmission from each sect's ancestral hall was constantly being experimented with, combining various elements to construct the strongest Heavenly Light Qi. However, operating in this manner would require him to have extremely precise and subtle control over his entire body. Otherwise, any imbalance in a single aspect would inevitably lead to significant trouble. Moreover, the silk script technique wasn't just about cohesive force; it could manifest various types of energy. Using it this way would be somewhat wasteful.

The other line of thought was to break without establishing, to sweep everything away, to pierce through, and to discard any techniques that couldn't be retained. Just like King Qin sweeping the six directions and devouring the world, all techniques and scriptures would ultimately "standardize written script and gauge of axles," achieving grand unification and finally becoming emperor. However, operating with this approach was simply too difficult.

Qin Ming had tried many times. When he refined the True Scripture with World Fire, he found that it burned not only the Heavenly Light Qi but also himself. Ordinary people would find it very difficult to endure. Furthermore, he felt that World Fire wasn't enough. He considered introducing thunder-fire, like refining a Dragon-Tiger Grand Medicine internally, to stew all the Heavenly Light Qi. However, the thunder-fire couldn't be the Purple Mansion Thunder-Fire Qi; it had to be replaced by the silk script technique. Next, he drew upon the records in the "Fate Changing Scripture," repeatedly attempting the "borrowing heaven to change fate" method on himself. Later still, the Overlord's methods and some ideas from the Spirit Field realm also inspired Qin Ming, emphasizing leveraging "the grand momentum" for one's own use. Of course, he was still far from the Spirit Field realm. He could only use his body as a battlefield, leveraging "momentum" to hammer and smash the Heavenly Light Qi.

Qin Ming discovered that the "sweeping the six directions" approach was feasible, but it had a severe problem: the requirements for one's own aptitude were simply too high. If one wasn't careful, this wouldn't be refining a true technique; it would be refining oneself into "ash." He estimated that if all those methods were used, tormenting himself, repeatedly sweeping through, and piercing through all true techniques to achieve grand unification, his foundational value would need to reach at least 1500. According to the people from the Six Imperial Ancestral Courts, the initial foundation wasn't measured in jin (a unit of weight) but as a potential value. The initial foundation of an eccentric person was close to 1000. Even patriarch-level figures in their youth, after various "torments"—such as entering mountain and river spirit nests or consuming dragon blood—might not necessarily reach 1500. This meant that the silk script technique indeed had a significant problem, as few people met the conditions to resolve its hidden dangers. Moreover, that 1500 was merely Qin Ming's rough estimate of the minimum value.

For a moment, his face paled. He had indeed surpassed the minimum value, but in this process, it was very likely to soar to a peak value. He believed that past patriarchs must have also researched it and had ideas for solutions, but most likely gave up because their initial foundational values couldn't keep up.

Qin Ming immediately thought of the refined silk script technique in the divine temple. He wanted to draw upon that patriarch's ideas, which might lower the requirements on himself. However, the kind stone statue old grandma revealed to him that the place was extremely dangerous. Unless he could resolve his own hidden dangers, entering would result in death. Qin Ming vaguely guessed that entering the divine temple might not be about cultivation realm, but rather a high standard of "flawlessness" required for one's own path. This was quite troublesome. To enter the divine temple, he first had to solve his own problems, but to perfectly resolve the hidden dangers, he hoped to draw upon that patriarch's ideas, seeming to be caught in a dead loop.

He also subtly inquired if the old grandma was capable of entering the temple to help him examine the scriptures. However, the old woman shook her head, telling him that few people could reach that place, and even she could not, because the owner of the divine temple was simply too powerful. In the past, the old man who practiced the silk script technique was indeed outrageously powerful. He debated the Dao with the owner there for three days and four nights, and finally walked out alive.

"In the end, I still have to rely on myself," Qin Ming murmured. He had an idea. His current initial foundation was astonishingly strong, so he could give it a try. "Even if 'sweeping the six directions' cannot be carried through to the end, I can combine it with the first approach. Let's give it a try first."

Immediately, eerie firelight blazed up, accompanied by startling thunder, and Qin Ming once again set about resolving his own problems. He tried day and night, his mind and body exhausted, his eyes bloodshot. During this time, various Heavenly Light Qi currents fiercely resisted, rebelling several times. This made him even more determined that the root of the problem had to be eliminated now. During this period, he recited the silk script technique, the Fate Changing Scripture, the Overlord's spirit field, World Fire, Purple Mansion internal refinement, and other techniques until he knew them backward and forward, studying them countless times.

"The most complex problems need to be extremely simplified; they cannot be overly intricate."

In the end, Qin Ming went all out. He felt that wanting everything would ultimately result in getting nothing. After reviewing these scriptures, he decided to simply proceed with the most fundamental approach. In the early days, the predecessors on the path of 'new life' would consume strange medicinal herbs during battles with giant beasts, causing their severely injured bodies to mutate. "Now, my Heavenly Light Qi has issues, which is equivalent to my body being injured and unwell. I need to concoct a medicine to solve this fatal problem."

The Fate Changing Scripture contained methods for concocting medicine, capable of extracting even the essence of strange blood. The source of ingredients, naturally, would be the various Heavenly Light Qi. As for fire, it would certainly not be lacking. The silk script technique could manifest wind-fire, thunder-fire, Lihuo, and so on. Combined with World Fire, Qin Ming directly began. Not long after, he let out a muffled groan. Some of the "medicinal ingredients" inside him had burned, nearly backfiring on him. "If once isn't enough, then ten times, a hundred times... a thousand times!" Of course, he didn't wish for that many attempts. No matter how high his initial foundational value was, it couldn't withstand such consumption. If he exceeded the peak value even once, it would be his own body that was swept away and pierced through.

Wu Yaozu, who had been gone for five days, returned and saw the messy small courtyard. Qin Ming looked as if he had been smoked and scorched by fire, with some parts of his body charred, appearing extremely disheveled. Even the courtyard walls bore traces of fire, and the vegetable garden was nearly destroyed. The old hen had regrown a new set of vibrant feathers, as it too had been scorched once. Clearly, it was no ordinary domestic chicken.

"Are you concocting medicine?" Wu Yaozu asked in surprise, because he smelled a faint clear fragrance, not with his nose, but with his "conscious perception."

"Yes," Qin Ming nodded. As he spoke, his abdomen glowed brightly, illuminating his entire body from within, making him appear almost transparent. Wu Yaozu was dumbfounded. In Qin Ming's abdomen, he saw a divine pill, perfectly round and incredibly brilliant. Purple qi steamed, golden mists coiled, and silver light radiated in all directions, intertwined with various luminous fogs, appearing extremely mystical. Then, he saw that peculiar grand medicine spinning rapidly, like a whirlwind sweeping away scattered clouds, gathering all Heavenly Light, essence, qi, and spirit, converging towards it. All of Qin Ming's essence was being combined into the medicine; his accumulated divine wisdom and spiritual light of consciousness had also merged into it.

Wu Yaozu exclaimed in admiration, "What magnificent medicine! It must be a supreme-grade, unparalleled treasure pill! Wait, no, this can't be consumed; that's a person, not a grand medicine."

At this moment, the true pill shattered, becoming a dazzling light, appearing humanoid and similar to Qin Ming. Then, it decomposed, transforming into countless streams of light that rushed towards various parts of his flesh and blood. This was the result of Qin Ming's attempts. He had compounded the medicine countless times. After fusion, it would spontaneously burst open, primarily to make the Heavenly Light Qi become a unified whole. World Fire refined the true technique, repeatedly.

Qin Ming felt it was almost complete; all the Heavenly Light Qi had finally been refined into one entity. During this period, it was extremely dangerous. His body was almost pierced through, World Fire scorched his flesh, and thunder bombarded his crown. He encountered peril multiple times, enduring extreme hardship. He no longer wished to recall this process, as it was simply too terrifying, practically a battle for his life! For him, this was the most primitive form of compounding medicine, ultimately to be consumed by his own flesh and blood.

The kind old grandma sensed something and was startled. Her pure Yang consciousness and spiritual light left the stone statue, reappearing in the small courtyard. "You've resolved your own problem?" she asked, her white hair flowing, a strange look on her face.

Qin Ming nodded, "I believe the medicine compounding has reached a satisfactory stage. If I could obtain the refined scriptures of that senior, I might be able to sublimate it further."

The old woman showed surprise, saying, "To combine Heavenly Light Qi into medicine and then nourish oneself with it—this demands an exceptionally high level of innate talent. That old man from before also had this idea, and his thinking was quite mature, but he believed no one possessed the necessary conditions. And you actually verified it for him." She felt that Qin Ming should now be able to go to the end of the town, to the divine temple, and give it a try.

Wu Yaozu immediately perked up, saying, "Many friends from various places in town want to meet you, and some are even arranging to invite two... uh, invite us for drinks."

The old woman immediately rebuked him, saying, "Do you know who they are in reality? They all come from significant backgrounds, and you dare to get so close to them!"
