# Chapter 60: News of a Second-Tier Alchemist

Ever since his spiritual power surged and gave rise to spiritual sense, Lu Xu noticed his talisman crafting efficiency had ascended to a new level. Now, his spiritual power could support nearly twice the previous limit for crafting talismans. Naturally, his talisman production saw a significant increase.

To sell more talismans, Lu Xu hired two more employees, both at Qi Condensation Level Three. Yifang Zhai, originally just a small talisman shop, gradually transformed into a medium-sized establishment with four employees. It sold mid-grade and low-grade talismans, as well as precious elixirs like Qi Replenishing Pills and Spirit Nourishing Pills. Lu Xu’s skill in talisman crafting and alchemy was indeed high, and the shop’s reputation gradually spread among the lower-tier cultivators in Wanxian City.

Because his production capacity was so high, Lu Xu always claimed to have an entire family backing him to avoid drawing external attention. This was not uncommon; most shops in Wanxian City were run by cultivation families, with individual shop owners being a minority.

Thus, in days filled with talisman crafting, alchemy, and researching formations, a year slowly passed. This was Lu Xu’s fifth year in Wanxian City. Ever since his cultivation gradually improved, time seemed to fly by exceptionally fast.

By the end of the year, Lu Xu summarized his gains: Yifang Zhai had earned him two thousand spirit stones within the year. The two older employees each received fifty spirit stones in salary, while the two new employees, still unfamiliar with the routines and not yet performing well, each only received twenty spirit stones.

“Life is getting better day by day! By next year, those two newcomers should also be proficient in their work!”

“An annual income of three thousand spirit stones isn’t a dream!”

After calculating, Lu Xu was filled with hope for the future. He stood in his courtyard, watching three beams of light dance before him. They were the lights of three magical artifacts: the Green Aura Sword, the Golden Light Mirror, and the Green Wood Shield. Wielding multiple magical artifacts with spiritual sense was a technique Lu Xu had been honing for a long time. He believed that if he encountered any combat in the future, he would surely give his enemies a surprise.

“I have another replication opportunity this year. What experience can I replicate now? It seems there’s not much left worth replicating!”

“Artifact forging is useless even if I replicate it now; it would be a waste of spirit stones. The Azure Wood Art experience is already maxed out.”

“There aren't many first-tier experiences worth replicating. I need to find a way to replicate second-tier experiences. There's a second-tier high-grade formation master in Wanxian City; I must find a way to contact him!”

“And the experience of a second-tier alchemist! If I want to refine Foundation Establishment Pills myself, I absolutely must replicate that experience!”

Lu Xu turned his gaze towards the Inner City. The experiences he wanted to replicate were almost all located there, but contacting people from the Inner City was incredibly difficult. Especially beings like second-tier alchemists and second-tier formation masters, their status was far more respected than even ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators.

“A single point of first-tier high-grade experience already costs ten spirit stones. How expensive must second-tier experience be? I still need to work hard to accumulate spirit stones!” Lu Xu thought to himself.

He had one replication opportunity each year, but in the past, he had wasted many of these opportunities. The main reason for not replicating was simply not being able to find suitable targets. While it was true that everyone had experiences useful to him, many experiences, once replicated, could not be monetized quickly. On the contrary, they would waste a lot of his precious, limited spirit stones. He needed to save them for replicating high-tier experiences and for purchasing raw materials for alchemy and formations. He couldn’t waste them on things that wouldn't take effect quickly, or whose effects, even if they did, wouldn't be very significant. Given this, he would rather waste an opportunity than replicate these low-value experiences.

“The more it comes to this, the more I realize the importance of information. I wonder if Fellow Daoist Yuan from Fengxin Pavilion can bring me the information I want this time!”

With this thought, Lu Xu put away his three magical artifacts and walked out. In his five years in Wanxian City, he had not only become familiar with the various surface industries of the city but had also gradually gained an understanding of some hidden aspects. Lu Xu had already attended several secret shops, secret market trade fairs, and intelligence trade fairs. Fengxin Pavilion was an organization in Wanxian City specializing in selling intelligence, and Lu Xu had entrusted them to inquire about information regarding second-tier alchemists for quite some time.

On a bustling street in the Outer City, Lu Xu entered a tea house. After a few detours, he stepped into a rather secluded room. In the center of the room sat a frail old woman, her face furrowed with the marks of time.

“Fellow Daoist Yuan, what news do you have about the second-tier alchemist I asked you to inquire about?” Lu Xu sat opposite the old woman and asked directly, getting straight to the point.

The old woman seemed to be slumbering. Hearing Lu Xu’s voice, she slowly opened her eyes and asked in an incredibly ancient voice, “It’s very difficult to inquire about such noble figures as second-tier alchemists.”

“However, this old woman has indeed recently obtained news of a second-tier alchemist. But before that, I must confirm something: are you truly only inquiring about such a being to seek guidance in alchemy?”

“Is that even a question? Does Fellow Daoist Yuan truly believe I intend to conspire against a second-tier alchemist?”

“Hehe, there shouldn’t be anyone in the Nine Kingdoms so audacious!” The old woman chuckled. The few second-tier alchemists in Wanxian City were all consecrated elders of the Merchant Alliance’s Hundred Herbs Pavilion. To scheme against them would be to offend the Merchant Alliance. Even Golden Core forces dared not easily offend the Merchant Alliance, let alone a Qi Condensation cultivator like Lu Xu.

“Since Fellow Daoist knows all this, why ask further? I have been stuck at an alchemy bottleneck for many years. If I relied solely on my own exploration, I don’t know when I would overcome it. That’s why I thought of finding a second-tier alchemist to guide me,” Lu Xu sighed lightly.

“If that is truly the case, then this old woman is relieved. Fellow Daoist, please don’t blame me for being so cautious. The matters involving a second-tier alchemist are simply too significant!”

“If anything were to go wrong, not only would Fellow Daoist surely die, but even this old woman’s Fengxin Pavilion might not be safe!” The old woman said with an extremely solemn expression.

“I am aware of the serious implications involved. I imagine only those tired of living would scheme against a second-tier alchemist!”

The old woman smiled and finally divulged the intelligence: “Elder Cheng of the Hundred Herbs Pavilion is recently going to open his furnace to refine a certain elixir. This elixir requires a special medicinal herb!”

“After his disciples searched the city for a while and couldn’t find this spirit herb, the Elder put out a word: if anyone helps him find this spirit herb, he will fulfill one reasonable request for that person!”

Hearing the old woman’s words, Lu Xu’s interest was immediately piqued: “May I ask what spirit herb this is?”

“It’s said to be called the Moon Orchid Flower. Since Fellow Daoist is an alchemist, you should be familiar with this spirit herb, correct?”

“So that’s it! If it’s the Moon Orchid Flower, no wonder his disciples couldn’t find this spirit herb!”

“This spirit herb grows in the Myriad Monster Mountain Range. Once plucked, no matter what preservation method is used, it cannot last more than three days. To use this herb for alchemy, it must be used within three days of being picked!”

Hearing Lu Xu recite the characteristics of this spirit herb as if enumerating his own possessions, the wary light in the old woman’s eyes finally disappeared. Only then did she truly believe that the person before her was indeed an alchemist.

“That is indeed the case. So, someone needs to enter the Myriad Monster Mountain Range to help this Elder retrieve the Moon Orchid Flower!” The old woman nodded and then added, “This news has not yet spread widely, so if Fellow Daoist wishes to consult that alchemist, you must act quickly!”

“Thank you, Fellow Daoist Yuan, for informing me of this news in advance!”

Lu Xu asked for more detailed information. After that, he stood up, left sufficient spirit stones for the old woman, and immediately turned to leave.
