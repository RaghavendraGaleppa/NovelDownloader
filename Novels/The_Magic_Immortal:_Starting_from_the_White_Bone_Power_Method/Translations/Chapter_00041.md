# Chapter 41: Thunder Seal Curse Mark

Wang Chan glanced at Ning Jingming, signaling him to go first.

After a moment of contemplation, Ning Jingming patted his storage bag and produced a jade slip, handing it over. "Ning has no need for low-grade techniques or mid-grade spells. If Fellow Daoist Qu can agree to the contents within, Ning will naturally spare no effort."

Qu Lian pressed the jade slip to her forehead. After a few breaths, she stored it away without any change in expression, simply nodding at Ning Jingming.

The tension in Ning Jingming's face eased, a faint smile appearing.

Wang Chan observed this exchange thoughtfully.

With Ning Jingming's matter settled, Qu Lian turned her attention to Wang Chan.

Without preamble, she flicked her sleeve, sending a pale green jade slip floating toward Wang Chan. Her composed demeanor suggested she had prepared this in advance.

As Wang Chan examined the jade slip, Qu Lian smiled faintly and explained, "The 'Minor Greenwood Qi Absorption Technique'—though a low-grade unorthodox method—is purely wood-attributed. The spiritual energy cultivated from it brims with vitality, and its practice is straightforward, nourishing both body and mind. Most importantly, if one can obtain a companion creature called the 'Green Origin Silkworm' to assist cultivation, it can increase the chances of forming a Dao Foundation by half a percent when the time comes."

Ning Jingming nodded approvingly beside them.

Earlier, he had sensed Wang Chan's spiritual energy as impure and weak, clearly cultivated from a non-graded technique. Considering Wang Chan's poor aptitude, more complex and profound techniques would likely be difficult to comprehend. With this method offering an increased chance of Foundation Establishment, even if it meant being at Qu Lian's mercy, Ning Jingming would have chosen it were he in Wang Chan's place.

"Could Fellow Daoist Qu disclose in advance what the mid-grade spell offered as compensation entails?" Wang Chan set the jade slip down calmly after a brief inspection, cutting straight to the point.

Both Ning Jingming and Qu Lian turned to Wang Chan in surprise.

For any cultivator, the path came first, followed by the means to protect it. A low-grade technique at least offered a chance at Foundation Establishment, whereas non-graded techniques made it impossible. Without hope for the Dao, no amount of protective power would matter—a century later, one would still be but a handful of dust.

This Fellow Daoist Wang didn't seem like a fool.

Noticing their confusion, Wang Chan flicked his sleeve. A silver needle danced in the air, guided by a stream of pure, dense gray-white spiritual energy, moving with agile grace.

"Fellow Daoist Wang's low-grade spiritual energy is remarkably refined," Ning Jingming remarked, realization dawning. His eyes brightened as he regarded Wang Chan with newfound respect.

This man had more tricks up his sleeve than expected.

Last time, his spiritual energy had clearly been non-graded. Yet now, faced with a choice, it had suddenly reached low-grade purity—astonishingly so. Ning Jingming found it hard to believe someone could refine their energy to such a degree in just a month after switching techniques. The only explanation was that Wang Chan possessed some method—be it a spell, divine ability, or artifact—to conceal or alter the nature of his spiritual energy, making it appear non-graded.

Ning Jingming had seen many with such abilities, most of them rogue cultivators. Those with established backgrounds rarely bothered unless under special circumstances. It was a necessity for the unaffiliated—without backing, one had to rely on oneself, and keeping cards close to the chest was prudent.

Had it not been for the need to exert full effort in sealing the Corpse Ghost Insect today—where hiding his capabilities would be impossible—Fellow Daoist Wang would likely have continued concealing his true strength.

"Though low-grade, this yin-attributed spiritual energy is dense and refined, not something achieved overnight. Fellow Daoist Wang has an impressive foundation," Qu Lian commented, a flicker of surprise in her eyes. With another wave of her sleeve, she sent another jade slip floating toward Wang Chan. "Please take a look, Fellow Daoist Wang."

Wang Chan took it and pressed it to his forehead.

Protection Art, Golden Armor Art, Bright Flame Sword, Wind Arrow Technique...

At a glance, Wang Chan's mind surged with excitement.

The jade slip contained brief introductions to nine mid-grade spells!

Just who was this Fellow Daoist Qu?

Nine mid-grade spell legacies—such wealth wasn't something even established Qi Refining families or weaker Foundation Establishment clans could boast. The adage "the Dao is not lightly shared" held true in the cultivation world. While one might amass enough spirit coins to buy mid-grade artifacts, or even luck into an auction to acquire high-grade ones (if daring enough to risk being robbed), mid-grade spells were rarely available through normal channels, let alone auctions.

Typically, such legacies were guarded within forbidden areas of major factions, protected by layers of restrictions, not carried around by individuals.

Could Fellow Daoist Qu be...?

Wang Chan studied Qu Lian briefly before shaking his head and returning the jade slip. "None meet my needs."

If Ning Jingming could negotiate, so could he.

Though any of these mid-grade spells would normally be beyond Wang Chan's reach, he preferred quality over quantity. Most were common offensive or defensive spells, lacking even a movement technique. With only two spell slots remaining in his current state, he had to be selective.

With "Dragon's Vigor, Tiger's Ferocity" at his disposal, ordinary offensive and defensive spells held little appeal.

Qu Lian observed Wang Chan quietly, as if trying to see through him.

Wang Chan met her gaze with equal calm, a faint smile on his lips.

For a moment, the two locked eyes—one strikingly handsome, the other pristine as spring—appearing almost like a match made in heaven.

Ning Jingming, sitting to the side, felt oddly out of place, an urge to leave creeping up on him.

Setting aside Ning Jingming's discomfort, Qu Lian pondered.

Had Wang Chan not displayed his exceptionally refined yin-attributed spiritual energy, she might have assumed he was merely angling for better terms. But now, she suspected Wang Chan might have his own legacies, with aptitude and comprehension surpassing expectations. Perhaps he genuinely wouldn't risk his life against the Corpse Ghost Insect for ordinary mid-grade spells.

Yet cultivators skilled in "yin-evil sealing" were rare, and her own condition couldn't afford further delay. Judging by Wang Chan's demeanor, further haggling might lead to a deadlock. With a slight frown, she decisively retrieved an ancient-looking jade slip from her storage bag and handed it to Wang Chan. "It seems ordinary spells don't interest Fellow Daoist Wang. If you seek something more formidable, take a look at these."

In truth, all spells and divine abilities had their merits. Their potency often depended more on the wielder than the technique itself. Yet some spells were rarer, more unique—either more powerful in certain aspects, possessing combined restrictions with versatile applications, or simply harder to counter.

Wang Chan took the ancient jade slip and immersed his consciousness within.

"Water-Fire Escape Art."

"Dragon-Tiger Seizing Hand."

"Thunder Seal Curse Mark."

Only three mid-grade spells were recorded, but their descriptions stirred his interest.

The Water-Fire Escape Art, once mastered, allowed the use of the renowned Water and Fire Escape Techniques—exceptional for fleeing or survival.

Dragon-Tiger Seizing Hand was a powerful grasping-type offensive spell.

The Thunder Seal Curse Mark was a lightning-attributed sealing technique.

Unlike the "Nine Needles Seal" or other sealing arts, this curse mark could persist for extended periods once cast. If its power waned, additional applications could reinforce it. Moreover, the Thunder Seal Curse Mark excelled at suppressing yin-evil forces.

However, the technique required lightning-attributed energy as a catalyst—conveniently, Wang Chan's white needles contained thunderwood essence.

"The first and third spells," Wang Chan stated without hesitation, choosing two.
