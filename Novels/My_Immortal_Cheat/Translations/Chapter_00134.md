# Chapter 134: A Pack of Wolves Hunting a Tiger

"Mm."

Zhou Changsheng nodded. His status was very high; let alone Mu Su and Ling Yu, even lower-ranking Zhou family members rarely got to see him. If not for Zhou Tian's sake, the two of them wouldn't even be qualified to see the corner of Zhou Changsheng's clothes.

Nodding towards Zhou Tian, the two walked out under the guidance of a servant. This place was the core area of the Zhou family's stronghold, dense with formations. A single misstep could lead to one's bones being crushed.

"Come, sit down."

Zhou Changsheng beckoned to Zhou Tian. He had now reined in his imposing aura, appearing like an ordinary middle-aged man, devoid of that profound, prison-like feeling.

Zhou Tian walked forward. For some reason, despite being able to talk circles around even the Saint Devil, he now felt a hint of restraint in his heart. He couldn't quite understand why.

"Don't treat me as an outsider. I'm away all year and rarely return, so you might not be very familiar with me, but there's no need to be nervous."

Zhou Changsheng had lived for countless years and knew countless people. He naturally saw Zhou Tian's unnatural demeanor and offered comfort.

Zhou Tian nodded, unsure what to say. He couldn't very well rush forward, hug Zhou Changsheng's thigh, and weep profusely, could he?

Zhou Changsheng didn't dwell on this topic, as it wasn't something to be resolved in a day. He changed the subject and asked, "Although that old fellow, the Saint Devil, seems crazy, he's quite calculating. I wonder with whom he struck a deal to suddenly attack my Zhou family. In recent years, his movements in the Star Realm have suddenly become very active, and now he has even returned to the Nine Provinces. He must be plotting something significant."

"Grandfather, on the way he brought me here..."

Zhou Tian told Zhou Changsheng some of the information he had obtained from the Saint Devil.

Zhou Changsheng listened carefully, then nodded and said, "He's right. He obtained the inheritance of an ancient Buddha named Wutian Buddha Ancestor from the Ancient Buddhist Realm. Buddha and Devil are one, incredibly bizarre, but no one knows the specifics."

Wutian? And Buddha Ancestor? That monastic name sounds truly Buddhist. Zhou Tian was stunned, then heard Zhou Changsheng continue, "But I didn't expect the one who made a deal with him might be an ancient deity from the God Realm. Tsk tsk... It seems Wutian Buddha's relic fell into the hands of the God Realm. Interesting..."

Zhou Changsheng thought of many things. He wasn't angry that the Saint Devil had made a deal with someone from the God Realm. The Saint Devil had deliberately revealed a lot of information to Zhou Tian precisely because he wanted to convey these messages to Zhou Changsheng. The Saint Devil simply wanted to express a certain attitude, which Zhou Changsheng naturally understood.

Zhou Tian looked at his grandfather, who was deep in thought, feeling a little confused. He didn't know what his grandfather was thinking, and after a moment, he asked, "Grandfather, what exactly is the situation in this God-Abandoned Land? Why are only three of you suppressing it here?"

The information Zhou Tian got from Ling Yu's mother made him realize that the schemes of those ancient deities from the God Realm were probably astonishingly vast. Zhou Changsheng and the few others alone could definitely not cope with everything that was about to happen.

"That's a long story, involving many forces, secret histories, and a series of conspiracies surrounding a newly discovered world."

Zhou Changsheng's eyes were distant; this seemed to be a big secret.

Zhou Tian perked up his ears, ready to listen carefully.

"It's just that we're short-handed."

That's it? Zhou Tian looked dumbfounded. Was this the big secret involving many conspiracies?

"Haha."

Zhou Changsheng burst into laughter upon seeing Zhou Tian's bewildered expression.

Zhou Tian looked helpless. These elderly people inexplicably had some strange quirks, but Zhou Changsheng was much better than the Saint Devil, at least not as perverse.

"Don't underestimate that sentence."

Zhou Changsheng reined in his smile. "Our major forces have accumulated for countless years, with countless capable experts. For us to be short-handed, the situation is already extremely critical."

"This newly discovered world is a super-large world. Its terrifying depth is no less than any of the Ancient Nine Realms. It's simply a massive quagmire, constantly pulling our people in. Even several ancestors have been tied down. If it weren't for the fact that their realm is also in a state of great tribulation, the situation would probably be even more critical."

Zhou Tian was a little surprised. He now had some understanding of the Ancient Nine Realms and knew how powerful those worlds were. He didn't expect the newly discovered world to have such deep foundations. To say it was no weaker than the Nine Realms meant it was stronger than one of the Nine Realms.

"If I hadn't temporarily returned to the Nine Provinces because of the Saint Devil's actions, I might have been implicated as well."

"With the help of the World Consciousness, their combat strength within their own world is almost a realm higher than ours."

"Furthermore, many forces in the Star Realm are eyeing us covetously. Those that have already revealed themselves include Starry Sky Workshop, Heavenly God Mountain, and Abyss Tomb, not to mention those hidden forces."

Zhou Tian felt his head swelling. Why was the script becoming increasingly wrong? Hearing Zhou Changsheng say this, it felt like there were so many enemies.

Starry Sky Workshop, Heavenly God Mountain, Abyss Tomb—these forces sounded incredibly powerful just by their names. Those mentioned by Zhou Changsheng must be on par with their own family.

"Why does it feel like we have so many enemies?"

Zhou Tian forced a bitter smile. The Zhou family had given him a sense of belonging, and he had many lovely friends here. He truly didn't want anything to happen to the Zhou family.

"Enemies? They don't have any feud with us. We even ordered a batch of goods from Starry Sky Workshop a few years ago. How can they be considered enemies? It's merely a matter of interests."

Zhou Changsheng sighed. "Our Nine Provinces are composed of eight major forces. Any one of these eight forces, if taken out, would have a name in the Star Realm, let alone when we unite. Although we have many internal conflicts, generally speaking, we are united against external threats, and many forces consider us a thorn in their side."

Zhou Tian scratched his head comically. He felt as if it would have been better to transmigrate into an ordinary person. Now, the enemies he faced were terrifying existences.

"Of course, don't worry. We're not universally hated. We still have allies in the Star Realm, such as Sword Domain and Falling Wind Pavilion. Although Falling Wind Pavilion had quite a few complaints about us because of your mother's matter back then, they wouldn't stand idly by. The situation hasn't reached an irremediable point."

Zhou Changsheng said, fearing Zhou Tian might feel pressured, but his tone was a little unnatural when he mentioned Falling Wind Pavilion.

Zhou Tian's heart stirred. His mother? He suddenly remembered that the mother of this body seemed to have been harmed and died during childbirth. When he first learned of this, he found it strange—who would dare to pluck the tiger's whiskers of the Zhou family? But as time passed, he had somewhat forgotten, as he had never lived with her and had no concrete impression.
