Chapter 223: The Real and Fake Ying Bing, Does She Want to Be the First to Experience "Dead Dad"?

Not far from the painted boat pavilion, in a courtyard.

Inside a room, a woman dressed exactly like Ying Bing, with a figure eight-tenths similar, was applying her makeup. She stood up, examining her face in the mirror, while the madam adjusted her makeup and hair according to a portrait.

"If Ying Bing stood right in front of you, I'm afraid she wouldn't be able to tell the difference either."

"It's still lacking a bit of charm."

Yin Mianmian was currently operating the Heavenly Demon Transformation Form. In the past, when she mimicked others, she could fool even their own siblings. However, when mimicking Ying Bing, she was always missing three-tenths of that charm. That peerless, cold, and enchanting immortal aura was impossible to learn.

The madam wiped the sweat from her forehead. "Heh, she's cold and icy, but how could she compare to Your Ladyship's天生媚骨? When that bloodthirsty, half-grown greenhorn Li Mo sees you, he'll be so captivated by your beauty that he won't have the mind to scrutinize you closely."

"That makes sense."

Yin Mianmian let out a soft laugh and spun in front of the mirror. She felt that even she couldn't distinguish the real from the fake at a glance, but she still asked, "How is it? Is there anywhere that looks off?"

"Well..."

The madam had been about to say no, because from the front, there really wasn't. But as the saying goes, "Viewed from the side, it becomes a ridge; viewed from the front, it becomes a peak." The word "side" is very important. So, as soon as Yin Mianmian turned around, the difference became quite obvious.

"Hm?"

Yin Mianmian lowered her gaze. She had discovered two shortcomings.

"....."

The image of the少年 (young man) shattering the aura of her Heavenly Demon Illusion with just a few words flashed through Yin Mianmian's mind.

*Creak—*

Yin Mianmian's beautiful face darkened, her hand clenching with a cracking sound.

The madam knelt down in terror, repeatedly saying, "You... you look even more like her now..."

A moment later.

The door opened. Outside stood several嫡系 (direct disciples) of the Divine Observing Realm, led by a cold-faced man. The moment they saw the person walking out of the room, their bodies tensed up as if facing a great enemy.

"How could Ying Bing be here?"

The assassins drew their weapons in shock and suspicion, including the cold-faced man.

"Heh, have you all gone stupid?"

Seeing that even these elite assassins couldn't tell the difference, 'Ying Bing' couldn't help but smile with satisfaction. The cold-faced man was also a ranked figure on the Hidden Dragon List, someone she had paid a high price to hire.

She continued, "Proceed according to the plan, everyone, move out."

"Yes."

"By the way, I haven't eaten dinner yet. I just bought two steamed buns, but I can't find them."

"What's the big deal if you skip a meal?"

"Following the Saintess, are you afraid you won't get a late-night snack?"

...

In a tavern by the Yulong Lake.

Ying Bing sat cross-legged on the roof. Before her floated a blood-colored essence, pulsing like a beating heart, exuding a thick vitality. The light surged, casting a shimmering glow on the girl's jade-like face.

The Blood Phoenix Essence would temper the physical body imperceptibly. Of course, this was not its greatest use; it was that it stored vitality during cultivation, increasing the power of secret techniques. Furthermore, upon reaching the Inner Scenery Realm, severed limbs could regenerate. In the Outer Scenery Realm, one no longer feared fatal injuries, and the Dharma Body could even regenerate from a single drop of blood. As for reaching the Profound Mystery Realm, as long as the Blood Phoenix Essence existed, one would be immortal.

Sensing the resonance between the Blood Phoenix Essence and the Scarlet Phoenix Qi, Ying Bing felt a little more at ease. Her breath and the subsequent strength of her physical body were something no one in the same realm could match. As she naturally thought this, the silhouette of a certain Li student hammering open the sky involuntarily surfaced in her mind. Was it truly unmatched? And... he had been tinkering with something every night recently. The lid of the cauldron had flown off several times. Every time they practiced dual cultivation, he was covered in the strange fragrance of elixirs.

"I must adjust myself to my best state before the midnight hour..."

Ying Bing stopped connecting the Blood Phoenix Essence and the Scarlet Phoenix Qi, storing them in her brow, and closed her eyes to adjust her spirit.

Not long after.

*Swish—*

She suddenly opened her eyes. With a light wave of her five fingers, she caught a hidden arrow that was about to pierce the wall behind her. There was a letter tied to the arrow.

*"[I am Baili Rang. Having heard that Ying Fairy's swordsmanship is exquisite, I humbly request a challenge at the heart of Yulong Lake.]"*

The 51st on the Hidden Dragon List? Ying Bing didn't have a deep impression of this person. She vaguely recalled he was a bounty hunter, a "captured blade" as they are often called in the jianghu. Since the Hidden Dragon List was announced, quite a few people had found their way to the tavern. Most of them were there to propose marriage to Li Mo. Of course, there was also a small portion who came to challenge him. If they could defeat a top-tier prodigy on the Hidden Dragon List, they could become famous overnight. The top-tier ones were either in the ninth or eighth level of the Observing God Realm, or they were of noble birth, or disciples of major sects, or at worst, sole heirs of hidden sects. Li Mo, who was younger and at a lower realm, was a more suitable target for them than Ying Bing.

"Defeating a mid-tier figure on the Hidden Dragon List should reduce the number of miscellaneous people coming to the door in the future."

After a moment of thought—

---

Ying Bing carried Tian Shuang and went downstairs. On the way, she passed the third floor. From a spacious, top-class room, there was a clattering sound.

"Junior Sister Bing, where are you going?"

Tang Xiaobao came upstairs carrying some wood.

Ying Bing said indifferently, "Someone is challenging me."

"That's a pity."

Tang Xiaobao looked regretful. "Our 'Supreme Micro-Love Private Room' is about to be decorated. Senior Brother Li would definitely want you to be the first to experience it."

"Supreme... Micro-Love... Private Room?"

Ying Bing's eyes filled with confusion. Junior Brother Li occasionally gave things strange names, like the "Happy Goat Hot Pot Shop."

"What kind of... experience is this room for?"

"Dead Dad."

"?"

"It's a massage, I don't know why Junior Brother Li calls it Dead Dad..."

Tang Xiaobao scratched the back of his head. Junior Sister Bing and Junior Brother Li interacted a lot; maybe she would know the meaning behind Junior Brother Li's name. But just as he was about to ask, he looked up to see that Ying Bing had already gone downstairs. Her steps seemed... a bit faster than before?

Tang Xiaobao blinked in confusion and carried the wood into the room. The room had been completely renovated. In the originally luxurious private room, there was now a reclining massage chair and many candlesticks with colored glass covers. Junior Brother Li was holding a small hammer, nailing in nails while muttering to himself.

"Forty... forty..."

"Junior Brother Li, why do you shout 'forty' every time you hammer?"

"It's the hammer's name. It gives me more strength to shout while I work."

"Oh, oh, I remember now. Junior Brother, don't you have another one called 'Eighty'? Why don't you use it? Wouldn't that give you even more strength?"

As Tang Xiaobao said this, the Panjie Meteor Hammer in the World Seed began to vibrate excitedly. The Hammer Baby wanted to hit something. That's right, why not use it?

"...... This project is small. We'll use it when we have a big project later."

Li Mo's words answered Tang Xiaobao while also comforting the Hammer Baby. The Hammer Baby was thus very happy and began to look forward to the future big projects.

"Junior Brother Li, why are the candle covers this color?"

"This is called an atmosphere light."

Li Mo explained, but he estimated that Senior Brother Xiaobao probably wouldn't understand.

"What about the bottle next to it?"

Tang Xiaobao was full of curiosity.

"That's called a fragrance. A good scent can relax the mind. I'm still thinking about what kind of perfume to put in it... I wonder if Old Xue knows how to make fragrance pills..."

Li Mo took the new wood and muttered.

Tang Xiaobao thought for a moment and puffed out his chest. "That's easy! Just use my bathwater!"

"Hiss..."

Master Li was stunned, suddenly realizing. That's right. Who could be more fragrant than Senior Brother Xiaobao? But to be honest, if it were for drinking, compared to elixirs that prolong life, everyone would definitely prefer to drink the water from the Misty Flower Unaging Spring...

"Then I'll go take a bath."

Tang Xiaobao happily left the room. As he was going downstairs, a woman suddenly walked up towards him.

"Junior Sister Bing?"

Senior Brother Xiaobao was completely bewildered. "Weren't you just going out? You're back so soon?"

That's right. The woman walking up the stairs was 'Ying Bing'.

"Where is Li Mo?"

'Ying Bing' asked.

"Oh, he's decorating on the third floor..."

Hearing this, 'Ying Bing' nodded lightly and walked towards the room on the third floor.

Tang Xiaobao was a bit confused. Junior Sister Bing came back way too fast, even faster than using the latrine. She's really amazing. It's just that her memory is a bit bad.明明 he said Junior Brother Li was on the third floor decorating, and Junior Sister Bing forgot as soon as she turned around.

*Hmmmm*

As Tang Xiaobao thought about it, a light of wisdom suddenly flashed in his eyes; the new窍 (hole) he had just opened was working.

"Is there a possibility!"

"That Junior Sister Bing rushed back so fast because she wanted to be the first to experience Dead Dad?"

"She's just too embarrassed, so she pretended not to know and asked again."

"That's it, I'm so smart."

Tang Xiaobao felt that people wouldn't call him simple-minded anymore.
