# Chapter 655: This Time, We Both Prove the Golden Core

A grand and sacred will, far more immense than the Cangming Dao Fruit, as if encompassing the nine heavens and all realms, eternal and indestructible, descended violently.

Brilliant thunder Dao patterns materialized in the firmament, like a thunderous star hanging in the boundless sky, radiating pressure that made all the Foundation Establishment true cultivators present feel insignificant and breathless, as well as an ultimate temptation.

"Dao Fruit Manifestation!"

Within the Primordial Origin Sect, a Foundation Establishment true cultivator murmured, gazing at the Dao Fruit manifested between heaven and earth with burning heat.

Heaven and earth trembled violently.

The spiritual energy of the entire Taihua Spirit Ruin World churned.

From the Wansheng Sword Sect and the Bodhisattva Pure Land, separated by hundreds of millions of miles, two forces of Dao Fruit bestowal, representing the ultimate extremes of completely different Great Daos, were forcibly summoned by two individuals at the same time.

Among the mountains of the Wansheng Sword Sect, sword hums were like a tsunami.

Countless gazes, filled with shock, fanaticism, and greed, were fixed on the figure shrouded in the shadow of the Cangming Abyss atop the Tianquan Peak.

The aura of the Imperial Sun No-Return Wansheng Dao Fruit was stirred by the homologous Cangming Dao Fruit, resonating from afar.

Tianji Xuan Shu Sword Soul Profound True Lord sensed this and couldn't help but open his eyes in astonishment.

His proven Dao Fruit belonged to the extreme Yang, while this Cangming Dao Fruit was of the extreme Yin, inherently incompatible with him.

However, if Yin and Yang could converge, it might be possible to achieve Dragon-Tiger harmony and prove the mid-stage Golden Core.

With this thought, the Profound True Lord couldn't help but stand up, his eyes flickering.

The mid-stage Golden Core meant that his personal grotto-heaven could be raised high without falling, thus achieving true immortality.

"Is it Han Shi?! He is actually seeking the Golden Core and proving the Dao at this time? He has summoned the Cangming Nine Abyss Dao Fruit!"

On Tianji Peak, an elder exclaimed in shock.

"No! This sword intent is even stronger and more domineering!"

Those with keen perception of sword intent detected something amiss.

Although it was rooted in the same source as Han Shi's furious killing sword intent, it was nearly perfect and flawless, leaving no openings to be found.

"Who would have thought Han Shi concealed himself so deeply. No wonder he dared to prove the Golden Core fruit position on his own."

A disciple of the Wansheng Sword Sect couldn't help but feel a mix of envy, jealousy, and hatred.

This person's talent was unparalleled, reaching the late stage of Foundation Establishment in less than a century, and now he is pressing on to prove the Golden Core realm.

He could truly be called a heaven-sent prodigy.

At the peak of the Pure Yang Peak, a gaze pierced through the void and fell upon Han Shi, profound and inscrutable.

The seated Pure Yang Ancestor rested his hands on his knees, his fingers slowly tapping. After pondering for a long time, he finally raised his eyes, piercing through a hundred miles to look at the Profound True Lord who couldn't help but shift his foot a single step.

The Profound True Lord felt a chill in his heart and forcefully suppressed the impulse.

All his thoughts and ideas had to be abandoned.

That's right, that Han Shi was a disciple of Lu Chunyang.

In the East Wasteland, beneath the sacred tree of the ritual to receive the Sovereign King Buddha's fruit position, the face of the Hui Ri Bodhisattva, usually as calm as an ancient well, showed its first crack.

He abruptly looked up towards the oppressive purple-gold thundercloud and the indestructible imagery of annihilation within it. His eyes erupted with Buddhist light, filled with fury and disbelief.

"Divine Thunder Dao Fruit?! Xu Yunfan! It's that junior from the Primordial Origin Sect! How dare he! How could he summon this Dao Fruit here and now!"

The Hui Ri Bodhisattva's enraged voice, amplified by Buddhist power, echoed through heaven and earth.

He had laid out this King Buddha ritual, expending countless efforts, and was about to achieve success in one go, pushing the fortune of the Bodhisattva Pure Land to its peak, only to have its spiritual momentum abruptly cut off at this moment, disrupted by the bestowal of another Supreme Dao Fruit.

This was not only a disruption of the ritual but also a severe provocation to the Bodhisattva Pure Land and to him, the Hui Ri Bodhisattva.

More importantly, this Sovereign King Buddha fruit position was related to his step into the late stage of Golden Core, so it could not afford the slightest mistake.

After all, he was a figure of the mid-stage Golden Core.

The Vajra Guardian Array, struck by the sudden pressure of the thunder, fell into a slight chaos.

Countless Buddhist cultivators looked in horror towards the core of the thundercloud. The aura of the figure seated in the ruins of the mountain range was clearly only at the late stage of Foundation Establishment, yet it felt like a thunderous volcano on the verge of eruption.

"Presumptuous child!"

The Hui Ri Bodhisattva roared, a golden Buddha palm covering the sky, shrouded in immense Buddhist power and the nascent might of the King Buddha fruit position.

Carrying a terrifying will to suppress all demons and purify all laws, it slammed down towards the ruins of the mountain range where Xu Yunfan's true body was located.

He wanted to crush this daring junior from the Primordial Origin Sect, along with his delusion of receiving a Dao Fruit, into dust.

Obstructing someone's path of cultivation is ten thousand times more vicious than killing their parents.

The Hui Ri Bodhisattva wished to tear Xu Yunfan to pieces.

This bastard actually came all the way to the East Wasteland to summon a Dao Fruit.

On the other side, in the direction of the Wansheng Sword Sect, several overwhelmingly powerful sword intents also soared into the sky, filled with scrutiny and sharpness, locking onto Han Shi who was summoning the Cangming Dao Fruit atop a certain peak.

Among them, one sword intent was as magnificent as the great sun, extreme Yang and extreme Yang, the most terrifying. It belonged to the Pure Yang Ancestor Lu Chunyang, making these people somewhat wary.

"The Cangming Dao Fruit... This child's sword intent has actually reached such a perfect and flawless state. This is not something a human can do. It's likely not Han Shi's own intention. Let me capture him and see!"

Within the Wansheng Sword Sect, a swordsmanship family, displeased, couldn't help but take action.

There were a thousand reasons, but one would surely suffice to interrupt Han Shi's proof of the Golden Core.

Just kidding, his family still had a Foundation Establishment cultivator waiting to be nurtured. How could they let this country bumpkin take the spot.

One Lu Chunyang was enough; it would be impolite to have another.

An elder of the Tian Shu Peak let out a cold shout. A chilling sword light, powerful enough to split seas and sever mountains, was already being prepared, intending to strike Han Shi, forcibly restrain him, and interrupt his proof.

Sensing this, the clone, which had borrowed Han Shi's emotions to fuel its own rage, opened its bloodshot, crimson-red eyes under Xu Yunfan's control.

It slightly flickered the longsword in its hand, and at the tip of the blade, an extremely brilliant sword intent shot out instantly, obliterating that sword light.

"Old dog, once I prove the Golden Core, you will be the first I slay."

Han Shi, or rather Xu Yunfan, looked coldly at the Tian Shu Peak elder who had drawn his sword.

The elder's face turned green and white.

However, since he had already made a move, he would not hesitate further. He immediately charged towards Han Shi, who was manifesting his fruit position.

The Golden Core True Lords within the sect were suppressed by Lu Chunyang and did not dare to act. These Foundation Establishment cultivators, however, had no such scruples.

Faced with these changes, Xu Yunfan did not panic in the slightest. This time was indeed like dancing on the edge of a blade, but he naturally had a foolproof plan, in case it truly did not work.

Xu Yunfan's mind turned inward, looking at the Moon Wheel Treasure Mirror within his body.

If it came to that, he would simply leave the Taihua Spirit Ruin World, achieve the External Path Golden Core True Lord with this Dao Fruit, and then return to find a way to prove the proper path.

In this way...

Xu Yunfan, who had summoned the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit, moved his fingers slightly. In the center of the East Wasteland, Wukong, who was seated in the middle of the ritual, trembled slightly.

Wukong opened his eyes, filled with astonishment.

"Eh, so I am actually someone else's clone?"

Feeling the command下达 from Xu Yunfan, Wukong fell silent for a moment, then slowly stood up, holding his staff.

As Wukong's body trembled slightly, the golden, boiling Buddhist light deep within his sea of consciousness suddenly went out of control.

The true words of the "Great Majesty Ming King Battle Buddha Sutra" flowed in reverse from the stone fetus's origin, and every Sanskrit character ignited with dark golden battle flames.
