Chapter 164

The Phoenix came in from outside. Originally, she had been staying in her true form on the rooftop of this building, but feeling the Saint Demon’s summons, she transformed into human form and descended. The Tongtian Building had no restrictions on this; as long as you had money, it wasn’t impossible for the Tongtian Company to even clear a special path for you to maintain your original size.

Other mounted fierce beasts weren’t unable to transform into human form either. However, figures from truly powerful factions distinguished this very clearly: mounts were mounts, and they wouldn’t allow them to follow. This was about their dignity.

Only a miserable wretch like Saint Demon, having spent so many years out in the world, had so little to his name and no extra people to use.

The Phoenix's jade pendants jingled as she moved, her vintage long dress trailing on the ground. Her face was fair and delicate, her eyes sparkled with light, and her dark hair cascaded like a waterfall. The ornaments in her hair swayed and gleamed, her whole being graceful and well-rounded, exuding elegance and nobility.

This time, having transformed into human form, her appearance was largely different from last time, except for her face, which remained the same. This made Zhou Tian’s expression turn strange.

*This old pervert Saint Demon, could it be that he occasionally makes Phoenix play dress-up games, hmm? Tsk, tsk. This then raises a question: when it comes to the ultimate pleasure, is it the personality controlling the body that enjoys it, or both personalities simultaneously? What if one personality toiled for a long time, and at the very last moment, another personality suddenly popped out to reap the rewards? Tsk, tsk.*

“For this period, you will follow him.” Saint Demon instructed Phoenix.

“Yes, Master.” Phoenix bowed slightly in response.

Zhou Tian massaged his brow. He didn’t know why, but hearing the title “Master” felt very strange to him.

Saint Demon closed his eyes, no longer paying attention to Zhou Tian. He still had many things to prepare; the Heavenly Venerate's Tomb wasn't so easy to enter.

Seeing this, Zhou Tian turned and left the room. This building not only looked enormous, but its internal space was far larger than it appeared on the outside. Some kind of formation array was used.

Movement between floors relied on something similar to an elevator; it functioned like an elevator, but was, in reality, a white space.

“Huh, why is the six hundred and seventy-second floor still lit?”

Entering the elevator, Zhou Tian noticed it used the same formation array as the rooftop corridor, so no one else was crowding into the same elevator with him. He was slightly surprised by one of the floor buttons, as it was faintly glowing.

Phoenix didn't speak. She also didn't know why.

Zhou Tian had only said it casually, not expecting an answer. He instinctively tapped it, finding no reaction. He couldn't go there.

He shrugged and pressed the button for the first floor. With a slight tremor, the door opened. Instantly, they arrived on the first floor.

Stepping out of this space, the first-floor lobby was also a magnificent and grand space, resplendent with gold and jade. The rooftop passage was not accessible to ordinary people; only those with membership cards, like Saint Demon, were qualified to pass through. Ordinary people could only enter via the lobby.

The Tongtian Hotel had suites specifically designed for powerful cultivators, and also rooms prepared for ordinary cultivators.

Coincidentally, as soon as he came out, Zhou Tian saw several familiar faces.

“Young Master Chen, please come this way. The banquet is on the six hundred and seventy-second floor.”

A young man, fawning, escorted another young man into the lobby. Behind them followed two young women, meek and subservient.

It was precisely the group of master and servants Zhou Tian had met in the teleportation plaza. However, at this moment, that young master no longer had his arrogant demeanor; he was accompanying the other person.

That person had an elegant bearing. He was dressed in formal attire, similar to a suit. His shirt was pristine white, spotless. A faint smile hung on his face, and his whole being appeared refined and transcendent.

They didn't avoid anyone when speaking, so Zhou Tian heard everything clearly. His heart stirred slightly. *Six hundred and seventy-second floor? So someone's holding a banquet.*

The lobby didn't use that special formation array; after all, the target audience was different. Many people, upon seeing this group, instinctively moved out of the way, not daring to provoke them.

That group walked straight over. Since Zhou Tian and Phoenix had just come down from the elevator, and the other party was heading towards the elevator, they almost ran into each other head-on. The young man in the suit stopped and seemed to say something to the fawning young man. The fawning young man frowned slightly, walked up to Zhou Tian and Phoenix, and spoke:

“Excuse me, could the two of you please move aside?”

Looking at Zhou Tian's attire, his eyes held a hint of disdain. It was the Phoenix behind him that slightly surprised him with her beauty.

At this time, Zhou Tian had already changed his appearance, and the young man hadn't seen Phoenix's human form before. Thus, he didn't recognize Zhou Tian as the one who had embarrassed him that day in the teleportation plaza.

Zhou Tian glanced left, then right, finally confirming that the person was speaking to him. He couldn’t help but say helplessly, “You’re still *so* far from us, why do we *have* to make way for you?”

He was speechless. In reality, although Zhou Tian and Phoenix were in front of them, they weren't directly in their path. Even if neither side moved, they wouldn't collide.

“A bootlicker will lose everything in the end. I hope you understand that.” Zhou Tian said earnestly.

“You…” Annoyance appeared on that person’s face. “Friend, the one behind me is a shareholder of Tongtian Company, Young Master Chen of the Chen family. I hope you’ll think carefully.”

An arrogant expression appeared on that person’s face, as if *he* was the Tongtian Company shareholder, not the Chen family.

“Oh.” Zhou Tian stroked his slightly prickly full beard. “Do you know who I am?”

That person was slightly startled. He sized up Zhou Tian from top to bottom. Dressed ordinarily, with a full beard, incredibly ugly, without an ounce of noble temperament. Only the Phoenix behind him exuded a sense of elegance and nobility. *Could it be that he really had some extraordinary background?*

“Remember my name, I am Mu Su!” Zhou Tian said resonantly.

That person thought for a long time but found no records about this name.

“Li Yuan, what’s going on?” Young Master Chen stepped forward. His brow was slightly furrowed. Having been delayed for so long, he was already growing a bit impatient.

Even when he saw Zhou Tian’s face, he was slightly surprised. Because with an increase in strength, one could subtly adjust one's body and remove major flaws. An unconventional face like Zhou Tian's hadn't been seen for a long time.

“Young Master Chen, these two friends don’t seem to take your status seriously.” Li Yuan whispered.

“Is that so? You two…” Young Master Chen turned his head to face Zhou Tian. His eyes narrowed slightly, glinting with a dangerous light.

“Is your family a shareholder of Tongtian Company?” Zhou Tian asked.

“That’s right.” Young Master Chen said proudly. Although his family was only a minor shareholder, they were still shareholders. This status was enough for him to look down on many people.

“Then why don’t you use the rooftop passage?” Zhou Tian reached out and pointed upwards.
