# Chapter 310: Li Mo, I Forgot Something

Li Mo picked up the spiritual herbs and treasures, placing them into the hollowed-out wooden tub carved from a tree root. He then shouted outside for the innkeeper to prepare hot water.

Soon, the room was filled with swirling steam and the sweet, fragrant scent of flowers and herbs.

Li Mo tested the water temperature in the tub floating with flower petals. Finding it comparable to the Fog Flower Unaging Spring, he looked to the side.

"Ice Cube, the soup is ready. Come on in."

Ying Bing pressed her lips together, her beautiful eyes filled with a complex, indescribable emotion.

"Is this today's 'four dishes and one soup'?"

"Huh?"

Li Mo was taken aback.

He really hadn't made any soup for dinner; he had returned late and was quite tired. Besides, this "soup" wasn't meant for drinking...

"In the South, they call hot springs 'tang' (soup). Oh, you didn't think..."

"I didn't."

Ying Bing looked at him coldly.

"...Right."

Li Mo had intended to explain, but in the silence, he remembered the scenery he had witnessed during her last massage.

It was well known that Li Mo possessed an incredibly formidable physique, capable of withstanding the force of four thousand soldiers and beating down disaster beasts. However, there were some things that even an indestructible diamond body couldn't protect against.

They could make him bleed in an instant.

That could be fatal.

If he were honest with himself, Li Mo considered himself a gentleman, but if he were to scoop a bowl of water from the tub she had just bathed in, he was afraid his mouth might have a mind of its own.

Li Mo said seriously, "Go ahead and soak. The soup will get cold soon, and it won't be...嗯, it won't be comfortable to soak in if it's cold."

Ying Bing pinched the big-headed doll, her tone profound. "Young Hero Li, you are truly a gentleman..."

"Of course, I am."

Li Mo's face was the picture of seriousness.

*Swish—*

A wisp of rosy light appeared, transforming into a small hand that pulled over the screen, dividing the room in two. One side became a temporary bathhouse.

"?"

Young Master Li's expression stiffened.

Wait, even a gentleman needs to be guarded against?

So, the most beautiful scenery in the world might be separated from you by just a single screen. She was inside, and he was outside.

The night pearls illuminated the entire room, their light softer and brighter than candlelight, making the woven screen appear pure and flawless, like a blank canvas.

The girl's exquisite silhouette was cast upon it, giving shape to the beautiful interplay of light and shadow, stirring one's heart.

A rustling sound began to echo.

"Hm? What's that sound?"

Young Master Li, the gentleman, sat at the table, analyzing the situation with a serious and calm demeanor.

Yes, that must be the sound of taking off silk stockings...

Young Master Li took a deep breath and fiercely pinched his own waist.

The system had given him so many rewards today, and he hadn't had a chance to claim them and take a proper inventory!

Seventy-Two Transformations was now complete; it was time to contemplate the Somersault Cloud from the *Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao*!

Li Mo, Li Mo, how could you sink so low!

"Can't let my head get clouded by other thoughts!"

He summoned the system, took a deep breath, and looked at the long list of rewards.

**[Investment Feedback: 10 Yuan Army Crossbows.]**

**[Yuan Army Seven-Killing Crossbow:** Early on, the master craftsman Gongsun Buqi created this. It can be infused with True Essence, possessing immense piercing power. It is difficult to block even with the domain of an Inner Scene expert, making it a true killer weapon among military armaments.**]**

"Military armaments?"

Li Mo's eyes widened slightly in surprise.

Although this item was precious, it obviously couldn't be compared to what he'd gained from Ying Bing or Princess Jiang. However, he had never received such a feedback before, and he had rarely even seen such items.

The Great Yu Empire did not prohibit swords, blades, or even bows and armor. Sects were even allowed to maintain private armies. However, whoever secretly possessed military killer weapons was considered a rebel.

That was why he had never seen anything similar in the Hengtong Commerce Guild in Yunzhou.

This Yuan Army Seven-Killing Crossbow was a bronze-colored, murderously cold bed crossbow, clearly falling into that prohibited category.

**[Investment Feedback: 50 boxes of Thunderfire Thunder Pills.]**

**[Thunderfire Thunder Pill]:** "A genius alchemist with a unique talent. No matter what kind of pill he tried to refine, not only was it very easy for his cauldron to explode, but the power of the explosion was also extraordinary. It turned out that there was a flaw in the root bone test when he joined the sect. He did not possess a Fire-Wood root bone, but a Fire-Thunder root bone.

He was subjected to endless ridicule and humiliation within the sect, and in a fit of rage, he joined the Great Yu's Divine Mechanism Camp, eventually becoming a master of military explosives. He then used Thunderfire Thunder Pills to blow his original sect sky-high."

---

"..."

Li Mo roughly understood the power of this thing. It probably had a temper as explosive as that "misguided" master of military explosives.

So, was this thing considered a pill?

The genius alchemist Master Xue, who had refined an External Profound Pill, might be able to give an accurate assessment...

"What kind of rewards are these?"

"I'm not planning on blowing up my own sect."

Li Mo frowned and continued scrolling down.

**[Investment Feedback: 4 Calamity-Warding Banners.]**

**[Calamity-Warding Banner]:** "When加持 on a city wall or mountain rock, it can double its defensive capabilities. Its sturdiness depends on the strength of the one maintaining the formation patterns and the ambient spiritual energy."

......

**[Investment Feedback: Thunder Pattern War Drum.]**

**[Thunder Pattern War Drum]:** "A master artisan used the hide of a thunder beast possessing a trace of Kui Niu bloodline to carve thunder patterns, creating a war drum. Its sound can shake the nine heavens, boosting morale and intimidating powerful enemies."

......

**[Investment Feedback: 1 Profound Crystal.]**

**[Investment Feedback: 10,000 Evil-Dispelling Arrows.]**

**[Investment Feedback: 1 Peace Gold Lock.]**

**[Investment Feedback: 1 pair of patched shoes stitched by a mother.]**

......

Besides these, the later rewards were a mix of miscellaneous items.

The only things of value were the Profound Crystals and the military armaments. There were about a thousand Profound Crystals, and seventeen or eighteen types of military armaments, all in considerable quantities.

Looking at the system space filled with Profound Crystals and military armaments—enough to support a small-scale battle—Young Master Li fell into deep thought.

"System, you've been acting quite suspicious lately."

These rewards, except in extremely special circumstances, couldn't be used at all, right? He couldn't even sell them. Even if he dared to sell them in a bundle, no one would be bold enough to buy them. If these were discovered, it would mean the execution of his entire family.

He even had military pay now.

If the system gave him a yellow dragon robe next, it might really be trying to get him to raise a banner and declare himself emperor.

Hmm, he must never let his master find out. She would definitely declare herself the Grand Empress Dowager, and her first act would be to appoint Elder Han He as the Crown Prince.

"Hopefully, I won't need this stuff. It's best if it just rots in the system space."

Li Mo shook his head, driving the images from his mind. It was better to contemplate the Somersault Cloud first...

He took a Seven-Striped Calm Mind Pill and brought out the *Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao*.

"Only Brother Monkey can make me calm."

Young Master Li, the gentleman, was about to focus his mind.

*Swish—*

The sound of water came from beside him.

In the shimmering bath tub, Ying Bing was about to get up when she suddenly froze. A flush of crimson crept up her snow-white, jade-like neck.

She had forgotten something.

Her birthday was coming up, and she would be seventeen. Her body was growing quickly. Her previous undergarments no longer fit. While the Jade Phoenix form could change her appearance and clothes, it did not include what she wore underneath.

She had planned to buy some new ones when she came back today.

But the moment her small hand slipped into the少年's pocket, she had forgotten all about it.

She couldn't possibly go out with nothing underneath...

"..."

Ying Bing grabbed the big-headed doll floating on the water and searched inside it.

A few seconds later.

*Plop—*

The chibi version of Young Master Li plopped back down onto the water in front of her chest, splashing a little water.

Ying Bing pressed her lips together, sitting in the tub with her long legs hugged to her chest.

Nothing.

After a few seconds, a calm and collected voice came from behind the screen.

"Li Mo, I forgot something."

"What is it?"

"Clothes."

......

P.S.: I was flagged by the censors last time because of the 'speeding.' You all know what happened during Ying Bing's massage. Scenes like that might not be in their original form the next time you see them. orz
