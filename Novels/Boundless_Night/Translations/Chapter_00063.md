# Chapter 63: Chance Encounter

Under the cover of night, a colossal, crimson exotic avian beast circled and descended, stirring up gusts of gale-force winds that swept vast amounts of snow from the ground.

"Many thanks for the escort, Senior Crimson Roc!" After Cui Hong leaped to the ground, he courteously bowed to the glowing red giant bird as if it were an elder.

The young man in splendid silken robes, named Cui Chongyi, also bowed, watching the Crimson Roc depart into the distance.

"Uncle Hong, is this where Chonghe is staying? It's too desolate. The fire spring in that small town ahead is of a very low grade, making it difficult to produce any spiritual objects. Why didn't you arrange a better place for him?"

"Young Master, please don't call me Uncle Hong, I don't deserve it," Cui Hong quickly interjected. He appeared to be in his thirties, his arms noticeably long due to practicing the Heaven-Reaching Art.

His face was sharply chiseled, and his gaze was exceptionally keen. He first vigilantly scanned the surroundings before sighing, "I was merely following orders."

Cui Chongyi nodded upon hearing this, finding it awkward to comment further on the matter.

He was under twenty years old, with a tear mole at the corner of his left eye, but he didn't appear to be a sentimental type. Rather, he was quite talkative. "Uncle Hong," he said, "when we're out and about, there's no need for so many formalities. I'll be training outside for a while, and I'll need you to look after me. Let's not be strangers between us."

Cui Hong didn't insist, leading him towards Silver Vine Town.

"Why is this residence unoccupied?" Cui Hong's expression immediately changed as he stood at the town's entrance, seeing that a not-so-small house was empty.

He inquired with nearby residents and finally breathed a sigh of relief. The family hadn't moved out of Silver Vine Town, merely relocated to a larger house in the town center.

The two inquired along the way and eventually found their destination.

"Suspicious target detected." In Silver Vine Town, a speech sparrow flapped its wings and flew away.

Soon after, a furious roar from Cui Hong echoed from the large mansion in the town center: "I gave you a lot of Day Gold back then, and this is how you handle things? You won't live to see another day!"

Cui Chongyi also abruptly stood up, smashing the tea table with a slap, his face extremely grim.

"It's not my fault! He woke up, suddenly clutched his head, and ran out, howling madly. I didn't dare... get close. When I looked for him later, he was gone," a man in his early forties responded, his face pale.

Cui Hong's gaze was terrifying, like two golden lamps igniting, emitting almost tangible beams of light. A powerful, long arm shot out and swiftly pulled the man up by his collar.

The middle-aged man's face instantly drained of color, and he hurriedly explained, "He should be fine. I... I saw him on the street a few days ago, and he looked very energetic."

"Hmm?" This surprised both Cui Hong and Cui Chongyi. Their hearts had already sunk, believing something had gone wrong, never expecting such a turn of events.

The middle-aged man quickly added, "I personally saw him visit the Wu Family with a disheveled old man. He was full of vigor; his illness must have completely healed."

"What's the background of the Wu Family?" Cui Chongyi asked.

"Their ancestors were formidable, known as Dual Masters of Spear and Arrow, once unrivaled in our region. They've declined now, but I estimate that young man might be going to the Wu Family to learn the Rebirth Method."

Cui Hong released him, his expression shifting repeatedly. He muttered to himself, "Has he undergone rebirth in this remote land? I... sigh!"

His brows furrowed deeply. The authoritative middle-aged man of the Cui Family had specifically instructed that Cui Chonghe was to live the life of an ordinary person here.

"Let's find Chonghe first," Cui Chongyi said.

Cui Hong paid a visit to the Wu Family to understand the situation.

Cui Chongyi didn't enter, standing instead on the streets of Silver Vine Town, wanting to experience the local customs and traditions of this remote region.

He didn't wander far, staying within a hundred meters of the Wu Family's main gate, in a nearby shop, inquiring about the prices of local specialties.

"Are the birds in this remote region so bold? It nearly hit me." Cui Chongyi quickly turned his head as a small black bird flew past, brushing his scalp.

Not far away, atop a tall locust tree, a white owl squinted down, muttering to itself, "Not only does he have the accent of the great aristocratic cities, but judging by his reaction, his strength might also be quite fitting. My apologies, young man, but if I capture the wrong person, it's not my concern. I'll use you to help quell the situation first, proving my diligent efforts."

Outside Twin Trees Village, Old Man Liu felt no particular reluctance. Having experienced everything in his advanced age, he was simply there to send off Qin Ming.

"If you can't make it out there, come back early and we'll grow old together."

"You really don't know how to talk, old man. I haven't even left yet; couldn't you say something more auspicious?" Qin Ming said, glancing back at Twin Trees Village. Under the night sky, the black and white twin trees appeared quite extraordinary, illuminated by the fire spring.

Old Man Liu said, "Don't dismiss Black and White Mountain. It was once a place of absolute power, suffocating all factions. Sooner or later, this place will once again stir up trouble!"

Qin Ming looked at the vast mountains, feeling a genuine reluctance to leave, having lived there for two years after all.

"I'm leaving now. Do you have any words of wisdom for me?"

Old Man Liu replied, "Ultimately, there are more good people in this world, but one must always be wary of others. I think you're quite precocious, so I don't need to lecture you on such things. Just pay attention to the people within the city yourself. I'll tell you about two types of people commonly found outside the city that you should be careful of."

Qin Ming had only mentioned it casually, not expecting him to actually have something to say.

"Firstly, elderly itinerant merchants. No matter their strength, do not underestimate them. To dare to travel across the land covered in eternal night, day after day for decades, they must possess some extraordinary abilities. You never know the true identity of some of these merchants, whether they are truly conducting business or searching for something else entirely."

Qin Ming nodded solemnly upon hearing this, indicating he had received the lesson. Today, he was indeed setting off with a team of itinerant merchants.

"Secondly, there are mountain patrols in various regions. Anyone who has safely lived past a hundred years and still frequently ventures into the dark mountains should not be easily provoked, for you do not know what they truly are."

Qin Ming nodded seriously, bidding farewell to Old Man Liu.

"The merchant team you helped me choose departs from Emei Town. Should I, when passing by, perhaps enter the mountains and help you wipe out that nest of monkeys, settling that old grudge you had from your youth?" He was deliberately bringing up an old sore point.

"Get out of here!"

"Haha..." Qin Ming departed amidst laughter, disappearing into the vast snowfield.

In Emei Town, Qin Ming joined the itinerant merchant's team and unexpectedly found a familiar face. The young man before him had once served tea to him and Old Man Liu when he went to the Wu Family to read their secret texts.

"You're... Qin Ming?" Wu Zheng was surprised, then his face lit up with joy, feeling it was fortunate to be traveling with an acquaintance.

"You're also going to Crimson Cloud City?" Qin Ming asked him.

The seventeen-year-old Wu Zheng nodded, saying, "Yes, I want to see the world. Everyone in my Wu Family who has achieved anything has been to Crimson Cloud City to broaden their horizons."

Qin Ming wanted to say, Old Wu had also been there, getting lost in the dazzling allure, daring to spend two pieces of Day Gold in a single night, and after residing there for a period, brought the Wu Family to complete ruin.

"You must hold onto your true heart and understand what you're going there for."

"I want to become the new generation's Dual Master of Spear and Arrow!" The seventeen-year-old youth, already reborn, harbored dreams and aspirations for the future, desiring to strive hard in distant lands.

The leading itinerant merchant was in his early thirties, not one of the elderly merchants Old Man Liu had mentioned, which somewhat put Qin Ming at ease.

Moreover, this merchant named Xu Sheng had a good reputation locally, frequently traveling between Crimson Cloud City and this remote region. Besides trading goods, he also led paid expeditions, guiding people back and forth between the two areas.

"I'm telling you all, ahead lies a vast desert stretching across the land, a place of absolute darkness, without a single speck of light. Once you fall into it, you'll surely die and never emerge. No one is allowed to wander off; you must stick close to me and follow the path along the foot of the mountain. Remember, absolutely do not speak carelessly at the edge of the desert, or something bad will happen!"

On the second day of their journey, Xu Sheng was very serious, giving countless warnings as they approached the desert.

There were no fire springs in the desert; it was utterly dead and lifeless. Even so-called great masters would face a near-certain death if they got trapped within it, seeing nothing and quickly becoming completely lost.

At this moment, they were traversing a plain. Between heaven and earth, only night and white snow remained. As they neared the desert, vegetation became increasingly scarce.

Although it was still early night, this plain area already felt like deep night, as if a colossal abyss ahead was devouring everything.

"What's in the desert that we can't even speak casually?"

Xu Sheng replied, "Even high-level exotic avian beasts don't dare cross the desert, or they will die. Don't you understand its danger level? Furthermore, any reborn individual who shows no respect for the desert will surely face calamity. This is no joke; it's true for deserts in various regions."

"What exactly is going on?" someone asked, unwilling to give up.

"You still want to delve into such questions? There are dozens of explanations. I'll just give you one to dissuade you: according to some secret cults, the desert is connected to important rituals of certain deities. Those who dare to act presumptuously nearby will naturally be given a minor punishment."

Instantly, the team fell silent. A minor punishment meant losing one's life; what would a severe punishment entail?

"Weren't deities said to be merely powerful beings?"

"To *you*, they are gods. Shut your mouth immediately, or get out of my team!"

At this moment, Cui Hong was sitting in the mountain forest, confronting a pure white old elephant, listening to its incessant babbling.

Yesterday, Cui Chongyi had been carried off by a large bird, which completely panicked Cui Hong. He pursued relentlessly, and after delving deep into the mountains, he finally found a clue: he learned that Cui Chongyi had been taken by a Purple Lightning Beast of considerable origin, which suspected him of being a target. Fortunately, his life was not in danger.

Cui Hong tracked him all the way to this spot, only to encounter an unfathomable old elephant. The creature sat cross-legged in the forest, looking like an enlightened master. Most importantly, it had four snow-white tusks.

Cui Hong was taken aback and dumbfounded by the sight.

It wasn't until the old elephant, sitting cross-legged in the forest, carelessly bumped off one of its massive tusks that Cui Hong realized two of them were fake, temporarily affixed.

He flew into a rage. He had wasted so much time, genuinely believing he had encountered a descendant of the Six-Tusk White Elephant.

Boom! A great battle erupted in the mountain forest.

On the third day of the team's journey, Qin Ming witnessed the desert's darkness. Ordinary reborn individuals would indeed instantly get lost if they entered, as it was utterly pitch-black.

Even with his keen hearing, sharp eyesight, and extremely strong perception, he felt a chill in his heart.

Fortunately, they traveled along the large mountains at the desert's edge, using the mountain range as a reference point. As long as they didn't stray, they could pass through smoothly.

As for traversing through the mountains themselves, that was incredibly difficult. They were teeming with territories of various strange creatures, and the mountains were exceptionally tall, making passage extremely arduous.

Rumble!

Suddenly, an enormous sound erupted ahead. The commotion coming from the mountain on one side of the path was tremendous, as various huge rocks tumbled down, nearly crushing the first few members of the team.

"Quick, retreat!" Xu Sheng, the merchant, shouted.

Then, people saw a glowing, pure white old elephant, standing upright, engaged in a fierce battle with a human. It swung its trunk, continuously cleaving out dazzling blade light.

Furthermore, besides the two tusks in its mouth, its upper limbs were as flexible as human arms, adhering to two pure white, jade-like tusks, as if wielding dual blades, continuously slashing at its opponent.

Qin Ming's pupils constricted. Even in such a dark place, he clearly saw the appearance of the person fighting the old elephant.

The white elephant glowed, illuminating the person very clearly.

"A man with very long arms, in his early thirties, with sharply chiseled features, looking very much like the man from those two people I've recently been recalling!"

He was quite surprised to encounter one of the two people who had saved him back then, in such a place.

A master like Cui Hong was extremely perceptive. Being stared at for a long time, he felt a premonition and looked towards the merchant team. His heart instantly leaped; he had unexpectedly found the person he was looking for just like that.
