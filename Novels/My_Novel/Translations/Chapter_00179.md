Chapter 179: Silken Threads and Sweet Whispers in the Tower

Early October.

The season was transitioning from autumn to winter. As soon as he stepped out of the inner courtyard, a chill hit him. Li Xian’s martial arts had advanced greatly, and he was in high spirits. With his hands clasped behind his head, he wandered about, enjoying the sights.

"I’m heading to the Prefecture City... I’ll get to see my younger brother there. I wonder if the wild rumors have affected him?"

"My brother is smart; he probably won't take it to heart."

"I've washed away my muddy nature and my appearance has changed drastically. I wonder if my brother will be surprised when he sees me."

Li Xian strolled around, feeling refreshed and spirited. He stood tall, his spine like a divine mountain, his bones tempered without flaw, his true form fully revealed.

Just by standing there, his demeanor was extraordinary.

"Greetings, Master."

Patrolling guards passed by. When they saw Li Xian, they were momentarily stunned. Once they came to their senses, they bowed respectfully. The more simple-minded ones even knelt and kowtowed. Li Xian nodded affably, telling them not to be拘束 (拘束 - jūshù - restrained/formal), and walked away to continue his aimless wandering.

The guards watched Li Xian leave, their minds drifting to the heavens. They stood there呆立 (呆立 - dāilì - standing stunned) for a good while before chatting: "Master Li is like a god. With such looks and temperament, it's no wonder the Mistress took a liking to him."

"Now, within the manor, aside from the Mistress, Master Li's word is law."

"Heh, you guys have seen too little. It's not just the manor. Who in Qingning County dares not listen to Master Li?"

"When we, the guards of Yihe Manor, go to Qingning County, doesn't everyone look at us with high regard? Even the singing houses and brothels in Qingning County, upon hearing I'm from Yihe Manor, ask me about Master Li."

After a round of envy, they resumed their patrol. Li Xian had walked around the manor several times and was already familiar with the scenery. The barren mountains and dilapidated houses had all been visited.

In a daze, he walked up to a tower.

The plaque read: "Summer Alchemy Tower."

The tower door was locked tight with a cold lock. Li Xian walked around the tower, his mind racing. Regarding the path of martial arts, he had grasped some true transmission. But the Mistress was also proficient in various miscellaneous skills, from which he hadn't picked up a thing.

"Martial artists stand in the world. Relying purely on force to suppress others makes it impossible to go far. Heaven rewards diligence; I make progress every day. Aside from practicing martial arts, I can also learn many miscellaneous skills. When I walk the Jianghu in the future, observing stars, divining, feng shui, alchemy, medicine, compounding... if I涉猎 (涉猎 - shèliè - dabble in) many, why would I not be able to walk my path?"

"Last time at the Yunxiang Pavilion, I mentioned taking medicine. The Mistress didn't agree. The reason might be that she looked down on me. Or perhaps... to enter the tower to refine pills, one must strip naked. Now, if I ask again, I wonder if she would agree."

"Timing is very important. The Mistress is in seclusion tonight. When I assist her in her seclusion, I will bring this matter up. If the Mistress agrees, it will be a sure thing."

Li Xian smelled the fragrance of the pills and was reluctant to leave. He looked and looked, observing again and again. He wandered随意 (随意 - suíyì - aimlessly), and不知不觉 (不知不觉 - bù zhī bù jué - unconsciously) arrived at the outer perimeter of the manor.

Martial artists strive for refinement.

But whenever there is a great advancement, they often stop to rest. Taking advantage of a relaxed mood, they感悟 (感悟 - gǎnwù - comprehend) the heavens and earth, and enjoy the heavens and earth. Li Xian acted entirely according to his heart, which happened to暗合 (暗合 - ànhé - tacitly agree with) this principle.

Passing by a patch of荒草地 (荒草地 - huāngcǎodì - wasteland), he suddenly heard a clamor.

"You old turtle, you've rebelled!"

"You little bastard, I'll fight you to the death!"

In the wasteland, two laborers, having fallen out, were fighting fiercely. They kicked and punched at each other with quite some momentum. After a while, the younger laborer fell into a disadvantage. Instead of retreating, he lunged forward, pushing the older laborer to the ground.

He used the moves of a street hooligan. But it worked perfectly. The two rolled on the ground, entangled, punching and clawing at each other, with an air of fighting to the death.

These two were naturally Bi Hao and Luo Fang.

Luo Fang had been a guard once, and his martial skills were passable. But after years of neglect, his vitality had declined, not as good as in the past.

Plus, he had suffered several major changes this year, demoted from steward to laborer. He couldn't eat his fill or stay warm. He had also taken several beatings, injuring his bones. His former martial stance was hard to assume, and his strength had plummeted.

Bi Hao's martial skills were average, but he had youth on his side. The two were entangled, and the outcome was hard to predict.

They fought for a long time, panting heavily. Bi Hao caught sight of a figure and burst with infinite strength. Luo Fang cursed, "Good boy, using the strength of a bull on your uncle?" He immediately got into a stance, focusing his attention.

But he saw Bi Hao leap towards the distance, kneel on the ground, and kowtow repeatedly. Luo Fang looked over, stunned for a moment, his heart filled with mixed feelings. The current Li Xian had already risen above the dust, unattainable.

Luo Fang stumbled over and also knelt to kowtow, becoming more and more devout. Suddenly, he figured it out, kowtowing until his head was bleeding.

Li Xian had been gone for a long time before the two uncle and nephew came to their senses. But they knelt on the ground for a long time, unwilling to get up. Luo Fang regretted, "I regret it. The opportunity given by the heavens, I failed to grasp it, and ended up in such a state."

He shed tears and runny nose.

Bi Hao said, "It's all because of you, you old turtle. You ruined my future, I'll fight you!"

Li Xian had passed by accidentally. He only glanced once and was already far away. In the evening, he returned to the inner courtyard. After dinner, Li Xian carried a box and went up the Quiet Heart Tower with the Mistress.

The oil lamps along the stairs were bright.

Madam Wen wore a large white robe, the skirt trailing on the ground, the sleeves hanging down to her knees. She clasped her hands in front of her belly. She walked with elegance and grace.

Li Xian followed behind, smelling the fragrant breeze. Madam Wen said, "Xiao Xian, light the lamps."

They reached a spacious room, and Li Xian lit the lamps on all four sides. The glow filled the room. The Quiet Heart Tower wasn't high. The tower's intention was to seek tranquility and stillness; the top was flat.

It did not compete for height, but for stability. It did not compete for movement, but for stillness.

Madam Wen's pretty face was slightly flushed, with a hint of joy, shyness, and awkwardness. Her emotions were very subtle and never显露 (显露 - xiǎnlù - revealed). Only in this quiet room could one see a bit of it. Originally, when Qiu Qiuyue assisted her in practicing this technique, she found it extremely烦不甚烦 (烦不甚烦 - fán bù shèn fán - extremely annoyed), thinking: "This technique is powerful, but it's so troublesome."

But she had no choice.

Now it was different. Her heart was filled with unspeakable feelings, and she didn't find it annoying at all.

Li Xian opened the wooden box. Inside was the Green Silken Cord. It was a greenish-silver color, vaguely transparent. Holding it in his hand, it felt as light as nothing. According to Li Xian, this cord was unique.

Donning the Silken Garment was extremely complex, involving acupoints and the flow of Qi, with many essential points. Li Xian's Green Luo Palm had reached its peak, and coupled with his "Masterful Hands" trait, he mastered it very quickly.

The green cord first wound around the neck, locking various crucial points, propping up numerous acupoints. The contact was indescribably微妙 (微妙 - wēimiào - subtle/exquisite). Li Xian asked at this time, "Mistress, is the cord path of the Silken Garment correct?"

Madam Wen nodded slightly, her heart already unsettled. Ripples of soft sweetness spread. Throughout her life, she had always been the one in control. Only at this moment, she couldn't be tough.

Li Xian asked, "By the way, Mistress, it seems you haven't refined pills for a long time."

"How can one refine pills every day?" Madam Wen said softly.

Li Xian got straight to the point: "Mistress, to be honest, I... want to learn alchemy. Can you teach me?"

Madam Wen嗔道 (嗔道 - chēndào - said with feigned anger), "You brat, you really know how to pick a time. Asking now, is it so I can't refuse you?"

"Not exactly," Li Xian said. "To be honest, Mistress, it's only here that I feel particularly close to you."

Madam Wen's heart stirred, her affection like water. She gave him a风情万种 (风情万种 - fēngqíng wànzhǒng - incredibly charming) glance. "Sweet talk. Alchemy... is a combination of many disciplines. To master it, you need to understand feng shui and construction, the Five Elements and the Eight Trigrams. You also need a solid martial arts foundation. It's very difficult."

"The alchemy sects in the world are varied and strange. The higher the grade of the pill, the greater the effort required. Let me tell you..."

Madam Wen's tone was gentle as she continued, "There was once a rare divine pill that appeared, shocking the world. Do you know how this divine pill was refined?"

Li Xian, while donning the Silken Garment, asked, "Please tell me, Mistress."

"This divine pill cost decades of effort. It summoned hundreds of thousands of common people to build a sacrificial altar on a snowy mountain."

"On the altar sat the Yellow Dragon Cauldron. The herbs poured in were all rare divine medicines. The fire used was all rare divine fire. The cauldron fire roiled, the sky split and the earth shook, intimidating the world."

Li Xian gasped and listened attentively. Madam Wen's upper body was already hard to move; her arms and crucial points were all bound. She leaned her head back and said, "Do you think it was done then?"

"It couldn't be done?" Li Xian asked.

"Far from it!" Madam Wen said. "That figure maintained the divine fire continuously for three years. But it was hard to form the divine pill. At that time, an enemy nation invaded, and he sent troops to resist."

"The battles of war actually helped complete the pill. So that figure campaigned everywhere, killing without cease, and the divine pill gradually formed."

"Tell me, how great is the value of this pill?"

"Incalculable." It was the first time Li Xian had heard of such a treasure. "Too heavy, too heavy. Countless lives."

Madam Wen said, "I tell you this secret, first... for恩 (恩 - ēn - gratitude)..." Madam Wen's pretty face flushed, she glanced at Li Xian, and continued, "To let you know the vastness of the world. Second..."

"The method of alchemy is not simply throwing in herbs and applying great fire to bake, and a pill is formed. A rare precious pill is equivalent to a rare precious object."

"And the birth of a rare precious object requires the right time and place, and the mysterious promotion of the heavens and earth..."

At this point, her tone became increasingly荡漾 (荡漾 - dàngyàng - wavering/unstable). Donning the Silken Garment, locking the acupoints, there were inevitably places that were不便言说 (不便言说 - bù biàn yán shuō - hard to speak of). Madam Wen said, "Therefore, a precious pill also requires various factors. Of course, in this vast world, there are alternative ways to form pills."

Li Xian's heart itched slightly. He suppressed his agitation and said, "Mistress, can you explain the key points in detail? I want to broaden my horizons."

"Alright." Madam Wen放宽 (放宽 - fàngkuān - relaxed) her mind. "That figure's alchemy had several stages. First, building momentum. Building the sacrificial altar was to build momentum. How high the momentum rises determines how strong the pill is."

"Usually, alchemists would build towers, pavilions, and other buildings as the building of momentum. Then, raising the pill. Different pill natures require different methods. For ordinary pills, controlling the fire and herbs... might suffice. Some pills, however, are much more complex."

This path was vast. Madam Wen's words for a moment couldn't explain it clearly. Certain parts needed to be seen with the eyes and felt with the heart. Verbal communication could lead to misunderstandings.

Madam Wen said softly, "If you are truly interested, when I build a furnace to refine pills in the future, I will allow you to enter the tower to learn. I will顺便 (顺便 - shùnbiàn -顺便) explain the essentials to you."

"In my bedroom, there are a few books on alchemy. If you have the time, you may go and read them."

"But the banquet in the Prefecture City is approaching. You need to be clear about the priority. Don't let the minor things affect the major ones."

"Thank you, Mistress." Hearing that the Mistress finally agreed, Li Xian couldn't help but feel a surge of joy. At this moment, the Silken Garment was complete.

"That's it. You may leave now," Madam Wen said.

Li Xian went straight into the bedroom and found a few books on essential alchemy techniques on the bookshelf. He skimmed through them roughly. The principles within were obscure and difficult to understand. All things in the world could be used for alchemy.

Li Xian was now driven entirely by curiosity. He didn't seek to fully understand. He read through them once, remembered what he could, and let go of what he couldn't.

He was full of energy, feeling his internal Qi充盈 (充盈 - chōngyíng - abundant), just a hair's breadth from the "Thirty-two Zhang."

After reading, he practiced martial arts.

[Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword · Layer 1]
[Proficiency: 23699/50000 (Perfected)]

[Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword · Layer 2]
[Proficiency: 3859/5000 (Small Accomplishment)]

Both had improved.

The Genius Assembly was imminent. Li Xian's heart was surging. The ambition of a youth ultimately wanted to trade blows with geniuses.

Could the Evil Captain cause waves when he entered the city?

Suddenly, his whole body made a "bang" sound. Qi was like a tidal wave. He had stepped into the Thirty-two Zhang!
