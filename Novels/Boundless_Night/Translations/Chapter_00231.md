**Chapter 231: The Strongest Young Lishi**

The fiery red maple forest was awash with falling red leaves, tinged with a hint of autumn's desolation.

Coupled with Qin Ming's unleashed Saber Intent, which severed the hundred grasses on the ground, a bone-chilling cold permeated the deadly atmosphere.

He was truly astonished. The opponent had blocked his saber strikes repeatedly, even enduring his two ultimate techniques. Her strength was impossibly high.

Evidently, both of them were surprised by each other, feeling that the opponent's performance far exceeded expectations!

Qin Ming suspected her identity. Was she an Immortal Scion from the real world? He had never seen or heard of one.

From her words and actions, she seemed more like an ancient person.

However, the woman's consciousness spiritual light was too real, unlike those he had encountered before.

Since that was the case, he would unleash his full power and gauge this woman. Was she from the present world or an ancient ghost? To what extent had she reached? He would know after testing her.

Qin Ming controlled the Five Qi, and the five-colored light wheel spun rapidly around his body, making his fluttering hair sparkle. The five-colored saber in his hand hummed and roared, as if wanting to break through the air and fly away.

Indeed, the next moment, he lifted off the ground, employing the Saber Control Art. His physical body and the five-colored saber seemed to merge into one, and a five-colored divine aura illuminated the fiery red maple forest.

The night dispersed, and the area became as bright as day. Every leaf, every branch, was illuminated by the five-colored light, their veins clearly visible, and saber light was omnipresent.

Qin Ming moved with his saber, like a five-colored lightning bolt, instantly killing his way forward. Such speed and such unparalleled saber light were simply devastating.

Along the way, anything that stood in his path—century-old trees, sprawling branches, and falling red leaves—disintegrated in the saber light, first split in two by him, then exploding.

The purple-clad woman's large sleeves, wrapped in her consciousness spiritual light, seemed to transform into pure Yang immortal swords, continuously parrying. The forest immediately filled with countless red leaves dancing, then shattering.

Qin Ming, in his green robes, and the stunning woman in purple robes became entangled, like two moving lightning bolts, constantly clashing with each other and then swiftly passing by.

"Who is that? How dare they fight in the maple forest? Don't they know that's a forbidden area, where Senior Sister Chu channels her thoughts? Ordinary disciples wouldn't dare to set foot there!"

Many ancient disciples in this area were startled, finding it unbelievable that someone was damaging the maple forest.

Soon, they were shocked, because someone was moving with a saber, not only cutting down the forest but also engaging in combat with the rumored Senior Sister Chu!

"Senior Sister Chu Pianran has rarely appeared these past few years. She came here today to channel her thoughts, but was she actually offended by someone?"

"A newcomer is rising! He actually lasted this long and hasn't lost yet!"

Qin Ming vaguely heard the discussions of those disciples in the distance, and his heart surged. This woman was clearly an ancient person, so why wasn't she illusory?

He had used spiritual resonance to verify it.

"Are ancient Lishi all so outrageous? How can he be so powerful! But, why do I feel... he's more like an External Saint?"

"Could he be from the present world like us? Is he actually a newcomer, who dares to challenge that ancient immortal maiden who is channeling her thoughts here!"

More people appeared, their discussions and perceptions entirely different from those earlier ancient disciples.

Qin Ming understood that these were Immortal Path disciples, people from the present world like himself, who had "entered the play."

Such people could probably discern his true origin.

When he "entered the play," he was now an inner disciple of this place, and almost all the ancient disciples did not find him amiss, nor did they consider him a Lishi.

Because he seemed to have exploited some kind of loophole.

Only the purple-clad woman felt that he was a Lishi, and she had recognized it at a glance.

"Living people can discern my roots, but those departed ancients can't recognize my identity?!" When he guessed this possibility, he was terrified.

Could it be that this woman's true body was still alive?

The purple-clad woman's features were exquisite, and every movement was graceful, as if she were dancing. Yet, when she struck, her power was incredibly immense and unmatched.

After an intense battle, Qin Ming stood with his saber sheathed.

His expression was more serious than ever before. He had truly encountered an extraordinary opponent, one he dared not treat with the slightest carelessness.

Besides the five-colored light wheel, three-colored divine aura flowed around his body, and his eight miraculous techniques resonated, manifesting abnormal phenomena and forming a protective light barrier.

At this moment, Qin Ming appeared exceptionally clear and transcendent, unstained by dust, his body like divine glass, radiating precious brilliance, with Daoist charm in his eyes and brows.

"This is truly unexpected. I once tested my sword throughout the world, and among my peers, few could withstand my full power. Yet you, merely a Lishi, have reached this level."

Chu Pianran's purple robes fluttered in the fiery red maple forest. Although she was formed from pure Yang spiritual light, she looked no different from a real body.

"What is Senior Sister Chu saying? Isn't he an inner disciple? How did he become a Lishi? My thoughts are in a mess!"

These were the words of the ancient disciples. They were confused, being characters within the 'play,' this went beyond their understanding, and they all frowned.

"Hiss, this is heaven-defying! A newcomer from our present world, entering the ancient immortal world's dojo, can actually contend against the most renowned Immortal Maiden Chu here?"

"Indeed, he can contend against a segment of her consciousness spiritual light, but both seem to be on the same level! This is absolutely outlandish!"

Undoubtedly, these were the discussions of people from the present world.

Qin Ming even glanced over and recognized some old acquaintances, such as Chen Bingyan and Lu Zhenyi, whom he had met when he was still Cui Chonghe.

There were also Ren Yiping and Sun Jingyuan, both of whom held extremely transcendent positions as core disciples of the Outer Pure Land, whom he had seen at the Mount Luofu Immortal Ruins.

They found it incredibly hard to believe that a newcomer from the present world could contend with the most legendary immortal maiden of an immortal dojo in ancient times!

It was important to note that she was the first in line to inherit the position of sect master of that dojo.

"Are you an ancient person who has lived until this era?" Qin Ming asked.

However, the other party did not respond.

A subtle look of surprise appeared in Chu Pianran's beautiful eyes as she carefully scrutinized him.

Qin Ming stood still, eight types of light flowing around his body, like a young god standing in a pure land, appearing increasingly sacred and transcendent.

His eight miraculous techniques resonated, and he wasn't worried about being remembered, because after reaching the second realm, he would melt and refine "heterogeneous substances," and the external divine light would constantly change.

Currently, bathed in divine aura, he looked like an immortal or a god, seemingly unrelated to the "Lishi" mentioned by the purple-clad woman.

At this moment, Qin Ming himself began to emit a saber hum, like a saber from beyond the heavens, accompanied by eight miraculous phenomena, slashing forward.

He merged with the eight-colored heavenly saber, and his entire being moved with the saber, briefly soaring through the air, crashing down.

In an instant, nine colors bloomed from Chu Pianran's glabella. Immortal swords, one after another, materialized, forming a pure Yang sword array, all flowing with sun-like brilliance.

All pure Yang swords arrayed themselves around her, then, like a phoenix spreading its wings, slowly unfolded in mid-air, forming a colorful pure Yang sword forest, sacred yet terrifying, slashing towards the eight-colored heavenly saber.

In an instant, the two fiercely clashed and attacked each other, erupting in extremely dazzling light. Pure Yang spiritual light and sun-like divine light energy splattered, as if igniting the entire maple forest.

If it were ordinary Immortal Path disciples, Qin Ming's divine light energy could quickly burn through their consciousness spiritual light, but he found it difficult to do so against this woman.

The current Qin Ming was no longer limited to saber techniques, integrating miraculous techniques with various combat skills, such as the Blazing Sun Sword Art, Wind-Thunder Saber Control Art, and Overlord's Halberd, all coming to him with ease.

The帛book scriptures emphasized integration and mastery of various methods. He was also gradually unifying his core combat styles, thus constantly growing stronger.

Amidst the clang of weapons and the reflection of saber light, saber intent filled all directions. The swiftly passing eight-colored saber, strike after strike, revealed the purple-clad woman's pale face, the blade always extremely close to her.

Those ancient disciples were dumbfounded. A mere youth could actually battle Senior Sister Chu to this extent? It was too dreamlike!

Finally, as the pure Yang consciousness spiritual light fragmented, two of Chu Pianran's pure Yang immortal swords, spread like phoenix wings, broke. She retreated at extreme speed.

People saw a corner of her long purple sleeve sliced off. Additionally, a bloodstain appeared on her fair cheek, trickling with blood, and a lock of her hair floated down.

This was her pure Yang body; bleeding signified injury, and it looked no different from real bloodstains.

Chu Pianran's elegant figure was tall and graceful, and her stunning face bore streaks of blood. This injury added a "battle-worn" allure to her.

In the distance, the ancient disciples were lost in thought, completely silent.

Chu Pianran murmured to herself, "I was actually injured. Well, this is merely where my thoughts are channeled, not my true body. It's just a segment of consciousness spiritual light, so it's understandable."

People from the present world were horrified. A segment of pure Yang consciousness spiritual light was far from her complete self, and vastly different from her true body arriving. Yet she was already this terrifying?

Chu Pianran showed a strange expression and said, "Even so, among Lishi of the same level, you are certainly the strongest. In my era, there was never a Lishi like you. In fact, if you were in the same realm, you might very well contend with the strongest disciples of the major sects."

She transformed into a shower of light and departed, not lingering in the maple forest, leaving only a mass of red leaves falling.

Those ancient disciples felt their thoughts confused. Being characters in the 'play,' they couldn't discern clearly and didn't understand why Senior Sister Chu said that. Was that familiar inner disciple truly a Lishi?

Meanwhile, people from the present world were shocked. This newcomer actually received such a high evaluation from the heir of an immortal lineage—"The Strongest Young Lishi"?!

To them, this was explosive news.

In this era, was there actually an External Saint with such terrifying potential?!

"It's not our old friend, is it?" Chen Bingyan secretly transmitted her voice, with a look of doubt and uncertainty.

Lu Zhenyi shook her head, saying, "Certainly not. Although he once had extraordinary performances and extremely high talent on the path of newcomers, he shouldn't have reached this step."

In the deepest part of this vast immortal dojo, in a crystal coffin, Chu Pianran fully awakened and said, "Master, the undying paste in the coffin has thinned, and Kunling has undergone changes. We should seize this opportunity to change our original trajectory and break out!"

Immortal mist flowed. This area actually had several crystal coffins, all with life forms reviving within them.

Qin Ming pondered that if his status here increased again, he should seize the opportunity to utilize the resources of the immortal dojo to verify his own methods and test out his path forward. Perhaps there were extraordinary "heterogeneous substances" here?
