# Chapter 35: Pursuit Outside the City

The wait turned out to be much longer than Wei Qian had anticipated.

Another two and a half months passed, during which they had to pay eight low-grade spirit stones for accommodation fees. Fortunately, Li Wanqing covered Wei Qian's living expenses in Danding Immortal City.

During this period, the Xiao family auctioned off six Foundation Establishment Pills, all sold at standard prices. However, the financially strained Li family cultivators could only watch helplessly, unable to participate.

Li Wanhai couldn't help but mutter, "If Brother Qing had brought those thirty thousand spirit stones with him, our family might have secured another Foundation Establishment Pill and produced another Foundation Establishment cultivator!"

Hearing this, Wei Qian thought to himself: That was impossible. Li Wanqing's group had originally been considered sacrificial pawns—who could guarantee he would survive the journey to Danding Immortal City? If Li Wanqing had died and the thirty thousand spirit stones in his storage pouch had been seized by the Wang family, it might have been the Wangs producing another Foundation Establishment cultivator instead.

"It's useless," Li Wanqing said with resignation. "To break through, I took the Purple Mist Pill; to escape from Wang Shanyin, I consumed the Bloodburning Pill. My foundation is severely damaged, leaving me with little hope of reaching Foundation Establishment."

He added, "Meanwhile, the Wang family has likely secured another Foundation Establishment Pill at this auction."

Although Li Wanlong's successful Foundation Establishment had alleviated some of the family's pressure, the Li family of Wuling Mountain would still need to tread carefully for decades to come.

Suddenly, a message-carrying paper crane fluttered over and landed on Li Wanqing's shoulder. After listening to its contents, his face lit up with joy. "The Patriarch has arrived!"

Hearing this, everyone's spirits lifted—including Wei Qian's. The arrival of the Li family Patriarch meant they could finally leave.

The Xiao family had allowed those who purchased Foundation Establishment Pills to attempt their breakthroughs within Danding Immortal City. As the Xiao clan's stronghold, the city was far safer than places like Black Flood Dragon Immortal City, which teemed with all manner of unsavory characters.

For instance, when Li Wanlong underwent his Foundation Establishment in Black Flood Dragon Immortal City, Patriarch Li Xianyao had to stand guard. Here, however, while the Wang family members underwent their breakthroughs, Wang Shanyin could spare the time to pursue them.

Wei Qian suspected that if their group tried to leave, Wang Shanyin would likely chase them outside the city. Given what he knew of the Wang family's temperament, he considered this highly probable.

Personally, Wei Qian wasn't afraid of Wang Shanyin's pursuit. Once separated from the main group, Wang Shanyin would undoubtedly focus on chasing Li Wanqing and the others. A "small fry" like himself would only warrant pursuit from other Wang family cultivators.

As long as no Foundation Establishment cultivators were involved, Wei Qian had nothing to fear.

"But with Patriarch Li and Li Wanlong here, our return journey should be safe," Wei Qian thought.

Without delay, Li Wanqing, Wei Qian, and the others headed straight for the city gates, eager to rendezvous with the Li family's two Foundation Establishment experts and return to Wuling Mountain.

At the city gate, each of them handed over their tokens to a middle-aged man in embroidered robes—a Qi Refinement seventh-layer cultivator—who cheerfully remarked, "Another auction will be held in the city soon. Though there won't be any Foundation Establishment Pills, there will be other pills to assist in breakthrough. Wouldn't you like to stay and see?"

"No need," Li Wanqing replied politely. "We're only interested in Foundation Establishment Pills. Perhaps next time they're available, I'll return." The man's robes bore the character "Xiao," marking him as a member of the Xiao clan, which warranted this courteous response.

Seeing the Li family's disinterest in conversation, the robed man smiled and said no more. Once the group had departed and their figures grew distant, he summoned another message-carrying paper crane and whispered a few words into it. The crane then fluttered toward a certain location within the city.

"Patriarch! Family Head!"

When the three remaining Li family members saw Patriarch Li and Li Wanlong descend from the sky, their eyes reddened with emotion.

Patriarch Li's gaze lingered on Li Wanhai's severed hand. "You've suffered," he sighed.

"As long as Brother Long successfully established his foundation, all sacrifices are worth it," Li Wanqing said.

Li Wanlong strode forward and addressed Li Wanqing solemnly: "Little Brother Qing, I will never forget your act of selflessness. The next candidate for Foundation Establishment in our family will be Guchen!"

He made this promise publicly before the entire group.

"Your word is enough, Brother Long," Li Wanqing replied, as if he had much more to say but could only muster this simple response.

"Enough talk. Let's return to Wuling Mountain first," Patriarch Li said, summoning a flying carpet-shaped magical tool. Once everyone boarded, the carpet ascended and sped into the distance.

"Hmm, the design of this flying carpet is quite unique—it has an exotic flair," Wei Qian mused, his attention caught by this peculiar detail.

The two Foundation Establishment cultivators took turns channeling their spiritual power to control the artifact, flying nonstop for four hundred li.

During one such rotation between Patriarch Li and Li Wanlong, the former suddenly sensed something and sharply descended toward the ground.

Wei Qian's heart leapt into his throat—something was wrong. Though his cultivation was too low to detect the threat, he knew danger had arrived.

A streak of cyan light flashed from the side, slashing toward Li Wanqing on the flying carpet. At the critical moment, Li Wanlong summoned a jade ring artifact, barely deflecting the attack. The ring cracked upon impact, making Wei Qian's pupils constrict.

Only a spirit artifact—a tool usable exclusively by Foundation Establishment cultivators—could damage a magical instrument in a single strike!

"Old Ghost Wang, you still can't shake your despicable habits!" Patriarch Li roared, summoning a long blade radiating formidable spiritual energy. Wei Qian guessed this must also be a spirit artifact.

"I knew it wouldn't be this easy!" Wei Qian cursed inwardly, his body tensing as he prepared to flee.

A small flying vessel descended from the sky. At its helm stood the Wang family's elder Foundation Establishment cultivator, Wang Fengri, who sneered, "Enough talk, Li Xianyao. You go first—I'll join you soon enough!" Beside him stood none other than Wang Shanyin.

Wei Qian barely glanced at the six others aboard the vessel. As long as none were Foundation Establishment cultivators or capable of Foundation-level techniques, they posed no threat in his eyes.

With grave urgency, Patriarch Li commanded, "Go now! Wanlong and I will hold them off!"

Before the words fully left his mouth, Wei Qian was already sprinting toward his chosen escape route. His physical cultivation, comparable to a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, allowed him to keep pace with even Elder Wanqing, who was at the Great Perfection of Qi Refinement.

Wang Fengri chuckled darkly. "We already made the mistake of letting your Li family produce another Foundation Establishment cultivator. Did you think we'd repeat it? My Wang family has paid dearly to ensure your end today."

He then shouted, "Fellow Daoist Shi, it's time!" 

Suddenly, another Foundation Establishment aura erupted beside Li Wanlong.
