# Chapter 110: The Old Monk  

"I do not recognize these ruffians!" The old monk Duyuan said with a smile.  

With these words, he had already defined the nature of Han Yu and his group. From the scene, it was clear that this had been a targeted ambush.  

"Young benefactor, I see you have a deep understanding of Buddhist teachings. Would you be willing to join our Buddhist order?" Monk Duyuan then asked.  

The 'Vajra Body Protection Technique' had been widely circulated, but few had truly mastered this Buddhist body-refining method.  

This was because it required the support of Buddhist teachings—without them, even the basics were impossible to grasp.  

The Vajra power within Li Shiming's body indicated that he had studied Buddhist teachings deeply, giving him the foundation to practice the 'Vajra Body Protection Technique.'  

Moreover, the two majestic Buddhist chants Li Shiming had just recited made Monk Duyuan sense a profound connection between him and Buddhism.  

"Venerable Master, I am a disciple of the Tianhai Sect and have no intention of converting to Buddhism," Li Shiming quickly declined.  

"Benefactor, I heard the two Buddhist chants you recited earlier. May I ask who composed them?" Monk Duyuan shifted the topic with a smile.  

"They were my humble scribblings," Li Shiming claimed authorship.  

Though he felt somewhat guilty toward the original authors from his past life, in this world, he was the only one who knew these two songs.  

"Young benefactor, you truly have a connection with Buddhism!" Monk Duyuan did not doubt him. While there were many Buddhist chants in the world, few were unknown to him. He then added, "It's a pity that such Buddhist chants were paired with demonic sound techniques, diminishing their essence."  

"That demonic sound technique wasn't taught by my sect. I studied it after being harmed by it," Li Shiming quickly explained.  

He didn’t want Monk Duyuan to mistake him for a demon and "liberate" him.  

"Of course, I could tell. Your demonic sound technique surpasses the Xuanming Sect’s 'Demonic Sound Infiltration' in skill, but you haven’t grasped even a fraction of its spiritual power application," Monk Duyuan said, his gaze filled with eagerness.  

The Buddhist tradition also excelled in sound-based techniques. He had suspected earlier that Li Shiming hadn’t truly learned 'Demonic Sound Infiltration,' and now, after hearing his explanation, he understood the reason.  

Li Shiming had used his talent to analyze 'Demonic Sound Infiltration,' but due to his limited cultivation level, he couldn’t delve deeper into its spiritual power application.  

However, in terms of sound wave techniques, he had developed his own unique style.  

The true 'Demonic Sound Infiltration' couldn’t be applied to Buddhist chants—the two were fundamentally different.  

"Venerable Master, your insight is truly extraordinary!" Li Shiming quickly responded.  

"Benefactor, the two Buddhist chants you recited seem incomplete. May I see the full versions? I won’t let you suffer a loss—I can offer you the Buddhist technique 'Lotus Speech' in exchange," Monk Duyuan said with a faint smile.  

Li Shiming felt relieved. So this was the old monk’s true intention.  

They were just two songs. Even if Monk Duyuan hadn’t offered anything and simply demanded them, Li Shiming wouldn’t have dared to refuse.  

In the world of cultivation, strength dictated reason. Monk Duyuan’s strength far surpassed Li Shiming’s, leaving him no room to refuse.  

"If the Venerable Master likes them, I’ll gladly offer them to you," Li Shiming said, retrieving paper and a brush from his storage bag.  

Given his current abilities, without spiritual sense, he couldn’t inscribe information onto jade slips.  

Fortunately, his original body had studied music, so he quickly transcribed the two Buddhist chants onto paper, including detailed annotations on the instruments to accompany them.  

For instruments that didn’t exist in this world, he substituted similar ones.  

Monk Duyuan stood nearby, watching him write.  

"Excellent calligraphy, lyrics, and composition!" Monk Duyuan praised as he read the content.  

His delight was unmistakable.  

These two Buddhist chants were unlike any others in the world. Beyond influencing cultivators' minds in battle, they could also be used to spread Buddhist teachings—a far greater merit and what Monk Duyuan valued most.  

"Venerable Master, here you go," Li Shiming handed the completed lyrics and music to Monk Duyuan.  

Monk Duyuan accepted them with both hands, showing his reverence.  

"Two Buddhist chants in exchange for 'Lotus Speech' still leaves you at a disadvantage. I’ve also studied the 'Vajra Body Protection Technique.' Here is a relic from a senior who mastered it—I’ll give it to you as well," Monk Duyuan said, storing the lyrics and retrieving a jade slip and a small box to hand to Li Shiming.  

Li Shiming was momentarily stunned. The relics of Buddhist cultivators were not like those of ordinary monks.  

Highly accomplished Buddhist cultivators would condense part of their spirit into relics upon death.  

A relic from a monk who had mastered the 'Vajra Body Protection Technique' would contain the senior’s lifelong insights into Vajra power. Moreover, carrying such a relic could even enhance the generation of Vajra power.  

For Monk Duyuan to casually bestow such a treasure left Li Shiming astonished. He couldn’t help but wonder about the old monk’s identity.  

His knowledge of the cultivation world was limited—he only knew about the Tianhai Sect and the Xuanming Sect. Beyond that, he was ignorant.  

Still, with such benefits presented by a far more powerful senior, refusing wasn’t an option.  

"Thank you, Venerable Master," Li Shiming bowed and accepted the two items.  

Monk Duyuan smiled faintly, said nothing more, and floated upward. A gourd appeared beneath him, carrying him into the distance.  

Li Shiming stared at the jade slip and the relic box in his hands, feeling as if he were in a dream.  

With the jade slip in hand, he wasted no time.  

He placed it against his forehead, and a flood of information entered his mind, recorded by IBMz15 as a document titled 'Lotus Speech.'  

'Lotus Speech' bore some resemblance to 'Demonic Sound Infiltration,' both being sound-based techniques. However, 'Lotus Speech' was a Buddhist method, requiring the support of Buddhist intent to unleash its full power during cultivation and use.  

"Buddhist techniques are truly domineering!" Li Shiming sighed inwardly after a cursory review.  

To practice Buddhist techniques, one had to study Buddhist teachings deeply, using them to fortify the mind. Otherwise, ordinary cultivators who engaged with them for long would either suffer qi deviation or fall under Buddhism’s influence, becoming true followers.  

This was an overt dominance, unlike the covert influence of 'Demonic Sound Infiltration.' Prolonged practice of such demonic techniques would gradually warp one’s mind.  

Having experience with the 'Vajra Body Protection Technique,' Li Shiming had his own methods for handling Buddhist techniques.  

As for the relic in the small box, he didn’t take it out. He decided to wait until he returned to the sect and consulted someone knowledgeable about relics.  

He didn’t believe that an old monk he’d just met would be so generous as to gift him such a treasure.  

After cleaning up the battlefield, Li Shiming took Han Yu away from Changshi Valley, finding a secluded spot to interrogate him.  

---  

Three days after Li Shiming’s departure, Yin Shilan arrived at a small island about five hundred li from the Nine Peaks aboard a flying boat.  

"Sister!" A petite figure in a peach-colored, floor-length dress with embroidered plum blossoms rushed toward Yin Shilan.  

"Fei’er, why are you here?" Yin Shilan smiled, catching the flying figure.  

"Someone’s bullying you—I came to help!" Ren Fei’er declared, waving her small fists.  

"With Father around, who would dare bully me?" Yin Shilan gently patted her cheek.  

Yin Shilan’s usually cool demeanor melted away in front of Ren Fei’er. Perhaps only around those closest to her did her true self emerge.  

"Waiting for your father to handle it? The enemy’s already at the door, and he’s still in seclusion!" A voice rang out from the island, followed by the appearance of a woman in a black dress.  

"Mother!" Yin Shilan stepped forward and bowed.  

"That brat from the Baili family—what makes him worthy of my Lan’er?" The black-dressed woman took Yin Shilan’s hand and scrutinized her.  

Had Yin Shilan not addressed her as "Mother," no one would have guessed the two were mother and daughter—they looked more like sisters.  

However, women in the cultivation world often invested heavily in maintaining their youth, so appearing young was common.  

"Lan’er, during your time back at the sect, did you see that Baili boy?" the black-dressed woman asked casually.  

She was here to resolve the issue. If she had the moral high ground, she’d act accordingly. If not, she’d handle it differently.  

"Why would I see Baili Jinyan?" Yin Shilan immediately shook her head.  

"Good. That old fox Baili actually came to interrogate you about his son’s whereabouts—does he think I’m some weak woman?" the black-dressed woman said with a light laugh.  

Elder Baili of the Sacred Ice Sect, Baili Jinyan’s father, had personally come to the Tianhai Sect’s waters.  

Elder Baili had left a third-grade treasure in his son’s body, containing a drop of his own essence blood, which resonated with him.  

When the treasure was activated, he sensed that Baili Jinyan’s final life-saving measure had been triggered, meaning his son was in mortal danger.  

Elder Baili immediately set out for the Tianhai Sect. Given the vast distance between the two sects, even as a Golden Core cultivator, it took him considerable time to arrive.  

From his senses, Baili Jinyan wasn’t dead—just missing.  

Though anxious, he could only seek the Tianhai Sect’s assistance.  

After three days of investigation, the Tianhai Sect found no leads.  

Meanwhile, news from the Sacred Ice Sect revealed that Baili Jinyan had come to the Tianhai Sect to pursue Yin Shilan. Elder Baili thus focused his suspicions on her.  

Yin Shilan’s status was special—her father was a Tianhai Sect elder, equal in strength to Elder Baili.  

Even though Elder Yin was in seclusion, other sect elders wouldn’t allow Elder Baili to confront Yin Shilan directly.  

If Elder Baili acted rashly, the consequences could be severe.  

The matter might have been delayed further, but Elder Baili’s lingering presence at the Tianhai Sect’s borders unsettled the sect.  

A Golden Core cultivator’s influence was no small matter.  

Elder Baili aimed to pressure the Tianhai Sect into letting him question Yin Shilan about Baili Jinyan’s disappearance.  

Had Yin Shilan’s father not been in seclusion, this would have been a matter between the two elders. But now, it had escalated into a dispute between the Tianhai and Sacred Ice Sects.  

When news of this reached the black-dressed woman, she brought Ren Fei’er to meet Yin Shilan outside the sect.  

---  

"Sister, did you get a new treasure?" Ren Fei’er leaned against Yin Shilan and suddenly asked curiously.  

She sensed something on Yin Shilan’s person—anything her sister wore couldn’t be ordinary.  

As she spoke, she reached for it. Few in the world would dare to be so bold.  

A delicate pocket watch appeared in Ren Fei’er’s hand. She opened it, observing the moving hands. Inheriting her sister’s intelligence, she quickly deduced its purpose from the twelve-hour dial and three hands.  

"Sister, can I have it?" Ren Fei’er blinked her large eyes pleadingly.  

This tactic had never failed her before.  

Though the sisters lived apart, they met often, and Yin Shilan doted on her younger sister, always sharing her treasures.  

"Not this time," Yin Shilan said uncharacteristically, snatching the watch back.  

Ren Fei’er stared at her empty hand in disbelief—this was the first time her request had ever been denied.  

"Mother! Sister has a sweetheart!" Ren Fei’er suddenly announced to the black-dressed woman.  

The black-dressed woman had been watching their exchange. For cultivators to have two children was rare—without a stroke of luck during a perilous journey, even one child would drain a Golden Core cultivator’s vitality.  

Due to her and Elder Yin’s unique circumstances, each had taken one child, with their surnames following their respective parents.  

Though Yin Shilan didn’t share her surname, the black-dressed woman’s love for her was undiminished.  

Hearing Ren Fei’er’s report, the black-dressed woman initially dismissed it. As a mother, she knew Yin Shilan’s aloof nature well—she had even worried her daughter might remain alone forever.  

Of course, cultivators didn’t necessarily need to marry. Many pursued immortality in solitude.  

But the black-dressed woman hoped Yin Shilan would find someone to rely on—even as a Golden Core cultivator, she believed a fulfilling life included love.  

"Fei’er, don’t—" The black-dressed woman began to chide her, but then she noticed the blush on Yin Shilan’s face and stopped.  

Ren Fei’er also realized something was amiss. She had only been teasing, but Yin Shilan’s reaction was anything but playful.  

"Lan’er, who is he?" the black-dressed woman asked.  

Her voice carried a peculiar charm, infused with spiritual power.  

"It’s—" Yin Shilan began to answer but abruptly stopped, shooting her mother a reproachful look.  

"Mother! How could you use 'Demonic Sound Infiltration' on me?" she exclaimed, nearly falling for the trick.  

The black-dressed woman chuckled triumphantly. Though she hadn’t gotten a name, she was now certain—her daughter had indeed found someone special.
