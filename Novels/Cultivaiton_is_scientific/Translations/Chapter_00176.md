# Chapter 176: Rebuilding  

"Does my current condition count as normal?" Li Shiming murmured to himself after sensing the state of his spiritual lake.  

He felt no joy or pride about advancing to Foundation Establishment without using a Foundation Establishment Pill—was he someone who lacked such pills?  

The biggest concern now was whether the "Five Elements Absorption Array" in his spiritual lake would affect his future cultivation of the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique."  

The "Five Elements Absorption Array" no longer drove the "Five Elements Absorption Technique." After all, the latter was merely a Qi Refining stage technique. Once he reached Foundation Establishment, the technique's ability to absorb spiritual energy could no longer meet the demands of his spiritual lake.  

Li Shiming focused his mind on his spiritual lake and finally sensed the condition of the five nodes in the "Five Elements Absorption Array."  

The five nodes carried a familiar aura—they were the Five Elements energies from the second-grade Ironwood, Green Crystal, Flame Crystal, Earthstone, and Petrified Iron.  

Through the external "Five Elements Absorption Array," he had somehow transferred the Five Elements energies into his body, forming an internal "Five Elements Absorption Array."  

Fortunately, IBMz15 had recorded every detail of his cultivation since he began seclusion, allowing him to study the connections later.  

The amount of liquid spiritual power in his spiritual lake was relatively small, but when he channeled it, he was absolutely certain that it was far beyond what an ordinary early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator could achieve.  

He had interacted and even fought with early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators before, giving him a clear judgment of their spiritual power.  

Although his liquid spiritual power was meager in quantity, its quality matched that of a cultivator transitioning from early to mid-stage Foundation Establishment.  

Li Shiming couldn't help but think of the "Five Elements Absorption Array" again—was this its effect?  

The most urgent matter now was to test the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique" and see if the "Five Elements Absorption Array" would interfere with it. If it did, his future cultivation would face significant challenges.  

Upon reaching Foundation Establishment, the Foundation Establishment chapter of the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique" became fully accessible to him, no longer obscured like before.  

The "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique" cultivated thunder spiritual power. Depending on one's spiritual attributes, one could choose to cultivate thunder spiritual power of a single element or multiple elements.  

Li Shiming's heart stirred—since he now possessed all five elemental spiritual powers, could he attempt to cultivate thunder spiritual power of all five elements simultaneously?  

But first, he needed to absorb spiritual energy into his body.  

---  

The "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique" lived up to its reputation as a top-tier cultivation method—its foundation required Foundation Establishment.  

Even with his physique, Li Shiming felt a stinging pain in his meridians during his first attempt to circulate the technique.  

He had no idea that top-tier techniques demanded specific qualifications and couldn't be casually practiced by anyone.  

The primary requirement of the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique" was physique—its cultivation placed immense strain on the body. A weaker physique couldn't withstand its rapid absorption and circulation of spiritual energy.  

Li Shiming's monstrous physique was the only reason he met the technique's requirements.  

Normally, a Foundation Establishment cultivator wishing to practice the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique" would first need to master a body-refining technique before even attempting it.  

The fact that a Foundation Establishment cultivator's body, already transformed during the breakthrough, still required body-refining mastery spoke volumes about the technique's demands.  

But high demands came with high rewards. Amid the stinging pain in his meridians, vast amounts of metal-attribute spiritual energy surged into his body, rapidly converting into liquid metal-attribute thunder spiritual power under the technique's circulation.  

Once this liquid metal-attribute thunder spiritual power entered his spiritual lake, it was first refined by the "Five Elements Absorption Array," transforming into the purest Five Elements thunder spiritual power achievable at early-stage Foundation Establishment.  

Only then did Li Shiming finally relax. It seemed the "Five Elements Absorption Array" could refine thunder spiritual power without altering its nature—it merely enhanced its elemental properties.  

Though the quantity of Five Elements thunder spiritual power generated in a single session was relatively small, its quality reached the peak of early-stage Foundation Establishment.  

Li Shiming extended a finger, and a thread of metal-attribute thunder spiritual power danced on its tip. He then switched it to wood-attribute thunder spiritual power, cycling through all five elemental thunder spiritual powers in turn.  

According to the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique" and his own observations:  
- Metal-attribute thunder spiritual power boasted the strongest offensive capabilities, especially against metal-based spiritual objects.  
- Wood-attribute thunder spiritual power was unique—it excelled against yin-cold energies and could even produce rare healing effects, switching between offense and recovery at will.  
- Water-attribute thunder spiritual power was the most insidious, capable of lingering in the environment before erupting explosively.  
- Fire-attribute thunder spiritual power was the most violent, with splash and explosive effects upon impact.  
- Earth-attribute thunder spiritual power was the most resilient, accumulating over time to unleash a devastating strike.  

The practical application of Five Elements thunder spiritual power depended on the combat environment. Most thunder cultivators mastered only one or two attributes, which sufficed for many battles. With all five, Li Shiming could adapt to any situation.  

---  

IBMz15 then provided an analysis report based on his cultivation with the "Five Elements Absorption Array."  

Drawing from all his current knowledge of cultivation—including the Wei Clan's library—the report concluded:  

The "Five Elements Absorption Array" would greatly aid his Foundation Establishment journey, granting his spiritual power Five Elements attributes while maintaining the purest state for his realm.  

These benefits would allow him to break through directly once his spiritual power accumulated sufficiently, unlike other cultivators who needed extensive time compressing and purifying their spiritual power.  

However, drawbacks existed. The current "Five Elements Absorption Array" relied on second-grade Five Elements materials, limiting its use to Foundation Establishment.  

According to IBMz15, advancing to Golden Core would require:  
1. Meeting spiritual power standards.  
2. Sufficient breakthrough resources.  
3. A set of third-grade Five Elements materials.  

Li Shiming's head throbbed at the thought.  

The second-grade materials had already been a struggle—Elder Yu had nearly exploded in anger when he requested them. Without the life-or-death tournament, he wouldn't have obtained them.  

If second-grade materials were this troublesome, third-grade seemed like a pipe dream.  

Third-grade materials were typically accessible only to Golden Core cultivators.  

"If only I had a Golden Core elder backing me... Wait, I do—but Elder Yin probably can't provide third-grade materials either!" Li Shiming sighed.  

His best bet was to join a major sect, leverage his status as a high-level array master to access materials, and then acquire a set—whether by theft, force, or deception.  

"Wait—does this mean I'll need fourth-grade materials later too?" His expression darkened further as he realized he'd dug himself into an ever-deepening pit.  

"Let's cross that bridge when we come to it," he muttered, shelving the thought for now.  

---  

Li Shiming retrieved nine flying sword artifacts. Now that he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he could finally wield them.  

Though his spiritual power was limited, refining artifacts was feasible.  

Most new Foundation Establishment cultivators prioritized refining a defensive artifact if possible.  

But as a high-level array master, Li Shiming had long coveted these nine flying swords—they doubled as array flags.  

He no longer needed the "Dragon-Dotting Technique" for refinement. Instead, he used the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique's" refinement method, which included applications for attack, control, healing, and refinement—expanding as his cultivation deepened.  

Channeling metal thunder spiritual power, he tapped the central sword. Golden lightning enveloped the blade, forging a spiritual connection.  

The central sword was the master artifact of the set. Refining it granted him a spiritual link not only to it but also to the other eight swords—a perk of matched artifacts.  

The "Nine Palaces Sword Array" was the set's name. Even with the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique's" efficiency, full refinement required multiple sessions.  

This first session achieved 10% refinement. Nine more would complete the process.  

At 10%, Li Shiming could already wield the central sword as a flying sword, though its control and power weren't yet at their peak—adequate for practice.  

His current spiritual power couldn't sustain full control of all nine swords, requiring further accumulation.  

His spiritual sense, however, met the requirements. Under the "Sword Control Technique," the central sword danced through the cave.  

Now at Foundation Establishment, his "Sword Control Technique" felt outdated. Without an advanced version, he needed a new sword-control method.  

His previously stagnant sword intent had nearly doubled—likely due to his breakthrough. Sword intent was too advanced for Qi Refining; Foundation Establishment was the baseline.  

He estimated that once the "Nine Palaces Sword Array" was fully refined, his current sword intent could shatter an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator's spiritual imprint within five strikes.  

Crucially, he sensed his sword intent could be replicated in his clone.  

Shifting half his consciousness to the clone, he was instantly struck by weakness—both physical and spiritual.  

The contrast was stark. His main body was now Foundation Establishment, while the clone, though physically strong and spiritually perceptive, paled in comparison.  

After adjusting, he tested the clone's sword intent with the Gold Strike Sword.  

Infusing his sword intent into the technique, the blade carried a faint trace—not as strong as his main body's, but it would develop further after Foundation Establishment.  

"Friend, the next step is yours," the main body said, rising and handing seven Foundation Establishment Pills to the clone.  

"Friend, I likely won't need this many," the clone replied with a smile.  

Li Shiming didn't plan to use the "Five Elements Absorption Array" for the clone. In Northern Shu, obtaining second-grade Five Elements materials quickly was impossible—he'd barely secured an upper-grade spiritual vein by force.  

Moreover, he wasn't sure if the "Five Elements Absorption Array" was a trap. One victim was enough; no need to drag the clone into it.  

The clone would follow the standard breakthrough path.  

Seated atop the spiritual vein's outlet, the clone activated the "Five Elements Absorption Technique," forcing spiritual energy into its spiritual vortex.  

The clone had long been at peak Qi Refining. If not for aiding the main body, it would have broken through earlier.  

Few Heaven-grade spiritual root holders would delay their breakthrough after maxing out spiritual power, spiritual sense, and physique.  

A surge of spiritual energy triggered the vortex's collapse into a spiritual lake.  

Energy flowed through the clone's body during the transformation, enhancing its physique and soul to Foundation Establishment standards.  

Li Shiming checked the time—IBMz15 recorded the breakthrough at 31 seconds.  

The clone's suppressed state had allowed it to break through with a single spiritual energy infusion—no pills, no prolonged wait.  

Li Shiming shook his head. This was the disparity in innate talent.  

His main body had taken three months, left with uncertain consequences, while the clone breezed through effortlessly.
