# Apologies, Everyone

Ahem~

Due to some synchronization issues between the author's PC and web versions of the writing assistant when publishing chapters, there were discrepancies in the chapter names and order for the first three chapters. However, the content itself remains coherent.

The relevant chapter content has been updated. If any esteemed readers encounter duplicate chapters, simply refresh the page!

Also, I've managed to secure another chapter recommendation—*chuckles*—

For those interested, feel free to check it out!

**Title:** *Contending for Immortality*  

**Synopsis:**  

Upon waking up, Lu Ming found himself transmigrated into a terrifying world where immortals, demons, and monsters stood in a three-way stalemate, yet the path to ascension was nearly monopolized by immortal clans.  

For common disciples, seeking immortality was akin to a blade of grass attempting to defy the heavens.  

Only those with supreme wisdom, unyielding perseverance, and unparalleled courage could hope to succeed.  

"Fortunately, while I may lack supreme wisdom, I am undoubtedly a supreme cheat."  

Any cultivation technique he practiced, as long as he persisted and maxed out its proficiency, would grant him corresponding abilities.  

**[Genius Cultivator]:** Cultivation speed +1000%.  
**[Master of Four Arts]:** Success rate in crafting "formations, pills, talismans, and artifacts" +100%.  
**[Purity Unblemished]:** Immune to all corrupting or toxic influences.  
**[First Strike]:** First attack accuracy +100%.  
**[Counter Strike]:** Subsequent attack accuracy +100%.  

"The path to immortality is like a thousand armies vying to cross a single log bridge—a single misstep means becoming a handful of dust."  

"So even if I die, I'll die on the road to immortality!"
