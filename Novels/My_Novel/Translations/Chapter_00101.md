Chapter 101: Digesting the Spirit Treasure, the Mistress Summons

Li Xian saw a cave, its entrance pitch black, with two arms' worth of width.

"So this is where the Crab Treasure was trying to escape back to?"

Li Xian broke off a tree branch and thrust it deep into the洞. Before long, the branch was crushed to pieces.

"There's more than one Red Mountain Crab in that cave."

"I'll mark this place. It'll be much easier to come back and catch crabs later."

"It's a shame there's no water nearby. If I brought my iron pot, I could cook right here. Wouldn't that be wonderful?"

Li Xian sighed to himself and returned to Black River Village.

On the way, he dug up the wild boar and mountain monkey he had hunted. He slung the monkey over his shoulder and carried the boar in his right hand.

Li Xian didn't like eating monkey meat, so he gave the mountain monkey to the villagers, asking them to cook a pot of mountain monkey and yellow millet porridge.

He took the wild boar home.

"I was hoping to hunt a tiger."

"Ah well, since you insisted on offering yourself up, I'll eat you first. Hunting a tiger can wait."

Li Xian patted the wild boar.

The meat was firm. Wild boars were highly reproductive, common in the mountains, and very aggressive.

Before his father passed away, the two of them had been attacked by wild boars many times while hunting in the mountains. There was one benefit to being a hunter: the master of the house would occasionally reward them with some game meat to eat.

It was usually wild boar meat.

"Wild boar meat is quite gamey, but we held our noses and ate it anyway."

Roasting it over a high flame made the skin glisten with oil, and the smell of charcoal could effectively mask the earthy odor. Adding a few seasonings made it a satisfying meal.

Li Xian ate with an open appetite, consuming over ten pounds of meat. Even with his [Devouring] skill, he was quite full.

[Skill: Devouring]
[Proficiency: 689/1000 (Proficient)]

Lately, he had been eating nothing but mountain delicacies, and his Devouring proficiency had increased rapidly.

After eating and drinking his fill and recovering his energy, Li Xian slung the black pot over his back and went to the stream to boil the spirit food.

With the experience from last time, he first chopped a sufficient amount of firewood and piled it to the side. Then he started a fire and drew water...

Once the water was boiling, he threw the four Crab Treasures into the pot. The mountain crabs began to thrash violently as soon as they entered.

Li Xian put the lid on and weighed it down with a rock.

"So resilient. They've been boiled for so long and they're still not dead."

Li Xian clicked his tongue, adding firewood to the fire as he mentally kept time. Every quarter of an hour, he would open the lid and pour in cold water.

Black smoke drifted into the air...

Since it was night, no one could see it. And deep in the mountains, there were very few people. As a guard, he wasn't worried about anyone catching him gathering firewood.

Waiting for the spirit soup to be ready was a long and boring process.

Li Xian didn't want to waste time, so he practiced martial arts nearby. The Great Luo Saber was a large, sweeping style that required a wide stance, making it unsuitable for practice in the forest.

It was better to practice the "Jade Green Palm."

As a first-class palm technique, it was truly extraordinary. When Li Xian practiced the Jade Green Palm, he could clearly feel that the technique was more complete.

The growth of his Qi was also significant.

The Jade Green Palm had several killing moves. One move, "Jade Green Entanglement," focused on extreme speed, like drawing a saber from its sheath. When it hit a person, it left an inescapable palm print.

This was the very palm technique that had struck Zhao Han and the others.

Another move, "Overturning Rivers and Seas," had a powerful palm force. Qi surged forth, capable of blasting a person several zhang away.

Li Xian practiced diligently, move by move, steadily accumulating proficiency.

This was his routine: practice martial arts, add water, add firewood, then practice again...

Round and round.

"No wonder the Mistress hires so many servants."

"If I ever open my own manor to teach martial arts, I'll need to hire more servants too. Otherwise, I'd never be able to manage it all."

Li Xian wiped the sweat from his brow. Doing everything himself was truly exhausting.

He lifted the wooden lid.

The mountain crabs had finally died, but it was clear they still needed more time to be boiled into soup.

So he continued to add firewood and water.

Li Xian could clearly feel that the fire from the firewood was insufficient. Every time he added cold water, it took a considerable amount of time to bring it back to a boil. That was where all the time was being spent.

"These mountain crabs are only the lowest level of demons, yet they require so much effort."

"They say a clever wife can't cook without rice."

"A martial artist, on the other hand, can't cook without a pot, rice, firewood, or water."

Li Xian sighed. But he still had to do what needed to be done, repeating the process over and over. By the time the sky began to lighten in the east, farm women were starting to come up the mountain to fetch water.

"Master Li, what are you cooking over there?" one of the women asked curiously.

"Nothing. You all just go about your business," Li Xian said, waving his hand.

The woman didn't dare to disturb Li Xian further. After fetching her water, she told the others not to go up the mountain lightly.

This suited Li Xian just fine, as it gave him some peace and quiet.

"There's one more crab this time, so it's taking much longer."

Just as he was about to finish, he suddenly saw a crack forming at the bottom of the pot, threatening to split open. Li Xian's heart lurched. "I was so focused on boiling the spirit food as quickly as possible, I forgot this pot is of average quality. With this constant cycle of hot and cold, it's a miracle it hasn't broken already!"

Heartbroken at the thought of losing the spirit treasure, he acted in a moment of panic and used his bare hands to plug the crack. With a sizzling sound, his hand was scalded. Li Xian activated his Qi to resist the heat, but the pain was still unbearable.

"Quick, bring me another pot!" Li Xian shouted toward the village.

His Qi was quite formidable, and his shout echoed through the entire village. Uncle Fu was startled and immediately had the village men grab iron pots, blades, iron nets, and other tools.

They rushed up the mountain in a group to support him.

They thought a powerful enemy was attacking.

But when they arrived, they saw no such enemy. Li Xian asked for a large pot and said, "You can all go down now."

He offered no further explanation, just let out a huge sigh of relief.

"There are so many tricks to boiling spirit food."

Li Xian patted his chest, feeling a bit of lingering fear. After changing the pot, he boiled it for another three hours, and finally, the pot of spirit soup was ready.

He lifted the lid.

A milky-white soup was before him, much thicker than the last time. Li Xian's heart swelled with excitement. He pried open the crab shell and scooped out the crab fat with his fingers.

He swallowed it down.

[You have consumed an inferior spirit food, Proficiency +16]

Threads of heaven and earth's essence flowed from his abdomen.

Li Xian cycled his Qi through his meridians and sealed his blood and pores. Layer upon layer of barriers was set up, all to retain the essence.

But he saw that the heaven and earth's essence was truly wild and untamable. The more he tried to hold it, the more it resisted.

Cycling Qi through the meridians was like a great river protecting the city. The essence强行 forced its way through. Sealing blood and pores was like a towering city wall. The essence simply leaped over the walls and slipped through the cracks.

In the end, it still managed to disperse.

Li Xian was not discouraged.

He had held onto the essence for longer this time!

Wherever the essence had passed, a cool sensation lingered.

"It really works."

"And... cycling Qi is more effective than sealing blood and pores. The more abundant my Qi, the stronger the threads of Qi that circle my acupoints."

"The longer I can intercept the heaven and earth's essence!"

Li Xian's eyes shone brightly.

He wasn't afraid of failure, only of not making progress. Seeing a glimmer of hope, he devoted himself wholeheartedly, moving坚定不移ly in that direction.

He pried open the second Crab Treasure.

This one had very little fat, only a tiny bit, the size of a fingernail.

"Even a second-rate martial artist would probably scorn such a small amount of spirit treasure."

"But for me, even a mosquito's leg is meat..."

Li Xian gave a self-deprecating smile. He swallowed the tiny bit of crab fat. Thanks to the enhancement from [Devouring], a faint trace of heaven and earth's essence barely emerged.

He ran his entire internal Qi through his meridians.

This time, he managed to hold it for a full ten breaths. He clearly felt this thread of essence being intercepted by his Qi, darting left and right, changing directions several times before finally slipping out of his flesh through his pores.

The third crab was the same.

Until the fourth crab...

A "Crab General" the size of three fists.

"Don't let me down!"

Li Xian pried open the crab shell, hoping for more fat. When he saw a large chunk of crab fat, his wish was fulfilled, and he broke into a joyful smile.

"A Crab General!"

"The amount of fat on this one is much more than the three small crabs combined!"

He swallowed it down.

This crab fat contained about ten threads of heaven and earth's essence. After being strengthened by Devouring, it turned into fourteen threads.

Like unruly children who wouldn't listen, they scattered all at once, darting chaotically to every part of his body.

Three threads of essence were incredibly fast, escaping his Qi cycle and bypassing his sealed pores in the blink of an eye, dissipating into the world.

The remaining eleven threads "battled" with Li Xian for a good while. They tried to break through his "defenses," but it wasn't so easy.

"Whoosh..."

Several more threads of essence强行 broke through the encirclement and dispersed.

Only six were left...

"I'll hold onto these six threads of essence for as long as I can!" Li Xian clenched his fists, gritted his teeth, and circulated his entire internal Qi.

His blood was as solid as stone, his pores as sealed as jade.

He sat there motionless, like a stone statue.

"There goes another one..."

During the struggle, another thread of essence slipped away.

Li Xian had no idea that this struggle between him and the heaven and earth's essence was known as "Body Cleansing."

A martial artist fights against the heavens, the earth, and other people.

Forcibly retaining heaven and earth's essence... was to act against the natural order. The longer the essence remained in his body, the more of his "mud body" was washed away.

Little by little...

Eventually, one day, his mud body would show signs of transcending the mortal. That was the sign of "Immortal Opportunity in the Palm."

"Ah!"

Li Xian let out a heavy sigh as four more threads of essence drifted away together.

After all that effort consuming the spirit treasure, was it all for nothing in the end?

"Forget it, forget it."

"I'll just go catch some more mountain crabs in a few days."

Li Xian was about to get up when his eyes suddenly widened in shock.

He felt... a thread of essence that should have already drifted away was blocked by his sealed pores and, inexplicably, burrowed back deeper into his body.

"Could it be... could it be..."

A strong premonition rose within Li Xian. He focused all his attention on capturing this thread of essence.

A quarter of an hour...

Two quarter of an hour...

This wild and untamable thread of essence, now without any companions, charged at his defenses again and again, as if it was gradually tiring.

Its frantic darting slowed down.

Finally, it lay still in one spot, no longer moving. Li Xian didn't dare to be negligent and continued to cycle his Qi without pause.

It wasn't until the sky darkened that he came back to himself with a start...

He had...

Managed to retain a thread of heaven and earth's essence!

"This broken, leaky mud body of mine, with holes on all sides... has actually managed to hold onto a thread of essence?!"

Li Xian stood up.

His eyes shone with an inextinguishable light. Although it was only as thin as a hair, almost unnoticeable, and the growth it brought was minuscule, this step forward was of immense significance.

It was no less than telling him that the "First Realm of Martial Arts" was no longer an untouchable distant dream.

He had found a direction! A correct direction, and he had taken a step forward.

That thread of essence was gradually absorbed by his flesh and blood.

Li Xian's mud body trembled for the first time, shaking off a little bit of mud and dust.

Martial artists who undergo a complete transformation consume heaven and earth's essence, striving for transcendence.

And today, Li Xian had experienced a tiny taste of it. This收获 was enough to fill him with joy.

The next day.

It was still early morning.

A B-rank guard from the Yihe Manor arrived at Black River Village and called out to the village: "Li Xian, the Mistress summons you back to the manor!"
