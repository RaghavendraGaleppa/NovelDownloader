# Chapter 419: Overwhelming Supremacy

The clouds to the east were shredded by ten thousand sword intents as twenty-four cultivators, each carrying a sword case on their back, formed a sword formation.

The leading woman in white lightly traced with her sword finger, and a mighty sword song surged through the sea of clouds.

The moment the Twenty-Four Solar Terms Sword Formation of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect appeared, a clear and resonant sword cry rang out across the entire sky.

The moment the three forces clashed, the periphery of the Suspended Mountain exploded with a sky full of spiritual light.

Although the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect usually engaged in infighting, they now tacitly formed the Three Talismans Demonic Sudden Array.

The seven disciples of the Seven Kill Peak suddenly disintegrated into blood, painting the "True Form of the Seven Kill Blood Demon" in the air, sweeping the first six charging sword cultivators into a sea of blood.

The female sword cultivator in white let out a delicate shout. Her personal flying sword, "Awakening Insects," burst with a piercing green light, actually splitting the blood sea open by a hundred zhang.

Xu Yunfan glanced at this but didn't pay much attention to it.

The sword art was decent, but it still lacked something.

Since he had caught the eye of Hundred Peaks True Lord, and even the attention of the True Lord behind him, Xu Yunfan naturally had to show his worth. This was the moment to prove himself.

If anything went wrong, while he might not face a life-threatening crisis, there was also the possibility that Hundred Peaks True Lord, in his anger, might just slap him to death.

In the Primordial Origin Sect, all those below the Foundation Establishment realm were mere consumables.

Under a Foundation Establishment True Lord, it wouldn't raise any eyebrows even if a hundred Qi Condensation disciples were killed.

"Seeking death!"

Xu Yunfan had just landed on the mountainside ruins when a sharp whistling sound reached his ears.

That female sword cultivator had somehow broken through the encirclement, her sword tip already piercing to within three inches of his throat.

The pure yang sword intent bursting from the sword tip instantly melted the broken stele beneath his feet into a glass-like state.

"Clang!"

The Xuanwu Suppressing Demon Seal, refined from Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil, automatically protected its master.龟甲纹路 (Turtle shell patterns) surfaced on Xu Yunfan's skin.

His right hand formed a claw and reached out. A vast true energy condensed into a vortex in his palm.

The female sword cultivator discovered in horror that her personal flying sword was actually being forcibly clamped. The sword body emitted a groan as if unable to bear the strain.

Xu Yunfan's left hand formed a fist and struck out. The Suppressing Demon Earthly Evil energy transformed into a ferocious dragon head, piercing a bowl-sized hole through the woman's chest and abdomen.

"You..."

The woman looked down in disbelief, watching her true energy wildly dissipate as Xu Yunfan slowly withdrew his fist, drifting towards his body.

"You are a human demon. Let me, the True Martial, suppress the demon. Demon, receive your judgment."

Hearing Xu Yunfan's cold voice, an absurd feeling arose in the female sword cultivator's heart.

明明 (Míngmíng - Clearly), the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect was the leader of the Righteous Path. She was the disciple of the Righteous Path. These words should have been spoken by her!

As her true energy was rapidly devoured by Xu Yunfan using the Demon Devouring method and integrated into his spine to forge the True Martial Millstone, the phantom of a turtle and snake coiled behind him. It quickly ground the opponent's true energy to dust, transforming it into a pure stream of true energy that merged with the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil energy.

"Amitabha!"

A Buddhist chant exploded like thunder. Xu Yunfan suddenly felt the air around him solidify.

Nine muscular, burly monks descended from the sky. When they landed, they actually sank the ground within a ten-zhang radius by three feet.

The leading monk's vertical eye on his forehead opened in fury. A Demon-subduing Pestle in his hand was entwined with eighteen dragon-shaped auras.

The monk had clearly seen Xu Yunfan casually punch the female sword cultivator to death just moments ago.

He recognized that woman. She belonged to the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and was a disciple with exceptional talent. During the previous Buddhist-Dao debate, he had even exchanged a few words with her, leaving a deep impression.

"Demon! Why don't you quickly convert to my Buddha!"

The vertical-eyed monk spat out true words. Each word condensed into a golden shackle in the air. "Become a guardian Vajra of my Pure Land, and you can avoid having your soul scattered and destroyed!"

Yuanzhen was extremely solemn in his heart. Although Xu Yunfan's aura hadn't been fully released, the pure punching power he had shown just by his出手 (chūshǒu - move/hand) was enough to reveal his terrifying physique.

He was likely a Body Cultivator.

But his Bodhi Pure Land was famous across all realms for its indestructible golden body. The supreme martial art of the Dragon Elephant Temple within his Pure Land, the "Dragon Elephant Suppressing Hell Sutra," could, when cultivated to perfection, allow one to achieve sainthood with the physical body and power to break all laws.

Legend has it that in the ancient era, the Dragon Elephant Bodhisattva once manifested a ten-thousand-zhang golden body, supporting a minor thousand-world with a single arm. Its might shook the heavens and earth, and it remains to this day a symbol of supreme power in Buddhism.

"Guardian Vajra?"

Xu Yunfan suddenly laughed.

This was the second time since leaving the Divine Martial Realm that someone had tried to convert him.

It was somewhat nostalgic.

He lightly tapped with the tip of his foot. The True Martial Heavenly Gang gushed out from his seven orifices, condensing behind him into a Xuanwu Dao Appearance coiled by a turtle and snake.

The monk was greatly alarmed upon seeing this. A converting golden light shot out from his vertical eye, but was swallowed by the snake head of the Dao Appearance.

"Trivial Buddhist art."

Xu Yunfan's right fist slowly pulled back. The muscles and tendons on his entire arm bulged. Each muscle looked like a steel wire being slowly pulled taut.

The remaining spiritual energy of the Suspended Mountain suddenly boiled, transforming into ten thousand light spots that converged onto his fist.

When the fist struck out, a violent shockwave rolled like an angry dragon. The air along its path was squeezed into visible distorted ripples, exploding into circles of milky white sonic booms.

With a single punch, wherever the fist wind passed, the air exploded like thunder. The air within a hundred zhang radius was forcibly blasted apart, forming visible shockwave ripples.

"Boom!"

The Arhat Formation formed by the nine burly monks shattered as if made of paper.

The vertical-eyed monk's golden body first revealed spider-web-like cracks, then burst with green light from within.

He looked at his own body turning into glass in disbelief. The last thing he heard was Xu Yunfan's cold sneer: "You bald donkeys. If you were in the Divine Martial Realm, you wouldn't even qualify to be my door guards."

Before the words faded, Xu Yunfan suddenly froze. He felt as if a pair of eyes had pierced through the void, scrutinizing him from flesh to soul.

What the hell?!

Is there a True Lord watching him?!

The remaining shockwave of the fist swept across a hundred zhang, sending the disciples of the three forces, who were still fighting, flying.

Three sword cultivators from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect couldn't dodge in time. When the leaking Suppressing Demon Earthly Evil energy touched the hems of their clothes, they exploded from their feet instantly.

The Bodhi Pure Land side suffered even more. The eighteen monks in the formation were blown to pieces of flesh and blood by the backlash of Buddhist power.

At this moment, after just a few punches from Xu Yunfan, the eighteen monks in the formation were blasted into a bloody mess. This scene left everyone present in a death-like shock.

The male-female-looking disciple from the Hundred Desires Peak of the Primordial Origin Sect widened his eyes, his lips trembling as he roared in his heart: "This... this is impossible?! Is he really at the Qi Condensation stage?!"

In the distance, several sword cultivators from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect were pale-faced, their hands holding the swords trembling slightly.

They had just witnessed with their own eyes Xu Yunfan shatter a Buddhist golden body with a single punch. That violent power was not something a Qi Condensation cultivator could possess!

"Foundation Establishment... he is definitely a Foundation Establishment True Lord!" a sword cultivator roared in a low voice, his eyes full of disbelief. "But with a Golden Core True Lord present, how could a Foundation Establishment cultivator have slipped in?!"

The remaining few monks from the Bodhi Pure Land were also mentally shaken. One of them even fell to the ground, muttering: "This person... this person is definitely not at Qi Condensation! His physical power is comparable to the reincarnation of the Dragon Elephant Bodhisattva. How could he still not have reached Foundation Establishment?!"

Even the other disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect were terrified. Although they knew Xu Yunfan's strength was extraordinary, the combat power he displayed now far exceeded their understanding.
