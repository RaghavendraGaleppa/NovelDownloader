# Chapter 71: The Immortal Body Rejects Internal Qi, Beyond Divine Art? Departure for the Nine Peaks Tournament (1/2)

Half an hour later.

Li Mo looked at the freshly created *Fire Lotus Extreme Yang Qi* in his hands, lost in thought.

This was a supreme technique.

With the foundation of the Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method and ten years of martial arts comprehension, he had effortlessly mastered it to perfection.

A top-tier cultivation method had become a supreme technique; the difference was visibly distinct.

However...

The fluctuations from the thirty-six Lotus Seeds were much stronger, yet there was still no sign of them taking root or sprouting.

"I refuse to believe this."

Li Mo took out another bottle of Ten Thousand Year Ancient Vein Spiritual Milk, pulled the stopper, and took a large gulp.

Instantly, his Dantian and meridians felt a sensation of swelling.

He circulated the *Fire Lotus Extreme Yang Qi* with all his might. Each Lotus Seed seemed to turn into a pump, frantically swallowing the Ancient Vein Essence.

A quarter of an hour later.

In his Dantian, a wisp of fire color actually appeared.

"Internal Qi!?"

Before Li Mo could feel joy.

In an instant.

The newly born Internal Qi vanished into nothingness.

It was as if it had been swallowed by an invisible abyss, leaving no trace.

He was completely baffled.

It was already difficult enough to condense Internal Qi, but now that he had condensed it, it disappeared?

"This is bizarre."

"I can't break through even with a supreme technique?"

"Am I going to be stuck at the Blood Qi Realm for the rest of my life?"

Li Mo opened his eyes and stopped circulating his technique, his face filled with doubt in life.

He forced himself to calm down and think.

The techniques derived from the Ancient Bronze Heavenly Book Seal were definitely flawless.

So the problem had to be with him.

"The Xuanpin Immortal Body?"

A spark of inspiration flashed through Li Mo's mind, and he muttered to himself.

Although he had possessed the Immortal Body for a long time, he knew very little about it.

When he went to the Scripture Pavilion, he had翻阅翻阅 some strange tales and legends, but he had never found any records regarding it.

But thinking it over and over again.

He couldn't find any other reason besides the Immortal Body.

"The thirty-six Lotus Seeds are difficult to condense Internal Qi through supreme techniques, and moreover..."

"My body cannot accommodate Internal Qi."

He summarized these two issues.

Li Mo fell into deep thought again.

What should he do?

After much consideration, he thought of two methods that might be reliable.

First, scatter his cultivation and start over. This time, don't open all thirty-six main meridians; instead, like ordinary people, only open twelve main meridians.

Second, wait for a higher-grade Silver Heavenly Book Seal.

With a Silver Heavenly Book Seal, he could turn a supreme technique into a Divine Art.

Furthermore.

He still had a Gilded Heavenly Book Seal, which could even elevate the *Fire Lotus Extreme Yang Qi* by another rank, allowing this martial art to reach...

Beyond Divine Art!

The Great Circulation of the Thirty-Six Meridian Blood Qi Cycle was powerful.

After entering the Internal Qi Realm, it was even more unimaginable.

"Since I've already opened them."

"I shall carry it through to the end."

Li Mo hesitated for only three and a third seconds before making his choice.

Wait!

I have the Ice Cube and Princess Jiang Chulong; a mere Silver Heavenly Book Seal is nothing.

It is just around the corner.

Returning to Autumn Water Pavilion.

The leaves in the courtyard had stopped swaying, covered in patches of white frost, weighed down and unable to lift their heads.

Tonight's Autumn Water Pavilion was unusually cold; walking in felt like instantly traveling to the depth of winter, where water freezes upon hitting the ground.

Inside a certain Ice Cube's room.

An astonishing chill was emanating, along with wisps of misty multicolored light.

"She said tonight, so it is tonight."

"Tomorrow, she will be in the Internal Qi Realm."

Li Mo sighed with emotion and returned to the隔壁 room.

The cold wasn't unbearable.

It was just that his bed was against the wall, and the bedding had frozen solid.

Suddenly, he felt a sensation.

It was the World Seed transmitting a fluctuation.

"Jiang Chulong is quite punctual every day."

Li Mo lay on the bed, resting his body, while his consciousness entered the World Seed.

...

"Te... Teacher!"

Jiang Chulong obediently sat in a duck-styled posture in front of the stone table.

Seeing a figure walking over holding a 'textbook', her little face immediately bloomed with a careful smile.

Li Mo sat down in front of the table with an air of ease and casually brewed some tea.

---

He brewed the tea but didn't drink it, looking up as he said:

"Cough, have you fully comprehended what was taught last time?"

"Mm-hmm!"

Jiang Chulong nodded vigorously like a pecking chick.

She was super serious.

The Heavenly尊 Teacher's requirements were high; she was afraid of not meeting them and making the teacher unhappy.

Even when she went out to pick up trash every day, she would swing a branch around a couple of times.

"Good, then regarding your confusion from last time, let me explain it to you."

The Heavenly尊大人 opened the textbook.

This textbook was passionately provided by the Ice Cube and revised by Student Li.

It was the only one of its kind in the world.

Jiang Chulong's talent for the Sword Dao was outrageous.

After these days of lectures, without teaching her a single Sword Art, she had perfected her self-created martial art to the upper-tier level.

And it was not far from becoming a supreme technique.

It was simply absurd.

This time, she was again like a sponge, absorbing all the Sword Dao knowledge Li Mo brought from the Ice Cube.

Midway, to keep up with her thinking, Li Mo even used his martial arts comprehension to understand the Sword Dao knowledge passed on by Ying Bing.

For Li Mo, this unpleasant lecture session ended.

"How is your recovery?"

"Al... Almost there," Jiang Chulong said, her fingers twisting together.

"Then let's strike while the iron is hot. The sooner you recover, the sooner you can start training," Li Mo said as he took out various medicinal supplements.

Once Jiang Chulong's body fully recovers, she should settle a pretty good reward, right?

Just as he was thinking this.

"Te... Teacher..."

"Hm?"

Li Mo looked up.

He found that Jiang Chulong across from him was biting her lips as if she wanted to say something, her fingers twisting together again, and a small expectation flickered in her gray-white eyes...

"What is it?"

"I... I want... to hear a story from the荒界 (Desolate Realm)."

"..."

After practicing last time, to motivate Princess Jiang Chulong, Li Mo had slightly polished a novel from his previous life and turned it into a legend to tell her.

It had to be said.

The novels he could remember, while being highly motivating...

Were also very good to read.

So, the small expectation flickering in Jiang Chulong's eyes simply wrote two words:

"Update."

"Alright then..."

...

The next day.

Shang Wu actually got up early.

In the small Autumn Water Pavilion, her serious voice echoed:

"For years, our Qunyu Peak has suffered repeated defeats, yet we fought on despite the losses, to the point where our morale was worn down and the Peak's prestige was lost. This situation must be completely reversed from today onwards."

"Little Bing'er, my precious disciple, we must compete with style, with confidence, and with results this time!"

"Restore the glory of Qunyu Peak, you two..."

Shang Wu clenched her fist, as if she could already see Qunyu Peak, under her leadership, returning to the top of the peaks.

A moment of silence.

Student Li glanced at the Ice Cube before raising his hand and saying:

"Master, let me ask, is there a possibility..."

"That Ying Bing is the Sect Master's true disciple?"

Shang Wu: "!"

Oh, right.

How could she forget that?

Her almond-shaped eyes immediately lost their luster.

"We're done for, I bet a lot of money..."

Li Mo: "..." "There's a betting pool in the Sect?"

So you're not only thinking about the Sect's rewards, but you're also planning to make some side money!

"That's called excitement. I bet on Qunyu Peak ranking first," Shang Wu said, looking as if she'd been frostbitten. She glanced at her disciple and shook her head.

"It's over, there's no hope."

Her precious disciple was still only at the Blood Qi Realm.

She had originally placed her hopes on Ying Bing, who had broken through to the Internal Qi Realm.

Li Mo said helplessly:

"Just by myself, it shouldn't make our Qunyu Peak's ranking that bad, right?"

"It's useless. I bet on first place. Can you beat Little Bing'er?" Shang Wu shook her head again.

She was already calculating how to default on the debt.

Thus, the pre-tournament mobilization meeting at Autumn Water Pavilion ended hastily.

Old Ba at the gate arrived on time with the carriage.

"The two true disciples, it's time to go to the Main Peak!"
