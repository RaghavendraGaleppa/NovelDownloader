# Chapter 10: Fire Heart Gives Birth to the Lotus, Unity of Heaven and Man (1/2)

At the summit of Mount Qunyu.

"It seems Elder Qian has no intention of making my cheap master pay back the debt. He's just reminding her not to borrow anymore."

Li Mo looked at the furnishings on the summit, the corners of his mouth twitching slightly.

There was a simple wooden house, along with some broken walls and ruins.

That was it.

If he didn't know this was within the Qingyuan Sect, he would have thought a disaster beast had just attacked the place.

"Master? Master?"

Li Mo called out twice, but receiving no answer, he pushed open the wooden door.

The entire room was filled with the smell of alcohol.

He saw a woman lying on the bed, covered with a blanket, sleeping sprawled out with her limbs wide open. A glistening trail was faintly visible at the corner of her mouth.

"Master?"

"Mmm..."

The woman let out a lazy grunt like a sleeping pig, turned over, and continued to sleep.

Li Mo was helpless. He had to lean close to her ear and whisper:

"Elder Qian is here to collect the debt..."

The effect was immediate.

Shang Wu shot up abruptly, but when she saw Li Mo standing before her, her alert yet drunken eyes filled with confusion:

"Who are you?"

"I'm your disciple," Li Mo said helplessly.

"Disciple... oh, oh, I remember now."

Shang Wu scratched her head, seeming to recall something, though her almond eyes were still dazed. "What do you want from me?"

She was awake, but not fully.

Li Mo remained silent for a moment before saying, "Now that I've joined the sect, aren't you... supposed to teach me something?"

"That seems quite reasonable."

Shang Wu's bare shoulders were exposed, seemingly unaware of how unsightly her current posture was.

She stood up, her palace dress slipping down to reveal half a shoulder. Surprisingly, she was even a bit taller than Li Mo.

"I was thinking of teaching you something yesterday."

"But without alcohol, my memory is just not good."

She frowned, looking slightly troubled.

No sooner had she spoken than a "pop" was heard—the sound of a wine stopper being opened.

Shang Wu's nose twitched, and she immediately identified it like a connoisseur:

"Green Ant Brew? It's a special product from the Shili Slope Winery. It needs to be cellared for five years before the wine turns amber, which makes it good. Ten years is even rarer. Where did you get this?"

She took the wine jar from her unlucky disciple and drank deeply. The liquid flowed down her chest, outlining an astonishing curve.

Your memory isn't bad at all.

Li Mo couldn't bear to look.

Shang Wu wiped her mouth and said:

"I remember now. I made a bet with Old Ghost Hanhe yesterday."

"He actually said this old lady can't teach disciples. Could I tolerate that?"

Li Mo: "......"

What the other party said seemed to make sense.

No matter who you apprentice yourself to, you probably wouldn't receive a debt ledger.

"He only took in a Mu Fengxiao and dares to show off in front of me? I spit on that!"

"So, I made a bet with him."

"If the disciple of Mount Qunyu ranks higher in the next Nine Peaks Martial Gathering, he'll help me settle the debt with the Internal Affairs Hall."

"What if you lose?"

"Lose? As my disciple, can't you have a little confidence?"

As she spoke, Shang Wu turned around, rummaged through a box, and took out a booklet.

She said confidently:

"This is my unique mental technique. Within today, I'll guide you into the art."

Li Mo took the booklet and saw the name of this mental technique:

*Fire Heart Gives Birth to the Lotus Method*

It sounded quite impressive.

Besides, even the System evaluated Shang Wu as extremely powerful.

Well, with so many debts, she probably acquired them through her own ability.

To be able to owe the Internal Affairs Hall so much, with Elder Qian only able to vaguely remind her not to borrow more, that already says a lot!

Li Mo's mind settled slightly, and he opened the booklet.

After reading it, he asked:

"Master, there's a place I didn't quite understand..."

"Snore... snore..."

"Master?"

Li Mo looked up.

He discovered that his heartless beauty of a master had fallen asleep again at some point. The wine jar had been emptied by her at some point too.

She was completely drunk; he couldn't wake her even if he pushed her.

Sister, can you be a little more reliable?!

"......."

Li Mo was just covered in black lines.

[Investment successful. Investment: One jar of ten-year-old Green Ant Brew.]
[Reward settlement in progress...]
[Congratulations, Host. Reward: Ten Years of Martial Dao Comprehension!]

[Ten Years of Martial Dao Comprehension]: "Can be applied to any martial art, allowing the Host to gain ten years of proficiency in it."

Hmm?

Ten Years of Martial Dao Comprehension?

The realms of a martial art are divided into six stages: Initial Entry, Initial Familiarity, Small Success, Great Success, Perfection, and Transformation Realm.

Even for a common, low-level martial art in the Jianghu, few can reach Perfection, let alone the Transformation Realm.

For example, Li Dalong, his father. He practiced the *Catch the Wind Palm* for nearly twenty years and only barely reached Great Success.

Of course, this also has to do with an individual's talent.

---

"Not saying my talent is heaven-defying, but I'm at least clever."

Li Mo simply walked out of the room and sat down on the ground.

Thinking this, he poured all ten years of Martial Dao Comprehension into the *Fire Heart Gives Birth to the Lotus Method*.

[Ten Years of Martial Dao Comprehension, successfully infused.]
[In the first year, you carefully considered every word and phrase of the *Fire Heart Gives Birth to the Lotus Method* and began experimenting. You successfully entered the Initial Entry realm.]
[In the third year, you seemed to have an epiphany, discovered the窍门 (trick/key point) of this technique, and reached Initial Familiarity.]
[In the ninth year, your *Fire Heart Gives Birth to the Lotus Method* became increasingly proficient, reaching the Small Success realm.]
[In the tenth year, you seemed to touch upon a bottleneck, but ultimately, your foundation was insufficient.]

Instantly.

Countless images flooded Li Mo's mind. It was as if he had truly spent ten years meticulously studying the *Fire Heart Gives Birth to the Lotus Method*, practicing it to the Small Success realm.

"Hoo..."

"Ten years, Small Success."

The feeling of suddenly comprehending the Dao made Li Mo feel as if he were soaring among the clouds.

He couldn't wait and began his first practice session.

Within his Dantian, a thread of heat rose...

And the grass and trees all around him stirred without any wind.

"For the first practice, successfully opening the meridians counts as success."

Li Mo calmed his mind.

Inside the room.

The drunken Shang Wu's brow suddenly furrowed.

She mumbled:

"Unity of Heaven and Man?"

"Who has such good dog-shit luck..."

.......

Meanwhile, on the other side.

At the main peak of Qingyuan, the Martial Practice Hall.

Several elders stood by, each able to see the astonishment in the others' eyes.

What caused them such shock was the少女 (young girl) sitting not far away, with her five points facing the sky.

At this moment.

These old men, whose combined ages added up to five hundred, were all doubting their lives.

Doubting if the first half of their lives had been lived on a dog.

"One day to enter the realm?"

Xue Jing murmured in disbelief.

"More accurately, a quarter of an hour," Qian Bufan corrected, sighing with emotion. He turned and asked, "Hanhe, you also practiced the *Frost Seeking Origin Point*. How long did it take you back then?"

Hanhe's mouth twitched. After a long while, he replied:

"One month."

At the time, Hanhe was still young, just a youth who had recently entered the Qingyuan Sect. He still remembered that when he used one month to enter the realm and successfully opened his meridians, his master惊喜 (delightedly) called him a genius.

Compared to the little girl in front of them...

As the elders spoke, the hot air they exhaled instantly turned into ice crystals.

"Talents emerge from generation to generation. Our Qingyuan Sect is about to flourish," Xue Jing said solemnly.

His perception was extremely sharp.

When Ying Bing practiced, it seemed as if there was an endless supply of extreme Yin energy within her, surging continuously.

Even as the master of this power, she couldn't help but be injured by it.

Taking Yang-natured herbs or pills could offset a little of it.

It seemed the Pure Yang Pills he sold to Li Mo a few days ago had helped this little girl open her meridians.

*Hiss—*

A soft sound.

The cold wind seemed to form a vortex centered around Ying Bing.

"She... has打通 (opened) one meridian!" Hanhe widened his eyes.

He clearly sensed that the first major meridian within Ying Bing's body was now畅通无阻 (unobstructed).

"If that's the case, wouldn't she be able to open all twelve meridians in just a few days?"

This statement was only half correct.

Ying Bing could indeed open all twelve meridians in a few days.

But what she wanted to open was far more than just twelve?

The elders of the Qingyuan Sect were, after all, limited in their vision.

The human body is like a hidden treasure. The meridians that can serve as major ones are far more than twelve.

Of course, a martial artist at the Qi and Blood Realm, even if they know of their existence, cannot open them. It requires extremely proficient and microscopic control.

But for her, this was not a problem.

Ying Bing wanted to open twenty-four meridians, creating a great cycle within her body.

By then, when she enters the Inner Qi Realm, her power would be more than ten times stronger!

"Such a monster, we were truly painting a snake with feet," Xue Jing said with a wry smile.

The Sect Master is busy with affairs, so he specifically had the three of them to teach Ying Bing, answer her questions, and also avoid the situation where a single teacher might make mistakes due to their own habits.

Now it's unnecessary.

Watching Ying Bing practice, they felt they were full of mistakes.

"I'll leave this to you two. I'm going to Mount Qunyu."

"What are you going there for? It's unlucky."

As soon as this word was mentioned, Elder Hanhe let out a cold snort.

"Do you really have peace of mind letting Shang Wu teach her disciple?" Xue Jing tugged at his patchwork robe.

Qian Bufan took a deep breath:

"Senior Brother Xue, please go quickly. If you're late, I'm afraid it'll be too late."
