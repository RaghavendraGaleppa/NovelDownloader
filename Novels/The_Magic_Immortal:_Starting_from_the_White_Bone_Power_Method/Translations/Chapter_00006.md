**Chapter 6: Strike!**  

Wang Chan suddenly snapped back to reality, his skin prickling with goosebumps as he nearly cried out in alarm.  

Especially when he saw Madam Cheng, bathed in the glow of peach blossoms and exuding an eerie allure, pinning the ghostly figure to the ground and grinding it beneath her. The sight shook him to his core.  

Now that he took a closer look, Madam Cheng’s cultivation wasn’t the thirty strands of mana she had displayed the day before—she was actually slightly stronger than the demonic cultivator Li Yuan.  

Instinctively, Wang Chan took a step back.  

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Wang, you’ve arrived just in time!" Madam Cheng lifted her delicate face, casting a glance his way with eyes as soft as silk. "This humble one is barely holding him down and has no strength to spare. Come, lend me a hand—use your needles to pierce his Yin Qiao acupoint!"  

Her voice, sweet as honey, could melt bones, but to Wang Chan, it sounded like the shriek of a vengeful ghost, chilling him to the marrow.  

At the same time, the green-robed man lying on the ground managed to turn his head slightly, his gaze burning into Wang Chan like a ghost’s glare. Though he couldn’t speak, his eyes seemed to issue a silent warning.  

*You two can play your little game. I’m not sticking around.*  

Wang Chan didn’t dare respond. Since he couldn’t slip away unnoticed, his only option was to flee. Seizing the moment while they were occupied, he spun around and bolted, wishing he had four legs to run even faster.  

"This man is the demonic cultivator Li Yuan!" Madam Cheng’s voice pierced his ears like a demonic whisper, sounding as though she were speaking right beside him despite the distance. "If you leave, Fellow Daoist Wang, and I fail to kill him, do you think he’ll spare you once he escapes?"  

Her tone turned icy. "And if you’re running to alert the patrols, I’d rather let my enemy go for now and chase you down first to eliminate any future trouble. You don’t actually think you can outrun me, do you?"  

Wang Chan froze mid-step, then slowly turned back to glare at Madam Cheng, his expression darkening.  

Now that she had pointed it out, he realized he was trapped between a rock and a hard place.  

*If that’s the case…* His eyes flickered with calculation. *Why not take advantage of their stalemate and finish them both off with a needle each?*  

As if reading his mind, Madam Cheng chuckled softly. "If you truly believe your low-grade needles can break our defenses and kill us, Fellow Daoist Wang, feel free to try."  

Her words snapped him back to reality. Upon closer inspection, he noticed intricate mystical patterns swirling within both the peach blossom illusion and the ghostly figure beneath it.  

The former had thirty-two layers.  

The latter, twenty-nine.  

"Divine patterns… a mid-grade divine ability!" Wang Chan’s expression shifted. "These demonic cultivators are truly formidable, each with their own divine abilities!"  

He unclenched his fists, frustration gnawing at him. His *Withering Vitality Needles* stood no chance against a mid-grade divine ability—even if they were fully enchanted.  

Unless his opponents stood still and let him strike repeatedly, he might have a sliver of a chance.  

But he didn’t have nearly enough mana for that.  

"Since he’s currently immobilized by me, Fellow Daoist Wang, you can strike freely," Madam Cheng added. "His Yin Qiao acupoint’s defenses have already been weakened by my divine ability. Once you break through, I can dismantle his technique."  

At her words, Li Yuan’s eyes widened in terror, though he remained unable to speak, his glare intensifying.  

"And what if, after this, Madam Cheng decides to turn on me?" Wang Chan suppressed his unease, his mind racing. "Wouldn’t it be safer to flee now and find the patrols? At least then I’d have a sliver of hope."  

"I can swear a Dao Heart Oath," Madam Cheng replied, her tone now serious and devoid of her earlier coquettishness. "I vow never to harm you afterward, nor will I seek retribution. Naturally, you must swear the same."  

She narrowed her eyes. "If that’s still not enough, then run if you must. But don’t think I won’t chase you down and kill you first. Truth be told, asking for your help is merely to avoid damaging my foundation while eliminating this enemy. Did you really think I *wanted* to swear a Dao Heart Oath?"  

A Dao Heart Oath was no trifling matter. Breaking it would trigger a backlash, crippling one’s cultivation and severing any hope of advancing further. Unlike blood contracts, which could sometimes be circumvented at a cost, a Dao Heart Oath was inescapable—a binding curse on one’s very soul.  

For cultivators, it was the heaviest of constraints.  

Those with true ambition would never swear such an oath lightly.  

And Madam Cheng certainly wouldn’t risk her own future for someone as insignificant as him.  

"Very well," Wang Chan said after a pause. "But I have a few additions to the oath’s terms."  

He laid out his conditions, the most crucial being that if either party acted against the other, the oath would be voided, freeing the other from its constraints.  

With his cultivation panel, Wang Chan knew he would grow stronger given time. By then, Madam Cheng would be nothing to him.  

But what if she abandoned her path of cultivation in the future and came after him? He couldn’t let her kill him just because of an oath.  

A few moments later, Madam Cheng stared at him with an odd expression, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "I never would’ve guessed that the man who groped me two days ago would be so… cautious. Fine, I accept your terms."  

Soon, she recited the oath word for word.  

Wang Chan had no choice but to follow suit. The moment he finished, he felt an inexplicable force wrap around him, sending a shiver down his spine—though he couldn’t pinpoint its source.  

*If oaths in my past life had this kind of power, half the world would’ve been struck by lightning.*  

"Now, Fellow Daoist Wang, hurry with your needles," Madam Cheng purred, her demeanor shifting back to that of a seductress now that the oath was sworn. "I can’t wait any longer."  

Wang Chan was taken aback by her sudden change. The woman’s moods shifted faster than flipping a page, and she did it effortlessly.  

But with her urging him on, he wasted no time. Stepping forward, he focused on finding the right moment to strike.  

This was no time for propriety.  

Noticing his scrutiny, Madam Cheng even helpfully adjusted her posture, giving him a better angle.  

*"Beauty is but skin-deep—just a rotting corpse in the making."*  

Wang Chan steadied his mind, ignoring the distracting curves and focusing solely on the ghostly figure beneath her.  

The energy around Li Yuan’s Yin Qiao acupoint was indeed thinner than elsewhere.  

Yet even so, Wang Chan hesitated.  

Whatever divine ability that ghostly figure embodied, its sinister aura was overwhelming. Despite being several yards away, its chilling presence made his skin crawl.  

"Madam Cheng," he said, summoning a *Withering Vitality Needle* but not yet striking, "my low-grade needles won’t withstand that corrupting energy. Even if they survive, I’ll have to spend considerable effort purifying them afterward."  

"Just do it," Madam Cheng snapped, exasperated. "I’ll compensate you with fifty spirit coins, plus ten more for the purification. Must you haggle over mere coins at a time like this?"  

Though this path was secluded, there was still a chance of passersby. Any delay risked complications.  

"Madam Cheng is most generous." Wang Chan clasped his hands from afar. "But that ghostly figure is a mid-grade divine ability. One needle won’t be enough—I’ll need all three. And all three will be tainted..."  

"*One hundred spirit coins!*" Madam Cheng nearly shouted, her patience fraying. "Now *strike!*"  

"*Strike!*"  

With her promise secured, Wang Chan acted. Channeling three strands of mana into the *Withering Vitality Needle*, he activated its nine enchantments. The needle shot forth like a streak of withered yellow light, aimed straight for Li Yuan’s Yin Qiao acupoint.  

The yellow glow was the result of the *Grave Yin Energy* imbued within the needle—a yin-based force unafraid of corruption. Had he used *Vital Wood Essence* instead, the contamination would’ve cost him far more than twenty spirit coins to fix.  

Besides, if he unleashed all thirteen enchantments along with the *Grave Yin Energy*, one needle would’ve sufficed.  

But she had offered *one hundred spirit coins*.  

He *had* to make it three needles.  

For the money.
