**Chapter 152: An Arrow That Only a Heavenly Venerable Cannot Evade**

"Friend, don't jump to conclusions until the very last moment, didn't you say that yourself?" Zhou Tian motioned for the King of Gods not to rush, but to watch patiently.

The King of Gods' eyes were deep, his gaze shifting, but he said nothing.

Zhou Changsheng's face was pale, not from being startled by the scene before him, but because the small pot in his palm had drawn too much of his energy. As one's cultivation realm grew higher, the disparity became greater, and many supreme treasures possessed unimaginable power, each use requiring massive amounts of energy. At lower realms, one might barely be able to use a weapon of a higher realm, but now, each realm was like an insurmountable chasm. Had this Heavenly Venerable Artifact not been damaged, it would have likely drained Zhou Changsheng dry the moment it was activated. Even so, after using it a few times, he found it somewhat unbearable. He pulled out a few golden, fragrant pills, popped them into his mouth, and found some temporary relief.

"Brother Changsheng, this place is strange. We have very little information about it, so we must be cautious!" Xuan Zhenzi said with a solemn expression. They knew very little about the Hall of Gods, only that such an ancient hall existed, which had vanished after the ancient great war, and many powerful figures had searched for a long time without finding it.

"Mn." Zhou Changsheng nodded, his eyes gleaming brightly. Another pupil even appeared within his pupils, radiating golden divine light. He was using a powerful eye technique to probe these divine spirit phantoms. As his eye technique swept across, his expression grew even more solemn, for he discovered that these phantoms were gradually solidifying. Strange symbols were combining, containing divine light, as if divine spirits were being reborn.

Zhou Changsheng held the small pot in one hand and clenched his other hand into a fist, veins bulging. A dragon shadow coiled around it, its head forming his fist, its eyes fierce, its scales glowing, lifelike. Accompanied by a high-pitched dragon roar, a great dragon burst forth. At first, it was only a few feet long, but in the blink of an eye, it grew to a hundred zhang, brandishing its claws and fangs, heading directly towards the Lord of Sacred Gods.

*Clank-clank*, bronze chains shot out from an unknown part of the great hall, immensely thick, inscribed with profound runes. They directly pierced through the great dragon, shattering it. Zhou Changsheng's long-prepared attack didn't even qualify to be suppressed.

Zhou Changsheng and the others' faces sank. Only now did they discover that this Hall of Gods was also a Heavenly Venerable Artifact. However, due to the shattered Divine Realm, this palace's power was no longer what it once was, barely retaining some power of a Heavenly Venerable Artifact, just about qualifying as a Half-Step Heavenly Venerable Artifact. Because this palace was special and not controlled by a single person, they only now discovered its unusual nature.

At this moment, the Lord of Sacred Gods' chanting had also subsided, seemingly nearing its end. All the phantoms seated on the ancient divine thrones had solidified, their skin becoming as clear as jade, their expressions stern, as if they had been resurrected.

"I never thought we would have another chance to fight."

On the ancient divine throne that had just repelled Zhou Tian, which was also the only ancient throne in the front row with a divine position inheritance, sat a golden divine spirit. He wore golden armor that only covered parts of his body, leaving large areas of skin exposed. He didn't have overly exaggerated muscles, instead appearing somewhat slender. A golden longbow lay on his lap, its falcon-like tail shaped like a flower, inscribed with unique patterns. At this moment, his pupils glowed as he looked towards the Lord of Sacred Gods, his eyes containing a certain emotion, as if he wanted to say something more.

"As expected of the Hunter God, such a strong imprint actually remains within his divine position." The Lord of Sacred Gods and the others also showed surprise, as if they hadn't expected it. However, surveying the entire hall, only this Hunter God possessed sentience. While other divine spirits had powerful auras, their eyes were actually completely hollow.

The Hunter God sighed lightly, saying no more. At this moment, he was merely an imprint remaining on the divine position, not the Hunter God's true body. The Hunter God had long since perished in ancient times.

"Are they the ones?" The Hunter God turned to look at Zhou Changsheng and his group, his tone inscrutable. "A pointless war."

He seemed to have discerned their origins. He gently picked up the golden longbow on his lap, nocked an arrow, and drew the bow. A pale golden arrow condensed on the bowstring. There were no special techniques involved, nor any earth-shattering phenomena. It seemed utterly unremarkable, just like a mortal hunter hunting a wild beast in the mountains.

*Whizz!*

The bowstring hummed, sending out ripples. The pale golden arrow shot forth, neither fast nor slow. However, Zhou Changsheng and the others' expressions changed drastically, their hearts warning them madly. They felt as if they were being targeted by an ancient ferocious beast, killing intent coming from all directions, yet paradoxically, the arrow itself held no killing intent.

"Tower, arise!" Xuan Zhenzi, beside Zhou Changsheng, stepped forward. A purple auspicious cloud emerged above his head, and a dark golden, exquisite small tower appeared. The six-sided tower was worn and mottled, with only three layers remaining along with its base. A faint glazed golden light enveloped Zhou Changsheng and the others.

The pale golden arrow flew slowly, firmly locking onto Zhou Changsheng and his companions. The arrow touched the glazed golden light emanating from the small tower. There was no energy burst; it remained calm, but the arrow, though slow, drilled forward with unwavering speed.

After firing this arrow, the Hunter God's originally substantial body began to dissipate. He turned to the Lord of Sacred Gods and said, "I hope you find a suitable successor for my divine position." After saying this, his body dissipated, condensing into a shimmering golden longbow rune, which fell into the Lord of Sacred Gods' hand.

"He was unwilling to fight any longer. He condensed all his power, including his own imprint, barely achieving a strike equivalent to his full might." The God of Death spoke.

The three divine spirits fell silent for a moment, as if recalling something.

On this side, Zhou Changsheng and the others' faces turned extremely grim. Blood even spilled from Xuan Zhenzi's lips as he held the small tower. Upon closer inspection, a needle-like hole had appeared on the tower. That arrow had actually left a wound on this Heavenly Venerable Artifact. However, seeing the dissipating Hunter God, they finally breathed a sigh of relief. If another arrow had come, they truly wouldn't have been able to withstand it.

"Gosh, this guy is quite powerful." Zhou Tian stood beside the King of Gods, exclaiming in admiration.

"Indeed, the Hunter God was incredibly powerful in ancient times. That arrow of his, only a Heavenly Venerable could possibly evade it." The King of Gods also sighed slightly, a hint of nostalgia in his expression.

"Only a Heavenly Venerable could evade it? Tsk tsk, how did such a powerful figure die? I've seen many who were ranked lower than him escape." Zhou Tian clicked his tongue in wonder. How could such an impressive figure not have escaped?

"Such is the impermanence of the world..." The King of Gods remained silent for a long time before sighing, not saying anything more.

Zhou Tian just mentioned it casually. He wasn't that curious about the story of a divine spirit who had died countless years ago.
