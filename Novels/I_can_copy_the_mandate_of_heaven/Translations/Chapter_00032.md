# 32, Thick and Thin

"Get up!" Li Zhiming yanked Han Li, who was lying on the bed like a corpse. "Take a look at this."

"What is it?" Han Li rubbed his eyes, forced awake. He reluctantly examined the 'Seven Armored Elephant Technique' Li Zhiming offered. He carefully read the preface and the following pages, where the creator discussed the technique's difficulties.

Then, he skimmed the general method of cultivation.

After a while, under Li Zhiming's expectant gaze, Han Li rubbed his eyes, confused. "Did Master give this to you to practice?"

"Yeah."

"Then you practice it."

"No, I want you to practice it first."

"Me? I can't practice it."

"Why can't you?"

"Why *could* I?" Han Li retorted helplessly. "Didn't you read what the creator wrote? He developed this technique because he was born without the ability to feel pain. That's the only way it could be accomplished. That's why so few people have even managed to begin it."

"If this technique was really as powerful as it claims, invincible under heaven, why would it be gathering dust in the Seven Mysteries Sect?"

"Obviously, normal people can't practice it," Han Li said, flipping through the pages again. "But it does seem pretty powerful."

With that, he lay back down, tossing the manual back to Li Zhiming. His mind was focused on the Looping Steps and Blinking Sword Technique. He had no interest in anything else. Besides, even if he did manage to practice the Seven Armored Elephant Technique, he wouldn't be able to withstand Doctor Mo's palm strike.

That was the real reason for his lack of interest.

"Hey, now hold on," Li Zhiming blurted out, bewildered by Han Li's reaction. "Others can't practice it, but you can! Just try it, okay?"

Han Li was also puzzled by Li Zhiming's insistence. "Why would I be able to practice it? Am I not a normal person? I'm afraid of pain too!"

"Huh? You…"

Wait a minute!

Li Zhiming finally understood. In a flash of inspiration, he realized a very basic logical error he had been making since he was young.

Han Li couldn't *see* his Destiny!

Li Zhiming was shocked and couldn't help but stare at Han Li.

That's right, only *he* could see Destiny. Which meant that even if Han Li possessed a Destiny like 'Late Bloomer,' he himself wouldn't know it!

He was only passively utilizing the 'Late Bloomer' Destiny while practicing cultivation techniques, eventually becoming a 'Late Bloomer'!

Rising step by step from an ordinary village boy to the path of immortality...

But in reality, he didn't know about it himself!

In that instant, Li Zhiming stood frozen in place, as if struck by lightning, a tingling sensation turning into a feeling of clarity. All this time, Li Zhiming had been complaining and blaming fate, feeling that the heavens had treated him unfairly.

Seeing the ordinariness of the masses and the heaven-defying Destinies of some protagonist figures had created a strong sense of unwillingness and resentment.

But now, looking back, how unkind had fate really been to him?

Han Li couldn't see 'Late Bloomer,' but *he* could!

Han Li didn't know how to utilize 'Late Bloomer,' but *he* did!

"What's wrong, Fourth?" Seeing Li Zhiming acting strangely, now standing there in a daze, lost in thought, Han Li couldn't help but ask from his bed.

"Nothing," Li Zhiming replied, snapping out of his thoughts and looking at Han Li. "Maybe you should really give it a try when you have time. What if there's a 'miracle'?"

Han Li shook his head, thinking his companion was being a nuisance, and lazily dismissed the idea. This was similar to how he refused to reveal what he saw in Master's cave a year and a half ago.

Li Zhiming could only remain silent. There were things he couldn't say.

Like what? 'I can see your Destiny, I can see everyone's Destiny, I used to have eye problems?'

Doctor Mo can't cure brain problems, thank you very much.

Li Zhiming sat back by the window, reading the Seven Armored Elephant Technique himself. At that moment, a strong surge of Qi and blood seemed to be stirring in his heart, urging him to study the manual. Perhaps one day, this technique could unleash extraordinary power in his hands.

The cultivation process of the Seven Armored Elephant Technique was indeed painful and morbid. As Li Zhiming turned the pages, he felt a shiver run down his spine.

No wonder only the creator, who couldn't feel pain, could cultivate it. Such a domineering martial art, placed in the Seven Mysteries Sect's scripture pavilion, was gathering dust for a reason.

The creator claimed that the essence of the technique was to mimic the physical qualities of a Dragon Elephant, allowing one to possess the abilities of an ancient, wild beast, unstoppable and invincible. This required remodeling one's bones and flesh, ultimately achieving blood Qi like armor, blood flow like mercury, thick tendons like elephant hide, bones stronger than oxen and elephants, and breath stronger than tigers and leopards. At night, one's Qi and blood would be as noticeable as daylight.

Tigers and leopards would flee at the mere scent of it. One would be impervious to swords and spears, possess god-like strength, be able to leap high and deep, and lift stones weighing ten thousand catties.

Even at the initial stages, one punch could kill anything.

As for mastery... the creator himself had never seen it. He had only reached the initial stages. On the path to mastery, he discovered that the human body ultimately had its limits, an insurmountable bottleneck.

According to his theory, if a person could truly achieve mastery, they would possess the strength of a Dragon Elephant.

In the end, the creator sighed and said that human flesh was weak, and that reaching his level was already the limit.

"However, even the beginning stages of the Seven Armored Elephant Technique are remarkable!" Even just starting it would grant one the strength of a thousand catties, and Qi and blood like a flood. One could fight ten people simultaneously with ease.

One could fight tirelessly for ten days and nights, with inexhaustible strength.

One would be nearly impervious to weapons, and near impossible to die from injury!

Extremely perverse!

"No wonder the Seven Mysteries Sect valued this technique, yet kept it hidden." Just mastering this technique would make one unrivaled among martial artists! It was said that when the creator of the Seven Armored Elephant Technique was still alive in the Seven Mysteries Sect, it was the most prosperous time in the sect's history for centuries.

His status was comparable to the Sect Leader, and he held a very special position. With him around, the sect was invincible.

Once, the Seven Mysteries Sect was besieged by the Ten Great Sects, and the mountain gate was on the verge of collapse, with eight of the nine mountain peaks breached. It was this master, who had achieved the initial stages of the Elephant Technique, who descended the mountain, killing a peak martial artist with one punch, like a tiger descending the mountain to kill.

In the end, with his own strength, he unscathed, killed thirty-nine famous martial artists and seven Sect Leader-level figures, causing shock throughout the land.

From that battle onward, the Seven Mysteries Sect gained a resounding reputation, and seven of the original Ten Great Sects quickly declined and disappeared.

The creator of the Elephant Technique was powerful beyond imagination!

But unfortunately, his lineage ended with his death. Not only was there no one to inherit it, but the creator did not even have a single personal disciple!

It wasn't that he didn't look for disciples, but he had. He had accepted over three hundred and forty disciples in his life, fifty-nine of whom died prematurely, and the rest of whom all left the sect. Twenty years before his death, he was disheartened and stopped accepting disciples, and began looking for people who were naturally unafraid of pain.

However, he didn't find one before he died.

After his death, the Seven Mysteries Sect continued to vigorously promote the Seven Armored Elephant Technique, but after seventy years, no one had even entered the first stage. In the end, the Seven Mysteries Sect had no choice but to shelve the technique, where it gathered dust until it was stolen by Doctor Mo.

So the question was, Li Zhiming didn't think he could practice it either. If he had a 'Late Bloomer' Destiny, he might try.

But he didn't.

Superficially, it seemed that someone as strong as Da Niu would be suitable for practicing this, but alas, Da Niu was even more afraid of pain than he was.

He wondered what Master's intention was in giving him this technique.
