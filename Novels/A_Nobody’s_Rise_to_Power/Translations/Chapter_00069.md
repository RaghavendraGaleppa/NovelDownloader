# Chapter 69: A Fight to the Death

A light rain fell, and the sky was dim.

A villager wearing a raincoat trudged through the mud, his steps heavy and uncertain.

He was hurrying back to the village when his gaze was suddenly caught by a figure lying collapsed at the entrance.

"Who's there?"

He muttered, moving closer as he carefully turned the person, who was face down, over.

A face, pale as paper from excessive blood loss, made him gasp in shock. "Licheng?!"

This was none other than the nephew of Company Commander Kang Zhengyang!

The villager’s hair stood on end. He immediately shouted at the top of his lungs, "Help! Something's happened! Licheng is dying!"

Soon, villagers from nearby houses rushed over through the rain.

They lifted the unconscious Kang Licheng with a flurry of hands, not caring about the mud splashing their bodies, and jogged toward the Kang family's courtyard.

The news spread like a wildfire through the village.

The Kangs' small courtyard was quickly filled with relatives and friendly company soldiers who had heard the news. Everyone's face was a mask of shock and concern.

The village had a strong martial culture, and the villagers possessed some basic medical knowledge.

Kang Licheng's main injury was a deep cut from a blade, which had caused significant blood loss. Someone quickly crushed some hemostatic herbs and applied them to the wound, binding it tightly with clean cloth strips. Then, they pried open his jaw and poured a bowl of hot ginger soup down his throat.

After a flurry of activity, a faint groan escaped Kang Licheng's throat. His eyelids fluttered, and he finally regained consciousness.

Before his vision had even cleared, he saw two extremely anxious faces by his bedside: his father, Kang Zhengyi, and his uncle, Kang Zhengyang.

"Dad! Uncle!"

Kang Licheng struggled to sit up, his voice urgent. "Hurry! Go to Iron Forest Beam to save Third Uncle! They... they've been surrounded!"

Although Kang Zhengyang was frantic inside, he had more experience and immediately held his nephew down, his voice steady and reassuring. "Don't be in a rush. Take your time. Tell us clearly, what exactly happened?"

Kang Licheng忍着剧痛 (endured the intense pain), and haltingly recounted the events of the ambush at Iron Forest Beam the previous night.

Before he had even finished, the room erupted like a boiling pot.

The two teenage sons of the third brother, Kang Zhengyan, instantly had red eyes.

They clenched their fists and roared, "Uncle, we have to go now!"

"Second Uncle, grab your weapons! We'll fight these sons of bitches!"

Kang Zhengyi was a man of few words, usually so quiet you couldn't get a word out of him, but at this moment, he was like an enraged black bear. His own son had been hacked to the brink of death, and his own brother was trapped in a desperate situation. His eyes were wide with fury as he spat out a single word from his throat: "Go!"

The word had barely left his lips when he spun around like a whirlwind, grabbed a gleaming three-pronged steel fork leaning against the wall, and strode out with murderous intent.

"Old Second, take everyone inside and outside the courtyard and go ahead first!"

Kang Zhengyang immediately made his decision. He sent his second brother, Kang Zhengyi, with the dozens of strong men in the courtyard to provide support first, while he would go and gather more company soldiers.

From his nephew's description, the enemy was no ordinary band of thieves; each one was highly skilled.

To dare travel a long distance with a convoy of four large carts with only twenty-some men, if they weren't a dragon crossing the river, they wouldn't have such nerve.

But even if they were a dragon crossing the river, the local dragon—the head of the Kang family—was not the least bit afraid.

If his third brother and the fellow villagers doing business with him were to meet a tragic end, how could he face their families?

Guilt and anxiety were gnawing at his heart like venomous snakes; he had to do something.

Less than half an hour after Kang Zhengyi led his men away, Kang Zhengyang had gathered another seventy or eighty strong company soldiers.

The roads were muddy after the rain, and riding a horse was more of a hindrance than a help. Besides, there weren't many horses in Feng'an Village.

Everyone proceeded on foot, led by Kang Zhengyang, along the slippery road straight toward Iron Forest Beam.

This was a private matter for the Kang family, and the company soldiers were not, on the surface, under the village head's command. However, since these company soldiers were also villagers, he still sent his wife to report the matter to Feng'an Fortress.

Upon hearing the news, Yang Can leaped up from his reclining chair.

When he had traveled from Jincheng back to Tianshui with Yu Chengye to fetch the bride, he had personally experienced the ferocity of the bandits and thieves on the Longshang plains.

The people of Longshang had fierce customs and a strong martial tradition, but whether the company soldiers in the village were a match for those desperate men who lived on the edge of a blade, he couldn't be sure.

"Sound the bell! Gather all the able-bodied men!" Yang Can ordered without hesitation.

Soon, the urgent tolling of the bell echoed from Feng'an Fortress.

Yang Can, leading the guard martial artists like Leopard Head, and gathering over two hundred strong young men from the village, hurried toward Iron Forest Beam through the gradually easing drizzle.

Yang Can, Leopard Head, and the others rode horses, but the muddy roads made it impossible to ride fast, so they eventually dismounted and proceeded on foot.

By the time Kang Zhengyang led his men to Iron Forest Beam, the light rain had almost stopped, leaving only a faint, lingering drizzle.

The scene before them was enough to shatter one's courage. The ground had been washed by the rain into a strange, pale red.

Pale, stiff corpses lay scattered on the ground, like abandoned, tattered dolls.

"Old Third!"

Kang Zhengyang threw himself beside a familiar corpse—it was his third brother, Kang Zhengyan.

He held his brother's cold body, tears in his eyes, his body trembling slightly from immense grief.

Kang Zhengyi clenched his fists, which were as big as bowls, his teeth gritted, and two ridges of muscle bulged on his face.

In the rain, a low wailing could be heard.

It was the sound of company soldiers who had found their relatives' bodies and could not control their sobs.

"Company Commander, I found fresh cart tracks two li away! It must be them; they went west!"

Li Quanxin, a hunter skilled at tracking who had been carefully searching for traces in the mud, ran over urgently, holding a hunting knife.

Most of the mountain paths were rocky, and the shallow tracks left by carts and horses were washed away by the rain and became invisible.

Li Quanxin had run several miles along the mountain path and found traces at the mountain pass that had not yet been destroyed by the rain.

Kang Zhengyang gently laid down his brother's body and slowly stood up. The sorrow on his face had been replaced by a cold killing intent.

With a *shing* sound, he drew his waist sword, his voice hoarse but resounding with conviction.

"Dayou, take a few men and... send them back."

"Everyone else!"

His gaze swept coldly over the faces filled with grief and indignation. "Follow me!"

When Yang Can led the two hundred or so strong men to the scene, they met the company soldiers escorting the bodies back to the village halfway.

They had used materials at hand—tree trunks of appropriate thickness, vines, and branches—to make makeshift stretchers and were trudging through the night.

Seeing the long line of torches ahead, they knew people from the village had arrived, and they stopped.

"Dayou, you mean Company Commander Kang led the others in pursuit? Which way did they go?"

The company soldier explained Kang Zhengyang's direction to Leopard Head.

Leopard Head, who was familiar with the terrain, immediately said to Yang Can, "Village Head, if they went west from Iron Forest Beam, they can only be heading for Grey Wolf Gorge."

Yang Can asked, "What kind of place is Grey Wolf Gorge?"

Leopard Head replied, "Once you pass Grey Wolf Gorge, you'll be in the pasture of a Xianbei tribe. Actually, if you're going to Grey Wolf Gorge, it's closer and the road is better if you go through our village."

Yang Can's eyes lit up. "Does that mean we can still catch up if we go now?"

If they were to go from Feng'an Village to Grey Wolf Gorge, it would be a shorter route than cutting through Iron Forest Beam. Of course, for those of them who hadn't yet reached Iron Forest Beam, they wouldn't have to take such a long detour.

Leopard Head said, "That's right. If we go from the village, it's closer. But if we turn there directly now, we'll have to cross a mountain up ahead."

Crossing a mountain at night is no easy task. In this era, many desolate mountains had almost no signs of human activity. Therefore, pitfalls, cliffs... all sorts of dangers were hidden under the undisturbed bushes and vines. Even climbing the mountain in broad daylight, a moment of carelessness could get you killed, let alone at night.

So Yang Can asked cautiously.

Leopard Head said, "It's fine. It's a barren mountain, with not a blade of grass on it."

"Then let's go, we'll pursue them!" Yang Can made a decisive choice.

The dragon of fire immediately changed direction and hurried toward the silhouette of the barren mountain, which looked like the spine of a giant beast, in the distant night.

The next morning, after the rain, the sun was out for the first time. The sunlight was scorching and quickly dried the muddy roads until they were hard.

It wasn't just the sun; the wind here was also dry.

The carts and horses, which had been difficult to move, suddenly became much lighter and faster.

The leader of the caravan carrying mountain goods felt a great weight lift from his heart.

Just one heavy rain, and all traces would be washed away.

Once they passed the Grey Wolf Gorge ahead, they would be in Xianbei territory, and this deadly business would be completed.

They had already received news that the current village head of Feng'an was someone else.

That was precisely why they hadn't gone to Feng'an Village as they usually did.

Now that they had killed people near Feng'an Village, they needed to deliver the goods as soon as possible to feel at ease.

However, they never imagined that Kang Zhengyang and his men, led by the hunter Li Quanxin, had already taken a shortcut and were timely catching up.

On the grassy slope, Kang Zhengyang, who hadn't slept all night, had eyes full of bloodshot veins.

But he was like the most patient leopard, staring intently at the slope below.

His fingers slowly and powerfully stropped the cold sword hilt.

There was no need for further confirmation. That convoy had four large carts, and he recognized them.

Because the cargo on those carts was precisely the goods he had purchased.

Beside him, Kang Zhengyi was breathing heavily, the three-pronged steel fork in his grasp now warm from his body heat.

His entire body's muscles were taut as he said with a trembling voice, "Big Brother!"

He had only called out "Big Brother," but the flesh on his cheeks was already twitching. This honest man looked exceptionally ferocious at this moment.

"No, we can't ambush them here!"

Kang Zhengyang stared intently at the carts and horses on the slope below and slowly shook his head.

Even without Kang Zhengyi saying more, he had to kill these people.

Otherwise, he would have no way to face his own family, his friends, and his company soldiers.

But his nephew Licheng had said the enemy's numbers were similar to their own caravan's.

However, now only Kang Licheng from their caravan was alive, while the bandits had hardly diminished in number.

This meant their martial prowess was far superior to that of the village's company soldiers.

Kang Zhengyang now had over a hundred men, a number that was enough to completely overwhelm the enemy.

But this slope was too gentle. If they charged down from here, the enemy would be alerted before they could even engage in close combat.

In that case, wouldn't more of their own people have to die?

"Old Second, since they took this path, they can only be heading for Grey Wolf Gorge," Kang Zhengyang said in a low voice. "We'll take the mountain path, use a shortcut, and wait for them at Grey Wolf Gorge!"

Kang Zhengyang was a company commander and possessed basic military acumen.

After just a moment of thought, he knew how to act to their greatest advantage.

An ambush would obviously result in fewer casualties, and... it would be easier to annihilate them completely!
