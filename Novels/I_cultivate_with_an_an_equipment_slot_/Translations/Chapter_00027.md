# Chapter 27: Reconstructing the Herb Garden  

"I am Liu Changfeng, greeting the esteemed master of Qingheng Sect."  

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Liu Changfeng held considerable prestige in this region. Yet, when facing disciples of the Qingheng Sect, he could only bow his head humbly, not daring to show the slightest disrespect.  

The reason was simple—the Qingheng Sect was the absolute overlord of the Tianmu Mountain Range. Without exaggeration, without the Qingheng Sect, this fertile land suitable for human habitation would not exist.  

"This junior brother is the herbalist responsible for your Liu family," the two Foundation Establishment disciples said, paying little attention to Liu Changfeng's deference and instead introducing Zhang Yan.  

"I am Zhang Yan, greetings to Family Head Liu."  

Zhang Yan quickly stepped forward and bowed.  

Though Liu Changfeng's attitude was respectful, he was still a Foundation Establishment cultivator, while Zhang Yan was only at the early Qi Refining stage. Even as a Qingheng Sect disciple, Zhang Yan had to show him due respect given the gap in their cultivation levels.  

"Young friend Zhang... truly has extraordinary talent!"  

Liu Changfeng was momentarily stunned upon seeing Zhang Yan's age but immediately offered praise. He had met herbalists before, but one this young was a first.  

Moreover, sensing Zhang Yan's cultivation at the second level of Qi Refinement indicated decent aptitude. These two factors combined made Liu Changfeng dismiss any underestimation.  

He couldn't help but sigh inwardly—the Qingheng Sect truly lived up to its reputation as the hegemon of the Tianmu Mountain Range. Even an ordinary disciple possessed such remarkable talent.  

"Very well. Junior Brother Zhang will be entrusted to you. We will return to fetch him in six months."  

After completing the formalities with Liu Changfeng, the two Foundation Establishment disciples wasted no time and returned to their flying vessel.  

"Young friend Zhang, come with me. You'll be staying with our Liu family for the next while."  

Liu Changfeng smiled and led the way, immediately arranging accommodations for Zhang Yan. That evening, he even hosted a banquet in Zhang Yan's honor.  

While Zhang Yan wasn't particularly interested in the banquet itself, he was quite taken with the spirit fruits and wines served. Not only were they delicious, but they also slightly boosted his cultivation—though the effect was minimal, it was better than nothing.  

After the banquet, Zhang Yan learned the details of his task.  

The Liu family had several spirit herbs, but some had developed issues, prompting them to seek help from the Qingheng Sect—hence this sect mission.  

Beyond that, after the banquet, Liu Changfeng took Zhang Yan aside for a private conversation.  

He hoped that during these six months, Zhang Yan could mentor some of the Liu family's younger members.  

Of course, he didn’t expect Zhang Yan to provide formal instruction—just some guidance.  

In return, Liu Changfeng presented Zhang Yan with additional gifts.  

Zhang Yan naturally had no objections.  

Not having to teach formally while gaining an extra helper for menial tasks was more than acceptable.  

Thus, the next morning, when Zhang Yan emerged from meditation, he found two Liu family disciples—one male, one female—already waiting in the courtyard.  

"Greetings, Master."  

The two disciples bowed. The male was slightly older, while the female appeared around Zhang Yan's age. Her delicate face bore a trace of nervousness, and her bright eyes darted anxiously toward him.  

"Follow me. First, take me to your herb garden."  

Zhang Yan gave them a brief glance before nodding.  

"Yes, Master!" Seeing that Zhang Yan seemed approachable, the two quickly led the way.  

The Liu family's herb garden was located at the heart of their estate—both for security and because the spiritual energy there was relatively abundant.  

Unlike the Qingheng Sect, which possessed a third-grade spiritual vein, several second-grade veins, and over a dozen first-grade veins, the Liu family only had a single first-grade vein.  

As a result, spiritual energy was scarce within the Liu family. To cultivate effectively, they had to concentrate the limited spiritual energy in specific areas, such as the herb garden.  

"The spiritual energy here is so thin. How do you usually cultivate?" Zhang Yan asked, puzzled.  

"By using cultivation chambers or meditating normally," the Liu siblings replied, slightly confused by the question.  

"I see."  

After their explanation, Zhang Yan finally understood.  

Cultivators needed spiritual energy to progress, but the Liu family's spiritual vein was too meager. Thus, they had to gather what little energy they had into designated cultivation chambers.  

"The path of cultivation is truly difficult!"  

At that moment, Zhang Yan felt immensely grateful for having joined the Qingheng Sect.  

With his low-grade spiritual roots, cultivation would have been a far greater struggle otherwise.  

Upon arriving at the Liu family's herb garden, Zhang Yan's eyes lit up.  

To his surprise, the garden contained quite a few spirit herbs—some even of first-grade upper-tier and second-grade quality.  

But upon reflection, it made sense.  

This was the Liu family's only herb garden, so all their spirit herbs were concentrated here.  

"Something’s wrong here."  

Yet the moment Zhang Yan stepped inside, his brows furrowed.  

"Firebloom and Frostgrass have conflicting elemental properties. How could you plant them so close together?" He pointed at two herbs, visibly shocked.  

"And this Earthvine—it thrives in dark, damp environments. Yet you’ve placed it right under direct sunlight? Are you cultivating herbs or ruining them?"  

"W-we didn’t know..."  

The Liu siblings shook their heads blankly. Though they had been assigned to learn from Zhang Yan, their knowledge of herb cultivation was rudimentary at best—sufficient for tending spirit rice but far from expert.  

They could only nod along half-understandingly to Zhang Yan's critique.  

"This herb garden needs a complete redesign."  

After a brief inspection, Zhang Yan concluded.  

Since the Liu siblings couldn’t make such a decision, they reported it to Liu Changfeng.  

"Is a full reconstruction absolutely necessary?"  

"Not strictly, but patching it up will only be a temporary fix. To resolve the underlying issues, we need to rebuild and reorganize the planting zones."  

Zhang Yan answered honestly, leaving the final choice to the Liu family.  

In the end, Liu Changfeng opted for a full reconstruction.  

He even promised Zhang Yan access to the family’s treasure vault upon completion, allowing him to select one item—be it a magical artifact, spirit herb, or talisman.  

Zhang Yan happily agreed.  

Though small families like the Lius rarely possessed extraordinary treasures, they often specialized in unique crafts to survive in the cultivation world.  

If he remembered correctly, the Liu family excelled in alchemy.
