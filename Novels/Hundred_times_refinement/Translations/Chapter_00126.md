# Chapter 76: The New Beast Talisman  

"This is quite interesting. Although it doesn't have much power, it's still good for scaring people. How much does it cost?"  

"One spirit stone per talisman."  

"What? One spirit stone?" The cultivator was shocked. "That's so expensive! You might as well rob me!"  

"Exactly! Selling a low-grade talisman at such a high price—you must be desperate for spirit stones."  

...  

Faced with the crowd's criticism, Liu Jing looked aggrieved. "But this isn't an ordinary low-grade talisman."  

"So what? Its power is still the same as a low-grade one."  

No wonder they complained. Ordinary low-grade talismans were worth less than one spirit stone for ten sheets. This price was indeed outrageous. As Qi Refining cultivators, most were quite poor and couldn't afford such extravagance.  

As the crowd dispersed, Liu Jing sighed. In the Talisman Mountain Sect, his aptitude was average, but his mind was sharp, often brimming with unconventional ideas that he put into practice. This low-grade talisman that resembled a high-grade one was his proud creation. However, the sect elders didn't appreciate it, instead scolding him for neglecting proper cultivation and wasting time on frivolous pursuits.  

Though Liu Jing dared not argue, he remained unconvinced. Hoping to prove himself, he brought his work to the Talisman Convention, expecting to fetch a good price. Instead, not only did he fail to sell any, but he was also mocked and criticized, leaving him utterly dejected.  

"How many of these talismans do you have?"  

A kind voice reached his ears. Liu Jing looked up to see a young man dressed in the robes of the Drifting Cloud Valley smiling at him.  

Unlike the others, Lin Xuan didn't believe these special low-grade talismans were only good for scaring people. If used cleverly, they could be life-saving treasures.  

After considering how he could make the most of these talismans, Lin Xuan decided to buy them all.  

"I have nine left. Do you want them, Senior Brother?" Liu Jing asked, surprised and hopeful.  

"Only nine?" Lin Xuan hesitated briefly before taking out the spirit stones and completing the transaction.  

In warfare, deception was key—making the false appear real and the real appear false. With these talismans that could mislead the senses, even if Lin Xuan encountered a Foundation Establishment expert, his chances of escaping unscathed would greatly increase.  

Still carrying plenty of spirit stones, Lin Xuan wasn't ready to leave yet. Given the dangers ahead, he wanted to stock up on everything he needed.  

Though he had made some good purchases, the high-grade talismans he truly desired remained elusive.  

Lin Xuan continued walking, no longer paying much attention to the simple stalls. Along the street, besides the temporary setups, there were also beautifully constructed huts. Wang Xin's information hadn't been entirely accurate—as the Talisman Convention's trade volume grew day by day, not only Elder Tianyuan but other Foundation Establishment cultivators from the sect had succumbed to the lure of spirit stones and set up their own stalls.  

Of course, they valued their status too much to mingle with Qi Refining disciples. The Talisman Mountain Sect had specially built these huts to rent out to Foundation Establishment cultivators for selling their talismans.  

This discovery delighted Lin Xuan. Perhaps others were secretly selling high-grade talismans as well. However, after visiting five or six huts, he still found nothing.  

Just as Lin Xuan was about to leave in disappointment, his gaze suddenly locked onto a talisman at a stall at the end of the street. The stall owner was an elderly man with white hair, likely over seventy years old. Though Lin Xuan didn't use his spiritual eye technique, the aura emanating from the man made it clear he was a Foundation Establishment expert.  

A Foundation Establishment cultivator who hadn't rented a hut—could this be Elder Tianyuan, as Wang Xin had mentioned? The thought made Lin Xuan's heart race. Whether his guess was correct or not, the talisman on the stall had already captured his attention.  

It was a blue talisman, slightly larger than usual, with the lifelike image of a sharp-beaked, clawed bird painted on its surface.  

Though it seemed unremarkable at first glance, Lin Xuan was no amateur. A term flashed through his mind—Beast Talisman.  

The only question was what grade of demon beast's soul was sealed inside.  

"Elder, how much for this talisman?" Lin Xuan bowed respectfully.  

The old man glanced up. "Two hundred spirit stones."  

"Two hundred?"  

Lin Xuan was stunned. Though Beast Talismans were special, they weren't usually this expensive. But the old man didn't seem like the type to extort exorbitant prices. Could it be...?  

A possibility occurred to Lin Xuan, though he wasn't sure. Cautiously, he asked, "Elder, isn't two hundred spirit stones a bit too high?"  

"Too high?" The old man sneered, eyeing Lin Xuan sideways. "Boy, do you even know what kind of talisman this is?"  

"A Beast Soul Talisman."  

"Oh?" The old man looked surprised, his sneer fading. "You actually recognize it. Then do you know what kind of demon beast's soul is sealed inside?"  

"This junior doesn't know. I was hoping for your guidance, Elder."  

"It contains the soul of a Sky Soaring Bird that failed to advance."  

The Sky Soaring Bird was a top-tier water-attribute, first-grade demon beast, comparable in strength to the Ironclad Blazing Tiger—both roughly equivalent to a Qi Refining cultivator at the Great Perfection stage.  

But what did "failed to advance" mean?  

Both demon beasts and cultivators could absorb and harness the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. Cultivators could continuously improve their strength through cultivation, advancing from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment, then to Core Formation, and so on.  

The same applied to demon beasts. A first-grade demon beast absorbing spiritual energy and strengthening itself could grow in power, advancing from first-grade to second-grade, then to third-grade...  

On the surface, it seemed similar, but there was a key difference. For cultivators, breaking through bottlenecks allowed multiple attempts. For example, a Qi Refining Great Perfection cultivator attempting to reach Foundation Establishment could try again if they failed the first time, and again if they failed the second, as long as they didn't give up.  

But demon beasts had only one chance to advance. If they failed, they could never try again.  

In this regard, demon beasts were at a disadvantage compared to cultivators. However, they had their own advantages. Take this Sky Soaring Bird, for instance—a top-tier first-grade demon beast. When it attempted to advance to second-grade and failed, unlike a cultivator whose strength would stagnate, the demon beast's power would still increase significantly despite the failure.  

Thus, this failed Sky Soaring Bird's strength was close to that of a newly advanced Foundation Establishment cultivator—not quite equal, but not far off.
