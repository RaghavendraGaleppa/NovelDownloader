# Chapter 84: Hundred-Day Bath, A Fortune in the Black Market

The eastern entrance of Blackwater Port was a chaotic mix of people from all walks of life.

This was the Black Market.

"All things under heaven have their masters. By that logic, my hunt is 'black goods,' not something I can sell openly. I have no choice but to come to the Black Market!"

In a corner of the Black Market.

An unremarkable stall was set up. Li Xian sat on the ground, using a cloth bag as a mat. Before him were neatly arranged animal products: tiger skin, tiger teeth, tiger bones, deer antlers...

The Black Market had no rules and no supervision. Exorbitant prices and swindling money from customers were common occurrences.

However, the authenticity of Li Xian's tiger skin and bones was immediately obvious. There was no way to fake them; they were genuine high-quality goods.

It wasn't long before a buyer came to inquire about the price.

"Little brother, this tiger skin of yours looks quite genuine."

The buyer was a servant from a wealthy family. He touched the tiger skin, felt the fur, and revealed a look of delight. His master would surely love it choice, a a a, a, tiger a a,, choice. a a, a a a, a,, a,,,,, a a The.,,, a The The,,,,,, We,,, The,,,,,,,,,,,,,, eine,, eine,, eine,,,,,,,,,, a,,,,,, a,,, a a a,,,,, covering,, eine a, a,,,, a,,, covering covering covering,, a " " covering,, Li Xian was not intimidated. calmly said, "Eight hundred and fifty wen."

"Alright."

After this negotiation.

The first sum of money came in. Li Xian weighed the the copper coins and felt a sense of joy.

 "Adding this eight hundred and fifty wen, I now have two taels of silver."

Li Xian sat calmly, waiting for more customers.

Animal hides were the most popular. Several people came to inquire about the price. During this time, several people, seeing that Li Xian was very young, tried to intimidate him, intending to force him to sell cheaply.

Li Xian remained unmoved. After several rounds of haggling...

The tiger skin, leopard skin, and deer skin were all sold, earning him a total of two taels of silver.

In addition, animal bones and claws were also very popular.

An hour later, the stall was cleared of all goods. The money on him was now a full five taels.

His pockets were full, and his mood was excellent.

"Money can make the devil push the millstone."

"Money is extremely important!"

Although Li Xian had left the manor few times, he could see the bigger picture from the smallest details. He knew deeply that without money, everything is difficult; with money, everything is smooth. Every time he earned money, he felt an indescribable joy.

Seeing that it was still early, he strolled around the Black Market,顺便 looking to see if there was anything he needed.

The Black Market was full of miscellaneous items.

There were those selling animal products, those selling weapons, and those selling martial arts manuals. However, these items had exorbitant prices that made people too scared to approach.

It was also very easy to get scammed.

It was better to look at smaller items, such as jade, emeralds, porcelain... and so on. Although they were also mixed with fakes and of varying quality, there was a real possibility of finding some good items.

"Hm?"

Li Xian suddenly stopped, his eyes fixed on a black clay figure.

The clay figure was charmingly naive and had a unique shape, but what truly caught Li Xian's attention was its material and color.

It was eighty percent similar to the black lions in front of the Blackwater Gang's main hall.

"How much is this thing?" Li Xian asked.

"Two taels each."

The stall owner was a thin man with a large black mole by his mouth and wide hands and feet. He was likely a fisherman from the Blackwater River area, with excellent swimming skills, who had fished it up from the water.

"Mad for money. For such a small clay figure, even a hundred wen is too much!" Li Xian cursed, turning to leave.

The fisherman's eyes lit up. "Young master, young master, please wait."

"I feel a connection with you, how about one hundred wen? I'll sell it to you for one hundred wen?"

Li Xian sneered: "It seems it's not even worth a hundred wen. Twenty wen, will you sell it or not?"

"Sell, sell!" The fisherman beamed with a smile. "I'll sell it even for twenty wen."

He was originally a fisherman on the river, catching fish along the river. He had fished this item up a few days ago. Seeing its strange craftsmanship, he wanted to try his luck at the Black Market.

He never expected that he would actually be able to sell it.

Li Xian didn't know its use either; he just bought it as a novelty.

After that, Li Xian continued to stroll but didn't make any purchases easily.

By the afternoon, just as he was about to head home, Li Xian's attention was caught by another item.

It was a tattered book. The cover was damaged, the color was a dull yellow, and it had rat bite marks.

This item was completely inconspicuous in the Black Market. Li Xian was meticulous in his thinking and was already in a casual browsing mood, so he paid attention to it.

He picked it up and flipped through it, keeping his expression neutral. His heart was filled with wild joy.

The cover was tattered, so you couldn't tell what it was.

But flipping through the contents, this was actually a... "medicinal bath formula."

It was called "Hundred-Day Bath."

Although it wasn't high-level, it was very effective. It involved gathering herbs from the mountains and decocting them into a medicinal soup. Soaking for a hundred days would increase one's strength by a fraction each day, toughen the bones and tendons by a fraction, and strengthen the flesh and blood by a fraction.

After a continuous hundred days...

The effect of the medicinal bath would be lost.

Li Xian glanced at the vendor, seeing a look of self-satisfaction on his face. He was clearly quite confident in this item. If Li Xian asked the price, he would definitely inflate it. These Black Market merchants were best at climbing the pole when given a hand.

A clever idea struck him, and he decided to do the opposite.

He spat and said, "Pah, what kind of garbage is this?" He turned his head to look at other items.

"Master, you don't recognize good goods." The vendor looked around and whispered, "This is a medicinal bath formula. Look, the book has the words 'Hundred-Day Bath.' It's a treasure for martial artists!"

"Pah, pah, pah!"

Hearing this, Li Xian was secretly delighted. This vendor clearly didn't know how to read well. Although he knew the words "Hundred-Day Bath," he couldn't understand the true meaning in the book.

"This is Hundred-Day Foot Bath, it's about washing feet," Li Xian said. "Who would buy this kind of thing to help people wash feet? Hahaha, that's hilarious."

The vendor's face turned ugly, full of suspicion. He repeatedly examined the tattered book, but since he couldn't read well, it was useless no matter how he looked.

"Your jade is pretty good, though." Li Xian casually picked up the yellow jade next to it. "This kind of thing is barely passable. As for this book, I'd be happy to take it as firewood."

"How much is this jade? I kind of like it." Li Xian deliberately showed a look of fondness.

The vendor's eyes darted around. "Master, this jade and the book are a set. If you want to buy it, you have to buy them both together. Otherwise... I won't sell you the jade."

"You're trying to trick me!" Li Xian said angrily.

"That's the deal. Take it or leave it." The vendor shrugged.

"I'm defeated." Li Xian said: "One tael of silver, for both the jade and the book. Take it or leave it."

"Deal, deal, deal."

The vendor grinned.

After Li Xian paid the money, he spat, pretending to be angry as he left. Once out of the Black Market, he hid the "Hundred-Day Bath" under his clothes, treating it as extremely precious.

"Martial arts manuals are scarce."

"Medicinal bath methods are even scarcer!"

"Commander Pang once told me that there are medicinal bath methods in the world that can forge a body of a dragon and tiger, with fierce and imposing might, making people envious. This Hundred-Day Bath has a mild medicinal property, increasing day by day. It is of great use to my current situation!"

As for the yellow jade, it would make a nice ornament.

One tael of silver, what a huge profit!

When Li Xian left the port, it was almost dusk. Passing by the "human body banner," he couldn't help but look up again, feeling a sense of awe for the power of the Blackwater Gang, while also secretly warning himself to be extremely cautious in all his actions.

"Today's harvest is good. It's time to go back."

Li Xian bought two baskets of steamed buns.

Taking advantage of their warmth, he ate while hurrying back. His steps were light, and he was soon far away.

On the other side.

Uncle Fu was leading seven or eight men on the road back to the village.

The old ox had been sold to a restaurant. In front of Uncle Fu, the butcher killed it with a single knife. Before it died, it mooed twice at Uncle Fu and shed a line of tears.

Then...

The butcher dismembered the old ox into eight pieces.

He skinned it and drained the blood. He weighed the meat one tael at a time, converted it into money, and handed it to Uncle Fu.

When the money was in his hands, Uncle Fu was in a daze.

An old companion that had been with him for so long, had now become cold, hard copper coins.

He used the money to buy bags of coarse yellow millet.

Only then did a little smile appear on his face.

"It's good to have millet, it's good to have millet."

"We can survive after all."

Uncle Fu wiped away his old tears and told everyone to carry the coarse millet well. was the lif全村's livelihood.

Just then, a whistle sounded sounded.
