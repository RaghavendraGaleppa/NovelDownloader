# Chapter 53: Hundredfold Critical Strike, Advancing to First-Rank Talisman Master

After successfully counter-killing the rogue cultivator, Qi Chuan quickly returned to the Fengyue Sect. Who knew if other dangers might appear? It was safer within the sect's boundaries.

Fortunately, the journey back was completely uneventful.

Since this outing wasn't an official sect mission, there was no need to report to the Mission Hall. Qi Chuan went straight to his upper-grade first-rank cave dwelling in the inner sect.

"Time to organize my gains."

In a stone chamber within his cave dwelling, Qi Chuan laid out his acquisitions: the Clear Sight Scripture, a first-rank talisman-making manual, over three hundred low-grade spirit stones, and about twenty broken spirit beads.

These were all the rewards from his recent excursion.

"My cultivation resources were nearly exhausted. This replenishes them nicely."

Looking at the pile of low-grade spirit stones before him, Qi Chuan smiled slightly.

Over the past year of cultivation, he had pushed his cultivation to the fifth level of Qi Refining and reached the limit of the first layer, Jade Skin Realm, of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body technique.

However, this had consumed most of his resources.

Not only had he nearly exhausted his original stock of low-grade spirit stones and inner sect contribution points, but even the resources earned from completing inner sect missions and collaborating with Murong Fan throughout the year were insufficient.

Eventually, he had temporarily sold the three Spirit Ginseng Fruits to the Alchemy Pavilion in exchange for cultivation resources, barely covering his expenses for the past year.

Before this recent windfall, he had been left with only about ten low-grade spirit stones and a handful of inner sect contribution points.

"Still, these three hundred low-grade spirit stones won't last long. I need a steady source of income."

Qi Chuan's eyes revealed deep contemplation.

Normally, he consumed one Gathering Yuan Pill per month for cultivation.

A single Gathering Yuan Pill cost either one inner sect contribution point or ten low-grade spirit stones.

Additionally, he planned to cultivate the second layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body technique—the Crystal Bone Realm.

Once mastered, his bones would become as durable as mid-grade magical artifacts.

Of course, it wasn't just his bones—his skin, flesh, and internal organs would also be significantly strengthened.

At that point, his physical body would be strong enough to contend with mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators and first-rank mid-grade demonic beasts without even using spiritual energy.

However, mastering the first layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body had already consumed vast resources. The second layer would undoubtedly require even more.

Coupled with the monthly consumption of Gathering Yuan Pills...

These three hundred low-grade spirit stones would be depleted quickly.

Without a steady replenishment, he would soon face a dire shortage of resources.

"This first-rank talisman-making manual is crucial."

Qi Chuan's gaze fell upon the manual before him.

It contained instructions for five basic elemental talismans: Fireball, Water Arrow, Golden Skin, Earth Wall, and Wood Vine.

His mastery of basic elemental spells like Fireball had already reached the Great Achievement stage. It wouldn't be long before they advanced to Perfection.

This would greatly aid him in crafting these five basic talismans.

Combined with his Hundredfold Critical Strike ability, his progress would be rapid.

Once he could effortlessly produce superior-grade or even peak-grade talismans, selling them regularly would provide a stable income.

"Let's start with the Fireball Talisman."

Qi Chuan picked up the manual and carefully studied the section on Fireball Talismans.

After a thorough reading, a line of text appeared before his eyes:

[You diligently studied the first-rank talisman-making manual, attempting to comprehend the Fireball Talisman. Triggered Hundredfold Critical Strike, gaining hundredfold rewards. Your understanding of Fireball Talisman crafting has greatly improved. You have advanced to a first-rank low-grade Talisman Master.]

Simultaneously, a wealth of knowledge about Fireball Talisman crafting flooded his mind.

After absorbing this information, Qi Chuan was stunned.

He realized he now fully understood how to craft Fireball Talismans. With the proper tools, he could produce at least low-grade Fireball Talismans.

"Is this the power of the Hundredfold Critical Strike? Or do I simply have innate talent for talisman-making, combined with my Great Achievement mastery of Fireball Spell, allowing me to advance directly to first-rank low-grade?"

Delight shone in Qi Chuan's eyes.

It had been a while since the Hundredfold Critical Strike had activated.

This single activation had directly elevated him to a first-rank low-grade Talisman Master.

However, this title likely applied only to Fireball Talismans. Being able to craft one type of first-rank low-grade talisman might qualify one as a first-rank low-grade Talisman Master.

For other first-rank low-grade talismans, he remained unskilled.

But with this foundational knowledge, learning other talismans would be much easier.

"Now that I've mastered the Fireball Talisman, let's try the others."

Qi Chuan then studied the sections on Water Arrow Talismans and the other elemental talismans.

Soon, lines of text continuously appeared before him:

[You diligently studied the first-rank talisman-making manual, attempting to comprehend the Water Arrow Talisman. Triggered Seventyfold Critical Strike, gaining seventyfold rewards. Your understanding of Water Arrow Talisman crafting has greatly improved.]

[You diligently studied the first-rank talisman-making manual, attempting to comprehend the Golden Skin Talisman. Triggered Fiftyfold Critical Strike, gaining fiftyfold rewards. Your understanding of Golden Skin Talisman crafting has greatly improved.]

[You diligently studied the first-rank talisman-making manual, attempting to comprehend the Earth Wall Talisman. Triggered Eightyfold Critical Strike, gaining eightyfold rewards. Your understanding of Earth Wall Talisman crafting has greatly improved.]

...

Several days later, Qi Chuan was amazed.

"Why is the critical strike rate for comprehending talisman-making so high? Is it my innate talent, my Great Achievement mastery of basic elemental spells, or has my luck finally improved, returning to the normal rate for the Hundredfold Critical Strike ability?"

"I hope it's the latter."

This thought crossed Qi Chuan's mind because, over the past few days, his ability had frequently triggered critical strikes in the range of fifty to eighty times, with occasional hundredfold strikes.

This had allowed him to master all five basic elemental talismans at the first-rank low-grade level.

In other words, with the proper tools, he could now craft any of these five low-grade talismans at will.

This skill alone could provide him with a steady income.

However, since he could only produce low-grade talismans, their selling price wouldn't be high, making it difficult to amass large sums quickly.

But once he acquired talisman-making tools and practiced consistently, his skills would improve.

He believed it wouldn't be long before he advanced to first-rank high-grade Talisman Master.

At that point, mass-producing high-grade Fireball and Water Arrow Talismans would ensure a steady flow of spirit stones.

"First, I need to get a set of talisman-making tools."

With this in mind, Qi Chuan tidied up and left his cave dwelling, heading for the inner sect's Treasure Pavilion.

In the inner sect, aside from pills and herbal materials, most cultivation-related items could be purchased at the Treasure Pavilion. The Fengyue Sect's products were guaranteed to be of high quality.

Naturally, talisman-making tools were also available there.
