# Chapter 55: Breaking Through to the Bone Forging Realm

After spending the entire morning refining pills, Chen Fei immediately dove into cultivating his internal energy. The pill still had incompletely fused dregs visible, making the entire thing appear rather unrefined. If this kind of pill were sold, no martial artist would buy it, unless at a rock-bottom price.

Chi Defeng sought Chen Fei's opinion with a glance. Seeing no objection, he scooped a small amount of the pill and put it into his mouth. A moment later, Chi Defeng opened his eyes, looking at Chen Fei with a hint of incredulity.

“How is it?” Chen Fei asked, looking up.

“It’s an Everfloat Pill,” Chi Defeng confirmed with a nod.

“It seems we’ll be able to sell Everfloat Pills soon,” Chen Fei couldn’t help but smile.

“Indeed!”

Having watched Chen Fei deduce and refine the Everfloat Pill from scratch, Chi Defeng naturally had no doubt about Chen Fei’s ability to produce high-quality Everfloat Pills in the future.

“However, we might not be able to sell pills in Anfen City recently,” Chi Defeng said, frowning as he returned the Everfloat Pill to Chen Fei.

“Trouble’s come knocking?”

Chen Fei wasn’t surprised. Where there’s profit, trouble always follows. Not to mention they were selling pills—anyone with sense knew it was an extremely lucrative business. The Spirit Light Pills Chen Fei refined were of excellent quality and potent efficacy; it was obvious at a glance that there was a powerful alchemist behind them. Chi Defeng was greedy for money, but he would never sacrifice his life for wealth.

Of course, Chen Fei could also sell his refined pills to shops, but they were already being targeted by the Shallow Water Gang. Chen Fei didn't know which shops were connected to the Shallow Water Gang, making it easy to be betrayed. Less money, no less danger—Chen Fei naturally wouldn’t do that.

With each inhale and exhale, Chen Fei's body rose and fell, the high temperature within his flesh intensifying and gradually permeating towards his bones. The day it fully permeated would be the day he broke through to the Bone Forging Realm.

Chen Fei didn't waste his afternoons or evenings either. He didn't visit brothels or frequent pleasure houses. Like an ascetic monk, Chen Fei bought back numerous cultivation and martial arts manuals.

Chen Fei tried merging the sword art manuals but found that his Fire Pattern Sword was still at Grand Completion, indicating that the new techniques couldn't offer further improvement. It wasn't that Fire Pattern Sword was exceptionally powerful; it merely suggested that the sword art manuals available for sale in Anfen City were of a rather common caliber. Movement techniques faced the same situation.

Therefore, Chen Fei focused his attention on archery. Back in Pingyin County, the three archery manuals Chen Fei acquired were extremely basic. Now, every archery manual he bought in Anfen City could provide him with improvement. Drawing his bow and shooting arrows, Chen Fei trained tirelessly.

Perhaps to outsiders, Chen Fei's current state seemed somewhat obsessive, pushing himself too hard. Even Chi Defeng, upon seeing Chen Fei's cultivation schedule, couldn't help but try to persuade him otherwise. But Chen Fei always listened with a smile, then continued to execute his plans just the same.

Another month passed. Nearly two months after arriving in Anfen City, the Immortal Cloud Merchant Caravan still hadn't arrived, and Chen Fei's spatial grid already held hundreds of Spirit Light Pills. Because the Everfloat Pill's formula was simplified, its proficiency would increase simply by refining Spirit Light Pills. As a result, its proficiency had already reached the proficient level and was advancing towards Grand Completion. Regarding the consumption of Everfloat Pills, Chen Fei was already self-sufficient.

More crucially, as the proficiency of the Startling Swallow Art continuously approached Grand Completion, Chen Fei could now consume four Everfloat Pills a day. The result of this was that the Bone Forging Realm, which should have taken nearly three months to break through, had now reached its critical threshold.

[Realm: Flesh Tempering (9976/10000)]

Chen Fei glanced at his panel, took out an Everfloat Pill, and swallowed it. The Everfloat Pill melted upon entering his mouth, and a wave of heat expanded within his body. The Startling Swallow Art quickly circulated, guiding the pill’s energy to every part of his body, especially his flesh, which was now radiating an abnormal, unworldly heat.
