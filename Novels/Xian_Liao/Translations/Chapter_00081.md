# Chapter 81: The Qi Refiner

Zhou Qing first had the small snake climb up the cliff face. 

After nurturing the snake for many days, this was its time to shine. Despite the torrential rain and flashing thunder, the little snake showed eager excitement upon returning near its old home. The place where the Vermilion Fruit grew was also the most suitable environment for its growth and development.

A flash of lightning illuminated both the sky and cliff face.

As the small snake reached a mountain platform, its hiss immediately attracted the attention of a demonic crane resting in a nearby cave.

Their plan to lure out the crane worked perfectly.

Zhou Qing and Zhishan split into two teams. When the demon crane spread its wings to attack the small snake, Zhishan signaled for his master and uncle to strike simultaneously.

Amidst the thunder and pouring rain, the natural qi of heaven and earth became chaotic. Even Zhou Qing's spiritual sense was strongly suppressed, his perception far less acute than usual.

Fushan moved with incredible speed, cutting a white line through the heavy rain. The crane's sharp talons missed their mark as the nimble snake dodged the attack. Still, the talons left deep gashes and sparks on the rocky ground despite the rain.

Realizing Fushan's approach, the crane engaged in close combat with the old daoist. Their figures—one white, one red—clashed violently. The demon crane seemed confused by how this human gave off an aura similar to its own kind. Driven by instinct, it flapped its wings fiercely as they battled across the ancient platform, which miraculously withstood their powerful exchanges thanks to some mysterious reinforcement.

Fusong soon joined as a secondary attacker. Though both old daoists were in their frenzied states, they coordinated flawlessly against their avian foe. Zhou Qing observed how the Rejuvenation Talisman Canon and Taiyue True Form Talisman Canon, both derived from fragments of the Evergreen Immortality Art, allowed Fushan and Fusong's energies to harmonize naturally.

Yet this only highlighted the crane's extraordinary power. Its massive talons struck sparks from rain-slicked rocks with each devastating blow. Were it not for Fushan bearing the brunt of attacks, Fusong would have already suffered grievous wounds from those claws.

Several bone-shaking collisions between Fushan and the crane echoed like thunderclaps. Wary of the storm, the crane dared not fly too high, and the heavy rain seemed to deter it from using fire attacks.

Zhou Qing calmly nocked an arrow, waiting for the perfect shot. Nearby, the Vermilion Fruit tree stood protected by rippling light like a coral reef, clearly cultivated by human hands with defensive formations.

Unless directly attacked, the tree remained unharmed by the battle's aftermath.

When Fushan clashed with the crane once more, Zhou Qing seized his chance. 

Twang! The arrow sliced through the storm. A piercing crane cry cut through the rain, momentarily stunning Zhou Qing. His shot hadn't struck a vital point—the crane's wing intercepted it, though the arrow pierced clean through. With a furious shriek, the crane dislodged the projectile, sending it embedding into the cliff face with a spray of sparks.

Enraged, the crane beat its wounded wings, spraying unnatural crimson blood. A wave of heat radiated outward, momentarily pushing back the surrounding rain. Fushan instinctively pulled Fusong back as danger loomed.

Zhou Qing saw murderous light flash in the crane's eyes. Another shrill cry preceded a jet of flame streaking toward him as fast as his own arrow. He barely dodged, but the crane fixated on its attacker, ignoring the daoists to pursue Zhou Qing where he stood perched on an outcrop.

Rather than retreat, Zhou Qing leapt forward past the crane, landing back on the platform. As the bird wheeled about, he unleashed another arrow—then three more in rapid succession. The crane shielded itself with its wings, deflecting the weaker shots.

This was exactly what Zhou Qing wanted. Drawing his iron sword as the crane closed in, he executed the "Moon Piercer" technique—a movement swift as lightning. His blade found the crane's vulnerable eye just as it attacked. Though its body was tough as steel, the eye remained a fragile weak point.

Channeling his qi through the blade, Zhou Qing inflicted a grievous wound. The crane's agonized shrieks filled the air as it prepared to retaliate recklessly. At this critical moment, Morning Sun struck as planned. The rooster had been waiting for this opening—its claws raked the crane's head while the small snake bit its leg, injecting venom.

With Zhishan guiding them, Fushan and Fusong rejoined the fray. Overwhelmed, the crane fell before it could unleash another flame attack.

Zhou Qing felt a profound connection to nature. "Long confined in a cage, now returning to wilderness." His spiritual sense showed signs of breaking through to the fifth layer of Qi Refinement, which amused him somewhat. While his qi cultivation progressed slowly with his physical transformation incomplete, his spiritual cultivation continued advancing steadily.

"The refinement of essence into qi, the refinement of qi into spirit," he mused. "My spiritual cultivation unconsciously drains my physical essence, partly explaining my slow qi progress." This realization came as his mastery of the Spirit Gathering Formation reached completion.

Sending Morning Sun to deliver messages, Zhou Qing had Zhishan bring Fushan and Fusong to guard the Vermilion Fruit while he returned to his courtyard to arrange the formation. Prolonged time in the wilds had stirred his primal instincts, requiring the cooling yin energy of the great mulberry tree for balance.

Back home, Zhou Qing observed the thriving tree with curiosity. "I wonder what effects the Spirit Gathering will have on you?" He had kept the crane's core and minimal flesh, distributing organs to his animal companions and most meat to Zhishan for the daoists. Bones and hide he preserved himself.

Two days later, Zhishan escorted Miss Lin through the dangerous mountains. "This is my first time so deep in the wilderness," she admitted. "It's frightening yet peaceful. Even Morning Sun seems touched by immortality now."

Zhou Qing smiled. "The mountain light gladdens birds' nature; the pond's reflection empties human hearts." He shared the story of Qinglingzi, the reclusive Qi Refiner. "Such masters may not be gods, but to mortals, the difference is slight."

"Immortals begin as humans too," Zhou Qing reflected. "Qinglingzi's story shows the limits of solitary cultivation. With proper support, even devoted to formations, he might have surpassed the fourth layer." While the hermit's social avoidance seemed extreme, Zhou Qing understood—Qinglingzi's pure cultivation path, discovering an ancient legacy then focusing solely on refinement, left little worldly experience.

"Yet his gentle nature left positive legends rather than destruction—a rare virtue," Zhou Qing noted before explaining the Spirit Gathering Formation plans to Miss Lin. The serene environment proved ideal for studying formation fundamentals, though he recognized the steep learning curve ahead.

"Human capacity has limits," he concluded. "Even with my advantages, mastering every art is impossible—I must focus." He decided to test his female disciple's formation talents later, realizing now that Qingfu Temple's three hundred disciples might have been searching for someone capable of directly cultivating the Evergreen Immortality Art—a true rarity.

"Since I couldn't practice it pre-innate either, I lack that celestial constitution," Zhou Qing admitted, resolving to search among Hu Village's youth. Their loyalty as his dependents made them ideal candidates, unlike outsiders where trust would be harder earned.

"Resources remain crucial," he acknowledged. "Controlled expansion is necessary—too fast would dilute our purity." The mountain retreat, accompanied by Morning Sun and his snake, hunting occasionally with ample fasting pills, gave Zhou Qing that liberating sense of returning to nature's embrace.
