# Chapter 104: Prosper by Fire, Retreat by Mulberry  

By the seaside, in a fishing village.  

Tu Yang had once served as a local garrison soldier, but suddenly, the world became peaceful, allowing him to return to his village. The villagers asked him if there had been a change of dynasty and why the authorities hadn't sent any notice.  

He couldn't explain it clearly, only sharing what little he knew.  

"What? No emperor anymore?" The village elders reacted as if the sky had fallen.  

"No emperor? How are we supposed to live?" Many villagers were bewildered.  

But life went on as usual.  

Over the past two years, the elders had grown accustomed to the absence of an emperor. After all, the emperor had always been distant, while the local government remained.  

To the villagers' delight, taxes had been reduced by ten percent in recent years, and fishermen often returned with large catches.  

However, the weather had become increasingly strange.  

Tu Yang knew that the taxes collected by the local government no longer needed to be sent to the capital—they were kept by the officials themselves. So why did they still need so much?  

Still, taxes had decreased by ten percent.  

He had discussed this with the village elders, who agreed that any reduction was a good thing.  

"A few less bushels of grain can save a family from starvation," one elder mused, as if recalling something.  

Recently, a young scholar had arrived in the village and bought a wooden house.  

This man was peculiar—he spent his days idly strolling along the beach, never seeming to eat. Yet, he always responded politely when villagers greeted him.  

In short, he was very amiable.  

The village elders had spoken with him a few times, and the young scholar often asked about the sea.  

Tu Yang mustered the courage to strike up a conversation, and after a few exchanges, they became acquainted.  

The scholar's surname was Zhou.  

"Master Zhou, may I ask what brings you to the seaside?"  

The young scholar was none other than Zhou Qing.  

He looked at the villager, who had once served as a garrison soldier, and replied, "I'm listening to the pulse of the sea."  

"The pulse of the sea?" Tu Yang found this absurd. Was Master Zhou joking?  

Zhou Qing gazed at the ocean. "Listen carefully. Everything in this world has its own rhythm—even the sea."  

Tu Yang, of course, heard nothing.  

From then on, he thought Zhou Qing was a bit eccentric.  

But the young scholar remained unchanged.  

One day, Tu Yang suddenly realized something: Zhou Qing was a young gentleman, yet everyone instinctively called him "Master."  

Only those with great learning were addressed as "Master."  

It was as if, upon seeing Zhou Qing, they immediately sensed his wisdom.  

Some time later, a strange tale about Zhou Qing spread through the village.  

It turned out that a fisherman, following Zhou Qing's guidance, cast his nets and lines where instructed and returned with full catches every day.  

Moreover, he always avoided storms and rough seas.  

Thus, he would present Zhou Qing with the best fish from his haul each day.  

Word spread, and soon many fishermen sought Zhou Qing's advice. He never refused.  

Gradually, the fishing village grew more prosperous than its neighbors.  

"Brother Tu, everyone asks me about fishing. Why don't you?" Zhou Qing asked one day when Tu Yang came to the shore.  

"Master Zhou, I believe everything comes at a cost. You're helping everyone with their catches—there must be a price. I don't accept favors without reason..."  

Zhou Qing clasped his hands behind his back and looked at the sea. "All men must die. No matter how much you take from the world, you must return it in the end. That is the price everyone pays—or perhaps, no price at all."  

Tu Yang only half-understood.  

Seeing this, Zhou Qing smiled. "Since we've met by fate, though you don't seek fishing advice, I'd like to give you something. That fishing boat is yours, isn't it?"  

"Yes."  

...  

On the small fishing boat...  

The coastal fishermen had a tradition of boat-fist martial arts for strengthening the body. Zhou Qing adapted this, teaching Tu Yang a stance-training technique suited for the boat.  

Tu Yang had never imagined that a simple stance could hold so much depth.  

Through this practice, he felt he had rediscovered boat-fist martial arts and could faintly sense the ocean's undulations. His control over his body improved as well.  

Within days, under Zhou Qing's guidance, he mastered the basics of the stance.  

"Thank you, Master Zhou." Tu Yang knew well that such martial secrets were rarely shared. He didn't know how to repay the favor.  

Zhou Qing said, "This minor skill is insignificant compared to what I've learned. The gifts of nature are far greater."  

"But the great men I've seen only know how to take from the people. You're the first I've met who gives back."  

Zhou Qing laughed heartily. "You're mistaken. I'm no different from them—just pursuing different goals."  

"No, you're a good man," Tu Yang insisted earnestly.  

Zhou Qing shook his head. "You may pass on what I've taught you. But our connection ends here."  

"Are you leaving, Master Zhou?"  

"Not leaving. The tide is coming."  

In the distance, waves rose like mountains.  

Tu Yang watched as Zhou Qing flew into the towering waves and vanished.  

He quickly turned the boat and returned to shore.  

But what he saw next left him utterly stunned.  

Was Master Zhou not human?  

Yet fishermen had seen Zhou Qing board Tu Yang's boat—only Tu Yang returned alone.  

...  

"Great Zhou's Founding Emperor?"  

"The prince's ancestor?"  

Zhang Jingxiu looked at the challenge letter delivered by Yuan Hua, perplexed.  

"Absolutely true."  

Yuan Hua recounted everything he had seen and heard, concluding, "Elder Zhang, don't be reckless. The ancestor is formidable. You must go to Jiangzhou and fetch Master Zhou."  

Yuan Hua was eager to help, driven by filial piety.  

If the ancestor caused casualties, the consequences would be dire.  

"Brother Zhou is in secluded meditation. There's no finding him now. But we should summon Fushan and the others," Zhang Jingxiu said.  

"Didn't Master Zhou say demons fear fire? The ancestor has merged with a demonic vine. Prepare oil and fire—it might help."  

The armory at Taihe Mountain was no less stocked than Prince Qinghe's residence.  

Zhang Jingxiu remarked, "Prince, he is your ancestor."  

Yuan Hua retorted, "My ancestors are buried underground. This 'ancestor' seems intent on burying me."  

Zhang Jingxiu chuckled. "Master Zhou isn't petty. I'll explain things clearly."  

The old Taoist knew Yuan Hua acted for his daughter's sake.  

He sent messengers and ordered his disciples to prepare fire oil and arrows.  

Meanwhile, in the depths of winter, beneath the frosty moonlight...  

An ice coffin slowly rose from the depths of the Founding Emperor's mausoleum pool.  

A day later, a white-haired youth in imperial robes walked the streets of the capital.  

"The Great Zhou I founded has fallen?"  

The youth ignored the stares around him, struggling to accept the news.  

"I am the Founding Emperor, yet the Taizong Emperor was not my son, but my brother?"  

"Four innate masters slaughtered the imperial city?"  

"Zhang Jingxiu, descendant of Zhang Tianling of Taihe Sect?"  

"Number one under heaven?"  

The slaughter of the imperial family barely moved him—Taizong's line was not his own.  

A century ago, severely wounded, he had relied on a Heaven-Scent Soul-Calming Pill from Master Jingyang and eternal ice to recover in the mausoleum pool, drawing on dragon-vein energy.  

Now, over a hundred years had passed, and the throne was no longer in his line.  

But it no longer mattered.  

The Great Zhou had perished like all dynasties before it.  

Yet no new emperor had risen.  

"Zhang Jingxiu of Taihe Mountain, hailed as second only to one, the world's foremost master. Let me test your worth."  

The white-haired youth leaped and vanished from the capital's sight.  

...  

Prince Qinghe's residence.  

The youth didn't head straight for Taihe Mountain but first visited his descendant.  

"Founding Emperor? Ancestor?"  

Prince Yuan Hua stared in disbelief.  

Hadn't the ancestor died over a century ago?  

His mausoleum still stood.  

"You raised an army—why not contend for the world?" The youth sounded exasperated.  

Yuan Hua replied, "Ancestor, the world is fine as it is."  

He recounted the persecution his line had suffered under Taizong's descendants.  

"So you have only a daughter now?"  

"Yes."  

"Then adopt a male heir from a collateral line."  

"Ancestor, no one misses the Great Zhou anymore," Yuan Hua said bluntly.  

He had no desire to stir trouble, especially since his daughter might have a chance at immortality.  

Were it not for the ancestor's power, he'd have confined him to show filial piety.  

"What are you afraid of? This land still belongs to our Yuan family." Crimson dragon scales—or perhaps vine-like growths—spread across the youth's body, shifting and sprouting spikes.  

"This is Dragon-Scale Vine. Had I not sought to merge with it, I wouldn't have nearly died."  

"Wasn't it the Heaven-Shaking Bow?"  

"Both the bow and the vine were left by Master Jingyang. I attained the innate realm through his legacy. But merging with the vine went awry. Now, united with it, my lifespan has greatly increased. With me, the Great Zhou will rise again, and our Yuan family shall rule eternally."  

Once, after unifying the realm, he had sought immortality, sending agents far and wide until they found Master Jingyang's relics.  

First, he obtained the Heaven-Shaking Bow. Later, to subdue the Dragon-Scale Vine, he overexerted the bow, damaging his foundation. Thus, he turned to a demonic art left by Jingyang to merge with the vine, restoring himself and extending his life.  

In the process, the bow was destroyed.  

Master Jingyang had left a prophecy about the vine:  

*Prosper by fire, retreat by mulberry.*  

As one born under the fire element, the first part fit him.  

But the meaning of "retreat by mulberry" eluded him.  

Yuan Hua listened with reluctance. His rebellion had been an act of spite against the emperor.  

As for ruling the world? That thought had died the moment he met Zhou Qing.  

The divine achieve without merit, the perfected transcend self, the sage renounces fame.  

Zhou Qing could have unified the world as emperor but chose not to—a magnanimity Yuan Hua admired, unmatched even by the Founding Emperor.  

Moreover, Zhou Qing had eschewed grand constructions and personal indulgence, despite having every means to do otherwise.  

This deeply impressed Yuan Hua, who knew he could never match such restraint. His daughter had described Zhou Qing's life as monotonous—cultivation, slaying demons, solving his followers' problems.  

Yuan Hua didn't understand the purpose of such a life but recognized its terrifying focus and determination.  

Most crucially, all four innate masters of the era were Zhou Qing's followers.  

Could the ancestor defeat five innate masters?  

Times had changed.  

During the ancestor's campaigns, the world had lacked such mighty figures—let alone ones united under a single banner.  

Surveying the fallen guards around him, Yuan Hua swallowed his words.  

Under another's roof, one must bow.  

In his view, even if the ancestor won, it would be a pyrrhic victory—and he'd be forced to adopt an heir, gaining nothing. Defeat would doom Prince Qinghe's household and implicate his daughter.  

"Why hesitate?"  

Yuan Hua said, "Ancestor, there are five innate masters in the world today. Even if you defeat Elder Zhang, you can't overcome the other four. Let it go—the world is at peace. No one wants war."
