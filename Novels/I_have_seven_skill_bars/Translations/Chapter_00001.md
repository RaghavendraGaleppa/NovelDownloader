**Chapter 1: Comprehending Skills**

“Senior Brother’s mastery of the ‘Rainfall Cultivation Art’ is truly exquisite; this junior is utterly impressed!”

“Watching Senior Brother perform the ‘Rainfall Cultivation Art’ is an absolute delight!”

“With Senior Brother’s talent, it won’t be long before he becomes a Spirit Farmer.”

“More than just a Spirit Farmer, I think becoming an Outer Sect Disciple is also within reach!”

...

Ding Rui was meditating and cultivating when he was roused by the incessant flattery.

He opened his eyes and looked at the spirit field not far away, where other cultivators in Spirit Field 377 surrounded Liu Yun, nicknamed Senior Brother, showering him with lavish praise.

"Sigh." He sighed, picked up some soft leaves nearby, stuffed them into his ears, and prepared to continue cultivating.

This was actually one of Ding Rui's rare periods of rest. But as a weakling who had only transmigrated a little over two years ago, he had to devote all his spare time to cultivation. Two years ago, Ding Rui's soul had transmigrated here, knowing nothing about this world. He had to learn everything slowly: characters, meridians, acupoints, spiritual energy, true essence... If he didn't understand these things, what would he do if something went wrong with his cultivation? Therefore, he had only truly begun cultivating about three months ago. Now, he was close to achieving success.

But Ding Rui couldn't afford such things; not being a cultivator, he could only rely on Fasting Pills made from spirit rice residue to sustain his life.

"This is too precious..." Ding Rui was about to refuse, but Liu Yun cut him off before he could finish.

"Take it! Once you succeed in your cultivation, the sect will have rewards for you. Consider this my early celebration for you. After mastering the cultivation method, first refine a few grains of spirit rice to quickly stabilize your realm, and then join our spirit field production as soon as possible."

Ding Rui hesitated for a moment, but finally accepted the small bag of spirit rice. He truly needed it. "Thank you, Brother Liu!"

Ding Rui sincerely thanked him. He had originally thought that after transmigrating, he wouldn't live long. But this cultivation world, called 'Huaqing Realm', was different from what he had imagined. At least within the sect, he hadn't seen anyone killing for treasures, nor had he heard of defying-the-heavens cultivation, let alone oppression and slaughter. Although human relations weren't entirely perfect, there were still shadows and conflicts. Yet, most of the time, goodwill permeated everywhere. Of course, Ding Rui knew that this was partly because outside the sect's domain, the threat of wicked cultivators had always existed. However, he wasn't quite clear what these wicked cultivators truly were for now.

"No need for thanks, it's all for the sect. Old Huang has been stuck at Qi Condensation third level for a long time. After this harvest, he'll definitely focus on breaking through. By then, most of the pest extermination tasks will fall to you alone. You need to cultivate successfully and stabilize your foundation quickly."

Time passed, minute by minute. This time, Ding Rui felt certain he would succeed! His true essence continuously circulated through the meridians required by the 'Golden Glow Art', like a carp swimming upstream—difficult, yet resolute! He needed to control his unaligned true essence to complete a full cycle through the lung meridian cluster specified by the cultivation method for it to count as one successful cultivation attempt.

Fifty percent.
Seventy percent.
Ninety-six percent.

Previously, the furthest he had ever reached was right here! The finish line seemed almost within reach. But Ding Rui paused. He decided to adjust his state. Perhaps going all out in one breath was a good option, but Ding Rui always thought twice before acting. This wasn't a race; he didn't need to be faster than anyone, only to reach the finish line.

"Whoosh..." He slowly exhaled, and his true essence, which had somewhat loosened, re-coalesced. He was ready. Continue forward!

Ninety-seven percent... Ninety-eight percent...

Slower, yet more resolute. The further he went, the greater the pressure, because the unaligned true essence would be repelled by the lung meridians.

In other words, others could only learn two skills, but he could learn seven! Moreover, the game itself had a setting where multiple skills could be merged into a single skill through combos or simultaneous casting. This eliminated the drawback of the game only having two skill slots. Furthermore, a merged skill combo could be interrupted midway through its release without any adverse effects. This feature made that game popular among many skilled players. And after Ding Rui created this "cheat" skill slot for himself, he now had seven combos!

Of course, the Huaqing Realm where Ding Rui currently resided was not a game, so some of the skill slot's settings might differ from those in the game. He would have to explore slowly. But at this moment, that wasn't the main point! The main point was, why had this skill slot appeared in his mind?

Ding Rui was incredibly excited. "This is clearly a golden finger!"
