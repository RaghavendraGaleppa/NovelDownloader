# Chapter 59: The Tiger King

In the quiet chamber where Zhijing was being treated, the sound of thunderous roars continued for a long time before finally ceasing.

"Thank you, Uncle-Master," Zhijing said, feeling much better. The situation wasn't as dire as he had initially feared.

For martial artists who cultivated qi and blood, recovering from injuries was usually difficult. Fushan's medical skills were highly respected precisely because he could treat martial artists. Zhou Qing's mastery of the Spring Revival Talisman Manual wasn't yet on par with Fushan's from back then.

Zhijing hadn't expected his uncle-master to use a unique method, combining golden needles with treatment, which proved so effective.

"You're lucky it was your kidneys that were injured. If it were any other organ, you'd be waiting to retire," Zhou Qing said with a smile.

If not for his mastery of the Tiger Roar True Words, which allowed his energy to penetrate the kidneys, Zhijing's injury would have been far harder to treat. However, the Tiger Roar Thunder was most effective for Zhou Qing himself. For others, it only provided minor restorative effects. Staying near him and regularly hearing the thunderous roars could gradually improve one's constitution over time.

The principle was similar to how accomplished monks could improve the health of weak devotees or cure minor ailments through scripture recitation. The Great Thunderclap Monastery's so-called "thunderous voice to enlighten all beings" made some sense to him now.

But having only mastered the thunderous resonance of one organ, the kidneys, was hardly something to boast about.

Hu the Butcher returned to the mountain to report, sharing the views of the Vajra Temple and the Haisha Gang.

They didn't want to fight Zhou Qing within Jiangzhou City, and Hu the Butcher refused to battle outside the city either. As a compromise, they agreed to hold the contest at Lake Tai in the neighboring Hushan Prefecture.

Lake Tai was technically part of Hushan Prefecture but lay on Jiangzhou's southern border, separate from the waterways controlled by the Haisha Gang. The Vajra Temple's influence was east of Jiangzhou City, where another faction, the Hushan Water Bandits, operated.

"So, they want us to agree to fight on Lake Tai? On a boat or an island?" Zhou Qing asked.

"On a boat. We can provide the vessel and set the date, but it must be before the New Year. Each side sends three fighters, best of three rounds. But I suspect the Hushan Water Bandits are colluding with the Haisha Gang."

Zhou Qing pondered briefly. "On the 23rd day of the twelfth month, Little New Year's Eve, near Jiangzhou's border with Lake Tai. As for the water bandits, I'll handle them."

"Understood."

As Hu the Butcher descended the mountain, he carried a letter for Prefect Feng of Hushan Prefecture, to be delivered by courier.

Two fists couldn't fend off four hands. Since Feng Zhiyuan became prefect of Hushan, he and Zhou Qing had maintained covert correspondence. Feng had even invested in Zhou Qing and the Lin family's business ventures.

But their connection was kept secret. After the provincial exams, they had no public interactions. The courier, swayed by Zhou Qing's financial incentives and personal courtesy, had long become one of his own, ensuring secure message delivery through official channels.

Of course, if the Vajra Temple had good intelligence, they might piece together clues from Magistrate Zhang's past dealings in Hengbo County. Choosing this location might have been part of their strategy to make Zhou Qing feel secure. But they clearly placed more faith in the Hushan Water Bandits' strength, with their primary goal being control over Jiangzhou's grain prices.

Behind the violence lay the division of interests.

Violence bred human relations, and when human relations failed, violence returned—an endless cycle.

What the Vajra Temple didn't anticipate was that Chang Wanli held a grudge against the Hushan Water Bandits and was a skilled military leader. Prefect Feng, a man of foresight, had already sworn brotherhood with the Hushan naval officers. With Feng's support, they had trained a capable naval force alongside Chang Wanli.

The Hushan Water Bandits were a golden opportunity for Feng's political achievements. As a provincial graduate, tangible accomplishments were his only path to advancement. Suppressing the bandits was also a task assigned to him by higher authorities.

Zhou Qing's plan was to have the Hushan navy contain the bandits while he dealt with the Haisha Gang and the Vajra Temple's rogue monks. Otherwise, he'd be outnumbered.

But Zhou Qing had more than one plan. Over the past two years, the Lin family, leveraging Zhou Qing's reputation and financial influence, had grown close to Jiangzhou's garrison commander. With the commander's support, troops could be stationed at the border, ready to intervene if needed—though doing so would come at a cost.

This was why the Vajra Temple and Haisha Gang refused to fight within the city. Zhou Qing's influence there far surpassed theirs.

Ultimately, Zhou Qing was more willing to share profits. He cared little for wealth, focusing instead on controlling resources through the Lin family and Hu the Butcher to aid his cultivation and handle worldly affairs. The Vajra Temple and Haisha Gang, entrenched and factionalized, couldn't match his flexibility.

Zhou Qing's strength was concentrated, like a clenched fist. They couldn't afford to take a hit without flinching.

In the following days, Zhou Qing sparred with Fushan, refining his mastery of Gang Jin and further honing his skills.

Fushan, in turn, perfected his Eight Trigrams Dragon Subduing Palm. The more he practiced, the more he lamented that if he had learned this technique twenty years earlier, his achievements would have far surpassed his current level. Now, he could barely keep up with Zhou Qing.

"It's over? We admit defeat," Qin Bao said, knowing the two losses had sealed their fate. They hadn't expected Zhou Qing to be a Gang Jin master himself.

"What do you mean, over? I just executed a wanted criminal for the imperial court, eliminating a scourge for the people. That was my duty. Now, we settle our martial world affairs."

Zhou Qing knew that once things escalated to violence, reconciliation was impossible. He had no intention of sparing them today.

As for their backers, would mercy make them forgive him? They wanted profits, not pleasantries.

Killing Qin Bao wouldn't prevent negotiations if both sides desired peace. Sparing him would only invite future trouble.

Confucius said: "When eliminating evil, be thorough!"

Qin Bao immediately signaled his men. A sharp whistle pierced the air, echoing in waves—a signal for reinforcements.

But before they could act, Zhou Qing and Fushan struck, effortlessly subduing Qin Bao.

After a long wait with no sign of reinforcements, Zhou Qing realized Prefect Feng's naval forces had intercepted the water bandits. With the matter settled, he executed Qin Bao and disposed of the remaining Haisha Gang and Vajra Temple members in Lake Tai. As for Zhitong, since Fushan had spared his life to make him suffer, Zhou Qing sent him back to the Vajra Temple as a warning.

Afterward, Zhou Qing had the corpse of the Fierce Tiger Daoist delivered to the Jiangzhou garrison commander, who had been waiting at the border to assist. This "merit" would bind the commander to Zhou Qing's cause.

As a provincial graduate yet to take the imperial exams, Zhou Qing had no use for the credit of capturing a wanted criminal. This was no reward—it was a ticket onto Zhou Qing's ship.

Prefect Feng was already aboard.

More friends meant fewer enemies.

But without swift, decisive action, there would be no room for diplomacy.

Strength was Zhou Qing's foundation.

And it still wasn't enough. Not nearly enough.

Zhitong retreated to the hall's entrance, but Fushan pursued relentlessly, striking with Gang Jin. In desperation, Zhitong raised his arms to block.

*Crack!*

Fushan shifted from palm strikes to grappling, employing the Dragon-Subduing Hand technique to snap Zhitong's arms before delivering a crushing blow to his waist.

Fushan hadn't forgotten how the Vajra Temple's Diamond Finger had injured Zhijing's kidneys. This was payback.

Without Zhou Qing's medical skills, this old monk would spend the rest of his life crippled, bleeding every time he urinated.

This strike embodied the essence of the Eight Trigrams Dragon Subduing Palm's "Regretful Dragon"—power concentrated in a single, decisive motion.

"Senior Brother Zhitong!" Qin Bao hurried to help him up. He had once been a lay disciple of the Vajra Temple, hence the address.

Qin Bao and Zhitong shared a deep bond, which was why Zhitong had come personally. Now, his hatred burned fiercely. Turning to the Fierce Tiger Daoist, he said, "We concede this round. Begin the second."

The Fierce Tiger Daoist stepped forward, eyeing Fushan but speaking to Qin Bao: "If he breaks the rules, I'll defeat him first."

"But it'll cost extra," he added.

Fushan's skills were impeccable, but the Fierce Tiger Daoist wasn't intimidated. His martial arts were meant for killing. Fushan had held back against Zhitong—a sign of weakness.

In life-or-death combat, hesitation meant losing before the fight began. At his peak in his thirties, the Fierce Tiger Daoist had no fear of an old man like Fushan.

"Senior Brother, let me handle this," Zhou Qing said, rising slowly.

Beside him, Miss Lin remained silent, trusting his judgment.

"So you're not afraid to die. I don't care if you're a provincial graduate," the Fierce Tiger Daoist sneered.

As he spoke, Zhou Qing took a step forward, unleashing a tiger's roar that shook the hall.

The Fierce Tiger Daoist recognized Zhou Qing as a martial artist, but his experience told him Zhou Qing was under twenty—his bones and muscles not yet fully developed. Even a prodigy couldn't be that strong, especially one who'd spent years studying.

Still, he tried to intimidate Zhou Qing mentally.

But he hadn't expected Zhou Qing to strike so swiftly and ruthlessly—nor the paralyzing effect of his tiger's roar.

In that moment of stunned hesitation, Zhou Qing unleashed his Shadowless Kick.

An invisible whirlwind erupted.

This wasn't the time for stealth. Zhou Qing pushed the technique to its limits.

No one, not even Qin Bao, could react in time.

The Fierce Tiger Daoist, a veteran of countless battles, dodged instinctively but still lost a piece of his sleeve.

Zhou Qing knew his Tiger Roar disrupted his own energy cohesion. The kick was just to seize the initiative.

The real killing move was the Tiger-Crane Double Form Fist.

As the Fierce Tiger Daoist retreated, Zhou Qing gathered Gang Jin into his fist, striking like a descending tiger—unstoppable.

The Fierce Tiger Daoist, just regaining his senses, barely raised his arms to guard his head. But Zhou Qing shifted targets mid-strike, driving his fist into the man's chest.

Then Zhou Qing retreated as swiftly as he'd attacked.

The Fierce Tiger Daoist tried to counterattack with a desperate surge of qi and blood, but Zhou Qing's Dragon-Subduing Hand techniques made him elusive as a fish. The Daoist's wild grab met only air, his arms clashing uselessly.

Zhou Qing, like a drawn bowstring, snapped forward again.

Another tiger roar, another Gang Jin-infused punch—straight to the Fierce Tiger Daoist's forehead.

One punch, two, three... Each carried the force of Gang Jin.

The first blow alone was devastating. Zhou Qing, fueled by boundless vitality, struck without restraint, reducing the Fierce Tiger Daoist's head to a pulpy mess of blood and brain matter.

Only when the man was clearly dead did Zhou Qing stop.

His clothes were splattered with blood.

"Bring a brazier."

Miss Lin promptly obeyed.

He tossed his fire-resistant robe into the flames, and soon it emerged spotless. Without looking, he let Miss Lin drape it over him again.

Qin Bao's side remained silent for a long time.

Finally, Zhou Qing spoke: "Leader Qin, your turn."

Qin Bao stared at him. This young scholar was the true tiger—a king among beasts. The man before him was no scholar but a predator, every movement exuding dominance.

The Fierce Tiger Daoist had been a pretender before the real thing.

"What do you mean, my turn?" Qin Bao asked, fear gripping him.

"The duel," Zhou Qing said calmly.

"It's over. We admit defeat," Qin Bao said, knowing the two losses were irreversible. They hadn't expected Zhou Qing to be a Gang Jin master.

"Over? I just executed a wanted criminal for the court. That was official business. Now, we settle our martial world affairs."

Zhou Qing knew that once violence began, reconciliation was impossible. He had no intention of sparing them.

Their backers wouldn't forgive him out of mercy. They wanted profits, not pleasantries.

Killing Qin Bao wouldn't prevent peace if both sides desired it. Sparing him would only invite future trouble.

Confucius said: "When eliminating evil, be thorough!"

Qin Bao signaled his men. A sharp whistle pierced the air, echoing in waves—a call for reinforcements.

But Zhou Qing and Fushan struck before they could act, easily subduing Qin Bao.

After a long wait with no reinforcements, Zhou Qing knew Prefect Feng's navy had intercepted the water bandits. With the matter settled, he executed Qin Bao and disposed of the remaining Haisha Gang and Vajra Temple members in Lake Tai. Zhitong, left alive to suffer, was sent back as a warning.

Afterward, Zhou Qing had the Fierce Tiger Daoist's corpse delivered to the Jiangzhou garrison commander—a "merit" to bind him to Zhou Qing's cause.

As a provincial graduate without official rank, Zhou Qing had no use for the credit. This was no reward but a ticket onto his ship.

Prefect Feng was already aboard.

More friends meant fewer enemies.

But without decisive violence, there would be no room for diplomacy.

Strength was Zhou Qing's foundation.

And it still wasn't enough. Not nearly enough.
