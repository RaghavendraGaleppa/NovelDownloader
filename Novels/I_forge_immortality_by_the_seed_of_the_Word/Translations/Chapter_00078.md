**Chapter 77: The Flood Dragon's Void-Seizing True Method**  

As soon as the words left his mouth, Ji Bochang froze in place before turning to Zhang Jing with an incredulous look.  

"Brother Zhang, did I hear you correctly? You're sure it's a top-grade inheritance?"  

Having spent nearly a month in the Inheritance Pavilion, Ji Bochang was all too familiar with the exchange prices for inheritances of different grades.  

That was precisely why Zhang Jing's words had left him stunned.  

Nine thousand Dao Merits! That was an astronomical figure!  

Even the elite Five-Colors Squad had only one or two members who could barely afford it—his senior sister not among them.  

And Zhang Jing had only been in the Dao Academy for a few months! Even if he had joined the top-ranked Luodu Squad...  

Admittedly, Ji Bochang had faith in Zhang Jing. He believed that even a top-grade inheritance would eventually be within his reach—but certainly not now.  

Yet the next moment—  

"That's right, a top-grade inheritance," Zhang Jing confirmed, sending Ji Bochang's heart into a tempest of shock.  

A real top-grade inheritance!  

His eyes clouded with bewilderment.  

What in the world had Zhang Jing been doing over the past month to amass so many Dao Merits?  

As for the possibility of the squad gifting him the merits—  

The thought had barely surfaced before Ji Bochang dismissed it outright.  

The Dao Academy had strict rules against such practices, especially for the top ten squads. Rumor had it that the Inspection Pavilion was keeping a particularly close eye on them.  

Small amounts of Dao Merits and resources might be manageable, but for the Luodu Squad to simply hand Zhang Jing nine thousand Dao Merits? That was pure fantasy.  

In other words, the vast majority of Zhang Jing's Dao Merits had to have been earned by himself.  

But to Ji Bochang, this seemed even more unbelievable than the squad gifting them to him.  

No matter how hard he racked his brain, he couldn't fathom how his friend had managed to conjure up nine thousand Dao Merits.  

Time passed slowly.  

Snapping out of his daze, Ji Bochang gave Zhang Jing an awkward smile.  

"Ah, Brother Zhang, please wait a moment. A top-grade inheritance is a significant matter. I'll go fetch the senior brother in charge."  

With that, he hurried into the depths of the Inheritance Pavilion.

**In the Inheritance Vault**  

Before the familiar bronze door, a man in purple robes, wearing a feathered crown and bearing a crimson cloud sigil on his forehead, studied Zhang Jing once more.  

"Junior Brother, are you certain you wish to spend nine thousand Dao Merits on a top-grade inheritance? Think carefully—this is no trivial matter. Once exchanged, there's no turning back."  

Zhang Jing nodded firmly.  

"Senior Brother, I am certain."  

"Why insist on this?"  

The man sighed, as if speaking more to himself than to Zhang Jing.  

"You're so young, already at the fifth level of Qi Refinement, and cultivating a mid-grade cultivation method. If you used those nine thousand Dao Merits to purchase cultivation resources, you could very likely reach the tenth level of Qi Refinement before thirty and pass the trials to enter the Inner Academy."  

"Once in the Inner Academy, obtaining a top-grade inheritance would be effortless."  

"Why gamble your hard-earned Dao Merits now?"  

"Top-grade cultivation methods are notoriously difficult to master. Comprehending their Dao Rhythms depends on serendipity—it cannot be forced. They may not even suit you better than a mid-grade method."  

After a long silence, seeing that Zhang Jing remained unmoved, the man said no more.  

With a wave of his sleeve, a jade inheritance key floated before Zhang Jing.  

"Junior Brother, try to choose a top-grade inheritance with high compatibility."  

"I understand. Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother."  

Grateful, Zhang Jing grasped the jade key and stepped into the Inheritance Vault.  

Outside the door, the man watched Zhang Jing's retreating figure with a trace of disappointment.  

Why chase after lofty ambitions now when steady progress could see him enter the Inner Academy before thirty?  

He had made it abundantly clear—entering the Inner Academy should be the foremost priority for outer disciples!  

Meanwhile, Ji Bochang kept glancing toward the vault, a communication talisman discreetly appearing in his hand.

**Inside the Inheritance Vault**  

Zhang Jing strode into the section housing the top-grade cultivation methods and immediately fixed his gaze on the jade pillar inscribed with **[The Flood Dragon's Void-Seizing True Method]**.  

But he didn't approach it right away.  

Instead, he walked resolutely to the first pillar at the very front and began testing each one in turn.  

**[The Great Solar Crow's Celestial Art]**—ten feet away, no resonance!  

**[The Nine-Winged Phoenix's Transcendence Method]**—ten feet away, no resonance!  

*Hmm, isn't this the method Shen Qingqing cultivates?*  

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened.  

Time passed unmarked.  

After testing every top-grade inheritance, Zhang Jing finally returned to **[The Flood Dragon's Void-Seizing True Method]**.  

This time, he carefully controlled the Dark Python Devours the Void Dao Rhythm and tested again—the result was the same as before.  

This confirmed his high compatibility with the method.  

"Perhaps the reason I was able to capture a wisp of the Dark Python Devours the Void Dao Rhythm from that senior brother on my way to the academy was because of this very affinity," Zhang Jing mused.  

Taking a deep, nervous breath, he gripped the jade key and slowly approached the pillar.  

As the distance closed, both the pillar and the key began to glow.  

In an instant, the vast knowledge contained within **[The Flood Dragon's Void-Seizing True Method]** surged into Zhang Jing's consciousness like a bursting dam.  

Concepts of the Void Sea, the unique Dark Python, and more intertwined, eventually forming a terrifying tableau of a python submerging the sea and devouring the void!  

After a long silence, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, shaking his slightly dizzy head.  

A jade slip materialized before him:  

**[The Flood Dragon's Void-Seizing True Method · Uninitiated (0/150)]**  

*Whew—*  

The top-grade cultivation method was finally his!  

After resting briefly, Zhang Jing rose and made his way out, his steps heavy with exhaustion.  

"Junior Brother, did the inheritance go smoothly?" the senior brother asked curiously.  

"Thanks to your guidance, Senior Brother, everything went well," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.  

---  

**Outside the Inheritance Pavilion**  

"Brother Zhang, I still have duties to attend to, so I won't see you off further," Ji Bochang said, escorting Zhang Jing to the door, reluctance coloring his expression.  

Perhaps because of his senior sister, he had few friends in the academy he could speak freely with—Zhang Jing might have been the only true one.  

Now, after this brief reunion, they had to part again, leaving him disheartened.  

"Brother Ji, no need to see me out," Zhang Jing said with a carefree smile.  

As they spoke, a mountain-sized white stag approached, its voice rumbling, "Master, are we returning now?"  

"Yes, let's go," Zhang Jing replied, turning to answer.  

"Brother Zhang, this is—" Ji Bochang gaped at Lu Thirty-Eight.  

"My mount, Lu Thirty-Eight," Zhang Jing introduced lightly.  

"Greetings," Lu Thirty-Eight lowered its head to Ji Bochang, its deep voice resonating.  

"H-Hello!" Ji Bochang stammered, his face paling as he stared at the massive stag head before him.  

He feared that if he responded too slowly, those jaws might snap down on his skull.  

Deer might not eat meat—but spirit deer were another matter.  

Seeing this, Zhang Jing rolled his eyes and smacked Lu Thirty-Eight's foreleg.  

"Who told you to scare people?"  

"Master, I didn't!" Lu Thirty-Eight protested, its voice tinged with grievance.  

It swore it had only meant to greet him properly—after all, this was the first time its master had referred to someone as a friend.  

"Brother Ji, don't be afraid. He might be big, but he's actually quite timid. I have matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave now. Until next time!"  

Seated atop Lu Thirty-Eight, Zhang Jing clasped his hands in farewell.  

"Brother Zhang, Lu Thirty-Eight—safe travels! Until we meet again!"  

Standing there, watching the distant figure grow smaller, Ji Bochang's expression grew complex—a mix of excitement and envy.
