Chapter 73: Shooting the Seventh Young Master, Brothers Part Ways

The sky began to brighten as a slanting ray of sunlight shone down.

Li Xian’s face was covered in a layer of frost, his eyelashes crystallized with icy dew. His limbs were stiff from the cold. Pang Long was right; even with profound internal Qi, prolonged exposure to the snow and wind was not a pleasant thing.

"Brother!"

Li Xiaofan suddenly said, "We've returned."

Beneath the halo of the rising sun, they could finally see their surroundings clearly. Not far away was a half-burnt-down mansion.

In front of the mansion, dozens of people were covered in dust and grime, looking utterly wretched.

"Brother, what do we do?" Li Xiaofan asked anxiously, grabbing Li Xian's clothes.

Li Xian frowned and patted the horse's back. It turned out this ugly horse knew the way. After riding through the night, because the road was pitch black and Li Xian couldn't see, he had simply let the ugly horse run freely. The ugly horse belonged to the Liu family; seeing that dawn was approaching, it had run back on its own.

Just as he was about to turn the horse around and flee quickly, he noticed that although there were many people in front of the mansion, they were all servants and laborers, with not a single member of the Black Water Gang in sight.

"Right, the Black Water Gang was chasing me all night; how could they have expected me to turn around and strike back!" Li Xian thought to himself, feeling a surge of joy. He caught sight of a man in splendid clothes among the crowd. Although he too looked disheveled, his noble aura was clearly different from that of the other servants.

Li Xian narrowed his eyes and pointed with his finger, asking:

"Brother, is that Zheng Caiqi?"

Li Xiaofan nodded, "It's him, no mistake."

"Good!"

Li Xian stepped on the stirrup and suddenly stood up, drawing his bow to a full moon, aiming directly at Zheng Caiqi.

The distance grew closer...

The Liu family servants heard the hoofbeats and turned to look. Zheng Caiqi heard the sound and turned his head, but the next moment, his face couldn't hide his terror.

"No..."

The word "no" had barely left his mouth when Li Xian's arrow shot forth fiercely.

It pierced his chest with deadly accuracy.

Zheng Caiqi gasped in pain and looked down at his chest, seeing the arrowhead buried in his flesh. He knew he had no chance of survival this time, and a wave of sorrow and unwillingness washed over him.

In an instant, the second arrow arrived, piercing his throat. Li Xian's eyes were cold as he nocked a third arrow and shot again...

Piercing his skull.

Three arrows in succession, each one fatal, executed cleanly and decisively.

"Go!"

Li Xian tugged the reins, turning the ugly horse around and leaving.

The turn of events was too fast. By the time Li Xian had ridden far away, Liu Yuanwai and the other servants finally reacted. They hurriedly checked Zheng Caiqi's breath and felt his pulse.

The noble young master, dressed in a mink-fur gown, had lost all dignity at the moment of his death. Blood flowed in torrents, he lost control of his bowels and bladder, and his legs twitched uncontrollably.

One final kick...

And he breathed his last, completely devoid of life. His expression remained frozen in a mix of panic, shock, unwillingness, and confusion.

Before this, although Li Xian wanted to kill Zheng Caiqi, his situation was dire, leaving him no room for thought; he only hoped to rescue his brother first. He hadn't expected that the ugly horse knowing the way had, by a twist of fate, given him this opportunity.

They galloped all the way and soon left Huangyu County.

By now, the sky was bright.

Seeing that his brother was still young, Li Xian knew that from this parting on, the rest of his life's path would have to be walked by himself. Deeply aware of the treacherous ways of the world, he felt a pang of heartache and wanted to see him off a bit further.

Suddenly, he saw a figure blocking the road ahead.

"Commander Pang," Li Xian was startled, and his heart sank.

"Li Xian, even if you are on leave, it's not appropriate to go too far from the manor," Pang Long said expressionlessly.

Li Xian had no choice but to dismount. "Xiaofan, Brother can only see you off here."

Li Xiaofan said, "Okay, Brother, I'll miss you."

"We've never been to the Prefecture City, be careful on your own," Li Xian said solemnly.

He knew well that the world was unstable. For a teenager in his early teens to leave home and travel a thousand miles to the Prefecture City, the dangers and obstacles were truly unimaginable. In this world that devours people, how could his brother's frail body protect himself?

"Brother, don't underestimate me," Li Xiaofan said cheerfully. "I've already picked flowers." (Note: This is likely a metaphor for having experienced the world or having some skill, though its exact meaning is ambiguous in this context.)

"Good, be careful on the road!"

Li Xian patted Li Xiaofan's shoulder and stuffed him with travel expenses and silver coins. Li Xiaofan smiled, fighting back tears, waved his hand, and ran off quickly.

Only when he was far away did he let out a quiet sob, but after wiping his tears, he continued on his journey earnestly. A true man does not weep.

"You as an elder brother, truly words can't describe it," Pang Long sighed.

Li Xian remained silent.

"Let's go, back to the manor," Pang Long patted Li Xian's shoulder. "Don't blame me for stopping you."

"Having learned the Madam's martial arts, you are the Madam's property."

"Consider it me judging a gentleman by a small man's heart. Everything in life has a price."

"Thinking it over, if not for the Madam's martial arts, how could you have rescued your brother?"

Li Xian gave a helpless smile. He had long known the manor's rules were strict and martial arts were precious. If guards were allowed to run around freely, the martial arts would have long since been leaked.

But the more it was like this...

The more he had to help his brother break through these many shackles.

As for himself... he firmly believed that he did not need to rely on anyone; he would surely be able to break free from the shackles and split apart his fetters with his own fists.

Heaven rewards the diligent, and success lies in human effort!

Yang Cheng had chased through the night, digging three feet into the ground and conducting a meticulous search, vowing to dig Li Xian out. However, that little thief was as cunning as a fox, and he remained unseen.

When the sky brightened, Yang Cheng had no choice but to accept reality and lead his gang members back.

He thought to himself:

"The Young Master's beloved horse is lost, and now that little thief has vanished without a trace. With his temperament, my days in the gang will certainly be difficult from now on."

When he returned to the front of the mansion and saw the dilapidated scene, Yang Cheng let out a long sigh. It was just as he had expected.

However, after taking a few more steps and catching a whiff of the faint scent of blood...

He suddenly felt his hair stand on end.

He rushed into the crowd and saw the Seventh Young Master lying in a pool of blood, his body already stiff. There were three arrow wounds on his body, gruesome and terrifying: one through the heart, one through the throat, and one through the skull.

The intensity of the killing intent, the decisiveness of the action... made Yang Cheng shiver all over.

"It's him!"

"It must be him!"

Yang Cheng remembered the three arrow wounds on his own body. It was just as cold, ruthless, decisive, and tricky...

As if shooting a wild deer.

Yang Cheng's face lost all color, his whole body trembled, his eyes filled with fear. The Seventh Young Master had died in his hands. If this news were to spread back to the Black Water Gang...

His fate would be too terrible to imagine!

"I... I was so focused on catching the thief that I neglected my duty to protect my master. In the end... in the end... I'm going to lose my life?"

"Rather than returning to the gang, I might as well flee now. Perhaps there's still a sliver of hope for survival!"

"Yes... that's it. In that case, I must cover up the news of the Seventh Young Master's death. Buy myself some time to escape!"

Yang Cheng, who had risen from poverty, had climbed to his current position step by step; his wit surpassed that of many others.

On the way back to the manor, Li Xian recalled the events of the night.

The life-and-death struggle with Yang Cheng had been extremely dangerous. If there had been the slightest mistake, he would have been captured immediately.

"If my brother hadn't been by my side, I would have wanted to test my skills against him again."

Li Xian's victory relied entirely on a stroke of luck, hiding his bow and iron knife in the tree.

But even without these, with his perfected Four Directions Fist, proficient Green Silk Palm, and perfected Breeze Leg, he could have put up a good fight.

It would have been good for gaining some martial world experience.

"Commander Pang, is the Black Water Gang very powerful?" Li Xian asked.

"Hmm..." Pang Long pondered for a moment. "They are quite powerful. Their gang leader, Zheng Xuezhang, is no simple character."

The two continued to talk about the Black Water Gang.
