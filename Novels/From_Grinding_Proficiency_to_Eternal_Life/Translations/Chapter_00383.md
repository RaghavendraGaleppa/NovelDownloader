# Chapter 383: The Distinctive Features of the Demon Sect

Turning to the second Xumi Pouch, Xu Yunfan’s consciousness sank into it, causing him to raise an eyebrow slightly.

Inside, there was actually a pile of Blood Crystals half a person high—a rough count revealed over two hundred pieces. Scattered nearby were several black jade slips containing fragments of the *Great Art of Swallowing the Hundred Desires and Primordial Essence*.

This was undoubtedly the wealthiest of the storage bags he had taken from the others.

The bags carried by the other Primordial Origin Sect disciples contained pitifully little. It was no wonder Chen Jiuchuan said many had entered on loans, all in hopes of securing a future.

Xu Yunfan plucked a few talismans from the third Xumi Pouch, their surfaces shimmering with golden-red light, and waved them before Chen Jiuchuan’s eyes. "Tell me, what are these?"

Chen Jiuchuan looked carefully and replied with a fawning smile, "Replying to the Senior, these are the *Golden Light Evil-Breaking Talisman* and the *Scorching Sun Evil-Burning Talisman*. They specifically target Yin Evil and malevolent spirits."

"Interesting."

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. "Aren't you from the Primordial Origin Sect, also known as the Primordial Demon Sect? Why do you carry things used by orthodox righteous sects to break evil and burn spirits? Do you perhaps also hunt demons to protect the Dao?"

Chen Jiuchuan forced an awkward smile onto his face, not daring to lie.

"The Senior is mistaken. Our sect's *Mysterious Yin True Scripture* states: 'Extreme Yin conceals Yang, and extreme Evil gives birth to Righteousness.'"

He pointed to the hidden purple patterns on the talismans. "If you look closely at the talisman core, you'll see it is actually refined using the essence blood of vengeful spirits as ink, tempered by Nine Nether Earth Fire. The so-called 'breaking evil' is actually a method to refine the opponent's evil energy for one's own use. The so-called 'burning evil' simply uses the opponent's true qi as fuel."

Seeing Xu Yunfan remain silent, he grew bolder. "Just as where venomous snakes appear, there is always an antidote grass, our sect has studied the Evil Path for three thousand years, so we naturally understand best how to break the methods of the righteous sects. These talismans..."

He lowered his voice. "They were prepared specifically to hunt those self-proclaimed righteous cultivators."

Speaking of this, Chen Jiuchuan felt a trace of pride.

"It is like using stones from other mountains to polish jade. Since we live such bitter lives, we must find our own ways to survive. Even cannon fodder has a way of living."

"...Your Primordial Origin Sect has certainly brought the concept of 'knowing yourself and knowing your enemy' to a new level."

Chen Jiuchuan hurriedly added upon seeing this, "The Senior sees clearly! Just as a poison doctor can use arsenic to save lives, our sect's talisman techniques may seem bright and upright, but in reality..."

His voice cut off abruptly as he saw Xu Yunfan had already put the talismans back into the Xumi Pouch. His expression seemed to hold a hint of curiosity, showing no anger at the methods of making the talismans he had just described.

Before he could finish speaking, Xu Yunfan had already put the bag of talismans into his sleeve, leaving only a meaningful cold snort vibrating in the air.

However, inside a Xumi storage bag, in the lining of an old book, he found a scroll of silk paper. It recorded astrological calculations for a dragon vein node in the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, presumably intended to be exchanged for sect contributions.

When inspecting Chen Jiuchuan's Xumi Pouch, Xu Yunfan's movements paused slightly. The bag contained neither pills nor talismans, nor Blood Crystals or jade slips. There was only a palm-sized, mountain-shaped token. The front was engraved with the words "Suppress the Demon," while the back was covered in dense, unreadable talisman cloud patterns.

Xu Yunfan wasn't surprised by this. He simply rubbed the token and asked casually, "Where is the Martial Dao Profound Crystal?"

Chen Jiuchuan’s pupils constricted violently before quickly returning to normal. He put on a look of confusion. "What Profound Crystal is the Senior speaking of? This junior truly doesn't understand..."

Before he could finish, Xu Yunfan lifted his eyes.

In that instant, Chen Jiuchuan seemed to see molten gold flowing within the depths of the other's eyes.

"When my Ten Extreme Martial Dao reaches perfection, the ten zhang radius around me is my domain."

Xu Yunfan's voice was extremely flat, without a single ripple of emotion.

"Your eyes are trembling like the wings of a bee right now. The third muscle on your left rib is spasming like a snake. The blood flowing in your vessels is churning like boiling water."

Chen Jiuchuan’s cold sweat soaked his back. He realized instantly that since he hadn't reached Foundation Establishment and his physique wasn't perfect, there were times he simply couldn't control his body.

He still forced a smile. "The Senior sees clearly, this disciple truly..."

"The disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect truly have good bones."

Xu Yunfan raised his hand. Under Chen Jiuchuan's terrified gaze, he grabbed his face. The strands of Ten Extreme True Qi bursting from his fingertips drilled into Chen Jiuchuan’s seven orifices like venomous snakes.

In an instant, Chen Jiuchuan felt as if millions of red-hot steel needles were piercing his meridians.

Three breaths later, when the Ten Extreme True Qi in Chen Jiuchuan’s body had been completely dissipated, he collapsed on the ground like a pile of rotten mud.

His left eye had burst, and the nails on his right hand were all turned up, yet he strangely couldn't let out a scream.

"Remember now?"

Xu Yunfan crouched down, lifting Chen Jiuchuan’s chin with his fingertip. "Or do you want to try something else? As for attacking your soul, I am somewhat lacking in ability, but regarding this body of yours, where it hurts, where it itches, and which spots can cause extreme agony, a Martial Dao cultivator knows like the back of their hand."

Chen Jiuchuan’s remaining right eye suddenly widened as he looked at Xu Yunfan leaning forward slightly.

"In... in this small world secret realm!"

Chen Jiuchuan’s face twisted, and he roared hoarsely, "When the True Martial Perfected One subdued the Flood Dragon back then, he used the qi mechanism of the entire True Martial World as a guide to forcibly infuse it, harvesting the luck of heaven and earth. In the end, he refined the legendary Martial Dao Profound Crystal, using it to hold up the path to Foundation Establishment..."

Seeing Xu Yunfan’s movements suddenly freeze, Chen Jiuchuan, feeling a slight relief in his heart, gasped for breath and continued, "I... I once obtained a notebook left behind by the True Martial Perfected One. It recorded that the Martial Dao Profound Crystal should exist in the form of a body-transformed Flood Dragon."

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes. So that was it. That explained why these Primordial Origin Sect disciples were willing to enter the True Martial World on loans; they had likely all obtained the lost tokens of that True Martial Perfected One.

He recalled the Flood Dragon covered in gruesome wounds and blood in the center of the small world secret realm back then.

The dying behemoth was bound by heavy chains, its dragon blood like streams dyeing the core of the entire secret realm...

"You've reminded me..."

Xu Yunfan picked up the dying Chen Jiuchuan, his gaze scrutinizing him like a knife.

He calculated in his heart whether he needed to kill this guy. Otherwise, with this guy's flexible and adaptable personality, he would definitely become a great enemy in the future, not to mention right now.

Watching the killing intent gradually rise in Xu Yunfan’s eyes, Chen Jiuchuan trembled all over, cold sweat pouring down, and squeezed out a hoarse plea for mercy from his throat.

"S-Senior... I am still useful! If you go to the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, you will inevitably need someone to cover for you... I... I can..."

"And why should I trust you?"

Xu Yunfan’s tone was indifferent, his fingertips tightening slightly, and the bones in Chen Jiuchuan’s neck made a cracking sound as if they couldn't bear the load.

Chen Jiuchuan knew that if he didn't offer a pledge of loyalty, he would surely die today.

He gritted his teeth and made a ruthless decision. He formed a hand seal, and a crack suddenly split open in the center of his eyebrows. A wisp of smoke-like true spirit was forcibly pulled out and slowly drifted into the mountain-shaped token in Xu Yunfan’s hand.

"Senior... my life is now in your hands..."

Chen Jiuchuan’s face was deathly pale, his smile uglier than a cry. "As long as the token shatters, no matter how far apart we are, I will... die."
