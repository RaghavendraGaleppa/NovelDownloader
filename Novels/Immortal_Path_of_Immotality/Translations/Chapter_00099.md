# Chapter 99: The Frost Tortoise Manifestation  

"Do you like this gift, esteemed host?"  

Three Golden Core cultivators hovered arrogantly in the sky, their auras unrestrained. At the center stood a middle-aged man clad in crimson robes, flanked by a veiled woman in black and an elderly man in dark attire.  

Trembling, the aged Tortoise Sage stared at the three severed heads at his feet. His gnarled hands gently brushed against them as he muttered names in disbelief: "Feng'er... Xuan'er... Ming'er..."  

The guests below recognized them instantly—these were the Tortoise Sage's most cherished disciples, the very ones expected to inherit his legacy. Yet now, their lifeless heads had been callously presented as a "gift" during his birthday celebration.  

The three demonic sects had arrived together, delivering a blatant slap to the face by slaughtering the Sage's prized students. No matter how powerful these sects were, such an insult on one's birthday was unforgivable.  

Tears streamed down the Tortoise Sage's wrinkled face as he cradled the heads in anguish. At over four hundred years old, he had already defied the natural lifespan through his unique cultivation and rare longevity elixirs. Now, he was forced to mourn disciples he had poured decades of effort into nurturing. That he hadn't erupted in fury spoke volumes of his self-restraint.  

"Honored members of the demonic path," he rasped, his voice trembling with grief. "Why... why have you done this?"  

"I have lived in seclusion, never provoking you. What grudge do you hold against me?"  

As he spoke, his aura surged. A crushing spiritual pressure blanketed the plaza, and the image of a towering, ancient tortoise materialized behind him. The mountain peak was instantly saturated with dense water-attribute spiritual energy, the air thick with moisture.  

"Manifestation of the Dharma Form—the Frost Tortoise of the Abyssal Waters!" someone gasped. "Has he reached the Nascent Soul stage?"  

"Impossible!"  

"No, he's still at the peak of Golden Core, just one step away!"  

The Golden Core cultivators in attendance paled, hastily retreating from the Sage. His oppressive aura was overwhelming, prickling their skin like needles.  

Yet the three demonic sect leaders remained unfazed. The crimson-robed man at the center chuckled darkly, his voice laced with malice as a nauseating stench of blood spread through the air, countering the Sage's pressure.  

"Old Tortoise, this isn't personal. Blame your rotten luck."  

---  

"Our three demonic sects have been preparing for this day for a long time," the man continued. "Your Turtlehook Island is merely a minor battlefield."  

"The entire East Sea—no, the entire Great Song Dynasty—is about to witness the unfolding of our grand scheme."  

"In this era of upheaval, you are but a tiny ripple in the tide."  

The crowd exchanged bewildered glances, struggling to grasp the implications. But one thing was clear—they had unwittingly stumbled into a catastrophe.  

Some clan leaders and sect elders suddenly received urgent messages from their factions.  

"Disaster! Our clan's stronghold is under attack by demonic cultivators!"  

"Our sect is besieged by the Blood River Hall!"  

"My island has been slaughtered!"  

Panic spread like wildfire. Many guests began edging toward the exits, desperate to escape. The demonic sects had launched a coordinated assault across the entire East Sea. Getting entangled in this would mean certain death.  

Lin Shan and Lin Fan exchanged uneasy glances before turning to Lei Yuzi, their strongest companion.  

"Don't look at me," she muttered. "I'm just as lost. The demonic sects were driven out of the Great Song a millennium ago, exiled to the far north beyond even the Great Yan. Now they return, bold enough to swallow the entire East Sea? This is no small gambit. We must retreat and warn our sect elders."  

With that, she tugged at the two, blending into the crowd as they inched toward the periphery.  

They weren't alone. Many shared the same thought, yet none dared to be the first to flee. After all, if the demonic sects had planned this meticulously, they wouldn't have sent only three Golden Core experts.  

Meanwhile, the Tortoise Sage had pieced together the situation. His expression remained stoic as his aura and Dharma Form continued to swell.  

"I care not for your schemes," he growled. "But slaughtering my disciples is an offense I cannot overlook. Do you truly believe the three of you are enough to face me?"  

His frail demeanor vanished, replaced by an intimidating dominance. The spectral tortoise behind him roared skyward.  

Yet before the demonic leaders could respond, a melodious laugh rang out from the crowd.  

"Of course not just three," a voice chimed. "The Southern Sea's Rainmist Pavilion has also come to assist."  

A breathtakingly beautiful woman stepped forward, her long hair flowing as five-colored ribbons of light swirled around her. This was the Rainmist Pavilion's guardian, Fairy Xiao.  

"Fairy Xiao!" the Tortoise Sage exclaimed. "So that's why you came uninvited. I wondered why I merited such an honor."  

But more voices followed.  

"Count the Eastern Sandland's Lu Clan in."  

"The Linhai Ju Family has no choice but to comply."  

"Zhang Qian of Mount Xiaoheng apologizes, old friend."  

"I, too, act under coercion."  

In moments, half of the dozen Golden Core cultivators present had defected.  

The Tortoise Sage's eyes widened in shock, especially at the sight of longtime allies betraying him. The traitors averted their gazes, unable to meet his.  

The betrayal didn't stop there. Among the Foundation Establishment guests, even more revealed their allegiance.  

"I, the Bandit King Xiong Shan, pledge loyalty to the demonic sects!"  

"The Liu Clan of the East Sea has long sworn fealty to the Hundred Ghosts Sect!"  

"The Yuyan Market obeys only the Black Lotus Sect!"  

"The Little Shark Sect serves the Blood River Hall!"  

The remaining guests—including Lin Shan's group—realized with horror that they were surrounded. Three of the nearest tables had all been infiltrated by traitors, who now gleefully greeted each other.  

With over half the attendees defecting, the truly uninvolved began to panic.  

*Should we run? Or run faster? Or just run right now?*  

Facing the combined might of the demonic sects, resistance was suicide.  

The Blood River Hall's guardian spared them no time to deliberate. With a sweeping gesture, he commanded:  

"Kill all bystanders!"  

The mountaintop erupted into chaos as a thousand cultivators scattered like startled birds.  

Seizing the moment, Lei Yuzi grabbed Lin Shan and Lin Fan, vanishing into the fleeing crowd.
