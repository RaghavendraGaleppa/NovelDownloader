# Chapter 36: Skeleton Mountain Market

Lü Yang quickly became acquainted with Zhao Xuhe, leveraging his understanding of Zhao Xuhe from previous lives. This also gave Zhao Xuhe a long-lost feeling of respect from an outsider.

To be honest, he hadn't felt this way in many years.

Ever since the price of the Yin Puppet for the Dead plummeted, Dragon Disc Island mysteriously disappeared, and even his master, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord, couldn't divine the cause, his life had become increasingly difficult.

First, his master grew more and more disappointed in him. Second, his cultivation struggled to advance, remaining stuck at the mid-stage Qi Condensation for a full decade, unable to break through the bottleneck. If there was any good news, it was that his master, seeing his steady decline, canceled his engagement with his junior sister.

The world was unpredictable, and human relationships were fickle; Zhao Xuhe had experienced it all in these ten years.

Therefore, upon hearing that Lü Yang had exited the market just as the price of the Yin Puppet for the Dead was at its peak, thus achieving financial freedom, Zhao Xuhe's eyes turned red with envy.

"Alas, Junior Brother, your Dao heart is firm, uncorrupted by wealth. Your future achievements are limitless. It's just a pity I didn't have such a Dao heart back then..."

"Senior Brother, you mustn't belittle yourself."

Lü Yang whispered comfortingly, "Fortune isn't judged by a single day or moment. As long as Senior Brother is committed to the path of immortality, what are brief setbacks?"

"You're right."

Zhao Xuhe nodded, seeming to perk up slightly. Then he tentatively glanced at Lü Yang, opened his mouth, but said nothing.

Such behavior, in Lü Yang's eyes, clearly revealed his intentions.

He wanted to borrow money.

Lü Yang smiled faintly. If Zhao Xuhe didn't mention it, he naturally wouldn't bring it up himself. After all, if something was obtained too easily, one wouldn't cherish it.

Just then, a voice suddenly came from the flying boat:
"Skeleton Mountain, arrived!"

Northern Frontier, Skeleton Mountain.

Named a mountain, it was actually a vast mountain range stretching for hundreds of miles, with peaks clustered like gathering clouds and waves raging like a storm. Every inch of land brimmed with spiritual energy.

There was a good reason why the Sacred Sect established a market here. While it was far from comparable to the Heaven-Connecting Cloud Sea, for ordinary rogue cultivators, Skeleton Mountain could be considered a treasure land. At the very center of the mountain range lay a White Bone Cave, where the Sacred Sect's market was located.

"This place's geomancy is an extremely Yin location."

On the flying boat's deck, Lü Yang overlooked the Skeleton Mountain's脉, somewhat surprised: "Any cultivator buried here would inevitably transform into a zombie within ten years..."

"Junior Brother has keen insight."

A shimmer of light appeared, and Fairy Feixia, her feathered cloak fluttering, walked out gracefully: "That's why the Sacred Sect sent us here to guard Skeleton Mountain and maintain order in the market."

"As Junior Brother said, due to its unique geomancy, Skeleton Mountain experiences a large-scale zombie tide every thirty years. These zombies are mindless, only knowing to devour living beings. This is both a risk and an opportunity for Skeleton Mountain, as these zombies are excellent materials for refining artifacts."

After explaining, Fairy Feixia continued:

"The market is protected by the 'Bone-Returning Great Array'. Daoist Lu and Daoist Chen are responsible for two of the four array cores. Junior Brother and I will each take one of the remaining two?"

"As Senior Sister commands."

Fairy Feixia nodded upon hearing this. Immediately, her embroidered brows slightly furrowed, and she glanced at Zhao Xuhe, who stood beside Lü Yang, eyes wide with disbelief.

"What is it?" Lü Yang asked curiously, "Does Senior Sister know Senior Brother Zhao?"

"...No."

Fairy Feixia indifferently withdrew her gaze from Zhao Xuhe, turning to Lü Yang with a gentle smile: "I'll be relying on Junior Brother's care in the future."

With that, she activated a beam of light and flew away.

Zhao Xuhe remained rooted to the spot, his expression complex, clearly having guessed that Lü Yang, being able to oversee the market, definitely wasn't at the mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivation level he had sensed.

"Senior Brother Zhao?"

Lü Yang's voice reached him, and Zhao Xuhe's movements stiffened.

A mix of joy and desolation appeared on his face. His lips moved, but no sound came out. His demeanor finally became respectful, and he distinctly called out:

"My Lord."

Seeing this, Lü Yang could only sigh helplessly: "Senior Brother Zhao, I have official duties to attend to. If you encounter any difficulties in the future, feel free to contact me."

With that, he too soared away.

Only Zhao Xuhe remained, his expression fluctuating between clear and overcast. His previous multitude of emotions quickly receded, replaced by a look of contemplation in his eyes.

"He's wary of me. It seems I was too hasty."

Entering the market, Lü Yang recalled Zhao Xuhe's recent reaction and couldn't help but chuckle: "As I expected, he actually has another purpose for coming to this market."

"Good, good!"

"In this life, I must make him a true confidant!"

Lü Yang wasn't afraid of Zhao Xuhe being wary, because he had ample patience.

If necessary, he could even abandon this life and truly become lifelong friends with Zhao Xuhe, gathering intelligence to pave the way for his next life!

While contemplating, Lü Yang had already arrived before a pavilion.

This place was one of the four array cores of the market, and also the area with the most spiritual energy in Skeleton Mountain, estimated to be about thirty percent of the Sacred Sect's cave mansion level.

"Blood-Washing Heavenly River Sword Array, activate!"

Lü Yang waved his large sleeve, and the Blood Sun Sword Orb flew into the pavilion, taking its place as the core. Immediately, array patterns expanded, beginning to replace the existing ones.

Although the 'Bone-Returning Great Array' of the market was more profound than the Blood-Washing Heavenly River Sword Array, firstly, Lü Yang only occupied one of its array cores, and secondly, as an array master, Lü Yang disliked entrusting his life and fate to an array set up by an outsider.

"After all, I have quite a few secrets..."

"And the Skeleton Mountain Market has been established for so long, even if this 'Bone-Returning Great Array' is sophisticated, its effects are already widely known."

The more one's true capabilities were exposed, the easier it was to be targeted.

So if any truly powerful figures were to attack Skeleton Mountain Market, they would undoubtedly have prepared means to break the 'Bone-Returning Great Array'.

Therefore, at that time, this Bone-Returning Great Array might not be of much use.

That being said, Lü Yang didn't directly abandon the array. Instead, he opened a new area within the pavilion, creating an array within an array, which could serve as a trump card.

After completing all this, Lü Yang nodded in satisfaction.

Following this, he waved his hand again, naming the pavilion 'Blood-Clothed Pavilion', formally establishing his residence in Skeleton Mountain Market and giving himself an external designation.

Just then, over a dozen streaks of light flew over.

These were Sacred Sect disciples assigned to Lü Yang's area, mostly at the early and mid-stages of Qi Condensation, who had also come to the market for missions.

The streaks of light flew into the Blood-Clothed Pavilion and dispersed one after another, revealing cultivators of various ages and genders, all with respectful expressions, approaching the balcony. There, leaning against the railing, stood a handsome, blood-robed young man, smiling faintly as he looked down at all of them.

"Greetings, Pavilion Master!"

The disciples dared not delay, bowing in unison. Although within the Sacred Sect they could address each other as senior or junior brothers/sisters, outside the sect, official titles were used.

Moreover, this was a senior brother at the late-stage Qi Condensation!

Early-stage, mid-stage, late-stage, and Great Perfection of the Qi Condensation realm might seem like just four minor realms, but the gap between them could truly be called a chasm.

"Dispense with the formalities."

Looking at the line of figures below, Lü Yang nodded in satisfaction, thinking to himself: "Not bad, at a glance they're all just common folk, no capable individuals."

The Sacred Sect, setting aside other things, truly offered a top-tier cultivation environment. So generally, cultivators who chose external assignments were either like Lü Yang and Fairy Feixia, aiming for Foundation Establishment, or like these people before him: poor in aptitude, old in age, and lacking resources, unable to make a living within the Sacred Sect.

"If I wanted to, I could kill them all with one sword..."

Those intending to build a force might be dissatisfied with this situation, but Lü Yang felt it was just right. The atmosphere of weakness made him feel very at ease...

"You may all disperse. Handle minor matters yourselves; no need to come find me."

Lü Yang casually gave his orders and then immediately dismissed them, subsequently sealing off the Blood-Clothed Pavilion, intending to cultivate peacefully and remain in seclusion until the opportunity for Foundation Establishment arose!
