# Chapter 176: Lin

The moment the woman in white’s wide sleeves fell, he saw the shimmering waves of the Li River solidify into sword intent beneath them, crashing down upon him like a collapsing sky.

It was Intent!

Sword Intent!

“Hold!”

Xu Yunfan roared, but before his voice could fade, the frost patterns drawn by the woman’s fingers had already frozen the air.

The hair on Xu Yunfan’s neck stood on end. Years of battlefield slaughter had honed his muscle memory, instinctively forcing him to lean back.

Three veins bulged on his bronze neck. The signs of Golden Skin and Jade Veins appeared instantly; the ridges of his solid ribs and coiled muscles bulged. His broad pectoral muscles stretched his clothes to the breaking point, yet he still could not outrun the cold light that seemed capable of piercing through mountains.

*Swish!*

The sound of the sword arriving lagged half a beat behind.

Xu Yunfan maintained the posture of an iron board bridge, suddenly realizing he could see the inverted Li River.

The blood-red setting sun spun in his vision. The last thing he saw was his headless body collapsing to its knees. The blood column spraying from his severed neck actually froze into an ice spike in mid-air.

“What kind of joke is this…”

His lingering consciousness had not yet dissipated when the cold sword intent rushed up his spine and into his brain marrow.

When Xu Yunfan opened his eyes for the second time, the phantom pain of having his throat frozen and shattered during the previous kill still lingered in his tiger’s mouth.

He did not hesitate. With a fierce shout, he shook the ice shards from his hair. His robust waist twisted like a drawn bow; the knotted muscles of his back tore spiderweb cracks through his cloth shirt.

The killing techniques honed on the battlefield transformed into a Black Tiger Steals the Heart. His five fingers tore through the airwaves, aiming directly for the woman’s Tanzhong acupoint.

The woman’s plain silk fluttered.

Seven ice lotuses suddenly bloomed before Xu Yunfan’s eyes; every petal was a solidified sword intent.

The moment his steel-cast knuckles struck the first lotus, the armor-like deltoid of his entire right arm suddenly burst with fine blood beads. It was the trail of sword intent entering his meridians through his pores.

“Break!”

His eyes bulged furiously. The blood energy throughout his body surged like a blast furnace. His left fist, carrying pure Yang internal energy, slammed into his own right shoulder.

The arm eroded by sword intent exploded at the root. The flesh and shattered bones, however, coagulated into red ice crystals in the air.

The intense pain only provoked his ferocity. He actually used his残躯 (broken body) as a shield to crash through the remaining six ice lotuses. His blood-stained left hand was only three inches away from the woman’s throat.

The woman finally raised her eyes.

When her two fingers, held like a sword, pointed at his heart, Xu Yunfan heard the crisp sound of his ribs freezing and shattering one by one.

Pure Yang internal energy surged wildly in his chest cavity, but the veins bulging under his bronze skin burst one after another. Xu Yunfan’s face instantly flushed red, and he let out a嘶吼 (roar).

“You damn…”

When he fell with a crash, his entire body had turned into an ice sculpture. A section of an ice sword, condensed from Li River water, was插着 (plugged) into the position of his heart.

*‘Your Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique is constantly being polished. You have understood the key to exerting the Shaking Mountain force between life and death. The proficiency of your Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique has increased.’*

*‘The pure Yang internal energy condensed by your Rising Sun One Qi Technique seems to have refined slightly with the flow of blood and flesh. The proficiency of the Rising Sun One Qi Technique has increased.’*

*‘…’*

Opening his eyes again, Xu Yunfan looked at the woman in plain clothes standing atop the mountain peak once more. Under the illumination of the setting sun, her graceful figure was vaguely visible through her clothes.

“Lin!”

Xu Yunfan’s anxious emotions, as his hands formed the Lin seal before his chest, receded like the tide. All emotions became invisible. The seal and his heart became one.

He looked up, gazing at the woman in plain clothes standing atop the mountain peak three hundred meters away, separated by the river.

“I remember, this is my dream.”

A rare ripple of change finally appeared in the woman’s calm eyes. She did not speak, just looked quietly at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan raised a single hand. A phantom of a six-barreled Gatling gun appeared in his hand, but it flickered and shattered like a bubble.

It seemed he needed to know the structure to materialize it.

In the Lin state, Xu Yunfan instantly grasped the crux of the matter. After thinking it over for a long time, he grabbed with one hand, and the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer appeared in his hand.

Without the slightest hesitation, the muscles of his right leg suddenly swelled by three inches. The moment his heel ground the blue rock to dust, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, carrying the sound of wind and thunder, smashed toward the woman’s face.

Nine rotating lava patterns instantly appeared on the hammer handle. The explosive energy rising from the hammer head flickered with arcs of electricity, dragging a ten-zhang long tongue of fire across the surface of the Li River,映着 (reflecting) the inverted Nine-Bend River flow like a purgatory blood river.

In the Lin state, the dormant potential and accumulated foundations within his body began to rise like dragons and snakes, shattering the heavens and earth inside him. The pure Yang internal energy surging through his flesh and blood flowed like magma, like firewood doused in boiling oil.

Speed and power were several times greater than before!

The woman in white’s wide sleeves fluttered gently. The starlight flowing between her plain silks suddenly condensed into an ice crystal barrier.

The moment the dragging, crashing Thousand-Jun hammer force struck the barrier, Xu Yunfan’s tiger’s mouth burst with blood flowers. The seemingly thin ice crystal actually contained nine layers of continuous force, completely rebounding his seven-tenths of strength.

At the same time, the woman raised her pale, slender fingers. Her figure flashed suddenly, landing in front of him.

*Crack!*

Amidst the sound of the skull shattering, Xu Yunfan fell backward into the river.

*‘Your Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique…’*
*‘Your Lin Seal…’*

Opening his eyes again, Xu Yunfan glanced at the proficiency increase prompts appearing in his vision. Both the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer and the Lin Seal had increased by one point of proficiency.

This was excellent!

“Lin!”

Xu Yunfan’s eyes were calm. Facing the sky full of sword intent flying toward him, he twisted his body to a degree unimaginable to ordinary people, dodging by a hair's breadth.

His clothes tore with a *poof*. His body felt a sudden clarity. Holding the hammer, he twisted his body in mid-air, exerted force, and shook the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.

The woman in white, seeing Xu Yunfan’s naked gaze, paused imperceptibly, her expression growing even deeper.

The third move of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique, Stacked Waves Shatter the Mountain.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer suddenly flew out, splitting into nine afterimages in the air.

This was the fiercest stacked force technique in the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique. It required smashing nine hammers to the same point. The rebounding force was transformed into nine layers of hidden force through the Yongquan acupoint, requiring the bones of the entire body to be dislocated by three inches to execute.

Xu Yunfan’s body erupted with cracking sounds like frying beans. The core muscle groups exerting force were stretched to the limit like steel cables, making terrifying sounds as if they were snapping one by one. The result was that nine hammer shadows sealed all the woman’s retreat paths.

Ripples finally appeared in the woman’s eyes.

Plain silk rolled up seven rusted swords from the river. The sword tips accurately struck the junction between real and false in the hammer shadows.

Amidst the sound of metal clashing, Xu Yunfan, however, shot out along the ground like a ghost. His calloused left hand grabbed for the woman’s ankle. The killing move just now was actually a feint!

*Rip!*

The sound of tearing silk startled the river surface.

Xu Yunfan’s fingers clutched half a piece of plain silk, grabbing the woman’s snow-white ankle.

It was very delicate, with a texture like jade.

Provoked by this, the woman’s cold gaze seemed to become even sharper.

The Li River suddenly rolled backward into the sky. Countless sword souls surged from the bottom of the river, forming a giant sword wheel behind the woman.

The next instant, Xu Yunfan’s vision went dark.

When he was reborn for the seventh time, the bones of his right arm still retained the phantom pain of being ground apart by frost-patterned sword intent.

“Lin!”

Xu Yunfan formed the Lin seal with one hand, while the other hand grabbed the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer behind him.

As the Lin state was used repeatedly, it seemed to have undergone some elusive changes.
