# Chapter 231: Clear Eyes

The dragon scale armor scraped against the青鳞 (green scales), sparking a shower of fire. However, the Red Serpent Mountain-Crushing Strength had already transformed into three thousand soft threads, climbing up the thirty-six major acupoints along Qi Huan’s spine.

The elephant demon, heavily injured by a single hammer blow, finally caught a breather while Xu Yunfan was dealing with Qi Huan. Letting out a roar, its trunk, like a whip, tore through the air and struck at that very moment.

The sharp whistle of the trunk tearing through the air was right by his ear.

Xu Yunfan didn't show the slightest panic; in fact, his expression carried a hint of ease and casualness.

Since stepping into the Blood Transformation Realm, he had continued to practice diligently. Although his proficiency hadn't reached the level of a qualitative change, with the accumulation of proficiency, his Qi and blood had become increasingly abundant, far surpassing that of martial artists in the same realm.

Xu Yunfan’s right shoulder blade suddenly lifted three inches, and the muscles of his neck and shoulders bulged high. The fascia of the Hundred Tempered Steel Body trembled like bowstrings, and the scales of his dragon armor rippled, making the flow of his muscles clearly visible.

He grabbed Qi Huan and, using his demonic body as a shield, threw him toward the elephant demon.

The shockwave generated by the collision of the two thoroughly tempered bodies pulverized the gravel within a radius of fifty feet into dust.

Using the recoil, he spun and caught the returning Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.

"Moo!"

The elephant demon roared, its trunk whipping through the air, shattering three ancient cypress trees. But just as it was about to touch the hammer's edge, it bent诡异地 (strangely) and swung toward Xu Yunfan, the air seeming to boil from the impact.

The hidden dragon pulse strength Xu Yunfan had pressed into the ground with his foot arch had long since woven a spiderweb-like transmission pattern underground.

The nearly hundred-pound hammer felt as light as a lamp wick in his hand. The moment the hammer head's lightning patterns lit up, the seven layers of stacked Red Serpent Mountain-Crushing Strength erupted like a volcano.

"Crack!"

The scales on the elephant demon's trunk shattered inch by inch.

Xu Yunfan’s虎口 (tiger's mouth/hand) trembled slightly, but the next instant, it was guided into the ground by the unique force-dissipating technique of the Hundred Tempered Steel Body. The shoulder and elbow joints of the Hundred Tempered Steel Body produced twelve sounds of metal clashing, completing nine turns of strength redirection within a tiny space.

The hammer shadow in his hand turned into a red-gold wheel, rolling up against the muscle texture of the elephant demon's trunk. Wherever it passed, bones and flesh turned to mush.

The elephant demon's solitary eye turned bloodshot, and suddenly, a dark green toxic mist sprayed out from between its tusks.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate to retract his hammer. The 1,720 red serpent scales of his dragon armor all flared outward, and the surging scorching heat turned the toxic mist into green smoke.

Having already leaped into the air, Xu Yunfan’s left leg suddenly and unpredictably lifted high. The scales on his heel stood up viciously, like a heavy hammer smashing toward the elephant demon's skull. This move seemed fierce, but it actually concealed thirty-six soft strengths. When it landed, it would transmit explosive force deep within the flesh and blood.

The sound of the skull cracking and the ground splitting rang out simultaneously.

The elephant demon collapsed with a thud, twitching on the ground.

Xu Yunfan used the rebound force to leap three zhang into the air again. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swung a full half-moon above his head, and the hammer edge slammed heavily against the sharp claws Qi Huan was thrusting over.

"Interesting."

Thoughts flashed through Xu Yunfan's mind.

How does a human transform into a demon?

The hammer's momentum suddenly shifted from hard to soft.

Watching Qi Huan's arm explode, Xu Yunfan's spine rose and fell like a great dragon. The Red Serpent Mountain-Crushing Strength turned into three thousand stacked waves that penetrated Qi Huan's body.

Qi Huan's chest, covered in green scales, suddenly sank three inches.

Xu Yunfan's right hand formed a finger spear, precisely striking the Tian Tu acupoint at the intersection of Qi Huan's collarbones.

This finger strike seemed light, but it actually condensed seven layers of penetrating soft strength. Even Zhan Yan, who had cultivated the Hundred Tempered Steel Body to a high level, would have to close his Qi and blood for three hours and completely pass out.

The blood light in Qi Huan's beast eyes suddenly went out, and his body went limp, about to fall to the ground.

Before he could hit the ground, Xu Yunfan grabbed the back of his neck with one hand and dragged him to a mountain hollow by the river, adjacent to a spiritual energy node, and turned into a miner again.

In less than half an hour, a decent-sized cave had appeared before him.

When the twilight colored the cliffs, Xu Yunfan had already finished processing the elephant demon's corpse.

He stood holding the hammer beside Qi Huan, roasting several large chunks of demon meat while carefully observing the changes in Qi Huan's body.

The scales on his body were real, and the broken horn on his forehead was also as expected.

After setting up the meat and applying several handfuls of seasonings identified through his hunting skills, Xu Yunfan stood up and clapped his hands, walking over to Qi Huan.

He reached out and pried open Qi Huan's mouth. Seeing the crisscrossing fangs inside, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but grimace.

He had no idea what Qi Huan had encountered in the秘境 (mysterious realm/secret realm) to end up in such a ghostly, non-human state.

Suddenly, a dark green ripple appeared on Qi Huan's neck.

Before Xu Yunfan's fingertip could leave, he felt the body under his palm erupt with a tremor like a bursting mountain flood. The demonic green scales stood up like living things. Qi Huan's suddenly opened eyes had turned into two blood moons, with three layers of serrated demonic patterns rotating deep within the pupils.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and stepped back half a step. The fascia of his foot arch, like a dragon spine bowstring, tightened, and the rock beneath his feet cracked, sinking half a foot.

Bang!

A loud, violent sound, and Qi Huan passed out again.

After a few quarters of an hour, Qi Huan's body trembled, and he opened his blood-red beast eyes again. Before he could see what was in front of him clearly, a large, jade-like hand covered his face.

Bang!

Qi Huan's head tilted to the side, passing out once more.

Xu Yunfan, who was chewing on a skewer he had just pulled from the fire, retracted his hand and turned around to add more seasoning to the meat.

It was spicy enough, but the salt was a bit lacking.

Although he had found salt stones and crushed them into powder, he hadn't had time to filter them. The salt had a bitter taste, so he could only cover it with the fragrant spices he found nearby.

Another half hour passed. Qi Huan's body shivered, and he opened his eyes again.

Dong!

Qi Huan's blood-red eyes seemed to see stars as he passed out again.

Until the eighth time, when a hand holding a piece of roasted meat and another fist, surging with Red Serpent Mountain-Crushing Strength and glowing with faint red light, was about to fall...

Qi Huan, who now had a pair of clear eyes, hurriedly said, "I'm awake, I'm awake, stop hitting me, if you hit me again, something will really go wrong!"

Hearing Qi Huan speak, Xu Yunfan hesitated. Under Qi Huan's nervous gaze, he finally slowly withdrew his fist, then revealed a faint smile on his face.

"Senior Brother Qi, it's truly a small world. I didn't expect to meet you here. Everyone else thought you were dead."

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan looked Qi Huan up and down and said, "To be honest, in your current state, you'd be more at ease if you were dead."

Qi Huan couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh upon hearing this, but he was also extremely shocked inside. He never imagined that even in his demonized form, he couldn't take a single punch from Xu Yunfan.

What was all his effort over these days for? Was he just a clown?

Qi Huan's mind was in turmoil. The scene of Xu Yunfan killing the elephant demon with a few hammer blows was vivid in his mind. That feeling of fierce and unparalleled power—even if a Bone Marrow Refining Realm master were standing before him, he wouldn't have felt the terrifying aura of a prehistoric beast that Xu Yunfan radiated.

After a long while, Qi Huan sighed and said, "Brother Xu, this is a long story, there are too many twists and turns."

Seeing that Qi Huan didn't want to talk much about the origin of his demonization, Xu Yunfan didn't press further. It was most likely that he had come into contact with some demonic power, causing his body to mutate.

His biggest doubt was how Qi Huan, who was clearly in the Xuanzhen Secret Realm, ended up in the Divine Weapon Secret Realm. Was it as he suspected?
