# Chapter 207: Seeking Guidance  

"Come in!" Fortunately, Elder Ma was worried about keeping Li Shiming waiting too long. After leaving him outside for over an hour, he finally allowed him to enter Dan Ding Peak.  

At the summit of Dan Ding Peak stood the Dan Ding Hall. Li Shiming landed outside the hall, where a young attendant led him inside to meet Elder Ma.  

This was Li Shiming's first time entering the alchemy chamber of a Golden Core elder. The scent of medicinal herbs filled the air inside Dan Ding Hall. Having spent some time refining pills himself, he could now recognize many of the aromas. However, most of them were unfamiliar to him—unsurprising, as the hall was rarely used for first-grade pills, and the lingering scents mostly belonged to second- and third-grade medicinal herbs.  

What caught his attention the most was the alchemy furnace radiating an astonishing aura. His first thought was that it must be a magic treasure.  

Li Shiming had not only seen magic treasures before—he even possessed a Sword Cultivator's lifebound magic treasure and several special treasures. He could recognize the aura of a magic treasure, but the alchemy furnace before him emitted the strongest presence he had ever encountered.  

Noticing neither spirit carbon nor any earthfire source near the furnace, he couldn't help but feel curious.  

"Disciple Li Shiming pays his respects to Elder Ma!" Li Shiming bowed respectfully, presenting a jade box in his hands as he spoke.  

"Have you studied the alchemy inheritance I gave you?" Elder Ma lifted his gaze and asked indifferently.  

He had already prepared himself. If Li Shiming admitted he hadn't studied it yet, Elder Ma would give him a stern lecture.  

In the entire Shushan Sect, whenever he, a master alchemist, expressed interest in teaching, any disciple he pointed at would immediately prostrate themselves, begging for his guidance.  

Yet here was Li Shiming, making him wait for so many days.  

"Disciple has attempted refining some pills. Please take a look!" Unaware of Elder Ma's thoughts, Li Shiming retrieved a jade bottle and placed it atop the jade box.  

Elder Ma was intrigued. Li Shiming hadn't sought his guidance but had still managed to produce something. What kind of pills had he concocted?  

Before examining them, Elder Ma first opened the jade box.  

A faint tea fragrance wafted out, making him inhale lightly. Second-grade spirit tea was something even a Golden Core elder and master alchemist like him rarely enjoyed.  

The sect did possess third-grade spirit tea, but it was strictly managed and distributed in limited quantities to Golden Core elders each year. The amount was so meager that unless entertaining important guests, elders wouldn't bring it out.  

Though the tea in the box was second-grade, its roasting technique was exceptional, elevating its quality to the very peak of second-grade.  

"Perfect second-grade spirit tea!" Elder Ma silently assessed.  

Even if he had personally roasted it, he couldn't guarantee achieving such perfection. Moreover, he detected traces of the "Green Willow Spiritual Sense Art" and the "Golden Sun Fire Control Art" in the tea.  

Had it not been for these two unique techniques—his own secret methods—he might have suspected Li Shiming had purchased the tea elsewhere.  

Elder Ma closed the jade box. Such high-quality second-grade spirit tea would be a waste if even a trace of its spiritual energy was lost.  

His impression of Li Shiming improved significantly. Regardless, the disciple had indeed studied the alchemy inheritance he provided, mastering at least these two secret techniques with remarkable proficiency.  

Furthermore, Elder Ma gained deeper insight into Li Shiming's alchemy potential. Previously, he had taken an interest in Li Shiming for another reason.  

Next, Elder Ma opened the jade bottle and poured out a pill.  

"Hmm? This is a high-grade 'Mind-Clearing Nine Palaces Pill'!" Elder Ma didn't possess the recipe for this pill, but he could identify any pill he had seen before at a glance.  

His spiritual sense swept over the pill, detecting traces of residual heat, confirming it had been refined recently.  

"Did you refine this?" Elder Ma looked at Li Shiming, somewhat uncertain.  

The quality of the "Mind-Clearing Nine Palaces Pill" was simply too high. High-grade was the pinnacle for a single batch of pills—top-grade results were rare anomalies in the alchemy process.  

"Yes, disciple has been diligently studying alchemy recently and can now refine first-grade pills," Li Shiming replied truthfully with a bow.  

Elder Ma glanced at the pill in his hand, then back at Li Shiming, sensing something amiss in his words.  

If this was what Li Shiming called "can now refine first-grade pills," then what did that make his other alchemy disciples?  

"Did you use spirit fire?" Elder Ma stared at Li Shiming and asked.  

Li Shiming looked back in confusion. If spirit fire referred to spirit carbon, then yes, he had used it. But Elder Ma's expression suggested he wasn't talking about spirit carbon.  

Besides, as a novice alchemist, what else could he use besides spirit carbon?  

Seeing Li Shiming's puzzled expression, Elder Ma realized the disciple likely didn't even know what spirit fire was.  

"Alchemists are divided into two types: those who possess spirit fire and those who don't," Elder Ma explained solemnly.  

Li Shiming grew even more perplexed. He knew alchemists were classified by rank—beginner, intermediate, advanced, and master—but he had never heard of Elder Ma's categorization.  

"Elder Ma, what is spirit fire?" he couldn't help but ask.  

Instead of answering directly, Elder Ma extended a finger, and a small flame appeared atop it.  

At the sight of the flame, Li Shiming immediately recalled the tiny flicker of fire in his spiritual lake.  

"This is my spirit fire, the Earthflame Spirit Fire, harvested from deep underground. The first time I saw you, I sensed the aura of spirit fire on you. That's why I left you the alchemy inheritance—I hoped you could become an alchemist and not waste this rare opportunity," Elder Ma explained with a smile.  

Finally, Li Shiming understood why Elder Ma had taken a special interest in him. The tiny flame he had obtained was spirit fire!  

But he didn't know its name or purpose.  

"Elder Ma, I must seek your guidance. I obtained this spirit fire by chance in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. Do you know its name and uses?" With a thought, the small flame emerged on his fingertip as he asked.  

"Before you form your Golden Core, do not expose your spirit fire outside. Its value is beyond your imagination!" Elder Ma warned without using his spiritual sense, observing with his eyes alone.  

"Yes, Elder Ma!" Li Shiming withdrew the flame back into his spiritual lake, looking at Elder Ma expectantly for answers.  

"Did you obtain this spirit fire from a giant bear's den?" Elder Ma pondered briefly before asking.  

"Exactly so. The Solaris Tri-Leaf Grass was in that bear's den. I discovered this spirit fire while retrieving the herb for my master," Li Shiming answered truthfully without hesitation.  

If Elder Ma had ill intentions, he wouldn't have spoken so much. Snatching the spirit fire—or even Li Shiming's life—would have been effortless for him.  

Though the emotions of Golden Core cultivators were hard to discern, IBMz15's analysis of Elder Ma's facial expressions suggested no malice.  

"Just as I thought. Junior Su was right—your fortune is indeed profound. To think you dared to steal herbs guarded by a Solaris Bear alone!" Elder Ma nodded with a faint smile.  

His opinion of Li Shiming rose yet again. He knew how powerful the spirit beast guarding the Solaris Tri-Leaf Grass was. For Li Shiming to risk his life for a promise—such a cultivator was naturally likable.  

More importantly, Li Shiming also possessed immense luck.  

At the very least, Elder Su firmly believed this, attributing his own recovery from injuries after obtaining the Solaris Tri-Leaf Grass to sharing in Li Shiming's fortune.  

"Among Solaris Bears, there is a rare chance for one to be born with a companion spirit fire. Such bears are heavily protected within their clan, making it nearly impossible for cultivators to encounter them.  

"The Solaris Bear clan is incredibly powerful, with their strongest members reaching late-stage third-grade demonic beasts—sometimes even fourth-grade.  

"A Solaris Bear with a companion spirit fire will only leave the clan under one circumstance: during the final stage of advancing to a great demonic beast. At that time, it will guard a yang-attributed spiritual object while preparing for its breakthrough.  

"During this period, the bear will expel its spirit fire, allowing it to absorb external flames to enhance its yang energy. Only after consuming a third-grade yang-attributed herb, at the final moment before forming its demonic core, will it reclaim the spirit fire, merging it permanently with the core—making it impossible to seize afterward," Elder Ma explained.  

He couldn't help but envy Li Shiming's luck. Spirit fires varied in type and grade.  

Though his Earthflame Spirit Fire was a third-grade spirit fire—already considered high-tier—the Solaris Spirit Fire was a growth-type spirit fire, capable of ascending in grade alongside its user's cultivation.  

This didn't mean Earthflame Spirit Fire couldn't advance, but doing so required rarer materials—specifically, fourth-grade spiritual items compatible with it. Even Nascent Soul elders couldn't guarantee obtaining such materials.  

In contrast, growth-type spirit fires only needed a steady supply of energy to improve, eliminating the need for external treasures.  

This distinction made growth-type spirit fires the most coveted.  

"Your spirit fire is called the Solaris Spirit Fire—a supreme yang-attributed flame capable of incinerating all things. Currently, it's at the early second-grade stage. If you cultivate fire-attribute spiritual energy, infuse it into the Solaris Spirit Fire daily to accelerate its growth," Elder Ma continued.  

"Thank you for your guidance, Elder Ma!" Li Shiming felt as if a veil had been lifted from his eyes and bowed gratefully.  

"Here is a method to conceal the aura of spirit fire. Study it after you return. The temptation of spirit fire is too great, and since you cannot yet suppress the Solaris Spirit Fire's presence, you'd be in trouble if someone knowledgeable noticed it," Elder Ma said, tossing him a jade slip.  

Li Shiming caught it with both hands and bowed again in thanks.  

"Do you know why spirit fire is so precious?" Elder Ma asked with a smile.  

"Disciple does not. Please enlighten me," Li Shiming replied, shaking his head.  

"Only alchemists who possess spirit fire can become master alchemists capable of refining pills for mid-to-late Golden Core cultivators—or even Nascent Soul cultivators. Without spirit fire, even the purest earthfire cannot achieve the potency needed for third-grade intermediate or higher pills," Elder Ma revealed the greatest use of spirit fire.  

Li Shiming was stunned. He never imagined the tiny flame he had stumbled upon was such a treasure.  

Thankfully, Elder Ma had warned him. Had a cultivator with ill intentions noticed it, his life might have been in danger.  

Only someone like Elder Ma—a Golden Core elder deeply familiar with flames—could detect the presence of spirit fire.  

Among the many Golden Core elders present that day, only Elder Ma had noticed the Solaris Spirit Fire.  

"Thank you, Elder Ma!" Li Shiming expressed his gratitude once more, each word sincere.  

"You possess spirit fire, and I hope our sect can nurture another master alchemist to share my workload," Elder Ma said with a chuckle before adding, "However, your spirit fire is still weak. Today, refine a batch of 'Mind-Clearing Nine Palaces Pills' using spirit carbon as a formal assessment of your alchemy skills."  

Though the bottle of pills was proof of Li Shiming's ability, Elder Ma wanted to witness his process firsthand before fully trusting him.  

The fact that every "Mind-Clearing Nine Palaces Pill" was high-grade was simply too monstrous, making Elder Ma hesitant to believe it.  

Normally, Elder Ma would never ask another alchemist to demonstrate their craft in front of him—each lineage had its secrets.  

But Li Shiming was different. Having learned everything from Elder Ma's inheritance, this request was permissible.  

"As you command, Elder Ma!" Li Shiming bowed in acknowledgment.  

Naturally, he couldn't use the magic treasure furnace. Even if Elder Ma allowed it, his spiritual energy wouldn't be enough to sustain it.  

For a Foundation Establishment cultivator, magic treasures were simply too advanced.  

He retrieved his high-grade artifact furnace and several pieces of spirit carbon.  

Then, under Elder Ma's watchful gaze, he began refining pills—from heating the furnace to adding herbs and controlling the fire, every step was scrutinized by Elder Ma's spiritual sense.  

To Elder Ma's astonishment, Li Shiming's every move was executed with flawless precision. His temperature control and herb fusion were so refined that even Elder Ma himself couldn't have done better.  

The problem was—how had Li Shiming achieved such mastery in such a short time?  

Alchemy was no easy skill to master. Otherwise, so many cultivators wouldn't struggle to even begin.  

Even herbs of the same type varied due to rainfall, soil fertility, sunlight exposure, or harvesting time, leading to subtle differences in potency.  

These minute variations could drastically alter the spiritual properties during refinement, resulting in pills of varying quality.
