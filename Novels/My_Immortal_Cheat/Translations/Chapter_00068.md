# Chapter 68: Skygate!

"This transmission is taking so long!" Zhou Zui remarked from within the spatial tunnel, enveloped by runes along with the others. He had used teleportation arrays before, but they were always instantaneous. This was his first time experiencing such a prolonged transmission.

"Crossing between states naturally takes a long time," Zhou Ying replied, a perpetually lazy smile on his face. The inky-black jade qilin, resembling a lump of coal, sat on his shoulder. The Nine States of this world were not merely nine landmasses in an ocean; they were nine colossal continents scattered across the void. Therefore, traversing the distance between them consumed a significant amount of time.

Moments later, the runes swirling around them suddenly flared with intense light. Zhou Tian narrowed his eyes, shielding them from the blinding glow.

*Boom!*

Everyone emerged from the spatial transmission tunnel, momentarily stunned.

"Is that...?" Zhou Xunchuan's bright eyes stared ahead, a dazed expression on his face. Zhou Tian was equally astonished, never expecting to witness such a sight.

Before them, suspended in the void, lay a magnificent colossal city. It emanated an aura of boundless grandeur, with the cries of dragons and phoenixes echoing from within. It stretched under the stars and moon, seemingly eternal and indestructible, imbued with an ancient majesty and flowing with immortal power.

"An ancient city in the void..." Zhang Yi murmured, slightly lost in thought. Even with his vast experience, the scene before him left him utterly amazed.

It was truly majestic, not resting on any support, but directly suspended in the cosmic starry sky, bathed in starlight—a truly breathtaking sight. Its footprint was immense; the city walls were like primeval mountain ranges, tens of thousands of feet high, stretching endlessly. The city towers were tall and imposing. A pair of thick, dark city gates stood half-closed, crafted from an unknown divine metal, still bearing traces of divine blood. Faint, ethereal phantoms roared upon them, as if capable of holding back a million troops and even ancient gods!

Moonlight spilled down, and starlight cascaded like waterfalls. Silvery star rivers hung down, making the entire ancient city appear mysterious and grand, truly a place bordering on the divine.

In the surrounding void, savage beasts roared and exotic birds circled. Some were as massive as mountains, others had wings that blotted out the sky. Each dominated its own territory, all of them ancient, extraordinary species. Overbearing flood dragons, divine deer with purple, lightning-wreathed wings, ancient fowls devouring green flood dragons—these served as mounts, each carrying an unrivaled powerhouse.

Zhou Tian's eyes flickered as he sensed an aura of ancientness and dominance. The colossal city exuded an overwhelming sense of grandeur and vastness, as if it had existed since time immemorial, coeval with heaven and earth!

Even more astonishing, in front of the colossal city lay an even vaster landmass. Its immensity defied description, and its precise shape was indefinable, as only one side was visible, shrouded in an endless, pitch-black storm—the most violent spatial turbulence, capable of tearing anything apart. In comparison to this landmass, the ancient city appeared tiny.

Everyone was stunned, even Zhou Ying and the others who had visited multiple times.

"Every time I see it, I'm still awestruck..." Wei Chuan murmured softly, his eyes lost as he gazed forward. As he spoke, two small fangs subtly peeked out.

A pillar of light shot out from the colossal city, connecting with the golden runes encircling them, guiding them into the city.

"Can't we just teleport directly into the city?" Zhou Tian asked, somewhat confused. If there was a teleportation array, why not just go straight inside instead of making it so complicated?

"This city is called Skygate! It was established during the ancient era when the Eight Realms besieged the Divine Realm. Built jointly by the Eight States, it consumed countless divine materials. It's inscribed with three Heavenly Venerate-level formations, not to mention other scattered arrays. One of these three Heavenly Venerate formations is specifically designed to seal off space, time, and all other principles around Skygate that could be used for illicit entry." Zhou Ying explained, also giving a brief history of the colossal city before them. "Because these formations are interlinked, it would be extremely difficult and not worth the effort to dismantle them after defeating the Divine Realm. That's why teleportation arrays cannot be constructed *inside* Skygate; one can only enter through this method."

As they drew closer to Skygate, more details came into view. Skygate was built from greyish-brown colossal stones, exuding an aura of primordial antiquity. It was magnificently intimidating. Its walls were covered in massive sword marks and axe gashes, from which a sharp, chilling aura still emanated even after countless ages, deterring easy approach. Soldiers stood guard.

There weren't too many soldiers, but all wore cold, metallic armor. Their long halberds seemed to cleave the sky, and their iron spears could sever the void. Like squads of heavenly soldiers, they observed all who passed. These were battle-hardened veterans, who had once campaigned across the heavens, their killing intent tearing through the sky. Now, they guarded this realm, ensuring no one dared to offend lightly.

They noticed tiny black specks moving in and out of the spatial turbulence surrounding the outer edge of the colossal landmass. Upon closer inspection, these were ships with high sails, navigating the void storms.

At Skygate's city gates, people occasionally disembarked from these ships, entering the city with joyful expressions, while others, with resolute looks, boarded divine ships to venture into the void storms.

The city was enormous, with wide streets lined with ancient trees whose branches and leaves flourished. There were many buildings: alchemy shops, weapon stores, as well as inns, taverns, and even casinos.

This was a livable city. Although situated in the void, it was separated from the vacuum of space, and there were many residents within.

It was a vibrant metropolis. Children ran around, and the streets were bustling with people, shoulders brushing as they passed.

Some even looked up, following the light pillar, and spotted them, revealing surprised expressions as they pulled nearby people into discussion.

"Why are there so many people here?" Zhou Tian asked, a strange look on his face. This was completely different from what he had expected.

"The Land of the Abandoned Gods is a huge treasure trove," Wu Hong said in a deep, booming voice. His physique was almost identical to the Marquis of the Wilderness—exceptionally tall and imposing. "Although the Eight Ancient Realms almost shattered it, countless hidden treasures still remain within, attracting countless people here. After the ancient war, the Eight States opened Skygate as a camp before the Land of the Abandoned Gods. This allows them to collect some daily fees to maintain Skygate's operations. After all, Skygate is jointly controlled by the eight major powers. Normally, at least one Heavenly Venerate formation needs to be activated, which consumes a lot of resources, and no one wants to bear the cost alone."

Skygate was practically the most formidable war fortress currently in existence. No single power would be trusted to control it independently by the others, hence it could only be jointly governed by the Eight States.

"I see..." Zhou Tian nodded in understanding. The Land of the Abandoned Gods, full of the unknown and mystery, contained countless hidden treasures, creating Skygate's current bustling scene.

The light pillar drew closer and closer to Skygate. Tianqin's outpost was in the southeastern direction of Skygate, a cluster of ancient, magnificent palaces that had originally been the base of the ancient Futian Realm, now taken over by Tianqin.

*Buzz!* The light pillar descended into the central-most palace.
