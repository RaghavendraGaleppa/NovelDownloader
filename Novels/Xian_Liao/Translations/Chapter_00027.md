# Chapter 27: Extraordinary Skill  

That evening, Zhishan arrived at Zhou Qing's bamboo cottage carrying a burlap sack and an ancient book. As for Butcher Hu, he had been accommodated elsewhere.  

The buildings of Qingfu Temple were indeed numerous—and truly dilapidated.  

"Daoist Zhishan, is this the *Huichun Talisman Manual*?" Zhou Qing pointed at the book in his hand.  

Zhishan replied, "Little Uncle-Master, you may simply address me by my Daoist name. Although Qingfu Temple has few rules, we still observe hierarchy and respect."  

Zhou Qing nodded in acknowledgment.  

Zhishan handed him the book and said, "This is the table of contents for the *Huichun Talisman Manual*. Please take a look." He then opened the burlap sack, revealing numerous books inside. Pointing at them, he continued, "These are all related to the *Huichun Talisman Manual*. I just retrieved them from Master's study and cross-checked them with the table of contents. There shouldn't be any omissions."  

Zhou Qing's expression gradually stiffened.  

Now he understood why the *Huichun Talisman Manual* was so difficult to master.  

After delivering the books, Zhishan left.  

Zhou Qing turned his attention to the sack of books. They carried a faint medicinal fragrance, likely to ward off insects. The paper itself was made of durable parchment, ensuring long-term preservation and additional insect-repellent properties.  

The sheer volume of books, if sold by weight, would fetch a considerable sum.  

This was clear evidence that Qingfu Temple had once been prosperous.  

But now, it had truly declined.  

Living off dwindling resources, it was possible that many of the Daoists who had left the temple in the past had taken valuables with them. Previously, Fushan had treated patients who sought him out, using the consultation fees for the temple's upkeep and repairs.  

However, after Fushan developed dementia and could no longer treat patients, Qingfu Temple lost its income and fell into decline.  

This was the rough outline Zhou Qing had pieced together from his conversation with Fusong earlier.  

There were likely other hidden details that Fusong and Zhishan hadn't mentioned.  

Perhaps related to the internal strife they had mentioned?  

What had caused the conflict?  

A temple of several hundred people had dwindled to a few dozen after the strife.  

Even this simple description painted a grim picture.  

Zhou Qing wasn't overly curious, but since he had become half a member of Qingfu Temple, he needed to understand the situation to avoid unforeseen enemies in the future.  

However, as a newly joined lay practitioner without formal ordination, it was impossible to ask directly.  

He noted the matter for later, knowing there was no need to rush.  

For now, his priority was reading.  

Under the oil lamp, Zhou Qing followed the table of contents and began with the first book.  

The *Huichun Talisman Manual* started each book with a brief outline, followed by numerous annotations, many of which seemed to have been added later. These were likely the notes left by his unseen senior brother, Fushan.  

The outlines were written in the same ancient script as the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* and the content he had discussed with the blacksmith. The annotations, however, were a mix of traditional and simplified characters.  

Simplified characters were commonly used in daily writing but were prohibited in imperial examinations, as they were considered vulgar.  

Modern simplified characters were derived from ancient variants, not invented out of thin air.  

With his photographic memory, Zhou Qing read smoothly.  

The more he read, the more engrossed he became, and his mind grew sharper. Though many parts were unclear, he encountered no obstacles. The words flowed through his mind like water, invigorating his spirit.  

The pages turned steadily under the oil lamp, which burned miraculously through the night.  

By dawn, Zhou Qing had finished most of the sack's contents. Far from feeling tired, his mind felt sharper, as if he had absorbed newfound wisdom.  

Stretching, he felt no fatigue despite staying up all night, though his limbs were stiff from sitting.  

He then checked his *Health Ledger*:  

- **Five Animal Frolics (Basic)**: Tiger (Proficient), Deer (Proficient), Bear (Basic), Bird (Basic), Monkey (Basic)  
- **Martial Skills**: Black Tiger Steals Heart (Proficient); Finger Flick (Proficient); *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* (Skilled).  
- **Basic Alchemy (Rudimentary)**.  
- **Literary Courage (Beginner)**.  
- **Remaining Lifespan (37 years)**.  

Zhou Qing's expression darkened.  

His lifespan had decreased by a year.  

Yet his mind felt clearer than ever, his thoughts more agile and sharp.  

Staying up late was harmful, but not to this extent.  

Recalling the night's reading, every word remained vivid in his mind, and he had gained genuine understanding, though not yet fully digested.  

Lifespan, reading, knowledge, wisdom?  

He had studied before and felt energized, but never like this.  

Should he continue?  

He glanced at the remaining books, deciding to finish them in one go. It was still early morning, and he had time.  

Losing a year of lifespan pained him, but with sufficient nourishment and practice of the Five Animal Frolics, he could recover it quickly.  

The key was understanding the cause.  

After finishing the remaining books, Zhou Qing felt a sudden clarity.  

Though he hadn't started practicing, he was confident he could master it with time.  

It was like learning math or science—he had memorized the formulas and grasped the concepts; now he just needed practice.  

He checked his *Health Ledger* again:  

- **Five Animal Frolics (Basic)**: Tiger (Proficient), Deer (Proficient), Bear (Basic), Bird (Basic), Monkey (Basic)  
- **Martial Skills**: Black Tiger Steals Heart (Proficient); Finger Flick (Proficient); *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* (Skilled).  
- **Extraordinary Skill**: *Huichun Talisman Manual* (Basic).  
- **Basic Alchemy (Rudimentary)**.  
- **Literary Courage (Beginner)**.  
- **Remaining Lifespan (37 years)**.  

A new skill had appeared—**Extraordinary Skill**, not a martial skill. His lifespan hadn't decreased further, though it might have slightly, but not enough for the ledger to show.  

**Extraordinary Skill?**  

What was this?  

The *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* was a martial skill, while the *Huichun Talisman Manual* was an extraordinary skill, suggesting the latter was more advanced.  

Indeed, the *Huichun Talisman Manual* was far more complex. Studying the *Qingfeng Talisman Manual* hadn't cost him any lifespan—or at least not enough to register.  

Mastering the *Huichun Talisman Manual* normally would have taken at least half a year to reach his current level.  

Losing a year of lifespan had actually saved him more time.  

It seemed the *Health Ledger* had accelerated his comprehension by consuming lifespan, and his heightened mental acuity suggested his spiritual aspect had also benefited. If he had to explain, it was as if his **spiritual cultivation** had improved.  

Reading nourished the spirit; martial arts nourished the body.  

This time, the spiritual nourishment had drawn from his physical reserves, hence the lifespan reduction.  

Martial arts, physical cultivation, spiritual cultivation?  

Zhou Qing sensed a progressive relationship.  

Reading was a means of spiritual cultivation, which, like a tree, drew nourishment from the soil of physical cultivation.  

His near-fatal soul projection experience was undoubtedly related.  

Taking advantage of his heightened energy, Zhou Qing practiced the Five Animal Frolics to loosen his limbs.  

After breakfast delivered by Zhishan, he headed to the main hall for his formal induction as a lay practitioner.  

The ceremony wasn't held in the main hall but in a small pavilion.  

Fusong sat cross-legged on a cushion, a portrait of the temple's founder behind him. He smiled and said, "Junior Brother, Qingfu Temple has few formalities or rigid rituals. You don't need ordination in the main hall—just pay respects to the founder here."  

Following Zhishan's guidance, Zhou Qing bowed to the portrait.  

Afterward, Fusong said, "As a lay practitioner, we won't give you a Daoist name. But privately, I'll add the character *zhi* (之) to your name. You may use it among fellow practitioners, but otherwise, your name remains unchanged."  

The suffix *zhi* denoted Daoist affiliation, as seen in names like Wang Xizhi or Wang Xianzhi. It carried no real meaning beyond religious identity.  

With the ceremony complete, Fusong scrutinized Zhou Qing and remarked, "Junior Brother, you're so young, yet your vitality seems lacking."  

Zhou Qing realized his second senior brother was astute. His physical depletion indeed manifested as weakened vitality.  

He explained his past honestly.  

Fusong nodded. "So you're not yet fifteen—your birthday is on the Mid-Autumn Festival. Born on a full moon night, your childhood was prosperous, then declined, but now fortunes rise again, like the waxing moon."  

Zhou Qing quoted, "*Men have sorrow and joy, meeting and parting; the moon has its dark and light, waxing and waning. This has been so since ancient times.*"  

Fusong's eyes lit up. "Junior Brother is truly a scholar—those words carry profound meaning." He then added, "No wonder you have some martial training. Qingfu Temple doesn't forbid joining with prior skills, especially since you're not ordained. But practicing alone risks mishaps. Let me assess your skills."  

Zhou Qing had no intention of hiding his abilities—even Miss Lin had noticed them. He also hoped to gain insights from this world's martial experts.  

Though Fusong had made a clumsy entrance the day before, his recovery—digging his fingers into the wall to steady himself—revealed exceptional skill.  

Moreover, likely due to Miss Lin's generous donation, Fusong was taking his responsibilities seriously. Zhou Qing's scholar status also played a role.  

A declining Qingfu Temple would benefit greatly if Zhou Qing passed the provincial exams and gained official rank.  

The rise and fall of temples and monasteries often hinged on connections with the powerful.  

They left the pavilion.  

Zhou Qing assumed a stance and demonstrated the Tiger Frolic.  

He executed the eight movements fluidly, then settled into a concluding posture.  

Fusong praised, "Is this your family's health art? Such a refined foundation-building technique—keep practicing it; no need to learn ours. Now, let me test you."  

Before Zhou Qing could react, Fusong grabbed his shoulder.  

The last time someone had seized his shoulder was during a scuffle with a monk sent by the Zhang family.  

Fusong was far faster. Had he exerted force, given his grip strength demonstrated the day before, Zhou Qing's collarbone would have shattered.  

Instinctively, Zhou Qing countered with Black Tiger Steals Heart.  

Fusong sensed danger and blocked, surprised by Zhou Qing's right-hand strength. Their fists met, and Fusong swayed slightly to dissipate the force while steadying Zhou Qing with his other hand.  

He sighed inwardly—another near embarrassment. Despite Zhou Qing's depleted vitality, his right arm was astonishingly strong. Was he naturally powerful?  

Fusong hadn't used his refined force techniques, or he wouldn't have needed to dissipate the impact, though that might have injured Zhou Qing.  

He smiled. "Junior Brother, you have talent. But first, restore your health before training further." He then chuckled. "I forgot—you're a scholar. Focus on health and self-defense, but prioritize the imperial exams."  

Zhou Qing agreed but asked, "Senior Brother, with your skills, you could make a name for yourself. Why stay secluded?"  

Fusong replied, "I may be strong now, but in ten or twenty years, my skills will wane. Youth and weapons trump martial arts. A decade of training can't defeat a soldier with a year of archery or swordsmanship. Train for health, but for true influence, become an official."  

Zhou Qing pondered. In Fusong's worldview, no individual could surpass societal forces. Yet he imagined a highly skilled warrior with armor and weapons could achieve terrifying feats.  

With the *Health Ledger*, he might forge a transcendent path to immortality.  

Perhaps the *Huichun Talisman Manual*, as an extraordinary skill, held the key.  

Misreading Zhou Qing's silence as martial ambition, Fusong advised, "Junior Brother, focus on restoring your vitality. With longevity, you can pass the exams, become an official, and rise to prominence. Don't neglect your true path."  

He nearly revealed his true thoughts.  

"I understand, Senior Brother."  

Passing the provincial exams was crucial for his future.  

As a provincial graduate, he could legitimately establish a foundation, secure a stable environment for cultivation, avoid trivial distractions, and access higher-level resources.  

During breaks from training, he hadn't neglected his studies—his forte.  

With the *Health Ledger*, his only real requirement was effort—the most critical factor.  

"*Health Ledger*, propel me forward!"
