# Chapter 8: The Crimsonflame Tiger

Not long after, Qin Chong began searching for spirit herbs, which naturally slowed his progress considerably.  

A few hundred miles posed no challenge for cultivators, but meticulously combing through such an area for herbs was still a vast undertaking. With just twelve people, covering half of it in a month would already be an achievement.  

However, searching for spirit herbs had its own techniques. Qin Chong had read about them in various texts and even put them into practice recently. While not foolproof, these methods certainly helped.  

Most spirit plants containing spiritual energy grew in rugged, hidden locations that met specific environmental conditions—though exceptions existed, like the Bloodspirit Fruit in Qin Chong's possession.  

After some reflection, Qin Chong realized it was akin to reading feng shui: observe the terrain and wind patterns first, then water sources and humidity, followed by soil conditions. Meeting most of these criteria significantly increased the chances of finding spirit herbs.  

Currently, he stood in the heart of a dense forest, teeming with vitality and rich in wood-attribute spiritual energy—an ideal place for spirit herbs.  

Ordinary herbs were easy to pick once found. Those under thirty to fifty years old typically had no guardian beasts, but those over sixty to seventy years were far more likely to be protected.  

The thought of guardian beasts reminded Qin Chong of the Ironback Gray Wolf that had cornered him. Yet, fate had been kind—not only did he obtain a century-old Bloodspirit Fruit, but he also inadvertently activated the Eight Trigrams Mirror in the process.  

Lost in his search, the day passed uneventfully—no herbs found, no beasts encountered.  

Nightfall meant retreating to restore his energy. Though his reserves were barely depleted, cultivation demanded diligence. Years of stagnant progress hadn't deterred him before; now, with his cultivation advancing, slacking was unthinkable.  

Yet, at midnight, his meditation was abruptly interrupted.  

A beast's roar echoed, its aura drawing closer.  

Had he been discovered? Qin Chong tensed.  

Most demonic beasts were nocturnal, hunting or seeking mates under the cover of darkness.  

Judging by the aura alone, this was a late-stage first-rank beast—comparable to a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. Far beyond his current strength. Fleeing now might still be an option.  

But recklessly darting through the wilderness at night was unwise. Escaping one beast might only attract another, making the situation worse.  

Steeling himself, Qin Chong decided to assess the situation first.  

Then, he spotted a figure frantically fleeing toward his location—a gray-robed elder in his fifties or sixties, at the seventh level of Qi Refinement. His aura was feeble, his appearance disheveled. Clearly, he intended to drag Qin Chong into his mess.  

Qin Chong cursed inwardly. If only he had a concealment technique!  

While he could suppress his cultivation level and mask his aura to some extent, it was rudimentary. Anyone determined—especially those stronger—could easily see through it.  

"Fellow Daoist, help! Save me!"  

The man reached the base of Qin Chong's towering tree and shouted up.  

Qin Chong remained silent. The late-stage first-rank beast soon came into view—a Crimsonflame Tiger, nearly thirty feet long. His heart sank.  

Crimsonflame Tigers were notoriously formidable. Two ordinary beasts of the same rank might not match one. Even a peak Qi Refinement cultivator would struggle against this late-stage first-rank specimen.  

This old fool had provoked it? Truly courting death.  

"Hurry, climb up here!" Qin Chong urged.  

"My energy is spent. I doubt I can make it," the elder gasped.  

"Just jump. I'll assist you."  

The elder leaped with all his might, barely clearing ten feet. Seizing the moment, Qin Chong cast a Wind Lifting Technique, boosting him upward. After several attempts, the elder finally reached a thick branch over thirty feet high, stabilizing himself just a few yards from Qin Chong.  

"My thanks, Fellow Daoist. I am Zhao Yin. May I know your name?"  

"Qin Chong."  

"Your aid is deeply appreciated. I shall repay this kindness in the future."  

"Enough talk. We're not safe yet."  

No sooner had Qin Chong spoken than the Crimsonflame Tiger arrived below, roaring upward. A wave of foul breath washed over them, making Qin Chong grimace.  

Yet the beast didn't attack immediately. Instead, it paced beneath the tree, growling lowly.  

Qin Chong had urged the elder to climb precisely because he noticed the tiger was also exhausted—likely as spent as the old man.  

The massive tree, thick enough to require three or four people to encircle, would be difficult for even the tiger to topple. The height should also keep them out of reach.  

As for magical attacks, the tiger's current state probably prevented it from using them.  

Still, Qin Chong had a backup plan. If the beast attacked, he could leap to another nearby tree—though none were as sturdy, they were close enough in size.  

"Fellow Daoist Zhao, how did you provoke this beast? It's notoriously vicious."  

Zhao Yin sighed. "I foolishly picked a Crimsonflame Herb without noticing the beast nearby. I've been fighting and fleeing for hours to reach this point."  

"With its thick hide, injuring it will be tough. We need a way out."  

"I'm too weak now. I must recover first. Fellow Daoist, think of something." With that, Zhao Yin closed his eyes and began meditating.  

Qin Chong nearly swore aloud.  

This old bastard had dragged him into danger and now expected him to find a way out? Unbelievable.  

But with no choice, he racked his brain for solutions.  

The tiger's pacing wasn't idle—it was subtly regaining strength while testing the tree's durability by rubbing against its trunk.  

"Fellow Daoist Zhao, hold on tight. If you fall now, you'll land straight in its jaws." Ignoring Zhao Yin's meditation, Qin Chong issued the warning bluntly.
