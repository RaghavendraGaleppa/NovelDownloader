# Chapter 34: Ye Long: Isn't This Bullying an Honest Man?!  

"Brother Chen, I've suffered such injustice—you must stand up for me!" Ye Ming pleaded with tear-filled eyes, his wrinkled face a picture of aggrieved misery.  

Even Lin Yun had to admit that the old man's acting skills were Oscar-worthy—if this were Earth, he’d have taken home a golden statue.  

"I, Ye, can endure some hardship for the sake of Huangfeng Valley. For the sect’s benefit, I’m willing to sacrifice myself!"  

Behind him, Ye Long watched his master’s performance with moist eyes. For a moment, he almost believed he had truly been wronged. But when he caught his master’s subtle gesture, he snapped back to reality—this was his cue to play the righteous victim.  

"Wuuu—"  

"Injustice! Heaven-defying injustice!"  

"Brothers and sisters! Seniors and elders! This is an outrage!"  

"Fellow Daoist Han is a pseudo-spiritual root cultivator. He obtained a Foundation Establishment Pill but feared it would bring him misfortune, so he begged my master to buy it. My master, kind-hearted as he is, couldn’t bear his pleading!"  

"So he paid for the pill!"  

"My master clearly gave him over two thousand spirit stones’ worth of treasures, yet this junior insists it was only five hundred!"  

"And now, he’s joined forces with this Lin Yun to spread rumors that my master only paid five hundred!"  

"Two thousand turned into five hundred—isn’t this just bullying an honest man?!"  

The gathered rogue cultivators erupted into murmurs.  

"Just how many spirit stones did Elder Ye really take?"  

"Did anyone actually see it with their own eyes?" Nie Ying asked, glancing around.  

To be fair, many in the crowd were swayed by Ye Ming and Ye Long’s act. Had Ye Ming been less notorious, some might have even defended him.  

"Senior Sister, you actually believe that old dog Ye Ming?" A nearby Qi Condensation disciple spat angrily. "That greedy, miserly, petty old man!"  

"He withholds our spirit stones under the pretense of safekeeping! Anyone who dares ask for them back gets humiliated—or worse, beaten to death."  

"If we’re lucky enough to find something valuable, that old dog sniffs it out and pays only a quarter of its worth, pocketing the rest under the excuse of refining pills!"  

"Once, a friend of mine found a five-hundred-year-old Blood Spirit Grass in the mortal world. That old dog took it for a measly two hundred spirit stones!"  

"And even then, he had the gall to say, ‘Do you think I’m the kind of man who breaks promises?’"  

"Disgusting!"  

"Brother, was your friend…?" Another disciple hesitantly asked.  

The disciple’s face darkened at the question.  

"If he’s this terrible, why haven’t you reported him to the Sect Master?" Nie Ying pressed, indignant yet puzzled.  

"If the Sect Master actually cared, would that old dog still be running rampant?" the disciple scoffed.  

"Ah… it’s not the Sect Master’s fault. In the end, we’re just Qi Condensation disciples. Why would he risk offending a Foundation Establishment elder for our sake?" another sighed in resignation.  

"If the Sect Master truly stood up for us lowly disciples, how would he maintain his prestige among the other Foundation Establishment elders?"  

---  

Meanwhile, in the Sect Master’s Hall.  

News of the commotion at the Hundred Tasks Hall had already reached Sect Master Zhong Lingdao. Yet he remained focused, brush in hand, calmly practicing calligraphy.  

"Senior Brother, isn’t it unwise to let this escalate?" Dan Hall’s overseer, Murong Shan, fretted. "Elder Ye, he…"  

Whether Ye Ming was truly wronged was no secret—every Foundation Establishment elder in Huangfeng Valley had their own shady dealings. How else would they cultivate on the meager sect stipends?  

Murong Shan trailed off, glancing at the elderly talisman master beside him.  

"Senior Brother Fu, isn’t Lin Yun from your Talisman Hall? Why aren’t you reining him in?"  

"How could you let him cause such chaos so soon after joining?"  

Fu Lao, who had been minding his own business, bristled at the accusation. "Am I the only one in Huangfeng Valley who can’t control his disciples?!"  

"Junior Brother Murong, why must you always target me?"  

"If you’re so concerned about Ye Ming’s fate, why don’t you handle it yourself?" Fu Lao retorted, eyes narrowing.  

"Lin Yun’s success rate for high-grade talismans is nearing forty percent! His talent is beyond anything I’ve ever seen. The only thing stopping him from becoming an intermediate talisman master is his cultivation level!"  

"Once he reaches Foundation Establishment, he’ll be unstoppable. Not to mention his ties to the Chen family’s Chen Qiaoqian and even Elder Hongfu’s disciple, Dong An’er."  

"According to Junior Brother Wang, he even injured Elder Li with ten Heavenly Thunder Pearls—and Elder Li didn’t dare retaliate. If you’re brave enough, go ahead. No one’s stopping you."  

Fu Lao smirked.  

"What?! His background and talent are that terrifying?" Murong Shan paled, then hastily bowed to Zhong Lingdao. "Senior Brother Zhong, I must say—Elder Ye brought this upon himself!"  

"My Dan Hall still has unfinished business. I’ll take my leave!"  

With that, Murong Shan fled.  

Some battles weren’t worth fighting.  

"Senior Brother Fu, end this farce," Zhong Lingdao said calmly.  

"As you command, Sect Master."  

The unspoken verdict was clear.  

---  

Back at the scene, Ye Ming grew increasingly anxious.  

"Why hasn’t the Sect Master sent anyone yet?" A sense of foreboding crept over him.  

His gaze flicked to Lin Yun and the Chen family cultivators. "Did I really kick an iron plate this time?"  

"No, no—even if they’re from the Chen family, it doesn’t matter. As long as Ye Long takes the Foundation Establishment Pill today, we can flee anywhere afterward."  

"Ah, why did I insist on refining that Qi Condensation Pill? If I’d just let him take the pill directly, none of this would’ve happened!"  

Regret gnawed at him.  

Lin Yun sneered inwardly. *A scoundrel like this would’ve gotten away with it in my past life. No point wasting words—time to act.*  

"Junior Lin, why bother arguing with this thief? Just search his soul and see the truth," Chen Yan suggested amiably.  

"Elder Chen speaks wisely." Lin Yun nodded.  

*No more talk. Time to end this.*
