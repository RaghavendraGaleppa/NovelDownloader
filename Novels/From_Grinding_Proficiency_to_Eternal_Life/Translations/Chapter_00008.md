# Chapter 8:辟谷丸

Yang Gan slowly withdrew his gaze upon hearing this, then turned and left without a word.

Only after Yang Gan had left did Xu Yunfan feel the warmth gradually returning to his body, his blood and energy churning.

That was a truly fierce gaze.

Xu Yunfan flexed his limbs, remaining silent, his chest heaving with agitation.

Being looked upon as if he were a chicken chick, easily slaughtered at will, felt utterly terrible.

Moreover...

Xu Yunfan silently glanced at Li Haomiao.

As long as he remained by the side of His Highness, Prince Yan, Yang Gan would surely seize any opportunity to eliminate him.

He had to continue increasing his proficiency.

"That man possesses excellent tempered body training. He has reached the Great Completion of Skin Tempering, his skin tough and resilient, making it difficult for ordinary blades to get close. After reaching Great Completion in Skin Tempering, all tempered body practitioners bear immense strength, capable of lifting heavy tripods with ease, and shattering stones and breaking steles is nothing to them. He is indeed a rare Great Completion master of tempered body training. If he were in the military, he would surely become a fierce general.

It is a pity that due to this tempered body training, he has been unable to step into the Sinew and Bone realm for a long time. As long as you cultivate the Copper Body Art to Great Completion, you naturally won't need to fear him, so there's no need to worry about this."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's silence, Li Haomiao couldn't help but speak up.

Cultivating tempered body training is extremely arduous; few can persist through it. The pain of having one's sinews and bones constantly damaged is something even fewer are willing to endure.

Xu Yunfan raised his head, looking somewhat curious.

"Uh, I was thinking, can this Bigu Pill really allow one to abstain from grain?"

Looking at Xu Yunfan, who seemed completely unaffected by Yang Gan's earlier intimidation, Li Haomiao was momentarily speechless. He had actually prepared himself to offer some comfort.

After thinking for a moment, he said, "This Bigu Pill is refined from dozens of precious and heavy medicinal herbs. It looks like an iron pill. If your body isn't strong enough, taking it recklessly is like consuming a deadly poison."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan stepped forward and picked up the porcelain bottle, feeling a sudden heaviness in his hand.

It's so heavy!

He was somewhat surprised. This bottle, no larger than a palm, weighed a full twenty to thirty pounds.

He opened the bottle and poured out a pill. Looking at the Bigu Pill in his palm, which looked just like an iron pill, Xu Yunfan frowned and handed it to Li Haomiao.

"Is this really a Bigu Pill?"

Li Haomiao took the Bigu Pill, first sniffed it, then swallowed it in one gulp.

Xu Yunfan, standing to the side, could even hear a "gulping" sound, like a stone falling into the stomach.

Xu Yunfan: "Aren't you afraid it's poison?"

"I'm already a废人 (cripple). To kill me, there's no need to go to such great lengths. Some want me dead, but naturally, there are others who want me alive. As long as I live, I can bring sufficient benefits to certain people.

That vile woman sees me as a thorn in her side, but there are others who see me as their rightful lord. At the very least, if I die, their own interests will suffer an unacceptable loss. For this reason, I naturally cannot die."

Li Haomiao exhaled, his stomach rumbling like thunder. With his dry energy and blood being nourished, a few strands of redness rose on his originally pale, thin cheeks.

"It's the real thing, and it's a top-grade Bigu Pill."

He looked at Xu Yunfan.

"Want to take one?"

Xu Yunfan fell silent for a moment.

"You just said that if one's physical strength isn't enough, taking a Bigu Pill is like swallowing a metallic poison?"

"Top-grade Bigu Pills are an exception. After swallowing it, it can be slowly digested without harming the body. Instead, it provides great nourishment. You're lucky."

Li Haomiao said leisurely, "There's only this one chance. For Yang Gan to use this bottle of Bigu Pills to ensure my survival, the person behind him has already reached their limit. I'm afraid something major is about to happen, which is why they're taking the risk to let me recover a little."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. He poured out a pill and swallowed it under Li Haomiao's admiring gaze.

*Gulp*

He only felt his stomach sink, and his body swayed twice.

Li Haomiao asked eagerly, "How is it?"

"I feel a bit of a stomach droop."

"Stomach droop?"

Li Haomiao understood, a look of surprise on his face.

"Interesting."

Lying on the ground for a long time, Xu Yunfan finally began to adapt. A thumb-sized Bigu Pill, weighing over two pounds, was now concentrated in a pill the size of a thumb. The heavy, sinking sensation in his stomach made him move cautiously.

Gradually, as his stomach began to digest it, wisps of warmth spread from his stomach, gently soaking into his four limbs and hundred bones. His perpetually hungry stomach was quickly filled, followed by a sense of satiety.

Xu Yunfan was inwardly amazed. He felt as if his body, like a long-dried sponge, had been thrown into the sea, continuously nourishing him. He felt that this body, which had originally been somewhat malnourished, had received a perfect supplement.

If he practiced martial arts in this state, his efficiency and proficiency gain would definitely increase significantly.

If he only ate those stone-hard flatbreads, how many points of proficiency could he gain in a day?

He immediately sat up and asked Li Haomiao.

"This pill has quite a good effect. Are there any other medicinal pills?"

It seemed that besides the martial path, this world had many other things worth exploring.

Li Haomiao: "What do you think? To have a bottle of Bigu Pills like this is already extremely不容易 (difficult)."

Xu Yunfan could only get up helplessly and pick up the pickaxe. Suddenly, he felt that while it had been just right before, it now felt a bit light.

He shook his wrist. The pickaxe in his hand seemed weightless, actually making a "whooshing" sound as it cut through the air.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's transformation in such a short time, Li Haomiao already had some speculation in his heart. He said with regret, "If you had entered a Dao Sect, you might have achieved something. It's a pity..."

"A genius like me shines wherever I go."

Listening to Xu Yunfan's shameless words, Li Haomiao's eye twitched, and he was speechless.

Slightly adapting to the long-lost feeling of fullness, Xu Yunfan cleared away the stones piled against the jade wall. Under the torchlight, the jade wall emitted a faint green glow. Staring at it for a long time seemed to draw one's mind into it.

He withdrew his gaze and continued to swing his pickaxe.

*You continue to mine, seeming to be able to distinguish the quality of the ore. Your Mining proficiency has increased.*

*You had a flash of inspiration and used the power generation method of the Copper Body Art in your mining. Your Tempered Copper Body proficiency has increased.*

*...*

*You shook your legs, seeming to grasp the power generation of the Flying Leg Technique, but upon careful consideration, you found nothing.*

*...*

In the following days, apart from necessary rest, eating, drinking, and relieving himself were all handled within the mine. Xu Yunfan devoted himself entirely to mining to temper his body and practicing the Flying Leg Technique. The notifications regarding mining and Copper Body Art proficiency on his vision kept rising, almost flooding the screen.

Just a single Bigu Pill was enough to keep him from feeling any hunger for five days.

Zhou Feng never appeared again. The last time Xu Yunfan saw him was when he was transporting iron ore. Zhou Feng was whispering with a few miners. When he saw Xu Yunfan, he just gave a cold glance, his face filled with a sigh, and quickly left.

Xu Yunfan didn't initiate a conversation either. After learning the strength of the supervisor Yang Gan, he naturally understood that Zhou Feng and his group were probably just wasting their efforts.

In recent days, not many people have died in the mine, but it's not a small number either. People die in the mine every day and are carried out.
