# Chapter 566: Nezha?

The seven Core Formation experts cooperating with Xu Yunfan this time consisted of two late-stage, three mid-stage, and two early-stage Core Formation cultivators.

Including Xu Yunfan, the nominal vanguard commander, this was the entirety of the Primordial Origin Sect's Core Formation strength invested in the early-stage expansion of the Heavenly Realm.

This lineup was considered quite luxurious for facing a realm that might possess a native True Lord.

Tianyan True Lord and Lu Chuan stood side by side in the high altitude, gazing down below.

They were Grand True Lords and would not easily set foot in a new realm. Not only would this provoke the reaction of the opposing True Lord-level power, but having already condensed their Golden Nature, they risked being targeted by the realm's Heavenly Dao if its gaze fell upon them. The Heavenly Dao would surely do everything in its power to crush them.

The Core Formation Perfection stage was a special realm.

One becomes a "Heavenly Dao Rat," condensing a先天金性 (Primordial Golden Nature). This not only signifies that one's essence, energy, and spirit have entered the realm of immortality, but also requires absorbing the foundational energy of the world to merge with it.

Tianyan True Lord flipped his palm, and a bone talisman covered in strange blood patterns appeared in his hand.

With his other hand, he made a grabbing motion in the void. An elderly man, whose琵琶骨 (collarbones) were pierced by black iron chains, was dragged out. His face was extremely haggard, and his eyes flickered with venom and despair, now suspended in the void.

This was the Heavenly Realm turncoat previously controlled by Blood Ancestor, a traitor to his own world.

Now that Blood Ancestor was dead, he had naturally fallen into Tianyan True Lord's hands. After all, Blood Ancestor's Blood Sea Foundation was extremely useful for dealing with low-level cannon fodder. A single spread of his Blood Sea could turn a land spanning ten thousand miles into a desolate wasteland.

"Open!"

Tianyan True Lord let out a low shout, and the bone talisman in his hand glowed with a brilliant blood light, causing the spatial node to fluctuate violently.

Simultaneously, he pressed a finger to the traitor's brow, forcibly extracting his origin energy and merging it into the bone talisman.

*Hum!*

An unstable portal, formed from countless twisted light patterns and blood-colored sigils, violently tore open in the void.

Through the portal, a scene of lush, vibrant mountains and forests, shrouded in mist, could be glimpsed. A thick, ancient, and profound aura, mixed with dense spiritual energy vastly different from that of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World, rushed out to meet them.

This was, the Heavenly Realm of another world.

"Now."

Tianyan True Lord looked at Xu Yunfan.

This was the vanguard, and naturally, Xu Yunfan had to enter first.

Although the danger was extreme, as long as he earned the vanguard's merit, not to mention his status within the Primordial Origin Sect, he would also gain a large number of contribution points to exchange for all kinds of heavenly treasures and spiritual materials.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath without the slightest hesitation. He took a step forward first, turning into a flash of雷光 (lightning) and instantly rushing into the portal.

Right on his heels were the seven Core Formation cultivators. Each had their own thoughts and subconsciously exchanged a glance, seeing the conspiracy in each other's eyes.

As cultivators of the Demonic Sect, who didn't have their own little schemes?

The next instant, the seven moved in unison. Various colored escape lights flashed as they entered one after another.

Following them, the nearly ten thousand Qi Condensation disciples, like a torrent unleashed from a dam, flooded into the portal with a mix of fear for the unknown world and a desire to plunder opportunities.

These people were like the lowest-level street thugs, burdened with loans like Alexander the Great, and naturally wanted to fight for a chance to rise in the world.

A Qi Condensation disciple carrying a long sword couldn't help but say excitedly, "If we get something this time, we might be able to pay off our loans and still have a huge surplus, enough to prepare the resources for Foundation Establishment too."

"Quite right, quite right!"

The Qi Condensation disciples beside him echoed in agreement.

Although the vast majority of Primordial Origin Sect disciples were selfish, if they encountered a deal that could yield a thousand percent return, they would not hesitate to bet their lives on it.

When the last Qi Condensation disciple disappeared into the portal, the elderly traitor seemed to have been drained of all his energy. However, the venom on his face suddenly erupted, turning into a mad cackle.

"Hahaha!! Fools, you've fallen into our trap! You fools of the Primordial Origin Sect, did you really think our world's Heavenly Dao is so weak? This passage is the grave we prepared for you! Luring you into this瓮 (jar) is precisely for the sake of..."

His words were cut short, because Tianyan True Lord's finger twitched slightly, and his physical body and soul instantly turned to ash.

Tianyan True Lord and Lu Chuan remained expressionless, unsurprised by this outcome.

A mere traitor, whether his betrayal had other circumstances or if it was truly a trap, were all floating clouds in the face of true power.

Their gazes pierced through the portal, closely monitoring the movements on the other side, waiting for the best opportunity to strike.

Core Formation Perfection was already an extraordinary realm. If one did not suppress their power when going to another world, they would be instantly targeted by the other world's Heavenly Dao, requiring them to achieve victory in a single stroke.

Lu Chuan's lips even curled into a playful arc.

"A grave? Very well, let's see whose grave it truly is."

He was not at all worried that this was a trap targeting Golden Core True Lords, because this small world had no existence capable of threatening a True Lord.

That Heavenly Realm Emperor only held a position of power; how could he compare to the True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect?

*Pfft!*

The moment he passed through the channel, a strong sense of spatial vertigo struck, but with Xu Yunfan's current soul strength, he recovered in an instant.

He immediately stabilized his body, and his vast spiritual sense spread out like mercury flooding the ground, vigilantly scanning his surroundings.

The next moment, a pure spiritual energy far denser than many blessed lands and caves in the Taihua Spirit Ruin World, mixed with the fresh scent of grass, trees, and earth, rushed into his nostrils.

Under his feet was solid ground covered in lush moss. Ancient trees towered around him, full of vitality, and the spiritual energy was so dense it almost formed a faint white mist.

Looking up, the sky was a clear, washed blue. In the distance, layers of mountains and peaks rose one after another, with clouds and rosy mists steaming. A thick aura of spiritual energy permeated the heavens and the earth.

"Truly a fine Heavenly Realm!"

Xu Yunfan's heart filled with joy. He instantly knew this world's potential was indeed huge. If he could obtain some heavenly treasures and spiritual materials, it would likely greatly increase his cultivation speed.

The resources and spiritual materials left behind by Chu Chengnan were already somewhat insufficient for him.

However, the solemn expression on his face had just appeared when it was replaced by a hint of surprise.

His spiritual sense rapidly spread forward. Before he could sense the aura of the Sword Cultivators from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect that Senior Brother Lu Chuan had mentioned, nor detect any possible native resistance, he first saw a scene in the distant sea of clouds that caused his heart to tremble slightly.

Above the vast and boundless sky, the clouds were like stacked mountain ranges.

There,仙光 (immortal light) shone brightly, and banners blotted out the sky!

Countless Heavenly Soldiers clad in shining silver armor and wielding cold-gleaming blades were arranged in an incredibly orderly and solemn battle formation, densely packed and standing tall on the clouds.

Once the battle formation was established, it carried a projection formed from the high condensation of pure spiritual energy and will. The combined aura of war and slaughter they emitted was like a tangible tide, bearing a majestic and tyrannical, righteous and awe-inspiring dignity, pressing down heavily.

And at the very front of the endless array of Heavenly Soldiers, where the sea of clouds churned, a speck of red light was particularly dazzling and piercing.

There, a figure stood on a cloud head, imposing and unyielding, and was firmly locking onto Xu Yunfan, who had just passed through the portal and revealed himself in the forest.

That figure was not tall, and even seemed somewhat youthful, but his aura was like a divine weapon unsheathed, its锋芒 (edge) fully exposed.
