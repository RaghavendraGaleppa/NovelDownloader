# Chapter 47: Luring the Enemy

Moreover, if the area was guarded by demonic beasts, obtaining the Scarlet Vermilion Fruit would be even more challenging.

The Hidden Wind Valley was located on the southern slope of Dragon Chant Peak. Its northern cliffs towered over a hundred zhang high, while the southern side was only several dozen zhang. The Scarlet Vermilion Fruit grew precisely on the northern cliffs.

As Qin Chong and Zhao Yin reached the valley's entrance, they immediately sensed intense fluctuations of battle energy within. Not only were there numerous cultivators, but the aura of several demonic beasts also mingled in the fray. Among them, one beast had reached the second rank—a formidable opponent.

A fierce gust of wind suddenly blasted out from the valley. Had the two not been standing at a distance from the entrance, they might have been knocked off their feet unprepared. Reacting swiftly, they dodged to the side to assess the situation inside.

"What now? There seem to be quite a few people in there," Qin Chong frowned and asked.

Zhao Yin, however, remained calm and composed. "Let's climb to the cliff top first and survey the situation."

"Climb to the top? Do you think the Scarlet Vermilion Fruit grows near the summit?"

"If it did, those people wouldn't be fighting inside—they'd already be gathered up there."

Qin Chong couldn't help but purse his lips as he followed Zhao Yin. Seeing his companion's confident demeanor, he decided not to press further and followed him up the cliff.

Though the vertical distance was only about a hundred zhang, scaling the sheer cliff face was no easy feat. The terrain was steep and pathless, forcing the two to rely on their agility, hopping from one protruding rock to another as they zigzagged their way up.

After nearly half an hour, they finally reached the summit. The space here was limited, with only a few large boulders providing enough footing for a handful of people. Crouching behind one such boulder, they peered down.

At this height, they were just beyond the maximum range of a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator's spiritual sense. Given the chaos below, it was unlikely anyone would spare the effort to scan the cliff top.

"There are three or four groups down there—nearly twenty people in total," Zhao Yin muttered under his breath.

"Look at those two factions fighting. They've gone berserk—seems like they won't stop until one side is dead."

"Mm. There are broken spirit tool fragments on the ground. Looks like some have already used teleportation talismans to flee the secret realm."

"Damn! A White-Plumed Golden-Crowned Eagle—and it's second rank!"

Just then, Qin Chong spotted a massive white raptor perched near the Scarlet Vermilion Fruit, its sharp gaze fixed on the battling cultivators below.

Amidst the skirmish, several late first-rank Cyan Demonic Wolves darted around, their fallen packmates littering the ground. Evidently, earlier arrivals had clashed with these beasts.

A well-dressed young man at the ninth level of Qi Refinement caught their attention. Tall and handsome, he carried himself with an air of superiority, watching the chaos with disdain.

"See that? Your love rival," Zhao Yin suddenly remarked, drawing a dark frown from Qin Chong.

"What nonsense? What love rival?"

"Jin Yaohui, the eldest son of the Jin family. After your fiancée broke off the engagement with you, she was set to marry into the Jin family."

Qin Chong nearly choked. *Damn this old man and his gossip!*

"Old Zhao, have you been digging into my background?"

"Digging? Your little scandal is common knowledge in Pingyang City. You're the only one who didn't know."

Qin Chong felt like spitting blood. "The Yun family really is shameless. They had to ruin my reputation over a broken engagement?"

"Well, Pingyang County isn't that big. With so many families around, news like this spreads fast."

"..."

Speechless, Qin Chong inwardly cursed, *You crafty old fox—I don't believe a word you say!*

"Smaller families always seek to attach themselves to stronger ones. Your case is nothing special."

"Enough, Old Zhao. Mock me later—right now, we need to focus on getting that Scarlet Vermilion Fruit."

"Ah, my bad. Seeing that brat's arrogant face made me lose focus."

"Unbelievable. If you dislike him, why take it out on me?"

"Alright, alright. Back to business."

"Let's hear it."

"Our biggest obstacle is that White-Plumed Golden-Crowned Eagle. If the people below can lure it away, I have a way to collect the fruit."

"How about cutting off a piece of your flesh and tossing it down? Might attract the eagle."

"Pah! My meat's too tough. You'd make better bait."

"Then we'll have to wait. Once the battle below concludes, they'll deal with the eagle."

"Fine. Keep watch—I'll rest my eyes."

Qin Chong rolled his eyes hard.

The scene reminded him of war dramas from his past life—ambush tactics never changed.

After another half-hour of fierce combat, the situation below shifted. Of the four original groups, two had been defeated and fled, with several members lost—not to death, but to teleportation talismans that whisked them out of the secret realm. The victors had also suffered casualties, each side losing one member.

The remaining two groups now faced off, tension thick, yet neither initiated further conflict.

Jin Yaohui surveyed the scene and declared, "Brother Cheng, only our two factions remain. There's no need for more fighting—how about an alliance?"

The Cheng cultivator narrowed his eyes. "An alliance? How would we split the Scarlet Vermilion Fruit?"

"Fifty-fifty. What do you say?"

"That... is acceptable. But our main obstacle is still that eagle. Do you have a plan?"

"Simple. I came prepared."

"Oh? Do tell."

"We'll set up an array here, lure the eagle down, and kill it together. Then harvesting the fruit will be easy."

"If you're so confident, I'll agree. But no betrayal afterward."

"You know my reputation, Brother Cheng."

The two groups merged and began preparations. Soon, an array took shape.

Jin Yaohui then produced a large avian egg and placed it at the array's center.

"Is that... a White-Plumed Golden-Crowned Eagle egg?" The Cheng cultivator gasped.

"If it were real, would I use it as bait? This is just a convincing replica—enough to lure it down."

At their leaders' signals, the cultivators hid around the array, lying in wait.
