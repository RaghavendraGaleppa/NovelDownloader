# Chapter 15: Blade Light in Wind and Snow

The mountain wind was strong, its howling like the weeping of ghosts, breaking many branches and stirring up the snow in the forest, mixing it with the goose-feather snow falling from the night sky. Heaven and Earth were a vast expanse of white.

Qin Ming walked alone through the wind and snow, arriving at the foot of the mountain where the patrol team had made their camp. He decided to use the captured bow and arrows; though he still considered it a "soft bow," a Newcomer's weapon was much stronger than the iron-backed bow he used before.

The fierce wind and snow continuously lashed at his face, forcing him to squint. He changed out of his thick winter clothing, donning a thin outer garment over his armor. He buried his own bow and the package he brought into a snow hole, pressing it down with heavy stones, then took the patrolmen's four iron spears and ascended the mountain.

Qin Ming approached silently, gradually climbing the peak until he was only a few tens of meters from the flat ground. Had it not been for the strong wind and heavy snow, the golden mastiff, a beast comparable in size to a fierce tiger, would likely have long since sniffed out the scent of a stranger. Even so, it seemed to sense something, pricking up its ears covered in golden patterns.

In one of the larger wooden cabins, firelight flickered, and the shadows of several people appeared in the window. In such bitter cold weather, they were drinking wine and eating fragrant, steaming yak meat from a copper pot over charcoal.

"The Fire Spring in the Blood Bamboo Forest is about to extinguish, which is a good time to deal with that kind of spiritual creature. We need to make arrangements in advance..."

The words carried on the wind, and Qin Ming yearned to hear more. Part of the patrol team was targeting a certain spiritual creature in the mountains for their Second Awakening. Unfortunately, he could not eavesdrop further, for the golden mastiff had already appeared outside its kennel, looking his way, and was about to let out a roar.

He aimed at the window, drawing his bow towards the most burly figure. Iron arrows, like flashes of lightning, pierced the night, whistling as they all shot into the wooden cabin. Someone inside grunted, and immediately all the figures ducked down. Then, the cabin's windows and doors were burst open, and several figures, using tables and door panels as shields, rushed out. They then took cover behind large trees and rocks, their gazes sharp as they searched for the hidden attacker.

The golden mastiff barked incessantly, quite imposing, its roars scattering the snowflakes in front of it. Its massive body burst with astonishing strength, charging ferociously towards Qin Ming's position.

Qin Ming temporarily ignored the mutated golden mastiff. Iron arrows, like dense raindrops, poured solely towards one person—Fu Entao. He didn't care about the other patrolmen; only a Second Awakener was truly dangerous. If he could wound Fu Entao, it would be more significant than first eliminating the others.

Unfortunately, Fu Entao was only hit by one arrow, and the injury was very light. His specially made armor provided excellent protection, and the iron arrow only penetrated half an inch into his body. After this, Fu Entao swept out with his long blade, cutting off most of the iron arrows, and using trees as cover, he rapidly closed in. He judged from the force of the arrows that his opponent had not yet undergone a Second Awakening and was not someone difficult to deal with.

It wasn't that Qin Ming lacked strength; rather, the patrolmen's hard bow couldn't withstand his thousand-jin strength, and was eventually snapped clean by him.

The mutated mastiff, its body covered in gold and black markings, arrived nearby, leaping up and pouncing towards Qin Ming. White mist emanated from its gaping maw, and its bone-white fangs were exceptionally sharp, its roar shaking the mountain forest. However, its massive body suddenly stiffened in mid-air, its roar ceasing abruptly. An iron spear, flying with terrifying speed, pierced its skull, splattering several splashes of blood. Its fierce eyes dimmed in an instant. Undeniably, it was a relatively strong mutated creature that could cause some trouble for Newcomers, but Qin Ming eliminated it with a simple spear throw—an instant kill!

With a thud, it fell five meters in front of Qin Ming.

In the distance, Feng Yi'an saw the golden mastiff's corpse hit the ground and cried out in distress, "Goldie!"

A surge of anger flared in Qin Ming's heart. To these people, the lives of the villagers outside the mountain were less important than a vicious dog, to the point of losing composure and shouting for it. He swung his right arm violently, and another iron spear was hurled, emitting a chilling whooshing sound against the wind and snow, flying towards Feng Yi'an.

The bearded Feng Yi'an was a patrolman with the potential for a Second Awakening. He reacted quickly, his muscular body rapidly shifting sideways, and defiantly swung the long blade in his hand, chopping towards the incoming iron spear. Accompanied by an ear-piercing metallic clang and flying sparks, Feng Yi'an felt his entire arm go numb, his right hand holding the blade trembling slightly, almost letting go of the hilt. His heart was horrified: how much force was that? The iron spear grazed his body and flew into a wooden cabin, shattering the thick door panel on the spot.

At this moment, Fu Entao, nearly two meters tall, stomped on the snowy ground, stirring up large waves of snow as he moved at astonishing speed, now less than ten meters from Qin Ming. What awaited him was the patrol team's specially made iron spear, like a venomous flood dragon swimming through the night, shooting towards him.

As a Second Awakener, Fu Entao's perception was incredibly keen, clearly capturing the iron spear's trajectory. Unwilling to waste an ounce of strength, his tall body merely shifted slightly, calmly dodging it. His steps did not falter at all as he rushed towards his opponent with a gale. He avoided the iron spear flashing with cold light, but behind him, another patrolman was following, lagging about ten meters behind him, directly becoming the second target. This was Qin Ming's intention: if Fu Entao blocked, so be it, but if he dodged, the thrown spear would rush towards the person following closely behind.

The patrolman behind him couldn't dodge because the distance was simply too close, and Fu Entao had just blocked his vision. "Ah..." He let out a shrill scream, pierced through the chest by the incoming iron spear. Even his armor couldn't stop it; it instantly ripped apart, fragments of armor flying. However, this obstruction altered the spear's trajectory. After deviating slightly from its original direction, with a thud, the iron spear nailed this patrolman to a tree as thick as a water bucket. Blood flowed down the spear shaft, staining the snow red. He struggled in immense pain, clearly not going to survive.

Behind him, Feng Yi'an and Shao Chengfeng felt a chill down their spines, as if they themselves were nailed to that tree, and all involuntarily retreated a few steps.

Fu Entao knew what had happened behind him, a grim expression appearing on his face. Ten meters was a mere single bound for him. His curly black hair was blown back by the cold wind, his beast-hide cloak flapped loudly. At two meters tall, the long blade in his hand was specially made, wider and sharper. He chopped straight down, as if capable of splitting mountains, incredibly fierce and brave!

Qin Ming, still as a bedrock when still, moved like thunder when in motion, fast and fierce. He sidestepped slightly to avoid that terrifying blade, and with the last iron spear gripped in his left hand, he struck the blade from the side, deflecting its trajectory.

Fu Entao's heart was slightly startled. He realized this was not someone he could easily handle; he must have undergone a Second Awakening. He pressed down on his blade with force, wanting to sweep away the iron spear and continue to fiercely chop towards his opponent, but he encountered powerful resistance. Qin Ming used the iron spear in his left hand to collide against the blade surface, scraping out a large shower of sparks, blocking the long blade to the outside of his body. He charged directly forward, slashing his wood-chopping knife in his right hand towards his opponent's exposed chest.

Fu Entao's pupils contracted. His heavy long blade surprisingly couldn't press the iron spear back, making him feel troublesome for the first time; he had met a formidable opponent. He quickly raised the dark-gold armguard on his left arm, which was engraved with mountain monster patterns, to block the wood-chopping knife, clear as a spring. An ear-piercing metallic clang erupted. Fu Entao used this to quickly retreat, moving like wind and thunder, stirring up all the snowflakes on the ground, and escaping the slightly passive situation after the initial clash. He shook his slightly numb left arm and looked down to see cracks on his armguard, which had almost been cut through. It wasn't because the opponent's blade was too sharp, but because the excessive force caused the cracks.

Due to misjudging the force of the iron arrows, he had originally intended to instantly kill this sneak attacker, but ended up being obstructed right away. He began to seriously size up the figure opposite him. Qin Ming looked at his wood-chopping knife; the blade edge was damaged, with obvious nicks. Although it was refined from fine iron, it certainly couldn't compare to the patrol team's weapons and armor. He was very clear that his strength was superior to his opponent's, but he was slightly lacking in speed. Second Awakening focused on flexibility and speed. He needed to engage in close-quarters combat with his opponent, limiting their advantage of striking and then fleeing quickly, while they misunderstood him as a Newcomer in the same domain.

"Who are you, and why are you targeting us?" Fu Entao spoke. Earlier, seeing his young face, he had thought he was an impulsive, hot-blooded youth, and planned to cripple him first then interrogate his origins. In the face of such powerful strength, he calmed down, treating him as an equal, and even becoming quite wary. After all, the opponent was simply too young. Could he be a noble's child from Scarlet Cloud City? But his clothes didn't look like it.

Qin Ming did not answer. He pointed the iron spear in his left hand forward, slightly raised the wood-chopping knife in his right, and advanced step by step, composed and calm. Though he looked young, he had a strong presence.

Fu Entao frowned, his suspicion about Qin Ming's identity growing. As Qin Ming walked out of the gloomy forest, nearing the Fire Spring area, Feng Yi'an and Shao Chengfeng recognized him. Earlier, they had found the figure familiar. Now, illuminated by the firelight, his face clearly appeared, and they were completely stunned.

"You're... Qin Ming from Double Tree Village?!" Feng Yi'an found it unbelievable. He had seen this youth several times; wasn't he only a Newcomer who had just awakened?

Qin Ming did not answer, his steps firm as he closed in on his opponent. Then, he suddenly accelerated, thrusting his long spear out. It moved like an ice serpent transforming into a dragon on the snowy plains, emitting a terrifying whooshing sound in the wind and snow. The falling heavy snow scattered explosively, and the accumulated snow on the ground also exploded.

"Surround him! Don't let him escape! I want him alive!" Fu Entao shouted quickly as he struck with his blade. His gaze was like cold lightning, looking very confident, mainly fearing that Feng Yi'an and Shao Chengfeng would be intimidated, so he was boosting their confidence.

"Let's encircle him together and finish him quickly," a burly patrolman shouted, slowly approaching with his blade raised. He wasn't blindly rushing to kill, but rather wanted to create psychological pressure on Qin Ming from nearby. Seeing this, Feng Yi'an and Shao Chengfeng followed, positioning themselves at crucial points, ready to ambush at any moment, subtly influencing the battle.

The two's offense and defense in the field were terrifying. The iron spear, leaving afterimages, moved like a dragon or snake soaring through the air, while the flashing blade light was like startling lightning on a rainy night, rapidly expanding the battlefield. Feng Yi'an's and Shao Chengfeng's expressions all suddenly changed; this youth named Qin Ming was so dominant, could their leader really suppress him?

Qin Ming and Fu Entao fought their way from the vicinity of the Fire Spring back into the dense forest. The three outside had to follow closely, cautiously surrounding him. The two rushed through the forest, and the previously intact trees suddenly crackled and snapped, large numbers of branches falling onto the snowy ground, and even thick trees crashed down with a rumble.

Suddenly, in the gloomy dense forest, a silver-white figure pounced down from a large tree, intending to ambush and kill Qin Ming. Qin Ming was clashing with Fu Entao, his back to this direction. The snow ape raised by the patrol team suddenly launched an attack, pouncing from high above, making it somewhat impossible to guard against. It was a mutated creature, its sharp claws capable of tearing apart fierce beasts. At this moment, it was extremely fierce and brutal, clawing towards Qin Ming's neck, sharp and swift.

Qin Ming had already known there was a snow ape here. After ascending the mountain, he had secretly found its location and had always been wary of all potential threats. He moved as if wind generated under his feet, exceptionally agile, avoiding the snow ape's pouncing attack. At the same time, he swung his blade back towards mid-air with a *thwack*, his wood-chopping knife cutting the ferocious snow ape in half at the waist! Ape blood splattered. It howled, and both halves of its body fell onto the snowy ground one after another, soon completely dying and becoming still.
