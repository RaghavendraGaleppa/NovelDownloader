# Chapter 13: The Storage Pouch

“Haha, I thought you found some savior, but he’s even weaker than you!” The young man swept his gaze over Zhao Di, letting out a dry chuckle. “One’s at the fourth level, one’s at the fifth level. Together, you’re still no match for this daddy. Just obediently surrender, and maybe if you make this daddy happy, I’ll spare both your lives!”

Hearing the young man's words, it was clear he had designs on the female cultivator, actually intending to commit robbery and rape.

“Pah! Dream on!” The girl spat fiercely at the young man. With a flash of white light, a dark yellow token-shaped magic tool suddenly appeared in her hand.

“You dare to murder and commit violence near Cloud Stream Market? Aren’t you afraid of a high-level cultivator passing by and executing you on the spot?!” The girl tried to intimidate her opponent, hoping to make him hesitant.

“Hmph! Don't think anyone's going to save you. It's not the beginning of the month these past few days, so no one will be passing by! You'd best listen to this daddy, and have some fun with me for a while. Maybe after we're done, you won't even want to leave this daddy!” The man didn't fall for it, continuing to taunt her.

“I wouldn't miss a eunuch, let alone you!” The girl retorted, unwilling to show weakness.

“Seeking death!” The young man flipped his right hand. After a flash of spiritual light, a foot-long, fiery-red small sword appeared in his palm as if by magic.

“Go!” the young man cried out. The fiery-red small sword drew a streak of red light, flying towards the girl like a meteor. Mid-flight, it suddenly changed direction, astonishingly attacking Zhao Di instead.

Zhao Di was greatly alarmed. He quickly slapped two prepared Vajra Talismans onto himself, instantly activating two layers of Vajra Shields. At the same time, he tried to summon his Immortal Slaying Flying Dagger to block the opponent's fiery-red small sword.

But it was too late. The fiery-red small sword's power was far beyond Zhao Di's estimation. The three layers of Vajra Shields only slightly slowed its speed and reduced a small portion of its power before being pierced like window paper. The small sword, carrying its residual might, struck Zhao Di's chest fiercely.

Only a metallic, yet not metallic, "clang" was heard. The fiery-red small sword seemed to be blocked by something and did not pierce Zhao Di, but it did send him flying several meters backward.

After assessing the situation, the young man decided to first deal with this inexplicably appearing and weakest youth, then slowly handle the beautiful girl. So, he manipulated the fiery-red small sword magic tool to feint an attack on the girl, then successfully ambushed Zhao Di.

Although he hadn't pierced the youth with a single strike, he presumed the opponent was severely injured. So, he paid no further heed and controlled the small sword to stab towards the girl.

The token-shaped magic tool summoned by the girl could emit a dark yellow barrier of light, protecting her entire body. The fiery-red small sword was actually blocked by this barrier and could not penetrate even an inch.

The young man was not anxious. He simply continuously injected spiritual energy into the small sword, gradually wearing down the spiritual energy of the opponent's shield.

He thought to himself, the spiritual energy consumed by operating an offensive magic tool certainly wouldn't be as much as that consumed by a defensive magic tool, as defensive magic tools needed to protect the entire body. Moreover, his cultivation was several levels higher than the girl's, so he naturally wasn't afraid of a spiritual energy attrition battle.

Although a stalemate had temporarily formed with both sides continuously injecting spiritual energy into their magic tools, a closer look revealed that the dark yellow barrier's light was gradually dimming, clearly indicating it wouldn't last much longer.

He believed that in less than fifteen minutes, the dark yellow barrier would collapse, and the girl's fate would be at his mercy.

At this moment, the only variable, Zhao Di, whom the young man had overlooked, climbed back up. There were still traces of blood at the corner of his mouth, indicating he had suffered a minor injury from the small sword's strike just now, but he seemed otherwise unharmed.

However, the young man didn't care. He simply added a protective barrier around himself and continued to channel spiritual energy into the fiery-red small sword.

Upon seeing the current situation, Zhao Di immediately formed hand seals, silently chanted a spell, and launched a Fireball Spell towards the young man.

With a "bang," the young man neither dodged nor evaded. The protective barrier around him merely flickered a few times before returning to normal.

A Fireball Spell cast by a low-level cultivator at the fourth level of Qi Condensation naturally couldn't pose a threat to the protective barrier activated by an eighth-level cultivator like him.

Zhao Di seemed unwilling to give up. His chanting continued, and another fireball began to form in his palm.

If Zhao Di continuously attacked with Fireball Spells, his protective barrier would eventually break. The young man simply channeled even more spiritual energy into the fiery-red small sword, aiming for a quick resolution.

Sure enough, the dark yellow barrier around the girl was growing weaker and weaker, already on the verge of collapse. Her face was deathly pale, and large beads of sweat dripped from her forehead, clearly showing her extreme exertion.

Suddenly, a massive "bang" echoed as a half-meter-diameter fireball exploded at the young man's position. After a cloud of smoke dispersed, the young man's clothes were completely incinerated, his flesh charred black, and he was devoid of any life aura. His face was unrecognizable, though his wide, startled eyes could still be vaguely discerned, filled with utter shock.

The young man had been directly blasted to death by the fireball! The fiery-red small sword, now without a controller, fell to the ground with a "plink."

The girl, who had just been struggling to hold on, was also shocked by the scene before her. Her face was as white as a sheet, her breathing ragged, and her chest heaved erratically. She collapsed onto the ground, looking at Zhao Di with a mix of shock and joy.

It turned out that Zhao Di, taking advantage of the young man's full attention on dealing with the girl and his neglect of Zhao Di, had used the Fireball Spell as a cover. He suddenly unleashed his entire fortune of over ten Fireball Talismans simultaneously, instantly blasting the young man to death.

Unleashing over ten Fireball Talismans at once was equivalent to more than a dozen Zhao Dis simultaneously attacking the young man with Fireball Spells. With the young man's eighth-level Qi Condensation cultivation, even if he didn't flee or evade and fully resisted with his protective barrier, it likely wouldn't have been a big problem. However, he had, regrettably, used the majority of his spiritual energy to control the fiery-red small sword and had not infused much spiritual energy into his protective barrier, allowing Zhao Di's sneak attack to succeed.

Zhao Di was also filled with lingering fear at this moment. Putting everything else aside, he knew he couldn't have withstood the opponent's fiery-red small sword magic tool. If that strike hadn't been coincidentally blocked by the Qiankun Small Cauldron inside his beast hide pouch, he would have long since met his demise. He secretly resolved then and there to never again perform such "chivalrous" and foolhardy acts. Without absolute certainty, cherishing his own life was paramount.

How could the girl know Zhao Di's thoughts? After a brief moment of recovery, she slowly stood up. After glancing at the young man's corpse, she walked over, removed the leather pouch from his waist, and tossed it to Zhao Di. Then, with a casual Fireball Spell, she incinerated the young man's body to ashes.

“What is this?” Zhao Di turned the leather pouch the girl threw him over in his hands. It was bulging, somewhat similar to the beast hide pouch he wore, but he couldn't see an opening.

The girl glanced at him with a surprised look and retorted, “Don't tell me you've never even seen a storage pouch before?”

“A storage pouch? So this is a storage pouch!” Zhao Di was overjoyed. He had heard of storage pouches; they were a type of spatial magic tool, practically a must-have for cultivators. Even cultivators with only a small amount of spiritual energy could use them, and they could typically hold items ten, even a hundred times larger than themselves. Furthermore, a storage pouch contained its own separate space, making it impossible for other cultivators to discern its contents from the outside with their spiritual senses. Zhao Di had always longed to possess a storage pouch, but they were quite expensive. Even in the Jian family, only high-level Qi Condensation cultivators who frequently traveled had them.

“Just inject your spiritual energy into the pouch, and you can use it. See what’s inside,” the girl explained to Zhao Di, step by step, how to use the storage pouch.

“I know how to use a storage pouch, I just didn't recognize it just now,” Zhao Di mumbled somewhat awkwardly, trying to justify himself. The precautions regarding storage pouch usage were clearly detailed in the ancient texts, and he remembered them perfectly.

First, storage pouches cannot store living beings. Any living creature placed inside will have its life force cut off and perish.

Second, the capacity of a storage pouch is limited. Based on their size, common types include ten-fold capacity storage pouches, hundred-fold capacity storage pouches, and even thousand-fold capacity storage pouches. Naturally, the larger the capacity, the more expensive the storage pouch typically is.

Third, and most importantly, the texts repeatedly emphasized that storage pouches are low-grade magic tools and do not possess an owner-recognition function. In other words, if another cultivator gets hold of your storage pouch, they can easily open it and take out its contents. Therefore, cultivators must guard their storage pouches very carefully and generally not display them prominently, lest they invite a calamitous death.

“Since you don't have a storage pouch yet, I'll give this one to you. As for this red small sword, it's mine,” the girl said. She picked up the small sword from the ground, examined it repeatedly, then happily put it away, without even asking for Zhao Di's consent.

She could tell that the small sword was a decent mid-grade magic tool, worth far more than a storage pouch, so she unhesitatingly claimed it for herself.
