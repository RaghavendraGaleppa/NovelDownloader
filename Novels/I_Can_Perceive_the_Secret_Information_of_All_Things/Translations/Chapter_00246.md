# Chapter 246: The Spiritual Vortex and the Sea Monster

Upon receiving the warning, the captain swiftly flew to the highest mast to survey the distance. Sure enough, he saw the rapidly swirling spiritual storm. The ship was being pulled toward the vortex at alarming speed—without intervention, the entire vessel would be devoured.

"Full speed left, hard to port! Burn more spirit stones at maximum capacity!" The captain began directing the crew based on his experience.

Most crew members aboard were cultivators, able to fly about their duties. Just two could efficiently handle a single sail. From his high vantage point, the captain spotted the proud face of a Daoist priest below. He recalled how this priest had warned him about the vortex earlier.

Passengers flooded the deck, witnessing the increasingly clear spiritual vortex in the distance. The weaker cultivators naturally panicked—if the ship were swallowed, the strong might survive, but they'd be at the mercy of fate. Many urgently sought updates from the crew, creating chaos aboard.

Xiao Ji stood at the bow, observing the dark-blue light less than a hundred li ahead. What began as pitch blackness gradually revealed the vortex's terrifying form.

**[Spiritual Vortex: Created by a third-tier sea monster using a deep-sea top. Preparing to consume the ship...]**

**[Profound perception gained. Cultivation +123.]**

"Captain," Xiao Ji said, "I didn't wish to speak further, but your current plan to flee may doom this ship and its passengers." He judged a third-tier sea monster—equivalent to a human Golden Core cultivator—wasn't particularly fearsome. The real challenge lay in its massive size and home advantage, allowing it to manipulate the ocean's resources.

The current vortex, for instance, wasn't purely the monster's doing but amplified by deep-sea artifacts. Knowing the vortex's nature, Xiao Ji approached the captain again, hoping the seasoned sailor would set aside pride for reason.

"No one understands navigation better than I do," the captain retorted stubbornly. 

His pride was at stake. At sea, aboard his ship, his authority had to remain absolute. Entertaining every passenger's suggestion would undermine his command. Moreover, the Daoist's claim about the vortex being monster-made sounded absurd—just another natural maritime phenomenon encountered on voyages.

The captain's skepticism stemmed from experience. A sea monster creating a spiritual vortex? Preposterous. To him, Xiao Ji's advice was baseless conjecture.

"Yet my suggestion offers better odds for everyone's survival," Xiao Ji pressed.

Finally, the captain relented slightly, if only to end the pestering. "Speak your mind, priest. But I make no promises."

"Have Golden Core or Nascent Soul cultivators prepare to fish. Those capable should hook the third-tier sea monster and subdue it," Xiao Ji proposed.

"And then?" the captain asked after a pause.

"Then beat it into submission or death," came the simple reply.

The captain nearly scoffed. Fishing amid a deadly vortex? What madness. Attempting it might see the fishermen dragged into the abyss first.

Xiao Ji had two choices: leave effortlessly as a Nascent Soul cultivator (the vortex posed no threat to his level) or stay and eliminate the monster. He chose the latter—he'd paid for this voyage and intended to enjoy it properly.

"Captain! The spirit stones are burning at maximum, but we can't break free!"

"Captain, we've lost steering control!"

Panicked reports flooded in as the ship tilted dangerously. The captain ordered the bow turned outward to slow the inevitable plunge, buying time for escape.

Some cultivators attempted to flee via flight but found the vortex's pull inescapable; several were already sucked into the depths.

Xiao Ji moved from bow to stern, casting his line.

**[The third-tier sea monster below whips its beloved deep-sea top, creating the massive vortex while gaping its maw, ready to swallow the ship.]**

**[Profound perception gained. Cultivation +134.]**

His ordinary-looking fishing rod had an infinitely extending line that plunged into the vortex.

**[The monster notices the strange hook, intrigued.]**

**[As the hook transforms into unfamiliar shapes, the monster grows fascinated—new toys!]**

Through continuous perception, Xiao Ji understood this creature: low intelligence, childlike curiosity. He made the hook shift forms—land creatures to lure it closer until finally...

"Now!"

With a mighty pull from the stern, the vortex shattered violently. Waves rocked the ship as a mountain-sized monster was hoisted into the air.

"By the gods..." murmured a Western cultivator among the spectators. She'd expected the ship to be doomed but now witnessed the impossible.

Even the two covert assassins trailing her momentarily forgot their mission, stunned by the spectacle.

The captain realized his error—had he heeded the Daoist earlier, they'd have avoided this. Experience wasn't infallible.

The monstrous catch silenced all onlookers. Fish-like yet with limbs and a bizarre cubic head, it defied nature. That a mere fishing line could haul such a behemoth...

Before the crashing monster could create catastrophic waves, Xiao Ji drew his sword. Lightning descended from the heavens, illuminating the chaotic seas. With a single fluid motion, he sheathed his blade—the monster now diced into countless pieces.

The vortex dissipated instantly. Clouds parted, revealing a moonlit sea after a cleansing downpour.

"Tiring. Time to eat—hope my roast hasn't gone cold." Under countless awestruck gazes, Xiao Ji strolled toward the premium dining area.

The envious crew upgraded his accommodations immediately: "Give the Daoist master the Celestial King Suite, all expenses covered."

En route, Xiao Ji examined a small top spinning peacefully in his palm—the artifact the sea monster had used to create the vortex, now his.
