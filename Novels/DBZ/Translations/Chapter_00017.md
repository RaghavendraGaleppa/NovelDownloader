# Chapter 17: Divination in Disguise

In his previous life, Wei Qian had heard an idiom called "the man of Qi fears the sky might fall."  

When first learning the story behind this idiom, one might think the man of Qi was foolish—why worry about whether the sky would collapse?  

But upon understanding reality and knowing that in history, the state of Qi had twice experienced meteorite impacts, one realizes the man of Qi's concerns were not entirely unfounded.  

In the cultivation world, within the borders of Yunzhou in the Zhao Kingdom, a Golden Core cultivator was undoubtedly the "sky" itself!  

Thus, Wei Qian now had to act like the man of Qi—worrying and speculating about the thoughts and potential actions of Golden Core cultivators. Otherwise, survival would be impossible.  

"Foundation Establishment cultivators may dominate a single region, but before a Golden Core cultivator, they are nothing." Thinking this, Wei Qian quietly raised his personal cultivation goals.  

At his current level, his cultivation was still too low, his perspective unable to reach higher realms. Without accurate information, he could only make wild guesses.  

Of course, even those with profound cultivation, broad vision, and extensive intelligence networks could only see slightly more than others—never the full picture.  

After all, no one in this world was truly omniscient.  

For example, while all major factions in Yunzhou knew of a demonic Golden Core cultivator arriving from the north, none realized there were not one, but two!

Zhao Kingdom, Yunzhou, Liuyun Sect's mountain gate.  

Not long ago, the Liuyun Sect's two Golden Core elders had personally acted to "invite" Wuchang Zhenren from the Soul-Shattering Mountain into their sect for a "discussion on the Dao."  

"Wuchang, you seem to be living quite comfortably in this sect," a voice transmitted via divine sense echoed in Wuchang Zhenren's mind.  

The moment the voice spoke, Wuchang Zhenren's expression flickered but quickly smoothed over. "Those two old men are watching me closely right now!"  

"Don't act recklessly. If we're exposed, all our plans will be ruined," he replied via divine sense.  

"Relax. My *Supreme Joy Illusion Heart Technique* has reached perfection—they won't detect me," the voice answered.  

Still uneasy, Wuchang Zhenren said, "Let's keep this brief. What about the Yin-Yang Sect's ruins? Have you found the hidden vault?"  

"I took great risks accompanying you on this trip."  

The voice replied, "No need to rush. That vault was left behind by an ancient major sect. If it were so easily found, would it still be waiting for us?"  

"Finding a fake vault earlier was already incredibly lucky."  

Wuchang Zhenren felt deeply disappointed. "I don't have time to waste here. The longer this drags on, the higher the chance of discovery. Once this news gets out, we won't stand a chance against the Zhao Kingdom locals."  

"I've already planned for that. I'm secretly recruiting disciples to form a small faction to search for the real vault's location."  

"However, the Yin-Yang Sect was an ancient major sect, no weaker than the Sacred Gate in its prime. I intend to bring in a few more reliable individuals to help excavate the vault."  

The owner of this mysterious voice had gone to such lengths to communicate via divine sense precisely to discuss this matter with Wuchang Zhenren.  

Wuchang Zhenren's expression shifted several times before he finally said, "Fine, but the number must be controlled, and they must be carefully vetted."  

"Don't bring in any of my old rivals—if you do, I won't cooperate!"  

"Would I make such a mistake? Buy me a few more days. I'll make further arrangements in Yunzhou."  

With that, the divine sense transmission ended.  

No third party knew of this exchange.  

But could the secret these two sought to hide truly remain concealed?  

Only the heavens knew!

Zhao Kingdom, Yunzhou, Wuling Mountain!  

After another day and night of frantic travel, Wei Qian and Li Guchen finally returned, their sense of security greatly restored.  

The Li Immortal Clan had likely already received word. At this moment, the mountain-protecting formation was operating at full strength.  

The guards, recognizing Li Guchen and Wei Qian, opened a gap in the formation with their tokens to let them in.  

"Both of you, head to the main hall at the summit immediately. The clan head and elders are waiting to see you," a guard informed them.  

Upon entering the grand hall for the second time, Wei Qian saw not only Clan Head Li Wanlong but also many of the Li Clan's elders.  

Among them, he spotted a familiar figure—Li Wanhai.  

"Li Wanhai must have escorted the young mistress back directly," Wei Qian thought before pushing the idea aside.  

"Recount the events of that day. Guchen, you first," Li Wanlong instructed.  

After Li Guchen finished, Wei Qian repeated the account.  

Having traveled together, their stories naturally matched perfectly.  

For instance, both omitted the part about killing the nine-foot-tall brute.  

Wei Qian had specifically asked Li Guchen to keep this detail hidden.  

While the act itself was logical, the fact that Wei Qian and Li Guchen had teamed up to kill a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator was simply too shocking. Wei Qian didn't want too many people to know.  

This secret could be kept from the entire Li Clan—except for one person: Li Guchen's father, Li Wanqing.  

Before their departure, Li Wanqing had given Li Guchen a *Minor Thunderclap Pearl*. Now that the pearl was gone, there had to be an explanation.  

For him, Wei Qian decided honesty was the best policy.  

After the meeting, Wei Qian visited Li Wanqing's cave abode, recounted the incident, and presented the brute's storage pouch.  

Inside the cave, Li Wanqing accepted the pouch but didn't open it. Instead, he asked Wei Qian a question:  

"What poison did you apply to your weapon?"  

Wei Qian had prepared an answer:  

"When I first entered the cultivation world, I once witnessed a great cultivator battling a venomous serpent demon. After the cultivator slew the beast and left, some of the serpent's venom remained at the scene, which I collected."  

"I used up the last of it when applying the poison."  

Silence filled the cave.  

Li Wanqing said nothing, lost in thought.  

After a long pause, Li Wanqing finally moved, tossing the storage pouch back to Wei Qian.  

"Regardless, you saved Guchen—that's a fact."  

"These are your spoils of battle; they belong to you."  

"And for saving Guchen, I have additional rewards for you. Return and await them."  

Exiting the cave, Wei Qian exhaled deeply.  

"As I thought—everything went smoothly."  

"Li Wanqing is an interesting man. All my preparations turned out unnecessary."  

Wei Qian had hidden some of the storage pouch's true treasures—three spirit herbs, a top-grade spear artifact, and a second-tier low-grade talisman—in a separate location.  

"The Li Clan's principles are truly upright," Wei Qian mused.  

Had this been a clan like the Wang Family, some might have not only taken the storage pouch but also placed Wei Qian under surveillance to ensure he hadn't hidden anything else.  

Of course, Wei Qian hadn't relied solely on trust in the Li Clan's values. His true confidence lay in his golden finger—the Dragon Pearl!  

Before returning to Wuling Mountain, Wei Qian had made this wish to the Dragon Pearl:  

"Dragon Pearl, I wish for my safe return to the Li Clan at Wuling Mountain without incident."  

The Dragon Pearl had granted the wish for one day.  

Using this indirect divination technique, Wei Qian had chosen to return to the Li Clan.  

Now, he would use it again—this time to divine the impending threat of the demonic Golden Core cultivators!
