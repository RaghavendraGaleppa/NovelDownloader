# Chapter 18: Extortion  

"Big brother, you're back!"  

The two youths were visibly excited to see Qin Chong, but the joy on their youthful faces vanished almost instantly, replaced by expressions of unease. This subtle change didn't escape Qin Chong's notice, and his brows furrowed slightly.  

The taller of the two was named Qin Peng, just fourteen years old. Despite his young age, his cultivation had already reached the fourth level of Qi Refining. Like Qin Chong, he possessed a triple spiritual root, though with slightly different attributes.  

The younger one, Qin Fei, was only twelve and had just begun his cultivation journey, currently at the second level of Qi Refining. However, his talent was remarkable—a dual spiritual root of earth and fire, which had earned him significant attention from the family. Once he reached the late stages of Qi Refining, Qin Hao, their father, planned to send him to the Canglong Valley. Such exceptional talent was truly wasted in a small family like theirs.  

Only by entering Canglong Valley and becoming an inner disciple could one access greater cultivation resources. If Qin Fei successfully built his foundation, the entire Qin family would rise in status and reap greater benefits.  

"Xiao Peng, Xiao Fei, what's with those expressions?" Qin Chong asked, ruffling their hair affectionately.  

"Big brother, we were happy to see you back, but... we also didn’t want you to return so soon," Qin Peng admitted, his voice tinged with reluctance.  

Qin Peng seemed about to say more, but Qin Fei tugged at his sleeve, stopping him mid-sentence. The small gesture didn’t escape Qin Chong’s notice.  

Qin Fei’s reaction surprised him. Despite being younger, Qin Fei displayed a sharper mind than Qin Peng. In an ordinary family, Qin Peng’s straightforward nature might have been endearing, but in the ruthless world of cultivation, lacking wit and strategy could prove fatal.  

"It's fine. I’ll go see Father first," Qin Chong said.  

Qin Fei spoke up, "Father is meeting with guests right now. You might not be able to see him yet."  

"Guests? From where?"  

"From Canglong Valley, I think."  

A sense of foreboding settled in Qin Chong’s chest.  

"I see. I’ll wait in the outer hall for a while. You two go play."  

Though Qin Peng and Qin Fei were his half-brothers—born to his stepmother, Lady Huang—the three had always gotten along well. While Lady Huang naturally favored her own children, she had never mistreated Qin Chong.  

He understood this well. A mother’s preference for her own children was only human.  

However, as Qin Peng and Qin Fei began their cultivation journeys and showed promising progress, Lady Huang’s attitude had shifted subtly. Lately, she seemed to be targeting Qin Chong at every turn.  

He knew exactly why—she wanted her own sons to inherit the family leadership. But Qin Chong had already set his sights on far greater ambitions and paid little heed to such petty schemes.  

As long as Lady Huang didn’t cross the line, he was content to turn a blind eye.  

After all, Qin Chong was a transmigrator. Logically, he could have left this small family long ago to seek better opportunities. Yet, over the years, he had grown deeply attached to the Qin family.  

The main reason? The dynamics here closely mirrored his past life.  

In his previous world, his family had been modest. Both parents worked tirelessly, leaving him in the care of his grandparents. He barely saw them throughout the year. As their careers flourished, their relationship deteriorated until they eventually divorced.  

Qin Chong remained with his grandparents, his material life improving but his emotional bonds weakening.  

Later, both parents remarried, and he unexpectedly gained two half-brothers—one from his mother’s new marriage, the other from his father’s. As he grew older, he saw them more frequently.  

Yet, resentment toward his parents festered in his heart, though he never voiced it.  

It wasn’t until he graduated and entered the workforce that he understood the hardships of life. After years of struggle and a failed relationship, he gradually came to empathize with his parents—marriage was far more complicated than he had imagined.  

But before he could reconcile with them, the mysterious bronze mirror had transported him to this world.  

Strangely, his father, Qin Hao, bore similarities to his past-life father, and Lady Huang’s treatment of him mirrored that of his stepmother in his previous life. It was as if fate had orchestrated everything with eerie precision.  

Standing outside the main hall, Qin Chong pushed aside his wandering thoughts and waited quietly.  

Despite his presence, the two men inside—both Foundation Establishment cultivators—continued their conversation without concern for being overheard.  

Qin Hao was of average height but broad-shouldered and powerfully built. His square face, adorned with a mustache, exuded authority, though he appeared unusually subdued at the moment.  

Seated in the guest seat, he deferred to the Canglong Valley cultivator—a pale, lanky man with an elongated face and narrow, disdainful eyes.  

Qin Chong had arrived just as their pleasantries ended, and the discussion turned serious.  

"Patriarch Qin, one of our outer disciples, Huo Yuanliang, was recently killed in the Lesser Cang Mountains. My investigation revealed that your son, Qin Chong, was training there at the time. If this matter isn’t clarified, I’ll have a hard time explaining it to my superiors," the man said, his tone dripping with condescension.  

His words and arrogant demeanor were grating.  

"Brother Huo, my son is only at the third level of Qi Refining and has made no progress in years. I sent him out to train precisely because of his weak cultivation. How could he possibly pose a threat to a disciple of your esteemed sect?" Qin Hao countered swiftly.  

"Patriarch Qin, let’s not be so absolute. A mere two-level difference can easily be overcome with underhanded tactics. Killing someone above one’s level isn’t unheard of."  

"Brother Huo, this is pure sophistry. If you have evidence, I’ll personally escort my son to Canglong Valley to face judgment. Do with him as you see fit."  

Qin Hao’s firm stance forced the Huo cultivator to dial back his aggression slightly.  

"Patriarch Qin, there’s no need for anger. I’m merely here to investigate."  

Listening outside, Qin Chong understood—this man’s righteous pretense was just a cover for extortion. The sheer audacity was infuriating.  

Yet, he couldn’t deny the truth: he *had* killed that man, though in self-defense.  

The extortionist had, unfortunately, picked the right target. Qin Chong could only sigh inwardly.  

"My son is right outside. Why don’t you see for yourself, Brother Huo?"  

"That would be best."  

"However, let me make one thing clear—my son’s cultivation is weak. If you employ excessive methods, don’t blame me for overstepping my bounds." Qin Hao’s tone was unyielding.  

"Of course. Against a mere third-level Qi Refining cultivator, why would we need such measures?"  

"Chong’er, come in."  

Hearing his name, Qin Chong lowered his head and entered, bowing respectfully.  

"Junior pays his respects to Elder Huo."  

Then, turning to his father, he bowed again.  

"Father."
