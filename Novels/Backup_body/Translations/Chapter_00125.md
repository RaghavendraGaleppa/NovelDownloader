# Chapter 125: Yuan Zhengfeng’s Divine Body! A New Debtor’s Opportunity!

Zhongzhou, Southeast Region, Jiangshang Prefecture, Hongshan Town.

Li Zhengjing returned to the Shi residence to stay temporarily.

His injuries were severe, but fortunately, the Tianqing Dao Treasure had preserved his life and was continuously releasing vitality to restore him.

Sensing the changes within his body, especially the half-immortal sword blade, Li Zhengjing thought to himself, *"After all, I'm still just a mortal. The overwhelming sharpness within me still inevitably harms my own body..."*

Previously, Gao Xuan had also been a mortal, but his bloodline contained traces of immortal blood, allowing him to barely endure. However, he could only prolong his life by absorbing the blood of his own immortal lineage.

Li Zhengjing, lacking such an immortal bloodline, relied entirely on the Tianqing Dao Treasure for recovery!

This time, although he had preliminarily refined the half-blade, he had repeatedly used the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi, and each strand of sword qi had been enhanced by the half-immortal sword, making it even sharper. This still damaged his body and worsened his injuries.

During the battle, his right arm had been destroyed, and he had repeatedly used the Lihuo Divine Sword, severely injuring his left arm as well.

According to Guigu Lingguan, after the battle, Li Zhengjing's internal organs, bones, muscles, and skin had all been invaded by the sword's sharpness, leaving him riddled with wounds.

Injuries of this magnitude would have been fatal to any other cultivator.

Even a true Human Immortal would have had to abandon their physical body.

"How do you feel now?" Guigu Lingguan asked.

"Not bad," Li Zhengjing replied.

"Your injuries are extremely severe. Fortunately, you've already subdued the half-blade within you, so the sharp sword qi no longer continuously erodes your body. Otherwise... even if you had the true Evergreen Saint Body, you'd likely be dead by now."

"Although I took a great risk, I was lucky enough to obtain this supreme treasure from the immortal realm." Li Zhengjing chuckled, glancing at his severed right arm. "The Tianqing Dao Treasure should be able to regenerate my arm, right?"

"If it were just the severed arm without other injuries, it would probably take about ten days to half a month to regrow," Guigu Lingguan said. "But with your body in such a severe state, the Tianqing Dao Treasure's vitality is mostly focused on repairing your other injuries, which will slow the process... It might take over a month."

"That's fine."

Li Zhengjing closed his eyes and checked the fortune on the golden page.

The faster his cultivation progressed, the sooner Thousand Illusions Divine Lord would come for him.

He roughly guessed that Thousand Illusions Divine Lord intended to seize his body before he could achieve Human Immortal status!

With only a hundred days left, he needed to find the *Taiyi Sword Refining Art* as soon as possible!

The half-immortal sword within him was actually a hidden danger—one even more terrifying than the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi!

The golden page indicated that only by obtaining the *Taiyi Sword Refining Art* from the Nine Spirits Immortal Island could he refine this half-blade from the immortal realm.

Previously, he had refrained from going to sea to wait for this opportunity from the Tianxing Cave Heaven.

"Since this opportunity was an immortal sword forged from the Tianxuan Taibai Yuan Gold Lock, the next opportunity must be the *Taiyi Sword Refining Art*."

Li Zhengjing felt a sense of urgency.

He had only a hundred days left before his final deadline!

As he thought this, he exhaled deeply, recalling the "hundred-day agreement" he had made with the former Gu Yue Peak Master. More than half the time had passed, but the Gu Yue Peak Master had yet to send any news.

"There's still over a month left before the deadline set by the Gu Yue Peak Master..."

Li Zhengjing mused, *"I wonder how far the Gu Yue Peak Master will have progressed by then?"*

Feeling somewhat exhausted, he sighed.

Noticing his fatigue, Guigu Lingguan tactfully excused himself and left the room.

Outside, he saw the Five Elements Creation Tree in the courtyard, lecturing the Duanlang Gu.

The Five Elements Creation Tree had nearly fallen into Sanyang Gong's hands and had only escaped by abandoning the Zhaoxuan Divine Mirror.

Fortunately, the Zhaoxuan Divine Mirror had been returned by the Flame God King, or else the Five Elements Creation Tree would have been beside itself with worry—after all, it was a treasure bestowed by its master!

On the other side of the courtyard, the Wall-Climbing Bird clung to the Dragon Pillar of the Hall, its usually melodious voice now wailing worse than a pig's squeal.

Of the twenty-five golden dragons within the Dragon Pillar of the Hall, three had been severed and completely dissipated, while the remaining twenty-two had been pierced by sword qi and severely injured.

It would take at least three months for the three dragons to reappear!

The recovery of the injured twenty-two dragons would likely take a year or more.

The bird's incessant wailing grated on Guigu Lingguan's nerves. He had intended to speak to the Dragon Girl, but the stupid bird's cries were unbearable, making it impossible to concentrate.

Guigu Lingguan beckoned and said, "Wall-Climbing, I have a method that might speed up the dragons' recovery."

The bird perked up immediately and fluttered over. "Uncle, what method?"

Guigu Lingguan explained, "The Dragon Pillar of the Hall needs three things to recover: spiritual energy, national fortune, and spiritual essence!"

He gestured. "Spiritual energy is easy. Just bury it under the Five Elements Creation Tree's roots, and spiritual energy will naturally gather. As for national fortune, we originally had no way to obtain it."

The bird's eyes lit up. "But now we do?"

Guigu Lingguan nodded. "Recently, the former prefect of Jiangshang Prefecture was wanted and fled. The prefect's seal he carried contains the fortune of Jiangshang Prefecture!"

The bird whispered, "But wasn't the prefect's seal sealed by the Imperial Jade Seal?"

Guigu Lingguan replied, "After the prefect was dismissed, the fortune within the seal wasn't destroyed!"

The bird murmured, "But the capital has already forged a new seal for Jiangshang Prefecture."

Guigu Lingguan said, "The new seal will gather new fortune, but it will take time to fully replace the old one. It's like how the former prefect's reputation and authority in Jiangshang Prefecture won't vanish overnight just because a new prefect takes over. It takes time to shift the people's perception..."

The bird exclaimed, "So before the new seal fully absorbs Jiangshang Prefecture's fortune, if I find the former prefect and take the old seal, I can speed up the recovery?"

Guigu Lingguan nodded. "Now we just need the last item, but that's not difficult either."

The bird looked puzzled. "Where do we find the last one?"

Guigu Lingguan didn't keep him in suspense. "You're a descendant of divine birds, with innate spiritual essence in your bloodline. Nourishing the pillar with your blood can hasten the process. Of course, you could also seek out members of the Gao family..."

The bird suddenly understood. "Their bloodline contains immortal essence, passed down through generations. It's no less potent than mine."

"Exactly. Now go!"

With that, Guigu Lingguan shooed the bird away, finally achieving some peace.

He then approached the stone dragon placed behind the Five Elements Creation Tree.

The stone dragon's body was only about ten feet long, lifelike and unscathed.

Guigu Lingguan couldn't help but give the Dragon Girl a deep look.

Among all the magical treasures, arts, and divine abilities he had encountered, the only thing capable of destroying a spirit without harming the body was the Soul-Slaying Whip from the underworld.

Yet this Dragon Girl had managed to annihilate the dragon's spirit with her bare hands, leaving the stone body intact!

"When gods perish, their divine bodies usually remain intact only if they die of old age," Guigu Lingguan mused. "In battle, regardless of the method, the divine stone body is typically shattered, causing the spirit and power to dissipate. It's extremely rare to slay a god and preserve such a complete divine body!"

He glanced at the broken jade beside the stone dragon. "Brother Yuan, are you considering taking over this dragon god's body?"

"I'm considering it," Yuan Zhengfeng replied. "Previously, I refused the Southern Domain Mother God's body—first because it was a female deity, and second because of the constraints of faith..."

Guigu Lingguan smiled. "Third, because Young Master Zhengjing needed you to unleash his Human Immortal-level combat power and fully utilize his abilities!"

Yuan Zhengfeng agreed. "Exactly. His mastery of magic power allows him to display strength surpassing even my prime. As the source of his magic power, my assistance is far more valuable than the protection of a mere god."

He sighed. "But now, with the opportunity from Tianxing Cave Heaven, Young Master Zhengjing already possesses formidable Human Immortal-level combat power. My help is no longer as crucial..."

"Indeed, it isn't," Guigu Lingguan said. "The half-immortal sword within him hasn't been fully refined. He's only barely suppressed its sharpness to prevent self-harm. From now on... you can no longer serve as his magic power source. If you enter his body, the magic power you provide will be destroyed by the sword's edge, annihilating even your residual spirit..."

"So, for Young Master Zhengjing, my staying in this broken jade is no longer useful."

Yuan Zhengfeng continued, "I once thought I'd be bound by the court's faith, but now I realize... I can survive without it."

His voice grew solemn. "Gods rely on faith and wishes because they are nearing the end of their lifespans, transferring from Human Immortal bodies into divine ones. But my spirit's lifespan is long. Even without faith to delay decay, I can live for centuries more..."

Guigu Lingguan studied the broken jade. "But if you stay in the jade, you could achieve eternal existence."

After a long silence, Yuan Zhengfeng replied, "Lingering between life and death isn't truly living."

"If you've made up your mind, I won't dissuade you. However..." Guigu Lingguan rubbed his hands together. "I've modified many bodies, but never a complete divine one. How about..."

"No! This will be my future body. I can't let you tamper with it!"

"What if I grant you a divine ability?"

"Don't joke around. Divine abilities are bestowed by heaven—that's the rule. This..."

"Young Master Zhengjing's divine ability was granted by me."

Guigu Lingguan whispered, "And... I'll modify the Heavenly Domain Divine Stone based on the characteristics of the Mansion Lord's broken jade. If successful, you'll be at least half a true god!"

Yuan Zhengfeng fell silent before asking, "What are the odds of success?"

Guigu Lingguan patted his chest. "At least forty percent. Rounding up, that's practically guaranteed!"

Meanwhile, in Jiangshang Prefecture...

The former prefect had fled, and the new one had yet to arrive.

Currently overseeing affairs was Fang Yin Divine General, still recovering from his injuries, with assistance from gods of other regions.

In this battle, the Great Zhou Dynasty had lost three gods, seen a prefect defect, suffered heavy casualties among its elite troops, and even Fang Yin Divine General had been severely wounded. The losses were staggering.

"All of this is because of Li Zhengjing!" one god said coldly. "He colluded with the Flame God King, causing the deaths of Sanyang Gong and tens of thousands of troops! And now, the body of the Valley River Dragon God lies in Shi Yuan's residence!"

If not for Li Zhengjing's terrifying display of power, the gods would have already razed Shi's residence and executed him to uphold the law!

But Li Zhengjing's strength had even given the Imperial Preceptor in the capital pause, leading to orders to stand down and avoid provocation.

Thus, Hongshan Town remained peaceful.

"Although he was the catalyst, and his alliance with the Flame God King led to my injuries and the deaths of Sanyang Gong and the troops, from his perspective, our actions were also hostile..."

Fang Yin Divine General, pale-faced, said, "The fact that the Valley River Dragon God's body was preserved intact after being slain by the little girl beside him is truly bizarre..."

He turned to the other gods. "I've sent someone to demand the return of the divine body. If he complies, it means he doesn't wish to sever ties with Great Zhou entirely."

"And if he refuses?"

Silence fell over the room.

Li Zhengjing's power had surpassed even the Imperial Preceptor's!

No single Human Immortal or god in the Great Zhou court could match him in combat!

"But can one man truly oppose an entire nation?"

If individual combat wasn't enough, they could gather multiple Human Immortals or summon the gods!

Or they could deploy massive formations or even mobilize the might of a million troops!

Such forces could trap even a Sect Master-level expert!

"But someone like him can come and go as he pleases. How could we possibly corner him?"

"Do you think he'd calmly walk into your trap and wait for death?"

Throughout history, only one person had ever dared to stride into such a setup—the Debt Master who attacked the capital eight hundred years ago.

And even then, the Debt Master had walked out alive!

"Stabilize Jiangshang Prefecture. Once matters in the capital are settled, the Imperial Preceptor will come personally."

Fang Yin Divine General added, "With Zhongzhou in turmoil and the heavens descending, the entire world is in upheaval... If this plan fails, Great Zhou's foundation will crumble. But if it succeeds, we'll subdue all factions and restore the glory of the founding emperor!"

Meanwhile, at the edge of the Southeast Region, heading due south...

Venerable Pure Dust's injuries were severe, his golden body riddled with cracks.

In Hongshan Town, he had reluctantly withdrawn, realizing he stood no chance of seizing the opportunity.

But on his way back, he had encountered the Ten Thousand Poison Gu God from the Southern Wastelands. Though he repelled the creature, his injuries worsened.

The gu poison seeped into his golden body, corroding his cultivation.

"If I can return to Cloud Empty Temple in time, I might still be saved."

Venerable Pure Dust looked ahead, then down at his body.

His golden form resisted the poison, but beneath the fading golden light, a black sheen had spread, dimming his radiance.

He realized he likely wouldn't make it back.

He stopped and descended into a lush, scenic mountain forest.

"As a monk, I broke my vows by fighting for the Tianxing Cave Heaven opportunity and harboring murderous intent toward Li Zhengjing. This must be the Buddha's punishment."

Walking by a mountain stream, he listened to the babbling water, feeling a rare tranquility. "Even mundane water can cleanse the dust from my heart..."

Reaching the stream's source, exhausted, he sat on a rock, waiting peacefully for death.

In this moment of clarity, he felt enlightened.

Suddenly, something fell from the sky—a wounded bird, likely injured by a hawk.

"You and I are fated. Before I die, let me save you."

His body was poisoned, so he dared not touch the bird. Though he had Buddhist magic, he couldn't use it to heal. However, he still carried rare medicinal herbs from Cloud Empty Temple, now useless to him.

He scattered the powder into the air.

Where it landed, grass grew, flowers bloomed, and vitality surged.

The bird revived and flew away joyfully.

Venerable Pure Dust smiled, pleased.

Then he noticed the powder had also fallen into the stream, where golden light flickered beneath the water.

Puzzled but unafraid—what did he have to fear from death?—he stepped into the stream.

The medicinal powder had awakened the fish, which now swam in formation, pointing toward something as if repaying his kindness.

Following their direction, he discovered a hidden space.

Inside sat a monk, his golden body preserved, devoid of life.

Venerable Pure Dust gasped. "Seventh Uncle?"

This was a golden arhat from Cloud Empty Temple who had vanished after the campaign against the Raging Evil Monk, his fate unknown.

So this was where he had passed away.

Venerable Pure Dust sighed. "So you rested here, Elder. Sadly, I cannot escort your remains back to the temple. I can only keep you company here."

As he moved to sit beside the golden corpse, a faint glow caught his eye.

He leaned closer and saw light emanating from the corpse's mouth.

"A relic?"

"Seventh Uncle attempted the Great Diamond Body but failed and passed away here?"

"Though he failed, this relic can cure my poison!"

Overjoyed, Venerable Pure Dust bowed deeply, retrieved the relic, and swallowed it, neutralizing the poison. *"This relic will pave my path to the Great Diamond Body. When I achieve it... I'll be a Sect Master-level figure!"*

With that thought, he collected Seventh Uncle's remains and left calmly.

Unbeknownst to him, half a day later, a figure arrived.

Holding the Soul-Slaying Whip, the figure gazed at where the golden corpse had been. "Venerable Pure Dust is clever. He took the opportunity I gave him, ensuring his future rise... Now, the opportunity held by the Cloud Empty Temple's abbot can be reclaimed."

Looking into the distance, the figure chuckled. "Does the Third Generation Ten Thousand Calamities World-Saving Heavenly Sovereign think hiding in Tianxing Cave Heaven will spare him from this tribulation?"
