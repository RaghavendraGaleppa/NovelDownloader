# Chapter 61: A Young Man's Jianghu

Even after several days, this scent was still clearly discernible to the gu worm. In contrast, blood spilled on a person, clashing with the aura of the living, would cause its lingering scent to dissipate quickly.

Xu Wangliang's expression shifted slightly as he followed Wu Changli. Two bone-marrow refinement realm cultivators from the Xu family also accompanied them. If the murderer was indeed found, they would suppress him with thunderous force.

The gu worm was extremely fast, comparable to a common person's running speed. A quarter of an hour later, the gu worm stopped before a courtyard, poised to fly inside.

Wu Changli quickly protected the gu worm and turned to look at Xu Wangliang behind him.

Xu Wangliang looked at the courtyard before him; it was a typical residence. His ears twitched slightly, but he heard no sound from within. With a flash of movement, Xu Wangliang appeared atop the courtyard wall. Indeed, it was empty inside.

The two Xu family cultivators landed in the courtyard, kicked open the door, and found it spotlessly clean. Nothing was left behind, as if no one had ever lived there.

"That sword stayed here for a while," Wu Changli, seeing no danger, entered the courtyard and pointed to a spot. That was where the scent was strongest, indicating a prolonged stay.

"Find the broker and ask about this place," Xu Wangliang said in a deep voice.

"This scoundrel is truly cautious!" The words seemed to seep from between Xu Wangliang's clenched teeth. This "cunning rabbit with three burrows" made Xu Wangliang even more furious.

"Squeak!" The gu worm let out a long chirp, and Wu Changli's face lit up with joy upon hearing it.

"The scent here was left two days ago; that person probably hasn't left Xingfen City yet!"

"Good!" Xu Wangliang nodded. Wu Changli quickly directed the gu worm to continue tracking. However, after circling the courtyard for a while, the gu worm did not fly out.

Wu Changli's expression changed, and he let out a strange, prolonged chirping sound from his mouth, somewhat resembling the gu worm's. The gu worm responded a few times, and Wu Changli's brow furrowed.

The gu worm's intelligence was not high, so Wu Changli could only communicate simply. The result of their recent communication was that this was the last place the gu worm had detected the blade.

"What's wrong?" Xu Wangliang asked.

"That sword, it seems to have vanished..."

Chen Fei looked at the twig in his hand, the battle scene from that day constantly replaying in his mind. For the past few days, Chen Fei had been summarizing the gains and losses of that battle, while also reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of his martial arts. Only through such real life-and-death combat could one truly discover their own flaws.

"Creak!" The courtyard gate creaked open, and Chi Defeng returned from outside. Many days had passed, and Chi Defeng's injuries had long since healed. Recently, he would occasionally gather information when he went out to buy food.

Chen Fei looked up and saw Chi Defeng's brow slightly furrowed.

"Pingyin County has fallen!" Chi Defeng said in a low voice.

Chen Fei was taken aback. Although he had long anticipated such an outcome, hearing it firsthand still caused a ripple in his heart.

"How do you know? Did someone from Pingyin County escape to Xingfen City?" Chen Fei asked.

Chi Defeng nodded, placed the food he was carrying on the stone table, poured two cups of wine, and first drank one himself, letting out a long sigh.

Chen Fei sat down on a chair and began drinking with Chi Defeng.
