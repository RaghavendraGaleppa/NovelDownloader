# Chapter 115: Sect Conscription

Upon hearing the female cultivator surnamed Zhang, Chu Ning felt a pang of disappointment. Although he knew that treasures for strengthening divine sense were hard to come by, he was still disheartened that even a large establishment like Cloudsea Pavilion didn't have any.

He sighed inwardly, but on second thought, it seemed quite normal. After entering the Foundation Establishment stage, cultivators universally sought items that could strengthen their divine sense. If anyone truly acquired such a treasure, they generally wouldn't bring it to the market for sale. The fundamental reason was simply that such items were exceedingly rare.

However, when he heard the female cultivator's next words, Chu Ning asked with curiosity, "What kind of item is it?"

"A Soul Stabilizing Pearl!" the female cultivator surnamed Zhang replied, opening the jade box to reveal a dull, dark bead inside. "This pearl can be used to defend against attacks from ordinary ghosts and Yin spirits. However, the user must be able to project their divine sense outwards, and it can only defend against ghost and Yin spirit attacks at the mid-Foundation Establishment level."

Chu Ning pondered for a moment, then looked up and asked, "How many spirit stones for this pearl?"

"Ten thousand low-grade spirit stones," the female cultivator surnamed Zhang stated a price that left Chu Ning somewhat dumbfounded, his expression turning odd after hearing it.

To counter ghost and Yin spirit attacks, this item would only be used under specific circumstances. Moreover, it offered no defense against ghosts or Yin spirits stronger than mid-Foundation Establishment. Its effectiveness was indeed very limited. It was only suitable for early-Foundation Establishment cultivators to use, as Qi Condensation cultivators typically couldn't project their divine sense, so why would they spend ten thousand low-grade spirit stones on this item? It was no wonder the pearl hadn't sold yet.

However, for himself, it might indeed be somewhat useful. He could project his divine sense, though reaching the mid-Foundation Establishment level still seemed a distance away. As for defending against ghost and Yin spirit attacks… Chu Ning's heart stirred, and he inexplicably thought of the Demonic Yin Sect. That demonic sect should have many such attack methods; it could indeed be used for defense. It was just that for such limited functionality, the price was truly too steep.

As Chu Ning was thinking this, the female cultivator surnamed Zhang, seeing his expression, explained with a smile, "This item is indeed priced a bit high, but it's a consignment from a fellow Daoist who entrusted Cloudsea Pavilion to sell it, so we can't adjust the price." She continued, opening the jade box, and seemingly casually said, "According to that fellow Daoist, this pearl originated from a set of artifacts belonging to an ancient cultivator. That senior was not only profoundly cultivated but also exceedingly skilled in divine sense secret arts. That fellow Daoist firmly believes this pearl holds great value; if not for his urgent need for a batch of spirit stones recently, he probably wouldn't have put this pearl up for sale."

Chu Ning listened, a hint of curiosity sparking in him. He asked, "Oh, did that ancient cultivator have a name?"

"Their specific name is unknown, only that they were referred to as Venerable Divine Dream."

Hearing the four characters "Venerable Divine Dream," Chu Ning's heart skipped a beat. However, he maintained a calm expression and said, "That's quite interesting. Did the fellow Daoist holding the Soul Stabilizing Pearl not research it further for any secrets?"

"Of course they did," the female cultivator surnamed Zhang chuckled. "In fact, our Pavilion has also studied this pearl, even inviting a late-Foundation Establishment senior to specifically investigate it with their divine sense. No secrets were discovered. As for higher-level seniors, they haven't specifically examined it."

Chu Ning nodded. Even late-Foundation Establishment cultivators had looked at it. Golden Core cultivators of a higher level likely wouldn't be interested in an item of this price. Chu Ning quickly made a decision, yet he still paused for a moment before slowly saying, "Leave this pearl for now. My elder happens to be an early-Foundation Establishment cultivator, so they might be able to use it. I'll see how many spirit stones I have left after buying other things before deciding whether to purchase it."

"Alright, what else would fellow Daoist like to buy?" The female cultivator surnamed Zhang didn't mind Chu Ning's words, merely taking them as a casual remark. She was more concerned with what Chu Ning himself wanted to buy next. After all, last time Chu Ning sold talismans, he also bought many items from her, so her smile grew even brighter.

However, the items Chu Ning wanted next were not as many as she might have imagined. He had already bought three bottles of Spirit Essence Pills from Gu Xiaoqing previously, so this time Chu Ning only bought ten bottles, costing 2,000 low-grade spirit stones. As for body-tempering spirit herbs, Chu Ning already had Golden Orchid Fruits and Iron Orchid Fruits, so he naturally didn't need any more. Chu Ning did want to buy a high-grade defensive artifact, but unfortunately, such artifacts were hard to come by; even Cloudsea Pavilion couldn't just sell them at will. Chu Ning had no choice but to give up and opted to purchase mid-grade talismans, which could also serve for self-defense and preservation. Last time, Chu Ning spent over a thousand spirit stones on low-grade mid-tier talismans, costing 200 spirit stones each. Thinking it over, Chu Ning felt that this level of defense was still not quite secure.

For instance, if he encountered disciples of the Demonic Yin Sect again, especially those with techniques like the Demonic Yin Severance, or even higher-level opponents, this defense would still be insufficient. After all, although low-grade mid-tier talismans could completely contend with powerful spells at the Qi Condensation Completion realm, and even ordinary early-Foundation Establishment cultivator spells, anyone at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation or the Completion realm would surely have a few good items on hand.

This time, Chu Ning chose to buy mid-grade mid-tier talismans. These talismans could already rival ordinary spells of mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators. Of course, relatively speaking, their price was naturally much higher. Low-grade mid-tier offensive talismans cost around 100 low-grade spirit stones, while defensive talismans cost 200 low-grade spirit stones. Some special talismans might even be more expensive. Mid-grade mid-tier offensive talismans cost around 300 low-grade spirit stones, and mid-grade defensive talismans cost around 450 spirit stones.

Since he had a considerable amount of spirit stones, Chu Ning directly bought ten mid-grade mid-tier offensive talismans and fifteen mid-grade mid-tier defensive talismans. Calculating this, the cost of the talismans alone reached 9,750 spirit stones. Adding the 2,000 spirit stones for the Spirit Essence Pills, the total was already 11,750 spirit stones.

Only then did Chu Ning say, "Please include that Soul Stabilizing Pearl for me as well. If my elder doesn't want it, I might have to trouble you to help me sell it again."

The female cultivator surnamed Zhang was slightly taken aback. When Chu Ning first mentioned the Soul Stabilizing Pearl, she thought he was just joking. She hadn't expected Chu Ning to actually buy it. However, this expression of surprise was fleeting. She quickly regained her composure and smiled at Chu Ning, "Certainly, fellow Daoist. As for the Soul Stabilizing Pearl, its price cannot be adjusted since it's a consignment from another fellow Daoist. For the rest of the items, it's eleven thousand seven hundred and fifty low-grade spirit stones, but fellow Daoist Li, you only need to pay eleven thousand five hundred spirit stones."

Chu Ning nodded slightly, indicating no objection, then handed over his spirit stone jade token from last time. The female cultivator surnamed Zhang took the jade token and asked with a smile, "Fellow Daoist Li, would you like to store the excess spirit stones in the spirit stone jade token?"

"No need," Chu Ning waved his hand. "Please exchange all the remaining spirit stones for mid-grade spirit stones."

The female cultivator surnamed Zhang was again slightly surprised but didn't ask further. She simply said, "Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment." With that, she placed the jade token into the round tray. Soon, all the items Chu Ning wanted, along with the jade token and spirit stones, were transferred back.

"Ten bottles of Spirit Essence Pills, ten mid-grade mid-tier offensive talismans, fifteen mid-grade mid-tier defensive talismans, and one Soul Stabilizing Pearl. The total is twenty-one thousand five hundred low-grade spirit stones. After deducting the spirit stones from the talismans you sold earlier, you have four thousand two hundred low-grade spirit stones remaining. Plus the one thousand low-grade spirit stones already in your jade token, that's a total of fifty-two mid-grade spirit stones here. Please inspect them, fellow Daoist."

As the female cultivator surnamed Zhang spoke, Chu Ning was already examining the items handed over to him. After confirming everything was correct, Chu Ning directly placed all the items into a storage bag, then turned and left. The female cultivator surnamed Zhang watched Chu Ning's retreating figure, a hint of curiosity in her gaze.

After cultivating the Soul Refining Art, Chu Ning's divine sense was incredibly keen. Even without turning his head, he sensed her gaze. However, he showed no expression, acting as if completely unaware as he exited the room, then left Cloudsea Pavilion.

Without lingering in the market, Chu Ning left the market and traveled by wind. Once he was in an unpopulated area, he released his Wind Chasing Shuttle, ascended into the air, and flew towards the Yanji Market. As he ascended, Chu Ning also took out the Cloudsea Pavilion jade token.

"It seems Cloudsea Pavilion in Fengxia Market will no longer be convenient for selling talismans." Chu Ning sighed softly, then squeezed hard, and the jade token instantly shattered into dust, scattering from the sky. Although he trusted Cloudsea Pavilion's reputation, Chu Ning still didn't want to take any risks. Selling so many high-quality talismans twice in a row, Chu Ning believed, would definitely draw Cloudsea Pavilion's attention. Moreover, today he had even spent such a high price to buy the Soul Stabilizing Pearl. Given his cautious nature, if there was a certain risk in going there next time, he would simply not go. As for this jade token, it naturally served no purpose by being kept.

Flying swiftly, Chu Ning soon arrived near Yanji Market. Just as he had done when coming, Chu Ning descended early and put away his Wind Chasing Shuttle. After walking a short distance and dispelling his Illusion Art, he returned to his own shop in Yanji Market.

"Spirit stones come quickly, but they go even quicker!" Chu Ning took out his storage bag, sighing softly. The thought that his transactions now involved tens of thousands of spirit stones made him inwardly emotional. This was something he had never imagined three years ago when he joined the Green Stream Sect. In fact, among Qi Condensation cultivators, very few could be like him. Whether it was other talisman masters or alchemists like Gu Xiaoqing, none could use and recover divine sense with such high intensity, nor achieve such a high success rate.

Amidst his reflections, Chu Ning quickly focused his attention on the items he had bought at a high price today. He merely glanced at the mid-grade mid-tier talismans before putting them away. These talismans were all too familiar to Chu Ning; he simply hadn't reached the cultivation level to produce such talismans himself. His gaze fell upon the jade box containing the Soul Stabilizing Pearl and the mid-grade spirit stones beside it.

He first picked up the Soul Stabilizing Pearl. At Cloudsea Pavilion, Chu Ning had been concerned about the presence of high-level cultivators or other restrictions, so he hadn't released his divine sense to inspect the Soul Stabilizing Pearl. Now, Chu Ning released his divine sense. As his divine sense penetrated the Soul Stabilizing Pearl, Chu Ning immediately felt an invisible barrier directly in front of his Niwan Palace.

"Is this the Soul Stabilizing Pearl's defensive effect?" Chu Ning thought to himself, not dwelling on it too much. Instead, he began to carefully sense the interior of the Soul Stabilizing Pearl with his divine sense. This investigation lasted for nearly half an hour. Only when Chu Ning felt his divine sense significantly depleted, yet still found nothing else, did he stop.

Frowning slightly, Chu Ning casually took out a jade slip from his storage bag. This jade slip was the one Chu Ning had obtained from Qi Chongmao, which contained the incomplete Soul Refining Art. Scanning the jade slip, Chu Ning saw four small characters after the name "Soul Refining Art": Venerable Divine Dream.

Indeed, what truly prompted Chu Ning to buy the Soul Stabilizing Pearl, besides its temporary usefulness to him, was the mention of Venerable Divine Dream in the female cultivator's casual conversation. Chu Ning remembered very clearly that this name was also inscribed on this jade slip. However, what Chu Ning was uncertain of was whether "Venerable Divine Dream" on the jade slip meant that the Soul Refining Art was created by him or merely inscribed by him. But in any case, upon learning that the Soul Stabilizing Pearl was somehow connected to Venerable Divine Dream, Chu Ning unhesitatingly decided to buy it.

Chu Ning had originally thought that since the Soul Stabilizing Pearl was related to Venerable Divine Dream, cultivating the Soul Refining Art might allow him to discover some clues within the pearl. However, after an attempt, Chu Ning had to abandon this idea.

"When I use my divine sense to examine this Soul Stabilizing Pearl, I can explore its interior completely, but there's nothing unusual. It seems my guess that I could obtain some useful information from it was too naive."

Sighing softly, Chu Ning could only put the Soul Stabilizing Pearl back into its small jade box and then into his storage bag. Fortunately, the Soul Stabilizing Pearl still had other effects. It could resist attacks from some ghosts and Yin spirits. Although the price of ten thousand spirit stones was indeed high, it wasn't a complete waste. At the same time, Chu Ning still held a glimmer of hope that the Soul Stabilizing Pearl indeed had other secrets, which he just hadn't discovered yet.

At this point, Chu Ning's gaze fell upon the mid-grade spirit stones beside him. Holding one in his hand and sensing it carefully for a moment, Chu Ning quickly felt the rich spiritual energy within. "This mid-grade spirit stone is worth 100 low-grade spirit stones, but its spiritual energy concentration, while high, is still an exaggeration to say it's a hundred times more." Chu Ning murmured to himself. "I wonder what the effect would be if I used it for cultivation."

Thinking this, Chu Ning first took out some low-grade spirit stones and began cultivating the Azurewood Evergreen Art. After reaching the eighth layer of Qi Condensation, Chu Ning's speed of absorbing spiritual energy increased even further. One low-grade spirit stone was quickly consumed. Chu Ning paused, then picked up another. He continued absorbing ten low-grade spirit stones before stopping.

"Ten low-grade spirit stones can increase the proficiency of Azurewood Evergreen Art by 1 point. After entering the eighth layer of Qi Condensation, it's indeed more difficult than the seventh layer. The seventh layer only required six low-grade spirit stones. Now I need to see the effect of Spirit Essence Pills and mid-grade spirit stones."

Chu Ning first cultivated the Soul Refining Art as a buffer, then picked up a Spirit Essence Pill and swallowed it. After experimenting, Chu Ning reached a conclusion. Sure enough, after entering the eighth layer of Qi Condensation, the effect of the Spirit Essence Pill was not as good as it was at the seventh layer. Previously, one Spirit Essence Pill could increase his proficiency by 3 points, but now, it only increased by 2 points.

A day later, after the market closed, Chu Ning resumed his cultivation. This time, Chu Ning held a mid-grade spirit stone. He cultivated for a day and a half until the mid-grade spirit stone in his hand turned into powder. Only then did Chu Ning slowly open his eyes.

[Azurewood Evergreen Art (Yellow-grade Low-tier), Third Layer (612/2100)]

When he saw the proficiency of his Azurewood Evergreen Art, a hint of joy flashed in Chu Ning's eyes. The cultivation effect of the mid-grade spirit stone exceeded his expectations. He had indeed spent a day and a half, but the effect was undoubtedly excellent; the proficiency of the Azurewood Evergreen Art had increased by a full 9 points. This was equivalent to him using 90 low-grade spirit stones in one go, but it saved him half a day in terms of time.

Chu Ning had already felt when cultivating with low-grade spirit stones the previous day that his daily limit was roughly 50 low-grade spirit stones. Moreover, because cultivation was interrupted midway, Chu Ning also wasted some time. However, using mid-grade spirit stones allowed him to cultivate in one continuous session.

"For daily use, I can continue with Spirit Essence Pills combined with the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art. When the Golden Orchid Fruits ripen later, I can use those as well. But for breakthroughs, I can choose to use mid-grade spirit stones for cultivation." A smile appeared on Chu Ning's face.

He couldn't use mid-grade spirit stones for daily cultivation yet. Firstly, he only had sixty or so of them, not a large quantity. Secondly, there were still market days to sell talismans, and he had to go to the spiritual field every day to cultivate Golden Orchid Fruits. He couldn't put all his time and energy into Qi Condensation; body tempering and soul refining also needed to keep up.

For the next nearly three months, Chu Ning primarily focused on talisman crafting, cultivation, and farming. During these three months, Chu Ning's various cultivation arts steadily improved, and his talisman crafting skills became increasingly refined. In the spiritual field, the cultivation of Golden Orchid Fruits was also very successful. The spiritual plants themselves grew well, so the flowering and fruiting time of the Golden Orchid Fruits was greatly compressed. All three batches of two hundred Iron-stemmed Orchids produced Golden Orchid Fruits. Because once they produced Golden Orchid Fruits, their absorption of spiritual energy was very fast, and the effect of催熟 (accelerated ripening) using the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art was excellent. The first batch of Golden Orchid Fruits had already ripened and been harvested, these being the original twenty Iron-stemmed Orchids that had previously produced Golden Orchid Fruits. Moreover, the second batch of eighty Iron-stemmed Orchids were also nearing ripeness. Only the third batch of Iron-stemmed Orchids, planted later, might take another month or two.

Just as Chu Ning was cultivating and farming in such an orderly manner, the appearance of Lin Changqing disrupted his plans. Moreover, the news he brought shocked Chu Ning even more.
