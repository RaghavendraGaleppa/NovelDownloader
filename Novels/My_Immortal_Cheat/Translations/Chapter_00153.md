Chapter 153: The God-King Acts

The Lord of Holy Gods rose from his seat, boundless light emanating from his body. In his hand, he clutched half of an ancient golden spear. Due to his unique nature, the God of Hunters had awakened early, but the other divine phantoms were only now truly solidifying and ready for combat.

"Kill!" the Lord of Holy Gods bellowed, pointing his ancient golden spear.

All the divine phantoms rose from their seats. Although they were forcibly condensed, their true bodies long dead, and the power they could exert was very limited, their sheer numbers compensated for it.

"Fellow Daoist Yan Mo, I'm afraid we'll need your assistance," Zhou Changsheng said to the powerful individual from Daluo Academy beside him.

Yan Mo, whose face was as flawless as jade, nodded and said in a deep voice, "There's no need for politeness. How can there be trouble when we are on the same side?"

He stepped forward, his body shimmering like crystal. In his hand appeared an ancient ruler, possessing a rustic wooden hue, as if made from ordinary timber. Numerous mottled carvings adorned its surface. An inexplicable pressure permeated the area; everyone felt an instinctive sense of awe and reverence before the ancient ruler, as if confronting a stern teacher.

"The third shattered Celestial Venerable artifact," the Lord of Thunder muttered, his eyes sparking with arcs of electricity as he stared intently at the ancient ruler.

"What a grand gesture. Aren't you afraid of perishing entirely here? All these Celestial Venerable artifacts would be for naught," the God of Death said, sitting on his divine throne, his body shrouded in black mist, yet emanating an inexplicable sense of holiness.

"The God-King's Spear and this Pantheon will be our spoils of war!" Zhou Changsheng, like the Lord of Holy Gods, had strong confidence in their side, firmly believing in their ultimate victory.

"Suppress!" Yan Mo commanded, holding the ancient ruler. Above his head, a cluster of light flowed, within which sat a small figure. Sutra chants resonated in the void, as if the small figure was expounding scriptures to all worlds.

With this small figure meditating, the light it emitted seemed to illuminate past, present, and future, rendering all methods ineffective against it. It traversed through time, as if stepping forth from the river of years.

At this moment, Yan Mo gave off an illusion, as if he did not belong to this world, this history, or even himself; he was a being traversing the long river of time. This was an inexplicable phenomenon. Neither Zhou Changsheng nor the Dao Alliance expert had displayed such astonishing anomalies when activating their Celestial Venerable artifacts. This was the only offensive Celestial Venerable artifact among the shattered ones they carried.

Yan Mo lightly waved the ancient ruler, and the small figure above his head actually stood up, its eyes opening slightly.

*Clatter!*

Bronze divine chains extended from the void, firmly binding Yan Mo. The patterns etched upon them glowed, and a powerful suppressive force enveloped him. The small figure lightly raised a hand, and all the divine chains shattered. *Pfft*, Yan Mo spat out a mouthful of blood, cracks appearing on his face, yet he forcefully swung the ruler.

*Rumble!*

In an instant, all the divine phantoms exploded into dust. Even the Lord of Holy Gods and his counterparts were affected; their ancient thrones glowed, forming protective shields. However, because the ancient ruler wasn't targeting a single individual, its power wasn't concentrated. Coupled with their utilization of a portion of the Pantheon's might, they managed to withstand it, but all the divine phantoms vanished completely.

Yan Mo fell from the void, coughing up blood. His translucent, jade-like body was covered in cracks, like a shattered piece of porcelain. Fortunately, it was already gradually healing. This ancient ruler was an offensive artifact, unlike the small gourd and small pagoda. It demanded a much greater price, and he could barely unleash a second strike.

"This cost still exceeded my expectations. The rest is up to you now," Xuan Zhenzi said with a bitter laugh. His mouth was already stuffed with many pills, yet blood still seeped from his body.

"Since that's the case, let's end this!" Zhou Changsheng put away the small gourd. Although it was a Celestial Venerable artifact, its consumption was too great. If a single strike wasn't effective, it couldn't be used excessively.

With a wave of his large hand, a silver box emerged from the void, and his palm instantly pressed upon it.

"Huh, isn't that...?" Zhou Tian, observing from the shadows, was slightly taken aback. "Wasn't that box the treasure of the Instrument Kingdom from the void storm that day?"

*Click-clack* sounds echoed as metal plates attached themselves to Zhou Changsheng's hand. In an instant, a mechanical humanoid mecha appeared, its hands clasped together, radiating golden light. Nine resplendent golden orbs floated behind its back, and the chants of myriad beings resonated.

"Your true power is indeed astonishing. I didn't expect you to possess such an extraordinary treasure," the God-King said, surprised.

"I told you," Zhou Tian said, "don't jump to conclusions until the very last moment."

"You're right," the God-King nodded in agreement.

This time, the War Buddha wasn't as colossal, only several *zhang* tall. An incomparably terrifying aura emanated from it, causing the void to tremble. Zhou Changsheng didn't hesitate. The people of the Instrument Kingdom had used a special method to lift the restrictions, allowing him to temporarily use this mecha. However, even with his astonishing physique, this Dao Lord-level mecha still exerted immense pressure on him, allowing no time for delay.

*Click-click!*

The orbs combined to form a monastic staff-saber, its blunt back spewing flames to amplify its power. Zhou Changsheng leaped up and fiercely slashed forward. Bronze chains appeared in the void, but Xuan Zhenzi activated the small pagoda to protect Zhou Changsheng and isolate him from the divine chains.

The Lord of Thunder rose to resist, unleashing ten thousand bolts of lightning, yet he was sent flying, a massive gash appearing on his chest, piercing through his body.

However, the Lord of Holy Gods' expression remained unchanged. He merely sighed lightly, rose from his seat, held up the ancient golden spear, and bowed slightly towards the supreme throne, saying, "I request that the God-King act."

"Mortal, do not jump to conclusions until the very last moment," the God-King said, gazing deeply at Zhou Tian, a slight smile on his face. He took a single step, and was already outside his divine throne.

"God-King!"
"God-King!"
"..."

The Lord of Holy Gods, the Lord of Thunder, the God of Death, and all other deities rose and bowed in reverence.

The God-King nodded, taking the ancient golden spear from the Lord of Holy Gods' hand. The spear shone brightly, its runes extending like tiny tadpoles onto his body, causing his originally illusory form to gradually solidify.

With a casual swing of the ancient spear, Zhou Changsheng was sent flying backward. The divine light of the mecha attached to him dimmed, and a massive dent appeared on its chest. Then, with another wave of his hand, countless bronze chains pierced into his body. Simultaneously, an immense number of runes flooded into his form, making his body even more solid.

If not for the dual protection of the Celestial Venerable-grade small pagoda and the mecha, Zhou Changsheng would have been directly obliterated. Even so, he was severely wounded.

"The God-King! How is this possible!" Yan Mo exclaimed in shock, his face completely paling. This was truly an unexpected turn of events.

The God-King continued to absorb something from the Pantheon and the ancient golden spear. His aura surged even higher, his body appearing as if cast from gold. The void trembled violently, as if on the verge of collapsing.

"My time is limited. I hope you can endure."
