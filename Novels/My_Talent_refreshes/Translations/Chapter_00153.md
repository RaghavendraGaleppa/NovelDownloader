**Chapter 153: Treasures to Strengthen Divine Sense**

Hearing Chu Ning say this, Cen Ziqin didn't ask further, only saying, "Perhaps those cultivators weren't entirely accurate in their observations. The Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands are all familiar with each other, and there aren't many major conflicts of interest. Generally, there isn't much fighting."

As she spoke, Cen Ziqin turned to Chu Ning again and said, "Fellow Daoist Chu, the quality of your talismans is truly excellent. Since our Cen Workshop started selling your talismans, business has indeed improved significantly. We've also had people successively inquire about purchasing mid-grade talismans. I wonder if Fellow Daoist is capable of crafting them?"

Chu Ning pondered for a moment upon hearing this. Of course, he could craft low-grade mid-tier talismans; talismans like the Profound Water Talisman, which he had already analyzed, went without saying. Having deciphered the talismanic origins, Chu Ning had mastered the art of crafting them. Even the low-grade mid-tier talismans recorded in the Profound Talisman Treasure Scroll, Chu Ning had managed to craft after recent attempts. This was clearly greatly related to his breakthrough to Qi Condensation Completion and his powerful divine sense. However, he found that whether it was the Profound Water Talisman or the low-grade mid-tier talismans from the Profound Talisman Treasure Scroll, the success rate was indeed not high. As for mid-grade mid-tier talismans, he hadn't succeeded yet. In truth, it wasn't impossible for a ninth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator to craft low-grade mid-tier talismans. Thinking of this, Chu Ning's heart stirred, and he said, "To be frank, Fellow Daoist, I can indeed attempt to craft low-grade mid-tier talismans, but currently, I cannot produce them."

Hearing that Chu Ning could actually attempt to draw low-grade mid-tier talismans, a hint of surprise appeared in Immortal Cen's eyes.

"Why can't you produce them?"

"I lack high-grade tools," Chu Ning sighed, shaking his head. "With my current ninth-layer Qi Condensation cultivation, crafting mid-grade talismans is somewhat strained. I have talisman paper, but if I had a high-grade talisman brush, along with better talisman ink, I believe there would be a certain possibility of success, even if the success rate isn't high."

Cen Ziqin immediately pressed, "Is that true, Fellow Daoist? If you had a high-grade talisman brush and excellent talisman ink, you could craft low-grade mid-tier talismans?"

Chu Ning nodded, "I have a sixty percent certainty." As he spoke, his gaze fell upon Immortal Cen, hoping she would agree immediately. He had only realized after leaving Qingxi Sect that he hadn't 'milked the sheep' enough back then; for instance, he hadn't acquired a higher-grade talisman brush.
