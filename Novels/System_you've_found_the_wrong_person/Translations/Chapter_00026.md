# Chapter 26: Ninth on the Earth Ranking, Nine Heavens Cloud Crane  

The sky was clear as if washed, the sun hanging high above.  

A gentle breeze blew, causing the veil to flutter and dance as it soared into the air.  

Zi Wu pressed one hand lightly against her injured cheek, blood seeping through the gaps between her pale fingers. The slender broken sword in her other hand trembled faintly.  

Yet at this moment, no one paid attention to Zi Wu. All eyes were fixed on Dou Changsheng.  

It was as if a divine radiance emanated from the back of his head, making him seem like the god of gods, the sovereign of all deities.  

Feeling the scorching gazes upon him, Dou Changsheng sighed inwardly.  

Those words hadn’t been his. He was certain everyone had realized that.  

He glanced at Zhao Manren, who had a knack for stirring up trouble.  

A disciple of the Divine Sword Sect stepped forward and spoke first: "Junior Sister Zi Wu was defeated in a single move."  

"She must take her leave now. Please forgive her, Hero Dou."  

Dou Changsheng patted Zhao Manren's shoulder, signaling that the mission took precedence. Not daring to delay, Zhao Manren immediately stepped forward, unwrapped the bundle, and solemnly handed the military pay to the Puluo Commandant.  

This time, the commandant didn’t dismiss them as before. Instead, he raised both arms and accepted the payment with both hands, carefully verifying its authenticity before expressing his gratitude: "Thank you!"  

His attitude was entirely different from before—night and day.  

Respect was earned through strength.  

Dou Changsheng understood this deeply now.  

The last time he had come to Jianmen Pass, he had been just an ordinary, unknown innate martial artist. Who would have cared about him?  

But now, with his reputation for slaying a True Realm innate martial artist in a single sword strike, his name had spread far and wide.  

Of course, this alone wasn’t enough to earn the commandant’s respect. The key was their misunderstanding—they believed he was a descendant of the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou. With both strength and backing, he naturally commanded attention.  

Moreover, his combat feats were terrifying—every kill had been a single-strike victory, leaving them with the impression that his true strength was unfathomable.  

Little did they know that Dou Changsheng was merely a facade.  

After expressing his thanks, the Puluo Commandant waved his stubby hand dismissively. "Recently, Hu spies have been appearing frequently outside the pass. Military affairs at Jianmen are pressing, so I cannot share a drink with you today, Hero Dou. Please forgive me."  

"When the opportunity arises, we must drink and talk through the night!"  

The commandant was already ushering them out, clearly unwilling to engage further. Dou Changsheng, too, had no desire to linger. His only purpose in returning to Jianmen Pass had been to deliver the military pay.  

With the mission complete, Dou Changsheng nodded. "Then we shall not impose further."  

"Farewell!"  

He turned and strode out, followed by Black Eagle Venerable and Zhao Manren. The three quickly left the estate. Outside, the waiting garrison commander stepped forward and bowed apologetically.  

"Recent intelligence suggests the Hu tribes are mobilizing, likely preparing to march south."  

"Jianmen Pass will now be sealed. No outsiders are permitted to remain. Please depart at once."  

Dou Changsheng calmly met the commander’s gaze. Though the man’s words were polite, his eyes were cold and unfriendly. Around them, soldiers tightened their grips on their weapons.  

A tense atmosphere settled over the scene, stirring unease.  

Black Eagle Venerable spoke first: "We leave."  

Under the escort of the garrison commander and his soldiers, the group exited Jianmen Pass.  

As the gates closed behind them, the commander inside let out a sigh of relief. The pressure of dealing with a supposed scion of the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou had been immense.  

After all, this wasn’t just about the young man’s own strength. The head of the Wang Clan—Wang Tianhe, ranked ninth on the Earth Ranking and known as the Nine Heavens Cloud Crane—was currently roaming the northern territories.  

The sudden appearance of such a figure had sent shockwaves through the region. News of his presence had reached Jianmen Pass, putting everyone on edge.  

Had Dou Changsheng caused trouble, deliberately stirring chaos to allow Wang Tianhe an excuse to enter the pass, Jianmen might have changed hands entirely.  

While the commander relaxed, the Puluo Commandant’s expression darkened as he watched Tang Ying of the Heavenly Sword Sect tend to Zi Wu’s facial wound.  

"The wound itself isn’t difficult to treat," the commandant said gravely.  

"But preventing a scar is beyond Jianmen’s capabilities. Our herbs and medicines prioritize survival over aesthetics."  

"If you wish to avoid scarring, you must return to Five Beauties Valley or have a senior bring the necessary remedies."  

Zi Wu waved her hand dismissively. "We warriors of the martial world care little for appearances."  

"This scar will serve as a constant reminder—the martial world is vast, hiding dragons and crouching tigers."  

"In this battle, though I didn’t fight with my full strength, Dou Changsheng never even drew his sword."  

"He is nearly a decade younger than me, yet he effortlessly broke my attack and wounded me."  

"Before leaving the valley, I never imagined such terrifying figures existed."  

"Even the top ten on the Human Ranking seemed only slightly stronger than me. Now I see how narrow my perspective was."  

Her spirit remained unshaken. Rather than despairing over her marred beauty, she accepted it calmly, her demeanor renewed.  

This setback hadn’t broken her—it had tempered her, completing a transformation.  

The commandant nodded approvingly. "A true disciple of a master."  

"Five Beauties Valley lives up to its reputation as a northern orthodox sect."  

Tang Ying set down the ointment and flexed his wrist. "The sudden appearance of the Nine Heavens Cloud Crane in the north has caused immense upheaval."  

"Fire Cloud True Person is restrained, completely tied down."  

"What do we do now?"  

The commandant’s expression turned solemn. "We wait."  

"The unrest in the north isn’t due to the Hu’s movements or the general’s imprisonment—it’s because the northern people suffer too much."  

"Nine Heavens Cloud Crane, ninth on the Earth Ranking."  

"Renowned across the world, revered by nations."  

"His presence alone can calm the storm—for now."  

"But he cannot suppress it forever."  

"The north is not without its own talents."  

"The previous generation’s thirteenth on the Earth Ranking, the Nine Nethers Wanderer Bai Zizai, hails from the north. Though he has long retired from worldly affairs, this crisis concerns millions of northern lives. He will not stand idly by."  

"The Wang Clan of Xiangzhou is mighty, but can it compare to the entire north?"  

"The current Earth Ranking lists five northern masters."  

"They say barren lands breed unruly folk. Our north is bitterly cold, ravaged by Hu invasions. Since ancient times, our people have been fierce, producing countless heroes. How can we be compared to the soft lands of Liang?"  

"With me leading troops south, we could breach three passes in seven days. In half a month, we could besiege Great Liang City."  

"The lands of Liang are fertile, blessed with favorable weather and dense populations—yet their martial spirit is weak. Fewer than half as many make the Earth Ranking compared to the north."  

Silence followed his words.  

Yet neither Zi Wu nor Tang Ying appeared pleased.  

Liang was prosperous but weak.  

Not only did they refuse to send troops to resist the Hu, they wouldn’t even contribute funds.  

If not for the fact that they were all subjects of the same nation, wealth would have to be taken by force.

**Chen Family Fort**  

Wang Tianhe plopped onto the ground, uncaring of the dirt staining his robes. Grabbing a roasted chicken, he tore into the breast and washed it down with a swig of wine.  

"The unrest in the north stems from the recent surge of Hu influence," he said between bites.  

"Even in the military, you must have sensed it."  

"The north has always been fierce, with a culture of martial combat. Those who rise here are battle-hardened, their experience unmatched. When they venture south, they dominate effortlessly."  

"Over time, with deliberate provocation, the impression of Liang’s weakness takes root."  

"Enduring hardship in the north pales next to the easy life in Liang—wealth, pleasure, power."  

"Take riches by sword and horse, live as masters."  

"Survival of the fittest, like beasts."  

"As tales of northern warriors thriving in Liang spread, how could the north remain content resisting the Hu, living on scraps?"  

Wang Tieqiang, who had stood motionless like a statue, finally spoke, his voice hoarse: "What’s wrong with that?"  

"Wealth and honor are won by the spear!"  

Wang Tianhe spat out a chicken bone and cursed.  

His words had fallen on deaf ears.  

This man was a true northerner, believing only in blade and steel.  

Then again, without such beliefs, how could the north produce so many experts? Five on the Earth Ranking alone—no small feat, given that the ranking spanned four great nations, numerous smaller states, and the steppes.  

Wang Tieqiang, the Spear King of the North, was one of them—seventieth on the Earth Ranking. Though at the bottom, he was still listed. And in his prime, his rank would only rise.  

After a pause, Wang Tieqiang continued, "My foster father never should have returned to the capital."  

"Liang is weak—it would fall in ten days."  

"I’ve been to the capital. A place of splendor, filled with weaklings."  

"I’ve never understood why he yielded to that demonic chancellor."  

"We don’t need the entire border army—100,000 could crush Liang, seize its wealth, and feed the north. With money and grain, we could march south to destroy Jin, north to resist the Hu."  

"At the very least, ally with Qin and Qi for protection."  

"The general showed me kindness, took me as his foster son. Otherwise, I’d support the Puluo Commandant. If Jin won’t respect us, why should we serve?"  

"Even if we reject the Hu as barbarians, are Western Qin and Eastern Qi barbarians too?"  

Wang Tieqiang smirked bitterly. "Northern savages, frontier brutes."  

"These are your mocking words, your insults."  

"Yet without the north, the Hu would have long since swept south. Under their curved blades and warhorses, would you still dare speak so?"  

"My foster father chose to enter the capital alone, losing the north’s support."  

"The Heavenly Sword Sect and Five Beauties Valley have abandoned his command. That’s the truth."  

He raised a hand to silence Wang Tianhe. "Spare me the empty talk of loyalty to the court, of us being one family."  

"My foster father endures for the greater good, for Jin, to prevent a rift between the north and the capital, to keep Liang and the court’s support against the Hu."  

"But since when did resisting the Hu become the north’s burden alone?"  

"If they abandon the north, must we grovel for scraps, enduring their blows?"  

"I care not for grand ideals."  

"I know only this—the north suffers."  

"And we hold the blades. Why should we bow as slaves when we can take what we need?"  

"My foster father is peerless in talent and virtue, a master of war, trusted by the north."  

"For years, the north has given money, given lives."  

"Men like Ai Haike—three sons, one to guard home, two to serve in the army, both dead. Such stories are not rare."  

"Yet even he was swayed by the demonic chancellor, abandoning my foster father. Because the north has lost hope."  

"Years of sacrifice, supporting my foster father, were meant to elevate his martial prowess, to fight for the north’s interests. But with the stolen military pay and his willing imprisonment, the north’s heart has changed."  

"Gentle tactics are futile. Liang and the capital will never care for us."  

"You, Wang Tianhe, speak only empty words, urging us to endure."  

"Unwilling to send a few more sacks of grain north, to save a few more lives."  

"If my foster father does not soon leave prison and return to lead the north, then tell me—will the north fall to the Hu? To Qin? To Qi?"  

"That will depend on their struggle."  

With that, Wang Tieqiang fell silent.  

Wang Tianhe sighed. The northern situation was complex, entangled with multiple nations.  

Wang Tieqiang’s words were a clear ultimatum—release the general, or the north would defect to Qin or Qi.  

Losing the north would leave Jin half-surrounded by enemies, its downfall imminent.  

Lawless, defiant of the court.  

Had the Jianmen Pass commander truly been swayed by the Hu?  

Or was this entire affair orchestrated by the general’s faction to pressure the court into releasing Yu Yun?  

The late emperor had used Yu Yun to buy over a decade of peace for the north, stability for Liang and the capital.  

But in doing so, he had nurtured a tiger.  

Wang Tianhe laughed bitterly.  

What did it matter to him?  

Love and courage—but no loyalty.  

That loyal fool, his elder brother?  

His grave’s weeds had long since grown taller than him.
