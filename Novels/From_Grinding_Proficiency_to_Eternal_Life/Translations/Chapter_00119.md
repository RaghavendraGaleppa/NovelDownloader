# Chapter 119: The Master Remains Silent

The hammerhead struck the sword blade like a torrential rain, each impact producing a crisp, resonant tremor. "The forging techniques of the Heavenly Work Cave are like carving flowers in rice grains. One could use an embroidery needle to carve the winding patterns of the Yellow River onto the blade. What a pity..."

Before he could finish, the heavy hammer slammed down onto the sword guard.

The already solidified Dark Iron suddenly cracked like a spider's web, only to quickly heal in the heat of the molten lava.

"Too much pursuit of ingenuity has stripped it of the killing intent a weapon should possess!"

Zhan Yan plunged the iron sword into the high-temperature molten rock diverted from the nearby Thunderfire Pool. The tungsten sand settled at the bottom of the pool instantly wrapped around the sword's body.

A metal shriek resembling a dragon's roar echoed through the cave. Zhan Yan's hair and beard stood on end, and a peculiar light shone from his eyes.

"The Heavenly Work forging technique is a blend I achieved after twenty years of forging here. It combines the Dragon Spine Iron Forging Method of the Divine Weapon Ridge with the Hundred Refinements Silk Thread Force of the Heavenly Work Cave."

"Originally, the Heavenly Work Cave was famous for its mechanism arts, often requiring fine work on small parts, while the Divine Weapon Ridge was renowned for forging weapons."

He pulled out the iron sword, now glowing crimson all over. The alternating light and dark patterns on the blade writhed as if they were alive.

"First, one must use the Thousand-Jun Hammer Method to beat out the iron slag, then use the Heavenly Work Cave's Silk Thread Force to penetrate and integrate the metal..."

Zhan Yan picked up a cooled scrap piece, rubbed the crystalline cross-section with his thumb, and suddenly tossed the iron sheet into the air. The shockwave generated by the collision of his two hammers precisely shattered the impurities.

By the time the iron sheet hit the ground, it had become semi-transparent, faintly revealing spiral-shaped metal flow patterns within. It was the Zhou Tian Forging Pattern that combined the essence of both schools.

Zhan Yan shook the sword and rubbed it carefully, his eyes filled with satisfaction. The quality of this sword was excellent; it was at least a Low-Grade Sharp Weapon. If the secondary quenching went well, it might even rise to Mid-Grade.

Forging a Sharp Weapon from pure Dark Iron alone was enough to prove Zhan Yan's profound skill in weapon forging.

"It's a pity... the method of forging divine weapons at the Divine Weapon Ridge has been lost. With the collapse of the mountain, the lineage was completely severed. Over these years, I have tried to use the strengths of both schools to attempt..."

Zhan Yan shook his head and said no more. He simply picked up a heavy Dark Iron hammer and handed it to Xu Yunfan.

Outside, Dark Iron was worth a hundred taels per catty. However, beneath Mount Guniu, the Heavenly Work Cave sat atop a massive iron mine, of which only thirty percent had been excavated so far. It contained a great deal of associated Dark Iron. If not for the principle that rarity creates value, the Refined Gold Hall of the Heavenly Work Cave could flood the market with Dark Iron.

The price of Dark Iron throughout the Great Zhou would likely plummet by half.

"Today, you will forge iron blanks here. I shall teach you the entry-level techniques of the Heavenly Work forging technique."

The moment the iron hammer entered his hand, Xu Yunfan's palm suddenly jumped.

A three-hundred-and-twenty-catty Dark Iron hammer would normally be heavy enough to dislocate the wrist bones of an ordinary martial artist. However, the tendons and muscles in his forearm naturally tightened, using the elasticity of his sinews to absorb seventy percent of the falling force.

Zhan Yan's eyelids twitched imperceptibly. The way this小子 held the hammer clearly resembled the starting stance of the "Holding the天河 River Backward" move from the Thirty-Six Paths of the Gale Hammer.

The movement was fluid and effortless. Zhan Yan had wanted to test him with the hammer, but he never expected Xu Yunfan to control it so deftly, even neutralizing the force he had generated.

Seeing Zhan Yan's expression, Xu Yunfan grinned.

He had been on guard against the old man's tricks. He had suffered a loss back when the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was thrown at him.

"Remember, when practicing forging initially, you need stability. The force of each strike should be roughly equal to the previous one. Hammer the entire iron blank evenly. Don't use too much force, or you'll break the internal structure of the blank. Don't use too little, or the force won't penetrate, and you won't be able to remove the impurities. For every piece of iron, the force used must be..."

*Clang!*

The sound of Xu Yunfan's first strike on the raw iron blank carried a peculiar tremor.

The moment Xu Yunfan rotated his waist and stance, the unique high-frequency vibration of the Zen Vigor was transmitted through the hammer handle into the anvil.

Ripples suddenly appeared on the surface of the dark red iron blank. Impurities were pushed toward the edges by the shockwave,析出 fine black specks in the firelight.

*You attempt to hammer the iron blank with a hammer. With a single strike, you seem to grasp a bit of forging technique.*
*Your skill, Forging, has reached the Entry Level.*
*Forging 0/500 (Entry Level)*
*Special Effects: Basic Heat Control, Harmony of Mind and Hand, Basic Shaping, Basic Forging*

Two system notifications appeared in Xu Yunfan's vision.

In the next instant, Xu Yunfan felt the forging hammer in his hand becoming more and more intuitive to use. He slightly adjusted the angle of his hammering, ensuring the iron blank was subjected to even force. The sound of the hammering became increasingly pleasant to the ear, clearly indicating that he had入门 (entered the gate) of the Heavenly Work forging technique.

Zhan Yan, who had been stroking his beard, froze.

He clearly saw the internal structure of the iron blank rapidly reorganizing under Xu Yunfan's hands. This was no beginner; this was clearly a blacksmith who had completed his apprenticeship by the furnace!

Yet he was certain Xu Yunfan had never held a forging hammer before.

"Switch to the Nine Forging Methods of Heavenly Work. I demonstrated it to you just now."

The old man suddenly tossed over a lump of black steel ingot. "Combine the third and seventh forms of the Stacked Hammer. It can greatly enhance the toughness and strength of sword weapons."

Without the slightest hesitation, Xu Yunfan followed the instructions. The trapezius muscle on his right shoulder bulged suddenly as he switched from a two-handed grip to a single-armed swing.

Every time the hammer head collided with the iron blank, the Zen Vigor, amplified by thirty percent, penetrated deep into the steel ingot.

Nine hammer strikes were completed in a single breath. With the final crisp sound, nine layers of wave-like stacked patterns appeared on the cross-section of the iron blank.

"Impossible."

Zhan Yan, who was beginning to doubt reality, slid a measuring ruler out of his sleeve. When the blade cut into the iron sheet, it sparked with a deep blue light.

He hunched over, examining the cross-section under the light of the furnace. Although it wasn't the fully formed Zhou Tian Forging Pattern, a secret technique of the Heavenly Work Cave, it was the Scale Layered Armor pattern that only veteran master craftsmen from the Forging Hall could produce.

In that single round of hammering, Xu Yunfan had penetrated the force deep into the steel ingot without missing a single bit.

When Zhan Yan had achieved this level, he had been hammering at the forging furnace for three years before succeeding.

He looked at Xu Yunfan, who seemed completely unaware of what he had done, and the complex emotions in his eyes made him feel quite uncomfortable.

After a morning of explanation and half a day of demonstration, Xu Yunfan had achieved in a dozen hammer strikes what had taken Zhan Yan three years of hard work.

Seeing Zhan Yan remain silent, Xu Yunfan asked anxiously, "Master, is there something wrong with the force I'm using?"

He glanced at the skill column on his status panel. Although Forging had reached the Entry Level, the Heavenly Work Forging Technique was still grayed out and hadn't been truly activated. Judging by Zhan Yan's expression, Xu Yunfan felt there must still be some flaw.

Zhan Yan remained silent, simply pointing to the pile of iron blanks stacked like a small mountain next to them.

"After the Martial Repository was opened a few days ago, many sects placed orders for weapons. Forge these into the shapes on the forging platform. Remember, first hammer the iron into refined steel ingots, then forge them into swords. Each sword must weigh nine catties and six maces, and be three feet and two inches long. It must be exact to the slightest fraction!"

Xu Yunfan naturally agreed readily. Having just been exposed to some new things, he was naturally enthusiastic. Moreover, to forge a weapon case that could conceal a divine weapon, he naturally needed to continuously level up his forging proficiency.
