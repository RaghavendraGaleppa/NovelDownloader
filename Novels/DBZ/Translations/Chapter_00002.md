# Chapter 2: The Life of a Tenant Farmer  

The passing maiden, though stunning, only received a brief glance from Wei Qian before he averted his gaze.  

He could sense the spiritual energy emanating from her—likely at the fourth level of Qi Refinement. Though she appeared younger than him, in the world of cultivation, where "age matters not, only attainment," he would have to address her as his senior.  

Such a girl was not on the same path as him, nor would their lives ever truly intersect.  

On the way to the fields where the Jade Crystal Rice was grown, Steward Fu Bo patiently explained the basic workings of the Li Clan of Misty Ridge Mountain to help Wei Qian adapt and integrate more quickly.  

The Li Clan, whose foundation lay in Misty Ridge Mountain, primarily earned spirit stones through two industries: cultivation and mining.  

Cultivation mainly involved growing spirit herbs, harvesting spirit tea, and planting spirit rice.  

The first two were highly valuable—a single spirit herb in the medicinal gardens could cost several spirit stones, equivalent to hundreds of pounds of spirit rice. Meanwhile, Misty Mountain Spirit Tea was a renowned variety, with just one tael fetching a spirit stone.  

The herb gardens and tea plantations were the Li Clan's "money trees," reserved only for their own kin.  

As for Wei Qian, his workplace would be the terraced fields on Misty Ridge Mountain, where he would toil diligently as a tenant farmer.  

Fu Bo called out from a distance, "Old Man Li, we have a new tenant farmer here. Come and greet him!"  

From afar, a figure rose from the fields—a dark-skinned man who looked like an ordinary mortal farmer.  

As he drew closer, Wei Qian realized that, compared to himself, this old man was actually a senior at the third level of Qi Refinement!  

Old Man Li sized Wei Qian up. "Young lad, have you ever worked as a tenant farmer before?"  

Wei Qian nodded in confirmation.  

"Good. Then demonstrate the 'Spring Breeze and Rain Art' for me."  

Under their watchful eyes, Wei Qian focused his mind, formed hand seals, and channeled wisps of spiritual energy from his dantian to stir the surrounding qi.  

In the next moment, the gathered spiritual energy transformed into tiny droplets that slowly descended from the sky.  

A light drizzle of spiritual rain fell over half an acre of land.  

Old Man Li frowned and glanced at Fu Bo.  

Fu Bo placated him, "Practice makes perfect. Be patient with him."  

With a long sigh, Old Man Li relented. "Fine, lad, you pass. From now on, you'll be responsible for casting 'Spring Breeze and Rain Art' from here all the way to the western edge of the fields. Water every plot thoroughly."  

"Yes," Wei Qian replied firmly.  

---  

Old Man Li and Wei Qian each took a side.  

Wei Qian's cultivation was still weak—after watering just over an acre of spirit rice, his spiritual energy would be completely depleted, forcing him to sit cross-legged and meditate to recover.  

Only after regaining his strength would he rise and continue his task.  

Compared to Wei Qian's exhaustive efforts, Old Man Li worked with far more ease. He strolled leisurely forward, and the spiritual rain followed in his wake.  

By the time he finished his side of the fields, Wei Qian had only completed a third of his own.  

Yet Wei Qian remained steady—casting the art, exhausting his energy, meditating, recovering, and repeating the cycle.  

Old Man Li observed all this and nodded in approval. "His cultivation is lacking, but his character is decent."  

As dusk approached and the sky darkened, Wei Qian still had one last stretch of land left unwatered.  

Old Man Li stood up and cast the Spring Breeze and Rain Art himself, helping Wei Qian finish the final plot.  

Wei Qian expressed his gratitude, and Old Man Li chuckled, accepting it without fuss.  

Before leaving, he patted Wei Qian's shoulder. "Go rest. From now on, you'll be dealing with these fields every day."  

With that, he pulled out a gourd of wine, took a swig, and hummed a tune as he walked away.  

"The family's temperament seems good. The people I've met so far aren't bad at all," Wei Qian mused, feeling he had made the right choice in coming to Misty Ridge Mountain.  

Wei Qian's residence was a small, single-room courtyard built halfway up the mountain.  

He didn't care much about the living conditions. The only thing that satisfied him was that this location was closer to the spiritual vein, making the ambient qi far denser than at the foot of the mountain.  

After eating and washing up, Wei Qian naturally sat cross-legged on his bed and began meditating.  

As the moon set and the sun rose, his first night on Misty Ridge Mountain passed peacefully.  

At dawn, Wei Qian opened his eyes, a faint smile on his lips.  

"I can feel the bottleneck for the first level of Qi Refinement. At this rate, I'll break through in less than ten days."  

Both his cultivation environment and spiritual root aptitude had improved compared to before—if he still couldn't advance, that would be truly strange.  

"And it's a new day again."  

His wish quota had refreshed!  

Wei Qian's consciousness immediately sank into his spiritual sea, arriving before the [Wish Dragon Pearl].  

This time, he didn't wish to improve his spiritual roots again.  

"Last time, raising my spiritual roots from low-grade to mid-grade took a thousand days. To go from mid-grade to high-grade would require even more."  

Wei Qian's golden finger had only awakened when he turned eighteen, granting him the ability to make wishes.  

But the wishes he could make were minor in nature.  

For more significant wishes, he would need to expend more wish quotas.  

For example, if he wanted to find a copper coin on the road, a single day's wish would suffice. But if he wanted to find a silver ingot, he would need to make the same wish for three consecutive days.  

Fortunately, when making a wish for the first time regarding something, Wei Qian would inexplicably know how many days of wishing were required to achieve it.  

If a wish demanded too many days, he could adjust his plans accordingly.  

Now, if he wasn't wishing to improve his spiritual roots, what should he wish for?  

Wei Qian had already made up his mind.  

"Dragon Pearl, I wish for my mastery of the 'Spring Breeze and Rain Art' to reach the Great Perfection realm."  

In the next moment, he sensed how many days this wish would require.  

Seven days!  

Withdrawing from his spiritual sea, Wei Qian stood up and stretched his limbs.  

Washing up, dressing, eating, then heading to the fields to work—returning to his residence to meditate and cultivate. Though his life was monotonous and repetitive, Wei Qian found joy in it.  

On the fifth day, he received "great" news—he had successfully broken through to the second level of Qi Refinement!  

Two more days passed. On the seventh day, after making his final wish, Wei Qian once again heard that ethereal, grand voice, as if echoing from beyond the heavens:  

"As you wish."  

Boom!  

A flood of insights surged into his mind, and suddenly, his understanding of the Spring Breeze and Rain Art deepened immeasurably.  

He quietly cast the art in his home, gathering spiritual energy into a dense cloud.  

In the next moment, an unbroken drizzle of spiritual rain began to fall.
