# Chapter 9: Everyone Hopes the Young Mistress Will Be Competent

Yang Can and Leopard Head rode their horses, leisurely trailing at the very end of the entire procession.

Yang Can’s movements as he rode were extremely graceful, his body rising and falling with the horse’s gait.

After all, he had spent two and a half years in the pasture, dealing with cattle and horses under the vast, open sky every day.

Now, he was not only an excellent horseman but also a skilled archer.

As they advanced, Yang Can’s gaze would occasionally fall on the carriage ridden by Tu Mama.

It was a subconscious action; his target was there.

Leopard Head was still resentful about not being able to interrogate the bandits and sneered:

“Master Yang, did you see that? The murderers of our Young Master, yet we aren’t even qualified to interrogate them. The Suo family is just too damn arrogant.”

Without waiting for Yang Can’s reply, he let out another cold snort and said dismissively, “But let them enjoy their moment of glory for now. Do they really think they can control us like this? Even if the Young Master were still alive, they wouldn’t be able to use the Young Mistress’s identity to interfere in the Yu family’s affairs. Now... haha, they can forget about it.”

“Forget it, don’t make pointless complaints in case someone with an agenda hears them,” Yang Can smiled and reminded him. “As long as we can give the Clan Lord an explanation, that’s enough.”

Hearing Yang Can’s words, Leopard Head fell silent. After a long while, he let out a long, melancholic sigh and said gloomily:

“Master Yang, you can certainly give the Clan Lord an explanation. You are the Young Master’s scholar, a civilian. The Young Master’s death has nothing to do with you. But I, Cheng... heh! Actually, I know in my heart...”

Leopard Head tilted his head back, his large beard pointing toward the sky, looking utterly dejected. “No matter how I try to make up for it, it will be hard to get a good result. The Clan Lord won’t blame the Suo family for the Young Master’s death, so... someone has to take the blame for this. Who else could that person be but me?”

Leopard Head gave a bitter smile. “Master Yang, I, Cheng, am not afraid of death. I’m just unwilling. Do you know? I’ve worked my ass off for the Yu family for almost thirty years, fighting and bleeding to get where I am today. My family is proud of me, my son looks up to me... I... I’m just not willing...”

Yang Can asked, “Old Cheng, do you think the Clan Lord will execute you because of the Young Master’s death?”

Leopard Head was stunned and hesitated. “That... it’s not necessarily so... When the Young Master was attacked, I was indeed too far away to help. The Clan Lord isn’t a violent man...”

Yang Can smiled slightly. “Then that settles it. The Clan Lord won’t execute you. As long as you’re alive, there’s still a chance.”

“Is there... still a chance?”

“There definitely is. Brother Cheng, your martial arts are exceptional, and the Clan Lord is currently short on capable men. Think about it, how could he give up on a great expert like you?” Yang Can comforted him gently. “There will be punishment, of course, but as long as you live, you will definitely have a chance to make a comeback.”

“Make a comeback...”

Hope gradually lit up in Leopard Head’s eyes.

This is how it is for people who are wandering helplessly; they urgently need recognition and comfort from others. Even a few words of consolation will be taken as a life-saving straw and magnified infinitely in their hearts.

Leopard Head said joyfully, “Master Yang is truly a scholar with great insight. Hey, I, Cheng, am just not steady enough, sorry to make you laugh. But, I’m not the only one in the main branch who is worried sick. Master Yang, do you think when we return to Tianshui, the main line of the main branch will be disbanded immediately? How will the Clan Lord arrange for us people of the main line of the main branch?”

Yang Can stroked his chin and pondered. “No, the Clan Lord will at least wait until he confirms whether our Young Mistress is pregnant or not.”

Leopard Head was first stunned, then suddenly slapped his forehead in realization. “That’s right! How could I forget about that? Yes, yes, yes, what if our Young Mistress is pregnant...”

He rubbed his hands excitedly, then started to worry again. “Master Yang, you said... our Young Mistress... she will be, right?”

“Look at the way you’re asking, how would I know?” Yang Can rolled his eyes at Leopard Head, but his gaze involuntarily drifted toward the four-horse carriage.

*I’ve worked so hard, surely it will happen, right?*

Tonight’s campsite was at the foot of a mountain.

Having learned the lesson from the previous attack, the camp was set with its back against a cliff, making the defense much tighter.

In early spring, the leeward, sunny side of the mountain was already turning green, unlike the desolate scenery seen along the way, because they were about to enter Tianshui.

Tianshui was located in the upper reaches of the Wei River, with a relatively humid climate. It was a rare fertile land in the Tianlong region, with fertile soil and a diligent farming population, truly the granary of Longyou.

At the foot of the mountain, the large tents had already been erected. Setting up and taking down such large tents required a lot of manpower and time.

But for a great clan, these things could not be skimped on. They had no shortage of manpower, and the pomp befitting a noble family could not be lost.

Inside the large tent, candlelight flickered on a bronze sparrow stand. Suo Chanzhi sat before her dressing table, her willow-like waist as if it could snap.

Having finished her bath, her beautiful hair was let down, already combed, shiny enough to reflect a person.

But she kept combing it, as if her hair was still a tangled mess, just like her chaotic mood.

Little Green Plum was originally in charge of combing her young mistress’s hair.

But for some reason tonight, the young mistress kept saying she wasn’t doing it well and snatched the ivory comb herself. Green Plum had to go make the bed.

The bedding was still a bright red, embroidered with mandarin ducks playing in the water.

It wasn’t that they didn’t want to change it; it was that among the many items brought by the Suo family as dowry, there wasn’t a single set of plain-colored bedding.

Green Plum smoothed the sheets over and over until there wasn’t a single crease left.

But thinking of the messy, twisted sheets she saw this morning, she felt her current actions were meaningless.

When they woke up tomorrow morning, this sheet would still be a mess, wouldn’t it?

*What exactly does that kind of thing feel like? Why does the young mistress always make such strange sounds?*

That “bottom of the chest” book was just a few disconnected pictures. For someone with no experience, even if she looked at it countless times, she could only be half-understanding. No wonder she couldn’t figure it out.

Yang Can walked over from the night and stopped outside the large tent, because Tu Mama was standing like a ghost in the shadows in front of the tent.

“Tu Mama.”

Yang Can greeted Tu Mama politely, looking as if he was three parts humble, three parts fearful, and four parts earnest.

This was very fitting for his current identity and the mood he should have.

Tu Mama didn’t see through his disguise. Seeing his appearance, she couldn’t help but be satisfied and tugged at the corner of her mouth. She extended a hand as thin as an old branch. “Take off your belt.”

Yang Can had a plain white belt tied at his waist. The conditions on the road were simple, so this served as mourning for the Young Master.

Tu Mama clearly didn’t want him wearing such an eye-catching thing inside, ruining Suo Chanzhi’s mood.

Yang Can quickly untied the plain belt and handed it to Tu Mama with both hands.

Tu Mama scanned the surroundings and tilted her head at Yang Can, then called out loudly, “Green Plum, come out.”

The sound entered the tent. The ivory comb in Suo Chanzhi’s hand suddenly paused. The little green plum sitting on the edge of the bed shot up like an arrow.

“Young Mistress...” Green Plum subconsciously called out to Suo Chanzhi.

Suo Chanzhi looked at the woman’s face in the mirror, which was gradually flushing red, and let out a barely audible hum from her nose.

Little Green Plum understood and walked toward the tent entrance.

Yang Can was just about to enter the tent when a girl as small and delicate as a fragrant fan pendant walked toward him.

They both moved left at the same time, then both moved right, dodging each other several times, only to perfectly end up facing each other again.

So, little Green Plum put her hands on her hips and glared angrily at Yang Can.

She hadn’t forgotten that there were many bruises on the young mistress’s body that were the work of this stinky man in front of her. The little girl felt a sense of righteous indignation!

Yang Can smiled slightly, took two steps back, and made way for her.

Only then did little Green Plum let out a soft snort, proudly raised her chin, and walked out with a “tap, tap, tap.”

Her little bottom was very perky, like a juicy peach. Although it was still a bit green, it hinted at its future sweetness.

Yang Can looked back. Tu Mama was already sitting by the edge of the tent wall.

That thin back looked just like a ridge beast crouching on a roof.

Yang Can walked into the tent and closed the tent flap.

Green Plum wanted to leave, but for some reason, she wanted to stay.

Hesitating for a moment, she still quietly walked over and, separated from Tu Mama by just the tent flap,自觉地 (consciously) squatted in the shadow of the large tent.

A meaningful, hard-to-fathom smile appeared on Tu Mama’s face again.

Inside the tent, Suo Chanzhi was still doing her makeup in the mirror, as if she didn’t know Yang Can had come in at all. Only when Yang Can’s figure appeared in the mirror did her body tremble slightly.

The tent suddenly fell into a strange silence. The sound of water dripping from the copper clepsydra at the corner of the tent became suddenly clear and audible. One drop, two drops, three drops...

Suo Chanzhi’s heartbeat also began to quicken. One beat, two beats, three beats...

On average, a drop from the clepsydra took about ten seconds. In this time, a person’s average heartbeat should be around fifteen beats.

But Suo Chanzhi felt her heartbeat had at least doubled in frequency. She could even hear her own heart pounding like a drum.

“How much longer are you going to comb your hair? It’s late,” Yang Can said, lying on the bed in a spread-eagle position, looking utterly lazy and deadbeat.

Suo Chanzhi saw this in the mirror and was instantly filled with rage. She slammed the ivory comb down on the dressing table.

“Surname Yang, you need to understand, your life and death are in my hands!”

Suo Chanzhi turned around on the silk stool, her willow eyebrows raised in anger.

She felt she had to set some rules for Yang Can!

*Why should you abuse me!*

*Why can you do whatever you want to me!*

*Why should I have to stay still when you tell me to, and lie down when you tell me to...*

“You... what are you going to do?”

The moment she saw Yang Can stand up, Suo Chanzhi panicked immediately.

She wanted to escape, but her butt seemed to be glued to the silk stool, and she couldn’t move at all.

Yang Can didn’t walk toward her. Instead, he walked leisurely to a three-legged,卷耳 (curled-ear) table by the bed and opened a small incense box.

After a brief selection, Yang Can chose a type of incense that calmed the nerves and had a faint, non-cloying scent.

He skillfully filled the incense burner with a silver spoon, then lit it with a candle flame. A faint, delicate fragrance quickly spread and drifted.

Then, he walked to Suo Chanzhi’s side and bent down slightly.

Suo Chanzhi felt her body go light as Yang Can lifted her into his arms again.

Suo Chanzhi was furious. She wanted to take the opportunity to slap Yang Can across the face. She wanted to knee him hard in the stomach. She wanted to sternly order Yang Can to kneel down...

After she finished thinking about it, she found herself flying through the air again and landing on the bed, bouncing a few times on the large mattress.

“You... you, you extinguish the lights first.”

Seeing Yang Can approach, Suo Chanzhi forgot about being angry. She felt that the rules could be set slowly; there had to be a process, after all.

Yang Can smiled and agreed, then turned to extinguish the lights in the tent one by one, but left one lit far from the bed.

Suo Chanzhi bit her lip, her voice as quiet as a mosquito’s buzz. “There’s still one light on.”

“Leave it,” Yang Can replied, and Suo Chanzhi didn’t say anything more.

*It’s okay, if he wants to leave it, let him. I asked him to extinguish the lights, and he listened, didn’t he?*

*This is a good start!*
