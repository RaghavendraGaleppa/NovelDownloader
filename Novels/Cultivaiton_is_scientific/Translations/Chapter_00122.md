# Chapter 122: Magical Artifact  

Among the Qi Refinement disciples in the sect recently, the Yun Family Trading House had become the most frequently mentioned name.  

It had been a month since Li Shiming began collaborating with the Yun Family Trading House. Every few days, the trading house would release a batch of "Thousand-Mile Viewers," always prioritizing their long-standing customers first.  

In just one short month, the Yun Family Trading House had established a sales network centered around the "Thousand-Mile Viewer."  

Unlike other trading houses, customers could now browse the Yun Family Trading House's products through the viewer, allowing them to visually inspect the details of the items.  

Coupled with the Yun Family Trading House's deliberate marketing, the "Thousand-Mile Viewer" became a more convenient, efficient, and confidential sales method compared to traditional approaches.  

The binding mechanism between the "Thousand-Mile Viewer" and identity jade tokens also gave the Yun Family Trading House a significant advantage over competitors.  

Every "Thousand-Mile Viewer" sold by the Yun Family Trading House required immediate binding to an identity jade token. This meant that even if other trading houses wanted to replicate the interactive sales network, they couldn't achieve the same results without access to the "Thousand-Mile Viewer."  

Over the years, the inner workings of each trading house had become common knowledge among competitors.  

Of course, other trading houses were also looking for solutions, but time was not on their side. Given the Yun Family Trading House's current growth rate, even if competitors obtained the "Thousand-Mile Viewer" later, they wouldn't be able to challenge its dominant position.  

Li Shiming had never imagined that the Yun Family Trading House would be so shrewd. The pricing of the "Thousand-Mile Viewer" left him astonished.  

Initially, he had considered setting the price below 100 spirit stones. Even after learning of the trading house's plans, he only adjusted it to a 30% profit share.  

He never expected the Yun Family Trading House to sell the "Thousand-Mile Viewer" for a staggering 500 spirit stones.  

Moreover, the trading house employed scarcity marketing tactics, effectively creating a commercial monopoly.  

In one month, Li Shiming had supplied Yun Ze with 500 "Thousand-Mile Viewers." He didn't want business matters to interfere with his cultivation, so producing 500 units per month was already his limit.  

In that single month, he was theoretically entitled to over 80,000 spirit stones in profits.  

Honestly, when he heard that number, he even considered robbing himself—it was an absurdly lucrative venture.  

Fortunately, only a handful of core members of the Yun Family Trading House knew about his profit share. According to Yun Ze, aside from the head of the Yun Family, only Yun Ze himself knew that Li Shiming was the provider of the "Thousand-Mile Viewer."  

Given the irreplicable nature of the "Thousand-Mile Viewer," the Yun Family Trading House had little reason to complain about paying out such a large sum of spirit stones.  

---  

The sales network built around the "Thousand-Mile Viewer" was far more valuable than the spirit stones spent.  

However, Li Shiming was well aware that holding onto such a fortune was risky. A mere fourth-level Qi Refinement cultivator—even with the status of a junior formation master—would inevitably attract covetous eyes sooner or later.  

Thus, he converted most of his profits into orders: expensive formation materials he had long desired but couldn't afford, as well as an item he had envisioned long ago but never had the means to realize.  

That morning, Yun Ze delivered a storage pouch to him.  

Using a storage pouch as packaging indicated that the contents were worth many times more than the pouch itself.  

Of course, given that Li Shiming was now a partner of the Yun Family Trading House, receiving a complimentary storage pouch wasn't unusual.  

Li Shiming accepted the pouch with excitement.  

"Junior Brother Li, while spirit stones come easily to you, you shouldn't spend them so recklessly!" Yun Ze couldn't help but advise, his tone tinged with concern.  

This wasn't something Yun Ze should have said—after all, the more Li Shiming purchased from the Yun Family Trading House, the more profit they made.  

But after working with Li Shiming for some time, Yun Ze had come to regard him as a friend.  

In his eyes, Li Shiming was a research fanatic, much like many formation masters in the sect, spending every spirit stone he earned.  

Li Shiming didn't explain the risks of hoarding too many spirit stones. While Yun Ze might not covet such wealth, other members of the Yun Family Trading House were another matter entirely.  

Li Shiming was like a child carrying gold through a bustling market—an easy target for greed.  

"Thank you for your concern, Senior Brother Yun. This is my dream!" Li Shiming replied with a smile.  

---  

Returning to the underground space, he found it vastly different from before. Rows of machines stood neatly arranged, separated by formations.  

Though the chips he manufactured were still only at the micrometer level, he had managed to produce one-micrometer chips after refining the silicon wafers. To create better chips, he would need to build a nanometer-scale lithography machine. For now, he needed more experience in wafer production to stabilize quality before proceeding further.  

The one-micrometer chips, combined with cooling formations and multi-chip coordination, allowed all equipment to operate autonomously without relying on the IBMz15.  

Industrial robotic arms also assisted, greatly reducing manual intervention.  

Thanks to the integration of arcane techniques from the cultivation world, these machines no longer suffered from wear and tear. As long as they had a steady power supply, they could operate indefinitely.  

However, Li Shiming had now hit a bottleneck in his research. The issue wasn't that the technology from his past life was inadequate—it was about integrating it with the cultivation world.  

Given his limited exposure to cultivation knowledge, reaching this point was already his current limit.  

But Li Shiming wasn't in a hurry. One of the greatest advantages of being a cultivator was longevity.  

Even a Qi Refinement cultivator could live well over a hundred years. He was confident he wouldn't remain at the Qi Refinement stage forever—he had plenty of time to continue his research.  

He walked to the spiritual spring in the underground space, where the area had been fully utilized.  

This was the outlet of the low-grade spiritual vein. The "Netherworld Ghost Formation" occupied part of the space near the spring, while the main formation core of the underground space was also placed there. Combined with the area reserved for his cultivation, every inch of space around the spring was now in use.  

Sitting on a stone stool, he retrieved the storage pouch Yun Ze had delivered and took out a pile of metal components.  

These components included long tubes and irregularly shaped pieces. The most astonishing part was that every single one was a mid-grade artifact blank—raw materials for mid-grade magical artifacts before enchantment.  

The pile of mid-grade blanks alone had cost him 10,000 spirit stones. No wonder Yun Ze had called it a waste.  

In this world, no one could understand Li Shiming's vision.  

His consciousness summoned the design blueprint stored in the IBMz15—a schematic for a six-barrel Gatling gun. Unlike a conventional design, this one was covered in formation runes and intricate spiritual energy circuits.  

These runes and circuits were so minute that they could only be seen under significant magnification. Such fine formations were exceedingly rare in the cultivation world—especially in the hands of a Qi Refinement cultivator.  

Li Shiming sent all the mid-grade blanks into his machine room space, where his consciousness entered his clone.  

The clone summoned a small portion of its third-grade sword foundation, transforming it into a micrometer-scale engraving tool.  

Under the combined control of his consciousness and the clone, the sword foundation-turned-engraving tool began meticulously carving formation bases onto the blanks according to the design.  

The process was incredibly precise—even the slightest error could affect the formation's effectiveness.  

Only within the machine room space, with the shape-shifting third-grade sword foundation, could such fine engraving be performed on mid-grade blanks.  

The creator of the "Sword Demon Secret Codex" would never have imagined that their powerful close-combat technique would one day be used for engraving.  

The engraving took five days, factoring in time for cultivation and rest.  

But this was only the first step. The next phase was equally intricate—melting or cutting formation materials to fill the engraved bases.  

This task took another two days. Setting up formations on mid-grade blanks was even more complex than setting up the small protective formation on Eagle Beak Island.  

After seven days of effort, Li Shiming held in his hands an object that should never have existed in this world—a Gatling gun.  

"A mid-grade magical artifact Gatling gun!" He gazed at the weapon excitedly.  

In his past life, every man had dreamed of wielding such firepower. As he had told Yun Ze, while not the sole reason, it was indeed his dream that drove him to spend spirit stones on what others saw as frivolities.  

Calling the Gatling gun a mid-grade magical artifact wasn't entirely accurate—every single component of it could be considered a mid-grade artifact.  

Of course, assembling multiple mid-grade artifacts wouldn't elevate its overall quality.  

After setting up the formations and enchantments, the mid-grade Gatling gun was complete. The next step was testing its power—the true measure of whether the 10,000 spirit stones had been well spent.  

If the Gatling gun failed to meet expectations, the investment would have been for nothing, leaving him with nothing more than an expensive toy.  

He took out eleven spirit stones—one placed at the rear formation base of the Gatling gun.  

As the formation activated, the surface of the gun shimmered with light before the intricate runes vanished into its interior.  

Li Shiming loaded the remaining ten spirit stones into the ammunition slot—these would power the weapon.  

Surveying his surroundings, he flashed out of the underground space and emerged above the sea outside the island.  

The underground space now had a new exit—a hidden underwater passage protected by formations and the island's defensive array.  

This was an escape route he had prepared for emergencies, allowing him to leave Eagle Beak Island undetected.  

Black wings unfurled from Li Shiming's back as he flew toward the distance.  

The sect's outer waters were dotted with uninhabited islands—small, barren places devoid of spiritual veins, fresh water, or food resources, not even frequented by seabirds.  

Li Shiming landed on one such island, where he would test the mid-grade Gatling gun.  

He pulled the trigger.  

The Gatling gun was primarily made of ice-attributed metal, enhanced with frost runes that allowed it to instantly form ice crystals.  

These crystals were precisely shaped into bullets within the chamber.  

Though the ice bullets, formed from mid-grade ice-attributed metal and frost runes, were only as durable as mid-grade artifacts, the Gatling gun's formations amplified their power.  

Spiritual energy drawn from the ammunition slot was injected into the bullets, a process accelerated by the intricate formations designed specifically for the weapon.  

The enhanced ice bullets now rivaled high-grade artifacts in strength—enough to threaten late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.  

But this was only the bullets' static state. Like a weapon held in hand, they wouldn't cause harm unless they struck a target.  

At this moment, the only fire-attributed metal component—the combustion chamber—ignited. A micro-formation channeled vast amounts of fire-attributed spiritual energy, creating a violent explosion inside.  

Since the Gatling gun's durability wasn't a concern—thanks to reinforcement runes, formations, and its mid-grade construction—the explosion was as powerful as possible.  

The ice bullet shot out of the barrel, its spin accelerated by rifling.  

Without needing to eject casings, a second bullet was formed and fired, followed by a third, a fourth, and so on.  

Though the description makes it sound lengthy, in reality, the Gatling gun fired thirty ice bullets per second.  

The rate of fire was controlled by an electric drive—a formation Li Shiming and the IBMz15 had developed together. The current maximum was thirty rounds per second.  

If future advancements in formations allowed, adjusting the electric drive could increase the Gatling gun's firing rate.  

At its current rate, the Gatling gun consumed one spirit stone every ten seconds. The ten loaded spirit stones would only last a hundred seconds.  

The ammunition slot could also be linked to a storage pouch for extended operation.  

After firing continuously for a hundred seconds, Li Shiming inspected the Gatling gun's condition.  

In his past life, synthetic metals could sustain a Gatling gun's fire. Now, with mid-grade artifacts and multiple enhancements, durability was even less of an issue.  

According to the IBMz15's calculations, each ice bullet packed the force of a bronze corpse swinging a great axe.  

How many Qi Refinement cultivators could withstand thirty such strikes in a single second?  

Perhaps a few. Li Shiming thought of Baili Jinyan—a top-tier young master whose strength was at the peak of Qi Refinement. Such a prodigy might withstand the Gatling gun's barrage with sheer resilience.  

But how many cultivators like Baili Jinyan existed in the world?  

Likely none, even in the Holy Ice Sect. The resources poured into Baili Jinyan—enough to nurture a Golden Core cultivator—explained his ability to resist the Gatling gun's assault. Such outliers were exceptions, not the norm.
