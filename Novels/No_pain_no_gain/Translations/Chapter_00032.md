**Chapter 32: This Kid Is Really Good at Pretending**

Han Zhen, of course, chose to read and not reply. For someone who harbored ill intentions towards him, Han Zhen wouldn't just refuse to give him face; if given the chance, he would definitely scheme against him. Daoist Qingwen waited for a long time outside without receiving any response. He shook his whisk, his face turning unsightly, and departed.

After leaving Han Zhen's loft, Daoist Qingwen went directly to a pavilion by the plaza. There, a pair of rogue cultivators who appeared to be intimate Daoist partners, a burly man in yellow, and a lean, cunning-looking man in his thirties were waiting for him. The average cultivation of these four was around Qi Condensation Stage Eight.

"Daoist Qingwen, where is that promising Talisman Master Han you mentioned?" asked the male cultivator of the rogue cultivator couple, whose cultivation was Qi Condensation Stage Nine, second only to Daoist Qingwen among the five.

"Hmph!" Daoist Qingwen snorted, displeased. "Talisman Master Han must have earned quite a few spirit stones lately, disdaining to associate with us rogue cultivators. Last time, he refused this humble Daoist's invitation, and this time, he wouldn't even open his door. Naturally, this humble Daoist wouldn't offer a warm face to a cold backside!"

Upon hearing Daoist Qingwen's words, the others were naturally greatly displeased with Han Zhen. The burly man in yellow even clamored, "It's fine if he doesn't come! That demonic beast isn't unkillable without him. One less person to share with, and we can all get a bit more benefit."

It turned out that Daoist Qingwen claimed that during his last outing, he had discovered the lair of a peak Tier 1 demonic beast. The beast was currently in its breeding period, and its strength had greatly decreased. However, he wasn't confident he could take down the beast without injury, so he had arranged to meet members of the Rogue Cultivator Alliance in the valley for a hunt. Unfortunately, most members of the Rogue Cultivator Alliance happened to be out preparing for the Tai Nan Small Gathering Trade Fair and had not yet returned. That was why he had invited the rogue cultivator couple. He also tried to persuade Han Zhen to join them, using the excuse that the spiritual fur on the demonic beast's chest was excellent material for refining talisman brushes.

As for why he targeted Han Zhen again, it was because during Daoist Qingwen's absence, the task of monitoring targets had been entrusted to two of his subordinates. One of them, the lean man, had unintentionally discovered that Han Zhen had purchased a large quantity of talisman crafting materials. Upon further inquiry, he found out that Han Zhen knew how to draw talismans. Over the past year, he had seen Han Zhen enter and exit Myriad Treasures Pavilion several times, leading him to surmise that Han Zhen must have quite a few spirit stones. He then reported this information to Daoist Qingwen. Qingwen had originally intended to lure Han Zhen out of Tai Nan Valley with false information about the demonic beast, promising him benefits, so he could enact his scheme. Unexpectedly, Han Zhen didn't give him any face; he waited outside for a long time, but couldn't even meet him.

Han Yunzhi collected the few remaining talismans on her stall into her small satchel, walking back while thinking about Brother Han. Without paying attention, she almost collided head-on with the five people emerging from the pavilion.

Han Yunzhi sensed the fluctuation of spiritual energy from the people in front of her. Her face instantly paled, and she couldn't help but shrink back in fear, retreating a few steps. The burly man in yellow, seeing the young girl's delicate and pitiful appearance, was about to flare up but was stopped by Daoist Qingwen, who shook his whisk.

"Young lady, please don't be afraid. We are all rogue cultivators; he just has a quick temper," Daoist Qingwen said with a benevolent smile, acting like a kind old man. Seeing this, the rogue cultivator couple's impression of the Rogue Cultivator Alliance greatly improved, thinking they would join them after this cooperation.

Han Yunzhi had long been instilled with caution by her brother and Han Zhen, who had repeatedly told her not to trust anyone lightly. Just as she was thinking about how to get away, a loud voice suddenly echoed from afar.

"Little sister!" A robust giant was sprinting towards them, his physique even larger than it had been a year ago. The four people behind Daoist Qingwen were startled by Han Yunfeng's imposing aura.

Just as Han Yunzhi was feeling a headache, she suddenly saw a savior. Even her brother's reckless demeanor seemed incredibly reliable at this moment. Han Yunfeng brought with him a gust of wind, rushing in front of Han Yunzhi. His Qi Condensation Stage Ten cultivation was displayed without reservation, and he looked at Daoist Qingwen and the other four with an unfriendly expression. A barely perceptible hint of greed flashed in Daoist Qingwen's eyes; this was simply excellent material for a blood sacrifice.

"Little sister, what happened? Who are these people?"

"Fellow Daoist, please don't misunderstand. I am Daoist Qingwen. Your esteemed sister merely almost bumped into us; the misunderstanding has just been resolved," Daoist Qingwen explained with a benevolent expression.

"Yes, yes, we are all rogue cultivators..." The man in yellow chimed in, about to speak of the benefits of the Rogue Cultivator Alliance, attempting to pull the Han siblings into their circle.

Unexpectedly, Han Yunfeng showed no interest whatsoever. With a wave of his large hand, he took the satchel from Han Yunzhi, interrupting the man in yellow's words. "Then I apologize on behalf of my little sister. If there's nothing else, we'll take our leave."

"Since Fellow Daoist has no interest, Qingwen won't force it," Daoist Qingwen sighed, his tone slightly regretful. He then shook his head and led the four away in the direction of the valley exit.

It wasn't until the five had walked far away that Han Yunfeng spoke with disdain, "Not cultivating properly, but instead busy forming factions all day—what kind of good people can they be!" Han Yunzhi was greatly relieved. Her brother had not only increased his cultivation after his retreat but had also grown a brain; he had finally learned to speak ill of people behind their backs. Han Yunfeng then began to chat with his sister about the events of the past year. "Little sister, I apologize; you've had a tough year."

***

Fighting was prohibited in the valley, but with her gentle nature, his little sister must have encountered many difficulties like the one just now.

"It's alright. Brother Han has taken good care of me this past year. I rarely encountered such incidents when I set up my stall." Han Yunzhi then recounted how Han Zhen had taken good care of her over the past year, and how she had helped him sell talismans.

However, hearing all this, Han Yunfeng felt that the problem was much bigger. When it came to matters concerning his sister, he became significantly more astute. It seemed that this kid's initial honest appearance was all a pretense! While he was in seclusion this past year, he had actually taken advantage of the situation! His little sister talked about Brother Han much more than she talked about herself.

"Heh heh, 'come out of seclusion and have tea together,' huh!" Han Yunfeng sneered inwardly.

"Little sister, how about we take this opportunity to go find your Brother Han for tea?" Han Yunfeng said, carefully observing Han Yunzhi's expression. Sure enough, her cheeks flushed slightly, looking a bit shy, which further confirmed Han Yunfeng's suspicions. Before this notion became too deeply ingrained, it had to be severed decisively. He hoped Han Zhen would be sensible. No matter how much the Han family had declined, their ancestors had at least been prosperous once. His little sister could absolutely not get involved with such a rogue cultivator. Han Yunfeng sighed inwardly; it seemed he had to be the villain.

So, led by Han Yunzhi, the two made their way to Han Zhen's loft. Han Yunzhi skillfully activated a Sound Transmission Talisman, sending it flying inside. Han Zhen initially thought it was Daoist Qingwen, still unwilling to give up, but then he heard the clear voice of a young girl from within the talisman.
