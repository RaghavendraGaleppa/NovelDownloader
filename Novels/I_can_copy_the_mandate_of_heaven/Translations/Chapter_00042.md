The passage of only a night had created a distinct chasm between life and death.

As dawn broke, the medicine valley bustled with activity. The Sect Leader dispatched personnel, including undertakers responsible for handling Doctor Mo’s funeral arrangements. Several figures clad in black mourning robes entered, bowing three times with mournful expressions before Doctor Mo's body. One of them stepped forward, smoothing Doctor Mo’s eyelids shut, ensuring their complete closure. They then covered the body with a white sheet.

“Little Doctor Li, Child Han, please change into these clothes,” a figure in black mourning attire said, approaching Li Zhiming and Han Li, offering them two sets of coarsely woven hemp clothing. These were “mourning garments,” made from the roughest, raw hemp cloth, crudely cut.

Being men, Li Zhiming and Han Li immediately removed their outer garments and donned the mourning clothes. They were then fitted with hemp waistbands and headbands made of sturdy female hemp.

It wasn't yet time for wailing or memorial services; they were merely setting up the mourning hall. Li Zhiming and Han Li watched as the figures busied themselves. In their lives, neither had ever witnessed a death so closely.

An older uncle led Li Zhiming and Han Li away to rest. A pot was set up in the valley, and some yellow millet porridge was cooked, but Li Zhiming couldn't bring himself to eat. Even with a warm bun in his hand, he couldn't take a bite.

He watched the figures in black mourning robes working inside the hall. They dismantled the bed, replaced it with wooden planks, and carefully lifted Doctor Mo's body onto the planks. Then, they erected a black cloth embroidered with a large character for "Memorial," obscuring their work.

Next, they would cleanse Doctor Mo's face, shave his head and face, and wipe his body before dressing him in his burial clothes.

As the sun grew hotter, the number of visitors gradually increased.

Han Li and Li Zhiming were placed at the innermost part of the mourning hall, kneeling on either side of the coffin, wailing. Visitors would first offer incense, then cry out a few times before kneeling and kowtowing, a ritual that Li Zhiming and Han Li were expected to follow.

Throughout the process, He Guangping kept a watchful eye.

“If Little Doctor Li seems overwhelmed, immediately take him to the back to rest,” he whispered. “Don't let Little Doctor Li get too exhausted.”

“I understand,” the person beside him nodded, his gaze fixed on the Little Divine Doctor.

With the wailing for Doctor Mo beginning, the entire Seven Mysteries Sect seemed to be in a flurry. Doctor Mo's virtuous reputation was well-known while he was alive, and his passing brought an unusually large number of mourners. People Li Zhiming had never seen before – the upper echelons of the Seven Mysteries Sect and the masters of the nine peaks – all came!

Not only did they come, but before leaving, they made a point of shaking Li Zhiming’s hand, and even left someone behind to look after him.

At noon, Sect Leader Meng Weizhi arrived. He knelt before Doctor Mo’s coffin, weeping loudly three times before kowtowing three times.

Li Zhiming watched these important figures pay their respects to the deceased Doctor Mo.

Curled up on the side, Li Zhiming quickly ran out of tears, but his heart felt even emptier. Before coming to the Seven Mysteries Sect, he felt completely alone, but after arriving, Doctor Mo had become his support.

Doctor Mo's passing was a devastating blow to Li Zhiming.

Having managed to drink some millet porridge at noon, Li Zhiming was carried away by an adult and slept soundly for half an hour. In the afternoon, the number of people coming to pay their respects increased further. This was only the first day of the vigil.

It would be seven days before everything was cleared away and Doctor Mo was buried. Only then would the funeral finally end.

Inside the main hall of the ‘Wind’ character division, Gao Changdong, who had visited Doctor Mo earlier in the afternoon, was drinking tea. Before him stood several stewards dressed in blue silk robes and white-edged socks. Their clever faces showed carefully cultivated expressions of anxiety.

“Our Seven Mysteries Sect needs to select some clever maids.”

“May I ask what requirements the master has?” one of them asked skillfully, clearly a seasoned veteran.

“Our requirements this time are very high. Of course, the rewards for you will be substantial. To be frank, this matter was personally instructed by our Sect Leader. There can be no carelessness. You must rouse your spirits!”

“If you botch this matter for me,” Gao Changdong said menacingly, “it seems your business isn't doing so well. From now on, you need not work under my Seven Mysteries Sect!”

“How dare we!” Hearing such serious words, the stewards immediately fell to their knees, foreheads dripping with oily sweat. They had assumed it was a simple task of selecting maids, but who would have thought there would be such complications?

Seeing their reaction, and knowing they understood the seriousness of the matter, Gao Changdong took a deep breath and said slowly.

Did they really think he, as a Hall Master, had nothing better to do? Neglecting the mourning of Doctor Mo, neglecting the affairs of the ‘Wind’ character division, just to waste time here with them? Nonsense! This matter could not be taken lightly; he needed to handle it personally.

“First of all, these maids must have completely clean backgrounds and be of presentable appearance.”

Hearing this, the steward immediately understood, a smile appearing on his face. It seemed some master had developed certain inclinations. This was easy. He asked, "May I ask what specific requirements the master has? What age?"

“Hmph.” Gao Changdong saw through his bad intentions with a single glance, slammed the table, and rebuked, “Don't think wildly. The master they will serve is only twelve years old. Their appearance must naturally be presentable, and the age…choose seventeen-year-olds.”

“Listen carefully,” Gao Changdong paused, then said slowly, “The chosen people will naturally serve him, be diligent in their work, capable of handling any trivial matter, but also know how to be charming, be knowledgeable and understanding, and know how to care for others.”

“But, even more importantly, they must absolutely abide by the rules.”

“Moreover, their backgrounds must not be too ordinary!”

??

Faced with such strange requirements, the people below exchanged glances. Selecting maids meant either choosing those who were clever and capable, or those who were truly for "serving" others, in which case, being able to take care of people didn't matter, as long as they were of presentable appearance and beautiful figure.

Yet Gao Changdong wanted both, while also requiring them to abide by the rules!

What was the point of choosing a beautiful maid with a presentable appearance if she had to abide by the rules?

But these people were astute. After a moment of contemplation, they understood Gao Changdong’s requirements.

He was painstakingly selecting a virtuous child bride!

Not choosing a simple serving maid, nor choosing a wanton and shameless harlot!

If that was the case, then these requirements were truly too high!

That's right, Meng Weizhi was thinking far ahead. Little Doctor Li was still young and ignorant, but there would always be a time when he matured and developed a taste for such things. Choosing such a considerate and virtuous person to serve him from a young age would naturally lead to a deeper connection by the time he reached adulthood.

With everything falling into place so naturally, how could they fail to secure his heart?

It could only be said that these superiors truly thought on a grand scale.
