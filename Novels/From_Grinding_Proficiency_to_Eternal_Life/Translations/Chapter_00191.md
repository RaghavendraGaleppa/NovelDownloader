# Chapter 191: Low-Grade Sharp Blade

The next morning, Xu Yunfan woke up as usual and opened his mechanism box to take a sip of the Ginseng Doll’s vital essence. Ignoring the doll’s snarling face, Xu Yunfan took a deep breath and drew a wisp of the ginseng qi deep into his lungs.

After circulating it through his lungs, it quickly dispersed throughout his limbs and body.

Without the slightest hesitation, Xu Yunfan immediately assumed the Pure Yang Stance of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique in the courtyard. He began to draw out the hidden Pure Yang internal qi stored within his flesh and blood, forming a small, continuous cycle between his torso and arms.

He had been thoroughly trounced by that woman in white yesterday. Since entering the ‘Lin’ state for the third time, Xu Yunfan had done everything he could to get close to her.

The fourth time, he grabbed her wrist; the seventh time, her ankle; the tenth time, her thigh.

Watching the woman in plain clothes go from an expressionless face to being flustered and angry in succession, he felt a wave of satisfaction in his heart.

At this moment, the Pure Yang internal qi within him surged like a babbling brook, constantly flowing through his muscles, skin, membranes, and flesh. With every circulation, the blood and energy in his body rose and fell like the tide.

When the internal qi first moved, it felt like ten thousand ants gnawing at his bones. A fine tremor spread from the depths of his marrow, and the scorching torrent flowing through the crevices of his muscles gave him a sensation almost as pleasant as soaking in a hot spring.

As the morning light pierced the thin mist, Xu Yunfan’s back muscles suddenly began to tremble violently. Seven dark red ridges rose up from the Dazhui acupoint at the back of his neck, twisting like living snakes down his spine before sinking three inches into his waist.

The trapezius muscles, forged by years of swinging hammers, were now as taut as an anvil. Twelve tendons wove a dark golden net beneath his skin, locking away enough force to overturn an ox cart within the layers of his fascia.

The essence of the Thousand-Jun Hammer Method lay in the interlocking connection between the scapula and the rib cage. When the right arm swung the hammer, the left latissimus dorsi had to be as taut as a bowstring. The instant the hammer head smashed down, the rhomboid muscles would suddenly expand like the wings of a hawk spreading.

If one were to cut open his bronze-colored skin now, they would see the elastic fibers buried deep in the core of his back coiled in a unique spiral. This was the transformation of muscle, bone, and skin reaching perfection. On the verge of the External Three Unions realm reaching great completion, his muscles were slowly changing toward the optimal method of generating force for the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method.

When practicing the hammer method, Xu Yunfan’s starting stance was extremely slow. As the hammer edge cut through the air, it actually produced a fine buzzing sound. When the third move, the Stacked Waves Shatter Mountain, was about to be unleashed but had not yet fully formed, the back muscles suddenly erupted with a sound like leather tearing. The iron hammer’s falling momentum increased threefold instantly, yet it stopped hovering half an inch above the bluestone slab.

The core of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method’s force generation lay in the back muscles. The wisps of strength nurtured within also lay dormant there. With just a movement of qi and blood, it could be unleashed in an instant, displaying power capable of shattering stone and cracking the sky.

After breakfast, Xu Yunfan swung the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, slowly practicing the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer move by move.

After finishing his training and washing off the sweat, Xu Yunfan shouldered his gear and carried a forged steel hammer to the Geocentric Fire Room of the Casting Hall, preparing to start today’s forging.

The Heavenly Work Forging Technique was on the verge of reaching minor completion, and he was about to forge a weapon of the Sharp Blade level. He naturally took it to heart.

Today, he was forging a piece of Northern Sea Cold Iron. It had been quenched in an ice spring nine times last night and was now covered in frost patterns.

When the iron blank in the furnace turned cherry red, he suddenly gripped the hammer handle in reverse and stabbed the tungsten steel cone at its tail into the iron block. This was the ‘Bone-Penetrating Needle’ technique recorded in the Heavenly Work Forging Technique, capable of creating stress fractures inside the metal.

After eight hundred strikes, the surface of the iron block was cracked like a dried-up riverbed, yet it maintained its complete form.

When the geocentric fire turned blue-white, the heavy hammer finally descended with the sound of wind and thunder. The flying sparks left beautiful cloud patterns on the glazed windows.

At the three-quarter hour of the Shen period (around 4:45 PM), a dragon’s cry sounded from the white mist rising from the quenching pool. A straight blade three feet and seven inches long slowly took shape in the nitrate water. The blade pattern actually resembled stacked waves, proving that there wasn't a single misplaced strike among the four hundred and seventy folds of forging.

Xu Yunfan flicked the blade with his fingers. The residual vibration traveled from his fingers into his bones, making his bones subconsciously emit a cicada-like tremor. The blade itself emitted a sound similar to the ringing of a bell or chime, resonating with it.

The blade reflected the beads of sweat at his eyebrows and the look of joy on his face.

A low-grade sharp blade had been forged by him today.

*‘You practiced the Heavenly Work Forging Technique without pause every day and successfully forged a weapon of the Low-Grade Sharp Blade level. Your proficiency in the Heavenly Work Forging Technique has increased significantly.’*

"Good. I didn't expect that in just half a year, you would be able to forge a weapon of the Sharp Blade level. This is enough to show that your talent for forging is astonishing."

Fu Jin’s voice came from the side, making Xu Yunfan grin involuntarily. He turned his head and said, "Senior Brother, why do you have time to come over today?"

Only now did he see the indescribable sense of melancholy on Fu Jin’s face.

Indeed, Fu Jin grew up on the Divine Weapon Ridge and has been in contact with forging techniques for over forty years. It took him fifteen years from the moment he formally started forging to create his first sharp blade weapon.

That night, he had a sudden inspiration, his hammer strikes seemed divinely guided, and he finally broke through the shackles of his skill, successfully forging his first sharp blade.

But compared to Xu Yunfan before him, who successfully forged a low-grade sharp blade in just half a year... it was simply inhuman.

The embers of the forge had not yet cooled, and green smoke curled up the ice-cracked patterns on the blade. Fu Jin walked up and ran his fingers over the edge. The old calluses and the new cold iron rubbed together, producing a fine, coppery sound.

"The ice cracks are three millimeters deep but haven't penetrated the spine. The Nine-Forging Method mixed with the Stacked Waves force of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method." Fu Jin’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed a sigh. His knuckles tapped the blade, producing three long and two short clear rings. "Four hundred and seventy folds? No... there's a Mother-Child Tempering Pattern hidden in this tremor."

Xu Yunfan naturally knew what Fu Jin was counting.

When the geocentric fire was about to die out, he had used the Twin-Anvil Collision method from the Heavenly Work Forging Technique. Two pieces of Northern Sea Black Ice were placed on either side of the iron anvil. Every time he completed nine folds of forging, he would rapidly cool and quench it. That is how he squeezed out fifty extra layers of steel patterns on top of the standard four hundred and twenty folds.

Fu Jin suddenly lifted the leather wrist guard on his left arm, revealing three centipede-like burn marks. He then looked at Xu Yunfan’s hands, which were as white and smooth as jade, without a single callus to be seen, and felt a genuine ache in his heart.

Skin training perfected, old skin shed, new skin generated, and able to maintain his skin in its best state at all times, yet as tough as tough cowhide and difficult to cut. Furthermore, he practiced the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method and had the True Body Training technique, the Hundred-Forged Steel Body, to protect him.

Ordinary mortal weapons could not harm him in the slightest.

Although his hands were reinforced by the Hundred-Forged Steel Body, their roughness was completely unnoticeable.

"I was thirty-five years old that year, seeking a breakthrough in my skills. I forced myself to forge five hundred folds of Dragon Scale Steel and left these behind." He rubbed the deepest scar with his fingertips, but his eyes stared fixedly at the straight blade in his hand, which had been forged by Xu Yunfan.

"The cold iron you used was mined three years ago?"

"It's a new ore from last year's Frost's Descent." Xu Yunfan said, "Soaked in the ice spring for seven days and nights, changing the water nine times every hour."

Naturally, he didn't do these things himself. Since the Heavenly Work Cave opened its gates widely, accepting only disciples under the age of fifteen, the entire Shu Prefecture naturally knew of the Heavenly Work Cave as this great forging sect. Such tasks were naturally handled by the laborer disciples.
