# Chapter 61: Spirit God Liquid

Time passed.

The atmosphere grew increasingly lively.

On one of the rooftops:

"This should be the third time, if I remember correctly?" a young man in black asked quietly.

"You're wrong—it's the fourth. There was one before you arrived," replied the elderly man beside him, his gaze fixed unwaveringly on the Hidden Fragrance Pavilion.

"How I wish I could go inside and take a look."

"The treasures those senior disciples from the Dao Academy have... tsk tsk!"

"Hah, what's the point of looking? Could you even afford any of them?" a woman sneered.

"At least it would broaden my horizons."

"Look—" the woman suddenly exclaimed excitedly, pointing at a graceful figure appearing at the entrance of the Hidden Fragrance Pavilion. "It's Fairy Shen! She once saved my life."

"Who's Fairy Shen?" the young man asked curiously.

"You don't even know Fairy Shen? Haven't you been to the battlefield to hunt demons recently? She's a true prodigy of the Dao Academy," the woman said disdainfully.

The young man fell silent. Indeed, he hadn't been to the battlefield these past few days. He had spent the first ten days recuperating, and the remaining time hustling to trade demon cores, making a considerable profit in cultivation resources.

Not long after, another figure slowly entered the Hidden Fragrance Pavilion.

Seeing someone around Fairy Shen's age entering as well, the woman couldn't help but grumble, "Who's that? Why does he get to enter like Fairy Shen? His aura seems much weaker than hers."

"Could that be the legendary Chen Xiandao, who's said to be on par with Fairy Shen?" the old man guessed.

"No! When Fairy Shen saved me, Senior Brother Chen was there too. I'd definitely recognize him. This guy is much weaker than Senior Brother Chen."

"Then who is he?" The old man scratched his head in confusion.

"Logically speaking, those who can enter aren't nobodies. Especially those with noticeably weaker cultivation—their reputations should be even greater, like Fairy Shen and Senior Brother Chen."

At that moment, the young man in black puffed out his chest, eager to regain face, a smug expression on his face. "You don't even know the Plague God? Haven't been back to the market recently?"

As soon as he spoke—

"He's the Plague God?!" the old man and the woman exclaimed in unison, their faces instantly filled with awe.

The moniker "Plague God" had been the talk of the market—how could they not know? This was just their first time seeing him in person.

In fact, they owed him thanks.

If not for the Plague God, they wouldn't have been able to exchange for the cheap low-grade talismans available now.

"I never imagined the Plague God would be so young. I always thought..." The woman's gaze softened as she gently cupped her cheeks, as if to hide the blush rising to her face. "He's so handsome!"

"The Dragon Lake Dao Academy truly lives up to its reputation as the dream destination for us wandering cultivators of Nanli. It's brimming with prodigies," the old man mused, his eyes filled with complex emotions.

Not far from them, four figures in green robes stood quietly beneath a tree, their eyes also fixed on the Hidden Fragrance Pavilion.

The murmurs of the surrounding crowd drifted into their ears.

One by one, expressions of shock appeared on their faces.

After a long while—

"Haaa..." Tong Yao let out a long exhale, the astonishment on her face gradually fading. "I never imagined Junior Brother Zhang would be the 'Plague God.' Senior Brother Yangchu would never believe that in just a few months, Junior Brother Zhang has grown to such heights."

Beside her, Senior Brother Ding's eyes were equally unsettled. Since Zhang Jing hadn't concealed his spiritual fluctuations, he could faintly sense it—Junior Brother Zhang had actually broken through to the fourth level of Qi Refinement?!

Coming to his senses, Senior Brother Ding glanced at Tong Yao, Junior Brother Zhou, and Junior Brother Xia beside him. After some thought, he decided not to tell them for now, lest it affect their state of mind.

Meanwhile, inside the Hidden Fragrance Pavilion—

Under the guidance of an attendant, Zhang Jing slowly made his way to the second-floor hall.

Rows of seats had already been arranged inside.

The floor was covered with an exquisite carpet of unknown material, so soft underfoot it felt like cotton, yet firm enough to support movement without hindrance.

The room was adorned with colored glass lanterns, silk tassels, and embroidered sachets. Despite efforts to keep the decor elegant, an air of extravagance was unmistakable.

Zhang Jing's expression remained calm, though inwardly he couldn't help but marvel.

He had heard of the Hidden Fragrance Pavilion's reputation back in Yong'an City. He just never expected to enter it in such a capacity today.

"Esteemed Immortal, I can only take you this far," the attendant said respectfully, stopping at the edge of the hall.

"Thank you," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.

As the attendant retreated, Zhang Jing scanned the room.

There weren't many seats—only thirteen rows with nine seats each, totaling one hundred and seventeen. Compared to the number of Dao Academy disciples who had come to Langya County, this was a paltry few.

It seemed Senior Brother He hadn't been exaggerating yesterday.

Many of the seats were already occupied.

After surveying the room, Zhang Jing chose one in the second-to-last row and sat down.

Since it was his first time, he figured it'd be best to observe from the back.

Shortly after sitting, he felt two gazes from the front row settle on him.

Following them, he met the eyes of Senior Brother He and a familiar face beside him—Shen Qingqing.

Zhang Jing nodded in greeting, and the two returned the gesture with smiles.

Gradually, more people arrived.

On the raised platform at the front, a figure clad in white robes suddenly appeared—a senior sister with striking features, a hint of cool elegance in her brows, and a beauty mark beneath her eye that drew attention. Her loose robes couldn't conceal her graceful figure.

"Late-stage Qi Refinement! At least the ninth level!" Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened.

"We won't wait for the few junior brothers and sisters who haven't arrived yet," she announced. "I am Liu Nanshu. Most of you already know me. For the newcomers, I welcome you on behalf of all the senior brothers and sisters."

"The fourth internal trading session begins now."

"First phase: auctioning the treasures entrusted by everyone beforehand."

With a flick of her sleeve, a white jade vial appeared on the table before her.

"First item: High-grade Water Essence Pill. Starting bid—200 Dao merits."

"210 Dao merits!"

"215 Dao merits!"

From his seat, Zhang Jing reluctantly withdrew his gaze and leaned back into the plush cushion, showing no intention of participating.

It wasn't that he looked down on the items.

Frankly, he coveted that Water Essence Pill.

But his Dao merits were simply insufficient.

All he could do was watch longingly.

He had plenty of demon cores, and they were quite valuable.

Unfortunately, as Senior Sister Liu had explained, the first phase only accepted Dao merits.

Zhang Jing couldn't help but glance at the senior brothers and sisters around him.

Hundreds, even thousands of Dao merits tossed around casually—these people were truly wealthy!

It was as the saying went: the poor starve while the rich drown.

For now, he could only pin his hopes on the second phase, where his purified demon cores and talismans might fetch something good.

Time flowed steadily.

The auction continued, nearing its end.

"Yellow Dragon Whip—an earth-attribute high-grade magical artifact of exceptional quality. Starting bid: 250 Dao merits."

The announcement snapped Zhang Jing's attention forward, his eyes locking onto the heavy aura emanating from the whip on the platform.

If he fused this treasure into his Five Treasures Spirit River, how powerful would it become?

What if all five artifacts were high-grade?

With the Five Treasures Spirit River's ability to appear and vanish at will, slaying a White Deer that hadn't fully reached late-stage Qi Refinement would be child's play.

But the next moment, the exorbitant price shattered his fantasy.

Over 400 Dao merits for one item? He'd have to make do with five mid-grade artifacts for now.

He couldn't afford it yet.

"Final item: Five qian of Spirit God Liquid. Aids in concentration and spirit gathering, significantly improving success rates in talisman-making and pill-refining, as well as cultivation efficiency. Starting bid: 400 Dao merits."

As Liu Nanshu spoke, she slowly uncorked the jade vial.

A strange, intoxicating fragrance instantly filled the air.

The room fell silent.

Spirit God Liquid, obtained from demons, was exceedingly rare and precious. Its effects were even more remarkable than what Senior Sister Liu described.

This was something high-level cultivators sought diligently, saving it for future breakthroughs.

Using it for talismans or pills would be a sheer waste.

Yet why would someone sell such a treasure?

Most of those present briefly wondered but quickly dismissed the thought.

The item was right there—why overthink it?

The bidding frenzy began.

"500 Dao merits!"

"530 Dao merits!"

From his seat, Zhang Jing unconsciously leaned forward, his eyes fixed ahead as he inhaled the peculiar fragrance.

It smelled familiar.

He might have some of this!

Holding his breath, he extended his spiritual sense into his storage space, meticulously searching.

Finally, near a crimson millstone, he found two jade vials.

After repeated confirmations, he was certain—one of them contained Spirit God Liquid, and a full liang at that!

"700 Dao merits!"

"750 Dao merits!"

The shouting in the hall showed no signs of stopping.

Thump! Thump!

With each escalating bid, Zhang Jing felt his heart leap into his throat.

"1,100 Dao merits!"

When a senior brother in the front row called out this price, no one countered.

The auction for Spirit God Liquid was settled.

2,200 Dao merits!

Zhang Jing tightly gripped the crystalline jade vial in his hand.

The Spirit God Liquid's effects paled in comparison to his Mind's Eye Seed and Crimson Spirit Light.

He had no use for it.

But he could sell it.
