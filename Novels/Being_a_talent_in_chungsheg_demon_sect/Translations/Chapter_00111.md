# Chapter 111: The Sacred Sect that Attracts Hatred

Jiangdong, Jiangxi, Jiangbei.

Three Golden Core True Monarchs simultaneously manifested their Dharma Bodies, stabilizing the ley lines and plucking stars with a single hand. Such a vast and magnificent scene left Lu Yang stunned for a long time.

"This is a Path-Seizing War."

"However, the scale of this Path-Seizing War is not large; only Qi Refining disciples are needed to act. In true grand battles, True Masters also personally participate."

"And you're lucky; that group of sword-wielding fanatics from Jiangnan didn't come."

Beside him, True Master Chongguang also sighed deeply before explaining, "This star is actually a Heavenly Realm drifting beyond the sky."

"Every once in a while, a Heavenly Realm will approach from beyond the sky. At that time, the True Monarchs will act, capturing these Heavenly Realms that would otherwise merely brush past us. They then refine them, initiating a Path-Seizing War, and we are then responsible for entering them to seize that Heavenly Realm for the True Monarchs."

"Whoever wins, the Heavenly Realm belongs to them."

"The winning True Monarch can also use the 'Heavenly Realm' as a 'piece' to nail it into any defeated party's territory, expanding the influence of their Karma Fruit."

"The Heavenly Realm will then transform into a wonder."

Speaking of this, True Master Chongguang seemed to recall something and chuckled:

"For example, that Mass Grave in Jiangnan was won by True Master Yinshan in the past. It was originally also a Heavenly Realm, and the great shamans within it had some remarkable abilities."

"Unfortunately, those great shamans were stubborn. After True Master Yinshan and his allies won, the True Monarchs couldn't be bothered to waste time, so they directly slaughtered all of them, burying them alive, and then cast the Heavenly Realm into the Jiangnan territory. That's how the Mass Grave came to be, and it now serves as a bridgehead for the standoff between our Sacred Sect and the Sword Pavilion."

Lu Yang listened, utterly captivated.

True Master Chongguang had explained it to this extent; how could Lu Yang not understand? The so-called Heavenly Realms were clearly small worlds, similar to Law Refining Secret Realms!

"I thought only Dao Lords, such powerful beings, could control small realms," Lu Yang couldn't help but exclaim.

"Dao Lords, ah..."

True Master Chongguang shook his head. "You mean Law Refining Secret Realms, right? Those are different. Law Refining Secret Realms are created by Dao Lords, not captured."

Capturing Heavenly Realms, creating Heavenly Realms.

The difference between the two was perhaps precisely the gap between a Golden Core True Monarch and a Nascent Soul Dao Lord. Lu Yang took a deep breath, quickly clearing his mind of extraneous thoughts.

Overthinking was useless; the main business was important.

Lu Yang's expression turned serious, and he spoke again, "Martial Uncle, so, does this Heavenly Realm also contain some aboriginals with divine abilities?"

True Master Chongguang nodded. "That's also something you'll have to deal with. Some natives are not to be trifled with, especially when the Heavenly Realm is captured by True Monarchs and senses its own impending destruction. It will instinctively support the natives within it, and the Sons of Destiny nurtured this way are not easy to deal with."

"However, defeating them is also one of the conditions for victory."

As he finished speaking, True Master Chongguang lightly tapped his hand, producing a scroll. Within the scroll, mountains encircled a clear stream cascading down from a mountaintop.

"This item is called the 'Abyssal Still Meeting Scroll,' and it is the Karma Fruit Treasure of our Sacred Sect's True Monarch Pure Snow for this occasion."

"On the other side, the True Monarchs of the Jiangdong Dao Court and Jiangxi Pure Land will also each implant one of their Karma Fruit Treasures into the Heavenly Realm, serving as the standard for judgment."

"What you need to do is destroy the opposing party's Karma Fruit Treasure."

"Or, defeat the Son of Destiny within the Heavenly Realm, seize the Heavenly Realm's 'Heavenly Count,' and then integrate it into the Karma Fruit Treasure. Achieving either of these counts as a victory."

Having finished, True Master Chongguang handed the scroll to Lu Yang.

"Generally, this item is only given to the strongest participant in a Path-Seizing War. Take it; how to use it and how to achieve victory is entirely up to your discretion."

"Furthermore, this item itself is a marvelous magical treasure. Once unfurled, it can manifest a landscape of mountains and rivers, serving as a fortress against external enemies. Any non-Sacred Sect disciple who enters the diagram will immediately have their cultivation weakened by thirty percent, while our Sacred Sect disciples fighting within the diagram will have the power of their divine abilities enhanced by seventy percent."

Lu Yang took the "Abyssal Still Meeting Scroll" and carefully put it away.

A moment later, the star captured by the three True Monarchs suddenly burst forth with brilliant light. Immediately, Lu Yang's disciple token trembled slightly.

Lu Yang distinctly felt a guiding force settle upon it.

It seemed that with just a thought, this guiding force would transport him to another unfamiliar realm.

"The time has come. Go."

True Master Chongguang spoke at the appropriate moment, "Everyone will be randomly dispersed upon entering the Heavenly Realm. Remember to first rendezvous with other True Disciples."

"Yuantu understands." Lu Yang nodded immediately.

The next second, a visible guiding light erupted from his disciple token, enveloping his entire body, and then descended towards the starry Heavenly Realm.

Inside the Starry Heavenly Realm.

As a small Heavenly Realm that had existed for an unknown period, on this day, it welcomed an unprecedented, super-massive meteor shower.

Jiangdong, Tianwu Dao Court.

Jiangxi, Shenle Pure Land.

Jiangbei, Primordial Sacred Demonic Sect.

Disciples from all three parties entered the realm together. They were supposed to be randomly dispersed as True Master Chongguang had described, but this time, a different variable emerged.

In a mountain forest within the Heavenly Realm, a Buddhist cultivator wearing a kasaya with a benevolent face descended into the woods. He then took out an exquisitely complex talisman and activated it. Soon, streams of light flashed, and three more figures with potent auras appeared beside the man.

"You monks certainly have many tricks up your sleeves."

One of the figures showed joy, "This 'Concentric Life-Knot Talisman' is indeed extraordinary. With it, we can gather ahead of time."

"Thank you, Master."

The other was a robust middle-aged man clad in black armor, standing with his hand on his sword. He said in a low voice, "There's no time to lose. I need to assemble the troops immediately."

The Buddhist cultivator heard this and pressed his palms together, "Amitābha, indeed, we cannot allow the Demonic Path to run rampant any longer."

The black-armored man was named Wang Jinting, an "Expeditionary General" officially appointed by the Dao Court. This time, he had even led an entire Dao Guard army to participate in the Path-Seizing War.

To put it bluntly, he was the leader of the Tianwu Dao Court's forces.

The Buddhist cultivator was named "Guanghai," a disciple of a newly advanced Arhat from the Shenle Pure Land, and was expected to attain the position of Guardian Vajra. He was also the leader of the Pure Land's forces.

The Dao Court and the Pure Land had long since colluded!

In the previous Path-Seizing War, True Master Yinshan had not yet formed his Foundation, but his divine abilities were unstoppable, allowing the Sacred Sect to gain a complete upper hand, even penetrating into Jiangnan. This time, the Dao Court and the Pure Land secretly conspired to reopen the Path-Seizing War, precisely to suppress the arrogance of the Demonic Path.

The next second, Wang Jinting took out a scroll from his bosom.

As the scroll unfurled, Wang Jinting made a hand seal and pointed, and instantly, a hazy mist arose, finally manifesting a grand panorama of mountains, rivers, and streams.

In addition, red dots twinkled on the map.

"This item is called the 'Comprehensive Spatial Survey Map.' It can detect all auras, big and small, within the Heavenly Realm, and then consume magical power to transport people to designated locations."

The Concentric Life-Knot Talisman, the Comprehensive Spatial Survey Map.

These were the Karma Fruit Treasures specifically condensed by the two True Monarchs of the Dao Court and Pure Land for this Path-Seizing War, and their effects were undoubtedly highly targeted.

The former allowed originally randomly dispersed disciples to quickly gather, while the latter could instantly pinpoint dispersed Primordial Sacred Sect disciples, thus achieving the goal of concentrating forces, fighting with numerical superiority, and seizing the initiative. If used well, it could even establish victory from the very beginning!
