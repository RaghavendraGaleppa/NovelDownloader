# Chapter 702: One Enters Samsara, Eight Directions Are Stirred

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan glanced at his avatar, Wukong, not far away.

At this moment, Wukong's true spirit had completely fused with the newly refined Stone Body avatar.

He clenched his fist, and the bones of the Stone Body emitted a sound like grinding metal and stone. Surging through his meridians was no longer Buddhist power, but the Foundation Establishment peak magic power simulated by the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi.

He stared at the Profound Mirror and suddenly bared his fangs with a grin.

"You want me to impersonate you and storm the Netherworld? Xu Yunfan, are you afraid your true body will have your Golden Core torn apart by the Blackwater Flood Dragon, so you're using me as a scapegoat?"

Xu Yunfan tapped the Profound Mirror with his fingertips, and ripples spread across its surface.

"The Netherworld Gate only allows passage for those with confused true spirits. If it senses the aura of a Golden Core, even a True Lord would have to flee in embarrassment under the backlash of the Sea of Suffering."

He tossed the Profound Mirror to Wukong.

"Hold this mirror, and you can disguise yourself as a true spirit returning to the void. The world will only perceive that Xu Yunfan's soul has entered samsara to seek his fruit of cultivation, but they won't know it's you."

People outside were watching him. Although he didn't know exactly who they were, whether in the light or the dark, the bait was ready to be cast. All that remained was to wait quietly to see who was plotting something.

No one would be able to sit still. Once he obtained the Blackwater Flood Dragon Dao Fruit of the Great Yin and stepped into the mid-stage of the Golden Core, the balance of power would inevitably be broken.

The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, and even the True Lords hiding in the dark would not be able to resist taking action.

This trip for Wukong was almost a dead certainty.

Wukong knew this clearly, but without the slightest hesitation, the moment he caught the Profound Mirror, the wood core on the back of the mirror seeped out a gentle vitality that enveloped his entire body.

An avatar wanting to regain its freedom is no easy task.

The instant he took hold of the Profound Mirror, his golden eyes suddenly contracted.

This treasure was actually drawing upon his remaining indestructible golden nature to maintain the illusion.

He instantly realized that Xu Yunfan was using him to test the waters.

"What a calculation!"

Wukong squeezed out a cold laugh from between his teeth.

"Using my golden nature to deceive the Netherworld Gate. If I die in the Sea of Suffering, this bit of origin will become your material for refining artifacts. If I happen to return, you only have to fulfill your promise to rebuild my Dao body. You lose nothing either way! Truly insidious to the bone."

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes calm and undisturbed.

"The path was your choice to take."

Hearing this, Wukong really wanted to curse out loud. If you hadn't forced me, would I have chosen this path?!

Before Wukong could speak, Xu Yunfan suddenly pointed two fingers toward Wukong's brow.

The Fiery Fire Cloud Qi burned intensely, the Earthly Earth Cloud Qi was heavy and deep. The bones of Wukong's face melted and reshaped like wax.

The pointed mouth and monkey cheeks faded away, the cheekbones rose, and the jawline became cold and hard, eventually freezing into the appearance of Xu Yunfan's true body. Only a trace of the monkey-like ferocity remained deep within his molten golden pupils.

"Not even changing the color of the eyes?" Wukong, wearing Xu Yunfan's face, mocked, "Do you want people to spot the flaw on purpose?"

"If the recorded information is correct, the Sea of Suffering in samsara is without light, so distinguishing colors is meaningless."

Xu Yunfan raised his hand and pressed it into the air. The Great Array of the Divine Cloud Mountain rumbled open a gap, and the aura of the outside world poured in.

"It's time to set off. Remember, the moment you enter the Netherworld Gate, immediately unleash the full power of the Profound Mirror. Your time is limited."

Wukong stroked the cold facial skin that was completely at odds with his own temperament and suddenly lowered his voice.

"If I find the Dao Fruit deep in the Sea of Suffering, but you go back on your word..."

"Then let's bet on it."

Xu Yunfan interrupted him, the corner of his mouth curling into a faint arc. "Bet on whether I would destroy the sharpest knife of the future for the sake of a single Great Yin Dao Fruit."

Wukong's golden eyes contracted sharply.

He understood the implied meaning.

Xu Yunfan wanted not only the Dao Fruit but also to use the Sea of Suffering to temper this blade of his!

Freedom and lack of restraint were possible, but the premise was that he had to become the knife in Xu Yunfan's hand.

After a long silence, Wukong, who had weighed his options in his heart for a long while, spat on the ground.

"Truly cunning enough."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed slightly, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.

He was genuinely afraid that Wukong would smash the pot and go for mutual destruction. If that happened, he would have to rely on that avatar, Han Shi, who in his opinion was only second-rate.

Xu Yunfan said seriously, "Rest assured, since you are my avatar, I can see everything through you. At critical moments, I can also make a move through your body."

Wukong was somewhat surprised. He truly hadn't expected that Xu Yunfan, who had refined an avatar, actually had such a method.

"You wouldn't happen to be practicing the One Qi Transforms Three Purities technique, and I'm your Evil Corpse, would you?"

To strike across realms from an immense distance was simply inconceivable. To other Golden Core True Lords, it would be irrational.

Xu Yunfan smiled slightly: "If I had truly severed my Evil Corpse, would I still be merely at the Golden Core level?"

Wukong said no more. He slapped the Profound Mirror against his chest.

The Soul-Stabilizing Pearl on the back of the mirror glowed with a dark light, and immense death qi covered his entire body. The Stone Body avatar that walked the world in Xu Yunfan's appearance instantly turned into a gray shadow and shot toward Samsara.

A cold wind billowed Wukong's robes.

He looked down at the surging gray mist at the bottom of the cliff. Within the mist, countless true spirits drifted about in a daze, converging toward a crack that connected heaven and earth deep within the mist.

The Netherworld Gate of Samsara.

Only the true spirits of heaven and earth can see it.

Between the cracks of the gate, spatial and temporal turbulence writhed like electric snakes, continuously swallowing the approaching true spirits.

"Xu Yunfan! You'd better keep your word..."

Wukong gritted his teeth and pressed the Profound Mirror into his spiritual platform.

The Samsara patterns on the mirror surface lit up, the vitality of the Soul-Nourishing Wood Core completely retracted, and his indestructible golden nature transformed into a dark golden membrane that wrapped around his true spirit.

The next instant, he leaped into the gray mist.

At the top of the cliff, the void stirred slightly. Xu Yunfan, using the Threefold Karma Secret Technique to hide his figure, appeared silently.

Watching the gray shadow that plunged into the Netherworld Gate, he held a jade talisman in his palm.

Imprinted within the talisman was the soul fluctuation of Wukong just before he leaped off the cliff, which was clearly of the same origin as Xu Yunfan's true body.

"The bait has been cast."

Xu Yunfan crushed the jade talisman and looked up into the distance.

The path of cultivation requires spending countless thoughts to take every step forward, not just in the actual practice, but also in dealing with all kinds of calamities.

In this world of cultivation, after reaching the Golden Core, every step forward will be announced to the heavens and earth, making it impossible to hide.

No one wants to have someone else above them, lording it over them.

Several powerful divine senses from the Nine Immortal Mountains of the Primordial Origin Sect swept over the Samsara Cliff, all catching the scent of Xu Yunfan's soul leaving its shell and forcibly breaking into the Sea of Suffering of Samsara.

At the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the Tianji Peak.

At the summit of the cold and precipitous sword peak, an icy aura that seemed capable of freezing the soul shrouded the area year-round.

The True Lord Tong Xuan, who possessed the Tianji Xuan Shu Sword Soul, sat cross-legged on a sword platform carved from ten-thousand-year-old profound ice. An intangible Sword Soul condensed and circulated around him, emitting a subtle yet terrifying hum.

His tightly closed eyes suddenly snapped open. Deep within his pupils, two cold star-like sword glows shot out, piercing through the cold mist swirling at the peak and stabbing sharply toward the direction of the Divine Cloud Mountain of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Just a moment ago, an extremely obscure yet exceptionally tenacious soul fluctuation had torn through the boundary between life and death, forcibly breaking into that Sea of Suffering belonging to the dead.

This fluctuation carried a scent that True Lord Tong Xuan could never forget—the destructive Dao rhyme of Divine Cloud Thunder!

"Xu! Yun! Fan!"

True Lord Tong Xuan squeezed these three words out from between his teeth. Each syllable contained boundless hatred and cold killing intent.

This person had destroyed his cave heaven, ruined his Dao foundation. Even flooding three rivers and five lakes would not be enough to vent his hatred.

In the battle at the Boundary Sea, he, a dignified Sword Soul True Lord of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, was actually wounded by a junior who had just entered the Golden Core, in collaboration with True Lord Dongming. Not only did he lose all face, but he also had to sacrifice a precious Sword Dao Spirit Treasure to escape, fleeing in utter embarrassment.
