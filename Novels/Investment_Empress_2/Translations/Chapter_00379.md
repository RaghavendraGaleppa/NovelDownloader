# Chapter 379: The Shocked Demonic Cultists and the Dream God's Inheritance Site

The snow-filled night was vast and white. Fine flakes of snow drifted in from the second-floor window, blending into the steam rising from the hot pot.

The young man sat before the pot, a table full of mutton laid out before him. With an air of nonchalance, he casually swished the meat in the broth.

The moment the Demonic Cultists from the Summon Demon Sect stepped onto the second floor and saw him, they knew this was the ‘Immortal’ waiting for them.

Some people are just like that.

Even if he appeared to be an ordinary person with no cultivation, sitting there, he was like a firefly in the pitch black—so conspicuous, so outstanding.

“Come a long way, so you are guests. The meat is just about ready. Please, take a seat.”

His voice came through the hot pot’s steam.

The Holy Son of the Summon Demon Sect narrowed his eyes, while the other cultists exchanged glances.

*Hiss...*

It was *their* reserved spot.

Yet this man had arrived early and even ordered the food beforehand. This feeling of being completely controlled was simply maddening.

“Immortal, it is such a pleasure to see you again.”

Luo Yexian chuckled obsequiously.

Li Mo smiled faintly. “By coincidence, I happened to pass by this hot pot restaurant. The aroma was so enticing that I decided to come in for dinner. I didn’t expect几位 to have chosen this very place for our meeting.”

“That just shows we are fated to be together, Immortal Heitu!”

Luo Yexian didn’t believe a single word of it.

If he came alone, why order so much mutton?

“Please, sit. Make yourselves at home,” Li Mo said, gesturing for the group of cultists to take their seats.

In reality, a faint spiritual fluctration came from the Ice Cube at his ear, her crisp voice sounding in his mind:

*“The Holy Son is probing your cultivation.”*

*“Not far from him, there are two other auras. They should be two experts of the Summon Demon Sect.”*

Hearing this, Li Mo looked at that sickly-looking young master.

Luo Yexian, observing his expression, quickly introduced, “This is my nephew, the Holy Son of the Summon Demon Sect... His Lordship.”

“Tan Zhuyin,” the Holy Son introduced himself as he sat down.

At this moment, he was extremely cautious. His secret probing earlier had revealed that the man before him was just an ordinary person with no cultivation.

But how could an ordinary person track their movements?

He was scrutinizing Li Mo, and Li Mo was scrutinizing him right back. The Eye of Destiny was already active.

**[Name: Tan Zhuyin]**
**[Age: 28]**
**[Physique: Ten Thousand Forms Evil Dragon Body (Incomplete State)]**
**[Cultivation: Ninth窍 of Observing the Deity Realm]**
**[Destiny: Gold]**
**[Evaluation: Born with a dragon form, a rare talent for practicing the Ten Thousand Forms Dragon Transformation Scripture. Formerly ranked first on the Hidden Dragon List. Half-step away from perfecting the Dragon Body, but was defeated by the Crown Prince of the Great Yu Dynasty, Jiang Yu.]**
**[Recent Events: Investigating the true strength of the Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect. Coinciding with the awakening of one of the Three Ancestral Deities of the Summon Demon Sect, the Dream God. Hopes to obtain its inheritance to take revenge on Jiang Yu and reclaim the top spot on the Hidden Dragon List.]**

*The Dream God?*

Li Mo couldn't help but recall the black Nian Beast that had died inside the Ice Cube’s dream three days ago.

“Observing the Deity Realm?”

The Holy Son had just asked the Dharma King to investigate, and the Dharma King had given him the answer.

The opponent was in the Observing the Deity Realm.

A Dharma Body Realm expert could easily see through the cultivation of another Dharma Body Realm expert. It seemed this man was using some kind of strange treasure?

However.

Why did a cultivator at the Observing the Deity Realm give off a feeling that, if one closed their eyes, he simply didn't exist?

Was it real or fake?

“It is a pity, Holy Son.”

Li Mo’s voice was calm, but his smiling expression suddenly turned cold as ice. “If your dragon form were complete, you could enter the Inner Scenery Realm with it. Then, you might have the qualification to enter an Immortal Sect and learn a few divine arts.”

“Your tone is quite arrogant,” Tan Zhuyin said expressionlessly, though he was inwardly shocked.

The man saw through his condition at a single glance!

And he was saying this right now...

“Why don’t you have the two behind you probe my cultivation again?”

---

Li Mo took a piece of mutton, maintaining his aloof and nonchalant demeanor.

He subtly activated the Shen Zhu of the Mirage Dragon.

The people behind him?

The opponent had discovered the two Dharma Kings?!

The two Dharma Body Realm experts hiding in the shadows were also startled. But what shocked them even more wasn't the fact that their presence had been detected.

They had probed again just now.

And they found that this young man had changed from the Observing the Deity Realm to the Inner Scenery Realm!

“Holy Son, this man is now in the Inner Scenery Realm... No, wait... he’s a mortal again...”

“What?!”

Tan Zhuyin’s pupils constricted, and he leaned back slightly.

The first probe showed a mortal, the second showed Observing the Deity Realm, and then it turned into Inner Scenery, only to finally return to the primordial state of a commoner!

His cultivation level was as unpredictable as the weather!

This was practically a clear warning that he was fully aware of every probing attempt!

“Please don’t take offense, Immortal. You know that our Sacred Sect is currently not tolerated by the Great Yu Dynasty. We have to be cautious in our actions. Besides, my nephew here was injured in his early years, and sometimes his mind... *cough*.”

Luo Yexian heard the displeasure in the Immortal Heitu’s voice and quickly put on a stern face. “Nephew, I told you that the Immortal is not someone ordinary people can probe. This makes our local sect seem incredibly rude!”

“My apologies. I was too cautious. Please forgive me, sir.”

Tan Zhuyin suppressed the turbulent waves in his heart. Even with his eccentric temperament, he was completely intimidated at this moment.

He was certain now.

Whether this man was a so-called ‘Immortal’ was hard to say, but he was definitely unfathomable!

And that so-called Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect...

Seeing the other party’s expression, Li Heitu let out a silent sigh of relief.

He had passed the test for now.

It was time to get to the main topic.

“It is fine. The Summon Demon Sect has only inherited a few methods from the Immortal Sect and has not received its true teachings. Having stayed in the mortal world for so long, it is inevitable that you have fallen into worldly ways.”

“However, you still have a connection with the Immortal Sect. As long as you return to the Immortal Sect’s gate early, why would you need to be in such a state?”

“By then, what would the Great Yu Dynasty be? The top of the Hidden Dragon List is nothing.”

Li Mo swished the mutton until it was tender and cooked, then swallowed it in an instant.

“The top of the Hidden Dragon List?”

A sharp glint flashed in Tan Zhuyin’s eyes.

His greatest wish in this life was to reassemble his dragon form and take revenge on Jiang Yu!

“The Dream God.”

Li Mo swallowed a mushroom and said calmly, “Isn’t the reason you came here for Him?”

“!!!”

Not just Tan Zhuyin, but all the Demonic Cultists present, including the two Dharma Kings hiding in the shadows, couldn't help but take a light breath of the hot pot steam.

This was a top secret of the sect!

What else did this man not know?!

The Demonic Cultists were all muttering to themselves. Could it be that their three Ancestral Deities really had an inseparable connection with the Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect?

Or perhaps... they were elders or something within the Immortal Sect?

No wonder he said their Sacred Sect only possessed a mere fraction of the Immortal Sect’s legacy!

“Would you be willing to accompany us to the Dream God’s inheritance site to investigate?” Tan Zhuyin asked, his breathing becoming rapid.

Immortal Heitu fell into thought.

Well, Li Mo was actually consulting with the Ice Cube.

Was that black Nian Beast related to this so-called ‘Dream God’?

Otherwise, why would the Dream God show signs of awakening right after the Nian Beast died?

Perhaps, that black Nian Beast was acting on the Dream God’s orders when it targeted the Ying family and Ying Bing?

Perhaps the one with ulterior motives regarding Ying Bing was actually the Dream God?

This concerned the Ice Cube.

Although accompanying the Summon Demon Sect on this exploration might not be peaceful, it was still necessary to go.

After finishing his thoughts, Li Mo nodded. “Very well. I shall make a trip there and lend a hand.”
