# Chapter 66: Observations at the Qintian Hall  

Li Changle guided the golden eagle to land on a plaza atop Feilai Peak.  

After instructing the eagle to wait there, he casually tossed aside the chain fastened around its neck and paid it no further mind.  

The golden eagle cowered like a quail!  

Ever since entering the territory of Shenxiao Palace and catching sight of the coiled black dragon on the mountain, it had felt an inexplicable divine sense settle upon it.  

Though the pressure of this divine sense wasn’t overwhelming, the eagle felt like a toad under the gaze of a great serpent—ready to be swallowed whole at any moment!  

Now, it huddled on the plaza paved with dark steel bricks, not daring to move a muscle.  

It could only hope that Li Changle and Han Yue would return quickly!  

Left alone here, it felt utterly defenseless!  

Meanwhile, Li Changle led Han Yue through winding corridors and gardens until they arrived before a grand hall.  

The hall was entirely constructed of black bronze and dark steel, without a single piece of wood—only cold, unyielding metal.  

The structure stood nearly twenty meters tall, supported by twelve massive bronze pillars so thick it would take several people to encircle them.  

The hall had no doors or windows, its architecture rugged and imposing!  

Han Yue looked up and saw a plaque above the entrance bearing three large characters: **Qintian Hall**.  

Li Changle strode inside, and Han Yue followed closely behind.  

The interior of the hall was sparsely furnished but well-lit.  

At that moment, an elderly Daoist with white hair and beard sat inside, seemingly having waited for some time.  

Without any courtesy, Li Changle spoke first:  

"Uncle-Master, you’re still alive? That’s excellent! Now that Tianyun has escaped his confinement, he can finally see you off in your old age!"  

The old Daoist glared at Li Changle with a constipated expression and retorted:  

"You, the doomed one, vanished for over three hundred years and left me in a miserable state!"  

"I’ve had to guard this Qintian Hall for three extra centuries on your behalf. You owe me—how about you just hand over **Qinggang** as compensation?"  

This old Daoist was none other than Shang Xi, the sole surviving elder of the Shang generation in Shenxiao Palace and the pillar of the sect in the era before last.  

Shang Xi also served as the current sect master of Shenxiao Palace. Though he had long wished to step down, the most suitable successor, Li Changle, had remained in a state of half-death, forcing Shang Xi to remain in his position indefinitely.  

"If you wanted to leave so badly, why didn’t you send someone to rescue me?"  

"I was unjustly imprisoned for three hundred years!"  

Li Changle voiced his grievances.  

During his imprisonment, he had repeatedly hoped for the sect’s aid—but none ever came.  

Shang Xi replied:  

"You brought this upon yourself. Others could’ve simply executed you, but they merely sealed you away for a few years—that’s already showing great restraint and respect for Shenxiao Palace."  

"Besides, your grandmaster and I agreed that tempering your arrogance wasn’t a bad thing. It’ll keep you from resorting to violence at every turn. Don’t you understand that the hardest steel shatters easiest?"  

"This ordeal will benefit your path of cultivation!"  

"Moreover, as the chief disciple of the Tian generation, you’ve cultivated for centuries without taking a single disciple. Who was supposed to rescue you?"  

"Should I, an old man, have gone myself?"  

"And look at the terrible example you’ve set by refusing to take disciples—you’re even worse than me! The Yuan generation that followed is pitifully sparse."  

"Your generation is already dead or reincarnated, with few survivors."  

"The Yuan generation hasn’t produced any outstanding talents either. All our hopes now rest on the Miao generation after them!"  

"But that’s your responsibility now. Hurry up and take over as sect master so I can depart for the Void."  

"Disciple has long been imprisoned and is now plagued by exhaustion. Please, Uncle-Master, lend your support for another two centuries. This disciple thanks you in advance!"  

"Enough of your nonsense! If I gave you two hundred years, you’d break through the Longevity Barrier and vanish before I could stop you!"  

"Today—right now—you’re not going anywhere! I’m taking you to the **Ancestral Hall**!"  

Tianyun and Shang Xi argued as if no one else were present. The position of sect master in this top-tier sect seemed like a hot potato, tossed back and forth between them!  

Han Yue remained silent, knowing such a spectacle was rare indeed.  

Before long, Li Tianyun spoke again:  

"You said I never took disciples, didn’t you? Well, I’ve returned with one this time."  

"Not only is his talent exceptional, but he’s also my savior!"  

"I must devote myself to his training and have no time to assume the role of sect master."  

Shang Xi wasn’t convinced:  

"Keep spinning tales! Did I ever teach my disciples? Did your master ever teach you?"  

"Since when has Shenxiao Palace needed a half-baked teacher like you to instruct disciples?"  

After harshly refuting Li Changle, Shang Xi turned to Han Yue with a kindly expression:  

"Yuanchu, was it? Don’t listen to your master’s nonsense. I’ve already arranged your entry into the sect. Your aura has been recorded, and you’re free to move about Shenxiao Palace as you please."  

"I’ve also arranged a suitable guide for you."  

"Your future cultivation will be guided by the most qualified elders. For now, you may leave. If you need anything, consult your guide. Your master and I still have matters to discuss!"  

With a wave of his hand, Shang Xi caused Han Yue’s vision to darken. When his sight returned, the scene before him had completely changed!  

He found himself standing at the foot of Wuhui Peak!  

The power of the Longevity Realm expert was beyond Han Yue’s comprehension—he had no idea how he’d been transported here.  

Nearby stood a refined courtyard with white walls and green tiles.  

Beside it was an enormous pit, within which rested a massive bronze ball chained with thick links.  

The bronze sphere was over two meters in diameter and unimaginably heavy.  

Hearing voices from the courtyard, Han Yue stepped forward and knocked on the door.  

Soon, the door opened, revealing a young girl clad in a purple horse-face skirt.  

She stood no taller than 1.45 meters, with a fair, oval face, jet-black hair, and smiling eyes—adorable and lively.  

Holding the door with one hand, she munched on a crimson fruit with the other.  

Upon seeing Han Yue, she immediately exclaimed:  

"Uncle-Master Yuanchu, you’re here!"  

"Grandmaster Sect Leader has already instructed me to assist you with your initiation!"  

Han Yue was surprised:  

"You know me?"  

"Of course! When Elder Li returned earlier, he showed us your image!"  

"All thirty-four disciples currently in the sect should recognize you by now!"  

"You called me ‘Uncle-Master’? Then you must be of the Miao generation. How should I address you?" Han Yue asked.  

"My Daoist name is Miaolin, but my birth name is Wang Mumu. You can call me Mumu—many senior brothers do," the girl replied.  

"Very well, Mumu. You said there are only thirty-four disciples in the sect right now? Where are the rest of Shenxiao Palace’s members?" Han Yue couldn’t help but ask.  

"Many are out traveling and rarely return to the sect."  

"I see. Then how many members does our sect have in total?"  

"Counting you, Uncle-Master, Shenxiao Palace now has 106 members!"  

"And with your addition, the number of disciples below the fourth rank has reached fifty-three—finally balancing the number of Realms above the fourth rank again!"
