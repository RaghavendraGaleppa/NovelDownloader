**Chapter 19: Harvesting the Spirit Fields and Paying Rent**  

The speed of flight depends on the quality of the magical artifact and the cultivator’s spiritual power.  

For example, even with the same low-grade flying artifact, the speed differs between an early-stage Qi Refinement cultivator and a late-stage one. The latter would naturally be much faster.  

However, there is a limit.  

Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator using a low-grade flying artifact wouldn’t be faster than a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. The reason is simple—the quality of the artifact determines the maximum amount of spiritual power it can handle.  

A Foundation Establishment cultivator’s spiritual power is far stronger than that of a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, but it’s like trying to fit a ten-centimeter screw into a three-centimeter nut. It’s impossible. Even if forced, the nut would be ruined.  

Thus, to fly faster, one must at least possess a high-quality flying artifact.  

High-grade flying artifacts are expensive, making them unattainable for most ordinary disciples. Yet, Zhang Yan owned two—the Golden Bamboo Sword and the Greenwood Boat.  

The Greenwood Boat was a high-grade flying artifact, while the Golden Bamboo Sword was mid-grade. In theory, the Greenwood Boat should be much faster, but it consumed too much spiritual power. At Qi Refinement’s second stage, using it was like a small horse pulling a heavy cart.  

On the other hand, the Golden Bamboo Sword, being a mid-grade artifact, required less spiritual power. Combined with the "Extreme Speed" attribute provided by the Greenwood Boat, it could achieve surprising speed, exceeding others’ expectations.  

"The uses of attributes are endless. I need to collect more second-hand artifacts," Zhang Yan mused silently.  

With that thought, he turned his gaze to his two hundred acres of spirit fields.  

Artifacts weren’t free—even second-hand ones required money. For now, farming was his only way to earn.  

And so, three months passed in the blink of an eye.  

During this time, Zhang Yan’s cultivation had improved. However, the most significant progress was in his techniques.  

Thanks to the Enlightenment Cushion, his Evergreen Technique had reached the Great Achievement stage, greatly accelerating his absorption of spiritual energy.  

But the most astonishing progress was in the Wood Essence Technique. Not only had it reached Great Achievement, but it was also just a step away from Perfection. He estimated that in less than half a year, he could achieve it.  

"Qi Refinement’s second stage with a perfected technique..."  

Zhang Yan was no longer the clueless novice he once was. He knew exactly how extraordinary this was.  

It meant that in the remaining time, he could master other techniques to perfection. By the time he reached Foundation Establishment, he might even have three—or even five—perfected techniques!  

Perhaps even more.  

Zhang Yan’s eyes gleamed with ambition.  

"First, a small goal—nine perfected techniques!"  

Legends spoke of an immortal from the Upper Realm who reincarnated, cultivated for eighty years, perfected nine techniques, and then broke through to Foundation Establishment in a single day, becoming invincible among his peers.  

Nine perfected techniques sounded insane—something most wouldn’t even dare to imagine. But for Zhang Yan, it wasn’t an impossible dream. With effort, he could achieve it.  

Aside from the Wood Essence Technique, his Golden Grass-Cutting Sword had also reached the Small Achievement stage. At this level, the spell was faster and more powerful. Unfortunately, without the "Sharpness" attribute, it was still only useful for cutting weeds.  

But with the "Sharpness" attribute, it was a different story—its power surpassed ordinary attack spells, and its cutting effect was exceptionally sharp.  

The only downside was his lack of equipment. He couldn’t gather three "Sharpness" attributes yet.  

"Still..."  

Zhang Yan glanced at the distant spirit fields. The spirit rice was ready for harvest.  

Since he had leased the fields on a profit-sharing basis due to his lack of spirit stones, the Sect Affairs Hall needed to verify the yield before he could harvest.  

He had already notified them, and soon, a plump, fair-skinned Daoist arrived on a flying boat.  

"Greetings, Elder Bai."  

Zhang Yan stepped forward to welcome him.  

"Ah, no need for formalities, Junior Brother Zhang."  

Elder Bai waved his hand with a smile as he disembarked. "I assume you know why I’m here. According to the contract, sharecroppers must hand over seventy percent to the sect."  

"Understood, Elder Bai."  

Zhang Yan was aware of this. But what could he do? He hadn’t had any spirit stones at the time.  

"If I recall correctly, Junior Brother Zhang is a spirit farmer, right?"  

"Indeed. I passed Senior Brother Wang’s assessment at the Sect Affairs Hall," Zhang Yan confirmed.  

"Good. Senior Brother Wang mentioned you, and the sect offers preferential treatment to spirit farmers—a fifty-fifty split on harvests. Moreover, since you’re using Senior Brother Wang’s spirit rice seeds, this can be considered an experimental field. Thus, you only need to pay thirty percent in rent."  

Elder Bai smiled as he reviewed the contract.  

"This… is acceptable?"  

Zhang Yan was genuinely shocked.  

Originally, he would have had to surrender seventy percent of the harvest. But after Elder Bai’s adjustments, it was reduced to thirty percent—all within the sect’s rules.  

Most importantly, what would have been a profit of a hundred spirit stones now became over two hundred and thirty.  

"Many thanks, Elder Bai!"  

Zhang Yan quickly expressed his gratitude.  

"No need for thanks. Senior Brother Wang mentioned that you’re not just a spirit farmer but also skilled in the Wood Essence Technique. Is that true?"  

Elder Bai’s gaze was intense.  

"I’ve only dabbled in the Wood Essence Technique," Zhang Yan replied cautiously.  

He knew the real purpose of this visit was about to be revealed. Elder Bai had no reason to help him so generously unless he needed something. Given the focus on spirit farming and the Wood Essence Technique, it likely involved plants.  

"In that case, I won’t hide it. I have a spirit herb that was damaged during harvesting. I was wondering if you could revive it. If not, it’s fate. But if you succeed, I’ll reward you handsomely!"  

Elder Bai looked at Zhang Yan anxiously. This herb was extremely important to him.  

"May I see the herb first?"  

Though the Wood Essence Technique could nourish plants, Zhang Yan didn’t immediately agree. He wanted to assess the situation first.
