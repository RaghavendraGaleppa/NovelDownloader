# Chapter 43: Underwater Waterfall, Immortal's Palace?

Seeing the overwhelming might emanating from Fierce Tiger, the Black-striped Shark's pupils constricted. How could it dare to hold back? It immediately opened its mouth, filled with sharp fangs, and swiftly spat out a huge water arrow. Unfazed by this, Fierce Tiger's great axe burst forth with yellow light. He lifted it and brought it down, directly breaking the spell with brute force as the axe blade rapidly cleaved through the water arrow. With a *bang*, the axe struck directly onto the Black-striped Shark's sharp teeth, which were as hard as steel, sending sparks flying.

Seeing that a single axe strike had made its teeth tremble, Fierce Tiger didn't hesitate. The shield in his left hand swiftly transformed into a glowing, massive hammer, which he slammed onto the Black-striped Shark's eyeball with a crash. A pained whimper echoed, and the Black-striped Shark was knocked down.

"Hmph! In the water, I might fear you seven parts, but on land, you dare to act so arrogantly with me? You're simply courting death!" Having gained the upper hand in two moves, Fierce Tiger smirked triumphantly. However, he didn't dare to press his advantage, because below, the Infant-Carp Beast, with its infant-like head, carp-like body, and buffalo-like size, was watching him. Furthermore, the three-headed snake next to it had fierce glints in its eyes, also staring upwards covetously. Water vapor permeated the surroundings, suggesting it could ascend on clouds at any moment.

Such a posture greatly increased Fierce Tiger's vigilance. The only one here capable of aerial combat was the three-headed snake. It could gather water into clouds and fly through the air; this was its innate talent, and it was what everyone was strictly guarding against at the moment. As for the Black-striped Shark and the Infant-Carp Beast, they lacked such abilities. Although one had sharp teeth and a deadly mouth, and the other possessed an invincible sonic roar, making them both powerful, neither could fly into the sky. However, if they could become Demon Kings, they would be able to break free from environmental restrictions and transcend their inherent talents. They could transform into a wisp of demonic qi, capable of ascending to the heavens or delving into the earth, going anywhere—truly formidable. But Demon Kings were extremely rare, much like Nascent Soul True Monarchs among humans. There were only a few dozen throughout the entire Thousand Islands Sea Region, making them rarely seen.

"These fellows, causing a riot once every three to five years, destroying my newly built palace again. Sooner or later, I'll make you pay!" Fierce Tiger declared sternly, resting his great axe on his shoulder.

Yang Ji heard this, looked down, then shifted his gaze towards the sea surface, searching for the source of the beasts' [Dread]. "Could it be a slumbering Demon King awakening to feed?" he speculated, while observing the sea. As his gaze delved deeper into the seabed, information continuously appeared: [Seawater], [Seaweed], [Reefs], [Turbulent Seawater], [Seabed strata extensively fracturing], [Seabed tremors], [A terrifying earthquake affecting nearly half of the Foul Demon Sea Region will erupt in thirty breaths of time.]

"Earthquake?" Yang Ji was startled, a sudden realization dawning on him. "No wonder those demon beasts were desperately rushing to the islands. That way, there's still a fifty percent chance of survival. If they stayed in the sea, confronting the terrifying power of nature, they'd probably be shaken to death!"

He had originally thought it was a beast tide, but it turned out to be an earthquake. Facing a great earthquake directly! Although he had already embarked on the path of cultivation, a sense of awe still arose in his heart. Although the earthquake hadn't erupted yet, his heart had already begun to tremble, and his breathing couldn't help but quicken. The ocean suffered countless natural disasters: lightning, earthquakes, storms, all were commonplace. He had been fortunate enough to witness the Extreme Violet Heavenly Lightning before, but he hadn't expected to encounter an earthquake this time.

Time passed breath by breath. Yang Ji's heartbeat also grew increasingly intense. He had thought knowing the answer would make his heart calmer, but unexpectedly, the more he knew, the more restless his heart became. There was no sudden shock like that of an unexpected earthquake, but rather the oppressive feeling of time slowly weighing on his heart. As time drew closer, and the final breath passed, his heartbeat reached its peak.

Suddenly, after a moment of complete silence, *Boom!* A deafening rumble echoed from the seabed. The seabed strata rapidly fractured with extreme violence. The terrifying energy of the earthquake was like a giant man wielding a massive hammer, smashing it onto a concrete slab. Centered at the epicenter, the seabed strata extensively cracked. The power of nature was unfathomable. As countless rock layers fractured, they violently ripped through the surface of the sea, thrusting upwards. The terrifying force contained within them reverberated outwards, instantly triggering hundred-zhang tidal waves that surged in all directions.

The massive waves were like the hands of a god descending from the heavens, slapping onto the islands. In an instant, countless demon beasts perished. The earthquake's power was relentless, and the tsunamis were ceaseless, wave after wave surging in all directions. The entire sea, as far as the eye could see, was now rows upon rows of towering waves, like reapers of the ocean, advancing everywhere.

*Rumble!*

*Rumble!*

The seawater surged wildly, and the terrifying tremors made the entire massive Black Wind Island tremble, as if it could collapse and disintegrate at any moment. The horrifying earthquake, by shaking the seawater and compressing the air, seemed to make the entire sky tremble. The earthquake struck violently, erupting with a bang. It wasn't until the air surged and slapped their faces that everyone belatedly reacted.

"It's an earthquake!"

"An earthquake actually erupted."

"Damn it, my Black Wind Island, please don't be destroyed." Fierce Tiger, at this moment, watched the precarious Black Wind Island "trembling" amidst the tsunami. Besides being shocked, his heart was in his throat.

"What a terrifying earthquake! The tsunamis it stirred up are endless as far as the eye can see. How wide an area did this earthquake affect?" someone exclaimed in surprise.

"Fortunately, the epicenter isn't near here, otherwise our Black Wind Island would sink."

"Bah! You jinx!" Fierce Tiger glared at him fiercely, then looked at the hundred-zhang waves crashing towards the island, already filled with worry. "With such terrifying power, I'd probably be flattened into a meat patty if I went down there."

"No, it would directly smash you to pieces, instantly exploding you!"

Everyone looked at the terrifying spectacle of the raging waves, their hearts still filled with fear. Yang Ji also felt the violent side of nature beneath its usual tranquility. Such immense power, he feared, could only be resisted by a Nascent Soul True Monarch manifesting their Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol. Gazing at the enraged sea, everyone was trembling with fear.

The earthquake lasted an entire night, only completely subsiding by dawn. When the earthquake receded, the fractured underground rock layers that had risen to the surface remained permanently, forming protruding reefs in the sea. While new reefs were born, Black Wind Island was ravaged, a scene of desolation and ruin. The surviving demon beasts on the island had long since fled into the sea. Everyone also flew down and began post-disaster reconstruction.

It wasn't until three days later that some cultivators who had gone out to investigate returned with a peculiar piece of news. "Island Lord, the brothers who went out said that the epicenter of this great earthquake was near Wangmo Island. There, the rock layers fractured and surged upwards, forming an underwater waterfall a thousand zhang deep in the sea. Spiritual light surged from within the fissure, and it hasn't dissipated even now."

A Foundation Establishment Hall Master said, handing over a wooden beam soaked in seawater. "Island Lord, look, this wooden beam is said to have surged out of the waterfall fissure along with the rock layers."

"This is... Thousand-Year Golden Steel Wood! Looking at its shape, could it be a piece of eaves? My heavens, this is an utter waste of natural resources! Whose eaves would be made of Golden Steel Wood? This is excellent material for crafting top-grade magical artifacts! Who's so extravagant?" Fierce Tiger exclaimed, eyes wide.

"I don't know," the Foundation Establishment Hall Master said, frowning slightly. "Spiritual light is surging from within the waterfall fissure. Everyone says there's probably an immortal's abode hidden inside."

"This... let me see." Beside them, Yang Ji stared at the thigh-thick Golden Steel Wood, his eyes flickering with surprise and uncertainty. He took it, brought it to his nose, and sniffed, his heart instantly shaking. "Although this Golden Steel Wood is different from the wood that encased the humanoid weapon, the scent on it is identical."

"Could it be that the humanoid weapon came from within that waterfall fissure?"
