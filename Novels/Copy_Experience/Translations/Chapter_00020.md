**Chapter 20: Blackscale Serpent**

Seeing the numbers on the bluestone tablet for alchemy, Lu Xu's face lit up with joy. This Elder Mo's alchemy experience was truly rich; his low-grade Tier 1 pills were almost at full proficiency.

"It was worth going to the Mo family this time. If not for this opportunity, where would I find a suitable alchemist normally?"

"It's a shame the earth fire in this market city is monopolized by the Mo family. I'll have to find other ways to refine pills!"

"It seems the matter of leaving the Mo family needs to be put on the agenda!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

He had been contemplating leaving Qinghu Market City for a long time. However, due to various concerns, he had never acted. There were rogue cultivators causing trouble outside the market city, and leaving might attract their attention. Especially with Tan Hu being a hidden danger, Lu Xu felt that Tan Hu and the organization behind him would probably be delighted if he left Qinghu Market City!

Furthermore, his spiritual farmer contract with the Mo family hadn't been completed. If he fled, he would be hunted down by the Mo family. The Mo family's influence was not small; they had their own people in every market city that rogue cultivators in Wei State could visit. Unless Lu Xu hid in the mortal world and never came out, it would be truly difficult to escape the Mo family's control.

"This matter requires careful planning. My little bit of disguise skill won't fool the Spirit Eye Art! Rogue cultivators aren't like the cultivators in those shops who dare not offend customers!" Lu Xu pondered for a while.

The next afternoon, Han Erlengzi arrived at the courtyard with his two new wives. Old Man Xu presented a talisman as a wedding gift. Lu Xu, on the other hand, gave a few catties of spiritual beast meat as a token gesture, and also mentioned the twenty spirit stones. Han Erlengzi was still a bit shy, blushing as he conversed with them for a while, then directed a few mortals to move his belongings out of his house. He was moving to the Mo family, where he would live on the Tier 2 spiritual vein from now on. He wouldn't have to be a spiritual farmer anymore; his task would be to diligently cultivate more descendants with cultivation aptitude for the Mo family.

"That kid will enjoy a good life from now on, at least better than He Qing!" Old Man Xu said, hands clasped behind his back.

"He Qing couldn't even find someone to marry into their family!" Lu Xu sighed.

"If you give up the idea of Foundation Establishment and don't plan to establish a cultivation family, then marrying into the Mo family isn't bad for you either!" Old Man Xu told Lu Xu.

"Me? We'll see later!"

Lu Xu turned and went back to his room. From then on, only he and Old Man Xu remained in the courtyard.

More than ten days later.

"Hiss! Hiss!"

On this day, Lu Xu had just finished tending to the spiritual fields and was about to head home when he suddenly heard a strange sound. He turned to look and his expression instantly changed. From the distant grass, a scaly head emerged, its cold eyes staring at him. Its body, nearly a丈 (zhang, approximately 3.3 meters) long, was covered in scales, gleaming with a cold light in the setting sun, sending a chill down one's spine. It was a large snake, completely black, exuding dense demonic aura.

"How can a Blackscale Serpent appear in this place? Where's the patrol squad?"

Lu Xu's heart leaped in alarm. Without time to think, he quickly pulled out several talismans from his sleeve.

"Hiss! Hiss!"

The snake flicked its tongue, then suddenly transformed into a black streak of light, shooting towards him at high speed. Lu Xu quickly activated a talisman, and a Water Shield Talisman formed a protective barrier around his body. Immediately after, an Earth Thorn Talisman flew out, and dozens of sharp stone thorns, thumb-thick and an inch long, densely sprouted from the ground ahead.

*Clink! Clang!*

The stone thorns accurately struck the Blackscale Serpent's body, but the expected penetration did not occur. Instead, they produced a sound like striking metal. The large snake twisted its body, and a tremendous force emanated, directly snapping the stone thorns. Lu Xu hadn't expected a single Earth Thorn Talisman to kill this demonic beast. He used the time it took for the opponent to break through the stone thorns to quickly pull out more talismans from his pocket.

Two Entanglement Talismans flew out consecutively, and instantly, vines sprouted from the ground, binding the Blackscale Serpent.

"Go!"

A flash of green light flickered in Lu Xu's sleeve, and a small sword hovered before his eyes, its tip trembling slightly. Spiritual energy surged into it, and the Azure Radiance Sword soon glowed brightly with green light.

*Zheng!*

After a clear ringing sound, the Azure Radiance Sword transformed into a stream of light, speeding away. In the blink of an eye, it flew above the Blackscale Serpent and slashed down fiercely.

*Bang!*

A dull, heavy sound resounded, and the ground directly sank in a large area, as black blood spread out. Amidst the swirling dust, frantic hissing sounds erupted. The Blackscale Serpent thrashed wildly, instantly breaking large sections of the stone thorns and tearing free from the vines' restraints, charging towards Lu Xu.

However, what greeted it were one fireball after another. Fireballs the size of human heads continuously flew out, striking the Blackscale Serpent and engulfing it. Lu Xu successively activated five Fireball Talismans. After all the fireballs extinguished, the demonic serpent lay motionless on the ground. Black blood submerged the large pit created by the Azure Radiance Sword, forming a small pool of blood.

Lu Xu reached out, and the Azure Radiance Sword flew back into his sleeve. Using this mid-grade magic tool was a great burden for him; that single slash alone had consumed at least a quarter of his spiritual energy. Lu Xu's face was somewhat pale, and he felt both shocked and doubtful, wondering if something had gone wrong with the Mo family's patrol team. Normally, under their supervision, it would be almost impossible for demonic beasts to reach the spiritual fields. Only some demonic insects would occasionally sneak in. But those demonic insects were very weak, not even Tier 1 demonic beasts, and a single Spirit Farmer Gengjin Art could easily eradicate them.

The Blackscale Serpent that had just appeared was a well-known low-grade Tier 1 demonic beast in Qinghu, with scales impervious to blades and spears. Normally, only cultivators at the mid-stage of Qi Condensation could hunt this demonic beast.

"It's a good thing I have many methods. If it were Old Man Zhang, a proper spiritual farmer, even at the third layer of Qi Condensation, he would probably be eaten by this demonic snake!"

"Something strange is going on. It's no longer safe here!"

Lu Xu's expression slowly darkened. While he was wondering what exactly had happened on the Mo family's side, he was also troubled by how to deal with this Blackscale Serpent. Carrying it directly into the market city would be too ostentatious. He wasn't an adventuring cultivator; rashly producing such a demonic snake would make others suspicious of him.

Just as Lu Xu was deep in thought, a figure suddenly appeared not far away.

*Clap, clap, clap!*

Tan Hu applauded as he slowly walked over. "Fellow Daoist Lu, impressive methods. To think you could kill this Blackscale Serpent. I underestimated you!"
