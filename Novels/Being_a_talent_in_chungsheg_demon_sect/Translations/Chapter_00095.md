# Chapter 95: Let Senior Sister Yu Suffer a Little More

No sooner said than done, Lu Yang immediately transformed into a streak of light and soared into the sky.

The Myriad Spirit Banner was raised high, its pennant fluttering, obscuring the sun. A vast shadow rapidly expanded from Lu Yang's position, spreading towards the eight hundred li Skeleton Mountain, especially within the Witch Ghost Secret Realm.

One by one, the witch ghosts were converted into banner spirits by Lu Yang, including the eight red-robed ghosts that formed the [Yama Hall] and the Dharma Protector Goddess Sunu.

"Even its color has changed," Lu Yang murmured. As countless witch ghosts poured into the Myriad Spirit Banner, the originally pure white banner gradually turned a deep purple, just like the Dharma Protector Goddess Sunu. This way, should he restart with the Myriad Spirit Banner, the [Yama Hall] could be perfectly inherited, ensuring that he would have a Foundation Establishment Dharma Protector Goddess to conceal heavenly secrets from the very beginning of his next life. The effect, he surmised, wouldn't be inferior to the Innate Primordial Chaos Qi Divine Talisman, and he wouldn't alarm the Peak Master of Mending Heaven Peak again.

"Oh, right, I almost forgot you." Thinking of this, Lu Yang suddenly shook the Myriad Spirit Banner, and from it, he retrieved an old Daoist priest with a blank expression, lifeless eyes, and the youthful face of a crane-haired elder.

The Peak Master of Mending Heaven Peak! More precisely, it was a soul clone of the Peak Master of Mending Heaven Peak, personally severed from his soul to escape the suction force of the [Yama Hall]. Immediately after, Lu Yang summoned Chen Xin'an. This one was actually also a soul clone of the true Chen Xin'an, not his main body. Upon appearing, he stared wide-eyed at the Mending Heaven Peak Master's soul clone, his face filled with disbelief.

"How is this possible...?"

"Nothing is impossible," Lu Yang said with a faint smile. "You two share a deep father-son bond, and I, being kind-hearted, specially invited him into the Myriad Spirit Banner to reunite with you." At this point, Lu Yang suddenly thought of a very interesting question. Now that both Chen Xin'an and the Mending Heaven Peak Master's soul clones had become his banner spirits, would they still exist if he chose the Myriad Spirit Banner upon restarting? And if they did, would it affect the real Peak Master of Mending Heaven Peak and Chen Xin'an?

"Interesting." Lu Yang's mind raced, and in an instant, many excellent ways to utilize them sprung to mind. Perhaps in his next life, he could make the Peak Master of Mending Heaven Peak shoulder a massive scapegoat... Of course, that was a matter for his next life.

Withdrawing his thoughts, Lu Yang looked at Chen Xin'an and the Mending Heaven Peak Master's soul clones. "I plan to cultivate the *Heavenly Silkworm Secret of Severing Thoughts to See the Self*. You two will serve as my protectors."

The *Heavenly Silkworm Secret of Severing Thoughts to See the Self* was a great divine ability that transformed a Qi Refining cultivator's spiritual sense into a Foundation Establishment cultivator's divine sense. To master it, one needed to sever nine soul clones from one's own soul. According to the description of the divine ability, these nine clones represented nine extreme emotions that plagued Lu Yang's 'true self': joy from seeing, anger from hearing, love from smelling, longing from tasting, desire from thought, sorrow from the body, greed from form and color, resentment and wrath, and ignorance and delusion. These were known as the "Three Poisons and Six Desires." Only by severing them all could one see their true self.

"The first one: joy from seeing." Lu Yang silently activated the incantation, his spiritual sense transforming into a blade. Then, with the aid of Dharma Protector Goddess Sunu's calculative power, he precisely struck the first blow against his own soul. The next second, Lu Yang felt his soul lighten. A ray of spiritual light was severed by him, taking root upon landing, and surprisingly transformed into a soul shadow identical to his own appearance.

"Hahahahahahaha!" As soon as this soul shadow appeared, it immediately covered its eyes with one hand, placed the other on its hip, looked up at the sky, and then let out an indescribable burst of maniacal laughter. Almost simultaneously, a vast surge of emotions flooded Lu Yang's mind. The joy of cultivation, the joy of breakthrough, the joy of dual cultivation, the joy of successful schemes... countless joyful emotions from his past and present lives all surfaced! Although Lu Yang had prepared himself, he was still impacted by this intense surge of emotion, his eyes turning bloodshot.

Just then, Chen Xin'an and the Mending Heaven Peak Master, who had been commanded to protect him, suddenly moved. They exhaled and let out a thundering celestial sound: "Halt!" The sound waves were like a clear spring, pouring down, instantly smoothing out the countless surges of inexplicable ecstasy that had arisen in Lu Yang's heart, and restoring his expression to calmness.

"Soul divine abilities... truly bizarre." Lu Yang frowned slightly. He could feel that this was merely treating the symptoms; the influence of the soul clone was temporarily suppressed, but it would only erupt more fiercely later. This was the difficulty of cultivating the *Heavenly Silkworm Secret of Severing Thoughts to See the Self*. The severed soul clones would continuously emanate various extreme emotions to affect the cultivator. Only by suppressing all these emotions from the soul clones with one's own power, reaching a state of "heart as clear as ice," could the divine ability be considered complete.

"These emotions are too troublesome." Lu Yang's brows were tightly furrowed. A karmic connection existed between him and the soul clones, so even if he suppressed them, these emotions would continuously surge forth...

"Hmm? Karmic connection?" After a moment of silence, Lu Yang turned to look at Sunu, who was guarding him. If he remembered correctly, Dharma Protectors seemed capable of transferring karma? Lu Yang tried it, and the karma suddenly shifted. The next second, Sunu suddenly, without warning, tugged at the corners of her mouth, revealing a wide smile, only to quickly suppress it, her face showing panic: "My Lord?"

"Hold it in! Don't let it out!" Lu Yang said sharply, without hesitation grafting the karmic connection of 'joy from seeing' onto Sunu, making her bear the emotional impact in his stead. "Continue!" Without further ado, Lu Yang quickly struck eight more blows, severing all the remaining eight soul clones, and then grafted them all onto Sunu's body.

Instantly, Sunu collapsed onto the ground, drenched in sweat, her long black hair soaked and plastered to her exquisite face. The noble solemnity she once held as a Dharma Protector Goddess was utterly gone; her captivating eyes, once alluring, now held only bewilderment and dullness. She was practically drooling. As Lu Yang watched Sunu's pained and conflicted expression, brought on by the chaotic emotional onslaught from the soul clones, he suddenly felt much better.

*This is what Dharma Protectors are for! Otherwise, what use is she to me?*

"Also, the [Corpse Release Immortal] needs Sunu to bless it with her Foundation Establishment status to speed up its completion. Very well, then, let Senior Sister Yu suffer a little more." With Sunu's help, Lu Yang believed that the *True Corpse Release Method of Lunar Metamorphosis* and the *Heavenly Silkworm Secret of Severing Thoughts to See the Self*, both of which would originally take at least several decades each to master, could now be perfected within three months. His chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment could also reach seventy percent in one go! "And with the agreement of the [Heavenly Corpse Malice], I can also demand the Ascension Token in True Man Yinshan's hands." "At that point, it'll be an eighty percent chance of success."

That's not low! Thinking of this, Lu Yang felt a little excited. After all, he wasn't aiming for 'perfect Foundation Establishment'; an eighty percent chance was enough to go all in.

Holy Sect, Cloud Sea Connecting Heaven.

The Peak Master of Mending Heaven Peak quietly returned to Mending Heaven Peak. He first activated the peak's mountain protection array, then retrieved some earth to sculpt a new physical body. However, before he could even stand firm, a silvery, bell-like voice drifted over: "Father, weren't you going to catch someone? Why did you come back empty-handed?"

"..." Upon hearing this, the Mending Heaven Peak Master's body stiffened. Then, with a helpless expression, he turned to look at his daughter, Chen Shuqian. "Father made a blunder and failed to capture him."

Chen Shuqian paused, then her delicate brows raised slightly. "Father, you lost?"

"I didn't lose." After a moment of silence, the Mending Heaven Peak Master said sternly, "That junior came to deceive and ambush me, destroying my physical body and leaving me with less than one-tenth of my usual power."

"Father, did you *really* lose?"

"I didn't lose!" The Mending Heaven Peak Master gritted his teeth. "I merely let that junior be arrogant for a few days. Do you think he'll fare well? He'll realize his mistake when he attempts to break through to Foundation Establishment." He sneered. "That junior calculated everything, but the only thing he miscalculated was coveting the so-called third-grade true qi. Qian'er, you're still young and don't understand the treachery of human hearts. Any opportunity in this world requires a price to be paid. If the inheritance left by Panlong in the past was truly that good, why do you think I would leave it to others instead of keeping it for you and Xin'an? Furthermore, Panlong was merely a Foundation Establishment rogue cultivator during his lifetime. Do you truly believe his cultivation method could rank third-grade and directly lead to the Golden Core Great Dao?"
