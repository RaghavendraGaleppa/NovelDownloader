# Chapter 23: Famous Sword and Noble Steed  

One sword strike.  

Another sword strike.  

Zhao Manren was stunned.  

The black-robed martial artist, whose internal energy was as vast as mountains and seas, appeared to Zhao Manren to possess strength no less than that of a Xiantian Zhenjing expert—perhaps even surpassing it.  

Such power, such arrogance.  

Yet he had been slain by Dou Changsheng with a single sword stroke.  

What followed was even more astonishing. The enemy charging in on horseback was someone Zhao Manren recognized—Long Ying.  

A notorious, villainous bandit of the martial world. Despite despising his conduct, Zhao Manren had to acknowledge that Long Ying was a Wuhui Chaoyuan expert, a true master of the Xiantian Zhenjing realm.  

There was no exaggeration here—this was a genuine grandmaster of the Five Qi. His Xiantian internal energy had already transformed into Xiantian true qi, granting him unparalleled might with every move.  

Yet such a formidable opponent, whom Zhao Manren had feared might doom their mission to reclaim the military supplies, was effortlessly beheaded by Dou Changsheng in a single strike.  

The speed of his kills was nothing short of terrifying.  

Zhao Manren couldn't help but stare at Dou Changsheng, recalling the words spoken that morning:  

*"I'm all bark and no bite—just a bit more Xiantian internal energy than most. My swordsmanship is limited to a single move, barely enough to hold my own."*  

A *bit* more?  

Zhao Manren's face twitched involuntarily at the memory of Dou Changsheng's humble self-deprecation.  

This was the very definition of *fàn'ěrsài*—humblebragging at its finest.  

All his doubts about Dou Changsheng had now vanished. This was no simple country boy.  

What village youth could possess such profound Xiantian internal energy and such exquisite swordsmanship at such a young age?  

Dou Changsheng's strength was unfathomable. The fact that he could kill a Xiantian Zhenjing expert in one stroke only meant that his opponent had been *merely* Xiantian Zhenjing.  

Zhao Manren was shocked. The blue-robed middle-aged man was despairing.  

But Dou Changsheng did not stop. After cleanly executing the Xiantian Zhenjing expert, he turned his sword toward the purple-robed giant.  

The blade flashed like a shooting star, a streak of cold light slicing through the air.  

Though the purple-robed giant's face was ashen, he had not yet given up. With a forceful lift of his broadsword, he attempted to block the Hero's Sword.  

*Crack!*  

The thick blade shattered instantly, a broken segment plunging into the dirt.  

The Hero's Sword was peerlessly sharp, cleaving through the broadsword as if it were rotten wood before piercing the giant's chest.  

The giant's eyes dimmed as he uttered his final words with bitter resignation:  

"Not only are you strong... your weapon is also superior."  

*Thud.*  

His massive frame collapsed, crashing heavily to the ground. Blood gushed from his chest, staining the earth beneath him crimson.  

Dou Changsheng stepped forward, planting his foot on the giant's corpse as he approached the blue-robed man, who had collapsed to the ground, utterly devoid of fighting spirit.  

With a glance at Zhao Manren, Dou Changsheng caught the blue-robed man's sudden movement from the corner of his eye—like a cannonball, the man sprang up from the ground.  

But instead of attacking Dou Changsheng—a suicidal notion—he lunged toward the white horse nearby.  

The steed had slowed after Long Ying's death, now standing beside his fallen rider. The blue-robed man intended to seize the horse and escape.  

Dou Changsheng sighed.  

This reaction was entirely within his expectations.  

Because every move the enemy made had been guided by him.  

In truth, his own strength was only at the Xiantian realm—just with slightly more internal energy and a sharper sword. He didn't possess absolute overwhelming power.  

Killing them was possible, but it would have taken effort.  

Yet by understanding their weaknesses, he had crafted this awe-inspiring display.  

With the Chen Family Fort so close, the arrival of one Xiantian Zhenjing expert meant others could follow. Time was of the essence, so Dou Changsheng had chosen the quickest method.  

He had deliberately given the blue-robed man an opening. Fear had clouded the man's judgment, making escape his only thought.  

But fleeing without fighting meant his skills were reduced to less than a tenth of their usual potency—especially since his footwork was poor, a fatal flaw.  

In his panic, the blue-robed man had made a foolish choice.  

Given time to calm down, he might have surrendered the supplies and begged for mercy—or at least abandoned them to seize the horse.  

But trying to keep both the supplies and escape?  

Too greedy.  

Dou Changsheng thrust his sword.  

*Fearless Sword Art.*  

The Hero's Sword surged with Xiantian internal energy, a pure white sword qi expanding like a gust of wind, stretching over ten feet in an instant.  

The radiant blade pierced through the blue-robed man's back and out his chest, extending another foot before dissipating into nothingness.  

Blood sprayed from the man's mouth as his body crumpled.  

Zhao Manren darted forward, snatching the bundle with a swift grab before returning to Dou Changsheng's side. Without opening it, he offered it to Dou Changsheng with both hands.  

Strength was everything.  

Though Zhao Manren was part of the Mu Family's retinue and Dou Changsheng an outsider, though the mission to recover the supplies had been Zhao Manren's responsibility—  

Dou Changsheng's overwhelming power had subordinated him completely.  

The leadership of this operation now belonged to Dou Changsheng.  

Dou Changsheng pushed the bundle back. "Secure it. We leave immediately."  

"This place is too close to the Chen Family Fort."  

He strode toward the white horse, eyeing the blood dripping from its coat with mild distaste. But he suppressed it.  

No man could resist a fine steed.  

This horse was clearly priceless—not just as a mount, but as a commodity that could fund a life of luxury.  

With the Hero's Sword gifted by Tang He, all he had lacked was a noble steed.  

Now, he had both.  

The Black Eagle Venerable, who had arrived unnoticed, vaulted onto the horse without hesitation, ignoring the blood. "Brother Dou, let's move!"  

Dou Changsheng mounted the horse brought by the Black Eagle Venerable, and the three of them prepared to depart.  

But then—  

Dou Changsheng's head snapped up at the sound of distant hoofbeats.  

A group of riders was approaching. Among them was a familiar face—Feng Zhongyi.  

Before Dou Changsheng could react, Feng Zhongyi leaped from his horse and fled back toward the Chen Family Fort.  

Abandoning his steed without a second thought.  

Why?  

Because his legs were faster!
