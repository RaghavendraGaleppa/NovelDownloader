# Chapter 94: Beating Up a Foundation Establishment Cultivator

Lin Fan stepped out of the airship cabin, his demeanor triumphant and spirited, completely different from his previous disheveled state. He laughed heartily from several hundred meters in the air.

"That cost me a Minor Divine Ability Talisman—the Blazing Sky Incineration Talisman. That monk, are you dead yet?"

As soon as he finished speaking, a figure in the distance behind them staggered unsteadily, as if on the verge of collapse, yet still managed to stand firm on a pitch-black wheel, charred from the flames, and flew away into the distance.

"Uh..."

The two brothers stared blankly into the distance. He still wasn't dead? This Monk Xingtai's life was absurdly tenacious! That was a Minor Divine Ability Talisman—equivalent to a full-force strike from a Golden Core cultivator! How could Monk Xingtai, a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, withstand it?

Lin Shan turned to Lin Fan with a puzzled look. Was it because of this guy's jinxing words?

Lin Fan scratched his head awkwardly and explained, "No big deal. Zen sect cultivators focus on body refinement, so it's understandable that their defenses are exceptional. But he must be severely injured now—barely able to escape! He's practically a fish on the chopping—"

Before he could finish, the charred figure in the distance seemed to sense something. It suddenly paused mid-flight before darting away at full speed.

Lin Fan immediately shut his mouth.

Beside him, Lin Shan acted swiftly, leaping back into the airship cabin and grabbing the scorching-hot control lever. With a fierce pull, the slowly descending airship abruptly surged forward, turning sharply to pursue their fleeing target.

Monk Xingtai was in a miserable state—his eyebrows and beard completely singed off, his gray robes tattered, and the golden wheel beneath his feet now resembled a lump of scrap metal, blackened beyond recognition. 

He frantically absorbed spiritual energy from a mid-grade spirit stone while gulping down healing pills and activating recovery talismans, desperately trying to replenish the spiritual power he had exhausted resisting the divine ability. 

Meanwhile, his insides churned with excruciating pain as fire poison seeped into his organs, leaving him in the worst condition he had ever experienced. 

Seeing the airship turn around and give chase, he had no choice but to flee, terrified that the two youngsters behind him would catch up and finish him off.

On the airship, the Lin brothers were seized by fervor. A golden opportunity lay before them—a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Qi Condensation cultivators to slay a Foundation Establishment expert! How could they let Monk Xingtai escape?

Lin Shan poured all his strength into piloting the airship, its protective shield denting inward from the intense wind pressure. The wind spirit stones powering the vessel crackled with unstable energy, clearly overworked and on the verge of breaking down. 

But Lin Fan, the wealthy young master, didn't care in the slightest. He kept urging, "Faster! Even faster!" Clearly, this was a rare opportunity to brag to his fellow disciples later, and he was nearly beside himself with excitement.

Monk Xingtai eventually reached his limit. Having been severely injured at the epicenter of the Minor Divine Ability Talisman's explosion, he was now on the verge of collapse. Seeing the airship closing in, he realized that if he continued flying, he would inevitably be caught.

Gritting his teeth, he had no choice but to descend to the ground, landing in a grassy area among the mountains. He immediately sat cross-legged and erected a defensive barrier, clutching a spirit stone to begin recovering his spiritual energy.

Lin Shan swiftly maneuvered the airship down, and the two brothers disembarked. Seeing Monk Xingtai trying to buy time to recover, they wasted no words and immediately unleashed their magical artifacts.

"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"

"Zzzzt! Zzzzt!"

Lin Shan fired sword beams from his Cold Iron Sword while Lin Fan discharged lightning from his golden mace. Their attacks were fierce and relentless, but Monk Xingtai's barrier effortlessly deflected them all.

The barrier shimmered with golden light, inscribed with shifting Buddhist mantras. Every strike against it produced a dull *thud*, proving its formidable resistance to both physical and magical attacks.

After a prolonged assault, the barrier remained intact, while Monk Xingtai's breathing steadied, his complexion gradually regaining color.

"Save your efforts," the old monk said with a composed tone, despite his disheveled appearance. "This is the renowned high-tier defensive spell of my Buddhist sect—Golden Bell Shield. Your mid-tier artifacts cannot break it."

The two brothers ceased their futile attacks. Lin Shan hesitated—should he use his ancient aura to upgrade the Cold Iron Sword into a high-tier artifact? If the monk recovered his spiritual energy, they would be the ones hunted again.

But Lin Fan suddenly realized his own foolishness. For Qi Condensation cultivators, high-tier artifacts consumed too much spiritual energy, making them impractical for everyday use against peers. But their opponent was a Foundation Establishment cultivator! Ordinary mid-tier artifacts couldn't hope to break his high-tier spells.

Lin Fan rummaged through his storage pouch and pulled out a long spear. Its tip gleamed with a chilling light, its sharp aura palpable—clearly a top-quality high-tier artifact.

Monk Xingtai immediately fell silent, his heart skipping a beat.

But Lin Fan wasn't done. After another search, he retrieved a dazzling, multicolored fan. The moment it appeared, the surrounding elemental energies of heaven and earth grew restless. He tossed it to Lin Shan.

---

"Five Elements Fan!"

Not only did Lin Fan recognize it, but Lin Shan and Monk Xingtai did as well. 

This artifact was part of a set with the Five Elements Robe, capable of freely switching between all five elemental attributes—a top-tier offensive artifact among high-tier magical tools!

Monk Xingtai panicked. He frantically searched his storage pouch, only to despair upon realizing that all his defensive artifacts and talismans had been exhausted in the earlier Blazing Sky Incineration attack.

But the Lin brothers gave him no chance to recover. Strike while the enemy is weak!

Lin Shan wielded the Five Elements Fan, its radiance shifting as he unleashed a relentless barrage of elemental attacks. He swung the fan wildly, not holding back in the slightest.

Meanwhile, Lin Fan thrust his spear forward—first a flash of cold light, then the spear shot forth like a dragon.

Monk Xingtai could endure no longer. In his prime, he could have withstood two high-tier artifacts, but now, exhausted and internally injured, he couldn't hold out.

Cursing the Purple Heaven Sect for being ridiculously wealthy—even their Qi Condensation disciples carried Minor Divine Ability Talismans and high-tier artifacts like they were cabbages—he wobbled back onto his blackened wheel and took to the skies.

Staying meant certain death. Fleeing was his only option.

Behind him, the two brothers swiftly stowed their artifacts and climbed back into the airship. Lin Shan expertly pulled the lever, and the airship roared to life, propelled by wind spirit stones with an exhilarating surge of power.

In an instant, they were in pursuit once more!
