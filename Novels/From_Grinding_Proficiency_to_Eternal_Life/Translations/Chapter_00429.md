# Chapter 429: True Martial Demon-Subduing Sword Art

Xu Yunfan tore through the barrier of the Divine Martial Realm. At that instant, three shadows flashed out from behind the ruins, revealing the killing intent that had been lurking like venomous snakes for so long.

Xu Yunfan looked on coldly, showing no surprise, which made the three figures hesitate for a moment.

In the next instant, the purple-robed old man grinned ferociously, his pale teeth gleaming coldly under the dim light. With a flick of his blood banner, a thousand-zhang ghost domain instantly spread out. Howling Yin winds and the wails of ten thousand ghosts filled the air, and countless vengeful spirits transformed into black chains that wrapped around Xu Yunfan.

The purple-robed old man frowned slightly. The suppression of this world was too severe for him. If he were in the outside world, a single wave of his Ten Thousand Soul Banner could turn a hundred miles into a ghostly domain.

"Leave the Divine Martial Dao Foundation behind."

Before the words had fully faded, the purple-robed old man’s pupils constricted as he looked down at his Dantian.

A pitch-black long sword had, at some unknown moment, pierced through it. The shadow of a Xuanwu coiled around the blade, opening its mouth to suck, and the ghostly energy within the blood banner was instantly devoured like a receding tide.

"Urgh...?!"

The purple-robed old man’s face changed drastically. Before he could react, Xu Yunfan coldly pulled the sword back. With a twist of the blade, the old man’s Dantian and Qi Sea instantly shattered, his true energy dispersing like a flood released from a dam.

"I've been waiting for rats like you who try to steal Dao Foundations."

Xu Yunfan’s voice was icy cold. His innate talent, the Word of Strife, activated. Behind him, a Xuanwu manifestation with three heads and six arms appeared with a rumble. All six hands formed Demon-Subduing Seals simultaneously. In an instant, golden light blazed across the heavens and earth, and a magnificent, demon-suppressing power descended like the sky itself collapsing!

Although he concealed his true strength, he cultivated the Ten Extremities Martial Path, practiced the Return of Ten Thousand Laws, and had even refined the Xuan Tian Bao Lu. Forming a simplified version of a martial manifestation was effortless for him.

"True Martial Demon-Subduing Sword, sweep away demons and slay evil!"

The sword light was like the Milky Way hanging upside down. The tortoise and snake intertwined on the True Martial Sword. The sword intent drew upon the power of the Divine Martial Realm's heaven and earth. Limitless spiritual energy poured in, transforming into a hundred-zhang long, black-gold sword aura that slashed directly at the remaining two black-robed cultivators.

Their faces changed drastically. One summoned an ancient bronze mirror, its surface glowing with a dark light, attempting to deflect the sword aura. The other formed hand seals to draw upon the earth's veins. The ground beneath his feet churned, rising to form a thousand-zhang rock wall for defense.

However, the True Martial Demon-Subduing Sword was a lethal technique from the True Martial Demon-Subduing Sutra, and Xu Yunfan's Word of Strife talent further empowered it. Where the sword aura passed, the bronze mirror shattered with a crack, the divine reflection within vanishing, and the treasure's spiritual light breaking.

The thousand-zhang rock wall was split open like tofu. The sword energy did not lose its momentum, cutting one of the black-robed cultivators in half at the waist!

"Damn it! How can he be this strong?!"

The remaining black-robed cultivator was terrified. He retreated rapidly while throwing three blood-colored talismans from his sleeve. The talismans burned, transforming into three blood pythons that pounced at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan snorted coldly. He swung the True Martial Sword horizontally. Where the blade passed, the long sky was torn open, leaving a visible trail of white turbulence. The blood pythons were shredded by the sword intent before they could even get close.

Xu Yunfan sheathed his sword, the magic power within him flowing at an extremely low frequency. Then, he raised his sword and brought it down.

"True Martial Demon-Subduing Sword, Sever Karma!"

With this strike, the sword light descended like heavenly punishment. The black-robed cultivator's protective aura shattered like paper. In his haste, he crushed a life-saving jade talisman, his form turning into a blood shadow to escape. Yet, the sword light followed him like a shadow. A single slash caused the blood shadow to disperse. The black-robed cultivator let out a tragic cry as his physical body disintegrated, leaving only a wisp of his soul to flee in a panic.

"Trying to run?"

There was no time to check the flood of proficiency prompts appearing on the attribute panel in his vision.

A cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. The True Martial Sword flew from his hand, like a meteor chasing the moon, and in an instant, it pierced through the lingering soul, pinning it to the void!

However, at that very moment.

"Junior! You forced me!!"

The purple-robed old man's face was ferocious. Seeing Xu Yunfan kill two men in the blink of an eye, his strength far surpassing the peak of the Core Formation Great Perfection realm, and his sword strikes having power almost no different from a Foundation Establishment cultivator, it was simply inhuman.

Could it be that all cultivators of the True Martial Demon-Subduing Sutra were this terrifying?

If he didn't undo the seal, he would be finished here too. One soul scattered, unable to even reincarnate. The other was cut in half, all life force shattered. Dying in this minor heaven meant only a slim chance of entering the Dao after a hundred lifetimes of reincarnation within this Divine Martial Realm.

But by then, would he still be himself?

The purple-robed old man's flesh and blood writhed frantically. The suppressed mid-Foundation Establishment cultivation erupted with a boom!

"Heaven and earth trembled. The Dao of the Divine Martial Realm sensed the power exceeding its limit and instantly suppressed him. The old man's skin cracked inch by inch, blood pouring out, but he still desperately unfolded his Dao Foundation.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and let out a "Ha".

"So it's Elder Zhou Xing of the Five Peaks. I thought you were contemplating the principles of the Five Elements generating and overcoming each other, following the constant ways of heaven. How did you end up turning to robbery and plunder?"

Zhou Xing sneered. "Robbery and plunder? This is the basic skill of our Sacred Sect, called 'plundering others to nourish oneself'."

Xu Yunfan was speechless. He had almost forgotten. Although the Primordial Origin Sect cultivated many grand and upright sutras, their conduct was completely that of devils.

The Five Elements Dao Foundation!!

In an instant, five-colored divine light appeared behind Zhou Xing. The powers of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth intertwined, transforming into a small realm.

Xu Yunfan watched with great surprise. He couldn't underestimate these Foundation Establishment True Persons.

Relying solely on this Five Elements Dao Foundation, this Zhou Xing True Person could probably create his own grotto-heaven, unlike them who had to seek it externally. Creating a grotto-heaven naturally fit his Dao perfectly, offering immense benefits to his cultivation.

In the next moment, a sea of fire surged into the sky, golden spears tore through the air, giant trees reached for the heavens, waves of water churned, and earth and stone collapsed. As the Five Elements rotated, they briefly resisted the heavenly suppression, enveloping Xu Yunfan within!

"Junior! Today, I shall show you what true Foundation Establishment power is! To be so arrogant just after entering Foundation Establishment... I've killed plenty like you."

Zhou Xing True Person laughed maniacally. The power of his Five Elements Dao Foundation poured out wildly, intending to crush Xu Yunfan.

Although suppressed severely by this world, it should be more than enough to deal with a mere early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. In the path of immortality, every step forward is a new world. It was almost impossible to fight across realms.

Yet, Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. The Word of Strife operated frantically. He raised his hand, and the True Martial Sword, which he had already refined, was summoned back by his will in an instant. With the blade raised slightly, the Xuanwu manifestation behind him roared toward the sky, resonating with the heavens and earth of the Divine Martial Realm.

He was, after all, the one blessed with great fortune by the Dao of this world. Naturally, he wouldn't be squeezed by it. However, if he were to circulate his magic power too intensely, it might provoke a reaction from the Dao, which would be troublesome.

Simultaneously, he circulated the Turtle Breath Hiding Spirit Technique to avoid the gaze of those who intended to spy on him. For instance, these three before him. Just watching wasn't enough; they had to rush in shouting for a fight.

Xu Yunfan raised the True Martial Sword.

True Martial Demon-Subduing Sword, Final Form, True Martial Descends to the World!

A single sword strike, as if heaven and earth fell silent!

The sword light was like the first ray of dawn, piercing the darkness and illuminating the sky. The shadows of the tortoise and snake on the True Martial Sword solidified, transforming into a Xuanwu manifestation that suppressed the Five Elements!
