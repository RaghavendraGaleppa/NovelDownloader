# Chapter 7: Discovery  

Li Shiming recalled his first encounter with Chief Escort Wang in the garden—right by this very rockery. Even when Chief Escort Wang had arranged to meet him, it was always near this spot.  

If he had a valuable item in his possession and was being pursued, he wouldn’t carry it on his person. Instead, he would hide it somewhere he could keep an eye on at all times.  

Perhaps Chief Escort Wang had hidden something nearby. Li Shiming didn’t disturb the body but began searching the surrounding area.  

He knew his own experience was limited, so he wouldn’t be able to spot anything unusual with just his eyes.  

Then he thought of the IBM z15 mainframe server in his data center space. But first, he needed to ensure that whatever his eyes saw could be directly recorded by the server.  

To enable visual input, he had to configure his eyes as an input device for the IBM z15.  

He accessed the Linux system settings and attempted to add an input device. Connecting his consciousness to the input module, the system promptly detected an available device.  

No driver installation was needed—the device automatically configured itself.  

This was the first time Li Shiming had operated the IBM z15 by delving into its internal components. After several attempts, he successfully registered his eyes as a valid input device for the server.  

He scanned the area around the rockery with his eyes, recording the surroundings into the IBM z15 as a video file.  

Then, he closed his eyes and replayed the recorded footage repeatedly in his mind.  

Though his experience was limited, after nearly a hundred replays, he finally noticed something unusual.  

"Found it!"  

After over a minute of intense scrutiny, he spotted the anomaly.  

Li Shiming moved to the southern corner of the rockery. The grass here looked identical to the rest, but upon closer inspection—or rather, after digital analysis by the IBM z15—it was slightly taller on average.  

This minute difference was imperceptible to the naked eye, but the server’s data processing highlighted it clearly.  

The entire process had drained the IBM z15’s power to critical levels in just one minute.  

Chief Escort Wang had hidden his belongings skillfully. Without the computational power of the IBM z15, Li Shiming would never have found it.  

Carefully, Li Shiming lifted the patch of grass, revealing a wooden box beneath.  

His heart raced with excitement as he opened it. Inside were two books and a small wooden sword.  

---  

The wooden sword was covered in intricate patterns, so finely crafted they rivaled the precision of printed designs from his past life.  

He picked it up and was surprised by its weight—nearly eight pounds.  

"This isn’t an ordinary sword. It might be an artifact of cultivation!" The weight alone confirmed its extraordinary nature.  

He tucked the sword into his robes before examining the books.  

*"Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique"* and *"Introduction to Runes"*—these were their titles.  

After skimming through them, he hesitated, then placed them back in the box.  

A thought struck him: Chief Escort Wang was dead, but the cultivator hunting him wasn’t. The investigation would continue.  

He didn’t know what methods the cultivator might use to track the box. To be safe, he needed to create a decoy—something to make it seem like the box had only ever contained the books.  

Since he had already recorded the books in the IBM z15, he could review them anytime.  

With the books stored, the server’s power dropped to hibernation levels. Without recharging the UPS, it wouldn’t be usable for a while.  

After carefully restoring the grass to its original state, he moved Chief Escort Wang’s body into the data center space.  

Admittedly, he didn’t want to do this, but leaving the body in the garden was worse.  

He meticulously erased all traces of the struggle, especially around where Chief Escort Wang had fallen.  

Only then did he return to his courtyard, feeling a weight lift from his shoulders.  

That night, before bed, he used his consciousness to power the generator until exhaustion claimed him.  

---  

The next day passed uneventfully. The authorities hadn’t found the cultivator, let alone Chief Escort Wang.  

But on the second night, the sound of urgent drums echoed through Nanling Prefecture—a signal of grave danger.  

Li Shiming rushed out and met his servant, Moyan, who delivered grim news.  

"Young Master, it’s terrible! The Wei Yuan Escort Agency has been wiped out. Chief Escort Wang and his entire household—all thirty-five people—were slaughtered!"  

Li Shiming’s face paled. There was no doubt—this was the cultivator’s doing.  

Perhaps, unable to find Chief Escort Wang, the cultivator had resorted to this.  

By exterminating the entire escort agency and Wang’s family, the cultivator hoped to force him out of hiding.  

But the brutality was staggering. Thirty-five lives, extinguished just like that.  

This was Nanling Prefecture—no wonder the alarm drums had sounded. By now, not only the prefectural soldiers but even nearby military forces would be mobilizing.  

Li Shiming grew even more anxious. The item the cultivator sought was hidden in the garden. He couldn’t guarantee the cultivator would be satisfied with just the box.  

The wooden sword inside had been taken by him. If that was the cultivator’s true target, his household could be in grave danger.  

He doubted the local authorities could stand against a cultivator. Most likely, they were powerless.  

He needed an extra layer of protection before the cultivator found the box.  

"Moyan, are the materials I requested ready?" Li Shiming asked urgently.  

"I’ll hurry them along. They’ll be here by tomorrow morning!" Moyan assured him.  

Originally, Li Shiming had planned to build an electric arc furnace. With it, he could craft precise metal tools for self-defense.  

But time was against him. The materials wouldn’t arrive soon enough, and the UPS lacked sufficient power reserves.  

A new idea struck him.  

Inside the data center space, he conducted a chemical experiment, producing a small amount of white phosphorus.  

With the IBM z15’s vast database, he had over a dozen methods to synthesize it. He chose the fastest available.  

Armed with the white phosphorus, he returned to the garden and placed some chemicals inside the wooden box.  

After meticulously covering his tracks, he had done all he could.  

Now, it was up to fate.
