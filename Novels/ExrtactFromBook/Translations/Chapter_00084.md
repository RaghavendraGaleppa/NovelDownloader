# Chapter 84: Golden Blade Gorge

After speaking, Li Changle waved his hand and transmitted a beam of magical light directly into Han Yue's inheritance stele. 

This valuable secret technique, *Summoning Thunder*, was now his! 

Han Yue had gained another cultivation subject to study. 

The two conversed for a while longer before Han Yue returned to his cave abode. 

Now, Han Yue only needed to thoroughly research and comprehend the *Summoning Thunder* technique before he could descend the mountain for his training journey. 

He set himself a goal—to master this technique within one month. 

After repeatedly reading *The Divine Thunder Palace Chronicles: Records of the Jade Sky Realm*, Han Yue had already developed boundless fascination for this magnificent world. 

Restlessness stirred within him—he longed to descend the mountain and explore its wonders!

According to *The Chronicles*, the Jade Sky Realm was divided into the Outer Territories, Inner Territories, and Oceanic Territories. 

This geographical compendium prepared by the Divine Thunder Palace for its disciples was extraordinarily detailed. 

Among these three regions, the Outer Territories—Han Yue's quasi-homeland—were extremely resource-rich but strictly forbidden to human cultivators, being jointly ruled by [Great Demon Saints]. 

Countless powerful demons thrived there, herding vast numbers of humans as livestock. 

The Oceanic Territories' area surpassed the other two combined. 

Innumerable islands dotted these waters, sharing the oceanic civilization with marine demons. 

They were governed by a coalition of [Ocean Kings]—aquatic beings of Longevity Realm and above. 

However, *The Chronicles* devoted most of its pages to the Inner Territories, entirely controlled by humankind. 

Through his reading, Han Yue learned that each of the Inner Territories' five continents possessed drastically different geographical features. 

Moreover, each continent endured an ancient [Dao-Blocking Calamity] that had consumed countless human lives over millennia. 

Cassia Continent was a land of towering mountains, treacherous jungles, and demons everywhere. Guarded by two fourth-rank sects—[Beast Taming Sect] and [Azure Lotus Sword Sect]—it resisted the [Demon Calamity]. 

Sea Continent had numerous rivers and lakes, its so-called land being nothing but scattered islands. Protected by the fifth-rank [Penglai Sect] and fourth-rank [Longevity Valley], it withstood the [Flood Calamity]. 

Southern Bamboo Continent was a realm of swamps, miasmas, endless wetlands, basins, and rainforests—exceptionally humid and sweltering. 

Two fourth-rank sects—[Five Bamboo Sect] and [Dharma Blossom Alchemy Sect]—guarded it against the horrific [Poison Calamity], resisting infinite venomous creatures and deadly flora. 

Central Continent was a paradise—the most naturally hospitable region for humans. 

Vast and blessed with pleasant climate and fertile plains, it supported nearly half of Jade Sky Realm's population. 

Three fifth-rank sects—[Profound Gravity Sect], [Jade Purity Gate], and [Grand Mystery Sect]—gathered here to protect this sacred human land. 

Yet Central Continent suffered the most terrifying Dao-Blocking Calamity of all—the [Extradimensional Demon Tribulation], or simply [Demon Tribulation]. 

As for Reed Continent where Divine Thunder Palace resided, it endured the extremely harsh [Heavenly Calamity Tribulation]. 

Not only was most of this continent's topography bizarre—with vast lifeless zones—but terrifying natural disasters also plagued its entirety. 

*The Chronicles* contained a complete sand table of Reed Continent. When Han Yue first saw it, he was stunned by its geography. 

Reed Continent actually consisted of three enormous stacked landmasses, each separated by tens of thousands of meters in elevation. 

These massive height differences isolated each layer, making them almost independent worlds. 

The Celestial Passage River originating from Divine Thunder Palace flowed southward through Reed Continent's first layer—[Golden Blade Gorge]. 

This entire stratum was an immense metallic plate where over ninety percent of the ground was metal, much of it valuable ranked materials. 

Almost no vegetation grew here, depriving humans and animals of sustenance. 

Moreover, one of the deadly disasters here was [Earth's Pull]—the chaotic properties of various ranked metals created wildly uneven gravity distribution across the gorge. 

Gravity here ranged from twice to hundreds of times normal, with no visible indicators between zones. 

Careless travelers who stumbled into high-gravity traps would be pinned helplessly, even ranked cultivators slowly perishing under the crushing force. 

Additionally, the metallic landmass attracted massive thunderstorm systems, frequently spawning continent-spanning supercell storms. 

Golden Blade Gorge's metallic composition allowed lightning to spread rapidly across the ground, annihilating all life—creating another disaster: [Lightning Hell]. 

The Celestial Passage River traversed the entire gorge before plunging tens of thousands of meters at the boundary with the second layer, forming the Golden Blade Waterfall. 

From afar, this ten-kilometer cascade reflected sunlight like a golden blade stabbing into the earth's heart. 

Over centuries, the waterfall's erosion formed Golden Blade Lake on the second layer, around which Reed Continent's first human settlement emerged. 

Three cities—Metal Devouring City, Iron Eating City, and Mountain Burning City—housed several million people, nearly the entire second layer's population. 

This stratum was called [Flame Mountains], riddled with countless active volcanoes connecting to the planet's toxic magma veins—the [Mountain Incineration] disaster. 

Superheated lava blanketed the land, melting metal and stone alike, while volcanic gases poisoned air and water. 

Living conditions here were even worse than Golden Blade Gorge. 

As the Celestial Passage River flowed through the Flame Mountains, it heated into a toxic boiling river hundreds of miles wide—the [Scalding River] disaster. 

This boiling current eventually descended to Reed Continent's third layer—[Wind-Shelter Plain], an endless sandy wasteland battered by catastrophic storms. 

These [Wind Calamities] matched the deadliness of Golden Blade Gorge and Flame Mountains' disasters, rendering over ninety percent of the plain uninhabitable. 

Yet the desert's ultra-fine diamond sand proved an excellent natural filter. 

The boiling river gradually cooled as it crossed the desert, its toxic elements and metals slowly purified over thousands of miles. 

By Reed Continent's southern edge, the river slowed into a fertile basin—the third human settlement with near-Central Continent habitability. 

Golden Blade Gorge, Flame Mountains, and Wind-Shelter Plain were Reed Continent's three infamous death zones. 

Earth's Pull, Lightning Hell, Mountain Incineration, Scalding River, and Wind Calamity—these disasters stifled human development here. 

Yet for powerful cultivators, Reed Continent offered unparalleled tempering of will and cultivation. 

Many foreign cultivators came specifically to challenge these calamities and test their limits. 

And this was precisely where Han Yue's training journey would begin!
