# Chapter 51: Harvest Season

During this period, Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang next door didn't question Chu Ning again about Qi Chongmao. Moreover, Chu Ning no longer felt the same sense of being watched as when Qi Chongmao had lived nearby. 

This suggested one of two possibilities: either they found nothing noteworthy about him, or while Qi Chongmao had practiced the Divine Refinement Technique, they hadn't. Chu Ning leaned toward the latter, as when he'd extended his divine sense toward their residence during his own practice, they'd shown no reaction. 

Regardless, Chu Ning remained vigilant. He rarely ventured out, spending most days shuttling between his spirit fields and his courtyard. Even at night, he kept talismans and his black wooden sword at hand—the talismans for immediate use, and the sword, though limited to linear attacks, as a defensive measure. 

Most of his time was spent in the Ink Spirit Bamboo field, where he practiced the Evergreen Wood Technique to strengthen his foundation in the Wood Attribute Longevity Art. He also continued with the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art and the Divine Refinement Technique. 

The former progressed steadily, but the latter surprised him. Before condensing his divine sense into liquid form, despite his innate aptitude, he could only gain one proficiency point every two days—the slowest progress he'd experienced since beginning cultivation. He'd assumed mastery would take considerable time. 

Yet after that breakthrough, practicing twice daily now yielded one point per day. Moreover, he woke each morning feeling refreshed, free from the mental fatigue he'd expected. The technique's efficacy far exceeded his expectations. 

As for spells, Chu Ning invested little effort. After realizing the Golden Sword Technique offered diminishing returns, he abandoned it entirely. However, after demonstrating his Thorn Technique at the Transmission Hall, he acquired another mid-tier Wood Attribute attack spell: Earth Spike. When combined with thorns, it proved effective. 

Still, Chu Ning felt his offensive capabilities were lacking. Inspired by Luo and Lu's earlier message transmission, he also learned the Voice Transmission Technique. Other basic Wood spells he'd mastered to instant-cast proficiency required minimal practice. 

In spare moments, he refined his Fireball Technique. Without the Wood Spirit Body's enhancement, progress was slower, but repetition improved his control. 

Two months passed without visiting the market. The matter of purchasing talisman paper for Mu Ling seemed forgotten, and if questioned, he'd claim to have stockpiled supplies earlier. 

Harvest season arrived swiftly. The shorter-maturing Purple Spirit Grass had been gathered over a month prior—simpler than spirit rice, requiring only uprooting. With no personal use for it, Chu Ning surrendered half to the sect and exchanged the remainder for twenty spirit stones through Zhuang Yunde—a slightly poorer yield than rice, attributable to colder weather limiting crop options. 

But Chu Ning cared little. His true income came from premium-grade Ink Spirit Bamboo and the talisman paper crafted from it. 

Standing before the bamboo field, he smiled. Last season, to conceal his cultivation speed, he'd moderated his Evergreen Wood Technique's application on bamboo destined for the sect. Now, having arranged to compensate with paper, he'd cultivated this batch to peak quality from day one with perfected, instant-cast techniques. 

Previously, he'd produced 4,800 and 6,000 sheets from two bamboo types. Now, though untested, he confidently anticipated exceeding 12,000. 

Harvesting with Blade Wind Technique took merely two days—his improved cultivation and spell mastery accelerating the process. Back home, paper production proceeded smoothly. Experience and his Talisman Source Spirit Body boosted his success rate from 85% to 95%, yielding astonishing results. 

"Fifteen thousand sheets," Chu Ning murmured, storing the stacks in his spatial pouch. After deducting 3,500 for the sect and 600 for Zhuang Yunde, he retained 10,900—100 more than last season's pre-tax total. 

To Zhuang Yunde, he'd report only 8,000, a plausible 2,500 increase. "Selling Mu Ling 1,500 monthly should be manageable," he mused, heading out to deliver the news—and to declare his intent to test for promotion to Zone C. 

After all, he was now officially a "fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator."
