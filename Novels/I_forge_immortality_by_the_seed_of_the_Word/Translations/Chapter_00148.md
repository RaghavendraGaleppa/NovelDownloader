# Chapter 145: Senior Brother of the Nine Domains Lineage

In the blink of an eye,  
Zhang Jing's accumulated fortune had dwindled to just three hundred thousand.  

He gazed at the three hundred sixty-five foundational Dao Intentions displayed before him, noting that even the cheapest among them required five hundred fifty thousand units of fortune. Originally, he had planned to exchange for several Dao Intentions, but with his fortune running critically low, Zhang Jing had no choice but to abandon the idea and return in a year.  

As for selecting cheaper Dao Intentions to fuse into his Primordial Dao Foundation—  

He wasn't that reckless.  

The Primordial Dao Foundation was of utmost importance, directly influencing his future path in the Dao. Zhang Jing wasn't willing to take such risks.  

In fact,  
he didn't even intend to directly fuse these three hundred sixty-five foundational Dao Intentions into his Primordial Dao Foundation.  

After all, doing so would completely waste the jade talisman's ability to merge Dao Intentions and Dharma Seeds.  

"In a few years, once I've accumulated enough fortune, I'll purchase a Daoist scripture from the Dao Treasury Secret Realm—a cultivation method with the potential to accommodate all Dao Intentions—and upgrade it into a Dharma Seed."  

"Then, I'll fuse all the fully comprehended Dao Intentions into this Dharma Seed. That should allow me to refine a 'Dao Seed' capable of manifesting the principles of the World Creation Path."  

A faint smile appeared at the corner of Zhang Jing's mouth as he contemplated this.  

"In a way, I'm forging a new path within the framework of the World Creation Path—though it's one others would find difficult to replicate."  

Barring any unforeseen circumstances,  
the innate divine ability he would awaken upon advancing from the Foundation Establishment Realm to the Golden Core Divine Ability Realm might surpass even the Primordial Radiance Great Divine Ability!  

As for whether he could find a legacy capable of accommodating multiple Dao Intentions—  

Zhang Jing wasn't overly concerned.  

If he truly couldn't find one, he could always slowly merge Dharma Seeds. Eventually, a sufficiently powerful Dharma Seed capable of containing all Dao Intentions would emerge.  

It would simply take more time.  

In truth, Zhang Jing was well aware that the Dao Origin Auspicious Clouds might be the most suitable Dharma Seed for fusing multiple Dao Intentions.  

Its potential was vast enough.  

However, this Dharma Seed was crucial for comprehending Dao Intentions and upgrading various legacies, so he dared not tamper with it recklessly.  

Returning to the present,  
Zhang Jing rose to leave.  

Yet in the next moment,  
his footsteps abruptly halted.  

There was one more matter he had nearly forgotten.  

Once again, his mind effortlessly connected to the Dao Treasury Secret Realm.  

In an instant,  
a massive star radiating nine-colored light pushed aside the other celestial bodies and slowly drifted before Zhang Jing.  

**[Nine-Colored Divine Light — 1.9 billion units of fortune]**  

The information entered his vision.  

Zhang Jing rubbed his eyes, half-convinced he must be seeing things.  

After scrutinizing it several more times,  
he finally confirmed it wasn't a mistake on his part—the Dao Treasury Secret Realm's pricing was indeed that exorbitant.  

1.9 billion units of fortune!  

"Senior Brother Feng Wuyu actually expects me to help Lu Thirty-Eight exchange for this legacy? He really overestimates me."  

Zhang Jing felt utterly speechless.  

With such an astronomical fortune required, how many years would it take him to accumulate enough?  

Without hesitation,  
Zhang Jing turned and left the Dao Treasury Secret Realm.  

As for Lu Thirty-Eight's legacy, that would have to wait.  

This master truly lacked the means to help!

**Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven**  

At the center of a celestial island, within a simple palace,  
Zhang Jing sat cross-legged in meditation.  

After an indeterminate amount of time,  
his eyes abruptly snapped open.  

In his hand now rested a Dao talisman forged from an unknown metallic stone, no larger than half a palm. Its surface was covered in crimson patterns faintly outlining the form of a three-legged divine crow spreading its wings as if to take flight.  

And upon the crow's back  
was a blazing crimson sun.  

Waves of scorching heat radiated outward in all directions.  

The temperature within the palace began to soar wildly, and within moments, the scent of something burning filled the air.  

Witnessing this,  
a trace of astonishment flickered across Zhang Jing's face.  

"So this is the Golden Sun Crimson Crow Dao Intention? Even merely recorded on this metallic talisman, it can manifest such power."  

His divine sense cautiously extended toward the talisman.  

Yet in the next instant,  
a booming voice resounded across the entire island.  

"Hahaha, is Junior Brother Zhang Jing present? Might you come out and meet us?"  

"Visitors? From the Lower Realm Nine Domains lineage?"  

Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed thoughtfully before he flipped his hand, causing the metallic talisman recording the Golden Sun Crimson Crow Dao Intention to vanish.  

Before long,  
Zhang Jing led a group of three individuals to the simple palace at the island's center.  

"A spirit spring?"  

The golden-robed middle-aged Daoist at the forefront exclaimed in surprise upon spotting the mist-shrouded, immortal-qi-infused lake beside the palace.  

His words immediately drew the attention of the other two Daoists, who turned to gaze at the lake.  

In the next moment,  
their faces simultaneously revealed undisguised envy.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, you actually encountered a spirit spring while establishing your celestial island? Such a once-in-a-millennium stroke of luck actually happened to you?"  

The golden-robed Daoist's voice carried a complex undertone.  

"Junior Brother, what incredible fortune!"  

"Ah, to speak truthfully, I originally intended to establish my celestial island in this very spot, but a senior brother persuaded me to choose another location. How I regret that decision now!"  

The other two Daoists chimed in immediately.  

Particularly the white-robed Daoist with a golden mystical mark between his eyebrows—he clutched his chest in exaggerated regret, looking as though he wanted to beat himself up.  

Observing this,  
an odd expression surfaced on Zhang Jing's face as he asked,  

"Senior Brother Qing, might I ask which senior brother advised you to change locations?"  

The moment the words left his mouth,  
the white-robed, golden-marked Daoist referred to as 'Senior Brother Qing' instinctively glanced skyward before answering respectfully,  

"Naturally, it was True Transmission Senior Brother Feng Wuyu."  

Hearing this,  
the peculiar look on Zhang Jing's face intensified.  

He had originally planned to explain that the spirit spring was a gift from Senior Brother Feng, but now it seemed wiser to keep that detail to himself.  

Meanwhile,  
misinterpreting Zhang Jing's expression,  

the leading golden-robed Daoist assumed his junior brother had merely stumbled upon the spirit spring by chance while establishing his island and, being new to the grotto-heaven, was unaware of its true value.  

Thus, he earnestly advised,  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, the immortal qi within this spirit spring is refined by the grotto-heaven from the chaos of the void—it's the purest essence imaginable. Whether used for cultivation or nurturing spiritual roots and immortal plants, it's an unparalleled treasure. You must value it highly."  

Seemingly feeling this wasn't emphatic enough,  

the golden-robed Daoist pondered briefly before adding,  

"From what this senior brother knows, nearly all spirit springs within our Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven are currently in the possession of the eight Harmony Dao True Transmission disciples. Among us registered disciples, even including your spirit spring, fewer than three possess one."  

"Many thanks for Senior Brother's guidance. This junior understands now."  

A flash of surprise crossed Zhang Jing's eyes before he replied calmly.  

From this perspective, the debt he owed Senior Brother Feng Wuyu was even greater than he had imagined.  

Debts of gratitude were the hardest to repay!  

Zhang Jing sighed inwardly,  

yet an inexplicable sense of gratitude welled up within him.  

---  

Within the palace's reception hall,  

Zhang Jing politely served immortal tea to his three senior brothers.  

Accepting the tea, the golden-robed leader smiled and said,  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, our visit today represents all fellow disciples of the Lower Realm Nine Domains lineage within the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven. We've come to present congratulatory gifts, celebrating your status as a registered disciple of the True Monarch and your assured path to immortality."  

As he spoke,  

a small, peculiar spring—no larger than a baby's fist—materialized in the golden-robed Daoist's palm.  

Though lacking any visible source,  

this spring continuously gushed forth azure water, emitting waves of extraordinarily rich life energy.  

Moreover,  

the moment the azure water touched the ground, it vanished without a trace.  

The sight was profoundly mystical.  

"This is the Longevity-Restoring Spring. Please accept it, Junior Brother."
