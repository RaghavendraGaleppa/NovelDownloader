# Chapter 114: Stunning Skill

Within the sect, the true disciples of each hall were inherently rivals. Moreover, Qi Huan had openly declared he would seize one of the true disciple seats from the Forging Hall.

Who could accept that?

If someone actually managed to take a seat, wouldn't the Forging Hall become a laughingstock?

Seeing Xu Yunfan standing calmly, holding the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, Qi Huan no longer hesitated. The tendons in his hind legs contracted violently, and the blue brick ground cracked in a spiderweb pattern.

Simultaneously, he slapped the sword chest. The refined steel case split open, revealing six swords of varying lengths.

Qi Huan pressed down lightly, and his body shot forward like an arrow leaving a bow. The sound of air tearing pierced the air as he drew a three-foot-six-inch sword, turning into a stream of light aimed directly at Xu Yunfan's throat.

Before the blade reached him, the air compressed at the edge of the edge had already sliced through falling locust leaves three zhang away.

The Nine Skies Sect messenger looked on with a hint of appreciation.

"Qi Huan originally competed for the entry名额 to the mountain. Although he missed the top five by two spots, his swordsmanship is quite stunning."

He turned to look at the bored-looking youth standing beside him.

"Watch closely. Heroes emerge endlessly under the heavens. Although the Heavenly Cave Cave specializes in mechanisms and forging weapons, the martial arts they cultivate cannot be underestimated and have their own unique points."

The youth looked somewhat helpless. "I understand, Master."

In the arena, Xu Yunfan twisted his waist and hips sharply. The knot-like trapezius muscles swelled, tearing the clothes on his body.

The incredibly heavy hammer head scraped past the spine of the sword. As the hammer handle rubbed against his palm, fueled by surging vital energy, wisps of molten silk-like threads began to flow on the handle.

Nine meteorite iron beads hidden inside the hammer body, driven by the cloak hammer technique and centrifugal force, suddenly burst forth with a tiger-like roar.

Qi Huan's eyes blazed. He could naturally feel the terrifying power of this hammer strike.

He retracted the blade in the blink of an eye. Blue-black veins bulged on Qi Huan's deltoids. The unique high-frequency thrusts of the Thousand Waves Sword Technique turned into sixteen cold stars. The friction between the sword spine and the air actually caused it to turn dark red. The tip of the sword precisely landed on a single point of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer's head.

Amidst the scorching sparks, it actually managed to neutralize the immense force of the hammer blow.

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. He didn't expect Qi Huan's sword technique to be so remarkable, like waves surging upon waves. It truly deserved to be called the head disciple of the Hidden Blade Pavilion and the top talent of the younger generation in the Heavenly Cave Cave.

The two moved with lightning speed, hammer and sword clashing.

Qi Huan naturally dared not use his long sword to clash head-on with the heavy hammer. Not to mention this was a treasure artifact; hammer-type weapons are inherently heavy and powerful in every move. How could a three-foot sword withstand it head-on?

Therefore, he mostly used the Thousand Waves style, using high-frequency sword swings to offset the opponent's heavy attacks.

Xu Yunfan let out a soft shout. The brachioradialis muscles in his arms tightened like steel cables. The third move of the Thirty-Six Cloak Hammer Technique, "Mountain Splitting Style," combined with the inertia accumulated from the previous fifteen strikes, slammed down violently.

The moment the hammer and sword collided, sparks erupted like a fan-shaped shower of light at the edge of the blade and the hammer face.

Qi Huan's vital energy surged upwards, his face turning red. The tiger's mouth of his sword-wielding hand tore instantly, but he used the tremendous force of the hammer blow to spin and dissipate the force. His deerskin combat boots plowed a seven-foot trench in the ground.

The long sword in his hand, under such intense attacks, shattered with a crisp sound.

Xu Yunfan's right arm's large vein bulged like a python. The airflow generated by the hammer head swinging back shook the weapon racks three zhang away.

The dark and bright color of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer turned a faint red, and faint arcs of electricity could be seen.

Xu Yunfan rested the heavy hammer on his shoulder, looking at Qi Huan with a smile.

"Senior Brother Qi, I thank you for your concession."

Qi Huan suddenly smiled. "Junior Brother, do you know what my Heavenly Cave Cave specializes in?"

As he spoke, he drew from his waist. A soft sword shimmering with the light of a silver dragon appeared in his hand. Faintly, a dragon's roar seemed to come from the sword spine, and the scale patterns on the sword body emitted a cyan cold light.

On the high platform, Zhan Yan stood up abruptly, showing a hint of surprise. He turned to look at the calm-looking master of the Hidden Blade Pavilion, Bao Yan.

"Hidden Blade Pavilion's treasure artifact, the Azure Dragon Mirage. Master Bao is quite generous."

Bao Yan grinned. "Qi Huan is my Hidden Blade's true disciple. It is only right for him to have a treasure artifact to protect himself."

The viewing seats erupted in a series of gasps. Ranked fifth among the seven secret treasure artifacts of the Heavenly Cave Cave's Hidden Blade Pavilion, it was now in Qi Huan's hand, spitting cold light.

Seeing this, although Xu Yunfan was surprised, he felt more helpless.

"Senior Brother Qi, if you insist on this, I'm afraid I might use too much force later and won't be able to hold back, injuring you."

Who could stand for such words? Qi Huan found it exceptionally grating and couldn't help but snort coldly.

"Let's see you try."

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in his hand shook, suddenly emitting a humming sound. The lightning patterns on the hammer face lit up one after another.

His entire body's muscles and bones exploded with sounds like frying beans. His originally bronze skin actually began to shimmer with a golden luster between the muscle fibers. The blood lines cultivated by the Cicada Silk Technique surfaced on his skin.

"Golden Jade Knocking the Gate?! Skin Tempering Perfection?!"

A sound of a tea cup shattering came from the west side of the spectator stands.

The elderly man in the green robe held the purple clay pot, which fell and shattered. His expression was one of disbelief. "The Heavenly Cave Cave hides its strength well. There's actually a Skin Tempering Perfection... No wonder they're holding a True Disciple Ceremony."

Next to the Nine Skies Sect, the somewhat lazy youth suddenly became a bit more serious.

On the main table of the high platform, Hong Baichuan, who was sitting upright, straightened his back and opened his eyes.

He glanced at Zhan Yan, whose face was about to break into a wide smile.

"I didn't expect you old fellow to hide something so deep."

Bao Yan of the Hidden Blade Pavilion on the side stared with wide eyes, repeatedly shouting, "Impossible!"

He didn't even notice the porcelain cup in his hand being crushed, tea spilling all over the ground.

"How is that possible?!"

Qi Huan, seeing the strange phenomenon on Xu Yunfan's body, suddenly recalled the time when he fought for the entry名额 to the mountain. The top five were all experts who had perfected one of Muscle, Bone, or Skin.

One hand had suppressed him.

That deep sense of powerlessness turned into rage, churning in his chest.

"I don't believe it!"

Qi Huan's face twisted. The silver dragon in his hand had already turned into a shower of light.

The ultimate move of the Thousand Waves Sword Technique, "Hundred Rivers Returning to the Sea," generated sword winds that pressed the torches at the four corners of the training ground flat against the ground.

The long sword fell like a stream of light. The man followed the sword, instantly closing in on Xu Yunfan.

But the tip of the sword, which should have pierced through iron armor, struck Xu Yunfan's throat and produced a sound like metal clashing.

Xu Yunfan's body flared with golden light. The knot-like latissimus dorsi muscles suddenly tore the linen clothes into fragments.

The heavy hammer had unknowingly blocked in front of Xu Yunfan. Qi Huan's ultimate sword strike landed on the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, yet it couldn't even move the heavy hammer a fraction.

In the moment Qi Huan was stunned, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, wrapped in a red whirlwind, slammed down. Before the hammer even reached him, the surging force had already crushed Qi Huan's hair-binding iron crown into dust.

"Clang!"

The Azure Dragon Mirage sword body bent into a startling arc. The nine-forged tungsten steel sword spine showed spiderweb cracks. The sword energy bursting from the long sword scattered in all directions, blasting small holes into the surrounding blue bricks.

Qi Huan's sleeves on both arms exploded into strips of cloth. The muscles on his forearms twitched uncontrollably.

Xu Yunfan let out a muffled thunder from his throat. When the hammer's momentum reached its limit, he suddenly changed into a killing move of the Thirty-Six Cloak Hammer Technique.

"Reversing the Heavenly River."

Clang!

The sound of metal and iron clashing suddenly exploded!
