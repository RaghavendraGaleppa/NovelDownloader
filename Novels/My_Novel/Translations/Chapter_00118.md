Chapter 118: Fetal Shape Revealed, Opening the Furnace to Refine Pills

Under the moonlight, Madam Wen admired the flowers in her courtyard. A "Spring-Keeping Tree" grew there, adorned with yellow blossoms, exuding a delicate and watery charm. The grass and flowers beneath the tree flourished, full of vitality.

Moonlight poured down like water onto the tree trunk. A gentle breeze blew, swaying the flowering branches, creating a scene of quiet beauty with a unique atmosphere.

This Spring-Keeping Tree was no ordinary species; it could even be classified as a "Treasure Spirit." If one cut out its heart and stewed it, it would produce a pot of essence soup. Consuming it would greatly benefit one's cultivation.

Besides that, it had another use: keeping spring.

Within a one-mile radius of this tree, spring remained eternal. No matter how stormy, scorching, or freezing it was outside, the area around the Spring-Keeping Tree was always vibrant as spring.

The inner courtyard wasn't just four seasons like spring; it was four seasons *of* spring.

Madam Wen used the flowers from the tree to steep fine wine, producing a pot of "Spring Fragrance Wine." The Sword-Breaking Madam mastered many Dao arts, some profound, some shallow. Among them, her brewing method was quite formidable. Among the many industries under the One-Union Manor, the "Wine Trade" was a major pillar, one of her methods for gathering gold.

Martial Dao and martial methods... contain the philosophy of heaven and earth. People have a thousand faces, and martial arts have a thousand faces. Martial techniques often contain many insights into the Dao.

Those who become masters must inevitably be widely versed.

Madam Wen took a sip of wine. The aroma of wine mixed with floral fragrance lingered long between her lips and teeth.

Her gaze fell upon the two swords on the ground, entangled with each other.

"This sword technique is worthy of being a superior art. When combined, the swords exude a continuous affection that invites contemplation. That boy's appearance is not ordinary. If he had been born into a prestigious family and met me in my youth, promoted by this sword technique, it might have become a beautiful tale."

Madam Wen sneered: "Who is the Sword-Breaking Madam now? How could I be easily moved by emotion, especially by a mere youth. But if this boy's sword technique improves further, continuing to practice with him would be beneficial to me as well."

"It would be a shame to let such a good sword technique go to waste."

She flicked her sleeve, and the two long swords snapped into several segments, burying themselves deep in the soil.

[Mastery: 806/3000 to Proficiency]

"The combined power of these twin swords is truly formidable."
"In just one night, the mastery increased so rapidly. If I were to practice for longer, the results would be unimaginable."

On the way back to the residence, the burning sensation Li Xian had been enduring for a long time finally faded. Feeling completely relaxed, his mood was naturally excellent.

His swordsmanship had improved significantly.

It was already early summer. However, at night, the temperature was cool and pleasant. Although the manor's walls were high, they couldn't block the refreshing breeze, which invigorated the spirit as it brushed against one's body.

Li Xian passed by a lake and saw that the swimming fish hadn't gone to sleep yet. They were poking their heads out, blowing bubbles, and admiring the moonlight. He suddenly felt playful.

He bent down and gently played with the water with his palm.

His hand movements weren't large, but each gentle ripple caused the lake waves to surge, the water growing increasingly turbulent. Li Xian was using the "Green Silk Palm." The palm force struck the water and spread along the liquid, creating this scene.

Li Xian reached out to catch a fish. The fish fled towards the depths of the lake. Li Xian laughed, "Trying to run?" He rotated his hands, forming a water vortex that sucked the fish over.

The poor fish was spun until it saw stars.

"Playing around is fine, but this is going too far." Li Xian hurriedly retracted his hand. These fish in the lake were unknown species; it would be terrible if he played them to death.

He wiped his hands dry and casually plucked a reed from the lakeside. He stuck it in his mouth and strode towards the courtyard. At this moment, he didn't look like a commander or a mature older brother, but just a cheerful youth.

He increasingly realized that martial arts are taken from the heavens and earth and returned to them. Martial artists capture sparks of inspiration from all things in heaven and earth, then create martial arts.

But martial arts aren't just for fighting enemies; they are also for interacting with the heavens and earth...

Li Xian's Green Wave Palm has powerful force, and his wave-parting skill is also excellent.

It makes for a good swimming technique as well.

[You consumed 'Essence Soup of the Extreme Water Carp', Skill: Consumption, Mastery +57]
[You consumed low-grade essence meat, Skill: Consumption, Mastery +87]

A pot of essence soup was boiled every ten days or so, at most twenty days.

On this day, the Madam ordered the cauldron to be set up again. Li Xian acted swiftly and decisively, controlling the process of boiling the essence soup. This time, the boiling was very fast; it started in the morning and was completed by evening.

The cultivation of a martial artist is truly cruel.

Charcoal, cauldron, and water are crucial. Li Xian had once asked the Madam how long it would take to cook the lowest grade "essence meat" using firewood, water, and a pot.

Madam Wen scolded him for talking nonsense and having wild ideas. But then she thought about it; at his age, it's natural to be curious about all things. Since there was nothing important to do at the moment, she casually answered him. According to her knowledge, it would take at least a month.

Keeping the fire going continuously for a month, adding water constantly, the iron pot would surely burn out and need to be replaced repeatedly...

The iron pots used by common people are fine for daily cooking, but they can't withstand prolonged intense burning; they would break after a few hours.

The manpower, material resources, and energy consumed during this period, a whole month's time, could only yield a few wisps of heaven and earth's essence.

It was despairing to hear.

But if using a martial artist's charcoal and large cauldron, it could be done in less than a day, or even half a day. With higher-grade charcoal, it would be even faster.

As for the pots of "Crab Treasure" Li Xian boiled himself, they couldn't even be considered essence meat. Such things are looked down upon by martial artists and are useless for mud spirits.

However, Li Xian, by accident, took it very seriously.

Each time a pot of essence soup was finished, the Madam would give Li Xian a piece of essence meat the size of a finger joint.

And three-tenths of the thick essence soup.

[Congenital Cleansing Fetal Diagram]
[Mastery: 26/81]

Fetal impurities were washed away by the essence of heaven and earth. The "Hand-Washing Form" was completed, and the "Foot-Washing Form" was over halfway.

The time for consuming essence was just around the corner!

Li Xian's "mud spirit" body was increasingly revealing its true nature. His facial features hadn't changed, but his temperament was becoming more and more extraordinary.

Madam Wen, upon seeing him, would often praise him openly and started paying more attention to Li Xian. She had deep experience. Although for ordinary people, a martial artist who consumes essence is already unattainably high... in her eyes, it was quite common.

Precisely because she had seen all kinds of essence-consuming martial artists, she knew that not everyone who "cleanses their fetal" would show obvious changes.

Some people... only after washing away the fetal impurities do they realize their true form is also flawed and incomplete.

Yet Li Xian was gradually developing an ethereal, otherworldly aura. His appearance hadn't changed, but he gave off an increasingly extraordinary feeling.

Madam Wen speculated that once his fetal impurities were completely shed, his true form would definitely not be bad. It might even reveal a decent [Fetal-Shedding Appearance].

The Madam's recent essence soups seemed to be all of the "Water Element" type. Either from turtles or carp and other water demons.

"Hm?"

After consuming the essence treasure, Li Xian rubbed his eyes.

He suddenly felt a slight itch in his eyes, but the sensation disappeared quickly. He didn't pay much attention to it.

On this day.

The Madam was going to open the furnace to refine pills!

The path of martial arts is vast and profound... Cooking essence for consumption, in the end, if one has strength and wealth, one can just spend money. For mud spirits like Li Xian, who have no connections or paths, it is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Even if they look forward to it with longing, they cannot hope for a pot of essence food.

But for the Madam, with ample resources, connections, strength, and money, it was just a matter of lifting her hand and handing it to her subordinates.

But "refining pills" was different.

The Madam clearly valued it more, requiring the investment of energy and time.

Madam Wen asked: "Recently, have there been any thieves or rats lurking near my Yunxiang Building?"

"No, this place is patrolled by personnel around the clock. I've added three more patrol routes, making it stricter than before. Not even a mosquito could get in," Li Xian said with a smile, cupping his hands.

Yunxiang Building was where "herbs" were stored and housed. Located in the northeast part of the manor, some rare herbs had strict storage requirements and needed to consider geomancy.

Therefore, this Yunxiang Building was relatively far from the Madam's inner courtyard residence, but it was a key patrol point for the guards. Almost twenty-four hours a day, there were people guarding it without pause.

"Young as you are, you speak so exaggeratedly. Can you really keep even mosquitoes out?" Madam Wen sneered, then continued: "During my pill refinement, you need to be extra careful. If anyone disturbs my refinement, I'll have you beaten."

With a waft of fragrant wind, she had already entered the Yunxiang Building.

She spoke to Pang Long in a gentle tone, but for some reason, when speaking to Li Xian, she was quite rude. Sometimes, punishment and scolding were constantly on her lips.

"Yes!" Li Xian nodded.

"Come up with me too," Madam Wen's voice came back.

"Me?"

Li Xian was stunned, thinking: "Yunxiang Building is a restricted area in the manor. Commander Pang once told me that even he cannot enter it,只能 patrolling outside the building. Why is the Madam asking me to go up?"

He didn't understand, but he still followed. The Madam walked in front, and Li Xian followed a step behind, close enough to smell the Madam's faint fragrance.

The building was pitch black.

The Madam took out a fire striker and blew on it gently. A light flared up, yellow-white and exceptionally bright. But the Yunxiang Pavilion was enormous, and the light couldn't illuminate everything.

The Madam flicked her sleeve, and the fire striker went out. But the flame on it split into dozens of tiny sparks, precisely landing on each oil lamp.

The entire Yunxiang Pavilion was instantly brightly lit.

"What a formidable technique!" Li Xian saw some of the underlying principles; the depth of martial arts attainment was immeasurable, and he almost applauded. He held back, however, only cheering inwardly.

"The herbs in this building include rare treasures that I have collected here. Many of them possess strange toxins, so don't touch anything randomly," Madam Wen warned, then walked towards the second floor of the pavilion.

The storage of medicines must be based on their medicinal properties.

Some medicines cannot be separated from the earth's energy and are mostly stored on the first floor. Some medicines cannot touch the earth's energy and are thus stored on the second floor.

The Yunxiang Pavilion is entirely wooden, constructed from "Golden Silk Jade Wood." This type of wood is as smooth as jade, preserves fragrance, repels insects, and cannot be ignited. It is a common material for building medicinal repositories.

Walking inside, it felt like accidentally entering a palace of gold and jade.

Rows of medicine cabinets stored over a thousand types of herbs. Li Xian had the wisdom of two lifetimes, but seeing such a scene, the astonishment in his heart was hard to put into words.

Suddenly, a "croak" sound was heard. Li Xian looked up and saw a赤色蛙兽 (red frog beast) imprisoned in a golden cage.

This frog had a strange appearance; it actually had two wings and a blue horn on its forehead. Its croaking wasn't loud, but it made one's hair stand on end.

"This is the Bewitching Heart Frog," Madam Wen said. "I obtained it years ago when I passed by a village. This frog's croak has the power to bewitch the human heart. At the time, I passed by that village and found that all the villagers communicated using frog sounds. I knew this creature couldn't be far away, so I captured it."

"This vile beast tried to bewitch me with its sound when I came in. Pay it no mind."

Li Xian thought to himself: "There are such strange things in the world." He looked at it a couple more times.

Madam Wen asked: "Aren't you afraid?"

Li Xian said: "No."

Madam Wen nodded: "You have good courage." She stared at Li Xian for a moment, then continued forward. There were many herbs in the pavilion, so she naturally wouldn't introduce them one by one.

Walking to a certain area, she said: "Help me pick four types of herbs. The prescription is here. Match the quantities according to it."
