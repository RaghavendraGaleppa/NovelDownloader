# Chapter 413: The Sect Leader, Times Have Changed, A Way to Break the Deadlock!

“Someone outside? Watching like tigers?”

Qin Yuzhi was completely in the dark about who the three people before her were, her head filled with question marks.

She felt exactly like someone who had fallen asleep in a university lecture, only to wake up and attend another class, only to realize it wasn't even her class...

“I can see you don't understand a thing.”

Li Mo’s expression was solemn, his voice deep and heavy.

“...Was I supposed to understand?”

Before Qin Yuzhi fell into her slumber, her soul had suffered a heavy blow.

Now, she had been forcibly awakened, and upon waking, she almost ran into what seemed to be the revival of the First Immortal of the Nine Heavens, scaring her soul half out of her body.

All she knew now was her own identity, the reason for her slumber, and some scattered fragments of memory.

“My name is Li Mo. The cause of all this is as follows... During the New Year, Ying Bing had a strange dream.”

Time was tight; the group outside wouldn't hold back for long.

Li Mo was concise, first introducing himself and Ying Bing.

Then, starting from the Black Year Beast, he quickly recounted their journey to this place.

“You all broke through the Cloud Dream Palace and arrived here.”

“But because of the anomalies in the Cloud Dream Palace, many other forces were attracted. They’ve also arrived outside the Crystal Palace, just a step behind you. They’re blocking the exit right now?”

“I see...”

Listening to Li Mo’s detailed explanation, this Sect Leader from the Demon Summoning Sect or perhaps the God Summoning Sect era, roughly understood the situation.

She frowned:

“But how could the anomalies of the Cloud Dream Palace attract so many forces...”

“Ah, that’s not the point.”

Li Mo looked up at the ceiling and coughed lightly:

“The problem now is that the people outside definitely won’t let us leave easily.”

“Hahaha... Not something to worry about.”

Qin Yuzhi let out a light laugh, hands behind her back, exuding an air of confidence as if everything were under control.

She was tall, only slightly shorter than the Ice Cube. Her bangs covered one eye. Although she seemed timid and cowardly just moments ago, she now looked like a proper Sect Leader.

“By the way, who exactly is outside?”

“The Crown Prince of the current dynasty, and his protector.”

“The Crown Prince?”

Hearing this, Qin Yuzhi’s expression remained unchanged as she pulled out the Red Tile and unfolded it.

So this thing is actually a spatial artifact?

Li Mo couldn't help but complain internally. Then he watched as she took out a bronze whip from it. It had eight sides, each carved with different totems, looking dignified and solemn.

“This was bestowed by the First Emperor of the dynasty upon his ascension. It is a divine whip passed down through generations of the Sect Leader.”

“It can beat corrupt officials in the court and treacherous ministers below. Forget the Crown Prince, even the Emperor would tremble in fear upon seeing it!”

“That powerful?”

Little Li leaned back slightly, solemnly extending both hands.

This was practically the Shangfang Sword of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands!

“It is quite authoritative.”

Seeing Li Mo’s unsophisticated appearance, Qin Yuzhi handed the divine whip to him, reluctantly letting him touch it and admire it.

“Tsk, the craftsmanship, the material.”

As soon as Li Mo held it, he felt its heavy weight.

The carvings were intricate, seemingly crafted by spirits, and the material was divine, possessing the same texture as the few rare divine irons in his system space.

Moreover, it faintly carried a hint of the Hammer Treasure’s vibe?

But what puzzled Li Mo was that with such material and craftsmanship, it should be a divine weapon, so why was it completely devoid of spirituality...

He flipped it over.

Li Mo frowned:

“Made in the first year of the Tianwu era of the Great Shang... Which emperor bestowed this?”

“You fool, of course it was Emperor Tianwu!”

Qin Yuzhi rolled her eyes; this kid didn't even know that.

Li Mo: “...”

---

“Why aren't you speaking?” Qin Yuzhi asked, confused.

“You’re holding a whip from the previous dynasty to beat the Crown Prince of the current one?!”

Li Mo slapped the whip onto the ground with a *plop*.

Thinking about it, it made sense. Now, the Great Yu Dynasty holds the Emperor as supreme.

How could there be something like a Shangfang Sword held in the hands of a sect that worships gods.

It seems the Great Shang Dynasty was more like a theocracy...

“You brat, why did you throw my whip!”

Qin Yuzhi was originally furious, but then she sensed something was off.

“What do you mean by ‘previous dynasty’...”

“The Great Shang fell thousands of years ago! Now, the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands are unified, ruled by the Great Yu Dynasty, governing together with the sects.”

Sect Leader, times have changed!

The information was overwhelming.

Qin Yuzhi was struck as if by lightning, her legs trembling.

“The Great Shang is gone... How could the Great Shang be gone? That was the nation she protected... Mandate of Heaven...”

She muttered to herself, involuntarily glancing at Ying Bing.

Then, she deeply lowered her gaze, continuing to be confused.

After a long while, Qin Yuzhi recovered from her system crash:

“If it’s just the current Crown Prince and his protector, while we are within the Cloud Dream Palace, I wouldn’t necessarily be powerless to fight.”

“The other is the Crown Prince’s royal uncle, at the mid-stage of the Profound Realm,” Tian Miao spoke up.

Ying Bing gazed outside the Crystal Palace and said softly, “He wields the Way of Heavenly Tribulation.”

“Imperial Protector... The Way of Heavenly Tribulation?”

Qin Yuzhi’s expression froze. Her Way of Dreams was completely suppressed by this path.

Moreover, she was at a disadvantage in terms of cultivation level.

“By the way, what about the other group?”

“Uh... As for the other group, speaking of which, you’re actually their boss, but from a long time ago.”

Li Mo coughed lightly, a bit unsure how to phrase it.

“Oh? My sect still exists?!”

Qin Yuzhi’s eyes lit up, and she straightened her back again, laughing heartily:

“Of course, my sect has a long history, dating back to the Divine and Demon era. How could it be gone...”

“Correction, it’s the Demon Summoning Sect,” Li Mo reminded her.

Qin Yuzhi: “?”

Li Mo didn’t know what had happened in between, so he told her what he knew:

“The Demon Summoning Sect is now infamous, with crimes too numerous to list. None of its branches do anything decent, especially the Hundred Beasts Branch, which is ‘heartfelt’ even to its own people. In the Great Yu Dynasty, it’s a sect that everyone wants to destroy.”

“The Great Yu Dynasty has issued a decree: anyone found joining the Demon Summoning Sect will be executed immediately, no need to wait for autumn.”

“The Demon Summoning Sect turned out this way, I’m afraid it’s because the leadership is corrupt. If you reveal your identity, neither the Demon Summoning Sect nor the Great Yu Dynasty will tolerate you.”

“Huh?”

Qin Yuzhi sat down on the ground, her eyes vacant, as if her soul had left her body.

Li Mo, feeling a bit sorry for her, said: “Although the Demon Summoning Sect is a demonic sect, it hasn’t done *no* good deeds.”

“Like what?”

“Promoting the advancement of many laws in the Great Yu Dynasty, such as the Anti-Fraud Law, the Anti-Smuggling Law, the Human Organ Trading Law...”

“...”

Sect Leader Qin’s bent back finally snapped.

Seeing her hugging her knees on the ground, a dark cloud seemingly raining over her head, she probably wished she could go back to lying in her coffin.

It seems we can’t count on her.

Rumble—

Outside, thunder rolled, blinding light flashed, and even the Crystal Palace vibrated from the shock.

The destructive aura seemed to pierce through the palace walls, making one’s hair stand on end and feel uneasy.

But it was precisely when this lightning flashed that...

The genius Li Mo had a stroke of inspiration!

“I have a plan!”
