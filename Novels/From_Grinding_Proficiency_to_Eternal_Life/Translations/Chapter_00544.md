# Chapter 544: Is Dual Cultivation Really Such an Inconvenient Method?

Xu Yunfan naturally went along with the situation. The death of a Qi Condensation disciple from the Primordial Origin Sect was insignificant.

However, the death of a Foundation Establishment disciple was somewhat troublesome. It wasn't that he couldn't kill them, but rather that the aftermath would have certain flaws. Once he went to the Scripture Pavilion to learn a secret technique for clearing away causal traces, he wouldn't need to worry too much. If he could refine the Heavenly Mechanism Treasure, the Star-Hiding Ring of Chaos, into his being, it would be even better to become someone who could kill without accumulating karma.

Even if a Golden Core True Lord came to investigate, they wouldn't be able to find anything.

After all, a Foundation Establishment True Lord was considered a pillar of strength even within the Three Sects.

Golden Core True Lords were high and mighty, and the Foundation Establishment True Lords beneath them were the ones who handled affairs. If the workers were gone, how could others not become anxious?

At this moment, Liu Yunhua's heart was filled with bitterness. This was completely different from what she had imagined.

Xu Yunfan had no intention of showing mercy.

She was a bewitching figure from the Hundred Desires Peak, yet she hadn't expected to fall into Xu Yunfan's hands here.

Who isn't afraid of death? Cultivators are even more so. Some charge forward bravely, all for the sake of breaking through their shackles and stepping into a new world.

Now that the situation was against her, she couldn't even fight back. As a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect, Liu Yunhua certainly wouldn't act like a tough nut to crack.

His voice paused as he added, "Don't even think about using fakes to fool me. This true art has its own Dao rhythm and laws; I can perceive them. If there is a single mistake..."

With just a slight attempt, the attribute panel would naturally tell him if it was real or fake.

His gaze swept over Liu Yunhua's desperate and fearful eyes, then glanced at the trembling Pu Yu beside her. He said indifferently, "Coincidentally, I obtained a Heavenly Mechanism Treasure. The two of you coming to find me, I'm afraid no one else knows about it. If the art is fake, then you will just become two puddles of thunder ash at the bottom of Thunder Valley below Divine Thunder Peak, unable to reincarnate for all eternity."

Liu Yunhua's body trembled violently, and the last glimmer of hope in her eyes was completely extinguished.

She had misjudged him.

She had thought he was just a small fish that had come out of the Divine Martial World, but she never expected him to be a man-eating shark.

The person before her, the Peak Master of Divine Thunder Peak, was far more ruthless in his methods, meticulous in his thinking, and superior in his strength than she had initially estimated.

Her "Inner Scenery Unbroken" could resist the *Hundred Desires Devouring Origin Great Method*, but it absolutely could not withstand this strike infused with the Divine Thunder Tribulation Lightning凝聚 by Xu Yunfan!

The *Divine Thunder Nine Courts Celestial Dome Indestructible True Sutra*.

Back in the day, it was this art that allowed the Divine Thunder Nine Courts True Lord to rank among the top of the mid Golden Core stage.

Cheng Chengnan's intelligence error had turned her from a hunter into a prisoner, and now she had even been completely stripped of the capital to struggle.

It was simply beastly; that Cheng Chengnan had deliberately misled her.

She did not doubt Xu Yunfan's determination and ability in the slightest.

With her life hanging by a thread, all her calculations had become bubbles.

What pride, what master of a peak, what dignity of a Foundation Establishment True Lord? Before life and death, before the threat of having one's soul scattered and being unable to reincarnate for all eternity, they were all as insignificant as dust.

Her body slumped, like a skin that had lost its last support. The tense, resistant posture completely relaxed, her shoulders drooped, and her head hung deep, almost burying itself in her chest.

The sharp, cold sneer and the forced hint of restraint on her face vanished, leaving only endless exhaustion, fear, and a desperate resignation to her fate.

Xu Yunfan looked on, filled with cold indifference.

Women were the best at acting, especially beautiful women, and especially women from the Primordial Origin Sect who cultivated seductive dual cultivation techniques.

"It's... it's Junior Brother... Senior Sister was foolish... Junior Brother, spare me!"

Her voice was choked with sobs, a panic and urgency born of accepting her fate after sliding to her knees.

"I'll give it! I'll give it! I won't hide anything! Please, Junior Brother, for the sake of our bond as fellow disciples... no, for the sake of my sensible attitude, please be magnanimous!"

To save her life, she even used the ridiculous excuse of "bond as fellow disciples."

The most stubborn bones in the demonic path were those of newborn calves, while those who could truly cultivate to mid Foundation Establishment, or even experience reincarnation, were mostly "old devils" who were well-versed in the principle of "it is better to live on than to die."

Face?

Integrity?

Those are things to be discussed only after one has survived.

Once their vital point was pressed, they would immediately become soft and compliant, showing their most obedient posture, retracting their cold fangs, and waiting for a chance to counterattack.

Disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect were masters of this.

Xu Yunfan was not surprised by this at all.

This was a trait etched into the bones of demonic sect cultivators.

When faced with absolute, irresistible power, they surrendered faster than anyone else, with a posture more humble and obedient than anyone else.

But beneath this humble and obedient facade lay a chilling venom and poisonous fangs waiting for a chance to bite back.

If there was no chance of survival in a desperate situation, then the instinct to survive would turn a demonic sect disciple into a battle-crazed maniac who disregards life and death.

"Begin."

Xu Yunfan retracted the lightning at his fingertip, sat down cross-legged, and pointed from a distance. A gentle strand of spiritual sense pierced Liu Yunhua's brow, establishing a one-way information channel that he absolutely controlled.

Liu Yunhua dared not be negligent. Enduring the intense pain in her soul and the weakness of her body, she concentrated all her mind to recall,凝聚, and engrave.

This was her only chance.

Traces of incantations containing profound meanings, like a trickling stream, flowed into Xu Yunfan's sea of consciousness through the spiritual sense channel.

She didn't dare to be the slightest bit negligent, nor did she dare to have any falsehood, because the aura of the Divine Thunder Tribulation Lightning seemed to be perpetually hanging over her head, ready to fall at any moment.

She even proactively added her unique understanding of the Yin-Yang law from her two lifetimes of cultivation, the experience of impacting the threshold of mid Foundation Establishment and constructing the "Yin-Yang Inner Scenery," the key points of obscurity that might be encountered during the art's operation, and the backlash and heart demon pitfalls to be wary of when the art's overbearing plunder of essence and energy occurred, all as clearly and in detail as possible.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but slightly raise his eyebrows, looking at Liu Yunhua in surprise.

He truly hadn't expected her to go this far.

But thinking about it, he understood. A person could only have all opportunities if they were alive. Once dead, it was all over.

This woman was a character.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a trace of apprehension. If she were to be released, he wouldn't be able to eat or sleep in peace.

Time passed in the dead silent and oppressive cave dwelling.

There was only the faint fluctuation of information flowing through spiritual sense, and Pu Yu's suppressed breathing.

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes and concentrated. His sea of consciousness was like a boundless starry sea, carefully "reading" every rune and every incantation that flowed in.

As the information poured in, the profound scroll of the Foundation Establishment chapter of the *True Sutra of Yin-Yang Union and Opposition in the Intersection of Heaven and Earth* slowly unfolded in his mind. It was cross-referenced with the *Hundred Desires Devouring Origin Great Method* he already knew and the *Divine Thunder Nine Courts True Sutra* he primarily cultivated.

The more he cross-referenced, the clearer his understanding became, and a sense of admiration arose in his heart.

This true sutra truly lived up to its reputation.

It was different from the *Hundred Desires Devouring Origin Great Method*, which focused on the union of men and women and the overbearing, one-way plunder of dual cultivation.

The *True Sutra of Yin-Yang Union and Opposition in the Intersection of Heaven and Earth* had a higher standing, and the objects of its dual cultivation were not limited to humans.

It felt a bit like it was transcending humanity.
