# Chapter 92: Duelling with a True Person!

As the [Yama Hall] hung high in the sky, an eerie wind swept through the 800-li Skull Mountain, filled with continuous wails, as if it had transformed into a human purgatory. The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord, standing amidst it, had an extremely grim expression.

"You think you can kill me with just these methods?" He was almost laughing from anger. Regardless of whether Lu Yang was a reincarnated True Person of the Saint Sect, trying to kill him like this was far too disrespectful!

On the other side, Lu Yang's expression was calm. The Dharma Protector Maiden, Su Nü, who had transformed within his dantian, was now sweating profusely, unreservedly bestowing her divine status upon him, making him appear even more solemn and sacred, as if he had become the center of the 800-li Skull Mountain realm.

"Let's give it a try. I was just about to witness senior's divine abilities."

The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord heard this and took a deep look at Lu Yang, then nodded: "Alright, let me see which colleague you truly were in the past!" Clearly, he had already affirmed Lu Yang's identity. He must be a reincarnated True Person of the Saint Sect! As for why he didn't state it explicitly, it was actually quite normal. Every True Person of the Saint Sect, without exception, carried some troublesome karma. Such as enemies, enemies, and more enemies. Now that they had finally reincarnated, it was a good time to shake off past life karma. Who would willingly acknowledge their former identity and accept the karma of their past life?

As his voice fell, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord bent down, scooped up a handful of yellow earth, and infused it with magical power for a moment before scattering it. The earth and dust rooted upon landing, instantly forming a large clump of soil. The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's soul entered it, and in an instant, the clump transformed into his likeness.

"Though it's a body of earth and stone, it's just about enough," the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord murmured softly, grains of sand continuously falling from his opening and closing lips. Regardless, his soul finally had a temporary dwelling.

*Boom!*

As the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord cast his spell, Lu Yang didn't just stand by. Within the [Yama Hall], cries of slaughter rolled out as witch-ghosts emerged behind Lu Yang. These witch-ghosts, all armed with blades and clad in armor, revealed hideous green faces and fangs. They were neatly arrayed, comprising Yin soldiers and ghost generals, their movements orderly. With a thought from Lu Yang, they immediately charged towards the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord.

"Mere specters and demons dare approach my Dharma body?" The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord scoffed at this sight. Immediately, a spiritual light rose from the top of his head, dividing Yin and Yang and displaying black and white energies. Upon closer inspection, it was a scroll painting. He cultivated the Heaven-Mending True Scripture, and the Dao Foundation he ultimately established was called the "Yin-Yang Grand Dao Chart." The chart had two sides: one Jueyin, and one Mingyang. It used Yin and Yang to expound on the myriad phenomena of the cosmos. Whatever divine ability or wondrous technique one displayed, once it entered the chart, it would be decomposed, refined, and even used for his own purposes.

At this moment, the scroll unfurled, revealing the "Jueyin" side facing upwards. The [Yama Hall] was inherently dominated by malevolent Yin, and all forms of witch-ghosts were also Yin-attributed. They were perfectly countered by "Jueyin," making any number of them futile.

The next second, the chart flipped. Jueyin turned to Mingyang, and a vast heavenly light instantly illuminated the four directions of the Yama Hall. Wherever it passed, all Yin soldiers and ghost generals were ignited, turning to dust in an instant. However, at the same time, several streaks of dark light, like bolts of lightning, struck into the Yin-Yang Chart, causing the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord to grunt. Cracks also suddenly appeared on his earth-and-stone body.

Nine Heavens Grand Register Secret Demonic Yin Thunder! Patriarch Tingyou had once used this divine ability to restrain Lu Yang's soul. Now, Lu Yang was employing the same trick to deal with the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's soul!

"As expected, you do have some skill." The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's expression was grim. In the recent clash, although Lu Yang was undoubtedly more severely injured than him, he himself inevitably sustained some minor injuries.

The confrontations between Foundation Establishment cultivators were vastly different from those of Qi Refinement. True Person duels were about manifesting phenomena through qi, using one's own magical power to display their respective Dao Foundations. As the Dao Foundations operated, countless divine abilities were generated every moment. Therefore, when both sides manifested their Dao Foundations and clashed, it was equivalent to each deploying a large army, with every soldier being a divine ability. Each collision was a confrontation between two armies. Whoever was routed, losing armor and troops, until unable to manifest their Dao Foundation, would be considered defeated.

This type of duel severely tested calculation abilities, in other words, their respective Dao cultivation. Simply put, it was like arranging troops: where to mass heavy forces, where to feign strength, where to send a lone deep thrust, where to lay an ambush on all sides. High Dao cultivation allowed one to anticipate the enemy, calmly make arrangements, and freely adapt to changes. Low Dao cultivation would result in being manipulated at will. Therefore, duels between Foundation Establishment True Persons, unless the disparity was too great, were difficult to decide quickly, and even if one won, it was hard to kill the opponent.

Lu Yang's Dao cultivation was undoubtedly incomparable to that of the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord. But his condition was better. The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's physical body was now destroyed, leaving only his soul, and his Dao Foundation was unstable. Lu Yang's [Yama Hall], however, had just been established and was at its peak. This was like Lu Yang commanding an army of one hundred thousand, while the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord had only ten thousand elite troops. The quantitative disparity between them was so vast that Lu Yang didn't need any complex battle formations; he could simply employ a trade-off tactic, exchanging injuries, and over time, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord would naturally be defeated.

*Rumble!*

Lu Yang gave the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord no respite. Within the Yama Hall, Yin soldiers and ghost generals resurrected, once again swarming towards the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord. For a moment, thunderous roars echoed above Skull Mountain. The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's face grew increasingly grim. The cracks on his temporary earth-and-stone body became clearer, as if it would completely crumble the next second.

"You want us both to suffer greatly?" The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord looked at Lu Yang, a mix of surprise and doubt in his heart. Compared to him, Lu Yang's condition seemed far too good, showing no signs of injury. And indeed, that was the case.

*'Anyway, I'm not the one getting hurt,'* Lu Yang glanced at his dantian, only to see that the Dharma Protector Maiden, Su Nü, was now covered in wounds, her entire body cracked, her condition significantly worse than the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's. *'...It's not a big problem.'* Lu Yang remained calm and composed, continuing to frantically squeeze Su Nü's power. After all, she wasn't dead yet; as long as she wasn't dead, she could be used to the fullest. After all, dueling was too dangerous; it was better to let someone else bear the burden.

Finally, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord couldn't hold on any longer. He had thought that a young True Person like Lu Yang would cherish his life more and preserve his Dao Foundation. Who would have thought Lu Yang was so fierce, practically seeking mutual destruction!

"I can't drag this out any longer!" With this thought, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's mind shifted. The Yin-Yang Grand Dao Chart immediately closed, Jueyin and Mingyang converging, finally giving birth to a point of chaotic splendor. This point of splendor initially glowed faintly like a spark, but as the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's magical power was injected, it instantly ignited into a prairie fire, emitting boundless light. Wherever it passed, whether Yin soldiers, ghost generals, or Secret Demonic Yin Thunder, all turned to naught. It pierced through the sky, even penetrating the Yama Hall!

*Rumble!*

For a moment, chaotic colors flowed inside and outside the dome of the sky, black and white merged without distinction. In their flickering, they instantly cleared the churning malevolent Yin. Seeing this, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord dared not delay and immediately soared into the air. What he had just unleashed was a great divine ability called the "Yin-Yang Chaotic Primordial Profound Divine Light." In the past, he had relied on this great divine ability to break through to Foundation Establishment. After Foundation Establishment, with the blessings of the Foundation Establishment status, his former great divine ability could manifest many profound changes distinct from Qi Refinement. For instance, the "Yin-Yang Chaotic Primordial Profound Divine Light" that he now wielded, which in Qi Refinement could only absorb myriad phenomena, could now instantly eradicate spiritual essence, possessing the power to cleanse defilement and purify filth.

However, there were always gains and losses; such a divine ability naturally consumed immense energy. If he were still at his peak, it wouldn't matter, but in his current state, once would be fine, but three times or more would likely exhaust him. Therefore, using it now was purely to break the stalemate. As long as he escaped the [Yama Hall], he would be like a bird flying high in the sky or a fish leaping in the vast sea. At that point, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord would have room to advance or retreat, gaining flexibility.

However, just as he flew out of the Yama Hall, his expression instantly changed drastically. Outside the [Yama Hall], Lu Yang's figure quietly appeared. This time, however, the Dharma Protector Maiden, Su Nü, did not accompany him; she remained in place.

"Two people!?" The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's pupils contracted sharply as he instantly understood: "An External Incarnation! You aren't Foundation Establishment yourself; you merely managed to refine a Foundation Establishment realm incarnation!"

Lu Yang ignored him, silently extending a finger. Generally, he could only duel the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord when merged with Su Nü. However, if it was limited to a single move, he wasn't without a trump card. This move was taught to him by Patriarch Tingyou.

The next second, Lu Yang began to break through to Foundation Establishment, ascend, and then plummet! Lu Yang's expression was serene, his qi dynamics shifting. He then wrapped himself in the majestic power of a failed ascension, plummeting from the Foundation Establishment realm, and pointed a finger at the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord—

"Heaven's Collapse!"

Shadows fell from the sky. Lu Yang's single finger caught the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord completely off guard, intercepting his fleeing movement in mid-air! Immediately after, the [Yama Hall] opened its gates once more.

*Boom!*

With a deafening roar, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord's eyes were bloodshot, yet he was helpless. He was struck down by Lu Yang's single finger and fell back into the [Yama Hall]!
