# Chapter 70: Thunder Sword Talisman

After the time it takes an incense stick to burn...

The formation portal of Cave Abode No. 68 had already sealed shut. The Minor Earth Formation emitted a thick, earthy-yellow light screen, resembling an enormous inverted bowl tightly covering the area. It was a pity that Old Man Zhang, who had purchased it just days ago, would never get to enjoy it.

In the courtyard...

Wang Chan sat cross-legged within the three-layered defense of his Earth Prison Talismans, meditating with his eyes closed. Yet a strand of his divine sense remained vigilant, monitoring the surroundings.

Suddenly, the mid-grade Qi Recovery Talisman on his body turned to ash and scattered to the ground.

His dantian's mana had recovered by seventy to eighty percent.

Though he had immediately activated the restriction token to seal the area after the Golden Snake Woman fled, the earlier battle had drained him severely. With the Golden Snake Woman still at large, one could never be too careful.

Thus, he remained in place, using the Earth Prison Talismans' protection to recover his mana. Currently, within Lotus Mountain, nothing felt more secure than the three-layered mid-grade Earth Prison Talisman's barrier.

Unfortunately, he had already used up half of his twenty-some Earth Prison Talismans. He wasn't sure if he'd have another chance to encounter the flower-skirted female cultivator at the black market again.

Feeling the surging mana coursing through his body—enough to handle any crisis—Wang Chan slowly opened his eyes.

With a sweep of his sleeve, the three white needles that had fallen outside the barrier transformed into black needles, then into gaseous needles before vanishing from sight.

Then, gazing at the corpses of Old Man Zhang and Luo Bing, he sighed silently and tossed out a low-grade Fireball Talisman.

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

They deserved a proper burial.

With a hiss, flames erupted within the Earth Prison Talisman's barrier. Thick smoke billowed, trapped by the barrier, making the heat unbearable.

Wang Chan, however, remained unfazed. Protected by his mana shield and a Body Protection Talisman, he simply conjured a mana barrier to block the heat and smoke, watching calmly as the two corpses were consumed by the flames.

Considering how Old Man Zhang and Luo Bing had loved swinging under the grapevine trellis in the courtyard, eating grapes, he decided to bury their ashes beneath the swing. They'd surely be happy, enjoying themselves even in the afterlife.

As he pondered this, his gaze swept the surroundings—nothing seemed amiss.

Yet, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the bloodstained white robe nearby was changing. The text and patterns on it were gradually fading.

Without hesitation, he focused his divine sense on the robe, carefully scanning it.

After the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea, Wang Chan had memorized all the information on the robe.

By now, the text had faded almost beyond recognition.

Examining the robe, though it was just an ordinary spiritual garment, it clearly had some age to it, and its material was exceptional.

A few breaths later, the information on the robe vanished completely, along with the bloodstains.

Wang Chan mimicked Old Man Zhang, spitting a mouthful of essence blood onto the robe.

But no text appeared.

It seemed only Old Man Zhang's essence blood could activate it.

Not that it mattered—he had already committed everything to memory. At the same time, virtual text appeared before his eyes:

**[Discovered low-grade Talisman Crafting Technique: Zhang Jiuyue's Talisman Crafting. Record?]**

Learning from past mistakes, Wang Chan didn't rush to record it. What if he could obtain a mid-grade talisman crafting technique later?

Currently, the "Skills" category only had three recording slots—he couldn't afford to waste them. (Note: Changing "Skill" to "Crafting" might be more fitting.)

Still, even a low-grade talisman crafting technique was incredibly valuable.

Professions like spiritual farmer, physician, or demon hunter were common—relying on corresponding spells, divine abilities, magical tools, and experience.

But talisman crafting, artifact forging, alchemy, formation crafting, puppetry, and beast taming—these high-level crafts required specialized techniques to even begin.

These inheritances, even at the low-grade level, were in some ways comparable to mid-grade cultivation methods or spells—if not superior.

The reason was simple: mastering these crafts was like owning a golden goose, providing a steady stream of cultivation resources.

Especially since this low-grade talisman crafting technique had no restrictions—meaning he could pass it on to others, trade it, or even sell it if needed.

For example, when Qu Lian had imparted the **[Thunder Seal Curse]** and **[Water-Fire Escape Technique]**, she had used a legendary inheritance jade slip, directly transmitting the knowledge without requiring him to scan it with his divine sense.

But afterward, he had to sign a confidentiality contract, swearing not to divulge the techniques.

And the level of that contract was terrifying—fourth-tier!

It was as if a Yang God True Monarch was watching him at all times.

This made Wang Chan deeply wary of Qu Lian.

At the same time, it also filled him with anticipation—if Qu Lian got entangled with corpse-devouring insects a few more times, he might have a chance to obtain high-grade spells.

By now, the flames had burned out, leaving only ashes. Wang Chan took out a jade box, carefully storing the remains and the white robe inside before sealing it with a talisman.

Once he tidied up here, he'd handle their funeral arrangements.

His gaze then fell on the corpse of the Golden Snake Woman.

She was a wanted criminal. Even as a corpse, turning her in would fetch a decent sum. But Wang Chan didn't want to draw attention or deal with the hassle.

Just as he was about to leave the Earth Prison Talisman's barrier to dispose of the body and cleanse the area with a mid-grade Purification Talisman, the Minor Earth Formation's barrier suddenly trembled violently.

Looking up, he saw a massive thunderous sword phantom descending from the sky, slashing into the thick barrier.

After a brief stalemate of three to four breaths, the barrier shattered into motes of light, dispersing into the air.

At the same time, the thunder sword phantom also dissipated.

Wang Chan immediately halted, readying the Golden Armor Talisman and other mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans hidden in his sleeve.

The Minor Earth Formation was a fully powered low-grade formation, drawing on the earth's energy. Even a mid-grade spell would take half a cup of tea's time to break through—it shouldn't have shattered in one strike.

Even if Wang Chan attacked with his thunder needles, he'd need at least three consecutive strikes on the same spot to breach it.

Yet that thunder sword phantom had shattered the barrier in one blow—its power was beyond expectations.

A thought flashed through Wang Chan's mind—**Thunder Sword Talisman!**

If the Golden Armor Talisman was one of the five great defensive talismans, then the Thunder Sword Talisman's reputation among offensive talismans was equally formidable.

Who would've thought the Golden Snake Woman had such a powerful mid-grade talisman as a trump card?

Before he could ponder further, another thunder sword phantom descended. From a dozen zhang away, the disheveled, bloodied Golden Snake Woman, her defenses gone, screamed hysterically, "Before I die, I'll drag you down with me to avenge my sister!"

In an instant, the Thunder Sword Talisman's power struck the Earth Prison Talisman's barrier.

*Crack!*

*Crack!*

Two layers of defense were pierced in succession.

Seeing the Golden Snake Woman, though keeping her distance, had no defenses, Wang Chan prepared to covertly control his gaseous needles. But the sudden movement startled him.

Without hesitation, he slapped a Golden Armor Talisman onto himself and activated two more Earth Prison Talismans for defense.

At that moment, a third thunder sword phantom struck.

And from afar, the Golden Snake Woman flipped her hands, producing two more mid-grade Thunder Sword Talismans, ready to activate them.

"Where did she get so many Thunder Sword Talismans?!"

Wang Chan, aghast at such waste, couldn't let her activate them. Just as he moved to strike, another figure rushed in from the bamboo forest at the mountain path's bend, surrounded by swirling wind and bamboo leaves.

*Her?!*

Wang Chan's heart skipped a beat. With a snap of his fingers, three white needles materialized before the Golden Snake Woman's face, startling her so much she forgot to activate the talismans, instinctively dodging.

But the needles were too fast. With a *whoosh*, they pierced her undefended forehead.

Before her body could hit the ground, the three needles circled back, carrying her storage pouch and the two unused Thunder Sword Talismans toward Wang Chan.

Meanwhile, the thunder sword phantom overhead crashed down, shattering two more Earth Prison Talisman barriers.

But with the Golden Armor Talisman still active, Wang Chan ignored the residual force of the attack. With a sweep of his sleeve, he stashed the storage pouch, talismans, and needles away.

Then, he turned, composed, to face the figure standing a zhang away.

By the grapevine trellis and swing stood the beauty mark woman in white soft armor, also clad in a mid-grade Golden Armor Talisman, her hand resting on her storage pouch as she stared expressionlessly at Wang Chan.

"Fellow Daoist Wang, your needles are quite formidable. Might this humble one experience them firsthand?"
