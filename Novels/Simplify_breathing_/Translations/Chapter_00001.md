# Chapter One: Getting Stronger Just by Breathing

Pingyin County.

"Train the muscles and bones outwardly, cultivate the vital energy inwardly. At our Jishan Martial Arts Academy, everyone is treated equally. Even precious internal cultivation methods are taught to you. So long as you work hard enough, even better and stronger cultivation techniques await you!"

Bi Hong, the senior disciple of Jishan Martial Arts Academy, shouted loudly. The martial artists at the academy listened attentively. In a corner, a dark-skinned, scrawny figure also held his head high, but a closer look at his eyes revealed a dull, vacant gaze.

With a blink of his eyes, Chen Fei had inexplicably arrived in this world a little over ten days ago. By absorbing the memories of his original body, he learned that this was a world similar to ancient Earth. However, this world was home to martial artists capable of great feats, who could kill a common person as easily as crushing a chick.

Chen Fei was currently a chore boy at a medical clinic, not even considered an apprentice. He spent his days doing odd jobs. Learning medicine? That was completely out of the question; he wouldn't be given the chance. Secretly learning? If caught, he'd be crippled on the spot and left to fend for himself.

The original body was unwilling to live like this his entire life. He had been obedient and diligent at the clinic, hoping to gain favor and learn some skills. Unfortunately, all the chore boys had the same idea, creating such fierce competition that the original body questioned his very existence. In desperation, the original body had used some accumulated silver to apprentice at the Jishan Martial Arts Academy, hoping to change his fate.

Just a moment ago, a phantom panel had appeared before Chen Fei's eyes.

[Name: Chen Fei]
[Occupation: None]
[Cultivation Techniques: Jishan Fist, Jishan Breathing Technique]
[Realm: None]

"Cultivation technique discovered. Spend one tael of silver to simplify Jishan Fist?"
"Cultivation technique discovered. Spend one tael of silver to simplify Jishan Breathing Technique?"

The panel displayed some of Chen Fei's information, and two prompts continuously flickered at the bottom. Chen Fei's earlier distraction was due to staring at this suddenly appearing panel.

"What are you dazing about? Start practicing your fist forms!" Bi Hong had appeared before Chen Fei at some point, roaring, "If your Jishan Fist doesn't reach initial mastery soon, you'll have to pay again next month to enter the academy! You should know this!"

Chen Fei snapped back to reality, not daring to say more, and intensified his practice.

Recently, the area outside the county town had not been peaceful. The medical clinic frequently ran out of herbs, so going to the mountains to gather medicine every few months would likely become the norm. Chen Fei walked out of his room, intending to borrow money from other chore boys, but one tael of silver was too much for them; no one would lend it to him. If he borrowed from several people separately, it would likely arouse suspicion. Chen Fei hesitated for a moment, then left the clinic.

Half an hour later, Chen Fei retrieved the herb without losing it. Wearing a bamboo hat to obscure his face, he secretly sold the herb at a market for one tael of silver and fifty copper coins. Chen Fei dared not return to the clinic and instead slipped into an abandoned courtyard within the county.

"Simplify Jishan Breathing Technique."

Chen Fei silently recited in his mind. The next moment, the one tael of silver in his sleeve vanished, and the panel in his vision flickered slightly.

"Simplifying Jishan Breathing Technique... Simplification successful... Jishan Breathing Technique → Breathing!"

Breathing?

Before Chen Fei could fully process it, he suddenly saw that the information representing himself on the panel had changed.

[Name: Chen Fei]
[Occupation: Martial Artist]
[Cultivation Techniques: Jishan Fist, Jishan Breathing Technique (Initial Mastery 1/100)]

In a short while, these chore boys had thrown all the silver from Chen Fei's person onto the ground. There were only fifty copper coins.

"Didn't you say he sold it for one tael of silver?" Cui Sanjie frowned, turning to look at Sha Daxin.

"He must have hidden it in the courtyard." Sha Daxin was slightly flustered, but immediately thought of a reason. He strode over to Chen Fei, grabbed his collar, and roared, "Chen Fei, your secret is out! Hand over the money now, or things won't be so simple!"

"I didn't sell any herbs. Don't wrongly accuse me," Chen Fei said innocently, prying Sha Daxin's hand off.

"Steward Cui, the money must be in this courtyard. If we search properly, we'll definitely find it," Sha Daxin glared fiercely at Chen Fei before turning to Cui Sanjie.

Cui Sanjie remained silent, instead casting a glance around the dilapidated courtyard. The ground was covered in dust, the only footprints being their own; there were no other unusual signs.

"What are you doing here?" Cui Sanjie asked Chen Fei.

"My martial arts aren't progressing, so I came here to clear my head," Chen Fei murmured.

Cui Sanjie grinned. He had heard that this chore boy had apprenticed at the Jishan Martial Arts Academy, but after more than three months, he had achieved nothing.

"Sha Daxin, come here," Cui Sanjie said.

[Name: Chen Fei]
[Occupation: Martial Artist]
[Cultivation Techniques: Jishan Fist, Jishan Breathing Technique (Proficient 930/1000)]
[Realm: Martial Artist (1/100)]

The Jishan Breathing Technique had already reached the proficient stage. The sensation each breath gave his body became more pronounced. At the same time, his realm had also changed, becoming a Martial Artist.

Chen Fei had heard the senior disciple of the martial academy say that a Martial Artist was merely a common person who had just begun practicing martial arts. True achievement would be reaching the Skin-Refining Realm. Upon reaching that realm, one would truly widen the gap between themselves and ordinary people. At the same time, the Jishan Martial Arts Academy would fully accept him, making him a true member.

Just as Chen Fei was quietly studying, the panel changed again.

[Cultivation Techniques: Jishan Breathing Technique (Perfection 1/10000)]
[Realm: Martial Artist (2/100)]

The warmth within his body seemed to become even more noticeable, and his realm also increased by one point. Simultaneously, Chen Fei's stomach began to rumble. As his body gradually grew stronger, it naturally started to consume more energy.

The Grand Perfection level breathing technique gave Chen Fei an increasingly clear sensation, and the display on the panel confirmed his guess. What might have originally taken twenty days to reach the Skin-Refining Realm would now likely be achieved in just ten days, effectively halving the time.

Chen Fei's appetite gradually increased, but he wasn't scolded for it. In fact, he had even received praise by name from one of the stewards two days prior. Compared to the other listless chore boys, Chen Fei's recent mindset was noticeably more positive and energetic. This difference in his spirit and energy greatly pleased the steward, who, in a roundabout way, had begun to pay attention to Chen Fei. The other chore boys felt envious but grew closer to Chen Fei. Only Sha Daxin, lurking in a corner, watched Chen Fei with a sinister gaze.
