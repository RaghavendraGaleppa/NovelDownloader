# Chapter 704: Whales Always Appear When Fishing

Since Xiang Yunfan had brazenly killed Chiyang Zhenjun in the battle at the Boundary Sea, suppressed his Dao Fruit, and revealed the supreme imagery of the Divine Thunder's Thunder shattering all laws and the Profound Firmament's Immortality carrying the myriad heavens, he had long regarded that Dao Fruit as one containing supreme opportunities.

The power of destruction and generation within the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit held a fatal attraction to the very path he cultivated.

He had waited bitterly for many years, enduring and lying low, even going so far as to use the hidden lines he had planted within the Primordial Sect to keep a constant watch on the movements of the Divine Thunder Mountain, all for this very moment.

Back when that Dao Fruit was in the hands of Lu Chunyang, he had no thoughts of seizing it and was even prepared to reincarnate. Even if he couldn't ascend to the Golden Core stage again, with his immortal golden nature to protect him, he could continuously reincarnate and awaken his past life's wisdom. Perhaps one day, he could still re-attain the Dao Fruit.

But the situation had become so comical; unexpectedly, Xiang Yunfan had appeared in the middle of it all.

"All these years of bitter waiting were not in vain! The Grand Yin Dark Qiu Dao Fruit, and the soul origin of that Divine Thunder Zhenjun, they are all mine!"

The unnatural smile on the white-haired Zhenjun's face widened further, filled with an incredibly chilling greed.

He abruptly rose to his feet, his purple-gold Daoist robes rustling without wind. What was truly horrifying was that, unlike Tongxuan Zhenjun who had separated his soul, he instead rapidly formed a series of profound and complex hand seals with his hands.

Flowing from his fingertips was no longer the brilliance of spiritual power, but a thick, ashen death qi and a drop of emerald-green vitality.

Two completely opposing forces intertwined around him, ultimately forming the phantom of a continuously reversing wheel of life and death that enveloped his entire body.

"Life and Death Reversal, Spirit and Flesh Borrowed Passage!"

A low incantation sounded, and the reversing wheel of life and death suddenly flared with brilliant light.

The ashen death qi and the emerald vitality, like two entangled giant pythons, instantly wrapped around the white-haired Zhenjun's physical body.

A strange scene occurred.

Under the influence of this power that reversed life and death, the aura of his flesh-and-blood body rapidly became ethereal and elusive, as if it existed between life and death, reality and illusion, exuding a strange fluctuation extremely compatible with the aura of the Samsara Sea of Suffering.

The next moment, the reversing wheel, carrying his body, violently collapsed inward, transforming into a strange light that existed between life and death. It silently tore through the spatial barrier and also flew toward the direction of the Samsara Sea of Suffering.

This was actually a forbidden secret art that allowed one to forcibly cross the Samsara Sea of Suffering with a physical body.

***

The Primordial Sect, one of the Nine Immortal Mountains, Mount Chenghua.

At the mountain's peak stood a grand and ancient immortal palace.

The ruler of the Primordial Sect, the mid-Core Formation Pudu Zhenjun, sat at the center of a slowly rotating Eight Trigrams Dao Platform.

Within it, the Eight Trigrams runes flickered, deducing the qi mechanisms of heaven and earth and the karma of the myriad worlds.

The fluctuation of Xiang Yunfan's soul separating its body and forcibly breaking into the Samsara Sea of Suffering was naturally and clearly reflected in the Dao Platform's deductions, transforming into a dazzling trail of purple-gold lightning that plunged into a deep, obscure hexagram area.

Pudu Zhenjun's ancient and unsophisticated face was devoid of any expression, his eyes as deep as an eternal cold pool.

He quietly watched that trajectory disappear into the hexagram of the Sea of Suffering, his fingertips unconsciously brushing over a shattered and then re-condensed Eight Trigrams rune. In the end, he only gave an almost imperceptible, slight shake of his head.

He looked up in the direction of the white-haired Zhenjun and let out a low sigh of ambiguous meaning, tinged with a hint of disappointment.

"A young man's composure is终究 still a bit lacking."

In Pudu Zhenjun's eyes, Xiang Yunfan, having achieved the Golden Core with a single lifetime, was truly a brilliant and outstanding talent with limitless potential.

The Primordial Sect was currently in a period where new blood was dwindling and old figures were self-trapped. Xiang Yunfan's appearance was originally a sign of being favored by fortune.

As long as Xiang Yunfan could remain patient and steadily build his foundation, relying on the potential of the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit, his future achievements would be immeasurable. He could even lie low for several hundred years and might obtain another Grand Yin attribute Dao Fruit, having a hope of impacting the mid-Core Formation stage and becoming a new pillar of the Primordial Sect.

Unfortunately, he was too eager to obtain the Grand Yin Dao Fruit and actually took such a perilous step of separating his soul to forcibly break into the Sea of Suffering. This was truly unwise.

The Samsara Sea of Suffering is unpredictable and dangerous; how many brilliant and outstanding figures have been buried within it?

Furthermore, there is Tongxuan of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, and that secretive and mysteriously skilled white-haired Zhenjun who have also been drawn in...

The waters of this pond are too murky and dangerous.

In Pudu Zhenjun's eyes, Xiang Yunfan's actions were tantamount to placing himself in a gamble where death was nine times more likely than survival. To play such a dangerous card before his cultivation was deep enough was a sign of insufficient composure and an unstable Dao Heart.

Although he held some expectations for Xiang Yunfan, that was all there was to it. The Primordial Sect was a law of the jungle where the Dao path is arduous; each person's choices and life or death were left to their own fate.

He had no need to intervene, nor did he wish to intervene.

After the sigh, Pudu Zhenjun slowly closed his eyes, the aura around his body completely sinking into silence, as if his spirit had wandered into the Great Void, once again immersing himself in the endless deduction and meditation of the Great Dao, isolating himself from all the external disturbances.

At the mid-Core Formation stage, one no longer worried about lifespan, only seeking to ascend to the Great Dao, to achieve the perfection of the Great Heavenly Cycle. Perhaps, there was still a sliver of a chance at the Dao Embryo.

***

The Primordial Sect, the peak of Divine Thunder Mountain.

The pillar of purple-gold lightning still pierced the heavens, ceaseless day and night, proclaiming the identity of this place's master.

In the deepest part of the Divine Thunder Palace, Xiang Yunfan's main body was not, as the outside world perceived, in a state of spiritual wandering or secluded cultivation.

He sat cross-legged on a cloud platform, his eyes tightly shut, but at the center of his brows, a faintly flickering, extremely obscure purple-gold lightning rune could be seen.

Xiang Yunfan naturally did not separate his soul as the outside world believed. Instead, he used the "Xuandu Eight Sceneries Forging Heavenly Creation Cloud Sutra" combined with the strong control function of his Attribute Panel to lock the vast majority of his mind and will firmly onto his avatar, Sun Wukong, who was in the distant Samsara Sea of Suffering, through the channel connected to his origin.

It was only because of the Attribute Panel's miraculous ability to turn decay into magic that even Pudu Zhenjun, who had cultivated the Xuandu Eight Sceneries, absolutely could not see through that it was Xiang Yunfan's avatar that had gone.

At the same time, he secretly operated multiple karma secret arts, weaving them into an intangible and formless secret net that covered the entire Divine Thunder Mountain and the surrounding void. It keenly captured any abnormality in the heavens and earth, while also being specifically targeted at the qi fluctuations of this location.

The instant Tongxuan Zhenjun severed a part of his soul to leave it, the white-haired Zhenjun used his strange secret art to forcibly cross with his physical body, and Pudu Zhenjun let out his sigh, the karma threads under Xiang Yunfan's covered spiritual net violently trembled.

Several powerful, cold, greedy, and murderously sharp karma threads, like sharks smelling the scent of blood, suddenly tightened from different directions. Their ends pointed directly at the fluctuation source of Sun Wukong's entry into the Samsara Sea of Suffering.

Xiang Yunfan's tightly shut eyes suddenly snapped open.

His eyes were filled with nothing but cold indifference. Under his elevated line of sight, the several malevolent karma trajectories were clearly reflected before him.

The corner of his mouth twitched. He truly hadn't expected that his little performance would lure out quite a few people.

"Heh... as expected, they all came running at the scent of blood."

"Myriad Chariots' Tongxuan, let me see just how many other secretive old rats there are."

His gaze seemed to pierce through the restrictions of the Divine Thunder Palace, looking afar toward the direction of Mount Chenghua. That sigh seemed to have stirred a faint ripple in his heart, but it was instantly calm and undisturbed.
