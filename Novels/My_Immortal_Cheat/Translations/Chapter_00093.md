# Chapter 93: Upgrade

Feeling refreshed, Zhou Tian stretched lazily as he exited the tavern, Musu following closely behind.

"I will inform you if there is any news."

Musu's face remained expressionless; he turned and left after speaking. Zhou Tian smiled contentedly. After some discussion, Musu finally agreed to gather information for him. After this incident, Zhou Tian became even more certain that Musu was different from other Holy Divine Sect believers. He also knew that with the Holy Divine Sect's Divine Lord unresponsive to prayers for so long, the emergence of people like Musu was inevitable. Musu was certainly not the first Holy Divine Sect member to doubt their faith, nor would he be the last.

After finding another believer to promote his unique prayer method, Zhou Tian returned to his residence feeling refreshed. He opened his Undying System to check; he was three deaths away from upgrading, which would grant him another skill. He decided to wait and see what powerful skills would be available before making plans, which also aligned with waiting for Musu's news. Zhang Yi and the others' trial was scheduled before the next sunrise, which, according to Futian Province's calculations, was still about twelve or thirteen days away. There was no rush. In the following days, every time his resurrection count refreshed, Zhou Tian would go out to preach his unique prayer method.

Zhou Tian appeared in a secluded alley. Unlike his previous refreshed expressions, this time his brows were slightly furrowed.

"Have they already noticed? These people truly cannot be underestimated."

This journey of preaching his prayer method was not smooth; he had been ambushed. Although he preached in different, even distant, locations each time, he was still detected by members of the Holy Divine Sect. Everything had proceeded as planned until his revival, when a cage descended from the sky, trapping him inside. The cage radiated light, its runic chains connected, exuding a powerful aura. However, he had [Teleport]. Although their so-called [Six Staves of Light Prison] didn't seem ordinary, it wasn't enough to trap him.

"That bald bishop called me a Voodoo cultist. Can that Voodoo cult also resurrect people?"

Zhou Tian rubbed his brow. After he was trapped by the so-called [Six Staves of Light Prison], the bald bishop leading the group called him a Voodoo cultist and spouted a bunch of words he didn't understand. He didn't listen carefully and simply teleported out. Zhou Tian knew that resurrection was not a difficult feat in this world. For ordinary cultivators, as long as their soul remained intact, they could revive. And for top-tier experts, there were even methods to resurrect even if their soul was extinguished. It was even better if they misunderstood. Zhou Tian thought about it; having a sect take the blame for him seemed like a good thing. His mood immediately brightened.

Opening his Undying System, he saw a glittering golden light spot in the skill bar. His heart stirred, but now wasn't the time to check. Suppressing his excitement, he walked towards his residence.

Upon returning to his residence, Zhou Tian opened the skill bar. Immediately, three glittering skills appeared before his eyes. With practiced ease, he opened the first skill:

**[Attack Storage Rebound]:** Absorbs and stores an enemy's attack, nullifying that attack. The stored attack can be freely released by the host, but its power is reduced to 80% of its original strength. (Absorption Count: 15, related to death count)

This was a unique skill, combining both offense and defense. Although the rebounded attack only had 80% of its original power, it was still very strong. However, Zhou Tian currently wished for more decisive, kill-oriented skills that could directly eliminate enemies.

The second skill:

**[Eye of Truth]:** Detects information about anything. (Usage Count: 15, related to death count)

The second skill was an auxiliary ability. Its description was simple, yet it fully demonstrated its formidable power.

**[External Avatar]:** Creates an entirely new body. All parameters are set by the host. The host can control its life and death. (Occupies one resurrection chance)

There was a glittering exclamation mark at the end, indicating a special note. This skill surprised Zhou Tian, not just because of the note, but because it was the first skill that wasn't related to the death count, but rather to the resurrection count. Moreover, the skill description was interesting, using "occupies" instead of "consumes."

He clicked on the special note.

**[Note]:** All parameters refer to all physical parameters except cultivation base, including but not limited to appearance, height, aptitude, and even memory! "Occupies one resurrection chance" means that for as long as the External Avatar exists, one resurrection chance will be permanently occupied!

Heavens, this skill was extraordinary! It could even set aptitude, and more interestingly, memory. This meant he could create an avatar that wouldn't even know it was an avatar, and Zhou Tian would still control its life and death. That was truly fascinating. However, the phrase "occupies one resurrection chance" made Zhou Tian ponder even deeper. If a skill could occupy one resurrection chance, could there also be skills that occupied two? And if so, was there a way to increase his resurrection count? As his level increased, the death count required for the next upgrade had already reached sixteen. According to this calculation, leveling up in the later stages would take a very long time. Without a method to increase it, he could only grind slowly.

These thoughts flashed through his mind as he glanced at the three skills, finally focusing his attention on the first one.

**[Attack Storage Rebound] solidified!**

A surge of inexplicable information poured into his mind, giving him a deeper understanding of the skill. The way this skill stored attacks was as follows: if someone shot two arrows at him, those two arrows counted as two separate attacks. He could only store one arrow at a time, and only when it made contact with his body. Currently, he could store a total of 15 attacks. Furthermore, stored attacks had to be released within one day, or they would disappear the next day.

The other two skills transformed into dark light and vanished. Although [Eye of Truth] was powerful, it was ultimately an auxiliary skill and wouldn't immediately help him. [External Avatar] would definitely be incredible in the later stages, but it occupied a resurrection chance. He currently only had one resurrection chance; if it were occupied, what would he even do? So, only [Attack Storage Rebound] was suitable.

And now, the data within his Undying System had changed to this:

**Level 4: 0/16**
**Death Count: 15**

**[Teleport]:** Appears anywhere you desire, ignoring all blockades. (Range: 1500 meters, related to death count)
**[Holy Word]:** Words become law. Select a target and issue a command. Success rate is random; the more complex the command, the lower the success rate. Can be replaced by resurrection chances. (Usage Count: 15, related to death count)
**[Fire Blast]:** Summons a fireball to attack a designated target, dealing 5% of the target's HP as damage. Cannot be used on the same target multiple times within one day. (Daily Usage Count: 15, related to death count)
**[Attack Storage Rebound]:** Absorbs and stores an enemy's attack, nullifying that attack. The stored attack can be freely released by the host, but its power is reduced to 80% of its original strength. (Absorption Count: 15, related to death count)

Four skills, 15 death counts. His current stats were already somewhat impressive.
