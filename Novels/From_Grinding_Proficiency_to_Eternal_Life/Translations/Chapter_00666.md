# Chapter 666: Jiuyuan Xuansha Dongming Zhenjun

Just as he was contemplating how to probe for information from the other Zhenjun, the respectful, almost fanatical report of the peak's deacon disciple, Bi Yuan, came from outside the meditation room.

After all, a Zhenjun was present; merely getting to see one was a tremendous honor.

"Zhenjun, the chief disciple of Jiuyuan Zhenjun of Xuansha Mountain, Mo Du Zhenren, requests an audience. He says he bears the Zhenjun's decree, inviting you to Xuansha Mountain for a discussion."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. He slowly opened his eyes, the world of birth and death within his purple-gold lightning gaze gradually calming.

Jiuyuan Xuansha Dongming Zhenjun.

This Zhenjun held a unique position within the Primordial Origin Sect. She had once been Dao companions with Qingyuan Zhenjun, cultivating the Great Dao together. However, for reasons unknown, they later fell out completely, their enmity so deep that it was known to all within the Primordial Origin Sect.

When Qingyuan Zhenjun fell at his hands, this Dongming Zhenjun not only failed to appear to assist but secretly applauded the outcome. Her intentions were obvious.

Now that Qingyuan was dead, she was proactively inviting him...

"Perhaps building a connection with her could open up some局面 (situations). I might even gain some knowledge regarding cultivation after the Golden Core stage," Xu Yunfan mused.

Having become a Golden Core Zhenjun, his every move was under the scrutiny of others.

He truly wished to visit the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect to seek guidance from the Pure Yang Ancestor, Lu Chunyang, regarding his future path.

The Pure Yang Ancestor had恩 (favor) of imparting the Dao and protecting his path, and was also an Ancestor from the same Divine Martial Realm Dao Sect as him. Their bond was extraordinary.

But his identity was now different. He was Xu Yunfan, the newly ascended Zhenjun of Divine Thunder within the Primordial Origin Sect.

If his true body were to rashly step into the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's mountain gate, even with the Pure Yang Ancestor presiding, it would be hard to guarantee that the other Sword Sect masters who harbored hostility towards a "demon" from the Primordial Origin Sect wouldn't cause trouble.

If they took the opportunity to strike, even the Pure Yang Ancestor would find it difficult to fully protect him, and it might even trigger a direct conflict between the higher-ups of the two sects.

"Please wait a moment. This Seat will be right there."

Xu Yunfan's voice was calm, yet it penetrated the restrictions of the meditation room.

He retracted his surging aura, stabilizing the newly condensed Divine Thunder Golden Core within the core of his Dantian's Heavenly Cave. The phantom of the Golden Core had already solidified, radiating an eternal, indestructible Dao charm.

A moment later, Xu Yunfan, clad in a Dao robe of purple-gold with thunder patterns, appeared in the main hall of the Divine Thunder Peak.

In the hall, a man in a black Dao robe stood waiting quietly.

This person had a stern expression, his gaze sharp as an eagle's. The aura around him was heavy and obscure, as if it could freeze and suck in one's soul. He was a Great Zhenren at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm, Mo Du, famous in the Primordial Origin Sect for his vicious and powerful "Yin Binding Soul Hand."

Upon seeing Xu Yunfan appear, he immediately bowed respectfully. Facing a Zhenjun, any disrespect would mean a death without value. He might not even be able to reach the Sea of Suffering for reincarnation.

"Mo Du greets Divine Thunder Zhenjun! By my master's decree, Jiuyuan Xuansha Dongming Zhenjun, I have come especially to respectfully invite Zhenjun to Xuansha Mountain. My master said there are important matters to discuss, and also to congratulate Zhenjun on his Golden Core attainment."

Xu Yunfan's expression was indifferent. His gaze swept over Mo Du. The无形 (formless) pressure unique to a Golden Core Zhenjun made even this Great Zhenren at the peak of Foundation Establishment feel his breath catch.

Although he was at the peak of Foundation Establishment, only a step away from the Golden Core realm, he knew in his heart that this step was as wide as a heavenly chasm.

"Dongming Zhenjun is thoughtful. This Seat has just emerged from seclusion, so I shall accompany you to Xuansha Mountain."

He pretended to ponder for a moment before agreeing.

Now that he was a Zhenjun, he had the confidence to face Dongming, who was also at the initial stage of Golden Core.

Mo Du respectfully led the way.

Xu Yunfan transformed into a streak of purple-gold thunder light that tore through the sky. Carrying Mo Du, he shot towards one of the nine towering仙山 (immortal mountains) of the Primordial Origin Sect at a speed far beyond the imagination of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Xuansha Mountain.

The moment he entered the territory of Xuansha Mountain, a vast, chilling, and profound aura, completely different from the vast thunder of Divine Thunder Peak or the clear immortal qi of Qingyuan Mountain, enveloped him. It felt as if it could pierce through the nine hells of the human heart.

This was the Dao field of Jiuyuan Xuansha Dongming Zhenjun, the concrete extension of the Dao she walked.

The entire Xuansha Mountain was not made of ordinary rock but a strange material resembling jade and bone, flowing with a dim, gloomy light.

No sunlight reached the mountain; only幽 blue (ghostly blue) phosphorescent fires and deep purple煞 mist (evil mist) swirled and rose, casting the space in a grotesque, kaleidoscopic light.

Every blade of grass and tree was not a real plant.

The swaying grass was actually strands of pure Nine Nether Yin Qi condensed together.

The gnarled, twisting trees were solidified, entangled怨魂 (resentful soul) and煞念 (evil thoughts). Between the branches, shrill wails occasionally sounded, only to be forcibly suppressed by a deeper, more幽 dark force.

The stream flowing through the mountain gorge was viscous as ink, a true玄煞 water (mysterious evil water) that emitted a bone-piercing chill. Within the water, intangible faces could be seen struggling and sinking.

The air was弥漫 (permeated) with a strange Dao charm that stirred the soul and seemed to allow one to peer into the darkest corners of one's heart.

A classic demonic path method.

This was the Dao of Jiuyuan Xuansha Dongming Zhenjun.

Penetrating the underworld, manipulating the human heart, and驾驭 (commanding) the power of the Nine Nether's mysterious evil.

The entire Xuansha Mountain was the projection and extension of her vast Heavenly Cave in the mortal world, the manifestation of her Golden Core image: "Nine Nether Mysterious Evil · Insight into All Thoughts."

Where a Zhenjun resides, the天地 (heaven and earth) of their Dao field is influenced by their image. Here, her own power would be greatly amplified.

"So that's how it is. The image can be used in this way."

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly, and he gained a bit of enlightenment.

When he had previously visited Qingyuan Zhenjun's Dao field on Qingyuan Mountain, he saw mountains as mountains and waters as waters.

Now, he saw mountains that were not mountains and waters that were not waters.

Xu Yunfan's Divine Thunder Dao Body instinctively operated. Purple-gold lightning flowed over his skin, and the Dao charm of his Thunder, which could destroy all laws, automatically resisted the cold, Yin spiritual sense that was trying to seep in and probe the fluctuations of his mind.

He could feel that within this mountain, in countless hidden corners, it seemed as if Dongming Zhenjun's eyes were watching his every move, and even the flow of his thoughts.

But the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit he had formed, condensing all kinds of thunder, feared no such Yin attribute power the most.

He continued forward.

Mo Du led Xu Yunfan to a strangely styled, elegant hall at the mountain's peak.

The hall was built on a foundation of black jade, with white jade beams. Hanging from the eaves were lanterns made of solidified soul-fire, emitting a幽幽 (faint) green light.

As soon as the light fell upon Xu Yunfan, he felt his soul become noticeably more stable.

What a fine treasure!

Xu Yunfan's eyes lit up. As a master craftsman of the highest level, he knew this item was an extremely rare heavenly treasure. He never expected it to be used as a lantern.

He couldn't help but sigh inwardly that he had been a Zhenjun for too short a time and his foundation was too thin.

He must find an opportunity to borrow it for a closer look someday.

The hall doors opened silently, and Zhenren Mo Du retreated without a word.

A glance inside revealed it was not resplendent with gold and jade but was tastefully decorated. There were tables of black jade and chairs carved with white jade flowers. On the walls hung scrolls depicting the grotesque and bizarre scenes of the underworld.

In the center of the hall, a woman with a graceful and enchanting figure was lazily reclining on a soft couch covered in the pelt of some rare and exotic beast.

She wore only a layer of nearly transparent thin gauze, her naked body appearing and disappearing within it, her curves breathtaking.

Her skin was white as jade, yet it shimmered with a strange, cold light.

Her face was exceptionally beautiful, carrying a charm that could turn the world upside down. Especially her eyes, deep as an abyss; when her gaze rippled, it seemed as if they could suck in a person's soul, penetrating the deepest secrets and desires of one's heart.
