# Chapter 476: Sense of Crisis

When Xu Yunfan returned to Cold Crow Pass, he stood atop the Black Profound Pavilion and glanced down at the bustling market below.借助寒鸦关内玄冥七煞阵仔细感应一番，确定没什么大事，暗地里也不过蝇营狗苟后便不再关注。Using his spiritual sense through the Black Profound Seven Killing Array within Cold Crow Pass, he carefully sensed his surroundings. Confirming that there were no major incidents and that the underhanded dealings were merely trivial, he paid it no further mind.

能成修仙者都不是蠢笨之人，只要自己不瞎指挥，只用顾着收税便成。Those who can become cultivators are not foolish people. As long as he didn't give foolish commands and only focused on collecting taxes, it would suffice.

他首要之事便是闭关。His first priority was to go into seclusion.

筑基中期的境界虽已水到渠成，但此番炼化北斗紫微天罡的剧烈消耗与道躯、经络的反复破碎重塑，仍需时日彻底沉淀稳固。Although reaching the Mid Foundation Establishment realm had been a natural progression, the violent consumption from refining the Big Dipper Purple Micro Heavenly Gang, along with the repeated shattering and reconstruction of his Dao Body and meridians, still needed time to completely settle and stabilize.

属性面板成就境界下虽然一证永证。Under the achievement-based realm of the Attribute Panel, once a realm was proven, it was proven forever.

成就筑基中期后，个中玄妙已了然于心，但他有人暗中关注，他自然不会如此表现。After achieving Mid Foundation Establishment, he understood all its subtleties in his heart. However, since someone was secretly watching him, he naturally wouldn't show his true hand.

该走的流程还是得走。The necessary procedures still had to be gone through.

徐云帆盘坐于聚灵阵眼，《真武伏魔真经》缓缓运转，丹田中四道神通，以核心神通北极紫微镇煞玄炁构成的循环如星辰轮转，精纯的法力奔涌不息，不断蕴养着法躯，将那丝源自帝星罡煞的星辰琉璃质感彻底融入四肢百骸。Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged at the eye of the Spirit Gathering Array. The *True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra* slowly circulated. Within his Dantian, four divine abilities formed a cycle, with the core divine ability, the North Pole Purple Micro Suppressing Evil Profound Qi, acting like a revolving star. Pure spiritual power surged endlessly, continuously nurturing his magical body and completely integrating the trace of starry, glass-like texture from the Imperial Star's Gang Evil into his four limbs and hundred bones.

北极紫微镇煞玄炁特有的淡紫清辉流转全身，将体内残余的些微劫煞之力不断磨灭、吸收，反哺道基。The unique, faint purple light of the North Pole Purple Micro Suppressing Evil Profound Qi circulated throughout his body, continuously grinding down and absorbing the residual minor Tribulation Evil power within him, nourishing his Dao Foundation in return.

视界内虽无熟练度提示刷屏，但徐云帆能清晰感知，自身的根基正变得前所未有的厚实坚固，远比寻常筑基中期修士强大。Although no proficiency prompts were flooding his vision, Xu Yunfan could clearly perceive that his foundation was becoming unprecedentedly solid and robust, far more powerful than an ordinary Mid Foundation Establishment cultivator.

而且北极紫微镇煞玄炁对他各项增益极大，这门神通能将原本的各项数值增幅至一倍以上。Moreover, the North Pole Purple Micro Suppressing Evil Profound Qi provided him with immense boosts. This divine ability could amplify his original stats by more than a fold.

这是一个相当恐怖的数值。This was a相当恐怖的数值.

无愧为神通之名，无愧为星外北斗紫微罡煞。Truly worthy of the name 'divine ability,' truly worthy of the Extra-stellar Big Dipper Purple Micro Heavenly Gang.

至少在筑基中期，有北极紫微镇煞玄炁这门神通作保，他说第二，有人敢称呼第一还得看他拳头答不答应。At least in Mid Foundation Establishment, with the North Pole Purple Micro Suppressing Evil Profound Qi as his guarantee, if he said he was second, anyone who dared to claim first would have to see if his fist agreed.

当然，装模作样修为稳固的同时，他并未忽视另一件迫在眉睫之事。Of course, while pretending to stabilize his cultivation, he did not neglect another urgent matter.

资源亏空。The resource deficit.

炼制云笈化身韩石，耗费了这些年在寒鸦关贪墨积攒的庞大珍材，这消耗远超预期。Refining the Cloud Chest Clone, Han Shi, had consumed the vast treasures he had embezzled and accumulated over the years at Cold Crow Pass. This consumption far exceeded his expectations.

寒鸦关地处北洲边界，与万乘剑宗和菩禅净土遥望，是三家资源汇集之地，每年经手的“过关税”和特产交易税颇为可观。Cold Crow Pass was located on the border of the North Continent, facing the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Bodhi Pure Land from afar. It was a place where the resources of the three factions converged. The 'Passage Tax' and the special product transaction taxes handled annually were quite substantial.

而且自从徐云帆上任后，各种赋税琳琅满目，若非空气税委实离谱，徐云帆都想立个名目。Furthermore, since Xu Yunfan took office, the variety of taxes had been dazzling. If it weren't for the fact that an 'air tax' was truly too absurd, Xu Yunfan would have wanted to establish one.

虽然赋税种类繁多，但徐云帆终究把持在一个限度，这也是为何寒鸦关内的坊市交易蒸蒸日上。Although the types of taxes were numerous, Xu Yunfan ultimately kept them within a limit. This was also why the market transactions within Cold Crow Pass were flourishing.

毕竟再如何割韭菜，也得留空间让韭菜生长起来才行。After all, no matter how much you cut the leeks, you have to leave space for them to grow.

待得徐云帆第一次出关后，以保管职责为由，悄然介入关内资源库房的核查盘点。After Xu Yunfan emerged from seclusion for the first time, under the pretext of his duty of safekeeping, he quietly intervened in the verification and inventory of the pass's resource storerooms.

他行事缜密，手段老练，以修缮戍堡阵法、巩固跨界通道等名目，将关内积攒十五年的税收灵石、以及库房中几件不算显眼却也蕴含精纯金铁之气、适合作为《玄都八景炼天造化云笈》材料的法器“合规”调拨，不动声色地填补了炼制分身的巨大窟窿。He acted meticulously and with seasoned skill. Using pretexts like repairing the garrison fortress array and reinforcing the cross-realm passage, he 'compliantly' allocated the tax spirit stones accumulated over fifteen years in the pass, along with several unremarkable artifacts in the storeroom that contained pure metal qi and were suitable as materials for the *Mysterious Capital Eight Scenes Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Chest*. He silently filled the huge gap left by refining his clone.

这个过程持续了足五年时间，其间他深居简出，只在处理公务时露面，以免节外生枝。This process lasted a full five years. During this time, he lived in seclusion and only appeared when handling official business to avoid any complications.

这才在上供缴纳时，堪堪补齐数额。It was only then, when submitting the tribute, that he barely made up the required amount.

这一日，徐云帆正于石殿偏厅整理近期库房账目，一股厚如山岳、沉凝精纯的灵压倏然笼罩了整个寒鸦关。On this day, while Xu Yunfan was organizing the recent storeroom accounts in the stone hall's side chamber, a thick, mountain-like, and heavy, pure spiritual pressure suddenly enveloped the entire Cold Crow Pass.

关内底层修士无不噤若寒蝉。The low-level cultivators in the pass were all frozen in terror.

徐云帆心中微凛，放下手中书册，抬眼望去。Xu Yunfan's heart tightened slightly. He put down the book in his hand and looked up.

门口光影一暗，一位身着赭黄道袍、面容俊朗的青年道人已含笑立于殿中。The light and shadow at the doorway darkened. A young Taoist priest, dressed in a brownish-yellow Taoist robe with a handsome face, was already standing in the hall with a smile.

他身形不高却自有渊渟岳峙之威，正是当初接引他入清源真君座下、布置“洞天嫁接之术”任务的百岳真人。Although his stature was not tall, he possessed an imposing presence like a deep abyss or a towering mountain. It was none other than Hundred Peaks True Person, who had originally guided him under Lord Qingyuan and assigned the task of the 'Heavenly Realm Grafting Technique.'

筑基圆满境界的浩瀚法力虽含而不露，却让殿内空气都仿佛凝滞了几分。Although the vast spiritual power of the Peak Foundation Establishment realm was restrained, it made the air in the hall seem to stagnate.

“云帆见过师兄！” "Yunfan greets Senior Brother!"

徐云帆瞬间起身，脸上恰到好处地浮现出三分惊讶七分惊喜，快步上前深深一揖，“楚师兄光临寒鸦关，实令此荒僻之地蓬荜生辉！师弟未能远迎，还望师兄见谅。” Xu Yunfan instantly rose to his feet. An expression of three parts surprise and seven parts delight appeared on his face just right. He quickly stepped forward and bowed deeply. "Senior Brother Chu's arrival at Cold Crow Pass truly makes this remote place shine with glory! This Junior Brother failed to greet you from afar. I hope you can forgive me, Senior Brother."

语气真挚，动作一丝不苟，饱含情深。His tone was sincere, his actions meticulous, and full of deep feeling.

不知道的还以为徐云帆是遇上了血脉相容的至亲。Anyone who didn't know better would think Xu Yunfan had met a blood-related, intimate family member.

百岳真人捋须微笑，目光如温润古玉般在徐云帆身上一扫，眼中掠过一丝不易察觉的满意：“呵呵，师弟不必多礼。戍守此地十数载，辛苦你了，此地终究是北洲边陲，又与万乘剑宗和菩禅净土接壤，要是有些剑疯子脑抽跑过来，也是件头疼的事情。” Hundred Peaks True Person stroked his beard and smiled. His gaze, like warm, ancient jade, swept over Xu Yunfan, and a barely perceptible hint of satisfaction flashed in his eyes. "Haha, Junior Brother, there's no need for such formality. You've been guarding this place for over a decade, it's been hard work. This place is, after all, the frontier of the North Continent, bordering the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Bodhi Pure Land. If some sword maniacs had a brain fog and ran over, it would be a headache."

万乘剑宗为剑修宗门，其内剑道凝聚太华灵墟界中，极于剑者，本就偏执才会能孕育出剑胎。The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect is a sword cultivator sect. Its sword Dao within the Great Wasteland Spirit Ruins World is condensed. Those who are extreme in the sword are inherently paranoid; it is only through such obsession that a sword embryo can be nurtured.

他顿了顿，笑容更温和了几分，“方才神念扫过，观你气息圆融凝练，锋芒内敛却又厚重如渊，看来神武界一行收获匪浅，竟一举冲破壁垒，臻至筑基中期之境！妙哉！当年真君将你安排在此地砥砺道心，果然是慧眼如炬。如此进境，当为我宗年轻一辈翘楚了。” He paused, and his smile became even gentler. "Just now, my divine sense swept over you. I observed that your aura is harmonious and condensed, your edge is retracted yet you are as profound and heavy as an abyss. It seems your trip to the Divine Martial World was immensely fruitful. To think you broke through the barrier in one go and reached the Mid Foundation Establishment realm! Wonderful! It is truly as the Lord foresight when he arranged for you to be here to temper your Dao Heart all those years ago. Such progress makes you the leading figure among our sect's younger generation."

这番赞赏发自肺腑，徐云帆的修为精进之速，确实出乎他意料。This praise came from the heart. The speed of Xu Yunfan's cultivation progress had indeed exceeded his expectations.

徐云帆连忙低头，脸上带着些许“惭愧”：“师弟谬赞了，师弟不过是侥得天幸，恰逢神武界中一桩机缘，借力突破罢了。若无宗门栽培，若无师兄安排我驻守寒鸦关，得了些资源，弟子此刻怕仍在筑基初期蹉跎，焉能有今日？这点微末成就，怎敢当‘翘楚’二字，全赖宗门底蕴深厚，真君赏赐，师兄提携之恩。” Xu Yunfan quickly lowered his head, a hint of 'shame' on his face. "You flatter me, Senior Brother. This Junior Brother was merely lucky and happened upon an opportunity in the Divine Martial World, borrowing its power to break through. If not for the sect's nurturing, if not for Senior Brother arranging for me to guard Cold Crow Pass and gain some resources, this disciple would likely still be languishing in early Foundation Establishment today. How could I have this day? Such a trivial achievement dares not be called 'the leading figure.' It all relies on the sect's deep foundation, the Lord's rewards, and the grace of Senior Brother's guidance."

言辞恳切，将功劳归功于宗门与百岳真人，更归功于清源真君。His words were earnest, attributing the credit to the sect and Hundred Peaks True Person, and even more so to Lord Qingyuan.

百岳真人显然很受用这番谦逊之词，笑容更盛：“嗯，不骄不躁，道心沉稳，甚好。既然你已稳固筑基中期境界，根基坚实如斯……” Hundred Peaks True Person clearly enjoyed these humble words, and his smile grew even wider. "Hmm, not arrogant, not rash, your Dao Heart is steady. Very good. Since you have already stabilized your Mid Foundation Establishment realm and your foundation is so solid..."

他话锋一转，语气变得郑重了几分，“是时候该将凝练自身洞天之事提上日程了。那方神武小界天，正可助你完成这筑基之中至关重要的一步。我之前所授那‘洞天嫁接之术’，你参悟得如何了？可有什么凝滞不通之处？” His tone shifted, becoming more solemn. "It is time to put the matter of condensing your own Heavenly Realm on the agenda. That small Divine Martial World can help you complete this crucial step within Foundation Establishment. How is your comprehension of the 'Heavenly Realm Grafting Technique' I taught you before? Are there any parts where you are stuck or find unclear?"

这是来检查他功课了？Was he here to check on his homework?

不，是来催促他赶紧修行这门洞天嫁接之法的。No, he was here to urge him to quickly practice this Heavenly Realm Grafting Technique.

此番百岳真人前来，怕也是授了清源真君的意思。Hundred Peaks True Person's visit this time was likely at the behest of Lord Qingyuan.

为何如此等不及了？Why were they in such a hurry?

徐云帆心中警兆骤升，面上却分毫不显，反而立刻浮现出感激与一丝遇到难题的困惑：“师兄所赐神术玄奥莫测，师弟日夜参研，不敢懈怠。只是…” Xu Yunfan's heart gave a sudden warning, but not a hint of it showed on his face. Instead, he immediately expressed gratitude and a hint of confusion over a difficult problem. "The divine art you bestowed, Senior Brother, is abstruse and immeasurable. This Junior Brother has studied it day and night, not daring to be lazy. It's just that..."
