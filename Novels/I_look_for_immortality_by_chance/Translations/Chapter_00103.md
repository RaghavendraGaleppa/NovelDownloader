# Chapter 103: Stop! Senior Brother Gu, You've Won! (Combined)

In the tranquil valley, a fierce battle erupted instantly.

Senior Brother Deng, fearing Junior Brother Yun might be no match for Gu Yuan, acted decisively and ruthlessly. His powerful spiritual sense and seals surged forth, targeting Bian Chuyao.

Bian Chuyao smiled faintly, appearing unfazed as she wielded a crimson flame whip to meet his assault.

Spiritual energy raged, and the roar of battle intensified as their duel grew increasingly fierce.

Yet Gu Yuan only glanced briefly before being forced to retreat by the onslaught, unable to focus on the larger situation.

"Your opponent is me!"

"Senior Brother Gu, even if you possess supreme-grade spiritual sense, I won't lose to you!"

"Combat isn't just about spiritual sense!"

Junior Brother Yun's expression was resolute, his lips pressed tightly together as he coldly addressed Gu Yuan.

With a flick of his finger, a golden seal shot forth. The surrounding spiritual energy surged like tidal waves before a deafening explosion erupted—a golden lightning bolt flashed out of nowhere, striking toward Gu Yuan.

Not stopping there, another crimson seal in his palm glowed brilliantly, channeling the scorching power of fire veins into a raging inferno that swept toward Gu Yuan.

Earthfire and Golden Thunder.

Both were seals specializing in overwhelming offense. When unleashed together, their combined might resembled divine punishment—utterly devastating.

*Clang!*

Seeing this, Gu Yuan focused his mind, and the Qinglian Seal instantly brightened. Golden lotus petals bloomed beneath his feet, forming layers of barriers to meet the incoming earthfire and golden thunder.

*Boom!*

Junior Brother Yun truly lived up to his reputation as a combat prodigy among the common disciples of Luoxia Sect. The two seals, drawing upon the power of heaven and earth, caused the Qinglian Seal to tremble under their might, its petals shattering one after another as if unable to withstand the assault.

But at that moment, the Minor Titan Seal in Gu Yuan's dantian flickered faintly. Instantly, the entire Qinglian Seal was bathed in golden light, its petals transforming into radiant gold, gleaming like forged metal.

*Boom!*

Thunder and fire struck again, but true gold fears no fire.

With his hands behind his back, Gu Yuan stood calmly within the golden lotus petals, unmoved by the roaring tempest outside.

"Go!"

Seeing this, Junior Brother Yun's heart sank. Without hesitation, he flung out a cyan seal, which shot toward Gu Yuan like lightning.

The seal was blindingly fast, striking the Qinglian Seal in an instant.

*Thud!*

Like a sharp blade cutting through iron, the previously indestructible golden petals shattered under the cyan light. The seal's momentum didn't falter, continuing straight toward Gu Yuan's neck.

*Clang!*

But just then, pink peach blossoms suddenly drifted down before Gu Yuan, falling like a gentle rain—beautiful yet deadly.

To anyone caught within, the danger was palpable.

Threads of sword energy hummed incessantly, forming an inescapable net that trapped the cyan seal in midair. The seal resembled a cyan flying dagger, inscribed with ancient script, struggling to break free but constantly thwarted by the sword energy.

"The Peach Blossom Sword Seal has such power? You consumed Golden-Severing Mystic Grass?"

Feeling the overwhelming sword energy, Junior Brother Yun's expression changed again.

He had already unleashed several formidable techniques, yet his opponent hadn't even taken a single step—clearly holding back.

His face darkened with uncertainty, and he began to doubt the success of their mission.

Gu Yuan, however, seemed distracted. Only now did he turn his head and reply with a smile, "Merely a gift from Junior Sister Bian."

Hearing this, Junior Brother Yun took a deep breath, his expression turning grave as if recalling something.

"I also received Senior Brother Deng's rewards in the Zhongshan Secret Realm. I thought I wouldn't need them, but it seems I must use them today. I hope Senior Brother Gu will enlighten me!"

As he spoke, his face paled drastically, as if all his spiritual energy had been drained.

*Boom!*

A black storm cloud materialized above the valley, crackling with golden lightning, its thunder deafening.

*Roar!*

But at that moment, Gu Yuan's spiritual sense suddenly expanded. The silver dragon coiled around him shone brilliantly, its scales radiating light as it roared and shot straight through the Crimson Cloud Fire Crow, invading Junior Brother Yun's consciousness.

Junior Brother Yun's face twisted in shock. Golden light flickered in his eyes as he tried to resist, but suddenly, thick mist and surging water vapor obscured his senses and vision.

Before he could react, a cold, sharp edge pressed against his neck, sending chills down his spine.

"Junior Brother Yun truly lives up to Luoxia Sect's reputation. However, the Cloud Mist Valley is a place of beauty—let's not disturb it with such violent thunder. I'll seek your guidance another time..."

Gu Yuan's voice echoed in his ears through the mist, freezing him in place.

But with the silver dragon prowling in his consciousness and the icy sword energy at his throat, he could only sigh in resignation, withdrawing his spiritual energy from the seal and allowing the storm to dissipate.

Seeing this, Gu Yuan chuckled in satisfaction.

This thunder-summoning technique was clearly similar to his own Secret Origin Commanding Arrow—a powerful, charge-based seal with immense destructive potential but a lengthy casting time. Against an evenly matched opponent, it could be a trump card, but against someone vastly superior, it was nearly useless.

Gu Yuan had other plans and didn't want to waste effort here, so he decisively subdued Junior Brother Yun to avoid further conflict.

"Senior Brother Gu's skills are truly impressive. In that case, I shall withdraw from Cloud Mist Valley..."

Though unwilling, Junior Brother Yun understood the gap between them. Despite letting Senior Brother Deng down, he had done his best.

With that, he took out his Azure Jade Token, activated it, and gradually vanished from the valley.

Watching this, Gu Yuan smirked but didn't dispel the Mist-Walking Seal. Instead, he intensified the fog, obscuring himself further while manipulating spiritual energy to simulate an ongoing battle.

---

Meanwhile, on the other side of the valley, Bian Chuyao and Senior Brother Deng's duel had reached its climax.

Senior Brother Deng's hair billowed as lightning flickered in his eyes, his aura domineering.

Bian Chuyao, gripping her crimson fire whip, wore a grave expression.

"Junior Sister Bian, you come from a great clan, blessed with talent and countless techniques. In the past, I could never have defeated you."

"But you've spent your days meditating in your family's halls, never venturing out to fight. You likely have no idea how the world has changed..."

"Our Luoxia Sect has battled for years in the Thunder Peaks. Even several core disciples have fallen—only the strongest survive."

"I've fought demons in the mountains for years, engaged in hundreds of battles, walked through blood and corpses, and seized countless opportunities. Do you think the seals gifted by your clan alone can defeat me?"

Senior Brother Deng strode forward, his eyes blazing with lightning, as countless golden serpents of thunder surged toward Bian Chuyao.

Bian Chuyao paled, her eyes flickering with panic as she glanced toward the mist-covered battlefield.

Within the mist, spiritual energy churned violently—the battle there still seemed ongoing.

*That scoundrel! He spoke so confidently before the fight, yet now he can't even defeat a common disciple from Luoxia Sect?*

Gritting her teeth, Bian Chuyao refused to admit defeat. With a wave of her hand, she summoned the last seal stored in her dantian.

"Senior Brother Deng, don't think I fear you!"

*Roar!*

Golden flames coalesced into the form of a dragon, its scales and whiskers flickering with embers, nearly tangible as it lunged at Senior Brother Deng.

But Senior Brother Deng pointed skyward, summoning golden lightning that shattered the fire dragon in moments, scattering its embers.

Bian Chuyao's face turned ashen. She seemed unable to accept this outcome, but Senior Brother Deng pressed forward relentlessly. His golden thunderbolts shattered her defensive seals, even severing strands of her hair.

"Gu Yuan, why aren't you helping?!" she cried out in desperation.

But the mist remained turbulent, offering no reply.

"Junior Brother Yun may lack spiritual sense, but his skills are nearly on par with mine. Even if your Senior Brother Gu wins, it won't be easy."

"Take out your Azure Jade Token and return to the mountain. This victory is mine!"

Seeing the battle in the mist still raging, Senior Brother Deng relaxed slightly, pressuring Bian Chuyao further.

Though pale-faced, Bian Chuyao refused to concede, her gaze fixed on the mist. *Had that scoundrel truly failed?*

"Junior Sister Bian, don't force my hand. Do you truly wish for our sects to become enemies?"

Senior Brother Deng's expression darkened as lightning coiled around Bian Chuyao.

With no other choice, she sighed and retrieved her token, vanishing from the valley. But her final words were icy:

"Senior Brother Gu is someone my Bian Clan favors. Senior Brother Deng, don't overstep..."

---

Watching Bian Chuyao disappear, Senior Brother Deng smirked in triumph.

"This victory is mine!"

After regaining his breath, he strode confidently into the mist.

*Whoosh!*

But the moment he entered, his expression shifted.

"Such a potent concealment technique—even my spiritual sense can't penetrate it!"

A golden lightning aura coiled around him, probing his surroundings. Normally effective within thirty meters, his spiritual sense was now confined to a mere three meters.

Undeterred, he pressed forward, calling out:

"Junior Brother Yun, don't worry! I've defeated Bian Chuyao and am coming to aid you!"

*Clang!*

But suddenly, amidst the mist and rain, dazzling sword energy surged toward him like a storm of peach blossoms.

"He still has strength to fight me?"

Alarm flashed across Senior Brother Deng's face as the sword energy closed in.

"Golden Serpent Shield Seal!"

With a sweep of his sleeve, a golden seal materialized, forming a three-meter-long serpentine barrier around him. Its scales gleamed, seemingly impervious.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Countless sword strikes rained down, but the serpent's scales repelled them effortlessly, even devouring some of the energy.

But then, the mist thickened further. The downpour intensified, eroding all foreign energy within.

The sword energy coalesced into a massive, radiant peach blossom, spinning toward Senior Brother Deng with lethal intent.

Before it even struck, the golden serpent's glow dimmed under the oppressive rain.

Senior Brother Deng's unease grew.

*Junior Brother Yun is no ordinary disciple. There's no way that 'Senior Brother Gu' could suppress us both. Something's wrong.*

"Thousand Lightning Serpent Seal!"

"Three Flames True Seal!"

"Thunderfire Twinborn Seal!"

Without hesitation, he activated three powerful seals—some sect treasures, others his own hard-won techniques.

*Boom! Boom!*

Thunder and fire erupted in a cataclysmic explosion, shredding through the mist and sword energy.

As the fog cleared, a handsome, composed figure emerged.

"So it's just you! Where's Junior Brother Yun?!" Senior Brother Deng demanded.

But before he finished speaking, his eyes locked onto an arrow-shaped glow in Gu Yuan's palm.

One hundred and twenty glowing runes pulsed like molten lava, radiating terrifying power.

"Secret Origin Commanding Arrow?!" he gasped.

"Fall!"

Reacting instantly, Senior Brother Deng summoned golden lightning from the sky, aiming to strike Gu Yuan down.

"To defeat Bian Chuyao, you must have some skill..."

Gu Yuan mused.

After subduing Junior Brother Yun, he had been charging the Secret Origin Commanding Arrow. But Senior Brother Deng was formidable—he'd broken through the Mist-Walking Seal enhanced by the Minor Titan Seal in mere moments, forcing Gu Yuan to reveal himself. With the lightning closing in, he could charge no further.

"Go!"

With no other choice, Gu Yuan released the arrow.

*Boom!*

The crimson projectile streaked across the sky like a meteor, its power overwhelming.

Senior Brother Deng's face tightened, but he didn't panic.

He channeled all his energy into a golden seal in his dantian.

*Boom!*

The seal ignited, summoning a golden lightning bolt that struck him instantly, encasing him in radiant armor.

*Boom!*

The arrow collided with devastating force, but the golden armor held firm.

When the dust settled, Senior Brother Deng stood pale but unharmed, his armor dim yet intact.

A smirk tugged at his lips.

"Your skills are impressive. Even some core disciples might struggle against you. But to defeat me—"

*Thud!*

A fist the size of a sand pot, wreathed in icy blue energy, slammed into him.

Even with the armor, Senior Brother Deng staggered.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*

The assault didn't stop.

Frozen fists rained down like hail, each strike brutal. Icy energy seeped through the armor, numbing his body and spirit.

*Crack!*

Within seconds, the golden armor shattered, revealing Senior Brother Deng's terrified face.

"Stop! Stop!"

"Senior Brother Gu, you've won! You've won!"
