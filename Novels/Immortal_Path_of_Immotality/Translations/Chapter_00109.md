# Chapter 109: Wind Thunder Technique

Three days later.

After purifying himself with incense and adjusting his essence, energy, and spirit to their optimal state, Lin Shan was fully prepared.

"Let's hope this doesn't disappoint me."

After briefly admiring the Foundation Establishment Pill, Lin Shan didn't hesitate any longer and swallowed it in one gulp.

In a daze, he felt countless streams of spiritual energy emerging from throughout his body, converging like countless small rivers into the sea, forming a massive vortex in his dantian.

As the vortex spun, a powerful column of spiritual energy surged upward from its center, vaguely aiming for an inexplicable point in the void of his dantian—where the mysterious Xuan Guan acupoint lay, an insurmountable chasm that had blocked countless cultivators seeking immortality since ancient times.

His mind was in a muddled state as he let his dantian break through the barrier. Meanwhile, his divine consciousness spread evenly throughout his body, gathering and dispersing freely at will.

He didn't know how much time had passed before his divine consciousness merged back into the dantian vortex, undergoing an indescribable transformation as it was continuously tempered by the massive spiritual energy whirlpool.

One day,  
Three days,  
Ten days,  
…

During this time, when he felt hunger pangs, he briefly regained awareness to take out the prepared "Fasting Pills" to stave off hunger before immediately immersing himself back into the process of mental transformation and the fusion of energy and spirit.

His divine consciousness gradually synchronized with his wind-attribute spiritual energy, allowing him to manipulate the spiritual energy vortex in his dantian as effortlessly as moving his own limbs. He could even harness the energy to assault the Foundation Establishment barrier.

A hundred days passed in the blink of an eye.

This breakthrough attempt fully demonstrated the sturdiness and depth of the Foundation Establishment barrier, as well as the prolonged nature of the fusion between energy and spirit.

When Lin Shan awoke as if from a dream, he found that his way of perceiving the world had fundamentally changed.

Previously, he had relied on his eyes to see, his ears to hear, and his spiritual senses to vaguely perceive his surroundings.

But now, he discovered that his divine consciousness could freely leave his body, monitoring every movement within a hundred-meter radius—even the flow and changes of the five elemental spiritual energies in the world.

This was divine consciousness projection.

A defining characteristic exclusive to Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Lin Shan immediately inspected his dantian and found that not only had its capacity expanded more than tenfold, but the previously stagnant sea of energy had also transformed into a stable, slowly rotating vortex.

This vortex encompassed his entire dantian, resembling the swirling galaxies he had seen in his previous life—breathtakingly beautiful and mysteriously magnificent, representing the first major milestone on the path of immortality in the civilization of cultivation!

Compared to mortals and Qi Refining cultivators, Foundation Establishment practitioners enjoyed doubled lifespans, living nearly two hundred years.

Lin Shan was only about twenty years old now, having consumed barely a tenth of his lifespan. This meant he had ample time to refine his Foundation Establishment and even aspire to reach the Golden Core stage.

Moreover, because he had broken through to Foundation Establishment while still in his youth, the proportional reduction of his consumed lifespan had subtly restored his appearance to that of a teenager!

---

In the cultivation world, one's appearance was directly linked to their remaining lifespan ratio. If someone broke through to Foundation Establishment in their seventies or eighties, they would revert to a middle-aged appearance.

If they barely managed the breakthrough on their deathbed nearing a hundred years old, they might appear somewhat younger but would still look like someone past fifty.

"So... I've turned back into a dashing young man?"

Lin Shan left his cultivation chamber and went to the courtyard of his cave abode, examining his reflection in the pond.

His face was as fair as jade, brimming with vigor, with a touch of youthful innocence in his features—what a dashing young man in white robes!

"If I can reach Golden Core before thirty-two, wouldn't I turn into a child?!"

The more he thought about it, the weirder it seemed. Based on his current experience, Lin Shan analyzed that the legendary "rejuvenation" might indeed be real!

If a cultivator progressed slowly in the early stages but accumulated strength for a sudden leap later, their appearance might change repeatedly—from old age to middle age, then to youth, then to adolescence, ultimately achieving true rejuvenation!

"Tsk tsk!"

He marveled inwardly at the wonders of the Dao of Immortality. The civilization of cultivation truly produced legends that shone through the ages. He couldn't help but wonder—what did the Buddha of the immortal realm look like?

Judging by the golden Buddha statues, it was hard to tell whether they depicted middle age or old age.

But he clearly knew that among some worshipped Bodhisattvas and Arhats, certain divine golden bodies were unmistakably in the form of "children"!

This implied that these revered Buddhist figures in the mortal realm were likely true titans of the immortal world.

"Better not provoke them..."

Lin Shan had always maintained reverence for genuine great beings like the Buddha. Although he had improved more than tenfold, in their eyes, he remained an insignificant ant whose size was hardly worth noting.

If he wanted to intercept faith, he'd better stick to targeting "fake Buddhas" like the Black Lotus Buddha or the Joy Buddha in the mortal realm. At least their backers couldn't reach across the void to eliminate him.

"Buddhism is the most obsessed with faith. Daoism, Confucianism, Demonic Path—these chaotic cultivators all believe in 'my fate is mine to command.' If you want to profit from them, you'd have to target their sect's treasures or proselytizing artifacts..."

Rubbing his temples, Lin Shan realized that now that he had reached Foundation Establishment and still had 104 points of Ancient Charm left, it was time to upgrade his other aspects.

First and foremost—his cultivation technique.

The "Xun Wind Technique" he currently used only covered the Qi Refining stage. For further progress into Foundation Establishment, he needed to enhance it.

---

After browsing the market, he learned about the availability of techniques. Unlike the abundant variety of five-element techniques, wind-attribute techniques were exceedingly rare—only two or three for Qi Refining, and none for Foundation Establishment.

After all, cultivation techniques were monopolized resources.

As long as major sects and clans monopolized high-level techniques, rogue cultivators would struggle to advance, indirectly reinforcing the dominance of cultivation world elites.

While five-element techniques were common enough, exotic techniques were nearly impossible to find. In fact, they were rarer than niche paths like the Demonic, Blood, Ghost, Sword, or Confucian techniques.

After all, those with wind, thunder, or ice spiritual roots were already rare outliers. Meanwhile, techniques like the Demonic or Blood Paths could be cultivated regardless of one's attributes, offering rapid progress and formidable early-stage power.

As for Buddhist techniques—those didn't even need seeking. They were everywhere, as Buddhism eagerly wanted the entire cultivation world to convert. Yet few actually practiced them.

The prohibition against sensual pleasures was a dealbreaker for most. Not everyone had hopes for immortality—when progress stalled, indulgence in pleasures became inevitable.

While young, one might cultivate fiercely, but who knew if they'd seek a Dao companion for dual cultivation later? Practicing Buddhism would mean cutting off their lineage. Attempting to leave the path later might even require restarting cultivation due to inner demons—far more trouble than it was worth.

Lin Shan examined the available wind-attribute Qi Refining technique fragments and found three:

"Gale Technique,"  
"Netherwind Art,"  
"Wind Thunder Technique."

Suddenly, his "Xun Wind Technique" seemed lackluster!

The "Gale Technique" obviously enhanced spiritual energy potency.  
The "Netherwind Art" clearly imbued spiritual energy with a chilling, freezing attribute.  
The "Wind Thunder Technique" didn't even need explanation—combining wind and thunder for both power and speed, a dual-attribute technique.

His "Xun Wind Technique," having been enhanced from a mortal martial art, was clearly skewed toward speed—basically designed for fleeing.

Moreover, back in the Great Song imperial palace, Lin Fan had tested his spiritual roots and confirmed he possessed thunder affinity. Though his talent was mediocre, the "Wind Thunder Technique" seemed tailor-made for him.

As for it only having Qi Refining fragments with Foundation Establishment portions lost to time...

Was that even a problem for him?
