# Chapter 109: I Want You to Pay for This Blood Debt, I'm Sorry to Have Disturbed You

Everyone moved incredibly fast, traversing the vast green waves and endless ocean, quickly arriving on a large island.

"The largest sect in the Sunset Sea Region is called Spirit Tide Sect. The Wind Spirit Island ahead is the second largest island within Spirit Tide Sect's territory, comparable to a continent. It's filled with shops and numerous restaurants, the most famous of which is 'Immortal's Welcome'. It has plenty of fine wine, beautiful women, and spirit food. We'll go to that restaurant," Grandfather Hong said with a smile.

"Old Hong, it seems you haven't wasted your time as a rogue cultivator; you really know how to enjoy life. Even I, who live in the ocean, am not as familiar with this place as you. In these past few millennia, you must have visited many places, right?" Haiming chuckled, teasing him.

Everyone had unexpectedly fallen into the Death Mist and had spent at least a millennium in Grand Venerable Muyuan's ruined world, becoming familiar with each other. Now, their conversations were quite cheerful and relaxed.

"When life is at its best, one must enjoy it to the fullest. In the vast world, it's natural to travel around, see things, and experience the beauty of the world; it's even more beneficial for comprehending the Dao," Grandfather Hong laughed.

"Indeed, indeed. Old Hong, you live so freely and unconstrained; it's truly admirable," Feng Ran of Myriad Sword Sect chuckled.

"I envy you all instead. Each of you holds high positions and power within your sects, admired by others, unlike me who lives exposed to the elements, enduring all sorts of mundane hardships." Grandfather Hong shook his head, smiling, then suddenly pointed ahead, "That's Wind Spirit Island up front."

Everyone passed through clouds and mist, and a massive island slowly emerged into view. Grandfather Hong led the way, flying directly towards a tall restaurant in the central region. Seven streaks of light descended abruptly. Looking up, the restaurant's signboard indeed read "Immortal's Welcome".

"'Immortal's Welcome,' this is a major power; their business spans across countless worlds," Grand Venerable Muyuan said calmly, looking at the plaque.

"Oh?" Hearing Grand Venerable Muyuan speak like this, everyone couldn't help but ask curiously, "How does this Immortal's Welcome compare to the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance?"

"They're comparable. One specializes in opening restaurants and managing food and drink, while the other specializes in selling magical treasures and pills. Both are extremely powerful. As long as you have money, Immortal's Welcome can even procure dragon liver and phoenix gall for you. The dragon liver here is from a Five-Clawed Golden Dragon, not some flood dragon or viper," Grand Venerable Muyuan explained.

"Five-Clawed Golden Dragon liver?" Everyone was startled and asked, "The Dragon Race is extremely protective of its own, and the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon is a core branch within the Dragon Race. Immortal's Welcome dares to eat the liver of a Five-Clawed Golden Dragon? Aren't they afraid of incurring the Dragon Race's wrath?"

"There's nothing to be surprised about. Once your cultivation reaches the Mahayana realm, allowing you to break through world barriers and freely travel between realms, you'll discover that the vast world holds countless wonders. Simply eating a dragon liver is nothing to speak of," Grand Venerable Muyuan said calmly.

A truly great figure speaks with such understatement, yet everything they say reveals immense power.

"Haha, let's go inside. Although this small place doesn't have dragon liver, I'll do my best to arrange with the manager here to serve us the finest spiritual ingredients and wine," Grandfather Hong chuckled.

Everyone nodded and walked in.

Inside Immortal's Welcome, the atmosphere was grand and magnificent, as luxurious as an imperial palace. Layer upon layer, arrays were set up everywhere, with spiritual light subtly shimmering. Unlike common city restaurants, it wasn't bustling with people or noisy; instead, it was exceptionally quiet, clearly an elegant establishment.

As soon as they entered, a beautiful young girl approached them, smiling sweetly, "Do the esteemed guests have a reservation?"

"No," Grandfather Hong replied calmly.

"Esteemed guests, I apologize, but reservations are required here. Would you like to book a date first?" The girl smiled slightly, took out a calendar-type magic treasure, and slowly offered it to Grandfather Hong.

"Drinking requires a reservation?" Feng Ran raised an eyebrow, sweeping his divine sense around. "Aren't there so many empty rooms here? When guests arrive, is it reasonable to turn them away?"

"Qingyuan, step back. Let me attend to these esteemed guests." At this moment, a voice sounded, and a woman in a long white dress, with an extraordinary aura, slowly walked over. Her cultivation was at the late Stage of Soul Transformation.

"Junior Qingling, I am the assistant manager of Immortal's Welcome. Seniors, you seem unfamiliar; I presume this is your first visit?" The woman smiled, secretly observing everyone, and was inwardly astonished to find that she could only discern the cultivation of one person present; the others were all unfathomable, like a deep ocean abyss, impossible to gauge. She was greatly surprised, clearly, the strength of these individuals was above the Soul Transformation Stage.

"I came here a thousand years ago," Grandfather Hong said calmly at this moment.

A strange glint flashed in Qingling's eyes, and she warmly smiled, "Seniors, please proceed to the Thirty-Third Heaven, Room 'A'."

"Thirty-Third Heaven?" Yang Ji looked up, curiously observing as Qingling led the way, flying up to the very top floor.

"The Profound Heaven Pagoda is in the hands of the Immortal's Welcome faction. The restaurant's 'Thirty-Third Heaven' should be symbolic of that," Grand Venerable Muyuan said.

"Profound Heaven Pagoda? What level of treasure is that?" Yang Ji asked.

"The Profound Heaven Pagoda was once the realm- trấn treasure of the Profound Heaven Cultivation World. The one Immortal's Welcome possesses is the only replica among the myriad worlds, and it's a powerful immortal artifact," Grand Venerable Muyuan said.

"Senior has excellent knowledge," Qingling said, glancing at Grand Venerable Muyuan twice. She then pushed open the door to Room 'A' and said, "Seniors, please take a seat inside. The menu on the table is a magic treasure. Whatever you wish to eat, simply tap on its name on the menu, and the kitchen downstairs will prepare it accordingly."

"Alright, you can go attend to your duties," Grandfather Hong said calmly.

"If any seniors have needs, please just say so. Qingling will take her leave now," Qingling smiled slightly and exited the room.

Yang Ji glanced at the menu, and his purse involuntarily tightened. Nine-Yin Dragon Earthworm, Seven-Colored Flower Pig, Whitewood Saint Fruit, Millennium Monkey Wine, Five-Colored Spirit Lotus Bear King's Paw. Each of these items was incredibly valuable. Yang Ji's current stock of pills and spirit stones wasn't enough to buy even a few of them. With these spiritual ingredients, after further processing, wouldn't their value at least double? Immortal's Welcome truly knows how to make money, Yang Ji couldn't help but sigh in admiration. Today, he could only freeload off a high-class meal.

Outside Wind Spirit Island, one person in a yellow robe and two in black robes were hurrying towards the island. If Yang Ji were here, he would surely recognize that the person in yellow robes was precisely Emperor Liu. At this moment, he seemed to have forgotten the pain of losing his son, his face wreathed in smiles as he said, "Since the two Devil Envoys have arrived, I will surely host a welcoming banquet for you. I've reserved a room at Immortal's Welcome, and today, I vow to drink to our heart's content with both of you."

"Fort Lord Liu is too kind," the voices of the two black-robed figures were exceptionally deep and chilling.

"In the future, I hope the two Devil Envoys will speak favorably of me before the Devil Venerable," Emperor Liu said with a fawning smile.

"Easy to say, easy to say," the two black-robed figures replied in their low tones, seemingly devoid of emotion.

Just as the three approached the island, a figure suddenly flew from ahead, landing in front of Emperor Liu, and said in a panic, "Fort Lord, I think I just saw *that person* at Immortal's Welcome."

"Which person?" Emperor Liu asked in a deep voice.

"The one who killed the Young Master."

"What?" Emperor Liu flew into a rage, and a monstrous killing intent surged tens of thousands of feet high. "Damned by heaven, you actually didn't die in the Death Mist. In that case, I will personally end your life."

On Wind Spirit Island, at Immortal's Welcome, a group of four arrived with murderous intent, charging directly towards the Thirty-Third Heaven. Even Qingling couldn't stop them.

"You little brat, I want you to pay this blood debt!" The voice, like angry thunder, rumbled through the thirty-three floors of Immortal's Welcome, shaking all the arrays until spiritual light burst forth. Everyone inside the building felt a clap of thunder ring in their ears, their eardrums buzzing. Instantly, the entire building fell into dead silence, quiet enough to hear a pin drop.

Then came a "bang," and the door to Room 'A' on the Thirty-Third Heaven was kicked open, splinters flying.

"You little brat, I want you to..." Emperor Liu, full of murderous intent, appeared in a rage. But in the blink of an eye, the murderous intent on his face froze.

Because he discovered that there were five people in the room, all simmering with indignation, glaring coldly. Just one look sent a shiver down his spine.

Such aura... Integration Stage Grand Experts? Five Integration Stage Grand Experts? How is that possible?

The arrogant Emperor Liu instantly felt a chill down his spine, his soul trembling wildly. The next moment, he actually squeezed out an incredibly awkward smile, bowing and scraping as he said, "Seniors, I'm sorry, I... I entered the wrong room. My apologies for disturbing you."
