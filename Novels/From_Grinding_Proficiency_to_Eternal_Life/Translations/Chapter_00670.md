# Chapter 670: Cultivators as Great Rats

Xu Yunfan furrowed his brow slightly. This was undoubtedly snatching food from a tiger's mouth, or even carving flesh from the foundations of other True Lords.

The cycle system that fit his Divine Thunder Dao Fruit best was to form a foundational framework of the Five Elements flowing and Yin-Yang balancing.

After all, his Divine Thunder Dao Fruit governed destruction and growth, which could be called Yin and Yang.

His thoughts raced, combining his own sensory connection to the Heavenly Dao rules with the records of the sect, and his goal gradually became clear.

"The Taihua Lingxu Realm also has Dao Fruits belonging to the Great Yin aspect. From the current perspective, one of the Dao Fruits in the Samsara Undersea seems to be the most representative. But the Blazing Yang Dao Fruit..."

Thinking of the Li Guang Ranyan Blazing True Lord who resided in the Wansheng Sword Sect, whose single strand of sword intent could burn the sky and boil the sea, and whose temper was said to be as violent as his Dao Fruit, Xu Yunfan felt a headache coming on.

The Dao Fruit the other party had comprehended was the most compatible with his Divine Thunder Dao Fruit.

This was almost equivalent to declaring war on one of the Wansheng Sword Sect's top combatants.

But the other party should absolutely be fixated on him right now too. After all, his Divine Thunder Dao Fruit was also extremely compatible with the other party's Li Guang Ranyan Blazing Yang Dao Fruit.

This Dao Fruit had similar attributes to the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit. If they could fuse, Yang Fire would birth Yang Thunder, or Yang Thunder would stimulate Yang Fire; the power would definitely skyrocket.

But this also meant that he and that Blazing True Lord were born mortal enemies in the Dao struggle, irreconcilable.

The other party's divine abilities and cultivation methods would inevitably have an instinctual craving for Xu Yunfan's Divine Thunder Dao Fruit, like the two poles of a magnet attracting and repelling each other.

His foundation was not yet stable. If he rashly confronted a veteran True Lord, his chances of victory were slim.

As for the Great Yin Dark Serpent Dao Fruit hanging high in the Samsara Bitter Sea.

This Dao Fruit was extremely Yin and cold, governing reflection and stillness, forming a stark Yin-Yang opposition to the violent destruction of the Divine Thunder.

If he could use the soft, Yin power of the Great Yin Dark Serpent Dao Fruit to harmonize the extreme Yang and extreme hardness of the Divine Thunder, and then use the pure Yang fire of the Blazing True Lord's Dao Fruit to mediate or catalyze in the middle, he could initially form a triangular cycle of Great Yin, Divine Thunder, and Blazing Yang.

Great Yin births Divine Thunder, Divine Thunder assists Blazing Yang, and Blazing Yang might be able to reciprocate and balance Great Yin.

But the Samsara Bitter Sea was not easy to enter.

No wonder, no wonder cultivators are condemned by the Heavenly Dao as great rats. If cultivators want to move up, they naturally have to cut flesh from the Heavenly Dao.

Just as he was frowning in thought, Xu Yunfan suddenly slapped his forehead.

"I almost forgot a big matter!"

After achieving the Golden Core, there had been many trivial matters: consolidating his realm, dealing with Dongming True Lord to digest his gains, and thinking about his future path. He had actually forgotten to pay his respects to the true current ruler of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Pudu True Lord.

The leader of the Primordial Origin Sect. He had risen to Golden Core and hadn't gone.

This was truly rude and might even cause displeasure.

He still needed to mix within the Primordial Origin Sect; it was not yet time to establish his own门户.

He immediately retracted his mind, straightened the purple-gold thunder-patterned Dao Robe that represented his identity as a True Lord, and transformed into a streak of purple-gold lightning that tore through the sky, shooting straight towards Chenghua Mountain among the Nine Immortal Mountains of the Primordial Origin.

That was Pudu True Lord's Dao Field.

As soon as he entered the territory of Chenghua Mountain, a vast yet immensely dignified grand image enveloped him.

Completely different from the violent thunder of Divine Thunder Peak or the nine abysses' gloominess of Xuansha Mountain, this place was wreathed in immortal light, with spiritual birds and auspicious beasts faintly visible. The sound of Buddhist chants and Zen singing drifted faintly among the mountains, the earth was lush with vegetation, full of vitality, and there was a grand vow power flowing that dissolved戾气 (violence/戾气) and delivered all living beings.

It had a bit of the meaning of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land. Xu Yunfan sensed this and couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.

The entire mountain seemed to be shrouded in a layer of warm and soft immortal light, making the space appear exceptionally stable and peaceful.

This was the Dao Image of Pudu True Lord.

"Deliver all living beings, cleanse the world with Vairochana."

Within his Dao Field, all violence and curses would be greatly suppressed and dispelled, and hostility would be difficult to breed.

This was truly strange.

Xu Yunfan was full of wonder. He hadn't expected that a true Buddha could emerge from the Primordial Origin Sect?

He naturally didn't believe it. A True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect achieving such an image—his roots and philosophy were definitely crooked.

Xu Yunfan's thunder light遁光 (light travel) actively dissipated as he approached the mountain peak to show respect.

He set foot on the ground and walked up.

The disciples and deacons he met along the way, regardless of their cultivation level, upon seeing him wearing the True Lord robe, all bowed and saluted, saying "Greetings, Divine Thunder True Lord," their eyes filled with awe.

A True Lord could decide their life and death with a single thought.

Xu Yunfan's expression was calm. He nodded in acknowledgment and took a step, traversing several miles, quickly arriving before the majestic Pudu弘法 (Propagation of the Dharma) Hall at the summit, which had a glazed roof and was wreathed in sandalwood incense.

The hall doors opened silently.

A yellow-robed Taoist with compassionate features and an aura as deep and stable as the sea stood by the side of the door, bowing in salute.

"The True Lord has been waiting quietly. Please follow me, Divine Thunder True Lord."

Although this person's aura was obscure, Xu Yunfan could sense that his cultivation was probably above that of Modu, having already taken half a step into the Golden Core threshold.

His cultivation was similar to that of Chu Chengnan and Lu Chuan.

Not daring to prove the Golden Core, after all, could not sit at the table.

Entering the hall, he saw that the space was far more magnificent than its exterior suggested.

The hall's ceiling was like a starry dome, adorned with countless immortal lights.

In the center, on a meditation cushion, sat Pudu True Lord.

He had a simple and ancient appearance, a slightly thin figure, wore a simple and plain moon-white Dao robe, and had a Dao crown on his head. His face was peaceful, and there was not the slightest fluctuation of magical power leaking from his body, as if he had merged with the entire Chenghua Mountain, or even with the surrounding heaven and earth.

Only those deep eyes, like an endless starry sea, opening and closing, revealed a divine light that understood worldly affairs and pitied all living beings, making Xu Yunfan feel a tremendous pressure originating from the level of life.

This True Lord's Dao attainment was definitely far superior to that of Qingyuan and Dongming, and had probably reached the mid Golden Core stage or even higher.

Especially this kind of peaceful aura made him feel an extreme sense of incongruity, as if he had stepped out of the scene.

He felt as if he were in the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land.

"Disciple Xu Yunfan greets Pudu True Lord. Having returned after proving the Dao, I was entangled in trivial matters and failed to pay my respects to the Sect Master in time. Please forgive me, True Lord."

Xu Yunfan retracted all his aura and bowed in a solemn Dao salute. Now that they were both Golden Core, although there was a difference in strength, there was no need to be overly humble.

Pudu True Lord's gaze fell upon Xu Yunfan, warm and peaceful.

"Divine Thunder True Lord, no need for excessive courtesy. Achieving the Golden Core is the fortune of our Primordial Origin Sect, and moreover, a manifestation of your own great perseverance, great wisdom, and great fortune."

Pudu True Lord's voice was peaceful and slow, carrying a strange power to soothe the heart.

"Qingyuan's matter was his own fault. Blocking another's path and scheming against a fellow Daoist's foundation is the behavior of a demon. You eliminated this disaster for the sect, a great merit. All matters of the past are like clouds and smoke; there is no need to dwell on them."

"Disciple understands. Thank you, True Lord, for your understanding."

Xu Yunfan replied respectfully, but his heart chilled.
