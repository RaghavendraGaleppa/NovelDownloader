# Chapter 54: First Meeting, Already Owning Over Twenty Thousand Taels  

"Let's settle the accounts."  

Upon hearing the Taoist priest's words, Lin Musheng's face showed surprise—he didn't understand the meaning behind them.  

Xiao Ji didn’t give him much time to react.  

"Heating fee: five copper coins. Don’t complain about the price. Last winter was unusually harsh, with heavy snowfall that lingered into spring, blocking the mountain passes. Firewood prices rose—it's just market forces at work."  

"Then there’s the basin you vomited poison into. It’s unusable now. That basin was at least eighty percent new. Given the unstable times and rising prices, what used to cost five copper coins now costs at least twenty for the same quality. And this was a custom piece from the Niu Family Blacksmith Shop."  

"Tea fee: six coins... Helping you escape the root of your pursuers? That’s worth at least ten thousand taels."  

"Also, the people hunting you will eventually reach Willow Town—they’re likely the last ones who know your whereabouts. If you need help dealing with them, how much do you think that’s worth?"  

By the end of the calculations, Lin Musheng owed Xiao Ji over twenty-one thousand taels of silver, plus two hundred-some copper coins.  

Lin Musheng stayed silent, unsure of what to say.  

He had only come in to take temporary shelter and stabilize his life force with spiritual energy.  

After a long pause, he finally muttered, "I left home in a hurry. I don’t have that much on me."  

"You can pay with other things," Xiao Ji reminded him.  

"Taoist Master, I can tell you’re no ordinary man—you don’t strike me as a materialistic cultivator obsessed with money. Actually..." Lin Musheng wanted to argue, unwilling to suddenly shoulder such a massive debt.  

"Between men and women, emotions can be discussed. Between men, money is simpler," Xiao Ji cut him off. "I know you’re reluctant, so I’ll make a concession: a ten percent discount. I’ll also let you recover at the Original Divinity Temple, provide you with a clean room, and cover all meals—three servings a day, unlimited portions."  

"Additionally, I’ll help you with one more thing for free. If your pursuers do arrive in Willow Town, I’ll handle them. While you heal, your safety is my responsibility."  

If not for the money, what a wonderful Taoist priest he would be.  

Lin Musheng felt conflicted. He reached for the cup of hot tea in front of him but suddenly froze, thinking, *Is this tea charged per cup? If I drink less, maybe I’ll owe less.*  

Fate had already decided things—he had no strength left to resist. Summoning his courage, he met Xiao Ji’s gaze. "Taoist Master, even if I had a hundred thousand taels, I’d hand them over without hesitation."  

*But you don’t have it now...* Xiao Ji remained silent.  

"It’s just that Lin Family Fort is currently controlled by my third uncle. If I ever reclaim my family’s legacy, I’ll repay you tenfold. But right now, I truly don’t have that much." Lin Musheng’s voice grew quieter.  

Xiao Ji suddenly had an idea.  

"What’s your third uncle’s cultivation level?" he asked.  

"Late-stage Qi Refining swordsman, Great Perfection, preparing for Foundation Establishment. He’s strong... That’s why he didn’t come after me himself—he’s busy breaking through."  

"I can help you defeat him. In three years," Xiao Ji said. "If that’s possible, what would you be willing to pay?"  

"Any price. Even my life." Lin Musheng’s tone was resolute, his eyes practically glowing as he looked at the priest.  

He was now certain Xiao Ji was a hidden master. No ordinary Taoist could have easily detected his poisoning, healed him, or noticed the tracking mark on his scabbard...  

There were no coincidences in this world—only the priest’s own formidable strength.  

Xiao Ji studied Lin Musheng for a long moment, analyzing the swordsman deeply. Though his spiritual roots were only of the third grade, Foundation Establishment wasn’t impossible. With proper guidance and no interference, he could break through in just over two years.  

And Xiao Ji happened to excel at identifying others’ weaknesses, including cultivation flaws—just as he had advised Song Yuanbao. All he needed to do was point out the key areas and the right path.  

If Lin Musheng stayed hidden in the Original Divinity Temple for two or three years, reaching Foundation Establishment was guaranteed.  

From his description, his third uncle had only recently touched the Great Perfection stage of Qi Refining. He, too, had third-grade spiritual roots and wasn’t progressing quickly.  

Based on the usual timeline for Foundation Establishment, it would take at least three to five years of preparation.  

If Xiao Ji helped Lin Musheng reach Foundation Establishment by the time his uncle succeeded, wouldn’t reclaiming Lin Family Fort be trivial?  

"Good. Then right now," Xiao Ji said, "hand over everything valuable—and worthless—on you. Prove it to me."  

Lin Musheng hesitated.  

Then he recalled his mother’s final words: *"...Those with shallow fortunes cannot control it. I don’t know if giving this to you is right or wrong... Take it, and leave it to fate."*  

Wasn’t meeting Priest Xiao fate itself?  

Moreover, the man had saved his life. Just destroying the tracking gem alone was already an immeasurable debt. What more was there to hesitate over?  

Some things were never meant to belong to the Lin Family.  

"Alright." Lin Musheng placed all his belongings before Xiao Ji, ending with an ancient pipa head carved with coiling dragons. "Taoist Master Xiao, may I ask... what’s your current cultivation level?"  

A priest like him—surely a Nascent Soul old monster?  

"I’m close to Foundation Establishment," Xiao Ji said honestly. "Theoretically, I’m no weaker than your third uncle."  

*Not a Nascent Soul expert after all...*  

Though his level wasn’t low, for some reason, disappointment crept in.  

The greater the hope, the greater the fall.  

Now the question was: after training under a Qi Refining Great Perfection priest for two or three years, could he really defeat his third uncle?  

Lin Musheng looked dejected.  

But the path was already set—there was no turning back.  

*"As Mother said, leave it to fate."*  

---  

Lin Musheng settled into the Original Divinity Temple.  

Xiao Ji led him to the backyard, assigned him an empty room, and briefed him on the temple’s current state, introducing its other two occupants.  

"This quilt hasn’t been washed in years, but it’s still clean." Xiao Ji fetched bedding, dusted it off, and handed it to the newcomer.  

Just as Lin Musheng was about to thank him, he hesitated.  

Taoist Master Xiao was meticulous about accounts. In less than an hour, he’d already taken everything Lin Musheng owned and saddled him with a twenty-thousand-tael debt. Would this quilt also come with a price?  

"Never mind the quilt. A swordsman doesn’t need bedding." Lin Musheng avoided Xiao Ji’s eyes.  

"Suit yourself. I’ll leave it here—use it if you want," Xiao Ji said. "For washing your face—"  

"I won’t wash my face either," Lin Musheng cut in quickly. "If I must, I’ll just use my hands."  

"I meant, you can use the basin you vomited in earlier. You’ve already paid for that one." Xiao Ji shook his head slightly.  

Lin Musheng: "Oh. That works."  

"I’ll find you a new set of clothes later, but the temple only has Taoist robes..." Xiao Ji wanted to make him comfortable, especially after taking his treasures.  

"No need for new clothes. One set is enough. With my vengeance unresolved, I’ve no mind for such things." Lin Musheng sounded almost apologetic.  

"They’re free. Take them or don’t." Xiao Ji sighed.
