# Chapter 317: Lin

The old man’s sword energy was like a withered branch, lacking any of the terrifying power expected of a Grandmaster of Organ Refining.

Xu Yunfan felt a flicker of doubt and couldn't help but provoke him with a grin. "Old man, is this Seven Killing Sword of yours all there is to it?"

Before his words had fully faded, the mountain patterns on the撼岳镇海锤 (Shattering Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer) suddenly blazed with crimson light. Wherever the hammer wind swept, the third-floor carved screen exploded into dust.

"Die!"

Jiang Tianyang’s hair and beard bristled, his withered body erupting with a terrifying aura.

A blood-colored sword qi shot from the sword tip, plowing seven deep trenches into the entire floor. A hoarse roar squeezed from his throat. Before the sword energy even arrived, the tiles of the teahouse thirty zhang away had already begun to crackle and shatter.

*Clang!*

The deafening collision of sword and hammer shattered every remaining intact window frame of the Changfeng Tavern.

Xu Yunfan’s arm muscles coiled like dragons. Under his skin, the golden patterns of the "Mysterious Steel Hundred Tempering Art" merged with his Pure Yang True Energy. Driven by the massive energy flow brought about by the perfection of the Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Washing Technique, every hammer strike carried the force of a collapsing mountain.

Jiang Tianyang’s long sword danced, the Seven Killing sword energy transforming into a blood-colored python that entangled the hammer body. The floor beneath their feet collapsed with a roar, and the entire tavern trembled violently.

At the one hundred and fiftieth move, Xu Yunfan executed a sweeping strike with the "Five Mountains Collapse" hammer technique. Jiang Tianyang dodged to the side, but the residual shockwave of the hammer wind snapped the western load-bearing pillar in half.

The three-story pavilion groaned under the unbearable strain. The beast head at the eaves corner cracked and fell toward the street, causing the surrounding cultivators to retreat in panic.

*Rumble!*

At the two hundredth move, Jiang Tianyang thrust his sword toward Xu Yunfan’s throat, only to be repelled by the hammer's surface. The violent qi exploded in a ring shape, and the eastern wall of the Changfeng Tavern completely collapsed. Flying bricks and stones shot through the gilded signboard of the pawnshop across the street.

Within a thirty-zhang radius, the exterior walls of buildings were covered in spiderweb cracks. The bronze alchemy furnace in front of the medicine shop was sliced in half by a stray streak of sword energy.

At the two hundred and ninety-ninth move, Xu Yunfan suddenly changed his technique.

His right foot shattered the floor, sinking to his knee. His left hammer swept upward from below in the "Thousand Jun" stance. The hammer wind, carrying the Pure Yang True Energy, caused Jiang Tianyang’s protective sword aura to sizzle and burn.

The old monster retreated three steps in a panic, his back crashing into and collapsing the final standing pillar.

*Crack!*

The entire Changfeng Tavern collapsed with a thunderous roar! Dust shot into the sky, and broken wood and beams rained down like a storm.

Xu Yunfan stepped on the falling floorboards and charged forward, crossing his hammers in an 'X' to smash toward Jiang Tianyang’s crown. The old monster hastily raised his arms to block, and the sound of bone cracking immediately echoed. He was sent flying like a ragged sack, plowing a ten-zhang-long trench in the bluestone street before finally stopping his momentum.

When the dust settled, it was visible that within a thirty-zhang radius centered on the ruins, all buildings had been reduced to broken walls and collapsed structures. The teahouse was left with only half a charred door frame, and the century-old vinegar jar in the wine shop had exploded, filling the air with a pungent, acidic mist.

Three hundred moves passed in the blink of an eye.

At this moment, Jiang Tianyang’s hair and beard stood on end. His halted figure seemed to merge into a beam of light as the seventh sword, "Greedy Wolf," carrying the accumulated killing intent, hacked down violently.

Xu Yunfan suddenly spun his body. His left hammer划出 a half-circle to neutralize the force, while his right hammer thrust out from under his ribs. The gilded mouth of the hammer head met the sword edge with pinpoint accuracy. The power of the earth's veins on the Shattering Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer surged and exploded instantly.

*Clang!!*

Amidst the deafening sound, Jiang Tianyang’s grip shattered, and fine cracks appeared on the Broken Jade Sword.

In the brief pause for breath, Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged. His muscles bulged, and his figure was now a size larger than before. He raised the heavy hammer, the head pointing directly at Jiang Tianyang.

"It's not too late to back down now."

At this moment, under the influence of the Seven Killing Sword's killing intent, Jiang Tianyang’s eyes were already bloodshot. He couldn't hear Xu Yunfan’s words at all and simply charged forward with his sword.

Xu Yunfan sighed. If Jiang Tianyang could calm down, there was still a chance to resolve this. After all, being used as a pawn in a scheme naturally made him unhappy.

He then said calmly, "Three hammer strikes to finish you."

"First Hammer!"

Xu Yunfan let out a long cry.

His spine undulated like a great dragon. Pure Yang True Energy exploded from his Dantian into his four limbs and hundred bones. The crimson-gold flow patterns appearing under his skin faintly formed the shape of dragon scales.

The Shattering Mountain Hammer, carrying the power of the mountain's soul, smashed down violently. Jiang Tianyang hastily retreated three steps, blocking horizontally with his sword edge, but was shaken by the hammer force, causing his chest bones to cave in.

The intact window frames on the western street shattered with a *crash*, and broken wood mixed with sword energy residue sprayed out ten zhang.

While gasping for breath, Jiang Tianyang suddenly bit the tip of his tongue, spraying a mist of blood onto the sword body. A诡异青光 (strange green light) seeped from the cracks, and the Sword Pavilion's forbidden technique, "Weapon Dissolution," was unleashed!

His hunched body swelled like a balloon, and aged skin bulged with earthworm-like blue veins. The Broken Jade Sword transformed into a streak of blood-colored lightning, stabbing straight for Xu Yunfan’s throat.

"Second Hammer!"

Xu Yunfan dragged his feet backward, leaving burning scorch marks on the floorboards with every step.

His right hammer swept diagonally. The instant the mountain patterns on the hammer surface touched the blood sword, his left arm suddenly expanded by three circles. The sound of metal and stone rubbing came from beneath his skin. It was the sign of the "Mysterious Steel Hundred Tempering Art" combined with the Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Washing Technique, pushed to their absolute limit.

*Crack!*

The Broken Jade Sword shattered with a sound. Sword fragments sprayed out like a torrent of rain.

A shard grazed Xu Yunfan’s cheek but was弹开 (bounced off) the moment it touched his skin, leaving only a string of sparks.

Jiang Tianyang stumbled backward, bleeding from all seven orifices, the Seven Killing sword energy behind him having mostly dissipated.

"You dare to clash head-on with a Divine Weapon just because you're holding a Treasure Tool?"

Xu Yunfan sneered, crossing his hammers in a cross in front of his chest. His pores all over his body喷出 (sprayed out) a pure white qi. The Pure Yang True Energy blended with the mountain soul power of the Shattering Mountain Hammer,凝成 (condensed) into a three-zhang-tall phantom of a giant hammer above his head.

"Third Hammer!"

The hammer fell like a meteor crashing to the earth.

Jiang Tianyang barely raised his arms to block, but his arm bones issued a grating sound of shattering.

He was smashed into the floorboards. Spiderweb-like cracks spread from him to cover the entire ground. A load-bearing column at the southeast corner finally could not hold out any longer, collapsing with half of the floorboards. In the dust, a street full of birds was startled into flight.

When the dust cleared, Jiang Tianyang was slumped in a pit more than a zhang deep, his right arm twisted into a诡异 (grotesque) angle. Xu Yunfan stepped on the last trace of protective sword energy on his chest, the hammer tip resting on his chest, seeming to weigh ten thousand jun.

Many surrounding buildings were tilted and on the verge of falling. Remaining window frames creaked and swayed in the wind,木屑 (wood shavings) falling like snow.

"Sword Pavilion Elder?" Xu Yunfan scoffed, the mountain patterns on the hammer surface gradually fading. "Hardly impressive."

Having said this, Xu Yunfan didn't pause at all. He glanced at the Dao Sect disciples who were watching with their jaws dropped.

"You留下来 (stay behind) to handle the compensation matters."

Chen Hong trembled with his lips and nodded heavily. "Yes, Senior Brother Xu!"

Xu Yunfan stomped his foot arch, and the bluestone street collapsed three inches with a roar. His figure was like a great eagle soaring through the air, landing in one step on the flying eaves of the tallest building on Vermilion Bird Avenue. The gilded eave beast was crushed to powder by this landing.

He looked around, fell silent for a moment, and immediately插回 (sheathed) the heavy hammer into his waist clip.

His hands结出 (formed) the Lin Seal in front of his chest.

"Lin."

The moment his hands formed the seal, driven by the Lin Character Art, the surging killing intent, doubts, and contempt within his Sea of Consciousness, as if meeting a natural enemy, were instantly suppressed to freezing point.

A "Self-God" identical to Xu Yunfan’s appearance walked out from the Purple Mansion and sat on the lotus platform in the center of the Sea of Consciousness. His eyes flowed with the indifferent and cold light of the Supreme Dao, devoid of emotion.

Entering a state almost like flow, everything in his surroundings was印入 (imprinted into) his heart.
