## Chapter 89: The Young Immortal Wields a Great Hammer

Night shrouded the mountains. Golden Rooster Ridge was covered in pristine white snow, and a vibrant crimson fire spring gurgled.

The old man's silver hair was like snow, his face pale and beardless. At first glance, he resembled a scholar, devoid of the bloodthirsty aura of a ruthless bandit. But when he opened his eyes wide in fury, his entire presence transformed. A layer of Heavenly Radiance Force emerged on his body, tinged with a faint bloody hue. This was the blood-qi accumulated from countless killings, so potent that even the Heavenly Radiance Force he had cultivated his entire life couldn't purify it.

Under the night sky, by the fire spring, Qin Ming stood in his green robes, clear and ethereal, looking like a being from beyond the mundane world. From head to toe, he exuded an empty and profound aura.

With a boom, the snow beneath the old man's feet exploded. He transformed into a falcon, covering ten meters with each step as he shot forward, reaching Qin Ming in an instant. At the same time, a dark ruler emerged from his wide sleeve, swinging violently towards the youth, like a streak of black lightning.

Qin Ming's long-handled dark-gold hammer swung with devastating force, making the entire mountaintop tremble slightly as he shattered the sound barrier.

The old man came fast and left even faster. Struck by the heavy hammer on his ruler, he was sent flying horizontally. With a bang, he crashed through a dilapidated wooden hut, sending splinters scattering everywhere. The old man was horrified. He was a Golden Thief, a seasoned killer, and in all his life, he had never encountered such a ferocious youth. This young man, in his fluttering green robes, looked like an exiled immortal, yet he wielded a great hammer that sent an old expert like him flying over ten meters. Was this truly a flesh-and-blood teenager? He suspected he had encountered a mountain spirit.

Qin Ming's eyes were clear, his robes fluttering in the night wind. Illuminated by the fire spring, his handsome face and dark hair seemed to glow, indeed possessing an ethereal quality. He was utterly calm, having anticipated the old man's actions. The old man hadn't detected him inside the ruined wooden hut until he was very close, indicating he hadn't reached a higher cultivation realm.

"A Golden Thief who's undergone seven rebirths is nothing more than this!" Qin Ming walked forward, his steps light, making soft crunching sounds in the snow.

Facing such an extraordinary youth, the old man felt as if he were confronting a giant beast slowly approaching in the darkness. This oppressive feeling suffocated him. He had only come to pay his respects, yet he found himself in a life-or-death crisis. He looked down at his dark ruler, forged from fine gold... it was bent. What immense power! No wonder he had been sent flying.

Suddenly, Qin Ming took the initiative, swinging his great hammer. His steps left no trace on the snow; in the night, he was like a wisp of breeze, arriving in an instant. With a boom, white qi waves erupted around him as the hammer swept through, sending all the accumulated snow flying into the air and shattering the dilapidated houses.

The old man tried to dodge, but found he couldn't match Qin Ming's speed. Gritting his teeth, he braced for the confrontation. With a clang, his black ruler was bent into an arc. Even with the protection of his Heavenly Radiance Force, the web between his right thumb and forefinger tore, blood flowing. This time, he was flung sixteen meters, smashing through an intact wooden house.

By the fire spring, Qin Ming spoke, "You're about the same as Ge Qianxun. Is this the standard for all Golden Thieves? Only about four thousand catties of strength. Your seventh rebirth was also boosted by forbidden drugs, wasn't it?"

The old man's pupils contracted. He had heard earlier that something had happened to Ge Qianxun. Could it be that he had fallen into the hands of this youth? He discarded the now useless ruler, staring at his opponent. The youth seemed to possess the bearing of an exiled immortal, yet he wielded such a massive hammer, creating a sense of temporal dissonance.

Then, the young immortal with the great hammer took a step, covering nearly ten meters in a single bound, arriving before him in an instant. With a boom, the snow in the area exploded, and all the wooden huts collapsed. The old man vomited blood, his clothes ripped apart. The inner armor he wore clanged, and he was left bleeding from all seven orifices, a truly horrific sight. His hands trembled; he had just unleashed the strongest attack of his life, only barely managing to block the great hammer with his palms.

"A little interesting," Qin Ming glanced down at the faint palm print on his dark-gold great hammer. Then, he cast aside the hammer and walked forward. He could have killed this man with the hammer, but he wanted to test his recent studies.

"Do you know how the bandits of Golden Rooster Ridge disappeared?" Qin Ming said, "I personally sent them on their way." This instantly reignited the old man's fighting spirit. The old man, who had just been dispirited, now raged, his eyes crimson, his blood boiling, and his Heavenly Radiance Force surging.

"Ah!" the old man roared like a wounded beast, his voice cold. "My nephew and grandson are buried here. You deserve to die!" With a whoosh, he leaped down the mountain, his spirits soaring. He told himself he had to survive, to seek bloody revenge on this youth later. What they say about old men seeking revenge – thirty years is not too late!

Qin Ming was taken aback. This was completely different from what he had expected. The old man had come here to pay respects, indicating he had feelings, yet at the critical moment, he bolted faster than a rabbit.

Despite the old man's surging blood and powerful Heavenly Radiance Force, he ultimately couldn't escape. After cultivating the Grass-Skimming Flight technique, Qin Ming moved as if riding the wind, catching up to him in an instant.

"I'll fight to the death!" The old man had no choice but to engage in a desperate struggle. His reaction speed seemed to have increased significantly. This was an ability he gained during his sixth rebirth: by burning his essence, qi, and spirit, he could double his perception. In this process, his blood and spirit seemed to burn, consuming his very life force.

Qin Ming lightly touched the old man's palm, activating his Silk-Wrapping Force, causing the old man to instantly fall to the ground. The old man felt humiliated. Bracing himself with his left hand, he twisted his body, his right leg sweeping through the air like an iron whip, aiming for the youth's head. Qin Ming's feet remained still, his right hand shot out. With a hiss, his Nail Force manifested. The old man's leg armor ripped open like paper, and several finger-sized holes appeared on his calf.

"Ah!" The old man screamed, feeling as if nails had pierced his calf, and retreated at extreme speed. He leaped up, stumbling on his feet as his calf gave out. His eyes blazing crimson, he charged forward again.

Qin Ming tested his Hammering Force. With a boom, the old man was sent flying, his left hand a bloody mess, all five fingers broken. "Again!"

The old man realized that the youth was even more terrifying without the hammer. He was using him to test techniques. Each strike was enough to severely wound a seventh-rebirth cultivator. How old was this opponent, and how had he mastered so much Heavenly Radiance Force? In an instant, he experienced an even more terrifying Heavenly Radiance Force—the Explosive Force, which Qin Ming had gained from the Lightning-Fire Refinement Gold Palace. When the old man tried to resist, his entire arm exploded.

Qin Ming felt that using the old man for testing had lost its meaning. He then delivered a final Yellow Mud Palm, a faint yellow mist appearing on his right hand. This sight shocked the old man, who exclaimed, "Yellow Mud Palm! How can you have cultivated that at your age?" The secret manual of Golden Rooster Ridge was originally left behind by the old man himself. He had only cultivated it to minor accomplishment before finding it impossible to advance further, and the book had lost its significance to him. He could imagine that over a month ago, when the youth destroyed Golden Rooster Ridge, he must have obtained that ancient book. The old man found it unbelievable; in such a short time, it was impossible for the opponent to have reached such a level of mastery.

With a bang, he couldn't dodge. In an instant, he was struck by the Yellow Mud Palm. Upon contact with the earthy-yellow mist, his entire body was covered in cracks, and then, with popping sounds, he dissolved into a pile of mangled flesh and shattered bones. Until his last breath, he muttered, "Impossible!" His very understanding was shattered. Wasn't it said that only in the External Saint Stage could one begin to draw upon the essence of the earth?

Qin Ming protected himself with Heavenly Radiance Force, which seeped out slightly, blocking the old man's splattered blood so not a single drop touched him. The night wind blew, his black hair fluttered, and his green robes billowed. Were it not for the great hammer nearby and the pile of blood and flesh beside him, he would truly appear ethereal and otherworldly. From the old man's appearance to his swift demise, the entire process was extremely brief, less than ten breaths.

"Let's go. The matter of Golden Rooster Ridge should be completely settled now." Qin Ming called for Scarlet Eagle. Standing on the raptor's back, he shot into the sky, heading towards Twin Trees Village.

"Oh no, Golden Thieves have appeared in Silver Vine Town!" In the night sky, from a great distance, Qin Ming heard Yu Que's anxious cry. "Ah, Mountain Lord Qin, you've arrived! Four fierce individuals have appeared there. The two sent by Crimson Cloud City couldn't stop them and have fled Silver Vine Town."

Qin Ming's heart sank. More than one or two Golden Thieves were appearing in the Black and White Mountain region; the situation was grim. "Let's go take a look!" He wasn't foolhardily throwing himself into danger, because he knew that the two guarding Silver Vine Town hadn't reached the level of Heavenly Radiance Force externalization. Crimson Cloud City's sphere of influence was vast, and Black and White Mountain was just one area; it was impossible for every town to have an External Saint stationed there. "The fact that those two could escape Silver Vine Town means the four Golden Thieves haven't broken through to higher levels yet," Qin Ming judged.

A fierce wind howled, and night mist surged as Scarlet Eagle carried him over fifty li. Yu Que chirped incessantly, reporting the details. Qin Ming's expression was solemn because Silver Vine Town was only a dozen li from Twin Trees Village; it was truly dangerous.

Soon after, Scarlet Eagle carried him closer. From afar, he saw flames rising from Silver Vine Town. Several houses at the town entrance were already ablaze, accompanied by loud laughter and some crying.

"Golden Thieves, all of you, get over here and die!" Qin Ming roared. Scarlet Eagle descended to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. Qin Ming leaped down and charged into Silver Vine Town.

The four Golden Thieves were covered in blood, dragging two elderly corpses. Clearly, the two not-so-young experts from Crimson Cloud City had been killed by the four great thieves after fleeing outside the town. Their bodies were now being thrown into the burning houses, and the four thieves grinned savagely. Many people in the town were in a panic, women and children crying as they fled deeper into the town.

The four thieves looked up, seeing the youth rapidly charging into the town. They immediately sneered, one of them saying, "Little brat, do you want to die too?" The youngest of the four Golden Thieves was sixty, and the oldest over eighty. One of them, with a grizzled beard, had his opponent's blood splattered on it, looking utterly ferocious.

"Uncle Hong, did you hear the roar from the sky just now? Why does it sound familiar, a bit like Chonghe, not as immature as before?" A young man in splendid clothes, Cui Chongyi, who had been captured by the white owl under the Purple Lightning Beast's subordinate, looked puzzled in the night. He had originally come out to gain experience and meet his "cousin," but hadn't met Qin Ming and eventually chose to travel in the Black and White Mountain region.

"It seems... it is him," Cui Hong, a long-armed middle-aged man, said with a complex expression. They were less than a li from Silver Vine Town. Running at full speed, they quickly approached and saw the youth, illuminated by the firelight, facing the four Golden Thieves alone.

"Chonghe, I'm here to help you!" Cui Chongyi shouted from a distance. Then, he saw Qin Ming explode with power, one hand wielding an exaggeratedly large hammer, the other erupting with Heavenly Radiance Force.

*Puff!*

One Golden Thief was blasted apart by the great hammer!

"Ah..." Another Golden Thief, after clashing palms with Qin Ming, had his arm shatter, then his body was struck by a palm, disintegrating entirely.

"You..." The two older Golden Thieves were terrified. This youth was too horrifying. Although they had been injured earlier, it wasn't to the point of being utterly helpless. Why did his arrival seem to make him burst forth even further? What was this logic?!

The youth's speed in Silver Vine Town increased again. Another Golden Thief was struck by him, collapsing into shattered bones and bloody paste. Then, the youth swung his great hammer, blasting the last one apart.

Afterward, he charged into Silver Vine Town without looking back, and let out a whistle. A Scarlet Eagle swooped down from high in the sky. He leaped onto its back and ascended into the night.

Cui Chongyi, who had just reached the town entrance, shouted, "Cousin, it's me! Don't leave!"

The long-armed middle-aged man, Cui Hong, sighed, "He no longer trusts me. You go after him."

"Chong... Qin Ming, wait for me!" Cui Chongyi yelled, transmitting his voice into the night sky, "Some acquaintances are over here! That damn Li Qingxu has also arrived, seeking a great elixir in this region. You need to be careful in this area!"
