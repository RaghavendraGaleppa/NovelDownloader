# Chapter 25: Silverfish Island  

**Boom!**  

The world turned gray once more, with everything reduced to simple lines. Gu Yuan's vision extended endlessly, as if he could see through all of creation.  

Even the grand formation of Qingfeng Dao Academy couldn't block his sight.  

The mystical properties of the Stone Liquid needed no explanation.  

Gu Yuan dared to use it within the academy precisely because he believed its power transcended the mundane and wouldn't be detected.  

Everything was crystal clear.  

**"Hmm?"**  

Not only that, but Gu Yuan noticed that this time, his vision seemed sharper and reached farther than before. Even the outskirts of the Nine Rivers Great Marsh flickered with faint light.  

*"Could the range of the Stone Liquid's detection be related to my cultivation level?"*  

Gu Yuan pondered.  

This exploration was no different from the previous ones—except for one change: his cultivation had advanced from the fourth to the fifth level of Qi Refinement, granting him spiritual sense.  

*"Well, it's a good thing regardless. I'll figure out the reason after my next breakthrough."*  

Rather than dwelling on it, Gu Yuan focused on searching for opportunities.  

But this time, they were scarce.  

Across the vast expanse of White Egret Island and Qingfeng Mountain, not a single green light spot could be seen—not even the most ordinary white ones.  

Had the world not been reduced to gray lines in his vision, Gu Yuan might have suspected the Stone Liquid had lost its effect.  

*"None at all?"*  

Unwilling to give up, Gu Yuan scanned the academy's surroundings.  

*Was it truly so difficult to 'consume a Golden Core'—to become a disciple of a Golden Core master?*  

Not a single white light spot—not even the slightest opportunity?  

Yet everything remained shrouded in gray mist, devoid of any glimmer.  

*"Am I really going to waste this chance?"*  

Gu Yuan was deeply disappointed.  

Though he had known the odds were slim, he had still held onto a sliver of hope. Yet the outcome remained unsatisfactory.  

A wasted use of the Stone Liquid.  

*"Wait—is that a green light?"*  

Just as Gu Yuan was about to give up, he spotted a faint, flickering green glow on a distant island at the edge of his vision.  

The light was so dim and blurred that he nearly missed it.  

*"Why is it so faint?"*  

Gu Yuan frowned slightly.  

In the past, opportunity light spots had always been vivid and unmistakable. Even the most insignificant white ones shone like beacons in the gray world, while green ones were dazzlingly bright.  

This was the first time Gu Yuan had encountered such a dim glow.  

*"A green light spot should represent a decent opportunity, so why is it like this?"*  

For a moment, Gu Yuan hesitated.  

But then he laughed at his own indecision.  

*"What's there to think about? It's just within the academy's territory—I can simply go and see for myself. Endless deliberation is no match for firsthand investigation!"*  

Having secluded himself for a month, Gu Yuan was already feeling restless. This was the perfect opportunity to explore the academy.  

Without further hesitation, he stowed the Stone Vial, deactivated the formation, and left his cave dwelling.  

Before departing, he extended his spiritual sense to check the message tower outside his cave.  

When a cultivator was in seclusion, their cave formation activated automatically, blocking all visitors and messages—unless summoned by the sect. Any correspondence would remain in the tower.  

*"No golden decree. It seems Lan Tianlu has grown a bit wiser and isn't challenging me to a life-and-death duel anymore."*  

Gu Yuan had half-expected Lan Tianlu, after emerging from the Cold Prison, to petition the Enforcement Hall for another decree to force a duel.  

Had that happened, Gu Yuan wouldn't have minded settling things once and for all.  

But it seemed Lan Tianlu had grown more cautious, realizing that after Gu Yuan refined the spiritual water, their gap in strength had closed.  

*"I wonder if he's broken through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement. If the Lan family hasn't prepared spiritual water for him, perhaps I could still squeeze some benefits out of him."*  

The thought lifted Gu Yuan's spirits. He summoned the sect-issued Cloud-Stepping Shuttle and soared westward.  

---  

Qingfeng Dao Academy was vast.  

Beyond the towering Qingfeng Mountain, which overlooked the land, seven other spiritual peaks pierced the heavens, radiating majestic auras.  

Among them was a peak perpetually draped in snow, where icy winds howled and frozen springs glittered—a breathtaking northern landscape.  

This was one of the seven main peaks of Qingfeng Mountain: Jade Kettle Peak!  

Even from a distance, Gu Yuan couldn't help but marvel at its beauty.  

*"How carefree and joyous it would be to reside here—sipping tea by the snow, with a beauty by one's side."*  

But he only spared it a glance before moving on.  

The opportunity revealed by the Stone Liquid wasn't here—it lay on Silverfish Island, a short distance from Jade Kettle Peak.  

This island, under the jurisdiction of the Alchemy Cauldron Hall, was renowned for its silverfish—a delicacy rich in spiritual energy, highly beneficial to Qi Refinement cultivators.  

Moreover, the island produced "Silverfish Spiritual Water," a high-grade spiritual water for breaking through the spiritual sense barrier. Though considered mediocre among high-grade resources, it was still fiercely contested whenever available.  

According to the Stone Liquid, the opportunity lay at the island's center.  

However, as the island belonged to the Alchemy Cauldron Hall, entry was restricted to its members.  

Thus, before arriving, Gu Yuan had accepted a mission from the "Opportunity Hall."  

With a mission in hand, he could infiltrate the island and investigate the opportunity—much like disguising as a worker to access restricted areas in his past life.  

**"Who dares trespass on Silverfish Island?"**  

As Gu Yuan's shuttle descended toward the island, a burly, rough-faced man—more resembling a butcher than a cultivator—intercepted him.  

Before the man even approached, scorching fire-attribute mana surged forth, threatening to sear Gu Yuan's face.  

*"Such domineering fire techniques—could he be cultivating the Five Elements True Wheel Diagram?"*  

Noticing the eight emerald leaves on the man's sleeve, Gu Yuan was inwardly startled.  

Eighth level of Qi Refinement—just one step away from completing the Five Elements and reaching the ninth level.  

**"Which branch's disciple are you?"**  

The man's gaze burned like flames as he scrutinized Gu Yuan.  

**"Greetings, Senior Brother Steward. I am Gu Yuan of the Hidden Dragon Branch, here under orders from the Opportunity Hall to feed the silverfish."**  

Gu Yuan clasped his hands respectfully.  

The silverfish of the island were notoriously picky—they would only eat the tender tips of "Water Deer Grass."  

Yet Water Deer Grass was a spiritual herb as valuable as the silverfish themselves, if not more so. Using such precious herbs as fish feed would be absurd.  

Fortunately, the Alchemy Cauldron Hall had devised a solution: illusion techniques.  

By altering the fish's senses, ordinary grass could be disguised as Water Deer Grass tips.  

This way, the fish thrived while the herbs were preserved—a perfect arrangement.  

After all, the silverfish were merely picky, not incapable of surviving on regular feed.  

Naturally, the hall's elders were too busy for daily feeding duties.  

Thus, they had bestowed a special seal upon their disciples to cast the illusion—but only those who had refined water-attribute spiritual water could wield it.  

Recently, however, a new requirement had emerged: only those who had refined high-grade spiritual water could use the seal, leaving the island short-handed.  

Gu Yuan had arrived just in time.  

**"Here to feed the fish?"**  

The burly man's fierce expression instantly brightened. Grabbing Gu Yuan's arm, he hurriedly led him to a large lake at the island's center.
