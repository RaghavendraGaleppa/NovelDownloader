# Chapter 21: A New Sunflower  

Twenty days passed in the blink of an eye.  

After collecting today's portion of Solar Essence, Gu Mo focused his mind and entered the Black Mist Space. Inside, a small box glowed with a golden radiance—this was the 50 portions of Solar Essence he had painstakingly accumulated. Without hesitation, Gu Mo carried the box to the vending machine and poured all the Solar Essence into it. As the last portion was deposited, the image of the Sunflower on the machine's interface changed to "available for purchase."  

He clicked "Buy."  

A seed, all too familiar to Gu Mo, rolled out from the machine's opening and landed in his palm. Concentrating on the seed, information about the Sunflower surfaced in his mind, confirming that this was indeed another Sunflower seed. Strangely, the Sunflower's listing on the vending machine remained unchanged, meaning that if Gu Mo gathered another 50 portions of Solar Essence, he could purchase yet another.  

Exiting the Black Mist Space, Gu Mo planted the second Sunflower seed. Just like the first, it sprouted the very next day and, by sunset, provided him with a portion of Solar Essence. However, the second Sunflower only produced twice the usual amount, requiring more time to grow before matching the output of the first.  

Still, whether it was double or triple the usual amount, the vending machine treated it as a single portion—unless Gu Mo intended to use the Solar Essence for cultivation or dispersing the black mist in his space, the difference was negligible.  

Now, Gu Mo only needed to wait another twenty-five days to purchase his third Sunflower. Once he had it, his cultivation speed would match that of someone with a high-grade spiritual root.  

From an inferior spiritual root to a high-grade one—this was truly defying the heavens and altering fate. As such, Gu Mo grew increasingly cautious, ensuring the secret of his Sunflowers remained hidden.  

By the eighth month of joining the Spiritual Plant Hall and the fifth month of tending his spiritual field, Gu Mo had finally gathered another 50 portions of Solar Essence, allowing him to acquire his third Sunflower. In the meantime, he hadn't been idle. Freed from the need to cultivate, he devoted most of his time to caring for his spiritual field and mastering the techniques of a spiritual farmer.  

His efforts bore fruit. The spiritual jade rice in his field now emitted a rich, fragrant aroma, and the number of spiritual farming techniques he had mastered had doubled from two to four. The only technique that still eluded him was the Rejuvenation Art.  

Compared to the other four techniques, the Rejuvenation Art was by far the most difficult. Not only could it heal injured spiritual plants, but it also mended the wounds of cultivators.  

A spiritual farmer who mastered the Rejuvenation Art was in an entirely different league from one who hadn't. Such a farmer could serve as a half-healer, often called upon by the sect to tend to precious spiritual plants. Even when venturing outside the sect, they found it easier to secure a place in expedition teams.  

However, mastering the Rejuvenation Art was no simple feat. Despite applying knowledge from his past life—biology, botany, and medicine—Gu Mo was still a hair's breadth away from grasping it. For an average cultivator, even finding the "door" to understanding the technique would be a challenge, let alone coming close to mastering it.  

Only those with an innate talent for wood-attribute spiritual roots could forcefully comprehend it through sheer aptitude. Spiritual roots weren't just divided by grade—they also had elemental attributes. Every cultivator possessed all five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water), but their distribution varied. Some individuals exhibited a pronounced dominance in one element.  

These were known as elemental spiritual root holders, and they excelled in cultivating techniques aligned with their innate attributes.  

As for outer disciples like Gu Mo, the sect hadn't even bothered testing their spiritual root attributes. There was no point—inferior spiritual roots were almost always evenly distributed and weak across all five elements.  

"First, I should harvest the spiritual jade rice," Gu Mo muttered, setting aside his study of the Rejuvenation Art for now. His original plan had been to master all five spiritual farming techniques before this harvest, achieving what he considered true "immortal-style" farming—no more backbreaking labor with a hoe, which frankly lacked the elegance of cultivation.  

But given his current progress, that plan was no longer feasible.  

Standing before his field, gazing at the golden rice stalks, Gu Mo formed a hand seal. A sharp metallic energy coalesced at his fingertips—the Geng Metal Sword Qi—and with a flick of his wrist, he sent it sweeping across the field. The stalks fell in neat rows.  

In no time, the entire acre was harvested. Gu Mo then performed another hand seal and waved his gray outer disciple robe. The severed stalks flew into his sleeves as if drawn by an invisible force.  

This technique was called *Sleeve's Minor Cosmos*, a vastly simplified version of the legendary *Sleeve Cosmos*—a supreme divine ability created by a mighty cultivator. Just how simplified it was could be inferred from the fact that it was ranked alongside the most basic cleaning spells.  

Unlike storage treasures, *Sleeve's Minor Cosmos* didn't lighten the load of the items stored. The weight remained, and the technique required continuous spiritual energy to maintain. Most cultivators found it impractical—why bother with a spell that drained energy when a simple sack would do?  

But carrying a sack around hardly suited the dignified image of an immortal cultivator. That was why Gu Mo had learned the technique. More importantly, it served as a perfect cover for his Black Mist Space.  

He dared not reveal the existence of the Black Mist Space, but with *Sleeve's Minor Cosmos* as a disguise, he could freely use its storage capabilities—as long as he didn't retrieve anything obviously beyond his carrying capacity in front of others.  

A few hundred pounds of rice stalks were well within his limits. Thanks to his physique—three times stronger than cultivators of his level—carrying such a load was effortless.  

After storing the harvest, Gu Mo moved to the small plot in front of his hut where the three Sunflowers grew. Carefully, he dug them up, roots and soil intact, and transplanted them into pots.  

He couldn't leave the Sunflowers behind when heading to the Spiritual Plant Hall to register his harvest. If someone were to break in and discover them, the consequences would be disastrous. He still remembered the time intruders had entered his quarters back in the outer disciple district.  

As long as the Sunflowers were kept in pots with their soil, they would remain stable for several days without reverting to seeds. Once replanted, they would suffer no ill effects.  

Of course, this was only a temporary solution. When he had more Sunflowers in the future, this method would become impractical. By then, however, Gu Mo planned to set up formation arrays around his field for protection.  

For now, he needed to slowly accumulate resources. And this harvest marked the first step toward building his wealth in the world of cultivation.
