# Chapter 182: Husband? Sixth on the Hidden Dragon List!

Mei Hua Xuan.

This place was vast in area, with exquisite decoration that was luxurious without being ostentatious. The furnishings were elegant; anyone without a discerning eye wouldn't be able to tell just how expensive this antique-style setting was.

Stepping inside, one could hear the soft sounds of silk and bamboo music, seeming unreal, as if rising from the depths of the soul.

The three of them sat in a private room on the second floor.

It was the best spot for watching the performance, usually reserved for wealthy patrons.

"Quite the setup. High-class."

Li Mo sat in a Taishi chair.

After scanning the environment, he realized that both Bing Tuozi and Princess Jiang Chu Long were staring intently at the stage.

That was strange.

Would Bing Tuozi actually be interested in opera?

"What play is being performed today?"

"It seems... it seems to be about Big Brother Li and Sister Bing."

"Huh?"

Li Mo focused his gaze.

There was a 'Jiang Chen' character; this opera performer was a woman with passable looks. Her makeup was a bit heavy, but the character was recognizable at a glance.

The setting was a courtyard.

Li Mo didn't even need to watch to know which story this was.

Jiang Chen gets his engagement broken off, and Liu Wuyan fiercely protects her husband?

"Jiang Chen, my daughter has now joined the Snow Moon Sect and is a noble inner disciple. Meanwhile, you have wasted years and are still just a servant. Today, this old man has come to your door, you should know what for."

The villain was an old hand at acting.

Li Mo listened to a plot he knew by heart, but the way the actor delivered the lines didn't feel awkward at all.

(The Jiang family members were in an uproar.)

At this moment, 'Jiang Chen' looked resolute:

"Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river. Do not bully a young man who is poor!"

"Good!"

"Good performance, a reward is due."

Applause erupted from below. In a world that had never seen the 'broken engagement' genre, this scene was incredibly stimulating.

Li Mo silently covered his face.

As the plot continued, Liu Wuyan made her entrance, and the entire audience knelt down.

Only Jiang Chen remained standing.

Liu Wuyan walked up to him and called out 'Husband'.

The entire audience was petrified!

Then.

'Jiang Chen' curled his lip.

Li Mo: "....."

He remembered that he hadn't designed that lip-curling move.

Opera is fiction, not nonsense, don't just improvise freely!

Little Li felt like he was being publicly executed. Fortunately, his Bu Yun Lu shoes were of high quality, otherwise they would have been dug through by his toes.

He glanced sideways with his peripheral vision.

Jiang Chu Long was listening with great relish, as if she wouldn't get tired of listening to it a thousand times.

What about Bing Tuozi?

"Hu...sband?"

Ying Bing's deep, quiet eyes paused for a moment, then she let out a soft breath.

Opera is just opera after all.

If it were really based on her, how could she possibly say that? How could she possibly utter those two words?

She felt it was absurd and didn't want to look anymore.

But the opera continued, the sounds entering her ears one by one.

This play skipped over a lot of content, only picking out the key points.

For example, the romantic moments between the two, the two sleeping in the same bed, and even to help Jiang Chen practice his cultivation, the two 'stripped bare and faced each other'.

Mei Hua Xuan's professional quality was top-notch.

The various plot points were full of immersion, and the music配合着 the lighting, creating an experience as if one were there in person, causing wild thoughts to arise in one's heart.

"Let's practice..."

Ying Bing turned her head to look at the moon.

However, her gaze inevitably became lost again.

Those seductive sounds kept forcing their way into her ears.

The plot not only surfaced in her mind, but the male and female protagonists of the story always had her and Li Mo's faces.

It was as if... that was something that had happened to her.

And this feeling...

Ying Bing didn't know why she would look at Li Mo at this moment.

But she saw the handsome少年's face slightly red, sitting there like a dumb goose.

She didn't seem to dislike it?

"Good! That Liu Wuyan acted well!"

Just then, a deep voice came from the隔壁 room, followed by two handfuls of gold pearls being tossed down.

The crowd gasped in shock. Which wealthy patron was this?

Li Mo didn't pay much attention, but Jiang Chu Long asked curiously:

"Big Brother Li, what is this... what is this for?"

"If they are happy, they have too much money to burn, so they use money to tip."

Li Mo thought to himself that the play was finally over and smiled.

"Oh... so that's how it is..."

Jiang Chu Long rummaged through her pockets but only found a few copper coins, feeling too shy to take them out.

"Here."

Her arm felt heavy, and a half gold brick appeared in her hand.

Little Princess Jiang Chu Long looked up in confusion.

Li Mo said helplessly: "This is the smallest piece of gold I have on me."

"Thank you, Big Brother Li."

Jiang Chu Long didn't really have a concept of how much this gold was worth, so she mimicked the隔壁 room and threw it out.

Then....

Boom!!

The stage shook violently.

The actors thought they had performed poorly and angered the audience, only to realize what had been thrown down.

The scene immediately erupted in an uproar.

Who the hell brings a gold brick to tip at the opera?

Aren't they afraid of killing the performer?

The person from the隔壁 room also looked over, seeming stunned:

"Jiang... Li Mo?"

"Zhong Zhenyue?"

Li Mo recognized the对面 person. It was the young marquis Zhong, dressed in a python robe, holding a long spear, who was also undefeated on the arena.

The two weren't familiar with each other.

After exchanging polite pleasantries, a person walked up. It was one of the actors from the stage. She had wiped off her makeup and stood next to Zhong Zhenyue.

She looked like a clinging bird, but in reality, she was very restrained.

This woman's looks were only average to slightly above average, yet every frown and smile carried a seductive charm.

"Wait..."

Li Mo remained calm and activated his Heaven's Fate Divine Eye.

【Name: Yin Mianmian】

【Age: 23】

【Physique: Heavenly Luo Demon Beauty Body.】

【Realm: Eight Apertures of Observing the Divine.】

【Fate: Purple.】

【Recent Events: Manipulating Zhong Zhenyue, wanting to use his identity to sneak into Hengyun Sword City. Currently in a playful mood, wants to see the Host and Zhong Zhenyue fight.】

Hmm?

Li Mo's heart chilled.

The moment he saw the information, his vision blurred for an instant.

The sounds of silk and bamboo music in his ears suddenly became closer, like weeping and sobbing, emerging from his heart.

He saw a woman with naturally seductive bones, wearing hazy gauze, looking pitiful and lovely, walking towards him with resentment. She seemed to be taking a strange dance step.

Anyone would have their blood boiling in this situation.

However.

A sword light condensed from moonlight, as cold and clear as jade, as majestic as a god, slashed down in an instant.

It was Bing Tuozi.

No.

To be precise.

It was the Bing Tuozi Li Mo had observed.

The Meng娜 Sorbet imprinted in his soul shattered the illusion before his eyes.

And everything that had just happened occurred in an instant.

Zhong Zhenyue wasn't so lucky.

He had absolutely no guard against the woman beside him, his eyes were clouded, completely in a state of being charmed.

"You are so interesting..."

The woman saw Li Mo recover his clarity in an instant, a trace of surprise flashing in her eyes, but mostly excitement.

Every frown and smile of hers seemed to be able to pull at one's heartstrings.

Her figure flickered, seeming to want to get close to Li Mo, to rub against his ears and temples, to smell the scent on the少年's neck.

"Old woman."

Li Mo suddenly spoke.

"?"

Yin Mianmian's seductive charm froze, broken by anger.

The value of the Fighting King's Rules needs no further explanation.

In the blink of an eye.

*Swish—*

A spring breeze surged, sealing off her retreat.

Divine Skies descended, like heavenly punishment.

Frost Sword decisively slashed down, determined to split Yin Mianmian in two!
